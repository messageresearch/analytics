and we welcome him so tonight I welcome you all tonight in the name of Jesus Christ I'm glad to be back here uh once again back home I thank the Lord for giving us a very nice time to just have a vacation I cannot think when was the last time I went somewhere where I wasn't preaching and then had a couple days off yeah but this time we didn't we weren't preaching anywhere we had devotions

everything it then once in a while a big old yacht would go by like that and then Sandy goes uh honey honey verse 15. oh oh yeah yeah yeah you know I'm already thinking about something you know going

like talking about baseball you can talk about it you can learn all of the theory and everything but it's different when you get in the game it's different you got to get in the game and play the game when you get on the field it's the whole game changes so I thank the Lord for these young men coming up I see their ministering the ability getting better I'm pleased with them and so brother James and brother Stephen God bless them and we have our brother martin malumba he is going to be ministering for us this evening but I'm just proud of these young men that are coming up and Lord willing

Lord as Lord are we standing and understanding that it's because of your love that we're standing in this hour if it wasn't no father God for the shed blood we would be cast out [Music] lost in the darkness of this world but it plays you because you loved us so much [Music] chose to come down to leave all the Splendor of Heaven to come to our rescue father and in this hour you have chosen low father to come down again Lord because we looked for you we search for you with our own ways and we couldn't find you but Lord when we left all these things and then you came to our old rescue father [Music] by disgrace message that has been able Lord little bring our heart back low father to our position lost position father therefore Lord that's why we're saying we love you Lord yes thank you Father for this grace thank you Father for this message thank you for bringing out low father God a prophet many little father we see in the world are finding their own ways to be able of Father God to get to you father but Esther could sit low father God in the palace and being grateful to have had one who knew what the king wanted father we are so grateful in this hour help us Lord in humility to stay in our position and to follow father God the pattern and the instructions because one of these days as we see the father God the world getting shaken Lord by earthquakes and all kinds of things but Lord unto us shalom [Music] lead us Lord along the way as we look away unto you we ask all these things in Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen may God bless you thank you musicians well we're still standing we're going to take our Bibles was still in the Book of Luke 22 I know these two verses are taking a lot longer to go through but by God's grace will be able to get to it as much as as soon as possible 22 24 and there was also a try a strive among them meaning the disciples which of them should be accounted the greatest and he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles exercise leadership over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated but he shall not be so verse 26 but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger as he that is Chief as he that don't serve for whether he is greater he does he have admit or he that serveth is not he does he reflect me but I am among you as he that serveth yea a day which have continued with me in my Temptations and I appoint you unto a kingdom as my father hath appointed unto me that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on Thrones judging do 12 tribes of Israel we are still in the thoughts of the end times and the super race but God grace this will be part four as a we 've seen it tried to bring it but God's grace into all these stages the coming of the Lord in Babylon will try to get to that so it makes sense down the road so that it's not any confusion because all these things are in the message but God's grace we thank brother Ron once again for the opportunity to be able to stand here and as you just said earlier to practice rather than just sitting on the pews and also goes the same way as Jesus said that the one that serveth we also want to serve as much as possible the Lord also has been keeping me a little busy up and down in Mexico almost every other week it's uh quite uh quite an interesting chapter of my life after he had uh who wanted me to relocate uh I wasn't expecting it as much but you pray for me if you don't see me around just be aware that I should be somewhere in the country or somewhere in Mexico as the Lord leads yeah man yeah because I've been around this some of the brothers like we've we haven't seen you we haven't seen you just at least be aware I thought maybe I should because I've always been communicating with brother Ron but not as much with the church you forgive me for that uh so at least you know that uh I'm not just out there just not running away from Services instead with God's grace amen uh the end times and the super race we have been uh seeing as Jesus was dealing with the disciples he's been drawing them from the perception where they found them among themselves as Believers of their message of the hour we have seen illegal Prophet who have seen the revelation of the son of man and they got among themselves then they started thinking who is greater among Among Us and Jesus saying that it is starting now to explain to them where they came from and we tried to see that in the last few Services how the cultures and how Nimrod came about and things and uh we went about and uh we brought it along the church ages to show that these disciples among them there were also some unconverted Bunch who were people who were converts of Messengers who have brought messages along the church ages just as we also have in the church the three types of Believers the Believers the unbelievers and they make Believers and in this situation we find that these three types of believers they are part of the Bride they are part of the message they are part of the what is called the message of the hour not because they've chosen to be that but a God wanted it to be so because each one of us didn't just choose to stumble upon the message because we can see people in the world that have been crying out to God every day like you know show me the way but they just like you know lose their life just as brother Branham speak about Marilyn Monroe share before her death she was crying out and the god revealed it unto him he said that I know if I can get to her but God didn't allow it so therefore it is a privilege that God has granted unto us to come about the message and not only to be in the church called that we believe the prophet but also we have went on to be the True Believers and we have the Revelation to be the bride so you understand that you know that separation is quite important that the church attendance is not just a place where you come you listen to A good sermon because all of us will be listening to the sermons but then the unbeliever will just like you know shag it off and move on with their life continually but for the bride as these things are coming out they just get them closer and closer and closer and they're becoming it becomes more real and you look around you say you then you start to become aware as well speaks about the young lady when the young man from Chicago went to Colorado to seek a wife uh he give her a sign that you know upon around this time you see this you'll see these events start taking place then you know that I should be coming down while the rest of the cousins were sitting there standing or say like you know why are you dressing like that why are you doing this why are you doing that you know you're not even a classical people you're not you don't have a sorority out there you're not well known out there but then her mind was focused because there was a communication that had taken place and that communication to us today is the message of the hour and as the message has been given unto us now we have so much information that when you sit and you look around what happens in the news what a brother says what a man who backs their lives around you that was something and all that just awakens you makes you understand that you know this is the hour he told me that when you see this then pay attention to days and but that's great so that's where now ministers come into play they have a role to take these things and reverse them say them back and Echo them back and back again so that wherever where we find the Lord be discouraged and where we find a little bit uh trying to give up but these things are given unto us so for us to be strengthened as we go along the way we see that um the along the church ages or along the time Nimrod when it came about or his Spirit the devil and all these things it came about he had the people that have found a way in the church and has defined a way in the church and uh they were not converted people all they wanted to have the appearance of being Christians they could dress like Christians they could talk like Christians they could be fundamentally like you know very white he has all the scriptures to defend his position he has all these things but that was not following God's program why because they were not a bride but then at the same time it was very important for the bride to be aware of what these people were doing so that it's not just like oh I also know this quotation I also know that then there's just like you know no difference between knowing the message like anybody it can have access to the app or anything and the revelation of what is really taking place because brother Bonham shows us that bellam also had the altars they had the Lambs and speaking of the coming of the Lord and and all these things here but the difference between this the children of Israel were on God's program unto to the promised land but these ones here the reason of having all these altars and having all these things was just to make themselves a name and make themselves money so we find that that was what Nimrod wanted also to do he also had the three purposes to make himself a name his own religion and build a strong Nation by dividing the people and all these things that we can see that in the society in which we are living in today we have all this there's some things repeating again but then at the same time now Jesus turns around and says he shall not be so and when he said he shall not be so he has to show them what exactly that he says that he shall not be so that's why we see that sorry verse 25 he says like the kings of the Gentiles we saw cultures we saw countries we saw all these things a lot of ship over them and they that exercise Authority upon them which are the Gentiles are called benefactors why are they called benefactors we saw that when the unbelievers who were part of the message of the hour went and got married with the world with the church and with the politics then they became very powerful they had All the Monies they were able to control all the systems so um Ezra Branham says a Sumerian Church age program 76 now the introduction now Simeon means a business and comes from the word Mayor the first church age had lost the first love issue of Ephesian Church age and this church had begun to have a root of bitterness coming up in them because that this church the main Church the big part of majority of them was hammering against the Holy Spirit ruling in the church and they wanted to rule themselves they wanted to set a priesthood they wanted to act like the Old Testament people they wanted a priests if the pagan gods but they were they was converted they had priests and so forth and Jupiter and and Priests of Venice and so forth they wanted to bring them the the same thing to make these men in other words what we saw yesterday depending you can even see that in other parts of the country of the world that or even in the country tree you'll still have like you know people will still go bow before statutes and all these things but the progression of that spirit is still the same thing that after bowing before the statues and then they turned those into men and these men we call them as a president and you know this president has the right mindset he's the one who can change the economy and and everybody prays like oh we want this here we think like you know this is the one who can really change the whole thing but then for the bride when we look at God's program our prayer changes because to some extent the prophet will say like you know and we don't even pray for this country anymore because the country has taken a position and that position just set the course of the country just to Doom but then the rest of the society is like you know we're going to make America great again according to what scripture you know so when you when we understand human beings at times we just say you see the foolishness of men and you say like you know we have the greatest schools around but then by God's grace that's why we thank God for the message when you look at this and you say like you know all these promises will you may go to China you may go to Africa you may go wherever you want to be you see the same thing happening everywhere everybody is looking for a good president that can change the life that can increase the the minimum wage and that can have the best medical care out there but then at the end we see that all these are tied to the three dimensions that will just put you back in the grave again and there's no way out of it there's no president that has promised that you know if you vote for me by the time you die and after three days you're going to have a new body none but then these are the people who had all this money all these resources and they were unable to do anything and stuff and uh Branham uh shows us here in the programming Church age paragraph 62. now the Nicolaitans then had the formal side they had and they married the Pagan Pagan Church bringing in Pagan altars making Christian altars brought in a pagan God and made it speak and talk in form of the bishop president all that we want to call them both at work and all these things because many times we worship our bosses we love them so much like you know we run away from service but we can go so we can go to work set up there and rubbed it up and make it look like a god you see brother says you see no it's not what's on the outside it's what on the inside them two grains of cones looked the same it wasn't what was on the outside it was what was on on the inside because these two Spirits as we said at the last service that they just look like any one of us a politician would dress like any one of us the Catholic nuns will dress even at times better than our sisters because they have all this dress code and all these things but then the live inside was a whole different life and why would they be were they able to dress that way because they were also part of the church because they would have access to the Bible they have access to the message they can dress like that they can look like any one of us but the life behind the purpose the powerful thoughts they have it's a whole different program than what God has and this was now happening also in the church and Jesus said no you shall not be so you cannot be in the Church of the Living God and having all these powerful thoughts that I'm going to make myself a name I'm going to build a strong Nation I am going to do this here forgetting what God purpose is as is for our lives and he says see the inside the life well it was made there and that was the birth birthplace of early Catholic Church was the matter of all denominations paragraph 259 went dead fixed up this big thing all I want to tell you was have uh I want to tell you what had happened so that you will understand that was the birth of post millenniums because the church had gotten rich and it was as as rich as it could be and it was what powerful it was overstate State and church together so now the what I wanted to get to uh I had to recap a little bit because the what I wanted to get to is was that the systems that they used because along the age we have to understand for them to be able to govern the entire world and lead the things the way they're leading them God had to give them the opportunity to have certain agendas to have certain spirits to have certain political systems to have all kinds of things out there for them to be able to rule and by having these things in place then they were going to be able to fulfill this year because even it makes you fall standing with Jesus they said like you know all these kingdoms of the world belong to me if you just worship me I will give it to you that's what we see in our days each one of us is first to die with that same challenge depending on your level you can be a child you could be a mother you could be a father and any one of us we also face the very same challenge because when we face those uh political systems and they tell you for you to become this you need to follow this path for you to be this you need to follow this path here but then by God's grace when we see all those political systems when we see all these things they make us aware to understand that once I put my foot I choose this pathway this is what is going to happen to me and that turns our mind into a certain way we start speaking in that manner we start looking at our fellows in a certain manner because we have embraced those systems either because we grew up in an environment with that system without even knowing it from birth until 15 years old before you able to make your own decisions then all this year you reactions your speech and your mindset your perception of life is affected by what you've learned from those systems and those systems the word shows us here um teritarian Church age paragraph 133 make an image to her what would it be just what they're doing right now just exactly moving up the in this confederation of churches all the churches belong belong to this organization all into one group now they're getting uh they get the getting a Bible and Pope John invited them all back the aashi bishop Canterbury all going around first thing you know the whole thing comes right back to Mommy because there are lots to begin with see they say We'll join together in one big cause in one big in one big cause to fight communism and don't you know that God raise up communism I can prove it by by this bubble even and even put the minds to avenge the the the Saints and the blood that had shed upon the Earth God organized communism just as um just just the same as he did King Nebuchadnezzar to Israel he raised communism and someday should blow Roma Plum of Roman Plum of the earth that's exactly God said God said so that's right I'm against communism it's anti-god so it is but don't you pay so much attention to that Iron Curtain listen to this but watch that purple curtain what is brother Branham showing us he said like you know look at where that name wrote that whistle came into the church into nicolaidism turned into balaamism then turning into the religion of Jezebel that's what we call the Catholic system and the Catholic system is from Daniel's vision from that Catholic system into the entire world but then how does it get into the entire world he doesn't show up to everyone's Dole say like you know hey I am Jezebel and you have to join my system no that's the beauty of the message because anybody can read that quotation it's just like you know yeah they're talking about Rome and we are not in Rome so I'm not in Catholic Church no that's the beauty that the when you look at the message you say like you know Lord you love that so much and this world now this is where uh brother brought him shows it now the reason why I chose they're the title of the coming of the Lord in Babylon probably I will explain it even better uh God willing next time but here now we find that the Catholic system or romanism had went off teaching people the rules of hearts and rules of architecture and all these wonderful things and now depending on where you are in the world the level of access of romanism will Define the amplitude of Genesis 11. let me repeat that the level of access of romanism you have in the place where you have will determine the amplitude of Genesis 11. because remember in Genesis 11 that's when the Lord came down to see what the sons of man have built so now everywhere in the world you go that you see that not everything is at the same level some people are more advanced than others and what we call Advance today it's romanism because the Romans are the ones who have taught us how to build how to go about certain things when you go to Washington DC you can see all the buildings are made according to the pattern of Rome you see that brother Burnham shows us that America is the image of Rome but Roman itself is Europe where the founders of America were going back to Europe retrieving all the knowledge in order to build a better system than what they had experienced in Europe but by them doing such they were just fulfilling the scripture to build an image unto the Beast by building a system like an unto the Beast so it is also with the message the word comes also to be the believer to make the images of Christ so when we are dealing with the word we are not dealing with it just for knowledge purposes but we are building to become like him as we think to be like Jesus and to be like Jesus we need to have more information in order for us to turn a lock onto him like Mordecai coming to Esther to teach her how to be like watch the king lights because the rest of the women in the palace they could dress up however the one based upon whatever they see is out there but then the Brady of the of the the message of the hour comes to the bride to find an available heart to receive in order to produce the word to turn us to be uh the turn into the images of Christ but then before we get into the part of the Bride which we shall take unto us down the road then we see now that romanism as it went about he went into Russia he went to into Europe he went into England he went into uh Spain with all of you who can who have access to history can see how that romanism system is spread across the world and we see that according to uh the church ages in the age of the open door that I'm saying that I'm giving you this opportunity I'm opening the door that no man can shut but always remember that when the Revival comes it always brings out two seeds the two seeds are always coming along every time there's a Revival so now when this revival of the open door came about this wrong seed or Nimrod also went about to conquer all the world but those Believers under the message of the hour are the ones who receive the messenger and the message always sealed away and waiting Upon Our times so now as we see now that Nimrod has come through the entire world what does it do it teaches now people three types of the main political systems that we see out there and we see that here in the laodicean church age brother Branham says uh in the leodician church age program say brother Branham says age began around the turn of the 20th century Proverbs 1906. how long will it last as a servant of God who had did multiple uh multiples of visions of which none has ever failed let me predict I did not prophesy but I predict that this age will end around 1977. if you will pardon as a personal note here at best these prediction on seven major continuous Vision that came to me one Sunday morning in June 1933 as the prophet is standing there the Lord is coming down to find that this political system are not birthed at the time the prophet is receiving the vision but these political systems were already down the edges in forms of seeds wearing upon its manifestation and in order to fulfill the purpose of which God had wanted to fulfill his program because we can read about communism it didn't start with Russia but when when Karl Marx and all of them and went were sitting there and looking at every ideas that people were having they thought God allowed them to receive the thoughts in order for them to write those things and then certain countries will come and grab those things and in order to fulfill it that's what I said depending on the country where you at or where you are the access or the level or for the system of romanism will Define will determine the amplitude of Genesis 11 because in Genesis 11 we'll get to it let me know rashma said get ahead of myself says here the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the Lord was throwing nigh but that before he came seven major events will transpire you I wrote them all down um and that morning I gave I I gave forth the revelation of the Lord number one he says the vision was that was that Mussolini was would invade Ethiopia and that and and that Nation would fall as is at his steps the next Vision foretold that Austrian by name of other Adolf Hitler would rise up as a dictator over Germany and that he would draw the world into war now listen to this a third division the third Vision was the realm of excuse me was in the realm of uh in the in the realm of world politics for it shows me that there would be three great ISM fascism Nazism and communism but the first two would be swallowed up into the Third so now brother brought them now has his standing there in 1933 the Lord is now giving him all this information so that we may be aware of what is taking place because remember fascism and narcissism we see that back in Europe in a certain time in a certain period of time but then after a while the whole thing vanished but remember it's not because we don't speak about fascism and nationalism the word that the spirit has left because there's only two spirits the seed of God and the seed of discrepancy and this seed of discrepancy will take all steps of shape and forms but will still continue on just as we see in this uh in the Seven Seals we see that the very same Spirit the same first rose Rider that started as a white horse will turn into the red rose into a a black horse and into the Pearl holes but it's still the same Spirit continuing along the edges so it is now the semnim road taking the form of fascism taking the form of narcissism as we know in Germany and uh in Italy the purity of race and uh and against the Jews and all these things here but then you see that all these things gives takes us back to understand what Nimrod was doing back then to do what to make a name for himself because under these two first ones people thought that they were better than others that's what Jesus said that ye shall not be so because of the very same thing wherever you go in the world you may come from a one country uh in Africa in anywhere just like one of the brother was telling me that yeah you go to Africa people of tribe different tribes they kill each other you go in different parts of the world in South America like people kill each other on the streets and all this thing why because the very same spirit still rides on to think that they are better than others and the Lord now is opening unto us to see that hey look look at what is going to happen to those systems look it started somewhere it was very popular but look today we don't speak about it anymore but he says now I want you to watch where that is going because between that time we see that when the Fascism and narcissism had rise up and went down we also have things like socialism capitalism going around and doing its thing many of the European countries are are driven by socialism and and at times Africa though it's mainly driven by dictatorship and all these things but it's still the same spirit and this Same Spirit as we see it now under the capitalism we see that this big country had access for almost 400 years now that had they have access when you go into history you see how the Father the forefathers and they would request all these books from uh from you from Europe and to know how to learn and to know how to to spend the time and you read some funny stories that you know people at a very early stage of America people didn't even want to pay their taxes because they thought like you know no we left uh we left uh Europe and we were under the bridges uh suppression and you bringing us here to start paying our the taxes again we don't want this year but they'd had no choice but God's program had to be fulfilled and as the time went on this system of capitalism also went and crossed along the world why because God said that this is the nation that drunkens the entire world that brings that makes the people of the world wander as one would say back in Africa to say before to get to heaven you have to get to America first why because what they see on TV doesn't look like here on Earth because they can see the road systems because when we recall in the Bible in the time of uh Nebuchadnezzar he could have roads and that would go from the East to the west of his kingdom and we also have these countries now we'll get to China by God's grace that we have that this world that you see all the roles and beautiful things and you know you look around you back in the country where you could be you say like what kind of government do we have don't you when people you travel to those countries don't you see what they do you see so now the level of access of romanism determines the amplitude of Genesis 11. so now let's go back now to Genesis 11 I I had touched on it couple uh weeks back but um I couldn't really get to it as much but God's grace says he allows it to for us today we'll be able to go uh to get to wait as much as we can verse one and the whole Earth was of one language and not of one speech and it came to pass Journey from the e remember even also America we started from the East with the 13 colonies and we went all the way to the West that's why we have the saying of the uh what West it's a a speech that people find them under themselves they say like you know oh we like this saying so much but they don't realize that this what God is programmed for nimro to be able to do Anna to what extent is going to do it has been written in the word but to us As Americans we find it like you know oh look at what we've done and that this now will be a pardon or a sample for the rest of the world you see now that you know the rest of the world we want to be like America everything that America does the entire world wants to follow except for few countries of course for the reason why God wanted it to be that way in order for his program to come about and it came to pass as the journey from the East that they found a plane in the land of China uh we would say like you know in the land of America and they dwell there and they said one to another God too let us make brick and burn them truthfully and they had breakfast thorns and slime had a day for Morrow now we see now that as people were Journey from one part of the land into another Port they have now they had to have access to know how to make brick they had to learn how to make slime and and how to have the the chemistry knowledge in order to mix the molecules and and all these elements in order for them to achieve this great mind or this great thought they had in their minds remember they came about they destroyed the land the med Wars they call it colonies because they took over it was the edge of the open door and then from there now they have to build a kingdom and they say go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven we want to build a nation a nation where people rely on the intellect why because back in uh Europe especially in the UK for if you study history you'll see that what we have today is the King James version of the Bible is the result of the debate between the king and the people and as the people wanted access to the word so they had to have a compromise so that's why we call it the King James version so King James who was ruling at the time as a gift to the people he said like well we're going to give you a little bit of Freedom we're going to give you the word and by giving them the word people now had the understanding oh let us now have this freedom of worship let us now leave and go to a land where we can worship God but always remember as they were coming to this land with a Revival to worship God also the other seed was also following along with a different agenda but we're focusing at the time being just on the seat of discrepancy the bright side will come at its appointed time as they came about they had access to knowledge when you go if you have ever you take the time to travel from the East to the West you can see the progression of the nation the homes how they were built how small they were and the roads are small they are and as you come to the West the country gets bigger and bigger and perfect and more beautiful and more nicer why the access to romanism because when you look at for instance uh the capital as it was uh built I believe in 1800 if I'm not mistaken you see that prior to that they didn't have any they would meet uh just in a certain home or in a certain place and they would make all these debates and what kind of country do we want kind of uh voting system do we want we don't want her to have a system where people are and learn to just go and cast the vote without knowing what they're voting for because we don't want the power in the hands of just few mans as it was in Europe but without them knowing that they were just building the very image of that system they left because it was just the very same Spirit coming along and down the road after they have built all these things what did they turn that into turning now into the very system they left and start dominating and leading the entire world into sin why because the spirit behind it and now these Sons and Daughters of God who are now found into these systems the Lord also comes about to give them understanding to see like you know hey watch those systems how they started look at how they're going and watch how they're going to end up that's why they said like you know God raises communism not because as like you know many times you see on the news some of uh the Bishops who said like you know we're going to pray and we're going to fight communism as we just read it here you say like you know don't pay attention to that pay attention to that purple curtain watch to that system that comes at your doorsteps without you even realizing the system that gets into your home and telling you that you don't have your rights until to your children anymore that system that comes at your doorsteps and tells your girl that you can also be a man because they have access to knowledge and this knowledge made them understand how the human body is formed how they can retrieve a certain hormones and puts other owners to start changing their bodies you were born a man but at times you look at the person you can tell if it's a woman or a man down the road who would he that was a uncle Johnson now become sister I don't know and when you look at it it's funny but it is true and this is where Genesis 11 comes into play the Lord is saying like you know look at what how much access they have how much knowledge they have and by having access to that they're going to do exactly that let us build us a city the Forefront they say like you know what kind of country do we want we want where people can express the mind because back in Europe they were not given that opportunity therefore brother Nam says it is very important for us as Believers to have this knowledge not to start some Riot among us but to understand and to what are we called what kind of people are we supposed to be so we can look in ourselves they say like you know Lord these things here this I am better I am this I I am more knowledgeable I am all this year that's good to have knowledge but remember let not your knowledge let not your access to information turns you into the image of the Beast because by having access to knowledge look at what city the children of God have built they have access to know how to build the best building in the world very quickly as we see even in China has their building uh during coffee they were able to build probably like in six days of a big hospital that the world was so amazed why access to the very same system by having that access the man has improved themselves but also at the same time as the world is improving itself what should happen now to the Believers to stay with a revelation of 70 years ago no we have access to the world but the Revelation must get greater and greater as the day go by because as I said that you know you look at the East the houses were so small but as you move forward the house are bigger and they are built more faster than yesterday so having now access that also to the world should also Untitled us with all these ministers that have been around with all these experiences giving us tools to know how to be better Christians than yesterday by having now these principles with us then we are able not to understand what are we supposed to be that you can tell me anything no understand the principle Pastor you can show me tell me what to do no understand the principles because that the children of men have looked on to others who have went on before them to build a much better system than what was yesterday and now we are in the edge of AI with a artificial intelligence it's learning and making improvements over and over and over by making these improvements now they are able to tell you like oh imagine you live in a world where AI is able to detect your disease better than your doctor could be able in a million years with technology in six months AI was able to resolve questions that would have been resolved in a billion years in six months we had to wait a billion years to have the understanding but now ai by collecting all this information is able to treat it in six months then we know how the human brain should work how the DNA is made how this year why this year and now we're going into a stage of a personal capitalism this personal capitalism they want to know when do you sleep how many times did you wear that shirt when are you ready to buy a new shirt this is the system where it's getting better and better every day and you still have people who's just like you know although I'm me I I just read the message no you need more revelation you need to get deeper in the world and as you get deeper in the world it becomes more clearer and as the world comes on the pulpit is not just some basic elements but some higher standard element that when one word is said that everything is understood that could have been preached in five six seven sermons that's where we are called down to because when we have to speak because when you look at the children of Israel in the wilderness they're still there they heard God speaking I am the Lord thy God but from where they were they were only hearing Thunders God had a language a higher language but at where they were they couldn't hear it but God was able to show them that I could bring you to the stage where the Prophet was for you to be able to also hear and understand the language that's why in this hour now the Thunder's being revealed is not given unto us to remain in our former stage but instead not to get into a higher realm where we can understand and hear God's language because the Elijah standing there in the cave he said you know what am I doing here the voice says what are you doing here when you come here why are you here he said job good that loins I'll speak to you as a man where were you when I was laying the foundation of the world but job couldn't understand the language drug was not improved enough for him to understand who am I so there it is also with us today we are called unto the higher Revelations we were once up eaglets in the barnyard but we are not called just to remain English in the barnyard but we are called now to eat the fresh food the spiritual food induces them to get all the strength we need in order to fly up in the sky because this is the hour in which we are living in and now as now they were steady standing there the Bible says verse 5 and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built and as the Lord was coming down he came down there right there in Babylon the Lord came right there to see what they were doing just as the Lord came down in Genesis 19. he said like I came to see for myself what Sodom has done the Lord come all comes also down in this hour to see what also America and the rest of the world have built and now when the Lord comes now in your life what have you built when the Lord comes in our church what have we built are we like the disciples wanting to see Iraq in the church what are we building the Lord coming down in Babylon and as he comes down in Babylon he founds the age in a certain condition but he says that you know nevertheless I have my seeds also among them people and by God's grace to will be able like you know say God willing in the future now to start getting into there to see what does the Lord do what are these decisions and and on and on and on because like you know as I said the end times and the super race because that there's the seed of discrepancy there's also the child seed born from the pure word of God that brings now into maturity that's why I gave you the title the end times and the super race and as we go on it was important for us to break it down for us to understand what is happening in what world that we're living in what are we embracing what is the focus of our mind and by this year we see that the when the Lord comes down it does certain things it comes down it shows the prophet what is taking place in the land what are they doing what are they building and how is going to happen he says but the first two all these ISM or all these political systems will be swallowed up into the Third because when God comes down it comes with a specific message he said that my world I've created I've led to the devil do Roman do whatever you want to do all these years but very soon the kingdoms of the world becomes the kingdom of Our Lord this word is so precious from every angle that you look when you don't have God's program with you we just go to church we go make ourselves as much money as possible and by making as much money as possible without God's programming of Our Lives what do we turn unto the image of the Beast because remember there came a time where men could not sell could not do anything without the mark and this Mark is the rejection of the word by rejecting the word we take knowledge and it turns us into the image of the Beast and the choice is ours and that's what the Jesus now is also is keep showing the disciples that we can see that verse 25 25 so far has taken us almost three to four services in order for us to see what's going on and then he said then but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger will get into what is as the younger for us to see what is to be young wonderful things that the Lord has for us in this world by God's grace time always runs out by God's grace but I believe this small thoughts to show these political systems how they came about what is the purpose behind it's not to make of us to give us a continuing City no but it's to shape a image unto the Beast let's not be fooled let the Lord to each one of us be able to reveal to us what is that in our lives because I just spoke it in a very high level speech but then how does these political systems affect our speech affect our perceptions what we say how it hurts people how you it's discriminatory and all these things here let God open that unto us and then from there we'll be able to see what will happen next shall we pray as the musician come Heavenly Father I'm so grateful Lord for their Grace and love as the word comes out in humility and simplicity when Lord we surrender unto you you always come about Lord to do your father got the job thank you Father once again as Lord we are looking away unto you for what comes up next may you love father God reveal that word let it mean Our Father God be knowledge just another sermon to us from the pulpit to the last row but instead Lord to go deeper into these things because time will fail afloat to break into every single part Lord may your grace and your love fill our hearts Lord without no father God and you with us Lord these things are just noises we all shag it off and and we'll carry on with what we continually do but then when we see what is taking place in the world we cannot truly see that today the scripture is fulfilled father because you have said it many years ago many couldn't see it many left it and passed and without even saying it but we're standing in this hour we're seeing all this revolution in the world may you love father God come to us and teach us more may you follow the prophet message for deliverance to each one of us heal us no father God in our bodies but most importantly our soul lord our theophanese may be aligned with you because by saying this Lord we know how to walk we know what to embrace Lord we look away unto you we ask and we pray all the things and with Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name amen may God bless you my goal Tried by fire like gold Tried by fire we need the refiner pure by our
