[33:16] trust that this will be for someone
[33:17] tonight Isaiah chapter 5 and verse vers
[33:21] 1 through 7 I have a lot of rebound back
[33:25] here Brothers I don't know if we can
[33:27] touch that up a little bit that would be
[33:30] great thank you very much verse one says
[33:32] now I will sing to my beloved a song of
[33:35] my beloved touching his Vineyard my well
[33:38] beloved hath a Vineyard in a very
[33:40] fruitful Hill and he fenced it and
[33:43] gathered out the stones thereof and
[33:45] planted it with the the choicest vine
[33:48] and built a tower in the midst of it and
[33:51] also made a wine press
[33:53] therein and he looked that it should
[33:55] bring forth grapes and it brought forth
[33:58] wild grapes wow so we see here this this
[34:02] husbandman he went through uh he he went
[34:06] to great great depths and and did a lot
[34:08] of things to make this Vineyard uh a
[34:11] very good and and and beautiful Vineyard
[34:14] he he fenced it and he did everything he
[34:17] could to it in order for it to bring
[34:18] forth uh good fruit but what did it
[34:21] bring
[34:22] forth it brought forth a wild grapes
[34:26] instead of regular grapes grapes and now
[34:29] inhabitants of Jerusalem and Men of
[34:31] Judah judge I pray you between me and my
[34:34] Vineyard what could have been done more
[34:37] to my Vineyard than I have not done in
[34:40] it wherefore when I looked that it
[34:42] should bring forth grapes brought it
[34:45] forth wild grapes and now go to I tell
[34:49] you what I will do to my Vineyard I will
[34:51] take away the Hedge thereof and I will
[34:54] and it shall be eaten up and break down
[34:56] the wall thereof and it shall be trotten
[34:58] down and I will lay it waste it shall
[35:01] not be pruned nor digged but there shall
[35:04] come briers and Thorns I will also
[35:08] command the clouds that they rain no
[35:10] rain upon it for the vineyard of the
[35:13] Lord of hosts is the house of Israel and
[35:16] the man of Judah his Pleasant plant and
[35:19] he looked for judgment but behold
[35:21] oppression for righteousness but Behold
[35:25] a cry amen you may be seated this
[35:28] evening we trust that the Lord will add
[35:31] the blessing to the reading of the word
[35:33] amen I would like to title my sermon
[35:35] tonight this is uh part three of nebba's
[35:38] Vineyard and I would like to take for a
[35:41] subject of the husband of the vine the
[35:45] husbandman of the vine now the first
[35:48] time that uh a Vineyard is mentioned
[35:51] within the scripture is found in Genesis
[35:54] 19: 20- 27
[35:58] and it says and Noah began to be a
[36:01] husbandman and he planted a Vineyard now
[36:04] if you want to know what a husbandman is
[36:06] is just a farmer it is a man who tills
[36:09] the ground who wants to bring forth who
[36:12] plants something and wants to bring
[36:13] forth a crop or a fruit and he drank of
[36:16] the wine and was drunken and he was
[36:20] uncovered within his tent and ham the
[36:23] father of Canaan saw the nakedness of
[36:25] his father and told his two Brethren
[36:28] without and Sham and japeth took a
[36:30] garment and laid it upon their shoulders
[36:32] and went backward and covered the
[36:34] nakedness of their father and their
[36:36] faces were backward and they saw not
[36:39] their father's nakedness now Noah woke
[36:42] from his wine and knew what his younger
[36:45] son had done unto him and he said cursed
[36:47] be Canaan a servant of servants shall he
[36:50] be unto his Brethren and he said blessed
[36:53] be the Lord God of Shem and Canan shall
[36:55] be his servant God shall enlarge japeth
[36:59] and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem
[37:02] and Canaan shall be his servant so
[37:06] whenever you read this
[37:09] scripture you wonder to yourself well I
[37:12] wonder what was the the character of ham
[37:15] what was uh how did he approach his
[37:19] brothers whenever he had walked in and
[37:21] he had seen his dad in this the drunken
[37:24] state that he was in uh was his
[37:27] immediate reaction trying to say well uh
[37:30] this is kind of embarrassing I I I I
[37:33] need to step out a second or I need to
[37:35] cover my father's nakedness because he's
[37:38] been drunken with wine and and he's not
[37:40] in his right mind and and and this is
[37:42] kind of embarrassing for the whole
[37:44] family but instead of helping his dad in
[37:47] a time of need uh the character of ham
[37:50] really started to shine through when he
[37:53] went to his brothers and no doubt he
[37:55] went to his Brethren and he began to
[37:57] laugh and he began to Snicker because
[38:00] understand that's what the seed of the
[38:01] serpent does they laugh and they Snicker
[38:05] and they make fun of the seed of God so
[38:08] no doubt he went and he told his two
[38:10] brothers and he said hey watch Dad Dad
[38:13] is drunken with wine and he he's laying
[38:16] in the tent and he's uncovered go and
[38:18] check this out this is so embarrassing
[38:21] for
[38:22] Dad but the two brothers of of the two
[38:26] other brothers they they realized the
[38:29] seriousness because they had a respect
[38:32] for their father that's something that a
[38:35] lot of us uh need to be reminded once in
[38:37] a while is respect for our mother and
[38:40] for our fathers especially the older we
[38:44] get you know uh it's very easy to to
[38:46] lose respect for Mom and Dad but it's
[38:49] important for us to keep respect for our
[38:52] mom and dad because it is a commandment
[38:54] of the Lord to respect your mother
[38:57] mother and your father
[38:59] amen it doesn't have an age category on
[39:02] it it doesn't mean whenever you get
[39:04] older andever you have your own family
[39:06] and you have your own children that now
[39:08] you have the opportunity to disrespect
[39:10] mom and disrespect Dad no the Bible
[39:12] tells us age doesn't matter respect Mom
[39:16] and Dad
[39:19] amen and so we see that this attitude of
[39:23] of ham now was was starting to to to
[39:26] show forth of the lineage of where he
[39:29] came from because we know that the
[39:32] lineage of Cain came through ham in the
[39:36] ark now are some of you ready for some
[39:40] Christianity 101 amen say Amen okay here
[39:45] we go here's our youth meeting
[39:48] tonight because we understand that as
[39:52] Christians we are not to partake of
[39:55] strong drink alcohol or liquor and let
[39:59] me put in there also
[40:02] wine you say how can you say that
[40:04] brother stepen well the scripture
[40:06] declares it have you ever been uh have
[40:09] you ever been asked you know why don't
[40:11] you drink why don't you smoke everybody
[40:15] else does why don't you do it have you
[40:17] ever been stumped and you wonder well I
[40:20] just do it because uh mom and dad said
[40:22] so or because the preacher said so and
[40:25] you don't have a scripture to back up
[40:27] why you don't do these simple things
[40:29] that the rest of the world does and we
[40:31] don't do it as Christians well here's
[40:33] your scriptures tonight Proverbs chap 20
[40:36] and verse one it says wine is a
[40:40] mocker strong drink is Raging and
[40:43] whosoever is deceived
[40:46] thereby is not
[40:49] wise so in other words if you're
[40:52] deceived by strong drink if you are
[40:54] mocked by by uh if you're mocked by by
[40:58] by by wine and the drung drink guess
[41:01] what you are not
[41:02] wise you are a foolish
[41:09] person whosoever is deceived
[41:13] thereby is not wise so what do we learn
[41:18] from liquor and strong drink and taking
[41:21] wine in abundance we learn that it is a
[41:25] deception and it deceives the foolish
[41:28] into thinking that it's okay even as
[41:31] Believers so you might say well this is
[41:34] just for denominational Christians and
[41:37] and denominational Christians uh they
[41:39] believe in having a a social drink
[41:41] around a social Gathering but I think
[41:44] would we we would be very amazed to see
[41:47] the people within the message who are
[41:50] into social
[41:52] drinking who are deceived within
[41:55] themselves and are not WI
[41:58] eyes because they have given themselves
[42:01] over to strong drink Isaiah
[42:04] 5:1 woe unto them that rise early in the
[42:08] morning that they may follow strong
[42:10] drink in other words watch out for that
[42:13] person the person that wakes up early in
[42:15] the morning and they're they're chasing
[42:17] after a drink to drown their sorrows or
[42:20] to make the pain go away watch out for
[42:23] that person earmark that person stay
[42:26] away from that person
[42:28] why that continue in the night till wi
[42:30] and Flame him Proverbs 31:
[42:34] 4-5 it is not for Kings o Lemuel it is
[42:39] not for Kings to drink wine nor for
[42:43] princes strong
[42:45] drink let me put Believers in there
[42:49] because you are all Kings and you are
[42:52] priests onto the Lord so it is not onto
[42:55] thee Oh mess
[42:58] believer to drink of wine and strong
[43:02] drink what is the purpose why lest they
[43:06] drink and forget the
[43:09] law and pervert the Judgment of any of
[43:14] The
[43:15] Afflicted why because when a person is
[43:18] stim is under the influence of this
[43:21] strong drink and liquor and alcohol and
[43:23] whatever it may be you know it's not
[43:25] mentioned within the scripture but let
[43:27] me put it in there let me put in there
[43:29] medical
[43:31] marijuana Amen Let me put in there
[43:33] anything else anything else that that
[43:36] takes our uh uh our senses away from
[43:41] us whether it be medical marijuana me
[43:45] whether it be marijuana in itself
[43:47] whether it be medications prescribed
[43:49] from a doctor or whoever it may be if it
[43:52] takes away and it dos our senses there's
[43:55] something wrong
[43:58] you know we don't need pills to heal us
[44:01] of our infirmities we need the blood of
[44:04] Jesus
[44:06] Christ but if you have to take something
[44:09] once in a
[44:10] while please feel
[44:14] free
[44:17] Hallelujah but saints of God understand
[44:20] this as it just comes to my heart you
[44:22] know so much of the time we're in a
[44:25] hurry to run to the doctor
[44:27] so much of the time we're in a hurry to
[44:29] go to urgent care we're in a hurry to go
[44:31] over here we're in a hurry for a
[44:33] prescription because we want the
[44:35] prescription to make us feel better but
[44:37] what if we would just stop hurrying to
[44:40] the hospital hurrying to the doctors and
[44:42] hurry to Dr
[44:45] Jesus we might get a prescription
[44:47] that'll heal us right on the spot but a
[44:51] lot of the times we're not giving him
[44:53] his our first choice amen
[44:58] we're so quickly to go I got to go to
[44:59] the doctor I got to go hey if we got to
[45:02] go we got to go but if it's not life and
[45:05] death how about you give Jesus a
[45:10] chance
[45:12] Hallelujah you know the fault that I
[45:15] have especially with the kids you know
[45:18] my kids my kids have to be extremely
[45:22] sick in order for me to take them in
[45:25] like there will be times I'll I'll tell
[45:27] ashin ashy let's just wait let's just
[45:30] give the Lord a day and we'll pray okay
[45:33] let's just wait a little longer and all
[45:35] of a sudden this gets worse and it gets
[45:37] worse and it gets worse and she's saying
[45:39] honey maybe we should take the child in
[45:42] I say okay you know brother brandom did
[45:45] the same thing with sister ma whenever
[45:48] she had that big old tumor or whatever
[45:50] it was he said oh doc just let's just
[45:52] just give the Lord a chance and and he
[45:54] kept postponing it and postponing it
[45:57] postponing it until finally they went in
[45:59] to do the uh uh the examination and they
[46:02] went in to to to take that thing out and
[46:04] all of a sudden it wasn't
[46:07] there wonder how many of us do we have
[46:10] faith enough to postpone things to give
[46:13] God a chance to heal our bodies God help
[46:17] us I said God give us a little bit more
[46:20] faith you say brother Stephen you're
[46:23] kind of walking out on a limb here and
[46:25] telling people not to go to the doctors
[46:27] that's not what I'm saying understand
[46:29] what I'm saying I'm saying give Jesus
[46:31] first and give him the opportunity to
[46:35] heal our ailments
[46:39] amen said uh verse five of Proverbs lest
[46:43] they drink and forget the law and
[46:45] pervert the Judgment of any of The
[46:47] Afflicted what happens when we drink and
[46:51] we forget the
[46:52] law we become
[46:55] fools we foret for get the law of God we
[46:58] forget the teachings of the Lord and all
[47:01] of a sudden we afflict we we we pervert
[47:04] the Judgment of
[47:05] God upon The
[47:08] Afflicted Proverbs 23: 19 through 22
[47:14] hear thou my
[47:16] son listen to this and be wise don't be
[47:21] foolish but be wise and guide thine
[47:25] heart in thee
[47:27] way be not among wine
[47:31] bibbers among riotous Eaters of Flesh
[47:35] for the drunkard and the Glutton shall
[47:37] come to poverty and drowsiness shall
[47:40] clothe a man with Rags hearken onto thy
[47:44] father that begat thee and despise not
[47:47] thy mother when she is
[47:51] old
[47:53] Hallelujah why does it tell us not to be
[47:56] around why bibbers why does it tell us
[47:59] not to be among the riest Eaters of the
[48:01] flesh I'll tell you why because it's
[48:04] easier to pull somebody down from a
[48:06] chair than it is to pull somebody up
[48:09] whenever you hang around the wrong crowd
[48:11] whenever we get around the the crowd of
[48:13] the wine bibbers guess what we're going
[48:15] to want to become wine bibbers why
[48:20] because we are we are attaching
[48:23] ourselves with that spirit and now we
[48:26] think hey well this is what everybody
[48:27] else is doing so I'll just do the same
[48:29] thing don't be a fool don't be foolish
[48:33] but be wise and stay away from that kind
[48:36] of
[48:37] company say brother Stephen that's just
[48:40] for the Youth oh I'm sure it's for a lot
[48:41] of older people too you got to watch
[48:43] your company you got to watch who you're
[48:45] hanging around with you got to watch the
[48:47] guys at work yeah you think you're just
[48:49] uh because you're old that you have all
[48:52] this wisdom and and you can just hang
[48:54] around and go wherever you want to go to
[48:56] that's not how how it works A little
[48:58] leaven leavens the whole lump God help
[49:03] us I told you it was a little youth
[49:05] meeting tonight so all the adults you
[49:07] can say Amen with me but if it hurts you
[49:10] can just stay quiet because you know
[49:12] it's the
[49:13] truth put your toes in your shoes like
[49:17] this huh a lot of you are getting a calf
[49:19] workout right now CU
[49:22] you're ah this
[49:25] guy I'm not not preaching at you I'm
[49:28] preaching for you I'm preaching at the
[49:31] Devil I'm preaching to remind you to put
[49:34] you in a a little bit of remembrance of
[49:36] of the company that you're keeping and
[49:38] stay away from from alcohol and drink
[49:40] and cigarettes and smoke and marijuana
[49:42] and the things that dulls our senses
[49:44] because that's what Satan wants to do to
[49:46] us in this age of Lady OA he wants to
[49:49] dull our senses to the voice of God in
[49:51] this
[49:52] day
[49:54] true so you might say that uh it's the
[49:58] Bible says that it's it's okay for me to
[50:00] take a little bit of wine because the
[50:03] Bible says it's it's okay for thy
[50:05] stomach sake and thy often
[50:08] infirmities I wonder how many people
[50:10] have been Have Become consumed by Wine
[50:14] and Liquor because they start off with a
[50:17] little bit of wine for there often
[50:19] infirmities in their
[50:21] stomach I wonder how many people has it
[50:24] set off on the wrong track and it's
[50:26] taken them off the straight and narrow
[50:28] way and and it may not have happened
[50:30] overnight but over a couple of years and
[50:33] before they know it they have a fullon
[50:35] addiction to to to all these things that
[50:38] we've already mentioned why because they
[50:40] started off with a little bit of
[50:43] wine but you don't understand brother
[50:46] it's for my
[50:48] stomach it's to help me feel better well
[50:52] if you would just take a a natural
[50:54] remedy of something that'll clean out
[50:57] your stomach once in a while it might
[50:59] make the infirmities in your stomach
[51:01] feel a little bit better you don't have
[51:03] to take wine for those things
[51:09] right I believe that it's important for
[51:12] us we're going to be taking communion
[51:15] here in a couple of
[51:16] weeks imagine and and just just just
[51:20] imagination right imagine you take a
[51:24] glass of wine a night for the stomach
[51:27] sake and then you come up before
[51:31] communion and it doesn't mean anything
[51:33] to you it's is wine I already drink it
[51:37] every night just a glass it's it doesn't
[51:40] really do anything for me it takes away
[51:43] the sincerity of the Holy Communion that
[51:46] God Has are has given us to do amen
[51:50] that's just wine not a big deal but try
[51:54] taking that little shot of wine did you

[55:37] honeymoon he took her on a hunting trip
[55:39] and and so on and so forth perhaps uh
[55:42] brother brandham at times wasn't the
[55:44] best loving husband to his wife because
[55:46] he was so busy serving the people of of
[55:49] this
[55:51] generation and she just had enough and
[55:54] she couldn't take any more of it and she

[56:07] him and and everything and he says no I
[56:10] have a word from the
[56:11] lord well now it got real
[56:14] serious real serious something began to
[56:17] form within here why I can say this
[56:21] because God wanted to fulfill his word
[56:24] in her life through a a a a spoken word
[56:27] miracle but also because of this why did
[56:31] it happen it was a lesson for every one
[56:33] of us both husbands and wives and young
[56:36] people am that are reaction to one
[56:40] another to our husbands and wives and
[56:42] moms and dads it has an
[56:44] effect on our spirit it has an effect on
[56:48] our lives and not for the
[56:52] betterment very good you ever see
[56:55] somebody
[56:57] and you ever see somebody that didn't
[56:58] have a good upbringing as a
[57:01] child and they're an adult and you can
[57:04] tell on their Spirit their spirit is
[57:07] still
[57:07] affected maybe they hide it in the flesh
[57:10] they they they can't see it yet you
[57:12] can't see it and you don't notice it but
[57:14] yet within their Spirit their spirit is
[57:17] marked their Spirit has been
[57:21] defiled because they weren't treated the
[57:24] right
[57:25] way and because their spirit is defiled
[57:28] it affects their walk with
[57:30] God my brother my
[57:33] sister may God help us to talk to each
[57:38] other appropriately Amen to talk to each
[57:41] other with love and

[58:50] of God that's right we ought to be loyal
[58:53] one to another not just when somebody is
[58:56] loyal to us but when they turn their
[58:58] backs on us we ought to still try to be
[59:00] loyal with them and re why because if we

[59:32] overreacting don't let your prayers be
[59:34] hindered to God because of how you're
[59:37] talking one to another very good
[59:40] Hallelujah but soften amen soften your
[59:45] spirit with
[59:48] prayer you know this is none of this
[59:52] just so you know is I didn't even think
[59:54] about any of this stuff but I'm just
[59:57] preaching you know what how you speak to
[1:00:00] a boy is different than how you speak to
[1:00:01] your girls you know I speak to my boys
[1:00:05] got stop it knock it off what are you
[1:00:09] doing son get up you know you're a
[1:00:11] little bit more harsh with the boys than

[1:00:17] something and I thought it was one of
[1:00:19] the boys what are you doing and she
[1:00:22] looks at me and my goodness her little

[1:00:29] know her little face I looked at her and
[1:00:31] I thought honey I said I am so sorry it
[1:00:36] absolutely melted my heart to see the
[1:00:39] reaction on her little three-year old
[1:00:42] face that Daddy just talked to her with
[1:00:45] kind of a mean
[1:00:48] voice and I was quick to
[1:00:52] apologize to my little three-year-old
[1:00:54] daughter why cuz I don't want to harm
[1:00:56] her little spirit amen I don't want her
[1:00:59] thinking that dad is just some mean guy
[1:01:02] that's that that's always shouting and
[1:01:04] always doing stuff and always you know
[1:01:06] uh getting on my case and everything and
[1:01:08] I'm all about correction believe me and
[1:01:12] so is my
[1:01:14] wife
[1:01:16] but I'm all about showing the love and
[1:01:20] the grace because there's a balance amen
[1:01:25] there's a balance with the strictness
[1:01:27] there's a balance with the hardness and
[1:01:29] it should be balanced with love and with
[1:01:32] Grace amen saints of God we ought to
[1:01:36] give each other room to
[1:01:38] fail you need to give your children you
[1:01:42] young couples I don't know where you're
[1:01:43] at you need to give your children space
[1:01:47] to fail because if they feel like they
[1:01:50] can never fail they'll always feel like
[1:01:53] a failure and never be able to pick
[1:01:55] themselves up when they fall down but
[1:01:58] when you give them space to
[1:02:01] fail they realize I have this room here
[1:02:04] I can get back up I can go to Mom I can
[1:02:07] go to Dad so it is within the church
[1:02:10] amen we need to give each other a little
[1:02:12] bit of space to fail a little bit of
[1:02:16] space to fall down that we know hey we
[1:02:19] failed but it's not the end of the world
[1:02:22] we failed but not everybody is against
[1:02:24] me I have room I can get back up I can
[1:02:27] go to my pastor I can go to the Deacon I
[1:02:30] can ask for counsel and I can ask for
[1:02:32] help and I won't have the finger being
[1:02:34] pointed at me very
[1:02:37] good
[1:02:39] hallelujah it's okay to
[1:02:42] fail but keep getting back up amen it's
[1:02:46] okay to do something wrong once in a
[1:02:49] while just don't be
[1:02:51] foolish and do it again get back up put
[1:02:55] it under under the blood and walk
[1:02:58] on
[1:03:01] Amen we find that Noah had Noah found
[1:03:04] Grace in the sight of the Lord because
[1:03:07] uh not only did he recognize the voice
[1:03:10] of God when it spoke to him but he he
[1:03:13] recognized it and had put him into
[1:03:16] action into building the ark because
[1:03:18] remember the Bible says that Noah found
[1:03:20] Grace in the sight of the Lord and he
[1:03:23] found Grace because he was able to not
[1:03:26] only hear the voice and the word of God
[1:03:29] that was that would put him into action
[1:03:31] and build the ark but he found Grace
[1:03:33] that he had a heart to be able to
[1:03:36] receive the message by the voice of God
[1:03:40] each and every one of us here this
[1:03:42] evening we have found Grace in the very
[1:03:45] eyes of God himself why because I've
[1:03:48] heard his voice not only have I heard
[1:03:50] his voice I have a heart to receive what
[1:03:54] that voice said and to put what that
[1:03:56] voice said into action thank you Lord
[1:03:59] talk about
[1:04:02] Grace what did the voice say it said
[1:04:04] come out be separate come out over my
[1:04:07] people come out of the things of the
[1:04:08] world come out of those denominations
[1:04:10] and be separated be a separated people
[1:04:13] not onto
[1:04:15] yourselves but onto
[1:04:18] me because when God has us in a place of
[1:04:21] Separation now he wants to dress us with
[1:04:24] his word thank you why does he want to
[1:04:27] dress us with his word because when he
[1:04:29] returns his word is the only thing that
[1:04:32] he's going to be able to recognize and
[1:04:34] when he recognizes his word that's who's
[1:04:37] going to go with them because we are a
[1:04:39] part of the word praise the
[1:04:46] Lord be
[1:04:48] encouraged my brother and my sister
[1:04:51] because this is not our final resting
[1:04:53] place Jesus said go to prepare a place
[1:04:56] for you that where I am there you may be
[1:04:59] also he said in my father's house are
[1:05:01] many mansions and if I go I will come
[1:05:04] back again and receive you to myself
[1:05:07] that's what we're waiting for this
[1:05:08] evening that's why we're here at our
[1:05:10] post of Duty why because we're watching
[1:05:13] and we're waiting for the soon coming of
[1:05:16] the Lord I say father even so come
[1:05:19] quickly
[1:05:21] amen so the vineyard of the Lord is
[1:05:24] Israel like we read in our open
[1:05:25] scripture but we are fully aware that
[1:05:28] the Gentiles have been grafted into the
[1:05:31] original Olive Tree which is Christ turn
[1:05:35] with me in your Bibles to the Book of
[1:05:37] Romans chapter
[1:05:40] 11 Romans
[1:05:42] 11: 13-
[1:05:45] 2 says for I speak to you Gentiles in as
[1:05:49] much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles
[1:05:52] I magnify mine office if by any means I
[1:05:55] may provoke to emulation them which are
[1:06:00] my flesh I might save some of
[1:06:03] them for if the casting away of them be
[1:06:06] the reconciling of the world what shall
[1:06:09] the receiving of them be but life from
[1:06:12] the dead for if the first fruit be holy
[1:06:15] who is the first fruit is Israel the
[1:06:18] lump is also holy and if the root be
[1:06:21] holy so are the branches and if some of
[1:06:24] the branches be broken off verse 17 and
[1:06:27] thou being a wild Olive Tree are grafted
[1:06:30] in among them and with them partak of
[1:06:33] the root and fatness of the Olive Tree
[1:06:36] boast not against the branches amen but
[1:06:39] if thou boast thou bearest not the root
[1:06:42] but the root thee so in other words
[1:06:45] don't be boasting against the Jews or
[1:06:47] don't be boasting against denominations
[1:06:50] because you don't believe that they're
[1:06:51] not uh h a part of this this this olive
[1:06:55] tree not they've been a branch that has
[1:06:57] been cut off from this uh Olive Tree
[1:07:00] don't boast against them don't say all
[1:07:04] manner of evil against
[1:07:06] them don't let a root of bitterness rise
[1:07:09] in your heart against them because
[1:07:11] brother brandham said this he said I
[1:07:13] called them Ricky and
[1:07:16] rickettes and the Lord came and spoke to
[1:07:18] him and said I still have seed within
[1:07:20] there amen so if we have a a a a root of
[1:07:25] bitter Bess or something in our heart
[1:07:27] just because somebody belongs to a
[1:07:29] denominational Church chances are you'll
[1:07:32] never win them
[1:07:34] over but be salty because ye the salt of
[1:07:38] the earth boast not against the branches
[1:07:40] but if thou boast thou bearest not the
[1:07:42] root but the root thee thou wil say then
[1:07:45] the branches were broken off that I
[1:07:47] might be grafted in well because of
[1:07:49] unbelief they were broken off and thou
[1:07:51] standest by faith be not high minded but
[1:07:55] fear amen for if God spared not the
[1:07:58] natural branches take heed lest he also
[1:08:02] spare not
[1:08:04] thee so when we read the scripture he's
[1:08:08] telling us don't be highminded within
[1:08:11] yourself don't become a stuffed shirt
[1:08:15] because it's very easily it could happen
[1:08:17] that you could be as one of
[1:08:22] those for if thou were cut out of the
[1:08:25] olve tree which is wilded by nature and
[1:08:27] were grafted contrary to Nature into a
[1:08:30] good Olive Tree how much more shall
[1:08:32] these which be the natural branches be
[1:08:35] grafted into their own olive tree for I
[1:08:37] would not Brethren that ye be ignorant
[1:08:39] of this mystery lest ye should be wise
[1:08:42] in your own
[1:08:44] conceits that blindness in part has
[1:08:47] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[1:08:49] the Gentiles become come in we
[1:08:52] understand that on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:54] the Gentiles were grafted into this good
[1:08:57] Olive Tree because of the rejection of
[1:09:00] the Jews rejecting the Messiah that that
[1:09:04] God had sent them and I like how Paul
[1:09:07] puts this he says uh he he really uh put
[1:09:10] them in their place didn't he he says
[1:09:13] don't be high minded and thinking you're
[1:09:15] someone but rather
[1:09:18] fear it's amazing how quickly it is some
[1:09:21] of us within the message we can turn on
[1:09:24] a person who is struggling within the
[1:09:27] church or within the message it's it's
[1:09:29] amazing how quickly if somebody gets up
[1:09:32] and they leaves that how quickly we turn
[1:09:34] against those
[1:09:37] people as if they're some kind of enemy
[1:09:42] yeah we see them on the road and we
[1:09:44] cross the other
[1:09:47] way you see them and you cuz you don't
[1:09:49] want to talk to them you don't want to
[1:09:50] look at them because they don't go to
[1:09:52] church
[1:09:53] anymore because they don't believe the
[1:09:56] same as what you believe
[1:09:58] anymore how quickly we turn to we turn
[1:10:01] to quotes and scriptures and we say well
[1:10:04] praise God they they they went from us
[1:10:07] because they weren't of us I always knew
[1:10:10] that they were the seed of the serpent I
[1:10:14] always knew that person was never a seed
[1:10:16] of God we get so highminded and lifted
[1:10:20] up in our own pride and within our own
[1:10:23] mind and we become a stub
[1:10:26] shirt Paul says don't be high
[1:10:29] minded but
[1:10:31] fear fear lest the same thing come upon
[1:10:36] you the same struggle comes upon you as
[1:10:39] what Came Upon that person
[1:10:42] amen but we're just so quick to judge
[1:10:45] aren't
[1:10:47] we we're so quick to throw
[1:10:50] stones it's not good for us to throw
[1:10:53] stones when we live in green houses
[1:10:56] why because our house will be smashed up
[1:11:00] to bits in no time amen I have
[1:11:03] learned I have learned
[1:11:06] this and that's Never Say
[1:11:12] Never Never Say Never about anything in
[1:11:15] my own life because chances are that
[1:11:17] never is going to
[1:11:19] happen but also never say never about
[1:11:22] other people never say never that
[1:11:24] someone is too far gone never say that
[1:11:27] someone has passed the line of Grace
[1:11:31] especially if they've kept their mouths
[1:11:33] of the
[1:11:36] message I will say this there are people
[1:11:40] that have left and they have sewn
[1:11:42] Discord and they have got websites and
[1:11:45] they have got podcasts and they have
[1:11:47] done everything that they can do to try
[1:11:49] and tear down and discriminate and to
[1:11:53] absolutely ruin this message
[1:11:57] are they past the line of
[1:12:00] Grace certainly seems like it because
[1:12:04] they don't even want to
[1:12:06] change they don't even want to turn
[1:12:09] back if someone has a little inkling
[1:12:12] within their heart that they want to go
[1:12:15] back to church never doubt that person
[1:12:18] out amen don't leave them out don't
[1:12:20] build a wall between you and them but be
[1:12:23] there when they need it the most
[1:12:26] it doesn't mean that we have to
[1:12:28] sympathize with the sin it doesn't mean
[1:12:31] that we have to Pat him on the back and
[1:12:33] say uh wishy-washy and tell them it's
[1:12:35] going to be okay and just love them no
[1:12:37] we can tell them the truth but don't
[1:12:39] build walls between us and between them
[1:12:42] make sure that they know when it's time
[1:12:44] to come back that you're there with open
[1:12:46] arms and saying welcome back to the
[1:12:49] house of the Lord amen help us Lord yes
[1:12:54] sir help us Lord Lord help us to have
[1:12:58] the right attitude help us Lord to have
[1:13:01] the right
[1:13:02] spirit because if we have the right
[1:13:05] Spirit brother brandham said this he
[1:13:07] said I would rather have a person with
[1:13:08] the right Spirit than the right Doctrine
[1:13:10] because a person with the right spirit
[1:13:12] is teachable
[1:13:14] amen some of you are saying man you
[1:13:17] don't know my family
[1:13:19] members and you're right I don't but you
[1:13:23] know what those family members are
[1:13:24] teaching you
[1:13:26] patience you know what those family
[1:13:28] members are teaching you
[1:13:30] longsuffering you know what those family
[1:13:31] members are teaching you
[1:13:33] gentleness huh shall we go on through
[1:13:35] the seven steps of the Statue of a
[1:13:37] perfect man there's just some family
[1:13:40] members are very good at bringing those
[1:13:42] things out of us in our lives whether we
[1:13:45] like it or
[1:13:47] not but don't cast them out
[1:13:52] amen I say father help us
[1:13:56] now we understand that there's been many
[1:13:58] grafted in vines into this good olive
[1:14:00] tree that have been grafted in by man
[1:14:04] and not by God they're called Baptists
[1:14:07] they're called Pentecostals whatever
[1:14:10] denominational name you want to give
[1:14:11] them that've been grafted in by the by
[1:14:14] by by the leadership of man rather than
[1:14:19] the leadership of God and what does God
[1:14:22] do whenever they're drafted in and and
[1:14:24] they become a grafted in and they become
[1:14:26] a an organization he as a good
[1:14:29] husbandman he he looks at the tree and
[1:14:32] he looks at the fruit that's upon the
[1:14:33] tree and he says Ah that's the wrong
[1:14:35] kind of fruit that's growing upon this
[1:14:37] tree therefore I'm going to prune it I'm
[1:14:40] going to purge it I'm going to cut it
[1:14:43] off I'm going to take it off of this
[1:14:45] tree because it's living off of the
[1:14:47] original life but it's producing the
[1:14:49] wrong kind of
[1:14:52] fruit there's been many branches that's
[1:14:54] been grafted in to what we call the
[1:14:57] message of the
[1:14:58] hour and you say brother Stephen how do
[1:15:01] we know how do we how do we know if it's
[1:15:04] been grafted in by man and and and
[1:15:06] everything look at the fruits that the
[1:15:08] word produces give them the word cast
[1:15:12] and if it's not according to the word
[1:15:15] it's a grafted in man-made
[1:15:20] denomination
[1:15:23] Hallelujah and what does God do with it
[1:15:26] it doesn't belong there why because it's
[1:15:29] been taken over like brother Ron's been
[1:15:31] preaching about by the leadership of
[1:15:34] Man by man's
[1:15:37] intellects by the understanding of man
[1:15:41] well he said this but I believe he meant
[1:15:45] this this is what he told me in
[1:15:49] person and before you know it we have
[1:15:51] all these grafted in branches living off
[1:15:55] of the original life I say father give
[1:15:58] us understanding give us discernment to
[1:16:01] be able to discern what is the word and
[1:16:04] what's not the
[1:16:12] word
[1:16:15] hallelujah that's why this this this
[1:16:18] this Vision that brother brandham had of
[1:16:21] uh of of when he crossed the the the
[1:16:24] curtain of time it's so very important
[1:16:27] to us as as Believers because uh we
[1:16:30] realize this that the original church
[1:16:34] and the church at the end time is going
[1:16:36] to be saying the exact same thing the
[1:16:40] seed that that was first planted in in
[1:16:43] Ephesus is the same seed that comes
[1:16:46] forth in leoa and so we understand that
[1:16:51] uh what was in the beginning the Alpha
[1:16:53] and the Omega will unite and it'll be
[1:16:56] the same word it won't be a different
[1:16:58] word and so whenever we uh uh whenever
[1:17:02] we see of this hear of this vision of
[1:17:04] brother brandham and he's talking about
[1:17:07] um going past the curtain of time and
[1:17:09] and he says my all those people over
[1:17:11] there and the angel talks to him and
[1:17:13] says uh uh you're going to be judged
[1:17:15] according to the word that you've
[1:17:17] preached and he said well is Paul going
[1:17:19] to be judged according to what he
[1:17:21] preached and the angel says yes he'll be
[1:17:24] judged and brother Bram says well praise
[1:17:26] God because I preach the exact same word
[1:17:30] the exact same message of what Paul
[1:17:32] preached it's the same word as it was in
[1:17:36] Ephesus as it is here
[1:17:39] today it is the same word that that
[1:17:42] would began at Pentecost will be saying
[1:17:45] the same thing in this day there will
[1:17:48] not be any deviations of it
[1:17:52] right but the true bride of Christ
[1:17:55] we'll be saying what brother brandham
[1:17:57] said and they'll be saying what the
[1:17:59] Bible says of what the Apostle Paul
[1:18:05] said so we see that uh not only are you
[1:18:11] a a a part of the vineyard in type
[1:18:15] because we realize there was this
[1:18:17] Vineyard and he's talking about Israel
[1:18:19] being the vineyard but also that we are
[1:18:21] a part of this Vineyard we've been
[1:18:23] grafted into this Vineyard
[1:18:25] not also are you a a a a a tree but
[1:18:29] you're also a husbandman or a laborer in
[1:18:32] the vineyard of the
[1:18:35] Lord and we realize that this this life
[1:18:40] of or this process of making uh making
[1:18:45] wine it represents the life of the
[1:18:49] believer so not only are you a a
[1:18:53] Vineyard and are you you've been planted
[1:18:55] as a Vineyard and you're going to bring
[1:18:57] forth fruit but also you are a
[1:18:59] husbandman you're a a laborer in the
[1:19:01] vineyard of the Lord and and a laborer
[1:19:04] has something to do within the vineyard
[1:19:06] a husbandman has a has a work that he
[1:19:09] must do and taking care of the vineyard
[1:19:12] of the
[1:19:13] Lord it is up to the
[1:19:16] husbandman to take care of his
[1:19:20] Vineyard so in other words it is up to
[1:19:23] you to take care care of your
[1:19:27] Vineyard because you are a part of a
[1:19:30] Vineyard your body is a Vineyard it is
[1:19:32] bringing forth fruit and so as a laborer
[1:19:36] in your own Vineyard so to speak it is
[1:19:39] up to you to to labor and to take care
[1:19:43] of this Vineyard or of this
[1:19:46] vessel proverbs 24: 30 through 34 I went
[1:19:52] by the field of the slothful and by the
[1:19:54] vineyard of the man void of
[1:19:57] understanding and lo it was all grown
[1:19:59] over with thorns and Nettles had covered
[1:20:01] the face thereof and the stone wall
[1:20:04] thereof was broken down then I saw and
[1:20:07] considered it well I looked upon it and
[1:20:11] received instruction yet a little
[1:20:13] Slumber a little sleep a little Slumber
[1:20:16] a little folding of the hands to sleep
[1:20:18] so shall they poverty come as one that
[1:20:20] travelleth and they want as an armed man
[1:20:25] every one of us have a Vineyard in our
[1:20:27] lives that we must take care of we
[1:20:29] actually have two Vineyards we have a
[1:20:32] spiritual Vineyard and we have a natural
[1:20:35] Vineyard and the spiritual Vineyard I
[1:20:38] put it as number one because natural
[1:20:40] things come second now the job of the
[1:20:44] the husband men is to do this is to make
[1:20:46] sure that the The Vineyard is properly
[1:20:49] taken care of by maintaining the soil
[1:20:52] taking debris and loose twigs and and
[1:20:54] leaves away from the bottom of the tree
[1:20:57] the most important job of a husbandman
[1:20:59] and a Vineyard is pruning the trees it's
[1:21:04] taking care of the tree it's taking care
[1:21:06] of the debris and the leaves and the
[1:21:09] stuff that that that the wind and the
[1:21:11] conditions of this world would would
[1:21:13] blow against the tree to prevent it from
[1:21:15] reaching its full potential it's the
[1:21:17] husbands man's job to go and to dig
[1:21:20] around it and to water it and and if
[1:21:22] there's a a branch that doesn't belong
[1:21:24] there or a certain something that comes
[1:21:27] up in one of the branches it's up to the
[1:21:29] husband been now to look at the branch
[1:21:32] and to look at the the vine and to say
[1:21:34] this doesn't belong
[1:21:37] here if this Branch continues growing
[1:21:41] it's going to ruin the rest of the crop
[1:21:44] so I must cut it I the the husbandman
[1:21:47] has to spay has to uh spend special
[1:21:52] attention to his Vine
[1:21:55] and to his trees that he's in charge
[1:21:58] of because one thing that's very natural
[1:22:01] for a um for a Vine and for a for a a a
[1:22:06] grape tree per se is that it grows wild
[1:22:11] extremely quickly amen it gets out of
[1:22:15] hand real quick and so there's all kinds
[1:22:18] of branches and all kinds of things that
[1:22:20] begin to grow and if if those things
[1:22:22] aren't taken care of it's going to
[1:22:23] Hinder the growth and the production of
[1:22:27] the fruit at the Harvest Time
[1:22:31] right understand that everything that
[1:22:33] the husbandman does to the tree is for
[1:22:37] its own
[1:22:40] good you think people think well why uh
[1:22:43] why would you just cut that Branch off
[1:22:45] and why would you do this and and and
[1:22:48] and why would you do that because it's
[1:22:49] for the betterment of the tree some
[1:22:52] people think well why does the preacher
[1:22:55] why is he preaching so harshly why is he
[1:22:57] speaking so harshly because he's a
[1:23:00] husbandman and he has a vision of the
[1:23:02] tree and he wants it to bring forth much
[1:23:05] fruit and when the husbandman gets under
[1:23:08] the inspiration of God God's one purpose
[1:23:11] that he wants out of your life is this
[1:23:13] is that you might produce fruit and he
[1:23:16] does what he has to do in our lives in
[1:23:19] order for us to bring forth a h
[1:23:21] hundredfold within our lives thank you
[1:23:24] Lord
[1:23:26] there might be times in our lives and
[1:23:28] circumstances happen that we don't
[1:23:31] like it's
[1:23:33] uncomfortable it hurts for a period of
[1:23:36] time but understand when God is pruning
[1:23:39] our tree it's for our own betterment
[1:23:42] because he wants us to grow in the right
[1:23:44] shape in the right way and to bring
[1:23:47] forth much
[1:23:50] fruit like I already said Vines
[1:23:52] naturally grow in a disorder orderly
[1:23:54] fashion and it needs to be pruned to
[1:23:57] help its structure to control its growth
[1:24:00] and ensure the production of quality
[1:24:04] fruit what are we doing here tonight
[1:24:06] we're being
[1:24:08] pruned God is taking things in our lives
[1:24:11] and he's saying this don't belong here
[1:24:13] and he's snipping it off he's taking
[1:24:15] things over here and he's cutting it off
[1:24:17] and and sometimes it can be very harsh
[1:24:20] but sometimes harshness is needed amen
[1:24:25] it seems
[1:24:28] uncomfortable it's it it it it
[1:24:31] hurts it's not easy for the Lord to
[1:24:34] speak to our hearts about Sin in our
[1:24:36] lives but let me say this it's worth it
[1:24:40] let me say this if God convicts you of
[1:24:42] sin in your life God loves you if your
[1:24:46] friend tells you truth in your life it's
[1:24:48] because he loves you if your mom and dad
[1:24:50] tell you truth it's because they love
[1:24:52] you
[1:24:57] Hallelujah Proverbs 29:15 says the rod
[1:25:00] and reproof give wisdom but a Child Left
[1:25:03] to himself bringeth his mother to shame
[1:25:07] it is natural for us to grow disorderly
[1:25:10] even as adults and so we need to be
[1:25:13] pruned by the word of
[1:25:17] God the printing process is the most
[1:25:20] important part of having a Vineyard if
[1:25:23] you want to have a great Vine find the
[1:25:25] work in the field is what makes the end
[1:25:28] product it's the work behind the scenes
[1:25:32] it's the work leading up to the Harvest
[1:25:35] is what produces the right kind of fruit
[1:25:38] but we read in our scripture there and
[1:25:40] it said uh and it said here's a man void
[1:25:44] of understanding
[1:25:46] void talking about his fig chucking
[1:25:49] about his Vineyard and lo it was all
[1:25:51] grown over with thorns and Nettles had
[1:25:53] it covered the face of it the stone wall
[1:25:55] thereof was broken down what did he
[1:25:57] learn from it the man himself wasn't
[1:26:01] working in his own Vineyard because
[1:26:04] there are times where the preaching of
[1:26:06] the word will go forth and God will
[1:26:09] speak to our hearts and and and and the
[1:26:12] Lord of harvest the the great husbandman
[1:26:15] will come and he'll prune branches off
[1:26:17] of our lives and and he'll come and
[1:26:19] he'll shave us down a little bit and
[1:26:21] he'll work something in our lives but
[1:26:23] there's other times s that God expects
[1:26:25] you as a husbandman over your own life
[1:26:29] to prune your own
[1:26:33] tree there's things in our lives that
[1:26:36] God will not take away from us but he
[1:26:39] says you are a husbandman of the
[1:26:42] vineyard you need to work on your own
[1:26:45] Vine am you need to take the Cutters and
[1:26:49] you need to go to pruning the things
[1:26:52] that I am not going to take from you you
[1:26:54] but you need to give to me
[1:27:01] yourself brother brandham says this in
[1:27:03] the Statue of a perfect man you remember
[1:27:05] the bride tree you remember the sermon
[1:27:07] on the bride tree they eat it down he he
[1:27:09] pruned it they got denominational
[1:27:11] branches he pruned them off they raised
[1:27:13] up in another church denominational
[1:27:14] branches he pruned it off but the heart
[1:27:16] of that tree kept growing and in and in
[1:27:19] the evening time it shall be light see
[1:27:21] that's when when comes Christ the Holy
[1:27:25] Spirit Jesus comes down and sets himself
[1:27:27] at the head of the church then and he
[1:27:29] will resurrect this church being his own
[1:27:32] body in there is the body and the way
[1:27:35] God is expecting us as an individual to
[1:27:38] grow the way he has brought his church
[1:27:41] in to grow every Church age it becomes
[1:27:45] one big church
[1:27:47] see so he says there the way God is
[1:27:52] expecting us as an individual to grow is
[1:27:55] the way he has brought his church in to
[1:27:59] grow so what does God do to
[1:28:02] us he prunes
[1:28:05] us there's things arise in our lives
[1:28:08] from when we're little bitty kids until
[1:28:10] we're we're aged
[1:28:13] adults and as it arises he comes and the
[1:28:16] word Goes Forth and he prunes it and the
[1:28:18] word Goes Forth and he prunes it and
[1:28:20] then finally he gets to a place and he
[1:28:22] says no this certain instance in your
[1:28:25] life this thing that you've been dealing
[1:28:27] with with all these years I'm not going
[1:28:29] to take it away from you you need to
[1:28:31] give it to
[1:28:33] me as the musicians come tonight I bring
[1:28:37] this to a
[1:28:40] close I wonder what it is in our
[1:28:45] lives
[1:28:47] that that God is expecting you to
[1:28:51] prune as the m Master Vineyard of your
[1:28:55] the master the husbandman of your own
[1:29:00] Vineyard I wonder what it is in our
[1:29:03] lives that that holds us back from God I
[1:29:08] wonder what it is that trips us up so
[1:29:11] often and we can speak from both y to
[1:29:14] both young people middle-aged people and
[1:29:16] old people alike because guess what like
[1:29:19] brother Steve coffee says we're people
[1:29:22] we got people problems
[1:29:26] amen but there's certain things my
[1:29:29] brother and my sister and I don't need
[1:29:31] to go through a list but there's certain
[1:29:33] things in our life that you know that
[1:29:35] hey this has been a branch that's been
[1:29:38] veering off for a very long
[1:29:41] time and and it's really beginning to
[1:29:45] grow other
[1:29:46] branches and I've ignored it for years
[1:29:49] and and I thought it it it really
[1:29:51] doesn't affect me but it's affecting me
[1:29:54] it's affecting my spiritual growth it's
[1:29:56] it's affecting the fruit upon my tree
[1:29:59] and I know that if I I just don't want
[1:30:02] to go on like this any longer in dealing
[1:30:05] with this same
[1:30:07] issue the same issue within my flesh
[1:30:11] this issue within my mind this issue
[1:30:13] within my
[1:30:16] heart there's certain things that God
[1:30:19] isn't going to prune off of your
[1:30:21] tree but he wants you to do the
[1:30:25] pruning thank you he wants you to take a
[1:30:29] look inside your own heart and
[1:30:31] say this is really holding me back it's
[1:30:35] really affecting me oh sure we can come
[1:30:38] up with all kind of excuses and we can
[1:30:40] say well it's because of this and
[1:30:42] because of that and you know H I'll use
[1:30:45] an excuse I was an only
[1:30:49] child I was an only child as a kid so
[1:30:52] therefore it's it's just natur natural
[1:30:54] for me to be how I am it's natural for
[1:30:58] me to uh to be
[1:31:01] selfish
[1:31:04] selfish sometimes I'll come home early
[1:31:07] or whatever and don't tell the wife and
[1:31:10] where I could have went and got the kids
[1:31:12] from school cuz I just want to get home
[1:31:16] selfish selfish so I called Ashlin the
[1:31:19] other day said babe I'm on my way home
[1:31:23] I'm calling cuz I can pick up the
[1:31:25] kids say I'm selfish I'm not being
[1:31:28] selfish
[1:31:31] today cuz I'm an only child no CU you
[1:31:35] can be selfish sometimes that's why amen
[1:31:37] what is it it's a branch doesn't belong
[1:31:40] there it's got to be
[1:31:42] pruned so now I make a I make a a
[1:31:47] decision an act of decision that if I'm
[1:31:51] thinking about myself sometimes and
[1:31:52] going home or whatever no no I'm want to
[1:31:56] think about my wife I'm going to think
[1:31:58] how can I betterment her how can I do
[1:32:01] something that's going to help
[1:32:03] her not be so selfish what are
[1:32:08] you no doubt there's no selfish people
[1:32:11] [Music]
[1:32:13] here but what is it in your
[1:32:15] life we all got
[1:32:18] something we all got something in here
[1:32:21] not everything manifests itself
[1:32:23] outwardly right but if you got an
[1:32:25] outwardly thing that you're struggling
[1:32:27] with tonight's your night to prune it
[1:32:29] off tonight's your night to take the saw
[1:32:32] and to take the little uh little Cutters
[1:32:35] there and go to cutting on that thing
[1:32:38] and saying you know what I've dealt with
[1:32:40] this for long enough I'm sick and tired
[1:32:42] of it and I'm going to cut it off and
[1:32:45] I'm going to take it and I'm going to
[1:32:47] I'm going to lay it at the feet of the
[1:32:49] Lord and he can do what he wants with it
[1:32:52] he can bundle it and he can burn it
[1:32:56] but most of us it's all inward
[1:33:00] stuff what's your thing what's your
[1:33:02] stick what's your
[1:33:05] branch that's hindering your walk with
[1:33:08] your
[1:33:09] wife that's hindering your walk with
[1:33:11] your husband what's your branch that's
[1:33:14] hindering your walk with your mom and
[1:33:18] dad what is it that just keeps getting
[1:33:20] in the way that you know you need to
[1:33:22] take care of
[1:33:24] tonight in your own way is is your night
[1:33:28] to think about it and to be honest with
[1:33:32] yourself and to say Here I Am
[1:33:36] Lord in very my
[1:33:39] vulnerabilities um here I am you know
[1:33:42] it's really hard to admit when you're
[1:33:48] wrong you know how hard it is to say
[1:33:52] that you can be selfish sometimes
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:56] s but you got to be honest with
[1:33:59] yourself because when you're honest with
[1:34:01] yourself you realize there's something
[1:34:03] here and I need to deal with
[1:34:06] it so here I
[1:34:08] go let's stand
[1:34:11] [Music]

[1:34:15] tree think about
[1:34:18] it be honest with
[1:34:20] yourself say yeah here's a branch cheer
[1:34:24] and it's been hindering me my whole life
[1:34:26] it's been stunting my growth I I I I
[1:34:29] haven't been bringing I haven't been
[1:34:31] bringing forth fruit like I should be
[1:34:34] bringing forth and I know it and I know
[1:34:36] it's because of this and well if you
[1:34:38] know it and you know it tonight you know
[1:34:40] that you need to take care of it let's
[1:34:43] pray together
[1:34:44] father a very simple sermon and perhaps
[1:34:49] Parts Lord I tripped over my words and
[1:34:53] really didn't make any sense Lord but
[1:34:58] father I believe that there's a reason
[1:35:01] that you that you put this on my heart
[1:35:03] and that it went in this
[1:35:06] direction and so Lord I'm just trusting
[1:35:09] in you and I'm trusting in the gift and
[1:35:12] Lord I'm trusting that this sermon will
[1:35:14] bring forth fruit Lord help us father
[1:35:19] God
[1:35:19] that Lord that we would pay attention to
[1:35:23] our tree as good husband men that we
[1:35:26] would go and Lord very gently and delic
[1:35:32] delicately
[1:35:33] Lord go to cutting off branches that
[1:35:36] don't belong there because father you
[1:35:38] know I I read today Lord that it said
[1:35:41] you just can't uh hack and cut at a at a
[1:35:45] at a at a Vine and at a and at a grape
[1:35:48] tree but it's got to be done the right
[1:35:50] way otherwise you'll damage the tree
[1:35:54] and the healing process would could take
[1:35:56] years and affect the outcome of the tree
[1:36:01] so father may you help us to be kind of
