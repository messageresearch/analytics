[44:29] again we welcome all our visitors this
[44:33] morning especially the presence of our
[44:35] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so uh turn
[44:40] with me in the book of Zechariah so I
[44:42] have two portion of scripture that we'll
[44:44] be reading this morning Zechariah
[44:48] 4:7 and John 1 verse
[44:53] 14-6 just a very simple thought this
[44:57] this morning I know that you heard uh
[44:59] already about this the Covenant of Grace
[45:02] that's why I titled my sermon this
[45:04] morning remembering God's unconditional
[45:07] Covenant of Grace amen
[45:09] amen it's always good to be reminded yes
[45:14] uh along the way in this journey
[45:17] sometimes we have so many trouble along
[45:20] the way we have so many issues and so we
[45:23] need to be it's good to be
[45:25] reminded of the grace of God in our
[45:28] lives Zechariah 4:7 it says who art
[45:34] thou oh great
[45:36] Mountain before
[45:38] zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and
[45:41] he shall bring forth The Headstone the
[45:44] of with shouting crying Grace Grace unto
[45:49] it and turn with me in the Book of John
[45:52] 1 verse4
[46:01] and the word of the Lord was made
[46:04] flesh that mean it's made
[46:07] manifest and dwelt among us and we
[46:11] beheld his glory the glory as the only
[46:14] begotten of the father full of grace and
[46:17] truth I JN bear witness of him and cried
[46:22] saying this was he of whom I spake he
[46:26] that that cometh after me is preferred
[46:29] before me for he was before me and of
[46:33] his fullness have all we receive
[46:37] Grace and uh and Grace for grace in
[46:42] other words we receive Grace upon Grace
[46:45] double portion of Grace we already
[46:48] receive a Grace but we need a double
[46:50] portion of Grace Grace for the changing
[46:53] of our bodies and Grace for rupturing
[46:56] Faith yes amen amen you may be seated
[46:58] God bless
[47:00] you amen so praise the
[47:04] Lord uh just help me
[47:09] pull sometime every time I stand at the
[47:12] pulpit they always say oh you've already
[47:15] been preaching for how many where you
[47:17] still so nervous when you stand in the
[47:20] Pulpit so I always uh thought in my mind
[47:23] that I'm not preaching to any Ordinary
[47:25] People wow
[47:27] I am not we are not preaching just to
[47:29] entertain or just make somebody laugh or
[47:32] we are preaching on the Bride of Jesus
[47:34] Christ and the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[47:37] so
[47:38] choosy you know what I
[47:41] mean we are always on the
[47:44] diet so we want something that will help
[47:47] uh we are in the
[47:49] natural we want to something uh to eat
[47:52] some physical that we can have strength
[47:54] so in the spiritual in the same way so
[47:57] we are on the diet for the spiritual
[48:00] food in Du
[48:01] season always uh it's very hard to seek
[48:05] the mind of God but it's always good
[48:08] that if you can help me this
[48:11] morning because I always say that we are
[48:14] just a delivery boy if you don't order I
[48:18] will not
[48:20] deliver so right that's right but if you
[48:23] if I can feel the pool so praise the
[48:26] Lord that will be God himself that will
[48:28] be speaking to us this morning so in the
[48:32] word of zerubabel or Zariah he said that
[48:36] who art thou oh great Mountain before
[48:38] zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and
[48:41] he shall bring forth The Headstone
[48:43] thereof with shouting crying grace and
[48:46] grace and we know that zerubabel was a
[48:49] was the instrument in which the uh the
[48:52] temple in Babylon will be
[48:54] restored so he saw lot of obstacle while
[48:58] they are restoring the temple they saw a
[49:00] lot of obstacle along the way there's
[49:03] persecution a lot of things and he saw
[49:06] it just like a
[49:07] mountain but he said who art thou a
[49:10] great
[49:12] Mountain you see when we are in the Lord
[49:14] no M no mountain can withstand in the
[49:17] presence of the Lord because it is by
[49:20] God's grace alone that they finish the
[49:22] work of God Amen so we know that uh we
[49:26] the seventh Church AG the first church
[49:28] age start with Grace and now we end up
[49:30] with a double Grace in our generation
[49:33] not only Grace that we are saved by
[49:35] grace but Grace to create a rapturing
[49:38] faith in our heart and Grace for the
[49:41] changing of our
[49:43] body amen so we have a message that will
[49:47] create a rupturing faith in our heart
[49:50] amen so it's not just a a a story in the
[49:55] book that we will be changing a moment
[49:57] in the thinking of an ey but this is a
[50:00] reality because it creates a faith in
[50:03] our heart amen so The Headstone is what
[50:06] CS the pyramid we know
[50:09] that and the entire seven Church age of
[50:12] the body of theber who under the messes
[50:14] have believed and manifested the word
[50:17] for their day yes so this cstone is
[50:20] Christ in the form of the people and of
[50:24] the seven church with the revelations of
[50:26] the fullness of the word of God and we
[50:29] have already received the portion of
[50:32] that word just like
[50:35] Mary uh received the word when the angel
[50:39] of the Lord come before
[50:42] her in Luke 1 verse3 he said and the
[50:46] angel said unto her and we know that we
[50:49] have Angel also in our generation
[50:51] Revelation 10:1 the mighty angel coming
[50:53] down and he said fear not Mary
[50:57] it was directly addressed to Mary which
[50:59] is type of the church in this last days
[51:01] for thou H has found favor with God and
[51:04] the mighty angel that comes down in our
[51:06] generation speak directly to us and we
[51:09] found favor in the eye of God Amen and
[51:12] favor is actually means the word Grace
[51:14] we found Grace yes in the message of the
[51:17] hour amen so as the student of the
[51:19] message we
[51:21] have we know that the full mystery of
[51:24] justification was not fully revealed in
[51:27] Luther's day that's right but in our day
[51:31] the full revelation of justification was
[51:33] revealed by the seventh angel this that
[51:35] place and
[51:37] justifications uh means that not only we
[51:39] are forgiven of our
[51:41] sin but they forget our sin as if we
[51:45] never done it in the first place right
[51:48] and in the first place is in the mind of
[51:50] God amen amen and we are justified in
[51:53] the mind of God and never did it in the
[51:56] first first place and that means there's
[51:58] the grace of God in our life yes amen
[52:00] that's right so in the message Jehovah
[52:04] Gyra uh brother Branham explains about
[52:08] the three Covenant of of
[52:11] God J Jehovah Gyra paragraph 39 now
[52:15] there had been two covenants and one of
[52:17] them was Adam
[52:19] Covenant so the first man was Adam and
[52:22] when God created Adam in the image of
[52:24] God and he he was made flesh Le God gave
[52:27] him all the commission you can eat
[52:29] everything that you see except for the
[52:31] tree of knowledge of good evil because
[52:34] the day e of the day you die so there
[52:36] was a covenant and an agreement and if
[52:38] you will do what I said I will do
[52:41] it God made a covenant with a man if you
[52:44] will I will and he broke
[52:47] it then God made another Covenant with
[52:50] Noah that was Noah's Covenant and it was
[52:54] broke so you see God is
[52:58] so
[52:59] gracious he always extend his
[53:03] grace Adam Covenant and Noah's Covenant
[53:06] both of these men were head over
[53:09] race so that Covenant applies also to
[53:12] their offspring right so now he's making
[53:16] the abrahamic Covenant and the abrahamic
[53:19] Covenant according to Genesis chap 12 so
[53:23] I will read a portion of what brother br
[53:26] CH 12 in Genesis 12:1 he said now the
[53:29] Lord had said unto Abraham the Lord is
[53:35] speaking we don't know how he speak it
[53:39] with a loud voice with Audible Voice but
[53:42] the scripture the Lord
[53:44] speak the same with us we don't know how
[53:46] God spoke it maybe he will use a
[53:48] preacher maybe he will use somebody but
[53:52] God is spok speaking into our heart amen
[53:55] we come into this message of the are by
[53:57] different kind sometime we heard the
[53:59] preacher sometimes somebody shared to us
[54:02] but still it is God in different
[54:05] form God said unto Abraham get thee out
[54:07] of thy country and from thy Kindred and
[54:09] from thy Father's House unto a land that
[54:11] I will sh thee what a great
[54:15] condition so there is always a
[54:17] separation when come to the Lord there
[54:19] is always a
[54:20] separation before the unconditional
[54:22] Covenant take effect there must be a
[54:24] separation first take away from all the
[54:27] unbelief the separation from your
[54:29] Father's Love from the land and he said
[54:31] and I will sh the the
[54:35] land you don't know where you're
[54:38] going but you need to depend on who is
[54:41] speaking to you that's why when God
[54:43] called us we don't know where where our
[54:46] lives will go through in this journey
[54:48] but we sure know that if God called us
[54:51] he will finish
[54:53] it yeah and I will make of thee a great
[54:57] Nation what a
[55:00] statement I will make thee a great
[55:02] nation and I will bless thee and make
[55:05] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[55:09] blessing do you reject that
[55:13] promises wow and I will bless them that
[55:17] bless thee and curse him that curse thee
[55:19] and in the shall all the families of the
[55:21] earth be blessed that's the blessing or
[55:24] that's the Covenant that God made made
[55:26] with Abraham in chapter 12 so we'll
[55:29] continue with the message je Jehovah JRA
[55:32] it was given
[55:36] unconditionally therefore it's Eternal
[55:39] because it's
[55:40] unconditional that condition is still in
[55:43] effect today if we are Abraham's sin
[55:47] right yes not if you will I will he said
[55:51] I have already done it it is already
[55:54] past tense
[55:56] what been through in this life is
[55:58] already been done I have already done it
[56:04] whatever your issue whatever uh things
[56:07] that comes to your way if you are
[56:09] Abraham's SE this unconditional Covenant
[56:12] is still in effect because this
[56:15] unconditional Covenant is eternal
[56:19] Covenant
[56:22] amk Lord yeah I have already done it not
[56:26] I will do
[56:30] it I will do it is just future tense
[56:33] just like you have to have some
[56:35] condition before I will do it but he
[56:37] said I have already done
[56:40] it your salvation is already done your
[56:44] trial is already done whatever things
[56:48] Encounters in your it's already been
[56:50] done you have nothing to do with it just
[56:53] believe what he has already done
[56:57] that's why I titled this remembering the
[56:59] Covenant of Grace in your life because
[57:02] sometimes we forget the grace of God
[57:05] that's right that's right along the way
[57:07] we will just uh oh That's the basis
[57:11] Faith God's determined to save men it
[57:14] was not our
[57:16] determination to be holy to be something
[57:19] it was God's
[57:23] determination that's why you always SP
[57:25] even even if you want to go outside and
[57:28] run away from God if you are a seed of
[57:30] God God is determined to bring you back
[57:32] into his
[57:34] fold that's why it give us a spiritual
[57:37] rest knowing that God is determined when
[57:41] he called us he didn't called us by
[57:44] accident he called
[57:47] us sometimes it's so before the
[57:50] foundation of the word and sometimes we
[57:53] use that word as if in derogatory oh for
[57:57] no that is the real message of the hour
[58:00] that we will know where we came from so
[58:03] that we can conduct ourself in this last
[58:06] days just like the just like the story
[58:08] of brother Braham there was a a a black
[58:12] slave that he he he his action is
[58:15] something different from the ordinary
[58:19] slave so that's
[58:23] why somebody noticed that he was
[58:26] different yes from the rest of the slave
[58:31] and the buyer of the slave asked is he
[58:34] uh something or which
[58:37] no and the slave owner even said that I
[58:40] wondered myself until I realized and I
[58:43] know that he was a prince in the
[58:47] tribe because he knows who he was he act
[58:51] like a prince because he was a prince so
[58:56] that's why he act
[58:58] accordingly because he know who he was
[59:02] just like if we don't know who we are
[59:04] how do we act as the Sons and Daughters
[59:06] of God right that's why the message of
[59:09] the hour is being restored back and we
[59:11] need to have the mind of God and what is
[59:13] the mind of God the word of God in these
[59:15] last days since Jesus Christ is the word
[59:18] of God made manifest and he has the mind
[59:20] of God in him he act according to the
[59:23] Revelation you receed the works that I
[59:25] do is not mine but it was the father in
[59:27] me doing the work expressing the work so
[59:30] if we know who we are then our action
[59:32] will Express God
[59:35] himself yes very good we don't
[59:38] manufacture anything we just believe the
[59:41] word and the word is a seed will just
[59:43] Quicken and manifest itself because if
[59:46] you are the seed of God there is a power
[59:48] in transformation within the
[59:50] seed all the roots all the barks all the
[59:53] fruit all the LI was already in that
[59:55] seed but it take a son which is the
[59:58] spoken word in these last days to
[1:00:00] Quicken the seed and manifest what
[1:00:03] in because if you are a Sin Son of God
[1:00:05] you will manifest the word of God in
[1:00:07] your
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:10] life
[1:00:12] amen God's determined to save men thank
[1:00:17] you
[1:00:18] Lorden that's why we are here because he
[1:00:21] was
[1:00:24] determined he make a Covenant if you
[1:00:27] will I will he break it and another one
[1:00:30] you will I will he broke it man can keep
[1:00:33] his
[1:00:35] Covenant that is why as a
[1:00:38] human we might try to make a covenant
[1:00:41] with God they like Lord I will do this I
[1:00:44] will try my best to be
[1:00:47] good to please God that's the human
[1:00:52] natural side of if we know God we need
[1:00:55] to
[1:00:56] sometimes we try our heart to be
[1:00:58] pleasing to
[1:01:00] God but then you will find that
[1:01:02] somewhere around the
[1:01:03] road you will break that Covenant yes
[1:01:07] because no matter how hard you try
[1:01:10] right at least we
[1:01:14] try and sometime we try hard to please
[1:01:17] God but man can simply keep his side of
[1:01:20] the contract with God right because this
[1:01:24] fles
[1:01:26] right has a nature in itself that it
[1:01:29] would not always please God that's true
[1:01:31] that's why there is a change of body
[1:01:33] because flesh and blood cannot enter
[1:01:35] into the kingdom of God that's why God
[1:01:36] will change this body Allelujah because
[1:01:39] this body will never subject to the word
[1:01:42] of God true so we have a hard time the
[1:01:44] greatest enemy is this body yes he has a
[1:01:47] nature in
[1:01:48] it so Adam and Noah have already proven
[1:01:52] that they try hard but they cannot make
[1:01:54] it and then sometimes when a person
[1:01:56] fails God they might even think that
[1:01:58] they're lost of their
[1:02:01] salvation so we try to fail we try to
[1:02:05] work hard our way on the Lord and
[1:02:07] sometimes we fa not only sometimes but
[1:02:09] most of the times we fail right and
[1:02:12] sometimes we oh I maybe I'm not a son or
[1:02:15] maybe I'm not a daughter I commit
[1:02:19] mistake the problem is that in your mind
[1:02:22] you are subconsciously thinking in the
[1:02:26] terms of wrong Covenant in relationship
[1:02:29] with God
[1:02:31] right your thinking is in the channel of
[1:02:35] work based Covenant like Adam and Noah
[1:02:40] instead of the unconditional Covenant of
[1:02:44] God's grace amen beautiful that's why we
[1:02:47] struggle so much yes because although we
[1:02:51] we receive the grace of God in our life
[1:02:53] but our thinking is still in the channel
[1:02:56] of law making do this and do that and
[1:02:59] sometimes we fail we got discourage
[1:03:02] yes so God saved Men by his grace under
[1:03:06] a covenant that's unconditional Covenant
[1:03:09] oh my never ending that was all of it
[1:03:13] that was all of it it's just so simple
[1:03:15] that was all of
[1:03:17] it
[1:03:19] Noah Adam and Noah Abraham now that's
[1:03:22] the reason we are Abraham's children
[1:03:26] that Covenant cannot be end and will
[1:03:29] never end because it is
[1:03:33] unconditional no condition
[1:03:35] needed God had already done
[1:03:39] it it isn't because you do something on
[1:03:43] is because God did
[1:03:45] something not because you chose God but
[1:03:49] God chose you and he said Do you believe
[1:03:53] it if you believe it then it was imputed
[1:03:56] unto you for righteousness because when
[1:03:59] Abraham believed the promise of God it
[1:04:01] was imputed unto him for his
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:07] righteousness Hallelujah so God made a
[1:04:09] covenant with Abraham and his seed after
[1:04:12] him because the first Covenant with Adam
[1:04:15] was based on condition of the day you
[1:04:19] eat there o the day you die the same
[1:04:23] thing in principle applies to Noah who
[1:04:25] was head of a new race of people after
[1:04:27] the flood so we will notice now that
[1:04:31] Adam's sin resulted in exposure of his
[1:04:35] own
[1:04:36] nakedness so he was afraid to praise God
[1:04:39] because he was
[1:04:41] naked and then also that how Noah has
[1:04:44] seen his getting drunk resulted in
[1:04:47] exposure of his
[1:04:49] nakedness and how that Adam and Eve
[1:04:52] naked had to be covered by God and how
[1:04:55] that no one his wife's naked and had to
[1:04:57] be covered by his two son it's just the
[1:05:00] same pattern
[1:05:02] Y and then we see that Adam's seed
[1:05:06] brought a curse upon his seed because
[1:05:09] Adam is aead of a race so that's why in
[1:05:13] Romans 5:12 it said wherefore as by one
[1:05:15] man sined entered into the world and
[1:05:18] death by sin and so death pass unto all
[1:05:21] men for all have
[1:05:24] sin and then C Came Upon Noah's seed
[1:05:27] also because Canaan was ham seed from
[1:05:30] Noah and in Genesis 9: 24 he said and
[1:05:33] Noah awoke from his wine and knew what
[1:05:36] his younger son had done unto him and he
[1:05:38] said cursed be Canan a servant of
[1:05:41] servant shall be unto his
[1:05:45] Brethren so if you if we study this
[1:05:49] scripture pattern closely you will
[1:05:52] notice that God never intervened
[1:05:55] to stop the union between the serpent
[1:05:58] and Eve taking
[1:06:01] place because they broke the
[1:06:04] Covenant so God didn't intervene even in
[1:06:08] Noah's time although he found Grace in
[1:06:10] the eye of God God didn't
[1:06:15] intervene but when God made an
[1:06:18] unconditional with
[1:06:21] Abraham he went out
[1:06:25] from their country and
[1:06:27] CED separate but he brought with him lot
[1:06:32] yeah that's right it didn't take it a
[1:06:34] lot maybe just maybe God didn't really
[1:06:37] mean to separate from some of us thought
[1:06:41] like
[1:06:42] that maybe God didn't really mean like
[1:06:45] that so when he brought lot with him
[1:06:48] maybe it's okay because it's part of my
[1:06:51] family but the result was it creates a
[1:06:55] out of
[1:06:58] trouble did it take away the promises of
[1:07:03] God no so they went to Canaan which is
[1:07:07] the promised land that God promised and
[1:07:09] God Prosper him but when time come that
[1:07:11] there was
[1:07:14] sing if there is a irresponsible
[1:07:19] husband Abraham was
[1:07:22] one they were in the promised land but
[1:07:25] when famine
[1:07:27] start he was the one who went out from
[1:07:30] the promised land instead of
[1:07:33] bringing his
[1:07:35] family on their knees to pray he went
[1:07:39] out from
[1:07:41] Canaan then they went to
[1:07:45] Egypt and he was afraid so if there is a
[1:07:48] selfish man number one is Abraham tell
[1:07:52] the king tell them if they ask you tell
[1:07:54] them that you are my sister
[1:08:02] in a human point of
[1:08:04] you Abraham was
[1:08:08] irresponsible he is selfish always
[1:08:11] thinking about himself not thinking
[1:08:14] about what will happen to
[1:08:18] Sarah if they ask you tell tell them
[1:08:21] that you are my
[1:08:23] sister what can Sarah do
[1:08:27] but to follow what
[1:08:30] Abraham tell him to do maybe deep down
[1:08:33] in Sarah's heart if given a chance I
[1:08:36] will separate from you you are
[1:08:39] irresponsible you are selfish you are
[1:08:43] nothing maybe he's trying to ready a
[1:08:46] separation divorce
[1:08:51] paper so when they went to Egypt a bab
[1:08:55] like I as Abraham or Sarah or something
[1:08:57] like
[1:08:58] that so
[1:09:01] aik the inity the Integrity he was so
[1:09:05] honest I want to
[1:09:06] marry oh
[1:09:08] Sarah but when God made an unconditional
[1:09:13] Covenant and abik is
[1:09:16] ready to take Sarah as his
[1:09:19] wife because of the unconditional
[1:09:22] Covenant God intervened
[1:09:28] that's it in Adam he didn't intervene in
[1:09:30] Noah's time he didn't intervene but when
[1:09:33] he gave the unconditional Covenant and
[1:09:36] something happened between Sarah and
[1:09:39] aimil God
[1:09:41] interven because he's giving the
[1:09:43] unconditional Covenant I have already
[1:09:46] done and I will bless thee so whatever
[1:09:48] happens in alone his journey God is
[1:09:51] obligated to intervene to keep his
[1:09:54] promise
[1:10:00] in Genesis chapter
[1:10:02] 20 while
[1:10:04] aimik was having a good time tomorrow is
[1:10:08] the
[1:10:10] day because sah was so
[1:10:14] beautiful God meet him and he said now
[1:10:18] therefore restore the man his
[1:10:22] wife if you read it he is reasoning with
[1:10:26] God but he told me that he
[1:10:30] is Abraham was his brother and you know
[1:10:33] the Integrity of My Heart
[1:10:37] Lord he is a prophet God identified
[1:10:41] Abraham as a prophet
[1:10:43] yes now therefore restore the man his
[1:10:46] wife for he is a prophet and he shall
[1:10:47] pray for
[1:10:49] thee the irresponsible men
[1:10:55] and thou shall
[1:10:59] live and if thou restore her
[1:11:03] not know that thou shallal surely die
[1:11:08] and all that are
[1:11:10] dying in other words if you touch that
[1:11:13] woman you are
[1:11:15] dead along the road with your whole
[1:11:20] Kingdom because God is intervening his
[1:11:23] unconditional Covenant with
[1:11:27] Abraham likewise we as a Seed of Abraham
[1:11:31] everything that happens our way praise
[1:11:33] God that will hinder the unconditional
[1:11:37] Covenant of God to bless you he will
[1:11:40] intervene you may have trials issues in
[1:11:43] your life but God is in the scene to
[1:11:48] intervene return this man his
[1:11:51] wife and pray
[1:11:58] God didn't look the responsible
[1:12:01] man God didn't look at his selfishness
[1:12:05] he look at his
[1:12:06] promise because when he promised Abraham
[1:12:09] he doesn't care about Abraham that's
[1:12:12] right he don't care about his past his
[1:12:14] present what God cares is Covenant with
[1:12:19] Abraham and he is keeping his word in
[1:12:22] order to fulfill his Covenant with
[1:12:23] Abraham
[1:12:27] we are the Seed of
[1:12:30] Abraham that everything that comes our
[1:12:33] way God will honor your faith in his
[1:12:39] word your
[1:12:41] prayer is a million
[1:12:44] times higher than the
[1:12:49] angel so this Covenant of Grace with
[1:12:52] Abraham was a very different Covenant of
[1:12:54] that of the first two Covenant of Adam
[1:12:57] and Noah it was New Covenant based
[1:13:00] entirely on God's grace and it has
[1:13:04] nothing to do with Abraham's good living
[1:13:07] that's right
[1:13:10] Amen brother
[1:13:13] Hallelujah so this is also how God deals
[1:13:15] with Abraham's sin because Abraham was
[1:13:19] the head of a faith seed race of people
[1:13:22] that's right and this is why God will
[1:13:24] intervene a certain situation in your
[1:13:26] life
[1:13:29] Supernatural yes sir amen sometimes you
[1:13:32] wonder why this happen why this happen
[1:13:34] why this happen it was God himself
[1:13:37] intervening in whatever situations you
[1:13:39] are
[1:13:41] in which you would otherwise been really
[1:13:43] messed up this is the grace of God
[1:13:45] revealed in your life as it was in
[1:13:48] Abraham's
[1:13:50] life so understand this clearly we know
[1:13:53] that Adam was the head of the race
[1:13:55] that fell by sex and Noah was head of
[1:13:58] the race of a second uh world that was
[1:14:01] also polluted by sex so we can see that
[1:14:03] both of these races came by the flesh by
[1:14:05] the seed of Flesh through the birth of a
[1:14:08] womb of a
[1:14:10] woman but when Abraham was called he was
[1:14:14] called to be the head of a race that was
[1:14:17] not going to come by fleshly seed to the
[1:14:20] womb of a woman but by a faith seed that
[1:14:23] came out of his faith Abraham Abraham's
[1:14:26] SP seed a seed that would not come by
[1:14:28] sex but a seed that would come by the
[1:14:31] revelations of the word of God which is
[1:14:33] Christ in our
[1:14:36] generation so under the first two
[1:14:38] Covenant God was dealing by ways of
[1:14:40] Flesh and un conditions of law but under
[1:14:43] this abrahamic Covenant God now was
[1:14:46] dealing by way of Faith to the revealing
[1:14:49] of his word amen and not by sex and law
[1:14:53] in world but by the revelation of of
[1:14:56] himself so Abraham was the father of
[1:14:59] many nations of his faith seed and the
[1:15:01] revelation of Christ in the hearts of
[1:15:03] the people so under this third and final
[1:15:06] and NeverEnding Covenant of Grace God
[1:15:09] was bringing forth his seed by a faith
[1:15:12] creation and not by sex
[1:15:15] amen this is another Covenant that's
[1:15:18] right not by Flesh and Blood by the
[1:15:20] faith seed Revelation that's why today
[1:15:23] even the Muslim hold on to Abraham they
[1:15:25] claimed that they were Abraham's
[1:15:28] SE some of the denomination hold on to
[1:15:31] Abraham they are consider him the father
[1:15:33] of Faith too and even the Jew they want
[1:15:37] to identify themselves with Abraham but
[1:15:40] yet the real one are the Royal seed of
[1:15:43] the faith of Abraham of the one that
[1:15:45] came and turned his back to the tent and
[1:15:48] opened the mysteries of them that it was
[1:15:50] through identification of Abraham's seed
[1:15:53] in these days God Came Down In the Flesh
[1:15:56] and discerned the hearts which
[1:15:59] is in Sarah which is the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:01] Christ that's the Royal seed it is his
[1:16:05] Royal seed that in this day has seen
[1:16:07] seen the has seen the event take place
[1:16:10] as our father saw it in this day it's
[1:16:13] the same pattern amen God came down made
[1:16:15] himself in the flesh of the person of
[1:16:17] brother Braham and discerned the hearts
[1:16:18] of his children in this last day God
[1:16:20] made flesh once again in this last days
[1:16:23] hallelujah so Muslim cannot claim
[1:16:25] Abraham denomination can claim it the
[1:16:27] you can claim it but you and I the Royal
[1:16:29] Seed of Abraham can claim the promise of
[1:16:32] God hallelujah Ephesians 289 said by
[1:16:36] grace are you saved through faith and
[1:16:40] that not of yourself it is the gift of
[1:16:43] God faith is the gift of God Amen not of
[1:16:47] Works L any man should boast you are
[1:16:49] saved by God's grace that come by the
[1:16:51] revelation of the seed word of your day
[1:16:54] amen and so it is by the grace of God
[1:16:56] Alone that God has revealed himself to
[1:16:58] you by the word of your day that is the
[1:17:01] grace of God the revelation of the word
[1:17:04] of God of what is happening in our day
[1:17:07] being revealed unto you that is the
[1:17:10] grace of God because not everybody can
[1:17:13] receive what you receive not everybody
[1:17:15] can appreciate what God has done in our
[1:17:17] day except you and I as the realy Seed
[1:17:20] of Abraham and that is the grace of God
[1:17:22] praise God by sending us the word being
[1:17:24] reveal in this last day then we can
[1:17:27] identify oursel in this scripture what
[1:17:29] Abraham's blessing was it is to with
[1:17:33] us that's why remember yes the Covenant
[1:17:38] of Grace in your
[1:17:40] life and so it has nothing to do with
[1:17:42] your works of your good behavior no more
[1:17:45] than it was Abraham's
[1:17:46] Works forget the works you will struggle
[1:17:50] by your works just remember the
[1:17:53] unconditional of Grace and our work with
[1:17:57] just in appreciation of what he has done
[1:18:00] in our lives and so we want to reflect
[1:18:03] that grace of God in our lives by our
[1:18:05] desire to live the right sort of life
[1:18:06] that is pleasing to the
[1:18:09] Lord faith is work expressed the
[1:18:13] Revelation that you receive will express
[1:18:15] it in our work not by our own ability
[1:18:20] not by your
[1:18:21] struggle but by your faith
[1:18:25] because the more you eat the word the
[1:18:27] more you become if you eat the word you
[1:18:29] will become the
[1:18:32] word just forget your
[1:18:35] struggle just eat the
[1:18:39] word we are on
[1:18:42] diet to keep us healthy before the
[1:18:46] changing of our body God requires to eat
[1:18:49] the food spiritual food in your season
[1:18:51] God don't require you to work your way
[1:18:53] into salvation
[1:18:55] because it has already
[1:18:57] done you just need to believe it and
[1:18:59] when you believe it will be imputed unto
[1:19:01] you for righteousness because blessed is
[1:19:04] the man that God is not counted that
[1:19:06] don't count sin in your life you are
[1:19:08] already
[1:19:11] Justified and that is the true balance
[1:19:13] of grace of God in your life and if you
[1:19:16] fail at times and we will fail many
[1:19:18] times just like Abraham fails inde did
[1:19:22] in Genesis 20 by giving his way WIP
[1:19:25] away to the prevent to to be prated then
[1:19:28] it was God's gra that intervene a lot of
[1:19:31] times we fail if we say we don't fail
[1:19:35] you are a
[1:19:39] liar let us be realistic we are saved by
[1:19:42] grace but we still we fail we have
[1:19:45] failures we have failed sometimes in our
[1:19:47] life but every time we fail God
[1:19:53] intervene amen amen thank you Lord
[1:19:56] because he want to keep his Covenant
[1:19:59] pure and this unconditional covenant not
[1:20:02] only in the day of Abraham but until
[1:20:04] this day because we are the Royal Seed
[1:20:07] of
[1:20:09] Abraham the invisible Union of bride of
[1:20:12] Christ I believe that we are
[1:20:15] now the wife is already being
[1:20:18] ready and he said you're going to the
[1:20:20] wedding in the sky do you believe
[1:20:22] it not only the wedding but the wedding
[1:20:25] is already taking place but we are
[1:20:27] waiting in the sky for the Lord's
[1:20:30] supper and you are wearing the wedding
[1:20:32] band of predestinated unmerited Grace a
[1:20:36] wedding band of Grace
[1:20:38] unmerited of your own God did it
[1:20:43] himself you don't put the wedding band
[1:20:45] on yourself God did
[1:20:48] it God did it himself he knew you before
[1:20:51] the foundation of the word so he SLI the
[1:20:53] wedding ban on you there and put your
[1:20:55] names on The Book of Life what a
[1:20:57] consolation Hallelujah we just need to
[1:21:00] Rejoice what he has done in our life we
[1:21:02] don't need to struggle day by day but we
[1:21:05] need to praise Him day by day because
[1:21:08] he's worthy of Our
[1:21:10] Praise
[1:21:12] Hallelujah yes
[1:21:15] sir in the
[1:21:17] message of Grace he said think of it
[1:21:21] love and grace is
[1:21:23] sisters TW sisters you can have Grace
[1:21:26] without having
[1:21:28] love they're twin sisters that exactly
[1:21:30] right before you can have Grace you have
[1:21:32] to have
[1:21:34] love this is not just a p Your Love P
[1:21:38] your love is when you love me I will
[1:21:39] love you but if you are against me I
[1:21:42] will kill you that's love but this is
[1:21:45] what we agap love because agap love is
[1:21:48] divine love which
[1:21:50] cover all kinds of sin and there
[1:21:55] understanding but before you can
[1:21:56] actually show somebody a favor you love
[1:22:00] them right or wrong you have to love
[1:22:03] them
[1:22:05] anyhow or you can't so love and grace is
[1:22:08] the same thing they're just twin sisters
[1:22:11] that's all love and grace they you can
[1:22:13] see one without the other wow for God so
[1:22:16] loved the word that he gave his only
[1:22:18] begotten son he shed his grace abroad in
[1:22:21] our hearts through the Holy Ghost
[1:22:23] there's nothing you can do without
[1:22:25] working one with the other Grace Grace
[1:22:27] of God is what save
[1:22:31] us amen that's why there was a
[1:22:34] default for God so loved the word that
[1:22:37] he gave his only begotten son that
[1:22:39] whosoever believeth on him should not
[1:22:41] perish and habit is for
[1:22:44] everybody and children born without
[1:22:47] knowing maybe the grace of God and
[1:22:50] brother Braham said when a baby is born
[1:22:52] and he was he died
[1:22:55] then is still covered by the default the
[1:22:58] blood of Jesus Christ that's
[1:23:02] right John 1:17 for the law was given by
[1:23:06] Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus
[1:23:10] Christ that's why a few Sundays ago we
[1:23:13] speaks about when the spirit of truth
[1:23:15] shall come and the correctness of Truth
[1:23:18] is will set you
[1:23:20] free we would simply not know Grace if
[1:23:23] it hadn't been for law do you agree it
[1:23:26] the law of God was only given to Moses
[1:23:28] in order to show what sin was God never
[1:23:31] intended for us to somehow stand perfect
[1:23:34] before him by obeying an endless numbers
[1:23:36] of rules and
[1:23:39] regulations he knew that it would never
[1:23:41] happen so in the message law or Grace he
[1:23:44] said back in the time that God sent down
[1:23:47] the
[1:23:47] law and was added to show us that these
[1:23:50] things were
[1:23:52] sin but now that Lo couldn't take away
[1:23:55] sin but it magnifies sin right because
[1:23:59] if there's no law says you can't do this
[1:24:02] why it's not it isn't you commit or
[1:24:04] break that you can't break it because
[1:24:07] there's no law to break
[1:24:09] it but when law becomes in effect then
[1:24:13] sin made manifest then they would say
[1:24:16] thou shall not steal thou shall not
[1:24:18] commit adultery thou shall not bear
[1:24:21] false witness and all these things they
[1:24:23] did it before but it couldn't be Recon
[1:24:26] as sin because there's no law against it
[1:24:30] but when law came in it made the man
[1:24:34] realize he can steal he can't lie he
[1:24:37] can't commit adultery and all the
[1:24:39] Commandment just magnifies but
[1:24:42] yet that law didn't take away sin it
[1:24:46] only brought a man to know that it was
[1:24:49] sin when Christ came Christ came to take
[1:24:52] away sin Hallelujah so that's why Christ
[1:24:55] the word of God was made manifest to
[1:24:57] take away
[1:25:00] sin Hallelujah that's why in second
[1:25:02] Peter
[1:25:03] 3:15 it was the Peter writing to the
[1:25:06] church account that the longsuffering of
[1:25:08] Our Lord is
[1:25:10] salvation he is not willing that anyone
[1:25:12] should perish but come unto repentance
[1:25:15] even as our beloved Paul also according
[1:25:17] to the wisdom given unto him had written
[1:25:19] unto you so this wisdom came from above
[1:25:23] it was not wisdom that it was the grace
[1:25:25] of God coming in him Hallelujah and also
[1:25:30] in all his Epistles speaking in them of
[1:25:32] this thing in which some things hard to
[1:25:36] be
[1:25:37] understood some of the revelation of
[1:25:39] Paul is hard to understand he preach
[1:25:43] about
[1:25:46] eternal he preached about predestination
[1:25:49] before the foundation of the world he
[1:25:51] preached about the coming of the Lord
[1:25:53] with a shout with a voice with a
[1:25:55] Archangel yes he speaks about he was
[1:25:58] caught up in third heaven sure sometimes
[1:26:01] hard to
[1:26:02] understand that's why in which are some
[1:26:05] things hard to understand which they are
[1:26:07] not they are unlearned and unstable rest
[1:26:10] as they also do other scripture unto
[1:26:13] their own destruction so this rest in
[1:26:16] the Bible sense it means to twist or to
[1:26:20] turn uh ay to pervert so in other
[1:26:25] words our conception before the grace of
[1:26:29] God come of the Epistle of Paul have
[1:26:32] become like a set of
[1:26:35] law Like rules that actually begin to
[1:26:38] work against you in a destructive way
[1:26:42] instead of causing you to
[1:26:44] know and grow in the knowledge of the
[1:26:47] Lord Jesus
[1:26:49] Christ that is why a person can start to
[1:26:51] become unstable in their Chris Christian
[1:26:54] walk in their concept of thinking that
[1:26:57] it is about laws and
[1:27:01] rules if you don't grow in the grace of
[1:27:04] God then you can start in
[1:27:07] Grace and end up in
[1:27:09] law and begin to see yourself through
[1:27:12] the eye of the law and not through the
[1:27:14] eye of
[1:27:15] Grace and of a finished work of
[1:27:18] Christ you start with Grace and you are
[1:27:21] end with law
[1:27:25] is it happening in the message
[1:27:27] Circle it's become rules and regulation
[1:27:30] that actually it start with Grace in our
[1:27:35] lives so begin to think that is by your
[1:27:38] own good deeds and
[1:27:41] obedient uh set of rules this concept is
[1:27:44] what causes a person to end up in self
[1:27:47] condemn state
[1:27:55] condemn state of mind that is
[1:27:57] destructive to their own faith and to
[1:27:59] others and this is what the children of
[1:28:02] Israel effectively did in the wilderness
[1:28:05] Journey when they took on the
[1:28:08] law instead of
[1:28:10] Grace and that was one of their biggest
[1:28:14] mistake and it can also be our biggest
[1:28:17] mistake they forget about the
[1:28:20] unconditional Covenant of their father
[1:28:23] Abraham
[1:28:24] they turn into law and rules and
[1:28:27] regulations in verse 17 ye therefore Bel
[1:28:31] seeing you know these things before
[1:28:33] beware lest ye also being led away with
[1:28:38] the error of the wicked fall from your
[1:28:41] own
[1:28:42] steadfastness so this steadfastness
[1:28:45] means confirm or a firm condition of
[1:28:49] mind so in other words you can go along
[1:28:51] in your growth as a believer in the
[1:28:54] knowledge of the word of God but you
[1:28:56] fail to grow yeah in the grace of
[1:29:01] God then you can begin to think that it
[1:29:04] is about rules and then you will become
[1:29:07] unstable and steadfast in your faith in
[1:29:09] the fous work of
[1:29:11] Grace because you thought I cannot make
[1:29:13] it I cannot do this I cannot do that you
[1:29:15] forget that there was an unconditional
[1:29:18] Covenant you don't need to do anything
[1:29:20] just believe the word of God and in the
[1:29:22] process of time you will manifest what
[1:29:24] you
[1:29:26] believe yes sir amen and then you will
[1:29:28] become unstable and steadfast in your
[1:29:30] faith in the finished work of Grace and
[1:29:32] that is the Trap that the children of
[1:29:34] Israel fell into they had eaten the
[1:29:38] Passover which was F after we baptized
[1:29:40] in the Red Sea for just justification
[1:29:43] but then they fell away from their
[1:29:45] standing of an unconditional Covenant of
[1:29:48] Grace of God made with the Father
[1:29:51] Abraham that was the final and
[1:29:52] Everlasting Covenant
[1:29:55] there is no other Covenant it ends with
[1:29:58] Abraham the unconditional Covenant and
[1:30:01] there was no better Covenant to come
[1:30:02] after Grace and yet they fell into a
[1:30:04] concept of righteousness by keeping the
[1:30:06] law amen is it happening in our church
[1:30:10] in our in the end time message Circle we
[1:30:14] start from Grace the grace of God we
[1:30:16] don't do but along the way it seems
[1:30:18] there's a band of rules and regulations
[1:30:21] you need to do this you have long hair
[1:30:22] you need to do this you need to do that
[1:30:24] it becomes
[1:30:26] Rule and people are
[1:30:28] afraid and sometimes if they fail they
[1:30:31] thought that they were not
[1:30:35] saved how come they thought that they
[1:30:37] not saved because it comes from the
[1:30:40] pulpit the pulpit is the Throne of God
[1:30:43] and always the grace of God is being
[1:30:45] spoken out of this Pulpit to LIF your
[1:30:48] faith higher it is nothing that you have
[1:30:51] done but he has already done it in the
[1:30:54] first place and we need to appreciate of
[1:30:57] God what he has done in our life that is
[1:30:59] the real grace of God to
[1:31:01] know his purpose in life that's why Paul
[1:31:04] said but grow in Grace we need to grow
[1:31:08] in
[1:31:09] Grace not only we are saved by grace but
[1:31:11] we know we need to grow in the grace and
[1:31:15] the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:17] we need to
[1:31:18] experience our daily walk with
[1:31:22] Christ we may fail and we fail a lot of
[1:31:25] times just like Paul
[1:31:28] did if I want to do
[1:31:31] good something is bothering me come
[1:31:35] on so it's so important to realize the
[1:31:38] full revelation of the mystery of Grace
[1:31:41] that has been fully open to us in this
[1:31:43] age along with our
[1:31:44] growth in the revelations of the word we
[1:31:48] need to grow in Grace
[1:31:55] sometimes it's okay oh I'm predestinated
[1:31:56] I'm do this and but we need to grow to
[1:32:00] appreciate what predestination was we
[1:32:03] need to experience it in our
[1:32:06] life not like the Pentecost said oh we
[1:32:08] know that you are predestinated because
[1:32:10] you go to church every
[1:32:12] day and my example and he gave me an
[1:32:15] example when you're riding a train and
[1:32:16] you fall from the train that means you
[1:32:18] are not predestinated that was their
[1:32:21] understanding that's right right and I
[1:32:23] told him well I want to share the my
[1:32:26] understanding of predestination yeah go
[1:32:28] ahead so if you are riding in a train
[1:32:30] and you fall down God will stop the
[1:32:32] train and put you back in the train
[1:32:34] until you reach your
[1:32:36] destination Hallelujah that is my
[1:32:38] destination because he has already done
[1:32:40] it what he has started in the beginning
[1:32:42] he will end it because he is the author
[1:32:45] and the finishers of our faith it has
[1:32:48] nothing to do with it God will always
[1:32:50] intervene
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:32:51] [Applause]
[1:32:56] Hallelujah so the balance of these two
[1:32:58] Wings Will Keep Us walking in faith and
[1:33:00] in peace and in joy of our Salvation we
[1:33:03] need to balance our
[1:33:05] faith message of Grace but according to
[1:33:08] the prophecy there will come The
[1:33:11] Headstone and I want you to notice that
[1:33:13] when The Headstone come the prince is
[1:33:15] going to cry out the message will cry
[1:33:17] Grace Grace for it's by grace that we
[1:33:20] are saved not of Works lest any man
[1:33:23] should both
[1:33:29] it's all
[1:33:31] Grace if we want to boast we want to
[1:33:34] boast the grace of God in our
[1:33:36] life that's all the things that we
[1:33:39] happen to us I am
[1:33:42] saved and we say I am
[1:33:44] predestinated don't be ashamed that's
[1:33:48] because that is your message of the hour
[1:33:50] that that's why you come this a long way
[1:33:52] in your journey life because you are
[1:33:55] predestinated and if you are
[1:33:57] predestinated your life will follow what
[1:34:00] you
[1:34:01] professed because your destiny is
[1:34:03] already done
[1:34:05] deal that's good you cannot add anything
[1:34:08] to it but to believe what he has already
[1:34:11] done that's why we can see a lot of
[1:34:13] healing among us because they believe
[1:34:17] the word of God amen amen and the
[1:34:20] prophet said healing will soon come that
[1:34:23] it will will be common among us Amen in
[1:34:26] our church there are cancer that they
[1:34:28] being healed everything healed then the
[1:34:30] other Church there are four stages of
[1:34:32] cancer and they were healed by just
[1:34:34] believing the word of God Amen in the
[1:34:36] Church of brother Roman King there was a
[1:34:38] sister was already a four stage cancer
[1:34:41] and he was in a chemotherapy and she
[1:34:43] said that the chemotherapy has no effect
[1:34:45] on my life but I believe the word and
[1:34:47] God Restore for help even his hair was
[1:34:51] restored and someday it will be common
[1:34:54] among the Believers that believe the
[1:34:56] message of are because it's already done
[1:34:58] deal what can you do but to believe and
[1:35:01] if you don't believe ask God that give
[1:35:03] you Faith to believe his word and he
[1:35:06] will manifest his
[1:35:07] word
[1:35:09] amen because that is uncondition that's
[1:35:12] why in some mod do not forget your
[1:35:15] benefit what is your benefit God has
[1:35:18] already done it
[1:35:20] am whatever situation you are in don't
[1:35:23] forget get the
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:27] benefits and the message of Grace has
[1:35:30] Trump under the feet of men until it
[1:35:32] become
[1:35:34] disgrace they say Oh I'm great I I am
[1:35:37] ready eternally sh I can do what I want
[1:35:40] to
[1:35:40] do I can smoke I can drink because I am
[1:35:43] already
[1:35:44] secure they are Trump right they run
[1:35:48] over to that grace of God
[1:35:51] yes but the grace of God is as the
[1:35:55] prophet said oh I am saved and I
[1:35:57] predestined I can do what I want brother
[1:35:58] Braham yes you can yes you can you can
[1:36:02] do whatever you
[1:36:04] want but I guarantee you you will not
[1:36:07] desire to commit sin if you are
[1:36:10] predestinate your desires to align
[1:36:12] yourself in the word of God because it
[1:36:14] is the seed of God that will Quicken
[1:36:16] your heart and it will align in the word
[1:36:19] of God we can say just like Jesus Christ
[1:36:22] the work that I do is not mine
[1:36:24] but it was the word of God being made
[1:36:26] manifest unto
[1:36:31] me remember that he was the first
[1:36:34] born and we are the next to be
[1:36:39] born
[1:36:41] Hallelujah some runs out of it or
[1:36:44] everything but the true message of Grace
[1:36:46] remain the same amen and there's where
[1:36:50] Satan tries to knock it out from the
[1:36:52] church but it's the grace of God that we
[1:36:55] are all
[1:36:58] saved
[1:37:00] amen sometimes it's so common to hear oh
[1:37:03] we are saved we are saved by
[1:37:05] grace it's not
[1:37:08] common
[1:37:10] Supernatural praise God amen hallelujah
[1:37:14] thank you Lord remember that we can
[1:37:16] never Uno the power of grace of God of
[1:37:20] what he has achieved by his Redemptive
[1:37:23] work in our life
[1:37:25] amen but we can at times fail to live a
[1:37:28] life that leades up to that Grace do you
[1:37:31] agree
[1:37:33] yes why are you so
[1:37:38] silent amen but we can at times fail to
[1:37:41] live the life
[1:37:44] yeah so then our life and action will
[1:37:46] bring confusion to others and we'll
[1:37:48] suffer for that in this
[1:37:51] life because somebody is looking
[1:37:54] at our
[1:37:56] life with all the struggle
[1:37:59] with at times of what Paul struggled
[1:38:03] with in that when we want to do good
[1:38:07] evil is present that's true right but
[1:38:10] like Paul we must know that the real
[1:38:11] true grace of God is that he has
[1:38:14] revealed this great mystery of his word
[1:38:16] to us in this
[1:38:18] hour so it's not that we live our life
[1:38:21] trying to follow a set of rules and
[1:38:24] regulations do this have long hair no
[1:38:28] makeup long hair clean
[1:38:31] no it's not about rules and regulations
[1:38:34] it's about the grace of God in our
[1:38:37] lives
[1:38:40] Hallelujah so it's not what we live our
[1:38:44] life by trying to follow a set of brues
[1:38:46] but that we live our lives out of an
[1:38:49] appreciation of the grace of God that's
[1:38:52] show to us amen
[1:38:54] and when we make mistakes our flesh
[1:38:59] fails thank God that we are living in
[1:39:02] the
[1:39:03] reality our flesh
[1:39:05] fails then we must confess our sins to
[1:39:09] God knowing that there is an
[1:39:11] unconditional Covenant of Grace that is
[1:39:14] a million times more yes sufficient than
[1:39:18] all our sin true we fail and sometimes
[1:39:20] we fail but we need to confess if we
[1:39:22] confess yeah our sin before him God is
[1:39:26] faithful to forgive our sins he knows we
[1:39:29] fail we fail and so we have so many
[1:39:32] failures just like Paul he has a turn in
[1:39:34] the flesh but God said my grace is
[1:39:38] sufficient
[1:39:40] for because Grace is more than enough to
[1:39:43] meet our needs regardless of any
[1:39:45] challenges and difficulties in our life
[1:39:47] his grace cannot
[1:39:51] be always sufficient
[1:39:56] yes it's
[1:39:58] unlimited amen it's abundant and all
[1:40:03] incompass
[1:40:05] adequately thank you my grace is
[1:40:07] sufficient for this whatever situations
[1:40:10] you are in if you fail you have failures
[1:40:14] you have discouragement in life but you
[1:40:16] know that you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:40:18] God God his grace is sufficient for this
[1:40:29] amen so he said
[1:40:35] that uh the message what is the work of
[1:40:38] God I made a remark like that and they
[1:40:41] said then why did he permit
[1:40:44] Sin Sin works for his cause that's right
[1:40:49] that sometimes that I know when God's
[1:40:52] covenant unconditional he permits
[1:40:55] everything that comes our way we have
[1:40:57] failures we can sometimes we backbite
[1:40:59] sometimes we have some
[1:41:03] issues I always said that God permits
[1:41:06] everything that comes our
[1:41:08] way that is only to express his
[1:41:11] attributes in our life if you don't have
[1:41:14] any
[1:41:14] failure then you can not appreciate him
[1:41:19] to be Our
[1:41:20] Redeemer if you have no sickness you
[1:41:22] cannot magn pray his name to be our
[1:41:24] healer that's why everything that comes
[1:41:26] away is not for us to go
[1:41:28] down on it is to lift up his name in our
[1:41:32] life and then you become the word made
[1:41:38] manifest some of us will ask how are you
[1:41:41] sister I'm okay but she was in a fourth
[1:41:44] state cancer yeah come on but when ask
[1:41:47] oh I am okay praise
[1:41:49] God what is that he is confessing the
[1:41:52] UNC conditional grace of God and when
[1:41:55] she start confessing it God is going to
[1:41:58] perform
[1:42:01] it just like my just like my wife so
[1:42:05] simple so he's been uh having trouble
[1:42:07] with the stop for so many years he lost
[1:42:10] weight and everything then we went to
[1:42:12] the doctor and doctor said you need to
[1:42:13] have a
[1:42:15] uh you need to check it immediately
[1:42:18] because the doctor pronounced it that
[1:42:20] will be a cancer in your throat
[1:42:25] but we can keep on just believing that
[1:42:28] doesn't matter that's the opinion of men
[1:42:31] but the word say I am the Lord that
[1:42:33] Health all thy diseases from the
[1:42:36] smallest to the biggest amen even those
[1:42:40] who were not discovered yet the word of
[1:42:43] God is already pronounce it amen I am
[1:42:46] the God heal all kind of diseases the
[1:42:49] Discover one they soon to be discovered
[1:42:52] and those who are still
[1:42:54] following God has already provided for
[1:42:56] us just like our Salvation it was
[1:42:59] provided our Salvation was provided
[1:43:01] before the foundation of the
[1:43:05] world so that's why the doctor said you
[1:43:07] need to have the a check so when we went
[1:43:09] to she was already in the braining table
[1:43:12] when the look for chicken chicken chick
[1:43:14] there's nothing in
[1:43:15] there the Lord God Amen thank you Lord
[1:43:19] so we need we we don't need to tell it
[1:43:21] oh I am sick oh
[1:43:24] no you need to stand strong because you
[1:43:26] have the word of God in your life H
[1:43:29] don't be intimidated by what you feel or
[1:43:32] what the syum tells you but be firm in
[1:43:36] the word of God because the word of God
[1:43:38] will always manifest his grace and finan
[1:43:44] amen prise the Lord thank you
[1:43:48] Lord we need to
[1:43:51] Rejoice he saw your failure he saw your
[1:43:53] shortcoming he saw your depression he
[1:43:55] saw whatever things in comes in our life
[1:43:57] God knows about
[1:43:59] it but it doesn't mean that he don't
[1:44:02] love you amen even your trials that's
[1:44:05] sign of his
[1:44:06] love sir that's why the
[1:44:09] blessings not only we see
[1:44:12] things favorable in our way but when
[1:44:16] it's not favorable sometime we think oh
[1:44:18] I am being judged by God come
[1:44:21] on but the bless
[1:44:24] is a package
[1:44:27] deal when God gave a conditional
[1:44:30] Covenant it was a package deal Abraham
[1:44:33] had so many ups and downs in his life
[1:44:35] along the way to the
[1:44:38] Fulfillment of Isaac he had so many ups
[1:44:41] and downs he has uh he has what do we
[1:44:46] call this discouragement in his
[1:44:49] life it seems that he cannot make it it
[1:44:52] seems it comes in the way that he begin
[1:44:54] to doubt the word of God and he said
[1:44:57] Lord Give Me A Sign and God gave him a
[1:45:00] sign okay we will make a covenant cut
[1:45:02] this cut this cut
[1:45:04] that then another thing as he comes
[1:45:08] along the journey then he he lost his
[1:45:11] strength to move on then God revealed
[1:45:13] himself come unto me
[1:45:16] Abraham I am the El Shai come before me
[1:45:21] I will sustain you yes Hallelujah I give
[1:45:24] you strength to move on to fulfill that
[1:45:27] promise of Isaac amen hallelujah so
[1:45:31] along the way God is keeping his
[1:45:34] Covenant to each and every one of us God
[1:45:36] knows everything
[1:45:38] amen your eyes is upon this pulpit and
[1:45:41] God knows about it what's inside those
[1:45:44] smile what's inside those nding bear God
[1:45:47] knows about it some may be struggling
[1:45:49] right now financially spiritually
[1:45:51] physically praise got maybe a
[1:45:54] relationship struggle but God knows
[1:45:56] about
[1:45:57] it his grace is covered it all because I
[1:46:02] have already done it you need to go
[1:46:05] through to that kind of trials in order
[1:46:06] for you to magnify my name in the midst
[1:46:09] of your trial we only don't need praise
[1:46:12] God in our in the goodness but also in
[1:46:14] the bad
[1:46:15] times as brother on the bad times is the
[1:46:19] best time to praise the Lord amen
[1:46:24] amen when we came from the Philippines
[1:46:27] for after 15
[1:46:29] years it seems that our world is so
[1:46:34] dark we've been through a lot and it
[1:46:36] seems that it's so dark that we cannot
[1:46:38] move
[1:46:40] anything but we go back to the word of
[1:46:43] God Amen Paul said everything that comes
[1:46:47] away is for our own
[1:46:50] good all things works together for good
[1:46:52] today that love the Lord amen let your
[1:46:55] will be done Lord because I just believe
[1:46:57] your word whatever you want me to do I
[1:46:59] just believe your word you are our
[1:47:02] provider you our sustainer you are our
[1:47:05] strength amen you are our you are the
[1:47:08] peace and you are everything in our life
[1:47:10] I just commit myself and let your will
[1:47:12] be
[1:47:15] done I made a remark like that and they
[1:47:18] said then why did he permit sin and sin
[1:47:21] works for his cause sin works for his
[1:47:24] cause amen yes sir in God dwells all the
[1:47:28] great Glory if there had not been a
[1:47:31] sinner he'd never been a
[1:47:33] SE that's why we need to experience
[1:47:36] although we know the reality of
[1:47:38] predestination but when we bypass our
[1:47:41] toopan body and went directly to the
[1:47:44] Flesh in order praise God to be
[1:47:48] tempted that's why we need to experience
[1:47:50] being a
[1:47:51] sinner but but now we realize that we
[1:47:55] need to experience that in order to
[1:47:58] glorify God that he was our
[1:48:01] savior and there had been a sinner he
[1:48:04] hadd never been a savior in him was the
[1:48:06] attribute of a savior and sin had to
[1:48:10] project itself in order for him to be a
[1:48:13] savior amen hallelujah which is the most
[1:48:17] powerful a
[1:48:18] sinner sin or Grace is said Grace of
[1:48:22] course
[1:48:24] because Grace is unmerited favor it's
[1:48:27] nothing you have done or do or whatever
[1:48:29] in this word it was by God's grace that
[1:48:32] he chose
[1:48:34] you so when we realize the word of God
[1:48:37] that is being revealed in this way the
[1:48:39] grace of God you can find rest in his
[1:48:43] promises our struggle along the way will
[1:48:47] fail but it's okay amen we already know
[1:48:50] the tactic of Satan he allow everything
[1:48:54] to glorify his name which is the most
[1:48:57] powerful a sickness or a Healer well of
[1:49:00] course the Healer has power over
[1:49:02] sickness that's right and God if there
[1:49:04] never been sick person he'd never been a
[1:49:09] Healer and we see it perform in our
[1:49:13] congregation amen that God is with
[1:49:18] us if there never been sick person he'd
[1:49:21] never be a Healer so there had to be
[1:49:23] sickness to make him what he is a Healer
[1:49:27] there had to be sin to make him what he
[1:49:30] is a savior for sure amen this is just a
[1:49:36] short sermon that will give us
[1:49:39] encouragement and remembering the
[1:49:42] unconditional Covenant with God Amen
[1:49:45] don't struggle too
[1:49:48] much cuz sometimes when we receive Grace
[1:49:51] we end up with rules and regulation and
[1:49:53] sometime we stumble and sometime we are
[1:49:55] discouraged yes because the grace turned
[1:49:59] into laws and
[1:50:00] regulations but the grace of God is
[1:50:03] unconditional and it is eternal can we
[1:50:07] stand to our feet am I I as our
[1:50:13] musician amen Lord so we are by the
[1:50:17] grace of God in this last days there is
[1:50:20] no greater than the grace of God
[1:50:25] so the last quotation the message of
[1:50:27] Grace he said before the meeting closes
[1:50:29] today May there be something
[1:50:33] happen Lord that would bring your
[1:50:36] presence so close to the people that
[1:50:39] they would know that same Jesus that
[1:50:42] walk in Galilee stands in the midst of
[1:50:45] his
[1:50:46] people the same God that made flesh in
[1:50:50] the person of Jesus Christ is the same
[1:50:53] God that is in our midst
[1:50:56] today whatever your needs this morning
[1:51:00] what he performed then he will still
[1:51:02] performing it now because he never
[1:51:05] failed he's the same yesterday today and
[1:51:08] forever what a blessed people you
[1:51:11] are don't look at anybody's
[1:51:16] failure but look at what you can do yes
[1:51:20] for the glory of God
[1:51:22] because when we receive the grace of God
[1:51:24] in our life automatically we become a
[1:51:28] coworker with
[1:51:31] God God in one body but now God in many
[1:51:35] membered body that's why he has greater
[1:51:38] work thank you Lord because God is in a
[1:51:41] many membered body if you cannot preach
[1:51:45] you can
[1:51:46] pray you become an intercessor yes you
[1:51:51] are the one that will stop
[1:51:53] stand between the
[1:51:55] Gap because as we as the prophet said
[1:51:57] your
[1:51:59] prayer is a million times stronger than
[1:52:02] the angel amen you pray for one another
[1:52:06] pray for the ministers pray for
[1:52:09] everybody if you think somebody is
[1:52:11] struggling your prayer is a million
[1:52:14] times than the angel and God will honor
[1:52:16] it yes because you are his body in this
[1:52:20] generation yes
[1:52:22] that they would know that that same
[1:52:24] Jesus that walk in Galilee stand in the
[1:52:27] midst of his people they might go away
[1:52:30] from here today with the same assurance
[1:52:33] that those who came from emos that time
[1:52:37] when they were on their road back after
[1:52:39] walking with him all day long talking to
[1:52:42] him and him talking to them and yet they
[1:52:44] had little idea that it was
[1:52:48] him they went away after the crucifixion
[1:52:51] they walk going back toas and they were
[1:52:54] discouraged they're talking about the
[1:52:56] event that happening in the day but
[1:52:59] without knowing it God was in their
[1:53:02] midst and God opened the scripture that
[1:53:05] is being fulfilled in our day and they
[1:53:07] keep on talking keep on talking keep on
[1:53:09] talking until finally they invite come
[1:53:11] with us and they realize that it was God
[1:53:14] in their midst likewise the same is
[1:53:17] happening in our midst we may be here
[1:53:20] we're listening to a preacher but it was
[1:53:22] he actually speaking to you yes he is
[1:53:27] still the god that before his
[1:53:28] crucifixion he is breaking the bread of
[1:53:31] life and I believe he's still the same
[1:53:34] tonight or today he's still bre breaking
[1:53:37] the bread to each and every one of us
[1:53:39] that we recognize that he is in our
[1:53:41] midst in his presence in our midst this
[1:53:44] morning amen thank you Lord he said oh
[1:53:49] God so many times we are like that
[1:53:54] we're just walking we struggle without
[1:53:57] knowing that God is riding in our midst
[1:53:59] we
[1:54:00] just don't recognize the presence of the
[1:54:03] Lord oh remember his unconditional
[1:54:06] Covenant I will never leave you nor
[1:54:10] forsake you amen Jesus not only I will
[1:54:13] be with
[1:54:14] you but I will be in you
[1:54:18] hallelujah oh God so many times we are
[1:54:20] like that you speak to us in the setting
[1:54:23] of the
[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:25] Sun and sometimes we look at the Sunset
[1:54:28] and sometimes it give us
[1:54:32] sadness but actually God is trying to to
[1:54:36] speak to
[1:54:38] you when you feel sad when the sun
[1:54:40] setting when you see the sky beyond the
[1:54:44] curtain of life it's just like sadness
[1:54:47] depression stuck in because it's getting
[1:54:50] dark but actually it was God trying to
[1:54:54] speak unto you instead of instead of
[1:54:57] being said why don't you just kneel on
[1:54:59] your and pray
[1:55:01] Lord what is your plan for me today what
[1:55:03] is your plan for me for tomorrow yes let
[1:55:06] me let my life be worthy of the Gospel
[1:55:09] yes what is your plan
[1:55:13] Lord so let us be sensitive we are not
[1:55:16] ordinary
[1:55:17] people we are people saved by grace
[1:55:20] Hallelujah through the UNC
[1:55:22] unconditional Covenant of
[1:55:25] God he didn't chose us just because we
[1:55:27] are great or somebody or prestigious or
[1:55:30] something no we it's just by the grace
[1:55:33] of God yes oh God so many times we are
[1:55:36] like that you speak to us in the setting
[1:55:39] of the Sun in the singing of the birds
[1:55:41] in the rusting of the leaves in the
[1:55:43] blooming of the flowers in the hymn of
[1:55:45] the
[1:55:46] church and we are so little recognized
[1:55:49] that it's
[1:55:51] you in the sick room in the hospital
[1:55:54] many other places you speak to us and we
[1:55:56] so little realize that it's
[1:55:59] you remember God has mystery seal up in
[1:56:02] everything that he
[1:56:04] made all the natures and everything in
[1:56:07] animals in in B in life there's a
[1:56:11] mystery in the eagle of his great wings
[1:56:13] and his Great Eagle eyesight so that's
[1:56:15] why the prophet preach about the eagle
[1:56:17] and stir up her
[1:56:19] nest because there is a mystery behind
[1:56:22] those Eagles there's a mystery sealed up
[1:56:25] in the lion that's why when the seven
[1:56:28] seal was
[1:56:30] open you can see there was a white horse
[1:56:33] there was an ox there was a lion
[1:56:35] everything because they speak of the
[1:56:37] spirit in last last day I believe all
[1:56:39] the Myster is being revealed in our
[1:56:43] day there's a mystery seal up in the
[1:56:45] lion and in the ox and in the lamb and
[1:56:47] in the Dove and in The Great Whale of
[1:56:49] the ocean and in every animal and insect
[1:56:52] from antt to the elephant even King
[1:56:54] Solomon said told us that go to The Ant
[1:56:57] and consider her ways because there is a
[1:57:00] mystery sealed in the
[1:57:02] earth we can take example from the
[1:57:05] animal how the ant leaves how the Beast
[1:57:07] how they group together there is still a
[1:57:10] mystery and God is revealing himself in
[1:57:13] those things we just didn't recognize
[1:57:16] sometimes we is so common for us but if
[1:57:18] we become sensitive to the presence of
[1:57:20] God it was God trying to reveal
[1:57:22] something to each and every one of us
[1:57:25] and may the Lord give us more
[1:57:27] strength always remember that whoever
[1:57:30] things that comes your way remember his
[1:57:32] unconditional Covenant it was the grace
[1:57:35] of God that comes our way so what is the
