he was in Florida I think they put the prayer request out for me and had the heart attack in Florida but he lives in Washington so trying to get him rehabbed enough and he can't walk right now so try to get him rehabbed enough to get him flown home so I imagine that's pretty it's a pretty terrible situation to be out of state be stuck like that but you know what God's a way maker and so let's just sing That's How Great Is Our God and we'll have a pastor come and just take these needs before the Lord amen if you have a need challenge you to hold it before the Lord As we sing this just tell them

there's only one rock that I want to search to because in that rock is everything that we need everything that we needed in history everything that we need right now and everything that we will ever need in our future of Our Lives that's why I trust in him because he's got everything in his control let's pray this evening father we certainly thank you for another opportunity that we can gather in your house Lord to hear your word and I pray that your word father will have an effect in our lives Lord that when we leave we may be better Christians I pray for the needs that's upon the hearts of your people Lord that you would meet every single one of them for we know father that your word says that if we were to ask for bread would you give us a stone so therefore we know that if we would ask believing in our hearts Lord that you would Grant the very petitions of our hearts and we're trusting in that this evening bless the reading of your word the remainder of the service we give it all into thy hands for thy Kingdom's glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord thank you musicians if you have your Bibles turn with me to the Book of Luke chapter 8 and we'll read verses 40 through 48. we just greet you all this evening in the lovely name of Jesus Christ and we trust that you have come with an expectation upon your heart that perhaps God will say just a few words that might be quickened because we could speak and it would just be words but when we speak by inspiration and the word is quick into our hearts that's when it has an effect in our lives amen Luke chapter 8 verse 40 it says and it came to pass that when Jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him and behold there came a man named Jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at Jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house notice because he had a need in his house Jesus comes when there's needs in our lives for he had one only daughter about 12 years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people thronged him now I want you to just keep that in your mind that she was 12 years old because we're gonna find out that this this this woman that touches him she has an issue of 12 years and so it's it I believe that God is trying to show us something here about the number 12. amen and it's very exciting and the people thronged him and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which had spent all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood stenched and I don't know if I said that right but that's okay and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter and they that were with him said Master the people throng thee and press thee and says Thou who touched me and Jesus said somebody has touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace amen you may be seated this evening I would like to continue on with this subject of the great physician is here this is part two and I would like to take for this subject the woman with the blood issue now we find out uh that with this title The Great physician is here and so it's of great importance for us to believe that Christ is actually here and he is here in our midst because the Bible said that they were waiting for him and when he came they received him gladly now there's something about waiting for the presence of the Lord to come in our lives they were waiting in the upper room there's something about waiting it's we're so terrible at waiting for things that we want God to do it and we want him to do it now but God is not a god that is bound by time God is only bound to one thing and that's his word the word he says that he swore he could swear by no greater so he swore by himself so God actually binds himself to the very word of God so if there's anything that we need to have confidence in this evening it is the word of God so it's very important for us to believe that Jesus is not only coming Jesus is not only going to appear to us but he is here in the midst of us because when Jesus is amongst us guess what happens things change Hallelujah we have to realize that he is here no matter how we feel no matter of the emotion or of this sensation or how we feel in our mortal bodies but we have to have faith in God that he's here and he's here because he's the same yesterday today and forever and because he's the same he'll perform the same things that he did throughout the word hahaha we realize that God is not just a god of History who parted the Red Sea in the River Jordan but he is here this evening and God is more than able to accomplish anything that we give for him to do yes Hallelujah the Israelites were given a promise of a land that flowed with milk and honey but we find out that the banks of the River Jordan they were overflowed and and no doubts no doubt there was doubt that came in the Israelites mind they said why would God lead us to this Promised Land why would God lead us to this place when the banks are overflowing it just seems like it's impossible after impossible he led us he led us out and we crossed the Red Sea and it just seems like there's always an issue in my life that I have to overcome it's the issue in our lives that makes us Overcomers because without the issue we would never realize that we were able through God to overcome the issue so don't take your don't set your sights and your eyes upon the Earthly things but keep your eyes set upon the promise of God no doubt they looked at the situation and they murmured within themselves how are we going to cross this River Jordan understand brother Branham said that it was a type of death to self the seed has got to rot before it can bring forth life and so here they were they were at a stage in their lives where they had to die to self before the promise of God could come to pass in their lives I find it very fascinating how that they came to the River Jordan and God just didn't part it why wouldn't he just part it and they could just walk across and it would be all nice there would be no temptation there would be no doubt there'd be none of these things it would just be all perfect and easy and praise the Lord look what God did for us but the River Jordan did not part until the Israelites put their foot in the water when they reacted to the action when they reacted to what was set before them the reaction of God parted the River Jordan understand God is wanting you to get your feet wet he's wanting you to step out by faith and to cross that River Jordan you say well I'm just waiting for God to do it for me no God's waiting for you God's waiting for you to step out by faith and to get wet well I'm just gonna wait I'm just gonna wait God don't want you just to wait like that but God wants you to get in action Hallelujah God is still God but what God is doing is he's waiting to see your reactions to those things that are placed in front of you so how is your reaction how has your reaction been since Sunday Monday Tuesday and here we are now we're on Wednesday how was your reactions been through your daily life has it been a reaction of Faith or has it been a reaction of Doubt has it been a reaction of well this is in front of me but I believe God is more than able or is it a reaction of look what I have to deal with today it's one thing after another guess what you better get happy with it being one thing after another because it's never going to change it's going to be one thing after another one thing after another but it'll give us the opportunity for one Victory after another for another time to overcome after another Hallelujah for another time to exercise our faith time and time and time again now we realize that a lot of people they don't know what the will of God is for certain subjects that's written within the word now we as Believers we can't have faith in something we can't have faith in God until we know what his will is first within the word when we understand what God's will is it gives us the ability to have faith to come before God have you ever heard somebody say well God if it if this be your will the reason we're asking that question is because we don't know what the will of God is now God's will is his word so it's very important for us to understand if we want to know what the will of God is we need to see it written within the word and when we see it written within the word then we can have confidence that we can come before God with a boldness and say God your word says about this certain subject and I am a son and I am a daughter of God and I am approaching You Now by faith because your word declares it you see the difference none of this be your will but God I know what your will is therefore I'm asking by faith in the written word don't forget we're talking about healing once again yeah so in order for us as a body and as individuals for us to realize what the will of God is uh concerning healing we need to see it within the scriptures what good is it yeah I heard a testimony of a person one time this person over here got healed and this person over here got touched and praise the Lord if God can do it for them he can do it for me that's true but you can't anchor your faith in the testimony of another person a testimony of another person can encourage you it can help you along the way it can help build your faith up a little bit but it's not something that you can anchor your faith in the only thing as Believers that we can anchor in is the word of God and when our faith is anchored in the word it doesn't matter what anybody else's testimony is because what would happen if a person was declared healed and then they got sick again and you're basing your faith upon upon what God did for them but all of a sudden they get sick oh my well if if they got sick it's going to happen to me all oh my goodness well maybe it's not and no you see the importance it's good testimonies are good they're wonderful they help us they encourage us but our anchor has got to be within the written word because when we're anchored in the word we will not fail Hallelujah so if I was to ask you the question this evening do you believe that God is still a Healer no doubt a hundred percent of your hands would raise up and you would say yes sir brother I believe that God Is A Healer my next question would be this why do you believe it is it because somebody told you that he is it because of the testimony of somebody else or is it because you see it written within the word I turn the pages from Genesis to Revelations and I see that God is still a Healer because if you believe because someone told you it's the truth when they tell you the opposite you will also believe them and become confused so don't just take somebody's word for it take God's word for it Hallelujah and when we take God's word for it then we can really start believing and asking in faith now you might be saying brother Stephen third pool Ministry we don't we don't need uh we're in no no longer we don't need an healing of the body and and you're you're so far behind and and uh and sure maybe a little bit forgive me for that but I think sometimes we just need a little reminding now what's what's interesting about the third pool is the third poll brought to us a revelation of God that was never given before so when we talk about the third pool and we talk about it being the revealing of the word and brother Branham said it was the the opening the revealing of those Seven Seals that's what the third pull is he said it is the revealing of the word of God and we all said amen because we understand that so if we take it a little bit further now and we say well if it's the revealing of the word what is the word now the Bible says that in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word was God so what is this third pull Ministry it's a revealing of God himself it's a revealing of God that mankind never had since the days of the Fall In the Garden of Eden up until when the seals were revealed and opened when you listen to Billy Graham and all Roberts and these different men very fantastic Godly Man fantastic speakers but you never hear these men speak on predestination you never hear these men speak on things that were before and things that are to be and and the going the secret going away of the church and and all these different deep things that we are uh that we understand as the bride of Christ why weren't they preaching those same things because it wasn't revealed to them to preach those things and so with the revealing of the word God has actually been unfolding himself in this end time he has taken a word that was sealed and was bound by Seven Seals and he opened it up before our very wandering eyes and so now we can see a god before he was even god brother Branham says he was Elohim and we see God condescending and why did he can't descend because he wanted to be a part of his creation he wanted to have a closer relationship with his people and he is continue now to unfold his mind since there was hidden since the foundations of the world so it's more than just well yeah the word is opened yeah praise the Lord but it's actually God unveiling and unfolding The Plan of Redemption what a revelation this message is yeah praise God the book is opened but he has been doing so much more told us things which are things which are were things which are and things which are to be he showed us the the the the the the uh the two Spirits working throughout the framework of the church why would he want to tell us those things why would he want to reveal to us those things because when we see the wrong kind of spirit in the church we could recognize it it's not just a preaching of church history but it's a revelation of the two Spirits within the framework to where we could say that's not the spirit of Christ that's nicolaitanism we need to get that out from amongst us you see it's just not history but it's God revealing something behind it Hallelujah now we find out that when God is revealing himself and he is unfolding himself we realize that he is not only revealing himself but he is revealing everything that is a part of him amen he is revealing every person and he is making it known to every person who was in his mind since the foundations of the world and he's making it known unto them who they are where they came from and where they're going now brother Branham he said it's very important for us to realize who we are as Believers and it's very important for us to realize our position in the body of Christ what's so important about it because with the understanding of your position within the body with your understanding of who you are in God's word and that you are Mrs Jesus Christ there comes along with that an authority because how can you have authority when you don't know who you are you don't know where you came from you don't know if you're a part of God or not how can you have authority when you don't know those things but when we realize Who We Are when we realize our position within the body of Christ it brings with it an authority now brother Branham he would talk about that little policeman and he said a policeman would go out here and uh if he wasn't in his uniform or anything like that and he tried to stop traffic guess what he'd probably get run over he don't got no Authority he don't got no power over anything why because he looks he's just a man but when he puts his police uniform on when he shows his little badge when he begins to toot his little whistle guess what a card that's going 50 60 miles per hour will come to a halt it's the same man the same person doing the same thing but now he has an authority with him when he shows that badge and he shows who he is now he's not standing alone now he has a full backing of the state police now he has the backing of the judge now he has the backing of the lawyers of the city the same man he has no more power than he did before but now he has an authority so it is with us without knowing our position there's no Authority we're on our own we have no backing but when we realize who we are when we realize there's a work that has to be done that God has given us an authority over this flesh all hail trembles our problem is we don't use it enough we're too scared to use it we don't have faith enough to use it we need to get our feet wet and use the authority that God has given you an authority that we can claim the promises of God and stand in faith how can I stand by faith because I got someone who's backing me I got someone who's greater than my flesh man I got someone who's greater than my circumstance I've got the supreme authority not only is he with me but he's in me he's got my back he's got my sides he's got my front he's all around us you know you have authority over your flesh you know you can bring that thing under subjection you know when your flesh is trying to tell you to do one thing you can tell it to do another did you know that you don't have to listen to your flesh wow you mean I don't have to do everything and say everything that comes into my mind no if it's not according to the word let it alone you mean I have authority over my tongue you bet you mean I have authority over Envy bet your bottom dollar God has given you supreme authority over this flesh man don't be scared to use it I want to remind you to use it because the more you use it the more it works the more that we exercise our faith the more that we exercise our authority over this guy you know too many people they want to exercise their authority over everybody else they want to exercise their authority to cast out Devils into these many mighty works well let me ask you why because they want it all for themselves they want the glory for themselves that's why it'll never work but when you exercise it over yourself first when you help yourself first then you can help others how can you help somebody with a lustful Spirit if you got one yourself how can you help somebody that's got an issue when you've got the exact same issue yourself but if we could just learn by the word of God and realize I have authority over this thing this stinking flesh we depend too much on this guy you lean too much on this guy and you know what he does every time you lean on him get you in trouble why do you want to trust in somebody who gets you in trouble every time you trust in them it's not a good friend to have you're all laughing because you know it's the truth so we realize that God has given the bride an authority over these things now when we look at the five identifications there was an authority that a Son of God had over situations that came up in his life we could look back to the little fishy that was given life back when it had died we realize now watch the authority of God in a human being a little fishy what is a little fishy it's it's part of it's part of nature it's an animal so now what because God is showing us something through these identifications follow this thought with me the little fishy that was given back its life we realize that there's Authority given over animals didn't Adam have complete authority over all the animals and over all the fish and over all these other things didn't brother Branham said that we're going back to what Adam had that Jesus Christ restored everything that Adam lost okay now you're with me now follow these identifications we realize that brother Branham he spoke to the wind he spoke to the storm what's God trying to show us that there's an authority over nature follow along with me we realized that there was an authority given Over The Souls of men sister Hattie writes two boys I give you your boys in the name of Jesus Christ supreme authority over the souls of men we also realized that there was an authority over healing and sickness within the body sister Mita his wife she had the tumor well why didn't God take the tumor away brother Branham prayed for her multiple times but when she got on to that operating table guess what it wasn't there God's timing is always perfect so we realize that we have an authority now over the sickness of our bodies and what is it that gives us that Authority it's the third pool the revealing of God himself is letting us know that these things are under our feet part of the third pool Hallelujah there's one that I'm missing I did four of them who's paying attention squirrels bless you brother Emmanuel they're squirrels what's he showing over what's he what's he trying to show us he's trying to show us now that there's complete authority over the spoken word The Souls of man nature animals healing within our bodies and speaking things which were not as though they were God has given us full authority over these things so we find out that now what is we find out that healing now is actually a part of the third pull Ministry not only of the body but a healing of the Mind a healing of the spirit a healing of the Soul a healing of the Brokenhearted because God has unfolded himself and he has let us know that he is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah he's just made it more clear to us than ever before now we find that one of the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah is Jehovah Rapha which means I am the Lord that healeth thing now this we understand it's an attribute of God that can never be taken away from him it is an eternal attribute of God that makes known to us that is made known to us through sickness so how is God making himself known as I am the Lord who heals Thee I am the Lord who heals all your diseases because we have it in our lives and therefore because of this He makes himself known and he says oh yeah you got something in your heart you got a sickness in your life I am Jehovah Rapha and I change not I don't change for no man I don't change for no pulp I don't change for no Creed but he is the same no there's something that I've started to study on and it's very interesting brother Branham talks about he said if you go out into a field in a dark night and he said and you go out and you start speaking and you start saying let there be lights and let there be electricity and and I want this field to light up and let it happen God and let it happen brother Branham said there's enough electricity in that field to light up that whole field he says but what you have to do is you have to channel that electricity through wires there's a channel that has to come in order for this electricity that we do not see that flows through this world that we're living in there's a channel that it has to be operated on in order for it to work he says it's the same thing with God you've got to approach God and you've got to uh Channel your thoughts and to the word and to the will of God I think personally that that's our problem we don't know how to channel it we believe that it's the truth we know that it's the truth but we lack the understanding in how can I Channel my faith to God's word in order to bring it to pass in our lives as far as I've gotten on it but I believe that once it begins to open up that it'll change something in my heart especially and how we approach and and how we ask God for things in our lives a lot of the times when we ask we're asking a miss but if we can Channel it in the right direction through the filter of the word I believe that God will come on the scene amen so we see that every Redemptive name of Jehovah was expressed through Jesus Christ so it behooves us if we want to know uh the characteristics of God all we have to do as Believers is to look at the Life of Christ one thing about Christ is that he hated religion he hated religious people and he had absolutely no time for it God feels the exact same way with us he hates religion he hates the traditions of man there's only one thing and one thing alone that God loves and that's faith Hallelujah now let's read a few scriptures Exodus 24 verse 25. and ye shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee Exodus 15 verse 26 and said of thou will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that healeth thee what are we doing we're reading the will of God concerning healing Jeremiah 17 verse 14 Heal Me O Lord and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved for thou art my praise James 5 14-16 as any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed so if you want to be healed in your body there's a couple of things that you need to do you need to confess your faults one to another and you need to pray for other people what a selfless Act that though there's a need within our own bodies the Bible is telling us to do the contrary don't pray for yourself don't take self-pity on yourself but pray for those who are in need that the Lord May heal your body the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much one more scripture Matthew 10 verse 1. and when he had called on to him as 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases it is throughout the word of God that if you ever had a doubt within your mind does God still heal there should be no doubts as you search the scriptures from Genesis to Revelations that he still heals you say brother Stephen have you ever seen a miracle in your life Have You Ever Seen The Lame walk have you ever seen the blind giving back their lives have you ever seen a miracle where something extreme just happened and praise the Lord that is amazing no I haven't but let me declare to you this evening that God still opens the blinded eyes God still causes the lame to walk God still raises the dead God still does those things he said brother how do you know that because I see it written within the word brother Branham said excuse me if I get the number mixed up he said if I pray for a thousand or ten thousand people and every one of them died in the morning I would still pray for the sick why would he do that because his word declares it so our faith isn't depending upon what happens and what doesn't happen but our faith is depending upon one thing and that's the word of God well I haven't seen it performed in my life Stephen keep praying and God will do it so our faith shouldn't be determined upon how we feel are what we see or what we touch or or what somebody else tells us but our faith should be anchored in the word and the word alone that's why the prophet brought us back to the word he said it time and time again get back to the word get back to the word why did they have to get back to the word because they left the word and when you leave the word there's no Authority but when you're back upon the word covered by the blood all things are possible all things brother Stephen all things there's nothing too difficult so what happens if you pray for brother Neil and he still has to get his legs amputated we'll pray for the next person humble pray for the next person don't fail to see the miracle in brother Neil's life he was supposed to be dead he wasn't supposed to make it he was the miracle man he is the Miracle Man so don't cast out what God has done in his life and the restoration that God is doing in his life and the healing that God is going to bring in his life Hallelujah just because of one little thing he's a miracle how many of you you can say I'm a miracle amen Leviticus 15 19-29 we find out that this woman in our opening scripture she had an issue of blood now this scripture is going to kind of give us a little insight into the life of this woman with this Blood issue of what she dealt with and and and and and how much of an outcast she actually was in verse 19 it says and if a woman have an issue and her issue is in her flesh Be Blood she shall be put apart seven days and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even so notice a woman with the blood issue or her her monthly cycle however you want to put it if she touches anything or anybody touches her that thing is unclean she is unclean that person is unclean until even and everything that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean and whosoever touches her bed she'll wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even I'm sure we are all noticing right away that this woman was unclean she was an unclean person why because she had a a continuous flowing of blood that could not be stopped the doctors could not stop it the Physicians could not stop it and because of this issue now she was an outcast in her life let's keep reading and if any man lie with her at all and her flowers be upon him he shall be unclean seven days and all the bad were on he lieth shall be unclean and if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation or if it run beyond the time of her separation all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation she shall be unclean 12 years here she was an unclean person according to the law before the Jewish people every bed we're on she lieth all the days of her issues shall be unto her as the bed of her separation and whatsoever she said at the pawn shall be unclean as the uncleanness of her separation and whosoever touches those things shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even no doubt this woman was a Castaway from the Jewish community and the place where she was raised and where she lived it wasn't her fault it wasn't anything that she had done but it was an issue of blood that was upon her body and she was very aware of what the law of God says according to her how she was to separate herself according to the amount of days that this issue would happen and we see that for 12 years she was unclean for 12 years she had this issue for 12 years before the people she was unclean she was a separated person the issue in her life had separated her from the people surrounding her how many times in our lives does an issue come upon us and the one thing that it does it drives us back from the people of God except for us separates us away from the people who want to help us the most because we're embarrassed or because uh whatever the issue may be but whatever it is it causes us now to take a step back it causes us now to stop fellowshipping with the very people that want to help us that's exactly what Satan wants to do in our lives he wants to separate you and get you away from the flock because he understands that a sheep by itself is defenseless a lot of times with a young person when there's sin in their lives it'll cause them to separate and pull back from the rest of the people within the church why because they're hiding something they're ashamed they're ashamed to get around God's people they're ashamed to approach them they're ashamed to approach God don't let sin shame you sin will only shame you if you let it shame you sin will only shame you if you stay away from God if you stay away from having a repenting heart that's why brother Branham said the wonderful thing about David was he was quick to repent be quick to repent be zealous there are therefore and repent Hallelujah I'm sure I'm sure this woman had heard about Jesus I'm sure she had heard about all the mighty Miracles that he had done that he had done throughout Israel and Judea I'm sure she had heard about how he spat on the ground and he took the mud and he applied it to a person's eyes and their and their sight was given back and I'm sure she had heard about how he told the man to pick up his bed and walk and I'm sure she had heard about all the wonderful Mighty things that God had done but yet hearing about what Jesus had done wasn't good enough for her she had to do something about it herself foreign we find out that can you imagine the turmoil that she was going through when she heard Jesus was passing by I am an unclean person I can't be out amongst all the people I know he's coming I see I see the people I I see the multitude has gathered and and but I I I don't know if I should or not I I know I can't I shouldn't be out amongst the people have I touch someone they're going to be unclean and how am I going to do this can you imagine the turmoil that she was going to do fighting through those doubts of fear and I know that Torah says this and I know but there was something that was that was gripped and anchored within her soul that give her a purpose that said I need to touch the master perhaps she thought if I but touch His Garment he won't be completely unclean because I know if I touch him and I approach him if he touches me or I touch him we're all going to be unclean and I'm just gonna mess everything up she had no scripture for what was purposed within her heart to do there was no scripture that she could lay her faith on and say oh thy but touch the Hem of His Garment I know I'll be whole she had no scripture for it no priest told her about it no preacher told her about it but the Holy Ghost he was the one that revealed it to her if you do this thing have you touched the Hem of His Garment you're going to be made whole that's what we need we need a sure solid foundational faith in God that we know he's going to perform his word in our lives she purposed within her heart all of a sudden it didn't matter I don't care who I get around I don't care who my skirt touches I don't care if I gotta push people out of the way I gotta get to the master she had a purpose within her heart we need to have a purpose in our hearts I say God Don't Pass Me By Lord but I want to reach out and I want to touch you by faith now we find out that the moment that she touched him she was made completely whole she didn't touch him as the others touched him there was a lot of people that were around him they were thronging him they were grabbing him they were they were pulling on him and no doubt it was it was hard for him to get around because the people were surrounding him and and everybody wanted a piece of him but she had something that they did not have she had something that was revealed to her heart that it was a faith and a faith which caused a virtue to come out of his his very body he said he touched me who did that who touched me who was it he's calling them out and Peter said oh master master all the people are touching here why why would you say that why would you say who touched you he said I perceived that virtue husband out of me when we reach out and when we touch God by faith understand things change when we reach out by faith it touches the heart of God and it causes these great attributes that he has within himself now to be released upon that believer how did she do it she didn't touch him by her Earthly senses but it was something very Supernatural it wasn't something that was drummed up it wasn't something that she was told by another human being but it was something that was personal between God and Almighty and her issue in her heart oh my if we could only touch out Reach Out And Touch him huh because let me say this Jesus is passing by We Believe within his word that it says if two or more gathered in my name I'll be in their midst I pray that God now here's something that I was thinking about today give me a few more minutes here's something that I was thinking about today was this so much of the time we put God in a little box and we say father I pray that you'll move in the church service on Sunday I pray that you'll move on the church service on Wednesday night I pray that you'll do this and I pray that you'll do that and that lives will be changed and we put God in a little spiritual box for Wednesday night and Sunday mornings we come to church expecting to hear from God become the church expecting God to move and expecting God to speak to hearts and expecting God to do something but there's five more days in the week that we forget that we can get up in the morning and we say father I don't see a change in my life but I'm expecting you to move he is a God who moves on Monday 24 7. he is the god who moves on Tuesday 24 7. Wednesday 24 7 Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday because he is a God who does not sleep nor does he slumber the purpose why people are touched in a church service is because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God and it encourages our faith but if we were to encourage our faith throughout the rest of the week to take time to spend with God ourselves to take time to meditate upon his promises to take time to meditate upon his word you might just be driving down the road someday and God will touch your body no hands laid upon you no anointing with oil no nothing why because you've been in the presence of God that's what makes the difference and if you're the temple of God hallelujah wherever you go God goes with you so if we could just have faith the rest of the days of the week instead of waiting for Wednesday and Sunday God might have a little bit more of an opportunity to do something in our lives don't just box God up for a couple of days a week amen amen so we find uh so we see this number 12. so we realize there's 12 tribes of Israel there was 12 Tri there was 12 Spies across the river Jordan there was there was 12 disciples 12 baskets of fragments was taken up after feeding the uh the multitude there and one of Jesus's Miracles we see as you go through scriptures 12 12 12. what is the number 12 Got to Do with It we know that the number three is is perfection and we know that the number five is Grace we know that the number seven is completion we know that the number 50 is Jubilee but what is so important about the number 12 Y-12 and Investments brother Branham said 1963 it's right now midnight science says it's three minutes to midnight but this might be your Midnight Hour it's exactly on the dot 12 o'clock 1963. midnight stroke for some of you you'll either accept it not accept me not accept what I said but accept the Full Gospel the full power the full Bible everything that God says accept it or it'll be too late he's talking about his 12 minutes to midnight and he happens to look at the clock and he says wow it's 12 o'clock what's God trying to show us there's something about 12. we're in the Midnight Hour the first seal 1963 and oh I would have absolutely today I hope that people are spiritual I would have had a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that I was writing down to say the spoken word is the Original Seed everything is in threes three is a perfect number five is the number of gray seven completion 12. is worship 40 tempted and 50 is the Jubilee the very word Pentecost means Jubilee 50c and now God in his numerals he's perfect in his numerals he's perfect in his word he's perfect in his action he's perfect in everything because he's a perfect God yeah the number 12 what does it have to do with it has to do with worship so here was Jairus and his daughter was 12 years old and he puts them within the same story there's this girl she was 12 years old she was a laying dying this woman had this issue of blood for 12 years now the number 12 brother Branham said is the number of worship so what is he trying to show us about these examples as written within the scripture the greatest need that was in their lives they weren't worshiping God they weren't at church oh Hallelujah hallelujah oh I worship you God life is good I'm on the Mountaintop it's fantastic I feel the presence of God no they were in a valley they were in The Darkest Hour of their lives she had a desperate need that she needed to touch Jesus jairus's daughter was in a desperate need she lay a dying they were in the greatest turmoil of their life but they were associated with the number 12. how were they associated with worship in a time of their life where it seemed that nothing was going right there was hurdle after hurdle there was just no cure she lay and die and here she had this Blood issue but yet she was worshiping God almighty how were these people worshiping God let me tell you why it is extremely simple that they were not looking to their issues they were not looking to their circumstances but they were standing by faith so whenever we stand by faith in the word of God it is true worship in the eyes of our father not just when we sing not just when we praise yes it's good it's a sweet smelling Savor but when we approach God by faith a supernatural substance that has taken over our Natural Body amen that's what he requires of us the number 12. true worship pure worship that when he comes by we reach out and we touch him Hallelujah they both operated by faith and because they lived their lives according to Faith and they approached them according to Faith it was true worship it was a sweet smelling savior in the nostrils of God so you say brother Stephen yeah I'm having an issue and this and that guess what you're doing you were worshiping God almighty he is bringing uh we're an attribute worship out of your heart that you didn't even know existed it's an attribute of God true worship and here we are thinking oh my goodness it's just when everything's good and praise the Lord and and the service and oh yeah it was nice and I felt the presence of God and everything guess what Billy when you were locked up and you were praying guess what it was you were worshiping God whether you realized it or not there was a sweet smell and savior that was coming from Mexico from a young American citizen and God was well pleased with it why because the life was operating by faith as the musicians come we'll bring it to a close we realize that your confession is only as strong as your faith and your faith is only as strong as your understanding of the will of God your confession is only as strong as the faith within your heart because if you believe you're going to confess it it doesn't matter what's going on in this circumstance it doesn't matter how I feel it doesn't matter but my faith is telling me that God has already healed my circumstance God has already healed my body God has already healed my broken heart God has already healed my broken spirit but if your faith isn't there you'll say well if God will if it be the will of God we'll see what happens don't plant those seed of Doubt within your mind but say father I believe that all things are possible and I'm confessing a complete Restoration in my life you know that it's that it's okay to ask God like for that bully you know God doesn't mind whenever you approach him that way because you're approaching him according to his word [Music] God help us [Music] to put into action what we believe they put our feet and chilly Jordan's River Lord the waters is not parted I thought by now by the time we got there surely this Promised Land I can see it with my own eyes and I can almost taste the air but there's lies before us God is waiting for you to step out by faith he's waiting for you to get your feet wet he's waiting for you to make the first move [Music] the woman's confession was that if I can only but Touch the Hem of His Garment uh uh I'll be made whole [Music] jairus's confession was if you come and pray for my daughter she will be made whole also even when he got word of hey don't bother the master anymore she died she she passed it's it's it's it's done it's too late uh that just just just don't bother him there's there's other things that he could be doing there's other people that he could be saying to now notice the faith of Jairus when the woman was healed immediately he didn't get envious within his heart he didn't say well he called I talked to him first and she took my spot she skipped the line she's an unclean woman and that's never should have happened and yeah [Music] but Faith rose up within her heart in his heart I know yeah she's dead this is this is what we've been told yeah okay but Jesus said only believe [Music] oh my the sweetest words probably that he ever heard I only believe I believe Lord help out my unbelief these lessons that we can learn within the scriptures people with a positive confession he said oh if I can only get him to my daughter I know I know I know that she'll be well if I can only touch His Garment I know it I know I'll be made whole let me ask you this evening what is your confession what is your confession about the will of God and what God can do for you in your life you don't only have to apply this to healing but you can apply this to anything any circumstance any issue that is within your life [Music] what is your confession do you have hope rather than faith well I believe God can but do you believe that God will [Music] because when we believe that God will God will and if we believe that God can sure he can but if we never ask and say God I know that you will I don't know when I don't know how I don't know if it's going to be in church I don't know if it's going to be at home I don't know if it's going to be at work or driving in my car or wherever it is I don't know where but I know Lord that you will and I know that you will because I have read your will and I know that what your will is therefore I'm hiding your will and my heart so that no man can take it away from me this is God's will concerning me this is God's will concerning my issue this is God's will concerning my family and you cannot take it away from me why because it's somewhere that you cannot touch it's mine it belongs to me [Music] and so now when we step out by faith and we say God I'm no longer hoping I'm not just trusting in you with a hope but I'm trusting in you that you will [Music] Hebrews 10 verse 23 it says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering hold on to it hold on to it tightly the confession of your faith not the confession of the preacher's faith not the confession of someone else's testimony around you but the confession of your faith as an individual in the body of Jesus Christ let us hold fast this profession let me hold on to it tightly let me grip it as hard as I can let me trust in it that it's going to come and come to pass at some time in my life and I don't know how I don't know it doesn't matter who cares how it happens you care when it's going to happen but when we put our full trust in God and we say Lord I know it was the blood for me Lord and I know that upon calvary's tree you were wounded for my transgressions and by your stripes I am healed and I got to thinking about today and I begin to pray and I begin to intercess for others and I began to say Lord don't let it be about me but father let Faith rise up in the hearts of your believers let Faith rise up in my heart that I can believe for somebody else's need that we could pray one for another and that by your intercessory prayer that that person could be healed and they know nothing about it how great and wonderful would that be he says the Bible says for he is faithful that promised he's so faithful that there's not one of his words that will pass away there's not one of his words that will ever fail Hallelujah Let's Dance [Music] we will find he's not too busy [Music] love and touch the Lord [Music] you will hide his objectives [Music] Jesus [Music] Reach Out And Touch the Lord [Music] that God still moves do you believe that oh God [Music] I love his people God still live oh he does [Music] please [Music] are still true [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh God [Music] a couple of prayer requests to come in Sister Deville and asked prayer for her two grandchildren I believe is William and Isabelle they've strep throat and coven and the sister Nancy Champion had a request for her daughter Sarah next Wednesday has a test she needs to pass to be able to get a job in your trust she said we're trusting in Jehovah Jireh and I don't know a better place to lay our faith than that so let's just pray together over these couple needs that he came in here and let's just remember our brother Neil and then we'll sing the dismissal song Heavenly Father God we thank you Lord for your words your word is spirit and truth and life to his father God and we see that these needs Lord you place in our body it's the law of contrast God we wouldn't know you as healer or way maker Lord without these needs in our body God and when one member of the body hurts Lord we all heard father so Lord we pray you would go and be the healer Lord the Waymaker Lord to deliver God that you would set those that captive free father Lord we pray God you'd be a great comforter Lord and a Great Peacemaker for our brother Neil Lord tomorrow God and his family Lord sister Carolyn Lord and all those around him Lord be with our pastors he goes Lord as a Shepherd over a sheep father a great burden upon him Lord to see a friend Lord to go through something of this magnitude God but we know it's all for your glory Lord Jesus in our human intellect and understanding Lord things may never make sense on this side of Glory God but we know you're working all things for your glory Lord and we just testify now Lord that we trust you father Lord because we know that you didn't start a work to leave it half finished Lord but you're a God who does things completely Lord and when you spoke us into existence before the foundation of the world God we were not a partial work Lord but we were made whole Lord we were completed in you Lord Jesus we thank you for that God just be with each and every person here or meet every need Lord according to your word father bless our brother Stephen for pouring himself out Lord we love you and we appreciate you father listening amen as we go let's see this take me deeper take me deeper he was preaching tonight I
