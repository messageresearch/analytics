[29:24] the Living God to come uh to the service
[29:28] tonight uh so we can uh spend the time
[29:30] in his presence in fellowshipping with
[29:33] the word uh but God grace we are still
[29:37] continuing with uh this series of uh
[29:41] seeing Jesus and his program uh and also
[29:44] we'll try to uh make a little bit of uh
[29:47] step uh forward of um accessing the word
[29:52] or access to the word uh got a little
[29:55] bit a few questions on uh
[29:58] the act the way we were accessing
[30:01] communism and because um we think that
[30:06] uh many things have been preached and
[30:10] people focus on certain areas in the
[30:13] message uh and at times when you go back
[30:17] to the prophet but it still seems like
[30:19] you know we never heard this but but
[30:22] it's still in the message uh but by
[30:24] God's grace um it's been um wonderful
[30:28] very very great blessing to me because
[30:32] uh at
[30:34] times when we finish to preach here it's
[30:37] we get more than we can bring and
[30:39] otherwise we'll spend probably a year or
[30:42] two just on one on one stage and it's
[30:45] not good but it's just like you know
[30:47] give these a little things that's why I
[30:49] think the Lord's leading me to give the
[30:52] way to be able to access the word so
[30:55] that some of these things that when we
[30:57] holding this language it may not be so
[31:00] hard to understand for those who are
[31:02] coming up but also for the ones that are
[31:05] seeing it right away may God bless you
[31:08] but we laboring on the field
[31:11] understanding that you know it's on
[31:13] different level so at times like you
[31:15] know we can focus on the grown ones and
[31:18] we focus on the younger ones and at
[31:20] times we just keep a balancing between
[31:22] according to his leadership of course as
[31:25] he wants the things to be accessed
[31:28] um seeing that we started with uh um
[31:33] still on seeing Jesus and his program uh
[31:36] seeing that
[31:37] communism as the prophet has been
[31:40] showing it unto us since 49 as he had
[31:43] seen it glooming upon the Earth and
[31:46] later on he saw it two3 of the world
[31:49] going into uh communism and we had also
[31:53] seen that um communism is not just the
[31:57] political system
[31:58] that uh came out of Russia because we
[32:01] understand that um the God gave the
[32:05] prophet the understanding the vision uh
[32:07] the seven Visions all the seven Visions
[32:10] uh showing um naism and fascism to be
[32:15] swallowed up um into the third which is
[32:18] communism which actually happened as we
[32:21] look into history uh around the um the
[32:26] third third war and uh that's where the
[32:29] whole uh communism thing started going
[32:32] around the globe and all these things
[32:35] but at the end of the day the way we
[32:39] access the word is not just by looking
[32:42] at history because when we just look at
[32:45] history we can see out there on the
[32:47] field on the land that people have
[32:50] access to history they read all kind of
[32:53] things and they come up with all type of
[32:55] conclusions they say like you know oh
[32:57] Christian it is uh is the worst things
[33:00] that ever happened to humanity because
[33:03] um they are the ones the Protestants and
[33:07] the Pentecostals all of them they were
[33:10] free m because uh U the way they
[33:14] presenting things they have access to
[33:16] knowledge but it required the prophet to
[33:20] come and give us the access to see how
[33:23] to look at all that information because
[33:26] he says that hey I don't believe
[33:29] everything I read but it's according to
[33:32] the Lord who comes down and shows to me
[33:35] how to be able to look at those events
[33:38] because when you look at for instance in
[33:40] the book of uh uh the church ages it
[33:43] says that you know uh when uh the Greece
[33:46] Greek were um building the temples it
[33:49] says like you know to me this was the
[33:52] age where they were uh pouring a lot of
[33:55] uh the connection the deeding and and
[33:59] all these connections the way he was
[34:01] laying it and bringing the types of a
[34:03] normal life somebody just goes to work
[34:06] and comes back and he tells them like no
[34:09] no that's
[34:11] communism how come somebody going to
[34:13] work and coming back it's
[34:17] communism it was such a mystery people
[34:20] couldn't access it people couldn't
[34:22] understand how communism could just be
[34:25] the fact of somebody working up and
[34:27] going work
[34:28] but then by God's grace that's why we
[34:30] try to see on how to be able to access
[34:33] the word
[34:35] because all these things that we have in
[34:37] the
[34:38] message it's not meant to bring all type
[34:42] of doctrines as we see today because the
[34:46] way somebody have seen it along the
[34:49] years that you'll probably noce it in
[34:52] the way somebody preaches the way he
[34:54] presented he presents his sermon the way
[34:57] he leads his church is because he has
[35:00] focused his ministry on certain
[35:03] quotations and when he does that it then
[35:07] limits his view on how to be able to
[35:11] move onto the next stage of the ministry
[35:14] that's why even my first sermon here on
[35:16] the pulpit was the work of the ministry
[35:19] it sounded as a harsh sermon on the
[35:22] first time that somebody comes on the
[35:24] pulpit but normally that's not the point
[35:27] the access here is we're looking at what
[35:31] the prophet has brought the key that he
[35:33] has given to us and that will apply to
[35:37] every single one of us Church individual
[35:39] families and then everyone should be
[35:42] able to see on how to move forward but
[35:45] then like you know when we preach for
[35:47] instance against like you know women you
[35:49] shouldn't put those extension high heels
[35:52] and stuff and you should have long
[35:54] dresses to one that can feel as it's a
[35:57] law but instead it's not a law because
[36:00] we're not here to preach the law but
[36:02] when you understand your ministry then
[36:04] you understand that this portion of the
[36:08] word applies to my Ministry of this
[36:10] stage to unlock the next stage because
[36:13] God cannot take you from justification
[36:16] into sanctification if you do not
[36:18] believe him yet because he can't start
[36:22] pulling certain things out of your life
[36:24] if you don't know how to believe him
[36:26] because any body that comes to God must
[36:28] first believe that he is and believe his
[36:32] faith and it's in that stage of
[36:34] justification that somebody comes
[36:36] through the door and you become by faith
[36:40] believing that he has called me because
[36:42] no man can come to me unless the father
[36:45] draws him first and this drawing is
[36:48] justification is you not even yet
[36:51] Sanctified but then when we preaching
[36:54] about your ministry about like you know
[36:56] hey understand you don't need this let's
[36:59] go of this but then you holding up that
[37:02] only shows up that your faith is not
[37:05] anchored yet because Faith must be
[37:08] anchored into the veil believing that
[37:10] the sacrifice that was laay down for
[37:13] that your sins is not your doing but is
[37:17] the work that he did that brings you and
[37:20] gives you the power to be able to walk
[37:23] into your sanctification am because when
[37:26] Martin Luther came he understood he said
[37:29] the just shall live by
[37:32] faith and the believer coming in must
[37:36] have that understanding that it's not me
[37:40] doing then if I am under his
[37:44] leadership if I believe that he is if I
[37:48] believe in the perfect sacrifice that he
[37:51] laid for my life it's no more I that
[37:54] liveth but he that liveth in me and as
[37:58] he is lead leading me he cannot just be
[38:01] your savior but he also has to be your
[38:04] lord and by him not being your lord he
[38:07] can't tell you anything he can save you
[38:10] of course but he has a program for your
[38:13] Earthly Journey because you were elected
[38:17] called anointed and you have to be
[38:20] placed and this placement lays down the
[38:24] program that you have to go through let
[38:26] it be a church
[38:28] let it be uh a nation let it be a a
[38:31] family Let It Be an individual and the
[38:35] understanding on knowing how to access
[38:37] the word and how to approach him because
[38:40] Esther found him herself in under the
[38:43] leadership of Modi
[38:45] she came
[38:47] along understanding
[38:50] believing tell me more let me receive
[38:53] let me have access to this because by
[38:56] the time that mod is taken out of the
[38:58] scene beyond the curon of time now she
[39:02] has to know on how to access on how to
[39:06] dress on how to present herself before
[39:09] the king otherwise it's just a church
[39:12] attendance oh we have to go to church oh
[39:15] I'll show up whenever I want I'll do it
[39:18] this the way I need it to be done no but
[39:20] you as Phillip God can use your ministry
[39:25] leaving the whole congregation and
[39:27] leading you right there in the
[39:29] wilderness for specific work but Phillip
[39:33] is unable to come to that understanding
[39:37] if he had not believed that the word was
[39:40] with God the word was with God and the
[39:42] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[39:47] and this word dwelling Among Us is not
[39:50] some human understanding some human
[39:53] thoughts I say like oh he's a he's from
[39:56] Kentucky oh I don't think like you know
[39:58] he knew what he was talking
[40:00] about that will limit the access to the
[40:04] program of God Amen because faith is the
[40:09] very Foundation of
[40:11] everything because faith is the
[40:13] Revelation Revelation as I've said it
[40:16] before is God the spirit of God coming
[40:18] down in the form of Angel giving us more
[40:22] information in order to understand and
[40:25] better receive it
[40:27] and if we are unable now to stay under
[40:30] that leadership then we find ourselves
[40:33] in all kind of situations I believe this
[40:36] I don't believe this you can't say it
[40:38] that way we only we have only seen it
[40:41] this
[40:43] way but it required
[40:46] that it required the understanding of
[40:48] the
[40:50] sacrifice that's what first king is
[40:52] showing us here Elijah that we have seen
[40:56] coming down going into the cave the Lord
[40:59] tells him what what are you doing here
[41:01] he said I am left all alone the Lord
[41:04] said like that's your mind take away
[41:06] your mind I have a 7,000 more out there
[41:09] that have not bowed down to these things
[41:11] here and we had seen the mystery of je
[41:15] coming in in the form of Communism how
[41:19] we brought it into this day in the
[41:21] history of America that Martin Luther
[41:24] King who was a leader brother Bram show
[41:27] us that this guy who was supposed to be
[41:31] the leader of the crowd but this guy
[41:34] didn't
[41:35] misunderstand the whole portion of the
[41:38] word that there was also Elijah in his
[41:41] day that he is supposed to go and sit
[41:43] under the ministry because himself
[41:46] Elijah wanted to he said if I could just
[41:49] get to speak with him for him to
[41:53] understand for him to see what is
[41:55] happening in the land he said like you
[41:57] know these are spiritual things it
[41:59] requires the Holy Ghost for you to see
[42:02] it that's right because when communism
[42:05] was Finding its way among the people
[42:08] some people say like you know oh this
[42:10] only affected the black families in
[42:13] America some people say like you know oh
[42:15] this is only concerns the
[42:18] minority but until then the world comes
[42:21] the prophet starts showing to us he said
[42:24] like you know 2/3 of the world is under
[42:26] communism
[42:28] to third that was back then and later on
[42:31] you say like the whole world is covered
[42:35] by
[42:36] it and how do we see it brother start
[42:40] showing us as we had seen previously
[42:42] that he start bringing what is communism
[42:45] what is this all about we know that
[42:47] communism brother bam tells us we have
[42:49] the quotation brother bam showing us
[42:51] that communism is Russia will come and
[42:53] strike the us and we'll do all these
[42:55] things here but that was another layer
[42:58] that they start dealing with after
[43:00] 55 because you have to understand that
[43:03] as Elijah is coming through it didn't
[43:07] just come start with the the Teaching
[43:09] Ministry but as is coming through with
[43:13] the Evangelical or healing campaigns
[43:17] throughout those times he's now laying
[43:19] seeds amen he's putting these things in
[43:23] the
[43:24] places so that in proper time
[43:28] those children who says like you know
[43:31] after my departure you start seeing
[43:33] these things will go in those places and
[43:36] start picking them up and say like look
[43:38] where we coming from look at what is
[43:42] happening Among Us pay attention to
[43:46] this let not just have a conceptual
[43:49] mindset of saying we are the bride and
[43:51] all these things while communism has
[43:54] find its way in the church among the
[43:56] people
[43:59] because if we unable to say this then at
[44:03] the end of the day brother Bram says
[44:05] then we find ourselves saying Lord have
[44:07] I not preached have I not like you know
[44:09] been this year say like you know I never
[44:11] knew
[44:12] you what is knowing is coming into is
[44:17] leading and this leading is not you
[44:20] thinking but it's him coming into you
[44:22] and thinking your in your Stead
[44:27] because that's the world we liveing in
[44:28] now I think this way I think this way I
[44:31] have my opinions I I think this way I'm
[44:34] the I I'm entitled to do this I you can
[44:37] tell me what to do that's human
[44:40] perspective of things but then when now
[44:43] we are lifted up in Heavenly places not
[44:45] just in the realm of Revelation but also
[44:48] in Vision we seeing him face to face
[44:51] then it start showing us like you know
[44:53] look at what is happening in the land
[44:56] look at how all this families we last
[44:58] sermon we saw it but said like you know
[45:01] we are the reason why that our old the
[45:05] standard of the church is broken
[45:07] down because we have taken our own
[45:10] mindset and put it mix it up with the
[45:12] word thinking that we have received the
[45:16] word but we are only tearing it so that
[45:19] it fits our condition amen we find
[45:24] quotations of course oh look at look at
[45:27] brother brother brunham and sister mid
[45:29] the way they're dressing of course
[45:31] you'll find it because your mind is able
[45:35] to still work and be able to find those
[45:38] examples but
[45:41] until the five requirements to receive
[45:44] the revelations are
[45:46] met then now you able now to start
[45:49] seeing it's not you
[45:51] thinking it's not you Desiring for you
[45:54] to receive it the way you thought to be
[45:57] received right because when he comes
[46:01] down to
[46:02] you he he start now showing you places
[46:06] that you never thought to be looked at
[46:09] before because what we have known all
[46:12] this time about communism it's just like
[46:14] you know Russia will come Russia will do
[46:16] this but brother say we are whole bunch
[46:18] of
[46:20] communist and Martin Luther King who was
[46:24] supposed to be the leader this is not a
[46:28] pagan he's not a
[46:30] backslider this is a
[46:33] minister with a big audience this is a
[46:36] father a mother this is a
[46:40] pastor leading a church but not knowing
[46:44] that it is communist inspired
[46:49] amen and while all these things are
[46:52] standing before us we should be
[46:55] conscious what we doing what are we
[46:57] following where are we going and that's
[47:01] why the Lord by his grace who loves
[47:03] these people is said like you know let
[47:06] me show you these things come up up a
[47:08] little
[47:09] higher let me show you the things that
[47:12] to
[47:13] come but then it requires these people
[47:16] now to be obedient amen and that's why
[47:20] he says here it said like you know when
[47:22] Elijah departed it said like you know
[47:25] come let me th the mantle upon
[47:28] you now it's Elijah's choice now to
[47:32] either take the
[47:34] mantle or to reject it or to tailor it
[47:38] according to his own
[47:40] faith because usually when the mental
[47:43] comes upon us it's
[47:45] big it doesn't feed us and if it's too
[47:49] small that means we're
[47:52] big oh I know I I know the whole word
[47:55] I've read all the message
[47:57] are you you can't tell me anything of
[48:00] course you're too
[48:03] big but then for you to be able to sit
[48:06] at the table right the robe must
[48:09] fit you must be able to be anointed by
[48:12] the
[48:13] Rob but then if we bring our own Rob to
[48:17] or find our own ways to get access into
[48:21] the banquet then they will ask you but
[48:24] the robe that we supposed to have in
[48:26] this part
[48:28] brings everybody to the same
[48:30] level how come you still think as a
[48:35] communist how come you think that you
[48:38] still like Nimrod lifting yourself above
[48:41] the stars of
[48:42] God how come you are found in this
[48:46] Gathering and you're still despising
[48:51] others because the fellow didn't
[48:54] understand the law of faith
[48:58] didn't understand the perfect
[49:01] sacrifice because he thought that the
[49:03] fact that he comes into the congregation
[49:07] because remember in job one it shows us
[49:09] that the fellow came into the presence
[49:12] of
[49:13] God where you from said I was wandering
[49:16] the earth oh so you just wandering left
[49:18] and right and you still able to come
[49:20] into His presence of course you
[49:23] can you've been running back and forth
[49:25] and without prayer without without
[49:27] anything and you just show up to church
[49:28] of course you
[49:32] will because we're two or three are
[49:35] guarded in his name is in the midst
[49:37] thereof that's right and when he's in
[49:39] the midst thereof the four fellow that
[49:41] comes over just wondering without
[49:43] understanding he finds himself like
[49:46] Moses before the the the the burning
[49:48] bush I'll just come however I want with
[49:50] my sandals on I with my ideas and I'll
[49:53] just do whatever I want he said no
[49:57] that that's not how you access the
[49:59] word that's not how you come into His
[50:02] presence you need to remove your
[50:05] sandals you need to remove
[50:08] this because when you understand that
[50:10] hey my justification is not because I've
[50:13] done
[50:14] anything but because he had done the
[50:17] work and I am accepted in the
[50:20] Beloved and being accepted in the
[50:22] Beloved is not oh you know I've read all
[50:25] this quotation left and right I have my
[50:27] quotations on my sermon I'll come this
[50:30] way and I'll present it this way
[50:33] no he like to skip on the
[50:36] mountains start from the first first
[50:38] quotation jump to the last one and flip
[50:41] it around and before you know it oh I
[50:43] never seen it that way even even if I
[50:45] had prepared a
[50:46] sermon but then
[50:48] intellectualism right is
[50:51] Introduction development give examples
[50:55] conclusions let let us
[50:57] pray that's human
[51:00] mind but he wants to skip on the
[51:03] mountains he wants to address the
[51:05] younger ones he wants to address the
[51:08] older ones he wants to do the things
[51:11] that the way he wants
[51:13] it if you come with your prayer card in
[51:16] your hand he wants to leave you there he
[51:19] wants to address the need of the one the
[51:21] other one pulling by
[51:23] faith because he's believing
[51:27] but he faith is not still not yet there
[51:30] andam say many times it's even the
[51:34] unbelievers that get healed more than
[51:37] the
[51:38] Believers because they don't understand
[51:40] the approach they don't understand how
[51:43] to access the
[51:45] word it's not human intellect oh he said
[51:48] this quotation how do I understand this
[51:50] does disconnect to this year no right
[51:54] faith is the Revelation amen and it
[51:56] takes you up there yes
[52:02] sir and Elijah came he found him looked
[52:07] at him said what are we doing here I
[52:10] said like you know follow
[52:11] me and he understood they need to go and
[52:15] separate himself from his
[52:18] families from his old
[52:21] culture oh we me Mexicans we do this and
[52:24] this is the way we've been doing it for
[52:26] centuries like you know we Africans and
[52:28] all this this is what we seen with
[52:34] Nimrod coming and conquering the land
[52:37] and cultures and all these things here
[52:40] oh you congol you play this music here
[52:43] I'm thankful to the Lord that he's
[52:45] opening even further these things into
[52:47] music I never seen music like
[52:50] that I said even in the church people
[52:53] playing all this kind of music but
[52:55] bringing all type of anointing things of
[53:01] course even the prophet would say I said
[53:05] I'm so grateful for you Spanish people I
[53:08] don't even understand the words but I
[53:10] know the spirit is Right
[53:15] amen
[53:17] what with that way of playing
[53:20] music and the colored woman came and
[53:23] start beating the whole thing as a
[53:25] Baptist man mindset
[53:27] Baptist mindset they said like you know
[53:29] oh look he he she want they want to turn
[53:32] my church into a
[53:34] Tavern but before he knows it the spirit
[53:37] comes like you know stand up go up there
[53:39] he start he started dancing with her in
[53:42] the
[53:44] church I said like you know all these
[53:46] are quotations that we
[53:48] have but then when it start opening it
[53:51] then it start showing us even
[53:55] further how come the fellow guy who
[54:00] rides peace in the
[54:02] valley and he sends you to go look at
[54:05] the life of the one who wrot it and you
[54:08] get
[54:10] stumbled said like this is the one who
[54:13] wrote peace in the
[54:16] valley how come the Lord just didn't go
[54:19] and use one of the cleanest and purest
[54:22] person right there in the church
[54:28] how come Amazing Grace was G was written
[54:31] by a a person that was going out there
[54:35] and buying slave and selling them
[54:40] away but then if we bunch of communist
[54:43] you know oh these people with all the
[54:44] racism oh you know people this is that
[54:47] they say like you know because you don't
[54:48] know how to access the
[54:52] word because we don't know how to access
[54:54] the word
[54:58] as I say like you know racism in America
[55:00] is one of the greatest issue people have
[55:04] it in in all types of
[55:08] forms but then the Lord said you know
[55:10] don't worry it's
[55:13] communism because they think because
[55:16] Fascism and nism will be swallowed up I
[55:20] said it be
[55:22] before because when I'm if I'm a
[55:25] communist
[55:27] how just say like you know oh we are all
[55:29] together everything is good by God's
[55:31] grace and all these things but
[55:32] underneath I'm a fashist I'm a
[55:37] nist that's what the word is showing us
[55:40] and this F communism brother Bram
[55:43] brought it even further and said like
[55:45] you know look how these
[55:48] mothers they're leaving their
[55:51] babies
[55:54] to the babysit in the name of having a
[55:59] false hope of a better
[56:03] life they go to work they work so
[56:07] hard but before they know it that whole
[56:10] generation is all destroyed but what I'm
[56:14] saying you leave those CH those children
[56:16] alone you find that very soon they
[56:19] become a bunch of
[56:22] neurotics but she couldn't see that in
[56:25] her Ministry because she couldn't
[56:27] believe him at
[56:30] first because she thought that I'll just
[56:34] go to church and I'll just listen to a
[56:36] sermon I'll pick up some quotations and
[56:39] and defend my position to go to work
[56:42] without understanding her
[56:44] Ministry without seeing how communism
[56:48] will come in
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:51] today because the definition of
[56:54] communism is
[56:57] all of us classless people no God wants
[57:01] classes right that's
[57:03] right he he wants the
[57:06] archangels the
[57:08] cherubin and everybody
[57:11] else the highest Authority the pastor in
[57:14] the
[57:15] church he wants the
[57:18] deacons he wants the
[57:20] ashers he wants all those class of
[57:23] people in order to bring out his program
[57:26] right that's
[57:28] right oh Pastor what you say I don't
[57:30] believe
[57:31] you oh brother I don't I don't look at
[57:34] it that way of
[57:37] course until you get a hold of him then
[57:40] he will start proving all
[57:42] things he'll bring all scriptures to
[57:45] your remembrance thank you Lord it's not
[57:48] just a part of
[57:49] it because when we take a part of it we
[57:52] run with it but you don't
[57:54] see all the distractions that you're
[57:58] doing because of a false ham says
[58:01] because of the extra dollar she's
[58:03] looking
[58:04] for before she knows it she found
[58:07] herself like you know doing all kind of
[58:09] things oh I work too you should also
[58:13] help with the
[58:15] dishes amen but then when she was taking
[58:18] her
[58:20] vow in The Vow didn't say that you she
[58:23] was going to do that
[58:29] but then if that be
[58:31] true for her to be doing be found in
[58:34] that position then she had to know how
[58:38] to bring all scriptures into
[58:42] fulfillment because Esther labored after
[58:46] the Reapers with the Reapers but as soon
[58:51] she found herself at the feet of Bas he
[58:54] said I cast all my car
[58:56] upon
[58:57] you accessing the word not just
[59:00] quotations like I can do this I can do
[59:03] that I know brother say this oh we know
[59:05] you
[59:07] know amen but knowing how to access the
[59:12] word and it doesn't come
[59:15] overnight it doesn't come overnight but
[59:18] then we're bringing faith in his
[59:21] place so that each one of us will be
[59:24] able to go back say Lord you have a
[59:27] program and I need to access it and I
[59:31] believe the perfect sacrifice and this
[59:33] sacrifice Will Lead Me Faithfully into
[59:36] your
[59:37] program because he said to I believe Mar
[59:41] said m m you always carried by all kind
[59:45] of work and
[59:46] things but she has chosen the proper
[59:49] thing you need to have the most needful
[59:52] thing sit down at the feet and learn
[59:57] sit down and be able to know how to
[59:59] access the
[1:00:00] word Abraham I'm giving you the
[1:00:03] land understand on how to explore the
[1:00:06] land how to access the
[1:00:09] word and he wants you there at his feet
[1:00:13] that's right he want to there like John
[1:00:16] on his bosom learning
[1:00:21] dly and Elisha the same he come in his
[1:00:25] presence
[1:00:26] so like you know understand all this
[1:00:30] nimod
[1:00:32] series let me now go after you and the
[1:00:35] Bible says that he ministered unto
[1:00:40] him he
[1:00:42] labored with him because he
[1:00:46] knows I've seen this fellow's
[1:00:50] ministry i' I have the 1200
[1:00:53] tapes I can see where he start
[1:00:56] Ed how he came about and all these
[1:00:59] things I've heard the demonstration on
[1:01:01] the
[1:01:02] mountain are all this false denomination
[1:01:05] all these things were brought
[1:01:07] down how the the prophecy of the seventh
[1:01:10] Vision came about how things are going
[1:01:13] to
[1:01:14] happen I'm seeing how all these things
[1:01:16] are happening but then what about
[1:01:20] me oh I know Russia is doing this I know
[1:01:22] the United States is doomed what about
[1:01:24] me
[1:01:26] what am I
[1:01:29] doing am I just going to church am I
[1:01:31] just embracing another sermon and say oh
[1:01:34] I I heard of someone today oh God bless
[1:01:36] you brother oh brother didn't understand
[1:01:38] this
[1:01:39] here we become acquainted with it we
[1:01:43] want it intellectual we want it in a
[1:01:46] form of like you know amen glory be to
[1:01:48] God Amen we are the bride but then when
[1:01:50] we turn we turn into communism and we're
[1:01:53] destroying the Next Generation
[1:01:56] without even realizing
[1:01:59] it but then when we are
[1:02:02] conscious just like Joshua say like I am
[1:02:05] my household We Shall Serve the Lord and
[1:02:08] dis serving like
[1:02:11] Elisha sitting at his
[1:02:13] feet understanding what what are we
[1:02:15] doing at what season what what is
[1:02:18] happening in the land just as our
[1:02:22] precious pastors have been showing it
[1:02:25] all over the world world and the the the
[1:02:27] the all the elders were going and stuff
[1:02:30] why are they leaving
[1:02:32] us for us to go back into
[1:02:36] Egypt for us to cross the Jordan under
[1:02:38] sanctification and say oh we are satisfi
[1:02:42] this journey oh I don't cheat to my I
[1:02:45] don't cheat my husband I'm faithful to
[1:02:47] my wife and all this year I don't think
[1:02:50] really going into the promised land is
[1:02:53] necessary for me to go in like the tribe
[1:02:55] of of done
[1:02:57] no because we understand God's program
[1:03:02] came from Genesis 15 I said come out
[1:03:05] I'll show you the land I'm laying the
[1:03:07] sacrifice I'm giving you the alliance
[1:03:10] I'm giving you the promise that this
[1:03:12] whole land have I given to
[1:03:15] thee and this seed shall possess this
[1:03:18] whole land do you know the
[1:03:23] land do we know the land question as a
[1:03:26] deacon do I know my
[1:03:28] land holding the mystery of the
[1:03:34] faith I am only a deacon for this such a
[1:03:38] group I am only a minister for such a
[1:03:42] group if it's not that nism and fascism
[1:03:46] tell me what it
[1:03:48] is tell me not that tell me what it is
[1:03:51] because all these things we see them in
[1:03:54] the word
[1:03:56] and then when we lift our faces then we
[1:03:58] understand who is who
[1:04:01] amen because William brandham stood on
[1:04:04] the pulit and said like you know I'm
[1:04:05] looking at you I don't know who you are
[1:04:09] I don't know where you came from I don't
[1:04:11] know what's wrong with you but I'm
[1:04:14] waiting for him to come down and when he
[1:04:16] comes down he will tell me exactly
[1:04:19] what's going on with
[1:04:20] you and when the word opens up what do
[1:04:24] we see
[1:04:27] we want to see
[1:04:28] Jesus in all the
[1:04:30] forms as a mother we want to see him as
[1:04:34] a father we want to see him because the
[1:04:36] word will respond to the word but then
[1:04:39] if the church has to move according to
[1:04:41] the
[1:04:43] word it has to respond with the word
[1:04:46] with everything that's in the
[1:04:49] word Lord you know I'm being in this
[1:04:52] season for this reason
[1:04:55] but I know the process that will take
[1:04:58] you have to know let me not get into
[1:05:00] another angle as I was showing it to the
[1:05:02] brothers in uh presc last Sunday I said
[1:05:08] like you know you have to know if it's
[1:05:10] your first age your second your third
[1:05:12] and your fourth and the fifth and if you
[1:05:14] under Reformation of things you have to
[1:05:21] know that's why Psalm 957 say for he is
[1:05:26] our God and we are the people of his
[1:05:29] pasture and the Sheep of his hand he's
[1:05:32] leading us today if ye will hear his
[1:05:37] voice Harden not your heart as in the
[1:05:41] provocation as in the day of the
[1:05:43] Temptation in the
[1:05:45] wilderness he's showing them I have a
[1:05:48] program I brought you
[1:05:51] out but you need to listen amen you need
[1:05:55] to to pay attention to the word am watch
[1:05:58] the
[1:05:59] word but we want to show watch the
[1:06:02] statistics and who pays the ties better
[1:06:04] who doesn't pay the ties and all these
[1:06:07] things here but then I'll read you the
[1:06:09] quotation but says that until you get
[1:06:11] into that place then now you start
[1:06:13] seeing things differently than they you
[1:06:15] the way you used to be because that's
[1:06:18] basically the whole
[1:06:20] responsibility that's basically the
[1:06:22] whole point of the whole series is to
[1:06:25] bring
[1:06:26] Elisha to understand his
[1:06:30] position what he's supposed to do and
[1:06:32] how he's supposed to address it but
[1:06:34] before he's able to do that he needs to
[1:06:38] learn himself first on how either to
[1:06:40] shrink in the robe or grow in the
[1:06:45] robe because when you get fitted in the
[1:06:47] robe then the robe now start moving
[1:06:50] that's because a little child you give
[1:06:52] him your his father's shirt he will wear
[1:06:55] it it's very big make a step and then it
[1:06:58] start falling into it right you just
[1:07:02] like you know putting out coat and quot
[1:07:04] this and qu that you know oh Pastor
[1:07:06] don't believe this pastor don't believe
[1:07:07] that before you know it you hurting
[1:07:09] yourself amen butam is wrong here we
[1:07:13] don't really believe this here he he
[1:07:15] still making mistakes oh keep having
[1:07:17] your mind before you know it you on the
[1:07:20] first Pew middle Pew back outside there
[1:07:24] and you on the streets that's right it's
[1:07:26] a simple
[1:07:29] principle it's either we moving
[1:07:32] forward or we try to think that you know
[1:07:35] we're progressing at a regressing
[1:07:39] rate amen I come to church I listen but
[1:07:42] I don't really obey it we are
[1:07:45] progressing but a regression
[1:07:48] rate I don't really like when I listen
[1:07:51] to this today I don't really think like
[1:07:54] you know that tipe is really has a has a
[1:07:56] clear
[1:07:58] sound it's not really clear I don't want
[1:08:01] to put myself into
[1:08:03] that but then when now the sacrifice is
[1:08:07] enjoyed to labor to stay under it then
[1:08:12] it start opening up Elijah Elisha I can
[1:08:17] see Elisha watching him every move he
[1:08:21] made that's the only way he was ever
[1:08:23] going to get the blessing he was getting
[1:08:27] the blessing is when he watched
[1:08:30] him keeping his eyes upon
[1:08:34] him he said kept his eyes upon him keep
[1:08:37] your eyes on Christ don't look at how
[1:08:40] don't look to how sick you are or what
[1:08:42] the doctor said look at what Christ said
[1:08:45] keep your eye keep your eye wi right
[1:08:48] there believe what he
[1:08:53] said he wants that faith
[1:08:58] in because even William
[1:09:01] Bram he told
[1:09:03] him what are you waiting for a vision
[1:09:06] for the whole point of your ministry of
[1:09:10] Malachi
[1:09:12] 4 it's not that I will send you Elijah
[1:09:15] the prophet to start telling you Vision
[1:09:17] Vision
[1:09:18] Visions I will send you Elijah to do
[1:09:21] what to restore the faith
[1:09:26] and he wants people to believe
[1:09:28] him the very same principle that started
[1:09:31] the journey is the very same principle
[1:09:34] that will finish it am you came by faith
[1:09:39] and You raptured by faith I believe I'll
[1:09:42] be there I'm saved by faith I'm
[1:09:45] following his program by
[1:09:47] faith it's not a statistic like you know
[1:09:50] I see my children this way oh my
[1:09:52] children are wearing Dre and my oh those
[1:09:55] oh the the neighbors I don't want you
[1:09:57] with the neighbors you
[1:10:00] know but ROM say the Lord has ways to
[1:10:04] show me
[1:10:06] things you say oh just be kind with them
[1:10:10] just say God bless you and stop
[1:10:12] there and those same Spirits are still
[1:10:16] around us today
[1:10:19] amen inside we
[1:10:22] holding
[1:10:23] fascism Nation
[1:10:26] ISM but we are just
[1:10:29] communist but then when the word comes
[1:10:32] down then it start showing
[1:10:34] us watch here my brother watch there my
[1:10:38] sister welome this place here because
[1:10:41] this is limiting your access to the word
[1:10:45] you're not believing
[1:10:48] him butam says I try to speed up so I
[1:10:53] can close here in a little bit
[1:10:56] it says this is necessary in order to
[1:10:58] study and understand the rest of the
[1:11:00] Revelation for out of the ages comes the
[1:11:03] seals and out of the seals comes the
[1:11:05] trumpets and out of the trumpets comes
[1:11:07] the veils like the birst of a Roman
[1:11:11] Candle the church ages comes with a
[1:11:14] mighty illumination without which there
[1:11:17] could be no further
[1:11:18] light he's giving us the key on how to
[1:11:22] access the word
[1:11:26] we have all the 1200
[1:11:30] messages but we need to know how to
[1:11:34] access the
[1:11:36] word that's why we have all these
[1:11:41] doctrines and people who grew under
[1:11:44] those doctrines we believe this way and
[1:11:48] times you say like you know have you
[1:11:50] ever taken the
[1:11:52] time to sit down with him
[1:11:55] to get into the
[1:11:57] field to labor after the
[1:12:01] Reapers because when we labor after the
[1:12:03] Reapers you are hearing me
[1:12:06] tonight but that's not
[1:12:08] enough that will not cover everything
[1:12:11] but I'm pointing to specific places to
[1:12:15] awaken our mind that our spiritual
[1:12:19] laziness should not be justified to the
[1:12:22] fact that we going to church
[1:12:27] but it should awaken us to
[1:12:29] labor because when it comes and say like
[1:12:32] you know who is the lady it's said like
[1:12:34] you know oh I've heard the great report
[1:12:37] of you you come to church that's fine
[1:12:40] but let me take you where to find the
[1:12:44] bread and the
[1:12:45] vinegar watch the principle every single
[1:12:49] person that ever come into the presence
[1:12:51] of him it takes him first to the
[1:12:54] sacrifice
[1:12:58] Elisha comes to the
[1:13:02] sacrifice he's able to walk away from
[1:13:06] all his doctrines and culture and all
[1:13:09] these things based upon the
[1:13:14] sacrifice Revelation comes first by
[1:13:17] opening with the
[1:13:21] sacrifice Leviticus 23 opens up with the
[1:13:28] sacrifice Exodus 3 begins with the
[1:13:33] sacrifice and this sacrifice is the same
[1:13:37] sacrifice that now start changing
[1:13:40] forms we call it in one stage the first
[1:13:44] pool we call it into another the second
[1:13:47] pool we call it the third pool but it's
[1:13:50] still the same person but just revealing
[1:13:54] even more information giving us more
[1:13:58] understanding but then it requires Faith
[1:14:01] to believe him to follow him and he says
[1:14:05] that these Church ages because
[1:14:09] Revelation opens up first I am
[1:14:13] Jesus who was alive dead but live
[1:14:17] forever
[1:14:18] more and this living but says on his
[1:14:22] Earthly Journey it couldn't tell because
[1:14:25] the disciple wanted to
[1:14:27] know when are these things going to come
[1:14:30] not even the son
[1:14:32] knows because it is a mystery hidden but
[1:14:37] bam says this was not revealed to him
[1:14:40] until his death and Resurrection now the
[1:14:44] whole thing comes open right then the
[1:14:48] whole world sits down and say like you
[1:14:50] know John had probably had had bad
[1:14:52] supper the things that he wor he didn't
[1:14:55] didn't know what he was talking about
[1:14:56] but then glory be to God that we receive
[1:14:59] Elijah who comes to us and tells us
[1:15:02] begins with the church ages without
[1:15:05] which there could be no further light
[1:15:09] amen but nobody knows how to access it
[1:15:12] come down and sit down let me teach
[1:15:14] you and that teaching says like you know
[1:15:17] I want people to have this
[1:15:20] book the angel said like you know the
[1:15:22] first sentence on the tapes we have we
[1:15:24] are we testing some new
[1:15:28] gadgets why people need to have
[1:15:31] access to the
[1:15:33] material to the message so they know how
[1:15:37] to go through it because in many places
[1:15:40] that he went Africa and uh uh Germany
[1:15:43] and Canada and many of these places we
[1:15:46] don't have the
[1:15:47] recordings but it pleased the Lord to
[1:15:51] know exactly what we will need
[1:15:55] have them recorded in whatever shape of
[1:15:58] form whatever state that there is now he
[1:16:02] wants you now to get to
[1:16:04] work he wants you not to get to work
[1:16:07] you're not getting into the field just
[1:16:08] like anyhow we need to have the pieces
[1:16:11] of the puzzle but we also need the
[1:16:14] picture of the
[1:16:17] puzzle because at the end when you put
[1:16:20] all the pieces together it must reflect
[1:16:23] the picture of the
[1:16:26] puzzle otherwise we ending up with
[1:16:29] people like I don't believe this this
[1:16:31] message is wrong oh that means you never
[1:16:34] had the picture to begin with and it's
[1:16:36] giving us that the picture he said out
[1:16:39] of the edges comes the seals out of the
[1:16:42] seals the trumpet out the trumpets the
[1:16:44] the
[1:16:46] veils it's not like after the church
[1:16:49] ages you have no after the seals out of
[1:16:52] the ages you have the seals amen out of
[1:16:56] the seals you have the
[1:16:58] trumpets then we start throwing things
[1:17:01] left and right and this and that and but
[1:17:03] by God's grace he's giving us the light
[1:17:06] he's giving us the key he said like you
[1:17:08] know otherwi there could be no further
[1:17:09] light he said light upon light follows
[1:17:12] until the whole of the Revelation opens
[1:17:16] up wide before our wondering
[1:17:20] eyes as you we are growing under the
[1:17:23] mantle
[1:17:25] you say I never looked at it this before
[1:17:28] I never seen communism this way before
[1:17:32] because is opening the whole
[1:17:34] Revelation it's not just speaking about
[1:17:37] Russia being commun the communist
[1:17:39] country or Cuba being the communist
[1:17:42] country but then it's start now showing
[1:17:44] us like you look out the whole
[1:17:48] world now we call it into a feminist
[1:17:51] movement the place of the woman and all
[1:17:54] the these things here said like you know
[1:17:56] the place of a woman is in the kitchen
[1:17:58] and then they get all bumped up say oh
[1:18:01] you telling a woman a modern woman to
[1:18:04] stay in the kitchen because you don't
[1:18:06] sit at his feet to understand that the
[1:18:09] kitchen is a Ministry
[1:18:13] amen because this I'm I can't go into
[1:18:17] all these places but I'm just giving us
[1:18:20] the key to be able to sit at his feet
[1:18:24] and start
[1:18:25] drinking it down into each one of us
[1:18:29] into our
[1:18:32] Ministries because brother bham shows us
[1:18:36] clearly Suzanne Wesley with 17
[1:18:40] children she just didn't sit there just
[1:18:43] cleaning the dishes and all these things
[1:18:45] come
[1:18:47] on and Bam shows us clearly that today
[1:18:50] you have all these tools to help you and
[1:18:53] stuff but we unable to spend more hours
[1:18:56] than she
[1:19:00] did that means we just didn't sit we
[1:19:03] were too big to fit under the robe and
[1:19:06] we couldn't see how the place of the
[1:19:08] woman is in the kitchen it is a
[1:19:11] statement hard but to the Sons and
[1:19:13] Daughters of God they able to catch it
[1:19:16] and Martin Luther King of the family
[1:19:19] should be now able to see that I say
[1:19:21] like you know no no no no no no no
[1:19:23] no it's not not despising you he's not
[1:19:27] hating you but he's showing you a
[1:19:30] mystery only given to those who have the
[1:19:33] five requirements to receive the
[1:19:37] Revelation because these five
[1:19:39] requirements gives the people the
[1:19:41] ability to to assess themselves and when
[1:19:45] they understand that I don't have the
[1:19:48] Revelation where does these things come
[1:19:50] from and where are we going with all
[1:19:52] these things then they get to work like
[1:19:55] Elisha said tell me not to leave you let
[1:20:00] me listen to a tape every day let me Le
[1:20:02] read a chapter a chapter will turn into
[1:20:04] a whole book a whole book will just turn
[1:20:07] into a whole study because Elisha is
[1:20:10] trying to grow Elisha is trying to to uh
[1:20:13] uh to lose
[1:20:16] weight so he can be able to see Jesus
[1:20:19] and his program and that's the way we
[1:20:23] are able to preach these things the way
[1:20:25] they are we preaching them not as based
[1:20:28] on human ability that oh brother it's
[1:20:31] your experience no it's not about
[1:20:33] experience I'm on my probably my second
[1:20:37] quot why because he knows with
[1:20:43] certainty how where the children needs
[1:20:46] to be
[1:20:47] found the access to the
[1:20:50] word it's not just like you know coming
[1:20:52] to church you hear something new oh I
[1:20:54] never SE see it like that no it's not
[1:20:55] about never seeing it like that but when
[1:20:57] you have the key Jesus Christ is same
[1:20:59] yesterday to end forever butam calls it
[1:21:02] the Keystone to the
[1:21:05] Bible I'm calling it the access to the
[1:21:08] word he calls it the Keystone to the
[1:21:11] Bible Abel calls it the Revelation
[1:21:14] catching knowing on how to access
[1:21:18] him and when we are able to access him
[1:21:21] then we see the whole PN of the word
[1:21:25] the same quotations the other person is
[1:21:28] blinded by it but the other one is
[1:21:30] quickened by
[1:21:32] it the other one knows how to find a
[1:21:34] position she knows she the church she in
[1:21:38] the church men and
[1:21:40] women right she knows how to access the
[1:21:44] word by knowing how to access the word
[1:21:47] every single time that the ministry come
[1:21:50] on the pulpit she's able to access it
[1:21:53] right away she knows that oh this is my
[1:21:55] focus right here she's not sitting here
[1:21:58] you heard the preach about you you need
[1:22:00] to change
[1:22:02] no no but she's able to understand like
[1:22:08] oh this is not my next stage I haven't
[1:22:11] been working
[1:22:12] enough let me labor more like in the
[1:22:16] book of Ezra so they labored on the on
[1:22:18] the land they labeled on the
[1:22:21] wall one to with The Sword and the other
[1:22:24] the the uh one hand with the tool and
[1:22:25] the other with the
[1:22:28] sword they're laboring from the rising
[1:22:32] of the Moon of of the sun until the
[1:22:35] stars appear the whole program is before
[1:22:39] them because Joshua understands say I am
[1:22:43] in the work I am working if the sun has
[1:22:46] to sit down now and these demons will
[1:22:50] come will go and strengthen themselves
[1:22:52] and come back again right
[1:22:55] I hope we understanding the principle
[1:22:57] that I'm laying
[1:23:00] here it's not just about quotations left
[1:23:02] quotations right oh you people believe
[1:23:05] this no it's it's not about them people
[1:23:07] believing that but then let me just get
[1:23:09] to that quote so we can close time is
[1:23:18] gone elishah and Elisha and the only way
[1:23:21] to that that you can you can tonight
[1:23:25] become alive of faith in God is DED out
[1:23:27] to yourself to yourself and symptoms
[1:23:30] everything around you and become alive
[1:23:33] die out die uh die out to to symptoms
[1:23:36] die out to circumstances die out to
[1:23:38] everything else and become alive in
[1:23:40] Christ and when they got to the Jordan
[1:23:43] I'll I'll skip this
[1:23:50] year next paragraph 41 well you
[1:23:56] now brother I'll go somewhere in the
[1:23:58] middle there uh few lines before the red
[1:24:00] line where we are lighted there now
[1:24:03] brother if you don't see Divine Healing
[1:24:05] you don't see the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost you don't see the mighty move of
[1:24:09] the of the spirit of God just as you
[1:24:12] might not see one quotation that
[1:24:14] quotation how does it apply look at how
[1:24:16] brother bam is giving us the tools on to
[1:24:19] be able to access it he said the spirit
[1:24:22] move the spirit of God moving in uh in
[1:24:24] the last stage here just get in the
[1:24:27] spirit one time and you will see things
[1:24:31] things will be revealed to you that's
[1:24:35] right don't come here in a humanistic
[1:24:38] realm like who who's preaching today ah
[1:24:41] I don't like him I'm not
[1:24:45] going get in the
[1:24:48] spirit and things will become be
[1:24:51] revealed to you the same Minister who is
[1:24:54] a stumbling block to you the next time
[1:24:56] like you know my brother I'm happy to
[1:24:58] see
[1:24:59] you why because you have died out to
[1:25:02] your own self now you are under his
[1:25:05] shadow like Mary how this thing will be
[1:25:09] the Holy Spirit shall overshadow
[1:25:12] you overshadowing brother Bram says it's
[1:25:16] him like in Mary it comes
[1:25:23] in it's it's not that he preaches good I
[1:25:27] understand him better no you should come
[1:25:30] to that level and he want you there that
[1:25:34] when the word comes out you able to see
[1:25:36] him at all
[1:25:40] times you want to see him at all
[1:25:44] times when he wakes up in the morning
[1:25:47] she's looking at him what are you
[1:25:48] wearing today I'm putting a blue tie
[1:25:51] white shirt and all this oh this is good
[1:25:53] and when you know that he's putting
[1:25:56] those rugged shoes and all that oh he's
[1:25:58] about to
[1:26:01] work when you see him putting the gloves
[1:26:03] and trying to reach to the oven oh he is
[1:26:06] about
[1:26:09] cooking when you see him going into the
[1:26:11] certain areas with with the gun you know
[1:26:14] oh he's about to
[1:26:16] hunt you should know him has is
[1:26:19] displaying himself he's keeping on the
[1:26:23] mountains he's changing forms is
[1:26:26] bringing the focus on certain areas to
[1:26:29] to bring the awakeness but then when
[1:26:31] it's not that we unable to access the
[1:26:36] word we just look at him has like you
[1:26:39] know oh the next fellow who's preaching
[1:26:41] brother Ron okay God bless you I'll be
[1:26:43] there oh brother S I don't really he
[1:26:46] doesn't speak good English why should
[1:26:47] you let him preach and all these things
[1:26:50] here but then he chose in this last day
[1:26:54] to use a man with the lowest education
[1:26:57] than all of us to bring all these
[1:27:00] Mysteries so that when it is a stumbling
[1:27:03] block to you that you want it to be a
[1:27:05] perfect English then you miss him right
[1:27:08] away that's
[1:27:10] right yet he also uses people like Luke
[1:27:14] like
[1:27:15] Paul who had went higher studies speaks
[1:27:19] better English and all this all the
[1:27:20] grammar in
[1:27:22] place but he wants you to know how to
[1:27:26] access
[1:27:27] him he wants you to know when you look
[1:27:31] at his eyes when he's in Fire and doing
[1:27:34] all these things you know this is not
[1:27:36] the time to approach him this is the
[1:27:38] time to stay
[1:27:40] quiet and afterward that's what na told
[1:27:44] her he said like you know disturb not
[1:27:46] the man until he has finished to eat and
[1:27:50] drink then access him
[1:27:54] it is the principle of the word that I'm
[1:27:56] showing that all these things that has
[1:27:59] to follow I don't have to sit here and
[1:28:00] say like you know oh you the young
[1:28:02] people you have to respect your parents
[1:28:04] and you the grown-ups and all this
[1:28:05] things no we're using the language of
[1:28:07] the word am and each one of us are able
[1:28:11] now to take it
[1:28:14] down because the same
[1:28:18] electricity is powering a lot of things
[1:28:21] here the same electricity is giving us
[1:28:23] life
[1:28:26] the same electricity is giving power to
[1:28:28] the
[1:28:30] mic but it is say still the same
[1:28:34] electricity and it said you know I don't
[1:28:36] really like the
[1:28:37] light I don't I I don't like the keys
[1:28:41] you know the drums the way they played I
[1:28:43] don't really like it in reality he's
[1:28:47] standing there like in the book of
[1:28:49] Samuel it said like you know Samuel it's
[1:28:51] not you that have rejected they've
[1:28:54] rejected me that's
[1:28:56] right and he wants us to know how to
[1:29:00] access
[1:29:01] him because when he comes down we are
[1:29:06] conscious what are we doing where we do
[1:29:09] going amen time is up but God's
[1:29:14] grace the access to the word out of the
[1:29:17] ages comes the seals out of the seals
[1:29:21] the trumpets it's not just a mere
[1:29:23] quotation
[1:29:25] the access of the word
[1:29:27] am because we're hearing every time a
[1:29:30] minister comes in oh I get inspired so
[1:29:35] quick when the minister start you read
[1:29:37] the quotation you you able to see where
[1:29:40] is going with the
[1:29:42] sermon where did you get that quotation
[1:29:44] did baram really say that where is the
[1:29:48] spirit get into let us get into the
[1:29:51] spirit musicians if you come come step
[1:29:53] forward let us step into the
[1:29:55] spirit and by stepping into the spirit
[1:29:59] we are able to start seeing Jesus and
[1:30:03] his program because this program has
[1:30:05] never changed that's from eternity back
[1:30:09] to Eternity and in between our Earthly
[1:30:13] journey is giving us experiences but
[1:30:16] these experiences are laid down in the
[1:30:18] Bible laid down in the
[1:30:20] message with to people with common
[1:30:24] passions like
[1:30:26] us and these people Elijah walking in
[1:30:30] with Hunger you will go through the same
[1:30:33] thing the economy will suffer you
[1:30:36] sometimes you lose some money
[1:30:40] sometimes but he said I have prepared a
[1:30:44] woman to take care of
[1:30:47] you if he had taken care of him is he
[1:30:50] not going to take care of me today amen
[1:30:53] what why do we worry why are we afraid
[1:30:56] why do we Panic of our situations oh my
[1:30:59] children don't listen bring them to the
[1:31:01] word we see look at William brandham
[1:31:03] with Billy
[1:31:06] Paul he's giving us examples every day
[1:31:10] revealing himself unto us well but the
[1:31:13] prophet was uh uh he was seeing Vision
[1:31:15] it was easy for him to know what was
[1:31:17] happening with the children he says but
[1:31:19] the Lord might not give you a vision but
[1:31:24] he knows how to speak to
[1:31:27] Youk and probably God God God willing
[1:31:30] down the road probably the if it's his
[1:31:32] will we'll be able to speak on the
[1:31:34] makeup of the Bride to bring these
[1:31:37] things so that we able to
[1:31:40] know sometimes we waiting that until I
[1:31:43] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:46] then I'll be understanding on how the
[1:31:49] Lord speaks with me he didn't do so with
[1:31:51] William brunham
[1:31:54] a young child he said defile not your
[1:31:58] body when you shall grow I'll have a
[1:32:01] work to do with
[1:32:03] you he's
[1:32:05] showing how he start to speak to each
[1:32:08] one of us yes some of us see
[1:32:12] Visions some of us see
[1:32:15] dreams some of us our souls and our
[1:32:18] spirit are so
[1:32:19] apart that the only way he access to us
[1:32:22] is only reading the Bible
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:26] some of us we don't even know how to
[1:32:27] read the message but then the next
[1:32:29] fellow who comes it starts speaking and
[1:32:31] then he start opening
[1:32:34] up he wants
[1:32:36] us to see
[1:32:39] him right him keep your eyes on
[1:32:44] him because look at as what is happening
[1:32:48] in the
[1:32:50] world one of the pastors said I said a
[1:32:54] Frank will not die he will be here until
[1:32:57] the
[1:32:58] Rapture oh so you set your eyes on the
[1:33:01] men all this way all these days
[1:33:04] huh you couldn't see
[1:33:08] him now let us learn to keep our eyes on
[1:33:11] him
[1:33:14] amen because when you see him you desire
[1:33:18] now to stay with him abide with
[1:33:21] me stay with us
[1:33:24] yes like the disciples on the road of os
[1:33:29] I said like where do you go come
[1:33:32] in because I want him to change the form
[1:33:37] now from this
[1:33:40] fellow to come
[1:33:42] into and to break the bread for
[1:33:46] you because on the road throughout the
[1:33:49] sermon he takes the time he's explaining
[1:33:51] he's breaking he's going into these
[1:33:53] places but then when you start now
[1:33:55] revealing it specifically to you then
[1:33:59] now it's a whole sermon it's a different
[1:34:02] thing that's right like oh I never seen
[1:34:04] the message this way I thought brother
[1:34:07] brandham was
[1:34:08] wrong he was never
[1:34:11] wrong the thing is I was just too big or
[1:34:15] too small to fit the mantle that's
[1:34:18] right shall we
[1:34:21] pray Heavenly Father
[1:34:24] surely in humility
[1:34:27] and by that Grace and you bringing Lord
[1:34:30] father God our word in places Lord
[1:34:33] father God the way you had designed it
[1:34:35] Lord father to be heard and understood
[1:34:38] by your children know father got some
[1:34:40] types of
[1:34:42] condemnations but Lord strengthening and
[1:34:45] giving L father
[1:34:47] God the necessary uh minerals to help us
[1:34:52] along the journey
[1:34:54] because we are your chosen
[1:34:56] bride and your Prophet says that you're
[1:34:59] doing all you can in order to bring us
[1:35:02] to see these things and you labor
[1:35:06] because you vow to
[1:35:08] Ruth that you shall not
[1:35:11] rest until you've brought it to
[1:35:14] fulfillment to
[1:35:16] Abraham you gave the
[1:35:19] promise and you gave you came down and
[1:35:22] you even L father God gave the
[1:35:25] sacrifice in this day you just didn't
[1:35:28] give the promise you came and you
[1:35:30] married us you brought us a great
[1:35:34] Shalom once again let it be that shalom
[1:35:36] in our hearts tonight as we go by you
[1:35:39] this your grace in Jesus Christ's name
[1:35:43] amen amen God bless you
[1:35:50] [Applause]
[1:35:52] [Music]

[1:36:02] me be it
