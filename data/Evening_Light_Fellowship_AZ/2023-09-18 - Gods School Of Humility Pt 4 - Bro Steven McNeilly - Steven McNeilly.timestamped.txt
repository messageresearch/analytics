[49:02] amen if you have your Bibles turned with
[49:04] me to the Book of Luke
[49:06] Luke chapter 18 and we'll read verses 12
[49:09] through 14.
[49:18] Hallelujah
[49:24] Luke chapter 18.
[49:29] and verse
[49:34] 12. and it's reads like this it says uh
[49:39] will actually start from verse 10 I'm
[49:41] sorry
[49:43] the verse 10 says two men went up into
[49:45] the temple to pray
[49:47] the one a Pharisee and the other a
[49:50] publican
[49:52] the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[49:55] himself God I thank thee that I am not
[49:59] as other men are
[50:02] extortioners unjust adulterers are even
[50:07] as this publican my what an attitude
[50:12] this Pharisee had
[50:17] I fast twice in the week I give tithes
[50:20] of all that I possess
[50:24] he was a pretty good believer
[50:27] he was a very religious righteous man in
[50:31] his own eyes
[50:32] [Applause]
[50:33] [Music]
[50:36] verse 13 says in the public and standing
[50:39] afar off
[50:40] would not lift up so much as his eyes
[50:44] onto heaven
[50:45] but smote upon his breasts saying God be
[50:49] merciful to me a sinner
[50:53] I tell you this man went down to his
[50:56] house Justified rather than the other
[50:59] for every one that exalteth himself
[51:02] shall be abased and he that humbleth
[51:05] himself shall be exalted turn with me to
[51:10] the Book of Mark chapter 9.
[51:17] well read verses 33 and 34.
[51:22] and if you haven't guessed already we're
[51:24] going to continue our thought on Pride
[51:31] Mark chapter 9 and verse 33
[51:34] and says but they understood not no and
[51:38] he came to Capernaum and being in the
[51:41] house he asked them what was it that ye
[51:44] disputed among yourselves by the way
[51:47] but they held their peace I wonder why
[51:50] they held their peace
[51:52] because when they were asked about it
[51:55] they realized how silly it was what they
[51:58] were disputing about that's right
[52:01] he says but they held their peace for by
[52:04] the way they had disputed among
[52:06] themselves who should be the greatest
[52:11] my may the Lord add the blessing to the
[52:13] reading of his word this morning you may
[52:15] be seated
[52:21] I would like to title my sermon this
[52:23] morning God School of humility this is
[52:25] part four and I would like to take for
[52:28] the subject of Pride within the church
[52:33] Pride within the church and in the
[52:37] sermon Pride 1955 brother Branham says o
[52:42] Pride's such a cursed thing
[52:46] so awful
[52:47] so evil
[52:49] is pride
[52:52] so the next time that we see Pride Lift
[52:55] being lifted up in our hearts this quote
[52:57] should come back to our memory that
[53:00] pride is such a cursed thing
[53:03] it is so awful and it is very evil
[53:09] Hallelujah
[53:11] now uh
[53:13] so we realize that
[53:17] um
[53:18] pride is one of these things that
[53:22] all of us deal with in certain ways
[53:27] pride is no respecter of persons
[53:31] pride is not just for the rich and for
[53:35] the famous but pride is for the meek and
[53:38] the lowly believe it or not
[53:40] pride is found in many ways shapes and
[53:44] forms
[53:45] Pride can be found in in in ways and
[53:49] places that we never thought was
[53:52] possible
[53:53] it's very interesting that when we think
[53:55] of Pride we just think of a person who
[53:58] boasts and brags a lot a person with
[54:01] self-confidence a person with uh uh
[54:04] perhaps we think of somebody who thinks
[54:07] they're better than everybody else but
[54:09] as we said the last time as I'm sure you
[54:12] all remember that that is not so that
[54:15] Pride can be found in the Low Places of
[54:19] Our Lives it can be it is so subtle
[54:21] sometimes
[54:23] it is so Sly sometimes and it sneaks its
[54:26] way in very subtly and very quietly
[54:29] without us even realizing it
[54:31] and so my desire is is that when we
[54:35] preach on such subjects as this it's uh
[54:40] it's to shine a light on a subject that
[54:43] whenever the issue would arise in our
[54:46] hearts and in our lives that first off
[54:49] we would recognize it
[54:51] and after we recognize that it's in our
[54:54] lives then we can do something about it
[54:56] because what's the point in just
[54:59] recognizing something but not doing
[55:01] anything about it and so I don't want to
[55:05] be like as uh how would I put it as a
[55:08] barking dog
[55:10] and and bark about pride and bark about
[55:13] this but I want to expose Satan this
[55:16] morning in his dark places so that when
[55:19] it does arise in our lives because guess
[55:22] what this thing called Pride it is it is
[55:25] mixed within the DNA of humanity and so
[55:29] if you're a human being if you are
[55:31] vertical and you're still breathing
[55:33] guess what there's a there's a certain
[55:35] amount of pride in each and every one of
[55:37] our lives but it just shows itself
[55:40] differently in different people
[55:42] according to their characters
[55:48] so some might say well I'm very quiet I
[55:51] don't have pride well I would say that
[55:54] that's your pride that is speaking
[56:00] well I'm I'm I'm an introvert and I'm
[56:03] and I'm not out here like everybody else
[56:05] and I don't think that that sermon
[56:07] applies to me I would say that that is
[56:10] your pride that is speaking within your
[56:12] heart
[56:14] so we find out that
[56:16] as individuals we all have different
[56:19] issues and different things that we deal
[56:21] with for some people it might be music
[56:24] for other people it might be uh it might
[56:28] be video games and it might be movies
[56:30] for some others it might be the pride of
[56:32] life and the lust of the Flesh and some
[56:36] mighty might have a hard time with some
[56:39] of those things and not with others but
[56:41] it's not so with pride
[56:45] all of us well you believe it or not
[56:48] have an issue with pride
[56:52] Hallelujah
[56:56] I feel it is very important to minister
[56:58] on these things because what it does is
[57:01] it exposes Satan within our lives and it
[57:05] helps us to recognize it and and like
[57:08] I've already said when we recognize it
[57:11] it is up to us now to do something about
[57:15] it that when we see him Rising his
[57:19] ugly awful evil head we can say aha
[57:24] I know that spirit I know what's
[57:27] happening here so now by the word of God
[57:29] I'm gonna cut his head off and so how do
[57:33] you how do you kill something how do you
[57:35] cut its head off well you take the sword
[57:37] of the word
[57:38] and you say the word of God says that
[57:41] pride is a very evil thing and I don't
[57:43] want it in my life so therefore I rebuke
[57:46] it
[57:49] it's kind of interesting
[57:52] how do you overcome Pride
[57:57] how is it that we overcome something
[57:59] that that when it's usually too late
[58:02] when we notice that it's Pride if that
[58:04] makes sense
[58:06] you're already prideful it's already
[58:07] happened and then you go oh my goodness
[58:10] there it is again
[58:12] raise his ugly head there's that evil
[58:15] thing in my life again ah
[58:19] so how do we overcome it
[58:22] we overcome it by humility
[58:26] and how do you overcome it by humility
[58:28] because usually pride is when it's
[58:32] against someone else
[58:36] so how do you make it right with someone
[58:39] else as you say I'm sorry
[58:42] whether it's to your wife to your kids
[58:45] to somebody else within the assembly how
[58:49] do you overcome Pride by saying you're
[58:52] sorry
[58:54] Hallelujah
[58:56] easier said than done young man I know
[58:58] it
[59:00] but that's how you overcome it
[59:02] brother Branham says how do you overcome
[59:04] anything you do the opposite of what it
[59:06] is
[59:08] amen
[59:10] so Luke Chapter 5 and we'll read verses
[59:13] 1 through 11. uh it says and I and it
[59:17] came to pass that as the people pressed
[59:19] upon him to hear the word of God he
[59:21] stood by the lake of geneserate and saw
[59:26] two ships standing by the lake but the
[59:28] fishermen were gone out of them and were
[59:30] washing their Nets and he entered into
[59:32] one of the ships which was Simon's and
[59:34] prayed him that he would Thrust out a
[59:36] little from the land and he sat down and
[59:38] taught the people out of the ship now
[59:40] when he had left speaking he said unto
[59:42] Simon launch out into the deep and let
[59:44] your nets down for a drought and Simon
[59:47] answering said unto him Master we have
[59:50] toiled all the night and have taken
[59:52] nothing and I love this he says
[59:54] nevertheless at Thy word I will let down
[59:58] the net and I think that's a very good
[1:00:01] example for us this morning that it
[1:00:04] doesn't matter how many times we've
[1:00:06] prayed how many times we've asked how
[1:00:08] many times we've cried out onto the Lord
[1:00:10] for deliverance of something but yet at
[1:00:13] Thy word Lord it doesn't matter how long
[1:00:15] I've waited it doesn't matter of the
[1:00:17] circumstance but Lord at Thy word I will
[1:00:20] do what you say
[1:00:24] notice what happens and when they had
[1:00:26] done this this when they had this done
[1:00:29] they enclosed a great multitude of
[1:00:32] fishes and their net break
[1:00:35] and they beckoned onto their Partners
[1:00:37] which were in the other ship that they
[1:00:40] should come and help them and they came
[1:00:42] and filled both the ship so that they
[1:00:44] began to sink this was quite a multitude
[1:00:47] of fish
[1:00:49] now notice
[1:00:51] the reaction of Simon Peter here
[1:00:55] when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at
[1:00:59] Jesus knees saying depart from me
[1:01:03] for I am a sinful man oh Lord for he was
[1:01:08] astonished
[1:01:09] and all that were with him at the at the
[1:01:11] drought of the fishes which they had
[1:01:14] taken understand they were fishermen
[1:01:16] they were professionals they knew what
[1:01:19] they were doing they had fished all
[1:01:21] night they hadn't caught anything but
[1:01:23] yet at the word of the Lord
[1:01:25] at the word of the Lord here was this
[1:01:27] great multitude of fish I'm sure he was
[1:01:30] seeing dollar signs flash right before
[1:01:33] his eyes he couldn't believe it
[1:01:35] he was astonished
[1:01:38] how can these things be
[1:01:41] with God The Impossible is always
[1:01:45] possible
[1:01:47] and
[1:01:49] and so was also James and John the sons
[1:01:52] of Zebedee which were partners with
[1:01:54] Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not
[1:01:57] from henceforth Thou shalt catch men
[1:02:00] and when they had brought their ships to
[1:02:02] land they forsook all and they followed
[1:02:05] him
[1:02:07] now the reaction of Peter here is is
[1:02:11] very astounding to me because Peter
[1:02:15] realized that he was in the presence of
[1:02:18] somebody very special
[1:02:20] that's right he knew he he had heard him
[1:02:24] preach he he was he heard his Doctrine
[1:02:27] he heard how he taught the people no
[1:02:30] doubt he saw the people on the land that
[1:02:32] were following him and and no doubt he
[1:02:35] thought this is a very special person
[1:02:37] indeed now brother Branham tells us that
[1:02:40] Peter's
[1:02:42] um father was a very spiritual man and
[1:02:45] he would always teach his boys and say
[1:02:47] there's there's one that's coming like
[1:02:49] an unto Moses and he'll be a prophet and
[1:02:52] and don't worry there'll be there'll be
[1:02:54] many people that'll arise and they'll be
[1:02:56] they'll be the false anointed but that
[1:02:58] doesn't take away from the one true one
[1:03:01] that we're waiting for
[1:03:03] so number one they were taught right
[1:03:06] they were taught what to look for and so
[1:03:09] no doubt when he's seen it come before
[1:03:11] his very eyes he thought my
[1:03:14] the presence that this man has the
[1:03:17] doctrine that he teaches and even at his
[1:03:20] word this great multitude of fish that
[1:03:23] we have caught he is an extremely
[1:03:25] special person
[1:03:28] he was in the presence of God almighty
[1:03:31] now what happens when you're in the
[1:03:33] presence of God guess what it'll bring a
[1:03:36] sinner to his knees it'll bring a person
[1:03:38] who is high and and lifted up within
[1:03:41] themselves into a place of humility and
[1:03:44] safe I am not worthy Lord I am not
[1:03:48] worthy to be in your presence for I am a
[1:03:51] sinful man I am a man of unclean lips I
[1:03:55] dwell amongst people with unclean lips
[1:03:58] and unclean ears
[1:04:01] it doesn't matter if the state that
[1:04:04] you're in when he calls you he's not
[1:04:06] looking at that State but he's looking
[1:04:09] to the Future
[1:04:11] hallelujah how many of you can say I
[1:04:14] remember that time I remember when God
[1:04:18] was dealing with my heart I remember
[1:04:20] when the Holy Spirit was moving in my
[1:04:23] life and I just couldn't take it anymore
[1:04:25] being in that presence I had to
[1:04:27] surrender all
[1:04:30] if you haven't come to that spot yet I
[1:04:33] pray that you do
[1:04:34] because your life will never ever be the
[1:04:37] same again why because you came in to
[1:04:40] his presence it's not a special sermon
[1:04:44] that changes your life
[1:04:46] it's not just something that somebody
[1:04:48] randomly says one time no it's the very
[1:04:51] presence of God that's what changes the
[1:04:54] life of a person
[1:04:58] hallelujah how important it is for us
[1:05:02] to be in the presence of God
[1:05:06] not just a church on a Sunday
[1:05:08] not just at church on a Wednesday night
[1:05:11] but every day it's important for us to
[1:05:14] be in the presence of God to seek his
[1:05:17] face through prayer to listen to the
[1:05:19] sermons to read his word
[1:05:23] what are you doing when you do these
[1:05:25] things you're sensitizing your heart
[1:05:27] you're sensitizing your spirit
[1:05:29] Hallelujah that when he comes by
[1:05:33] you recognize his presence
[1:05:38] oh my you remember that time
[1:05:42] I remember
[1:05:44] you know what it felt like I I'll never
[1:05:46] forget it
[1:05:48] it felt like there was a weight that
[1:05:50] lifted off of my back
[1:05:52] felt like I was carrying this load that
[1:05:55] I didn't even realize I was carrying but
[1:05:58] when I surrendered my heart to God guess
[1:06:00] what this loaded it it came off of my
[1:06:03] back what was it it was the it was the
[1:06:06] load of sin
[1:06:08] it was the shame of sin it was the shame
[1:06:11] of iniquity and I didn't even know I was
[1:06:13] carrying it
[1:06:17] God will take that chip off your
[1:06:19] shoulder if you ever get into his
[1:06:20] presence one time
[1:06:22] God will change that bad attitude if you
[1:06:24] ever get into his presence one time amen
[1:06:28] but as life goes on and we get familiar
[1:06:32] with God
[1:06:34] we get familiar with prayer we get
[1:06:38] familiar with reading his word when you
[1:06:41] first came to the Lord and you had a
[1:06:43] really good experience guess what he
[1:06:45] really nothing would hold you back from
[1:06:47] reading his word at night
[1:06:49] amen nothing would hold you back from a
[1:06:51] sincere prayer to God and and and and
[1:06:53] and praying for Revelation and praying
[1:06:56] for your family and praying for your
[1:06:58] loved ones
[1:06:59] but we get too familiar with God
[1:07:03] we get too familiar with his word we get
[1:07:06] too familiar with prayer and you know
[1:07:08] what familiarity breeds
[1:07:10] content
[1:07:14] and so before long we get to a place
[1:07:17] where ah we're not on fire where we
[1:07:21] should be we're not as sincere as we
[1:07:23] once were our heart is not a flame and
[1:07:26] burning like it once was why because
[1:07:28] we're too familiar with God
[1:07:31] you got to get back to the basics back
[1:07:34] to how it was that sensitivity with God
[1:07:40] we often say well God doesn't speak to
[1:07:44] me like he used to
[1:07:46] I beg to differ
[1:07:48] your spirit and your heart is not as
[1:07:51] sensitive as it used to be
[1:07:53] say brother Stephen how do you know
[1:07:55] because I'm speaking by experience
[1:07:58] I ain't pointing fingers at you I'm
[1:08:00] preaching right at myself we get so
[1:08:03] familiar and so caught up with life that
[1:08:05] guess what we get familiar with God God
[1:08:08] help us
[1:08:10] that as the time draws nearer to his
[1:08:13] coming
[1:08:14] that we'd be like brother Paul love all
[1:08:16] and we're sending emails 10 emails a day
[1:08:19] this word is awesome this is awesome why
[1:08:22] he's feeding upon the word
[1:08:28] Hallelujah
[1:08:33] so as we follow the life of Peter
[1:08:37] Peter's a very interesting character
[1:08:40] as we follow his life you see that Peter
[1:08:43] had many ups and downs in his life
[1:08:47] we see that here he was when he started
[1:08:49] out with God he was he was humbled
[1:08:53] he had a humble he had a humble State he
[1:08:56] didn't care if the other fishing boats
[1:08:58] were around he didn't care who else was
[1:09:00] around but he was at a place where he's
[1:09:02] where he recognized the sin in his life
[1:09:04] and and he got onto his knees and he
[1:09:06] said oh God I'm a sinful man I shouldn't
[1:09:08] be in your presence
[1:09:12] but it's very interesting as time goes
[1:09:14] on
[1:09:15] and he follows the Lord and He forsakes
[1:09:17] all and he leaves everything and and
[1:09:19] he's a really good believer he gets so
[1:09:22] familiar with the Lord
[1:09:24] that one time he was the Lord was
[1:09:27] thronged by people people were touching
[1:09:29] him all over the place and the Lord said
[1:09:31] who touched me
[1:09:33] he perceived that virtue and went out of
[1:09:36] his body
[1:09:37] and now here is Peter
[1:09:39] a man who was once humble
[1:09:41] a man who was once very sincere with God
[1:09:44] and recognized that he was a sinful man
[1:09:47] he says Lord
[1:09:48] what are you talking about
[1:09:51] can't be saying that around everybody
[1:09:53] everybody's touching you
[1:09:55] don't say that
[1:09:58] they're going to think you're crazy
[1:10:00] they're going to think that I'm crazy
[1:10:01] for following you
[1:10:04] brother Branham says he rebuked the Lord
[1:10:08] can you imagine
[1:10:10] his pride got so lifted up within
[1:10:13] himself that he rebuked the Lord
[1:10:17] and he said be quiet you can't say stuff
[1:10:21] like that around the people everybody's
[1:10:22] touching you
[1:10:24] but Peter had failed to recognize that
[1:10:27] something Supernatural was going on
[1:10:30] so it is with us because of our pride
[1:10:33] and carnality
[1:10:34] we we forget and we miss the very moving
[1:10:37] of God amongst us because we're looking
[1:10:39] at the wrong thing amen
[1:10:44] hahaha so he starts off in humility
[1:10:47] and now he gets high and lifted up
[1:10:50] so we get to another point in his life
[1:10:52] where the Lord is talking about uh the
[1:10:55] son of man must must be crucified and on
[1:10:57] the third day Rise Again from the dead
[1:10:59] and all these different things and Peter
[1:11:01] says
[1:11:02] not so Lord
[1:11:04] that's not going to happen
[1:11:06] so now Jesus turns to Peter
[1:11:09] and he says I rebuke thee Satan
[1:11:15] can you imagine being Peter at that time
[1:11:22] he just called me a
[1:11:28] could you imagine I'm sure that Peter
[1:11:30] doubted his experience when he first met
[1:11:32] the Lord
[1:11:35] here he is and then we find another
[1:11:38] place about Peter and he's taken up to
[1:11:41] the Mount of transfiguration
[1:11:44] and no doubt it was a an amazing
[1:11:47] experience it was a Bethel experience he
[1:11:50] saw Moses and Elijah and he saw the Lord
[1:11:53] and his arraignment had changed and he
[1:11:55] was transfigured and he heard a voice
[1:11:56] hear ye him
[1:12:00] but yet then he's called the devil
[1:12:05] so then Peter there's a storm
[1:12:08] and here comes the Lord walking on the
[1:12:10] waters
[1:12:13] notice Peter's life the ups and downs he
[1:12:15] said Lord of that be you let me come
[1:12:18] as Faith was strong
[1:12:21] the Bible says that Peter walked on
[1:12:22] water
[1:12:23] everybody likes to say oh doubtful Peter
[1:12:27] I would like to see some of us walking
[1:12:28] on water
[1:12:31] realize that Peter had a certain amount
[1:12:33] of faith in order to do this
[1:12:37] but yet here he is walking on water a
[1:12:40] supernatural experience has taken place
[1:12:42] but then he begins to sink because he's
[1:12:45] looking at his surroundings around him
[1:12:47] so he goes from up here to down here he
[1:12:51] goes from the level of Faith the level
[1:12:53] of my goodness Supernatural things are
[1:12:55] happening and then he's rebuked for his
[1:12:57] unbelief
[1:12:59] can you see the ups and downs of Peter's
[1:13:01] life he has Supernatural experiences and
[1:13:05] then he's humbled he has a supernatural
[1:13:08] experience and then he's humbled he has
[1:13:10] a supernatural experience and then he's
[1:13:13] humbled
[1:13:14] has it ever happened to any of you
[1:13:16] where it seems like God is moving in
[1:13:18] your life you have a supernatural
[1:13:21] experience he he he gives you a word and
[1:13:23] due season he gives you something and
[1:13:25] you feel real good you feel like you're
[1:13:28] in Cloud Nine and you feel like God
[1:13:29] really moved and did something for you
[1:13:31] in the service
[1:13:34] but then the next day
[1:13:36] it seems like you're back to your old
[1:13:37] self again
[1:13:39] and then a little while down the line
[1:13:41] and it happens again and it happens
[1:13:44] again and it happens again and you begin
[1:13:46] to think my goodness what's wrong with
[1:13:48] me
[1:13:49] there's nothing wrong with you God is
[1:13:52] just keeping you humble
[1:13:55] [Laughter]
[1:13:56] because if we were always on cloud nine
[1:13:59] with all these Supernatural experiences
[1:14:01] and nothing can bother us guess what
[1:14:04] will be a spoiled brat
[1:14:06] so what God has to do is he has to take
[1:14:08] us through this life's journey of ups
[1:14:11] and downs of ups and downs of ups and
[1:14:15] downs it has nothing to do with the seed
[1:14:19] he's just keeping your carnal man under
[1:14:23] check
[1:14:23] because God dwells in humility
[1:14:35] Peter he goes
[1:14:37] he goes Lord I'll never deny you ever
[1:14:42] he says oh Peter before the crows
[1:14:45] you'll demand you'll deny me twice
[1:14:49] it's very interesting we always think
[1:14:51] about Peter denying the Lord
[1:14:53] I want to ask you where were the other
[1:14:54] disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:14:58] where was everybody where was the
[1:15:00] Beloved John
[1:15:02] who would do no wrong
[1:15:04] and Jesus loved them so much and he
[1:15:07] loved Jesus where was he when they were
[1:15:09] taking him to be crucified he ran with
[1:15:11] everybody else
[1:15:15] so it wasn't only Peter that was humbled
[1:15:17] but it was the rest of the disciples
[1:15:20] can you imagine here there was the man
[1:15:23] that they loved they thought he was the
[1:15:25] Messiah but yet at the first time that
[1:15:28] there was any kind of
[1:15:30] um
[1:15:31] what's the word conflict thank you any
[1:15:35] kind of conflict hey they ran like
[1:15:37] scared rats
[1:15:39] when there's conflict there's something
[1:15:41] happening in the church it's not a time
[1:15:43] to run
[1:15:44] it's a time to put your feet in the
[1:15:47] ground it's a time to get your knees on
[1:15:49] the ground and pray for the situations
[1:15:51] not to run off and go everywhere else
[1:15:54] stay your ground fight the good fight of
[1:15:57] faith
[1:16:01] in the Book of Luke it almost broke my
[1:16:03] heart when I read this
[1:16:05] here was Peter
[1:16:07] and he was standing afar off
[1:16:10] and here there was he that already asked
[1:16:13] him if oh well surely you're one of
[1:16:16] those and and you're one of his
[1:16:17] followers and he says no I'm not
[1:16:22] and the Bible says in the Book of Luke
[1:16:25] that g the crew
[1:16:28] and Jesus turned and looked at Peter
[1:16:35] and then he knew when he remembered the
[1:16:38] saying of the Lord
[1:16:40] and the Bible says he wept
[1:16:42] bitterly
[1:16:45] I feel like weeping with them
[1:16:49] how many times throughout the week
[1:16:53] are we denying the Lord by denying him
[1:16:56] our time
[1:16:57] how many times throughout the week are
[1:16:59] we denying the Lord by not saying what
[1:17:02] we should be saying to to somebody
[1:17:04] that's in need to helping somebody
[1:17:06] that's in need around us
[1:17:10] I wonder if we can see the face of the
[1:17:13] Lord
[1:17:14] and if we could hear
[1:17:16] the the crowing of the rooster behind us
[1:17:20] every time that we deny the Lord while
[1:17:22] we're here on this Earth
[1:17:25] how would it make us feel
[1:17:29] oh God
[1:17:32] we're a sinful people
[1:17:38] ah
[1:17:40] but the Blood
[1:17:43] Hallelujah covers it all
[1:17:49] elujah
[1:17:56] Luke chapter 18 verses 11 and 12.
[1:18:03] it says the Pharisees stood and prayed
[1:18:05] thus within himself as our opening
[1:18:07] scripture
[1:18:09] God I thank thee that I'm not as other
[1:18:12] men are
[1:18:14] extortioners and unjust and adulterers
[1:18:17] or even as his publican
[1:18:21] I fast twice in the week and I give
[1:18:23] tithes of all that I possess
[1:18:27] here is a man
[1:18:29] he didn't try to hide his pride at all
[1:18:32] notice I'm talking about Pride within
[1:18:36] the church
[1:18:38] I'm going somewhere like this
[1:18:42] not just with in our lives
[1:18:46] but within a church body
[1:18:50] not just evening Light Fellowship
[1:18:53] but the body of Jesus Christ around the
[1:18:55] world
[1:18:56] not to jump ahead of myself but I
[1:18:59] believe that pride is running rampant a
[1:19:02] long message ranks right now
[1:19:09] so here was this man and
[1:19:11] he was an extremely religious man he was
[1:19:15] a Pharisee
[1:19:17] you couldn't put
[1:19:18] a pin on his life you couldn't say well
[1:19:21] I saw this man doing this and and I saw
[1:19:24] this man doing that and he's a sinner no
[1:19:26] he was a Pharisee
[1:19:28] extremely religious he fasted twice in
[1:19:31] the week
[1:19:32] not only did he pay tithes on the money
[1:19:35] that he earned but upon all of his
[1:19:37] possessions
[1:19:38] I wonder how many of us are like that
[1:19:40] this morning
[1:19:43] or do we just give the bare minimum
[1:19:46] do we just give it down to the to the
[1:19:48] sin
[1:19:52] are are we outgiven God
[1:19:55] understand we can never outgive the Lord
[1:20:01] he was a good church member
[1:20:05] no doubt he helped out amongst in the
[1:20:07] Assembly of the rest of the Pharisees no
[1:20:11] doubt he was a man of good works
[1:20:14] a very spiritual man but yet there was
[1:20:17] something in his life that was missing
[1:20:19] there was something within his life and
[1:20:22] within his heart that just wasn't quite
[1:20:24] right there was something off with him
[1:20:28] and understand even if other people
[1:20:30] cannot see it God sees it
[1:20:34] and God understands
[1:20:39] whenever this Pharisee got lifted up in
[1:20:42] his heart you know what it did to all of
[1:20:44] his tithing to all of his good works to
[1:20:47] all of his fasting and to all of these
[1:20:49] other things and absolutely annulled all
[1:20:53] of it it was worthless it was pointless
[1:20:56] it was all in vain why because he had a
[1:21:00] prideful heart
[1:21:02] because of the way that he was looking
[1:21:04] at at another person because of the way
[1:21:08] that he was looking at this public and
[1:21:10] he said this guy is a Publican he's a
[1:21:12] sinner he's he's a tax collector for the
[1:21:15] Romans against his own people how in the
[1:21:18] world could he do that
[1:21:20] he's a sinner I'm glad I'm not like this
[1:21:23] guy
[1:21:25] but yet here was a sinner
[1:21:28] doesn't say he paid ties
[1:21:30] doesn't say he went to church
[1:21:33] it doesn't say that he did any good
[1:21:35] works or anything like that but because
[1:21:38] his heart was in the right place
[1:21:41] because he realized the sin that he was
[1:21:44] living in he said oh God forgive me a
[1:21:47] sinner
[1:21:48] that is the kind of heart that God wants
[1:21:51] and that is the kind of person that God
[1:21:54] can use within the assembly
[1:22:00] all is good works
[1:22:03] everything that he did that was good
[1:22:04] every uh all of it hey guess what it was
[1:22:08] annulled
[1:22:10] because this guy went away Justified
[1:22:13] rather than this guy
[1:22:18] so what happened no doubt he started out
[1:22:20] well
[1:22:22] and no doubt he started out with a good
[1:22:25] heart with the right intentions to Serve
[1:22:28] the People
[1:22:29] with the right intentions to help those
[1:22:31] in need with the right intentions to
[1:22:33] help support the church with his
[1:22:34] tithings and his offerings and all these
[1:22:36] different things but throughout the
[1:22:38] course of time something changed in his
[1:22:41] heart
[1:22:43] just like Peter when he started out he
[1:22:45] was a humble man
[1:22:47] but yet something changed in his heart
[1:22:50] that Pride had gotten lifted up and he
[1:22:53] rebuked the very Lord that he was
[1:22:54] serving
[1:22:57] I wonder how many of us
[1:23:00] we start out good
[1:23:03] we start out humble
[1:23:06] we start out soft
[1:23:08] our nature is soft
[1:23:10] our heart is soft our spirit is soft God
[1:23:15] has picked us out of the Mary clay and
[1:23:17] he's he set us Upon This Rock and and
[1:23:19] and and we can feel the loving arms of
[1:23:22] God but throughout time we get so
[1:23:24] familiar
[1:23:26] and we think we're doing so good
[1:23:30] well I do this within the assembly
[1:23:33] and I do that and I serve this and I pay
[1:23:36] that and I I I I I
[1:23:40] I'm before long pride gets lifted within
[1:23:43] our hearts
[1:23:45] that when we see somebody else within
[1:23:48] the assembly
[1:23:50] within the body of Christ around the
[1:23:52] world that perhaps is not doing right
[1:23:54] we're so quick to cast the stones
[1:23:59] we're so quick to point fingers
[1:24:03] we're so quick to say well I'm glad my
[1:24:04] family ain't like that
[1:24:07] my kids are doing good
[1:24:10] how's yours
[1:24:12] huh oh yeah
[1:24:14] you know why I'm really asking because I
[1:24:16] know they're struggling
[1:24:17] yeah tell me
[1:24:19] tell me about it
[1:24:21] what happens started out right
[1:24:25] continued to be right but somewhere
[1:24:27] along the line something changed
[1:24:30] something happened
[1:24:32] and the humility that God wants dwelt in
[1:24:35] turned into Pride which is an ugly
[1:24:39] awful
[1:24:41] thing evil thing
[1:24:44] in the sight of God Amen
[1:24:53] I wonder how many of us
[1:24:57] has got pride in our hearts towards
[1:24:59] families of of
[1:25:01] that are less fortunate within the
[1:25:03] assembly
[1:25:06] kids that are having a hard time ah we
[1:25:08] could go on and on
[1:25:11] I wonder when the last time was that we
[1:25:13] actually prayed for the family
[1:25:17] and for the person
[1:25:19] and for the situation listen this is
[1:25:21] Christianity 101.
[1:25:25] but we get so caught up with the algebra
[1:25:28] of the message that we leave off the
[1:25:31] beginnings we leave off the basics we
[1:25:34] leave off the foundation of which our
[1:25:36] faith is built upon
[1:25:41] and we get so caught up with with the
[1:25:43] mysteries of God and the Seven Seals and
[1:25:46] and it's wonderful and and I enjoy
[1:25:49] studying it and everything like that but
[1:25:51] what good is it if we're leaving this
[1:25:53] off back here
[1:26:01] Mighty Within
[1:26:04] that he forgot
[1:26:06] what Christianity is all about
[1:26:16] the God of this evil age
[1:26:18] 1965 brother Branham said he said if you
[1:26:21] would have believed Moses he's talking
[1:26:24] about religious people here
[1:26:26] you would have believed me
[1:26:28] for Moses spoke of me and still they
[1:26:31] didn't see it the very God Of Heaven
[1:26:34] dying on the cross and saying the same
[1:26:35] words the prophet said he would say and
[1:26:38] still they didn't see it see
[1:26:40] they were not of his kind
[1:26:44] they was not the word
[1:26:46] not the word and yet they were very
[1:26:50] religious
[1:26:51] but they was not the word it would have
[1:26:54] recognized its place for that hour
[1:26:59] when I read that it it struck me deeply
[1:27:03] that being religious and having a form
[1:27:08] of religion guess what it's not good
[1:27:10] enough
[1:27:11] that's not good enough to just go to
[1:27:13] church and pay your tithes and and serve
[1:27:15] the people and go through all these
[1:27:17] rituals but
[1:27:19] it's the word will bring forth after its
[1:27:23] kind after his kind so if it was all
[1:27:27] about just being religious there'd be
[1:27:30] Many religious people that would be okay
[1:27:32] that have never been born again
[1:27:35] so I got to thinking about this and I
[1:27:37] thought my
[1:27:39] what is the message really about
[1:27:44] where is it taking us to is this message
[1:27:47] from a man
[1:27:49] was it given by a man and is its
[1:27:53] Revelation given by a man the answer to
[1:27:56] those questions are all no
[1:27:58] that's right it is not given by a man it
[1:28:01] was given by God Almighty it is not
[1:28:04] inspired by man it was inspired by God
[1:28:07] and it is not revealed by man but it is
[1:28:10] revealed by God
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:13] so therefore whenever the word is
[1:28:17] preached the word within us will say
[1:28:20] Amen to the word that is preached and
[1:28:23] everybody says amen
[1:28:26] so now when brother Branham who's
[1:28:28] preaching this word that is given by God
[1:28:31] and is inspired by God if we are of that
[1:28:35] same word if we are bone of his bone and
[1:28:38] flesh of his flesh we are going to
[1:28:40] respond by an Amen brother Branham says
[1:28:44] you'll punctuate it by an amen
[1:28:47] so when he comes and he preaches and he
[1:28:50] says you men
[1:28:51] he says you need to stop the dirty jokes
[1:28:54] whenever he tells us to stop the dirty
[1:28:57] jokes the word preached the word in our
[1:29:00] heart responds to the word and says amen
[1:29:05] when he tells us that combing our hair a
[1:29:08] certain way and wearing Suede Shoes is
[1:29:11] uh is is is
[1:29:13] um perverted the word within our hearts
[1:29:16] responds to the word and says amen
[1:29:20] why because we believe that this message
[1:29:23] is inspired and it's given of God
[1:29:27] so when the word preached and he talks
[1:29:30] about the women not cutting her hair and
[1:29:33] that wearing clothes immoral clothes and
[1:29:35] then different things the word that's
[1:29:37] within the hearts of our sisters will
[1:29:40] respond and say Amen why because we know
[1:29:45] where the word is coming from it is not
[1:29:48] the word of a man it's not just a man
[1:29:51] that's trying to tell us what to do and
[1:29:53] trying to beat us down no it's almighty
[1:29:56] God that's trying to tell us how to live
[1:29:58] our lives
[1:30:01] and so we we take these things we we get
[1:30:04] so familiar with it
[1:30:06] because we hear it on every tape and we
[1:30:08] hear this but this message should not be
[1:30:11] familiar to us as Believers because it's
[1:30:14] fresh manna
[1:30:16] and so when we say Amen we're not just
[1:30:19] going to punctuate it with an amen from
[1:30:21] our mouth but we're going to punctuate
[1:30:23] it with an amen through our lives
[1:30:26] so when he tells us to do something
[1:30:28] guess what we're going to take the word
[1:30:30] we're going to respond with the name man
[1:30:32] and we're going to apply it to our lives
[1:30:36] so important
[1:30:38] because what good is it just recognizing
[1:30:40] something and not doing anything about
[1:30:42] it
[1:30:44] he could preach in the seals and we'll
[1:30:46] say amen he could preach on the church
[1:30:48] ages the godhead uh water baptism all
[1:30:51] these great Mysteries that have been
[1:30:53] unfolded and we'll say Amen why because
[1:30:55] we are of the word and we're responding
[1:30:57] to the word
[1:31:00] but
[1:31:02] what happens
[1:31:04] whenever something gets in the way
[1:31:06] let me ask you what happens if something
[1:31:09] gets in the way of us of the Sun
[1:31:11] what does it create
[1:31:14] a shadow
[1:31:20] so whenever something in our lives
[1:31:23] gets in the way of the word which is the
[1:31:25] son the s-u-n out here natural the son
[1:31:28] spiritual whenever something gets in the
[1:31:31] way of the sun and the natural it
[1:31:33] creates a shadow
[1:31:35] so whenever something in our lives
[1:31:38] an object whatever it might be whenever
[1:31:41] it gets into the way of the s o n the
[1:31:44] word of God guess what it creates it
[1:31:47] creates a shadow on our lives
[1:31:53] and when something is shadowed when a
[1:31:56] seed or a flower is shadowed over with
[1:31:59] and it never gets direct sunlight it
[1:32:02] will never bring forth to its full
[1:32:04] potential
[1:32:06] because a seed or a flower whatever it
[1:32:09] is it needs direct sunlight it needs
[1:32:12] water it needs the right ground that
[1:32:13] it's planted in what do we need we need
[1:32:16] the Son of God we need the Holy Spirit
[1:32:19] to water it
[1:32:21] to take that seed and so that it'll
[1:32:23] bring forth of its kind
[1:32:26] but when something's shadowing it
[1:32:29] will never bring forth
[1:32:31] of its full potential of what it is it's
[1:32:34] still a seed
[1:32:37] still a sun
[1:32:39] still a daughter
[1:32:41] but many people's lives they get
[1:32:43] shadowed over by something what is it a
[1:32:45] lot of times it's Pride
[1:32:50] this object of pride
[1:32:54] raises in our hearts
[1:32:57] and it's an object that gets between the
[1:33:01] word of God and the seed that's dwelling
[1:33:03] within our hearts
[1:33:05] and what happens is now we begin to look
[1:33:08] at the word differently
[1:33:12] so when brother Branham comes along and
[1:33:15] these guys for an example because I'm a
[1:33:18] guy it's easier
[1:33:19] when he says uh don't be wearing those
[1:33:22] suede shoes and he says and purple
[1:33:25] so obviously color had something to do
[1:33:27] with it I don't know
[1:33:29] people have their own thoughts in that
[1:33:30] and that's okay go look up the quote
[1:33:35] if there's something in our hearts
[1:33:37] an object of Pride or whatever it might
[1:33:40] be and that word is preached we respond
[1:33:44] with
[1:33:45] that was in brother branham's day
[1:33:52] things have changed today
[1:33:57] guys can get away with wearing an acting
[1:33:59] and acting kind of
[1:34:01] however way they want and they can get
[1:34:04] away with it
[1:34:05] they can comb their hair whatever way
[1:34:07] they want whatever it is
[1:34:10] our carnal reasoning now begins to
[1:34:13] respond
[1:34:15] and instead of responding with the name
[1:34:17] man
[1:34:18] that's the truth we respond and say
[1:34:21] that's that preacher's interpretation
[1:34:25] we respond and say well that was for
[1:34:28] that day back then that's not for today
[1:34:34] whenever he preaches things
[1:34:36] about a moral dress and skirts and not
[1:34:40] cutting her hair for her sisters and the
[1:34:42] women being the uh the the the
[1:34:45] Homemakers and all these different
[1:34:47] things whenever there's an object in the
[1:34:50] way of the word will respond and say
[1:34:53] well that's not for today
[1:34:57] that was 50 years ago times have changed
[1:35:00] how women are treated as changed the
[1:35:02] everything's different than it was back
[1:35:04] then why are we responding like that
[1:35:08] because there's an object in the way of
[1:35:11] the word
[1:35:12] and we're not responding to the word
[1:35:15] like we know we should be
[1:35:21] we could go on the list is endless but
[1:35:23] you get where I'm going with this
[1:35:26] so now what are we supposed to do about
[1:35:29] it
[1:35:30] recognize it
[1:35:31] because the word listen
[1:35:34] it's nothing to do with the seed
[1:35:38] your sons and daughters
[1:35:39] but there's something overshadowing it
[1:35:42] get rid of the object
[1:35:45] get rid of the pride get rid of whatever
[1:35:48] it is that's preventing you to be in the
[1:35:50] direct sunlight of the word of God Amen
[1:35:53] and punctuated with an amen not just
[1:35:56] with your lips
[1:35:58] but with a life
[1:36:01] and then say Lord I know your word is
[1:36:04] true
[1:36:05] every son and daughter of God that's our
[1:36:08] desire is to fulfill the word of God in
[1:36:11] our lives so we say Lord I know your
[1:36:13] word is true I know my reaction and
[1:36:16] saying amen isn't what it's supposed to
[1:36:17] be please help me Lord
[1:36:20] watch God come on the scene amen
[1:36:25] amen
[1:36:33] Hallelujah there's so many things that
[1:36:35] we can say
[1:36:36] Amen to
[1:36:38] to the word of God
[1:36:42] now
[1:36:43] we find out that
[1:36:46] like I already said
[1:36:49] I believe that
[1:36:51] the spirit of pride is
[1:36:53] is running Rampage
[1:36:56] amongst message believers
[1:36:58] and message churches
[1:37:00] all over the world
[1:37:04] I seen a video of a minister it was last
[1:37:07] year
[1:37:08] and he was he took a three-hour it was
[1:37:12] three hours long
[1:37:14] and he blasted another Minister for
[1:37:16] three hours
[1:37:20] and he said something along these words
[1:37:22] he said
[1:37:24] it would take a hundred of this minister
[1:37:27] to make one of me
[1:37:33] and they're very
[1:37:35] known ministers around the world
[1:37:39] and I thought my goodness
[1:37:41] is that what this message is producing
[1:37:45] when I look at brother branham's life
[1:37:48] and I look at how he conducted himself
[1:37:51] all I see is humility
[1:37:55] and so when I see this Pride raising up
[1:37:58] amongst ministers and amongst the
[1:38:00] congregations I think there's something
[1:38:02] wrong somewhere because it's not how it
[1:38:06] began
[1:38:07] and if it's not how it began it
[1:38:09] shouldn't be how it is now and it
[1:38:11] shouldn't be How It Ends
[1:38:17] and so we find out that this
[1:38:20] this pride is amongst churches
[1:38:23] it's amongst congregations
[1:38:26] when we think we do we just think about
[1:38:28] preachers
[1:38:29] who's beyond the preachers
[1:38:33] watch with me for a second
[1:38:37] the thing now that everybody's debating
[1:38:39] about
[1:38:40] is who has the greatest balance within
[1:38:42] the message
[1:38:45] well
[1:38:47] this church over here is too quiet
[1:38:50] there are a bunch of bicycles this
[1:38:52] church over here is too loud
[1:38:54] they're a bunch of fanatics but our
[1:38:56] church
[1:38:57] us we have the greatest balance amongst
[1:39:00] the message
[1:39:03] I don't believe that we realize that
[1:39:05] what's actually happening is because
[1:39:07] understand this concept that Pride when
[1:39:11] I thought about Pride there was one word
[1:39:13] that came into my mind and that was
[1:39:15] contentions
[1:39:19] so where is the contentions coming from
[1:39:22] amongst message Believers and amongst
[1:39:25] our rents as coming from Pride
[1:39:29] well our church has the greatest balance
[1:39:31] we know just when to clap we know when
[1:39:33] to be quiet we're not doing this and
[1:39:35] we're not uh we're not starchy and stiff
[1:39:39] and we're not this but but you guys over
[1:39:41] there and then these guys over here are
[1:39:43] looking over there and they're saying
[1:39:44] well these guys are too much of this and
[1:39:46] we have the best desks and we have a
[1:39:48] better song leader and they sing their
[1:39:50] songs differently it's not right
[1:39:53] what is happening with this Pride that
[1:39:57] is coming up amongst message churches
[1:39:59] right now it's causing contentions
[1:40:06] and let me just be very honest
[1:40:08] gotta stop
[1:40:12] aren't we don't we believe the same word
[1:40:16] some we have the same father
[1:40:19] weren't we born the same way we're
[1:40:22] aren't we sealed with the same Holy
[1:40:24] Ghost so why is this raising up amongst
[1:40:26] us it's because we're not being able to
[1:40:28] identify what pride is
[1:40:38] our pastor's the greatest
[1:40:40] no our pastors the greatest no no no no
[1:40:43] no no our pastor is the best
[1:40:47] look at the disciples
[1:40:51] aren't they arguing amongst themselves
[1:40:53] who would be the greatest
[1:40:55] who's the greatest amongst us who's the
[1:40:57] most important who's the best preacher
[1:40:59] who's the best congregation who's got
[1:41:01] the best music who's got the best this
[1:41:03] and when Jesus asked him about it Mike
[1:41:05] they got all embarrassed
[1:41:07] nothing
[1:41:10] it's just childish yeah
[1:41:12] it is just childish
[1:41:15] it's Child's Play
[1:41:17] and it doesn't belong amongst believers
[1:41:25] how are we supposed to respond to it
[1:41:27] brother Stephen just keep our mouths
[1:41:29] shut
[1:41:33] your wife about it
[1:41:35] she'll listen and not tell anybody
[1:41:38] talk to your husband about it
[1:41:40] but the fact that we get out now
[1:41:43] and and everything is so connected
[1:41:46] through the internet
[1:41:50] people are taking video screenshots of
[1:41:52] their phone
[1:41:54] and they're sending it around
[1:41:56] it's Minister preached this oh
[1:41:59] do you think he's preaching it at this
[1:42:01] person
[1:42:02] are that they're preaching this at that
[1:42:05] person and people are so caught up with
[1:42:07] with the contentions that's amongst us
[1:42:10] right now that we're forgetting the goal
[1:42:13] that we're here for and that's to make a
[1:42:16] rapture
[1:42:17] that's to get into the word
[1:42:20] and personal relationship with God
[1:42:28] Child's Play
[1:42:31] oh Lord ah nothing
[1:42:33] it's it's silly we don't really want to
[1:42:36] answer it yeah it is silly
[1:42:41] it needs to end
[1:42:46] because as long as there's Pride
[1:42:49] there will always be contentions
[1:42:52] and as long as there's contentions there
[1:42:55] will never be a Unity
[1:42:57] as long as there's contentions that's
[1:42:59] what you're going to keep your eyes
[1:43:00] focused on rather than the word of God
[1:43:04] and serving God and serving God's people
[1:43:12] Hallelujah
[1:43:15] this Pharisee no doubt he started off
[1:43:17] serving the people very well
[1:43:20] but when a man loses his love for the
[1:43:24] people and I'm talking about all of us
[1:43:27] collectively when we lose our love for
[1:43:31] one another
[1:43:33] we have no effect in each other's lives
[1:43:37] brother Branham said I lost the feelings
[1:43:39] for the people
[1:43:42] his ministry wasn't as effective when he
[1:43:45] didn't have an effect and a love for the
[1:43:48] people we are no different
[1:43:52] and what causes it is
[1:44:00] the moment that somebody loses their
[1:44:02] love for the people Pride will take its
[1:44:04] place and they'll not they'll serve
[1:44:07] because of an outward appearance
[1:44:11] oh that's good they'll serve because
[1:44:14] they they think it looks good everybody
[1:44:16] else looking at them but yet within
[1:44:19] their heart they're saying look at that
[1:44:20] person that I had to help
[1:44:22] publican
[1:44:26] um
[1:44:28] that's what's happening
[1:44:30] used to be president would say my my
[1:44:33] church uh
[1:44:34] um when we would leave everybody would
[1:44:37] be hugging and crying and there was such
[1:44:40] a Unity amongst the people such as
[1:44:42] humility they couldn't wait to see them
[1:44:44] at the next service again where is this
[1:44:47] humility went to
[1:44:49] where is it gone
[1:44:51] pride has taken its place
[1:44:58] so when I thought about
[1:45:01] what is pride
[1:45:03] done to us
[1:45:05] as a church body collectively
[1:45:09] around the world
[1:45:11] contentions was the word that came to my
[1:45:13] mind
[1:45:14] and I was trying to think of other
[1:45:16] things and it seemed like I was just at
[1:45:19] a roadblock thinking of it and I thought
[1:45:21] my
[1:45:22] perhaps this is the the main thing that
[1:45:25] the Lord wants me to touch on this
[1:45:27] morning
[1:45:28] is contentions why is there contentions
[1:45:32] amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:45:34] because bride cannot persecute Pride
[1:45:38] so where is the contentions coming from
[1:45:42] is coming from Pride raising his
[1:45:45] ugly evil head in our lives in our
[1:45:48] churches and around the world and we're
[1:45:51] not aware of it
[1:45:58] Hallelujah
[1:46:02] the exact same thing is happening today
[1:46:06] as what was happening with the disciples
[1:46:10] an argument at disputing a contention of
[1:46:14] who's the greatest
[1:46:15] what does it matter
[1:46:19] you know what
[1:46:21] a brother said to me one time and I
[1:46:23] thought that this was
[1:46:25] excellent he said brother Stephen
[1:46:27] there's going to be no churches in
[1:46:29] heaven
[1:46:32] no churches
[1:46:34] elf's not going to be over here this
[1:46:36] one's not going to be over here this
[1:46:38] one's not gonna we're not going to have
[1:46:40] our own streets of churches in heaven
[1:46:45] so what does it matter
[1:46:48] I guess it's good for us to have pride
[1:46:50] of ownership of church and all these
[1:46:52] different things and and that's a good
[1:46:54] thing but when it gets to a place of
[1:46:56] when we're at a point where we're
[1:46:58] pointing fingers at everybody else's
[1:47:00] congregation other people's youth group
[1:47:04] this church is well our youth group is
[1:47:06] the best and we're better than all the
[1:47:09] rest
[1:47:11] that pride is going to bring a fall
[1:47:13] faster than we know it
[1:47:18] that's one of the things that the Lord
[1:47:19] really
[1:47:20] keeps on top of me with
[1:47:23] I can't brag on nothing without it
[1:47:25] breaking
[1:47:28] it's a fact
[1:47:30] I get to if I get the bragging about my
[1:47:32] work truck I like that thing and you
[1:47:34] know next thing that's going to happen
[1:47:35] check engine light's going to come on
[1:47:40] I'm not going to say nothing the other
[1:47:43] couple months ago me and Miles spent a
[1:47:45] day together and had to go to Chandler
[1:47:48] or whatever and it was at that time
[1:47:49] everybody was getting flat tires it
[1:47:51] seemed like every three miles there's a
[1:47:53] flat tire
[1:47:54] and Miles he told me he said Dad I'm so
[1:47:57] glad we never get flat tires I was like
[1:47:59] oh son
[1:48:04] don't say that he said why it's true I
[1:48:07] said it's going to happen just watch
[1:48:10] three days later I'm with Mariah
[1:48:13] kids were real good so I was going to
[1:48:15] Chick-fil-A to get them some ice cream
[1:48:17] and we all know Chick-fil-A has some of
[1:48:18] the best ice cream
[1:48:20] so on our way to Chick-fil-A guess what
[1:48:23] happens
[1:48:24] get a flat tire
[1:48:26] like 500 yards from the house
[1:48:31] what is God doing he's not punishing us
[1:48:34] he's just keeping us humble
[1:48:37] I was glad that brother James lives
[1:48:39] close by to come and help me
[1:48:42] number one rule make sure you got a good
[1:48:45] jack in your car
[1:48:48] huh
[1:48:49] some of us are knuckleheads that's me
[1:48:52] yeah make sure it works before you go
[1:48:55] out because then you know that you know
[1:48:57] amen
[1:49:01] uh the Lord knows what we need
[1:49:09] So within
[1:49:10] the church body now we see that
[1:49:13] when pride gets amongst us as Believers
[1:49:16] we look at each other differently
[1:49:20] chances are we look down our nose at
[1:49:22] someone else someone else's Misfortune
[1:49:24] whatever it might be I I don't know
[1:49:27] you can fill out the blank
[1:49:31] but when Pride arise in our hearts
[1:49:34] we don't serve like we should
[1:49:37] saints of God
[1:49:39] something needs to change
[1:49:43] something needs to happen
[1:49:45] amongst us
[1:49:47] that takes us back to that genuine love
[1:49:51] that was once once had amongst the
[1:49:53] Believers the genuine care the genuine
[1:49:56] sincerity the the genuine servitude
[1:50:00] where we go out of our way to call
[1:50:02] somebody who we haven't seen in a while
[1:50:03] or whatever the issue may be
[1:50:07] I believe that we need to get back to
[1:50:11] basics
[1:50:15] now brother Branham tells this story and
[1:50:18] I'll share this with you and this will
[1:50:20] be my closing story
[1:50:23] brother Branham tells a story of one of
[1:50:25] his Hunting Buddies by the name of Bert
[1:50:28] and I'm sure you all know the story of
[1:50:31] Bert if you go listen to uh hear ye him
[1:50:34] for the Brandon probably preaches it 25
[1:50:36] times and in each sermon he always
[1:50:39] mentions about bird here ye him is one
[1:50:42] of those uh sermons that I'm really into
[1:50:45] right now because it has everything to
[1:50:48] do with adoption and positionally being
[1:50:51] placed within the body and so as I was
[1:50:55] listening to this sermon the other day
[1:50:56] on the way to work brother Branham was
[1:50:58] talking about Bert and
[1:51:00] he said Bert was was a brutal man
[1:51:04] kind of evil had these little squinty
[1:51:07] eyes and everything and he would he
[1:51:10] would tell brother Branham he would say
[1:51:12] ah you're just a chicken-hearted
[1:51:14] preacher
[1:51:15] he would say Bert you're not gonna shoot
[1:51:18] that Little Fawn and and he would shoot
[1:51:20] them just on purpose just to uh to make
[1:51:23] brother Branham feel bad
[1:51:25] and so but he he enjoyed hunting with
[1:51:28] Bert for this reason because he was a
[1:51:31] good Hunter
[1:51:32] he said he never got lost he never had
[1:51:34] to go track him down you never had to
[1:51:36] worry about where he was and if he was
[1:51:37] going to say he was going to meet you at
[1:51:39] a certain place he would always be there
[1:51:41] brother Branham would have hated to hunt
[1:51:43] with me
[1:51:46] I am directionally challenged I'll get
[1:51:49] out in the woods and I'll see something
[1:51:51] and get so turned around
[1:51:55] Jesse will call me my father-in-law okay
[1:51:59] Stephen you need to Head East
[1:52:01] okay I need to go East yeah East
[1:52:06] Sun's right above me yeah East know your
[1:52:09] other East
[1:52:15] end up walking in circles
[1:52:19] but he enjoyed hunting with this guy
[1:52:22] and so there was hunting there one time
[1:52:24] and there was you know six inches of
[1:52:26] snow whatever it was on the ground and
[1:52:28] so what they would do is they would uh
[1:52:30] they would track the deer they would
[1:52:33] check track the footprints the hoof
[1:52:34] Prince whatever
[1:52:36] and so it was they he says oh we didn't
[1:52:39] get up there till late and this and that
[1:52:40] and we're eating our lunch and Bert
[1:52:42] pulls out this Little Fawn call
[1:52:45] brother Branham says oh Bert you're not
[1:52:48] surely you're not going to do that
[1:52:51] he says oh watch me he goes oh surely
[1:52:53] you won't do that but uh hell you
[1:52:56] chicken-hearted preacher you you know uh
[1:52:58] you know and this and that and one of
[1:53:01] brother Brandon's very good friends
[1:53:03] so he blows that thing
[1:53:05] 20 30 yards or whatever it was a popsus
[1:53:08] deer
[1:53:10] Mama dear
[1:53:12] wasn't a buck
[1:53:13] wasn't a little fun and here this mama
[1:53:16] deer comes out brother Bradham says I
[1:53:18] could see
[1:53:19] the brown and her deep brown eyes
[1:53:22] and she wasn't scared
[1:53:25] he says it wasn't normal for a deer to
[1:53:27] do this
[1:53:28] and he blew it again and she took a
[1:53:31] couple of walks towards the hunters
[1:53:34] and so here was Burton pulled his rifle
[1:53:37] up
[1:53:37] puts a shell in it
[1:53:40] and even with the click of the gun and
[1:53:42] all these different things had never
[1:53:44] caused that Mama deer to run off why was
[1:53:47] that because she thought that she had a
[1:53:50] fawn in distress
[1:53:54] that's what real mamas do
[1:53:57] real mamas whenever their kids are in
[1:53:59] distress guess what they're not ready to
[1:54:01] bounce
[1:54:02] but they're ready to stand there and
[1:54:04] take the punishment
[1:54:07] and so here he was he pulls his gun up
[1:54:10] and brother Branham said he turns away
[1:54:12] he says all any moment now I know his
[1:54:15] Scopes is on her his scope is on her and
[1:54:18] he's just gonna blow her heart out Plumb
[1:54:20] through the other side and he said I
[1:54:22] waited and I waited and I just kept
[1:54:25] thinking about that little old mama he
[1:54:27] says and all of a sudden I turned round
[1:54:29] and Bert said his gun in the ground and
[1:54:31] he started crying he says oh bill lead
[1:54:36] me to that Jesus that you keep telling
[1:54:39] me about
[1:54:43] and I begin to think about this story
[1:54:46] and I thought out of all the times that
[1:54:48] brother Branham had went hunting with
[1:54:50] this man no doubt he witnessed and no
[1:54:52] doubt he testified but there was there
[1:54:55] was nothing that brother Branham could
[1:54:57] say that would make him change his mind
[1:54:59] and change his heart but brother Branham
[1:55:02] said that Bert saw something real
[1:55:05] within that deer and it was something
[1:55:08] that he wanted it was something that he
[1:55:12] wanted so badly he didn't even know he
[1:55:14] wanted it until that point he saw
[1:55:17] something that was real within that Mama
[1:55:20] dear
[1:55:23] what was it
[1:55:25] it was love
[1:55:28] the Bible says that no greater love has
[1:55:31] a man than this then he lays down his
[1:55:34] life for
[1:55:38] he saw the love of that deer that she
[1:55:41] was willing to sacrifice her life in
[1:55:44] order to find her Fawn that was in
[1:55:47] distress it was something real that
[1:55:50] caught the attention of bird and it
[1:55:52] grasped his heart and when he seen it he
[1:55:56] knew that that's what brother Branham
[1:55:57] had amen
[1:56:00] my brother my sister
[1:56:02] that's what we need to go back to
[1:56:06] you not pointing the fingers
[1:56:09] not chastising not saying this that or
[1:56:12] the other but a genuine love
[1:56:16] of unadulterated Christian love sent
[1:56:21] from God that we would serve one another
[1:56:24] with a pure heart and sincerity and
[1:56:28] generosity that those around us could
[1:56:31] see and feel the love that we have for
[1:56:33] one another
[1:56:39] how do we get back to that
[1:56:41] through humility
[1:56:43] how do we get back to that by saying I'm
[1:56:46] sorry how do we get back to that when we
[1:56:49] see a need that we reach out and we meet
[1:56:52] the need
[1:56:54] as the musicians come
[1:56:59] he saw
[1:57:01] something that was real
[1:57:05] he saw something that was
[1:57:07] genuine
[1:57:10] and it's something that is missing
[1:57:12] within the ranks of the message
[1:57:16] a true genuine love
[1:57:19] for one another
[1:57:22] a true genuine
[1:57:29] of humility
[1:57:32] not Pride
[1:57:35] we've been walking in Pride for way too
[1:57:37] long
[1:57:42] with our nose noses stuck up in the air
[1:57:46] arguing over who's the best Church
[1:57:50] arguing over who's the best song leaders
[1:57:52] who's
[1:57:53] who's got this who's got that
[1:57:56] I guess guess what everybody sees it
[1:58:00] ah tit for tatin this for that and they
[1:58:04] said this and we'll say that and
[1:58:07] this person over here and that person
[1:58:09] over there
[1:58:11] this is happening and now there's
[1:58:13] contentions everywhere
[1:58:15] how do you think this makes the youth
[1:58:17] feel
[1:58:19] how does it make the youth feel amongst
[1:58:21] the churches
[1:58:23] when they see all the contentions that's
[1:58:25] going on amongst the Bride of Jesus
[1:58:28] Christ right now
[1:58:29] how does it make you feel
[1:58:32] [Music]
[1:58:34] it's the devil
[1:58:37] plain and simple
[1:58:41] bringing a division
[1:58:43] amongst people
[1:58:45] bringing a division amongst families
[1:58:48] bringing a division amongst churches
[1:58:51] divisions contentions fightings
[1:58:55] it's not Christianity
[1:58:58] it's not how we're supposed to serve one
[1:59:01] another
[1:59:03] if we don't agree hey that's okay
[1:59:06] as far as East ends from the West yeah
[1:59:08] but let's not be disagreeable one from
[1:59:11] with the other
[1:59:12] [Music]
[1:59:14] the reason that people are disagreeable
[1:59:17] is because of pride in our lives
[1:59:21] that raises up and says I'm right
[1:59:29] and it's causing contentions
[1:59:37] it's not good
[1:59:40] shouldn't be so
[1:59:44] brother Stephen
[1:59:45] what are we going to do about it
[1:59:47] somebody's got to do something about it
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:54] so why can't we
[1:59:57] as a congregation lead by example
[2:00:05] when there's contentions all around and
[2:00:10] this one's saying this and this and that
[2:00:12] or whatever
[2:00:14] how about we just turn around and say
[2:00:16] you know what
[2:00:17] maybe I was wrong
[2:00:20] forgive me
[2:00:24] how about we
[2:00:26] instead of
[2:00:28] an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[2:00:30] tooth and slap me I'll slap you how
[2:00:32] about we say hey
[2:00:34] go ahead
[2:00:36] I'll turn my cheek
[2:00:38] I'll hold my tongue
[2:00:40] because you're my brother
[2:00:45] we have the same father
[2:00:51] but it's got to start here
[2:00:56] otherwise
[2:00:58] where does it stop
[2:01:02] where does it stop
[2:01:04] as a congregation amongst each other
[2:01:07] and where does it stop as the body of
[2:01:11] Jesus Christ
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:15] could I be so bold and say
[2:01:18] that it stops now
[2:01:24] that it stops right here
[2:01:27] and that the change starts
[2:01:30] right here
[2:01:32] and that the change starts right now
[2:01:35] that the change starts in my heart
[2:01:40] and then that it starts in your heart
[2:01:44] and the nonsense then
[2:01:48] stops the contentions come to an end
[2:01:53] and then we can really move on with God
[2:01:58] all of us as a body around the world the
[2:02:01] body of Jesus Christ
[2:02:04] we have one objective
[2:02:06] and that's to find the last soul
[2:02:09] [Music]
[2:02:13] to find them and to bring them into the
[2:02:15] body for them to take their place in
[2:02:17] their position within the body of Christ
[2:02:19] then the Rapture will happen
[2:02:23] but until that time
[2:02:26] they have a work to do
[2:02:28] until that time we need to get back to
[2:02:31] our foundational teachings
[2:02:34] of servitude
[2:02:35] [Music]
[2:02:45] servant
[2:02:46] is to serve when it's not convenient
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:54] ah
[2:02:57] I have time
[2:02:59] I don't have time to reach out I don't
[2:03:01] have time to do this I don't know yeah
[2:03:03] make time
[2:03:06] there's some people are very good at it
[2:03:08] and others we're not so good
[2:03:13] how about we step up our standard
[2:03:18] I believe
[2:03:19] I do
[2:03:21] I believe if we can get rid of this
[2:03:24] Pride within assemblies and within
[2:03:27] ourselves and
[2:03:29] and if we can
[2:03:31] acknowledge it when we see it
[2:03:33] and apologize when it happens that God
[2:03:37] will really begin to move in your heart
[2:03:40] as an individual and in our services as
[2:03:44] a collective body
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:47] and then Watch What Happens
[2:03:51] then we say the supernatural
[2:03:54] then we catch the moving of God then we
[2:03:58] see when God is dealing with hearts then
[2:04:00] we see we're not like Peter and rebuking
[2:04:02] them and saying Lord Lord stop no
[2:04:04] there's something spiritual going on and
[2:04:07] not only will we see it but will be a
[2:04:09] part of it
[2:04:11] but until that time
[2:04:14] we have to change
[2:04:24] Heavenly Father Lord
[2:04:26] thank you
[2:04:27] kind of cut up
[2:04:29] Norden everything but I prayed a little
[2:04:33] boy one time he
[2:04:35] he prayed and
[2:04:36] and Lord he was
[2:04:38] saying his ABCs
[2:04:43] and a little Jimmy Lord and
[2:04:45] and father he had faith that you would
[2:04:48] put the word the letters together to
[2:04:50] make words to understand what he was
[2:04:52] trying to say
[2:04:55] Lord may this sermon this morning
[2:04:59] we had Captivate our hearts Lord
[2:05:02] and made me realize father God it's an
[2:05:05] issue that we all deal with Lord every
[2:05:08] human being around the world but now
[2:05:11] that it's been exposed and everything
[2:05:15] Lord I pray you would put all these
[2:05:16] little pieces together
[2:05:18] and Lord father that
[2:05:21] he would bring the thought across to our
[2:05:24] hearts Lord
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:28] you know my heart
[2:05:30] and I have no agenda
[2:05:33] Lord I have
[2:05:35] I have no agenda of Correction
[2:05:39] father I just preached what I felt you
[2:05:42] put on my heart
[2:05:44] and Lord I pray that
[2:05:46] it'll have an effect because your word
[2:05:49] says that it will not return void
[2:05:53] bless your people your children touch
[2:05:56] our pastor Lord may this operation that
[2:06:00] was done Lord
