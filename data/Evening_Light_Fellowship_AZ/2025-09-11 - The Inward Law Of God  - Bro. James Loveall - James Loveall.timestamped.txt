[7:50] how to grow in beauty in God sight.

[8:38] Anywhere you open up the door.

[8:54] Show me what I've never seen
[8:59] before.
[9:02] Oh
[9:05] Lord,
[9:06] I want to be a witness
[9:10] that you can take what's wrong and make
[9:14] it right. Do you believe that?
[9:18] [Music]
[9:22] Oh day star, shine down on me.
[9:27] Let your love shine through me in the
[9:31] night.
[9:33] [Music]
[9:38] Lord, I see a world that's dying,
[9:43] wounded by the master of DC.
[9:48] [Music]
[9:56] Roing in the darkness,
[10:00] haunted by the years of past defeat.
[10:05] [Music]
[10:10] Oh,
[10:11] but then I see near me
[10:16] shining with compassion in your eyes.

[11:20] You can take what's wrong and make it
[11:24] right.
[11:27] [Music]

[11:36] Let your love shine through me in the
[11:40] night.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just want his love to shine
[11:45] down on us this evening.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have one praise report turned
[11:49] in and one prayer request. We'll read
[11:51] our praise report first. This is from
[11:54] Sister Melody. She writes, "My son works
[11:56] for a call center that takes donations
[11:58] for different conservative causes. And
[12:00] one woman he talked to is a Jewish
[12:02] message believer who was so impressed by
[12:04] my son David that she gave $800 to the
[12:07] company. She wanted him to tell me that
[12:09] I raised him right and wanted to ask
[12:12] God's blessing for me. So thankful to
[12:14] hear this as my son is not where he
[12:15] should be spiritually. It blessed him a
[12:17] lot. So we thank the Lord for that."
[12:19] Praise report from Sister Melody.
[12:23] Brother Brian has noted down, please
[12:24] pray for sister Sarah. She really hurt
[12:26] her back and needs a touch from the
[12:29] master's hand.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Stephen, if you could
[12:32] come open our word, our service in a
[12:35] word of prayer. Sure. Uh, brother Steven
[12:38] McNeely. Yes. I'm sure many of you heard
[12:40] uh Charlie Kirk, Christian political
[12:43] figure, was murdered today. So wife and
[12:46] two kids. So just have that on my heart
[12:49] as well. If we could pray for the
[12:50] family.
[12:55] Let's bow our hearts. Father God, we
[12:57] have gathered here this evening, Lord,
[13:00] with a desire to hear from you. Lord,
[13:03] your prophet taught us that whatever we
[13:05] come with a desire or an expectation
[13:07] that you would come and you would
[13:08] fulfill that expectation.
[13:11] And so, Father God, I pray that by the
[13:13] foolishness of preaching, Lord, by the
[13:16] open word book, that you would come and
[13:18] speak to our hearts and that you would
[13:20] change our lives, Lord. For that's our
[13:22] main desire. Father, we see our country
[13:26] and the things that's going on around
[13:28] the world and Charlie Kirk and the
[13:30] assassination. We ask that you would
[13:32] bring comfort to his family, his wife,
[13:36] Lord, his two young children. Father
[13:39] God, a widow and fatherless by some
[13:44] silly act, Lord,
[13:46] &gt;&gt; by silly politics, Father. Lord, I just
[13:49] pray comfort and Father God, that you
[13:53] would just be with
[13:56] not only that family, but the
[13:58] surrounding family, the people that were
[14:00] there and shaken up and so on and so
[14:03] forth. Lord, what a tragedy. But we're
[14:06] here tonight, Father God. And Lord, I
[14:08] pray that you would be with Brother
[14:10] James and that you would touch him.
[14:12] Father, that you would inspire him and
[14:15] anoint him with your spirit. Father,
[14:17] that there would be a connection between
[14:20] us and him and your Holy Spirit, Lord.
[14:22] That your word would have an effect. Be
[14:25] with Brother Jonathan, father, as he
[14:27] leads us in worship. May we set aside,
[14:29] Lord, the cares of this life, the cares
[14:32] of this world. Whatever day we've had,
[14:35] Lord, may you help us to lay it aside
[14:37] now and to fully concentrate upon thee
[14:41] and to worship thee with a thankful
[14:43] heart. Lord, we commit our lives and our
[14:46] family, our church, and everything into
[14:48] thy hands for thy kingdom's glory. We
[14:51] ask these things in Jesus Christ's name.
[14:54] Amen.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:57] Amen. Why don't you shake your
[14:58] neighbor's hand as you're taking your
[15:00] seat this evening? Amen. Let's go up to
[15:02] B flat. Just a closer walk with thee.
[15:05] Amen.
[15:09] Just a closer walk with thee.
[15:16] Granted,
[15:18] Jesus is my plea.
[15:22] [Music]
[15:22] [Applause]
[15:24] daily
[15:25] walking closely.
[15:28] [Applause]
[15:30] Let it be.
[15:32] Dear Lord, let it be.
[15:37] Well, I
[15:39] am weak, but thou art strong.
[15:43] [Applause]
[15:44] [Music]
[15:45] Jesus,
[15:47] keep me from all wrong.
[15:52] And I'll be satisfied
[15:56] as long
[15:59] as I walk. Let me walk close to thee.
[16:04] [Applause]
[16:05] [Music]
[16:06] Well, just a closer walk with thee.
[16:14] Oh,

[16:35] Well, through this world of toilet
[16:39] snares.
[16:41] [Music]
[16:43] Oh, if I falter, Lord, who cares?
[16:48] [Music]
[16:48] [Applause]
[16:51] Oh, with thee my burden shares.
[16:57] None but thee,
[16:59] dear Lord. None but thee.
[17:04] Well, just a closer walk with thee.
[17:14] Jesus is my plea.
[17:18] [Music]
[17:20] daily
[17:21] walking close to thee.
[17:26] Let it be,
[17:28] dear Lord. Let it be.
[17:33] Well, when
[17:35] my feeble life is over,
[17:41] time for me will be no more.
[17:47] [Music]
[17:48] Guide me daily gently, safely. Oh,
[17:54] to thy shomom
[17:57] shore to thy shore.
[18:02] Well, just a closer walk with thee.
[18:08] [Music]
[18:11] Jesus is my plea.
[18:16] daily
[18:18] walking close to thee.
[18:22] Let it be,
[18:25] dear Lord. Let it be.
[18:28] Amen. Just give him a hand clap and
[18:30] praise this evening.
[18:32] Well, when we all
[18:35] get to heaven,
[18:38] what a day of rejoicing that will be
[18:44] when we all
[18:47] see Jesus.

[18:56] when we all
[18:58] get to heaven.
[19:02] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[19:07] when we all
[19:10] see Jesus.
[19:13] We'll sing and shout the victory one
[19:17] more time. Well, when we all
[19:22] get together,
[19:25] what day of rejoicing that will be
[19:30] when we all
[19:33] see Jesus
[19:36] will sing and shout the victory.
[19:41] Amen. Give him another hand clap of
[19:43] praise this evening. Amen. And we can
[19:46] all stand as we get ready to change the
[19:47] order of the service. Let's just sing
[19:50] even so come Lord Jesus.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's just been on my heart
[19:54] today. Just such a dark world we live
[19:55] in.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; I just said Lord it's time. Just take us
[19:59] home Father.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Even so

[20:48] even so.
[20:52] Come Lord Jesus.

[21:18] all
[21:22] [Music]

[23:06] Why would I worry when giants come
[23:10] calling my name?
[23:15] Oh my God is so much bigger than
[23:20] troubles I face. Can you say amen to
[23:24] that?
[23:26] Oh, why would I hunger for power,
[23:31] riches, or fame?
[23:36] Oh my God is so much better than all of
[23:42] these things.
[23:46] So I won't be shen.

[24:02] His promise is true.
[24:07] So I speak to the mountain.
[24:10] [Music]
[24:13] It's time to move.
[24:18] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[24:24] greater than you.
[24:27] Amen.
[24:29] Oh, my enemies scatter cuz they know the
[24:34] battle is done.
[24:37] Victory's already won. Oh, my God is
[24:42] stronger. The victory
[24:45] already won.
[24:47] [Music]
[24:50] Yeah. He died for my ransom and rose up
[24:55] on the third day.
[25:01] Oh my God is stronger than death. Hell
[25:06] and the grave.
[25:11] Oh, I won't be sh.
[25:16] Oh, I won't be moved.
[25:22] My God is faithful.
[25:25] [Music]
[25:27] His promise is true.
[25:31] Speak to the mountain. So I'll speak to
[25:34] the mountain.
[25:38] It's time to move.
[25:44] For my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[25:49] greater than you.
[25:57] There's no mountain to high, no valley
[26:01] to low. There's no fear that I have. He
[26:05] doesn't already know. There's no problem
[26:09] to fix. There's no weapon too strong.
[26:13] There is nothing for God that's
[26:16] impossible.
[26:18] There's no mountain to high, no valley
[26:23] to go. There's no fear that I have. He
[26:27] doesn't already know. There's no problem
[26:31] to make. There's no weapon too strong.
[26:35] There is nothing for God that's
[26:38] impossible.
[26:39] [Music]
[26:44] Oh, I won't be shen.
[26:49] Oh, I won't be moved.
[26:55] My God is faithful.
[27:00] His promise is true.
[27:05] So I speak to the mountain.
[27:11] Oh, it's time to move.
[27:17] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[27:23] greater than you.
[27:27] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise this
[27:29] evening.
[27:34] [Music]
[27:36] He's bigger. He's stronger. He's better.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; He's greater than any trial that we'll
[27:42] ever go through, any valley.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Our God is faithful.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Our God is faithful. Somebody say,
[27:50] "Faithful."
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Faithful.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; He's an everpresent help in the time of
[27:58] need.
[28:00] He said, "My arm is not too sure."
[28:03] [Music]
[28:05] &gt;&gt; We have not because we ask not.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Take God at his word and see what he'll
[28:11] do.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; And I believe that if you make time for
[28:15] God, God will make time for you.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; You begin to ask,
[28:19] &gt;&gt; you begin to seek,
[28:21] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something, you will find
[28:23] him.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; You begin to knock and the door will be
[28:26] open.
[28:27] things will begin to happen in your
[28:29] life.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, it might not happen how you think it
[28:34] will.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we ask God for an answer.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; And we ask and we ask and he doesn't
[28:45] give it right away,
[28:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[28:47] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we just need to change our
[28:49] approach and say, "God,
[28:51] &gt;&gt; just send a little word.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Send a song by my way. send some word of
[28:56] encouragement to let let me know that
[28:58] you're with me.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads before him if
[29:04] you have a need.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, how thankful we are for this
[29:14] opportunity once again to be gathered in
[29:16] your house, Lord.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, not taking for granted this
[29:20] opportunity, Lord. Lord, this world is
[29:23] falling apart and people are doing
[29:25] things that are insane and
[29:28] assassinations and things for what they
[29:30] believe in and what they stand for.
[29:41] revelation and understanding. And
[29:44] Father, we have gathered on this
[29:45] Wednesday night.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, would you come and just walk with
[29:51] us, Lord,
[29:53] &gt;&gt; as you did in the beginning with Adam
[29:55] and Eve in the cool of the evening,
[29:57] Father, and Lord, the word would go
[30:00] forth and that it would bring forth
[30:01] life.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; It would bring a freedom. It would bring
[30:04] a liberty. Oh God,
[30:07] have your way in this service. Lord,
[30:10] &gt;&gt; oh Lord,
[30:10] &gt;&gt; we thank you for this opportunity. We
[30:13] thank you for this word. We thank you
[30:15] for a prophet in this day. Oh God,
[30:18] &gt;&gt; we thank you for revelation and Isa to
[30:21] see. Lord,
[30:23] we just ask now and Lord, we set
[30:26] ourselves aside once again.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, we humble ourselves in your
[30:31] presence. Lord,
[30:33] &gt;&gt; have your way. Speak to your children
[30:36] &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name.
[30:39] Amen. And amen.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles,
[30:48] &gt;&gt; let's turn to Romans 7.
[30:54] Romans 7 and verse 12. And we're going
[30:56] to kind of skip through a few scriptures
[30:59] here just to save time and highlight a
[31:02] few here.
[31:06] Amen.
[31:11] Romans 7 and verse 12 says, "Wherefore
[31:14] the law is holy and the commandment holy
[31:17] and just and good."
[31:21] And verse 18, "For I know that in me
[31:23] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[31:26] thing. For to will is present with me,
[31:28] but how to perform that which is good I
[31:31] find not. For the good that I would, I
[31:34] do not. But the evil which I would not
[31:36] that I do.
[31:38] Now if I do that I would not. It is no
[31:41] more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
[31:44] in me.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; I find then a law that when I do good,
[31:50] evil is present with me.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; For I delight in the law of God after
[31:58] the inward man. Amen.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; But I see another law in my members,
[32:02] waring against the law of my mind and
[32:05] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[32:08] sin which is my members. Oh wretched man
[32:11] that I am. Who shall deliver me from
[32:14] this body, the body of this death? Let's
[32:19] turn to Zechariah
[32:22] chapter 7
[32:24] back between Habacook and Malachi.
[32:36] Zachchariah
[32:38] 7 and verse 8.
[32:41] And the word of the Lord came unto
[32:43] Zachchariah, saying, Thus speaketh the
[32:45] Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true
[32:48] judgment, and show mercy and compassion
[32:51] every man to his brother, and oppress
[32:53] not the widows, nor the fathers, the
[32:55] strangers, nor the poor, and let none of
[32:58] you imagine evil against his brother in
[33:01] his heart. Now, I want to stop there
[33:03] because it was just something special
[33:05] that as I begin to study and this
[33:07] thought was placed upon my heart and I
[33:09] believe that God speak to us in ways
[33:12] that it can be in devotion, it can be
[33:14] driving down the the road in a song, it
[33:16] can come by some way.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; And as I begin to look into this subject
[33:21] here and this this scripture, it was
[33:23] just in a morning devotion. I just
[33:25] opened my Bible and this is where it
[33:26] came to. And it was something so special
[33:29] because if you read the first verse of
[33:30] this chapter, it would begin to say in
[33:32] the fourth law of the reign of this, but
[33:34] on the fourth day of the ninth month and
[33:36] whenever I looked and I seen it was that
[33:38] day of September and you begin to look
[33:42] at certain things that God speaks to
[33:44] you. But I see here that the Lord begins
[33:47] to say, "Execute true judgment. Show
[33:50] mercy and compassion every man to his
[33:52] brother." And as a minister and ones
[33:54] that get behind the pulpit, you want to
[33:56] that's what you want to do. You want to
[33:58] preach the gospel, but you want to show
[34:00] true judgment and you want to have mercy
[34:02] and compassion and you want to preach it
[34:04] in such a way and you want to show
[34:06] grace, but yet there is a law to it.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen what happens here that
[34:11] when the people if they don't listen
[34:15] &gt;&gt; in verse 11 it says but they refused to
[34:17] hearken and pulled away the shoulder and
[34:20] stopped their ears that they should not
[34:23] hear. Yay they made their hearts as anam
[34:28] stone lest they should hear the law and
[34:31] the words which the Lord of hosts hath
[34:34] sent in his spirit by former prophets.
[34:37] Therefore came a great wrath from the
[34:40] Lord of hosts. You see what happens
[34:43] whenever you disobey and you put away
[34:46] the laws of God. You don't hearken to
[34:49] the voices of the prophets.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; There comes something from God. And I
[34:55] and I begin to understand and as I was
[34:57] even praying that that morning
[35:00] that no matter who's preaching, no
[35:02] matter the prophets that speak,
[35:05] &gt;&gt; no matter what words are being spoken or
[35:08] prophesied, there is a people that will
[35:10] not hearken unto the words.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; It's happened in every age. There's been
[35:14] an age that, you know, every age the
[35:16] word goes forth and there's been a
[35:18] people that won't hearken to the voice
[35:20] of God, that will turn away after their
[35:22] own lust, that won't do the laws that
[35:24] God has commanded them to do.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; But I also believe and I read not only
[35:30] in my Bible, but this day, there is a
[35:33] group of people that will hearken to the
[35:34] voice, that will obey the voices of the
[35:37] prophet. Can you say, "I'm going to be
[35:39] obedient to the word of God. I'm going
[35:42] to hearken to the prophet's voices.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; We want to execute true judgment, show
[35:50] mercy, and have compassion. You can be
[35:54] seated this evening.
[36:00] And the subject we'd like to take here
[36:04] is the law, the inward law of God.
[36:08] The inward law of God. And you know, it
[36:11] was something that brother Ron began to
[36:13] touch on this here on communion if you
[36:15] were here that he began to talk about
[36:18] Paul, the chiefest of sinners,
[36:21] that he said, "I find a law within my
[36:23] members."
[36:25] &gt;&gt; But there was a law that we can delight
[36:27] in, and it was a law after the inward
[36:29] man.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; And this law after the inward man is not
[36:34] based upon the flesh. It's not based
[36:36] upon the spirit realms. Why? Because the
[36:39] spirit realm and the in the flesh realm
[36:41] is based upon senses and it has emotions
[36:44] and conditions attached to it. And you
[36:46] can be swayed one way or the other, but
[36:48] there's an inward man that we can
[36:50] delight in
[36:51] &gt;&gt; that it's steady. It's consistent. It's
[36:53] true to God's word.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; There are laws of God that are given to
[37:02] man that we we must abide by. And there
[37:06] are laws given by man which are given to
[37:08] other men that we abide by in this day.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Is it not so that whenever you come and
[37:14] you get in your car, you got to abide by
[37:16] the speed limit.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; You got to drive according to the laws.
[37:19] You got to drive according to the
[37:21] traffic lights. If there's a stop sign,
[37:23] you got to stop.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; You're abiding by the law.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Most of us were law law-abiding
[37:30] citizens.
[37:32] We do our best.
[37:36] And then there's some that the speed
[37:39] limit is just a suggestion.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; It's a recommended uh uh speed to go and
[37:45] you live and you push the law and you
[37:48] live in the boundary and the grace of a
[37:50] officer,
[37:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:52] Meaning that if you drive, we could say
[37:54] 10 miles over. And what if he was to
[37:56] pull you over and it the speed limit was
[37:59] 75 and you're going 80 and he pulled you
[38:01] over and he said, "I'm pulling you over
[38:03] for speeding." And you would say, "Well,
[38:05] I thought there was a 10 mph grace
[38:07] period,
[38:10] but it's based upon what he wants to
[38:12] give you."
[38:13] &gt;&gt; But now you're living without the
[38:15] boundaries of the law. And when you
[38:17] begin to live outside the boundaries of
[38:19] the laws and the things that God has
[38:21] given us, there could be problems.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; It's true, brother.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; You know, naturally, when you train a
[38:33] young man to drive and you get a you get
[38:35] into the car and you begin to teach them
[38:38] and they're not very comfortable behind
[38:40] the wheel, what do they begin to do?
[38:41] They they abide by all the laws. 10 and
[38:44] two, drive at a certain speed, use the
[38:47] blinker, stop so many seconds at a
[38:49] stoplight or stop sign. You do all these
[38:52] things. Why? Because you it's
[38:55] unfamiliar, but you're learning the the
[38:57] reigns of the laws, you know, but then
[38:59] the more you drive and the more
[39:00] comfortable you get, what do you do? You
[39:03] begin to push the law.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; You begin to speed a little bit. You
[39:06] begin to do a little California stop,
[39:09] maybe look both ways.
[39:13] Oh, we're all guilty of it.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[39:18] I know we've all had nature changes, but
[39:22] &gt;&gt; the flesh man is still there.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; But you see that Satan also has laws.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Satan has laws that he begins to input
[39:37] into society. Yeah.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; And these laws are not laws that he
[39:42] could create on his own because we know
[39:43] that he is not a creator.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; He could not come up with a law and say
[39:47] this is what you're going to do. But
[39:48] what does he do? He begins to pervert
[39:50] laws
[39:52] &gt;&gt; that God had and he begins to pervert
[39:54] these laws into ways that would would
[39:57] glorify him or ways that he would be
[40:00] able to utilize these laws.
[40:03] Yeah,
[40:04] &gt;&gt; you can take the human race from the
[40:06] very beginning
[40:08] &gt;&gt; and God had laws and you mean man and
[40:11] woman, but what does Satan come and do?
[40:13] He begins to come and he begins to
[40:15] pervert that law.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; He begins to say that you can have a
[40:19] same-sex marriage and you by science you
[40:21] can change your sexuality and you can do
[40:23] all these things. What is he doing? He's
[40:25] perverting the very laws that God has
[40:27] given us.
[40:33] And if he can't pervert the law, what
[40:35] does he do?
[40:36] &gt;&gt; He changes the law.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Have you noticed that over time laws
[40:42] begin to change?
[40:45] &gt;&gt; And I'll just say this that God creates
[40:47] laws even for nature
[40:51] and nature for all these thousands of
[40:53] years
[40:55] and they've never had to change.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:00] Why is it when God created in the
[41:02] beginning and he spoke the whole world
[41:05] and he said all these things will bring
[41:07] forth after their own kind.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell a tree to bring
[41:11] forth a fruit.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; That tree is going to bring forth
[41:14] whatever's inside of it.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; It's the law of God. Whatever you plant,
[41:17] you're going to reap. Whatever you sew,
[41:20] that's what you're going to reap. It's a
[41:21] law of God. Yeah.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; And so these things in nature, you don't
[41:25] have to tell an animal when it comes to
[41:27] the time to breeding or that that time
[41:30] of of during the rut, you deer hunters
[41:32] and it's this time of rut. You don't
[41:33] have to tell the the male deer, okay,
[41:35] now is the season that you have to go
[41:37] for the females. No, it's something in
[41:39] its nature.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; It's a law of God that he put inside
[41:42] that deer.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; He even told the animals to multiply and
[41:48] replenish the earth. He told him,
[41:51] &gt;&gt; "Make them after your own kind."
[41:55] &gt;&gt; And so we see that these laws are in
[41:57] effect, but yet Satan comes and what
[41:59] does he do? He begins to pervert the
[42:01] law. And if you can't pervert it, he
[42:03] changes the law.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Now you can marry a uh you have the
[42:08] same-sex marriages.
[42:10] You can marry an animal if you want.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Back then you would never even think of
[42:16] it. It was never even in a law book.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; You could never comprehend what that is.
[42:22] But now we're living in such a dark time
[42:25] &gt;&gt; that now he's got to create laws. As
[42:28] time goes on, he's perverting these
[42:30] laws. And if the laws don't make way,
[42:32] he's going to make way for those laws to
[42:34] come to pass. Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; And I was even reading this thing on
[42:40] that guy that he had shot those the the
[42:43] the mass murderer, the one that killed
[42:45] those couple of kids while they were
[42:47] praying.
[42:49] And he he was a transgender
[42:51] and he was whatever you would call it,
[42:54] but his partner was a furry who wanted
[42:56] to be an animal. And you see all this
[42:58] perversion and in his manifest or
[43:00] whatever they call it at the end of his
[43:02] life
[43:04] they had said they had read that he wish
[43:07] he would have never done it. He wish he
[43:09] wouldn't have never changed. He wish he
[43:11] would have listened.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not a law of God. It's
[43:15] not natural for men to think like that
[43:18] and do those things and live that way.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; But what Satan does is he'll take you
[43:22] farther than you want to go. He wants to
[43:24] He will start with a little this and a
[43:27] little that and it says, "Oh, it's not
[43:28] too bad."
[43:30] &gt;&gt; It starts with one word.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; It starts with one thought. It starts
[43:33] with one little thing.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; True.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; And look where they end up.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says in the
[43:42] fundamental foundation for faith. He
[43:44] says, "Now Satan by the laws of sin and
[43:47] death makes everything that sin and
[43:49] death bought operate." He says, "And
[43:52] Satan sends a cancer and the man
[43:55] recognizes it and receives it." Satan
[43:58] sends heartache. We recognize it and
[44:00] receive it.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Let me stop there. You don't have to
[44:04] receive it.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the doctor said. I
[44:07] don't care what has been given to you.
[44:09] You don't have to receive what Satan has
[44:11] sent you
[44:12] &gt;&gt; because that's not a law of God. No.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; And if Satan by his power can make his
[44:20] laws work in man, how much more ought
[44:22] God with his power make his laws work in
[44:25] man?
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; If Satan can make his laws be sure and
[44:29] us recognize it.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Listen, in us recognize it. Too many
[44:33] times we're recognizing the laws of
[44:35] Satan.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; We're putting too too much emphasis on
[44:39] the things of Satan,
[44:41] &gt;&gt; all these laws, and we get distracted.
[44:43] But listen what he says. If we can
[44:45] recognize what Satan's doing, how much
[44:48] more ought God through his children to
[44:51] make his laws be recognized amongst his
[44:53] people? A divine healing and revelation
[44:56] and power and gifts and manifestations
[44:59] of the spirit.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Those are the laws that we should be
[45:03] recognizing. Those are the things that
[45:05] should attract our attention.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Because you see, there is a reality to
[45:11] this message. Yes.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; There is a reality to this message. It's
[45:15] just not a hope so or a theory or or
[45:18] Bible stud studies or stories that we
[45:21] read long ago. That's not what this
[45:23] message is about.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; It's so much more than law and letter of
[45:28] the law.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; And dos and don'ts and regulations.
[45:32] There's so much more to this message.
[45:34] Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; There's a life that can be lived behind
[45:42] the Christian life.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; It's not if you do these laws or you do
[45:47] you live this way or you obey your
[45:49] parents this way or you be obedient in
[45:52] such a way and it becomes a cookie
[45:54] cutter religion. Uh-uh.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; It's not if you say these prayers or or
[46:04] or give this much or be this person. No,
[46:06] that's a religion.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this evening, you're not
[46:09] bound by a religion.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; You're not You're not here because of a
[46:13] religion. But you're here because of a
[46:15] love affair, of a relationship with
[46:17] Jesus Christ.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; It's because I'm in love with him is why
[46:23] I do the things that I do. Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; That's why I go to church. That's why I
[46:27] serve God.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; It's because I'm in love with him.
[46:30] Brother Brandham says, "I don't do this
[46:32] in fear that he would send me to hell.
[46:34] That's not why I do this. I serve him
[46:36] because I love him.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; It's just like me and my wife. I love
[46:40] her. I don't want to hurt her. I don't
[46:42] want to harm her.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; She doesn't have to worry about it.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; We just celebrated seven wonderful
[46:48] years. Has there been ups? Has there
[46:50] been downs?" Absolutely. But when you're
[46:52] in love with somebody, it doesn't matter
[46:54] what comes, what goes,
[46:56] &gt;&gt; you're in love.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; It's because the you have a love with
[47:09] Jesus Christ.
[47:11] Let me ask you this question
[47:15] that if this was all that life was
[47:17] cracked up to be, if there was no
[47:20] afterlife, it wasn't based on anything
[47:22] after this, if it was yolo, as the kids
[47:25] would say, you only live once and this
[47:28] is all that it has, would you still
[47:30] serve God?
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Would you still serve God? Would you
[47:34] still come to church and be faithful and
[47:37] do all these things and live the way
[47:39] that you are?
[47:41] Yes, sir.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Because let me put it this way. Because
[47:44] if there's a desire or or a wondering if
[47:47] am I missing out on this or that or I
[47:50] wish I could be this way or I can do
[47:52] those things and I can go to those
[47:54] parties or I can enjoy the the the the
[47:56] things of life,
[47:58] &gt;&gt; something's wrong.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; You're not fully in love with him.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Because my love isn't based on what he's
[48:06] done for me, saints.
[48:08] It's not based on what he's done for me.
[48:10] I know what it's like to be a sinner. I
[48:13] know what it's like to be lost and to be
[48:15] full of mistakes and failures.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says while we were yet
[48:21] sinners,
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Christ died for us.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; His love for me goes far back before I
[48:27] was even a sinner. Whenever I was out in
[48:29] the world and I was doing the things of
[48:31] the world,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; his love for me,
[48:37] it wasn't like I Well, I hope he comes
[48:39] around.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I hope he falls in love with me.
[48:44] Let me tell you, and I'll get ahead of
[48:46] myself. He put a law inside of you.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; He put something inside of that, but you
[48:52] couldn't help fall in love with him.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:55] You couldn't help but fall in love with
[48:57] him.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; So true.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; You see, and so it is naturally
[49:07] that you don't fall in love with
[49:10] somebody because of what they have to
[49:12] offer you.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Don't do it, girls.
[49:17] Don't fall in love with somebody because
[49:19] this man has money or he can offer you
[49:22] things or he can give you this and he I
[49:24] can give you that. I can give you a car
[49:25] and I can build you a house. Will you
[49:27] marry me?
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Don't do it off of what he can offer
[49:31] you.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Because what happens if those things
[49:34] draw up?
[49:39] &gt;&gt; If you base it on materialistic things
[49:42] and it's not based around genuine love,
[49:47] it'll fall apart.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how do I how do I know?"
[49:51] You can ask all the millionaires. You
[49:52] can ask the billionaires. You can ask
[49:54] all these ones that have come into
[49:56] money. You watch them. They grow up
[49:58] humble beginnings, start things in their
[50:00] garage. And what happens once they make
[50:03] the money, what happens? Their marriages
[50:05] fall apart.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; What kind of love did they have?
[50:13] &gt;&gt; So, don't do it.
[50:16] Somebody tells you based on
[50:18] materialistic things, I can offer you
[50:20] this. I can give you that. That's not
[50:23] what love is about.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; That's not why you fell in love with
[50:27] Christ.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; It's a sobering thought. What if God
[50:32] never did anything again for you?
[50:36] &gt;&gt; He's done so much for me already.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; We are a blessed people.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; We have so much to be thankful for.
[50:48] I serve him because it's a love affair.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; That's why I come to church and I do
[50:56] those things.
[50:58] Brother Brandham says and I and I was
[51:00] just listening to this quote today
[51:04] and he says, "And when men and women get
[51:06] to a place and say, "Well, I really
[51:08] ought to stay home and see this good old
[51:10] play tonight." But I tell you, they'll
[51:14] think I'm backslid if I don't go down
[51:17] at church.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; And you sit there and sleep anyhow. You
[51:22] might as well have stayed home and
[51:23] looked at some something you'd enjoy
[51:25] more.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "You should have just stayed
[51:32] home
[51:33] &gt;&gt; and watched something you had enjoyed
[51:34] more."
[51:37] And something pricricked in my heart and
[51:39] was wondering is that the reason that
[51:42] Wednesday nights are not as packed is
[51:44] because they find things that they enjoy
[51:46] more
[51:49] &gt;&gt; that they enjoy more doing. And I
[51:52] understand that you can push it so hard
[51:55] and this is where the fine line is that
[51:57] there's people that that can't make it
[51:58] on a Wednesday night. There's ones that
[52:00] it makes a sacrifice. And I'm not
[52:02] preaching at you because you're here
[52:03] tonight.
[52:07] But yet you see the prophet said, "I
[52:09] wonder if they why not just stay home
[52:11] and do those things that you enjoy
[52:13] more?"
[52:15] &gt;&gt; It's very humbling.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; But then he goes on to say, "But when
[52:22] your joy becomes the Lord and the Lord
[52:24] is your joy, you can't wait. You can't
[52:27] stay away from church."
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Then we're getting somewhere. Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; That's when we're getting somewhere,
[52:32] saints,
[52:33] &gt;&gt; is when your joy becomes the Lord and
[52:35] the Lord becomes your joy. Listen, it
[52:37] don't matter if you come to church or
[52:39] you stay home. You say, "You're putting
[52:40] too much emphasis on church." Well, my
[52:42] joy is the Lord and I am the Lord. So
[52:44] everywhere I go, I'm I'm happy. I'm
[52:47] joyful.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm a Christian.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; That's what the attraction is. That's
[52:54] what pulls us to church. Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; You see, science would say and they
[53:01] would come up with this uh uh title of
[53:04] the law of attraction.
[53:07] And it says it is a belief that positive
[53:09] thoughts and emotions and actions
[53:11] attract positive experiences and
[53:13] outcomes while negative ones attract
[53:16] negative results.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; You ever been around a positive person?
[53:23] You ever talk around a positive person?
[53:26] Maybe it's a good positive Christian.
[53:28] You're around them. They're always
[53:29] uplifting you. They always make you the
[53:32] better person. They always make you that
[53:34] like your problem is not so bad.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; And they encourage you in the Lord and
[53:38] they uplift you. Why? Because there's a
[53:40] positivity around them.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; There's something that attracts you to
[53:44] that person. Those are the kind of
[53:46] friends that we need. Those are the ones
[53:48] that you need to get yourself around. If
[53:50] you find yourself finding the negative
[53:51] in everything and you come to church and
[53:53] you're negative and you go to this and
[53:55] you're negative and everything's
[53:56] negative and your whole world is falling
[53:58] apart, change your friends.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Change your law of attraction because
[54:03] there should be an attraction when you
[54:04] come to church because when God does
[54:06] something, there is an attraction.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; God always causes an attraction. Yes.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; One common framework involves the
[54:21] principle listen of the law of
[54:22] attraction. One common framework
[54:25] involves the principle of ask, believe
[54:28] and receive to manifest your desires.
[54:33] Now if science can get a hold of it and
[54:35] just general thinking of man ask believe
[54:39] and receive
[54:42] how much more as we and sons and
[54:45] daughters of God that it's so much more
[54:47] than just a law of attraction of some
[54:50] happy positive thinking
[54:52] &gt;&gt; but there's an attraction to God's word.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that attracts and draws us.
[54:57] And it should pull us into an atmosphere
[54:59] that we should be better Christians and
[55:01] more positive and and more friendly and
[55:03] more brotherly love and more grace and
[55:06] more mercy.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; It's a law of attraction.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; When God does something in the
[55:16] scripture, you can look it back that
[55:19] when he does something in the scripture,
[55:21] there's always an attraction.
[55:23] There's always something that happens
[55:25] and
[55:26] there's always a group of people
[55:29] &gt;&gt; that when this traction happens, they
[55:31] know that it's coming. Why? Because
[55:34] they're looking for the attraction.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Because there's a people on the earth
[55:39] that hear the word, whether it be
[55:40] through a prophet, and something happens
[55:43] and the manifestation is coming to pass
[55:45] and they say, "Oh, this is what the
[55:47] prophets told us would happen."
[55:50] &gt;&gt; But I heard the prophet say today, "But
[55:51] it's a It's a minority people. It's a
[55:55] small group that begins to know when
[55:57] those things are going to happen
[56:00] to recognize that when God does
[56:02] something in scripture, they say, "Oh,
[56:03] this is what the prophet spoke about."
[56:06] &gt;&gt; But let me say this, the attraction ob
[56:08] also pulls everybody else in.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; When God does something, it pulls all
[56:14] the critics in. It pulls all the haters
[56:16] in. It pulls all the skeptics. And
[56:18] everybody gets attracted to what is
[56:21] happening. Amen.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; So, don't be discouraged this evening.
[56:24] If you've come across somebody or
[56:26] something, don't be discouraged by those
[56:29] because there's an attraction to this
[56:30] message. There's an attraction. There's
[56:32] something that has happened in this day.
[56:35] A prophet has came and spoke.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by those naysayers.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; You can take it back to the Mount Carmel
[56:48] showdown.
[56:51] There was an attraction.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Let whose God is God? Let him rain down
[56:58] fire.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; What did it do? It caused all the
[57:01] people, all the other prophets,
[57:02] everybody to come
[57:04] &gt;&gt; to see whose God is God.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[57:08] &gt;&gt; When God came on the full of an ass
[57:11] and brother Brandham says the small
[57:13] people when he be to come down, there
[57:15] was a small group saying hosana, hosana.
[57:18] Why? because they knew he was coming and
[57:20] this was the manifestation of that word.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; But then it brought a bunch of
[57:25] attraction. It brought everybody.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; It brought the unbelievers. It brought
[57:29] the makeelievers. It brought the ones
[57:30] that were just coming to look and see.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; So true.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; What is the attraction?
[57:44] God always causes an attraction.
[57:49] What is the attraction tonight? Why have
[57:52] you gathered?
[57:55] Why have you gathered on the Wednesday
[57:57] night?
[57:59] It's not to just come and play church
[58:01] thing.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; That's not the attraction. It hasn't
[58:05] come to hear some good music and hear a
[58:07] man preach. That's not that.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; What is it? to hear the word of God
[58:11] &gt;&gt; that it would come forth and it would
[58:13] change our lives and that it would
[58:14] minister that we would go from this
[58:16] place a better Christian.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; That's the attraction. The attraction
[58:21] isn't some man or you know we can go
[58:23] that the attraction is Jesus Christ. Can
[58:25] I put it back?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; That's the attraction of the hour.
[58:34] So we can take it back that this law
[58:37] just isn't built on just a hopes and a
[58:40] will and a positive thinking. But this
[58:43] attraction, we can take it back to his
[58:45] word.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; And if this law of attraction takes us
[58:48] back to his word, there's got to be
[58:50] something positive to come out of it.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; You see, when you're attracted to
[58:57] something, you're focused on it.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; You're focused. Yeah.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; When you begin become attracted to a
[59:04] young brother or a young sister, you're
[59:06] attracted to them. You begin to focus on
[59:08] them. You begin to watch them. You want
[59:12] to be with them, talk with them. Why?
[59:15] Because you're focused.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Stay focused, saints.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Stay focused on the word of God. Yes.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by Satan's laws and
[59:26] things that he wants to put in our way
[59:28] and be become so easily distracted by
[59:36] &gt;&gt; in Romans 7 and 1 it says know ye not
[59:39] brethren for I speak to them that know
[59:41] the law how that the law hath dominion
[59:44] over a man as long as he liveth.
[59:49] So this law hath dominion over a man.
[59:52] But if we take it back
[59:55] to Genesis, we know that this law was
[59:58] put in place because in the beginning,
[1:00:01] God when he began to create and he
[1:00:03] created all of nature and he put all
[1:00:05] these laws in place and you can read in
[1:00:07] the first chapter that he put all of
[1:00:09] nature in order and he put them to abide
[1:00:12] by these laws.
[1:00:14] And Adam dwelt there in the in the
[1:00:16] Garden of Eden. He didn't need a book of
[1:00:19] commandments.
[1:00:21] He didn't need a law book of dos and
[1:00:23] don'ts and don't do this and don't do
[1:00:24] that. No.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was in harmony with
[1:00:28] almighty God.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Because they were all under the Holy
[1:00:32] Spirit, operating as one.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; They were all operating under the spoken
[1:00:39] word in the beginning.
[1:00:42] And so when God, the reason I can say
[1:00:45] that they were operating all as one is
[1:00:47] because Adam, when God told Adam to name
[1:00:50] the animals, he didn't have to tell him
[1:00:51] what to name. He just named them.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to tell Adam go do this
[1:00:58] and do that. No, he didn't. Why? Because
[1:01:01] he was operating under the law that was
[1:01:03] inside of him.
[1:01:07] And this law didn't have dominion over
[1:01:09] man, but man had dominion over the law
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; because there was no fall.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; But then there would come a time on the
[1:01:16] seventh day that God would begin to
[1:01:19] create and he said that God is not good
[1:01:21] that man would dwelt alone. So what did
[1:01:23] he do? He created a help meat for him.
[1:01:28] And right before that,
[1:01:30] he says, "Adam, here's one law you got
[1:01:33] to abide by. Don't eat of the tree of
[1:01:36] knowledge."
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; It's kind of amazing when you think how
[1:01:42] could man, now we know
[1:01:45] that it's the great plan of God, but
[1:01:48] humanly how could man mess it up if he's
[1:01:51] given one law.
[1:01:57] Doesn't it seem so simple?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Just don't do this one thing.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Everything you can eat freely of
[1:02:04] everything else you can do.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Everything you can do. I have given you
[1:02:08] the whole world. Just don't do this one
[1:02:10] thing.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; And yet man
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; and God's forn knowledge we know
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; but would mess it up.
[1:02:27] And so Paul takes us back to the very
[1:02:29] law here and and we're going to continue
[1:02:31] reading the scripture and he takes us
[1:02:33] back on how important this law is.
[1:02:36] Because let me say this, somebody that
[1:02:38] is in love
[1:02:40] doesn't break the law in this manner.
[1:02:42] You can take it down real quick. Because
[1:02:45] somebody that's in love, they don't just
[1:02:46] easily break this this law. When you're
[1:02:50] in love with somebody, it just doesn't
[1:02:52] happen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; When Satan in the in the beginning, it
[1:02:56] just didn't happen suddenly.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; When somebody's in love and they have a
[1:03:00] a life partner, there's something that
[1:03:02] has to happen over time. And what does
[1:03:05] it do? It draws their love away
[1:03:09] from who they're with.
[1:03:12] It begins to lose their focus on the
[1:03:15] person that they're with.
[1:03:19] She began to lose her focus
[1:03:23] and begin to lose her attraction.
[1:03:29] Let's go to verse two. For the woman
[1:03:33] which hath a husband is bound by the law
[1:03:35] to her husband so long as he liveth. But
[1:03:39] if the husband be dead, she is loosed
[1:03:42] from the law of her husband.
[1:03:44] So then, if while her husband liveth,
[1:03:46] she be married to another man, she shall
[1:03:49] be called an adulteress. But if her
[1:03:50] husband be dead, she is free from that
[1:03:53] law, so that she is no adulteress,
[1:03:56] though she be married to a man another
[1:03:58] man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye are come
[1:04:02] dead to the law by the body of Jesus
[1:04:04] Christ. Ye should be married to another,
[1:04:07] even to him who is raised from the dead,
[1:04:09] that ye should bring forth fruit unto
[1:04:12] God. For when we were in the flesh, the
[1:04:15] motions of sin which were by the law did
[1:04:18] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[1:04:20] unto death. You see, that's why you have
[1:04:23] to be born again. That's why you have to
[1:04:25] have a new birth. That's why you have to
[1:04:26] have a change. Nicodemus said, "Do
[1:04:29] should I go into my mother's womb?" No.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; But why do we have to have a death to
[1:04:34] oursel? Because Christ can't have a
[1:04:36] relationship with you if your first
[1:04:38] husband, if the first one, your first
[1:04:40] lover is still alive.
[1:04:43] Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; God would not go against his laws.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; But now we are delivered from the law
[1:04:53] that being dead wherein we are held that
[1:04:55] we should serve in the newness of spirit
[1:04:58] and not in the oldness of the letter. I
[1:05:01] think that's so beautiful that we should
[1:05:03] live in the newness of the of the spirit
[1:05:06] and not in the oldness of the letter.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; What shall we say then? Is the law sin?
[1:05:12] God forbid. Nay, I had not sinned, but
[1:05:15] law but by law, for I had not known,
[1:05:18] lest except the law hath said, thou
[1:05:21] shalt not covet.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; So we see here that law coming brings a
[1:05:27] revelation and understanding of what is
[1:05:29] sin.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; That's what revelation does.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; It begins to take things out of our
[1:05:35] lives. That whenever God brings it
[1:05:36] across our paths, what happens?
[1:05:39] Revelation comes and it pricks our heart
[1:05:41] and we take that sin out of our life and
[1:05:43] we come to the house of God and we hear
[1:05:45] the preaching of the word and as it goes
[1:05:47] forth it begins to wash us. Why? Because
[1:05:49] we are being purged and we're being
[1:05:51] washed.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; You see the law of the inward man and
[1:05:58] the newness of the spirit revelation
[1:06:01] exposes the sin in our life.
[1:06:06] Brother Brandham says in church uh the
[1:06:08] church choosing law for grace and he
[1:06:10] says if you could do one thing to save
[1:06:12] yourself then there's not one speck of
[1:06:15] grace in it.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; If you could save yourself that's why
[1:06:19] you can't tighten down the law so hard
[1:06:21] that you can't there's no grace
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; because it takes Calvary out of the
[1:06:25] whole picture.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly.
[1:06:30] But law, listen, law is what you do in
[1:06:33] regards to the grace that God has shown
[1:06:35] you by saving you.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Law is what you do in regards to the
[1:06:41] grace. What are you doing with the law
[1:06:43] that God has given you?
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; What are you doing with the law that God
[1:06:52] has given you? Because we see that as as
[1:06:55] time was that God was in the beginning
[1:06:59] and at the end and here God was but
[1:07:01] there was a a hickey in time or a valley
[1:07:03] in time as it would.
[1:07:06] And brother Brandham says everything
[1:07:08] that was born in that was born under sin
[1:07:11] and death. Everything was born under the
[1:07:14] law. So if you're born under a law
[1:07:19] and within this time you have this this
[1:07:22] thing and it comes across and there's a
[1:07:24] little hickey in a chasm and everything
[1:07:26] that was born within it was pulled into
[1:07:29] the law of gravity
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; was pulled into the law of gravity and
[1:07:34] it would fall.
[1:07:37] So now everything born under that all of
[1:07:40] us come into the world born in sin
[1:07:42] shaped in iniquity
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; come into the world speaking lies. So we
[1:07:46] start out born in God's mind but when
[1:07:49] we're born we fall
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; and every time we fall what is it? It's
[1:07:55] a law.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; There's no man born perfect.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; There's no man born righteous. There's
[1:08:01] no man born just.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Because whenever you're born, you're
[1:08:04] born here on the mind of God. God was
[1:08:07] eternal, but when you're born, you fall.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; So, there had to be something that was
[1:08:12] greater than the law that would begin to
[1:08:15] as the fall would happen, you would be
[1:08:17] able to be caught by the law.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; It was greater than the law. Right.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; And John says,
[1:08:30] first John, it says, "For the law was
[1:08:32] given by Moses, but grace and truth came
[1:08:35] by Jesus Christ." You see, he was the
[1:08:38] law made flesh. He began to do things
[1:08:40] that that were according to the law. It
[1:08:43] shouldn't be done.
[1:08:46] He began to do things that would defy
[1:08:48] the law.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; To a normal man, how could a man walk on
[1:08:53] water?
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Who is this man?
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Who is this man that could speak to the
[1:08:58] storm and the waves and the seas obeyed
[1:09:00] him?
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; In this time and in this fall, it had to
[1:09:07] be something that would defy the law of
[1:09:09] gravity.
[1:09:13] and God
[1:09:16] would begin to come and the word made
[1:09:18] flesh. Now the law being made flesh and
[1:09:24] in the book of Isaiah, what does it say?
[1:09:26] And Jesus came to the scroll and he
[1:09:28] found where is written of him. What was
[1:09:30] it? It was the law coming to the law.
[1:09:33] And what did the law recognize within
[1:09:35] the scripture? He was no longer the law.
[1:09:38] The law was coming to the law, but he
[1:09:41] was the made flesh. And what did he come
[1:09:43] to realize?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; He was the grace sent to the law.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; He was the grace sent to the law.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Because in Luke 4, he says, "The spirit
[1:09:58] of the Lord is upon me because he hath
[1:10:00] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:10:02] poor. He has sent me to heal the
[1:10:04] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[1:10:06] the captive, the recovering of the sight
[1:10:09] to the blind, to set liberty them that
[1:10:12] are bruised,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; and to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:10:16] Lord. And he closed the book,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; and he went and sat down, and they were
[1:10:20] all confound.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; The law was coming to the written law.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; What was it? He was grace to that law.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; He was mercy.
[1:10:36] He was deliverance. He was healing.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; He was virtue.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; He was everything that we had needed.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; That us as mankind, there's nothing that
[1:10:46] we can do within ourselves to restore us
[1:10:49] back to the original. So God had to send
[1:10:52] his only begotten son that whenever the
[1:10:54] fall would happen, something greater
[1:10:56] than the law that would defy the law of
[1:10:59] gravity would come and catch it in the
[1:11:01] middle and restore it back to the
[1:11:03] original.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; What is this story all about? What is
[1:11:07] the Bible all about? It's about a love
[1:11:09] story about redemption. God bringing his
[1:11:12] people back to the beginning, back to
[1:11:15] the very mind of God.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] back to the very harmony of Almighty
[1:11:21] God.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; God was manifesting outwardly the very
[1:11:32] law that God had put in him
[1:11:36] in the restoration of the bride tree. He
[1:11:38] says God set all his laws to serve him,
[1:11:40] both natural and spiritual, working
[1:11:43] according to his word, regardless of the
[1:11:46] condition. I love that. He says, "I had
[1:11:49] a scripture here on that." Yes. God sets
[1:11:51] all of his laws in motion. Think of it.
[1:11:54] Let it soak in. He said, "God set all of
[1:11:56] his laws in motion that it must work
[1:11:58] according to his own word."
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; He says his word, his laws has to work
[1:12:05] according to his word. He commanded the
[1:12:08] sun. He commanded the moon. He commanded
[1:12:10] the earth. He commanded nature. And they
[1:12:13] all fall right in line.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the laws work in harmony
[1:12:18] with God's spoken word.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; It's not just his word, but it's spoken
[1:12:24] word.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; And the law of life that is in us
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; will bring us to a resurrection.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; It's got to. It's impossible. It's
[1:12:38] impossible, saints, for it not to. God
[1:12:42] has put a law inside of you that it's
[1:12:44] got to bring you to that resurrection.
[1:12:47] It's got to bring you to that
[1:12:48] restoration. How do I know? Because the
[1:12:50] law is inside of me.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And if the law is inside of me and it's
[1:12:54] inside of you, then you will be there.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; How do I know the rapture is going to
[1:13:01] happen? When do I know it's going to
[1:13:03] take place? It don't matter because I
[1:13:05] know that there's a law inside of me
[1:13:07] that whenever it happens, I'm going to
[1:13:09] be going. Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; That's the law I'm depending on.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; It's impossible for it not to.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; You see, right now, you're being
[1:13:27] restored by that which is already in
[1:13:30] you.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; You don't need anything added more to
[1:13:33] you.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; You don't need any more laws and things.
[1:13:35] God had put inside of you a law and that
[1:13:38] law is going to take you to your final
[1:13:40] destination. All you got to do is sit in
[1:13:42] his presence and abide by those laws and
[1:13:45] those guidance and that guidance is the
[1:13:47] Holy Spirit in your life.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; The law within nature, the scripture
[1:14:00] says, is groaning and yearning for what?
[1:14:04] the manifestations
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; of the sons and daughters of God.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; That they are operating in this realm of
[1:14:13] a fallen earth.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; They're just operating yet they're still
[1:14:18] in their cycle under their laws, but
[1:14:20] they are waiting for us to go back
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; to the original, back to the harmony of
[1:14:26] almighty God.
[1:14:29] Brother Brandham says again in the
[1:14:31] restoration of the bride tree,
[1:14:36] he says, you know, a a fish has a law,
[1:14:39] and that fish can stand up here in
[1:14:41] water, and he has a law within him. If
[1:14:45] he'll just let go of that law that's in
[1:14:47] him, he can sink plum to the bottom of
[1:14:49] the sea. Won't bother him a bit, won't
[1:14:52] break one cell. You try to do it. That
[1:14:55] law is not in you. Let me say this. Too
[1:14:58] many times we're trying to do things
[1:15:00] that the law isn't in you.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Why don't you fit in? Why can't you do
[1:15:04] those things out there? Because that law
[1:15:06] of sin and death is not inside of you.
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; That law is not in you.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You can't do it. But that fish can. He
[1:15:20] deflates himself with that air in such a
[1:15:24] way that he can. There's nothing in him
[1:15:26] to burst open. He's made that way. He
[1:15:30] knows it. And he can enforce that law to
[1:15:32] take them plum to the bottom of the sea,
[1:15:34] then raise them back up again.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If a fishing, a little
[1:15:39] fish can identify what law is inside of
[1:15:41] him,
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; if a fish can identify that if I do this
[1:15:44] law that God placed inside of me, how
[1:15:47] much more should sons and daughters of
[1:15:49] the living God be able to identify the
[1:15:51] law that's inside of them?
[1:16:00] How much more he says that there was a
[1:16:02] law in Christ. That law is in men. You
[1:16:06] can bury him in the deepest grave or in
[1:16:08] the deepest sea or the lowest hell.
[1:16:10] There's a law and the spirit of God that
[1:16:13] will raise him up again.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; So it don't matter where you bury me. It
[1:16:18] don't matter where you're at in the
[1:16:20] world. That's why he says, "I have
[1:16:21] called a people from every kindred,
[1:16:23] tongue, and nation." Because it doesn't
[1:16:25] matter where you're at, geographically.
[1:16:27] It don't matter where you're at. If
[1:16:29] there's that law of God, he's going to
[1:16:31] raise you up.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That law has to bring forth.
[1:16:44] He says, "And a bird
[1:16:47] has a law and it's a body and its body
[1:16:50] is material. It's earthbound, sets on
[1:16:53] the earth here, but it has a law within
[1:16:56] it that the way it spreads its wings, it
[1:17:00] can plum fly out of sight." That's
[1:17:02] against science.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; They claim it's earthbound. Gravitation
[1:17:08] has a hold on it here, but it can defy
[1:17:11] gravitation.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Lift itself off up right off of it
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; and right on out because it has to put
[1:17:18] that law that's in it to work.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; It's built to possess that law.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; It's materialistic.
[1:17:31] All these laws are put in place and
[1:17:34] science can say how is that possible
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; that an animal can do all these things
[1:17:40] and it can just get up and fly away.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; What is it doing is defying gravity
[1:17:46] sir?
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; What are you doing this evening?
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; You're a natural creature. You're made
[1:17:52] of the dust of the earth.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; But yet there's something inside of you
[1:17:56] that one day you are going to defy
[1:17:58] gravity. that just as gravity has a pull
[1:18:00] on you and every day you wake up and you
[1:18:03] got to die to this flesh and you got to
[1:18:05] die and you got to die.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Because this gravitational law of
[1:18:10] sin and death is within us. It don't
[1:18:12] matter how rich or or how great you are
[1:18:15] or how well you eat and take care of
[1:18:17] this body, you are going to die. Amen.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; But yet there's a law within you that
[1:18:22] when gravitation begins to take place,
[1:18:25] let me tell you, I hope I'm here when
[1:18:27] the the rapture of the bride comes
[1:18:29] because let me tell you, there's going
[1:18:30] to be ones that when God comes and is
[1:18:34] going to defy all gravitation, all
[1:18:36] natural laws that when law comes and
[1:18:38] tries to hold you, something else is
[1:18:40] going to come and take you out of here.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; You didn't do anything to earn it. You
[1:18:49] didn't do anything to discern them.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; But that law was put in you before the
[1:18:55] foundation of the world. You were
[1:18:56] predestinated with this law inside of
[1:18:59] you.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; That law,
[1:19:15] he puts that law in it to work. He's
[1:19:18] built to possess the law.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this evening, you're
[1:19:22] built to possess the law.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; You're built to defy the laws that Satan
[1:19:27] has against you. Too many times you're
[1:19:29] focusing, as we read in that quote, too
[1:19:31] many times you're focusing on the laws
[1:19:33] of Satan.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Stop being so negative.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Stop looking to the positive.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Start defying all those things.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:48] It's our inheritance to possess the
[1:19:50] land. Sir,
[1:19:54] let me ask you.
[1:19:56] We're talking about animals.
[1:19:59] It came to me, what makes a lion the
[1:20:02] king of the jungle?
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; What makes him? What in him?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Who told him he was the king?
[1:20:15] Who told him?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; He's not the biggest.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; He's not the tallest. He's not the
[1:20:20] fastest.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; He's against all odds.
[1:20:25] But what told him inside him? You are
[1:20:26] the king. And if you've ever heard a
[1:20:28] lion roar, let me tell you, everybody
[1:20:31] listens. It gets your attraction. We
[1:20:34] were at the zoo the other day and it
[1:20:36] began to just puff out.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; You can hear that thing all the way
[1:20:42] across. It's true.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; All the way across sends chills down
[1:20:46] your back. But who told him?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; There's a law inside him.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; There's a law that God put inside of him
[1:20:54] that said, "You're the king.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; You're the one that rules.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; He's put that law inside of you.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; He's put that law inside of you.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; You might not be the biggest.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; You might not be the fastest.
[1:21:13] You might not be able to sing. You might
[1:21:15] not be able to do nothing.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; But God has put a law inside of you.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; He has put a law inside of you. Why?
[1:21:23] Because he loves you
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; and he chose you and he called you.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; It's not my choosing. It's not your
[1:21:29] choosing. But God chose you.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] Let me finish this quote. He says now,
[1:21:44] he says, "Now I'm feeling be uh feel
[1:21:46] religious."
[1:21:48] He says, "Now we have a law. The law of
[1:21:50] life is in us." He says, "Only thing you
[1:21:52] have to do, you were made and born and
[1:21:55] placed here in the body of Christ as
[1:21:58] sons and daughters of God."
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You were made, born and placed.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; So, what did you have to do with it?
[1:22:06] Right.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You don't have to knuckle down to the
[1:22:11] devil. We've got a law and that's the
[1:22:14] law of the Holy Spirit. The only thing
[1:22:16] you have to do is to know how to let go
[1:22:19] and let God. Let go and let God. Let go
[1:22:23] and let God. But yet, that's the hardest
[1:22:25] thing is to let go and let God have his
[1:22:28] sovereign way.
[1:22:38] He says, "You keep fighting at it and it
[1:22:41] won't never seem to work when you let go
[1:22:43] and let God." That's all
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; is to know that the law of life is in
[1:22:48] you.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; You just have to let go and let God.
[1:22:51] Then he takes your healing. He takes you
[1:22:54] to the baptism of the spirit or anything
[1:22:57] else that's he's promised. any claim
[1:22:59] that he's given is yours by letting go
[1:23:02] and letting God. You say, "Brother
[1:23:04] James, I don't know how my son and
[1:23:05] daughters are going to be saved. I don't
[1:23:07] know how loved ones are going to come
[1:23:08] in." I don't know either. But I know
[1:23:10] that if we learn to let go and let God
[1:23:13] have his way. His ways are above our
[1:23:15] ways. His thoughts are above our
[1:23:17] thoughts.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; He's going to work it out.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, he will.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Just let go and let God.
[1:23:30] Sometimes it seems too easy to let go
[1:23:32] and just let God. We try to control it.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; We try to figure it out.
[1:23:38] But let the law that is in you. Listen.
[1:23:40] Let the law that is in you pull you into
[1:23:42] that manifestation.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Let the law of the rapture, let the law
[1:23:49] of all the promises pull you into those
[1:23:52] promises.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] It's the law of the Holy Spirit inside
[1:24:01] you that's doing the work.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Musicians come
[1:24:09] again. He says, "But the law of the
[1:24:10] spirit of God is to force Satan to give
[1:24:15] up that he unrightly deceitfully taken
[1:24:19] from God." Souls of men he took from
[1:24:22] God. souls of women, children, sickness
[1:24:24] of the body, he placed upon the people
[1:24:29] where God made them in his image to be
[1:24:32] like him. And the church is given the
[1:24:35] rightful legal right by the Bible to
[1:24:37] take the Holy Spirit and force this upon
[1:24:40] him.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; It's a law inside of you. Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in Romans 8:2, he
[1:24:50] says, "For the law of the spirit of life
[1:24:53] is Christ Jesus and has made me free
[1:24:55] from the law of sin and death. For what
[1:24:58] the law could not do, that is was weak
[1:25:01] through the flesh.
[1:25:03] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:25:05] of a sinful flesh and for sin condemns
[1:25:09] sin in the flesh.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; That the righteousness of the law might
[1:25:14] be fulfilled in who?
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; That the righteousness of God of the law
[1:25:19] might be fulfilled in you.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Who walk not after the flesh
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; but after
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; the spirit. Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; When you begin to walk after the spirit,
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; you see, we're getting into uncertain
[1:25:39] times,
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; dark times.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; It proves today that men will give their
[1:25:49] life
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; for what they believe.
[1:25:58] the persecution of Christians.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; If you don't think it's here,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Satan is going to enforce his laws so
[1:26:12] much.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; He's going to make it hard.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; He's going to try to take rights away
[1:26:18] and things away.
[1:26:24] But don't worry
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; because there's a law.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; That's greater than anything that he can
[1:26:31] send our way.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; We don't have anything to do with it.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; But let go
[1:26:41] and let God
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; have his way.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:27:02] I have this scripture James 2 and8.
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; If ye fulfill the royal law according to
[1:27:11] the scripture,
[1:27:13] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,
[1:27:16] ye do well.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] But if ye have respects a person, you
[1:27:21] commit sin and are condemned of the law
[1:27:23] as transgressors. For whosoever shall
[1:27:26] keep the whole law, yet offend in one
[1:27:30] point, he is guilty of them all.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; The royal law.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Galatians says, "Bury one another
[1:27:37] burdens."
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; And so fulfill
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; the law of Christ.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's Christianity, saints.
[1:27:48] Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; I don't got to tell you these things
[1:27:51] because the law inside of you will do
[1:27:54] those things.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Did you catch that?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; That the law inside of you
[1:28:04] will love your brother.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; He'll bear one another's burdens.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; He'll help a brother in need. He'll
[1:28:11] encourage a brother. He'll uplift a
[1:28:14] brother.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say, Lord, help us to do better.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Help us to be ones that we're not afraid
[1:28:24] to reach out and
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; to ask a brother how he's doing.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:30] That's right.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Do the royal law of God.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Love thy neighbor as thyself.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song.
[1:28:46] it all in control.
[1:28:53] He's got it all in control.
[1:29:01] He's put that reassur
[1:29:06] way down in my soul.
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:12] He's got it all in control.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; My father knows what I need.
[1:29:21] My father knows what I need.
[1:29:29] My father knows what I need.
[1:29:37] And everything I go through, he knows
[1:29:42] what's best for me.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; My father knows what I put my life in
[1:29:52] his hands.
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; I put my life in his hand.
[1:30:05] I've put my life in his hands.
[1:30:12] So every road I walk down, I'm sure it's
[1:30:18] in his plans.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; I've put my life in control.
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:32] He's got it all in control.
[1:30:37] [Applause]
[1:30:40] He's got it all in control.
[1:30:48] He's put that reassur
[1:30:52] way down in my soul.
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:00] He's got it all.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, how grateful and thankful we are,
[1:31:10] Lord, for another opportunity,
[1:31:15] Lord. Your word is true,
[1:31:21] Lord. It's not based upon what we can do
[1:31:24] within ourselves, oh God.
[1:31:28] [Music]

[1:31:40] world.

[1:31:44] earth and it seems like
[1:31:47] there's no light,
[1:31:50] but Father, you're guiding us. You're
[1:31:54] watching over us. You're protecting us,
[1:31:56] oh God. Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; And as long as we have the law within
[1:32:00] us, you're going to bring us
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; to the resurrection.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; You're going to re bring us to that
[1:32:05] rapture.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we are a part of you.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Father, we're so thankful that you chose
[1:32:15] us,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; that you called us.
[1:32:19] And now, Father, as we go our separate
[1:32:21] ways, I I pray a special blessing upon
[1:32:23] your people. Father, that you would
[1:32:26] bless them, that you would uplift them,
[1:32:29] that you would encourage them. Lord, I
[1:32:31] know they're going through trials and
[1:32:32] they have sicknesses within their body.
[1:32:34] But Father, we don't have to accept
[1:32:36] those laws and those things that
[1:32:38] sicknesses and cancer that Satan tries
[1:32:41] to throw at us, oh God.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; But let us take the law of faith.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; And take you at your word, oh God.

[1:32:52] hands. bless your people

[1:33:06] precious name.
