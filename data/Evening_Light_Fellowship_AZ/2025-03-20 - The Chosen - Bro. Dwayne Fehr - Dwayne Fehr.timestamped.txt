[31:33] run
[31:35] away I know my son-in-law is out there
[31:37] you all know I'm just simple so 44 is
[31:40] not hard to take care of is it garve
[31:42] don't do
[31:43] that they used to you know I have to say
[31:47] this
[31:48] just you know the there there's uh we
[31:52] start young and then we grow and as we
[31:55] grow uh things change in our lives and
[31:57] our hearts change and our desires change
[32:00] and you know when you're I was young
[32:03] once and I heard brother brother Ron
[32:06] talking about you know those guys that
[32:07] go down the street and you know their
[32:09] five cars back and you can feel the boom
[32:11] boom and you're you're thinking what's
[32:12] wrong with my car
[32:13] and but I was once that guy and uh and
[32:18] you know we
[32:19] were I I would come to my mom's place
[32:23] where we go for the weekend and I'd get
[32:26] up Sunday morning and she 'd have
[32:28] instrumental music playing and I would
[32:29] think oh my word
[32:31] mother are you for real and I would
[32:34] tease her I'm like Mom like don't you
[32:36] have something that's got some life in
[32:38] it and and you know and then eventually
[32:41] I found myself um got to the place where
[32:44] I didn't
[32:45] like I mean it's not that I don't like
[32:47] it but there has to be a time for it and
[32:49] and you know and then I would find
[32:52] myself get in the car and I didn't want
[32:54] to hear anybody's voice I just wanted to
[32:55] hear instrumental music and you you know
[32:57] I'm getting to be an old man I I get
[33:00] into my son-in-law used to just give me
[33:02] the hardest time about you know
[33:04] those those old songs and the way we
[33:07] sing them and you realize that he's
[33:09] starting to play and sing a whole lot
[33:11] like
[33:11] that I got into his house the other day
[33:14] and here's my daughter and she's got
[33:17] instrumental music playing and I
[33:20] thought brother are we getting old or
[33:22] are they getting
[33:25] old you know I'm thankful for the stage
[33:27] of life I'm thankful for every stage of
[33:31] life I was I can say this I was young
[33:33] once and I enjoyed it and now I'm old
[33:37] not as old as some but I am old and I'm
[33:40] enjoying it uh you know you think well
[33:44] I'm here I'm a grandpa already and I
[33:45] think but I wouldn't want to go
[33:48] back I wouldn't want to go back I'm
[33:51] happy to be in this stage of life and so
[33:55] anyhow it's good to be here I certainly
[33:57] do appreciate
[33:58] brother Ron opening his Pulpit I didn't
[34:01] come for that I I came to visit my
[34:03] family um but it's always an honor
[34:06] brother Ron always an honor um I'll just
[34:11] say I'm one of those young men that
[34:13] looks to that
[34:14] generation and brother Ron has just been
[34:17] one of those Epistles that um that you
[34:20] can follow that you can look to and you
[34:23] can say you know
[34:25] what that's the road I want to go thank
[34:27] you Lord just like
[34:29] that so God bless
[34:35] [Music]
[34:51] you one dark night in Egypt
[34:58] a
[34:59] fearful time had
[35:04] come for one little
[35:08] Hebrew boy who was his father's
[35:15] firstborn
[35:17] son with the angel of
[35:21] death passing by it was hard to fall
[35:27] fall
[35:31] asleep but one little lamb stood in his
[35:37] mind as he laid there count and
[35:43] Sh he wondered why the young lamb had to
[35:50] die why his blood was on the door

[40:06] take the opportunity to thank you uh for
[40:09] keeping little baby Kai in prayer amen
[40:12] uh you know many times we we have the
[40:15] privilege to pray with people and for
[40:17] people and uh you know sometimes you can
[40:21] enter right in and the next time you
[40:24] just do it because you've been asked to
[40:25] do it and we know God answers prayer
[40:28] anyhow but when it hits your home that's
[40:32] when it's part of your family when it's
[40:34] part of the blood stream that you
[40:37] hold all of a sudden something else try
[40:39] takes place I'm so thankful I had calls

[41:49] they're red you've not chosen me but I
[41:54] have chosen you ordained you that you
[41:56] should go go and bring forth fruit that
[41:59] your fruit should remain that where
[42:02] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[42:04] in my name he may give it to you amen
[42:08] and if you got your Bibles turn back to
[42:10] the Book of Joshua I hope brother John I
[42:11] hope brother Ron you don't mind but uh
[42:14] we've been in this thought since the
[42:15] beginning of the year and uh I just love
[42:18] to see how the Holy Spirit works and so
[42:20] I'm just going to drop in tonight this
[42:22] is a familiar scripture to us and I
[42:24] believe it's just uh it's eminent for
[42:26] the hour we're living in right now I
[42:29] have not come Joshua chapter 1 Joshua
[42:32] chapter 1 verse 9 have not I commanded
[42:36] thee be strong and of a good
[42:41] courage let me let me read that again I
[42:44] did you did you all hear that okay now I
[42:48] want you to look at the author the one
[42:49] that wrote it I'll just be the most
[42:51] piece tonight have not I commanded thee
[42:54] I'm not asking for an opinion I'm not
[42:56] asking for what you think have not I
[42:59] commanded thee be strong and of a good
[43:03] courage and Be not Afraid yeah neither
[43:08] NE neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[43:10] thy God is with thee hallah for the Lord
[43:14] thy God is with
[43:17] thee
[43:18] wheresoever thou goest let's bow our
[43:21] heads one more time father thank you for
[43:24] your word tonight Lord we know your word
[43:26] is life and if you just come now and
[43:28] Quicken it father we'll just be so
[43:30] appreciative we ask these things in
[43:32] Jesus name amen God bless you you can
[43:35] have your seats again this evening I'll
[43:37] take a little been on a little thought
[43:40] at home and um it's uh I kind of stole
[43:45] it from I I can't you know we have to be
[43:47] honest sometimes and I I'm not one that
[43:49] does a whole lot of watching of videos
[43:52] and movies and all that but I hear some
[43:54] of the young people talk sometime and
[43:55] they ask me hey brother Dwayne have you
[43:56] ever watch The Chosen and I'm like well
[43:59] maybe one episode maybe two in all the
[44:01] years that it's been playing or whatever
[44:03] I I haven't seen too many of them I'm
[44:04] not against it probably it's very
[44:06] good but it was the title amen that
[44:10] caught my attention The
[44:13] Chosen because God has a
[44:16] choosing listen when Jesus walked the
[44:18] face of the Earth it was him that chose
[44:21] the disciples that he chose it's always
[44:23] been God's choosing it's not man's
[44:25] choosing it's always been God's choosing
[44:27] and and and so uh my thought is this the
[44:31] Chosen and if we were to look at the
[44:33] scriptures you know we would find the
[44:35] scripture says that you have I you have
[44:37] not chosen him but he has chosen you he
[44:41] has chosen you and ordained you now this
[44:44] church when God makes a choice Len God
[44:46] is not a haphazard God God is not
[44:49] somebody who just you know puts his hand
[44:50] in the Hat and pulls out and says well
[44:51] that should be good enough oh no if God
[44:53] makes a choice it's the right choice if
[44:57] God makes a choice there's a purpose in
[44:58] it there's a reality to it and God's
[45:01] choices are never the wrong choice and
[45:04] so when he said I have chosen you I've
[45:06] ordained you to go that you that you
[45:09] would go and bring forth fruit and so I
[45:11] I've taken my little thought from the
[45:12] beginning of the year at home has been
[45:14] be strong and very courageous because
[45:18] although you might be God's choice his
[45:20] ways are not your ways and the reality
[45:23] that he wants out of your life not might
[45:25] not be the reality that you and I want
[45:27] out of our lives and he knows the path
[45:30] that we must trod to bring the very best
[45:33] to bring the very best listen he's the
[45:35] one that made you everything that is
[45:38] about you everything that there's good
[45:40] about you God put it in you when before
[45:42] you were even born the time that you
[45:44] come to Earth everything good that God
[45:47] wanted out of your life was already in
[45:49] you then but it takes a process to get
[45:52] it out you know I think the gems the the
[45:55] the the value of some of the the D
[45:57] diamonds and the rubies and and and all
[45:59] the valuable rocks the ones that you
[46:02] guys would pay you know tens and
[46:04] thousands and hundreds of thousands of
[46:05] dollars for how are they made they're
[46:09] not laying on the surface they're made
[46:12] under great pressure that's what makes
[46:14] them valuable the crushing and
[46:17] everything that goes on that's what
[46:19] makes them valuable I think oh god
[46:23] listen that's what makes you and I
[46:24] valuable to too and so I just take a
[46:27] little thought tonight if I could just
[46:29] get started I was uh I was back at home
[46:32] and and uh you know thinking on the
[46:35] things of the Lord and I opened up my my
[46:38] Bible to the book of Nehemiah and
[46:40] something just shook me and I began to
[46:42] read and it hasn't left me since uh
[46:44] since the beginning of the year so I'm
[46:46] going to you know how this the spirit of
[46:48] the Lord works I'm just going to move
[46:49] right into it and and if you got your
[46:51] Bibles and you want to just turn over
[46:53] the book of Nehemiah the first chapter
[46:55] tonight you'll find that right by
[46:57] behind
[46:58] Ezra the book of
[47:01] Nehemiah chapter one and I I want to I
[47:04] want to read it this way it says the
[47:05] words of Nehemiah the son of ah boy I'm
[47:09] I'm hard at these things
[47:12] aalo um thank you thank you that's what
[47:15] I call Body Ministry thank you and it
[47:17] came to pass in the month of chisu in
[47:19] the 20th year as I was in shushan the
[47:22] palace that Han haniah one of my
[47:24] brethren came and certain men of Judah
[47:26] and I asked them concerning the Jews
[47:29] that had escaped which were left of the
[47:31] Captivity and concerning Jerusalem and
[47:34] they said unto me the remnant that are
[47:38] left of the Captivity there in the
[47:40] province are in great Affliction and
[47:43] reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is
[47:46] broken down and the gates thereof are
[47:48] burned with fire and it came to pass
[47:52] when I heard these words I sat down and
[47:55] wept and and mourned certain days and
[47:59] fasted and prayed before the god of
[48:02] Heaven I just want I I just want us to
[48:05] catch the picture
[48:08] tonight I read
[48:11] this and something came to my
[48:14] heart what hour are we living in church
[48:17] yeah we're living at the End Amen we're
[48:21] living at the end what
[48:23] age I'm talking about the age what age
[48:26] are we living in not the one we've been
[48:27] caught up into what age are we living in
[48:31] lady OFA we're living in lady OFA an age
[48:34] that the scripture said uh you know God
[48:37] would find himself on the outside
[48:40] knocking trying to get back in
[48:43] amen it said it would be it would be an
[48:45] age that would be rich increased with
[48:48] goods and had need of
[48:52] nothing and here we have Nehemiah you
[48:55] know Nehemiah a man of God and he's he
[48:57] he's been in a place of bondage God I
[49:00] just say it this way there's nothing
[49:01] brother R says this there is nothing out
[49:04] of place in a believer's life you can
[49:07] never be out of the will of God we might
[49:10] get out of the perfect will into his
[49:11] permissive will but he will always bring
[49:14] us back and that permissive will will
[49:16] work out for his perfect will and here
[49:19] we have Nehemiah you know he's he's been
[49:21] in bondage as a as a servant as it were
[49:24] all these years but his heart he's
[49:27] listen Nehemiah is a Son of God we take
[49:29] the Old Testament we type it with the
[49:31] New Testament and Nehemiah being a Son
[49:33] of God he's his heart his whole desire
[49:36] back with his people back in his country
[49:39] he's had these questions and now a
[49:41] message comes a messenger finally comes
[49:44] and Nehemiah asks the question hey what
[49:47] is going on at home how are the people
[49:49] of God how how are they fairing back at
[49:51] home and the report comes back the
[49:54] people of God are downtrodden the walls
[49:57] of the city are knocked down the gates
[49:59] are burned they're they're in a bad
[50:01] position and it made me to think this
[50:03] way you know here's here we
[50:05] are is this not the same situation that
[50:09] the age that we're living in found
[50:11] themselves in that literally the people
[50:14] of God were living I I call it this in
[50:16] an altered reality they weren't living
[50:19] the where God wanted them to live they
[50:20] weren't in the position God wanted them
[50:22] in they were living in a in an altered
[50:25] reality and the STIs part about the read
[50:27] when I begin to read this the saddest
[50:29] part to me was this that the children of
[50:32] God had found them themselves in that
[50:35] condition and it had become
[50:39] normal
[50:40] normal wandering
[50:42] around you know burdened down and and
[50:45] the pressures of life and and the Very
[50:48] walls that should have been their
[50:49] protection knock down and they just they
[50:52] just walk by and just let it be on you
[50:55] think God what's wrong with
[50:58] people but I'll say this it will only be
[51:01] that way as long as God will let it be
[51:04] that way the Bible says there's times
[51:07] and seasons for everything and here's
[51:09] God's children you know they're in a
[51:11] they're in a situation that we we can
[51:14] Absolut absolutely look at these
[51:15] scriptures and we find Insight in them I
[51:18] find Insight in them there's a reality
[51:20] here that that that God's ways are not
[51:23] our ways but God's timing is perfect
[51:26] and When God says it's time for
[51:28] something to happen it don't matter what
[51:31] you think it don't matter what you think
[51:33] or how you try to to change it or to
[51:36] avoid it it will happen just the way God
[51:39] desires for it to happen and so we we we
[51:42] we want to be aware of something tonight
[51:44] that that God has never changed his way
[51:47] since time began God always redeems Man
[51:51] by
[51:52] man can I say that again sir God always
[51:55] redeems man through
[51:58] man we're here tonight because of the
[52:00] man Christ Jesus who was more than just
[52:04] a man but he come to walk in our stead
[52:07] man he God became man to redeem man and
[52:11] where many of you sitting here tonight
[52:13] are are the are the uh the
[52:17] expression of of the preaching of the
[52:19] word the heart of a man of God that has
[52:22] stood here somebody reached out to you
[52:24] somebody uh somebody got your attention
[52:26] attention gave you a word somebody
[52:28] witnessed to you and some or lived a
[52:30] life in front of you and it was your
[52:32] life that Drew them to the
[52:35] light God always redeems man through man
[52:39] and so we're sitting here you know God's
[52:41] ways are are absolutely wonderful we
[52:44] look at you know sometimes we look in
[52:45] the scriptures and we find them we think
[52:47] oh man that's so confusing and I don't
[52:50] understand it and you know we used to
[52:51] sing a little song about the wheel
[52:52] that's in the middle of the wheel and
[52:55] and and I think Lord what is that all
[52:56] about but we realize it's not that
[52:59] mysterious it's simply the mind of God
[53:01] the spirit of God what he's doing in the
[53:04] middle of the wheel those little spokes
[53:06] are running and the will of God is being
[53:08] worked out on Earth it's rolling on
[53:11] Earth down through time and the will of
[53:13] God is being worked out uh in that big
[53:17] wheel it's the wheel of God and so we're
[53:20] thankful for that you know we have when
[53:22] I say that the wheel of God keeps moving
[53:24] according to the time of God
[53:27] according to the time of God and you
[53:29] know brother brand would liken uh you
[53:30] know the time of God to our like we are
[53:33] like to a watch and how that every
[53:35] little piece had to be in the right
[53:38] position so it would keep the right time
[53:41] I'm saying that because I'm getting
[53:42] somewhere tonight because we're a
[53:45] body we're a body and God needs you to
[53:49] be in your
[53:50] place so that when the next clog comes
[53:54] by it catches you just at the right time
[53:56] time and God can use you this is you
[54:00] know Church we're we're I want say this
[54:02] we're a long ways from a one-man
[54:03] Ministry
[54:04] anymore we're a long ways from a one-man
[54:07] Ministry I know people don't like to
[54:08] hear that but it's a reality all that
[54:12] Christ was all that God was he poured
[54:14] into Christ all that Christ was he
[54:16] poured into the
[54:19] church what is it a many membered body
[54:22] God's working through
[54:24] Hallelujah all right
[54:26] Thessalonians says this but of the times
[54:29] and Seasons bre you have no need that I
[54:31] write unto you for you yourselves know
[54:33] perfectly that the day of the Lord
[54:35] cometh as a thief in the night is that
[54:38] true there's times and seasons for
[54:41] everything there's times and seasons for
[54:43] everything and we find that in the book
[54:45] of Nehemiah we find these people living
[54:47] in a condition that is so
[54:50] troubling I don't you know God God when
[54:54] God listen when God created Adam in the
[54:56] beginning
[54:56] did he not create Adam in a perfect in a
[54:58] perfect condition did he not actually
[55:01] make Adam god of the earth amen
[55:05] absolutely he made Adam god of the earth
[55:07] what was God's purpose when he created
[55:09] man in his own image he would make you
[55:12] and brother Ron touched on it Kings and
[55:14] Priests that would be Kings to rule and
[55:17] Reign Over there's got to be a Dominion
[55:20] God gave you a spiritual Dominion to
[55:22] Reign over top of principalities and
[55:24] powers and and the spirits of of
[55:26] darkness and evil God made you a king to
[55:29] rule over those things he made you a
[55:31] priest to intercede for one another and
[55:33] stand in the Gap God made you to be
[55:36] those things and that's what Adam was in
[55:38] the beginning he was all that God was it
[55:41] was poured into a man there he stood
[55:43] just in the likeness of God and
[55:45] absolutely ruling and reigning on the
[55:47] earth and then sin came in totally
[55:51] destroyed the picture and and it's been
[55:53] God's purpose to bring men from where
[55:56] fell from back
[55:58] to can we say Amen to that the condition
[56:02] they fell from back to so I you know we
[56:05] find in the in the book of nemiah you
[56:07] got to you're going to have to bear with
[56:09] me tonight you it's hard when you've had
[56:11] you know months of putting you know just
[56:13] keeps going and going and just going to
[56:15] try and push it all into a little spot
[56:17] tonight but but but we find people
[56:19] living with a victim type of
[56:21] mentality I can't and know I you know
[56:24] the doctor told me the the reports says
[56:26] that I've got you know I've got 101 days
[56:29] to live and and if I do live I'm going
[56:31] to be this and and if I you know the
[56:33] doctor now tells me I've got diabetes
[56:34] and if I and if it keeps going I'm going
[56:37] to lose my leg and I'm going to lose
[56:38] this listen whose report are you going
[56:40] to believe tonight whose report are you
[56:43] going to believe tonight listen you can
[56:45] walk around well you know it runs in the
[56:47] family it ran in the family until you
[56:50] said that's enough until you said that's
[56:53] enough listen God has already there has
[56:55] been blood that's been shed stries have
[56:58] been born and the healing the healing
[57:00] virtues already been sent forth and it's
[57:02] yours if you'll stand on it the thing is
[57:05] Satan is going to Buffet you day and
[57:08] night day and night day and night until
[57:11] he can wear you out and you'll finally
[57:13] say well I guess that's the way it
[57:15] is here's God's children living in a
[57:18] condition where their homes are broken
[57:20] and and everything that they that they
[57:23] sought they believed and they you know
[57:24] where's this God that we believe where
[57:26] is he at I'll tell you something he's
[57:29] alive and he's here tonight he's alive
[57:33] and he's here tonight he's not just the
[57:35] god of yesterday and he's not just the
[57:37] god of tomorrow he is here and he's now
[57:40] in he's we're in his presence even now
[57:43] Hallelujah you know I I got a little
[57:45] grandson back home and I uh I'm just
[57:47] having the time of my life with these
[57:49] little children you know and and and we
[57:51] had them all over at Christmas time and
[57:53] he wanted to go do something outside and
[57:56] and you know I kept telling him you know
[57:57] I said hey Henry I said just you know
[57:59] Grandpa's talking right now and he come
[58:01] back and Grandpa can we go out and and
[58:03] and finally I said Henry I said you know
[58:04] I looked at my watch I said Henry when
[58:06] the big hand gets to the top I said
[58:08] we'll go out man we talked and talked
[58:11] and all of a sudden he came running into
[58:14] the living room and he said Grandpa the
[58:16] big hands at the top he's four years old
[58:19] he doesn't even know what it means but
[58:21] he knows that when the big hand reaches
[58:22] the top something's going to change and
[58:25] in our lives Church there comes a time
[58:27] when the time clock of God keeps ticking
[58:30] and when the big hand reaches where it's
[58:31] supposed to be something's got to change
[58:34] in our lives it can't remain the same
[58:37] and and so we find that God's people
[58:40] God's people have always been in a
[58:42] condition God allows the you know he
[58:43] allows us the the mountain tops and he
[58:45] allows the valleys and he allows the sun
[58:48] and the snow and and there's life and
[58:50] there's death there's always this you
[58:52] know the contrast God and he's
[58:55] expressing himself in the contrast how
[58:57] can you enjoy good health if you never
[58:59] get sick how can you enjoy uh you know
[59:03] happiness and joy if you've never been
[59:05] uh downtrod and you've never had burdens
[59:07] and weights on your shoulders and
[59:09] finally something breaks and you're free
[59:11] and oh it feels so good and we can
[59:13] rejoice in that but how much more does
[59:16] God love it when things are down and
[59:18] when you're when it looks like there's
[59:20] nothing good and everything looks wrong
[59:22] and you can still lift up your hands and
[59:24] say but I know My Redeemer Lives listen
[59:29] he's not God of our feelings tonight
[59:31] he's a god of his word hallelujah
[59:35] hallelujah you know I think sometimes of

[1:00:09] was all you know everything was going
[1:00:11] good for him no he was still seed listen
[1:00:14] did it mean that God didn't love him no
[1:00:16] it didn't mean that God didn't love him
[1:00:18] did it mean God was you know God had his
[1:00:20] whip out no it didn't mean that it did

[1:00:41] of the glory that he that he once had
[1:00:44] and was it hard for him go read the book

[1:01:13] could just find where he's at but
[1:01:15] there's times where God doesn't want you
[1:01:17] to do that he's got something for you in
[1:01:20] the valley of decision in the valley of
[1:01:23] hurt and pain he's got something that

[1:08:20] living in an hour brother talking about
[1:08:22] the revelation of God you realize that
[1:08:23] the revelation of God could not come
[1:08:26] till the lamb took his
[1:08:28] book come on brother it's the truth is
[1:08:31] that the truth Revelations chapter 5 he
[1:08:34] takes the book right Revelations chapter
[1:08:37] 6 The Seals begin to break
[1:08:40] yep yeah first the
[1:08:43] Redeemer first the

[1:08:56] let me just move on
[1:08:59] here
[1:09:02] okay I'm not going to get into this
[1:09:04] tonight but you know if you go to
[1:09:05] Revelations chapter 6 and you begin to
[1:09:07] read the breaking of the seals you find
[1:09:09] out one thing that every time that a
[1:09:12] seal
[1:09:13] breaks what
[1:09:15] happens
[1:09:17] war
[1:09:20] war seal breaks
[1:09:24] War seal it's a new revelation God
[1:09:26] begins to express something else begins
[1:09:28] to unfold something else another part of
[1:09:30] his being his deity every time that a SE
[1:09:33] would break War breaks out all right
[1:09:36] sometimes we just look at the scriptures
[1:09:37] and we're like well that's for the
[1:09:38] church ages and but I don't know if we
[1:09:41] do we understand tonight that that God
[1:09:43] is no longer dealing in the church ages
[1:09:47] correct what do I shame on me forgive me
[1:09:49] for that statement I know you understand
[1:09:51] that because I know what your pastor
[1:09:52] preaches amen you absolutely understand
[1:09:55] that
[1:09:55] right forgive me for
[1:09:58] that God is no longer dealing with the
[1:10:01] church ages it's done it's over yep it's
[1:10:05] done it's over go back and read the we
[1:10:07] we get back into the Book of Revelations
[1:10:08] you find out you know Revelations 1 2 3
[1:10:11] there God's dealing Revelation chapter 3
[1:10:13] God's dealing through the church ages we
[1:10:15] see joh John writing out the church ages
[1:10:17] to the Ephesian age to the uh sman age
[1:10:19] to the perian age and on and on it goes
[1:10:21] to the lady oan age and then we find
[1:10:24] what
[1:10:26] right yeah he's on the outside right
[1:10:28] that's right but go to Revelations 41
[1:10:31] and what do you get yes sir and he's
[1:10:33] being told John's being told come up
[1:10:35] hither he's no longer down in the church
[1:10:38] age he's calling to somebody to come up
[1:10:41] higher oh Church come up higher tonight
[1:10:45] rise and Rise into the presence of God
[1:10:47] God's calling us to a higher plane he's
[1:10:50] not calling for us to be bound down and
[1:10:52] Shackled down and and run away with you
[1:10:55] know that just directing Our Lives he's
[1:10:57] calling you come up into my presence I
[1:11:00] got things I want to show you I got
[1:11:02] things I want to tell you I want to
[1:11:04] express to you who you really are
[1:11:08] hallelujah hallelujah so so when I say
[1:11:11] these things that every time we we can
[1:11:13] look at the principle that every time
[1:11:14] that a seal is broke War breaks out let
[1:11:17] me just reflect this brother Brown says
[1:11:18] this in the church H book he says notice
[1:11:20] what happens here it's the plan the
[1:11:22] first thing happens announcement in
[1:11:24] heaven
[1:11:26] what happens a seal is opened what is
[1:11:29] that a mystery is unfolded see and when
[1:11:33] the mystery unfolds then a trumpet
[1:11:36] sounds and does what declares war
[1:11:40] declares
[1:11:41] war it declares war a plague Falls and
[1:11:44] the church ages open what is the war
[1:11:46] part what is the war part the angel of
[1:11:50] the church catches the mystery of God
[1:11:52] not fully revealed but when he does he
[1:11:55] catches the mystery of God then he goes
[1:11:57] forth to the people after the mystery
[1:12:00] has been given to him Goes Forth to the
[1:12:02] people and what does uh uh what does he
[1:12:05] do out there he begins to Proclaim that
[1:12:08] message that's right what does it start
[1:12:11] a war a spiritual
[1:12:14] war all right now we can recognize that
[1:12:18] in the church
[1:12:19] ages we can recognize that in the church
[1:12:22] ages that when God begins to R feels
[1:12:25] something when he wants to take the
[1:12:28] church to another level spiritual war
[1:12:31] breaks out every time we can go back
[1:12:33] through it all every time but
[1:12:38] listen those Church
[1:12:40] ages we can look at them and if you if
[1:12:44] we could just recognize that God what
[1:12:46] God did in the church ages he's actually
[1:12:47] doing in our lives also he's actually
[1:12:51] doing in our lives also this is not just
[1:12:53] something that's sitting out there in
[1:12:54] the ages but you know we are being let
[1:12:56] me just use this for an illustration
[1:12:57] tonight this morning or this morning
[1:12:59] Sunday morning we had my little grandson
[1:13:01] up here correct am little baby brother
[1:13:05] Ron you looked on his face you held him
[1:13:08] you watched this little life move but
[1:13:10] prior to
[1:13:11] that prior to that there was nine
[1:13:15] months there was nine
[1:13:18] months that he was absolutely concealed
[1:13:21] you didn't know if it was going to be a
[1:13:22] boy you didn't know if it was going to
[1:13:23] be a girl you didn't know if he was
[1:13:24] going to have black hair red hair white
[1:13:26] hair you didn't know what he was going
[1:13:27] to have you didn't know what he's so
[1:13:29] it's not and then when the when the when
[1:13:31] the Revelation is made known oh it's a
[1:13:33] boy and he's got you know brown hair and
[1:13:35] blue eyes and and oh my but that's not
[1:13:39] the end right that's not the end that
[1:13:42] little baby in a little bit of time he
[1:13:44] begins to express right now he's sitting
[1:13:46] there cries for what he wants fills his
[1:13:48] pants you know just whatever he needs to
[1:13:50] do to get his mom's attention and then
[1:13:53] in a few short you know maybe three or
[1:13:54] four years now the
[1:13:57] nature of what God has made that little
[1:13:59] creature to be now it starts expressing
[1:14:02] itself but he's not going to stay a
[1:14:04] little six-year-old boy or four-year-old
[1:14:06] boy that's not what God made him for God
[1:14:08] made him to mature to come to maturity
[1:14:11] that's right and so it'll be another you
[1:14:13] know he'll go to school and all of a
[1:14:15] sudden you still what's he going to do
[1:14:16] in life I don't know he's four years old
[1:14:18] he's six years old what's he going to
[1:14:19] you tell me but God there's a revelation
[1:14:22] that will be made known if you'll just
[1:14:23] give it time amen but every time that
[1:14:26] there's a change there's a war every
[1:14:29] time there's a change there's a war you
[1:14:32] take a young man a young girl you know
[1:14:33] 11 years old 10 years old and in a few
[1:14:36] short years they've got to they've got
[1:14:37] to become uh men and women I'll tell you
[1:14:39] what that little that little ages gets
[1:14:41] to be so hard the the turmoil that's
[1:14:43] going in on in their body and and their
[1:14:45] actions and reactions and brother Brown
[1:14:47] says you just be patient with them then
[1:14:49] be patient they'll come through it why
[1:14:51] because God is going to express more of
[1:14:54] what he wants want out of their life
[1:14:56] amen hallelujah all
[1:14:59] right let me let me just go on here just
[1:15:01] a little

[1:25:38] to say our generation but in our
[1:25:39] generation in this
[1:25:41] age God sent a prophet to visit this
[1:25:43] world and God you brother said he said
[1:25:45] he had more success in my Ministry than
[1:25:48] he did in his own
[1:25:49] Ministry and much the world knows about
[1:25:51] it
[1:25:54] yeah so humble so
[1:26:01] humble listen the only
[1:26:04] way that we're going to find what the
[1:26:06] purpose of God is in our lives is to get

[1:26:12] the presence of God Amen when you get
[1:26:15] into the presence of God something
[1:26:16] happens yes always where God is
[1:26:20] something happens always lives get
[1:26:23] changed
[1:26:25] you know I was reminded of that the
[1:26:27] little story of Buddy Robinson I think
[1:26:29] it was I think it was him anyhow hope I
[1:26:32] got that right you know he was a uh just
[1:26:36] a man farmer man whatever uh supposedly
[1:26:40] a Christian you know we just say he
[1:26:42] loved the Lord and probably went to
[1:26:44] church on Sunday and you know but one
[1:26:48] day you know he was he was out plowing
[1:26:50] his field with his mule and you know he
[1:26:53] got to the place I don't know what
[1:26:54] happened happened with the mule but
[1:26:54] something went wrong and and and Buddy
[1:26:56] Robinson lost his cool and I guess he
[1:26:59] sounded like he had lost his cool a
[1:27:00] whole lot of times you know I don't I
[1:27:01] don't think that's be fitting for a
[1:27:02] Christian if you got a temper why don't
[1:27:04] you give it to God God will take care of
[1:27:05] it you know he lost his temper on that
[1:27:08] mule and he beat that thing and he
[1:27:09] grabbed it and he bit its ear and he was
[1:27:11] so angry and then you know he went off
[1:27:13] to church later that week and I no
[1:27:16] pardon me if I remember the story right
[1:27:18] he he the Holy Spirit got him so
[1:27:21] convicted that he had lost his temper
[1:27:23] and and and so he started apologizing to
[1:27:25] The Mule and the mule said if you don't
[1:27:27] got no more religion than that he's
[1:27:30] apologizing for what he did he said well
[1:27:31] if you don't got no more of God in your
[1:27:32] life than that you you need it and and
[1:27:35] and I say that respectfully there's a
[1:27:39] lot of times you know we just we people
[1:27:41] cover themselves with a blanket of
[1:27:42] religion right their lives really don't
[1:27:44] change they just cover themselves with a
[1:27:46] blanket they speak quotes they they
[1:27:49] speak scriptures but really their lives
[1:27:50] don't change just put them under
[1:27:52] pressure and you see what comes out
[1:27:55] very good come
[1:27:56] on you know and finally one day he got
[1:27:58] off they had the pastor brought in some
[1:28:00] Ministry and and you know he went to
[1:28:02] church that night and the Holy Spirit
[1:28:04] really got a hold of
[1:28:06] him he went back home you know and
[1:28:09] whistling thanking the lord and just
[1:28:11] singing and and he walked in the into
[1:28:13] his yard he come up on the porch of his
[1:28:15] house and as soon as he got close the
[1:28:16] big dog just kind of backed up and he'd
[1:28:18] been that place before too many boots
[1:28:20] you know people come home Angry and
[1:28:23] grumpy and this way that
[1:28:25] way come on it's pretty quiet in here
[1:28:29] right now we're all
[1:28:32] guilty we're all guilty
[1:28:35] amen and he's like it's okay
[1:28:38] boy God did something for my life and so
[1:28:40] the dog you know that night went talked
[1:28:42] to the rest of them they're like ah we
[1:28:43] heard this before God did something for
[1:28:45] me but his life from that moment proved
[1:28:50] what God had
[1:28:51] done his life proved what God had done
[1:28:55] hallelujah my goodness I'm way from far
[1:28:58] from where I need to
[1:29:05] be why don't you do me a favor when you
[1:29:07] go home why don't you read the book of
[1:29:09] Nehemiah you know you get just looking
[1:29:11] into scriptures nemiah you'll find out
[1:29:13] that that talking about the seals being
[1:29:17] broken here's God's children living in
[1:29:21] bondage and a message comes to Nehemiah
[1:29:24] and the burden of God falls on the
[1:29:26] man now here's a
[1:29:29] pastor message comes to nemiah and the
[1:29:31] burden of God falls on the man and the
[1:29:34] Bible says that he wept he cried he
[1:29:37] fasted he prayed why because he had
[1:29:39] heard of the condition of the church
[1:29:41] back home he heard of the condition and
[1:29:44] that his heart desired to see them where
[1:29:46] they ought to be amen a message came to
[1:29:49] Nehemiah Nehemiah receives the message
[1:29:51] he calls on God and then he goes before
[1:29:54] for the king and the King grants him all
[1:29:56] that he asks for yeah he takes his takes
[1:29:59] the king's treasury as it were and he
[1:30:02] heads back to Jerusalem to go and and
[1:30:04] and see what's going on and and why
[1:30:06] aren't the people living where they
[1:30:07] should be
[1:30:09] living he gets into Jerusalem he doesn't
[1:30:11] say a word did you say that this Sunday
[1:30:14] brother Ron if you don't want somebody
[1:30:16] to know you don't say nothing did you
[1:30:17] say that on suay he didn't say a
[1:30:19] word he simply stopped left everything
[1:30:22] and went and took his T her
[1:30:25] and then when he went to the
[1:30:28] people and he began to tell them look
[1:30:31] around is this how the children of God
[1:30:34] is this what God desires for our lives
[1:30:37] yeah is this what God desires did God
[1:30:39] desire for you to be uh you know to be
[1:30:42] so burdened down does God desire for the
[1:30:44] enemy to have preeminence in your life
[1:30:46] does God desire is that God's desire for
[1:30:49] us we're children of
[1:30:52] God Nehemiah gets the message Nehemiah
[1:30:55] takes the message when Nehemiah begins
[1:30:57] to preach the message to restore come on
[1:31:01] church to restore the kingdom the very
[1:31:04] walls of God the very the very walls
[1:31:07] that were there to protect him and the
[1:31:08] gates that should have been there
[1:31:09] protection the glory of the city it had
[1:31:12] all crumbled it had all
[1:31:15] crumbled and when Nehemiah begins to
[1:31:17] preach the message of what

[1:31:22] preaching a restoration ation
[1:31:25] message those listen those rocks of
[1:31:28] Revelation that had once been the walls
[1:31:30] that protected the children and had
[1:31:32] fallen down Nehemiah wasn't going to get
[1:31:34] new rocks he needed to get those rocks
[1:31:36] back into their position again so they
[1:31:38] would protect the children of God again
[1:31:41] and when he began to preach his message
[1:31:44] what happened go back and find out war

[1:34:12] that that the people of God begin to
[1:34:14] work and this one built from here to
[1:34:16] here this one built from here to here
