[16:53] don't know why but I've struggled with
[16:54] high blood pressure and so I come up for
[16:57] prayer at one point and just kind of
[16:58] left it in the Lord's hands and about a
[17:00] month ago I got pretty sick on a
[17:03] Saturday night that was the Sunday
[17:05] morning that we had brother Austin fill
[17:06] in for the for the song service and
[17:08] didn't eat anything for a couple days
[17:10] and later that week took my blood
[17:12] pressure again and everything was back
[17:13] down to normal and Tina said well maybe
[17:16] it's just cuz you haven't eaten anything
[17:17] well that might be so been monitoring my
[17:19] blood pressure for 5 weeks and it's been
[17:21] back down to normal so Lord Works in
[17:24] ways we don't
[17:27] understand but if it took getting sick
[17:29] that I appreciate that so just want to
[17:31] thank the Lord for his goodness I was

[27:00] he blesses me for it matters not just
[27:06] what be
[27:09] Falls for I love him till
[27:16] forever just
[27:18] [Music]
[27:21] because and I don't love him just be
[27:29] because he first loved
[27:35] me and I don't love
[27:39] him just
[27:43] because of
[27:45] [Music]
[27:50] calary for there's at
[27:53] least a million reasons

[35:24] powerful God guard our hearts amen yes
[35:29] watch over our lips yes keep us right
[35:32] before you yes and help us to learn to
[35:37] forgive turn with me to the Book of
[35:41] Luke chapter
[35:47] 7 verses 47-
[35:55] 50 Luke 7
[35:58] verse
[36:00] 47 wherefore I say unto
[36:03] thee her sins which are many are
[36:07] forgiven for she loved
[36:09] much but to whom little Is
[36:13] Forgiven the same loveth
[36:16] little and he said unto
[36:19] her thy sins are
[36:23] forgiven and they that sat at meat with
[36:26] him began to say with in
[36:28] themselves who is
[36:31] this That Forgives sins
[36:34] also and he said to the woman thy faith
[36:37] has saved thee go in peace amen may God
[36:41] add the blessing to his word you may be
[36:43] seated this morning in his
[36:45] presence
[36:48] Hallelujah I'd like to take for a
[36:50] thought this
[36:52] morning the forgiving
[36:55] heart the forgiving heart
[36:59] I like take a subject of learning to
[37:02] forgive
[37:06] others now I've spoken the last couple
[37:10] sermons concerning the heart we know the
[37:12] Bible speaks in multitudes of places
[37:16] about the
[37:18] heart it
[37:20] says that a heart is very deceitful and
[37:23] it's very Wicked who can know it amen
[37:30] and
[37:31] so I've spoke about the condemning
[37:35] heart I've spoke about healing the
[37:40] Brokenhearted I've spoke about the
[37:43] unconverted heart but I think one thing
[37:47] that many of us even as Believers have
[37:50] always got to put ourselves in
[37:52] remembrance of and that is a forgiving
[37:55] heart amen yes learning to
[37:59] forgive because it's not the nature you
[38:03] were born with to
[38:08] forgive and so I'd like to expound for a
[38:11] short time this morning concerning the
[38:13] forgiving
[38:14] heart I looked up the word
[38:17] forgive it means to excuse for a fault
[38:21] or an
[38:23] offense to
[38:26] Pardon to renounce anger or resentment
[38:31] against
[38:32] someone to put it away to renounce
[38:37] it it also means to absolve from payment
[38:40] of a
[38:44] debt I had a debt I couldn't
[38:49] pay and no matter how much I would live
[38:54] according to the law it's our
[38:56] righteousness
[38:58] and our justification does not come by
[39:01] how well we can keep the law in fact the
[39:04] Bible says by the keeping of the law is
[39:06] no man Justified before God so it's not
[39:10] how good we live but it's how good he
[39:12] has lived Hallelujah and we want to
[39:15] guard our hearts because our hearts can
[39:17] become
[39:18] hardened
[39:21] calloused and though we be religious and
[39:25] we go to church and we claim to be the
[39:27] bright to
[39:28] Christ God help us that we have a
[39:31] forgiving
[39:33] heart us
[39:36] Lord sometimes you can talk so spiritual
[39:39] yeah and act like you have your life
[39:42] together yeah but if your heart is not
[39:45] in the right
[39:47] condition then you're deceiving yourself
[39:50] the Bible says your religion is in
[39:54] vain Matthew 15: 7 through n the Bible
[39:58] says ye
[40:00] Hypocrites well did Isaiah a prophet
[40:03] prophesy of you
[40:05] saying this people draweth nigh unto me
[40:09] with their mouth notice they draw nigh
[40:11] unto him they worship god with their
[40:14] mouth and honth me with their lips but
[40:17] their
[40:18] heart is far from
[40:21] me but in vain do they worship me
[40:24] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[40:27] of of
[40:28] men so we know that the keeping of the
[40:31] law does not justify us before God but
[40:33] it is the act of faith that God gives
[40:37] you as a free gift for we are saved by
[40:41] th
[40:43] faith knowing that it is a gift from God
[40:47] it is not by anything you did but God
[40:50] gave it to you by his grace thank you
[40:55] Lord none of us can boast about how what
[40:58] faith we have because it's not
[41:01] ours it's freely given to us of God and
[41:05] I say this that when you ask God for
[41:07] more faith he gives you more faith you
[41:11] have to receive it you have to believe
[41:13] it you have to accept it your works is
[41:16] your faith
[41:18] expressed tell me you have faith show me
[41:20] your Works
[41:23] amen tell me you believe this message
[41:27] let me see your life that you live amen
[41:31] and you putting your faith into
[41:34] action did you know that forgiveness is
[41:37] one of the greatest attributes of God
[41:40] that you as a bride member can to put on
[41:44] display
[41:47] forgiveness to forgive
[41:49] others and yet many times we as message
[41:54] Believers can still see how that some
[41:57] of the Believers who are around
[42:02] us open their mouths very wide and they
[42:06] condemn and they criticize and they
[42:08] become so critical of others and yet
[42:12] within themselves feel so self-righteous
[42:15] because I'm glad I'm not like one of
[42:21] them how can we ask God to forgive us
[42:25] our trespasses
[42:28] if we do not forgive those who have
[42:30] trespassed against
[42:37] us I've personally seen and witness
[42:42] now and how that
[42:45] Brethren are not forgiving their
[42:48] families and loved
[42:50] ones because something had been done to
[42:52] them that offended
[42:54] them now the Bible says that offenses
[42:58] must needs
[43:01] come offenses will
[43:04] come if I ask anybody in here how many
[43:07] of you have never been
[43:11] offended it would be probably the little
[43:13] child that didn't know the
[43:16] question but the rest of you say yep yep
[43:19] why my
[43:20] brother or my sister or this one or that
[43:25] one or this pastor or this pre preacher
[43:27] or this quote message believer offended
[43:31] me which one of you have not been
[43:36] offended it depends on your attitude
[43:40] towards
[43:42] offenses that will display the very
[43:44] character of what you say you have
[43:47] within
[43:51] you we ask God create in me a clean
[43:54] heart
[43:55] right renew the right spirit in me there
[43:58] is nothing so defiling to a
[44:03] Christian than to have your spirit
[44:06] defiled because you are holding
[44:09] resentment or Vengeance or anger or
[44:13] hatred or frustrations towards someone
[44:18] else whether they did it on purpose or
[44:22] not you have no right to hold something
[44:26] against someone because Christ says You
[44:29] must F learn to
[44:32] forgive help us
[44:39] Lord Brother Brenham says in God hiding
[44:42] in
[44:44] Simplicity but God see he's he made and
[44:49] my printer printed that something
[44:51] happened here that he would meet man but
[44:54] it was under the shed blood and that's
[44:56] the only way no matter no matter how
[44:57] much we uh try another way that's the
[45:01] only place will God will meet man for
[45:05] Fellowship is under shed
[45:08] blood he talks about Israel under shed
[45:11] blood the only place they could worship
[45:13] was under blood in paragraph 69 there's
[45:16] only one place that man can meet and
[45:18] fellowship with God and fellowship with
[45:21] each
[45:23] other that's under the cross
[45:29] when each man accepts the blood of Jesus
[45:32] Christ I don't care in all of his pecul
[45:38] peculiarity I can't
[45:41] pecularity in all of his uniqueness let
[45:43] me say this to I I like this word
[45:46] because are we not all kind of peculiar
[45:48] in our ways let's face it you are a
[45:53] peculiar
[45:54] people and some of you are very
[45:57] very
[45:59] peculiar some of you are very unique but
[46:02] God still loves you thank you Lord amen
[46:06] I love God's
[46:08] diversity and I thank God that he can
[46:11] love us no matter how pecar we are and
[46:14] brother Brenham said look in all of the
[46:16] peculiarity he says he can still reach
[46:20] over and put his hand in the next man's
[46:23] hand and call him brother amen when we
[46:27] meet at the cross where Jesus died amen
[46:31] amen under the
[46:34] blood because of Calvary I can call any
[46:38] man
[46:39] brother that's right you know there's
[46:42] been others that have offended me sure
[46:45] they've done me wrong
[46:46] sure but God by his grace allows me to
[46:51] still give him the right hand of
[46:53] Fellowship why because God is forgiven
[46:57] me and he that's forgiven
[46:59] much loveth
[47:02] much and real Godly a goppo love covers
[47:07] a multitude of sins but we've got to
[47:11] learn to forgive it's not our nature to
[47:15] forgive
[47:19] right love and
[47:22] forgiveness are two of the most Godly
[47:25] attributes that we can dis lay in our
[47:30] lives love and forgiveness are always
[47:33] connected together within the
[47:35] scriptures and as I've been studying the
[47:38] last several days just on
[47:41] forgiveness and I think each one of
[47:43] us are overwhelmed about God's
[47:47] forgiveness to you yeah that he could
[47:51] love such a sinner such as I thank you
[47:55] Jesus we wel welcome God's forgiveness
[47:58] to us do we not we say thank you Lord
[48:01] for the cross thank you for the blood
[48:03] yes thank you for your
[48:06] forgiveness then how can we look down on
[48:09] others how can we hold a grudge how can
[48:11] we have something in our heart well I'll
[48:13] tell you what come on no matter what
[48:17] I'll never forgive them I will never say
[48:20] uh I'm sorry I will never
[48:23] receive whatever excuse we have
[48:27] how can you Harbor that in your heart
[48:31] brother Brenham said it will defile your
[48:33] spirit and keep you out of the
[48:35] Kingdom God help
[48:38] us
[48:44] amen the type of
[48:46] person that is always speaking their
[48:50] mind without being sensitive to others
[48:54] feelings yeah will always always have a
[48:58] few
[48:59] friends why they be who wants to be
[49:03] around somebody who's always truthfully
[49:06] honest you have to be careful about
[49:08] those truthfully honest people you know
[49:12] sometimes you don't have to see
[49:15] everything honey does this dress look
[49:19] nice on
[49:22] me yeah
[49:27] what I'm saying is sometimes you can so
[49:30] be so brutally honest to somebody that
[49:32] you offend
[49:35] them and it can happen at an early age I
[49:38] remember the first time I was so
[49:40] offended I I I was invited to a party it
[49:45] was probably sixth grade sixth grade I
[49:48] don't know how old I was but I a sixth
[49:51] grader and we was invited to a Halloween
[49:55] party
[49:57] and we went to the party and it was a
[49:59] dance party where they put on M I ain't
[50:01] never danced in my
[50:06] life so they put the music on and there
[50:09] was a girl there named
[50:11] Rosemary and
[50:12] Rosary asked me if I would
[50:16] dance well I'm in a costume and I got a
[50:18] mask on and so yeah okay get out here
[50:21] and so I made a fool of myself and guess
[50:23] what while the music is going on I'm
[50:25] having a good time I'm
[50:27] jerking around and having a spaz attack
[50:30] up here and it looks like I'm convulsing
[50:33] over something you
[50:34] know but I was having fun I really was
[50:38] getting into it and I thought I just
[50:40] watched everybody else and I kind of
[50:42] mimic what they did and boy I I was
[50:45] really enjoying myself and after the
[50:49] dance was over and everything she came
[50:52] and she says you are a horrible dancer
[50:58] thank you yeah thank
[51:02] you my dancing days were over right
[51:05] then honestly and you know she she had
[51:10] been a friend up until that
[51:12] time and um so it was
[51:17] until our 10year anniversary graduation
[51:22] we graduated in 1971 so it was
[51:25] 1981 they had a high school reunion and
[51:29] there was
[51:30] Rosemary now I had not talked to her
[51:33] since sixth grade went through Junior
[51:36] High School not a
[51:39] word went through high school not a word
[51:42] see you're in the
[51:46] hallway I was Ice Cold
[51:49] Man and rosemary cornered
[51:53] me and said Ron can we not be friends
[52:01] wow don't you know what you did to
[52:06] me I what I'm saying is even at a very
[52:11] young age you can be offended enough to
[52:13] where you won't speak you won't talk to
[52:16] him you will shun them you will Harbor
[52:18] something in your heart when it really
[52:20] wasn't that big of a deal but you at the
[52:23] time at the moment it was a big deal
[52:28] here I held that in my heart all those
[52:31] years and I told her I said Rosemary I'm
[52:34] going to be honest with you remember
[52:36] that day
[52:39] Dancing Yeah I said I was having fun you
[52:43] said I'm a horrible
[52:46] dancer Ron I was I said yeah that was
[52:51] it over finished
[52:54] fenito she says didn't mean it to hurt
[52:58] you amen I said well you
[53:01] did so
[53:06] anyway that just goes to show it doesn't
[53:08] matter what age yeah right it can be
[53:11] just a young kid sixth grade who would
[53:14] think that sixth
[53:16] graders could hold a
[53:19] grudge to have
[53:22] resentment against someone I even had
[53:25] her in a couple class
[53:28] and
[53:29] and I think one time in the class she
[53:32] was sitting right next to
[53:35] me if I could have built a wall I would
[53:37] have built a
[53:38] wall but don't we build walls within our
[53:42] spirits and and and and and we give
[53:44] people the the idea don't look at me
[53:48] don't breathe towards me it's just
[53:52] little things we hold because we do not
[53:55] learn to forgive
[54:01] brother Bram said the way we have
[54:03] Fellowship one with another as we come
[54:05] under the cross then I give you the
[54:08] right hand of fellowship and say hey
[54:11] you're my brother so the same thing
[54:14] applies today if we want to call one
[54:16] another
[54:17] brother even those who have offended you
[54:19] come under the cross am
[54:24] yes let the Holy Spirit come into your
[54:26] heart and cleanse you from any kind of
[54:33] resentment there's always going to be
[54:35] someone who without disregard to someone
[54:39] else's feelings will say things very
[54:43] insensitive to
[54:47] others and sometimes it really isn't
[54:51] what you say but how you say
[54:53] it do you understand
[54:57] sometimes it's how you say
[55:00] it more than what you
[55:04] said well that's just the way that I am
[55:07] and if you don't like it because I just
[55:09] want to be
[55:11] honest well that kind of
[55:14] attitude is costic amen
[55:18] is
[55:24] repulsive some of our most outwardly
[55:26] religious people even within the
[55:31] message are guilty of
[55:35] seeing
[55:37] and all kinds of evil against
[55:41] others they can criticize others and
[55:44] look down and criticize everyone else
[55:46] but they cannot see the hypocrisy with
[55:48] it in their own
[55:52] life James 1 and 26 says
[55:57] If any man among you seems to be
[56:04] religious do you know any religious
[56:08] Believers any of you that seems to be
[56:12] religious and bridleth not his tongue
[56:16] but deceives his own

[1:02:30] you can only forgive you as you forgive
[1:02:37] others as I studied in the last several
[1:02:39] days I learned that in every Pagan
[1:02:42] ungodly religion they have nothing in
[1:02:45] their religion saying about
[1:02:49] forgiveness
[1:02:51] nothing in fact in the western culture
[1:02:54] that we have surrounding us we see take
[1:02:58] revenge hey baby it's payback
[1:03:04] time Western culture feeds on sex and
[1:03:08] violence amen not only do Americans
[1:03:12] condone violence we like
[1:03:14] it make my day
[1:03:18] baby

[1:03:49] that you you come here man boom next
[1:03:51] thing you know you're having a an issue

[1:04:04] Testament let me show
[1:04:06] you speaks about seeking Vengeance for
[1:04:10] others and is pretty harsh concerning
[1:04:13] the law because in Exodus
[1:04:15] 21 verses 23 and 25 and if any mief
[1:04:21] follow then Thou shalt give Life For
[1:04:23] Life eye for eyee tooth part
[1:04:26] two hand for
[1:04:29] hand fool foot for foot burning for
[1:04:35] burning wound for wound stripe for
[1:04:39] stripe quote for
[1:04:45] quote see what I'm saying amen many
[1:04:48] times brother Brenham said now watch we
[1:04:51] just instead of trying to find what we
[1:04:53] Fellowship around let's find something
[1:04:55] we don't Fellowship around and then I
[1:04:57] want to prove my point to you and you
[1:04:59] prove your point to me and while you're
[1:05:02] seeing your point I'm not even listening
[1:05:04] I'm looking up my next quote to go ahead
[1:05:05] and throw at him that's true huh come
[1:05:09] on then the next thing you know it
[1:05:11] breaks our
[1:05:14] fellowship and you get
[1:05:16] frustrated you become critical yeah you
[1:05:19] defile your spirit you go to church
[1:05:21] you're hearing the word and you're
[1:05:23] sitting there and somebody else is in
[1:05:26] the church and you had it out with them
[1:05:29] next thing you know they're on that
[1:05:30] corner of the church and the other one
[1:05:32] on that corner and hoping that they
[1:05:34] don't ever get
[1:05:35] seated by Brother Arnold next to
[1:05:41] you Leviticus 24:1 19- 21 and if any man
[1:05:46] cause a blemish in his
[1:05:48] neighbor as he hath done so shall it be
[1:05:52] done to him breach for breach eye for Cy
[1:05:56] tooth for tooth as he hath caused a
[1:06:00] blemish in a man
[1:06:02] so excuse me shall it be done to him
[1:06:05] again and he that kth a beast he will he
[1:06:09] shall restore and he that hath killed a
[1:06:11] man he shall be put to
[1:06:15] death now as I begin to look at this we
[1:06:18] see that this type of
[1:06:20] behavior God was showing in the Old
[1:06:24] Testament with eye for eye tooth for
[1:06:28] tooth and I want you to understand I
[1:06:30] thank God for the types in the Old
[1:06:32] Testament but when the New Testament
[1:06:36] come Christ comes with a New
[1:06:40] Covenant he says it was written that you
[1:06:43] do this Thou shalt not
[1:06:46] kill but I tell you that if a man is
[1:06:50] angry with his
[1:06:52] brother and calls him fool
[1:06:56] brother Bram said you don't have to kill
[1:06:58] a man physically you can kill him or
[1:07:01] kill his influence
[1:07:03] right
[1:07:09] right I thank God that brother Brenham
[1:07:13] tells us that Christ came to show us a
[1:07:15] better way
[1:07:17] amen turning the other cheek is not
[1:07:22] easy but it is the way of Christ amen
[1:07:26] yes amen getting and going the second
[1:07:29] mile is not
[1:07:31] easy but it is the way of
[1:07:35] Christ letting go of your temper and
[1:07:38] resentment is not
[1:07:41] easy but it is the way of Christ
[1:07:44] otherwise we can
[1:07:47] come and we can sit in church under the
[1:07:52] ministry of the word with the Holy
[1:07:54] Spirit moving among the
[1:07:56] people and you can sit there and because
[1:08:00] you have got a hardness of your heart
[1:08:04] and you
[1:08:06] are holding a
[1:08:08] grudge holding a feeling or you have a
[1:08:13] temper nobody here has a temper I'm sure
[1:08:15] you
[1:08:16] don't nobody
[1:08:21] does I I want to go over this I love the
[1:08:24] message of the hour because brother
[1:08:26] brandom even talks to us about the
[1:08:29] everyday life things that we go through
[1:08:32] yes and how that we handle them or how
[1:08:35] that we mishandle
[1:08:38] them I found a quote the other day
[1:08:41] Nikita Christa leader of the Soviet
[1:08:44] Union many years ago Nikita
[1:08:47] cha he says we Communists have much in
[1:08:51] common with the teaching of
[1:08:53] Christ my only
[1:08:56] difference with Christ is when I am
[1:08:59] struck on the right cheek by someone I
[1:09:01] strike back on the left cheek so hard
[1:09:03] that his head falls
[1:09:06] off he say you see we have something in
[1:09:12] common instead of just turning the cheek
[1:09:15] I'm going to strike harder right you
[1:09:17] follow
[1:09:20] me Jesus Christ taught and practiced
[1:09:24] self-control contr when he was riled
[1:09:27] against when all manner of evil was said
[1:09:30] against him he stood there as a lamb
[1:09:35] right you know the problem
[1:09:38] with lamb and lion is you have to know
[1:09:42] which time to be a lion and which time
[1:09:45] to be a
[1:09:49] lamb so much of the time the Bible says
[1:09:53] what blessing is it to you when people
[1:09:56] say all manner of evil against you but
[1:10:00] you did something to kind of get them to
[1:10:02] say
[1:10:03] it and you take it
[1:10:06] lightly it said but what if you do
[1:10:09] good and your good is evil spoken of and
[1:10:13] they reproach you and persecute you and
[1:10:16] say all manner of evil against you
[1:10:20] falsely then when you take it that is
[1:10:24] glory to God
[1:10:28] but that's not our
[1:10:30] nature see nonviolence and
[1:10:34] self-restraint is one of the greatest
[1:10:37] evidences of your personal
[1:10:40] character each one of you will be given
[1:10:43] tests on being
[1:10:44] offended rightfully or wrongfully you
[1:10:47] will be offended by someone at some time
[1:10:49] in your
[1:10:50] life but how you react to that offense
[1:10:54] right will display play and show the
[1:10:56] evidence of your
[1:11:00] character you have a right to react on
[1:11:02] how you want
[1:11:03] to you have a right to forgive or not
[1:11:06] the choice is
[1:11:10] yours forgiveness is a choice that you
[1:11:13] have to make true you have to learn to
[1:11:16] forgive amen you have to choose
[1:11:20] forgiveness versus
[1:11:22] Vengeance because Bible says vengeance
[1:11:26] is mine sayith the Lord I will
[1:11:28] repay you don't have to do it the time's
[1:11:35] coming remember this one
[1:11:38] thing if you do not forgive
[1:11:41] others you will not be forgiven amen
[1:11:45] forgiveness then is based upon condition
[1:11:54] am you're going to be slapped with an
[1:11:58] insult or remark sometime in your
[1:12:01] life perhaps you deserved it or you
[1:12:04] didn't deserve it doesn't
[1:12:06] matter Christ was smitten and he did not
[1:12:09] retaliate nor did he revile
[1:12:12] back here's another scriptural of
[1:12:16] example of forgiveness in the
[1:12:20] Bible brother Mark I'd like you to read
[1:12:22] if you would let's turn to the Book of
[1:12:24] Matthew chapter chap
[1:12:27] 18 verses 21- 25 the Bible is full of
[1:12:32] teaching us how to forgive
[1:12:35] amen but we've got to choose to do that
[1:12:39] that's right we sing the song to be like
[1:12:46] Jesus Oh to be like
[1:12:51] Jesus on Earth th Lord
[1:12:57] to be like
[1:13:00] him but are there are
[1:13:04] exceptions when someone offends
[1:13:08] me then I have a
[1:13:12] ride I could just keep going
[1:13:15] but you know where I'm
[1:13:18] going all right here we are Matthew 18:
[1:13:23] 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord
[1:13:26] how often shall my brother sin against
[1:13:28] me and I forgive him till seven times so
[1:13:32] here's Peter I love Peter you hey man
[1:13:35] this guy offending me how many times do
[1:13:37] I have
[1:13:39] to how often do I have to forgive him
[1:13:42] yeah till seven times watch what Jesus
[1:13:45] said Jesus saith unto him I say not unto
[1:13:48] thee until seven times but until 70 time
[1:13:51] 7 okay wait a second 70 time 7
[1:13:55] anybody take math in
[1:13:57] school what does that
[1:13:59] mean
[1:14:03] 490 490 times well some of you are close
[1:14:07] you're maybe 478 so
[1:14:10] far but what I'm saying is he said
[1:14:13] Peter's asking the question how often do
[1:14:17] I forgive my
[1:14:18] brother seven times in a day no 7 times
[1:14:23] 70 49 90 times in fact there are some
[1:14:27] brothers that
[1:14:29] loved to make the score go
[1:14:34] up there are some people you are blessed
[1:14:38] to just see them come oh blessed is he
[1:14:41] who comes in the name of the Lord man
[1:14:44] let's go to
[1:14:45] lunch and there are others you
[1:14:50] go hey brother
[1:14:56] no I'm busy for
[1:15:00] lunch there are some people Saints of
[1:15:05] got that are hard to get along
[1:15:09] with that's
[1:15:12] true there are some people I will never
[1:15:14] ask to go fishing with
[1:15:18] me that doesn't mean I don't love
[1:15:21] them but you understand what I'm talking
[1:15:24] about
[1:15:25] okay and so let's let's keep reading
[1:15:29] here therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:15:31] Kingdom of Heaven is likened go ahead
[1:15:34] unto a certain King which would take
[1:15:36] account of his servants and when he had
[1:15:39] begun to reckon one was brought unto him
[1:15:42] which owed him 10,000 talents
[1:15:45] 10,000 talents wow but for as much as he
[1:15:49] had not to pay his Lord commanded him to
[1:15:52] be sold and his wife and children and
[1:15:54] all that had and payment to be made okay
[1:15:56] so now okay buddy you can't pay all
[1:15:59] right wife family kids your car
[1:16:02] everything man I'm going to you know I'm
[1:16:04] going to take it all from you go ahead
[1:16:08] the servant therefore fell down and
[1:16:09] worshiped him saying Lord have patience
[1:16:11] with me and I will pay thee all then the
[1:16:14] Lord of that servant was moved with
[1:16:15] compassion and loosed him and forgave
[1:16:18] him the debt but the same servant went
[1:16:20] out and found one of his fellow servants
[1:16:22] which owed him 100 P 100
[1:16:25] and he laid hands on him and took him by
[1:16:27] the throat saying pay me that thou owest
[1:16:30] and his fellow servant fell down at his
[1:16:31] feet and besought him saying have
[1:16:33] patience with me and I will pay thee all
[1:16:35] and he would not but went and cast him
[1:16:37] into prison till he should pay the debt
[1:16:40] so when his fellow servant saw what was
[1:16:42] done they were very sorry and came and
[1:16:44] sold unto told unto their lord all that
[1:16:46] was done then his Lord after that he had
[1:16:49] called him and said said unto him oh
[1:16:51] thou Wicked servant I forgave thee all
[1:16:53] that debt because thou desired s me
[1:16:56] should us not thou also have had
[1:16:58] compassion look at this on thy fellow
[1:17:00] servant should you not have compassion
[1:17:03] even as I had pity on thee and his Lord
[1:17:06] was wroth and delivered him to the
[1:17:07] tormentors till he should pay all that
[1:17:10] was due unto him so likewise shall my
[1:17:12] heavenly father do also unto you do unto
[1:17:15] you if ye from your hearts forgive not
[1:17:18] everyone is brother their
[1:17:21] trespasses aren't we so quick to say
[1:17:23] Lord thank you
[1:17:25] for the grace for the Forgiveness thank
[1:17:28] you Lord oh I take it unto myself I'm
[1:17:32] forgiven hallelujah thank you Lord for
[1:17:34] your forgiveness to my
[1:17:38] debt but when
[1:17:40] somebody
[1:17:41] trespasses come
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:45] on I ain't forgiving
[1:17:48] you you owe this buddy and I hope you're
[1:17:51] going to pay till the uttermost far you
[1:17:53] get this attitude you're holier than
[1:17:56] thou you're better than that
[1:17:58] person listen I ain't I ain't saying
[1:18:00] what they said or did against you was
[1:18:03] right or wrong but it's your attitude
[1:18:05] I'm dealing with amen do you understand
[1:18:09] CU otherwise we could justify an eye for
[1:18:11] an eye tooth for a tooth I tell you what
[1:18:14] and you get this
[1:18:16] attitude on you you're going to
[1:18:19] pay come on I don't have to like you I
[1:18:22] don't have to be around I could care
[1:18:23] less and get this old attitude about
[1:18:28] you forgiveness is
[1:18:31] costly it will cost you
[1:18:35] something and forgiveness is not a
[1:18:38] one-time
[1:18:40] event it is a continuing process in your
[1:18:44] life you will have to learn to forgive
[1:18:48] over and over yes and
[1:18:51] over and over
[1:18:56] yes
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:59] again and
[1:19:03] again sometimes we say within ourselves
[1:19:06] why should I
[1:19:07] forgive don't they understand what they
[1:19:09] have done somebody has to pay for
[1:19:14] this I don't get mad I get
[1:19:19] even the old cliche we often
[1:19:23] disguise and I as our desire to get back
[1:19:26] at
[1:19:27] someone we have this Natural Instinct in
[1:19:30] nature that we want to get even your
[1:19:33] natural birth has a nature not to
[1:19:35] forgive others listen to what I said
[1:19:38] your natural birth your carnal man has a
[1:19:42] nature within it not to
[1:19:45] forgive but your spiritual New Birth yes
[1:19:50] transforms The Old
[1:19:53] Man and transforms his temperament thank
[1:19:57] you Lord yes
[1:20:00] amen hatred breeds
[1:20:03] hatred temper breeds
[1:20:06] temper why should I
[1:20:10] forgive see brother Brenham says samini
[1:20:13] in church age organization breeds
[1:20:18] hatred it destroys
[1:20:21] Fellowship it makes bitterness
[1:20:25] that is why what my means this is what
[1:20:28] samna was full of
[1:20:30] bitterness a root of bitterness defiles
[1:20:35] many so more and more defilement was
[1:20:39] coming in every
[1:20:41] age would feel its scars that means lot
[1:20:45] do you see you that means during the
[1:20:48] time of we coming in the maturity of the
[1:20:51] word and we call ourselves we are no
[1:20:53] longer Church we're bride
[1:20:55] it will carry right over into this
[1:20:58] dispensation of the
[1:21:01] Bride
[1:21:04] yes bride never seeks
[1:21:07] Vengeance bride does not persecute
[1:21:11] bride before conversion you might have
[1:21:14] had a
[1:21:15] temper always sought to even the score
[1:21:18] with others but after your conversion it
[1:21:23] changes right it changes if it hasn't
[1:21:27] changed you're not born
[1:21:30] again the prophet had his conver before
[1:21:33] his conversion he got into so many
[1:21:35] fights how many knows that he list this
[1:21:38] a fighting
[1:21:40] little
[1:21:42] Irishman excuse me brother stepen little
[1:21:45] fighting fighting
[1:21:47] Irish watch this questions ansers 64
[1:21:51] brother Brenham when someone gets on me
[1:21:54] your steps on my
[1:21:57] toes this might be a good
[1:22:00] one steps on my
[1:22:02] toes as the old saying is my temper
[1:22:06] Rises how can I overcome this thing I
[1:22:09] know the Lord will have to do it but
[1:22:13] what can I do in my heart I don't want
[1:22:15] this
[1:22:16] thing here's his answer
[1:22:22] sweeten my goodness
[1:22:26] sweeten your temper with prayer with
[1:22:29] prayer
[1:22:32] wow then make up your
[1:22:37] mind I don't guess there's too many
[1:22:39] people in this building had more temper
[1:22:41] than I did to begin with my mouth mashed
[1:22:44] all the
[1:22:46] time I'd taken a lot of my meals out of
[1:22:48] a
[1:22:50] straw my mother as you know was half
[1:22:52] Indian and my father was an Irish man a
[1:22:55] Kentucky Irish at that every both of
[1:22:58] them had enough temper to fight a buz
[1:23:00] saww that's Mom and
[1:23:02] Dad both of them and it fell down to Big
[1:23:06] Bad
[1:23:07] Bill
[1:23:09] right
[1:23:12] now I
[1:23:13] said I thought I could never be a
[1:23:16] Christian but when the Holy Spirit came
[1:23:18] into my life that done it I had a woman
[1:23:22] one time who went out to cut off the
[1:23:24] light and that day I had uh hair on top
[1:23:29] of my head she said you little kinky
[1:23:32] headed
[1:23:34] idiotic I told her I said woman you
[1:23:36] oughtn't to curse like that oh don't you
[1:23:39] fear God she said you little kinky
[1:23:42] headed idiot I if I wanted somebody to
[1:23:45] talk to me about things like that I
[1:23:47] wouldn't get a half wit like
[1:23:50] you
[1:23:53] woo come on come on man come on woman I
[1:23:56] know a man he come here
[1:23:59] woman instead of you cleaning the house
[1:24:02] I'm going to clean your
[1:24:04] clo now look he he admitted he had a
[1:24:08] temper this woman is now and and and she
[1:24:11] goes on she called me a blankety
[1:24:14] blankety name oh my have that uh been a
[1:24:18] year farther in other words if it had
[1:24:19] been before his conversion right I
[1:24:23] always said a man that is a woman Wasn't
[1:24:25] Man Enough to strike a man but I might
[1:24:28] have broke that that time calling my
[1:24:31] M calling my mother a name like that but
[1:24:34] you know what it never even phased me
[1:24:40] wow I said I'll pray for
[1:24:45] you I knowed right
[1:24:48] then something had happened to me praise
[1:24:51] the Lord you know the even
[1:24:55] that I done when I was a kid fighting
[1:24:57] almost killed five men at one time took
[1:25:00] a rifle loaded was 16 shots and when
[1:25:03] them boys beat me up because I was a
[1:25:06] Kian anybody here from
[1:25:12] Kentucky try to pick on this kcki and
[1:25:14] over
[1:25:16] here they picking on him because he was
[1:25:19] from
[1:25:20] Kentucky moved to Indiana
[1:25:25] no other reason I couldn't even hold my
[1:25:27] head up one would hold me by the hands
[1:25:30] like this the other one and stand there
[1:25:33] with a rock in his hand and pound me in
[1:25:35] the
[1:25:36] face till I was just
[1:25:41] lifeless see he would have killed those
[1:25:43] boys would he not amen amen would have
[1:25:46] killed those boys yes but
[1:25:49] God knowing that he had a work to do
[1:25:53] yeah wow watched over him wouldn't let
[1:25:56] the bullets go off cuz he got he got the
[1:25:58] rifle which one of you boys want to die
[1:26:01] first he said I got to crying then I got
[1:26:05] to screaming and laughing like a

[1:26:11] which one of you boys want to die
[1:26:14] first they jumping over logs and he snap
[1:26:17] snap snap not a bullet goes off then he
[1:26:21] gets mad at God
[1:26:22] why he would have killed them
[1:26:25] boys now here let me give you another
[1:26:28] example I love the transparency of the
[1:26:30] Prophet giving us life examples of
[1:26:34] things about being converted and
[1:26:36] pre-conversion and different things now
[1:26:39] brother renam in the sermon having a
[1:26:41] conference years ago I used to have an

[1:35:26] stage of
[1:35:28] insanity now I will tell you if any of
[1:35:32] you have ever lost control of your
[1:35:34] temper and you were in a fight I can
[1:35:36] only relate this to you one time in my
[1:35:40] life I went to Monrovia High School and
[1:35:42] we had racial
[1:35:45] riots I've played sports with all of my
[1:35:48] black friends but when it comes down to
[1:35:50] having white versus black we had racial
[1:35:53] riots we were the worst school in LA
[1:35:57] county for racial riots racial
[1:36:02] tension and one day we had this
[1:36:05] confrontation whites versus blacks and
[1:36:07] we're standing there and all the time
[1:36:09] there's this hey guy hey I tell you what
[1:36:12] come on over here you think you bad come
[1:36:14] on
[1:36:18] man so I remember getting into a race
[1:36:21] riot I remember fighting
[1:36:25] and I remembered yes and when the only
[1:36:28] thing I can liken it to is to hand toand
[1:36:30] combat in
[1:36:38] war about an hour and a half
[1:36:42] later I come out of
[1:36:44] it I don't know where I'd been for the
[1:36:47] last hour and a
[1:36:49] half I have no
[1:36:52] recollection my friend
[1:36:54] said
[1:36:56] wow cuz they're trying to pull me away
[1:36:58] and I'm I I'm just I'm I'm I'm nuts I
[1:37:01] lost
[1:37:05] it that was prior to my
[1:37:10] conversion
[1:37:12] temper will drive you insane amen
[1:37:15] hatred feeling like you got to get after
[1:37:18] somebody go after
[1:37:22] them yeah
[1:37:27] brother Bram said in the infallibility
[1:37:30] of God's word God don't want you to be
[1:37:34] sad you know what temper does that old
[1:37:37] temper that one of the aess old things
[1:37:42] about 60% of the cause of all
[1:37:47] sickness is temper
[1:37:51] wow now this is coming from a man who's
[1:37:54] got Divine
[1:37:56] Healing with a gift to pray for the sick
[1:37:59] he said 60% of all those that come up
[1:38:02] the sickness was called where it's cause
[1:38:05] here's the root cause
[1:38:09] temper you say see Tantrums you fly
[1:38:13] loose remember you just developing a
[1:38:16] cancer an ulcer or something like that
[1:38:19] when you do it when you get all stewed
[1:38:21] up about somebody I won't let
[1:38:24] uh I I won't go back there anymore wait
[1:38:26] till I give them a piece of my mind all
[1:38:28] right remember you're the one that's
[1:38:30] going to pay for
[1:38:34] it do you see that here he our Prophet
[1:38:38] is saying oh you're getting mad at them
[1:38:40] and they you know I want to give them a
[1:38:41] piece of my
[1:38:43] mind and he says guess what he says
[1:38:45] you're the one that's going to pay for
[1:38:51] it help me Lord amen sir to lay all of
[1:38:57] everything before you and give it to
[1:39:03] you the Bible says in Ephesians 4:26 and
[1:39:07] 27 be angry and sin
[1:39:12] not let not the sun go down upon your
[1:39:17] wrath neither give place to the devil
[1:39:20] anger and resentment are symptoms that's
[1:39:22] always accompanied
[1:39:25] unforgiveness let me say it again anger
[1:39:28] and resentment accompany
[1:39:32] unforgiveness there are different kinds
[1:39:34] of degrees of anger like on a
[1:39:37] thermometer let me just go over this
[1:39:40] quickly you start at the bottom with the
[1:39:43] thermometer and you rise to the top the
[1:39:45] bottom is that icy cold
[1:39:48] anger what we or many will call
[1:39:51] indifference
[1:39:53] I don't care I don't care about others I
[1:39:56] could care less you got this cold
[1:39:59] Icy indifference you become cold silent
[1:40:02] like a frosty morning and you got no
[1:40:07] jacket you give the cold shoulder and
[1:40:09] you give the icy
[1:40:12] stairs you ever known somebody to do
[1:40:16] that you ever felt
[1:40:19] it
[1:40:22] huh rising up you come to the normal
[1:40:25] temper of anger it causes IR ability
[1:40:29] bitter words sharp words you become
[1:40:31] impatient
[1:40:32] critical and with heated words of anger
[1:40:35] it causes you to lose your joy and
[1:40:38] become frustrated at
[1:40:40] everything then we go all the way to the
[1:40:43] top with
[1:40:45] boiling and scalding words of
[1:40:52] anger so when the face gets red and the
[1:40:55] eyes
[1:40:56] bulge the veins
[1:40:59] pop go ahead make my
[1:41:05] day this kind of anger blows
[1:41:09] up it's
[1:41:12] explosive and gets physically
[1:41:16] abusive it is the seething
[1:41:19] cauldron of terrible
[1:41:21] outrage no one blows up
[1:41:25] nicely that's right
[1:41:28] forgiveness is not a one-time gift but
[1:41:32] that is imparted to you it's not one
[1:41:33] time right must be given in
[1:41:37] every circumstance that arises against
[1:41:40] you and you must learn how to forgive so
[1:41:43] that you can be
[1:41:46] forgiven you want everyone to be lenient
[1:41:49] on your transgressions don't you oh
[1:41:51] thank you Lord you forgiven me

[1:57:42] till I went first and made that right
[1:57:45] see if I could get straightened

[1:58:16] kind one to another
[1:58:19] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:58:22] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[1:58:25] forgiven you
[1:58:27] amen Colossians 3:
[1:58:31] 13 and 14 forbearing one another and
[1:58:34] forgiving one
[1:58:35] another If any man have a quarrel
[1:58:39] against any even as Christ forgave you
[1:58:44] so also do
[1:58:45] [Music]
[1:58:50] youen above all these things put on
[1:58:53] charity which is the bond of
[1:58:55] perfectness there is only one sin that
[1:58:58] cannot be
[1:59:01] forgiven the sin of
[1:59:05] blasphemy these scoffers and false
[1:59:08] accusers here that are rising up
[1:59:11] now and sending out their YouTubes and
[1:59:14] all of their hate mail and everything
[1:59:16] against this Prophet brother R said if
[1:59:18] you don't agree with it don't say
[1:59:21] anything against it that's
[1:59:24] right that that woman at time looked at
[1:59:28] the picture of the pillar of fire on
[1:59:31] someone's mantle looked at it and she
[1:59:34] she she
[1:59:35] laughed he said she blasphemed the Holy
[1:59:42] Ghost Matthew 12:31 and 32 wherefore I
[1:59:46] say unto you all manner of sin and
[1:59:49] blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but
[1:59:51] the blasphemy me against the Holy Ghost
[1:59:53] shall not be forgiven unto men and
[1:59:56] whosoever speaketh a word against the
[1:59:58] son of man it should be forgiven him but
[2:00:00] whosoever speaketh against the Holy
[2:00:03] Ghost it shall not be forgiven him
[2:00:05] neither in this
[2:00:07] world neither in the world to
[2:00:13] [Music]
[2:00:17] come now let me just give you this one
[2:00:20] quote here because I I want to when I
[2:00:23] read it it really
[2:00:25] spoke Queen of the
[2:00:28] South he said that he perceiving their
[2:00:31] thoughts in their heart they said this
[2:00:34] man's a faker he's a
[2:00:36] beelove what a spirit to be on a
[2:00:39] person Jesus knew it said you can call
[2:00:42] the son of man that kind of a name it'll
[2:00:44] be forgiven you but when the Holy Ghost
[2:00:46] has come and you speak that against him
[2:00:50] it'll never be forgiven you in the
[2:00:51] moment moment forgiven you in this world
[2:00:54] or in the world to come weigh that in
[2:00:57] the balance for a few moments and think
[2:00:59] what that
[2:01:01] means it shall be never be forgiven to
[2:01:05] man to blaspheme against the Holy Ghost
[2:01:07] because they said this is an unclean
[2:01:10] Spirit now many of you have wondered
[2:01:13] what is the unpardonable sin there it is
[2:01:18] he says so I'm going to the bottom of
[2:01:20] this paragraph So look the scripture is
[2:01:23] the background Jesus said if you speak a
[2:01:25] word against the Holy Spirit it shall
[2:01:27] never be forgiven you all sin shall be
[2:01:31] forgiven except that sin that's
[2:01:34] unbelief oh what a horrible thing that
[2:01:38] unbelief is and the most unbelievers are
[2:01:42] religious
[2:01:44] people the most
[2:01:47] unbelievers I quote again it's religious
[2:01:51] people
[2:01:52] it's been in every age and this age is
[2:01:55] no
[2:01:56] exception it's religious
[2:01:58] people who are
[2:02:01] unbelievers and each one of these guys
[2:02:03] that are coming against the
[2:02:06] message oh they claim to be real
[2:02:09] Christians we want to expose what this
[2:02:12] Prophet has done where he made all these
[2:02:20] mistakes let me just close close with
[2:02:22] this cuz I think this is
[2:02:24] very mindful I'm not going to read it
[2:02:26] I'll just put it back into your
[2:02:29] remembrance there was a man in the
[2:02:31] scripture who was rejected by his
[2:02:32] Brethren sold into slavery put into a
[2:02:36] pit told her father he was dead who was
[2:02:40] it Jose
[2:02:42] Joseph if anybody could inact
[2:02:47] Revenge man you talk about a perfect
[2:02:50] setup here he is
[2:02:53] he is there he's at the right hand of
[2:02:56] pharaoh and he's got his brothers there
[2:02:58] and they don't know who he
[2:03:05] [Music]
[2:03:06] is Joseph could have thought within
[2:03:09] himself
[2:03:10] ha he who laughs
[2:03:13] last laughs
[2:03:15] best it's amazing because he put out all
[2:03:19] the Egyptians and then he begins to
[2:03:21] speak Hebrew takes off his
[2:03:25] hat I'm Joseph your
[2:03:28] brother did they
[2:03:31] Rejoice what did they say he's going to
[2:03:33] kill us
[2:03:34] man he's going to enact Vengeance on us
[2:03:41] right Jacob has just
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:50] died and Jacob told the Brethren to say
[2:03:54] this jacob says to say to
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:04:00] Joseph so you shall say unto Joseph
[2:04:02] forgive I pray thee now the trespass of
[2:04:06] thy
[2:04:08] Brethren and their sin for they did unto
[2:04:12] thee
[2:04:13] evil and now we pray thee forgive the
[2:04:17] trespasses of the Servants of the god of
[2:04:20] thy father
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:25] and Joseph
[2:04:29] wept he says you
[2:04:32] thought to do evil against
[2:04:35] me but God meant it unto
[2:04:40] good to bring to pass as in this day to
[2:04:46] save much people
[2:04:49] alive here was a man that could have at
[2:04:53] that very
[2:04:54] moment could have said I got him man I'm
[2:04:58] going to put you guys in prison I'm
[2:05:00] going to make you pay the price cuz this
[2:05:02] is what you did to me but Joseph is a
[2:05:04] perfect type of
[2:05:06] Christ Joseph
[2:05:11] Perfection Joseph's greatest
[2:05:14] [Music]
[2:05:15] act in the whole time of his Reign was
[2:05:19] forgiving his brethren
[2:05:22] that's the greatest
[2:05:24] act and I thank God that he gives us
[2:05:28] example after
[2:05:31] example of learning to forgive thank you
[2:05:34] Lord so I say this to all of you this
[2:05:37] morning as the Lord had put this on my
[2:05:40] heart and I didn't speak this because
