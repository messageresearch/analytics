they were praying for him we want to keep continually praying for baronia bringing Josiah in your presence as well father and my pastor's daughter that needs healing touching her Alliance as well many other needs in the land of God we cannot name them all but you know them all of Jesus may you come in Minnesota's Souls of Father may you drive off all them belief and give us strength and Faith to believe in Word in Jesus name we pray amen we greet you all in lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ as we remain standing to read a word again uh thank you musician for your time and your dedication to serve the Lord shall we read in Psalms 91 it's going to be a long reading he that dwelleth we start the first one until verse 12. he that dwelleth in the sacred place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the follower Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou Trust his truth shall be thy shield and Buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror of that by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that worketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thy nice shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation they shall no evil before thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in the hands lest thou Dash thy foot against a stone let's go in Psalm 34 verse 7. just a short one the angel of the Lord encampeth around encampath around about them that fear Him and delivereth them may God add the blessings to the reading of Israel as you have your seats again I want to thank the pastor for allowing me to have this time to stand in the front of the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ here we are again to talk about the Lord and when we talk about him he always draws an eye he said well two or three are gathering in my name there I am in the midst of them and we believe that he's here I felt going in different direction but uh something was kept pulling me down bringing me back to the same subject that I spoke last two services it's Angelic Realm and the ministry of angels this is going to be part three and it has a subtitle it's going to be align me with my theophany that's what we're here for to be aligned with our theophany to come here to receive instructions on how to walk with the Lord for the Amnesia spiritual nature to be taken away remember Jesus Christ when he started his ministry here on Earth after being tempted by the devil in the wilderness because the Bible says the spirit after he was filled with the Holy Spirit he was laid into the wilderness where he was tempted by the enemy and after the Temptation the Bible says the angels come to him to minister to him to restore his strength if him as the Lord the angel had to minister to him how much more us after we've been through the weekend all kind of Temptations and all kind of dangers and all kind of stuff that the enemy has put on our ways we surely need to be in the presence of the Lord to be encouraged by the Angels behind the pulpit because the prophet of God says when your pastor is behind the pulpit is an angel of the Lord for you we're here to be encouraged ministering of angels we didn't start today it started in the Old Testament in New Testament and until today with the new of the message of William Branham we have seen ministering of angels a human being as a human beings we are living in the three realms if I can go back to that we have humanistic Realm the realm of faith in the realm of visions the regular human being out there the living human istic realm and the goal with whatever the bodies or the is telling them to do the flesh it's hard I can take off my shape my shirt I can take off my top I can be topless but you and I cannot do such a thing because we have the Holy Spirit that will restrain us from doing anything we have the realm of faith that's the spiritual in the Supernatural Realm and we have also the realm of visions and to get to the second realm we need to be a believer we need to have a Holy Spirit and what about them says when a Believer receives the Holy Spirit he becomes the two being two-fold being I mean to say one here to live and to die and the one inside to live eternally and angels come to minister to him you know God sometimes uh because he knows us more than we do ourselves he knows how to talk to us some people he comes by at night time during the dream some people he sent an angel literally like this to talk to them because he knows us it's like the Prophet Elijah a whole Ministry have influenced it the two simple people one that was a farmer and the other one was just a woman a wider woman they were influenced by the ministry of Elijah the prophet this ministry kind of took them from the humanistic realm to the realm of angels where they start seeing things like Elisha after Elijah departed from the scene Elisha went through all kind of visitation of angels I remember one time his servant gehazi when the philistine encompassed them his servant was just crying and agitated on all kinds of ways because Elisha was living in that realm because his servant was still in the humanistic Realm but Elisha being in the Vision in the realm of angels of the realm of faith she was column in tranquil he couldn't panic because he was seeing something that gehazi would not be able to see when he has was looking at the Philistines but Elisha was looking at the angels because the Bible says the angel of the Lord encompassed but Abraham says they don't leave they are there and they are commissioned to take care of you from your birth until your death it's a one thing to talk about the angels to preach about this ministering of angels but it's another thing to experience that I remember one day I was in uh Tempe I was driving and was trying to make a turn but end up going to the gas station QT as I was pulling in I hate birdly my uh one of my uh Tire I thought maybe I damaged the rims as I pulled over and then parked I was talking to myself I was like let me check is it the room okay no the room was okay but I looked I heard some F I was like oh my tire is going flat and I was talking to myself I said okay I have everything I'll take care of that is I open the trunk boom open and see the spare tire was there and I didn't have my Jack I didn't have any range because I took them put them in my main event because I've been traveling back and forth going to see my niece in New Mexico I was like okay Freddie what are you gonna do now I looked to my right side that was a small car Mazda 3. I believe it was if I'm not mistaken with dust covering that car and I look inside was a man sitting there bearded and I looked at him I was like should I start with him or start question some other people if they have a Jack to help me as soon as I got there sir would you yeah yeah yes I didn't even finish my sentence and went to the back of his trunk and he has a Jack he never uses that he didn't even know how to pull it out I helped him and I took it and he came over helped me on all kind of with all kind of things and grabbing a bolted I was like wow and after that I was like you talked about it something was telling me amen you talked about angels he didn't question he didn't he was he seems like was ready and my mind went back in the Bible to where Abraham took Isaac to sacrifice and when God saw his obedience he said no stop he looked to his side that was a lamb that was exactly what happened to me and Lucas said it was the guy was like did he come from heaven or something because he was looking at me it was ready to help so we need to be aware of angels they are there to take care of us in many ways they give us strength they encourage us when we're going through hard times remember Joshua when he was going through her time when Moses left the Saint the scene the angel of the Lord came up to him to encourage him view of good courage you're the one to take these people in the Promised Land because you know the devil is there first to jump on the occasion to start discouraging people yes and the Lord came to encourage Joshua they are there to deliver us whenever we have a hard time we are we don't know which way to go the children of Israel the Hebrews the three Hebrews children ago they were there they took decision to not serve the god of Babylon they say no we're not going to bow regardless of the conditional we're going to put you in the fight send us in the fire the angel the Fourth Man Came Down to deliver them the children of Israel they were like going into the Promised Land they've been Guided by the angel the almighty God himself in the pillow fire guiding them when Pharaoh's Army was approaching coming try to destroy them that angel stood between Pharaoh's Army and Israel in front of them he was guiding them behind them protected them and it was a provider in the midst I believe that's the case with us also as we're going through this journey the angel protects they protect us they guide us they give us strategies how to fight where to fight and when to fight they walk with us every day because in the in the message influence preached in 1963 March I think I believe was March the 8th he said this you see we've got to be conscious of God's presence this little five senses that we are living in that's just a little world of our own see but God that we was only given these so we could contact our Earthly home but there are senses beyond that another dimension and God is always present if we could only remember that the angels of the Lord are encamped about those who fear Him in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ in this building tonight is hosts of angels thousands of them gathered around you don't see them but you can feel the influence of them telling you that they are here if that isn't the if that isn't so endangered scriptures isn't so and if the scriptures isn't right then God isn't right the Bible says that the angels of God are encamped they don't leave they stay near those that fear Him Jesus said wherever two or three are gathering in my name I'll be in the midst then that makes him in a world that we cannot see that's our five senses doesn't contact Jesus Christ is here present if we could be conscious of that and remember this is what I want to say remember not only here but when you are walking down the street whatever you are you that profess to be Believers and feel the Lord remember the angels of God are moving with you sorry they watch everything you do every thought that goes through your mind and they know all about you therefore we must be conscious of that if we are not conscious of it then you act in any way so people mostly today too many people are not conscious of the presence of the Lord Jesus that's the reason they have these things we have going on now this that's not right if you could only do like David said I put the lord always before me oh I like that the lord always before me where he goes I'll follow and I'm conscious that everywhere I'm going in other words in other words David said that the Lord is going before me I will not leave thee nor forsake thee say Jesus lo I am with you always even to the end of the world he cannot leave us he promised it not to see we're not conscious of the presence of God and the angels one guy questioned me one day are you Christians I say I am Christian how do you keep your faith how do you stay you know not going to and fro and you know today you are Christian and tomorrow you are you're falling I said like what about him says here I keep Jesus I keep the Lord I put him in front of me all the time and I told him this is what I might tell the young people those those that need to be baptized you know when Jesus before he died and he rose again everybody could see him Believers and non-believers but after his death and his resurrections he was only appearing to the Believers if you truly have died with Christ and have resurrected with him you should only appear to the Believers that's one thing to keep your faith you need to change your environment I don't want to go ahead of myself because when you're not conscious of the presence of God you will act in all kinds of ways but if you are conscious of his presence you will act accordingly the message we believe in from the birth of the prophet of this end time until he's living off of the scene was full of visitation of angels from his birth in 1909 April the 6th the Angels Came into the little old cabin like he said and when he was seven years old he made Angels when he was going to pack water an angel talked to him do not smoke do not drink or do any defy or any you know don't Define your body because I would have work to do with you the same is he appeared to Mary when he got older the medium told him that he was born under the sign there was a constellation of stars when he was born and he she said whenever they lined up like that there's something some big event to take place on the Earth exactly like when Jesus was born three stars lined up there was a constellation of the Stars and they appeared to the uh Shepherd the major eyes laid them guiding them to where the king was born when the Bible says a certain point that those Stars disappeared in the Shepherds they kind of got lost in the end up being in erode area the mingle of the politicians and the wasted the time over there I wonder that's the same condition that is that most Ministers of the message today they are in sometimes they get lost they can track the the Stars they can follow the prophet they came keep tracking the the Stars they get mingled into the politics and things of the world no wonder we see the world in the church because they are lost and I don't know how long they're going to be lost in being mingled of the things of the world they need to go back to the star and follow it because this star which is the prophet William Branham he didn't come here to speak all of his of his ministry of himself but he came here to take us to the Lord Jesus Christ because his ministry had to be exactly reflecting the ministry of Jesus Christ so when those Stars got into constellation which means there was a Ministry to be born the ministry that has to reflect exactly the meaning of Jesus Christ no wonder people get confused and start taking him as Jesus Christ himself because he was aware of his ministry or and of the presence of the Lord he told them I'm Not Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ here on Earth he said when the Holy Spirit Will Come he will take he will teach you all things he will bring to your remembrance everything that I've preached or taught you even more if you see William Branham his ministry if you read it of close attention you will see it's exactly the minutes of Jesus Christ whether you take the uh teaching on demons he taught us about demonology he even went down into the details Jesus Christ preached about the Dimensions when he spoke about the uh Young Rich ruler but the prophet in this end time went into the details you can go on and on and on and on it's exactly the ministry of Jesus Christ no wonder they consider him as Jesus because when remember when the Capstone had to come to cup off the pyramid the part that has to meet with the Capstone has exact has to be exact has to fit in it doesn't have to be bigger or smaller he has to has to be exact the he has to fit with this in mind if you see every single time the angel appears whether it's in the old or the New Testament especially to the women it's linked to the birth of a child let's read in uh the Book of Judges there's so many things to go through here for many informations let's read Judges chapter 13. from verse 1 to verse 6 we can go all done but let's read until verse 6. and the children of Israel let's start with so let's start with verse two not one and there was a certain main of Zora of the family of the danits whose name was Manoa and his wife was barren and bear not and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art barren embarrassed not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore be aware pray thee and drink not wine no strong strong drink or eat not any unclean thing for Lo thou shall conceive and bear a son a known razor shall come on his head for the child shall be Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the philistine then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of God came unto me and his countenance was like a continent the continents of an angel of God very terrible but ask him not once he was neither told he me his name we're in the Bible here this child that was to be born has to deliver Israel when he got older but when the angel appeared to the woman he gave her the instruction or the exact diet for this child to be born in Nice condition because this child was to be Nazarite from the womb of his mom and this child was the one to deliver Israel in the New Testament the angel appeared to Elizabeth announcing the birth of John the Baptist exactly the same diet here when the angel appeared to William Branham was exactly the right the same diet guess what in this end time not only we have received the seventh angel but it was another Mighty angel that has come down and through the ministry of ulambranum this Angel gave us the diet of how to behave in order to birth Jesus Christ in the mange of our heart because the same Jesus that would be born in our hearts is the same one that will Deliver Us from all things starting with our own being because the first enemy that William Branham has is William Branham so this Angel has come down with exact information he didn't come with a simple message but he came down with an open book not a closer book because remember one time in the Bible there was a minister to whom Jesus handed a closet book after he read it in the temple remember that but in this end time we have received the angel the mighty angel of open book he handed it to Earthly angel and this is The Book of Life and this book will tell you where you came from where you going Who You Are how to overcome how to behave we can track the trip of this book this is the title deed that gives you the power to have dominion on the Earth and it's for a human being which we are this book was in the hands of God after he gave it to Adam because the book for is for the man he gave it to Adam a certain point in the beginning in God of Eden and for some reason the devil got that book and says he's dirty hand could not keep that book went back in the hands of God until in this end time where the mighty Angel has descended with this open book so from the hands of God to the human being the devil tried to take it God got it back and when there was no man to claim or to take that book in the hands of the Lamb remember John cried because there's nobody worthy to touch even to look at the book John cried why did he cry because when he was here on the Earth Jesus told them don't be happy don't Rejoice because of the Demons were subject unto you but be happy because your names are written in the book of life because if there was nobody to claim you to take that book the whole Humanity will have been lost now this book opened was handed to the prophet of this end time he didn't keep well eat with him from God to him human being to Adam he went back to God and came down the a mighty Angel took it which is Jesus Christ the lamb and he's bringing it down to hand it back to the human being so the final destination of this book has to be in US and this book it's Jesus Christ himself we have received exactly the angel in the same way manoa's wife received angel Mary received the angel Sarah in Old Testament received angel and all those visitations was linked to the birth of a special child and this angel coming down here is for the birth of the special child which is Jesus Christ in the mange of your heart all the instructions has been given to us of how to behave the special diet because we are in a heavenly vision remember in uh John 5 when Jesus went to uh went to the the pool of Bethesda the Bible says at a certain point all people of all kind of uh health conditions gathered around the pool the Bible says at a certain point an angel would be saying in Troubled Water whoever will jump your need first will get healed at a certain moment an angel will come down trouble the world whoever jumped in the water remember the water talks about the word so we had an angel First Age second age until the seventh one so this time when everybody was expecting a name for an angel to come in trouble the water they saw Jesus coming I was the mighty angel when he came he was skipping people he didn't mean to skip them because he was coming with a vision because he said the son doesn't do anything unless the father shows him what to do so he had the vision heavenly vision he was skipping people even though they had condition that need his attention but he was skipping them speak skipping that one go to Jonathan skipping this one go to Barron and in this end time the same Angel has come down not everybody have received a message they have conditions that need his attention but he was keeping them and coming to you and I so the very son which is Jesus Christ that we need to conceive like I said they need a special attention special diet that's what I'm says let me see in your room in your office what do you have as a magazine as a newspaper what is hanging on your wall who are you mingling with those are the diet because the the world we are living in especially in this end time there's too many things happening the end time message is feeding the end time conditions I met one guy who was telling me about his daughter he told me first about his health condition he said the doctor gave him few days to leave you on the Earth and he preferred to be with his mom he brought his little child she's UH 60 she was uh she's six years old he told me something shocked him because one day his daughter coming from school she was telling him dad you know I don't even know which gender I am and he said shut your mouth I cut you umbilical cord I know exactly what gender you are so with all of these conditions with all these pressures naked women and all of this it's not for people on in the world it's for us so if you don't have Jesus Christ in your heart the son that will deliver you from all the Temptation from all the conditions you're gonna fall Manoa wanted to see the angel too if you go read the whole chapter you will see that and when I was uh searching and reading and listening to Barbara messages and but a billboard wanted to see the angel too but I'm talked about the Angels so much that he wanted to see the angel I was like this is the Bible because Manoa the angel appeared to his wife and he went to ask the Lord can you send back that angel that man again to teach us how to take care of this child and God heard his prayer same did God hear the prayer of uh Billy Paul and he was uh you can go on YouTube and you see how he's uh giving is that testimony I was like wow we are in the Bible God answered his prayer so taking this book in our heart reading this book going through it it gives us because this is the title deed as I said earlier so title that is that is giving us the power to have dominion on the Earth and this will allow us to be aligned with our theophany remember brother Barnum was what he was doing he was just aligning himself with his theophany because one day he had conversation with his wife she said honey you are going bald headed you say no I haven't lost my hair and say no tell me where they are because you don't have anything no you tell me where the word before I got them and I'll tell you well they are waiting for me which means he was aligning himself with his theophany two or three years after that he has he had a vision he himself had a hard time to consider it as a vision was it a real life or what was it in things that are to be but the bottom says this but that morning when I felt something come over me and I thought usually like a vision comes and I looked and I looked and I thought my what is this and I looked at Great green Hills and young woman just coming from everywhere by the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands and they were all coming long hair hanging down their back white robes on barefooted you that are arguing about dressing because this was in heaven don't argue so if you want to go to heaven see how to address long robe barefooted no I don't want you to be working barefooted in the world coming long hair hanging down their back white robes on barefooted screaming hollering our brother I thought now this is strange and I turned back around and I looked and there I laid right there and there was my wife laying there on the bed and I said now you know what I died I say that's what happened I've died and I said I might have had a heart attack or something I've died there lays my body I was just laying there with my hands back like that just as stiff I thought well that's not 20 feet from me see you have two men here you have a man born of a woman in a man one of a man let's continue and there I was looking I thought there is my wife there is everything there was my shirt hanging there on that bed post and I thought here here I am I looked around again and these women were all coming and they were and I looked coming this way and they come my brothers all genuine all of them look to be young man they were screaming our precious brother why I didn't know what to think I thought this this is strange I looked back and I was an old man I was young and I thought this is strange thing I thought is is this a vision I'd bite my finger I thought no I ain't that kind of vision I've had and then there's something begin to talk to me up and said you've entered in your people and I thought with with my people are all these brenhams and he said they are your comfort to Christ and these women and you know I've always been considered kind of they call me women hater you see the prophet all his life he was aligning himself or tuning himself with his theophany until to these days and he said he could look back there and see himself just laying back with hands like this this man born of a woman didn't have any clue of what was going on but the main one of a man was young he could see the other side he could see this side of curtain of time which means this body is nothing didn't have any clue just laying back there old head bold full of fear but this one was young strong that's why we're here to be taught to receive instructions of how to take off the spiritual amnesia the more we talk about the Lord the more we read the message the spiritual nature is going away we are tuning lining up with our theophany because that's what we're heading we don't want to keep talking Earthly we need to talk heavenly and to get to that it takes God himself to be with us and he told us lo I will be with you even in you until the end of the time he gave instructions to the angels to take care of us from birth until death not only that but he himself is an angel creator because remember those angels creation an angel Creator himself he said Lord I'll be with you even in you until the end of the time what a consolation not only to be with us but the most sacred part of a human being is a heart is a soul that's where he is dwelling but now he he gave charge to Angel to protect you do not really protect this body but they're protecting God that is in you the Throne of your heart because we have three Thrones the first Throne was Heaven the second one in Jesus Christ like Barbara says and the third one is a human being believers if there's no God in your heart they can come what are they protecting unbelief no because when God does in your heart you believe because the Bible says without faith you cannot even please God you're unbelievable send the Angels away but your faith will draw them close to you with this book open we know who we are where we come from and where we're going and I remember one time in the Bible God was questioning job he questioned him because something was going through his life he was afraid of his children he was giving offering and praying and because maybe they have they might have done something I need to pray for them I need to consecrate or to you know bring them into the the Lord presence through the prayers and sacrifices and things the very thing he was afraid of happened to him be careful the very thing you're afraid of might happen to you therefore cast The Fear away and he started cursing the days of his birth and things and God came down he's like who's this man that is darkening the counsel of God by words without knowledge and I'm gonna ask you questions where were you when I was laying the foundation of this world brothers and sisters today we have the answer we cannot be speechless like uh job because the book is open because we have the book with us we know where we come from we know we know where we're going and we know why we are here on this Earth we can be speechless we can tell him we're in your mind too many questions he said can you bind the sweet influence of the Pleiades and the plead is you know there are seven stars and because it's Seven Sisters feel that sweet influence when you listen to the message all right the same influence that cleopas and his friend was under they felt the heart was burning when Jesus was talking to them when you come to church when you read the Bible when you read the message you need to feel the same influence even Jesus Christ when he was preaching here on the Earth in the temple the Jews that was like questioning themselves whose kind of man is this he's commelling the demons and they are living sometimes God can provoke the devil because he's trusting you that's why he was questioning job what kind of man is this darkening the counsel of God sometimes God can trust you so much that he can provoke the devil have you seen my servant devil job so sometimes you need to be careful you see a situation going you're going through a situation don't have to Panic or just behave in misbehaving in all kinds of ways be careful might be your father who's provoking the devil because he's trusting you more you know one day he was preached by Adam God was preached well I mean Adam was preaching God remember in the Bible in the in Genesis she brought all the creatures in front of Adam see how he's going to name them this is a lion God was saying amen this is an ego amen because he knew Adam has the revelation of what was the name of that creature until he brought his wife to him now this is the bone of my bones who told him he had the Revelation and God was saying Amen to the preaching of Adam I remember one brother was telling me sometimes he was going he was married back then he was uh telling me because I wasn't married back then when I was in the Congo um he was like my wife she's giving me her time I wonder is is this the my uh rib or this is a chicken bones or because she's giving me her time maybe it's a chicken bone that cannot fit here so this book has everything we have need of for this journey we are going we have the special diet for Christ that we need to observe because the angel like uh Manoa and his wife they needed the angel to tell them how to what kind of diet and how to behave how to take care of this child the seventh messenger the seventh angel has given us the diet it's unto us to go through this diet and see what we need to do because he has to be born in the mange of our heart he's the very one to deliver us coming back to uh lithiumphony in the Old Testament they used to call the angel until when we got William Branham is a messenger he explained to us what it was they back then they called it angel even Jesus Christ himself in Matthew 18 10. yes we did in Matthew 18 chapter 18 verse 10 he says take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven the angels do always behold the father I mean the face of my father which is in heaven taught us this is our theophany he said you can feel the influence of them that's why you have the sweet feel the sweet influence he said they are bumping into you theophany how can we line up without theophany if we don't receive Christ in our heart so these teachings now nowadays you see many message churches they don't go through them as I say is that like the ministers they are maybe lost in the politics and things of this world because this message that has come to us is a Urgent Message is to take us home these are the things we need to insist because there's a philosopher who said the man does it mean humankind does evil things because he doesn't know good things because if he knows good things he will necessarily do them that's why we are repeating bringing to your remembrance these teachings of theophanese of heavenly homes trying to project the very picture of you the Divine picture of yourself by the preacher of the word and when a human especially the Believers will necessarily know who they are while they are here where they are going they will surely act accordingly I like the way you are aiming if it's not English you are amen amen I remember the other day what Iran mentioned something about sister Vicky I don't know we've seen the Vicky here you are true Nightingale a nightingale and we have a lot of Nightingales here don't get me wrong you know what it is right what about them talked about Nightingales and he said he made a studies on The Nightingales he said they are during the night time when the star is shining they'll just stick their head up and uh the other detail is that they are zeroing in to look at the star that's how they are singing which means god is somewhere so if you are sleeping you cannot say Amen because you need to zero in on the star that is shining all right let's turn to our feet show about our heads at the same time father even though we spoke in picking wood here and there and but I know you have said something that will be an encouragement for your children tonight I believe the holy spirit will take and repeat and cause them to be pondering on these words and to even dive and go deep into the world to be blessed again this world is passing away we have received a message that is telling us where we come from and where we're going and how to be prepared for the rapture father help us the battle is heavy [Music] we see all kind of things taking place in this end time but as your Prophet said the end time condition has a message that will fit we cannot face these battles without you that's why we are inviting you God to come in our lives and to give us an encouragement to cause us to be pondering and meditating on these words of father [Music] I commit each and every one of us tonight in your hands as we'll be departing from this place but not from your presence expecting you to bring us back again to be taught by you to be given instructions of how to behave in this wicked world bless each and every one of us as we commit the rest of the surface in your hands in Jesus name
