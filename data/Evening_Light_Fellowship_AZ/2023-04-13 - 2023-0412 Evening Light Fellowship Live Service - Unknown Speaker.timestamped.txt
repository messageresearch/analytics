[41:28] and verse 19.
[41:31] he shall keep my statutes
[41:35] Thou shalt not let thy candle cattle
[41:39] um gender with a diverse kind
[41:43] Thou shalt not sow thy field with
[41:46] mingled seed
[41:48] neither shall a garment
[41:51] mingled of linen and Woolen come upon
[41:54] you I want you to notice
[41:56] Thou shalt not sow thy feed thy field
[41:59] with mingled seed
[42:03] Deuteronomy
[42:05] chapter 22 and verse 9.
[42:09] Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with
[42:12] diverse seeds
[42:14] lest the fruit of thy seed which thou
[42:17] has sown
[42:19] and the fruit of thy Vineyard be defiled
[42:24] now turn with me to the Book of Matthew
[42:27] chapter 13.
[42:31] and verses 24 through 30.
[42:37] another Parable put he forth unto them
[42:39] saying the kingdom of heaven
[42:42] is likened unto a man which sowed good
[42:45] seed in his field
[42:48] and while men slept his enemy came and
[42:50] sowed tears among the wheat
[42:53] and went his way
[42:55] but when the blade was sprung up and
[42:57] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[42:59] tears also
[43:01] the Servants of the householder came and
[43:04] said unto him
[43:05] sir did thou not so good seed in thy
[43:10] field and from whence
[43:12] then half of Tears
[43:14] and he said unto them an enemy hath done
[43:18] this
[43:19] the servant said unto him
[43:22] well thou then that we go and gather
[43:24] them up
[43:25] but he said nay lest while you gather up
[43:28] the tears you root up also the wheat
[43:31] with them
[43:32] let them grow together until the Harvest
[43:36] and in the time of harvest I will say to
[43:38] the Reapers Gather ye together first the
[43:41] tears
[43:42] and bind them in bundles and burn them
[43:45] but gather the wheat into my barn
[43:49] may God add the blessing the reading of
[43:52] his word you all may be seated tonight
[43:54] in his presence amen
[43:59] amen I would like to take for a short
[44:01] while this evening is what God has been
[44:04] dealing with me on is about I'd like to
[44:06] title this sermon
[44:08] maybe a little bit unusual and just hang
[44:10] on with me as a
[44:12] um as I lay the foundation for this this
[44:15] evening
[44:16] circumcising this message
[44:19] under the seventh seal
[44:22] and I would like to take a subject of
[44:25] the Bride field
[44:29] is to receive the bridegroom seed
[44:34] Now understand
[44:37] that we know that biologically a man is
[44:40] a giver of seed
[44:42] biologically a woman is a receiver of
[44:46] seed
[44:48] and whatever is sown into the woman she
[44:51] takes it and she multiplies it
[44:53] and we know that according to God's law
[44:56] in Genesis 1 11
[44:58] that every seed will bring forth of its
[45:01] own kind
[45:03] the prophet of God said if you plant
[45:05] corn you will not get wheat
[45:07] he said if you plant a watermelon you
[45:10] will not get a grapefruit
[45:12] those are things that are under God's
[45:16] law and I want you to understand that
[45:18] there is a law within every seed
[45:23] it just has to be planted
[45:26] and watered and you will not know that
[45:30] seed of what it is until it begins to
[45:33] get fruit
[45:34] and by its fruit you'll know it
[45:38] now we know that everything works
[45:39] according to God's law and according to
[45:42] his season
[45:43] and we know and we recognize that the
[45:47] Rapture of the church and the Harvest is
[45:50] soon to come we know that we can see the
[45:53] flashing red lights of the signs of his
[45:56] coming
[45:57] saints of God he's coming and he's
[45:59] coming soon he's shown it in the signs
[46:02] in the heavens he's shown it here on
[46:04] Earth he's had his Prophet come and
[46:06] reveal to us the word of God we have no
[46:09] excuse
[46:10] we've all got to be ready and if you
[46:13] miss it it's because you missed it
[46:17] because the bride has made
[46:21] herself ready
[46:26] then we realize that the seed has got to
[46:28] be planted in the right kind of ground
[46:33] it has to be in the bedding ground of
[46:34] faith
[46:36] not a non-believer end doubt not in
[46:39] immaturity of mind
[46:42] not some kind of theological betting
[46:45] ground of carnal intellect
[46:48] the Apostle Paul says how do you want me
[46:50] to come to you
[46:51] with intellectual words of man's Wisdom
[46:54] or with power and demonstration
[46:57] God help us
[46:59] that we go beyond our carnal
[47:01] understanding and come into a spiritual
[47:05] understanding of God's word because the
[47:07] Bible says that to be carnally minded is
[47:10] eminently with God and neither can it
[47:13] know the things of God
[47:15] how can you explain explain to people
[47:18] spiritual things if they don't have a
[47:21] basis of Christianity
[47:24] you must be born again in order to
[47:26] understand the kingdom of God
[47:32] the rapture
[47:34] is not just the catching away
[47:37] it's not just an event
[47:42] I want you to understand that the
[47:44] resurrection
[47:46] is a person
[47:48] Jesus said
[47:50] I am the resurrection when he talked to
[47:53] Mary and Martha about their brother
[47:55] Lazarus and they he said that talk to
[47:59] him about the resurrection she said yes
[48:01] I know my brother will come up in the
[48:03] resurrection
[48:05] and Jesus said those powerful wonderful
[48:09] words of I am the resurrection and I am
[48:12] the life and he that believeth in me how
[48:15] many of you believe tonight listen you
[48:19] can't make yourself believe either God
[48:22] put it in there for you to believe
[48:25] or you don't have it
[48:27] right there's something that is inside
[48:29] every seed that causes them when they
[48:33] hear the word of God to say yea and amen
[48:37] even if they don't understand it
[48:43] so the Rapture is just not an event it's
[48:46] a person
[48:49] for Jesus is the resurrection and he is
[48:53] the line
[48:54] now brother Brennan in the sermon what
[48:56] is the Holy Ghost he picks us up because
[48:59] that God made a covenant with Abraham
[49:01] after he'd called Abraham which is a
[49:04] type of calling the believer today I
[49:06] want all of you to identify with this
[49:09] he called Abraham Abraham moved out of
[49:11] his country went into a Strange Land to
[49:14] dwell among strange people and that was
[49:16] the type of when God calls a man to stop
[49:20] his meanness repent of his sins and he
[49:24] turns then from the crowd that he was in
[49:26] to live in a new crowd among new types
[49:29] of people
[49:32] then after God found Abraham to be
[49:34] faithful to the promises that God gave
[49:37] him
[49:38] he that would have a child and through
[49:40] this child all the Earth would be
[49:42] blessed then God confirmed his faith by
[49:45] giving him a sign
[49:47] and that sign was circumcision and
[49:50] circumcision is a type of the Holy
[49:53] Spirit
[49:55] my brother my sister rapturing Faith is
[49:57] laying in those messages
[49:59] but it's not just hearing a tape that
[50:03] causes you to understand it's not just
[50:06] reading a message book that causes you
[50:09] to understand you've got to have the
[50:11] Holy Spirit because the holy spirit is
[50:13] the Divine revealer of God's word
[50:17] amen
[50:22] but rapturing faith will not become
[50:25] mature
[50:27] until the promises of the hour
[50:31] are embraced by a mature virgin mind of
[50:35] the Bride of this hour
[50:38] it's got to be the right field
[50:42] it's got to be a seasoned field a
[50:46] prepared field
[50:49] I remember the Song of Solomon hell that
[50:52] he said those poetic words
[50:55] oh my spouse my garden
[50:58] how that I want to come unto thee early
[51:01] in the morning
[51:03] how that I want to plant my seed and he
[51:07] goes on and on and it's not just a
[51:09] metaphor about a uh a garden but it's a
[51:13] metaphor about God and his church even
[51:16] when Paul said I show you a greater
[51:20] mystery than just a man and woman I want
[51:23] to show you a mystery between Christ and
[51:25] his church
[51:29] in the resume of the ages brother
[51:31] Brenham says
[51:34] there then must come upon the scene in
[51:37] this age those who will bring the wheat
[51:39] and tears to maturity
[51:43] the tares are already maturing very fast
[51:45] under corrupt teachers
[51:48] somebody say Amen
[51:51] all you got to do is look around you and
[51:53] see the corrupt teachers
[51:56] they're in the politics they're in the
[51:58] schools they're everywhere they're on
[52:00] YouTube and all of them
[52:03] are trying to turn the people from the
[52:06] word
[52:07] in fact the Bible says all those
[52:10] whose names are not written in the
[52:12] Lamb's Book of Life shall be deceived
[52:17] so we find out when you look at this and
[52:20] who would have ever thought that America
[52:23] would change so rapidly as what we've
[52:26] seen in the last few years
[52:28] I mean where are the common people with
[52:30] common sense
[52:33] in fact when you look and you see the
[52:36] radical
[52:37] things that are going in and people
[52:40] don't know their gender they they they
[52:42] have no moral compass homes are
[52:46] destroyed schools are destroyed there
[52:49] are the home life and everything is just
[52:52] being torn down why is it because
[52:54] corrupt teachers are trying to take the
[52:57] people away from the word God help us
[53:00] give us Ministry that'll preach the word
[53:03] to the people and bring them back to
[53:05] God's healing line
[53:09] I don't want to go to a church it's just
[53:11] a few good church
[53:13] tell everybody we're all gone because
[53:15] not everybody's going
[53:17] only a word living bride listen do not
[53:20] cheapen the token of God
[53:24] do not bring the standard of God's word
[53:27] down to the people you want to raise the
[53:30] people up to God's standards because if
[53:33] you ever lower a standard you'll never
[53:35] get it back
[53:40] so he says the Terrors are already
[53:42] maturing very fast
[53:45] under corrupt teachers who turn the
[53:47] people from the word but the weed also
[53:49] must mature
[53:51] and to her God is sending the prophet
[53:53] somebody say Amen it was sent to you why
[53:57] to mature you messenger with a
[54:00] Vindicated Ministry that he might be
[54:02] accepted by the elect
[54:06] they will hear him as the first church
[54:08] hurt Paul
[54:10] and she will mature in the word until
[54:13] becoming a wordbride
[54:15] the mighty Works will be found in her
[54:17] that are always attended upon the pure
[54:20] word and faith
[54:22] now as much as we don't like to see
[54:24] what's happening even in America in our
[54:27] schools in our governments
[54:30] we've got to realize that all of this
[54:33] has got to come to pass
[54:35] so that we see that they will become
[54:40] mature under their corrupt teachers
[54:44] now let me tell you there it seems to me
[54:47] that they are becoming very very mature
[54:50] right now in their corruption
[54:53] so what does that tell us about you and
[54:55] I
[54:56] if they're maturing what about you and I
[54:59] we should be maturing to a far greater
[55:01] level than where we're at God help us to
[55:05] rise to the place where God wants us to
[55:08] be
[55:12] turning the minds of the people the
[55:14] Bible says that they would be believe a
[55:16] lie and be damned
[55:20] in the sermon to show us the father now
[55:22] father help us tonight and open the word
[55:24] to us
[55:25] open our understanding
[55:28] circumcise the lips of your servant
[55:32] that speaks and circumcised the hearts
[55:34] of the people that the word may fall in
[55:37] that it may fall in Rich
[55:40] fertile ground and bring forth a hundred
[55:43] fold
[55:44] and may there not be a feeble one Among
[55:47] Us after tonight may it be over tonight
[55:50] everyone with faith father granted now
[55:53] may the Holy Spirit take the things of
[55:55] God and deliver them right out to the
[55:57] people for we ask it in Jesus the name
[56:00] of the son of God Jesus Christ
[56:03] Now understand he says God circumcised
[56:06] my lips but circumcised the hearts of
[56:09] the people that they're that their their
[56:12] hearts would be ready to receive the
[56:14] word with good fertile ground
[56:20] if you read your Bible I don't want you
[56:23] to read it as you read a book
[56:27] I want you to read it with understanding
[56:29] I would rather you read five verses
[56:34] and pray and seek God's understanding of
[56:37] those five verses then five chapters and
[56:40] you don't even remember what book you
[56:42] were in
[56:45] the Bible says with all of your getting
[56:47] get understanding
[56:52] amen
[56:54] so circumcision is a sign that was given
[56:58] to Abraham that God had received his
[57:00] faith understand then this principle
[57:04] that God gives the Revelation to the
[57:07] believer
[57:08] is that right God gives you revelation
[57:12] what should you be praying for
[57:14] revelation
[57:16] and so when you pray and God gives you
[57:19] revelation
[57:21] and then you understand it and you apply
[57:23] it to your life God cannot reject what
[57:27] he gave to you
[57:29] he cannot reject himself
[57:32] why if he was given you that revelation
[57:36] of how to please him that when you do it
[57:39] guess what he says that's righteousness
[57:43] I received that and when Abraham by
[57:46] faith believed God God said that's
[57:49] righteousness and it was imputed unto
[57:52] him
[57:54] amen
[57:57] everything that the believer does he
[57:59] does by faith
[58:02] in fact one of my favorite chapters
[58:05] in the Bible is Hebrews 11.
[58:08] and I remember as a young Christian and
[58:12] reading this this book of Hebrews one
[58:15] time with some real understanding and
[58:17] went across and faith is the substance
[58:19] of things so for any evidence of Things
[58:22] Not Seen and for by it faith
[58:25] the elders obtained a good report by
[58:28] faith Abraham by faith Noah by faith
[58:30] Jeremiah it just goes on and on and
[58:33] every one of the sentences almost uh
[58:35] verse by verse says and by faith
[58:38] and so understand that the very uh link
[58:41] between all of them on their servitude
[58:44] to God is faith
[58:47] and so you need to have faith in your
[58:50] life
[58:52] not education
[58:57] education
[58:58] only goes so far
[59:01] I've had young people and older people
[59:04] alike that have been raised up and know
[59:07] the precepts of this message
[59:10] they know the concepts they know about
[59:12] how that a woman should dress a man
[59:15] should dress how we should act in our
[59:17] lives but
[59:19] if you are not upon the solid rock of
[59:22] the revelation of Jesus Christ and when
[59:25] the the the things of Life Starts coming
[59:28] against you and the wind comes and the
[59:32] rain falls and great is the fall of it
[59:34] if it's not on the solid rock
[59:41] Enoch walked by faith and God took him
[59:45] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[59:48] unto him for righteousness
[59:52] I think
[59:54] I told you one time that when I went
[59:56] through the book of Hebrews there in
[59:58] Hebrews 11 and talked about
[1:00:01] Abraham and Sarah and when all the
[1:00:05] different ones and japheth and Samson
[1:00:07] and it named the different ones and if
[1:00:11] you ever take the time
[1:00:13] to study who they were and what they did
[1:00:17] you will think oh my
[1:00:20] look at Samson
[1:00:22] look at the failure that he was and yet
[1:00:26] he is recorded I want to let me just
[1:00:29] tell you the concept that I received
[1:00:31] when I read that
[1:00:35] the fact is at the end of the road and
[1:00:39] when we stand before God God's eulogy
[1:00:42] about you is different
[1:00:45] why he didn't see your mistakes
[1:00:49] why because they were under the blood
[1:00:52] our Crimson sins
[1:00:56] under the blood turn white
[1:00:58] and when we ask Christ to forgive us
[1:01:01] guess what you're forgiven as though you
[1:01:04] never did it
[1:01:06] now when I look at the life of Abraham
[1:01:08] and I see him stagger
[1:01:11] I see him going into Hagar I see him
[1:01:14] lying I see him giving his wife away to
[1:01:17] save his own neck
[1:01:19] I see him staggering but the Bible says
[1:01:22] he's staggered not at the promise of God
[1:01:24] through unbelief that's God's eulogy of
[1:01:27] Abraham how would you like to have God's
[1:01:30] eulogy be read about you and God says
[1:01:33] he's staggered not he was in laudiusia
[1:01:36] he never bowed to the god of fashion he
[1:01:39] never he huh Hallelujah he was faithful
[1:01:42] unto death praise God
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:50] faith
[1:01:52] in the sermon Israel and the church
[1:01:55] he called Abraham by election
[1:01:58] he calls the church by election
[1:02:01] he gave Abraham the promise Abraham
[1:02:04] believed it and he calls the church
[1:02:05] today watch how he always says Abraham
[1:02:08] the church talks about Abraham elect how
[1:02:11] about the church you're elect he always
[1:02:13] brings you into the picture
[1:02:18] you believe Jesus Christ
[1:02:20] then the first you believe and then God
[1:02:22] hit Abraham and his children his seeds
[1:02:25] circumcised as a sign and he gives you
[1:02:28] the holy gaze the Holy Ghost today as a
[1:02:31] sign
[1:02:34] what is only goes to a human being when
[1:02:36] it comes
[1:02:37] to circumcise
[1:02:40] amen the Holy Ghost is a circumcision
[1:02:43] and what circumcision do cuts off
[1:02:46] Surplus flesh all the things of the
[1:02:49] world it circumcises you away from the
[1:02:51] things of the world the love of the
[1:02:54] world the love of the Flesh and the
[1:02:55] pride of life it just circumcises you
[1:02:58] from that you have nothing to do with it
[1:03:00] it does it itself
[1:03:03] and put you in love with Jesus Christ
[1:03:06] with undying love amen
[1:03:10] in the sermon power of transformation
[1:03:12] and that seed will take a hold somewhere
[1:03:15] glory to God the only thing he's looking
[1:03:17] for today is a betting ground
[1:03:22] somewhere that it can bid
[1:03:26] it started in Eve for her bed forth and
[1:03:29] bring forth Sons
[1:03:31] of God not Sons of Satan but she was a
[1:03:35] betting ground and it fell in the wrong
[1:03:38] place now remember my subject of the
[1:03:42] Bride
[1:03:43] field
[1:03:44] is for the bridegroom seed
[1:03:49] so she was a betting ground and fell in
[1:03:52] the wrong place so the word
[1:03:54] fall so will the word fall in an
[1:03:57] unbeliever or a doubter or a skeptic
[1:03:59] it'll make a church member out of them
[1:04:02] but never a son or daughter of God
[1:04:04] you tell them
[1:04:07] to let their hair grow they'll laugh in
[1:04:09] your face
[1:04:11] you tell them to do this or that and the
[1:04:13] man to do what they'll laugh in your
[1:04:15] face it's not sons of God it's the wrong
[1:04:19] betting ground yet they're holding the
[1:04:22] seed see the false anointed ones
[1:04:25] they're anointed yes with the Holy
[1:04:28] Spirit speak in tongues do signs and
[1:04:30] wonders but it's of Satan
[1:04:33] that is a powerful statement
[1:04:36] but we must have the bidding ground of
[1:04:38] faith
[1:04:40] it has to be mature to be able to
[1:04:43] receive
[1:04:45] rapturing seed
[1:04:51] Sarah could not bring forth
[1:04:54] the promise seed until she cast out all
[1:04:56] her unbelief do you remember the first
[1:04:58] time that she hears the angel
[1:05:02] and it says and your wife is going to
[1:05:04] bring forth a son and she laughed within
[1:05:08] her cell
[1:05:10] and God caught her laughing he said why
[1:05:13] did Sarah laughed and she denied it
[1:05:16] and what's an amazing thing is God could
[1:05:19] have and would have taken her life
[1:05:22] for lying to him to his face but he
[1:05:25] couldn't do it
[1:05:27] why
[1:05:29] because she was a part of Abraham
[1:05:32] and if he took her he would hurt Abraham
[1:05:36] and because she was a part of Abraham
[1:05:39] she was a part of Abraham's Covenant
[1:05:41] because he was she was under that same
[1:05:43] Covenant guess what she was under the
[1:05:46] same promises understand my brother my
[1:05:49] sister
[1:05:50] that when God calls the man he calls the
[1:05:52] wife Hallelujah
[1:05:56] now
[1:05:58] Sarah
[1:06:00] her unbelief would not allow her to
[1:06:03] embrace the promise that was given to
[1:06:06] her because her mind was so carnal at
[1:06:10] times that she was thinking how can
[1:06:12] these things be Mary said the same thing
[1:06:15] listen those people in the Bible are no
[1:06:18] different than you and I
[1:06:20] we tend to think oh my these people you
[1:06:23] know and Angels coming to them surely
[1:06:25] they were great Believers surely when
[1:06:27] they saw the the tomb was empty surely
[1:06:30] when they see you saw the grave close
[1:06:32] was there and there was no body surely
[1:06:35] when the tomb was open they would have
[1:06:37] all said Hallelujah he is risen they
[1:06:40] didn't they wandered within themselves
[1:06:43] so much of the time our mind keeps us
[1:06:46] from seeing what God is doing around us
[1:06:55] Jesus appeared many times and
[1:06:59] they thought he was a spirit
[1:07:02] of course you would too if he came
[1:07:04] walking on the water
[1:07:07] and they were afraid he said be not
[1:07:09] afraid it is I
[1:07:11] Lord if that be you
[1:07:14] then bid me to come
[1:07:17] Peter's a fisherman
[1:07:18] he's raised on the water
[1:07:20] Lord if that's really you bid me come
[1:07:22] Peter come
[1:07:24] you know I I like this let's brag about
[1:07:27] Peter for a moment he's the only one
[1:07:31] yeah yeah he began to sink yeah but you
[1:07:35] know what I want to praise him because
[1:07:37] Peter had courage enough to get out of
[1:07:40] the boat
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:45] I can just imagine once in a while Peter
[1:07:48] said they asked him what was it like was
[1:07:50] it soft or hard how did it feel to walk
[1:07:54] on water
[1:07:57] my brother my sisters too much of the
[1:07:59] time
[1:08:00] we stay in our boat and we're afraid to
[1:08:02] step out of our little comfort zone but
[1:08:05] you know what I believe that every
[1:08:07] exploit of faith that is ever going to
[1:08:09] be done by the Bride of Jesus Christ you
[1:08:12] are going to have to get out of your
[1:08:13] comfort zone who am I
[1:08:15] why should I speak to this who am I how
[1:08:18] can I I'm just a housewife I I you know
[1:08:22] I'm nobody special I'm not a preacher
[1:08:25] how can I pray over my own kids listen
[1:08:27] prop the prophet said every one of you
[1:08:30] have a commission when your kids are
[1:08:32] sick lay hands on them Kill Em God will
[1:08:36] heal them do those things you speak the
[1:08:39] word I love that fact to that one woman
[1:08:42] that failed to pray for the woman that
[1:08:44] had a child in the prayer line
[1:08:47] and the whole time she is denying it no
[1:08:50] Lord she's gonna go up before the
[1:08:52] prophet I don't need to go pray for that
[1:08:55] baby she had such compassion
[1:08:58] until finally she just couldn't hold it
[1:09:01] back any more and she have you ever had
[1:09:04] times like that where you just hey go do
[1:09:06] it go do it go do it and finally she
[1:09:09] went okay okay I'll do it she went up
[1:09:12] there and she said I'm so sorry excuse
[1:09:14] me I know you're in the prayer line and
[1:09:16] everything but do you mind if I pray for
[1:09:18] your little baby would you mind if I
[1:09:20] said a prayer oh no please pray now
[1:09:23] here's the amazing thing the mother
[1:09:25] brings the little child up is there
[1:09:27] before the prophet he lays his hands on
[1:09:30] the he says your child is already healed
[1:09:33] oh you know when your baby got healed
[1:09:36] when that sister failed to go pray for
[1:09:39] your baby God healed that baby Now
[1:09:43] understand what the principle here of
[1:09:45] what God is teaching us it doesn't have
[1:09:48] to be the minister it doesn't have to be
[1:09:50] anybody great you just have to be led of
[1:09:53] the spirit you have to be willing you
[1:09:55] have to be sensitized and the way to
[1:09:58] sensitize your spirit is by prayer
[1:10:02] and seeking the mind of God
[1:10:07] prayer softens your spirit
[1:10:10] so that you can hear him
[1:10:13] because he says still small voice
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:24] the bride is to lay in the presence of
[1:10:26] the Sun
[1:10:28] she used to lay there until all of the
[1:10:30] greenness and all the immaturity is to
[1:10:33] be taken out of her
[1:10:35] and so I want you just as the natural
[1:10:38] sunlight
[1:10:40] shines upon whether it be the wheat or
[1:10:43] the trees or whatever it brings
[1:10:46] everything to fruition
[1:10:48] and so it is with the bride the prophet
[1:10:51] of God said that little bride she's got
[1:10:53] to lay before the presence of the Sun
[1:10:56] and that sunlight is to take the
[1:10:59] greenness out of her
[1:11:01] and she's to be a mature
[1:11:04] brine amen if you want the right kind of
[1:11:08] harvest you got to run sow the right
[1:11:11] kind of seed understand this principle
[1:11:13] you'll never have a raptured church
[1:11:16] until you had a raptured teaching
[1:11:22] there's got to be raptured sermons
[1:11:24] Rapture sermons with rapturing faith
[1:11:27] in order to bring forth the raptured
[1:11:30] church
[1:11:32] amen
[1:11:36] if you're going to sow for the rapture
[1:11:39] has got to come a time when you start
[1:11:42] sowing rapturing Faith to the bride
[1:11:46] and understand that it couldn't be done
[1:11:48] or sown under the first pull
[1:11:51] because the first poll was just healing
[1:11:54] it was the outer core it's the flesh
[1:11:58] many were healed that never followed the
[1:12:00] Lord
[1:12:04] it couldn't be done under the second
[1:12:06] pool that's discernment that's the
[1:12:08] spirit that's the inner Court you had
[1:12:10] the outer Court inner Court
[1:12:13] and so you can even operate the gifts of
[1:12:16] the Spirit
[1:12:17] like Caiaphas who prophesied you can
[1:12:20] work the gifts of the Spirit and it'd be
[1:12:23] the genuine Holy Spirit on you speaking
[1:12:26] in tongues you can do all those things
[1:12:28] and prophesy and your soul not having
[1:12:32] Christ sitting on your throne room
[1:12:36] so the third poll is the revealing of
[1:12:39] the word and it's down into the soul
[1:12:41] which is the heart of man Thy word o God
[1:12:44] oh Lord if I hid in my heart that I
[1:12:49] learn not to sin against you
[1:12:52] so the third pull Ministry
[1:12:55] watch this the word being revealed
[1:12:58] in such a way that it's a separation
[1:13:02] it's a circumcision
[1:13:04] I want you to understand that when the
[1:13:06] sword was uh came into the prophet's
[1:13:09] hand what was God doing
[1:13:11] he's giving a sharp two-edged sword
[1:13:15] and now he's going to take the prophet
[1:13:17] of God and he's going to cut away
[1:13:20] all of the carnal fleshly intellectual
[1:13:23] teachings of man and he's going to bring
[1:13:26] forth a pure
[1:13:28] word
[1:13:30] all of the flesh all of the intellectual
[1:13:33] teachings all of the probings and though
[1:13:36] they were great men and intellectual
[1:13:39] this bride in order to be raptured she
[1:13:42] had to have a rapturing message
[1:13:45] she had to have a pure message why she's
[1:13:48] going to be a pure word bride do you
[1:13:52] understand it you got to preach the pure
[1:13:54] word and have the word circumcised away
[1:13:58] from all of denominational teaching he's
[1:14:01] not father-son Holy Ghost he's Lord
[1:14:03] Jesus Christ there's only one not three
[1:14:07] hear o Israel the Lord your God is one
[1:14:11] God
[1:14:12] so now this seventh angel
[1:14:15] when he's caught up into the consolation
[1:14:18] of seven angels what God is doing he's
[1:14:22] doing something Supernatural he's being
[1:14:24] lifted up
[1:14:25] and when he's being lifted up and he
[1:14:28] came into the constellation of these
[1:14:30] angels and each one of them had a
[1:14:33] mystery of a seal
[1:14:35] that he would give to the prophet of God
[1:14:39] and so this understanding
[1:14:42] brother brenham's carnal understanding
[1:14:44] of all that he's been taught now
[1:14:47] remember when he goes to preach the
[1:14:49] seals
[1:14:51] he says God is revealed in simplicity
[1:14:55] he says Now understand when these saints
[1:14:59] come up before you
[1:15:01] it's so simple many people will Overlook
[1:15:04] it
[1:15:05] but God is revealed in Simplicity and he
[1:15:08] had to pull himself away from influence
[1:15:11] of people stay in a room and wait before
[1:15:14] God and I'll tell you most of you the
[1:15:17] reason you don't hear more from God is
[1:15:20] you never wait on him
[1:15:22] you never you you pray and you get up
[1:15:26] you never Terry you never
[1:15:29] stay there on your knees and wait
[1:15:32] because you know what you've been
[1:15:34] talking to God but you wait for him to
[1:15:37] talk to you
[1:15:41] I remember one time when I was in a real
[1:15:43] quandary
[1:15:45] and
[1:15:47] there was no work to be had the economy
[1:15:50] went bad and
[1:15:52] I
[1:15:54] I was Roofing and Roofing was snowing
[1:15:57] every other day in Flagstaff that winter
[1:15:59] and
[1:16:00] you go to work and they say we got no
[1:16:02] work today it's snowing and
[1:16:05] and I I just was having a hard time
[1:16:08] financially
[1:16:09] I went to McDonald's I went to Jack In
[1:16:12] The Box I went everywhere I'll take any
[1:16:14] job any job I can find
[1:16:17] and I remember they built a brand new
[1:16:19] Ralston purina plant up in Flagstaff
[1:16:22] and I had a friend of mine Brother Ray
[1:16:23] Robson who's got a degree in college and
[1:16:26] in business and stuff and you know I
[1:16:29] didn't get a degree in college
[1:16:32] and he said brother Ron he said why
[1:16:34] don't we go and apply at Ross and Purina
[1:16:38] I said
[1:16:41] I I said okay I mean I'll try anything
[1:16:45] and we went that day in and Ray is
[1:16:48] always early like myself he just happens
[1:16:50] to go early the line of cars to go in
[1:16:54] the gate just to apply was over a mile
[1:16:56] and a half long
[1:16:58] I looked at I said
[1:17:00] good grief turn around
[1:17:02] there's 6 000 people applying for about
[1:17:05] 120 jobs
[1:17:08] I thought
[1:17:10] you know well so we just we no races no
[1:17:13] no hey we're gonna wait in line we're
[1:17:15] going to do it come on Ron and so anyway
[1:17:17] I went in and signed a deal and and uh
[1:17:21] I just kind of forgot about it and I
[1:17:24] went home and I I got in desperation
[1:17:27] with God sometimes that's what it takes
[1:17:29] with each one of you and it takes a time
[1:17:31] of desperation and I was I I just was
[1:17:35] weeping
[1:17:37] I was there on I remember it was a
[1:17:40] bedroom that our son Amos a little
[1:17:42] bedroom for the for him had the little
[1:17:44] bassinet up there in front of us in the
[1:17:46] little place of the kid sleeps
[1:17:48] I was on the floor and had this rug and
[1:17:51] I had my hands in the floor in the rug
[1:17:53] there and I'm crying
[1:17:55] and I'm really crying out before God and
[1:17:57] I'm pouring my soul out and I said
[1:18:00] father
[1:18:01] I need work I says I'm not lazy I'll go
[1:18:05] I will work it doesn't matter father I
[1:18:08] just need a job
[1:18:10] and I cried and I said oh Lord if he
[1:18:13] just you're a Waymaker now my father
[1:18:16] watch this and show you how the devil
[1:18:18] will dangle something in front of you my
[1:18:22] father says son because I told him I'm
[1:18:24] having a hard time he said my father
[1:18:26] having been a jockey knows all the
[1:18:28] professional horse racing he knows
[1:18:30] everybody in the business and and
[1:18:33] because my father was famous he said uh
[1:18:36] my father happened to talk to this one
[1:18:38] trainer and he said hey I got a job for
[1:18:40] your son if he wants to take it it's
[1:18:42] over in California and he can run a
[1:18:44] ranch over here and have horses and
[1:18:46] he'll have a truck an expense and oh man
[1:18:49] yeah yeah and oh well I'll just go over
[1:18:51] there for a couple years and I'll take
[1:18:53] care of that ranch and
[1:18:55] no God told me get out of California
[1:18:58] so here I am and I'm in this quandary
[1:19:01] and oh just having a hard time and holy
[1:19:04] spirit spoke to me
[1:19:05] saints of God I lie not behind his
[1:19:09] sacred desk
[1:19:11] there was a voice that spoke to me and
[1:19:13] said which job do you want
[1:19:16] and I said I want a job at Ross and
[1:19:18] Purina
[1:19:19] and I spoke it out loud
[1:19:23] there was a voice that said and what's
[1:19:25] amazing as I hear this voice and I
[1:19:28] answer out loud
[1:19:30] I want a job at Ross and Purina
[1:19:35] I said it and
[1:19:37] okay there was nothing else Thou shalt
[1:19:40] have the job no no there was enough
[1:19:42] bolts of lightning there was nothing I
[1:19:44] wasn't oh yes no
[1:19:47] I just wiped my eyes
[1:19:51] okay I don't know what I'm gonna do next
[1:19:54] day I get a a letter in the mail
[1:19:57] and it says you're you're you have to go
[1:20:00] in for an interview
[1:20:03] hi Glenda again I have an interview
[1:20:06] they said okay you get hired I'm hired
[1:20:09] yeah yeah well you have to take a
[1:20:10] physical okay I know I'll pass a
[1:20:12] physical anyway uh uh I said hey
[1:20:16] uh how many people
[1:20:18] were hired before me
[1:20:21] they said you're the first
[1:20:25] out of 6
[1:20:27] 000 applicants
[1:20:28] I was the first employee hired
[1:20:31] and they said well you can go in and
[1:20:33] Char you can choose your locker your
[1:20:37] locker number what key you want and
[1:20:39] everything guess what Locker number I
[1:20:40] wanted
[1:20:44] number seven yeah I want number seven
[1:20:46] seventh completion and so anyway I'm
[1:20:50] just telling you that a lot of time
[1:20:51] saints of God when you get into a place
[1:20:55] and you are desperate before God and you
[1:20:57] get on your knees and you cry after you
[1:21:00] get done crying and after you get done
[1:21:02] praying and after you
[1:21:04] put your petition before God wait
[1:21:09] give him time
[1:21:12] to answer
[1:21:15] and keep your spirit softened
[1:21:19] okay
[1:21:21] because he will speak to you
[1:21:24] if you seek
[1:21:26] you shall find
[1:21:28] if you ask
[1:21:30] it shall be given if you knock
[1:21:33] the door shall be opened
[1:21:35] but you've got to do something
[1:21:37] and so I want all of you to understand
[1:21:39] this principle
[1:21:41] that if you get in desperation before
[1:21:44] God God will answer you in fact brother
[1:21:47] Branham said yeah he said it's too too
[1:21:50] bad that you have to get in Desperate
[1:21:54] situations to get God to move but a lot
[1:21:58] of times you have become complacent
[1:22:03] and lukewarm
[1:22:05] and you haven't been really serious do
[1:22:08] you know God knows when you're serious
[1:22:12] if you don't think God knows when you're
[1:22:15] serious my dog knows when I'm serious or
[1:22:18] not
[1:22:20] my cute little schnauzer
[1:22:23] Edelweiss
[1:22:25] yeah that's what we named her Edelweiss
[1:22:27] because she's German the other one was
[1:22:30] Schatzi which means treasure anyway
[1:22:34] I can be you know I will say hey get
[1:22:38] down from there
[1:22:40] and the dog will look at me like
[1:22:43] but if I got that voice hey get them
[1:22:47] like that and then she just and she's
[1:22:49] looking at me like okay
[1:22:52] today I was riding a bicycle I got way
[1:22:55] far away from him she's a football field
[1:22:57] behind me I'm sitting here
[1:23:02] did a coyote get her where is she
[1:23:05] here's this little white dot I said Ada
[1:23:10] Ada get down there
[1:23:12] she looks at me sniffs around the bush a
[1:23:15] little bit off to run and she comes
[1:23:17] she's coming up to me and I'm standing
[1:23:19] there with my hand on my hip and she
[1:23:21] knows
[1:23:26] yeah and I go to walk toward her and her
[1:23:29] Hind and went down towards the ground
[1:23:30] like what
[1:23:32] I said stay with me
[1:23:37] all of you know that when you're serious
[1:23:40] or when God is serious with you and he
[1:23:43] tells you hey don't have lag back behind
[1:23:45] Stay With Me
[1:23:46] come walk with me stay right here you
[1:23:49] know when God is serious he's got that
[1:23:52] tone about you mom you know when you're
[1:23:55] speaking to your kids they know when
[1:23:59] you're serious or not
[1:24:01] when they use your full name
[1:24:05] oh yeah yeah okay
[1:24:08] my my mom used to count to three
[1:24:11] okay you better you better be here one
[1:24:15] two
[1:24:16] huh and we never moved until right
[1:24:19] before three
[1:24:21] isn't that the nature of uh huh she
[1:24:24] didn't go one two three
[1:24:29] States
[1:24:34] God knows how to get your attention
[1:24:37] and he knows when you're serious
[1:24:40] and he says if you will seek me you
[1:24:42] shall find me
[1:24:43] if you will actually come before me and
[1:24:47] bring your petition I will answer you
[1:24:53] God circumcised this message with the
[1:24:57] opening of The Seven Seals
[1:24:59] he took away all of the fleshly and
[1:25:02] carnal teachings of different ones down
[1:25:05] Through the Ages and brought to us a
[1:25:08] pure word it had to be it had to cut
[1:25:11] away everything it was false
[1:25:14] everything that was wrong and when the
[1:25:16] prophet was caught up into those seven
[1:25:18] angels you know what God was doing he
[1:25:20] was taking this message and giving it
[1:25:23] lip to ear to his prophet
[1:25:27] you have to sow an unadulterated seed to
[1:25:32] grow an under
[1:25:34] unadulterated Harvest
[1:25:37] if you sow her hybrid seed you'll get a
[1:25:41] hybrid Harvest
[1:25:43] if you sow a mingled seed you will get a
[1:25:48] mingled Harvest
[1:25:50] if you sow a corrupted seed
[1:25:53] you will get a corrupted Harvest
[1:25:57] it must be a pure word seed
[1:26:01] to produce
[1:26:03] a pure word bride
[1:26:06] restoration the bride tree God has set
[1:26:09] all of his laws to serve him both
[1:26:11] natural and spiritual working according
[1:26:14] to his word regardless of the conditions
[1:26:16] I love that I have a scripture on that
[1:26:19] yes sir God sets all of his laws in
[1:26:22] motion
[1:26:25] ever if God ever set a law of in motion
[1:26:29] then we can recognize the law
[1:26:33] and we can put that law into effect and
[1:26:37] reap the same results let me give you an
[1:26:40] example
[1:26:41] in Hosea 8 verse 7 it says for they have
[1:26:45] sown the wind and they shall reap the
[1:26:48] Whirlwind
[1:26:49] now this is both natural
[1:26:51] and spiritual
[1:26:53] because if you sow to the wind you shall
[1:26:56] reap a whirlwind but if you sow to the
[1:26:59] world you shall reap worldly things but
[1:27:02] if you sow to the spirit and you walk in
[1:27:06] the spirit you shall reap a whole
[1:27:09] Whirlwind of spiritual blessings
[1:27:18] and do you know that you will reap
[1:27:21] according to proportion
[1:27:27] the Bible says in second Corinthians 9
[1:27:30] and 6 but this I say he which soweth
[1:27:33] sparingly
[1:27:37] shall reap also sparingly
[1:27:42] and he which soweth bountifully
[1:27:45] shall reap also bountifully
[1:27:48] it is reward according to proportion
[1:27:52] how much time
[1:27:54] did you put in with God this past week
[1:27:59] and you want these great blessings and
[1:28:02] you want air and I need this and I want
[1:28:04] that is your prayer life nothing but I
[1:28:07] want
[1:28:08] or God do
[1:28:09] or please give
[1:28:15] wouldn't it be nice
[1:28:18] that God
[1:28:20] here's your prayer sometime and all you
[1:28:22] do you're never ask him for anything but
[1:28:25] you praise him for all the goodness that
[1:28:27] he's done for you
[1:28:29] father thank you that I had a good bed
[1:28:32] to sleep in thank you I have a home
[1:28:33] thank you I have food in the closet

[1:28:49] home in heaven thank you Lord Thou Art
[1:28:51] so merciful and just go on and on and
[1:28:54] thank him and never ask him for nothing
[1:29:00] I tell you what what works on me
[1:29:04] is when my wife comes over
[1:29:07] and she starts doing good things
[1:29:10] honey would you like some tea
[1:29:12] oh yes thank you sweetheart that'd be
[1:29:15] lovely
[1:29:16] would you like a little snack to go with
[1:29:18] it now when when there's two or three
[1:29:20] things line up in a row
[1:29:23] okay
[1:29:25] what do you want
[1:29:31] how about that with you
[1:29:36] do you
[1:29:37] when you come before God
[1:29:40] why don't you do things
[1:29:42] nice and say good and nice things to him
[1:29:45] and then he says
[1:29:48] what do you want my good and faithful
[1:29:50] servant
[1:29:51] what can I do for you today
[1:29:54] oh my too much of the time we go about
[1:29:58] our daily business
[1:30:00] without ever taking time for him
[1:30:03] and when we do we're too rushed
[1:30:07] huh hurry up Lord and bless me
[1:30:11] when it would be in a whole lot better
[1:30:13] for you to read two verses and say
[1:30:16] father make these verses fruitful to my
[1:30:18] mind that I know because thou art a lamp
[1:30:21] unto my feet thou art a
[1:30:24] a shield under my soul you father are

[1:30:44] anybody to believe what you believe and
[1:30:47] if you're not happy about what you
[1:30:48] believe
[1:30:50] when we all get to heaven

[1:32:48] I am do you know what saints of God
[1:32:51] let me just tell you right now I'm in
[1:32:54] love with Jesus Christ
[1:32:55] and I love this message and you will
[1:32:58] never
[1:32:59] win anybody to what you believe unless
[1:33:03] you're happy about what you got
[1:33:06] amen
[1:33:07] amen listen seeds of God we should be
[1:33:10] happy about everything I read a quote
[1:33:13] today wow I read a quote today it says
[1:33:16] any of you ever have your temper tantrum
[1:33:18] you ever had a deal where you just got
[1:33:21] yeah
[1:33:23] you ever have one of those days
[1:33:26] and don't tell on yourself
[1:33:29] my brother Ram said you watch that
[1:33:30] because it'll cause cancer
[1:33:35] he says you losing control of your
[1:33:39] temper
[1:33:40] which is next to insanity
[1:33:43] he says you will pay for it in your body
[1:33:47] you'll get a cancer or some kind of
[1:33:49] tumor because he says you know what you
[1:33:52] should do you should be happy so I'm
[1:33:54] going to tell all of you
[1:33:56] be happy
[1:33:58] so next time somebody else starts
[1:34:00] throwing a just tell them hey hey you
[1:34:02] don't want cancer
[1:34:05] be happy
[1:34:07] what are you talking about
[1:34:10] the prophet of God was telling us it's a
[1:34:13] very good quote go look it up
[1:34:16] so
[1:34:19] yeah
[1:34:24] Abraham tried to bring the word of God
[1:34:27] to pass himself
[1:34:28] with his own carnal understanding and
[1:34:30] when he did he didn't bring nothing to
[1:34:33] pass except for an ishmaelite a wild man
[1:34:38] a lot of times we try to bring something
[1:34:40] to pass because of the way we think it's
[1:34:42] going to be and we put our own
[1:34:44] interpretation to it or we put a
[1:34:47] speculation to what we think God is
[1:34:50] going to do or how he's going to bring
[1:34:53] the word to pass
[1:34:55] what we need is revelation not
[1:34:58] speculation
[1:34:59] because every time that we have
[1:35:01] speculation which is people trying to
[1:35:04] make the word come to pass through their
[1:35:07] understanding and God is his own
[1:35:11] interpreter he don't need your help he
[1:35:14] don't need you to try to figure it out
[1:35:15] in fact he said by his Prophet every
[1:35:18] time you got it figured out there's one
[1:35:20] thing you know for sure you're wrong
[1:35:23] so I'm not gonna waste my time trying to
[1:35:25] figure it out
[1:35:27] well what if how's it going to be what
[1:35:29] what how will it be how quickly when
[1:35:33] when we're going to get changed in a
[1:35:35] moment you know I'm afraid of heights
[1:35:37] what about in the air I don't like being
[1:35:38] in the air would it be
[1:35:46] relax
[1:35:50] Ed yeah any of you afraid of heights
[1:35:52] really anybody here afraid of heights my
[1:35:54] wife is raise your hand Sani she's
[1:35:56] afraid to hide
[1:35:59] she wouldn't even raise her hand
[1:36:02] if you're afraid of heights think about
[1:36:04] this and we'll be caught together with
[1:36:06] him in the air
[1:36:08] do you think of yourself floating up in
[1:36:10] the airplane
[1:36:14] okay
[1:36:16] no no it's not going to be like we think
[1:36:20] in the air is another dimension in fact
[1:36:23] saints of God brother Ram said if you
[1:36:25] think that you're going to go off past
[1:36:27] the white Milky Way fast and this and he
[1:36:31] said forget it you're just changing
[1:36:33] dimensions
[1:36:35] hallelujah we're not going off somewhere
[1:36:38] else we're changing a dimension
[1:36:46] in fact
[1:36:48] Stephen Hawking
[1:36:50] one of the greatest Minds that of this
[1:36:54] generation
[1:36:55] Stephen Hawking wrote a a book called A
[1:36:58] Brief History of Time
[1:37:00] and I got that and you know what I never
[1:37:03] go to the library I never go through a
[1:37:05] library looking for books but I just
[1:37:07] happened to pick that book up that day I
[1:37:10] thought oh this would be interesting
[1:37:11] quantum physics
[1:37:14] and I want to go ahead and I want to see
[1:37:15] what one of the brightest mind has to do
[1:37:18] about A Brief History of Time and he
[1:37:21] says we can prove by quantum mechanics
[1:37:24] and physics that there is an equal and
[1:37:27] opposite World in an anti-matter world
[1:37:31] that is a it is the same image of what
[1:37:35] you have here but made of anti-matter
[1:37:40] and he says it's just another dimension
[1:37:43] in fact he said if you ever meet your
[1:37:46] anti-self
[1:37:48] he said if your your other
[1:37:51] body ever comes up whatever you do don't
[1:37:55] shake hands with it this is this is
[1:37:57] Stephen Hawking don't do it because he
[1:38:00] said you will disappear into a ball of
[1:38:02] light
[1:38:03] and I thought
[1:38:07] because God
[1:38:09] is light
[1:38:13] and he says watch this he said if we
[1:38:16] could take man and go to the speed of
[1:38:18] light
[1:38:20] he says we can prove time stops
[1:38:25] if we can go to the speed of light time
[1:38:28] stops in fact they say our astronauts go
[1:38:32] off the Earth orbit around a little bit
[1:38:34] go to the Moon whatever come back and
[1:38:37] they're younger
[1:38:38] than they would have than they would
[1:38:40] have been if they'd have stayed here on
[1:38:42] Earth
[1:38:43] okay how they figure that out I don't
[1:38:46] know was it the watch they were I don't
[1:38:48] know
[1:38:50] I just believe what they told me so
[1:38:53] but if we could go to the speed of light
[1:38:56] time stops
[1:38:58] what if I go go past the threshold of
[1:39:01] the speed of light
[1:39:05] watch this all of a sudden now I can
[1:39:08] reverse time
[1:39:10] now Stephen Hawking says we can prove
[1:39:13] that the earth started with a big bang
[1:39:15] bang
[1:39:17] and God said let to be light bang I
[1:39:20] don't care how they call it I don't care
[1:39:22] how far back they take it guess what God
[1:39:24] started this whole thing with a bang
[1:39:28] and he says and since that being
[1:39:31] everything has been going and going and
[1:39:34] going and the universe is expanding but
[1:39:36] they said we can tell that it's reaching
[1:39:39] its maximum place and he says it's
[1:39:42] starting to stop and slow down and it's
[1:39:45] ready to start coming back
[1:39:47] and he says because you know what it's
[1:39:49] going to come back to its original
[1:39:52] position
[1:39:56] all saints of God I tell you what this
[1:39:59] message
[1:40:00] is so amazing the more I read it and the
[1:40:04] more that I see a man with a seventh
[1:40:06] grade education
[1:40:08] look into these things can look into the
[1:40:12] very word of God and begin to show us
[1:40:14] the Mysteries
[1:40:16] of God and all the things remember now
[1:40:19] the seventh angel has got no particular
[1:40:22] mystery
[1:40:24] it's it's not anything specific he's got
[1:40:27] he takes all of the Loose Ends
[1:40:30] yes he takes part of Clarence Larkin yes
[1:40:33] he takes part of his love to Babylon yes
[1:40:36] he takes free niacin father yes
[1:40:39] so some of those that say oh well the
[1:40:41] prophet he took some from this guy and
[1:40:43] some from Luther and Wesley and yes yes
[1:40:46] yes
[1:40:47] he did they were all men of God but this
[1:40:51] seventh angel he begins to take the very
[1:40:55] mystery of God he goes beyond the
[1:40:58] beginning of time he goes he says he he
[1:41:01] says in the beginning was the word he
[1:41:03] says today I want to go before the
[1:41:06] beginning
[1:41:07] there was never a preacher ever in that
[1:41:10] ever said let's go beyond before the
[1:41:13] beginning
[1:41:14] when God was not a God when he was not a
[1:41:18] being of worship when he was accountant
[1:41:21] a fountain of colors and he had all
[1:41:23] these attributes
[1:41:25] and he wasn't even God because a god is
[1:41:28] an object of worship
[1:41:30] and he wanted to be a savior and he
[1:41:32] wanted to be a redeemer and he had all
[1:41:36] these attributes
[1:41:38] I wanted to have a family and I wanted
[1:41:40] to
[1:41:41] and he says and there all of these
[1:41:43] attributes this Fountain of colors
[1:41:47] he says and he says out of that colors
[1:41:50] came up a clinker when it was the logos
[1:41:54] he said the very thought of God
[1:41:57] and he said the logos thought it blew it
[1:41:59] come off to you out of this Fountain of
[1:42:01] colors and there it was the logos and in
[1:42:04] the beginning was the logos and the
[1:42:06] logos was God and the logos came out of
[1:42:08] God
[1:42:10] and the logos took on a form and became
[1:42:12] a flesh being so that you and I because
[1:42:16] you and I have a problem we cannot love
[1:42:20] something that we don't understand
[1:42:24] how can we have a relationship with
[1:42:27] something that we can't see
[1:42:30] so what God did is he came down in the
[1:42:33] form of human flesh so that they could
[1:42:35] see they could handle and he became a
[1:42:37] man of like passion like you and I but
[1:42:41] without sin
[1:42:43] but he did it so he could be tempted in
[1:42:46] all manners like you so if you ever are
[1:42:49] in a trouble and you're having a hard
[1:42:50] time guess what you can say father I'm
[1:42:53] having a hard time and you were tempted
[1:42:55] with this so you know what I'm going
[1:42:57] through
[1:43:02] Solomon said there's nothing new Under
[1:43:04] the Sun
[1:43:06] everything is Vanity and vexation of
[1:43:09] spirit
[1:43:10] Solomon says Hey here I go and I can get
[1:43:12] all this stuff and everything everything
[1:43:14] that my mind and my eyes wanted to
[1:43:17] conceive and everything I wanted to have
[1:43:19] God gave it to me and he said you know
[1:43:22] what he says and God gives me all of
[1:43:24] this and I've got children that don't
[1:43:26] have wisdom and when I die they're going
[1:43:29] to take it and just foolishly
[1:43:32] spend it it's vexation
[1:43:35] a spirit
[1:43:36] imagine
[1:43:40] it's all vanity
[1:43:42] what is success what makes you happy
[1:43:45] huh
[1:43:47] when are you going to be happy
[1:43:49] when you reach the Pinnacle I'll get my
[1:43:51] four-year degree and I'll I'll make
[1:43:53] sixty thousand dollars and then I'm
[1:43:55] happy
[1:43:56] no you make 60 you want
[1:43:59] 160. you make 160 you want 260 and then
[1:44:02] 360 and pretty soon hey yeah these guys
[1:44:06] that are multi-billionaires they never
[1:44:08] quit
[1:44:09] they're working all the time it's not
[1:44:11] fair
[1:44:13] they're making more money
[1:44:16] none of them retire they're still
[1:44:19] boss of the company
[1:44:21] anyway saints of God
[1:44:24] I began to look at this message
[1:44:27] from a different perspective when God
[1:44:29] began to say
[1:44:33] move away from the message of being so
[1:44:36] close to it
[1:44:38] stand back and get an overview
[1:44:41] wow
[1:44:44] and when you stand back and you get an
[1:44:46] overview of this message
[1:44:49] and you just read the sermon titles
[1:44:51] you're following now the evolution
[1:44:53] follow this
[1:44:55] you're following the evolution of the
[1:44:58] mystery of God being revealed
[1:45:02] and you see how God is dealing with his
[1:45:05] Prophet have you ever heard you can't
[1:45:07] see the forest for the trees
[1:45:10] well some people all they do is they
[1:45:13] read but they they're they're looking so
[1:45:15] intently
[1:45:17] they got their head down here like this
[1:45:23] and I think a lot of you young kids
[1:45:26] this is how you're going to read when
[1:45:28] you get older
[1:45:30] because you sit on the couch and you've
[1:45:33] got a little iPad or you got a little
[1:45:36] iPhone and it's about six or eight
[1:45:38] inches from your face

[1:45:53] ever give your kid but you know what
[1:45:54] kids throwing a fit
[1:45:57] wow shut up here get an iPad here iPhone

[1:47:50] that
[1:47:51] I don't want to pop your bubble
[1:47:54] I don't want to uh make you think that
[1:47:58] you are going to have some trials but
[1:48:00] Jesus said they that live Godly shall
[1:48:03] suffer persecution you will be hated
[1:48:09] for my namesake
[1:48:11] people won't like you
[1:48:15] if you want to be liked don't be a
[1:48:17] Christian
[1:48:25] I used to carry my Bible to school
[1:48:28] four years in high school
[1:48:31] I carried my Bible to school
[1:48:34] I had a young young guy come up to me
[1:48:36] said hey you're such a weakling you have
[1:48:39] to carry your Bible to school I said
[1:48:41] here you carry it
[1:48:46] if you think it takes a weakling you
[1:48:49] carry it I used to sit at my lunch hour
[1:48:54] under a tree on my school campus and I
[1:48:57] had Bible study Elias
[1:49:00] just a young boy I didn't know what I
[1:49:02] was doing all I knew is I loved God and
[1:49:05] I loved his Bible
[1:49:06] and we said next thing I know a couple
[1:49:09] guys couple girls we sit there we pray
[1:49:14] and in my yearbook you know you know how
[1:49:16] you pass your yearbook around and
[1:49:18] everybody signs it it's amazing I went
[1:49:21] back and read a lot of the
[1:49:23] it says Ron we know what you're probably
[1:49:26] going to be when you grow up
[1:49:29] probably going to be a preacher
[1:49:31] somewhere
[1:49:32] I never wanted to be a preacher
[1:49:35] but I know this I loved him
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:40] never forget the first time I went to a
[1:49:42] Bible study
[1:49:43] never been in a Bible study
[1:49:46] never been around Christians never no
[1:49:51] we sat in a circle
[1:49:53] we sat on the floor Hollis Allen was the
[1:49:56] Presbyterian minister
[1:50:00] you know what I liked about Holland
[1:50:01] Hollis
[1:50:03] he was genuine he was real
[1:50:06] I don't know how old he was maybe he was
[1:50:08] 45 he looked like an old man to me here
[1:50:11] I am
[1:50:14] 1450.
[1:50:16] we sit down on the floor
[1:50:19] and they pass out Bibles and
[1:50:24] okay everybody takes time to read and it
[1:50:27] came time for me to read my verse
[1:50:30] and so I'm reading my Bible verse
[1:50:33] because you know what I can read I went
[1:50:35] to school so I know how to read
[1:50:37] so I read my verse and I was rudely
[1:50:40] interrupted by somebody saying praise
[1:50:42] the Lord that's spiritual food
[1:50:46] are that strong meat
[1:50:49] and I'm going
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:50:54] what are you
[1:50:56] talking about
[1:50:59] and I'm just thinking it's rude for you
[1:51:01] to interrupt me so I'll go ahead are you
[1:51:04] done
[1:51:06] yeah yeah I'm done okay can I finish I
[1:51:09] started finish and somebody else now
[1:51:12] yeah that was so good
[1:51:15] [Music]
[1:51:16] I never forget
[1:51:19] I said father what do they see that I
[1:51:21] don't
[1:51:24] it's not fair Lord
[1:51:27] if they see something and it's genuine
[1:51:29] and they get excited
[1:51:32] show me
[1:51:34] and then let me accept or reject because
[1:51:37] I don't know that I'll accept it I
[1:51:40] I'm skeptical I've seen a lot of people
[1:51:42] who claim to be Christians
[1:51:45] and some of them were the worst that I
[1:51:47] knew
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:52] I'll never forget the time that I asked
[1:51:54] Jesus Christ to come into my life
[1:51:57] wasn't a big deal
[1:52:00] but Hollis right there with maybe 10 12
[1:52:02] kids that's all it was
[1:52:06] and he said is there anybody here that
[1:52:08] you'd like to give your life to Christ
[1:52:10] and I didn't know what that was all I
[1:52:13] knew is I fell in love with somebody
[1:52:16] called Jesus
[1:52:17] he died for my sins I there was
[1:52:20] something about Jesus
[1:52:22] that pulled me
[1:52:25] and so I did and he led me in a sinner's
[1:52:28] prayer
[1:52:30] and when I got done and I got outside
[1:52:34] there were telephone wires telephone
[1:52:36] poles power lines above us as high as
[1:52:40] this ceiling
[1:52:41] and I says I feel like it can reach up
[1:52:44] and grab I feel like I said I'm so light
[1:52:48] I feel like I could run forever
[1:52:51] what it was was all of the burdens
[1:52:55] of all of life was to he said cast all
[1:52:59] your cares on me take my yoke upon you
[1:53:02] my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:53:04] and for the first time in my life as a
[1:53:07] young man I felt freedom
[1:53:11] because everything else in life bound me
[1:53:15] your friends will bind you drugs will
[1:53:17] bind you everything will bind you but
[1:53:20] first this is the first time
[1:53:23] I feel free
[1:53:25] wow because the Bible says that he whom
[1:53:28] the son has set free
[1:53:31] is free indeed
[1:53:33] and the reason that I can stand up here
[1:53:36] before all of you
[1:53:37] tonight not because I'm something
[1:53:40] special
[1:53:42] I'm just an ordinary guy who fell in
[1:53:45] love with God and I love him so much
[1:53:47] that I'm a fool for Christ
[1:53:50] I am
[1:53:52] the first book that I ever read was
[1:53:55] called the oddball
[1:53:57] guess what brother Bobby I became the
[1:53:59] oddball
[1:54:02] I identify with the oddball
[1:54:05] I am I'm odd I am weird the Bible calls
[1:54:09] you a peculiar people
[1:54:11] yeah you are
[1:54:13] and I know this I love him and I know
[1:54:16] he's coming soon
[1:54:20] and he's putting it upon my heart to
[1:54:22] tell all of you get ready

[1:57:48] not yelling at the people it's not
[1:57:50] telling them what they need to do but
[1:57:54] maybe what you're doing right now is
