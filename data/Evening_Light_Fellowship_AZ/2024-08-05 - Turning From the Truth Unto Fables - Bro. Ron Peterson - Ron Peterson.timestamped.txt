[56:15] the element the season in which we're in
[56:19] amen he take sermons sir is this the
[56:24] time who do you say that is what is this
[56:28] attraction who is this mzc
[56:33] yes he preaches sermons such as
[56:36] Blasphemous
[56:38] names enticing Spirits anointed ones at
[56:41] the end
[56:42] time and he begins to rightly divide the
[56:46] word of God for this hour
[56:50] amen
[56:52] and certain sermons he will say and from
[56:56] that that
[56:58] time knowing that there was a junction
[57:01] of time that something
[57:05] happen that made an irreversible course
[57:08] in people's lives and in things they do
[57:12] we see America on the
[57:14] brink of the biggest change she's ever
[57:18] made and ever going to be made among our
[57:21] government I am not a politician not a
[57:24] Republican and Democrat I am a Christian
[57:27] amen amen but I want to say you're about
[57:31] to see the biggest change that America

[57:40] better that's right he said the times
[57:44] will wax worse and worse so when you
[57:47] think of worst case
[57:50] scenario then you know the direction
[57:52] we're
[57:53] going brother brandham in 1950 six said
[57:56] America has rejected the gospel and he
[57:59] says I no longer pray for he says you

[58:09] irreversible course
[58:12] amen and we're
[58:14] there
[58:18] now I'm going to be speaking some things
[58:21] this morning that is to this church and
[58:23] to my sheep

[58:29] our sermons they listen to them there
[58:32] are many people that stream our services
[58:35] live around the
[58:36] world and
[58:38] um uh so they listen to what I
[58:44] preach and some um have
[58:49] uh chose to speak against
[58:53] me and to put things up on
[58:56] YouTube and to go against me and that's
[59:00] fine hey hey I do not surf the Internet
[59:04] I'm not looking for you know who's who
[59:06] and what's saying and this and that
[59:08] because let me tell you all it'll do is
[59:10] bring
[59:11] confusion you know I don't tell you I
[59:14] forbid you not n hey hey the critics are
[59:17] going to always be there the most

[1:02:58] church as all the way from the book of
[1:03:00] Genesis to the Book of Revelation we see
[1:03:04] the mixing of seed we see the doctrines
[1:03:06] of devils we see those withstanding the
[1:03:09] truth whether it was in the time of
[1:03:11] Moses whether it was in the time of
[1:03:13] Jesus whether it was in the time of the
[1:03:15] early Apostles until this very hour

[1:05:50] among the
[1:05:51] people even as there shall be false
[1:05:54] teachers among you
[1:05:56] who shall privy bring in damnable
[1:05:59] heresies even denying the Lord that
[1:06:02] bought them and bring upon themselves
[1:06:06] Swift
[1:06:08] destruction and many shall follow their
[1:06:10] pernicious Ways by reason of whom the

[1:07:25] the
[1:07:27] better but for the
[1:07:31] worse for first of all when you come
[1:07:34] together in the
[1:07:35] church I hear there be divisions among
[1:07:38] you and I partly believe
[1:07:40] it for there must also for there must be
[1:07:44] also heresies among
[1:07:47] you that they which are approved may be
[1:07:50] made manifest among
[1:07:53] you now that may be a little bit hard
[1:07:55] hard to understand in the King James
[1:07:57] version so I took the revised Standard
[1:07:59] Version and let me read from there but
[1:08:01] in the following instructions I do not
[1:08:04] commend you because when you come
[1:08:07] together it's not for the better but for
[1:08:08] the worse for in the first place when
[1:08:11] you assemble as a
[1:08:13] church I hear that there there are
[1:08:15] divisions among you and I partly believe
[1:08:17] it for there must be factions among you
[1:08:20] in order that those who are genuine
[1:08:23] among you may be recognized
[1:08:26] amen I am titling my sermon this morning
[1:08:31] turning from the truth unto
[1:08:35] fables and I want to take a subject this
[1:08:37] morning as the damnable heresies among
[1:08:40] the
[1:08:41] message now I've told you the deception
[1:08:44] is not going to come outside amen but
[1:08:48] it'll be so close the Bible says it'll
[1:08:50] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:08:54] possible but for the elect's
[1:08:57] sake he'll shorten the days otherwise it
[1:09:01] would be no flesh saved imagine that it
[1:09:03] would get that bad that no one would be
[1:09:06] saved but I thank God that he's
[1:09:08] shortening the days amen amen now as you
[1:09:13] all know I've been preaching on some
[1:09:15] subjects for the past several
[1:09:17] weeks and uh such as trying the spirits
[1:09:21] within the
[1:09:22] message calling them eles Apostles and
[1:09:27] are not and found them to be
[1:09:31] liars and uh I must say it's caused
[1:09:34] quite a stir among some of those within
[1:09:36] the message and the prophet of God says
[1:09:39] when you throw a rock into amongst a
[1:09:41] pack of dogs you know the one that gets
[1:09:44] hit is the one who yells that's right
[1:09:47] you
[1:09:49] understand okay so some of my sermons
[1:09:52] have really exposed the devil Lord
[1:09:56] that's
[1:09:57] right I'm here to tell you truth not to
[1:10:01] the Apostle Paul said look should I try
[1:10:03] to be the friend of every man or do I
[1:10:05] keep my friendship with Christ amen amen
[1:10:09] amen so just as the message of the hour
[1:10:14] exposed the nickan spirit working among
[1:10:18] Believers and expose a Jezebel spirit
[1:10:23] that lies in organized religion
[1:10:27] and if we are not prayed
[1:10:29] up and if we are not using disc serment
[1:10:32] of
[1:10:33] spirit you could be
[1:10:36] easily taken over by a spirit and the
[1:10:40] prophet said if a spirit like that ever
[1:10:43] gets on you you'll absolutely believe it
[1:10:47] he says I went to those
[1:10:49] people and he says tried to tell them
[1:10:52] from the Bible he said they wouldn't
[1:10:54] believe it it should are anointed with a
[1:10:56] wrong spirit amen because a Christlike
[1:11:00] spirit is
[1:11:02] teachable that's right amen amen it's
[1:11:05] correctable you will say that's why
[1:11:07] you're here you're saying hey correct me
[1:11:08] Lord if there's something in my life
[1:11:10] that's not like you correct me Father
[1:11:12] here's the Judgment judgment begins at
[1:11:15] the house of
[1:11:20] God now I realize I speak to an
[1:11:22] invisible audience also
[1:11:26] and I want to share with you just for a
[1:11:28] moment because it really blessed me this
[1:11:31] was sent on July
[1:11:33] 17th dear brother Ron Peterson greetings
[1:11:37] from your invisible
[1:11:39] audience I just wanted to take the time
[1:11:42] to tell you how much my family and I
[1:11:44] have enjoying your
[1:11:45] services it's been over a year now since
[1:11:48] we began streaming live and have been
[1:11:50] tremendously blessed I apologize for not
[1:11:54] communicating and until now and from the
[1:11:57] song leaders musicians Ministry in the
[1:12:00] church we have felt so much at home even
[1:12:04] tuning
[1:12:08] in since before the beginning of 2023 i'
[1:12:12] had actually never heard of brother Ron
[1:12:16] Peterson I'm assuming this is because
[1:12:18] I'm from the south and I've never really
[1:12:20] visited Church from the western side of
[1:12:23] the United States because of the
[1:12:25] distance I had such a wonderful time
[1:12:27] going back in the archives and listening
[1:12:29] to quite a few sermons that really help
[1:12:31] explain the things going on in a message
[1:12:34] concerning the five-fold ministry it
[1:12:37] helped to clear up a lot of questions I
[1:12:39] had I appreciate you taking the time to
[1:12:42] go over these things and even recently
[1:12:44] touching on them again I like to be on
[1:12:47] Solid Ground about such important
[1:12:52] things then she said
[1:12:56] um she about enjoying and she says thank
[1:13:00] you we will continue to tune in to your
[1:13:02] services and pray for all of you may the
[1:13:04] Lord bless you greatly for all your
[1:13:06] service and Him Sister Rebecca Addison
[1:13:09] God bless you Sister Rebecca if you are
[1:13:11] listening I have never met you that I
[1:13:13] know of personally
[1:13:17] but thank
[1:13:21] you I realize that God will hold me
[1:13:24] respons
[1:13:25] responsible because there is also an
[1:13:28] invisible
[1:13:30] audience there is
[1:13:32] people um that I have never met that
[1:13:36] tune in and listen to these
[1:13:39] services and so I say God bless her
[1:13:42] richly so now we know that according to
[1:13:45] the Book of Matthew in Matthew 24 as you
[1:13:48] want to throw the scripture up there and
[1:13:50] except those days be short and there
[1:13:52] should be no flesh saved but for the Le
[1:13:55] say those days shall be
[1:13:58] shortened but if any man shall say to
[1:14:00] you Lo here is Christ or there believe
[1:14:02] it not for there shall arise false
[1:14:05] cries false prophets and shall show
[1:14:08] great signs and wonders in so much that
[1:14:11] if it were possible they shall deceive
[1:14:15] the very elect now I said it's not going
[1:14:18] to be somebody with a Cardinal hat or
[1:14:22] something like that in denomination it's
[1:14:24] going to be some body that claims to be
[1:14:26] within
[1:14:28] truth okay
[1:14:31] so the Antichrist Spirit has mixed
[1:14:35] itself brother brm said watch the two
[1:14:38] seeds watch the two
[1:14:40] trees the tree of knowledge and the Tree
[1:14:43] of Life in Genesis and how that one one
[1:14:46] Springs up another one is there look
[1:14:48] through the parable of the swer of good
[1:14:50] seed and there was a swer of seed and it
[1:14:53] was likened unto God and he SED good
[1:14:56] seed and he seed it into the highways
[1:14:59] and the byways and in good ground and on
[1:15:02] the the side of the road and he says but
[1:15:05] while men slept there came another one
[1:15:07] who SED his seed and at the same time in
[1:15:11] the same field at the same
[1:15:14] hour there was springing up two
[1:15:16] different kind of
[1:15:18] seed do you understand that and the
[1:15:21] angel said wherewith did the tears come
[1:15:25] do you want us to go and gather up the
[1:15:27] tears take them up and cast them away he
[1:15:29] said no leave them until the end time I
[1:15:33] want you to know that we're being raised
[1:15:35] up right now among uh multi miixed seed
[1:15:41] in a field right now and they're both
[1:15:44] coming to fruition why this is the time
[1:15:47] of maturing this is the time when the
[1:15:50] fruit is ripening on top of the tree
[1:15:52] somebody say Amen to that we are no
[1:15:54] longer babes tossed about from every
[1:15:56] winded Doctrine but strong meat belongs
[1:15:59] to those who are of full age hallelujah
[1:16:02] amen
[1:16:04] amen it happened from The Book of
[1:16:06] Genesis through Exodus during the time
[1:16:10] of Moses in the time of Christ it has
[1:16:13] happened in every one of the church ages
[1:16:14] and it's happening the same way
[1:16:18] today in Revelations 2:
[1:16:22] 18-22 and under the angel of the church
[1:16:25] notice it says unto the angel of the
[1:16:28] church somebody say church church we
[1:16:30] know Church means called out
[1:16:32] ones unto the angel of the Church of
[1:16:35] thyra write these things saith the Son
[1:16:37] of God who hath eyes like unto a flame
[1:16:41] of fire and his feet are like fine brass
[1:16:44] and I Know Thy works and charity and and
[1:16:47] service and faith and thy patience and
[1:16:50] thy works and the last to be more than
[1:16:53] the first not with
[1:16:55] standing I have a few things against
[1:16:58] thee because thou sufferest that woman
[1:17:02] Jezebel with call which calleth herself
[1:17:05] a prophetess to teach and to seduce yes
[1:17:10] my servants to commit
[1:17:12] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[1:17:15] unto idols and I gave her space to
[1:17:19] repent for her fornication and she
[1:17:21] repented not behold I will cast her into
[1:17:24] a bed and them that command adultery
[1:17:26] with her into Great Tribulation except
[1:17:29] they repent of their deeds the Bible
[1:17:32] calls this also the depths of Satan the
[1:17:35] prophet showed us different things how
[1:17:38] the enemy is coming in and how he's
[1:17:40] mixed he seed he's put different things
[1:17:43] and
[1:17:44] opinions he started in the Book of
[1:17:46] Genesis and said Thou shalt not
[1:17:50] die because Eve said we can eat of every
[1:17:54] tree except for the tree of knowledge
[1:17:56] because the day you eat
[1:17:59] thereof is the day you die is that right
[1:18:02] that's what God Said but Satan said oh
[1:18:06] surely you'll not die you see all he's
[1:18:08] got to do is Twist the word he just got
[1:18:10] to take one word out of it and he
[1:18:12] changes the whole picture he seduced her
[1:18:16] with words first and then the natural
[1:18:18] took place
[1:18:24] the prophet told us things as innocent
[1:18:27] as Christmas and
[1:18:28] Easter is nothing but Pagan
[1:18:34] idolatry yeah Christianity versus
[1:18:39] idolatry go are are you listening same
[1:18:42] tapes I'm listening to and you think
[1:18:44] it's okay put a little Christmas tree
[1:18:46] some kind of pagan Idol up in your home
[1:18:49] and bow down to worship and throw tinsel
[1:18:51] on
[1:18:52] it it's pagan
[1:18:56] what part of Jezebel religion do you
[1:18:59] want to say it's
[1:19:02] okay what part of it do you
[1:19:06] want
[1:19:07] now I recently had someone here in our
[1:19:10] church one of my board members sent me a
[1:19:13] this YouTube with this guy preaching
[1:19:15] against
[1:19:16] me I see preaching he's a false
[1:19:19] prophet but he went ahead and and
[1:19:22] everything and and you know
[1:19:25] I had to listen to what he had to say in
[1:19:30] the quotes of the Prophet I were
[1:19:32] actually felt sorry for him because he's
[1:19:36] deceived he's deceived he's under a
[1:19:39] spirit of deception and he's
[1:19:43] deceived and so you know look um I want
[1:19:48] you all to know I don't surf the
[1:19:50] Internet to find all the people and all
[1:19:53] the ministers with in the message and
[1:19:56] all that because listen boy if you talk
[1:19:58] about uh a tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:20:02] Evil it's there just type in William
[1:20:05] brandham what are you going to get
[1:20:08] you'll get more bad than you will good
[1:20:10] that's right is that right so I I kind
[1:20:13] of am in one way
[1:20:17] honored to be
[1:20:19] criticized along with the prophet of
[1:20:22] this
[1:20:23] hour but these are the kinds of spirits
[1:20:25] that try to throw dirt on somebody
[1:20:27] that's anointed of God yeah yeah the
[1:20:31] Bible says mark them which cause
[1:20:32] division among you now we all know you
[1:20:36] got to go through the Hall of critics
[1:20:37] before you get to the Hall of Fame but
[1:20:40] nobody wants the critics we just want
[1:20:42] the fame well let me tell you all of you
[1:20:45] are going to be criticized on what you
[1:20:48] believe how you believe it and the way
[1:20:50] you live it right yeah yeah and those
[1:20:53] that live Godly in Christ Jesus the
[1:20:55] Bible says shall suffer persecution if
[1:20:59] you're not being persecuted if people
[1:21:01] are not speaking evil of you the Bible
[1:21:04] says beware when all men speak good of
[1:21:09] you
[1:21:10] yeah patronizing you all the time hey
[1:21:13] you're the best well I tell you what
[1:21:15] they hated Jesus for the words that he
[1:21:17] said and he said if they hated me
[1:21:21] they're going to hate you the same
[1:21:23] they'll Hate You Without a Cause yeah
[1:21:25] that's right so let me show you in the
[1:21:29] sermon actually because my wife's been
[1:21:31] asking me are you going to continue on
[1:21:33] with that the discernment of spirit well
[1:21:35] here brother Brenham in the sermon
[1:21:37] discernment of spirit here in Phoenix
[1:21:40] let me read to you what he says here did
[1:21:43] you notice when David was rejected as
[1:21:45] king he went out of the city and a
[1:21:48] little Benjamine a benjamite which is
[1:21:50] supposed to have been a brother to him
[1:21:53] should have been sorry because he was
[1:21:56] rejected but
[1:21:58] what see he was a crippled man and he
[1:22:03] drug along there with his crippled
[1:22:05] condition throwing dirt on David and
[1:22:07] calling him all kinds of bad names
[1:22:10] cursing him in the name of the Lord
[1:22:12] cursed him even called him son of
[1:22:15] bile and cursing King David in the name
[1:22:18] of the Lord this little old crippled up
[1:22:20] benjamite wash the spirit of God and the
[1:22:23] spirit of the devil
[1:22:25] working it represents the spiritual
[1:22:28] crippled of the people
[1:22:31] today that they would make fun of the
[1:22:33] true spirit of God in Christ manifesting
[1:22:36] itself you see whenever you preach the
[1:22:39] truth you expose the devil and he does
[1:22:41] not like being exposed now the prophet
[1:22:44] of God said every Revival brings forth
[1:22:46] twins twins are lookalikes yes
[1:22:52] sir there are the
[1:22:56] ishmaelites who persecuted
[1:23:00] Isaac who was born
[1:23:03] first
[1:23:06] ishmail and when Isaac the son of
[1:23:09] Promise came along what did he do he
[1:23:11] hated Isaac he persecuted he said
[1:23:15] everything he could against Isaac watch
[1:23:19] that same
[1:23:20] Spirit okay
[1:23:26] in the sermon Christ The Mystery of God
[1:23:29] reveal and they're going to bring a
[1:23:31] persecution on pretty soon and shut up
[1:23:34] all the churches you see that and
[1:23:37] churches like this who is not a
[1:23:41] denomination they'll use them for a
[1:23:43] storehouse
[1:23:45] anything and if any man goes off and
[1:23:47] offer a prayer for anybody else that
[1:23:49] don't belong that ecumenical movement
[1:23:52] will be shot on the spot
[1:23:55] it's already Lutheran Ministry goes on
[1:23:57] don't make any difference what they say
[1:23:59] see that church will stand true in this
[1:24:02] light she she's already proved it back
[1:24:05] Yonder and she'll do it again in the Fe
[1:24:07] of everything it's the word of God and
[1:24:10] they all the ecumenical movements and
[1:24:12] everything else will be gone she is
[1:24:14] going to be there without spot or
[1:24:16] wrinkle that's right she'll stand there

[1:24:27] Gap tremendous and he said he he was
[1:24:31] talking about it's going to be her for
[1:24:33] she will be

[1:28:47] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[1:28:49] children of God blessed are they which
[1:28:51] are persecuted for righteousness sake
[1:28:54] for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:28:56] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[1:28:59] persecute you
[1:29:01] say all manner of evil against you
[1:29:03] falsely for my name's sake Rejoice me
[1:29:07] exceedingly glad for great is your
[1:29:09] reward in heaven thank you Lord hallu
[1:29:12] for so persecuted the prophets which
[1:29:15] were before
[1:29:17] you
[1:29:18] oh I am privileged and I am blessed amen
[1:29:24] beyond
[1:29:27] measure now let me touch on another
[1:29:30] subject this
[1:29:31] morning because it was something that
[1:29:34] came across in my life as an early
[1:29:37] Christian when I first came to this
[1:29:40] message so you kind of bear with
[1:29:43] me uh as I give a little bit of a wrap
[1:29:46] up again of my of my
[1:29:50] testimony as you all know I wasn't
[1:29:53] raised in a church
[1:29:55] my parents didn't take us to church
[1:29:57] Jesus
[1:29:58] Christ The Name of Jesus Christ was a
[1:30:01] cuss word in our
[1:30:03] family we had never gone to church the
[1:30:06] only time I had ever actually walked
[1:30:08] into a church was when my sister had
[1:30:12] gotten married and it was at a church
[1:30:14] and they had the ceremony because my
[1:30:17] parents had just Nar it wasn't my father
[1:30:19] kept saying ah these people these
[1:30:22] Christians
[1:30:24] he says look at those going into the
[1:30:26] church do they look
[1:30:30] happy I want to ask you how do you look
[1:30:32] when you go into church are you
[1:30:36] walking you are not going to sell
[1:30:39] anybody on what you got unless you're
[1:30:41] happy about what you
[1:30:43] got right you ought to have a zip in
[1:30:47] your step a smile on your face and be
[1:30:50] happy about what you believe amen I'm
[1:30:54] happy about what I believe I'm thankful
[1:30:57] to God that he opened my eyes and gave
[1:30:59] me understanding in this
[1:31:02] hour so all of the ones who came into
[1:31:05] the message at the same time that we did
[1:31:09] there in California came into the
[1:31:11] message by listening to tapes and I told
[1:31:13] you a brother found this at a swap meet
[1:31:15] and he wanted to buy this tape recorder
[1:31:18] the old real toore Woolen sack and the
[1:31:20] guy said okay you can buy it fine $25
[1:31:24] I'll take it he said under condition you
[1:31:26] have to take the tapes I don't want the
[1:31:28] tapes I just want the recorder no you
[1:31:31] have to have the tapes it goes along
[1:31:34] with it I don't want the what's on the
[1:31:36] tapes he said a preacher he said I
[1:31:39] really don't want it because this was a
[1:31:42] backsliding hippie druggy
[1:31:45] Jew he wanted nothing to do with
[1:31:48] preaching so anyway the guy said Hey
[1:31:51] listen come on man you have to buy tapes
[1:31:54] to record your rock music anyway record
[1:31:58] over it bing yeah so you know what he
[1:32:01] did okay yeah I'll take and just in
[1:32:04] curiosity yeah I wonder what this guy
[1:32:06] has to
[1:32:08] say good evening friends I greet you in
[1:32:11] then
[1:32:12] Lan this guy hears half a tape man his
[1:32:15] eyes come open he's so excited he
[1:32:18] started sharing it we had no idea where
[1:32:20] do who is we figured that brother
[1:32:24] brenham's name was Jeff from Indiana
[1:32:27] because that was on the side of the
[1:32:28] tapee sermon title and Jeff
[1:32:32] Indiana short for
[1:32:34] Jeffersonville well let me tell you we
[1:32:37] bunch of druggies hippies loudan Misfits
[1:32:42] City Slickers
[1:32:44] Surfers hey man none of us were church
[1:32:47] goers and we start hearing these tapes
[1:32:49] and let me tell you even as I told my
[1:32:51] wife
[1:32:54] this was we had been boyfriend and
[1:32:55] girlfriend and I had gotten away from
[1:32:58] the things of the Lord and she saidif
[1:33:00] you're not going to be a Christian I
[1:33:01] want nothing to do with you good for you
[1:33:04] Sisters You Learn by a mother like that
[1:33:06] in
[1:33:07] Christ so later I came to the message I
[1:33:10] said Sandy come over here I believe we
[1:33:12] found a prophet well she didn't hear
[1:33:15] anything that she just wanted to know
[1:33:16] what what what changed me so man we put
[1:33:20] on the tape and and
[1:33:24] we just bowed our heads and when brother
[1:33:26] Bram said let's pray we prayed and I'm
[1:33:28] saying oh God open her eyes and by the
[1:33:31] end of the
[1:33:33] tape I didn't have to say now you listen
[1:33:36] to
[1:33:38] me you know
[1:33:40] what that's it it's all it took because
[1:33:45] my sheep hear my voice and the stranger
[1:33:48] they won't fellow follow let me tell you
[1:33:50] there's something about this voice at
[1:33:52] the end time but in the days of the
[1:33:54] voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:33:56] should begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:34:00] would be finished thank you
[1:34:04] Lord amen yes sir we all started
[1:34:08] gathering together to listen to tapes we
[1:34:11] were part of those tape group in a home
[1:34:15] it's
[1:34:19] true one of the reasons was nobody had
[1:34:22] any money
[1:34:24] there was only one guy with a tape
[1:34:25] recorder and player and there was very
[1:34:28] few tapes so we said hey will you share
[1:34:31] what you got yeah so we all sat together
[1:34:34] and listen to these tapes and let me
[1:34:36] tell you there was such a
[1:34:38] desire listen we don't know what's going
[1:34:41] to come on the next
[1:34:43] tape LGH
[1:34:45] haired
[1:34:50] hippies brother brand said you know what
[1:34:52] kind of spirit is on him man with long
[1:34:54] hair is
[1:34:56] perverted I'm sitting there with my long
[1:34:58] hair yeah I'm
[1:35:04] going why did he have to say
[1:35:12] that and sheep desire to have Fellowship
[1:35:14] don't they brother Ram said you get out
[1:35:17] on your own he said that little sheep
[1:35:19] that wanders off by itself is just ready
[1:35:24] for the devil to come some old wolf to
[1:35:27] come along and get a hold of you you
[1:35:29] need
[1:35:31] Fellowship sheep must Fellowship
[1:35:34] together and sheep need a
[1:35:38] Shepherd we prayed ask God to teach us
[1:35:40] what we needed to learn we didn't know
[1:35:43] man I tell you all we did was just we
[1:35:45] were so sincere just to hear the word of
[1:35:48] God we and then one day um they had we
[1:35:52] found a tape list in one of the the
[1:35:56] boxes at tapes it was from Fred sofman

[1:35:59] Tucson and man as a young boy there was
[1:36:02] a tape there they said we got to get

[1:37:25] witnesses said I was
[1:37:28] there within
[1:37:30] weeks all of those we heard the tapate

[1:37:56] Exodus out of
[1:37:58] California where do we go what do we do
[1:38:01] we don't know we just go the group split
[1:38:04] up into two groups David McGary took his
[1:38:07] little group up to to Montana to a place
[1:38:10] called Mazula and there was a little uh
[1:38:12] family there called the vanoi family

[1:38:18] vanoi
[1:38:20] yeah stepen Julie yeah
[1:38:23] rodne eoi and here Brother David he
[1:38:27] brings his little group up there and our
[1:38:30] little group we just we went over and we
[1:38:32] were in Oregon in the wamt
[1:38:36] valley and here we are we're just you
[1:38:38] know and so the only thing we know to do
[1:38:41] is to get together and play the
[1:38:43] tapes so we went there in the first
[1:38:45] couple
[1:38:47] uh weeks that we were up there in fact I
[1:38:51] had testified to Sandy I said we're
[1:38:53] leaving California well where are you
[1:38:55] going and I said I don't know I think
[1:38:56] maybe up towards Oregon and so
[1:39:00] she with her girlfriend they went and
[1:39:03] left and they moved up to Oregon they
[1:39:04] moved into one of the families that had
[1:39:06] left with
[1:39:08] us but as the time goes on guess what we
[1:39:11] started getting more spiritual or God
[1:39:12] starts Opening Our Eyes praise the lord
[1:39:14] we start seeing and what brother Brenham
[1:39:16] said we did hey man if he said the Way
[1:39:19] Up Is Down we got rid of our bellbottom
[1:39:22] pants and of our hippie tie
[1:39:25] dye and we got rid of all of that stuff
[1:39:28] in fact we were thinking that if the Way
[1:39:30] Up Is Down let's should we brush our
[1:39:33] teeth and comb our
[1:39:35] hair cuz that's
[1:39:37] vanity I mean when you're sincere it's
[1:39:40] like
[1:39:41] Lord
[1:39:44] okay someone even told us okay it came
[1:39:48] along there was somebody I don't know
[1:39:50] how but somebody found out that somebody
[1:39:53] in the area believ the message and he
[1:39:55] contacted us and guess what oh man this
[1:39:58] guy was so spiritual he said hey take

[1:40:11] the tribe of Judah how do you know cuz
[1:40:14] the the toe next to the big one is
[1:40:16] longer than the big one so therefore
[1:40:18] that's Judah man I walked around without
[1:40:20] shoes
[1:40:21] for a week Judah right there such
[1:40:30] nonsense and we begin man hey people
[1:40:33] starts praying and fasting and seeking

[1:40:38] hear the tapes the more we hear you need
[1:40:41] to have a home Church you need to have a
[1:40:43] pastor you need to quit going from
[1:40:46] Pillar To Post you need to have

[1:44:12] nail and then clinch it okay
[1:44:18] so we came across all the time listening
[1:44:22] to tapes you ought to have a home Church
[1:44:24] you got to have somewhere you pay your
[1:44:26] tithe and your
[1:44:27] offering you got to have somewhere that
[1:44:29] you have a pastor to watch over you a
[1:44:31] live five-fold
[1:44:34] Ministry we become subject to a live
[1:44:40] Ministry the Bible says in Hebrews 10:
[1:44:44] 23- 2 let us hold fast the profession of
[1:44:48] our faith without wavering for he is
[1:44:51] faithful that promised and let us
[1:44:53] consider one another to provoke unto
[1:44:56] love and good works not forsaking the
[1:44:59] assembling of ourselves together as the
[1:45:02] manner of some is it was already in that
[1:45:05] day as the manner of some
[1:45:10] is huh but exhorting one another and so
[1:45:13] much more as you see that day
[1:45:16] approaching we kept reading about
[1:45:18] preachers and pastors and having a home
[1:45:21] church and we needed will lead your to
[1:45:23] ship so one day I asked a couple of the
[1:45:26] elders why don't we have a
[1:45:30] church let mean you know what this is
[1:45:32] what they
[1:45:34] said That's
[1:45:36] Heavy brother you got a Catholic Spirit
[1:45:40] on you like some altar boy we need to
[1:45:44] pray to get you delivered to this
[1:45:47] Catholic spirit because we're the
[1:45:50] church you see it ain't no bill building
[1:45:54] we're the church we're the called out
[1:45:55] one wow man I I went from thinking we
[1:45:59] ought to go to church and that's what
[1:46:01] the prophet said but now I'm cutting
[1:46:05] down so the next day you know what they
[1:46:08] said God told us to not share with you
[1:46:10] anything spiritual
[1:46:12] anymore you can't understand it so I was
[1:46:15] excommunicated from the group you know
[1:46:18] what that feels like we didn't know
[1:46:20] anybody in the message there was it was
[1:46:22] just us right several families that's
[1:46:25] all we knew in the
[1:46:27] message and boy I tell you what when
[1:46:30] somebody says we're not going to share
[1:46:31] with you anything any more
[1:46:35] spiritual but God was doing it for a
[1:46:38] purpose thank you Lord because I was
[1:46:42] telling them say what the prophet have
[1:46:44] said why are we not doing what he
[1:46:48] said so I was already as a young boy
[1:46:51] Discerning spirit
[1:46:54] okay have you ever met somebody let me
[1:46:56] just ask you you ever met somebody that
[1:46:58] say they're a Christian or there a
[1:47:01] message believer and their Spirit does
[1:47:04] not bear witness with yours you feel
[1:47:06] it's them and you you ever felt that I
[1:47:09] want to ask you what are you Discerning
[1:47:12] brother Brenham has them coming up
[1:47:14] during the time of the discernment they
[1:47:16] walk the angel was to the right come
[1:47:17] through here like this and brother
[1:47:19] brandham says now come close he says
[1:47:21] that won't hurt you that's his presence
[1:47:24] he says now I know you're a Christian
[1:47:26] because you have that welcoming
[1:47:29] Spirit oh God help me to have the right
[1:47:32] spirit amen I'd rather have the right
[1:47:35] Spirit and the wrong
[1:47:36] Doctrine that's what he said I'd rather
[1:47:39] have the wrong Doctrine and the right
[1:47:41] spirit because the right spirit is
[1:47:44] teachable
[1:47:46] amen
[1:47:49] so remember now I typed this sermon last
[1:47:53] night before a brother sent me what
[1:47:56] about what I'm about to read you on some
[1:47:58] stuff some because some people think
[1:48:01] that brother Brenham did not believe in
[1:48:03] going to
[1:48:05] church and they still believe that okay
[1:48:09] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:48:12] together now so
[1:48:14] 1964 in questions and answers watch this
[1:48:18] here brotherr and put it up there so
[1:48:19] everybody can read it brother Brenham
[1:48:21] should we go to other churches even when
[1:48:23] they disagree with you sure yep Jesus
[1:48:28] did when they disagreed with him go
[1:48:31] ahead we notice here should we go to
[1:48:34] another church that disagrees with you
[1:48:36] sure I'm not the only Pebble on the
[1:48:38] beach you know there's just other Godly
[1:48:41] men everywhere I hope I'm one of them
[1:48:43] amen a group in Arizona amazing he
[1:48:47] Arizona the Arizona's
[1:48:51] Troublemaker a group in
[1:48:53] Arizona but there's a Lex seed there too
[1:48:56] so a group in Arizona call my attention
[1:48:59] to that a ministerial group said the
[1:49:01] only thing we have against you brother
[1:49:03] brandom one of the
[1:49:05] things the people that comes out here
[1:49:08] with you we can't get them to go to
[1:49:10] church
[1:49:11] anywhere said they got children and
[1:49:14] everything and they won't go to church
[1:49:17] now I know they put pressure on you and
[1:49:19] want you to join but you don't have to
[1:49:21] join just put them kids in Sunday School
[1:49:23] somewhere and you go to church don't sit
[1:49:25] at home go fishing hunting and things
[1:49:27] like that on Sunday you say well I'm not
[1:49:29] a legalist you'd better be in the manner
[1:49:31] after that for a while dishonoring the
[1:49:34] resurrection of Christ you go to church
[1:49:38] somewhere if I went to a certain church
[1:49:41] I know there's only one thing them
[1:49:43] people ever said that I believe they
[1:49:44] said that g uh they believe Jesus was
[1:49:47] the son of God said that I doubt it but
[1:49:50] I would go to hear them say that maybe
[1:49:53] you say well that this church maybe the
[1:49:54] next church maybe something like the
[1:49:56] Baptist yeah I believe that you have to
[1:49:57] have an experience I'll go see and he
[1:49:59] goes on I'm going to go to the next
[1:50:01] quote paragraph 2113 CU I'm I'm I don't
[1:50:05] want to take too much time just reading
[1:50:07] and if an assembly Minister happens to
[1:50:09] pick up this tape I want to tell you
[1:50:13] when was I ever against the Assembly of
[1:50:16] God men or any other man why is that
[1:50:20] when your own headquarters admits I have
[1:50:23] sent to you 3/4 of a million of my
[1:50:27] children that I have begotten to
[1:50:30] Christ
[1:50:33] 750,000 of brother brenham's converts to
[1:50:36] Christ where did he send him Assembly of
[1:50:42] God let him keep reading or I
[1:50:47] will how am I against the Assembly of
[1:50:50] God why why am I Against the Oneness I'm
[1:50:53] not against no Oneness Assembly of God
[1:50:55] Church God or no man I'm against every
[1:50:58] system that separates
[1:51:01] man like I've sent to the assemblies by
[1:51:04] their own count three4 of a million of
[1:51:06] my own children if they're so bad why
[1:51:09] would I do that why I think the best
[1:51:12] there is in the land to send them there
[1:51:14] either the Oneness some the Pentecostal
[1:51:16] belief because they believe in Divine
[1:51:18] Healing they believe in Supernatural
[1:51:20] they believe in the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:21] Ghost that's the best I can't bring them
[1:51:24] all right here they're all over the
[1:51:26] world I got friends all over the world
[1:51:28] children I've begotten to Christ I'll
[1:51:31] send them to the best well why would I
[1:51:35] send them there then I would be a
[1:51:37] hypocrite to send my own children to
[1:51:40] death far be it from me no
[1:51:43] sir see two paragraph 25 if you can't go
[1:51:48] if you can't go here at the Tabernacle
[1:51:50] get some church somewhere go to do it
[1:51:54] yeah sure you go to church wherever you
[1:51:57] go to church door open you take off as
[1:51:59] hard as you can go if they don't believe
[1:52:02] that now you don't have to predate don't
[1:52:04] join them don't join any of them
[1:52:06] churches just go to them fellowship with
[1:52:08] them how do you know it's not the Lord
[1:52:11] and he said he'd make everything work
[1:52:12] together for the good and maybe there's
[1:52:14] a soul in there ought to be saved and
[1:52:16] you can Shine the Light to them go on
[1:52:18] down don't go arrogant go sweet and the
[1:52:21] people begin to say that's such a
[1:52:23] Christian woman and so on now let me
[1:52:26] address myself to the tape boys right
[1:52:28] now so you tape boys are listening you
[1:52:31] listen real careful sir cuz now I'm on
[1:52:34] your
[1:52:35] case and any of you ever typed in the
[1:52:38] tape boys in the message of the hour T
[1:52:40] type it in 25 quotes and the vast
[1:52:44] majority of the tape boys were Leo
[1:52:47] Mercer and Jean
[1:52:51] go did anybody know Leo Mercer and Jean
[1:52:54] go let me see your hand raise your hand
[1:52:56] if you did did you know him yes yeah
[1:52:59] sister Linda yeah brother Steve yeah I
[1:53:03] knew Jean Jean was a buddy of mine we
[1:53:05] spent time hunting together I never met
[1:53:10] Leo you tape
[1:53:13] boys I want to ask you who split the
[1:53:17] Tabernacle and took three4 of brandham
[1:53:20] Tabernacle and had a move to an area
[1:53:22] called Prescott
[1:53:25] Arizona and with the admission of those
[1:53:28] that followed Leo and Jean because they
[1:53:29] were Joshua and Caleb because brother
[1:53:32] Brenham was
[1:53:33] Moses and so you know what Moses saw
[1:53:36] into the promised land but it's not
[1:53:37] going to place you there we are Joshua
[1:53:39] and Caleb so you follow us and they got
[1:53:42] those Believers to burn their tapes and
[1:53:44] books of brother Brenham before they
[1:53:46] left you see what
[1:53:49] deception okay now they're not the only
[1:53:51] ones we got so many joshuas and calebs
[1:53:55] and Prophets of the hour and igh day
[1:53:59] Messengers we got all kinds and they're
[1:54:02] dividing the little I want you to
[1:54:03] understand a
[1:54:05] nickelonit divides and Conquer if I can
[1:54:09] get you split up if I can divide you if
[1:54:12] I can get you all staying home if I can
[1:54:14] get you there and it's just a Catholic
[1:54:16] Spirit it used to be that you could go
[1:54:18] light a candle in the Catholic church
[1:54:21] and say a prayer
[1:54:23] right if you was sincere God would hear
[1:54:25] you pray to St
[1:54:29] Christopher now you just press
[1:54:32] play you don't you don't have to pray
[1:54:34] you don't have to seek the mind of God
[1:54:36] you see what I'm saying it's just press
[1:54:39] play and he'll do your religious works
[1:54:42] for you and you sit home and you're not
[1:54:46] under a live five-fold
[1:54:48] Ministry you're just sitting there and
[1:54:51] you're not subject to
[1:54:53] nobody you understand CU nobody's making
[1:54:57] you accountable CU there is no
[1:55:00] accountability to those who stay home
[1:55:02] and press play but there is when you go
[1:55:05] to a church and you're under a five-fold
[1:55:07] Ministry and there is a ministry that's
[1:55:09] preaching and by the Discerning of the
[1:55:12] word by the spirit he is preaching and
[1:55:15] all of a sudden he's on your case how
[1:55:18] many of you can say it's happened to me
[1:55:20] in church the minister preaching and it
[1:55:23] had an effect he was right on me and
[1:55:25] nobody told
[1:55:29] him the spirit told
[1:55:34] him
[1:55:36] so 25 quotes on the tape boys most of
[1:55:42] them are about Leo Mercer and Jean gold
[1:55:45] but here is one but there must have been
[1:55:47] some tape boys slipped in somewhere to
[1:55:50] that predestinated seat slipped over to
[1:55:52] her house speaking of Rahab played some
[1:55:54] tapes and she made her own house at
[1:55:56] church to receive the
[1:55:58] message okay she made her house a
[1:56:03] church do you catch it you're supposed
[1:56:06] to be at home that's your
[1:56:09] church wait just a
[1:56:11] second he keeps reading but one little
[1:56:15] heart there must have been some tape
[1:56:16] boys slipped in there and played some
[1:56:18] tapes the predestinated seed caught it
[1:56:21] and B believed it somehow anyhow they
[1:56:25] got in there for a message they had
[1:56:27] church that night in her house she used
[1:56:29] her house for a church to receive the
[1:56:31] message listen I come through that yes
[1:56:35] sir I want to ask you she received two
[1:56:38] Messengers there wasn't a cassette that
[1:56:41] walked in
[1:56:42] there there wasn't a real toore there
[1:56:44] wasn't a
[1:56:46] book they had two
[1:56:49] Messengers what were they packing
[1:56:53] message because Joshua the destruction
[1:56:57] Angel is ready to come and take Jericho
[1:57:00] and she says you Messengers and you know
[1:57:04] this is amazing thing here's one of
[1:57:05] those questions I have what in the world
[1:57:08] are you two Messengers sitting in a in a
[1:57:11] harlot's
[1:57:13] house of every place that you go why
[1:57:18] there well God will answer that when we
[1:57:20] get over there but the only I can say
[1:57:23] she was predestinated to hear it and she
[1:57:26] might have been in a horrible condition
[1:57:28] come on now you understand she might
[1:57:31] have been all kinds of horrible things
[1:57:33] in her life but when those two
[1:57:35] Messengers carrying the Ark of the Lord
[1:57:38] over their hearts brother ramam said he
[1:57:42] never he never called in uh Mechanical
[1:57:46] Devices that's right to preach the
[1:57:48] gospel he called men God called men
[1:57:51] somebody say Amen to
[1:57:54] that
[1:57:57] right
[1:58:01] so let me address the tape boys as I
[1:58:04] told you just hang on right now and I'm
[1:58:09] I'm I'm about halfway so amen 1965
[1:58:15] brother Brandon preaches a sermon trying
[1:58:17] to do God a service without it being
[1:58:20] according to his will
[1:58:23] I think I'm so misunderstood and don't
[1:58:25] know why some people think I don't even
[1:58:27] believe in people going to
[1:58:29] church that's a million miles from the
[1:58:32] truth we must assemble ourselves
[1:58:35] together and that much more as we see
[1:58:36] the day approaching we must come
[1:58:39] together in unity if I lived in a city
[1:58:41] and they had nothing there but well some
[1:58:43] church I don't want to call any name but
[1:58:45] just any church they only believe one
[1:58:48] thing that Jesus was divine and the rest
[1:58:50] of it was wrong I go to that
[1:58:53] church if I can't get a whole loaf of
[1:58:55] bread I'll take a slice see I'll go
[1:59:00] listen Worship the Lord and show him I'm
[1:59:03] doing my part I want him to know I'm
[1:59:06] alive I want everybody to know what site
[1:59:08] I'm on I assemble with Christians and
[1:59:11] they worship and serve the and serve the
[1:59:16] Lord he said but watch now he says they
[1:59:20] live off the name of Christianity but
[1:59:22] they bear the wrong kind of fruit has
[1:59:25] denominational
[1:59:27] fruit they said a thing and they living
[1:59:30] right off of it living off the very
[1:59:34] life it's what I was trying to say last
[1:59:36] night that Spirit can be baptized into
[1:59:39] that spirit and still not be a
[1:59:42] Christian see you're living right off of
[1:59:45] the same life but the fruits you bear
[1:59:47] tells what you
[1:59:50] are that's right
[1:59:53] they can do all the signs pray for the
[1:59:55] sick heal the sick open eyes cast out
[1:59:57] devils and all these things right off
[1:59:59] from the same life that's there but it's
[2:00:01] still a lemon
[2:00:08] now so a brother sent me this this
[2:00:12] morning comes from the voice of God
[2:00:14] website
[2:00:16] honestly I think in my whole Christian
[2:00:19] Life I have not gone to voice of God
[2:00:22] website maybe three
[2:00:26] times because voice of God is not my
[2:00:31] absolute it's not my
[2:00:33] Mecca I'm not looking to the brandom
[2:00:36] family as my
[2:00:40] absolute okay so here it is have you
[2:00:43] guys you want to see you know what this
[2:00:44] is up here it's the countdown how soon
[2:00:48] we're having church and I want all of
[2:00:50] you at 12:00 Jeffersonville to come in
[2:00:55] and to listen to God's voice for this
[2:00:58] hour and I believe that's God's voice I
[2:01:02] do okay but it's the stuff that is being
[2:01:06] propagated right now I'm against I'm
[2:01:09] going to tell you and I may make some
[2:01:12] even be upset with me here so here it is
[2:01:15] this is a I'm quoting Joseph brandham
[2:01:18] right now dear hidden Mana eaters
[2:01:23] God sent his seventh angel Messenger to
[2:01:26] lead his bride not another man not a
[2:01:30] group of man but one man for the message
[2:01:32] and his messenger are the same God's
[2:01:35] word needs no interpretation he spoke it
[2:01:37] to his bride through human lips and we
[2:01:40] all believe just how he said
[2:01:44] it I say say all that the tapes say
[2:01:48] yesen don't take your selective quotes
[2:01:50] go from 47
[2:01:53] 65 we must be careful today what voice
[2:01:56] is leading
[2:01:57] us and what it's telling it it is
[2:02:00] telling us our very Eternal destination
[2:02:03] depends on that very decision so we must
[2:02:05] decide what voice is the most important
[2:02:08] voice we must
[2:02:09] hear what voice has been Vindicated by
[2:02:13] God what voice has thus sayith the Lord
[2:02:16] it can't be my voice my words my
[2:02:18] Doctrine but it must be the word thank
[2:02:21] you Joseph it must be the word
[2:02:25] amen not his
[2:02:28] words you understand not his voice but
[2:02:32] the word so he's even having to testify
[2:02:35] it's the word because the word of God is
[2:02:37] our
[2:02:38] absolute do you understand it that's the
[2:02:40] umum Thum today he says you want to know
[2:02:43] he says hey if a man is telling you the
[2:02:45] truth or not put it to God's arum Thumb
[2:02:47] from Genesis to Revelation if it don't
[2:02:50] light up it's false prophet
[2:02:52] right okay that's our absolute the
[2:03:01] Bible does it tell us that he will raise
[2:03:04] up the five-fold ministry to lead us in
[2:03:07] the end we can clearly see in the word
[2:03:10] they have their place very important
[2:03:12] place but does that the word say
[2:03:16] anywhere capital letters they will be
[2:03:18] the ones to have the most important
[2:03:20] voice that what we must here to be the
[2:03:24] bride do you do you understand what he's
[2:03:27] saying Prophet told us here there are so
[2:03:29] many men to rise up in the last days
[2:03:32] that will try to do God a service
[2:03:33] without being his will see he said his
[2:03:36] perfect will is and always has been to
[2:03:38] hear and believe his Vindicated
[2:03:40] prophet's voice for it it and it alone
[2:03:43] has thus saith oh Lord that's why he
[2:03:45] sent his Angel why he chose him he had
[2:03:48] it recorded it's spiritual food in due
[2:03:50] season hidden Mana to his
[2:03:52] bride seven out of The Seven Ages men
[2:03:55] esteem their word above mine you have to
[2:03:59] ask yourself that is this not happening
[2:04:01] Among Us right now don't play tapes in
[2:04:04] church but you must hear your pastor
[2:04:07] just play the tapes in your home he's
[2:04:10] quoting that Joseph said that they don't
[2:04:13] play place his voice on tape as the most
[2:04:16] important voice but their voice they're
[2:04:19] pointing the people to themselves and
[2:04:22] importance of their Ministry their
[2:04:24] calling to bring the word to the uh to
[2:04:26] lead the bride but the bride cannot
[2:04:27] stand for it they will not accept it
[2:04:30] they will not uh do it they will not
[2:04:32] compromise on it it's the voice of God
[2:04:34] or nothing else that's what de bride
[2:04:35] says now Paul said follow me as I
[2:04:39] follow thank you follow the word he said
[2:04:42] for I have taught you day and night for
[2:04:45] three years that after my departing
[2:04:46] shall come in Grievous
[2:04:48] wolves and they're not going to spare
[2:04:50] the flock going to eat you
[2:04:53] up
[2:04:55] amen I don't deny or question but some
[2:04:58] of the most influential ministers and
[2:05:00] the fivefold ministry in their rank says
[2:05:03] it's not the voice of God it's just the
[2:05:05] voice of William brandham others say the
[2:05:08] days of a oneman messes message are over
[2:05:11] and this message isn't the absolute is
[2:05:15] that who is leading you I want to ask
[2:05:19] you
[2:05:24] do you tape
[2:05:27] boys who are you
[2:05:30] leading what are you pointing him
[2:05:35] to say what he said yes don't take your
[2:05:39] little selective quote and say here you
[2:05:41] know and you know what yeah do do I do I
[2:05:45] say that there are not ministers that
[2:05:47] have preached for years had churches and
[2:05:50] big conventions and now they've left the
[2:05:52] message do I say that's not true no it's
[2:05:56] true it's
[2:05:59] true I can't deny that there's a there's
[2:06:03] quite a few that's left the
[2:06:04] message does that bother me no it
[2:06:07] doesn't the Bible says the end shall not
[2:06:09] come except be the a falling away first
[2:06:12] a great Falling
[2:06:14] Away
[2:06:18] amen so
[2:06:23] I want to ask you you guys know my M
[2:06:26] manner of speech you know what I teach I
[2:06:30] want to ask you do we play tapes in this
[2:06:35] church I've been really wanting to go
[2:06:37] back we haden't played it in a couple in
[2:06:40] several months but I want to do it I
[2:06:41] want to have a tape night I believe in
[2:06:44] it why do you think I put the quotes up
[2:06:45] there on the board for
[2:06:47] you so you know where he said it I don't
[2:06:51] see sit there and act like well I tell
[2:06:53] you what prophet God said you believe
[2:06:54] what this and then I add to it and take
[2:06:57] away from it no you go and the best
[2:07:00] thing for you to do is go back and
[2:07:01] listen to the tape
[2:07:03] yourself is that right all the way
[2:07:06] listen to all that he said not just a
[2:07:09] portion of
[2:07:12] it the question on people's mind today
[2:07:15] who did God choose to lead his bride the
[2:07:17] tapes or the five-fold ministry will the
[2:07:20] ministry perfect the
[2:07:23] bride will the ministry guide the bride
[2:07:26] according to God's
[2:07:27] word that has never been his way there
[2:07:32] are so many men today that have said
[2:07:33] they followed this message for years and
[2:07:35] years but they're now placing their
[2:07:37] ministry as the most important voice
[2:07:40] that you must hear but I want to ask
[2:07:43] you I'm I'm asking you you guys know
[2:07:48] me do I tell you
[2:07:51] that we shouldn't listen to
[2:07:54] tapes do we play tapes here even in this
[2:07:57] church and we study the message yes sir
[2:08:01] yeah just like we do the word of God
[2:08:04] okay because we want to rightly divide
[2:08:06] the word of God because God's going to
[2:08:08] hold me accountable and the thing that I
[2:08:10] like about when you go home and you
[2:08:11] listen to the tape and then you hear me
[2:08:13] preach and if I'm saying the same thing
[2:08:17] he said you're going to Amen brother Ron
[2:08:20] why I read that last night I heard that
[2:08:23] last night Amen brother preach it that's
[2:08:25] a
[2:08:26] true
[2:08:35] absolutely now which ministry will you
[2:08:38] follow which ministry will you place
[2:08:40] your Eternal destination on they say
[2:08:43] they're a call of God to preach the
[2:08:45] message I don't deny or question that
[2:08:46] some of these most influential ministers
[2:08:49] in the five-fold ministry ranks say it's
[2:08:52] not the voice of God it's the voice of
[2:08:53] William
[2:08:54] Brandon now here's here's where when I
[2:08:58] went to work for Brother
[2:09:00] Joseph he inherited a work that we were
[2:09:03] already doing spoken word
[2:09:06] Publications first office outside of
[2:09:09] Jeffersonville anywhere in the
[2:09:11] world and Sandy and I were asked by
[2:09:14] Brother Floyd Patterson who when Roy
[2:09:16] borders died at spoken word Publications
[2:09:20] he made Brother Floyd publisher and
[2:09:22] Brother Floyd asked my wife and I if we
[2:09:25] would go to Europe and we would help
[2:09:27] distribute the tapes and books of
[2:09:28] brother Brenham throughout
[2:09:30] Europe so we
[2:09:32] did then about 1986 or so there about we
[2:09:38] got there in
[2:09:41] 1984 uh Brother Joseph wanted complete
[2:09:44] control I want all of the printing
[2:09:46] operation and everything Fred sofman
[2:09:49] went ahead and gave him all of
[2:09:51] duplicating of the tapes and so now he
[2:09:55] inherited a work that we're already
[2:09:56] doing so he and brother Billy Paul come
[2:09:58] over to
[2:09:59] Europe and I knew them both I knew them
[2:10:02] by name they knew me by name but we
[2:10:04] didn't know one another on a real
[2:10:05] personal
[2:10:07] basis and so they came
[2:10:09] over and so they inherited a work and
[2:10:13] they took and they changed the name from
[2:10:15] spoken word Publications to voice of God
[2:10:19] Recordings which is still going today I
[2:10:23] should say it's a it's a building but
[2:10:26] they're not printing they're not
[2:10:28] duplicating what are they doing go
[2:10:32] there I went to the front door Daniel
[2:10:36] Andy says go up and it says it's closed
[2:10:38] due to remodeling you got to be kidding
[2:10:42] me I go up and I want to take a picture
[2:10:45] CU it's on a thing about this big 8 and
[2:10:47] half by
[2:10:48] 11 closed due to remont so I'm walking
[2:10:52] up to the front door to take a picture
[2:10:54] real close of it at the front door of
[2:10:56] voice of God Recordings and the door
[2:10:59] opens G I didn't know it's kind of a a
[2:11:03] mirror and I can't look through it oh
[2:11:07] brother Ron Peterson yes oh yeah you
[2:11:10] were the voice of God oh yeah you were
[2:11:13] from Germany yeah yeah oh my you know
[2:11:16] the Wizard of
[2:11:19] Oz excuse me I want to make fun of that
[2:11:23] but yes and and and here brother Daniel
[2:11:26] and sister Shannon are with us and and
[2:11:28] everything and and so finally he says
[2:11:30] well can we come into the forier oh yes
[2:11:33] yes come into the for so we go in there
[2:11:35] and they've got brother Brown's Pulpit
[2:11:36] the old Pulpit the one that was in the
[2:11:39] the flood that remember
[2:11:41] okay and uh no just look just look I
[2:11:46] don't want you to go behind it I don't
[2:11:47] want you to touch it it's just there
[2:11:49] this a you know
[2:11:51] hey that's fine listen I I don't need to
[2:11:55] touch it I don't need to get behind
[2:11:57] it do you do you see I mean see and then
[2:12:00] later we went to brandham Tabernacle I
[2:12:03] didn't ask brother Daniel take us to
[2:12:05] brandom Tabernacle but we were going by
[2:12:08] I went by we went by I wanted to see
[2:12:10] brother Billy Paul's
[2:12:12] grave because he's buried near brother
[2:12:14] Brenham and I wanted to see his
[2:12:16] gravestone we drove by I wanted to pay
[2:12:19] my respects because I love brother
[2:12:24] Billy but when he and Brother Joseph
[2:12:26] came to our
[2:12:29] office and he asked me to go to work for
[2:12:32] him I said okay I will but I said before
[2:12:35] I
[2:12:35] do I said I want to ask you Brother
[2:12:39] Joseph what do you believe about what
[2:12:40] your daddy said about you well brother
[2:12:43] Ron honestly I don't understand what
[2:12:45] daddy said about me on and on and I said
[2:12:48] if I'm going to work for you I want you
[2:12:50] to know how I see it because you know
[2:12:53] there's all these things you know
[2:12:54] brother R A Vision he's going to have a
[2:12:56] son he's going to be the prophet of and
[2:12:59] all this stuff I said okay I said
[2:13:01] according to scripture now I got Brother
[2:13:03] Joseph and brother Billy Paul sitting
[2:13:05] right I said according to scripture
[2:13:07] there's three kinds of prophets one is a
[2:13:10] major prophet and that's to an age and
[2:13:13] there can and will be other Minor
[2:13:16] Prophets right but there will be a major
[2:13:19] prophet to the louia and age and guess
[2:13:22] what he's already come I've already
[2:13:24] filled out brandom that hey your daddy
[2:13:27] got that spot so you can't be a major
[2:13:30] prophet is that right and the Bible says
[2:13:33] or excuse me the prophet of the hour
[2:13:35] tells us that a new testament preacher
[2:13:37] is a prophet yes so I said Joseph are
[2:13:40] you a you a preacher he rolls his eyes
[2:13:44] he said I'd have to get rid of half of
[2:13:45] my
[2:13:46] toys now I'm je
[2:13:49] hey now what I'm I'm saying I said with
[2:13:52] Joseph there so if he hears this he
[2:13:54] knows I'm telling the truth he knows
[2:13:57] I've never gone after them I love those
[2:13:59] men I said but I'm going to tell you
[2:14:02] just how I feel I said then the third
[2:14:04] one is a prophet like an un agabus you
[2:14:07] know what uh that is a man with a gift
[2:14:09] of Prophecy and he may only anoint him
[2:14:12] one or two times in his whole life to
[2:14:15] give a word right we're talking the book
[2:14:17] of Acts agabus so said you're not a
[2:14:21] major prophet you're you tell me you're
[2:14:24] not a preacher and you know what if
[2:14:26] Brother Joseph started preaching right
[2:14:29] now most of the people wouldn't know
[2:14:31] what to do with it you know why because
[2:14:33] he's been against
[2:14:38] preachers so he's in a real quandry like
[2:14:42] well should we have a church should we
[2:14:44] have a building should we get all the
[2:14:46] people
[2:14:49] together do you see when what I'm
[2:14:51] saying oh yeah I brother and and so
[2:14:55] again I told you I know and Sandy bear
[2:14:58] with
[2:14:59] me she knows sometimes I get a little
[2:15:05] rough most of all the ministry
[2:15:08] today say you should not listen to the
[2:15:11] voice of God's angel in the church only
[2:15:13] in your homes brother renham never said
[2:15:16] play tapes in church well first off
[2:15:19] that's not what we believe and another
[2:15:22] thing playing tapes never replace going
[2:15:25] to
[2:15:27] church somebody say
[2:15:29] Amen no I want you to listen to those
[2:15:33] tapes cuz that's God's voice to this age
[2:15:39] but let me throw a curveball to you the
[2:15:42] seventh angel is not the final
[2:15:48] voice there's one that comes after him
[2:15:51] right
[2:15:52] Revelations
[2:15:54] 10:8 but take the book and eat it
[2:15:56] because thou must prophesy who's the
[2:15:59] final voice to the final Age The Bride
[2:16:03] let me throw you another quote brother
[2:16:04] Ram said will the bride of Christ have a
[2:16:08] Ministry before the coming of the Lord
[2:16:11] yep sure uhhuh it's going on right now
[2:16:14] but it'll ever be so humble most people
[2:16:17] will Overlook it
[2:16:23] amen wake up people listen what these
[2:16:27] ministers are telling you these quotes
[2:16:29] are using to place their Ministry before
[2:16:33] the prophets How can any Minister be
[2:16:36] more important than to hear God's
[2:16:37] Vindicated voice that's proven that's
[2:16:39] has been proven and Vindicated that it's
[2:16:42] thus theth see I want to ask you see God
[2:16:45] never ordained mechanical devices to
[2:16:48] preach the
[2:16:49] gospel okay true ministry will tell you
[2:16:54] that there is nothing more important
[2:16:55] than hearing the word of God from the
[2:16:57] voice of God on
[2:16:59] tape they can preach teach or whatever
[2:17:01] they called to do but they must Place
[2:17:04] God's voice first but they're not doing
[2:17:08] it they're placing their Ministry first
[2:17:10] their actions
[2:17:12] prove well I want to ask you who closed
[2:17:15] the
[2:17:18] Tabernacle who has told all of the min
[2:17:21] to quit
[2:17:22] preaching who has said the only ones
[2:17:25] that should preach are the ones that
[2:17:27] will press
[2:17:29] play who said
[2:17:33] it it's okay it's
[2:17:39] okay last couple things here now if you
[2:17:43] all want to go you can go to today's
[2:17:45] voice of God recording and read the
[2:17:48] whole transcript of what Joseph is
[2:17:51] telling you you can read the whole thing
[2:17:54] you can discern it
[2:18:03] yourself ask yourself if brother Brandon
[2:18:05] was here today in flesh would he not
[2:18:08] have all the bride hook up to hear him
[2:18:12] all at the same
[2:18:15] time I want to ask you when brother Bren
[2:18:18] was here now I had a brother that went
[2:18:21] to my church in Silsby Texas his name
[2:18:24] was Bill Watkins Bill Watkins was under
[2:18:28] the ministry of Perry green and Perry
[2:18:29] green because Bill Watkins worked for
[2:18:31] mael which was the telephone company
[2:18:34] there in Texas he said hey you know
[2:18:37] you're a good technician will you
[2:18:40] divine U devise us a telephone hookup
[2:18:45] that everybody can call in from around
[2:18:49] wherever Arizona California he you know
[2:18:52] how brother Bram greets everybody but so
[2:18:55] Bill Watkins said yeah it's simple he
[2:18:57] took a bunch of old telephones put them
[2:19:00] together made a board gave it to Perry
[2:19:02] green Perry green gave it to brother
[2:19:04] brandham and they put it in the back
[2:19:06] room and so yes this morning God bless
[2:19:08] you I B I greet the church in in Phoenix
[2:19:11] the church up in Prescott those in
[2:19:13] Nevada or wherever he's just going on
[2:19:16] and on now I want to ask you see brother
[2:19:18] brandham do you think that he would
[2:19:20] would just say I want all of you to go
[2:19:23] and to just hear me on every
[2:19:27] Sunday he says if you have a home Church
[2:19:29] go to your home
[2:19:30] Church
[2:19:32] okay he would tell you that but you
[2:19:39] see so but what about the main thing are
[2:19:43] they using the quotes to tell you to
[2:19:45] hear God's Prophet is what you must do
[2:19:48] or their Ministry
[2:19:51] well I want to ask
[2:19:53] you as I got just two two quotes left
[2:19:57] here brother brandham said the final
[2:20:01] voice is not Revelations 10:7 he said
[2:20:05] the final voice is the
[2:20:07] bride it's going to be five-fold
[2:20:09] Ministry Ephesians
[2:20:11] 4 so what would you do with somebody
[2:20:13] that says I don't believe in Ephesians
[2:20:17] 4 would you discern the spirit sure
[2:20:21] would you judge it according to the word
[2:20:23] who denies the five-fold
[2:20:25] ministry cannot be of
[2:20:27] God you judge it because it's according
[2:20:30] to the word
[2:20:37] right so he says this is his last
[2:20:40] sentence here and those elect with him
[2:20:43] in that day will be the ones who truly
[2:20:45] manifest the Lord and be his body and be
[2:20:49] his voice and and perform his Works
[2:20:52] Hallelujah do you see it hey wait a
[2:20:55] second musicians if you come I want to I
[2:20:57] want to ask you this
[2:20:58] question those elect with him in that
[2:21:02] day will be the ones who truly manifest
[2:21:05] the
[2:21:06] Lord they'll be his
[2:21:10] body and be his voice wait a second you
[2:21:13] just said there's only one
[2:21:17] voice you're denying the very thing of
[2:21:19] what he said
[2:21:25] be his voice and perform his Works
[2:21:28] Hallelujah do you see it
[2:21:34] now one last scripture that I wish to
[2:21:38] share with you is found in 1 Timothy 4
[2:21:42] and7
[2:21:45] 1-7 now the spirit speaketh expressly
[2:21:48] that in the latter times some shall
[2:21:51] depart from the faith what is Faith
[2:21:54] Revelation giving heed
[2:21:56] to seducing
[2:21:59] Spirits doctrines of devils speaking
[2:22:03] lies and hypocrisy having their
[2:22:05] conscience seared with a hot iron
[2:22:08] forbidding to marry commanding to
[2:22:10] abstain from Meats which God had created
[2:22:12] to receive with Thanksgiving of them
[2:22:13] which believe and know the truth for
[2:22:16] every creature of God is good nothing to
[2:22:18] be re refused if is is received with
[2:22:22] Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the
[2:22:24] word of God in prayer and if
[2:22:26] thou put the brethren in remembrance of
[2:22:29] these
[2:22:30] things Thou shalt be a good minister of
[2:22:32] Jesus Christ nourished up in the words
[2:22:35] of faith and of good Doctrine whereinto
[2:22:37] thou has
[2:22:38] attained but refuse profane and old
[2:22:41] wives
[2:22:44] fables and exercise thyself rather unto
[2:22:48] godliness
[2:22:54] if thou put the brethren in remembrance
[2:22:57] of these
[2:22:59] things Thou shalt be a good minister of
[2:23:02] Jesus Christ all I do is put you in
[2:23:05] remembrance Timothy all he
[2:23:08] did was put him in remembrance of what
[2:23:11] Paul
[2:23:13] said
[2:23:15] now some of these things that I say here
[2:23:17] today and I'm you know I I love Brother
[2:23:21] Joseph I
[2:23:23] do I
[2:23:27] spent days with them traveling
[2:23:31] together go on bicycle rides go on walks
[2:23:33] in the forest with he and his
[2:23:35] wife go to his house for
[2:23:40] dinner I always wanted to see the inside
[2:23:42] of brother brenham's home i' never asked
[2:23:45] always went by the outside of the home
[2:23:48] there there's this seven over the
[2:23:51] doorway you can see it looks like it's
[2:23:53] seven kind of slanted the little roof
[2:23:57] but he said brother Ron why don't you
[2:23:59] and Sandy come and have dinner with us
[2:24:02] tonight yeah sure we went and had dinner
[2:24:06] the end of the story is this he said
[2:24:09] brother Ron I've never had anyone this
[2:24:12] is about
[2:24:15] 1986 he says I've never had anyone into
[2:24:19] my home for dinner
[2:24:23] I said Joseph you're
[2:24:27] kidding you've never had anyone over for
[2:24:32] Fellowship then I asked that
[2:24:34] multi-million dollar question why did
[2:24:36] you have Sandy and
[2:24:39] I why I'll never forget what he said cuz
[2:24:43] he said you treat me normal
[2:24:53] I bought him a gift one day in
[2:24:55] Rome we're in downtown
[2:24:58] Rome we were traveling
[2:25:01] together I bought him a
[2:25:04] gift told him I'll meet him downstairs
[2:25:07] at a certain time I went out and bought
[2:25:09] a gift he went out and bought his gift
[2:25:11] we came downstairs at the same time we
[2:25:13] both had a gift in our hands and he goes
[2:25:16] like this he puts it behind him I put
[2:25:18] mine behind him I said Joseph
[2:25:20] I said I didn't go and I didn't go into
[2:25:24] my room and rest I bought you a
[2:25:27] gift and I said Hey
[2:25:30] Joe I got you a gift because I like
[2:25:34] you not because your name's
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:43] brandom man the
[2:25:46] floodgates he said nobody's ever bought
[2:25:49] me a gift cuz they like me he says and
[2:25:53] they always say if you want to be good
[2:25:56] to me brother Brenham if you want to be
[2:25:59] good to me be good to my family he said
[2:26:02] nobody just gives me a gift for being me
[2:26:06] I said I love you Joe I love you for
[2:26:08] being you I accept you for being
[2:26:13] [Music]
[2:26:15] you do you know how
[2:26:18] hard it was would have been to be raised
[2:26:21] up in the family of brother
[2:26:23] [Music]
[2:26:27] Brandon and seen the fanatical
[2:26:31] issues and all of the
[2:26:35] things I told him I said Brother Joseph
[2:26:39] you're lucky to be in your right
[2:26:41] [Music]
[2:26:42] mind that's why I have a heart for Him
[2:26:46] and if Joseph if you hear this you know
[2:26:48] that to be the truth son you know when I
[2:26:51] disagreed it was you and I disagreeing
[2:26:53] it wasn't and I don't shoot at
[2:26:55] Jeffersonville that's not my intent this
[2:26:58] morning but something has
[2:27:00] changed one of the most divisive
[2:27:03] divisions within the message was a
[2:27:06] booklet that you all probably have in
[2:27:08] your home it's called here I
[2:27:10] stand and separated the tapes from the
[2:27:15] ministry and said that anybody that that
[2:27:19] prints a book it's stolen bread if it's
[2:27:22] not printed in Jeffersonville if the
[2:27:24] tapes are not duplicated in
[2:27:26] Jeffersonville they're not
[2:27:29] anointed so again I have the voice of
[2:27:31] God office so I I took a tape from
[2:27:33] Harold hilderbrandt and I took one that
[2:27:36] Brother Joseph sent me that was from
[2:27:37] voice of God in Jeffersonville I put it
[2:27:40] in the cassette player and I said okay
[2:27:42] all right you're spiritual tell me which
[2:27:44] one's
[2:27:45] anointed he said well that's not fair
[2:27:48] well stop quick playing this spiritual
[2:27:52] nonsense you just said it's not anointed
[2:27:55] you're spiritual tell me which one's
[2:27:57] anointed he said that's not fair the
[2:28:00] anointing is on The Voice I said you got
[2:28:01] that right I said I don't care who
[2:28:04] duplicates it or where it's
[2:28:07] duplicated it in the days of the voice
[2:28:10] of the seventh
[2:28:11] angel see what I'm saying
[2:28:14] Saints well we've we've had this change
[2:28:18] now and it's coming coming real strong
[2:28:21] right now from
[2:28:24] Jeffersonville who's got the ministry
[2:28:26] that's going to lead the
[2:28:28] bride is it the prophet is it fivefold
[2:28:31] Ministry let me tell you you know what
[2:28:34] it is it's the Holy Spirit keeping you
[2:28:37] away from all of the fanaticism and this
[2:28:40] side and that side it's not all the
[2:28:42] five-fold ministry it's not all the
[2:28:45] tapes it's right in the middle of the
[2:28:48] road and I stand for
[2:28:51] that and you all know you that have been
[2:28:54] with me for a long time Brother Andy
[2:29:01] Menard what do I stand
