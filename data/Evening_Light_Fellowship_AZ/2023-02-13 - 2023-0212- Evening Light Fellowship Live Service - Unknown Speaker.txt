For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name hey man amen amen God bless you uh all this morning thank you musicians each and every one I'd like you to turn with me two places of scripture turn with me to Leviticus chapter 23. Leviticus chapter 23 and First Corinthians 15. we welcome all of our visitors each and every one got so many different ones here brother Robert has welcomed all of you so I won't take that time amen and I do have a board meeting directly after service this morning so while I'm ending the service some of the sisters that are from the board if they need to slip out to prepare some things that would be fine now this is the first time that I have ever preached on just this one subject I referred to it throughout some sermons um and I chances are now I've never heard another Minister within the message this is me I don't get around a whole lot and I don't surf the Internet to see who's preaching what I'll probably get a note from brother Greg Alford that he preached this back in 1980 uh you know brother Ron come on man you're you're you know you're catching up son so um but I I want to preach about the wave sheep and uh it's been on my heart for quite some time and so Leviticus chapter 23 verses 10 through 16. now if you'll notice in Leviticus 23 this is labeling the feasts of the Lord the feasts of the Lord now we all know that they are a type and Shadow of Christ himself for he is those Feasts he is the word so when you speak of the Feast of the Passover it's Christ when you speak about Feast of first fruits it's Christ when you speak about feasts of Pentecost what is it it's Christ Hallelujah and so I've got an awful lot on my uh Fork this morning I will try to as best that I can get through it all I do have perhaps another Sermon Just on this subject but Leviticus 23 and verse 10 it reads speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when they become into the land which I give unto you and ye shall reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest I want you to notice he says when you get into the land so now they've already crossed over they're into the land and he says you shall bring a sheep of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest verse 11 and he shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you so this wave sheath has come to maturity first I'll give you some historical events in scripture about this but the reason that it is waived and it was waived according to Jewish Customs seven times seven times over the field showing the rest of the field what they shall become and he shall wave the Sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priests shall wave it and ye shall offer that day when you wave the Sheaf and he lamb without blemish the first year for a burnt offering all of these are symbols so we know that Christ is also the lamb and the meat offering thereof shall be two tenths deals of fine flower mingled with oil you find out this is the first time a double portion check this 210th so we see it's a double portion here of fine flower mingled with oil which also speaks of Christ an offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet saver and a drink offering shall be of wine a fourth part of an hen and ye shall eat neither bread nor parched corn nor green ears until the self same day that you brought an offering unto your God it shall be a statute forever throughout your Generations in all your dwellings verse 15 and you shall count unto you from the moral after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the Sheaf of the wave offering seven sabbaths shall be complete are we seeing a type here seven Church ages seven Messengers Seven Stars and it shall be completed there is a time brother Branham said look I no longer call you church I call you bright he's designating the time of God just dealing with the church it's over God is now taking even as John John come up hither and he got into the spirit amen this is our time this is our day this is our message Hallelujah seven sabbaths shall be completed even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall you number 50 days and you shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord notice that this wave sheath actually starts a countdown to Pentecost First Corinthians 15. First Corinthians chapter 15 verses 20. through 23. and now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for Since By Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive Hallelujah that ought to put a smile on everyone's face today notice now but every man in his owner his own order watch this Christ the first fruits afterward they that are Christ and his coming first fruits then everyone after that somebody say amen God bless you you may be seated may God add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated today in his presence and I pray that God will bless you richly abundantly opening to your understanding showing you another part of redemption I would like to title my sermon this morning the end time wave Sheaf has been waived over the field of laodicea I take a subject then the first one to come to maturity becomes the wave Sheaf I've always wanted to preach a sermon on the wave chief of the Old Testament and it's very interesting as I began to actually study this a couple days ago I began to not only research it through the scripture but I went to the message of the hour and I found out that he only preaches about the wave Chief in one sermon one sermon he gives about seven or eight quotes in one sermon about the wave sheep that is in the in the sermon it is the rising of the Sun and he allures to we're not talking about the s-u-n we're talking about the s-o-n and he's actually declaring there's a rising of a son of man Ministry what it is it's the son of man this is the day when the son of man shall rise with healing in his wings he shall bring you back to an inheritance that which Adam lost this second Adam Christ is returning you back [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah so all of these quotes I'm only going to use a few of them we will sprinkle them throughout the sermon and the first one in 1965 paragraph 81. I'd like to read a little scripture here for you I'd like for you to turn in the scripture I got it wrote down here I'm might help you a little has found the Book of Leviticus the 23rd chapter the 9th to the 11th verse listen close in the law levitical law God speaking to Moses listen all these things are types now and we'll stop here for a few minutes to get into this type and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying unto them when you come into the land which I've given you now watch he immediately goes to placing and positioning verse paragraph 82 under the place the position that I have given unto you I want all of you to know that each one of you are given a particular place and a position in the body of Christ there is none of you without exception but you must know and recognize your day and its message and when you recognize that you're actually understanding what position you play and where you're placed in that body Hallelujah now you speak to the children of it and when you get to this certain place that I promise you I take you when you get there in this land yeah now speaking natural here typing the spiritual and shall reap the Harvest thereof if you have received what I told you thereof then ye shall bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the Lord and He Shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it now let me just for a moment give a little background and I probably will refer to this in my next sermon but all of the feasts of Jehovah that are found in Leviticus 23. they are all shadows and types of Christ you can see it down through the scriptures and in ancient Israel to give you a little historical background the beginning of the Harvest of the grain and the waving of the first Chief that came to maturity was to be accepted by God as the first fruits of the Harvest crop this simple wave sheep has I want to say to you of great spiritual significance it is not a holy day it is not one of the feasts but I want to say this that although it may look obscure and a little bit in the background but without the wave sheath taking place none of the rest could happen why because God said you take the first fruit and you wave it over the field he said no one can go into Harvest nobody can eat of the grain nobody can do it until I see one that's come to maturity first Hallelujah so this is and may I say this that when you understand that the time clock to Pentecost it began to count down why oh my God help me preach this morning when you began to see the shadows and types in the scriptures when you begin to see brother Brown said God will open up your eyes of understanding and your Bible becomes a new Bible Hallelujah it's so easily Overlook the wave sheep offering only those aware of this wave sheep actually realize there's a countdown that begins to Pentecost it's only this only occurs one day a year the day of the wave sheath offering is not designated a holy day by God but it's far more important to you than you believe without its significance as to our Salvation there would be no salvation without the first fruits of a wave sheep the agricultural cycle of ancient Israel revolved around two harvests one was the spring Harvest and the other was an Autumn Harvest but before any grain could be harvested in the spring and unusual ceremony took place to inaugurate the spring harvest season what is the significance of this ceremony Jesus Christ being the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep it is the first sheep of grain that is called the first fruits in Leviticus 23 and 10. it was the firstfruits of The Barley Harvest the first of the grain that come to maturity and then we could fast forward to thousands of years later after they had been celebrating the wave Chief and and they've been celebrating the feasts of the Lord thousands of years later we see the same terminology being used and designated to Christ he is called the first fruits he is called the firstborn you see he is the firstborn from the dead he is the first to rise Hallelujah so what is the connection between the first grain offering called the first fruits and Jesus Christ the first fruits and first born from the dead this understanding will tie all of the elements of the two harvests mentioned earlier in the Feast of Pentecost oh my God and then to observe 50 days later the conclusion of that which began with the wave sheath it will finish with a release it's a jubilee 50. is it you believe Hallelujah seven Church ages Seven Seals seven trumpets all of these things are only a type and Shadow of what's Happening even in this day God give us an understanding so the observance of the wave sheath concludes 50 days later and ends with the final Harvest Pentecost was the harvesting of the rest of the grain it is called the final Harvest now we can clearly see that the same thing happens again in the days of Christ Jesus Christ became the wave Sheaf that was cut down at Calvary only to be raised up in the resurrection and waved over the field I want to tell you who raised him up God raised him up here was the wave sheath I am the way the truth and the life [Applause] no man takes my life I lay it down for my sheep and where I go you're gonna be with me and when I do you're gonna do and the same baptism I got you're gonna give [Applause] that started the time clock for another Harvest to take place 50 days later Jesus Christ was the wave offering over the elect to show them also that they too will become manifested sons of God on the day of Pentecost it was the harvesting of the seed again Jesus Christ harvested watch this when he rose he harvested all of the Old Testament Saints he gathered with him can you say Amen what was he doing harvesting seed Hallelujah and he was he went down into hell lift up your head so ye gates huh for the Lord is called who is this Lord of Lord who is it the Lord Of Glory Mighty in battle let me tell you my brother my sister we have just begin to fight in this end time we shall overcome and we shall possess the Gate of every enemy hey hey you have an inheritance you have a promise Hallelujah [Applause] the Holy Spirit watch this now release the power unto the New Testament Saints so God harvesting Old Testament and releasing them but now the holy spirit's releasing power to New Testament Saints my on Pentecost we're taking back now to the Feast of Pentecost there was offered from the first fruits of the wheat Harvest which followed seven several weeks after the barley Harvest and it there were two Harvest periods though two periods of physical harvesting in ancient Israel and I want you to catch this in your spiritual understanding in God's great plan for salvation of humanity this astounding truth is shown through the symbolism of the wave sheep first and then at the day of Pentecost now in the scriptures we see many types and shadows of this but I only want to take a few to rehearse in your ears this morning now the waves heave consisted of an Omer of barley that's a measure of barley it was still on the stock and it was cut down at the beginning of the spring Harvest since it came from the very beginning of the Harvest of first fruits it is called the first of the first fruits according to Exodus 23 verse 19. now I also did some study about this wave Sheaf and found out in the book of Exodus chapter 23 and chapter 34 Leviticus 23. and Nehemiah chapter 12. that it was a a commandment given to each Israelite possessing a harvest was required to give God an offering and then that priest then lifted or waved each Sheaf before God for acceptance it was to signify that the rest of the field will become exactly as the wave sheath listen to me it signified for your account that you shall become what the wave sheath became Hallelujah and so listen to this because however the individual Israelite Farmers used to bring each one of their own little wave Sheaf but we find out during the time of the second temple what it was is the high priest went out himself into the field Hallelujah he gathered because there is a part of the field every farmer knows this that though you plant acres and Acres of some kind of seed there'll be a portion of that field that will for some unknown reason it comes to maturity first and the high priest walks out into that field Hallelujah he begins to look for fruit of a matured field he begins to look for that grain that has come to its maturity brother Branham said it's not arrogant it's not boastful it's proud he said it when you are full of the Holy Ghost and knowledge of God you bow your head in humility [Applause] this high priest then came and he cut down a stalk a portion of this he called it a sheep and he took that he bounded together and he took it seven times he waved it over the congregation he waved it over the field for them to realize Hallelujah that there is an example of the example Hallelujah can you say we've had an example in this day [Applause] now watch the wave sheave actually sets the stage it sets a precedent for what the rest of the Harvest will become in fact according to levitical law the Harvest could not actually begin to fully ripen until the wave sheep offering occurred those scriptures specifies the day for the wave sheep to be cut there was no specific time for it to be cut now I'm going to Jewish history now to substantiate something during the time of the second Temple it's very interesting to note that the sickle of the high priest that cut the grain was just as the sun was going down on their weekly Sabbath showing how Christ our first fruits of the Harvest was cut down the evening they were in a hurry why Sabbath was coming do you see he was cut down in the evening Hallelujah now the Bible nowhere indicates that the priests fully understood the ritual they were performing on Saturday would be a precedent for the final Harvest on Sunday morning as the firstborn of many Brethren he was lifted into the heavens to God's Throne to be accepted for you as a sacrifice for your sins Christ was a first seed grain to become ripened he was the first one to come maturity he was a fully adopted son this is exactly corresponding now throughout several places in the scripture I'm going to refer to it though later we may read how about the time of Boaz and Ruth they came together events transpired at the time of The Barley Harvest and Boaz is known of the king of harvest the offering which was waived according to Leviticus 7 30. was the most likely a small Sheaf of barley the grain which is the first to ripen then was to be offered later in the loaves at Pentecost so the two offerings show here watch this Stay With Me Now for a moment the two offerings show one at the beginning of the Harvest and the other at the end of harvest let me show you this in the scripture Ruth 1 verse 22. so Naomi returned and Ruth the moabitus her daughter-in-law with her returned under the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of the barley Harvest this was the first fruits so it is at the time of the wave sheath being waved over the fields in fact was it not in the field of Boaz that Naomi has told we have a kinsman redeemer and I want you to go and I want you to glean in his field the handfuls of blessings she is gleaning is after the first fruits in fact it's commanded leave handfuls for those that will come into that field later and hear I'll tell you it just Thrills my heart she winds up getting handfuls of blessings she gets oh she gets a portion she comes back to Naomi Naomi goes my where did you get this oh my she says there was one his name is Boaz Hallelujah and she Roots fell on her face before Boaz it says why do you speak so kindly to me a stranger because it has been told me and fully revealed go read it in your Bible it's been fully revealed to me that thou art highly favored and God wants to give you a reward of the House of Israel [Applause] oh yeah She lays herself down you know the story at the end because Naomi says the same one he's your Kinsman and I want you to find where he's working because he's down in the threshing floor she goes down finds him She lays At His Feet assign him possession covers herself With His Garment oh yeah he waits who art thou I am thy handmaid amen and he tells her he says I shall truly perform the work of a kinsman redeemer you stay here until the rising of the Sun and when you see the sun rising are you catching the types and the Shadows Ruth 20 excuse me Ruth chapter 2 verse 23. she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean onto the end of barley Harvest and of wheat Harvest and to dwell with her mother-in-law so we see the beginning of the Harvest and the end of harvest to harvest are you catching it amen Ruth cleans in the field of Boaz and finds her handfuls of blessings that are left over from the first harvest when we understand the types and shadows of what happens with Ruth we'll understand what's happening with us now Ruth are you listening Ruth are you here do you understand stay here At His Feet stay where he tells you to stay stay in the promised word of the hour Romans 8 verses 19 through 23. for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God all of nature is groaning it's in travail brother Brennan preaches birth pains and he says what is the world this world wanting what is it looking for manifestation of the sons of God are you listening Sons understand that this world is wanting to be delivered and it can't be delivered until God manifests his sons on the Earth [Applause] for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him hath subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation growneth and travaleth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit amen you catch his first fruits watch it's always type Shadows even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wed the Redemption of our body there must be in this day then a return to the church another wave Sheaf before there can be releasing of a bride in an end time Harvest there has to be a wave sheep over the field at the beginning of harvest season and then a second the wave sheep was a sign that God was giving it to the rest of the field follow along with me it is the rising of the Sun notice it was the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead God's first corn of wheat by God's quickening power God had quickened his life raised him up from the dead he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that Chief that's why they had to wave that chief for it was the first one to come to maturity and it was waived as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign Hallelujah the wave sheep is a sign are you understanding that when Christ was raised up it was assigned to the rest of the field this is what you shall become what I am you will be the works that I do shall you do also where I go you'll be there with me [Applause] praise thank you Christ our high priest has waved another sheep over the end of this Gentile dispensation the wave sheep waved over the field of this loud you see an age Prophet first one to come to spiritual maturity his ministry was waived over the world seven times testifying to this age what spiritual maturity looked like the way of sheep was weighed by the high priest seven times over the field watch what he says 1960 he says I'm just going to read the highlighted portion how he would send me out in the field the field is the world seven times around the world how would he do that and let millions of souls be won if I didn't have some side of connection conception of truth how would he let me do these things the signs that he said he would send in the last days and we've never ever seen them or read them in history before since the Days of Our Lord why would he let me bring a message like this if I'm wrong he will never bless a lie he lets me bring it because I preached this is the truth this is the way Hallelujah if you believe me to be God's prophet I don't say that of myself he became me fully manifested son and adopted son he was knighted into his position at Sabino Canyon the sword was placed into his head he thought his ministry was over it was not over it was just starting his ministry was Rising the crowds were fewer but the ministry was greater God does this for a purpose he sends the chef the Chuck why it's the threshing floor and then there in sunset Mountain he's raised up into a cloud he's under the influence of seven Mighty Angels Wings swept back powerful Angel they came from eternity how elujah he sat there I was caught up into a consolation of angels but a sign what is it it's a wave sheath caught up caught up before oh he said they checked a picture of it we didn't do it [Music] notice the title of this sermon it is the rising of the sun if there would be any holy ritual it should come forth on the Sabbath day which is the seventh day of the week which is Saturday but did you notice in this Memorial to wave it on the first day of the week the Sheep which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripen you cut down the Sheaf and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the Lord for your accept exception that you are accepted you have come with your sheath and he is to wave it before the Lord not on the Sabbath the seventh day but on the first day which we shall call Sunday then he s-u-n-d-a-y he says what it's not Sun s-u-n anymore s-o-n-d-a-y what is it not a man he's now changing his ministry and yet the brother Brenham said is it so hard for you to understand I'm a son of man but I'm revealing to you the son of man it's not me that does each works it's him [Applause] foreign it's the s-o-n-d-a-y the Sunday that that corn of wheat God's first one up from the dead is to be waived over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first seed of those that slept waved upon the first day of the week on Sunny he raised up waved goodbye let's send it up on high in the presence of the people is this not the Fulfillment of Luke chapter 17. as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot wherein the son of man shall be revealed Hallelujah this is the son of man Ministry according to Luke 17 30. brother Branham said this day is this scripture fulfilled it's not brother Branham listen to me it was not brother Branham doing these Works he was a fully manifested son and it's the word that third pool which is the word revealed in its season and he says when it's revealed he could not stop it it was emanating from him nature sought the the possum sought the deer saw it even though the people missed it but nature even nature was saying are you Adam are you the one you pray for me you speak to me you tell me I'll be all right you lay on the doorstep for three days and the prophet missed it but the holy spirit said aren't you catching it that little animal has waited for you to pray for it [Applause] here is a manifested son coming into his fullness of adoption to where when he speaks he creates when he speaks storms go back when he speaks diseases go away when he speaks children got to come forth come on he can't happening amen because the son of man is Christ anointed once at the end time watch this you might have thought today I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than a voice and my voice against my own better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and determine to do hold that thought there for just a moment brother Branham says you know what this third poll it means that I there's a whole lot of shaking there's a whole lot of death to self and he says and I I I I can't go back to for first and second pull it's over and he says uh but he was determined to do the will and just as Jesus said let this cup pass from me nevertheless let thy will be done when brother Branham now listen to me here is the wave Chief in this day realizing that he's going to be excommunicated from all of the church's doors are going to close people are going to call him an antichrist all kinds of things and he made a decision I'll go the hard way I actually wanted to choose to to maybe title the sermon choosing the harder way foreign understand every one of you just as he had to choose the harder way and remember when it came out in French three is a witness he had just made this choice I'll go with him the harder way I don't care what men say I don't care what people think I'm gonna go with him I've chosen the harder way and God letting his Prophet know here it comes with three interpretations because thou has chosen the harder way which is my way a great reward a great portion of Heaven awaits you he says I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things four tells these things it happens as perfect as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's just what I surrendered myself too that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was a manifestation of the son of man it was the it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery of God unfolded it's not a man it's God the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man this was not William branham's message this was the message that came from almighty God himself oh man amen amen I had a disagreement with Brother Joseph when he came out and said this message is copyrighted and anybody that copies it or anything like that it's stolen bread you remember the the little booklet here I stand I told him I said since when can the word of God be copyrighted I said if this was your father's message you have every right for every royalty but I said change the name it ain't the voice of God it's the voice of William Branham and you can get every royalty and you can charge so much money and you can become rich I said but you better change the name I said because the name itself the voice of God I said how dare you think that you can copyright the voice of God these messages began to listen Roy borders gave out millions and millions of books free of charge Amen to people all over the world in fact when they started making tapes brother Brown said if these men who make these states start making money I'll take it away from them he said if you can't afford to have a tape he said I'll give it to you free Hallelujah you can't copyright what God has put his label on [Applause] yes I know that's not popular but that's okay now I believe that God is working amongst the church globally right now it's not just here local don't think that it's just us and God is it's just our little no when you begin to look around the world you will see God is doing something internationally globally he's doing it in Africa he's doing it in India he's doing it in all the different countries around the world what is it God is orchestrating a final move why because the wave sheep has been waived over the congregation and there's coming another Harvest [Applause] thank you it's the chef have you noticed in the last several years the different ones and this one going away that one going away this pastor and that Pastor in this congregation and this person what is it the shock this is not air with the weed do you know that at the time of the Harvest after the wave chief has been given and they begin to harvest the field then it's the time of the threshing floor if you've been into some of the poorer countries I've been to Africa I've been to India I've seen oxen treading the wheat going around in a circle they put their sheaves there and they do it what is it I've seen it in India where they didn't even have the ability to separate the wheat they had no way to do the term so what they would do is put their wheat on the the on the road and as the car would go by it would put the pressure of the tires over it and then as it went by speeding by they began to separate the chaff from the wheat and they would go out there and gather the grain oh I've been in Canada I've rode in the great combines where they sit there and they combine it just sits here and it's cutting it off and it puts it all together and but before Hallelujah if you've ever followed the combine there's something from behind it what's happening as the grain goes up and before it goes into the bin it has the roughest time of its life why do you think it's so hard right now God is taking the shot he's taking the chef that's in your life he's rubbing it together he's beating it and before the grain can go into the hopper he goes through a time of turbulence it's a separation time this is the threshing floor time this is God did not John the Baptist said his hand his fan is in his hand and he's thoroughly purging the floor [Applause] four four five first Peter 4 verse 17 and 18. for the time has come the Judgment must begin at the house of God threshing florist judgment threshing floor is the type of the house of God is Thoroughly purging his threshing for it's a time of judgment in turmoil when you thresh the wheat you beat it you tread it with oxen they do whatever it takes to cause a separation God will use bad things to produce good because the Bible says in Romans 8 28 for all things somebody say all things we'll work together for the good who are the called according to his purpose are you cold then everything that comes across your path will God use it then for his glory didn't say it would be good but it'll produce good Hallelujah church is on the threshing floor right now John 3 verses 16 and 17 John answered I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose and he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and will gather the weed into the Garner the chef will burn with on fire unquenchable God Purge those things out of our lives that are not like him how many of you are willing to say God Purge me show me in my life the things that are not same thing's happening today God is purging the church right now there's such a thing as doing God a service without it being his will David placed the word of God upon a new car the prophet of God said it looked like a real Revival he danced before the ark he did all of that the trumpets and they sounded in the temporals and he says but then when the oxen came the Bible says and when the ox cart came to the threshing floor right it's not only what happens but where it happens so they came to the threshing floor of chidin and The Oxen stumbled and uza poor uza poor uza he was just trying to do with maybe his King told him to do watch over that Ark and the Bible says in the ark wavered and he put his hand to the ark and when it did it says the anger of God slew him can you imagine and David's oh my God how can I bring the Ark of God you see if God would have allowed David to bring it on a new car it would have broke oh scripture it was not to be carried on an ox car it was to be placed over the shoulders of the Levites that that's where the word is carried today it is the ministry Hallelujah to carries the burden of the word over their shoulders and the sermon the angel of God 47 watch this God could have sent an angel down he could have let the angel come himself but instead of that he sent the angel to speak through the voice of a man God always used man for his word is that right he doesn't use organization so forth mechanical devices he uses amen the Holy Spirit fell upon men that's God's instrument here on Earth saints of God that's the saith the Lord he's the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change his program 1950 three years later he picks it up again God doesn't fall upon mechanical devices God the Holy Spirit fell upon men is God's agent and the hardest thing that God has ever had to do was to get one mortal to believe another that sermon title is God in his people then two years later greater than Solomon is here he always used man God doesn't use Machinery mechanical vices he uses men individuals excuse me I didn't mean to holler that loud notice I I'm not excited though I know right where I am then he picks it up a year later God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same notice what he done he brought forth the child a simple human being he could have ordained the son wanted to deliver them he could have ordained the wind to deliver them he could have ordained an angel to deliver them God can do whatever he wants to do well how do you know that brother Branham God won't leave his program that's the reason we know that this day has got to be simple now he always works in Simplicity but God in the beginning that could have made the son to preach the gospel or when spirits of gods were an angel to preach the gospel but he ordained men for that purpose he never changes it he never ordained groups of men ordained men to preached he ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery mechanical device or any Angelic being it was a man and when he brought deliverance from the people down there he sent a simple human being born of a simple family and a bunch of slaves I want you to understand when God sent a savior to the world he sent a son for God so loved the world he sent his only begotten son showing he will always use science God never changes his program the message listen to me now be careful here cannot distribute itself a tape doesn't walk into the jungles of Guyana on itself you ever seen a tape go or the books they don't go by themselves they're carried Who carries them amen God it's just still still his program how about brother Bassel there in Guyana he's a fishing captain he's out one day and he's got a whole load of fish that's worth lots of money sees the Pirates off the coast of Guyana they're going to take his catch and probably kill him and and throw his men overboard or something so he says Hey guys gather your nets load everything up let's go Full Throttle ahead and he goes and his boat just barely outruns the pirate boat he goes up a river he goes up into a river he finds a channel on the river and he just goes in there and guess what he runs out of gas he's out of gas man God had it for a purpose because the pirate both stopped turn her engine on listen for his Indian he disappeared and guess what two of the Amera Indians in a canoe they come paddling by hey he begins to talk to him they say he says hey do you have some gas I need gas in my boat yes they talk a little bit uh he tells him he's a Christian Pastor oh you're a pastor would you come preach in our village yeah brother Bassel runs away from Pirates runs out of gas two guys say would you come preach he goes and preaches in the village and guess what the whole village gets converted do you know the pastor can't even read do you know he has memorized the Bible by somebody reading it to him Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God he preaches because he remembers it is written he can't read it himself but it's in his mind let me tell you Thy Word of God have I learned to hide it in my heart that I learned not to sin against you how did those taping books get there they don't get there by themselves it's been as it's been in every age it's been the Levites ministry will carry the burden of the word over their shoulders because that's over their heart in trying to do God of service watch watch going by the priests by going to theologians by going to military forces and not even considering their god-sent messenger of the hour Nathan they did it wrong they went picked up the ark and put it upon a new card put it upon a new card a new denomination starting up not upon the god-given ordained way to pack it was supposed to be packed on the shoulders of the Levites but you see when you start wrong you keep going wrong trying to do got a service paragraph 124 Levi's shoulders was God's original way to do it if you press play and don't obey you have put the word on a new Ox card don't interpret it say what he says God give us more men with a calling of God called God ordained God placed man within that take the word of God upon their heart First Corinthians 13 I'm bringing this to a close now and They Carried the Ark of God and a new card on the house of abinadev and uzen draved the cart and David and all Israel played before God with all their mind and with singing with Harps and with sultries and with timbrels with symbols and with trumpets When They Came Upon unto the threshing floor of China wow who's that put forth his hand to hold the ark and The Oxen stumbled and the anger of the Lord was kindled against uza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before God brother Brown said one of the last place to hit the earth is spiritual death if it was spiritual death to put your hand to the word of God without a call of God on your life it's spiritual death to this day amen now watch this I'm I I'm gonna bring this to a close for right now we know that Israel is God's chosen land is that right we pray for Israel now the center of the world is Israel and the center of Israel is Jerusalem in the center of Jerusalem is the Temple mount and the center of the Temple mount is the holy of holies did you know the prophet of God said that the same altar that Abraham went to sacrifice his son Isaac he said it's the same place that is the heart of the center of the Temple mount it is the holy of holies and the Jews are not even allowed to go to the Temple mount can you imagine it's their land it's listen and and it says and watch that this Temple that is there it's called the mosque of Omar it's a temple of abomination there's coming a a day Hallelujah when God's going to change all of this Hallelujah and he's going to bring Israel why do you think Israel is gathering together why do you think they're going back to the Homeland why do you think these uh Messianic Jews or are talking about wow and we can see we can see some of the things happening oh my Messianic Jews what are they doing God's letting the blending over period the times of the Gentiles just about over so Israel's getting ready they're ready to to receive their two prophets but the two prophets Moses and Elijah cannot come on the scene until the bride goes up how close are we Hallelujah I believe we're right there my brother brother my sister we have seen the wave sheep who was it a prophet of God the first one to come to maturity and waved over the congregation several times to show you what you will become musicians come right now right now the reason we're having all kinds of turmoil and different things happening even within the body is because God is purging the floor he is he's purging your life as well as he did the prophets and when the prophet humbled himself and said I'll not take the easy way I'll I'll choose the harder way I'm going to say this to all of you whether you belong here or anywhere else if you're part of his it is now the time to consecrate yourself and say God I consecrate myself I sanctify myself I will choose the harder way because God is fixing to do something right now and you better be ready you better be in that position and if you're not there you say oh God be merciful to me let me choose right now you can do it while you're sitting in that chair I don't need to have you to have an altar call the altar's in your heart maybe you're not living the way you should you're not doing what you should and you wonder why all this turmoil and this upheaval that's happening all around you and why oh God why [Music] be exceedingly glad and rejoice When Trials come your way which which one of us said oh God God thank you I Rejoice for this trial
