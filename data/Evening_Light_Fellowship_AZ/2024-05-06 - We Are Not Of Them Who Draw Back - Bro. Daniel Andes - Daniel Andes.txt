said she woke up this morning and had a dream that she was singing that song Amen we just have to move as the spirit moves amen amen true believe it Jesus said the wind bloweth where it listeth you don't know where it came from or where it's going you just got to move brother Amos when the wind blows and the Holy Spirit is moving here this morning say Lord Breathe on Me amen Jesus stood with his disciples and he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a prophecy that a few days later he was going to come on the day of Pentecost I say Lord Breathe Again on us today how many have a need in your life you'd like to raise your hands we're a needy people amen oh if he'll breathe on us he's a Healer amen he's a savior he's a deliverer he's all that we need is in Jesus Christ

feel the presence of God moving out Lord You're a God that doesn't know space or Time Lord You're the eternal spirit of God and I pray you'd move over every one of us Lord take these words Lord the sacrifice that I've made to steud and prepare I pray the Holy Ghost would come upon it Lord and would speak to us in a special way we need you Lord Jesus we're asking Lord that you would come by and do something special for us today it just wouldn't be another service but it would be the Lord Jesus visiting our little assembly here today bless us now Lord bless brother Ron and sister Sandy Lord strengthen them today we ask in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 10 I want to read two verses and then we'll come back and preach through these verse number 38 Hebrews 10:38 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back un predition but of them that believe to the saving of the souls I want to take a thought this morning we are not of them that draw back that's right we are not of them that draw back may God add his Blessing to the word you may be seated amen I was thinking about something the other day and I want to go through this chapter I want to go back just a little bit to verse number 10 because sometimes in our message sometimes things uh you know and we have to go back to the basics of what we believe and I was thinking of verse number good to see you brother Patterson sister Patterson God bless you over 20 years ago he came to our church and he preached that God will make you the head and not the tail God wants to bless your life I remember that it had an impact on my life don't believe that the words that you speak don't echo on through eternity and affect people's lives amen may God help us brother Ron every sermon you preached had an effect amen every prayer you've prayed the Bible says the effectual F come on somebody the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much don't listen to the devil said it hit the ceiling and it came back down when God's word says it's very effectual and it's having an effect brother Russell every prayer that you prayed out on the trail God heard it and God remembers it Cornelius the angel come to him and said your prayers have been heard and they've come up before God as a memorial amen and we're not of those that draw back verse number 10 cutting right into the middle of this chapter said by by which we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all I'm here to tell you that our Salvation comes from Jesus Christ it does not come from a man does not come from a church does not come from the ministry does not come from William brandom it comes from Jesus Christ Alone why do you believe that brother Daniel because the Bible says so the Bible says so we need to get back to our foundations and roots that we are made nigh to God by the blood of Jesus Christ is that scripture then Ephesians and Colossians verse number 14 for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness the Holy Ghost should be a witness to you amen that he Sanctified you that he's done a work in your life it's just not something in your head but God will send back the witness of the Holy Ghost that he's accepted your sacrifice how many believe it today say Lord Breathe on Me Maybe you never had that Witness Lord send the witness of the Holy Ghost to me today blessed be the name of the Lord I was thinking of this verse 24 and let us consider one another to provoke one another unto love and to Good Works go ahead and nudge somebody on the right side of you just nudge them nudge somebody on the left side provoke means to strongly irritate them yeah there you go irritate them provoke them under love and good works wake up brother wake up Sister let's be Christians you sleepy sleep on your own time don't sleep on God's time we're in God's house God's wanting to speak to us who in the world would go in the presence of a mighty man and just sit there lethargically you might even dress up a little bit you might shave and uh how was it David when he was in the prison he went up he shaved his face and took a bath and got cleaned up he was going before someone who had great Authority we're in the presence of God today our creator The God Who changes situations he never Ethan brother Ethan goes into a situation but what he does doesn't change it amen as we were talking uh on Friday night a word from the Lord and I believe God gave a word from the Lord to individuals last night we spoke to the young people how that God knows you and Psalms 139 God knows your down settings he knows your uprisings your cell phone is Satan's uh technology and it knows when you lay it down and when you pick it up but God many many thousands of years ago said I already know your Downs settings and your uprisings Lucifer and Satan Eden just trying to produce what God already does he knows those things when he went over to David and David encountered some things in his life pornography and then adultery and then illegitimate child and then a conspiracy and are you with me today this is a man after God's Own Heart went through deep dark Waters in his life but Psalms 51 after that he said Lord create in me a Clean Heart Lord create in me a right spirit and whatever you do brother Patterson don't take your Holy Spirit from me don't take it from me God don't take it from me I need the spirit of God God don't take it from our churches where would we be without the spirit of God blessed be the name of the Lord I've walked amen God has sent justification amen by faith he sent a sanctification the by the washing of the water of the word to wash us to know what we should be washed from and what we should be as the bride and then he sent the quickening power of the Holy Spirit to Quicken us amen and I believe it I got to have it when I preach I got to have the Bible says we have an unction of the Holy Ghost we're not up here to read a bunch of quotes and and read some be part of the me too preacher movement no it's not that it's the unction of the Holy Ghost one time I was in a service and and my I went out and uh we brother said you know I had to preach and you're kind of nervous it was an elder and he went out and he had to explain this is a Pulpit this is the monitor this is this and this and I'm like I'm like David like I don't know about all this armor and this stuff just give me something that I know give me something of the holy spirit in my life that delivered me of habits and things that I couldn't deliver myself some give me something that I know we went back in the back room we held hands you might as well been holding this this little thing right here I thought Lord Jesus I need something more than that I need more something more than technology and we need something more than technology we need something more than the letter the letter will kill you but the spirit I said the spirit will will give you life amen the spirit is more than an emotion brother brother Patterson we were experienc the Pentecost and the things and that and God the prophet of God came along and said it's it is an anointing but it's more than anointing it's a life that God is trying to inject into a people the very life of Jesus Christ good to see brother yesi God bless you Sister Patty right I was at the in church in Ohio when they came out and said they got engaged I'm not a d dinosaur but I have been around a while we are not of those that draw back but those that believe to the saving of our souls Jesus makes this amazing statement little scripture there in Luke remember Lot's wife yeah Daniel remember Lot's wife brother vom said Lot's wife did the same thing you know she set out to go with lot follow her husband her children her loved ones but it wasn't in her heart she still loved the world so it's still possible you can make a start still be in the world and the world still be in you she never overcame even though she was well on the road it finally overthrew her she had to take one big long last look there's where she got caught don't even look back don't have no desires keep going keep your mind on Calvary keep moving towards Christ I say let's keep moving towards Calvary let's keep moving towards Jesus Christ amen there's been movements in the message we we've been around long enough I think brother's about the same age as I am you see pendulums That Swing this way and it swings this way and I remember one time going and preaching at a church and I thought you know can I even preach about the blood of Jesus Christ they were so revelated and and so many things and I come back to the scripture the Bible says we're made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ not your intellect by the blood of Jesus Christ God give us a revelation the word of God this is God's word this is the absolute well what about a prophet well we had 3,000 two 2,000 years and we had 3,000 denominations that were holding the same Bible and God sent us a Divine interpreter of the word of God and I'm so thankful that God sent a prophet and his name was William brandham and I'm not ashamed of it I know your your pastor's not ashamed of that name God wasn't ashamed when he came down and has a picture taken with him and if the angel Lord wasn't ashamed of him I don't want to be ashamed of him say brother Daniel do you have all the answers to the to the to the questions and and things like no I don't have all the answers but the part I do understand is such a blessing in my life it's changed my life it's set it on a course that's a whole another life but I tell you you put God first and he'll bless youen he will bless you Jude first chapter we got several scriptures stay with me long as I stay in the Bible I'll be safe right you should have a Bible brother Ron had an extra one back there was trying to give me a scofi Bible if you don't have have a Bible I want you to get a good Bible not a tattered one get you a good bible make it a part of your life amen we're living in a days when so much information comes to our mind we were talking about a couple of years ago they said a hundred years ago and this is an old article but they said a newspaper was about that thick a Sunday newspaper they said a hundred years ago the information that was in that one Sunday newspaper was more information that an individual lived a hundred years ago encountered in their whole lifetime they were just up on the hill and and now newspapers they've done away with the newspapers and now we're so bombarded with with uh uh um uh information and and we get it used to be they had a 30 uh uh second um on the television they have 30 seconds and the 15 seconds and now it's 7 seconds if you're interviewing somebody and you don't move and and and like that because we're we become um what is it the dopamine junkies we got to have a dopamine H and move and and so we're uh a lot of people are dopamine addicts their natural body has to kick in dopamine they say that's a whole another sermon it's called we are not ignorant of his devices but when your phone dings dopamine is released in your brain it's more addictive than cocaine and a person's got to and then they take phones from kids and they Wonder kids go crazy they take cocaine from a CO and they go it's more addictive and so you wonder what it is we need to say Lord don't let me be addicted even too myself God Saved Me From Myself amen given our free nature we will self-destruct brother Ron we will self-destruct we were talking to young people oh I'm strong I'm talented many people are destroyed by the talents that they had Elvis Presley was destroyed by his own Talent preachers can be destroyed by their own Talent God don't let my talents override me but let me fall on the Rock and be broken amen L the Rock fall on me and crush me to powder Lord not my will let God's will be done in my life surrender your life to Christ let him break you let him mold you and let him make something great out of your life blessed be the name of the Lord Jude the first chapter verse number five the Bible says I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not if you read a couple verses later in verse 7 the bible says this is written for an example God saved them out of Egypt and they did not continue to believe amen they went into unbelief and they destroyed actually they destroyed themselves they wandered in the wilderness amen may God help us today we live in a generation back to the whole thing of dopamine and so we get like this and we got to have information but God has raised up ministry that will help us in this generation God knew this generation was coming and God has molded and shaped men that they will minister in the same capacity amen how we say you know the old British remember the British they all lined up it was Insanity they the British come and they line up in straight rolls and they just shot and the the front runs they would shoot and then they would kneel down the guys behind them would shoot this guy would reload they would stand up the back and they just it was whoever brother I'm from the East and Gettysburg and and my they just is like and then Davey Crockett came along let's get behind a tree ding ding am man and now we the old warfar and the Germans and that and then now we're in urban Warfare where it's snipers up here shooting here and shooting here and and that's the way the sometimes the preaching of the word it's not when I grew up they come out and they had a stack of books brother Ron this High and the brother picked up a book and he read a quote and he said it over here you went to sleep and he was still halfway through and he come back you're like wow but we're not maybe like that today but God is taking a quote over here and a scripture over here and an inspiration like a sniper and going down into a young person's life and said look you need to flee that thing that thing is taking you a spirit of suicide that you follow that down there and you'll desire to take your life may God help us today amen May the Holy Spirit come and be a discerner I believe he's still a discerner amen I don't know all of your needs but God knows every one of your needs he knows right where you are in your life and he's come to minister to every one of us aren't you one that played the piano yesterday selftaught he sat at the piano playing a beautiful song that's a gift from God Amen I don't have that gift I could spend my whole life doing it but God has given him a gift may God anoint your gift and may the Holy Spirit come to you if you surrender your life to you he will bless you you give it to the devil he'll destroy you and take millions of souls to Hell amen God has put placed gifts in every one of our Lives amen we need to yield ourselves to the Lord and say Lord whatever I am may you take me amen and use me brother Ezra an engineer that God will take you and use you in the capacity that he wants to use you in however great however small usually it's something small we've got this ideology that minister to be a minister you got to have a microphone in your hand that's not what a minister is a minister is someone who finds the greatest need in the church it doesn't matter if there's a mouse coming through this church the greatest minister is the one that's going to catch the mouse and get rid of it right the need may God help us say Lord let be used in your kingdom Jesus Use Me Lord don't refuse me surely there's a work that I can do even though it's humble amen Lord let me be humble as well Lord and carry out the work of Christ amen Romans the first chapter this is a powerful chapter if you the day that we live in you should read this it's amazing praise the Lord Romans the 1 chapter 21 we're not going to read this whole chapter the Bible says because of that they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools now watch this we're talking about Humanity changed the glory of the uncorruptible god unto an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things now we think oh that's a bunch of idols and things like that but I want you to look at this verse again these people have changed the glory of an uncorruptible God the Bible says all things Colossians I believe all things were created by Him and for him Jesus Christ and people have taken this uncorruptible God and made into made him into an image like to corruptible man listen to me right here you say what does that mean brother Daniel when people will go through things in their life and maybe there's a separation of family and they say well I think I can Remar again because God listen to me because God will understand don't you realize that's the Fulfillment of that scripture you have taken The Incorruptible Eternal God who knows no sin that Angels stood for millions of years and cried holy holy holy and you have brought him down and made him like to you which is a corruptible man and said oh God will understand God understands one thing and that's his word god understands his word I'll say this if God was going to overlook one of his words he would have done it in the Garden of Eden that's right he's not going to overlook his word amen verse 24 this is powerful wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between them and change the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen this is a powerful verse verse number 28 if you don't have this marked in your Bible do you believe in marking in your Bibles AR minds are weak okay Noah heard the word voice of God one time for 120 years he built an ark in our generation God knew we would be weak and there' be social media and all these things flying he said look I'm going to give you a Bible Daniel just when you get weak just read your Bible amen just read your Bible verse 28 powerful verse and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge what is God he is the word of God because they did not like to retain brother Ron this Bible the word of God in their knowledge what did God do God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient oh you're sitting here and say God just give me a love for your word Lord and whatever you do don't turn me over to a reprobate mind amen Lord don't turn me over to a reprobate mind in another place it says to believe a lie and to be damned by it I'm not going back amen how's it say in Isaiah 559 the Bible says as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thought thoughts God's thoughts are not your thoughts they're higher than you are that's right you believe that today amen amen there's something bigger than you young Brothers there's something stronger than you there's something bigger than you it's Jesus Christ amen Romans 12: 2 is it all right to read the Bible in this church you know in some countries it's uh forbidden to read the Bible but we believe it amen Romans 12:2 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God people talk about trans well I guess I'm trans I'm transformed amen trans means to go across and Beyond and through amen transform to make through or ADD thorough or drastic change in the form and the appearance and the character and the Bible says be not conformed to this world but Daniel you need to be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen you just not come from a polywog but in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth God created Man In His Image do you believe it today and you need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind when the devil would try to destroy us and get our minds down and sh Shannon sung the song God bless you Shannon for singing that song I'm Letting Go am man we've all got baggage we've all got stuff from our past can you say amen I can't control what's back there I can't control who my father and mother were I was blessed to have a Godly father and mother the most worldly thing we ever sang in our song was Happy Birthday and Humpty Dumpty we never we never heard a country song never heard that nonsense I was raised in a Godly home but maybe some of you weren't that's okay God loves you maybe you never had a father he said I'll be a father to the fatherless thank you Jesus if you can ever take this this is Christ in word form and read it and say this is God speaking to me we talk Thursday night about a word from the Lord Brother Robert some have gone through things in our culture and our societies but if you can get alone and say the Bible says I will be a father to the fatherless than you you will be my son you will be my daughter come out from among them and be separate you'll never get that in the fast lane of Life you'll never get that on the fast lane of the internet somewhere it's men and women getting alone with God In Prayer so we talking to the young people the Bible says pray lest you enter into temptation that's where we're failing brother Saunders as people have have stopped praying and they're wanting to go to church and the preacher wave a magic wand over them and come with a new revelation and wave it over but that's not what Jesus is saying he's saying you need to pray am you're falling down all the time you need to spend time in prayer it's not a magic one it's not a new revelation it's time in prayer Pray lest she enter into temptation teach us to pray he says Lord lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil that's good for all of us what was that saying I wrote down at the bottom I was reading it said the call of depression the feel the feeling of depression is your call to prayer listen to me be transformed by the renewing of your mind most people feel think that the feeling of depression is to go to the psychiatrist and get pills but the feeling of depression is your call to prayer write that down the feeling of depression is your call God I need you Lord God I can't make it Lord I've got as we grow older brother we get disappointments in life and the hurts and pains they come and you sit there and the devil will take you to but KN it's your call to prayer all things work together for good amen the good times the bad times and even in David would go back and say I was a man after God's Own Heart I was anointed by God and I've created this terrible thing but here we are 4,000 years later reading the Bible and it's being for our edification to realize those men weren't perfect I'm not perfect but Lord you didn't throw him away David never resigned as king Dad don't stop being dad get down on your knees and say I've sinned David laid on his face said I've sinned I've done wrong but I'm Still The King I'm still dead I get up and go on in spite of the shame in spite of the reproach amen amen the devil you think you don't think going to church means something then why when you make a mistake listen to me does the devil tell tell you don't go to church why is that if it doesn't mean anything to the devil that people go to church why is it when you make a mistake the first thing will devil tell you don't go to church those people know about it I tell you what we need to be Overcomers Lord let me overcome amen the greatest battle ever fought is in my mind I'm going to church I'm going to the house of God because in the house of God Supernatural things happen Amen in the house of God evil spirits are cast out I'm way ahead of myself but Mark 16 if you have your Bibles this is our identification brother random preaches it sry right to take my coat off here amen thank you brother Ron this is our identification this building should not be your identification as a Christian Amen brother b f uh how is it five definite identifications of the true church and brother bam goes through five things that identify the church he takes us right to Mark 16 this is my identification as a Believer it's not because I believe the message it's it's not because I go to brother Ron church it's not because I say I'm in the message what does that mean this is my identification Mark 16 we'll back up a few verses because it's all the inspired word of God right not just Mark 16 17 but Mark 1615 is also inspired and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature somebody's got to do that somebody's got to do that that's why I'm standing here today because somebody has to fulfill that word and someday I'll stand at the Judgment of God and God says look Daniel I told you to go preach the gospel amen I told you to study Paul told Timothy give yourself to to exhortation and to reading and probably I don't know people do it it cost me like eight hours probably for every sermon every hour it's just like Lord this is not efficiency I tell my wife couldn't that's to be an easier way to do this there has to be an easier way 4:00 this morning I woke up and I'm just beginning to pray Lord Jesus I don't know what to say God what our words are meaningless we live our information going through but God if you'll take the words and you'll direct them to every heart every mother and every Father Can Be Touched by the spirit of God information is meaningless but the power of the Holy Spirit spoken Jesus said my words are spirit and they're life right so if the anointed word of God will come inside of you and I can be trans trans formed by the renewing of my mind Lord let me be transformed Mark 16 let's go to 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved if you're not baptized in this room today the Bible says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved the Bible goes on to say but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall does your Bible say shall not May these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils that's why we take the name of Jesus with you it's not it's the name of Jesus and the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ will cast out Devils how many found that to be true you come say Lord I I don't know it's kind of foggy Lord I don't know did I just get into this did I just marry into this thing how did I just stumbl is but the preaching of the Gospel cast those demons away so you're talking about Moses he comeing the presence of something Supernatural the bush he says I'll turn aside and see why this doesn't isn't consumed I'll see what this something is of the holy spirit that keeps moving in my life how's the Bible say when he the holy spirit is come he will convince the world convict the world of sin so how can sin dwell in churches and not have conviction come in somewhere the church has been falling down to a place of Ecclesia is the called out that's what it is in the I believe it's the Greek it's the Ecclesia they've come down and the world has had a form of godliness and they can dwell together it shouldn't be that way amen when we come into the presence of God and the Holy Spirit you shouldn't s be able to sit there and the Holy Spirit not discern sin in your life is that what the Bible says when he the Holy Spirit has come I think I'm saying it right brother patteron he will convince and convict the world of sin oh may God help us today he's quick and powerful he's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart you know what people walk away from something because it doesn't do anything for them walk away it doesn't do anything for me but when I take a drink of that brother Robert Hallelujah am and it becomes a part of me Jesus said taste and see that the Lord is good sitting up here brother Robert something moving in his heart watched a tear fall off and hit his tie and roll down strong man that just doesn't happen in this day right strong but I tell you what real men cry amen real men moved by the Holy Ghost it's more than your ambition it's more than money and Prestige because I tell you one day it won't mean anything the Bible says we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of God you're not going to stand there with your bank account you're not going to stand there with your career and your prestigious things you're going to stand the Bible says all things were naked and bare before him so we know that day is coming we've got the book it's an open book test so why not come into the presence of God today and say Lord here I am I'm bear I'm open I'm naked before you Lord as David said Lord create in me a Clean Heart Lord create in me a right Spirit are you with me today I'm glad I go to a church where the holy spirit is there he can convict of sins amen maybe something that's hid you've buried it way down underneath but the Holy Spirit knows he there and he'll pull it up and bring it to the Forefront it shouldn't take years to bring things to the Forefront it should be the freedom of the Holy Spirit to just be free in the church most people don't want that in our church they want a little form and keep God In The Box because if we let God out of the box who knows what God would say happened in ananas it's the safar's day the man Comm in said I sold the land for so much Peter just you sell it for sold much yeah I sold it for so much Peter said you've not lied to men you've lied to almighty God and the Bible says he fell dead we know the story and the Bible said fear come on the church there ought to be such a fear of God that come on the Church of God before we walk in that door say Lord forgive me of my sin Lord don't call it out Lord Jesus don't call it out here I I confess my sins because I tell you you come into the presence of God and the Holy Spirit will call it out it's the Holy Spirit say Lord Jesus don't don't say it to others I'll find a place I I'll ask you to forgive me Lord I've done wrong oh I love the presence of the [Music] Lord thank you Lord the Bible says as many as he loves he chastens and rebukes thank you Lord Brother Russell and it's never abuse some I had a father that loved me I had a great home life but I know others didn't and maybe there were abuse that went on in your home I'm sorry it's Jesus Christ is not the fault of that it's sin that caused that amen it's sin that caused that but we do have a heavenly father that when we do wrong he takes us in a room and he sits us down and say look I want to talk to you you don't do that you're a Son of God you don't talk like that you don't cuss like that you don't steal like that we're sons of God say but Daddy I really want to do it well son I've got something here it's called the Holy Ghost in Fire and if you'll take this it'll burn that desire it'll burn the want to out of your life and that's our problem we don't dwell long enough in the presence of God to let the fire of God consume and take the want to out of our life amen I I've been around a long time brother Robert I've seen people after the service they sit down and they meditate I I believe in meditation it takes something greater than medit ation it takes the fire of the Holy Spirit say Lord come into my life and burn these desires out of my life God lord create in me a Clean Heart Lord I need a right spirit I don't even like that sister Lord Jesus how are we going to spend time in heaven together we're not going to get it worked out over there we're going to get it worked out here I'll say this the preachers aren't even going to get it worked out over there they got to get it worked out over here and it's such a shame that it has to go right before people die like hey I'm sorry I'm like hey we lost 20 years yeah I'm not families people get things in the family's life I can tell you life is too short to not talk to your son or daughter life is too short to not call somebody and say hey I love you in spite of whatever I still love you blessed be the name of the Lord I don't know why it's going there but I tell you we're not of those that draw back but we're those that believe to the saving of our souls this will fix home life this will fix a lot of things Mark 16 we're all over the place but that's okay in my name you'll cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues do you believe in speaking with tongues I'm sorry I didn't write it it's in there so I just say Lord don't let my unbelief try to figure out why not to make it happen Lord just Lord let me be so full of the Holy Spirit I become a Believer and maybe you have a gift or maybe you pray in the spirit blessed be the name of the Lord that's a whole another sermon I'll let your pastor preach on that verse number 18 they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing shall not harm them it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I believe it's James brother Robert said if there's somebody sick we have some oil up there he believes in James 5:14 they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover stay with me I got a couple testimonies I want to share how God has has touched lives and healed people let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 I'm trying to hurry praise the Lord say that again brother thank you God bless you amen right praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 11 it's good for you to laugh right amen that's Goods like a medicine amen Hebrews 11: 23 the Bible's talking about Moses by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents Hebrews 11:23 they saw that he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was called to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter you know the word is written there but then God will take the scripture and make it flesh the Bible says and the Word was made flesh that's the word of God that was written and then God makes it flesh and it dwells among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten Son of God is it right to preach your testimony sister Sandy right here I I wrote it down seven years ago our sister she was raised in a Catholic home and she became a Christian and she went back home and said I'm a Christian and her mother said you're a Catholic she said I'm a Christian she said you're a Catholic she said well I might be a Christian Catholic maybe I'm a Christian Catholic her mother said you're a Catholic Christian but something had happened in Sister sy's life and to me that's the scripture becoming flesh amen and then the Bible says that Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter sister Sandy said I am Christian what's Christian means Christlike amen I'm a Protestant what's that mean I protest something I protest amen an organization and the the Council of churches I'm a Protestant I'm are you a pro Protestant I'm a Protestant I protest amen anything that's against the word of God I'm a protester well I I'm I'm just not a fire I try to make peace then you're not a Protestant amen we're Fighters we're warriors Paul told Timothy fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life you're not going to Coast into heaven you're going to have to be a fighter every day you're going to have to stand up amen put your your game face on and say Lord I I didn't call myself into this I was telling the young people I was raised in a message home the brandom Tabernacle and my my teacher told me you got the filthiest mouth in this chrisan school and I was a mess and I walked down and gave my heart to the Lord I didn't finish the testimony God changed my heart I called my girlfriend and said look it's not going to happen Okay I'm going a different way God's changing my desires and that's what God's in the the heart changing desire amen that's what he was he wants to change your heart change your desires we need that today how many know what I'm talking about when you say that's really me that's who I am I chase the L and the Fashions and the movies I just can't stop then you need a change of heart and we've all lived long enough to see those people just kind of dabble dabble in the God's not wanting dabblers he wants Warriors people that are called Chosen and faithful I believe Revelation chapter 17 those that came with him riding on a white horse they were called Chosen and they were faithful they were faithful to the house of God why we're covering a lot of ground today youall are pulling in so many Direction verse 25 choosing rather to suffer the afflictions of the people of God they chose they chose to suffer you chose to be a Christian Angel come to brother bam said you chose the harder way where's brother Steve mcney after last night he gave this the prophecy the angel come to brother say you've chose the harder way amen it is God's way you believe the word of God you're going to be despised and rejected of men so be it amen Paul said in the way that's called heresy so worship I the god of our fathers long hair skirts Prophet cult and the way that's called heresy so worship by the god of our fathers it's in the Bible no one was baptized any other way but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or they had to come back and be re-baptized to get the holy spirit is that what we believe I'm not of those that draw back amen I'm still a Protestant I'm still listen to this I'm still protesting something that killed 68 million of my brothers and sisters they killed 68 million of my brothers and sisters come on I want you to listen to this because if you know anything about the fox book of Martyrs they would take a cross a little crucifix and maybe they were there and they were getting ready to tie the the um the oxen on you tie them on your hand hands and your feet and they just pulled them apart and they would hold a cross in front of your face and all listen to me all they had to do was kiss the cross there's a cross we have it in our church it's a symbol of Christ right but to them when they were kissing the cross it was an allegiance to a system and they said I will not be identified with that system the same as Moses said I won't be identify oh if we had people and say I'm not going to identify with the world I'm not how they come to brother brand flat top you know brother BR can we have a flat top he said don't worry when you get my age you'll have a flat top he said I'm not here to tell you that he said just don't look like the world because if you love the world or the things of the world the love of the father's not in you is that what the Bible says Lord let me love you with all of my heart more than the Fashions more than the way that the world's going whatever way that they're going I don't want to go that way if they got tattoos and piercing in their bodies let me remember that I'm a temple of of the Holy Ghost I'm bought with a price the Creator left Heaven and Earth brother Mias and came down and die for me and he bought me with a price and I'm not piercing his house you are the temple that the Holy Ghost lives in that'll change the way you dress it'll change the way it'll change the way you eat I'm a temple of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen amen as we go on by faith forsook Egypt which was the world not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured seeing him who is invisible verse 33 and through faith faith is a revelation and through a revelation he they subdued kingdoms and wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the MS of Lon that's my buddy Daniel I live in a place where things are about to devour me every day I get up in evil spirits we were talking in the back room you know I'm from Jeffersonville area there Billy Graham visited said it's the most demon powered place in the

notes here but I don't know how to find them Lord help us found them this warped generation brother random talked about money women in popularity I mean what did he know about vaping and tattooing and piercing and anxiety and depression and gender confusion and greed and suicide and LGBT experimentation or video games that you not only connect to in your little room but now you're connected to the people in your city and and and and and then uh in other countries you're calling them together my goodness brother bam did say rock and roll would gather the world the Nations together for the battle of Armageddon watch every sport event that happens they all start with rock and roll music and it's all building the people it's rock and roll music and the prophet of God said it's Gathering them to to that place watch this cage fighting and desensitizing our society to killing people someday there may be the Christians all that could never happen no that same system that killed 68 million of my brothers and sisters turned them loose to the Lions we need to shake ourselves from this world and save ourselves say Lord bring a right spirit inside of me Lord we need the Holy Spirit we need to be sensitive we watch too many YouTube short videos and and and Instagram and it's desensitized us amen Jesus come on I was a Sunday school teacher one of my Sunday school teachers he was a he was agent and he got involved in some of the martial arts things and one day he they told us well he's fighting in this thing and I logged on to watch it and and he was in this Arena and they were hitting him and he was fighting I was a Sunday school teacher the Bible says Jesus went about doing good healing all that were oppressed of the devil right holy spirit's in you it'll do the same thing I'm a Sunday school teacher trying to teach them the things of God and every time the man would hit him I was like oh God no that's my that's my child that's my Sunday school student don't hit him don't hit him and you realize we become so desensitized people can shoot and kill and murder and all of that oh God help us to to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit when we see those things just get away from it that's trying to desensitize us and laugh laugh in and joking when the Bible says listen to me in he Ephesians chapter 6 all those that love Christ in sincerity there's some things that are sacred there're sacred things this is sacred amen I grew up in a generation where we didn't lay anything on it we didn't you didn't lay a pen on it you didn't lay anything because this is the word of God Jesus said my word is spirit and life I had a friend he did some terrible things in motel rooms he said the first thing I would do is take the Bible stick it in drawer and push it out because you can't do it in the presence of the word of God Amen that's why every day you should read your Bible and pray it doesn't matter where you read it open the Bible because when you open the pages the spirit of God begins to come out I don't understand it but I know it's the truth see what if should we bring this is this okay brother Ron you can get up behind me and correct this all right and so whatever you do we're in uncharted waters and things happen is this is this good is this good and I'll tell you how to tell you bring it in the presence of God Amen and whatever you do in your house and then before you go to bed I assume you all read your Bible and pray brother Ram said we start every day like that we end it every day and then you say okay now we're going to read our Bible and pray and if whatever you did that's a variable right there asteris it's a wild card whatever you did if you can't read your Bible and pray after that you need to do away with whatever that is right you fill in the blank mama you should be the one like all right we're going to have we're tired we're all going to go to and everybody kind of disa appears and goes to the room there's something wrong we need to bring the spirit of God back in and open our Bibles and just start reading it over there in the Psalms and the spirit of God discerns and dad says look we're not doing that anymore I say there's no shame in saying I'm in uncharted waters but I realize that it's too shallow right here this boat will never float in its path this family will never go on with this going on in our home are you with me today I tell you Mom ought to be the first one say hey if we continue on this path how's the Bible say hearken into the voice of your wife your wife says look this is not putting our young men on the right course this one sister if I do wrong you correct me brother's taking his his sons all to the basketball games or the basketball games are all and so one day the mom like I think I'll go and they brought her and they set her down and there's a cheer cheerleaders right in there and she's like you've been bringing my sons to this and brother Daniel's praying for him in the prayer line trying to get him delivered from pornography and you set him in front of this like oh this is a good what about the what about Bible says they ran from a lion they put their hand on a wall and a snake pit him may God help us today say Lord help me today will you lead me and guide me it's the Holy Spirit oh let's just turn him loose turn him loose in the room and say God get me away from the danger get me away from that get me away from the cliff I'm not trying there one man said we know the story of The Chariot Rider man said I need somebody to hire I go around this mountain man said I can drive within 4 inches of the edge of that man said that's that's no I can I've slid my Chariot within two inches man said what about you he said uh I'm a conservative whether you like the word conservative or not I try to say as far away as I can from the edge Heen let the world call you an old fogy and let them call you oldfashioned that's okay I try to stay away from the edge amen our virtues are are sisters amen the reason we you know we were talking we read it over here on Friday night the Satan come and said surely you'll not die right for God knows in the day that you eat thereof you'll be wise like a God and God is depriving you the Bible says for a woman to be dressed in modest apparel he's depriving of you because if you'll is this okay brother Ron if you dress an immodest apparel people will look at you you'll have more likes you'll probably be able to become an influencer and you'll make a lot of money being able to work from home not realizing that the Bible says you need to be in modest apparel because you have value that's right if there is another generation to come and young people that sit in a church it can only come through the bedding ground of a woman and it's holy we have a little garden I don't let people go and pour gasoline in our garden because that place is sacred and set aside for a reason is everybody mature and you're thinking with me and we guard that kids come and play in our yard but they don't get in the garden because it's a sacred place and we protect it and we cover it over and that is kept sacred for a man someday that you'll give yourself to it has value amen remember lot when he was down there he came and he came and he said look take my daughters he had no value for virginity there was no value for moral character are you with me straight out of the Bible and lot said look just take my daughters oh but up there there was Abraham he was listening to the voice of Elohim amen it was deserting his thoughts and we're sitting in just not any church we're sitting in a church that believes in discernment of the Holy Spirit believe God is a personal God he'll come down to every one of you this little girl sitting here that God give her a life and somebody sitting beside her that cares for God has a future for her and he loves her he has a future for every one of you and he's watched over you every day of your life thank you Lord and he's seen every tear that you cried and every heartache and pain that you've had and my Bible tells me that there's a coming a time where Christ will come out and he'll wipe every tear from your eye so don't worry it's all over you chose a harder way but that's why you're here today with Christ blessed be the name of the Lord we've got to get through this they quenched the violence escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong V wax valy and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised the life again verse 37 they were stoned that's not that kind of stones it's rocked and they were swn aund they were tempted were slain in with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy amen verse 37 they were tempted and I guess we're all tempted but I'm not going back amen Lot's wife is a memorial of somebody that turned back I am not going to be that kind of a memorial I'm going to die trying I'm going to die fighting brother R said if you lined up a prayer line of 500 people and I prayed for every one of them and every one of them 500 died he said tomorrow night I'd be on this platform preaching Divine Healing that God Is A Healer God Is A Healer he's a savior amen David the Bible says he ran towards Goliath he didn't run away from it he ran towards Goliath he was anointed amen there's a group of people that are anointed by the Holy Spirit they're not running amen they're anointed by the holy spirit for a reason God has chose you in this day in the darkest hour it's never been this day to dark and God chose you he chose me I'm aside from the times I got to spend hours on my knees bringing myself my mind and the battles into the place that I can Minister the word of God and become a a channel that God can use me and say Lord anoint me that I can speak the word of God mom may God anoint you to be the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John and mother what is written in your book what is written in your book I'm not drawing back away from Holiness I'm not drawing back away from baptism in jesus' name amen I'm not drawing back away from the power of God say brother Daniel how can I do it that's a good question isn't it Mary said that how can these things be right the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you hallelujah how am I going to make it brother Daniel the Holy Ghost brother Amos is going to overshadow you Hallelujah you're going to go to a church and just not a cold formal six months before they print a program we're just getting through it no we just go in there and say Lord speak just say it Lord just say it and Minister like the other night we were ministering a word from the Lord and yesterday just praying with the sisters and Tears In Her Eyes tears are a language that God understands amen I'll say it again tears are a language that God understands blessed are the broken in spirit amen blessed are the pure in heart they're going to see God how many want to see God then you got to be pure in your heart you're going to have to lay aside the world and the things of the world if you ever amount to anything amen you you're going to have to turn your face amen the Bible said he set his face as a flint towards Calvary what was that self- crucifixion self-denial Lord I'm going to set my face as a flint when we live in a world when the Bible says there'll be lovers of their own selves that's why there's iPhones and ie this everybody's they worshipers of theirselves but somebody's going to lay down their own will like Christ said not my will Lord let your will be done there's a group of people like that let's go to Genesis chapter 17 I'm trying to go through this we are not of those that draw back but those to believe unto salvation how am I going to do it well let's go back and look at somebody in the Bible because the Bible says all this was written as examples right so Genesis 17:1 and when Abram was 99 years old it's the father of our faith he was 99 years old the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect how's in 99 year old man going to bring forth a child and God said walk before me Abraham and be perfect be complete be mature and that's what God is asking you today is walk before me I am the almighty God it's impossible with just a Creed or just you can make this message a Creed I was listening to it the other day I was preach listening to a message I think it's the way back or ausa Revival brother rand's talking he said now you Pentecostals listen to me right here I'm going to preach can the denomination why we're not an organiz ation and brother R he's preaching to Pentecostal people he said your families come out of denominations he said you look at Revelations chap 17 the the mother and the harlots and blasphemous names Baptist and Methodist but he said you could become a Blasphemous name as yourself if you don't have the Holy Spirit dwelling inside of you we'd say Amen oh look at those Pentecost but let's just bring it down home a little bit farther let's come 50 years later downside and we're looking back yeah those Pentecostals called those Methodist and Baptist and said it was Blasphemous names we can see the Pentecost but what about in our message and we say oh I'm a message believer and unless you have the life inside of you it can become Pentecost is not a bad word it was they made it a denomination the message is not a bad thing it came from God but we hide under a cloak sometime and it can become a Blasphemous name and deception to you it's not just believing the message I can tell you the Bible says the Vil believes and trembles the Bible says have you received the Holy Spirit have you received the quickening power since you believe the message oh blessed be the name of the Lord walk before me and be you perfect if you have a sko filled Bible he goes into that the almighty God almighty God is Hebrew L which is the strong one Shad is breast Shad ey is the breasted one amen the strong breasted one and there's a people that are Nursing From elshad the breasted God they're reading their Bible in the dark darkest age they're nursing from God they're praying and tapping into a strength and a power they're listening to a prophet's voice that God has stored up you remember brother branham's desire was not to store the tapes up it was the angel of the Lord that told him go and record those there's coming a time when you'll be gone and people will be feeding that we need to be listening to The Prophet's voice we are not independent churches around that are just good preachers and we're no we're following a message Revelations 18 come out from among her and be ye separate sayeth the Lord we're following a message well what are you doing preaching brother Daniel well we just read it in Mark 16 right going to all the world and preach the gospel we had a prophet that turned our faith back to the Faith of Our Fathers and we're encouraging you I'm not telling you don't listen to it I'm telling you look there's 1,200 of you you should go and listen to it it doesn't matter which one just pick one up and listen to it God will strengthen your heart he'll strengthen your faith amen and the other thing you should do is go to church when you get down so low you can't see what's up you'll go and somebody will play music The Bible brother random says it takes it from David there playing music cast out Devils you come and somebody starts playing a song sister Jill brother Austin Justin they play a music and an evil spirit like hey yeah how'd I get here I don't know but I'm here go to church it's what the Bible says for forsake not the assembling yourselves together amen I was listening to a message the other day then Jesus came will you give me just a few more minutes want to share some testimonies brother brandom's in a discernment line and he tells us I've just been studying some of the early Pentecostal peoples this was more than just a healing evangelist there was something different and that was the sign of the Messiah what Jesus did at the woman at the well what happened at the tent of Abraham it was something different than just a healing line that people were healed many people had healing Miracles and we believe in that but this is something different it's an identification that Christ came again not in a body but he came as the son of man I think it's the anointed ones at the end time who is this son of man it's Christ the word that has come in our generation and so brother random is in a prayer line he said how do you do sir people that never met brother ROM brother Ram says I've never seen you in my life did I as far as I know you've I you've seen me but I've never seen you he said well here's one thing I want to tell you and we know many times he would brother Ram said now I don't know what I told you you'll have to go back and listen to the tape he said I'm just a microphone that God speaks and use my voice to pass through so brother randam yields himself to the Lord so there's one thing I want to tell you he said a few nights ago sitting here in the audience you accepted your healing from a heart trouble so this Angel of the Lord that was speaking through brother brandom knew that this man a few nights ago had had had had been accepted his healing his heart trouble he said you're standing here for someone it's your stepson I want you to watch this here's a broken family and things but the angel of the Lord God knows this man has a stepson he said that's exactly right he's got a spinal condition that's exactly right he's an alcoholic and so now in this broken family with a lot of moving parts that brother bam has no he doesn't know this man but the angel of the Lord is Discerning what is happening to this man he said he's an alcoholic and he says this you don't even know where he's at so here's a man who has a stepson and this man doesn't even know where this this stepson is but now not brother brandom doesn't know this man doesn't know but now the angel the Lord is coming and knows all about the situation that he's alcoholic and knows exactly where he's at oh if that God is the same yesterday today and forever he knows where you're at he knows all about your situation he knows about your broken family amen and he is the answer to every problem that we have he's Jesus Christ he's Jesus Christ he's in this room amen thank you Jes he's in this room Paul falls down said who are you Lord he said I am Jesus whom now persecutest blessed be the name of the Lord Lord I've got to go through this quickly let's go through this Moses they came out brought them out of Egypt 10 notable Miracles they come out they and there's mountains on both sides and now here's the Army coming behind him looked like God was a terrible General to bring him but we are not of those that go back and that's when the people started said hey conditions got bad we should go back but there that's when Moses starts crying when you get to that place you need to do what other men have done before you Moses starts crying to God we need to start crying to God I'm not talking about saying a prayer I'm talking about crying to God like God I don't know what to do it's just not me it's my family and I got 2 million people here and I didn't call myself to this place but you called me to this place God you brought me to this are you with me today and we need to cry out to God and then God spoke to him he hears the Cry of a Desperate Heart he comes to and says Moses why are you crying you need to speak and go forward not go back to the world but speak and go forward brother random said that he said sometimes he does that let the doctor walk away and say you you ain't going to live he said you're going to die Cancer's going to kill you you'll never get up from that chair seems like he leaves you God leaves you with no retreat he is your retreat climb up into his arms there's a natural world in we live in but now a prophet is telling why don't you climb up come up higher Revelation 4:1 why don't you come up higher I hear what you're saying C tast I hear I I see what you're saying but that's not what I'm going to do I'm going to come up a little higher into the Arms of Jesus Christ Christ he's my refuge he's my strong tower the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and they are safe some of you sit here and the doctors told you that you have no hope but you're sitting here today God's your healer I don't know how to preach but this just comes to mind a sister in our church she got breast cancer and we came up and we were praying she was pregnant with the little boy I don't know if I've shared this here before but I'll share it again some of you might not have been here we we stood around we prayed as as a church and we were praying the lights all went out the power went out in the church and then the lights come back on the prophecy went forth and said there'll be a dark time in your life but God will bring you through it and it'll be light again Hallelujah God healed her of the breast cancer gave her a wonderful Boys 30 35 years old has wonderful children God is our healer he is our refuge from what the doctors say what man would do unto us God is our healer here a few years ago she got leukemia in her blood and she went to the doctor and the doctor looked at her because he knew her case he said lady listen you got to die sometime how would you like your doctor say I know God heal you but you got to die she came to the church we had a prayer line we anointed her with oil not today Satan not today Satan Hallelujah God's healed her she's cancer free living a wonderful life God is our healer when the devil says there's no way Amen Let God open the Red Sea and let's just walk a supernatural life be well in the name of Jesus Christ be well we've got oil here if the doctors give you no hope there is hope and me brother Patterson there's hope I mean he's sitting here today was it been 2 years ago he just had a few months to live he's sitting here today God is our healer God is our deliverer he's our savior he's the same yesterday today and forever amen there's no retreat in God go forward when the doctor says cancer go forward when he says it's TV go forward if the devil tells you you to give up go forward if your home says that you're going to become a fanatic go forward amen I remember that when people told me you're a fanatic you're going to blow your brains out brother Daniel I went down I sat by the Ohio River amen where the prophet of God was with the angel I sat by the rever said Lord I don't want to be a fanatic I want to be a Christian I didn't blow my brains out I did lose my mind because the Bible says let the mind that was in Christ let it be in you and only those that have the mind of Christ are sane anybody that won't accept Jesus Christ you might live 100 years and die and go to a devil's hell but Jesus said I've come that you might have life and you'll have eternal life anyone that doesn't accept Jesus Christ is out of their mind why do I listen to them why do I make them the idols and why do I want to go to a devil's hell no listen I read the back of the book I wi it's cheating brother Daniel they said we could do it as open book I'm going to do it read the back of the book take advantage of every resource you have to win right I read the back and those that are with Him amen they win amen they're called Chosen and faithful I want to be faithful I'm not going to draw back but I'm going to believe to the saving of my soul I'm going to fight I'm going to fight till my last breath Hallelujah brother R said speak and go forward speak what his word and go forward thus sayth the Lord and move on a couple more quotes brother Ram said when it comes into a person talking about the Holy Spirit or persons into a congregation into a man or woman he vindicates his presence he proves that he's there why when God comes Supernatural signs begin to appear appear do you believe that if he's in this room he's Supernatural he'll discern your thoughts he'll heal your body he'll deliver you amen habits of things your life they'll leave in the presence of Jesus Christ when Christ comes God comes the supernatural signs begin to appear this person becomes a changed person they become trans not their kind of trans they're transformed by the renewing of their mind they're a Son of God daughter of God made in the image of God the lord they're no more like they used to be sin has vanished from their life fear and doubt has vanished frustration they're solid they're stable live or die it's Christ they don't care what comes or goes nothing shake them they move forward my goodness I got so many things here I'm just going to pass on I'll just preach like you know I just preach through this you know Hebrews we don't have time to read it Hebrews chapter 3 the Bible says they didn't mix it with faith Israelites they didn't mix it with faith and they died in the wilderness they didn't never got to the promised land they've never got to the rest I'm trying to close they never got there brother GE brother brother Ron they never got where there's amen they had land flowing with milk and honey and the benefits and the joys of being a Christians they they died in the wilderness Jesus said come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and I'll give you rest they never got to the promised land of rest which brother Ram says was the type of the Holy Spirit rest he goes on to say where they've ceased from their own labors you're ceased from your own self trying to be good by Rehabilitation there is a rest to the people of God it's the Holy Spirit brother bam goes if you if you you just follow that through Isaiah chapter 28 the Bible says precept must be upon precept line upon line here a little there a little for with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people to whom he saith this is the rest wherein ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing that shall come from the Holy Spirit we need a refreshing of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives we need people that will go across into canaan's land amen sometimes we spit and slobber and cry a little bit it's because we're eating the grapes we're eating the fruits from that Wonder blessed land and there's joy there oh sure we're fighting amen every day is a fight but we've got joy we've got power and we've got Victory we're not a defe defeated people we read the back and we win we don't look at the things that are seen they're temporal but the things that are not seen are Eternal and the Bible says they saw him who was invisible they saw their wellbody amen sister pear and they walked into it and they're alive today amen sister Becky they saw their well body and they walked into it Amen brother B says Envision that well body and just walk into it you say brother Daniel I can't overcome this and I can't overcome this but he's already overcome it walk into Jesus Christ and overcome that thing blessed be the name of the Lord we're fighting we're fighting giants I understand they're there I'm fighting giants it's depression and anxiety but greater is he that is in me than he that is in that Canaan land over there amen greater is he that is in me and I'm coming for you because Footprints mean possession amen days on the calendar mean possession I'm not going back I'm an overcomer you need to write that inste of Mark it and say I overcame today I'm in church today I'm a Christian today I'm not going back like my family or those around me I'm a Christian I'm fighting on I'm still standing blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah they had Hittites and jebusites and pites and we fight all kinds of ites we fight websites and all kinds of and IES and IES and whatever those things every kind of demon of Hell brother man said the lid has been taken off of hell every imp is out here and that's why 200,000,000 demons brother Ram said are released on the Bride of Jesus Christ we figured it up one day I think it was like 20,000 per demons per person you wonder what you're fighting against it's demons pray pray pray Daniel the Bible says Daniel got down and he prayed and an angel come and touched him and strengthened him and said be strong be strong we need to pray that the angels of God Amen will come around and strengthen us it happens in prayer it happens in prayer I was thinking about that they entered the promised land and footsteps meant possession I was thinking about that before they went over they sent two spies I'm going to share just some testimonies can I share some testimonies we'll close I SP sent some spies over into the land people went over there come back said oh taste and see it's wonderful taste and see that it's really good being a Christian loving the Lord being married is a good thing amen it's a good thing the Bible says marriage is Honorable contrary to what the world says young people listen to you marriage is Honorable amen why is the devil fighting if it was easy everybody'd be doing it but nobody's doing it that's why it's hard because out of the institution of marriage is the only legitimate way to bring children into the world right that's what the devil is fighting he fought it in the beginning God wanted it to be the Creator spoken word is Original Seed the first one would have been Christ brother Ram said it would have been the spoken word just like and the devil fought the bringing of children into the world and the devil was fighting your union and your marriage and once you realize that you realize oh this is just the devil trying to get us separated that's why the dword should never be used it's until death do we part amen for sickness or health poverty or riches and we might be in the poverty we might be in the bad times but God has joined whatsoever God has joined us together and God has joined us together and I'm not a perfect person my wife is pretty much a perfect person but God bless but I'm imperfect but she's working on me and God's working on and God's working on all of us together I don't know who that was for but may God help us I was thinking of just a couple things God sent spies over into the land I thought about my son Ethan one day we were sitting on the porch with my friends we were away on vacation with some friends and directly my son Ethan and one of the boys went riding off and directly this boy came back and he was running I'm like Hey where's where's Ethan he said man the four-wheeler flipped over and Ethan's up there and he's trapped underneath the four-wheeler and I I got out but he's not out I remember it well because I was barefoot and I'm a Tenderfoot it was a gravel road and I ran on the gravel road to try to get to my side and I ran up this mountain it was running up there and I got and directly he come down I like Ethan what what he said dad I was laying under the four-wheeler and I was about to die and somehow I was able to get out and I got free and we hugged one another cuz our God am man is he's a deliverer her you've probably got things in your life you could share testimonies I I write them in my Bible when the devil says look God's not with you I write them in my Bible there's a pages in the front and the back of it it's not for just notes to write the people beside you it's to write the Miracles in the Supernatural of God I go back and I read those things because God is a living God Jesus that's what the difference is is the presence of God that's right you take a strong man Moses a ruler he walks up and something speaks to him says change the order of your dress change your shoes take your shoes I'm not doing it I was a ruler in Egypt like what made the difference the presence of God Amen I'm not walking in this room and you tell me how to dress I can't pierce my body it's the presence of God Moses knelt down he took his shoes off in that presence Everything Changes amen sometimes we've been trying to live by a law but if we could come in a presence brother the holy spirit and just the Bible says be still and know that I am God and know that God knows everything about you as we read last night God go way down your life maybe you hit it five years ago and God go down in that conversation and said no you did that business deal and you're wrong and you experience the discernment of the power of God that's the church I want to be a part of a real Church a living church I thought about this am I be too long you just give me a couple more minutes for some my sons are still alive and I'm thank for it today but it's the grace of God it would all be different without Christ that's right so he said with David take not your Holy Spirit Lord don't go away from me I you're you're all I got Jesus Christ is all this church has the Holy Spirit it wasn't built on just material things but brother Ron and the testimony sister Sandy and my son we had a muzzle loer somebody gave me a muzzle loer a few years later I said Son where my muzzle Lo anybody know the difference between fast burning powder and slow burning powder and a muzzle loader and a regular so my sons they took uh regular bullets and they took and broke the bullets off and took the fast burning powder and put it in a muzzle loader you don't do that do you and so my son he said Dad we took the muzzle loer and we broke these bullets and stuck it inside of there and put something down there he said we held it up and we shot it if you know a muzzle order they make the diameter of the barrel bigger because there's a lot of impact uh percussion in it I said when he shot it he said dad that Barrel peeled back like a banana peel all the way back peeled back right to back to our hands and and it and then God stopped it and it didn't kill my sons he's everything to me amen I said Jesus Christ is everything he's my father he's my mother he's my sister he's my brother he's everything when you testify of him he comes close to us you feel the presence of God man time doesn't mean anymore if you got to go just feel free to get up I understand maybe you got to let your dog out or whatever you got to do you got to go but Jesus Christ is here today he inhabits the es of his people when you talk about him he comes close and maybe you got a need and you say the doctor's told me this or my culture has told me as they told Shadrach mesach and AO you will bow you will bow to this culture if you want a job or you're going to be successful you will bow to the image of what we got and they said you know what we're not bowing to your image we'll give you one more chance say look we already read in the book over there thou shall not make unto thee any graven images so you can give me a second or third chance but I cannot bow amen to that image God these are men brother Robert who only had the letter they did not have the Holy Ghost all they had was the letter and they were just reading the letter what would it be today if people had the Holy Ghost amen that wrote the word of God and said I'll give you the power to live the word of God out I'll give you power Jesus told him he said you go ter in Jerusalem too you be endued with that power that's what we need we need to wait until we be indued with a power lord I can't live it but I've got a power for you Peter it'll come inside of you it'll give you power to be a witness for me so many people are trying to be a witness in life and they haven't got the power of the Holy Spirit but he's here today the holy spirit is searching amen he's turning things over in our life he may come tomorrow and today he's getting us ready amen the bride is making herself ready I was thinking about a I testified I had a growth on my foot and I went to I was going to the university I went in and there was a man he didn't believe in God's healing power and I told him I said no I believe they shall anoint with oil and pray the prayer of faith and God will raise them up and when I was doing that the devil said yeah but you still have the symptom and I did I pushed I remember sitting at the table I pushed over like yes the pain is so great but my God Is A Healer I remember taking my Bible I took the Bible I opened it up to Mark 16 to our pastor I said it says right there they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they will anoint with oil and pray the prayer you anoint with oil and God God said God said he would heal me I told that man I said believe God is a they prayed for me and God is healing me right now God is healing me maybe you've never come to that place where you draw drove a steak down amen you need to drive a steak down somewhere and say right there Jesus Christ drove a steak down one day drove a steak down and he hung on the steak it said I'm their savior I'm their healer he cried it is finished it's finished the steak has been driven and all that look to Jesus Christ will be saved amen it wasn't a few months after that the grow of my foot had all dried up and it fell off my foot to pre prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if he would do it for me why wouldn't he do it for you the Bible says he's no respector of person the Bible says confess your faults one to another that you might be healed if you got sin in your life God has no obligation to heal you but you confess your sins God I've done wrong I've sinned remember the prayer cloth letter brother Brandon would send it out he said get your family together and confess your sins yeah Lord I've sinned God forgive me Daddy's get your family together say Daddy's done wrong he's been lethargic but we're rededicating this house to God this family is going to be dedicated to God I thought about a sister in our church she couldn't have children I don't know if I've shared this testimony I'm going to share maybe a couple more and then we'll close she couldn't have children she wanted to have children and one day she came up brother hom longor we anointed her with oil and we prayed the prayer of faith and just a few months after that she conceived and had a child and she was so happy she had a baby because God Amen just like in Abraham amen he caused the child to come and he caused the child few years later she wanted to be have another child she tried and they couldn't have a child same Minister came back in town work the first time work again you went up I can't have a child I Anointed with and pray for her she went home conceived a child God's a he he's a he's a way maker it's more than a song He's a way maker where there is no way thank you Lord few years later she had another got had a child said I thought I had to go up and get prayed for be anointed like no God Is A Healer he'll heal you blessed be the name name of the Lord amen another sister came up she had a brace on her back she was in so much pain she had fallen down the stairs we anointed her with oil and we prayed the prayer of face she went back she wrote me a long testimony of God I don't had she wrote it all out said brother Daniel I went back to my seat realized I don't have the pain anymore she said I went to the back and took the brace off and come out and testify God healed me he's a he's a Healer am man it was a miracle God heals by Miracles God heals by Divine Healing but somewhere you got to have a place you drive your faith down and from that hour he begin to a men from that hour God is healing me and they testified of those things amen I thought about that such a powerful thing I remember Sister Sandy she she had that her her testimony just stays so with me how that she became a Christian and her father I hope this is not too personal she shared it personal she said her father told her I would rather you be an immoral person than be a Christian sister Sandy picked up her suitcases and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us and she picked up her suitcases she walked away from her father I believe nine or 10 children that brothers and sisters that she was Raising and she walked away from them with her suitcases because she loved God Amen one place it said they love not their lives even unto death and now she walks away with a broken heart brother R because she loves Jesus Christ not just Hebrews chapter 13 but if they write another book of Acts there'll be a group of people's lives will match that amen sister Sand's testimony it's so powerful God has written another book of Acts and she loved her brothers and sisters and she went she tells sits across the road and sat in the bushes and looked at her brothers and sisters weeping in her heart that she wants to have fellowship with him but she can't because of her love for Jesus Christ only God help us to fall in love with Christ like that if it cost my family my friends it's more than a song If my mama don't go I'm going on my daddy don't go I'm going on I'm going on with my Jesus just the same amen thank you can I share your testimony brother Ron and you all have testimonies these are just Miracles that God has done brother Ron we've grown to love one another he went to Germany worked trying to spread this message across to the world brother Ron became very sick you probably heard the testimony but we'll just share it's it's good to see testimonies that are living and brother G Ron goes there and took his family with the brother Amos sister Rebecca and brother Matthew amen it's not easy you have a family and God calls a man and then their family has to just be caught in the draft of the ministry I went to my sons the other day and said I'm sorry that God called me to the ministry and it's affected your life but I can tell you that God has blessed my family because of the sacrifice you can't do something for God but what God doesn't bless you brother Amos me God heals our bodies when we're sick sister Becky and here we are today with the blessings of God and God has blessed brother Matt and his life and the challenges way back and now God has blessed his life brother Ron he tells the testimony how he was sick the doctor gave him a year to live and he was six months into and he he tells the testimony he couldn't even blow a candle out you like your birthday candles every time you have a birthday and you start to blow out think about brother Ron that was sick and he couldn't blow the a candle out said he couldn't walk down the street couldn't climb up three steps without being winded and he's there and he's he has a lung disease and he's about to die and he's laying in the hospital and he looks up on the counter is this okay it's kind of personal but hey we have personal testimonies I'm sharing his I don't he looks up on the calendar and there's a calendar in Germany another country different language it says this sickness is not unto death he takes the calendar I think he took it he said can I have that he takes the calendar and he goes back and brother brother brother Ron was there to purport the message of brother Brandon we believe God sent a prophet in the message of this day and so he was there to take the sermons to the different nations and he prayed this prayer he says I I've written it down from seven years ago he said Lord Jesus if you were here I would go to you and you would lay your hands on me and I would be healed if your Prophet was here I would go to him and he would lay his hands on me he was healed I would be healed he said but he's not here here and the closest thing that I have to the message of the hour that's coming our day is the tapes and brother Ron gives a testimony he affirmed it the other day he said I took those tapes and laid them out in the shape of a cross like that cross on the floor he said I laid them out in the shape of the Cross sister San is here to testify he said I got down and I laid on that cross of those tapes and God healed him God raised him up he's sitting here as a testimony I believe it was a week later he said he climbed that mountain I believe Amos you might have been with him he said he climbed that that mountain because God Is A Healer he wouldn't be sitting here today if it wasn't for Jesus Christ he's a Healer amen say brother Daniel that's that's fanaticism L it wasn't the tapes that healed him it was faith in Jesus Christ and I want to have a faith in Jesus Christ faith comes by hearing brother Amos and he said whatsoever things you desire when you're praying you believe it and you shall have whatsoever you ask for maybe you're sitting here this morning and you have a need in your life amen amen you can be healed you can be delivered whatever it is I don't know what it is we all live in complicated lives but the Bible says whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe it and you shall have what you ask for amen maybe you're going through a deep trial right now with our heads bowed just feel the Holy Spirit we just maybe you have something in your heart right now maybe you'd really desire a baptism of the holy spirit amen you'd like to R lift your hand say brother Daniel that's me God bless you yes God bless you Hallelujah maybe you're sick in your body you'd like to raise your hand say I'm sick brother Daniel nobody knows God bless you yeah they look healthy but I'm sick but but God Is A Healer God healed brother Ron and he can heal us those people that we Anointed with oil and prayed the prayer of faithful he's in this room maybe you got sin in your life the Bible says if you confess your sins he's faithful and justif forgive you of your sins maybe you'd like to raise your hand and say God forgive me amen this morning God bless you God bless you I've got unbelief which is the only sin I've got unbelief God bless you young brother God bless you be honest with God maybe you're a young man here today and you're hooked on things and you're doing things and looking at things that aren't right God is a God that deliver you of that addiction today amen all things are possible to them that believe oh blessed be the name of the Lord he's here amen all things are possible in this presence of God whatsoever you desire When you pray believe it and you shall have it it's not

that draw back but I'm those that believe to the saving of my household oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen if you'll play Something Heavenly Father you see the hands that have been raised this brokeup sermon Lord Jesus but your presence is here dra [Music] oh God oh God you said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden I will give you rest Lord may we just throw down those little

back as the song said I'm never going back to the way it used to be maybe you're here today I have a bottle of oil brother Robert said there's a bottle of oil up there maybe somebody's sick in your body today you say brother Daniel I'm sick and if God healed those people I believe that brother Ron God heard his prayer and saved him and healed him amen as a miracle if he would lay his hands on me I believe God would heal me too we're the only ones that make it impossible with God thing all things are possible I said all things are possible to them that believe how many believe today then I'm here to say all things are possible to them that believe your situation that you've put the last Lazarus they sealed it they sealed the stone and said it will always be this way and Jesus said show me where you laid him show me where they laid him he said roll away the stone you have put God in a place that he can't be the god that works the impossible and you have to wait Lord it doesn't have to be this way anymore it can change because the supernatural God and Jesus said come forth and he that was dead he was rotten he came forth why he's the resurrection he's the life he can resurrect you who were dead in sin and trespasses has he resurrected can you say Amen to that I'm so thankful he resurrected me amen let's sing it again as I turn it back if you're in need you like us to pray we'd

climbed up on the dead man and he came to life you just obey the spirit of the Lord whatever he would speak to you say Lord speak to me as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God don't look at what God's leading somebody else you be an individual say God's leading me I'm going to just raise my hands I'm just going to Worship the Lord I'd like this sister to pray I'd like this brother to pray maybe you got something to make right you need to go to that one if you won't forgive your brother their trespasses neither will your heavenly father forgive you your trespasses we need to forgive in the presence of God let's sing it again as the holy spirit is free Among Us in love with Jesus Oh falling in love oh fall falling in love with Jesus Falling in Love with j and falling in love with Jes was the best thing I've [Applause] ever amen I believe the Holy Spirit has been speaking this morning by the foolishness of preaching he sent his word and his word healed the people you have not because you ask not the Bible doesn't say call for the sick says call for the elders so we're not here to call the sick if you're sick you call on the elders you understand we got
