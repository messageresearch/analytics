[36:39] uh verse 19- 21 then Genesis 21 1 and
[36:45] two amen thank you for bringing your
[36:48] little leak of fire and we
[36:53] will we will not know what God is going
[36:56] to do to us amen it's always a two ways
[37:00] that's right I will be the preaching and
[37:02] you will be the receiver amen amen and
[37:06] God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee
[37:08] a son indeed and thou shalt call his
[37:11] name Isaac so at this moment Isaac has
[37:15] not yet been born if Isaac is not born
[37:19] by Sarah then the future seed of the
[37:21] elect of God would not have come forth
[37:24] that's right so this is a specific
[37:26] promise to
[37:28] Sarah and I will establish my Covenant
[37:31] with him for an Everlasting Covenant and
[37:33] with his seed after him and are for
[37:38] Ismael I have heard the behold I have
[37:40] blessed him and will make him
[37:43] fruitful and will multiply him
[37:47] exceedingly 12 princes shall be beget
[37:50] and I will make him a great nation amen
[37:53] so if anyone becomes great it is because
[37:57] God makes him great that's
[37:59] right but my Covenant will I establish
[38:02] with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto
[38:05] thee at this time in the next year so
[38:08] during the time Sarah is 89 years old
[38:11] when God spoke this uh concerning her
[38:14] and so the promise of God must come
[38:16] specifically through a woman and no
[38:18] other woman but only Sarah amen but the
[38:22] problem is he was already 89 years old
[38:25] so there is a mystery hidden
[38:28] in this types and shadows right so let's
[38:32] uh jump to Genesis chapter 21 and one
[38:36] and
[38:37] two and the Lord visited Sarah as he had
[38:42] said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he
[38:46] had spoken amen for Sarah conceived and
[38:49] bear Abraham a son in an old age at the
[38:53] set time of which God had spoken to him
[38:56] so the conception of the Bride of his
[38:58] hour is produced by the visitations of
[39:01] an Angel and may the Lord have the
[39:03] blessing upon the reading of his word
[39:04] you may now be seated so the title uh
[39:08] tonight is the enforcers of the
[39:11] Covenant the enforcer of the Covenant so
[39:15] if I if I will uh bring uh a subject it
[39:20] will be the restoration of
[39:24] Sarah between the appearing of
[39:28] the Lord and the coming of
[39:31] Isaac and we know that Genesis chap 12
[39:36] uh I we know that uh we can preach about
[39:40] Abraham uh every preacher everything you
[39:43] can preach it
[39:45] maybe not only a month but a year or
[39:49] even
[39:51] eternity amen
[39:53] because there's
[39:55] always when the SE was
[39:58] opened the open book when the seal was
[40:02] open it could no longer be sealed again
[40:05] that's right so it just keep on
[40:07] unfolding keep on unfolding keep on
[40:11] unfolding praise Lord because we have an
[40:13] open book so this Bible becomes a new
[40:15] book so in Abraham alone we can get a
[40:19] lot of uh
[40:22] sermons as the Lord's inspired and we
[40:26] know that
[40:27] uh God had a pip Ministry so each
[40:30] Ministry can get a little angle and a
[40:34] little angle and we can form into a
[40:37] picture it's just like Apostle this is a
[40:40] this is a this is not a oneman
[40:43] revelation amen amen so so that no one
[40:46] can say oh I am the greatest I am the
[40:48] best I am the great no that is Lucifer
[40:51] mentality that's right and we know
[40:54] Lucifer always want to become the best y
[40:57] he was the best of all but if we love
[40:59] the Lord Jesus Christ advis his disciple
[41:02] if you love me feed my
[41:05] flock so this is not about who we are
[41:09] but about how we love the flock of Jesus
[41:11] Christ because the ministry is
[41:14] edification until we come into the unity
[41:16] of the faith so each Minister had its
[41:21] own angle to present and I believe God
[41:24] is doing that amen so this is a is a uh
[41:27] five po Ministry just a onean Ministry
[41:30] so God put something in my heart and the
[41:32] last time I preached it was about uh
[41:35] remembering God's Covenant of Grace but
[41:39] tonight I will uh just preach as the
[41:41] Lord leads me the enforcer of the
[41:44] Covenant and remember that the life's
[41:48] journey of Abraham started in chapter 12
[41:51] and God spoke to Abraham and he said
[41:53] that separate yourself from your Kindred
[41:56] and your tongue and everything and God
[41:59] make it un
[42:01] contributional Covenant with Abraham
[42:03] amen so before the and this
[42:06] unconditional Covenant take effect he
[42:08] need to separate from unbelief right
[42:11] anything that will hinder you from the
[42:13] blessings of God you need to separate
[42:15] yourself amen and when he separate there
[42:18] is the condition you need to separate
[42:20] before the blessings come amen and and
[42:24] God made a covenant and conditional
[42:26] Covenant I will make your name great
[42:28] amen I will make your seed great
[42:31] everything God promised Abraham is UN
[42:35] conditional Covenant and the prophet
[42:37] said in this last day that it was true
[42:40] election yes he elected Abraham not
[42:44] because he is good or whatsoever it's
[42:46] just by the grace of God that he elected
[42:48] Abraham and we are the Seed of Abraham
[42:51] amen so our calling is by elections not
[42:54] by what we do or what we have or
[42:56] whatever we do it's just by God's
[43:00] election and and when God said I will
[43:03] bless you everything in the blessings
[43:05] our trials and whatever we've been
[43:07] through in life it is included in the
[43:10] blessing and sometimes we misinterpret
[43:13] blessings to be Prosperity or something
[43:16] or achievement but but
[43:21] blessing included in what we are going
[43:24] through in this life that's right that's
[43:26] right some through the water some
[43:29] through the flood some through the fire
[43:31] but that is through the blood our
[43:34] blessings is included in in the
[43:37] blessings of God our trials and testing
[43:39] are included amen because when God
[43:43] called Abraham Abraham is
[43:45] nothing he is a hidden he has no
[43:48] character whatsoever so when God
[43:51] blessing that is
[43:52] included the trial the testing is
[43:55] including the blessings to mold
[43:57] Abraham's character so actually
[44:00] Abraham's life's journey is a
[44:03] reflections of our journey because as
[44:06] Abraham saided we are on the same
[44:10] category so in Genesis chapter
[44:15] 17 this is where God confirm his
[44:18] Covenant with Abraham so we'll start in
[44:23] 17 verse1 he said and when Abraham was
[44:27] 90 years old and nine so in chapter 12
[44:30] he was only 75 years old when God gave
[44:33] him the promise so remember during that
[44:36] time there will he has already a lot of
[44:38] ups and downs in his journey
[44:43] amen but in chapter 17 God confirmed his
[44:47] Covenant and when Abraham was 90 years
[44:50] old and n9ine the Lord appeared to
[44:53] Abraham and said unto him I am the
[44:56] almight
[44:57] Mighty God walk before me and thou shalt
[45:01] be perfect appeared unto Abraham in the
[45:06] form of the message in a voice amen I am
[45:11] the Lord God Almighty walk before me and
[45:13] thou shalt be perfect so there is
[45:15] perfection in Walking with God and
[45:18] remember that Almighty in in in Hebrew
[45:21] it's called el shed I which mean the
[45:24] breasted one the strength giver and the
[45:28] sustainer in all those years that that
[45:31] Abraham travel and journey God then
[45:34] confirmed and and confirm his Covenant
[45:37] that it was he amen himself who
[45:42] sustained Abraham's journey through his
[45:45] ups and down he is sustainer he is the
[45:48] strength Giver he is the the enforcer
[45:52] amen he he is reminding Abraham that all
[45:57] those trials
[45:59] yes I not leaving you Abraham Hallelujah
[46:03] I am be with you in your trials just
[46:06] like something that's he said that you
[46:09] need to walk with me and thou shalt be
[46:11] perfect so our Perfection is Walking
[46:14] with God and walking is something that
[46:17] you need to
[46:18] align
[46:20] right yourself with the word that was
[46:23] given in your
[46:25] day you need to have harmony with the
[46:28] message of the hour praise God from
[46:31] Genesis to Revelation so that's why you
[46:34] can walk with God imperfectly if you
[46:37] have the harmony of the message of the
[46:39] hour from Genesis to
[46:43] Revelation Perfection is not by Good
[46:47] Conduct that's right
[46:51] amen Revelation first then Good Conduct
[46:55] follow
[46:57] am not Good Conduct then
[47:02] Perfection if you do a Good Conduct
[47:05] first then you can boast about yourself
[47:08] oh I made it I do this but by Revelation
[47:12] then good canu follow that's why we need
[47:15] to eat the word of God eat the word of
[47:18] God pray in the word of God and you
[47:20] don't just realize it you are
[47:23] manifesting the word of God the more you
[47:25] eat the word of God the more you become
[47:28] the
[47:28] word that's why there is always an
[47:31] Harmony if you walk with God that is
[47:32] your
[47:35] Perfection because when God the mighty
[47:37] angel of Revelation then come down and
[47:40] he set his foot upon the sea and upon
[47:42] the land with an open book in his
[47:46] heart and seven then there other the
[47:50] voices and that message was given to the
[47:52] seventh angel we cannot find any
[47:55] Scripture that said
[47:57] that after he he's coming down after he
[48:00] descended from Heaven there was no
[48:03] scripture that tell us that he leave the
[48:06] Earth
[48:08] amen when he said his putot upon the
[48:11] landine of the sea he
[48:13] remain until today he is with us because
[48:16] he promised I will be with you even in
[48:19] you until the end of the word no
[48:21] scripture that say he went back no he is
[48:24] here according to his promise I will be
[48:26] with you even in you until the end of
[48:28] the world so that's why whatever trouble
[48:31] in your life is don't forget God is in
[48:33] it whatever trial you are in God is in
[48:36] it whatever situation you are in he is
[48:40] in it because he is
[48:47] here that's why we are privileged
[48:50] people amen that's why I always say
[48:53] don't don't don't don't do party py
[48:56] party
[48:58] we are the most privileged people that's
[49:00] right why did we need to
[49:04] realize the message of the hour is so
[49:08] rich it is to shake us from all unbelief
[49:12] to shake us from all doubt we need to
[49:15] recognize our day and our message walk
[49:19] before me and thou shall be perfect our
[49:22] Perfection is the reveal word of the
[49:24] hour not by our good as I said before
[49:28] good cond follow if you have the good
[49:32] Revelation thank you
[49:36] Lord God is confirming his
[49:40] Covenant that's why he appeared unto
[49:42] Abraham and confirming his Abraham this
[49:45] is also in chapter that he changed
[49:48] Abraham to
[49:50] Abraham he put his
[49:53] name into Abraham
[49:57] yes he put his part in
[49:59] Abraham so that's why now
[50:02] Abraham is not expressing God yes sir
[50:07] because by believing the promise of God
[50:10] it was imputed unto him for his
[50:12] righteousness and the scripture
[50:15] said he who knows no sin becomes sin
[50:18] that we might become his very
[50:21] righteousness so he put a h apart of him
[50:25] in Abraham and he chain Sarai the I into
[50:29] the
[50:30] H he is no longer I I
[50:35] I it's become him him
[50:39] him amen it's no longer about us is
[50:43] about him he changed Sarah to Sarah and
[50:47] identify the age you need to change
[50:51] Sarai into Sara turn the eye into
[50:55] him glory and God requires the token
[50:58] Amen in these last days the token of the
[51:01] circumcision which is a type of the
[51:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost in our
[51:06] day this is a sealed mystery before the
[51:10] opening of the book but now it's a
[51:13] reveal into us the manifestation thank
[51:15] you Lord amen so we are now we are not
[51:20] reading in the Old
[51:23] Testament translation
[51:27] but we are reading in the open book amen
[51:32] that's right that everything that we can
[51:34] read in the Old Testament always reflect
[51:36] here y
[51:38] amen and I will make my Covenant between
[51:42] me and thee and multiply thee ex God is
[51:44] confirming his Covenant amen so if you
[51:47] are in the presence of God you will
[51:52] multiply amen it will take away your
[51:56] great it will take away your bitterness
[51:58] it will take away hatred it will take
[52:02] away jealousy it will take away whatever
[52:05] things that exalt himself against God
[52:09] that's right he will change he will
[52:11] multiply exceedingly thank you Lord
[52:14] don't struggle too much that's right
[52:17] just eat the word amen lay in the
[52:20] presence of the Lord read your Bible
[52:23] read your spoken word listen to the word
[52:26] don't be conscious of your fruit because
[52:29] fruit will follow if you just keep on
[52:32] eating the word that's why it's an open
[52:35] book it's free yes it's not for display
[52:40] it's not for something but it's for us
[52:43] Amen to enjoy the buffet thank you Lord
[52:47] other words for Buffet eat all you can
[52:50] that's
[52:51] right so it's up to you to grow you need
[52:55] to eat and eat and it don't
[52:58] stop Hallelujah so when we go to chapter
[53:02] 18 it was God
[53:05] himself revealed or come to Abraham and
[53:08] Sarah in human form
[53:12] yes only the prophet of God revealed
[53:15] this you cannot find this in any
[53:17] denominations or whatsoever it only
[53:19] takes the prophet of God in this last
[53:21] day that it was God in human form so it
[53:25] was not tupan form form it was not a
[53:27] glorified body because Juan form is a
[53:29] word body that you cannot eat cannot
[53:32] anything but this is human
[53:35] form because in God there is nothing
[53:38] impossible that's right he can spoke
[53:40] something into existing he can speak
[53:43] something out of
[53:45] nothing he can spoke a body into
[53:48] existence and he can spoke the body out
[53:50] of existence it was human body yes and
[53:54] it is a sign for our day that God once
[53:56] again come into our generation manifest
[53:59] in the body of Revelation 10 and speak
[54:02] unto the word speak the word unto us
[54:04] amen thank you Lord yes sir and God is
[54:09] continuing that even in the time of BOS
[54:12] God spoke flies into
[54:14] existence for one day spoke flies into
[54:17] existence old house and old G is full of
[54:21] flies right then few days he spoke out
[54:24] of his system those flies right
[54:27] then the following he spoke lies and all
[54:30] of Egypt full of lies then in one second
[54:34] he spoke out of existence he still the
[54:36] same God that's and that God is still he
[54:39] spoke squirrel into existence yes and
[54:42] spoke out the squ into existent he's
[54:45] still the same God hallelujah
[54:48] hallelujah so in in the Feast of the
[54:52] trumpet he said but the one that stayed
[54:55] with and talked Abraham Abraham called
[54:58] The Almighty gen one uh uh Elohim the
[55:02] alls sufficient one the self-existing
[55:04] one and Abraham called him Elohim and he
[55:07] sat down and eat with Abraham he drank
[55:09] and he was in human flesh and was the
[55:12] sign that he gave to Abraham amen so
[55:14] only the prophet identify that angel
[55:17] coming to Abraham as
[55:22] human amen now they were looking for a
[55:25] coming son a promised son Isaac 25 years
[55:28] on a long journey they had looked for it
[55:30] but they were at the end of The Journey
[55:33] God appeared in many forms amen as he
[55:36] has through the church ages he appeared
[55:38] many forms in light and so forth you
[55:40] know in many form in lights in pillar of
[55:44] pillar of amen he can appear in the form
[55:46] of a
[55:48] man amen and he spoke to Abraham by
[55:52] Voices but just before the coming son
[55:54] arrived now we've been through it and
[55:56] now you know I'm just rehearsing to get
[55:59] this to you that he changed the body of
[56:01] Abraham and Sarah immediately after this
[56:05] so they could receive the
[56:09] son this messages directly came from the
[56:12] mighty angel coming down with an open
[56:14] book and those
[56:17] mystery the hidden Mystery of the time
[56:20] of the of the Shadows of the older
[56:22] Testament was given to us oh Hallelujah
[56:26] no denomination can explain that God
[56:29] changed the body of Sarah and Abram in
[56:32] order to receive the son only in this
[56:36] generation and he typed that shadow in
[56:39] our generation that before we meet the
[56:42] promis Isaac there will be a body
[56:45] change oh God hallelujah our heraches
[56:47] our time that we we are suffering our
[56:50] old age some we cannot see
[56:54] some it will not last long
[56:56] amen praise the Lord it has a beginning
[56:59] it will be an end because the promise
[57:01] has come notice the last sign that they
[57:05] got before the son arrived was Jehovah
[57:07] talking to them in the form of a man
[57:11] amen so this story in Genesis showing us
[57:13] the mystery of this end time age of what
[57:16] we also promised the day that would
[57:17] happen to Abraham's Royal seed what
[57:20] happened then will happen again because
[57:22] history will repeat itself God has a
[57:25] pattern he cannot change his pattern
[57:27] that's why we can say he's the same
[57:30] yesterday today and be
[57:35] forever praise the Lord that's why we
[57:37] can have the consolation if we can see
[57:39] the type there's always if you can see
[57:41] the shadow there is always a
[57:44] reality so this was the secret coming of
[57:47] the Lord to Abraham and this is also the
[57:49] secret coming of the Lord to the
[57:52] bride to Abraham's seed
[57:56] but we know that the story doesn't stop
[57:59] in Genesis 18 so we will continue that a
[58:01] little while so let's go to Genesis
[58:04] Chapter 18 where God appeared in human
[58:08] flesh and the scripture say and the Lord
[58:11] appeared to him in plain of Mumy and he
[58:14] sat in the tth door In the Heat of the
[58:17] day Abraham is
[58:21] waiting God already appeared to him and
[58:24] spoke to him that he is confirming his
[58:26] promise so when we hear the word of God
[58:28] we need to be aware we need to watch
[58:30] every born every days in our life we
[58:33] need to to watch something Supernatural
[58:36] happen will take place in our life while
[58:38] waiting yes for the Fulfillment of the
[58:40] coming of the Lord amen we need to wait
[58:44] amen don't struggle with anything in
[58:47] this word your life your career
[58:49] whatsoever because as the scripture said
[58:52] seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
[58:54] these things shall be added unto you but
[58:57] be aware of his presence he is waiting
[59:00] at the T door he's waiting and waiting
[59:02] and waiting for the promise of God to
[59:04] make manifest in his life that's right
[59:08] he was not thinking about his livelihood
[59:10] he was not thinking about lot or
[59:12] whatsoever he is
[59:14] looking and he lift up his eye and look
[59:17] and low three men stood by him and when
[59:19] he saw them he ran to meet them from the
[59:21] tent door and bow himself towards the
[59:24] ground
[59:26] remember in verse three he saw
[59:29] them when he saw them he was so
[59:32] excited are you excited to be in the
[59:34] house of the Lord tonight
[59:37] amen yes sir if God Appears to you in
[59:39] the realing of his word you need to be
[59:42] excited not only on Sunday but even in
[59:45] Wednesday you need to be excited amen
[59:47] you don't you don't need to wait for the
[59:50] to the door to open to the Deacon to
[59:51] stand at the door you need to be in the
[59:53] house of the Lord that's right that's
[59:55] why he recruit the tree coming but he
[59:57] said in verse three and I said my
[1:00:00] Lord as we always say he was not a
[1:00:05] trinitarian amen he saw God made
[1:00:07] manifest In the Flesh he identified
[1:00:10] because he already God already appeared
[1:00:12] unto him God is always talking to him
[1:00:15] have fellowship with him so when they
[1:00:17] come the tree come he
[1:00:20] recognize amen and he said my Lord amen
[1:00:24] it's all capital right
[1:00:28] I now have found favor in thy sight pass
[1:00:31] not by I pray thee from thy
[1:00:33] sermon and let Ally water I pray you be
[1:00:37] peit and wash your feet and rest
[1:00:38] yourself under the tree and I will Peach
[1:00:42] a morcel of bread and comfort ye your
[1:00:45] hearts after that ye shall pass on for
[1:00:48] therefore are you come to your servant

[1:02:52] you're proning me
[1:02:59] amen and I will pit a morel I bread and
[1:03:02] comfort your hearts and so Abraham has
[1:03:07] so much things to do he pit the tent he
[1:03:10] make a morsel he he make something like
[1:03:13] he's too
[1:03:16] busy we need to be busy serving the lord
[1:03:19] amen don't give chance to Satan to give
[1:03:21] us you know different mindset different
[1:03:25] problems for all of that if you stop
[1:03:27] serving the lord Satan so enjoy it y he
[1:03:32] will bombard you with all negativity in
[1:03:34] your mind and all discouragement but if
[1:03:37] you keep on per persuade your yourself
[1:03:41] encourage yourself even if you don't
[1:03:43] feel like it Encourage
[1:03:47] Yourself sir because even if you don't
[1:03:50] feel like it doesn't mean that God is
[1:03:52] not with you that's right but remember
[1:03:55] when he come down he didn't return
[1:03:57] back he stayed with you oh thank you
[1:04:01] Lord even though how much we search the
[1:04:03] scripture what is the scripture that say
[1:04:06] he leave the
[1:04:07] Earth no scripture
[1:04:11] amen after he come down he is with us
[1:04:16] praise the Lord thank you Lord he's
[1:04:18] ministering to each and every one of us
[1:04:20] he give us
[1:04:23] encouragement and Abraham he into the
[1:04:26] tent unto Sarah and said make ready
[1:04:28] quick three measures of meal and need
[1:04:30] and make cakes and and Abraham ran into
[1:04:33] the herb
[1:04:34] and so Abraham become hyper oh I need to
[1:04:38] do this I need to do that he become so
[1:04:40] nervous y That's why when you are in the
[1:04:42] Pres God you need to be nervous oh I
[1:04:44] need to do something for God I need to
[1:04:46] do this I need to keep yourself busy yes
[1:04:49] he was attending the ministry then he
[1:04:51] went to the kitchen Sarah
[1:04:53] Sarah but Sarah is in his right position
[1:04:57] that's right yeah that's why the
[1:05:00] blessing come because Sarah is always
[1:05:01] way in the kitchen she is listening to
[1:05:05] every
[1:05:05] conversation because Faith cometh by
[1:05:08] hearing and not hearing by the word of
[1:05:09] God he don't want to miss what is the
[1:05:12] message of the hour she don't want to
[1:05:15] miss anything so that's why although
[1:05:16] she's working she's listening that's
[1:05:19] right
[1:05:26] verse 7even and Abraham ran into the
[1:05:28] herb and fetch a cup tender and good and
[1:05:30] gave it unto the young man and hastened
[1:05:32] to dress
[1:05:34] it do you think how many hour will take
[1:05:37] to dress the
[1:05:39] cup but he's doing
[1:05:42] it he was so
[1:05:44] excited but you notice how Abraham made
[1:05:47] haste to service the Lord he didn't slot
[1:05:49] around and miss the
[1:05:54] church because the service start he was
[1:05:57] already in his seat
[1:05:59] praying 30 minutes before the service
[1:06:01] was doing service to the Lord he's
[1:06:04] praising God Amen is he's doing
[1:06:08] something yeah very good but during this
[1:06:12] time the purpose is something we
[1:06:17] yet the Lord just keep silence he allow
[1:06:21] Abraham to do the service
[1:06:27] and sometimes if we feel
[1:06:30] dry in our journey and sometimes we feel
[1:06:34] dry we feel discouraged just keep on
[1:06:38] serving because when God called you he
[1:06:40] didn't Guaranty that you will always be
[1:06:43] happy
[1:06:45] amen trials is in part remember trial is
[1:06:50] part of your
[1:06:52] blessing does it count it all joy when
[1:06:55] you fall into diverse places count it
[1:06:58] all
[1:06:59] joy so that is the secret of your trial
[1:07:03] count it all joy because all things
[1:07:05] works together for good to them that
[1:07:07] love the Lord all things not part all
[1:07:11] things is for your own good so the Lord
[1:07:15] is silence about this purpose of his
[1:07:16] coming he allow Abraham to serve him
[1:07:20] with haste with all his might he servant
[1:07:24] yes
[1:07:31] and he took butter and milk and the cup
[1:07:33] which he had dressed and set it before
[1:07:35] them and he stood by them under the tree
[1:07:37] and they did it he just keept on
[1:07:42] looking why they are
[1:07:45] eating he is already enjoying it that's
[1:07:49] right
[1:07:53] yes well you are Ving God somebody is
[1:07:59] blessed by the way you
[1:08:02] act I am blessed if I see people around
[1:08:05] here before the service start they
[1:08:08] already praying kneeling I'm already
[1:08:10] blessed
[1:08:15] amen and some of them is driving 3 hours
[1:08:18] 4
[1:08:20] hours ready in the church while somebody
[1:08:25] that is only 30
[1:08:27] minutes are late
[1:08:35] amen so that's a
[1:08:37] blessing amen yes you may not know it
[1:08:42] but your sacrifice is always be a
[1:08:44] blessing to somebody else that's
[1:08:48] right Amen in verse
[1:08:53] 9 he show Abraham's purpose and they
[1:08:58] said unto him where is Sarah thy wife
[1:09:02] and he said behold in the tent so their
[1:09:06] visit was specifically with Sarah
[1:09:11] because there can be no coming of Isaac
[1:09:14] until Sarah is first dealt with in a
[1:09:17] certain way amen amen so his visitation
[1:09:21] is not for Abraham but for Sarah
[1:09:25] because Sarah is receiving seed for 25
[1:09:30] years and come to the point that he is
[1:09:33] she's
[1:09:35] doubting the promises of Abraham so
[1:09:38] that's why he told Abraham go to
[1:09:42] Hagar she's receiving seed but she was
[1:09:45] not conceiving seed so it will take an
[1:09:48] angel visitation to give her strength so
[1:09:52] that she can conceive amen was in Paul
[1:09:56] said in the book of Hebrews chapter
[1:09:58] 11 and Sarah conceived seed God gave him
[1:10:04] strength to conceive seed because he
[1:10:06] knows the one who made a promise is
[1:10:09] faithful that's right so after the the
[1:10:12] Angel's visitation it gave her strength
[1:10:14] to conceive because that was not an
[1:10:17] ordinary man who can discern the thought
[1:10:19] of his heart he was away from the tent
[1:10:23] and he was listening to the conversation
[1:10:25] he was listening to the fellowship amen
[1:10:28] while he was listening is
[1:10:30] create a faith in her
[1:10:33] heart although she was doubting but when
[1:10:37] God in the form of a man discern her
[1:10:40] heart it creates strength for her to
[1:10:44] conceive amen and he said I will
[1:10:47] certainly return according to the time
[1:10:49] of life I will certainly amen God is
[1:10:53] confirming his promise amen not only to
[1:10:56] Abraham but now he's mentioning
[1:10:59] Sarah return according to the time of
[1:11:02] life after he had left them the form
[1:11:04] human flesh he would return to them
[1:11:06] again to perform the
[1:11:08] promise both to Abraham and Sarah they
[1:11:12] need to turn from an old man old woman
[1:11:17] to a young man to a young woman in order
[1:11:21] for the promise to take place amen amen
[1:11:24] yes
[1:11:26] amen so it was clear because it was the
[1:11:29] prophet who got the vision that there is
[1:11:32] really a changing of the body before the
[1:11:34] promised son came amen hallelujah
[1:11:38] denomination will explain oh for God
[1:11:40] nothing is impossible that's
[1:11:42] it but for us God changed their body
[1:11:47] into young man and a young woman in
[1:11:49] order to conceive which the prophet type
[1:11:52] that before we meet the Lord in the air
[1:11:54] there will be a changing of our body
[1:11:55] because flesh and blood cannot inherit
[1:11:57] to the kingdom of God God need to change
[1:12:00] it before we meet the Lord in the
[1:12:03] air praise the Lord and he said I will
[1:12:07] certainly return according to the time
[1:12:10] of life and low Sarah thy wife shall
[1:12:12] have a son and Sarah heard it in the
[1:12:14] tent which was behind
[1:12:16] him now Abraham and Sarah were all were
[1:12:20] old and well stricken in age and it
[1:12:22] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[1:12:24] of the women therefore Sarah within
[1:12:26] herself saying after I am walks old
[1:12:28] shall have pleasure my Lord being
[1:12:31] old It seems
[1:12:34] impossible but God With God nothing is
[1:12:36] impossible that's right he can do
[1:12:38] whatever he want because God is
[1:12:40] Sovereign amen it is he's doing
[1:12:43] something according to the good pleasure
[1:12:45] of his
[1:12:46] will Hallelujah and the Lord said unto
[1:12:49] Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying
[1:12:51] shall I ofely bear a child which I'm old
[1:12:55] is anything too hard for the Lord at the
[1:12:57] time appointed I will return unto thee
[1:12:59] according to the time of life and Sh
[1:13:02] shall have a son amen God when God speak
[1:13:05] a promise he is faithful to forgive the
[1:13:09] promise I will certainly return
[1:13:11] according to the time of life
[1:13:13] amen so the promise must come to this
[1:13:16] woman who saw The Secret of Heart
[1:13:19] revealed by this one there is no other
[1:13:21] woman that can fulfill This Promise amen
[1:13:24] amen amen This Promise is directly
[1:13:28] connected to this woman Sarah and so
[1:13:30] Sarah shows the mystery of the body
[1:13:32] chain before the appearing of the
[1:13:34] promised son Isaac you see that each
[1:13:37] woman in the Bible show a portion of the
[1:13:40] mystery of the Bride of this hour that's
[1:13:43] why we can see that the Old Testament is
[1:13:45] a sealed mystery in types and shadows
[1:13:49] but the opening of the seals is revealed
[1:13:51] those character in The Bible just like
[1:13:54] Ruth shows the four stages of end time
[1:13:56] gentle bride of this hour by her
[1:14:00] deciding by her
[1:14:02] serving by resting and after that the
[1:14:05] reward Ruth also showed the mystery of
[1:14:07] the marriage at the Harvest time in the
[1:14:09] evening time amen hallelujah this is the
[1:14:13] evening time where the marriage took
[1:14:16] place Revelation 19 the bribe has made
[1:14:20] herself ready amen amen
[1:14:23] hallelujah Rahab is also a type of the
[1:14:26] message of the hour believer remember
[1:14:28] that heab is a ill Fame woman praise God
[1:14:32] with a with a bad reputation is she was
[1:14:34] a
[1:14:35] prostitute she don't really meet the
[1:14:38] prophet but she was hearing yes what is
[1:14:41] being done in Israel she heard that
[1:14:45] there was God praise God who opened the
[1:14:48] Red Sea there was God in the pillar of P
[1:14:50] who lead the people out and she was
[1:14:52] listening and she was listening and deep
[1:14:54] down in in her heart she believe it and
[1:14:57] she's expecting maybe someday I can meet
[1:15:00] that that that Fellowship I can meet
[1:15:02] that Believers that can share to be the
[1:15:04] message of the hour because I have heard
[1:15:07] I heard I heard something is is is
[1:15:10] taking
[1:15:12] place she was a type of the message of
[1:15:15] the hour today we may not had been with
[1:15:18] a Propet in
[1:15:21] flesh cuz I received the message in 1985
[1:15:26] so when I received the message to be I I
[1:15:29] read about the prospet visit South
[1:15:33] Africa all the manifestations of the
[1:15:35] prophet and sign and I don't really know
[1:15:38] it but tears running out my te I keep on
[1:15:41] crying and crying and I believe in it
[1:15:44] amen although I don't see I I I don't
[1:15:47] see phally the prophet but the way he
[1:15:50] present the message the hour and
[1:15:52] testimony it keeps my heart it gives my
[1:15:55] heard something say that's
[1:15:57] real and when the prophet said he always
[1:15:59] humbl himself the presence of Lord Lord
[1:16:01] I want that kind of spirit in my life
[1:16:04] amen I want to experience that Lord in
[1:16:07] my life just like Rahab he heard she
[1:16:11] heard the Mighty God is moving among the
[1:16:14] Israelite I see her even though she
[1:16:16] don't see it but deep down in heart
[1:16:18] she's
[1:16:19] longing maybe that God that they are
[1:16:23] serving the god that they are are they
[1:16:26] they
[1:16:27] preaching will reveal it to
[1:16:34] me it is important to note that Rahab
[1:16:37] was called in the time of the
[1:16:39] Harvest at the evening time and received
[1:16:42] the token which blind well with the
[1:16:44] third pool Ministry see didn't really
[1:16:49] meet the
[1:16:51] prophet but when she heard that there
[1:16:53] was a spy bringing the message of the
[1:16:55] hour she received the message of the
[1:16:58] hour she belied it and she hide
[1:17:04] it she not really hiding the message but
[1:17:07] the message is hiding her amen because
[1:17:11] the message apply this token and when
[1:17:13] the Judgment strike we will pass over
[1:17:15] you apply the
[1:17:17] token so anybody in Jericho that want to
[1:17:21] be saved need to go to rahab's house
[1:17:24] that's
[1:17:25] because Rahab is the final voice to the
[1:17:27] final AIDS unless they come into the
[1:17:30] roof of Rahab they will be destroyed
[1:17:33] they will be judged but Rahab even
[1:17:35] though he don't see the prophet he
[1:17:37] believed the message of the prophet and
[1:17:39] applied the
[1:17:40] token and everybody need salvation need
[1:17:43] to go to Rahab because Rahab at that
[1:17:47] time is the final voice to the final AGS
[1:17:50] amen no other place people can be saved
[1:17:54] except in the place of
[1:18:01] Rahab God look at
[1:18:04] Rahab

[1:18:25] through the blood and saw her completely
[1:18:27] Justified she was clean she was holy she
[1:18:30] was blameless I have a church without
[1:18:32] spot without wrinkle because she applied
[1:18:35] the token God is being she was justified

[1:22:32] it that's the only way that you can
[1:22:34] conceive just like Sarah when she
[1:22:36] believed the the word of the Angel it
[1:22:39] gave her strength to conceive just like
[1:22:42] Mary when the Angels visit the should
[1:22:44] come and give her the word it give her
[1:22:46] strength to conceive amen the same with
[1:22:50] with uh with uh Samson's mother she was
[1:22:54] baren she cannot do it but when the
[1:22:56] angel uh come unto him and the angel
[1:22:59] said Thou Art baren and you can bear not
[1:23:04] but you will bear a son and she will be
[1:23:07] a Nazarite from the day he was born
[1:23:09] until the day he will till he die he
[1:23:12] will be a nazarine and it give her
[1:23:14] strength to conceive Amen in this
[1:23:17] generation we have an angel visitation
[1:23:20] in our day and it give us strength for
[1:23:22] the body changed it give us
[1:23:24] encouragement to move on because the
[1:23:26] message is not an accident that comes to
[1:23:28] you Hallelujah it was not given to any
[1:23:31] other woman except for Sarah only this
[1:23:35] message is not given to anybody else but
[1:23:38] for the Bride of Jesus Christ praise the
[1:23:41] Lord so in Genesis
[1:23:44] 20 is something that take place in
[1:23:47] between chapter 18 which is the
[1:23:49] appearing of the Lord in chapter 21
[1:23:51] which is the coming of Isaac
[1:23:56] amen so between the ministry of Bram and
[1:23:59] we meet the Lord in the air we see the
[1:24:00] event of Genesis 20 is take place right
[1:24:03] there in this two event restoration of
[1:24:08] Sara between the appearing of the Lord
[1:24:11] and restoration or the coming of Isaac
[1:24:15] amen so the whole plan and promise of
[1:24:17] God would have failed right
[1:24:20] there Hallelujah
[1:24:27] it is to do with Sarah chapter 20
[1:24:30] remember when God
[1:24:31] appear to Abraham chapter 18 and verse
[1:24:35] 19 he went to Sodom the two Angel went
[1:24:37] to
[1:24:39] Sodom and proclaimed judgment but one
[1:24:42] stayed with Abraham right and Abraham
[1:24:45] become a coworker with God he stand in
[1:24:48] the Gap that's right because God is
[1:24:50] going to judge Sodom and he he he
[1:24:53] commune he B with if you can find 50
[1:24:56] will you no 50 40 10 and God don't judge
[1:25:00] it so in verse
[1:25:02] 20 it say
[1:25:05] that Sarah was
[1:25:08] Straten with the seed of another men
[1:25:11] that was not her husband's
[1:25:14] seed she was treaten in verse 20 Abraham
[1:25:18] travel and go
[1:25:20] to and to go to meet aimc
[1:25:26] and Abraham was afraid and said that if
[1:25:29] aik the king will ask what is our
[1:25:32] relationship just tell tell him that you
[1:25:35] are my
[1:25:39] sister verse 20 and Abraham journeyed
[1:25:42] from then toward the South Country and
[1:25:44] dwelt between cadis and S and sourn in
[1:25:47] gerar and Abraham said of Sarah his wife
[1:25:50] she is my sister and ab king of J sent
[1:25:52] and took
[1:25:56] Sarah you remember even though he lied
[1:26:01] it is still part of the program of God
[1:26:03] Amen because God is going to express his
[1:26:07] attributes exactly but for a man like us
[1:26:12] we are so judgmental ah God don't like
[1:26:16] God hate lies no one can go to heaven if
[1:26:19] you
[1:26:22] lie we are quick to judge
[1:26:25] amen but God is longsuffering that he's
[1:26:28] not willing that anyone should Pierce
[1:26:29] but come into repentance thank you
[1:26:32] Lord but God came to aik in a dream so
[1:26:37] he took Sarah and he want to marry Sarah
[1:26:42] but God came to aimc in a Dream by night
[1:26:44] and said to him behold thou art a dead
[1:26:48] man for a woman which thou Hast taken
[1:26:50] for she is a man's wife but aimc had not
[1:26:53] come near her and he said Lord will thou
[1:26:57] slay also a righteous
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:00] Nation so right here aim would have
[1:27:02] destroyed the future nation of Israel
[1:27:05] that would come to Isaac if he had taken
[1:27:08] Sarah for his wife and live with her she
[1:27:11] can do anything with
[1:27:13] Sarah because he knows that
[1:27:19] Sarah is a virgin
[1:27:24] not being married or not anything so
[1:27:28] he's free to marry Sarah right anyway
[1:27:31] Abraham already told him that she was my
[1:27:34] sister so ack was
[1:27:38] excited there's no confusion there's no
[1:27:41] hindrance she's a virgin praise God and
[1:27:44] I'm going to marry him marry
[1:27:47] her but God knows everything that's
[1:27:50] right so that's why he he but a b he he
[1:27:54] said unto and he said unto me she is my
[1:27:56] sister and she even herself said he is
[1:27:59] my brother in the Integrity of my heart
[1:28:01] and innocency my hands have have I done
[1:28:04] this so he was honest amen right and God
[1:28:08] said unto him in a dream yeah I know
[1:28:11] that thou did this Integrity of their
[1:28:13] heart for I also will heal thee from
[1:28:15] sinning against me therefore suffered I
[1:28:17] Thee not to touch
[1:28:19] her notice how aimik thought it was his
[1:28:22] own restrain and Integrity that he
[1:28:25] hadn't touch s up to that
[1:28:28] point said the Integrity of my heart
[1:28:31] anyway he said that she was my sister
[1:28:34] but it was actually the Lord that had
[1:28:36] put a boundary on Sarah that we heeld
[1:28:39] him that's right amen God allow
[1:28:43] everything to happen even in your
[1:28:46] failure God still is on the Move God
[1:28:49] still is in control of the situation
[1:28:52] even though we fail and sometime we have
[1:28:54] failure but still God is in control of
[1:28:57] every situation praise the Lord now
[1:28:59] therefore restore the man his wife who
[1:29:01] he is a prophet and he shall pray for
[1:29:03] thee and thou shall live and if thou
[1:29:05] restore her
[1:29:06] not no thou thou shall surely die thou
[1:29:11] and all that are dying notice how this
[1:29:14] is to do with restoring this
[1:29:17] woman restore to her his wife amen there
[1:29:22] is a restoration message
[1:29:25] yes sir amen we are being restored by
[1:29:27] Malachi
[1:29:28] 4 amen unto our
[1:29:32] fathers Hallelujah and that is what this
[1:29:35] message of Malachi for was to commission
[1:29:37] to do this hour to restore all things
[1:29:40] restore the man his wife so there is an
[1:29:44] enforcer of the Covenant irregardless of
[1:29:47] their failure God don't look at the
[1:29:49] failure but God is enforcing his
[1:29:52] Covenant to Abra
[1:29:59] restore Amen to him his wife
[1:30:05] yes that's a powerful command that's
[1:30:08] right restore because he is the enforcer
[1:30:12] of the Covenant he gave the Covenant and
[1:30:14] he enforced his Covenant that's
[1:30:17] right so this SP King had no real choice
[1:30:20] in the matter but to restore her
[1:30:26] God was enforcing the restoration of
[1:30:29] Sarah to Abraham in regardless of their
[1:30:32] failure and of them outside of their
[1:30:36] rightful position
[1:30:38] right that's how God gave his Covenant
[1:30:43] yes when he died for us he don't take
[1:30:47] away anything it regardless of our trial
[1:30:51] as I said it is part of our blessing
[1:30:53] amen
[1:30:55] he always keep his promise thank you
[1:30:58] Lord Genesis 20:8 therefore aimik rose
[1:31:01] up early in the morning and called his
[1:31:02] servant and told those things in their
[1:31:04] ears and the men were so afraid and they
[1:31:06] had very reason to be afraid that's
[1:31:09] right because the judge of all the Earth
[1:31:11] was in the land to enforce the promise
[1:31:13] that he had sworn to Abraham and Sarah
[1:31:15] amen he is the enforcer he will perish
[1:31:19] if they will not do so this is all
[1:31:20] showing that he's doing this in the hour
[1:31:22] to enforce the promise of ab Abraham's
[1:31:24] Faith seed of the same one who had seen
[1:31:27] him reveal the secret of the hearts in
[1:31:29] this day and are between the coming of
[1:31:31] the Lord in human flesh just before the
[1:31:33] destruction of Sodom and the coming of
[1:31:35] the promised Isaac he is enforcing the
[1:31:38] Restorations of s amen and regardless of
[1:31:42] our failures God is enforcing his
[1:31:45] Covenant and one of these days
[1:31:47] hallelujah so don't look at our
[1:31:49] shortcomings you may fail don't get
[1:31:52] discouraged because your failure God is
[1:31:55] always in it he's trying to mold
[1:31:58] something he's trying to show praise God
[1:32:00] in the midst of your situation he is
[1:32:02] still in control amen even though how
[1:32:05] poor you are you are suffering whatever
[1:32:07] suffering you can whatever s situation
[1:32:10] God is still in
[1:32:12] control just walk by the revelation of
[1:32:15] the war as he said to Abraham I am the
[1:32:17] almighty God come and walk with me and
[1:32:19] thou shalt be perfect our Perfection is
[1:32:22] believing the word of God
[1:32:25] not in our works that we show or hard
[1:32:27] work that's why James said that work is
[1:32:31] Faith Express
[1:32:37] amen praise
[1:32:39] God so I will just finish this uh few
[1:32:43] verse and we'll be
[1:32:44] closing then a called Abraham and said
[1:32:47] unto him what hast thou done unto us and
[1:32:51] what have I offended thee that thou Hast
[1:32:54] brought on me and on my kingdom a great
[1:32:57] sin thou Hast done Deeds unto me that ow
[1:33:01] not to be done
[1:33:05] right he was blaming
[1:33:08] Abraham because Abraham
[1:33:11] lied and Abraham said because I thought
[1:33:15] surely the fear of the Lord is not in
[1:33:17] this place and they will slay me for my
[1:33:19] wife's sake so Abraham is honest enough
[1:33:22] to confess his sin
[1:33:24] we just need to be honest with God Amen
[1:33:27] if we fail we just confess and Lord I
[1:33:29] fail you Lord just give me one more
[1:33:31] chance just let me stand Lord in my plan
[1:33:35] I'm failure sometime I've been stubborn
[1:33:37] I I I do this and I suffer myself I
[1:33:40] suffer within my family but give me one
[1:33:42] more time lord
[1:33:45] yes amen and it came to pass when God
[1:33:48] caused me to wonder from my father's
[1:33:50] house that I said unto her this is thy
[1:33:52] kindness which thou H has show unto me
[1:33:56] at every place whether we shall come say
[1:33:58] of me he is my brother and aimc took
[1:34:01] sheep and oxen and made servant and
[1:34:04] women servant and gave them unto Abraham
[1:34:06] and restored him Sarah his wife and aimc
[1:34:12] said behold my land is before thee dwell
[1:34:15] where it pleased thee and unto sarrow he
[1:34:18] said behold I have given thy brother a
[1:34:21] thousand pieces of silver beh behold he
[1:34:24] is one to thee a covering of the eye and
[1:34:27] to all that are with thee and with all
[1:34:30] others thus she was reproved 17 and
[1:34:34] Abraham prayed unto God and God healed
[1:34:36] aimik unto his wife and his made servant
[1:34:40] and they bear children and the Lord had
[1:34:43] fast Clos up all the wombs of the House
[1:34:44] of AMC because of Sarah's wife so he can
[1:34:48] open a womb to a seed and he can close a
[1:34:51] womb to a seed so if you receive the
[1:34:53] seed of the world is our it only because
[1:34:56] he has opened your womb and for no other
[1:34:59] reason so can we stand tonight
[1:35:03] amen God is orchestrating everything in
[1:35:07] our life we just need to recognize the
[1:35:10] presence of the Lord be honest and
[1:35:13] sincere and if you if you can see
[1:35:15] something in your life that's not
[1:35:17] pleasing unto the Lord you can come unto
[1:35:20] him Lord forgive me amen amen I want to
[1:35:24] be a better servant I want to be a
[1:35:26] better Christian just forgive me Lord
[1:35:28] give me one more chance amen sometimes I
[1:35:31] I overlook your goodness I overlook your
[1:35:34] kindness I overlook how you did to me I
[1:35:37] overlook that you are in our presence
[1:35:40] yes but when if we come in recognition
[1:35:43] God will use those people around you to
[1:35:46] bless you amen remember abik and Sarah
[1:35:49] he said behold I have given thy brother
[1:35:51] a thousand pieces of silver thank you
[1:35:54] amen God is blessing us amen but we need
[1:35:59] just to seek the kingdom of God first
[1:36:03] because everything that we need God

[1:36:07] it we just need to walk and be perfect
[1:36:11] in his sight amen walk in the harmony of
[1:36:14] his
[1:36:15] Revelation and the Bible said that uh

[1:36:21] coming the Bible said that Abraham's
[1:36:24] body was As Good As Dead As Dead that's
[1:36:26] right and Sarah's womb was
[1:36:29] dead but he staggered not at the promise
[1:36:32] of God through unbelief but was strong
[1:36:35] giving praise to God Amen know that what
[1:36:38] he promised he will do that's the way we
[1:36:41] got to and his seed does the same thing
[1:36:44] his promised seed Royal seed believes
[1:36:48] the same thing amen because we are
[1:36:51] Abraham's seed If Abraham believed the
[1:36:55] promise of God and he staggered not of
[1:36:57] the promise of God and if you are the
[1:37:00] Seed of Abraham you will do the same
[1:37:03] thing Hallelujah now look she laugh and

[1:42:11] covenant to Abraham but there was a
[1:42:14] part that God had to go he gave the
[1:42:18] promise to Abraham but it's going to be
[1:42:20] manifested in who in Sarah that's right
[1:42:24] so God had to move on her heart Hebrews
