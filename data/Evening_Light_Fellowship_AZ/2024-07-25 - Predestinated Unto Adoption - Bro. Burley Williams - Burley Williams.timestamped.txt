[39:32] why we wait upon you Lord to give us
[39:34] something that can be given to your
[39:37] people and may Lord when we leave the
[39:39] service tonight we can say I see me in
[39:43] the scriptures I see me in this great
[39:46] Plan of Redemption I see my place I see
[39:49] where God is positioning me I see where
[39:52] God is working on me not not my wife not
[39:56] my children but me yes because that's
[39:58] where it starts Lord in us as an
[40:01] individual because this is not a group
[40:03] effort lord it's an individual race
[40:06] where each one of us have to have that
[40:08] personal relationship with you as it was
[40:11] on the day of Pentecost when the Holy
[40:14] Spirit fell it said it set upon each of
[40:16] them so each one of them have their own
[40:19] personal relationship with you father
[40:21] and Lord that's the way that it has to
[40:23] be
[40:24] today and maybe oh God some of us we
[40:27] done possessed many things in our life
[40:29] and and placed and situations in our
[40:33] life that you put us and showed us where
[40:34] we're at but we all just like in the
[40:38] time of Joshua some had their
[40:40] inheritance then he said now you got to
[40:42] help your brothers to get theirs so that
[40:45] shows uh when we come to a maturity in
[40:47] our lives Lord we can look back and see
[40:50] where our brothers need help where our
[40:52] sister need help and what we can all
[40:54] help and benefit from one another so
[40:57] Lord we leave everything into thy hands
[40:59] tonight and we give you the glory in the
[41:02] name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless
[41:05] you tonight it's good to be here in the
[41:07] house of the Lord yes sir uh we like to
[41:11] immediately go to the scripture
[41:12] Ephesians chapter one we bring you
[41:15] greetings from the church back home that
[41:17] my Deacon told me to greet you guys we
[41:20] just another portion of the body of
[41:21] Christ waiting on the coming of the Lord
[41:23] amen so we just thankful for the
[41:26] opportunity brother
[41:28] uh allow us to be here to uh share the
[41:31] words of Life With You amen I was just
[41:34] listening to what brother Tony said
[41:36] about the heat here I told but Ron you
[41:39] have to be born in a place like this to
[41:40] deal with this kind of heat it's just
[41:43] unbelievable but God bless
[41:47] you but there's a harder place we trying
[41:49] to
[41:52] escape this is just an air conditioning
[41:55] that place but we just think thank God
[41:57] the for able to be here that's right
[41:59] Ephesians chapter 1 and we'll go to
[42:02] verse
[42:05] three
[42:07] amen we'll just go to verse one I let to
[42:10] go to verse three I'm sorry blessed be
[42:12] the God and Father of the Lord Jesus
[42:15] Christ who has blessed us with all
[42:17] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[42:21] in Christ Jesus we know the prophet said
[42:24] Heavenly plac in Christ Jesus is a
[42:26] believer's position in
[42:28] Christ according as he has chosen Us in
[42:31] him before the foundation of the world
[42:33] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[42:36] before him in love having predestinated
[42:39] us into the adoption of children by
[42:42] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[42:45] good pleasure of his will amen you may
[42:48] be seated and may the Lord add a
[42:50] blessing to the reading of his word and
[42:52] I like to turn to uh also turn to Ruth
[42:55] chapter 4
[43:00] sister Sandy the church been lifting you
[43:03] up in prayer you like for you to know
[43:06] that
[43:07] amen how many you believe prayer changes
[43:11] thing if you believe it just receive it
[43:15] don't doubt it just believe it praise
[43:18] the Lord amen cuz you it's a beautiful
[43:21] thing once you pray God hear you
[43:24] instantly amen you might I think he did
[43:28] but he hears you instantly that's right
[43:30] praise the Lord that's what he told
[43:31] Daniel when you first prayed we heard
[43:33] you God heard you but we had to do a
[43:36] little fighting to get here but we're
[43:37] here now so uh we just believe in a all
[43:42] Miracle performing God that's right amen
[43:46] Ruth 4:
[43:49] 11 it said all the people that was in
[43:51] the gate and the Elder said we Are
[43:54] Witnesses the Lord make the woman is
[43:57] come into thine house like Rachel and
[44:00] like Leah which too did build the house
[44:02] of Israel and do thou worthily in EPA
[44:07] and be famous in
[44:08] Bethlehem and let thy house be like the
[44:11] house of per whom Tamar baring to Judah
[44:15] of the seed which the Lord shall give
[44:17] thee of this young woman so Boaz took
[44:20] Ruth and she was his wife and when he
[44:23] went into her the lord gave her
[44:26] conception and she buried son amen
[44:29] praise the
[44:30] Lord uh we were just going try to uh
[44:35] take a thought tonight uh predestinated
[44:38] into adoption and my subtitle is
[44:41] Ruth amen uh I'm not as kind of quick as
[44:46] I used to be it take a little while to
[44:47] get off the
[44:48] Runway but we'll just see what the Lord
[44:51] will do and we ain't trying to bring you
[44:53] nothing new we just only bringing you
[44:56] what has already been preached by the
[44:59] messenger of this hour amen and you
[45:03] know when I look into the message uh I
[45:06] remember one place brother Brandon said
[45:08] that when he look into the word of God
[45:10] he said I want to see what's in it for
[45:13] me I'm the same way I want to see what's
[45:17] in it for me where I'm at and what God
[45:20] wants and to do in my life amen and when
[45:23] I look into the scripture that's what I
[45:24] want to see so I think for the message
[45:27] of the hour because uh the characters
[45:31] that been uh magnified upon in the
[45:34] scripture but about preaching on Ruth
[45:37] Esther different ones bringing out
[45:39] things in the book of Jeremiah all of
[45:41] the things that through years been
[45:43] overlooked but have now to us in this
[45:45] day been magnified so we can see that
[45:48] God has a story in every character amen
[45:51] it's a purpose for every character and
[45:53] then uh saying and the prophet tell us
[45:56] if you look into the Bible and don't see
[45:58] Jesus Christ you miss something go back
[46:00] and read it again because it's a
[46:02] messageer there that God wants to give
[46:04] us amen so I believe that we are in the
[46:08] time of adoption and I know some have
[46:11] different uh views and different
[46:14] approaches that they approach certain
[46:15] things those things are fine with me and
[46:18] I can only go by the way God revealed
[46:20] things to me you know we don't try to
[46:22] impersonate someone else we just uh
[46:25] preach how God just revealed things to
[46:27] us and and we apply these things to our
[46:29] lives and uh but I love the scripture in
[46:33] Ephesian when it said having
[46:35] predestinated us into
[46:37] adoption that that that just uh a
[46:40] powerful scripture to me he
[46:42] predestinated us into adoption and that
[46:45] tells me uh it's not what I look at
[46:48] myself and how I think about myself and
[46:50] what God had predestinated me to be now
[46:54] there's many teachings as I said about
[46:57] adoption uh some try to make it seem
[46:59] like it's a hard subject but to me it's
[47:01] a very simple powerful subject that
[47:04] simply just tell me uh that God has a
[47:07] predestinated position for me that
[47:10] something that's going to be fulfilled
[47:11] in my life in this day and age and the
[47:15] prophet says that uh uh every individual
[47:18] have to seek God themselves that God can
[47:21] reveal to them their purpose in life hey
[47:24] can we say Amen praise the Lord uh Only
[47:27] God Can reveal that to an individual
[47:30] right praise the lord we as pastors and
[47:32] we preach the word of God and and we
[47:34] know that adoption is actually a
[47:36] believer's position in Christ can we say
[47:39] amen and God has to reveal that to a
[47:42] person so we're going to look into some
[47:45] scriptures and uh and some quotes and
[47:48] just kind of work with this subject
[47:49] because Ruth is one of my favorite books
[47:52] and I look at the Ruth a person that
[47:55] could come out of such such a seemingly
[47:58] terrible life but yet be put into a
[48:01] place and
[48:03] position when I look at Ruth is so
[48:05] encouraging to me to know you can come
[48:08] from the worst of worst situations in
[48:10] life amen but yet God can put you back
[48:13] on
[48:14] board that's what I look at when I look
[48:16] in the Book of Ruth can we say Amen how
[48:19] that even in the genology of Jesus
[48:21] Christ he used bad women named there
[48:24] seemingly Tamar Ruth and all the names
[48:27] can we say praise the Lord Rahab God put
[48:30] all those things in there to let us know
[48:32] you can come from the worst but I can
[48:34] take what was bad make it
[48:37] good can we say Amen I'm a living
[48:39] witness of that praise the Lord I I
[48:42] heard a brother one time tell me one
[48:43] time he said one struggles that I have
[48:45] in life he said as a kid I never really
[48:47] done nothing wrong he said I hear people
[48:50] testify what God them delivered them
[48:52] from and done for them and he said I
[48:54] have mind battles and I'm like he said
[48:56] like I I've been a good kid all my life
[48:58] and what did God deliver me from I said
[49:00] well I can help you with that he deliver
[49:01] you from
[49:03] sin praise the Lord he delivered you
[49:06] from sin that's the big thing right
[49:08] there amen and that's what mess up a lot
[49:10] of young people when they hear
[49:12] testimonies uh uh God delivered me from
[49:15] smoking God delivered me from
[49:17] pornography God delivered me from all
[49:18] these things and some sit there but I've
[49:21] been in the message and what what what
[49:24] what what what what have I done where he
[49:25] set me fee from and then they give a
[49:27] curiosity maybe I need to go fall and
[49:30] try something then I can have a
[49:31] testimony let me tell you something your
[49:33] testimony God kept
[49:36] you that should be your testimony he
[49:38] kept you from doing those things to me
[49:42] that is in a greater testimony because
[49:44] he's a he's a god he's a keeping God can
[49:47] we say amen and I think that's one of
[49:49] the most beautiful things that to me is
[49:51] such a compliment to this message that
[49:53] you can be born again filled with the
[49:55] Holy Spirit and you can have that
[49:57] testimony he kept me no I didn't do that
[50:00] but he kept me from doing that and
[50:02] that's giving God the glory amen but we
[50:04] come from different walks of life and we
[50:07] got each one have a different testimony
[50:09] of something that God has done in their
[50:11] life and and it all comes to the end we
[50:14] give God the glory because he deserves
[50:16] all the glory and the praise amen so
[50:19] when I see this uh predestinated us
[50:22] until adoption amen and I really love
[50:26] the scripture which we know in the book
[50:28] of galatian when it speaks of uh of
[50:31] adoption when Paul deals with that
[50:34] subject he began to speak and I'm just
[50:36] going to kind of maybe quote it if I
[50:38] could find it real quick in galatian
[50:40] when Paul just kind of laid the
[50:42] foundation on these things he said now I
[50:44] say that the heir as long as he is a
[50:46] child differs nothing from a servant
[50:49] though he be Lord of all I really love
[50:52] that scripture uh we know Paul they
[50:55] always going back to how that a father
[50:57] his heart's desire that you know they
[50:59] got a kingdom which would be a a a land
[51:02] that a father would have and he would
[51:04] have servants upon him and so forth but
[51:07] that father's greatest desire that one
[51:09] day everything that he has accomplished
[51:11] he can pass that over to that son can we
[51:14] say amen that's his greatest desire but
[51:17] the scripture tells us if though he said
[51:20] that the heir as long as he is a child
[51:22] different nothing from a servant though
[51:24] he be Lord of all so that boy is walking
[51:27] around one day knowing all of this is
[51:29] going to be
[51:30] mine but I can't get it when I want
[51:35] it praise the Lord he can walk around
[51:38] his father's property and say Yep this
[51:41] is mine this is mine I'mma be over this
[51:43] be over this but it's not his decision
[51:46] or his choice when he gets it
[51:48] amen right praise the Lord but he said
[51:52] he different nothing from a servant
[51:54] though he be Lord of all so far in the
[51:57] father M he's just a servant he ain't no
[52:00] different than them but he's my son but
[52:02] his condition where he's in life he just
[52:04] got a servant attitude he's not ready
[52:07] for this make no difference how much he
[52:09] thinks he ready he said I know the boy
[52:11] ain't
[52:12] ready it's the same thing God do you and
[52:15] me sometime we think we ready for
[52:16] something we think we deserve something
[52:19] we think we deserve a position no you
[52:21] can want and deserve it all you want to
[52:24] is when God wants to give it to you yes
[52:27] can we say praise the lord it's when he
[52:29] wants to give it to you so we see this
[52:31] he said but he's on the tutors and
[52:33] governors until the time here's the
[52:35] scripture to the time appointed not of
[52:38] the child to the time appointed of the
[52:40] father other words the child can say
[52:42] Daddy I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready
[52:44] ready daddy said no it's when I say
[52:46] you're
[52:47] ready praise the Lord he's on the tutor
[52:49] he's on the governor all these things
[52:52] which we know what they would do uh I I
[52:54] did a little study upon it back in them
[52:56] times what a father would do he would
[52:58] get one of his most trustworthy servants
[53:01] that been up the him for years and that
[53:04] servant he'll realize that servant my
[53:07] servant know what I like he knows what I
[53:09] don't like and he would take that
[53:11] servant and put his child under that
[53:14] servant a faithful servant so that
[53:17] servant when he's uh taking the child
[53:19] out and the child is walking around and
[53:21] and I I don't think that that boy when
[53:23] they was teaching him he was up under
[53:25] governments and tutors I don't I think
[53:26] it was based upon a bunch of books that
[53:28] he
[53:28] read I think it was experience that he
[53:31] went through as that servant take that
[53:33] son out amongst all of the people and
[53:36] then he watched how the boy react and
[53:38] amongst the people how he responds I
[53:40] think that servant be watching all of
[53:42] that that's right and then the father
[53:44] come to the servant how did my son do
[53:46] today he said he didn't do too good he
[53:48] said all right cuz that servant had to
[53:49] tell the truth that's right he got he
[53:51] can't say I really like this boy so let
[53:53] me cheat for him or do some shortcuts
[53:55] for him so I can pleased the father no
[53:57] the servant had to tell the Father the
[53:59] truth cuz what that father was looking
[54:02] forward to that when he come to that
[54:03] servant how is my son when that servant
[54:06] would say your son thinks like you acts
[54:10] like you handles situations just like
[54:13] you and the servant said by the way he
[54:14] reminds me of
[54:16] you and then the father say now it is
[54:20] the time that I can pass a position I
[54:24] can pass all of this Authority to my son
[54:27] so now I can present him before the
[54:29] people and say here is my son hear ye
[54:33] him he thinks like me he talks like me
[54:35] see that's the whole whole whole uh
[54:37] scope of adoption being about the
[54:40] father's business not our business being
[54:42] about the father's
[54:44] business can we say praise the Lord so
[54:47] uh but remember brothers and
[54:51] sisters if there's no
[54:53] birth there's no adoption
[54:58] can we say praise to the Lord many want
[55:01] positions and positions and positions
[55:03] but don't want a
[55:05] birth that tutor is the holy spirit can
[55:08] we say praise the Lord so it must be
[55:11] must be born again first but a lot of
[55:13] people want to be Authority and power
[55:16] and and ain't got no character fit what
[55:18] they trying to say that they have God
[55:20] wants
[55:22] character can we is that all right
[55:24] better R I'm just going to preach with
[55:25] on my heart look I just preach I don't
[55:27] come to preach to try to impress your
[55:29] pastor or try to impress you I want to I
[55:32] got one person I want to impress amen
[55:35] that's him the Lord Jesus Christ when he
[55:38] can say good job son that's what I'm
[55:41] interested in cuz we can't get up into
[55:43] all of these
[55:44] personalities can we say Amen it's all
[55:47] about us coming closer and closer to the
[55:49] Lord Jesus
[55:50] Christ praise God so we let's just look
[55:54] into some things and follow along with
[55:56] me I want to go to Deuteronomy chapter
[55:58] 23 and uh we're going to look at uh Ruth
[56:01] life and try to build up some things if
[56:04] the Lord would help
[56:08] us Deuteronomy chapter
[56:19] 23 in verse
[56:22] two it says a bastard should not enter
[56:24] into the congregation of the Lord Lord
[56:27] even to his 10th Generation shall he not
[56:31] enter into the congregation of the
[56:35] Lord and an
[56:37] ammonite or moabit shall not enter into
[56:40] the congregation of the Lord even to
[56:43] their 10th Generation shall they not
[56:46] enter into the congregation of the Lord
[56:50] forever that's a strong
[56:52] scripture and it speaks of two groups of
[56:55] people that ammonites and the moabites
[56:59] which we know that Ruth was a
[57:01] moabit so she already been marked and
[57:04] label that she can't enter into the
[57:06] congregation of the Lord even to the
[57:08] 10th
[57:09] Generation praise the Lord so 10
[57:12] generation had to pass by that for a
[57:14] moabit can even enter in are you with me
[57:18] so I find that very interesting but we
[57:20] talking about Ruth and we talking about
[57:23] predestination into adoption you know I
[57:26] go let me backtrack just a moment I love
[57:28] that word because when I look in my own
[57:31] life I know where my outcome is going to
[57:33] be and God going to make sure that I get
[57:36] there because I believe before the
[57:38] Rapture take place or either before God
[57:41] take a Believer life they are going to
[57:43] fulfill what he already predestinated in
[57:45] their life for it to be before that he
[57:48] takes them and it's not something that
[57:50] we're going to try to accomplish in
[57:51] ourself he knows when we get there but
[57:54] we strive to for Perfection that's what
[57:57] we do as an individual but Ruth is just
[58:00] the perfect person that could come out
[58:02] of a bad situation but look what she
[58:05] ended up being right in the lineage of
[58:08] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in this
[58:11] scripture right here which is a strong
[58:12] word but what I want to do I want to
[58:15] backtrack a little bit and try to run
[58:18] rof life down and then bring you and me
[58:20] on the scene because I'm thankful for
[58:22] the message of the hour cuz when we look
[58:24] at Ruth we should say me
[58:27] you should put yourself there what God
[58:29] done the Ruth we should say me cuz we
[58:31] are Ruth remember now that Ruth is a
[58:35] type of you and me but we are not a type
[58:39] of Ruth can we say Amen matter of fact
[58:42] the bride is not a type of nobody all of
[58:45] the other ones in the scripture types us
[58:47] but we type nobody we are the Bride of
[58:50] Jesus Christ but we can learn from all
[58:53] of these types what God had in mind
[58:55] about you and me praise the Lord now the
[58:59] scripture tells us that they can't enter
[59:01] into the congregation even until the
[59:03] 10th Generation but the scripture is so
[59:06] accurate how that every number
[59:09] everything in the Bible it has a meaning
[59:12] behind it sometimes we might not catch
[59:15] what the meaning is and the way I look
[59:17] at it if I don't catch what the meaning
[59:18] is of something it's simply because God
[59:20] don't want me to know it at the time
[59:23] because I know and got much confidence
[59:25] in him he
[59:26] every everything that I need at the time
[59:29] that I need it he'll make sure I get it
[59:32] amen that's why when somebody have a
[59:34] understanding on something I don't have
[59:36] an understanding that don't offend me
[59:39] because I know he's the only one can
[59:41] give me Revelation praise the Lord Flesh
[59:43] and Blood did not reveal these things
[59:45] unto you but my Father which is in
[59:47] heaven I said I know only he can give me
[59:49] Revelation and the thing that I know
[59:51] once he show it to me nobody can take it
[59:53] from me that's right Hallelujah can me
[59:55] say Amen man this message been revealed
[59:57] to me revealed it to me God revealed it
[1:00:00] to me that's why nobody can't talk me
[1:00:02] out of it nobody Tau me in it can't
[1:00:04] nobody talk me out of it amen praise the
[1:00:07] Lord I always tell my church when we
[1:00:08] witness when we testify we want to bring
[1:00:11] Jesus Christ on the scene don't try to
[1:00:13] talk somebody into coming to church
[1:00:15] that's right amen I said listen you talk
[1:00:18] somebody into the message with a
[1:00:19] hamburger somebody else will talk him
[1:00:21] out with a hot
[1:00:23] dog but if you can get them in and get a
[1:00:25] real relationship with Jesus Christ the
[1:00:28] same as way Paul took Timothy can we say
[1:00:31] Amen you remember Timothy what the
[1:00:33] brother B say look what Paul took
[1:00:35] Timothy he said that's what a True
[1:00:36] Believer will do when they get into them
[1:00:38] depths of God they'll go get another
[1:00:40] they'll go get another he'll referring
[1:00:42] to Billy Graham Billy Graham said I get
[1:00:44] three 30,000 Converse and came come back
[1:00:47] and find 30 he said what's the problem
[1:00:49] do the preacher sitting in there with
[1:00:51] the desk filled up on the de he said no
[1:00:53] my precious brother that's not it he
[1:00:54] said look what Paul Paul one and look
[1:00:56] what Paul through Timothy what Timothy
[1:00:58] began to do it's all about getting them
[1:01:00] to the Lord Jesus Christ that's the
[1:01:03] purpose can we say Amen cuz when you got
[1:01:05] that individual relationship with Jesus
[1:01:07] Christ if a group ain't with you you
[1:01:10] still serve God right if you by yourself
[1:01:13] you can serve God we're supposed to be
[1:01:15] Eagles can we say Amen Eagles don't fly
[1:01:18] in groots buzzers fly in groups buzzers
[1:01:21] depend on groups Eagles don't depend on
[1:01:24] groups when you see a eagle fly it'll be
[1:01:26] one or two he's by himself cuz he's
[1:01:29] still single amen or he don't got
[1:01:31] married he flying with his wife but they
[1:01:33] don't worry about groups so that should
[1:01:35] be the same with you and me this is a
[1:01:37] this is not a group effort you come to
[1:01:40] church to see Jesus Christ for yourself
[1:01:43] but if your your if your faith is built
[1:01:45] upon the church when the church fall
[1:01:47] you'll fall can we say Amen it's a
[1:01:50] individual
[1:01:52] race and that's the way that it has to
[1:01:54] be yes sir praise God but look at Ruth
[1:01:58] life you know there's no recorded
[1:02:01] scripture where you can actually some of
[1:02:04] you probably can but I couldn't find it
[1:02:06] well you can actually follow the
[1:02:09] generations how long Moab actually was
[1:02:13] because when you look at scripture and I
[1:02:14] want to point something out to you now
[1:02:17] we know brother Brandon said a
[1:02:18] generation heer to a generation as
[1:02:22] 40 right but that is not the case I know
[1:02:26] exactly what he meant but that is not
[1:02:28] the case of every generation in the
[1:02:31] Bible are you with me because sometime
[1:02:33] the Bible would say a
[1:02:36] generation plural then a generation
[1:02:39] singular so when you look in scripture
[1:02:42] you find Generations sometimes deal with
[1:02:45] ancestral generation or lineal
[1:02:49] generation now when he was speaking of
[1:02:51] 40 which is a generation he's speaking
[1:02:53] of a age that we are 40 is a generation
[1:02:57] are you with me so far this is not
[1:02:59] nothing contradictory what he said but
[1:03:01] I'm saying this for a purpose to show
[1:03:03] you even when you're dealing with
[1:03:04] Generations in the Scriptures it depend
[1:03:06] on what thought that you are bringing
[1:03:08] you have to line them things up are you
[1:03:11] with me cuz sometimes just using 40 toy
[1:03:14] to figure out a generation it don't work
[1:03:16] out mathematically many of times are you
[1:03:19] with me so now when we try to follow the
[1:03:23] generation of Ruth when would that 10th
[1:03:26] Generation was up I find one of the best
[1:03:29] Clues to go back to see where that was
[1:03:33] it's actually used the generation of
[1:03:37] Isaac because Isaac and Moab Moab kind
[1:03:40] of came on the scene at the same time
[1:03:43] are you with me you remember when Sodom
[1:03:45] and Gomorrah when it was burned that's
[1:03:47] when the lot daughters a man had a
[1:03:50] relationship with him right and it
[1:03:52] wasn't much after that that's when Isaac
[1:03:54] come on the scene so if we can follow
[1:03:57] Isaac genealogy his timing it'll give us
[1:04:00] a good idea with the generations of Ruth
[1:04:03] are we clear so far amen so now let's
[1:04:07] just go to this Genesis 19 verse 29 if
[1:04:10] you
[1:04:12] will Genesis
[1:04:14] 19:29 it said and it came to pass when
[1:04:18] God destroyed the cities of the plain
[1:04:20] that God remembered Abraham and sent lot
[1:04:23] out of the midst of the overthrow when
[1:04:26] he overthrew the cities in which lot
[1:04:29] dwelt how many you believe you're the
[1:04:30] children of Abraham Sons and Daughters
[1:04:33] of Abraham God is expressing something
[1:04:36] even right here in the scripture how
[1:04:37] important that it is he didn't the Bible
[1:04:40] didn't say amen he remember lot he
[1:04:42] remembered Abraham what did he remember
[1:04:45] about Abraham the prayer that Abraham
[1:04:47] made for lot the intercession that
[1:04:49] Abraham was doing for lot so that takes
[1:04:52] me back to what the prophet said that
[1:04:53] the very same faith that you have for
[1:04:56] your salvation you can apply that to
[1:04:58] your family can we say amen that's
[1:05:01] powerful to me now they might even get
[1:05:03] worse children might get worse might go
[1:05:05] farther away loved one got go farther
[1:05:08] away it ain't what I'm looking at it's a
[1:05:10] promise that God gave me that I just
[1:05:12] keep them up in prayer and trusting God
[1:05:14] to deal with them cuz sometime because
[1:05:17] they going farther away that don't mean
[1:05:19] it's
[1:05:20] worse praise the Lord I like that so he
[1:05:24] said in God remember Abraham and sent
[1:05:27] lot out of the midst of the overthrow
[1:05:29] when he overthrew the cities in which
[1:05:31] lot dwelt lot went out of zoah and dwelt
[1:05:35] in the mountain and his two daughters
[1:05:37] with him for he feared to dwell in zah
[1:05:40] he dwelt in a cave he and his two
[1:05:43] daughters and the firstborn said unto
[1:05:46] the younger our father is old and there
[1:05:49] is not a man in the earth to come into
[1:05:51] us after the manner of all Earth he come
[1:05:55] let us make our father drink wine and we
[1:05:57] will lie with him that we may preserve
[1:06:00] seed of our father now this is me now I
[1:06:03] G this is where I see these things now
[1:06:06] there's many I know I hear a lot of
[1:06:09] preaching when they speak of the
[1:06:10] situation with lot and what happened
[1:06:13] here with his daughters some people
[1:06:15] that's got many things that they throw
[1:06:16] out they say look how abomino those
[1:06:19] girls was look how filthy this situation
[1:06:22] was look what they're doing they says
[1:06:24] they I hear some say they doing this
[1:06:26] because they've been down in Sodom so
[1:06:27] long and the spirit of Sodom fell upon
[1:06:30] them here are all sorts of things but if
[1:06:33] you look at in the scripture they was
[1:06:35] not doing this for
[1:06:40] filthiness they said preserve
[1:06:43] seed it wasn't something that they said
[1:06:45] well I want to just have a great uh
[1:06:47] relationship and do something that
[1:06:49] wasn't what the purpose was if we can
[1:06:51] look at Tamar life and seeing what she
[1:06:53] done was actually righteous why can't we
[1:06:55] even look in the scripture and see what
[1:06:56] was in their
[1:06:58] heart but yet we know in the sight of
[1:07:01] God it was an abominal thing because it
[1:07:03] deals with daughter and father so in the
[1:07:07] sight of God that's why he made that
[1:07:08] statement even to the T generation but
[1:07:12] yet on their part it was not for just
[1:07:14] sexual
[1:07:17] pleasure praise the Lord cuz here is
[1:07:20] where Ruth come from right here from
[1:07:23] this situation
[1:07:28] praise the Lord can we keep
[1:07:31] going notice verse 33 they made their
[1:07:35] father drink wine that night and the
[1:07:37] firstborn went in and lay with her
[1:07:38] father and he perceived not when she
[1:07:40] laid down nor when she arose verse 34
[1:07:45] and it came to pass on the marrow that
[1:07:46] the firstborn said unto the younger
[1:07:48] behold I lay yester night with my father
[1:07:51] let us make him drink wine this night
[1:07:53] also and thou and go thou in and lie
[1:07:56] with him just that we may preserve seed
[1:08:01] of our
[1:08:03] father and this is where the nation of
[1:08:06] Moab and the ammonite was actually
[1:08:08] birthed praise the Lord but God was
[1:08:11] looking at something even greater than
[1:08:13] this and we're going to try to go and
[1:08:15] bounce through the scriptures a little
[1:08:16] bit then if you go to Genesis 21 we know
[1:08:20] this is after uh Solomon and gomorah was
[1:08:22] destroyed Genesis 21 verse one said and
[1:08:26] the Lord visited Sarah as he had said
[1:08:29] and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had
[1:08:32] spoken for Sarah conceived bear Abraham
[1:08:36] a son in his old age at the set time in
[1:08:39] which God had spoken to him and Abraham
[1:08:42] called the name of his son that was born
[1:08:44] unto him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac so
[1:08:48] from Genesis 21 from Genesis 19 we uh we
[1:08:52] see that there's a we can get a close
[1:08:55] idea deal of the time Moab was born and
[1:08:58] when Isaac was born so if we can see the
[1:09:01] generation even of Isaac we'll have some
[1:09:03] kind of idea how Ruth her time came up
[1:09:07] now for her to come into the body of
[1:09:09] Christ I would say the body of Christ I
[1:09:11] know it say the house of God but I'm
[1:09:13] just saying into a position yet she come
[1:09:15] out of such a perverted thing from idol
[1:09:18] worship offering up babies and all this
[1:09:20] kind of thing and it was
[1:09:23] terrible but they not that that's wasn't
[1:09:25] what God was looking at he knew what her
[1:09:28] end would be praise the Lord I'm glad
[1:09:31] God look at it like that cuz some people
[1:09:33] I deal with they just
[1:09:35] terrible they are just terrible you like
[1:09:38] my God but then you think about yourself
[1:09:40] look what he did for you look what he
[1:09:42] brought you from that gives you Grace to
[1:09:44] deal with people and let them know that
[1:09:46] there is hope I don't care how you was
[1:09:48] born how you was raised what you went
[1:09:50] through but there is a God that can
[1:09:52] change every bit of that the very moment
[1:09:54] you give your heart to us
[1:09:55] that's praise the
[1:09:57] Lord amen so now we got Ruth we want to
[1:10:00] try to pray her on the scene for a
[1:10:03] moment now if you will turn with me to
[1:10:05] Matthew chapter
[1:10:19] 1 praise the
[1:10:21] Lorden there is an appointed time
[1:10:25] sir for each one of us thank you Lord
[1:10:28] and it's in God's
[1:10:30] timing praise God that's why I said Lord
[1:10:32] I I might not be where I want to be but
[1:10:34] I know one thing I'm going to get
[1:10:36] there cuz I believe I'm your son I'm
[1:10:39] your child and you promise you going to
[1:10:40] get me there I ain't going to get myself
[1:10:42] there you going to get me there praise
[1:10:45] the
[1:10:46] Lord Matthew chapter
[1:10:49] 1 I want you to notice now it said
[1:10:51] Abraham begat
[1:10:54] Isaac now let just kind of follow along
[1:10:56] with him for time sake I know I ain't
[1:10:58] GNA get finished but we're gonna try to
[1:10:59] get as much as we can in Abraham begat
[1:11:03] Isaac and Isaac begat who Jacob so after
[1:11:07] Isaac there's a generation we're going
[1:11:09] to see in verse it said no let me back
[1:11:13] up let's go to Matthew chapter 1 verse
[1:11:16] one if you notice it says here the book
[1:11:20] of the generation of Jesus
[1:11:23] Christ singular amen yes it didn't say
[1:11:27] plural it didn't say Generations now
[1:11:30] it's saying the book of the generation
[1:11:33] of Jesus
[1:11:35] Christ the son of David the son of
[1:11:40] Abraham now watch Abraham begat Isaac
[1:11:44] and Isaac begat who Jacob one generation
[1:11:49] Jacob begat Judas too and his Brethren
[1:11:53] Judas begat parz three and four and and
[1:11:57] and and Perez and zarra and Tamar four
[1:12:01] and Perez begat Isham five ishran begat
[1:12:05] Aaron six Aon begat ainad seven and Amad
[1:12:10] begat Nan eight Nan begat Solomon nine
[1:12:15] and Solomon got who Boaz
[1:12:22] 10 10 now we see Ruth come on the on the
[1:12:27] scene with boas right so now we see
[1:12:32] something had to happen now it was
[1:12:34] nothing in the time of Boaz there's
[1:12:36] nothing going to hold Ruth back now for
[1:12:38] getting to Boaz cuz in God uh the time
[1:12:42] is
[1:12:43] up amen praise the Lord all holes now
[1:12:47] been let loose but yet now God got to
[1:12:50] take Ruth to a process to get her where
[1:12:53] he need her to get to are you with me
[1:12:56] now let's turn to Ruth chapter
[1:13:02] one we're going to look at the beginning
[1:13:04] of Ruth personal journey and we're going
[1:13:07] to just follow it as the prophet brought
[1:13:09] us to the message kisman
[1:13:13] Redeemer
[1:13:15] amen let's backtrack a little moment now
[1:13:19] we know that when
[1:13:21] Israel when they rejected their Messiah
[1:13:25] we know according to the scripture that
[1:13:27] they had to reject him and by their
[1:13:31] rejection of him it brought salvation to
[1:13:33] us the Gentiles amen it been explained
[1:13:37] even through Jacob when he blessed uh J
[1:13:40] Joseph's son you remember he crossed his
[1:13:42] hand that they're showing us that the
[1:13:44] blessing going to come at the cross
[1:13:46] Israel being the older we being the
[1:13:48] younger but at the cross is going to
[1:13:50] bring Salvation to the Gentiles can we
[1:13:53] say praise the Lord and then we see all
[1:13:55] down through the scripture how these
[1:13:57] things have to be how that even Joseph
[1:14:00] had to be rejected Joseph had to be
[1:14:02] rejected for the purpose to go down into
[1:14:05] Egypt to get a gentile wife we see all
[1:14:07] of these patterns how the prophet told
[1:14:09] us all these things are just perfect now
[1:14:12] when Joseph was rejected it caused him
[1:14:14] to go down to Egypt to get him a gentile
[1:14:17] wife so when Christ was rejected by the
[1:14:19] Jews it now caused salvation to come to
[1:14:22] you and me is that right even Paul when
[1:14:25] he came on the scene he tried to go back
[1:14:27] to the Jews when they rejected he said
[1:14:29] it was needful for you to do this CU now
[1:14:31] L we go to the Gentile because that's
[1:14:33] God's pattern then we find Amen in
[1:14:37] Romans chapter 11 Paul said I don't want
[1:14:39] you to be ignorant of this thing that
[1:14:41] blindness in part has happened to Israel
[1:14:44] until the fullness of the Gentile come
[1:14:46] in are we with me so all of these things
[1:14:49] had to happen and God showing all these
[1:14:51] patterns and we're able to go back
[1:14:53] that's why as Gentiles we ought to be
[1:14:55] thankful because we know that the gospel
[1:14:58] can't go back to Israel until God is
[1:15:00] finished with us now look what Israel is
[1:15:02] doing now look what they're going
[1:15:04] through it's showing us how close we are
[1:15:06] to be getting up out of here but until
[1:15:08] the forness of the Gentile come in God
[1:15:11] can't deal with the Jews the way that he
[1:15:13] wants to deal with them so what is God
[1:15:15] waiting on now he waiting on this bride
[1:15:17] he waiting on you and me to get in order
[1:15:19] so the Rapture can take
[1:15:23] place so we see all of these patterns
[1:15:26] amen how had to be a
[1:15:29] rejection then we see the pattern amen
[1:15:33] when uh when the the prophet begin to
[1:15:37] bring in World War I World War II World
[1:15:41] War I there's never been a message like
[1:15:43] this to bring these things to our day to
[1:15:46] show you it was just not just Wars just
[1:15:49] to be a war but it's the tender hand of
[1:15:53] Jehovah amen praise the Lord I went over
[1:15:57] there and uh when all the war and stuff
[1:15:59] taking place in Ukraine I went over to
[1:16:01] Ria to share the gospel with some with a
[1:16:03] church they asked me to come a lot of
[1:16:05] ukrainians escaped and went to Ria I
[1:16:08] tell you when I went to the pull pit you
[1:16:10] you you you you you you feel all that
[1:16:13] pressure you just like what what can you
[1:16:15] say what can you do they don't escape to
[1:16:17] find Refuge there don't never know when
[1:16:19] they going to go back home they don't
[1:16:21] know I'm sitting at the pull pck hey how
[1:16:23] y'all doing but pressure
[1:16:26] pressure the only when something come to
[1:16:28] my mind I said I want to say one thing
[1:16:30] to
[1:16:32] you I said in the time of
[1:16:35] Hitler or what happened now could you
[1:16:37] imagine mentioning that to him and them
[1:16:38] and they already in
[1:16:40] pressure but I had to cuz that's what
[1:16:43] fell in my heart I said we have to
[1:16:44] remember in that time even when World
[1:16:47] War I and World War II and all these
[1:16:50] things I said a news reporter I said if
[1:16:53] a news reporter would have said this is
[1:16:56] the tender hand of Jehovah it wouldn't
[1:16:58] have meant nothing I said it took a
[1:17:01] prophet to go and say this is the tender
[1:17:04] hand of Jehovah and I said I want to
[1:17:07] tell y'all something I painful
[1:17:10] everything that y'all are going through
[1:17:12] this is still the tender hand of
[1:17:15] Jehovah and when I make those statement
[1:17:17] you can feel the pressure just leave to
[1:17:19] let them realize God is still in control
[1:17:22] a lot of things we don't understand but
[1:17:24] God is still in
[1:17:27] control cuz it's the tender hand of
[1:17:30] Jehovah amen and remember I I'll read
[1:17:34] the quote for you in a moment when he
[1:17:36] begin to bring things out in the message
[1:17:38] kid of Redeemer it's a beautiful picture
[1:17:41] after they rejected the Messiah we know
[1:17:43] then it brought them forth up to Luke 21
[1:17:45] I believe it is when Jesus gave them a
[1:17:47] prophecy let them know don't go back and
[1:17:49] when you see Jerusalem is surrounded
[1:17:52] don't go back and get your stuff stay
[1:17:54] away
[1:17:55] amen he know that was a prophecy that
[1:17:58] Titus was going to come in ad70 he gave
[1:18:01] them that prophecy and the prophet said
[1:18:03] there was not one believer cing to that
[1:18:06] because they remember what Jesus
[1:18:09] said amen so we see after that the Bible
[1:18:13] tells us then they were scattered
[1:18:16] through all out of the world right but
[1:18:19] we know under the Feast of the trumpets
[1:18:22] recognizing your day in this message how
[1:18:24] the thing was taught to us how God had
[1:18:27] to get them to go back to Jerusalem so
[1:18:29] that he could deal with them he did it
[1:18:31] through the war war one World War I
[1:18:34] World War Two now what Theologian going
[1:18:36] to tie wo them three woes in the Book of
[1:18:39] Revelation to
[1:18:40] war you ain't going to find one God
[1:18:44] brought it to us
[1:18:46] today are you with me notice when they
[1:18:49] rejected Jesus that caused all of the
[1:18:51] problems when they said let his blood be
[1:18:54] upon us us and our children they spoke
[1:18:57] that but I'm so thankful Paul let us
[1:19:00] know in the Book of Romans he said
[1:19:03] Israel has not got what she looking for
[1:19:06] he said but the election has obtained
[1:19:09] that for her that go to show you that
[1:19:12] God have not forgot about them amen
[1:19:14] which is that 144,000 election done T
[1:19:18] that for her she's going to get what
[1:19:19] she's looking for God made sure he
[1:19:22] sealed it that where I will take care
[1:19:24] that
[1:19:26] 144,000 it's been sealed you and I
[1:19:28] peeping in the future amen what God is
[1:19:31] going to do we know exactly what he's
[1:19:32] going to do we thank God for that but
[1:19:35] why are we at right
[1:19:37] now and you remember how brother Brandon
[1:19:39] brought all these things out with the
[1:19:41] trumpets and so forth he's telling us no
[1:19:43] the trumpets is for the Jews the seals
[1:19:45] is for the
[1:19:46] Gentiles amen we look in the story of
[1:19:49] Joseph again when his brothers sold him
[1:19:52] out what did Joseph do go to Egypt get a
[1:19:55] gentile wife right but did God forget
[1:19:58] Joseph's brothers no they were just a
[1:20:01] part of the plan Amen to get Joseph to
[1:20:04] be sold into Egypt see that's when God
[1:20:07] positions Us in places that he wants us
[1:20:10] to be in sometimes it's painful you go
[1:20:12] through a lot of pain you go through a
[1:20:14] lot of hurt but God is behind that to
[1:20:17] put you into a place where he want to
[1:20:19] put you in when God was dealing with
[1:20:22] Joseph Joseph's brothers was was not on
[1:20:25] God's
[1:20:26] mind God mind was on
[1:20:29] Joseph he just used them as a tool to
[1:20:32] get Joseph where he need to get Joseph
[1:20:35] that's right are you with me when they
[1:20:37] sold Joseph what did he do he go into
[1:20:40] Egypt he get him a gentile wife we know
[1:20:43] that's a type when the Jews sold out the
[1:20:46] Lord Jesus Christ now he comes to get a
[1:20:48] gentile
[1:20:49] bride are you with me then we see in
[1:20:52] tight how that when Joseph everything
[1:20:55] that he went through we know the two
[1:20:56] thieves on the cross typ the the Baker
[1:20:59] and the butler down in uh in the dungeon
[1:21:01] with Joseph how Joseph was written up to
[1:21:03] his place of adoption and so forth by
[1:21:05] your need to Joseph we know that story
[1:21:08] yeah praise the Lord you know I tell you
[1:21:12] something friends when God puts you in a
[1:21:15] place but you can't get over hurt right
[1:21:18] and you keep living a life I can't
[1:21:20] believe people D me like this I can't
[1:21:22] believe I can't believe you ain't going
[1:21:24] to go no farther than that because
[1:21:25] that's what you
[1:21:28] believe you ain't going to go no further
[1:21:30] than that because Joseph you got to look
[1:21:33] at if there ever was a man had a right
[1:21:37] to pay his brothers back for what they
[1:21:39] done to him it was
[1:21:42] Joseph can we say Amen but look what God
[1:21:45] done to Joseph we look at Joseph when he
[1:21:47] comes up out of the Tomb I mean come up
[1:21:49] out of the dungeon sitting on the right
[1:21:51] hand of pharaoh we said why he's blessed
[1:21:53] but that was not Joseph's final test
[1:21:57] Joseph final test was now he got all
[1:22:00] power in his hands he got all of it in
[1:22:03] his hand all he had to do is tell them
[1:22:05] wipe something out they would have done
[1:22:06] it his final test when his brother sat
[1:22:09] right in front of him he got that power
[1:22:11] to tell them Egyptian wipe these guys
[1:22:13] out I don't want to see them they would
[1:22:14] have done it without a question but what
[1:22:17] Joseph final test was when he looking at
[1:22:19] his brothers when he realized you did
[1:22:21] not send me down here he said God s me
[1:22:24] down here you didn't do it God put me
[1:22:26] into this
[1:22:27] place that's why in our life we get to a
[1:22:30] place in our life it ain't what people
[1:22:32] done to me it ain't what people said
[1:22:34] about me just is God God Ming my
[1:22:37] character God allowed me to go through
[1:22:39] these things cuz he's working on
[1:22:42] me so you'll go no further than what you
[1:22:46] believe he was
[1:22:48] molding character in Joseph for power
[1:22:55] am think about the woman that told that
[1:22:57] lie on
[1:22:59] him if she was still
[1:23:02] alive husband come
[1:23:04] home you remember that man you told that
[1:23:07] lie
[1:23:08] on and he got put in jail she said yes I
[1:23:13] said now he said now he's on the right
[1:23:14] hand of
[1:23:19] pharaoh and here come Joseph bow the
[1:23:22] knee here come Joseph I see Joseph up on
[1:23:24] the Chariot and then she standing on us
[1:23:28] cuz she had to give respect to him
[1:23:30] too now she's out there and then Joseph
[1:23:33] looked at her
[1:23:35] she come
[1:23:38] on Joseph just say all is
[1:23:41] well cuz God was working on
[1:23:48] mejah praise the Lord God used people he
[1:23:52] used incident he even used used
[1:23:54] tragedies he used whatever he had to do
[1:23:57] to get to that believer so he can get
[1:23:59] them to the place that he wants
[1:24:04] them and God is so beautiful when he get
[1:24:07] a Believer to a place that he wants them
[1:24:09] to be then he can send them back to help
[1:24:11] the people that cause him problems amen
[1:24:14] that's right brother when God gets you
[1:24:16] where he wants you then he sends you
[1:24:18] back to the ones that cause you
[1:24:20] problems he done the same thing to
[1:24:22] Abraham lot called Abraham
[1:24:24] problems but when God got Abraham what
[1:24:27] he wanted him he sent him back to Rescue
[1:24:33] lot praise the Lord that's why he works
[1:24:36] on us first so he can use us the way
[1:24:39] that he want us to use us to be written
[1:24:41] Epistles to be ambassadors of Jesus
[1:24:43] Christ he got to deal with us
[1:24:48] first so we see all of these beautiful
[1:24:51] types the Jews Joseph Brothers they
[1:24:54] didn't realize it were the trumpets
[1:24:56] blowing on their life to bring them to
[1:24:59] Joseph same thing today the trumpets
[1:25:02] blowing on the Jews to bring them to
[1:25:04] meet Jesus Christ you remember the
[1:25:05] prophet talked about when they was
[1:25:07] getting on that plane they said what are
[1:25:08] you doing you going back to Jerusalem to
[1:25:10] die they said no we're going back to
[1:25:12] meet our
[1:25:14] Messiah they realize it's a move of God
[1:25:17] taking us back and that's what they're
[1:25:20] waiting on that 144,000 sometime people
[1:25:24] actually question now that 144,000 that
[1:25:27] Moses and Elijah is going to preach to
[1:25:30] uh you say going to be the Jews that's
[1:25:32] why they went back home yeah that's
[1:25:33] correct they said but look how old the
[1:25:36] people don't die nothing from out of the
[1:25:37] Holocaust how you going to tell me
[1:25:39] that's still 144,000 there I said
[1:25:41] friends be for real when they went back
[1:25:45] to Jerusalem the seed was in the men
[1:25:48] they got children they got something for
[1:25:49] God to come back and get I said god is
[1:25:51] perfect in the plan
[1:25:54] can we say Amen it's the same thing he
[1:25:56] told Jeremiah when they went down in
[1:25:58] Babylon what did God do sent them a
[1:26:01] letter why they would Lord have mercy
[1:26:03] God sued them a ladder while they was in
[1:26:06] Babylon before they went to Babylon they
[1:26:09] would listen to The Prophet but when
[1:26:11] they got in Babylon God still sent them
[1:26:13] a message he told Jeremiah to write I
[1:26:16] can't remember the brother name Jeremiah
[1:26:18] gave him a letter and Jeremiah said take
[1:26:20] this to and read it to them while
[1:26:22] they're in Babylon
[1:26:25] could you just imagine that brothers and
[1:26:27] sisters while they was in Babylon they
[1:26:30] didn't listen to The Prophet but now
[1:26:33] they send the letter to
[1:26:35] Babylon I can see some of them getting
[1:26:37] excited right oh Jeremiah wrot us a
[1:26:40] letter well listen now what what he say
[1:26:43] what he say what he say what he say oh
[1:26:45] this going to be encouraging tell us
[1:26:46] what Jeremiah said now I can guarantee
[1:26:48] to say see what it is God don't gave
[1:26:50] Jeremiah another revelation we ain't
[1:26:52] going to be down here too long so now
[1:26:54] Jeremiah going to let us know we going
[1:26:55] we going to get up out of here now hey
[1:26:57] man oh brother read it to us read it to
[1:26:59] us then he gets up there and
[1:27:05] say let your son marry
[1:27:08] daughters your daughter married Sons
[1:27:12] plant Vineyards build houses they're
[1:27:16] like
[1:27:18] huh on I'm in Babylon you're going to
[1:27:20] tell me to let my children get married
[1:27:22] plant Gardens and so forth like
[1:27:24] that yeah God didn't change his mind
[1:27:27] they wanted an encouraging letter that
[1:27:29] was the encouraging letter that I want
[1:27:31] you to still continue on yeah you you
[1:27:33] messed up but I'm not going to change my
[1:27:35] mind but God realized cuz they were so
[1:27:38] depressed they didn't even want to have
[1:27:40] family
[1:27:41] relations and God knew if they don't
[1:27:43] have family relation I ain't going to
[1:27:45] have nobody after these 70 years to come
[1:27:48] get so God said keep having children
[1:27:51] plant Vineyards then he said pray for
[1:27:54] the ones that got you in
[1:27:57] captivity that ain't no encouragement
[1:28:00] letter but it was what God want to give
[1:28:02] them that time cuz they their it was
[1:28:04] their fault they was there but God said
[1:28:07] my thoughts of you they are not evil
[1:28:09] they are good he said but I have an
[1:28:12] expected end for you amen that you will
[1:28:15] go back to
[1:28:16] Jerusalem that's the way God thinks
[1:28:18] about us not evil is good even though we
[1:28:21] go through hard time his thinking about
[1:28:23] us is good where did it start good
[1:28:25] before the foundation of the world in
[1:28:27] his mind he know exactly what everyone
[1:28:29] of us going to
[1:28:33] be praise the Lord he just got ways of
[1:28:37] doing
[1:28:40] things all of these types everything
[1:28:43] just lines up so
[1:28:45] beautifully everything will find its
[1:28:48] place just the way God seen it before
[1:28:51] the foundation of the world is going to
[1:28:53] fall into his slot you're going to fall
[1:28:55] in his place that's why as a minister I
[1:28:58] ain't got to do nothing manipulant to
[1:29:00] try to get it in the door to preach for
[1:29:03] somebody or be a buddy to try to get in
[1:29:05] somebody preach I don't have to do none
[1:29:06] of that because I know wherever God has
[1:29:09] ordained for me to minister that door
[1:29:11] going to open itself it's nothing that I
[1:29:13] have to do because the gifts make room
[1:29:16] for
[1:29:17] themselves so whenever you see somebody
[1:29:19] trying to manipulate or turn something
[1:29:21] so they can get it to a place they can
[1:29:22] get it to a position you that person
[1:29:24] don't have a revelation they're trying
[1:29:26] to do it and then the Prophet come right
[1:29:28] back he said the one that wants to do it
[1:29:31] so bad is not the one that God
[1:29:34] called didn't he say
[1:29:39] it praise the
[1:29:41] Lord now
[1:29:43] Ruth comes on the
[1:29:46] scene the Bible say Ru Ruth chapter 1
[1:29:49] verse
[1:29:51] one I'm trying to I'm going try my best
[1:29:55] to try to wind it
[1:29:57] down Ruth chapter 1 verse
[1:30:01] one now it came to pass in the days when
[1:30:04] the judges
[1:30:05] rulle that there was a famine in the
[1:30:08] land and a certain man of Bethlehem
[1:30:11] Judea went to serjin in the country of
[1:30:13] Moab he and his wife and his two
[1:30:18] sons and the name of the man was IMC and
[1:30:21] the name of his wife Na armi and the
[1:30:23] name of his two sons Mah chilion of epes
[1:30:27] Bethlehem Judea and they came into the
[1:30:30] country of Moab and continued there do
[1:30:33] you
[1:30:34] realize when that famine took place in
[1:30:36] the land when Naomi and her husband left
[1:30:40] Bethlehem Judea that is a type of them
[1:30:43] rejecting the Jews rejected Christ cuz
[1:30:47] when they rejected Christ it caused them
[1:30:49] to be scattered out into the land so
[1:30:52] that Grace can come to the Gen house so
[1:30:55] what's happening right here in the Book
[1:30:56] of Ruth this is kind of the same type
[1:30:59] what Naomi them and EM is doing they see
[1:31:02] that there's a little famine going on
[1:31:04] they said we we need to let's just B
[1:31:07] what did they do they scatter out to
[1:31:09] Moab but what they didn't
[1:31:12] realize their rejection was bringing
[1:31:15] salvation to Ruth got the 10 generation
[1:31:19] was
[1:31:21] up amen they in realiz they were walking
[1:31:25] right in the plan of God cuz God said I
[1:31:27] got Ruth on my mind I need to get Ruth
[1:31:30] where I need to get her and I need to do
[1:31:32] some moving
[1:31:33] around and then all of a sudden Livin
[1:31:35] that got a revelation we need to move no
[1:31:39] God was behind all of
[1:31:42] that
[1:31:45] lord it's the same pattern and then all
[1:31:48] of a sudden they get down into
[1:31:50] Moab when they get down there
[1:31:54] verse three in a lmon n Naomi's husband
[1:31:57] died she was left and her two
[1:32:00] sons they took them wives of the women
[1:32:03] of Moab the name of the one was Oprah
[1:32:06] and the name of the other Ruth they
[1:32:08] dwell there about 10 years and Malon and
[1:32:13] chilion died also both of them and the
[1:32:16] woman was left of her two sons in her
[1:32:19] husband you notice when when when when
[1:32:22] uh when Naomi husband died she wasn't
[1:32:26] thinking about going
[1:32:28] back but when her sons died and she
[1:32:31] heard that God is visiting them giving
[1:32:33] them bread now she wants to go back can
[1:32:37] we say Amen what was happening here in
[1:32:39] Naomi's life is God blowing the Trumpets
[1:32:42] on her life the same that he done the
[1:32:45] Jews amen when our husband died that was
[1:32:49] her first woe right when her sons died
[1:32:52] that was her second woe the same as
[1:32:54] World War I the Jews weren thinking
[1:32:57] about going back but World War II they
[1:32:59] went back so now Naomi with her sons
[1:33:02] died which was her second W she said now
[1:33:04] it's time for me to go back home it's
[1:33:07] the exact same
[1:33:15] pattern because God was blowing the
[1:33:20] Trumpets on na Army
[1:33:24] but what was he doing the Ruth F to open
[1:33:26] the
[1:33:29] seals can we say Amen what is the seven
[1:33:32] seal the coming of the Lord who Ruth
[1:33:34] going to meet Boaz the lord of the
[1:33:37] Harvest so now they're walking they're
[1:33:41] moving together one under the seals one
[1:33:43] under the
[1:33:44] trumpets amen then the prophet comes on
[1:33:47] the scene what did he say he said the
[1:33:51] very time that when Israel was con
[1:33:53] consider a nation he said that was the
[1:33:55] same time the angel visit me to give me
[1:33:58] a commission what is he doing now
[1:34:00] placing Ruth and Naomi walking together
[1:34:03] he begin to preach Israel and the church
[1:34:06] amen begin to line everything back up to
[1:34:09] show you and me where we are
[1:34:15] [Applause]
[1:34:17] at but
[1:34:21] Ruth she could not start her journey she
[1:34:26] was placed in
[1:34:28] Israel but before she can get
[1:34:31] placed her first husband had to
[1:34:40] die God not an
[1:34:43] adulterer he know Ruth married the wrong
[1:34:47] one cuz the one that she married could
[1:34:50] not bring her back in the status of life
[1:34:53] he was backslid himself that's why you
[1:34:55] see R and Ruth had no
[1:35:01] children God kept that wound shut up cuz
[1:35:05] he knew Ruth need Royal
[1:35:07] seed Ruth need someone that can plant
[1:35:10] seed to bring
[1:35:12] restoration that's why our denomination
[1:35:14] of Life got to
[1:35:16] die can we say man denomination can't
[1:35:19] have Christ being formed in you but this
[1:35:21] message com but Christ can be formed in
[1:35:23] you
[1:35:24] yes
[1:35:25] sir so Ruth first husband had to die
[1:35:29] that's why you and I before we can start
[1:35:31] this journey this first man this old
[1:35:34] nature got to
[1:35:36] [Applause]
[1:35:37] die sir then after he
[1:35:43] died and the prophet begin to go into
[1:35:45] the phases Ruth
[1:35:48] deciding Ruth serving Ruth resting Ruth
[1:35:53] rewarding
[1:35:54] it he begin to bring it into a
[1:35:57] cycle that same pattern for you and
[1:36:00] me when we first start serving the lord
[1:36:03] we got to be willing see God crucify
[1:36:06] this old man this old nature just me I
[1:36:10] need to be crucified before I can even
[1:36:12] start I have to make the right final
[1:36:15] clear-cut decision just the same as Ruth
[1:36:17] did if you ain't got the Holy Spirit
[1:36:19] today it's simply I'm going be honest
[1:36:21] with you cuz you ain't made a clear-cut
[1:36:27] decision the prophet says this if you
[1:36:29] ain't got the Holy Ghost he said the
[1:36:31] reason why God has not honored your
[1:36:33] faith God has not seen your faith that's
[1:36:35] why he have not given you the Holy
[1:36:39] Ghost it so people going year after year
[1:36:42] I want the Holy Ghost I want the Holy
[1:36:44] Ghost I want the Holy Ghost let me tell
[1:36:45] you something friends when you are
[1:36:47] really yeah when you are really ready to
[1:36:51] die from yourself you can get the Holy
[1:36:55] Ghost yes sir but long as you still want
[1:36:58] part of you to live you ain't gonna get
[1:36:59] born
[1:37:05] again so
[1:37:09] Ruth you see when you start wanting to
[1:37:12] serve the
[1:37:13] Lord It's not the devil ain't going to
[1:37:16] make it easy on you that's right that's
[1:37:19] when pressure actually
[1:37:21] comes because he want to stop you from
[1:37:23] from being
[1:37:24] sealed pressure just comes everywhere so
[1:37:27] we see Ruth let me skip some of
[1:37:33] this let me read this quote then I'll
[1:37:35] jump it back in the prophet says this
[1:37:38] the kids Redeemer now Ruth was a pagan
[1:37:40] serve Idols so was
[1:37:43] Oprah they were on their road coming
[1:37:46] back with their mother-in-law because
[1:37:49] she heard that down in Bethlehem Judea
[1:37:51] that God had lifted the plague and the
[1:37:54] people was having
[1:37:56] bread I just want to put that part in he
[1:37:58] said they're on that road coming back
[1:38:01] yeah so we
[1:38:02] see when their husband died now they're
[1:38:06] on a road they're on a journey now going
[1:38:09] back amen so on this journey you got to
[1:38:13] First make the right decision to start
[1:38:16] so you can get on the
[1:38:19] journey are you with me but now watch
[1:38:22] this he said oh
[1:38:24] Opa was a type of the lukewarm church
[1:38:28] that once started he going to placed
[1:38:31] them in the journey Oprah is the one
[1:38:34] once started but didn't make it right
[1:38:37] but Ruth started and
[1:38:41] finished are we
[1:38:43] together let's go to Ruth chapter 1
[1:38:50] ver8 verse eight says and Naomi said un
[1:38:53] her
[1:38:54] daughters-in-law
[1:38:56] go return each to her mother's house the
[1:38:59] Lord deal County with you as you have
[1:39:03] dwelt with the dealt with the dead and
[1:39:05] with
[1:39:07] me out of everything that they going
[1:39:09] through Naomi now trying to get rid of
[1:39:11] both of them return yeah see that's this
[1:39:15] Christian Journey yeah that's right the
[1:39:17] devil going to tell you
[1:39:21] return it's all right to go to church
[1:39:24] it's all right to sing it's all right to
[1:39:25] be a part of the church but still hold
[1:39:27] on to some of your worldly activities
[1:39:29] and your worldly desire hold on Naomi
[1:39:32] trying to get rid of her go back but you
[1:39:34] know in this right here they both passed
[1:39:37] the
[1:39:39] test Naomi I mean Ruth and Ora they both
[1:39:44] passed ain't going
[1:39:47] nowhere right here with you we going to
[1:39:49] follow you same as people today oh
[1:39:52] hallelujah praise in
[1:39:55] Jesus I ain't going nowhere I Love You
[1:39:58] Lord I'm right here I'm right here
[1:40:01] Lord come on I'm on my journey I decided
[1:40:04] to follow Jesus no turning back come on
[1:40:08] and then we little time go back if
[1:40:10] they're not seal it ain't the singing
[1:40:12] the song where could we go no where did
[1:40:15] they

[1:40:23] verse n the Lord grant you that you may
[1:40:25] find rest each of you in the house of
[1:40:28] her husband then she kissed them they

[1:40:53] going to still be able to take it right
[1:40:55] are you going to stay on your decision
[1:40:57] because the whole scope of Israel coming

[1:41:03] you to go through these things to see
[1:41:05] whether you would be obedient or
[1:41:09] not God takes us through things just to
[1:41:11] see are we going to be obedient are we
[1:41:13] going to continue to still follow him
[1:41:16] against all of the things that going
[1:41:19] wrong they passed the test verse 11
[1:41:24] Naomi said turn again my
[1:41:27] daughters why will you go with me are

[1:41:49] hope if I should have a husband also
[1:41:51] tonight and she also bear Sons would you
[1:41:55] te for them till they were grown Bo she
[1:41:58] really putting some heat on them would
[1:42:00] you stay for them from having husband
[1:42:02] but she really putting heed upon them
[1:42:05] nay my daughters for it grievously much
[1:42:08] for your sakes that the hand of the Lord
[1:42:10] is gone out against me they lifted up
[1:42:13] their voice and wept and Oprah kissed
[1:42:16] her mother-in-law but root clay unto her
[1:42:19] Oprah fell right think about it
[1:42:24] na put some heat on
[1:42:27] them same thing today she thought I'm
[1:42:29] too old would you wait for the boy would
[1:42:32] you same thing today start on your
[1:42:35] Christian Journey God dealing with you
[1:42:37] in a life of
[1:42:39] justification you get to a life of
[1:42:41] sanctification and then all of a
[1:42:43] sudden I want a
[1:42:48] man I want a
[1:42:50] husband and God say wait
[1:42:54] just wait let me finish dealing with you
[1:42:56] I'll give you one nah I got to I got to
[1:42:58] have a
[1:43:00] man I can see
[1:43:02] Oprah woo that's pretty
[1:43:06] hard man let's just say she was
[1:43:09] 30 man I'm 30 years old you're old if it
[1:43:13] was a
[1:43:14] possibility and I have to wait till at
[1:43:16] least
[1:43:18] 18 oh no no no I ain't marrying no baby
[1:43:22] I need a man man that's with a lot of
[1:43:25] young girls in this message they think
[1:43:27] they got to have a
[1:43:29] man I need a boyfriend I need a man I
[1:43:33] can't I can't wait I can't wait surely
[1:43:35] he ain't converted but when we get
[1:43:37] married he'll get
[1:43:41] converted no you get
[1:43:43] converted then God give you a husband
[1:43:46] that's
[1:43:48] converted pressure but Ruth said the
[1:43:53] Bible says she cleave Ruth had it in her
[1:43:56] mind man or no man will you die where
[1:44:01] you laid whoever your God will be my God
[1:44:04] hallelujah whether I even get married or
[1:44:06] not long as I got Jesus Christ that's my
[1:44:08] first husband I'm fine Ruth had a clear
[1:44:13] decision but today all my friends are
[1:44:16] getting married I'm going to be an old
[1:44:18] mother hover before I get married look
[1:44:20] at me come on
[1:44:23] that's nonsense that's nothing but the
[1:44:24] devil plag of your mind because what it
[1:44:26] is God oh God can't give you a husband
[1:44:30] God can't give you a wife yes he can
[1:44:33] that's right but he want you to marry
[1:44:34] him
[1:44:35] first you marry him first then he'll
[1:44:38] give you
[1:44:41] one
[1:44:43] patience Ruth went through all of this
[1:44:47] all of this are we
[1:44:50] together verse 14
[1:44:55] note verse
[1:44:57] 15 what Ruth was actually doing when the
[1:45:01] Bible said she cled unto her Ruth was
[1:45:04] fulfilling Jude 13 behold when I gave
[1:45:08] you all diligence to write unto you of
[1:45:09] the common salvation it was needful for
[1:45:12] me to write unto you and exalt you that
[1:45:14] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:45:16] faith which was once delivered unto the
[1:45:18] Saint Ruth was fulfilling that she was
[1:45:21] earnestly going to contend for it
[1:45:24] verse 15 says she said
[1:45:27] behold turn the heat on her again Ruth
[1:45:31] them pass them test but they going to
[1:45:32] bring the heat up again she said behold
[1:45:35] thy sister-in-law is gone back to her
[1:45:37] people and to her Gods return Thou after
[1:45:41] thy
[1:45:42] sister-in-law my goodness well what did
[1:45:45] Ruth do Ruth said in her entreat me not
[1:45:48] to leave thee or leave the message let
[1:45:51] me read that again and Ruth said entreat
[1:45:53] me not to leave thee or return from
[1:45:56] following after thee for where thou
[1:45:58] goest I will go and where thou lest I
[1:46:01] will LGE thy people shall be my people
[1:46:03] and thy God shall be my God cuz Ruth had
[1:46:06] that clearcut decision and we're going
[1:46:09] to let nothing stop her from going all
[1:46:11] of the way that's where it starts young
[1:46:14] people oh if you're here tonight you're
[1:46:15] not born again that's where it starts
[1:46:18] when you don't make that decision I
[1:46:19] don't care what happens to me I'm going
[1:46:22] to follow God I'm going to serve him and
[1:46:25] I'm going to stay on this journey until
[1:46:27] he fill me with his holy spirit
[1:46:30] AML it ain't going to let nothing shake
[1:46:32] me off she said your your sister-in-law
[1:46:35] went back to her people you hear all
[1:46:37] this noise this one left the message
[1:46:39] this one left the message what that got
[1:46:41] to do with me who leads the message my
[1:46:44] soul have no pleasure like Paul said and
[1:46:46] them that draw back but I got to keep
[1:46:49] moving I got to keep pressing on cuz I
[1:46:52] know where can I go these are the words
[1:46:55] of eternal life Whom Shall I go to
[1:46:57] there's nowhere else to go if God takes
[1:47:00] you from this message that mean he got
[1:47:02] something better for you to go but I'm
[1:47:04] here to tell you it ain't nothing better
[1:47:06] this is
[1:47:07] it God don't gave everything he don't
[1:47:11] gave us
[1:47:14] everythingall praise the Lord we're in
[1:47:16] the same time with Abraham and Isaac
[1:47:19] what did the Bible say Isaac the
[1:47:21] children that Abraham had by the
[1:47:23] concubines he gave him
[1:47:25] gifts but to Isaac he said he gave him
[1:47:29] all let them have the gifts but God
[1:47:32] don't giving me the all what is the all
[1:47:35] him him living inside of my soul that is
[1:47:38] the
[1:47:44] all few more minutes
[1:47:46] BR three more
[1:47:51] minutes we see here
[1:47:55] after that clear-cut
[1:47:58] decision the prophecy Des he had to have
[1:48:02] clear-cut
[1:48:04] decision I talk to people sometimes I
[1:48:07] know the decision is not
[1:48:09] clear having a Bible study with a woman
[1:48:12] she said people ask me so many
[1:48:15] questions she said I try to answer them
[1:48:18] best I can she that's why I come to your
[1:48:21] Bible studies to get answers I said
[1:48:22] sound wonderful that sound she said I
[1:48:25] want them to know God I want them to see
[1:48:28] God and so forth she said if there's a
[1:48:32] God I said whoa whoa she said huh I said
[1:48:36] did you hear what you just said
[1:48:38] woman I said you said if there's a God
[1:48:40] said yeah I said you ain't going to help
[1:48:42] nobody that's right I said you don't
[1:48:45] even know who he is yourself how you
[1:48:47] going to help somebody if there is a God
[1:48:53] if you don't have a clear understanding
[1:48:55] of what God has done in this day you go
[1:48:58] out there and trying to testify it going
[1:49:00] to hurt
[1:49:02] you that's why you need to know yourself
[1:49:05] study to show thyself approved to know
[1:49:07] where you're
[1:49:08] at when I preach to the young people I
[1:49:11] encourage them you come to a place in
[1:49:12] your life when you are challenged on
[1:49:14] what you believe you can take them to
[1:49:16] the word this is why I believe this not
[1:49:18] saying because my church preached this
[1:49:20] my pastor preached this this is why I do
[1:49:22] do this no you'll be able to go in the
[1:49:24] word yourself say this is why and that's
[1:49:28] the way it has to be not somebody ask
[1:49:30] you a question hold on a minute
[1:49:33] mommy somebody ask me something why do
[1:49:36] we wear dresses can you help me out
[1:49:39] mommy
[1:49:42] no you can go in the word yourself
[1:49:45] that's right say this is why cuz what my
[1:49:47] lord said
[1:49:53] verse four no turn with me to Ruth
[1:49:56] chapter
[1:50:03] 2
[1:50:06] amen let's
[1:50:10] just now we see
[1:50:13] Ruth uh we ain't going to backtrack
[1:50:16] we'll just stay here we know the story
[1:50:17] how Ruth when they get back in Bethlehem
[1:50:21] Judea but said she wasn't
[1:50:25] welcome it wasn't oh no he said it
[1:50:30] wasn't that because they looked down on
[1:50:32] her cuz they knew who she was an
[1:50:35] idolatry he said that's why when God
[1:50:37] calls you he can put you amongst
[1:50:39] strangers people you don't know but he
[1:50:42] called
[1:50:43] you Ruth wasn't worried about the people
[1:50:46] she was going to meet she was stuck on
[1:50:48] her
[1:50:49] decision she wasn't worrying about who
[1:50:51] going to cross her life who not going to
[1:50:53] cross her life she was stuck on her
[1:50:56] decision and then we see now she want to
[1:50:59] go and
[1:51:00] glean she want to serve now she coming
[1:51:03] to the place serving see that goes to
[1:51:05] show you when God is really dealing with
[1:51:07] somebody hard they want to
[1:51:10] serve they want to do anything they can
[1:51:12] for the kingdom of God they just want to
[1:51:14] serve they didn't she didn't make Ruth
[1:51:15] she said that girl you get out there and
[1:51:17] you go get some bread no she didn't do
[1:51:19] that Ruth wanted to Ruth I want to know

[1:54:12] and marriages do around this
[1:54:14] message and not paying no attention your
[1:54:17] children is watching you everything you
[1:54:20] do and sa they are looking at you they
[1:54:22] absorbing it and we think we can act any
[1:54:25] kind of way at home and it ain't
[1:54:27] affecting our children on the best
[1:54:30] preaching children get is watching their
[1:54:35] parents praise the Lord marriag is a
[1:54:38] wonderful thing isn't it me and my wife
[1:54:42] we have our ups and down but the way I
[1:54:45] put it I said me and my wife never
[1:54:48] argue we just have intense Fellowship
[1:54:50] sometimes
[1:54:54] right but we love each
[1:54:58] other the prophet said the best thing
[1:55:00] about breaking up is coming back
[1:55:01] together that's where the sweetness come
[1:55:04] right it's coming back together you
[1:55:06] begin to realize he said you begin to
[1:55:08] realize well maybe I wasn't so good at
[1:55:10] this time and you maybe maybe
[1:55:12] overreacted he said that's what bring
[1:55:14] things back together when you begin to
[1:55:17] realize I wasn't the best either and you
[1:55:19] forgave me
[1:55:23] amen because the marriage that we have
[1:55:27] whether you want to accept this or not
[1:55:29] friend it it reflects your relationship
[1:55:32] you yourself personally have with
[1:55:35] God it reflects
[1:55:37] it so what are we reflecting
[1:55:41] right husband love thy
[1:55:43] wife praise the
[1:55:46] Lord I don't switch the gear but it hits
[1:55:49] but let's let's just finish this cuz you
[1:55:52] really tightening there
[1:55:54] like oh but he going to go no you were
[1:55:57] doing so good brother see that's the
[1:55:58] problem we like Revelation right right
[1:56:02] oh we love to go we want to sore oh I'm
[1:56:04] an eagle I'm an eagle I'm an eagle I'm a
[1:56:06] sore but you got to remember Eagle can't
[1:56:08] sore always he got to come down sometime
[1:56:12] too that's true and that's where the
[1:56:14] problem is at right there we don't want
[1:56:16] to look and face reality that's
[1:56:19] true you know one thing I learned
[1:56:23] and made my marriage a
[1:56:26] blessing when I came to
[1:56:28] realize me and my wife is on different
[1:56:31] levels and because I see something way
[1:56:33] up in the word I can't assume she see
[1:56:38] it no I can't do that but what I've
[1:56:42] learned if I fellowship with her around
[1:56:45] the word not just in church where me and
[1:56:47] her can sit down Fellowship in the word
[1:56:50] together I'm bringing her where I'm at
[1:56:55] cuz I got a witness to my wife too she
[1:56:57] got the witness to me we got to help
[1:57:00] each other not just assuming she's
[1:57:03] seeing what I'm seeing no I can't do
[1:57:05] that when I learn there it brought
[1:57:09] peace cuz because I was seeing something
[1:57:11] so high and then she might do something
[1:57:13] I know I want to do I'm like really how
[1:57:14] could you do that cuz she wasn't seeing
[1:57:16] what I was
[1:57:17] seeing but now I can fellowship with her
[1:57:20] in the word and we's looking at the same
[1:57:24] thing praise the Lord my goodness I tell
[1:57:28] you marriage is just a wonderful thing
[1:57:30] amen a lot of young people don't want to
[1:57:31] get married because they see so many
[1:57:33] messed up
[1:57:34] marriages but the Bible said marriage is
[1:57:36] a good thing a wonderful thing
[1:57:42] amen praise the Lord so it's a wonderful
[1:57:45] thing brother and
[1:57:47] sisters there's no way brother Ron I
[1:57:50] could finish this just no way
[1:57:52] I really ain't even got to going it's
[1:57:56] just too much brother I'm sorry but Ruth
[1:58:02] serving it's it's Ruth deciding serving
[1:58:07] resting rewarding the prophet said we
[1:58:10] are
[1:58:11] now
[1:58:14] resting he said we are resting on the
[1:58:16] Promises of
[1:58:18] God and we'll be rewarded with a rapture
[1:58:25] that's why we supposed to rest on
[1:58:26] everything God has given us I mean look
[1:58:28] at Ruth life when Ruth was serving the
[1:58:32] Bible tells us I just just love this in
[1:58:35] Ruth
[1:58:36] 2:4 it said behold Boaz came from
[1:58:41] Bethlehem said unto the
[1:58:44] reaper the Lord be with you they
[1:58:46] answered him the Lord bless thee then
[1:58:50] said Boaz to his servant that was set
[1:58:52] over the Reapers whose damsel is
[1:58:56] this what we're reading is revelation
[1:58:59] 10:1 coming to Revelation 10:7
[1:59:03] amen when Boaz come
[1:59:06] down it was many Reapers there but who
[1:59:09] did he go to head
[1:59:13] Reaper brother the brother minister is
[1:59:15] the head Reaper
[1:59:17] amen can we say amen amen he talked
[1:59:20] straight to the Head Reaper but what did
[1:59:21] he say
[1:59:22] who damel is this now the reaper is
[1:59:26] introducing Ruth to
[1:59:29] boas Hallelujah that's what this message
[1:59:32] come to do to introduce us to our
[1:59:36] Boaz can we say praise the lord it's
[1:59:38] laying right here brother the whole
[1:59:40] pattern is laying right here when I see
[1:59:41] this I get excited cuz that's
[1:59:44] me and then look at the
[1:59:47] scripture amen verse six and the servant
[1:59:50] that was set over the Reaper answer and
[1:59:53] said it is the moabit is damel that came
[1:59:55] back with Naomi out of the country of
[1:59:57] Moab verse 7even and she said I pray you
[2:00:00] let me glean and gather after the
[2:00:03] Reapers among the Sheep so she came had
[2:00:06] continued even from the morning until
[2:00:08] now that she tarried a little in the
[2:00:10] house then said Boaz to
[2:00:13] who see Revelation 10 R Ruth 47 he's
[2:00:18] talking to the
[2:00:19] reaper but Ruth 48 he talking to Ruth so
[2:00:23] now Revelation 10:7 Revelation 108 don't
[2:00:26] took the
[2:00:27] book The reer don't left the scene now
[2:00:31] he's talking directly to Ruth brother
[2:00:34] brownon don't left the scene but God is
[2:00:36] still talking directly to his bride cuz
[2:00:39] the introduction had took
[2:00:41] place
[2:00:44] Hallelujah notice verse eight he said
[2:00:48] Boaz then said Boaz unto Ruth here's
[2:00:52] thou not my daughter go not into another
[2:00:58] message cuz there are not one go not
[2:01:01] glean in another field go not get
[2:01:04] another
[2:01:05] Revelation go not following something
[2:01:07] contrary to this message neither go
[2:01:10] hence but abide here fast amen by my
[2:01:14] maidens that Bo is talking directly to
[2:01:19] Ruth that's why when I listen to these
[2:01:21] tapes when I listen to this message it's
[2:01:24] Christ talking directly to me cuz
[2:01:28] brother brandham was the mouthpiece the
[2:01:30] voice of God it was not his voice it's
[2:01:33] the voice of God that's why God in the
[2:01:36] message looking into the Unseen he said
[2:01:38] these is not the words of William Brand
[2:01:40] This is a vessel that has been yielded
[2:01:42] to me that I am using am and then
[2:01:45] brother B say I am the voice of God to
[2:01:48] you praise the Lord isn't it
[2:01:53] beautiful and when you look in the
[2:01:54] scripture Ruth
[2:01:56] 2:14 I just look and see how God don't
[2:01:59] place you in
[2:02:00] me Ruth 2114 says this Boaz said unto
[2:02:05] her at meal time which is evening
[2:02:10] time Come Thou hither eat of the bread
[2:02:14] dip thy morsel in vinegar she set beside
[2:02:19] who rapers
[2:02:22] don't you know that's uncommon for a
[2:02:24] woman to sit amongst
[2:02:27] Reapers what do that mean to you and me
[2:02:30] where God placed
[2:02:33] us the seven Church ages each messenger
[2:02:36] was a Reaper for their
[2:02:40] age is that right Paul didn't know he
[2:02:43] was the prophet of Ephesus Luther didn't
[2:02:45] know his position Wesley didn't know his
[2:02:48] position but what did God do with this
[2:02:50] message he put Ruth right in the meal
[2:02:54] time at the sit with the Reapers that's
[2:02:57] why God let you and I knows with each
[2:02:59] messenger was in each one of those
[2:03:04] ages he put us at the table at Meal Time
[2:03:08] look what he says here he says right
[2:03:12] here dip thy Morel in vinegar she sat
[2:03:15] beside the
[2:03:17] Reapers and
[2:03:19] he praise the Lord he reached her porch
[2:03:23] corn she did eat and was suffice and
[2:03:27] left so that's why we've been able to
[2:03:29] sit amongst each Reaper what Paul
[2:03:30] preached what irenius did what Martin
[2:03:33] did what Luther did what did the prophet
[2:03:35] did grab from each one of them and
[2:03:37] brought it to this day so you and I can
[2:03:40] see
[2:03:41] everything that's where he placed this
[2:03:44] Bri at me time amen that's why we see it
[2:03:48] all God had revealed everything to us
[2:03:52] but all of everything Ruth went to and I
[2:03:55] just have to close what I read to you in
[2:03:58] uh chapter 4 when all those women let
[2:04:02] her be like Leah let her be like Rachel
[2:04:06] all of the one they were despising her
[2:04:09] but now look they giving praise out of
[2:04:12] their mouth cuz now they realize this is
[2:04:16] now not just
[2:04:17] Ruth it's Miss Boaz
[2:04:22] Hallelujah the prophet said I'm no
[2:04:23] longer going to call you church he said
[2:04:26] I'll call you bride so that you'll
[2:04:30] understand are you with me friends
[2:04:33] Ruth's position placed back in the body
[2:04:36] couldn't been stopped because of
[2:04:39] illegitimacy right cuz you and I all
[2:04:42] come out of a perverted birth but that
[2:04:45] ain't going to stop predestination what
[2:04:46] God has planned for you and me the
[2:04:48] perverted verse don't stop it amen so be
[2:04:51] like well you know I born in such and
[2:04:53] such family and this this and this
[2:04:54] family this that ain't got nothing to do
[2:04:56] with you amen I have a new father I took
[2:04:59] on a new nature you see what we messed
[2:05:02] up at you trying to conjure up some old
[2:05:04] Spirits or something when you try to
[2:05:05] justify some of your attitude well we
[2:05:07] like this cuz that's the way my family
[2:05:09] was you keep confessing that you'll stay
[2:05:11] like that right I'm so thankful when we
[2:05:15] are born again we break family
[2:05:17] traits right we break family strands
[2:05:21] I'm a witness of that that I broke my
[2:05:23] family strand because I got a new
[2:05:25] father new nature and I can live higher
[2:05:29] than this praise the Lord yeah there are
[2:05:32] certain characteristics we have but
[2:05:34] certain things friend with temperaments
[2:05:36] and attitudes and stuff we can't keep
[2:05:38] justifying that cuz that's how we was
[2:05:41] raised CU we supposed to be represent
[2:05:43] represent another
[2:05:45] kingdom that's what we supposed to be
[2:05:47] representing good can we say praise the
[2:05:49] lord lord the Lord there's no way
[2:05:52] brother
[2:05:53] Ron they say the worst death is to be
[2:05:56] dragged to
[2:05:57] death and I'm not going to drag you to
[2:05:59] death maybe we can finish another time
[2:06:02] this just a series we went on for a
[2:06:04] while at my church just looking at all
[2:06:06] the things in Ruth when it come to the
[2:06:08] end of the day I see me
[2:06:12] amen when
[2:06:15] Ruth when
[2:06:18] she we just when Ruth chapter 4
[2:06:22] when she was talking to Boaz we just see
[2:06:24] the
[2:06:25] patterns Boaz told her everybody know
[2:06:28] you're a virtuous woman you don't run
[2:06:31] off of old man or young you virous SI of
[2:06:34] her testimony people begin to see that
[2:06:36] oh more bite out of rship but she seeing
[2:06:40] a
[2:06:41] character he fell in love with her so
[2:06:43] much he said I'll go play the part I'll
[2:06:45] do what you supposed to do so when Boaz
[2:06:47] went up there and saido such a
[2:06:50] one what we see now we stepped into
[2:06:53] Revelation chapter 5 when John was
[2:06:56] calling for a redeemer who is worthy to
[2:06:58] open the book we see the same pth that's
[2:07:01] why he went to a gate and that's why
[2:07:02] there was Elders there that's why in
[2:07:04] Revelation 5 you see Elders there God is
[2:07:06] showing us a whole preview of everything
[2:07:09] sitting right
[2:07:11] there are you with
[2:07:13] me but you
[2:07:17] remember Naomi testified I can't have
[2:07:21] children even if I did would you wait
[2:07:25] she was admitting I'm dried
[2:07:28] up right and the Beautiful Thing when
[2:07:32] Boaz and Ruth came into that perfect
[2:07:36] union and when they had that child who
[2:07:39] do they pass the child
[2:07:41] to
[2:07:44] Naomi so her being already dried up and
[2:07:48] so forth I believe with all of my heart
[2:07:51] when they put that baby in her arms
[2:07:54] something happened
[2:07:56] here in na armi restoration amen
[2:08:01] something happened in her body had come
[2:08:03] alive to nurse this baby cuz brother
[2:08:06] brownon said Naomi tight Israel can
[2:08:10] these Dry Bones
[2:08:13] live so when that baby fell in Naomi's
[2:08:16] arm she was no longer
[2:08:19] dry God had to do something so she could
[2:08:21] you nurse that baby and that's the same
[2:08:23] type with this message when we Rapture
[2:08:26] out of here the baby is the message when
[2:08:29] we Rapture out the same message goes to
[2:08:32] Revelation one and when Revelation one
[2:08:35] goes to the 144,000 and when they preach
[2:08:38] when they prophesy this message them dry
[2:08:41] bones don't to come alive Israel going
[2:08:44] to come alive now we can see Israel
[2:08:47] going to come alive with the same
[2:08:48] message that we got where are we to be
[2:08:50] right now not dead
[2:08:53] alive willing to
[2:08:55] testify through a life to show people
[2:08:58] look what this message done for me it
[2:09:00] changed me make me what I am
[2:09:03] today that's why nobody can talk me out
[2:09:05] of there cuz I know what it did for Bley
[2:09:10] Willams Ruth was so
[2:09:13] eliminated when she went to bo bo said
[2:09:16] who are thou she said I'm
[2:09:19] Ruth then after Bo gave her all of the
[2:09:21] promises what he going to do she went
[2:09:23] back home to her mama her mama Naomi
[2:09:26] said who ought th my
[2:09:28] daugh and the Bible said Ruth said she
[2:09:31] just told him what Bo ass said she
[2:09:33] didn't say I'm Ruth no when she be SP
[2:09:35] back to her mama she told him everything
[2:09:37] the man was going to do cuz now she
[2:09:39] ain't identifying herself as Ruth she
[2:09:41] identifying herself as boas so all I can
[2:09:44] tell you what is this message all I can
[2:09:47] tell you what it done for me all I can
[2:09:49] tell you what it's doing for me me and
[2:09:51] Christ we are one that's what it brought
[2:09:53] me to that's all I can
[2:09:55] justify that's all I can do sir this is
[2:09:58] real amen all of these types and shadows
[2:10:03] God laid the par so you and I can look
[2:10:05] back and see where we are at thank you
[2:10:09] Lord praise the Lord can we give the
[2:10:12] Lord a hand let us

[2:10:36] for us just showing the patterns how

[2:10:43] we supposed to be in this day and
[2:10:46] hour I can't say it too many times
[2:10:52] of her
[2:10:53] life come from the worst of the worst of
[2:10:56] the worst but it did not stop what you
[2:10:59] have predestinated for her so the things
[2:11:02] are today dear God but God what you have
[2:11:05] for me it is for me and no one can take
[2:11:09] that away from me amen so Lord we just
