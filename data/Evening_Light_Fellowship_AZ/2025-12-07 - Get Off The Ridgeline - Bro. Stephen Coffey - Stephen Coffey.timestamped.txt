[4:09] Let
[4:28] us stand and sing. Listen to our hearts.
[4:35] Our spirit sing
[4:40] a song of praise that flows
[4:46] from those you have reached.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; And we will use the words we know
[4:57] to tell you what an awesome God you are.
[5:04] The words are not enough to tell you.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Verse one, let's sing the first verse.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Let's worship him today as we sing to
[5:14] him today. And how do you explain?
[5:22] And how do you describe
[5:27] a love that goes from east to west
[5:32] and runs as deep as it is.
[5:39] You know all our trles
[5:44] and you know all our fears
[5:50] and words cannot express the love we
[5:55] feel but we long for you to hear. Listen
[5:59] to our heart.
[6:02] Listen to our heart
[6:07] and hear our spirit sing
[6:13] a song of praise and flow
[6:18] from those you have reached.
[6:24] And we will use the words we know
[6:29] to tell you what an awesome God you are.
[6:37] Words are not enough to tell you.
[6:44] Second verse

[8:07] are not enough to tell you of our love.
[8:16] Words are not enough.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Words are not enough
[8:22] to tell you.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; The heart language.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; That's the one that God knows. You don't
[8:36] have to tell a single person what's on
[8:38] your heart. But God knows
[8:42] &gt;&gt; what's on your heart today. He knows and
[8:45] he has a way to make a way for whatever

[15:20] to intervene. So let's remember Vanessa
[15:22] that the Lord would touch her during
[15:24] this time of her life in this surgery.
[15:27] Please remember brother Warren Arasola.

[15:33] their special meetings and pray for
[15:35] traveling mercies for brother Warren.

[16:01] them in a mighty way. Brother Freddy
[16:04] would like us to remember himself. He's
[16:06] not feeling well. He's got aches, body
[16:08] pain, and also coughing. We also want to

[16:29] touch him. Please remember Sister Monica
[16:32] Love. She's recovering from shingles.
[16:35] Let's remember her. And also, Brother
[16:37] Mikey, I would like to remember the
[16:39] Jeans family from Baghdad. They lost
[16:42] their dad Mike Jeans to an illness. So
[16:44] let's remember this family in Baghdad,
[16:46] friends of the love. Amen. Do you have a
[16:49] need today? Amen. Let's sing it again.
[16:51] Fill my cup Lord. Fill my cupord.

[18:05] brother Shawn today.
[18:08] Let's pray.
[18:12] Heavenly Father, this morning we love
[18:15] you and appreciate you. We lift our cups
[18:19] up to you this morning.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; We're thirsty, Lord. And we're hungry,
[18:26] Lord.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; We lift these needs up to you, heavenly
[18:30] father.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, I think of Jonah in the belly of
[18:36] the whale.
[18:39] He said, "Out of the belly of hell,"
[18:41] cried I.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we feel like we're in the
[18:46] belly of hell, Heavenly Father.
[18:50] But he said, "They who observe lying
[18:53] vanities forsake their own mercy."
[18:56] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I will sacrifice unto thee
[18:59] with the voice of thanksgiving."
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, so
[19:05] &gt;&gt; we lift up these needs to you, Lord. We
[19:07] thank you, Lord, for every way that you
[19:11] help us and every way that you meet our
[19:13] needs and answer our prayers. We ask you
[19:16] to come on the scene for these needs
[19:18] this morning, Lord. And may each one
[19:21] turn around, Lord, to become a
[19:24] testimony, Lord.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Help the ones that are not feeling well
[19:30] this morning and touch the ones, God,
[19:33] that need healing.
[19:36] We just ask you, Lord, to come among us
[19:39] this morning. Make yourself real to us.
[19:42] Anoint our brother as he brings the word
[19:44] Lord. Speak the words of life to us. We
[19:48] commit the service and we commit these
[19:50] needs and all the unspoken needs Lord
[19:53] into your hands in Jesus name. Amen.

[36:13] round of applause.
[36:17] Let's stand this morning.
[36:20] sing a song
[36:23] that is so awesome.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; It's where you and I are hiding.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; It's in Christ alone.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; I never get tired of singing this song
[36:33] because that's where I'm hiding. I'm
[36:35] hiding in Christ.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And what he wants, he wants Christ. His
[36:41] goal is Christ be formed in
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You
[36:45] &gt;&gt; and me.
[36:48] In Christ alone
[36:50] my hope is found.
[36:54] He is my light, my
[36:57] song.
[36:59] This is strong.
[37:01] This holy ground
[37:05] through the pierces
[37:08] and stor. What lights of love? What
[37:13] depths of peace when fears are sin when
[37:18] driving sequence
[37:37] for there's a blood in
[37:40] this
[37:42] This gift of love and righteousness
[37:48] for the one he came
[37:51] to save till on that cross
[37:55] and Jesus died. The wrath of God was
[38:01] sisfied
[38:03] for every single
[38:14] in the ground. His body

[39:46] stand.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Just a short little chorus before we
[39:51] change the order the service.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Just to be close to you.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Just to be close to you. Would that be
[39:58] your prayer today? To be closer to him.
[40:02] Just to be close to you. Oh, it's our
[40:06] heart's cry, Lord, just to be close to
[40:10] you.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, just to be close to you
[40:19] is my
[40:23] Is that your prayer today?
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Just to be close to you.
[40:30] Oh, just to be close to you.
[40:36] Oh, just to be close to you
[40:42] is
[40:43] &gt;&gt; that's your prayer today. Lift your hand
[40:45] and show him this morning.
[40:48] Just in close to you.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you today. Just to be close to
[40:56] you is my prayer today.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Just to be close to you
[41:04] is my desire. Let's sing it again now.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, just to be close to you.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Just to be close to you.
[41:20] just to be close to you.
[41:25] It's my desire.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[41:33] Isn't that your desire this morning?
[41:36] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be in the presence of
[41:38] the Lord.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be able to sing songs
[41:41] like that together.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; That's what we're supposed to do. We
[41:44] come together, we sing psalms and hymns.
[41:47] But what that does is it opens up our
[41:49] heart. We're singing the truth. We
[41:50] worship him
[41:52] &gt;&gt; in spirit,
[41:53] &gt;&gt; which is he's here.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; We feel him.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; It's such an amazing thing.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; But also in truth,
[42:01] &gt;&gt; we are singing the truth. Whether we
[42:03] feel like it or not,
[42:05] &gt;&gt; we can be close to him. He's made a way
[42:08] for you to have that this morning.
[42:10] However you came into the room, maybe
[42:12] you felt distant from him when you came
[42:14] into the room, you can be close to him
[42:16] now. That's right.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a wonderful thing?
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; It's good to be with you this morning.
[42:25] It's good to be here. Uh it's good to
[42:27] sing with you and worship with you.
[42:29] We've had a good weekend.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm just excited for the Lord
[42:34] what what what he has in store for us
[42:35] today.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Are you?
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I'd like to
[42:42] invite you, if you don't mind, while
[42:44] you're standing, let's get right into
[42:45] the word. I'd like to invite you to
[42:46] stand with me. Thank you, musicians.
[42:51] Uh, as you're standing, I'd like to
[42:52] invite you to turn with me uh to the
[42:54] book of Hebrews.
[42:57] It's good to see each and every one of
[42:58] you
[43:00] friends. And uh
[43:04] well, I only have one family member
[43:05] here, but it's good to have all all of
[43:06] you friends here.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, we're all family. I guess in a way
[43:11] that's true.
[43:14] Uh but uh we had a good time this
[43:16] weekend and uh just with the older youth
[43:19] and the older um uh group and just going
[43:23] through the word in a I guess a very
[43:26] in-depth way, very um just took
[43:29] scripture by scripture and went through
[43:30] together and uh had a good time. I guess
[43:33] you'd have to ask them if it was good,
[43:34] but we had a I had a good time uh being
[43:36] with everyone and um just the fellowship
[43:40] that we had. We um we had some pork
[43:43] tacos last night that I thought were
[43:44] going to usher us right in to glory.
[43:48] It didn't happen, but I I thought it was
[43:50] Was it Brother Mark that smoked the
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Mark
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark Stany? Lord bless you. Um I
[43:58] love poor tacos. So it was it was
[44:00] wonderful. We had a good time, good time
[44:01] together and uh I trust all that you
[44:03] were there uh that the Lord dropped
[44:05] something into your heart. He challenged
[44:07] you um to take another step and to go
[44:10] forward. Amen.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Um, that's a wonderful opportunity that
[44:14] the Lord has given us this morning. I'd
[44:16] like to read with you in uh in the book
[44:19] of Hebrews
[44:21] chapter 10.
[44:26] And I want to start in verse 35.
[44:31] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 35.
[44:37] Cast not away therefore your confidence,
[44:42] which hath great recompense of reward,
[44:47] for we have need of patience, that after
[44:49] ye have done the will of God, ye might
[44:53] receive the promise.
[44:55] For yet a little while,
[44:58] and he that shall come will come, and
[45:02] will not tarry.
[45:04] Now the just shall live by faith, but if
[45:06] any man draw back,
[45:08] my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
[45:12] But we are not of them who draw back
[45:15] unto predition,
[45:17] &gt;&gt; but of them that believe
[45:20] to the saving of the soul.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[45:25] &gt;&gt; we thank you for these few moments that
[45:27] you've given us to gather in your
[45:29] presence today. We give them back into
[45:31] your hands. I ask that you would take
[45:34] complete control
[45:35] &gt;&gt; that you would use me uh to accomplish
[45:38] your will and whatever whatever that
[45:42] would look like. Sometimes correction it
[45:46] begins in the house of the Lord.
[45:47] Sometimes we need encouragement,
[45:49] instruction, guidance, whatever it would
[45:51] be
[45:52] &gt;&gt; for each individual. I pray that you
[45:55] would come on the scene and that you
[45:56] would speak to us this morning. we give
[45:59] you the service and in the name of the
[46:01] Lord Jesus Christ do we pray and do we
[46:03] ask amen
[46:06] &gt;&gt; and amen you can be seated thank you for
[46:08] standing with me uh I'm happy to have my
[46:11] wife Sister Sarah here and uh
[46:14] we've had um just a good time here and I
[46:17] I want to get right into the service
[46:19] this morning and get right into uh what
[46:22] the Lord has pressed upon my heart and I
[46:25] feel led to go in this direction I Um, I
[46:28] want you to pull on the spirit of the
[46:31] Lord.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Um,
[46:34] my brain has been proven to only be able
[46:36] to do so much. Uh, very little actually.
[46:40] Uh, so if you pull on the spirit of the
[46:42] Lord, um, the Lord will use what little
[46:45] brain I have, uh, to to affect you
[46:48] positively and to move you a step
[46:50] forward. So, I'm asking every single one
[46:52] of you just pull on the spirit of the
[46:54] Lord. Let him speak to you. uh and and
[46:58] how he sees fit this morning.
[47:01] Now, this passage in Hebrews chapter 10,
[47:05] uh, to me, I I I was just looking at it
[47:07] and just going back through it again
[47:09] this morning, and, um, to me, it it is
[47:12] one of, uh, the strongest
[47:16] um, uh, it's it's so inspirational, but
[47:19] I believe it's one of the strongest
[47:21] exhortations that that Paul gives in
[47:23] Hebrews uh, about in endurance and a a
[47:27] steadfast faith,
[47:29] &gt;&gt; understanding who he's speaking to um in
[47:33] the book of Hebrews and I believe it's
[47:35] written there there are a lot of uh
[47:39] warnings and there are a lot of uh
[47:42] admonitions here in Hebrews. He says a
[47:46] lot of things, but in this particular
[47:49] passage of chapter 10, he changes his
[47:54] tone a little bit. And I believe he
[47:57] addresses this endurance the steadfast
[48:01] faith, this exhortation to believers
[48:03] that were discouraged or persecuted.
[48:09] They were perhaps tired or perhaps
[48:12] tempted to draw back. You can see that
[48:15] very clearly by what he's saying.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Uh we are not of them that draw back
[48:22] &gt;&gt; unto predition,
[48:23] &gt;&gt; but of them that believe.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; So he's he's referencing to those who
[48:28] whose perhaps their confidence is
[48:32] wavering. So the the tone is almost
[48:35] pastoral than it than it is uh
[48:39] condemning. And I I like that. But if
[48:41] you look at this church, they um they
[48:44] were not rebellious people. It it he he
[48:46] says very different things to this
[48:49] church than he does to the church at
[48:51] Corenth or even to the church at even at
[48:54] Ephesus or um to the church at Galat or
[48:57] whatever wherever it may be. He he
[49:00] speaks to them in a in a very comforting
[49:03] way. And this is the tone that we see
[49:06] &gt;&gt; right here before us.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 10, I I I don't see it
[49:10] being written to rebellious people, but
[49:13] to the weary.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; And that is an amazing thing.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Paul is answering the question, what
[49:19] should a believer
[49:21] do when pressure gets heavy?
[49:26] &gt;&gt; What What do we do when life gets hard
[49:28] and faith when faith begins to feel
[49:32] costly?
[49:34] when you really do begin to have to
[49:36] sacrifice
[49:37] &gt;&gt; what you want or what you think.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; He's speaking to people who are at that
[49:43] point
[49:44] &gt;&gt; a point in their Christian walk where
[49:46] faith is costly. You you actually do
[49:49] have to lean not unto your own
[49:51] understanding
[49:53] &gt;&gt; and you really come to a place where you
[49:54] realize I I am not able to make it
[49:57] through and my own brain is not going to
[50:00] be able to carry me forward. I I'm going
[50:03] to have to genuinely rely on where my
[50:05] faith is anchored, which is the person
[50:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; And that's who he's speaking to here.
[50:12] He's speaking to them that are weary, to
[50:15] them that are are in need of a boost of
[50:20] confidence.
[50:23] Now I look at this and when you look at
[50:26] this term and I was looking at this a
[50:27] few weeks ago uh verse 36 for ye have
[50:31] need of patience and I I was looking at
[50:34] that word and perhaps you've looked at
[50:36] that word and it should be very familiar
[50:37] to us um in the English sense but when
[50:40] you look at it in the Greek and and and
[50:43] things like that um uh and begin to
[50:46] really ponder on what that word looks
[50:49] like for you because it's one thing to
[50:52] read it and to believe it, but when it
[50:56] when it actually becomes a reality for
[50:58] you and you have to be patient,
[51:01] &gt;&gt; it may look very different than what
[51:03] you're looking at on the page.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; And so what patience actually looks like
[51:08] for you this morning or perhaps you've
[51:11] you have had to be patient and you know
[51:14] the challenges therein. So whatever it
[51:17] may look like for you, when you get down
[51:20] into that word, what it means, it it
[51:23] means unwavering endurance and a
[51:26] steadfast
[51:27] perseverance.
[51:29] Now, Brother Brandham preaches
[51:32] perseverance. I I think um I counted 11
[51:37] times, but I I think it could be more.
[51:39] And he he entitles it perseverant.
[51:41] Perseverance.
[51:43] And uh every time and I was looking
[51:45] through each one of those services and
[51:47] the differences between the two and
[51:48] there's not a lot in the thought.
[51:51] There's not a lot of variance in the
[51:52] thought that he gives. He brother Benham
[51:55] will naturally go to different topics
[51:57] within the sermon and it also would
[51:59] depend on where he was at. But in in
[52:02] most all of those services, all the 11
[52:04] times that he preaches that,
[52:07] he he gives a very clear definition as
[52:11] to what perseverance is, steadfast
[52:14] perseverance. And that is the the Greek
[52:17] definition. It's it's in the definition.
[52:19] It's in the word of patience. And Paul
[52:22] is here to that church, to the Hebrew
[52:24] church, saying, "Ye have need of
[52:27] patience that after that ye have done
[52:30] the will of God, you can receive the
[52:31] promise." So patience is going to be a
[52:34] necessity.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; It's it's not a um no, I don't think
[52:38] I'll need it. Uh I think I'm good. Uh
[52:40] it's you you you will have to you you
[52:43] have need of patience.
[52:47] Every one of you in this room have need
[52:50] of a steadfast perseverance.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Now, when brother Brandham preaches
[52:55] that, he uses the the and he he he very
[52:59] clearly says the definition of what it
[53:02] is. It's a it's a a continued effort
[53:07] to do or achieve something despite
[53:10] difficulties, failures or opposition.
[53:15] It is it is continuing on. Perseverance
[53:19] is what happens
[53:21] when revelation drops into your soul.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; And he says that faith and and
[53:30] perseverance are brothers.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; He said when you have faith, you can
[53:35] persevere in it.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; So perseverance is uh uh it's never
[53:42] quitting. It's it's it's an it's a
[53:45] continued effort to do or to achieve
[53:48] something in spite of the difficulty and
[53:51] the failure and the opposition.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a continuing.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; It is a uh we persevere
[54:01] from the revelation that we have.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe that that that calling,
[54:07] the call of the Holy Spirit upon your
[54:09] life uh and I to me and I'll just share
[54:15] I'll just say it like this. To me, uh I
[54:18] when I witness to somebody or I share
[54:20] the gospel, I I always immediately I
[54:23] don't really go deep down into very
[54:26] doctrinal things right away.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; I always share to them what has happened
[54:31] to me
[54:33] &gt;&gt; because I want them to see that
[54:34] something has happened way down
[54:38] &gt;&gt; that I was not convinced of. Oh,
[54:41] &gt;&gt; nobody convinced me into the message of
[54:43] the hour.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; But I share that something has happened
[54:46] to change me
[54:48] &gt;&gt; from from death
[54:50] &gt;&gt; unto life.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; I am new in I am made new in Christ
[54:55] Jesus. I am old things have literally
[54:57] passed away
[54:59] &gt;&gt; and there was a voice out of heaven. You
[55:01] look at Revelations 4 1 and 2. There was
[55:05] a voice out of heaven that called to me
[55:08] &gt;&gt; and called my name. Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Not a group out there or somewhere or
[55:13] some other person's name. A voice out of
[55:16] heaven called my name.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; And said, "This is the time that I want
[55:20] you to come up hither.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to be in me and I want to be
[55:25] in you and I I want to be in unity with
[55:28] you, the a member of my bride." It was a
[55:31] personal thing. It wasn't a doctrinal
[55:33] thing that I was convinced of. It was
[55:35] the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:38] revealing himself to me.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; And when he did that, I was and I
[55:43] received his life.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; And I stepped into being a uh uh uh of
[55:50] the original seed, stepped into being a
[55:52] seed, word bride, and I stepped into
[55:56] being uh a manifestation of the word of
[55:59] God.
[56:00] the only grace that the person that
[56:02] you're talking to may actually ever
[56:04] experience.
[56:06] But when that happened in me, I I I I I
[56:09] wasn't convinced into it.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; So, nobody can convince me out of it.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't convince me
[56:18] otherwise because it's the person of the
[56:20] Lord Jesus Christ that has unveiled
[56:23] himself to me
[56:25] &gt;&gt; in in and I I walk in that newness of
[56:28] life.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I'm changed.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; You can't convince me otherwise.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; I see me.
[56:37] I see all my failure, all my inequality,
[56:40] all my issues, all that I am.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; I see my failures. But I also see him
[56:47] &gt;&gt; and he is in me. It is truly a mystery
[56:50] unto all of us as Gentiles.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Christ in us, the hope of glory.
[56:54] Hallelujah.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; I am a representation of what Paul said
[57:00] to to the um to the Colossians. It is
[57:03] Christ in me.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; And as a result, yet though I live in
[57:08] the flesh. Yet though I live,
[57:10] &gt;&gt; I live with Christ in me.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; He lives through me.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; I just it's it's there. A sheep bears
[57:19] wool.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; It just happens. And that's what's
[57:23] happened to me. Now, that can happen to
[57:25] you this morning
[57:27] &gt;&gt; because perhaps you are thinking here,
[57:30] sitting here, I don't know, but if you
[57:32] are, just for a moment, I I want you to
[57:34] understand you don't have to live like
[57:36] that.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; You don't have to live just adhering to
[57:39] a a set of doctrines.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Uh we must be in uh in true in our
[57:45] doctrine,
[57:46] &gt;&gt; right? We must seek truth in our
[57:48] doctrine. But that's not what I'm I'm
[57:51] the doctrine or the the the words on the
[57:54] page don't save me. The person of the
[57:56] Lord Jesus Christ does
[57:58] &gt;&gt; and I must know him. And you can know
[58:01] him regardless of what you've
[58:03] experienced in your life.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; All your failures, whatever
[58:08] &gt;&gt; you can know him this morning
[58:10] &gt;&gt; in the newness of his of his life. It's
[58:12] it's a it can be a fresh anointing on
[58:15] you this morning. Amen.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; You can truly know him in a in a
[58:19] fellowship that will change you.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; You you will pass from death unto life.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; That is available for you this morning.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; You have only need to receive it.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Because he has already extended the
[58:32] offer.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; He is here this morning and he can give
[58:35] that to you. While while they yet spake,
[58:38] the Holy Ghost fell. But even if you
[58:40] need a touch after having received the
[58:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you need a
[58:44] restoration or a touch, he can give that
[58:47] to you right now.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; You can have that. But I I um after I
[58:58] have received
[58:59] that and I have been changed
[59:03] from that point from there now I can be
[59:08] perseverant in the truth.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; I can be perseverant in the faith.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; I can continue as the definition is of
[59:16] perseverance. I can continue
[59:18] steadfastly. I can I can have that
[59:21] continued effort uh in despite of the
[59:24] difficulty, despite of the failure and
[59:27] despite the opposition and the action of
[59:32] um uh uh of of opposition. I can
[59:35] persevere in the midst of it
[59:38] &gt;&gt; because I know who I am in Christ Jesus
[59:42] &gt;&gt; as a walking in the light of this day.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; I can now continue without wavering.
[59:49] Amen.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Before you can
[59:52] be perseverant, you have to have faith
[59:54] in what you're trying to achieve."
[59:58] &gt;&gt; We must, we can be perseverant in our
[1:00:01] faith.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And when Paul says this, "Cast away
[1:00:05] therefore not your confidence, which you
[1:00:06] have great recompense of reward, for you
[1:00:08] have need of patience." That patience,
[1:00:12] that endurance comes from knowing your
[1:00:15] identity in the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Your, we were talking about this
[1:00:19] yesterday, your identity is not as a a a
[1:00:24] member of evening light fellowship,
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; because what if evening, heaven forbid,
[1:00:28] what if evening light fellowship didn't
[1:00:30] exist?
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Then would you just be like, I don't
[1:00:32] know who I am. I don't know what I am
[1:00:34] anymore.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; You would still be a son and daughter of
[1:00:38] God.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And that's your identity.
[1:00:41] And the Lord has placed you in evening
[1:00:43] light fellowship
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; to serve him and to uh uh push your
[1:00:47] shoulder to the wheel and to persevere.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Your identity is in Christ.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Ye have need of patience when you know
[1:00:56] who you are.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; That after ye have done the will of God,
[1:01:00] you might receive the promise. Amen.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; So Paul is encouraging the Hebrews,
[1:01:06] don't cast away your confidence
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; for yet a little while,
[1:01:11] and he that shall come will come and
[1:01:14] will not tarry. What an amazing thing.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I would um I'd like you to turn
[1:01:21] with me to 1st Samuel chapter 17.
[1:01:28] And I think
[1:01:30] we should come to 1st Samuel 17
[1:01:32] frequently.
[1:01:35] Uh but I want to go here today.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 17.
[1:01:41] Now
[1:01:44] the uh the setting
[1:01:47] of 1st Samuel 17
[1:01:50] we see in the valley of Ilah. It was a
[1:01:53] natural uh battleground.
[1:01:57] You you you know where I'm you know you
[1:02:00] know what I'm talking about. It was a
[1:02:02] natural battleground. If you've ever
[1:02:04] been there, it's an amazing place. It's
[1:02:06] an amazing thing. And um it's a long uh
[1:02:10] flat place between two opposing ridges.
[1:02:13] And it was perfect for battle. Uh I love
[1:02:17] oldtime warfare because it it was such
[1:02:20] thought that both sides put into it. It
[1:02:22] was just, oh, this is a good place for
[1:02:23] them. This is a good place for us. Um,
[1:02:25] this looks good. We'll take it. And it
[1:02:29] happened all the way up to the uh Civil
[1:02:31] War. Um, oh, this is good ground. That's
[1:02:33] good ground. It's it's going to work for
[1:02:34] both of us. We'll come together um in a
[1:02:36] very, you know, they know what we're
[1:02:38] going to do and we know what they're
[1:02:39] going to do. And and I I just don't
[1:02:41] understand the warfare, but
[1:02:43] I guess someone did, and it seemed to
[1:02:45] work uh for them. But this is the way
[1:02:47] that warfare happened. they would come
[1:02:48] together and they would face one another
[1:02:50] and then they would encamp and they
[1:02:52] would they would uh get together and and
[1:02:54] um the in this particular case the um
[1:02:58] the Philistines were coming out from uh
[1:03:02] uh uh there a few different particular
[1:03:05] cities. There were a lot of different
[1:03:06] Philistines coming uh Philistine
[1:03:09] villages that were coming together and
[1:03:11] um the the same was also true of Israel.
[1:03:14] And then they they both armies uh the
[1:03:17] Israelites and the Philistines came
[1:03:19] together within this valley. And um
[1:03:24] this particular time, we're very
[1:03:27] familiar with this scene.
[1:03:29] Um Goliath
[1:03:32] uh very big man, very tall man. He comes
[1:03:36] out and the Philistines uh for 40 days
[1:03:39] Goliath stepped into that valley and
[1:03:42] issued the same exact challenge.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:03:48] and he he
[1:03:50] there was no um you know we're going to
[1:03:53] attack you after this and things like
[1:03:54] that. He all they did was they just sent
[1:03:57] Goliath out
[1:03:59] in in a in a means to intimidate. And we
[1:04:02] know that story very well. But what I
[1:04:05] really want you to do is at this
[1:04:07] particular moment in time, we are, you
[1:04:09] know, the story of what's happening down
[1:04:12] where Goliath is very well. Now, David
[1:04:14] is not there yet. He's off somewhere.
[1:04:17] But this is something that we're very
[1:04:19] familiar with, but I want you just for a
[1:04:21] moment to take yourself and put yourself
[1:04:24] in the shoes of one of those soldiers
[1:04:26] that are looking down into that valley.
[1:04:29] And that's a perspective that we rarely
[1:04:31] take. And I was thinking about this and
[1:04:33] I I've had this on my heart for a very
[1:04:35] long time.
[1:04:38] And the amazing thing about all of these
[1:04:40] Israelite soldiers
[1:04:43] is that they were
[1:04:46] in the promised land for 400 years,
[1:04:50] roughly 400 years. A lot of generations
[1:04:53] had passed since the Israelites had
[1:04:55] possessed the land. They they had
[1:04:58] possessed the land. Yes,
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; they they had driven out a lot of
[1:05:02] armies. They had gone through fighting
[1:05:04] their their uh armor, the Saul's armor,
[1:05:07] it was it was um crafted to the warfare
[1:05:10] that they they had fought for many many
[1:05:12] many years. So the Israelites at this
[1:05:15] point had been in the promised land for
[1:05:18] a very long time and they they were
[1:05:22] possessing it. They had possessed it and
[1:05:25] so they were where they should be. And
[1:05:28] in this particular scenario, the
[1:05:31] Israelites are there and the Philistines
[1:05:33] are coming into the land and it's they
[1:05:36] they've they've crossed the border and
[1:05:38] they're right there and they're looking
[1:05:39] and then they send Goliath out and the
[1:05:41] Israelites the normal warfare would be
[1:05:43] okay, the Philistines are going to be
[1:05:44] here um you know Saul and the and the
[1:05:46] military people are going to and we're
[1:05:48] going to go boom boom boom boom and then
[1:05:50] uh we'll run them out and then we'll
[1:05:51] win. But this scenario is different
[1:05:54] because they sent out Goliath to
[1:05:56] intimidate.
[1:05:58] So again, now put yourself in the shoes
[1:06:00] of one of these soldiers on the
[1:06:01] sidelines because if you if if we look
[1:06:04] at it, they were precisely where they
[1:06:08] should be.
[1:06:10] They were precisely where they should
[1:06:12] have been.
[1:06:13] They were in the promised land having
[1:06:16] already possessed it.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And they were suited up, armored up,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; having gone to war.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; They were not saying, "I don't care. I'm
[1:06:25] not going to go. Maybe the Philistines
[1:06:27] won't come all the way in. If they do,
[1:06:28] so what? They It wasn't the attitude
[1:06:30] here.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; They were at war.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; They were in the fight.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; They were suited up. They were armored.
[1:06:38] They were ready to go. They were
[1:06:40] standing on the other ridge line and
[1:06:42] they were looking down into the valley.
[1:06:45] But there was Goliath. Yeah.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And what I'm amazed about and I believe
[1:06:51] that if we if we see the light of this
[1:06:54] day, brother Benham said we would have
[1:06:55] seen the light of that day.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; But put yourself in their shoes.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; If you were an Israelite looking down
[1:07:03] and the challenge was send out your best
[1:07:05] champion. So all of those soldiers were
[1:07:07] like, "Okay, well who's the best
[1:07:08] champion?"
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; And the attitude is sometimes, okay,
[1:07:12] well where are the ministers?
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Send them out.
[1:07:17] And the attitude is, okay, where's the
[1:07:19] champion, Saul? Saul, where's the
[1:07:21] champion? The champion's out. And it's
[1:07:24] not that they weren't um
[1:07:27] uh it's not that they weren't unwilling
[1:07:29] to fight. It's that they were just
[1:07:31] standing there in their position, suited
[1:07:33] up, ready to fight.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; But just halting
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; and just standing in the promised land,
[1:07:40] suited up, ready for for war, standing
[1:07:43] there.
[1:07:45] And I wonder how many of us in this room
[1:07:49] either feel or are in the exact same
[1:07:53] place
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; because these men were persevering.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; They were I mean look if we look at the
[1:08:02] definition now of what Paul is saying ye
[1:08:04] have need of patience. They were being
[1:08:07] patient.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; They were being perseverant. They they
[1:08:11] had a they were they had a continued
[1:08:13] effort to do or achieve something
[1:08:15] despite the difficulties or failure or
[1:08:18] opposition. They were suited up and they
[1:08:20] were saying okay well you know for 40
[1:08:23] days they were saying okay well what
[1:08:27] what do we maybe we should send a
[1:08:29] champion out. Saul and everybody are
[1:08:31] trying to figure out what to do. And
[1:08:33] then the Israelites are there they
[1:08:35] haven't gone home. They haven't sherked
[1:08:37] their responsibility. It's not like they
[1:08:39] they gave up and left. They were there.
[1:08:42] They were standing there for 40 days.
[1:08:46] And Goliath is saying, "You cowards."
[1:08:50] And the enemy standing across from them
[1:08:53] is taunting them.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; You cowards,
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; you say that you're the the army of the
[1:09:00] living God, but where's your champion?
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. and he's taunting for 40 days
[1:09:06] and he's he's trying to get them to make
[1:09:08] a a move because he knows he has the
[1:09:11] advantage against uh a regular he thinks
[1:09:15] he has the advantage against a regular
[1:09:17] soldier.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Even the greatest of the champions, he
[1:09:21] thinks and he he that's his his mindset
[1:09:23] is okay, I'm going to go out and and
[1:09:24] intimidate because I've got a physical
[1:09:26] advantage on their greatest champion. So
[1:09:28] when we kill them, then we're going to
[1:09:30] be good. And that was the the
[1:09:31] intimidation tactic here. And the
[1:09:34] Israelites suited up for armor standing
[1:09:36] on the inside. And I wonder how many of
[1:09:38] us feel the same way where we are in the
[1:09:41] promised land. Holy Ghost fil believers
[1:09:44] walking in the light of our day. We are
[1:09:47] in we we are in the word. We have been
[1:09:51] in the word. And yet you feel,
[1:09:56] and if you'll allow me just to say it in
[1:09:58] that way, you feel like you're standing
[1:10:00] on the ridge line looking down in the
[1:10:02] valley and you're thinking, "Well, here
[1:10:05] I am. I'm suited up. I'm ready for war.
[1:10:08] I'm not unwilling to fight, but that
[1:10:12] seems very insurmountable. I I I don't
[1:10:14] like, should I? Should I not? I don't
[1:10:17] know exactly where you should be."
[1:10:22] persevering,
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; but halting slightly.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; And I'll be honest with you, I feel like
[1:10:29] that a lot.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; I can I've felt like that many times
[1:10:32] throughout my life as a Holy Ghost fil.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand something.
[1:10:40] You don't have to feel that way.
[1:10:43] You don't have to feel like you're just
[1:10:46] uh uh um someone who's just standing on
[1:10:49] the ridge line
[1:10:52] wondering what to do.
[1:10:54] You don't have to feel like that. Now,
[1:10:57] here's the interesting thing and I want
[1:10:59] you just to um just think with me here
[1:11:01] for a second now. when uh and I was I
[1:11:04] was looking and I was just studying
[1:11:06] through and trying to figure out um when
[1:11:08] brother Brandon would talk about
[1:11:09] perseverance, what was the what was the
[1:11:12] next thing? What what would he say? What
[1:11:14] would be the um you know the next part
[1:11:16] of that? And when he would say uh to be
[1:11:19] perseverant to um you know when I am
[1:11:23] perseverant then then what happens?
[1:11:25] What's the next step here? What do I do?
[1:11:27] Now look at this. He would say in uh uh
[1:11:31] uh uh in Perseverant 1963, he said, "Now
[1:11:35] John knew it. He wasn't afraid of
[1:11:37] failure. That was his charge and that
[1:11:41] was his commission. So he could be very
[1:11:45] perseverant."
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Knew his commission and so therefore he
[1:11:52] could be very perseverant. And you can
[1:11:56] be very perseverant when you have faith.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; When you have a revelation of who Christ
[1:12:03] has made you to be.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Then you can be perseverant.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; But brother Ben Brandham takes it a step
[1:12:09] further and he says when John understood
[1:12:12] his his commission then he could be very
[1:12:16] perseverant.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; He could persevere within that
[1:12:20] commission. He would say uh a few
[1:12:22] paragraphs later, he said, "Now, no
[1:12:24] matter what what they say, why they'll
[1:12:26] throw you in jail. The ministerial
[1:12:28] association will kick you out. You'll
[1:12:30] have you won't have any fellowship.
[1:12:31] There's no cooperation." Didn't make any
[1:12:33] any didn't make John any difference. He
[1:12:37] was perseverant.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; He had a message and somebody must hear
[1:12:42] it.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. In 1962
[1:12:46] in the sermon perseverance, he says
[1:12:48] this, brother Benham, now talk about
[1:12:50] perseverance.
[1:12:52] Moses, he walked right up in the face of
[1:12:54] Pharaoh and said, "Let them go." Why? He
[1:12:58] talked face to face with God
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; till he had his commission. Yeah.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; And I think if minister brethren today
[1:13:08] would just not take it from an
[1:13:11] intellectual standpoint,
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; but would find them a place on the back
[1:13:15] side of the desert on those sacred sands
[1:13:17] where Satan cannot place his dirty feet
[1:13:20] of unbelief and stay there until a
[1:13:23] message comes from God and positionally
[1:13:25] places you in the ministry. Then all the
[1:13:27] devils out of torment can't shake you
[1:13:30] from it.
[1:13:32] He takes perseverance and he brings it
[1:13:34] one step further into commission. Now if
[1:13:38] you look at where brother Benham talks
[1:13:40] about commission he says now first there
[1:13:41] is and this is in the sermon influence.
[1:13:44] He says first there comes a cleansing.
[1:13:47] Notice the following the cleansing was a
[1:13:50] commission. Oh my. Yes. First a
[1:13:53] confession then a cleansing and then a
[1:13:57] commission.
[1:13:59] Now, if we look at Revelations 10:7,
[1:14:03] that is not the end of the story.
[1:14:07] We focus a lot on Revelations 10:7
[1:14:10] because it's what we believe
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:14:14] angel.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; We believe that. There is no doubt. We
[1:14:18] believe that. We can have confidence in
[1:14:20] that. We've seen it.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be convinced of it.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; I see it. Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Now, if I um if we I and I I I think
[1:14:31] about this a lot, but I I always um and
[1:14:35] I think uh Brother Ron and I you were
[1:14:37] you were talking about um Believe the
[1:14:39] Sign the other day. And I I'll just be
[1:14:41] honest with you, Believe the Sign has
[1:14:43] never really affected me uh uh um in
[1:14:46] terms of uh uh uh what I believe,
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Um because I look at their arguments.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think, is that literally the
[1:14:56] best you have?
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Have you read the Bible?
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Because there's no scriptural arguments
[1:15:04] there.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; It's well, it may not have been so many
[1:15:08] people on the bridge. They weren't
[1:15:10] there.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; They weren't there.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; They weren't there at the bridge.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; So, there's no scriptural argument
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; to say that Revelations 10:7 hasn't
[1:15:21] happened. Come on.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; There's no life to back it up. There's
[1:15:24] nothing that they point you to. There's
[1:15:27] nothing greater that they have. They
[1:15:29] tear down. That's a scoffer's message.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, don't go to a
[1:15:34] scoffer for the truth.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; So, if you want the truth, don't go to
[1:15:40] someone who's just tearing something
[1:15:41] down because they have nothing to offer
[1:15:43] you. And when you seek that as a source
[1:15:46] of truth, you will wander. and you'll go
[1:15:48] to this to this to that and you'll never
[1:15:52] be settled because you listen to a
[1:15:53] scoffer for truth
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF SAID I AM THE
[1:15:58] WAY the truth and the life
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; so if you want truth go to the word
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; go to Christ himself
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; so someone can't convince me out of the
[1:16:09] message of the hour because I met the
[1:16:11] person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; you can't convince me out of a PERSON
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; HE IS in me and I am in him.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; You won't you won't convince me out of
[1:16:25] that. I'm standing firm on that
[1:16:27] revelation and WITHIN THAT I WILL
[1:16:30] PERSEVERE.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; I will stand strong by his strength, not
[1:16:35] my own.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; I have confidence in him, not my brain.
[1:16:42] Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; I have confidence in him, NOT MY ABILITY
[1:16:45] TO understand and discern.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; He is my source of strength. I can do
[1:16:51] all things through Christ who
[1:16:52] strengthens me.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; So, if that's the best argument that you
[1:16:57] have.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying that arrogantly or
[1:17:02] flippantly. I mean it.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; You open up your Bible and let's talk
[1:17:09] about the message of the hour. That's
[1:17:11] the truth.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; I have no time for it.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; But when I I come to someone who is
[1:17:18] struggling,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; questions
[1:17:23] are okay.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that questions and
[1:17:27] having questions that's okay? Yeah.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; If someone is sitting across from me and
[1:17:32] they have they have a purpose to
[1:17:34] undermine my my belief or to witness to
[1:17:37] me to something else
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; or to witness to me that what I believe
[1:17:41] isn't true. Which doesn't make sense,
[1:17:43] but I've encountered that a lot. I I
[1:17:45] I'll stop them and I'll say, "Now hang
[1:17:47] on. What are you witnessing to me?"
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Because you're trying to convince me out
[1:17:51] of the message of the hour. That's what
[1:17:52] you're doing. What are you witnessing to
[1:17:54] me? What have you got?
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Show me what you got next. I'll listen
[1:17:58] to your arguments, but show me where
[1:18:00] you're going to bring me next. And they
[1:18:01] have nothing. They have nothing. So, I'm
[1:18:03] not going to argue like that. But if
[1:18:05] someone, and I've I've dealt with this
[1:18:07] in my church for so for so long, uh it
[1:18:10] feels like if someone has a question and
[1:18:12] say, "Well, what about this?" Or, "What
[1:18:14] about this?" I am I am right there.
[1:18:17] Let's talk about it. Let's crack open
[1:18:20] our Bibles and let's talk about it
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; because it's okay to have questions. I
[1:18:24] want to know what I believe. I have so
[1:18:26] many questions.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; I have so many questions. And I ask and
[1:18:30] I search I search the scriptures to see
[1:18:33] whether those things be true.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; I want to walk in truth.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; I want to know what I believe and be
[1:18:38] able to stand firm in it.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be wavering or
[1:18:43] double-minded. I want to walk true, walk
[1:18:45] strong, walk.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Walk circumspectly in the truth.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; And so I will search. I will seek. I
[1:18:53] will ask.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; I have I have no shame. I have no shame
[1:18:58] to ask a question
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; as if we as if we know everything in
[1:19:02] this room.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; You should never be afraid to ask a
[1:19:05] question
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; and and say, "You know what? I've never
[1:19:08] really understood this.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Can you explain it to me?"
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed at the amount of people who
[1:19:13] sit in a message church for 30 years
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; and can't explain a simple doctrine to
[1:19:18] you. Brother,
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to put you down. If that's
[1:19:21] where you are, because you have an
[1:19:23] opportunity to search
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; and to grow and to learn.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; So, if that is you, then I encourage
[1:19:30] you, seek out the truth
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; because you will find it.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; But don't go to a scoffer.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Go to the truth.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Now, Revelations 10:7, understanding
[1:19:43] that that is the truth and that has
[1:19:45] happened. That's only the beginning
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; because the reality for us is
[1:19:51] Revelations 10:8-11.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; That's what you and I fulfill. That's
[1:19:57] where we are right now.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; We fulfill Revelations 108 through 111.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; You take the book.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; A voice out of heaven says, "Come and
[1:20:08] take the book." You take it. You eat it.
[1:20:10] It becomes a part of you.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; You are changed by it.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You become what you eat.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And when you look at at that, you eat
[1:20:20] the book, it's the inward, and then you
[1:20:22] prophesy again. That's the outward. In
[1:20:24] other words, the faith that that is
[1:20:26] established by the the revelation of who
[1:20:29] Jesus Christ is to you.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Is then able to be persevered in. You
[1:20:36] are able to persevere within that
[1:20:38] revelation. You are able. It's it's a
[1:20:41] brother Benham refers to it as a keeping
[1:20:43] power. There is a keeping power there.
[1:20:46] It is the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:47] Christ. It is the Holy Spirit that leads
[1:20:50] you and guides you into all truth.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; How to be a good husband.
[1:20:58] How to be a good wife.
[1:21:01] What what it what that actually means,
[1:21:03] not a misrepresentation of it.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; How to be a good father.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; How to be a good mother.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; How to be a good grandparent.
[1:21:14] All of those things are there for you.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; We have the the full message of the hour
[1:21:22] and the the the entire word of God. The
[1:21:25] scripture is never irrelevant to the
[1:21:28] situation that you are in.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; He is a present help in the time of
[1:21:32] trouble. So he will have an answer for
[1:21:35] you. whatever you face.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Whatever difficulty, situation, trial,
[1:21:41] whatever the complexity may be, and I'll
[1:21:43] be honest with you, family and and work
[1:21:46] and society and and the economy, it is
[1:21:50] complex.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Family situations are complex.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; It's not cutting I don't know if uh
[1:21:56] maybe that's just me, but it's not cut
[1:21:58] and dry anymore.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; We got to worry about this and that and
[1:22:01] this and this factor and that person and
[1:22:02] this and that and this. It's very
[1:22:04] complex. Maybe it's always been that way
[1:22:06] since there have been families since the
[1:22:07] dawn of time. So maybe it's always been
[1:22:09] that way. Maybe we're more aware of it
[1:22:11] now.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And in that complexity, the Lord will
[1:22:16] meet you
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; as you persevere upon the revelation
[1:22:20] that he's established in you.
[1:22:23] And within that revelation, it is
[1:22:25] unfolding. You are growing. Grow in
[1:22:28] grace and in knowledge. And as you
[1:22:31] acquire the knowledge of the truth, he
[1:22:34] applies it to the complexity that you
[1:22:36] are in.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; So if you're wondering, I've what do I
[1:22:40] do in this job situation. If you are the
[1:22:42] kind of person that um you need somebody
[1:22:45] else to tell you what to do and and
[1:22:47] seeking counsel is a godly thing. But if
[1:22:50] at the end of the day you're so unsure
[1:22:51] about your step that you have you have
[1:22:53] to uh you can't make a step in
[1:22:55] confidence or assurance
[1:22:58] then you can that you don't have to live
[1:23:00] like that.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; You can walk confidently and assuredly
[1:23:05] within the word.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; He is there for you.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, a pastor is there to shepherd
[1:23:12] you and to preach the word and to
[1:23:15] establish the truth in the church,
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; but he can't hold your hand on Monday
[1:23:20] and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday.
[1:23:23] You have to pack out the revelation that
[1:23:26] he has established in you, that the Lord
[1:23:28] has established in you.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; And your pastor preaches the word and
[1:23:32] establishes that truth. You have to pack
[1:23:35] it out. And therefore that necessitates
[1:23:37] you seeking the word in a way that you
[1:23:40] can apply it to the complexity that you
[1:23:43] find yourself in
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; so that you aren't actually just a
[1:23:47] person standing on the ridge line
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; all suited up for armor and all ready to
[1:23:51] go
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; but saying well where where's the
[1:23:54] champion
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; maybe the pastor can fix this situation
[1:23:57] that I got
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; maybe and and where you should be but
[1:24:02] unwilling to step into the fight
[1:24:06] And it's an amazing thing.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; You don't have to you don't have to live
[1:24:11] as a a a believer of the message of the
[1:24:14] hour
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; in in question all the time
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; or in fear because we're not in bondage
[1:24:23] to fear anymore. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; So being that you are in the land and
[1:24:28] you have possessed it and you are there,
[1:24:32] then walk circumspectly saying, "Lord,
[1:24:34] what would you have me to do?" Proverbs,
[1:24:37] I believe it's in Proverbs, it might be
[1:24:39] in Psalms, he says like a a horse with a
[1:24:41] bridal. If you pull it this way, I'll go
[1:24:43] this way. If you pull it this way, I'll
[1:24:44] go this way. And being able to have a
[1:24:47] fellowship and a relationship with the
[1:24:49] Lord where you can discern what is right
[1:24:51] and what is wrong. And when you need
[1:24:52] clarity, there is counsel there that God
[1:24:54] has placed around you to give it to you.
[1:24:57] But you need to be able to live the the
[1:25:00] message of the hour on Monday and
[1:25:01] Tuesday and Wednesday and not live in
[1:25:03] question and in fear and in in in just
[1:25:07] uh consumed by the complexity that is
[1:25:09] life nowadays.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; You can live strong.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's within you. Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; You can you can uh understand and
[1:25:19] discern that is the enemy
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; and say, "Get thee behind me, Satan. You
[1:25:25] shall not prevail." And you can move
[1:25:27] forward.
[1:25:28] Now, if you go back with me here
[1:25:33] to 1st Samuel chapter 17
[1:25:37] and just to just to lay clarity to it, I
[1:25:41] believe that the commission
[1:25:43] in if if if we move from perseverance to
[1:25:45] commission,
[1:25:47] what I see as a consistent theme in the
[1:25:49] message of the hour, what brother Bham
[1:25:52] says is when he talks about commission,
[1:25:53] he doesn't just refer to um to a
[1:25:57] calling. He doesn't just refer to a a
[1:26:00] preacher getting a commission and then
[1:26:02] going and preaching. He doesn't just
[1:26:04] refer to it. But when he talks about
[1:26:06] perseverance and he talks about
[1:26:08] commission, he refers to the believer's
[1:26:11] godgiven obligation to act upon the
[1:26:15] revealed word of the hour.
[1:26:18] When he talks about commission, it is to
[1:26:20] obey the revealed word of the hour, to
[1:26:23] speak it, and to walk in it and to
[1:26:27] manifest it.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Of what value is it to be able to see
[1:26:32] the truth and not to apply it?
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; The message the the a believer is not
[1:26:37] called just to uh uh understand the
[1:26:41] message
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; of the hour. We are called to walk it
[1:26:45] out.
[1:26:46] We are called to be the manifestation of
[1:26:49] the promise.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; You are who he will rapture.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Not someone a far off. He raptures us.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; We are that which is quickened.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; The commission is that you you walk in
[1:27:03] the revealed word of the hour.
[1:27:04] Understand it, but obey it and speak it
[1:27:07] and manifest it.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; That you walk it out. That's the
[1:27:11] commission. a believer walking in the
[1:27:14] midst of Leodysia.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; We pack out the message of the hour. We
[1:27:18] walk it out. We live it. We press
[1:27:21] towards it.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; We don't just look at it.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; We don't just read it and say, "That's
[1:27:27] nice." And then set it aside.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; John consumed the book.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; And when he did, it caused an action.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; He prophesied. Amen.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; That's what the message of the hour
[1:27:40] should do
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; in us.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Now in
[1:27:48] 1st Samuel chapter 17, you see all the
[1:27:51] way through verses 1
[1:27:53] uh through 11.
[1:27:56] And when Saul and all Israel heard those
[1:27:59] words of the Philistine, they were
[1:28:01] dismayed
[1:28:03] and greatly afraid. All suited up. They
[1:28:07] were all in the armor. They all had the
[1:28:10] They were all there. And then
[1:28:14] this happens.
[1:28:16] Now, you can imagine
[1:28:18] you're standing there and you're
[1:28:20] thinking, now this is the story we know
[1:28:21] very well. But again, you are an
[1:28:23] Israelite on the ridge line. You're very
[1:28:25] familiar with David and Goliath. But
[1:28:27] this is you looking down and you're
[1:28:30] thinking, "What on earth? What is
[1:28:33] happening here?" Because you're
[1:28:35] thinking, "Okay, where's the champion?
[1:28:36] Let's send out the champion. Let's send
[1:28:38] out the best ministers that we have
[1:28:40] because they're the most spiritual among
[1:28:41] us. So, they'll be able to do all the
[1:28:43] things. And we we're just but humble
[1:28:46] sheep. And we will sit around and we'll
[1:28:49] be entertained for an hour at service
[1:28:51] and then go home and live confused
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; like we have nothing to live a powerful
[1:28:56] life with,
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; like we have no weapon or tool to defeat
[1:29:00] the enemy. That does easily beset us.
[1:29:06] And David waltses down into the field
[1:29:09] and we know precisely what happens.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Now, here's what I want you to
[1:29:12] understand.
[1:29:15] In verse 51,
[1:29:18] uh David um
[1:29:24] uh verse uh let's start in verse 49
[1:29:27] 47. Let's start in verse 47. And of of
[1:29:30] 17. And all this assembly shall know
[1:29:34] that the Lord saveth not with the sword
[1:29:36] and the spear, for the battle is the
[1:29:39] Lord's. This is David.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; And he will give you into your into our
[1:29:44] hands. Now, keep in mind that all the
[1:29:46] Israelites had a promise that it was
[1:29:48] their land.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; So, the Philistines had no place being
[1:29:51] where they were.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; But the Israelites were not moving. They
[1:29:55] were not acting.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; They were persevering because they
[1:29:58] showed up to the battle.
[1:30:01] And David says, "The Lord, he will give
[1:30:03] you into our hands." And it came to pass
[1:30:05] when the Philistine arose and came and
[1:30:08] drew nigh to meet David. And David
[1:30:11] hastened and ran towards the enemy or
[1:30:13] toward the army to meet the Philistine.
[1:30:16] And David put his hand in his bag and
[1:30:18] took then a stone and slang it and
[1:30:21] smokeote the Philistine in his forehead
[1:30:24] that the stone sunk into his forehead.
[1:30:27] And he fell upon his faith face upon the
[1:30:30] earth. And David prevailed over the
[1:30:33] Philistine with a sling and with a stone
[1:30:35] and smokeote the Philistine and slew
[1:30:37] him. But there was no sword in the hand
[1:30:39] of David. Therefore David ran
[1:30:44] and he stood upon the Philistine and he
[1:30:46] took his sword and drew it out
[1:30:49] and he slew him and cut off his head
[1:30:52] therewith. And when the Philistines saw
[1:30:55] this, their champion was dead. They
[1:30:58] fled.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; I love it. He We're Israelites on the
[1:31:03] ridge line looking down and we're
[1:31:05] thinking, what is happening here?
[1:31:08] because that little boy could not have
[1:31:10] done what he just did.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; But yet this has just happened. And now
[1:31:16] uh Goliath and uh sorry for the gruesome
[1:31:19] image. Uh I guess I should have I guess
[1:31:22] I should have monitored that. Um sorry
[1:31:25] children, but it happened.
[1:31:28] Uh and and so the Israelites are looking
[1:31:30] there and
[1:31:32] David ran
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; and this is how it lay.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; And all that was so fearful and all that
[1:31:42] was so um big
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; sure
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; lay dead on the battlefield. Yeah.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Now, here's what brother Brandham said
[1:31:52] about this
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; here in Why Little Bethlehem 1963. Here,
[1:31:59] Christ is represented in this both king
[1:32:04] and warrior
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; because he cut his way through. He broke
[1:32:08] the enemy's lines of death. He broke the
[1:32:10] enemy's lines so that we might have
[1:32:12] eternal life. the waters of eternal
[1:32:14] life. He came through even to death and
[1:32:17] took death upon himself and died. The
[1:32:21] warrior,
[1:32:22] we didn't conquer.
[1:32:25] It's already conquered.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; We never conquered death.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; He conquered death for us.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; He's our David of this day.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; He conquered death.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Bethlehem's bread and water. Amen.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, type David to Christ.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; In this scenario, Brother Brandham, type
[1:32:50] David to Christ, not to you,
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; but to Christ.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; We think, boy, if I could just be a
[1:32:58] David and get out there on the field.
[1:33:00] That's a good thing to desire. But do
[1:33:02] you understand that the Lord Jesus
[1:33:05] Christ has made a way
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; for the enemy to be defeated?
[1:33:11] Now, keep in mind that what happened is
[1:33:13] when David ran, he he slung the the uh
[1:33:16] he slang the sling and the the he was
[1:33:19] dead and then he cut off the head and
[1:33:21] Goliath is lying there. The scripture is
[1:33:24] very clear that the enemy fled. It is
[1:33:27] then true if we bring it into today's
[1:33:30] context that the enemy knows it is
[1:33:33] defeated.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; THAT THE ENEMY IS TRULY then a bluff.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Albeit he is very smart. The enemy is
[1:33:40] very smart. He is very shrewd. He does
[1:33:43] indeed walk about as a roaring lion. He
[1:33:46] does attack you sometimes. Vast majority
[1:33:48] of what we deal with is by our own
[1:33:50] doing.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; But the enemy does wage war and he is
[1:33:54] after you. And he does mess with you.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; He entangles himself in the COMPLEXITY
[1:34:01] THAT IS YOU.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; And he messes around.
[1:34:06] And scripturally we should know
[1:34:09] that he has no place
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; in our midst.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; The enemy has no strongholdise.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; The enemy is defeated.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; And in this scenario, David typed
[1:34:22] Christ.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; He has gone before you. He has defeated
[1:34:27] death.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; He is your conqueror.
[1:34:31] You don't have to feel like, boy, I'm
[1:34:33] never going to be able to be that
[1:34:34] spiritual titan that I want to be. HE IS
[1:34:37] YOUR spiritual titan.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; AND IT IS CHRIST IN YOU, THE hope of
[1:34:41] glory.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; It is not your strength.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; It is by his spirit, saith the Lord.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And the enemy, as a result, has has
[1:34:52] flew.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; It is gone.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; They don't have a stronghold anymore.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the amazing thing.
[1:35:00] Because remember, you're a person on the
[1:35:01] ridge line
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; and you were looking down at this whole
[1:35:04] thing. But if you look at verse 52, and
[1:35:07] the men of Israel of Judah arose
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; and shouted
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; and pursued the Philistines
[1:35:18] until thou come they until thou came to
[1:35:21] the valley and to the gates of Echron.
[1:35:24] Do you understand that? that was
[1:35:25] actually beyond where most of the
[1:35:28] soldiers of Felistia had come from. So
[1:35:30] what had happened is that the enemy now
[1:35:33] the Israelites they saw
[1:35:36] Goliath is dead
[1:35:38] and as a result of that we are in the
[1:35:41] promised land.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; We do have possession of the land. I
[1:35:45] just happen to be suited up with armor.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; I just happen to be standing here on
[1:35:50] this ridge line with an enemy that is
[1:35:52] fleeing before my face. And what it did
[1:35:55] is it built up immediately confidence.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; They were persevering. But what it did
[1:36:01] is it emboldened their commission.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; It enabled them to realize so quickly,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; I am a a child of God. I'm an Israelite.
[1:36:12] I'm suited up. I've got the armor on.
[1:36:14] The the conqueror has has defeated the
[1:36:17] enemy. The enemy is fleeing.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I will get down off of this
[1:36:23] ridge AND I WILL PURSUE my enemy.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; And that's precisely what happened.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Watching their conqueror defeat the
[1:36:35] enemy emboldened their commission. And
[1:36:39] it went from just persevering, from just
[1:36:41] being willing to show up and being
[1:36:43] willing to suit your armor uh uh uh s
[1:36:46] sew it up and to and to sharpen your
[1:36:48] sword and to stand there into action.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Of what value is the message of the hour
[1:36:58] if we don't live it?
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; If we don't walk with the Lord Jesus
[1:37:02] Christ.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Of what value is it just to look at it
[1:37:05] on a shelf? if it isn't in you and it
[1:37:08] isn't in me because the message of the
[1:37:10] hour is Christ in you the hope of glory.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; It is a voice out of heaven calling to
[1:37:16] you in this day and it has given you a
[1:37:18] commission that greater is he that's in
[1:37:20] you than he that is in the world. And
[1:37:22] the same spirit that is in you will
[1:37:24] quicken your mortal body that was in
[1:37:27] Christ that quickened his.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; And as A RESULT OF THAT LIFE that is now
[1:37:32] on the inside of you which makes you a
[1:37:34] message believer. It's the life of God.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; It's not a a convincing into a set of
[1:37:39] doctrine.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; But when we are in it and we do have a
[1:37:42] revelation, doctrine becomes clear.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Or at least it should.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And when you are there, the commission
[1:37:50] becomes clear that I can I can rise up.
[1:37:55] I can I can live out my God-given
[1:37:57] obligation to act upon the revealed word
[1:38:01] of the hour. Yeah.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; So, young people and old. This is
[1:38:04] irrespective of age because there was a
[1:38:07] lot of different age groups in that in
[1:38:08] that uh army right there. There's a lot
[1:38:10] of different people. And you old who are
[1:38:13] here, you might say, "Well, I've done
[1:38:14] I've fought too many battles and things
[1:38:16] like that." You need to be emboldened
[1:38:18] like Caleb to pick up a stone and start
[1:38:21] sharpening your sword and say, "I'm not
[1:38:24] done yet.
[1:38:25] I'm going to persevere because I've got
[1:38:27] a commission. And there was a generation
[1:38:29] coming up behind me and I will
[1:38:31] persevere. The enemy will not hold me.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed at the amount of um uh uh in
[1:38:36] the older generation who allow
[1:38:38] themselves to be crippled by fear.
[1:38:41] Knowing full well what it is, that it is
[1:38:44] a valless element. It has no substance
[1:38:46] to it.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; There is no fruit to fear.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; It is valless. There's nothing to it. It
[1:38:52] may or may not happen. There is value to
[1:38:55] faith. It is substance. It is the
[1:38:58] evidence.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And when you, regardless of your age,
[1:39:01] stand on faith, the revelation of the
[1:39:04] revealed word of the hour, AND THEN
[1:39:06] PERSEVERE WITHIN YOUR COMMISSION.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Then God can do mighty things in our
[1:39:13] midst.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; To you young people, it's the exact same
[1:39:17] thing. When you meet the Lord Jesus
[1:39:19] Christ in a new birth and a when you
[1:39:22] meet him and and however the Lord does
[1:39:25] that in your life, whatever your story
[1:39:27] looks like, but one thing was always
[1:39:29] certain in the book of Acts, he came to
[1:39:32] you. Brother Bannon was very clear. You
[1:39:34] don't get the Holy Ghost, he gets you.
[1:39:36] And when you have that revelation of who
[1:39:40] he is to you, then now you can begin to
[1:39:43] persevere. You place your faith on the
[1:39:46] word of God and you begin to walk
[1:39:49] forward in your commission
[1:39:52] to obey it, to speak the revealed word
[1:39:54] of the hour, to walk in it.
[1:39:59] I believe with all my heart
[1:40:03] the message of the hour did not come to
[1:40:05] decorate us
[1:40:07] like the Catholic Church and robes and
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; pretty buildings and
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; all of those things.
[1:40:15] The message of the hour is the person of
[1:40:17] the Lord Jesus Christ in you
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; that one day will quicken your mortal
[1:40:22] body from this life to the next. He will
[1:40:24] change you in the moment of a twinkling
[1:40:25] of an eye. But until then,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I will live assuredly.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; I will live in the strength of who he is
[1:40:35] in me.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; In his strength,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; I will handle whatever situation comes
[1:40:41] my way as effectively as I can. I will
[1:40:44] be the best uh husband, wife, father,
[1:40:47] mother, grandparent
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; that I can possibly be. I will live
[1:40:54] intentionally.
[1:40:56] understanding that the enemy is fleeing
[1:40:57] before me.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; So I will not live as a soldier on the
[1:41:01] ridge line suited up.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I will step down into the valley.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Understanding that Christ has already
[1:41:08] made a way for you to live victoriously.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; So what have we to fear?
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; What have we to dread?
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; We are really leaning on the everlasting
[1:41:20] arms of almighty God.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So I challenge you and
[1:41:25] I ask you, are you a soldier that's just
[1:41:28] standing on the ridge line in the
[1:41:30] promised land, having possessed the
[1:41:32] land, suited up, but you're not willing
[1:41:35] to go out and say, "You know what?
[1:41:38] I can be a better father."
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; I can I can be I can be a better mother.
[1:41:44] I I I want to know what that even looks
[1:41:46] like.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Because from my life, I don't know what
[1:41:49] that looks like.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; I'm all messed up.
[1:41:52] And so by the by the power of the
[1:41:55] resurrection
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; and in my land, the enemy will not wreak
[1:41:59] havoc in my family.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; And if when the enemy does come and
[1:42:05] difficulties and failures happen,
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; I will get back up
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; and I will continue to pursue the enemy.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Because failure is not final.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; We fight the battles. We fight the the
[1:42:19] difficulties. We go through them.
[1:42:22] We've already won the war.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; So I I look at I look at this
[1:42:32] and I look at what the Apostle Paul was
[1:42:34] telling this group of not rebellious
[1:42:36] people but weary people. And I don't
[1:42:40] know where you are today.
[1:42:42] I don't know if you uh maybe maybe you
[1:42:44] do have doubts about the message. I
[1:42:46] don't know.
[1:42:48] Maybe you are weary in in just
[1:42:51] the continuence, the perseverance.
[1:42:55] And Paul says to you,
[1:42:59] "Cast not away therefore your
[1:43:01] confidence."
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; We are not that draw back under
[1:43:06] predition.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; That's the enemy's lie.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; But for us to be able to genuinely say,
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; "Satan, get thee behind me.
[1:43:16] I am I am of them that believe
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; to the saving of the soul
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; and I am getting off this ridge line of
[1:43:24] inactivity and I am going to go down and
[1:43:27] I am going to carry out the message of
[1:43:28] the hour in my life.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to live as
[1:43:32] effectively as I can enjoy the process
[1:43:35] that the Lord brings me through and I'm
[1:43:37] going to go live like a a person that
[1:43:40] Christ has changed and passed from death
[1:43:42] unto life.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to claim my mountain.
[1:43:46] I'm going to claim my victory that
[1:43:48] you've already made possible.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Would you bow your heads with me? I want
[1:43:57] to stop right there
[1:44:04] as the musicians come.
[1:44:11] And just in the stillness of his
[1:44:13] presence
[1:44:15] and
[1:44:17] in in just the quiet place that you are,
[1:44:27] I I want you and I want to I want to
[1:44:29] pray with you
[1:44:33] that
[1:44:36] just wherever you you may be in your
[1:44:39] life,
[1:44:42] a person standing on the ridge line.
[1:44:45] Maybe you've been there for many, many
[1:44:47] years.
[1:44:50] Um, maybe you're a young person and you
[1:44:53] feel like you're there right now.
[1:44:57] The Lord has already made a way
[1:45:00] for us to endure, for us to steadfastly
[1:45:04] persevere. He has already
[1:45:07] enabled us to have patience.
[1:45:10] And
[1:45:13] it is it is for us
[1:45:15] to rise up as
[1:45:19] the me as the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:45:23] and to live out the commission
[1:45:27] to walk it out
[1:45:31] to stand in our God-given obligation to
[1:45:35] act upon the revealed word of the hour.
[1:45:40] not to sherk back from it, not to sit
[1:45:42] and say, "Well, maybe that's not true or
[1:45:43] maybe this is not true." Seek out the
[1:45:45] answer, find the answer, and stand there
[1:45:49] in that revelation that God will give
[1:45:51] you. SEEK AND YE SHALL FIND.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; It is not a hope. So, it is a promise of
[1:45:58] the Lord Jesus Christ. So, if you are
[1:46:00] there, seek because you will find.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; It may not come like you want it. It may
[1:46:06] not be the answer that you expect. very
[1:46:09] rarely is it is but that it is he will
[1:46:12] give it to you.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; And when you have that, you can
[1:46:17] persevere in that. If you know where you
[1:46:21] are today, you say, "I know that I'm a
[1:46:23] son and daughter of God. I've gone
[1:46:25] through I've got a really scratched up
[1:46:27] shield and a dented sword,
[1:46:30] but I stand firm in that in that
[1:46:32] revelation that he gave me. And as a
[1:46:36] result, I will persevere and I will walk
[1:46:38] out my commission. I will step down off
[1:46:41] of this ridge line and I will continue
[1:46:43] running after that enemy that is fleeing
[1:46:45] before my face. The enemy has no hold on
[1:46:48] you.
[1:46:50] He does not have to have a hold on you.
[1:46:57] Come boldly before the throne of grace.
[1:47:01] allow him to work in the very deep
[1:47:04] places
[1:47:06] and say, "Lord, I don't want to be a
[1:47:08] ridge line believer. I want to get down
[1:47:12] off of this ridge line.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[1:47:17] I raise my hand.
[1:47:21] I want that.
[1:47:23] I want to recognize my conqueror has
[1:47:26] done the deed. Goliath is defeated
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; and me standing on that ridge line
[1:47:33] looking down. May you embolden my
[1:47:35] commission.
[1:47:38] May I not weary in this perseverance.
[1:47:41] May I have confidence, Lord.
[1:47:44] May my confidence not be shaken.
[1:47:47] May my confidence not be uh um cast
[1:47:50] away.
[1:47:53] But Lord, may you strengthen me.
[1:47:56] I pray that for everyone in this room.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; I pray that Lord that you would bless
[1:48:01] them every heart
[1:48:05] that you would embolden them Lord in
[1:48:07] where they stand.
[1:48:12] Oh Lord, I pray that you would just move
[1:48:14] among our hearts this morning. May we
[1:48:17] stand strong.
[1:48:19] May we stand firm.
[1:48:23] I love what brother Brandham said.
[1:48:26] down with Satan and his gloom and up
[1:48:30] with the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:48:34] May that be our prayer this morning. May
[1:48:36] that be our heart's cry. Away with Satan
[1:48:40] and his gloom

[1:50:13] how great
[1:50:15] is our God.
[1:50:19] Sing this.
[1:50:24] He says,
[1:50:27] "Oh, when time is in his hands, the
[1:50:33] beginning, the end,
[1:50:36] the end.
[1:50:40] God,

[1:51:25] through an open book in Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:31] The son of man

[1:51:41] has come.

[1:52:06] Oh, see how great
[1:52:09] you are. Great
[1:52:13] God.

[1:52:31] will sing

[1:52:53] And my heart will sing. How great
[1:52:58] is our God?
[1:53:05] How great
[1:53:07] is our God?
[1:53:10] Sing with me. How great
[1:53:13] is our God.
[1:53:16] Sing how great
[1:53:19] how great
[1:53:22] is our God.
[1:53:26] Amen. Praise the Lord. I wonder if we
[1:53:29] could sing that song. You were singing
[1:53:31] it uh before.
[1:53:34] And uh I just love it so much. And if
[1:53:38] you want, it's rising up. And if you
[1:53:40] want prayer, I'll be happy to pray with
[1:53:42] you. But I just I just feel like singing
[1:53:44] this song
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; because I look at that and I I I don't
[1:53:47] feel
[1:53:49] woe is me. I look at that story and I
[1:53:52] place myself in the Israelites seat and
[1:53:55] the enemy running and me running after
[1:53:57] them and I think
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; I'm excited.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; I'm excited to be a Christian.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; I have problems, too.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; I'll deal with them.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; I'll handle my problems, but I'm excited
[1:54:10] to be a Christian.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; I'll face my inequalities. I'll face
[1:54:15] what I am doing wrong. I'll own up to
[1:54:17] it. I'll live with accountability in the
[1:54:19] principles of the scripture.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; I'll be the best husband I can be and
[1:54:24] really try to understand what that
[1:54:26] means. I'll try to be the best pastor I
[1:54:28] can be. But I'm excited to be a
[1:54:30] Christian.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song.
[1:54:34] Rulers of across the land. See God's
[1:54:38] mighty hand.
[1:54:46] Oh my go.
[1:55:00] Rising up
[1:55:03] the message. Rising up.
[1:55:08] Rising up.
[1:55:11] Rising up
[1:55:14] the New Testament church. Rising up.
[1:55:22] Holy Ghost fell.
[1:55:25] Wonders were on by Apostle J.
[1:55:31] Spirits were cast out.
[1:55:34] They sing and shout
[1:55:37] by God's holy angel
[1:55:48] church. Rising up.
[1:55:52] Rising up.
[1:55:54] Rising up.
[1:56:03] is all
[1:56:06] miracles are done. I have some good news
[1:56:10] bringing you
[1:56:13] in
[1:56:24] right now.
[1:56:26] Rising up
[1:56:29] for the New Testament church rising up.
[1:56:34] Rising up.
[1:56:37] Rising up.
[1:56:39] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:56:42] up.
[1:56:45] Hallelujah. Just go ahead and keep
[1:56:47] playing it
[1:56:49] because I believe God is doing things
[1:56:51] here.
[1:56:53] I believe he's speaking to hearts and he
[1:56:56] spoke to you this morning. You've been
[1:56:58] on a ridge line too long.
[1:57:00] You've been looking at the complexities
[1:57:02] of your life or your career or your job
[1:57:06] or whatever the complexity of this
[1:57:09] Goliath that has stood up. Understand
[1:57:11] here were the armies ready for battle.
[1:57:14] Brother Brennham said God didn't call
[1:57:16] you to a picnic. He's called you to a
[1:57:19] battle.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And he's given you the
[1:57:23] armor. He's given you the weaponry
[1:57:27] to enter into the battle.
[1:57:30] So we don't stand there and we just
[1:57:33] observe because there will be Goliaths
[1:57:35] that come in your life. There will be
[1:57:38] obstacles that will impede your going
[1:57:41] forward which will hinder you from
[1:57:45] TAKING WHAT IS YOURS.
[1:57:49] And tonight you've or this morning you
[1:57:51] have very very clearly seen
[1:57:55] that you've got to quit observing.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; I've been on a ridge line of this
[1:58:02] message
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; and of the word OF GOD IN MY LIFE and I
[1:58:06] YEAH I'M CALLED TO A BATTLE BUT HOW DO I
[1:58:10] GET INTO IT?
[1:58:12] will understand your captain has gone
[1:58:16] before you.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "Greater is he that is in you
[1:58:21] than he that's in the world." He just
[1:58:23] didn't say, "Okay, boys, go get them."
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Your captain said, "Come on, follow me,
[1:58:30] boys."
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT REAL FAITH does
[1:58:36] gets off the ridge line
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; and gets into action. And I think
[1:58:41] there's some of you that have you've
[1:58:43] been playing around.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; You've let whatever hindrance it is that
[1:58:50] stands before you and you've halted in
[1:58:54] your experience.
[1:58:56] I believe that this sermon has stirred
[1:58:59] hearts. I know it stirred me. So if it's
[1:59:03] stirred you,
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to say, "I will get off of
[1:59:10] this ridge line.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Get away from the complexities that have
[1:59:15] hindered me, and I will now enter into
[1:59:18] the valley of the battle. And though I
[1:59:20] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:59:23] death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
[1:59:27] with me."
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:34] WHEN THE HEAD RISES, the body rises with
[1:59:38] it. That's why when David cut the head
[1:59:41] off, Goliath will never rise again.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; That's why,
[1:59:47] my God.
[1:59:50] When you go into battle and you cut that
[1:59:53] head off, it'll never rise again.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; There's only one that's going to rise.
[1:59:58] That's the resurrection.
[2:00:01] That's he who's got it. He says, "Though
[2:00:04] I was dead, I'm alive forever more.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; And I am the resurrection and I am the
[2:00:10] life and I will give you the victory."
[2:00:13] So, I think it's time. And I I tell you
[2:00:16] what, I just think there should be more
[2:00:18] people coming here right now saying,
[2:00:19] "You know what? I want to I want to
[2:00:22] come. I I want to show myself. I want to
[2:00:24] get off the red ridge line. I I want to
[2:00:27] come. I I just want to show I'm part of
[2:00:30] those that I want to get into this
[2:00:32] battle.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; As I look out across the land,
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Is anyone else
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; you'd like to say? I'm going to get off
[2:00:58] that ridge line. Come on now.
[2:01:12] New Testament church rising.
[2:01:16] I'm rising up.
[2:01:19] Rising up
[2:01:22] the New Testament church. Rising up.
[2:01:29] James,
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; yes.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Come on up here. We want to pray for
[2:01:38] these people. Holy
[2:01:46] angels.
[2:01:52] I know.
[2:01:57] I know.
[2:01:59] I know.
[2:02:02] I know.
[2:02:09] Hallelujah.
[2:02:13] Mirales are done.
[2:02:16] The good news bring you
[2:02:20] in the last days.
[2:02:23] The spirit
[2:02:27] will be well renewed. I love
[2:02:34] my
[2:02:53] Psalms 34. This poor man cried. This
[2:02:56] poor man cried this morning. You got a
[2:02:58] need, come forward.
[2:03:01] I saw the Lord
[2:03:05] and he answered me
[2:03:09] and delivered me
[2:03:13] from everything. That's what he does
[2:03:18] on
[2:03:21] our radian.
[2:03:25] They'll never be ashamed.

[2:12:51] morning. Sometimes I fall.
[2:13:03] Oh my Jesus.

[2:13:13] Oh, sometimes I feel
[2:13:19] that I'm glory.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; This is what he preached this morning.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:34] Oh, come Jesus.
[2:13:39] You've been waiting so long
[2:13:44] for the day you return to heal every
[2:13:49] hurt and write every wrong.
[2:13:55] We need you right now.
[2:13:59] Oh, come and turn this around.
[2:14:05] Oh, now I go. This world is in
[2:14:11] Jesus.
[2:14:15] Come Jesus.
[2:14:19] Second verse. There'll be no more
[2:14:26] be.
[2:14:30] Holy Jesus comes
[2:14:35] and today
[2:14:38] is who he comes for. He'll come for the
[2:14:42] we

[2:14:50] and all.
[2:14:54] Do you believe the power of his name?
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Come Jesus come.
[2:15:00] Come Jesus come.
[2:15:05] We've been waiting so long
[2:15:10] for the day you'll return to heal every
[2:15:17] heart.
[2:15:20] Oh, we need you right now.
[2:15:26] is around
[2:15:33] world is
[2:15:36] Jesus.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:48] Wonderful. Wonderful.
[2:15:52] And I just feel a strange moving of the
[2:15:54] Holy Spirit right now.
[2:15:57] I'd like you to just keep your heads
[2:15:59] bowed for just a moment.
[2:16:04] You know, I don't do this often,
[2:16:07] but when the opportunity comes, I want
[2:16:09] to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit.
[2:16:14] And it wasn't necessary for you to come
[2:16:16] down here to actually be prayed for, but
[2:16:20] it is necessary
[2:16:22] for you to get off the ridge line
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; and get into the battle.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; It's not that you need us to pray for
[2:16:30] you to even walk down here, but it does
[2:16:34] take a willing heart.
[2:16:37] And if this message stirred your heart
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; to want to be better,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; would you raise your hand? Say, "Thank
[2:16:45] you." And right now at the altar of my
[2:16:48] heart,
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; that's what I want. I just want to be
[2:16:53] better.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; I want to fight a good fight.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want Loudiusa to overcome me,
[2:17:01] but I want to overcome Laudi.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And right now I'm responding
[2:17:08] to this. I'm responding and I'm saying I
[2:17:12] realize I can't do it. It's not my by my
[2:17:15] power, by my might, but it's by your
[2:17:18] spirit, sayeth the Lord.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; So, Father God, you see every hand, both
[2:17:22] of my hands are raised up.
[2:17:25] Because Father, I realize that in this
[2:17:28] age of complexities and all the
[2:17:32] diversities and whatever Goliath and
[2:17:34] whatever stands in the valley that
[2:17:37] impedes your progress to take that land
[2:17:40] that belongs to you, it's your
[2:17:43] inheritance.
[2:17:45] I pray that you will rise up right now
[2:17:48] and say, "I claim this inheritance. It
[2:17:52] is mine. It is my rightful position as a
[2:17:56] believer and I want to claim every
[2:17:59] promise
[2:18:02] unto me. I will not pass it off to
[2:18:05] someone else.
[2:18:08] The promise only came to Mary to quicken
[2:18:11] her when she said, "Be it unto me
[2:18:16] according to thy word." So we say those
[2:18:19] words, be it unto me
[2:18:22] according to thy word.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Quicken
[2:18:28] the life of Christ in every believer.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; Yes indeed.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; It's not rules, regulations. It is not
[2:18:35] standards. It is not commandments.
[2:18:38] It is a relationship between you and
[2:18:40] God.
[2:18:42] strengthen therefore that relationship,
[2:18:44] Lord, as we pour our hearts out before
[2:18:47] you. I thank you. Thank you for brother
[2:18:50] Steve, Lord, for putting this on his
[2:18:52] heart, Father, to take a simple thought
[2:18:57] but very profound.
[2:18:59] How that they were there, they were
[2:19:02] persevering, they were looking what's
[2:19:05] going to happen.
[2:19:07] I pray that each one of us will not be
[2:19:10] one of those that just stand and watches
[2:19:14] but now gets into the battle and is
[2:19:17] ready to go after because our Christ has
[2:19:20] already entered and defeated our enemy.
[2:19:23] Therefore, we have a right to possess
[2:19:26] every gate to claim every promise.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; We ask these things for your glory
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:19:38] Amen.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. I know when God moves and I
[2:19:48] know he moves in very special ways.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I love
[2:19:57] I love as a minister, as an elder within
[2:19:59] the message, see a young man standing
[2:20:02] there with confidence.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Speaking truth
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; and confidence breeds confidence. Faith
[2:20:12] breeds faith.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; And add unto your faith virtue, and to
[2:20:17] your virtue, knowledge, and to knowledge
[2:20:19] temperance.
[2:20:21] God is building you to be a powerhouse
[2:20:24] for the living God.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; And he's doing it. It is Christ in you.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; It is Christ in you.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; All you have to do
[2:20:40] is believe.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; That's what believers do.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Is they believe.
[2:20:53] Brother Brandham given a commission
[2:20:57] go into the whole world preach the
[2:20:58] gospel. I'm going to give you two signs
[2:21:00] as Moses given two signs.
[2:21:04] And I want you to heal the sick and do
[2:21:06] the discernment. But that's only the
[2:21:09] attraction.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be a voice
[2:21:11] behind the sign.
[2:21:16] That's right.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; And if you'll get the people to believe,
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; has he gotten you to believe?
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm not that great
[2:21:28] warrior. I'm not that great." Hey,
[2:21:32] the greatness is him.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; David told Goliath, "You come to me with
[2:21:41] spear and shield. You're a man of war
[2:21:44] war, but I come to you in the name of
[2:21:46] the Lord Jesus.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord God of Israel, I
[2:21:50] come. That's where how and that's how
[2:21:52] you should quit looking at you. Well, I
[2:21:55] I'm not strong enough. Of course, you're
[2:21:56] not. You can't do it.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; And when you finally accept the fact
[2:22:01] it's not me, it's him.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Then let him
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; take control.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you what, what a lovely,
[2:22:12] lovely, lovely service.
[2:22:15] Amen. And if you've never accepted Jesus
[2:22:19] Christ as your personal Lord and Savior,
[2:22:23] why don't you do it now?
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; If you are afraid of failure, you'll
[2:22:32] never get out of the boat.
[2:22:37] I tell you
[2:22:40] all you have to do. He says, "Come unto
[2:22:43] me all ye that are weary and are heavy
[2:22:45] laden and I will give you rest. Take my
[2:22:48] yoke upon you for my yoke is easy
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; and my burden is light.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Seek and ye shall find. Ask and it shall
[2:23:00] be given. Knock
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; and the door shall be open."
[2:23:04] That's all you got to do.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes.
[2:23:09] We're going to just sing this song.
[2:23:12] We're going to be dismissed. And Amen.

[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
