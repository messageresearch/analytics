somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I saw that when we were trying to command our body some of you don't have command of your body you don't your hands they don't command what you're telling it your feet they're immobile so I think that you should have command of it anyway praise the Lord amen that's not a reprimand that's just provoking you under good works amen God bless you all this evening um it's just a pleasure to be here this evening with all of you this is a youth service although we have allowed I told the church that uh if the parents want to come or the the whole church wants to come I think everybody you know um should be here and and pulling uh that our young people will get under that atmosphere in a place where God can do something with them I mean do you know most of the disciples were called between 18 and 22 years of age think of that 18 to 22 years of age that's right about how many here are between 18 and 22 how about any of the you guys some of you 18 and 22 think of that God is good though amen uh we landed back in h Phoenix yesterday morning about 9:30 our son picked us up took us to uh to a little breakfast uh at Carolin they had a burrito I seem to always want to have Mexican food when when I come home I told him it'd be good to have a little burrito anyway we got home 9:30 uh our flight was delayed an actual 12 hours uh from the original flight plan so instead of leaving 10:00 at night in Johannesburg it left the next morning so instead of getting there and getting on the plane and getting a little something to eat and and then because the first flight 17 hours that's 17 hours sitting on an airplane for an old guy that's not easy and uh so you're you're still awake it's you know you don't feel like going to sleep till uh the plan starting to land and uh anyway last night Sandy and I I said I we got to stay up as long as we can you know try to drop in the time zone 9:00 her and I looking at one another and we're both falling asleep I said man honey I got to go to bed so tonight I'm still a little bit on the jet lag uh issue and so it's a little bit of a problem I told him I am not gonna sit up here and I'm not gonna let them put the camera on me should I start to KN out because it's not easy and if any of you have ever traveled internationally you know what we're talking about God bless you I am excited I I we have brother Daniel Andes his wife sister Shannon are here and we've directed this service towards the youth I pray that what you will be doing is listening intently because I believe that God has got something for you when you have a man of God and he waits before the Lord and He seeks the mind of God that God would come and speak to you so this is directed towards you and so I pray that each one of you will be there attentive receptive and and listening intently what the spirit is going to say to to your heart so I'll turn it back to Jonathan he can sing another song I'm

it I know it was the blood you know that song I know it was the blood I tell you what if you're any type of a Christian you know it was the blood of Jesus Christ that cleansed you of your sin all of us are born into the world with sin and it takes the blood of Jesus Christ but I tell you I've never met anything that's more powerful than the blood let's sing it together I know it was the blood I

I know it was a blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross oh I know it was the blood for me amen God is good amen if you have your Bibles I want to turn several different places I bring you greetings from the church back home brother Brad Burgess Church there we're in Jeffersonville now the Lord bless us we moved from Louisville to Indiana I bring greetings from the church there I just want to say what an honor it is to be with you here brother Ron amen and sister Sandy we had a little coffee this afternoon and it was wonderful to be with friends amen we go way way back and I see so many of my friends here tonight good to see the ones from up in Flagstaff God bless you I know you've made a great sacrifice to be here and I start mentioning names brother Mark stanky he was at my wedding many many years ago brother Russell amen lots of memories and it just seems like the Lord's intertwined our lives together amen that's for a reason God puts people in your life for a reason amen and they point you one or two ways either closer to the Lord Jesus or away from the Lord Jesus and I was thinking about that today how that you know when you come together uh you know it's good to have a purpose a lot of people don't have a purpose and I think it's tonight you all have set aside time it's Friday night you I mean I don't think anybody's here because you didn't have anything to do we all have things to do and things we want to do but so I found in life unless you stay very focused there's many distractions so like if you were going to go out and cut wood and all of a sudden the F-16 fighter planes go over your neighbor Lo their dog gets loose and runs by or the flowers bloom and you get distracted you never cut the wood and that's the same with going to church you have to have a purpose and then and if if you don't have that purpose and stay focused on that purpose you'll get distracted so you must Define your purpose our purpose is to draw closer to the Lord Jesus Christ how many would raise their hand and say I've got a purpose in being here now if you'll hold that purpose there's many things to distract you like you know that second song they sang it was just like one um key too high and the second verse they didn't say that word just right musicians will get OCD over that stuff and they'll just get or somebody's sitting over here and and you get distracted by that pretty young man or that you know handsome young man or pretty girl you know and you get but you have to just stay focused sometimes when I people are preaching I'm on the edge of my seat because I just want to listen to what they say because there's so many distractions in this life there's so many how many can say Amen there are so many distractions of social media and the internet and so many things but tonight we just want to have a purpose I want to draw closer to the Lord amen let's just pray together Heavenly Father Lord we love you today Lord we come with singleness of mind to draw closer to you father it's such a blessing to see so many that have been serving you for so many years Lord standing and Lord proving that you're the same yesterday today and forever and if we'll surrender our hearts to you you'll make us pillars in the house of God may you strengthen us tonight Lord as we read your word I pray for every young man that's here and every young woman Lord as it's a a a youth service so to speak but father I pray that the Holy Spirit would come Among Us in a special way Lord you know the time and the study and the prayer that's gone into the few words that we will say and I pray God that the you would anoint the words father they would just not be dry words but the holy spirit will come behind the words Lord and I think of those that have traveled miles to come to this service and I pray God when they drive home that they'll say did not our hearts burn within us when the Holy Spirit was speaking to us in a real way I pray you'd bless the word of God now and strengthen Us in the name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen amen I want to speak a thought tonight of a word from the Lord a word from the Lord I want to read several scriptures the first one I want to read in Matthew 4:4 amen it's good to have a Bible if you don't have a Bible I'm going to encourage you this is a youth service to get you a Bible if you don't have one I'm going to volunteer brother Ron because in the back office he tried to give me one so if you don't have a Bible brother Ron's got one he'll give to you amen so you should have a Bible and you should have it marked up with many scriptures we're going to go through some scriptures today that are so powerful and you should have a Bible and it becomes a part of you in your life and you mark in there and then you go back and have devotions and it means something to you amen Matthew the 4th chapter verse number four we're just going to jump into these chapters and read these verses and then speak tonight Matthew 4:4 and he answered and said said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's in red that mean Jesus Christ spoke it right we can't live by bread alone but we got to live by the words of God Hebrews chapter 4 this is out of the Bible right if I don't read it right you let me know because amen we got to live by this book and I got news for you I didn't write the book somebody else wrote the book it's kind of like a test Jesus said the word that I've spoken going to you it'll judge you in the last day it's kind of like an open book test here's the book go ahead and judge yourself so we won't be condemned at the end Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piecing even piercing even to the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do now our thought tonight is a word from the Lord and the Bible says if you do receive a word from the Lord in verse 12 it is quick and it is powerful so many times people come to church and they don't expect anything and they leave and they don't get anything you have to expect something that's my thought tonight is I want a word from the Lord how many would say that I would like to have a word from the Lord spoken to me now this is the Bible and I'm not going to sit here and read you every part of the Bible but there's some part of in here tonight that I believe God will speak to us and everyone need God to speak to us in our lives amen we need the Lord Jesus 2 Timothy chapter 3 2 Timothy chapter 3:1 16 all scripture now we know that the scripture is the word of God so all of the word of God is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen may God add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak tonight about a word from the Lord you know it's something to just hear words but it's something else when God begins to speak to you you and when God begins to speak to you it takes men that are lost and are trying to find their way but when God speaks to them they know who they are Moses was told his whole life that he was the deliverer you might have been SE here and somebody told you your whole life that the message is true and Moses thought in his mind about what his mother had told him you're the deliverer and he lived his life and some things happened in his life he did some things that are wrong is this okay he did some things that he thought was right but it didn't go well maybe he had a problem in the church or his family and he just walked away from it all he said I'm kind of done with all of this and he fled to a way somewhere he got married started another career had some children but God knew where he was and God came looking for him and there's something about children of God God knows where you are and he knows how to find you yes sir and when he received a word from the Lord something Supernatural started happening and he he was a scientist brother Ram tells us that he could teach the musician you the the the the the elders in in Israel in in Egypt but he saw a bush that was burning but he noticed that the leaves did not it didn't consume and he said I think I'll turn aside and see this thing that's speaking to me and in the supernal god began to speak to him out of the Bush and he spoke back to it in fact brother br says in the message why Christ speak no man no woman no church will ever have a foundation stand until they speak to that light and it speaks back to them and God has a way of speaking God has a voice do you believe that today now God is a spirit we have five senses C taste F smell and here in the Pentecostal Realms they sought God to speak to them and they would feel it or they would here and brother Ram tells us he said those five senses weren't given to you to contact God they were given you to contact your Earthly realm but there's another sense called faith that reaches to God and he that cometh to God must believe you must believe there is a God Amen so he that cometh to God must believe how many believe there's a God now that's why the atheists there's been many people believe that that deny God there's been very few that have di died atheist because God has a way to call a man to judgment before he dies so I was going out of this restaurant the other day and I he there was a man there he said you've been to church and or you preached at church and I it kind of caught me off guard I said yes are you and then I said are you a Christian he turned and walked out the door he said no I'm an atheist and of course I had to follow him out the door his wife's like no I'm like no no hey wait wait there's been a lot of people live at atheist but not very many die as an atheist when you're breathing that last breath and you realize you have to go somewhere and you have to meet God and it's the grace of God that God would speak to someone there's many people amen I'll just say this the angels that were in heaven for millions of years their whole job was to cry holy holy holy holy holy and we know the story they send brother Ron against God Lucifer and he and he was cast out and the Angels were cast out with him there isn't one scripture in the Bible that says that God ever reached down and tried to reconcile those angels back to him listen to me but when his son Adam made a mistake then God came looking for his son and God began to call his name Adam Adam where are you oh if we could ever hear the voice of God call our Nam so many people go to church and they get caught in this what I call herd mentality or herd therapy and we we don't need that we need God that will speak to us amen that's what Moses did he he separated and he said I'll turn aside and we need to turn aside from the routine of life to let a supernatural God speak to us I was thinking of Jacob he had everything but then Esau had all caught up with him and there's a time you know you might sin and do this but the Bible says the soul that sinth will surely die there's another verse that says be sure your sins will find you out we have an ex-president is caught in a lot of legal suit suits because the Bible is true and it said be sure your sins will find you out someday it will catch up with you you might cover it in this life but there's a great judgment that'll catch up with this and judgment begins at the house of God and it's the mercy of God that God would ever speak to us I when God speak to us I just want to say Lord here am I I'm right here Lord I was thinking about this how that the scripture says the word of God a word from the Lord is quick and powerful and I just because sometimes it's just one word I was thinking there in Matthew the thir chapter how that the word came to to John the Baptist and it was just the word repent and he just went and started preaching repentance and preached repentance and people didn't like the word of the Lord Brother Ronnie they went out there to hear the message of the hour and here's a man in camel skins and man he had a beard honey dripping off his beard Maybe at w Locust and honey and Locust maybe one of the Locust wings were hanging in the honey and it's like ah ah and he's just screaming repent repent and then the religious people come out he said no you need to go bring forth fruits meat for repentance you stand in the mud so sometimes when God speak to you it's not the way you want it and here's what happens is people throw the message out with the messenger because the messenger looks a certain way but I'm here to tell you the truth is the truth no matter who speaks it the truth is the truth no matter who speaks it you may not like me you say brother Daniel your nose is crooked if you know me I've showed the scar that I got on my arm when I made a mistake back in my life so I have a lot of but if God uses me to speak to you don't worry about the messenger just listen to the message and they failed in John's day because they refused the message because of the messenger but the word of God came as one word repent I thought about Legion we know the story Jesus has just fed 5,000 they get in the boats they cross over and they come to gadera and there was a maniac that was there and brother Ram tells the story uh you can listen to the story how he tells the story said it was a man had a nice family wife and then he said he got to hanging around with the wrong people and was out with somebody and he he took a drink and he said he picked up his first devil said he went home and his wife said where you been d d said well I was just out he told a lie he said he picked up his second devil and after a while he picked up he was called Legion which means a thousand pretty soon he had a thousand demons that were encapsulated in this man and the Bible tells us that because of those demons that he took on in his life the Bible says he became homeless we're dealing with cities that are full of homeless people God doesn't want you to be like that David said I was once young now I'm old I've never seen the righteous forsaken I've never seen the the his seed begging for bread because God will take care of you there's something about being a child of God that God will take care of you some of you young sisters you're looking for security in your life sometimes we look and we look over here at men and people get married and maybe some things happen and they they don't have their security in Christ we need to have our security in Jesus Christ amen and so this man became homeless the Bible says he cut him himself and then there was chains and so we see in that day it was very primitive as we would say but now we see in our day that people they have chains and you know brother R talks about in Africa how that the heathens they stick bones in their nose and their ears and we call them heathens but the science has allowed the Heathen to refine the bones to to metal that is very nice metal that you can put in your nose or earrings or piercing in your bodies and we see from the Bibles that's the nice thing about life you as young people you realize you know we're not the first people to to go through life so we look around at people around us and there's something you can learn a great wisdom there's one thing better than learning from your mistakes is just learn from somebody else's mistakes and when they go down a path that's not right and things happen like look I'm just not going down that path it's kind of like people they get in their mind and they start walking away from the message of William brandom and I'll just tell you this I've never seen one person that's walked away from this message that has gone any place that I want to go that I want my friends to go or I want any of you all to go and I say look I don't need to go there because I see what it doesn't produce people that love Jesus Christ and want to go to church and be full of the Holy Spirit and praying and worshiping God and amen and live a consecrated life but you know in moses' day there was people that withstood Moses in that day and you know what happened the Earth opened up and swallowed them up the Earth is a type of worldliness and you watch people that they criticize the prophet of the day and watch the world open up and just swallow them up in all kinds of things of the can you say Amen of that world and the things of the world I'm going to learn from those people's mistakes I say I'm not going to go there and this man he was naked and he ran to Jesus and he fell down and he the Bible says he cried and he fell down and he worshiped but I want you to remember he wasn't delivered so coming to church and worshiping and crying that's all good I believe in all of that but it takes something more than that it needs it took God to speak to that man and he got a word from the Lord and that word from the Lord was two letters go go and by the power of the word of the Lord applied to his situation a thousand demons left that man can you say Amen to that we know the story and the Bible says later they came back and the man was said he was seated he was clothed and he was in his right mind so when you see the people of world and they're piercing their body they're cutting themselves and they've gone dark and the gothic and the whole thing it's demon powers we see it in the Bible how many can see it in the Bible and we learn from that and we see when Jesus tells those demons to go they're seated they're clothed they're not dressed immorally they're clothed and they're in their right mind I want to be close to Jesus amen I want to have a word from the Lord for me in my life I thought about Eve in Genesis if you have your Bibles Genesis chapter 3 verse number one the Bible says the serpent was was more subtle than any beast of the field he was smart he could talk he was upright of any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest she die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die don't you see how the devil is always coming against the word of the Lord that has been given God gives a word and the Devil Comes against that word of the Lord verse number five for God doth know that in the day that you eat thereof then shall your eyes be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and Satan has come down to destroy the word of the Lord that has been given to us we read the scripture Matthew chapter 4:4 man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God they had an accident in Louisville here a few days ago there was a person driving a semi on the Second Street bridge and a car stopped in front of them and they swerved to avoid the accident you might have seen it in some of the online news and the the semi went off the edge of the bridge the Ohio river flows under it and it went off the bridge and the trailer lodged on the the structure of the the bridge and the cab is just hanging off the side of it in the news they had helicopters and drones out and they're showing it with the live footage and they they come and they were uh Dr brought a um extension ladder from a a fire truck extended and had a man on it and he brought it down such a powerful I'm sitting there looking and getting a thousand sermons you know brother R said your soul hangs over Hell by every word of God said the word of God is a chain it's a chain and little links if you know anything about chains or you have a chain but the chain is only its strongest at its weakest link and your soul is hanging over Hell by every word of God and Satan came and broke in Eve's mind broke the word of God and that's where she fell and that's why we have the sin that's why we have the perversion that we have today because someone had a word from the Lord and they broke the word of the Lord and this person is hanging off it's an amazing thing I took the got some pictures of it and I don't have them here tonight but it was amazing this truck is hanging off and the cab is just hang dangling there and it's hanging way down and so they bring this and they have a man in a harness and he comes down so powerful brother Ron watching this man in the harness and it was so and so the the the cab is hanging off and this man is coming down on a harness and he's reaching out reaching through and saying put this harness on and the thing I observed about this he never allowed himself to be attached to a danger that would destroy him he would never allow himself to get entangled with that truck that could fall at any minute amen good to see you brother Johnson amen that and that's the same with you there's one thing to help people along the way but don't let your life get entangled with those people that when they fall they grab a hold of you and they pull you down and this man was saying you look you put this harness on you separate from sin that's why Bible says come out from among them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord and this man says put on this harness and climb out of there and then he attaches himself to this person and then pulls I say person it was a female driver okay and so they hooked it on it and then they begin to pull them and the whole world's watching and they they pull them uh pull them up and I learned from that don't get your life entangled with other people amen that are going to drag you down and the word from the Lord tonight may be that you need to separate from that person I don't believe in vague words from the Lord I believe God is very specific F and he wants to speak to every one of us the Bible says draw nigh unto God He will draw nigh unto you resist the devil and he'll flee from you Hallelujah my wife and I were studying this morning the verse right above that says submit yourself to God so brother Ron walked out here and said look you know I think we're just getting a little bit uh complacent I'd like everybody over here to move over here and everybody to move over there like I don't want to do that that's just like I don't but if you just submit yourself to that say you know maybe he's right maybe I have just got like girls on this side and guys on this side and it would break something of and he's and that's the thing with the Lord sometimes he submit he speaks to us if you just submit to the spirit of God and you yield to the Holy Spirit whatever he's speaking to you he'll never leave you wrong he will never leave you lead you away from the word of God can you say Amen to that amen he will always lead you to the word of God it's the devil that would ever try to take you you away from the word of God Amen I thought about that story how powerful it is and how that I was thinking of another story my friend tells talking about a word from the Lord and my friend had got in a dark place in his life I think he was came from a separated home and he was on a train in Europe he was going just riding on this train he was just sitting on the train and he just come to the place like my life is not worth living He said I'm dying and so he gets up he goes to the the back of the train brother Jonathan he walks down the steps they have steps and he walked down the steps and open the door and he's standing there it's night time the train is just going and everything and he's just standing there he's ready to step off and directly there was a voice behind him a man said aella aella what are you doing he said he turned around and looked at this man he' never met this man in his life the man didn't know him and God had put that man in his life to come down and call his life back from a life that was about to go to ruin Glory that was a word from the Lord today I text that man and said hey I'm going to use your testimony tonight to speak to some young people that may be sitting at a place that you've come to your last service maybe this is a service you say I'm done this is the last one and then I'm done with this whole thing I was at a service once and a girl come up at the end and she said this was my last service I've come to a place in my life I'm just done with it all and we prayed with her and God changed her life maybe you're that person about to step off and God will send a man into your life that will change your situation if you'll listen to the voice of God I got some notes here and I don't know how to go through them but as the Lord because God has a way to speak brother R said this talking about Christ he might appear to you in the form of your neighbor he might appear appear to you in the form of a minister or your mother Christ appears to you in people he said and as you go along and people appear to you a kind person begins to speak to you listen to them he said you don't know it might be Jesus speaking to you see he appears I'll be with you even in you and as you do unto these you do unto me oh and when you get to looking at it that way the old tradition Falls away see it doesn't become a form of words and Declaration of so many words put together it becomes a living reality that Christ is in us now and the Holy Spirit is moving back and forth through every human being surging through the hearts searching if we would come to church and say I need God to speak to me I need God to speak to me God bless you brother Yi oh how it would change our life we're young people we're sitting here sometimes we come the place of a career I sitting thinking about one of the deacons in our church many years ago we maybe 15 20 years ago we sat in our living room my wife and I was say like I don't know if I should go this direction or I don't know and he made a choice and when you're at those Crossroads I'll say this never make a decision in your life a major decision out of the presence of God I'll say that again never make a major decision in your life outside of the presence of God Amen I'm delivering my heart to you which I believe the Lord has put on my heart through many hours of prayer and seeking the Lord of what I would say to you with just a limited amount of time in a few minutes the musicians will come and they'll play and I'll deliver my message and then you'll be given a package it's like a UPS man he delivers a package to you and he gives it to you now he's given it to you now what are you going to do with it are you going to open that up and are you going to look at it are you going to observe the package the delivery that's and so sometimes we sit and at the end of the service we just kind of wish it would be over but when God delivers a message to you then it's time to just maybe sit down or kneel down and say Lord what am I going to do with this message maybe right now God is speaking to you because God is a spirit he has a voice you don't tell him when to speak he speaks when he wants to speak and he's delivering a message to you right now as you're it's amazing to see young men with the tent of Minds that comes from Christ we see the world the devil wants to take you and hook you on meth or some vaping or you young ladies get you out of your mind and tattoo yourself and Pierce yourself you know you look at the sports guys they tattoo themselves because they want to identify with something bigger than them so a lot of times people are insecure and so they got to go get an identity and like I'm identified with this group or or something some men are so insecure they tattoo mama on their their mama like okay but now the people got all but we as Christians we come into the presence of the Lord like Moses Moses didn't know who he was he didn't know who he was he didn't know who God was but when he walked out of the presence of God he knew who he was he knew who God was and he knew what God wanted him to do oh if we would just wait in the presence of God the other week brother Ron and sister Sandy my wife and are just drinking some coffee and brother Ron was telling experience he just got up in the night he sister Sandy wasn't there is it all right to share this brother Ron it's it's the truth just I love brother Ron sister Sandy I want to share some things on Sunday the powerful impact their life has had on mine and brother Ron said he thought he heard the radio he went in the other room and sister Sandy was there and she was singing in the spirit singing in another language and singing and it was just a beautiful thing he said I was actually a little bit jealous brother Ron the other day we were up at my brother John's and the service was over and people just sitting and worshiping the music playing brother Russell many times we just wait in the presence of God because God speaks Holy Spirit moved on my wife and she was just sitting there singing in another language I don't know what it was but it was the presence of God he's in this room I was I don't know how to preach I've got some notes here but brother random said this he said in this building tonight SS Jesus Christ and this building tonight is host of angels thousands of them gathered around can you imagine me as a minister and these angels are all gathered around if they could speak they'd say Daniel tell them it's real tell them there's another dimension you all can't see it now but there is another dimension that's more real than this dimension in just a few years those that have accepted Christ and been filled with the Holy Spirit are going to be changed they're going to be caught into this Dimension that they can see those angels remember Elisha and Hai like we we don't know they're coming to fight us and he just said Lord open his eyes that he can see this other dimension Oh by faith I can see this Dimension amen Faith cometh by hearing so the Bible says the angels are encamped around about those that fear them brother Ram said you can't see them but you can feel the influence of them do you feel the influence of the angels of God we're not screaming we're not running the aisles but I know that the angels are in this room I know that God God is speaking to Hearts right now it's not even my voice hitting the Anvil and Stirrup of your ear but it's the spirit of God moving out as he cried to Adam Adam where are you where are you tonight and he got Adam's attention he said you can feel them telling you that they are here he said the Bible says that the angels of God are in Camp they don't leave they stay near those that fear Him brother R said wouldn't you like to live where you're conscious of that Unseen World Is Right with you all the time oh I'd like to live there I tell you it'll keep you from sin and keep you from evil in another place brother Ram said those angels are with you and they know your thoughts if you were conscious of that and you knew that they knew your thoughts you I wonder how many times they cover their eyes in in shame because your thoughts are being played to these angels that are with you but if you know that those angels are encamped around you and Christ is with you it makes you walk different makes you talk different it makes you live different not mama and daddy going with us we're growing up and you know parenting you know from the time you're born and you're part of your mother and you start separating uh apart from that you certainly wouldn't want to be 40 and have your mom still driving you to Walmart right or the whatever the the the sports store right you want to you know and so there it parenting is all letting you become independent at the right time you know at at 10 years old you would be reluctant to give a a young man an automatic pistol and say hey just go down there and you know do some target practice in downtown you know no you needed a parent that guides you and leads you and and that's what the holy spirit is there to parent us that's what the Holy Spirit he's a tutor and each one of you need a tutor through life and we have our parents I you know if you have good parents you're blessed it's a Heritage from God some people don't have good Godly Parents and God just Picks Them Up and plucks them out and it's the epitome of the gra of God people that don't even have Christian parents and God just Picks Them Up says you're one of mine but I'll be a father to the fatherless you may be heing you say I never had a father that prayed with me at night but Christ said I will be a father to the fatherless so I never had anybody that loved me well Christ loves you see brother Daniel I don't know which way to turn I tell you you just wait in the presence of God and the Bible says when he the holy spirit is coming he will lead you and he will guide you it doesn't happen in the fast lane of life it doesn't happen on the fast lane of the internet but it comes in the quietness of the Holy Spirit when you're waiting there and say Lord which way should I go Lord I need to hear your voice are you with me tonight is anybody there with me and say Lord I need you to speak to me sometimes we say oh young people yeah they're seeking the Lord for the direction of their life but I can tell you it doesn't matter how old you get you're still praying the same prayer Lord will you lead me will you guide me will you show me which way to turn I don't know if you're young brother Justin and his wife there just got married our sister from Canada one Canadian God brings them together now they've got children I'm sure he's praying the same Lord do I stay at this job do I sing this song Lord I need the leadership of the Holy Ghost brother Russell I mean we're young men once now we're once young now we're you know I'm not old I'm just you know I'm older but I'm youth is trapped in a body but we need God to speak to us you know brother Ron here brother Mark thank you in the back amen we need God to speak to us brother Adam said to realize when you walk out here and get in your cars Angels take their positions by the side of you when you walk up yonder that man so unlovely to you that the holy spirit is standing right Beyond you and angels all around you they don't go back to Heaven they Camp here they Camp there he's talking about with you they're sent on missions to watch you through life's journey you're not all alone if you can get alone to pray I just thoughts come to mind I remember I might have shared this I don't remember one day my father came in my office I worked at the voice of God for Brother Joseph brandham we trying to get the message out to the world my father came in my office said Daniel said there's been a terrible accident and your son's been in a car accident and he has a head injury they don't know how bad it is and you probably should go to the hospital I said which hospital is and he said we we don't know we we we don't know where he's at we just know he's going to the hospital is this okay you give you a few minutes to so I said okay I'll find my son but I need a few time Minutes Alone with God because God knows everything there's no SOS to God there's no emergency he knew before the foundation of the world everything that you would go through and I went in the bathroom this little bitty bathroom at the voice of God and I went there and said Lord I don't know what we're about to go through I don't know what this is all about but you promis you would never leave me and you would never forsake me Lord you go with me you help my son wherever he is then I went to one hospital I just walked pull up the emergency walk through the emergency I know you're not supposed to do that went in all the rooms like where's my they said he's not here I went to another hospital walked all through the rooms I said where's my son they said well they're flying him in with the helicopter I said all right where's the helipad they poin me on the helipad I said they're going to fly him in I said we just stand right here so I stood there and directly somebody came through and it wasn't my son it was somebody else's son and he came through I'm like what happened he said well he's in a car wreck and he hadn't we prayed and God delivered that boy but just the point of you never know when something's going to happen amen I was thinking brother Zachary is he here brother C here but brother Zachary how that we were preaching to brother Ted's I tell the story brother I've told him before how we were leaving church and after the service we come up I thought it was a semi turned over in the road and we got up there it was a F-150 truck turned on the side two uh two vehicles laying on their side and I thought you know what if that was somebody somebody from church and I never asked them if they were right with the Christ you know that's the thing as as ministers it comes with a burden it's not this me too movement like Oh I'm a preacher too I got an iPad I got a Bible I can talk pretty good I'm a preacher I like no it comes the burden of the word comes to an individual and they have a burden in their heart I have a burden for every one of you my first burden is not how good you are at soccer or what your IQ is or what your GPA you know but my my my my burden is are you ready to meet the Lord if we would go and an hour from now we meet you at the intersection you're hanging in your seat belt in that instant one man it was a drunk driver hit man was hanging in his suit in the seat Bel dead and the other person hanging there and we don't know what an hour from from now holds amen but we want to be ready to meet the Lord and my job is to challenge you are you ready to meet the Lord yes sir and what if you would go out and not be ready to meet the Lord I want to know Lord I have done my best to call people to repentance to a real experience with the Lord Jesus Christ that's what it takes a real experience with god brother Wesley it takes men amen that have been on the backside of the desert or wherever your deserted it might be in a park it might be in your car somewhere where God comes and speaks to you and you know that you're a child of God and you confess your sins to him he sends the witness of the Holy Ghost back into your life and confirms to you that your sins are forgiven for given and you know who God is he's a supernatural God and God comes to find you it's not because you were born in a good home I was thankful I was born in a good home and I'm very thankful for that but I had to get lost enough to know that I needed to be saved sometimes we go through and we dress right and we do everything and that's all good but somewhere you have to get lost and realize I need a savior I need God to save me from myself because if God doesn't save me from my myself I'll self-destruct and many times people are given talents in life and it's their talents that actually destroy them Elvis Presley had a great talent to sing and he was very handsome and the the talent that He had actually allowed him to not only be lost but take millions and millions of souls to hell is that all right if I take my coat off You Can't Fight The Devil with the coat on replace the so we see these people and we've been through it before how the these singers most of them were raised in Christian homes and their their inspiration comes from God because Jesus said I the way I'm truth and the life he's inspiration and these people they they get the inspiration of God and they have beautiful maybe even bodies and figures and voices and they go out and the devil takes them and twists them and and takes them to hell and takes millions and millions of souls to hell with them don't be that way turn away from that don't follow somebody to Hell follow somebody to Heaven amen amen Amen brother R said what an atmosphere this is an atmosphere that I wish I could live in Forever this sweet humble feeling what is it what is that how many can say I can feel that sweet humble something in this presence in the room there's not you know hatred is a spirit you've been people are cussing and they're fighting and they're fist fighting that's a spirit but now there's love and there joy and their peace and that's a presence brother Ram said what is that he said it what is it it's the Angels walking up and down the aisles all around these posts around this tent on the outside angels of God are moving their great Wings spread that's what makes you feel that way you didn't feel like this all the time you don't see nothing you're different from when you walked in here a while ago brother Adam said I feel it I'm conscious of it and I want to be conscious of it too and there's something about the presence of God if you've ever been in the presence of God you're conscious when the presence and the spirit of God comes around you how many know what I'm talking about maybe one day you were Bound by some addiction maybe it was alcohol maybe it was drugs maybe it was pornography maybe it was music maybe it was lust maybe it was Pride whatever it was and you realize there was only one thing that you could could deliver you and it was the Holy Ghost and Fire John the Baptist said I'm baptizing you with water but there's one coming after me that will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire and so some people get in the rain and it just rains on him the Holy Ghost just rains on him but John said there's one coming after me Christ he's going to baptize you with a fire of the Holy Ghost that'll burn those desires out of your life they'll burn those evil desires out of your life oh blessed be the name of the Lord there's so many scriptures that come to my mind right now talking about a word from the Lord I think about Peter how he came on the day of Pentecost he preaches the Acts chapter 2 the whole the whole thing and then he comes down um because sometimes a word from the Lord listen to me right here can be a collection of words so I was thinking of like um Isaiah in in Isaiah 38:4 it said the word of the Lord came to Isaiah in Malachi I believe it's the first chapter the first verse says the burden of the word came to Israel by Malachi so maybe you would say the burden of the word came to Phoenix by brother Daniel and God puts the burden on my heart to bring some scriptures the word of God and to bring the word of God to you and it comes through a burden so it can be a collection of so Peter the word of the Lord came to Peter and he preaches a whole chapter but the gist the message of it was you need to repent you need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost brother du you shall be re refilled with the Holy Ghost and he said for This Promise is unto you that the Jews and your children and as to as many as the Lord Our God shall call and if you're sitting here today and you have a desire for a power in you that'll give you a power over sin and the ability to live above sin if there's something calling you for that then it's for you now there's some people that don't believe in it but I believe in it because I tried to live a Christian Life without the power of the Holy Spirit and you have to have the Holy Spirit in your life to give you power Jesus tells Peter who walked on the water fed 5,000 he said you go ter in the city of Jerusalem and you'll be endued with a power from on high is everybody with me and so he brings a word from the Lord you got to repent you got to be baptized if you're here today and you've never been baptized I want you to get baptized I think it's acts there on in the books the Bible says he commanded them he's very Stern he wasn't suggesting no he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved we need to get baptized anden he said you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and so there was a word of the Lord that came to him I was thinking of over in Acts the 19th Chapter this is such I've been studying this chapter 18 and chapter 19 there's a man Apollos comes by and he's he knows about Christ died and he rose again wouldn't it be a amazing thing to say this man died and he rose again he was going telling everybody look he's the Christ he's the Christ so Peter comes along he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed it's like we didn't know there was a holy ghost we just knew Jesus died and rose again and that's amazing he's the Christ and but Paul said no have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe we said we didn't even know there was a holy ghost we just heard Jesus rose and he ascended up on high and he so Paul comes and he tells them no no there's a holy ghost there's a power of God that will come back and F you and give you the power to live an overcoming life it's the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you need it every one of us need it sir the Bible says without the spirit of Christ you're none of his the Bible says is it Romans chapter 8 if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal body that's why you see people they come in they go for a long a while Church a few years and and then they go and then they just fade out into the world they needed something greater they needed that Holy Ghost and Fire that would give them power to live above sin I'm not talking about a theory I'm talking about something I experienced in my life can you say Amen to that and receive the power of the Holy Ghost and it comes into you amen it doesn't mean you're going to be perfect doesn't mean you're going to make a mistake but the Bible says when he the Holy Ghost has come he'll reprove you of sin and when you do wrong the holy spirit says no no no gives you a nice little spank said you're not going to live like that and you're not going to talk like that because sons of God don't live like that and talk like that God has a very plain voice I was thinking about that how that the word of the Lord comes and sometimes there's a whole message I was thinking of the message choosing of a bride I was looking it up in the room it's an hour and 41 minutes brother R preaches this message and tells about the prophecy of of California going into into the ocean and the gist of the whole message could be boiled down to Christ is coming for a bride and he will take that bride and Rapture her out then judgment will come on the earth California will go into the ocean somewhere the judgments of God we these are prophecies it's a word of the Lord that came from a prophet they might be delayed but they will come to pass I don't have time to get in to to all of those things but brother R tells us a 1500 m chunk will go into the ocean he says in another place everything on the face of the Earth will shake down those things are coming those things are coming it's been spoke by a prophet as a virgin Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive listen to me Isaiah went to the grave as a false prophet they said look no virgin ever conceived and brought forth and that didn't happen but 800 years later a virgin conceives and the word of that Prophet was a seed and it came to pass California's going to go in the ocean amen I'm here to tell you it's word of it's come by a Vindicated Prophet here's another one he had seven Visions is this okay you know what I am not a pessimist but I am a realist and I hate Scare Tactics but I do want you to tell me the truth the prophet of God comes he had seven Visions six of them have come to pass we don't have to preach on those and the the world war and the the the cars the autonomous cars we passed one yesterday my wife's like what is that I said that's that car uh brother R had the vision said he saw a car going down the road with no drivers it's one no and there the the prophecies being fulfilled he saw a woman rise in power he said to vice president he said it might be the Catholic Church we've got the vice president right there amen the these Visions are but the last one he had was America just being in ashes just ruined and we have people saying hey we're going to make America great I've said this before but I'm here to tell you the word of the Lord doesn't change the word of the Lord doesn't change amen California's going to the ocean America will be nothing but ashes and we're here today to remind our ourselves of the word of the Lord say Lord will you remind me of the word of the Lord that has been delivered and let it alter my life it altered moses' life it altered his career it will alter your life like hey I'm just going to forget church and go make a million dollars I'll be back when I'm for no no it'll alter your life say Lord let me live every day amen the Bible says it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an Angry God may the Lord help us to be sober I don't mean to be very Stern but I tell you the Bible says be sober we live in a world that is drunken they are going on intoxications on entertainment am me every country it used to be every country had their own little niche like was it Australia where they were engineers the Germans very exact and precise and now everybody's migrated and it's all mixed up but America has a niche on entertainment the world they cannot produce the movies and the entertainment and we become drunk on that amen the people it used to be people go look at pictures and then they started doing videos and then they started making movies and now they do YouTube shorts and people are become addicted and they and they get caught on these things we need to get away from those things and look to Jesus Christ and look to your soul that's worth a million worlds and stop playing with the world and the things of the world and let some nice person as a prophet of God said some nice person will shake you and say look she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she yet lives the world is making these zombie movies people walk around they're all kind of a the prophet of God Amen in the Bible said there's coming a time where people will be dead while they yet live now they're showing them making huge movies out but people that live in the pleasures of sin they're dead while they're yet living don't look at that get away from it get back to the realities of Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord amen it's good to be a Christian isn't it Noah's day God spoke to Noah and said build an ark the word of the Lord it alter his life forever build an ark and he got into it couple things about the word of the Lord is everybody with me all right nobody's sleeping everybody's awake okay there's one thing about the word of the lord we read it that the word of the Lord is inspired it's inspired I thought about that when God said let there be light and the Bible says and there was light the Bible says the Earth was without form and it was void and the spirit of the Lord moved over the the deep and that's way a lot of people were born into this world Amen and our parents try to lead us in the right way sometimes we get away from them and we kind of things go auk and you say you know what I'm like the Earth my Earth my my life is without form and it's void of any purpose and that's why a lot of people go and they take their life because their life has no purpose and the spirit of the Lord might move over them but the Earth needed something more than the spirit of the are you with me tonight something more than the spirit of the Lord to work move over it they needed God to speak to the Earth and God spoke and said let there be light and the Bible says and there was light oh if God could speak to our life amen and let there be light in whatever situation we is because the devil will lead you to Darkness there's only two forces light and darkness God and Satan good and evil we need to get back to that the devil wants to mix it all up and blur it all down but I tell you there was something about turning your way life completely to Christ and turning your life completely away from the devil can you say Amen to that it's a word from the Lord that speaks to you gives you confidence amen I was thinking about how the word of the Lord there's something the word is so powerful it's so inspired there's something and I'm going to come back to this later but the word of the Lord is so inspired it can be used in compound ways God spoke said out of Egypt have I called my son and we know when Moses came God called him out of Egypt and deliver he was a mighty deliverer and that was a great thing that but then the word of God Is So inspired it's compound meetings that Christ when he came out of Egypt he also came out as Moses was a type how many can see that and the the compound meaning was he called Christ out who also delivered his people so we find that the word of God is has a compound meaning when when John the Baptist went forth and said repent if I can read that same word of God today because the word of God knows no time it knows no space if I can read the same word of God today the message and the inspiration is the same as John preached repent be baptized I can read the same word of God and the Holy Spirit will come to his word we read it all scriptures given by inspiration of God the holy spirit will come to you and say you need to repent you need to get baptized tonight for the remission of your sins amen I was thinking about so many things how that the Holy Spirit we need to wait on the Lord you don't rush in and tell God God speaks sovereignly sometimes you got to when you and just because all I guess all of us are seeking the Lord for our lives you never get past that and God calls if some in this room and I heard this voice said Daniel Daniel I would try to move towards that voice that person may be in that room I go I go in there Daniel then I go and then maybe they're in another room and there's another and that's the way God is he speaks your name and then he wonders if you move the Bible says draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh unto you and all of us get in situation you might be a mother and you say I don't know how to deal with this situation with my child you might be a father and sometimes things happen and life other people make decisions and put you on a path maybe in your marriage and like Lord I'm I'm going to be a Christian wherever I am sometimes parents make decisions I make decisions I'm not going to serve the Lord but you know it used to be uh you know many years ago where we had good functioning families I taught Sunday school you tell look children obey your parents but now we live in a day where Mom and Dad sometimes get off the rails and they fall off the boat that's why the Bible says children obey your parents in the Lord but when they stop serving the lord then you stop obeying your parents when they say look you going into Walmart and steal some liquor say look I'll go into Walmart but I'm not stealing the liquor because my God says Thou shal not steal because my father is God the word of God Amen we need to be born of the word of God and when God speaks to you it gives you strength it gives you courage Paul was going in this way thinking he was doing right killing the Christians but God spoke to him he said who are you who are you you people sometimes when you experience the presence of the Lord you don't know what it is Samuel comes and God speak to him Samuel Samuel he went to somebody that was older him he went to his Pastor his he was backslid and his like no I didn't call you go lay down and the third time the backslid preacher like you know what I bet that's God speaking to them well I'll just tell them hey when that speaks again you say here am I your servant Lord I I hear and sometimes when God speaks to you you don't know what it is Sister Sandy was I'll share your testimony she was saying that she the Holy Spirit moved moved on her she was alone in a place and and and and God moved on her to speak in tongues and she didn't even know what it was I remember as a 17-year- old boy God was dealing with my heart and it just like I don't I can't explain I don't know it's something's moving inside of me and I want to surrender to Christ and he'll always he's a gentleman he'll never beat you he'll never abuse you he's a gentleman and when you move towards him he will move towards you I remember as a 17-year-old boy I was sitting on the second row about where this boy is sitting here they dismiss the service when God's dealing with you you're kind of glad when they dismiss the service cuz that leaves you alone with God and you can pray and you can draw close to God and we're here tonight that's what this church is for sir the Bible says this my house should be called a House of Prayer you want to pray till midnight somebody will be here to pray with you amen because this is where God speaks people like I've never felt the presence of God do you ever go to his house say brother Daniel's there I don't I sh you come to my house I can shake your hand you can feel my presence and and that's the same with God we need to be in his presence and not put him on all right God you got 34 minutes and ding I'm out of here but if we get on God's Time Lord what do you want to say to me Lord I'm here shape me and mold me and make it clear enough that I know it's you Lord if I got to get away from that boy you're going to have to have something greater than that boy if it's going to be greater than this girl and God's asking you to make a separation from that boyfriend or girlfriend then God you're going to have to give me something greater than that affection that I have towards that boy or girl and there is something it's Jesus Christ and it's the power of the holy spirit that can speak to you I remember I was on the second row and they dismissed I remember taking my coat off and I threw it over the altar I said Lord we're going to be here a while we've got some things to talk about I remember kneeling there and I had never experienced speaking in tongues or stabing lips but for two hours I laid on that Altar and I poured my heart out to God I said God this is all of it this is everything back into you know the churches and Ministries and this and this and I just poured my heart out to God I didn't even know what that was I I I was trying I said Lord I don't understand this but my heart I think that's what it says in Romans the 8th chapter the Bible says we know not how to pray but the spirit makes intercession with groanings that cannot be under Lord I don't understand it but Lord there's a burden in my heart something's speaking to me something's drawing close to God you know the Bible says no man can come except the father draws him and if you have a desire you wouldn't be here tonight if you didn't have a desire and God gave you that desire and God's trying to speak to every one of us and draw us closer to him and try to get us away from the noise of the world of the fashion and the internet and all these influencers I tell you what if somebody is influencing you away from the word of God they're going to take you to hell right amen don't follow the influencers to Hell God wants to make every one of you an influencer he wants want you to fill you with the power of the Holy Ghost and then you'll be a witness for God people trying to go out here get a million followers doing something immoral or extreme we get it all the time people falling off the grand Kings trying to get close to the edge of the perfect picture like God doesn't want you to live close to the edge of s he wants you to live as far as you can away from sin oh blessed be the name of the Lord we don't want to be stubborn some of you sisters you're just so wonderful people like my wife I think she tells me she only got one weapon growing up dad tell her one time she just does what's right right now we boys are a different thing like it's got to be 100 DCB or I don't even hear it you know I have I raised three sons I never had the little girl you you look at like stop screaming at me like I don't know how to our granddaughter come over once and I just kind of said something she just broke down and like what is that like it's different there is a difference between males and females I always kid him I said the boys they have a little button on the rear end unless you push it nothing gets to their brain you can talk in their ear and they don't get it but you push this button and then somehow like oh you don't want me to throw rocks at cars that's what it I remember one time we were standing out throwing snowballs at cars and then hit one and it was a police car and he turned around and come back so we ran the other way and we knocked on these people's house and then we thought we saw the police there we ran back and there was people standing at their door you know it's like ah you know so there something about boys but as after a while we grow up and then we here like yeah I shouldn't throw rocks at cars that's not good you know and that's the thing when you hear the voice of God you either he it or you'll pay the consequences of it yeah there people Sam Samson didn't heed the word of God and pretty soon he's grinding at the Mill going through the grind of life and and you know we don't want to be that way you don't want to be to that place to you ignore the voice of God and then drugs and alcohol and divorce and sexually transmitted disease and bankruptcy and heartaches and pains you don't want to go down that road I've seen too many go down that road run from it run to Christ he'll never do you wrong he'll give you joy and peace Amen in your heart I was thinking about this brother brand he's in the prayer line and we know God gave brother brandom a special gift that they would come and he would be able to discern and tell them brother M said this just be Reverend everyone be real quiet and listen watch he said now I've been speaking to you lengthy right now about an hour it's probably about how long I've been speaking to you he said but one word from God will do more than all I could say ministers might stand here which are far more able to preach than I and still you'd say that they really explained it nicely that was wonderful see but just let him speak one time that settles it that settles it I'm not brother brandom to do the discernment but God is still God and God can speak to every one of you he goes on to say in another message he said so lady no matter what I would say one word from God will mean more than I could say in 50 lifetimes but you be the judge if you're here for something I don't know you know I have no way of knowing what you're here for but if he does reveal to me like he did to his own son the the Lord Jesus to the woman at the well then you would believe that it comes from God and the lady no doubt said amen but what about us today if God I'm not brother bam I'm not going to stand here and pretend like brother bam but I'm here to tell you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if God speaks to you you'll know if it's God if you know there's some besetting sin in your life and you've hid it from mom and dad and brother and sister even the pastor or the minister but you can't hide it from God he's still a discerner today and he'll go all the way down in your life and say no but what about this he said then you'll know it's God and that's what we want to be we want to be in the presence of God not come together and hear a political speech but hear a man of God that surrendered himself to God and is is is honest and tell you there's a great judgment coming that we want to flee the Wrath that how do the Bible say it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an Angry God to fall into his hands of judgment we want to fall into his hands of mercy so many things I was thinking about let me just say what if the word of the Lord said you must be born again what if the word of the Lord came tonight said flee fornication what if the word of the Lord said come follow me and take up your cross and follow follow me what if the word of the Lord said Jesus Christ is coming soon then what does your career mean what does all the money in the world what does that boyfriend mean what does that girlfriend mean if you how's the Bible say what would have profit a man if he gained the whole world and then he lost his soul is this the scripture it's just straight out of the book it's God taking a word out of the Bible and making it real to our life he's trying to guide us as the one man said if you go to hell it's because you go and you te every bear Barcade that God puts up in front of you tear it down and say I want to go and God puts this little song puts this Minister puts this little story in front of us and we throw the roadblocks away and say I'm going to hell anyway over the prayers of my mother over the prayers of my father over the prayers of a minister that is praying and seeking god with a burden let's not go there let's go up to our father's house amen let's be Christians think about this powerful verse you should have this one marked in your Bible if you're a young person Isaiah 5:14 the Bible says therefore maybe we should turn to it Isaiah 5:14 I didn't give it to the brothers the Bible says therefore Hell hath enlarged herself think about that hell has gotten bigger it's enlarged herself and open her mouth without measure and you look at the sins of our parents and The Temptations and you can say this day this scripture is being fulfilled with the internet and all the lust and Hell hath enlarged yourself how's the Bible say Amen without majure there's no end sure it's a tree of Good and Evil and there's good people can work from home and earn a living that's the tree of good but the evil many times so outweighs the the good how many can say Amen to that amen may God help us today when we see the vomit of the world and the social media and the influences and the perversion yes amen may God help us just thinking how we can come to a close the Bible says all scripture which are the words of God that come to a man under inspiration think about this Isaiah's just going about his day God speaks to him and said Isaiah Isaiah a virgin's going to conceive like okay no Isaiah write it down okay and he writes it down he puts it down people laugh at him mock died him called him a false prophet but God spoke to him and the word of God is inspired and the word of God will come to pass can you say Amen to that and I say that these men didn't know when the Holy Spirit was moving on them that it was the word of the Lord I thought about David he said all my bones stare at me brother Ram said in one place he said if those men had thought about what they were saying they wouldn't have said it he said all my bones stare at me and and it was actually he was speaking it was inspired word of God and Christ comes later and fulfills those verses I thought about Abraham how that the Holy Spirit moved on him he said Israel shall dwell in a Strange Land 40 year 400 years because the word of God spoken under inspiration cannot be taken back it will come to pass and if God is speaking to you tonight and it's the inspiration of God you can't take it back it's right and if you don't heed to it it'll judge you somewhere that God has spoken to you you know what I think would be if someone sat and heard the voice of God speak to them and then they did contrary to it in hell to just have that 20 second clip played over and over and over and over you need to get away from that you need to repent of your sins you need to be filled with the Holy Spirit and hear my voice being played over and over and that would be hell that would be a place of Torment think I could have surrendered I could have got away from that relationship I could have shut that cell phone I could have got away from the evil are you with me tonight it's God speaking to every one of us not group therapy and spray but God speaking from the youngest person this little lady here that loves the Lord and she's seeking the Lord this young man here this young man here God speaking to you and directing the course of your life God doesn't speak to everything everybody the same way he speaks to you as an individual and God has something for every one of our lives and if we draw close to God he will will draw nigh to us I was thinking about the little boy and he went to church and he just said a b c d e f g h i and he did that every and a man come to him and said what what are you doing why do you say the alphabet in church he said well I wasn't raised in a Christian home and I don't know how to pray but I have this stuff in my heart and I want to talk to God about it and I just say the the alphabet and I know that he'll take the letters and he'll put them all together and make the words for what my heart is trying to say I can tell you that English is a learned language but there is a language of God that's much deeper than that it's a spiritual language where God speaks to you and you as a young lady find a place to kneel and pray and God begins to deal with you God begins to give you the confidence that he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you he said lo I am with you always I will lead you and guide you and we need a guide in this day and age we are dealing with things in the Church of God and parents we things we've never seen before it's unprecedented times but we've have a holy spirit amen the Bible says as the day is so shall your strength be and God will be with us he'll never leave us I have that confidence in him no matter what we've gone through brother Ron and sickness and heartache and pain and suffering he has never left us and he will not leave us as long as we believe in him and stay with him amen blessed be the name of the Lord I have a handkerchief in this um pocket that I need I have this problem do y'all any of you have problems in your life I have a lot of problems all right I have crutches like my eyes I can't see very good so I wear contacts I hide them so you don't see them I've got another problem when God squeezes my heart my eyes leak it's a problem you know but David said a broken and a contrite heart God would never despise people say I haven't cried in 20 years that didn't make you a man that probably makes you a brute because the greatest man Jesus the Bible says Jesus wept shortest verse in the Bible you probably did in Sunday school they had a verse Jesus wept all right learn another verse Bible say Jesus went up over Jerusalem and he wept over the condition of the church I believe there's still men of God who weep over the condition of the way the church is going you see people get involved in maybe activ and they're so caught up in the activities but what about the church the church is the called out the Ecclesia people that are called out from the world and really and they weep over the direction of the church Real Men of God that have the spirit of Jesus Christ do you know any men like that are concerned about the church and they have a bird and say I I just we need to draw closer to God we need to get away from the world as Bible say if we love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in you we need to draw close to God and let God speak to us Real Men of God that God speak to us in prayer amen where we spend times in prayer that's where God makes men real sons of God is in prayer when you don't know what to do we need to pray the Bible says pray without ceasing we that's what's lacking a lot of times is prayer we need to draw close to God and God has a way of making you pray you maybe get away from the Lord the Lord will put you on the flat of your back in a hospital somewhere amen and you'll say all right Lord I'm listening because pain is one of the greatest attention getters and I don't want to get to the place where I have a wrecked and my back's broken I'm laying there Lord what are you trying to tell me no let's just come tonight and say Lord will you speak to me will you direct my life I don't want to have my marriage broke up and kids going everywhere and all right Lord I probably didn't go to church and I didn't read my Bible and I didn't pray but Lord I'm listening now I don't want to do that I want to say Lord I'm listening tonight Lord I'm listening I don't want to lose my mind brother B said those girls go out and dress in those clothes he said they're neurotics they've lost their mind Lord I don't want to lose my mind and be out there somewhere and a gutter somewhere at a bar and somebody's taking advantage of me I want to sit in the presence of God and get my worth from the presence of God and God comes down and says I love you and I care about you and you're worth something oh my how the word of God is speaking and pulling tonight I I just this little story comes to mind it's something you know I've got another problem in my life and I'm just the Bible says confess your father fults one to another so I have another problem I don't have a great memory but I have a crutch it's called a computer so I take really good notes take a lot of notes so before I come I went back and was reading my notes and the first time I was here is this okay I'm just going to tell a story and I'll close Okay in 2017 we came for the first time and we we had the Youth Camp up in Prescot and the first night the Holy Spirit moved in such a wonderful way the Holy Spirit was touching hearts and there was eight people that stood to their feet and said I want to I want to dedicate my life to God it was such a beautiful time brother Ron and thank God for brother Ron the burden that he has to bring us into the presence of God God bless you my friend sister Sandy she might have slipped out but so that was the first night the next morning brother Ron said I want to have questions and answers he had questions and answers all we as young people some of you all may have been there wrote questions out turned him into brother Ron he answered him and the counselors however they was they answered him but at the end of the service my heart is etched with this brother Ron at the end of the service I was sitting in the sound booth and brother Ron said is there anybody else that wants to say anything is there any counselor wants to say anything I was sitting in the back because I had to preach that night sister Sandy said I I've got something to say and she said you know last night there was eight people that stood after the preaching and said I want to dedicate my heart to God and she is a Godly sister and she said but I know that something is telling me that there's more than eight people that need to give their heart to the Lord there's more sisters that are not dressing right and problems with their hair that they need to dedicate their heart to the Lord now the word of the Lord is the word of the Lord it doesn't matter who says it and she made that statement and when she did it etched my heart I I wrote the notes and here we are seven years later I'm quoting it but that night when she said that and we came back to the service and I preached and the Holy Spirit came down in such a wonderful way I don't know if you remember brother Ron there we had a 5 hour service and young people coming to the front dedicating heart to God brother Ron sitting there weeping because it's a presence of the Lord there's something about the word of the Lord when it speaks to you and God you sister Sandy and her word to say there's more in here that need to dedicate their heart to the Lord I'm here to tell you that holy men of God moved were moved by the Holy Spirit and they wrote things down and years later you could quote the word of the Lord and it would [Music] reinspection we wrote it down and we can read it today and it's but as I read that the other day and the Holy Spirit came back to my heart and said that's the word of the Lord and if it was the word of the Lord seven years ago I believe it's still the word of the Lord tonight there's more people that need to dedicate their heart to the Lord and I tell you I want to be one of those people that dedicate my heart to the Lord when God speaks the Bible says don't Harden your heart as in the provocation but surrender yourself to Christ amen let's just bow our heads if the musicians will come Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight with all of our heart that little song I surrender and Lord as we've just begin to speak Lord it seems like a solemnness has just come in this room Lord I'm not concerned about the lights or the cameras Lord I'm just concerned conc erned about a word from the Lord that would speak to each one of [Music] us Lord I pray that you would speak to every heart now Lord every young man he would know the voice of God that would speak to him the voice of the Holy Spirit every young sister Lord the Holy Spirit would speak to them now as they're playing the song I surrender I Surrender I give my life to you Lord Jesus father I'm standing here as a minister with my hands raised to you tonight saying Lord I Surrender I give my life away to you father what would it profit us Lord if we gained the whole world and we lost our [Music] soul God may you speak to us in a real way yes Lord God may your presence come to every heart May there be no one that walked away and say I didn't feel the presence of God God as the Bible says that Cain went out from the presence of the Lord God May there be no one that would go out of the presence of God lord bad things happen when we go out of the presence of God but Lord when we come into the presence of God is the maniac you said one word go Lord and The Cutting stopped and the Darkness and the nakedness he was clothed in his right mind with the people of God I pray Lord that you would help us tonight as the holy spirit is speaking here and you've been so attentive tonight had tears in my eyes I wonder if that word that sister Sandy spoke seven years would still be real and you'd say brother Daniel I need to dedicate my heart to God tonight you'd like to raise your hand say I want to dedicate my life to God you'd raise your hand God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you God sees your hand Hallelujah this may be a little different but I feel led to do it if God's speaking to you and say you know that word that spoke to Sister sty it's still the same God we say it again and tell the story and God comes inspires it I wonder you that raised your hand if youd just come down front and stand along the front with the extension of your face say I'm not ashamed I want to dedicate my life to God you just would not be ashamed just come down front stand down front here and just say I want to consecrate my life to God Amen don't be ashamed God sees your hands he said if you stand for me I'll stand for you if you're ashamed of me I'll be ashamed of you say Lord I'm not ashamed tonight God it's the word of the lord it's quick and it's powerful amen I Surrender I Surrender amen just be in prayer right now Lord I Surrender my life Lord I want to stand for you amen is there anybody else that say I want to at my life to God I want to come up front and I want to take a step out I want

it's all about yielding the Bible says be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever you yield yourself to you become the servant thereof either to righteousness or to unrighteousness and some of you you've come up before and given your life and then you come back you want to do it again why is is that because you're struggling with that yielding so be not deceived some of you been yielding to the wrong thing that's why you want to rededicate your life well that that's good but watch this just be serious with God be sincere be not deceived it's very simple just yield yourself there's yield signs when you get onto the freeway yield what happens if you don't yield you crack up what happens in this end time young people you y yourself to the wrong thing you get onto the internet you get onto the things that we didn't even have when we were young people now it's just a press of a button in the wrong direction next thing you know you're in an area that you shouldn't be in and then you struggle and you know you shouldn't be doing it but you do it anyway and you know what that does every time it hardens your heart a little bit harder and Harden Harden you know how you get calluses on your hands and they get hardened it's cuz you're doing huh don't let your heart become callous keep it soft soften My Heart Lord [Music] yes some of you even that are sitting right out there right now some of you have just gotten a little bit [Music] hard yeah you're having a you're having a hard time cuz you're not yielding like you should you know it I'm speaking to you [Music] now you're struggling you may put on the face there with everybody and sing some songs and everything but you know I'm [Music] struggling I'm speaking to you right now that's a word a word he gave such a simple word has struck your hearts but some of you you've been yielding to the wrong thing and you know it now Jesus when he spoke to that woman at the well woman where are your accusers was she guilty she was woman where's your accusers uh she looks around Lord I I have none neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more yes you young people learn to yield you know how you yield in the morning read your Bible give God some time that's yielding to him because if you yield in the morning you will find it so much easier to be able to give God what is his throughout the day start your day in prayer and meditation take a minute I didn't ask you to take an hour read a whole chapter recite verses and no no no no that's not it but a yielded heart and a yielded vessel how many of you say that's what I want to do I want to yield more huh I want to give God more if you want more of God give God more of you the greatest thing you have you know what it is it's your heart it's your [Music] heart great greatest possession you have throughout this life is your heart and God just ask you if you'll give me your life yes if you'll give me your life I will give it back to you and more abundantly and anyone that will come unto me I will in no wise cast him [Music] out hallelujah praise the Lord I believe God has done a work here tonight it's not some something that you have to work something up is the Simplicity of the Gospel amen thank you brother Daniel come up here my brother come up here with me coworker of the Gospel come up here [Music] heard from the Lord do you think it could be something so simple that God gave you a word what if it changed [Music] destinations what if you did something strum the cords of their heart and they answered and they come up here you know what brother Daniel was not working on emotions and some of you had that little boy that prayed a b CDE e huh Lord I don't know how to put it together yes so I'll just say the alphabet you put the words together yes just as I Am Without One Plea I come to you yes how simple brother Daniel thank you for being a yielded vessel I want you to pray now over all of these pray all for everyone that's here that tonight is a different night it'll be a time that you just rededicate yes even if you've been a Christian for years and been walking with him but you haven't been lately remember the LA one of
