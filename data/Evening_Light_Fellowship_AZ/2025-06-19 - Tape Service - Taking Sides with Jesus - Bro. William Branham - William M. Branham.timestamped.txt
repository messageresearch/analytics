[0:23] to cover me.
[0:26] So all the world
[0:30] they will see

[0:43] Amen. Sing one more before we take the

[1:28] the room. I feel Jesus in the room

[3:03] I can see the father run
[3:07] saying, "Welcome home, my son. There's
[3:11] forgiveness in the room
[3:14] today.
[3:16] [Music]
[3:18] Amen. I trust whatever we have need of,
[3:21] he's here to meet our needs.
[3:24] Amen. We have a few prayer requests
[3:26] tonight. First, brother Kelly McMillan,
[3:30] he needs special prayer. Um, his throat
[3:32] surgery is not until July 8th. Um, he uh
[3:37] he has nas a nasal feeding tube. He
[3:39] hasn't been able to eat or swallow a
[3:42] couple weeks due to throat cancer. So,
[3:45] let's just pray for brother Kelly,
[3:48] brother Mario Chua. He's home sick with
[3:51] the flu. So, if we just remember brother
[3:53] Mario and in prayer if we would. Austin
[3:57] Johnson's requesting prayer for a family
[4:00] friend, Dana Gray. She is advanced stage
[4:03] cancer. She's a mother with four kids in
[4:06] her early 30s and she's also a widow.
[4:09] Amen. Lord knows the need there.
[4:13] And then Andrew and Anissa Kennedy are
[4:15] asking prayer for Alden. He's on the
[4:18] mend, but he's had a rough few days of
[4:20] fever and cough. And then also an
[4:22] unspoken request for brother Andrew.
[4:25] Amen. Brother Andy Manard, if you would
[4:27] come take these to the Lord. If we could
[4:29] just sing I feel Jesus in the room one
[4:30] more time. Oh, I feel Jesus in the room.
[4:36] I feel Jesus in the room. I feel Jesus
[4:41] in the room today.
[4:44] [Music]
[4:47] Yes. And when he's in the room,
[4:51] things won't say the same. I feel Jesus
[4:56] in the room
[4:58] today.
[5:00] God bless you. Thank you.
[5:04] Let's all pray together.
[5:07] Lord, we thank you for your
[5:12] this place, Lord, that you set aside for
[5:14] us. Thank you, Lord. We can come, Lord,
[5:17] and
[5:19] we pray that everybody came with a big
[5:21] cup tonight that you'll fill it up,
[5:24] Lord.
[5:26] Lord, sometimes it we know you how
[5:28] vindicated you are, Lord, in your word
[5:31] and your mercy and your grace. And
[5:35] sometimes it seems like we see such
[5:38] vindication of how weak and
[5:40] insignificant we are. But Lord, that's
[5:43] so we can depend on you.
[5:46] Lord, if we're dependent on ourselves,
[5:49] we've got something to learn. Amen.
[5:53] Lord, I pray tonight that you would uh
[5:55] meet the needs of these spoken and
[5:57] unspoken requests, Lord. And Lord, just
[6:00] ask that you would help us, Lord, in
[6:04] this dark age, Lord. It seems to be just
[6:06] getting darker and darker like you can
[6:09] almost feel it.
[6:11] But Lord, if that light,
[6:15] which you are the light, if you're in
[6:17] us, Lord, we can shine.
[6:21] Maybe we'll help someone along the way
[6:23] that they might
[6:25] turn around. Lord, I pray that you give
[6:28] us all those opportunities to be the
[6:31] light of the world, the salt of the
[6:32] earth, and may we walk out of the doors
[6:34] tonight better at being that. Bless the
[6:37] speaker, bless the hearer tonight. We
[6:40] commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[6:45] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[6:49] Just one quick announcement from the
[6:51] Terren family. They'd like to wish Bryce
[6:54] a very happy 12th birthday tomorrow. So,
[6:56] if we just
[6:59] wish Bryce happy birthday, may the Lord
[7:01] bless you. Amen. And if we could sing
[7:04] that song, when I think of the goodness
[7:06] of Jesus,
[7:10] when I think of the goodness of Jesus
[7:16] and all he's done for me,
[7:21] oh my soul cries out, hallelujah,
[7:26] praise God for saving me.
[7:31] Yes. When I think of the goodness of
[7:35] Jesus
[7:37] and all he's done for me,
[7:42] oh my soul cries out, hallelujah.
[7:47] Praise God for saving me. One more time.
[7:52] Yes. When I think of the goodness of
[7:56] Jesus
[7:58] and all he's done for me,
[8:03] my soul cries out, "Hallelujah.
[8:09] Praise God for saving me."
[8:14] And I'm leaning,
[8:17] leaning,
[8:20] safe and secure from all alarms.
[8:24] I'm leaning,
[8:27] leaning,
[8:30] leaning on the everlasting
[8:34] arms. And what a fellowship, what a joy
[8:40] divine, leaning on the everlasting
[8:44] arms.

[9:42] safe and secure from all alarms. I'm

[10:01] have I to fear? Leaning on the
[10:04] everlasting
[10:06] arms.
[10:08] I have blessedness with my Lord so near.
[10:13] Leaning on the everlasting
[10:16] arms. I'm leaning,
[10:19] [Music]
[10:20] leaning,
[10:23] safe and secure from all alarm.
[10:28] Leaning,
[10:30] leaning,
[10:33] leaning on the everlasting
[10:37] arms. Yes, I'm leaning,
[10:41] leaning,
[10:43] safe and secure from all alarms.
[10:48] Leaning,
[10:51] leaning,
[10:53] leaning on the everlasting
[10:57] arms.
[11:01] Amen. If we could sing that song. Um, we
[11:04] do have a song special tonight. I want
[11:06] to just give a a special welcome to my
[11:08] parents. They're here tonight. So, my my
[11:11] dad, Brother John, has a song special
[11:14] for us. But before he comes, if we could
[11:16] sing that song. What a beautiful name it
[11:18] is. The name of Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[11:23] You were the word at the beginning,
[11:29] one with God the Lord
[11:33] most high.

[12:08] compares to this.
[12:11] What a beautiful name it is. The name of
[12:17] Jesus.
[12:21] It didn't want heaven without us. So
[12:27] Jesus, you brought heaven down.
[12:35] My sin was great. Your love was greater.
[12:40] And what could separate
[12:43] [Applause]
[12:44] us now?

[12:54] The name of Jesus
[12:57] Christ, my king.
[13:01] What a wonderful name it is.
[13:04] And nothing compares to this.
[13:08] What a wonderful name it is. The name of
[13:13] Jesus.
[13:15] And death could not hold you. The veil
[13:20] tore before you. You silence abose
[13:25] of sin and grave.
[13:29] And the heavens are roaring.
[13:33] the praise of your glory.
[13:37] For you are raised to life
[13:41] again.
[13:43] Lord, you have no rival.

[15:01] And nothing compares to this.
[15:04] What a beautiful name it is. The name of
[15:10] Jesus.
[15:12] Amen. Let's give the Lord a praise
[15:14] offering. Amen. He's so good to us.
[15:20] Thank you for singing
[15:23] everybody for the prayers. Three weeks
[15:25] ago today, I had surgery on my back and
[15:29] I know you prayed for me. I just want to
[15:32] thank you for that. I'm already feeling
[15:34] better than before the surgery. God is
[15:36] good. He's my healer and I'm just so
[15:38] thankful for for him. So, Amen. Good to
[15:41] be with you tonight and just so good to
[15:44] feel the presence of the Lord. We know
[15:46] he's here and we've welcomed him. So, we
[15:48] just want to continue to have him have
[15:50] preeminence in the service tonight.
[15:53] Amen.
[16:07] On a balcony
[16:11] of space
[16:14] stepped a pure
[16:17] and holy God
[16:21] and an awesome
[16:24] solitude.
[16:27] He stood alone.
[16:33] Not one faint star
[16:36] to give him light,
[16:40] just endless rolling
[16:44] blackest night.
[16:47] But somehow
[16:49] through all the darkness
[16:53] he could see.
[16:57] [Music]
[16:59] He saw mountains
[17:02] high and lofty.
[17:05] He saw valleys
[17:08] lush and green.
[17:11] He saw babbling brooks.
[17:14] wild flowers grow.
[17:18] Even heard
[17:20] a robin sing.
[17:24] But he felt
[17:26] a strange compassion
[17:30] as close to love
[17:33] as pain could be.
[17:38] standing out there
[17:42] in his tomorrows.
[17:45] [Music]
[17:47] He
[17:49] saw
[17:51] me.
[17:55] Yes, he saw me
[18:00] in his likeness.
[18:03] He saw me
[18:07] just like him.
[18:10] Pure,
[18:12] clean, and holy,
[18:15] [Music]
[18:17] spotless
[18:19] white within.
[18:24] But he saw me bound
[18:27] in heavy chains
[18:30] and long to set me free.
[18:36] But he knew
[18:39] if I
[18:41] became like him,
[18:45] he must
[18:48] become
[18:50] like me.
[18:57] Jesus
[19:00] paid it all.
[19:05] All
[19:07] to him I owe.
[19:12] Sin
[19:14] had left a crimson stain.
[19:21] He washed
[19:24] it white as snow. Could you sing that
[19:28] with me?
[19:30] Jesus
[19:33] paid it all.
[19:38] All
[19:40] to him I owe.
[19:45] sin
[19:47] had left a crimson stain.
[19:53] He washed
[19:56] it white as snow.
[20:04] Amen.
[20:26] God bless you all this evening.
[20:28] Let me see. I'll use this one here. God
[20:31] bless you all this evening.
[20:33] God bless you all this evening. Amen.
[20:36] Yeah, you're there. You're there. God
[20:39] bless you. Amen. Um tonight we're going
[20:43] to go ahead and listen to a portion of a
[20:45] tape. Um I feel it is an extremely
[20:50] pivotal time in the prophet's life.
[20:54] And uh as one that studies the message
[20:57] as well as the Bible, you begin to see
[21:00] that there are certain things. Jesus
[21:04] said, "From henceforth,
[21:06] I call you no more servants, but I call
[21:09] you friends."
[21:10] That was a pivotal time. That was a time
[21:13] when things were changing.
[21:16] And the prophet of God, now remember
[21:19] from his birth, he's been floundering
[21:22] around wondering what does all of this
[21:25] mean?
[21:27] Uh the pillar of fire came over his bed
[21:31] through the window, you know, at his
[21:33] birth. And he's 1933.
[21:37] The voice spoke and said, "As John the
[21:40] Baptist forerrun the first coming of
[21:42] Christ, you and your ministry shall
[21:44] forrun the second coming."
[21:47] He's had dreams and visions. He's had
[21:50] angels come and speak to him. And uh and
[21:54] yet he's he's wondering, "How will all
[21:58] of this come to pass?" because God, we
[22:01] know you fulfill your word, right? But
[22:06] I don't know how you're going to do it.
[22:09] And so, um, this sermon, taking sides
[22:13] with Jesus, I've told you before, you
[22:16] begin to look and see patterns
[22:18] of certain ministries, whether it's of
[22:22] Elijah, Elisha, different ones within
[22:25] the scriptures. You see the life of
[22:27] Christ from the time that he took the
[22:29] scroll of Isaiah and he found where it
[22:32] was written of him and he said this day
[22:35] is this scripture fulfilled. God's God
[22:38] was doing something that was a
[22:40] milestone.
[22:42] And so the ministry of Christ lasted
[22:45] three and a half years. Although he was
[22:47] here on earth, he was crucified at 3 uh3
[22:52] and a half years of age. Remember, he
[22:54] entered the ministry at 30,
[22:57] excuse me. And when you look at the Old
[22:59] Testament, you find out Levitical
[23:01] priesthood does not enter their their
[23:05] priesthood until they're 30 years of
[23:07] age. So, we see patterns and types. And
[23:10] you go back from 1965 of when the
[23:13] prophet went off of the scene, take it
[23:15] back three and a half years, you come
[23:17] exactly to this this uh sermon.
[23:22] And brother Brandham is having um a time
[23:27] of what am I to be? Am I an evangelist?
[23:31] Am I a prophet? Uh it's been the mixing
[23:35] of the two gifts. And he's very
[23:38] transparent to us. And he's letting us
[23:42] know that uh there's coming a change in
[23:46] his ministry. He said, "You all know as
[23:48] long as I hold on to the first pole, the
[23:51] second poll can't come. As long as I
[23:54] hold on to the second, the third can't
[23:56] come." Right? Brother Brenham said here,
[23:59] uh, I just hold on just a second.
[24:07] He says in the anointed ones at the end
[24:10] time, notice the very day when this
[24:13] messenger, not when he starts on but
[24:17] when he begins to declare his message.
[24:20] See first first pull healing.
[24:26] Um second pull prophesying. Third pull
[24:30] the opening of the word the mysteries
[24:32] revealed. Yeah. No more.
[24:36] There is no more higher order to reveal
[24:39] the word than prophets. But only the
[24:42] only way the prophet can be vindicated
[24:45] is by the word. Now remember the third
[24:47] pull was the opening of them seven seals
[24:52] to reveal the hidden mystery truth
[24:55] that's been sealed in the word. Do you
[24:58] see it? Amen. All right. So I want you
[25:01] to all stand. Let's sing uh we'll sing
[25:04] only believe before we read the
[25:05] scriptures here. But uh I will go ahead
[25:10] and um
[25:13] I'll be taking some notes and I want
[25:15] some of you to also I want you to to
[25:18] look and ask God
[25:20] give me understanding of a prophet's
[25:23] ministry. What is he doing? What is he
[25:25] saying?
[25:26] Why is he taking sides with J? I thought
[25:28] he's always taking sides with Jesus.
[25:31] What? Why is he naming it this? What
[25:34] what what's going on? Uh what does he
[25:38] see? So, let's just sing. Brother Greg,
[25:41] you can go ahead and take this here. I
[25:43] I'm just going to have you only
[25:47] believe.
[25:50] Holy
[25:52] be
[25:56] all things are possible.
[26:02] Only
[26:04] believe.
[26:08] Only
[26:10] believe.
[26:14] Only
[26:16] believe.
[26:20] All things are possible
[26:24] [Music]
[26:26] only
[26:28] believe.
[26:30] Amen. Thank you musicians. God bless
[26:33] you. Let's just turn with me if you
[26:36] would to the scriptures.
[26:38] Amen. Let's go to second Corinthians
[26:44] chapter 2.
[26:49] Second Corin I didn't give this to the
[26:50] brethren there. If they can pull it up
[26:53] that's fine. 2 Corinthians
[26:57] chapter 2 verse 7.
[27:01] But we speak the wisdom of God in a
[27:04] mystery
[27:05] even the hidden wisdom which God
[27:08] ordained before the world unto our
[27:10] glory.
[27:13] So this hidden wisdom is actually
[27:16] something that God
[27:19] has ordained to our glory.
[27:22] Think about this. The revealing of the
[27:25] word, the mysteries been revealed.
[27:30] Makes you a part of the glory of God in
[27:33] its revealing.
[27:36] All right. Verse
[27:39] 12. Now,
[27:41] now we have received not the spirit of
[27:44] the world, but the spirit which is of
[27:47] God, that we might know the things that
[27:50] are freely given to us of God, which
[27:53] things also we speak, not in the words
[27:56] which man's wisdoms teacheth,
[28:00] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth,
[28:03] comparing spiritual things with
[28:05] spiritual. Verse 14.
[28:09] But the natural man receiveth not the
[28:11] things of the spirit of God, for they
[28:13] are foolishness unto him.
[28:16] Neither can he know them, because they
[28:19] are spiritually discerned.
[28:23] But he that is spiritual judges all
[28:26] things, yet he himself is judged of no
[28:29] man. For who hath know the mind of the
[28:33] Lord? that we may instruct him. But we
[28:37] have the mind of Christ.
[28:41] May God add the blessing to the reading
[28:43] of his word. You may be seated tonight.
[28:46] Amen. I got to thinking about where were
[28:49] we conceived? Where were we in the
[28:52] beginning before time began? We were in
[28:55] the mind of God.
[28:57] So
[28:59] we dropped down into a a glitch called
[29:03] time.
[29:05] And here we're going back to where we
[29:08] were in the beginning. So how does God
[29:10] do it? Takes you back. If you started in
[29:14] the mind,
[29:16] he takes you back to what was in his
[29:18] mind, revealing to you the very
[29:23] the very mysteries of God himself.
[29:28] And so from the mind of God, here we go.
[29:31] Now spiritual thinking coming back to
[29:33] the mind of God,
[29:35] alpha coming back to omega. Amen. God
[29:38] bless you all. So, we would like to go
[29:41] ahead and for those of you that have a
[29:46] cell phone or an iPad, something and you
[29:49] want to get this sermon, it is uh taking
[29:54] sides with Jesus,
[29:56] uh
[29:59] 1962601.
[30:03] And we're going to be projecting it on
[30:05] the overhead here so that you can see
[30:08] it. And I want you to really take notice
[30:11] of what he's
[30:13] of what he's saying
[30:15] and listen carefully because he's
[30:18] sharing you with you what's happening in
[30:22] his ministry
[30:25] and he has preached sermons such as
[30:28] change of ministry um explaining the
[30:32] ministry or the ministry explained or uh
[30:37] the present stage of my ministry.
[30:40] All of this, he's speaking to the people
[30:42] to let them know something's changing,
[30:46] something's happening.
[30:49] So, uh, if we could, brethren, you could
[30:52] go ahead and when you're ready, let's
[30:54] play from the very beginning here. And
[30:58] what we'll do at the end, if you guys
[30:59] will watch me, when I come back up to
[31:01] the pulpit, you cut it off there and
[31:04] mark it down so that when we if we don't
[31:07] finish it. I know we won't finish it all
[31:09] tonight, but on our next service where
[31:11] we have another tape service, we'll do
[31:13] that. Brethren, God bless you as we all
[31:16] listen to God's servant and prophet,
[31:18] Brother Brenham.
[31:25] some place in Louisville where you you
[31:28] eat and it's called um uh let's see dog
[31:33] patch restaurant. I got one today. When
[31:36] anyone eats there then they take the
[31:38] money that you gave them and send the
[31:40] church the tithing off of it. Some work
[31:43] at 319 West Jefferson Street. I guess
[31:46] that's why Billy had it laying here so
[31:49] they could see.
[31:52] Um that's mighty nights.
[31:56] Now brethren,
[31:58] I don't know what your procedure of of
[32:01] man's meeting just what you do or how
[32:05] you conduct your meetings and if I get
[32:08] off a schedule here, why off the regular
[32:11] routine, why you call my attention to
[32:13] it. It was purpose tonight. I thought as
[32:18] I had uh a dinner not long ago with our
[32:23] most beloved pastor, Brother Neville,
[32:26] and I was saying something to him, what
[32:29] was on my heart. And I thought if we get
[32:32] a bunch of man together and the
[32:34] ministers, our uh colleagues here of the
[32:38] gospel and man, we could talk to one
[32:42] another in a way that we wouldn't talk
[32:45] it before the public because we're all
[32:48] in we're man understand is man,
[32:51] Christian man. And that way uh usually
[32:56] in a congregation, a group, you say
[32:59] something and and want to lean it a
[33:01] little this way and one lean it that way
[33:02] and and then it goes all out. But where
[33:04] we come to try tonight to tell you what
[33:10] I have in my heart
[33:12] uh concerning the church and its uh and
[33:16] its uh place and its position. And then
[33:20] if we get done in time, I would like to
[33:22] speak to you just a little bit on the
[33:24] word if it's all right. Just kind of
[33:26] settle that. So we'll get our business
[33:28] part or the part that I like to express
[33:30] to you first. And I guess maybe you let
[33:33] out regular time about 9:30 or something
[33:35] like that, like each night.
[33:38] Well, I'll try not to keep you long.
[33:40] Tomorrow, Saturday, and the big
[33:42] commercial day, but now,
[33:46] uh, we have to get our groceries and so
[33:48] forth.
[33:49] I want to say to brother Neville
[33:51] publicly now I I want to say to each one
[33:54] of you just like I was talking privately
[33:56] to you just each one because you're a
[33:58] group that that's uh I really think that
[34:02] and believe and teach that man God has
[34:05] made man leadership of his church of his
[34:08] people. See, and it's uh as I was
[34:11] preaching down to brother um Juny
[34:14] Jackson's last night about God fortified
[34:18] his his people with his word. And it was
[34:21] a woman that broke through that line and
[34:24] give vent to reason. And when he did,
[34:26] God forever has always placed it for his
[34:30] uh for man to keep his church fortified
[34:33] by word. Now
[34:38] uh I want to encourage brother Neville
[34:40] just a little talking to him privately.
[34:42] I noticed last night the zer has struck
[34:45] me till three times I was in the pull
[34:46] pit and I turned around because I'm
[34:48] trying to keep as far away from it as I
[34:50] can until I find out what the dream
[34:53] meant to me here not long ago. A few
[34:55] weeks ago it stuck with me for a long
[34:57] time. I told it here in the church about
[35:00] something about the message and and
[35:02] discernment and so forth. It just didn't
[35:05] just wasn't coming out right. To my
[35:08] opinion, that time's over. And um I may
[35:11] be wrong on that, but I noticed that it
[35:14] um Brother Neville was kind of weary and
[35:18] upset. And I just want you to know,
[35:22] brother Neville, that you're only
[35:24] anticipating in this fellowship in that.
[35:27] Have you just noticed what Satan's tried
[35:29] to do in the last few days that what
[35:30] ministers that's associated in this
[35:32] fellowship?
[35:34] Just stopped for a few minutes and
[35:35] wonder brother Craig sitting here
[35:37] tonight. Almost killed up there on the
[35:39] road. See, and uh I almost had my head
[35:43] blow off with a shotgun or with a rifle.
[35:46] See, Satan trying to take us there. you
[35:49] crashed right in and could have killed
[35:50] yourself and some woman also. See, just
[35:53] the ministers. Look at just the the
[35:56] ministering group.
[35:58] It's Satan
[36:01] and he's trying to get rid of us.
[36:05] Now, we are realize that we're not
[36:08] assembled here to talk on some kind of a
[36:09] business. We're here to assemble to talk
[36:12] on the on Christ and the hopes to take a
[36:17] hold and what to do for this present
[36:20] time.
[36:22] And I I want to encourage you, brother
[36:25] Neville. Uh be courageous.
[36:28] No matter what comes up, what goes, what
[36:31] takes place, just don't let nothing
[36:33] beset you. Just stand there like a rock
[36:35] of ages and God will make everything
[36:37] come out all right. He's proved that to
[36:40] you. Of course, you that could have
[36:41] upset you. That could have killed that
[36:43] woman and had been on your mind the rest
[36:44] of your days. There been a lot of
[36:46] things, but God is still on the throne.
[36:47] He He lets those things work out all
[36:49] right. It could have taken us, too. And
[36:53] um
[36:55] so Satan fighting at the church. Now,
[36:59] when I laid that cornerstone there that
[37:01] morning, I never felt that I'd ever be a
[37:05] pastor. It wasn't in my callings at the
[37:08] beginning and my first call was to be on
[37:12] the field of evangelism as many years
[37:14] ago and started off over here in a tent
[37:17] just across the street and I remember
[37:20] when brother Roy Davis down there and
[37:22] his church burnt down that bunch of
[37:23] people was just like scattered sheep
[37:25] without a shepherd had no place to go
[37:27] and
[37:29] Mr. Mr. Hipsenberg was chief of police
[37:31] then and he called me down there and he
[37:32] said to me I we're here to help you said
[37:35] I'm Catholic myself but said them people
[37:37] said they don't probably had the closes
[37:40] during the time of the depression said
[37:41] they go to other churches they feel out
[37:43] of place and they're good people I know
[37:45] many of them he said Billy if you want
[37:47] to start a church he said I want you to
[37:48] know that we're behind you and anything
[37:50] we can do to help you and I thanked him
[37:53] for it we had a tag day first we prayed
[37:56] and asked the Lord and people come to me
[37:59] and wanted to build a church so I could
[38:01] have a place to go. And uh we decided
[38:04] this place and one night along this time
[38:06] we're a little further here in a pile of
[38:07] horse weeds right along in here and
[38:09] water this ditch and just had been a
[38:12] like a dump like well the Lord spoke to
[38:15] me definitely said build it right here
[38:18] not a penny of money and among us we had
[38:20] about about 80 cents or a dollar and
[38:24] that of course you would laugh at that
[38:25] now brother that was some money then
[38:28] when some neighbor cook a pot of beans
[38:30] and get the neighbor had nothing two or
[38:32] three days, come over and eat a few of
[38:34] them. That was hard times. A lot of the
[38:37] young fellas ever seen that. Well, that
[38:40] was hard going. I've seen a time that
[38:42] you could pass through this church, a
[38:44] collection place two times or three and
[38:46] get 30 cents out of a place packed full
[38:49] and begged for it. It would you probably
[38:51] got 30 cents and had a good offering.
[38:53] And it's really rough going. And we had
[38:56] nothing to deal with. Yeah. the the
[38:58] desire of the people was to build a
[39:01] church so he could have a place to go
[39:03] because in them days the message well
[39:06] you think it's badly thought of now you
[39:08] ought to know it then when there's
[39:10] nobody and then this water baptism in
[39:13] the name of Jesus Christ and the
[39:15] blessings and things that we believe in
[39:16] and stand for.
[39:19] So upon my heart I made a a promise to
[39:23] God that we would stay here and build
[39:24] the tabernacle. the morning we laid the
[39:27] cornerstone. He met me over there in a
[39:29] vision about 8:00 that morning when I
[39:31] was sitting there watching out across
[39:33] the sun coming up just about this time
[39:35] of year. And he had told me after he had
[39:40] met me down on a river, but that when
[39:43] the angel of the Lord appeared in that
[39:46] that light and I seen it in the
[39:48] distance, it looked like a star and it
[39:49] come right down over where I was and
[39:51] then notable words was spoken. And uh so
[39:55] then uh purpose then to get a place for
[39:58] the people to worship in. Now I thought
[40:01] myself it ain't for me. It's nothing to
[40:04] me. But yet anything that's con
[40:08] pertaining to God
[40:11] is part of me. No matter if it's
[40:14] anything that's it's uh for God's
[40:18] children. It's for me whether it's my
[40:20] duty to do this or do that. It's my duty
[40:23] to see to God's heritage regardless of
[40:25] where it's at. See, just like you say,
[40:27] well, my like as a little boy, he say,
[40:29] my my business is just to chop the wood,
[40:32] not pack it in. Let John pack it in. I
[40:34] don't care if snow falls or it rains,
[40:36] let him get out and get it. No, it's
[40:38] your duty as a as a a child of that home
[40:42] to see that that wood don't get wet for
[40:44] your mother. See, pack it in. If they
[40:47] say, "Well, Frank should have went and
[40:49] got the water." It ain't my business.
[40:50] But if Frank didn't get the water, it's
[40:52] your business to take care of the water.
[40:54] That's all. Uh that's just way it runs.
[40:56] And that's the way it runs in God's
[40:58] family, too. If some of them, some of
[41:00] them said the other not long ago said,
[41:02] "Quit preaching the way you are. My
[41:04] goodness, you're going to ruin every
[41:05] friend you got and everything like
[41:06] that." Said, "Let that alone. I know
[41:07] it's wrong, but my it ain't our
[41:09] business." Well, whose business is it
[41:11] then? If it's wrong, somebody's got to
[41:13] do it. Amen. So, let's just do it. And
[41:16] that's the way I feel about the church.
[41:18] The building programs and so forth has
[41:21] come up and down up and down and there's
[41:24] been pro and con in the buildings and so
[41:26] forth. One wanted the other didn't want
[41:28] it and this that you you find it like
[41:30] that. You find that as you deal amongst
[41:33] ministers, amongst businessmen, amongst
[41:36] lodges everywhere you go where you got a
[41:38] group of men you you've got different
[41:41] ideas.
[41:43] And so therefore, you've got to have one
[41:46] person that you put confidence in and
[41:48] elect that person all work with that.
[41:50] It's like in the army, you've got to
[41:52] have one as a general. That's a
[41:54] headquarters. Captain says this, he's
[41:56] the captain of that group, but then the
[41:58] general can change his orders. And the
[42:00] chief commanding general, of course, is
[42:02] Jesus Christ in the church. And his
[42:04] ministers are his uh captains of the
[42:08] companies that that's representing him
[42:10] here on earth. And
[42:13] they have tried many things, the little
[42:16] tabernacle here. And finally, I kept
[42:18] quiet in it just to see after I'd built
[42:22] it. And then the Lord called me out into
[42:24] the field about 15, 16 years ago, and I
[42:27] left the church. But still, I just can't
[42:31] turn it out. I've always kept my name
[42:33] attached to it so that I could be a vote
[42:36] sometime. If the wrong thing got started
[42:38] in here, I'd have a right to come and
[42:40] and stop it because I've sweated it out
[42:44] for many years behind this pulpit. 17
[42:46] years in here to keep the thing straight
[42:49] when all kinds of isms and ins and outs
[42:51] and every kind of a cult and being the
[42:54] inner denomination everything that flew
[42:56] in, flew in this way and by the help of
[42:58] God, we stood here with the
[42:59] unadulterated gospel and she still
[43:01] stands the same tonight. And so we but
[43:06] this times that this church has been
[43:07] tried to be sold out from under me and
[43:09] everything else like that. If my name
[43:11] wasn't attached to it down there, why it
[43:13] sure would be been an awful fix tonight.
[43:16] Not and it wasn't me. It was God of
[43:18] course that did it. And then as I see it
[43:21] now coming into the place that it is and
[43:23] we're living in a great hour, it's still
[43:25] my interest to say something about this
[43:27] church. See, because it's it's a part of
[43:30] me. No matter whether I'm here or not,
[43:33] it's still a part of me. And it's my
[43:35] duty to see to it that it operates
[43:37] clean, clear, and the best I can for the
[43:39] kingdom of God. And I'm very grateful
[43:44] that in these days I see it's got little
[43:46] satellites to it. that I am grateful for
[43:49] brother uh Crair and his Sersburg group
[43:53] and brother back there that just taken
[43:56] brother Snelly's place at Udica and
[43:58] brother Ruddle up here and brother
[44:01] Junior Jackson those precious boys who
[44:04] are fine man wonderful man of God they
[44:08] preach this message now they may one
[44:11] might disagree just literally up on
[44:13] something another that's only human
[44:15] amongst the group of the ministers yet
[44:18] And um if ministers have a little
[44:20] difference, there won't be a a shadow of
[44:22] a difference in it. Maybe one might say,
[44:24] "I believe that the millennium will come
[44:27] and Jesus will be on a white horse."
[44:28] Others say, "I believe when he comes,
[44:30] he'll come on a white cloud." Well, as
[44:32] long as they believe he's coming. That's
[44:33] the main thing. See, no matter how he's
[44:35] coming, just they believe he's coming
[44:37] and making ready for it. And um that way
[44:41] I have tried to find out and I've been
[44:44] studying. I told it out before the
[44:46] congregation.
[44:47] I've been studying the early church and
[44:51] I watched the way that those anointed
[44:53] men uh prepared uh the house of the Lord
[44:58] and the order of the Lord's worship in
[45:01] the house and it struck me real real
[45:05] good and I preached her some time ago
[45:08] and upon the subject of Joel uh two I
[45:12] will restore sayaeth the Lord all the
[45:16] years of the pal worm eating and a can
[45:18] caterpillar and tank of worm and so
[45:20] forth. And um I began to study on that
[45:25] about what these men did and the way
[45:28] that they um taking care of the church
[45:33] that God had left him overseer. Now
[45:35] we're going to start off with the early
[45:38] church and just bring it for about five
[45:40] minutes now down to what they did and
[45:42] then I can show you the vision that I
[45:44] have for the future.
[45:47] Now at the beginning the church was
[45:50] inaugurated at Pentecost
[45:53] and there the Holy Spirit fell upon them
[45:56] where Jesus had chosen 12
[45:59] and one of them had fallen and they
[46:02] chose Minus to take his place and the
[46:04] Holy Spirit waited until all this was an
[46:09] order before it come. They had to choose
[46:12] one to take the bishopy of of Judas that
[46:15] fell by transgression to fulfill the
[46:17] scripture. And I believe that all these
[46:20] things has a time of lingering waiting
[46:24] but it's waiting for a time for the
[46:26] scripture to be fulfilled that
[46:28] everything gets right. Everything in
[46:30] ordering
[46:32] many times we get p impatient like a
[46:34] child. We great get great anticipations
[46:37] and many times jump way ahead and that
[46:39] that just hinders the work until the
[46:42] work gets caught up. You see, we must
[46:44] just move reverently, have a purpose in
[46:48] heart that God if he would desire to use
[46:50] us in such and such, but wait till he
[46:53] makes the opening cause he has to go be
[46:57] ahead of us. You remember David going to
[46:59] battle that night? He was weary about
[47:02] that fight and he laid under those
[47:04] malleberry trees until he heard the Lord
[47:06] and the rumbling of the leaves going
[47:08] before him. Then he went with courage
[47:11] because he know that God had gone before
[47:13] him. And if we'd only do that, brethren,
[47:16] knowing the battle must come, but we
[47:19] must wait till we see the hand of God
[47:23] going before us to make a way. Amen. Now
[47:27] I notice that how the churches the
[47:30] evangelism started scattering out
[47:32] everywhere and then we'll take for
[47:35] instance
[47:37] Paul becoming a great missionary to our
[47:39] people.
[47:41] We find out that he went about wherever
[47:45] the Lord led him and he established the
[47:47] church and it was a new faith. the
[47:51] churches of those days like in Asia
[47:54] Minor all throughout Europe they they
[47:57] didn't believe that message and when he
[48:00] had preached the message
[48:04] and many was converted to it then there
[48:07] was no one if he left the people in that
[48:10] condition they'd wander right back out
[48:12] into their pagan gods and into Judaism
[48:14] and whatever more because the people had
[48:18] no one to teach them the the converts,
[48:21] they had no place to go. So Paul
[48:24] established churches in different parts
[48:27] of the country. Each one of these
[48:29] churches, he left someone who was an
[48:33] order, a man that was trustworthy,
[48:37] a man that was known as a pastor,
[48:40] shepherd or
[48:43] uh then after this church then become
[48:49] other little churches come out of it,
[48:51] young man and old man raised up and
[48:53] become uh churches out of that. The man
[48:56] that was over the first church was
[48:59] called the bishop.
[49:02] And then his that went out from him, his
[49:05] children was called shepherds or
[49:08] pastors. And then this group of little
[49:12] churches all would come back to this
[49:14] bishop. Back in the time of Ireinius, he
[49:18] carried on the same thing. Martin
[49:21] carried on the same thing. Polocarart
[49:24] carried on the same thing. right on down
[49:26] through the age. They had that. And then
[49:29] the apostle of the church, the apostle,
[49:32] that was the Paul. And when Paul left,
[49:37] John took over the church. And when John
[49:42] left, Polocarp taking it over. When
[49:45] Polocarp left, Arinius taken it over.
[49:48] and on down. Martin and so forth just
[49:51] kept on going until the Roman Catholic
[49:54] Church broke the whole thing to pieces
[49:56] and burn them and scattered them and the
[49:59] polymer worm eat this and the canker
[50:01] worm eat that and so forth eat that and
[50:03] eat that until it brought it plum down
[50:05] to a stall. Now, but God promised to
[50:08] restore
[50:10] again that same thing.
[50:13] I have I do believe with all my heart
[50:17] that we're living in the last days.
[50:20] Amen. I believe that there there's not
[50:24] too much would break the anything and my
[50:28] interpretation may be wrong of the
[50:31] scriptures
[50:32] that Jesus could not come tonight. I
[50:35] believe it and what little that to be
[50:37] fulfilled could be fulfilled before
[50:39] daylight in the morning. Yeah, that I'd
[50:41] see and I may be wrong on the time of
[50:43] that fulfilling but it's at hand
[50:48] the I believe that and remember Paul
[50:52] believed that John believed that Polart
[50:55] believed that Irene believed that Martin
[50:57] believed that all the rest of them
[50:59] believe that
[51:00] what if God would have told John the
[51:02] revelator now it's going to be 2,000
[51:06] years before my coming John would have
[51:10] come told the church, "Well,
[51:13] I guess we might as well eat, drink, be
[51:14] merry, cause going to be many
[51:16] generations." See, uh, Jesus ain't
[51:19] coming for 2,000 years. See? So, see,
[51:22] the church have been loose. There have
[51:25] been no on the mark. There have been no
[51:28] waiting. After all, it's your
[51:31] anticipations. If you fall asleep in
[51:34] that watch that you wake with them same
[51:36] anticipations because they ain't going
[51:37] to hinder one thing. You're going to be
[51:39] right there on time. Anyhow,
[51:41] see what I mean? Now, when when St.
[51:45] Martin awakes in the resurrection, St.
[51:47] Paul, all the rest of them, it'll be
[51:49] just as fresh as if they was right in
[51:51] the battle battling right away cuz he
[51:53] went right down under those same
[51:55] anticipations looking for his coming.
[51:57] And there'll be a screen coming up will
[51:59] come the whole church. You see, that'll
[52:01] be it. So, it doesn't matter. See, we've
[52:04] got to be looking for him right now.
[52:07] Even we don't know it. It could be
[52:10] possibly it could be a hundred years
[52:12] from now. It could be 500 years, a
[52:14] thousand years, 10,000 years. I don't
[52:17] know. Nobody knows. But say for instance
[52:20] that we live each day that he was coming
[52:24] that day. If we live like he was coming
[52:27] this day when we awake, if we sleep and
[52:30] we awake in the resurrection, it'll be
[52:32] just as fresh as if we just fallen
[52:33] asleep. Just woke up. The trumpet will
[52:36] sound. The dead in Christ shall rise
[52:38] first. We which are alive and remain
[52:39] shall be caught up together with him to
[52:41] meet the Lord in air. See shall be just
[52:43] as fresh. But now until that time until
[52:48] he comes we want to live each day like
[52:52] he might come the next minute because it
[52:55] might be the end of your life at that
[52:57] minute. You don't know when you're
[52:59] going. This may be some of our last
[53:03] breath. We have it in us now.
[53:06] So you want to live like it is. But now
[53:10] to carry on further, we've got to put
[53:14] footprints here on the sands of time
[53:17] that others can see. If Paul hadn't went
[53:20] on the way he did, then John wouldn't
[53:23] know how to follow. If John hadn't went
[53:25] on, Polocart wouldn't have known how to
[53:27] follow. If Polocart wouldn't have went
[53:29] on, Ireneius wouldn't know how to
[53:31] follow. Byius wouldn't have went on.
[53:33] Martin would have known how to follow.
[53:34] See what I mean? Each one has to put
[53:38] footprints on the sands of time.
[53:42] Well, if I thought that there was a
[53:45] denomination or any other group of
[53:48] believers that had anything better than
[53:52] we have here, brethren, I would want to
[53:56] emerge this little body with it right
[53:57] quick. I've waited. I have longed. I
[54:01] have been under anticipations and
[54:04] believe that some great one was coming
[54:06] someday or maybe the great prophet that
[54:09] I speak will come of the Elijah. I've
[54:12] always believed and thought maybe that
[54:15] maybe I'd live to see the day that when
[54:17] I could change when I'd see that person
[54:20] rise on the scene then I could take my
[54:23] little church and say, "Brethren,
[54:25] this is the man we have looked for. this
[54:28] man, he is the one. I've waited for
[54:30] that. And if actually that has passed,
[54:36] then I'm looking to say it from up here,
[54:38] brethren. This is the one coming from
[54:40] here. See, and I want to see the church
[54:44] kept up like that. I must have stepped
[54:47] on something or done something and put a
[54:49] lot of uh more uh life in that thing.
[54:53] So, um now I would like to say this.
[54:57] that now that this is an established
[55:00] church,
[55:01] let me just stop again just a moment.
[55:04] When I went to Bombay, I count that my
[55:07] greatest meeting because of the effects
[55:10] it had on the people. And I if in Africa
[55:14] they say 30,000 came to Christ at one
[55:17] time, then there was 150 or 200,000 came
[55:20] to Christ at one time out of that half a
[55:22] million there.
[55:25] What could I do?
[55:27] There wasn't a thing perhaps maybe say
[55:28] there was just say there's 100,000 of
[55:30] them there was no church nothing I could
[55:34] do there's nobody to give to them the
[55:36] message I believe I there wasn't even a
[55:39] Pentecostal denomination would cooperate
[55:41] with me and all those souls probably
[55:43] drifted right back into se Buddhism
[55:46] whatever more they come from no place to
[55:49] put them now that's a shame that's a
[55:52] disgrace
[55:54] see because I had no cooperation
[55:56] operation because of the stand that I
[55:58] take.
[56:00] Well, in Africa, I went in there under
[56:02] that opaces of the uh the
[56:07] AF of
[56:09] African faith missions. And when I did,
[56:12] of course, I can't agree with them. They
[56:14] they baptized people in a triumph
[56:17] baptism three times face forward. One of
[56:19] them baptizes three times backward. one
[56:22] for one God the Father and the other for
[56:23] another God the Son, the other for
[56:25] another God the Holy Ghost and baptizing
[56:27] three different times for three
[56:29] different gods and all such stuff as
[56:32] that and perhaps the Durban meeting
[56:36] not having it rightly and the people see
[56:38] such a scattered amongst the Pentecostal
[56:40] faiths and so forth the people didn't
[56:42] know what to do they had no place to go
[56:45] perhaps what if we just had a revival
[56:47] here brother let me place it like this
[56:50] what if we just got through the big
[56:51] revival and you brethren had just got
[56:53] converted and there wasn't a church of
[56:54] this type in the country nowhere and
[56:56] I've been the evangelist and now I'm
[56:58] leaving out. You may never see me again.
[57:01] What would you do? You'd feel like you
[57:05] wouldn't know what to do. You can't go
[57:07] back to that waller again. You can't go
[57:10] back down there with uh with your wives
[57:12] to wear shorts and your and uh to your
[57:16] card parties and dances and things like
[57:19] that and never be satisfied again.
[57:21] You've come to life. You've raised above
[57:24] that thing. You've come to a place
[57:26] instead of saying this is our creed
[57:28] saying this is God's word and you've
[57:31] come to live by this what this says and
[57:34] not what and you go down there and
[57:36] listen to them and hear them go down
[57:38] play bunk ho and have a dance and this
[57:40] that and the other a little bit of
[57:41] message that had nothing in it about
[57:43] some mayor or something or was going to
[57:45] be reelected or some kind of a political
[57:47] affair and cut off in 10 or 15 minutes
[57:49] after you've been sitting here day after
[57:52] day in great gastronomical jubilees of
[57:54] the word and things you wouldn't know
[57:56] what to do. You'd be so burdened with it
[57:59] to some of you lay members would feel
[58:01] like starting up a church and start
[58:02] preaching yourself because your heart
[58:04] would burn for the word of God and you'd
[58:07] feel bad for the people that felt the
[58:10] same way you did. Isn't that right?
[58:13] Though you know Jesus is coming, thought
[58:15] he was coming tomorrow, yet you'd want
[58:16] to do something today for those people
[58:18] who fellow citizens of the kingdom of
[58:20] God to come together. You want
[58:22] fellowship with them. That's right. So
[58:26] if it's this way now, I believe with all
[58:31] my heart that the Lord has helped me and
[58:34] has used me to spearhead a great
[58:37] revival, one of the greatest has ever
[58:39] struck the world since the early days
[58:41] across the world. We know that. That's
[58:43] right. All gone at that time. And and he
[58:46] met me down there on the river and told
[58:48] me that the message that I had would
[58:50] forun the second coming of Christ.
[58:54] And I suppose there's nobody here
[58:56] tonight that was down there that day.
[58:57] That's been about 32 years ago when that
[59:01] light appeared and standing there at me
[59:03] looking right at it. Hundreds of people
[59:04] standing looking at it. They come right
[59:06] down and that voice spoke years later.
[59:09] Strange that the camera takes the same
[59:11] picture. Looks the same thing just
[59:12] exactly what I told you on the river.
[59:14] Now I may be mistaken in a lot of
[59:16] things, brethren, but I don't want to be
[59:17] a hypocrite. I want to be honest and
[59:20] straight with you. And then another
[59:23] thing,
[59:24] if id have went away, what would we have
[59:26] never built a church here like that?
[59:28] It's hard to know what we'd had. See, if
[59:30] I just went on, but the God of heaven
[59:32] put it upon my heart to build this
[59:34] church here. And then when he called me
[59:36] out into evangelism, we've had pastor
[59:39] after pastor and so forth, but now we
[59:42] got a a precious brother here who's uh
[59:46] of the faith, believes the message.
[59:49] We've got other brothers out here that's
[59:51] believes a message haven't Am I getting
[59:54] too loud, Brother Beer? All right, let's
[59:56] see. Yeah. Um had uh we got we got the
[1:00:01] material
[1:00:03] and now you say, "Well, brother Brandon,
[1:00:06] if they won't hear these signs and
[1:00:07] wonders of the great God of heaven, how
[1:00:10] we going to do it?" Well, now what if
[1:00:13] St. Paul would have had that same idea?
[1:00:15] See what? But he didn't. those bishops
[1:00:19] stay just as loyal to the message and
[1:00:22] they and Paul ever so often after making
[1:00:25] his round you've read the Bible how he
[1:00:27] visit back with these churches talk with
[1:00:29] the pastors and with the bishops and so
[1:00:32] forth and tough uh relief from the
[1:00:35] people and and had a oh just a great
[1:00:38] time of fellowship like a revival or a
[1:00:40] big time of jubilee and the Holy Spirit
[1:00:43] would fall upon them and messages would
[1:00:45] come look when he went down there to
[1:00:46] Philillip even his daughters prophesied
[1:00:48] and said these chains and prison waiting
[1:00:50] for the for our brother when he gets up
[1:00:52] there and no more got out in the yard
[1:00:54] and here come acus a prophet walking
[1:00:56] down looked across the street had never
[1:00:58] seen Paul before the general overseer
[1:01:01] this whole group of churches throughout
[1:01:03] Asia and he walked over there and pulled
[1:01:05] a string off of his side he had his
[1:01:08] garment tied with bound his hands and
[1:01:10] said thus sayeth the Lord chains and
[1:01:13] prisons wait for the one that wore this
[1:01:15] up there see prophesy and Paul said, "I
[1:01:18] know it. I know it, but don't break my
[1:01:20] heart now. Let me finish my course." He
[1:01:23] was tired. He was finished. And he was
[1:01:25] going on and leaving his bishop with
[1:01:29] Timothy. Now, we got to think of young
[1:01:32] people. We got children.
[1:01:35] Most of us people here, married man has
[1:01:38] children. Well, what about them? It's
[1:01:40] coming on. See, like I used to kick up
[1:01:44] down there about them throwing those
[1:01:46] cast nets on the river, pulling out them
[1:01:48] perch and the drinks, drunkards and
[1:01:50] things. I've seen them piled high as
[1:01:52] this ceiling here. Big fine perch laying
[1:01:54] there to stink and be all around the
[1:01:55] river. I went out as a game warden to
[1:01:57] make him stop it. I got to let her leave
[1:01:59] him alone. What are you going to do? It
[1:02:01] belongs to Kentucky. Now Kentucky warden
[1:02:03] can't come over here because he's out of
[1:02:06] his territory. Indiana warden has
[1:02:08] nothing to say into it because the water
[1:02:09] belongs to Kentucky. There you are.
[1:02:12] Nothing could be done. I said, I've got
[1:02:13] a boy coming on will like the fish. Why
[1:02:16] did they put his picture in the paper if
[1:02:17] he caught a chub? 20 years now. Let that
[1:02:20] go on like that. Those nets, traps, and
[1:02:22] everything else. It's practically
[1:02:23] getting like that right now. See, what's
[1:02:25] the matter? You've got to think of these
[1:02:27] as coming on. So, we've got to think of
[1:02:30] the others that's coming on behind us,
[1:02:32] these young people, and so forth. And a
[1:02:34] place for our children, our daughters.
[1:02:37] We don't want them out in the world and
[1:02:38] these things like that. We want them
[1:02:40] girls raised like their mothers and
[1:02:42] we've got to make arrangements for that.
[1:02:44] And if there is no tomorrow, we don't
[1:02:46] know that. If there is no tomorrow, we
[1:02:49] haven't done nothing but been at the
[1:02:50] master's business and been found at our
[1:02:52] post of duty when he does come. See, so
[1:02:55] I would suggest this. I did brother
[1:02:57] Neville. Let's carry this on just as we
[1:03:01] have. Let's let it just the way it is.
[1:03:05] I'm grateful for these young ministers.
[1:03:07] See, actually at the day of judgment for
[1:03:10] this entire valleys to hear there will
[1:03:12] be no excuse because we've got little
[1:03:15] churches setting out everywhere.
[1:03:19] Outpost, listening post waiting. Last
[1:03:22] night and brothers church and asked if
[1:03:26] all in there was fortified behind the
[1:03:29] word and every hand went up. Now that
[1:03:31] made me feel good. See now what I would
[1:03:35] think would be this brethren
[1:03:38] at like in the church here now I the my
[1:03:43] ministry
[1:03:44] has the best amount of thinking four
[1:03:48] things that can be done and it might not
[1:03:50] be either four that's the only outlook I
[1:03:52] can think of if that one has spoke to me
[1:03:55] down there on the river if this is all
[1:03:58] that was left for the gentile church
[1:04:00] which we realized In Revelations, it
[1:04:03] says one, two, three chapters to the
[1:04:06] church. The church goes up in the fourth
[1:04:09] chapter. It does not return anymore to
[1:04:11] the 19th chapter. That's after the
[1:04:14] tribulation period. When God calls out
[1:04:17] the Jews, right? And like Enoch, he went
[1:04:21] up before one drop of rain ever hit the
[1:04:24] earth. It was gone. Then the tribulation
[1:04:26] set in. See, Noah was in the ark before
[1:04:30] any tribulation set in. Lot was out of
[1:04:34] Sodom before any tribulation set in.
[1:04:36] See, and the church will be gone before
[1:04:39] any tribulation period. Now during the
[1:04:42] tribulation that will be the sleeping
[1:04:45] virgin will be hunted down by the dragon
[1:04:50] spurts water from his mouth which it
[1:04:53] means multitudes and people armies
[1:04:55] that'll search down and take this woman
[1:04:59] uh uh remit of her seed and will kill
[1:05:02] her. Now
[1:05:04] that will be in the tribulation period
[1:05:07] but the church will go home. Now, if
[1:05:12] if that take would take place tomorrow,
[1:05:15] it wouldn't hinder miskeeping on today.
[1:05:18] Let's make today count.
[1:05:20] Now,
[1:05:22] what I think down there, if that angel
[1:05:25] that said those words to me said, as
[1:05:29] John the Baptist was sent to forun the
[1:05:32] first coming of Christ, see, your
[1:05:36] message
[1:05:38] has to take this message and it would
[1:05:41] forerun the second coming of Christ.
[1:05:45] Well, if this has been it,
[1:05:48] and we're real real close, brethren,
[1:05:51] because the hour and the light of the
[1:05:54] message just about gone out. Did you
[1:05:58] notice when Pentecost fell and those
[1:06:00] brothers were filled at Pentecost with
[1:06:02] the Holy Ghost, it wasn't hardly any
[1:06:04] time until the message had be to dim
[1:06:07] down and they begin to set up churches
[1:06:10] the whole for Christ, expecting him to
[1:06:12] come. That's the same thing is taking
[1:06:15] place today if the scripture is true. I
[1:06:17] will restore sayaeth the Lord all that
[1:06:20] the palm of worm and cake of worm has
[1:06:22] eaten. Now
[1:06:26] if that be it if that is the message and
[1:06:30] God forgive me I I do not know if that's
[1:06:33] it then the time is close at hand really
[1:06:37] because the message is over. And the
[1:06:40] other night I was dreaming that I went
[1:06:41] to have discernment where a great host
[1:06:44] of my friends are gather thousands of
[1:06:47] them in a meeting. There's a fellow come
[1:06:50] got me and Billy usually comes gets me
[1:06:52] because he don't talk to me. This man
[1:06:54] just talked to Blue Street and before I
[1:06:56] got over there all the anointing was
[1:06:58] gone from me for it. And then I said,
[1:07:00] "Well, I'll just go over there and and
[1:07:03] preach the message of telling those
[1:07:05] people, don't fool those denominations
[1:07:06] and so forth and come out like this."
[1:07:09] And when I got to the platform, that had
[1:07:11] left me.
[1:07:14] I don't know what it meant, but I was
[1:07:16] going on.
[1:07:18] I just don't know.
[1:07:21] It could be the end of my road.
[1:07:24] It could be the coming of the Lord.
[1:07:27] It could be the change of the day. It
[1:07:31] could be the coming of that mighty one.
[1:07:33] If it's to be another besides what's
[1:07:35] already come, it could be that.
[1:07:38] All those things we'd have to draw from.
[1:07:42] It would be. And as I stand here tonight
[1:07:45] before God and you, brethren, I don't
[1:07:47] know. I couldn't tell you. If I did, I'd
[1:07:50] tell you. Or I wouldn't mention bring
[1:07:52] anything up like this. If I didn't know
[1:07:53] which way if I know which way the thing
[1:07:56] was going, I' i'd say it, but I don't
[1:07:58] know. I can't tell. I'm going right now
[1:08:00] on meetings without one speck of
[1:08:02] leading. I'm going because I don't want
[1:08:05] to set up there. I I I like to get out
[1:08:09] in the woods as well as anybody.
[1:08:12] If I'm wrong in this, God forgive me.
[1:08:17] There's three things could happen to me.
[1:08:20] It's either the end of my road and let
[1:08:23] this other one come on. I've opened up
[1:08:25] the road for him to take over. Remember,
[1:08:29] the one that comes to preach will be on
[1:08:32] the word restoring the faith of the
[1:08:35] children back to the fathers. It could
[1:08:38] be the end of my road.
[1:08:40] It could be
[1:08:42] that he's changing my ministry back into
[1:08:45] evangelism or overseas.
[1:08:50] Or it could be that he's not going to
[1:08:53] call me anymore for an evangelist and
[1:08:56] he's taking me into the wilderness
[1:08:59] somewhere to anoint me
[1:09:02] to send me forth
[1:09:05] like the promised one is to come. I
[1:09:07] think
[1:09:09] there could be any of those things.
[1:09:12] I cannot go on the way I've been going
[1:09:16] because I'm the people
[1:09:20] has believe me I I have to say this I
[1:09:22] said before man the people many times
[1:09:26] regard me as being a prophet I do not
[1:09:29] regard myself that no sir I do not I
[1:09:33] have I don't say that to be humble I say
[1:09:35] that to be truthful I do not regard
[1:09:38] myself to be a prophet of the Lord I I
[1:09:42] that honor. I believe that the Lord has
[1:09:46] used me and little special things to
[1:09:49] help maybe lay a foundation
[1:09:53] for a prophet that will come. But a
[1:09:56] prophet doesn't operate the way I
[1:09:59] operate. Now, you know that a prophet
[1:10:03] isn't an evangelist
[1:10:05] and an evangelist isn't a prophet.
[1:10:09] A pastor isn't a evangelist, then a
[1:10:12] evangelist isn't a pastor.
[1:10:15] But God is set in the church, first
[1:10:18] apostles, then prophets, then teachers
[1:10:20] and pastors and so forth. God set them
[1:10:23] in the church and God gave them an
[1:10:25] office. But the morning when I laid that
[1:10:28] cornerstone because, now if you're
[1:10:31] spiritual, you get it.
[1:10:33] because of the cry of the people.
[1:10:37] If you could break that out or take the
[1:10:39] book and read it, it said, "Do the work
[1:10:42] of an evangelist."
[1:10:45] Didn't call me to be evangelist, but
[1:10:47] said, "Do the work of an evangelist, for
[1:10:49] the time will come when they will not
[1:10:52] endure sound doctrine,
[1:10:54] but for heap themselves together
[1:10:56] teachers having ancient ears, and shall
[1:10:58] turn from truth to fables."
[1:11:02] see quoted that scripture and told me
[1:11:04] where to find it. Said it three times
[1:11:07] and I got the Bible and turned to where
[1:11:08] he told me and there it was. And now you
[1:11:11] know about the two buckets of the
[1:11:12] Pentecostal oneness and the Pentecostal
[1:11:14] assemblies. I never crossed them. I
[1:11:16] planted their own trees right where they
[1:11:18] were because I think they were both
[1:11:19] wrong.
[1:11:21] But out of it, I was at the cross at the
[1:11:24] harvest.
[1:11:26] God respects anybody who's sincere.
[1:11:30] Peter said that he perceived that God
[1:11:32] was no respective person. All nations
[1:11:34] calling when on the house of Cornelius
[1:11:36] when they received the Holy Ghost like
[1:11:38] they did at the beginning. See God is no
[1:11:40] respect of person. We see a person
[1:11:42] deeply and sincere, he can be sincerely
[1:11:44] wrong. But if he is sincerely, God will
[1:11:47] lead him to the light somewhere. He'll
[1:11:49] come to it because God's obligated to do
[1:11:51] that. And we think about the coming of
[1:11:53] the Lord being such a a great thing and
[1:11:56] the message no more than it went. And
[1:11:58] remember, there's a predestinated group
[1:12:00] to be here when the Lord returns. And it
[1:12:03] might not be over a dozen.
[1:12:06] We don't know. It might be 100 million,
[1:12:08] might be 10,000.
[1:12:10] But if the predestinated
[1:12:13] will hear the message and believe it, if
[1:12:15] it's the message sent of God, which we
[1:12:18] believe it to be. Now here we are then
[1:12:22] right up here to the end of the time
[1:12:24] when if God did call me now listen this
[1:12:27] is not to be repeated. If he did call me
[1:12:30] to be his prophet then I'm certainly not
[1:12:33] holding the office of one. Prophets
[1:12:36] don't evangelize.
[1:12:38] A prophet hides himself in the
[1:12:41] wilderness alone with God until he gets
[1:12:45] exactly directly what God wants him
[1:12:47] doing. He stomps right out and gives his
[1:12:49] message and back into the wilderness he
[1:12:51] goes again.
[1:12:53] He's not an evangelist holding meetings
[1:12:56] and getting cooperations and all these
[1:12:58] things like evangelists do. He don't
[1:13:01] teach like evangelists. He has thus stay
[1:13:04] at the Lord and that's it and that's
[1:13:06] all. He gives it throws it out. Let the
[1:13:09] chips fall where it will and then way he
[1:13:12] goes again. Nobody knows where he's at.
[1:13:15] He's in isolation somewhere. Now I
[1:13:18] cannot or if he's called me to be that I
[1:13:22] cannot be an evangelist.
[1:13:25] And if he's called me to be evangelist,
[1:13:27] I cannot be a prophet.
[1:13:30] Now you get what I mean? I don't know
[1:13:32] what to do. I've done reverently when he
[1:13:36] told me first about be holding people's
[1:13:38] hand and praying for them, then know the
[1:13:39] secret of their heart and all these
[1:13:41] different things. And brethren, that's
[1:13:43] infallible. You know that's to be the
[1:13:44] truth. Every one of you knows that.
[1:13:46] and how he told me it would blast across
[1:13:48] the world and it's done it just exactly
[1:13:51] every nation under the heavens and heard
[1:13:53] everywhere newspapers
[1:13:56] tape recordings everywhere I don't know
[1:13:58] how it's ever done it but throughout all
[1:14:01] the world letters coming in and people
[1:14:03] from way down and piling in the hot tops
[1:14:06] back in there how those missionaries has
[1:14:08] crowded back in there with those tapes
[1:14:10] and giving that interpretation of the
[1:14:12] word and how we hear from all over the
[1:14:14] world
[1:14:15] around the world. Now this the church is
[1:14:18] predestinated universally everywhere. Be
[1:14:21] two in the bed, two in the field. See,
[1:14:24] take one and leave one. Now,
[1:14:27] as I have done the work of an
[1:14:30] evangelist,
[1:14:32] and here's my plea. If that is pleasing
[1:14:35] to God and I've done the work all right,
[1:14:38] trusting that I have pleased him, asking
[1:14:40] forgiveness for all my mistakes,
[1:14:43] then he may be calling me from the field
[1:14:47] of evangelism
[1:14:48] to be his prophet.
[1:14:51] Then if it is, I'll leave evangelism.
[1:14:55] But if he calls me to be a prophet, I
[1:14:58] cannot be an evangelist.
[1:15:01] If I'm to be a bangist, I cannot be a
[1:15:04] prophet.
[1:15:06] I'm mixing the two offices. That's where
[1:15:08] I've always fussed about. Standing on
[1:15:11] the platform. It's never been good
[1:15:13] successful. God has used it, but I've
[1:15:16] never thought it was his direct will.
[1:15:18] It's been his permissive will. Stand on
[1:15:20] the platform. A vision or two will knock
[1:15:23] you out almost. See? And then if you
[1:15:27] tell this person how to straighten
[1:15:29] himself up and what to do and then the
[1:15:31] next person stands there, he's expecting
[1:15:34] the same thing and you can't tell him
[1:15:36] unless something tells you to tell him.
[1:15:38] And then the other people feel like
[1:15:40] you're a traitor or
[1:15:45] a demon something
[1:15:48] because you don't tell them what they
[1:15:50] want to know. See, that's not the
[1:15:52] office. the way of a prophet.
[1:15:57] Musicians, if you'll come
[1:16:02] now,
[1:16:03] let me for the next couple moments
[1:16:07] say that if you'll begin to look at this
[1:16:10] and follow the train of thought as the
[1:16:13] prophet of God goes along. In paragraph
[1:16:16] four, he talks about the leadership of
[1:16:18] man. God has always used the leadership
[1:16:21] of man. So he establishes a pattern.
[1:16:25] Then he goes to paragraph six. He says,
[1:16:27] "Now Satan's trying to get rid of the
[1:16:30] ministry."
[1:16:32] You get that? God lays down a pattern.
[1:16:35] Satan wants to destroy the ministry.
[1:16:37] Why? Look at here. All these brethren,
[1:16:39] watch this. This brother got in a car
[1:16:41] wreck. This one over here, this and
[1:16:43] that. He said, "Satan trying to get rid
[1:16:45] of the ministry."
[1:16:47] Paragraph 19, he says,
[1:16:53] uh, I kept my name on the church.
[1:16:56] He says, you know, they even tried to
[1:16:59] take the church out from underneath me.
[1:17:03] Actually wanted to vote Brother Brenam
[1:17:04] out, but because his name was on the
[1:17:07] title, right?
[1:17:10] So, you don't think he went through some
[1:17:12] issues himself? This was his own church.
[1:17:16] They would have voted him out. They
[1:17:18] would have taken it over. Brother
[1:17:19] Brenham says it right there on tape.
[1:17:29] He says, now the reason that I keep my
[1:17:31] name here on it, he said, even though
[1:17:33] you've got brother Neville here, he
[1:17:35] says, I just kind of stay in the
[1:17:37] background overseer because he says,
[1:17:39] I've I've got interest in this. I've
[1:17:43] started this. I want to make sure that
[1:17:46] it goes right. And if somebody comes in
[1:17:48] here with it's some kind of doctrine, I
[1:17:50] want to come in here and I want to
[1:17:51] straighten it. You guys are hear him
[1:17:53] saying it on tape.
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:01] Then in paragraph 26 he says Paul went
[1:18:04] out and established a church. He went
[1:18:07] out and got convert converts and he
[1:18:09] started a church.
[1:18:13] Paragraph 35,
[1:18:20] excuse me, back on paragraph 26, he
[1:18:23] says, "Now I go out and other ministers
[1:18:27] go out and have great meetings, get
[1:18:29] converts, and nowhere to put them.
[1:18:32] No church that has been established that
[1:18:36] I can send them to." Now, Brother
[1:18:39] Brennham says, "If you do not think that
[1:18:41] I believe in going to church," he said,
[1:18:44] "I've sent over 750,000
[1:18:47] of my converts to the Pentecostal
[1:18:50] Church, Assembly of God. It's on tape."
[1:18:55] He said, "I believe in going to church."
[1:18:58] Or I said, "I would have been a
[1:18:59] hypocrite to send him somewhere that I
[1:19:02] don't believe in going to church."
[1:19:06] So in paragraph 35, brother Brennan
[1:19:08] makes a statement. Well, maybe I've laid
[1:19:12] a platform, a foundation for that great
[1:19:15] prophet to come on the scene. You see,
[1:19:18] there's where different ones said,
[1:19:20] "Yeah, that that's me. He's laying the
[1:19:22] foundation. I'm the one." Because
[1:19:25] brother Brennham, even as John the
[1:19:26] Baptist said, there's one coming after
[1:19:28] me
[1:19:30] whose shoes I'm not worthy to unloose.
[1:19:35] Well, brother Renham said, 'If I'm not
[1:19:38] the one, there's another one coming
[1:19:40] after me. Who was it? The revealing of
[1:19:43] the son of man. So, was it a ministry of
[1:19:46] a man? Yeah, but the son of man. You see
[1:19:49] that?
[1:19:52] Paragraph
[1:19:53] 38, he says, "If we have nowhere to send
[1:19:57] them, what'll happen? They'll go right
[1:19:59] back." because he says, you know,
[1:20:01] they'll just filter right back into the
[1:20:04] same thing that they come out of.
[1:20:07] No church to go to.
[1:20:14] He says, why lay members would get so
[1:20:17] moved of God, they would go and start a
[1:20:21] church somewhere
[1:20:23] because there was a fire burning within
[1:20:25] their hearts.
[1:20:28] Paragraph 44, God put it on my heart
[1:20:33] to build a church. Brother Bram is
[1:20:36] talking about that. Here he is
[1:20:39] in 1933 as John the Baptist.
[1:20:44] And yet God's telling him, "Go build a
[1:20:46] church
[1:20:47] because you can go out here, get all
[1:20:49] these converts, but you have nowhere to
[1:20:51] send them." Do you think Brother Brennan
[1:20:54] believed in going to church?
[1:20:56] Yes, he did.
[1:21:01] Now, he says um in paragraph 61.
[1:21:10] Maybe it's the end of my road.
[1:21:12] Maybe I'm going off the scene.
[1:21:15] He said, "There's one of three things
[1:21:18] that can happen to me." He's very
[1:21:20] transparent.
[1:21:22] He's letting you know, listen, those
[1:21:24] people are not Amen. Glory to God.
[1:21:27] Hallelujah. They're not standing up and
[1:21:29] getting all excited. They're listening
[1:21:30] very carefully. He says, "Now, I'm I" He
[1:21:34] hasn't even taken a scripture and
[1:21:36] started to preach yet. He said, "I want
[1:21:38] to talk to you privately."
[1:21:40] He's got his little family there. He
[1:21:43] said, "Now, one of three things."
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:50] He says, "Maybe I'm laying the
[1:21:51] foundation
[1:21:53] for another one to come after me."
[1:21:58] He says, "Now, if I have on paragraph
[1:22:00] 70, if I have done the work of an
[1:22:02] evangelist,
[1:22:04] here's my plea.
[1:22:06] If it's pleasing to God and I've done
[1:22:08] that work, all right, trusting that I've
[1:22:11] pleased him. Asking forgiveness for my
[1:22:14] mistakes.
[1:22:16] That's hard for some people to even
[1:22:19] allow Brother Brenham to say that.
[1:22:23] Brother Brennham also said,
[1:22:26] "I've shown to you by the scriptures
[1:22:29] that every prophet,
[1:22:31] every man of God makes their mistakes,
[1:22:34] but God makes no mistakes."
[1:22:38] See what I'm saying?
[1:22:43] He says,
[1:22:45] "Uh, then he may be calling me from
[1:22:49] evangelism to be his prophet. Then if it
[1:22:51] is, I'll leave evangel and he calls me a
[1:22:55] prophet. I cannot be an evangelist. If
[1:22:57] I'm an evangelist, I can't be a prophet.
[1:22:59] It's mixing the two offices. It's what
[1:23:02] I've always fussed about.
[1:23:05] Standing at a platform, never been good
[1:23:08] or successful. Are you kidding me?
[1:23:14] Never been good and successful.
[1:23:16] you sister over here. You're just
[1:23:19] praying about this. God showed me. Stand
[1:23:21] up. God just healed you. Yes. Are you
[1:23:23] over here like this? And people My
[1:23:27] Hallelujah. Praise God. Stand up, sir.
[1:23:30] God just healed you of cancer. On never
[1:23:34] been successful. It's what I've always
[1:23:36] fussed about. And he says, and this
[1:23:38] discernment comes to me. He says, you
[1:23:40] give one, thus sayith the Lord. Tell
[1:23:42] them what's wrong with them. Tell them
[1:23:44] this and that. and the next one come up
[1:23:46] and unless God shows you you can't and
[1:23:48] they think you're a hypocrite.
[1:23:51] Well, see, look, he calls himself a
[1:23:54] prophet. He ain't no prophet. If he did,
[1:23:56] he'd tell me what was wrong. But he
[1:23:58] can't. See, brother Bren being very,
[1:24:00] very transparent for us. Saints of God,
[1:24:03] this message
[1:24:06] when you get into it, you see my He
[1:24:09] says, "Now I've mixed this." He says,
[1:24:12] "I've never felt it to be successful.
[1:24:15] It's been God's permissive will."
[1:24:19] But remember now his doctrinal teaching.
[1:24:22] He's going to take and use that
[1:24:26] to bring you into the perfect will.
[1:24:30] He's going to have visions, dreams,
[1:24:34] prophecies, things coming to pass, but
[1:24:37] he don't understand it. Why do you think
[1:24:39] he goes to Sabino Canyon?
[1:24:42] Why do you think he goes up there
[1:24:44] praying?
[1:24:47] We all think that he knew everything and
[1:24:49] God shown him everything and and he was
[1:24:51] never nervous and it was all going to be
[1:24:54] okay and but he goes up there, okay
[1:24:57] Lord, if you're taking me off the scene,
[1:24:59] that's fine.
[1:25:01] And
[1:25:04] sword hits his hand. This is the third
[1:25:07] pull. This is not the end of your
[1:25:10] ministry. It's the vindication of it.
[1:25:13] What? What?
[1:25:16] This is the vindication when he has been
[1:25:19] at the apex
[1:25:21] of his ministry.
[1:25:24] And he's coming to the time of the
[1:25:25] opening of the seals. And even after the
[1:25:27] seals, do you know doors are closing for
[1:25:30] him around the world. Does he go back
[1:25:34] into world evangelism?
[1:25:36] Does he go back and have great revivals?
[1:25:38] And no, he doesn't. He He goes back to
[1:25:42] Jeffersonville and he preaches and he
[1:25:46] stores up food.
[1:25:49] He says, "Go back home." He says, "I
[1:25:51] can't preach these things out there."
[1:25:55] How many of you are thankful you got
[1:25:58] spiritual food stored up in due season?
[1:26:02] Thank God we can go back to the tapes
[1:26:04] and hear what he said because I'll tell
[1:26:06] you what, there's so many
[1:26:07] interpretation. He said this and he said
[1:26:09] that. I ain't going to church while he
[1:26:11] just said, you know, do this and that
[1:26:13] and and hey, but we can go back. We can
[1:26:18] hear what he said. Amen.
[1:26:21] That's why he said, "Say what I say on
[1:26:24] those tapes." God bless you all this
[1:26:26] evening. Thank you for coming out to the
[1:26:30] house of God tonight. We're going to go
[1:26:33] on continue on. Hallelujah. Until he
[1:26:37] comes.
[1:26:38] Let's stand together. I appreciate all
[1:26:41] of you. We will continue. You brothers,
[1:26:44] mark that down. I think we stopped at
[1:26:45] paragraph 71. We'll mark that down and
[1:26:48] we'll start next time. carry on because
[1:26:50] you know he continues explaining a
[1:26:53] little bit more about the change of his
[1:26:56] ministry.
[1:26:58] He said I you know world evangelism
[1:27:00] evangelist prophet I can't mix it
[1:27:03] permissive will I want to go into his
[1:27:05] perfect will.
[1:27:07] Praise the Lord. God's
[1:27:10] so good to let us know these things so
[1:27:13] that we can get in here and we can say
[1:27:15] okay I see exactly what he's doing. He's
[1:27:19] he's wrestling even within himself. What
[1:27:23] does this vision mean? This blast. Am I
[1:27:27] going to die?
[1:27:29] Got his hand up in Sabino Canyon. Lord,
[1:27:32] what do you mean?
[1:27:34] No man can live through that.
[1:27:37] And he said something struck my hand.
[1:27:41] He said, "It's the not a king's sword.
[1:27:45] It's the king's sword." Amen. Amen. God
[1:27:47] bless you all this evening. What is the
[1:27:49] name of this song? He became me. Yeah,
[1:27:52] you go ahead and start it there, brother
[1:27:53] Greg. Thank you, brother John, for that
[1:27:56] song you sang tonight. God bless you. So
[1:27:59] that I might become him by grace.
[1:28:06] [Music]
[1:28:09] He became me
[1:28:13] so that I might become him by grace.
[1:28:24] And he
[1:28:26] took my place
[1:28:28] so that I
[1:28:31] by his love could take his.
[1:28:39] Yes, he became me
[1:28:43] so that I might become him by grace.
[1:28:51] Heavenly Father, we thank you, Father,
[1:28:54] that
[1:28:55] we sat here tonight.
[1:28:58] Sometimes people wonder, well, what did
[1:29:01] brother Brennham mean? What what about
[1:29:04] this change? What about change of
[1:29:05] administration? What's what's going on?
[1:29:08] What about this tent? What about this
[1:29:10] third pole? What about all of these
[1:29:13] things? But father, if we just go and
[1:29:16] listen
[1:29:19] and we let him explain it, it becomes so
[1:29:22] simple and so easy to understand.
[1:29:25] Father, because God is revealed
[1:29:30] in simplicity.
[1:29:32] Oh God, I pray keep us simple and yet
[1:29:36] let us have not carnal minds, not minds
[1:29:39] that try to figure it out, but to be
[1:29:43] spiritually minded
[1:29:45] that we might understand the very things
[1:29:48] of what you're wanting us to understand
[1:29:51] and to live by. We thank you and we
[1:29:54] praise you. I ask that you be with each
[1:29:57] and every one, Lord. And if you come
[1:30:00] before morning,
[1:30:02] take us with you, Lord.
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:07] Take us with you. Come quickly, Lord.
[1:30:10] Darkness, gross darkness is upon the
[1:30:13] earth. It seems like every time you look
[1:30:15] in the the the news and you see the
[1:30:18] headlines, we see Israel at war. We see
[1:30:22] Iran trying to to kill the Jews.
[1:30:27] And we we see
[1:30:29] President Trump trying to back Israel
[1:30:35] and then Iron saying if they do it's
[1:30:37] going to enter a world war. The Bible
[1:30:40] says there'll be wars and rumors of
[1:30:42] wars. But when you begin to see these
[1:30:44] things, look up
[1:30:47] for your redemption drawth nigh. Lord,
[1:30:51] we're right in the midst of all of this
[1:30:53] chaos and confusion and people darkness,
[1:30:57] not knowing who they are, where they
[1:30:59] come from, but there is a bride who has
[1:31:02] had their eyes open. They've caught the
[1:31:05] quickening of the spirit. They've heard
[1:31:08] what the spirit is saying to the church.
[1:31:10] I thank you. I praise you. Bless your
[1:31:12] people as we go our ways. bring us back
[1:31:15] here Sunday, Lord, refreshed, ready to
[1:31:19] hear another word from you. I thank you.
[1:31:21] I praise you in Jesus Christ's name.

[1:31:47] by his love could take his.

[1:33:12] that song, soften my heart with oil.
