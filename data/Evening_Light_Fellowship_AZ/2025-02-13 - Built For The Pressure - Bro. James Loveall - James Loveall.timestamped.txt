[31:37] Father Lord we have gathered on this
[31:39] Wednesday
[31:41] night Lord we didn't come to hear man
[31:44] but father we've come to hear from
[31:48] you and we're just asking now father by
[31:52] the foolishness of preaching with Lord
[31:56] you come by our way once again would you
[31:58] minister to lives would you walk the
[32:00] aisles Lord we're a needy people and but
[32:03] father you're so great and you're so
[32:05] mighty and you will meet every need that
[32:07] we have Lord You're an ontime god you're
[32:10] an everpresent help in the time of
[32:12] trouble and so father once again would
[32:15] you come by our way and break the bread
[32:17] of life to us we just Commit This
[32:20] Service as time into your hands Lord
[32:23] we'll be sure to give you the honor the
[32:25] praise and the glory in Jes Jesus
[32:28] precious name amen and amen if you have
[32:33] your
[32:36] Bibles we're going to turn to Proverbs
[32:39] 24 and verse
[32:42] 10 then we're going to turn to Psalms
[32:46] 91 Psalms
[32:49] 91 I just have a simple thought this
[32:53] evening and something that we can be put
[32:55] in remembrance of and we trust that they
[32:58] would encourage you and as I begin
[33:01] to this past week I begin to go and just
[33:05] listen to the prophet of the god you
[33:06] know and I began to listen to the series
[33:10] that he would preach or it's not
[33:11] necessarily series but he would preach
[33:12] several times letting off the
[33:15] pressure and as I begin to just listen
[33:17] to it it just something began and I
[33:20] begin to dissect it and just listen to
[33:22] different parts and so we just trust we
[33:23] can say something this
[33:25] evening so let's start over here in
[33:27] Proverbs 24
[33:29] And1 and it says if thou faint in the
[33:32] day of adversity thy strength is
[33:36] small if thou faint in the day of
[33:39] adversity and we see this word adversity
[33:41] it refers to a time of hardship a time
[33:43] of difficulty a time of trouble a time
[33:46] of
[33:49] pressure but I want you to understand
[33:51] that your strength will never be enough
[33:54] Amen in a time of adversity and hardship
[33:57] and trials and temptations your strength
[33:59] will never be
[34:03] enough but his strength his strength is
[34:07] always
[34:08] sufficient
[34:10] amen and let's turn over to Psalms
[34:15] 91 Psalms 91 and verse
[34:20] one he that dwelleth in the secret place
[34:23] of the most high shall abide under the
[34:25] shadows of the almighty amen
[34:28] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[34:30] in my Fortress my God in him will I
[34:34] trust surely he shall deliver thee from
[34:37] the snares of the fer and from the
[34:39] noisome pestilence amen he shall cover
[34:42] thee with his feathers and under his
[34:44] wings shalt thou trust his truth shall
[34:47] be thy shield and thy
[34:49] Buckle Thou shalt not be afraid for the
[34:52] terror by night nor the arrow that flyth
[34:55] by day nor the for the pestilence that
[34:57] walk WTH in darkness nor the destruction
[35:00] that
[35:00] w at noon day A thousand shall fall at
[35:05] thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand
[35:07] but it shall not come nigh
[35:10] thee only in thine eyes shalt thou
[35:13] behold and see the reward of the wicked
[35:17] you understand what he's saying is you
[35:18] will be only be able to see with your
[35:20] eyes everything Satan is only going to

[36:02] over thee to keep thee and all thy ways
[36:06] thank thank you
[36:08] Lord so this evening for a subject we'd
[36:11] like to title it built for the pressure
[36:15] built for pressure with the subject of
[36:18] there is a place of Refuge there is a
[36:21] place of refuge and as we begin to build
[36:24] this here everyone is under pressure y
[36:28] everybody is under pressure yes sir do
[36:31] me a favor take a big breath in and let
[36:34] it out one more
[36:37] time a that feel good amen don't go to
[36:40] sleep on me now but you see everybody is
[36:43] under pressure
[36:46] right this world is under pressure
[36:49] pressure has no boundaries it has no
[36:51] limits it has no limitations it it
[36:54] doesn't matter if you're a Believer if
[36:55] you're an unbeliever it don't matter if
[36:57] you're young or you're old it don't
[36:59] matter what age you are it don't matter
[37:01] if you're rich or if you're poor it can
[37:04] go from the pastor to the deacons to a
[37:07] to a position in the church it can go to
[37:09] the Ley it can go to the children
[37:11] everybody is under pressure different
[37:14] forms of pre pressure different kinds
[37:17] and it doesn't matter the stage of life
[37:19] that you're in but pressure comes in
[37:21] different forms right you can have
[37:25] Financial pressure but sickness pressure
[37:29] high blood pressure low blood pressure
[37:32] yeah no blood
[37:34] pressure there's all kinds of pressure
[37:37] in this
[37:41] world and pressure reveals a lot about a
[37:44] person when they get put under that
[37:47] pressure that's right it reveals a lot
[37:49] about that
[37:51] person you have peer pressure within
[37:53] this
[37:54] world trying to fit in or they they they
[37:57] force you into something I can't say he
[38:00] forced me into it but Justin lava he got
[38:02] me to run a half marathon this coming
[38:04] Saturday and I just trust I can get
[38:07] through
[38:10] it but
[38:13] pressure let me say this about pressure
[38:15] it don't matter how much you practice
[38:18] something it's until you get put under
[38:20] that pressure it's going to manifest
[38:22] everything about you you can take
[38:24] professional athletes and they can hit
[38:26] the same shot time and time again on a
[38:28] golf course or or in a batting cage or
[38:30] take a you know a practice free throw
[38:33] and you can shoot in the gym all day
[38:35] long and hit that but whenever the
[38:37] pressure comes and the game is on the
[38:40] line why is it they miss why is it they
[38:43] fail
[38:49] pressure kids are under
[38:52] pressure kids can be under pressure
[38:54] through their parents and wanting them
[38:55] to succeed and to meet need an
[38:58] expectation I've watched it many of
[39:00] times kids in in in certain Sports and
[39:02] they have to live up to their dad's
[39:04] expectation and he takes away the whole
[39:06] Joy of playing the game why because
[39:08] they're trying to live up to that
[39:10] pressure that expectation teenagers
[39:13] Under Pressure trying to to to find
[39:20] themselves husbands Under Pressure to
[39:24] provide to lead by example wives and
[39:27] raising their
[39:28] kids being supportive many times we put
[39:32] ourselves under this
[39:35] pressure and and instead of allowing
[39:38] things just to happen instead of just
[39:40] living life and allowing things to come
[39:42] to as they may and and just walking the
[39:45] Christian Life we we put these pressures
[39:47] and these expectations upon
[39:52] ourselves now maybe maybe you're all
[39:55] perfect and you don't you don't battle
[39:57] with this pressure so I'm going to
[39:59] preach to myself a little bit because I
[40:01] deal with
[40:02] pressure go I'm under pressure you know
[40:06] and it's all in how you handle that
[40:07] pressure when I begin to you know first
[40:09] started preaching and and I was always
[40:11] nervous when brother Ron would send that
[40:13] text and you're waiting around you don't
[40:14] know when you're going to get it and you
[40:16] would sit there because you know why you
[40:18] would sit there as a young Minister and
[40:19] I'm still young in
[40:21] Ministry but you see you sit there and I
[40:24] would I would wonder what am I going to
[40:25] say and how am I going to say it and
[40:27] what's going going to come to me how am
[40:28] I how am I going to put this together
[40:30] but when you realize that it's not you
[40:33] when you realize that as you walk in
[40:34] your Christian Life is you don't have to
[40:36] think about what am I going to do and
[40:38] how am I going to act and how am I going
[40:40] to live no whenever you give
[40:41] yourselfself to Christ you just begin to
[40:44] live it
[40:49] out
[40:52] true many times we don't sensitize
[40:55] ourselves and the pressure begin begin
[40:57] to
[41:01] build as I said brother Brandon would
[41:04] preach us many of times and if he would
[41:06] preach us back in 1963 and I believe
[41:08] there was several others within those
[41:10] similar years that he would begin to
[41:12] preach how much more is the pressure 50
[41:14] years down the
[41:21] road what is it Satan's trying to do
[41:24] this through the Avenue of pressure
[41:27] and many times we don't realize it that
[41:30] people will act out out of turn and we
[41:34] don't realize that we're here at the
[41:36] house of God and maybe you you have a
[41:39] you know brother Greg walks past me he
[41:40] doesn't even he doesn't even acknowledge
[41:42] me and then we I get offended because
[41:44] brother Greg didn't acknowledge me but
[41:46] yet I don't know the pressure he's going
[41:48] through I don't know the things that
[41:50] he's going through at home I don't know
[41:52] the work life that he's going
[41:55] through people under
[42:01] pressure and I looked it up what causes
[42:04] this pressure or what does it cause on
[42:05] the human body and when humans are under
[42:08] pressure they experience physical
[42:10] emotion and behavioral changes this is
[42:13] called the stress
[42:16] response yes sir physical symptoms would
[42:20] would would be increased heart rate or
[42:22] sweating nail biting butterflies of the
[42:24] stomach em emotional response would be
[42:27] fear anxiety anger feeling easily
[42:29] distracted underconfidence
[42:33] ain't that
[42:35] something you see that's what Satan's
[42:37] trying to get you to have fear a little
[42:40] anxiety a little worry feeling not
[42:43] confident in who you are and who God
[42:45] made you to be and who he called you to
[42:47] be that's
[42:50] right behavioral symptoms irritability
[42:54] tearfulness defensiveness flying off the
[42:56] hand being under characteristically
[42:59] aggressive you ever meet those type of
[43:06] people over aggressive overreact listen
[43:10] we're all human we all do
[43:15] it true you know some of these you can
[43:17] hide a lot easier than others but as I
[43:20] said whenever the pressure comes it's
[43:23] going to manifest
[43:27] and we understand that human nature
[43:29] always finds a way to escape pressure
[43:33] and try to run away from pressure and so
[43:36] what do we do we try to find Avenues to
[43:38] go down and the world if we took an
[43:40] example of them they would try to find
[43:42] it in a bottle or smoke smoke this or
[43:45] distract this
[43:50] way why because they're trying to escape
[43:53] the realities and the pressures of life
[43:56] amen
[43:59] right trying to get it away from these
[44:02] realities and if I can use the story
[44:04] that brother Brandon would he he would
[44:06] tell us about and we all know it of his
[44:08] Winchester
[44:10] rifle and how somebody would give him a
[44:12] Winchester rifle they gave it to Billy
[44:14] Paul and they gave it to him but he's a
[44:16] left-handed shooter and it's a bolt
[44:17] action so he couldn't use it so then
[44:19] brother brandham took it and one of his
[44:22] buddies says well we can make that into
[44:24] a weather bee and a weather be is a
[44:25] bigger you know and so they would have
[44:27] to bore that weatherbe or that
[44:29] Winchester to match that
[44:32] weatherbe right and so he sent it off to
[44:34] weatherbe and they rebore it and they
[44:36] got it back and what happened we know
[44:38] the story it blew up on him when he shot
[44:41] it and brother brand would use this
[44:43] example and he would say that's what
[44:45] happens when a Christian or a person
[44:47] tries to come to Christ and not they're
[44:49] not bore right they're not born again
[44:51] they don't come the right way and when
[44:53] they get put under the pressures of Life
[44:56] they blow up amen but then I begin to
[44:59] think that there's another type there
[45:01] because there's something in that
[45:03] there's situations that we go through
[45:05] and we try to force this God gave us
[45:08] this situation but we want to use it in
[45:10] a different way so we try to bore that
[45:13] situation to go this
[45:15] way good we try to bore it to make it
[45:18] work in our
[45:19] life but yet God didn't all lot that for
[45:22] us so what happens pressure comes it
[45:26] blows up your life will be
[45:28] spared God will spare your life he
[45:31] spared our prophet's
[45:33] life but yet it's an
[45:35] example I say God let us be in your
[45:38] perfect
[45:44] will built under this
[45:46] pressure you know even have it came to
[45:49] me that even in the fire
[45:52] service when you have a a pro let's say
[45:55] a propane tank and it's called C on fire
[45:58] and the gases are escaping it's very
[46:01] hard to put that fire out because the
[46:02] fumes are still coming out so what do
[46:04] you do is the temperature rises and
[46:07] their pressure within the gases begin to
[46:10] become gas and it begins to expand and
[46:13] that pressure what does it do it there
[46:15] there's a there's a Breaking Point amen
[46:17] there's an explosion point that if the
[46:19] temperature gets too hot what is it
[46:21] going to do it's going to
[46:23] explode so what do you have to do you
[46:25] have to take the water and you have to
[46:27] hit that tank and you have to minimize
[46:30] the temperature and you have to try to
[46:32] keep the temperature
[46:33] down you see that's what we're going to
[46:35] do tonight we're going to spray some of
[46:37] your tanks down some of them are at a
[46:40] boiling point that liquid's getting a
[46:42] little bit hot and it's burning real hot
[46:44] and ladyo seed is coming in hot but let
[46:46] me tell you let me spray some water of
[46:48] the Holy Ghost on you and cool you down
[46:51] a little bit and get you to relax and
[46:52] say it's all right let's let off the
[46:55] pressure
[46:57] amen thank
[47:00] you brother brandham says in letting off
[47:02] the pressure he says it's just becoming
[47:04] a neurotic age everybody's all built up
[47:08] having got no time and that builds up to
[47:11] a place that it breaks up things it
[47:14] causes people to have hard feelings when
[47:17] they snap them off and say things you
[47:19] don't mean mean to say now everybody is
[47:23] guilty of it I'm guilty of it you're all
[47:26] guilty of it
[47:29] yeah we're all guilty of it we're all
[47:33] guilty of
[47:36] it we do things under pressure that we
[47:39] wouldn't do otherwise so there's an e
[47:42] excess pressure built up today and he
[47:44] says before I go any further I say this
[47:47] I believe it's the enemy coming down and
[47:50] pressing I believe it's the devil amen I
[47:53] believe it's the devil so here he is
[47:55] identifying what pressure is it's the
[47:58] devil coming in trying to press down
[48:01] trying to cause you to say things and do
[48:03] things among one another in family
[48:05] members son to son to Father father or
[48:08] mother to daughter whatever it might
[48:11] be
[48:14] pressure
[48:19] conflict and we know the coming of the
[48:21] Lord is at hand and the Bible says in
[48:23] the last days that the devil would go
[48:25] out like a roaring lion and if he can
[48:27] get you under a pressure hurry and
[48:29] running over something you will make a
[48:31] decision that you wouldn't make if You'
[48:33] have sat down and thought it
[48:35] over
[48:37] right he's trying to make you to make a
[48:41] decision and you wouldn't have done
[48:43] otherwise if you would have sat down and
[48:45] thought it over a little
[48:47] bit and I was listening to the sermon
[48:50] today and brother brandom uses the
[48:52] example of him going hunting Colorado
[48:54] and they were riding some horses up the
[48:56] mountain with a a chief that was 10
[48:58] years younger than him and that they
[49:01] spotted some elk up on the
[49:04] mountain and brother brandham jumps off
[49:06] and takes off running after those elk
[49:09] Chief says slow down too fast too fast
[49:13] he says slow down brother BR said I I
[49:15] dropped it a gear he says too fast Slow
[49:18] Down slow down he says I begin to walk
[49:22] he says too fast Slow Down slow down
[49:26] yeah so he got down to just a slow pace
[49:30] and he's like and the chief told him
[49:32] preacher move too fast he says but the
[49:35] elk are up there chief he says but the
[49:38] YK they stay up there why because they
[49:40] were born
[49:42] there he says you need to do like the
[49:45] the the chief does walk them once look
[49:48] them nine
[49:50] times walk him once look him nine times
[49:53] too many times we're in a hurry we're
[49:55] going about life in a worry and we're
[49:57] making
[49:59] decisions Under
[50:06] Pressure he says there's two classes of
[50:10] people today he says may I say this
[50:12] there's men and women in the world
[50:14] brother rutle he says that really that
[50:16] they don't want to do the things they're
[50:18] doing there's men and women in the world
[50:20] today that don't want to sin and I feel
[50:22] sorry for them they want don't want to
[50:25] go out and do wrong but they do it
[50:27] they're drove to now there's a place for
[50:30] that person that wants to do right
[50:32] there's a place to let off the pressure
[50:35] it's true but there are some that they
[50:38] don't
[50:39] care you see there's two
[50:42] classes there's good people out there
[50:45] true that are looking for a refuge that
[50:47] are looking for a sanctuary looking for
[50:49] a place to let off the
[50:51] pressure then there's some that we've
[50:54] all met them they don't care
[50:57] they don't care if they cuss in your
[50:58] presence they don't acknowledge Christ
[51:00] they don't care about
[51:02] Christ by their own
[51:05] lips will they be justified and some
[51:08] will they be
[51:12] condemned but yet we know that God
[51:14] always makes a provided way amen we read
[51:18] in our Bibles and I won't go through
[51:21] these stories for we know them but we
[51:22] see ones who who have faltered under
[51:25] pressure and I'm not going to say failed
[51:27] Under Pressure because I I I I don't
[51:29] believe that they failed because we
[51:31] don't fail as Christians we might fall
[51:34] we might fall on our knees but let me
[51:35] tell you if you fall down get back up
[51:38] and if you fall get back up you're not
[51:40] failing as a Christian just because you
[51:42] make a mistake just because you you you
[51:44] slip up that doesn't mean you failed as
[51:46] a Christian it just means you faltered a
[51:48] little bit yes and whenever I read in my
[51:51] Bible I see men that have walked with
[51:53] God that talk with God and they fell
[51:56] down but then they got back up
[51:59] again you can take
[52:01] Peter who said I I won't deny Christ I
[52:06] that not me not me Lord but what did he
[52:09] do he denied he cured what about Jonah
[52:14] going in the wrong direction he chose he
[52:16] was going in this direction God told him
[52:18] go this way what did he do he tried to
[52:21] bore his own situation what happened it
[52:23] blew up on him
[52:26] yes sir Abraham
[52:30] lied the prophet was under such pressure
[52:33] in this day what
[52:34] happened he came to a place that he
[52:36] tried to take his own life under such
[52:40] pressure and if the prophet isn't exempt
[52:43] from it who
[52:44] is come on and the prophet came to such
[52:47] a place he was under so much
[52:51] pressure that he he he would listen to
[52:53] his mother-in-law and what happened
[52:57] he lost his wife and there he sat on the
[53:00] bed of his daughter dying Sharon Rose he
[53:02] says God you can take my wife but don't
[53:04] take my little
[53:06] girl don't do it can you imagine the
[53:08] pressure he was in you imagine the
[53:11] decision he would have made if he wasn't
[53:13] under that pressure I guarantee you it'
[53:15] had made a different
[53:17] choice but he was under such pressure
[53:20] what happened that's when Satan came
[53:22] down because whenever you're under
[53:23] pressure Satan's going to come cuz he's
[53:25] going to make you want to make a
[53:28] decision and when that pressure came
[53:30] down what happened Black Sheep came in
[53:33] front of him I thought you said he was a
[53:34] good God I thought you said he loved
[53:37] him let me tell you something when that
[53:39] pressure comes and Satan's in your ear
[53:41] let me tell you that's when the Anchor's
[53:43] going to hold that's when something's
[53:45] going to
[53:51] hold no matter the pressure that anchor
[53:55] holds Lord because you were built for
[53:59] the pressure so let us look here in the
[54:02] Old Testament in Joshua 20 if you could
[54:05] turn in your Bibles Joshua 20 and 1 but
[54:08] we know that the the Old Testament laws
[54:11] that they would live in was an eye for
[54:14] an eye and a tooth for a tooth and a
[54:16] burning for a burning that if you do
[54:18] something I have a right to do this and
[54:19] if you killed a man then you got to be
[54:22] killed and so we see that Joshua
[54:26] because God always makes a place of
[54:30] Refuge in Joshua 20 And1 he says and the
[54:33] Lord also spake unto Joshua saying speak
[54:36] to the children of Israel saying appoint
[54:39] out of you Cities of Refuge where of I
[54:42] spake unto you by the hand of Moses that
[54:45] the Slayer that kth any man unawares and
[54:48] unwittingly May flee thither and they
[54:51] shall be your Refuge from the Avenger of
[54:55] blood
[54:56] and when he doth flea unto those cities
[54:59] he shall stand at the end entering of
[55:02] the Gate of the city and shall declare
[55:04] his cause in the ears of the Elders of
[55:07] that City and they shall take into him
[55:10] into the city unto them and give him a
[55:13] place that he may dwell among
[55:16] them and if the Avenger of blood
[55:18] pursueth after him then they shall not
[55:22] deliver the Slayer into his hand because
[55:24] he smote his neighbor unwi
[55:26] willingly and hated him not beforehand
[55:30] you understand what's happening that if
[55:32] a man comes to one of these Cities of
[55:34] Refuge he said app point six cities that
[55:37] I'm going to make that if anyone would
[55:40] out of cause let's just say by accident
[55:42] and kill his neighbor or something maybe
[55:44] it was by an association that you were a
[55:46] part of maybe you went out with a buddy
[55:48] and and these two guys brother Brandon
[55:50] would dramatize this that you know you
[55:52] would go out and this man he would he
[55:54] was married had a wife and would go out
[55:57] and these two guys were like well can
[55:58] you take us to the store and they took
[56:00] him to the store and they robbed the
[56:02] store we if you've heard it and they
[56:04] robbed the store and now it's by
[56:07] association so now you're caught and now
[56:10] now you're on the run so you come to the
[56:11] City of
[56:13] Refuge seeking safety right in verse six
[56:17] and he shall dwell in that city until he
[56:19] stands before the congregation so first
[56:22] he must come to the entering of the gate
[56:24] and he'll plea his case before the
[56:26] elders and they will decide if he's just
[56:28] to come in or not then he's got to wait
[56:30] before and stand before the congregation
[56:33] for judgment until the death of the high
[56:35] priest that shall be in those days then
[56:38] he shall shall the Slayer return and
[56:41] come his own City and unto his own house
[56:44] and unto the city from whence he fled
[56:46] now notice here in these next uh verses
[56:49] of the places of Refuge because I
[56:52] believe that God is trying to tell us
[56:54] something here he appointed in Kadesh in
[56:58] the Mount of naptali and sheam in the
[57:00] Mount of Ephraim and and heam in the
[57:03] Mount of Judah so what is he saying here
[57:06] that there's mountains or these places
[57:08] of Refuge are in a high place they're in
[57:11] the mountains you can see them from afar
[57:13] off you don't put a place of Refuge down
[57:15] in the valley you don't put it in a
[57:17] place down in a low where there's
[57:20] flooding and things that would happen
[57:21] but you put a place of Refuge where
[57:23] people can see it from afar off
[57:27] and on the other side of Jordan so
[57:29] there's three and I'll show you a
[57:31] picture here in a minute but there's
[57:32] three on one side of Jordan and three on
[57:34] the other and they assigned and
[57:37] bezer in the wilderness upon the Plains
[57:41] and rth and Gilead out of the tribe of
[57:43] Judah and Gan and asan out of the tribe
[57:47] of Manasseh and so you see that these
[57:50] other places one is built in the
[57:53] wilderness and one the other two were up
[57:56] on on a a
[57:57] plateau to say and so we see here that
[58:00] the meanings and I begin to look up the
[58:02] meanings because I believe that God
[58:03] speaks to us in
[58:05] meanings that these places must have
[58:07] meanings and so we see that Kadesh means
[58:09] holy Shea means shoulder Hebron means to
[58:13] join or to bind and beaser means to a
[58:15] fortress or a stronghold rth means a
[58:18] high place and Goan means a joyful and
[58:21] so I began to look at these meanings and
[58:24] we're going to come back to these let's
[58:26] read verse 9 and these were the cities
[58:29] appointed for all the children of Israel
[58:32] and for the
[58:33] strangers and for the strangers that
[58:36] sojourned among them that whosoever kth
[58:39] any person at unawares might flee
[58:41] thither and not die by the hand of the
[58:43] Avenger of blood until he stood before
[58:47] the congregation so we see in this last
[58:49] scripture that it's just not for the
[58:52] Israelites it's not just for the
[58:55] Israelites
[58:56] it is for all that the sojourners among
[58:58] them let me tell you this message this
[59:00] Refuge isn't just for the message
[59:02] believer it's not for just those that
[59:05] believe it let me tell you there's some
[59:07] out there in the denominations listen
[59:10] there is a place of Refuge there's two
[59:12] classes of
[59:14] people ones that are willing and ones
[59:16] that are not but what it's saying is
[59:19] it's not just for the Israelites it's
[59:21] also for the sojourners
[59:26] yeah that's
[59:30] good there is a refuge for those of the
[59:34] Sinners that want to come into
[59:37] Christ give me the first picture there
[59:40] so there's six
[59:41] cities might be hard to
[59:44] see there's six cities that are spread
[59:47] out and the reason I wanted just to show
[59:49] this is because there's a strategy in
[59:51] which as I begin to look into it that
[59:53] that it was strategically placed
[59:55] throughout the
[59:56] land that of any person that would come
[1:00:00] under this cause or have a case against
[1:00:02] them they would be able to flee to one
[1:00:05] of these cities no matter where they
[1:00:06] were in the land that they could reach
[1:00:08] one of those cities within one day
[1:00:11] travel that there is a place of Refuge
[1:00:13] one day away from them that no matter
[1:00:15] where they were if they came under a
[1:00:17] circumstance if the devil was pressing
[1:00:19] on them there was a a way of Escape at
[1:00:22] least one day
[1:00:24] away and so we see that there was it it
[1:00:27] was placed there for a purpose and a
[1:00:30] reason let us read numbers
[1:00:36] 35 now I want us to remember that this
[1:00:39] person is going to come into the City
[1:00:41] and he's got to come before the elders
[1:00:43] but then he's going to come before the
[1:00:47] congregation and the then the
[1:00:49] congregation shall judge between the
[1:00:51] Slayer and the the Revenger of blood
[1:00:54] according to these judgments
[1:00:56] so he comes before the
[1:00:58] elders and they let him through and now
[1:01:01] he comes before the
[1:01:03] congregation now my wife was just had to
[1:01:05] go to jury duty we all have to if we get
[1:01:07] called it's our citizen
[1:01:10] obligation so it's an obligation of
[1:01:12] these this congregation to judge this
[1:01:15] man rightfully and when they come before
[1:01:18] and they bring this man before him and
[1:01:20] say I want you to judge this man just
[1:01:23] F now that this congregation is is going
[1:01:26] to look upon the man and they must judge
[1:01:28] according to what the law says and also
[1:01:31] the grace that they're willing to
[1:01:34] give this is the congregation he says
[1:01:38] and the congregation shall deliver the
[1:01:40] Slayer out of the hand of the Revenger
[1:01:42] of blood and the congregation shall
[1:01:45] restore him to the city of his Refuge
[1:01:48] he's it's not the elders restoring it's
[1:01:51] the congregation restoring are you
[1:01:54] understanding where I'm coming from that
[1:01:56] it is the congregation if I was to bring
[1:01:58] brother Greg before the people and I'm
[1:02:00] saying that Satan is coming against him
[1:02:02] and he is accusing him of him and he's
[1:02:04] telling them and he's bringing all these
[1:02:06] accusations let me tell you who is doing
[1:02:08] the restoration let's just bring it to
[1:02:10] our day cuz that's where I'm headed if
[1:02:13] who is a part of Christ and if Christ is
[1:02:15] the judge and the jury and he's one and
[1:02:18] you bring a person before the
[1:02:19] congregation who is doing the
[1:02:21] restoration it's the congregation giving
[1:02:24] the man to welcome him into the
[1:02:26] city and I trust you judge according to
[1:02:29] the grace that was given unto
[1:02:33] you yes
[1:02:35] sir that's good
[1:02:38] amen if Christ is our refuge and if
[1:02:41] you're a part of him who's helping him
[1:02:43] do the restoration
[1:02:46] today but if the Slayer shall at any
[1:02:49] time come out of the borders of the city
[1:02:52] whether he was fled and the Revenger of
[1:02:55] blood find them without the borders of
[1:02:57] the city of his refuge and the Revenger
[1:02:59] of the blood kth the Slayer he shall not
[1:03:02] be guilty of blood because he should
[1:03:05] have remained in the City of Refuge you
[1:03:09] see if you come within the city if you
[1:03:12] come within the city it's one thing to
[1:03:14] be accepted and you come into that City
[1:03:16] and you accept the Refuge there but you
[1:03:19] must abide there in the city because
[1:03:21] outside of the city the Revenger of
[1:03:23] blood is out there and Satan is out
[1:03:25] there seeking whom he may devour and if
[1:03:28] you come into Christ and Christ is our
[1:03:30] refuge listen outside of Christ is death
[1:03:33] outside of Christ there's there there's
[1:03:36] there's everything he's
[1:03:38] seeking yes sir he's trying to find ways
[1:03:41] to get you outside of that
[1:03:46] City you must remain within that City of
[1:03:52] Refuge and so these things shall be for
[1:03:54] a statue of judgment unto you throughout
[1:03:58] your generation and all your dwellings
[1:04:01] so we see here that these six cities
[1:04:04] that were given unto Moses and then
[1:04:06] Joshua implemented here that they would
[1:04:08] be six cities of as an example of God's
[1:04:11] provided
[1:04:13] place they were physical locations that
[1:04:15] the people can run to and remember I
[1:04:18] said that it was within one day of
[1:04:20] travel of no matter where you
[1:04:24] were and all these attributes as I begin
[1:04:27] to see and I begin to read into them and
[1:04:30] I begin to look them up and I begin to
[1:04:32] find scripture for them that all these
[1:04:34] attributes were wrapped up in one final
[1:04:36] attribute or one final
[1:04:40] Refuge because all these attributes are
[1:04:43] all tied up into the New Testament
[1:04:45] attribute or
[1:04:48] Refuge you see God came
[1:04:51] down on Mount
[1:04:54] Calvary as a place place of Refuge give
[1:04:57] me that picture and
[1:04:59] there he spread forth his hands he said
[1:05:02] it is finished and he gave his life that
[1:05:05] we might have a new testament Refuge to
[1:05:08] run to that no matter now it's not some
[1:05:10] City it's not some destination it's not
[1:05:13] some location it's not Jeffersonville or
[1:05:16] some headquarters that you got to go to
[1:05:18] no it's not a physical location but it's
[1:05:21] in Christ because when you're in Christ
[1:05:23] you have the Refuge
[1:05:27] all these attributes are wrapped up in
[1:05:32] Christ it's not the The Refuge of a
[1:05:35] church building it's not the Refuge of a
[1:05:37] pastor of a preacher or somebody no it's
[1:05:40] not in the The Refuge of your parents
[1:05:42] because listen people will fail and they
[1:05:44] will fall but let me tell you the Refuge
[1:05:46] is in
[1:05:50] Christ I begin to look in the new and
[1:05:53] the old scriptures of how the it was
[1:05:56] spoken of a coming Messiah and Kadesh
[1:05:58] means holy and 1 Peter 1:16 says but he
[1:06:02] that hath called you is Holy so be holy
[1:06:05] in all manner of conversation because it
[1:06:08] is written be holy for I am Holy shech
[1:06:12] means shoulder and I begin to this one I
[1:06:15] I was having a hard time with because I
[1:06:16] was like how do you correlate this one
[1:06:19] in but then I found the scripture of
[1:06:21] Isaiah 9:16 For unto us a child is born
[1:06:25] and unto us a son is given and the
[1:06:27] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:06:30] and his name shall be wonderful
[1:06:33] counseler the Mighty God the Everlasting
[1:06:35] father the Prince of Peace let me tell
[1:06:37] you in a time of trouble he's a good
[1:06:39] shoulder to put your head
[1:06:43] on he's an everpresent help in the time
[1:06:45] of
[1:06:49] trouble and in Luke 15 I I had to throw
[1:06:53] this one in here because it begin to
[1:06:55] talk about the parable of the lost sheep
[1:06:58] and how that the Good Shepherd would
[1:07:00] leave the 99 to go for the
[1:07:03] one and it says here in in Luke 15 and5
[1:07:07] and when he hath found the lost sheep he
[1:07:09] layeth his his he layeth it on his
[1:07:12] shoulder rejoicing and when he cometh
[1:07:15] home he called it together his friends
[1:07:17] and his neighbors saying unto them
[1:07:19] Rejoice with me for I have found my lost
[1:07:22] sheep which was lost and I say unto you
[1:07:26] that likewise Joy shall be in heaven
[1:07:28] over one sinner that repenteth more than
[1:07:30] 99 just persons which need no repentance
[1:07:35] one sinner want
[1:07:37] some let me tell you God the heavens are
[1:07:40] rejoicing when one sinner comes back to
[1:07:43] God over 99 needing no
[1:07:46] repentance I say God bring back the
[1:07:48] Sinners bring back those lost ones that
[1:07:50] are out in
[1:07:54] Wayward yes sir
[1:07:56] yes
[1:07:57] Lord Hebron was to join or to bind and
[1:08:00] in Psalms 147 and3 he heals the
[1:08:03] Brokenhearted and binds up their wounds
[1:08:06] baser means fortress stronghold rth
[1:08:09] meant high place Proverbs 18 and10 says
[1:08:12] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[1:08:14] and the righteous run into it and are
[1:08:16] saved Goan means
[1:08:20] joyful Nehemiah 8:10 says the joy of the
[1:08:24] lordu is my strength amen the joy of the
[1:08:28] Lord sometimes we need a little bit more
[1:08:31] joy I say Lord give us the joy of our
[1:08:34] Salvation when the pressure comes in
[1:08:36] like a flood and it's pressing down of a
[1:08:38] on us sometimes we just need a little
[1:08:40] bit of joy we need to get out of these
[1:08:42] things let me tell you something
[1:08:44] whenever you're going through a pressure
[1:08:45] time you just need a little bit of joy
[1:08:48] you know and you want sometimes you
[1:08:49] won't find that just you don't have to
[1:08:51] be fasting and praying sometimes it can
[1:08:54] come and and hiking going out hies
[1:08:56] talking with sister Marty on Sunday and
[1:08:58] now she just goes out and just hikes the
[1:09:01] the the trails to get along with God and
[1:09:03] talk to him what is she doing she's
[1:09:05] letting off the
[1:09:07] pressure sometimes letting off the
[1:09:08] pressure is finding something that you
[1:09:10] have enjoyment in maybe it's hunting
[1:09:12] maybe it's fishing maybe it's hiking
[1:09:14] maybe it's running I don't know what it
[1:09:15] is sometimes you just got to get alone
[1:09:17] with God and let off the
[1:09:24] pressure so 51 and12 restore unto me the
[1:09:27] joy of my salvation and uphold me with
[1:09:30] thy free
[1:09:33] spirit brother brandom says now I
[1:09:36] believe that a man coming to Christ and
[1:09:38] Christ is our refuge now he says that is
[1:09:41] the New Testament Refuge is Christ now a
[1:09:44] man coming to this Refuge must want to
[1:09:47] come and he must remember another thing
[1:09:50] he's got to stay there he's got to stay
[1:09:53] there oh my can't run in till the
[1:09:56] pursuer gets by and then go out again
[1:09:58] he's got to be satisfied that's what
[1:10:00] happens with a lot of people that come
[1:10:02] to Christ they come to Christ under a
[1:10:04] pressure and God delivers them from a
[1:10:06] certain circumstance and they come into
[1:10:08] Christ and they're happy and they're on
[1:10:09] fire with God and they get to a place
[1:10:11] and but yet they're not satisfied
[1:10:13] because they're waiting for the that
[1:10:15] that Avenger of blood to leave them and
[1:10:17] they think that Satan's left them in the
[1:10:19] past and then they step outside of the
[1:10:21] boundary they get outside the protection
[1:10:23] of the word but I say when you come to
[1:10:25] to Christ come completely in give all
[1:10:28] yourself to Christ Come Holy unto
[1:10:34] him when you come to Christ you must be
[1:10:37] satisfied let me tell you something I'm
[1:10:40] satisfied I'm satisfied and I'm happy to
[1:10:42] be a Christian I'm happy to be in the
[1:10:44] house of God I'm satisfied on a
[1:10:46] Wednesday night that I can come into the
[1:10:48] house of God and give him praise and
[1:10:51] give him
[1:10:53] worship God why because I've seen the
[1:10:57] evidence of God's goodness in our
[1:10:59] [Applause]
[1:11:01] lives I'm
[1:11:03] satisfied yes sir people in the world
[1:11:06] get their satisfaction from elsewhere
[1:11:08] they try to find it in in entertainment
[1:11:10] and all these different distractions but
[1:11:13] when you come to Christ let me tell you
[1:11:14] you should be
[1:11:21] satisfied and as long as he's in the
[1:11:24] refugees
[1:11:26] days and if he ever goes out again he's
[1:11:29] subject to the Slayer and in Christ we
[1:11:32] have a refuge and are
[1:11:34] secure that we have safety from the
[1:11:37] wrath of God and the wrath of hell that
[1:11:38] is coming Upon Us in that Refuge you're
[1:11:43] safe I say get in and stay
[1:11:46] in get in and stay in now's not a time
[1:11:48] to play around if you're not in get in
[1:11:51] because we don't have much time left
[1:11:54] that's right right get in and stay in
[1:11:56] stay satisfied with him because let me
[1:11:59] tell you when things begin to happen
[1:12:00] it's going to happen very rapidly it's
[1:12:03] going to be too
[1:12:05] late whenever the death angel was
[1:12:07] passing in the days of Moses and he was
[1:12:09] going through the land of Egypt and he
[1:12:11] said apply the blood apply the token
[1:12:13] over the doorpost I guarantee you there
[1:12:15] wasn't a lot lot of time left when that
[1:12:18] them black angels or the black he calls
[1:12:20] them the big black wings would begin to
[1:12:22] fly over Egypt there yeah and the fear
[1:12:26] would begin to sink into your
[1:12:28] body if you never applied the
[1:12:31] token if you never got right if you
[1:12:34] never took it
[1:12:38] serious and as that Death Angel would
[1:12:40] begin to fly brother Brandon would tell
[1:12:42] it he would say that Death Angel would
[1:12:44] begin to fly and he says I could see and
[1:12:46] this little boy was sitting next to his
[1:12:48] daddy and he says daddy that that that
[1:12:50] them angels are coming them wings are
[1:12:53] coming right come on and he says I can
[1:12:55] hear old Johnny's mother out in the
[1:12:57] street crying he's dead he's dead he
[1:13:00] says daddy he's coming for us next what
[1:13:03] are we going to do what are we going to
[1:13:05] do he said son I he he said to that old
[1:13:08] father he got his Bible and he put it
[1:13:10] down he took Johnny over to that
[1:13:12] doorpost or he took Junior to the
[1:13:14] doorpost he says you I want you to show
[1:13:16] you something he says you can let off
[1:13:18] the pressure why because I've applied
[1:13:20] the token I've put it over the house
[1:13:23] nothing's going to get us it's going to
[1:13:24] fly right past
[1:13:26] us yes sir glory to God I say each one
[1:13:30] of us each father each mother each young
[1:13:32] person should be able to say this
[1:13:34] evening that I've applied the to token
[1:13:37] over my life yes sir let me tell you if
[1:13:40] you get a gut feeling in your stomach
[1:13:42] this evening that you you're not sure
[1:13:44] you're uncertain now's now's not a time
[1:13:46] to play to question whether you do or
[1:13:49] you don't you better get
[1:13:52] in because when that those wings Begin
[1:13:54] to Fall let me tell you death and hell's
[1:13:56] going to follow
[1:13:58] him it's going to be too late
[1:14:04] then
[1:14:10] pressure when you've applied the token
[1:14:12] that pressure is
[1:14:14] off you can tell your first born that
[1:14:17] I've applied the token I've
[1:14:19] done Junior might ask well Daddy how do
[1:14:22] I know that it'll save me how do I know
[1:14:24] it's sufficient enough because it's his
[1:14:27] word it's his provided
[1:14:29] way yes sir listen Christ is his
[1:14:33] provided way this
[1:14:37] evening thank you
[1:14:44] Lord the prophet he would walk us down
[1:14:47] through
[1:14:50] time and he would begin to tell us about
[1:14:54] and show us the Evol ution or the the
[1:14:56] evolvement of man and he would begin to
[1:14:59] break it down
[1:15:00] into he would show us and talk to us
[1:15:02] about the the buggy age and he would say
[1:15:05] then we've moved on to the car
[1:15:07] age and we'd come up to the airplane age
[1:15:09] and you see these car and buggy they're
[1:15:13] Earthbound Vehicles they don't need to
[1:15:16] be
[1:15:17] pressurized they're not built for
[1:15:20] pressure they don't need to be
[1:15:22] pressurized you can roll down the window
[1:15:24] you can roll the up but whenever you get
[1:15:26] off the Earth these vehicles such as the
[1:15:30] airplane they got to become
[1:15:32] pressurized and so we see that as it
[1:15:35] begins to evolve it would get into the
[1:15:37] airplane but now the airplane can only
[1:15:39] take it so high there's limitations to
[1:15:43] that vehicle let's call it there's
[1:15:45] limitations on how high you can go that
[1:15:48] if it gets up so high that it would bust
[1:15:51] in half so there's limitations on that
[1:15:55] and we see that and I I looked it up
[1:15:57] that it was the maximum of a commercial
[1:15:59] flight can only go 42,000 ft in the air
[1:16:02] so everything has to stay below that
[1:16:05] limit and these are daily happenings
[1:16:08] people are going to and fro in their
[1:16:10] cars they're going to and fro in the
[1:16:12] airplanes these these are things that
[1:16:14] are happening all around us every day
[1:16:16] thousands and thousand times a day but
[1:16:19] the prophet would begin to take us into
[1:16:21] he would say we've gone further we've
[1:16:23] gone into the astronaut age and when we
[1:16:26] realize that the astronaut age is is
[1:16:28] something this vehicle is not built just
[1:16:30] for it's not going off every single day
[1:16:33] it's not just keep going and going and
[1:16:35] you just keep making it happen no what
[1:16:36] does the astronaut have to happen they
[1:16:40] there's a lot of preparation going into
[1:16:42] it yeah right the preparation is key to
[1:16:47] the journey you have to be you have to
[1:16:50] have the right kind of suit you have to
[1:16:51] have a pressurized suit you have to have
[1:16:53] a pressurized helmet you have to get
[1:16:55] ready because the pressures up there are
[1:16:57] unbearable so you have to get to a place
[1:17:00] that you can h stand the test and you
[1:17:02] can stand the pressure that's
[1:17:08] coming and you see that's what God is
[1:17:11] doing he's preparing you he's prepping
[1:17:15] you he's pressurizing you he says I'm
[1:17:18] not going to take the pressures from
[1:17:19] around you but what I'm going to do is
[1:17:21] I'm going to pressurize you from the
[1:17:22] inside I'm going to build you to stand
[1:17:25] the test of time I'm going to build you
[1:17:27] that whenever that time comes that in a
[1:17:29] moment and a twinkling of an eye when
[1:17:31] things are getting ready to go let me
[1:17:33] tell you you're going to be pressurized
[1:17:35] to stand the
[1:17:36] test you're going to be able to take
[1:17:39] this trip amen most of the time
[1:17:41] astronauts and all these ones they take
[1:17:43] how many trips one maybe
[1:17:45] two but most of the time it's a one-time
[1:17:48] trip let me tell you you're getting
[1:17:50] ready for a one-time trip you're getting
[1:17:53] ready for a one-time trip
[1:17:55] you better make sure that this thing is
[1:17:57] sealed because if you find any Nick or
[1:17:59] cranny or anything any lug nut any wash
[1:18:02] or anything that's off let me tell you
[1:18:04] it's going to explode but whenever
[1:18:05] you're ready and that thing is sealed
[1:18:07] let me tell
[1:18:13] you it's his provided
[1:18:16] way in the countdown he says the
[1:18:19] astronaut age we are living
[1:18:21] in in the astronaut age just as God has
[1:18:25] testified by natural happenings there
[1:18:27] and so he testified now that we're
[1:18:29] achieving an astronaut God has achieved
[1:18:32] what he promised to achieve in the last
[1:18:34] days according to Malachi 4 only thing
[1:18:37] he has to do is get somebody in his
[1:18:40] hands listen to this only thing he has
[1:18:42] to do is get somebody in his hands that
[1:18:44] can cut loose from them airplane and
[1:18:46] Automobiles and what more and not look
[1:18:48] back to what it was but more on the
[1:18:51] power to lift him higher lift him up
[1:18:54] into the Pres of God lift him up there
[1:18:56] where all things are possible now we see
[1:18:59] it's happening there is no doubt to it
[1:19:02] he needs a person to stop looking in the
[1:19:05] past stop looking in the Pentecostal age
[1:19:08] stop looking for emotions and all these
[1:19:10] things stop looking for Sensations back
[1:19:12] in the past we're trying to look up
[1:19:15] we're trying to look forward move
[1:19:16] forward sir he says if I can get one
[1:19:20] person
[1:19:22] on to cut loose
[1:19:26] I say Lord let me be one of them people
[1:19:28] I want to cut
[1:19:32] loose thank you Lord to get into the
[1:19:35] presence of God he says one of these
[1:19:37] mornings God's achievement of an
[1:19:40] astronaut that's climbed into Christ
[1:19:42] been born in there by the holy spirit
[1:19:45] filled with his power he says one of
[1:19:47] these mornings the whole universe will
[1:19:49] be screaming and wailing and nashing of
[1:19:51] teeth when they see they've missed it
[1:19:55] he says when the Great Eagle powered by
[1:19:56] the Holy Ghost in fire brings and
[1:19:59] spreads her wings the astronaut will
[1:20:02] take off into the sky and go to meet
[1:20:05] with the bridegroom and when the bride
[1:20:07] takes off and in the astronaut power of
[1:20:10] God Almighty he says who sent Jesus
[1:20:13] Christ to the Earth in the form of the
[1:20:15] Holy Ghost has brought the church
[1:20:17] through all these achievements she's
[1:20:19] progressed she's progressed from the
[1:20:21] automobile and and and from the airplane
[1:20:24] age and all these different things but
[1:20:26] we got to keep moving forward we got to
[1:20:28] keep moving higher we got to go into
[1:20:30] higher Heights and deeper
[1:20:35] depths until
[1:20:38] now she is getting resurrected power in
[1:20:42] her to fly beyond the things of the
[1:20:44] world seeing him in out there in the
[1:20:46] church making himself the same yesterday
[1:20:49] today and forever yes sir he says the
[1:20:51] countdown is even over every Church age
[1:20:54] has done past we're ending on the loud
[1:20:57] youa we're here brothers and
[1:21:02] sisters get in my brother my sister he
[1:21:05] says get pressurized the pressure won't
[1:21:08] hurt you when you've got inside and get
[1:21:11] pressurized get in Christ and you won't
[1:21:13] care what the world says they can't
[1:21:16] never hit you anyhow you're safe you're
[1:21:18] tucked in you see the journey is now the
[1:21:22] preparation is now the ceiling is now
[1:21:25] because whenever the Rapture takes place
[1:21:27] it's going to be in a moment and a
[1:21:28] twinkling of an ey but now the
[1:21:30] preparation is the most important thing
[1:21:33] getting in Christ is now making sure
[1:21:36] your calling an election is sure
[1:21:39] now praise the Lord God Amen how do we
[1:21:46] know how do we know whenever this
[1:21:49] time happens how do we know that we'll
[1:21:52] stand the test of time when that Rapture
[1:21:55] comes how do we know that we'll be
[1:21:56] pressurized why because his word says so
[1:21:59] now if I can say like the chief said he
[1:22:01] says how do I know that he was talking
[1:22:04] about the milk he said they live up
[1:22:05] there because they were born there let
[1:22:07] me tell you how do I know I'm going to
[1:22:08] live up there it's because I was born
[1:22:11] there it's because I came from God and
[1:22:13] I'm going back to
[1:22:15] God glory to God you were built for the
[1:22:19] pressures built for the trials built for
[1:22:22] these things of Life built for the chest
[1:22:26] yes it's why the Bible says buy of me
[1:22:28] gold tried in the fire why is it so
[1:22:31] tried and molded Under Pressure because
[1:22:34] it's the only thing that can stand that
[1:22:36] test of that heat and that pressure
[1:22:38] everything else when you go through
[1:22:39] trials and everything let me tell you
[1:22:41] everything's going to burn off and fall
[1:22:44] off absolutely Psalms 9 and9 says the
[1:22:48] Lord also will be a refuge for the
[1:22:50] oppressed a refuge in a time of trouble
[1:22:53] and they that Know Thy name will be put
[1:22:55] their trust in thee for thou Lord Hast
[1:22:58] not forsaken them that seek thee Psalms
[1:23:01] 46 And1 God is our refuge and a strength
[1:23:04] of very present help in the time of
[1:23:08] trouble praise the
[1:23:11] Lord yes sir letting off the pressure
[1:23:14] here he says the waves can beat and
[1:23:19] baffle sickness can come death can come
[1:23:23] or anything else
[1:23:25] but you're safe ever more amen Christ
[1:23:27] our refuge God provided place of
[1:23:32] safety Christ is the only place of
[1:23:34] safety for those that want to live he is
[1:23:38] the only one that has eternal life
[1:23:41] there's no church no denomination no
[1:23:43] president no King no Pope no Bishop no
[1:23:46] minister no nothing can give you safety
[1:23:49] but Christ Jesus that's why you can't
[1:23:52] put your Assurance in anything else
[1:23:55] but Christ the word he says he is the
[1:23:57] only provided place that can give you
[1:24:01] safety and he is God's provided
[1:24:06] safety musicians come oh we can provide
[1:24:10] this and provide that and it'll fall but
[1:24:13] when God provides anything it's Eternal
[1:24:17] and that's God's provided way of sa of
[1:24:19] our for our safety in Christ I love it
[1:24:23] he says when you're in him
[1:24:24] when Trouble Comes like sickness or
[1:24:27] worry or disappointments he bore our
[1:24:29] sorrows with his stripes we are healed
[1:24:32] everything that we have need of for the
[1:24:34] rest of the journey is right here in the
[1:24:37] Refuge so let me ask you this evening
[1:24:39] what do you have to worry what do you
[1:24:41] have to fear when you're in Christ you
[1:24:43] have
[1:24:45] everything
[1:24:47] hallu when you have Christ you're and
[1:24:50] you're in him you have all the answers
[1:24:52] why it's not why me this why this no no
[1:24:57] don't question just
[1:24:59] walk keep having faith
[1:25:02] [Music]
[1:25:07] believe we're living in an age
[1:25:11] that you see pressure is building
[1:25:15] up it's building
[1:25:17] up ah we're all humans we we make
[1:25:20] mistakes hey I'm guilty of it I snapped
[1:25:23] the other day
[1:25:26] it
[1:25:27] happens sometimes you just got to bring
[1:25:29] yourself
[1:25:30] into you know check yourself I'm sorry
[1:25:35] it was my fault I made a mistake this
[1:25:38] was over the phone and you
[1:25:39] know many times that's when I feel like
[1:25:42] a failure because you're supposed to
[1:25:44] live the life of Christ and you're
[1:25:45] supposed to be an example
[1:25:47] and then you're on the phone and you you
[1:25:50] blow up or you get an argument and
[1:25:55] but yet you know what we do we dust it
[1:25:57] off we get back up again uh these trials
[1:26:02] these mistakes these pressures of
[1:26:05] life these things we go
[1:26:07] through what is he doing is he's molding
[1:26:10] and he's making us thank you
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:21] Jesus you were built for the pressures
[1:26:25] yes many times we think we get to our
[1:26:28] Breaking Point ah you're not there you
[1:26:32] know I've been training for this couple
[1:26:35] weeks not much training for a half
[1:26:39] marathon but you begin to run and you
[1:26:41] know within the it's 13 point something
[1:26:44] miles
[1:26:46] and as I begin to run and I I don't even
[1:26:49] enjoy
[1:26:51] running I don't enjoy it
[1:26:56] but you know it's some sometimes it's
[1:26:58] good for us to do things that we don't
[1:27:00] enjoy it gets us out of our comfort zone
[1:27:02] to you know go out of the way and talk
[1:27:04] to somebody that you haven't talked to
[1:27:06] or have somebody over for dinner you
[1:27:08] know it allows you to get out of your
[1:27:10] comfort zone amen right so I begin to
[1:27:13] run and you know within every time I run
[1:27:16] within the first two miles I want to
[1:27:18] quit I want to give up I why would this
[1:27:21] isn't no fun this is what am I doing
[1:27:25] but you know what you
[1:27:26] do you tell yourself let me tell you
[1:27:29] something if you're going to quit quit
[1:27:32] tomorrow and when tomorrow comes quit
[1:27:35] tomorrow when tomorrow comes quit again
[1:27:39] quit tomorrow always quit the next day
[1:27:41] why because that means you're just going
[1:27:43] to keep going and you're going to keep
[1:27:45] [Music]
[1:27:47] going whenever you get out there and I
[1:27:49] was
[1:27:50] running you begin to realize and you put
[1:27:53] put on a sermon and after a while you
[1:27:55] just kind of put away the pressures of
[1:27:58] life and you begin to
[1:28:01] run you don't have any worries you don't
[1:28:03] have anything holding you
[1:28:06] down I begin to think Lord help me let
[1:28:09] this be a resemblance of my Christian
[1:28:11] walk let me run to gain the prize if
[1:28:14] we're going to run let us run to win let
[1:28:16] us strive let us not quit let us not be
[1:28:19] a a quick give in that whenever the
[1:28:21] pressures build up and things happen and
[1:28:24] it's so easy to throw in the
[1:28:26] towel husbands whenever you get an
[1:28:29] argument it's easy to snap off or maybe
[1:28:31] mothers with W with children it's so
[1:28:34] easy that the pressures and you're going
[1:28:36] through something and to identify what's
[1:28:40] happening that's all we got to do we got
[1:28:42] to expose the devil because the prophet
[1:28:45] of God told us it's Satan coming in
[1:28:47] trying to press on your lives he's
[1:28:48] trying to press down on your families
[1:28:50] he's trying to draw a conflict between
[1:28:52] you and your father you and your brother
[1:28:54] brother you between different
[1:28:56] ones
[1:29:00] pressures you know the thing about
[1:29:03] pressures you have an incident that
[1:29:05] blows up doesn't mean I don't love you
[1:29:07] but it just you you acted at a turn you
[1:29:10] allowed this boiling point to happen I
[1:29:12] say let us let off the
[1:29:15] pressure let us take a moment and just
[1:29:18] say God help me to come to a place that
[1:29:21] the cares of life and tries of life and
[1:29:23] I understand the pressures we all
[1:29:26] understand pressures Financial pressures
[1:29:28] maybe there's not enough money in your
[1:29:30] bank account maybe you've come to a
[1:29:32] place you see even with this races I
[1:29:34] begin to think there's a deadline coming
[1:29:36] and I know that this Saturday is a
[1:29:38] deadline and I'm going to have to run no
[1:29:40] matter
[1:29:42] what let me ask you if you knew the
[1:29:44] deadline or the end of your life how
[1:29:46] would you be living amen what kind of
[1:29:49] pressure would it put you under would
[1:29:51] you be have more Zeal toward God or
[1:29:53] would you be more more slacked and say
[1:29:55] you know what God you told me I have 10
[1:29:56] years so I'm going to just be a little
[1:29:58] bit more
[1:29:59] slacked but let me tell you that
[1:30:01] shouldn't be the case because when you
[1:30:03] come to Christ as I said you should be
[1:30:05] So Satisfied Hallelujah that you have no
[1:30:09] hungers of this world you have no
[1:30:10] desires of this world because he said
[1:30:13] the Bible says if you love the world or
[1:30:14] the things of the world Christ is not in
[1:30:18] you I say God help us amen let's stand
[1:30:24] you were built for the
[1:30:30] pressures let's just say a prayer
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:36] father letting off the
[1:30:41] pressures Lord if your Prophet would
[1:30:44] preach us several
[1:30:45] times and he'd say I go places and
[1:30:49] before I get into the pulpit I seek the
[1:30:51] mind of God and I would get out of the
[1:30:53] way and Lord what would you have for
[1:30:55] your people and he would sensitize
[1:30:58] himself and he would say and he came to
[1:31:00] the the pulpit there and he' say there's
[1:31:03] such a pressure I can feel the pressure
[1:31:06] of of people and the church and because
[1:31:08] there's no boundaries of
[1:31:12] pressure and of things we go through in
[1:31:15] Trials of
[1:31:17] life but he says if we can come to a
[1:31:19] place because in Christ is our
[1:31:22] refuge in Christ in him is our refuge
[1:31:26] and I'm so thankful Lord that you made a
[1:31:28] place of Refuge that we can come into
[1:31:31] Christ that we have access that it's not
[1:31:33] a place it's not a day away it's not a
[1:31:35] month away we don't have to travel
[1:31:37] somewhere but it's in Christ and we can
[1:31:39] access him 24/7 365 we can access him
[1:31:44] day we can ACC access him in the middle
[1:31:46] of the night Lord no matter what it is
[1:31:48] Lord you're always there you're ever
[1:31:51] presentent help in the time of trouble
[1:31:53] we're so thankful and we're blessed that
[1:31:55] you've called us you've elected us
[1:31:58] you've chosen us
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:01] Lord Lord and we're so thankful that you
[1:32:04] sent Lord your prophet in this
[1:32:07] day Lord I know it's not deep it's it's
[1:32:10] not something but father may it help the
[1:32:11] people in their everyday lives may they
[1:32:14] be able to apply it in their lives and
[1:32:15] expose the devil when a situation arises
[1:32:18] when something comes up and identify and
[1:32:20] say you know what maybe he's under a
[1:32:22] little bit of pressure I'm going to give
[1:32:23] him a pass I'm going to give him a break
[1:32:24] maybe I'll pray for him maybe I'll I'll
[1:32:26] say a prayer for
[1:32:30] him Lord help
[1:32:33] us help us
[1:32:36] Lord I ask a special blessing upon your
[1:32:38] people Lord I I know they're going

[1:32:42] and this the uncertainty of this this
[1:32:45] government and the direction of America

[1:32:50] it's under the shelter of your wings
[1:32:54] it's under the shelter of your wings
[1:32:56] lord it's not the strength of ourselves
[1:32:58] but it's the strength of
[1:33:00] you father how blessed we are to be able
[1:33:03] to call you father and to be able to
[1:33:05] call on your name that Lord as I said
[1:33:07] the these pressures aren't just for the
[1:33:10] believer but they're also the unbeliever
[1:33:12] but they don't have a place to go they
[1:33:14] don't have a place to go and let off the
[1:33:16] pressure but Lord we're so thankful we
[1:33:18] do that we can come into your house even
[1:33:21] into this

[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:33] pray
[1:49:35] Lord I'm so much more than
[1:49:43] satisfied satisfaction is not even
[1:49:47] enough to tell you how thankful
[1:49:55] I'm not just content Lord my cup rth
[1:49:58] over
[1:50:00] amen and when I feel like I got nothing
[1:50:03] left to give Lord there's an anchor that
[1:50:06] holds hallelujah thank you Lord and once
[1:50:10] again you just pass by and You Remind Me
[1:50:13] Lord that it's not my
[1:50:16] strength cuz certainly Lord I know I
[1:50:19] can't do it amen but Lord when I give
[1:50:22] everything
[1:50:23] yes all my thoughts all my
[1:50:26] ambitions all my ideas everything that I
[1:50:29] have when I give it to you and I place
[1:50:31] it at your feet Lord Lord you're more
[1:50:34] than
[1:50:35] able you've already
[1:50:38] provided sometimes you're just waiting
[1:50:40] for us to realize to
[1:50:43] recognize Lord we take it for granted
[1:50:45] sometimes Lord
[1:50:47] and sometimes the cares of this life
[1:50:50] they they seem to get get us all
[1:50:53] intertwined with just our emotions and
[1:50:56] feelings and stuff like that Lord but
[1:50:58] you're doing it to bring us to a place
[1:51:01] Lord there's a reason why you said
[1:51:03] consider the trials of your faith more
[1:51:05] precious than gold amen because it's in
[1:51:08] those times it's in that time where your
[1:51:11] Prophet said when Satan under such
[1:51:15] pressure says you say your God loves you
[1:51:18] and yet he leaves you alone in a time
[1:51:21] like this he don't hear your prayers and
[1:51:24] he said there was something that helped
[1:51:28] Hallelujah because Lord we can't curse
[1:51:30] you even when job got to that place he
[1:51:32] couldn't curse you
[1:51:34] why because you were part of him and he
[1:51:36] was a part of you from the very
[1:51:38] beginning Lorden thank you Lord and Lord
[1:51:41] we we I liked how brother James said it

[1:51:46] because it was born up there amen we
[1:51:50] were born up there Hallelujah returning
[1:51:52] back to there and all this other stuff
[1:51:55] is just meant to pressurize us thank you
[1:51:58] Lord help us Lord to not be in the horse
[1:52:00] and buggy days and to not just coast
[1:52:03] along Lord but help us to get more
[1:52:05] pressurized and if we're not going
[1:52:07] through it maybe we're not walking like
[1:52:10] we should because the pressure is
[1:52:13] something that you give us as a
[1:52:15] gift and we thank you for that we thank
[1:52:19] you Lord for the fine tuning of the holy
[1:52:20] spirit amen I pray that you would bless

[1:52:36] to be here and amen I liked how he even
[1:52:39] said that it was the people at the
[1:52:41] church it was the
[1:52:43] congregation that's beautiful help us
[1:52:46] Lord to be that kind of a congregation
[1:52:48] that when one of one of the your
[1:52:51] children or even somebody with that's
[1:52:53] outside the gates Lord like he said it
[1:52:56] might not even be a believer but just to
