[7:27] would come in a special way this
[7:28] evening, Lord, as your sons and your

[7:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you would have your

[7:39] in a special way, Lord. We pray.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; We love you. We just commit this service
[7:43] now into your hands.
[7:45] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; How many are glad to be in the house of
[7:50] the Lord tonight? Amen. It's good to be
[7:52] here in his presence. Before we go to
[7:54] the Lord in prayer, let's sing that
[7:55] chorus. Because he lives, I can face
[7:57] tomorrow. How many know that you serve a
[7:59] risen savior tonight? Amen.
[8:03] Because he lives,

[8:15] Because
[8:16] he lives,
[8:20] all fear is gone
[8:26] because
[8:27] I know,
[8:30] yes, I know he holds the future.

[9:19] This life is worth the living just
[9:25] because he lives.
[9:32] Amen. And we have a praise report
[9:33] tonight from our brother Jim. He says,
[9:35] "Sister Nancy
[9:37] has been shattering all expectations
[9:40] since her TE-C cell infusion on Monday.
[9:43] The next 3 to 5 days will be indicative
[9:45] of the type of side effects she may be
[9:47] dealing with. She sends her love to all
[9:50] and thanks each one for their prayer on
[9:52] her behalf." So, let's continue to
[9:54] remember Sister Nancy. The Lord be with
[9:55] her through this procedure and just
[9:57] grant her a full recovery. Know that
[9:59] he's more than able tonight. Amen. I
[10:02] want to remember sister Karen M. She's
[10:04] at home sick tonight. There's some
[10:07] others that are home sick. Our brother
[10:09] Eric Andress is quite sick. He's at home
[10:11] asking for prayer. The chewers are at
[10:13] home sick. Brother Steven said Ashlin is
[10:16] sick tonight as well. And brother Chris
[10:18] Roine, I'm sure there's others. How many
[10:19] would have a need tonight? You just want
[10:21] to lift it before the Lord. Brother Paul
[10:23] Maple, would you come tonight, brother
[10:24] Paul? And just take us before the Lord
[10:26] in prayer. Also ask you remember our
[10:29] little dog Popsy. May not seem like
[10:31] much, but he's been hobbling on three
[10:34] legs for the last few days. So believe
[10:36] nothing is too small.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; God honors our faith.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; How many of you need tonight? Just want
[10:44] to lift your hand.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Paul, if you'd come.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; How many are thankful to be here
[10:53] tonight?
[10:54] Thank you.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; You know, I was uh rushing from work,
[10:58] rushing home,
[11:01] &gt;&gt; trying to get here. You know, I wanted
[11:02] to get in here and try to get in the
[11:04] spirit and maybe drive a little faster
[11:07] than I should.
[11:10] And all of a sudden, I said a thought. I
[11:11] thought, God, why me?
[11:15] Why is it so important for me to be
[11:17] there tonight?
[11:20] I'm just so thankful that he called me.
[11:21] I said, "God, why do you call me that?"
[11:24] &gt;&gt; I don't put the hunger in my heart to be
[11:26] here. He does.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; I'm just so thankful for his mercy and
[11:29] grace.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember that service
[11:33] brother Steven had a attitude of
[11:36] gratitude.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; I appreciate all you guys that are here
[11:42] today,
[11:44] all my brothers and sisters in Christ.
[11:46] And you guys don't know how much it
[11:48] means to me to be able to come here and
[11:50] see you and the spirit that you bring
[11:52] and to fellowship with you and worship
[11:54] with you.
[11:56] It's a blessing
[11:58] &gt;&gt; and it's an honor and I appreciate every
[12:00] one of you and I want to make sure I let
[12:02] you guys know that. So, thank you so
[12:05] much for being here.
[12:09] Dear heavenly father, we're just come to
[12:11] you this evening, dear Lord.
[12:14] So thankful of your mercy and grace.
[12:16] We're thankful that you call us, dear
[12:18] Lord. For without you, where would we
[12:20] be, dear Lord, that song because you
[12:24] live, I can face tomorrow. That's true,
[12:26] dear Lord. The pressures and pulls of
[12:28] this world, dear Lord, they just
[12:30] consistently push down upon us. But dear
[12:32] Lord, you bring peace. You bring joy.
[12:33] You bring happiness. You bring a purpose
[12:35] in my life, dear Lord. That purpose is
[12:38] to serve you the best that I can, dear
[12:39] Lord, each and every day with all of my
[12:42] heart, dear Lord. That I know that's the
[12:44] desire of all of our hearts here, dear
[12:45] Lord, is to just to little live a little
[12:48] bit more like you.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; To walk a little bit more like you, to
[12:52] be a light, dear Lord, in this dark and
[12:54] perverse generation that we live in.
[12:56] Dear Lord, we know that you are almighty
[13:00] God and you know, dear Lord, the
[13:03] prayers, the desires of our hearts. I'm
[13:04] sure there's many unspoken requests,
[13:07] dear Lord, that are here this evening. I
[13:08] know I have some on my heart, dear Lord,
[13:10] and you know what they are.
[13:13] Dear Lord, before there is ever a desire
[13:15] in our heart, dear Lord, you already had
[13:17] the answers. So, we lift them up to you
[13:18] this evening, dear Lord, for all the
[13:19] sickness, dear Lord. We already know
[13:21] you've healed them, dear Lord, those
[13:25] that we love, dear Lord, you love as
[13:26] well. And we ask for dear Lord whether
[13:28] it be a family member, whether it be an
[13:29] animal, dear Lord. Whatever it might be,
[13:31] we bring them up to you and lift them up
[13:32] and say, "Dear Lord, would you heal them
[13:33] according to your word? Would you give
[13:35] us the faith, dear Lord, to rise up
[13:36] inside of us and claim those things
[13:38] which you've already promised, dear
[13:39] Lord? We're just so thankful to be here.
[13:41] We pray that you would just bring every
[13:45] spirit, dear Lord, every everybody under
[13:48] your subjection, dear Lord, this
[13:49] evening. Lord, cast out every worry,
[13:50] every fear, dear Lord, every thought of
[13:53] life, dear Lord, or work or just
[13:55] pressures that we have going on. May we
[13:56] just worship you this evening, dear
[13:58] Lord. We're just thankful to be here,
[14:00] dear Lord. We know it's by your grace
[14:01] and your grace alone. And dear Lord, I
[14:04] can just say with all my heart, I'm so
[14:05] thankful for your mercy, for your grace,
[14:07] and I love you.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Pray that you would just, dear Lord,
[14:11] just speak to the speak to the man this
[14:13] morning. Dear Lord, may we hear Christ,
[14:14] dear Lord, speak to us, dear Lord. And
[14:16] maybe we not just walk out saying,
[14:18] "Well, that was a good a good a good
[14:20] good service by this minister of that."
[14:22] that we may say that was Christ that
[14:23] came down and spoke to us this evening
[14:25] to tell us how to to walk. Tell us how
[14:28] to live. Dear Lord, prick our hearts,
[14:29] dear Lord. Give us the urgency and help
[14:32] us to realize how late it is. Dear Lord,
[14:35] may we live for you with all that we
[14:36] are. Just so thankful for your mercy. We
[14:37] pray that you'd bless the service. Bless
[14:39] the songs that are spoken. We ask all
[14:41] these things in your name. Amen.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Paul. You may be
[14:46] seated tonight. It's good to be in his

[22:52] I faced a mountain
[22:55] that I've never faced before.
[22:58] [Music]
[23:00] That's why I'm calling on you, Lord.
[23:07] I know it's been a while.
[23:11] The Lord, please hear my prayer.
[23:15] I need you like I've never have before.
[23:25] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[23:30] [Music]
[23:33] Sometimes a troubled sea.
[23:38] [Music]
[23:41] Sometimes it takes a desert
[23:46] [Music]
[23:48] to get a hold
[23:51] of me.
[23:53] [Music]
[23:56] Your love is so much stronger.

[24:04] Then whatever
[24:05] [Music]
[24:06] troubles me.
[24:10] [Music]
[24:12] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[24:15] [Applause]
[24:19] to trust you and
[24:22] believe.
[24:24] [Music]
[24:30] Forgive me, Jesus.
[24:33] I thought I could control
[24:38] whatever life would throw my way.
[24:44] But this, I will admit,
[24:48] has brought me to my knees.
[24:52] I need you, Lord. And I'm not ashamed
[24:56] to say.
[25:02] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[25:09] Sometimes a troubled sea.
[25:17] Sometimes it takes a desert
[25:24] to get a hold
[25:27] of me.
[25:31] Your love is so much stronger
[25:38] than whatever
[25:40] [Music]
[25:42] troubles me.
[25:46] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[25:50] [Music]
[25:54] to trust you and
[25:56] believe.
[26:01] Your love is so much stronger
[26:08] than whatever
[26:10] [Music]
[26:12] trles me.
[26:16] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[26:24] to trust you and
[26:27] believe.
[26:28] [Music]
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Billy. Sometimes it
[26:42] takes a mountain to get our attention.

[26:46] stand tonight and wanted to sing the
[26:49] potter's hands.
[26:51] How many times do we find ourselves on
[26:53] that potter's wheel molding and shaping
[26:56] us?
[26:56] &gt;&gt; But I want to be molded into the image
[26:58] that he wants for me tonight.

[31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads, our
[31:10] hearts together. Is that your desire?
[31:13] And let me be in the potter's hands.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows what's best for us, what
[31:18] we go through. Sometimes he's got to
[31:21] shape us, remold us.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; But when he gets done, we shall be like
[31:26] the stature of a perfect man.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, as we come to you

[31:44] you. We thank you for your traveling
[31:46] mercies for Sandy and I and the Chuas as
[31:49] we went into foreign lands, Lord, to be
[31:52] a witness for you. Father, I pray that
[31:55] you'll take uh and open the word of God
[31:58] to our understanding tonight. Father,
[32:01] let us see the the snares of this end
[32:04] time. Father, that we be not caught up
[32:08] uh in something of the ws of the enemy.
[32:11] Lord, I pray that you will bless each

[32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can
[32:21] be seated for just a moment. Amen. I
[32:25] appreciate the song special tonight,
[32:27] Brother Billy. That was enjoyed that.
[32:29] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[32:32] God lets different things come into your
[32:34] life and and uh so
[32:36] &gt;&gt; he uses all things to work together for
[32:39] the good.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Didn't say they would all be good, but
[32:43] said it'll
[32:44] &gt;&gt; work together for the good.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, I'm just uh happy to be
[32:50] home and Sandy made me some real strong
[32:53] coffee to drink before I came to
[32:56] service. So, I told her, I said, "I hope
[32:58] I don't fall asleep uh while I'm in the
[33:01] pulpit." And she says, "I hope I don't
[33:03] fall asleep while So, I'm watching you,
[33:05] honey. You keep keep your eyes open."
[33:09] Yeah. But God is good. Amen. We um uh
[33:13] Brother Mario is going to go ahead and
[33:16] give us a little bit of an update on uh
[33:18] on Sunday of a little bit of our trip,
[33:21] some photos and things and and
[33:23] everything. that I I thought I would
[33:25] give you something that that was we
[33:27] found quite humorous. Um is we got done
[33:30] with our meetings in the Philippines and
[33:32] we flew to Thailand and we got to
[33:34] Thailand after midnight. So, and and
[33:37] you're in a foreign country, you don't
[33:38] know is there going to be taxis there or
[33:40] there, you know, to get around to take
[33:43] us from the airport unto So, anyway,
[33:47] brother Mario has got a friend uh of his
[33:50] uh sister Josephine's old friend that
[33:53] lived next door to them, I think, in the
[33:55] Philippines, and he's been living in
[33:58] Thailand for many years now and married
[34:01] a a girl from Thailand. Anyway, long
[34:04] story short, they called him and said,
[34:06] "Hey, will you get a hold of somebody?"
[34:08] And so, uh, you know how you have people
[34:10] holding up a sign that has a name on it,
[34:13] you know? So, Mario Chua, real big like
[34:15] this. So, we got off. Oh, this is good.
[34:17] This is good. So, we got a guy waiting
[34:19] for us and he take our luggage and we
[34:21] put it in the car. And so, Mario, I have
[34:23] him sit in the front because he's bigger
[34:25] and he needs more room, you know, for
[34:27] his legs. And so, Mario, you know,
[34:29] always asks, "So, uh, what is your
[34:31] name?" He said, "What is my name?" And
[34:34] uh he said, "Yes, I'm I'm" because poor
[34:37] English, you know. Yes. Uh what is your
[34:39] name? What what is my name? And uh
[34:44] so yes. Yes. I'm asking uh what is your
[34:48] name? And he said what is my name? Ah
[34:53] yeah. Who's on first? Right. It's one of
[34:56] those things you got you're do you
[34:59] understand my English? What? His name
[35:01] actually is what and uh it it means
[35:06] temple. Temple. So anyway, that was
[35:09] funny. We we were going back and forth.
[35:11] So what? Yeah. What is my name?
[35:15] Okay,
[35:17] brother Brighton, you have your brother
[35:19] here tonight, Joseph Lubanza. Where is
[35:23] that? You, brother Joseph, come on up
[35:24] here. Is he older than you, Brighton, or
[35:27] younger? He's older. Okay, come on up
[35:30] here, brother Joseph. I'd like you to um
[35:33] to greet the people here. He is a
[35:35] minister and he's living in Ireland,
[35:39] Stephen. So, you need to talk to him.
[35:40] He's living in Ireland. Find out where
[35:42] he's at. Come on up here, brother
[35:43] Joseph. And uh this is brother
[35:46] Brighton's
[35:48] uh flesh brother. God bless you.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're older than Brighton, huh?
[35:54] How how much older?
[35:56] &gt;&gt; I'm 59.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; 59. How old is he?
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm not going to embarrass you.
[36:04] Come on up here. Greet the people.
[36:05] Please say hello. God bless you.
[36:09] God bless you. I'd like to greet you all
[36:11] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; I'm very happy to be among you tonight
[36:18] and fellowship with you around the word
[36:19] of God.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; As pastor said, my name is Joseph
[36:24] Lubanza. I live in Ireland
[36:27] but formerly I'm from Congo. That's why
[36:31] I got a lot of churches around. We
[36:35] establish churches and we put some
[36:37] pastors there. So we
[36:41] are now in Ireland because we have to
[36:44] move there for some troubles we have in
[36:47] Congo civil wars. That's why I moved the
[36:50] family there. I love you. I appreciate
[36:53] you. God bless you.
[36:56] [Applause]
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to thank our brother
[37:03] Stephen and brother James for preaching
[37:05] in ourstead while we're gone. I never
[37:07] have to worry about it. I know you're
[37:09] well fed and everything. I did hear
[37:12] Stephen's remark. He said, "Well, our
[37:13] pastor left sick and we he'll probably
[37:17] come home well
[37:19] instead of going away well and then
[37:22] coming home sick." So that's what
[37:23] happened actually. The Lord really
[37:25] really gave us grace because I was not
[37:28] feeling well, lost my voice and and
[37:31] everything. But two days before um I
[37:34] just prayed about it and the Lord put it
[37:36] on my heart to to go ahead and go. It is
[37:39] never recommended to leave when you're
[37:42] not feeling well and everything. But we
[37:44] went and when we landed over there in
[37:46] Philippines, uh uh it wound up I still
[37:50] don't have a voice and I've got three
[37:53] services to to take and everything. And
[37:56] so I'm asking them, you know, pray for
[37:58] me. So they were all praying for me
[38:00] anyway. Uh so the day of the services, I
[38:03] got a voice,
[38:05] &gt;&gt; you know, so praise God. And and I feel
[38:08] and I I tell you what, I felt so good
[38:10] throughout all of my whole trip. I I
[38:13] just felt pumped. So I'm pumped tonight.
[38:18] [Laughter]
[38:21] I got some caffeine in me. I'm feeling
[38:23] good. We'll have a short quick work here
[38:27] tonight.
[38:30] We love all of you. Thank you so much
[38:32] for coming to the house of God tonight
[38:35] and uh being so faithful to Christ.
[38:38] Thank you musicians. God bless you.
[38:40] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's stand together.
[38:44] Allelujah.
[38:49] Praise the Lord.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:54] So many people have been gone and
[38:57] cruises and different things like that
[38:58] and different ones. Sister Marty, you've
[39:00] been gone a long time. It's good to have
[39:03] you back. Each and every one of you, I
[39:04] just take a moment to look at your faces
[39:07] and make contact with you. Uh you're a
[39:10] great blessing to me. A great blessing
[39:12] to me. I feel honored honored to have
[39:16] such high quality believers as what we
[39:19] have here in this church.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; I do. I don't just say it. I I believe
[39:23] it with all my heart. Luke chapter 21.
[39:26] Luke chapter 21. Then we'll go to
[39:28] Revelation chapter 3.
[39:33] Amen. Just a little thought the Lord put
[39:35] on my heart and I just very quickly
[39:37] typed something up before I came. So
[39:40] Luke chap 21 verse 29.
[39:44] Luke 21 29. And he spake to them a
[39:48] parable.
[39:50] Behold the fig tree and all the trees.
[39:54] We know the fig tree is a type of
[39:56] Israel. And when they now shoot forth,
[40:00] you know of your own selves that summer
[40:04] is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye,
[40:07] when you see these things come to pass,
[40:10] know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh
[40:13] at hand. So what God does is he gives
[40:16] you signs to let you know the season in
[40:19] which you're in.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; And the closeness of his coming.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; So there'll be no one with any excuse
[40:27] because God, Brother Brand preached the
[40:30] sermon, the flashing red lights of the
[40:32] signs of his coming. We see it. We see
[40:34] it all around us.
[40:36] Verily, verily, I say unto you, this
[40:38] generation shall not pass away till all
[40:41] be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall
[40:43] pass away, but my word words shall not
[40:46] pass away. and take heed to yourselves,
[40:51] lest that at any time your hearts be
[40:53] overcharged with surfing and drunkenness
[40:58] and cares of this life, so that that day
[41:02] come upon you unawares.
[41:05] For as a snare shall it come on all them
[41:07] that dwell on the face of the whole
[41:10] earth. Watch ye therefore and pray
[41:13] always that you may be accounted worthy
[41:16] to escape all these things that shall
[41:18] come to pass and to stand before the son
[41:21] of man. Amen. Turn with me now if you
[41:26] would to Revelation chapter 3. Very
[41:29] familiar portion of scripture. And I
[41:31] want to just as you're turning to
[41:33] Revelation 3, we'll go to the verse 14.
[41:37] But we're talking about Ladya. And
[41:39] understand in the seven church ages
[41:41] every time there is a messenger unto the
[41:44] angel of Ephesus, unto the angel of
[41:46] Samrna and Thitra and you are all very
[41:49] much aware of that. But as that angel
[41:52] preaches his message, the spirit is
[41:55] speaking something
[41:57] &gt;&gt; that each one of the over each one of
[42:00] those in that age are going to have to
[42:02] overcome specific issues of that age.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Understand? Those are the things that we
[42:09] have to be aware of lest it be a snare
[42:12] to us.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; So, Revelations 3:14,
[42:19] "And unto the angel of the church of the
[42:21] Ladyans, write these things saith thee,
[42:24] Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
[42:27] beginning of the creation of God. I know
[42:30] thy works.
[42:31] Thou art neither cold nor hot. I would,
[42:36] thou were cold or hot. So then, because
[42:39] thou art lukewarm,
[42:42] and neither cold nor hot, I will spew
[42:45] thee out of my mouth.
[42:48] Because thou sayest,
[42:51] I am rich, and increased with goods, and
[42:54] have need of nothing, and knowest not
[42:57] that thou are wretched, and miserable,
[43:00] and poor, and blind, and naked. I
[43:05] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[43:08] the fire that thou mayest be riched in
[43:11] white raignment that thou mayest be
[43:12] clothed that the shame of thy nakedness
[43:15] do not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[43:18] thyself that thou mayest see. As many as
[43:22] I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous
[43:26] therefore
[43:27] and repent. May God bless the reading of
[43:30] his word tonight. You may be seated in
[43:33] the presence of the Lord.
[43:36] Amen. To he that hath an ear, let him
[43:38] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[43:41] church. So we see now I'd like to title
[43:44] this
[43:45] uh this evening the snares of Laiusa.
[43:49] The snares of Ladius.
[43:51] And I take a subject of the
[43:54] deceitfulness of the cares of life. Now
[43:57] this may not seem to be real spiritual
[44:00] or whatever but I just want to put you
[44:02] in remembrance of the things that we are
[44:04] going to have to overcome because um
[44:08] when God gives the analysis of this age
[44:12] because you say I am increased with
[44:14] goods I have need of nothing and on and
[44:18] on and he says but you don't even know
[44:21] that you're poor miserable blind
[44:23] wretched and naked.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you don't know it. Can you
[44:27] imagine the people's minds so corrupted
[44:31] that they they're in this horrible
[44:33] condition and don't know it.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; So that's why he says, "I want to I'm
[44:38] going to ask you to to buy of me gold."
[44:41] And that gold is the the the trials and
[44:44] the temptations that you're going to go
[44:47] through to bring you that Christlike
[44:50] character.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Larry. Sister
[44:53] Linda, too. It's good to see you guys.
[44:54] She snuck in on us while we were gone.
[44:56] It's good to have you here. So, God
[44:58] bless you richly. And so, you see, and
[45:01] then white raignment that you may be
[45:03] clothed and is. What is is
[45:07] a the Holy Spirit
[45:08] &gt;&gt; that will anoint your eyes that you
[45:10] might see the conditions of the church
[45:13] and be aware of it. It's a terrible
[45:16] thing to to be poor, miserable, blind,
[45:18] wretched, and naked, and you don't know
[45:20] it.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; So, God help us that we understand. So,
[45:24] we've got to take heed of what the
[45:26] spirit is saying about this age. And as
[45:29] we see the fig tree putting forth her
[45:32] bud, we know that this generation shall
[45:34] not pass away. So, we know we're right
[45:37] here. We're right at the end time. We're
[45:41] in the midst. Gross darkness is covering
[45:44] the people. And just about the time you
[45:46] don't think the people can get worse,
[45:48] they get worse.
[45:50] uh the things that are happening, it is
[45:53] so far beyond normal thinking that what
[45:58] you're doing, you are witnessing America
[46:01] coming apart at the seams.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; She's not going to get better. She's not
[46:05] going to recover. Um and understand that
[46:08] she starts as a lamb, but the prophecy
[46:12] is that she shall come forth and speak
[46:15] as a dragon. That's the prophecy of
[46:17] America. So it's going to get worse. The
[46:21] conditions will get worse. But we thank
[46:24] God that whenever things uh get worse,
[46:27] God gets better.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, we would become uh
[46:34] &gt;&gt; you know, we we become in despair and
[46:36] despondent and depressed and oh what's
[46:39] the use or whatever. But whenever the
[46:42] enemy comes in like a flood,
[46:44] &gt;&gt; God will raise up a standard against it.
[46:47] So thank God. You know what? You are the
[46:49] standard.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; You are the part of what God is raising
[46:52] up in this hour.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "Look, and many
[46:57] of you will never preach a sermon, but
[46:59] you'll live one."
[47:01] &gt;&gt; So, let our lives
[47:03] shine the light of this glorious gospel
[47:06] in the end time. We're not ashamed of
[47:08] it.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Snares are used to catch something. a
[47:12] snare. Like over in Africa, they put a
[47:15] snare, which is usually a wire or some
[47:17] kind of a tripping device that when the
[47:20] animal and and they put them in areas of
[47:23] high capacity. In other words, there's
[47:26] going to be a lot of volume of things
[47:27] going through this area like a game
[47:30] trail and whatever puts their foot in
[47:32] there and they kind of trip it up and
[47:34] then it catches and the the more they
[47:36] pull the more it tightens. And it's a
[47:40] it's a horrible thing to see an animal
[47:42] that has been snared. It's a horrible
[47:45] thing to see a Christian or somebody in
[47:48] this world being snared by the things of
[47:51] Laosa. And we'll look at these things.
[47:53] Well, look at these the the
[47:55] deceitfulness of riches and the things
[47:58] and the cares of life. This is not
[48:00] sinful things,
[48:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:02] &gt;&gt; It's just the cares of life. And if
[48:04] we're not careful and we're not aware of
[48:07] this, you can become a victim yourself
[48:10] because you're not aware of the snares
[48:13] of ladies.
[48:15] Jesus warns the the people that there
[48:18] will be all of these snares at the end
[48:20] time. So we have to um be aware of that.
[48:23] It said let your heart not be
[48:26] overcharged.
[48:28] That the the Greek word means to weigh
[48:31] down to burden to charge to to have a
[48:34] heavy load to be pressed upon. You talk
[48:36] about a pressure right now. You know uh
[48:38] brother Bram says watch when you see
[48:40] that third pull and it begins to
[48:43] manifest itself. He said watch that
[48:46] pressure. And how many of you realize
[48:48] we're having pressure? There's there's
[48:50] pressure just cares of life uh uh going
[48:54] to the grocery store uh everything is a
[48:57] pressure and we have but you know what I
[49:00] want you to understand you are
[49:01] pressurized
[49:04] &gt;&gt; and if and we have to have the area to
[49:08] let off pressure otherwise you will
[49:11] there's two ways to that pressure can
[49:13] affect you
[49:14] &gt;&gt; you can you can either explode or
[49:18] implode And both ways are not not nice.
[49:22] You ever seen somebody explode? They
[49:23] don't explode nicely. There's pieces
[49:26] everywhere. Their family falls apart.
[49:29] Everything, your job, your career,
[49:31] everything just just or you have so much
[49:35] pressure, you implode. You know, you sit
[49:37] there and become reclusive. Next thing
[49:39] you know, uh the pressure is so great
[49:42] and I'm going, why should I go to
[49:44] church? and next thing you know, you're
[49:46] you're having these things affect you.
[49:49] And Satan wants to keep you away from
[49:52] fellowship.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; It's extremely important for you to come
[49:57] to church
[49:58] &gt;&gt; more important than you possibly realize
[50:02] &gt;&gt; and even that much more so as we see
[50:05] that day approaching. No,
[50:07] &gt;&gt; those material things that can be a
[50:09] snare to God, like I said, there they
[50:12] within themselves are not evil, but they
[50:16] are things that if we're not careful and
[50:19] we don't keep them under control, it can
[50:21] be a snare to you. In Matthew chapter 6
[50:25] 31 and 33, therefore take no thought,
[50:28] saying, "What shall we eat and what
[50:31] shall we drink and wherewith shall we be
[50:33] clothed?" You know the first thing you
[50:35] do when you get up in the morning is
[50:38] what am I going to eat? What am I going
[50:40] to wear? So these are issues that we
[50:42] deal with on a daily basis.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; For after all these things do the
[50:48] Gentiles seek. For your heavenly father
[50:52] knoweth that you have need of all these
[50:54] things. How many How many realize he
[50:56] knows?
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Oh God, are you sure uh that you know
[51:02] all? Come on.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; He knows you have need of all these
[51:06] things.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; But seek ye first the kingdom of God.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; And his righteousness and all these
[51:14] things shall be added unto you.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; That's why my brother, my sister,
[51:20] listen. You're not to be looking for
[51:22] those things that's going to produce a
[51:24] greater life in this kingdom because our
[51:28] world, our kingdom is not of this world.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have another kingdom that is
[51:34] far greater than this one here. That's
[51:36] why you are a pilgrim and a stranger in
[51:39] this world.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; So, we've got to prioritize our lives.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; We've got to be aware of the things that
[51:47] can snare us down, stumble us up, and
[51:51] you might become a victim of the snares
[51:54] of a lot of them. Brother Brennan picks
[51:57] this up in the Sranian church age. And I
[51:59] just uh let's read this together. Here
[52:02] is where you have to believe again in
[52:05] love and goodness and the wisdom of God.
[52:07] This too is needful. Remember he
[52:10] admonished. Take no thought for the
[52:12] tomorrow. What you shall eat and what
[52:14] shall put on. Your father knoweth the
[52:17] things you have need of. He who clothe
[52:20] the lily and feeds the sparrow shall do
[52:23] much more for you. These physical things
[52:26] are not the true basic necessities of
[52:29] your life.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Say amen to that.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; I know you're reading it. It's good.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; These are not the basic necessities of
[52:38] your life. For a man's life consisteth
[52:41] not of the things he possesses.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; But rather, seek first the kingdom of
[52:46] God and his righteousness, and all
[52:49] material necessities will be added unto
[52:52] you.
[52:53] Seek him first. And guess what? Houses
[52:57] and clothing and food. If he'll feed the
[53:00] sparrow, how much more will God feed and
[53:03] clothe you?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; The people of God are not
[53:08] material-minded.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; They are Christminded.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; They do not seek the treasures that are
[53:14] below. They seek those above. It is
[53:17] absolutely true. The majority of
[53:19] Christians are not wealthy. Somebody say
[53:22] amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Kind he's talking to us, isn't he?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Rather, they are on the poor side. It
[53:31] was so in Jesus day. It was true in
[53:34] Paul's day and it should be true today.
[53:38] Oh, it is not too true for today. for
[53:42] the loudian age is one of the vast
[53:44] wealth where often the criterion of
[53:47] spirituality is an abundance of earthly
[53:50] goods. My how rich the church is in
[53:53] goods but how poor in spirit. Blessed be
[53:57] ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God.
[54:01] The kingdom of God is not meat and
[54:03] drink. It is not material. It is within
[54:08] us. Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; A rich man is rich in God, not in
[54:13] worldly things.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Prayer and reading your Bibles is
[54:17] absolutely essential.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; You want to keep your life prioritized,
[54:20] you got to do those simple things.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Read and pray
[54:26] &gt;&gt; every day.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to replace going to
[54:30] church with um streaming remote.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Well, today is remote. Many of you had
[54:37] jobs prior to COVID and you had to go
[54:41] into work 8 to5. You had an office. You
[54:43] had things to do. Now many of you work
[54:46] remotely. And so that that spirit of
[54:50] working remotely is also creeping right
[54:53] into the church. Well, you know, look,
[54:56] uh it's so easy to go ahead and stay
[54:59] home. I don't have to put on nice
[55:01] clothes and go to church and I don't
[55:03] feel well and I'm kind of tired. And you
[55:05] get all these excuses.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, Satan will do everything
[55:10] he can to get you so overburdened
[55:12] because work. And the thing you don't
[55:15] realize I'm on a treadmill. Well, you
[55:18] might have put yourself there. You might
[55:21] have said, "Well, I need that job. I
[55:23] need this. I need a bigger car.
[55:26] Everybody wants a nice car. New Yeah.
[55:29] When I go to the car wash and I want my
[55:31] car wash, I tell them, "What what smell
[55:32] do you want? New car.
[55:35] Give me new car. Like that new car. But
[55:38] listen, that car that you buy and you
[55:40] drive it off of the lot, you take it
[55:42] back the next day, you want to trade it
[55:44] in. Oh man, this thing's a junker. It's
[55:46] it's $15,000. You just lost $15,000
[55:49] right off the top. Hey, listen. You
[55:51] know, and all of a sudden, this this uh
[55:54] joy of having a new car now for the next
[55:56] five, six years, you got a $500 payment.
[55:59] The joy just very quickly
[56:02] &gt;&gt; leaves. And then you think that old
[56:03] junker wasn't so bad.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. Anyway,
[56:09] I believe that what the devil is doing
[56:11] today is he's using
[56:14] social media, the computer, and cell
[56:17] phones.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; My wife read an article yesterday about
[56:21] over in China, they're making it a law
[56:23] that you cannot let your children in
[56:26] China, okay, have a cell phone until
[56:29] they're 18 and older.
[56:33] Praise God.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is amazing
[56:40] to see and and and we saw this over in
[56:42] the Philippines. We saw it there uh in
[56:45] Thailand that everywhere everywhere we
[56:49] went, children all had their own little
[56:52] cell phone and they're sitting there.
[56:55] They're not talking to mom and dad. or
[56:57] not. Uh, you know, they're this here and
[57:00] they're doing this and I mean, and this
[57:03] little cell phone or the iPad is right
[57:05] there. Imagine what it does to the the
[57:08] eyes
[57:10] &gt;&gt; and the different things. Okay, they're
[57:11] sitting here and they're just uh uh
[57:14] working on this little thing. Well, it's
[57:17] also putting thoughts into their minds.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; It is the highest form of brainwashing
[57:24] in the world today. You wouldn't let
[57:26] your child play with a loaded gun, but
[57:30] you'll put something like that. I say to
[57:32] all of the parents here, all of you be
[57:36] extremely
[57:37] aware,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; with your children,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; okay, of what they're doing. either.
[57:45] I'll tell you if you if they have an
[57:48] Instagram or if they have a Facebook or
[57:51] if they have one of these social medias,
[57:54] ask to go on their site and see how many
[57:57] of the their friends are friends from
[58:00] the world.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Okay, it might shock you.
[58:09] And another thing too, uh, it it's a
[58:13] real cute thing for our children today,
[58:16] especially our girls. I haven't seen the
[58:19] boys do it, but I'm sure there are some
[58:21] that do it. Is they all get together and
[58:23] they do this.
[58:27] Got to be kidding me.
[58:29] Who are you puckering up for?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Honestly, now look. Yeah,
[58:35] I'm an old man, 72 and everything like
[58:38] that. But listen,
[58:40] sisters, be aware of that.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Be careful. I don't want you out there.
[58:45] I want you to look nice, but not too
[58:47] nice,
[58:48] &gt;&gt; okay? You don't have to do what the
[58:50] world does. You don't have to, hey,
[58:53] and give all these signs and stuff like
[58:55] that. Who cares?
[58:58] &gt;&gt; I didn't get one.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:02] It's just something to be aware of.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. All kinds of filters that we uh
[59:10] can put on cell phones or computers and
[59:12] everything, but the I'll tell you the
[59:13] only filter that is 100% is the Holy
[59:16] Spirit
[59:18] &gt;&gt; who will convict you
[59:19] &gt;&gt; when you get on there and you do
[59:21] something wrong, convict you. And you
[59:23] know what? It'll filter itself.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; That's a real thinking man's filter.
[59:28] Amen. The Bible says that uh don't let
[59:32] your uh heart be overcharged. Don't let
[59:35] the weight of the world and things come
[59:37] upon you or a surfet. Uh I looked up the
[59:41] Greek word surf s u r fi t. It means uh
[59:46] a headache
[59:48] having from too much intoxication
[59:52] or pain caused by overindulgence
[59:57] either by eating or drinking. Any of you
[59:59] ever ate too much?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah, man. Oh,
[1:00:04] got to undo the belt here because you
[1:00:07] know I had a little bit. You see that's
[1:00:09] what the world if you're not careful.
[1:00:12] Okay, you overindulge surfing
[1:00:17] and it means in Webster's dictionary it
[1:00:21] means excess indulgence as in food or in
[1:00:24] drink. There is another word uh that is
[1:00:30] also associated with that is to
[1:00:32] dissipate or dissolute. Dissipate means
[1:00:36] to eat or drink to an excess.
[1:00:40] overindulgence.
[1:00:43] And so God help us. It's not that eating
[1:00:47] and drinking is sinful
[1:00:50] in itself. No. No. The Bible does say
[1:00:53] beware, you know, the glutton and
[1:00:55] overeating. One thing I think was very,
[1:00:57] very interesting. I'll tell you a story
[1:00:59] that Brother Jim Dalton told me. Brother
[1:01:01] Jim, the pastor up in Flagstaff, uh,
[1:01:04] former pastor up there, now Brother
[1:01:06] Steve Robson is their pastor. But
[1:01:08] brother Jim, they took Brother Brandham
[1:01:10] hunting with them up uh in Colorado or
[1:01:13] perhaps it was in Prescat somewhere, I
[1:01:16] forget, but they were out hunting and
[1:01:18] they were around the campfire and
[1:01:20] they're talking and brother Brennham is
[1:01:22] sharing and everything. And he said, "Uh
[1:01:25] uh, brethren, everywhere I go, the Holy
[1:01:27] Spirit is not far from me, that pillar
[1:01:29] of fire." And he says, "In fact, turn."
[1:01:32] He said, "There it is in the top of that
[1:01:33] tree." They all turned. They were all
[1:01:36] turned around and saw that amber light
[1:01:38] in the top of the tree. And so, Brother
[1:01:41] Jim said he was there until the early
[1:01:45] morning and until sunrise. But, Brother
[1:01:49] Jim, as he was passing Brother
[1:01:50] Brennham's uh tent. Now, Brother Bram
[1:01:53] said, "Brother, listen. We got to get up
[1:01:55] early, so I'm going my tent." They had
[1:01:57] fixed his own private tent. And so as
[1:02:00] Jim was uh Brother Jim was walking by
[1:02:04] the tent, he hears Brother Brennan
[1:02:06] praying out loud. And he says, "Brother
[1:02:09] Ron, I didn't want to be a hypocrite or
[1:02:11] anything, but I wanted to hear how he
[1:02:14] prayed in private."
[1:02:17] And he said something as best as I can
[1:02:19] remember. Brother Jim tells the story.
[1:02:22] He said, "Um, Heavenly Father, we had
[1:02:24] such a lovely time with the brethren
[1:02:26] tonight. I pray that I didn't um I you
[1:02:30] know I didn't
[1:02:32] tell too many funny stories or anything
[1:02:34] like that. He said, "We had such a a a
[1:02:37] lovely time." And he says, "And father,
[1:02:41] uh would you forgive me? I had a little
[1:02:43] bit too much for dinner."
[1:02:46] Now, I don't know about you, but when I
[1:02:49] heard that, I thought, "When have any of
[1:02:52] you
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; I don't even tell my wife. I've had too
[1:02:56] much for dinner.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; To be so intimate with God.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; In your prayer. Father, I'm sorry. I
[1:03:07] I overeat for dinner tonight. Imagine
[1:03:10] having that that uh simplicity and the
[1:03:14] sensitivity
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; to be so close to him that you would
[1:03:18] excuse yourself and say, "Forgive me. I
[1:03:20] had too much
[1:03:23] for dinner.
[1:03:26] I think that in this age we see there is
[1:03:28] a lot of eating and drinking disorders
[1:03:33] and it just goes along with the the this
[1:03:36] end time. Um if your heart is not right
[1:03:40] with God, listen to me now. If your
[1:03:43] heart is not right with God, these
[1:03:46] things can become a snare to you. The
[1:03:49] cares of life can snare you and take the
[1:03:52] very life out of you.
[1:03:55] We can see this in the parable of the
[1:03:57] swer of seed. Matthew chapter 13. Let's
[1:04:01] read this in the scripture. Matthew 13
[1:04:03] verse 22. He also that receive seed
[1:04:06] among the thorns. So remember it's the
[1:04:09] type ground. And I ask you, what is your
[1:04:11] ground like tonight?
[1:04:14] Because the type ground you have will
[1:04:18] affect the seed that has been sown
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; into your heart. Nothing wrong with the
[1:04:25] seed. It's the ground in which it was
[1:04:28] received in. And so also that received
[1:04:31] seed among the thorns is he that heareth
[1:04:35] the word and the care of this world and
[1:04:39] the deceitfulness of riches choke the
[1:04:42] word
[1:04:43] and he becometh unfruitful. Have you
[1:04:46] ever met anyone that ran for a while,
[1:04:50] but the next thing you know they got a
[1:04:52] new job or a new home or and money and
[1:04:56] they're chasing the almighty dollar and
[1:04:57] all next thing you know they're not in
[1:04:59] church.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Where are they? The cares of life.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; It wasn't sin. It was cares of life and
[1:05:08] it choked the word. It becomes
[1:05:09] unfruitful. But he that receiveth seed
[1:05:12] into the good ground, is he that heareth
[1:05:15] the word, and understandeth it,
[1:05:19] which also beareth fruit, and bringeth
[1:05:21] forth such a hundfold, some 60, and some
[1:05:25] 30. I don't want to be just a 30fold,
[1:05:28] nor a s. I want to be hundfold.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; I want fruit all over my life. I don't
[1:05:34] want just some spinly little uh orange
[1:05:37] on my orange tree if if that's what I
[1:05:39] am. I want to bear fruit. I want my uh
[1:05:43] my limbs to be bearing much fruit.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will take your life and purge
[1:05:50] it that it might bring forth more fruit.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; You know what purging means? Cutting off
[1:05:56] things that just not necessary.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; That's what they do. A harborist, one or
[1:06:01] arborist, not a harborist. An arborist
[1:06:05] is one who takes care of trees. And you
[1:06:07] know what they do? They purge it.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; They cut off the unnecessary limbs
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; to therefore the to make it more
[1:06:15] fruitful.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; See, so in Mark chapter 9 verses 19
[1:06:20] through 20 and the cares of this world
[1:06:23] and the deceitfulness of riches and the
[1:06:27] lust of other things entering in. Look
[1:06:30] at this. The lust of other things
[1:06:33] choke the word and it becomes
[1:06:35] unfruitful. And these are they which are
[1:06:37] sown on good ground, such as hear the
[1:06:40] word, receive it, bring forth fruit,
[1:06:42] some 30, some 60, some hundfold.
[1:06:45] Again, we see the deceitfulness of
[1:06:47] riches, but notice what else is listed.
[1:06:51] Other things.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Wow. We could we could start uh having a
[1:06:57] fill in up here right now. Tell me what
[1:06:59] are the other things that can be a snare
[1:07:01] to you. What are the other things? It
[1:07:04] might be your hobby. It might be
[1:07:06] different things that you have that
[1:07:08] takes away your time from serving God,
[1:07:12] from going to church, from doing the
[1:07:14] things that you need to do. And it may
[1:07:16] not be sinful. It's just the cares of
[1:07:19] life and and these other things. God
[1:07:22] help us to be aware of that.
[1:07:27] In Luke 8:es 14 and 15. And that which
[1:07:31] fell among thorns are they which when
[1:07:34] they have heard go forth and are choked
[1:07:36] with the cares and riches and pleasures
[1:07:39] of this life. We all like pleasures. We
[1:07:43] all like the
[1:07:45] easy road. We like the nice things. If
[1:07:48] we're not careful, the pleasures of this
[1:07:51] life,
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; can become a snare to you
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; and bring forth no fruit to perfection.
[1:07:59] But that on the good ground are they
[1:08:01] which in an honest and good heart,
[1:08:06] having heard the word, keep it, and
[1:08:08] bring forth fruit with patience.
[1:08:11] Pleasures of this life will deceive you
[1:08:13] if your heart's not right with God.
[1:08:16] the pleasures of this life. You know the
[1:08:18] Bible says that the heart
[1:08:22] it is a deceitful thing. In Genesis 6
[1:08:24] and5 God saw that the wickedness of man
[1:08:27] was great in the earth and that every
[1:08:30] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[1:08:32] was only evil continually.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 28 26. He that trusteth in his
[1:08:40] own heart is a fool.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Y
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; never trust in your own heart. Ah, just,
[1:08:47] you know, God, give me the desire of my
[1:08:50] heart. God, I don't want the desire of
[1:08:53] my heart. I want the desire of your
[1:08:55] heart to be my will.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; I want your will to be my will. Not not
[1:09:00] not don't turn me over to my own heart.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; My heart is deceitfully wicked.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah
[1:09:09] 17:es 9 and 10, the heart is deceitful
[1:09:12] above all things.
[1:09:14] and desperately wicked. Who can know it?
[1:09:17] I the Lord searchth the heart. I try the
[1:09:19] reigns even to give every man according
[1:09:22] to his ways
[1:09:24] and according to the fruit of his
[1:09:26] doings.
[1:09:28] You will get what you sow.
[1:09:31] It is the law of God. Be not deceived.
[1:09:34] God is not mocked.
[1:09:37] So, I've seen so many good people how
[1:09:40] they've gotten snared by the
[1:09:42] deceitfulness of riches and the
[1:09:45] pleasures of this life and they choked
[1:09:47] over and it becomes unfruitful
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; and next thing you know the love of many
[1:09:52] waxes cold
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; and no longer on fire, no longer uh
[1:09:58] seeking God. Why? Because you just you
[1:10:00] you know look loud
[1:10:03] uh the lukewarmness
[1:10:07] God said, "I'd rather be hot or cold."
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Get in or get out,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; but because thou art lukewarm,
[1:10:16] I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; You know, when you go to the hospital
[1:10:21] and you have ingested something, a
[1:10:23] poison or whatever, they give you
[1:10:25] something to cause you to vomit, an epic
[1:10:28] or whatever they call it. I don't I hope
[1:10:30] I say it right, but they give you
[1:10:32] something and it's usually warm. Could
[1:10:34] be some kind of warm milk or something
[1:10:37] like that and they give it to you, get
[1:10:39] you to throw up. Well, imagine that the
[1:10:43] lukewarmness of this age, okay, causes
[1:10:48] God to want to spew you,
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; you understand?
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Spew you out of his mouth. And a lot of
[1:10:55] times,
[1:10:57] what man calls the middle of the road,
[1:11:01] God calls lukewarm.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] God help us.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Let me burn for you, Lord.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me be fanatical. Let me let me
[1:11:14] when I come to church, let me put my all
[1:11:16] into it. Let me put my shoulder to the
[1:11:18] wheel. Let me pray about the service
[1:11:20] before we come. And Lord, would you use
[1:11:23] the minister to speak to me? I don't
[1:11:25] want some flowery sermon we're all going
[1:11:27] to heaven because we're not.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Broad is the way.
[1:11:34] And wide is the gate that leads to
[1:11:36] destruction and many go in there at
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; but small and narrow is the way.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; God, I don't want to go the broad way.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; I want to go the small way.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; I want to go that narrow way. And it the
[1:11:52] Bible says in few be that go therein at
[1:11:57] God help us.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:01] How many people do you know that have
[1:12:03] endured for a season?
[1:12:05] They were there and they sprung up
[1:12:07] quickly, but then the cares of life and
[1:12:09] different things and next thing you
[1:12:11] know, they're burned out. Where are
[1:12:12] they? If we were to take a loan,
[1:12:16] John and Linda Laauo do the church
[1:12:18] directory. If we were to have everybody
[1:12:21] that's been in this church from the time
[1:12:23] that we started it, we couldn't hold
[1:12:26] them all here in this church.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:31] Do you know that
[1:12:33] it would be amazing to me to see as many
[1:12:36] people here on a Wednesday night as what
[1:12:38] we have on Sunday morning?
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just talking now and I realize
[1:12:44] there are a lot of people they have to
[1:12:46] work throughout the week. I realize that
[1:12:48] I I am not saying that uh put uh you
[1:12:53] know pressure on people because they
[1:12:54] can't be here on a Wednesday night. But
[1:12:56] I will say this,
[1:12:58] God help us that we don't
[1:13:01] become slackful.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Because yeah, Wednesday night, uh, you
[1:13:07] know, you if you only knew how busy I
[1:13:09] am. Listen, one of the busiest guys I
[1:13:12] know in this church is my son Amos.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; That guy, I I don't even like to ride in
[1:13:17] his car with him on the cell phone. He
[1:13:19] get
[1:13:20] Hey, can I call you back? Yeah. Okay.
[1:13:22] Over here. And
[1:13:24] stuff. And he said, "Dad, I tell you, I
[1:13:27] am so busy." He says, "I've got every
[1:13:30] excuse why to stay home." Is that right,
[1:13:32] Amos?
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; It's true, son. And I honor you
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; because you honor God.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; It's an investment.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Say that out loud.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; It's an investment.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; It's an investment.
[1:13:46] Do you really believe that you are
[1:13:48] investing?
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; That when you go to church and you
[1:13:53] invest by hearing the word because faith
[1:13:56] cometh by hearing hearing the word of
[1:13:58] God, you're actually kaching. It's being
[1:14:01] invested into your family and into your
[1:14:05] life and into things because you know
[1:14:07] what? One of these days you're going to
[1:14:08] get out of here. But if you haven't been
[1:14:10] invested,
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; huh? And you haven't been be
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; been depositing into your account, guess
[1:14:17] what? You're going to be overdrawn.
[1:14:19] There's nothing there to draw from.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; You're going to be left behind. Why?
[1:14:23] Because you're a poor investor.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; I say if you're going to invest in
[1:14:27] something, invest in the kingdom of God.
[1:14:30] Seek him first.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; In a hidden life with Christ, brother
[1:14:40] Brandon, we said we find out now that
[1:14:42] this arc being a type of the human
[1:14:44] heart, the heart is deceitful.
[1:14:48] That's where people fall today because
[1:14:50] they get a head religion
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; and instead of a heart religion.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; God, don't let me just uh have a
[1:15:02] religion,
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; let me have a relationship.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; We were we were over there in Thailand
[1:15:06] and boy, Thailand is a they have
[1:15:09] temples. It seemed like on every other
[1:15:12] corner big golden temples and you know
[1:15:15] all of this stuff and they got those
[1:15:17] guys in the orange robes and walking
[1:15:19] around their heads are shaved and and uh
[1:15:22] you know uh there's temples and and so
[1:15:25] there people are religious everywhere.
[1:15:27] They're just religious. I asked uh one
[1:15:30] of the people there I said your your
[1:15:31] wife she's she's a Buddhist. Um you know
[1:15:34] do they dance? Do they drink? Yeah.
[1:15:37] Yeah.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:15:40] They just kind of fit in with everybody.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; And you see, uh, that's just a religion.
[1:15:46] It's a covering. Brother Brennham said,
[1:15:47] "Religion is a covering."
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; That's the first thing Adam and Eve did
[1:15:52] when they found they were naked. They
[1:15:53] made a covering.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; See, so religion can be just a covering.
[1:15:59] And that's why they just put up with uh
[1:16:01] we we we went to like a mall and outside
[1:16:05] uh we were going to take a little river
[1:16:06] cruise and go up and down and you're
[1:16:08] going to see the the lights of the city
[1:16:10] of Bangkok and and uh so anyway we go
[1:16:14] outside and here's uh man oh man they
[1:16:17] got all these different religions and
[1:16:19] they got the guys and they're doing
[1:16:20] their little dances and Har
[1:16:23] Krishna Har say it har
[1:16:28] and everybody's And you don't realize
[1:16:30] you're worshiping Hari Krishna
[1:16:33] and all of the it's just and and then my
[1:16:37] you talk about people not knowing
[1:16:39] identity because transgenderism
[1:16:42] is a plague over there. You just see it.
[1:16:45] It's well you know today I think my wife
[1:16:48] saw a lady walking around. She had a
[1:16:50] tail.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of tail it was
[1:16:54] but she she had a tail. you want to be a
[1:16:57] cat or a cow or something, you know.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:17:02] you may think that it's funny. It's not,
[1:17:04] saints of God.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; And I'm not making fun of them because
[1:17:07] I'll tell you what,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; where would you be?
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Listen, where would you be? I'm not
[1:17:16] looking down at those people. I just
[1:17:17] say, "Thank God that thou has given me
[1:17:20] the eyes have, Lord, and the ability to
[1:17:23] see this." And I'm not looking down at
[1:17:25] them. I say, "Hey, but for the grace of
[1:17:27] God, there go I."
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; I would have been a radical. I'd have
[1:17:31] been some weird freak. But God in his
[1:17:34] infinite mercy.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God for
[1:17:38] predestination.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Let your desire of your heart be God's
[1:17:50] desire.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Let his will be your will.
[1:17:57] I am a rich and increased
[1:18:00] in goods and I have need of nothing.
[1:18:02] They don't even recognize what they're
[1:18:04] missing. What they're lacking the most
[1:18:07] is character.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Rem said in this life when it's
[1:18:11] all over the thing you take with you
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; is your character.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Your car, your bank account,
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; your
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; all that stuff's Yeah. It's gone. burn
[1:18:24] up.
[1:18:26] So all of this that you're trying to
[1:18:28] achieve here, guess what? You ain't
[1:18:30] taking it with you.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You lack character.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing to give you
[1:18:39] character, and that's the cause of
[1:18:41] Christ in your life.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; To give you full character
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; that you might live for him. That's the
[1:18:49] only remedy for that situation.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] Brother Bram said in loud DC in church
[1:18:55] age, you had better come before it's too
[1:18:58] late, sayaeth the Lord, and buy of me
[1:19:01] gold tried in a fire. Then you will be
[1:19:04] truly rich.
[1:19:07] Are we getting it? Listen to me. Naked
[1:19:10] physically.
[1:19:11] We came into the world, but naked
[1:19:13] spiritually we will not leave it.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. We're going to take something
[1:19:18] with us.
[1:19:20] What that something is is all we can
[1:19:23] take with us. Nothing less, nothing
[1:19:25] more. We had better
[1:19:28] be real careful now to see that we take
[1:19:32] something that might make us right
[1:19:34] before God. So then what will we take
[1:19:38] with us? We will take our character,
[1:19:40] brother. That is what we'll take with
[1:19:42] us.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Now, what kind of character will you
[1:19:45] take with you?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; What a question. Yeah.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Will it be like his whose character was
[1:19:51] molded by suffering in the fiery furnace
[1:19:54] of affliction? Or will it be the
[1:19:56] softness of the characterless
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; loud you see in people? It's up to each
[1:20:01] one of us.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; For in that day every man will bear his
[1:20:05] own burden.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; If a man has $100 character and you give
[1:20:10] him $1,000, you've ruined him.
[1:20:14] It's not the riches that destroys a man
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; because many of the men in the Bible
[1:20:20] were men of wealth.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham, Job,
[1:20:25] Solomon, but they had character first
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; because otherwise the next thing the
[1:20:33] cares of this life will choke you.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And you become unfruitful.
[1:20:40] And so I want to show you before we
[1:20:42] close here tonight. I told you coffee is
[1:20:45] starting to wear off.
[1:20:48] Hurry up and finish this sermon. My bed
[1:20:50] is calling me. Luke chapter 10. I want
[1:20:54] to show you because we're going to look
[1:20:55] at two churches here for a moment. Two
[1:20:57] churches because a woman in the
[1:20:58] scripture is a church.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Are we are we together on? Okay. Luke
[1:21:02] 10:38. Now it came to pass as they went
[1:21:06] and they entered into a certain village
[1:21:07] and a certain woman named Martha
[1:21:10] received him into her house and she had
[1:21:12] a sister called Mary which also sat at
[1:21:15] Jesus' feet and heard his word. And
[1:21:18] Martha was cumbered about much serving
[1:21:22] and came to him and said, "Lord, does
[1:21:25] not thou care that my sister hath left
[1:21:28] me to serve to left me to serve alone?
[1:21:32] Bid her therefore that she help me. And
[1:21:36] Jesus answered and said unto her. Now
[1:21:39] he's going to speak to Martha. Martha,
[1:21:42] Martha,
[1:21:44] thou art careful and troubled about many
[1:21:48] things.
[1:21:49] Look, he he's discerning her heart.
[1:21:52] Why don't you get my sister who's
[1:21:55] wanting to just sit at your feet and
[1:21:57] hear your word, but listen,
[1:22:01] have her get in here and help me. I got
[1:22:03] to do the cooking and cleaning myself,
[1:22:05] and I'm trying to prepare and do things
[1:22:08] just for you guys.
[1:22:11] But one thing is needful. Now, Jesus,
[1:22:13] watch. He's correcting the air. One
[1:22:15] thing is needful.
[1:22:17] Mary hath chosen the good part.
[1:22:23] which shall not be taken away from her.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Now he's given her a balance.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; I want you all to understand
[1:22:33] I as a pastor I think the greatest
[1:22:36] burden I have on my heart is to have b
[1:22:39] well balanced families.
[1:22:45] Don't be the the Martha who is so
[1:22:48] cumbered about her house and how it's
[1:22:51] clean and you know all the plates have
[1:22:54] got to be there and the silverware and
[1:22:55] everything is set. That's good. That's
[1:22:57] good. But what about Mary? Jesus said
[1:23:01] she chose the better part.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; I want all of you to understand you two
[1:23:06] are choosing a better part. I want you
[1:23:08] to
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to be so cumbered, so
[1:23:11] burdened
[1:23:13] just about the house and cleaning and
[1:23:15] making sure everything is in order. Why
[1:23:18] not leave some of that alone because
[1:23:20] it'll be there for you tomorrow?
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; It will. Your house don't clean itself.
[1:23:27] I understand it.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; But
[1:23:31] wouldn't it be better to choose the
[1:23:32] better part?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus was saying. Martha,
[1:23:36] Martha,
[1:23:37] Bless your heart, sweetie. He says,
[1:23:41] "It's not so bad
[1:23:43] that you sit and you learn of me
[1:23:48] because Mary has chose that part."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; God, help us make a choosing in our
[1:23:54] life.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; this is actually story of two churches.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; One is so worried about that
[1:24:01] everything's got to be in order and
[1:24:03] everything and this and that.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Wow. Sometimes I think we make the
[1:24:07] church too comfortable.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; We have air conditioning and we have
[1:24:10] heating. We have nice chairs. I've been
[1:24:13] to places there in Africa and some of
[1:24:15] you brothers Brighton and I'm sure any
[1:24:17] of you brothers from Congo, you go to
[1:24:19] places and I've seen them sitting on a
[1:24:22] 2x4 2x4 on two logs and the people
[1:24:26] sitting there for hours and they come
[1:24:28] hours before the church service starts
[1:24:31] and they sit on a little 2x4.
[1:24:35] If we did that and we took all of these
[1:24:38] chairs out and we gave 2x4s here and you
[1:24:40] had to sit on that, I guarantee it uh
[1:24:44] there'd be a whole lot less in
[1:24:46] attendance.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; I remember a little a little black boy
[1:24:53] was sitting right on the he was right up
[1:24:54] here close right to me. He was so tired.
[1:24:57] He's sitting there going
[1:25:03] like some of you do.
[1:25:08] And I thought he's going to pitch over
[1:25:09] any second and he's gonna he's just
[1:25:12] gonna go on a little 2x4,
[1:25:16] but he didn't.
[1:25:18] And I think that sometimes
[1:25:21] we have it too good.
[1:25:27] Sometimes less is better.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] Sometimes you can have the nice house
[1:25:35] and the nice car
[1:25:38] and the nice job and everything, but you
[1:25:40] have to work so hard to keep at it.
[1:25:44] And I had someone tell me not long ago,
[1:25:48] I'm just tired of the whole rat race.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of
[1:25:54] of the big city. I'm tired. I just would
[1:25:57] like to to have a house not so big, not
[1:26:02] so nice,
[1:26:05] just the cares of life. Not so who
[1:26:09] wouldn't,
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. I I want all of you to to look
[1:26:13] at your lives first.
[1:26:16] Don't get something that you can't
[1:26:19] afford.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Get something that's within your means.
[1:26:26] Otherwise,
[1:26:27] you're going to be a slave to whatever
[1:26:30] you're whether it be the car or the
[1:26:32] house.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Okay? And then you're going to burn
[1:26:35] yourself out. And then you're going to
[1:26:36] want to say, "Let's
[1:26:38] just sell this and let's just go off
[1:26:41] into the bush somewhere and, you know,
[1:26:43] build a little cabin and we'll be
[1:26:45] happy." Well, seek first.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:26:51] Seek first the kingdom of God and all
[1:26:54] these other things
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; will be added to you.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Is this good? Is this the word?
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. Doesn't seem so
[1:27:03] spiritual. But I'll tell you what, I'd
[1:27:05] rather see you seeking first the kingdom
[1:27:08] of God and his righteousness than all
[1:27:11] these other things and you become burned
[1:27:12] out.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Your family's burned out, your kids are
[1:27:15] burned out, then you get burned out. And
[1:27:17] what good is it if you if you faint?
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; It's not good.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says don't faint in welloing.
[1:27:34] If you're not careful, just the cares of
[1:27:36] life. These two churches
[1:27:41] cumbered it means to to be unnecessarily
[1:27:46] burdened
[1:27:48] to distract with the cares and duties of
[1:27:50] life.
[1:27:52] You know I became a uh firstline
[1:27:55] supervisor at Ralson Pyina.
[1:27:58] I was the first employee. Any of you
[1:27:59] ever gone to Flagstaff and you see the
[1:28:01] big parina tower there and and you've
[1:28:03] gone through there. I was the first
[1:28:05] employee hired. first one.
[1:28:09] And uh anyway, I was there and I got
[1:28:12] hired in the warehouse.
[1:28:15] Next thing you know, uh they offered me
[1:28:17] a job to become second shift manager and
[1:28:22] uh I did. I took it and everything and I
[1:28:25] was the highest paid babysitter in all
[1:28:27] of Flagstaff.
[1:28:31] and the warehouse of, you know, the
[1:28:33] warehouse is usually the the the dregs
[1:28:35] of the company. They're they're usually,
[1:28:38] you know, the not the most intellectual
[1:28:41] and, you know, they just drive a
[1:28:44] forklift and they're big and they carry
[1:28:46] heavy things and and uh stuff.
[1:28:50] Anyway, I wasn't part of them and uh
[1:28:55] I told my guys, I said, "Guys, I'm not
[1:28:57] going to babysit you." I said, 'I'll
[1:28:59] tell you, if you will listen to what I'm
[1:29:02] telling you, I says, if you'll work hard
[1:29:07] hard the first two hours, you can coast
[1:29:10] the next six.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; On any job.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; If you'll manage your time and you will
[1:29:16] really bust it for the first two hours
[1:29:19] of the job, you'll find the next six you
[1:29:22] can kind of coast. Okay. And I wound up
[1:29:27] in the whole I'm not bragging here.
[1:29:31] It's just fact
[1:29:35] that I took one of the worst efficient
[1:29:41] manh hours per forklift operator on how
[1:29:46] much that they load in the box cars and
[1:29:48] this and get shipped out. We had some of
[1:29:52] the worst these guys. you know, you just
[1:29:54] couldn't motivate these guys. I took the
[1:29:56] worst of the whole grocery products
[1:29:58] division and we became the most
[1:30:01] efficient
[1:30:04] and everybody in the front office loved
[1:30:06] it. Say, Ron, how do you do it? How did
[1:30:09] you take all of these guys? Because they
[1:30:13] all had
[1:30:14] bad records. Okay, they did. They all
[1:30:18] had bad records and uh everything. And I
[1:30:21] said, "Because you know what I've done?
[1:30:24] I've told them I'm not going to babysit
[1:30:25] you. I'm going to treat you right." I
[1:30:28] said, "The company policy, none of you
[1:30:30] are allowed to use the company phone.
[1:30:32] You're not allowed to. You can't call
[1:30:34] home. Your wife is sick." It was before
[1:30:36] cell phones. Any of you remember before
[1:30:39] cell phone? It was called the landline.
[1:30:41] Do you remember the rotary? Put that in
[1:30:43] front of a kid now. What?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; They Yeah. Ronnie, you remember that?
[1:30:48] The old rotary. Yeah. you remember? So
[1:30:51] anyway, um I went ahead and they had a
[1:30:55] 20 minute lunch period. I said, "I'm
[1:30:56] giving you 30.
[1:31:00] I'm going to go ahead and give you 30
[1:31:01] minute lunch." I said, "Instead of
[1:31:04] 10-minute breaks, I'm giving you 15.
[1:31:06] I'll let you use
[1:31:09] my company office to come in and call
[1:31:11] home if you need to, if it's important."
[1:31:13] I said, "But if you abuse it, you lose
[1:31:15] it." And I said, "So any of you come in
[1:31:19] here and I catch you just abusing the
[1:31:22] right that I give you." I said, 'Then
[1:31:25] everyone loses it. So I said, "So all of
[1:31:28] you are put on a disciplinary action you
[1:31:32] have to keep yourself because if you
[1:31:35] abuse it, all the rest of the guys,
[1:31:37] everybody here will lose it." And so it
[1:31:41] wound up that by God's grace,
[1:31:45] it wound up that we got these guys and
[1:31:47] and you know what? It turned them into a
[1:31:50] a real operating machine. And we did
[1:31:54] well.
[1:31:55] And they even said, "Ron, we'd like you
[1:31:59] to go to corporate headquarters and tell
[1:32:02] the people how that you've made your
[1:32:06] second shift warehouse crew as efficient
[1:32:09] as what they are." And I just told him,
[1:32:12] I said, "I am not a babysitter. I am
[1:32:15] going." And one of the first line
[1:32:17] supervisors came out because usually at
[1:32:19] 4 or 5:00, everybody in front office
[1:32:21] goes. Second shift is from 3 to 11. So
[1:32:26] we kind of had it our so very seldom do
[1:32:28] we have anybody from the front office.
[1:32:30] All the managers and warehouse manager
[1:32:32] and personnel manager and them come but
[1:32:35] we had the personnel manager came and
[1:32:38] and our break uh room was above. We had
[1:32:40] to go upstairs into a break room and my
[1:32:44] office was downstairs. So he sat in my
[1:32:47] office and you know exactly when you
[1:32:50] have your lunch and everything and he
[1:32:52] saw went 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30
[1:32:56] minutes. And so he's he's upset. He's
[1:32:59] very upset. Ron, Ron, your guys are 10
[1:33:02] minutes overdue. I said, "Yes, sir. I
[1:33:05] gave him that opportunity. I'm doing
[1:33:07] it." And I said, "When our
[1:33:10] efficiency drops," I said, "Come tell
[1:33:13] me." I said, "You know what? Otherwise,
[1:33:15] you give them 20 minutes, they're going
[1:33:17] to sit out here and talk on their
[1:33:19] forklift to one another and this and
[1:33:21] that and they're going to they're going
[1:33:22] to take the 10 minutes extra somewhere.
[1:33:25] I said, I give it to him. And he said,
[1:33:28] "Okay, all right, Ron, but if your
[1:33:31] efficiency drop," it didn't. It went up.
[1:33:35] You see, saints of God, and here's
[1:33:36] here's what I say with all of you. I
[1:33:38] don't want to be the the biggest
[1:33:40] babysitter of a church within the
[1:33:42] message. No, I give you all adult
[1:33:45] responsibility.
[1:33:47] You know what you got to do. You know
[1:33:49] the responsibility. You know you should
[1:33:51] come to church. You know you should be
[1:33:53] prayed up. You know these
[1:33:54] responsibilities. Yes, you've got kids.
[1:33:56] Yes, you've got a job. I understand all
[1:33:58] of the above. But Jesus said, "Seek ye
[1:34:02] first the kingdom of God. Here is a
[1:34:05] desire that I have always placed before
[1:34:07] God
[1:34:09] since God has placed me to be a pastor.
[1:34:12] Here's what I would like to have
[1:34:16] the highest percentage
[1:34:20] of people in my church to go in the
[1:34:22] rapture.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; That's what I would desire.
[1:34:35] Lord, let me preach to him
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; a little rough.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Let me be a drill instructor.
[1:34:41] Let me drill it into them. Let me be a
[1:34:45] good captain. Let me be a good leader
[1:34:50] that they would be good followers.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Because I couldn't think of a better
[1:34:58] legacy to leave as a pastor
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; than to say, "Brother Ron, you had
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; you had over 50% of your church went in
[1:35:08] the rapture because
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; two in bit
[1:35:12] One taken.
[1:35:14] Huh? Two at work, one taken. That's 50%.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; I'd like to have 70%.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; I'd like to say 100%, but I that's being
[1:35:31] I think foolish.
[1:35:33] So, I don't want to be foolish.
[1:35:36] But my desire is Oh, God help me. Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; That I might help your people.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest quotes that I've
[1:35:45] seen of the prophet
[1:35:48] and you have to hear it on the way that
[1:35:50] he says it.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "Lord, let your people love
[1:35:55] me."
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Wow. And he said it with such a meaning.
[1:35:59] Lord,
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; let your people love me
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; that I can bring them to you.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:12] Saints, I I I would love for you to love
[1:36:14] me
[1:36:16] because I'll bring you to him
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; because if you'll seek first the kingdom
[1:36:20] of God, musicians, if you come, coffee
[1:36:23] is ended.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; I'm tired.
[1:36:31] It's not easy to go over.
[1:36:35] We went into two countries. We spoke
[1:36:40] It's rough. I was gone only 12 days and
[1:36:43] three of those days are just in transit.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; The rest of the time you're in services.
[1:36:50] That's not easy. And the older I get,
[1:36:52] Sandy and I on our way home. And we kind
[1:36:54] of say this all the time. I ain't never
[1:36:58] going so far away again.
[1:37:03] Yeah. you say Lord willing because uh
[1:37:08] but I'll tell you when we were over
[1:37:10] there and I'll share with you this the
[1:37:15] little group there in Shanghai which if
[1:37:17] you look at
[1:37:20] the country of Thailand you put your
[1:37:22] finger on the very northern part that's
[1:37:24] Shang Mai the southern part is Bangkok
[1:37:28] and then there's a little appendage of
[1:37:31] land that goes down to Fuket
[1:37:33] which is your tourist spot that you know
[1:37:35] along the ocean and everybody everybody
[1:37:37] wants to go along the ocean
[1:37:41] and brother Malcolm Wano who has a real
[1:37:44] heart for mission he's gone there and
[1:37:47] let me tell you this guy
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:52] he goes out and wins new converts and
[1:37:54] everything and and so we went there and
[1:37:56] we kind of thought this is you know a
[1:37:59] whole church of of believers
[1:38:02] No, they were new Christians
[1:38:05] just come out of Buddhism. Some of them
[1:38:08] a month, couple weeks.
[1:38:13] Wow.
[1:38:14] You know what it's like
[1:38:17] to meet new Christians that are just in
[1:38:20] love with him, that don't have a clue
[1:38:22] about the way to dress and all of that.
[1:38:26] They just love him.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And so, you just start talking about God
[1:38:30] and how that you love him. and they look
[1:38:32] at us and they look at our wives and
[1:38:34] they see we're dressed different. What
[1:38:37] makes you different?
[1:38:39] Um, one thing, what is it? If you love
[1:38:42] me,
[1:38:45] you keep my commitment.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I said, I'm just in love.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; That's all. Wow. So the next thing you
[1:38:52] know
[1:38:54] this pastor,
[1:38:56] Pastor San,
[1:38:59] he he said, "My people would like you to
[1:39:02] pray for them." Do you know when you go
[1:39:05] through the book of Acts, you know, one
[1:39:07] of the greatest things that you see the
[1:39:08] disciples doing is they pray for people,
[1:39:13] lay hands on them,
[1:39:17] go, they're delivered of spirits. We had
[1:39:22] There was one guy and he said, "Oh, I'm
[1:39:24] I'm hurting so so bad here. I I I can't
[1:39:27] hardly move. Would you pray? Would would
[1:39:30] you pray? I I need God to touch me."
[1:39:33] Okay. So, we've got pictures of it. I go
[1:39:36] and I lay my hands and we all other new
[1:39:40] Christian believers, they're they're
[1:39:42] hands out like this just and they're
[1:39:45] praying behind us. and brother Mario and
[1:39:48] I and the local pastor and different
[1:39:50] ones were laying hands on and I reached
[1:39:52] down and I put my hand on the spot where
[1:39:55] he said he was hurting. I said, "Father,
[1:39:58] in the name of Jesus."
[1:40:04] I said, "God
[1:40:06] touch this me." And the next thing you
[1:40:09] know, he's going, "Oh, look, look, look.
[1:40:12] Oh, I'm healed. Healed. Healed."
[1:40:16] How many believe that God, if you'll
[1:40:18] just have faith in God,
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; these signs shall follow them that
[1:40:28] believe.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I love him. Don't you?
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:34] God help us
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; to not let the snares of Ladya and the
[1:40:39] deceitfulness of riches rob you.
[1:40:44] choke the very life of God out of you
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; if you're not careful. It's so easy to
[1:40:50] happen.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; You just become a little
[1:40:55] lukewarm
[1:41:01] pleasures of life.
[1:41:04] Oh, next thing you know, you just your
[1:41:08] spirituality is being choked out of you.
[1:41:13] What happened to all the people? Where'd
[1:41:15] they go?
[1:41:19] Many of those that did run.
[1:41:23] My wife and I have been reading the
[1:41:25] seven church age book and we're
[1:41:28] we've been going through and I'm
[1:41:30] probably going to preach on this on
[1:41:31] Sunday morning.
[1:41:35] And it says, "And the fire of God,
[1:41:40] if it's lit, if you don't refuel it,
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; you'll turn from fire unto a form.
[1:41:50] You're just a form of religion."
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; So I think I'll preach Sunday morning
[1:41:58] from fire to form.
[1:42:02] God,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; don't let me become a form.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; You cannot get warm
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; by a painted fire.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just say it.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; I want to experience it.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; I want to be on fire
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; of God that other people can see it in
[1:42:26] our lives.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; How about you? Y
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; is that your desire?
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Maybe.
[1:42:35] And I I got home and I thought, you know
[1:42:39] what?
[1:42:40] Maybe I'll play a tape tonight because
[1:42:43] I'm so tired around 10 11 o'clock during
[1:42:47] the day. My eyes are crossing. I can't
[1:42:50] hardly see it. I'm thinking, why why did
[1:42:52] I say I'll take Wednesday night service
[1:42:54] and ah
[1:42:57] like this and you're just Any of you
[1:43:00] that's traveled internationally, you
[1:43:03] know what I'm talking about.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; It's not easy. You're in a different
[1:43:07] time zone
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; in your body. And your time zone coming
[1:43:12] back is much harder. You know why?
[1:43:14] Because you're at home.
[1:43:17] You're in your house.
[1:43:20] And so if you want to get up, you can.
[1:43:21] If you're in somebody else's house or
[1:43:23] somewhere, you know, you just kind of
[1:43:26] lay there and suffer. it at home. So
[1:43:28] anyway,
[1:43:31] I do love all of you.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; And this little thought,
[1:43:43] let it be your desire.
[1:43:48] Don't let the cares of life,
[1:43:51] the pleasures of life, that wasn't sin.
[1:43:54] eating, drinking, pleasures of life,
[1:43:57] cares of life. Yeah, but the Bible says
[1:44:00] if you don't provide for your family,
[1:44:02] but didn't say you had to have the
[1:44:04] biggest and best.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; The cares of life choke out the seed.
[1:44:13] Nothing wrong with the seed. It's where
[1:44:15] it's planted.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; And I ask all of you, how is your
[1:44:18] ground? Is it thorny? Is it stony
[1:44:22] ground? Is it on the way side? How about
[1:44:24] good ground, Lord? Let thy word be hid
[1:44:28] in the good ground of my heart.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Not just 30, not just 60, but 100fold.
[1:44:38] Let's stand together this evening. God
[1:44:41] bless you. Brother Mark, would you lead
[1:44:44] us in this song, please?
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; This is my desire to honor you. This is

[1:49:20] again.
