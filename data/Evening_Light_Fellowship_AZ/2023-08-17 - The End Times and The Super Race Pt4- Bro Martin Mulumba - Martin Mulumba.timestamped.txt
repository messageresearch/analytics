[37:16] sound in your
[37:18] [Music]
[37:24] in your sorry pray
[37:27] Heavenly Father
[37:28] once again in thy presence Lord we stand
[37:31] in your ability
[37:34] understanding it's not about might not
[37:37] by power but by the spirits of the Lord
[37:40] as Lord are we standing and
[37:43] understanding
[37:45] that it's because of your love that
[37:48] we're standing in this hour
[37:50] if it wasn't no father God for the shed
[37:53] blood
[37:55] we would be cast out
[37:58] [Music]
[38:01] lost in the darkness of this world
[38:05] but it plays you because you loved us so
[38:08] much
[38:08] [Music]
[38:11] chose to come down to leave all the
[38:14] Splendor of Heaven
[38:17] to come to our rescue father
[38:21] and in this hour you have chosen low
[38:23] father to come down again Lord
[38:27] because we looked for you
[38:29] we search for you
[38:31] with our own ways and we couldn't find
[38:34] you
[38:36] but Lord when we left all these things
[38:39] and
[38:41] then you came to our old rescue father
[38:44] [Music]
[38:46] by disgrace message
[38:48] that has been able Lord little
[38:52] bring our heart back low father
[38:55] to our position lost position father
[38:59] therefore Lord that's why we're saying
[39:03] we love you Lord
[39:04] yes thank you Father for this grace
[39:08] thank you Father for this message
[39:11] thank you for bringing out low father
[39:14] God a prophet
[39:16] many little father we see in the world
[39:19] are finding their own ways
[39:21] to be able of Father God to get to you
[39:23] father
[39:25] but Esther could sit low father God in
[39:28] the palace
[39:29] and being grateful to have had one
[39:32] who knew
[39:34] what the king wanted father
[39:36] we are so grateful in this hour
[39:40] help us Lord in humility to stay in our
[39:43] position
[39:45] and to follow father God the pattern and
[39:47] the instructions
[39:50] because one of these days as we see the
[39:52] father God the world
[39:55] getting shaken Lord by earthquakes and
[39:59] all kinds of things
[40:01] but Lord unto us shalom
[40:04] [Music]
[40:05] lead us Lord along the way
[40:08] as we look away unto you
[40:11] we ask all these things in Thanksgiving
[40:15] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[40:20] may God bless you
[40:23] thank you musicians
[40:27] well we're still standing we're going to
[40:30] take our Bibles
[40:34] was still in the Book of Luke 22
[40:39] I know these two verses are taking a lot
[40:42] longer to go through but by God's grace
[40:45] will be able to
[40:47] get to it as much as as soon as possible
[40:53] 22 24
[40:57] and there was also a try a strive among
[41:00] them meaning the disciples which of them
[41:03] should be accounted the greatest and he
[41:05] said unto them the kings of the Gentiles
[41:08] exercise leadership over them
[41:10] and they that exercise Authority upon
[41:13] them are called benefactors
[41:15] may God bless the reading of his word
[41:17] you may be seated
[41:21] but he shall not be so verse 26
[41:26] but he that is greatest among you let
[41:29] him be as the younger as he that is
[41:33] Chief as he that don't serve for whether
[41:36] he is greater he does he have admit or
[41:39] he that serveth is not he does he
[41:42] reflect me but I am among you as he that
[41:46] serveth yea a day which have continued
[41:50] with me in my Temptations and I appoint
[41:54] you unto a kingdom as my father hath
[41:58] appointed unto me that ye may eat and
[42:01] drink at my table in my kingdom and sit
[42:05] on Thrones judging do 12 tribes of
[42:09] Israel
[42:10] we are still in the thoughts of
[42:14] the end times and the super race
[42:18] but God grace this will be part four
[42:22] as a
[42:24] we
[42:27] 've seen it tried to bring it
[42:30] but God's grace into all these stages
[42:36] the coming of the Lord in Babylon will
[42:39] try to get to that so it makes sense
[42:41] down the road
[42:42] so that it's not any confusion because
[42:45] all these things are in the message but
[42:47] God's grace
[42:50] we
[42:52] thank brother Ron once again for the
[42:55] opportunity
[42:57] to be able to stand here and as you just
[43:02] said earlier to practice
[43:05] rather than just sitting on the pews and
[43:08] also goes the same way as Jesus said
[43:10] that the one that serveth
[43:12] we also want to serve as much as
[43:15] possible
[43:16] the Lord also has been keeping me a
[43:19] little busy
[43:20] up and down in Mexico almost every other
[43:24] week
[43:26] it's uh quite uh
[43:29] quite an interesting chapter of my life
[43:33] after he had uh who wanted me to
[43:36] relocate
[43:38] uh I wasn't expecting it as much
[43:42] but you pray for me if you don't see me
[43:46] around
[43:47] just be aware that I should be somewhere
[43:50] in the country or somewhere in Mexico as
[43:53] the Lord leads
[43:55] yeah man yeah because I've been around
[43:58] this some of the brothers like we've we
[44:00] haven't seen you we haven't seen you
[44:02] just at least be aware I thought maybe I
[44:06] should because I've always been
[44:07] communicating with brother Ron but not
[44:10] as much with the church you forgive me
[44:12] for that
[44:13] uh so at least you know that uh I'm not
[44:16] just out there just not running away
[44:19] from Services instead
[44:22] with God's grace amen uh the end times
[44:26] and the super race
[44:29] we have been uh seeing as Jesus was
[44:32] dealing with the disciples
[44:34] he's been drawing them from the
[44:38] perception where they found them among
[44:40] themselves as Believers of their message
[44:42] of the hour we have seen illegal Prophet
[44:45] who have seen the revelation of the son
[44:48] of man and
[44:50] they got among themselves then they
[44:52] started thinking who is greater among
[44:54] Among Us and Jesus saying that it is
[44:57] starting now to explain to them where
[44:59] they came from and we tried to see that
[45:01] in the last few Services how the
[45:04] cultures and how Nimrod came about and
[45:07] things and uh we went about and uh we
[45:12] brought it along the church ages to show
[45:15] that these disciples among them there
[45:19] were also some unconverted Bunch who
[45:22] were people who were converts of
[45:26] Messengers who have brought messages
[45:28] along the church ages just as we also
[45:31] have in the church the three types of
[45:33] Believers the Believers the unbelievers
[45:37] and they make Believers and in this
[45:41] situation we find that these three types
[45:44] of believers they are part of the Bride
[45:47] they are part of the message they are
[45:49] part of
[45:50] the what is called the message of the
[45:53] hour not because they've chosen to be
[45:57] that but a God wanted it to be so
[45:59] because each one of us didn't just
[46:02] choose to stumble upon the message
[46:04] because we can see
[46:06] people in the world that have been
[46:09] crying out to God every day like you
[46:12] know show me the way but they just like
[46:14] you know lose their life just as brother
[46:16] Branham speak about Marilyn Monroe share
[46:19] before her death she was crying out and
[46:21] the god revealed it unto him he said
[46:24] that I know if I can get to her but God
[46:27] didn't allow it so therefore it is a
[46:29] privilege that God has granted unto us
[46:32] to come about the message and not only
[46:36] to be in the church called that we
[46:40] believe the prophet but also we have
[46:42] went on to be the True Believers and we
[46:46] have the Revelation to be the bride so
[46:49] you understand that you know that
[46:51] separation is quite important that the
[46:54] church attendance is not just a place
[46:57] where you come you listen to A good
[46:59] sermon because all of us will be
[47:01] listening to the sermons but then the
[47:03] unbeliever will just like you know shag
[47:05] it off and move on with their life
[47:08] continually but for the bride as these
[47:11] things are coming out they just get them
[47:13] closer and closer and closer and they're
[47:16] becoming it becomes more real and you
[47:19] look around you say you then you start
[47:21] to become aware as well speaks about the
[47:24] young lady when the young man from
[47:27] Chicago went to Colorado to seek a wife
[47:30] uh he give her a sign that you know upon
[47:34] around this time you see this you'll see
[47:36] these events start taking place then you
[47:39] know that I should be coming down while
[47:42] the rest of the cousins were sitting
[47:43] there standing or say like you know why
[47:45] are you dressing like that why are you
[47:46] doing this why are you doing that you
[47:48] know you're not even a classical people
[47:50] you're not you don't have a sorority out
[47:54] there you're not well known out there
[47:57] but then her mind was focused because
[47:59] there was a communication that had taken
[48:02] place and that communication to us today
[48:04] is the message of the hour and as the
[48:07] message has been given unto us now we
[48:09] have so much information that when you
[48:12] sit and you look around what happens in
[48:14] the news what a brother says what a man
[48:18] who backs their lives around you that
[48:20] was something and all that just awakens
[48:23] you makes you understand that you know
[48:26] this is the hour he told me that when
[48:28] you see this then pay attention to days
[48:31] and but that's great so that's where now
[48:33] ministers come into play they have a
[48:36] role to take these things and reverse
[48:39] them say them back and Echo them back
[48:41] and back again so that wherever where we
[48:45] find the Lord be discouraged and where
[48:47] we find a little bit uh trying to give
[48:50] up but these things are given unto us so
[48:53] for us to be strengthened as we go along
[48:55] the way
[48:56] we see that um
[48:59] the along the church ages or along the
[49:03] time Nimrod when it came about or his
[49:05] Spirit the devil and all these things it
[49:08] came about he had the people that have
[49:11] found a way in the church and has
[49:13] defined a way in the church and uh they
[49:16] were not converted people all they
[49:19] wanted to have the appearance of being
[49:21] Christians they could dress like
[49:23] Christians they could talk like
[49:25] Christians they could be fundamentally
[49:27] like you know very white he has all the
[49:30] scriptures to defend his position he has
[49:34] all these things but that was not
[49:36] following God's program why because they
[49:39] were not a bride but then at the same
[49:41] time it was very important for the bride
[49:44] to be aware of what these people were
[49:47] doing so that it's not just like oh I
[49:50] also know this quotation I also know
[49:52] that then there's just like you know no
[49:55] difference between knowing the message
[49:58] like anybody it can have access to the
[50:01] app or anything and the revelation of
[50:03] what is really taking place because
[50:05] brother Bonham shows us that bellam also
[50:08] had the altars they had the Lambs and
[50:12] speaking of the coming of the Lord and
[50:14] and all these things here but the
[50:16] difference between this the children of
[50:18] Israel were on God's program unto to the
[50:22] promised land but these ones here the
[50:25] reason of having all these altars and
[50:27] having all these things was just to make
[50:30] themselves a name and make themselves
[50:32] money so we find that that was what
[50:35] Nimrod wanted also to do he also had the
[50:39] three purposes to make himself a name
[50:42] his own religion and build a strong
[50:44] Nation by dividing the people and all
[50:46] these things that we can see that in the
[50:49] society in which we are living in today
[50:51] we have all this there's some things
[50:54] repeating again but then at the same
[50:56] time now Jesus turns around and says he
[50:59] shall not be so and when he said he
[51:03] shall not be so he has to show them what
[51:05] exactly that he says that he shall not
[51:08] be so that's why we see that sorry verse
[51:11] 25 he says like the kings of the
[51:14] Gentiles we saw cultures we saw
[51:16] countries we saw all these things a lot
[51:19] of ship over them and they that exercise
[51:22] Authority upon them which are the
[51:24] Gentiles are called benefactors why are
[51:27] they called benefactors we saw that
[51:30] when the unbelievers who were part of
[51:34] the message of the hour went and got
[51:38] married with the world with the church
[51:42] and with the politics then they became
[51:45] very powerful they had All the Monies
[51:47] they were able to control all the
[51:49] systems so
[51:52] um Ezra Branham says a Sumerian Church
[51:56] age program 76 now
[52:00] the introduction now Simeon means a
[52:03] business and comes from the word Mayor
[52:06] the first church age had lost the first
[52:08] love issue of Ephesian Church age and
[52:11] this church had begun to have a root of
[52:14] bitterness coming up in them because
[52:16] that this church the main Church the big
[52:20] part of majority of them was hammering
[52:23] against the Holy Spirit ruling in the
[52:25] church and they wanted to rule
[52:27] themselves they wanted to set a
[52:30] priesthood they wanted to act like the
[52:32] Old Testament people they wanted a
[52:35] priests if the pagan gods but they were
[52:39] they was converted they had priests and
[52:42] so forth and Jupiter and and Priests of
[52:44] Venice and so forth they wanted to bring
[52:47] them the the same thing to make these
[52:50] men in other words what we saw yesterday
[52:53] depending you can even see that in other
[52:56] parts of the country of the world that
[52:59] or even in the country tree you'll still
[53:01] have like you know people will still go
[53:03] bow before statutes and all these things
[53:05] but the progression of that spirit is
[53:08] still the same thing that after bowing
[53:12] before the statues and then they turned
[53:15] those into men and these men we call
[53:18] them as a president and you know this
[53:21] president has the right mindset he's the
[53:23] one who can change the economy and and
[53:26] everybody prays like oh we want this
[53:30] here we think like you know this is the
[53:33] one who can really change the whole
[53:34] thing but then for the bride when we
[53:37] look at God's program our prayer changes
[53:40] because to some extent the prophet will
[53:42] say like you know and we don't even pray
[53:44] for this country anymore because the
[53:47] country has taken a position and that
[53:49] position just set the course of the
[53:53] country just to Doom but then the rest
[53:56] of the society is like you know we're
[53:58] going to make America great again
[54:00] according to what scripture
[54:03] you know so when you when we understand
[54:06] human beings at times we just say you
[54:09] see the foolishness of men and you say
[54:12] like you know we have the greatest
[54:13] schools around but then by God's grace
[54:16] that's why we thank God for the message
[54:18] when you look at this and you say like
[54:21] you know all these promises will you may
[54:24] go to China you may go to Africa you may
[54:26] go wherever you want to be you see the
[54:29] same thing happening everywhere
[54:31] everybody is looking for a good
[54:34] president that can change the life that
[54:36] can increase the the minimum wage and
[54:39] that can have the best medical care out
[54:43] there but then at the end we see that
[54:45] all these are tied to the three
[54:47] dimensions that will just put you back
[54:49] in the grave again and there's no way
[54:52] out of it there's no president that has
[54:54] promised that you know if you vote for
[54:56] me by the time you die and after three
[54:58] days you're going to have a new body
[54:59] none
[55:01] but then these are the people who had
[55:04] all this money all these resources and
[55:08] they were unable to do anything and
[55:10] stuff and uh Branham
[55:13] uh shows us here in the programming
[55:17] Church age paragraph 62. now the
[55:20] Nicolaitans then had the formal side
[55:24] they had and they married the Pagan
[55:27] Pagan Church bringing in Pagan altars
[55:30] making Christian altars brought in a
[55:33] pagan God and made it speak and talk in
[55:37] form of the bishop president all that we
[55:40] want to call them both at work and all
[55:43] these things because many times we
[55:45] worship our bosses we love them so much
[55:48] like you know we run away from service
[55:49] but we can go so we can go to work set
[55:52] up there and rubbed it up and make it
[55:55] look like a god you see brother says you
[55:58] see no it's not what's on the outside
[56:02] it's what on the inside them two grains
[56:06] of cones looked the same it wasn't what
[56:10] was on the outside it was what was on on
[56:14] the inside because these two Spirits as
[56:18] we said at the last service that they
[56:21] just look like any one of us
[56:24] a politician would dress like any one of
[56:26] us the Catholic nuns will dress even at
[56:29] times better than our sisters because
[56:31] they have all this dress code and all
[56:34] these things but then the live inside
[56:37] was a whole different life and why would
[56:41] they be were they able to dress that way
[56:45] because they were also part of the
[56:46] church
[56:48] because they would have access to the
[56:50] Bible they have access to the message
[56:53] they can dress like that they can look
[56:55] like any one of us but the life behind
[56:57] the purpose the powerful thoughts they
[57:00] have it's a whole different program than
[57:03] what God has
[57:05] and this was now happening also in the
[57:07] church and Jesus said no you shall not
[57:09] be so
[57:10] you cannot be in the Church of the
[57:13] Living God and having all these powerful
[57:15] thoughts that I'm going to make myself a
[57:17] name I'm going to build a strong Nation
[57:19] I am going to do this here forgetting
[57:22] what God purpose is as is for our lives
[57:26] and he says see the inside the life well
[57:30] it was made there and that was the birth
[57:33] birthplace of early Catholic Church was
[57:37] the matter of all denominations
[57:39] paragraph 259 went dead fixed up this
[57:44] big thing all I want to tell you was
[57:47] have uh I want to tell you what had
[57:50] happened so that you will understand
[57:52] that was the birth of post
[57:56] millenniums because the church had
[57:59] gotten rich and it was as as rich as it
[58:03] could be and it was what powerful it was
[58:08] overstate State and church together so
[58:12] now the what I wanted to get to uh I had
[58:15] to recap a little bit because the what I
[58:18] wanted to get to is was that the systems
[58:20] that they used because along the age we
[58:23] have to understand for them to be able
[58:25] to govern the entire world and lead the
[58:28] things the way they're leading them God
[58:31] had to give them the opportunity to have
[58:34] certain agendas to have certain spirits
[58:37] to have certain political systems to
[58:41] have all kinds of things out there for
[58:43] them to be able to rule and by having
[58:46] these things in place then they were
[58:48] going to be able to fulfill this year
[58:50] because even it makes you fall standing
[58:53] with Jesus they said like you know all
[58:55] these kingdoms of the world belong to me
[58:57] if you just worship me I will give it to
[59:00] you that's what we see in our days each
[59:03] one of us is first to die with that same
[59:05] challenge depending on your level you
[59:08] can be a child you could be a mother you
[59:10] could be a father and any one of us we
[59:14] also face the very same challenge
[59:16] because when we face those uh political
[59:20] systems and they tell you for you to
[59:23] become this you need to follow this path
[59:25] for you to be this you need to follow
[59:27] this path here but then by God's grace
[59:29] when we see all those political systems
[59:32] when we see all these things they make
[59:35] us aware to understand that once I put
[59:38] my foot I choose this pathway this is
[59:42] what is going to happen to me
[59:44] and that turns our mind into a certain
[59:48] way we start speaking in that manner we
[59:52] start looking at our fellows in a
[59:55] certain manner because we have embraced
[59:58] those systems
[1:00:00] either because we grew up in an
[1:00:03] environment with that system without
[1:00:05] even knowing it from
[1:00:08] birth until 15 years old before you able
[1:00:12] to make your own decisions then all this
[1:00:15] year you reactions your speech and your
[1:00:19] mindset your perception of life is
[1:00:21] affected by what you've learned from
[1:00:24] those systems and those systems the word
[1:00:27] shows us here
[1:00:28] um teritarian Church age paragraph 133
[1:00:31] make an image to her what would it be
[1:00:35] just what they're doing right now just
[1:00:38] exactly moving up the in this
[1:00:41] confederation of churches all the
[1:00:43] churches belong belong to this
[1:00:45] organization all into one group now
[1:00:48] they're getting uh they get the getting
[1:00:51] a Bible
[1:00:53] and Pope John invited them all back the
[1:00:57] aashi bishop Canterbury all going around
[1:00:59] first thing you know the whole thing
[1:01:01] comes right back to Mommy because there
[1:01:05] are lots to begin with see they say
[1:01:07] We'll join together in one big cause in
[1:01:12] one big in one big cause to fight
[1:01:15] communism and don't you know that God
[1:01:18] raise up communism I can prove it by by
[1:01:20] this bubble even and even put the minds
[1:01:25] to avenge the the the Saints and the
[1:01:28] blood that had shed upon the Earth God
[1:01:31] organized communism just as
[1:01:35] um just just the same as he did King
[1:01:38] Nebuchadnezzar to Israel he raised
[1:01:40] communism and someday should blow Roma
[1:01:44] Plum of Roman Plum of the earth that's
[1:01:48] exactly God said God said so that's
[1:01:50] right I'm against communism it's
[1:01:53] anti-god so it is but don't you pay so
[1:01:56] much attention to that Iron Curtain
[1:01:58] listen to this but watch that purple
[1:02:02] curtain
[1:02:04] what is brother Branham showing us he
[1:02:06] said like you know look at where that
[1:02:08] name wrote that whistle came into the
[1:02:12] church into nicolaidism turned into
[1:02:15] balaamism then turning into the religion
[1:02:19] of Jezebel that's what we call the
[1:02:22] Catholic system and the Catholic system
[1:02:25] is from Daniel's vision from that
[1:02:29] Catholic system into the entire world
[1:02:33] but then how does it get into the entire
[1:02:36] world he doesn't show up to everyone's
[1:02:39] Dole say like you know hey I am Jezebel
[1:02:42] and you have to join my system no
[1:02:45] that's the beauty of the message
[1:02:48] because anybody can read that quotation
[1:02:50] it's just like you know yeah they're
[1:02:51] talking about Rome and we are not in
[1:02:53] Rome so I'm not in Catholic Church no
[1:02:57] that's the beauty that the when you look
[1:03:00] at the message you say like you know
[1:03:01] Lord you love that so much
[1:03:05] and this world now
[1:03:08] this is where uh brother brought him
[1:03:12] shows it now the reason why I chose
[1:03:14] they're the title of the coming of the
[1:03:16] Lord in Babylon probably I will explain
[1:03:19] it even better uh God willing next time
[1:03:22] but here now we find that the Catholic
[1:03:25] system or romanism
[1:03:27] had went off
[1:03:30] teaching people
[1:03:32] the rules of hearts and rules of
[1:03:36] architecture and all these wonderful
[1:03:38] things and now depending on where you
[1:03:41] are in the world
[1:03:44] the level of access
[1:03:47] of romanism
[1:03:49] will Define
[1:03:51] the amplitude of Genesis 11.
[1:03:56] let me repeat that
[1:03:59] the level of access of romanism you have
[1:04:02] in the place where you have
[1:04:05] will determine the amplitude
[1:04:07] of Genesis 11. because remember in
[1:04:11] Genesis 11 that's when the Lord came
[1:04:13] down to see what the sons of man have
[1:04:18] built
[1:04:20] so now everywhere in the world you go
[1:04:23] that you see that not everything is at
[1:04:25] the same level
[1:04:27] some people are more advanced than
[1:04:28] others
[1:04:29] and what we call Advance today it's
[1:04:32] romanism
[1:04:34] because the Romans are the ones who have
[1:04:37] taught us
[1:04:39] how to build
[1:04:41] how to go about certain things
[1:04:46] when you go to Washington DC
[1:04:49] you can see all the buildings
[1:04:52] are made according to the pattern of
[1:04:55] Rome
[1:04:58] you see that brother Burnham shows us
[1:05:00] that
[1:05:02] America is the image
[1:05:06] of Rome
[1:05:09] but Roman itself is Europe
[1:05:12] where the founders of America were going
[1:05:16] back to Europe retrieving all the
[1:05:19] knowledge in order to build a better
[1:05:22] system than what they had experienced
[1:05:26] in Europe
[1:05:27] but by them doing such they were just
[1:05:31] fulfilling the scripture to build an
[1:05:34] image unto the Beast
[1:05:40] by building a system like an unto the
[1:05:43] Beast so it is also with the message the
[1:05:47] word comes also to be the believer to
[1:05:50] make the images of Christ
[1:05:54] so when we are dealing with the word we
[1:05:58] are not dealing with it just for
[1:05:59] knowledge purposes but we are building
[1:06:02] to become like him
[1:06:06] as we think to be like Jesus and to be
[1:06:09] like Jesus we need to have more
[1:06:11] information in order for us to turn a
[1:06:15] lock onto him like Mordecai coming to
[1:06:18] Esther to teach her how to be like watch
[1:06:23] the king lights
[1:06:25] because the rest of the women in the
[1:06:28] palace they could dress up however the
[1:06:30] one based upon whatever they see is out
[1:06:33] there
[1:06:35] but then the Brady of the of the the
[1:06:38] message of the hour comes to the bride
[1:06:40] to find an available heart to receive in
[1:06:46] order to produce the word to turn us to
[1:06:50] be uh the turn into the images of Christ
[1:06:53] but then before we get into the part of
[1:06:55] the Bride which we shall take unto us
[1:06:58] down the road then we see now that
[1:07:01] romanism as it went about
[1:07:04] he went into Russia he went to into
[1:07:07] Europe he went into England he went into
[1:07:11] uh Spain with all of you who can who
[1:07:14] have access to history can see how that
[1:07:17] romanism system is spread across the
[1:07:21] world and we see that according to uh
[1:07:25] the church ages in the age of the open
[1:07:27] door that I'm saying that I'm giving you
[1:07:31] this opportunity I'm opening the door
[1:07:34] that no man can shut but always remember
[1:07:37] that when the Revival comes it always
[1:07:40] brings out two seeds the two seeds are
[1:07:43] always coming along every time there's a
[1:07:46] Revival so now when this revival of the
[1:07:49] open door came about this wrong seed or
[1:07:53] Nimrod also went about to conquer all
[1:07:56] the world
[1:07:58] but those Believers under the message of
[1:08:01] the hour are the ones who receive the
[1:08:04] messenger and the message always sealed
[1:08:07] away and waiting Upon Our times
[1:08:10] so now as we see now that Nimrod has
[1:08:13] come through the entire world what does
[1:08:15] it do it teaches now people three types
[1:08:19] of the main political systems that we
[1:08:22] see out there and we see that here in
[1:08:24] the laodicean church age brother Branham
[1:08:27] says uh in the leodician church age
[1:08:29] program say brother Branham says
[1:08:32] age began around the turn of the 20th
[1:08:36] century Proverbs 1906. how long will it
[1:08:38] last as a servant of God who had did
[1:08:41] multiple uh multiples of visions of
[1:08:45] which none has ever failed let me
[1:08:47] predict I did not prophesy but I predict
[1:08:50] that this age will end around 1977. if
[1:08:54] you will pardon as a personal note here
[1:08:56] at best these prediction on seven major
[1:09:01] continuous Vision that came to me one
[1:09:04] Sunday morning in June 1933
[1:09:07] as the prophet is standing there the
[1:09:11] Lord is coming down to find that this
[1:09:16] political system are not birthed
[1:09:20] at the time the prophet is receiving the
[1:09:23] vision
[1:09:24] but these political systems were already
[1:09:27] down the edges in forms of seeds wearing
[1:09:32] upon its manifestation and in order to
[1:09:36] fulfill the purpose of which God had
[1:09:39] wanted to fulfill his program
[1:09:42] because we can read about communism it
[1:09:46] didn't start with Russia
[1:09:47] but when when Karl Marx and all of them
[1:09:50] and went were sitting there and looking
[1:09:53] at every ideas that people were having
[1:09:55] they thought
[1:09:58] God allowed them to receive the thoughts
[1:10:01] in order for them to write those things
[1:10:04] and then certain countries will come and
[1:10:07] grab those things and in order to
[1:10:09] fulfill it that's what I said depending
[1:10:12] on the country where you at or where you
[1:10:14] are the access or the level or for the
[1:10:17] system of romanism will Define will
[1:10:21] determine the amplitude of Genesis 11
[1:10:24] because in Genesis 11 we'll get to it
[1:10:27] let me know rashma said get ahead of
[1:10:29] myself
[1:10:30] says here the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus
[1:10:33] spoke to me and said that the coming of
[1:10:36] the Lord was throwing nigh but that
[1:10:40] before he came
[1:10:41] seven major events will transpire you I
[1:10:45] wrote them all down
[1:10:46] um and that morning I gave I I gave
[1:10:49] forth the revelation of the Lord
[1:10:52] number one he says the vision was that
[1:10:54] was that Mussolini was would invade
[1:10:58] Ethiopia and that and and that Nation
[1:11:01] would fall as is at his steps
[1:11:04] the next Vision foretold that
[1:11:07] Austrian by name of other Adolf Hitler
[1:11:11] would rise up as a dictator over Germany
[1:11:14] and that he would draw the world into
[1:11:16] war
[1:11:17] now listen to this a third
[1:11:20] division the third Vision was the realm
[1:11:24] of
[1:11:25] excuse me was in the realm of uh in the
[1:11:29] in the realm of world politics for it
[1:11:32] shows me that there would be three great
[1:11:35] ISM fascism Nazism and communism
[1:11:40] but the first two would be swallowed up
[1:11:44] into the Third
[1:11:46] so now brother brought them now has his
[1:11:49] standing there in 1933 the Lord is now
[1:11:52] giving him all this information so that
[1:11:56] we may be aware
[1:11:58] of what is taking place because remember
[1:12:03] fascism and narcissism we see that back
[1:12:06] in Europe in a certain time in a certain
[1:12:09] period of time
[1:12:10] but then after a while the whole thing
[1:12:13] vanished but remember
[1:12:15] it's not because we don't speak about
[1:12:17] fascism and nationalism the word that
[1:12:22] the spirit has left
[1:12:24] because there's only two spirits
[1:12:28] the seed of God and the seed of
[1:12:30] discrepancy and this seed of discrepancy
[1:12:33] will take all steps of shape and forms
[1:12:36] but will still continue on just as we
[1:12:39] see in this uh in the Seven Seals we see
[1:12:42] that the very same Spirit the same first
[1:12:45] rose Rider that started as a white horse
[1:12:48] will turn into the red rose into a a
[1:12:52] black horse and into the Pearl holes but
[1:12:55] it's still the same Spirit continuing
[1:12:57] along the edges so it is now the semnim
[1:13:01] road taking the form of fascism taking
[1:13:04] the form of narcissism as we know in
[1:13:08] Germany and uh in Italy the purity of
[1:13:11] race and uh and against the Jews and all
[1:13:14] these things here but then you see that
[1:13:16] all these things gives takes us back to
[1:13:20] understand what Nimrod was doing back
[1:13:23] then to do what to make a name for
[1:13:27] himself
[1:13:28] because under these two first ones
[1:13:32] people thought that they were better
[1:13:35] than others
[1:13:37] that's what Jesus said that ye shall not
[1:13:41] be so
[1:13:44] because of the very same thing wherever
[1:13:47] you go in the world you may come from a
[1:13:50] one country uh in Africa in anywhere
[1:13:54] just like one of the brother was telling
[1:13:56] me that yeah you go to Africa people of
[1:13:58] tribe different tribes they kill each
[1:14:01] other you go in different parts of the
[1:14:03] world in South America like people kill
[1:14:06] each other on the streets and all this
[1:14:08] thing why because the very same spirit
[1:14:12] still rides on to think that they are
[1:14:15] better than others
[1:14:18] and the Lord now is opening unto us to
[1:14:22] see that hey look look at what is going
[1:14:25] to happen to those systems
[1:14:27] look it started somewhere it was very
[1:14:30] popular but look today we don't speak
[1:14:33] about it anymore but he says now I want
[1:14:36] you to watch where that is going
[1:14:40] because between that time we see that
[1:14:43] when the Fascism and narcissism had rise
[1:14:47] up and went down we also have things
[1:14:50] like socialism capitalism going around
[1:14:53] and doing its thing
[1:14:57] many of the
[1:14:59] European countries are are driven by
[1:15:03] socialism and and
[1:15:05] at times Africa though it's mainly
[1:15:09] driven by dictatorship and all these
[1:15:12] things but it's still the same spirit
[1:15:16] and this Same Spirit as we see it now
[1:15:19] under the capitalism we see that
[1:15:23] this big country
[1:15:25] had access for almost 400 years now that
[1:15:29] had they have access when you go into
[1:15:32] history you see how the Father the
[1:15:35] forefathers and they would request all
[1:15:37] these books from uh from you from Europe
[1:15:40] and to know how to learn and to know how
[1:15:43] to to spend the time and you read some
[1:15:47] funny stories that you know people at a
[1:15:50] very early stage of America people
[1:15:51] didn't even want to pay their taxes
[1:15:54] because they thought like you know no we
[1:15:56] left uh we left uh Europe and we were
[1:16:00] under the bridges uh suppression and you
[1:16:03] bringing us here to start paying our the
[1:16:05] taxes again we don't want this year
[1:16:08] but they'd had no choice but God's
[1:16:11] program had to be fulfilled and as the
[1:16:14] time went on this system of capitalism
[1:16:18] also went and crossed along the world
[1:16:21] why because God said that this is the
[1:16:25] nation
[1:16:26] that drunkens the entire world that
[1:16:30] brings that makes the people of the
[1:16:32] world wander
[1:16:34] as one would say back in Africa to say
[1:16:37] before to get to heaven you have to get
[1:16:39] to America first
[1:16:41] why because what they see on TV doesn't
[1:16:46] look like here on Earth
[1:16:49] because they can see the road systems
[1:16:51] because when we recall in the Bible in
[1:16:54] the time of uh Nebuchadnezzar he could
[1:16:56] have roads and that would go from the
[1:16:59] East to the west of his kingdom and we
[1:17:03] also have these countries now
[1:17:05] we'll get to China by God's grace that
[1:17:08] we have that this world that you see all
[1:17:12] the roles and beautiful things and you
[1:17:15] know you look around you back in the
[1:17:17] country where you could be you say like
[1:17:18] what kind of government do we have don't
[1:17:21] you when people you travel to those
[1:17:23] countries don't you see what they do
[1:17:27] you see so now the level of access
[1:17:30] of romanism
[1:17:32] determines the amplitude of Genesis 11.
[1:17:37] so now let's go back now to Genesis 11 I
[1:17:40] I had touched on it couple uh weeks back
[1:17:43] but
[1:17:45] um
[1:17:45] I couldn't
[1:17:47] really get to it as much but God's grace
[1:17:50] says he allows it to for us today we'll
[1:17:52] be able to go
[1:17:54] uh to get to wait as much as we can
[1:17:57] verse one and the whole Earth
[1:18:00] was of one language and not of one
[1:18:02] speech and it came to pass
[1:18:04] Journey from the
[1:18:06] e remember even also America
[1:18:10] we started from the East with the 13
[1:18:13] colonies and we went all the way to the
[1:18:17] West that's why we have the saying of
[1:18:19] the uh what West it's a a speech that
[1:18:24] people find them under themselves they
[1:18:25] say like you know oh we like this saying
[1:18:27] so much but they don't realize that this
[1:18:31] what God is programmed
[1:18:35] for nimro to be able to do Anna to what
[1:18:38] extent is going to do it has been
[1:18:41] written in the word but to us
[1:18:45] As Americans we find it like you know oh
[1:18:48] look at what we've done
[1:18:51] and that this now will be a pardon or a
[1:18:54] sample for the rest of the world
[1:18:57] you see now that you know the rest of
[1:18:59] the world we want to be like America
[1:19:02] everything that America does the entire
[1:19:05] world wants to follow except for few
[1:19:08] countries of course for the reason why
[1:19:10] God wanted it to be that way in order
[1:19:13] for his program to come about
[1:19:16] and it came to pass as the journey from
[1:19:19] the East that they found a plane in the
[1:19:22] land of China uh we would say like you
[1:19:24] know in the land of America and they
[1:19:26] dwell there and they said one to another
[1:19:29] God too let us make brick
[1:19:32] and burn them
[1:19:34] truthfully and they had breakfast thorns
[1:19:37] and slime had a day for Morrow now we
[1:19:41] see now that as people were Journey from
[1:19:44] one part of the land into another Port
[1:19:47] they have now they had to have access to
[1:19:51] know how to make brick
[1:19:53] they had to learn how to make slime and
[1:19:58] and how to have the the chemistry
[1:20:01] knowledge in order to mix
[1:20:05] the molecules and and all these elements
[1:20:09] in order for them to achieve this great
[1:20:13] mind or this great thought they had in
[1:20:16] their minds
[1:20:19] remember they came about
[1:20:22] they destroyed the land
[1:20:25] the med Wars they call it colonies
[1:20:29] because they took over it was the edge
[1:20:32] of the open door and then from there now
[1:20:34] they have to build a kingdom
[1:20:40] and they say go to let us build us a
[1:20:44] city and a tower
[1:20:46] whose top May reach unto heaven
[1:20:51] we want to build a nation
[1:20:55] a nation where people rely on the
[1:20:58] intellect
[1:20:59] why because back
[1:21:02] in uh Europe especially in the UK
[1:21:06] for if you study history you'll see that
[1:21:10] what we have today is the King James
[1:21:12] version of the Bible is the result of
[1:21:16] the debate between the king and the
[1:21:19] people
[1:21:20] and as the people wanted access to the
[1:21:24] word so they had to have a compromise so
[1:21:27] that's why we call it the King James
[1:21:30] version
[1:21:32] so King James who was ruling at the time
[1:21:37] as a gift to the people he said like
[1:21:40] well we're going to give you a little
[1:21:42] bit of Freedom we're going to give you
[1:21:44] the word
[1:21:46] and by giving them the word people now
[1:21:49] had the understanding oh let us now have
[1:21:53] this freedom of worship
[1:21:55] let us now leave and go to a land where
[1:21:58] we can worship God
[1:22:00] but always remember as they were coming
[1:22:02] to this land with a Revival
[1:22:06] to worship God also the other seed was
[1:22:10] also following along with a different
[1:22:13] agenda
[1:22:14] but we're focusing at the time being
[1:22:17] just on the seat of discrepancy the
[1:22:20] bright side will come at its appointed
[1:22:22] time
[1:22:25] as they came about they had access to
[1:22:29] knowledge
[1:22:31] when you go if you have ever you take
[1:22:34] the time to travel from the East to the
[1:22:36] West you can see the progression of the
[1:22:38] nation
[1:22:40] the homes how they were built
[1:22:42] how small they were and the roads are
[1:22:46] small they are
[1:22:48] and as you come to the West the country
[1:22:52] gets bigger and bigger and perfect and
[1:22:55] more beautiful and more nicer
[1:22:59] why the access
[1:23:01] to romanism
[1:23:04] because when you look at for instance uh
[1:23:06] the capital as it was uh built I believe
[1:23:10] in 1800 if I'm not mistaken you see that
[1:23:13] prior to that
[1:23:15] they didn't have any
[1:23:17] they would meet uh just in a certain
[1:23:19] home or in a certain place and they
[1:23:22] would make all these debates and what
[1:23:25] kind of country do we want
[1:23:28] kind of uh voting system do we want
[1:23:32] we don't want her to have a system where
[1:23:35] people are and learn to just go and cast
[1:23:38] the vote without knowing what they're
[1:23:39] voting for
[1:23:41] because we don't want the power in the
[1:23:44] hands of just few mans as it was in
[1:23:47] Europe
[1:23:48] but without them knowing that they were
[1:23:50] just building the very image of that
[1:23:53] system they left
[1:23:55] because it was just the very same Spirit
[1:23:58] coming along
[1:24:00] and down the road after they have built
[1:24:03] all these things what did they turn that
[1:24:05] into turning now into the very system
[1:24:09] they left and start dominating and
[1:24:12] leading the entire world into sin
[1:24:15] why because the spirit behind it
[1:24:20] and now these Sons and Daughters of God
[1:24:22] who are now found into these systems
[1:24:26] the Lord also comes about to give them
[1:24:28] understanding
[1:24:30] to see like you know hey watch those
[1:24:33] systems how they started
[1:24:35] look at how they're going and watch how
[1:24:39] they're going to end up that's why they
[1:24:41] said like you know God raises communism
[1:24:44] not because as like you know many times
[1:24:47] you see on the news some of uh the
[1:24:51] Bishops who said like you know we're
[1:24:52] going to pray and we're going to fight
[1:24:54] communism as we just read it here you
[1:24:56] say like you know don't pay attention to
[1:24:58] that
[1:24:59] pay attention to that purple curtain
[1:25:03] watch to that system that comes at your
[1:25:06] doorsteps without you even realizing
[1:25:10] the system that gets into your home and
[1:25:13] telling you that you don't have your
[1:25:15] rights until to your children anymore
[1:25:17] that system that comes at your doorsteps
[1:25:20] and tells your girl that you can also be
[1:25:22] a man
[1:25:24] because they have access to knowledge
[1:25:27] and this knowledge made them understand
[1:25:29] how the human body is formed how they
[1:25:32] can retrieve a certain hormones and puts
[1:25:35] other owners to start changing their
[1:25:37] bodies
[1:25:38] you were born a man but at times you
[1:25:42] look at the person you can tell if it's
[1:25:44] a woman or a man down the road who would
[1:25:48] he that was a uncle Johnson now become
[1:25:51] sister I don't know
[1:25:55] and when you look at it it's funny but
[1:25:58] it is true
[1:26:01] and this is where Genesis 11 comes into
[1:26:04] play the Lord is saying like you know
[1:26:06] look at what how much access they have
[1:26:10] how much knowledge they have and by
[1:26:13] having access to that they're going to
[1:26:15] do exactly that let us build us a city
[1:26:20] the Forefront they say like you know
[1:26:22] what kind of country do we want we want
[1:26:24] where people can express the mind
[1:26:26] because back in Europe they were not
[1:26:29] given that opportunity
[1:26:32] therefore brother Nam says it is very
[1:26:35] important for us as Believers to have
[1:26:38] this knowledge not to start some Riot
[1:26:41] among us but to understand
[1:26:45] and to what are we called what kind of
[1:26:48] people are we supposed to be
[1:26:50] so we can look in ourselves they say
[1:26:53] like you know Lord these things here
[1:26:55] this I am better I am this I I am more
[1:26:58] knowledgeable I am all this year that's
[1:27:00] good to have knowledge but remember let
[1:27:04] not your knowledge let not your access
[1:27:07] to information
[1:27:09] turns you into the image of the Beast
[1:27:14] because by having access to knowledge
[1:27:17] look at what city the children of God
[1:27:20] have built
[1:27:21] they have access to know how to build
[1:27:23] the best building in the world very
[1:27:26] quickly as we see even in China has
[1:27:29] their building uh during coffee they
[1:27:31] were able to build probably like in six
[1:27:34] days of a big hospital that the world
[1:27:38] was so amazed why access to the very
[1:27:41] same system
[1:27:44] by having that access the man has
[1:27:47] improved themselves
[1:27:49] but also at the same time as the world
[1:27:52] is improving itself
[1:27:55] what should happen now to the Believers
[1:27:58] to stay with a revelation of 70 years
[1:28:01] ago no
[1:28:03] we have access to the world but the
[1:28:06] Revelation must get greater and greater
[1:28:08] as the day go by
[1:28:10] because as I said that you know you look
[1:28:13] at the East the houses were so small but
[1:28:16] as you move forward the house are bigger
[1:28:19] and they are built more faster than
[1:28:21] yesterday
[1:28:22] so having now access that also to the
[1:28:25] world should also Untitled us with all
[1:28:28] these ministers that have been around
[1:28:30] with all these experiences giving us
[1:28:33] tools to know how to be better
[1:28:35] Christians than yesterday
[1:28:39] by having now these principles with us
[1:28:41] then we are able not to understand what
[1:28:44] are we supposed to be that you can tell
[1:28:47] me anything no understand the principle
[1:28:52] Pastor you can show me tell me what to
[1:28:54] do no understand the principles
[1:28:57] because that the children of men have
[1:29:00] looked on to others who have went on
[1:29:02] before them to build a much better
[1:29:05] system than what was yesterday
[1:29:08] and now we are in the edge of AI with a
[1:29:12] artificial intelligence it's learning
[1:29:14] and making improvements over and over
[1:29:16] and over
[1:29:19] by making these improvements now they
[1:29:21] are able to tell you like oh imagine you
[1:29:24] live in a world where AI is able to
[1:29:28] detect your disease better than your
[1:29:31] doctor could be able in a million years
[1:29:34] with technology in six months AI was
[1:29:38] able to resolve questions that would
[1:29:40] have been resolved in a billion years
[1:29:45] in six months we had to wait a billion
[1:29:48] years to have the understanding but now
[1:29:51] ai by collecting all this information is
[1:29:55] able to treat it
[1:29:57] in six months then we know how the human
[1:30:00] brain should work how the DNA is made
[1:30:03] how this year why this year and now
[1:30:06] we're going into a stage of a personal
[1:30:09] capitalism
[1:30:12] this personal capitalism they want to
[1:30:14] know when do you sleep how many times
[1:30:16] did you wear that shirt when are you
[1:30:19] ready to buy a new shirt
[1:30:22] this is the system where it's getting
[1:30:25] better and better every day
[1:30:28] and you still have people who's just
[1:30:30] like you know although I'm me I I just
[1:30:33] read the message no you need more
[1:30:35] revelation
[1:30:37] you need to get deeper in the world and
[1:30:40] as you get deeper in the world it
[1:30:42] becomes more clearer and as the world
[1:30:44] comes on the pulpit is not just some
[1:30:46] basic elements but some higher standard
[1:30:49] element that when one word is said that
[1:30:52] everything is understood that could have
[1:30:54] been preached in five six seven sermons
[1:30:58] that's where we are called down to
[1:31:00] because when we have to speak because
[1:31:02] when you look at the children of Israel
[1:31:04] in the wilderness they're still there
[1:31:07] they heard God speaking
[1:31:10] I am the Lord thy God but from where
[1:31:13] they were they were only hearing
[1:31:15] Thunders
[1:31:17] God had a language a higher language
[1:31:21] but at where they were they couldn't
[1:31:23] hear it but God was able to show them
[1:31:26] that I could bring you to the stage
[1:31:28] where the Prophet was for you to be able
[1:31:31] to also hear and understand the language
[1:31:35] that's why in this hour now the
[1:31:38] Thunder's being revealed is not given
[1:31:41] unto us to remain in our former stage
[1:31:44] but instead not to get into a higher
[1:31:47] realm where we can understand and hear
[1:31:50] God's language
[1:31:52] because the Elijah standing there in the
[1:31:56] cave he said you know what am I doing
[1:31:58] here
[1:31:59] the voice says what are you doing here
[1:32:03] when you come here why are you here
[1:32:07] he said job good that loins I'll speak
[1:32:10] to you as a man where were you when I
[1:32:14] was laying the foundation of the world
[1:32:15] but job couldn't understand the language
[1:32:19] drug was not improved enough for him to
[1:32:22] understand who am I
[1:32:24] so there it is also with us today we are
[1:32:27] called unto the higher Revelations
[1:32:31] we were once up eaglets in the barnyard
[1:32:34] but we are not called just to remain
[1:32:36] English in the barnyard but we are
[1:32:39] called now to eat the fresh food the
[1:32:42] spiritual food induces them to get all
[1:32:45] the strength we need in order to fly up
[1:32:47] in the sky
[1:32:50] because this is the hour in which we are
[1:32:52] living in and now as now they were
[1:32:55] steady standing there the Bible says
[1:32:57] verse 5 and the Lord came down to see
[1:33:00] the city and the tower which the
[1:33:02] children of men built
[1:33:05] and as the Lord was coming down he came
[1:33:08] down there right there in Babylon
[1:33:13] the Lord came right there to see what
[1:33:16] they were doing
[1:33:18] just as the Lord came down in Genesis
[1:33:21] 19. he said like I came to see for
[1:33:24] myself what Sodom has done
[1:33:29] the Lord come all comes also down in
[1:33:32] this hour to see what also America and
[1:33:36] the rest of the world have built
[1:33:39] and now when the Lord comes now in your
[1:33:42] life what have you built
[1:33:45] when the Lord comes in our church what
[1:33:48] have we built
[1:33:50] are we like the disciples wanting to see
[1:33:53] Iraq in the church
[1:33:57] what are we building
[1:33:59] the Lord coming down in Babylon
[1:34:03] and as he comes down in Babylon he
[1:34:05] founds the age in a certain condition
[1:34:09] but he says that you know nevertheless I
[1:34:11] have my seeds also among them people
[1:34:15] and by God's grace to will be able like
[1:34:18] you know say God willing in the future
[1:34:20] now to start getting into there to see
[1:34:23] what does the Lord do what are these
[1:34:26] decisions and and on and on and on
[1:34:29] because like you know as I said the end
[1:34:31] times and the super race
[1:34:34] because that there's the seed of
[1:34:36] discrepancy there's also the child seed
[1:34:39] born from the pure word of God that
[1:34:42] brings now into maturity
[1:34:44] that's why I gave you the title the end
[1:34:47] times and the super race and as we go on
[1:34:51] it was important for us to break it down
[1:34:54] for us to understand what is happening
[1:34:57] in what world that we're living in what
[1:35:00] are we embracing what is the focus of
[1:35:03] our mind
[1:35:04] and by this year we see that the when
[1:35:07] the Lord comes down it does certain
[1:35:09] things it comes down it shows the
[1:35:11] prophet what is taking place in the land
[1:35:13] what are they doing what are they
[1:35:15] building and how is going to happen he
[1:35:17] says but the first two
[1:35:20] all these ISM or all these political
[1:35:24] systems will be swallowed up into the
[1:35:27] Third
[1:35:29] because when God comes down it comes
[1:35:31] with a specific message
[1:35:34] he said that my world I've created I've
[1:35:38] led to the devil do Roman do whatever
[1:35:41] you want to do all these years
[1:35:43] but very soon
[1:35:45] the kingdoms of the world becomes the
[1:35:48] kingdom of Our Lord
[1:35:52] this word is so precious
[1:35:55] from every angle that you look when you
[1:35:58] don't have God's program with you
[1:36:01] we just go to church
[1:36:04] we go make ourselves as much money as
[1:36:06] possible
[1:36:07] and by making as much money as possible
[1:36:10] without God's programming of Our Lives
[1:36:13] what do we turn unto the image of the
[1:36:16] Beast
[1:36:17] because remember there came a time where
[1:36:21] men could not sell
[1:36:23] could not do anything without the mark
[1:36:26] and this Mark is the rejection of the
[1:36:29] word by rejecting the word we take
[1:36:33] knowledge and it turns us into the image
[1:36:35] of the Beast
[1:36:38] and the choice is ours and that's what
[1:36:40] the Jesus now is also is keep showing
[1:36:43] the disciples that we can see that verse
[1:36:46] 25 25 so far has taken us almost three
[1:36:49] to four services
[1:36:52] in order for us to see what's going on
[1:36:55] and then he said then but ye shall not
[1:36:57] be so but he that is greatest among you
[1:37:00] let him be as the younger will get into
[1:37:04] what is as the younger for us to see
[1:37:07] what is to be young
[1:37:11] wonderful things that the Lord has for
[1:37:13] us in this world
[1:37:15] by God's grace
[1:37:19] time always runs out
[1:37:21] by God's grace but I believe this small
[1:37:24] thoughts to show
[1:37:26] these political systems
[1:37:29] how they came about
[1:37:31] what is the purpose behind
[1:37:34] it's not to make of us to give us a
[1:37:37] continuing City no
[1:37:41] but
[1:37:42] it's to shape a image unto the Beast
[1:37:48] let's not be fooled
[1:37:50] let the Lord to each one of us be able
[1:37:54] to reveal
[1:37:56] to us what is that in our lives
[1:38:00] because I just spoke it in a very high
[1:38:03] level
[1:38:05] speech
[1:38:07] but then
[1:38:09] how does these political systems affect
[1:38:12] our speech
[1:38:14] affect our perceptions
[1:38:17] what we say how it hurts people how you
[1:38:21] it's discriminatory and all these things
[1:38:24] here
[1:38:25] let God open that unto us
[1:38:28] and then from there we'll be able to see
[1:38:30] what will happen next shall we pray as
[1:38:34] the musician come
[1:38:35] Heavenly Father
[1:38:38] I'm so grateful Lord for their Grace and
[1:38:42] love as the word comes out in humility
[1:38:45] and simplicity
[1:38:47] when Lord we surrender unto you you
[1:38:51] always come about Lord
[1:38:53] to do your father got the job thank you
[1:38:56] Father once again
[1:38:57] as Lord we are looking away unto you for
[1:39:01] what comes up next
[1:39:03] may you love father God reveal that word
[1:39:06] let it mean Our Father God be knowledge
[1:39:08] just another sermon to us from the
[1:39:12] pulpit to the last row
[1:39:13] but instead Lord to go deeper into these
[1:39:17] things because time will fail afloat to
[1:39:20] break into every single part Lord may
[1:39:23] your grace and your love
[1:39:27] fill our hearts Lord
[1:39:30] without no father God and you with us
[1:39:33] Lord these things are just noises
[1:39:36] we all shag it off and and we'll carry
[1:39:40] on with what we continually do
[1:39:42] but then when we see what is taking
[1:39:44] place in the world we cannot truly see
[1:39:47] that today the scripture is fulfilled
[1:39:50] father
[1:39:51] because you have said it
[1:39:54] many years ago
[1:39:56] many couldn't see it
[1:39:58] many
[1:39:59] left it and passed and without even
[1:40:03] saying it but we're standing in this
[1:40:05] hour we're seeing all this revolution in
[1:40:08] the world
[1:40:09] may you love father God come to us and
[1:40:12] teach us more
[1:40:14] may you follow the prophet message for
[1:40:16] deliverance to each one of us
[1:40:19] heal us no father God
[1:40:22] in our bodies
[1:40:24] but most importantly
[1:40:27] our soul lord
[1:40:29] our theophanese
[1:40:31] may be aligned with you
[1:40:34] because by saying this Lord
[1:40:36] we know how to walk we know what to
[1:40:39] embrace Lord
[1:40:41] we look away unto you we ask and we pray
[1:40:44] all the things and with Thanksgiving in
[1:40:47] Jesus Christ's name
[1:40:49] amen
