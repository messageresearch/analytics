And when I meet old Satan to him, I always say I am determined to hold out to the end. And Jesus is with me on my hand. And I know I have salvation for I feel it in my soul. So hold on to the end. And Satan was so angry and said he'd send me back. Just let the path go narrow and he will lose the track. And I'm so full of glory. My Lord, I always find and I just say to Satan, old man can me because I am determined to the end. Oh Jesus, I can't know I have salvation for I feel it in my soul.

I am determined. Last earth. And when I hear the trumpet oh sounding in the sky and see mountain trembling to heaven I will fly. For Jesus will be calling. There'll be no time to fear. With joy I'll go up singing. I held out. Amen. I am determined about the end. Jesus is with me. On him I can't. And I know I know I feel it in my soul. I am determined to hold out to the end.

I Father, I thank you and I praise you and I love you this morning. &gt;&gt; I pray that you will anoint your speaker and the hearers and may the Holy Spirit have preeminence in this service.

I was going to sing bring them in, bring them in, but that's for a different different blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly enjoyed that song special this morning. &gt;&gt; Wow. That that's some revelation behind that song. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just uh in this world temporarily. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world." &gt;&gt; Hey, buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I think everybody wants to be able to see you guys. We're going to have you just line up right here. Right here. Yeah. Yeah. We'll get the cameras on you guys. Yeah. Look at Hey, look at them smiling real big and everything, huh? Well, brother Matt and and sister Jackie have been praying about some things. And let me see here. Let's get a microphone here. And let's go ahead and we'll let uh brother Matthew, go ahead and tell us a little bit about what has uh brought about this decision and what you're going to do. And and uh we love you guys. You have been such a special family to us. &gt;&gt; Lowmaintenance sheep. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, every pastor loves low maintenance and everything, but we know that you've suffered through some things and endured and everything, and we know that the will of God will never take you where the grace of God can keep you. Tell us a little bit about your decision, please. &gt;&gt; So, uh, well, Jackie's had some health issues for a while and, uh, doesn't like living in the city, and that's never been a secret for any of us. You know, she was grew up in the country in Montana. um just poured her heart out to me for the last couple years about wanting to move. And um I was like, "No, we have church, we have work, we have a good interest rate on the house." Like, we weren't going anywhere, right? And so, uh uh she finally just went to the Lord and prayed and said, "Lord, you have to speak to him." And uh or to me, to both of us. And uh yeah, she he could have said no. So, uh, not without going too long, but, um, uh, we we got that leaning. We we got a word from him and, uh, so we just kind of leaned that way and knocked on a door and and the first door was our business to go and so we put that up for sale thinking I was thinking months. This thing ain't going to sell. Two weeks to the day it sold. And so that I I became unemployed at that point. And so, uh, it was really a confirmation of God wanting to do this. in and why Ohio. It's a different bit of a climate. We know uh Brother Chad's church out there. Brother Ron has good things to say about him. And so we're really moving for um for the word really is what it is. And it wasn't because there's anything wrong here. It's just because there there was this desire on her heart to move. And so if we're going to move, we've got to go to church somewhere. And where do we go? And so that that was the biggest thing in in in our decision process. So here we are. Um, we've got they've got one more Sunday here and then uh they'll be flying out and my oldest son Gideon and I will be mid August before we leave. So, um, that's kind of &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Give him a hand. &gt;&gt; Well, you have been a very, very special family, a special blessing to us and Don't, &gt;&gt; but you go with our blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a little bittersweet &gt;&gt; how that we love you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you too. &gt;&gt; But uh I've ever had &gt;&gt; Yeah.

We love you guys. You've been very, very special to us. &gt;&gt; And so, you go with our blessings. And I think that any pastor when he loses or loans the sheep out to another shepherd.

Watch over them. Keep them, Father, in the center of thy perfect will. I pray, oh God, that they will uh find joy, peace, ha, happiness, health, all the things that they're desiring.

Um up there it's his anniversary. He's pastor of the church up there and uh so uh Kate Rose, our granddaughter is going to go with us. So we're looking forward to that and everything. God bless you all this morning. Let's stand together. I'd like you to turn with me in your Bibles if you would please to the book of Joel, chapter 2. We'll go to Joel 2. Then we'll go to Joel 3. And then we'll go to numbers. Joel chapter 2 vers 15- 16. Blow the trumpet in Zion. Sanctify a fast and call a solemn assembly. Gather the people, sanctify the congregation. Assemble the elders and gather the children and those that suck the breasts. Let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet. Notice that this trumpet is signifying. &gt;&gt; It's fast. It's calling an assembly. &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that this calling of the assembly is extremely unique because now we see the that the bridegroom is coming forth &gt;&gt; and that the bride is coming out of her closet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an awakening time. It's a positioning time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me. Joel 3 verses 9-14. Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles. Prepare war. Wake up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near. Let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords. and your pruning hooks into spears. &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, I am strong. &gt;&gt; Assemble yourselves and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about. Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord. Amen. Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, get you down, for the press is full, and the fats overflow, for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valleys of decision. &gt;&gt; For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. &gt;&gt; The sun and the moon shall be dark and the stars shall withdraw their shining. The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake, and the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to notice there in verse 9, proclaim ye this among the Gentiles. Prepare war, and wake up the mighty men. Turn with me to the book of Numbers. Let's go back in your Old Testament here. The book of Numbers, chapter 10. Numbers chapter 10. I first want you to notice, I did not give it to the brethren, but you have your Bibles open. If you notice uh verse two, make the two trumpets of silver of whole peace thou shalt make them thou shalt that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps. Two trumpets made the same way. One is for the calling of the assembly and the other is the journeying of the camps. So we believe that we have heard a trumpet in this hour &gt;&gt; and it's gathered us together for a solemn assembly &gt;&gt; and we're waiting now for the final truck &gt;&gt; which will be the journey &gt;&gt; of the camp. &gt;&gt; Are we together now? &gt;&gt; So we see it in scripture. Turn with me. Here it is in verse n. And if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets, and you shall be remembered before the Lord your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord. Now I would like to take a title this morning that the seventh angel has blasted forth his gospel trumpet. I want all of you to be acutely aware that it is that trumpet that you have heard. This message that you are completely aware of has affected you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; That's why we have been called out of denomination. &gt;&gt; And into the glorious light that God has sent in this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I would like to take a subject this morning. The shout has gathered the mighty men to prepare war. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as I've been studying and seeking the mind of the Lord on this, uh, I've been looking through the scriptures all the way from Genesis to Revelation. And we see that there's all kinds of wars. We see Israel was troubled with wars not only within Israel itself within their own camp but we certainly see the enemies round about them. &gt;&gt; We see that when they went into the promised land that they had to fight for the land. &gt;&gt; It was a battle. Brother Bram said you're going to have to fight &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. for the land that you possess. &gt;&gt; You are not called to a picnic. You are called to a battle. &gt;&gt; Now, as I begin to go through this and I I gave Thank you, brother Robert. As I gave some of uh these scriptures and I I told the brothers I would refer to this in the book of Revelation. If you all want to just make a note of this or turn back real quickly in your Bibles to the book of Revelation, we're going to find out that there is continual verbiage of war. &gt;&gt; I want you to see this in Revelations 11 and 7. The Bible says, "And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them." &gt;&gt; I want you to understand there is war happening around us and we must be aware of spiritual warfare. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelations 12 and 17. And the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. Again we see make war. &gt;&gt; Revelations 13 and verse 4. And they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast. And they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like unto the beast? And who is able to make war with him?" Revelations 13 and 7. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations. Revelation 17 and 14. These shall make war with the lamb. &gt;&gt; We're talking about warfare. &gt;&gt; And these shall make war with the lamb, and the lamb shall overcome them, for he is lord of lords and king of kings, &gt;&gt; and they that are with him are called the chosen and faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 and 11. And it says, "And I saw heaven open, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in righteousness, he doth judge and make war. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 and 19. And I saw the beasts and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army. So I want you to see that even the book of Revelation, we know that the Bible speaks of wars and of rumors of wars. We see that we're in the time right now where Matthew 24 is being filled around us. We see all kinds of wars and distress among nations. We even see a civil war happening right here in the United States. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Our country is fracturing. &gt;&gt; It is falling apart. &gt;&gt; And a a company that is not together if it's divided will sure surely fall. Sir, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "There's coming a time judgment's going to strike America." &gt;&gt; I believe that the reason we have not seen the judgment strike America like it will is because the bride is still here. &gt;&gt; And he said she is represented by a thin film of of blood that covers the earth. &gt;&gt; And it says, "And so the judgments of God cannot penetrate through that." Okay? Because there is representation of blood. But once that blood is taken, &gt;&gt; then let me tell you, death and hell will come upon the earth, there will be tribulation as never seen upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, if there's ever a time that we need to be serious with God, let us be serious with God now. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm going to take a different approach to the u this uh speaking about war and about the opening of the seven seals. I want you. So when I take this viewpoint, I want you to actually understand that every time a seal was broken, there was an exposing of Satan and his plan. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; So may I say this so that you will understand the opening of the seals is actually the complete exposure. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of Satan, his plans. &gt;&gt; What he started from the beginning until his very end. There's two books in the Bible Satan hates the most. &gt;&gt; He hates Genesis because it shows where he came from. It shows where he started. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And he hates Revelation because it shows where he's going. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if the devil ever tells you and and and condemns you of your past, remind him of his future. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So right now around the world there are many message believers that are talking about the open book the opening of the seals talking about Revelations 10 1-7 then going into Revelations 10:8 where John was commanded John being a type of the bride &gt;&gt; to take the book and to eat did. &gt;&gt; And so we find out that this opening of the seven seals is a complete exposure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Of Satan and his master plan. &gt;&gt; He wants to ascend himself above the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He wants to be called the most high. &gt;&gt; And he's doing everything he can to deceive the people on the earth. And the brother Brennham said, "The reason the bride cannot be deceived is because the bride's absolute is the scripture." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, some have told me, brother Ron, our message is the absolute. &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you, the Bible is God's thumbum. &gt;&gt; But the reason that we put such emphasis on on this end time message was because his absolute. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; His absolute was the word of God. &gt;&gt; Because a prophet can never add to, take away. &gt;&gt; But he will reveal those things, the mystery truths &gt;&gt; that God has hid down through the ages. But now is being revealed. &gt;&gt; And what what excites all of us now &gt;&gt; is we're a part of that mystery. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Each one of you &gt;&gt; have been affected. &gt;&gt; If you haven't been as yet, you should be &gt;&gt; to understand that this message &gt;&gt; and the supernatural things, angels, visions, prophecies are all coming to pass right now before our wondering eyes. My, what an hour to be living in. &gt;&gt; This is the crescendo. &gt;&gt; This is the climax. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; And yes, I very much rejoice about the opening of the book, the mysteries being revealed. And we can see that a lot of times people want to jump and shout and dance about because of what has happened. But I want to play another portion of this and make you acutely aware. &gt;&gt; We're in a battle. &gt;&gt; And the reason that each seal was opened, it declared a war. So understand that &gt;&gt; that this is spiritual war &gt;&gt; and all of you have got to be prepared for it. &gt;&gt; Even Joshua was told by the Lord teach your children war. &gt;&gt; He says for those that came out of Egypt knew what it was like to have had wars and had task masters. But those that were raised in the message on the journey did not know why. &gt;&gt; In fact, many of them had not even been circumcised. And Joshua was told by God, "Go and take Israel and circumcise them again." And he says, "How can I do it? If they've been circumcised, how can you do it again?" He said, "The children of the wilderness." Now listen to this. The children of the wilderness are a type of those that have been raised in this message, &gt;&gt; not knowing the fightings and disputings that we had with denominations which were spirits. &gt;&gt; Are you aware? Spirits. &gt;&gt; That's why this voice in this age said, "Come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; Be ye separate, saith God. &gt;&gt; Lest you be partakers of her place." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So this prophet's ministry became so supernatural that it caused quite a stir among denominations and they all invited him. They tried to figure him out. Are you oneist? Are you trinitarian? Are you Baptist, Pentecostal? He said, "Well, I'm Baptist as long as you stay with the word. I'm Pentecostal." He goes on and on. Well, I'm actually Baptist, Pentecostal, Lutheran, Methodist. See, because what he was doing is saying, "Hey, look, don't put me into a certain &gt;&gt; way." &gt;&gt; Because everybody tries to, you know, figure something out. And what are you? Where did you come from? Where did you get this message? Let me explain to you that this message was not William Brennham. &gt;&gt; He said, "Against my own better judgment, I wanted to go and be a trapper. But God kept him. Wouldn't even allow him to commit suicide when he was so distraught &gt;&gt; at the death of his wife and his baby. &gt;&gt; He went through but he could not do it. &gt;&gt; Why? God was keeping him. Why? He wasn't done with his ministry. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because of you and I. &gt;&gt; God so loved you. wouldn't allow him to do what he wanted to do. He says, "Hope, I'm gonna see you in just a moment." Took his glove off. You all know wanted to grab that highline. &gt;&gt; I'll see you in just a moment. His heart is breaking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sharon Rose, daddy's going to see you in just a moment. He looked down and he saw an imagery of him on the power pole, his arms stretched out, and he said, "There's Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Oh, God, forgive me. I can't take it anymore." &gt;&gt; Took his glove off and he found himself at the foot of the pole. &gt;&gt; I want you to know that God supernaturally &gt;&gt; wouldn't let him &gt;&gt; do that because of you. &gt;&gt; Because you had not been called out yet. He had not opened the seals. He had not finished his ministry. There was no vindication of his ministry as yet. The third pole had to come. &gt;&gt; The vision must be fulfilled. And we're a part of that vision, are we not? &gt;&gt; Behold, I sent unto you, Elijah. &gt;&gt; How many of you take that personal? He sent it to me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, they began to tell the prophet, just come to the meeting, work your gift, but don't preach because Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're you're ignorant and unlearned. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they didn't want him to preach. See, they No one was offended. I want all of you to understand, no one was ever offended by the miracles, by the signs and wonders. No one was offended by healing except for the Sadducees, healing on a Sabbath day or something like that. They always wanted to find fault with Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; But they were these signs and wonders, whether it's water to wine, whether it's fishes and loaves, &gt;&gt; it was an attraction, was it not? &gt;&gt; No man can do these things except that God be with him. &gt;&gt; And so we see that he's changing his ministry. And when he changes his ministry, it becomes offensive. And now the multitudes had followed him. It says that many said, "This is a hard saying. Who can hear it?" &gt;&gt; And they walked no more with him. &gt;&gt; St. John 666. &gt;&gt; And so we see that when Christ changed his ministry that it was an offense. And I want you to understand that the prophet of God when he changes his ministry, it became an offense to denominational spirits and they closing the doors everywhere. &gt;&gt; 1956, brother Brennham has God give him a vision and tells him about first, second, and third pole. Talks him to him about a tent. talks to him about fishing, talks to him about a little room. I'll meet you in there. And so, Brother Brandham, remember now, brother Brennham is given all kinds of symbols. That's why people look for a physical &gt;&gt; happening. They look for a physical. Well, listen. If the vision itself is physical, all of it will be physical. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? I want to ask you, when did brother Brennham try to lace that baby shoe with a rope? &gt;&gt; Never happened. What was it? A symbol. &gt;&gt; What about that little room? &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam said, "Well, I'll meet you in there." &gt;&gt; And then Brother Brandham asked the angel, "What do you mean that little room? Why in there? Why there?" He said, "Because is it not written in the scripture?" See, going back to scripture, &gt;&gt; to enter into thy closet. I want to ask you, where was Elijah's prayer closet, &gt;&gt; wilderness, &gt;&gt; a cave, a mountaintop? &gt;&gt; He's getting away from people influences. &gt;&gt; Huh? I tell you, if you ever want to get a hold of God, get away from people. Get alone. Get somewhere where you can fast and pray and seek the mind of God and be away from all kinds of influences. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So we see there and let me just bring this to you as a warning that when the opening of the seals happened, it was an exposure that Satan hated. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so it declared a war, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so now, Brother Brennan was saying, and I I I want to lead into this, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to show you in the scriptures, but I have a hard time because there's so much that I want to say. All right. &gt;&gt; When a sword is drawn from its sheath in scripture, it is a declaration of war. Ezekiel 21:es 1-5. Here we go. And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, and say unto the land of Israel, thus saith the Lord, behold, I am against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of the sheath. Notice this. What's he doing? Declaring war. Whenever a sword appears and it's drawn, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; I will cut off from thee the righteousness and the wicked, seeing then that I will cut them off off from thee the righteous and the wicked. Therefore shall my sword go forth out of the sheath against all flesh from the south and to the north that all flesh may know that I am the Lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath. &gt;&gt; It shall not return anymore. What God is doing in this age, what do you think the prophet is doing in Sabino Canyon? &gt;&gt; He's up there. What happens? A sword is unchath. It strikes his hand. &gt;&gt; He said, "I thought it's a sword." He said, "It's not a sword. &gt;&gt; It's the king's sword." He said, "This is that third pull." &gt;&gt; This is what you've been praying about. I'm showing you. This will be the vindication of your ministry. What God's doing. &gt;&gt; Come on. Put your spiritual thinking cap on. He's unchath the sword. He's declared war. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I trust you see it friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the attraction on the mountain 65? I went up in the canyon, climbed plum up where the eagles was flying around. I was watching some deer standing there. I knelt down to pray, raised up my hands, and a sword struck my hand. I looked around. I thought, "What's that? I'm not beside myself. Here's that sword in my hand, bright, shiny, glistening in the sun. I said, 'Now, there's not people in miles of me way up here in the canyon. Where could that come from? I heard a voice said, "That's the king's sword." &gt;&gt; I said, "A king knights a man with a sword." Now, watch his thought. &gt;&gt; I want you to know he's actually kned. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this sword. God is knighting this messenger with a word. I dub thee. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 and seven. &gt;&gt; I dub thee a messenger. You are to take the king's message to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the voice came back, &gt;&gt; not a king's sword, &gt;&gt; the king's sword. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord &gt;&gt; said, "Fear not. It's only the third pull. It's the vindication of your ministry." &gt;&gt; Now, I want you all of you to understand that prophets are given visions and visions are symbols. The book of Revelation is a book of symbols. &gt;&gt; It's white horse rider and a black horse rider and so on and so forth and and trumpets and seven golden candlesticks and on and on. Those are all symbols that represent something. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I don't want you to get your mind uh let's say your hard drive locked up on thinking about something physical. &gt;&gt; I want you because God is his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; God can interpret his word or the vision that he gives &gt;&gt; himself &gt;&gt; by bringing it to pass &gt;&gt; and it may be totally different than what you thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, a lot of times what we do is we get preconceived ideas because somebody's taught you, well, he's got to do this and therefore this means that and over here and therefore we got to go and we got to look for a physical tent. &gt;&gt; Well, why don't you take the overall picture and see that he's talking about a change in ministry. &gt;&gt; Not about a physical 10. It's about a change in ministry. I'll meet you in there. You're good at this and that. No, don't you know little fish and bigger fish and you all know the visions, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So only the sword of the spirit can divide between the soul and the spirit. &gt;&gt; Theology can't do it. &gt;&gt; Seminary education cannot do it. and religious teaching cannot do it. &gt;&gt; It will take someone who has supernatural ability &gt;&gt; able to receive supernatural instruction. &gt;&gt; In fact, brother Brennham said, "These people, I will call them the initiated." &gt;&gt; They're brought into something. Why? Why did that song that you sing up here, let it be on be more than just a song. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I came from another kingdom. &gt;&gt; I'm going back to that kingdom. &gt;&gt; I'm on a journey right now. I haven't completed my journey. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I'm going home. &gt;&gt; Why? Because my father is drawing me. &gt;&gt; I cannot be stopped. Why? It's his doing. &gt;&gt; It's his watching over his own promise. &gt;&gt; He's watching over his seed. &gt;&gt; God's always watched over his seat. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 33:es 1-7. Again, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, when I bring the sword upon the land, if the people of the land take a man of their coast, and set him for their watchmen, how many of you have heard the sermon, watchmen, what of the night? &gt;&gt; He said, what is it God ordained men that he's placed on the wall? &gt;&gt; Watchmen, &gt;&gt; what of the night? Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blows the trumpet and warns the people. Notice the watchman catches something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning, if the sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning. That's right. &gt;&gt; His blood shall be upon him, but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; This message is a warning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the message of the hour. If the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned. If the sword come and take away any person from among them he has taken away in his iniquity his blood will I require it the watchman's hand. &gt;&gt; So thou son of man I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel. Therefore, thou shalt hear the word at thy mouth and warn them from me. I want all of you, oh house of Israel, &gt;&gt; spiritual seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; I want you to know that there's been a watchman that has been sent in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's preaching a message. He's blowing forth a gospel trumpet. &gt;&gt; It is a warning. It's urgent. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's declaring something's happening. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This message, may I say it, is God blowing a gospel trumpet &gt;&gt; in this hour. this messenger when he begins to declare his me not when he starts &gt;&gt; but when he begins to enter into his ministry &gt;&gt; he said I've mixed this if world evangelism and &gt;&gt; prophetic gift said what good has it done &gt;&gt; yeah come on &gt;&gt; he says now I I want to go into the center of God's perfect will &gt;&gt; you you realize that prophets when they enter into the perfect will of God that there is an urgency. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; About their message. Now they come out and they have thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's no more speculation. Well, I think it means this. &gt;&gt; It could mean that. No, they come out. It's thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. This message was circumcised with the opening of the seven seals. &gt;&gt; It was a sign given. It cut away Clarence Larkin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; His love's two Babylons. &gt;&gt; The pre- niasian fathers. &gt;&gt; It cut away all of the knowledge of man. Because brother Bram said, "You all know I preached the seals before." He said I was a 100 miles from the truth. &gt;&gt; But now God, every time an angel came, &gt;&gt; each one when the first angel came, he came and broke to him the opening of that first seal. And what did he do? He said, "Oh my, it's not Christ. It's the Antichrist. &gt;&gt; It's an exposing of Satan. &gt;&gt; Trying to come into the church, trying to conquer. Why? He's nickelan and he wants to divide and conquer. Let me say this. We are not divided. We have been united together with Christ and his word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? It's a uniting time &gt;&gt; and seed sign. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding? This message is not rules. &gt;&gt; It is not dressing. &gt;&gt; It is not church order. It's Christ. He is those seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Good preaching, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You go to answer and back like that, let me tell you, you'll get me to preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, brother. Preaching. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; This message I want you to understand is God blowing his gospel trumpet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham, even on one tape he said, "This is no longer the voice &gt;&gt; of William Brandham. It's a voice of almighty God." &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; he was just an instrument. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Romans 13:4. He is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do not which, excuse me, but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid, sir. &gt;&gt; For he beareth not the sword in vain, for he is the minister of God, &gt;&gt; a revenger to execute wrath &gt;&gt; upon them that doeth evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brennham, now I want you to understand that the word of God is a sharp two-edged sword dividing. There's there's nothing that between the spirit and delicately took the word of the Lord said you could be anointed with the on your spirit be the Holy Spirit your spirit and he said in your soul. &gt;&gt; Watch the level of anointing. &gt;&gt; He said in your soul on its way to hell. &gt;&gt; So he began to divide us. Oh, you spoke in tongues. You dance in the spirit. You prophesied. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean you got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; not on the soul. You got it on your spirit &gt;&gt; because it is the activating the gifts of the spirit. Got nothing to do with the soul. But he says to show you when you've got it on the inside in the soul room, the control room. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your control room is controlled by Christ the word himself. &gt;&gt; It's no longer &gt;&gt; creeds and dogmas. &gt;&gt; He's in control. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can pray for the sick, cast out devils. You can do all those things. I want to ask you, the disciples were with Christ for three, three and a half years, been picked up, fishermen on the come follow me. He told them, I don't want you to rejoice that demons are cast out and you have control over them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Rejoice that your names are written in this book of life." &gt;&gt; There's the difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here they were preaching, praying for the sick, signs and wonders following. And he said, "Peter, when you get converted, &gt;&gt; so all of those things, okay, &gt;&gt; had nothing to do with their soul being baptized." &gt;&gt; So now I'm I'm I'm I'm going to take my time this morning by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 4:12, the Bible says, "For the word of God is quick, &gt;&gt; and it's powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Piercing even to the dividing of sunder &gt;&gt; of the soul and the spirit. Watch. Watch that word from that prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You could have it on your spirit. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And you're It never touched your soul. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Because I can tell by the fruits. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can look at what you're feeding upon and I can see that your souls never had the control room &gt;&gt; taken over by the master. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the joints and the marrow. So now it's the flesh and blood &gt;&gt; between the joints and the marrow. You can have the anointing on the outer court. Y &gt;&gt; you can have it on the inner court. &gt;&gt; You can speak in tongues. &gt;&gt; You can prophesy. &gt;&gt; You can do all kinds of things because the spirit activating you. &gt;&gt; But there's only one thing that'll change you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not anoint you, not conform you, transform you. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Eight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A transformation, a metamorphosis. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; From earthly to heavenly. &gt;&gt; Be not conformed, but be transformed. Metamorpho &gt;&gt; to be changed. Hallelujah. All of you. I want you to understand you that have had the word of God that's come to you. &gt;&gt; It's changed you, &gt;&gt; but it hasn't climaxed yet. Come on. &gt;&gt; It will shortly &gt;&gt; moment &gt;&gt; because in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, we shall all be &gt;&gt; changed. &gt;&gt; This mortal will put on immortality. &gt;&gt; The only part of you that has already put on immortality is the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; The control tower. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So now understand that it took the word of God to come and it's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why ministry of the word is a live ministry. I want you to understand when why do you come to church? Why do you gather together? &gt;&gt; Because if you will be under the right anointing, &gt;&gt; if you'll be praying, if you'll be doing things, then God &gt;&gt; can anoint the minister to say something and he doesn't even know why he said it, but it was God answering your prayer because you were pulling something down &gt;&gt; from heaven and God was answering your prayer. Yes, sir. And you ought to say, "Thank you, God. You did it for me. I know why you said it. I know why you did it. That was for me, and I take it. It was mine. It was you given me my inheritance." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's why no minister takes any glory unto himself. &gt;&gt; If you have ever been helped, if you've ever been given a word, it wasn't because of me. It was because of him. &gt;&gt; It was because of your promise &gt;&gt; that God gave you. He said, "I'll be with you &gt;&gt; even in you till the end of the world." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why this prophet could discern. He says, "And people say I'm I'm against women. They call me a woman hater &gt;&gt; because I tell them immoral clothes is wrong. &gt;&gt; I tell them cutting your hair, it's wrong. &gt;&gt; Takes them back to the word. &gt;&gt; He says if you had the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; he said it has to reverberate back. &gt;&gt; It has to resonate back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the Holy Ghost which rode the word &gt;&gt; must say amen to it. &gt;&gt; That's why he says they call I don't hate women. He says I hate the wrong kind &gt;&gt; of woman. He says they say I'm against people. I'm not against people. He says I love people. I'm against the system. &gt;&gt; Well, but I go to church. My pastor told me and I'm up there and I sing in the choir and I have gifts operating and I do this and I do that. And he says, "No doubt." But it was this message &gt;&gt; that began to divide in Joe. &gt;&gt; That man that came now please understand this saints. That man, a minister, a prominent minister brought his wife to meet the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "She's a saint." He said, "Oh my, I had such an expectation." He says, "And when she came before me with her dress and her fingernails and so on, I'm not going to go into it." And he says, "Oh my, it looks more like a hint." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Than a saint, do you think that he's just being critical? &gt;&gt; What it is is he's showing No, no, no. Cuz now this man being denomination, his wife is reflecting Mystery Babylon. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Mystery Babylon. So this man can vocalize. Oh, my wife is a saint. I look at her, it's contrary to the word. Can't be. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; It cannot be. Now we are fighting now. And I want all of you to understand that we are in the midst of spiritual warfare. And you need to know about spiritual warfare less you become the casualty in Laiusa. &gt;&gt; The government has turned against God. In fact, brother Bram said all governments of the world. Don't just think America. &gt;&gt; All governments of the world are controlled by the devil. And he said, he said, "If the devil can't get you and destroy your family, he'll use the government against you." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Let me show you the hardest trial that prophet of God went until the pressure was put on him so great, he lied. Told his wife to lie, &gt;&gt; tell him I'm not in." &gt;&gt; Stepped outside. What was the pressure from? &gt;&gt; IRS. &gt;&gt; IRS. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the government will come after you. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Because when Daniel, &gt;&gt; Daniel, when they said, "Well, there's a decree. The king has made a decree." &gt;&gt; Do you think that stopped Daniel? &gt;&gt; Open the windows &gt;&gt; three times a day. He wasn't ashamed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? Let me tell you, my brother, my sister, they asked that that war admiral one day in a ship battle. They said, "Have you do you want to call a truce? Do you want to give up?" He said, "John Paul Jones, &gt;&gt; we've just begun to fight." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A sword is for close quarters. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is not guns and rockets and atomic bombs. &gt;&gt; This is the sword that means it's close quarters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Could come from your family. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I didn't come to bring peace." but a &gt;&gt; if you love your father, mother, sister, brother more than me, you're not worthy of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you have to cut something loose. &gt;&gt; If your hand offends you, cut it off. If your eye offends you, pluck it out. Spiritual amputation. There are times, this is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are times within your own family &gt;&gt; that if your kids are not going to go, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go on whether you like it or not. I'm going to go and serve God. I believe you'll change, but I'm not here to &gt;&gt; p &gt;&gt; pet and pamper you. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to give you some false hope. Well, I'm applying the token over you. Yeah. Well, unless you get under the token, you're not under it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the truth, brother. &gt;&gt; The two messengers that Rahab hid in her house, they said, "Okay." Because she said, "Give me a token. &gt;&gt; I'll give you a scarlet thread." &gt;&gt; And said, "But you know what? Unless your kids are under that same token or your family, &gt;&gt; we're not responsible for what happens outside. &gt;&gt; Understand that you young people don't don't sit there and let you have some devil tells you. Well, mom and dad have said they applied the token. Even though I live contrary to the word, even though I don't do, even though now, hey, let me tell you, you ain't going. &gt;&gt; You got to come yourself. It ain't because of your daddy. It ain't because you're a mama. It ain't because of the prophet. It's because you got a relationship born again. You've been filled with the Holy Ghost. You've been sealed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Government come against you. Church has rejected and put Christ out. Brother Renham said, "Behold, he stands at the door and knocks." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "This is the first stage." He said, "Where Christ himself is not welcome in his own church." &gt;&gt; Put outside. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said the family unit has been broken up. &gt;&gt; He says family's become dysfunctional. Daddy's not taking his position, so mama's not taking hers. And the heart of the family is the husband and wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you all of you to understand. So you guys got got married. Thank you. Praise God. You got the ring put on your finger. Go live happily ever after. No quarrels, no arguments, no fights, no nothing. You're going to live in Nirvana the rest of your life. Are you kidding me? That's a fairy tale. &gt;&gt; That's right. You know that to be the truth. &gt;&gt; Just ask your parents. &gt;&gt; Listen to their disputations. Brother Brim said, "Wouldn't you have liked to been a little fly on the wall of the tent in Abraham &gt;&gt; and Sarah &gt;&gt; or Moses &gt;&gt; and Zapora? I thank God for a wife. &gt;&gt; I do. She's my helpmate. &gt;&gt; She is my help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But nobody can press my button like she can either. Don't come against me. I'm the head of this house. Yeah. You know what she does? Oh, come here. Let me feed you. Don't touch me. &gt;&gt; No, I tell you. Hey, listen. We all have our issues. &gt;&gt; Greg Alfred one time he told me he's from New Zealand. He said, "I and my wife have never had an argument." Oh, we've had some times of disputation and intense fellowship. That's why listen you you young people &gt;&gt; realize that when marriage it's a combining of two natures &gt;&gt; and and it's different. &gt;&gt; You think different. &gt;&gt; You act different. And if if you come from different cultures, &gt;&gt; that's even worse. Okay. And so you try now you put the ring on the finger and live happily ever after. It don't happen. The reality is they say actually the honeymoon is over in about 3 years and then the reality of life sets in and it happens. I want you to understand that the devil tried to get to the first couple. &gt;&gt; He's going to try to do the same thing. &gt;&gt; He started with Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; He ends with the second Adam. &gt;&gt; And the second Eve, &gt;&gt; but he can't get between the two of them &gt;&gt; because they're one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They've been united together again. And he's her protector. &gt;&gt; Why? She's laid herself like Ruth at the feet of Boaz. &gt;&gt; Cover me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cover me when I am lonely. &gt;&gt; Cover me when I'm not strong. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. cover me. &gt;&gt; Now in the sermon the junction of time. Now brother Brenham listen to sermon titles &gt;&gt; because there it's a declaration junction of time. So now he says and Jesus Christ when he was here on earth says as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man. Right? &gt;&gt; We have the highest rate of divorce than the whole than the whole world put together. We have more divorces. And may I say this? Do you know divorces are becoming even acceptable now among the message? &gt;&gt; God is not for &gt;&gt; divorce. &gt;&gt; But it happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? We just come down here and we're human. We're people. We make people mistakes and we do things wrong. One thing I love about about Brother Brenam, now I'm going to say this. He says, "If you got the wrong one here, you'll get the right one over there." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll make all wrongs right. Do &gt;&gt; you understand that? &gt;&gt; Amen. So for every Adam &gt;&gt; there is an equal Eve &gt;&gt; she will be born of his bone &gt;&gt; and flesh of his flesh &gt;&gt; okay it will not be mixed &gt;&gt; she will look like him &gt;&gt; excuse me now he says we have the highest rate of divorce men the Bible Ible said would be marrying and giving in marriage, eating, drinking, the morals and so forth that they have. How that they marrying and giving in marriage in Reno, Nevada is men go out and live with her, marry a girl, take her for a wife, live with her for a few days. You don't like her, kick her out. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Is that what you want to teach your kids? kick her off without the courts. Ungodly people, give them a divorce and a license to marrying another. God says that's wrong. That's right. &gt;&gt; Our civilization is crumbling. &gt;&gt; We see that it's a sign, a post that we're at the end time. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Bren is saying, "Now, watch this. All of this, &gt;&gt; the marrying and giving a marriage and the divorce and living together, it's a sign. It's a junction &gt;&gt; in time. And he says, "We've come to that junction. I'm here declaring to you it's a sign we're here." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Watch." He says, "God does supernatural things at junctions." &gt;&gt; This is the age of people's rights. Why? It's loud. &gt;&gt; My body, my right. I can do what I want. From abortionists to pornographers, &gt;&gt; from homosexuals to drug users and pedophiles, &gt;&gt; they all say, "I have the right to do what I want." &gt;&gt; Because this is the age of people's rights. &gt;&gt; The church is only as strong as the home unit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. That's why God give us strong families, &gt;&gt; husbands in your position, wives in your position. Because when the husband's in position, the wife's in position, &gt;&gt; the children will be in position, &gt;&gt; and God's pleased, &gt;&gt; does that mean you're with without trouble? &gt;&gt; Hey, wake up, man. &gt;&gt; You're in warfare. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can do all of the above things that are right and correct &gt;&gt; and still have all kinds of hell breaking loose all around you. &gt;&gt; It's a battle. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; And if you're not in a battle right now, you're coming out of one. &gt;&gt; But guess what? There's another one around the corner. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; So, we need to be spiritually aware. So, with the opening of the seals and praise God with with all of this and we take the book and we eat it and hallelujah and praise God and we're the final voice. Yes. Hallelujah. Praise God. I agree. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you better prepare for war. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the devil hates this me. That's why &gt;&gt; he hates this message. Denominations hate the revealing of the word. Why? It exposes. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; It exposes. &gt;&gt; Look at this in the book of Joshua chapter 7. Joshua 7:es 10-15. The Lord said unto Joshua, get thee up. Wherefore liest thou upon thy face? Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant, which I commanded them. In other words, I give them rules and things that they should go by, but they've transgressed. For they have even taken of the oursed thing and have also stolen and disassembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff. What I do in my home is my business. &gt;&gt; Who am I? my brother's keeper. What I do in my home, it's my business. I one time went to a deacon and I went to him because you know what? His kids weren't doing right. You know what he told me? It's none of your business. &gt;&gt; Yeah. None none of your business. you stay away from my kids. &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Oh, God, &gt;&gt; how can a man be a deacon?" &gt;&gt; Do you know he's supposed to rule his house? Well, &gt;&gt; because if he doesn't know how to rule his house, well, &gt;&gt; how can he rule the house of God? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; This is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I thought, "Oh, oh my." Here's a deacon in a position that's so supposed to help watch over the church of God. And he does it in his own family. He says, "It's my uh uh what I do with my family, what my kids do, it's none of your business." He was in this church. He was in one of my deacons. And I thought, "Oh my, I'm going to have to take him down. Then he told me I'm moving. I thought save me the trouble. &gt;&gt; Don't think it don't happen among all churches. &gt;&gt; Every church, huh? Unless you're denominational and then you just make everybody feel good. We're all going when we all get to heaven. What a day of rejoicing that will be. [Music] It doesn't matter the way I live. It doesn't matter what I do. Keep your mouth off me and my family. &gt;&gt; Oh, excuse me. &gt;&gt; It's not Hey, saints of God, &gt;&gt; pray for your pastor. Yes, &gt;&gt; pray for any man of God. You know why, &gt;&gt; sir? &gt;&gt; Because &gt;&gt; he's got to tell you truth, &gt;&gt; I've got to apply the word with my own family. &gt;&gt; Even when it hurts. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham did it with Billy Paul. &gt;&gt; You know why Brother Brennham kicked Billy Paul out of the house? You know, Billy didn't know that his daddy was home. The car was gone or it was parked out back or something. So anyway, Ma told him, "Billy, you got to go in there. You got to do this. You ain't my mama. You can't tell me what to do." Brother Bram, come out of the back room. Hey, hey, hey, Billy. Come here. Come here, Billy. That's my wife. Any man that doesn't stand for his wife &gt;&gt; when the kids back talk her, &gt;&gt; you know what you're doing? You're teaching your children disobedience. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "Billy, you'll not talk to my wife that way. Kicked him out of the house." &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. kicked him out of the house. They went and lived with Brother Bran's brother and his family. And that was a rough family, drink, smoke, cussing. The Brandham family was not brother Brand said, "Hey, all of my family, they they're rough. They they were bad people." You remember the time that Rebecca and George went back to Jeffersonville because we're going to find in our ancestral heritage somebody in the back ancestral heritage somewhere. We're going to take the line. And my great great uncle, my great greatgrandfather, somebody going to be good somewhere. Said the more we dug the wor. Thank God that God doesn't call us by physical lineage. Amen. &gt;&gt; An illegitimate child shall not enter the congregation &gt;&gt; 10 generations &gt;&gt; for 10 generations. Brother Bren said over 400 years. I want to ask every one of you that have a halo on and you say, "Well, there's nothing in my life." Can you trace your family lineage back 10 generations &gt;&gt; that your great great great great great father he put away his wife without the proper cause, married another woman, had children by him and like this and here come you in the 21st century. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me tell we're all &gt;&gt; You guys remember brother Ed Dalton? &gt;&gt; His wife, Sister Bessie, was illegitimate. &gt;&gt; Oh, it plagued her. She wrote Brother Renham a letter. I've got a copy of the letter. Brother Ed, let me photograph the original letter. He said, she said, "Brother Brennham, I'm an illegitimate child. I've read in the scriptures. I'm paraphrasing right now." I kept it on the back bulletin board for years so you all could read it and said, "I I just need to know because you remember in questions and answers, Brother Brennan, will an illegitimate child go in the rapture?" He said, "Well, I cannot believe that an illegitimate child would be in the perfect will of God and that it would go in the rapture." How many knows he says this in conduct order and doctrine &gt;&gt; questions and answers. So now if you take the legalistic side about it up to 10 generations, &gt;&gt; 400 plus years. Brother Brennham, I'm illegitimate. I want to know, is there any hope? &gt;&gt; Dear Sister Bessie, I'm sitting here in the room with brother Leo Mercer and he's writing this down. And he said actually all of us are illegitimate born under our our prostitute parent &gt;&gt; Eve. &gt;&gt; And he said the new birth corrects it all. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Here was the law. Here was grace coming right back together. Otherwise all of us would say there's no hope. But I am here to tell you because of the blood, &gt;&gt; because of God's covenant, &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter all of your doubts and fears and failures and complexes and this and that &gt;&gt; and this broken and that broken and this divorce and all of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of grace, &gt;&gt; I ain't putting anybody in out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can take it and try to make it all black and white. Let me tell you, nothing is black and white. &gt;&gt; No sin be forgiven you, especially blasphemy. &gt;&gt; That's the only one not forgiven. Paul said, "I'm a blasphemer." Was he forgiven? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It ain't about the person. &gt;&gt; And it ain't about their works. &gt;&gt; It's about the promise. &gt;&gt; God watching over his seed. &gt;&gt; It's all him. It's not you. It ain't how good you've done. It ain't all the things that you've done right. Nor is it all the things you did wrong that's going to condemn you. For by grace are you saved through faith. &gt;&gt; And that is not a work of man. It is by a gift of God, lest any man boast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; I just showed you in Joshua 7, go to verse 13. up. Sanctify the people and say, "Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow. For thus say the Lord God of Israel, there's an thing in the midst of thee, oh Israel, thou cannot stand before thine enemies until you take away the thing from among you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many you of you remember that Joshua said, "Okay." Because the angel said, "Get up your face. Why are you crying? Why cry? Speak. Sin." Right? So they go along. What was the name of the man who came before Joshua? &gt;&gt; Help me out. &gt;&gt; Achen. &gt;&gt; Achen. How many achens do we have within the message? Well, what I do in my tent, I can take up the thing. I'll take Babylonian garments from mystery Babylon. I'll let my daughters dress like harlots. I will eat things sacrificed on the idols. I will hide the Babylonian wedges of silver and gold in my tent. And it it doesn't matter because it's my tent. It's my business. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that little little levan leavenvens the whole lump? &gt;&gt; Israel suffered because of disobedience. &gt;&gt; That's the truth, Lord. Can you imagine that when he came before and Joshua said, "Why have you done this?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Why have you troubled Israel? I didn't think it was that big a thing. He said, "We're losing men." God said, "You you'll win every battle." And now great men, mighty men of valor are being killed. And God said, "They're sinning again." Achen, why have you done that? So he showed him. He ex He said, "Well, yeah, yeah. I went ahead. I brought back the television. I brought back all of the things the things I was supposed to kick out. I brought back all of this stuff, but it's in my tent. It's okay. I'm not I wasn't trying to get everybody over to my tent, but what we did in my family." So Achen affected his family. So they said, "Achen, bring your wife. Bring your children." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; So here comes Achin with his wife and the kids hand in hand walking up there. Um, why are we here before everybody? Daddy. &gt;&gt; Daddy. &gt;&gt; I thought you said it was okay. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; Daddy. Why didn't you tell us, Daddy? Why is everybody so mad? &gt;&gt; Daddy, they're picking up rocks. &gt;&gt; What are they going to do, Daddy? Pretty somber. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You. Daddy, why didn't you tell me? Daddies, I'm gonna here's a solemn warning to every one of you daddies. Because you let down the standard in your home, it will affect your wife and your children and they may miss it all because of you letting down the standard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; Yes. God, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't ever let some kind of thing come in here to defile us. He said, "You've taken of the oursed thing." Second Corinthians 10:es 3-5. Though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds. What are strongholds? When you have opened a door to a spirit and you thought it was okay, &gt;&gt; whether it's rock music, whether it's the wrong kind of movies, whether it is laying down or uh lowering the standard of any part of God's word, &gt;&gt; you have compromised. And when you have compromised and you've allowed that to come in and it starts a stronghold. &gt;&gt; Now what happens when you get a stronghold? Listen to me saints. You open a doorway that God told you to keep shut and a spirit. Brother Brim said as an example, you go and play with a Ouija board. &gt;&gt; You guys know what a Ouija board is? &gt;&gt; It's okay. Come on. I've heard of kids within the message playing with Ouija boards. &gt;&gt; It's witchcraft. &gt;&gt; Take a spirit. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He said you listen to the wrong kind of music, you take a spirit. You put on the wrong kind of clothes, you take a spirit. &gt;&gt; You might have a long dress, but it's a skin down wiener. You took a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because if we lower the standard, guess what? Everybody below that standard now gets compromised. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We are either influenced from above or from below. Watch this. 1954, Brother Brennan preaches the most interesting sermon called the invasion of the USA. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I was born in the USA. I was born in the USA. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right on, brother. You got your rights, don't you? Was born in the USA. &gt;&gt; Watch the invasion of the USA. Hallelujah. I say that because I feel the Holy Spirit is here. The invasion is on. Just sweeping from house to house, &gt;&gt; from place to place, from church to church, &gt;&gt; and from man to man. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the devil. &gt;&gt; The invasion's on. &gt;&gt; I ain't saying nothing about this individual or that individual. See, I'm saying it's unclean spirits that are possessing the people. &gt;&gt; That's right. Do you see? He can tell by what they're manifesting. It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Okay. Dividing between spirit and soul. &gt;&gt; The invasion of the United States to overthrow the church. The church is overthrowed by the devil. You see, whichever you yield your spirit to, you become the servant thereof. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just yielding myself a little bit to this and a little bit of the world and a little bit of this and that. Next thing you know, don't you realize, be not deceived. &gt;&gt; God is not mocked. &gt;&gt; For whatsoever you sow, that shall you reap. If you sow to the flesh, you shall of the re the flesh what? &gt;&gt; Reap corruption. &gt;&gt; Well, how'd this happen? I don't understand, brother. Wh Why is my family Why Why is this happening? You let down the bars. &gt;&gt; Why cry? You know what you're doing? &gt;&gt; Because you either sow to righteousness or you sow to unrighteousness. What's happening right now among the message is there is a purging from unbelief &gt;&gt; because the wheat is going to be separated from the shuck because the shuck is not heir &gt;&gt; with the wheat. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that this is a judgment? &gt;&gt; The house of God is a house of judgment. And if the righteous scarcely be saved, what about the sinner and the ungodly? &gt;&gt; If the token is not applied to our lives and to our homes, &gt;&gt; we're deceiving ourselves. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to apply the token? &gt;&gt; Do we just confess it while we've got the token and then we let every all of the world come in and our kids can do anything in their room? And as long as they close the door and what they do in their room, it's Oh, hey, what? Wait a second, Joshua. I thought about me and my and if you disagree with it and you get old enough, &gt;&gt; huh? Right? &gt;&gt; There's so many of you young kids. Oh, I can't wait till I grow up. Can't wait to get out of the house. I don't have to go to school. I can get a car. I can go to work and I can do my own thing. Uh-huh. Then you come courting some young girl in the church. They come to me, "Brother Ron, what do you think?" Ain't no way. Don't even consider that guy. I showed you that clip years ago and I don't mean to make a make a a a joke. The young man came to his pastor. He said, "Pastor," he said, 'You know, he said, 'Really, I I want you to pray for me. I want to I I want to get married. I want to have a family. I want to have kids. And so the pastor said, "Oh, you do? I do. Do you have a job?" "No, no. Well, you know, I the the boss, he and I didn't get along." And you know, we So, I quit and this and that. And he said, "Well, do you have a place to take her?" "Well, no. you know, I'm still at home and uh you know, on and on. And he asked a few more questions. He said, "But will you pray for me?" He said, "Yeah, yeah." He says, "Heavenly Father, pray that you keep this man as far away from our girls." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, fathers. &gt;&gt; I'll pray for you. All right. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch this in the sermon that brother Rem preaches out. But this is good. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? This is where we live. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is where we live. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in the sermon, the token, believe what? Believe the Lord Jesus Christ for your house. Apply the token to your house. Then what do you do when you apply it to your house? Move all the trash out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get all the short skirts, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Brother Brandon, young girls, mothers, &gt;&gt; mama, if you're wearing a a skirt that is right at knee length and you play tugof-war when you sit down, &gt;&gt; what's your daughter going to be like? &gt;&gt; You got it. &gt;&gt; The short skirts I would like to see. You know, I'm I'm not a legalist, but I'd love to see the dresses among our sisters getting longer, not shorter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the dress don't make you holy, &gt;&gt; but the Holy Ghost inside of you will tell you that's too short. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; How tight is too tight? How short is too short? &gt;&gt; Do you see? Huh? Is it okay if the dress is right at the knee? &gt;&gt; Is it okay? Then when I sit down, doesn't that make you uncomfortable? &gt;&gt; What if it's too tight? And they walk like this and then they come to stairs. God forbid there be a fire. I'm not trying to be a &gt;&gt; Let me ask you another question. If your dress is too short and you wear leggings, is that permissible? &gt;&gt; No. leggings are really becoming very popular because if your girls are going to play sports, well then ah I can't run in a long skirt, so I got I'll put a shorter skirt on and I'll put leggings on. &gt;&gt; Hey, it's getting real silent in here. &gt;&gt; Amen. You ever seen what holiness women did years ago when they went snowk skiing? Do you know that they even climbed &gt;&gt; mountain peaks and everything and they wore long dresses? &gt;&gt; They skied in long dresses. In fact, there was one time that my daughter and a bunch of the sisters went skiing. I believe it was up in in Canada with some of the Canadian sisters up there and they had their long dresses and they were they were skiing and hey, nothing wrong with skiing. And guess what? Some guys skied up to him and said, "That is so cool. I love it." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, don't be ashamed of what you believe. Don't be don't dare to let me say dare to be different. &gt;&gt; Don't see how close to the edge you can come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any of you see people that they they come up to a cliff and [Music] &gt;&gt; Huh? I I I don't even like to see kids up getting close to the edge. You know, I'm one of these guys. As I get on my belly, I call up. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, how close to the edge do you want to get? &gt;&gt; Do you want to be a borderline believer? &gt;&gt; All the way. &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way. &gt;&gt; All the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way. &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way with my Lord. &gt;&gt; How many of you say, "I'm going all the way." &gt;&gt; I'm not attacking people. &gt;&gt; I'm not going after people. &gt;&gt; It's spirits. &gt;&gt; Because once we let down the bars, &gt;&gt; how did the camel get in the tent? One foot at a time. &gt;&gt; Huh? Oh, please, mister. Please. Oh, just let me get my head inside the tent. It's a It's a sandstorm outside. Oh, please just say head in. And it's okay if just one leg. And then and then pretty soon, yeah, the the second leg and everything. And guess what? Now all of a sudden, he's in the tent. How do you get in? &gt;&gt; One little piece at a time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're talking about spiritual warfare. We're talking about the opening of the seals &gt;&gt; was an exposing of Satan coming into the church trying to make it lukewarm, &gt;&gt; formal, and powerless. &gt;&gt; Sister Vicki, God bless you. It's good to see you. Come on. I've been believing this message since I was 18. I've been a fanatic for it. Have I made my mistakes? Yes, absolutely. But I want to go all the way. &gt;&gt; I have determined in my heart If none don't go, it won't hinder me. &gt;&gt; If none don't go, it won't hinder me. &gt;&gt; If none don't go, it won't hinder me. Why? I'm going all the way. &gt;&gt; I have purposed in my heart. I would rather quit and step down from the ministry than to compromise with what I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I really would. &gt;&gt; And if you want somebody that is a socializer, a compromiser or something, &gt;&gt; it ain't me. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brennham said, he says, "And now watch, he says, depending on what kind what kind of filter you have, &gt;&gt; you'll find a church that will satisfy &gt;&gt; that worldly man's taste. But if you have a Holy Ghost filter, &gt;&gt; the last quote, musicians, if you've come, God bless you. I love you guys. &gt;&gt; I do. Love's corrective. Is it right, brother D? &gt;&gt; David, you know what I love about you? You don't quit. &gt;&gt; You don't quit. &gt;&gt; Have you fallen? &gt;&gt; We've had our talks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you keep coming. &gt;&gt; You keep sitting on the front row. &gt;&gt; Why don't you sit on the back row? You're so tall anyway people can't see around you. &gt;&gt; David, I love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the fact that you keep coming because I've not been easy on you and you know that some of the rest of you, you know that. &gt;&gt; Had to come to you. Had to come to you about your kids. [Music] You got to be tough to keep coming when you get scolded and you have a little bit of corrective, right? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I just trust that I I didn't do it in a wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Okay. I trust that my spirit is Christlike. Sandy and I were listening to the tape last night. Do you remember the name of the tape of Sandy? God of this evil age. And my brother Brennan preached so hard. I thought, "Oh my, the God of this evil age." Well, there's only one thing that exposes the God of this evil age, and that's the word of God for this hour. [Music] &gt;&gt; I trust more and more of you get into it. Find out what he said &gt;&gt; because the sword when it's unshathed when Sabino Canyon happened, guess what? It declared war. &gt;&gt; And that's why the doors were closing everywhere. Denominations closed the door. No longer. I sit in down in Tucson. No one even invites me. [Music] No wonder he he was [Music] dejected. &gt;&gt; What good is it done? All of this. Then God said, "You want to see beyond the curtain of time? &gt;&gt; You want to see?" Yeah, I would. I I wonder how many are going to be there &gt;&gt; because I saw so very few actually receiving the word for this hour. I saw very few. There weren't no evening light tabernacles and and end time gospel evangelism and all the there no none. There was a a little bit here and a little bit in a little group. Maybe a couple people listening to tapes here and there. So they said, "You want to see?" Yeah, I'd like to. Out of body experience goes beyond the curtain of time. He looks and he sees thousands and thousands. He said, "Are these all brandoms?" He said, "No, no, these are your converts." Listen, Malachi 4 had already gone off the scene. Revelations 10:7 had already died and was buried. I didn't come into the message till 1971. [Music] But God, it it says in the days of the voice, somebody say voice. &gt;&gt; Voice. &gt;&gt; The days of the voice, not of his life. He said even after I'm gone, you watch these tapes will go on being played. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God that we got these tapes. Thank God. &gt;&gt; Huh? God, what a mess we would be in if we didn't have the tapes to go back and listen to. &gt;&gt; There'd be so much confusion. This man this and that and over here and what do you believe and thank God for the tapes. That's why I encourage every one of you. You listen to them tapes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You go home, you listen to them with your children. You give them seals books and church age books and let them read for themselves. get into it. &gt;&gt; You apply the token. You teach them war. &gt;&gt; You teach them. [Music] &gt;&gt; He says because you know what they're fight. &gt;&gt; He says in the sermon, the contest, he said every one of you going to fight him. Every one of you. The contest is on. Depends on how you learn to fight. Any of you seen somebody who don't know how to fight? Stop it. You want somebody know how to fight. All of a sudden, you come up and they're they're challenge you. Hey. Hey. You feeling froggy? &gt;&gt; And then you watch the stance. &gt;&gt; Yeah. cuz they're preparing. &gt;&gt; Huh? You may think you're big bad. Brother Brennham went in and he want I want to be big bad Bill. I want to be a a boxer and his trainer. Huh? What was the name of his trainer? &gt;&gt; Six. &gt;&gt; Six seconds. because he knows most of the time if he ever got to boxing you around, you lasted about six seconds and you was knocked out. He says, "Why in the world when I get in the ring with you try to knock my head off?" He said, "Cuz Bill, when you get in that ring," he said, "That's what they're gonna do to you." They asked Mike Tyson, "Well, you have a plan about how you're gonna fight that guy." He said, "Yeah, the plan goes out the window the moment the first time your bell gets rung. Then it's against the ropes and it's okay." Huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want to teach you guys war. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do. I want to take our young girls or our young men, our young couples. &gt;&gt; I want to teach you war because you know what? You're going to face the enemy. You're going to see the enemy and you're going to be in the contest. &gt;&gt; I don't want any of you failures. I don't want to lose any of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to take as many as you. &gt;&gt; Of you I can take with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you going to scream and holler and fight and that's okay. I'm going to do everything I can. &gt;&gt; Amen. try to take you with me. &gt;&gt; Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. &gt;&gt; Keep me true, Lord Jesus. keep me to truth.
