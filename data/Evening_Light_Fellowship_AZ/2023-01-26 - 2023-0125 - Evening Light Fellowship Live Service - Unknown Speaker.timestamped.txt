[30:58] how many of you have ever had God speak
[31:00] to you from a song
[31:02] huh absolutely God will give somebody a
[31:05] song put on your heart they sing and
[31:07] guess what you got touched maybe he got
[31:09] delivered maybe got healed whatever you
[31:11] know because what it did it cause you
[31:13] for some reason to get into that and
[31:16] believe that God is uh God was speaking
[31:19] to you amen amen so Genesis chapter 11
[31:23] verses 1 through 9. and the whole earth
[31:27] was of one language
[31:30] and of one speech
[31:32] and it came to pass as they journeyed
[31:34] from the East
[31:35] that they found a plane in the land of
[31:37] shinar
[31:39] and they dwelt there and they said one
[31:41] to another
[31:43] go to and let us make brick and burn
[31:47] them thoroughly and they had brick for
[31:50] stone and slime they had for Mortar
[31:53] and they said go to let us build a city
[31:58] and a tower
[32:00] whose talk May reach into heaven
[32:03] and let us make a name
[32:07] lest we get lest we be scattered abroad
[32:10] upon the face of the Earth
[32:13] and the Lord came down to see the city
[32:15] and the tower which the children of men
[32:18] building
[32:20] and the Lord said behold the people is
[32:22] one
[32:23] and they have all one language
[32:26] and this they began to do and now
[32:30] nothing will be restrained from them
[32:32] which they have imagined to do
[32:35] go to let us go down
[32:39] and there confound their language
[32:42] that they may not understand one
[32:45] another's speech
[32:47] so the Lord scattered them abroad from
[32:50] fence upon the face of the Earth
[32:52] face of all the Earth
[32:54] and they left off to build the city
[32:59] therefore is the name of it called Babel
[33:03] because the Lord did there confound the
[33:06] languages of all the Earth
[33:08] and from fence did the Lord scatter them
[33:11] abroad upon all the face of all the
[33:15] Earth
[33:16] amen turn with me to the book of
[33:19] Zephaniah one of the smaller books there
[33:24] just past habakkuk and and everything
[33:27] you know sometimes I have to look and
[33:29] find that because when you look at those
[33:32] Minor Prophets there you go nahim have a
[33:35] cook there's Zephaniah uh hag guy you
[33:40] know I've never preached from some of
[33:42] these um
[33:43] smaller books but I'm taking here uh uh
[33:47] from Zephaniah 3 verse 9.
[33:51] if you're there Say Amen
[33:53] all right for then will I turn to the
[33:56] people of pure language
[33:59] that they may all call upon the name of
[34:01] the Lord
[34:02] to serve him with one consent may the
[34:07] Lord add the blessing to his word you

[34:55] and we see him of the lineage of Cain
[34:58] and brother Brown said you want to know
[34:59] where civilization came from he said
[35:02] modern day civilization is uh is from
[35:06] the lineage of King
[35:08] and uh so uh brother Stephen Coffey when
[35:13] he was here he he touched on a similar
[35:16] subject on this here and he had preached
[35:18] about God confounding the language I
[35:21] thought that you know that's interesting
[35:22] and he said something and he mentioned
[35:25] the scripture there in Zephaniah so us
[35:27] Brothers uh we've gone from The Golden
[35:31] Boys
[35:32] to the Over the Hill Gang
[35:34] now to the table of the Gods
[35:38] it really is something these guys are
[35:39] amazing
[35:41] so anyway they're on Monday morning
[35:43] these Brethren got together and we got
[35:45] to talking about one language we
[35:48] actually got to visit about this and
[35:50] they said what was that scripture in
[35:52] Zephaniah and Zephaniah 3 and 9 and we
[35:55] begin to read it and we were just kind
[35:58] of going over this and we began to kind
[36:00] of discuss this topic
[36:02] and I thought well that'd be interesting
[36:06] so I went ahead and researched it and I
[36:09] think it'll be a blessing to you
[36:11] um
[36:12] this evening I pray so
[36:15] um revelation
[36:17] is what God uses to make his word known
[36:20] to you
[36:22] for faith is a revelation faith is an
[36:25] illumination faith is sight
[36:28] faith is you being able to understand
[36:31] God's word otherwise it's a sealed book
[36:35] so any of you that catch the
[36:37] understanding of the mysteries of God
[36:40] what God is doing is he's giving you
[36:42] understanding
[36:44] and that's what he does with Parables he
[36:47] does something in the natural
[36:49] okay referring to something spiritual
[36:52] but the disciples said why is it that
[36:56] you always speak to the people in
[36:59] parables
[37:00] and he said to them it's not given
[37:04] he said but to you it's given that you
[37:07] might see these things so understand
[37:10] that faith is the illumination that God
[37:14] uses to make his word known to you to
[37:18] your understanding faith is catching
[37:20] what the spirit is saying
[37:25] the word pure in Hebrew
[37:28] because it we took Zephaniah and said a
[37:30] pure language what does a pure language
[37:34] uh what does it mean it means all
[37:36] cleansed it means all refined clearly
[37:40] polished pure purged
[37:44] and I thought isn't that what the Holy
[37:46] Ghost does when he comes in where who he
[37:50] comes into our lives and he gives us a
[37:53] new language
[37:55] because the Holy Ghost comes in and
[37:57] purges you and takes your old
[38:00] conversation the way that you spoke
[38:02] before gives you a new life huh
[38:05] Hallelujah it gives you a new tongue a
[38:07] new understanding
[38:10] praise the Lord yes
[38:13] so
[38:15] it is a refined or pureed language
[38:19] from false doctrines
[38:22] and teachings of mystery Babylon
[38:26] now I wish to make a little bit of a
[38:28] parallel on this this evening
[38:32] um and Revelation is also what causes
[38:35] you
[38:37] to come to God's provided place of
[38:40] worship
[38:41] brother Branham said without
[38:43] understanding where God has placed his
[38:45] name
[38:47] he said because in that name and that
[38:50] name alone is where God is provided a
[38:53] place of true worship
[38:58] and faith is the key also that unlocks
[39:02] the door of the scriptures and Christ is
[39:06] that door
[39:10] and faith is a victory that overcomes
[39:12] the world
[39:14] so God has sent to us a message in this
[39:17] end time and it's become the language if
[39:21] you please of the redeemed bride
[39:25] the message is God's love language that
[39:29] he's sent to you because he sent you a
[39:31] letter and brother Branham said you read
[39:34] the letter from somebody that is your
[39:37] sweetheart or your lover and he says and
[39:39] you read between the lines
[39:41] Hallelujah are you catching where where
[39:44] I'm going with this
[39:46] that this message is God's love letter
[39:49] to you as a Believer because you're
[39:51] catching that which was unspoken
[39:55] those mystery secrets that he's he's
[39:58] giving to you in your ear in your ear
[40:00] alone
[40:02] Hallelujah
[40:05] so without faith it is impossible to
[40:08] please God
[40:10] neither can you understand God because
[40:14] the carnal mind is enmity with God
[40:16] neither does it know the things of God
[40:19] someone else and perhaps that's a
[40:22] unbeliever or whoever
[40:25] you're sharing with them something that
[40:28] they look to you like you're an alien
[40:31] that you're speaking a language and I
[40:34] want you to understand that this message
[40:36] is a language that very few people
[40:39] understand but you that are the
[40:41] initiated you that are have caught the
[40:44] Revelation what God's doing we talk
[40:46] about predestination it goes right over
[40:49] their head they can't understand talks
[40:51] about election the election word birth
[40:54] those things that is we have a secret
[40:57] language you talk to a denomination
[41:00] right over their head
[41:02] they can't catch it
[41:05] why it's another language
[41:12] because the message is Christ and Christ
[41:14] is the word
[41:17] and though many heard the voice of Jesus
[41:19] speaking to them
[41:21] it was only the elect that heard what
[41:23] the voice was saying
[41:26] now when we look at the word voice it
[41:28] actually in the Greek word is phone
[41:33] p-h-o-n-e just like we have a phone
[41:38] and it says it means the sayings
[41:42] or the language or the understanding of
[41:46] what is being said
[41:49] to voice yourself actually means to
[41:52] express your thoughts by using
[41:54] vocalization
[41:57] now brother Brenham says in the sermon
[42:00] voice of God in the last days
[42:04] he says God has promised to meet the
[42:06] need of the hour and he always and he
[42:09] always does that
[42:11] how many of you know that he said
[42:14] he said the end time message will meet
[42:17] the end time conditions
[42:19] so I don't want any of you to think that
[42:22] any of you are shortchanged that that
[42:24] you were born out of due season I should
[42:27] have been in another no you are here in
[42:30] this age and God has given every one of
[42:32] us that care package of his word
[42:35] to get you to the resurrection
[42:39] amen
[42:41] he always does that and we need the
[42:43] voice of God today to meet the need of
[42:46] the hour
[42:47] to meet the time that we're living in
[42:50] and today one reason that church is in
[42:52] the condition that it's in
[42:55] is because there's so many voices so
[42:58] many other voices to attract the church
[43:00] from the voice of God
[43:02] till it's very doubtful that many would
[43:05] hear the voice of God though it spoke
[43:08] right in their midst
[43:10] they perhaps wouldn't even understand it
[43:14] because it would be a foreign thing to
[43:18] them they got themselves so much
[43:21] centered on the voices of the day
[43:24] God has a voice that he's using today
[43:28] amen even as Elijah heard a small steel
[43:32] voice
[43:35] God speaks in many various ways
[43:39] as I told you he can speak you through
[43:41] his song through a friend
[43:43] through his sickness through a
[43:45] circumstance through dreams Visions
[43:47] reading the word preaching the word
[43:51] through a pillar of fire through a
[43:53] whirlwind or even a donkey
[43:58] but by the most popular way is by the
[44:01] foolishness of preaching
[44:04] but until you hear the spirit speaking
[44:07] you may be religious but you're not
[44:09] spiritual
[44:13] you are not spiritual until you're
[44:15] hearing what the spirit is saying to the
[44:17] church
[44:19] I would guesstimate that the vast
[44:21] majority of people in Christendom today
[44:24] that claim to be Christians have never
[44:28] ever heard what the spirit is saying to
[44:31] the church
[44:32] but you're different why you have an ear
[44:36] to hear you have heard what God is doing
[44:38] in this sea
[44:40] many are merely outwardly religious
[44:43] people
[44:45] they've been programmed by Church
[44:47] systems and Creeds and dogmas
[44:50] and they depend on others who they have
[44:54] put their
[44:55] faith in that they will tell them what
[44:58] to do
[45:00] and we're not careful that same type of
[45:02] mental programming will come right into
[45:05] the message listen I don't want you to
[45:08] learn this message
[45:10] I want you to live this message
[45:13] I want you to catch the revelation of
[45:16] Jesus Christ because Revelation to your
[45:20] soul is what transforms you huh from
[45:25] Earthly to Heavenly
[45:28] from Marvel to immortality
[45:36] in thy seed shall possess the gay
[45:38] brother Branham said
[45:41] um
[45:41] I could point you Assemblies of God
[45:44] people that's got deacons on their board
[45:46] that's married two or three times
[45:48] preachers carrying on
[45:51] women with their hair cut wearing shorts
[45:53] makeup still professing to have the Holy
[45:56] Ghost depending on the evidence of
[45:59] speaking in tongues or jumping up and
[46:01] down and shouting
[46:03] they failed that still small voice of
[46:08] the word
[46:10] amen they failed one thing they had all
[46:14] this other stuff
[46:15] but they failed what was most important
[46:18] to cause their lives to get changed and
[46:21] that's to hear what the spirit is saying
[46:23] to the church
[46:26] unless the gospel we hear is mixed with
[46:29] faith it'll do us no good
[46:35] is it possible for us to hear
[46:38] his voice and failed to catch the
[46:40] meaning
[46:41] failed to understand what the messenger
[46:44] is saying
[46:47] I'm quoting John 16 verses 12 through
[46:50] 16. Jesus speaking I have yet many
[46:53] things to say unto you now
[46:55] to say unto you
[46:57] but you cannot bear them now
[47:01] be it when he the spirit of Truth has
[47:04] come
[47:06] he will guide you into all truth
[47:09] understand that that the Holy Spirit
[47:12] brother Brown said is the Divine
[47:15] revealer of the word of God
[47:18] now Jesus was speaking to his disciples
[47:21] he said I'd love to tell you of great
[47:24] and wonderful powerful things
[47:27] but you cannot bear them now
[47:29] be it when the time comes
[47:32] when the Holy Ghost comes that Divine
[47:35] revealer he'll reveal unto you all truth
[47:41] amen show you things to come those
[47:44] things I've spoken unto you in Proverbs
[47:47] with the time coming
[47:49] when I shall no more speak to you in
[47:52] Proverbs
[47:54] but I shall show you plainly of the
[47:58] father
[47:59] this message
[48:01] is become becoming clearer and clearer
[48:05] and we're not talking about removing the
[48:09] static and the background noises from
[48:12] the tapes
[48:13] we're talking about clearer
[48:15] understanding
[48:17] we're talking about something that's no
[48:19] longer a mystery we're talking about God
[48:22] coming down by way of the Holy Spirit
[48:25] and by the maturing of the Bride she's
[48:28] no longer a little child
[48:30] amen she's a full-grown woman and she
[48:34] has virtue and character and you watch
[48:38] her and she catches what her bridegroom
[48:41] is telling her
[48:43] Hallelujah
[48:46] that is this time now there's an
[48:49] unveiling of God
[48:51] is no longer hid in parables
[48:54] he's no longer hid behind a veil of
[48:57] mystery why the mystery of God has been
[49:01] revealed
[49:04] does it not say in Revelations 3 and
[49:07] verse 20-22 behold I stand at the door
[49:11] and knock
[49:12] If any man hear my voice
[49:15] and open the door I will come into him
[49:17] and sup with him and he with me
[49:20] to him that overcometh will I grant him
[49:22] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[49:25] overcame and sat down with my father in
[49:27] his throne
[49:28] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[49:31] the spirit saith unto the churches
[49:34] for you to be able to perceive
[49:37] to understand to catch it
[49:40] I look up the word perceive in Hebrew it
[49:44] means yada
[49:45] it means to know properly or to
[49:48] ascertain by seeing it by understanding
[49:53] the ability to know or understand by way
[49:56] of Supernatural instruction
[49:59] Hallelujah do you realize that when
[50:02] you're catching Revelation when God
[50:05] gives you an epiphany of his scripture
[50:08] what it is you're actually catching
[50:11] something that God himself is giving to
[50:15] you and what he's doing he's speaking
[50:18] lip to ear
[50:20] somebody say Amen
[50:27] amen
[50:29] let me show you
[50:31] an example of Jesus speaking
[50:34] and he very openly says why do you not
[50:38] understand me
[50:39] in Saint John 8 verses 43-47.
[50:46] why do you not understand my speech
[50:50] even because you cannot hear my word
[50:56] now they're hearing his voice are they
[50:59] not
[51:00] they're hearing the vocalization they're
[51:04] hearing the language that he's speaking
[51:07] he said but why don't you understand my
[51:09] speech because you can't understand my
[51:13] word
[51:14] because if you understand the logos
[51:16] thought of God you're going to catch my
[51:18] thought
[51:19] why because the things that I'm speaking
[51:22] to you
[51:24] are coming from him
[51:28] you are you up your father the devil
[51:32] the lusts of your father you will do he
[51:35] was a murderer from the beginning
[51:37] a boat not in the truth because there's
[51:38] no truth in him when he speak of the
[51:41] light he speaks of his own
[51:43] for he's a liar and a father of it
[51:45] because I tell you truth you believe me
[51:47] not
[51:50] which of you convinced me of sin
[51:53] and if I say the truth why do you not
[51:55] believe me
[51:56] he that is of god listen to this he that
[51:59] is of god he that has begotten of God
[52:02] heareth God's words
[52:06] ye therefore hear them not because
[52:09] you are not of god wow no wonder they
[52:13] wanted to kill him and crucify him
[52:19] he said you don't understand my speech
[52:22] because you don't understand my word
[52:26] they didn't understand the voice behind
[52:29] The Voice
[52:30] they didn't understand there was a sign
[52:33] but there was a voice behind the sign
[52:35] are you with me stay with me now because
[52:38] some heard the voice but they failed to
[52:41] understand because they looked at the
[52:43] veil and many times brother Branham says
[52:45] that we miss what God is telling us
[52:48] because we got too much concentration on
[52:51] the veil and he said it is the human
[52:53] Veil God help us to preach tonight that
[52:57] the human Veil is what keeps you from
[53:00] hearing from God so much of the time
[53:03] God help us go Beyond the Veil
[53:08] amen
[53:10] many heard the voice of Jesus Christ
[53:14] but very few heard the voice behind the
[53:17] veil
[53:19] very few heard The Voice Within
[53:23] The Voice
[53:27] God give us Revelation and understanding
[53:32] in the Serpent's Seed brother brennam
[53:35] says this and I want you to turn with me
[53:38] now over into the Book of Genesis of the
[53:40] third chapter
[53:42] if you want to know anything I can show
[53:44] you in the Book of Genesis where every
[53:46] cult and every ism
[53:48] and everything that was got right today
[53:51] begins in Genesis
[53:53] Genesis means beginning we find the
[53:56] Catholic church in the beginning
[53:58] Babylon nimrod
[54:00] the founder we find it in the middle of
[54:03] the Bible we find it in the last of the
[54:05] Bible and we find trying to bring in
[54:07] women preachers
[54:09] in the beginning of the Bible by
[54:11] worshiping little statues made out of
[54:13] roots
[54:14] how many red his slops Two Babylons the
[54:17] history
[54:18] now I tell you what brother Branham did
[54:20] some reading
[54:22] and brother Branham would take history
[54:26] alone to prove and if you read hislops
[54:31] to Babylons he makes the comparison
[54:34] of the old Babylon its ways how they
[54:37] worshiped what they did to mystery
[54:40] Babylon
[54:42] okay
[54:44] and he began to show you the idolatry of
[54:49] Mr Excuse me of ancient Babylon
[54:52] Now understand we have
[54:55] Babylon is in Ruins
[54:58] it is
[55:00] archaeologists have to dig it up to go
[55:03] find it
[55:04] but there is another Babylon that is
[55:06] alive and well today and we by spiritual
[55:10] understanding realize that it's here
[55:14] mystery Babylon
[55:18] and you remember when Jacob stole his
[55:20] father's gods and his daughter hid him
[55:22] under her
[55:24] and took them out there in the
[55:25] wilderness which defailed the camp later
[55:28] on
[55:30] okay
[55:32] earnestly contending for the faith
[55:35] hang on I'm going somewhere understand
[55:38] that when a minister preaches to you
[55:40] he's actually taking you somewhere
[55:44] so I want you to follow along on this
[55:46] journey
[55:47] when Babylon first appeared look at it
[55:51] down through the Bible Babylon appeared
[55:53] back there you know Nimrod built Babylon
[55:56] first Babylon was called the Gates of
[55:59] Heaven
[56:00] then it was called confusion
[56:03] there's where idolatry first started
[56:07] Nimrod was the son of ham
[56:09] which come back
[56:12] from the son of Cain and watch them
[56:15] Kneads as they come up watch what they
[56:18] bear watch the actions they take and
[56:22] we're plum in above the skies with it
[56:25] the crop has grown up oh I hope God
[56:29] soaks that way down deep now so you can
[56:33] get a foundation I need I
[56:36] and I see something moving up
[56:41] now
[56:44] I want you to understand God confounded
[56:47] a language back there in Babylon did he
[56:51] not
[56:52] he did it for a purpose because the
[56:54] people were United together and whatever
[56:58] was upon their mind in the imagine of
[57:01] their heart they could do
[57:03] so God said lest they do that let's
[57:06] confound their language and because he
[57:09] confounded the language they had to quit
[57:13] building the city
[57:15] Now understand spiritually speaking
[57:18] Satan is not happy with letting that go
[57:23] because his seed is still doing the very
[57:27] the exact same thing and I wish to show
[57:29] you that here in just a few moments
[57:34] now
[57:36] he confounded the language so they
[57:38] didn't understand one another
[57:41] and I want you to understand if God's
[57:44] going to return us back to a pure
[57:46] language
[57:48] he's going to redefine a refine it he's
[57:51] going to make it to where we understand
[57:53] it we're all in one Accord in one
[57:55] consent
[57:56] is that right
[57:59] in Acts chapter 2 verses 8 through 12.
[58:03] when the Holy Spirit come down
[58:06] now
[58:07] how here we every man in our own tongue
[58:12] wherein we were born parthenians medes
[58:16] elamites Mesopotamia Judea Cappadocia
[58:20] Pontius and Asia
[58:23] virgin pamphilia in Egypt and he goes on
[58:26] Libya about Cyrene strangers of Rome
[58:30] Jews and proselytes
[58:33] Creeds and Arabians
[58:35] we do hear them speak in our tongue the
[58:39] wonderful works of God
[58:41] now I want you to understand when the
[58:44] Holy Ghost came down upon those
[58:46] Believers he gave them a language
[58:51] the Holy Ghost is a Giver of God's
[58:56] language
[58:57] that language is faith
[59:00] they were speaking under divine
[59:03] inspiration the wonderful works of God
[59:07] so what language is it
[59:10] faith
[59:14] some people say will it be German or
[59:16] Russian or Hebrew or whatever even over
[59:19] there in Romanian Hungary one of the
[59:21] Romanians said I think it's going to be
[59:23] Hungarian because Hungarian will take a
[59:26] lifetime to learn it correctly
[59:31] because with you are we gonna all speak
[59:33] English over there French
[59:36] kishwahili Burundi I don't know I know
[59:40] this
[59:41] that you won't have to learn it
[59:44] it'll be there
[59:46] some didn't have to go to school to
[59:48] learn English
[59:49] Adam was born and when he when he began
[59:52] to speak the Breath of God gave him life
[59:55] gave me moderates let me tell you that's
[59:58] what God does with you when he gives you
[1:00:00] life he gives you utterance
[1:00:03] won't be something you have to go and
[1:00:05] learn and learn the tensed and uh dirty
[1:00:08] Doss like in German or in Spanish you
[1:00:11] know the masculine feminine and neuter
[1:00:15] I never learned that with German
[1:00:17] how do you tell if that table is
[1:00:19] feminine neuter or masculine
[1:00:23] they said and I thought well tell me you
[1:00:26] guys are German everything is calculated
[1:00:28] they're organized they go by the rule
[1:00:31] and he said we just learned it by memory
[1:00:33] I said well thanks man I can't even
[1:00:37] there's no rule
[1:00:41] anyway
[1:00:43] so what I'm saying
[1:00:46] they all began to hear their own
[1:00:50] works of God in their own language
[1:00:54] though they knew these
[1:00:57] how were galileans
[1:01:00] now some of you that are from a foreign
[1:01:03] country now
[1:01:04] and you speak a dialect
[1:01:07] our sisters sitting right here on the
[1:01:10] second row they have a earpiece in their
[1:01:12] ear and we have a translator in the back
[1:01:14] room
[1:01:16] now I tell you what they would their
[1:01:19] eyes would get wide open if all of a
[1:01:22] sudden they heard me speaking their
[1:01:23] dialect
[1:01:30] because they would know I don't speak
[1:01:32] dear dialing
[1:01:34] so I want to just show you some hearing
[1:01:37] questions and answers
[1:01:40] they ask a question at one time were we
[1:01:43] all white or colored or or two which one
[1:01:46] of the curse was put on as far as I know
[1:01:48] I can't tell you
[1:01:50] that's what he said I don't know and it
[1:01:51] really doesn't matter white brown yellow
[1:01:54] black don't matter
[1:01:56] I kind of tell you as we come of all one
[1:01:59] language and one people
[1:02:02] until the Tower of Babel a confusion
[1:02:05] and then their language is went
[1:02:08] different
[1:02:09] and as as far as We Know they were all
[1:02:13] one people till that time
[1:02:15] and they broke up and Scattered in
[1:02:17] different parts of the world
[1:02:20] so when the people were scattered into
[1:02:22] different parts of the world they were
[1:02:24] all broke up because of language they
[1:02:27] couldn't understand one another
[1:02:31] so what God is going to do in this end
[1:02:33] time he's going to restore us back
[1:02:40] I'm going somewhere with this now just
[1:02:42] hang on don't freak out
[1:02:45] God is going to bring the elect seed
[1:02:48] back for a rapture
[1:02:50] and he will send them a pure language in
[1:02:53] other words it's going to be re-defined
[1:02:57] it's going to be refined it's going to
[1:03:00] be circumcised
[1:03:02] the Flesh of man and the knowledge of
[1:03:06] man is going to be circumcised from it
[1:03:08] and you're going to have a pure word
[1:03:11] Hallelujah do you understand
[1:03:14] Hallelujah he had to pull brother
[1:03:16] Brenham away from hislops to Babylons
[1:03:19] from Clarence Larkin and pre niacin
[1:03:23] fathers and had to get him into a room
[1:03:25] by himself
[1:03:28] Hallelujah and the empty out his own
[1:03:30] thinking and the Holy Spirit by way of
[1:03:34] angels coming to him and those angels
[1:03:37] broke to him
[1:03:39] each one came and gave him the
[1:03:41] revelation of each seal
[1:03:44] first Angel first seal and so on
[1:03:50] so that language is the language listen
[1:03:53] to this that the Holy Ghost speaks
[1:03:57] revelation
[1:03:59] is the language of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:03] can you accept that
[1:04:05] because when he speaks to you and he's
[1:04:07] giving you Revelation it's his voice and
[1:04:11] he's showing you something so the voice
[1:04:13] you're hearing
[1:04:15] is the language
[1:04:18] come on come on now
[1:04:22] so what he does now remember in Matthew
[1:04:24] 24 verse 31 he will send his angels
[1:04:27] with a great sound of a trumpet and they
[1:04:30] shall gather together his leg from the
[1:04:32] Four Winds and from one end of Heaven to
[1:04:35] the other
[1:04:36] in Ephesians 1 9-10 having made known
[1:04:40] under the mystery of his will remember
[1:04:44] he's making known the mystery of his
[1:04:46] will
[1:04:47] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:04:49] purposed in himself
[1:04:51] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:04:54] of times he might gather together
[1:04:57] in one all things in Christ
[1:05:01] both which are in heaven are rich in our
[1:05:03] Earth which are in him
[1:05:06] this message is what is causing the
[1:05:09] bright believers to be gathered together
[1:05:12] until they come into the unity of the
[1:05:15] faith and faith is revelation
[1:05:17] is that right
[1:05:21] this message is not an Earthly
[1:05:24] message
[1:05:26] it's a Heavenly message
[1:05:29] it's not an Earthly language
[1:05:33] it's a Heavenly language
[1:05:36] and if you don't think it's so just
[1:05:38] start trying to explain to different
[1:05:40] ones what you believe
[1:05:44] you might as well be speaking Greek
[1:05:49] amen now watch this Prophet Elisha
[1:05:54] 1954.
[1:05:59] I'm going to read just the highlighted
[1:06:01] portion for the sake of time
[1:06:04] our nations are polluted our dumb
[1:06:07] democracies are Torn to Pieces and broke
[1:06:09] up
[1:06:10] and are the kingdoms of the earth is to
[1:06:14] be Torn to Pieces
[1:06:16] but there's one Kingdom that we believe
[1:06:19] that is coming soon
[1:06:21] the Lord Jesus Christ is set up an
[1:06:23] everlasting Kingdom
[1:06:25] and all the nations of the world that
[1:06:28] Sade will live in that Kingdom that we
[1:06:30] want flag one nation One People speaking
[1:06:34] one language
[1:06:36] and that's a Heavenly language you like
[1:06:39] that
[1:06:40] listen it ain't gonna be English or
[1:06:42] German or French or Swedish it's a
[1:06:45] Heavenly language what Heavenly language
[1:06:48] does the Holy Ghost speak he speaks
[1:06:51] revelation
[1:06:54] the Oneness of unity
[1:06:57] they want them to speak one language he
[1:06:59] talks about Germany and Russia
[1:07:01] just like they did in Babylon
[1:07:05] they are one language and he wants all
[1:07:07] to speak one language they want them all
[1:07:09] to be you
[1:07:11] to be one United person
[1:07:14] but it will never take place under man's
[1:07:17] Dominion
[1:07:18] but I'll say this there's coming a time
[1:07:21] when all nations will be United together
[1:07:23] under one king
[1:07:25] and that will be Jesus Christ God's son
[1:07:29] and they'll speak one language
[1:07:31] there'll be one in heart and one in
[1:07:34] purpose you see good what God is doing
[1:07:36] he's giving this bride from down from
[1:07:40] the ages all of them he's speaking his
[1:07:44] Eternal Word which is a language
[1:07:48] oh yeah it's god making himself known
[1:07:51] it's sharing his mind
[1:07:54] he's sharing his understanding with you
[1:07:58] you Lord
[1:08:00] Hallelujah
[1:08:05] revelation
[1:08:07] of this man's message is making us all
[1:08:10] speak the same thing
[1:08:13] say what I said on those tapes
[1:08:17] I don't want your opinion
[1:08:20] I don't want you yeah I want revelation
[1:08:27] amen
[1:08:28] foreign
[1:08:33] ation to non-seed you might as well
[1:08:35] speak a foreign language
[1:08:38] talk about having a word birth
[1:08:41] you speak a foreign language
[1:08:43] talk to them about the voice of the
[1:08:45] seventh angel
[1:08:48] It's All Greek tomb
[1:08:50] foreign language they don't catch it
[1:08:53] but the moment that that elect seed
[1:08:55] begins to hear the word of God God's
[1:08:58] thought
[1:08:59] what is it God makes his word known to
[1:09:03] them you know what he's doing his voice
[1:09:05] his language
[1:09:07] and the Holy Ghost making it known to
[1:09:10] you what is it the language
[1:09:13] of God comes to you by God himself and
[1:09:17] he is The Interpreter of his own word
[1:09:29] here what hears thou Elijah
[1:09:32] the man wants before tried to build a
[1:09:35] tower to get away from the Earth
[1:09:37] and God just didn't give them any Unity
[1:09:41] I think men today are trying to build
[1:09:43] these towers
[1:09:46] to get over to the Moon
[1:09:49] they're setting Yonder now with all
[1:09:51] kinds of conferences with no Unity
[1:09:54] they can't even speak one another's
[1:09:56] language
[1:09:58] there's one language that we all ought
[1:10:01] to know
[1:10:02] that's the language of God
[1:10:07] about what I'm preaching
[1:10:10] it's a Heavenly like it's a Godly
[1:10:13] language
[1:10:15] there's one language you ought to know
[1:10:17] and that's the language of God God's
[1:10:19] love for one another and Brotherhood
[1:10:21] among men
[1:10:22] and when we learn that kind of a tower
[1:10:24] that kind of a language
[1:10:28] there'll be a tower let down from the
[1:10:30] heavens watch this
[1:10:32] that'll take us away to Glory
[1:10:36] that'll be Jacob's Ladder that God will
[1:10:40] let us climb up someday hallelujah what
[1:10:44] is it every rung goes higher from
[1:10:47] justification to sanctification to the
[1:10:50] restoration of the gifts to the adoption
[1:10:54] to the glory we once had with him in the
[1:10:57] beginning hallelujah what God is doing
[1:11:00] allowing you to climb Jacob's Ladder
[1:11:11] out of the abundance of the heart the
[1:11:14] Bible says that the mouth speaketh
[1:11:18] when you catch revelation of this
[1:11:20] message
[1:11:21] it causes you to speak God's language
[1:11:26] faith is God's language that the Holy
[1:11:29] Ghost Believers speak
[1:11:35] I had somebody wearing a mask the other
[1:11:37] day
[1:11:39] I don't know about you I don't only
[1:11:41] don't like wearing a mask but I can't
[1:11:45] understand the people that speak through
[1:11:47] the mouth
[1:11:49] foreign
[1:11:52] I don't speak mask
[1:11:57] anyway
[1:12:01] now in the sermon law watch this
[1:12:04] now it's strange thing
[1:12:07] that this so much thought of people they
[1:12:11] say well I'm weak my faith is not very
[1:12:14] much
[1:12:15] I'm not a very good Christian
[1:12:17] that's just what the devil wants you to
[1:12:20] say
[1:12:21] because you're just talking
[1:12:24] his language right there
[1:12:27] when you
[1:12:29] dealt and I believe that's the devil's
[1:12:32] language but when you have faith that's
[1:12:35] God's language
[1:12:40] must have never speak the devil's
[1:12:42] language
[1:12:44] let's sit here let's get rid of these
[1:12:46] negative thoughts whatsoever things are
[1:12:48] pure whatsoever Things Are Holy think on
[1:12:52] these things
[1:12:54] amen
[1:12:57] so if the devil's language
[1:13:00] is doubt and unbelief
[1:13:03] then faith is the language
[1:13:07] that the Holy Ghost is bringing to every
[1:13:10] believer
[1:13:13] he's a Divine interpreter of the word
[1:13:17] be certain of God
[1:13:20] and if you could only grasp that this
[1:13:22] afternoon that his goodness to that
[1:13:25] little woman now watch this
[1:13:27] finish or whatever she was last night
[1:13:30] to be sure that her faith would be
[1:13:32] recognized
[1:13:34] he called her
[1:13:36] in her own language
[1:13:41] yes now overseas many times
[1:13:44] we see that happens in foreign countries
[1:13:48] that I'll be standing speaking and I'll
[1:13:51] turn right back around and use my
[1:13:54] language and call the people in their
[1:13:56] names and everything
[1:13:58] just like it does here
[1:14:00] in their own native language
[1:14:04] That's What I Call Pentecost
[1:14:08] I believe it that's the Holy Spirit
[1:14:19] you like that let me read it again all
[1:14:22] right let's read it again I'll be
[1:14:24] standing speaking
[1:14:26] and I'll turn right back around and use
[1:14:28] my language
[1:14:30] and call the people in their names
[1:14:33] and everything just like it's done here
[1:14:36] in their own native language
[1:14:40] now he's speaking
[1:14:43] like they did on the day of Pentecost
[1:14:48] well that woman whether she was Finnish
[1:14:50] or whatever
[1:14:52] she's hearing it
[1:14:54] watch this watch this
[1:14:57] you talk about
[1:14:59] a Google translation
[1:15:03] when you speak now
[1:15:06] and you're under the blood
[1:15:09] God hears your voice
[1:15:13] but he said when it goes through the
[1:15:15] blood
[1:15:17] it changes and it becomes his voice
[1:15:23] so it's not you making intercession for
[1:15:26] yourself it's the oh my God my God help
[1:15:30] me it's the Holy Ghost inside of you
[1:15:33] making an intercession for you
[1:15:37] hallelujah it's a language
[1:15:40] do you know that moanings and groanings
[1:15:43] within yourself it's a holy spirit
[1:15:46] inside of you making intercession for
[1:15:50] you
[1:15:56] I hope you're enjoying this because I'm
[1:15:58] enjoying preaching it
[1:16:03] listen carefully
[1:16:06] now since the confounding of the
[1:16:08] languages in Babylon
[1:16:10] man has sought to be able to speak each
[1:16:12] to each other in one language
[1:16:16] so they're devising another Tower
[1:16:20] where that everyone can speak to one
[1:16:22] another
[1:16:24] it's a scientific man-made Tower of
[1:16:28] Babylon
[1:16:29] and any of you know
[1:16:32] that the computer is a language all on
[1:16:35] its own
[1:16:36] it's called a universal language they
[1:16:39] write applications they do this and a
[1:16:43] man in China
[1:16:45] his computer can can reach up and what
[1:16:51] link up with one in Russia
[1:16:53] and though they speak different
[1:16:55] languages and under these two computers
[1:16:59] by what is called a computer tower
[1:17:04] do you see a scientific Tower creating
[1:17:07] the world to come under one mind
[1:17:10] one consent
[1:17:12] perverting their minds
[1:17:15] getting them they go into the internet
[1:17:17] and these Souls talk to one another and
[1:17:20] it's all over the world it's going
[1:17:22] global
[1:17:25] where are they getting it from another
[1:17:28] Tower they're building
[1:17:32] just like it was in the days of nimrod
[1:17:35] modern day nimrods
[1:17:38] are again building a tower in the midst
[1:17:40] of mystery Babylon
[1:17:42] everyone's connected to it and causes
[1:17:45] them to come under the unity
[1:17:49] just a carnal
[1:17:51] in person for impersonation of what God
[1:17:54] is doing in the spirit
[1:17:57] they're scientific and educated Minds
[1:18:01] have built a system of one computer
[1:18:03] language
[1:18:05] call them it has caused them to call and
[1:18:08] come into a false Unity of the same mind
[1:18:13] and they say that that
[1:18:15] when you
[1:18:17] are hooked up linked up now I'm sorry
[1:18:20] I'm not a computer person
[1:18:22] thank God for that
[1:18:27] but when you are hooked up you're under
[1:18:30] the influence of the cloud
[1:18:35] but the bride
[1:18:38] has been linked up under a different
[1:18:40] cloud
[1:18:43] you like that
[1:18:45] a different cloud
[1:18:48] and when you come under there
[1:18:50] depending on how sensitized you are
[1:18:54] some of you only have one bar
[1:18:58] can you hear me now holy spirit talking
[1:19:00] can you hear me now
[1:19:06] you're not praying like you should
[1:19:07] you're not reading like you should
[1:19:09] you're not sensitized
[1:19:11] when you start praying all of a sudden
[1:19:13] it goes from one bar to two can can you
[1:19:16] hear me now yeah loud and clear buddy
[1:19:19] I got you
[1:19:20] somebody say I got you
[1:19:22] that's what the holy spirit's wanting to
[1:19:24] do with you
[1:19:26] sensitize yourself to the Holy Spirit
[1:19:31] somebody say I'm under the cloud
[1:19:33] amen which cloud
[1:19:37] that cloud the cloud okay
[1:19:41] the message is a pure language
[1:19:44] that has been restored back because God
[1:19:47] circumcised this message
[1:19:49] from all kinds of man's ideas
[1:19:51] denominational teaching Creeds and
[1:19:55] dogmas with the opening of the seals
[1:19:58] and how do you do it with a sharp
[1:20:01] two-edged sword
[1:20:03] amen
[1:20:06] you like yeah you like that
[1:20:09] we're gonna take it a little bit further
[1:20:11] is this okay
[1:20:12] now watch this in First Corinthians 14
[1:20:15] talking about languages
[1:20:17] and here it is gifts in the church
[1:20:20] follow it's verse 1
[1:20:22] St Corinthians 14.
[1:20:24] follow after charity and desire
[1:20:26] spiritual gifts
[1:20:28] but rather that you might prophesy now
[1:20:31] stop here for a moment because Paul said
[1:20:33] do all speak with tongues
[1:20:36] do all prophesy do all have the gifts of
[1:20:40] healing
[1:20:41] but he said God gives gifts to you
[1:20:44] severally as he will
[1:20:48] he said tongues is the least of the
[1:20:51] gifts and the one most easily
[1:20:54] impersonated
[1:20:56] see my tide time my tie
[1:20:59] told you that before first time went to
[1:21:01] a Pentecostal church and the guy told me
[1:21:03] just just Babble that's what he told me
[1:21:06] just babble and I yeah so he I I said I
[1:21:09] don't know how to babble he said see my
[1:21:11] tight time I die
[1:21:13] I said see my tie tie my tie he said say
[1:21:16] it faster Timothy
[1:21:19] Hallelujah here's another one that got
[1:21:21] it what a joke
[1:21:24] what a false Deception come on brother
[1:21:28] raise your hand just praise God thank
[1:21:30] God you got it say you got it you got it
[1:21:33] you got it I ain't got it
[1:21:35] and that caused me to backslide
[1:21:38] because when you sincerely by somebody
[1:21:41] telling you
[1:21:42] that that's it
[1:21:44] and when your expectations are not met
[1:21:47] and he doesn't give you the holy ghost
[1:21:49] or if you think that's the Holy Ghost
[1:21:52] you think there ain't much to it
[1:21:58] that's why don't ever let some preacher
[1:22:01] get you all wrapped up in some kind of
[1:22:03] emotion some kind of thing because you
[1:22:05] jumped shouted you spoke in tongues
[1:22:08] brother Branham said I've seen witches
[1:22:10] and wizards do the same thing drink
[1:22:13] blood out of a human skull and call on
[1:22:16] the devil
[1:22:18] God help us
[1:22:21] amen listen to me now
[1:22:25] verse 2 but he that speaketh in an
[1:22:27] unknown tongue
[1:22:29] speaking not into men but unto God for
[1:22:31] no man understandeth him how be it the
[1:22:34] spirit speaketh in Mysteries
[1:22:37] but he that prophesies speaketh on
[1:22:40] demand to edification exhortation to
[1:22:43] comfort
[1:22:44] he that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[1:22:47] edifieth himself let me just stop here
[1:22:49] for a moment
[1:22:50] because people have asked me brother Ron
[1:22:52] do you speak in tongues yes I do do I
[1:22:54] have a gift of tongues yes I do how
[1:22:56] often do I do it not that often but I'll
[1:22:58] tell you what we've been here and we've
[1:23:00] been having worship Services right here
[1:23:03] and I start speaking in tongues right
[1:23:05] here and I have to say that while I'm
[1:23:08] speaking in tongues I'm not doing it
[1:23:10] that it might be an interpretation
[1:23:13] I'm speaking unto God self edification
[1:23:17] I'll tell you what some of you need some
[1:23:19] of that right now
[1:23:24] yes I speak with tongues
[1:23:27] but I'm going to show you what the Bible
[1:23:29] says
[1:23:32] I would that you all speak with tongues
[1:23:35] but rather that you prophesied
[1:23:40] for greater is he that prophesieth
[1:23:42] then he that speak with tongues except
[1:23:45] he interpret
[1:23:47] that the church may receive edifying now
[1:23:50] brethren if I come unto you speaking
[1:23:52] with tongues what shall I profit you
[1:23:56] except I shall speak to you either by
[1:23:59] Revelation or by knowledge or by
[1:24:01] prophesying or by Doctrine
[1:24:05] then he goes and things with with uh
[1:24:08] without life-giving sound pipe harp I'm
[1:24:11] not going to go into that go to verse
[1:24:12] 11. therefore if I know not the meaning
[1:24:15] of The Voice
[1:24:18] I shall be unto him that speaketh up
[1:24:20] Barbarian
[1:24:22] and he that speaketh
[1:24:25] shall be a barbarian unto me
[1:24:29] even so
[1:24:31] for as much of your zealous of spiritual
[1:24:33] gifts seek that you meet
[1:24:35] Excel to the edifying of the church
[1:24:38] wherefore let him that speaketh in an
[1:24:40] unknown tongue pray that he might
[1:24:42] interpret
[1:24:46] for if I pray in an unknown tongue my
[1:24:48] spirit prayeth but my understanding is
[1:24:50] fruitless unfruitful
[1:24:54] First Corinthians 14 says verse 18. I
[1:24:57] thank my God I speak in tongues more
[1:24:59] than you all
[1:25:02] get into the church
[1:25:05] do you like that he's showing you yet in
[1:25:08] the church
[1:25:10] I had rather speak five words with my
[1:25:12] understanding
[1:25:14] that by my voice I might teach others
[1:25:16] also then ten thousand words in an
[1:25:21] unknown tongue
[1:25:23] Brethren be not children and
[1:25:25] understanding how be it in Malice be
[1:25:27] children but an understanding be men
[1:25:31] some look at talking in tongues is a
[1:25:35] sign of God's blessings and that we're
[1:25:37] that that is the Holy Ghost isn't that
[1:25:40] exactly what what the the
[1:25:44] false doctrine of Pentecost says false
[1:25:47] evidence
[1:25:49] and he said it was the genuine Holy
[1:25:51] Spirit on your spirit
[1:25:55] he said it is the Holy Spirit
[1:25:59] he said the jumping the shouting it's on
[1:26:01] your spirit doesn't go to the soul
[1:26:04] because many people do that
[1:26:07] and they do all of those Sensational
[1:26:09] things and he says and her soul just as
[1:26:12] black as night and on their way to hell
[1:26:16] don't base
[1:26:18] what you believe or your evidence of the
[1:26:21] Holy Ghost because of some emotional
[1:26:24] thing
[1:26:26] amen
[1:26:30] easiest to impersonate
[1:26:33] the Bible also says First Corinthians 14
[1:26:36] wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and
[1:26:39] forbid not to speak with tongues
[1:26:42] let all fun things be done decent and in
[1:26:45] order
[1:26:46] so we don't forbid to speak in tongues
[1:26:50] my wife has a genuine gift of tongues
[1:26:52] and she also has a genuine gift of
[1:26:55] interpretation of her own tongues this
[1:26:58] happens several times in her life
[1:27:01] in fact the first time shortly after
[1:27:03] we're married in Sandy excuse me for
[1:27:05] using you because you don't like it when
[1:27:07] I do
[1:27:11] we had been married just a few weeks and
[1:27:14] she was not in bed and I reached over
[1:27:15] and I thought where is she
[1:27:17] I heard some music in the front room
[1:27:21] I opened the door and when I went out
[1:27:23] there and she was on her knees and she
[1:27:25] had her hands in the air and she was
[1:27:27] singing in tongues
[1:27:30] see I don't have you ever heard someone
[1:27:32] sing in tongues
[1:27:34] she was singing in tongues now tongues
[1:27:38] is an actual tongue
[1:27:41] it's not stammering lips
[1:27:43] it's not bad
[1:27:49] though we understand and I'm not trying
[1:27:51] to impersonate something
[1:27:54] but it's an actual in fact you hear the
[1:27:57] enunciation
[1:27:58] you you hear it spoken
[1:28:01] and I had heard it often and she had
[1:28:03] heard it often
[1:28:05] and one day we were in the Flagstaff
[1:28:07] church and we had a man come from Israel
[1:28:10] and he spoke Hebrew and they asked him
[1:28:14] would you pray at the beginning of the
[1:28:16] service in Hebrew
[1:28:20] put his hands up he began to speak in
[1:28:23] the Hebrew tongue
[1:28:26] and chills when all over my body
[1:28:29] Sandy she got all stiff she looked at me
[1:28:33] we looked at one another and she said
[1:28:36] that's my tongue
[1:28:41] now saints of God there are tongues
[1:28:44] and I don't need you to raise your hand
[1:28:47] but I know that there are many of you in
[1:28:50] this congregation that have spoken
[1:28:52] tongues
[1:28:54] but we don't
[1:28:55] point to that and say that's the
[1:28:58] evidence thank God
[1:29:01] that I have spoken tongues thank God
[1:29:03] that he does it forbid not to speak in
[1:29:07] tongues
[1:29:08] but the prophet also said let everything
[1:29:11] be done decent
[1:29:13] and in order and when the prophet of God
[1:29:16] began to put the church in order it
[1:29:19] caused a split
[1:29:26] let me show you and they could what's
[1:29:28] called La Celia
[1:29:30] which is
[1:29:32] the gifts of tongues and it's actually
[1:29:34] because you have justification
[1:29:37] sanctification and you have the
[1:29:40] restoration of the gifts
[1:29:42] glosselia
[1:29:44] it's not just tongues but
[1:29:48] Pentecost has said it's the evidence
[1:29:51] that it's the Holy Ghost
[1:29:54] well there are more gifts of the Spirit
[1:29:57] than just speaking in tongues
[1:30:00] are we together on that let's be Bible
[1:30:03] believers
[1:30:04] now when the prophet of God began to put
[1:30:07] it in order and make people accountable
[1:30:12] is when they all got real shook
[1:30:16] now I'm going to show you here excuse me
[1:30:19] I'm going to take some time tonight I'm
[1:30:21] enjoying this and I don't want to have
[1:30:22] to wait until another couple Sundays it
[1:30:25] preaches to you
[1:30:27] go overtime tonight
[1:30:30] you're getting your money's worth
[1:30:31] tonight
[1:30:33] all right
[1:30:35] a lot easier in church age then there's
[1:30:38] all this talk about glossalea
[1:30:41] it's supposed to be the evidence of the
[1:30:43] baptism of Holy Ghost
[1:30:46] and people are thinking that we're in
[1:30:47] the midst of a great Revival Revival's
[1:30:50] over
[1:30:52] America's had her last chance in 1957.
[1:30:57] now the tongues are God's sign of
[1:31:01] impending disaster even as they were
[1:31:05] when they appeared on the wall of
[1:31:06] belshaser's feast
[1:31:10] he talks about Lord Lord heaven we've
[1:31:13] done many wonderful Works in thy name
[1:31:15] cast out devils and he said depart from
[1:31:17] me you workers of iniquity I never knew
[1:31:20] you Matthew 7.
[1:31:21] Jesus said they were workers of iniquity
[1:31:25] you get a man that can come and pray for
[1:31:27] the sick get oil blood appearing in the
[1:31:29] congregation prophecy coming forth and
[1:31:33] all manner of the supernatural
[1:31:35] and the people will gather around him
[1:31:37] and swear that he's of the Lord
[1:31:39] even though he's actually making a money
[1:31:41] racket of religion and living in sin
[1:31:45] the only answer they have is the
[1:31:47] absolutely unbiblical answer
[1:31:49] of well it gets results so it must be of
[1:31:53] God
[1:31:54] how terrible how actually poor is this
[1:31:57] age
[1:31:58] in the spirit of God and the poor
[1:32:01] poverty-stricken ones that don't even
[1:32:03] know it
[1:32:04] my
[1:32:06] the third poll
[1:32:07] is a separating pull
[1:32:11] Junior Jackson pulled away from Brother
[1:32:14] Branham because he set the church in
[1:32:16] order concerning tongues here it is
[1:32:18] questions and answers 64.
[1:32:22] I don't know I don't think my brother's
[1:32:24] here tonight
[1:32:26] but somebody made fun of somebody
[1:32:28] leaving the Tabernacle went down to
[1:32:31] brother Junior Jackson's for a church
[1:32:34] said they went down among the dead birds
[1:32:38] aren't you ashamed of a remark like that
[1:32:41] ever who you are if you're my kid here
[1:32:43] in Christ I'm ashamed of you
[1:32:46] don't do a thing like that Junior
[1:32:47] Jackson is my brother
[1:32:49] Don ruddle is my brother Don ruddle also
[1:32:52] split
[1:32:54] well the reason of it because when I set
[1:32:56] the church here in a certain order well
[1:32:59] I come back to see if I could get the
[1:33:01] manifestation of the gifts half of them
[1:33:04] pulled away
[1:33:06] look at that
[1:33:08] half of them pulled away from it
[1:33:10] because when you start to speak or
[1:33:13] preach or something it was getting to
[1:33:15] such a place you could hardly preach
[1:33:16] unless there was somebody spoken tongues
[1:33:18] somebody interpreting somebody given the
[1:33:20] interpreting half of it never even come
[1:33:22] to pass
[1:33:23] now brother Brahm said when uh tongues
[1:33:26] and interpretation is given that's a
[1:33:29] prophecy is that right
[1:33:31] he says to prophesy is to foretell a
[1:33:34] future event
[1:33:36] it is not repeating scripture
[1:33:38] it is not well wishing it is not saying
[1:33:41] what the word is said now let me give
[1:33:44] you an example of that all ye my people
[1:33:48] if you will hear my word if you will
[1:33:51] harden not your heart if you will seek
[1:33:54] me with all thy face if you will get on
[1:33:57] your knees and pray if thou will humble
[1:34:00] thyself before God will they not show
[1:34:02] you what my will is to you will I not
[1:34:06] pour out my spirit upon you and on and
[1:34:09] on people
[1:34:10] that's repeating scripture
[1:34:16] brother Ram said
[1:34:19] he said no it'll be something like don't
[1:34:21] go
[1:34:23] home tonight on I-10 because there's
[1:34:26] going to be a bad wreck
[1:34:28] and he says now we got one that speaks
[1:34:31] in tongues
[1:34:32] one that interprets it and you've got
[1:34:34] three Elders that judge it is that of
[1:34:37] God I want you to sign hey Jonathan you
[1:34:39] think that's of God here son my brother
[1:34:41] you think yeah okay you guys sign it
[1:34:44] you're Elders you thought it was of God
[1:34:46] and it don't come to pass then what
[1:34:48] oh oh
[1:34:51] my goodness he says not only the one
[1:34:54] that spoke in tongues the ones that
[1:34:56] interpreted but now the elders that
[1:34:59] wrote their name said you got a lion
[1:35:01] devil among you that said thus saith the
[1:35:03] Lord said this was the spirit of God and
[1:35:06] it won
[1:35:07] that's why brother Graham said half of
[1:35:09] them never even come to pass you know
[1:35:10] why because it's just reiterating
[1:35:14] do you see what I'm saying come on we
[1:35:16] are not we're not babes
[1:35:19] we are elders
[1:35:21] we have raised up we we come out of
[1:35:24] Pentecost we saw those things those
[1:35:27] Saints they're real they're genuine
[1:35:29] they're genuine gifts but when they put
[1:35:31] them in order
[1:35:33] that's why Paul said look I'd rather I
[1:35:36] speak them in five words of a known
[1:35:37] language than ten thousand words unknown
[1:35:40] tongue now watch this
[1:35:42] I told her Brendan there's Witnesses
[1:35:44] here that know this I said let it alone
[1:35:49] after a while we'll find out whether
[1:35:50] it's of God or not
[1:35:52] they cannot stand chastisement
[1:35:55] then it's a
[1:35:57] bastard child
[1:35:59] exactly what the Bible said and when the
[1:36:01] test my chest went come what happened
[1:36:04] did I tell you that long ago asked to
[1:36:07] pass here well what about this and that
[1:36:09] just let it along
[1:36:11] they're babes
[1:36:13] we can't judge it but watch when it
[1:36:15] really comes to pinned down to the word
[1:36:18] Junior Jackson has a right
[1:36:21] to disagree with that he wants his
[1:36:24] church the people wants to speak in
[1:36:26] tongues and things in the audience
[1:36:28] that's brother Jr's troubles
[1:36:33] that's up to him
[1:36:35] but Junior Jackson believes this message
[1:36:38] the same as any of the rest of us does
[1:36:41] he's one of us it's not a dirty bird to
[1:36:44] go out there tenure Jackson is a man of
[1:36:47] God that I love with all my heart and
[1:36:49] it's and it's not here tonight so I can
[1:36:51] really pour it on the way I want to
[1:36:57] next quote he's saying we are called
[1:36:59] unclean Birds because we go to Junior
[1:37:01] Jackson church sometimes
[1:37:03] he don't comply with the new church
[1:37:05] rules here at the church
[1:37:07] are we out of the perfect will to attend
[1:37:09] there at times no sir
[1:37:11] Junior Jackson be a man of God I've
[1:37:13] already explained it now we don't agree
[1:37:16] with the order of the church and I want
[1:37:17] to say that
[1:37:20] ministers are absolutely the worst when
[1:37:22] it comes to disagreeing with them
[1:37:25] because we're supposed to be able have
[1:37:27] you ever read the quote we can disagree
[1:37:30] bitterly as far as East is from West but
[1:37:33] when we get done we're still Brothers
[1:37:34] put your arm around no hey you're out
[1:37:37] disagree with me
[1:37:42] Hey listen brother Brigham said my wife
[1:37:44] and I disagree
[1:37:47] huh
[1:37:49] he says I like apple pie and you know
[1:37:52] she likes whatever and he likes to put
[1:37:54] calf slobbers on it and all of that hey
[1:37:57] come on
[1:37:59] You can disagree and I'll tell you and
[1:38:01] each one of you understand this you can
[1:38:03] disagree with one another bitterly
[1:38:06] but brother Branham said I would rather
[1:38:08] have a church where the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:11] bringing forth Godly brotherly love then
[1:38:14] all the gifts you have in the Bible
[1:38:17] so let me see you manifest the the love
[1:38:21] of God when somebody disagrees with you
[1:38:24] well brother God bless you I certainly
[1:38:27] don't agree with that you remember what
[1:38:29] those men did when they came to brother
[1:38:30] Brandon because we're going to lay hands
[1:38:32] on you because you you got all this
[1:38:34] false Doctrine we come here to help you
[1:38:37] because we disagree with your doctor he
[1:38:39] said well go ahead and pray for me they
[1:38:41] prayed for him and guess what God
[1:38:42] increased his revelation
[1:38:45] be quick too
[1:38:47] agree with them
[1:38:49] right so God gave him Revel God gave the
[1:38:52] prophet revelation
[1:38:54] and you know what they when they left
[1:38:55] they said well he sure has the spirit of
[1:38:57] Christ
[1:39:00] God help us to have the spirit of Christ
[1:39:03] instead of somebody disagree with you
[1:39:05] and you get all puffed up you got to get
[1:39:08] upset and stop that that's nonsense
[1:39:10] that's childish
[1:39:14] let's do what he said let's love one
[1:39:16] another
[1:39:17] he said one says he's coming on a white
[1:39:19] cloud the other says he's coming on a
[1:39:21] white horse who cares
[1:39:23] as long as we agree he's coming
[1:39:26] amen
[1:39:28] God help us
[1:39:33] he says we may not see things eye to eye
[1:39:36] but we stick together
[1:39:39] that's him but now watch this he's
[1:39:41] calling them brother
[1:39:43] and let's stick together but did they
[1:39:45] stick together with him
[1:39:47] no
[1:39:49] he Church ordered himself right out of
[1:39:53] the Holy Ghost
[1:39:55] where are they today
[1:40:00] okay now
[1:40:03] you see when he corrected the heir of
[1:40:05] the gifts operating incorrectly people
[1:40:07] broke away from the prophet
[1:40:09] and left the Tabernacle it was the sword
[1:40:12] of the spirit because the Bible says
[1:40:13] Hebrews 4 12. and I'm bringing this to a
[1:40:16] close hang on I'm going to go quickly
[1:40:18] kind of like that that you ever been at
[1:40:20] the mall and you put the penny out there
[1:40:22] and it goes
[1:40:25] it's gonna drop here in a second
[1:40:28] word of God is quick and powerful and
[1:40:31] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:40:34] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[1:40:37] between Soul and Spirit
[1:40:40] now three compartments of the human
[1:40:42] being Body Spirit soul
[1:40:46] and this sharp two-edged sword has the
[1:40:49] ability understand this
[1:40:52] to discern the difference whether you
[1:40:54] got the Holy Ghost on your spirit or on
[1:40:57] your soul
[1:41:00] what did it the word
[1:41:04] when the sword of the spirit was placed
[1:41:06] in the hand of the prophet
[1:41:08] he was up there in Sabino Canyon he
[1:41:11] thought it meant the end of his ministry
[1:41:14] he thought he was he was going off the
[1:41:17] scene he told Billy Paul take care of
[1:41:19] the kids and everything you know the his
[1:41:21] his testimony now I want to play a
[1:41:23] portion of tape for you I told these
[1:41:25] brothers to get it ready are you ready
[1:41:27] very good this is on the sermon trying
[1:41:30] to do goddess servants without it being
[1:41:33] God's Will from paragraph 46 to
[1:41:37] paragraph
[1:41:38] 59 now just let it play Brethren please
[1:41:41] turn up the sound so everybody hears it
[1:41:50] the Phoenix meeting remember I preached
[1:41:52] the sermon sirs what time is it remember
[1:41:54] that I said I seen that I said before it
[1:41:57] comes to pass remember thus saith the
[1:42:00] Lord
[1:42:01] something's going to happen you probably
[1:42:03] got to take your library and take down
[1:42:05] and there I said you remember now the
[1:42:08] visions that never fail
[1:42:09] something's going to happen remember
[1:42:12] and
[1:42:14] a few days after that I was getting
[1:42:16] nervous and I thought what I just I'll
[1:42:18] go to die I hope it's quick so I can get
[1:42:21] over it I don't want to linger
[1:42:22] one more of your lord said go up the
[1:42:24] topic to be in your Canyon I was up
[1:42:25] there holding up my hands praying
[1:42:28] I felt something spanked my hand it was
[1:42:30] a sword now you can just imagine how
[1:42:33] you'd feel standing there by yourself
[1:42:34] and here's a knife in your hand about
[1:42:36] that long
[1:42:37] I pulled it down and looked at it it's
[1:42:39] just nice when I'm now I'm scared of a
[1:42:42] knife anyhow and it had a it had a a
[1:42:44] metal something like one of these knives
[1:42:46] like a hot metal or something real sharp
[1:42:49] Panera had a sheath around it here where
[1:42:53] the duelers used to keep cutting one
[1:42:55] another's hands and it had a pearl in
[1:42:58] the handle here just sit my hand exactly
[1:43:02] I rubbed my face and looked back
[1:43:05] right on that same spot the other day I
[1:43:07] saw a little white dove come down I'll
[1:43:09] tell you about that later
[1:43:11] and uh I was
[1:43:14] holding that in my hand on all that
[1:43:15] strange now Lord I am I losing my mind
[1:43:19] there's no one here I'm miles from
[1:43:22] anybody and here is the sword I had my
[1:43:25] hand up and where did it come from
[1:43:29] I thought that's the strangest thing out
[1:43:31] of here it's a store
[1:43:35] I said there's nobody here standing here
[1:43:37] I'm up on top of these rocks come on top
[1:43:39] of the mountain
[1:43:40] you couldn't even see Tucson from there
[1:43:43] it's a far down although now that's a
[1:43:44] strange thing
[1:43:46] that's got to be in this vicinity
[1:43:48] somewhere somebody that could create and
[1:43:51] make a sword and put it in my hand
[1:43:54] watch this I said it could only be the
[1:43:57] very God to create a ram
[1:44:00] for Abraham
[1:44:03] to create those squirrels
[1:44:06] now to here is the material three
[1:44:09] different kinds of material in it and
[1:44:11] I'm holding it in my hand just as real
[1:44:13] as anything else I could hold in my hand
[1:44:15] I Heard a Voice that that's the king
[1:44:17] sword I don't know where does that come
[1:44:19] from
[1:44:20] Rock somewhere
[1:44:23] and I held it my hand like that I said a
[1:44:26] king so
[1:44:28] uh looked around and the sword was gone
[1:44:32] and I said a king sword that's the the
[1:44:36] Knight was sort of distorted I think
[1:44:38] that's right the army or some way the
[1:44:39] unite with it you know and I said well
[1:44:41] that's what that was probably far it
[1:44:43] means that maybe I'm to lay hands upon
[1:44:45] ministers or something like that to make
[1:44:47] them Minister and then uh a boy spoke
[1:44:51] back and said the king's sword not a
[1:44:54] king the king
[1:44:58] although now
[1:45:00] um either beside myself
[1:45:02] my mind is flipped or there's something
[1:45:05] taking place did somebody stand around
[1:45:07] here to buy me
[1:45:08] and brethren
[1:45:10] these things are true I don't I don't
[1:45:13] know how to tell you you've always seen
[1:45:15] it always happen that way
[1:45:17] and it's a I couldn't understand so it's
[1:45:20] the strangest feeling
[1:45:22] uh there and I thought now every who
[1:45:24] that is that talks to me all my life
[1:45:26] since a little bitty baby boy just
[1:45:28] standing right here and I can't steam at
[1:45:30] all
[1:45:31] I said the king's sword that would be
[1:45:35] God is the king
[1:45:37] and what is the sword the word word
[1:45:41] been placed in your hands so don't fear
[1:45:44] of death it's your ministry
[1:45:47] oh my God down off that mountain I only
[1:45:49] crying screaming the top of my voice
[1:45:51] jumping over rocks
[1:45:53] I went down told my wife I said I'm not
[1:45:55] gonna die I'm not gonna die it's it's my
[1:45:58] Menace I told her to get with Billy Paul
[1:46:00] here take the children I said I don't
[1:46:02] have anything but the church will see
[1:46:04] that you all don't go hungry and things
[1:46:06] and I'll meet you across the border and
[1:46:08] uh and so I said no I'm not going to die
[1:46:10] it's something about my ministry that's
[1:46:12] good right here that's good right there
[1:46:14] now musicians go ahead and you'll come
[1:46:16] I'm bringing this to her clothes
[1:46:18] you see what was it this is that third
[1:46:21] pool
[1:46:23] what is it the word revealed
[1:46:27] amen what is it the sword the word of
[1:46:29] God has now been placed in his hand
[1:46:31] and now he comes and he begins to show
[1:46:34] and this this word now divides asunder
[1:46:38] between spirit and soul
[1:46:44] and they can't stand the correction of
[1:46:46] the word because he said it in order
[1:46:50] are you with me now
[1:46:52] now the deacons started fighting for
[1:46:54] brother Branham
[1:46:56] and said those guys are nothing but a
[1:46:59] bunch of dead birds and he said now if
[1:47:00] you're my seed in Christ if you're one
[1:47:03] of my children shame on you
[1:47:06] he said now if they want to have that in
[1:47:09] their church that's up to them that's
[1:47:11] their trouble
[1:47:13] and I say the same way today
[1:47:15] we're not you know what creates a lot of
[1:47:18] confusion to people today because
[1:47:20] they're looking at all the different
[1:47:22] churches and the way they preach in the
[1:47:24] way that uh they worship and everything
[1:47:27] and one's got to go this way and one's
[1:47:30] got to go that way well Hey listen I I'm
[1:47:33] talking about the responsibility I have
[1:47:35] right here
[1:47:37] and listen I realize we ain't the
[1:47:39] shoutness we ain't the prettiest we
[1:47:41] ain't the dancingest
[1:47:43] huh but you guys are stable
[1:47:46] you're solid
[1:47:48] you're right here and I love that and
[1:47:52] I'm not afraid to match us with anyone
[1:47:54] else regardless of what they're doing I
[1:47:58] say God sovereignly is doing things in
[1:48:02] every church let them do what they want
[1:48:05] to do let's follow God in the way that
[1:48:08] God shows us can we say Amen to that
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:13] Nathan and Cora
[1:48:15] became more spiritual than Moses did
[1:48:18] they not
[1:48:19] oh Moses takes too much Authority are we
[1:48:22] not all spiritual
[1:48:24] and if God causes separation God's once
[1:48:27] said separate yourself Moses
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:30] the religious Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:48:33] thought they were more spiritual than
[1:48:35] Christ
[1:48:37] but God caused his separation among the
[1:48:39] group
[1:48:41] the 70 elders became offended when
[1:48:44] Christ entered his third pool
[1:48:46] except you eat my flesh and drink they
[1:48:48] said this hard saying who can hear it
[1:48:51] the Bible says in many of his disciples
[1:48:54] walked no more with him
[1:48:56] Saint John 6 6 6 mark of the beast to
[1:49:00] refuse to walk in the light of the word
[1:49:03] takes the mark of the beast
[1:49:06] the third poll is the word revealed
[1:49:09] it is the revelation of the word to you
[1:49:12] personally
[1:49:13] what is the language the pure language
[1:49:15] that God is using right now it's a
[1:49:18] Heavenly language
[1:49:20] it's a holy ghost language because the
[1:49:23] Holy Ghost speaks the revelation of the
[1:49:26] word to you and you understand it
[1:49:31] it's the language
[1:49:33] that I want all of you to have the ear
[1:49:36] to hear
[1:49:40] you like that
[1:49:42] God bless you this evening let's Stand
[1:49:44] Together
[1:49:45] amen some of you
[1:49:49] might have to take this tape and listen
[1:49:51] to it again
[1:49:54] go and read these quotes and go slowly
[1:50:00] but on the day of Pentecost when the
[1:50:02] penny when the Holy Ghost was fully come
[1:50:04] they all began to speak
[1:50:07] as the spirit gave them utterance
[1:50:11] was it a language
[1:50:15] and then everybody that was there I
[1:50:17] think there's 15 different nationalities
[1:50:19] we read them
[1:50:21] and they all said how is it that these
[1:50:24] are all galileans yet we hear them speak
[1:50:27] the great wonderful works of God in the
[1:50:30] language we're in we were born
[1:50:33] [Music]
[1:50:36] an unknown tongue
[1:50:38] they were glorifying God they began to
[1:50:41] worship God and the Holy Ghost gave them
[1:50:45] utterance and they were speaking a
[1:50:48] language
[1:50:53] it was revealed to them and they were
[1:50:55] worshiping God and all those people said
[1:50:58] these people are drunk on new wine or on
[1:51:02] wine he said these are
[1:51:04] not drunk as you suppose
[1:51:07] but he said they are drunk
[1:51:11] brother Bram said what was it that they
[1:51:14] were drunk on on that morning
[1:51:16] he said it was the Holy Ghost
[1:51:20] amen
[1:51:21] so when you think about a Heavenly
[1:51:24] language and coming under one language
[1:51:27] then understand that the computer is
[1:51:30] being used right now with the tower to
[1:51:31] speak one language to get all of them
[1:51:34] through YouTube Instagram Facebook all
[1:51:37] of this stuff for everybody to do you
[1:51:40] know that if you speak around your iPad
[1:51:42] or your cell phone and you say something
[1:51:45] I'm thinking about buying a hot tub
[1:51:47] guess what kind of uh uh commercials
[1:51:49] come up on your huh
[1:51:52] oh there's a new hot tub come out you
[1:51:55] never even researched it that thing's
[1:51:57] listening to you
[1:52:02] have any of you had your your
[1:52:05] cell phone down somewhere and all of a
[1:52:07] sudden Siri or something starts talking
[1:52:09] to you
[1:52:10] it's freaky
[1:52:13] my wife and I whoa what is that
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:21] you see we're we're in a realm right now
[1:52:24] saints of God where science science
[1:52:28] breaking into God's Great Laboratory
[1:52:32] and just like everything is getting
[1:52:34] voice activated
[1:52:36] it is replicating what God is doing
[1:52:39] because when you heard the message of
[1:52:41] the hour as it was in the Book of
[1:52:44] Genesis and God said and he activated
[1:52:46] with his voice is he not doing the same
[1:52:49] thing but in the days of the voice of
[1:52:52] the seventh angel when he should speak
[1:52:54] his language
[1:52:56] guess what when you heard it you took
[1:52:58] life Hallelujah
[1:53:01] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:53:04] amen somebody give God praise tonight
[1:53:06] amen
[1:53:09] amen
[1:53:11] hallelujah
[1:53:13] amen heavenly father I thank you
[1:53:16] for the goodness of God in our lives
[1:53:18] with mostly I thank you for the Holy
[1:53:20] Ghost
[1:53:21] s which speaks to us the revelation of
[1:53:24] God and faith is that language that
[1:53:27] every believer has got to speak because
[1:53:30] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:53:33] God
[1:53:35] and though those that were in the first
[1:53:37] Exodus heard the ministry of Moses but
[1:53:41] seeing what they had heard was not mixed
[1:53:43] with faith and were overthrown in the
[1:53:46] wilderness
[1:53:47] father I pray o God that you will allow
[1:53:49] us every time we come to church may we
[1:53:54] have what we hear be mixed with faith
[1:53:58] and may that Faith cause us
[1:54:01] to get into action
[1:54:03] I thank you and I praise you and I ask
[1:54:06] that you will bless
[1:54:08] this sermon that we have spoke I pray it
[1:54:11] was a blessing to them it blessed me
