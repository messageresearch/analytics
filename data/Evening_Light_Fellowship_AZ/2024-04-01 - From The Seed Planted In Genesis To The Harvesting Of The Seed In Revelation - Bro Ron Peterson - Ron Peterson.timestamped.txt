[31:14] hallelujah good morning I was thinking
[31:16] about the words of this song
[31:20] and I was told a story one
[31:24] time that they searched all over the
[31:27] world to find the uh the greatest
[31:29] scholar of religion right they found
[31:32] this guy and supposedly he's supposed to
[31:34] know it
[31:35] all and they said they asked him a
[31:37] question well what about
[31:39] Christianity of all the religions youve
[31:42] studied what's your thoughts about
[31:43] Christianity he goes well he goes the
[31:46] obvious fact there's an empty tomb amen
[31:50] he said but greater than that he said is
[31:53] that the Living God they serve
[31:59] chooses and I thought this was the
[32:01] profound part of this he
[32:03] chooses to live inside the
[32:11] worshiper he
[32:14] chooses to live inside the worshipper
[32:19] Hallelujah I tell you ain't not another
[32:21] religion out there's got a God that does
[32:25] that not another one
[32:28] can say that can testify that my God
[32:31] lives in
[32:34] me they placed him in a borrow
[32:40] Tomb at the ending of that
[32:47] day they watched the soldiers roll the
[32:50] stone oh think about it and then they
[32:54] sadly
[32:56] walked
[33:00] but
[33:00] suddenly within their broken
[33:05] hearts echoed the
[33:08] words they heard him
[33:13] say don't weep for
[33:17] me I'll live
[33:20] again on
[33:22] Resurrection

[33:53] victory at breaking of the Dawn
[34:00] they went running to the tomb but he was
[34:07] gone Mary cried and
[34:10] said My Savior Lives on
[34:16] Resurrection
[34:18] MN now listen to these words
[34:21] [Music]
[34:23] here they walked along beside of him
[34:28] [Music]
[34:29] but they did not
[34:33] believe feel this moment right
[34:37] here but he sat with him and broke the
[34:42] bread and then their eyes were made to
[34:46] [Applause]
[34:51] see and as they watched him taken from
[34:56] their side here's the testimony the two
[35:00] men robed in white said like he are
[35:07] sins he'll come again on
[35:12] Resurrection mourn aren't you looking
[35:15] for that amen hallelujah for

[41:30] appreciate our song specials
[41:56] today
[41:58] just two
[42:12] [Music]
[42:26] second
[42:31] [Music]
[42:33] the gates and doors are B and all the
[42:37] windows fastened
[42:39] down I spent the night in
[42:42] sleeplessness and Rose at every
[42:46] sound half in Hopeless
[42:49] sorrow half in fear the
[42:52] day would find the soldiers crashing
[42:56] through
[42:57] [Music]
[42:58] to drag us all
[43:00] [Music]
[43:06] away then just before the sunrise I
[43:10] heard something at the
[43:13] wall the gate began to
[43:16] Rattle and a voice began to
[43:19] call I hurry to the
[43:23] window and look down to the street
[43:27] expecting swords and
[43:31] torches and the sound of soldiers
[43:36] [Music]
[43:39] feet but there was no one there but Mary
[43:44] so I went down to let her
[43:46] in John stood there beside me as she
[43:51] told us where she'd been she said they
[43:55] moved him in the night and none of us
[43:58] knows
[44:01] where oh the stones been rolled away and
[44:04] now his body isn't
[44:09] there so we both ran towards the garden
[44:13] and then John ran on
[44:16] ahead we found the stone in empty tomb
[44:20] just the way that Mary said but the
[44:24] winding sheet they wrapped him in was
[44:27] just an empty
[44:31] shell and how and where they'd taken him
[44:35] was more than I could
[44:39] tell something strange had happened
[44:42] there but what I did not
[44:46] know John believed a miracle but I just
[44:51] turned to go circumstan and
[44:55] speculation it couldn't lift me very
[44:59] high cuz I'd seen them crucify
[45:04] him and then I watched him
[45:09] die back inside the house again the
[45:13] guilt and anguish
[45:15] came everything I'd promised him just
[45:19] added to my
[45:21] shame but at last it came to choices I
[45:25] denied I knew his
[45:29] name and even if he was
[45:34] alive it would never be the
[45:37] [Music]
[45:42] same oh but suddenly the air was filled
[45:46] with a strange and sweet
[45:48] perfume and light that came from
[45:51] everywhere drove Shadows from the room
[45:55] and then Jesus search before me with his
[45:58] arms held open
[46:02] wide and I fell down on my
[46:05] knees and I clung to him and
[46:11] [Music]
[46:13] cried and he raised me to my feet and as
[46:17] I looked into his
[46:20] eyes love was shining out from him like
[46:24] sunlight from the sky and guilt and my
[46:29] confusion disappeared in sweet
[46:32] release and every fear I'd ever
[46:36] had just melted into
[46:45] peace alive alive he's alive he's alive

[51:52] lovely wedding with um brother Nicholas
[51:55] sister Bey Rose and uh certainly had a a
[52:00] lovely time there and um I don't know if
[52:03] you all are aware but when brother Neil
[52:06] mder was going through the issues he was
[52:10] going
[52:11] through and um they said that he
[52:15] probably would not
[52:17] live and she was an ICU nurse on the
[52:21] same floor that he was at and she came
[52:24] by and told him she said brother Neil
[52:27] you have to be alive to be at my wedding
[52:31] to sit on the front
[52:35] row he fulfilled that prophecy on Friday
[52:41] Hall
[52:47] amen and then you know he had his feet
[52:51] amputated portions of his fingers and
[52:55] everything and he he was my right-hand
[52:58] man in the sense that he came here
[53:01] before every service Turned the Lights
[53:03] On music on open my door turn my office
[53:07] uh light on Etc and then this happened
[53:11] and then the brothers had to scramble
[53:14] and I'd come in and nothing was on and
[53:17] lights weren't you know
[53:19] uh I told him I said I sure miss you
[53:22] brother Neil he he said I'll be there
[53:24] brother Ron he said one day will walk
[53:27] through your office under my own power
[53:31] and he says without a cane and without a
[53:34] walker and he says and I'll come greet
[53:36] you he did that this
[53:39] [Applause]
[53:47] morning amen two prophecies fulfilled
[53:50] right there right there amen I love the
[53:53] Lord with all my heart I've been
[53:55] studying now just before and musicians
[53:58] you can go ahead and be seated thank you
[53:59] God bless you guys cuz I'm going to take
[54:02] my time here a little bit
[54:06] and
[54:08] yeah you all know those of you that's
[54:11] been here but are visitors they haven't
[54:13] and they don't perhaps know what I've
[54:16] been speaking on but I've been studying
[54:19] on the abstract title
[54:21] deed I've been studying
[54:24] on the um seven sealed book of
[54:28] redemption yes we've been looking at
[54:31] this uh book that Adam lost which was
[54:35] the title deed of redemption and
[54:38] everything that he lost and how that
[54:42] Humanity was without
[54:44] hope and but we know that God has a plan
[54:49] amen when that fell in the Garden of
[54:53] Eden and uh at Adam lost all his
[54:57] inheritance and they were cast out they
[55:00] lost position they lost their place they
[55:03] lost power that sort of thing but God
[55:06] who's rich in Mercy knows exactly what
[55:08] to do to bring him back why he's Jehovah
[55:11] Gyra he's a God that provides for all
[55:14] our our needs well in studying that it
[55:18] came back into to blend in with the
[55:23] story of redemption of Naomi Ruth and
[55:29] Boaz and so today it's going to be a
[55:33] little bit different of an Easter
[55:36] Service you'll have to wait and see what
[55:39] my title is and the direction I'm going
[55:43] now we certainly thank God for the
[55:45] resurrection amen we thank God there's
[55:48] an empty tomb in
[55:50] Jerusalem all that Pontius pilot and
[55:53] those Heretics in that day that
[55:56] crucified him all they had to do was
[55:58] just keep him there for three
[56:01] days and they would end that whole story
[56:03] but they couldn't that's right they set
[56:06] a guard over it sealed the tomb but he
[56:13] unseals breaks the seals breaks it open
[56:17] why seek ye the living among the
[56:20] dead amen so we thank God for that but
[56:24] our Prophet came in here and and taught
[56:26] us a few other things which I wish to
[56:29] launch out into this morning it may be a
[56:33] little bit different than perhaps what
[56:35] you thought of and uh normally Easter
[56:39] Service is around the resurrection and
[56:42] he lives and everything but actually we
[56:43] celebrate that every
[56:45] Sunday every Sunday it's not just a day
[56:49] of the year and uh that you know and we
[56:53] know uh according to what the prophet of
[56:55] God said and he said Christmas and
[56:57] Easter they're pagan
[57:00] holidays he says have nothing to do with
[57:02] them he said you ought to be ashamed he
[57:04] said to to do and then I don't know if
[57:07] any of you saw on uh um some of the
[57:10] internet there where Joe Biden has uh uh
[57:14] taken and just desecrated even what
[57:17] little bit of Christianity was left and
[57:21] they want no religious symbols no
[57:23] crosses no nothing and he's made it a
[57:26] a a day for the transgenders or
[57:29] something like that and I thought whoa
[57:31] you know what what we do is we're seeing
[57:33] that mystery Babylon coming back and
[57:37] taking everything about God and trying
[57:40] to just defile it all but there is a
[57:43] people hallelujah hallelujah there is a
[57:46] message that has been proclaimed that
[57:49] they know better that's right it ain't
[57:51] an Easter egg it ain't Santa Claus it
[57:54] ain't all this nonsense that the world
[57:56] Mega does on but we thank God for what
[58:00] he has done in this last
[58:03] age now um here we are just for a moment
[58:08] before I launch out into my
[58:11] sermon we are in a time of the changing
[58:13] of
[58:15] dispensations everything is pointing to
[58:18] it prophet of God said Israel is God's
[58:22] time piece he said I want you to look at
[58:25] is Israel and he says that's God's
[58:28] calendar he said watch what they're
[58:31] doing and you'll begin to see the time
[58:33] that you're living
[58:35] in and if you have noticed that they are
[58:39] this is the time of the red
[58:42] heer first time in 2,000
[58:45] years that they
[58:47] are they're killing the red heer why
[58:50] according to the levitical law and you
[58:53] all know that the temple was destroyed
[58:55] it's
[58:56] Etc and before they can return back to
[59:00] Temple worship they've got to sacrifice
[59:02] the red
[59:04] hepher and uh so they'll take the ashes
[59:08] of it and even brother Brenham says in
[59:12] the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit
[59:16] to Daniel he says he says now watch they
[59:19] are now a nation and he says uh is that
[59:24] right he says but they have not return
[59:26] to Temple worship
[59:28] yet he says and they will establish the
[59:32] temple worship and when they do the
[59:34] church will be
[59:36] gone how close are we now you you say
[59:40] does it have to be the rebuilding of the
[59:42] temple watch this brother Brenham also
[59:45] says when Abraham built an altar an
[59:48] altar is a place of
[59:50] worship and all they have to do is start
[59:54] their worship at the altar after they've
[59:58] sacrificed the red hepher and the red
[1:00:01] hepher signifies a Waters of
[1:00:05] Separation now there is anti-Semitism
[1:00:09] happening all over the world against
[1:00:13] Israel and it's prophesied in this last
[1:00:16] day that we know that they'll do that
[1:00:19] they'll turn against
[1:00:21] Israel but not only Israel but
[1:00:24] Christianity
[1:00:26] amen after the bride is gone there is
[1:00:30] going to be a time of Great
[1:00:33] Tribulation and there's going to be the
[1:00:36] killing of the
[1:00:38] 144,000 of the Jews 12,000 from every of
[1:00:42] the 12
[1:00:43] tribes and he said the foolish
[1:00:48] virgin amen so we're on the brink of
[1:00:52] something great and terrible
[1:00:57] because the Bible says that his coming
[1:00:59] is as a great and terrible
[1:01:01] day
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:06] and
[1:01:09] uh also to make you
[1:01:12] aware that during this time of the red
[1:01:16] heer and then on April the eth there is
[1:01:20] a um an
[1:01:24] eclipse the Bible say says that God will
[1:01:26] show the signs in the heavens before it
[1:01:30] happens on Earth he says the Sun the
[1:01:33] moon all these things are for times and
[1:01:37] Seasons the word season actually in
[1:01:39] Hebrew means feast day so it's a time of
[1:01:43] feast day we know the seven feasts of
[1:01:46] Jehovah
[1:01:47] Etc and uh so the enemy likes to come in
[1:01:51] here and try to uh destroy everything
[1:01:56] that is Holy unto
[1:01:59] God so these things that are
[1:02:03] happening the whole internet right now
[1:02:06] is a buzz between the red hefer and
[1:02:10] April the e8th and they're all nervous
[1:02:13] and Muslims are getting all excited
[1:02:15] because they're afraid that the mosque
[1:02:17] of Omar and the Dome of the Rocks going
[1:02:19] to be tore down and all this in the
[1:02:21] whole world and and and so but you know
[1:02:24] what nevertheless God God's word will be
[1:02:27] fulfilled Hallelujah now we don't have
[1:02:29] to see those things in order to get
[1:02:32] ready we've been getting ready for years
[1:02:35] that's right the bride has made herself
[1:02:37] ready she's been quickened by a
[1:02:41] messenger amen we've had Angel
[1:02:44] visitations that's made us aware of the
[1:02:47] day and the hour in which we're living
[1:02:49] that's right amen and brother brandham
[1:02:52] says now watch this he says Israel when
[1:02:55] it became
[1:02:56] ation he says the very hour that the
[1:03:01] Pan-American chart that Israel was
[1:03:04] declared a nation for the first time in
[1:03:07] over 2,000
[1:03:08] years since they had been scattered not
[1:03:11] of people it was the very same
[1:03:16] hour exactly to the hour that the angel
[1:03:19] of the Lord met me up yonder and sent me
[1:03:22] with this
[1:03:24] gospel the very same thing May the
[1:03:27] 7th
[1:03:31] 1946
[1:03:33] now he says there's another thing that
[1:03:36] gives me to know it's restoring the
[1:03:38] hearts of the children back to the
[1:03:41] fathers see it's the message of Malachi
[1:03:44] 4
[1:03:46] amen we're seeing what God has been
[1:03:50] doing we see it in types and
[1:03:52] shadows but the reason that we are here
[1:03:55] and we go to of this church is because
[1:03:57] we are
[1:03:59] products of an evening light message
[1:04:02] amen we Fellowship around that word of
[1:04:05] this hour we're not ashamed of it that's
[1:04:09] right God bless you let's all stand I'd
[1:04:10] like you to turn with me into the Old
[1:04:13] Testament book of Deuteronomy chapter
[1:04:16] 29 verse
[1:04:18] 29 so Deuteronomy
[1:04:21] 2929 then we'll go to Daniel chap 12
[1:04:26] then we'll go to Ruth chapter
[1:04:33] 2
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:36] Deuteronomy CH 29: 29 the secret things
[1:04:40] belong unto the Lord Our
[1:04:44] God but those things which are revealed
[1:04:47] belong unto us and to our children
[1:04:50] forever somebody say Amen to that
[1:04:53] amen so secret things belong to God but
[1:04:56] guess what he does he Reveals His
[1:04:59] secrets to the servants the
[1:05:03] prophets that we may do all the words of
[1:05:07] this law secret things belong unto God
[1:05:10] but those things which are real revealed
[1:05:12] belong to us somebody say that's me
[1:05:15] that's me amen turn with me to Daniel
[1:05:19] chapter 12 verses
[1:05:24] 1-4
[1:05:27] and at that time shall Michael stand up
[1:05:30] that great Prince which standeth for the
[1:05:33] children of thy people and there shall
[1:05:35] be a time of trouble such as never was
[1:05:38] since there was a nation even to the
[1:05:40] same
[1:05:42] time and at that time thy people shall
[1:05:45] be delivered everyone that shall be
[1:05:48] found written in the book Hallelujah and
[1:05:52] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[1:05:54] the Earth shall awake some to
[1:05:56] everlasting life and some to shame and
[1:05:59] everlasting
[1:06:01] contempt and they that be wise shall
[1:06:04] shine as the brightness of the firmament
[1:06:07] and they shall turn many to
[1:06:10] righteousness as the Stars forever and
[1:06:14] ever amen but thou oh Daniel shut up the
[1:06:19] words and seal the book even to the time
[1:06:23] of the end many shall run to and fro and
[1:06:27] knowledge shall be increased turn with
[1:06:30] me now back to the Book of
[1:06:36] Ruth and from here we'll launch out into
[1:06:39] our
[1:06:45] sermon and I gave them only verse one of
[1:06:49] Ruth two but we're going to read down to
[1:06:53] verse three also and Naomi had a Kinsman
[1:06:57] of her
[1:06:59] husbands a mighty man of wealth of the
[1:07:02] family of
[1:07:04] immc and his name was
[1:07:13] Boaz you'll have to excuse me for the
[1:07:16] past two or three
[1:07:19] days I have been overcome and wept in my
[1:07:25] stud
[1:07:26] study in seeing
[1:07:30] this and Ruth the Mobius said unto
[1:07:36] Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and
[1:07:39] glean ears of corn after him whose sight
[1:07:43] I shall find
[1:07:45] Grace and she said unto her go my
[1:07:50] daughter and she went and came and
[1:07:52] gleaned in the
[1:07:54] field after the
[1:07:56] Reapers and her hap very unusual
[1:08:01] word and her hap we might say her happen
[1:08:06] stance we might say her
[1:08:12] chance was to light on a part of the
[1:08:16] field belonging to Boaz do you think
[1:08:19] that's coincidence
[1:08:23] no who was of the Kindred of immc may
[1:08:28] God add the blessing to his word you all
[1:08:30] may be seated this morning in the
[1:08:32] presence of the
[1:08:38] Lord I would like to title this sermon
[1:08:42] this
[1:08:43] morning from the seed planted in
[1:08:47] Genesis to the harvesting of the seed in
[1:08:54] Revelation
[1:08:57] I want to take a subject this morning
[1:09:00] from Mount Calvary to mount
[1:09:03] Sunset the full
[1:09:06] picture of
[1:09:11] redemption brother Brenham says in the
[1:09:14] sermon Gabriel's instruction to Daniel
[1:09:16] now our Kinsman has handed the seven
[1:09:19] sealed book of redemption from the
[1:09:21] original
[1:09:24] owner we find out who the original owner
[1:09:27] was God himself and God came down and
[1:09:31] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:09:33] him that sat upon the throne excuse me
[1:09:36] and the lamb came down and took the book
[1:09:39] who was the lamb the
[1:09:41] Redeemer our kinsman redeemer the
[1:09:44] Kinsman to the
[1:09:45] church who come and redeemed Israel now
[1:09:50] for just a short time this morning if I
[1:09:54] could have
[1:09:55] your undivided
[1:09:57] attention as I go into this seven seal
[1:10:02] book of
[1:10:03] redemption and the story of
[1:10:06] Boaz and
[1:10:10] Ruth brother Brenham uses words such as
[1:10:14] the abstract title
[1:10:17] deed he says and all of those who were
[1:10:21] ordained to eternal life were names
[1:10:24] written
[1:10:25] in the book in fact Jesus told his
[1:10:28] disciples don't Rejoice that demons are
[1:10:31] subject to you but rather Rejoice that
[1:10:35] your names are written Hallelujah in the
[1:10:39] book
[1:10:45] Hallelujah so the book then is a
[1:10:48] Heavenly registry it's got to be that
[1:10:51] way why because the title deed is given
[1:10:55] to to someone who's going to receive the
[1:10:59] inheritance so it's got to Bey
[1:11:02] on the title
[1:11:06] deed that's right brother Brenham said
[1:11:09] those
[1:11:11] names are written within the
[1:11:18] book he said it's a registry of
[1:11:22] God's seed Gene
[1:11:25] amen because God is interested in his
[1:11:29] family he's interested in fact all the
[1:11:32] way in all of the books of the Bibles we
[1:11:34] find
[1:11:36] genealogies and Abraham begat Isaac
[1:11:39] Isaac begat Jacob and so on and so forth
[1:11:41] and you read long
[1:11:44] genealogies why he's showing you a
[1:11:46] registry amen he's showing you something
[1:11:49] that is going to foreshadow what God is
[1:11:52] doing even in this end time now
[1:11:56] we see the work of redemption done in
[1:11:58] many stories within the Bible but the
[1:12:01] one of of Boaz as the kinsman redeemer
[1:12:05] and how that he redeems Naomi and Ruth
[1:12:09] is a real good picture for this end time
[1:12:12] now brother Brenham says in the third
[1:12:14] seal let me just build up now as we go
[1:12:17] he says we found out that a slain lamb
[1:12:20] is a bloody lamb bleeding all over it's
[1:12:23] been slain it's been slain
[1:12:25] I it had raised again and was sitting on
[1:12:28] the throne and say back in the throne
[1:12:31] like this interceding for all those
[1:12:33] Souls that would come then when the last
[1:12:37] one was here and it was completed what
[1:12:40] is he talking about when that last one
[1:12:42] that's on the
[1:12:43] registry when it comes in he says when
[1:12:46] it has finally come into and takes its
[1:12:50] position he said God still held that
[1:12:53] book of
[1:12:54] redemption he's just doing the Kinsman
[1:12:57] work
[1:12:58] now like Boaz went down and Ruth was
[1:13:01] just sitting there waiting until Boaz I
[1:13:05] mean Boaz done the Kinsman redeeming
[1:13:09] work amen The Book of Ruth is actually
[1:13:12] one of my favorite
[1:13:14] books I love to read it because it seems
[1:13:17] like every other sentence every other
[1:13:20] verse of the Book of
[1:13:22] Ruth just tells another portion of the
[1:13:26] story of redemption it's all written
[1:13:29] right there if you understand the Book
[1:13:31] of Ruth you understand the whole Plan of
[1:13:36] Redemption The Book of Ruth actually
[1:13:38] opens up with the death of three
[1:13:41] people but it ends in a wedding
[1:13:46] Hallelujah there's a loss of inheritance
[1:13:49] people are out of the promised land they
[1:13:52] have no no hope in fact
[1:13:56] when IMC
[1:13:57] dies and Naomi is left
[1:14:01] there she says you should name me Mara
[1:14:06] because God has dealt with me
[1:14:08] bitterly how many know that's what your
[1:14:10] Bible says and how many times even
[1:14:13] though we as elect
[1:14:16] seed and we sometimes suffer because of
[1:14:20] our own consequences that we have done
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:26] that's right and then when you go
[1:14:30] through some very hard trials you say
[1:14:33] this is too bitter you might as well say
[1:14:36] God is dealing with me
[1:14:39] bitterly but thank God you don't stay in
[1:14:43] a place of bitterness because you're
[1:14:45] going to find out that all things work
[1:14:48] together for the good to them that love
[1:14:51] God Amen somebody say Amen to that
[1:14:55] oh you might have some times of real
[1:14:57] testings and trials who's without it
[1:15:01] every son and daughter of God must be
[1:15:04] tried and tested to see What You're Made
[1:15:09] Of you see when you catch the revelation
[1:15:13] of the story of redemption it's all
[1:15:15] written right there in the Book of
[1:15:19] Ruth she says call me
[1:15:22] Mara but you see watch this sadness has
[1:15:26] turned to
[1:15:27] Joy and they all sing a new song at the
[1:15:30] end of the Harvest Time the Bible opens
[1:15:34] with the death of three
[1:15:37] people a loss of
[1:15:40] inheritance and it
[1:15:42] ends with a wedding where the bride is
[1:15:44] united with the
[1:15:46] groom are we seeing typ and Shadow here
[1:15:50] now everyone is
[1:15:52] rejoicing sadness turns to Joy Joy the 4
[1:15:55] and 20 Elders fall down and those
[1:15:59] 10,000s times thousands and thousands
[1:16:02] all began to worship the lamb that had
[1:16:05] been
[1:16:06] slain and they begin to sing a new
[1:16:09] song
[1:16:11] now the Kinsman is actually one who is
[1:16:15] related to you by blood or
[1:16:19] marriage it is the one who is called who
[1:16:22] has the right to
[1:16:23] redeem
[1:16:26] redemption in Hebrews means to set free
[1:16:31] by the paying the price of the
[1:16:34] penalty it has two
[1:16:37] parts a coming out and going
[1:16:41] into and so we understand that
[1:16:44] Redemption therefore has two parts you
[1:16:47] come out of something but then you go
[1:16:49] into something
[1:16:50] else we don't want to just say praise
[1:16:53] God I came out of hisory Babylon it came
[1:16:56] out of
[1:16:58] denominationalism but that we must say
[1:17:01] we're going into the Promised
[1:17:04] word which is the message of this
[1:17:13] hour Redemption is actually referred to
[1:17:17] over 15 times in the Book of Ruth the
[1:17:20] third chapter alone 15 times redeem this
[1:17:25] redeem redeem 15 times in one
[1:17:30] chapter Boaz had to bring both Naomi and
[1:17:34] Ruth out of bondage and then bring them
[1:17:38] to their
[1:17:40] inheritance and he had to perform the
[1:17:43] right of the nearer
[1:17:46] Kinsmen and I want you to understand
[1:17:49] this that it was their Union with
[1:17:53] Boaz one as a
[1:17:56] Kinsman and two as a
[1:18:00] husband Boaz now brings them back into
[1:18:04] their inheritance that was lost by
[1:18:08] immc and there remember now there were
[1:18:11] two daughters that had married excuse me
[1:18:14] two women that had married the
[1:18:18] sons of a
[1:18:23] limc
[1:18:27] so when you know this story here and you
[1:18:31] look at it and you see um you will find
[1:18:36] out that Naomi and Ruth are spoken about
[1:18:40] in The Inheritance but orpa
[1:18:44] never why she was given the choice do
[1:18:47] you want to go or why don't you go back
[1:18:50] she went ahead and went back let me say
[1:18:53] this there is no in inheritance to those
[1:18:55] who go
[1:19:03] back so now three main characters of the
[1:19:08] book are Naomi Ruth and Boaz amen the
[1:19:14] three main characters of the whole Bible
[1:19:16] is Israel the bride and
[1:19:22] Jesus Naomi is a type of that or
[1:19:24] Orthodox Jewish Church God's chosen
[1:19:28] people they are known as the people of
[1:19:30] God they are the descendants of Adam who
[1:19:33] was the son of God down to Abraham and
[1:19:37] Ruth is a type of a gentile
[1:19:41] Church chosen by
[1:19:44] God and she is from the land of Moab do
[1:19:48] you know where Moab comes from it is the
[1:19:52] incestuous
[1:19:53] family the results from
[1:19:56] lot the first daughter that went into
[1:20:00] her father brought
[1:20:01] forth
[1:20:03] Moab where you get the
[1:20:05] mobites the next
[1:20:08] one came and brought forth the ammonites
[1:20:11] both of them that gave Israel all kinds
[1:20:14] of
[1:20:19] trouble and Boaz is called the lord of
[1:20:23] the Harvest
[1:20:26] he's in charge of all of the
[1:20:28] Reapers and when you look at the lineage
[1:20:31] of Boaz he is a son of Salon who married
[1:20:39] Rahab are we together on
[1:20:43] that it was during the the destruction
[1:20:46] of
[1:20:48] Jericho that they had sent
[1:20:50] in two spies brother Brenham actually
[1:20:53] calls them two tape
[1:20:57] boys it says and what she did she opened
[1:21:01] her her house and made a
[1:21:05] church and she had heard about the
[1:21:08] devastation that was coming because
[1:21:10] Joshua was the avenging
[1:21:15] Angel so she she hid the two spies in
[1:21:20] her
[1:21:23] home and and she said I want you because
[1:21:26] of my kindness that I'm doing to you I
[1:21:30] want you to tell me you won't destroy me
[1:21:33] and my family when you
[1:21:35] come and they said well we'll tell you
[1:21:38] you've got to apply a
[1:21:41] token H are you
[1:21:44] listening it ain't just agreeing with
[1:21:47] it it ain't just recognizing what's
[1:21:51] happening but it's to apply the token
[1:21:54] said if you'll hang that Scarlet thread
[1:21:57] which is a type of the blood of Christ
[1:21:59] if you will hang that outside the window
[1:22:02] let me tell you the death angels and
[1:22:04] judgment will not strike
[1:22:07] youall hallelujah thank God for that
[1:22:11] [Applause]
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:15] token no doubt Boaz has heard the story
[1:22:18] many times from his mother
[1:22:23] RAB
[1:22:26] it said I was lost
[1:22:29] undone I was a harlot
[1:22:32] right but because I
[1:22:36] recognized what God was doing and I made
[1:22:40] my home a
[1:22:44] church I had a invisible Union I saw the
[1:22:50] uniting time and sign that's right
[1:22:53] praise the Lord yes and they
[1:22:57] said if you'll have this token outside
[1:23:01] your window if you'll get your
[1:23:04] family under that token said we are not
[1:23:09] responsible if you don't get your family
[1:23:11] underneath that token amen God help us
[1:23:16] to apply the
[1:23:17] token get our family in I don't know if
[1:23:20] they whether they understand it or not
[1:23:23] but you just say get in and get under
[1:23:26] that
[1:23:28] token she was redeemed from her shame
[1:23:30] and reproach of her past sins by her
[1:23:33] Union to
[1:23:39] salon and according to the Old Testament
[1:23:42] law and Deuteronomy 25: 5 and
[1:23:46] 6 if there is no air for the family name
[1:23:49] and
[1:23:50] inheritance and it's lost then a kinsman
[1:23:53] redeemer can redeem redeem the Widow and
[1:23:55] take her unto himself and raise up seed
[1:23:59] of his
[1:24:00] brother the firstborn which she Bears
[1:24:03] shall succeed in the name of his
[1:24:06] brother listen to those
[1:24:09] words and the
[1:24:12] firstborn that is and so we see now
[1:24:16] watch this Adam lost here's a a Son of
[1:24:21] God put in the Garden of Eden he lost
[1:24:24] his
[1:24:25] inheritance so now Christ Our kinsman
[1:24:29] redeemer had to come by way of Flesh bir
[1:24:33] to pay the penalty of the price of
[1:24:36] redemption that's why he went to Calvary
[1:24:40] amen that's why he was
[1:24:42] crucified there was a price to be
[1:24:46] paid right thank God that He Paid a Debt
[1:24:51] amen that I could not pay
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:57] Lord he could not God could not come
[1:25:01] down in a glorified body and pay the
[1:25:05] price no so he came down in a form of
[1:25:08] man which we called Emanuel God With
[1:25:14] Us he came down
[1:25:17] himself thank you Lord amen amen took
[1:25:21] upon
[1:25:22] himself the sins of man
[1:25:25] mankind
[1:25:26] Lord thank you
[1:25:32] Lord so we see the firstborn son shall
[1:25:36] succeed the name of his brother which is
[1:25:39] dead so the scripture says in 1
[1:25:42] Corinthians
[1:25:44] 15
[1:25:46] 45-47 and so it is written the first man
[1:25:49] Adam was a living
[1:25:51] soul and the last Adam was made a
[1:25:55] quickening
[1:25:57] spirit how be it that was not first
[1:26:01] which is
[1:26:02] spiritual but that which is natural and
[1:26:05] afterward that which is spiritual and
[1:26:07] the first man is of the
[1:26:09] earth earthy the second man is the Lord
[1:26:14] From
[1:26:15] Heaven now brother Brenham says in the
[1:26:17] sermon the law having a shadow
[1:26:20] 1954 he says watch this there goes the
[1:26:24] second adom one brought death and here
[1:26:27] comes the one bringing life two
[1:26:29] different Adams first Adam second
[1:26:33] Adam here's the one who's bringing life
[1:26:36] in the world the second one with his own
[1:26:38] blood hitting his legs like that the Son
[1:26:40] of God going to Calvary to bear away
[1:26:43] your our sins Yonder that through the
[1:26:45] shedding of blood to perfect a man or
[1:26:48] woman
[1:26:49] unconditionally and I love to use that
[1:26:52] word unconditionally because it when God
[1:26:55] made covenants with man he made him with
[1:26:58] Adam Adam couldn't keep it he made him
[1:27:00] with Noah Noah couldn't keep it he made
[1:27:03] it with Abraham and you find out that
[1:27:05] what he did with Abraham is he just kind
[1:27:07] of rigged this thing and he said Abraham
[1:27:10] I'm going to give you an unconditional
[1:27:12] Covenant it's not what you're going to
[1:27:14] do it's not how good you are it's not
[1:27:17] how many times you keep the Commandments
[1:27:20] it's not all of that but it's about me
[1:27:23] making a sacrif for you I'm going to
[1:27:26] make a covenant that that Abraham you're
[1:27:28] going to make it
[1:27:31] hallelujah thank you Lord are you
[1:27:32] listening to
[1:27:34] Abraham you're going to make it God's
[1:27:37] not looking at you on how good you are
[1:27:39] how many times you go to
[1:27:41] church the reason you go to church is
[1:27:44] because you show him you love him not
[1:27:50] because none of us going to walk through
[1:27:52] those perly Gates and say uh how many
[1:27:55] stars do I have on the roll up there
[1:27:58] every time I went to church like kids in
[1:28:00] kindergarten yeah you little star well I
[1:28:03] I deserve going yeah
[1:28:06] no it's
[1:28:09] Grace how many know it's
[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:13] Grace for by grace are you saved through
[1:28:18] faith and that is a gift of God it is
[1:28:21] not of Works lest any man boast
[1:28:24] so even the faith you got into believing
[1:28:27] that he's God God gave it to you thank
[1:28:30] you Lord so that ought to make every one
[1:28:32] of us humble and and say God it's just
[1:28:35] by your
[1:28:36] grace because you're the one that gave
[1:28:38] me Faith you're the one that called me
[1:28:40] you're the one that that has elected me
[1:28:43] you're the one that chose me I didn't
[1:28:44] choose you you chose me
[1:28:52] Hallelujah now
[1:28:55] now everything that the first Adam lost
[1:28:58] the second Adam redeemed
[1:29:02] amen that's why here on Earth Adam
[1:29:06] nature obeyed
[1:29:09] him he was a God over the garden over
[1:29:14] the Earth because God was the god of the
[1:29:17] universe over the whole
[1:29:21] thing I want you to understand
[1:29:25] that the first pull has to do with the
[1:29:28] outer
[1:29:29] Court the healing of the
[1:29:33] body the second pull goes in further
[1:29:37] called the inner
[1:29:39] Court Discerning of
[1:29:42] spirits and the third poll to the holy
[1:29:45] of
[1:29:46] holies the word revealed to the heart
[1:29:50] Thy word oh Lord have I hid in my heart
[1:29:54] amen not in my head where's the greatest
[1:29:55] battle ever fought about 18 Ines apart
[1:29:59] from the Mind listen you you you battle
[1:30:02] so many times in your mind you go
[1:30:06] through this trial that trial things
[1:30:08] happen to you and you I don't understand
[1:30:10] oh my I'm just like Naomi you might as
[1:30:13] well call my name Mara well hang on
[1:30:16] Naomi you got a kidsman redeemer that is
[1:30:19] right there and he is going to perform
[1:30:22] the work of a Kinsman Redeemer and when
[1:30:25] he does you're going to sing a new
[1:30:28] song hallelujah
[1:30:32] hallelujah amen four distinct phases of
[1:30:35] Ruth
[1:30:37] yeah one
[1:30:39] Ruth
[1:30:41] deciding she has to make a decision
[1:30:44] Naomi said why didn't you go back she
[1:30:47] said no no orpa said yeah I'll go
[1:30:51] back I keep wanting to say
[1:30:56] Oprah but I think it's the
[1:31:00] same they kiss God
[1:31:03] goodbye
[1:31:06] anyway Ruth
[1:31:09] deciding you see God chooses you but you
[1:31:12] got to you got free moral
[1:31:16] agency amen you have to
[1:31:20] say
[1:31:22] okay huh
[1:31:25] it's like I was so nervous when when I
[1:31:27] went to ask my wife if she'll marry me
[1:31:29] boyfriend girlfriend I loved her I
[1:31:31] thought she'd loved me and everything
[1:31:32] but boy I tell you what I needed so much
[1:31:34] strength I parked in front of the
[1:31:36] church that's where I propose I didn't
[1:31:38] go to some nice big mountain top or a
[1:31:40] Lakeside and beautiful all this stuff
[1:31:43] and you know violins playing everything
[1:31:46] man I'm shaking like a leaf and I said
[1:31:49] if says if this woman
[1:31:52] hesitates they she says give me time to
[1:31:55] pray about
[1:31:57] it so I pulled up in front of the church
[1:31:59] you know God give me
[1:32:03] all sandy sandy will you uh uh Sandy
[1:32:08] will you uh will you marry me and she
[1:32:12] said yes and I was about ready to well
[1:32:15] if you can't
[1:32:17] give yes that was too quick that was too
[1:32:22] easy she
[1:32:24] decided I
[1:32:26] chose but she chose my
[1:32:32] choosing are you understanding God chose
[1:32:35] you he says I've chosen you you haven't
[1:32:39] chosen me but when you recognize he
[1:32:43] chose you what do you do I choose to go
[1:32:45] with
[1:32:46] [Applause]
[1:32:50] him Rebecca do you ch choose just the
[1:32:55] gifts or do you want to go with elaser I
[1:32:57] choose to
[1:32:59] go see what I'm saying so Ruth deciding
[1:33:03] Ruth
[1:33:05] serving Ruth resting Ruth
[1:33:09] rewarded oh I love this story so if you
[1:33:12] want to turn with me to the second
[1:33:14] chapter of Ruth let's look at this real
[1:33:18] quickly to show you a few things cuz I
[1:33:20] love to watch this pattern develop it's
[1:33:23] kind of like seeing a picture within a
[1:33:26] picture when you look at it for a minute
[1:33:28] you might see an old hagged lady but you
[1:33:34] look at it closer and oh it turns into a
[1:33:37] beautiful woman it depends on your
[1:33:40] perspective so now the
[1:33:43] Bible is one of those things that when
[1:33:45] you look at it and you look at it
[1:33:49] outright you might see a wrong picture
[1:33:53] yeah but hang on and wait because let it
[1:33:57] develop you understand let it develop
[1:34:01] because there is something that is
[1:34:02] happening that is Supernatural that goes
[1:34:06] beyond the
[1:34:07] natural and if your footsteps are
[1:34:10] ordered of the Lord let me tell you God
[1:34:12] has watched over you and that elect seed
[1:34:16] since you were born Amen in fact he was
[1:34:19] so much looking over you that he knew
[1:34:22] what kind of character he knew what kind
[1:34:23] of complex and he took your great great
[1:34:26] great and you put them together and this
[1:34:28] teting and that all the way down until
[1:34:30] you came on the scene and there's not a
[1:34:32] one
[1:34:34] here whether you were expected planned
[1:34:38] or unwanted you came on the scene amen
[1:34:42] and let me tell every one of you none of
[1:34:43] you is a mistake that's
[1:34:47] right thank you Jesus you came here cuz
[1:34:51] God been watching over you how many of
[1:34:54] you even prior to
[1:34:56] conversion did you have these little
[1:34:58] near
[1:35:00] misses oh boy I almost bit the bullet on
[1:35:04] that
[1:35:05] one there was a there was a wreck there
[1:35:07] was a fall there was some kind of deal
[1:35:10] that happened oh my you've been dodging
[1:35:12] that thing for a long time but it really
[1:35:15] wasn't you God did not let your number
[1:35:18] get pulled he was watching over that
[1:35:21] elex se he knew you would come a time of
[1:35:28] recognition oh he says an elect seed can
[1:35:31] go a long time before he recognizes who
[1:35:33] he
[1:35:36] is some of you are so
[1:35:41] thickheaded he could have a donkey talk
[1:35:45] to you and you'd argue with the
[1:35:49] donkey God has watched over you Lord
[1:35:55] and you can go back in your life and see
[1:35:58] supernaturally that God has watched over
[1:36:01] you now Ruth Chap 2:
[1:36:06] 14-6 and Boaz says unto her at Meal Time
[1:36:11] Come Thou
[1:36:14] thither spiritual food in due season eat
[1:36:18] of the bread and dip thy morsel in the
[1:36:21] vinegar and she sat bes IDE the
[1:36:24] Reapers and he reached her parched corn
[1:36:28] and she did eat and was sufficed and
[1:36:32] left now parch corn is the new grain
[1:36:35] that's prepared on the spot the type of
[1:36:38] those crossing over in the first Exodus
[1:36:42] remember that the Mana ceased when they
[1:36:44] got into the promised land okay so
[1:36:47] something's happening
[1:36:49] here he gives her now Parts K verse 15
[1:36:53] and when she was risen up to glean Boaz
[1:36:56] commanded his young men saying let her
[1:36:58] glean even among the sheep and reproach
[1:37:01] her
[1:37:02] not he's saying hey
[1:37:04] boys I got a now a nice little virtuous
[1:37:08] woman that's going to be working down
[1:37:09] here don't you be bugging
[1:37:15] her and let fall also some of the
[1:37:18] handfuls of purpose for her and leave
[1:37:21] them that she may glean them and rebuke
[1:37:25] her
[1:37:26] not I want all of you to know that God
[1:37:29] has watched over you and he's told all
[1:37:30] of these other guys keep your hands off
[1:37:34] them and I'll tell you what that even
[1:37:36] right in the midst of laiaa I want you
[1:37:39] to drop to them once in a while handfuls
[1:37:41] of
[1:37:42] blessings
[1:37:44] amen wasn't something you
[1:37:47] deserved it wasn't cuz you're the best
[1:37:49] one to glean in the field no it's
[1:37:51] because it was on purpose
[1:37:54] let me tell you everything that is
[1:37:56] coming to you is on
[1:37:58] purpose you didn't just find that you
[1:38:00] just didn't come to this message it was
[1:38:04] on
[1:38:12] purpose actually if you know the story
[1:38:16] here Boaz is having
[1:38:17] communion with his bride before he
[1:38:20] redeems
[1:38:21] her true Hees it came
[1:38:24] down had communion with Abraham before
[1:38:27] the promise
[1:38:29] came Christ has communion with his
[1:38:33] disciples before he goes to
[1:38:36] Calvary and the prophet preaches
[1:38:39] communion before he leaves the
[1:38:43] scene I tell you it just gets Rich if
[1:38:47] you just start looking and seeing type
[1:38:48] after
[1:38:51] type and what Ruth had left over she
[1:38:54] brought to
[1:38:56] Naomi now here's an interesting thing
[1:38:58] when you look in the scriptures there
[1:39:01] and you find
[1:39:02] out when the Mother-in-law when Naomi
[1:39:06] says to Ruth she says um well what
[1:39:12] happened
[1:39:13] here how did it go my
[1:39:17] daughter and actually in the in the
[1:39:20] authorized version of the Hebrew text it
[1:39:22] says who are you my daughter in other
[1:39:25] words are you still Ruth the
[1:39:31] Mobius or are you the
[1:39:34] prospective Mrs
[1:39:38] Boaz did something
[1:39:41] happen because she was under
[1:39:49] expectation why would she ask the
[1:39:51] question why who are you my daughter
[1:39:54] she's saying did he
[1:39:57] propose did he make a
[1:40:00] promise are you
[1:40:03] engaged oh I love this so Ruth
[1:40:09] rests and She lays herself at the feet
[1:40:12] of Boaz why feet feed her
[1:40:21] possession and Boaz has communion with
[1:40:24] his
[1:40:26] bride and what he h what she has left
[1:40:29] over she brings to
[1:40:31] Naomi now what's interesting is when
[1:40:35] Ruth approaches
[1:40:36] Boaz and
[1:40:38] he she is following the instructions of
[1:40:42] Naomi Naomi says you're going to find
[1:40:44] him he's the lord of the Harvest and
[1:40:46] you're going to find him on the
[1:40:47] threshing
[1:40:48] floor so she goes down and she finds him
[1:40:51] on the threshing floor floor that's
[1:40:53] where he
[1:40:55] works he's working today this is the
[1:40:58] threshing floor thank you
[1:41:01] Lord this is where things in your life
[1:41:05] are
[1:41:06] beaten and
[1:41:08] threshed and blown out of your life any
[1:41:12] of you have ever been to a third world
[1:41:13] country and watched somebody thresh the
[1:41:16] wheat they don't have the the big
[1:41:18] refineries and and places like we do
[1:41:21] over here so I in Africa where they'll
[1:41:24] put or in India where they put all the
[1:41:26] Grain on the road they let the cars
[1:41:28] drive over it 50 m an
[1:41:33] hour there goes all the chaff and
[1:41:35] everything like that and the seed still
[1:41:36] stays there or they take it and they
[1:41:39] beat on it right then they take it and
[1:41:41] throw it in the air and don't you
[1:41:43] realize it when you come to church on
[1:41:47] why is that guy always on my case seems
[1:41:50] like he's always beating me always
[1:41:51] stepping on my toe always getting on my
[1:41:54] case I need to do this better I need to
[1:41:56] do that better you know what God's doing
[1:41:58] he's beating the chaff away from your
[1:42:01] seed Hallelujah and wins the doctrine
[1:42:04] and everything and his his fan is in his
[1:42:07] hand and he's thoroughly purging his
[1:42:10] wheat you don't need that in your life
[1:42:13] you don't need that in your life get
[1:42:14] away from the world there's things of
[1:42:16] the world what is he doing he's driving
[1:42:19] that chaff away from the sea thank you
[1:42:22] Lord somebody say thank you Lord
[1:42:27] you she requests him to spread his skirt
[1:42:33] over her
[1:42:35] yeah the skirt in
[1:42:37] Hebrew is shell s hu
[1:42:41] l or his
[1:42:44] H and there's an emblem on the Hem of
[1:42:48] the Garment that shows the rank or
[1:42:52] authority
[1:42:53] like a pilot who shows on his sleeve or
[1:42:58] on his shoulder here three stripes four
[1:43:02] Stripes
[1:43:06] shows the
[1:43:08] authority so
[1:43:11] when when Ruth puts herself under the
[1:43:15] authority of
[1:43:16] Boaz she just puts herself under his
[1:43:20] hem are you
[1:43:22] listening that's why you've got to come
[1:43:24] under the authority of Jesus Christ you
[1:43:27] just don't with your lips say you love
[1:43:30] him and your hearts are far from
[1:43:32] him but we come under his headship thank
[1:43:36] God we're in the time of the
[1:43:39] headship and here we are at this
[1:43:42] changing of
[1:43:44] dispensations and Nebuchadnezzar who had
[1:43:47] a dream and Daniel saw the dream also
[1:43:50] and he said I'm telling you head of gold
[1:43:52] Brad silver but there's coming a
[1:43:55] time he said that this image this
[1:43:58] Gentile image are you
[1:44:01] listening this Gentile dispensation is
[1:44:04] quickly
[1:44:05] closing he said there's five Western
[1:44:08] five eastern he says kusf and
[1:44:12] Eisenhower met at the United Nations
[1:44:15] five Western five
[1:44:17] eastern Eisenhower means iron kusf means
[1:44:21] clay and here it was us trying the
[1:44:24] mingling and they won't mingle but at
[1:44:27] that time there's coming an image
[1:44:29] there's coming a stone a Capstone if you
[1:44:33] please that's coming out of heaven and
[1:44:35] it's coming and smiting this image
[1:44:39] Hallelujah that's what's happening now
[1:44:41] this message you'll never destroy this
[1:44:43] message that's right you can't destroy
[1:44:46] it why this message is Christ it is a
[1:44:49] Capstone Ministry it is a token message
[1:44:55] than
[1:45:02] you here's
[1:45:04] something
[1:45:08] interesting when she is discovered at
[1:45:12] his
[1:45:13] feet he says who are
[1:45:16] you she didn't say Ruth the
[1:45:20] Mobius she's already got
[1:45:24] Revelation she's already under his and
[1:45:27] she says I'm Ruth thy hand
[1:45:34] me she's already
[1:45:37] saying and then watch he answers her and
[1:45:40] he says my
[1:45:42] daughter stay
[1:45:46] here and rest amen
[1:45:49] until the rising of the Sun
[1:45:56] until a new
[1:45:59] day am fear not little church am
[1:46:04] Shalom don't you realize there's been a
[1:46:07] new
[1:46:08] dat that has dawned over the bride peace
[1:46:13] I give unto you what's God doing he's
[1:46:16] declaring don't fear because I the
[1:46:19] Kinsman don't worry I that told you I
[1:46:22] would do all all these things I will not
[1:46:24] rest until the kinsman redeemer is done
[1:46:27] until I've done it but there's a nearer
[1:46:38] Kinsman Philippians 1 and6 be confident
[1:46:41] of this very thing that he which begun a
[1:46:43] good work in you will perform it till
[1:46:46] the day of Jesus
[1:46:47] Christ so which one of you are just
[1:46:50] sitting there shaking in your boots
[1:46:51] wondering if God's going to finish the
[1:46:53] work he
[1:46:56] started how many of you can say I I know
[1:46:59] he started to work in
[1:47:03] me then we also have to have this
[1:47:06] confidence
[1:47:08] hey he's going to finish it that's his
[1:47:11] business praise the Lord listen he's
[1:47:14] going to save you despite
[1:47:18] yourself why we were yet
[1:47:21] sinners Christ died for us it wasn't
[1:47:25] until after we come to the knowledge
[1:47:27] after we became good people after we got
[1:47:29] baptized after we got the Holy Ghost
[1:47:31] after a no no before all of that in fact
[1:47:35] before the foundation of the world God
[1:47:37] plac on your finger unmar
[1:47:46] favor amen Ruth became confident
[1:47:49] believing the words of
[1:47:51] Boaz
[1:47:53] is not the bride doing the same thing
[1:47:56] I'm confident that this work that Jesus
[1:47:58] said he's going to finish he'll do
[1:48:01] it Ruth 3 let's read Ruth 3:
[1:48:07] 9-13 and he said who art thou and she
[1:48:09] said I am Ruth thy
[1:48:12] handmade spread therefore thy skirt over
[1:48:15] thine handmaid for thou art a near
[1:48:20] Kinsman he said blessed be thou of the
[1:48:23] Lord my daughter already having
[1:48:26] relationship do you see he's saying
[1:48:28] you're my
[1:48:30] family for thou H has showed more
[1:48:34] kindness in the latter end than at the
[1:48:36] beginning in so much as thou followed
[1:48:39] not the young men whether rich or
[1:48:42] poor
[1:48:44] yeah she was
[1:48:46] tested
[1:48:48] amen who you going to follow
[1:48:51] after come
[1:48:53] on and now my daughter fear
[1:48:57] not I will do to thee all that thou
[1:49:00] requirest for all the Sea of my people
[1:49:02] do know the I a virtuous woman see
[1:49:05] Talk's been going around all the people
[1:49:07] hey you know hey you guys know that lady
[1:49:11] named Ruth out there she well she's from
[1:49:13] Mo Moab she's a Mobius but boy oh boy
[1:49:18] she's a virtuous woman it's gone through
[1:49:23] the
[1:49:30] family and now it's true that I am thy
[1:49:34] near Kinsman how be it there is a
[1:49:37] Kinsman nearer than i t this night and
[1:49:40] it shall be in the
[1:49:41] morning that if he will perform unto
[1:49:44] thee the part of a Kinsman well let him
[1:49:46] do the Kinsman part but if he will not
[1:49:49] do the part of a Kinsman to thee then I
[1:49:53] will do the part of the Kinsman to thee
[1:49:55] as the Lord liveth lie down until the
[1:50:01] morning what happened there was a cloud
[1:50:04] on the title any of you know when you
[1:50:06] buy a piece of property you buy title
[1:50:09] insurance to make sure there's no
[1:50:11] incumbrance on that title so that when
[1:50:13] you buy it that the title can be
[1:50:16] transferred from whoever had ownership
[1:50:18] to it to your ownership but if there's a
[1:50:22] cloud on the title it's got to be taken
[1:50:25] care
[1:50:26] of so we had a cloud on our title that's
[1:50:30] right we had a nearer
[1:50:34] Kinsman and before we could be redeemed
[1:50:38] we had to give him an
[1:50:40] opportunity but guess what he won't pay
[1:50:42] the price that's
[1:50:47] right Adam sin the whole human race was
[1:50:50] taken out of position with their inher
[1:50:52] inance and the nearer
[1:50:54] Kinsman was our association un Union to
[1:50:57] our first husband that had rule over you
[1:51:00] watch this the invisible Union of the
[1:51:02] bride of Christ brother R says that now
[1:51:06] it was your nature associated with
[1:51:10] death your first husband that had rule
[1:51:13] over you was your Nature by natural
[1:51:17] birth every one of you came into the
[1:51:19] world hybrid amen
[1:51:24] natural you love the world because you
[1:51:27] are the world and part of the world is
[1:51:29] that right your desires was by nature to
[1:51:32] love the world which you're a part of
[1:51:35] you're a part of nature you believe that
[1:51:37] that's your natural thing that's the
[1:51:39] reason you have to be born again because
[1:51:42] that which is of the flesh is
[1:51:46] flesh you don't have to tell a kid how
[1:51:49] to lie they know how to lie you don't
[1:51:52] have to tell them how
[1:51:54] to beat to the music just put the music
[1:51:57] on and put a little baby in front of the
[1:52:00] speaker they're Born to
[1:52:03] Boogie it's nature amen so your nearer
[1:52:08] Kinsman was the relationship that you
[1:52:11] had because of the Fall you came down
[1:52:14] here in a body that had to be born
[1:52:17] again oh I love it well you can't live
[1:52:21] with it say that's the
[1:52:23] reason you have to be born again you
[1:52:25] have to separate you had to die to that
[1:52:27] first husband you can't live with it you
[1:52:29] can't say well I'll divorce him and hang
[1:52:31] him up there till the occasion no sir no
[1:52:34] writing of divorcement he dies the
[1:52:36] nature of the world has to die and every
[1:52:39] spec of him has to die you have to be
[1:52:41] reunited with another
[1:52:44] nature born again there's really been a
[1:52:48] change in
[1:52:49] me born again just like Jesus said watch
[1:52:55] this born again he says I'm now a new
[1:52:58] creature in Christ those things which I
[1:53:00] hated now I love and those things that I
[1:53:04] love I now
[1:53:07] hate thank you Lord for the new
[1:53:10] birth thank
[1:53:17] you I want you to notice in the Book of
[1:53:20] Psalms chter 49: verses 6 through 8 they
[1:53:25] that trust in their wealth and boast
[1:53:28] themselves in the multitude of their
[1:53:30] riches none of them can by any means
[1:53:34] redeem his brother nor give to God a
[1:53:38] ransome for him for the Redemption of
[1:53:42] their soul is precious and it ceases
[1:53:46] forever so it's
[1:53:48] not see just by
[1:53:50] riches it's got to be a nearer Kinsman
[1:53:54] it got to be part of the family did you
[1:53:56] know that Naomi now watch
[1:54:00] this I I'm just going to Rabbit Trail
[1:54:03] here for just a minute and you just
[1:54:05] follow along with me Naomi is married to
[1:54:10] IMC and Boaz is of the family or the
[1:54:14] tribe of
[1:54:16] IMC now they leave and they go to a
[1:54:19] place called Moab they leave the
[1:54:21] promised land they go into Moab and they
[1:54:25] set up having
[1:54:27] church it's so sad that instead of
[1:54:30] staying where God had told him to stay
[1:54:32] in the promised land that he goes now to
[1:54:36] a place of Moab
[1:54:39] incestuous unclean compromising type
[1:54:43] people and he goes there and guess what
[1:54:46] he has two
[1:54:48] sons maon and chilon and maon means
[1:54:51] invalid
[1:54:54] and chilon means a whiner and a
[1:54:59] complainer you know anybody like
[1:55:04] that it is a type of when here a seed
[1:55:08] Gene of God limc
[1:55:11] leaves and goes elsewhere sets up church
[1:55:15] and guess what they have not enough seed
[1:55:18] to bring forth life therefore when LMC
[1:55:21] dies it took 10 years and guess what
[1:55:25] maon and chilion don't have any
[1:55:30] kids
[1:55:32] Ruth and orpa have no kids the church is
[1:55:37] not
[1:55:39] growing but finally Naomi has enough
[1:55:42] sense to say you know what I don't
[1:55:44] belong here my inheritance is here if
[1:55:47] there's anything that I'm going to do
[1:55:49] I'm going back to where IMC was birth
[1:55:52] that why because my union my union to
[1:55:57] ELC a woman's right of inheritance is
[1:56:02] through the
[1:56:04] man and the bride's inheritance is
[1:56:07] through Jesus Christ and you become
[1:56:11] joiners all that I am you can be
[1:56:14] everything I own is part
[1:56:18] yours the
[1:56:21] Lord
[1:56:23] H praise the
[1:56:27] Lord how many families have you
[1:56:29] seen that have left the message of the
[1:56:33] hour to go somewhere else for a better
[1:56:39] job and they go there and they they work
[1:56:42] and guess what they have their little
[1:56:44] church woman is a
[1:56:48] church and there's no seed there's
[1:56:51] nothing
[1:56:54] now God blessed Abraham as long as he
[1:56:58] stayed in the promised land when he got
[1:57:00] out of the promised land he lost his
[1:57:01] Blessing is that right not his Covenant
[1:57:04] he lost his Blessing now brother brand
[1:57:07] picks us up recognizing your day in its
[1:57:12] message I'm just going to take the the
[1:57:14] portion here and
[1:57:16] highlight Israel in her land drove
[1:57:20] them in there hurted them in there like
[1:57:24] sheep the Wolves got after her and run
[1:57:27] them back to safety to their own land
[1:57:30] how many of you know that brother
[1:57:31] Brenham said the the loving tender hand
[1:57:35] of Jehovah drove the Jews back to
[1:57:41] Israel they were
[1:57:43] persecuted I've been to aitz been there
[1:57:47] twice I've seen what they did in the
[1:57:51] Holocaust I've seen the starvation
[1:57:54] shells I've seen the Wall of Death I've
[1:57:58] seen the gas
[1:57:59] Chambers I've seen the
[1:58:02] crematoriums and they did all of that
[1:58:05] and tried to exterminate a race of
[1:58:09] people because of what they
[1:58:14] believed and the anti-Semitism that
[1:58:17] you're seeing against Israel right
[1:58:20] now will come against the
[1:58:26] Christians it's coming am I say oh
[1:58:32] God take us out of
[1:58:34] here I don't want to be no foolish
[1:58:36] virgin I don't want to stay here when
[1:58:39] that peel horse rider begins to ride and
[1:58:42] death and Hell follow him that's
[1:58:47] right remember Israel's only promise to
[1:58:50] be blessed as long as she's in her land
[1:58:53] God never blessed Israel outside of the
[1:58:55] land Abraham went outside the land was
[1:58:57] condemned and everyone that leaves the
[1:59:00] land is condemned God only can bless
[1:59:02] Israel when she stays in her Homeland
[1:59:05] and she is there now as a nation and the
[1:59:07] church is called she's just only waiting

[2:02:59] keep going
[2:03:05] on he says nail me and Boaz just a
[2:03:10] perfect
[2:03:11] picture Naomi in the time of famine left
[2:03:14] the church left the country went over
[2:03:15] into Moab land to dwell there and
[2:03:18] sojourn there when she comes back she
[2:03:21] brings back the beautiful young Mite
[2:03:24] Widow with
[2:03:25] her and when Boaz saw this Widow a type
[2:03:29] of Christ he fell
[2:03:32] for and he loved
[2:03:34] her so he had to
[2:03:37] redeem the only way he could ever get
[2:03:39] her to be a wife was to redeem what his
[2:03:42] brother
[2:03:43] immc had
[2:03:48] lost Naomi's only inheritance is through
[2:03:51] the
[2:03:52] union with her
[2:03:55] husband do you realize that you women
[2:03:58] according to scripture your inheritance
[2:04:01] is through your union with your
[2:04:10] husband Ruth decides to go with Naomi in
[2:04:13] fact she's given the
[2:04:15] decision and I think it's some of the
[2:04:17] most wonderful words she says whether
[2:04:19] thou
[2:04:20] goest I will go
[2:04:22] amen your God will be my
[2:04:25] God your people will be my people and

[2:04:41] [Music]
[2:04:43] land Ruth made a commitment to stay with
[2:04:49] Naomi and brought her into the position
[2:04:51] to meet her kinsman
[2:04:54] redeemer the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[2:04:58] was when the price was paid for
[2:05:00] [Music]
[2:05:02] Redemption thank you Lord he said it's
[2:05:04] finished he paid the price thank you
[2:05:06] Lord he was the Lamb of
[2:05:10] God he was
[2:05:13] crucified he struggled so bad remember
[2:05:16] you can't kill
[2:05:18] God spirit of God left him in the Garden
[2:05:22] of
[2:05:24] Gethsemane he asked let this cup pass
[2:05:27] from me but
[2:05:28] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[2:05:33] done spirit of God left him and there he
[2:05:37] as a mortal
[2:05:40] man bleeding and bruised was whipped up
[2:05:43] the
[2:05:44] hill There They Crucified
[2:05:48] him until the man Christ Jesus Cries Out
[2:05:51] Eli Eli
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:56] Lama my
[2:05:59] God
[2:06:02] why have you forsaken
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:09] me and he
[2:06:11] says
[2:06:13] it
[2:06:16] is
[2:06:18] finished the
[2:06:20] price kinsman
[2:06:23] redeemer by his own
[2:06:26] blood not the blood of bulls and goats
[2:06:28] by the Lamb of God
[2:06:31] himself and he was
[2:06:33] crucified but there's another
[2:06:36] part most denomination have got no idea
[2:06:39] there's another part it's called the
[2:06:42] seven sealed book of
[2:06:47] redemption who's worthy chapter five
[2:06:53] who's worthy to take the book and to
[2:06:55] loose the seals
[2:06:57] thereof and I looked in heaven and I
[2:06:59] looked on Earth and there was no one
[2:07:01] worthy no one to take the book The Price
[2:07:04] had been paid but there's nobody there
[2:07:07] to actually take it and redeem it it's
[2:07:11] mine and I John
[2:07:15] wept one of the elders behind him said
[2:07:18] we've not John yes for the lion of the
[2:07:23] tribe of
[2:07:24] Judah Boaz is of the tribe of
[2:07:28] [Music]
[2:07:34] Judah and the
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:37] lamb changes
[2:07:41] transforms because he come he turns to
[2:07:43] look at a lamb having been slain and
[2:07:46] what does he see a
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:07:50] lion
[2:07:52] and a lion is
[2:07:55] Judge he's now bringing a
[2:07:58] judgment brother Ram said there he is
[2:08:02] white hair of his
[2:08:03] wig look at his picture there he is
[2:08:06] Ancient of Days who is it the Supreme
[2:08:10] judge looking down on the
[2:08:15] earth this message this seven sealed
[2:08:19] book of redemption we had no idea it was
[2:08:23] the second
[2:08:27] part until this Prophet comes and tells
[2:08:33] us no
[2:08:35] one is going to be
[2:08:38] redeemed off of the earth now watch this
[2:08:41] now we're talking about the fullness of
[2:08:43] the Redemption at the first
[2:08:47] resurrection we all know what that is
[2:08:49] when the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:08:53] that's the first
[2:08:55] resurrection and only those in the first
[2:08:58] resurrection are those whose names are
[2:09:00] written in the Lamb's Book of Life not
[2:09:03] book of
[2:09:05] life but the Lamb's Book of Life the
[2:09:08] Bible says and everyone will have will
[2:09:11] whose names are not written in the
[2:09:12] Lamb's Book of Life will be
[2:09:17] deceived there's only a small group of
[2:09:20] people on the Earth
[2:09:22] that happen to see these things that are
[2:09:23] going on right now and the reason that
[2:09:25] they don't celebrate Christmas with a
[2:09:27] Christmas tree and Santa Claus and do
[2:09:30] all of that kind of stuff nor give out
[2:09:32] chocolate Easter bunnies and do Easter
[2:09:34] egg hunts and all that stuff why because
[2:09:36] they know
[2:09:40] better they've come out come out of her
[2:09:43] my
[2:09:44] people be ye separate sayeth the Lord so
[2:09:48] while God is now finishing up with the
[2:09:50] Gentile
[2:09:52] by giving to us a message and getting us
[2:09:55] prepared guess what Israel is getting
[2:09:57] ready to receive their two
[2:10:00] prophets can't you see the blending of
[2:10:03] the dispensation is just about over it's
[2:10:06] just about home time hallelujah
[2:10:15] hallelujah Ruth chapter 4 let me close
[2:10:18] with Ruth chapter 4 here and Ruth 4:1
[2:10:23] and all the people were in the gate and
[2:10:26] the elders we Are
[2:10:29] Witnesses Lord make the woman that has
[2:10:31] come into thine house like Rachel and
[2:10:34] Leah two women mentioned Rachel and
[2:10:38] Leah who are actually bore unto Jacob
[2:10:42] eight
[2:10:44] sons who became founding tribes of the
[2:10:47] nation of
[2:10:49] Israel so this woman that comes into the
[2:10:51] house may she be like Rachel and
[2:10:54] Leah which did build the house of Israel
[2:10:58] and do thou worthily in ephrath and be
[2:11:01] famous in
[2:11:05] Bethlehem the word ephrath means
[2:11:08] [Music]
[2:11:09] fruitful they want Ruth to become
[2:11:11] fruitful and bring honor to a little
[2:11:14] insign insignificant city called
[2:11:19] Bethlehem later called the city of
[2:11:24] David
[2:11:28] wow verse
[2:11:30] 12 and let thy house be like the house
[2:11:32] of
[2:11:34] ferah whom T
[2:11:37] Tamar bear unto
[2:11:40] Judah wow remember what Tamar did in
[2:11:43] order to get
[2:11:44] [Music]
[2:11:50] seed
[2:11:52] so Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife
[2:11:57] and he went in under her and the lord
[2:11:58] gave her conception and she bear a
[2:12:01] son
[2:12:04] wow the woman said to
[2:12:07] Naomi blessed be the
[2:12:10] Lord which
[2:12:13] hath not left thee this day without a
[2:12:19] Kinsman that his name may be famous in
[2:12:23] Israel and he shall be unto thee a
[2:12:26] restorer of thy
[2:12:30] life are you listening to
[2:12:33] Mara remember she says don't don't call
[2:12:36] me Naomi call me

[2:12:42] going to restore unto you your
[2:12:45] life and a nurser of thine old age for
[2:12:48] thy daughter-in-law which is Ruth
[2:12:52] which loveth
[2:12:54] thee is better to thee than
[2:12:58] seven
[2:13:01] songs better than the seven Messengers
[2:13:04] sent to the seven
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:08] churches because
[2:13:10] Ruth is the bride to
[2:13:15] boy you realize the day that we're
[2:13:17] living in this is the greatest day this
[2:13:19] is the cresendo
[2:13:21] it's greater than the
[2:13:25] creation greater than when he said let
[2:13:27] there be light and there was light
[2:13:30] and he did the fishes and the land and
[2:13:33] the trees and everything and he said it
[2:13:35] was good but this is the climax this is
[2:13:38] the
[2:13:42] cresendo and he's doing it ever so
[2:13:45] simple at all these things what Israel
[2:13:48] is doing right now are we looking at
[2:13:49] God's calendar
[2:13:52] can we see what Israel is doing can we
[2:13:55] see these eclipses for times and
[2:13:59] Seasons we can see the uniting time and
[2:14:02] sign the invisible Union of the bride of
[2:14:04] Christ can we see really what this
[2:14:06] message is all about it's not just
[2:14:09] church
[2:14:10] order I want all of you to understand
[2:14:13] that
[2:14:14] God is fulfilling his word in this
[2:14:19] hour oh it's so much
[2:14:22] more Amen on how to
[2:14:25] dress a way of
[2:14:27] Holiness but it's a
[2:14:30] relationship between you and
[2:14:33] Boaz your kinsman redeemer aren't you
[2:14:36] don't you love him today amen what makes
[2:14:39] us different than denomination out there

[2:14:57] you got that's
[2:15:00] right yours is so
[2:15:03] different you are different why God's
[2:15:06] called you to be different thank you
[2:15:08] Lord amen that's why you are what you
[2:15:11] are that's why God sent a prophet in
[2:15:13] this end end time that's why God sent an
[2:15:16] angel
[2:15:17] Messenger to turn your hearts back
[2:15:23] why cuz he's finishing up the act of
[2:15:27] redemption right now when this last
[2:15:30] Gentile comes in and the times of the
[2:15:33] Gentiles over there's not going to be
[2:15:35] another Gentile saved that's right no

[2:15:41] the earth she's going to go up
[2:15:43] Revelations 10's going to be finished
[2:15:46] you can't have Revelation 11 the two
[2:15:49] witnesses to Israel

[2:15:54] off the scene Joseph married a gentile
