[12:55] Lord. Amen. Understand brother Steve
[12:58] Clar is with us tonight. I'd like to ask
[12:59] brother Steve if he would come take us
[13:01] before the Lord in prayer. We have
[13:02] several prayer requests have been turned
[13:04] in tonight. Sister Suzanne has turned in
[13:07] a request for a young man back home in
[13:10] the church of this put back. He's in the
[13:13] ICU with very high blood white blood
[13:16] count. It's so high he needs to be
[13:19] monitored almost every day, every
[13:21] hour. He will have to be at the hospital
[13:23] for about a month. Amen. His name is
[13:26] Michael. So they're asking prayer for
[13:28] Michael. Pray the Lord would come on the
[13:29] scene and meet his
[13:31] need. Sister Deville is asking, we
[13:34] remember her daughter Naomi and her
[13:36] grandkids. They had a tornado went
[13:38] through their area, through their
[13:40] property. Her the kids are at a
[13:42] neighbor's house, but her daughter is
[13:43] unable to get back to the house because
[13:45] the roads are out. So, let's pray for
[13:47] Sister
[13:48] Deville's daughter and grandchildren.
[13:51] Sister Linda Green is asking prayer for
[13:53] her nephew, Jean Sha. He has cancer
[13:56] behind his eye. So, we know a God that
[13:59] can come on the scene and touch this
[14:02] this cancer. Praise the Lord. Sister
[14:04] Anne Love all says, "Please pray
[14:07] for my cousin's son, Michelle. He's a
[14:10] young believer, 18 years old. Yesterday,
[14:13] he was diagnosed with leukemia."
[14:16] Same prayer request. Okay. He was
[14:19] admitted to intensive care, already had
[14:21] first
[14:23] chemotherapy, and he's under dialysis.
[14:26] Amen. And so let's pray for this young
[14:28] man. Pray the Lord would just come and
[14:30] give him a mighty touch. And brother
[14:32] Mario is asking prayer for his sister. I
[14:35] believe her name is
[14:36] Maritus. She's suffering from cervical
[14:39] myopathy. The doctor said she may need
[14:42] to have surgery on her spine. May God
[14:44] intervene and come on the scene, touch
[14:46] her body with a complete healing. So I
[14:49] believe the Lord can do that. Nothing is
[14:51] too hard. Amen. How many would have a
[14:53] need tonight? Just want to lift that
[14:54] before the Lord. Brother Steve, if you
[14:56] would come and take us to the Lord in
[14:57] prayer
[14:58] [Music]
[15:09] tonight. Amen. Let's go to the
[15:13] Lord. Gracious heavenly father, we are
[15:16] so thankful. Yes, God that you have
[15:19] provided a place for us to come
[15:23] and to worship you, Lord. in spirit and
[15:25] in
[15:27] truth. And Father, we're asking that you
[15:29] would come in this meeting to take the
[15:31] first place.
[15:34] There has been many preparations been
[15:36] made and much energy put into meetings
[15:39] just like this. And Father, brothers
[15:42] have come and they've studied the word
[15:45] and they've come with a burden on their
[15:48] hearts to speak to your people this
[15:51] weekend.
[15:52] And Father, we open up our hearts wide,
[15:55] oh God, that you might come and anoint
[15:58] the brothers that they might speak words
[16:00] of life into our very beings, Lord.
[16:04] Father, we don't want this to be just an
[16:06] ordinary service, but Father, we want
[16:09] you to come and move upon your our
[16:12] hearts by your word. Heavens and earth
[16:15] will pass away, but you said your word
[16:18] should never pass away. Would you come
[16:22] in the beginning of this meeting as your
[16:24] minister would come and speak your word?
[16:27] We receive it already Lord. We receive
[16:29] it and we ask oh God even by the songs
[16:32] that would be sung that our
[16:33] hearts would become tender and soft
[16:36] before we pray. And Father before me are
[16:40] all these prayer requests and Lord I
[16:43] place my hands upon them and the church
[16:47] stands before you oh God. uh uniting
[16:51] their hearts for every single one of
[16:53] these needs. None of these needs are of
[16:56] a lesser, Lord. Each one are very
[16:58] serious and each one is on the heart of
[17:01] those that have written them in. So I
[17:04] pray, Father, that ones that need
[17:06] healing, I pray in the name of Jesus
[17:08] Christ that they would receive the
[17:10] healing, Lord. Father, you said you were
[17:13] wounded for our transgressions and
[17:16] bruised for our
[17:17] iniquities. And by the stripes that were
[17:20] upon your back, Lord, we can receive our
[17:23] healing. So, we take it by faith, Lord.
[17:25] That six sense that's in our life, we
[17:27] take it, Lord, and we hold fast, oh God,
[17:31] and those needs for our bodies, Lord,
[17:33] but there's those that need deliverance
[17:35] tonight and their spirit is in torment.
[17:37] I pray, God, that you come their way.
[17:40] Maybe there's somebody today, oh God,
[17:42] that needs, Father, healing, a
[17:44] deliverance of soul that you might fill
[17:46] them, Lord. I pray, God, that you would
[17:48] come on the scene. And so, Father, we
[17:51] give ourselves to you today, Lord, this
[17:54] weekend coming up, Lord, we give
[17:55] ourselves to you. And we ask, oh Lord,
[17:58] that you do the min ministering and the
[18:00] healing and the helping. Lord, we pray.
[18:03] We give you thanks now in Jesus name in
[18:05] this opening of this meeting. We glorify
[18:08] your name. Yes. And the church said,

[27:49] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[27:54] hand.
[27:56] And I know it's going to
[28:01] rain. In a time when it was dry, not a
[28:06] cloud up in the sky, the children of God
[28:10] began to reason
[28:13] why. So they went to God's man cuz they
[28:18] did not
[28:19] understand. He said, "Go look. It's
[28:23] written in the sky.
[28:26] I see a cloud like a man's
[28:31] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[28:37] hand. Yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[28:43] hand. And I know it's going to
[28:49] rain. Now they opened up the door. The
[28:53] second time they looked once more. A
[28:56] tiny cloud was rising from the
[29:01] sea. And they began to understand the
[29:05] time for rain was at
[29:08] hand. Just like God said it would
[29:13] be. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[29:19] Yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[29:25] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[29:30] [Music]
[29:32] hand. And I know it's going to
[29:37] rain. So today we have no fear. We have
[29:41] a cloud
[29:43] appear. The prophet scream, "My bride,
[29:46] go through that door.
[29:49] Have faith and just believe. A new
[29:53] spirit you'll
[29:55] receive. The rain is truly going to
[30:00] pour. Yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[30:06] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[30:11] hand.
[30:13] Yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[30:19] hand. And I know it's going to
[30:24] rain. Now the bride is looking above for
[30:28] a charity rain of love to fill their
[30:32] hearts with peace they never
[30:36] known. And soon this bride shall be
[30:40] God's unfolded
[30:43] mystery. The promised word has been
[30:47] revealed. Oh yes, I see a cloud like a
[30:52] man's
[30:54] hand. Yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[31:00] hand. I see a cloud like a man's head.
[31:08] And I know it's going to
[31:11] rain. Oh yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[31:17] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[31:23] hand. Yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[31:30] hand. And I know it's going to rain.

[32:57] 1987 over in the Black Forest of Germany
[33:01] there. And we went down to visit brother
[33:04] Lonnie Jenkins speaking at brother
[33:06] Garrett
[33:07] Rodalds. And of course we were over in
[33:10] Europe from ' 84 to '89. Started with
[33:12] Spoken Word and then went to Voice of
[33:14] God Recordings. But
[33:17] uh I knew I wasn't going to be staying
[33:19] there. And I went and and I asked
[33:21] Brother Lonnie, I said, "Brother Lonnie,
[33:24] I feel like I'm going to go back to
[33:26] America and everything." And I said,
[33:28] "How do you know God's will?" And you
[33:32] know, I just counseledled with him. And
[33:33] brother Lonnie was so wise and we just
[33:35] took a walk through the forest and
[33:37] everything. And I've been fasting and
[33:41] praying and asking God for guidance. And
[33:44] God spoke to my heart there in southern
[33:47] Germany.
[33:48] in an audible voice, he told me to go to
[33:52] Phoenix and start a church. That was in
[33:55] 1987. And so, it took several years for
[33:59] us to finally get here and everything,
[34:01] but we've been here. We started with
[34:03] just a handful of of people and uh but
[34:08] God has blessed us. Amen. And look what
[34:10] he's done.
[34:12] So, we thank God.
[34:15] Amen. And I'm so very pleased to have uh
[34:20] brother Jason and brother Chad here with
[34:24] us to minister for us. I believe we're
[34:27] in for a great treat. Brother David Dean
[34:29] Hart's good to see you. Incognito there
[34:31] with a little beard. Hey there. God
[34:34] bless you. Yeah. Just each and everyone.
[34:38] I'm glad I'm a Christian. Aren't you?
[34:40] Huh? Yeah. Listen, you was predestinated
[34:43] to hear this message. Yeah. Brother Bram
[34:46] said that seed gene of God, he said God
[34:49] placed it in there and he said you might
[34:51] not have known who you were, but when
[34:53] that light struck the seed, it took
[34:55] life. Hallelujah. That's what that's
[34:57] what there is a uh there's a strain that
[35:01] goes between each and every one of us.
[35:03] And what is that strain? It is the voice
[35:06] of God in this hour that God has sent.
[35:10] And he had sent a messenger and that
[35:14] messenger speaking. And when he spoke
[35:17] and you heard it, that's right. My
[35:19] sheep, that's right. Hear my voice and a
[35:21] stranger they will not follow.
[35:24] Hallelujah. You were ordained to catch
[35:27] this message.
[35:29] You can try to run from it. You can try
[35:31] to hide from it. But let me tell you, if
[35:32] you're Lex seed, you're going to God's
[35:34] going to get his man. Amen. Amen. All
[35:37] right. Praise the Lord. Listen, I'm just
[35:39] going to get out of the way, give it
[35:41] back to brother Mark and uh have another
[35:45] song special.
[35:48] Amen. I'm going to hear happy tonight.
[35:52] Sing talk about happy. I'm so happy. And
[35:54] our sister Perfect has a song. So if she
[35:56] wants to come and get ready while we're
[35:57] singing this. Talk about happy. I'm so
[36:00] happy. Praise the
[36:03] Lord. Talk about
[36:05] happy. Oh, I'm so
[36:08] happy since I
[36:10] laid my burden
[36:13] down. Oh, talk about
[36:16] happy. Oh, I'm so
[36:19] happy. Since I
[36:21] laid my burden

[36:26] shouting, "Oh, hallelujah."
[36:30] Since I
[36:32] play my burden
[36:34] down, I feel like
[36:37] shouting. Oh,
[36:40] hallelujah. Since
[36:43] I burden
[36:45] down, I'm going to walk on those streets
[36:49] of
[36:50] glory. Since I
[36:53] made my burden
[36:56] down, I'm going to walk on the streets
[37:00] of
[37:01] glory. Since I
[37:03] laid my burden
[37:06] down, oh glory,
[37:09] glory. Oh
[37:11] halleluah. Oh, since I
[37:14] laid my burden

[37:22] hallelujah. Since I
[37:24] play my burden, talk about happy. Oh,
[37:28] talk about
[37:30] happy. Oh, I'm so
[37:33] happy since I
[37:35] laid my burden
[37:38] down. Talk about
[37:40] happy. Oh, I'm so
[37:43] happy since I
[37:46] laid my burden down.
[37:52] Amen.
[37:55] Praise the Lord.
[37:58] Praise the Lord. God bless Sister
[38:00] Perfect. Thank you for singing for us
[38:01] tonight.
[38:09] Um, God bless you saints. Um, we'd like
[38:12] to say share something quickly. Um
[38:17] uh a few years back um sorry a few years
[38:21] back I was praying and after the moment
[38:25] of prayer God inspired me with these
[38:27] words you're about to hear. I managed to
[38:30] write 80% then closed the book and life
[38:33] moved on. A couple of weeks
[38:37] back, I was planning to sing a song cuz
[38:40] I was like, I haven't sang in a while
[38:43] and I was looking for different songs to
[38:45] to sing. And somehow I stumbled on these
[38:48] unfinished words. I then decided, let's
[38:51] finish the song. Don't ask me how, but
[38:54] it was like the floodgates of words just
[38:57] opened up and I just started writing.
[39:02] Yes.
[39:04] The day I planned to sing the song,
[39:06] unfortunately I was unable to.
[39:09] However, the Ron sermon of that day was
[39:12] the entire song.
[39:16] I pray the song version of this of
[39:19] brother brother Ron's sermon is a
[39:21] blessing to you.
[39:24] [Music]
[39:34] I'm a creation, a perfect
[39:37] reflection of Christ, my
[39:41] king. I'll fight this fight until I win
[39:46] my perfect crown. Here I am
[39:50] standing,
[39:52] believing he's Christ in me. I'm a
[39:57] creation that perfect
[39:59] reflection of
[40:03] Christ. We have the power to
[40:07] create. Speak the word today. Just like
[40:12] Brandon to call into
[40:17] existence the authority he
[40:21] gave to move into action.
[40:26] The third pool today is in our
[40:31] hands. I'm a creation, a perfect

[41:04] sounded the finish line before us. And
[41:08] by
[41:09] faith, I'll keep pressing
[41:14] on to persevere in his
[41:18] word, to walk in his footsteps. I'm
[41:23] reflected in his image. I won't
[41:28] fail. I'm a creation, a perfect
[41:32] reflection of Christ, my king. Yes, I'll
[41:37] fight this fight until I win my perfect
[41:42] crown. Here I am
[41:45] standing,
[41:46] believing he's Christ in me. I'm a
[41:51] creation that perfect reflection of
[41:57] Christ. The word speaks to
[42:01] me. I see myself in need.
[42:05] Transformation just like
[42:08] Sarah. Abraham is on
[42:12] me. A name and body
[42:15] change. The promise I've received. Oh,
[42:20] the choice he made on Calvary just for
[42:25] me. I'm a creation, a perfect reflection
[42:30] of Christ, my king. Yes, I'll fight this
[42:35] fight until I win my perfect crown. Here

[43:22] Christ. Here I am
[43:24] standing,
[43:26] believing he's Christ in me. I'm a
[43:31] creation that perfect
[43:33] reflection of
[43:37] [Music]
[43:43] Christ. Praise the Lord.
[43:50] Amen. I've got a little little message
[43:52] flashing at me here on the screen. It

[47:37] Praise the name of the Lord. Hello all
[47:39] you beautiful people. My turn around,
[47:42] shake hands with somebody. Say, "God
[47:44] bless you." It's my favorite thing to
[47:46] make audiences do. Turn around, shake
[47:48] hands, say, "God bless you." Brother
[47:50] Brandham said that is the nicest thing
[47:54] you can say to someone is God bless you.
[47:58] Hallelujah. Think about what it means if
[48:01] the creator of all things blesses you.
[48:05] Amen. It's what being on the winning
[48:07] team does for you. Hallelujah. Amen.
[48:11] Opens you up to all kinds of wonderful
[48:13] things. Oh yes, sir. Now you have to
[48:16] take advantage of it. I'm going to
[48:18] preach along those lines tonight. You're
[48:19] going to find out here in a little bit.
[48:21] And um you know, if you get a an an
[48:25] announcement that you had a rich uncle
[48:27] you never even knew and he left you a
[48:30] fortune, you got to go get it.
[48:34] You can't just go tell all your friends,
[48:36] I'm rich. And you never go to the
[48:38] lawyers meeting. You never sign
[48:39] anything. You never uh they even put in
[48:42] your bank and you don't even know. You
[48:43] don't even do you you just forget about
[48:45] it. Well, you're crazy.
[48:50] I don't I don't want to be that guy. I
[48:52] don't plan to do that. I want
[48:53] everything. Calvary provision.
[48:56] Hallelujah. Jesus paid a tremendous
[48:58] price. I just say we ought to avail
[49:01] ourselves of every bit of it. Amen.
[49:04] Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother
[49:06] Steve. So good to see you standing
[49:08] there. Amen. Happy to be here tonight.
[49:10] Happy to have my my running buddy over
[49:13] there, Brother Dale. I I think I came
[49:15] out the wrong door, but I was glad I did
[49:16] because I got to walk right out and
[49:18] shake his hand. Amen. Praise God. So, um
[49:22] been uh been a minute since we were
[49:24] here. I think back back in last October,
[49:26] maybe. But we want to look into the word
[49:29] of God tonight. Now, I'm I'm already
[49:31] going to get in trouble with the sound
[49:33] guys, but and they can hurt you. You
[49:35] don't want to upset them, but I I told
[49:38] them John and then Matthew 11, but we're
[49:40] going to go to Matthew 11 first if
[49:42] that's okay. We're going to go to
[49:44] Matthew 11. Amen. And catch a few verses
[49:49] there. Matthew
[49:50] 11
[49:52] 27-30. Amen.
[49:59] I want to speak to you tonight on a a uh
[50:03] just some as the Lord leads me. It's
[50:05] impossible. It took me 10 10 sessions,
[50:09] 10 services at home to cover this topic.
[50:11] And uh we're only and I'm not a long
[50:14] preacher. So everybody calm down. Just
[50:16] I'm not I've got two services to um to
[50:20] unbburden
[50:21] myself. And uh so we're going to just go
[50:24] through as the Lord leads. And uh I
[50:28] don't even yet know what all I'll say
[50:30] tonight to say nothing of tomorrow if
[50:32] there's a tomorrow. If the rapture comes
[50:35] in the morning, I won't be here tomorrow
[50:37] night. Amen. And I hope you won't be
[50:40] either. That's right. Hallelujah. But
[50:43] we're going to find out tonight that,
[50:45] you know, the Lord has left us a great
[50:47] treasure. And as I've said, you know, a
[50:50] a tremendous price was paid, but you
[50:53] have to avail yourself of it. And uh,
[50:56] Brother Brandham, you know, talks about
[50:57] that all the uh, in many where he said,
[51:01] you know, concerning an overcomer that
[51:04] God's not just going to push you through
[51:05] a pipe. meaning like you know like you'd
[51:07] have a mold and pour something and close
[51:09] the mold and open up taking it take it
[51:11] out in the shape of your mold. So he's
[51:13] not going to use a pipe to shape you.
[51:15] You're going to have to overcome some
[51:17] things. And uh hey did
[51:22] so you know it's my turn. Amen. Amen.
[51:25] Amen. Praise the Lord. that this is
[51:27] exactly why you know when you and I've
[51:30] I've you know when when we teach on
[51:32] things around the world and and I've you
[51:35] know established my church to understand
[51:38] that you know when you read in the Bible
[51:41] and you read about the humanity of the
[51:45] Lord Jesus and the Bible says a lot
[51:47] about his humanity and brother Brandham
[51:49] is really the only one who could really
[51:51] clear it all all the smoke and debris
[51:54] and take all of the ad mixture that man
[51:56] had smeared over the the understanding
[51:59] of the Godhead and took a prophet to
[52:01] really straighten all that out. And um
[52:04] and I'm glad for that. But and that's
[52:07] what gives us the ability to see that,
[52:10] you know, he was a God man. Brother
[52:12] Brandham said, you know, he's not like
[52:14] exactly like Solomon. Solomon was a
[52:17] type. He said, but he's not exactly like
[52:19] Solomon because he said Solomon was just
[52:22] a man. But Jesus was more than a man. He
[52:27] was a man, but he was more than a man.
[52:29] He was a prototype of a brand new kind
[52:31] of human that God was going to build a
[52:34] whole kingdom from. And so he was a man,
[52:37] but he was more than a man. And brother
[52:39] Brandham, to use brother Brandham's
[52:41] exact words, he was man plus.
[52:44] He said Solom, he said Solomon, he was
[52:46] just a man. Amen. So I I I love that.
[52:50] And and when you read about his humanity
[52:52] side, I want you just to remember, just
[52:54] make a mental note that there's nothing
[52:57] when you read about his humanity, God
[52:59] doesn't do that to confuse his bride.
[53:02] Now, that confuses the world. Theology
[53:06] sees three people, Jesus only, two,
[53:09] four, nine, whatever. And uh but and and
[53:13] they're just in blind confusion. And and
[53:16] there are things where you can read
[53:17] about his humanity. And if you use your
[53:20] peanut between your ears and apply human
[53:22] logic, sometimes you're say, "Well, that
[53:25] trinitarian argument uh you know, you'd
[53:27] have to be sympathetic to it if you look
[53:29] at it from logic." Although there's many
[53:31] more that completely and you're just
[53:34] constantly fighting back and forth in
[53:36] front of your mind. And brother Brandon
[53:37] would just say it's the simplest thing
[53:39] in the world. God be lived in a man
[53:41] called Jesus. He created a body, created
[53:43] a blood cell, created an egg and and put
[53:46] and got in that and pushed out arms and
[53:48] legs and came out the God man.
[53:52] So, so you just remember friends when
[53:55] you're looking at his humanity. He
[53:57] doesn't do that to confuse you that
[54:00] that's in the Bible as a road map, as a
[54:04] blueprint for when it would be your turn
[54:06] to be the word made flesh.
[54:09] Amen. That make sense? Yes, sir. So,
[54:12] it's a blueprint. It's a road map. So,
[54:14] you'll know how cuz it's your turn to be
[54:17] the word made flesh. That's what the
[54:19] early church was. Brother Brandon makes
[54:21] that clear. That was the word made flesh
[54:23] in the earth and a many membered bride.
[54:26] Thank you, Lord. Amen. Not preaching on
[54:29] that tonight. That one was free. Amen.
[54:33] But we realize that I said all that to
[54:35] say this that as a man,
[54:38] Jesus, he had to press the battle.
[54:41] That's right. He had to pray constantly.
[54:44] He was tempted in all ways. And you
[54:47] know, he he was he was built out of I
[54:49] mean, he could age. He was built in a
[54:51] body built out of the cursed earth. He
[54:53] could age. He could he could get sick.
[54:55] Physician heal thyself. Brother Brandham
[54:58] uh quotes there I think out of the uh I
[55:00] think um Prince in the House of David I
[55:03] believe that might stand correction
[55:05] where you know Jesus after a big meeting
[55:07] sat on a rock with a pounding headache
[55:08] and and brother Brandham gave credence
[55:10] to to much of that. So hey can I just
[55:13] say this to you tonight and and I want
[55:16] to say this as I lead into my thought.
[55:18] We're all in this thing together.
[55:21] Exactly. We're all in this thing
[55:23] together. That's right. I'm so glad it's
[55:26] that way. Amen. And we're all just going
[55:29] to be honest with each other and with
[55:31] the Lord tonight. And uh the Lord's not
[55:34] going to let you hide. And he didn't let
[55:36] me hide. And uh and so we're just going
[55:39] to we're just going to look at it. And
[55:41] then tonight I'm going to, you know, try
[55:43] to lay some foundation and hit some main
[55:45] points. And then maybe tomorrow uh we'll
[55:48] get preaching. Tonight I'm going to try
[55:49] to stay studious. Now I'm not good at
[55:52] that. I get excited. But so anyway, if I
[55:55] do, I'll get back to I'll get back to to
[55:59] to slow down. Amen. Just just be patient
[56:02] with me. He um Matthew 11, I think I got
[56:06] you that far, right? Amen. Verses 27
[56:12] to30. All things, Jesus speaking, all
[56:15] things are delivered unto me of my
[56:18] father. Now watch this. And no man
[56:21] knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither
[56:25] knoweth any man the Father, save the
[56:27] Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will
[56:33] reveal him.
[56:35] So, you know, Brother Chad and I were
[56:38] fellowshipping around this
[56:39] today. Redemption is locked under a
[56:42] mystery. Paul called it that, the
[56:44] mystery of redemption. There's things in
[56:46] the Bible you can read about how
[56:49] husbands treat wives and wives and
[56:51] children raising families. There's
[56:52] financial advice. There's there's ways
[56:54] to, you know, treat your neighbor.
[56:56] There's there there's you don't even
[56:58] need a revelation for baptism. You can
[57:00] just read. Brother Brandham said
[57:02] concerning the serpent seed, the Bible
[57:04] makes it so plain a 12-year-old child
[57:05] could understand it. So there there's
[57:08] the Bible's filled with stuff like that
[57:10] that just a student comparing verse with
[57:12] verse can decipher and figure out. But
[57:14] when it comes to that book of
[57:16] redemption, that seven sealed book of
[57:18] redemption, that was locked under a
[57:20] mystery of seals. And brother Brandham
[57:22] said it it would take more than a
[57:24] student comparing verse with verse. It's
[57:26] going to take a a prophetic insight,
[57:28] something that the Holy Spirit can speak
[57:30] to through and come out to you because
[57:33] because nobody can understand the
[57:36] mystery of redemption. only he to whom
[57:39] the son will reveal it. And the
[57:42] revelation of it when when it's really a
[57:45] revelation, you're it. You are it.
[57:49] Amen. That that's your revelation. My I
[57:52] I'm not I wasn't uh you know, brother A
[57:55] said, "I found out I'm I wasn't the son
[57:57] of Charles and Ela Brandon." Thank you,
[57:59] Lord. Amen. See, but he had another
[58:02] representation.
[58:04] All right. So, there I go already
[58:06] preaching.
[58:08] All right, let me let me Did we finish?
[58:10] Let me see
[58:12] here. All right, we I want to carry on.
[58:16] Let me read 27 again. All things are
[58:18] delivered unto me of my father. And no
[58:21] man knoweth the Son, but the Father,
[58:24] neither knoweth any man the Father, save
[58:26] the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
[58:30] will reveal him. Now watch here. Here
[58:33] we're going to turn a corner. Come unto
[58:35] me all ye that labor and are heavy
[58:39] laden, and I will give you rest. You
[58:43] wouldn't imagine that when the Lord
[58:46] revealed himself to you, you'd have any
[58:48] labors.
[58:50] That you'd ever get weary, but we do.
[58:53] That's right. Yes, sir. There's a
[58:56] remedy. Come unto me all ye that labor
[58:59] and are heavy laden, and I will give you
[59:03] rest. Now watch. That's the first time.
[59:06] I'll give you rest. Take my yoke upon
[59:09] you and learn of me for I am meek and
[59:13] lowly in heart. Now here it is. He's
[59:16] repeating himself and ye shall find rest
[59:19] unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and
[59:24] my burden is light. Amen. Amen. John
[59:29] 15. Amen. And we'll let you be seated.
[59:32] In fact, as I'll just uh read a couple
[59:34] verses, we'll let you be seated. We'll
[59:36] finish up because we're going to read uh
[59:38] John 15
[59:40] 1-1. John 15:1. I am the true
[59:44] vine and my father is the husbandman.
[59:47] He's the gardener. He's the farmer.
[59:50] Every branch in me that beareth not
[59:52] fruit, he taketh away. And every branch
[59:54] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it that
[59:56] it may bring forth more fruit.
[1:00:00] Father, we ask for your blessing on your
[1:00:03] word. We know there's a blessing in
[1:00:05] reading it. We know there's a blessing
[1:00:07] in hearing it read. So now, may you
[1:00:09] bless us one and all, both speaker and
[1:00:12] hearer. We need to see you, Jesus. These
[1:00:15] are perilous, treacherous times.
[1:00:17] Darkness is covering the world. Gross
[1:00:19] darkness upon the minds of man. It's a
[1:00:22] neurotic age, Lord. It's unprecedented,
[1:00:24] unparalleled. We must see your
[1:00:26] movements. We must see you, Lord. As you
[1:00:28] opened every seal, the living creature
[1:00:30] said, "Come and see." How can we know
[1:00:33] you if we don't see you, Lord? Reveal
[1:00:35] yourself to us tonight. I pray that you
[1:00:38] will have mercy upon us. So, we humble
[1:00:40] ourselves and as a prophet said,
[1:00:42] "Humbled myself." Then I humbled myself
[1:00:45] again. Now, Lord, come, won't you? I'm
[1:00:49] sure you will in Jesus name. Amen. God
[1:00:52] bless you, friends. You can be seated.
[1:01:08] Amen. Now, just give me your undivided
[1:01:11] attention for 55 or 60 minutes and uh
[1:01:15] we'll uh we'll we'll stand on the
[1:01:18] brakes, pull the chute, and we'll get it
[1:01:20] stopped.
[1:01:21] um because I'm not going to I already
[1:01:23] know I can't get to all of it tonight.
[1:01:25] So and and uh and we started a little
[1:01:28] you know later than normal perhaps and
[1:01:31] uh so we want to just go right into it.
[1:01:33] So now let me finish reading in John 15
[1:01:37] verse three. Now ye are clean through
[1:01:39] the word which I have spoken unto you.
[1:01:42] Abide in me and I in you. I'm speaking
[1:01:46] tonight on abiding in Christ. As the
[1:01:49] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:01:52] except it abide in the vine, no more can
[1:01:54] ye except ye abide in me. I am the vine,
[1:01:58] ye are the branches. He that abideth in
[1:02:00] me and I in him. The same bringeth forth
[1:02:03] much fruit. For without me ye can do
[1:02:06] nothing. If a man abide not in me is
[1:02:08] cast forth as a branch, and is withered
[1:02:10] in men, gather them and cast them into
[1:02:12] the fire, and they are burned. If you
[1:02:15] abide in me and my words abide in you,
[1:02:17] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:02:19] be done unto you. Herein is my father
[1:02:23] glorified that you bear much fruit. So
[1:02:27] shall you be my disciples. So he's given
[1:02:29] the the true identity of a true disciple
[1:02:32] who's hitting on all cylinders. It's who
[1:02:34] abides in him and he abides in that
[1:02:36] disciple. Then you can ask what you will
[1:02:38] because then it's not you asking it.
[1:02:40] It's the father asking through you. See,
[1:02:43] that's what brother Brandham found out
[1:02:45] in the in the woods there creating those
[1:02:47] squirrels cuz he never could figure that
[1:02:49] out. How could how could I say to this
[1:02:52] mountain be moved and he and he just he
[1:02:55] was log jammed completely. And the Lord
[1:02:57] was never going to let him, you know,
[1:02:59] just rest in his Baptist theory. He
[1:03:02] thought, well, I'll just tell people,
[1:03:03] you know, if somebody asked me, you
[1:03:05] know, what about what about this? And he
[1:03:07] said, I'll just say, well, that was
[1:03:09] before the atonement. Because brother
[1:03:11] Brandham said everything's got to be in
[1:03:12] the atonement. How how could it be that
[1:03:15] I would say to a mountain be moved? But
[1:03:18] but uh and but brother Brandham said so
[1:03:20] I'll just say I'll just say uh that was
[1:03:23] before the atonement. Which is a pretty
[1:03:25] good Baptist answer, but not one the
[1:03:27] Lord was going to let him get by with.
[1:03:30] And so he takes him in the woods and
[1:03:31] nearly drives him to insanity. And
[1:03:33] brother Brandham is screaming in the
[1:03:35] woods running around like a crazy man.
[1:03:36] He says that and tells it on tape. He
[1:03:38] says, "I I I started yelling out, "Who
[1:03:40] are you? Well, I I don't usually see
[1:03:43] that light. Well, I don't see it. What
[1:03:45] do you want?" Yeah. And and and uh
[1:03:49] dramatic. And he's about to have a
[1:03:51] nervous breakdown. My goodness. He's
[1:03:53] told him, "I'm going to find the
[1:03:54] squirrel. You're going to find it and
[1:03:55] then it's not there." And then, "Oh, it
[1:03:56] must be here. Then it's not there." And
[1:03:58] and uh you know, and he finally has to
[1:04:00] come to terms with the fact. And
[1:04:02] finally, he just comes down and when he
[1:04:04] gets himself quiet enough and he's still
[1:04:07] grappling, but Lord, that's everything's
[1:04:09] got to be in the atonement. How do you
[1:04:11] say I'm going to say to this mountain?
[1:04:13] And the Lord just started talking to him
[1:04:15] and said, "Hey, when you know the
[1:04:18] secrets of people's heart, you think
[1:04:21] that's you doing that? All right. All
[1:04:23] right. When when diseases are cured and
[1:04:26] the and the the blind see and the deaf
[1:04:28] walk and the lame leap uh the the deaf
[1:04:32] have their hearing and the lame walk,
[1:04:34] the dead are raised and you're able to
[1:04:37] tell the future with and go into a
[1:04:39] person's past. You really think that's
[1:04:41] you doing that? And brother Brandham
[1:04:43] said he caught it. He said, "I thought
[1:04:44] no Lord that's not that's you doing
[1:04:46] that." And he said, "I realize that any
[1:04:50] anybody, any believer, any man, any
[1:04:52] woman who's willing, Yes, sir. All
[1:04:54] right. Who would who will live up in
[1:04:57] those atmospheres, those high spheres
[1:04:59] with God, then it wouldn't be you
[1:05:02] thinking it or doing it, it would be the
[1:05:04] mind of Christ flowing through you."
[1:05:08] So, there's a lot to be said about
[1:05:10] abiding in Christ. If ye abide in me and
[1:05:13] my word abide in you, then ask what you
[1:05:15] will. Amen. Hallelujah. So, so now we're
[1:05:19] going next level here. Amen.
[1:05:23] Herein is my father glorified. Amen.
[1:05:26] That you bear much fruit. The whole
[1:05:28] thing bear much fruit. See, so even
[1:05:31] David said, "Lord, if I if if you let me
[1:05:35] die, can I praise you from the grave?
[1:05:37] What good is that? Restore me. Help me.
[1:05:40] Heal me." And the Lord did.
[1:05:42] So God designed you to bring forth much.
[1:05:46] As the father hath loved me, so have I
[1:05:48] loved you. Continue ye in my love. So
[1:05:52] this is all about abiding. Amen. See,
[1:05:55] this is this is beyond the new birth.
[1:05:58] This is about abiding. Jesus doesn't
[1:06:01] abide in someone. That's I mean that's
[1:06:03] the very definition of the new birth is
[1:06:05] that the Holy Spirit is abiding in you.
[1:06:07] Exactly. See, if you keep my
[1:06:11] commandment, you shall abide in my love,
[1:06:12] even as I have kept my father's
[1:06:14] commandment and abide in his love. These
[1:06:17] things I have spoken unto you that my
[1:06:20] joy might remain in you and that your
[1:06:22] joy might be full. Amen. Praise the
[1:06:26] Lord. So this concept of abiding in
[1:06:30] Christ, you know, it it represents one
[1:06:33] of the what I would say is the most
[1:06:36] profound and transformative teachings
[1:06:39] that we have in in all of Christian
[1:06:42] spirituality because it's not merely a
[1:06:45] theological concept as it were, but it's
[1:06:48] actually an essential element that you
[1:06:51] abide in Christ. It is an essential
[1:06:54] element. It is it is that lifegiving
[1:06:57] relationship between Christ and
[1:07:00] believers. And as I've said already,
[1:07:02] it's made possible only by an experience
[1:07:06] of the new birth. Abiding in Christ is
[1:07:09] an active faith. And that's what faith
[1:07:11] is supposed to be. It's not supposed to
[1:07:13] be passive. It's not, okay, you come to
[1:07:16] an altar and the Lord says, "Okay,
[1:07:18] you're saved. See you in the rapture."
[1:07:22] And I and I I I've said to my church
[1:07:25] over the years, it is true we are going
[1:07:28] home on the old ship of Zion, but God
[1:07:30] didn't tell you to go down at the docks
[1:07:33] and sit on your luggage. That's right.
[1:07:36] Your faith is supposed to be active.
[1:07:38] It's supposed to move out.
[1:07:41] I've sent you out as sheep among wolves.
[1:07:44] See,
[1:07:45] so it's an active relationship abiding
[1:07:48] in him daily. It's what it literally
[1:07:51] produces. It It literally manufactures
[1:07:53] spiritual vitality. Uh it builds a
[1:07:57] spiritual shield of protection over your
[1:07:59] mind. It guards your heart. We need
[1:08:01] that.
[1:08:04] Oh my. We need that. It it manufactures
[1:08:07] and I use that word on purpose. It
[1:08:09] literally because brother Brandham talks
[1:08:11] about things that manufacture faith. And
[1:08:14] one of the things that that will
[1:08:15] manufacture faith is desperation.
[1:08:19] And brother Brennham just says it like
[1:08:20] this just to use his words. He says a
[1:08:23] lot of times, you know, we just can't we
[1:08:25] can't get uh the we're not as as
[1:08:28] desperate as we need to be and we can't
[1:08:31] get the faith that we need to have. And
[1:08:33] so God has to put us in a situation and
[1:08:35] make us desperate, then the the faith
[1:08:38] factory turns on. You have faith you
[1:08:40] didn't even know you had. And
[1:08:42] desperation because it's do or die. You
[1:08:44] got to do it. You got to make it. Lord,
[1:08:46] I got to have it. And then suddenly, uh,
[1:08:49] something happens and a prophet many
[1:08:51] times will look out and say, "Sir, you
[1:08:52] didn't know you had that kind of faith,
[1:08:54] did you?" Oh, you got more faith than
[1:08:57] you think you got. You certainly got
[1:08:58] more than the devil wants you to
[1:09:00] believe.
[1:09:03] And you can access it. It's all about
[1:09:05] abiding in Christ and him abiding in
[1:09:07] you.
[1:09:09] Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] See, Brother Ram says it's too bad. It
[1:09:14] has to be but sometimes it takes
[1:09:17] desperation. So as as desperation
[1:09:20] manufactures faith uh abiding in Christ
[1:09:24] manufactures fruitfulness and it manu
[1:09:27] it'll actually produce and reproduce at
[1:09:31] scale and massroduce uh the joys of the
[1:09:35] Lord that Calvary purchased for you as
[1:09:38] we keep repeating at a tremendous price.
[1:09:42] So I just I just say we ought not let it
[1:09:44] sit on the shelf. Amen.
[1:09:47] That's good.
[1:09:53] Many have taken that brave
[1:09:57] step to accept Christ into their lives.
[1:10:02] And as a pastor, and I know ministers
[1:10:05] and pastors are going to relate to what
[1:10:08] I'm talking about because we counsel a
[1:10:10] lot of people and then we ourselves have
[1:10:12] our own things to deal with. Don't think
[1:10:14] we don't. That's right. Brother Bram
[1:10:15] said, "Pray for your pastor." Please do
[1:10:17] that. You have no idea. And there's no
[1:10:20] way you and you can't know. That's why
[1:10:22] pastors don't hold it against you when
[1:10:24] you when you when you think and they can
[1:10:27] just take it. You can just say whatever
[1:10:29] you want to to them. and they're just
[1:10:30] the pastor. They can take it. Somehow
[1:10:31] they got a magic something. And listen,
[1:10:34] they're human beings just like you.
[1:10:38] And sometimes people say the most
[1:10:40] incredible things. I don't know. I guess
[1:10:42] they figure because you're a preacher,
[1:10:43] they have a a privilege they can just
[1:10:45] say it to you and they don't realize.
[1:10:47] And brother Brandham talked about deep
[1:10:48] wounds and scars and things. That's
[1:10:50] right. So, you know, but but but not
[1:10:53] only do we relate to this because of the
[1:10:56] people that we counsel and and a lot of
[1:10:59] times, you know, we have to go to the
[1:11:00] Lord. We don't have a counselor per se.
[1:11:02] We got friends. We've got close pastors
[1:11:05] and and you might have two or three in
[1:11:07] your whole life that you can just sit
[1:11:08] down and open your heart to. And then
[1:11:11] even them, there's things you would
[1:11:12] never say. And the only counselor you
[1:11:14] have is the Lord who understands. And I
[1:11:17] want to say to you tonight, he
[1:11:19] understands. Tell him about it. Just
[1:11:21] tell him about it. You can't hide it
[1:11:24] from him anyway. Just tell him about it.
[1:11:26] He wants to hear it. Get on your knees.
[1:11:29] Lift up your hands. Say, "Lord, I got a
[1:11:31] problem."
[1:11:33] That's right. Amen. These are trying
[1:11:35] times. God has placed you here on
[1:11:38] purpose with great forethought and
[1:11:41] intent. Yes, sir. Uh he's placed you in
[1:11:44] the darkest age in human history. He's
[1:11:46] placed you in what brother Brandham saw
[1:11:48] as an impossible darkness and yet here
[1:11:51] we are
[1:11:53] still standing
[1:11:56] and a lot of times many many of God's
[1:11:59] family and I want to say it that way
[1:12:00] tonight. I know there's compound meaning
[1:12:02] and there's places where I'm not dis
[1:12:04] discarding the fact that that you know
[1:12:07] Jesus talks about that these are cast
[1:12:09] into the fire and you know whatever
[1:12:11] doesn't bring forth as you know if I'm
[1:12:12] not preaching the other side of it
[1:12:14] there's there's compound meetings and
[1:12:15] everything I'm only taking one side of
[1:12:17] it tonight and I'm not even taking the
[1:12:19] side I'm not here preaching tonight
[1:12:21] necessarily to unbelievers if you're an
[1:12:23] unbeliever in Christ hopefully what I'll
[1:12:25] say tonight will break your heart and
[1:12:27] make you want to love the Lord but I'm
[1:12:29] preaching to believers tonight. I want
[1:12:31] that in the front of your mind. I'm
[1:12:34] believing that you're a believer. I'm
[1:12:37] preaching this through the through the
[1:12:39] lens of I've got a house full of people
[1:12:42] who love the Lord. Believe the word. Say
[1:12:45] amen to every word. Repent when they're
[1:12:48] wrong. Repent if they offend. Get up and
[1:12:51] keep going. Amen.
[1:12:55] So, so if I say that that many of us
[1:12:58] have taken this brave step, we've all
[1:13:00] taken that brave step
[1:13:03] to accept Christ into our lives. And
[1:13:06] yet, too often, friends, let's be honest
[1:13:08] with one another, real honest tonight.
[1:13:11] too often that we find even among God's
[1:13:15] family, we hear expressed the expression
[1:13:19] of feelings um of weariness and and and
[1:13:23] even disappointment and not not of not
[1:13:26] in God, of course, but in ourselves.
[1:13:28] Amen.
[1:13:30] It's true. Yes, sir. It can be
[1:13:32] disheartening. And I'm I'm I'm granting
[1:13:35] it to you. I'm saying it's not unnormal.
[1:13:39] Don't let the devil lie to you. It's not
[1:13:40] unnormal. We all go through it. It can
[1:13:43] be disheartening when the joy and the
[1:13:46] blessings that you once felt seem to
[1:13:50] fade over time, often leaving you, yep,
[1:13:55] I'm going to say it. Often leaving even
[1:13:57] a born again child of God to question
[1:14:00] their very experience.
[1:14:04] sometimes and you you know you're you
[1:14:07] know you wonder you know with your
[1:14:10] experience with such a such a savior
[1:14:14] such a savior that is so wonderful and
[1:14:17] and sometimes you can find yourself at
[1:14:19] such a lowb that you you you wonder why
[1:14:22] your experience with such a wonderful
[1:14:25] lord such a wonderful savior hasn't been
[1:14:28] perhaps as fulfilling
[1:14:31] as you had hoped It would be
[1:14:37] Satan can take you down a
[1:14:39] road with such a feeling of inadequacy.
[1:14:43] Amen. You wonder at times why the Lord
[1:14:46] even called you in the first place.
[1:14:50] That's true. Say, "Brother Jason,
[1:14:53] uh, this is going dark. I don't want I
[1:14:55] come to church to to worship the Lord."
[1:14:59] Well, you know, can I just say
[1:15:01] something, friends? I've been there.
[1:15:04] You've been there.
[1:15:06] I I may not stand here tonight and feel
[1:15:08] particularly there, but you might. And
[1:15:10] maybe the Lord has burdened my heart for
[1:15:13] you tonight. And I and but I will say
[1:15:16] this, that that there have been times,
[1:15:18] and I'll just be very transparent. There
[1:15:20] have been times in my life where where,
[1:15:22] you know, I can say, I wonder why he
[1:15:24] called me in the first place. had it not
[1:15:27] been for a firm belief in a first place
[1:15:32] that was a place before this place so
[1:15:36] that this place doesn't count against
[1:15:38] that place so that I had a heavenly
[1:15:41] position in his mind and I realized that
[1:15:45] there's no earthly condition that can
[1:15:47] undo that heavenly position
[1:15:52] a place in the mind of God before I was
[1:15:55] in this place, a place where I didn't
[1:15:58] fall, a place where I agree with every
[1:16:00] word. Oh, if not for that
[1:16:03] assuring revelation. Hallelujah. That's
[1:16:06] right. You and I would have faced
[1:16:09] impossible discouragement.
[1:16:13] Yes, sir. I'm glad tonight to know. I'm
[1:16:16] glad to hear these amens. I'm glad to
[1:16:18] hear you saying, "Yep, that's right. Me,
[1:16:20] too. Come on, sir. I'm glad to know that
[1:16:24] I'm not the only one who has
[1:16:26] wept before the Lord. Hallelujah. For
[1:16:29] dilatory ways and failures and sometimes
[1:16:32] repeated failures and sometimes repeats
[1:16:35] of the repeat.
[1:16:40] Godl,
[1:16:42] you know you do. That's not You're not
[1:16:45] fooling yourself or anybody. You
[1:16:46] actually really do. You know you love
[1:16:48] God. You believe that that you were in
[1:16:52] that first place. You believe in a first
[1:16:55] place and you believe you were in that
[1:16:56] first place. You're very grateful. You
[1:16:59] truly are very grateful deep in your
[1:17:02] heart sincerely. Amen. You're grateful
[1:17:05] for the word he's revealed to you. And
[1:17:08] you believe it and you long for more of
[1:17:11] it and you long for victory in it.
[1:17:15] Yes, sir.
[1:17:17] Thank you, sir. But all too
[1:17:20] often you find yourself coming up
[1:17:23] heartbreakingly short of the glory of
[1:17:26] God. The
[1:17:27] glory that he so richly deserves. And
[1:17:31] the rub is that you know it.
[1:17:35] You painfully know it.
[1:17:40] I want to say to you tonight, and it's
[1:17:43] important for you to
[1:17:45] understand that those failures and even
[1:17:49] if they're repeated and those
[1:17:51] discouragements and those times when
[1:17:53] your faith feels anything but active,
[1:17:57] I just want you to know something,
[1:17:58] friends. The Holy Spirit, I told my
[1:18:01] church at home, the Holy Spirit is on me
[1:18:03] to say, and I feel the same again
[1:18:05] tonight. That is not a reflection of
[1:18:09] your worth to him. And it is and our
[1:18:12] failures are not a reflection of our
[1:18:15] true faith in him. I got them. You got
[1:18:18] them. But I'm a believer.
[1:18:24] That's right. That's right. I want to
[1:18:26] give you this assurance tonight. He who
[1:18:29] began a good work in you
[1:18:32] will
[1:18:34] finish it. Yes,
[1:18:41] praise the Lord. That's right. This is
[1:18:42] why you abide in him and he abides in
[1:18:46] you because this is actually a kingdom
[1:18:49] principle, not just at the last day.
[1:18:51] It's it's rather more important, the
[1:18:54] most important in the last days, but
[1:18:56] it's a it's a principle, a kingdom
[1:18:58] principle covering all the ages. All the
[1:19:01] ages. All down through time. his family,
[1:19:04] you know, his his family either achieved
[1:19:07] and did great exploits. The Bible says
[1:19:09] concerning the the last days that the
[1:19:12] people of the last days will know their
[1:19:13] God and those are the ones who will do
[1:19:15] great exploits.
[1:19:17] And God's family has always uh performed
[1:19:21] by being a a a usable vessel for God.
[1:19:24] Great exploits, things that no human
[1:19:26] could do, things way way above their uh
[1:19:30] their their weight class, no way to
[1:19:32] accomplish it, impossible situations.
[1:19:34] Paul goes down the list, you know, and
[1:19:37] uh but then sometimes, you know, we they
[1:19:39] did great exploits, but then sometimes
[1:19:41] they they lost battles. And and I'm not
[1:19:45] saying that I know we have trials and
[1:19:47] tribulations. I get that. But it's a
[1:19:50] different thing when you lose a battle
[1:19:52] you need not have lost.
[1:19:57] When you suffer humiliation that you
[1:20:00] need not have had to suffer.
[1:20:03] So this heavenly principle is is so
[1:20:07] vital. This is why Jesus is is telling
[1:20:10] it to us. Th this principle is is
[1:20:13] completely organic. It's probably it's I
[1:20:16] would say it's the most living principle
[1:20:18] in all of the word of God because it's
[1:20:22] literally a life. It's his life. It's
[1:20:24] the life of the creator living through
[1:20:26] you. You're a conduit of the life of
[1:20:29] Jehovah.
[1:20:32] Yes, sir. This is it is it is abiding.
[1:20:36] It is in your abiding in Christ. Yes,
[1:20:40] sir. We're not talking about a new
[1:20:42] birth. This is after the new birth. See,
[1:20:46] and because he's abiding in you and
[1:20:48] you're abiding in him, but Jesus is is
[1:20:50] is naming all kinds of conditions. I
[1:20:53] need you to abide because this is how my
[1:20:56] father gets glorified. I I need you to
[1:20:59] abide so that you can ask what you will
[1:21:01] in my name, and I'll do it.
[1:21:04] See, th this this is this is important
[1:21:07] because as my born again child, you're
[1:21:09] going to need to do this so that my
[1:21:12] confidence and love in you uh is not is
[1:21:15] not questioned and your joy can remain.
[1:21:20] Hallelujah. God needs to know he can
[1:21:22] trust you.
[1:21:24] Now, that's a weird way to say it
[1:21:26] because he's omnisient.
[1:21:29] But he was omnisient when he took
[1:21:31] Abraham up up Mariah and told him to
[1:21:35] sacrifice his son. And brother Brandham
[1:21:36] said he laid him down. And he took that
[1:21:39] knife. And brother Brandham said he
[1:21:40] raised that knife and he said he was
[1:21:42] just as determined to plunge that knife
[1:21:44] into the breast of his son. He said, as
[1:21:46] I am to lift up my Bible. Amen. And the
[1:21:50] spirit of God caught him. This wasn't no
[1:21:52] joke. He was serious. He was going to do
[1:21:53] it. Now, it seems humanly impossible,
[1:21:56] but Paul deciphered it. Paul Paul caught
[1:22:00] the the unencrypted information, and
[1:22:02] Paul said, "Well, here's what happened."
[1:22:04] Abraham thought, I love it how a prophet
[1:22:07] can go back and discern the thoughts of
[1:22:09] somebody that lived thousands of years
[1:22:11] before him.
[1:22:13] And he said, "Here's what here's what
[1:22:14] Abraham concluded that, well, the Lord
[1:22:17] gave him to me. That was impossible. I
[1:22:20] already couldn't have got him here. I
[1:22:21] can't keep him here. God's already said
[1:22:24] he's going to represent a a seed line
[1:22:26] that's as as numerous as the stars. I
[1:22:30] want him to be able to count it. And and
[1:22:32] and and so he said, I I just figure that
[1:22:35] if I do kill him, he'll have to
[1:22:36] resurrect him. So even before he goes up
[1:22:39] the mountain, he says to the servants,
[1:22:40] you stay here. I and this boy will go
[1:22:42] and don't worry, me and this boy will
[1:22:44] come back.
[1:22:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:49] And he raises his knife to plunge it in.
[1:22:51] And quickly, Abraham, Abraham, touch not
[1:22:53] the lad.
[1:22:55] And and it's curious. The Bible says,
[1:22:57] "For now I know." God says to him, God
[1:22:59] says, "For now I know."
[1:23:02] That you'll you will believe me. And I
[1:23:05] just thought to myself, you think
[1:23:06] there's something God didn't know?
[1:23:09] I'm here today, friends. God already
[1:23:11] knew that Abraham would do it. But
[1:23:14] Abraham needed to know Abraham would do
[1:23:17] it. Abraham. Sometimes you get in a
[1:23:20] situation and God has you there so that
[1:23:23] you know, I know my redeemer liveth. I
[1:23:26] know I'm a believer. I know I'm not
[1:23:29] going back. I'm never going to give up.
[1:23:31] I'm going to keep fighting again and
[1:23:33] again and again.
[1:23:36] It doesn't matter what the devil does.
[1:23:38] If I fail tomorrow, I'll get up again.
[1:23:44] So God does these things so that we can
[1:23:46] know. That's it. When push comes to
[1:23:49] shove,
[1:23:56] that's it. It is in abiding. It is in in
[1:24:00] the
[1:24:01] effort of
[1:24:02] abiding that you ask what you will. It
[1:24:05] is in the labor of abiding. Yes, sir.
[1:24:09] See, and so this is exactly
[1:24:13] why we went to to the book of Matthew
[1:24:17] because he says, "Come unto me." This is
[1:24:20] his family. All you that are weary or
[1:24:22] and heavy laden. I'll give you rest.
[1:24:24] Rest is the Holy Ghost. See, but then
[1:24:27] notice what he says. Now you come unto
[1:24:31] me, I'm going to give you rest. I'm
[1:24:33] going to give you the rest.
[1:24:35] Now that you have that, now take my yoke
[1:24:40] upon you. That's it. Learn of me.
[1:24:45] Now, now start. You're in school now.
[1:24:47] Start learning. Start growing. Start
[1:24:49] maturing. Learn of me. Learn of me.
[1:24:52] Learn of me. Be active. Go forward.
[1:24:55] Abide in me. I'll abide in you. And when
[1:24:58] you do that, then he comes down and
[1:25:01] repeats it. Then you'll find rest for
[1:25:03] your soul. That's next level rest. All
[1:25:05] right. That's not the rest of the new
[1:25:07] birth. You already got that. That's next
[1:25:09] level rest. I want next level rest.
[1:25:12] Amen.
[1:25:14] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:25:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. This is I mean it
[1:25:19] isn't it is this kind of a life. Listen
[1:25:21] friends, that's where you learn to play
[1:25:23] the sheet music. Yes sir. that the great
[1:25:27] composer has pinned and the great he's
[1:25:30] got a great conductor and there's a Holy
[1:25:32] Spirit and he sent us a prophet and
[1:25:34] we've got a message and all we're and
[1:25:37] you're gifted. You're called you're
[1:25:38] chosen to play an instrument and the
[1:25:41] instrument you're playing is your faith
[1:25:43] and your dedication and your
[1:25:45] consecration and your sincerity until
[1:25:47] your whole life becomes a life song that
[1:25:50] is played back to God that he wants to
[1:25:53] hear. Your life is playing a music.
[1:26:00] Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. Your
[1:26:02] life becomes a life song to the Lord.
[1:26:07] This this this element is is dependent
[1:26:10] in nature and it's it's vital for
[1:26:14] believers to be in relationship with
[1:26:17] Christ.
[1:26:19] As we already read the words of the
[1:26:21] Lord, a branch cannot
[1:26:24] survive separated from the vine.
[1:26:28] True. That's right. You're a believer.
[1:26:30] You're a child of God. But if if you
[1:26:33] have if you have so ordered your life
[1:26:36] that separates you from your Bibles,
[1:26:40] your tapes, your church attendance, your
[1:26:44] fellowship, say, "Well, it connected me
[1:26:46] to a lot of money." That's going to ash
[1:26:48] and cinder. Exactly right. That's right.
[1:26:52] That's going to ash and cinder. That
[1:26:54] there there's nothing that can save the
[1:26:56] world. All their gold and all their
[1:26:57] money. It's going to ash and cinder. And
[1:26:59] this I'm going to tell you something,
[1:27:01] friends. You need to re recalculate your
[1:27:03] investment strategy.
[1:27:06] I want to I want to know what's really
[1:27:08] important in my life. Amen. That's
[1:27:11] right. Yes, sir. You can't survive
[1:27:14] separated from the vine. And neither can
[1:27:16] believers thrive spiritually. They're
[1:27:20] believers, but they can't thrive
[1:27:21] spiritually apart
[1:27:23] from connection to Christ.
[1:27:27] It's distinct from the new birth. It's
[1:27:29] uh I it's essential and and it's much
[1:27:32] needed growth, you know, when you've
[1:27:34] come to know the Lord. So So it's, you
[1:27:38] know, it we we know it as a gene of God
[1:27:41] before the foundation of the world.
[1:27:44] Amen.
[1:27:45] And by the way, that's there's only
[1:27:48] three places in the scripture. First,
[1:27:50] Peter talks about it. John talks about
[1:27:53] it in the 17th chapter, which is my
[1:27:56] favorite chapter in in the in the book
[1:27:58] of John, probably in all the gospels.
[1:28:00] And then Paul talks about it
[1:28:02] in so Peter's talking about Christ. And
[1:28:06] you remember uh you were you were bought
[1:28:08] with the precious blood of Christ as a
[1:28:10] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[1:28:13] spot who verilely was for ordained
[1:28:16] before
[1:28:18] the foundation of the world. See
[1:28:20] everywhere else when it's somebody not
[1:28:22] Christ or not his bride because John 17
[1:28:26] father I will that they also whom thou
[1:28:28] hast given me be with me. Now it's
[1:28:30] Christ and his family together that
[1:28:32] they'll be with me that they may behold
[1:28:35] my glory which thou has given me for
[1:28:37] thou lovest me before the foundation of
[1:28:39] the world. And now I love them the same
[1:28:40] way. That's right. And then when Paul
[1:28:43] comes to Ephesians 1 according as he
[1:28:45] hath chosen us in him before the
[1:28:47] foundation of the world. Here's why he
[1:28:49] chose us. So that we would be holy and
[1:28:51] without blame before him in love. That's
[1:28:53] right. See? But any other time where
[1:28:56] you're talking about like the remnant of
[1:28:58] the woman seed, the tribulation saints
[1:28:59] that are saved, any other time, it's
[1:29:02] always since the foundation of the world
[1:29:04] because it begins at time or from the
[1:29:05] time they're born. And and and even the
[1:29:08] foolish virgin who receive eternal life
[1:29:10] because they were saints.
[1:29:13] That means sanctified one. They were
[1:29:15] righteous people. The king called them
[1:29:17] righteous in Matthew 25. That's right.
[1:29:19] the and they said to the to the king,
[1:29:21] the righteous said to the king, the king
[1:29:23] said to the righteous. That's right. And
[1:29:25] so so you see them standing there uh in
[1:29:28] Revelation 14 on Mount Zion. And with
[1:29:31] the 144,000, they're going in different
[1:29:33] directions because 144,000 were born
[1:29:35] again, become part of the first
[1:29:37] resurrection. But these unwanted of the
[1:29:40] woman's seed uh is not in the
[1:29:41] millennium. She comes up after the
[1:29:43] millennium and she's granted eternal
[1:29:45] life. And he says to her, "Enter into
[1:29:48] the joys of the Lord prepared for you
[1:29:50] since the foundation of the world, not
[1:29:52] before." It says in the book of
[1:29:54] Revelation, multiple places, all shall
[1:29:56] worship the beast whose names are not in
[1:29:58] the book of the book of life of the lamb
[1:30:00] since the foundation of the world. But
[1:30:03] there's a very small category of Jesus
[1:30:07] or Jesus and his bride or just his
[1:30:09] bride. And you were you were in Christ
[1:30:13] before the foundation of the world.
[1:30:18] That's right.
[1:30:21] See, praise the Lord. Amen. So, it can
[1:30:24] only be something after the new birth.
[1:30:26] And and and of course, we already know
[1:30:29] that that John 5:24 assures us that that
[1:30:34] once you've passed from death to life,
[1:30:35] you can never lose that. That's right.
[1:30:38] So, so, so then it, so then if it, if
[1:30:41] it's only to the born again and then
[1:30:44] it's to those who John 15 who are those
[1:30:48] who can't lose that, then it can only be
[1:30:51] speaking about the level of relationship
[1:30:54] that a bornagain believer maintains in
[1:30:58] Christ. Amen. That's it. See, so this
[1:31:02] clarifies why your redemption is
[1:31:04] permanent.
[1:31:06] So, so, so the but so it's the quality
[1:31:09] see your your redemption is permanent
[1:31:12] but the quality of relationship
[1:31:16] can fluctuate based on the believer's
[1:31:18] commitment to abiding.
[1:31:21] Now, Satan knows this. He knows he can't
[1:31:24] unborn again you.
[1:31:28] Somebody apologize to the king for
[1:31:30] slaughtering his English.
[1:31:33] Satan knows he can't he can't, you know,
[1:31:36] take away the life of God. That's never
[1:31:38] ended well for him when he's tried that.
[1:31:41] But and we maybe go a little more in
[1:31:42] that direction tomorrow. But but but the
[1:31:44] bottom but so what he does is is he
[1:31:48] bombards you and with every kind of
[1:31:51] things that you could ever imagine and
[1:31:53] things you can't imagine and just fills
[1:31:55] up your life with stuff.
[1:31:59] and he takes you here and he takes you
[1:32:00] there and the next thing you know you
[1:32:02] haven't prayed in a while and you
[1:32:03] haven't read your Bible. You feel dry.
[1:32:05] You know you're a believer. What's wrong
[1:32:07] with me? You need to come back and begin
[1:32:09] abiding in the vine.
[1:32:13] That's right. Yes, sir. We've
[1:32:16] established that it's your it's your
[1:32:18] daily lived voice. It's your
[1:32:20] consecration. It's your sincerity. It's
[1:32:23] your dedication. And all of this can be
[1:32:25] summed up in two words. divine
[1:32:27] relationship, divine fellowship.
[1:32:31] Brother Chad and I were talking about
[1:32:32] that today. Brother Chad talking about
[1:32:34] how that God there and going back from
[1:32:37] brother Brandham's teaching. You know,
[1:32:38] God already had worship. He didn't
[1:32:41] create Adam and Eve for worship. He
[1:32:43] already had worship. The angels already
[1:32:44] worshiped him. What he didn't have was
[1:32:46] fellowship with a like being. That's
[1:32:48] right. So he wanted to create something
[1:32:50] in his own image, something that would
[1:32:52] be kin that he could be kin to and have
[1:32:55] his kingdom through the ceaseless ages.
[1:32:58] Someone in his own image expressed from
[1:33:01] within him to be to be a further
[1:33:04] expression of him. And that's really the
[1:33:08] the whole mystery of the godhead. And
[1:33:12] brother Brandham said some jaw-dropping
[1:33:15] things about that. And I don't have time
[1:33:17] to go down that rabbit trail tonight.
[1:33:19] You know, Brother Brandham, one of the
[1:33:21] things that he talks about and and this
[1:33:23] is directly off the tape when he's
[1:33:25] referring to the bornagain family of God
[1:33:29] that that that any and he says anyone
[1:33:32] that's in that situation,
[1:33:35] uh, they're part of God's godhead.
[1:33:37] That's right. That's direct quote. Part
[1:33:39] of God's Godhead. Look it up. Part of
[1:33:41] God's Godhead. Amen. See, and so so we
[1:33:44] realize that when you and that makes
[1:33:46] sense to us because the bride, you know,
[1:33:48] was not simply um so there are things
[1:33:52] that God creates
[1:33:55] temporarily. For instance, hell,
[1:33:58] right? It's not eternal. Brother, he
[1:34:00] stood the theologians on their ear with
[1:34:02] that one. Oh yeah, it is. It's eternal.
[1:34:04] He said, well, how could it be eternal?
[1:34:05] If you if you could burn eternal, then
[1:34:07] you got eternal life. Right.
[1:34:09] And then there's only one form of
[1:34:11] eternal life, and that's God. And then
[1:34:12] if you had God's life, you wouldn't be
[1:34:13] in hell in the first place.
[1:34:16] I love Kentucky logic, man. It just I
[1:34:20] love it. See, they they couldn't drag
[1:34:23] him out
[1:34:25] into that deep water and give him all
[1:34:27] kinds of, you know, Greek and Hebrew and
[1:34:29] crisscross him up. He'd just stay right
[1:34:31] around in the shallow. Always believe
[1:34:32] Christ.
[1:34:36] He and you know he said, "Well, why'd he
[1:34:37] stick with that?" But you know why he
[1:34:38] says he says why he stuck with that? He
[1:34:41] told his mama on her deathbed, "You
[1:34:43] know, mama, I just never could see some
[1:34:45] of the things that were taught out
[1:34:46] there. I just believe the Bible and and
[1:34:49] the way it was written." And and guess
[1:34:51] what? I got the same results they got.
[1:34:55] So why wouldn't he believe the Bible the
[1:34:57] way it's written? Let them argue till
[1:34:59] the cows come home. I don't care about
[1:35:01] their arguments. I can get the same
[1:35:03] results they got. All right. Hallelujah.
[1:35:07] That's right. Yes, sir. See, so so the
[1:35:09] so he creates hell for the devil and his
[1:35:12] angels. Someday it'll be it'll be done
[1:35:13] away with. It's not eternal. It's not an
[1:35:15] expression. The earth is an eternal
[1:35:18] attribute. It can never be annihilated.
[1:35:20] See? So, so brother Brandham talks about
[1:35:22] paper. He said you can't annihilate
[1:35:24] anything. He said you can burn it. You
[1:35:26] can take a piece of paper. You can burn
[1:35:28] it. He said, "But you have now you've
[1:35:30] destroyed it, but you haven't
[1:35:31] annihilated it cuz all you did was send
[1:35:33] it back to its elements and gases that
[1:35:35] it was before it was a tree which then
[1:35:38] got manufactured, which then got turned
[1:35:40] into paper." And brother Brandham says,
[1:35:41] "If time would go on long enough, the
[1:35:43] cycle of life could bring it back around
[1:35:45] again. It could end up being another
[1:35:46] tree, get reh harvested again, come back
[1:35:49] to a sheet of paper again." And you say,
[1:35:52] "Well, that's that's a wonderful thing."
[1:35:53] Not when it comes to putting my sins in
[1:35:55] the sea of forgetfulness forever. I
[1:35:58] don't ever want them to be able to come
[1:35:59] back when I'm on the other side in a
[1:36:02] glorified body. I don't want to that can
[1:36:04] go back once I get over there. I don't
[1:36:07] want to ever have to go through this
[1:36:08] again.
[1:36:10] So, he didn't just create a bride like a
[1:36:13] companion like speaker right here in
[1:36:14] front of him. He expressed her. She's an
[1:36:18] eternal attribute. She can never pass
[1:36:21] away. No more die than God could die cuz
[1:36:23] she she's a part of him. Hallelujah.
[1:36:26] Amen.
[1:36:28] Praise God. Th this is the privilege of
[1:36:30] the bride. Now, do you want to abide?
[1:36:34] Praise God. That's why brother Brandham
[1:36:36] would say make that to me three most
[1:36:38] profound words in all the message.
[1:36:40] That's right. And that's a blows fuses.
[1:36:44] She is him. And of course, you realize
[1:36:47] brother Brandham when he comes and he
[1:36:49] he's preaching shalom, preaches who is
[1:36:51] MelzDC, he he preaches the, you know, uh
[1:36:54] the God in simplicity. He preaches the
[1:36:57] revelation of Jesus Christ. All of these
[1:36:58] different things, the the the invisible
[1:37:01] union and and he's he's showing how all
[1:37:03] this comes together. And so, so you
[1:37:05] realize that when he's saying she is
[1:37:08] him, he's not saying she's literally
[1:37:10] him. I mean, I didn't die for you. You
[1:37:12] don't pray to me. You understand? But
[1:37:15] Hebrews 13:8, which was the theme of his
[1:37:18] ministry, it was on his tents. Hebrews
[1:37:21] 13:8 is the key that unlocks the
[1:37:23] mystery. She's the same as him. All
[1:37:26] right. See? So, so, so she's the same as
[1:37:31] him. She's not literally him. She is
[1:37:33] him. Uh, but because she's an expression
[1:37:36] of him. She's the That's how you
[1:37:39] identify the bride from the church
[1:37:41] because they have the image of the word
[1:37:43] that they bear.
[1:37:46] Which which goes beyond their testimony.
[1:37:48] their testimony that they're a Christian
[1:37:50] doesn't save them because their life
[1:37:52] doesn't match the sheet music.
[1:37:56] And we're not talking about wins and
[1:37:58] losses. It's not you can't even earn
[1:37:59] eternal life like that. That that that
[1:38:02] that's why that God disqualified Satan's
[1:38:05] lawsuit when he tries to sue God in in
[1:38:07] in God's heavenly court. You're talking
[1:38:10] about the audacity. Go read Ezekiel 3.
[1:38:12] And and here comes Satan. And he brings
[1:38:14] in Joshua the high priest. He's bringing
[1:38:16] the high priest because he represents
[1:38:18] all of Israel. And God had already said,
[1:38:21] "They're my people." And now that Satan
[1:38:23] has said, "Look here, I got evidence
[1:38:25] that they're secret sinners and they're
[1:38:27] adulterers and they're idolattors and
[1:38:29] they they they hide behind trees and and
[1:38:32] and eat things sacrificed." And you and
[1:38:34] you said and you said they were your
[1:38:35] people and you said they were the apple
[1:38:38] of your eye and you said you chose them.
[1:38:40] I'm here to tell you your word has
[1:38:42] failed. You need to come down off the
[1:38:43] throne. Let me have it. Oh, I'm here to
[1:38:46] tell you, the Lord stepped from that
[1:38:48] throne and he stepped out of eternity
[1:38:51] and he said, "Let me tell you something.
[1:38:53] I'm going to dismiss your case on one
[1:38:56] premise alone. I don't care what
[1:38:59] evidence you've got. I don't care what
[1:39:01] actuality you can prove. Is not this
[1:39:04] Jerusalem whom I have chosen. Is not
[1:39:07] this people? Do you not realize that
[1:39:10] there is now therefore no condemnation
[1:39:13] even possible to them who are in Christ?
[1:39:17] [Applause]
[1:39:18] This is my Jerusalem. These are my
[1:39:21] people. That's right.
[1:39:24] The case was dismissed just on that.
[1:39:28] The Lord didn't argue.
[1:39:31] See,
[1:39:33] so so anything that had a beginning
[1:39:36] would have an ending. So he didn't do it
[1:39:38] that way. And so you know um a a prophet
[1:39:42] even you know he goes there to the
[1:39:44] example of of Christ at Calvary you know
[1:39:46] just like Eve came out of the side of
[1:39:48] Adam and they opened the side of Jesus
[1:39:50] and he said the bride came out. Say what
[1:39:52] does that even mean? Brother Brandham
[1:39:54] says when they took that Roman spear and
[1:39:57] shoved it into his heart. Brother
[1:39:59] Brandham tells us on tape that the tip
[1:40:02] of that spear pierced that original
[1:40:06] blood cell, that original spoken word,
[1:40:11] he still had that in him. Although he
[1:40:14] was dead, completely dead, that blood
[1:40:17] cell of life was still inside there. And
[1:40:20] when that pierced that blood cell, out
[1:40:22] came the life of God. and and he
[1:40:25] descended and and emptied out and then
[1:40:28] ascended and then sent that life back
[1:40:30] onto his church again.
[1:40:34] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:40:37] So certainly
[1:40:40] so all things are delivered to me of my
[1:40:43] father. He had said in Matthew 11. I
[1:40:45] gota I gotta stop. Let me let me let me
[1:40:48] come down and catch this one point.
[1:40:55] So all things are delivered unto me of
[1:40:58] my father, and no man knoweth the son,
[1:41:01] but the father, neither knoweth any man
[1:41:03] the father save the son, and he to
[1:41:06] whomsoever the son will reveal him.
[1:41:09] Amen. See, so so he when he comes down
[1:41:12] to say, "Come unto me all ye that labor
[1:41:17] and are heavy laden, and I will give you
[1:41:20] rest.
[1:41:22] Then take my yoke upon you. Learn of me,
[1:41:27] for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye
[1:41:29] shall find rest unto your souls. For my
[1:41:33] yoke is easy. Amen. And my burden is
[1:41:35] light. So you see friends, every day you
[1:41:39] you should be reaching for a higher
[1:41:41] handhold on this mountain that we are
[1:41:43] climbing. Are you climbing it tonight?
[1:41:46] Every day you should be reaching for a
[1:41:48] higher handhold. Christ in you, the hope
[1:41:52] of glory. How many are climbing to Mount
[1:41:54] Zion? Hallelujah. And so the mind of
[1:41:57] Christ, you know, that that that it has
[1:42:00] to be appropriated. It has to be
[1:42:03] assimilated deep inside your being. You
[1:42:05] have to take ownership of it. Uh you
[1:42:08] know, and and and and and this is this
[1:42:11] is where brother Brandon would bring his
[1:42:13] thought, fellowship by redemption. See,
[1:42:17] so we're not even just talking about
[1:42:19] basic salvation from destruction. The
[1:42:21] brother Brandham said that and that was
[1:42:23] a a question they asked him in COD.
[1:42:25] Brother Brandham, why you sounds like
[1:42:27] you're saying the foolish virgin gets
[1:42:28] saved in the tribulation, but we thought
[1:42:30] you said no one gets saved in
[1:42:31] tribulation. And brother Brandham just
[1:42:33] says, well, the confusion is because of
[1:42:36] what I've taught about them not getting
[1:42:38] saved in the tribulation. He said,
[1:42:40] they're already saved. See, but they're
[1:42:43] rejected in the bride. They have to go
[1:42:45] into the tribulation for their sin of
[1:42:46] unbelief and rejecting the message. Yes,
[1:42:48] sir. See, so they're not born again.
[1:42:51] They arrive there not born again, but
[1:42:53] they were righteous, sanctified people
[1:42:55] who believed God. You see that in the
[1:42:57] Old Testament, too. That's who Lot stood
[1:42:59] for. Uh although Lot was willing to live
[1:43:02] in Sodom, he lifted up his eyes and the
[1:43:04] fertile plains attracted his attention
[1:43:06] and it got him to live there and he
[1:43:08] almost lost everything and ended up in
[1:43:10] disgrace. But he had a right. It vexed
[1:43:12] his righteous soul. See, I mean, Aimilec
[1:43:16] was never going to get the revelation
[1:43:17] Abraham got. He was not called under
[1:43:20] under Abraham, but Aimilec was a
[1:43:22] righteous man. And God saved his life.
[1:43:24] And he said, "Lord, you know the
[1:43:25] integrity of my heart." And the Lord did
[1:43:27] know. So, you've got that brother says,
[1:43:29] "A remnant in every age." So, so we
[1:43:32] realize that there is salvation from
[1:43:34] destruction, but redemption is next
[1:43:36] level, friends. That's something you had
[1:43:38] to previously own and you buy it back
[1:43:40] and take possession of it. Oh, the next
[1:43:43] time you're the devil's got you
[1:43:45] graveling around and you don't feel like
[1:43:46] you're worth anything, you just
[1:43:48] remember, I I didn't start here. I'm not
[1:43:51] finishing here. I came from God and I'm
[1:43:54] going back to God. And there ain't
[1:43:55] enough devils in all of hell that can
[1:43:57] stop it.
[1:44:01] Hallelujah. Amen. So, it's fellowship in
[1:44:04] this redemption. redemption
[1:44:07] and and as you're redeemed there's a
[1:44:09] fellowship and without our willingness
[1:44:11] and our self listen without your
[1:44:13] willingness and your
[1:44:16] self-disipline even Christ giving can uh
[1:44:20] uh you you know cannot make it your own.
[1:44:24] That's right. Remember even a pardon is
[1:44:27] not a pardon unless it's received as a
[1:44:29] pardon.
[1:44:30] That's right.
[1:44:32] So, so the Lord the Lord can save you,
[1:44:35] but but then you've got to come and
[1:44:37] abide in him. You've got to take his
[1:44:39] yoke upon you. You've got to start
[1:44:40] learning of him. You got to move
[1:44:41] forward. Don't lay there and and boohoo
[1:44:45] all day long. That's just what the
[1:44:46] devil, oh, I'm no good. It's worthless.
[1:44:48] There's no use. Well, that was always
[1:44:51] true. That's right. That was always
[1:44:53] true. He saved you when you were in the
[1:44:55] world, didn't he? My goodness. Now
[1:44:58] you've been born again. You love God.
[1:45:00] you believe his word, get up.
[1:45:03] Get up. Wipe the face off and say,
[1:45:05] "Lord, today uh your mercies are new
[1:45:09] every morning and I'm going to avail
[1:45:11] myself of your mercies and I'm going to
[1:45:14] take my sword and go forward."
[1:45:19] And you grab your sword and you're
[1:45:20] walking out your walking out the door
[1:45:22] and the devil calls behind you. What
[1:45:24] happens if it happens again? Well, then
[1:45:25] tomorrow his mercies will be new again.
[1:45:28] And I'll go I'll grab the sword again.
[1:45:31] And I'll do that the next day and the
[1:45:33] next day until I'm like Enoch. I get so
[1:45:36] close I'm closer there than I am here.
[1:45:40] [Applause]
[1:45:43] So this is why
[1:45:45] Jesus this is why he repeats his promise
[1:45:48] because he he can't make you live in an
[1:45:51] overcomer's life. He can't he can't he
[1:45:53] won't force you. He's not going to push
[1:45:55] you through a pipe to to force you to
[1:45:58] experience the fullness of joy.
[1:46:02] You're going to have to do that.
[1:46:06] See,
[1:46:08] so when we see him repeat his
[1:46:11] promise and of course this isn't this
[1:46:14] isn't the rest, you know, he he grants
[1:46:17] to those wondering stars, as brother
[1:46:19] Brandon called them, his children. Oh,
[1:46:22] wandering
[1:46:23] star, stop wondering. Come home tonight.
[1:46:27] You know, and and we come in and we know
[1:46:29] the Lord in a in a glorious rebirth. But
[1:46:33] but but we're talking tonight and I I
[1:46:35] just really have barely got to lay my
[1:46:37] foundation. I'm going to close, but or
[1:46:39] I'm going to push a pause button. And uh
[1:46:42] but but the the the thing that I want to
[1:46:44] leave with you before you go home
[1:46:46] tonight is that this is a deeper Yeah.
[1:46:50] This is something personal. This is an
[1:46:53] this is an appropriated rest because he
[1:46:57] says you shall find. Listen, he you come
[1:47:00] unto me and I'll give you rest. And and
[1:47:03] and and so when you when you go down,
[1:47:05] you realize that he now not only says
[1:47:08] come un come unto me, but take my yoke
[1:47:11] upon you and learn of me. So yield
[1:47:14] yourself to my training. Submit
[1:47:17] everything to my will and let your whole
[1:47:21] life be one with mine. Abide in me. And
[1:47:27] then he adds, not only I will give, but
[1:47:30] ye shall find. How many want to find it
[1:47:33] tonight? I'm glad he gives it, but I
[1:47:36] want to find it. I'm glad it's there to
[1:47:39] be found. And you can find it tonight in
[1:47:42] this service. I'm here to tell you, I've
[1:47:44] seen right while the preaching of the
[1:47:46] word goes forth. I've seen young people
[1:47:48] filled with the Holy Ghost. I've seen
[1:47:49] people rise up healed of diseases. I've
[1:47:52] seen oppression and depression broken.
[1:47:56] There's power in the word of God going
[1:47:58] forth. If you'll believe it, why don't
[1:48:00] you stand to your feet with me right now
[1:48:02] and just say, "Lord, I appropriate every
[1:48:05] blessing. I take it. It's mine. You paid
[1:48:08] the price. I'm going to take ownership
[1:48:10] of it tonight. I'm going to appropriate
[1:48:14] the word of God. I'm going to take every
[1:48:17] promise. It's mine.
[1:48:21] It's your inaliable right.
[1:48:24] Jefferson wrote of that there are some
[1:48:26] rights that are inaliable. He is the old
[1:48:29] old English archaic now. Unalable means
[1:48:32] same thing. Unalable. Inaliable. It
[1:48:35] means that that it's your right by being
[1:48:39] a human.
[1:48:41] Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.
[1:48:43] You have a right to that intrinsically.
[1:48:46] And so that means I don't need anyone's
[1:48:49] permission. That's what he was saying to
[1:48:50] the king. We don't need your permission
[1:48:52] to have liberty. I was born in the image
[1:48:54] of God. I have a right to liberty. I'm
[1:48:57] here to tell you something, friends. You
[1:48:58] need to say to the devil, I'm declaring
[1:49:01] independence from you tonight. I don't
[1:49:03] need your permission to have the joy of
[1:49:05] the Lord. I don't need your permission
[1:49:07] to believe God for every word. I don't
[1:49:09] need your permission. I don't need a
[1:49:11] treaty. I don't need an armistice. I'm
[1:49:14] going to fight you until the last breath
[1:49:16] in my body leaves me. And one day I'm
[1:49:19] going to dance on the hills of glory.
[1:49:22] One day we're going to shout together.
[1:49:24] The shout of the king will be among us.
[1:49:28] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:49:31] Let's raise up our hands. Blessed be the
[1:49:34] name of the Lord. Oh, we worship you
[1:49:36] tonight, oh God. We thank you for your
[1:49:39] mercies, oh Lord Jesus. Your mercies are
[1:49:43] great to us, Lord. Great is thy
[1:49:46] faithfulness, Lord. Oh, master, your
[1:49:49] word tonight, it thrills us, Lord. Is
[1:49:52] the last thing in the world the enemy
[1:49:54] wanted us to know, you've given us great
[1:49:57] secrets to your kingdom. And tonight,
[1:50:00] we're going to stop believing the enemy
[1:50:03] and we're going to start believing you.
[1:50:05] We're going to appropriate the blessing.
[1:50:06] We're going to take it into oursel.
[1:50:08] We're going to own it. I'm going to own
[1:50:10] it. I have a right to it. Oh, every head
[1:50:13] bowed, every head bowed. Listen friends,
[1:50:16] brother Brandham
[1:50:18] said taught us very clearly in many
[1:50:21] places, every son and daughter of God
[1:50:25] has a divine right to have a conference.
[1:50:30] No one can be denied you. That's another
[1:50:33] meaning of inaliable. It can't be
[1:50:35] altered. It can't be changed. It can't
[1:50:38] be taken from you. You don't need
[1:50:41] anyone's permission. You didn't get it.
[1:50:43] It was given to you.
[1:50:45] Why don't you exercise your right to a
[1:50:47] conference? Raise up those hands and
[1:50:49] say, "Lord God, tonight you see the need
[1:50:52] in my life, Lord. You see that that
[1:50:55] preacher don't know me. You knew me. And
[1:50:57] you you've sent your
[1:51:00] word when I have a purpose in my heart
[1:51:03] to say yay, Lord. Yay and amen to every
[1:51:06] word. Oh God, make us overcomers. Lord,
[1:51:09] give us the liberty that we are entitled
[1:51:12] to by the blood of that was shed for us
[1:51:14] at Calvary. Grant it, Lord. We are
[1:51:16] entitled to every redemptive blessing
[1:51:19] that you paid a horrible price for. I'm
[1:51:22] not going to see it sit on a shelf. I
[1:51:23] want to have active faith, Lord.
[1:51:26] I want to have active faith. May you
[1:51:30] grant it to us tonight. We love you. I
[1:51:32] thank you, Father, for these people.
[1:51:35] wonderful pull on the word patiently
[1:51:38] hearing a crazy man scream and wave his
[1:51:40] arms and oh, but it thrills us, Lord. It
[1:51:43] just thrills us. It just runs through us
[1:51:45] and we get so excited. It's become so
[1:51:48] wonderful. We thank you, Jesus. Oh, what
[1:51:51] a day that's going to be on the other
[1:51:53] side. Table thousands of miles long and
[1:51:57] we'll look across and there'll be
[1:51:58] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. Oh, we'll
[1:52:01] hear the stories and we'll weep and sob
[1:52:04] and hug. And a prophet said, "Then the
[1:52:06] king will walk out in all of his
[1:52:08] beauty." He'll say, "Don't weep no more.
[1:52:10] It's all over.
[1:52:12] It's all over. Enter into the joy
[1:52:16] of Oh, lamb of God, tonight we love you.
[1:52:20] We profess our allegiance to you. We
[1:52:23] rededicate ourselves, Lord, to divine
[1:52:25] fellowship.
[1:52:28] You had worship, but you wanted
[1:52:30] fellowship.
[1:52:32] Yeah. What David said, "What is a man
[1:52:34] that thou art mindful of him?" How is
[1:52:36] this even
[1:52:37] possible? The one who hung the moon and
[1:52:39] the stars is concerned about you and me.
[1:52:44] Lord, may you be our helper tonight.
[1:52:46] Lord, we love you for your promise word.
[1:52:49] We commit now everything else into your
[1:52:52] hands. Lord, may these meetings just be
[1:52:55] a a dynamic time in the word of God. I
[1:52:58] pray for the service tomorrow morning. I
[1:53:00] pray for your servant, Brother Chad.
[1:53:02] Lord, may you just anoint him with the
[1:53:04] mighty word of God. May it expose the
[1:53:07] enemy. Reveal Christ, Lord, and show us
[1:53:10] show us ourselves in the in the portrait
[1:53:13] of your word. Show us walking in the
[1:53:15] vision of Almighty God, cooperating in
[1:53:18] the vision. Grant it to us, Lord. We
[1:53:21] love you. We thank you in Jesus' name.
[1:53:24] Amen. Amen. Amen. What you going to
[1:53:26] sing, brother? Praise the Lord. My hope
[1:53:27] is in the Lord. I love it. That's a good
[1:53:29] one. Amen. Let's sing it all together.

[1:53:39] true, you'll be all right. Is in the
