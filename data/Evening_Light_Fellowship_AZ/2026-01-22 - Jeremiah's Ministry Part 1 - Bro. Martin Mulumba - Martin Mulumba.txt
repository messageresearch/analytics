And we can say that you are more than enough for us, Lord. You are Jehovah Jarra, Jehovah Nissi, Lord. All of our needs that we have on this earthly journey, we know that you have already provided, Lord. So, Father God, we come to you with confidence this evening, knowing that all things are in thy hands and you are in control of everything, Father. Therefore, that gives us a comfort in our hearts. It gives us a peace in our hearts, Father. That Lord, though the the waves may tempest and the rain may come, yet we know the master of the wind and the master of the rain. Father God, we ask this evening that you would come by by the foolishness of preaching. That you would speak to our hearts, Lord. Father, that whatever the need would be, that Lord, your your prophet told us that the word of the hour will meet the need of the hour. So let the word come forth. Let it meet our needs, Lord, and help us to set aside the cares of life, Father, that your word may have an effect that we might receive, believe, Lord, and and conceive, Lord, and bring forth life. We love you. We thank you. We commit all things, all these prayer requests, Lord, that have been penned. We commit each and every life into thy hands. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are expecting a great move of God in our lives. We are expecting, Lord, good reports, Father.

Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you saints. Uh without further delay, uh take our let's take our Bible in the book of uh John chapter 1. &gt;&gt; We'll read the first eight verses. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh, we don't. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was nothing made that was by that was made. In in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe. He was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light. May the Lord bless you. You may be seated. Uh tonight uh we will uh take uh time to uh break into Jeremiah's ministry as uh we did uh in introduction of it last night. I mean uh in the watch service God's grace and we believe we'll go bit by bit not rushing but not also not expending too much on the mother so that by God's grace we can be able to uh be able to understand and what God is uh the purpose behind everything that uh he likes to do. Jeremiah's ministry and uh we'll be speaking about God's condescension. I understand that the English dictionary doesn't define condescensation as the way Barnham uses it but we take the prophet's ways of uh applying it and uh just to give it a little bit more context and morph um we see that uh in the book of John uh is a man that the prophet qualifies as a man of love men who receive a lot of revelation uh and by uh God's grace in the beginning u Matthew, Mark, Luke and himself spoke about Jesus but um he's uh one of the person that goes before the foundation of the world and uh he started bringing all this uh idea about as uh he's laying that pattern says like from the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was made flesh and uh and dwelt among us um and uh people didn't understand what was uh what was happening why was the word coming and was this man the word what was it was a quite a quite a confus confusion and uh it seems to be the same way it is also in the days that we are living in but uh Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. Uh those things are called to to happen in order to for the word uh to be to be made manifest uh in this way that we are in the message. Uh we have uh so many things that uh we have learned over the years. Uh we've been preached uh different things and people have taken different paths and by God's grace. But then we understand that at times it's uh due to the way the word was given to people. People have read left and right up and down and they end up with all kind of conclusions. But God is rich in mercy has uh made uh used the people along along the along the years and uh the brothers from uh Shakina and um voice of God recordings to make as many messages available as possible so people can be able to realign uh with God's thought. And along the years uh uh you see that you know because of everything that have come about some have desired like you know you can only listen to the prophet and you can only the stuff this you can only uh go to church and all these things but then as uh you we take the word the prophet shows us that you know the truth is always in the middle. uh once you stay in the middle you always find the balance you always find the truth that uh all things are very wonderful because why because God was coming in and when God comes in more people want to get hold of one form only because they feel so safe around that form you get in the church people have preferences of ministers I like this form one is preaching this form and stuff but it's exactly what John is uh showing us here that God in the beginning was the word and this uh very word people couldn't understand uh how it was possible that God could be made flesh. Uh brother Bernham speaks here in live 57. Let's close our eyes to our imaginations a few moments and go way back into before there was anything. The great fountain of all eternity was this that spirit of love, that spirit of honesty, that spirit of trness in need in this perfection. And then out of the existence of the father which was the spirit uh went the logos. Uh in this time that uh god was uh all living by himself meaning the spirit before they be any elements that we know through science. Let it be atoms or molecules or or anything that we can call today sand or trees. uh this great fountain of love of purity understood that it was time for myself to get started to do certain things because brother Bernham says that he had everything in his mind. He took the time in his mind to just conceptualize everything. &gt;&gt; He took the time to point like you know I'll uh have some trees, I'll have a man, I'll have uh I'll do this over time and all these things here were just in his mind. But then all these things sure were not word yet because it was just seeds in him. Just like anybody will have ideas like you know I'll get married and I'll think that she will be my wife but until you tell her you propose to her to be that she will never be and uh therefore uh along these years or these years years isn't time but along God's eternal mind he had all these things he had figured out and he he understood that I'll be able to do this Then uh the first step that he took in order for him to fulfill all these desires. Um he said that let me create myself uh let me come out of me comes the first creation which is a body. And uh went the logos which was the son meaning that God could now have a place that he could work from. &gt;&gt; And this place that he could work from was the son. Not necessarily that uh the son was uh eternal because the son had the beginning the very time that he was created. But the eternal one, this eternal un uh um unseen spirit was able now to find a way to dwell in the logos which was the son which was brotherham say a theophony which is which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in the celestial body that's the logos the word spoke out of the the the the great fountains of life and went forth. And when he expressed himself, the first time he expressed himself, he was creating a body that could he could dwell himself into. And by him creating that body, it was now the first stage, the first display that the world or the the the the eternal God was uh made manifest in a certain body. And that body says um identify Christ of all ages. Remember God changes his form &gt;&gt; and morph the Greek word means he puts on a different mask. &gt;&gt; And uh in this very first mask it was the unseen God because Moses wanted to see God and he said that no man can see God and leave. But then the only way that he was able to be seen by Moses, he had to have a mask. And this mask now he's a um a different mask like uh like in Cameron or something or Shakespeare's play. He's like an actor. He changes his form. All those prophets were that was God in those prophets. So now God was able is coming down is now showing that hey I was able to do it for my own body now I'm also able to do it with the prophets. So anything that could have seemed impossible that this great fountain of God because human mind will try to conceptualize that spirit as a a fullfilling spirit where he ties everything in himself. But then for him to explain to us exactly what is happening he said I'll just create a body &gt;&gt; and that body is the logos and brotherham says here that that body says call it theophony the atonement that when we leave here we go in somewhere else whatever it may be it's it takes the apostle words I takes I take the the apostles word when he said If this earthly tabernacle or dwelling place be dissolved, we have one already waiting to move from this into that. &gt;&gt; Remember that we are moving from a body into another body. Meaning this body is an empty body. When God creates a body, it is an empty body until the very God comes into that body because the shadows that we are is the exactly what God was doing because God is the same yesterday, today and forever. And if he did it himself for his logos into which he went, then there's nothing impossible to take us from this earthly body into that heavenly body. &gt;&gt; But that's not the focus of us going into that body. But I'm showing God coming down taking a form by which people now he can start to create because from that logos theophony that's where we could read in Genesis 1 it said like let's make man after our own image and likeness because this man that is being created is also being created in like manner as God was. God has to create a spirit that is male and female in order now to take a part of himself to put into this body which is also Adam's and Eve theophony. So we see now that uh God is coming down as uh uh James 2:26 uh says for as a body without the spirit is dead. Right? &gt;&gt; So faith without works is dead also. &gt;&gt; So therefore God who believed in everything that he was without getting into that theophony the logos his works are dead because he has to create he has to display. without him displaying or bringing forth what he had in his mind, his faith is dead because there's no works abiding with it. So therefore God as he's coming down he's saying like you know and the logos uh thirsting for life which was the son of God went out created by these great fountains of purity and those spirits went out and it created the logos and it was a body it was in a form of what we are now. So therefore this theophony that we are speaking about it looks just like the way we are yes of course it is represented many times like you know as just a a set of light but but God's grace that's why I say like you know with the message but God's grace we see we have a totally different picture so that this is in the form of what we are now and it was a body it was in the form of what we are which is called in a clergy way of speaking speaking it a theophony. It's a body that doesn't have a spirit in it. &gt;&gt; So God is creating this body and goes into that body. The whole sufficient God everything that he was he was able to condense himself into that body &gt;&gt; to start to create. Then we see on the first day God created on the second day he created on the third he created on the fourth the fifth the sixth but then on the seventh day he was not satisfied that he created all these things because according to his program that he had in his mind he said I want to do all these things but then there was no man to till the soil and so therefore God took from the earth and uh he took a part of that theophony and put in the earthly man that we call uh Adam. &gt;&gt; And now so this Adam that was in a earthly man out of the dust of the earth plus a portion of the theophony that was created after the image of God male and female he put that into the man and the man in return now he found himself lonely. Baram says, "Look at Adam who was right there seeing how the cows were walking, how the horses were walking and everything. But he was alone. &gt;&gt; He had nothing to do with it. He was not sufficient. He couldn't find himself in the image of God fully." Brenham say he was not all together yet as he was supposed to be. So therefore, but then all these things as they're coming about, God is only unfolding his program bit by bit. &gt;&gt; Just as we would say like, you know, we send one segment at a time. We're revealing one episode at a time. And as Isa unfolded these things, then God knew that I need to put Adam in a condition by which he had to fall. And by if Adam can fall, he'll be a great situation so that I can be able to unfold the next segments of what I have. And in another frame of the picture, Adam find himself that he goes to sleep and a woman is brought out of him and uh the other part, the feminist part of Adam was put into brought to Adam and he said, "Behold this time flesh of my flesh of my bones. God looked at it, it was not enough. &gt;&gt; He had to unfold another frame of the picture. He said, "Well, Adam is doing good and it's this here, but my everything I have in my mind is not enough." Then God puts activates a seed in uh one of the angels to bring him to try to find himself to look like God. After a while, he went along the streets of heaven and he find twothird of the angels and he made his campaign and like just any good politicians. Oh, I'll give you a new road system in the land. I'll give give you jobs and and all the angels saw that he was so wonderful. Oh, you'll have you'll make a a a land that is a kingdom that is better than Michael's. Oh, I'm for that. We are living in a very primitive stage and the only thing that we do every day is just praising him, praising him. We need something else. &gt;&gt; So it is also in the church today as we desire every time that a minister comes on the pulpit, we need something new. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that very same mind that it started now bringing people that it to the position that when there's nothing new on the pulpit then they finding themselves now they are stuck backsliding before you find yourself then people are leaving the church why because they were not able to wait for God's program and as it was unfolding &gt;&gt; because God knew that time will come that I'll have to come down and fellowship with you and teach you things that are much greater. But Eve said, he said, "No, no, no, no. This is enough. I know all the discernments in the tapes and I've seen you Adam called giving names and uh uh revealing the nature of all the animals, but this is not enough. I need a whole new Adam being." We understand that Eve is not uh a seed of the devil but it was in the nature of men to desire always something new. Just as we see in time that human beings are not always happy with what they have. They always need some new with some new stuff. &gt;&gt; We need to conquer a little bit. Oh, if you love me, you need to take me to the restaurant. After the restaurant, like you know, you need to take me to Paris. After Paris, I've traveled all over the world. It's not enough. After we've went all over the world, okay, now you need to take me to the moon. Why? Human being is always searching for something better and greater. &gt;&gt; So therefore, now God knowing how he created the man, he knew with a with a clear understanding that I'll be able to provide because I am Jehovah Gyra. I will be able to provide to everything. But it's according to my timeline. It's according to the way I've laid out things. &gt;&gt; And here we are. We see now that in the beginning, we would see Jesus. In the beginning, God was a spirit. And all the fountain of goodness and mercy and power and all the good things of love, God was the center of that fountain. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord, he's standing there. He's looking. He's surrounding. He He has everything with him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Adam, I'll give it to you. &gt;&gt; I am the center of all this here, &gt;&gt; but I'll bring it according to my own timing and according to my own state. &gt;&gt; But then remember now the only time that every every uh evening God was coming down in the form of the light." But say the man came out of the light. He would uh fellowship with Adam and Eve. How was your day? How did everything go and stuff and all these things here until God comes down and say, "Adam, Adam, where are thou?" &gt;&gt; The man went to try to hide behind all the new knowledge that he had discovered. He found himself that he has so much knowledge. He say like, "No, no, no, no. I don't need to come into your presence anymore because I have now this fig leaf that I can hide myself behind. &gt;&gt; We don't need God anymore. We don't need to go to church. We don't need the prophet. We don't need the ministers. Now all the discoveries that we have, we can just sit with it. &gt;&gt; Adam was sitting there and not understanding that what kind of condition he was putting himself into. But a God who's rich in mercy &gt;&gt; will first so that Adam in this condition that's fine it's okay I'll deal with you and I'll be able to bring you back. So now this is where God's condensation is coming into play into view that he was the uh the fountain of all that and then the logos that went out from God in the beginning become what we we call a theophony a supernatural body. God is just not like the air, &gt;&gt; but he's in a body. &gt;&gt; Moses seen him pass and said, "Look like the back part of a man." And so forth. And then that same Theophony was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld him, the only begotten of the father, Christ. But then we see now from Genesis until Christ had come about, we see that God was appearing and uh revealing himself in many different forms. &gt;&gt; And then we wonder why would God be just be interested time to time to be appearing and to be displaying himself. Yeah, &gt;&gt; says uh live the great fountain of all eternity that was in spirit that was uh in spirit the word uh spoken the great fountain uh um seems like I repeated that quote there we can speak skip that we see that uh in the time of um uh in Genesis 14 let's go first there Genesis 14 and and when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive on his strange servant born in his own house 380 and pursue and divided himself um against them and and he and his servant by night and smokeote them and pursued them unto which was on the left end of Damascus and verse 18 and Mechisedc king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and and he was the priest of the most high and he blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abra Abraham of the most high possessor of heaven and earth and and blessed be the most high which have delivered th um thine enemies into thy hand and gave him gave him tithes of all things." Here we are. We have now God again appearing to Abraham. Abraham coming down from uh returning from the slaughter of the kings he find himself like you know who am I dealing with it's like you know who is this man that comes to me after that I have overcome after I have went and to rescue Lot &gt;&gt; and Lot now he's finding himself in this meeting between Abraham and Melchisedc Melchisedc is standing there he's offering the communion and in this great meeting something happens to Lot Yeah, &gt;&gt; despite that they had already separated but something happened to Lot and Lot is standing there in this fellowship remember in God's pardon of things that uh when a man's come a man comes to God he gets baptized and he get rescued by the word and all these things here and this man starts a journey depending on the level that they setting themselves to go with the word will determine the eternal destination. So therefore Lord in this case that we find that Lot can only went only so far into receiving communion bread and wine. &gt;&gt; Nothing else was so concerning to Lot. We'll get to that. I know I made a statement last time and it seems like it was a little bit disrupting but God's grace will take time to lay it out according to the prophet. Now this Misedc and uh um uh 1955 and one day he was sitting there and the second time now we see now this Misedc is coming down he said again one day he was sitting down in the door of the tent under the big hook it was still stands in the memorial in a memorial today and uh it char all over and held and there Abraham sitting in the doors in his tent seisedc coming to him there coming to him three men walking and I just imagine saying imagine Abraham saying I've seen him before and he comes up and he said come by my lord and let fetch a little water for your feet some somehow weigh down that covenant man down in his heart knew that that was somebody more than a man &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This misedc that uh started from the great fountain of life. &gt;&gt; The second time we see him on earth is a fellowshipping with Adam. When Adam falls and he comes, he steps out of the light and takes the lamp and and makes a dressing out of them. &gt;&gt; Oh, how God is so concerned about how people should dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How himself comes down to do it. He could have chosen uh Abel to do it, &gt;&gt; but he said, "No, no, no, no. I have to come down and do it myself." &gt;&gt; He dressed them and let them go out of the stuff. But God was not satisfied. &gt;&gt; Why was he not satisfied? Because he wanted to fellowship with his own. And he said like, you know, he said, "We are strangers." Said, "We've come from a foreign country. The clothes were dusty." Oh, how beautiful God is. He created the very clothes that that man Mechisedc was able to wear. &gt;&gt; He was not purchased from an outlet out there but himself conceptualize it because in his great mind he had everything. &gt;&gt; Because he was the center of everything. &gt;&gt; Anything that uh Lucifer was able to produce out there is just a shadow. It's just a provision of what God had already. No, no clothing, no way of dressing according to culture, according to this year, if it doesn't align according to God's program, it is nothing but the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Despite of everything that we can call it to be, &gt;&gt; he said we are strangers. So the clothes were dusty. Yes, THERE WAS ALL THE WAY FROM GLORY. And so they walked up there and said, Abraham, they brought them a little stuff and washed. and Abraham begin to look at them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham is looking what what's the purpose of your visit? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All the way from eternity to stand up here. What's the purpose of it? &gt;&gt; What's the purpose of the message coming down to us? What's the purpose of it? &gt;&gt; Then people started beholding it &gt;&gt; along the years. God. Glory be to God. As I stated uh uh giving credit to voice of god and shakina and all these brothers doing all this work in order to bring forth the word unto us &gt;&gt; in forms of tapes and books and stuff we standing we're looking what are we dealing with &gt;&gt; what do we have this year then Abraham had now mechisedc now has to reveal the purpose of his visit every single time that The Lord comes down, he comes down for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And every new believer that catches the purpose of God's visitation, &gt;&gt; that's his salvation. &gt;&gt; That's why I said that here we've seen now lot coming down to this great meeting. But his mind was only limited to the bread and wine to some physical elements that he was attracted to. Oh, now I have a freedom from all these things here. I don't smoke anymore. I don't do I don't do. No, no, no. That's not enough, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray theec 2022. I pray God that every sick person in here that their faith will be sufficient this morning. Now to remember that the great that great Melchisedc back yonder who had no beginning of days. &gt;&gt; He never had a father nor a mother. He never had an end of life that still lives today. &gt;&gt; What are people are dealing with? They are dealing with the very same misedc. &gt;&gt; For what purpose? To dress them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For what purpose? to fellowship with them. &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT PURPOSE? TO DWELL in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; OH MY. THIS GREAT MELKISEDC. See what the prophet says here. Then was incarnated called Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; became flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Died. WENT BACK TO again to the spirit. He He's He is still the king of peace, the king of righteousness, promising us that this great eternal things. &gt;&gt; It's been sold by God, &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; to Abraham that he would keep the covenant, &gt;&gt; the promise brought him and his seed &gt;&gt; forever. Help us today to walk forward to this platform now with undying faith. THAT THE PEOPLE COULD STAND AND look and say &gt;&gt; God and more FAITH &gt;&gt; WHEN I'M PICKING UP THAT BOOK GOD and more FAITH &gt;&gt; WHEN I'M LISTENING TO THAT WORD GOD and more &gt;&gt; faith &gt;&gt; that's WHY WHEN ONE GOES ONLY WITH THE tapes &gt;&gt; it's limiting God &gt;&gt; when you go only with the ministers &gt;&gt; you're limiting God &gt;&gt; and where is the truth right IN THE MIDDLE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OVER TIME GOD KEEPS CHANGING his forms &gt;&gt; and he likes to do IT BECAUSE HE'S THERE THAT great fountain he wants to display that love through a certain form &gt;&gt; then WHEN WE CHOOSE ONLY ONE PART OF THAT form then we're messing the whole program &gt;&gt; and that's what denomination did it did what it limit God's work because they didn't want God to come in a certain form &gt;&gt; but because of this God who's able to create any form that he wants was able to dwell in anybody that he wants. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we cannot limit God. &gt;&gt; But say like no no no it's not God. No, no, no. God cannot do this. No, no, no. It was not God. Then we have to take all these scriptures out of the word in order to fit that idea that we want. Because the Pharisees and Sadducees with all their knowledge thought it was important for them to conceptualize God the way they wanted to conceptualize IT. OF COURSE, THEY'VE read Moses and they've seen the Moses speaking of the pillar of fire. Of course, they knew it that way. But they didn't consider &gt;&gt; Melisedc &gt;&gt; because when God was made flesh, he was before being coming flesh, he was first a light. And that light was with Moses in the burning bush. But the same God, it turned around, he looked and he turned to Abraham. It was a man, &gt;&gt; a man that would be able to eat, a man that was able to drink, a man that was able to have dust on his clothes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why was he able to do that? Because he is God. &gt;&gt; The great fountain of spirit of surrounding himself with everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrew chapter 6. We'll find him right here meeting Abraham before that in the order of Mechisedc, a body of flesh, which was God. Sure. It was. He was God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We cannot limit God per se because we can clearly see that you say then brother Brham why would he have to come back and be born he wasn't born yet &gt;&gt; MISEDC WAS NOT BORN yet because this was a created body in full man grown man just like Adam &gt;&gt; HE PARDONED HIMSELF WITH ADAM AND SAID like you know hey I need to go visit um Abraham and I'll just take a body and move along with it. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; BUT IN GOD'S PROGRAM, GOD WAS not satisfied &gt;&gt; because the man has fallen. And since he has fallen now, I need to come a little closer to understand what man is going through. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like you know having not having a child and having a child. Loving somebody's child and loving your own child. It's a different story because you know all the process that you have to go through in order to have that body that you call son. And as the sun is growing, you understand what it is to be able to take all that is in you and pouring it into your child. &gt;&gt; Because as you are pouring that into your child, you want to see the reflection of yourself in the child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if the child doesn't walk according to what you are, you calling it a deception. with everything that I've done in this life to end up with a drug dealer. &gt;&gt; Because nothing in you was a drug dealer. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOTHING HAS CROSSED YOUR MIND to be a a robber, a womanizer. &gt;&gt; You say I am a man of character. &gt;&gt; I am respected on time. I have created all these things here. How come my child is ending up into the uh regions of the lost and has a murderer, has a liar and all these things? &gt;&gt; God had to come down &gt;&gt; into his son. You see, he wasn't he wasn't born then. He was just created a body that dwelt in Mechisedc was uh was the king of Salem which is the king of Jerusalem which is the king of peace. Remember the great fountain of love which is the great fountain of peace and love and everything. He is also the king of it which had neither father to mother beginning of days or ending of life. Jesus had both father and mother had a beginning of days and ending of life but he was made after the order of mechc which had no beginning of days or ending of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. this Jesus who is a coming forth born out of Mary the body. Then brotherham says you see Jesus I hope I have it here. Um when Jesus was born a siran church age. Oh how striking it is. Jehovah born crying over a man pile. &gt;&gt; Jehovah born in a manger of straw. Jehovah there is your everlasting sign. The the to the proud and the puffed up the poed intellects and that have that have evolved their own theology and denied the truth of God. Jehovah God a crying baby in a sticking bond. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This great fountain of love &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; comes down the same way that he created a son at the beginning to make the creation. He comes again. He creates another body in whom to fulfill a different part of his great segment. &gt;&gt; Then that's this great Jehovah being born in a barn. When the magi comes two years down the road, they look at the man, they say like, you know, who is this? That's Jehovah. &gt;&gt; How's that possible? &gt;&gt; How is that possible that you know this is to be Jehovah? &gt;&gt; HOW CAN GOD COME AND AND SAY LIKE, YOU KNOW, this is the king of the the Jews? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHILE THEY made all their ideas, GOD can only be so much. God can only do so far. &gt;&gt; GOD CAN ONLY BE CONTAINED IN THIS FORM. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT THERE IS YOUR EVERLASTING SIGN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S STANDING THERE IN the midst of you all. He created a cell. He created everything and then came unto Mary and put the word in Mary. And as Mary is looking, everything that is growing within her has is not a procedure of her own ability. is not a remarkable understanding of his own of her own &gt;&gt; but only thing that he she had to do was to believe &gt;&gt; I'm showing us that God is coming down in all these forms &gt;&gt; HE'S SHOWING US TYPES OF types that I am able to dwell among you &gt;&gt; in the simplicity of faith &gt;&gt; to fulfill what I have to fulfill &gt;&gt; but then as I am fulfilling All these things it's only limited to my program. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus will be born. Mechisedc will come about but only to fulfill a segment of my program. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not two persons. I don't need anybody helps. I'll do it myself &gt;&gt; because I've conceptualized it &gt;&gt; and I'll come down and fulfill it. How striking God did he deny the truth? Then we then we think we have a right to be proud, holding up our noses, criticizing and acting as though we were somebody. &gt;&gt; He's your real sign. &gt;&gt; This is the right one. Jehovah playing as a boy. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IMAGINE THOSE people looking at the child, a six-year-old boy playing there. &gt;&gt; They tell them that's the creator of heaven and earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you mean playing like that? It's impossible. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THEY CONCEPTUALIZED IT. &gt;&gt; BUT NEVERTHELESS, ALL THESE THINGS, GOD WAS SHOWING IT TYPE AFTER TYPE AND SHADOW AFTER SHADOW. &gt;&gt; HE TOLD SAMUEL, "I AM THE REJECTED KING. HOW COME I AM THE ONE PREACHING THE WORD?" NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, SAMUEL. It's not you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Misedc that is being rejected. &gt;&gt; This is the real one. Jehovah playing as a boy. JEHOVAH WORKING IN A CARPENTER'S CHAR SHOP. &gt;&gt; Jehovah washing the feet of fishermen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Along all these years what people are beholding. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother says that it's so simple. &gt;&gt; Yeah. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT PEOPLE can't just understand it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's the very challenge that we have today. &gt;&gt; In the simplicity of words, &gt;&gt; people are looking and say like, you know, no, no, no, no, maybe not that way. Maybe we don't need it that that that much. Hebrew chapter 7, uh, verse uh, Proverbs 21. Now he was the king of righteousness, the king of Jerusalem, the king of uh of of righteousness, the king of peace. Jesus was called the prince of peace and the prince is the son of a king. So this man Mechisedc was king of peace. Then he would have to be the father of the prince of peace. Now they are looking this great mystery of God himself unfolding &gt;&gt; that Mechisedc BEING THE FATHER HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE that's the great the great mystery of Jesus Christ whereby like you know some say like you know Joseph was his father &gt;&gt; according to the worldly understanding &gt;&gt; some SAY WELL GOD WAS HIS FATHER. Then another says the Holy Spirit is his father. That who is his father? &gt;&gt; HE'S THE VERY SAME PERSON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY? Only the only thing is he's only changing forms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE JUST HAVE HARD time following the spirit as he's changing the forms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they want to limit in which form God is able to work in. Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, if I'm a Jew, oh, I only want to see him as a light. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because that's what Moses told us. &gt;&gt; That your Lord is light. That's what crossed them in the in the uh in the in the Red Sea. It was light. &gt;&gt; Then now when he changes and becomes a man, it is a troublesome time. &gt;&gt; They can't comprehend it. &gt;&gt; And brother Renham says uh Mighty Conqueror 95. When he was in heaven, he was the logos that went out of God in the beginning. And he came down on earth and was he was not to be made an angel. He came down on earth and took the form of bondsman. Not an angel. Not somebody of a great stature. He came down on earth and took the form of bonesmen. Not an angel. not not come down in the great in down in the great Jehovah glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not seen of a great statue. &gt;&gt; But he was Jehovah. But in the forms that is coming in is so simple. &gt;&gt; They were expecting that you know the glory of God where God was creating thunders and trees coming out and stuff but he was still able to come down so lowly. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walking in. &gt;&gt; Oh, who are you? I am John. Who are you? I am Peter. Who are you? Oh, okay. Yeah. He's playing there doing everything just like everybody was doing and stuff. In Luke 2:46, and it came to pass that after 3 days, they found him in the temple. Uh uh Joseph and Mary and Mary had lost Jesus. And Jesus is growing just like uh Jehovah is growing, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking asking them questions. And uh all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. And when they saw him, they were amazed. And his mother said unto him, "Son, you born out of me. You are my son. You have to listen to what I tell you. Where I go as a parent, you need to listen to me. &gt;&gt; Why has thou dust dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I, your mother sought thee sorrowing. We were crying. We had you all over the news. That's the understanding of who he was, &gt;&gt; right? And he said unto her to them, how is it that ye sought me? &gt;&gt; How is it that ye sought me? Was ye not ye not that I must be about my father's business? Amen. &gt;&gt; The great spirit is coming down, &gt;&gt; not for me to become your family member, &gt;&gt; your church member, &gt;&gt; to be found as your husband, &gt;&gt; as your brother, but I'm I'm here for a specific purpose &gt;&gt; with Abraham. I came down to give him bread and wine. &gt;&gt; When Abraham saw me again, I gave him the circumcision. &gt;&gt; When he saw me again, I gave I came to give him the promise of a son. &gt;&gt; When I came down again, I CAME TO TELL HIM about the destru upcoming destruction of Sodom. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT MARY and Joseph now turn all that program into you are my son. &gt;&gt; You born into my family. &gt;&gt; You need to listen to me, your father and I. How that you are looking for me. &gt;&gt; We turn the word today into a geographic locations appropriation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. OH, THE WORD CAME FIRST FOR THESE PEOPLE. So therefore, you people here cannot understand it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU MISSING GOD'S great program coming down fulfilling and unfolding? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if we miss that also today, we are also just desperate just as Lot was. Because Lot also believed. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Because Mary also believed. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; The visitation of the angel. &gt;&gt; You shall have a son. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. But then WHEN THE CHILD IS BORN, now we're turning it into our only fleshly understanding. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And they understood not the saying which he spoke unto them. And he went down with them and came to Nazare Nazareth and subject unto and was subject unto them, you know, organizations mindset. But his mother kept all these saying in in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men. &gt;&gt; This Jehovah &gt;&gt; who was a comforter who was a child playing born in a sticking born here come now he's growing up. And in John 1 29 when now Jesus grows this great Jehovah fulfilling the purpose where unto he was called the father's business. The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said, "Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we know him. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THIS IS JOSEPH'S SON. OH, it's a family mother. Oh, JON IS HIS SECOND COUSIN. OH, it's now they're making it. Oh, look at these people. The same spirit yesterday, &gt;&gt; the same spirits today &gt;&gt; because they were able to behold the word. &gt;&gt; They could touch it. They could play with it. But then when the word becomes now to be made manifest or in other words, the word comes into action &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO, &gt;&gt; they're still looking at it as a Mary's son. But it was God. It was Jehovah. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE GREAT FOUNTAIN OF EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; Comes down brother. Uh the Bible says here this is he of whom I said after he after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me. &gt;&gt; This is of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me. before he was before me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John is taking the time to teach them the word. &gt;&gt; Look, the one that you are dealing with, it's not just what you know playing in the yard &gt;&gt; as a carpenter who has a who when he's hungry you feed him food and everything, &gt;&gt; but you are dealing with a different type. of ministry at this time. &gt;&gt; And John bear record um before me. 31. And I knew him not, but that he should be made manifest to Israel. Therefore, I am come baptizing with water. And John Ben bear record saying, I saw the spirit descending from heaven. Remember, descending from heaven is not a up and down movement. It is a taking form, taking shape, going into action &gt;&gt; because those who have went up with the uh rockets and everything didn't get to it. And when they went out there, they told them that you left it behind here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And this great Jehovah coming in to the sun, in other words, is now I'm starting the ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because in the Old Testament, NO MAN COULD COME into the priesthood until he's 30 years old. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, NOW GOD NOW IS ACTIVATING THE VERY SAME PART OF himself &gt;&gt; into THIS SON WHO WAS CALLED FOR A SPECIFIC purpose which was to die for the sins of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; With Mechisedc, we see everything that he did with Abraham. With Jesus, we see everything that he's doing with him. &gt;&gt; But he doesn't limit himself there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And John bear record saying that I saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and I knew him not. But he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with uh uh baptize with the Holy Spirit, with the Holy Ghost, and so and bear record that this is the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This is the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where God &gt;&gt; is coming to do the work. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PLACE THAT God is doing this specific work. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND EVERY SINGLE TIME, THAT'S WHY IT IS IMPORTANT before we get into Jeremiah's ministry that we see this condensation of God. this God are coming down and morphing &gt;&gt; so THAT WE KNOW WHAT TYPE OF WORK IS ALLOTTED TO him again today. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Because Baram says like you know after his death and resurrection he says like you know I'll tell you what the world knows little about about his work after his resurrection. He said like you know people talk about him he died and he resurrected and all these things here but what he did afterward people know nothing about in his theophony when he he resurrected he had a specific work to do in his theophony when he went into the regions of the loss he had a specific work to do &gt;&gt; who is that the great mechisedc who was that the great fountain OF LOVE WHO IS that the great Jehovah &gt;&gt; and this great Jehovah is coming down one step at a time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And as he's displaying himself is not for you to turn him into your church member, &gt;&gt; into your religion, &gt;&gt; into sets of of orders and all these things here. No, no, no, no. He is concerned about his child who was fallen by representation &gt;&gt; and he has to bring him back again &gt;&gt; and has is coming down. In other word has is changing forms. In other words, as is taking edge after age. Let's just read this so we can close. Hebrews chapter 7 and in there we find out that he had seven variety of spirits. Is that right? The Bible says in revelation that seven spirits before the throne of God. Is that right? The seven manifold seven spirit. We find out that there is a seven colors. There is seven church ages there and all just uh oh it just runs. Seven is complete and God was complete. &gt;&gt; And seven spirit and those spirits were perfect. &gt;&gt; The first was the color of red. perfect love, redemption, or how if we had time to give those colors a show of each one of those colors representing represents God's purity. Amen. Those colors, there were seven colors. Those colors represent the period of God. And those colors represent represents the motives of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. in his way of displaying himself the great fountain of love. He said like you know in each of all these cows these are my motives &gt;&gt; because I came down and I died and I resurrected and all these things here. Now see now the other part of me coming into view. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THOSE PART OF YOU that we need to see? It comes down. It gives you types and shadows and and symbols. It gives you seven colors. Oh, each color will display something out of it. &gt;&gt; Oh, each color is representing God's motive. &gt;&gt; Oh, this color is showing every stage that he's taking the believer back to unity with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO THEREFORE, EVERY SINGLE believer that comes around, remember, that's why I spoke about Lot. You come along under the first color, you accept, under the red light of redemption. &gt;&gt; You agree with it, but it's not enough. That's why I was able to say that Lot was saved. &gt;&gt; Sure. because it came down under the blood at that time but it didn't go all the way to the end. &gt;&gt; We'll take more time to break that into more details. THIS GREAT FOUNTAIN OF LOVE is displaying his motives. &gt;&gt; And this motives we see he says brother gives us the hint. He say you see the light you see out of that diamond you the reflection of the light he gives you seven colors and those seven colors out of the red is redemption. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then you have every other color that comes after it which is displaying specifically what he wants to do in that certain age. Now we see that out of those ages. Now we see those cycles repeating in itself &gt;&gt; because the cycles that uh uh as uh uh Jesus was giving the parable of of the swer those who work in the first in the first um the first hour they came they planted and they got the reward. the second hour, the third, and all the way to the last one. They looked and they said, "How come we have labored &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; all these years, but they at the end are receiving the same reward &gt;&gt; as us at the end." &gt;&gt; He said, "But we agree with you the way I should pay you forward." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT. HOW COME PEOPLE AT THE END of all this time are able to receive the recompense of every other age? &gt;&gt; Because I am Jehovah. &gt;&gt; I cannot at the end of everything keep still hiding myself. &gt;&gt; I have to unveil myself fully unto people. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And that is that's why I had to take the time first to lay down these things so that Jeremiah's ministry is not seen and be heard looked at as the way the Pharisees the Pharisees uh the the Pharisees and Mary and Joseph looked at him right &gt;&gt; oh yes I paid you what you're supposed to have but in this cycle of the last hour everything comes back in repetition in between. And in that last cycle we see NOW THAT ALL THESE OTHER FIRST CYCLES, first ages, second ages AND STUFF, ALL THEIR BENEFIT, we are finding it under the last age. &gt;&gt; And as we are finding it in the last age, the same way that the great Jehovah we read it says he is here fully. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother say that they are looking for him but he say he has already returned. &gt;&gt; I'll bring the court. I'm getting ahead of myself. But we see that this great light is coming down. In other words is I come in this age. I do a specific work. And if we look at God's pattern of the Bible, we know that every single age that we are living in, those cycles repeat itself. &gt;&gt; Some of us, we giving birth to children, that cycles begins again. &gt;&gt; If you believe and get baptized, born again, receive the Holy Spirit, adoptions, everything in between. Of course, he has already done it. Of course in his mind everything is finished. &gt;&gt; All that he has called he has already glorified. It's a finished work. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless in time it still has to do it. &gt;&gt; God condescending. &gt;&gt; How is he condescending in the way that he wants to do it? And when we find the forms that he wants to do with it, we don't want to sit down and say well we don't need that form. He can be in that form. He can be in this form &gt;&gt; because that's his program. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Musicians, if you can come forward. Thank you, brother Ron. Thank you, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could get the words for uh good to me. Good to me. Because you are good to me. Good to me. You are good to me. Good to me. You are good to me. Verse one, I put all my hope on the truth of your promise. and I steady my heart on the ground of your goodness. And when I bow down with sorrow, I will lift up your name. And the foxes in the vineyard will not steal my joy because you are good to me. Good to me. You are good to me. Good to me. You are so good to me. Verse two. And I lift up my eyes to the hills where my help is found. &gt;&gt; Your voice fills the night. Raise my head up to hear the sound. And though fires burn all around me, I will praise you, my God, and the foxes in the vineyard will not steal my joy. Because you are good to me. Good to me. You are so good to me. Good to me. You are good to me. Good to me. Oh, because you are good to me. Good to me. You are good to me. Good to me. You are good to me. Verse two. Verse two.
