know why but I've struggled with high blood pressure and so I come up for prayer at one point and just kind of left it in the Lord's hands and about a month ago I got pretty sick on a Saturday night that was the Sunday morning that we had brother Austin fill in for the for the song service and didn't eat anything for a couple days and later that week took my blood pressure again and everything was back down to normal and Tina said well maybe it's just cuz you haven't eaten anything well that might be so been monitoring my blood pressure for 5 weeks and it's been back down to normal so Lord Works in ways we don't understand but if it took getting sick that I appreciate that so just want to thank the Lord for his goodness I was thinking of the song yesterday he brought me out of the myy

you've been mentioned already if you haven't you're not you might be overlooked by by man but not by God he knows you're Harry God bless you brother Neil it's good to have you and your family Warren and Carmen God bless you old friends of ours from up in Canada always good to have them here with us amen turn with me if you would please into the book of St Matthew chapter 6 Matthew chapter 6 verses 9- 15 hallelujah amen Matthew chapter 6 9-15 after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation and Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but somebody say but but you better watch those in in the scripture but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses Lord that is pretty powerful God guard our hearts amen yes watch over our lips yes keep us right before you yes and help us to learn to forgive turn with me to the Book of Luke chapter 7 verses 47- 50 Luke 7 verse 47 wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him began to say with in themselves who is this That Forgives sins also and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace amen may God add the blessing to his word you may be seated this morning in his presence Hallelujah I'd like to take for a thought this morning the forgiving heart the forgiving heart I like take a subject of learning to forgive others now I've spoken the last couple sermons concerning the heart we know the Bible speaks in multitudes of places about the heart it says that a heart is very deceitful and it's very Wicked who can know it amen and so I've spoke about the condemning heart I've spoke about healing the Brokenhearted I've spoke about the unconverted heart but I think one thing that many of us even as Believers have always got to put ourselves in remembrance of and that is a forgiving heart amen yes learning to forgive because it's not the nature you were born with to forgive and so I'd like to expound for a short time this morning concerning the forgiving heart I looked up the word forgive it means to excuse for a fault or an offense to Pardon to renounce anger or resentment against someone to put it away to renounce it it also means to absolve from payment of a debt I had a debt I couldn't pay and no matter how much I would live according to the law it's our righteousness and our justification does not come by how well we can keep the law in fact the Bible says by the keeping of the law is no man Justified before God so it's not how good we live but it's how good he has lived Hallelujah and we want to guard our hearts because our hearts can become hardened calloused and though we be religious and we go to church and we claim to be the bright to Christ God help us that we have a forgiving heart us Lord sometimes you can talk so spiritual yeah and act like you have your life together yeah but if your heart is not in the right condition then you're deceiving yourself the Bible says your religion is in vain Matthew 15: 7 through n the Bible says ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah a prophet prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth notice they draw nigh unto him they worship god with their mouth and honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of of men so we know that the keeping of the law does not justify us before God but it is the act of faith that God gives you as a free gift for we are saved by th faith knowing that it is a gift from God it is not by anything you did but God gave it to you by his grace thank you Lord none of us can boast about how what faith we have because it's not ours it's freely given to us of God and I say this that when you ask God for more faith he gives you more faith you have to receive it you have to believe it you have to accept it your works is your faith expressed tell me you have faith show me your Works amen tell me you believe this message let me see your life that you live amen and you putting your faith into action did you know that forgiveness is one of the greatest attributes of God that you as a bride member can to put on display forgiveness to forgive others and yet many times we as message Believers can still see how that some of the Believers who are around us open their mouths very wide and they condemn and they criticize and they become so critical of others and yet within themselves feel so self-righteous because I'm glad I'm not like one of them how can we ask God to forgive us our trespasses if we do not forgive those who have trespassed against us I've personally seen and witness now and how that Brethren are not forgiving their families and loved ones because something had been done to them that offended them now the Bible says that offenses must needs come offenses will come if I ask anybody in here how many of you have never been offended it would be probably the little child that didn't know the question but the rest of you say yep yep why my brother or my sister or this one or that one or this pastor or this pre preacher or this quote message believer offended me which one of you have not been offended it depends on your attitude towards offenses that will display the very character of what you say you have within you we ask God create in me a clean heart right renew the right spirit in me there is nothing so defiling to a Christian than to have your spirit defiled because you are holding resentment or Vengeance or anger or hatred or frustrations towards someone else whether they did it on purpose or not you have no right to hold something against someone because Christ says You must F learn to forgive help us Lord Brother Brenham says in God hiding in Simplicity but God see he's he made and my printer printed that something happened here that he would meet man but it was under the shed blood and that's the only way no matter no matter how much we uh try another way that's the only place will God will meet man for Fellowship is under shed blood he talks about Israel under shed blood the only place they could worship was under blood in paragraph 69 there's only one place that man can meet and fellowship with God and fellowship with each other that's under the cross when each man accepts the blood of Jesus Christ I don't care in all of his pecul peculiarity I can't pecularity in all of his uniqueness let me say this to I I like this word because are we not all kind of peculiar in our ways let's face it you are a peculiar people and some of you are very very peculiar some of you are very unique but God still loves you thank you Lord amen I love God's diversity and I thank God that he can love us no matter how pecar we are and brother Brenham said look in all of the peculiarity he says he can still reach over and put his hand in the next man's hand and call him brother amen when we meet at the cross where Jesus died amen amen under the blood because of Calvary I can call any man brother that's right you know there's been others that have offended me sure they've done me wrong sure but God by his grace allows me to still give him the right hand of Fellowship why because God is forgiven me and he that's forgiven much loveth much and real Godly a goppo love covers a multitude of sins but we've got to learn to forgive it's not our nature to forgive right love and forgiveness are two of the most Godly attributes that we can dis lay in our lives love and forgiveness are always connected together within the scriptures and as I've been studying the last several days just on forgiveness and I think each one of us are overwhelmed about God's forgiveness to you yeah that he could love such a sinner such as I thank you Jesus we wel welcome God's forgiveness to us do we not we say thank you Lord for the cross thank you for the blood yes thank you for your forgiveness then how can we look down on others how can we hold a grudge how can we have something in our heart well I'll tell you what come on no matter what I'll never forgive them I will never say uh I'm sorry I will never receive whatever excuse we have how can you Harbor that in your heart brother Brenham said it will defile your spirit and keep you out of the Kingdom God help us amen the type of person that is always speaking their mind without being sensitive to others feelings yeah will always always have a few friends why they be who wants to be around somebody who's always truthfully honest you have to be careful about those truthfully honest people you know sometimes you don't have to see everything honey does this dress look nice on me yeah what I'm saying is sometimes you can so be so brutally honest to somebody that you offend them and it can happen at an early age I remember the first time I was so offended I I I was invited to a party it was probably sixth grade sixth grade I don't know how old I was but I a sixth grader and we was invited to a Halloween party and we went to the party and it was a dance party where they put on M I ain't never danced in my life so they put the music on and there was a girl there named Rosemary and Rosary asked me if I would dance well I'm in a costume and I got a mask on and so yeah okay get out here and so I made a fool of myself and guess what while the music is going on I'm having a good time I'm jerking around and having a spaz attack up here and it looks like I'm convulsing over something you know but I was having fun I really was getting into it and I thought I just watched everybody else and I kind of mimic what they did and boy I I was really enjoying myself and after the dance was over and everything she came and she says you are a horrible dancer thank you yeah thank you my dancing days were over right then honestly and you know she she had been a friend up until that time and um so it was until our 10year anniversary graduation we graduated in 1971 so it was 1981 they had a high school reunion and there was Rosemary now I had not talked to her since sixth grade went through Junior High School not a word went through high school not a word see you're in the hallway I was Ice Cold Man and rosemary cornered me and said Ron can we not be friends wow don't you know what you did to me I what I'm saying is even at a very young age you can be offended enough to where you won't speak you won't talk to him you will shun them you will Harbor something in your heart when it really wasn't that big of a deal but you at the time at the moment it was a big deal here I held that in my heart all those years and I told her I said Rosemary I'm going to be honest with you remember that day Dancing Yeah I said I was having fun you said I'm a horrible dancer Ron I was I said yeah that was it over finished fenito she says didn't mean it to hurt you amen I said well you did so anyway that just goes to show it doesn't matter what age yeah right it can be just a young kid sixth grade who would think that sixth graders could hold a grudge to have resentment against someone I even had her in a couple class and and I think one time in the class she was sitting right next to me if I could have built a wall I would have built a wall but don't we build walls within our spirits and and and and and we give people the the idea don't look at me don't breathe towards me it's just little things we hold because we do not learn to forgive brother Bram said the way we have Fellowship one with another as we come under the cross then I give you the right hand of fellowship and say hey you're my brother so the same thing applies today if we want to call one another brother even those who have offended you come under the cross am yes let the Holy Spirit come into your heart and cleanse you from any kind of resentment there's always going to be someone who without disregard to someone else's feelings will say things very insensitive to others and sometimes it really isn't what you say but how you say it do you understand sometimes it's how you say it more than what you said well that's just the way that I am and if you don't like it because I just want to be honest well that kind of attitude is costic amen is repulsive some of our most outwardly religious people even within the message are guilty of seeing and all kinds of evil against others they can criticize others and look down and criticize everyone else but they cannot see the hypocrisy with it in their own life James 1 and 26 says If any man among you seems to be religious do you know any religious Believers any of you that seems to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceives his own heart this man's religion is [Music] vain James and three and I'm going to have you to read brother Mark if you would turn to James 3 with me in your Bibles let's just look at about the tongue what an unruly member it is has your tongue ever got you in trouble have you ever said something In the Heat of the Moment that you wish you could retract but once you've said it have you ever said something to somebody that once you said it and you saw the expression on on their face you knew you have just deeply wounded them hey um hey look I I I really didn't I really didn't mean that too late amen you have already spoken it you've already gutshot them nobody's Happy by a driveby shooting it happened God help us to watch our tongue amen James chapter 3 brother Mark if you would start reading and we'll go to 18 I may stop you but I don't mean to be rude but go ahead please for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same as a perfect man and able also to Bridle the whole body Bridle the whole body we offend sometimes many watch this keep going behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small Helm withs soever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth it's such a small member but it it can Kindle a great fire amen remember a fire started just by a small match so this tongue it's a small member but we've got to guard it it boasts so many things Behold a great matter a little fire kindleth verse six and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity a world of iniquity amen so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and sth on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire of hell oh it defiles the whole body set on fire of the chorus of Nature and it's set on fire of hell wow this is pretty serious Stu amen keep reading brother Mark for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil unruly evil full of deadly poison deadly poisons therewith bless we God even the father and therewith curse We Men which are made after the similitude of god notice this we can curse curse even a man who's made in the similitude of God then we turn around and bless God watch him show the analogy out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be these things ought not so to be do a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive berries either a Vine figs so can no Fountain both saltwater and fresh who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom if a man is endued with knowledge and says he's got Revelation says he a real True Believer of this message let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom go ahead brother martin but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for you see do you see this kind of wisdom it's Earthly it's devilish doesn't come down from God go ahead verse 16 for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work wow but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace blessed are the peacemakers amen for theirs is the kingdom of God listen I don't care how much that we boast oh praise God the opening of the word the seals revealed we are eating from the open book oh praise God hallelujah we're the bride of Christ we're better than everybody else oh my thank God that we are not like a denomination oh my and everything and hereby we will curse even some within the message CU they don't see it or believe it in a certain way that you do can't even call him Brother come on these things ought not to be amen [Music] for he that forgave you can only forgive you as you forgive others as I studied in the last several days I learned that in every Pagan ungodly religion they have nothing in their religion saying about forgiveness nothing in fact in the western culture that we have surrounding us we see take revenge hey baby it's payback time Western culture feeds on sex and violence amen not only do Americans condone violence we like it make my day baby am Hollywood thrives on it it's a legend of the wild w settle it with a gun we'll meet at High Noon and out in the street we go it's a natural urge to get even you do any of you have friends that you come over and you see them and you kind of suck them in the arm and they they got to hit you twice as hard back and and it's just what hey take that you you come here man boom next thing you know you're having a an issue why because you know look an eye for an eye buddy on even the law of the Old Testament let me show you speaks about seeking Vengeance for others and is pretty harsh concerning the law because in Exodus 21 verses 23 and 25 and if any mief follow then Thou shalt give Life For Life eye for eyee tooth part two hand for hand fool foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe quote for quote see what I'm saying amen many times brother Brenham said now watch we just instead of trying to find what we Fellowship around let's find something we don't Fellowship around and then I want to prove my point to you and you prove your point to me and while you're seeing your point I'm not even listening I'm looking up my next quote to go ahead and throw at him that's true huh come on then the next thing you know it breaks our fellowship and you get frustrated you become critical yeah you defile your spirit you go to church you're hearing the word and you're sitting there and somebody else is in the church and you had it out with them next thing you know they're on that corner of the church and the other one on that corner and hoping that they don't ever get seated by Brother Arnold next to you Leviticus 24:1 19- 21 and if any man cause a blemish in his neighbor as he hath done so shall it be done to him breach for breach eye for Cy tooth for tooth as he hath caused a blemish in a man so excuse me shall it be done to him again and he that kth a beast he will he shall restore and he that hath killed a man he shall be put to death now as I begin to look at this we see that this type of behavior God was showing in the Old Testament with eye for eye tooth for tooth and I want you to understand I thank God for the types in the Old Testament but when the New Testament come Christ comes with a New Covenant he says it was written that you do this Thou shalt not kill but I tell you that if a man is angry with his brother and calls him fool brother Bram said you don't have to kill a man physically you can kill him or kill his influence right right I thank God that brother Brenham tells us that Christ came to show us a better way amen turning the other cheek is not easy but it is the way of Christ amen yes amen getting and going the second mile is not easy but it is the way of Christ letting go of your temper and resentment is not easy but it is the way of Christ otherwise we can come and we can sit in church under the ministry of the word with the Holy Spirit moving among the people and you can sit there and because you have got a hardness of your heart and you are holding a grudge holding a feeling or you have a temper nobody here has a temper I'm sure you don't nobody does I I want to go over this I love the message of the hour because brother brandom even talks to us about the everyday life things that we go through yes and how that we handle them or how that we mishandle them I found a quote the other day Nikita Christa leader of the Soviet Union many years ago Nikita cha he says we Communists have much in common with the teaching of Christ my only difference with Christ is when I am struck on the right cheek by someone I strike back on the left cheek so hard that his head falls off he say you see we have something in common instead of just turning the cheek I'm going to strike harder right you follow me Jesus Christ taught and practiced self-control contr when he was riled against when all manner of evil was said against him he stood there as a lamb right you know the problem with lamb and lion is you have to know which time to be a lion and which time to be a lamb so much of the time the Bible says what blessing is it to you when people say all manner of evil against you but you did something to kind of get them to say it and you take it lightly it said but what if you do good and your good is evil spoken of and they reproach you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely then when you take it that is glory to God but that's not our nature see nonviolence and self-restraint is one of the greatest evidences of your personal character each one of you will be given tests on being offended rightfully or wrongfully you will be offended by someone at some time in your life but how you react to that offense right will display play and show the evidence of your character you have a right to react on how you want to you have a right to forgive or not the choice is yours forgiveness is a choice that you have to make true you have to learn to forgive amen you have to choose forgiveness versus Vengeance because Bible says vengeance is mine sayith the Lord I will repay you don't have to do it the time's coming remember this one thing if you do not forgive others you will not be forgiven amen forgiveness then is based upon condition am you're going to be slapped with an insult or remark sometime in your life perhaps you deserved it or you didn't deserve it doesn't matter Christ was smitten and he did not retaliate nor did he revile back here's another scriptural of example of forgiveness in the Bible brother Mark I'd like you to read if you would let's turn to the Book of Matthew chapter chap 18 verses 21- 25 the Bible is full of teaching us how to forgive amen but we've got to choose to do that that's right we sing the song to be like Jesus Oh to be like Jesus on Earth th Lord to be like him but are there are exceptions when someone offends me then I have a ride I could just keep going but you know where I'm going all right here we are Matthew 18: 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times so here's Peter I love Peter you hey man this guy offending me how many times do I have to how often do I have to forgive him yeah till seven times watch what Jesus said Jesus saith unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until 70 time 7 okay wait a second 70 time 7 anybody take math in school what does that mean 490 490 times well some of you are close you're maybe 478 so far but what I'm saying is he said Peter's asking the question how often do I forgive my brother seven times in a day no 7 times 70 49 90 times in fact there are some brothers that loved to make the score go up there are some people you are blessed to just see them come oh blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord man let's go to lunch and there are others you go hey brother no I'm busy for lunch there are some people Saints of got that are hard to get along with that's true there are some people I will never ask to go fishing with me that doesn't mean I don't love them but you understand what I'm talking about okay and so let's let's keep reading here therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven Kingdom of Heaven is likened go ahead unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him 10,000 talents 10,000 talents wow but for as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that had and payment to be made okay so now okay buddy you can't pay all right wife family kids your car everything man I'm going to you know I'm going to take it all from you go ahead the servant therefore fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him 100 P 100 and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servant saw what was done they were very sorry and came and sold unto told unto their lord all that was done then his Lord after that he had called him and said said unto him oh thou Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desired s me should us not thou also have had compassion look at this on thy fellow servant should you not have compassion even as I had pity on thee and his Lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you do unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone is brother their trespasses aren't we so quick to say Lord thank you for the grace for the Forgiveness thank you Lord oh I take it unto myself I'm forgiven hallelujah thank you Lord for your forgiveness to my debt but when somebody trespasses come [Music] on I ain't forgiving you you owe this buddy and I hope you're going to pay till the uttermost far you get this attitude you're holier than thou you're better than that person listen I ain't I ain't saying what they said or did against you was right or wrong but it's your attitude I'm dealing with amen do you understand CU otherwise we could justify an eye for an eye tooth for a tooth I tell you what and you get this attitude on you you're going to pay come on I don't have to like you I don't have to be around I could care less and get this old attitude about you forgiveness is costly it will cost you something and forgiveness is not a one-time event it is a continuing process in your life you will have to learn to forgive over and over yes and over and over yes amen again and again sometimes we say within ourselves why should I forgive don't they understand what they have done somebody has to pay for this I don't get mad I get even the old cliche we often disguise and I as our desire to get back at someone we have this Natural Instinct in nature that we want to get even your natural birth has a nature not to forgive others listen to what I said your natural birth your carnal man has a nature within it not to forgive but your spiritual New Birth yes transforms The Old Man and transforms his temperament thank you Lord yes amen hatred breeds hatred temper breeds temper why should I forgive see brother Brenham says samini in church age organization breeds hatred it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness that is why what my means this is what samna was full of bitterness a root of bitterness defiles many so more and more defilement was coming in every age would feel its scars that means lot do you see you that means during the time of we coming in the maturity of the word and we call ourselves we are no longer Church we're bride it will carry right over into this dispensation of the Bride yes bride never seeks Vengeance bride does not persecute bride before conversion you might have had a temper always sought to even the score with others but after your conversion it changes right it changes if it hasn't changed you're not born again the prophet had his conver before his conversion he got into so many fights how many knows that he list this a fighting little Irishman excuse me brother stepen little fighting fighting Irish watch this questions ansers 64 brother Brenham when someone gets on me your steps on my toes this might be a good one steps on my toes as the old saying is my temper Rises how can I overcome this thing I know the Lord will have to do it but what can I do in my heart I don't want this thing here's his answer sweeten my goodness sweeten your temper with prayer with prayer wow then make up your mind I don't guess there's too many people in this building had more temper than I did to begin with my mouth mashed all the time I'd taken a lot of my meals out of a straw my mother as you know was half Indian and my father was an Irish man a Kentucky Irish at that every both of them had enough temper to fight a buz saww that's Mom and Dad both of them and it fell down to Big Bad Bill right now I said I thought I could never be a Christian but when the Holy Spirit came into my life that done it I had a woman one time who went out to cut off the light and that day I had uh hair on top of my head she said you little kinky headed idiotic I told her I said woman you oughtn't to curse like that oh don't you fear God she said you little kinky headed idiot I if I wanted somebody to talk to me about things like that I wouldn't get a half wit like you woo come on come on man come on woman I know a man he come here woman instead of you cleaning the house I'm going to clean your clo now look he he admitted he had a temper this woman is now and and and she goes on she called me a blankety blankety name oh my have that uh been a year farther in other words if it had been before his conversion right I always said a man that is a woman Wasn't Man Enough to strike a man but I might have broke that that time calling my M calling my mother a name like that but you know what it never even phased me wow I said I'll pray for you I knowed right then something had happened to me praise the Lord you know the even that I done when I was a kid fighting almost killed five men at one time took a rifle loaded was 16 shots and when them boys beat me up because I was a Kian anybody here from Kentucky try to pick on this kcki and over here they picking on him because he was from Kentucky moved to Indiana no other reason I couldn't even hold my head up one would hold me by the hands like this the other one and stand there with a rock in his hand and pound me in the face till I was just lifeless see he would have killed those boys would he not amen amen would have killed those boys yes but God knowing that he had a work to do yeah wow watched over him wouldn't let the bullets go off cuz he got he got the rifle which one of you boys want to die first he said I got to crying then I got to screaming and laughing like a maniac how many know this a life story which one of you boys want to die first they jumping over logs and he snap snap snap not a bullet goes off then he gets mad at God why he would have killed them boys now here let me give you another example I love the transparency of the Prophet giving us life examples of things about being converted and pre-conversion and different things now brother renam in the sermon having a conference years ago I used to have an old hunting dog his name was Fritz he was half airdale and half Newland great big dog well why says he and I we go hunting I'm not going to read it all he said I go from school hunting tree and sometimes possums and skunks and what on and one day we moved into the city a policeman came by and throw a dog Button what it is that's a poison piece of meat that'll kill the animal that eats it he took a dog Button into the yard and it killed him when I come home home and buried I was about 16 17 years old I patted the last bit bit of dirt there I said Fritz I'll kill that man for that went the house got my rifle started down the police station to get him when I got in a row a little old Ford run up behind me and it was my father he grabbed that rifle out of my hand he a little bitty man slapped me upside the head and said get in that car and I went back I said Fritz went up to his grave I said Fritz here's what I'll do if pop won't let me do it that way I'll find him on the street walking someday I'll lose control of my car I promise you I'll get even with him see for killing you and I meant it wow about a year after that I was saved thank you Lord about a year later I got saved he said I led that man to the Lord hallelujah what a difference now he had it in his heart okay I I wanted to kill him my dad come got the gun said get in the car okay well here's what I'll do he premeditated murder a man after God's Own Heart David did the same thing with your right premeditated thank God for Grace amen thank God for when God comes into the heart and he takes the old Stony heart and the old vengeful heart and that that holds a grudge and Vengeance see a Christian does not have the right because you as a sheep forfeit all your rights you have no right to get even amen yes amen you have no right to be mad you have no right to sit there and harbor a grudge you have no right to say I'm going to get even you give it to God the sermon letting him up out of history in 58 he's making an altar call won't you come now while we're waiting we'll help you here in prayer prayer of faith does a lot for us won't you come I'm persuading you to come accept the god of the present time not just not just a church you you go to well I join the church that don't work Methodist God a Baptist God a presbyterian God a Pentecostal God they won't work get the God of this Bible a Pentecostal God will go right out into the world a Methodist God or a Baptist God or any other denominational God but the God of this Bible will make you like Jesus amen amen he sure will his spirit will dwell in you and all your life will be changed that temper that malice that unforgiving spirit that thing that'll caner your soul in a lost eternity an unforgiving Spirit but brother Ron I want revenge I want payment I want to Harbor this intent in my heart till it becomes a fullblown resentment it'll grow horns a tail and a pitchfork that's right yes amen it'll defile your spirit and you you'll lose the joy of the Lord a lot of people are going to church but you know what they don't have the joy anymore they've lost it cuz they're harboring something the freedom to choose to forgive will set you free into the things of the Lord and the joy of the Lord will return but until then if you Harbor that in your heart it'll defile your spirit amen cause a root of bitterness saman Church age brother B said all these little differences get all these little differences away from you little isms little funny feelings around you for Brethren and things like that shake it away don't let no root of bitterness ever get into your soul if you do it'll caner you right keep love I don't care how much people people hate you you love them anyhow amen do you want to be like Jesus what we need today among the bride around the world right now is the bomb of Gilead to come through put a healing bomb upon many of our hearts because you know what somebody has said something done something could have been friend family preacher Pastor somebody on the internet this that next thing you know you've harbored a grudge yes you've got some kind of resentment and you know what it gets in there and it defiles your spirit amen forgiveness will set your spirit free quit giving way to the devil and learn to resist his evil ways give up your own pity party and learn to forgive others well if you only yeah I don't care I shouldn't say I don't care I do care but I want to say that you're supposed to cast all your cares on him it unlocks the joy of the Lord in your life and lets the Waters of life flow freely again brother Bram said questions answers 1959 did you ever see a person have a temper fit well that's just what it is that's just when them Devils that's what happened to them you ever seen one of them having a temper fit you say oh uhhuh I know what happened in Gat now see that's is exactly just a few come in here run them completely insane of course the medical doctor will tell you that temper is the first stage of insanity wow that's what Mayo says first stage of insanity now I will tell you if any of you have ever lost control of your temper and you were in a fight I can only relate this to you one time in my life I went to Monrovia High School and we had racial riots I've played sports with all of my black friends but when it comes down to having white versus black we had racial riots we were the worst school in LA county for racial riots racial tension and one day we had this confrontation whites versus blacks and we're standing there and all the time there's this hey guy hey I tell you what come on over here you think you bad come on man so I remember getting into a race riot I remember fighting and I remembered yes and when the only thing I can liken it to is to hand toand combat in war about an hour and a half later I come out of it I don't know where I'd been for the last hour and a half I have no recollection my friend said wow cuz they're trying to pull me away and I'm I I'm just I'm I'm I'm nuts I lost it that was prior to my conversion temper will drive you insane amen hatred feeling like you got to get after somebody go after them yeah brother Bram said in the infallibility of God's word God don't want you to be sad you know what temper does that old temper that one of the aess old things about 60% of the cause of all sickness is temper wow now this is coming from a man who's got Divine Healing with a gift to pray for the sick he said 60% of all those that come up the sickness was called where it's cause here's the root cause temper you say see Tantrums you fly loose remember you just developing a cancer an ulcer or something like that when you do it when you get all stewed up about somebody I won't let uh I I won't go back there anymore wait till I give them a piece of my mind all right remember you're the one that's going to pay for it do you see that here he our Prophet is saying oh you're getting mad at them and they you know I want to give them a piece of my mind and he says guess what he says you're the one that's going to pay for it help me Lord amen sir to lay all of everything before you and give it to you the Bible says in Ephesians 4:26 and 27 be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil anger and resentment are symptoms that's always accompanied unforgiveness let me say it again anger and resentment accompany unforgiveness there are different kinds of degrees of anger like on a thermometer let me just go over this quickly you start at the bottom with the thermometer and you rise to the top the bottom is that icy cold anger what we or many will call indifference I don't care I don't care about others I could care less you got this cold Icy indifference you become cold silent like a frosty morning and you got no jacket you give the cold shoulder and you give the icy stairs you ever known somebody to do that you ever felt it huh rising up you come to the normal temper of anger it causes IR ability bitter words sharp words you become impatient critical and with heated words of anger it causes you to lose your joy and become frustrated at everything then we go all the way to the top with boiling and scalding words of anger so when the face gets red and the eyes bulge the veins pop go ahead make my day this kind of anger blows up it's explosive and gets physically abusive it is the seething cauldron of terrible outrage no one blows up nicely that's right forgiveness is not a one-time gift but that is imparted to you it's not one time right must be given in every circumstance that arises against you and you must learn how to forgive so that you can be forgiven you want everyone to be lenient on your transgressions don't you oh thank you Lord you forgiven me oh thank you Lord we're so easy on oursel and so hard on others amen there are steps to forgiveness I'll try to come to a close here is this okay amen very good because as a pastor as a pastor I feel no matter how religious we seem to be no matter how much we talk about predestinated elected ordained of God you're going to have to guard yourself against being unforgiving amen true holding a grudge got hatred resentment want Vengeance those things should not be [Music] there are steps to forgiveness number one you have to release the pain of the past it's not that you say it didn't happen no it happened what happened happened I can't help it we can't go back but you must live in the now and not in the past or you'll be an emotional merry go around seeming to try to get away from the past but it keeps coming back around then you're reminded one thing about the devil is he doesn't let you forget huh throws it back in your face you oh you see the person oh do you see them huh do you remember yeah yeah next thing you know you walk around you don't shake their hand you don't say hello to them I wonder what's going to happen with some if you get over into the New Jerusalem and that happens to be your neighbor right now brother R says remember only those who have perfect love will be there come on now Saints didn't say perfect Doctrine come on come on now he said you got to have perfect love amen an agapo love not a fileo love right an agapo love amen one that love will cover a multitude of sins and you will be able to forgive and let go so you have to release the pain of the past unreleased pain becomes the hatred of tomorrow it is a Fest ing wound any of you ever seen a festering wound where you get a sliver or something up in the arm or in the hand and next thing you know it gets big and puffy and pusses coming out of it you go to the doctor and your hand is now all swollen doct says hey you know what's wrong you got you got something down here in your hand we're going to have to open it up so they give you a shot of Nova cane or whatever and they take the scalpel like this and all of a sudden all this comes out and and you know what it might have been just a small tiny sliver wasn't that big of a thing most of the time our big festering issues within our families and within our lives are little issues amen that's right he said she said he did she did and really when you get right down to it it's just a little matter but the way you get rid of that you open the wound you take out that foreign matter you cleanse it and sometimes the doctor doesn't close it up with sutures he leaves an open wound and lets it heal from the inside out amen number two you have to regain the attitude of Love by reconciliation there's got to be a Reconciliation amen forgiveness cannot take place until love is extended to the transgressor oh you can say I no I don't even accept it I don't like the way you said forgive me you're you're not growling enough huh that's right it's on condition come on when love projects divine grace takes over thank you Lord amen love covers a multitude of sin number three restore the fellowship extend to him the hand of Fellowship as though he had never done it good that's it real justification amen let us do it one with another cuz God did it with you thank you Lord I gave him my old tattered garment he gave me a robe of pure white number four reopen yourself to Future involvement in other words don't keep them at arms length the rest of your life amen open yourself up to Future involvement Show Yourself friendly if you want friends hang around after church for a little bit some of you are so unfriendly we start say we're closing now off you go there are some of you I haven't got to shake your hand in a year because if I'm five minutes late coming out there or whatever hey I could even stand at the back door and some of you go out the side [Music] door I'm not on your case I'm just saying oh God let this church not be one that ever holds a grudge let there not be anything Among Us especially in the house of God okay friends or family yes sir sometimes we hold grudges against family yes sir right and they're even of the household of faith you think you can stand in the presence of God and hold that Grudge sorry number five restoration of Fellowship by celebration in other words Hey Brother let's celebrate our friendship I'm so glad that we have restored our friendship amen there's nothing worse than family being divided I've seen it within the message you know I've told you saints that pastoring the church in the 21st century the easiest part of that pastoring is preaching because that's a gift but to keep the sibling rivalries down among you where you be friends with one another or friends with others within the household of God don't ever get some self-righteous Spirit on you but humble yourself Amen in the sight of God hang around you want to you want friends some of you are alone in a big church because you don't show yourself friends you want people to go to lunch with hang around right hey buddy how you doing shake hands share some of the fellowship you got in your life amen don't be so quick to leave there are some that you know what I wonder can't you stay for a couple minutes can't you shake hands can't we shake hands one with another and I don't want us to be divided even by race or culture right and I know a lot of times and I say this and I wish to God that I spoke French well enough that when I came over to my French Believers I was able to say more than uh do you Benise or Kam saah I wish that I could really sit down and fellowship with you in French and I feel bad that I cannot but I will not let that stop me to be able to come up and hug your neck shake your hand I don't want you isolated on the right side of the church and the whites over on the other side amen mingle take some of our African Believers out to lunch with you amen amen amen amen same way with our African Believers invite some of the whites Mingle and I thank God for our African Believers here in this church I love you guys I do some of my best friends in high school were black when I go to Congo and I leave the airport I'm usually the only white guy I see for two weeks stand out like a a beacon and some of the brothers says brother Ron are you uncomfortable I said no sir I'm not I said I feel very comfortable I come to your home take my shoes off eat your food eat your foofoo I love you guys amen I had a friend of mine Russell Hurst he was a a low hurdler one of the best in the state of California I was catcher on the varsity team and I'm catching backing batting practice and our hurdlers are doing their their track is right next to us well anyway I hear this guy tumble and fall it was Russell Hurst he had hit the high the low hurdle with his heel and over he went when I went to him he's screaming ah like that he almost had a compound fracture and he he broke the femur here and it was almost coming out of his skin I said hang on Russell man I got you I got you I said go go tell the coach I said get an ambulance over here here about 15 years later my father had had a cranial hematoma we took him to the hospital had to have operation and we're in where he comes out of the recovery room and he's on the bed and there's a man an orderly who's got the mask on and all you know how they do with the hair nets and and got the scrubs and he's pushing uh and they said uh Mr Peterson yeah okay so we heard his name so they were taking him to his room and so we get in the elevator together and were talking one to another my brother and I and the black guy who was the orderly said hey you the brvs and he took his mask down Russell amen I tell you what here we were hugging one another talking about I was wondering what you guys are doing he said I always admired you guys and you get this and that went on and on and I tell you what and we're hugging over my dad my dad's like I want you guys to know that our church I love the fact that we are a mixed congregation I love that I'm not trying to make our blacks white and whites black no I'm not you are what you are you got your culture praise the Lord be happy of your culture amen okay but I say let's let's mix a little bit more one with another I'm just saying that okay so anyone that wants me to go to lunch with them today mark 11 says musicians if you come please Mark 11 25 and 26 when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses identified with Christ he says I want to be like him that's my desire to be able to turn the other cheek or go the Second Mile be able to forgive when odds is all against you hold nothing against anybody though they're mistreating you rightfully or wrongfully For Your Right doing but still love them amen that's the way I want to be amen me too I would rail not back that's the kind of example that God gave us in Jesus Christ we ought to be identified with him Luke 6:37 says judge not and you shall not be judged condemn not and you shall not be condemned [Music] forgive and you shall be forgive thank you [Music] Lord thou son of David have mercy on me brother Bram [Music] said I wasn't sure I sure wouldn't go on preaching till I went first and made that right see if I could get straightened up cuz we're not supposed to have anything against anyone or anything we can do let no one have anything against us see it doesn't say if you have ought against a brother but if the brother has ought against thee see yeah go to him if he has the ought that way why we live peaceably Ephesians 4:32 be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you amen Colossians 3: 13 and 14 forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do [Music] youen above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness there is only one sin that cannot be forgiven the sin of blasphemy these scoffers and false accusers here that are rising up now and sending out their YouTubes and all of their hate mail and everything against this Prophet brother R said if you don't agree with it don't say anything against it that's right that that woman at time looked at the picture of the pillar of fire on someone's mantle looked at it and she she she laughed he said she blasphemed the Holy Ghost Matthew 12:31 and 32 wherefore I say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy me against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it should be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to [Music] come now let me just give you this one quote here because I I want to when I read it it really spoke Queen of the South he said that he perceiving their thoughts in their heart they said this man's a faker he's a beelove what a spirit to be on a person Jesus knew it said you can call the son of man that kind of a name it'll be forgiven you but when the Holy Ghost has come and you speak that against him it'll never be forgiven you in the moment moment forgiven you in this world or in the world to come weigh that in the balance for a few moments and think what that means it shall be never be forgiven to man to blaspheme against the Holy Ghost because they said this is an unclean Spirit now many of you have wondered what is the unpardonable sin there it is he says so I'm going to the bottom of this paragraph So look the scripture is the background Jesus said if you speak a word against the Holy Spirit it shall never be forgiven you all sin shall be forgiven except that sin that's unbelief oh what a horrible thing that unbelief is and the most unbelievers are religious people the most unbelievers I quote again it's religious people it's been in every age and this age is no exception it's religious people who are unbelievers and each one of these guys that are coming against the message oh they claim to be real Christians we want to expose what this Prophet has done where he made all these mistakes let me just close close with this cuz I think this is very mindful I'm not going to read it I'll just put it back into your remembrance there was a man in the scripture who was rejected by his Brethren sold into slavery put into a pit told her father he was dead who was it Jose Joseph if anybody could inact Revenge man you talk about a perfect setup here he is he is there he's at the right hand of pharaoh and he's got his brothers there and they don't know who he [Music] is Joseph could have thought within himself ha he who laughs last laughs best it's amazing because he put out all the Egyptians and then he begins to speak Hebrew takes off his hat I'm Joseph your brother did they Rejoice what did they say he's going to kill us man he's going to enact Vengeance on us right Jacob has just [Music] died and Jacob told the Brethren to say this jacob says to say to [Music] Joseph so you shall say unto Joseph forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy Brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespasses of the Servants of the god of thy father [Music] and Joseph wept he says you thought to do evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as in this day to save much people alive here was a man that could have at that very moment could have said I got him man I'm going to put you guys in prison I'm going to make you pay the price cuz this is what you did to me but Joseph is a perfect type of Christ Joseph Perfection Joseph's greatest [Music] act in the whole time of his Reign was forgiving his brethren that's the greatest act and I thank God that he gives us example after example of learning to forgive thank you Lord so I say this to all of you this morning as the Lord had put this on my heart and I didn't speak this because somebody's coming talk to me or this family's having an argument no no no no this been on my heart for weeks weeks even Sandy kept asking me are you going to preach on the last part of the heart and forgiveness I said yeah the Lord willing that may not seem like a real big spiritual thing but I want you to know if there's anybody here right now yes I want you to judge yourself I want to look I want you to not think about anybody else I want to think about you because now you are the ruler of your home you are the possessor of your kingdom and you look in your heart and say do I have a to resentment or hatred do I have something in my heart that I'm not forgiving someone else judge yourself right now and if you ask God to forgive you then you forgive the others that trespassed against you amen that's the spirit of God I could ask you hey how many of you f no no no no I'm just saying right here right now with you looking at me with the musicians playing judge your heart [Music] and if something in your mind says yeah [Music] yeah you're right brother Ron oh I have to let go am and you judge yourself you have to learn to forget and so maybe after the service is over and the next day or so or later today it doesn't matter why don't you make those things right go to family say hey we're family we're brothers and sisters in Christ I'm not going to hold this hey let's let let's go on unto Perfection forgetting those things that are in the past let's go on let's speak good things Peaceable things let's say good things about one another because God that has forgiven you yes sir if he's forgiven you
