a new little baby here Johan Daniel do you say Johan is that how you say it Johan because they spell it with a y o h n and Daniel and Hebrew it means god is gracious and God is merciful and Daniel is Hebrew also is God is my judge amen and so may I have the little one this morning here let's turn him the other way right here oh yeah yeah he's got a bow tie huh we don't want to wake him up yeah we want him to rest just come a little closer here we know that every good gift that God gives it comes with a great responsibility the Bible says that we are to raise our children up in the admonition and nurture of the Lord You've named him well you've given him scriptural names that have a a meaning God being gracious God being his judge so we're asking in this hour when this is such a wicked and adulterous generation may this little Johan Daniel may he walk in the light of the hour of what which that we know is called the message of the hour may he be a mighty Gentile Warrior may he stand for those things of God if God carries his coming but we believe that he's coming soon but until then we will do all that we can to raise our children in the things of God Amen Let Us bow our heads together together if you would please kind Heavenly Father brother leas and sister Rachel now bring their newborn son Johan Daniel to be dedicated before you and we would ask father even as the scripture says and they brought unto him little children that he might bless them and he took them up in his arms and the disciples were upset they said why is he doing that and he said except that you come as a little child you shall no in no wise see the kingdom of God and then he took them up and he blessed them Father in thy stead I am now holding this young child and dedicating him back to you for a life of service may you bless him abundantly father watch over him and keep him father because we know that we have not the power to keep ourselves but we are kept by the power of God I pray that you keep a hedge about him father and I pray that his little eyes father will see the glory of God I pray that his ears will hear the word which will give him uh overcoming power father and Revelation to strike his little heart and his life father to live a life that would be pleasing to you may these little feet stand on every promise may they walk into that great uh kingdom of God into that New Jerusalem father and may they possess every gate of the enemy I pray I dedicate little Johan Daniel now to you for a life of service we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen yes okay yeah you only have two arms and you have to when the kids and they they want you and they want to there you go God bless you God bless you can you greet me yeah okay bless you God bless you Sister Rachel God bless you okay praise the Lord amen God is good I want to say Happy Thanksgiving to all of you there if I don't have an opportunity may you have a very blessed time with your family and loved ones

Gustaf pankin and he he slipped in and uh slipped out with my not getting him to preach that won't happen again by God's grace even if he sneaks in and I'm already in the P but I'll say oh guess what there's another brother here this morning yeah anyway God bless brother gusta sister anetta may God be with them and and John and Ina God bless them too may take our blessings back with you back to Holland and each and everyone it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning now yesterday afternoon I was seeking God what can I say to your people what is it father that I can say that will be a help that will be something to strengthen them to see this hour in which we live and realizing that the enemy is doing everything that he can to try to dissuade to discourage to become a distraction so that we don't stay focused on the things because really what it's all about is Rapture or bust I don't want second place if you're going to run run to gain the prize if you're going to fight fight to win second place means tribulation that's where foolish virgin is headed God don't let there be one here found foolish on that day I pray that you give them the the isv of understanding give them the wisdom that's beyond that of Solomon the wisdom that is the very mind of Christ let us all Stand Together thank you musicians I just feel I've got quite a bit to go to so instead of singing we'll just go right into it God bless you I enjoyed the song special now the Bible shows us where everything has a beginning brother Brenham said there is a a book in the Bible it's called The Book of Beginnings what what what book is that in the Bible Genesis Genesis so we find that everything begins in Genesis that which begins in Genesis goes all the way through like a thread all the way down to the Book of Revelation so turn with me if you would to Genesis chapter 10 verses 8-10 gen genis CH 10 verse 8 and Kush begat Nimrod and he beg to be a mighty one on the earth and he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said even as Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel where we get Babylon where did this start in Babel where did it come from seed of the serpent all the way down that's why we're in a modern-day Babylon Revelation chapter 17 if you would please Revelation 17: 1-6 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great whr that sth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abomination ations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her head was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration may God add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning like to title my sermon this morning America a modern day Babylon I'd like to take a subject this morning of the handwriting on the wall now I just want to say before we get into this let me say a little bit of a precedent of what's happening in America today we just had an election and Donald Trump won by a majority vote but I don't want you to relax your spirits I don't want you to sit back and say oh okay we have a little bit more time because the way America is going is down and we do not put our trust in the system or in Trump amen okay it's kind of bad when you have to vote for the lesser of two evils is which what we have done and if you'll note he was raised Presbyterian his wife is the first Catholic first lady since um John F Kennedy's wife Jacqueline Kennedy and so the powers that are in there are not godly Powers they are puppets figureheads understand that even Trump he may be a better choice in what I would say Camala would be but Amica America is never going to change you think uh America is going to be great again she's done she's on her way down and I I want all of you to understand that because the times are going to get rougher this is not a sermon all of you are going to dance out of here shouting Hallelujah I know that it's going to be a warning thank you Lord It's going to be a declaration to you your family because the enemy is doing everything he can and people think well I can just walk away from the message and okay and I'll just go to another church do you realize that this message exposed to us that who was this great Harlot this in the Book of Revelation who sits upon many Waters with your people who hasn't a cup in her hand the cup of her filthiness and her Abominations so anything that she gives to the people that doctrinal incorrect teaching will lead to spiritual fornication that's right so you there is no clean tables outside of this word of God they're all full of vomit brother random said the devil travels in the name father son Holy Ghost so you leave this message where are you going to go to well I'll go to a a Feelgood church one that will not preach Holiness will not preach the thing things against sin why because they starting from the top down are guilty of those things so they just preach another Jesus so the Lord started dealing with my heart yesterday afternoon and it came to me about in the time of Daniel in the time of Babylon remember that now the Jews have been dispersed carried away down into captivity but even remember that during any dispensational change God was doing a dispens ational change you understand from the Jews now to Gentiles but there is a man there a Prophet by the name of Daniel and God is going to use him to speak even to the to those in power at that time and there was a handwriting on the wall and it troubled the king and he said if there's anyone that can decipher this handwriting on the wall I will make him you know chief of the religious people in the country of that time I want you to know that we've had one like an un Daniel and he and he said America understand there's a handwriting on the wall and kabad has been written over you I'm going to substanti apprciate some of this stuff CU I want you to understand the seriousness of this message and if you think that you can just leave quote the message because the message is Christ do we understand it it is the Christ of this hour and to leave it you go and you can live any kind of life you want to women you can cut your hair wear makeup paint your toenails fingernails you can wear clothes that is an Abomination to God you can wear immoral clothing and you can go to the church and'll never be talked about but you love Jesus don't you because God's going to he's just going to love you anyway that's the kind of thinking that Cain had God will accept any sacrifice that I give to him how many of them say Lord Lord but Jesus will say in that day many will come unto me in that day and saying Lord have we not done this in your name done that in your name and he will say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you I never conceived you amen I love where Jesus says you call me master and Lord you say well for so I am am but I want to ask you how many of you have made him not just your Lord but your master to do what he would want you to do so many call him Lord because they want fire insurance they don't want to go to hell so I'm just going to you know I'll call him Lord I'll get baptized and I'll become religious and uh you know I I I'll try to keep keep the Ten Commandments I've met so many people say hey I I'm a Christian I've never killed anybody you know just you know they they go to extremes on stuff like that but what about and I want to I want to ask all of you what is this message in this hour what's it done for you what are you doing with it are you eating it are you taking the book that is now open in the hand of him who sat upon the throne remember in Revelations chap 5 it was a closed book so between Revelation CH 5 and Revelations chap 10 there was a there was a happening an event because remember John was so distraught there was no one in heaven or on Earth to take the book The Book of redemption brother BR said two parts toed Redemption first part is Calvary second part is to redeem that which Calvary purchased hallelujah amen understand that this message that has been brought to us is not to be just condensed down to a few rules women don't cut your hair don't weigh makeup this that boys don't wear shorts we go to church we pay our ties that's it this message is Christ and Christ is a person it's a spirit and as I was meditating and seeking God the thought came to me that God is his own interpreter absolutely God interprets his word by bringing it to pass and I think that there's been so much confusion down Through the Ages starting from Genesis all the way down because different ones have taken the word of God and put their interpretation to it if God is going to come why surely he's going to come to probably the pope he's going to come to him first because he's the vicer of God of course God and and probably the ramparts of heaven will open and we'll see him come down and there'll be trumpets and all kinds of stuff and we'll know and that that's his second coming the Bible says he'll come like a thief in the night so we know there are several comings in the scripture I'm not getting into that this morning but God interprets his word by bringing it to pass so God doesn't need your help if he gives us a word that they'll be rapturing faith we don't have to work it up brother Brenham said rapturing faith is in you now it is not something that uh you're going to find mysteriously one day and say oh that's rapturing Faith now I got it no it's in you because it lays inside of you because of a seed and because of that seed God watches over that seed because he made a covenant with our Father Abraham and he said I'm going to give you an unconditional covenant thank you Lord now if you take that and you preach it that you can do anything and and live any kind of life you want to and say that God is going to take you to heaven then you make God's grace disgrace but I do believe and I'm guess I'm going to throw something out here now that God watches over his seed regardless of what you do and he may make you suffer for the incorrect decisions but you're still going to make it Hallelujah why because God watches over his predestinated elect seed he's watching over it when Abraham lied God did not say Okay Liars will not make it you're out Abraham when David committed adultery he didn't say okay no adulterers will make it you're out David no there was a mediator there for everyone of them there was an advocate do you understand we have a high priest we have an advocate we have one that intercedes for us when we do wrong Hallelujah who can lay any charge any sin to the elect of God oh you make mistakes but you don't sin amen you understand that sin is unbelief but you believe but you make mistakes yet at the end of the road guess what huh Brother Andy we win never forget that Andy came to me one day he says brother honor I I read the end of the book we win little things like that little nuggets of life I want all of you to understand no matter what you go through no matter how dark the day no matter how much the opposition against you no much no matter how much the persecution no matter how hard it may look God is with you he will be with you even in you until the end of the world so therefore you have an assurance hey this is not from what man is telling you it's what God's telling you I'll be with you second Peter chapter 1 I haven't even started preaching I'm just trying to relax my spirit I I I came here and I had printed out my notes at home but guess what my printer was out of red and yellow ink and so everything that I had that had red was missing you know all I did is grab my notes come here and so I went back to yes yes you got to help me out here buddy okay where'd you put it I don't know it's it's on my computer well it's where where was it was it G Drive was it Google Drive yeah that's a mystery so anyway he found it he sent it to the printer he printed it out I said you're my hero WR today so I'm a little bit nervous because those kind of things I don't like to make mistakes and I don't like to have things don't go exactly the way that I want it to but that's life huh that's life is that with your life also hey guess what you're going to have issues you're going to have things come up you're going to have have things thrown at you you're going to fall you're going to make a mistake you're going to say and do things wrong but guess what God's with you and if you're his guess what you're going to get a spank it that's all five-fold Ministry okay and it's not going to be over top of a big thick pamper no you pull it down and get a little bit of skin now ain't child abuse that's child training amen second Peter chapter 1 let me go on now if I can here and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mountain we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you Do Dwell that you take heed you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in the dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so I want you to understand all the way from Genesis to Revelation whenever a prophetic word comes there's always those that try to figure it out or say well this is that and I say unto all of us here let us be extremely careful even with this message and with different things because sometimes it looks like it could be but if the prophet didn't tell it if he didn't expose it and say this is that then what we do we just leave it alone because I want a sure foundation so I say that to all of our ministers let's stay on that solid what we know to be the revealed word am and not try to get out and try to impress us with some kind of spiritual something let's stay simple amen all right you know I one of the first lessons I learned when I came into this message was different ones started taking and interpreting the word to us and I've told you about this but I'm going to show you in the scriptures where this brother got it so in Revelations chapter 9 verses 7-10 now I'm going to put a disclaimer here because I don't want somebody on the internet to take this and say this is what brother Ron is teaching this is what was taught to me incorrectly because you know the Beatles are in the Bible huh what's another word for Beetle Locust okay so let's read this revelation of The Beatles in the Bible revelations 9 7-10 and the shapes of the Locust were like Into Horses prepared under battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were the faces of men and they had hair like the hair of what women and their teeth was the teeth of lions she loves you yeah yeah yeah okay I'm wanting you to just catch this this is what I was told and wow here's an old test here's a Old Testament Prophet as he's seeing things or a new testament I should say as he's seeing something and these brothers were interpreting this to me and I'm going wow and they had breastplates and the breastplates were of iron what is it what is that that's a guitar okay and the sound of their wings was as the sound of Chariots of many horses running to battle do you see that and had tails had tails like under scorpions and there were sting in their tails that's the cord going to the amplifier wow are you guys impressed yeah Circle that in you put the Beatles tell everybody about it no that's incorrect it may sound good wow without any kind of Revelation without the prophet tell did the prophet tell us that no but he did say that the Beatles weren't even in God's thinking and he says talking about anointing he says they're Anointed with their music so much so that the next thing that they could do is go and start a healing campaign how many of you know that because people were just so inspired so enamored by them just because of their music so I wanted to just show you that you can type something out it may look like oh wow that that's pretty good but if the prophet didn't say it we don't say it amen just giving you an idea of some of those things in fact much of the time just throwing this out here now and understand this that the false doctrines and isms within this message are always somebody misinterpreting or self interpreting something the prophet said tent vision return ministry right any we we could take all of these and you could you could take each one of these and see that somebody made a little ISM I want to call it an ism did a grafted in Branch onto the tree and they say they're living off of this message and they are because the what it is it's a grafted in Branch but they're living off of the true message you follow me now do you remember that tree that brother Brenham I think it was down in Tucson that brother had a citrus tree and he grafted in all kinds of different Citrus branches into I believe the original tree was an orange tree and this man had grafted in lemons grapefruit tangerines all different kinds of citrus branches and brother Bram said wow so this this is brings forth tangerine and this Branch brings forth grapefruit and everything yes yes and he says oh my Hallelujah and he says well brother let brother br's asking him the question okay so next year next year when all the leaves go down and you know it goes down into the winter time and when the springtime comes again it'll every Branch will be oranges he said no because whatever is grafted into it will live off of the life of the True Vine are we together so brother bram's saying oh wow look at this if we graft something into this message by self-interpretation or wrong interpretation ation and we say well this is it this is whatever Doctrine we want to call it and then next thing you know we are living off of the life of the message but bringing forth the wrong fruit so in 1 Peter 1: 9-13 I'm showing you how that when scripture came and Men of God were moved of the L of the Lord to speak the word of God 1 Peter 1:9 and receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently because they prophesied it now they're searching diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify in other words this prophetic word they said something it was thus sayith the Lord God is going to do something and so they sought diligently they searched when is this going to happen and when it testified beforehand the suffering of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things in other words they prophesied it but it was for us which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into wherefore G up the Lins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of of Jesus Christ many people ask me oh you're a you're a pastor you're a Christian yes sir I am what what kind of Christian are you what what kind of church do you have what denomination I said we're not a denomination well that you know that they can't figure that out because everybody got a categorize something okay are you you know in in Germany they only have two categories Protestant and evangelic or Catholic see and and so you know they they don't understand non- denomination when I first went to Germany what you're kids either Protestant or Catholic which which are you we're we're neither no no understand here in Germany you have to be one or the other and they tax you accordingly you know they take your taxes out they're ties out of your salary automatically either to the Catholic church or to the Protestant church so you just tell them so you don't even get a choice yeah you don't even get a choice well let me see I made $300 this week so I'll give 30 no no I'll give $29 or I'll give 25 because it how would you like us to do that Robert we don't need to do that you don't want to go there we could make money buddy huh I wonder how some of you pay your ties like you do your taxes I didn't make no money after all of my deductions do you pay it on the gross or the net hey why are you so quiet let me tell you you can't outg give God ties belong to God your offerings is after you've paid your ties do you know brother R said you can't even pay an offering unto the Lord until you've paid up your ties God help us and I'm not I didn't mean to go there and everything and I don't preach on tithing but it is part of the word of God Amen I believe that Christians pay their ties they do it amen all right so the people ask me what kind of church you well we're non- denomination well uh okay um well what kind of a Christian are you well I'm a born again Holy Ghost filled Bible believing Christian I'm a Apostolic I'm Pentecostal I'm Catholic I'm Baptist I'm Lutheran as long as you stay with the word of God because brother Brenham said that one time he said well I'm a Baptist Catholic Lutheran you know he said as long as you stay with the word you see what happened with each one of those is each one of those came under some kind of inspiration well we'll become lutherans we'll become methodists we'll become this and that and the next thing you know they took a group of people and pulled them away from the main group of Christians and down Through the Ages we have all of the different interpretations and so I've been wondering what is happening even now in this hour among our message churches could it be that some are making their own interpretation pulling off groups of people isolating them and saying we have it we're the ones and they're excommunicating anybody that doesn't believe leave just like them in fact you're out now I love brother brenham's spirit because the spirit he had was the spirit of Christ is that right let me give you an example when Junior Jackson and Don rutle split from Brother Brenham they were his sister churches how many of you know that he said they're our sister churches they've been there for years now brother Brenham preaches Church order and he sets the gifts in order and he makes people accountable for what they do with the gifts are we aware of that okay and they didn't like it so they pulled away from Brother Brenham they no longer went to Brenham Tabernacle so they took their people and the deacons really they started going after the Believers of Junior Jackson and and Don rutle and they were calling them dirty birds and all and brother Brenham comes to the pulpit he said now Brethren keep your mouths off them Junior Jackson believes this message as much as I do if he wants to have the gifts of tongues and interpretation and that working in his church that's his problem you understand he he didn't he didn't put him down he didn't try to expose how wrong they were or they left they went out from among us because they were not us he kept the right attitude God help us to have the right attitude that we not get this self-righteous I'm better than you or I see it more than you in fact humility can be found by the greater revelation of Jesus Christ when it comes into you does that make you a stuffed shirt does it make you a Know It All In fact when the wheat is full and ready for Harvest what does it do I will say this the more that I understand this message and the more that God opens to me the revelation of Jesus Christ the more I realize oh God you humble me I realize lord it's you I am so humbled before you that's the reason brother Brenham okay when those men and they came and they were so heart against him and said we want to pray for you cuz your your your Doctrine is Antichrist you know what he did he humbled himself right he said uh well Brethren he said you know I don't know now watch him watch him I don't know the Bible real well I don't I'm ignorant unlearned I got a seventh grade education I'm not like you guys he said but I know the author and when they got done and they prayed for him well brother Bren there's one thing we can say about you you have the spirit of Christ I'm going to make a challenge to each one of you when was the last time time somebody saw you in a situation and you acted correctly and you did right because the Bible says when they say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake he said you should take it right if somebody asks of your coat or if they ask you to go two miles one mile go two if somebody slap AB your face do what turn the cheek this is Christianity 101 what about you and I yeah somebody disagree with us why we want to hack them up and kick them out and no brother brim said you can come here to this church even if you disagree with me just don't sew Discord right that's all hey brother ramam said I like cherry pie right he said when I eat cherry pie and I come to a seed I spit it out I don't throw away the pie that's how it is it should be with all of us and the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm going to lay my heart out this morning the Bride of Jesus Christ is United together they have a Unity around the word can you say Amen they are not divided they are one one Lord One Faith one baptism amen right then why are we divided because we have interpretations I say father help us to get away from interpretations and and this is how I see it and it's it can be no other way and if somebody sees it other than that then I'm going to call him out no pray for him that's all pray for them and love them because the Bible says love your that's not easy I've realized that recently I've gone through a few things my nature is by nature and excuse me I'm a fighter you get me up against the wall you push my button we got an issue okay but when the spirit of Christ comes I'm not the lion I'm the lamb there is a time in all of your lives when you know which you are to be to stand up for your rights and say this and get in their face and if you don't see it my way get out of the way or you say brother just pray for me amen I love you anyway and you don't write them off because you know what let me let me say how quick can Revelation come to a Believer instantly you mean to tell me somebody that's been off for a period of time in the message and they've made a certain way in they're kind of holding on to it and it's this my way or the highway and then all of a sudden God changes their mind instantly can God do that sovereignly amen what we need among this message right now is another move of the Holy Ghost is a real downpouring of the Holy Ghost cuz the Holy Spirit will lead you and guide you into all truth and he shall testify of himself amen right now America is in a transition she's in a transformation right now America is experiencing a religious Revolution we're in spiritual warfare as we've never been before things against Christianity and anti-Semitism are on the rise every other religion has their rights but Christians have no rights Jews are being hated just for the fact they're a Jew I walked through the gates of aitz there in Poland a couple times and above the gate there it says arbite M work makes freedom and they sent them from all of the different parts of Europe north south east and west and they brought them in on rail cars no food no water no gas station and they put him to the concentration camp and actually what it was it's called a death camp because they said the only way you're getting out of awit is through the smoke of the crematorium I've been there I've seen the places where they shot them they suffocated them they starved them because they were a Jew not because of something they did understand this what is coming upon America is a spirit that is going to rise up you see it in its infancy form right now true let me let me give you a quote on this so you know where I'm at why we are not a denomination you ever heard that sermon why we are not a denomination whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornications and the inhabitants of the Earth have made drunk with the wine of her fornication her wine is what she's giving out her stimulation we are the church we are the the ones that got it now just draw that in your mind now all right so he carried like the angel told John I will show you this judgment that's coming to this great church now watch so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sitting Upon A Scarlet colored Beast scarlet and the Bible represents Royal the color Scarlet means red and the Beast represents power did you notice the Beast come up out of the sea that was in Revelations the 13th and when you see the Beast coming out of the sea it's meant that this power was Rising among the people but in Revelations 13 when the lamb came up he came up out of the earth no people United States but then after he had two little horns civil and the ecclesiast astical Powers then he received the power and spoke like the dragon look at this going to turn from a lamb it looked like a lamb brother Ram said those two little horns he said they were seeing the American buffalo yes sir he said civil and ecclesiastical Powers it starts out like a lamb religious freedom but wait when she turns and speaks like a dragon okay watch this see Power spoke like the dragon did before him so you just got to mark it down we're coming into a religious persecution with the same things they did in Pagan Rome many years ago for it's thus sayith the Lord wow that doesn't sound very nice does it do you know what they did in Pagan Rome to Christians any of you ever been to the Coliseum in Rome yes I walked through the Coliseum with Brother Joseph brandham he and I were there one time the tour guide said this is the Gate of life and this is where all the people the Gladiators the martyrs everybody walked through the gate of life and they had to turn towards Caesar and say hail Caesar and said there's two gates that you go in and out of and said you either go back out the gate of life cuz you live through it or you're carried through the gate of death I've been there I've walked into that Coliseum where there was 65 80,000 people and I could just imagine them all cheering brother random calls American football uh a modern day Gladiator Spirit when they see somebody get hit and blood on the field blood makes the grass grow it is kill him get him knock his head off I've walked there were Christians LED out there with families mommies and daddies with their children walk out there and they stand there as a family unit and they open the doors and these lions that have not been fed for a week or two and they're just ravenous beasts and they see them standing there and a father will stand in front of his family bear his chest eat me First Take Me First and the people died and the more that they killed the more the people friends here is what the guide told me that absolutely excuse me for a lack of a better word it blew my mind he said the reason they stopped killing all of the martyrs because it was making Christianity grow it said by the time there was such a presence of those Martyrs that stood there willing to give their life for what they believed that there were Roman citizens who were not Christians come down out of the stands and stood with them to be bared they said The more we killed the more came to be killed think of that persecution brings out the best in the church we don't have it hard enough that's right because we got it too easy it's too easy we can come to church sit on a nice padded chair you didn't have to walk to church I don't think any of you had to walk I've been in Africa where I go and you know what they don't have pews they a little 2x4 you know what a 2x4 is they sit it down there and they got a they got a log cut and they put a 2x4 over and the people sitting there it ain't very comfortable and they said brother Ron don't give us a one-hour sermon I walked eight hours to get here don't give me feathers and no chicken over there because they sacrifice I want to be in church there was a family that had walked 8 or 10 hours a family that had walked locked I said what does it cost to get your little bus to be able to go back he said well about a in US Dollars might be a150 you know what I did I took out a couple bucks I said here take your family and take the bus home you know what the brother did he said thank you but we're going to walk I'll use it to feed my family because we haven't had much food my goodness mystery Babylon has taken America and America has now become a modern day Babylon the government is so perverted the people in leadership the Bible says that God has turned them over to a reprobate mind that they might believe a lie and be damned they will call evil good and good evil Darkness will cover and gross Darkness will cover the people but thank God for this evening light thank God this message my brother my sister I don't understand when people say I'm leaving the message you never had a revelation it was just church to you it was just church yeah I don't want church I want life Give me liberty or give me death Let's either get in or get out let's be serious about it yes if they persecuted you and they beat you like others even in Vietnam the nominal Christian Christians most of them have already suffered persecution we had we had ministers that we started ministering this message to in Vietnam many of them they half of their teeth are missing I could tell you of the atrocities that have happened to them put in forc labor camps just because they owned the Bible right do you know what they love God with a ferency when we were in Vietnam this was not open you couldn't have open air meeting no this was still communist controlled we came in in the early morning under darkness and we left under Darkness we came in on motorcycle brother Malcolm he he rode another motorcycle went a certain way I went and went this way and we came in under darkness and we were the only ones that went in and out for about four or five days everyone else that came to the meetings they all stayed right there they turn the music up real loud downstairs because we're having it on the second story so that it would mask us ministering they couldn't hear our voices because the music downstairs was blaring to the people because oh in a communist country you get rewarded if you turn somebody in so everybody's looking to turn somebody in and get money they had been persecuted so they knew what it was like to miss a meal their family's taken away from them the one brother he had his teeth all ing I said what happened he said the officer came up there and took the butt of his gun and took to his face and just busted all his teeth out because you own a Bible mystery Babylon here in America is trying to water down what we believe brother brenon preaches a sermon the invasion of the USA listen I want to confess right here before I go any further I'm an oldfashioned preacher and longing to see the old days again I've seen so much of this impersonation Hollywood glamorizing the gospel till I'm sick and tired of it yes sir I want to see the oldfashioned I'm afraid we're making Christianity too pretty for people it's a danger line you want to be a Christian come and die he who seeks to save his life will lose it but he who seeks to lose his life for my sake she'll gain it Christianity will not make you popular you'll not be Big Man on Campus you not be the most popular girl in school I remember carrying my Bible to school and one guy told me one time he says why you're so weak you have to carry your Bible to school you have to carry it you can't live without it I said no I can't and I think I said if you think I'm weak for carrying it you carry it I love Jesus Christ with all my heart and this message made my Bible real to me he went from three Gods to one God his name is Lord Jesus Christ and the prophet of God began to talk to us about Blasphemous names sir and church churches and harlots and all of this church system he said I'm not against the people right he said I'm against the system because it's Antichrist and this Antichrist system that's coming in America one day it's the word of God she's going to speak like a dragon and this hatred that you see is coming up what is it brother Bram said to the foolish virgin they're going to be martyred and he said the 144,000 martyred Moses and Elijah martyred it's dripping with blood it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood amen I hold this message dear to my heart I do and this sermon hear ye him Middletown Ohio the scripture was of no private interpretation it was wrote by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is the only one who can reveal it amen for it is hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and it's revealed to babes such as we learn so if you don't watch if you don't use the mind of the Holy Spirit to put it together you'll have your scene all mixed up for instance like a cow picking grass in the top of a tree that's just about the way some of it is looks now I remember you know when you go to search the message for certain quotes I searched for hours one time I know brother Bram said a cow on top of the tree eating grass he never said it he said picking grass you got to put in the right word I've never made that mistake have you ever seen a cow pick grass but that's just as Kentucky hillbilly you ever seen a cow on top of the tree picking grass so it depends on how have any of you ever researched certain quotes that you knew brother Braham said you go to and you can't find it and you search it this way and that way and finally when you find it oh just one word amen God help us to have the whole counsel of God now watch watch this Jesus said except a man be born of water and of the spirit he will no wise enter into the kingdom the picture looks ridiculous but the only way that we could find it is by revealing the Holy Spirit first in US receiving the holy spirit in us then he teaches us the truth and the life he will never disagree with the word he's always on the word so if the spirit now watch him now discern something so if the spirit in you says that the days of Miracles is passed it's not the Holy Spirit if you believe that Jesus is changed in the years that's gone by if that Spirits in you says that then it's not the Blessed Holy Spirit let me just throw some others out there if the spirit in you tells you it's okay for a woman to cut her hair it's not the Holy Spirit am God's holy spirit only vindicates his word the Bible says without Holiness no man shall see God now the Holiness we have is not something we put on but it's something that we receive you receive the revelation of Jesus Christ and sisters when you receive that revelation of Jesus Christ of Holiness to you do you know what you do you put on Holiness you put away immoral clothes now if it is a Creed or a dogma and that's all you've been taught then you're like a cookie cutter and for years you did what everybody else did but there come a time when you're going to go and say that's not me that's not for me so I don't want us to be just making people adhere to a certain yeah to conform to religion you young girls that are sitting right here I could come down and get in your face and I could say I'll tell you what don't you ever wear some memoral dress like this and I could scream and yell and get all mad and you know what it it might frighten you but is that going to hold you which one of you are going to be next walk away which one of your parents there ain't just nothing to it walk away from it do you know that we are in the most deceptive time this world has ever [Music] seen my heart breaks because many times the ministry is blamed for the people because they walk away well when they walked away from Jesus was it because his ministry wasn't good enough I want to ask you all of you that are Bible readers when did Jesus counsel newly married couples when did he take the young people and counsel the youth do you know what his counsel was the word of God that he preached so don't blame it on well we should have had a youth meeting we should should have had these and this and that and and blame it on our youth ministers yeah you guys ain't preaching hard James come on aren't you guys good enough sometimes as a pastor I do I see Lord I'm I'm not good enough I can't I can't preach it good enough why do people walk away why do people forsake it because it hurts me maybe it doesn't hurt you but it does me I say oh God I didn't dig around the tree good enough maybe we should have had more meetings maybe we should have Sunday morning Sunday evening Wednesday night Thursday night Friday morning you don't just go on and on no my brother my sister I want you to understand mystery Babylon is doing everything it can right now to take take away all that that we hold dear to our hearts in the sermon adoption I'm going to pass a few things here because it I'm I'm not done with this sermon I'm going to preach two or three sermons after this on mystery Babylon and the things that are happening because we have a Daniel we have a Babylon we have Hebrew children we have things happening that are all around us so listen when the pressure got on the three Hebrew children that was their day that's it you realize that when it does get bad that's your day sir it's your time to say I stand I stand amen having done all therefore to stand stand amen amen adoption 1960 we're reading in here where this Bible is of no private interpretation God forbid that I your servant or any other servant whatever try to put their own interpretation to the word let us just read it and believe it the way it's written and especially we Shepherds of the flocks we pastors who someday will gather Yonder in that glorious land with the little [Music] flocks and will stand in the presence of the Lord Jesus and we'll see the generation come up of Paul and of Peter and of Luke and of Mark and Matthew all of them and see them judged there with their groups you know what our little group evening Light Fellowship we're going to stand together as a little group I'm going to stand there with you I'm going to introduce you one by one evening Light Fellowship this is the one I've talked about this is him Lord Jesus evening Light Fellowship I will stand with every one of you let us stand together for the word of God Amen or do you want to of pastors compromising just give in anything everything's okay or one who will stand there with you and yes I'm not the greatest counselor I I admit that I don't text some of these that have been with me some of the longest Andy Menard John dubsky Robert McGary some of you that been how often do you get a text from me hey Robert how you doing buddy not often not often brother John very often Andy do we just called the chitchat I'm not that way I'm not this guy that I'm texting you all the time in fact I'm going to be quite honest with you that there are people in this church I don't know their first name I don't know their background they've come they've become a part of the church and the other day when we were in Texas and we had the we had the wedding back there and I sat down with a group of the Believers and we were sitting there and I said so God bless you where are you guys from they said from from Phoenix Phoenix yeah I said where do you go to your church really I was so embarrassed but not as embarrasses David McGary because he had a young girl come up and she was given a testimony or something 15 years old and David goes oh sis that was so good you know and talking to her after church and everything and says so so uh where are you from I'm I'm from here you are yeah you dedicated me I said I said yeah David you and I we we have a lot in common I would like to know all of you first name basis like to go to lunch with you like to know what food you like what do you do that makes you happy I'll tell you what saints of God the thing that makes me happy is the yeah I enjoy food I do but lot like spiritual food what really turns me on is to sit down and that's why I guess I enjoy the time on Monday mornings with the table of the Gods because we talk about the word of God and we get into it and there are times when they get so excited and men like brother Paul love all yes yes you better grab your coffee man brother Ron I'm telling you nothing but that TR the waitress going I was on the airplane coming back oh I was I'd been up in Greenville South Carolina and it's coming back on the airplane I used to play baseball I like baseball they offered me a

power hitter but I Little Bloopers here and there I loved baseball but baseball doesn't turn me on anymore I like the game I enjoy watching our guys run and hit the ball and everything I get so serious even with our guys playing that I don't hardly fellowship with the brothers is next to me I'm going hey hey you know I'll tell you another thing if I was your coach and you guys hit a Fly ball and they're going to catch it and you don't run to first base you sit the bench that's just how I am because that if that guy drops it sh yeah bench who'll call you Johnny Bench so I was on the

this a replay what going on right now oh so for three and a half hours on the airplane I watched the World Series Dodgers and whoever else it was and I got to watch this osani or whatever this guy Japanese guy he's a samurai huh that's how he holds [Music] it anyway I don't know why he said that yeah for three and a half hours I was glued to the and it was a comeback game too yeah you like those overtime games yeah I do I like the nail biters that's what this message is doing right now it's goal line this is it this is now or never we either run or we don't we either fight or we don't we either keep going or we don't I say to all of you and I there's so much more I could say Heavenly Father Here I am in another Babylon your Prophet said in so many places oh America here we are in Babylon once again we see all of the things around us Lord we see the pressures coming upon the people we see people giving up walking away and when they did Jesus said will you go also where could we go I ask you where are are you going to go to find something better than what we've got or if you want to go somewhere where it makes you feel good and you can live any kind of life this church is not for you it's not I would admit but if you're as serious as I am that you want to do all that you can to serve god with a ferency and with a passion not with lip service but with your whole heart oh God I pray that you will bless each and every one oh God here we stand in the midst of this modern day Babylon I do not look to Trump I do not look to our government I do not look to the inflation to get better prices to go down gas to go down and we have many years of plenty no it's going to get worse and because even the current President Biden is putting in current laws right now that is going to bring a taxation upon the people and things because he's going out and he's got to do it before he goes out of office so father regardless of all of this stuff regardless of who's in position position of President and Vice President that's immaterial because father we know that this America it's thus sayith the Lord she's Bound for judgment kabot is written over the it's written on the walls Lord and so father I pray help us Lord as your servants to to stand to do all that we can again father I thank you I praise you I ask that you'll be with us I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen
