uh thank you the musicians I think it might take a little bit longer so before we go into the word because I think some some things have to be said and been maybe able to introduced a little amen so I've I had to make little notes for this because I'm not very good in doing organized things so I might forget too much amen so I'm so glad to be here I'm so glad that the Lord just made a way and I was quite surprised when brother Ron found me uh or texted me some weeks ago and asked me to come and so uh I was quite surprised and I was happy to say yes to just uh to see one another back again after many many many years we go uh I don't know this I know I saw brother Amos and uh we know one another since many since uh yeah many years and also brother Matthew I don't know if he's here he's not okay and also sister Rebecca we remember how they were just uh I think uh 10 15 12 years old so we were just around at the farm and so the Lord was just gracious to us amen so there goes so many memories is there from back and that will not be the time now to speak about this but maybe tomorrow morning a little bit for the for the young people just something that's really on my heart uh What the Lord Has Done and also what he is doing I believe just this is what the Lord is doing right now amen and so I just bring the greetings I must be a little bit on my phone I bring the greetings from the church and uh in a northern part of Germany Wester timke it's a little bit difficult to pronounce whether it's just between Hamburg and Bremen and the northern part of Germany so we have a church there and I'm a pastor of the church there since many years since some years and uh um I'll try I have to introduce myself most of you have heard my name Andreas ringing Andrew ringing I'm married to my wife sister Claudia I think uh brother Ron and sister Sandy they know her and I'm married for four oh I don't know quite some years 30 some years we are married and we have 10 children by the grace of the Lord and they're they're all doing fine yeah for German is a little bit unusual I know that but I always say I'm not really a German in that sense so uh we are we are quite quite happy serving the lord amen and like I said it's going uh it's going quite back for many many years that we know uh brother Ron and sister Sandy the time that he was in Germany and uh so we uh we had some wonderful time and uh like brother Ron said uh I'm a mighty mighty move that got uh I believe he started and uh today by the grace of the Lord it is uh not less the the the Lord is still moving in a in a mighty way and so we're really grateful for that when the Lord starts something nobody can stop it amen amen if the Lord builds a house then we know what is going to to be and what is going to happen amen and so I'm I'm quite uh um quite just have to say a few things also that really um before we start going into the word that is really it was came on my heart why I was thinking of this anniversary meetings and that you have here and I came across a statement of the Prophet quite quite as astonished me uh I know you had the beginning here in uh or the starting 1992 brother fiscal dedication of the church building this was uh 30 years ago and uh uh brother biscal also a great man of God uh um a great Tool uh spreading the message of the hour amen and so uh and now 30 years later amen 30 years later uh it's another building I think uh uh and I believe that people are more molded and uh in the image of God Amen I believe that amen and it is not so much uh about the building that we are in because finally you are the building amen amen you are the house of God is that right amen and so we are not just talking of this flesh but the real you this is the house of God amen and so forth we are so glad to be there and I know in uh 30 years there is uh a lot of a lot of uh memories goes with that uh a lot of good memories and also sometimes not so good memories but finally we know that all things work together for good amen not all things are good but all things work together for good amen and so uh and I thought it was as I was just reading uh um it was God in simplicity was quite amazing I just came across and he and brother Adam preached uh God in Simplicity just about this just about 30 years ago he just was also in March 19 uh uh Now 60 years ago and sorry it was double Thirty so he preached it in March 1963 and he he's just said in that sermon uh there's really inspired me and I pray that the Lord may help us that we really understand and what great time we are in amen and he said there it is he also in 1963 they had also their 30th anniversary he said he they didn't make a big thing out of it but he said okay we are also 30 years together and they had a rededication of the building and I and then brother random actually preached the sermon got in simplicity amen and we understood what what came out from then it became at the opening of the seals game and uh a great time started for the Believers amen we believe that and I want to say another Ephesians began amen and I found it so appropriate really to understand uh that that we are here now you have your 30th anniversary and I really pray that the Lord will help us to really to understand what we are in where we are in and what time we are in and what God is doing and I just want to read the statement or a quote of that sermon God and simplicity which I felt was it's and that just felt it so wonderful also for today not only for this weekend but just in general what God is doing amen yeah it's it's quite a familiar quote brother random said he said now man has his own ideas of what God ought to be and what God is going to do and as I have made the old statement many times that man Still Remains man and I believe today is the same man is always giving God praise for what he did do and always looking forward of what he will do and ignoring what he is doing that's the way they miss it they look back and see what what a great thing he has done but they failed to see what a simple thing he used to do it with and then they look forward and see a great thing coming and it's going to happen and in nine times out of 10. it is already happening right around them and it is so simple that they don't know it Allelujah I I felt what a what appropriate thing that the prophet was saying amen and uh and I trust we just understand and believe the great thing that God is doing are you a part of the great work can we see that in our life Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah what a mighty God we serve amen and this is I I also really want this weekend as the Lord put something on my heart it has much to do with uh with the church with a building uh with uh with uh um it had a lot to do with this over the meetings that we will have and just my desire is that when we go out from here that it has become more real of what God is doing Hallelujah God bless you let us then to our feet and I just want to go to the scripture and uh we want to have a little um something on my heart this evening and I trust also I will be in time do you have a watch somewhere clock here okay there in the back okay we have to watch this amen we want to go to the Book of Joshua and then we want to go to the book uh Genesis we want to read from Joshua 5 2 and 3. and I want to speak this evening on having inventory in the Ephesians I just want to speak on having inventory in the Ephesians not foreign Ephesians but in the Ephesians amen when we go to from Joshua we want to chapter five we want to read two verses two and three we want to read Joshua 5 verses 2 and 3. at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel a second time is it okay Joshua five two and three and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins amen now this was this was across the Jordan they have crossed the Jordan into the Promised Land amen so in here he just had a circumcision we go there maybe a little later referring back to this and then we go to when we go to Genesis the third chapter Genesis 3 and I'm just excusing myself for my for my English but trust you understand it it's not my mother tongue so sometimes it's not very easy but I trust that you understand it and if you don't understand it pray for me okay Genesis 3 verse six I just want to read only one verse and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant for the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took off the fruit thereof and did it and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and just keep in mind it was three things that is going on here it was good for food Pleasant for the eye and the tree to be desired to make one wise it was three things that if was really confronted with amen let us pray together Heavenly Father we're just so grateful that we can spend this time together father and we pray that you will come just in a special way oh God take Thy word father and you're the only one that can reveal it lord it's not the minister that can reveal it it is only you father and we pray while we speak the word and uh the people receive your word father May the Holy Spirit just reveal the word to our hearts we pray father that it is more than just an information that it is more than just hearing it again father but that it will become a life living in our hearts we pray father and may these meetings uh be just something that it is Pleasant in your eyes father we commit ourselves into your hand in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you maybe see it amen so uh as we as we want to speak on on uh on uh on inventory in the Ephesians I just want to start with uh something rather Branham is saying in the message Jehovah Jireh one of the early messages brother Adam said you know he said uh and what we're looking at the Rapture is we are going to meet the coming Sun very soon we have to be changed and to be caught up he said but you can't be caught up the way you are now Ron said you are too heavy amen so I found it quite quite interesting he said we are too heavy so I don't think it's the body weight that he's speaking of I think I trust not so and I think that but I believe that he was just talking and looking to people to seeing what all is upon them what they all take to themselves and he said okay the way we are now you are now that's not the way we can go there's too many things that really uh are on us and brother I'm said also this way in another sermon brother random said this is a time really has for this journey we should not pack up what we could down pack we could we should really get things off of ourselves amen because if we are too loaded if we are too occupied there's nothing God can give us amen and so I believe this is the great thing that we we see today and I believe that uh um even brother random when he in the message Feast of the trumpets brother random said at the end of the sermon 1964 and brother random it's just praying and then brother random is praying he said he said Lord I pray that each and everyone may be in maybe in inside not outside but inside truly born again he said and we who are in I believe it's especially for those people we who are in lot may we take inventory now that we have seen and heard the voice of God speaking through his word and we know that the hour that we are living in amen maybe he's just praying help us to take inventory and I believe he was speaking not just only to uh people that had problems with things of the world and but he was he was really talking to believers amen he was really talking to to the to to a person that is born again like we could see in the Garden of Eden um which was which was happening to Eve and and really I want to go uh to that what was because Eve we understand is that we are coming back we are coming back to all that Adam and Eve lost or fell from we are coming back to that and we are not far away from that we are not far away from that church amen it's just what is what is needed for is just a body change amen it's just a body change we have further than we think we are third there and we add and there's two there's so many things you know sometimes it's for us very hard and I speak from experience it's very hard to receive things from God um because we have our preconceived ideas about things amen when we when sometimes even when you come across something brother random said uh you know it's it sometimes you have to be really free to receive it not something there from somewhere from some other Church of some other opinion just laying down there and when you hear or read something that you say oh no cannot be or it doesn't mean like this but I believe we we we are the best thing is that we can receive it the way it is spoken and the message is what the prophet really brought us we understand there is a message in the message we understand that amen there is a message in the message is that right that's that's a message that is written in the message amen and the elect will receive it if they are they will receive it and if they have an open heart it comes easily to them Allelujah if there's if there's release that's why to I believe it's so important that we are we are not we are not uh we are not when we speak of inventory it is also something which is not just only for for the newcomers uh but I believe that that inventory is for for young and old for each and everyone that is here you know for each of this is for the ministers this is for male and female for young and old for the laity he said it is for especially I believe when we speak of inventory it is for the Bride of Jesus Christ because she is too important to miss what God is doing amen she is too important to miss what God is doing because God wants to do it through her that's why we shouldn't miss it amen allow me to say you are the only chance that God has to leave the promise for to live the promise for this day out you're the only chance that God has amen amen and that's why I believe this this inventory like brother random said in another sermon brother Branham said always judge your life by how don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform miracles and we don't judge ourselves by the knowledge you have of the words but always judge yourself look back and take an inventory of what kind of fruit that the life you presently live now is bearing amen as I preach and you know and it's it doesn't really help if it is not a good fruit it does not really help to cut away the fruit because the fruit comes from somewhere amen so it's not really helpful just to cut maybe the fruit off and say okay this will solve because if something is wrong with the seed that fruit will always come back again so actually it is very important that we can that we really understand that that fruit that he is talking of comes from his seed amen and that seed had to be if there's a wrong seed that seed has to be be removed because if that ground is really possessed if that ground is possessed of a wrong or yeah of a wrong seed there is no place for the right seed amen so that's why I believe we really should look like the prophet will say so don't judge your life how much power you have to perform miracles amen and we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge we have of the words but always judge yourself look back and take inventory what kind of fruit your life is bearing what kind of fruit your life is bearing is it really the fruit that he wants to see on the tree is it really the fruit that God wants to see on the tree or is it the fruit that we want to see or somebody else wants to see amen that's why he gave his word and his word is a seed that's why he gave his word because his word will bring forth after its kind amen if his word falls into a good ground into your ground because you are the ground and if that word evolves into that ground it will bring forth after its kind and then you cannot help but but bear the fruit Hallelujah if there's a fruit if this what you bear is not the fruit for the season then there's something wrong with the seed amen so then it's time to take inventory and see what kind of seed somebody has sown what kind of seed is inside of there bringing forth that fruit amen so it's really time for I believe it's time for inventory because we understand as it was in the beginning in Genesis amen there was somebody putting the seed out amen there was somebody putting a seed out and and finally that seed was received and that seed brought forth Hallelujah that seed brought forth and Eve as a woman is the type of the church she brought forth she had she was the she was the vessel to bring forth Abel and she was the vessel to bring forth Cain Hallelujah so it depends what kind of seed is there that kind of fruit comes up so again if there's something wrong with the fruit I want to say if it is not the fruit for the season is very plain that that that we must have a fruit for this season amen not a fruit for another season which was wonderful but we need a fruit for this season it must be a word being sown in this season and if the word of God has been sown for this season in your heart it will bear the fruits if the right kind of atmosphere is created around the fruit will come up you cannot help because every seed will bring forth after its own kind Hallelujah and if God is sown into your heart what will come up Hallelujah I want to say it again if God is sown into your heart what will come up and we understand this message is nothing else than the word of God and if that word of God is sown into our hearts what do you expect to come up hallelujah what Eve received she brought forth is it right she brought forth Cain and she brought forth Abel that power is in the church and Abel was what a son of Adam which was a son of God so Abel was the son of God so that means Eve brought forth a Son of God we're speaking now the way of sexuality okay well this is the permissible we understand that amen so he should have come Abel should have come forth in a different way but because of the Fall it went that direction but look what the woman was look what she was she just brought forth what's been sown into her and then when it came up you see the fruit you saw Cain and he even said I received a son from the Lord and we understand what it was like brothers said all life comes from God so she even said that and how many people really understand where that seed comes from but you see his actions you see his life you know where his daddy was you know who is that he was and you saw Abel and you knew exactly who his daddy was both came forth via if Hallelujah so if it is not the fruit for the season that we are bearing we better watch and take care for the seeds and it's time for an inventory what kind of seed is being sown into our hearts this is what's because it's harvest time now Things become ripe things come up amen things come up and so so and if you if you really uh see if you if you see Cain and he's walking and he was a very religious guy we understand that he was a very religious man and it was not so quick to really understand who comes from whom you know what he liked to worship Ava Kane liked to worship then Abel like to worship but you are but you understood that what kind of sacrifice they brought a little bit identified who their daddy was Hallelujah and also was very striking the attitude they had many people are worried about the mark of the beast in our days you know and he was Cain was the first one who received that Mark is that right he was the first one he get it God gave it to him is it right God gave and many people today are afraid of the mark of the beast and they expected around the corner from whatever where it comes from but let me tell you you're born with it oh yeah if you're not truly born again you automatically have the mark of the beast because you're born with it this is the old nature is it right this is born in sin look how what you know why he did you know why he received that that uh that Mark actually but watch his I think really really clearly identified the mark of the beast you can see in the attitude he had amen when God told him something he had an attitude he had an attitude and that attitude came because he was a seed of the serpent that's why he had that attitude that was fruit that was coming up what kind of brother Adam said your attitude your attitude the attitude that you have that you're sitting here the attitude in what you are receiving the word the attitude if you can say Amen not to my word to what the prophet said the attitude you have represents you before the father Hallelujah if you can say Amen to everything then what said about you that represents you before the father because this only a true elective can say because he comes from God is that right and he is going back to God so what is he he's a part of God Hallelujah he's a part of God Hallelujah you were not only in God the prophet said you were not only in his thoughts he said you were his thoughts expressed in a Time ordained for you to come forth Hallelujah but if you see what what kind of what kind of fruit comes like brother random said don't identify or I say don't you say don't judge your life how much power you have to to perform miracles don't judge your life by that it's wonderful if we have power to do miracles but this is not the identification but see what kind of fruit your life is bearing what kind of fruits come forth is it really the fruit for the season is this the fruit for the hour is this the fruit of the message of the hour Hallelujah if not it's high time to take inventory and allow me to say to dig that seed up and to get it out of the ground amen amen because that seed every seed ribbing Falls after his own kind you are just a womb you're just a carrier you just someone that brings it forth Hallelujah this is what Eve was this is what the womb this is that this is the work of the woman that's why God made her that she should bring forth that through her life should come forth Hallelujah spoken word life and if we are back to all that Eve lost Hallelujah so it's only you through the life of Jesus Christ can come for us today laughs okay watch the church in laodicea as we just go a little bit along and in even 2000 years back we can see us as we understand as as 2000 years as it was with the birth of uh Christ and also the birth of the church finally and we understand that we are not living in the hour of the birth of the church we are living in the hour of the adoption of the church is that right in the birth of the church was at Pentecost amen but this is not just the birth of the church this is the adoption you know her brother said how every birth is like a mess it's a little bit like a confusion but he never said that about adoption he never said that about adoption so every church is really adopted and people just want to go back which is wonderful but we don't go back to our birth we now go we know we are coming to Perfection we're coming to adoption and this is where the church is coming to right that's why we don't expect confusion sorry to say so but the fruit of this word the fruit of this seed will not be a kind of confusion [Applause] man it's true so if it if it carries the if the fruit comes up of uh of now I don't want to say that because I don't want to confuse anyone you see but this is a different time Hallelujah this is not this is the this is really the result what happened at the upper room this is a final conclusion of it a son is being born to finally be adopted and brother Adam said the same father that gives them birth is the same father that puts him into place [Applause] is that right it is the same father that gives you the birth and that is a confusion that is a mess amen but that same father gives you adoption this is no mess anymore so what fruit is coming up in the church today what fruit are we bearing to just to make it clear are we bearing the fruit of the birth or are we bearing the fruit of adoption what are we expecting what are we expecting what are we expecting the Church of the Living God is going into now I believe God is tired I believe God is tired just to talk to little children he did it for so long he did it for so long he couldn't talk to the people like you wanted to talk to them because down to the church ages people did not fully understood their position they they came to his kind of adoption or you know the head there they had their adoptions every every you know every Church age had that time to come up but never to a place that is ordained now is that right and God in this our church God in this hour he he don't want to talk to children that don't really listen that they are so uh so caught up in emotions and in and move he he just want to talk to a bride now because what he wants to tell him now need to be received Hallelujah and you know somebody's really so excited he's not listening what you're saying he's so caught up but God wants to speak today and I believe he's doing it today you watch the Ministries you what what comes via this Pulpit you can see God is trying to give us something God is trying to tell us something and it must be received it must be received Church we are coming to maturity God waited so long two thousand years he waited he saw his church that was born in the upper room he saw that church dying not just only in nicaea but already the first church Edge brother and said was a fallen woman we don't have time to go in there tonight but it's already the first church age was deceived is it right when Paul when Paul came finally to the church it was already a fallen woman amen deceived like Eve and the deception was so good that even brother Branham thought it is the Holy Ghost he thought the white horse rider is that right but when the Lord told him he understood my goodness what is that for a deception and you know the deceiving part is always the White and the the white element that is a deceiving part and we understand we are living in a time where the Pale Horse is about or riding we're about to write and the deceiving thing in the Pale Horse is the white element black you understand red you understand but the white element makes him so deceptive this is how it was in the Beginning Church you know the first church the first church fell and when Paul and this amazing you God had a plan isn't that wonderful God has a plan he has everything under control and because he knew that he wanted to express further details of himself that's why he allowed the first church to fall that's why he allowed Eve to fall because his plan was to unveil more details of him to show more who he is Hallelujah that's why he made Man In His Image and he told them multiply and replenish the Earth but we understand when Paul came when Paul came to the church the church was already a fallen woman amen amen the Holy Ghost filled Church that was born at the day of Pentecost was a fallen woman amen when Paul came he saw straight away where the deception Lays if Paul would be in the upper room no deception amen amen but God planted like this he kept Paul back and Paul was later so frustrated he said I'm born out of season we understood if I would be there in the upper room this did not happen Paul understood that Hallelujah because he knew exactly straight from the beginning he would he could discern he could see he was it was like Adam if Adam wouldn't have been away from Eve but God just allowed him to be away from Eve so that this guy could come in and deceive her with the things that we have read in Genesis 3. and like I said keep those three things there with you because they will they will they they those are things that confront you in life every day and I'm so glad we had a prophet to tell us this because in this hour no deception possible you know why amen because we had a prophet amen we had a prophet and in this day he was even the first one Hallelujah so there's no deception possible can we can we say can I hear an amen when the prophet is there no deception Adam was a prophet if he would be around no deception he would plainly tell Eve don't receive it don't receive it stay free for me he would tell her don't receive it don't get occupy don't get defiled stay free for me because you are made for me you are my womb when finally when finally you know that debt that uh that the woman was when Adam identified her when Adam identified the woman at that time she did not had a name when he identified her their name was called Adam is it right amen so his name was her name amen and then he was she was taken out of man you know that that command that commission multiplying through replenish the Earth was given in the spirit form to be acted out to be acted out in dust form Hallelujah amen so we understand or we we slowly start understanding what God has in his mind what Redemption means we sing that song Redemption by Blood do you believe that he died for you do you believe he paid the price for what for all is it right when he said it's finished and he paid the price he said it's finished salvation was complete so he paid the price for all that Adam and Eve lost Hallelujah that's what Seven Angels Came to declare that's why this message is different that's why there's a change in the ministry of William Brennan that's why the messenger the prophet of this age is not just William Branham but the Holy Ghost himself [Applause] Hallelujah amen we might go there on Sunday a little bit and and I was so amazed to see things which I always believed and always read how real they are that's my seventh angel came to declare Hallelujah that's that's that this is actually the change in the like brother Adam said you will see a change in my Ministry this is what we call the son of man Ministry is it right not only the church H messenger but the son of man revealed again this is the hour that we're living in and that revealing of the son of man did not end it with William Branham that Ministry is still going on and we see even a greater revealing and failing of God in this hour if we have open eyes Hallelujah if there's not a seed in US blocking that something is being sown by the way in our walk in our daily walk in our lives something that we just picked up Satan is busy trying to throw everything at you everything and I speak of truly born-again believers so it's not just throwing things of the world against you but he's throwing good things at you very good things at you because what he was throwing to Eve hey it was very good is it right yeah so you never just said to you come on have let's have sex with one another no no he just presented it differently amen so that finally she said oh that's good and she took from the fruit amen it was her allowing him to come into her Allelujah he's coming today in such I don't want to make I don't want to anybody to be afraid but just be aware we should not be afraid of the enemy but we should be aware of him brother I'm said to overcome and to overcome I will sit with him in his strong to overcome means that you that you understand every trick of the enemy is that right and here came Paul and he saw the trick of the enemy saw it straight away that's why he could really correct Peter he could tell him hey what are you doing what are you trying to get results what are you trying to force out of the people right he could tell that because he saw this sorry when I say that he saw this is the Antichrist spirit amen working through Peter yeah sure amen to Holy to a holy ghost filled vessel Yeshua when Paul came to the church to that great church of Pentecost he said brother Branham said that group or that church was already a fallen a defiled woman you mean the Holy Ghost filled people they were defiled yes so not to be afraid of nothing but just to be aware just let us raise the level of awareness that we understand how the enemy is trying to come around the corner especially to Born Again Believers in this message he knows he's not getting you with any kind of else than with quotes that's why he came to Jesus with it is written right he knew exactly he couldn't cut he couldn't he shouldn't come in any other way so he came to him it is written Jesus said I know it is written but it is also written you know why he could not be deceived because he was the word and you know why you cannot be deceived because you are the word [Applause] that's why you cannot be deceived why I need a prophet to tell you that you need a prophet to tell you that Hallelujah that's why you need a prophet if needed Adam to tell her um Hallelujah because you are predestinated in this hour not to be deceived that's why God sent a message a messenger to tell you that who you are and if you understand you are a part of God can God be deceived how in the world you Hallelujah well the message we have received judge oh it's time for an inventory it's time for an inventory to see what is coming up inside of me what is start growing what is becoming fruit is it really the fruit of the season is it really a fruit of maturity Hallelujah and if not have the courage to set out to Satan it is also written I hope I can speak like this but I know you are you are you know I know brother on so I know what he believes I know that you also believing it is that right amen so you understand so the Deception comes by the word Hallelujah not by the message of the hour but by the word and Satan is clever he is clever like he was with Eve like he was with a woman Oh my he knew exactly where to go to yeah he didn't he did not he wouldn't go to Adam he wouldn't and he wouldn't go to ease the time when she was still in Adam but he came to her when she was taken out of him he came to her when she was identified when there was an Adam telling her you are bone of my bone you are flesh of My Flesh now this doesn't speak of humanity you are Flesh of My Flesh you are me and what was her name what did he call her he called her a position amen he said I you are the woman with other words you are the womb of the man Adam God had taken the womb out of Adam and you know that womb for what it is there I can do I can stand on my head I cannot produce children or bring false children I can do whatever I want well the children are inside of me I Got Talented they were all inside of me but I had no chance to bring them forth unless I find my womb and brother said if you find the girl if you find a man that you love you don't know why amen you don't know why he said you find someone is only one not two no three is only one Adam had no choice she was the only one [Applause] well it's very simple God didn't make two and said you choose he just said this is what it is and this is also how it is with us Hallelujah amen and you know I can how how much ever children are inside of me that's wonderful and they're in me crying for expression Hallelujah and the only way to let them come forth is to my womb and this is how you fall in love with someone has nothing to do so much with sexuality but I'm said listen he said when you when you meet a woman and the woman meets a man and you love one another and you don't know really why you found the right one he said you are mates for eternity did he say that amen he said you are mates for eternity Hallelujah amen because just to show that the womb belongs to the man the womb is actually the man in another form and this is what the woman was that's why Adam had no choice Adam laughed laughed if so much his love was elective amen is it right his love must have been effective don't bring too much humanism inside of it his love was elective because he understand without her I can do nothing Hallelujah he understood that and Church Without You [Applause] Christ can do nothing that's why he died for you that's why he died for you because he needs you Hallelujah there she was at Calvary how roll around him tried to show it that Calvary she came at like Adam was put into sleep Oh Glory like Adam was put into sleep yeah and it was put into sleep said Adam you have nothing to do with this this is my work God said this is my work because I have a plan Adam did not have to plan God had to plan [Applause] allow me to say I hope you understand that Christ don't have the plan God has the plan and he transferred the plan into Christ and this plan is transferred into the church now she understands she knows what it is and the prophet said when she knows what it is the rapture will go she understands her position [Applause] oh my it's time for inventory like inventory not just don't drink don't smoke if you still do that you must be born again but now we are speaking of adoption Church now we are coming to to the reel to the fall to the real birth let me say that to birth brother random said a new birth according to Malachi 4. did he say that not a new birth according to what the head in the church ages but he knew birth according to Malachi 4. Hallelujah and this is this is what the church is who he was and then when Adam excuse me I just must must try to to Really follow the track otherwise really we will be here tomorrow now I trust we have three services we can a little bit but it's always like this when you start something it's very difficult to stop amen because because you just see what God is doing and I personally I'm just trusting I absolutely I'm depending on the leadership of the Lord absolutely I have my thoughts I have my ideas but I said Lord whatsoever that is because I know bright material is sitting here I know that I just know that and I believe you can believe that if that's if you don't believe that you are the one that something is wrong with your faith don't hope don't guess God wants you to be sure because this is the hour where he wants to treat that woman like an adult woman like a mature lady he wants to talk to us through the blood of Jesus Christ for sure so he wants you to stay under the blood because until you understand under the it is finished everything that every Redemptive blessing was paid for glorious and he wants you to stand under the blood because if you're under the blood he can talk to you amen he's tired of not being able to talk to his wife to the church he died for he wants to talk to her he wants to have fellowship with her like God had fellowship with Adam and Eve in the beginning judge we are back I believe we are back what is just missing is the body change but we are back the price was paid for this Hallelujah the price was paid for this that we come to the time that we realize he's talking about us he's talking about me Hallelujah amen so he just you know this is actually where if we come but if we come to that maybe this evening we will see but you see how how many times things that Satan has thrown at us in our life occupies us look at the woman at the well was she a predestinated seat she was Jesus came to her waiting for her and the Bible said he had to go to a certain City there was a precinated seat there so he went there and when he found her he could do nothing for her first he had to have an inventory talk with her life the enemy circumstances has thrown so many things at her so he said woman give me a drink he wasn't he couldn't come out straight even if he knew and I believe he knew from the beginning who that was but he couldn't talk to her like this Hallelujah but I believe in his heart he had a desire to tell her this is who you are Hallelujah you believe God has a desire to tell you who you are he's tired of playing hide and seek one day you were in one day you're out he's tired of that he said hey I died for you so he came here he came to the woman at the well and he saw a city he came to you say hey that he knew he went he said woman give me a drink oh she said you know uh we are we are Samaritans you know and we have no no customs of you know sharing it together we should with your you know where you come from you know why she was so occupied she was so full of it that he first had to really remove things so it was an inventory talk he talked with her so while he was going on you know he understood really where things were laid and what so finally he said you know he he she came to quite a bit after a while she understood and she recognized okay this guy is not a Jew he's not a Jew oh you must be one of the prophets and this is where many message believers stop they just knows God sent a prophet amen but he didn't came to her that she to recognize make her recognize that he was a prophet recognizing him as a prophet did not deliver her totally recognizing he was a prophet did not brought her to her position Hallelujah only when she saw this is a messiah she came to herself you know why because she was a part of him that gave her the power to live the right kind of life not just she understood God sent a prophet God did not send us the prophet to me the Messiah came not William Branham for sure not but Jesus Christ I can see the Messiah is here right how do I know that because I am a part of that [Applause] if you do you believe that word is Eagle food then according to brother random you have heard from your tophany is that correct you have a body waiting you are a part of God because that body is a part of God is that right that body is a thought of God that body is a part of God that Waits For You shows you that you are a part of him make you recognize that word to be Eagle food and when you realize that word is Eagle food you leave all other things behind you because you have found Who You Are and when an eagle understands not just its mama but when an eagle understands that's me when the eagle understands not against mama and papa flying there when the the little legal understands hey they can do it if they can do it and mama said yes because I can do it you can do it also this is when we understand and realize what God really what this message came for church but you see so many things have uh by by the time and and by time and Satan is so clever especially with these modern media Church we see Smart in he's bombarding you 24 7. he's just bombarding you with all kinds of nonsense yes I must say it with all kinds of good religious nonsense my goodness what came up what came up even through during this covet season what kind of ideas came up I taught a church at home forget about most of it is denomination and nonsense just that simple because you never hear the prophet speak about it but Dr Solomon though said something on YouTube or or Mr so-and-so or or whatever send some news about uh YouTube and people receive it and make an issue out of it in the church I always tell the church I said if you make an issue out of something have to profit for it please have the prophet for it the mark of the beast truly is not in that sense you know what we can count together 666. you can find that in denomination amen he but he was the prophet oh you know what he made for a statement he spoke about the foolish virgin that's brother Branham now he said the foolish virgin had the mark of the beast you know why because of her attitude and what she did to the wise virgin you know when Cain poof my goodness Locane God told him something and he said am I My Brother's Keeper what is a fun attitude God's speaking to you oh my God was even telling him God giving him the chance do like your brother right is it right he said to Cain do like and brother random said he even put the lamb before Cain's door and said to him do like your brother and Cain said no he couldn't say yes because there was nothing in him to say yes that's why he got a mark that Mark was be careful or feel sorry he's just a beast not you for sure okay is that right so he get the email Mark for protection is that right and just to let the people know and don't use it for reproduction hmm amen and then the Bible said after all this and Cain went away from the Lord he went away from the Lord it never was spoken about Abel Abel never went away from the Lord he couldn't because he was the son of God but Cain you understand and brother Adam said about the foolish virgin you see her attitude see her attitude when they woke up and you know asleep I was woke up and one had enough oil and the other one not the first thing that the foolish virgin said give us of your oil what is selfish attitude is that right oh church let us let us really be aware and awake and then the wife said you go and buy yourself and they left the presence of the wise virgin like Cain left the presence of God if that woman that foolish woman she was really foolish why would she not stay with the wife amen why she wouldn't stay with the wise why she could not humble themself amen so we see today what kind of attitude do we remember in the days go back in the days Old Testament he was the Ruth and now Naomi Ruth and offer and there came a day when when you know really life went wrong and things had messed up both of them Ruth and Alpha had similar same problems husband died there was a really an effects and now they was on the on the walk with Naomi back and suddenly Naomi said you know that makes no sense what you're doing here I cannot have children and boys that you can marry later which was the law in that time which that you marry and so just please go back go back to where you come from Mary get get another man be happy and both of them said no no no no and then after a while really you know we said no no no really be honest with one another surely told truth she said Ruth please go back if you love me go back and Ruth that don't talk to me like this offer accept it amen Ruth couldn't accept she said but you understand how God is proving who you are oh we have we have to understand today God in the way how he is doing things this was just proving who she was said she was a predestinated seat a part that belongs into the lineage of Jesus Christ that's why you find her in Matthew 1. that's why you find her there you know why because she wasn't part of him identified in God's own special way God is not treating us as little babies anymore Church he believes who you are he knows who you are that's why he can allow difficult things come upon you that's why he can allow even sickness to come upon you he can allow all kinds of things to come upon you because he knows who you are and now he's proving to Satan you can do with them whatever you want they cannot say no [Applause] you know one day there was there was Scott and Satan Satan came before God in his head and God said hey satan where did he come from yeah from going around the world you know looking up and down and and then God said by the way have you considered my servant job it was not Satan putting the attention on job it was God to make Satan attentive of job you know why because God knows who he is and God wants to prove who he is and he has his own way of proving who he is and we have to understand as a mature church we have to understand him today in his ways Church the Bible tells us and one of the Psalms that God is complaining and he said Moses knows me in my ways but Israel just knows me in my Act and God said I'm tired of it they just know me in my Act when they see an act of me he's here he said he said we follow you if they don't see an act do you come to church because you see signs and wonders do you just come to church because oh there's a move of God or you come to church because you are the move of God this is what the judge must be not just coming to a move but becoming the move Hallelujah and God you can read it and God was finally with Israel so tired he said 40 years 40 years I have shown signs and wonders I have did everything and still they don't know me they're just happy to see a miracle ah God is there God is there God said I'm tired of it I'm tired of it I'm just tired of it but Moses he knows me in my ways to him I can talk like a friend oh I can talk to him like somebody that has grown up to him I can say Moses you did a mistake to him I can say Moses I'm sorry you don't go in the land is that right and Moses didn't melt is that right he didn't melt down and said oh no he had to accept David a man after God's Own Heart you know why he was after God's Own Heart he was a man not because of his mistakes but because what he did after the mistakes he could repent like no one could repent but then after repentance was over he stood up and he said time of repentance is over now time of being child and uh weeping and it's over now is that right that's why he was a man after God's Own Heart because he always could come up and God could talk to him again but here was here was about here it was about job and and you know how God was getting the attraction on him that have you seen my servant there's no one like him ah the Satan said yeah it's very easy you have kept him you have blessed him you know God said okay go ahead take it away from him he's good so Satan took everything away you know how it was okay you know everything went off of him and then finally they met again God and said they met again and so God and Satan said again hey if you considered him there's no one like him you know there's no one like him yeah he said okay you know A man gives you know of everything let me give but then God said you can do everything but his life you don't touch Hallelujah his life you don't touch oh let's say let me say his life you cannot touch and then Satan must have said you know why why are you so sure about job and God has said I don't tell you this this I only tell him after a while and then after a while job understand even if the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I will see him you know I will see him because I'm a part of him this Revelation came to job and this came to job and God had his own way to prove him do you know that brother Branham actually said not one disaster job went through was for chastisement not one all of them was for proving Hallelujah amen just to prove who he was and God in this hour came down to proof now who his pride is and he has his only his own way of proving her don't judge your life how much power you have to perform miracles Hallelujah what a great time we're living in church amen what a great time you're living in but here the woman let me let me finish at least the woman at the well okay then we can maybe come tomorrow we go a little bit deeper we will see how the Lord really allows because we want to go back to Eve finally we want to see really where where Eve was going what Eve was what he wasn't you know that when he came to Eve she was in her Ephesians yes she was placed she was placed because Adam had told her you are bone of my bone you are Flesh of My Flesh you are me another form she was positionally placed amen and in her if he if Satan came to her knowing knowing what ability lays in her that's why Satan comes to you he knows what church you go to yeah he knows what you hear in this church that's why he's attracted to you because potentially he knows you have bright material amen so you understand so that's why he came to her that's why you you are under full attack of him because he knows what kind of abilities you have maybe you don't know yourself Eve didn't know herself because she was not identifying herself it was Adam identifying her so this is not what you say about this is what the word says about you this is not what you can say about it it's not to say I'm bright I'm bright I'm bright but when he said that we should believe it is that right if he said that amen we should believe it what kind of potential it's Leonard foreign because really I'm I don't want to I don't want to mess up the first evening already I have in Europe the having Europe the uh and not a good reputation I've always been so long so I I said to Lord I I don't want to mess up my reputation just in the first meeting but you understand he was Eve he was the woman what kind of potential lay in her this kind of potentials lays in you can we believe that it's not my words it's not my words but I'm just telling you what the prophet said amen so who are you are you Miss Jesus Christ is this Who You Are you married to him who is married to him this evening not to William Branham not to your pastor not to this church to Jesus Christ and if you're married to Jesus Christ who are you yes amen because he came down to marry his womb in this day not William Branham came down Jesus Christ came down Revelation 10 1 was not William Branham Revelation 10 1 was Jesus Christ he came down this was seven angel stand for is that right that's why Seven Ages stand for for he himself coming down because you see the seven angels forming a cloud who is that Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ came down he said right Jesus Christ came down Revelation 10 1 came down in that time Revelation 10 7 was on Earth said that at the time of that coming the seventh angel Messenger will be on earth sir so is he just coming for to him you know he's coming to him for a reason Revelation 10 a marriage take place you can read it in the in the message the breach it's very amazing you read the message you preach Anew it's it's amazing page 88 in the English if I have it right in the book brother Adam is speaking of the Angels coming down Christ coming down and then brother banham said this he said oh he said am I feeling like this just feeling like this you know what you do in a marriage you ask the question is there anyone here that has something to say against it this is what brother Venom is doing in that sermon and then brother said if not then forever hold your peace read the reach message he's doing it exactly in the sermon just performing a marriage the question is what do you say about it he said already yes he came down and he said already yes that's my life what do you say about it what is your answer he asked you will you marry me that coming down he came for one reason yes not just to play games just to marry his bride the prophet said the marriage takes place on Earth then we go to the marriage supper is that correct this is what we have seen in our day Christ coming down Revelation 10 one came to Revelation Revelation 10 7. to get married to Revelation 10 8 to 11. oh my and this is changing for the bright Church it was changing for John you know why it was the same John that before was not even Worthy to look at the book not even Worthy is that right no one was worthy go to Revelation 4 and 5. no one that's why he wept no one was worthy to take the book but something very amazing happened in Revelation 10. he is asked or he's commanded take the book eat the book become pregnant with the book because you are the book become pregnant with the book because now you will bring forth Thou shalt prophesy again and church allow me to say this is what's going on right now the bride is prophesying again [Applause] God's final voice wonderful you clap not to me because this is what he said hey Hallelujah you could clap to a minister because he's saying what the prophet said he's saying what the word said many times people clear because of emotions that's wonderful okay that's not too bad but better is when you really clap because of the word [Applause] Hallelujah amen isn't it isn't it amazing come on Church the one that was crying and weeping and one came and said John weep not we've not because the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and when he turned around what did he saw he saw a lamb as it was saying Jesus Christ he paid the price Church he paid the price Hallelujah paid the price for full Redemption and now now we can imagine John who was just he said no one was worthy so he must have seen there was not even allowed not even to look at the book not to touch it not to look at it not even to look at it it's amazing isn't it oh God help us and now the angel tells him go to the angel take the book John said me in Revelations 4 I was not worthy to look at it and I can remember how I cried and I know that one of the one came to me and said to me don't cry John don't weep Hallelujah Hallelujah don't weep John because the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed the price is paid and what it's change what is the change now John is him now because you know what happens at the marriage or we could go we could go for a long there's a big the Bible speaks of Enoch Bobby speaks of Enoch you know Enoch the seventh from Adam a type of this church is that right is that right Enoch and not much is written about Enoch so we don't know what he really did or what he has all done and we don't so a good thing is we cannot copy so it's not much written how much he prayed and you know what he did to please God but he had the testimony before his translation that he pleased lot and without faith it is impossible to please God you must believe what he said about you [Music] sure and the seventh from Adam is that right the seventh from Adam Enoch before his translation church he had that testimony that he pleased God and this church will have before their translation they will have the same testimony that day please and you know what pleasing God means adoption yes what about Israel most of them God was not well pleased you know why he never could bring them to adoption they always stayed like little children they saw a miracle praise God the Miracles over oh God yeah come on this is what they were and after 40 years God get tired and after 60 years amen after 60 years now Hallelujah after 60 years he's now on the scene he came down Church and now he wants to have a bride if you marry if as my wife married me I remember and I remember it's too long ago but I I think in the wedding night remember in the wedding night you know you married your wife and also in future what do you do with your wife always your husband who is your wife if she only you come into the house and you want to be received as the husband or you know as the one that loves you and and she's just sitting in the corner enjoying the gift that you gave her just enjoying the gift you know my what a wonderful gift my husband has given me and you know he can maybe stand it for a couple of days but when it comes to reproduction when it comes to giving life it's not enough to play with gifts that you have from him but when it comes to life you need him you need Revelation 10 1 in this hour to bring forth the same kind of life don't play with gifts The Giver of gifts is here Hallelujah amen why are we close why are we close we have to come to a close amen but this is what Eve was the woman let me read to you one statement of the prophet oh no I keep it till tomorrow it's too wonderful to see what God is doing Hallelujah that will go into the subject of Tomorrow of what true worship is what true worship is God was Jesus was sitting with a woman at the well and he was telling her the father seeks worship is that right God is looking for worship not just for singer not just for musicians which is wonderful don't misunderstand me wrong but worship to God is different that worship Him in spirit and in truth he was telling that woman in that condition you cannot worship but when he I I you know when he inventoried her then she could worship is that right then she could worship you know what she did she ran into the city she brought people to Christ it was now Christ working through her and she said when the Messiah cometh he will do those things he just had to say honey it's me and she understood oh that's him then I am his bride and she ran into the city Hallelujah you see what changes your life if you know who he is then you know who you are if you can identify him you will identify yourself last quote of of God's provided place of worship listen very careful the result of no leaven among you no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you if there's no leaven no leaven no leaven of the Pharisees be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees Jesus was warning you know what 11 is foreign the message of the former age is that okay can I say that yeah I'm just telling you what the prophet said he said if there's no leaven among you just pure word of this day listen what it brings it brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you can you believe that the entire fullness of the godhead now bodily bodily hello who is that you are the entire fullness of the godhead because all that God was he poured into and we had a prophet telling us and all that Christ was is now so that all that God was is now in the church and no leaven amongst us brings the entire fullness couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in versus age couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man has been manifested brought the church back together with the entire deity of God amongst his people isn't it wonderful Hallelujah that's why it's good to have inventory God bless you let us down to our feet yes just tell them that you love him what he has done for us in this what he has done for us in this day hallelujah what he has done for us Church he came down himself Hallelujah and he is here do you believe that this evening brother random left the scene but he didn't lift he didn't lift he stayed because he came for his bride not just to find her not just to find her you know and not just to play with her no to make herself ready amen and the bride has made it now he gave her the fine linen which is his righteousness is that right that's why John could be told eat the book John because he was there closed in his righteousness let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and mercy father we thank you for what you have done it sounds sometimes too good to be truth but I'm so glad that it was your Prophet telling us this these things it's not an idol Idol Tale there they came back that morning from the grave [Music] those sisters came back and brought a message from he is not dead anymore he's risen he's alive we have seen him form Mary has said you know what I thought it was the gardener but it was him [Music] and this disciples said no no no no no we cannot believe this but it was the truth it was Jesus Christ here came the one the two on the way of Emma was telling them look look he's alive we saw him and we thought it's a stranger [Music] but it

many like Paul so many characters of The Bible after you have met Paul there on the road to Damascus he was so full of everything then you let him down to Arabia to get free completely and then you could bring him up there where he saw his theophany father we pray that each and one each and everyone here this evening can get so delivered so free from everything that you can bring us to ourselves like the prodigal as he there was a time when he could come to himself [Music] when he could not even get swine food anymore [Music] and he was hungry he was hungry he couldn't get anything then the angel could talk to him and could tell that boy boy wake up come to yourself you're a son of God then he could say my father has father may that be this evening to to someone oh God that we can inventory Our Lives that we can see how much things Satan has thrown at us don't let you work don't let your job don't let your church don't let father and mother husband or wife get that away from
