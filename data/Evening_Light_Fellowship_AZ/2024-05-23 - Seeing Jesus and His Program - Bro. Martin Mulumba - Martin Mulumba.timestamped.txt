[31:33] musicians uh we'll take our Bibles once
[31:36] again in the book of first king chapter
[31:45] 19 1 King 19:
[31:48] [Music]
[31:55] 13-8 and it was so when Elijah heard it
[31:59] that he wrapped his face in the man in
[32:01] his mantle and went out and stood in the
[32:04] entering of the cave and behold there
[32:07] came a voice unto him and he and said
[32:10] what Dost thou hear Elijah and he said I
[32:14] have been very jealous for for the Lord
[32:17] God of hosts because the children of
[32:20] Israel have forsaken thy Covenant thrown
[32:23] down thine altars and slain thy prophets
[32:27] with the soul and I even I alone am
[32:30] left and they seek my life my life to
[32:34] take to take it away and the Lord said
[32:37] unto him go return on thy way to the
[32:42] Wilderness of Damascus and when thou
[32:45] comest unto azahel to be and comest
[32:48] anoint azahel to be king over Syria and
[32:52] jeru the son of Nishi shall thou anoint
[32:55] to be king over Israel and Elisha the
[33:00] son of shapat of of
[33:05] ABA shall thou anoint to be prophet in
[33:08] thy room and it shall come to
[33:12] pass that him that escape the sword of
[33:15] Isel shall Jo slay and him that escape
[33:19] from The Sword of joil shall Elisha slay
[33:23] yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel all
[33:28] all the knees which have not bowed unto
[33:31] Bell and every mouth mouth shall have
[33:35] not kissed him may the Lord bless the
[33:38] reading of his word you may be
[33:41] seated uh once again uh I greet you all
[33:45] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[33:47] Christ is uh a privilege once again to
[33:50] be in the house of the Lord as uh we
[33:54] are going through uh this uh series
[33:58] of seeing Jesus and his
[34:00] program uh Jesus giving his program to
[34:04] his Prophet Elisha
[34:06] Elijah uh to be able to go and anoint
[34:10] three people for the Fulfillment of his
[34:12] ministry and right afterward we see that
[34:16] uh despite the prophet not
[34:19] knowing uh complaining before the Lord
[34:22] that he was left himself in Israel that
[34:25] everybody has bowed down
[34:28] uh before Bal but he said no I have
[34:31] 7,000 people that um have not bowed down
[34:36] to to Bal uh we see in the message the
[34:40] prophet also uh complaining in the same
[34:43] manner he said uh if there be eight
[34:45] people to be saved in this
[34:48] generation uh it will be a very uh
[34:52] astonishing thing to find but in they
[34:54] said by the grace of God uh later on in
[34:57] the journey Journey the Lord was able to
[34:59] show him uh the bride coming out in the
[35:02] vision though he did he only saw that in
[35:05] the vision but by God's grace in this
[35:07] last day uh the bride day after day is
[35:11] coming out of the rubbish and and all
[35:13] the dirt of the World by his grace uh in
[35:17] this great program that God was has
[35:20] given to his prophet he had shown him uh
[35:24] the condition uh that he will found
[35:27] himself in after running away from
[35:30] Jezebel that's what we had tried to
[35:32] start last uh time he were uh here
[35:36] seeing Jesus and his program and why
[35:38] communism that we see that the prophet
[35:42] had uh three set of people that he had
[35:44] to anoint and we find that according to
[35:47] the word that uh you may have uh one um
[35:52] person that hides many things behind him
[35:55] or one scripture that uh folds many
[35:59] elements behind because in the word we
[36:02] understand that anything any
[36:04] Scripture uh has a two-fold or compound
[36:08] uh M mystery behind it uh every single
[36:12] thing every single verse sentence or
[36:15] chapter can reveal the entire program of
[36:18] God um many times as uh brother bam says
[36:21] it that you read the Bible and if you
[36:23] don't see Jesus go back and read it
[36:26] again because Jesus hiding himself in
[36:29] very many types and shadows of being a
[36:33] thief coming as a thief in the middle of
[36:35] the night as we know that a tee is not
[36:38] very a good example to be presented by
[36:41] somebody but Jesus can can come and hide
[36:43] himself behind uh such uh types and
[36:47] shadows in the same manner also the very
[36:50] program the very things that the prophet
[36:52] has given us in the message can uh
[36:56] sometimes hide the some of the things
[36:58] that many people can say oh I can't
[37:01] preach on this because this can be a
[37:04] stumbling block to many people but by
[37:06] God's grace when the Holy Spirit comes
[37:08] and picks up those element it just opens
[37:11] up even more than by the time we realize
[37:14] say like you know oh it's not by might
[37:17] it's not by by strength it's not uh
[37:21] because we went to school but it's
[37:23] because it is his grace and when his
[37:26] grace comes and opens up those things
[37:29] you know you can't hide it you can't
[37:31] hold it for yourself you have to share
[37:33] it about because when uh John uh saw
[37:38] that nobody was able to look upon those
[37:40] things because uh these were tremendous
[37:43] things so nobody could look nobody could
[37:46] even understand what this great mystery
[37:49] was but then when the book was open then
[37:52] all of a sudden all the nature Heaven
[37:55] and Earth heard shout because there was
[37:59] a new song because the things that we
[38:02] used to be uh a stumbling block or
[38:06] something of uh of great shame of uh uh
[38:10] of a great uh discussion in the church
[38:14] that you know you can't speak this
[38:16] because uh nobody knows what it is
[38:19] sometimes if we had to speak about it it
[38:22] can
[38:23] be can uh uh give people very in amount
[38:28] of shock people have stayed away from
[38:31] churches left to churches
[38:33] because certain things were spoken
[38:36] about but by God's grace when the Holy
[38:40] Spirit comes down it gives us a whole
[38:42] different perspective of those things
[38:45] and then when we start looking at it say
[38:47] oh we can speak about
[38:49] this because these are our
[38:52] inheritance because this is our program
[38:56] because God has G given us these things
[38:59] because at
[39:01] yesterday it was a stumbling block you
[39:05] speak about it why do you say did you
[39:08] say that oh this pastor is racist or
[39:11] this brother doesn't like us oh this
[39:14] church is uh this way I can't believe
[39:17] that we are in 2024 and people are still
[39:19] thinking this way no it's not
[39:23] understanding it's not human
[39:25] ability amen but it is God coming down
[39:30] and when it comes down it truly comes
[39:32] down and when he opens it up we start
[39:36] looking at reality we say oh Lord if it
[39:40] wasn't for the blood if the blood wasn't
[39:43] shed we would never known these things
[39:46] because when the blood was shed then we
[39:49] have the boldness we have the courage to
[39:53] go into the holy of holies because in
[39:56] the holy of holies that's where the two
[39:59] cherubin male and female had the face
[40:02] looking upon the mercy seat and in The
[40:04] Mercy Seat that's where all the TBL of
[40:07] the law with laid within and nobody was
[40:11] able to go into the holy of holies
[40:14] unless he had seen the shed of the blood
[40:18] and today we have people who want to
[40:20] come into the holy of holy wants to
[40:22] understand explain it to me let me
[40:26] understand it no it's it's not because
[40:28] when we we explain it that you'll be
[40:30] able to see it but the way the provided
[40:33] way is through the blood and under the
[40:37] blood the shedding of the blood you
[40:39] renounce of yourself your knowledge your
[40:42] understanding all that we thought that
[40:44] we were just as we saw it uh in the last
[40:48] series all that that I am from this
[40:50] background I am from this this year all
[40:53] that didn't matter until you come under
[40:56] the blood
[40:58] because the blood tells you you need to
[41:00] leave everything that is of you and to
[41:03] take everything that is me and by taking
[41:06] everything that is him then it gives us
[41:09] a whole different perspective of life
[41:12] that's right that's
[41:14] why our precious Prophet Elijah found
[41:18] himself and said Lord I am here all
[41:21] alone everybody has forsaken the Lord
[41:24] they've thrown down thy altars there's
[41:27] no message anymore everybody is going
[41:29] left and right giving their own
[41:31] interpretation the Lord said
[41:33] no that's your
[41:36] perspective that's your way the
[41:38] humanistic way of looking at things oh I
[41:41] don't trust this brother oh this sister
[41:43] has done this that's your way of looking
[41:45] at it but then when you come under the
[41:48] blood under his presence then he gives
[41:50] you a whole different perspective then
[41:53] he tells him like now here's the program
[41:55] that I have for you amen you thought
[41:58] that you have nobody else but I'll give
[42:00] you
[42:00] Elisha that you're going to anoint
[42:03] because he's a representation of the
[42:06] 7,000 that is coming after then we
[42:09] started with Eli uh with j j that we saw
[42:14] that this Spirit of Communism that the
[42:17] prophet was showing us that
[42:20] people in this world that we are living
[42:23] in that the Lord also gave him also a a
[42:27] program in 1933 he gave him seven
[42:30] Visions under those seven Visions we saw
[42:33] that uh uh there was a stage where uh
[42:39] Fascism and Nazism that was reigning of
[42:41] all over the world that under these were
[42:44] going to be swallowed up under communism
[42:46] but then that communism when we look at
[42:49] it in the world that we find out that
[42:51] it's just known in the political side of
[42:54] things but then glory be to God that
[42:57] because God gave that program to the
[43:00] prophet the same Prophet along
[43:02] throughout the message we see that God
[43:05] started unfolding or breaking down the
[43:07] bread so we can understand those seven
[43:10] visions and what it means and how it
[43:13] applies in every SE sect of Life as we
[43:16] see it and we see that uh in the message
[43:21] uh question and answer um 64 19 uh 169
[43:26] down there that the day in sherp when
[43:29] that AR prise come them and there was
[43:33] all all of them young colored inspired
[43:36] out there communistic I've told you that
[43:39] here in this Pulpit M Martin Luther King
[43:42] is the greatest ende demment the colored
[43:45] peoples have have had right that man's
[43:48] going to lead a thousand of them to a
[43:50] Slaughter that's right inspired by
[43:53] communism and when we look at these
[43:56] wonderful scriptures
[43:57] you know in americaas things like this
[44:00] they always brings almost a riot among
[44:03] people it's like you can't speak about
[44:05] that you know nobody no it's not about
[44:08] what we think that Martin Luther was
[44:11] doing but it is what God wanted to show
[44:14] us but through his his messenger and as
[44:18] we see that Martin Luther in the years
[44:21] that we've seen you know everybody here
[44:24] I believe uh have a little bit of
[44:26] history of uh what America has been uh
[44:29] going through you know along the ages
[44:31] since uh slavery and uh emancipation and
[44:35] all these things but that not
[44:38] necessarily like you know the thing that
[44:40] usually we are dealing with here we are
[44:44] dealing with the word God's program
[44:47] because with God's program it unfolds
[44:49] and opens our understanding that it's
[44:52] not about
[44:54] racism because what people thought was a
[44:57] stumbling block in the message that why
[44:59] did the prophet say this like you know
[45:01] oh he can't say that no it's not about
[45:03] what we think but when we see when we
[45:07] leave all our ideas and we get the
[45:11] anointing of the Holy Spirit then we
[45:14] starts looking at these scriptures in a
[45:16] whole different
[45:18] perspective because we see that uh
[45:20] during this time you know it
[45:23] was
[45:25] emancipation civil right we are all
[45:29] equal yes everybody the prophet gives us
[45:33] those quotations he said like you know
[45:36] man God created all men free but man
[45:39] made his own his beloved brother and
[45:42] sister a slave it's not just to the
[45:45] black people but it's all over the news
[45:49] children go
[45:51] missing who are they who are kidnapping
[45:54] them
[45:55] fellow parents
[45:58] killing their own
[45:59] children
[46:01] uncles all these people doing these
[46:04] things not to the black people or black
[46:06] people to other black people but the
[46:08] world that of the internet we have today
[46:10] we start discovering all kind of things
[46:13] that people are doing to their fellow
[46:16] brothers why
[46:18] because they thought like you know we
[46:21] needed a a different life than what we
[46:24] think that life should be should look
[46:26] like
[46:27] and along the way as all this
[46:30] information were em
[46:32] emerging then people say well we need a
[46:37] different
[46:38] lifestyle we needed a society that is
[46:41] different from what they have presented
[46:43] us because remember in the last uh uh
[46:47] series we saw that what started uh in uh
[46:51] in Europe in the form of of uh of the
[46:54] Catholic Church came along in the United
[46:58] States and as it came along in the
[47:01] United States then it unfolded into a
[47:04] whole different system saying like you
[47:06] know we are free we are free yes yeah by
[47:10] looking at it it seems to be free but
[47:13] brother says
[47:15] otherwise brother Bram says that America
[47:18] is a bunch of slaves that are never seen
[47:20] in any part of the
[47:22] world these quotations are very tough
[47:25] when you just readed it
[47:27] because America we say land of the Brave
[47:31] home of the
[47:32] free you want to do in America you can
[47:35] do anything yes of course but that comes
[47:38] with a
[47:39] cost but glory be to God that God had a
[47:43] prophet unto him he had given a program
[47:47] and by giving him that program then the
[47:50] children of God we are able to see
[47:53] what's going on in the land because by
[47:56] just looking at America we say that it
[47:58] is we are free we can do anything we can
[48:02] marry whoever we want because in the
[48:04] time of Martin Luther people could just
[48:07] like you know do whatever they want they
[48:09] couldn't do everything they want they
[48:11] were uh uh tlets for for the blacks and
[48:14] the white and and everything this was a
[48:17] big struggle among the
[48:19] people then Martin Luther as we just
[48:22] read here he had an idea he said well we
[48:25] needed we needed different
[48:27] world because why Martin
[48:31] Luther says that he was a
[48:34] minister he was a
[48:36] leader and this leader wanted now a
[48:40] different lifestyle than what they had
[48:42] known before and to this day it is still
[48:45] a
[48:48] struggle they wanted a different
[48:50] lifestyle but despite of everything they
[48:53] wanted to do if it was not according to
[48:56] God's program everything they were going
[48:58] to do all the
[49:00] reforms that they were going to do will
[49:02] not
[49:03] work because it didn't come through by
[49:06] the
[49:07] blood because without the blood there's
[49:10] no remissions of sin and sin is
[49:14] unbelief and everything that we had
[49:17] known from the foundation of the world
[49:19] since Genesis that when Cain came and
[49:23] killed his own
[49:25] brother nothing think no reform gun
[49:28] reform was going to change mind of of
[49:32] Cain but it required the Holy Spirit to
[49:37] come into Cain for Cain now to be
[49:40] transformed to look at his own brother
[49:43] he is
[49:45] equal despite that everything that we
[49:48] will do all the the the the the the the
[49:51] the the all the the seminaries we will
[49:54] have that will never happen
[49:58] and as along the time we seen that
[50:01] Nation after nations from every part of
[50:05] the world brother as we read it last
[50:07] time 23 of the world now is
[50:12] communist why are we communist
[50:15] today why is the world turned into what
[50:19] we are
[50:20] today because it is God's
[50:24] program because he wants it to be
[50:28] so because he had seen a system that
[50:32] Nimrod had brought in among the people
[50:35] and he was he didn't agree with it then
[50:39] he said you my Prophet I'm giving you
[50:41] the
[50:42] charge to come and Proclaim these things
[50:46] so that my children so that elishah and
[50:50] the 7,000 people can be able to be aware
[50:54] of what's going on
[50:57] otherwise we'll be looking at communism
[50:59] and all this revolutions say like oh we
[51:02] are becoming a better a better people no
[51:04] there's not becoming a better people
[51:06] outside of the
[51:09] blood because as the people were not
[51:14] understanding to see that God has sent
[51:17] us a
[51:18] prophet and they take the prophet's
[51:20] message and they put it aside and they
[51:23] started correcting the prophet that also
[51:27] another bunch of Communists that we have
[51:29] in the message
[51:31] today because they think that they know
[51:33] better than the prophet but then when
[51:37] that pill of fire came down at his birth
[51:40] you and I were not there you and I
[51:43] didn't know that there was a p a pill of
[51:45] Fire coming down for a certain purpose
[51:48] and as the pill of fire was leading him
[51:51] and telling him do not smoke do not
[51:54] drink do not defile your body in any
[51:57] manner because I'll have a program to
[51:59] end to you when you shall grow you and I
[52:02] don't we do not have that kind of of of
[52:08] commission some of us when we stumble in
[52:11] the message is after living all kinds of
[52:14] Life some of us even after being in the
[52:17] message we live all kinds of
[52:20] life and after then we learn some few
[52:23] quotations left and right then we start
[52:25] telling the Prophet what to do then we
[52:28] start tell taking the scriptures that we
[52:31] think that can be preached upon why
[52:35] because we think that we know better
[52:37] than the prophet but the message of the
[52:41] hour is not a a a uh a piece of puzzle
[52:45] that you bring and you just draw your
[52:48] own picture out of it or a set of Lego
[52:50] that you building anything that you
[52:52] think that you should be building no but
[52:55] then we should go back to the prophet
[52:58] and tell us that you know show us the
[53:01] program because without the program we
[53:04] wouldn't know where to go we wouldn't
[53:07] know how to walk we wouldn't know what
[53:10] are we doing we wouldn't know what is
[53:12] happening among
[53:14] us because this communist Spirit when it
[53:17] comes in as we are going through it we
[53:20] see that people didn't even notice that
[53:23] you know we became a bunch of communists
[53:26] that's right yet being a communist we
[53:29] are here telling the prophet no the
[53:31] prophet is wrong here the prophet is
[53:33] here this here you know this is just the
[53:35] prophet saying it's not that said the
[53:37] Lord and all these things here but then
[53:40] Paul in the Bible says it is not the
[53:42] Lord but it is high and by him saying it
[53:45] is high it's in the Bible and John comes
[53:48] and say if you remove a part of it
[53:52] you're going to be strien by it from the
[53:55] Genesis to Revelation the whole entire
[53:58] Bible the way it is put up with Paul's
[54:02] writings that's right with Timothy's
[54:05] writing it is the word of God that's
[54:09] right and the word of God is the Lord
[54:11] himself speaking in the form of the
[54:13] Prophet right and people have hard time
[54:17] understanding that why because we a
[54:19] bunch of
[54:21] communist I'll prove it with the word
[54:25] amen amen
[54:26] and we see that God's God's
[54:29] preparation brother Bram is showing us
[54:31] how this communist Spirit goes on
[54:34] paragraph 37 he said I was parking my
[54:36] car in a parking lot around here a man
[54:39] said preacher what are you going to do
[54:42] about all these kids and this juvenile
[54:45] delinquency I said cut all this
[54:48] vulgarity on
[54:50] televisions and all this other kind of
[54:52] stuff like that and get that communistic
[54:56] Spirit started to moveing and it will
[55:02] move we didn't see it like that
[55:05] before we thought like you know
[55:07] communism is
[55:10] Russia but he says when he comes down he
[55:13] said like you know the two is will be
[55:16] swallowed up by the F by the third one
[55:19] which is
[55:20] communism then somebody comes and is
[55:22] wondering my child is not listening oh
[55:25] he's now a te teenager and all this year
[55:28] the prophet now start giving them the
[55:31] solution he say it's simple just remove
[55:35] the phone from the
[55:38] hands it's hard to be
[55:41] done nobody will accept that to
[55:45] happen why brother says but as long as
[55:49] the kids as got in in them drilled in
[55:53] them see it at home see it among the
[55:57] father and
[56:01] mother the father is with the phone
[56:03] every day with the on their
[56:06] hands the mother is doing the
[56:09] same what do you expect from the
[56:15] children what do we
[56:17] expect and we are looking for a better a
[56:21] better better a better generations to
[56:24] come but he said no it is drilled in
[56:28] them see it at
[56:30] home and he goes back and say that you
[56:33] know it is the father it is the mother
[56:37] because he is the one leading his family
[56:42] he is the one setting the example
[56:44] because the children can see that Dad
[56:47] and Mom do not Fellowship
[56:50] anymore why because of these
[56:53] televisions in our hands in our cars the
[56:58] mind now is turned somewhere else it
[57:01] says well walk down to school and act
[57:05] and act impudent and everything like
[57:08] that how can how can one Church do it
[57:11] brother we putting them into communist
[57:15] is a spirit not just a nation it's a
[57:19] spirit and the spirit what's warming
[57:23] into America
[57:28] and how is it warming into America it's
[57:31] not Russians coming down and telling us
[57:34] like you know we need to do all all this
[57:36] conspiracy theory of 2016 that oh the
[57:39] Russians have invaded our our elections
[57:43] and stuff
[57:44] no we are looking at it so far
[57:48] away but the Devil comes and say like
[57:50] you know just put it in your children's
[57:52] hand we will give all the reasons in the
[57:55] world
[57:57] oh my child will be away I need to track
[57:59] them down I need to know where they're
[58:01] going I need to see what they're doing
[58:04] exactly keep doing that but the prophet
[58:07] says remove that from their hands and
[58:11] see what will
[58:13] happen then now let's see if really we
[58:16] are communist or
[58:18] not because it is a
[58:21] challenge in this generation it was a
[58:24] challenge back then to keep the children
[58:26] away from Cinemas and all these things
[58:29] and now it is now FS
[58:32] now children are talking about being
[58:35] bullied online and all this things just
[58:36] take the whole computer
[58:39] away give them the bible to
[58:42] read amen it's warming into the
[58:45] churches it's warming into the into into
[58:49] into the schools it's warming into the
[58:53] individual
[58:56] that Spirit of Communism and communism
[59:00] is the thing that's breaking it down
[59:02] watch these high
[59:05] headed hty Americans and you see whether
[59:09] communism has got them or
[59:14] not the prophet says that the two first
[59:18] spirit will be swallowed up into the
[59:21] third and in the third now it's warming
[59:25] among the people it's is warming among
[59:27] the people I'm not telling the I'm not
[59:29] saying the bride but I'm saying like you
[59:31] know that's what is
[59:34] happening it's it's among the people
[59:37] don't don't never fear about the robin
[59:39] that that PS on the the hle hurting it
[59:43] it isn't the Rubin peeg on the on the on
[59:46] the Apple that hurts it it's the warm at
[59:49] the cold that gets the
[59:52] Apple the rotness that we see I'm not
[59:56] outside there because out there it's
[59:59] already polluted butam say I'll never
[1:00:01] pray for them anymore but then we see
[1:00:04] that the pro God said to the prophet I
[1:00:07] have
[1:00:08] 7,000 that have not bowed to
[1:00:12] Bow despite that baram says yes of
[1:00:15] course you'll find yourself you know
[1:00:16] doing a mistake here and doing a mistake
[1:00:19] there but you say like you know look at
[1:00:21] those high-headed people oh I I think I
[1:00:24] know what I'm doing you know I don't
[1:00:26] tell me how to raise my children yes of
[1:00:28] course that's how it's supposed to be
[1:00:31] you should have the responsibility just
[1:00:33] as the prophet was looking at Martin
[1:00:35] Luther said you know he's going to be
[1:00:37] the greatest inment to the people
[1:00:40] because they didn't he didn't see where
[1:00:42] he was Leading the People he just
[1:00:44] thought like you know this is a
[1:00:45] revolution let's have a new Revival and
[1:00:48] that Revival Martin Luther took the
[1:00:52] people and look at this it wasn't just
[1:00:55] the blood
[1:00:57] but among them all the other races all
[1:01:00] the other backgrounds also join the
[1:01:04] move and what did that produce freedom
[1:01:08] of
[1:01:10] everybody freedom of everybody everybody
[1:01:13] is now is able to do anything by them
[1:01:16] going into that
[1:01:18] system we see that after World War II
[1:01:22] brother Bram says that I saw that
[1:01:26] America technology was going to rise
[1:01:28] higher it was going to the the the the
[1:01:31] the development was going to get greater
[1:01:34] but by doing that brother bam says you
[1:01:37] see now the women now have left their
[1:01:41] position and went to into the war plant
[1:01:44] we'll read
[1:01:46] it and by them doing that now who was
[1:01:49] going to take care of the
[1:01:51] children the telephone now will take
[1:01:53] care of the children now television will
[1:01:56] do that
[1:01:58] now a bunch of Communists without even
[1:02:01] aware that we are
[1:02:04] communists the second coming and then
[1:02:07] the great people of this world pass by
[1:02:10] big blue shaded Cadillacs fine clothes
[1:02:13] and Rich and yet they tell us they tell
[1:02:16] us peace they they they tell him that we
[1:02:20] we uh we all come from one man we we on
[1:02:24] the equal what happen what's happening
[1:02:27] there like all the like the rest of the
[1:02:30] world communism is taking
[1:02:33] over and we the cause of
[1:02:38] it the cause of
[1:02:40] Communism is not Russia out there but it
[1:02:44] is
[1:02:45] ourselves because we are unable to see
[1:02:49] how it's finding a way in our
[1:02:51] homes how it's finding a way its way in
[1:02:55] our Liv
[1:02:57] lives because we thought that's what it
[1:03:00] is
[1:03:01] freedom wife go to work men go to work
[1:03:06] and let's have our sister-in-law or
[1:03:09] grandmother to take care of the
[1:03:11] children oh no I can't I can't leave it
[1:03:14] to uh I can't get it to to uh how do you
[1:03:18] call
[1:03:19] it babysitter
[1:03:21] Center stuff like that they care stuff
[1:03:25] but then will just have the children
[1:03:28] with somebody else a
[1:03:30] grandmother and the grandmother is like
[1:03:32] you know my my my little child child you
[1:03:36] know don't don't beat him you can do
[1:03:39] whatever you
[1:03:41] want but that was not her
[1:03:44] job the job was to the
[1:03:46] mother the mother has still has the
[1:03:49] energy to take care of the child the
[1:03:52] grandmother is already like you know
[1:03:53] done her part right she doesn't have the
[1:03:57] energy to deal with all the movement of
[1:03:59] the children
[1:04:02] anymore it's because of
[1:04:05] ourselves Grandma you going to take over
[1:04:08] are you going to be with Grandma yes
[1:04:10] he's excited she's excited why because
[1:04:13] he she knows with grandma with grandpa
[1:04:17] everything is
[1:04:18] allowed but with Dad around dad is a
[1:04:22] little bit more strict anytime that I
[1:04:25] have the possibility to go see Grandma I
[1:04:27] take the chance leave me there for the
[1:04:31] weekend that's right and brother Bram
[1:04:34] say he says you see he say we the cause
[1:04:37] of
[1:04:38] it communism comes in with a false
[1:04:42] economy and promise him something
[1:04:48] falsely because after World War II we
[1:04:52] needed we want to grow our economy
[1:04:55] we want to become the better a better
[1:04:58] people a more developed
[1:05:01] people because now the wife can also
[1:05:04] bring ideas to the
[1:05:08] table because if you don't allow women
[1:05:11] to
[1:05:12] work you are very traditional you are
[1:05:16] very
[1:05:18] oldfashioned and it is a still a
[1:05:20] stumbling block to this
[1:05:22] day as they are growing up all of them
[1:05:25] this year young sisters they are working
[1:05:28] there I need to go to school because I
[1:05:31] also need to be
[1:05:32] somewhere I need to have
[1:05:35] opportunities yes you have all type of
[1:05:37] quotations that you'll find in the
[1:05:40] word and that's why the Bible
[1:05:43] says I think I quoted it last time here
[1:05:47] it said that Isaiah 41 and in that day
[1:05:50] seven women shall take hold of one man
[1:05:53] saying we will eat our own
[1:05:56] bread why are they able to eat their own
[1:06:00] bread because they are able to
[1:06:03] work because it is good for them to
[1:06:09] work because if they don't work they
[1:06:12] find themselves a bunch of
[1:06:15] slaves because the very husband who was
[1:06:18] supposed to take care of her now will
[1:06:21] not turn her
[1:06:23] into words that we can't even use on the
[1:06:27] pulpit true it is a stumbling block
[1:06:32] today the very husband the very head the
[1:06:36] very Martin
[1:06:37] Luther who was a
[1:06:40] minister who was supposed to be anointed
[1:06:43] of
[1:06:44] God who was supposed to sit under the
[1:06:47] prophet of the hour to receive the
[1:06:50] anointing on how to lead a family how to
[1:06:54] lead the church he is the one now
[1:06:57] bringing now a false
[1:07:00] economy you go to work I go to work
[1:07:04] we'll make more money and then we'll
[1:07:07] have a better
[1:07:10] life and has she thought like you know
[1:07:13] this was good to
[1:07:15] see then she goes to work the children
[1:07:19] are left alone with the television with
[1:07:22] the smartphone now the devil Now find
[1:07:25] find its way into the
[1:07:28] children teaching them all kind of
[1:07:32] things by the time she's 9 years old she
[1:07:36] has the mindset of a 30-y old
[1:07:38] man she knows everything about other
[1:07:42] females everything about
[1:07:46] men and we say well we need to have a
[1:07:49] better
[1:07:52] life in the name of false
[1:07:57] economy brother Bram says we are the
[1:08:00] cause of
[1:08:04] it it is hard for people today to make a
[1:08:08] living with just one
[1:08:11] job but at the same time bam says but
[1:08:16] there's also
[1:08:19] Elisha there's also Elisha unto whom the
[1:08:24] understanding must be given
[1:08:27] because the world today seems like you
[1:08:29] know everybody has to work everybody has
[1:08:31] to work yes everybody has to work but
[1:08:34] unto what
[1:08:36] goal unto what
[1:08:39] goal the children are growing up no
[1:08:42] mother at
[1:08:44] home and when there's no mother at home
[1:08:47] then the very children now they come to
[1:08:51] church he when I was dealing with Sunday
[1:08:53] School in Colorado one of the child just
[1:08:55] comes and very disrespectful say like
[1:08:58] you know let me study this then you
[1:09:00] start looking what does your mother do
[1:09:02] oh mom mom works what do mom is at home
[1:09:06] oh you can
[1:09:08] see when brother bam says that we are
[1:09:11] the cause of it yes we are the cause of
[1:09:13] it because we think that we can teach
[1:09:16] the prophet better than we think but
[1:09:19] then when we get in the word then we
[1:09:21] start seeing how the prophet gives us
[1:09:24] all the necessary
[1:09:27] equipment each mother in its position
[1:09:31] each father in its position and
[1:09:33] everything just working fine and that's
[1:09:36] where now Elisha's Ministry comes into
[1:09:41] play because Among Us here we have a lot
[1:09:43] of
[1:09:47] elas and God is going to hold you
[1:09:49] responsible what did you do with the
[1:09:51] anointing that I gave to you we'll get
[1:09:54] to that I won't
[1:09:58] jump this perod of
[1:10:01] communism because I know right now even
[1:10:04] I know like you know it's a very tough
[1:10:06] subject to deal with when you say like
[1:10:09] you know now what are we going to do we
[1:10:11] have bills to pay of course you have
[1:10:13] bills to
[1:10:14] pay but until you are
[1:10:18] anointed you'll find yourself all your
[1:10:20] entire life paying bills and bills and
[1:10:24] bills and bills
[1:10:26] without resolving
[1:10:28] them they pay you 2,000 today it's not
[1:10:31] enough then they pay you 4,000 tomorrow
[1:10:34] it's okay now okay now let's leave uh
[1:10:38] our ZIP code let's move into a different
[1:10:39] zip
[1:10:41] code and when you move into a different
[1:10:43] zip code you find yourself in the same
[1:10:45] cycle
[1:10:47] again true and who is the cause of it we
[1:10:50] are the cause of
[1:10:53] it and yet we say brother Bram didn't
[1:10:56] know what he was talking about Jesus
[1:11:00] Christ true sir without the
[1:11:03] anointing without the program we are
[1:11:06] spinning around without understanding
[1:11:08] what we are
[1:11:11] doing he says now blind Bas he says now
[1:11:15] what's happened communism has has come
[1:11:18] down and told him it's all false and get
[1:11:21] him a false economy by giving him a hope
[1:11:25] said yeah that's the way they do they to
[1:11:29] do it that's the capitalist and so
[1:11:33] forth the Communist come and say that
[1:11:37] you know you see now in this capitalist
[1:11:39] Society you know nothing can really work
[1:11:42] we we have to work all of us that's a
[1:11:45] false hope brother bam
[1:11:48] says that's a false
[1:11:51] hope and while we seeing these things in
[1:11:54] the church
[1:11:56] churches you look at the church you look
[1:11:59] at the people outside just as it was in
[1:12:02] the time of in the time of Moses they
[1:12:05] saw that the bride the people the Jews
[1:12:08] were getting stronger he said what shall
[1:12:11] we
[1:12:12] do you say like you know let's put more
[1:12:14] work on them they lower the
[1:12:19] wages inflation always going
[1:12:22] high and people are saying they're not
[1:12:25] seeing
[1:12:26] that they're just wondering like you
[1:12:28] know oh we hope like you know if I get a
[1:12:31] new a new job then oh yeah yeah probably
[1:12:34] a better car and then a better clothing
[1:12:37] and then and then and then and then and
[1:12:38] then before they find them themselves
[1:12:40] they are always in dead until the day of
[1:12:42] Their
[1:12:45] Lives why the same system that started
[1:12:49] in
[1:12:52] Genesis when the economy was not working
[1:12:55] under
[1:12:56] Joseph but God had to give Joseph the
[1:13:00] understanding on how to
[1:13:03] work because it's going to get worse and
[1:13:07] worse and worse and as it's getting
[1:13:10] worse brother R I'm says it is necessary
[1:13:13] for that pressure to come about so that
[1:13:16] the bride can understand what they have
[1:13:18] to
[1:13:20] do but then when we look at it just look
[1:13:23] at it like that you said no oh it's not
[1:13:25] a it's not
[1:13:27] communism brother bam says he said he
[1:13:29] said the reason that's the reason it's
[1:13:31] done that is because of that we put our
[1:13:34] money on beer cans and cups and things
[1:13:37] like that and the missionary have to
[1:13:39] leave off of a penny off a penny march
[1:13:42] to come to to the altar about once once
[1:13:46] a month and brother we've sold we we
[1:13:50] going to reap what we sold you just
[1:13:53] remember that show
[1:13:56] everything that we are
[1:13:58] sowing the very children we are sewing
[1:14:01] because what we call Baby Boomers today
[1:14:05] is the result of after World War
[1:14:08] II and the baby the baby boobers are the
[1:14:12] generations that they didn't know
[1:14:14] parental
[1:14:16] control and the the great decision
[1:14:20] makers of the world that led the world
[1:14:22] into all the chaos that we see today are
[1:14:24] the Baby
[1:14:27] Boomers what we are sewing we are
[1:14:30] ripping and when we are ripping it and
[1:14:32] we are facing it and yet at the same
[1:14:35] time then God gives us a prophet warns
[1:14:39] us of the those things then people go
[1:14:42] about and they just repeat the same
[1:14:43] mistakes
[1:14:44] again but glory be to God that we have
[1:14:48] the
[1:14:49] prophet we have the message of the hour
[1:14:53] we have the Tes to understand so we can
[1:14:56] be able to
[1:15:00] see they didn't work yesterday yeah they
[1:15:05] kept all the money they invested into
[1:15:07] all kind of
[1:15:09] stupidity and today still the same thing
[1:15:12] they take all the money they send it
[1:15:14] offshore they tell you no we don't have
[1:15:16] enough money to pay the
[1:15:19] people and when they do that now now the
[1:15:22] pressure is upon you that I need need
[1:15:24] new shoes mother I need this here I
[1:15:27] can't be this way here okay now all of
[1:15:29] us let's go to work let all of us now
[1:15:32] communism start taking place in the
[1:15:33] children among the children and what do
[1:15:36] we expect of the Next Generation because
[1:15:38] they are the ones that will get married
[1:15:41] tomorrow and once they get married
[1:15:44] without any form of parental
[1:15:47] control any form of the word presented
[1:15:52] before them right they see that in the
[1:15:55] father that is always working
[1:15:56] hardworking father hardworking mother
[1:15:59] yes like you know that's what we need to
[1:16:00] do yes keep doing that but also look in
[1:16:04] the word and see what the result of what
[1:16:07] you're sewing what you're going to
[1:16:10] reap the resurrection of the
[1:16:13] Resurrection I believe that one of you
[1:16:16] right now after seeing what you have
[1:16:19] seen hearing what you have heard seeing
[1:16:23] his power and manifest station I believe
[1:16:26] that each one of you can go to your
[1:16:29] church and start a prayer
[1:16:32] yourself I believe you can turn this
[1:16:35] whole place in here and makes this town
[1:16:38] so dry from whiskey that the bootle
[1:16:42] would would have to Prime itself an hour
[1:16:44] to get enough motion to speed I believe
[1:16:47] that's the truth I here on the police
[1:16:50] force and everything that we are that
[1:16:52] they bootlegging whiskey in polce
[1:16:55] and they bringing in here what is what
[1:16:58] the trouble is they let down the bars
[1:17:01] and their churches and God
[1:17:03] formal everything else pollute the
[1:17:06] country and members of the church drink
[1:17:11] smoke gamble live like the rest of the
[1:17:15] world work like the rest of the world we
[1:17:18] do everything like the rest of the world
[1:17:21] butam says that's what broke communism
[1:17:24] lose in Russia believe th this because
[1:17:27] they have
[1:17:29] seen that everything that the Catholic
[1:17:32] church was
[1:17:34] doing we are doing the same
[1:17:37] thing no wonder today now the sisters
[1:17:42] now they can go and get anybody outside
[1:17:45] and bring them to church he's a nice guy
[1:17:49] I can marry him he leaves the church and
[1:17:52] goes outside she's a nice girl what why
[1:17:55] because there's no
[1:17:57] discernment because he and he or her
[1:18:01] cannot see the difference between a
[1:18:04] Christian and a
[1:18:08] pagan yeah we can just live like
[1:18:10] everybody
[1:18:12] else yeah he's just he's just a nice guy
[1:18:14] he speaks English he he has a job he has
[1:18:17] money you know he doesn't I've done the
[1:18:21] background check no that background
[1:18:22] check doesn't work on this
[1:18:25] that's right amen background check All
[1:18:28] These Years background check never
[1:18:31] depicted communism otherwise as brother
[1:18:34] bam says we should have closed all the
[1:18:37] bars closed all the whiskies and stuff
[1:18:40] but no all the money all the biggest
[1:18:42] investment is into the uh the casinos
[1:18:46] and into all the human trafficking and
[1:18:48] all these
[1:18:53] things background check never detected
[1:18:56] in even one of
[1:18:57] it not
[1:18:59] once and they come in the
[1:19:02] churches we see that this whole
[1:19:05] crumbling system is being destroyed
[1:19:09] because the very people who were
[1:19:11] supposed to present the good the the the
[1:19:14] the best example are now crumbling
[1:19:18] down and when it gets into the churches
[1:19:21] people who have a lot of money barabam
[1:19:23] says I believe in the second sale 153 he
[1:19:27] said now somebody who has money comes in
[1:19:29] the church and start telling the pastor
[1:19:31] Pastor God bless you Pastor you we we
[1:19:34] support your ministry Pastor so how okay
[1:19:39] so what do you want but Pastor you know
[1:19:41] certain things you know Pastor you know
[1:19:44] you know us you know we have to have our
[1:19:47] own group
[1:19:48] Pastor right in the
[1:19:51] church why because he has money
[1:19:55] he wants to bring now communism among
[1:19:57] the people bringing into all kind of
[1:19:59] type of ideas butam says you know the
[1:20:02] whole uh the whole air has become
[1:20:04] contaminated with with the power of the
[1:20:07] Underworld the power of Darkness we look
[1:20:10] out of the world now and find out around
[1:20:12] how communism waving its way in we could
[1:20:16] get out of the street here in America we
[1:20:20] we we take for instance like I was
[1:20:22] passing I was passing a place while ago
[1:20:25] in your city the lovely city you find
[1:20:28] that these matters outworking these War
[1:20:31] plans and things and that come in that
[1:20:35] come in their children with
[1:20:37] babysitters oh it's a disgrace that our
[1:20:41] America our American woman ever put a
[1:20:45] pair of overhauls and went to a war
[1:20:48] plant to work I don't care how much that
[1:20:52] hurts but it's a dis
[1:20:57] Grace brother brother is seeing that
[1:21:01] happening it was a disgrace yesterday
[1:21:04] but today is a normal
[1:21:06] thing it is a right for every woman to
[1:21:10] work with all the attached cation to it
[1:21:14] brother Bram also said if she's not if
[1:21:16] she's not yes of
[1:21:20] course until you receive the Holy
[1:21:23] Ghost you see what your position
[1:21:26] is God opens up the life of your
[1:21:29] children before you like Manoa with his
[1:21:33] wife went to the angel and showed to him
[1:21:37] tell us how are we going to raise this
[1:21:40] children besides that we are just
[1:21:43] raising any type of
[1:21:45] children we are just like you know yeah
[1:21:48] we are normal kid average kid you know
[1:21:50] they'll do this they'll oh you know it's
[1:21:52] just teenager's life you know before you
[1:21:55] know before you know it they're now
[1:21:56] turning to uh young adults and before
[1:21:59] you know it they're not interested in
[1:22:01] coming to church
[1:22:03] anymore because the father themselves
[1:22:05] the parents themselves the pastors
[1:22:07] themselves the ministers themselves they
[1:22:09] are unable to see
[1:22:11] it butam say we are just bunch of
[1:22:15] Communists without knowing without
[1:22:18] seeing it and all these uh you know
[1:22:21] short skirt high heels and makeups and
[1:22:25] you know uh clear nails and all these
[1:22:28] things and extension left and right
[1:22:31] and double life being lived yeah but
[1:22:35] when we look at it we don't see
[1:22:37] it but until we get the
[1:22:41] word you get into a
[1:22:44] church then you start seeing
[1:22:47] things as brother ROM said I'll come and
[1:22:50] I'll look at the sisters it's not the
[1:22:53] normal looking just say you go into a
[1:22:55] church you're looking at them no it's
[1:22:57] not that kind of
[1:22:59] looking he said like you know get to
[1:23:02] talk to them hear
[1:23:05] them because you go into a church some
[1:23:08] of the basic things you can see how
[1:23:10] communism has got even the simple
[1:23:13] education the simple
[1:23:15] manners a child doesn't even you he
[1:23:19] walks walks to a grownup they don't even
[1:23:22] know how to say hi
[1:23:25] some of the simplest
[1:23:28] things at times you meet them like you
[1:23:30] know they don't they look at you even if
[1:23:33] as if they didn't even see you they just
[1:23:35] pass why because they learn it at home
[1:23:39] and when you look at the parents the
[1:23:41] parents will do the
[1:23:44] same brother Bram says in Elisha's time
[1:23:48] the children they saw that at home
[1:23:51] that's why they came and said baldheaded
[1:23:53] men yeah they learn it at
[1:24:00] home these are these are some of the
[1:24:02] simple things that somebody's
[1:24:06] responsibility was not done because of a
[1:24:09] false
[1:24:12] economy because of like you know we're
[1:24:15] going to be better people we're going to
[1:24:16] be no it used to be yesterday hello
[1:24:20] mister hello Dad hello pastor and this
[1:24:23] and this here this builds up upon this
[1:24:26] right brother say if they had learned it
[1:24:29] at home they would have not behaved that
[1:24:32] way before the men of God and when that
[1:24:35] happened then the men of God also got
[1:24:37] angry then he cursed the
[1:24:40] children no wonder brother I'm going say
[1:24:43] like you know these Rick and
[1:24:45] rers I've told them preached them years
[1:24:49] after years they keep keeping cutting
[1:24:51] their hairs why because at home no
[1:24:54] nobody was able to do
[1:24:57] that because there was no mother like
[1:25:00] Moses mother to take off the child to
[1:25:02] teach him that you know you are a super
[1:25:05] race you are a peculiar
[1:25:08] people then now we can see now if
[1:25:11] somebody now behaving in that
[1:25:13] manner we see the
[1:25:16] children say what do you expect of the
[1:25:18] third generation just as it say like you
[1:25:21] know the Revival comes in big Revival
[1:25:24] everybody's excited then the next
[1:25:26] generation is start sloping down then
[1:25:28] the third generation there's almost no
[1:25:30] light to
[1:25:33] it and this communism
[1:25:36] spirit is finding its way
[1:25:39] in but then also there will also be
[1:25:42] Elisha's part you know what you supposed
[1:25:44] to do what are we doing and how we able
[1:25:48] to help others to be able to overcome
[1:25:51] the challenges of this world
[1:25:55] because the time is
[1:25:57] pressing because as we read it say the
[1:26:00] Bible says that you know the time the
[1:26:04] pressure it is for his reason because
[1:26:07] the child must be
[1:26:08] born but then if we are unable to see
[1:26:12] these things what yesterday seemed as
[1:26:15] Martin Luther a stumbling blog to speak
[1:26:17] about communism and the endeavorment
[1:26:20] that he's doing it's not just to the
[1:26:21] black
[1:26:22] people it's all over the World am all
[1:26:26] over the world the same system
[1:26:30] liberalism all kind of things that we
[1:26:32] can say here that we you are able to see
[1:26:35] out there but then it is now given us
[1:26:38] the
[1:26:39] responsibility to
[1:26:41] work to Stand
[1:26:45] Together by us looking inside but what
[1:26:47] I'm say then we start he said like you
[1:26:49] know forget not the family
[1:26:52] prayer those places that that the
[1:26:54] matters has to start back
[1:26:57] to and some of us have to get out there
[1:27:00] and
[1:27:02] work
[1:27:04] amen that's what the matter with the
[1:27:06] churches today you done get away with
[1:27:10] from from that River you got you got
[1:27:12] away from the gifts gifts of the holy
[1:27:14] spirit they got such a a church natural
[1:27:18] they got away from the spiritual gifts
[1:27:19] of the spiritual things they cast the
[1:27:22] fruit they believe because they live
[1:27:25] they live with the world act like the
[1:27:27] world Ste cheat Smoke Drink gamble have
[1:27:30] Bank parties in the church to pay the
[1:27:33] preachers and everything else super
[1:27:35] saers
[1:27:37] dances that's the result of
[1:27:41] Communism what people are looking
[1:27:43] forward today it's like you know just
[1:27:45] come to church and sit there Listen to A
[1:27:48] good sermon hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:27:50] amen Jesus loves you hey Jesus Jesus
[1:27:53] Jesus yes but that Jesus has a
[1:27:56] program he has a program he does not
[1:27:59] just save us for us just to sit like
[1:28:04] that but he saves us he gives us the
[1:28:08] understanding his mind in us for us to
[1:28:12] be able to
[1:28:14] see because if this generation Works
[1:28:18] harder then the next generation will be
[1:28:21] a better one but then if the the Lord
[1:28:24] inspires certain things then we must
[1:28:27] have work to
[1:28:28] do
[1:28:30] yes because as is a showing because
[1:28:33] along the time you can even see that in
[1:28:35] the message that when it started in the
[1:28:37] 50s speaking about communism until when
[1:28:42] after
[1:28:43] 56 then he start speaking about
[1:28:46] communism as Russia coming to destroy
[1:28:50] coming to do this year coming coming
[1:28:52] coming coming doing this year why
[1:28:55] because that generation didn't
[1:28:57] understand what he was explaining to
[1:28:59] them on that first part of his ministry
[1:29:04] amen and when the church doesn't get it
[1:29:07] then the Lord said you know I'll just
[1:29:09] start talking to them just like you know
[1:29:11] how we are going to heaven we are going
[1:29:12] to heaven we are going to heaven and
[1:29:14] then he says like you know in that day
[1:29:16] many shall come and say have I not
[1:29:19] preach have I not done this year have I
[1:29:21] not done this year
[1:29:24] why because they have rejected the word
[1:29:27] now they just want to hear what pleasing
[1:29:29] to them amen but it says like you know
[1:29:32] if we are able to
[1:29:33] see what is happening among us because
[1:29:38] if you says you know if God has to give
[1:29:41] us some something it has to be the
[1:29:45] best the best
[1:29:47] children the best people the best
[1:29:50] ministers but how do we end up with the
[1:29:53] best
[1:29:56] it's by kicking communism out
[1:29:59] amen by taking the word and putting it
[1:30:02] back in its place amen and when we start
[1:30:05] seeing the world taking place then you
[1:30:08] start seeing the atmosphere start
[1:30:11] changing then the Lord start will start
[1:30:13] not focusing now on how the bride should
[1:30:17] work and work and work and work for the
[1:30:21] emment of the Bride not for the
[1:30:25] world because all the Investments after
[1:30:28] we've done all the
[1:30:30] Investments after we've done we say like
[1:30:33] you know we are the land of the free how
[1:30:35] come we ended up now being
[1:30:39] slaves after we've done all the
[1:30:42] research after we said that you know we
[1:30:45] left Europe we come in America to
[1:30:47] worship brother said it started like a
[1:30:50] little lamb but then he ended up
[1:30:51] speaking like a dragon behind it what
[1:30:54] happened between is some of these little
[1:30:59] things it's because the matters were
[1:31:02] unable to find the
[1:31:05] position because bam says you mothers
[1:31:08] when your children went to school take
[1:31:11] your time go in your in your closet
[1:31:13] spend time in
[1:31:15] prayer but then is it the world in which
[1:31:19] we are living now
[1:31:21] today but at the same time this is not
[1:31:24] to be hard on the bride on the church
[1:31:27] because it says I also have 7,000 amen
[1:31:32] but then to the 7,000 it's not because
[1:31:35] we are the 7,000 that he hallelujah how
[1:31:38] that doesn't concern us no there's also
[1:31:40] work for us to
[1:31:41] do and that part of the work is also
[1:31:44] very important
[1:31:48] amen he said like you know that's what
[1:31:50] caus communism and the unbelief
[1:31:54] look and say there's no different in
[1:31:57] that person and me right that's what
[1:32:00] Comm communism to to rise in Russia
[1:32:03] that's the reason that they burn up the
[1:32:06] Catholic church
[1:32:09] in because very soon they'll say like
[1:32:11] you know if a gay person walks up here
[1:32:15] say like you know according to the law
[1:32:17] of the country you have to bless
[1:32:20] me what are you going to do
[1:32:25] people are facing that out there true if
[1:32:29] that happens here what are we going to
[1:32:31] do if some of the children we have here
[1:32:35] happens to them what are we going to
[1:32:39] do are we going to start looking yeah
[1:32:42] brother we'll pray for you no it's not
[1:32:44] about like you know waiting until it
[1:32:47] happens a prudent man yes should see it
[1:32:51] from from Far amen we should be able to
[1:32:55] work yes let's work
[1:32:57] church let not just have a church
[1:32:59] attendance coming when we want when we
[1:33:02] think like you know we go we watch all
[1:33:04] these movies especially in this
[1:33:06] generations of smartphones and iPads and
[1:33:10] and personal
[1:33:12] devices people are being polluted with
[1:33:15] all kind of
[1:33:17] things and it is a time for us to
[1:33:21] work people spend more time
[1:33:24] on Tik Tok Instagram and Snapchat and
[1:33:27] all these things grown young and
[1:33:31] everything except with the
[1:33:35] Bibles and they don't see that you go to
[1:33:37] the beach you put your clothes here you
[1:33:40] get in the water the waves are just
[1:33:42] taking you one step at a time one step
[1:33:44] at a time one step at a time by the time
[1:33:46] you realize you here and the clothes are
[1:33:49] there what happened the
[1:33:52] waves yeah
[1:33:54] you looked at one video oh I need to see
[1:33:56] more I need to see more I need to see
[1:33:59] more I need to see more before you know
[1:34:02] it you
[1:34:04] outside but then work must be done
[1:34:08] here we must work butam say I'm going to
[1:34:12] close this here butam says one day the
[1:34:17] Russians the level that communism was
[1:34:20] going to take he said the Russians will
[1:34:22] come here will take your home that you
[1:34:25] worked
[1:34:27] for take your child R them before
[1:34:32] you rape your wife and rape
[1:34:37] yourself and when that happens then
[1:34:40] you're going to remember we had a
[1:34:44] prophet look at what is happening in the
[1:34:48] Congo they take a
[1:34:51] man they tell a boy you're going to lay
[1:34:55] with your
[1:34:56] mother in front of the
[1:34:58] father after that they kill the the
[1:35:01] mother they cut the flesh they give to
[1:35:04] the child
[1:35:08] eat baram says it's going to happen
[1:35:16] here and now it is time for
[1:35:19] us to
[1:35:21] work brother says Russia is ahead of the
[1:35:26] US 5
[1:35:29] years but then when you look at it do
[1:35:31] you see
[1:35:32] it until Biden find out that the
[1:35:35] Russians are now building weapons to
[1:35:37] destroy the
[1:35:40] satellite then he discovered like you
[1:35:42] know we late we must work now butam said
[1:35:45] by the time we catch up the 5 years the
[1:35:47] 10 years
[1:35:49] ahead it is the
[1:35:51] end all the invest ments that we are
[1:35:54] doing everything that we think that we
[1:35:57] are investing better into for to provide
[1:35:59] us a better life it is the
[1:36:04] end look at what is happening in the
[1:36:08] Congo I'm going to give you the Cotes
[1:36:11] bam say that they have now Cobalt
[1:36:16] bombs today we are just talking about
[1:36:18] atomic bombs atomic bombs but it says
[1:36:20] that you know the Cobalt bomb are coming
[1:36:25] and now the Cobalt where is it coming
[1:36:27] from the
[1:36:32] Congo brother Bram we have received the
[1:36:36] prophet what we think that we know
[1:36:38] better than we can tell him what we can
[1:36:41] uhh correct him in certain things but I
[1:36:44] am going to guarantee you in this
[1:36:47] message that there are things that when
[1:36:49] you come
[1:36:51] across you'll be ashamed to even be
[1:36:54] alive you'll question yourself that if
[1:36:57] we are still
[1:37:00] Christians because he had seen these
[1:37:03] things
[1:37:04] happening and he is telling us that it's
[1:37:07] here it's among us but we don't see it
[1:37:09] but we we're still like you know going
[1:37:11] to church and just behaving like you
[1:37:13] know as as a normal life and all these
[1:37:15] things get married and do all these
[1:37:18] things go work as much as the Lord wants
[1:37:21] you to do it but at the same time time
[1:37:24] you must be anointed to see what is
[1:37:30] happening because when The Invasion
[1:37:34] comes he will be very late for
[1:37:37] us because there's a pro us who are
[1:37:41] alive and remain howsam says like you
[1:37:44] know no matter will be complete in
[1:37:47] heaven without her children that's
[1:37:49] right and it is not twice work and who
[1:37:53] is now the father who's going to be
[1:37:55] there without the wife and the
[1:37:57] children Billy Paul I have claimed you
[1:38:01] all that you have loved I given to you
[1:38:04] but yet the same Faith your children
[1:38:08] must come to that level The Church Must
[1:38:10] come to that level what good is it like
[1:38:13] you know oh the ministers come and they
[1:38:15] preach and they preach and they preach
[1:38:17] they get there is only five
[1:38:20] people why would the Lord come and
[1:38:23] Inspire the the ministers with the type
[1:38:25] of sermons that they are
[1:38:27] ministering because the Lord sees them
[1:38:31] the Lord see what's going on behind the
[1:38:33] doors when they are watching movies when
[1:38:35] they are on on Instagram and hours after
[1:38:38] hours after
[1:38:42] hours now it becomes now a norm now for
[1:38:45] the sisters and the brothers always
[1:38:48] pictures here pictures there pictures
[1:38:50] here pictures
[1:38:52] there if we we spend so much time with
[1:38:55] photo Photoshop editing the the pictures
[1:38:58] how much time are we spending in
[1:39:02] prayer because brother Bram says the
[1:39:05] amount of time that you spend with one
[1:39:07] thing double it do it for the
[1:39:13] Lord this is the time in which we are
[1:39:15] living
[1:39:17] in communism Among Us destroying and
[1:39:21] breaking down and in a very simple
[1:39:25] manner butam said regardless of all the
[1:39:28] Fashions and all the Investments that
[1:39:30] you do understand that none of it is
[1:39:33] going to make
[1:39:34] it
[1:39:36] none and when Russia comes over remember
[1:39:40] the seventh Vision musician come
[1:39:43] forward when the seventh Visions comes
[1:39:46] forward he said like you know I turn
[1:39:48] around and I saw it was destruction all
[1:39:51] over the place amen
[1:39:54] all the real estate all the banks
[1:39:58] everything none of it is going to
[1:40:02] stand but there is also investment to be
[1:40:05] made yes
[1:40:06] sir that's where Elisha comes into play
[1:40:10] the type of investment that must be made
[1:40:13] seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[1:40:16] everything else will be added unto you
[1:40:20] and we have these elas who have made
[1:40:23] this
[1:40:25] Investments that supposed to help
[1:40:29] us because you Elisha you see your
[1:40:32] brother your sister going through that
[1:40:36] wave of
[1:40:38] Communism and you are unable to
[1:40:41] [Music]
[1:40:44] help that's what Elisha supposed to
[1:40:48] do all that was in Christ it ped in
[1:40:54] Jesus and all that was in Jesus in the
[1:40:58] prophet all that was in the prophet it's
[1:41:01] available to
[1:41:04] us it is now our
[1:41:06] responsibility to
[1:41:08] embrace to work
[1:41:12] Galant it's not an easy work it's not an
[1:41:16] overnight
[1:41:17] work the time you realize that the child
[1:41:20] don't listen no more it's usually too
[1:41:22] late
[1:41:24] but if you were able to redeem the
[1:41:28] time work in that
[1:41:30] manner because
[1:41:32] remember say I saw in the
[1:41:35] discernment this child was stubborn the
[1:41:38] Spirit came from the parents and the
[1:41:41] grandparents so it is you take your
[1:41:44] child you raise them the way you rais
[1:41:46] them then you give them into
[1:41:48] marriage what kind of child are you
[1:41:50] giving
[1:41:51] away what kind of church church are you
[1:41:56] building because if I have the privilege
[1:41:58] to stand today it's not just because I
[1:42:00] am Brother Martin no somebody must have
[1:42:03] done the work yesterday it was tough why
[1:42:07] parents are like this why parents are
[1:42:09] like this yes my
[1:42:12] brothers yes our parents will be tough
[1:42:15] on us but it's for our
[1:42:20] good I know at times like you know it
[1:42:22] doesn't make say why do dad Mama behave
[1:42:25] this
[1:42:26] way but brother says if there's any
[1:42:30] better
[1:42:31] parents that he could have given to you
[1:42:34] is the one that you
[1:42:36] have and he says many times we think
[1:42:39] that Dad and Mom are
[1:42:41] wrong but he said that you find out
[1:42:43] always they're always
[1:42:46] right yes brother martin but I seen my
[1:42:49] father do this I've seen my mother do
[1:42:50] this yes
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:54] Abraham also in the Bible saw his father
[1:42:58] out there in
[1:43:01] Babylon he saw his father in Babylon but
[1:43:04] the same father took him out of Babylon
[1:43:07] and brought him into Genesis 12 that's
[1:43:09] where the Lord started dealing with
[1:43:13] him the same William Bram we call today
[1:43:16] prophet of the age prophet of the age
[1:43:17] look at the
[1:43:19] father a drunker
[1:43:24] yes that cannot be such a good example
[1:43:26] for you but yet at the same time God has
[1:43:29] given you that father to lead
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:33] you that may have went into all kind of
[1:43:37] stupidity yes I know that you can tell
[1:43:40] me here sit me here but imagine daddy do
[1:43:42] this mommy do this mommy did this and
[1:43:45] Mom doesn't this they don't respect each
[1:43:47] other they don't love each other they're
[1:43:48] not like yes at the same time those
[1:43:52] parents are the one that God has given
[1:43:55] you to lead
[1:43:56] you and because they've went through
[1:43:59] what they have went through they will
[1:44:01] not desire you to go through the same
[1:44:06] things and by the grace of God now
[1:44:09] parents will also have to understand the
[1:44:11] work they have to
[1:44:13] do it's not because I am father I can do
[1:44:15] whatever I want no because the Bible
[1:44:18] says parents do not also be a stumbling
[1:44:20] book to the children right
[1:44:23] Pastor do not be a stumbling block to
[1:44:25] the to the
[1:44:27] church it is a community h a common
[1:44:33] effort butam says the only good
[1:44:36] communism that we need is the holy ghost
[1:44:40] in the
[1:44:42] church he said there was communism one
[1:44:46] time it was at
[1:44:48] Pentecost he said that you know people
[1:44:51] had everything together they sold
[1:44:53] everything together they shared
[1:44:55] everything
[1:44:57] together that's the only type of
[1:44:59] Communism we
[1:45:03] want and when we do that that's where
[1:45:06] Elisha next time God willing that's
[1:45:08] where we begin with Elisha
[1:45:11] now Elisha must do the work we must be
[1:45:15] aware on how to labor because the last
[1:45:18] service the last series we ended up with
[1:45:22] he has redeemed red us from every nation
[1:45:25] every Kindred he has made us priest and
[1:45:27] all these things to do what to labor in
[1:45:30] the
