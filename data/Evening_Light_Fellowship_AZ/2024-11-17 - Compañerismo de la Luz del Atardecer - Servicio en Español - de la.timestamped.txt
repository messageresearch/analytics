[56:51] 27 y de la manera que está establecido
[56:55] para los
[56:57] que
[56:58] mueran una sola vez y después de este
[57:04] justicio esta mañana has tomado la
[57:06] palabra en tu
[57:08] corazón y que estás juzgándote tú mismo
[57:12] por la palabra de
[57:13] Dios yo estoy tan agradecido esta mañana
[57:16] que no estoy preocupado o preocupado por
[57:19] el trono blanco por la palabra de Dios
[57:22] me está hablando moviendo
[57:26] de moverme verso
[57:29] 28 así también Cristo fue ofrecido una
[57:33] sola vez para llevar los pecados de
[57:38] muchos y aparecerá por segura segunda
[57:43] vez Quiero poner aquí mi escritura en
[57:46] esta mañana hasta
[57:50] ellos hasta nosotros que ellos que están
[57:53] buscando
[57:56] aparecerse y la profeta dice nos va a
[57:59] decir muy específicamente si nosotros
[58:02] venimos a expectación que él va a venir
[58:04] y va a ad ministrar nuestro corazón y tú
[58:08] y danos exactamente lo que estamos
[58:13] espando
[58:16] continuando así también Cristo fue
[58:18] ofrecido que Dios les de que pueden
[58:22] tomar su lugar
[58:32] quiero traer a nuestra atención el
[58:35] mensaje que el hermano branam en ese
[58:38] mensaje dijo do una
[58:42] demostración habló de tener una cámara
[58:45] nueva y como hermano Billy Paul le dio
[58:50] una una 35 mm
[58:54] cámara y unos jóvenes no saben quién Qué
[58:57] es una cámara de 35
[59:00] mm pero es una cámara que tiene una un
[59:06] vio donde puedes focar hermano bran
[59:09] comenzó a decir cuando tú comas a tomar
[59:11] esa cámara y lo tomas y lo apuntas a un
[59:15] objeto y donde quiera estés y y habla de
[59:19] un cactus y tú lo comienzas a enfocar
[59:22] esa cámara y y tú ves por allí por la
[59:26] pantallita y comienza a ver y si y si no
[59:31] está bien el enfocam momento comienza a
[59:33] ver dos o tres cactos allí
[59:37] separan Pero si tú tomas esa cámara y
[59:40] comienzas a darle vuelta al al y
[59:44] comienzas a enfocar y comienzas a ver y
[59:48] comienzas a
[59:49] ver o qué tu deseo es para tomarle la
[59:53] foto y y comienza a enfocarse y luego
[59:56] dice Esa es la manera como como nosotros
[1:00:00] a veces nos salimos de
[1:00:03] enfocament el profeta dijo habla a una
[1:00:06] gente y comence a
[1:00:09] decir a veces ustedes se salen de
[1:00:13] enfoco ahora esta mañana yo deseo de mi
[1:00:16] corazón de traerte
[1:00:19] a te traerte algo que tú te mantengas en
[1:00:23] enfoco y mi pensamiento esta mañana es
[1:00:27] tratar de enfocar otra
[1:00:30] vez a veces vivimos en un mundo bien
[1:00:33] complicado cosas afuera del mundo y
[1:00:37] hemos visto est últimos dos semanas
[1:00:39] hemos visto mucha gente ha
[1:00:42] estado en el mundo de afuera y lo que va
[1:00:44] a pasar y y vemos Que cosas están
[1:00:48] complicadas y estamos comiendo muchas
[1:00:51] veces en en el mundo y todo su libertad
[1:00:56] y el la manera del mundo y las
[1:01:01] financias y a veces en nuestros aquí
[1:01:06] en Salud Mental y hay muchas presiones
[1:01:10] En esta
[1:01:11] edad hermano bran nos dice un mensaje
[1:01:15] una gran
[1:01:16] batalla y reconocimos que la batalla más
[1:01:20] grande peleada es en nuestra
[1:01:24] mente sabemos necesitamos ver un lugar
[1:01:27] donde debemos dejar la presión porque
[1:01:31] estas presiones son grandes en este
[1:01:34] tiempo nunca hemos tenido tantos
[1:01:37] suicidos gente pasando y cayendo por las
[1:01:41] las rajaduras y las presiones pero
[1:01:44] necesitan algo un lugar y este lugar es
[1:01:48] en el Jesús Jesucristo la palabra de
[1:01:51] Dios es donde se van a a dejar el
[1:01:54] presión Tom la palabra él misma y
[1:01:58] tomarla enfoco la Entonces como yo
[1:02:02] ministro ahorita y y y perdóname por mi
[1:02:05] voz pero si Dios me ayuda quiero
[1:02:09] darte
[1:02:10] aliento que tu vidas vuelvan para atrás
[1:02:14] enfocament en Jesucristo y yo veo aquí
[1:02:17] por toda la congregación y yo veo yo no
[1:02:20] no los conozco muchos pero pero eres una
[1:02:23] iglesia bien madura
[1:02:26] y y no hay nadie que podemos traer que
[1:02:30] que es algo más pero queremos ver lo que
[1:02:33] ya
[1:02:35] sabemos y traértelo aquí en un
[1:02:39] enfocament para ayudarnos en este camino
[1:02:42] de nosotros y sabemos
[1:02:46] que estamos en un ciclo de
[1:02:50] la de la
[1:02:52] resurrección y si vemos el libro de
[1:02:54] Apocalipsis no vamos a ir pero pero en
[1:02:57] tu corazón
[1:02:59] enfoco
[1:03:02] en y como Juan dijo yo Juan Yo me
[1:03:07] levanté y yo vi un cielo nuevo y una
[1:03:10] tierra
[1:03:11] nueva y él me dice en este tiempo Oh
[1:03:14] todas estas cosas han
[1:03:17] pasado todas estas cosas han pasado y
[1:03:20] este lugar estamos hablando el lugar que
[1:03:25] nosotros
[1:03:27] y con todo nuestro corazón y a ir Esa
[1:03:30] esa lugar
[1:03:32] celestial todos nuestros tiempos
[1:03:35] viniendo a la iglesia en domingos y los
[1:03:38] miércoles y nuestra oración y nuestro
[1:03:41] tiempo de estudio y viendo el mensaje de
[1:03:44] la hora es para un propósito Es para
[1:03:48] para ver nuestro jesú Cristo cara a cara
[1:03:51] y entonces reconocimos que Juan vio este
[1:03:56] lugar y todas estas cosas han pasado y
[1:03:59] este es un lugar porque los que han
[1:04:02] pasado y Dios eh desea que todos salgan
[1:04:07] de
[1:04:08] esto tenemos que sobrepasar yo nosotros
[1:04:13] mismos el gran enemigo es nosotros es el
[1:04:17] peor enemigo y el influencia y
[1:04:20] Tratamos de Y tratar de de somos más de
[1:04:26] de
[1:04:27] superadores entre Jesucristo no hay más
[1:04:30] dolores no hay más miedos no hay
[1:04:34] más tristezas en esa ciudad celestial no
[1:04:39] hay lugares para miedo no hay lugar allí

[1:04:59] una cosa real y comenza a crecer en tu
[1:05:05] en tu adentro yo le digo a mi esposa

[1:05:19] Dios en el día del espíritu y esa
[1:05:21] ansiedad y esos miedos y esas dudas
[1:05:27] y
[1:05:28] Jesús vino aquí de entre los discípulos
[1:05:31] y comenzó a hablar a ellos Oh yo voy a
[1:05:35] preparar un lugar por ustedes puedes
[1:05:38] hacer eso personal para ustedes el rapto
[1:05:42] el ciclo ese lugar ya está preparado

[1:15:31] fluyendo Yo pienso en esa esa fuente de
[1:15:36] vida que viene del trono de Dios Y esa
[1:15:38] unidad puede causar que todo nuestras
[1:15:41] barreras que que comienzan a sacarse
[1:15:44] hermano abam s dice si podemos estar ahí

[1:22:24] pero cuando tú vienes a Washington todo
[1:22:27] lo que puedes pensar es venir ahí a

[1:23:08] trono el que el que sembrare al
[1:23:14] espíritu del

[1:23:27] bien yo fuei creado en este mensaje y le
[1:23:30] doy gracias a Dios por eso que madre y
[1:23:33] padre fueron buenos cristianos pero eh

[1:23:38] acuerdo de ir a casa que el Dios va a
[1:23:41] venir este año siempre estamos viendo
[1:23:44] buscando por los señales y lo que el
[1:23:46] profeta ha hablado y Y cuándo va a ser
[1:23:50] el tiempo de irnos para casa pero Dios
[1:23:52] ha ha tardado pero
[1:23:54] Aunque
[1:23:56] estos han estado esperando a
[1:23:59] Dios pero no te
[1:24:01] canses dice el
[1:24:04] Señor no hay que estar en
[1:24:08] cosas
[1:24:10] porque porque no nos cansemos pu bien
[1:24:15] porque a su tiempo

[1:24:56] es la vida que vas a
[1:25:01] cerrar tú eres una reflexión directa de
[1:25:04] lo que eres
[1:25:07] allá entonces si hermano dice si tú
[1:25:12] sembrar es la
[1:25:14] palabra y vas a segrar la
[1:25:18] palabra Eso es una frase del profeta
[1:25:22] pero el hermano Steve

[1:25:56] y y recibir la sericordia de Dios y Asa
[1:26:00] decía a
[1:26:02] nosotros nuestra justicia a nuestra
[1:26:06] justicia personal es como trapos de
[1:26:10] inmundicia no hay nada en todo tu
[1:26:13] avistamiento todo lo que quieres hacer y
[1:26:15] está bien pero el hermano profeta nos
[1:26:19] has dicho a nosotros pero tú en tu
[1:26:22] justicia caminando como si tú eres un
[1:26:25] caminando tu una manera con tu gorra y
[1:26:28] tu cinto como trapos de
[1:26:34] inmundicia la Biblia dice necesitamos
[1:26:37] Buscar el reino de
[1:26:39] Dios
[1:26:41] y su
[1:26:44] justicia y yo he visto esto en el hebreo
[1:26:47] de justicia y dice
[1:26:49] que que un balance cuando a buscar elino
[1:26:55] est
[1:26:56] su su bal justi Entonces estamos

[1:27:10] vestimiento con
[1:27:12] nosotros no hay nada que podemos
[1:27:15] hacer pero él cambió con
[1:27:23] nosotros
[1:27:25] amoroso por ese uno que es amoroso que

[1:27:32] no ha dado ha dado su vida ha dado su
[1:27:36] sangre
[1:27:37] precioso para el
[1:27:40] sacrificio A veces tenemos que ir para
[1:27:43] atrás a la
[1:27:45] cruz vemos un lugar muy largo de donde
[1:27:48] Dios nos salvó la cruz nos salvó pero
[1:27:52] quiero que saben que atrás y podemos ver
[1:27:56] amigos que era por su
[1:27:58] gloria su gracia que somos lo que somos

[1:28:12] justicia no ya no es bueno para estar en
[1:28:16] tu espejo y yo soy un
[1:28:20] perdedor her por ibas decir algo así
[1:28:24] porque hay muchos
[1:28:26] creyentes que se ponen al frente del
[1:28:29] espejo y dicen que yo no valgo
[1:28:32] nada no eres una persona que no vales
[1:28:36] nada Dios te vio como el cordero de
[1:28:40] Dios había
[1:28:43] mucha no no le gustó su su cuerpo Estos

[1:28:49] mensaje en miedos y ansiedades en
[1:28:51] lugares de de tormenta de comienzan se
[1:28:56] comienzan a odiar ellos mismos y luego

[1:29:06] ustedes hay hay una esposa que dio un
[1:29:09] niño y estaba en depresión en postparto
[1:29:13] y neita un toque de Dios que Dios ve esa
[1:29:17] mujer o hombre o lo que sea no no tienen
[1:29:20] culpa están bien adelante de Dios
[1:29:26] cuando comenzo a saber de de sembrar
[1:29:29] estamos hablando espiritual de
[1:29:32] de de enterrar estamos plantados en
[1:29:36] Cristo la Biblia dice en Juan
[1:29:39] dice como una trigo cae en la tierra y
[1:29:43] muerte y pero sale va a traer vida
[1:29:50] nueva y sies
[1:29:55] de la de la mata original yo pensé
[1:29:59] hermano tú tienes una mata de
[1:30:02] naranja y si es fuerte y es tiene fruta
[1:30:07] natural pero tú cortas esa naranja pero
[1:30:10] tú debes ver semillas
[1:30:12] adentro a mí me gustaría que no tengan
[1:30:16] semillas vas a la marqueta
[1:30:18] y Pero eso no es una fruta original La
[1:30:22] que no tenga semilla pero tú tomas esa
[1:30:24] naranja y garas esa mía y tú quieres
[1:30:27] hacer y plantarla en la tierra qué va a
[1:30:30] hacer va a traer vida otra
[1:30:34] vez y tú estás plantada En
[1:30:38] Jesucristo entonces todas esas cosas han
[1:30:41] pasado romanos
[1:30:43] 6 que que nuestro hombre viejo está
[1:30:47] crucificado con
[1:30:50] él Entonces tú estás plantado
[1:30:56] dice porque él que ha muerto ha sido
[1:31:00] justificado del pecado y plantado en
[1:31:04] Cristo
[1:31:05] y sobrevivimos otra
[1:31:08] vez hablamos de nuestra escritura de
[1:31:12] Justicia que tú te juzgas ahorita por la
[1:31:15] palabra de Dios tú vasas subir tú eres
[1:31:19] parte de Simiente original vas a traer
[1:31:23] vida
[1:31:25] original tamb bien conmigo ahorita esta
[1:31:29] mañana romanos capítulo
[1:31:38] se aquí
[1:31:41] dice Sabiendo esto que nuestro viejo
[1:31:44] hombre fue crucificado juntamente con él
[1:31:48] y también caminamos pued esta sabiendo
[1:31:52] que Cristo habiendo res ya muerte la
[1:31:55] muerte no se ensoñar más de él estamos
[1:31:59] hablando aquí de enfocament
[1:32:01] aquí a veces las cosas son tan afuera de
[1:32:05] enfocament te estoy tratando de darte
[1:32:10] anelo que no te quedes afuera de enfoco
[1:32:13] no eres una persona mala Dios te ve sin
[1:32:17] culpa no lo único que él quiere ser él
[1:32:19] quiere que tú te enfoc te enfocas otra
[1:32:23] vez
[1:32:25] porque nosotros tenemos plantados juntos
[1:32:29] en la
[1:32:31] vida
[1:32:35] Porque para Dios vive también vosotros
[1:32:38] consideramos muerte al
[1:32:40] pecado
[1:32:43] señor y también sembrando
[1:32:46] dice hablando de un
[1:32:50] sacrificio Pablo aquí a los romanos si
[1:32:52] te acuerdas
[1:32:55] verso
[1:32:59] 12 por las semic corias de
[1:33:02] Dios que tú
[1:33:05] presentes que tú presentes tu vida tu
[1:33:07] cuerpo como
[1:33:09] una no estamos Dios no está
[1:33:13] viendo quiere sacrificios
[1:33:16] vivientes presenta tu tu tu sacrificio
[1:33:20] viviente adelante de Dios Entonces para
[1:33:23] ser tener un sacrificio
[1:33:26] necesita necesita haber un
[1:33:30] altar y para ver esto aquí vemos la
[1:33:35] altar de Dios comenzamos a ver para
[1:33:38] poder llegar í a los santos de
[1:33:42] Santos tienes que pasar por el
[1:33:45] altar y vemos aquí que cada uno de
[1:33:49] nosotros necesitamos venir a un lugar de
[1:33:52] un altar
[1:33:54] y no más es una vez o dos veces pero
[1:33:57] cada siguiente día tenemos que presentar
[1:33:59] nuestra
[1:34:01] vida adante del altar de Dios vemos el
[1:34:05] reyes de Elías y des construyendo el
[1:34:10] altar otra vez Tenemos que tener en
[1:34:12] nuestra vida un altar cone Dios no puede
[1:34:14] encontrar pero un altar en la escritura
[1:34:17] quiere decir una parte de de de Dios
[1:34:21] puede juntarte donde Dios se junta con
[1:34:23] sus hijos y en Génesis 4 verso 4
[1:34:30] dice trajo su primer de su y abé trajo
[1:34:35] también de los primogénitos de su ovejas
[1:34:39] de lo más gordo de ellas y miró Jehová
[1:34:43] con argar alabel y su ofrenda Caín sabes
[1:34:47] que tenía una revelación él le gustaba
[1:34:50] cosas bonitas le gustaba la música y
[1:34:54] muchas luces él quería quiere que
[1:34:59] sea quiere que que tuviera muchas vistas
[1:35:03] sobre todo la la internet y música Mira
[1:35:08] hermanos no nos gusta queremos
[1:35:13] cantos música espiritual y yo veo en
[1:35:17] este lugar y no estoy diciendo n más
[1:35:19] porque yo yo noto cuando Nosotros
[1:35:22] sabemos
[1:35:24] Yo oigo al hermano ron predicar pero
[1:35:26] siento la presencia de Dios porque es
[1:35:28] una un ungimiento hermanos y hermanas
[1:35:32] que están llenos del espíritu santo que
[1:35:34] tienen relación que está haciendo en la
[1:35:37] corazón por la música Tú sabes que la
[1:35:40] música puede
[1:35:42] sanar recuerdas
[1:35:45] aú él estaba todo torado en su mente y
[1:35:50] trajo David y comenzó a decir
[1:35:54] allí y que el señor es
[1:35:58] mi
[1:35:59] Cordero yo no y el espíritu de Dios
[1:36:03] comenzó a
[1:36:04] levantar y el espíritu entró el cuarto
[1:36:08] ahí como una fragancia Oh amigos es como
[1:36:11] una
[1:36:12] fragancia comienza a subir en el
[1:36:16] cuarto y Abel garó una revelación y
[1:36:21] sacrificio frente de un altar y Génesis
[1:36:25] 12 que también vemos que aquí aquí en
[1:36:31] Abraham dice
[1:36:34] aquí apareció Jehová en Abraham y
[1:36:37] crónicas primero 21 y David creó un
[1:36:41] altar a frente de
[1:36:44] Dios y ofreció
[1:36:46] una un sacrificio y cuando Dios vi ese
[1:36:50] sacrificio y Dios muchas veces respondió
[1:36:52] por lumbre
[1:36:55] Quiero que sepas también que un
[1:36:59] altar que neit llegar un altar antes de
[1:37:03] poder encontrarlo al Trono tienes que
[1:37:05] tener una experiencia al altar con Dios
[1:37:08] la altar no es un lugar muy
[1:37:12] glamoroso quiero que hablar no n más en
[1:37:15] natural pero quiero traértelo aquí a tu
[1:37:18] corazón porque tu corazón es el altar
[1:37:23] es donde tú encuentras al Señor cara a
[1:37:26] cara en el testamento
[1:37:29] viejo estaban creaban altares podían
[1:37:33] hacer cienes de altares y no sea nada
[1:37:35] bueno pero Dios quiere quiere verte
[1:37:38] encontrarte allí
[1:37:40] adentro quiere estar allí en esa torre
[1:37:43] de control tienes que morirte a ti mismo
[1:37:46] cada
[1:37:50] día pero un altar tradicionalmente
[1:37:53] no es un lugar
[1:37:54] glamoroso no es una parte estéril es una
[1:37:58] parte donde hay mucha sangre y dolor y
[1:38:02] sufrimiento y Tú comienzas a morirte
[1:38:04] allí
[1:38:09] mismo es a veces es vergonzoso pero te
[1:38:13] quiero
[1:38:14] decir en un altar es cuando tú traes tu
[1:38:18] vida
[1:38:20] quebrada Y tú eres renovado
[1:38:24] el altar es Cuando tú vienes vienes tu
[1:38:28] matrimonio
[1:38:31] quebrado y un altar es y traes los
[1:38:36] nombres de tus hijos
[1:38:40] perdidos tus hijos o
[1:38:43] tus familia si necesitas un trabajo y tu
[1:38:47] altar es donde tú traes la voz Dios Yo
[1:38:50] neito yo neito algo si tú enferma el
[1:38:54] altar en tu corazón es donde tú traes tu
[1:38:57] necesidad frente de
[1:39:00] Dios un Dios que él sí se preocupa el
[1:39:05] altar es un lugar de
[1:39:08] humildad primera Pedro
[1:39:12] 56 que se
[1:39:15] humillen allí abajo de la mano de
[1:39:22] Dios para tomar tu vida y tomarlo ahí en
[1:39:26] el altar de Dios es una una cosa muy de
[1:39:31] humilde para
[1:39:33] admitir
[1:39:35] que los hombres A veces noan admitir que
[1:39:38] están
[1:39:42] malo regla número uno yo siempre estoy
[1:39:45] correcto número dos si estoy si no estoy
[1:39:48] incorrecto ver regla
[1:39:51] una verdad
[1:39:55] muchas veces si yo
[1:39:58] Admito que tú estás diciendo Entonces
[1:40:00] los dos vamos a estar
[1:40:04] mal que los hombres no les
[1:40:07] gusta Yo soy natural como todos como
[1:40:13] ustedes hermano r Quiz no me va a tener
[1:40:16] aquí otra vez pero qu tengo que perder
[1:40:20] es como yo y tú amamos al señor
[1:40:23] y tenemos que llegar a un lugar donde
[1:40:25] somos gente humilde que puesto nuestras
[1:40:29] vidas aquí en Altar como un sacrificio
[1:40:32] pero siempre siempre me estoy quitando
[1:40:34] del altar es el problema un sacrificio
[1:40:37] tiene que estar ahí en el altar qui
[1:40:40] sostenerse pero el problema
[1:40:42] es que yo siempre me estoy saliendo
[1:40:46] porque es suficiente yo digo pero Dios
[1:40:50] quiere que nos mantengamos allí
[1:40:53] en Altar humilde sin ni una
[1:40:58] palabra él era un
[1:41:05] sacrificio cuando vemos esa ansiedad y
[1:41:08] que quizás ya no podemos seguir más
[1:41:10] adelante pero la tar es un lugar donde
[1:41:12] tú puedes expresarte al frente de
[1:41:17] Dios much hamos encontrado muchos
[1:41:20] altares por nuestras familias

[1:57:09] abajo neito estar sen Porque mucha gente
[1:57:12] mucha gente no cree esto tengo que ser s
[1:57:15] pero el altar es un
[1:57:17] lugar para poner una espada y quitar tu
[1:57:21] orgullo

[1:58:25] Yo creo que el altar en nuestro corazón
[1:58:26] yo sé que no consr tú puedes darte todo
[1:58:29] í tu asiento pero si tú tienes algo un
[1:58:32] orgullo a veces una manera es es bueno

[2:00:31] puede caer la
[2:00:34] lumbre vas a venir a un lugar donde vas
[2:00:38] vas a terminar
[2:00:41] terminado vamos a adelantarnos un
[2:00:43] poquito vamos a ver que que Ah era un
[2:00:48] creyente
[2:00:49] medio no creía muy bien
[2:00:52] era un que creía suficiente para para
[2:00:56] hacerlo miserable No no ha visto gente
[2:00:59] así tienen suficiente Concepción que les
[2:01:03] gustaría venir a la
[2:01:05] iglesia quieren
[2:01:07] venir le van a hacer una persona más
[2:01:09] social una vida
[2:01:11] social y quizás
[2:01:16] por quizás van a
[2:01:20] venir persona muy miserable que venga
[2:01:23] aquí yo te digo la cosa
[2:01:27] mejor dejando
[2:01:33] cosas
[2:01:34] dice cortar esas cosas o no ir no o
[2:01:39] ir yo yo ayudé con hermano Hero
[2:01:43] and y dice que que manda su Saludes yama
[2:01:46] a cada uno de ustedes pero nuestra
[2:01:48] iglesia yo no creo que hermano John iba
[2:01:50] a decir tú vienes aquí con un propósito
[2:01:53] o no
[2:01:55] vengas
[2:01:56] Hero no queremos que la gente venga pero
[2:02:00] abajo de la aquí el profeta está
[2:02:03] diciendo o tú te sales vienes preparado
[2:02:07] vienes con un deseo o no
[2:02:13] vengas ca el principio de esto el
[2:02:17] espíritu que que el profeta está
[2:02:19] diciendo aquí que vengo con una buena
[2:02:21] actitud que viene de un Deseo encontrar
[2:02:23] a Dios para que la lumbre caiga para que
[2:02:27] esa experiencia de Dios puede estar en
[2:02:29] su
[2:02:31] vida y como vamos a cerrar vamos a
[2:02:35] ver a capítulo de Reyes aquí
[2:02:39] Leo está confrontado
[2:02:42] con con unos profetas
[2:02:46] falsos y lo ve la gente y le dice estas
[2:02:50] palabras tanto tiempo vas a estar ahí
[2:02:54] entre dos
[2:02:58] opiniones qué tanto
[2:03:00] tiempo vas a mantenerte allí sin
[2:03:06] enfoco qué tanto tiempo vas a hacer
[2:03:09] decisiones entre la palabra que ha dicho
[2:03:12] en esta edad o vas a vivir por ella o
[2:03:16] eso que está en el mundo que tú ves todo
[2:03:19] en tu en tu video tu teléfono quién vas
[2:03:23] a
[2:03:24] servir
[2:03:28] ves hay muchos ídolos en nuestras
[2:03:32] vidas Hay cosas quebradas lugares
[2:03:35] quebradas en nuestras
[2:03:36] vidas
[2:03:38] y y es natural en nuestr corazones que
[2:03:42] nuestro Corazones nos condena volviendo
[2:03:45] para atrás a Jesús Cuando tú te sientas
[2:03:48] mal de algo que has
[2:03:50] hecho sientes mucho orar porque está
[2:03:53] disponiendo no
[2:03:56] crees Se llama se llama condenación que
[2:03:59] cae sobre ti y estas cosas en nuestras
[2:04:02] vidas que ponemos mucha atención son
