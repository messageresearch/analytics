[40:07] that's right that's true don't take it
[40:09] lightly that's true as the great day
[40:13] approaches it should be at the top of
[40:15] our priority list is to come into the
[40:19] house of
[40:21] God if you have your Bibles
[40:25] let's turn into to the Book of Genesis
[40:28] and before I get
[40:30] started um being one who helps with Camp
[40:34] I know it's been a week and a half since
[40:36] we've had camp but as one that helps
[40:38] with Camp I I certainly want to uh say
[40:42] thank you first to our pastor for a
[40:45] vision of having camp for the young
[40:47] people it's been 14 years and serving
[40:50] and all that he does in that vision for
[40:53] without a vision the people perish right
[40:56] and we have a vision for the Next
[40:58] Generation that comes up under us and we
[41:01] want to thank the youth leaders those
[41:03] that they're the core group that are in
[41:05] charge of putting games Brother Justin
[41:07] sister Jen and um my wife and sister
[41:10] Hannah they had the hit of camp and they
[41:12] put on a coffee bar and uh sister Ashlin
[41:17] there's one that you know behind the
[41:19] scenes in every Camp it always happens
[41:21] there's one that always works a little
[41:24] bit more Works a little bit harder more
[41:26] respons responsibility and there's
[41:28] things that you know it just doesn't go
[41:31] as planned you have ones that back out
[41:33] and ones that want to come and different
[41:36] things and even going up to camp we had
[41:38] a cabin right at the last minute we were
[41:40] in PAC and they call us and say this
[41:42] one's off so 14 people we got to have
[41:46] space for 14 other people and and two
[41:49] counselors you know it's just a headache
[41:51] but yet she works so hard on that and
[41:53] she does a lot of the preparation so we
[41:56] certainly want to say thank you to her
[41:58] and to our camp
[41:59] nurse and uh I do want to say thank you
[42:02] to my mom for driving the bus how many
[42:05] of that was a blessing all the parents
[42:07] that didn't have to drive up there what
[42:10] a blessing that was and she does it out
[42:13] you know she just wants to do it as a
[42:15] servant and we just ask the Lord would
[42:18] bless her and all the counselors that
[42:20] helped us and I have a couple of
[42:22] pictures because you know I believe that
[42:25] you know in the mission field and going
[42:28] out I I believe that there's a call and
[42:30] you know if the Lord opens the door for
[42:31] us to do it but I believe that the young
[42:33] people there's a mission field within
[42:35] our own homes and right amongst us and
[42:39] as young people it is a priority that we
[42:41] put them first so if we can show just a
[42:43] couple of photos here we have our camp
[42:45] nurse go ahead brother Ethan we had the
[42:47] group
[42:49] photo that was the hit we might have to
[42:52] open one up out here in the
[42:55] coffee that's
[42:58] some of the other counselors brother
[42:59] Matt brother Burley were our guest
[43:01] speakers these brothers had a hard time
[43:03] counseling all the paintball
[43:06] group brother Ron and brother berley
[43:09] there that was the camp
[43:11] there and then go ahead and I have one
[43:14] video and a couple of pictures of the
[43:18] baptism so this was the setting
[43:22] here can we get it
[43:25] unmuted if not that's okay
[43:32] okay it's just a 30 second clip
[43:39] here and go ahead and show the
[43:46] pictures I believe this is Brother uh
[43:49] Jonathan here I'm not
[43:51] mistaken and then brother
[43:57] I forget his
[43:59] name I have it right here and I don't
[44:02] want to mess that
[44:04] up aimu is that
[44:07] right but the reason we show these
[44:10] things is because there's a lot of you
[44:11] that have have contributed into this
[44:13] effort ones have come unto me and said
[44:15] brother James I'd like to pay somebody's
[44:17] way I'd like to donate I'd like to give
[44:19] but maybe that offering that you gave
[44:21] maybe it was one of these boys maybe it
[44:23] was something that God did he changed
[44:25] one of these lives here at camp because
[44:27] I believe it's a mission fill within
[44:29] itself I believe it's a great priority
[44:32] that we must place on the young people
[44:34] because let me just share this one
[44:36] little part I had a counselor come to me
[44:38] and they said brother James you know it
[44:40] was It was kind of sad we were sitting
[44:42] around and I'm just going to be vague
[44:44] with it but there was within my own dorm
[44:46] there was four to six out of probably 10
[44:48] to 12 that are in a counselor's dorm
[44:51] between four and six come from a broken
[44:54] home that are struggling with something
[44:57] come from a broken home and you know the
[44:59] sad part about it
[45:02] Saint homes within the
[45:04] message how rampant is this going on
[45:07] right now that Satan's coming and
[45:09] seeking whom he may devour if you
[45:11] believe this message is true and you
[45:13] want to serve God with all you got guess
[45:16] what he's coming for you and if he can't
[45:18] get you he's going to go after your wife
[45:20] and he can't get your wife he's going to
[45:21] go after your kids if he can't get your
[45:24] kids he's going to go after your health
[45:27] yes sir that's the importance of having
[45:31] these
[45:32] meetings yes so we certainly want to
[45:35] thank all those that were involved and
[45:37] those that gave
[45:40] and we just thank the Lord for what he
[45:43] did amen that if one Soul gives their
[45:46] life to God it's all worth it it's all
[45:49] worth it let's just bow our heads and
[45:51] our
[45:55] hearts our gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[45:59] we humble ourselves in your presence
[46:01] once again
[46:04] Lord sometimes we feel inadequate and
[46:08] unable but father it's not our own
[46:10] ability that we're lending on but we're
[46:12] trusting in you that you would come and
[46:14] that you would break the bread of life
[46:16] to us that you would open our eyes of
[46:18] understanding that you would give us a
[46:20] word in due season father and we're just
[46:22] asking that you would Minister to hearts
[46:24] that you would Lord change lives and as
[46:27] the word Goes Forth may it have an
[46:29] effect upon the people for what good is
[46:31] it to just Minister words and it was
[46:34] good to be in the house of God and it
[46:35] doesn't have an effect it doesn't drop
[46:37] into the soul father May the word fall
[46:40] into good ground that it might bring
[46:42] forth life and so father as we humble
[46:45] ourselves take our inabilities and make
[46:47] them your ability this evening I pray
[46:49] you be with the people be with those
[46:51] that couldn't be with us father I'm
[46:53] reminded I'm just asking a special
[46:55] blessing upon brother Matt Aon and his
[46:58] family they lost his father this Sunday
[47:01] father may you go and Lord may you be
[47:03] that tender hand oh God may you just
[47:05] comfort him through this this hard time
[47:08] and as the funeral approaches oh God may
[47:10] you just touch him in a special way him
[47:12] and all the family we commit this
[47:15] service into thy hands For Your Glory in
[47:18] Jesus name amen and
[47:21] amen praise the Lord Genesis
[47:24] 1:1 we're going to kind of pick up a
[47:26] little thought from the last time I
[47:27] don't want to
[47:30] repeat but it's something that God's
[47:32] been dealing with
[47:35] me Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God
[47:38] created the heavens and the Earth and
[47:40] the Earth was without form and void and
[47:44] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[47:47] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[47:49] face of the waters and God said let
[47:51] there be light and there was light and
[47:54] God saw the light that it was good and
[47:56] God did divided the light from Darkness
[48:00] now let's skip down to verse 14 and it
[48:02] says and God said let there be lights in
[48:05] the firmament of the heaven to divide
[48:08] the day from the night and let them be
[48:10] for signs for seasons for days and for
[48:16] years and let them be for lights in the
[48:18] firmament of the heaven to give light
[48:20] upon the Earth and it was so and God
[48:24] made two great lights the Great light to
[48:27] Rule the Day and the Lesser night to
[48:29] rule the night and he made the Stars
[48:32] also and God set them in the firmament
[48:34] of the heaven to give light upon the
[48:36] Earth and to rule over the day and over
[48:40] the
[48:41] night and to divide the light from
[48:44] darkness and God saw that it was good
[48:47] you see this word rule I begin to look
[48:49] in this now he gave him rulership over
[48:52] the day and over the night and this word
[48:55] rule means
[48:57] involves the force of exercising power
[49:01] to exercise control or influence to
[49:04] exercise Authority or power to be
[49:07] preeminent or dominant to govern the
[49:10] movements of the
[49:12] things you can be seated this
[49:23] evening now before we get started here
[49:28] grandpa had sent a an email late last
[49:31] night when I was studying and it went so
[49:33] perfectly here so I'm just going to
[49:35] input this in from him and God made the
[49:38] world he might he might have been a 100
[49:42] trillion years making it I don't know
[49:43] how long it was but he made it he didn't
[49:47] say how long it was it's none of our
[49:49] business how long it was that's pretty
[49:52] plain it's none of our business we only
[49:54] believe it amen and he said in the
[49:57] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[49:59] Earth period that settles it and I
[50:02] believe that in it there that everything
[50:04] on Earth reflects the
[50:08] heavens everything on Earth reflects the
[50:10] heavens I believe that because that you
[50:13] see everything struggling for life is
[50:15] because that there is a life that is
[50:17] reflected from and I believe that when
[50:20] God made the man he started reflecting
[50:23] smaller things such as animal life and
[50:25] then the next things he cre created was
[50:27] something different that's exactly the
[50:29] way the Bible says he did he made the
[50:31] first things trees and boty life he made
[50:34] man and then the last thing that ever
[50:36] come up from the earth in the form of
[50:38] creation was man nothing higher ever
[50:43] come because why it was a perfect
[50:47] reflection of the highest in heaven
[50:50] which was
[50:52] God God is a man see God is is a man and
[50:57] so therefore it proves when God came
[50:59] down to dwell amongst us he was man and
[51:02] a man is so in that form that form of
[51:05] perfection of evolution of God which is
[51:08] man amen amen that's something so
[51:12] powerful because the highest form that
[51:14] was ever created from the Earth was
[51:17] man God desired to come down and to be
[51:20] you and I he didn't desire we're going
[51:22] to get into it here he didn't desire to
[51:24] be an angel he said I'm going to go pass
[51:27] the angels and I'm going to drop down to
[51:29] where man dwells because I want to know
[51:32] what you feel I want to know the
[51:34] heartaches I want to know the things you
[51:36] struggle
[51:39] with why would he send you through
[51:41] something that he hasn't already
[51:47] been Paul says in Corinthians for we
[51:51] have borne the image of the
[51:53] Earthly we shall also B bear the image
[51:57] of the
[51:59] Heavenly so this evening I would like to
[52:02] speak on the ministry of the
[52:04] Moon the ministry of the Moon and I was
[52:07] going to put the Lesser light but I you
[52:10] know the ministry of the moon is very
[52:12] Frank it's very forward you should know
[52:14] what the the Moon represents and that is
[52:16] the bride so if you want to put the
[52:17] ministry of the Bride the ministry of
[52:19] the Moon the ministry of yourself
[52:21] whatever it is make sure that's
[52:24] you and as a subject true
[52:27] reflection true reflection so we see
[52:30] here in Genesis 1 and16 that was there
[52:32] was two great lights they had rulership
[52:35] over the day and over the night in
[52:38] Genesis 1 and3 and God said let there be
[52:41] light and there was light so we know
[52:44] that that that was the Vindicated word
[52:46] for that day that if God said let there
[52:49] be light and light didn't come then we
[52:51] would have a
[52:53] problem if God said let there be light
[52:57] and nothing happened it wouldn't be the
[52:59] Vindicated word that's
[53:00] right but yet as God began to speak and
[53:03] now God from the very beginning brother
[53:05] Brandon would begin to tell us that God
[53:07] had nothing to work with but his word he
[53:10] had nothing to work with but his word so
[53:13] as he began to walk through the Earth
[53:15] and he began to speak things begin to
[53:18] happen things begin to come forth us as
[53:20] human beings whenever we get into a
[53:22] place that we want to go build something
[53:24] or let's say this Pulpit was built you
[53:26] can't just speak it you got to go get
[53:28] your tools you got to go get a drill you
[53:30] got to get some screws you got to get
[53:32] all these materialistic things in order
[53:34] to build this
[53:36] Pulpit but God only had his
[53:41] word so from the
[53:43] beginning God only had his word and as
[53:46] it began to speak things begin to take
[53:48] action things begin to take form in
[53:51] Isaiah 55 And1 says so shall my word be
[53:55] that goeth out for forth out of my mouth
[53:57] it shall not return unto me void but it
[54:00] shall accomplish that which I
[54:03] please it shall prosper in the things
[54:06] where unto I send
[54:08] it you see from the very beginning when
[54:11] God began to speak what was it doing it
[54:14] was accomplishing the very thing that it
[54:16] was intended
[54:17] for that's right when he began to speak
[54:20] botney life and he begin to place the
[54:23] planets up in the world and he began to
[54:25] say let there be light and let let there
[54:26] be lights in the firmament Let There Be
[54:28] day and night and he separated the
[54:30] darkness what was he doing what was that
[54:33] word going out for a purpose what was
[54:36] happening it was that Vindicated word
[54:39] and it was going out to accomplish that
[54:41] what it was intended for and it's no
[54:44] different today what is happening
[54:47] tonight as a minister would begin to
[54:50] speak as the word is going forward down
[54:52] Through the Ages as that word is coming
[54:54] into manifestation what is happening the
[54:57] word is being expressed even as it was
[55:00] in the beginning and this Earth your
[55:02] your Earth and vessels this word is
[55:05] going forth and it was forming you it is
[55:08] controlling you is it is making you come
[55:10] into realization of what God is doing by
[55:13] his word what is it doing the word is
[55:15] going forth and it is having an effect
[55:19] amen sir and it is accomplishing that
[55:23] which would it was sent for
[55:27] to them that are in
[55:28] leoda to him that overcometh listen it's
[55:32] just not words on a paper it's not just
[55:34] something written down 2,000 years ago
[55:37] to him that believeth what is it that is
[55:39] a prophecy that is something written
[55:41] down that is a indicated word for this
[55:43] day what is it it's coming into
[55:46] manifestation my
[55:48] goodness
[55:51] sir if you have your Bibles let's turn
[55:53] to Colossians a little lengthy reading
[55:56] but I feel to read this portion of
[56:01] scripture Colossians 1 and
[56:08] verse2 it says give thanks unto the
[56:10] Father which hath made us meet to be
[56:13] partakers of the
[56:15] inheritance of the Saints in light how
[56:18] many's thankful to be partakers of The
[56:21] Inheritance though we only have our
[56:23] Earnest of The Inheritance there's an
[56:25] inheritance is
[56:27] coming and you better make sure that you
[56:29] claim your
[56:30] inheritance who hath delivered us from
[56:33] the power of darkness and ha translated
[56:36] us into the kingdom of his dear son in
[56:39] whom we have Redemption through the his
[56:41] blood even the forgiveness of sin who in
[56:44] the image of the invisible God the
[56:47] firstborn of every creature for by him
[56:51] were all things created that are in
[56:53] heaven and that are in Earth visible and
[56:56] invisible whether they be Thrones and
[56:59] dominions principalities and Powers all
[57:01] things were created by Him and for him
[57:05] listen everything under Heaven and Earth
[57:08] was created by Him and for his glory it
[57:11] don't matter the principalities the
[57:13] powers the the Nations around the world
[57:16] Listen it don't matter who's in office
[57:19] whether it be Cala whether it be Donald
[57:21] Trump listen all this is going going to
[57:24] come to pass the way God wants it to
[57:26] come to
[57:28] pass prophecy is being
[57:32] fulfilled nothing can change it nothing
[57:35] can change the direction of America it's
[57:38] not going to get better it's going to
[57:41] get
[57:42] worse but everything was created by Him
[57:46] and for him and yet when San he came
[57:49] down and Satan wanted to tent him in the
[57:51] desert what was it what did he say all
[57:54] these kingdoms I will give unto you here
[57:57] Satan thought he owned all these
[57:59] kingdoms and he had power over all these
[58:02] kingdoms yet he didn't own one of
[58:05] them it's all according to God's plan
[58:08] and
[58:10] purpose and he is before all things and
[58:13] by him all things
[58:15] consist and you that were sometimes
[58:18] alienated and enemies in your own mind
[58:21] by Wicked Works yet hath he he
[58:25] reconciled
[58:27] you were
[58:28] alienated enemies within what your own
[58:32] mind where is the greatest battle ever
[58:35] fought in the mind your enemy isn't your
[58:38] wife it isn't your husband it isn't your
[58:41] kids the enemy is right here right in
[58:45] your own
[58:47] mind that's where Satan's Battleground
[58:50] is that's where he's going to fight you
[58:51] that's where he's going to try to
[58:52] deceive
[58:53] you that's right
[58:57] in the body of his flesh through death
[58:59] to present you a holy to present you
[59:02] holy and unblamable unreprovable in his
[59:05] sight verse 25 wherefore I made a
[59:08] minister according to the dispensation
[59:10] of God which is given to me for you to
[59:13] fulfill the word of God listen what Paul
[59:15] says even the Mysteries which have been
[59:18] hid from ages and from Generations but
[59:22] now somebody say but now but now is made
[59:25] manifest to his Saints to whom God would
[59:28] make known what the riches of the glory
[59:31] of the Mysteries among the Gentiles
[59:34] which is Christ in you it's not Christ
[59:37] in a pastor it's not Christ in a man or
[59:40] a prophet though there it's there but
[59:42] it's not Christ in somebody else
[59:44] sometimes it's hard to see it's Christ
[59:46] in
[59:47] you it don't matter your age there's no
[59:51] age limit yes it's Christ in you the
[59:54] hope of glory
[59:56] amen whom we preach warning every man
[59:59] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[1:00:02] may present every man perfect in Christ
[1:00:07] Jesus how are you going to get per how
[1:00:10] are you going to get
[1:00:11] Perfection how are you going to achieve
[1:00:14] Perfection though it seems impossible
[1:00:16] what does he say we're going to preach
[1:00:18] unto you and we're going to teach unto
[1:00:20] you why is it so important to come to
[1:00:22] the house of
[1:00:23] God that's it to hear the word of of God
[1:00:26] come and have an effect in our in our
[1:00:29] lives now is the time to correct this is
[1:00:32] a house of judgment a
[1:00:41] correction you see the Paul is dealing
[1:00:43] talking about the G dispensation here
[1:00:46] and we know it's the dispensation of the
[1:00:48] Gentiles but we know that the the
[1:00:50] Gentile dispensation is soon up it's
[1:00:53] blending time we you're seeing
[1:00:56] prophecies being fulfilled we're seeing
[1:00:58] things coming to pass at a rapid Pace
[1:01:01] this world is getting darker and darker
[1:01:03] as the as time goes
[1:01:06] on it's getting worse and worse in this
[1:01:10] dispensation we know is happening and
[1:01:13] it's going to turn from the Gentiles
[1:01:15] back into the Jews what is it brother
[1:01:17] Brandon would talk about the rising of
[1:01:19] the sun and it started in the East and
[1:01:21] then it sets in the west and there's
[1:01:23] only one thing for the sun to do again
[1:01:25] and what is is that go back into the W
[1:01:27] or east
[1:01:30] again he's turning back to them
[1:01:34] Jews Mysteries hidden from ages to ages
[1:01:39] you see as time goes on and we touch
[1:01:41] this in the first the service there but
[1:01:43] I want to resay this is that as we use
[1:01:46] the example of turning off the light and
[1:01:48] we turn it on again and God would send a
[1:01:50] messenger for every
[1:01:52] age but there there was only a lot there
[1:01:56] was only so much of word that he would
[1:01:59] given to that
[1:02:01] messenger so what will those that have
[1:02:04] come down Through the Ages what will
[1:02:06] they be judged by by what they
[1:02:10] know God would be unjust if he began to
[1:02:13] judge the ones that started in the first
[1:02:15] age by the open revealed book that we
[1:02:17] have
[1:02:19] now but as God moved on he began to
[1:02:22] evolve he began to pour out he begin to
[1:02:24] open up he began to show more and give
[1:02:26] more Revelation on more Revelation and
[1:02:28] you begin to understand that they can
[1:02:30] only be judged for what they know so
[1:02:33] whether it be the Reformation of Luther
[1:02:35] and
[1:02:36] justification they could only be judged
[1:02:39] by what they know how much was shown
[1:02:41] unto them and they get unto
[1:02:44] sanctification but yet now we have
[1:02:46] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:02:49] the Holy Ghost now it's coming to our
[1:02:51] day where are we at now what is our
[1:02:55] excuse
[1:02:57] what is our excuse we have 1100 sermons
[1:03:00] of the prophet and he began to open the
[1:03:02] book he began to break the Seven Seals
[1:03:05] he begin to show us this is your day
[1:03:07] this is your
[1:03:09] hour hallelujah what is our excuse what
[1:03:12] will we be judged
[1:03:16] by what will we be judged
[1:03:19] by we'll definitely be judged a whole
[1:03:21] lot
[1:03:24] more because we have the open
[1:03:31] book you see if God can or Satan can get
[1:03:35] you to stop at just justification and
[1:03:38] sanctification if he can get you to stop
[1:03:40] there or even the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:42] Ghost because let me tell you you have
[1:03:44] to go on to the New
[1:03:46] Birth go on and receive the Holy Ghost
[1:03:49] because those that were baptized listen
[1:03:51] baptism is just a outward work of it or
[1:03:54] outward showing of an inward
[1:03:57] work but baptizing it don't change you I
[1:04:01] was 12 years old whenever I got baptized
[1:04:03] I gave my heart I was sincere honest I
[1:04:06] was I gave my heart to
[1:04:08] God but yet as I went through high
[1:04:11] school I wasn't doing things that I
[1:04:13] should have I wasn't living right and
[1:04:16] doing those things that I should have
[1:04:17] that a son or a daughter of God that
[1:04:19] after you get that New Birth you have
[1:04:21] that
[1:04:22] experience let me tell you you don't do
[1:04:25] those things no more more you don't have
[1:04:27] those desires no
[1:04:28] more that's why you must go on with your
[1:04:31] Christian
[1:04:34] walk we all have a Ministry in this
[1:04:37] ministry of the Moon whether it be you
[1:04:39] know many people want to put this
[1:04:41] ministry as just the preachers but this
[1:04:45] ministry goes on for to to so much more
[1:04:49] amen whether it be preachers or song
[1:04:51] leaders musicians maybe somebody an
[1:04:54] elder in the church the the Bible gives
[1:04:56] us us
[1:04:58] instructions to help guide the younger
[1:05:01] ones so whether you be a father a a wife
[1:05:05] a young person no matter who it is we
[1:05:08] all have a Ministry within ourselves we
[1:05:11] all have a part to play listen to what
[1:05:13] brother brandham says here about every
[1:05:17] age he says he that hath an ear let him
[1:05:19] hear what the spirit saith to the
[1:05:21] churches of each age in every age it was
[1:05:24] the same cry hear what the spirit
[1:05:27] says if you are a Christian you will get
[1:05:30] back to what the spirit is teaching
[1:05:32] that's it the word of this age every
[1:05:35] Messenger to every age will preach that
[1:05:37] word every fresh and true Revival will
[1:05:40] be because men have gotten back to the
[1:05:43] word for their age The Cry of every age
[1:05:46] is to rebuke you have left the word of
[1:05:48] God repent and come back to the
[1:05:52] word from the first B book in the Bible
[1:05:56] Genesis to the last book Revelations
[1:05:58] there is only one reason for God's
[1:06:00] displeasure and that is leaving the word
[1:06:04] and there is only one remedy to gain his
[1:06:06] favor there is only one remedy to gain
[1:06:10] his favor and that is to go back to the
[1:06:12] word and so no matter how far you get
[1:06:14] away from the word listen you might be a
[1:06:17] fallen son and you might be sitting at
[1:06:19] home even watching this service I don't
[1:06:21] know who it is but let me tell you get
[1:06:24] back to the word of God
[1:06:26] that's the only remedy who cares what
[1:06:28] everybody else thinks who cares what
[1:06:30] your neighbors will say listen get back
[1:06:32] to your
[1:06:35] position that's the only
[1:06:39] remedy truth get back to the word of
[1:06:43] God in the Ephesian age and in this age
[1:06:47] in every Age We contemplate we'll see
[1:06:49] that is true in the last age which is
[1:06:52] our age we find that the blackout of the
[1:06:55] word the complete apostasy ending in a
[1:06:58] Great Tribulation if you are true seed
[1:07:01] if you are truly baptized with the Holy
[1:07:03] Ghost you will esteem his word above
[1:07:06] your necessary meat and yearn to live by
[1:07:10] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:07:12] mouth of
[1:07:14] God you esteem this before
[1:07:18] anything that's why it's such a priority
[1:07:20] to come to the house of God on a
[1:07:22] Wednesday
[1:07:23] night you should put God first in
[1:07:25] everything that you
[1:07:29] do and yearn to live by everything that
[1:07:32] proceedeth out of the mouth of God what
[1:07:35] is it we've come into an age we have the
[1:07:37] open book we have the revealed word for
[1:07:39] our hour but what happens is people get
[1:07:43] laxed in this this lukewarm age they
[1:07:46] begin to get laxed and they begin to get
[1:07:49] lukewarm and then then you know what
[1:07:50] they begin to do is they begin to take
[1:07:52] parts of the message that they don't
[1:07:54] understand or they don't agree with or
[1:07:56] maybe this doesn't fit my lifestyle and
[1:07:58] they begin to you know what we don't
[1:07:59] need to do that or the prophet didn't
[1:08:01] mean that or the you know let's talk
[1:08:03] about shorts and you know I used to
[1:08:05] battle as a young man with shorts and I
[1:08:06] didn't understand it because you know
[1:08:08] what we begin to do like I said in in
[1:08:10] our own reasoning and understanding we
[1:08:13] begin to say well brother Brandon
[1:08:16] listen
[1:08:18] whenever it was back in your day you
[1:08:20] called it a big Society women's
[1:08:23] undergarments well the shorts were right
[1:08:25] here
[1:08:26] come on brother brandom now they make
[1:08:27] shorts down past my knees what's the
[1:08:30] difference between it past my knees and
[1:08:32] sisters wearing
[1:08:34] skirts you begin to judge and you begin
[1:08:36] to add your own reasoning you begin to
[1:08:38] add your own well well I don't
[1:08:40] understand it no it's that's what he
[1:08:42] said he said kick those things out take
[1:08:45] those things out of your lives am let us
[1:08:49] stick with the word of God
[1:08:53] am to be more dedicated ated to yearn to
[1:08:57] be in church to be more sincere listen
[1:09:00] if the prophet came to his the end of
[1:09:02] his ministry and he said if I need to be
[1:09:05] more sincere and then he be to say and
[1:09:08] then he he he would go on and he would
[1:09:10] talk about man I've I've I've come to
[1:09:13] the end of my Ministry I haven't even
[1:09:14] done anything for Christ what he
[1:09:17] said man how little that makes me feel
[1:09:21] then if a prophet of the age that's
[1:09:24] right if the prophet the age says I can
[1:09:26] be more sincere I can be more dedicated
[1:09:29] to Christ how much more can we as the
[1:09:31] bride of Christ say I can be more
[1:09:36] sincere
[1:09:39] absolutely this isn't a a copy and paste
[1:09:42] message where we just copy and paste
[1:09:44] what we like and what we don't
[1:09:46] like no it's the word of God that's AUM
[1:09:49] thumb them I won't get into it because
[1:09:52] it's it's farther down in my notes but
[1:09:55] back in the Old Testament they would
[1:09:57] have the breastplate of Aaron and that
[1:09:59] was the Aon Thum and if there was a
[1:10:01] prophecy or a prophet that would want to
[1:10:03] come and speak a prophecy or if they had
[1:10:05] a dreamer or whatever it was they would
[1:10:07] have to come and the lights would begin
[1:10:09] to to flicker from the stones if it was
[1:10:12] a true prophecy or not but yet we have
[1:10:14] in this day in irum Thum a tie poost and
[1:10:17] that's the word of God if you have a
[1:10:19] question there's a Bible
[1:10:21] answer take it back to the word of God
[1:10:23] and see what he says amen
[1:10:29] in this
[1:10:30] message as I begin to listen the other
[1:10:33] day and we know that the opening of the
[1:10:36] seals God would begin to reveal these
[1:10:38] great Mysteries to us in this day and he
[1:10:41] would begin to before he would begin to
[1:10:44] preach he was there at brandham
[1:10:45] Tabernacle and he would preach one
[1:10:47] sermon right before the seals God hiding
[1:10:51] himself in
[1:10:52] Simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:10:54] saint yeah I'm so thankful that God he
[1:10:59] comes he comes to the meek he comes to
[1:11:02] the low he comes to those that that are
[1:11:04] not well educated those that may maybe
[1:11:06] don't understand it all but he didn't
[1:11:08] ask you to understand it all he just
[1:11:10] said believe
[1:11:11] it but God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:11:15] and he reveals himself in the same what
[1:11:17] is he doing even tonight the ministry of
[1:11:19] the moon what is he typing Christ and
[1:11:21] his
[1:11:22] bride but he reveals himself
[1:11:25] speaks in
[1:11:27] Simplicity and we see that God when he
[1:11:30] hides himself here that then he be would
[1:11:34] begin to reveal himself in such a simple
[1:11:36] way that people would miss
[1:11:39] him they said they missed him because
[1:11:41] they were looking for him in a certain
[1:11:43] way they they thought he would come some
[1:11:44] other way and yet he come in the way
[1:11:46] that they didn't expect sometimes God
[1:11:49] comes in your life in a way that you
[1:11:50] don't
[1:11:52] expect he might come in a way that you
[1:11:54] least expect
[1:11:56] Ed let me use this example it comes to
[1:11:58] me I was driving the other day and we
[1:12:00] had this homeless man on the side of the
[1:12:05] road and he's walking with a sign and
[1:12:08] he's coming and he's approaching me and
[1:12:10] his sign says
[1:12:11] hungry well I just bought a a brand new
[1:12:14] small bag of chips in the in the the gas
[1:12:18] station there so I roll down my window
[1:12:21] and he's coming my way and I reach out
[1:12:22] to hand it to him and he says no thank
[1:12:25] you I'm
[1:12:28] good your sign says
[1:12:31] hungry I just give you
[1:12:36] food but yet sometimes that's what
[1:12:40] happens God is trying to give you
[1:12:42] something and you're asking you say God
[1:12:45] I have a need I want you to answer the
[1:12:47] prayer this way Lord would you come by
[1:12:48] my way would you Minister and yet God
[1:12:50] comes by in a simple way and he says
[1:12:53] here you go son and you say
[1:12:55] I'm
[1:12:59] good my
[1:13:00] goodness I say God help us I want all
[1:13:04] that he has for me I want everything God
[1:13:06] if it's if it fits my life is if
[1:13:09] something that that I don't see coming
[1:13:11] whatever it may be sometimes he sends a
[1:13:13] trial my way and I don't understand it
[1:13:15] but I say God if this is your will I
[1:13:17] want to be in your perfect will I would
[1:13:21] rather be in his perfect will than my
[1:13:23] permissive will
[1:13:28] yes the ministry of the Moon we know
[1:13:30] that brother bradam would be a
[1:13:32] typologist and he would begin to type
[1:13:35] things in his Bible he would say I
[1:13:37] didn't go to school to learn this but
[1:13:39] then he be he would show you throughout
[1:13:40] his whole Ministry he would show you
[1:13:42] types and shadows and we know that God's
[1:13:44] first Bible was written in the heavens
[1:13:46] the Zodiac and as God began to place
[1:13:49] things there he would place the the the
[1:13:51] Leo the Lion and he would place the the
[1:13:54] great Galaxy the Milky Way and he would
[1:13:56] place this planet here and this planet
[1:13:58] there and and Jupiter over here and as
[1:14:00] he began to place there was a reason for
[1:14:02] his positioning and
[1:14:07] placing they were all placed for a
[1:14:10] certain purpose and yet within just the
[1:14:14] the the the the Galaxy alone but we know
[1:14:16] in earth as we'll read here that there's
[1:14:18] diversities and
[1:14:20] differences and yet as we read what is
[1:14:23] reflected in heaven or what is reflected
[1:14:25] in Earth is reflected in heaven so let's
[1:14:28] turn to 1 Corinthians
[1:14:33] 15 1 Corinthians 15 and 3 uh8 says but
[1:14:38] God
[1:14:39] giveth it a body as it it pleth him to
[1:14:43] every seed his own body All Flesh is not
[1:14:46] the same flesh but there is one kind of
[1:14:49] Flesh of men another flesh of Beast
[1:14:52] another flesh of fish another flesh of
[1:14:55] of
[1:14:56] birds and there are also celestial
[1:14:58] bodies and bodies in the terrestrial but
[1:15:01] the glory of the celestial is one and
[1:15:03] the glory of the terrestrial is another
[1:15:06] now he's talking about the resurrection
[1:15:07] of the body here in this portion of
[1:15:09] scripture and we jumped right in the
[1:15:10] middle of it but I thought this was so
[1:15:13] profound that he's trying to say
[1:15:14] something here because he says there is
[1:15:16] one glory of the Sun and another glory
[1:15:19] of the Moon and another Glory of stars
[1:15:23] plural and one star differ from another
[1:15:26] star in glory so there's one glory of
[1:15:30] the Sun and one glory of the moon but
[1:15:32] there's many stars that are up
[1:15:37] there and we know that in Genesis 1 and6
[1:15:41] that he made two great lights the
[1:15:43] greater light to Rule the Day and the
[1:15:45] Lesser night to rule the
[1:15:46] night and he made Stars also so we see
[1:15:50] here that one star differeth one from
[1:15:52] another now I had to take take a just a
[1:15:56] side note because I begin to as I begin
[1:15:58] to look into this where do where does
[1:16:00] the sunlight where does the sunlight
[1:16:02] there well where does the Moonlight
[1:16:04] begin to get its sunlight we know that
[1:16:07] but I begin to look and I begin to see
[1:16:09] where does the stars get their
[1:16:11] light where do stars get their light
[1:16:15] stars produce their own light and an
[1:16:18] energy by a process called nuclear
[1:16:22] fusion you see that's why there's
[1:16:24] differences amongst them because they
[1:16:26] don't all have the same light
[1:16:29] source you see the Moon gets its light
[1:16:32] from the sun it has no glory within
[1:16:35] itself it has no light to give itself
[1:16:37] but it is a reflection of the
[1:16:42] Sun the thing about stars listen we're
[1:16:45] going to talk naturally here the thing
[1:16:47] about stars we see it all over our
[1:16:49] universe all over our world but
[1:16:52] Naturally Speaking we see stars in The
[1:16:55] Sports World we see SP stars in in
[1:16:59] concerts and we see Rising Stars over
[1:17:02] here and you get an athlete and you you
[1:17:04] got these Olympic Games going on and you
[1:17:05] see this young man that can run so fast
[1:17:08] and he can break world records and he
[1:17:10] becomes a
[1:17:11] star but yet just as fast as that star
[1:17:15] Rises it's going to
[1:17:18] fall it begins to
[1:17:20] fall and these stars begin to have Glory
[1:17:24] within them elves they begin to want to
[1:17:27] sh outshine one
[1:17:32] another out there they praise him I
[1:17:35] trust it's not in here but out there in
[1:17:37] the world they praise him for what they
[1:17:39] can do on the field oh they can jump
[1:17:42] fast they can throw the ball hard listen
[1:17:44] I was I'm a sports fan and if you
[1:17:47] idolize these men as there's something
[1:17:49] let me tell you they have nothing to do
[1:17:51] with your life their life does not
[1:17:53] affect you one way or the the other
[1:17:55] whether your team wins the World Series
[1:17:57] or not nothing affects you that
[1:18:00] shouldn't affect you that shouldn't
[1:18:02] determine the way you live or what you
[1:18:04] idolize or the way you dress you
[1:18:06] shouldn't look to those natural
[1:18:09] stars but we see that these Stars put
[1:18:12] out their lights and we worship these
[1:18:15] stars there in Hollywood and we would
[1:18:17] call them Hollywood
[1:18:19] stars for what they can
[1:18:22] do but yet let me ask you something
[1:18:25] would you want to have their home
[1:18:28] life would you want to live where they
[1:18:30] do would you want to have the the
[1:18:32] alcohol problems and the drug problems
[1:18:35] and being married two and three times
[1:18:37] and being in depression and having
[1:18:39] anxiety listen they think that's
[1:18:42] living and that's what Satan has to
[1:18:45] offer his
[1:18:47] Stars we're going to get into it Satan
[1:18:50] pulled Stars away in the beginning and
[1:18:54] is doing the same
[1:18:59] tonight these stars are a form of
[1:19:02] influence both good and
[1:19:04] evil and they want to outshine one
[1:19:06] another but if we aren't careful and
[1:19:09] he'll creep into the message and you
[1:19:11] become a star and you want to project
[1:19:13] your own light you want to project one
[1:19:15] you know you want to be outshine one
[1:19:17] another that shouldn't be the mentality
[1:19:19] that we have in the message because
[1:19:21] we're not here to reflect listen we're
[1:19:23] not to here to shine our own light but
[1:19:25] we're here to reflect the
[1:19:28] Sun and to be the ministry of the
[1:19:34] moon so we see
[1:19:37] here that within stars in the beginning
[1:19:40] is where Lucifer began to do his work
[1:19:44] you see God's first attribute when he
[1:19:46] said let there be
[1:19:49] light light came
[1:19:51] forth Lucifer is the bringer of light
[1:19:56] God's first attribute Lucifer came
[1:20:00] forth and you say how is that so brother
[1:20:03] brandham says that Lucifer was God's
[1:20:06] right-hand
[1:20:07] man in the beginning so we see that this
[1:20:10] attribute came forth and Lucifer the
[1:20:14] definition of Lucifer means bearer of
[1:20:16] light or Morning Star it refers to his
[1:20:19] former Splendor as the greatest of the
[1:20:22] Angels his former splend spend yeah his
[1:20:26] former Splendor
[1:20:29] right and as I begin to look into this
[1:20:32] it popped up on Wikipedia so you can
[1:20:34] believe it if you don't that's
[1:20:37] okay but Wikipedia pulled it up and I
[1:20:40] was just and this definition or th this
[1:20:43] uh uh this this yeah this definition or
[1:20:45] meaning just spoke to me and it was in a
[1:20:48] way it says the tradition
[1:20:50] usually reverts as Lucifer not as a
[1:20:53] devil not as the devil listen how subtle
[1:20:56] this is how soft it makes it sound a
[1:21:00] little bit
[1:21:02] nicer but a destroyer a guardian a
[1:21:06] liberator a lightbringer or a guiding
[1:21:09] Spirit to
[1:21:11] Darkness a guiding Spirit to Darkness
[1:21:14] you see if you say oh that's a devil or
[1:21:16] that's it might prick somebody else's
[1:21:19] well that's a devil but that's a little
[1:21:20] too hard let's call him a liberator you
[1:21:24] know what he's trying trying to do he's
[1:21:25] trying to offer you
[1:21:28] Liberation he's trying to give you that
[1:21:32] freedom and yet he's a guiding Spirit to
[1:21:37] Darkness you see he's a deceiver and a
[1:21:41] liar there's nothing he has to offer he
[1:21:44] has nothing to offer you what is his end
[1:21:47] goal for
[1:21:48] you what is his end goal after he offers
[1:21:51] you the world and he gives you and he
[1:21:53] makes you a star and you can be the
[1:21:55] greatest you can be a Instagram
[1:21:58] sensation right you have all kinds of
[1:22:00] stars rising up they have you know you
[1:22:03] can do a a 15 second interview and you
[1:22:06] can be become a star and have interviews
[1:22:07] all around the
[1:22:09] world and what is Satan using he's using
[1:22:13] that to influence your
[1:22:17] mind he's trying to get to you through
[1:22:20] that
[1:22:21] Gateway but yet we see what is his end
[1:22:23] goal after all that he has to offer
[1:22:27] after this life what does he have to
[1:22:29] give nothing yeah
[1:22:33] nothing Isaiah 14 and12 says how Thou
[1:22:37] Art Fallen fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer
[1:22:39] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[1:22:42] to the ground which did US weaken the
[1:22:45] Nations for thou has said in thy heart I
[1:22:48] will a sin listen he didn't speak it out
[1:22:50] loud he said it in his heart God God is
[1:22:54] a discerner of the heart amen I will
[1:22:58] Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[1:23:01] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[1:23:03] upon the the Mount of the congregation
[1:23:06] in the sides of the north I will Ascend
[1:23:09] above the heights of the clouds I will
[1:23:11] be like the most high and boy are we
[1:23:15] living in a generation where it's all
[1:23:16] about I and everybody has their
[1:23:21] rights you see the reason I'm giving you
[1:23:24] this definition of Lucifer because I
[1:23:26] want you to understand who he is brother
[1:23:28] brandom says you better know who your
[1:23:30] enemy is you better know his tactics
[1:23:33] because when he comes in and he tries to
[1:23:35] be a liberator and he wants to give you
[1:23:37] Freedom you better identify what Freedom
[1:23:39] he's trying to give
[1:23:47] you he's a bearer of false light
[1:23:50] perverting that very true light in the
[1:23:53] beginning and and so here I want to
[1:23:56] establish a few of the things that I've
[1:23:58] said by the
[1:24:00] prophet the God of this evil age 65 he
[1:24:03] says it was Satan's ambition to be
[1:24:05] worshiped like God he took 2third twoth
[1:24:07] thirds of the stars of heaven and
[1:24:10] ascended himself above the stars and he
[1:24:12] preached to them how are people being
[1:24:14] deceived how are people being even
[1:24:16] deceived within the message they're
[1:24:18] being preached
[1:24:21] to and deceive 2third of them you'll see
[1:24:25] and notice that was his ambition the
[1:24:28] Seal of the Antichrist he says did you
[1:24:30] know that in heaven that the devil was
[1:24:32] God's right-hand man in the beginning
[1:24:34] that Lucifer the son of the morning was
[1:24:36] given power and the reason that he
[1:24:39] brought sin into the world he was able
[1:24:41] to take something that God had created
[1:24:44] and pervert it back into an evil thing
[1:24:46] which started all this trouble in in the
[1:24:50] beginning then God back before the
[1:24:53] foundation of the world was ever laid
[1:24:55] listen before the foundation was ever
[1:24:58] laid when God had seen what Satan had
[1:25:02] done in his pride went over in the north
[1:25:05] and set up a kingdom and fought against
[1:25:08] Michael and his angels He says the right
[1:25:11] hand man of almighty God was Lucifer the
[1:25:15] son of the morning the first God granted
[1:25:17] him almost co-workers with him he was a
[1:25:20] coworker partly equal
[1:25:24] partly
[1:25:25] equal I remember brother Mario preaching
[1:25:28] a sermon or in it he said you are
[1:25:31] co-workers with God you are co-workers
[1:25:35] with God and yet from the very beginning
[1:25:38] Satan Lucifer the one that was that was
[1:25:41] so close to God was a part coworker with
[1:25:45] god listen how close it is the deception
[1:25:50] that is coming down in our day do you
[1:25:52] understand things out there aren't going
[1:25:53] to deceive you if you believe this
[1:25:54] message is true things way out there
[1:25:57] aren't going to deceive you but it's
[1:25:58] going to be things very close He's a
[1:26:01] Part cooworker
[1:26:06] partly equal with him and listen he says
[1:26:10] partly equal with him but I'm so glad to
[1:26:12] a son and daughter of God the Bible says
[1:26:14] think it not robbery to be equal with
[1:26:17] God that's your right and that's my
[1:26:20] right
[1:26:22] tonight not part ly not partial amen but
[1:26:26] equal with
[1:26:31] God only Satan could not create God is
[1:26:34] the only Creator but Satan took
[1:26:36] something that God created and perverted
[1:26:38] it back into something else that was
[1:26:40] evil one more quote here he
[1:26:43] says if you notice Lucifer is doing the
[1:26:47] exact same thing tonight that he did in
[1:26:50] the beginning Lucifer at the beginning
[1:26:52] wanted to build himself a kingdom which
[1:26:54] is greater and more beautiful than
[1:26:56] Michael's Kingdom Christ and he that was
[1:27:00] that was his ambition to achieve
[1:27:01] something like that and what did he get
[1:27:04] to do get to do it by he took Fallen
[1:27:09] Angels Fallen Angels who had lost their
[1:27:12] first estate he took that to do with it
[1:27:16] do it with let's skip down to save time
[1:27:18] he says what is it he's doing it with
[1:27:21] Fallen Angels Fallen Lucifers Fallen
[1:27:23] meth is Fallen Pentecostals that lost
[1:27:26] their original estate from the word of
[1:27:28] God and going right back into make some
[1:27:31] Big E commical move Fallen Messengers
[1:27:34] listen Fallen Messengers who once stayed
[1:27:38] with the word but sold out their birth
[1:27:40] right to join into the world Listen
[1:27:42] we're not just talking this was brother
[1:27:44] branham's day that he would go to to the
[1:27:46] Luthers and he would go to the
[1:27:48] Pentecostals and he would go and preach
[1:27:50] to all these different ones because
[1:27:51] there was no message churches there was
[1:27:53] very few but how far have we come bring
[1:27:57] it to right now fallen Messengers Fallen
[1:28:01] message people fallen message preachers
[1:28:04] that have walked away left their birth
[1:28:06] rate walked away from the word of
[1:28:09] God trying to deceive the
[1:28:15] people fallen Messengers who once stayed
[1:28:18] with the word but sold out for their
[1:28:20] Birthright he says that the same a same
[1:28:23] thing is in this last day and Lucifer is
[1:28:26] achieving it today by man whose Spirits
[1:28:29] in them that he did with the angels at
[1:28:32] the beginning Fallen Angels who kept not
[1:28:35] their first estate to obey God and he's
[1:28:38] doing the same thing today why is this
[1:28:42] deception so close it could deceive the
[1:28:45] very elected if it was possible he has
[1:28:49] to bring something so
[1:28:51] fine but let me tell you something
[1:28:55] my Revelation my understanding of this
[1:28:57] message is not based upon some man if
[1:29:00] some man in this message begins to fall
[1:29:02] away and he begins to preach some
[1:29:04] something way out there listen I ain't
[1:29:06] focused on on the make belief people
[1:29:08] don't study when you study the real
[1:29:10] dollar bill when you study that dollar
[1:29:13] bill you'll know a fake one when it
[1:29:15] comes across your path I don't need to
[1:29:18] get caught up in all the nonsense out
[1:29:20] there and if you get caught up in the
[1:29:21] nonsense listen there might be one that
[1:29:23] comes against you but there's another
[1:29:25] hundred more waiting for you and it's
[1:29:27] not a time to wait upon those fake
[1:29:30] dollar bills forget those guys let us
[1:29:33] focus on the goal that lays
[1:29:35] ahead I want to press into the mark that
[1:29:38] lays before me I want to take care of my
[1:29:40] life and my family's life I want to make
[1:29:42] sure that my home is in a position to
[1:29:45] make the Rapture I'm not worried about
[1:29:47] other families I'm not worried about
[1:29:49] other
[1:29:53] churches amen because if everybody makes
[1:29:56] sure that your calling an election is
[1:29:59] sure listen when you get in the ball
[1:30:01] game brother Ron said it many a times
[1:30:04] when you get in the game listen it don't
[1:30:06] matter if I'm the running back and
[1:30:07] you're the lineman there's not a glow
[1:30:09] there isn't glory in be linemen they're
[1:30:12] in the they're in the trenches but let
[1:30:14] me tell you something when you score a
[1:30:16] touchdown it's for the whole
[1:30:18] team and now is the time now is the time
[1:30:22] now is your ministry to play your part I
[1:30:24] don't care who you are what position you
[1:30:27] play just get in the
[1:30:29] game play your
[1:30:31] position because let me say this if you
[1:30:33] don't if your ministry if your ministry
[1:30:36] is not being shared if you're not living
[1:30:38] the life that you should you know what
[1:30:40] happens it affects everybody that's
[1:30:41] under
[1:30:43] you if you're a husband and you're not
[1:30:45] priorities are not in place what happens
[1:30:48] all the family begins to
[1:30:50] slip if you're a wife and you're not
[1:30:52] doing the duties and fulfilling those
[1:30:54] duties what
[1:30:56] happens everybody under you begins to
[1:30:59] feel the effect of that yes sir that's
[1:31:01] right that's why it's important that
[1:31:03] each one of us holds our
[1:31:05] ministry you don't have to preach the
[1:31:07] gospel live the life of
[1:31:14] Christ Isaiah 5 and 20 says woe unto
[1:31:18] them that call evil good and good evil
[1:31:21] that put Darkness for light and light
[1:31:23] for dark darkness that put bitter for
[1:31:25] sweet and Sweet for bitter woe unto them
[1:31:28] that are wise in their own
[1:31:31] eyes impr it in their own sides but I'm
[1:31:35] so thankful that's not you and
[1:31:37] I listen we don't choose Darkness over
[1:31:40] light we're here to choose light over
[1:31:43] Darkness we're here to choose the word
[1:31:44] of God in our
[1:31:46] day I don't want to be some star listen
[1:31:50] to me I don't want to be some star
[1:31:52] trying to share my own Ministry his or
[1:31:54] shine my own light that's not what we're
[1:31:56] called to Saints and if you're trying to
[1:31:58] compete and you're trying to share one
[1:32:00] this this gift and that gift and you're
[1:32:02] trying to compete your light and I'm a
[1:32:04] better singer and this no no no that's
[1:32:06] nonsense stop trying to be a light
[1:32:08] amongst
[1:32:10] yourselves be the moon shine his
[1:32:17] light we know that
[1:32:20] Darkness Darkness it would as Darkness
[1:32:24] would creep in Andross Darkness the
[1:32:26] people Darkness would dull some
[1:32:29] senses as I did in the beginning of the
[1:32:32] last service that you would turn off the
[1:32:34] light it would it would it would dull
[1:32:37] your your your line of sight it would
[1:32:39] hinder that perception maybe you
[1:32:41] wouldn't be able to hear where the sound
[1:32:43] is coming from my son Nolan when we're
[1:32:46] laying in bed and something happen
[1:32:47] what's that
[1:32:48] noise what's that
[1:32:52] noise and you see that
[1:32:54] it it would dull our senses we wouldn't
[1:32:57] have a a perception on certain things
[1:33:00] but also Darkness what it'll do is it
[1:33:02] will en heighten or
[1:33:05] heighten that of your imagination it
[1:33:08] would begin to mess with the the the the
[1:33:10] gates of the Soul imagination reasoning
[1:33:13] all those different ones it would begin
[1:33:16] to play a part if we were to turn off
[1:33:18] the light and you would feel this th
[1:33:21] this fear come over yet you know where
[1:33:23] you sit you know where the exit is but
[1:33:26] yet it still causes something in our own
[1:33:29] human minds and we begin to imagine
[1:33:32] certain things we begin to imagine even
[1:33:34] noan laying in bed and he would look
[1:33:36] across the room and it's a plant but
[1:33:38] when you turn off the light it's it's a
[1:33:40] palm leaf that hangs over the window
[1:33:42] there a little bit and he would say hey
[1:33:43] that's a lizard tail like would an
[1:33:46] imagination know that's not yes it is no
[1:33:49] it's not son you turn on the light it
[1:33:51] reveals it it reveals what it is you see
[1:33:55] what that light does the light of the
[1:33:57] word of God it's a
[1:34:00] revealer it shows things in
[1:34:03] darkness amen but we know that here that
[1:34:06] that there's those five gates to the
[1:34:07] soul imagination reasoning conscience
[1:34:10] all those ones and Satan would begin to
[1:34:12] mess with your mind he would try to
[1:34:14] bring you into a place of
[1:34:17] Darkness but yet we know that as a
[1:34:20] believer in Christ that we have a sick
[1:34:23] sense
[1:34:24] that God has given us a six sense not to
[1:34:26] go by our five senses of SE taste smell
[1:34:29] here we don't go by those senses why
[1:34:33] because as Darkness begins to surround
[1:34:35] us listen it might Dole the other senses
[1:34:38] but it doesn't doll or weaken our six
[1:34:41] sense because that six sense is our
[1:34:43] faith in the word of God it is that
[1:34:45] faith in in the light of the hour and so
[1:34:48] when God be he comes and he gives you
[1:34:50] that six sense listen no matter how dark
[1:34:53] it gets no matter how dark it gets out
[1:34:55] there listen you have that six sense
[1:34:58] hold on to that six
[1:35:03] sense because though we don't feel it
[1:35:06] though we don't understand it though we
[1:35:08] don't see God working he's still working
[1:35:10] in our lives my
[1:35:14] goodness let me hurry
[1:35:18] here in Lucifer we
[1:35:20] see that as he have
[1:35:24] he had deceived the stars in the
[1:35:26] beginning and led them
[1:35:30] away let me skip some of
[1:35:37] this you are
[1:35:39] not called to shine your own light let's
[1:35:41] see here let's show the picture I want
[1:35:43] to talk about the the phases because I
[1:35:45] want to get through this the phases of
[1:35:47] the sun because I'm going to go into
[1:35:48] something and this was my main thought
[1:35:50] for the
[1:35:51] tonight I begin to look up the the
[1:35:53] phases of the
[1:35:55] Sun and as we see here though it might
[1:35:58] be small we see that to the left is a
[1:36:01] cycle of the sun it is the birth but
[1:36:03] underneath it you might see and it says
[1:36:05] in billions of years so 1 to 14 in
[1:36:08] billions of
[1:36:10] years so what you're telling me is that
[1:36:13] the sun doesn't change very
[1:36:16] often if it changes every so many
[1:36:18] billions of years the change the sun is
[1:36:22] consistent it is stable it rises every
[1:36:25] day it comes up in the East and it sets
[1:36:27] in the west you can count on the sun to
[1:36:33] rise it's Dependable it's
[1:36:36] reliable does that sound
[1:36:39] familiar does that sound familiar just
[1:36:42] as not only the sun types this but not
[1:36:45] only the Su in but the s o in he's
[1:36:47] Dependable he's reliable he's unchanging
[1:36:50] he says I am God and I change
[1:36:52] not I am the same yesterday today and
[1:36:57] forever but I want you to let's get over
[1:36:59] to the next picture I want you to notice
[1:37:01] the difference of being in the position
[1:37:05] of the
[1:37:07] Moon the position of the Moon the Moon
[1:37:09] goes through
[1:37:11] phases the moon goes through stages in
[1:37:14] its life and it's a cycle of
[1:37:20] Life wouldn't it been easier if God made
[1:37:23] us the
[1:37:24] sun wouldn't life be so much
[1:37:27] better that if God Made You the Sun and
[1:37:29] life was consistent you didn't have to
[1:37:31] worry about anything no trials nothing
[1:37:35] everything every day it was the same
[1:37:39] consistency but the moon you see here
[1:37:41] goes through seven
[1:37:43] phases to make the new Sun the new moon
[1:37:46] again it goes through Cycles how many
[1:37:49] can relate to this Moon here in their
[1:37:52] lives you go through through phases you
[1:37:55] go through times in your life you go
[1:37:58] through
[1:37:59] situations you go through
[1:38:01] trials one minute you're shining like
[1:38:04] the full moon and you're on fire for God
[1:38:06] and you haven't had a trial in a while
[1:38:08] and you're serving God and you're
[1:38:09] amening then all of a sudden phases
[1:38:13] happen you begin to shine a little bit
[1:38:17] half and then all of a sudden it gets to
[1:38:19] a
[1:38:20] Crest and there's a small Li sliver of
[1:38:23] light
[1:38:24] but let me tell you something just
[1:38:26] because it's a small sliver doesn't mean
[1:38:28] she's lost her
[1:38:29] position doesn't mean there's any
[1:38:31] there's no lesser Light Within her she
[1:38:33] hasn't lost her
[1:38:36] position I want to encourage you that
[1:38:39] just because you have that small liver
[1:38:41] sliver of light maybe it's a trial maybe
[1:38:43] it's a sickness maybe it's something
[1:38:45] you're going through in a phase of
[1:38:47] life do you know why the moon has
[1:38:51] phases because it is the cycle
[1:38:54] and as the sun rotates what it begins to
[1:38:56] do what is God doing with the moon it's
[1:38:59] changing her
[1:39:01] position it begins to shine on different
[1:39:03] parts of that Moon it doesn't shine just
[1:39:06] on one part but maybe God needs to work
[1:39:08] on a different side of you maybe he
[1:39:10] needs to work on this side of you and he
[1:39:12] wants you to reflect a different side
[1:39:14] what is God doing he's changing your
[1:39:16] position and that's what he's done all
[1:39:18] down Through the Ages brother brandom we
[1:39:20] would see in the next picture that he
[1:39:22] would use this in the seven Church ages
[1:39:24] and he would refer that as the moon the
[1:39:27] cycle the phases of the moon here and we
[1:39:29] would see that in uh Ephesian in Paul's
[1:39:32] day it was a great
[1:39:34] light it was a great light and then as
[1:39:38] time would go on it would become a
[1:39:40] decreasing light and then you have the
[1:39:42] Dark Ages there and a darker age in the
[1:39:44] climax in Columba and then you would see
[1:39:47] the Reformation would
[1:39:49] begin and the Reformation continues into
[1:39:52] Lutheran
[1:39:55] what is it it's the cycle of the
[1:39:58] moon but yet just as there was seven
[1:40:00] phases a new moon is coming a new moon
[1:40:04] is coming let me tell you God your new
[1:40:07] moon is coming you might be in this
[1:40:09] cycle but a new moon is coming God isn't
[1:40:12] didn't send this message to reform he
[1:40:14] didn't send it just to to bring you to
[1:40:16] justification and sanctification what is
[1:40:19] this message sent for it is a
[1:40:21] restoration message it is is to restore
[1:40:24] us back to A New
[1:40:30] Beginning you see
[1:40:32] if the prophet would
[1:40:36] say that he couldn't see anything past
[1:40:39] you can take it down Brothers if you
[1:40:41] could see the prophet would say back in
[1:40:44] back in I don't even remember when he
[1:40:46] said it but back and he was talking
[1:40:48] about that that Darkness was so gross
[1:40:51] upon the people that he couldn't see
[1:40:53] past 1977 and here we are in
[1:40:56] 2024 where are we 47 years passing how
[1:41:02] dark is this age where are we at in
[1:41:04] God's
[1:41:08] timeline I'm going to bring this to the
[1:41:11] a close musicians
[1:41:15] come brother brandham would say in a
[1:41:17] paradox he says it's a paradox when you
[1:41:19] watch the
[1:41:21] Moon look at the Tides go out on the
[1:41:25] coast and on Angry the waves with about
[1:41:29] four fifths of the earth almost in water
[1:41:31] go out to the seashore and watch that
[1:41:34] tide come in as those angry big waves
[1:41:36] breaking way out there half a mile out
[1:41:38] in the ocean or more beating against the
[1:41:41] ocean Bank why does it why does it come
[1:41:43] O why doesn't it come over he says
[1:41:45] there's just one thing keeping it from
[1:41:48] doing so that's the
[1:41:50] moon that's the moon he said God's watch
[1:41:54] doong he watches over the seashore
[1:41:57] because God has set its boundaries and
[1:41:59] it cannot pass
[1:42:05] that but when that Moon begins to turn
[1:42:07] around and look at father notice that
[1:42:09] tide will slip
[1:42:11] in then when it turns back it takes its
[1:42:15] place again it has you because it's
[1:42:17] God's
[1:42:19] Watchdog that Moon millions of miles
[1:42:22] away from Earth
[1:42:23] how can it affect the Earth how can it
[1:42:26] draw a
[1:42:27] line why don't the sea run in a few
[1:42:30] hundred miles and then stop because so
[1:42:33] God set its boundaries and he cannot
[1:42:35] pass
[1:42:36] that he's got a Watchman to see that it
[1:42:38] doesn't pass
[1:42:54] he's got a
[1:42:58] watchdog you he in the absence of the
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:04] son he's got somebody
[1:43:08] watching he's got somebody reflecting
[1:43:11] his own
[1:43:13] light what a great responsibility we
[1:43:17] have what if their Watchman what if the
[1:43:20] Watch Dog
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:25] what if that Watchdog doesn't keep its
[1:43:33] job what
[1:43:36] happens if you have a watchdog and he's
[1:43:38] watching your
[1:43:42] [Music]
[1:43:44] house somebody would come along and he
[1:43:47] would give him a treat he would just
[1:43:49] slip on something
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:53] and then the next time he comes he slips
[1:43:55] something
[1:43:56] else pretty soon that watchdog's let
[1:43:59] down his guard
[1:44:02] sir he's let down his
[1:44:08] guard and that Watchman that
[1:44:14] Watchdog when he lets down his guard he
[1:44:16] lets down his
[1:44:18] boundaries he begins to let things
[1:44:20] happen that Watchdog That was supposed
[1:44:22] to watch over the heads of the house
[1:44:24] over the family in the
[1:44:27] home that Watchdog lets lets the guard
[1:44:30] down now he doesn't bark at the the
[1:44:33] thief that's coming up and that's what
[1:44:36] Satan's going to do he's going to try to
[1:44:39] slip something to
[1:44:40] you he's going to try to throw you
[1:44:43] something say it's okay you can allow
[1:44:46] that you can do
[1:44:50] that we are all made watch talk
[1:44:55] Watchmen brother Brandon would preach a
[1:44:57] sermon Watchman what of the
[1:45:05] night God has placed the moon here for a
[1:45:11] boundary because when Satan comes in
[1:45:14] like a flood what does he
[1:45:17] say I'm going to hold up a
[1:45:19] standard who is that standard yeah
[1:45:23] who is that watch who is those Watch
[1:45:38] Dog what a great responsibility it
[1:45:42] is for us fathers
[1:45:45] mothers we each have a
[1:45:47] Ministry that we don't let in the guard
[1:45:50] we don't let down the guard because if
[1:45:51] we let down the guard in one area listen
[1:45:54] if the moon doesn't hold her
[1:45:56] position if the moon doesn't hold her
[1:45:59] place what is the moon also there for
[1:46:01] for a gravitational it it evolves around
[1:46:04] an axis that if we take the Moon away
[1:46:06] this world would spin out of
[1:46:10] orament but the Moon is put there for a
[1:46:16] stabilization you are what stabilizes
[1:46:18] this world you're the only thing keeping
[1:46:21] this world together you know that he
[1:46:23] says I have an elect lady down there I
[1:46:26] have elect
[1:46:27] seedl and until that LE until that last
[1:46:31] elect seed comes into his
[1:46:34] position you were the Watchdog you are
[1:46:36] the Watchman don't let the boundary
[1:46:40] go because if we let the boundary go
[1:46:43] everybody in Earth the the
[1:46:46] seashore Naturally Speaking if the waves
[1:46:49] come and they beat and they beat and it
[1:46:51] beat and it seems like sometimes we're
[1:46:53] in a battle and it keeps coming and
[1:46:55] keeps coming like
[1:46:58] waves but yet if one of us begins to let
[1:47:01] down the bar if we begin to let slip
[1:47:03] along the seashore what happens the
[1:47:05] ocean just going to open
[1:47:09] up how important is our
[1:47:12] ministry Watchmen what of the night what
[1:47:16] is that true church
[1:47:18] ministry the ministry of that church
[1:47:20] will be the ministry of the son
[1:47:23] because it's a reflection of the same
[1:47:25] sun power the same
[1:47:29] sunlight that world will know when the
[1:47:32] Sun
[1:47:33] rises what it'll look like why will it
[1:47:37] know what it looks like because it's the
[1:47:39] same
[1:47:40] sunlight there's nothing
[1:47:42] different there should be nothing
[1:47:44] between the light that you reflect than
[1:47:47] the light the Vindicated word that was
[1:47:50] spoken people shouldn't be able to tell
[1:47:52] a difference they should be say that's
[1:47:55] God right
[1:47:57] there that's a Son of God that's a
[1:47:59] daughter of God why because your life
[1:48:01] speaks
[1:48:04] volumes let's
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:10] stand my
[1:48:15] goodness let's just bow our heads and
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:23] you know as I was studying
[1:48:25] and I don't believe that there's
[1:48:29] coincidence I believe that sometimes as
[1:48:31] you study and you come across something
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:38] and God just begin to speak to my heart
[1:48:41] and I'm going to read this here we know
[1:48:44] the story many of
[1:48:49] you but Danny
[1:48:51] Greenfield where the Randon would tell
[1:48:53] this story that Danny
[1:48:55] Greenfield he was a
[1:49:00] preacher and Danny Greenfield he he
[1:49:02] would have a
[1:49:05] dream and on this night he had a dream
[1:49:07] and he thought that he had died and went
[1:49:09] up to heaven and he came up to the gates
[1:49:11] and the gate keeper keeper came and said
[1:49:15] who approaches this
[1:49:18] place he said I'm Danny Greenfield the
[1:49:20] Evangelist from America and he says just
[1:49:22] a moment Mr
[1:49:25] Greenfield I'll see if I can let you in
[1:49:27] if your name's on the book all
[1:49:31] right he looked the book over and he
[1:49:34] came back and said sir I'm sorry but
[1:49:37] your name is not on the
[1:49:39] book you must
[1:49:42] depart he said oh he said surely you're
[1:49:45] you're wrong I preached the gospel I I
[1:49:48] lived a good life said surely my name is
[1:49:50] on the book Saidi sorry he said he said
[1:49:53] it's not here he said what shall I do
[1:49:57] then he says you might have to appeal
[1:49:59] your case at White Throne
[1:50:03] judgment he says I have no choice well
[1:50:06] that's what I must
[1:50:09] do and he said he seemed like he began
[1:50:12] to move through the air like a at a
[1:50:15] traffic speed and he came into the
[1:50:17] presence of a light and as the light got
[1:50:20] brighter he got slower and slow and up
[1:50:22] after a while he come to a stop and the
[1:50:25] light was not coming from any certain
[1:50:28] place just all around and he said oh
[1:50:30] such a feeling to stand in that
[1:50:34] presence and there was a voice that came
[1:50:36] from the light and said who approaches
[1:50:38] my
[1:50:39] Throne like a great thunder coming
[1:50:42] out he said oh god Jehovah I'm an
[1:50:45] evangelist any green and I was turned
[1:50:48] away from the Gates of Heaven and I I
[1:50:50] was asked to appeal my case
[1:50:53] at your
[1:50:55] Justice he says very
[1:50:58] well I'll try you by my
[1:51:01] law Danny Green have you ever told a
[1:51:05] lie he said to that time I thought I'd
[1:51:08] been at least an honest man
[1:51:10] truthful but he said oh in that presence
[1:51:14] I've seen that I told a many a little
[1:51:16] things was kind of
[1:51:18] crooked had a had a double
[1:51:21] meaning and he said yes Lord I've
[1:51:24] lied Danny Green have you ever you ever
[1:51:31] steal he says if anything I thought I
[1:51:33] I'd been an honest man but in that
[1:51:36] presence of that light I remembered a
[1:51:38] many
[1:51:39] things little AAL that I pulled was
[1:51:43] shady brother and sister in the church
[1:51:46] around the neighborhood in the presence
[1:51:48] of your pastor you may seem pretty good
[1:51:53] but
[1:51:54] wait but
[1:51:56] wait till you're in the presence of that
[1:51:59] light that Perfect
[1:52:01] Light then he said he heard a voice come
[1:52:05] again and said Danny Green my Justice
[1:52:06] requires
[1:52:08] Perfection were you perfect in
[1:52:11] life he said no Lord I wasn't
[1:52:18] perfect he says I was just ready to hear
[1:52:21] this great blast come down and said I
[1:52:23] seemed like my bones and had
[1:52:26] disconnected I was shaken like I
[1:52:28] couldn't
[1:52:29] stop then I Heard a Voice that was as
[1:52:32] sweet as I ever
[1:52:35] heard said no mother could speak like
[1:52:38] that he said I turned and looked and I
[1:52:40] saw the sweetest face I ever
[1:52:45] saw he
[1:52:47] said he walked up and put his arms
[1:52:50] around me and said father that's true
[1:52:52] true Danny Green wasn't a perfect wasn't
[1:52:55] perfect in his life but there's one
[1:52:58] thing that he did in his life he stood
[1:53:00] for me down on
[1:53:07] Earth so here in heaven I'll stand for
[1:53:12] him he goes on to say I wonder tonight
[1:53:14] friends while we're in a
[1:53:17] group many facing others maybe some in
[1:53:21] their last as Mortals if you should die
[1:53:25] tonight who would stand for
[1:53:27] you your church your pastor your mother
[1:53:30] your father let me introduce you to
[1:53:33] one if you can't stand for him tonight
[1:53:36] or if you can stand for him tonight
[1:53:38] he'll stand for
[1:53:43] you now I don't read that because I
[1:53:45] realize that not all of us will come up
[1:53:48] to White Throne
[1:53:50] judgment but here we are in in the house
[1:53:52] of God and I can feel his
[1:53:55] presence a house of
[1:53:58] correction and I say oh God judge me
[1:54:02] now Lord we surrender Our Lives before
[1:54:05] you
[1:54:06] now Lord we want to say if there's
[1:54:08] anything that's not like you Lord if
[1:54:11] there any any fault or any failure or
[1:54:15] anything Lord would you correct us
[1:54:18] now take those Earthly things from our
[1:54:21] lives let us run the race that is set
[1:54:24] before us oh God and Father you put this
[1:54:27] on My
[1:54:30] Heart Lord is there one I don't
[1:54:35] [Music]

[1:54:43] then don't let them wait until they come
[1:54:46] up to the Gates of
[1:54:49] Heaven because in that presence
[1:54:54] in that presence there's nothing you can
[1:54:57] hide and that's why we're here in his
[1:54:59] presence on a Wednesday

[1:55:39] want to reflect the son of man Lord let
[1:55:42] our lives reflect
[1:55:45] that let that true reflection come oh
