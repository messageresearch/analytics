[37:40] this
[37:41] morning amen I know who's here
[37:45] you you got to believe it it's his word
[37:47] it's his promise
[37:50] right just share a little testimony
[37:53] really quick before we sing the song
[37:55] because it I think it had a little bit
[37:57] more meaning to the
[37:58] words that day my wife and I were
[38:00] fellowshipping about some things and we
[38:03] were talking about present
[38:06] needs and you know how God Is So present
[38:09] and amen something come over me and I
[38:11] was like you know I said it's kind of
[38:15] like this in the natural I said uh our
[38:18] son sits down at the table and he's
[38:20] hungry right there that's his present
[38:23] need but we've born into a family we
[38:28] were educated with certain education to
[38:30] get a certain job to earn a certain
[38:32] paycheck to cash that check at the bank
[38:34] and take it to the store gather the
[38:37] goods bring them home prepare a meal
[38:40] there was a lot of preparation going in
[38:42] to meeting that present need that's a
[38:45] very finite thought considering that God
[38:48] started working on our need before the
[38:51] foundation of the world ever
[38:53] began and not only did he start working
[38:55] on it but he started started running
[38:58] come on brother yes sir I'm telling you
[39:01] this morning
[39:03] Hallelujah he began to run to us from
[39:06] that moment in time knowing right where
[39:09] we would be right where we would set
[39:11] this morning exactly what the need is
[39:13] that you have present tense he began to
[39:16] put things in place and
[39:18] running not hesitating but running to
[39:21] meet that amen so maybe if you think
[39:24] about that thought for just a minute the
[39:26] words of this song will meet a little
[39:28] bit differently to
[39:29] [Music]
[39:35] us
[39:36] almighty
[39:41] God The Great I
[39:47] Am immovable Rock
[39:51] omnipotent powerful awesome God
[39:59] Victorious
[40:03] Warrior commanding King of Kings Mighty
[40:08] conqueror and the only
[40:12] time think about it now the only time I
[40:17] ever saw him
[40:21] run was when he ran to me he took took
[40:26] me in his arms held my head to his chest
[40:30] and said my sons come home again lifted
[40:35] my face he wiped the tears from my eyes
[40:38] with forgiveness in his voice he said
[40:42] Son do you know I still love
[40:48] you oh he CAU me by
[40:53] surprise When God Ran
[41:00] the day I left
[41:03] home I knew I'd broken his
[41:09] heart and I wondered then if things
[41:13] could ever be the same then one
[41:19] night I remembered his love for
[41:24] me and down that dusty road ahead I
[41:29] could see it was the only
[41:34] time it was the only time I ever saw him
[41:42] run and he run to me he took me in his
[41:47] arms held my head to his chest and said
[41:51] my sons come home again lifted my face
[41:56] wiped the tears from my eyes with
[41:59] forgiveness in his voice he said Son do
[42:03] you know I still love
[42:08] you he caught me by
[42:13] surprise and he brought me to my
[42:18] knees When God
[42:21] [Applause]
[42:23] Ran I saw him run to me
[42:27] he took me in his arms held my head to
[42:30] his chest and said my sons come home
[42:34] again lifted my face he wiped the tears
[42:38] from my eyes with forgiveness in his
[42:41] voice he said
[42:44] Son oh this morning he said
[42:50] Son oh he called me
[42:55] son and he said do you
[42:59] know I still love
[43:04] [Laughter]
[43:06] you he called me by
[43:11] surprise he brought me to my
[43:16] knees When God
[43:23] Ran thank you

[43:40] you here today welcome back it's good to

[43:45] God bless you all this morning it's uh

[43:51] away from
[43:52] home I'm very thankful that we made it
[43:54] one more time uh every year is a
[43:57] blessing to us amen uh in more ways than
[43:59] one but it's good to be here today and
[44:02] uh and you know I feel a little
[44:04] important here today at least I get to
[44:06] sing once in a while at home I don't
[44:08] sing at
[44:10] all I remember my grandpa you know and
[44:13] that it was a long time ago but back in
[44:14] the 50s and uh it was the time when
[44:18] horses were being faded out and automob
[44:21] begin to come in you know the model T's
[44:24] and a and and uh in the well it was
[44:26] already in the 30s 40s and 50s but it
[44:30] was a place one little thing he hated to
[44:32] let go he liked his running horse he
[44:36] called a major one that he hooked his
[44:37] buggy up to and and every once in a
[44:39] while he'd go for a ride and then he get
[44:41] a little he put him to pasture you know
[44:42] after a while I kind of feel like I'm
[44:45] put to pasture because I'm
[44:47] old made me think of that maybe every
[44:51] once in a while he'd go out and you with
[44:53] a little uh bit of oats and bring him in
[44:55] and he' harness him I remember one
[44:58] particular time I was out on the field
[45:00] working already it was about 12 years
[45:01] old and uh my grandfather came out with
[45:04] his horse and buggy just to show me the
[45:07] era that he'd been in it was a fading
[45:11] area and it's a fading era no matter
[45:14] what we're we're enjoying this moment
[45:15] but there's something greater the
[45:17] greatest of all things is to meet the
[45:20] one physically with a body like his own
[45:24] glorious body now we know we're fading
[45:27] and I've heard you've had quite a bit of
[45:28] good times bad times but they didn't
[45:31] just go over in this church they're
[45:33] everywhere some have passed away in the
[45:36] last year others have been born some of
[45:39] the cutest little babies and some of are
[45:40] my very close
[45:42] Kim some of it's Justin's fault
[45:45] yeah some of the cutest little
[45:47] things but I'm great to sing a song that
[45:50] I feel is one of my you know it's not
[45:52] you know there's so many good songs in
[45:53] the world that that but everyone one
[45:56] once in a while some of the songs that
[45:58] stick with you yeah had it not been
[46:01] right for a man called
[46:03] Jesus where would we be that's right
[46:06] what would we be and it's not to go back
[46:10] to pastor and get the old horse out but
[46:11] look once in a while it's good to look
[46:13] back where you came from why you're
[46:15] sitting where you're at what was it that
[46:18] did it had it not been that's right for
[46:21] our name's been written in the Lamb's
[46:22] Book of Life before the foundation of
[46:24] the world not only did he cover our sin
[46:28] but he divorced it's not even existence
[46:30] Hallelujah the prophet
[46:33] said God has never seen your sin it's
[46:36] always had an atonement but we didn't
[46:39] recognize it till he revealed it to
[46:41] us just
[46:44] suppose God
[46:47] search through
[46:50] [Music]
[46:52] Heaven he couldn't
[46:54] find what one
[46:57] willing to
[47:02] be the
[47:05] spreme
[47:07] sacrifice that was
[47:09] [Music]
[47:12] needed to buy eternal life Hallelujah
[47:18] for you and
[47:23] me had it not been
[47:27] for a place
[47:28] called Mount
[47:31] [Music]
[47:33] Calvary and had it not
[47:36] been for the old
[47:39] ruged
[47:40] [Music]
[47:43] cross oh had it not
[47:46] been for a man called
[47:50] [Music]
[47:53] Jesus then for
[47:56] ever my soul would be
[48:01] [Music]
[48:04] lost I'm so
[48:06] glad he was willing to drink his bitter
[48:14] cup although he
[48:16] prayed father let it pass from
[48:24] me and I'm so
[48:26] glad they never

[52:54] Lord
[52:55] God bless you all this morning it's been
[52:58] a while since I've
[53:00] been behind the pulpit as far as
[53:03] actually
[53:04] Ministry I want to say thank you to all
[53:07] of those in position whether they are my
[53:11] helpers directly within the
[53:14] ministry or Those Behind the Scenes
[53:18] musicians each and every one our
[53:22] technicians they all take up the slack
[53:24] in our absence
[53:26] am and
[53:28] um
[53:30] so uh this is being the first time in
[53:33] the pulpit in
[53:37] 2024 and
[53:39] um I have great expectations for this
[53:42] year amen amen because God's going to be
[53:46] greater than he ever has
[53:49] been would I be odd to
[53:52] say that I want this to be the year of
[53:55] his catching away of his
[53:58] bride there's so many things happening
[54:00] I'm kind of so so very tired of this
[54:04] world and the way that it's going and I
[54:09] think like that mother Eagle what she
[54:12] does when it's time from them Eagles to
[54:15] fly she starts pulling out all of the
[54:18] soft
[54:20] stuff
[54:22] well I've been poked and prodded
[54:26] there ain't nothing soft in this world
[54:28] to sit down on
[54:31] oh you look at the news makes you
[54:35] sick you know
[54:37] amen there's only one news that'll make
[54:40] you happy that's a good
[54:43] news amen and he told us these things
[54:47] would he said it'll get worse and worse
[54:49] seducers will wax worse and worse and
[54:52] when you see this happening and that
[54:53] happening we see it happening we see
[54:56] Israel in the Homeland we see it we see
[54:59] he says and trouble in on every hand and
[55:02] Nation against nation and wars and
[55:04] rumors and
[55:07] Wars but look
[55:10] up because these things must come to
[55:14] pass but I tell you they're just kind of
[55:17] squeezing in on you huh bombarding the
[55:20] Min and maybe that's the squeeze he's
[55:22] talking about cuz he get squeezed from
[55:25] down here below get squeezed from
[55:27] everything like that like a tube of
[55:28] toothpaste you squeeze it too much and
[55:30] guess which way it goes we're getting
[55:33] out of here praise the Lord so um
[55:37] several told me this morning to keep my
[55:39] train of
[55:44] thought where was
[55:46] I um and to stay with my notes and God
[55:51] bless you musicians thank you so much
[55:53] God bless you played so nicely in the
[55:55] song
[55:57] specials and brother meno God bless you
[55:59] brother
[56:01] James praise the Lord
[56:07] um
[56:10] so let's turn to the Book of
[56:13] Genesis Book of Genesis chapter
[56:21] 17 now the reason that minister actually
[56:25] should have an outline of some sort or
[56:28] some
[56:30] notes is that they are taking you in a
[56:33] certain
[56:35] direction so this morning I want to take
[56:37] you somewhere I think every Minister
[56:39] when he preaches he's taking you
[56:42] somewhere or he may take you
[56:45] nowhere he may take you on just a little
[56:48] path over here uh over into Jeremiah
[56:51] over into Ezekiel this and that when it
[56:53] gets done there ain't no picture
[56:55] right you say okay it was good he had a
[56:58] lot of inspiration he shouted his
[57:01] quotes but it had no
[57:04] effect
[57:06] so when a minister when he gets done you
[57:09] should be able to say I see the picture
[57:12] I understand what he was saying because
[57:16] the Bible says even a wayfaring man
[57:18] could understand the ways of
[57:20] Jesus and so the reason that we have
[57:24] notes is so we kind of have a train of
[57:27] thought that we go in a certain
[57:29] direction and it's just an outline and
[57:32] then God does the filling Genesis
[57:36] 17 veres
[57:42] 1-5 and when Abram was 90 years old and
[57:47] nine the Lord appeared to
[57:50] Abram and said unto him I am the
[57:53] almighty God
[57:57] God walk before me and be thou
[58:02] perfect
[58:04] my he says I am almighty God I'm met
[58:08] should
[58:10] I and I want you to walk before me
[58:13] perfect I imagine
[58:16] that he swallowed quite heavy like oh
[58:21] my because what God requests he requires
[58:28] amen and I will make my Covenant between
[58:32] me in thee and will multiply thee
[58:37] exceedingly and Abram fell on his
[58:41] face and God talked with him
[58:45] saying as for me behold my
[58:49] Covenant is with
[58:51] thee and thou shalt be a father of many
[58:56] nations neither shall thy name anymore
[59:00] be called
[59:01] Abram but thy name shall be
[59:05] Abraham for a father of many
[59:10] nations have I made thee
[59:13] amen
[59:15] God
[59:17] appearing to Abraham for a
[59:21] purpose Abraham has tried he has
[59:24] struggled
[59:26] he has pondered he has prayed he has
[59:30] done everything humanly possible to
[59:34] bring the promise to pass and he was a
[59:42] failure kind of reminds us of us amen we
[59:46] try to make things come to pass but you
[59:49] know what it's actually God who does it
[59:54] that's right and I hope to substantiate
[59:56] some of this to you throughout this
[1:00:00] sermon turn with me if you would to Luke
[1:00:07] 17 Luke chap 17:
[1:00:12] 28 and
[1:00:17] 30 very familiar portion of
[1:00:20] scripture this
[1:00:23] morning and
[1:00:26] if you're there say Amen Luke 17 verse
[1:00:30] 28
[1:00:33] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:00:37] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[1:00:42] they sold they planted they
[1:00:45] builded actually there's nothing
[1:00:49] wrong with what they're doing that's
[1:00:53] right
[1:00:55] but the same
[1:00:57] day that lot went out of
[1:01:03] Sodom yes it rained fire and brimstone
[1:01:08] from
[1:01:09] heaven and destroyed them
[1:01:13] all even thus shall it be in the day
[1:01:18] when the son of
[1:01:20] man is revealed may the Lord add the
[1:01:24] blessing L to the reading of his word
[1:01:25] you may be seated this morning in the
[1:01:28] presence of the
[1:01:33] Lord God bless you brother Mike
[1:01:35] Patterson I heard you weren't feeling
[1:01:37] well I am so very very pleased my
[1:01:40] brother that you're here you and sister
[1:01:43] py
[1:01:45] amen precious friends of
[1:01:48] ours
[1:01:51] amen he'd inspired me many many times
[1:01:56] as a young man in the early
[1:01:58] Ministry up there in our church in
[1:02:04] Flagstaff now I want all of you to
[1:02:07] understand let me just for just a moment
[1:02:10] relax my spirit the prophet of God says
[1:02:14] that he had been away he says I've been
[1:02:17] out of the pulpit for three
[1:02:19] months longest time since he had started
[1:02:22] his ministry and he says you all know he
[1:02:26] says there's a
[1:02:29] channel there's uh an anointing that
[1:02:33] you've got to find an
[1:02:36] inspiration and so I wish to kind of
[1:02:38] relax my mind here for just a moment
[1:02:41] before I get into it and share some
[1:02:45] things that the Lord's been dealing with
[1:02:48] on my heart the Bible says that the
[1:02:51] testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:02:54] is the spirit of
[1:02:58] Prophecy so I want you to understand
[1:03:00] that this
[1:03:02] message that we hold dear to our heart
[1:03:05] is a very
[1:03:06] Supernatural
[1:03:09] message we are compassed about by a

[1:18:34] eler it was a good time for eler was a
[1:18:39] faithful
[1:18:40] servant he was sent to go find a
[1:18:44] bride for
[1:18:46] Isaac how many of you can say I've heard
[1:18:49] elaser yes
[1:18:51] sir eler didn't talk about
[1:18:55] himself elazer was not trying to take
[1:18:58] honor to him he wasn't trying to get the
[1:19:02] bride to marry him right amen he was
[1:19:06] pointing so much to Isaac he says I've
[1:19:11] got some
[1:19:13] jewels that Isaac gave me I got some
[1:19:17] gifts that Isaac gave me on I got some
[1:19:21] garments
[1:19:23] that Isaac gave
[1:19:25] me and while he was yet in prayer oh
[1:19:33] God thy servant doesn't have the
[1:19:37] ability to find the woman this virtuous
[1:19:42] woman right for Isaac right on but if
[1:19:46] thou would see favor to thy
[1:19:51] servant oh God
[1:19:54] would you let her enter the
[1:19:59] scene for I have not much
[1:20:02] time right and would you let her if I
[1:20:07] ask her of
[1:20:09] water would you let her repeat I'll not
[1:20:13] only give you
[1:20:14] water but I'll Water your
[1:20:19] camels Hallelujah and he no sooner
[1:20:23] prayed and ended his prayer until here
[1:20:28] she come she come no doubt with a water
[1:20:32] pot God does something with women around
[1:20:38] Wells come on Amen and here she
[1:20:44] come woman would
[1:20:46] you give me to
[1:20:49] drink
[1:20:50] oh look at her attitude
[1:20:54] yeah
[1:20:56] well might cost you a little something
[1:20:58] if you ask me to get you a
[1:21:00] drink no no she would no I hey I'll be
[1:21:03] more than happy too she' been taught
[1:21:05] right she's got
[1:21:08] virtue she's a reflection of
[1:21:14] something so hey not hey you know what I
[1:21:18] got an idea your camels are looking at
[1:21:21] me real thirsty
[1:21:24] too you do you know how much they
[1:21:27] drink when they're thirsty they can eat
[1:21:30] drink almost 30 gallons each and if you
[1:21:32] got a f you ever carried five gallons of
[1:21:35] water now I don't know how many camels
[1:21:38] there were but this is an all morning
[1:21:46] job now what is it she stepped into the
[1:21:51] vision he had prayed prayed and while he
[1:21:53] was finishing his
[1:21:55] prayer choosing a
[1:21:58] bride catch it spiritually while he's
[1:22:02] preaching the words that God what he's
[1:22:05] looking
[1:22:06] for what kind of a woman he wants to
[1:22:10] marry and everything and she comes on
[1:22:13] the scene I want you to know that while
[1:22:16] this Prophet was yet preaching what kind
[1:22:19] of woman God is looking for here it was
[1:22:23] many of you some of you may not have
[1:22:25] been born but God knew you would be God
[1:22:28] knew he knew there was a time but in the
[1:22:30] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:22:33] when he should begin to
[1:22:36] sound praise the Lord and then
[1:22:40] Rebecca she falls in love not with
[1:22:44] elaser she falls in love
[1:22:47] with Isaac who's
[1:22:51] unseen
[1:22:54] because elaser had painted such a good
[1:22:58] picture that she
[1:23:00] said
[1:23:02] Hallelujah I'll go where do I
[1:23:07] sign and the Bible says and she jeweled
[1:23:11] herself she took the
[1:23:17] gifts it she took the
[1:23:21] garments they were Isaac's
[1:23:25] yeah they were the ones that Isaac
[1:23:28] chose there's probably no doubt in my
[1:23:31] mind that when he went
[1:23:34] shopping and he went through the market
[1:23:37] that morning
[1:23:39] here
[1:23:41] yeah yeah no this one's better she'll be
[1:23:45] about this
[1:23:47] big he throws it over the arm of eler
[1:23:50] they're walking through the the Garment
[1:23:52] getting the the different colors and
[1:23:55] everything and he says wrap them up he
[1:23:58] said that's for my
[1:24:00] bride and because watch
[1:24:04] this when Isaac sees her yep he knows
[1:24:09] it's
[1:24:11] her
[1:24:13] why that's the
[1:24:15] dress those are the
[1:24:19] garments ooo I can start preaching
[1:24:27] and it's got to be because there's El
[1:24:30] eer there's the camel the power the
[1:24:35] Beast that is to and brother Brenham

[1:25:53] word hallelujah word upon word line upon
[1:25:57] line
[1:26:02] Hallelujah
[1:26:03] now I feel
[1:26:08] comfortable let's see how far I can go
[1:26:10] in my
[1:26:14] notes the revealing of the son of man in
[1:26:17] the third
[1:26:19] pole the mystery continues
[1:26:24] the ministry
[1:26:26] continues and the voice yeah continues
[1:26:31] amen because some say the mystery was
[1:26:37] finished well he's finishing up the
[1:26:42] mystery but we realize that we're a part
[1:26:45] of that mystery so therefore and I say
[1:26:48] this in
[1:26:50] humility God is revealing more to me now
[1:26:55] than I did when I first came into the
[1:26:57] message why my maturity requires
[1:27:01] it that's right because when I was a
[1:27:05] child I spake I I thought I understood
[1:27:10] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:27:14] away childish
[1:27:16] things people who do not give up
[1:27:20] childish things on their own are
[1:27:24] spoiled some are
[1:27:27] brats some like
[1:27:30] you and me at times don't want something
[1:27:33] taken from us and you throw a little fit
[1:27:37] but that's okay you're still his Papa's
[1:27:41] just going to have to deal with
[1:27:46] you I've said this I don't
[1:27:49] mind a brat once in a while but I don't

[1:29:09] enough there are times God going to tell
[1:29:12] you he may laugh at a little something
[1:29:13] you do and another time he's going to
[1:29:15] say that's
[1:29:17] enough you know the
[1:29:19] difference I did it with God one time
[1:29:22] there on the beaches of San Diego yeah
[1:29:25] story yes sir I did it I was having a
[1:29:28] hard time with some issues in my own
[1:29:30] life and uh you know I got mad at God
[1:29:33] put my hands up there on
[1:29:35] the the beach in San Diego there and I
[1:29:38] said why why
[1:29:41] now boy I realized it was as
[1:29:46] though I knew that God stood up and I'm
[1:29:50] in trouble
[1:29:53] oh yeah yeah
[1:29:55] uh-huh and I thought oh oh yeah yeah he
[1:29:59] said you're going to step on a stingray
[1:30:02] I'm out
[1:30:04] surfing yeah you all know the story so
[1:30:06] I'm not going to tell it again anyway I
[1:30:08] stepped on one wow and God used that as
[1:30:14] a testimony to bring Mitch Buckingham in
[1:30:17] amen that's another story I do not have
[1:30:20] Alzheimer's I am telling this for a
[1:30:24] purpose okay stay with your notes Ron
[1:30:30] don't all right all right now remember
[1:30:35] now we just took Genesis
[1:30:38] 17 and whenever I look at the
[1:30:41] scriptures I always like to dissect it
[1:30:44] and looked at it because I know there is
[1:30:46] something very important going on and
[1:30:47] here God he has spoken to Abraham many
[1:30:51] times
[1:30:53] he's told him you're going to have a son
[1:30:55] I want you to sojourn in a land I want
[1:30:58] you to go and be a pilgrim and a
[1:30:59] stranger and he leaves his family and we
[1:31:02] see Abraham or let's call him Abram at
[1:31:05] the time is going in he's on his journey
[1:31:09] yes amen now he's gone through all kinds
[1:31:11] of things and I'm not going to rehearse
[1:31:14] all of that but he's a man that's
[1:31:16] familiar with the
[1:31:18] supernatural God deals with him by way
[1:31:20] of Revelation and God speaks to him I
[1:31:23] want all of you to start asking God for
[1:31:26] more Revelation because it is God's will
[1:31:29] to deal with you in Revelation that's
[1:31:31] what makes you different than those out
[1:31:33] here otherwise you'd be in a Catholic
[1:31:36] Church you'd be in a Baptist Church
[1:31:38] you'd be out there you'd be somewhere
[1:31:40] sitting on a bar stool you'd be doing
[1:31:41] something else or serving your own
[1:31:45] God but God rich in Mercy has seen fit
[1:31:49] Amen to call you to come out of that
[1:31:55] nonsense so every time that God Appears
[1:31:57] he does it for a purpose amen amen
[1:32:01] so I want you to stop there for a moment
[1:32:04] and think God's dealing with Abraham but
[1:32:08] Abraham has now I'm going to turn back
[1:32:11] here for just a moment and I catch
[1:32:13] inspiration off his scripture
[1:32:17] amen thank you Lord he's 99 years old
[1:32:21] yeah
[1:32:25] right and the Lord appears to
[1:32:28] him and he tells him I'm almighty
[1:32:31] God now all of this is for a purpose
[1:32:34] amen God's appearing have a purpose
[1:32:38] God's revealings to you have a purpose
[1:32:42] am and every time that God gives you
[1:32:46] understanding when he gives you
[1:32:47] Revelation it's for a purpose the lion
[1:32:52] and the bear was for a purpose because
[1:32:55] there would be a Goliath and he would
[1:32:58] say the same God watch this he was
[1:33:01] taking his track record and backing up
[1:33:04] oh I remember the lion oh I remember the
[1:33:08] bear I remember that the same God that
[1:33:12] delivered me back then is the same God
[1:33:16] that will deliver you you big
[1:33:18] uncircumcised
[1:33:20] philistine
[1:33:22] Hallelujah you come against me with
[1:33:24] sword and spear I come against you in
[1:33:26] the name of the god of
[1:33:29] Israel
[1:33:33] amen Abraham was
[1:33:38] experiencing the word appear I want you
[1:33:40] to understand this the word appear in
[1:33:45] Hebrew is
[1:33:47] RA r a
[1:33:50] a and God appeared
[1:33:55] raw and it means to see to discern or to
[1:34:00] experience

[1:35:01] this was Experiencing God
[1:35:05] Amen he was Discerning God he was
[1:35:08] catching the vision of
[1:35:11] God
[1:35:12] Amen God Appears to us through prophetic
[1:35:16] Ministry in our day we call it the
[1:35:18] message of the
[1:35:20] hour but he's doing it for a purpose am
[1:35:30] amen he's not just making you a church
[1:35:35] member he's not making you
[1:35:40] religious I can't stand religious
[1:35:46] people amen a message without Revelation
[1:35:50] turns to religion
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:53] makes Creeds
[1:35:56] dogmas traditions of
[1:36:00] man so we can
[1:36:03] see God does everything for a
[1:36:06] purpose now in Acts 26: 15-8 we're going
[1:36:11] to see God calling Saul remember Saul on
[1:36:14] his high horse he's been persecuting all
[1:36:16] of the Christians throwing them in
[1:36:19] prison and then God appears to an ananas
[1:36:22] and tells him I want you to go and pray
[1:36:24] lay hands on
[1:36:25] Saul he says
[1:36:28] um excuse me did did you say
[1:36:32] Saul Saul of
[1:36:35] Tarsus Saul the one who's
[1:36:39] killing
[1:36:44] him now that to Hey listen of everybody
[1:36:48] in the scripture I think that guy had
[1:36:49] the hardest task

[1:36:56] kids
[1:36:59] adios
[1:37:05] Noosa just I ain't coming back man
[1:37:09] because what if this what if it's a
[1:37:12] false
[1:37:14] Revelation anyway he goes there and
[1:37:17] right he's got to pray for him right now
[1:37:20] watch here it is
[1:37:21] here's the reason acts 26:1
[1:37:25] 15 and I said who art thou Lord now only
[1:37:29] a prophet caught this he said here is a
[1:37:32] Pharisee who's taught to not just call

[1:37:58] heretic that these cult guys are
[1:38:01] following I am

[1:51:35] normal I said I can't wait now I start I
[1:51:38] get on my little soap box and I got a
[1:51:40] loud voice anyway I says I can't wait
[1:51:44] for God to burn this Sodom condition
[1:51:48] these bunch of pre rted people around
[1:51:51] you know and I get know and my brother
[1:51:53] okay man cool it you know look it's okay
[1:51:57] yeah I said he's going to burn this
[1:52:00] place off like Sodom and gomorra and oh
[1:52:04] man I just want that's okay it's
[1:52:10] okay now why did God give Abraham a
[1:52:15] covenant he said this Covenant is
[1:52:18] between me and thee
[1:52:21] thank and in
[1:52:23] fact in Genesis
[1:52:27] 17:15 it's the first time in mentioning
[1:52:30] the Covenant that Sarah is mentioned
[1:52:33] every other time the promise Sarah's
[1:52:36] never
[1:52:37] mentioned I'm going to give you
[1:52:41] seed but so now he's seeing the Covenant
[1:52:45] includes Abram and Sarah yeah and you're
[1:52:49] you're going to have a
[1:52:51] son
[1:52:53] right so it's a it's a covenant and the
[1:52:56] Covenant and I will give unto you a
[1:53:01] sign and that sign shall be
[1:53:05] circumcision is that
[1:53:07] right it is a sign between me and
[1:53:10] you that I have accepted your faith amen
[1:53:15] and I am sealing you yeah because now
[1:53:19] watch this cuz brother Brenham tells us
[1:53:22] circumcision of the Old Testament is the
[1:53:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost of the
[1:53:30] new now I'm not going to hold you much
[1:53:32] longer and I'm not going to go off here
[1:53:36] too much right now but I want to say
[1:53:38] this brother Brenham said of all the
[1:53:40] sermons I
[1:53:41] preached he said the
[1:53:44] Capstone one of all the sermons I've
[1:53:47] preached of 1,400 sermons
[1:53:50] does anyone know the name token the
[1:53:54] token he said if I ever preached
[1:53:57] anything
[1:53:58] inspired it was the
[1:54:02] token he said because without the token
[1:54:06] you ain't getting out of
[1:54:08] here he said that's what makes the
[1:54:10] difference between foolish and
[1:54:13] wise have you
[1:54:17] received very serious now
[1:54:20] only you can answer this have you
[1:54:22] received the Seal of
[1:54:28] God do you know you have the Holy
[1:54:32] Ghost has he sealed you to the day of
[1:54:35] your
[1:54:37] Redemption because without
[1:54:40] it you'll stay here with your long hair
[1:54:42] and your long
[1:54:48] dress because the long hair and the long
[1:54:51] dress without a revelation to do that is
[1:54:55] only religion it's vain
[1:54:59] worship amen amen so I'm going to give
[1:55:03] you a quote and then we're going to
[1:55:04] close musicans go ahead and come yes

[1:56:25] easy a little bit I'm going to give you
[1:56:28] this last
[1:56:29] quote and then I I'll have brother
[1:56:32] Robert to
[1:56:33] come in the sermon the Perfection
[1:56:38] 1957 what is
[1:56:41] it oh
[1:56:43] God requires
[1:56:47] Perfection he requires your repentance
[1:56:50] he requires your loyalty to
[1:56:53] him but he's looking to to tonight no
[1:56:57] how
[1:56:58] much no matter how much you've sinned
[1:57:02] how little or how much you're still a
[1:57:05] sinner you cannot get in no other way
[1:57:09] but by Jesus
[1:57:11] Christ God's all sufficient sacrifice
[1:57:17] amen what if it had not been for a place
[1:57:21] called Mount
[1:57:23] Calvary thank you
[1:57:26] Lord and in
[1:57:29] him you are perfected
[1:57:32] together
[1:57:34] forever thank
[1:57:37] you think of
[1:57:41] it it's not
[1:57:43] nothing you
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:48] do it's it's not new pages you
[1:57:53] turn it's not a new life you
[1:57:57] start it's a confession of your
[1:58:00] wrong and by God's grace to you that
[1:58:04] brings you to
[1:58:08] Perfection and then you are perfected in
[1:58:12] Jesus
[1:58:14] Christ now I'm going to launch on off
[1:58:17] onto that in the next I got several
[1:58:21] sermons
[1:58:22] here we're going to look into
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:27] it I want all of you to
[1:58:33] understand what we do is because of
[1:58:38] faith and faith is given to you by God's
[1:58:41] grace because by grace are you saved
[1:58:43] through
[1:58:44] faith and that being not of yourselves
[1:58:48] it is not of work
[1:58:50] but it is God's grace that gave it to
[1:58:53] you and so if any of us ever make Heaven
[1:58:56] our home it's because we were in Christ
[1:59:01] Hallelujah and
[1:59:03] because he cannot forsake
[1:59:08] himself yes that's
[1:59:11] true so our
[1:59:14] Perfection is through our
[1:59:17] sacrifice amen and if he requires us to
[1:59:20] be perfect God you would be an unjust
[1:59:25] God if you required something that I
[1:59:28] could not contain or attain
[1:59:33] to so you got to make a
[1:59:37] way because my righteousness is as
[1:59:40] filthy
[1:59:41] rats for all of sin and come short of
[1:59:44] the glory of God but the grace of
[1:59:47] God amen amen
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:55] wow we take this message my brother and
[1:59:59] we dissect it down we we realize it's
[2:00:03] nothing but God's grace to
[2:00:05] us we weren't looking for it we weren't
[2:00:09] out praying and seeking there might have
[2:00:10] been a few that were looking for it but
[2:00:13] this message came looking for
[2:00:15] you and he says in every predestinated
[2:00:18] seat every elect seed everyone that is
[2:00:21] ordained of God will hear and when they
[2:00:24] hear they will be quickened and when
[2:00:26] they are quickened they are energized
[2:00:27] when they are energized they put into
[2:00:30] manifestation that which they see and if
[2:00:32] they don't see it they can't
[2:00:34] manifest that's
[2:00:37] right that's
[2:00:41] right it's amazing is this is the song I
[2:00:44] wanted them to
[2:00:46] sing and I I like that thank you you
