[24:08] Father we are so grateful tonight Lord
[24:10] that we are in your
[24:12] presence we're so thankful of the things
[24:15] that you have done for us Lord this all
[24:17] these years Lord God you never fail us

[24:22] fall we have discouragement but it was
[24:24] your grace that lift us up Lord give us
[24:27] hope us courage which give us Lord
[24:29] victories and we thank you tonight Lord
[24:32] that you are we are a living testimonies
[24:34] of your grace once again be with us as
[24:37] we have Fellowship around your word Lord
[24:39] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[24:43] so let us uh turn directly to the word
[24:45] of God in the Book of
[24:50] Revelation Revelation chapter 2 verse 25
[24:53] this is a three portion of
[24:56] scripture revelation 225 Revelation 3 3
[25:00] and Revelation
[25:06] 3:1 Revelations 2:25 it says but that
[25:10] which he have already hold fast till I
[25:13] come amen
[25:16] amen we know that the Believers of that
[25:18] age died holding the truth that they had
[25:22] received for that
[25:23] age and they are still holding it right
[25:26] now
[25:28] in a different place or the other
[25:30] dimension
[25:32] amen and we realize that only that only
[25:37] change the dwelling place but it doesn't
[25:40] change what you
[25:43] believe so hold
[25:45] fast Revelation 3 chapter 3 remember
[25:49] therefore how thou Hast received and
[25:54] heard you have received the word you
[25:57] have heard the word
[25:58] and hold fast
[26:01] amen so we'll jump to Revelation
[26:05] 3:1 behold I come quickly yes sir hold
[26:10] that fast which thou Hast that no man
[26:12] take thy Crown so we will notice again
[26:15] in each of these ages hold fast hold
[26:18] fast hold fast amen the truth that you
[26:21] have received for your age hold fast to
[26:24] that till he come may the Lord add a
[26:26] blessing upon his weding word you may be
[26:31] seated so I would like to take this
[26:34] short sermon in Revelation chap 225 as
[26:36] my title behold that which ye have
[26:39] already hold fast till I come amen hold
[26:42] fast till I come so it is the word of
[26:45] encouragement for us for this new year
[26:48] to let these things sleep of what is
[26:51] most important sleep from us by the
[26:54] destructions of this age as the prophet
[26:57] said whatever we do do right now
[26:59] whatever situation or
[27:01] do or what we are doing right now as the
[27:06] prophet said we just need to keep
[27:09] carrying on till he comes that's right
[27:13] so it's our duty to keep carrying on
[27:16] until he comes amen so the word that
[27:19] he's given us we need to hold unto it
[27:23] till he comes that's right because as
[27:26] the Believers of this hour we are at
[27:28] once against the age of unbelief of what
[27:31] Satan is trying to take from us of the
[27:34] truth of what God has rightfully given
[27:37] to us in this hour we are in the the
[27:42] Satan's Eden once again andone has
[27:44] bombarded us of all things of kind of uh
[27:48] things that take away our
[27:51] belief so that is why just like Daniel
[27:54] when he was under the Babylon
[27:58] he saw all these things under Babylon so
[28:02] he purposes in heart that he will not
[28:04] defile himself with the king's portions
[28:07] and we know that we are once again in
[28:09] the modern
[28:10] Babylon
[28:15] so and that is why that's like David and
[28:18] them in babyon we must purpose also in
[28:21] our heart to carry on at our post of
[28:24] Duty serving the lord amen serving the
[28:27] lord hearing his word reading his word
[28:30] we need to purpose it in our heart
[28:33] because the more we hear the word of God
[28:35] the more we are encouraged and the more
[28:37] we are encouraged the more we become the
[28:40] word we need to have a purpose in life
[28:43] in this last days because if you don't
[28:45] know your purpose life is
[28:48] meaningless but God called us for a
[28:51] certain purpose and that is to manifest
[28:53] his word in these last days thank you
[28:56] Lord that's why the prophet said the
[28:58] very powerful statement we are just
[29:00] living here once as a
[29:04] moral after this we will be stepping
[29:06] into
[29:08] immortality so we need to hold
[29:11] fast to what we have received amen
[29:15] serving God as much as possible let us
[29:18] not turn to the life or to the left let
[29:21] us
[29:22] Focus serving the
[29:25] lord what uh reading his word and
[29:29] feeding our souls in the revelation of
[29:31] this hour and serving one another in
[29:34] love amen and not to get weary in well
[29:38] doing but to keep carrying on until he
[29:42] comes as the prophet told us so by God's
[29:46] grace that is what I have purposed also
[29:49] in my heart this coming year
[29:52] 2025 hold fast to the word that we have
[29:56] received and never compromise
[29:59] I know there's a lot of bombardment on
[30:01] every side but we have seen already the
[30:05] reveal word of the
[30:08] hour knowing that whatever comes in this
[30:13] 2025 or whatever 2025
[30:16] brings we will trust in the Lord being
[30:19] sure of this one thing that he will work
[30:22] all things out for our good we will when
[30:26] we will come to the end over Road thank
[30:29] you Lord because if we fall if we
[30:32] fail and sometimes we fall and we fail
[30:35] and we got discouraged because we are
[30:37] under this fles amen but one thing is
[30:40] sure when the spirit of the enemy come
[30:44] in like a flood his spirit will raise up
[30:49] a standard against it thank so whatever
[30:53] comes this 2025 whatever the Satan's
[30:57] bombarding
[30:58] make sure that is the spirit of God that
[31:01] will raise us up as a standard so let us
[31:05] not worry let us Trust on the Lord the
[31:08] more we trust on the Lord amen the more
[31:11] he can manifest
[31:13] himself God he will give us strength he
[31:16] will give us hope he will give us
[31:19] encourage and
[31:21] victories so don't worry about what is
[31:24] going to happen by next year I know
[31:27] there will be something happening by
[31:30] 2025 and if we base it according to the
[31:33] Scripture it will it will be getting
[31:37] worse and
[31:39] worse but for the Bride of Jesus
[31:42] Christ God will give us more
[31:45] understanding of his will in these last
[31:47] days amen because in Jeremiah 29:1 he
[31:51] said for I know the thought that I think
[31:53] towards you he knows about you he knows
[31:56] our struggle he knows of our walk and he
[31:58] knows everything said the Lord thoughts
[32:01] of peace and not of able to give you an
[32:04] unexpected
[32:06] end so that's why in Isaiah first
[32:09] Thessalonian 5:21 prove all things and
[32:12] hold fast that which is good amen to
[32:17] hold fast means to attend
[32:20] carefully so we me needed to take care
[32:22] of this word careful in our life to take
[32:26] care of and and to not discard or let go
[32:30] to keep carefully and faithfully and to
[32:33] continue to hold to retain and to guard
[32:37] so we are commanded by the scriptures to
[32:39] be faithful stewards of these Mysteries
[32:43] hold
[32:44] fast that which is
[32:47] good so this truth that we have been
[32:50] given by this message that has come into
[32:52] US is about the only thing in this
[32:56] age that we can TR
[32:58] called
[33:01] good that is the only good thing because
[33:05] the scripture as it was in the days of
[33:07] Noah all the thoughts of men are evil
[33:11] continually that's true but we H the
[33:14] sure word of the promise and that is
[33:17] good and we can find rest in the word of
[33:20] God because everything that happened
[33:22] here is already settled in heaven thank
[33:25] you Lord we just need to believe amen
[33:28] and so to hold fast to the message of
[33:30] this hour we must first have a good
[33:32] understanding of its
[33:34] truth we need the
[33:36] truth and you can ask how do we know the
[33:40] truth brother Mario well the truth will
[33:43] produce life yes it will Hallelujah
[33:46] because the Lord Jesus Christ I am the
[33:49] way he is not only the way he did three
[33:54] things I am the way I am the truth and I
[33:56] am the life that's right if you have if
[34:00] you need salvation Jesus Christ is the
[34:02] way if you need repentance Jesus Christ
[34:05] is the way if you need encouragement
[34:07] Jesus is the way and everybody knows the
[34:10] way even denomination knows the way to
[34:12] Jesus Christ they know to
[34:14] salvation but Jesus said not only the
[34:17] way is not enough to know the way to
[34:19] Jesus Christ not enough you need to be
[34:21] in the
[34:22] truth and some have know the way and
[34:26] they have the truth but they don't have
[34:27] life
[34:29] but this life is not just a church
[34:34] life you may know the way you may do the
[34:37] truth and you can have a church
[34:39] life you can go to church Sunday
[34:42] Wednesday pay your T by your
[34:45] offering but this life means the eternal
[34:49] life the life of Christ within
[34:53] us hallelujah so when we know that we
[34:57] are in truth because the life is being
[35:00] made
[35:01] manifest not the church life but the
[35:04] Life of Christ in you and when the life
[35:07] Christ in you you become his coworker
[35:11] and you will always represent you will
[35:14] become priest and
[35:16] king and a priest always represent the
[35:19] people to God we become a priest so we
[35:23] become we we we will become we stand in
[35:27] the gap you know when some of the
[35:30] brothers fall or fail we stand in the
[35:32] Gap and present it to God that is
[35:36] eternal life living for others amen you
[35:40] don't need to to bring food or you know
[35:43] your prayer
[35:45] alone will eat those people and you
[35:49] present it to God and when you pray to
[35:51] God God will answer it because when you
[35:55] pray in the name of Jesus Christ it's
[35:57] just like like Dy
[35:59] speaking pray to your brother yes sir
[36:02] don't discourage if you know that they
[36:05] fall just pray and God will listen to
[36:08] you because it was the Life of Christ in
[36:11] you amen because God so loved the word
[36:14] that he gave his only begotten son that
[36:16] whosoever believe in him should not
[36:18] perish but have etern life so hold
[36:21] fast it is very important the revelation
[36:23] of this hour is made clear to you by the
[36:26] sealing of the Holy Spirit into our mind
[36:29] and heart not only in our heart in the
[36:32] mind but also in our
[36:34] heart that is what we are striving as a
[36:40] minister I am not a pastor I am just a
[36:46] Helper but it's in my heart to see the
[36:49] people of God established in the word of
[36:52] God thank you
[36:54] Lord even though how small the gift God
[36:58] bestowed upon
[37:01] me I will say it without any fear or
[37:10] fav and when I see the people response
[37:12] to the word of God that's good enough
[37:15] for
[37:16] me I am just doing my
[37:24] portion that we that is what we
[37:28] are striving me striving as a minister
[37:30] to get the elect of God anchored deep on
[37:33] the things of Eternal
[37:36] value and to hold fast unto them until
[37:39] he comes even if we die before the
[37:40] Rapture happened it makes no difference
[37:44] that's right we need to establish the
[37:46] word of God
[37:49] Amen we we we we we we don't
[37:54] really uh as for me I don't really
[37:58] ask for any
[38:00] position because I
[38:03] know the gift of God in my
[38:07] heart so whatever he wants me to do I'll
[38:10] just do it
[38:12] am I don't want to become an
[38:14] international evangelist or whatsoever I
[38:16] am just a local
[38:21] Minister just preaching whatever God
[38:24] puts in my heart as a helper in this
[38:27] church
[38:29] church amen I I I I'm I'm trusting that
[38:32] we are in I believe that we are on this
[38:35] same Journey we need to pray for one
[38:38] another that's why I always told my wife
[38:41] if the minister had a love in his heart
[38:43] he will go deeper to the word of God and
[38:45] Fe the church
[38:47] amen because even young people need a
[38:51] deep things of God
[38:54] sir we don't need lullabi
[38:58] because we are under the anointing of an
[39:01] eagle which is the anointing of a
[39:04] revelation so as an
[39:06] iglet the mother Eagle always fed his
[39:10] eaglet solid
[39:15] meat they don't drink milk because it
[39:18] will upset their
[39:20] stomach they don't eat rotten
[39:23] meat it
[39:25] will upset them and maybe kill them but
[39:29] they are being fed by fresh
[39:33] meat they don't know anything just
[39:36] eating meat eating meat eating
[39:42] meat
[39:44] prise and they didn't realize that their
[39:47] feather is
[39:48] growing as they eat meat their feather
[39:50] is growing they're growing and they're
[39:53] growing and they're
[39:54] growing then why by they can fly by
[39:57] themselves and they can't find the word
[40:02] or the Press meat by themselves that's
[40:05] why as an elect of
[40:07] God we're not being lullabi by any words
[40:11] of denominations am we need solid
[40:14] meat IR regardless of anybody will
[40:17] reject it they will be hurt but we need
[40:21] to speak the truth so hold
[40:25] fast as Hebrews chapter 4 14 seeing then
[40:28] that we have a great high priest that is
[40:30] pass unto Heaven Jesus the son of God
[40:32] let us hold fast unto our
[40:36] profession and Ephesians 4:30 and grieve
[40:39] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[40:41] are sealed until the day of your
[40:44] Redemption when you are sealed you
[40:46] cannot be unsealed because you are
[40:49] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[40:51] that is our
[40:52] consolation because when you receive the
[40:54] Holy Spirit you can grieve it sometimes
[40:59] but that seal cannot be
[41:01] unsealed prise you are sealed until the
[41:04] day of
[41:05] redemption so by this
[41:07] 2025 let all bitterness and wrath and
[41:11] anger and clamor and evil speaking be
[41:13] put away from you with all malice and be
[41:16] ye kind one to another tend the hurter
[41:18] forgiving one another even as God for
[41:21] Christ sake had forgiven
[41:24] you in these years alone we have so many
[41:27] hurt aches and sometime the most uh one
[41:30] that give you hurt aches is uh sometimes
[41:33] your your your relatives your friends
[41:36] and sometimes it hurt it so much but I
[41:39] always told my family never hold grudges
[41:44] that's true amen make sure that your our
[41:46] heart is clean and pure never hold
[41:50] bitterness or grudges because if we are
[41:53] looking for the coming of the lord we
[41:55] need to have a Clean Heart amen so hold
[42:00] fast to
[42:01] them so I will just close this one
[42:05] so I hope it will just encourage
[42:09] us as brother Bram said now beginning
[42:14] the new year I want to say not happy New

[51:22] you has he not been
[51:25] faithful he's been so so good to us what
[51:28] a blessed people we
[51:30] are and to
[51:32] think at the changing of another year
[51:35] he's going to be faithful in
[51:37] 2025 and he's going to be good to us and
[51:39] he's going to take care of us for he's
[51:41] mindful of us and I certainly want to
[51:44] thank brother Ron for the opportunity
[51:46] not only tonight but you know throughout
[51:49] the year to be able to minister to his
[51:51] people and to um he gives us that
[51:55] opportunity and we don't take it lightly
[51:57] and we don't take it for granted because
[51:59] there are you know pastors out there
[52:02] that it's if you want Pulpit time go get
[52:04] Pulpit time somewhere else and you know
[52:07] you see and I and I don't take it
[52:09] lightly brother Ron and I appreciate
[52:12] it and if you have your Bibles let's
[52:15] just turn in our scriptures to Matthew
[52:22] 6 Matthew 6:25
[52:28] and I'm going to read this portion of
[52:30] scripture it's very familiar and I and I
[52:32] believe it's very
[52:35] encouraging in verse 25 says therefore I
[52:37] say unto you take no thought for your
[52:40] life what you shall eat what you shall
[52:42] drink nor eat yet for your body what you
[52:46] shall put
[52:48] on is not the life more than meat and
[52:51] the body than raymen behold the fowls of
[52:54] the air
[52:56] for they sow not neither do they reap
[52:59] nor do they gather into barns yet your
[53:02] heavenly father feed them are ye not
[53:06] much better than
[53:08] they which of You by taking thought can
[53:11] add any add one cubit unto his
[53:15] stature and why take ye thought for
[53:18] reignment consider the lies of the field
[53:20] how that they grow they toil not neither
[53:23] do they spin and yet I say unto you
[53:27] that even Solomon in all his glory was
[53:29] not AR raid like one of
[53:32] these wherefore if God so clothe the
[53:35] grass of the field which today is and
[53:38] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall not
[53:42] he also not much more clothe you oh ye
[53:46] of little
[53:47] faith therefore take no thought saying
[53:50] what we shall eat nor what we shall
[53:53] drink or wherewith All Shall we be
[53:55] clothed
[53:57] for after all these things do the
[53:58] Gentiles seek for your heavenly father
[54:02] knoweth that he have need of all these
[54:06] things but seek ye first the kingdom of
[54:09] God and all his righteousness and all
[54:11] these things will be added unto
[54:13] you take therefore no thought for the
[54:17] tomorrow for the tomorrow shall take
[54:19] thought for
[54:20] itself sufficient unto the day is the
[54:23] evil thereof let's just bow our heads
[54:26] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord at the
[54:29] closing hours of 2024 we just humble
[54:32] ourselves once again and we just ask
[54:33] that we would say something to your
[54:35] people that would encourage them into
[54:37] this coming year be with us I pray in
[54:40] Jesus name amen amen you can be
[54:46] seated you know it's such a special time
[54:49] of year the closing hours of one and the
[54:52] breaking and the dawn of another year
[54:55] and as we begin to look look and you see
[54:57] within this moment that we have within
[55:00] this present moment you can reflect on
[55:03] things that maybe you didn't fulfill or
[55:06] maybe promises you didn't do of this
[55:08] past year or you're looking forward to
[55:11] the the future year of things that you
[55:13] can do and things that you could achieve
[55:15] or or become and as we sit here in this
[55:19] this present moment it's such a special
[55:22] time and the the portion of scripture
[55:24] that we read here that the lies they
[55:26] don't worry about tomorrow they just sit
[55:29] there and they don't they don't worry
[55:31] where they grow or you know through in
[55:33] the muck and in the M all they do is
[55:35] just grow and they're pushing their way
[55:37] up to to to the sunlight and you see the
[55:40] the the fouls of the air they just wake
[55:42] up and they they fly in the morning and
[55:44] they're not worried about this and the
[55:46] the problems of tomorrow and where I'm
[55:48] going to get my next meal no but yet God
[55:51] feeds those the fowls
[55:56] all of creation what is it telling us in
[55:59] this portion of scripture that they're
[56:00] living in a present time they're not
[56:02] worried about the past and they're not
[56:05] worried about the future they're living
[56:06] in the
[56:07] moment and when you begin to W you know
[56:11] how would I say this here that they have
[56:13] faith in their creator that the one that
[56:16] created them is the one that's going to
[56:18] sustain them and that's the same thing
[56:21] with us tonight that we have to have
[56:23] faith that our very creator that created
[56:25] us before the foundation of the world
[56:28] before there was Stardust before all
[56:30] that he's going to sustain us and he's
[56:32] going to keep us into this coming
[56:38] year Psalms 46 And1 says God is our
[56:41] refuge in our strength a very present
[56:45] he's very
[56:46] present in the time of trouble he's not
[56:49] a god of the past he's not a god some
[56:52] statue some something that we worship of
[56:54] of of history but he he's a god of the
[56:57] present he's the god of the now he's the
[56:59] god of your present moment right now and
[57:03] as I begin to think and brother Ron sent
[57:05] the text for us just he asked us what is
[57:07] our vision for us individually as
[57:10] ministers and for our families and for
[57:13] the the church body and the bride
[57:15] globally around the world and as I began
[57:17] to think about it and pray about it
[57:19] something came to me and a sermon title
[57:22] came to me and it was present stage in
[57:25] your ministry
[57:29] what is your present stage of your
[57:30] ministry right
[57:32] now not as a minister but what is your
[57:35] present stage of your ministry because
[57:38] each one of us has a Ministry Our Lives
[57:41] speak volumes if you're living in the
[57:44] present you can't dwell on that past or
[57:46] worry about the future you're focused at
[57:49] the task at hand amen you know and maybe
[57:54] within this last year you're Ministry
[57:56] has
[57:58] changed follow this thought your
[58:00] ministry has changed maybe you've you've
[58:03] gotten married this past year and you
[58:04] became a father you became a wife maybe
[58:07] uh you you you parents you became a
[58:09] grandfather you you became uh you know
[58:12] you went from parent to being a
[58:14] grandparent and so your ministry changes
[58:18] in life and in this journey your
[58:20] ministry can
[58:22] change and you can't use a former mini
[58:25] your former your previous Ministry for
[58:27] your present
[58:29] state so this thought of present stage
[58:33] of your
[58:34] ministry what is this ministry right now
[58:36] for we have different stages that we go
[58:41] through brother brandham says here that
[58:43] in God's gifts always find their place
[58:46] he says when you realize what are we
[58:48] doing here where do we come from or what
[58:50] business we got here we wasn't put here
[58:53] by chance we was put here for purpose
[58:57] and we must serve that purpose but still
[58:59] we got to go back on the free on the
[59:02] basis of free moral agency where we can
[59:04] either serve it or reject it like Adam
[59:08] did in the beginning you're put upon
[59:11] this free moral agency you see God and
[59:15] it's another sermon in itself a free
[59:17] moral agency that you're placed here on
[59:19] Earth under the basis of free moral
[59:22] agency that you know God brother brandom
[59:24] says God would be unjust just to create
[59:26] a plan just to be a sa you know make a
[59:29] man to fall on purpose and then him
[59:31] redeem it so what did he have to do he
[59:32] had to create a man put him on the basis
[59:35] of free moral agency but he knew that
[59:37] the man would
[59:39] fall for go how could God do all the
[59:42] different things and express his
[59:44] attributes how could he do that without
[59:47] the on the basis of free moral
[59:50] agency and so we see that our ministry
[59:53] can change as we go through life brother
[59:55] Brandon 's uh Ministry changed and as I
[59:58] I listen to the sermon of present uh the
[1:00:00] present stage of his ministry he would
[1:00:03] begin to talk and he would we know the
[1:00:05] story of how he would he would have a
[1:00:07] vision and you know his life was going
[1:00:10] in a certain way and when he woke up he
[1:00:13] I believe is the Angel of the Lord or
[1:00:15] you know something came to him and said
[1:00:17] go to Second Timothy 4 verse one and so
[1:00:20] we know that scripture was preach the
[1:00:22] word be instant
[1:00:24] inseason reprove rebuke do all these
[1:00:27] things right and he gets to verse five
[1:00:31] because he always says that I always
[1:00:32] stop at verse five he says I always stop
[1:00:36] there because he says but watch thou in
[1:00:39] all things endure afflictions and do the
[1:00:41] work in of of an evangelist and make
[1:00:43] full proof of thy Ministry and so
[1:00:46] whenever he was in the beginning parts
[1:00:48] of his ministry he always stopped there
[1:00:51] so because the denominations wanted him
[1:00:53] everybody wanted him everybody didn't
[1:00:55] wanted the healing everyone wanted all
[1:00:57] the first and second
[1:00:59] pools they wanted all those emotions all
[1:01:02] the gifts of
[1:01:04] it and so brother Brandon would say that
[1:01:07] was the beginning part of my Ministry
[1:01:09] and I always stopped at at verse 5
[1:01:11] because I thought that that's what I was
[1:01:13] fulfilling and he was fulfilling that
[1:01:16] portion of scripture but then we get to
[1:01:18] uh 1962 when brother brandom says the
[1:01:21] present stage of my Ministry you see
[1:01:23] something change he says why don't you
[1:01:25] go a little further her and he began to
[1:01:27] see that you know the the angel stop
[1:01:30] messing the first and second pool and he
[1:01:32] said stop trying to explain everything
[1:01:34] to everybody stop trying to explain it
[1:01:37] and try to get people to understand it
[1:01:39] he says I don't have any secrets so he's
[1:01:42] trying to get all these ones to
[1:01:44] understand it but it's not for everybody
[1:01:46] it's for an individual it's for an elect
[1:01:49] lady and so he comes to this portion of
[1:01:52] his ministry and it begins to change and
[1:01:55] he would take in the sermon it's good
[1:01:56] for us to go and listen present stage of
[1:01:58] his ministry and he begins to type it as
[1:02:01] he goes on Paul is talking about all the
[1:02:03] ones that begin to walk away why because
[1:02:06] Paul you know uh Deus would come unto
[1:02:09] Paul and he would say that you know he
[1:02:11] would walk away why because he would
[1:02:13] begin to love the
[1:02:15] world and that was in verse 10 he's uh
[1:02:19] that Deus would forsake Him having loved
[1:02:23] this present world and he would walk
[1:02:25] away brother brandom says you know he
[1:02:27] starts losing his friends and he starts
[1:02:29] get not getting invitations why because
[1:02:32] it was a changing of his ministry and he
[1:02:34] began to type at his Paul and he began
[1:02:37] to think that this old you know he be to
[1:02:39] get washed up and he he wasn't a part of
[1:02:41] the big revivals and he wasn't a part of
[1:02:43] all these you know uh uh uh things that
[1:02:45] were
[1:02:47] happening but yet God was just changing
[1:02:49] his ministry
[1:02:56] and there came a place in Paul's life
[1:02:59] that brother Brandon would say it was
[1:03:01] God that was the one that was causing
[1:03:03] the change of ministry he was causing
[1:03:06] things to come up people to leave
[1:03:08] because whenever you read verse six he
[1:03:10] was ready to be offered as a martyr and
[1:03:12] that was the greatest honor back then
[1:03:15] was to be offered as a martyr and Paul
[1:03:17] would say all has forsaken me and you
[1:03:20] know when you listen to the sermon he
[1:03:22] would begin to talk about brother Baxter
[1:03:25] brother backer said whenever I get to
[1:03:27] heaven I'm going to punch o uh Deus for
[1:03:29] leaving that Prophet because he felt
[1:03:32] sorry for him he's like I don't agree
[1:03:34] with that but you know that that's just
[1:03:35] what he
[1:03:36] felt but he's like how could he walk
[1:03:39] away from a god-called man a prophet
[1:03:42] ones that signs and follows and wonders
[1:03:44] followed this man let me ask you how are
[1:03:46] ones walking away from this message
[1:03:48] right now how are they walking away it's
[1:03:50] a Vindicated word of God that's coming
[1:03:53] this day
[1:03:55] and yet people are walking away why
[1:03:58] because it's not for
[1:04:00] him it's not for
[1:04:07] him and on that basis of free moral
[1:04:10] agency we see because God always puts us
[1:04:13] in that and he says on the God of this
[1:04:16] evil age he says now we see the church
[1:04:18] refused to accept God's word to rule
[1:04:21] over them they accepted barabus instead
[1:04:25] he says now now we all believe that
[1:04:26] because we're looking back to see what
[1:04:28] happened it's easy to look
[1:04:30] back it's easy to look back and see how
[1:04:34] let me ask you that how do people when
[1:04:36] the prophet was on this you know in this
[1:04:38] earth and he was going and preaching
[1:04:40] conventions and stuff you would say oh I
[1:04:42] would travel right along with them I
[1:04:44] would be doing everything I can to catch
[1:04:47] those meetings but let me ask
[1:04:50] you what about now what about the
[1:04:53] ministry now are we being faithful in
[1:04:56] our ministry coming to church on
[1:04:58] Wednesdays and Sundays showing oursel
[1:05:00] faithful because what you can talk about
[1:05:03] what you would have done then but what
[1:05:04] are you doing now because what you're
[1:05:06] doing now is a reflection of what you
[1:05:08] would do
[1:05:11] then he says because but if the world
[1:05:14] would have that is now this pre uh
[1:05:16] present evil age that would have been
[1:05:19] back there at that time they would do
[1:05:22] the same thing they're doing today
[1:05:23] because it's still the same word for
[1:05:25] this age being manifest he'll do it he
[1:05:28] says they can't do nothing else they are
[1:05:31] children of disobedient given to a
[1:05:33] delusion to a lie to believe a lie and
[1:05:36] to be damned by
[1:05:38] it what you what they would have done
[1:05:41] now it's easy to look back and say oh I
[1:05:44] would have done this and I would have
[1:05:45] followed Jesus and I would have sat at
[1:05:47] his feet but let me ask you are you
[1:05:49] sitting at his feet
[1:05:52] tonight and I believe you are you're in
[1:05:54] the house of God you can be out doing
[1:05:56] something else you can be out partying
[1:05:58] you can be doing all kinds of other
[1:06:00] things ushering in the new year but yet
[1:06:02] you're here in the house of
[1:06:11] God and in that same
[1:06:14] sermon he begins to talk about a a
[1:06:18] deacon he said this Deacon came to him
[1:06:21] brother Tony came to him and he had a
[1:06:23] dream and this this one hit home just in
[1:06:26] the way that he told it because he was
[1:06:29] talking about this Deacon and he had a
[1:06:30] dream and he came to brother bradam and
[1:06:32] he said this man has come unto me and he
[1:06:34] said and he says I had this dream and I
[1:06:36] don't know what it means and he comes
[1:06:38] and he says I was dreaming and I came to
[1:06:41] a man and he was wearing a black coat
[1:06:42] and he was reading books and he says I'm
[1:06:45] trying to find my way to heaven can you
[1:06:48] help me and this man says go on to the
[1:06:50] next man and so he goes on to the next
[1:06:52] man and it was a man he was wearing
[1:06:54] another black coat and he was singing
[1:06:56] songs and he says I'm trying to find my
[1:06:58] way to heaven how do I get there and he
[1:07:01] says there's a man up on the hill and he
[1:07:04] brother brandom says he was it was a man
[1:07:05] wearing overalls he says sometimes God
[1:07:07] sends men and it's not on the outside
[1:07:10] because a lot of people think the way
[1:07:12] they're dressed or the bigger the church
[1:07:13] that God's got to be in that church let
[1:07:16] me tell you he's not in the big building
[1:07:18] he it doesn't matter it can be some
[1:07:20] small church God doesn't change
[1:07:25] and so he says there was a man up in the
[1:07:27] overalls and he gets up there and he
[1:07:29] says I'm trying to find brother brand
[1:07:30] I'm trying to find my way to heaven and
[1:07:33] he says I can walk with you for so long
[1:07:36] but then I got to leave you and there's
[1:07:37] a Wilderness out there and he says well
[1:07:39] how will I know where to go and he says
[1:07:42] follow the bloody
[1:07:44] Footprints he says follow the bloody
[1:07:46] Footprints and as I've heard that story
[1:07:48] something spoke to me and says of the
[1:07:50] books will only take you so far and
[1:07:52] worship and praise can only take you so
[1:07:55] far and you get to the prophet and he's
[1:07:57] going to walk with you and he's going to
[1:07:58] show you but let me tell you he's going
[1:08:00] to lead you back to the Cross he's going
[1:08:02] to tell you to follow those bloody
[1:08:06] footprints that chist shed at Calvary
[1:08:08] and if a man tells you another way leave
[1:08:11] that
[1:08:19] man present stage of my Ministry my time
[1:08:22] is up
[1:08:25] he says how many Christians are in the
[1:08:27] way tonight how many's in the way
[1:08:30] tonight he says in here he says that are
[1:08:32] happy you started a long time ago he
[1:08:35] said done made your start and way down

[1:18:48] Year 20124 may your grace and love be
[1:18:51] with us and carry us along the way as we
[1:18:54] ask pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you
[1:18:58] may be
[1:18:59] seated uh want to uh take the privilege
[1:19:02] to uh the opportunity I mean to thank
[1:19:05] brother Ron uh and also the church for
[1:19:11] the um your support as uh I said it last
[1:19:16] time that uh my next time here I'll be a
[1:19:19] married man but God's grace and uh you
[1:19:24] have made it possible may God richly
[1:19:28] bless you everyone uh I can call
[1:19:31] people's names because if I call one I
[1:19:34] have to call
[1:19:35] everybody uh each one of you have been
[1:19:39] uh in a form or another uh been there
[1:19:42] able to assist us uh along that
[1:19:45] transition uh some of you didn't want me
[1:19:48] to know but the Lord made it possible
[1:19:51] for me to know that you did help may God
[1:19:53] bless you all the
[1:19:55] effort uh for tonight ID like to take um
[1:20:01] just probably have that as an
[1:20:03] introduction but I've seen the Lord
[1:20:06] leading already uh he's uh keeping the
[1:20:09] church remembrance of the things that we
[1:20:12] know already and uh the things that we
[1:20:15] are acquainted for and especially the
[1:20:18] time in which uh we are living in uh in
[1:20:21] all the types and shadows that we see
[1:20:24] out of the Bible and heart of the
[1:20:26] message is to keep us focused uh to keep
[1:20:30] our eyes straight on the goal uh as uh
[1:20:34] we seeing here um I'll probably speak on
[1:20:38] uh just for these few minutes on what
[1:20:41] house will thou build me we know that
[1:20:44] the prophet has uh spoken about this
[1:20:46] message in such a termal time in 65 in
[1:20:50] which he was uh almost cast out from all
[1:20:54] uh the surroundings as uh the brothers
[1:20:57] already projected it laying it out in
[1:20:59] the first pole second pole and arriving
[1:21:01] to to that stage and also uh as brother
[1:21:05] James spoke about your present stage of
[1:21:07] the ministry but then on this time I
[1:21:10] would like to speak on it on what house
[1:21:13] will thou build me because all of us are
[1:21:16] believers and we believe this and people
[1:21:19] are leaving the message and all these
[1:21:21] things that's fine but then what house
[1:21:24] will you built him because uh we see
[1:21:28] that uh the people of hold our fathers
[1:21:32] had a tabernacle of witness according to
[1:21:35] the prophet of the age that came down
[1:21:38] and gave them the pardon according to
[1:21:41] what he had seen and the people who had
[1:21:44] received it who had believed it because
[1:21:47] some people desired to remain back in
[1:21:50] Egypt and say well you know it's better
[1:21:53] for us to
[1:21:55] uh find ourself a leader here as we see
[1:21:58] continually in the world well we can do
[1:22:01] this and we can uh have our own
[1:22:04] messenger the eighth one and all these
[1:22:06] kind of things but then my focus now is
[1:22:09] narrowed in only to the Believers what
[1:22:12] house will you build him because uh as
[1:22:16] the Tabernacle you see God's program is
[1:22:19] laid out that from the prophet of God
[1:22:22] who was uh for told in Genesis 15
[1:22:26] because we see from Genesis 15 uh God
[1:22:30] came to his prophet Abraham talking to
[1:22:33] him from Genesis 14 uh 15 uh 13 and 14
[1:22:38] it's almost a thousand years in that
[1:22:41] Thousand Years God said your seed shall
[1:22:44] possess this land and shall possess the
[1:22:47] Gate of the enemy and uh that seed will
[1:22:50] be in a stranger land but I'll bring
[1:22:53] them out with a mighty hand with great
[1:22:56] riches and we see from Genesis 15 all
[1:22:59] the way to Exodus 3 It's A Thousand
[1:23:03] Years brother Bram shows us uh or the
[1:23:07] Bible shows us that Abraham lived for
[1:23:10] about 175 years Isaac came along and
[1:23:13] lived with uh his wife almost UH 60
[1:23:17] years without having children and uh we
[1:23:20] can see Jacob coming to be born uh then
[1:23:25] Joseph come to go down in uh Egypt and
[1:23:29] all these years 130 years that Egypt uh
[1:23:32] um um Joseph lived there and for about
[1:23:36] 400 years that they were in slavery when
[1:23:39] you account for all those years you see
[1:23:42] that God said one thing the prophet
[1:23:44] preached the word and told us about all
[1:23:47] these prophecies and yet people have
[1:23:50] enough reasons today to say we have uh
[1:23:53] that the prophet is is not a true
[1:23:56] Prophet but then remember Abraham God
[1:23:59] spoke to him and told him that this is
[1:24:03] going to happen but it took a thousand
[1:24:07] years Daniel received the
[1:24:11] vision people had seen him that uh he
[1:24:14] challenged the king the faith of the
[1:24:16] king and everything the decree of the
[1:24:18] king and at the end of the day you find
[1:24:21] himself
[1:24:22] that all the rest of the Jew
[1:24:26] left but it was only three people that
[1:24:29] remained with the word in those days and
[1:24:31] people who had access to Daniel's
[1:24:35] Vision they could have had all the
[1:24:38] reason to tell Daniel that your prophecy
[1:24:41] is
[1:24:41] wrong because they didn't see the days
[1:24:44] of the coming of the head the
[1:24:47] stone and today people are looking for
[1:24:50] the same thing brother Bram did this we
[1:24:52] can give him credit for all the miracle
[1:24:54] and all this and all that but this
[1:24:57] didn't happen that means that he the
[1:24:59] false
[1:25:01] prophet but then here the Bible says in
[1:25:04] the book of Acts that our fathers
[1:25:07] received according to
[1:25:09] Moses we have received the message
[1:25:12] according to brother
[1:25:14] Brandon then to make that Tabernacle
[1:25:18] according to the fashion that he has
[1:25:20] seen there then now the question is to
[1:25:23] us now who have received in like manner
[1:25:27] what house shall we build
[1:25:30] him we are not after them who have
[1:25:33] backed and went back and stuff but now
[1:25:37] the possession now is in our
[1:25:39] hands because after Moses has died
[1:25:42] Joshua took the people he said rise up
[1:25:45] and you shall take them with you in the
[1:25:48] land according to the prophecy of
[1:25:50] Genesis
[1:25:53] 15 Joshua had never seen
[1:25:56] Abraham he had just read Abraham out of
[1:25:59] the books some of us have not seen
[1:26:02] brother Bram we just reading him out of
[1:26:05] the books and hearing him out of the
[1:26:07] tapes so then after receiving all that
[1:26:11] all those books what house are we going
[1:26:13] to
[1:26:15] build because the Tabernacle in the
[1:26:17] wilderness was made out of three
[1:26:20] parts the utter quotes what we see
[1:26:24] the inner coat that we cannot see and
[1:26:27] the holy of holies that only you know
[1:26:31] what's in there and out of the three
[1:26:34] play top parts of the Tabernacle what
[1:26:37] how are we building
[1:26:39] it because we can dress however we want
[1:26:43] or we can be like coren D in the
[1:26:46] wilderness well brother Bram say this
[1:26:48] well it's not really according to that I
[1:26:50] think according to my
[1:26:52] interpretation but he said
[1:26:55] make it according to the fashion as you
[1:26:58] had seen up there and now to you bride
[1:27:02] of Jesus Christ what house will you
[1:27:05] build
[1:27:06] him because brother Brenham is showing
[1:27:09] us here in
[1:27:12] the uh says Church ages Church ages book
[1:27:17] in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:27:25] because
[1:27:26] as
[1:27:28] Moses or Abraham had received the talk
[1:27:32] with God God spoke to him mouth to mouth
[1:27:35] and he to
[1:27:36] hear he received what he had received
[1:27:39] and he made it available to the
[1:27:42] people but Bram says the time is at hand
[1:27:46] the time was not at end previously
[1:27:49] certain things were not to be made
[1:27:51] manifest yet in the wisdom an economy of
[1:27:55] God this Mighty Revelation though fully
[1:27:59] known to God like Abraham God had known
[1:28:04] everything but he just gave him a little
[1:28:06] bit of
[1:28:07] information could not could not come for
[1:28:10] here through thus we immediately uh
[1:28:14] immediately learn a principle the
[1:28:15] revelation of God for each age can come
[1:28:19] in that age
[1:28:21] alone each one of us in the the present
[1:28:24] stage of our ministry that revelation
[1:28:27] will come at the appointed time for that
[1:28:30] part of the
[1:28:32] ministry look at history of Israel what
[1:28:36] I just pointed to us the revelation of
[1:28:38] God to Moses came only at a specific
[1:28:41] time of history and even more
[1:28:44] specifically it came as the people cried
[1:28:47] out to to God Jesus himself came to the
[1:28:51] fullness of time he being a complete
[1:28:54] revelation of godhead and in this age
[1:28:57] lean the revelation of God will come in
[1:29:01] its due
[1:29:02] time it will not
[1:29:04] falter neither will it be
[1:29:07] premature think of this and heit it well
[1:29:12] for we are in the end time
[1:29:15] today everything that we are doing
[1:29:18] according to the fashion do you have
[1:29:21] access to the
[1:29:22] revelation we are turning the page 2024
[1:29:26] is
[1:29:27] done changing status and from single to
[1:29:31] married and sick and being healed and
[1:29:35] being uh born again and all these
[1:29:38] things but then now how are you going to
[1:29:41] build
[1:29:42] it I Believe by God's grace we will go
[1:29:45] into more details but this just an
[1:29:48] overview of how are we going to build
[1:29:51] this
[1:29:52] Tabernacle because this
[1:29:54] Tabernacle because the almighty has made
[1:29:58] all these things we go we take a piece
[1:30:01] of food we make the propriate out of it
[1:30:03] we build a beautiful Tabernacle but God
[1:30:06] does not dwell in things made out of
[1:30:09] man's hand but he's seeking a place to
[1:30:13] of race but then that place of race is
[1:30:16] he told Moses according to the
[1:30:20] pattern not according to my own ideas my
[1:30:23] own interpretation of things well you
[1:30:25] know we becoming reformers now you know
[1:30:29] oh this brother did this in his wedding
[1:30:31] and I'll do this here this one did this
[1:30:34] in in his home and my wife will be this
[1:30:37] way no we are not called to be
[1:30:40] reformers we are not called to be
[1:30:42] following others or following the trend
[1:30:45] it is 2024 no no no no no according to
[1:30:48] the
[1:30:49] fashion because he has called e seed to
[1:30:54] fulfill his purpose and that purpose now
[1:30:58] the people now out to go to Moses and
[1:31:00] said give us the
[1:31:02] pon give us the book and he is
[1:31:05] revelation 10 it says that the voice
[1:31:08] that I heard spoke to me go to the angel
[1:31:11] take the book eat the book after eating
[1:31:13] the book do what sit them no
[1:31:18] prophesies the present stage of our
[1:31:22] ministry and if this ministry has been
[1:31:25] given to us we are to
[1:31:29] labor because the time had not
[1:31:32] previously there there was a time that
[1:31:36] Bram says in the church ages book it
[1:31:39] says that you know God did not fulfill
[1:31:41] certain things but he left them for you
[1:31:44] and I to
[1:31:46] do because when you looking the whole
[1:31:49] history of Israel in the world in Egypt
[1:31:53] God had Place events around them that
[1:31:57] will push them to cry out to him that
[1:32:00] will lead them all the way into the
[1:32:03] Wilderness in order to fulfill what he
[1:32:05] had spoken to Abraham
[1:32:09] about brother abam says in the message
[1:32:12] what house will thou build me he said
[1:32:14] hey I old I had already uh uh promise to
[1:32:19] the brother of Tabernacle that if
[1:32:20] there's anything new that God will give
[1:32:24] to me I'll come back here and preach it
[1:32:28] but in which house will thou build me it
[1:32:30] says like you know now I don't need I
[1:32:32] don't need to go back again to
[1:32:34] Jeffersonville I can walk up here
[1:32:37] according to Revelation that God has
[1:32:39] given to perigrine in order now I can
[1:32:42] just come up here and then deliver the
[1:32:44] message Hallelujah but God does not
[1:32:47] dwell in homes buildings made of
[1:32:52] men if go God had to profess a message
[1:32:57] today if God had to display a sons and
[1:33:00] daughter of God today he doesn't need to
[1:33:03] bring some people from Africa or
[1:33:05] somewhere out there he must have a home
[1:33:09] that is ready for
[1:33:11] him he must have people who are ready
[1:33:14] somewhere out there at work at home at
[1:33:19] the
[1:33:20] workplace a tabernacle ready whereby he
[1:33:23] can come and manifest that but then our
[1:33:27] outer Court our inner court and the holy
[1:33:31] of holies must be according to the
[1:33:34] fashion because if it's not according to
[1:33:36] the fashion then what is it
[1:33:41] after because God's program in Act 7 as
[1:33:44] we just seen it started all the way
[1:33:48] until David and then the Millennium that
[1:33:51] had to be built the type of the Millen
[1:33:55] because everything that we are building
[1:33:57] in our Earthly journey is a foreshadow
[1:34:01] of what our Millennium should look
[1:34:04] like because if it's our PN is after
[1:34:08] what the world wants us to
[1:34:12] have then God will look at us say no no
[1:34:15] no no no the material that I gave to
[1:34:19] David to gather in order to build and
[1:34:22] get ready for the millennium
[1:34:24] if it doesn't mat this cannot get up
[1:34:28] there if you can't have long hair here
[1:34:30] you can't have longer
[1:34:33] there it's according to the
[1:34:35] pattern if you can be humble here you
[1:34:38] can be humble over
[1:34:40] there if you can sit in the congregation
[1:34:42] of the Saints here you can sit in the
[1:34:45] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus it has
[1:34:48] to be done according to the
[1:34:51] pardon if I can't make it to every
[1:34:53] service that means that you know I can
[1:34:55] be there every day either because the
[1:34:58] Devils were making there time to time he
[1:35:01] comes where you from I was roaming the
[1:35:02] Earth and then after that he
[1:35:05] gone it is the same church the same way
[1:35:08] with church
[1:35:11] attendance what house will you build
[1:35:15] me what
[1:35:18] house are we bringing in in our
[1:35:21] ministry whereby we stand and we looking
[1:35:25] and we are working we are gathering the
[1:35:27] materials we are putting them together
[1:35:30] according to what Parn according to what
[1:35:33] fashion according to what
[1:35:37] Vision because the vision is not just
[1:35:40] you know I'm a Believer I want back of
[1:35:43] light no he wants something to be
[1:35:46] done and has it been done now each one
[1:35:49] of us according these three layers we
[1:35:53] are to to
[1:35:54] work because if uh a brother has to tell
[1:35:57] you oh you have to come to
[1:35:59] church we're not at that stage
[1:36:03] anymore after we have heard all these
[1:36:07] messages I believe like you know this
[1:36:10] will help
[1:36:11] us as I seen the spirit moving among the
[1:36:14] brothers who came before me he pointing
[1:36:18] us to the same
[1:36:21] thing because if we had known each other
[1:36:24] like you know what are you going to
[1:36:25] preach what are you going to say that's
[1:36:27] a human-made thing but when you look and
[1:36:30] you see the move of the
[1:36:33] spirit and brother Bram says
[1:36:36] here uh to finish up in this uh prayer a
[1:36:40] thankful prayer that he was uh making
[1:36:44] and it's uh you can listen to it at home
[1:36:46] if you want God's grace is a very small
[1:36:50] uh three minute prayer the whole tape is
[1:36:52] 3 minutes anyway
[1:36:54] um brother BR I'm being grateful to the
[1:36:56] Lord about everything that he has uh he
[1:37:00] has been for for him and uh for the
[1:37:03] entire church and uh this is also my
[1:37:05] prayer for us all together as the family

[1:51:03] evening I just want to take this little
[1:51:05] moment to thank the
[1:51:08] Lord who has protected us for this year
[1:51:11] that is
[1:51:12] finishing against sicknesses and
[1:51:15] hardship that we went
[1:51:16] through uh especially myself I can say
[1:51:19] my health was not that good for this
[1:51:21] year
[1:51:23] but the Lord that is always giving us
[1:51:25] Victory stood to my side and to our side
[1:51:29] and and tonight we can thank
[1:51:32] him my thanks go so goes to brother Ron
[1:51:35] our
[1:51:36] pastor you know sometimes it takes uh a
[1:51:41] discovery from yourself to know to get
[1:51:43] to know some somebody you don't need to
[1:51:45] hear from someone else but you need to
[1:51:47] get to know the person
[1:51:50] yourself I got to learn and uh know
[1:51:54] brother Ron the spirit he has and you
[1:51:57] can tell even that spirit in the
[1:52:01] church I can say he's my
[1:52:05] mentor I'm proud to say that because
[1:52:07] he's a guiding me and uh showing me the
[1:52:11] way in a good Pathway to
[1:52:15] follow I have a little thought tonight
[1:52:18] when I saw brother Ron sending the
[1:52:20] message to all of us ministers saying
[1:52:23] if you have something we need you to
[1:52:25] come with something some vision for the
[1:52:27] church for your families and for the
[1:52:30] bride in general right away your thought
[1:52:33] came to my
[1:52:35] mind walk with
[1:52:39] God a closer walk with God that's the
[1:52:42] title of my little sermon this
[1:52:46] evening you know brother bam says we are
[1:52:48] living in the age
[1:52:50] where Satan's power is tougher to
[1:52:55] fight we're living in the age where
[1:52:57] demons are being turned loose on the
[1:53:00] earth we are living in the age where
[1:53:04] hell which is the other
[1:53:06] dimension is not there in that sixth
[1:53:09] Dimension but it's
[1:53:12] here let me tell you you know you are
[1:53:14] robbing your shoulders with those that
[1:53:16] are going to different direction than
[1:53:18] you walking in the
[1:53:20] stores walking on the Street you are
[1:53:23] robbing your shoulders with those that
[1:53:25] would be totally different Direction
[1:53:27] with
[1:53:29] you but we believe we are the
[1:53:32] people that will see the end
[1:53:36] time because we read here seven times
[1:53:40] from Adam from the first Adam we read
[1:53:43] six times and he died six times and he
[1:53:47] died but the seventh
[1:53:50] time Enoch walked with with God and he
[1:53:54] was not for God took
[1:53:57] him as I said my title is closer walk
[1:54:01] with
[1:54:02] God we don't have to pretend to have
[1:54:05] walked with him but we need to make sure
[1:54:08] we are walking truly with
[1:54:11] him and my Visions for this church and
[1:54:15] for the bride in general we need a
[1:54:17] closer walk with God am you know when
[1:54:21] Enoch was was seeing his days dwindling
[1:54:24] or going away he start walking closer to
[1:54:30] God and at the end of his this
[1:54:33] walk God took
[1:54:35] him in other words to C off this walk
[1:54:38] with God the Rapture took
[1:54:42] place so as is the
[1:54:45] seventh the seven churches from the
[1:54:47] second Adam which is Jesus Christ we
[1:54:50] need to keep in mind that we are the
[1:54:52] people that will see the Rapture taking
[1:54:54] place I know we have two ways to live
[1:54:57] this Earth either it's by the way of
[1:54:59] death or by the way of
[1:55:02] rapture either way we are the seventh to
[1:55:06] see the end time happening in our
[1:55:09] eyes and as such we need to have a
[1:55:12] closer walk with
[1:55:13] God
[1:55:16] otherwise you'll be backsliding like
[1:55:19] many others have done these last past
[1:55:23] many
[1:55:25] years we've seen people walking away
[1:55:27] from the
[1:55:29] message we've seen people
[1:55:32] backsliding not only the Believers but
[1:55:34] we've seen
[1:55:36] ministers those that have stood and took
[1:55:38] side of Jesus preaching in deep messages
[1:55:44] backsliding leaving this
[1:55:46] message my question was did they walk
[1:55:49] truly with God or they pretended to have
[1:55:51] walked with God
[1:55:54] God you go in the Bible you see Mary and
[1:55:59] Joseph is the Jewish people they used to
[1:56:01] have the Habit to go every year to the
[1:56:03] temple in Jerusalem for the Passover
[1:56:07] Festival after they
[1:56:10] finish the festivities they were going
[1:56:13] back
[1:56:14] home but they walked the Bible says they
[1:56:17] walked one day pretending that they have
[1:56:19] Jesus but they didn't have him he stay
[1:56:22] in the temple talking about the father's
[1:56:25] business it took one day for them to
[1:56:28] realize that he was not with
[1:56:31] them you don't want to do such a thing
[1:56:35] like Joseph and Mary did don't pretend
[1:56:38] to have him but make sure you have
[1:56:43] him that's why tonight we need to talk
[1:56:46] about the closer walk with
[1:56:50] God you know when Elijah was about to be
[1:56:53] taken off this
[1:56:56] Earth Elisha was kind of walking closer
[1:57:00] to
[1:57:01] him because the Days of Elijah was
[1:57:05] numbered and he had a closer walk with
[1:57:08] him to have a double portion of what
[1:57:11] Elijah
[1:57:12] had because Elijah has was scheduled to
[1:57:15] be taken off of this
[1:57:16] Earth and Elisha walked closer to him
[1:57:23] we have
[1:57:25] another group of Believers that walked
[1:57:27] with
[1:57:30] Jesus we have cleopas and his
[1:57:35] friend they walked with him and had the
[1:57:39] questions about the promise of that
[1:57:42] hour but it took a walk with God for
[1:57:46] them to have the clear understanding of
[1:57:48] what had taken place because they were
[1:57:52] debating between he was he reison or was
[1:57:55] was he was not
[1:57:56] reason because this is the resurrection
[1:57:59] day they had a question about the event
[1:58:01] of the day they have a question about
[1:58:04] the promise of that hour it took Jesus
[1:58:08] to draw night to them and start walking
[1:58:11] with them and teaching to them about the
[1:58:14] promise of the
[1:58:17] hour we heard about Steven saying the
[1:58:20] other day when he preached about when he
[1:58:22] preached and he talked about us reading
[1:58:25] the message us getting into the message
[1:58:27] to read there's no restriction for the
[1:58:30] Believers to go into the message and dig
[1:58:32] deep read and get close to the
[1:58:35] Jesus so for them to
[1:58:39] know what took place in that time they
[1:58:42] had to have a walk with
[1:58:45] Jesus Jesus doesn't presented himself
[1:58:48] like here I
[1:58:50] am I'm the one that has reason no he
[1:58:53] takes you to the
[1:58:55] scriptures the Bible says he start with
[1:58:59] Moses up to the prophets of that hour
[1:59:02] concerning his
[1:59:04] resurrection he said why are you so slow
[1:59:07] to believe what the prophet have
[1:59:12] said he doesn't present himself like
[1:59:14] that he has to take you through the word
[1:59:17] in other word he was vindicating those
[1:59:19] prophets saying what they have said
[1:59:22] was
[1:59:23] true and you have to see it now for I'm
[1:59:29] reason you and I have believed the
[1:59:31] message of a prophet that has been
[1:59:36] Vindicated I can say like bam was
[1:59:38] dramatizing when he was talking about
[1:59:40] Jesus descending in
[1:59:42] hell he say even there he Vindicated the
[1:59:45] prophets because he told the
[1:59:47] non-believers why didn't you believe
[1:59:50] Enoch because what whatever he
[1:59:53] said he was talking about me why didn't
[1:59:56] you believe such a prophet he was
[1:59:58] vindicating
[2:00:00] them on the time of those disciples he
[2:00:02] was vindicating the prophets that have
[2:00:04] prophesied about his
[2:00:06] resurrection and in the days we are
[2:00:08] living in we saw the same God
[2:00:11] vindicating the prophet Hallelujah you
[2:00:13] saw the pillow fire on the top of the
[2:00:15] Prophet you saw how many times God has
[2:00:18] drawn n to him to vindicate the ministry
[2:00:21] that we are believing
[2:00:24] it takes a closer walk with
[2:00:26] God and you know as the children of
[2:00:31] Abraham copas and his friend when they
[2:00:33] heard when he was preaching to them
[2:00:35] Jesus was talking to them they didn't
[2:00:37] want to let him go because something was
[2:00:40] burning in their heart they grabbed him
[2:00:43] they say stay with us
[2:00:48] here as is the
[2:00:50] Believers believing the same Jesus
[2:00:53] believing the same
[2:00:54] God is our Father Abraham we have a such
[2:00:58] a ministry here that has the word of
[2:01:02] God we should cling to him
[2:01:07] amen because he's sending us and
[2:01:09] pointing us to Jesus
[2:01:11] Christ a Ministry that is drifting us
[2:01:14] away from Jesus Christ we should stay
[2:01:16] away from that but the one that is
[2:01:18] pointing us to Christ we should cling
[2:01:27] because the time we are living in it's a
[2:01:29] very CR of time it's not the time that
[2:01:32] you need to walk by
[2:01:34] yourself it's the time that you need a
[2:01:36] closer walk with
[2:01:40] God Enoch didn't walk with God like a
[2:01:42] human being walking there and him as a
[2:01:45] human being working here God was in
[2:01:49] him and what whatam says if did not
[2:01:53] doubt the word of God whatever God God
[2:01:56] say to him he believed it so as a
[2:02:00] Believer we don't have to like bam says
[2:02:02] when you believe don't put a full stop
[2:02:05] put a CA because the Revelation is
[2:02:09] evolving God might show you something
[2:02:11] more than you have have not seen before
[2:02:15] what you going to do most
[2:02:19] people because the time we living in
[2:02:21] it's like it's compared to the time of
[2:02:23] the judges before the prophet samel
[2:02:26] where everybody was doing things
[2:02:28] according to their own
[2:02:30] dictate as if there was not Prophet
[2:02:32] truly there was not Prophet at that time
[2:02:35] but we here we are living in the days of
[2:02:38] the voice of the seventh angel
[2:02:41] Hallelujah we cannot behave as such we
[2:02:43] cannot behave as those in the ter of
[2:02:46] Judges doing things to our own
[2:02:50] dictate that will result result in
[2:02:53] backsliding that will result in false
[2:02:57] teaching because we're doing things
[2:02:59] according to our own
[2:03:01] dictate you take it the the you go back
[2:03:04] in the Bible in the time of uh
[2:03:07] David the ark should be brought back put
[2:03:10] on the shoulders of the
[2:03:12] priests but he did it according to the
[2:03:15] dictate of the
[2:03:17] population but the prophet was in the
[2:03:19] land Nathan was there heed to go consult
[2:03:22] and talk to the prophet he didn't do
[2:03:25] that as a result of that somebody
[2:03:31] died you see we don't live in the period
[2:03:34] like in the period of the the judges we
[2:03:36] are living in the time in the voice of
[2:03:39] the seventh angel you have any question
[2:03:42] we have the message book when you don't
[2:03:45] understand it the pastor is here as the
[2:03:46] prophet said go ask to your pastor if
[2:03:49] you don't understand or take your time
[2:03:52] pray God on his own time he will come
[2:03:55] and give the Revelation to
[2:03:56] you as long as you show the interest in
[2:03:59] the
[2:04:00] thing because the unique ethopian showed
[2:04:03] the interest in the thing he wanted to
[2:04:04] know who was the prophet talking about
[2:04:07] here God who knows our heart he sent the
[2:04:12] prophet Phillip go to The Chariot
[2:04:16] because he saw the need in the heart of
[2:04:18] the uniion if you do have the same needs
[2:04:23] the Mighty God is more than able to
[2:04:26] send his angels whether he's behind his
[2:04:29] Pulpit or you can talk to the pastor or
[2:04:32] one of the minister you can talk to them
[2:04:34] or fellowshipping with a brother who has
[2:04:36] a
[2:04:37] spirit he is a spirit filled a brother
[2:04:40] with a good Revelation can give you
[2:04:42] something because God sees the need in
[2:04:44] your heart we don't live in the days of
[2:04:47] the
[2:04:48] judges those days are gone we are living
[2:04:51] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:04:53] angel Hallelujah go to the message read
[2:04:55] yourself discover
[2:04:58] yourself it's the time where we need to
[2:05:00] live closer to God we don't have to
[2:05:03] pretend to live with him or to have him
[2:05:05] in our heart we need to make sure he's
[2:05:07] in our heart because he's the inside
[2:05:12] teacher closer walk with
[2:05:16] God Enoch didn't plan to leave this
[2:05:19] earth but it it it's up to God God to
[2:05:22] determine because the Bible says in
[2:05:24] Hebrews
[2:05:26] 11 Enoch pleased
[2:05:29] God how could he please God in other way
[2:05:34] than just believing his word because
[2:05:37] without faith you cannot please God and
[2:05:40] baram says whatever it takes for us to
[2:05:42] be taken away for the rapturing faith
[2:05:45] has been brought to
[2:05:48] us the same one who closed the book is
[2:05:51] the sameone who in this end time has
[2:05:53] opened the book and we don't read from a
[2:05:56] closed book we are reading from an open
[2:05:59] book we should be a happier people on
[2:06:02] this face of this Earth because we know
[2:06:04] where we're going let me shock you I
[2:06:08] told you earlier that you are rubbing
[2:06:10] your shoulders with people that will be
[2:06:11] going in different direction than
[2:06:14] you we you came in the family with the
[2:06:18] brothers and sisters in your family that
[2:06:20] will be going this different direction
[2:06:22] from
[2:06:25] you it's only the human blood that will
[2:06:28] keep you together but at the end you'll
[2:06:31] be going separate
[2:06:35] directions if the human blood can keep
[2:06:38] us United like that how much more the
[2:06:40] blood of Jesus
[2:06:42] Christ because you and I we're going to
[2:06:44] spend eternity together therefore
[2:06:46] eternity should be starting here you and
[2:06:49] I fellowshipping loving one another
[2:06:52] because we're going to spend the same
[2:06:53] eternity beyond the curtain of
[2:06:57] time don't pretend to have walked with
[2:07:00] God make sure you have him in your
[2:07:02] heart because one day or the other you
[2:07:04] see many people that have left the
[2:07:07] message they pretended to have walked
[2:07:09] with
[2:07:10] him they pretended to have God in their
[2:07:13] heart but look at the
[2:07:16] end look at the
[2:07:19] end this tells us that they didn't have
[2:07:22] him Joseph and Mary they took one day
[2:07:26] that's a lot 24 hours you even looking
[2:07:29] around where is my
[2:07:33] son many people are in the same
[2:07:35] conditions in this same
[2:07:37] time they pretend to have Jesus with
[2:07:41] them let me tell you you need a closer
[2:07:44] walk with Jesus for this coming year you
[2:07:47] have a the responsibility to make sure
[2:07:51] you have a Jesus in your
[2:07:55] heart don't pretend to have
[2:07:58] him make sure you have him
[2:08:01] because like I said this year was not
[2:08:03] easy for
[2:08:04] me even for many of us but there's not a
[2:08:08] promise saying that it's going to be
[2:08:11] easy in the time of Esther a decree went
[2:08:16] forth they sent a decree to kill all the
[2:08:19] Jewish people and when the was sent
[2:08:22] forth there's no way to reverse
[2:08:24] it because it's the decree of the king
[2:08:28] let me tell
[2:08:29] you the situations we are going through
[2:08:32] is going to be getting tougher and
[2:08:34] tougher but God will give us the means
[2:08:38] to overcome the
[2:08:39] situation because Esther she was given
[2:08:43] the scepter of the
[2:08:46] king and you and I have been given a
[2:08:48] scepter of the king Hallelujah if my
[2:08:52] words AB in you ask what you
[2:08:57] will because Esther she heard the sep of
[2:09:00] the
[2:09:00] king the king said even the half of my
[2:09:03] kingdom I give it to you am she was
[2:09:07] there for a
[2:09:08] purpose the Jews were sched to be wiped
[2:09:11] off the
[2:09:12] Earth but because of Esther and she had
[2:09:16] the SE of the the king she saved the
[2:09:18] life of many you not
[2:09:21] here in this message have hazly God has
[2:09:25] brought you to the message for a purpose
[2:09:28] you have family members your family your
[2:09:31] wife husbands brothers and sisters
[2:09:35] friends you have the scepter of the the
[2:09:38] king if my words abide in you ask what
[2:09:42] you
[2:09:44] will and Walking with God he should keep
[2:09:49] us humble
[2:09:53] because we need his grace and
[2:09:56] mercy because those that have
[2:09:58] backsliding today that are backsliding
[2:10:01] today you and I are not more than
[2:10:04] them it just takes the grace and mercy
[2:10:07] of
[2:10:08] God this will bring me to my second
[2:10:14] scripture it's going to be in the
[2:10:17] Corinthian chapter
[2:10:19] 12 verse 9
[2:10:23] 2 Corinthians
[2:10:27] 12:9 this is Paul talking he said and he
[2:10:29] said unto me my grace is sufficient for
[2:10:33] thee for my strength is made perfect in
[2:10:40] weaknesses that's my vision for this
[2:10:44] local church for my family for our
[2:10:48] pastor for all the brothers and sisters
[2:10:51] to remain
[2:10:53] humble to depend on his grace and mercy
[2:10:57] because this urge we are living in is
[2:10:59] tough to fight it takes God to our side
[2:11:02] to overcome
[2:11:04] it we're going through many things we
[2:11:07] don't need to walk alone we need a
[2:11:09] closer walk with him we want him in our
[2:11:11] heart in our subconscious we want to
[2:11:13] make sure he's in our heart because he
[2:11:15] said himself Lo I'll be with you even in
[2:11:19] you until the end of the time but want
[2:11:21] to make sure he's in us until the end of
[2:11:23] the time remember Billy one time he was
[2:11:27] thirsty night time and wanted to have a
[2:11:29] cup of water and then daddy told him go
[2:11:32] to the kitchen and get it no Dad I can't
[2:11:34] walk it's dark it took the prophet to
[2:11:37] hold the son the his son's hands to walk
[2:11:40] to walk with him until the
[2:11:42] kitchen it's dark in this end time gross
[2:11:47] Darkness upon people you don't need to
[2:11:49] walk on your own you you don't you don't
[2:11:51] need to walk with yourself you need to
[2:11:54] walk with him you need to make sure you
[2:11:56] have him in your heart otherwise you're
[2:11:58] not going to make
[2:12:01] it we don't fight with human beings we
[2:12:04] fight with spirit in Heavenly
[2:12:07] places it takes the one who knows the
[2:12:10] dimensions to teach us to show us the
[2:12:16] pathway butam says in this message
[2:12:24] in this message the are 10 virgins and
[2:12:29] 144,000
[2:12:31] Jews he said oh God May someday the
[2:12:37] church which is the type of Enoch 500
[2:12:40] years walked before God walking walking
[2:12:45] in the light with a testimony that
[2:12:49] everything God said he did it
[2:12:52] he did it he didn't displease
[2:12:54] him what the Lord said do Enoch done it
[2:12:59] now he was a type remember the AR is the
[2:13:04] type of the
[2:13:06] Jews the
[2:13:08] 144,000 that carried over which is Noah
[2:13:13] and his Bunch but Enoch went home just a
[2:13:17] little bit before the flood you know
[2:13:20] that
[2:13:21] so Enoch just kept walking in the
[2:13:24] light so one day he felt his feet
[2:13:28] getting off the ground he just kept
[2:13:32] walking and he
[2:13:34] walked on into Glory without even dying
[2:13:39] that's right God took him away because
[2:13:43] he was walking in the light with a
[2:13:46] testimony that he walked in the light of
[2:13:49] God kept walking
[2:13:53] walking you and I have received the
[2:13:56] message of the
[2:13:57] hour Vindicated by the god almighty God
[2:14:01] it's not something that a human being
[2:14:04] has brought to us God himself Vindicated
[2:14:07] this message and this is the lightam
[2:14:09] says in there is a man that can turn on
[2:14:11] the light he said the light is when the
[2:14:17] scripture is being fulfilled that's the
[2:14:22] light Malachi 4 is not a history for us
[2:14:26] Malachi 4 is not the future for us
[2:14:29] Malachi 4 is the
[2:14:30] reality we are walking in the
[2:14:33] light you know the scripture when it's
[2:14:35] not fulfilled it still be it still has
[2:14:38] to be
[2:14:39] questionable they can question it they
[2:14:42] can debate about it they can say okay
[2:14:44] you'll be fulfilled or has been
[2:14:47] fulfilled but when you see it fulfilled
[2:14:51] before your wondering eyes that's the
[2:14:55] light you and I are walking in the
[2:14:59] light and therefore we need to please
[2:15:03] God for him to take us home because
[2:15:07] living this Earth doesn't depend on us
[2:15:09] it depends on him when he see you
[2:15:12] walking with him pleasing
[2:15:16] him then he will decide to take you
[2:15:19] remember the teaching
[2:15:21] about the dimensions or the
[2:15:24] kingdoms but R brought the other time
[2:15:28] same
[2:15:29] thing you can go into the other
[2:15:32] dimension or another kingdom on your
[2:15:35] own a power from there had to be brought
[2:15:39] to you for you to be taken
[2:15:42] up guess what he might delay he coming
[2:15:45] but he might not delay your
[2:15:48] going Hallelujah cuz I said we're going
[2:15:51] to leave this Earth We're Going to exit
[2:15:52] this Earth by two
[2:15:54] ways either it's by death or
[2:15:58] Rapture that's why I'm saying he might
[2:16:00] not delay your
[2:16:04] going you
[2:16:06] know it depends on him he's the one to
[2:16:10] appreciate your walking with
[2:16:12] him don't displease him by disbelieving

[2:18:53] somay God bless you this evening if you
[2:18:55] have your Bibles turn with me to the
[2:18:57] book of First Corinthians chapter 5 and
[2:19:00] we'll read verse 8 and while you're
[2:19:02] turning there I just want to say thank
[2:19:04] you brother Ron for another year of
[2:19:06] mentorship and also friendship I
[2:19:09] certainly appreciate it bless you thank
[2:19:11] you and God bless you also another year
[2:19:15] and here we are again and it's a good
[2:19:18] thing uh 1 Corinthians chapter 5 5 and
[2:19:21] verse 8 and it says therefore let us
[2:19:23] keep the feast not with old leaven
[2:19:26] neither with the leaven of malice and
[2:19:28] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[2:19:31] of sincerity and Truth amen you may be
[2:19:36] seated as I read one more scripture here
[2:19:39] it's found in the book of James chapter
[2:19:41] 5 and verse 17 and it says Elias was a
[2:19:45] man subject to like passions as we are
[2:19:48] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[2:19:50] not rain
[2:19:51] and it rained not on the Earth by the
[2:19:53] space of 3 years and 6 months I would
[2:19:57] like to speak just for a few moments
[2:19:58] tonight on uh being a little more
[2:20:03] sincere being a little more sincere and
[2:20:06] uh when obviously when brother Ron had
[2:20:08] sent the text out and I thought my what
[2:20:10] what is my vision for my family myself
[2:20:13] and so forth uh sincerity came to my
[2:20:16] heart and uh I think it's one of those
[2:20:19] things that all of us could do a little
[2:20:21] bit better with is being a little more
[2:20:23] sincere and if there was anybody that
[2:20:26] was ever uh probably the most sincere
[2:20:28] person that we've ever known outside of
[2:20:31] Jesus Christ would be brother brandham
[2:20:33] himself you know brother brandham he had
[2:20:35] these meetings in Durban South Africa
[2:20:37] and and and you know uh hundreds of
[2:20:40] thousands of converts and different
[2:20:42] things and many miracles and God doing
[2:20:44] many things in his life but yet uh he
[2:20:47] would get to a place and and he was
[2:20:48] sitting on his bed he put his hands
[2:20:50] behind his head and he said my uh uh I
[2:20:53] better hurry up and do something for the
[2:20:55] Lord because of yet I've done nothing
[2:20:57] for him and this s the sincerity of this
[2:21:00] man was uh was something else to say the
[2:21:04] to say the least and we see that in
[2:21:06] brother bram's life um there was there
[2:21:09] was this mountain range with Seven Peaks
[2:21:13] and uh these Seven Peaks really meant
[2:21:15] something to brother brandom and we
[2:21:18] understand that it was uh showing a type
[2:21:21] of his life and uh uh there was some
[2:21:25] high peaks and some low Peaks and there
[2:21:28] was some valleys and everything and I I
[2:21:31] I I got to thinking about this and I
[2:21:33] thought you know brother Brandon we have
[2:21:36] his life story and he was an open book
[2:21:38] before us and I'm just so very thankful
[2:21:41] that he was like that because a lot of
[2:21:44] times uh when we have valleys in our
[2:21:46] lives we think it's it's just us and we
[2:21:50] think that it's because of something
[2:21:52] that we've done wrong or that God is
[2:21:54] angry with us and he's not pleased with
[2:21:56] us but really uh if he kept us on a
[2:21:59] Mountaintop experience all the time our
[2:22:02] fruit would never grow and when we see
[2:22:05] the life of brother Brandon we realize
[2:22:07] ourselves that God takes us through
[2:22:09] valleys and mountaintops for a purpose
[2:22:12] and we see many things in brother bram's
[2:22:14] own life for instance of his wife and
[2:22:17] his baby daughter they're uh laying dead
[2:22:20] and and and uh before his daughter died
[2:22:22] he he said her pain was uh so great that
[2:22:26] her little eyes crossed over and he said
[2:22:29] whenever a little baby or a little kid
[2:22:31] would come through the prayer lines with
[2:22:33] crossed eyes that there would never be a
[2:22:35] one that their eyes would never be
[2:22:37] straightened again and it was because of
[2:22:39] the things that God brought brother
[2:22:41] brandham through uh the the trials of
[2:22:44] his life the the the refining of the
[2:22:47] gold in his life was for others that
[2:22:50] they May benefit from what he had went
[2:22:52] through and a lot of times we go through
[2:22:55] valleys and we go through mountaintops
[2:22:57] and a lot of the times we don't speak of
[2:23:00] going climbing from the valley to the
[2:23:03] Mountaintop The Climb sometimes is worse
[2:23:06] than the
[2:23:07] valley coming out of the valley and
[2:23:10] climbing the mountain sometimes is is
[2:23:12] the worst part of the whole journey it
[2:23:14] is for me anyways they say well uh I
[2:23:17] hiked to Grand Canyon with the brothers
[2:23:19] one time and and and they said well how
[2:23:21] did you enjoy the hike and I didn't
[2:23:23] enjoy it one bit because I was always
[2:23:25] looking at my feet it it wasn't
[2:23:27] enjoyable the scenery wasn't enjoyable
[2:23:30] because I had I just wanted to get to
[2:23:32] the top but when I got to the top I was
[2:23:34] happy I was happier in the valley than I
[2:23:37] was climbing the mountain but if you
[2:23:40] want to go from the valley to the
[2:23:41] mountain you've got to climb the
[2:23:43] mountain and so we've all been through
[2:23:46] many things this year but I want you to
[2:23:49] be encouraged that it's worth it
[2:23:52] all what does it mean to be sincere to
[2:23:55] be sincere it means to be free from
[2:23:57] pretense or deceit proceeding from
[2:24:01] genuine feelings so in other words being
[2:24:05] genuine means you're not being fake
[2:24:07] being genuine means uh you're you're a
[2:24:10] real Christian you're not pretending
[2:24:12] you're you're not pre pretending to love
[2:24:14] the Lord You're not pretending brother
[2:24:16] Freddy to walk with the Lord but being
[2:24:18] sincere it's it's genuine and it has a
[2:24:22] feeling with it it's not a feeling of
[2:24:24] some sort of um emotional makeup or some
[2:24:28] kind of feeling with uh uh uh you know
[2:24:33] uh Sensations and and emotions and
[2:24:35] tingling down your neck but a true
[2:24:38] genuine feeling for one another and when
[2:24:41] we have a true genuine feeling for one
[2:24:44] another and a true genuine feeling for
[2:24:47] God we will be sincere in our walk with
[2:24:50] God God am so we realize that uh brother
[2:24:55] brother martin alluded to it uh very
[2:24:58] briefly and I'll do the same thing um
[2:25:02] being more sincere we see that uh God
[2:25:05] told brother brandom and he said if
[2:25:07] you'll be sincere and you'll get to
[2:25:09] people to believe in you not even cancer
[2:25:12] will stand in your way and so we see
[2:25:15] that he would always say Do you believe
[2:25:17] me to be God's servant do you believe me
[2:25:19] to be God God's prophet and he he would
[2:25:21] say things like this because he was
[2:25:23] getting the people to believe in him
[2:25:26] because the angel had told him if you be
[2:25:28] sincere get the people to believe in you
[2:25:31] nothing will stand in your way and
[2:25:33] because he was sincere with the people
[2:25:35] he had a genuine feeling for the people
[2:25:38] he wanted them to believe in him so that
[2:25:41] they may get their requests answered
[2:25:43] before God now first pull we understand
[2:25:48] was a uh it was it was a pull of the
[2:25:50] flesh man it was a pull of the outward
[2:25:53] man where brother Brandon would take
[2:25:54] people by the hand and he would bump
[2:25:56] have little bumps and different things
[2:25:58] in his hand and he would be able to tell
[2:26:00] the people what was wrong and what
[2:26:02] condition they were in in their life but
[2:26:05] in order for him to go from the first to
[2:26:07] the second pool he had to be a little
[2:26:09] more sincere in his life and in his walk
[2:26:12] with God and so he went through the
[2:26:14] second pool which we understand is the
[2:26:17] discernment of the spirits which now it
[2:26:19] went from the outer Court to the inner
[2:26:22] Court which is the spirit man he was no
[2:26:25] longer just dealing with the flesh
[2:26:27] outward person but he would take
[2:26:29] somebody and he would discern their
[2:26:32] Spirits going a little deeper into their
[2:26:35] lives bringing something out and and it
[2:26:37] was all really for a purpose but in
[2:26:40] order for brother brandom to go from the
[2:26:42] first to the second pool he had to be
[2:26:44] more sincere in his life it was no
[2:26:46] different from when he would go from the
[2:26:48] second to the Third pool he was told you
[2:26:51] need to be a little more sincere so we
[2:26:55] go from the outer Court fleshman
[2:26:57] believer and brother brandham preaches a
[2:26:59] sermon why are people so too uh so
[2:27:02] tossed to and fro and he said the
[2:27:04] problem is too many people are outer
[2:27:06] Court Believers they've never entered
[2:27:08] into the holy place or to the inner
[2:27:11] Court uh outer Court Believers are
[2:27:14] tossed to and fro because if the
[2:27:16] weather's bad they're in a bad mood if
[2:27:18] if they're having a bad day everything's
[2:27:20] just terrible if if the Sun is out and
[2:27:23] everything's going good they're good
[2:27:24] they're tossed to and fro because of
[2:27:27] outward things is happening in their
[2:27:29] lives an incourt believer now he goes he
[2:27:33] he steps away from from the from the
[2:27:35] outward things that would bother us but
[2:27:38] now he steps into a place where it's an
[2:27:41] artificial light he steps into a place
[2:27:43] where the candlesticks are and where the
[2:27:46] the table of showbread is where the
[2:27:48] altar of incense is and and and it's
[2:27:52] it's a place that is a little more
[2:27:54] sincere than the outer Court people who
[2:27:57] brought their sacrifice to God they they
[2:28:00] couldn't enter into the to the holy
[2:28:03] place or to the inter uh into the in
[2:28:06] Veil The The Next Step because uh uh it
[2:28:10] wasn't their position to do so but in
[2:28:12] order for a priest to do that he had to
[2:28:15] be sincere in his walk with God but in
[2:28:19] order for us now to go from the from our
[2:28:22] first pull of Our Lives because as as we
[2:28:25] all have a Ministry in our life like
[2:28:27] brother James was saying we all have
[2:28:29] three pools in our lives we all have a a
[2:28:32] pull of the flesh man where we're caught
[2:28:34] up with the with the emotion and the
[2:28:36] flesh man we all have a a second pool
[2:28:39] where we're a little more spiritual and
[2:28:41] we notice a little more uh uh Revelation
[2:28:44] and things in our lives but it's it's
[2:28:46] not just good enough for us to go to the
[2:28:49] second we we must go past the veil and
[2:28:53] into that holy of
[2:28:55] holies but just the regular priests in
[2:28:59] the time of the temple were unable to go
[2:29:01] into the holiest of holies even the high
[2:29:04] priest himself he could just go in there
[2:29:07] once a year and when he went into the
[2:29:10] holiest of holies he had to be more
[2:29:12] sincere in his walk than he did
[2:29:16] previously because now he had to change
[2:29:19] his garment
[2:29:20] now he had to change how he walked now
[2:29:23] he had to change how he spoke and he
[2:29:25] would walk and he would say holy holy
[2:29:28] holy onto the Lord God Almighty his
[2:29:31] clothing was different his speech was
[2:29:34] different how he walked was different
[2:29:37] his sincerity coming before God was more
[2:29:41] sincere than it was in the in the inner
[2:29:44] Veil or in the Holy place now don't
[2:29:48] leave it just for the high priest or Old
[2:29:50] Testament this is a type for you and I
[2:29:53] and where we're living today in order
[2:29:56] for us to go to the next stage in our
[2:29:58] ministry in order for us to go from uh a
[2:30:03] a an outward believer a flesh believer
[2:30:06] to a spiritual believer to going into
[2:30:08] the very shakina Glory the very presence
[2:30:11] of God himself it's going to take a walk
[2:30:15] of
[2:30:18] sincerity as going to take Take a Walk
[2:30:21] of changing how we
[2:30:23] dress of changing how we talk of
[2:30:26] changing how we walk of changing the
[2:30:29] things that we listen to and we watch
[2:30:31] and how we live our daily lives in order
[2:30:34] to come into the very presence of God
[2:30:38] himself where the shakina glory is where
[2:30:41] there is no death and there's no more
[2:30:44] artificial light in that place but it's
[2:30:46] the very light of God himself the very
[2:30:50] life of God
[2:30:54] himself it is not
[2:30:57] about quality our quantity we say well
[2:31:01] how do we uh how do I be a little more
[2:31:04] sincere in reading my Bible and praying
[2:31:07] and we think well I'm going to make a
[2:31:09] New Year's resolution I'm going to pray
[2:31:11] for 10 minutes every day and I'm going
[2:31:13] to read for this amount every day and we
[2:31:15] try to set this big old goal but it's
[2:31:17] not about the quantity of how much we do
[2:31:22] but it's about the quality and sincerity
[2:31:25] of the heart of the believer that'll
[2:31:27] take us into the presence of God so
[2:31:31] brother Stephen what is your what is
[2:31:33] your vision for yourself and for us a
[2:31:35] little more sincerity a little more it
[2:31:38] doesn't matter about the quantity but

[2:52:14] Creature

[2:52:19] house of sister Josie and I saw on her
[2:52:23] backyard the the the the orange
[2:52:29] oranges and I I was thinking about the
[2:52:33] oranges about the
[2:52:36] fruit and I was thinking about the fruit
[2:52:39] don't eat
[2:52:41] fruits but the fruit is for somebody
[2:52:44] that needs to satisfy their needs to
[2:52:48] give healing to someone to give

[2:52:55] message to the
[2:52:59] people
[2:53:01] amen I
[2:53:04] believe the prophet said here in the
[2:53:06] godhead explained 1961 I believe that
[2:53:09] the blood cell was broke at Calvary for
[2:53:14] the remission of our sins and the spirit
[2:53:17] went out of him and came back upon the
[2:53:21] church because the church the Holy
[2:53:24] Spirit the Christ the
[2:53:28] logos was in us
[2:53:34] now the Holy Spirit by the
[2:53:37] baptism making us Christ separated
[2:53:41] himself giving his life to each one of
[2:53:45] us that we as a group of people people
[2:53:49] might be the Church of
[2:53:52] God Amen who is he talking he's talking
[2:53:56] to you and
[2:53:58] me in 2025 I want to see a Victorious
[2:54:03] church I want to
[2:54:05] see the Glorious
[2:54:08] church I want to see the
[2:54:12] army that don't even have a scratch in
[2:54:16] battle
[2:54:20] amen I was reading
[2:54:23] this church
[2:54:26] Universal I am a
[2:54:29] missionary I was thinking about the the
[2:54:32] the the the the baby that rose from the
[2:54:36] dead three weeks
[2:54:38] ago and I was thinking about these two
[2:54:43] words the the word has two meanings
[2:54:50] word means
[2:54:52] logos logos is the written
[2:54:56] word in the beginning was the word and
[2:54:59] the Word was with God and the Word was
[2:55:03] God but then on the other side it said
[2:55:07] it's a Rema
[2:55:09] word it's a Rema that will come to a
[2:55:14] person the litter can kill but the
[2:55:18] spirit will give
[2:55:21] life the word that I speak unto you has
[2:55:25] there are spirit and they are
[2:55:29] light
[2:55:31] now in Romans chapter 10:14 how then
[2:55:35] shall they they call on him in whom they
[2:55:39] have not
[2:55:41] believed and how shall they believe in
[2:55:44] him in whom they have not heard and how
[2:55:48] shall they he hear without a
[2:55:51] preacher and how shall they preach
[2:55:56] except they be sent and it is written
[2:55:59] how beautiful are the feet of them that
[2:56:02] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[2:56:05] Glad Tidings of good
[2:56:08] things but they that have not all obey
[2:56:12] the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who ha
[2:56:15] believed our report so so then Faith
[2:56:19] cometh by hearing and hearing the word
[2:56:24] Rema it takes
[2:56:26] somebody to carry this message and it
[2:56:30] will become a spoken
[2:56:34] word brothers and sisters God called us
[2:56:37] in a different kinds of ministry my
[2:56:40] Ministry is to preach the word of God
[2:56:42] maybe your ministry is to wash
[2:56:45] dishes or massage your husbands when he
[2:56:48] come
[2:56:51] home each of us has
[2:56:53] Ministry but remember you have the read
[2:56:56] my
[2:57:05] word the prophet
[2:57:07] said the
[2:57:09] voice he said what is the voice he said

[3:03:41] Darkness oh I thank God for his

[3:04:22] little bit of that for tomorrow as we go
[3:04:25] into the new
[3:04:27] year uh as our first day of
[3:04:33] service and uh I want to thank all of
[3:04:37] you for being a part of this
[3:04:41] church it
[3:04:42] is a microcosm of a very large body
[3:04:48] we are not Elite where we say we're it
[3:04:51] and we have it all no there's the bride
[3:04:53] of Christ is all over the world in fact
[3:04:56] he's been pulling a bride out in every
[3:04:58] age he's just finishing it
[3:05:01] up and he's saving the best Rel
[3:05:04] last praise the Lord amen we're going to
[3:05:07] be
[3:05:10] taking uh communion here in a in just a
[3:05:13] moment when takes about 15 20 minutes we
[3:05:16] want to you come through to not hesitate
[3:05:20] like perhaps we would on another
[3:05:28] evening it says during communion the
[3:05:31] deacons will not hand the wine or bread
[3:05:33] to you so when you come up you will grab
[3:05:36] your own Bread and Wine and if you need
[3:05:38] help grabbing them you get up to the
[3:05:42] front and let the deacons know and they
[3:05:44] will hand it to you
[3:05:51] and after we take communion what I'd
[3:05:53] like you to do is get with your
[3:05:56] families okay if you're scattered around
[3:05:58] I'd like you get in with your families
[3:06:02] and let's get on our
[3:06:03] knees let's go into the new year in
[3:06:06] prayer amen because if there's anything
[3:06:08] that's going to help us to get through
[3:06:12] 2025 is to start the year in prayer
[3:06:16] that's right and that's a good thing the
[3:06:17] Bible
[3:06:21] says for I have received of the Lord
[3:06:24] this is 1 Corinthians 11: 23 for I have
[3:06:28] received of the Lord that which also I
[3:06:31] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[3:06:34] the same night in which he was betrayed
[3:06:36] took
[3:06:37] bread and when he had given thanks he
[3:06:40] break it and said take eat this is my
[3:06:43] body which is broken for you this do in
[3:06:46] remembrance of me
[3:06:48] and after the same manner also he took
[3:06:51] the cup and when he had s saying this
[3:06:54] cup is the New
[3:06:56] Testament in the
[3:06:59] blood in my blood this do ye as often as
[3:07:03] you drink it in remembrance of me for as
[3:07:07] often as you eat this bread and drink
[3:07:09] this cup you do show the Lord's death
[3:07:11] till he
[3:07:13] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[3:07:16] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[3:07:18] unworthy shall be guilty of the body and
[3:07:21] blood of the Lord but let a man examine
[3:07:24] himself let him eat of the bread and
[3:07:26] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[3:07:28] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[3:07:31] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[3:07:35] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[3:07:38] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[3:07:42] if we would judge
[3:07:43] ourselves we should not be judged but
[3:07:47] when we we are judged we are chastened
[3:07:49] of the Lord that we should not be
[3:07:51] condemned with the world wherefore my
[3:07:54] brethren when you come to together to
[3:07:56] eat Terry one for another and if any man
[3:07:59] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[3:08:03] not together under condemnation and the
[3:08:05] rest will I set in order when I come
