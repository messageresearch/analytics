[46:22] amen and um I've been studying quite a a
[46:27] bit lately on the
[46:34] theophanies I wonder if we fully
[46:37] understand what this message is all
[46:38] about come on brother that's truth right
[46:43] amen do we really understand what God
[46:48] has done in this hour not only what he's
[46:51] done but what he's
[46:54] doing amen
[46:57] we dn't just make it a bunch of Creeds
[47:01] and dogmas and rules and
[47:05] regulations but may it be a
[47:07] life and that life should be the Life of
[47:11] Christ
[47:12] himself
[47:14] and I've done some study here
[47:18] on
[47:20] theophanies actually you type it in and
[47:23] you you'll type in theophany or
[47:25] theophanes
[47:27] you'll have 85 different
[47:30] quotes and it's just amazing to me to
[47:35] see what brother Brenham says about
[47:39] theophanies and remember that when you
[47:42] leave here and you go somewhere
[47:50] else than you when this Tabernacle be
[47:54] dissolved yes you have another
[47:57] one that's
[48:00] waiting amen it's waiting for
[48:03] you brother Bram says and down Through
[48:06] the Ages he said this
[48:09] theophany it will be speaking to you and
[48:12] he said sometimes Revelation it'll be
[48:14] things coming to you and he said you're
[48:17] actually hearing from your
[48:21] theophany hallelujah amen so I want to
[48:25] go in this direction I've got an awful
[48:27] lot this morning I don't know how far
[48:30] I'm going to go so I want to relax my
[48:33] spirit and say okay let's take it slowly
[48:36] let's look into this and let's just have
[48:38] a a jubilee time this morning and a
[48:41] Revival of seeing what God is doing in
[48:43] this hour amen Matthew 18: 10-14 and
[48:49] then we'll go to Hebrews 1 amen so good
[48:52] to have so many out to the house of the
[48:54] Lord many are gone this morning some are
[48:56] TR traveling uh my wife has left me she
[49:01] went up to
[49:02] presc her and my daughter Rebecca that's
[49:06] why it was a little bit late this
[49:08] morning uh I had to get out my own suit
[49:11] had to get out my own shirt and tie and
[49:14] and everything had to make my own coffee
[49:17] I called her up she says oh you poor
[49:24] thing yeah so
[49:27] anyway she told me what color suit and
[49:30] what color tie
[49:32] so she helped me out that way anyway
[49:35] praise the Lord Matthew chapter 18 may
[49:39] we ask God now to come and bless his
[49:43] word amen let it become an open book
[49:47] come on let it be a re revealed book
[49:50] that you might see yourself see a
[49:52] reflection Lord let me see something
[49:55] I've never seen before
[49:57] let me see the picture within the
[49:59] picture Matthew
[50:02] 18 verse 10 take
[50:05] heed that you despise not one of these
[50:08] little
[50:09] ones for I say unto you that in heaven
[50:13] their Angels do always behold the face
[50:17] of My Father which is in
[50:19] heaven notice their Angels these little
[50:24] ones do always yes now watch this that
[50:29] means
[50:31] continually behold the face of My Father
[50:34] which is in heaven for the son of man
[50:37] has come to save that which was
[50:40] lost how think ye if a man have a
[50:44] hundred sheep and one of them be gone
[50:47] astray do he not leave the 90 and n and
[50:51] goeth into the mountains and seeketh
[50:54] that which is gone astray
[50:57] and if so be that he find it verily I
[51:00] say unto you he rejoices more over over
[51:02] that
[51:03] sheep then of the 90 and N which went
[51:07] not
[51:09] astray even so it
[51:11] is not the will of your father it is not
[51:16] the will of your father which is in
[51:19] heaven that any of these little ones
[51:22] should perish that's
[51:25] right amen amen Hebrews 1 if you
[51:31] would Hebrews 1: 10 through
[51:36] 14 and thou Lord in the beginning H has
[51:40] laid the foundation of the
[51:43] earth and the heavens are the works of
[51:46] thy
[51:47] hands they Shall Perish but thou
[51:51] remainest and they all shall wax old as
[51:54] doth a
[51:55] garment and as a vesture Thou shalt fold
[51:58] them up and they shall be
[52:01] changed but Thou Art the same and thy
[52:05] years shall not
[52:07] fail but to which of the Angels said he
[52:10] at any
[52:12] time sit on my right hand until I make
[52:16] my thine enemies thy foot
[52:19] stol are not all these ministering
[52:24] Spirits sent forth to minister
[52:27] for them who shall be
[52:30] Heirs of
[52:32] Salvation may God add the blessing to
[52:34] the reading of his word you may be
[52:35] seated this morning I say
[52:38] amen and
[52:50] amen what a privileged people we are yes
[52:56] that God has seen fit to open our eyes
[53:00] of understanding of what he's done in
[53:02] this
[53:03] hour Amen to recognize your day in its
[53:07] message thank you Lord now it's far more
[53:10] than the way we
[53:12] dress it's far more than the way we go
[53:14] to
[53:16] church amen I would like to title my
[53:20] sermon this morning and I'm probably
[53:22] going to use this as a platform to
[53:24] launch out into
[53:27] um something perhaps in the next week or
[53:31] two so it's just been brewing on the
[53:35] back burner so to speak now for a few
[53:39] months and I've been praying about it
[53:42] seeking it and the Lord the other day
[53:46] just spoke to my heart in fact quickened
[53:49] it to me so quickly he said go into your
[53:52] room and write this down
[53:55] amen and I was really quickened
[53:58] immediately to go in because I don't
[54:00] want to forget that
[54:02] thought and we as human beings can tend
[54:06] to forget and if we don't write it down
[54:08] you may forget that and I've had that
[54:12] before and it's very very frustrating
[54:15] and so I learn I'm learning I'm learning
[54:19] that when you are given a thought go go
[54:21] write it down and then the holy spirit
[54:23] will bring it to your remembrance amen
[54:26] I'd like to title my sermon this morning
[54:29] being united with your
[54:32] theophany
[54:36] through the revealing of the son of
[54:42] man and I want to take a subject this
[54:44] morning the loud and bride is United to
[54:46] the word under the seventh
[54:50] seal so this message is
[54:53] so greater than we could ever
[54:58] imagin and
[55:02] uh like I said I've been studying and
[55:07] praying about this for a couple months
[55:10] now and I looked up you know brother
[55:13] Brenham said I went and looked up Oxford
[55:15] or Webster dictionary and I happened
[55:18] this morning to look up in the Oxford
[55:20] dictionary um of what a theophany is and
[55:26] Oxford says that it is a visible
[55:31] manifestation to humankind of a God or a
[55:37] god of God or a God so we know that it's
[55:41] a visible manifestation in fact as I
[55:45] begin to study this that through the
[55:47] scripture there are over 50 visible
[55:52] manifestations of God which could be
[55:55] termed a theophany of God it is a
[55:58] visible manifestation of an invisible
[56:03] God he can show himself in many
[56:05] different ways the word theophany is
[56:08] actually made up of two words Theos
[56:11] which means god an epiphany a Theos
[56:16] Epiphany an appearing so God doing an
[56:21] appearing and we know that God when he
[56:24] shows himself
[56:27] in many different visible forms whatever
[56:29] way God comes whatever way God chooses
[56:33] at that
[56:34] time that he is doing it for a purpose
[56:37] God doesn't do anything haphazardly he
[56:40] always does something for a
[56:43] purpose he came as a pillar of fire as a
[56:46] cloud by day as a burning bush as a
[56:50] rushing Mighty Wind as a whirlwind in
[56:53] the top of a tree or in the malberry
[56:56] tree God has shown himself down Through
[56:59] the Ages and the Bible is filled with
[57:03] Angel
[57:05] visitations amen so it behooves all of
[57:09] us to use our
[57:11] discernment and spiritual understanding
[57:15] and we are commanded of God to try the
[57:17] spirits and see if they be of God
[57:21] brother Brenham said why that one angel
[57:24] or an appearance of what appeared to be
[57:26] the angel or or the Lord himself before
[57:30] St Martin and he had a crown remember
[57:32] and he said I am your lord Bow Down and
[57:35] Worship me and he was already crowned
[57:36] and Martin Knew by the word of God that
[57:39] he will be crowned later by the Saints
[57:42] and he knew that this Apparition this
[57:44] visible thing that was before him was
[57:46] not him so he was trying the
[57:51] spirits and
[57:54] so um
[57:57] I looked up in what brother Brenham says
[57:59] in the balm of Gilead what is an
[58:04] angel It's a
[58:07] messenger get the dictionary and find
[58:09] out what does an angel
[58:11] mean some of them's Heavenly Messengers
[58:14] some of them's Earthly Messengers that
[58:17] God dwells in to bring his Earthly
[58:20] message now whenever you understand
[58:23] whenever Angels come and there is a
[58:27] visitation to mankind it's for a
[58:31] purpose because God will never bring
[58:34] judgment without first
[58:38] warning these are messengers angels of
[58:41] the Lord Messengers to you they're
[58:45] standing back there with their hands out
[58:47] to obey What God Says lay hands on the
[58:49] sick they shall recover it has to happen
[58:51] doesn't it now most all of you have been
[58:54] affected by
[58:57] Angels sometime in your life
[59:01] yes you have witnessed with your
[59:04] eyes the angel or the pillar of fire
[59:08] that has come in this age brother
[59:09] Brenham said just seeing the picture of
[59:12] the pillar of fire above the prophet's
[59:14] head he says can bring judgment to the
[59:18] world he says actually those that see
[59:21] the picture he says is a greater
[59:24] manifestation than those who saw it
[59:29] physically and remember one time there
[59:31] was a woman who saw that and she looked
[59:34] at it and she
[59:35] snickered in making fun of it and it
[59:38] said she blasphemed God yes sir so there
[59:42] are angels and ministering spirits that
[59:45] are all around us and we have the Angels
[59:48] so we've seen that the pillar of fire
[59:50] has come in this hour and it's done for
[59:54] a purpose amen and you have been witness
[59:58] of an Earthly Angel which we all can
[1:00:02] recognize or should recognize is the
[1:00:06] angel of Revelations
[1:00:09] 10:7 but then you also have other
[1:00:12] Messengers under that messenger or that
[1:00:16] prophetic Ministry of the Angel
[1:00:20] Messengers brother Brenham said that are
[1:00:22] in the
[1:00:24] Pulpit that's true
[1:00:26] so the Bible is filled with all kinds of
[1:00:28] Angel
[1:00:29] visitations and when he comes down makes
[1:00:32] himself known but did many times when
[1:00:35] that happens the people do not
[1:00:38] recognize that it was an angel we see it
[1:00:41] in the scriptures that after the angel
[1:00:44] disappears or whatever then they
[1:00:46] recognize it was an angel even brother
[1:00:49] Billy Paul to me said brother Ron I did
[1:00:52] not know who my daddy was until after he
[1:00:56] passed away and then I realized to him
[1:00:59] it was just daddy with a
[1:01:01] gift but he says after he went away then
[1:01:04] he understood oh
[1:01:07] my that was the angel to the Church of
[1:01:11] laiaa now we're talking the Earthly
[1:01:13] Angel because we know there was a
[1:01:15] Heavenly angel that came down and met
[1:01:17] with him
[1:01:20] now um we know of different Angel
[1:01:24] visitations Gabriel was sent to
[1:01:28] Mary to let her know that she was a
[1:01:31] chosen vessel of God and brother Brenham
[1:01:33] uses that so much of the time and he
[1:01:35] said as it was with Mary so shall it be
[1:01:38] with the bride yes that there'll be
[1:01:41] someone come there'll be an angel
[1:01:43] messenger let you know that you are a
[1:01:45] chosen vessel of
[1:01:47] God because we had a messenger tell us
[1:01:50] how that God chooses a bride yes he
[1:01:53] looks for character not Beauty
[1:01:56] he looks for attributes that are his
[1:01:59] attributes
[1:02:03] amen Angel spoke to Saul on the road to
[1:02:08] Damascus there he was knocked off his
[1:02:11] high horse and to the ground and he says
[1:02:14] Lord who art thou he said I'm Jesus whom
[1:02:17] thou
[1:02:19] persecutest then we see ananas was
[1:02:22] visited by an Angel to go and pray for
[1:02:24] Saul can you imagine this man who's been
[1:02:27] persecuting the church I think this is
[1:02:30] one of the most outstanding scriptures
[1:02:33] of a man who has a visitation and God
[1:02:36] tells him to go and do something and he
[1:02:38] thinks you mean
[1:02:42] Saul amen really that Saul the one who's
[1:02:46] been persecuting and killing the
[1:02:48] Christians and putting them in jail I
[1:02:51] mean this may mean my
[1:02:54] death he said I've chosen him for is he
[1:02:57] he is a vessel and
[1:02:59] imagine that
[1:03:01] everywhere that Paul would go later Saul
[1:03:05] to
[1:03:05] Paul everywhere he would go he would
[1:03:09] identify there was a
[1:03:11] man who came to pray for me and lay
[1:03:15] hands on me that the scales of my eyes
[1:03:18] would fall off and he said that man was
[1:03:21] ananas imagine everywhere that he went
[1:03:23] and how that um
[1:03:26] so many people did not know of ananas
[1:03:29] but they had heard of Saul or the
[1:03:32] Apostle
[1:03:33] Paul oh my one day we'll get up there
[1:03:36] and we will he's not ananas and saf he
[1:03:39] is ananas just another CU many have the
[1:03:42] same name you all know
[1:03:45] that
[1:03:47] Jacob wrestled yeah with an
[1:03:52] angel Gideon met an angel
[1:03:56] what's amazing is they make a
[1:03:59] proclamation to whoever they are coming
[1:04:03] to and he says uh hey Gideon thou art a
[1:04:06] mighty man of Valor who me yeah yeah you
[1:04:11] he didn't know it and I want you to
[1:04:14] understand that this messenger has come
[1:04:16] to show you you are predestinated
[1:04:19] ordained of God you are chosen of God to
[1:04:22] hear God's voice in this hour and to
[1:04:25] manifest yes that which is God is doing
[1:04:27] in this hour you're a chosen vessel of
[1:04:33] God God sends angels to bring about a
[1:04:38] change we have been
[1:04:41] influenced by an angel in this
[1:04:44] hour can you say Amen to that that's why
[1:04:48] all of you are here y yes because there
[1:04:51] was something Supernatural that came
[1:04:54] across your path
[1:04:57] and when that Prophet began to
[1:05:00] speak even at the as the woman said it
[1:05:04] was more than a
[1:05:09] man all of you can bear
[1:05:12] witness that when you heard the voice of
[1:05:14] the seventh
[1:05:16] angel when he began to sound what
[1:05:20] happened there was something inside of
[1:05:21] you there was a deep calling to the Deep
[1:05:25] there for this deep inside of you you
[1:05:27] didn't understand it let me tell you God
[1:05:29] never did ask you to understand it he
[1:05:32] just said Do you believe it and there's
[1:05:34] something inside of you that if you
[1:05:36] heard that voice you said beyond your
[1:05:39] caral knowledge beyond your
[1:05:41] understanding something inside of you
[1:05:43] said I believe
[1:05:45] that yes sir it's nothing but the
[1:05:53] truth that inspiration would come upon
[1:05:55] had he
[1:05:56] right and all she said was that's
[1:05:59] nothing but the
[1:06:02] truth once you
[1:06:07] identify that who is
[1:06:10] speaking you're
[1:06:13] uniting with the very merging of Heaven
[1:06:16] coming down I want you to understand
[1:06:20] that as the Lord
[1:06:21] descends with a shout with a voice with
[1:06:24] a trumpet he does all three as he's
[1:06:27] descending yes sir I want you to
[1:06:30] understand this message is bringing to
[1:06:32] you such a
[1:06:34] supernatural understanding of what's
[1:06:36] happening in this hour I don't think we
[1:06:39] have much time left I believe that the
[1:06:42] the sands of time are just about
[1:06:50] over all of you have been
[1:06:53] witness of what God has done in this
[1:06:56] hour it's a
[1:06:58] voice that he sent and that voice began
[1:07:02] to ring something inside of you your
[1:07:07] receiver if you please this receiver
[1:07:11] this seed that was in you began to
[1:07:15] resonate it was being quickened because
[1:07:18] everything that God did in the beginning
[1:07:21] God said and God said and God said what
[1:07:24] was he doing speaking his word and his
[1:07:27] word spoken amen must become a
[1:07:31] manifestation because of it remains just
[1:07:34] a thought it's only a thought but when
[1:07:37] it is spoken it becomes a manifestation
[1:07:41] he can think about light but it wasn't
[1:07:43] light until he said let there be
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:46] [Applause]
[1:07:49] light many of you I could have you bear
[1:07:54] witness that if you through throughout
[1:07:55] your life have unexplainable things that
[1:07:59] have happened to you that you
[1:08:02] said it must have been an
[1:08:05] angel it must because it was
[1:08:09] Supernatural someone came someone did
[1:08:13] someone said or whatever and the next
[1:08:16] thing you turn around look they're
[1:08:20] gone I'll tell you I remember a
[1:08:24] supernatural element I was probably
[1:08:26] about
[1:08:27] 16 we were coming from a Bible study a
[1:08:32] youth
[1:08:33] Fellowship we were in a car a Volkswagen
[1:08:36] and a girl by the name of Irene Coughlin
[1:08:38] was driving little Volkswagen Bug we
[1:08:43] were in this car and it was here we are
[1:08:45] in San Diego and we're we're on the
[1:08:48] freeway and you know it's one of them
[1:08:50] storms or your windshield wipers are
[1:08:52] just going as fast as they can and it's
[1:08:55] not fast
[1:08:56] enough and and we were just going we
[1:08:59] were singing and we were rejoicing and
[1:09:01] you know how the little Volkswagen Bug
[1:09:04] it doesn't have a very good uh system to
[1:09:07] keep the the windshield from being
[1:09:10] fogged up and everything and we're just
[1:09:12] singing and Irene is is wiping the fog
[1:09:15] on the inside and we're excuse me and
[1:09:18] we're just going
[1:09:20] along probably doing 65 70 M an hour
[1:09:24] much faster than should have but we're
[1:09:27] going along and all of a sudden there
[1:09:29] was an 18-wheeler right in front of us
[1:09:31] I'm sitting on the passenger side in the
[1:09:34] front
[1:09:35] seat and Irene doesn't know what to do
[1:09:38] all of a sudden the it's there it's it's
[1:09:41] either slowed down almost to a
[1:09:43] standstill or it was at a stop and all
[1:09:46] of a sudden a it's there and Irene threw
[1:09:49] up her her arms and she screamed a like
[1:09:53] this and as she did and we're I mean
[1:09:56] we're headed straight for
[1:09:59] it she threw her hands up and the wheel
[1:10:04] turned I saw it thank you Lord I Saw the
[1:10:09] Wheel
[1:10:11] turn and it turned to the left and we
[1:10:14] missed the
[1:10:18] trailer and all of
[1:10:20] us even Irene said what just happened
[1:10:26] I let go we were all
[1:10:28] stunned and I realized right then it was
[1:10:32] not our time how many of you have had
[1:10:35] unexplainable things it wasn't your
[1:10:38] time why God watching over you something
[1:10:41] in the invisible realm came down grabbed
[1:10:44] a hold of a wheel it did
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:52] something so for a few moments this
[1:10:55] morning I would like to look closely at
[1:10:57] what the prophet said about angels
[1:11:01] ministering spirits and guardian angels
[1:11:07] am resurrection of Lazarus
[1:11:10] 1953 God always sends his
[1:11:14] warnings just before the coming of Jesus
[1:11:18] he sent an angel down Out Of Heaven by
[1:11:20] the name of Gabriel now minor Angels
[1:11:23] come yes
[1:11:26] my yes you see Angels everyone has a
[1:11:30] guardian angel according to the
[1:11:34] scripture Jesus said there Angels always
[1:11:38] beholding my father's face which is in
[1:11:41] heaven now he's taking the
[1:11:44] scripture that we started
[1:11:47] with in Matthew 18 and these little ones
[1:11:51] despise not these little ones and it is
[1:11:54] your father father's will that none of
[1:11:56] them
[1:12:01] perish so now brother Brenham is
[1:12:05] making a suggestion to us that these
[1:12:08] angels now I'm going to I'm going to um
[1:12:12] approach this in a very careful manner
[1:12:16] this morning because I don't want you to
[1:12:20] misunderstand but you will find out that
[1:12:23] these angels which did not
[1:12:26] fall are a
[1:12:29] representation of the elect that told
[1:12:34] Satan know in the
[1:12:43] beginning it says that these little ones
[1:12:46] always behold the father's face in
[1:12:52] heaven now let's see
[1:12:55] take this slowly and I have a hard time
[1:12:59] not wanting to run faster than what I
[1:13:02] should this morning in questions and
[1:13:06] answers on
[1:13:07] Genesis now the first man now he made
[1:13:11] the first man in His
[1:13:14] image and we're returning back to that
[1:13:18] image that's right to our first
[1:13:24] created
[1:13:26] image when God created me William
[1:13:29] Brandon I was before the foundation of
[1:13:31] the world he made me made my being my
[1:13:34] spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as
[1:13:37] far as I know of I was
[1:13:40] there I don't believe you're getting
[1:13:45] it I love this probably because they're
[1:13:50] going like students when the teacher
[1:13:52] trying and they I'm not getting it so
[1:13:55] now watch this he says but now just a
[1:13:58] minute Jesus told the disciples that he
[1:14:01] knew them before the foundation of the
[1:14:04] world and Paul said here that he chose
[1:14:07] us in him before the world
[1:14:10] began now there was some part of
[1:14:13] me Morman Neville and the rest of all
[1:14:17] you
[1:14:18] here that's in Christ Jesus before the
[1:14:22] world ever began and here's to my
[1:14:25] analysis of that you want to hear his
[1:14:28] analysis I think that the people today
[1:14:32] that are possessed with this
[1:14:34] Spirit or the spirit AP part of these
[1:14:37] Angelic
[1:14:39] beings Spirits which rotated off of
[1:14:43] God that never
[1:14:46] fell my
[1:14:51] God that never fell in the beginning
[1:14:56] and resist the de the devil's lie in
[1:14:59] heaven brother Brenham said the original
[1:15:03] you God took a picture of you before the
[1:15:06] foundation of the world and put it in
[1:15:08] his family
[1:15:13] album but this you is after the
[1:15:18] fall and it's made an image of
[1:15:23] that but you are not complete without
[1:15:26] that which never
[1:15:28] fell I'll substantiate that in just a
[1:15:34] moment but he said these Angelic
[1:15:38] beings Spirits which rotated off of
[1:15:43] God that never fell in the
[1:15:46] beginning and resisted the devil's lie
[1:15:51] in heaven now remember that on our last
[1:15:54] tape service Sunday
[1:15:56] evening we listen to the sermon
[1:15:59] Discerning of spirit wow and those of
[1:16:02] you that missed it we were having a
[1:16:04] wonderful time and oh it was just
[1:16:07] lovely and also my giving you quotes
[1:16:10] concerning spiritual Amnesia now brother
[1:16:12] Brenham only preaches the sermon
[1:16:14] spiritual Amnesia once right but in that
[1:16:17] sermon he uses the word Amnesia 28
[1:16:23] times he says Amnesia is a disease that
[1:16:27] is caused by three
[1:16:29] things a shock of some
[1:16:33] kind either the effects of war that can
[1:16:36] cause a shock or Amnesia many men who go
[1:16:39] to war have that and brother Brenham
[1:16:41] talks about that soldier boy that
[1:16:44] through the shock of War he had forgot
[1:16:47] who he was and he had Shell Shock It
[1:16:50] wasn't until he was on a train I believe
[1:16:54] going through a part of where he was
[1:16:55] raised up and all of a sudden he looked
[1:16:57] out the window and he saw a water
[1:17:00] tower he said I got off the train as it
[1:17:03] had made it stop I got off and he said
[1:17:06] this Soldier Boy doesn't know why he's
[1:17:09] walking this direction but it seems
[1:17:11] familiar and he keeps
[1:17:16] going this message keep going this
[1:17:20] message my brother my sister is familiar
[1:17:25] yes
[1:17:25] sir it is taking you places where you
[1:17:28] were
[1:17:30] before you just keep walking hey Wow Wow
[1:17:35] when he said that when he preached that
[1:17:38] all of a sudden I was jettisoned I was I
[1:17:40] was back there it gave me just a brief
[1:17:43] all of a sudden a little millisecond wow
[1:17:46] how wonderful how blessed that is my
[1:17:50] brother my sister one of these days it
[1:17:52] won't just be a little flash of a midle
[1:17:54] a second it'll be flash after flash
[1:17:58] until all of a sudden it will be a
[1:18:01] reality Hallelujah and
[1:18:05] Enoch stepped into his
[1:18:08] vision and he was
[1:18:11] not that's how real this is
[1:18:16] becoming this
[1:18:19] message right now universally around the
[1:18:23] world is being moved
[1:18:26] upon into the minds of an elect lady and
[1:18:31] she is no longer an immature woman to
[1:18:33] pass off uh this promise to someone else
[1:18:37] but she's embracing it to her own bosom
[1:18:40] and she's saying be it unto me according
[1:18:43] to Thy word cuz she believed the
[1:18:46] angel do you believe the
[1:18:53] angel it said sh can cause Amnesia and
[1:18:56] that's the you not knowing who you are
[1:18:59] and I tell you there is a real identity
[1:19:01] crisis in the world today but I say even
[1:19:05] among message
[1:19:07] Believers you can be raised up in this
[1:19:10] message you can be around it you can see
[1:19:13] the
[1:19:14] effects but until you have wrestled with
[1:19:18] the angel yourself amen amen all it is
[1:19:22] is just well that's what Mom and Dad
[1:19:24] yeah that's their
[1:19:28] religion that's the way it was with
[1:19:30] Jacob God was not real to Jacob he
[1:19:35] talked about the God of Abraham and the
[1:19:37] god of Isaac but it wasn't his God and
[1:19:41] so therefore
[1:19:43] God
[1:19:45] hallelujah
[1:19:48] God has an
[1:19:50] appointment with every elect seed
[1:19:54] there'll be a time where he will come
[1:19:56] down and he will
[1:19:58] meet and he will speak to the seed my
[1:20:02] sheep hear my voice and a stranger they
[1:20:05] will not
[1:20:08] follow you'll begin to hear something
[1:20:10] something inside of you resonates
[1:20:13] something inside of you beyond this
[1:20:15] carnal knowledge Beyond you trying to
[1:20:18] understand it it's Revelation striking
[1:20:21] you what is it your deepest responding
[1:20:23] to the Deep
[1:20:29] shock will do it
[1:20:31] worry will cause doubt and unbelief oh I
[1:20:35] just wonder oh worry
[1:20:40] worry when we worry we do not doubt
[1:20:44] and and when we have faith there is no
[1:20:48] doubt
[1:20:55] or you can get amnesia when you're
[1:20:58] halted between two opinions yeah if
[1:21:02] there's ever a time when people within
[1:21:04] this message listen to me closely now
[1:21:08] are halted between multiple opinions
[1:21:12] this one on the internet here and this
[1:21:14] one over here and this one over here
[1:21:17] until finally people get confused and if
[1:21:20] the parents are confused let me tell you
[1:21:22] the children will become confused
[1:21:25] amen God help us have clear
[1:21:27] understanding God help us to understand
[1:21:30] who we are and where we come
[1:21:33] from just as you were in the lines of
[1:21:36] your father but you don't remember it so
[1:21:39] were you in the mind of God in the
[1:21:40] beginning but you don't remember it but
[1:21:43] you are the very offspring of God now
[1:21:47] I'm going to S I'm going to say
[1:21:48] something here and I want you to listen
[1:21:51] carefully
[1:21:57] you are not created
[1:22:00] theophanies you are
[1:22:02] begotten
[1:22:08] theophanies because even Satan and his
[1:22:11] angels were
[1:22:14] created but we're not
[1:22:17] begotten but you who are of
[1:22:21] God he didn't create you
[1:22:25] he begat you
[1:22:27] amen you're his you're his
[1:22:30] offspring let me show you in scripture
[1:22:32] acts 17:
[1:22:35] 27 that they should seek the Lord if
[1:22:37] happily they might feel after him and
[1:22:40] find him though he may not far from
[1:22:42] every one of us for in him we
[1:22:45] live and move and have our being as
[1:22:49] certain also as your own poets have said
[1:22:52] for we all are also his
[1:22:57] offspring prise the
[1:23:08] Lord Adam the first
[1:23:11] man was begotten of
[1:23:16] God you understand that the second
[1:23:20] Adam begotten of God
[1:23:26] do you know the first man born of a
[1:23:29] woman a deceived
[1:23:35] Church by a union with Lucifer Satan
[1:23:41] himself the
[1:23:42] serpent he beguiled Eve a deceived
[1:23:46] Church by the
[1:23:49] world and she took his
[1:23:53] thoughts and received it into her mind
[1:23:56] and later he seduced her
[1:23:59] physically do you understand that and
[1:24:02] the first seed that came forth of a
[1:24:08] woman was Cain and Cain the Bible says
[1:24:13] was of the wicked one and you want to
[1:24:15] see how Wicked he is he had the ways of
[1:24:18] his father in
[1:24:20] him that even when Abel Abel by fa
[1:24:27] Faith he gave a sacrifice better than
[1:24:30] that of Cain why because faith is a
[1:24:33] revelation it was revealed to him God
[1:24:36] cannot reject his own revelation God
[1:24:40] cannot reject his own
[1:24:45] word that's why you were begotten in the
[1:24:49] mind of
[1:24:50] God do you understand it in the mind he
[1:24:53] had attributes
[1:24:54] those were thoughts they were Eternal in
[1:24:58] him Hallelujah you had fellowship with
[1:25:01] him let me tell you there was a shock a
[1:25:05] fall a war that started in heaven and
[1:25:09] you were separated from that Angelic
[1:25:11] part of you that never
[1:25:14] fell and God
[1:25:17] allowed allowed because of sex birth to
[1:25:21] come down here to be be brought into
[1:25:25] this Earth by a uh sex birth Y and he
[1:25:30] said therefore he said the first one who
[1:25:33] had rule over you was your first
[1:25:37] husband how many of you know that and he
[1:25:40] said there's only one way to break that
[1:25:43] he said it's got to be a death amen and
[1:25:47] so he's not going to die till he's
[1:25:49] thrown in the Lake of Fire so how do you
[1:25:52] break the union spiritual death and he
[1:25:55] that comes to Christ must die and
[1:26:01] give know you not that you must be born
[1:26:04] again because that which born of the
[1:26:06] flesh is flesh do you know the Bible
[1:26:08] says that Flesh and Blood shall not
[1:26:11] inherit the kingdom of God that's why
[1:26:13] this body has got to be changed in a
[1:26:15] moment in a twinkling of an eye and
[1:26:18] you'll all be changed but guess what
[1:26:20] God's doing it right now he's
[1:26:23] transforming
[1:26:24] [Applause]
[1:26:27] from this terrestrial to a Celestial
[1:26:31] you're hearing something
[1:26:35] beyond beyond that curtain of time
[1:26:37] there's something there is a part of you
[1:26:40] that is encouraging yourself come on boy
[1:26:43] you can do it come on buddy there are
[1:26:46] times you reading your Bible at home
[1:26:51] doing something and all of a sudden a
[1:26:53] thought comes to you you're better than
[1:26:58] that what is it your theophany that
[1:27:00] angel being part of you that never fell
[1:27:04] in the beginning it's
[1:27:12] there the Bible says acts 17:28 for in
[1:27:16] him we live and move have our being and
[1:27:19] certain also your own poets have said
[1:27:22] for you are also his offspring for as
[1:27:25] much then as we are The Offspring of God
[1:27:30] we ought not to think that the God has
[1:27:32] like un gold or silver or stone or
[1:27:34] Graven by Art and man's
[1:27:37] devices and that the times of this
[1:27:39] ignorance God winked at it but now
[1:27:43] commandeth all men everywhere to
[1:27:47] repent because he hath appointed a day
[1:27:50] amen amen that's why the prophet of God
[1:27:54] was so um accustomed to looking at times
[1:27:58] and
[1:27:59] Seasons
[1:28:01] s is this the sign s what time is
[1:28:08] it do you see he's making you acutely
[1:28:12] aware there's an appointed time s is
[1:28:16] this the sign of the end is this the
[1:28:19] appointed time is this when Revelations
[1:28:21] 10:7 will begin to sound not when he
[1:28:25] begins his ministry not the first and
[1:28:28] second pull those were gathering but the
[1:28:31] third pole is a separating pull it is
[1:28:35] one that is an offensive pull to those
[1:28:38] without Revelation but to those who have
[1:28:41] Revelation it's
[1:28:43] life
[1:28:45] Hall does this offend you no
[1:28:55] be because he hath appointed a day in
[1:28:58] the which he will judge the world in
[1:29:01] righteousness that by that man whom he
[1:29:06] hath
[1:29:07] ordained whereof he hath given Assurance
[1:29:09] un all men that he hath raised him from
[1:29:12] the dead we have entered into a
[1:29:15] Time listen closely now this message has
[1:29:19] come to adoption
[1:29:26] the message is becoming
[1:29:29] clearer am I the only one who seems to
[1:29:33] find out that as I listen to a tape it
[1:29:36] becomes a new
[1:29:38] tape I read my bibl a new Bible why did
[1:29:41] I never see that
[1:29:43] before why because now is the
[1:29:48] season Jesus said he said behold I'd
[1:29:53] like to tell you many things but seeing
[1:29:55] that you cannot bear them now how be it
[1:29:57] after I'm
[1:29:58] Gone the holy spirit will come and bring
[1:30:01] to your remembrance everything that I
[1:30:03] said to you Hallelujah so there's a
[1:30:06] quickening power you may come to church
[1:30:09] you may have something laid on your
[1:30:11] heart there may be the Word of Promise
[1:30:13] placed inside of you but there'll come a
[1:30:15] time when that is quickened by the Holy
[1:30:18] Spirit and you'll recognize it and
[1:30:20] you'll grab the promise and you will
[1:30:22] seize it and say that's
[1:30:24] that's my
[1:30:26] inheritance amen sir somebody say Amen
[1:30:29] to
[1:30:30] [Applause]
[1:30:32] them

[1:30:38] 23 for as many as are led by the spirit
[1:30:42] of
[1:30:43] God they are the sons of
[1:30:47] God you have not received the spirit of
[1:30:50] bondage again to fear but have received
[1:30:53] the
[1:30:54] Spirit of
[1:30:56] adoption whereby you cry Abba Father I
[1:31:00] looked up the word ABA father one time
[1:31:02] and you know what it means Because Why
[1:31:04] didn't it just say my father my father
[1:31:07] Abba Father Is by Revelation calling
[1:31:13] him in a relationship he is Abba
[1:31:21] Father understand something far greater
[1:31:23] G than than just calling our heavenly
[1:31:28] father I call him Abba Father with a
[1:31:31] quickening power placing him as
[1:31:35] omnipotent as being the head as being
[1:31:39] the
[1:31:39] rule as being King
[1:31:48] theophany Spirit itself Beth witness
[1:31:52] with our spirit that we are the children

[1:34:45] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:34:50] ourselves waiting for the adoption to it
[1:34:55] the Redemption of our
[1:34:58] body brother renam says you have the
[1:35:00] earnest of your inheritance he says you
[1:35:03] are redeemed that inner man inside of
[1:35:06] you is redeemed but this flesh body
[1:35:09] listen because it is a byproduct of sin
[1:35:11] none of you shall see God in this flesh
[1:35:15] body it's got to be
[1:35:17] changed but God is doing it right now
[1:35:20] he's changing you from Glory unto Glory
[1:35:25] he's changing you from terrestrial to
[1:35:28] Celestial he's sending you Angels he's
[1:35:31] sending you Witnesses he's sending you
[1:35:34] voices from the edge of Eternity letting
[1:35:37] you know who you
[1:35:40] are yes sir not how to dress that's a
[1:35:44] part of it not how to go to church
[1:35:46] that's a part of it but I'll tell you
[1:35:49] what on it's not how good you you
[1:35:54] are it's how good he
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:35:59] is in the Old Testament when they
[1:36:01] brought a lamb to be offered for the
[1:36:04] sacrifice of sin let me tell you the
[1:36:06] levitical priest never looked at the man
[1:36:09] bringing the
[1:36:12] lamb God is not looking at you he's
[1:36:15] looking at your lamb how many you say
[1:36:18] Jesus is my lamb he is without spot or
[1:36:23] wrinkle amen yes sir never looked at the
[1:36:27] man he looked at the
[1:36:32] lamb thank thank you
[1:36:35] Jesus let me say this
[1:36:39] also none of you in this flesh will ever
[1:36:44] be good
[1:36:52] enough it's not not by works of
[1:36:55] righteousness but by his grace I'm saved
[1:36:59] it's not by works of
[1:37:01] righteousness but by his grace I'm saved
[1:37:05] you
[1:37:08] understand it ain't how long your dress
[1:37:11] is although when God gives you
[1:37:14] revelation of modest apparel you put it
[1:37:17] on and God says that's righteous because
[1:37:21] it's not the long dress it's itself it
[1:37:25] is the modesty given from the very Mind
[1:37:27] Of God because without
[1:37:30] Holiness the Bible says no man shall see
[1:37:32] God if we are not different than modern
[1:37:37] Christianity if we don't look different
[1:37:39] dress different talk different act
[1:37:41] different then we are not different but
[1:37:45] you God has chosen he's chosen you
[1:37:51] he's yes
[1:37:53] he made you
[1:37:58] different he said you men will dress
[1:38:00] like men you women will dress like
[1:38:07] women Galatians 4 verses 1-7 now I say
[1:38:11] that the heir as long as he is a
[1:38:15] child differeth nothing from a
[1:38:19] servant though he be the Lord of all
[1:38:22] yeah
[1:38:24] he's
[1:38:26] air as long as he is a little
[1:38:29] child immature thinks as a child acts
[1:38:33] like a
[1:38:34] child and Paul said when I put away
[1:38:36] childish
[1:38:38] things I became a
[1:38:42] man that's what God told job job I want
[1:38:45] to talk to you like a man
[1:38:49] right G up your lines joob I want to
[1:38:53] talk talk to you I demand of you an
[1:38:55] answer where were you when the sons of

[1:39:16] time appointed of the father an
[1:39:19] appointed
[1:39:20] time even so we

[1:39:26] under the elements of the
[1:39:28] world when the fullness of time was come
[1:39:31] notice always about time when the
[1:39:33] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[1:39:36] his son made of a woman made under the
[1:39:39] law to redeem
[1:39:41] them that were under the law that he
[1:39:44] might receive the adoption of sons and
[1:39:48] because you are Sons yes and because you
[1:39:52] are Sons
[1:39:54] the prophet of God made an astounding
[1:39:57] statement he said because you are Sons
[1:40:02] you have the right to the New
[1:40:04] Birth he said in
[1:40:07] nonseed there's nothing to
[1:40:10] Quicken he said the new birth did not
[1:40:13] change the
[1:40:14] seed because you are seed because you
[1:40:18] are
[1:40:20] Sons amen hallah because you are
[1:40:26] [Applause]
[1:40:31] sons help me
[1:40:34] Lord whereby because you are Sons God
[1:40:37] has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:40:40] into your hearts again crying Abba
[1:40:44] Father wherefore Thou Art no more a
[1:40:47] servant but a son and if a son then an

[1:42:01] himself that's why a word birth causes

[1:55:37] quote 1957 questions and
[1:55:41] answers I'm not going to read the whole
[1:55:43] quote but italicize so the Catholics
[1:55:46] call it the Eternal sunship of
[1:55:50] God which I have said before the word
[1:55:52] doesn't even make sense see there cannot
[1:55:55] be an eternal son because a son had to
[1:55:58] have a
[1:56:02] beginning a son had to have a beginning
[1:56:06] and so
[1:56:08] Jesus this a now take this chew on this
[1:56:12] for a minute Jesus had a
[1:56:16] beginning because he was the beginning
[1:56:19] of the
[1:56:20] creation of God
[1:56:22] God but the Bible says he is also the
[1:56:26] only begotten Son of God now watch
[1:56:31] this he says see there cannot be an
[1:56:35] eternal son because a son had to have a
[1:56:37] beginning and so Jesus had a beginning
[1:56:40] God had no
[1:56:44] beginning no beginning of
[1:56:48] days nor ending of life he had no father
[1:56:51] or mother
[1:56:53] who
[1:56:55] is this
[1:57:00] miles he says not Eternal sunship but
[1:57:05] the son that was with the father in the
[1:57:07] beginning was the logos that went out of
[1:57:10] out of God it was the
[1:57:14] theophany of God that went out it was
[1:57:18] God himself God's theophany in another
[1:57:21] form because God is a spirit and you do
[1:57:24] not know how to worship God who is a
[1:57:28] spirit that you cannot understand so God
[1:57:32] condescended down and he brought to us a
[1:57:35] thought and he put that logos thought
[1:57:37] the concept of God himself into a man we
[1:57:40] called Christ
[1:57:45] Jesus it was a
[1:57:49] theophonic sended into a theophonic
[1:57:52] he says watch he had
[1:57:54] eyes like you see but a better eye it
[1:57:58] didn't I'm sorry it didn't have eyes
[1:58:00] like you see a better eye didn't have
[1:58:02] ears like you hear a far better
[1:58:08] hearing Moses saw it when passed through
[1:58:11] the rock like that saw the back Parts
[1:58:13] said look like a man now did you
[1:58:17] know now I'm going to try to cut it off
[1:58:20] right here because I'm gonna uh
[1:58:22] the other stuff that I want to go into
[1:58:24] is going to take a little bit too much
[1:58:26] time but brother Brenham said Jesus had
[1:58:29] a beginning but God had no beginning all
[1:58:32] right are we together on
[1:58:34] that now in Luke 22 verse
[1:58:40] 37 Jesus speaking for I say unto
[1:58:43] you that this that is written must yet
[1:58:46] be accomplished in
[1:58:50] me and he was re among the
[1:58:53] transgressions
[1:58:55] transgressors for the
[1:58:59] things concerning me have an
[1:59:04] end you mean the things concerning Jesus
[1:59:07] have an
[1:59:11] end you see understand this now all the
[1:59:14] prophecy about Jesus and everything that
[1:59:17] he was to be he is to accomplish but
[1:59:19] once he's accomplished it he says I
[1:59:21] didn't come here to reveal
[1:59:25] myself I come to reveal who father
[1:59:29] father for if you've seen
[1:59:31] me you've seen my father because my
[1:59:34] father and I are
[1:59:37] one come on go beyond some carnal
[1:59:40] understanding right now and put on a
[1:59:42] spiritual thinking C get some
[1:59:44] spirituality about
[1:59:49] yourself everything concerning me will
[1:59:51] come to an and does that mean in in hang
[1:59:55] on hang on just Mikel came to the back
[1:59:58] office he said brother Ron man I'm ready
[2:00:00] to L latch on my seat belt I said Put it
[2:00:03] on tight because I'm going to I'm going
[2:00:05] to rock it out of here
[2:00:07] amen all the prophecy once it's
[2:00:10] fulfilled in
[2:00:11] Christ the Fulfillment of pro prophecy
[2:00:15] will be what swallowed
[2:00:20] up I want ask you when you go to heaven
[2:00:23] are you going to see Jesus only and the
[2:00:24] father is still on the throne
[2:00:29] somewhere Jesus said I did not come here
[2:00:32] to reveal myself but I came here to
[2:00:34] reveal him because the mystery of
[2:00:38] God is revealed in Jesus
[2:00:42] Christ once the Fulfillment of Christ is
[2:00:45] finished you will see only the fullness
[2:00:48] of the
[2:00:49] Father the three dispensations of God
[2:00:53] were God above us the fatherhood of God
[2:00:58] God With Us amanuel god with us then God
[2:01:02] in us the Holy Spirit the spirit of God
[2:01:06] in The Believer but now the alpha comes
[2:01:08] back to Omega God will come back to
[2:01:10] become the all and all and when the
[2:01:13] mystery of God is
[2:01:15] finished the father Son and Holy Spirit
[2:01:18] will be one
[2:01:24] in him is one body
[2:01:29] y he is not going to be God the Father
[2:01:33] throughout all
[2:01:35] eternity he's going to be Jehovah
[2:01:38] Elohim the self-existing one who has
[2:01:42] made himself revealed himself to his
[2:01:44] creation to his begotten yes amen you
[2:01:49] see once the prophetic scriptures
[2:01:51] concerning
[2:01:53] Christ are finished fulfilled guess what
[2:01:57] once you're
[2:01:59] redeemed there's no need for a
[2:02:02] redeemer once you're
[2:02:04] healed there's no need for a
[2:02:07] Healer once you are
[2:02:09] saved you have no need of a
[2:02:13] savior once your case is
[2:02:16] dismissed you don't need an advocate
[2:02:24] yes sir but God will never dwell alone
[2:02:27] again
[2:02:31] amen he will dwell with his seed
[2:02:34] throughout eternity who do you this say
[2:02:36] this is
[2:02:40] 1964 that's the way he
[2:02:43] was he was in the beginning by
[2:02:47] himself God dwelt Alone with his
[2:02:50] thoughts
[2:02:57] who were those
[2:02:59] thoughts his
[2:03:02] family his
[2:03:05] begotten oh my God God dwelt Alone with
[2:03:10] his thoughts he'll never do that again
[2:03:14] cuz his thoughts are being made
[2:03:16] manifest and that's why we are here we
[2:03:20] are right here this day is God
[2:03:22] fellowshipping with his thoughts being
[2:03:25] made
[2:03:26] manifest is that what God's doing with
[2:03:28] you he's fellowshipping with you why you
[2:03:31] are his thoughts made manifest he
[2:03:33] thought about a bride in laiaa guess
[2:03:36] what he was thinking about

[2:04:17] deep that's good
[2:04:19] stuff we

[2:07:46] Earth by a sex
[2:07:50] birth and the new birth is now the only
[2:07:52] remedy to bring you
[2:07:55] back to reunite reunite you with
[2:08:01] him and to reite

[2:08:26] place but you did down here you made
[2:08:29] mistakes down here in the first
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:36] place I was begotten in the mind of God
[2:08:39] I was eternal in his thoughts that's
[2:08:41] [Music]
[2:08:48] me you see the will of the father is
[2:08:50] redemption and
[2:08:53] restoration that none will

[2:10:03] waiting well waiting is one of those
[2:10:06] things
[2:10:08] that once it
[2:10:12] happens and they're they are
[2:10:15] there then all of this frustration

[2:10:41] soon without the baptism of the Holy
[2:10:44] Ghost you will never understand the word
[2:10:47] of God Heavenly places is the B the
[2:10:51] position of the believer in
[2:10:53] Christ two parts of redemption I'm going
[2:10:56] to close here I'm going to close
[2:10:58] here two parts to
[2:11:03] Redemption he said first part
[2:11:06] [Music]
[2:11:09] Calvary the lamb was
[2:11:12] slain gave his
[2:11:15] blood but even after Calvary there's
[2:11:17] another part of redemption
[2:11:21] who's
[2:11:22] worthy to take the book to loose the
[2:11:26] seals thereof no one in heaven and Earth
[2:11:30] was found worthy and John began to
[2:11:34] weep there was a voice behind him said
[2:11:36] weep not John for the lion of the tribe
[2:11:39] of Judah hath revealed he turned to look
[2:11:41] to see a lion and what did he see I saw
[2:11:44] a lamb yes having been
[2:11:50] slain the you
[2:11:55] see first part of Calvary second
[2:12:00] part is someone to take the
[2:12:03] book because no one was found worthy
[2:12:05] there was no re the the finishing part
[2:12:08] of redemption wasn't there I was bought
[2:12:12] but nobody claimed
[2:12:13] [Music]
[2:12:15] me the price have been paid but nobody
[2:12:18] came and got me out of the pond
[2:12:22] shop we're still in the pawn shop we're
[2:12:26] waiting to with the
[2:12:28] Redemption of our
[2:12:30] [Music]
[2:12:32] bodies so between the breach be
[2:12:35] spiritual now between the
[2:12:38] breach of the church ages and the
[2:12:43] seals it is that in between place
[2:12:46] because right now between Revelations 10
[2:12:49] and Revelations 11 is a
[2:12:51] breach do you understand it's an in
[2:12:55] between he said God can't come to
[2:12:59] Israel and revealed through the two
[2:13:02] prophets Moses and Elijah until the days
[2:13:06] of the Gentiles be
[2:13:09] finished he's finishing up right
[2:13:12] now and until you come into your
[2:13:15] position and take your place in the body
[2:13:17] of Christ and that only comes to you
[2:13:20] revealed to you by the Holy
[2:13:22] [Music]
