[25:07] Brother Josh, it been a long time since
[25:08] you sang a song special. I'm glad you're
[25:10] singing with them today.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Lord bless the bus.
[25:16] Uh before we sing this song, we just
[25:18] want to thank the Lord. Um
[25:23] last weekend,
[25:25] as you remember, Baron went to preach uh
[25:29] in Oregon.
[25:31] Um so we went with him, me and my wife.
[25:36] We left our family. Uh we say we're
[25:39] going to go support our pastor over
[25:41] there. And we had great service over
[25:43] there. And uh Sunday during the service
[25:48] while Baron was preaching, I got a call
[25:51] from my son Caleb over here that my son
[25:56] Aaron over there. After church here,
[26:00] they went to my brother-in-law with some
[26:02] brothers to fellowship and he fell and
[26:04] hit his back on the concrete.
[26:08] And it was worse terrible that they had
[26:12] to airlift him to the children hospital.
[26:16] And uh when they gave me the news where
[26:19] Ron was preaching, I went to brother
[26:22] Abel's office. I kneel down. I pray I
[26:25] said, "Lord, we didn't come here to
[26:27] feast. We came here to support your
[26:29] service. We left our kid under your
[26:32] protection. I want my son to be restored
[26:35] completely."
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. After Baron said finished
[26:39] preaching, I told him we prayed and uh
[26:43] over here they were praying too,
[26:45] brothers and sisters. Uh they were
[26:47] really praying and it looks like the
[26:51] more we're praying, the more the
[26:53] situation was getting better.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; You know, it's a head issue. So, uh the
[26:59] doctor kept saying that he's improving,
[27:01] he's improving. and my wife came back
[27:04] Monday morning and um uh I came in the
[27:08] afternoon and Tuesday they released him
[27:11] from the hospital as nothing ever
[27:14] happened.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; So we just want to praise God for that.
[27:23] [Music]
[27:26] The Lord is my shepherd.
[27:30] I shall not want
[27:36] in green pastures. He makes me lie down.
[27:44] He restores
[27:46] my soul
[27:49] and leads me on for his name.
[27:56] for his great name.
[28:02] Surely goodness,
[28:06] surely mercy
[28:09] [Music]
[28:11] right beside me all my days.
[28:19] And I will dwell in
[28:23] your house forever
[28:29] and bless
[28:31] your holy
[28:35] name.
[28:38] You prepare a table right before me
[28:47] in the presence of all my enies.
[28:52] [Music]
[28:55] Though the arrow flies
[29:00] and the terror
[29:02] of night is at my door,

[29:39] and bless
[29:41] your holy
[29:44] name.
[29:48] Even though I walk through the valley of
[29:50] the shadow of death,
[29:53] [Music]
[29:55] I will feel.
[30:04] Even though I walk through the valley of
[30:07] the shadow of death,
[30:12] you are on my side.

[30:24] the shadow of death,
[30:27] [Applause]
[30:29] I will fear all evil.
[30:38] Even though I walk through the valley of
[30:41] the shadow of death,
[30:43] [Applause]
[30:46] you are on my side.
[30:51] Surely goodness,
[30:55] surely mercy
[31:00] right beside me all my days.
[31:08] And I will dwell in
[31:12] your house forever.
[31:17] and bless
[31:19] your holy
[31:22] name.
[31:25] And I will dwell in
[31:29] your house forever
[31:35] and bless
[31:37] your holy

[37:57] [Music]
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Beautiful song. Beautiful song. Let me
[38:03] turn the service to brother Ron. He
[38:05] wants he's got a couple of things he has
[38:07] upon his heart before we change the
[38:08] order of the service. Brother Ron, turn
[38:10] the service to him. You're welcome.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you all this morning. I greet
[38:18] you in the lovely name of Jesus.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy to be a Christian.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God has given us the ISV
[38:25] in this hour.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; That we might see what's going on in
[38:28] this day because that's a blessing
[38:31] &gt;&gt; of all the people on this earth. God has
[38:34] got an elected predestiny. God bless
[38:36] you, brother Steve. Good to see you
[38:38] here. But God has gotten an elected
[38:41] group predestinated
[38:44] &gt;&gt; that they might see the things of what
[38:46] God is in doing in this hour. I I
[38:49] listened to the tape last night, Christ,
[38:51] the mystery of God revealed.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; My my my brother Brandham is stressing
[38:56] the the fact of what God is doing in
[38:59] this hour.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "Many times we see what God has
[39:02] done or we anticipate what God will do,
[39:06] but we miss what God is doing."
[39:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And he's doing
[39:10] things now.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody say now.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; It's happening right now.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word is continuing.
[39:17] The the the word is still unfolding and
[39:20] we thank God for that.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I bring you greetings from brother
[39:23] Abel and sister Hattie up there in in
[39:26] Portland. We had nice meetings with
[39:29] them. And uh um also brother DDA and
[39:34] sister Lesie Colite. We saw them the
[39:37] last night. They came up to Portland,
[39:39] drove up from the Seattle area and came
[39:41] up and met us and we had dinner and so I
[39:44] bring you their greetings and
[39:45] everything. But uh we have some some
[39:48] church things that we want to take care
[39:50] of this morning. Um and brother Russell
[39:53] Wallace has got a little something he
[39:55] wanted to say and make an announcement
[39:57] to the church. So brother Russell, if
[39:59] you'd come up here at this time. Amen.
[40:04] And uh just while he's coming uh I I had
[40:08] a bunch of stuff that I had to do
[40:09] yesterday. Had to go up to Prescott and
[40:11] do a bunch of work and everything and
[40:13] didn't get home until late uh yesterday.
[40:16] So I took the opportunity. We have a
[40:19] visiting minister who is from Congo. And
[40:22] so we're going to have him be
[40:23] ministering. So all of the Congalles and
[40:26] French-speaking people here will be
[40:28] doubly blessed because you'll hear it in
[40:30] French and in English. So the Lord bless
[40:33] you, brother Russell, if you would.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Good morning, saints. God bless you.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; So we're this is a chance to tell you
[40:45] how much we love you and how much we'll
[40:46] miss you in the future. Um three years
[40:50] ago when we started attending service
[40:52] here, our family was at a crossroads at
[40:54] the local assembly and this was a a
[40:57] really easy choice for us. Uh some of
[41:00] our oldest and dearest friends on earth
[41:03] are in this assembly. Uh there those are
[41:06] friends we Elizabeth and I chummed with
[41:08] when we were still single and uh
[41:12] precious old friends. Shortly after we
[41:14] were married, the Love All Clan came out
[41:17] of the uh wilderness after I think 20
[41:19] years out of fellowship and were coming
[41:22] to the fellowshipping with us in
[41:24] Prescott and actually we baptized there
[41:27] Tracy Kelly and Monica at little church
[41:30] in Prescott. So we became very
[41:33] inseparable friends with the Lovealls
[41:35] and and they were here and very very
[41:37] precious to us also. Brother Ron and
[41:40] Sister Sandy were old friends. Uh if we
[41:42] go way way way back
[41:45] when brother Ron was a young man that's
[41:47] a long time ago and uh brother Floyd
[41:51] Patterson was sending young men down to
[41:53] the uh church in Prescott to minister
[41:55] for us and brother Ron was one of those
[41:57] frequent flyers and brother Dennis
[41:59] McGary and those were very special times
[42:01] in our lives then also as I was a
[42:04] teenager you'd have been 25 probably
[42:07] just a young guy. Um, and then I think
[42:10] every young married couple in here has
[42:12] probably uh spent part of their youth at
[42:16] our place there at the ranch. And uh we
[42:20] consider them some of our dearest
[42:22] friends. Uh and even don't want to leave
[42:24] out Austin Dub here. He's not a young
[42:26] married, but he's like one of our kids.
[42:29] He's been very precious to us. Justice
[42:31] is married now. I'm available if you
[42:33] need an alleer to find you a bride. I
[42:36] can do it. You just deput deputize me,
[42:40] Austin. I can do that.
[42:44] So, God bless you each one. Brother
[42:46] George Moore has moved to our area to
[42:49] pastor the church there. And it's going
[42:51] to be an uphill pull and they're going
[42:53] to need lots of support, encouragement.
[42:55] I feel like that Elizabeth and I need to
[42:58] be there and just to support and
[43:00] encourage and help put our shoulder
[43:04] to the wheel there also. So we'll miss
[43:07] you. We sure love each one of you. I
[43:09] know that the scripture says this is
[43:10] something I can always if the devil
[43:12] tries to tell me I'm not a disciple of
[43:14] Christ. Scripture says by this will all
[43:16] men know that you're my disciple when
[43:18] you have love one for another. And I
[43:21] know that I love the brethren. So the
[43:22] devil can't ever tell me on that front
[43:24] that I'm not a child of God. So, on a
[43:27] lighter note, 2022 when we started
[43:30] driving down here twice a week is when
[43:33] they started the big project on I17.
[43:36] And I mean, I'm sure you've all been up
[43:38] that. It was just a zoo. Now, we're
[43:41] going back to the local church and
[43:43] they've just finished the whole big
[43:46] project there. So, alls I can say is
[43:47] it's really nice now for you to come
[43:49] visit us. The road's really nice and
[43:51] done and flex lanes and so come see us.
[43:54] We'll be back to visit you. God bless
[43:56] your hearts. We love you.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've enjoyed the Wallace family
[44:08] for their time while they've been here.
[44:10] And so, he's feels led of the Lord to go
[44:12] up there and and help out, put the
[44:14] shoulder to the wheel. So, we pray that
[44:15] God will richly bless them. We have um
[44:20] all of our school children are starting
[44:23] school here soon. So, what I would like
[44:25] to do is if all of the school children,
[44:28] if you are going to school and you're
[44:30] starting here soon or perhaps you've
[44:33] already just started, I don't know,
[44:35] depending on what school district, if I
[44:37] could get you to come up here, I want to
[44:39] pray over all of our children.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a hour that we live in right
[44:45] now. And if there's ever a time that we
[44:48] pray over our
[44:51] &gt;&gt; children,
[44:52] &gt;&gt; for God to watch over them and keep
[44:55] them.
[44:57] Yes. Just come on up here.
[45:05] My my
[45:08] That's a church in itself right there.
[45:11] Right there. Look at that.
[45:15] Wow. All the tall ones you stand in the
[45:18] back there so the little ones can be
[45:20] seen.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of you come up here and Yeah.
[45:25] Let's just so we can all see you. Yeah.
[45:29] Yeah.
[45:31] Get there. You guys come up here a
[45:32] little bit forward. You stand right
[45:34] here. Come here. Come on up here. Come
[45:36] up here closer. Come on. Yeah. Yeah.
[45:39] There we go.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Look at this group. Yeah, keep coming.
[45:45] Make room, you guys. Come forward a
[45:48] little bit. That's it. God bless you.
[45:52] Amen.
[45:54] What
[45:56] a responsibility.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; That we have as parents. The Bible says
[46:01] to raise up the children
[46:03] &gt;&gt; and the admonition and nurture of the
[46:06] Lord
[46:08] &gt;&gt; that when they grow up
[46:11] even if they shall
[46:13] stray they cannot stay.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; And it is our responsibility
[46:21] that we raise them up. We preach to them
[46:24] and tell them truth
[46:27] and we ask God to watch over them
[46:29] because you know what you children
[46:31] you're in the toughest time of school
[46:35] because you're in a time now when the
[46:37] teachers are teaching things that uh you
[46:41] know
[46:43] uh just that are so far leaning away
[46:47] from what we believe. Amen.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; And so that's extremely hard because now
[46:52] I have such little time with you, just a
[46:56] couple hours each week to help you keep
[46:59] balanced. Remember that the
[47:03] Satan used the channel of reasoning in
[47:06] the Garden of Eden
[47:09] and he is also known as the tree of
[47:11] knowledge.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; So you go to school and you're eating of
[47:15] knowledge. That's good. It's good to
[47:17] learn to read and to write, but what we
[47:20] must do with all of our reading and
[47:22] writing and all of the learning that you
[47:24] get in school, we must have that
[47:27] balance. Otherwise, if we lose our
[47:30] balance and you get equilibrium,
[47:33] which you have a problem with your
[47:36] equilibrium and you get dizzy and you
[47:39] can't walk straight. That's what happens
[47:41] when we're not well balanced. So, God,
[47:45] help us. as the ministry here. And we're
[47:48] not talking about just the ministry
[47:49] behind the pulpit. We're talking about
[47:51] the pulpit at home.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're talking about responsibility
[47:55] because I need your help.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; That all of you will do your due
[48:01] diligence at home and teach your
[48:04] children
[48:05] &gt;&gt; because what an hour that we live in.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Where it is the darkest of all hours.
[48:11] We're in these these young children
[48:14] here.
[48:15] Oh God,
[48:18] &gt;&gt; I pray that
[48:21] he will keep his hand of blessing
[48:24] &gt;&gt; upon each one.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Watch over and keep them. And so I'm
[48:31] going to pray over all of you right now.
[48:33] And I want you all as parents and as
[48:37] loved ones and just part of this
[48:39] congregation.
[48:41] I would like you to put your antenna up
[48:44] &gt;&gt; and be directing your prayers this
[48:47] direction
[48:49] &gt;&gt; and pardon me if I turn my back to you
[48:53] but that I turn towards them because I
[48:56] want to pray over them. So if you would
[48:58] let's just all pray you all young people
[49:01] bow your heads close your eyes. Heavenly
[49:04] Father,
[49:05] Lord, as pastor of this church and of
[49:09] this flock, this assembly that you have
[49:13] made us overseer.
[49:16] And Father, what a responsibility we
[49:18] have not only as the ministry at this
[49:21] church, but as a
[49:24] as a father in the gospel.
[49:27] Oh God, I look at these young people.
[49:32] And Father, I pray that you will watch
[49:34] over them and keep them. You did not
[49:38] isolate your disciples from the world,
[49:40] but you did insulate. You said, "I send
[49:44] you out as sheep among wolves."
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Father God, these two, these children
[49:52] are going to be going to school. They're
[49:55] going going to be learning, eating from
[49:58] the tree of knowledge. I pray, oh God,
[50:00] that you will help them to always have a
[50:03] balance of the gospel
[50:05] &gt;&gt; and of learning from education.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; So, Father, I pray a special blessing
[50:12] upon each one of them. watch over them
[50:15] and keep them, oh God,
[50:18] &gt;&gt; because Father, without your help,
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Father, none of us would make it.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; So, we're asking the grace of God once
[50:28] again
[50:29] &gt;&gt; to come down, be their portion,
[50:32] &gt;&gt; watch over them, Father,
[50:35] &gt;&gt; and keep them. Let the parents use
[50:37] wisdom at home.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; When they're sitting around the table or
[50:42] they're on family vacation or they're
[50:45] doing something with their children, may
[50:48] they always remind them of your ways
[50:51] because your ways are above our ways and
[50:53] your thoughts are above our thoughts.
[50:56] So, Father, I pray over these
[50:59] &gt;&gt; young people,
[51:01] &gt;&gt; the congregation, if you should tar
[51:04] &gt;&gt; another decade, we don't know, Lord. We
[51:07] believe you're coming soon,
[51:09] &gt;&gt; but if you should terry, these are the
[51:13] church of tomorrow.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; So, Father, I pray.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; I bless them.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; I raise my hands over them right now and
[51:23] I say, "Oh, God,
[51:25] keep them father in the center of thy
[51:27] perfect will
[51:29] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may go back and
[51:37] have your seats now. God bless you.
[51:39] Thank you young people.
[51:42] Amen.
[51:44] Amen.
[51:47] Yes.
[52:02] What a responsibility.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Last night
[52:09] about 1:30 in the morning, I woke up
[52:11] very suddenly.
[52:14] I got out of bed. I sat on the chair
[52:18] in the corner of our bedroom there and I
[52:21] just sat and prayed and meditated on the
[52:24] things of God.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; And I just was going over things and I'm
[52:29] praying and praying for the church and
[52:31] praying for guidance. I'm praying that
[52:33] the Holy Spirit would just take this
[52:37] this little assembly that we have here
[52:39] and draw us closer to him.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Bring us back together.
[52:45] around his word
[52:47] &gt;&gt; to not just talk about it
[52:49] &gt;&gt; but to get into it.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; That we might
[52:54] &gt;&gt; partake of the word of God.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; And that it might manifest in our lives.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says, "Be not a
[53:02] forgetful hearer."
[53:05] &gt;&gt; It's not coming here to church and just
[53:06] hearing and getting knowledge. Let us go
[53:09] beyond knowledge. Let's go beyond carnal
[53:12] understanding, but down into the place
[53:15] &gt;&gt; where the Holy Spirit
[53:17] &gt;&gt; gets a hold of your soul and illuminates
[53:20] you.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; And allows you to fall in love with him
[53:24] &gt;&gt; because it is your love
[53:26] &gt;&gt; for God that keeps you.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; And remember, you do not keep yourself.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; You are kept by the power of God. Let's
[53:34] stand together. We have brother Freddy
[53:36] Massi is a pastor from Lumbamashi Congo
[53:42] and um uh he's here and so I took the
[53:46] liberty and brother Emmanuel Baya is
[53:49] going to be his translator. So I'll turn
[53:51] the service to brother Robert. We'll
[53:53] sing a song here as we change the order
[53:55] of the service. Be very attentive.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a little hard translator.
[54:02] you have French, English, this, that,
[54:04] but I'm sure you all be very, very
[54:06] patient. And uh, Brother Johnny Greeny
[54:09] sent me a note. Brother Ron, I pray
[54:11] you're locked and loaded and ready and
[54:13] I'm under. I said, oh my, I I I didn't
[54:16] even tell him.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; I knew something was up.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; But,
[54:23] uh, we love you guys this morning, but
[54:26] most of all,
[54:28] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Robert. This is
[54:31] my desire. Let's sing it as the minister
[54:34] comes this morning. This is my desire.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; This is my desire
[54:42] [Music]
[54:44] to honor
[54:47] you,

[54:55] I worship you.

[55:06] truly Lord I want to praise you with you
[55:11] praise.

[55:18] it in
[55:20] as the minister comes this morning. Lord
[55:23] I give you my heart.
[55:26] Oh Lord, I give you my heart. I give you
[55:30] my soul.
[55:32] I live. I live for you alone.
[55:38] Every breath I take, every moment I'm
[55:42] awake.
[55:45] Lord,
[55:47] lift your hands as a declaration and
[55:49] sing. Lord, I give you my heart.

[57:42] love.
[57:46] It all
[57:48] you
[57:51] Jesus. We're dependent upon you, Jesus.
[57:56] We're depending on you,
[58:00] Jesus.
[58:02] We're depending on you,
[58:06] Jesus.
[58:08] We're depending on you.
[58:12] Depending on you.
[58:15] [Music]
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord bless you.
[58:29] [Music]
[58:30] &gt;&gt; If you may sit down just a little bit.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; May God be blessed.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:42] [Music]
[58:45] It's for me a privilege to be here this
[58:47] morning
[58:51] &gt;&gt; in the church of brother Ron.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; I'd been here I believe is in 2022.
[59:07] And I was here in this church
[59:14] &gt;&gt; and I wanted to visit the Sunset
[59:15] Mountain.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; I went up there as well as to Sabino
[59:25] Canyon
[59:31] &gt;&gt; and I wanted to make sure that these
[59:32] places are real.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] And afterwards I came here
[59:44] &gt;&gt; and they really are befriended with
[59:45] brother Ron
[59:47] [Music]
[59:53] &gt;&gt; and he had come to our place many times
[59:59] &gt;&gt; over there in DRC.
[1:00:05] And ever since we've remained friends
[1:00:11] yet again today, it's a privilege for me
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; and that he grants me the opportunity to
[1:00:20] speak behind his pulpit.
[1:00:29] I'm bringing greetings from the
[1:00:30] brethrens over there in DRC.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; They greet you all in the name of Jesus.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; They have greet you in the name of
[1:00:41] Jesus.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Do you accept?
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Do you accept?
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:00:55] Would
[1:01:00] you allow me to bring back the greetings
[1:01:01] from here over there in DRC?
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; They really love you. They are your
[1:01:10] brothers.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; One of these days the limitation of
[1:01:19] languages is going to be ending.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:01:29] I was reading brother Brennham being
[1:01:31] asked what language are we going to have
[1:01:33] over there in the millennium
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; and he told them it's not going to be
[1:01:39] English
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; and it's not even going to be American
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; but God's going to give us a celestial
[1:01:52] language
[1:01:56] And in that language, everybody going to
[1:01:57] be able to listen to what everybody
[1:01:59] says.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; So may the Lord be blessed for that.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; And for me this morning, I have a small
[1:02:12] exhortation.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; I'd already preached to you a little
[1:02:17] bit.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; And I understand this church here.
[1:02:29] And today I thought that I'm not just
[1:02:31] going to repeat myself but give a small
[1:02:32] and little exhortation
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; as we stand we can greet each other and
[1:02:40] read the scriptures.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; You can greet each other
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; as we are going to start reading the
[1:02:50] word.
[1:02:54] We are in revival,
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; the revival of the seven thunders,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; the revival of the bride.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; So we are indeed in a revival
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; and Christianity is a firm warm
[1:03:18] handshake.
[1:03:20] I've seen that it was a little bit
[1:03:21] lukewarm, but
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Christianity it's aime
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; it's a firm warm handshake.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:03:40] We're going to go towards the word.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read in two places.
[1:03:51] The first one's going to be in Ephesians
[1:03:53] chapter one.
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; The third verse all the way to the
[1:04:04] eighth verse.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; The second scripture is going to be in
[1:04:13] the book of Romans.
[1:04:19] Roman 8 verse 19.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Let's start with Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read gladly and be as glad
[1:04:37] as I'm reading it.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And I believe everybody has brought
[1:04:42] their Bibles.
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:04:49] whether it's a digital or is it is the
[1:04:51] book.
[1:04:53] [Music]
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon mentioned that we have
[1:04:58] to bring our Bibles as we go to church.
[1:05:00] Yes, sir.
[1:05:02] Let's read.

[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; We're going to be doing reading.
[1:05:18] from verse three.
[1:05:38] Blessed be the God and father of our
[1:05:40] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:05:42] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:05:44] places in Christ.
[1:05:57] according as he has chosen us in his in
[1:06:00] him before the foundation of the world
[1:06:02] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:06:04] before him in love
[1:06:14] having predestinated us unto the
[1:06:16] adoption of children by Jesus Christ.
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:22] to himself according to the good
[1:06:24] pleasure of his will.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; To the praise of the glory of his grace,
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; wherein he has made us accepted in the
[1:06:40] beloved.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; In whom we have redemption through his
[1:06:48] blood.
[1:06:55] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:06:57] riches of his grace.
[1:07:10] wisdom and prudence,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:07:18] his will,
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; according to his good pleasure, which he
[1:07:28] hath purposed in himself.
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:34] Hallelujah.

[1:07:37] the fullness of time,
[1:07:39] skeletons.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; You might gather together in one all
[1:07:53] things in Christ, both which are in
[1:07:55] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:07:58] him. Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:05] And our second scriptures is in the book
[1:08:08] of Romans,
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; chapter 8.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; We're only going to read uh one verse,
[1:08:16] verse 19.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:31] For the earnest expectation of the
[1:08:33] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:08:35] of the sons of God.

[1:09:07] live by bread alone,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; but of every word that comes out of the
[1:09:14] mouth of God.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And the mouthpiece of God is a prophet.
[1:09:24] Oh God, in this hour you have sent us a
[1:09:25] great prophet.
[1:09:32] It is this great prophet Elijah of
[1:09:34] Malachi 4,

[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; for your children have driven long
[1:10:52] distances.

[1:11:00] May you bless them.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; May you bring the Holy Spirit
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; and the great physician of God
[1:11:10] that he may come and just bless us.
[1:11:16] God now bless the reading of the word in
[1:11:18] our hearts
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; I don't know what I may read
[1:11:28] but you know the need of your people.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; May you bless them Lord for the glory of
[1:11:34] God

[1:11:50] I like put as script as a title.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what the the pastor told
[1:11:57] me.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. You told me that afterwards
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; he was going to sit down next to the
[1:12:08] sister.
[1:12:15] So I like to give a title
[1:12:20] [Music]
[1:12:21] the great mystery of adoption
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; and the manifestation of sons of God
[1:12:33] and it's on those titles I'm going to
[1:12:36] speak a little bit
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; even if I do not finish
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; the brother pastor is going to continue
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; and he's a great doctor of God.
[1:12:55] So this morning my title is
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; the great mystery of adoption
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; and the manifestation of sons of God.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; So God God has called us to this
[1:13:17] message. Amen.
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:24] And he has called us for a purpose.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:31] And this purpose is to adopt us and to
[1:13:34] grant us over there in heaven.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And in every ages.
[1:13:44] And God was calling out a church
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; and a church of good quality,
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; a church without spot nor wrinkle.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And that church is you guys here. It's
[1:14:03] us over here. Wait.
[1:14:07] So we must be that church over there
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; because time is running outens
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:22] and brother says we are at the
[1:14:24] dispensation of the fullness of time.
[1:14:26] Okay.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; And this is the dispensation where we
[1:14:31] and we find ourselves in.
[1:14:37] So that this may help you where I'm
[1:14:39] going towards.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And the church where we in is not a
[1:14:47] church that we have created.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; It's a church that has been there since
[1:14:55] Pentecost.
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:02] And that trail has started over there in
[1:15:04] the upper room
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:10] when God had given the Holy Spirit to
[1:15:12] the apostles and the remainder that was
[1:15:14] over there.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; May you say amen to that. Amen.
[1:15:22] And is then that the church had started,
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; the church that we are,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; the church that you are,
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; the church that is right here amongst
[1:15:33] us,
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Phoenix
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; here in Phoenix,
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; that church that started back there over
[1:15:40] there in the upper room
[1:15:45] when God had given the Holy Spirit to
[1:15:47] the apostles.
[1:15:49] May you say amen to the word.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; May you say amen to the word.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; So since then the church had started
[1:16:06] and when Paul came as a messenger of the
[1:16:09] age of Ephesus,
[1:16:12] the church had already fallen.
[1:16:18] It was fallen because of the choosing of
[1:16:20] the deacons. They had done then
[1:16:27] they had chosen Nicholas from Antioch.
[1:16:29] They came with his own thinking
[1:16:35] and the spirit of the devil had come
[1:16:37] into the church
[1:16:41] and already then the church had fallen.
[1:16:47] But Abraham said that the messenger
[1:16:49] comes at the end of the age.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; The messenger never came in the
[1:16:55] beginning of the age.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; He comes at the end of the age
[1:17:02] and it brings correction within that age
[1:17:07] and Paul came
[1:17:11] and we can see then there it was the
[1:17:13] church of Ephesus.
[1:17:14] Can you say amen to that?
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; From 53 to 70,
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; from then it was the church of Ephesus.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; And God has sent his word
[1:17:34] and gathered all the elected
[1:17:37] and they believe that word then. Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; So
[1:17:43] God had sealed them.
[1:17:45] and place them aside.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And afterwards it was rain
[1:17:59] and it was from 70 to 312.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; And the messenger was given, Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; had called out people
[1:18:11] and God had sealed them.
[1:18:14] and bless them aside.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I'd love for you guys to understand
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; that God is forming his church by the
[1:18:26] baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:18:39] Because when the Lord Jesus Christ had
[1:18:40] come,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; the Jews had rejected him which was the
[1:18:46] Messiah.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; So God had placed them in the feast of
[1:18:52] trumpet
[1:18:58] and the trumpet only brings
[1:18:59] difficulties, war and and wars.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; But as the Gentiles
[1:19:09] We had believed that he was the Messiah.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; God was very pleased.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; And he's put us on the feast of
[1:19:18] Pentecost.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; So the the the the feast of the Holy
[1:19:26] Spirit.
[1:19:30] So he continued to give us the Holy
[1:19:32] Spirit since the beginning.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. You say amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; So the church of the Gentiles
[1:19:43] has been formed by the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:49] You cannot be in that very church
[1:19:50] without the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:53] Can you say amen to that?
[1:19:56] After
[1:19:58] Ranius, it was it was Martin from tour
[1:20:02] [Music]
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; and Martin preached
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; from 312 I believe to 606
[1:20:13] and those that believed
[1:20:15] the elected
[1:20:17] God had sealed them
[1:20:20] and then put them aside as well.
[1:20:24] And then God has sent Columbus.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; It was the year of Thai Tower.
[1:20:32] In that age,
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; God has sent a message.
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; And that message had to go from 606
[1:20:46] from uh 1520
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; to 1520.
[1:20:53] And those that believe in that very age,
[1:20:57] God has sealed them
[1:20:59] and put them aside, placed them aside
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. Of course,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; do you understand?
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; God had sealed them by the Holy Spirit
[1:21:16] because God calls this church with the
[1:21:18] word and sealed them with the Holy
[1:21:20] Spirit.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:21:26] The church had already fallen over then
[1:21:28] the Nia council
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; with the Catholic church and a lot a lot
[1:21:37] of thing that was just not good.
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; God had to rise once again his church
[1:21:47] and reform his church.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Restore his church. Amen.
[1:21:54] restoration.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; So he restored his church.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:21:59] You
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; may say amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:22:07] when God had given the message to
[1:22:08] Luther,
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; it was a message of justification.
[1:22:21] So the people that was receiving the
[1:22:23] message of Luther
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; there to go all the way to
[1:22:29] sanctification and then they stopped.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Justification
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; justification and they stopped
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; and stop over there.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; They were predestinated to go all the
[1:22:45] way up until justification. Amen. Can
[1:22:48] you say amen?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; and God has sent John Wesley.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; It was from uh
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; uh 17 uh when was
[1:23:06] John Wesley.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; John Wesley.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:10] He came after Martin Luther
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; and his age was from 1750 to 1906
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; and God had given a message to John
[1:23:27] Wesley
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; and the message of John Wesley
[1:23:33] and for those people there
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; and there to go all the up until
[1:23:40] sanctification and stopped there.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Who can say amen to that?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; And it stopped over there.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; They just couldn't go beyond that.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Luther had already given justification.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; They had stopped there.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:01] Johnesley.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; After John Wesley,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; God sent a message to the Pentecostals.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen."
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Who is listening?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Who is following?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Who is following?
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; May you raise your hand? I'm going to
[1:24:23] see.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much.
[1:24:32] Now God has sent a message to the
[1:24:33] Pentecostals.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; those
[1:24:41] that the message was given to
[1:24:48] bring the people all the way to the
[1:24:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; and the restoration of the gifts.
[1:24:56] And when they go all the way there, they
[1:24:58] stopped.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; They just said to stop right then and
[1:25:05] there.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; But another time to come afterwards.
[1:25:10] Hallelujah.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; A time to come afterward.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; It was the time of William Random.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; It is our time indeed.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; It is our time.
[1:25:25] It is our age.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; It is the age of William Random.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; It is the age of the bride.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; I believe that you are the bride.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Are you the bride?
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Are you the bride?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Are you the bride?
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Are you the bride?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Are you the bride?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are the bride. We're not
[1:25:50] Pentecostals.
[1:25:53] Abraham
[1:25:56] says that we are beyond Pentecost.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; God called Luther
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; and gave him a message of justification.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; The justification
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; of justification.
[1:26:11] He called Wesley and gave him a message
[1:26:13] of sanctification.
[1:26:18] And when it was time for the Ponte
[1:26:20] coastal,
[1:26:21] all this Ponte coastal that you see over
[1:26:23] there,
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:31] they had given them a message. But that
[1:26:33] message had only got to come all the way
[1:26:35] to the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; and the gifts,
[1:26:40] the speaking in tongues,
[1:26:44] the healing of the sick,
[1:26:46] all these gifts there.
[1:26:51] It was a message with the restoration of
[1:26:53] the gifts.
[1:26:55] Can
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; we say amen to that?
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Now when William Brandham comes.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; We are beyond 1906.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Now he comes with a message.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:17] When he was born, he was born under the
[1:27:19] the the the under the pillar of fire.
[1:27:22] The pillar of fire was
[1:27:24] inside the house
[1:27:26] around 4 in the morning.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was uh was being
[1:27:31] born
[1:27:33] and it was showing
[1:27:36] that with him the Messiah was going to
[1:27:37] come on earth.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Now when it was over there in the river
[1:27:44] Ohio,
[1:27:46] In 33
[1:27:50] then his ministry started
[1:27:55] angels came down. Do you say amen
[1:27:59] and told him
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; as John the Baptist
[1:28:04] was sent
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; with a message
[1:28:08] as a forerunner
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; on my first coming
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; year as well. I'll give you a message
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; to become the forerunner
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; of my second coming
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; and in the formation the formation's
[1:28:26] rooms
[1:28:31] God had given him the vision seven
[1:28:34] vision all the way to the end of the
[1:28:35] world
[1:28:38] but I'm not going to talk about that
[1:28:47] But I'm going to speak about us that has
[1:28:49] been called with the message of William
[1:28:51] Brennham.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; So us
[1:29:01] are not like the Lutheran
[1:29:06] Methodist.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; We're not like the Methodists.
[1:29:11] We are not like the Pentecostals.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; You may shake each other's hands
[1:29:24] and we are the bride of Jesus Christ. We
[1:29:27] are the bride.
[1:29:29] You may do it. You may do it. Is it hard
[1:29:33] to shake each other's hands?
[1:29:38] We are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Abraham says,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; "We are not Pentecostals.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; We are not in the age of less.
[1:30:01] We are beyond Pentecost.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; We are beyond Pentecost.
[1:30:09] We are way beyond Pentecost.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; But what is God asking from us?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; He had required justification with the
[1:30:23] Lutheran.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; He had been required sanctification with
[1:30:28] the Methodists.
[1:30:31] It had been required the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; We're the Pentecostals.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; But us, what is God requiring us?
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; What is he asking us?
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Us,
[1:30:45] God is asking
[1:30:48] to go
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; all the way to adoption.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; We have to be adopted.
[1:31:01] We don't have just a regular baptism of
[1:31:03] the Holy Ghost. I'm going to
[1:31:04] demonstrate.
[1:31:06] But
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; we have to go beyond
[1:31:10] the adoption.
[1:31:12] Now, if we go back to the epistle of
[1:31:13] Paul, well, the epistle of uh
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Paul,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; if we go back to Paul
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; in Ephesians
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; chapter one,
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Paul says that God has chosen us before
[1:31:28] the foundation of the world.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; God had elected us before the foundation
[1:31:33] of the world. Can
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; you say amen?
[1:31:40] That's when he had elected us.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; But
[1:31:47] we have been predestinated
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; to become the sons of adoption.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; This is what it says.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; We're not like the others.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; We have been predestinated
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; to become his sons of adoption.
[1:32:06] Do you have anybody that can say amen to
[1:32:08] that?
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; So, I'm What does uh what does it say?
[1:32:16] I'm going to read a little bit that I
[1:32:17] can. What is adoption?
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; What is adoption?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Because God must adopt us. Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; God must adopt us.
[1:32:35] For us is not just a simple Holy Spirit
[1:32:42] for us is not just a simple
[1:32:43] sanctification that he gives.
[1:32:48] For us is just not sanctification that
[1:32:50] he gives.
[1:32:52] It is not just a simple Holy Spirit that
[1:32:54] he gives.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Excuse me to use the word simple
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; but is the truth.
[1:33:03] God, him.
[1:33:05] He calls us
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; to go beyond and all the way to
[1:33:11] adoption.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Because Paul says,
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; being predestinated
[1:33:18] to become his children of adoption.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; He had predestinated us
[1:33:28] to be his children of adoption.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:33] He has elected us first
[1:33:35] us
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; because we're at the end of the gospel.
[1:33:42] We are the end of the gospel.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; It is the closure of the gospel.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; There is not going to be another
[1:33:54] messenger coming afterwards.
[1:33:57] There's not going to be another message
[1:33:58] to come.
[1:34:00] There's nothing that's going to come
[1:34:02] afterwards.
[1:34:03] One of says that we are the last ones.
[1:34:08] They're seeing the history of the world
[1:34:10] coming to pass.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; We have seen all the promises being
[1:34:19] fulfilled.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; The the the promises of the American
[1:34:26] pope
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; has been fulfilled. Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; It's been fulfilled.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; We have seen now
[1:34:37] Madam Aris was uh dressed
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; the the the day of of the the
[1:34:44] inauguration
[1:34:46] and she was wearing purple.
[1:34:49] It is the truth.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; But Abraham was a prophet.
[1:34:55] It can say nothing more but just just
[1:34:58] the truth.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; And when you look,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; the way that she was dressed,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; the lady was dressed in purple.
[1:35:09] He really prophesied upon California,
[1:35:12] even Los Angeles,
[1:35:14] that Los Angeles was going to sink in.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; We believe that that is the truth.
[1:35:22] Brother can only say the truth.
[1:35:26] If we are here this morning is because
[1:35:27] of brother
[1:35:29] said,
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:44] As we see, we see that the world is
[1:35:46] going to come to an end and there's not
[1:35:47] going to be another messenger
[1:35:49] afterwards.
[1:35:50] There is not going to be another one.
[1:35:53] Nobody's going to come be after us.
[1:35:56] Brother Brandham is the messenger to
[1:35:58] bring the church
[1:36:00] into the rapture in the rapture that is
[1:36:03] coming.
[1:36:05] It is the messenger that he's going to
[1:36:07] do. As you say amen to that,
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; as you are seated here in this building,
[1:36:14] in this church of brother Ron
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; with the messenger, brother Brandham,
[1:36:24] if there is an heaven, you're going to
[1:36:25] make it there.
[1:36:29] If there is a God, you you are going to
[1:36:31] see him.
[1:36:33] You are going to see that very God
[1:36:36] because this is a true message
[1:36:39] that has been given.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; It's a message that is bringing us into
[1:36:46] the rapture
[1:36:49] in the changement or the change of the
[1:36:50] body
[1:36:52] in the adoption.
[1:36:57] Abraham said that the fullness of
[1:36:58] adoption,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; it is the changing of the body.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; It is the changing of the body.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; But God
[1:37:09] with the word and the message and the
[1:37:13] opening of the seal, the third pool.
[1:37:16] [Music]
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; It gives us adoption.
[1:37:23] So the Pentecostal cannot receive
[1:37:25] adoption.
[1:37:26] Do you say amen?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; The Methodist neither.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; The Lutheran cannot.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; All the others cannot
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; but us
[1:37:40] because of the opening of the seals
[1:37:42] because the opening of the seals brings
[1:37:45] Jesus on earth.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The opening of the seals
[1:37:51] brings Jesus down on earth.
[1:37:56] And Jesus it is the perfection.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; And Paul has said in Hebrews 11
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; without us
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; the others
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; since Paul
[1:38:10] in the Old Testament even
[1:38:16] they couldn't come all the way to
[1:38:17] perfection without us.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Abraham had to come.
[1:38:24] The cloud had to come down.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; The cloud had to come down.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; The cloud is right here at your place.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; It's way far from the Congo, but it's
[1:38:42] very close from me here in Arizona.
[1:38:47] The cloud came down
[1:38:51] in Sen Mountain.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; I went there and I've realized it's the
[1:38:56] truth.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] So all that coming down and as
[1:39:06] descension of the fullness of the word
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; is leading us to adoption.
[1:39:13] Resurrection

[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:20] Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; I believe that you will say amen.

[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:32] God is asking for us, requiring us to go
[1:39:35] all the way to adoption.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; But to go all the way to adoption,
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; it goes to a certain order.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Justification,
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; justification,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; sanctification,
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; sanctification,
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:59] and then there you are children.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; So Pentecostal just babies
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; but we are not babies. No,
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; we have to climb up the pyramid
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; from faith, add virtue
[1:40:20] and
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; to add knowledge
[1:40:24] and from to longsuffering

[1:40:30] and patient to add
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; and from uh
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; what is
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; goodness. good, godliness,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; and from there are the uh brotherly
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; brotherly love.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; And at that point, we're going to have
[1:40:52] perfection.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, the the headstone.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; And the headstone
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; is going to crown the the pyramid of
[1:41:04] your life.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:41:09] You are sealed.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Adopted.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You are adopted.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; you must first have a birth.
[1:41:28] And when you're born,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; you're starting to

[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; patience, patience,
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; godliness from godliness,
[1:41:53] brotherly love
[1:41:56] and then the headstone
[1:41:58] come to crown the pyramid.
[1:42:02] Abraham says,
[1:42:05] "God called his church the same way that
[1:42:07] he calls his children."
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; The headstone,
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; the seven thunders
[1:42:19] crown the pyramid
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; of the imperfect ages.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; your life
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; and then he adopts you
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; allow me to
[1:42:40] read something here.
[1:42:47] How is this church that we have?
[1:42:55] Because when you're in the church, you
[1:42:56] got to understand what kind of church
[1:42:57] you're in.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; What is God requiring for that church?
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; We can read.
[1:43:09] It is condemnation by representation.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; It is uh 1960
[1:43:19] November 13th.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; November.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:43:30] Now I'm going to start little by little
[1:43:32] my subject and I'm going to stop.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:43:37] We can read
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; is going to be uh 1960
[1:43:43] November 13th
[1:43:47] paragraph 60.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; It says there
[1:43:58] [Music]
[1:44:07] And we believe there must be a church in
[1:44:09] these last days
[1:44:13] religion
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; rather it's a it's a hybrid religion
[1:44:20] 1960
[1:44:23] 1960 and we believe
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:28] that there should be a church in these
[1:44:30] last days.
[1:44:33] that we'll receive
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; both the former and the latter reign.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; It will scatter throughout the world.
[1:44:50] In this Laudian church, in this Leician
[1:44:53] age,
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; it will be a church
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; that is called back
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; the original faith
[1:45:04] in God.
[1:45:08] It will be a church
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; that'll have Jesus Christ walking in it.
[1:45:18] Amen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; It'll have Jesus Christ walking in it
[1:45:29] manifest
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; manifesting himself.
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; The shout of the king
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; will be in it.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:45] The shout of the king
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; shall be in it.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; So in this right here, there's the shout
[1:45:53] of the king.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; There's the shout of the king.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; What is that shout?
[1:46:07] But when explain the mystery of the
[1:46:10] rapture,
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; the Lord himself shall come down,
[1:46:15] descend
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; with a shout
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; with a voice
[1:46:22] and the sound of the trumpet,
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; and the dead in Christ shall rise.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to talk about the shout.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:35] The shout,
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; the shout
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; he comes down, descend with a shout,
[1:46:41] with the voice
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; and the sound of trumpets.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; And the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:46:50] Then I that remain.
[1:46:57] We're going to be changed and uh
[1:47:01] and gathered with those that were dead.
[1:47:05] to go to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; So the shout is this message
[1:47:12] said that the shout
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; it is the message
[1:47:17] that gathers the people.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:21] When we say
[1:47:24] this message here, in the tapes,
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; in the books,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; in the applications, in the internet,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; it is the shout.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; That's the shout that gathers
[1:47:39] that gathers the the bride,
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; the bride that you are.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; You are that very bride.
[1:47:50] You are here because of the shout
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; there's the reason why you're God of the
[1:47:54] year
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; and that very shout
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; it is the time for to prepare the soul
[1:48:03] lamping time.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; It is the time to trim our lamps.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; It is the very lamp. It is that very
[1:48:13] shell that we have.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; We are the true virgins.
[1:48:20] We are not the foolish ones.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; We are the true one. The true virgins.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; We are the true virgins.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; We are not foolish virgins.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; We have taken our lamps.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; And there is oil in that very lamp.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; We have oil in the lamp.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; And the oil is the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; We have the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:48:49] Paul said,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; "If someone doesn't have the spirit of
[1:48:53] Christ,
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; it doesn't belong to him.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; But you have the spirit of Christ.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Brother, you have the spirit of Christ.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Brother, you have the spirit of Christ.
[1:49:04] Sister, you have the spirit of Christ.
[1:49:06] Sister, you have the spirit of Christ.
[1:49:08] You belong to him.
[1:49:11] You are his children.
[1:49:16] And it's by that spirit that it births
[1:49:18] us.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; By his spirit that he births us.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; God has birthed as our mothers have
[1:49:36] birthed us. Excuse me.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; God has birthed us. Yes.
[1:49:43] I would like to read
[1:49:45] now we're going to go fast as the timing
[1:49:47] is going towards the end.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read adoption what it is.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Quickly here.
[1:50:09] No.
[1:50:12] Okay.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Brother says
[1:50:29] yeah brother said brother Ron said that
[1:50:31] if we can't find if we can just
[1:50:33] translate directly here.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:50:38] I am uh teaching to people that already
[1:50:40] been taught.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:50:47] who can doubt about it?
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; This is what Paul said.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; It is a scripture of Paul.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; It is the scripture of Paul.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; This is what he has taught the church.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Placing her in her position.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:06] The church that we have,
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; it is a church that has been placed.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Everybody have their place.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Brother, you have your place.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; You have your place.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; You have your place.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; You have your place.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; You have your place.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Because our age,
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; it is the age of placing. Amen.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; We may say amen to that.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; It says that the book of Ephesians
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; is like the book of Joshua.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:51:51] Why?
[1:51:53] Because those people
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Paul Moses has taken them out of Egypt.
[1:52:01] Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; You say amen to that.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; So when they had did the Exodus,
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; he circumcised them
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; and the cross read the Red Sea.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Moses m the rock
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; and they were moving forward.
[1:52:26] Remember that day.
[1:52:29] They remember that Moses circumcised
[1:52:31] them
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; when they came out of Egypt.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; I love when you guys say amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; I love what you you say amen.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; So when they walk in in the wilderness,
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; circumcised,
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:55] [Music]
[1:52:56] Miriam had taken the the the tempering
[1:53:00] and they danced
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; and they saw their enemies sunk in the
[1:53:05] sea.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; But what happened afterwards?
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Moses did a lot of miracles. Can you say
[1:53:12] amen?
[1:53:16] The pillow fire and the cloud was with
[1:53:18] them.
[1:53:21] They ate the mana coming down from
[1:53:22] heaven
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; and they they ate the the birds.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; There were unbelievers.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; There was Kora and Din
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; and Abram.
[1:53:50] They were against Moses.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; But they were already circumcised.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Are you remembering that?
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; They were already circumcised.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; They were going to the land.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; They were in the wilderness.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; But they all died at Kadesh.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; They all died in Kadesh.
[1:54:16] But when Joshua comes
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; with a new ministry,
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Moses has crossed them through a
[1:54:26] miracle.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; But Joshua him
[1:54:33] crossed them with the word
[1:54:36] with the ark of the Lord.
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:41] So the the older
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; the Levites
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; and continue marching towards Jordan.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; You got to really pay attention.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Joshua also circumcised them.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Circumcised them.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Even though they were already
[1:55:09] circumcised by Moses.
[1:55:12] But when they come to the Jordan,
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Joshua circumcised them once more.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Because there and then they have to
[1:55:21] cross to go in the land.
[1:55:24] He circumcised him once more. He does it
[1:55:27] once more. He He had circumcised him
[1:55:30] once more.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; I would rather speak in English. It
[1:55:36] would have been uh
[1:55:39] so you can see
[1:55:42] before it crossed into the land.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; But it didn't they didn't cross with
[1:55:47] miracles. Then
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; the Levite had the ark.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; And when they put one foot on water,
[1:55:56] the Jordan parted
[1:55:59] and the cross.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; He had circumcised them
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; for the second time.
[1:56:11] And they are crossing by the word
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; and now it is in the land of the promise
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; and
[1:56:22] there he places them.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; That is the placing.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; So Benjamin is here.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Dan is right here.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Zabulon is right here.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Reuben is here.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Reuben is here.
[1:56:40] every one of them there.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; He was placing each and every one of
[1:56:46] them in their respective places.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; After the second circumcision,
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; you have anybody that can say amen to
[1:56:55] that. Amen.
[1:57:00] Brother says that real lesson we're
[1:57:02] giving them with types.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:07] the thorough lesson.
[1:57:10] We have to give them with types.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; So as we see the children of Israel
[1:57:16] coming,
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Moses had circumcised them.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; They across the Red Sea in the desertion
[1:57:25] with that circumcision.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; They couldn't hold
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; they started just uh messing with Moses.
[1:57:34] Amen. You say amen.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:57:40] all of them died
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; in Kades.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; They needed a new ministry.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; There there was a need for a new
[1:57:51] ministry.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; It is the ministry of Joshua.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; That is to put them into the blessing.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; You say amen to that.
[1:58:05] with that very ministry
[1:58:07] once more circumcised them.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; And now they can enter the land. When
[1:58:15] they enter the land,
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; now it's not for that one to be over
[1:58:19] there and go wherever they will
[1:58:23] their mother when they were born.
[1:58:28] That's right.
[1:58:32] They had pronounced the name of the
[1:58:33] place where they were supposed to be
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Zabulon.
[1:58:37] You near the sea.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; God. God
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; some place there.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; And every one of them.
[1:58:47] I believe that you remember
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; the prophecy of his Isaiah
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; when Jesus went to the land of Zebulun
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; after the death of John the Baptist
[1:59:06] and he said that the prophecy of of
[1:59:07] Isaiah had been fulfilled
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; land of Zeon.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Galile and Galileo of the
[1:59:16] Gentiles
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; and the people that were sitting in
[1:59:20] darkness
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; and saw a great light
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; and Jesus was that very light.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:59:44] In the evening time
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; there shall be light.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; In the evening time there will be a day.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; There there will be no nor day nor
[1:59:57] night.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; But
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; but in the evening time

[2:00:11] Pentecostal
[2:00:17] day
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; it was a twilight day was neither day or
[2:00:24] night.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:00:28] But when we come here with the message
[2:00:30] of William Brandham,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; it is the light
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; that is light.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; That is light.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Is light that have been turned on.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; The others have stayed in just the the
[2:00:48] luring, but it wasn't the message.
[2:00:52] I'm not sure if you're going to say amen
[2:00:54] to this.
[2:00:55] But what you must so really understand
[2:00:58] and then what I'm going to explain,
[2:01:01] but because now
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about adoption.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; It's going to allow me to stop here
[2:01:08] somewhere.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:15] We as well
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; they have received how many baptism?
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; How many circumcisions?
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Two.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; The first one with Moses
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; to cross the Red Sea.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Are you following?
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Are you following?
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; And the second one
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; by Joshua.
[2:01:43] And they've been able to cross the
[2:01:44] Jordan
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; and there
[2:01:48] everybody were there at their places.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; This apostle,
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; you are apostle.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; They put you at your place.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; You are a doctor.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; You're at your place.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; That is the message of placing.
[2:02:09] The messenger brother Brenham
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; who understands that
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; who understood that
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; okay
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; I am careful of time
[2:02:26] and I believe you have understood
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; it is like us as well
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; when we come into the message of William
[2:02:37] Renham
[2:02:40] If I had a board, I could have drawn it.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; When you come in the message, William
[2:02:49] Brandham,
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; follow carefully.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; You believe Jesus Christ as your
[2:03:00] personal Lord and Savior.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:05] You confess all your sins from your
[2:03:07] birth all the way to that very baptism.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; May somewhere say amen to that.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; And when you were repented and they
[2:03:22] baptized you
[2:03:24] and you believe this message William
[2:03:26] Brandham,
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the message William
[2:03:29] Brandham.
[2:03:32] I'm not talking about the Pentecostal
[2:03:33] message.
[2:03:38] I'm a pastor in the church. There was a
[2:03:40] brother did a lot of years and said,
[2:03:42] "Bro, brother Freddy,
[2:03:46] I've been baptized over there. I believe
[2:03:49] it was the Catholics or something like
[2:03:51] that." I said, "No, no, no.
[2:03:55] You have to be baptized by this
[2:03:57] message."
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:00] You must be baptized in this message
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; so that you may receive
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; the real salvation.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Now when you when you were baptized,
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; you are justified.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen to that?
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Did you say amen?
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; I haven't heard. Yeah. Amen.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; So, brother one baptized you
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; at the river
[2:04:41] and
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; you are justified.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; But you have come right.
[2:04:52] It must be that you go forward.
[2:04:57] So you can I arrive at the baptism of
[2:04:59] the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; First sanctification.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; God must sanctify you. The Bible says
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; seek sanctification
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; which without which
[2:05:16] nobody will see God. That's right.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Ram says that when somebody is justified
[2:05:29] He still left the roots of sin.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; If you go to Hebrews chapter 10, chapter
[2:05:38] chapter 10 verse 2 and three,
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Paul calls it the desire to sin.
[2:05:47] Now calls it the roots of sins.
[2:05:52] So it's still there in your soul.
[2:05:57] Have you listened?
[2:05:59] Have you understood?
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody that been justified,
[2:06:04] he still have a poor habit.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; No, I'm going to teach you as a pastor.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Not like a doctor. Just like a pastor.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; If you understood.
[2:06:24] So you are justified after the baptism
[2:06:28] and God forgot all of the sin.
[2:06:32] But the roots of sin are still in your
[2:06:35] heart.
[2:06:37] You got to ask
[2:06:40] how is he going to be removed?
[2:06:43] Brother says
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; is going to be removed.
[2:06:48] When you're going to come at the altar
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; and look at your own soul,
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; all the lies,
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; all the criticism,
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; all the bad things,
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; the bad hearts,
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; the just uh indifferences,
[2:07:08] all of those things remain over there in
[2:07:11] your heart.
[2:07:13] And you go near,
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; you go there a bar
[2:07:21] and at where I live, the the bar is just
[2:07:24] next to our road.
[2:07:30] And you can smell the the smell of uh of
[2:07:34] alcohol.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; And if I could drink, it would have been
[2:07:38] nice.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; It's still in your heart.
[2:07:43] Who can may say amen to that?
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; You still want to fight.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; You want to fight against your wife.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; The bad habits
[2:08:01] are still in your heart.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; In your heart.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; I'm indicating there because brother
[2:08:09] says um
[2:08:13] In the heart there is an empty place.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; In that very place there there is your
[2:08:21] soul.
[2:08:25] And if somebody dies and he has 73 kg,
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; we're going to find after his death he
[2:08:35] will be with 72 kilos.
[2:08:40] It means that difference there of 1
[2:08:43] kilo.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; But you have to work on your soul.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. Over there. Have you
[2:08:50] understood?
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Have you understood? Amen.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Have you understood?
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not really listening. I'm not
[2:09:02] hearing.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Have you understood back there? Back
[2:09:06] there.
[2:09:10] Somebody has been justified.
[2:09:13] You still have some bad habits.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; You just indifferences, a bad heart
[2:09:19] and adultery thoughts.
[2:09:22] He still can steal. Yeah.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; You see,
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; it's very important.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; You say amen. Is that
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; excuse me, children? Yeah.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; I I I've seen that they pray for the
[2:09:40] kids. I'm adding my prayer to the kids
[2:09:42] as well.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Well, yes.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; I love that God blesses you.
[2:09:48] But sometime the children love to lie a
[2:09:51] lot.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Children love to lie. Yeah.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; No, you have to stay there.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; lies.
[2:10:06] Lord,
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; the better hearts. Lord
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; indifferences
[2:10:16] brother says now brother Bam said that
[2:10:19] is the the the work of the heart.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; No no the soul
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; the soul.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Wait.
[2:10:29] You got to be there until the old man
[2:10:31] dies.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; You got to set the altar until the old
[2:10:37] man dies. Amen.
[2:10:43] Rather run build this church so they can
[2:10:45] come and pray.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; You may come here.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Don't always stay home.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; No, you're here
[2:10:58] until the old man dies. My my
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; the old man,
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:11:06] the the old lady
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; that was just answering in all kinds of
[2:11:13] ways
[2:11:14] must die
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; at the altar.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Have you understood?
[2:11:22] Have you understood?
[2:11:24] Who understood?
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; The old man must stay there.
[2:11:30] The intellect all the other things got
[2:11:33] to stay there.
[2:11:37] And then when you're really sanctified
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; is then that you may ask the Holy Spirit
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; and he comes down
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; and he baptizes you.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; It is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; It is the new birth.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:00] But
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; when you're born again,
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; you are just a son
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; baby.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Have you understood?
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; But us
[2:12:18] and that's where the Ponteosal had to
[2:12:20] stop.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; When we were born again,
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; we start running.
[2:12:30] And to faith we add virtue.
[2:12:33] We keep on climbing up the pyramid
[2:12:36] to virtue, knowledge, knowledge,
[2:12:38] temperance, temperance.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; It is, godliness and then brotherly
[2:12:43] love.
[2:12:45] Then
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; the stone
[2:12:50] comes and crowns
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; the pyramid of your life.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; A barb says,
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:58] He says,
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; "One of the mysteries that have been
[2:13:05] revealed
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; by the seals,
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:13:12] without any sensations, feelings.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; But the fullness of the person of Christ
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; must also dwell in you."
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen."
[2:13:27] You say amen.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:33] So you see
[2:13:37] when you reach the top of the pyramid
[2:13:42] said that it was not required of those
[2:13:44] people those people of Paul of Irene all
[2:13:47] these other people the people of Luther
[2:13:50] of Wesley all these other people the
[2:13:53] Pentecostals
[2:13:55] they were never required
[2:13:58] what has been required of us for us,
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; we must reach all the way to the top of
[2:14:04] the pyramid
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; and there we are adopted.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; But Ram says
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; it is the real baptism of the Holy
[2:14:16] Spirit.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Who can say amen?
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; You see
[2:14:22] we have had the Holy Spirit here.
[2:14:25] You see the first circumcision
[2:14:30] but when we come at the end of the
[2:14:31] pyramid
[2:14:34] we receive a second circumcision.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Now for that very one I have to read so
[2:14:41] that I may not say brother said yes.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; We're going to go fast over here.
[2:14:58] I'm going to go fast so you can go and
[2:14:59] dwell.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand how a man comes
[2:15:06] to adoption.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; I think it's here.
[2:15:10] No, no. No, no, no, no.
[2:15:16] Okay. And the quickly please.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; It's really quickly.
[2:15:24] 62 uh October 14th
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; 341
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; these fellows wasn't required what these
[2:15:39] fellows are
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; this wasn't required what this was
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; but
[2:15:57] But he brought his church up
[2:16:03] the same way.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; He brought his church up the same way.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; So there are seven things.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; There's faith,
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; virtue.
[2:16:22] You see
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; come up,
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; knowledge,
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; temperance,
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; patience,
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; godliness,
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; brotherly love,
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; and you add brotherly kindness
[2:16:42] and
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost.
[2:16:49] Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Come come comes upon you in the true
[2:17:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Then
[2:17:10] God leaves in a tabernacle
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; called
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; the building.
[2:17:19] the leaving a tabernacle of the living
[2:17:22] God's dwelling in place.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Have you understood that?
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Have you understood?
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; It gives you the true Holy Ghost baptism
[2:17:38] though you had received a Holy Ghost
[2:17:39] back there,
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:17:43] But that baptism
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; had made sure that you grew
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; and accumulate all of these virtues
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; up until you reach adoption. Amen.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; And brother calls it in the statue of a
[2:18:05] perfect man,
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; the true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:18:12] the ceiling.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Or the ceiling.
[2:18:17] [Music]
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. Or the ceiling.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; And there you are sealed.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; No more
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; and you are adopted.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; You are manifested.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Brother was a adopted son.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; He was a manifested son. Amen.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; So Paul says
[2:18:45] that
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; the nature was waiting was waiting
[2:18:50] groaning.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; When God had created our father Adam
[2:19:00] was a god.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; He could walk on water.
[2:19:08] It could it could also order or command
[2:19:10] a bull.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; It could it could master the wind
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; and he was obeying his word.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; He could say to the bull or the lion
[2:19:27] lion move from there
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; and go the other way.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; And the lion was obedient.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; He could walk on water.
[2:19:37] because it was God.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; It was the sin that has uh disallowed
[2:19:44] him from that that power.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Did you understand?
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; And he fell he fell into sin.
[2:19:57] Sickness came.
[2:19:59] Death came.
[2:20:02] You started fearing lion.
[2:20:05] And when the line comes, we have to
[2:20:06] bring a a gun.
[2:20:10] But brother was not asking for a gun.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; He said to the bull,
[2:20:16] the bull of the living God,
[2:20:18] I must go pray for a man over there.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; And the bull also bowed down.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; The ground
[2:20:34] had been two great great adoption in the
[2:20:37] Bible in the church. The very first one
[2:20:41] it was the one of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:20:47] and Jesus Christ after obedient
[2:20:51] to God
[2:20:55] he went to the mount of transfiguration
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; with Peter, James and uh John and when
[2:21:01] he was there
[2:21:05] Moses and Elijah's work had come as well
[2:21:09] and his apparel was shining
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; and God said this is my only son
[2:21:18] begotten son

[2:21:42] when God says to a man to to a man to
[2:21:45] listen to him
[2:21:48] it means don't listen to me.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:21:53] That's what he said for Jesus. Hear him.
[2:21:58] He
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; is my beloved son. adopt.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; He had adopted Jesus
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; in the mount of transfiguration.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody that can say amen to
[2:22:08] that?
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; It was one of the great adoptions. Okay.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; The second one
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; is William Brandham.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; William Brandham.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; It's William Brandham.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; That message is standing standing in the
[2:22:26] gap. in the message sitting in the gap
[2:22:33] said, "We're sitting in the table."
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; And the cloud had come down
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; and I gathering him up
[2:22:41] and and a voice said,
[2:22:45] "This is my prophet."
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "This is my beloved
[2:22:51] sonet."
[2:22:54] But he said, "This is my prophet.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; You must hear him as well."
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Believe bring the people to believe you.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; If you're sincere
[2:23:11] and you bring the people to believe, not
[2:23:13] even cancer can stand against it.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; It's all brother. Bring people to
[2:23:23] believe you.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; You got to bring the people to believe
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; to believe you. You
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; that they believe you.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; You see,
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; do you see
[2:23:42] it was an adopted son?
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; He was a manifested son.
[2:23:49] manifest.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a manifestation of
[2:23:53] the of a son of God,
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; but he was a waving sheath,
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; showing that we were going to come to
[2:24:06] that very maturity as well.
[2:24:12] You cannot come to adoption.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the last quotes.
[2:24:19] You cannot come to adoption
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; without being born again.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; First of all, the Holy Spirit.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; First of all, the Holy Spirit.
[2:24:38] That's why the very very first thing
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; when you come here
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; in this very church
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; the William Brandham
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; of William Brandham
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; the of brother Ron
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; the first thing
[2:24:54] it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; if you do not have it
[2:25:00] you you can't forget about it
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; because it is the Holy Spirit spirit
[2:25:06] that gives you a new body.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Spirit that's going to
[2:25:15] bring you back from death.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; In the message where the Holy Ghost was
[2:25:23] given,
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; it's only those that have the Holy
[2:25:27] Spirit,
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; they're going to make it to that very
[2:25:31] rapture.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There there is others that come
[2:25:38] I I I know that here you're very gentle.
[2:25:42] But back home
[2:25:45] I speak like a pastor.
[2:25:49] Some people come to the church to sing.
[2:25:52] We sing.
[2:25:53] It's not bad to sing.
[2:25:56] It's not bad to dance. But
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; the most essential thing,
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; They had a question during times Paul's
[2:26:09] time.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Have you received the Holy Spirit since
[2:26:13] you believed? Amen.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; I see that you really don't want to
[2:26:23] shake each other's hand.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; You're scared of COVID.
[2:26:32] [Music]
[2:26:35] We greet each other.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Have you received the Holy Spirit since
[2:26:42] you believed?
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Can you shake?
[2:26:46] The person next to you? Have you
[2:26:50] received the Holy Spirit
[2:26:53] since you believed?
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:58] Have you received the Holy Spirit
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; since you believed?
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; That is the question.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Because when you have the Holy Spirit
[2:27:12] that you are born again,
[2:27:16] that you are then son of God
[2:27:20] and then you can start growing.
[2:27:24] But if you're a bad child,
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; there are a really bad child.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; There are really bad children.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; And the bad children,
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; oh my my
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; oh my.
[2:27:43] [Music]
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; You have a five to 10 minutes left here.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:27:52] Now,
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; have you understood? Well,
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; that's when you are a good
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; son.
[2:28:05] In the Old Testament, when a son was
[2:28:07] born,
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; so they were recruiting tutors.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; And professor. a professor
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; to uh teach the son
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; because he was doing everything by
[2:28:28] himself.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; So a son had to be born.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; It is you here.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; And when you're born again
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; and that the tutor,
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; comes
[2:28:51] and he start to teach you
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; and he see that you're really nice son.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; So he text you
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; the father.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; That very son was his son since his
[2:29:14] birth.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. But
[2:29:23] he had to manifest some good characters
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; so that he may be adopted.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; And place him
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; and put him at work.
[2:29:40] So the signature even on the check
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; was as valid
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; of the signature of the father.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham was that very man.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; He was adopted.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; God told him,
[2:30:06] "Ask whatever you want.
[2:30:13] Tell Addie to ask whatever she wants.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Why was that?
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Because he himself was an adopted son.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; It is there that all of us must reach
[2:30:29] the church of brother Ron.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Do not waste any time.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; You got to travail.
[2:30:37] do the the traveling of the soul.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; Go forward. Receive the Holy Spirit. But
[2:30:44] says,
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; "Do not stop at justification."
[2:30:50] But says,
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; "Do not stop at sanctification."
[2:30:55] But says,
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; "Do not stop at the baptism of the Holy
[2:30:59] Spirit.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; You got to go on and move forward.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; You got to continue advancing.
[2:31:08] I believe you can say amen to that.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; So you can receive adoption.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; We are going to heaven.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; We're not here just circling around.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; We are going to heaven.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; And heaven is not like earth.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:31:36] God is requiring the Holy Spirit
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; and is there
[2:31:45] because where people the young people
[2:31:51] they they download pornography in the
[2:31:53] internet
[2:31:55] and all the bad things.
[2:31:58] You're not going to make it to heaven
[2:31:59] like that.
[2:32:02] The message brother,
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; it is a message of godliness
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; and purity.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; But you must receive the baptism of the
[2:32:14] Holy Spirit.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; If brother one can give me just five
[2:32:21] minutes, five minutes.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Have you understood? Well,
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; who understood?
[2:32:32] who understood
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; in adoption third part we're going to go
[2:32:39] quickly
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; paragraph 66
[2:32:46] God had given his children the new birth
[2:32:52] must give you the new birth
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; if you come to this church
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; God must give you the new birth
[2:33:02] If he doesn't give it to you,
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; I believe he must do so.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; But says, "And then
[2:33:14] God has given his children new birth
[2:33:17] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; they came right near it.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; And when they cleaned theirelves up,
[2:33:31] clean their sars off.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; Through Nazarene.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; Through Nazarene,
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; there were people of sanctification
[2:33:45] and pilgrimage of holiness. Then
[2:33:50] come through the experience of Pentecost
[2:33:53] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; And it was the Holy Ghost,
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; the restoration of the gifts,
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; then went forth speaking with tongues
[2:34:08] and interpret tongues
[2:34:11] and given gifts
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; of healing, miracles, signs, wonders
[2:34:21] began to accompany them. Now
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; they are children.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; They were born again.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; There were children.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; There are God's children.
[2:34:45] And they are positionally in Christ.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; They become children by
[2:34:51] by birth.
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; And the new birth
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; and the conversion itself
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; is the Holy Ghost.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; You're not even converted until you get
[2:35:09] the Holy Ghost.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 82.
[2:35:15] looks to me
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; like we are at
[2:35:19] [Music]
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; we are at the end time
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; and God is adopting
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; setting positionally
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; in church
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; in the body of Christ.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:39] Now
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; there's not going to be too many
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; he'll put in there.
[2:35:54] I'm I'm going to tell

[2:35:59] with.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; But because many are very lazy. So
[2:36:08] they're not going to make it there.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Have you understood?
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Some love drinking, eating. It's not
[2:36:17] bad.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; But we have to have the traveling of the
[2:36:23] soul
[2:36:24] because it must travel because the soul
[2:36:26] is the one that's going to make it to
[2:36:27] heaven.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; There's three minutes left.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read
[2:36:40] hear him uh preach here in Phoenix,

[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; The placing of a son.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; We are here so that God may place us.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Got a place.

[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; We are here to receive
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; the placing.

[2:37:54] circumcisions.
[2:37:55] Amen. Amen.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; You have seen the two circumcisions.

[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; They bring him to a certain place
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; and there is a ceremony in front of the
[2:38:30] angels
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; and place him in his position,
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; meaning that he's in the body of Christ.
[2:38:42] Hello.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; So that person has authority.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; You have authority.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; People are suffering.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; People are sick.

[2:39:04] Where are these people in Lumashi?
[2:39:07] Where are these people in Lumashi?
[2:39:12] And we we got to seek them. Look for

[2:39:52] this very same thing is going to get
[2:39:54] fulfilled.
[2:39:56] There's going to be a power
[2:39:59] that will get in the church.
[2:40:04] It is getting into already now the Holy
[2:40:07] Spirit
[2:40:09] going to anoint the people
[2:40:12] so much that they're going to pronounce
[2:40:14] the word.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; It will even create
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; even there.
[2:40:21] We haven't seen the power
[2:40:23] as such that is getting into the church
[2:40:26] now.
[2:40:28] I know that it's done.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; Tell this mountain.

[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; will shut their mouths.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; The nature was waiting.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; People were sick.
[2:41:25] For who?
[2:41:27] who can heal them
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; everybody is focused in their job.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; But I believe
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; that we must know
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; that God is waiting for us to be placed.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; May God bless you
[2:41:51] &gt;&gt; and give you the Holy Spirit
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; and bring you to adoption.
[2:41:57] and bless your work
[2:42:00] and your lives
[2:42:03] and you may be different
[2:42:06] of everybody that is here in Phoenix.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; There's a very reason why the seals were
[2:42:12] given.
[2:42:13] Thank you very much, brother Ron.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, the people. May the
[2:42:18] Lord bless you.
[2:42:23] Here
[2:42:29] you go.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's all stand
[2:42:38] together.
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on up here. Stand to my
[2:42:43] right.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; Why do I have my translator stand to the
[2:42:48] right?
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham always had the angel to
[2:42:52] the right.
[2:42:54] I'm waiting for
[2:42:56] him.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. Thank you
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; for having the patience
[2:43:05] this morning
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; because for a man to come
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; and speak such a
[2:43:13] mystery of the adoption
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; in one hour with a translator
[2:43:20] is almost impossible.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; So you were very perseverant.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:43:29] Um and uh we know that the adoption go
[2:43:33] ahead and just start playing some
[2:43:37] adoption is our pleasing.
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says when Abraham got
[2:43:43] out of his position,
[2:43:46] power and authority.
[2:43:50] So the church of the living God
[2:43:53] has got to come to the place of
[2:43:55] adoption.
[2:43:59] But hey, your new birth doesn't provide
[2:44:02] that.
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; That's just a son. And though he be heir
[2:44:08] to all things,
[2:44:11] he's no different than a servant,
[2:44:14] but he's under tutors and governor
[2:44:18] until the appointed time.
[2:44:20] How many believe God's got an appointed
[2:44:22] time?
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; This is our appointed time.
[2:44:27] for the sons and daughters
[2:44:30] to hear the word of God
[2:44:33] and to receive it
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; and to manifest
[2:44:39] not just agree with it
[2:44:42] to say amen
[2:44:44] but to walk in the light.
[2:44:47] Amen. Amen.
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[2:44:51] What a blessing it is to
[2:44:56] each and every one of you.
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; I say God bless you.
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; And I don't have to ask you
[2:45:08] because you can say
[2:45:11] many times
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; when you say can you say
[2:45:16] uh give me something to say amen about.
[2:45:21] preach the word say amen. You don't need
[2:45:24] to tell me
[2:45:28] something inside.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; Just going to say amen.
[2:45:34] I know you can
[2:45:37] say
[2:45:39] amen.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; You have the possibility.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; But man, give me something.
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you've all been so
[2:45:55] appreciate that.
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You're

[2:46:53] There are victories to be won.
[2:46:59] Give me power.
[2:47:03] Every
[2:47:04] hour
[2:47:06] to be true.
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; How many
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; want to say that brother Emanuel did
