[1:02:24] e
[1:02:54] e
[1:03:24] e
[1:03:54] e e
[1:04:44] yet she still had a
[1:04:47] testimony she said oh that my Lord would
[1:04:51] go to Israel because there's a prophet
[1:04:53] in Israel that could heal my lord of his
[1:04:59] disease she had a testimony she had the
[1:05:02] right attitude she had the right Spirit
[1:05:06] though she was taken from her family
[1:05:08] though she was taken for her loved ones
[1:05:10] she still had a conviction she still had
[1:05:13] a a a a a a way about her that that that
[1:05:17] she remembered the prophet in the land
[1:05:21] of
[1:05:22] Israel it reminds me of of of of that
[1:05:26] that black slave that brother brandham
[1:05:28] talks
[1:05:29] about and back then they would go
[1:05:31] brother brandham says that they would
[1:05:33] buy him like used cars brother Brenham
[1:05:36] said this he said man uh God made man in
[1:05:40] his own image but man made man a
[1:05:46] slave and so brother Brenham talks this
[1:05:48] says about this story and he says here's
[1:05:50] this man and and they were going and
[1:05:52] they were going to buy themselves a
[1:05:54] slave and everybody else they had to
[1:05:56] beat him get to work hurry up and get
[1:05:59] things done they would whip him they
[1:06:01] would have to have to beat him real good
[1:06:03] to get them to do something uh you know
[1:06:06] a lot of times it doesn't work the best
[1:06:08] especially when you're at work you know
[1:06:10] you think you have to have some kind of
[1:06:12] uh bad attitude with somebody to get
[1:06:14] them to work harder no whenever you're a
[1:06:17] leader you want to bring the best out in
[1:06:20] that person you don't have to put
[1:06:22] somebody down to get something out of
[1:06:25] them but we want to lift them
[1:06:27] up that's how you get the best out of
[1:06:30] somebody you tell them what they're good
[1:06:32] at you tell them who they are not what
[1:06:34] they're bad at don't tell them what
[1:06:37] they're what they're doing wrong on a
[1:06:38] daily basis no you lift them up to a
[1:06:41] higher
[1:06:43] standard and so here was this there was
[1:06:46] one and you all know the story he had
[1:06:48] his shoulders back his chest out brother
[1:06:50] Brenham said they didn't have to whip
[1:06:52] him in order to get him to work says I
[1:06:54] want to buy that guy
[1:06:56] oh he's not for sale well what do you do
[1:06:59] with him do you feed him differently you
[1:07:01] give him a little more protein no he
[1:07:03] eats with the rest at The Gallows do you
[1:07:05] does he sleep a little better than
[1:07:07] everybody else no no he sleeps with all
[1:07:10] the other slaves well what's so
[1:07:12] different about this guy this guy had
[1:07:15] the right attitude this guy had the
[1:07:17] right Spirit even though he was a slave
[1:07:20] in a foreign country and they come to
[1:07:22] find out that his dad and his family
[1:07:24] were were were were tribal Kings or
[1:07:27] whatever it was and he said he he he he
[1:07:30] acts his life and he lives his life out
[1:07:33] as the son of a king if you and I we've
[1:07:37] been born slaves to loudest ear let me
[1:07:40] tell you something we don't got to live
[1:07:42] like everybody else in L AA but we can
[1:07:45] live as Sons and Daughters of the
[1:07:49] king thank you Lord and it starts in our
[1:07:53] own homes am it starts in our own
[1:07:56] bedrooms it starts with our own family
[1:08:00] amen because when they see us living the
[1:08:03] right kind of life watching the right
[1:08:05] kind of things whatever it may be
[1:08:07] they'll want to live that same kind of
[1:08:13] life so here she was she had the right
[1:08:16] attitude and she said uh uh this little
[1:08:20] Maid she said to her mistress would God
[1:08:22] my Lord were with the prophet that is in
[1:08:25] Sam Maria for he would recover him of
[1:08:28] his leprosy he would have a way of
[1:08:33] recovery he would have a way of
[1:08:36] atonement it wasn't him himself that was
[1:08:40] able to recover the person but he would
[1:08:43] have a way and an advice to give to this
[1:08:46] man who was stricken in
[1:08:49] sin to come and to wash and be clean of
[1:08:52] his
[1:08:53] leprosy so just follow along and one
[1:08:56] went in verse four and told his Lord
[1:08:58] saying thus and thus and he went and and
[1:09:02] and into the land of Israel and he took
[1:09:04] a letter to the King this is
[1:09:07] amazing she said go to the prophet but
[1:09:10] he went to the king yeah and no doubt it
[1:09:13] was a a form of respect for the king a
[1:09:17] form of respect to say hey uh I'm coming
[1:09:20] into your land but I'm coming peaceably
[1:09:23] here's a letter I don't have any other
[1:09:26] uh and uh other motives or objectives
[1:09:28] behind this thing here uh I just want to
[1:09:31] get healed of my
[1:09:33] disease but when the king received a
[1:09:36] letter he rent his clothes and and he
[1:09:39] said who am I I can't give life I can't
[1:09:42] take life away I can't heal this man of
[1:09:45] his disease he it was just interesting
[1:09:47] as I read it like why was his first
[1:09:50] thought not to go to Elisha the prophet
[1:09:53] it's because he didn't have a connction
[1:09:55] ction with Elisha the prophet it's
[1:09:58] because he didn't have a relationship
[1:10:00] with Elisha the prophet he was just
[1:10:03] doing his own
[1:10:07] thing and so we see that
[1:10:10] whenever non came and finally he made it
[1:10:14] to the prophet's
[1:10:17] house and my I I wondered this as I read
[1:10:21] and I thought how did Elisha know that
[1:10:25] the king rent his
[1:10:27] clothes and what he did because Elijah
[1:10:30] Elisha sent on to him hey hey why did
[1:10:32] you rent your clothes why did you get so
[1:10:35] angry why did you just send them to me
[1:10:37] you should have brought them to me in
[1:10:39] the first place why why are you so angry
[1:10:41] no doubt he saw it in a
[1:10:44] vision because there's nothing that's
[1:10:46] hid from
[1:10:53] God so we see that he came
[1:10:57] before before Elisha and he came to the
[1:11:00] man of God's
[1:11:04] house and no doubt here he is non he's
[1:11:09] got his he's got his horses and he's got
[1:11:11] his chariots and he's got all his his
[1:11:14] he's got a host of people with him and
[1:11:16] he's got 10 rment of of of clothing and
[1:11:20] he's got silver and he's got gold and
[1:11:22] and Men he's coming with a bunch of a
[1:11:25] bunch of presents to say thank you and
[1:11:28] and and he's already ready for his
[1:11:30] healing and and he thinks that Elisha is
[1:11:32] GNA come to the door and he's going to
[1:11:33] greet him and he's going to bow with
[1:11:35] respect and Elijah Elisha sends his
[1:11:42] gazi amen this guy sends his servant to
[1:11:47] the door and I traveled all this way
[1:11:50] doesn't he know who I am doesn't he know
[1:11:54] that I'm a respect person within the
[1:11:56] church doesn't he know that I have a
[1:11:59] position within the church who doesn't
[1:12:01] he know who I am doesn't he know who I
[1:12:05] belong to and he carries himself with an
[1:12:08] authority and demands respect of the
[1:12:11] people and Elisha sanses his servant to
[1:12:14] the
[1:12:15] door this disrespectful guy who does he
[1:12:20] think he is so now gazi comes with a
[1:12:24] with a uh a word he says go to the
[1:12:27] Jordan
[1:12:28] River and I want you to wash I want you
[1:12:31] to dip seven
[1:12:33] times the Jordan
[1:12:36] River you want
[1:12:40] me an honorable
[1:12:42] man a man of
[1:12:45] Valor a man that comes in and out before
[1:12:48] the king you want me to go and dip in
[1:12:51] that dirty
[1:12:53] river that dirty muddy river full of
[1:12:57] insects full of dirt full of grime
[1:13:00] there's way cleaner Waters where I live
[1:13:04] isn't that the way it is with us as
[1:13:06] Believers
[1:13:07] sometimes we think I know the way I know
[1:13:12] how it should be done I have a better
[1:13:15] idea and and and I think that we should
[1:13:17] do this and I think that this is the way
[1:13:20] but really this is the way the truth and
[1:13:23] the life
[1:13:26] and so we get so caught up with our own
[1:13:28] thoughts and our own ideas and our own
[1:13:31] agendas that we think how we want to do
[1:13:34] it is the right way but yet God has sent
[1:13:37] a prophet messenger in this day he
[1:13:40] didn't send some other kind of servant
[1:13:42] he sent a prophet messenger he didn't
[1:13:45] send the the messenger servant to you
[1:13:48] but he sent the messenger himself and he
[1:13:51] knocked on your door you didn't come
[1:13:53] looking for him but he came looking for
[1:13:56] you and he came and he told you a way to
[1:14:00] approach God a way to talk to God a way
[1:14:04] to have the right mental attitude
[1:14:06] towards the promises of God that they
[1:14:08] might come to pass in our lives he
[1:14:10] showed us the way the truth and the
[1:14:15] life But as time goes
[1:14:18] on I feel like as Believers we're
[1:14:22] getting away from the way amen we're
[1:14:26] getting away from the truth and
[1:14:29] therefore it's causing us to get away
[1:14:32] from the
[1:14:34] life we're getting away from the the the
[1:14:37] the the principle things that this
[1:14:39] messenger taught us we're getting away
[1:14:42] from Holiness in our dress we're getting
[1:14:45] away from Holiness in our lives we're
[1:14:48] getting away from uh uh staying out of
[1:14:51] questionable
[1:14:53] situations and the further out of the
[1:14:55] way we get the further away from the
[1:14:59] life we get we have to ask ourselves do
[1:15:03] we believe in the message of brother
[1:15:05] Bram or do we believe in brother Google
[1:15:09] do we believe in the message of this
[1:15:11] hour or do we believe in what the
[1:15:13] government is going to tell us do we
[1:15:15] believe in the message of this hour or
[1:15:17] are we going to try to live our lives
[1:15:19] according to how we feel we should serve
[1:15:22] the Lord I want to serve the Lord Lord
[1:15:25] according to this message because it is
[1:15:28] God the mystery of God
[1:15:34] revealed I think we've gotten too caught
[1:15:36] up with as just a man and we've listened
[1:15:40] to too many other voices of people that
[1:15:43] that say this that and the other and
[1:15:45] it's causing us to stray to stray out of
[1:15:49] the way am I've been thinking a lot
[1:15:52] lately on the last vision of the Bride
[1:15:55] and how brother brandham looked and and
[1:15:57] and he saw the first one come by and he
[1:15:59] says oh my goodness that's the church
[1:16:01] she was absolutely filthy rotten to look
[1:16:05] at why because she was following the
[1:16:09] Lord after her own ways after her own
[1:16:14] dogmas after her own concepts of God and
[1:16:19] therefore in the eyes of God she's
[1:16:21] wretched miserable naked and don't don't
[1:16:25] even know
[1:16:26] it right and so all of a sudden the
[1:16:29] bride came by and my he said there she
[1:16:32] is she's she she's got that long hair
[1:16:35] and she's clean and pretty and and all
[1:16:37] of the above but as he was looking at
[1:16:40] the Bride As she continued to walk on
[1:16:43] she began to get out of Step she began
[1:16:47] to get out of line she began to get out
[1:16:50] of the street and narrow way it doesn't
[1:16:54] mean that that that she was going to
[1:16:55] fall off that way but his last cry in
[1:16:59] that Vision was get back in line get
[1:17:02] back in step and that's where we are
[1:17:05] right now I believe that too much of the
[1:17:08] time we're getting out of line we're
[1:17:10] getting out of Step we're getting out of
[1:17:12] the way and it's causing us to get out
[1:17:15] of away from the life of God God help us
[1:17:19] I want a fresh outpouring of the holy
[1:17:21] spirit in my life because without the
[1:17:24] holy Spirit you can't walk in the way
[1:17:27] without the Holy Spirit you can't walk
[1:17:29] in the Life Hallelujah Lord I don't want
[1:17:31] to walk in my own ways because my own
[1:17:34] ways will lead me astray every time take
[1:17:37] me back to the word Lord take me back to
[1:17:40] the truth
[1:17:43] father because it is the way the
[1:17:47] truth and it's the life it's God's
[1:17:51] provided
[1:17:53] way you see say why are you always
[1:17:55] harping on a prophit for because it's
[1:17:58] God's provided
[1:18:02] way why are you always quoting what
[1:18:04] brother brandham quotes because it's
[1:18:07] God's provided way it's end time
[1:18:11] evangelism at this end time it's God's
[1:18:14] provided way so if you want to know what
[1:18:17] God says if you want to know what the
[1:18:19] way is pick up a message book man pick
[1:18:23] up your Bible and give it a good
[1:18:29] read no doubt some of you before God
[1:18:33] begin to open your eyes no doubt you
[1:18:35] read the Bible and you read the stories
[1:18:38] of the Bible and you thought wow Adam
[1:18:41] and Eve wow there was a magical tree and
[1:18:45] there was there was this magical Apple
[1:18:48] this magical apricot that they took a
[1:18:51] bite of and they realized we've just
[1:18:53] partook of sin that's denominational
[1:18:57] reading no doubt you read other stories
[1:18:59] within your scripture and you just took
[1:19:02] it for face value and you said wow I
[1:19:04] don't really understand that but that's
[1:19:07] good that's okay but when you read it
[1:19:10] through a prophetic Insight when you
[1:19:13] read it through prophetic glasses
[1:19:16] through the mind of God that is revealed
[1:19:18] through a prophetic messenger you look
[1:19:21] at the same stories you look at the same
[1:19:25] uh Bible characters and you say wow I'm
[1:19:28] reading between the lines I've heard and
[1:19:30] spoken by this messenger of this last
[1:19:33] day it wasn't no apple it was a
[1:19:36] relationship now you can look at uh the
[1:19:39] story of of Abraham and Sarah and you
[1:19:42] say wow they were changed back to a
[1:19:45] young man and to a young woman again how
[1:19:48] do we know these things because it's
[1:19:51] already been spoken through prophetic
[1:19:53] insight and let me say this unless you
[1:19:56] have prophetic hearing and a prophetic
[1:19:58] heart to receive a prophetic word you'll
[1:20:01] never receive it you'll never understand
[1:20:04] it so that's why brother brandham says
[1:20:06] my Bible became a new book it's not that
[1:20:10] the words changed it's not that the
[1:20:13] stories changed but it's that the
[1:20:16] illumination of your eyes is what
[1:20:18] changed you put on a pair of glasses and
[1:20:21] you said wow I can see clearly now the I
[1:20:25] can read between the lines of this love
[1:20:29] story but without the prophetic
[1:20:32] Insight we just read it as a
[1:20:35] newspaper without the Insight of Malachi
[1:20:38] 4 without the Insight of Revelations 10
[1:20:43] 1-7 there would be no Revelations 108
[1:20:49] that's did you know that yes without the
[1:20:53] revelation of of of of Revelation 10
[1:20:57] 1-7 there would be no final voice in
[1:21:00] this final age because we would be
[1:21:03] saying what people said a couple of
[1:21:05] church ages ago we would be saying what
[1:21:08] people said under the man anointing we
[1:21:11] wouldn't be seeing what the eagle has
[1:21:13] declared in this last days so that's why
[1:21:17] we have a voice because there's a voice
[1:21:19] that already went before us and we're
[1:21:22] saying the same thing that that voice
[1:21:24] has already already
[1:21:26] spoken that's why brother Brenham said
[1:21:29] it's important to say only what I say on
[1:21:33] the tapes because the bride and the
[1:21:36] spirit say come we're saying the same
[1:21:39] thing that's already been
[1:21:42] spoken so if some of you were like I
[1:21:46] just wish there would be there would be
[1:21:48] ah some kind of great Revelation that
[1:21:50] would come forth that would help me
[1:21:51] overcome in life you're not going to get
[1:21:54] it
[1:21:55] it's already been spoken you just need a
[1:21:57] revelation of what's already been said
[1:22:00] and when God gives that Revelation
[1:22:03] that's where the power comes to overcome
[1:22:05] and
[1:22:09] laiaa this is a powerful quote brother
[1:22:12] brandham said this he said down through
[1:22:14] the last 2,000 years the Holy Ghost has
[1:22:18] been bound by denominational Creeds and
[1:22:20] doctrines but it has been loosed in
[1:22:23] these last days by the the last prophet
[1:22:26] messenger's
[1:22:31] message the trumpets of God that's where
[1:22:33] the quote is I think it's paragraph
[1:22:37] 241 or six somewhere in there go listen
[1:22:41] to it it's powerful
[1:22:44] yes but we're getting further away from
[1:22:47] it amen we're it's almost like we're
[1:22:49] embarrassed to say that we're message
[1:22:52] Believers that we believe that God sent
[1:22:54] a prophet that we believe his message
[1:22:56] that we believe it sent to turn our
[1:22:58] hearts back to the Faith of Our
[1:22:59] Pentecostal fathers am let me say this
[1:23:03] Mormons are not scared to share what
[1:23:04] they believe
[1:23:06] in don't be scared to share what you
[1:23:11] believe exactly my daughter Mariah the
[1:23:15] other day at school and uh and the
[1:23:19] teacher said uh the teacher said I'm so
[1:23:22] sad because I don't believ there there's
[1:23:25] not going to be any animals in
[1:23:27] heaven and so you know it's kind of hard
[1:23:30] for her to keep her hand down sometimes
[1:23:34] you know when you know the answer you
[1:23:35] want to I know I know I know I know and
[1:23:39] so she waited till the class was left
[1:23:42] and she went up to the teacher and she
[1:23:43] said teacher I have the answer for your
[1:23:47] for your thing you're wrong there will
[1:23:49] be animals in heaven and so the teacher
[1:23:52] gives her an audience as they do very
[1:23:54] nicely she said well tell me why you
[1:23:56] believe that and so Mariah she she
[1:23:59] started telling her well I believe that
[1:24:01] God sent a prophet messenger and he was
[1:24:03] the seventh Church age messenger and she
[1:24:05] started saying all these things and and
[1:24:08] he had a vision and he saw that his
[1:24:10] horse and his dog was in heaven and
[1:24:12] that's why we believe that there will be
[1:24:14] animals in heaven and she said thank you
[1:24:17] for sharing that I'll look into
[1:24:22] it yeah praise the Lord
[1:24:26] you just never know she might look into
[1:24:28] it and find something that she likes she
[1:24:31] might look into it and be a
[1:24:33] predestinated seed and say I believe
[1:24:35] that that's the truth tell me more
[1:24:38] elaser tell me more I want to know more
[1:24:41] of this Isaac that you've been telling
[1:24:43] me
[1:24:47] about so non he's mad he's wroth he's
[1:24:53] angry
[1:24:54] he's like he's telling me to wash in
[1:24:56] this dirty
[1:24:58] River ain't washing in no River here
[1:25:02] gets on his high horse and goes to leave
[1:25:04] and his servant hey his servants had a a
[1:25:07] little bit of wisdom behind
[1:25:09] them let me show you wisdom wisdom is
[1:25:13] not always calling something out at
[1:25:15] every opportunity you get but wisdom is
[1:25:18] this it's waiting for the right time and
[1:25:21] when you wait for the right time don't
[1:25:23] be scared to to call something out but
[1:25:25] if you just call something out all the
[1:25:27] time it's never going to be received all
[1:25:29] of the time so there's a right time and
[1:25:32] there's a right way and when the time is
[1:25:34] right don't shy away from
[1:25:38] it and so is his his servant had wisdom
[1:25:42] and he said hey uh uh you know if he had
[1:25:46] have told you to go do something really
[1:25:48] difficult if he had have told you to go
[1:25:49] slay some Giants and go uh go fast for
[1:25:53] 40 days or go do something that that's
[1:25:55] really all about your works you see it's
[1:25:58] not about our works and how much we can
[1:26:01] do and and how much we can work
[1:26:02] something up but it's relying on the way
[1:26:06] that's presented before us and the grace
[1:26:08] of
[1:26:11] God ah if he' have told you something
[1:26:14] difficult man you would have loved it
[1:26:17] you know why because it was his own
[1:26:21] Pride I did this did you see what I did
[1:26:27] you ever heard somebody talk like that
[1:26:29] did you see what I did for this person
[1:26:32] did you see what I did while serving the
[1:26:34] lord we ought to get away from I and say
[1:26:38] did you see what God did did you see
[1:26:41] what God did in that person's life
[1:26:43] that's the problem sometimes whenever uh
[1:26:46] you know you pray for somebody and they
[1:26:48] get well it's like
[1:26:50] wow I really got some Faith don't I I'm
[1:26:53] a Minister I anointed that person with
[1:26:55] oil and look what I did it ain't got
[1:26:57] nothing to do with you buddy it ain't
[1:27:00] got nothing to do with us it's by grace
[1:27:03] in Jesus Christ not by works that I have
[1:27:06] done or righteousness of my
[1:27:11] own God keep us
[1:27:16] humble pride is one of those things that
[1:27:20] we all deal with one way or another and
[1:27:23] I say father father help me with my
[1:27:26] pride amen I've said it before and I'll
[1:27:29] say it again I remember one time there
[1:27:31] was a brother said to me what do you
[1:27:33] think of that person's vehicle nice
[1:27:36] vehicle very nice it was very nice I
[1:27:39] said yeah it's very nice where I come
[1:27:41] from there's no way that we would have a
[1:27:44] vehicle like that so
[1:27:47] humble but yet it was his pride and his
[1:27:51] humility that he was missing he was so
[1:27:54] humble and he was being prideful with
[1:27:56] how humble he was but yet he was being
[1:28:01] prideful it's very interesting so
[1:28:04] whether we're humble or whether whether
[1:28:06] we short or whether we not all of us at
[1:28:09] one way or another deal with
[1:28:13] pride don't be so prideful that you
[1:28:16] can't ask for help
[1:28:19] amen because there's always someone that
[1:28:21] has the ability to help you amen amen
[1:28:26] so here he was and he begins to well I
[1:28:30] guess that's good counsel and he begins
[1:28:33] to take off his clothing and and no
[1:28:36] doubt his servants had never seen the
[1:28:40] sin in his life
[1:28:41] before they had never seen that part of
[1:28:44] leprosy on his body they had always seen
[1:28:46] him as this big strong and a warrior
[1:28:50] vant honorable but yet when he began to
[1:28:54] humble himself before the people around
[1:28:56] him and everybody began to
[1:28:59] look I had no
[1:29:02] idea I didn't know that he had that in
[1:29:06] his
[1:29:08] life but notice the Bible doesn't show
[1:29:11] us that they called him out and they
[1:29:13] said you secret Sinner and so on and so
[1:29:16] forth no they let him
[1:29:19] watch down one time and up he went down
[1:29:24] another time and he went up and no doubt
[1:29:27] the water was stinky and no doubt the
[1:29:30] water was muddy and it was filthy
[1:29:33] because the rivers of Jordan is a dirty
[1:29:36] River you know sometimes life can be
[1:29:40] muddy sometimes life can be
[1:29:43] dirty but as long as we're following in
[1:29:46] the ways of the Lord it'll all work out
[1:29:51] okay if he would have stopped at number
[1:29:54] five he would have never been healed if
[1:29:56] he would have stopped at number six he
[1:29:58] would have never been healed but when he
[1:30:00] went down the seventh time when he came
[1:30:02] up the Bible tells us that his skin was
[1:30:06] that of a
[1:30:07] child it wasn't because of his own
[1:30:11] Mighty works that he did but it's
[1:30:13] because he followed the footsteps and
[1:30:16] the words of the Lord for the day and
[1:30:19] the hour in which he was living in
[1:30:22] understand without f in the footsteps of
[1:30:25] this message that we believe there is no
[1:30:29] way back to
[1:30:34] Calvary you say there's no way to
[1:30:36] Calvary without the light of the day no
[1:30:39] it's a Calvary of another
[1:30:42] time it's a denominational
[1:30:46] Calvary it's a Jesus of the past not of
[1:30:49] the
[1:30:50] present it's a crucifying of the past
[1:30:53] not a crucifying of now he doesn't want
[1:30:57] us just to crucify of the past but he
[1:30:59] wants us to crucify ourselves on a daily
[1:31:06] basis brother brandham said this he said
[1:31:10] that only the elect can be
[1:31:17] reborn so what you're trying to tell me
[1:31:20] is others that are outside
[1:31:24] the Realms of of the elect how we would
[1:31:28] talk it you're trying to tell me that
[1:31:29] they cannot be born again absolutely
[1:31:34] facts they can be
[1:31:37] forgiven and they can have a
[1:31:39] relationship of a god of the past but to
[1:31:43] have a relationship with the god of
[1:31:45] now right now and his ways which are now
[1:31:50] there's no way outside of the light of
[1:31:53] your day amen amen amen so what do we do
[1:31:57] with it do we hide it under a
[1:32:01] bushel
[1:32:03] no I'm going to let it
[1:32:05] shine why is it important for us to let
[1:32:08] our light shines and not hide it under a
[1:32:10] bushel because we want people to get to
[1:32:18] Calvary so we find it
[1:32:22] nonon before non could be uh healed of
[1:32:26] this
[1:32:27] disease that before non could get rid of
[1:32:31] this sin in his life he had to do one
[1:32:33] thing first he had to Humble
[1:32:37] himself he had to Humble himself before
[1:32:39] his
[1:32:41] servants he had to Humble himself before
[1:32:44] Elisha he had to Humble himself before
[1:32:46] everybody that was out on the banks and
[1:32:48] was watching and realized that when he
[1:32:52] took these garments off that it would be
[1:32:55] there for all to
[1:32:58] see but whenever you mean business with
[1:33:01] God you don't care who's
[1:33:05] watching brother brandham tells this
[1:33:07] story about this woman one time and he
[1:33:10] and and he said uh uh she had an issue
[1:33:12] with smoking and she went to the
[1:33:14] brandham Tabernacle and he was telling
[1:33:17] the story I have prayed with her
[1:33:19] multiple times and I have she has come
[1:33:22] to the altar mult multiple times and she
[1:33:24] has prayed and prayed and and she has
[1:33:27] cried and she has gotten emotional and
[1:33:29] she has done all these things but she
[1:33:31] could just never get over this demon of
[1:33:36] cigarettes and so brother brandham took
[1:33:39] her aside one time and he said okay
[1:33:41] sister let's
[1:33:44] pray and we find out that she was
[1:33:48] praying and she was she was she actually
[1:33:50] got sick and she was dying they said she
[1:33:52] had cancer isn't it amazing that it can
[1:33:55] say on a cigarette package causes
[1:33:59] cancer but yet millions of people will
[1:34:03] still
[1:34:04] stand and smoke a
[1:34:07] cigarette I'll take my
[1:34:10] chances isn't it amazing that we can see
[1:34:14] a lot of the the processed junk in this
[1:34:17] food that we partake of and we know what
[1:34:20] it
[1:34:21] causes but yet we're so addicted to it
[1:34:25] that we can't get away from it I say God
[1:34:28] help us because our bodies is what it's
[1:34:32] a temple and it is a temple of the Holy
[1:34:35] Ghost when we become Believers we don't
[1:34:38] go out and we don't get tattoos we don't
[1:34:40] go out and Pierce our ears and put a a
[1:34:42] nose ring in our ear no in our nose no
[1:34:45] because we believe that our body is a
[1:34:47] temple of the Holy Ghost let's narrow it
[1:34:50] down just a little bit more and take
[1:34:52] inventory of the processed junk that is
[1:34:56] absolutely killing our human
[1:34:58] bodies and say F and say you know what
[1:35:01] this is absolutely terrible for me I'm
[1:35:04] going to
[1:35:06] pass nobody said amen look at that you
[1:35:10] bunch of
[1:35:11] processed eating ice cream lovers
[1:35:15] cocacola
[1:35:20] drinkers all the lovealls are like I
[1:35:22] can't give up my ice cream
[1:35:24] [Laughter]
[1:35:27] rocky road all day
[1:35:30] long but we need to take a little bit of
[1:35:33] inventory I've been trying that's why I
[1:35:35] can preach
[1:35:37] it been trying for a little bit and it's
[1:35:40] good it's good for you drink a little
[1:35:43] more water instead of a soda it makes
[1:35:45] you feel good drink a little more water
[1:35:47] instead of a Red Bull or a monster guys
[1:35:49] you won't crash at
[1:35:51] 2:00 guys are all laugh because you know
[1:35:54] it's true do a Donald Trump here you
[1:36:01] see where was
[1:36:04] I eating ice cream you may be
[1:36:09] dismissed and ice cream's on brother
[1:36:12] Ezra
[1:36:23] I'm
[1:36:24] [Laughter]
[1:36:27] sorry that's one of those things where
[1:36:29] it's like a personal thing huh you can
[1:36:31] either take it or leave it but there's a
[1:36:33] little spiritual aspect to it there
[1:36:37] absolutely so now we see that that uh
[1:36:41] that non was not eating ice
[1:36:44] cream but he humbled himself that's
[1:36:46] where he was thank you Lord he humbled
[1:36:50] himself before the
[1:36:51] people and he realized ized I'm going to
[1:36:55] Bear
[1:36:56] all before these many people and my
[1:36:59] servants and Elijah and Gesa and
[1:37:01] everybody that's watching I'm going to
[1:37:03] Bear all and I'm going to go and I'm
[1:37:05] going to dip because I want to get well
[1:37:08] that's where I was going brother so
[1:37:09] brother brandom the woman with the woman
[1:37:11] that was smoking and had
[1:37:14] cancer she was on her
[1:37:16] deathbed and so she's she's getting all
[1:37:19] shriveled up or whatever and she's
[1:37:21] losing weight and so on and so forth
[1:37:24] and brother brandom said well let me
[1:37:25] pray for you let's pray together and he
[1:37:28] had her pray and so she prayed and she
[1:37:31] prayed and and she said she was done and
[1:37:34] she cried and she got emotional and she
[1:37:36] got up and she said she was done brother
[1:37:38] Bram said no you're not
[1:37:40] done you didn't break through to where
[1:37:43] you should have brother bradam sat down
[1:37:46] with her and then he prayed and she
[1:37:48] prayed and she prayed until she broke
[1:37:51] through the barrier she broke through
[1:37:53] that spirit that has been holding her
[1:37:56] this whole time and she had prayed and
[1:37:58] she had cried before and she had boohoo
[1:38:01] and she had gotten emotional but
[1:38:03] whenever she had gotten sick onto death
[1:38:06] her prayer meant business some of you
[1:38:09] might say I've been bound up by spirits
[1:38:13] of loua I'm bound up with drink I'm
[1:38:16] bound up with smoke I'm bound up with
[1:38:18] with with the complexes that this that
[1:38:21] this world uh gives us on a daily basis
[1:38:24] and I've tried and I've prayed and I've
[1:38:26] tried to overcome and I can't overcome I
[1:38:29] have prayed and I have fasted and I have
[1:38:31] done this and I've done that my brother
[1:38:34] and my sister we need to get down to
[1:38:36] business it's not just until you cry
[1:38:40] though that's a part of repentance but
[1:38:42] it's until you break through that thing
[1:38:45] that has you
[1:38:47] bound then you'll be changed from that
[1:38:49] time forth I say father give some of us
[1:38:53] a break breakthrough give us a time of
[1:38:56] prayer where we're not worried about
[1:38:58] what's going on let us be like brother
[1:39:00] Mike Patterson that when our family sees
[1:39:02] the light is on in our prayer closet
[1:39:04] that they know not to bother us I
[1:39:07] thought that was
[1:39:09] amazing a lot of you weren't there so
[1:39:12] I'll share
[1:39:13] it brother Mike brother Robert and I
[1:39:16] were talking about it in the back we
[1:39:18] didn't know this about brother Mike that
[1:39:20] brother Mike was a real prayer Warrior
[1:39:25] you know it's interesting when you see a
[1:39:27] man I only knew brother Mike the the
[1:39:28] last 2 and a half
[1:39:30] years and you see a man and you see his
[1:39:33] decline in health and you see his uh
[1:39:37] perhaps uh mental Clarity
[1:39:41] decline but yet he still loved the
[1:39:43] Lord and and and when we look at that we
[1:39:46] think okay we'll have Grace on brother
[1:39:50] Mike but when he was in his prime when
[1:39:52] he was in his Heyday he was a prayer
[1:39:54] Warrior he was a warrior for the Gospel
[1:39:57] of Jesus Christ and every time and and I
[1:40:00] can just give a rose here to brother
[1:40:02] Mike whenever he would whenever after I
[1:40:06] was done preaching and we would talk he
[1:40:07] would always try to encourage you his
[1:40:10] conversation would always try to be
[1:40:12] about the Lord Jesus
[1:40:14] Christ even when his mental capacities
[1:40:17] was failing him his heart still loved
[1:40:20] the
[1:40:21] Lord and so brother Mike had a had a
[1:40:24] place where he would go in the woods and
[1:40:25] he would go and he would pray he had a
[1:40:28] place at home his little office and his
[1:40:30] daughter gave the the testimony that
[1:40:32] whenever whenever Daddy's light was on
[1:40:34] in the office you knew to be quiet and
[1:40:37] you knew not to bother him because he
[1:40:39] was praying to the Lord we need some of
[1:40:42] that in our lives I need some of that in
[1:40:44] my life we all need some of it in our
[1:40:47] lives we need to stop getting so caught
[1:40:50] up with the cares of this world with the
[1:40:53] cares that choke out the seed that
[1:40:56] dwells within us and set some time aside
[1:40:59] to pray and seek the
[1:41:04] Lord all of
[1:41:07] us cuz if I was that it would be easier
[1:41:10] for me to ask who's not busy than ask
[1:41:12] who's
[1:41:14] busy because we're all busy but we need
[1:41:18] to be disciplined with our time God help
[1:41:21] us
[1:41:23] and
[1:41:25] so let me I have a quote here let me see
[1:41:30] uh influence
[1:41:33] 1963 and brother bram's talking about
[1:41:35] Uzziah he says God smote him with
[1:41:37] Leprosy the man died in his leprosy
[1:41:39] which is a type of sin he couldn't stand
[1:41:42] to be corrected by the word so Uzziah
[1:41:46] could not humble himself and bring
[1:41:48] himself under the authority of the word
[1:41:51] that said hey you're out of your please
[1:41:53] don't do that but he was just so
[1:41:55] prideful that he couldn't come
[1:41:58] subjective under the his
[1:42:01] Pastor he couldn't come subjective and
[1:42:04] he said ah I'm going to do what I want
[1:42:06] God smoted him with Leprosy brother
[1:42:08] Brandon said here it's a type of sin he
[1:42:10] couldn't stand to be corrected paragraph
[1:42:13] 88 in the same service what happened to
[1:42:16] this King a great man a Believer a God
[1:42:18] blessed man he was smitten with Leprosy
[1:42:21] which is a type of sin unbelief no cure
[1:42:24] for it only Christ and he died in that
[1:42:29] same
[1:42:30] shape so we see that there's no uh there
[1:42:34] is no cure for leprosy which is a type
[1:42:37] of sin there's no cure for sin in this
[1:42:40] day only through Jesus
[1:42:43] Christ and so how do I come to Jesus
[1:42:46] Christ I come with a broken and contrite
[1:42:48] spirit I come with a repenting and
[1:42:51] humble heart and I say father I'm wrong
[1:42:55] I've done wrong I've thought wrong I've
[1:42:57] said wrong I'm going to apologize to you
[1:42:59] I'm going to apologize to my family
[1:43:02] because I want the cure for sin in my
[1:43:05] life where there's no repentance there's
[1:43:08] no recovery and there's no forgiveness
[1:43:12] of
[1:43:14] sin
[1:43:16] Hallelujah say you're only talking to
[1:43:18] the brother Stephen
[1:43:20] mm no you remember the time sister
[1:43:23] sister ma she was all she got all uh uh
[1:43:27] man she was all stressed out and she
[1:43:30] told Brother brandom to correct uh
[1:43:32] Joseph you remember the story she
[1:43:34] slammed the door brother brandham said
[1:43:37] he didn't like that you remember what
[1:43:40] caused the sickness that came from that
[1:43:42] she had a tumor why because she failed
[1:43:46] to respect her
[1:43:47] husband she
[1:43:50] overreacted because she got emotional
[1:43:52] which is a woman thing to do
[1:43:54] huh guys do the same thing I guess too
[1:43:57] but we overreact in different ways but
[1:44:00] because she failed to respect her
[1:44:03] husband and the gift that was
[1:44:04] surrounding her God caused this tumor to
[1:44:08] come in her life I wonder sometimes are
[1:44:11] we sick and body as Believers because we
[1:44:14] fail to respect one
[1:44:16] another
[1:44:21] amen so he did seven times and he came
[1:44:25] up and his sin his flesh was back to
[1:44:28] what it was as he was a child when I
[1:44:32] when we all think of seven in the
[1:44:33] scripture we think wow seven Church age
[1:44:36] Messengers seven Church ages and we
[1:44:38] begin to tie this all back together and
[1:44:41] I wondered what is what what is it
[1:44:44] trying to show us within the scripture
[1:44:46] here of Why seven times and why after
[1:44:49] the seventh time was he made clean back
[1:44:51] to what he was before
[1:44:53] because this first church age bride and
[1:44:57] the last Church age bride is going to be
[1:44:59] the same she was pure and spotless at
[1:45:02] the beginning and at the end she is also
[1:45:05] going to be pure and
[1:45:07] spotless it is no
[1:45:10] coincidence that brother brandham at the
[1:45:13] time of brother branham's life that they
[1:45:15] would come up with this chemical called
[1:45:19] bleach and we all think of bleach and
[1:45:22] everybody knows about bleach but listen
[1:45:24] to what brother bradam says here about
[1:45:26] bleach God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:45:29] well let's look at that little ink and
[1:45:30] see where it come from now it's ink it's
[1:45:32] been put together and chemicals and so
[1:45:35] forth till it's become ink and it's
[1:45:37] black you drop it on your clothes it'll
[1:45:39] stain but we manufactured the stuff
[1:45:41] called bleach you women use Clorox
[1:45:43] bleach well I take that one drop of ink
[1:45:45] and drop it onto the tub of bleach now
[1:45:47] what happened to the ink see bleach has
[1:45:49] been manufactured invented and
[1:45:51] manufactured chemicals together that
[1:45:53] will break up that coloring so bad till
[1:45:55] you can't find it no part of the bleach
[1:45:58] is water water is H2O which is hydrogen
[1:46:01] and oxide and oxygen and both hydrogen
[1:46:05] and oxygen both are dangerous explosives
[1:46:08] and hydrogen and oxygen is actually
[1:46:11] ashes that's what it is that's right
[1:46:12] chemical ashes now put it together and
[1:46:16] you got water but break it up you got
[1:46:18] hydrogen and oxygen and just keep on
[1:46:21] going back now in getting in this now
[1:46:24] there might be C sitting here he says
[1:46:26] there will be cus listen at this I don't
[1:46:28] know the formula but I just want to
[1:46:30] explain it in my own humble way trusting
[1:46:32] that God will reveal himself in it look
[1:46:36] I drop that drop of ink into bleach what
[1:46:38] happens immediately the black stain is
[1:46:40] gone you couldn't find it again if you
[1:46:42] had to it's gone you'll never see it no
[1:46:44] more what's happened now you don't see
[1:46:46] nothing come up from it that he's saying
[1:46:49] there's no little trail of anything
[1:46:51] there's there's nothing it's gone has
[1:46:53] disappeared this black ink that was once
[1:46:56] there is no longer there because of this
[1:46:58] Clorox
[1:46:59] bleach he says you don't why don't you
[1:47:02] because it's broke up he says now
[1:47:04] science would say it turned back to its
[1:47:06] original acids what did acids come from
[1:47:09] I think brother Brandon was a
[1:47:11] chemist he says for instance fumes made
[1:47:14] acids where did fumes come from it it
[1:47:16] was all fumes made by molecules where
[1:47:18] did molecules come from from atoms where
[1:47:21] did atoms come from from electrons where
[1:47:23] did they come from cosmic light see
[1:47:25] you're back you're Plumb back a past
[1:47:28] finding of cists now and if it is a
[1:47:31] substance and a creation it has to come
[1:47:34] from a
[1:47:37] Creator and so here he was he dips seven
[1:47:41] times he comes up and his flesh his sin
[1:47:44] is completely annihilated it's not there
[1:47:47] anymore it was once there for everybody
[1:47:50] to see but now it'll be forgotten about
[1:47:53] why because he followed the paths of the
[1:47:56] messenger of that
[1:47:59] age so let me ask you about your
[1:48:02] sin we've all came short of the glory of
[1:48:05] God we've all did things wrong we've all
[1:48:09] said things wrong we've all told lies
[1:48:12] we've done many things that perhaps
[1:48:15] we're as the musicians come what that
[1:48:17] were that we would be
[1:48:19] embarrassed for everybody to see here
[1:48:21] this morning
[1:48:24] but the blood of Jesus
[1:48:26] Christ is stronger than any Clorox
[1:48:29] bleach that they can
[1:48:32] manufacture that's why this age of
[1:48:36] laa it is an age of the revelation of
[1:48:41] justification if he would have dipped
[1:48:43] six times his sin still would have been
[1:48:46] there if he would have dipped five times
[1:48:49] representing the fifth Church age his
[1:48:51] sins would have been still there fourth
[1:48:53] third second
[1:48:55] first but because it came to this
[1:48:58] seventh Church age this loudan church
[1:49:02] age that we're now living in with a true
[1:49:05] revelation of true justification in the
[1:49:09] lives of the Believers there was no
[1:49:11] Trace that was found in his
[1:49:13] life there's no ink that can be found
[1:49:18] there's no little Trail there's no
[1:49:20] little speck he dropped that ink in a
[1:49:23] thing of bleach it's not there anymore
[1:49:25] where does it go to it goes back and it
[1:49:28] goes back and it goes back and it goes
[1:49:31] back and it goes back and it goes back
[1:49:34] until it can go back no further until it
[1:49:38] goes back to the very Mind Of
[1:49:41] God but when your sins are plunged
[1:49:44] beneath the blood of Jesus Christ with
[1:49:48] true justification in our lives it is a
[1:49:52] r
[1:49:53] from the very Mind Of God
[1:49:55] himself so take it back as far as you
[1:49:58] want
[1:50:00] to go back as far as you want to in your
[1:50:03] family life in your family history that
[1:50:06] has family complexes that has family
[1:50:10] shortcomings take it back as far as you
[1:50:13] want it's done with
[1:50:16] amen the sin question has been answered
[1:50:23] Jesus Christ God's own
[1:50:26] son by the shedding of his blood has
[1:50:29] forgiven us of all sins and all
[1:50:41] iniquities you say well what about my
[1:50:45] shortcomings what about
[1:50:47] them have you been born
[1:50:50] again say Stephen
[1:50:54] what about this and what about that and
[1:50:57] what about the other my question to you
[1:51:00] back to you is have you been born again
[1:51:02] and if you have been born again by the
[1:51:04] spirit of God and you've been plunged
[1:51:07] beneath the Clorox bleach of the
[1:51:10] blood let it
[1:51:12] alone leave it in the
[1:51:14] past stop going fishing stop looking for
[1:51:19] something and when things come back to
[1:51:21] your memory
[1:51:23] instead of dwelling upon the memory say
[1:51:26] father thank you for what you've brought
[1:51:29] me
[1:51:30] from thank you from what to what you
[1:51:33] brought me through that is part of the
[1:51:36] past of Steven mcney that is the part of
[1:51:39] the past of where I came from yes that
[1:51:41] is a part of who I who I was but now I'm
[1:51:44] someone different I have the mind of
[1:51:47] Christ I've been born again by the
[1:51:48] spirit of God my desires aren't the same
[1:51:51] anymore therefore I'm going to walk in
[1:51:54] Freedom and I'm going to walk in Liberty
[1:51:56] when I have the memories come back to me
[1:51:58] I'm going to say this thank you Jesus
[1:52:01] thank you God for what you've done in my
[1:52:03] life thank you for forgiving me thank
[1:52:06] you for setting me
[1:52:08] free Hallelujah don't dwell don't let
[1:52:12] Satan dwell in your mind upon past
[1:52:17] mistakes don't let your past mistakes
[1:52:22] ah what am I trying to say don't let it
[1:52:26] control your
[1:52:28] future don't let it control who you are
[1:52:31] now
[1:52:34] amen and I'll say this and then I'll
[1:52:38] close to those of
[1:52:40] you that have never been born
[1:52:43] again that have never had an experience
[1:52:46] with God that have never come under the
[1:52:48] blood of Jesus Christ Now's the
[1:52:51] Time what doth
