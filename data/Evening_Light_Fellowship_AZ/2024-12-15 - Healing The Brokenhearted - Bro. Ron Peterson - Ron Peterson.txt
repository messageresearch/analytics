good I appreciate it yeah yeah give him a hand yeah uh also too I'd like to have questions and answers here in the uh next couple weeks I am leaving next Sunday a week from today Sandy and I are leaving to go to Germany we leave on the 22nd I have two Services uh Christmas Day in Germany with brother Garrett Ral one the next day on the the 26th the 27th we rest the 28th we come home so it's just a real quick trip over to Germany and back uh Service Christmas day Wednesday is cancelled here at the church so uh just so that you know it but questions and answers questions and answers if you have them you can write them down and give them to uh either a deacon or a trustee or you can send it to the church website or or you can send it to my personal email and uh uh there's just some things that uh different ones have asked and I thought well this is a good time to go ahead and go into questions and answers we haven't done that in quite a long time so if you would do that I appreciate it also Sunday January the 12th Sunday morning uh brother Ed hammermeister from up there in Canada is going to be with us so we'll be looking forward to that turn with me if you would to your in your Bibles to the book of Isaiah the book of Isaiah chapter 61 Isaiah 61 verse 1 Jesus having taken this scroll the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives yes and the opening of prison to them that are bound my you could preach a month just on a couple of those words right there want you to take notice of what he said he's going to preach the gospel and he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to bind up the Brokenhearted Luke chap 4 and verse 17-8 this is now the New Testament version of Christ taking that book there was delivered unto him the book of The Prophet isaas or Isaiah and when he had opened the book you know he loves to open books he loves to Open Eyes thank and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives the recovering of sight to the Blind and set at Liberty them that are bruised notice he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted turn with me to one more scripture Book of Psalms Psalms 69 verses 20 and 21 reproach hath broken my heart and I am full of heaviness and I looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but I found none they gave me also Gul for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink here is David having the anointing of God upon him and he is portraying the very enactment of Christ himself there at Calvary and he says reproach hath broken my heart father God now as we have read your word I pray let the anointing of God Almighty come down upon each and every one of us father give us great Revelation that only comes by way of your Holy Spirit father we thank you we praise you we ask these things for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord hallelujah I would like to take a title this morning healing the Brokenhearted and I want to take a subject which is a very vast subject the issues of the heart and there's so much that I could say this morning about the heart the Bible is full of scriptures about the heart in fact we started singing prepare our hearts then we saying create in me a clean heart God help us to watch over our hearts not only our hearts but the hearts of others God help us to measure our words and the words that we say let them be yay and nay and so it's important to look at this this morning and I thought I just share with you a couple things before I go into the depth of my sermon but the Bible speaks about the conditions of the heart in many ways it talks about how not to harden your heart that you're to have a clean heart you're to have a pure heart you're to have a circumcised heart and you're to have a forgiving heart because the attributes of the heart when you begin to look at it and as I was studying I found out that fear love courage anger Joy sorrow hatred are all ascribed to the heart in the Old Testament they are attributes they are issues of the heart but today I wish to focus on one thing one part of that heart and that is the broken heart Webster says a brokenhearted person is a person overcome by grief or Despair and I asked the question can you die of a broken heart yes you can it is a very rare occasion in fact the doctors say that it's about 1% of all of those that have what is called a broken heart some people become so grieved so broken in spirit so emotionally stressed that they can't crawl out of it and they die of a broken heart when you experience emotional or traumatic events in your life your nervous system triggers stress hormones like adrenaline and epinephrine some of these words I don't know you got to be a pharmacist or a doctor we know that that's normal but rarely and for some reason we can't fully understand that sometimes a person will be under such a load such a stress that they can experience a heart like attack or a heart attack symptom it's actually got a doctor's name for it broken heart syndrome a more formally called stress cardiomyopathy another word is Taco Tu subo must be a Japanese guy who discovered at cardiomyopathy and it can be in an emergency situation that requires prompt medical attention emotional stress response as a heartbreak triggers intense emotional stress activating the body's stress response system this involves the release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline which can lead to physical symptoms in the body which doctors call psychosomatic pain the brain can manifest emotional pain as physical Sensations such as they might call it a ghost pain nothing wrong with the foot and yet the foot feels pain and uh then I looked at what about healing a broken heart what does it take it says it takes time it takes self-care and patience you have to start allowing yourself to feel your emotions without judgment it's truly okay to grieve it is okay to cry it is okay to release some of these emotions but then there comes a time where you wash your face you take a deep breath and say okay let's go on otherwise you will dig the hole so deep the wall will become so high the moment will be become so dark that you cannot see a way out and some people live even as mbth did in a place called loar loab bar is a place of no communication right in a place of isolation that's what they do to prisoners when when they really want to control them if the guy's acting up put him in isolation for about 3 months no contact No Light No nothing just give him the food through a slot the door and that's it the Bible speaks many times about broken arts and its effect upon the person and I just want to show you a few quotes and like I said this is a vast subject the heart and there's so many avenues that we could take whether of a condemning heart a callous heart or whatever but I wish to focus on one thing this morning A Broken Heart the Bible says in Psalms 341 18-19 the Lord is n unto them that are of a broken heart and save as such of be a contrite SP Spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord [Music] deliverthat together the outcasts of Israel he Health the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds he tth the number of the stars and calleth them all by their names think of that Abraham thy seed shall be like the Sand by the seash shore or look up into the heavens and they shall be like the stars in the heavens you realize that every part of that heavenly Celestial hemisphere has to do with God and his Bible because that's God's first Bible no wonder he would number the stars and name them isn't it amazing have you ever laid back on the grass out in the field away from the city and looked up at the stars and for some straight reason you have an offend towards a certain star maybe that's your star there's something about the attraction of the heavens amen now the prophet speaks about a broken heart and let me read to you a quote here of what he said because again this is a very vast subject but I want to just go in here I'm going to read just the highlighted portion of this quote in the mighty conqueror 1956 the Bible said that his blood and water separated from each other and any doctor or any thing can tell you that knows that chemistry of the blood that only sorrow will do that he never died from a Roman spear neither did he die from a nail droven his hands or his feet but he died of a broken heart being rejected he he came to his own and his own received him not Jesus Christ died of a broken heart anyone that's ever gone through such a traumatic thing such as having your heart broken it's traumatizing it is is almost a near-death experience because you will cry until you can cry no more you will moan and groan there will be a pain it will be as though you're dying in fact you may during this time say Lord why don't you just take me home I can't handle the pressure brother Brenham in questions and answers when Jesus suffered in that body he suffered because a man and a woman are one person Eve was taken out of Adam and the church what happened God opened up the side of Adam and took out their helpmate the bride and God opened up the side of Jesus at Calvary and took out the bride and see when Jesus died at Calvary the B the bride was taken from the body excuse me was not taken from the body until the body was dead he'd already died see so they draw back the hammer to break his leg and a man run up with a spear and pushed it through his heart and water and blood came forth now some doctors got together who are cardiologists and they took the part they said where water and blood came out because the sword or the spear pierced up through his cavity up into the heart area and the doctor said this that Jesus literally died from a broken heart with the collapse of the ruptured heart cavity resulting in a separation of the raw watery serum from the clotted blood in the pericardium it's amazing so his heart literally broke it rubs it gave way like an egg with a shell cracked something opened and came out the chastisement of our peace was upon him he was stricken of God and beaten he was forsaken smitten and bruised he was forsaken by God and man because on the cross he said Eli Eli L he suffered so much that he said my God why hast Thou forsaken me forsaken by man and by God and there was the man Christ Jesus now brother Brenham answers you cannot kill God he said so the spirit of God had to leave the man Christ Jesus when he was in The Garden of Gethsemane and he knew what was before him for this cause came I into the world but he said let this cup pass from me nevertheless thy will be done and as he prayed he prayed so earnestly and under such pressure that drops of blood came forth from his very skin on his brow can you imagine such pressure and that here he was in The Garden of Gethsemane and the garden is a wine garden and what do you do with wine you crush the grape and God is crushing the very grape of God to bring forth a life Fruit from you oh help me Lord this morning as I speak to your people now we've got quite a few here in our church that are in the medical field and you just kind of bear with me a little bit because I'm not a doctor I'm not trained in these things but let me just say some things that I have noticed physical trauma to the outside of the body you can immediately see the effects of it if somebody breaks their arm and it's hanging down here oh you have a broken arm if somebody has got a laceration on their skull oh you need stitches different thing if you've broke your leg those are manifestations to the outward body that you can see they're traumatizing and they need immediate fixing but I want to ask you what about that which is on the inside of the body that you cannot see the part of the body that how can you see depression how can you see anxiety how can you see suicide how can you see depression or anger or something that's pent up and the so many of God's people are hemorrhaging are hurting within they are going through the pace oh how are you doing I'm fine by his grace yeah don't ask him a second question because they might just burst out in tears no really how you doing so so when you look at depression anxiety loneliness they cannot be discovered by looking at the physical person it's not it's not something oh you might see a s sad countenance or you know the lower lip hanging down whatever but you can't find it with an x-ray or a CAT scan or an MRI yes there are sign that one might recognize that somebody's depressed you might see by their countenance by the way they walk you you ever watch people at the mall or at the airport I'm a people Watcher my wife's a shopper she shops she's when she's in her Zone she's in her Zone when I'm out there I'll sit I'll tell her you go in I'll sit right here and I watch all the people go by and you watch and here here comes a you know somebody like this and you can see they're they're on their way they're doing something huh they're happy right and then you see somebody else you know like e or oh is me everything is wrong why did I get up this morning you can just you know uh kind of discerned by the way they walk The Talk The countenance but many times our physical sicknesses are brought about because of heart issues because of stress that we're under comes out in a physical way oh yeah many times you may look normal on the outside but inside you're hemorrhaging you're really going through something but when the spirit discerns the problem the person is having all kinds of physical problems because now the spirit's Discerning that it's not a physical though it's manifesting in physical form but the cause is a wounded spirit is a broken heart yes many of our physical ailments we bring upon ourselves we overeat we have an improper diet we have no physical exercise you ride your ebike to your your mailbox 50 ft away you don't take time let me tell you one thing that I have learned or am learning as I get older is you have to take time to sit and relax and destress huh anybody with me there are times you know Hey listen I'm home hey there's something about just getting in the garage door put that thing in park you get out restroom I don't know about you and then a after that then you you go you look for your chair there it is it's been calling to me or maybe your bed any of you your bed calls to you yeah I I I tell you I'm driving home sometimes they say oh Sandy Sandy I'm dreaming of my bed my pillow under the sheets any of you have that sleep before the Lord syndrome where you just you got to lay before the Lord absolutely the older you get you have to recharge brother ra said there is a time you have to let off the pressure emotional stress and mental pressure cannot be recognized by just looking at a person a brokenhearted person can still go to work they can still go shopping they do their every day functions of life and yet they're they're broken and they're just going through the motions and they're breathing but they're not living does that make sense it's just like no joy no happiness no nothing I'm just existing now is there anybody here that would like to help me did any of you take drama in school or were you in a play some of you shaking your head don't ask me don't don't don't don't ask me okay anybody raise their hand you want to help me huh you okay come on Sarah you want to come up here did you raise your hand okay well come on man you're my volunteer my Victim my volunte you did raise your hand God bless you God bless you okay now you're you're going to be a person that I'm going to give you a symptom and I'm going to tell you something and then you're going to act it out and they're going to try to guess what what it is that you're going through I will try you'll try you're you're good I know you're good you don't have a shy bone in your body sis let me tell you okay let me look here turn up yeah and then you guys guess a little bit more because that wasn't enough okay frustrated yeah that's good what brings on the FR frustration I said mental pressure so she's going any of you ever do that you get to you just you're figh in the air yeah it's true okay that's an easy one what is it it's anger I think that you know you didn't even have to pretend on some of these it's like hey it was this morning man I was come you know was on our way to church and my wife you ask me something okay see these are things that are unless we recognize the symptoms of what you have then then it just goes unnoticed and you you are imploding exploding nothing explodes nicely does it when somebody explodes it's never nice what about somebody that implodes when somebody doesn't let the pressure off and it gets so great and they stop talking and they just shut up yeah and all of the pressure goes within yeah that's to implode have you ever been there have you ever had something so much that that you know you you you're just trying to keep keep it all together and you're imploding you're it's like the atmospheric pressure of these diving uh things that go under the water and if there's any type of release of pressure that thing implodes and the people inside of that bisphere are killed instantly okay here's another one yeah yeah oh you can you hug me you're not supposed to but it's okay it's okay but you want to show guess it what is she showing love yeah everybody wants to be loved don't you and you can tell There's Something About Love when it's real it touches you and when it's not real don't fake it don't try to fake me out with this I love you right let me see here okay last one easy because I have been broken many many times and I want to tell you that this message is for me you know why because this week I I went through something really really hard and it was like you say I I had anxiety I I had everything that you're talking about and I was there and I felt so lonely brother but then I cried to God and I said please Lord help me is is this sermon for you can I pray for her right now would you pray with me right now father God in the name of Jesus Christ she raised her hand not knowing but coming up here father and the Very last thing we talk about brokenhearted she had to confess father God was that you was that you calling her out was that you exposing to her and her confessing father I pray heal up the Brokenhearted Lord bind up her wounds let the let the BAL of Gilead be her portion father and give her a pieace that passes all understanding I ask it For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you Sister Sarah thank you for coming up here and that was that was of God that you did it I didn't call you I didn't tell you that no God did it go ahead and go to your seat let's give her a big hand you see many of us have been through situations where you feel like you're being crushed when you're under situations like that you can't hardly read your Bible it's hard to be around people you know I wish people loveed me as much as my dog CU my dog is always happy to see me I want you to know that doctors see patients every day that don't have outward symptoms they can't see it and so the person tells him hey Doc I want I want you to understand doctors many times do not go to the heart of the cause but they treat the symptom oh I see you have a runny nose I'll give you an anahist amine I see you have a cough I'll give you robot tesin I see that you have a fever I'll give you some aspirin I see this this and so pretty soon he's giving you and I had a doctor that listen you couldn't be in his office sit on you just barely sat down he comes in oh hi Ron uh how you doing you say well if I was doing good I wouldn't be here but um you know and then I say well I'm feeling this way he you know listens here cough do this and uh he says okay um I'm writing a prescription head is uh come and see me in two weeks if if you're not any better well thanks Doc so I go out and get all the medicine do you like do you guys all like to take a handful of pills every morning oh my goodness anyway I don't need to go there doctors practice medicine and they bury their mistakes and doctors that just give you a prescription instead of actually trying to find the cause are just doctors that are working for the big Pharmacy companies because Pharmacy's multibillion doll trillion dollar business if you have a headache take an aspirin if you're all stressed out I'm going to recommend valume or some kind of a sedative okay or some kind of uh thing that'll calm you down if you got insomnia and you can't sleep uh here's a sleeping tablet if if you're all depressed here is an anti-depressant and here is all of this stuff and your cabinet will be filled here's a pill to wake up here's a pill to perk you up here's a one to bring you down here's one to there's a pill for everything but I'll tell you about a pill that I want all of you to know that will heal everything you got and that's the gospel you find Jesus Christ and let him in into your life not that you won't have issues not that you won't go through things but let me tell you he is the Healer of all your diseases he is the comfort in in all of your stress he is the one that can calm the storm he is the one that can give you peace that will pass all understanding when all hell is breaking loose and everything is falling apart he's the one that holds your mind he's the one that binds CLE up your broken heart he's the one that keeps you together because you can't keep yourself now many times in the prayer line the person may look normal come up before the prophet of God but when the spirit begins to concern they see there's all kinds of problems even the Bible says in Deuteronomy 8 and5 it says Thou shalt also consider thine heart in other words you should know this in your heart Brethren that as a man chastises his son or chasen is his son so the Lord thy God chasen thee you want to beat on him you think you're going to beat the devil out of him then God's going to whack on you you know that that's what the Bible says brother Brenham said never never correct your children in Anger right he said you grieve the Holy Spirit you grieve its Angel huh now now most of the time you can't see the problem on the outside because it's a problem of the heart or the spirit in prayer lines you see so many times the people coming forward to be prayed for and sometimes it's a condemning heart they're coming there many times a prayer line will have many people there and they're just there for relief from something they've done and it's condemned their heart the Bible says if our hearts condemn us okay then we we don't have peace with God but a heart that is not condemned then I have peace towards God you see a prayer line isn't just coming up here because you did something wrong let them pray you know and cry a little bit and it's all over no confess you're wrong make it right before you come up to be prayed for God can't even heal you until you do those things first repent make those things right and then come and get prayed for and then watch God heal you instantly I've seen people and myself included the moment you stand up before you even get prayed for you're healed amen brother Brenham so much of the time hundreds and hundreds thousands of times as he breaks into a vision oh I see you there's a lot of trouble on your heart oh you're

by standing with him in the Pulpit come up here and challenge him most of the time he says hey you preachers you you say I'm wrong you come up here and stand right here next to me with the Bible and he says show me where I'm wrong I said none of you moved he said you're smarter than I thought you know the angel of the Lord stands right here next to me so much of the time he oh let me tell you so all of these shimy eyes these Modern Day Men ah the prophet said this he was wrong he this here and everything let me they throwing dirt on God's anointed and upon God's people stay away and keep your

with these other servants curse every disease that's in here May the Jesus Christ the son of God heal every person in your Satan leave these people in Jesus Christ's name now let the people's got their hands up say praise God and go to Rejoice god brother am amen did you see Billy Paul what I told you how he'd get up behind his daddy grab his Bible now he's holding him because he's he's resting in his arms and he's letting the the other minister know I'm taking him away but do you see the discernment it would just go one after another after another and he began to discern I want you to understand that that is the discernment of the Holy Spirit and the Bible says that the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart even to the dividing aunder how many believe that oh my the prophet talks about heart trouble listen to me I studied 1,179 times heart trouble that he discerns in people and much of the time it's not a clogged heart it's heart trouble you got an issue right you've been heartbroken you're depressed you're lonely you're just out of sorts yes and then the next one another sickness that has more hits than that is cancer because he said this a cancer age and he says he says what is it it's a spirit and it starts by being wounded it's a wounded or bruised cell it's what he said and what it does huh and he says and there Cancers and different things within the body and the prophet of God just exposing Spirits he's Discerning Spirits so here's the first quote that I want to show you because brother Brandon remember as Moses was given two signs the sign in the hand and the discernment of spirit I want you to see here it is in the sermon experiences 1947 this is the first quote on brother Brenham talking about heart trouble just to give you an example all right you have the quote ready now she's suffering with a heart trouble which is causing a block in her heart and she's got asthmatic trouble also she's extremely nervous a deep thinker a real worry about things before it happens any body in here like that huh oh my what are we going to do when we get there how long will it take what what if this and what if that ah you may never get there see you must have a very good faith or something where are you from Superior is that Arizona is it why it's the first time that's the fourth person I've ever knowed that felt that vibration the reaction of it because now remember as Moses he's got a sign in the hand and it will actually vibrate and it'll turn a color and watch what he said he says now just bow your head and he tells his sister now you watch my hand sister so he's holding her hand and she's feeling the vibration said sister you watch my hand and if it turns back normal like this one here if that leaves or you can tell it when you feel you see when the feeling of that leaves and my hand will turn normal father I pray for this sister that you will healer thou demon I adure Thee by Jesus Christ the son of the Living God come out of the woman you don't feel it now do you look at my hand now you may raise your head audience that's stopped now hasn't it you don't feel it at all and here's my hand turned wide but in other words his hand went back to normal do you know that brother Billy Paul told me that um brother Brenham could never wear a watch during a time of discernment or praying for people he had a a sful of expensive watches that the moment the anointing of God was on him it had break every watch something Supernatural a power was going on how many believe it was God it was the power of God and he said he daddy could never wear a watch during those times now brother Brenham talks about these two signs that he had and he said he Likens it unto his first and second pull and he also Likens this under fishing you all know I've told you many times so many of the people coming to be prayed for were issues of the heart they're all burdened and troubled in their heart or they have a condemning heart because of sin brother ramam says oh I see you sis but let's just go into this anointed one 1965 and when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pole healing what do that got to do with outer Court the body second poll prophecy what is that that's the spirit third poll the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal that word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pole was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth but that's been sealed in the word now Jesus Christ was the word of God was he not he was the seed Gene of God and when God broke him and broke his heart at Calvary all of the seed attributes of God that was inside encapsulated inside it broke open his heart and when that spear went through his side out came water and blood amen and he had given up the spirit water blood spirit constitutes what a birth and brother Brenham said there at Calvary Christ is birthing A Whole New Testament Church Hallelujah he's now birthing a whole new church his seed was poured out had Satan known what was happening he would have never let him died he would have protected him he would not have killed him but the seed if it remains alone it's got to die he had to die he was the seed he had to die he had to be planted he had to go down to Hell Hallelujah the keys of death and hell and he went down and took all of the Old Testament Saints sir amen so his heart ruptured I'm going to show you some quotes here Hebrews 4 and2 says the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing and suer of Soul and Spirit and of the joints of the marrow and the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so he discerned I want you to understand the the word of God that was coming to him was Discerning between Body Spirit and soul he said you can have have the spirit on your body and you feel it oh I feel the love of God oh but it doesn't change you that's the outer Court he said then you can go to the inner Court which is your spirit and he says and and there you can activate gifts of the Spirit you can prophesy you can do all those things speak in tongues that is not the evidence that you are sealed by the holy spirit it's in evidence that the spirit is there doing something that's all Caiaphas prophesied he didn't have the Holy Ghost so the Holy Spirit begins to discern among the Believers here's where the prophet of God said here's where Pentecost failed here's where these other religions have began to tell you this is the evidence of being baptized of the Holy Spirit he said it was not the operating of the gifts it wasn't Divine Healing speaking in tongues none of those are the evidence of the holy spirit let me give you three quotes here real quick let's just you Brothers follow along all I want to do is just give the highlighted portion pergam and church age I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting or prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth amen that you would be in the word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving the word evidence has to do with receiving the word how many of you have received the word of the Prophet when you've received the the uh uh the word of a prophet you've re you receive a prophet's reward now don't just say it with your oh yeah I I receive it no you got to take it into your heart I'm going to show you why it's Thy word oh Lord have a hid in my heart that I learn not to sin against you most people Miss serving God by about 18 inches from here to here because the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind not in the heart next quote p pergami in church age the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of Our Lord it is the receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word if you got the word The Works follow that's right that's the Bible sardian Church age now I'm sure that you have noticed that those whose names are in the Book of Life Now notice Book of Life not Lamb's Book of Life Book of Life were a part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true God and worship of him though they did not worship according to the truth which is the word like Judas they didn't go all the way see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the Mysteries he had a Ministry of power granted unto him and he he healed the sick and cast out devils in jesus' name but when The Showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit make no mistakes about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receives the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way I didn't capitalize these I just highlighted them but that word all the way is in your church age book already capitalized that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes right there fall right there and when they failed to go on in that word their names are taken off the Book of Life when they fa when you reject the word see there's a lot of people they ask brother Brandon well what about are there people going to be saved and a that don't follow your message oh yeah sure there's people all over the world that if they have a life with Jesus Christ but if they've come up to the word and they deny it he said they can't have the Holy Ghost because how can the Holy Ghost who is the author of the word how can the Holy Ghost deny the the very word it wrote let me say this please listen to it carefully those that leave the message though they had followed it for years never had the Holy Ghost impossible if they did they would still follow the word of the hour it might have been on their body or on their Spirit that's right done the works of the spirit done all this kind of stuff felted and oo and awe and all that jumped and shouted but let me tell you when you leave the word you leave Christ he is the word right now when Christ comes into your heart we're talking about heart issues when Christ comes into your heart he sits on the throne room of your heart how many of you know the three circles Body Spirit Soul he says that outer part he said you you're a three-part person Body Spirit and soul soul soul being the inside of the inside he said now you can have the anointing of you on your body and oh you feel good and you raise up your hands and oh praise God and all that he says you can let the sunshine shine on a rock and it feels all warm and fuzzy but it never brings life why there's no seed it feels the sunlight many of those those that go to church feel God's love oh love oh God is love and they sit there excuse me I'm not being critical but you have to understand and I'm going to show you and I I I I got a good another 25 minutes my wife told me she says honey she gives me a kiss she says stay focused don't tell stories and she was walking away I said it sounds like Jill Biden I said I'm not that bad honey you answered all the questions right anyway so I I try I try my wife's bless her heart I love her she just yeah she he's the better half of me that's for sure now watch this sits on the throne room of your heart watch this the infallible proof of the Resurrection the sin question settled when the Holy Spirit comes into the human heart where human heart it casts down reasoning it goes above your intellectual affair because there's an intellectual conception of Christ in other words it's in the mind and not in the heart but when he comes into the heart it's Faith what is Faith it's a revelation see it's positive there's no question about it it's all settled forever it's in your heart and your heart doesn't reason because it's the throne The Dwelling Place of the almighty in the heart when Christ sits on the throne room of your heart he goes from being Lord to master and you say and you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am right many have him as Lord right very few have him as Master when your heart is united with the heart of God your heart and his heart become one brother Brenham says in a personal experience with God 1954 I come to find out that Christ is the very Heart Of God he is God's heart Jesus Christ is God's heart isn't that a lovely quote the very essence of all that was God he was the very heart the heart throb of God he was love he was healing he was virtue he was Kinsman he was all he was the very Heart Of God am Jesus Christ died then of a broken heart he came to preach the gospel to the poor he says and I am come to heal the brokenhearted aren't you glad that you have a God who can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities you ever been brokenhearted something so tragic so traumatic that you can't even share it with someone else a brother told me the other day he says something happened in my life I cried for he says I cried so hard I could not open my eyes for three days that's pretty traumatic would you say Amen to that yeah wow in the first seal now as we study the chapter we're referring to different places even to the Old and New Testament alike because the entire book is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's that's all together the revelation of the Lord Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ it's God revealing himself in the book revealing himself through Christ in the book and Christ is the revelation of God and he comes to reveal God because he and God were the same God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself you'd never know just what God was until he reveal himself through Christ see Christ is the very Heart Of God let me be bold enough to say this too you would have never known the God of this Bible until you heard this message you would have heard about a historic God or a theological God you know that he's love and he's this and that and all all of the different things and like a great Wagon Wheel and the Hub is God and all of these spokes are all the religions of the world and you know one is Buddha and one is Muhammad and one is this and what it is is it's just religion and we're all going but the center is God Jesus said no man comes to the father but by me I am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father amen but by me well then would you show us the father and and Jesus said have I been with you for so long that if you've seen me if you had revelation of who I am you've seen the father because I and my father are one he did not come to reveal himself he said the son can do nothing except the father reveal it to him first amen Isaiah 53:2 says therefore I will divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he ha poured out his soul unto death he poured out his soul unto death now I began to look through the scripture and we know that Christ is also a perfect example of the Pascal lamb the lamb that was to be slain to shed its blood because without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin as it says there in Isaiah he poured out his soul the Hebrew word Soul actually means his life same word this I don't know how you say it nefes and it comes from the same Hebrew word that is translated to life the Bible says in Leviticus 1711 for the life same Hebrew word neesh for of the flesh is in the blood so watch the prophet divide now between spirit and soul hang on with me there okay Christ revealed in his own word the five senses on the outer realm that it has five senses to the body and that's see taste smell feel here you cannot contact this body except by one or all of those senses but to contact the spirit which which is the inside of that it has five gateways also memory imaginations conscience affection and reasoning five gates and many people are touched by one of those gates to the spirit let me give you an example brother Brenham his first sermon he preached and after the service was over he had he asked his Pastor okay brother Davis how did I do he said horrible well the people cried I cried they all cried they ah they cried baby showers and all kinds of stuff he said bill you never preach the word he thought because he was emotional and he got people crying and used perhaps the channel of imagination oh your grandmother died you loved her didn't you oh you want to see your grandma in heaven I'll tell you what what you better live a good life yes Grandma I want to see grandma again using the channel of imagination or don't can you just imagine how nice heaven will be and it'll be so wonderful no sorrow no heartache yes yes and people come and they cry and it's their channel to their emotion and it never goes to the soul and he says they come up and cry big crocodile tears and he says have you ever heard a goat cry it cries like a sheep he said it takes a real Shepherd to know the difference okay so now you got memory oh memory let's let's go down memory lane and you know yes yes like some girls do when they dated a boy in high school and they hear a song in the radio in the car oh Bobby Bobby you know it ain't Bobby it's Ronnie and you're sitting in Ronnie's car if you want Bobby anyway just Sandy didn't do that thank you s no no so don't look at her she didn't do that she's not guilty of that now the inside of that man is the spirit and it has five senses and they and just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field they can be Anointed with the same holy spirit that the real believer is Anointed with but down on the inside of the next realm the Third Realm is the soul and that's the predestinated by God there is where the real seed germ lays in there brother RM said until you ask Christ to come into your heart and he sits on the throne room and your heart he actually drew a picture and in the center of the heart or the soul he says he drew a throne like a chair and a serpent and he says when that spirit of God comes in it kills the serpent first the old nature amen and now he sits on the throne of your heart and now he's in control cuz that's the control room you got it all right and he says that's where the real seed germ lays so if in Christ who was the seed Gene of God inside of his heart when it ruptured what came forth all of those seed jeans and the devil doesn't know how to handle you if he could have but you know what all of you were planted in different seasons none of you came up in Ephesus thyra you came up in laiaa you never got a choice if you would have you'd have never chose ladia it's the worst of all ages and yet it's the best of all ages amen I've said before when we get over there and we mingle around with those what age are you from oh Ephesus oh you in the the days of Paul oh wonderful that was great oh praise the Lord they ask you uh and what age do you come from l l youa really how did you do it right oh wasn't nothing yeah I was yeah Hallelujah you're going to you're going to say it was him it was him it wasn't me I didn't hold on to God God held on to me every time I fell he picked me up every time I made a mistake there was a mediator every time I did something wrong the blood was there and blood covered the multitudes of my sins somebody say hallelujah hallelujah true Jesus poured out his soul under death watch this blasphemi his names 62 it was the Holy Spirit that birthed the saman church the holy spirit that give the pergamus church and the thy church and Dark Ages it's the holy spirit that built that bride the elect that's pulled out of all organization systems down Through the Ages like that there's an elected a predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that's the Holy Spirit called out the elect and it's been the Holy Ghost in This age that age that that that that on to the top the Holy Spirit and when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit cements it together there is the baptism of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah when his heart bursts like the doctors explain the stress caused the water and blood to separate within the heart and the pericardium around him Jesus was crucified in stress and agony of being scourged in the loss of blood he carried his own cross up the hill until he fell under its load and they had a black man to pick up his cross that's what brother Bram said do you know that brother Bram said that a colored man a black man is born more n he says is by nature more spiritual than a white man it's just their nature I think you know what I think I think because of a black man carrying the cross I think they got an extra special blessing that's that's just me I could be wrong but you know what you let a black group get together let them get to worshiping he says you get a black chorus you don't have to harmonize and tell them no you just let them start singing next thing you know they're all moving in one they're going back and forth like like seaweed in the ocean when the current is going like this they're all just moving they're just natural they get hey they're just they just get into it they they all become Blended as a voice huh yeah they used to in the South out there picking cotton when they had blood going down their backs because they had been beaten they would sing spiritual H uh uh Psalms and hymns Swing Low Sweet Cher all the people in the field would start singing come and For To Carry Me Home brother brm said you watch these UFOs these things that they they call them UFOs he said one of these days they're going to come down pick you up have you noticed all these UFOs and all these drones and everything else huh I don't know I think if they're drones I think president Trump elect Trump said you know what shoot them down if they're not ours that's what I say anyway what I'm seeing brother Steve you brought from your from your work you remember the camera you brought what kind of a camera do they call that thermogenic or something like that you you go and what it is it's a camera and and you look through it and if a bearing or something on this uh line or carrying all this tonnage of of stuff coming out of the ground the ore and if it's starting to seiz up and heats it it now puts off heat and he took the camera and he says oh you can tell what what part on this is going to break down because it's getting hot man I don't I can't see it but if I put the thermal imagery on it boy it just shows up this bearing is about ready to go out and they would fix it and he said but now brother Ron let me give it to you he says just start looking around with it you remember see it I start looking up all of a sudden I said what is the put it down put it back up little things flying everywhere do you remember that steeve everybody else that got to see whoa what is that let me tell you there are things that we don't understand that're Even in our atmosphere and there all around us huh I don't know maybe they're little licks of fire remember that's what happened on the day of pen because licks of fire they began to see them but these licks of fire had been somewhere before hallelujah oh a making up some kind of theological deal D don't worry about it I'm not off but I'm telling you there's some things unexplainable I said Steve what are they said I don't know even my boss said I don't know what it is but they're there anyway we can change our minds can't we we can change our surroundings we can change our sh our our our church but we cannot change our heart it takes God it takes God to take he says I will take out of you oh man the Stony heart of Flesh you that didn't care about anybody or anything and you were just doing your thing I will take out of you that Stony heart of Flesh and I will put in a new spirit huh and I will give you a heart huh a new heart and he says and I'll give you a new spirit and he says many people think that is the holy spirit he said no and many people stop right there he said no what that is he said God's got to give you a new spirit so you'll get along with the Holy Spirit when it comes otherwise you're going to fight and argue about no I ain't going to do that how long is long how short it's short you just argue about everything you can see it in the in the word well why does God care about my hair why does God care about you know the way I dress well you get the Holy Spirit he sits on the throne room of your heart there's no question there's no question let the Holy Spirit Come into any one of your hearts and let me tell you if you're a female you won't have to worry about immoral dress you'll not put it on why it'll grieve the Holy Spirit you'll look in the mirror and go oh man I can't wear that huh why the holy spirit inside of you is the filter huh the holy spirit's the filter amen amen you know what you all are going to have to be tested and put under pressure yes sir to see really what you believe yeah it's true yeah nobody likes pressure nobody likes having to be tested three us test test test why are we always having tests nobody likes to be tested I remember my twin brother had a he had it was one of I think it was Rosal ski binding and it says engineered to go the limit I got a sermon off that you know what I tell you what a you are engineered to go to the Limit every one of you are engineered to go to the limit you may think that you're right there and you're about ready to break but you know what he said there'll never be anything on you that you cannot bear but what I will make away of Escape for you so there'll never be anything oh it's too great it's too hard I just can't oh no you just got to let go and let God engineered to go the limit all right brother Brenham said in the mighty conqueror hang on with me just for a few more minutes well we're right at 12:00 some of you are yeah be honest your Halo drops at 12:00 and if there's anything that makes a Christians lazy it's when they're on a flowery bed of ease we don't have persecutions enough we don't have it hard enough that's a good quote for some of you it's too hard you don't have it hard enough always the chain is strong as it the weakest L man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure his real true characteristic will show when he's under pressure get him all uh riled stirred up then you'll see the real man come out if he's got a temper it'll show itself if he's meak and G a little show it put them under pressure once God puts all children under test to see whether there's any flaws in them you ever didn't pass the test and you saw where failure was you do not pass go and collect $200 this is not Monopoly you go through that test until you pass it and when you're put up under a test when you're fixing to be used for God for a testimony think of that when you're fixing to be used of God for a testimony like the lady here in the wheelchair the man the little boy some of the people out there maybe you Christians and wonder why you're put under the test God's fixing to use your testimony but he wants to see how you'll react so he puts the pressure on if you blow up well then he can't do nothing with you but if you'll hold on stand the test United under one head I'm I musicians who have come I'm going to bring this to a close here real quick they sit down there and blow up like a toad frog eating Buckshot I've never seen that but I have mental imagery and he can carry an all carry on awful when he knows no more about God than a hot and HT knows about an Egyptian nights you know that's the truth go down and see the glory of God and somebody get healed and say it's psychology how can you believe when you've got nothing to believe with if God's on your heart's Throne I tell you he will agree with every word you sisters that sang that song I believe that blessed me so much because you know what what do you do I just believe I can't explain it all I don't understand understand why God does certain things I don't but I believe because I was born to believe I was born for this message God says unbelievers say I doubt that God says amen the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Holy Spirit says amen the church Creed will say well he's in uh so much he is uh I'm the Lord heals all thy disease as well he used to but the Holy Spirit on the heart notice he's always going back to the heart we're talking about heart issues but the Holy Spirit on the heart will say Amen to every word of God because he wrote it he is the writer he is the author the unbelieving scientific polish scholar with a DD PhD dou l d all that kind of nonsense they'll disagree with it because they don't know any different like the old colored man was down in the South he kept singing and his boss said said what's makes you so happy he said I got heartfelt religion h no such thing at heartfelt religion boss you made one mistake what's that you should have you should have said there's no such thing as heartfelt religion as far as you know CU you don't know is this apple sweet or sour I don't know I haven't bitten into it that's your problem don't ever let your heart get hardened let me just talk over one other thing here because many times we come to church our heart is hardened why certain things issues come up attitudes complexes somebody said something well he said over here oh I don't care hey we're too far along now we're too mature to have those childish issues Hebrews 3: 12-1 15 take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you should be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast Until the End while it is say today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation sometimes mere association with inconsistent and weak Christians have been the downfall of many younger Christians because it was a wrong influence hardening of the heart is a process it takes time doesn't happen overnight it's a process how do you get calluses on your hands any of you ever got a callus you ever worked and worked with your hands enough I remember framing houses until my hands were just I had yellow calluses all over from using a hammer how do you get it from daily rubbing against the skin and it gets calloused takes a process you don't get calluses overnight takes a while so it is a callous heart a hardened heart well he said this one said and I I won't hey I'm not going to make it right oh my quit being childish love one another with an unfaded love if they said it so what go on hey any of you have ever had somebody hurt you you're wounded somebody said something and ah maybe you got heartbroke over it Sister Sarah it was no coincidence that you volunteered and when I ask you to act like your heart broke you said I been there how many of you can say I've experienced a heartbreak at some time in my life yeah look at those hands you know what it's not nice doesn't feel good there's a lot of Tears there's a lot of ah all kinds of complexities about it but you know what I love the fact that Jesus said I'm going to preach the gospel and I'm going to heal up the broken I'm going to heal their wounds and the only way he can do it is when he sits on your throne that's why we sing those songs prepare our hearts created me a clean heart soften my my heart with oil we sing all these songs about the heart because it's the most important part of your body it's an involuntary muscle you don't tell it to move you don't tell it that when you lay down and you sit up you don't tell it to increase its heartbeat it automatically does it and let me say that you're just a Heartbeat Away from God right now because if something happen I I asked Sandy the other day I said Sandy come over here give me a hug yeah any of you ever just need a hug once a while like Sarah you said can I give you a hug and I had Sandy I said Sandy I just need a hug come over here I needed a hug I put my head on her chest and my ear was right there above her heart and it was I I thought oh God blessed is her heart because it follows God and it loves God and it blessed me it told me I said I Sandy I heard your heartbeat I said it was so good knowing that that heart is true and it beats for God Ephesians 4 and then I'm going to go to one more scripture and I'm going to close I'm not going to go into the rest Ephesians 4 this I say therefore in testifying the Lord that we henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart that's a heart issue isn't it a blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness foolishness do things that are not pleasing to God because of the blindness of their heart Jeremiah 17:9 and 10 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it oh I just I just want to do my own thing do what's on my heart yeah the heart is desperately wicked who can know it I the Lord search the heart and I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings you know I'm going to I'm going to do something here that I don't normally do and I'm kind of I know but those sisters that sang that song Believe can I get you to come up here and sing it again before we leave one more time I want to be blessed I want to be blessed come up here musicians if you got
