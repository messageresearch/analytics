[13:32] all to the house of the Lord tonight.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; I know there's a number of people from
[13:36] Canada visiting. We just want to welcome
[13:38] you here tonight to worship with us. We
[13:41] just want to make sure that the Lord is
[13:42] welcome here tonight. Amen. He's so good
[13:45] to us. He's more than enough for

[13:50] &gt;&gt; Just want to take our needs to the Lord.
[13:51] Brother Steve McNeely could come and
[13:53] pray for these. First, our sister Sharon
[13:56] Johnson, she has pneumonia. She's in the
[13:59] hospital. Our brother David Rutled is in
[14:02] rehab at least another week.
[14:06] Also, our sister Debia Cell, if you'd
[14:08] keep her in prayer, she's also in rehab.
[14:12] Our sister Julie Prank is recovering.
[14:14] She'll be using a walker for another
[14:16] three weeks.
[14:18] Brother Declan Love all is homesick. And
[14:21] if we just keep these needs in in our
[14:24] prayer tonight, the Lord is mindful. One
[14:27] last one, just pray for Alexis William,
[14:30] cousin of Sister Anna Inigas, on her way
[14:33] to the ER with a heart issue. Thank you.
[14:36] Amen. The Lord is mindful for us.
[14:38] Brother Steve, if you just take these to
[14:40] the Lord.
[14:44] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[14:46] Lord, this is more than a song that
[14:49] we've been singing, but it's a reality,
[14:51] Father. And we can say that you are more
[14:53] than enough for us, Lord. You are
[14:56] Jehovah Jarra, Jehovah Nissi, Lord. All
[14:59] of our needs that we have on this
[15:01] earthly journey, we know that you have
[15:03] already provided, Lord. So, Father God,
[15:06] we come to you with confidence this
[15:08] evening, knowing that all things are in
[15:10] thy hands and you are in control of
[15:12] everything, Father. Therefore, that
[15:14] gives us a comfort in our hearts. It
[15:17] gives us a peace in our hearts, Father.
[15:20] That Lord, though the the waves may
[15:23] tempest and the rain may come, yet we
[15:25] know the master of the wind and the
[15:28] master of the rain. Father God, we ask
[15:30] this evening that you would come by by
[15:33] the foolishness of preaching. That you
[15:35] would speak to our hearts, Lord. Father,
[15:37] that whatever the need would be, that
[15:40] Lord, your your prophet told us that the
[15:43] word of the hour will meet the need of
[15:45] the hour. So let the word come forth.
[15:47] Let it meet our needs, Lord, and help us
[15:49] to set aside the cares of life, Father,
[15:53] that your word may have an effect that
[15:55] we might receive, believe, Lord, and and
[15:58] conceive, Lord, and bring forth life. We
[16:01] love you. We thank you. We commit all
[16:03] things, all these prayer requests, Lord,
[16:05] that have been penned. We commit each
[16:08] and every life into thy hands.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are expecting a great move of
[16:13] God in our lives. We are expecting,
[16:16] Lord, good reports, Father. Lord, we
[16:20] hear a lot these days of the doctor's
[16:22] report, but we believe your report. We
[16:26] love you, Lord, and we commit these
[16:27] things into thy hands for thy glory in
[16:29] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[16:41] If we could also just remember our
[16:43] brother Neil N. He goes in early on
[16:46] Friday for a serious heart procedure.
[16:48] Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Let's
[16:51] just remember our brother Neil.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord's sure been with him
[16:55] every step of the way. We're just
[16:57] trusting
[16:58] &gt;&gt; he's going to stay right with him. We
[16:59] just have a couple of announcements.
[17:02] First off, uh, for Friday as well at
[17:05] 7:30m, we have the seven church aid
[17:08] series starting. That's going to be in
[17:10] the senior youth room here at the church
[17:12] at 7:30.
[17:14] And then also,
[17:16] we just want to wish our brother
[17:17] Brighton Mapoya a blessed happy birthday
[17:20] today. Amen. God bless brother Brighton.

[17:25] together again. Just praising the Lord.

[19:59] Firing line. Firing line. Oh, if you're
[20:02] in the battle for the Lord and ride,
[20:07] keep on the firing line.
[20:12] And if you win, my brother, surely you
[20:15] must fight.
[20:17] Keep on the firing line.
[20:21] And there are many dangers that we all
[20:25] must face.
[20:27] If we die fighting, it is no disgrace.
[20:31] Empowered
[20:32] in the service, he will find no place.
[20:36] Don't keep on the firing line.
[20:41] You must fight. Be brave against all
[20:46] evil. Never ever run nor even lag
[20:50] behind.
[20:52] If you would win for God and the
[20:56] righteous, keep on the firing line.
[21:02] And God will only use a soldier he can
[21:05] trust. Just keep on the firing line.
[21:12] If you wear a crown, then bear the
[21:14] cross, you must
[21:17] keep on the firing line.
[21:22] And life is but to labor for the master.
[21:27] Help to vanish. He will land and spread
[21:30] good cheer.
[21:32] You'll be rewarded for your service
[21:36] here. So keep on the firing line.
[21:42] You must fight to be brave against all
[21:46] you.
[21:48] Never ever run or even lag behind.
[21:53] If you were to wait for God and the
[21:56] light, just keep on the firing line.
[22:03] When we get to heaven, brother, we'll be
[22:06] glad.
[22:08] Keep on the firing line.
[22:12] And how we praise the Savior for the
[22:15] call we had.
[22:18] Keep on the firing line.
[22:23] And when we see the souls that we have
[22:25] helped to win and leading them to Jesus
[22:30] on the path of sin
[22:33] with a shout of welcome we will all mar
[22:39] the firing line.
[22:42] You must fight. Be brave against all.
[22:48] Never run or even lack behind.
[22:53] If you would

[23:01] your life.

[32:40] Amen.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you saints. Uh without
[32:44] further delay, uh take our let's take
[32:46] our Bible in the book of uh John chapter
[32:50] 1.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; We'll read the first eight verses.
[33:15] Hallelujah.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Uh, we don't. In the beginning was the
[33:20] word and the word was with God and the
[33:23] word was God. The same was in the
[33:27] beginning with God. All things were made
[33:29] by him and without him was nothing made
[33:33] that was by that was made.
[33:36] In in him was life and the life was the
[33:40] light of men and the light shineth in
[33:44] darkness and the darkness comprehendeth
[33:47] it not. There was a man sent from God
[33:51] whose name was John.
[33:54] The same came for a witness to bear
[33:58] witness of the light that all men
[34:02] through him might believe. He was not
[34:06] that light but was sent to bear witness
[34:10] of that light. May the Lord bless you.
[34:13] You may be seated. Uh tonight uh we will
[34:17] uh
[34:19] take uh time to uh break into Jeremiah's
[34:24] ministry
[34:26] as uh we did uh in introduction of it
[34:29] last night. I mean uh in the
[34:34] watch service God's grace and we believe
[34:37] we'll go bit by bit not rushing but not
[34:42] also not expending too much on the
[34:45] mother so that by God's grace we can be
[34:48] able to
[34:50] uh be able to understand and what God is
[34:53] uh the purpose behind everything that uh
[34:57] he likes to do.
[34:59] Jeremiah's ministry and uh we'll be
[35:01] speaking about God's condescension. I
[35:04] understand that the English dictionary
[35:06] doesn't define condescensation as the
[35:10] way Barnham uses it but we take the
[35:13] prophet's ways of uh applying it and uh
[35:18] just to give it a little bit more
[35:19] context and morph
[35:22] um we see that uh in the book of John
[35:27] uh
[35:28] is a man that the prophet qualifies as a
[35:32] man of love men who receive a lot of
[35:35] revelation
[35:37] uh and by uh God's grace in the
[35:40] beginning
[35:42] u Matthew, Mark, Luke and himself
[35:47] spoke about Jesus but um he's uh one of
[35:53] the person that goes before the
[35:56] foundation of the world and uh he
[35:59] started bringing all this uh idea about
[36:03] as uh he's laying that pattern says like
[36:06] from the beginning was the word and the
[36:08] word was with God and the word was made
[36:11] flesh and uh and dwelt among us
[36:16] um and uh people didn't understand what
[36:20] was uh what was happening why was the
[36:25] word coming and was this man the word
[36:29] what was it was a quite a quite a confus
[36:31] confusion and uh it seems to be the same
[36:35] way it is also in the days that we are
[36:38] living in but uh Jesus Christ is the
[36:41] same yesterday, today and forever. Uh
[36:44] those things are called to to happen in
[36:47] order to for the word uh to be to be
[36:52] made manifest
[36:54] uh in this way that we are in the
[36:58] message.
[37:00] Uh we have uh so many things that uh we
[37:06] have learned over the years. Uh we've
[37:09] been preached uh different things and
[37:12] people have taken different paths and by
[37:14] God's grace. But then we understand that
[37:16] at times
[37:20] it's uh due to the way the word was
[37:23] given to people. People have
[37:26] read left and right up and down and they
[37:28] end up with all kind of conclusions. But
[37:31] God is rich in mercy has uh made uh used
[37:35] the people along along the along the
[37:39] years and uh the brothers from uh
[37:42] Shakina and um voice of God recordings
[37:46] to make as many messages available as
[37:50] possible so people can be able to
[37:54] realign uh with God's thought. And along
[37:58] the years uh uh you see that you know
[38:01] because of everything that have come
[38:03] about some have desired like you know
[38:05] you can only listen to the prophet and
[38:07] you can only the stuff this you can only
[38:11] uh go to church and all these things but
[38:14] then as uh you we take the word the
[38:17] prophet shows us that you know the truth
[38:18] is always in the middle. uh once you
[38:21] stay in the middle you always find the
[38:23] balance you always find the truth that
[38:25] uh all things are very wonderful because
[38:29] why because God was coming in and when
[38:32] God comes in more people want to get
[38:35] hold of one form only because they feel
[38:38] so safe around that form you get in the
[38:41] church people have preferences of
[38:43] ministers I like this form one is
[38:45] preaching this form and stuff but it's
[38:48] exactly what John is uh showing us here
[38:51] that God in the beginning was the word
[38:54] and this uh very word
[38:57] people couldn't understand uh how it was
[39:01] possible that God could be made flesh.
[39:05] Uh brother Bernham speaks here in live
[39:07] 57. Let's close our eyes to our
[39:10] imaginations a few moments and go way
[39:14] back into before there was anything. The
[39:18] great fountain of all eternity was this
[39:21] that spirit of love, that spirit of
[39:24] honesty, that spirit of trness in need
[39:28] in this perfection. And then out of the
[39:30] existence of the father which was the
[39:33] spirit uh went the logos. Uh in this
[39:37] time that uh god was uh all living by
[39:42] himself meaning the spirit before they
[39:44] be any elements that we know through
[39:47] science. Let it be atoms or molecules or
[39:51] or anything that we can call today sand
[39:54] or trees. uh this great fountain of love
[39:58] of purity understood that it was time
[40:02] for myself to get started to do certain
[40:05] things because brother Bernham says that
[40:07] he had everything in his mind. He took
[40:09] the time in his mind to just
[40:11] conceptualize everything.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; He took the time to point like you know
[40:16] I'll uh have some trees, I'll have a
[40:18] man, I'll have uh I'll do this over time
[40:22] and all these things here were just in
[40:24] his mind. But then all these things sure
[40:27] were not word yet because it was just
[40:29] seeds in him. Just like anybody will
[40:32] have ideas like you know I'll get
[40:34] married and I'll think that she will be
[40:37] my wife but until you tell her you
[40:40] propose to her to be that she will never
[40:43] be and uh therefore uh along these years
[40:48] or these years years isn't time but
[40:50] along God's eternal mind he had all
[40:54] these things he had figured out and he
[40:57] he understood that I'll be able to do
[40:59] this Then uh the first step that he took
[41:03] in order for him to fulfill all these
[41:05] desires. Um he said that let me create
[41:09] myself uh let me come out of me comes
[41:12] the first creation which is a body. And
[41:16] uh went the logos which was the son
[41:19] meaning that God could now have a place
[41:22] that he could work from.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; And this place that he could work from
[41:26] was the son. Not necessarily that uh the
[41:30] son was uh eternal because the son had
[41:35] the beginning the very time that he was
[41:37] created. But the eternal one, this
[41:40] eternal un uh um unseen spirit was able
[41:44] now to find a way to dwell in the logos
[41:49] which was the son which was brotherham
[41:51] say a theophony which is which was the
[41:55] body of the great Jehovah God went forth
[41:59] in the celestial body that's the logos
[42:02] the word spoke out of the the the the
[42:06] great fountains of life and went forth.
[42:09] And when he expressed himself, the first
[42:11] time he expressed himself, he was
[42:14] creating a body that could he could
[42:16] dwell himself into. And by him creating
[42:20] that body, it was now the first stage,
[42:23] the first display that the world or the
[42:26] the the the eternal God was uh made
[42:30] manifest in a certain body. And that
[42:33] body says um identify Christ of all
[42:38] ages. Remember God changes his form
[42:42] &gt;&gt; and morph the Greek word means he puts
[42:46] on a different mask.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; And uh in this very first mask it was
[42:52] the unseen God because Moses wanted to
[42:55] see God and he said that no man can see
[42:57] God and leave. But then the only way
[43:00] that he was able to be seen by Moses, he
[43:04] had to have a mask. And this mask now
[43:08] he's a um a different mask like uh like
[43:12] in Cameron or something or Shakespeare's
[43:16] play. He's like an actor. He changes his
[43:19] form. All those prophets were that was
[43:23] God in those prophets. So now God was
[43:27] able is coming down is now showing that
[43:31] hey I was able to do it for my own body
[43:35] now I'm also able to do it with the
[43:38] prophets. So anything that could have
[43:41] seemed impossible that this great
[43:44] fountain of God because human mind will
[43:46] try to conceptualize that spirit as a a
[43:52] fullfilling spirit where he ties
[43:57] everything in himself.
[43:59] But then for him to explain to us
[44:02] exactly what is happening he said I'll
[44:05] just create a body
[44:06] &gt;&gt; and that body is the logos and
[44:08] brotherham says here that that body
[44:13] says call it theophony the atonement
[44:16] that when we leave here we go in
[44:19] somewhere else whatever it may be it's
[44:22] it takes the apostle words I takes I
[44:26] take the the apostles word when he said
[44:29] If this earthly tabernacle or dwelling
[44:32] place be dissolved, we have one already
[44:35] waiting to move from this into that.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Remember that we are moving from a body
[44:44] into another body. Meaning this body is
[44:49] an empty body. When God creates a body,
[44:53] it is an empty body until the very God
[44:57] comes into that body because the shadows
[45:01] that we are is the exactly what God was
[45:04] doing because God is the same yesterday,
[45:07] today and forever. And if he did it
[45:11] himself for his logos into which he
[45:14] went,
[45:16] then there's nothing impossible to take
[45:19] us from this earthly body into that
[45:21] heavenly body.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; But that's not the focus of us going
[45:25] into that body. But I'm showing God
[45:28] coming down taking a form by which
[45:32] people now he can start to create
[45:35] because from that logos theophony that's
[45:38] where we could read in Genesis 1 it said
[45:41] like let's make man after our own image
[45:44] and likeness
[45:46] because this man that is being created
[45:48] is also being created in like manner as
[45:51] God was. God has to create a spirit that
[45:55] is male and female in order now to take
[45:58] a part of himself to put into this body
[46:02] which is also Adam's and Eve theophony.
[46:06] So we see now that uh God is coming down
[46:10] as uh uh James 2:26
[46:13] uh says for as a body without the spirit
[46:18] is dead. Right?
[46:20] &gt;&gt; So faith without works is dead also.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; So therefore God who believed in
[46:27] everything that he was
[46:30] without getting into that theophony the
[46:33] logos his works are dead because he has
[46:37] to create he has to display. without him
[46:41] displaying or bringing forth what he had
[46:44] in his mind, his faith is dead because
[46:46] there's no works abiding with it.
[46:51] So therefore God as he's coming down
[46:54] he's saying like you know and the logos
[46:57] uh thirsting for life which was the son
[47:00] of God went out created by these great
[47:03] fountains of purity and those spirits
[47:07] went out and it created the logos and it
[47:10] was a body it was in a form of what we
[47:15] are now. So therefore this theophony
[47:18] that we are speaking about it looks just
[47:21] like the way we are yes of course it is
[47:24] represented many times like you know as
[47:27] just a a set of light but but God's
[47:30] grace that's why I say like you know
[47:32] with the message but God's grace we see
[47:34] we have a totally different picture so
[47:37] that this is in the form of what we are
[47:41] now and it was a body it was in the form
[47:45] of what we are which is called in a
[47:48] clergy way of speaking speaking it a
[47:50] theophony.
[47:52] It's a body that doesn't have a spirit
[47:55] in it.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; So God is creating this body and goes
[48:01] into that body.
[48:04] The whole sufficient God everything that
[48:07] he was he was able to condense himself
[48:11] into that body
[48:14] &gt;&gt; to start to create. Then we see on the
[48:17] first day God created on the second day
[48:20] he created on the third he created on
[48:22] the fourth the fifth the sixth but then
[48:25] on the seventh day he was not satisfied
[48:28] that he created all these things because
[48:31] according to his program that he had in
[48:34] his mind he said I want to do all these
[48:37] things but then there was no man to till
[48:40] the soil and so therefore God took from
[48:44] the earth and uh he took a part of that
[48:48] theophony and put in the earthly man
[48:50] that we call uh Adam.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; And now so this Adam that was in a
[48:57] earthly man out of the dust of the earth
[49:01] plus a portion of the theophony that was
[49:03] created after the image of God male and
[49:06] female he put that into the man and the
[49:09] man in return now he found himself
[49:12] lonely. Baram says, "Look at Adam who
[49:14] was right there seeing how the cows were
[49:17] walking, how the horses were walking and
[49:19] everything. But he was alone.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; He had nothing to do with it. He was not
[49:25] sufficient. He couldn't find himself in
[49:27] the image of God fully." Brenham say he
[49:31] was not all together yet as he was
[49:33] supposed to be.
[49:35] So therefore, but then all these things
[49:37] as they're coming about, God is only
[49:39] unfolding his program bit by bit.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Just as we would say like, you know, we
[49:44] send one segment at a time. We're
[49:46] revealing one episode at a time. And as
[49:50] Isa unfolded these things, then God knew
[49:53] that I need to put Adam in a condition
[49:57] by which he had to fall. And by if Adam
[50:00] can fall, he'll be a great situation so
[50:03] that I can be able to unfold the next
[50:05] segments of what I have. And in another
[50:08] frame of the picture, Adam find himself
[50:11] that he goes to sleep and a woman is
[50:15] brought out of him and uh the other
[50:18] part, the feminist part of Adam was put
[50:20] into brought to Adam and he said,
[50:23] "Behold this time flesh of my flesh of
[50:26] my bones.
[50:28] God looked at it, it was not enough.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; He had to unfold another frame of the
[50:35] picture. He said, "Well, Adam is doing
[50:37] good and it's this here, but my
[50:40] everything I have in my mind is not
[50:42] enough." Then God puts activates a seed
[50:47] in uh one of the angels to bring him to
[50:51] try to find himself to look like God.
[50:54] After a while, he went along the streets
[50:58] of heaven and he find twothird of the
[51:00] angels and he made his campaign and like
[51:03] just any good politicians. Oh, I'll give
[51:06] you a new road system in the land. I'll
[51:09] give give you jobs and and all the
[51:12] angels saw that he was so wonderful. Oh,
[51:15] you'll have you'll make a a a land that
[51:17] is a kingdom that is better than
[51:19] Michael's. Oh, I'm for that.
[51:22] We are living in a very primitive stage
[51:25] and the only thing that we do every day
[51:27] is just praising him, praising him. We
[51:29] need something else.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; So it is also in the church today as we
[51:34] desire every time that a minister comes
[51:37] on the pulpit, we need something new.
[51:39] Yeah.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; And that very same mind that it started
[51:42] now bringing people that it to the
[51:45] position that when there's nothing new
[51:48] on the pulpit then they finding
[51:50] themselves now they are stuck
[51:51] backsliding before you find yourself
[51:54] then people are leaving the church why
[51:56] because they were not able to wait for
[51:58] God's program and as it was unfolding
[52:02] &gt;&gt; because God knew that time will come
[52:05] that I'll have to come down and
[52:07] fellowship with you and teach you things
[52:10] that are much greater. But Eve said, he
[52:13] said, "No, no, no, no. This is enough. I
[52:16] know all the discernments in the tapes
[52:18] and I've seen you Adam called giving
[52:20] names and uh uh revealing the nature of
[52:24] all the animals, but this is not enough.
[52:26] I need a whole new Adam being." We
[52:30] understand that Eve is not uh a seed of
[52:34] the devil but it was in the nature of
[52:37] men to desire always something new. Just
[52:41] as we see in time that human beings are
[52:44] not always happy with what they have.
[52:46] They always need some new with some new
[52:49] stuff.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; We need to conquer a little bit. Oh, if
[52:52] you love me, you need to take me to the
[52:54] restaurant. After the restaurant, like
[52:56] you know, you need to take me to Paris.
[52:58] After Paris, I've traveled all over the
[53:00] world. It's not enough. After we've went
[53:04] all over the world, okay, now you need
[53:05] to take me to the moon.
[53:08] Why? Human being is always searching for
[53:12] something better and greater.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; So therefore, now God knowing how he
[53:18] created the man, he knew with a with a
[53:22] clear understanding that I'll be able to
[53:24] provide because I am Jehovah Gyra. I
[53:28] will be able to provide to everything.
[53:29] But it's according to my timeline. It's
[53:32] according to the way I've laid out
[53:34] things.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And here we are. We see now that in the
[53:38] beginning, we would see Jesus. In the
[53:41] beginning, God was a spirit. And all the
[53:44] fountain of goodness and mercy and power
[53:46] and all the good things of love,
[53:51] God was the center of that fountain.
[53:54] Amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; The Lord, he's standing there. He's
[53:58] looking. He's surrounding. He He has
[54:00] everything with him.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "Adam, I'll give it to you.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; I am the center of all this here,
[54:07] &gt;&gt; but I'll bring it according to my own
[54:10] timing and according to my own state.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; But then remember now the only time that
[54:16] every every uh evening God was coming
[54:18] down in the form of the light." But say
[54:21] the man came out of the light. He would
[54:23] uh fellowship with Adam and Eve. How was
[54:26] your day? How did everything go and
[54:28] stuff and all these things here until
[54:31] God comes down and say, "Adam, Adam,
[54:34] where are thou?"
[54:36] &gt;&gt; The man went to try to hide behind all
[54:40] the new knowledge that he had
[54:42] discovered. He found himself that he has
[54:44] so much knowledge. He say like, "No, no,
[54:46] no, no. I don't need to come into your
[54:47] presence anymore because I have now this
[54:50] fig leaf that I can hide myself behind.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; We don't need God anymore. We don't need
[54:55] to go to church. We don't need the
[54:56] prophet. We don't need the ministers.
[54:58] Now all the discoveries that we have, we
[55:01] can just sit with it.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Adam was sitting there and not
[55:06] understanding that what kind of
[55:08] condition he was putting himself into.
[55:11] But a God who's rich in mercy
[55:14] &gt;&gt; will first so that Adam in this
[55:16] condition that's fine it's okay I'll
[55:19] deal with you and I'll be able to bring
[55:21] you back. So now this is where God's
[55:24] condensation is coming into play into
[55:26] view that he was the uh the fountain of
[55:30] all that and then the logos that went
[55:32] out from God in the beginning become
[55:35] what we we call a theophony a
[55:37] supernatural body. God is just not like
[55:40] the air,
[55:42] &gt;&gt; but he's in a body.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Moses seen him pass and said, "Look like
[55:49] the back part of a man." And so forth.
[55:52] And then that same Theophony was made
[55:55] flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld
[55:59] him, the only begotten of the father,
[56:03] Christ. But then we see now from Genesis
[56:06] until Christ had come about, we see that
[56:09] God was appearing and uh revealing
[56:12] himself in many different forms.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; And then we wonder why would God be just
[56:18] be interested time to time to be
[56:20] appearing and to be displaying himself.
[56:23] Yeah,
[56:24] &gt;&gt; says uh live the great fountain of all
[56:27] eternity that was in spirit
[56:30] that was uh in spirit the word uh spoken
[56:34] the great fountain uh um seems like I
[56:37] repeated that quote there we can speak
[56:39] skip that we see that uh in the time of
[56:43] um uh in Genesis 14 let's go first there
[56:46] Genesis 14 and and when Abraham heard
[56:49] that his brother was taken captive on
[56:52] his strange servant born in his own
[56:54] house 380 and pursue and divided himself
[56:58] um against them and and he and his
[57:01] servant by night and smokeote them and
[57:03] pursued them unto which was on the left
[57:07] end of Damascus and verse 18 and
[57:12] Mechisedc king of Salem brought forth
[57:15] bread and wine and and he was the priest
[57:19] of the most high and he blessed him and
[57:22] said, "Blessed be Abra Abraham of the
[57:26] most high possessor of heaven and earth
[57:29] and and blessed be the most high which
[57:32] have delivered th um thine enemies into
[57:36] thy hand and gave him gave him tithes of
[57:40] all things."
[57:43] Here we are. We have now God again
[57:45] appearing to Abraham. Abraham coming
[57:48] down from uh returning from the
[57:50] slaughter of the kings he find himself
[57:53] like you know who am I dealing with it's
[57:56] like you know who is this man that comes
[57:57] to me after that I have overcome after I
[58:01] have went and to rescue Lot
[58:04] &gt;&gt; and Lot now he's finding himself in this
[58:07] meeting between Abraham and Melchisedc
[58:10] Melchisedc is standing there he's
[58:12] offering the communion and in this great
[58:15] meeting something happens to Lot
[58:17] Yeah,
[58:18] &gt;&gt; despite that they had already separated
[58:20] but something happened to Lot and Lot is
[58:24] standing there in this fellowship
[58:26] remember in God's pardon of things that
[58:28] uh when a man's come a man comes to God
[58:31] he gets baptized and he get rescued by
[58:33] the word and all these things here and
[58:36] this man starts a journey depending on
[58:39] the level that they setting themselves
[58:42] to go with the word will determine the
[58:45] eternal destination.
[58:47] So therefore Lord in this case that we
[58:49] find that Lot can only went only so far
[58:53] into receiving communion bread and wine.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing else
[59:01] was so concerning to Lot. We'll get to
[59:03] that. I know I made a statement last
[59:05] time and it seems like it was a little
[59:07] bit disrupting but God's grace will take
[59:09] time to lay it out according to the
[59:11] prophet. Now this Misedc
[59:14] and uh
[59:17] um uh 1955 and one day he was sitting
[59:21] there and the second time now we see now
[59:24] this Misedc is coming down he said again
[59:27] one day he was sitting down in the door
[59:28] of the tent under the big hook it was
[59:31] still stands in the memorial in a
[59:34] memorial today and uh it char all over
[59:36] and held and there Abraham sitting in
[59:39] the doors in his tent seisedc coming to
[59:43] him there coming to him three men
[59:46] walking and I just imagine saying
[59:50] imagine Abraham saying I've seen him
[59:53] before and he comes up and he said come
[59:56] by my lord and let fetch a little water
[1:00:00] for your feet some somehow weigh down
[1:00:03] that covenant man down in his heart knew
[1:00:06] that that was somebody more than a man
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; This misedc that uh started from the
[1:00:16] great fountain of life.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; The second time we see him on earth is a
[1:00:21] fellowshipping with Adam. When Adam
[1:00:24] falls and he comes, he steps out of the
[1:00:26] light and takes the lamp and and makes a
[1:00:29] dressing out of them.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, how God is so concerned about how
[1:00:33] people should dress.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; How himself comes down to do it. He
[1:00:39] could have chosen uh Abel to do it,
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; but he said, "No, no, no, no. I have to
[1:00:45] come down and do it myself."
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; He dressed them and let them go out of
[1:00:50] the stuff. But God was not satisfied.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Why was he not satisfied? Because he
[1:00:55] wanted to fellowship with his own. And
[1:00:57] he said like, you know, he said, "We are
[1:01:00] strangers." Said, "We've come from a
[1:01:02] foreign country. The clothes were
[1:01:04] dusty." Oh, how beautiful God is. He
[1:01:08] created the very clothes that that man
[1:01:12] Mechisedc was able to wear.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; He was not purchased from an outlet out
[1:01:18] there but himself conceptualize it
[1:01:21] because in his great mind he had
[1:01:23] everything.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Because he was the center of everything.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Anything that uh Lucifer was able to
[1:01:31] produce out there is just a shadow. It's
[1:01:33] just a provision of what God had
[1:01:36] already.
[1:01:37] No, no clothing, no way of dressing
[1:01:40] according to culture, according to this
[1:01:42] year, if it doesn't align according to
[1:01:44] God's program, it is nothing but the
[1:01:47] devil.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Despite of everything that we can call
[1:01:50] it to be,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; he said we are strangers. So the clothes
[1:01:54] were dusty. Yes,
[1:01:56] THERE WAS ALL THE WAY FROM GLORY. And so
[1:02:00] they walked up there and said, Abraham,
[1:02:03] they brought them a little stuff and
[1:02:05] washed. and Abraham begin to look at
[1:02:08] them.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Abraham is looking what what's the
[1:02:13] purpose of your visit?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; All the way from eternity to stand up
[1:02:18] here. What's the purpose of it?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; What's the purpose of the message coming
[1:02:22] down to us? What's the purpose of it?
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Then people started beholding it
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; along the years. God. Glory be to God.
[1:02:30] As I stated uh uh giving credit to voice
[1:02:34] of god and shakina and all these
[1:02:35] brothers doing all this work in order to
[1:02:39] bring forth the word unto us
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; in forms of tapes and books and stuff we
[1:02:45] standing we're looking what are we
[1:02:47] dealing with
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; what do we have this year
[1:02:52] then Abraham had now mechisedc now has
[1:02:55] to reveal the purpose of his visit every
[1:02:59] single time that The Lord comes down, he
[1:03:01] comes down for a purpose.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; And every new believer that catches the
[1:03:07] purpose of God's visitation,
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; that's his salvation.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; That's why I said that here we've seen
[1:03:13] now lot coming down to this great
[1:03:16] meeting.
[1:03:18] But his mind was only limited to the
[1:03:21] bread and wine to some physical elements
[1:03:24] that he was attracted to. Oh, now I have
[1:03:27] a freedom from all these things here. I
[1:03:29] don't smoke anymore. I don't do I don't
[1:03:31] do. No, no, no. That's not enough, Lord.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; I pray theec
[1:03:41] 2022. I pray God that every sick person
[1:03:44] in here that their faith will be
[1:03:47] sufficient this morning. Now to remember
[1:03:50] that the great that great Melchisedc
[1:03:53] back yonder who had no beginning of
[1:03:57] days.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; He never had a father nor a mother. He
[1:04:01] never had an end of life that still
[1:04:05] lives today.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; What are people are dealing with? They
[1:04:10] are dealing with the very same misedc.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; For what purpose? To dress them.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; For what purpose? to fellowship with
[1:04:19] them.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT PURPOSE? TO DWELL in them.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; OH MY. THIS GREAT MELKISEDC. See what
[1:04:26] the prophet says here. Then
[1:04:29] was incarnated
[1:04:32] called Jesus Christ
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; became flesh.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Died.
[1:04:38] WENT BACK TO again to the spirit. He
[1:04:41] He's He is still the king of peace, the
[1:04:45] king of righteousness, promising us that
[1:04:48] this great eternal things.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; It's been sold by God,
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; to Abraham that he would keep the
[1:04:57] covenant,
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; the promise brought him and his seed
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; forever. Help us today to walk forward
[1:05:07] to this platform now with undying faith.
[1:05:12] THAT THE PEOPLE COULD STAND AND look and
[1:05:14] say
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; God and more FAITH
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; WHEN I'M PICKING UP THAT BOOK GOD and
[1:05:22] more FAITH
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; WHEN I'M LISTENING TO THAT WORD GOD and
[1:05:26] more
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; faith
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; that's WHY WHEN ONE GOES ONLY WITH THE
[1:05:30] tapes
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; it's limiting God
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; when you go only with the ministers
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; you're limiting God
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; and where is the truth right IN THE
[1:05:41] MIDDLE
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OVER TIME GOD KEEPS CHANGING his
[1:05:45] forms
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; and he likes to do IT BECAUSE HE'S THERE
[1:05:49] THAT great fountain he wants to display
[1:05:52] that love through a certain form
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; then WHEN WE CHOOSE ONLY ONE PART OF
[1:05:57] THAT form then we're messing the whole
[1:06:00] program
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; and that's what denomination did it did
[1:06:03] what it limit God's work because they
[1:06:06] didn't want God to come in a certain
[1:06:08] form
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; but because of this God who's able to
[1:06:12] create any form that he wants was able
[1:06:15] to dwell in anybody that he wants.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we cannot limit God.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; But say like no no no it's not God. No,
[1:06:24] no, no. God cannot do this. No, no, no.
[1:06:26] It was not God. Then we have to take all
[1:06:29] these scriptures out of the word in
[1:06:31] order to fit that idea that we want.
[1:06:35] Because the Pharisees and Sadducees with
[1:06:38] all their knowledge thought it was
[1:06:40] important for them to conceptualize God
[1:06:43] the way they wanted to conceptualize IT.
[1:06:46] OF COURSE, THEY'VE read Moses and
[1:06:48] they've seen the Moses speaking of the
[1:06:51] pillar of fire. Of course, they knew it
[1:06:53] that way. But they didn't consider
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Melisedc
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; because when God was made flesh, he was
[1:07:00] before being coming flesh, he was first
[1:07:03] a light. And that light was with Moses
[1:07:06] in the burning bush. But the same God,
[1:07:08] it turned around, he looked and he
[1:07:10] turned to Abraham. It was a man,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; a man that would be able to eat, a man
[1:07:16] that was able to drink, a man that was
[1:07:18] able to have dust on his clothes. Yeah.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Why was he able to do that? Because he
[1:07:23] is God.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; The great fountain of spirit of
[1:07:27] surrounding himself with everything.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hebrew chapter 6. We'll find him right
[1:07:35] here meeting Abraham before that in the
[1:07:38] order of Mechisedc, a body of flesh,
[1:07:41] which was God. Sure. It was. He was God
[1:07:45] in flesh.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We cannot limit God per se
[1:07:49] because we can clearly see that you say
[1:07:53] then brother Brham why would he have to
[1:07:56] come back and be born he wasn't born yet
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; MISEDC WAS NOT BORN yet because this was
[1:08:06] a created body in full man grown man
[1:08:09] just like Adam
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; HE PARDONED HIMSELF WITH ADAM AND SAID
[1:08:13] like you know hey I need to go visit um
[1:08:19] Abraham and I'll just take a body and
[1:08:21] move along with it.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; BUT IN GOD'S PROGRAM, GOD WAS not
[1:08:25] satisfied
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; because the man has fallen. And since he
[1:08:29] has fallen now, I need to come a little
[1:08:32] closer to understand what man is going
[1:08:36] through.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:39] It's like you know having not having a
[1:08:42] child and having a child.
[1:08:45] Loving somebody's child and loving your
[1:08:48] own child. It's a different story
[1:08:50] because you know all the process that
[1:08:53] you have to go through in order to have
[1:08:56] that body that you call son. And as the
[1:08:59] sun is growing, you understand what it
[1:09:02] is to be able to take all that is in you
[1:09:07] and pouring it into your child.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Because as you are pouring that into
[1:09:13] your child, you want to see the
[1:09:15] reflection of yourself in the child.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And if the child doesn't walk according
[1:09:21] to what you are, you calling it a
[1:09:24] deception.
[1:09:26] with everything that I've done in this
[1:09:28] life to end up with a drug dealer.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Because nothing in you was a drug
[1:09:35] dealer.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; NOTHING HAS CROSSED YOUR MIND to be a a
[1:09:41] robber, a womanizer.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You say I am a man of character.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; I am respected on time.
[1:09:49] I have created all these things here.
[1:09:52] How come my child is ending up into the
[1:09:56] uh regions of the lost and has a
[1:09:58] murderer, has a liar and all these
[1:10:00] things?
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; God had to come down
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; into his son. You see, he wasn't he
[1:10:08] wasn't born then. He was just created a
[1:10:11] body that dwelt in Mechisedc was uh was
[1:10:16] the king of Salem which is the king of
[1:10:18] Jerusalem which is the king of peace.
[1:10:21] Remember the great fountain of love
[1:10:23] which is the great fountain of peace and
[1:10:25] love and everything. He is also the king
[1:10:27] of it which had neither father to mother
[1:10:30] beginning of days or ending of life.
[1:10:32] Jesus had both father and mother had a
[1:10:36] beginning of days and ending of life but
[1:10:38] he was made after the order of mechc
[1:10:43] which had no beginning of days or ending
[1:10:46] of life.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. this Jesus who is a coming forth
[1:10:51] born out of Mary the body. Then
[1:10:54] brotherham says you see Jesus I hope I
[1:10:57] have it here. Um
[1:11:07] when Jesus was born a siran church age.
[1:11:10] Oh how striking it is. Jehovah born
[1:11:15] crying over a man pile.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Jehovah born in a manger of straw.
[1:11:20] Jehovah there is your everlasting sign.
[1:11:23] The the to the proud and the puffed up
[1:11:26] the poed
[1:11:29] intellects and that have that have
[1:11:31] evolved their own theology and denied
[1:11:34] the truth of God. Jehovah God a crying
[1:11:37] baby in a sticking bond.
[1:11:40] Yeah.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; This great fountain of love
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; comes down the same way that he created
[1:11:47] a son at the beginning to make the
[1:11:49] creation. He comes again. He creates
[1:11:52] another body in whom to fulfill a
[1:11:56] different part of his great segment.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Then that's this great Jehovah being
[1:12:03] born in a barn. When the magi comes two
[1:12:06] years down the road, they look at the
[1:12:08] man, they say like, you know, who is
[1:12:10] this? That's Jehovah.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; How's that possible?
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; How is that possible that you know this
[1:12:17] is to be Jehovah?
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN GOD COME AND AND SAY LIKE, YOU
[1:12:22] KNOW, this is the king of the the Jews?
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; WHILE THEY made all their ideas,
[1:12:31] GOD can only be so much. God can only do
[1:12:35] so far.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; GOD CAN ONLY BE CONTAINED IN THIS FORM.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT THERE IS YOUR EVERLASTING
[1:12:42] SIGN.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; HE'S STANDING THERE IN the midst of you
[1:12:45] all. He created a cell. He created
[1:12:48] everything and then came unto Mary and
[1:12:52] put the word in Mary. And as Mary is
[1:12:55] looking, everything that is growing
[1:12:57] within her has is not a procedure of her
[1:13:01] own ability.
[1:13:03] is not a remarkable understanding of his
[1:13:06] own of her own
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; but only thing that he she had to do was
[1:13:11] to believe
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; I'm showing us that God is coming down
[1:13:15] in all these forms
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; HE'S SHOWING US TYPES OF types that I am
[1:13:22] able to dwell among you
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; in the simplicity of faith
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; to fulfill what I have to fulfill
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; but then as I am fulfilling All these
[1:13:33] things it's only limited to my program.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus will be born. Mechisedc will come
[1:13:40] about but only to fulfill a segment of
[1:13:44] my program.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Not two persons. I don't need anybody
[1:13:52] helps. I'll do it myself
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; because I've conceptualized it
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; and I'll come down and fulfill it. How
[1:14:00] striking God did he deny the truth? Then
[1:14:02] we then we think we have a right to be
[1:14:05] proud, holding up our noses, criticizing
[1:14:08] and acting as though we were somebody.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; He's your real sign.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; This is the right one. Jehovah playing
[1:14:16] as a boy.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; IMAGINE THOSE people looking at the
[1:14:22] child, a six-year-old boy playing there.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; They tell them that's the creator of
[1:14:27] heaven and earth. Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; What do you mean playing like that? It's
[1:14:33] impossible.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THEY CONCEPTUALIZED IT.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; BUT NEVERTHELESS, ALL THESE THINGS, GOD
[1:14:40] WAS SHOWING IT TYPE AFTER TYPE AND
[1:14:43] SHADOW AFTER SHADOW.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; HE TOLD SAMUEL, "I AM THE REJECTED KING.
[1:14:49] HOW COME I AM THE ONE PREACHING THE
[1:14:51] WORD?" NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, SAMUEL.
[1:14:54] It's not you.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; It's Misedc that is being rejected.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; This is the real one. Jehovah playing as
[1:15:05] a boy. JEHOVAH WORKING IN A CARPENTER'S
[1:15:09] CHAR SHOP.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Jehovah washing the feet of fishermen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Along all these years what people are
[1:15:18] beholding.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Brother says that it's so simple.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. AMEN.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; THAT PEOPLE can't just understand it.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And that's the very challenge that we
[1:15:34] have today.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; In the simplicity of words,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; people are looking and say like, you
[1:15:42] know, no, no, no, no, maybe not that
[1:15:43] way. Maybe we don't need it that that
[1:15:45] that much.
[1:15:48] Hebrew chapter 7, uh, verse uh, Proverbs
[1:15:51] 21. Now he was the king of
[1:15:54] righteousness, the king of Jerusalem,
[1:15:56] the king of uh of of righteousness, the
[1:15:58] king of peace. Jesus was called the
[1:16:01] prince of peace and the prince is the
[1:16:04] son of a king. So this man Mechisedc was
[1:16:09] king of peace. Then he would have to be
[1:16:14] the father of the prince of peace.
[1:16:21] Now they are looking this great mystery
[1:16:25] of God himself unfolding
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; that Mechisedc BEING THE FATHER HOW IS
[1:16:31] THAT POSSIBLE that's the great the great
[1:16:34] mystery of Jesus Christ whereby like you
[1:16:36] know some say like you know Joseph was
[1:16:38] his father
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; according to the worldly understanding
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; some SAY WELL GOD WAS HIS FATHER.
[1:16:48] Then another says the Holy Spirit is his
[1:16:51] father. That who is his father?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE VERY SAME PERSON.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; WHY? Only the only thing is he's only
[1:17:00] changing forms.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE JUST HAVE HARD time following
[1:17:05] the spirit as he's changing the forms.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And they want to limit in which form God
[1:17:12] is able to work in. Right.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, if I'm a Jew, oh, I only want to see
[1:17:18] him as a light.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Because that's what Moses told us.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; That your Lord is light. That's what
[1:17:26] crossed them in the in the uh in the in
[1:17:29] the Red Sea. It was light.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Then now when he changes and becomes a
[1:17:34] man, it is a troublesome time.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; They can't comprehend it.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And brother Renham says uh Mighty
[1:17:45] Conqueror 95. When he was in heaven, he
[1:17:49] was the logos that went out of God in
[1:17:51] the beginning. And he came down on earth
[1:17:53] and was he was not to be made an angel.
[1:17:57] He came down on earth and took the form
[1:18:00] of bondsman. Not an angel. Not somebody
[1:18:04] of a great stature. He came down on
[1:18:07] earth and took the form of bonesmen. Not
[1:18:09] an angel. not not come down in the great
[1:18:12] in down in the great Jehovah glory.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; He was not seen of a great statue.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; But he was Jehovah. But in the forms
[1:18:22] that is coming in is so simple.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; They were expecting that you know the
[1:18:28] glory of God where God was creating
[1:18:31] thunders and trees coming out and stuff
[1:18:35] but he was still able to come down so
[1:18:38] lowly. Yes.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Walking in.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, who are you? I am John. Who are you?
[1:18:47] I am Peter. Who are you? Oh, okay. Yeah.
[1:18:51] He's playing there doing everything just
[1:18:54] like everybody was doing and stuff. In
[1:18:57] Luke 2:46,
[1:18:58] and it came to pass that after 3 days,
[1:19:01] they found him in the temple. Uh uh
[1:19:04] Joseph and Mary and Mary had lost Jesus.
[1:19:07] And Jesus is growing just like uh
[1:19:09] Jehovah is growing, sitting in the midst
[1:19:11] of the doctors, both hearing them and
[1:19:14] asking asking them questions. And uh all
[1:19:18] that heard him were astonished at his
[1:19:21] understanding and answers. And when they
[1:19:24] saw him, they were amazed. And his
[1:19:27] mother said unto him, "Son,
[1:19:29] you born out of me. You are my son. You
[1:19:33] have to listen to what I tell you. Where
[1:19:35] I go as a parent, you need to listen to
[1:19:38] me.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Why has thou dust dealt with us? Behold,
[1:19:43] thy father and I, your mother sought
[1:19:48] thee sorrowing. We were crying. We had
[1:19:51] you all over the news.
[1:19:54] That's the understanding of who he was,
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; right? And he said unto her to them, how
[1:20:03] is it that ye sought me?
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; How is it that ye sought me? Was ye not
[1:20:12] ye not that I must be about my father's
[1:20:16] business? Amen.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; The great spirit is coming down,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; not for me to become your family member,
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; your church member,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; to be found as your husband,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; as your brother, but I'm I'm here for a
[1:20:38] specific purpose
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; with Abraham. I came down to give him
[1:20:46] bread and wine.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; When Abraham saw me again, I gave him
[1:20:52] the circumcision.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; When he saw me again, I gave I came to
[1:20:57] give him the promise of a son.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; When I came down again, I CAME TO TELL
[1:21:02] HIM about the destru upcoming
[1:21:04] destruction of Sodom.
[1:21:07] AMEN.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; BUT MARY and Joseph now turn all that
[1:21:12] program into you are my son.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; You born into my family.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; You need to listen to me, your father
[1:21:21] and I. How that you are looking for me.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; We turn the word today into a geographic
[1:21:32] locations appropriation.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:36] OH, THE WORD CAME FIRST FOR THESE
[1:21:39] PEOPLE. So therefore, you people here
[1:21:41] cannot understand it.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU MISSING GOD'S great program
[1:21:50] coming down fulfilling and unfolding?
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; And if we miss that also today, we are
[1:21:58] also just desperate just as Lot was.
[1:22:06] Because Lot also believed.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Because Mary also believed.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; The visitation of the angel.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You shall have a son. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
[1:22:17] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. But
[1:22:20] then WHEN THE CHILD IS BORN, now we're
[1:22:22] turning it into our only fleshly
[1:22:25] understanding.
[1:22:27] Uhhuh.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; And they understood not the saying which
[1:22:34] he spoke unto them. And he went down
[1:22:36] with them and came to Nazare Nazareth
[1:22:40] and subject unto and was subject unto
[1:22:43] them, you know, organizations mindset.
[1:22:47] But his mother kept all these saying in
[1:22:49] in her heart. And Jesus increased in
[1:22:53] wisdom and stature and in favor with God
[1:22:57] and men.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; This Jehovah
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; who was a comforter who was a child
[1:23:04] playing born in a sticking born here
[1:23:08] come now he's growing up. And in John 1
[1:23:11] 29 when now Jesus grows this great
[1:23:14] Jehovah fulfilling the purpose where
[1:23:16] unto he was called the father's
[1:23:18] business. The next day John seeth Jesus
[1:23:21] coming unto him and said, "Behold the
[1:23:23] lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[1:23:26] the world."
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; But we know him.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THIS IS JOSEPH'S SON.
[1:23:36] OH, it's a family mother. Oh, JON IS HIS
[1:23:39] SECOND COUSIN.
[1:23:42] OH, it's now they're making it. Oh, look
[1:23:46] at these people.
[1:23:49] The same spirit yesterday,
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; the same spirits today
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; because they were able to behold the
[1:23:56] word.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; They could touch it. They could play
[1:24:00] with it. But then when the word becomes
[1:24:03] now to be made manifest or in other
[1:24:05] words, the word comes into action
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; they're still looking at it as a Mary's
[1:24:14] son.
[1:24:17] But it was God. It was Jehovah.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE GREAT FOUNTAIN OF EVERYTHING.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Comes down brother. Uh the Bible says
[1:24:25] here this is he of whom I said after he
[1:24:29] after me cometh a man which is preferred
[1:24:32] before me for he was before me.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; This is of whom I said after me cometh a
[1:24:39] man which is preferred before me. before
[1:24:43] he was before me.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; John is taking the time to teach them
[1:24:50] the word.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Look, the one that you are dealing with,
[1:24:56] it's not just what you know playing in
[1:24:59] the yard
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; as a carpenter
[1:25:03] who has a who when he's hungry you feed
[1:25:06] him food and everything,
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; but you are dealing with a different
[1:25:10] type. of ministry at this time.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; And John bear record um before me. 31.
[1:25:21] And I knew him not, but that he should
[1:25:24] be made manifest to Israel. Therefore, I
[1:25:27] am come baptizing with water. And John
[1:25:30] Ben bear record saying, I saw the spirit
[1:25:34] descending from heaven. Remember,
[1:25:37] descending from heaven is not a up and
[1:25:39] down movement. It is a taking form,
[1:25:43] taking shape, going into action
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; because those who have went up with the
[1:25:51] uh rockets and everything didn't get to
[1:25:53] it. And when they went out there, they
[1:25:55] told them that you left it behind here.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And this great Jehovah
[1:26:02] coming in to the sun, in other words, is
[1:26:06] now I'm starting the ministry.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:09] Because in the Old Testament, NO MAN
[1:26:12] COULD COME into the priesthood until
[1:26:15] he's 30 years old.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, NOW GOD NOW IS ACTIVATING THE
[1:26:22] VERY SAME PART OF himself
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; into THIS SON WHO WAS CALLED FOR A
[1:26:29] SPECIFIC purpose which was to die for
[1:26:32] the sins of the world. Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; With Mechisedc, we see everything that
[1:26:38] he did with Abraham. With Jesus, we see
[1:26:42] everything that he's doing with him.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; But he doesn't limit himself there.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And John bear record saying that I saw
[1:26:54] the spirit descending from heaven like a
[1:26:57] dove and it abode upon him and I knew
[1:27:00] him not. But he that sent me to baptize
[1:27:04] with water, the same said unto me, upon
[1:27:07] whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:27:09] descending, and remaining on him, the
[1:27:14] same is he which baptizes with uh uh
[1:27:18] baptize with the Holy Spirit, with the
[1:27:21] Holy Ghost, and so and bear record that
[1:27:24] this is the son of God.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:30] This is
[1:27:32] the place.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Where God
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; is coming to do the work.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PLACE THAT God is doing this
[1:27:44] specific work.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; AND EVERY SINGLE TIME, THAT'S WHY IT IS
[1:27:49] IMPORTANT before we get into Jeremiah's
[1:27:51] ministry
[1:27:53] that we see this condensation of God.
[1:27:57] this God are coming down and morphing
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; so THAT WE KNOW WHAT TYPE OF WORK IS
[1:28:04] ALLOTTED TO him again today.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Because Baram says like you know after
[1:28:10] his death and resurrection he says like
[1:28:12] you know I'll tell you what the world
[1:28:14] knows little about about his work after
[1:28:17] his resurrection. He said like you know
[1:28:19] people talk about him he died and he
[1:28:21] resurrected and all these things here
[1:28:23] but what he did afterward people know
[1:28:25] nothing about in his theophony when he
[1:28:29] he resurrected he had a specific work to
[1:28:31] do in his theophony when he went into
[1:28:34] the regions of the loss he had a
[1:28:36] specific work to do
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; who is that the great mechisedc who was
[1:28:41] that the great fountain OF LOVE WHO IS
[1:28:43] that the great Jehovah
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; and this great Jehovah is coming down
[1:28:49] one step at a time.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And as he's displaying himself
[1:28:55] is not for you to turn him into
[1:28:58] your church member,
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; into your religion,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; into sets of of orders and all these
[1:29:07] things here. No, no, no, no.
[1:29:09] He is concerned
[1:29:12] about his child who was fallen by
[1:29:15] representation
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; and he has to bring him back again
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; and has is coming down. In other word
[1:29:23] has is changing forms. In other words,
[1:29:26] as is taking edge after age. Let's just
[1:29:29] read this so we can close.
[1:29:43] Hebrews chapter 7
[1:29:45] and in there we find out that he had
[1:29:49] seven variety of spirits.
[1:29:53] Is that right? The Bible says in
[1:29:55] revelation that seven spirits before the
[1:29:58] throne of God. Is that right? The seven
[1:30:01] manifold seven spirit. We find out that
[1:30:05] there is a seven colors.
[1:30:08] There is seven church ages there and all
[1:30:12] just uh oh it just runs.
[1:30:15] Seven is complete and God was complete.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; And seven spirit and those spirits were
[1:30:24] perfect.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; The first was the color of red. perfect
[1:30:28] love, redemption, or how if we had time
[1:30:32] to give those colors a show of each one
[1:30:35] of those colors representing represents
[1:30:38] God's purity. Amen. Those colors, there
[1:30:41] were seven colors. Those colors
[1:30:44] represent the period of God. And those
[1:30:46] colors represent represents the motives
[1:30:50] of God.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] in his way of displaying himself the
[1:30:58] great fountain of love. He said like you
[1:31:01] know in each of all these cows
[1:31:04] these are my motives
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; because I came down and I died and I
[1:31:09] resurrected and all these things here.
[1:31:11] Now see now the other part of me coming
[1:31:14] into view.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THOSE PART OF YOU that we need
[1:31:21] to see? It comes down. It gives you
[1:31:23] types and shadows and and symbols. It
[1:31:26] gives you seven colors.
[1:31:29] Oh, each color will display something
[1:31:33] out of it.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, each color is representing God's
[1:31:38] motive.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, this color is showing every stage
[1:31:42] that he's taking the believer back to
[1:31:45] unity with him. Amen.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; SO THEREFORE, EVERY SINGLE believer
[1:31:52] that comes around, remember, that's why
[1:31:55] I spoke about Lot. You come along under
[1:31:59] the first color, you accept,
[1:32:02] under the red light of redemption.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; You agree with it, but it's not enough.
[1:32:10] That's why I was able to say that Lot
[1:32:12] was saved.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Sure. because it came down under the
[1:32:17] blood at that time but it didn't go all
[1:32:21] the way to the end.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; We'll take more time to break that into
[1:32:25] more details.
[1:32:27] THIS GREAT FOUNTAIN OF LOVE is
[1:32:30] displaying his motives.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And this motives we see he says brother
[1:32:35] gives us the hint. He say you see the
[1:32:37] light you see out of that diamond you
[1:32:41] the reflection of the light he gives you
[1:32:43] seven colors and those seven colors out
[1:32:46] of the red is redemption. Yeah.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Then you have every other color that
[1:32:51] comes after it which is displaying
[1:32:54] specifically what he wants to do in that
[1:32:57] certain age. Now we see that out of
[1:33:00] those ages. Now we see those cycles
[1:33:02] repeating in itself
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; because the cycles that uh uh as uh uh
[1:33:11] Jesus was giving the parable of of the
[1:33:14] swer those who work in the first in the
[1:33:17] first um the first hour they came they
[1:33:19] planted and they got the reward.
[1:33:22] the second hour, the third, and all the
[1:33:25] way to the last one. They looked and
[1:33:26] they said, "How come we have labored
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; all these years,
[1:33:34] but they at the end are receiving the
[1:33:37] same reward
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; as us at the end."
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "But we agree with you the way
[1:33:45] I should pay you forward."
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
[1:33:50] THAT. HOW COME PEOPLE AT THE END of all
[1:33:53] this time are able to receive the
[1:33:56] recompense of every other age?
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Because I am Jehovah.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; I cannot at the end of everything keep
[1:34:07] still hiding myself.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; I have to unveil myself fully unto
[1:34:12] people.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:34:16] And that is that's why I had to take the
[1:34:19] time first to lay down these things so
[1:34:21] that Jeremiah's ministry
[1:34:25] is not seen and be heard
[1:34:28] looked at as the way the Pharisees the
[1:34:31] Pharisees uh the the Pharisees and Mary
[1:34:34] and Joseph looked at him right
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; oh
[1:34:40] yes I paid you what you're supposed to
[1:34:42] have but in this cycle of the last hour
[1:34:47] everything comes back in repetition in
[1:34:49] between.
[1:34:52] And in that last cycle we see NOW THAT
[1:34:55] ALL THESE OTHER FIRST CYCLES, first
[1:34:57] ages, second ages AND STUFF, ALL THEIR
[1:35:00] BENEFIT, we are finding it under the
[1:35:03] last age.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; And as we are finding it in the last
[1:35:07] age, the same way that the great Jehovah
[1:35:10] we read it says he is here fully.
[1:35:14] Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Brother say that they are looking for
[1:35:20] him but he say he has already returned.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; I'll bring the court. I'm getting ahead
[1:35:26] of myself. But we see that this great
[1:35:29] light is coming down.
[1:35:33] In other words is I come in this age. I
[1:35:36] do a specific work.
[1:35:39] And if we look at God's pattern of the
[1:35:42] Bible, we know that every single age
[1:35:45] that we are living in, those cycles
[1:35:48] repeat itself.
