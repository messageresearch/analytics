[33:29] if you'll turn the mics up for Justin
[33:31] and Sister Gill. just a fourline song
[33:34] and it's it's a prayer song. It says
[33:36] just to be close to you. They just song
[33:39] about a
[33:40] king that's known about love and mercy

[36:06] everyone. It's good to have our pastor

[36:17] here today. Any other guests and
[36:19] visitors? We welcome you this
[36:21] morning. Why should I worry? Why should
[36:24] I fear when the very same Jesus is
[36:27] always near? Amen. Don't worry. Amen.
[36:34] He said, "Don't worry, little bride.
[36:38] Don't worry little
[36:40] bride. I'm a way maker. What's your need

[36:55] your whole heart. Don't fear, but trust
[36:57] in the Lord. Let's sing it this morning.
[37:00] Out on the
[37:02] waters, a storm raging
[37:05] high. waters around them were trled that
[37:12] night. Fear filled their
[37:15] hearts. They felt they would
[37:18] die. They failed to
[37:21] remember the master was not. And he
[37:26] spoke the words and the wind stood
[37:30] still.
[37:32] Even the
[37:33] [Music]
[37:34] walkers make his
[37:37] will. He called their
[37:40] soul like he will find if I just
[37:46] remember he lives deep
[37:49] inside. And why should I work free? Why
[37:54] should I fear when the Mary St.
[37:59] Jesus saves always dear. He lives in my
[38:05] heart and hears when I
[38:08] cry. I'll call on the man till the storm
[38:13] passes by and we read in the Bible when
[38:18] he
[38:20] walk. Brought light to the darkness when
[38:24] the way grew so dim. How great it would
[38:29] be to have his footsteps in
[38:33] mind. A walk with the
[38:36] master all of the time. And when trials
[38:42] come and death seems to not, I'll call
[38:46] on the master. I know I get there on
[38:52] time. Sing these songs and my bodies.
[38:57] All you got to do, all you have to do is
[39:01] call on his
[39:06] name. Welcome back.
[39:09] I with the very same Jesus. He stays
[39:15] always near. He lives in my heart.
[39:21] I
[39:22] cry. The Lord
[39:25] is storm passes by.
[39:31] Hallelujah.
[39:33] Amen.
[39:35] God bless you all this morning. I greet
[39:38] you in the lovely name of Jesus.
[39:42] Amen. It's good to just see all your
[39:46] smiling faces be home together with you.
[39:49] God bless you. You can be seated for
[39:50] just a
[39:52] moment. Give you a little bit of a
[39:54] report
[39:56] uh about South
[39:58] Africa and also to to brother Roberts
[40:02] already said it. God bless you mothers
[40:04] on this being Mother's Day. We honor
[40:07] you. When our government doesn't even
[40:10] know the definition of mother, we do.
[40:13] Thank you, Lord. And we we give honor
[40:16] and respect to all of our mothers,
[40:18] realizing what a great Yeah. Let's give
[40:21] them a
[40:28] hand. After the service, we've got a
[40:31] small token we'd like to share with the
[40:34] mothers. So after service there. Amen.
[40:37] Praise the Lord. Amen. All right. Like
[40:39] to give you a little bit of a missionary
[40:41] report. I usually uh don't do much of
[40:45] giving a report when I go overseas. And
[40:48] sometimes people say, "Well, Brother
[40:49] Ron, you know, um I don't like to draw
[40:52] attention to myself. I realize God does
[40:55] use us uh when we're over there and and
[40:58] uh everything. I would rather have
[41:01] somebody else give the report than
[41:03] myself. But we certainly had a a lovely
[41:06] time over there. Uh and the very reason
[41:09] that I went this year was that 33 years
[41:13] ago I dedicated the church in Rand
[41:16] Fontaine, the addition of the church and
[41:20] u they were having their 50th jubilee.
[41:24] Brother Harold Hildebrandt uh had been
[41:26] the original pastor to dedicate the
[41:29] first church. Brother Joseph Daniels was
[41:33] the pastor at that time who had it on
[41:36] his heart to start a work there in Rand
[41:38] Fontaine. And so, uh, we went over there
[41:41] for their 50th jubilee to to celebrate
[41:45] with them. And, uh, they had asked me to
[41:48] come because normally I try to stay at
[41:50] home during the Easter time. Uh, but
[41:53] anyway, we were over there and my wife,
[41:55] Sister Sandy, went with me. Praise the
[41:58] Lord. I appreciate it. She helps me out
[42:00] quite a bit and um everything. And so
[42:06] um let's see
[42:09] here. Yeah. Um after brother Harold
[42:13] Hildebrandt had originally dedicated the
[42:15] church, the church began to grow as
[42:18] every church does. I feel even within my
[42:22] own ministry, if I had a ministry that
[42:25] didn't show forth fruit unto the glory
[42:29] of God and bringing new converts, I
[42:33] would think there's something wrong with
[42:34] my ministry. And so, I thank God that we
[42:37] see births and people coming to the
[42:40] church and people getting baptized. And
[42:42] so after 17 years um they had to put on
[42:47] a new addition on the church, a new
[42:49] sanctuary. And so uh 33 years ago I went
[42:54] ahead and dedicated that um for them.
[42:57] And I had a picture, I don't think I
[43:00] included it, um but it showed a picture
[43:03] a bunch of the old-timers alto together.
[43:05] And I was just a young guy then, but
[43:08] they're all now old-timers. And oh yeah,
[43:10] they they got it. They got it. Yeah. You
[43:13] guys recognize the one on the left
[43:16] front? That's Stafford Massiey's father.
[43:19] That's John Massie. And Sister Zoe's
[43:22] father's on the far right there. Brother
[43:26] Sergeant. And uh Joseph Daniels is right
[43:29] behind me. And the rest of the brothers,
[43:34] I don't remember their names, but
[43:37] uh yeah, there it was 33 years ago.
[43:42] And
[43:43] uh you know, saints of God, what you do
[43:45] is you go and you preach the gospel and
[43:47] you sew the seed
[43:50] and then years later you see the
[43:51] fruition of that seed being sown and and
[43:54] you thank God. You don't think you're an
[43:56] elder to you uh look back on in time and
[44:00] you see, wow, I've been there, done
[44:03] that. And uh we had three days of
[44:06] services, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[44:09] Now, my wife and I left the house or the
[44:12] guest house at about 8:30 in the
[44:14] morning. Did not return to the guest
[44:16] house at at 9:00 till 9:00 at night. And
[44:21] uh that's rough on an old guy. It's
[44:24] rough on a young guy, but it's
[44:26] especially old uh hard on an old guy.
[44:29] And and I told Sandy, if I ever do
[44:32] something like that again, they're going
[44:34] to have to take me back and let me have
[44:37] a midday snooze.
[44:39] and and relax a little bit and then go
[44:42] back to service because your song
[44:44] service can be uh two two and a half
[44:46] hours, you know, and and uh because they
[44:48] love to worship over there. And uh I
[44:51] think I must have some some African
[44:54] blood in me somewhere because I do enjoy
[44:58] uh getting with them and worshiping and
[45:00] and uh cuz they're not inhibited. We
[45:04] are, you know, we just, you know, can't
[45:06] even move and we're fossilized and
[45:09] everything. See? So, but I enjoy it over
[45:12] there with them. We had u So, I spoke
[45:15] the first service on Friday and then I
[45:19] spoke uh on Saturday, a youth service in
[45:23] between services and then we had I had
[45:27] the last service on Sunday. So I was the
[45:31] alpha and the omega of the meetings. Um
[45:35] and uh so we just had a lovely time. The
[45:38] the other guest speaker was brother
[45:40] Maxwell Lee who is from Guyana. I had
[45:44] never met him before but we had a nice
[45:46] time with him. He seemed to have a good
[45:48] um revelation of the word and we were
[45:50] blessed by his ministry also.
[45:53] Um, so,
[45:56] uh, also while we were there, the you
[46:00] little
[46:01] trivia, excuse me, little trivia things.
[46:05] Um, after the first night or two, uh,
[46:08] our hot water tank went out. So, for two
[46:12] days, we didn't have hot water.
[46:15] So, you come from after the meeting is
[46:17] you're, you know, you're all hot and
[46:19] sweaty. You want to change clothes, have
[46:20] a nice shower, and then go to bed. Well,
[46:22] we didn't have that. And um after two
[46:26] days, we had it fixed. And Sandy could
[46:30] hear me in the shower praising God and
[46:32] and just thanking God. Listen, you don't
[46:34] know how nice it is to have a hot shower
[46:37] until you haven't had one for a couple
[46:39] days. So, I was just rejoicing in the
[46:42] shower and thanking God for hot water.
[46:46] Amen. Um, then the following Sunday, I
[46:49] preached for brother Brian
[46:51] Naidu and they're at his church and we
[46:54] had a wonderful time. I do have some
[46:56] photos here for you and a couple video
[46:59] clips here to to try to go along. So,
[47:02] uh, when we got to the airport, uh, I
[47:04] did not expect to see brother Kevin Milm
[47:07] and the other brothers there. Uh, uh,
[47:10] you have brother, uh,
[47:13] Beastman, Johan Beastman on the left,
[47:16] Sandy and I, and then brother Quibbis,
[47:19] uh,
[47:20] Robertson, and then Kevin Milm. and they
[47:24] weren't supposed to be there to pick us
[47:25] up, but they were there saying goodbye
[47:28] to brother uh Quibbus' brother who was
[47:32] had been visiting them. Anyway, when we
[47:34] come out and here we see them and I
[47:36] said, "Are you guys supposed to be
[47:37] picking me up? What's the deal?" Anyway,
[47:40] uh Brother Benny uh from Brother Rubin's
[47:43] church uh had come down, Ruben's son
[47:47] came down, and he even had some cups of
[47:49] coffee for me. That's nice. get off a
[47:51] 17-hour flight or 14-hour flight and
[47:54] have coffee. You need coffee, let me
[47:56] tell you. It just kind of stimulates you
[47:58] and wake you up a little bit, you know.
[48:00] And um so
[48:03] um okay, what's the next one here? Now,
[48:06] here is brother Ruben Daniels. He's been
[48:08] the the pastor. That's his wife on the
[48:11] left. And uh that's sister Wendy and
[48:14] Sandy and I. Sorry, the light was in the
[48:16] back coming through. And and you it's a
[48:19] little haze there. There I am with
[48:21] brother Ruben. He's had pancreatic
[48:24] cancer, had surgery, and he's just now
[48:29] recovering. And um so we were there,
[48:32] went and prayed for him. Go
[48:34] ahead. And this is inside the church of
[48:37] Ran Fontaine. Uh that's looking to the
[48:41] left. That's the front view. And then
[48:42] you'll have a right side view there of a
[48:45] little bit of the overflow and some of
[48:46] the ministers and their wives sitting
[48:48] there. And um there's brother Charnneck
[48:52] in the the light tan suit
[48:55] there. There's a picture of brother
[48:58] Joseph Daniels and I in front of a big
[49:00] placard they had 50th year anniversary
[49:03] Jubilee. And
[49:07] uh here is one of the song. Oh, excuse
[49:10] me. That's brother Maxwell Lee from
[49:13] Guyana.
[49:15] So now this brother
[49:20] Um, you know what, brother Robert? I
[49:22] left my glasses. Get the the brown
[49:25] rimmed ones there. Uh, brother,
[49:29] I can't read it.
[49:31] Fidil Fidila.
[49:34] Fidel.
[49:37] Uh,
[49:39] Mulaja Benin.
[49:42] Fidel. Moolaja Benin. Anyway, he is the
[49:47] ambassador of
[49:49] Congo to South Africa
[49:53] and he was there with a bodyguard and
[49:55] chauffeur and everything. Thank you.
[49:58] Yeah. Excuse me, brother
[50:00] Robert. Can't see, can't
[50:04] hold. And uh so what's what's very
[50:08] interesting um there now he says,
[50:11] "Brother Ron, we stream your services.
[50:13] we have been for years and everything.
[50:15] He is a believer and uh uh they're from
[50:19] the Congo. And he said, "I was raised up
[50:22] with a very very uh poor family. My
[50:26] mother sold vegetables on the corner uh
[50:28] to make ends meet. They had another poor
[50:31] family that moved in with them. The
[50:33] little six-year-old boy that was there
[50:35] with them that had grew up with them
[50:38] together is now president of Congo.
[50:42] So when that little boy became president
[50:44] of K Congo, now he's not a little boy
[50:46] anymore. He's a he's an older man, you
[50:48] know, but uh when he became president,
[50:51] he made him ambassador. Wow. And so from
[50:55] rags to riches right away and and
[50:57] everything, but a very very finite uh
[51:00] nice man, Brother
[51:03] Fidel. Yeah. Here's some of the
[51:05] ministers there and their wives behind
[51:08] them. every behind every good man's a
[51:10] better woman.
[51:14] Yes, there is brother uh Dale Adams from
[51:18] Cape Town and his wife. We're on the
[51:20] front row there. And I just took a
[51:22] little selfie real quick there.
[51:25] And this is Sister Perfect's father. And
[51:29] I'll I have a picture of uh the family a
[51:32] little bit later. He's one of the elders
[51:35] there. Been with him many years. There
[51:36] is uh Stafford Massiey's parents, John
[51:40] and Miranda. Of course, you know them.
[51:42] They they lived here with us for a while
[51:44] and went to this
[51:46] church. This is brother Owen Palm on the
[51:49] right and his son, his family. And u uh
[51:53] one of the guest ministers there and I
[51:55] had a picture of he and his family. The
[51:57] man on the left is his son and he just
[51:59] became a professional golfer um there in
[52:03] South Africa. And during my preaching, I
[52:07] said, "I haven't come here to find a
[52:09] golfing partner. I haven't come here
[52:11] this and that." And he he met me
[52:13] afterwards and he said, "Brother Ron, I
[52:15] was going to ask you to go golfing, you
[52:19] know." Okay. So, here are the some of
[52:22] the ministers
[52:26] wives. Then you have the ministers here.
[52:29] Just a lovely time with the brethren
[52:31] there. Uh many of them I had not seen in
[52:33] many years. So it was quite a
[52:37] blessing. This is uh Sister
[52:40] Perfect's parents and her sister. Can
[52:43] doesn't her sister look like her? Huh?
[52:46] Yeah, it does a little bit. Stand up. We
[52:48] want to know who your parents are. Stand
[52:50] up here. Since perfect. Yeah. Smile real
[52:53] big. There you go.
[52:55] [Applause]
[53:02] And Sister Zoe, she's from this
[53:05] church and um you know, everybody said,
[53:08] "How's sister Zoe doing? How come she's
[53:10] not singing more song specials?" She
[53:12] sang lots of song specials with us. I
[53:14] say, "I'm going to get on her case when
[53:16] I get back." Uh she was a very integral
[53:19] part. Uh she was a real worker over
[53:21] there and so they miss her greatly.
[53:25] All right. And this is us as we had
[53:28] prayed for brother Ruben and that's his
[53:32] daughter and son-in-law and his wife and
[53:34] Sandy and I and Kevin and Mary
[53:39] Milo. John Andy's was there. He was
[53:42] speaking for brother Madiva who is the
[53:45] brother to his right. Uh going down the
[53:48] table and then you have brother Paul
[53:50] from uh Emanuel Gospel Center, Sandy and
[53:53] I, Kevin and Mary. And then you have
[53:55] Brian Jones's son, Jonathan Jones, and
[53:58] his wife. And then the the kids are at
[54:01] the far end
[54:03] there. And uh as we were leaving that
[54:07] day here, we met Dale Adams on the right
[54:10] and Paul Hlet was over there speaking
[54:12] for their Easter convention. So it was
[54:15] uh it was nice to see them. We took a
[54:18] photo and then they had us over for
[54:21] dinner. uh Johan Beastman and his uh
[54:24] wife Sister Goodran. And this is all of
[54:27] them together. And this is the daughter
[54:30] of Gideon and Kathy Ratif and um and
[54:34] their children and stuff. So anyway,
[54:37] it's we had a just a lovely meal. Now
[54:40] this I took this picture here because
[54:42] this is interesting. Back in 2008, if
[54:44] you see in the top left corner, you
[54:47] remember I used to uh uh Sister Tenie,
[54:49] remember we took them out here and we
[54:51] rode around in the little arena? Well, I
[54:53] took the three girls and put them on my
[54:55] horse and I led them around the arena
[54:58] and she the little girl became
[55:02] absolutely mesmerized by
[55:05] horses. And so she wanted to recreate
[55:08] the photo in South Africa.
[55:11] So, she loaned me her black hat and she
[55:14] got on her horse and I led her horse
[55:16] around. And so, the the top photos 2008
[55:20] and the bottom one's in 2025. Now, she
[55:23] is a jumper. She has a horse that jumps
[55:26] over the stuff and she's a just a
[55:28] tremendous rider.
[55:32] Anyway, we went ahead and um here is
[55:36] brother Tim Dodd and his wife Sarah. He
[55:40] has moved from Cloverdale to South
[55:44] Africa as an interimm pastor until they
[55:47] get the new pastor voted in. And so he's
[55:51] over there helping them out. And uh uh
[55:55] quite a a move for them. Here's brother
[55:57] Brian Jones, his wife, sister Crystal,
[56:00] and Brian Naidu. What did I say? Yeah,
[56:04] Brian Naidu and his wife Crystal. And uh
[56:09] this is in his church. This is the last
[56:12] Sunday. And so he was doing some of the
[56:15] introduction and song leading and and so
[56:18] just couple views. I take it right,
[56:20] center,
[56:27] left. And then it's uh Marcus Becker was
[56:30] over there. And uh so yeah, all these
[56:34] people from all over the world are
[56:36] there, you know, they all come to see me
[56:38] and I just couldn't believe it. No, they
[56:41] were there preaching their own uh deals,
[56:42] but Tim Dodd was there. Brother David
[56:44] Gonzalez was one of the pastors at the
[56:46] table there. Anyway, here we are uh with
[56:49] Brian Naidu and Crystal. And uh this is
[56:53] Hannes Vanwick and his wife just uh in
[56:57] the center of the photo there. He is
[56:58] also a pastor there in the Johannesburg

[1:00:11] Brian Naidus.
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:25] I think that's
[1:00:26] it. I tried to enjoy uh join in with him
[1:00:31] a little bit, brother. I in fact, Joseph
[1:00:34] Daniels was up here. We're behind the
[1:00:36] pulpit and he said, "Come on, Ron. Come
[1:00:37] on." He grabbed my arm. He said, "Come
[1:00:39] on, do
[1:00:41] this." I couldn't even do that in sync
[1:00:44] with him, you know, and he he's trying
[1:00:48] to get me
[1:00:49] to and so anyway, we had a good time and
[1:00:53] they love to sing their African songs. I
[1:00:55] said, "Do you know Hakuna Matata or
[1:00:59] whatever?" You know,
[1:01:08] but uh praise the Lord. The Lord gave us
[1:01:11] a good
[1:01:12] time. I
[1:01:15] enjoy praising God.
[1:01:18] And I believe that saints of God, we
[1:01:19] should be a whole lot less inhibited
[1:01:23] in praising God. Amen. I do. I just I I
[1:01:27] think sometimes we get into a routine
[1:01:30] and and everything and um but anyway,
[1:01:32] praise the Lord. I am glad to be a
[1:01:34] Christian this morning. Amen. God bless
[1:01:37] you. Let's stand together.
[1:01:41] Thank you musicians. I appreciate it. Um
[1:01:45] after this service, No, you know what?
[1:01:47] Before you go, let's sing this song. I
[1:01:50] feel um moved to sing this song. Nations
[1:01:53] are breaking Israel's awakening. The
[1:01:56] signs.
[1:02:02] Amen.
[1:02:05] Okay. Give me the next chorus there. The
[1:02:07] the bottom one there.
[1:02:10] Yeah. Oh,
[1:02:13] nations are breaking.
[1:02:16] Israel's awakening.
[1:02:19] signs that the prophets
[1:02:25] fortold. Gentiles is number
[1:02:29] [Music]
[1:02:34] eternal
[1:02:37] unfold. The day of redemption is
[1:02:43] near. Men's hearts are failing for fear.
[1:02:51] Be filled with the spirit. Your land
[1:02:55] trimmed and
[1:02:58] clear. Look up. Your redemption is near.
[1:03:03] The fig tree is growing. The victory is
[1:03:08] growing. Jerusalem is restoring.
[1:03:13] National lifong
[1:03:22] bey falling.
[1:03:26] Returners to your
[1:03:30] home. The day of redemption is near.
[1:03:37] His hearts are failing for fear.
[1:03:43] Look, filled with a spirit, your lamp
[1:03:48] trimmed and
[1:03:50] clear. Look up. Your redemption is near.
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:03:59] Heavenly
[1:04:01] Father, Lord, as we
[1:04:04] see in our very
[1:04:08] headlines, when we see international
[1:04:11] news, we see all these things. Father,
[1:04:15] we can see the signs of the end all
[1:04:17] around us. Flashing red lights, letting
[1:04:21] us know your prophet told us so many of
[1:04:25] these things. And we thank you for that,
[1:04:26] Father, that we would have the Isab of
[1:04:29] understanding. I pray, Father, come give
[1:04:32] us a quickening
[1:04:34] this morning, Lord. Come and touch
[1:04:36] hearts, draw us closer to you, Father.
[1:04:39] We thank you. We praise you. We commit
[1:04:41] it to thee in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[1:04:45] it. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:49] Thank you musicians. God bless you.
[1:04:52] Let's just remain standing if you
[1:04:57] would. Let's turn to the book of
[1:04:59] Zechariah.
[1:05:01] Zechariah right near the end of the Old
[1:05:03] Testament. Zechariah 12 verses 1-4.
[1:05:16] Zechariah 12 and verse
[1:05:20] one. The burden of the word of the Lord
[1:05:22] for Israel, saith the Lord, which
[1:05:24] stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth
[1:05:27] the foundation of the earth and
[1:05:30] formeth the spirit of man within him.
[1:05:34] Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of
[1:05:37] trembling unto all the people round
[1:05:40] about, when they shall be in the siege,
[1:05:43] both against Judah and against
[1:05:46] Jerusalem. And in that day, I will make
[1:05:48] Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
[1:05:51] people. All that burden themselves with
[1:05:54] it shall be cut in pieces, though all
[1:05:58] the people of the earth be gathered
[1:06:01] together against it.
[1:06:04] In that day, saith the Lord, I will
[1:06:06] smite every horse with astonishment, and
[1:06:09] his rider with madness, and I will open
[1:06:11] mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and
[1:06:14] smite every house horse of the people
[1:06:18] with
[1:06:19] blindness. Amen. Amen. We know that
[1:06:23] Israel is in the
[1:06:25] news. We see it. We know Israel has
[1:06:29] gotten back together. May the 7th, 1946,
[1:06:32] the very brother Bram said the very same
[1:06:34] hour, the very same day that God dealt
[1:06:37] with me at Greensmill, he said, "Israel
[1:06:39] became a nation." He said, "Watch, they
[1:06:42] are connected together."
[1:06:45] It's important to understand that
[1:06:47] because you see, we have a lapping over
[1:06:50] right now of dispensations. Amen. We are
[1:06:53] now at the end of the closing of the
[1:06:55] Gentile
[1:06:56] dispensation and another dispensation is
[1:07:00] coming in for Israel. When the bride
[1:07:03] goes up, the two witnesses come down
[1:07:07] and then they will preach for three and
[1:07:09] a half years there. And we know that
[1:07:12] they're going to be martyed. They're
[1:07:13] going to be killed in the streets, lay
[1:07:15] there for three days, and then God's
[1:07:16] going to raise them up and everything.
[1:07:18] But all of this is connected together.
[1:07:21] Understand?
[1:07:22] that uh when we see all of these things
[1:07:26] happening, it should make us
[1:07:28] aware that the coming of the Lord and
[1:07:32] the closing of the gentile dispensation
[1:07:36] is happening. Amen. And as and most
[1:07:39] prophecy, just like in his first coming,
[1:07:42] most prophecy is fulfilled right in the
[1:07:45] very latter moments of the closing of
[1:07:48] this time. Amen. So turn with me now if
[1:07:51] you would to the book of Revelation
[1:07:54] chapter
[1:07:55] 13. Brother Bram said, "Where do we find
[1:07:59] America?" Revelation chapter 13. 13
[1:08:02] stars, 13 stripes, 13 colonies. He said
[1:08:05] her number is 13. She's found in the
[1:08:08] book of
[1:08:09] Revelation chapter
[1:08:12] 13. Revelation 13 verse starting at
[1:08:15] verse 11.
[1:08:18] And I beheld another beast coming up out
[1:08:21] of the
[1:08:23] earth, and he had two horns like a lamb.
[1:08:26] He was not a lamb. Well, Brother
[1:08:28] Brandham said, "What was that?" It was
[1:08:29] the American buffalo.
[1:08:32] And he spake as a
[1:08:34] dragon. And he exercisth all the power
[1:08:37] of the first beast before him, and
[1:08:40] causes the earth, and them which dwell
[1:08:43] therein to worship the first beast,
[1:08:46] whose deadly wound was healed.
[1:08:50] And he doth great wonders, so that he
[1:08:53] maketh fire come down from heaven on the
[1:08:55] earth in the sight of
[1:08:57] men, and deceiveth them that dwell on
[1:09:00] the earth by means of those miracles
[1:09:02] which he had power to do in the sight of
[1:09:04] the beast, saying to them that dwell on
[1:09:08] the earth, that they should make an
[1:09:09] image to the beast, which had the wound
[1:09:13] by the sword, and did live. And he had
[1:09:16] power to give life unto the image of the
[1:09:19] beast. And that image of the beast
[1:09:21] should both speak and to cause that as
[1:09:24] many as would not worship the image of
[1:09:27] the beast should be
[1:09:29] killed. Notice this now. And he causes
[1:09:32] all, both small and great, rich and
[1:09:35] poor, free in bond, to receive a mark in
[1:09:39] their right hand or in their
[1:09:41] foreheads, that no man might buy or
[1:09:44] sell, save he that had the mark, or the
[1:09:47] name of the beast, or the number of his
[1:09:49] name. And here is wisdom. Let him that
[1:09:53] hath
[1:09:54] understanding count the number of the
[1:09:56] beasts, for it's the number of a man,
[1:10:00] and his number is 600 three score
[1:10:08] six66. We all know the prophet of God
[1:10:10] said, "Who is that?" It's a number of a
[1:10:12] man. Who is it? It's the pope. He sits
[1:10:15] on a throne there over seven hills. We
[1:10:18] see it according to prophecy. Above his
[1:10:21] throne is vicarious feli day which means
[1:10:24] the vicor of God and in Roman lettering
[1:10:27] that's
[1:10:29] 666. May God bless the reading of his
[1:10:31] word. You may be seated this morning in
[1:10:33] his
[1:10:37] presence. Now I will try to not hold you
[1:10:40] too long this morning. We'll see see how
[1:10:43] it goes.
[1:10:45] And I would like to title my sermon this
[1:10:49] morning, current events made clear by
[1:10:52] prophecy. And I want to take the subject
[1:10:55] of the flashing red lights of the
[1:10:58] sign of his
[1:11:01] coming. Now, as you all know, I'm sure
[1:11:04] probably everyone in here is totally
[1:11:07] aware that there's been a newly elected
[1:11:10] pope.
[1:11:13] And we all know that the brother
[1:11:17] Brandham spoke about a new pope coming
[1:11:20] out of the United States in 1954,
[1:11:26] approximately 71 years ago. This prophet
[1:11:29] tells us, watch this new pope that comes
[1:11:33] out of the United States. Now, according
[1:11:36] to all of the
[1:11:38] uh rumors and stuff you were hearing
[1:11:40] from the news, it did not seem like
[1:11:43] there was a cardinal in the running for
[1:11:46] being pope. And Sandy and I had we were
[1:11:50] on our way from um here in Phoenix up to
[1:11:54] our cabin and we had just gotten up on
[1:11:57] top there and you lost signal until we
[1:11:59] got right there to our cabin and because
[1:12:02] they were saying, "Hey, new there's
[1:12:04] white smoke." That's and we're just kind
[1:12:06] of waiting for the news and then she she
[1:12:08] she just goes, "Oh, oh, oh, I thought I
[1:12:12] run over something or hit something or
[1:12:14] whatever." And she said, "Uh, it's a
[1:12:16] pope from America.
[1:12:18] a pope from America. Now, um we know
[1:12:23] that history is going to repeat
[1:12:26] itself and we see the players. Now, I
[1:12:29] want you to all just be acutely aware
[1:12:32] that all of those that are in these
[1:12:35] positions of governments and leaders and
[1:12:38] all of that, they are absolutely taking
[1:12:41] their position. Amen. Amen. The
[1:12:45] chessboard or the puzzle piece or
[1:12:47] whatever you want to say, they're all
[1:12:49] taking their position because the bride
[1:12:51] is taking her position. I want you to
[1:12:55] understand all of this has been
[1:12:57] prophetically told us. The Bible is a
[1:13:00] book of prophecy. It foretells future
[1:13:03] events. That's what a prophet does. He
[1:13:06] doesn't tell you after the fact, "Oh, I
[1:13:09] think the Lord had told me that you."
[1:13:11] No, he tells you years ago. Imagine
[1:13:14] someone telling you 71 years ago the new
[1:13:17] pope will come out of the United States.
[1:13:20] Now, um all another thing I want you to
[1:13:23] be acutely aware of is the anti-semitism
[1:13:26] that is rising up here in America. It's
[1:13:29] happening on our college campuses in
[1:13:32] cities. They're having protests and
[1:13:34] signs uh from uh you know the sea to the
[1:13:38] border or whatever. All these kind of
[1:13:40] things. And the Palestinians do not want
[1:13:42] peace with Israel. They want to kill all
[1:13:45] the Jews.
[1:13:47] Now, I want you to understand, Brother
[1:13:49] Brennham said in World War II, Hitler,
[1:13:52] Mussolini, and Stalin were
[1:13:56] pre-tribulation spirits that were poured
[1:13:59] out on the people. And he says that
[1:14:01] shows you a preview of what's to come.
[1:14:04] Yes.
[1:14:06] So this anti-semitism, it's not going to
[1:14:09] stop there.
[1:14:11] It's going to go, it's going to get more
[1:14:13] and more. And it's going to come after
[1:14:15] also the Christians.
[1:14:18] And we're going to show you that the
[1:14:20] image of the
[1:14:22] beast is going to have power. And I want
[1:14:25] to show you, I've got a couple small
[1:14:27] clips. I did not put these together, but
[1:14:30] you just bear with me now. I'm going to
[1:14:32] play you one here um that shows that
[1:14:36] this uh religious man, I don't know of
[1:14:40] what religion he is, but he is calling
[1:14:43] uh President Trump
[1:14:46] uh like li like unto Constantine the
[1:14:51] Great. Go ahead if you play the video.
[1:14:53] Your leadership, you embody the values
[1:14:56] of our Christian faith and love for the
[1:14:59] gospel.
[1:15:01] You remind me of the great Roman Emperor
[1:15:05] Constantine the
[1:15:07] [Applause]
[1:15:13] Great. This
[1:15:15] emperor, this emperor, your dear Mr.
[1:15:19] President, is the one who founded and
[1:15:22] built the magnificent city of
[1:15:25] Constantinople, my birthplace.
[1:15:29] No.
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:32] known today as Istanbul. It is my great
[1:15:36] honor to present you with this holy
[1:15:39] cross.
[1:15:41] Remember Constantine had a cross.
[1:15:43] Remember the dream he had.
[1:15:48] This cross is the very symbol that led
[1:15:52] this great Roman Emperor Constantine to
[1:15:56] victory. As Christ revealed to him in a
[1:16:00] vision, he said, "And Tutoto Nika told
[1:16:04] the emperor means go with this and be
[1:16:09] victorious. Mr.
[1:16:10] President, this cross is an everlasting
[1:16:14] symbol of peace and an invincible
[1:16:18] trophy, a sign of divine strength and
[1:16:22] guidance. With this cross, I pray you
[1:16:26] bring peace to the world and make
[1:16:29] America invincible.
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:46] All right. Make America invincible.
[1:16:52] This is a symbol. And may you be the
[1:16:54] leader of peace. Remember now the Bible
[1:16:56] says when they begin to say peace and
[1:16:58] safety, then comes sudden destruction.
[1:17:02] Okay? So we're seeing types and shadows
[1:17:05] here uh of Constantine. They're calling
[1:17:09] uh President Trump uh likened unto the
[1:17:12] great Roman emperor Constantine. So when
[1:17:15] you see a few quotes, let me show you a
[1:17:17] few quotes now to substantiate this
[1:17:20] Pergamian church age. Brother Brenham
[1:17:22] says, "But this freedom from persecution
[1:17:25] and death was not magnanimous as it
[1:17:28] first appeared.
[1:17:30] Constantine was now the patron. As a
[1:17:34] patron, his interest was somewhat more
[1:17:37] than that of an observer. For he decided
[1:17:40] that the church needed his help for her
[1:17:43] affairs. I want you to understand, Pope
[1:17:45] kind of feels like he's the savior of
[1:17:47] everybody and everything. Amen. He got
[1:17:49] to he's got to put his hands into
[1:17:52] everybody's business
[1:17:55] and he's a dealmaker.
[1:17:58] Okay, understand this. He is there for a
[1:18:01] purpose. He's a dealmaker. But let's go
[1:18:03] on. I can't read all of the quote, but
[1:18:05] I'm going to just give you uh some of
[1:18:07] this. With such matters along with the
[1:18:10] instruction of pagan ceremony into
[1:18:13] worship, the emperor called for the
[1:18:15] Nyian council in
[1:18:17] 3:25 with the thought that he would
[1:18:19] bring all groups together that they
[1:18:22] could iron out their differences and
[1:18:24] come to a common
[1:18:26] understanding and all be one. Isn't it
[1:18:30] peculiar that though this started with
[1:18:32] Constantine, it didn't die but is very
[1:18:36] much alive today as a world council of
[1:18:39] churches and where he failed to achieve
[1:18:42] it, it will be achieved in this day
[1:18:46] through the ecumenical move.
[1:18:48] Now here's a prophet foretelling you
[1:18:50] future events. Take the World Council of
[1:18:54] Churches and the Confederation of
[1:18:56] Churches. The Catholic Church has been
[1:18:59] withholding
[1:19:00] itself. But now with this new pope, he
[1:19:04] is bringing all of the world religions
[1:19:07] together. That's one of his um let's say
[1:19:11] things that he wants to do, one of the
[1:19:14] goals he wants to do.
[1:19:16] So the Catholic Church has held out of
[1:19:20] the World Council of Churches, but this
[1:19:23] pope's wanting to bring them in.
[1:19:26] Understand this is all according to
[1:19:28] prophecy. All right, let's go
[1:19:32] on. Pergamian church age paragraph 195.
[1:19:36] People look at Rome. They look at the
[1:19:38] nation of Italy and as they look they do
[1:19:41] not realize that Rome with her strict
[1:19:44] confines where the pope has an actual
[1:19:47] area in his domain is literally a nation
[1:19:50] within a nation and she has ambassadors
[1:19:53] and receives
[1:19:55] ambassadors. Paple false Christian Rome.
[1:19:58] She is even called the eternal city. How
[1:20:02] blasphemous.
[1:20:03] now controls by religion even more aly
[1:20:07] than when pagan imperial Rome controlled
[1:20:11] by the pure iron for iron of force. Rome
[1:20:17] took a new lease on life when
[1:20:19] Constantine joined church and state and
[1:20:22] backed the union by force. That spirit
[1:20:25] motivated pagan Rome is the same spirit
[1:20:28] that now motivates false Christian Rome.
[1:20:34] Now, Brother Brandham's identifying
[1:20:36] spirits. And he says, "As it was, so
[1:20:39] shall it be." He was a typologist. I
[1:20:42] look and see what they did in the
[1:20:43] scripture, and then I know what's going
[1:20:46] to happen in the future. Amen.
[1:20:48] Okay, here's uh again paragraph
[1:20:52] 206 and that is what Constantine and his
[1:20:57] successors did at Nia and after Nia they
[1:21:01] invited the people of God to the
[1:21:04] convention. And when the church sat down
[1:21:06] to eat and rose up to play partaking of
[1:21:09] church form and ceremonies and pagan
[1:21:12] feasts named after Christian rights, she
[1:21:15] was trapped. She had committed
[1:21:17] fornication and God walked out.
[1:21:21] Paragraph 370, resume of the ages. This
[1:21:25] second step was the doctrine of Balum
[1:21:27] described in Revelation 2:14, wherein
[1:21:30] Balam taught Bailo to stumble the
[1:21:33] children of Israel by a united meeting.
[1:21:36] There the guests would uh would do two
[1:21:39] more things contrary to the word. And
[1:21:43] I'm just going to go down to the
[1:21:44] highlighted part here. Now, that didn't
[1:21:48] only happen back there to God's church
[1:21:51] of the Old Testament, but it happened to
[1:21:54] the church of the New Testament. For
[1:21:56] there was an emperor who like Baleo
[1:21:59] needed to help secure his kingdom. So
[1:22:03] Constantine invited the nominal
[1:22:05] Christian first Christian church of Rome
[1:22:08] to help him get the Christians behind
[1:22:11] him as they were a very large body. The
[1:22:14] outcome was the Nioan council of
[1:22:17] 3:25. There the Christians both true and
[1:22:20] nominal came together at the invitation
[1:22:23] of Constantine and the true Christians
[1:22:26] had no business even going up to the
[1:22:29] meeting. Yeah. Now,
[1:22:33] I want you to understand this is the
[1:22:34] first time in the history of the of the
[1:22:37] United States that this president and
[1:22:40] his cabinet and his administration staff
[1:22:44] is predominantly Catholic.
[1:22:49] Are we together on that? Catholic.
[1:22:52] And uh so I want to play you another uh
[1:22:57] clip here. So, let's just take this and
[1:23:00] listen.
[1:23:01] Now, more than ever, our nation needs a
[1:23:04] renewal of the values this organization
[1:23:07] promotes and that the Catholic faithful
[1:23:09] live out each and every day in peace. We
[1:23:13] love the Catholic people. We love the
[1:23:16] Catholic religion. And above all, we
[1:23:19] respect it greatly. As president, I will
[1:23:22] always support you in your effort to
[1:23:24] serve our fellow citizens and to lift up
[1:23:27] all humanity. I will protect the
[1:23:29] Catholic Church and I will defend the
[1:23:31] rights of religious believers of every
[1:23:33] race, religion. Every religion is a way
[1:23:36] to arrive at God. Sort of a comparison,
[1:23:38] an example would be there sort of like
[1:23:40] different languages in order to arrive
[1:23:42] at God. And if God is God for all, then
[1:23:44] we're all sons and daughters of God. One
[1:23:48] reason to believe this might be a short
[1:23:51] conclave. The cardinals have been in
[1:23:52] Rome since Pope Francis died. They've
[1:23:55] had time to get acquainted, discuss the
[1:23:58] needs in the direction of the church,
[1:24:00] and highlight the concerns of their
[1:24:01] flock back home, and they've done some
[1:24:05] politicking. Now, Cardinal Dolan and
[1:24:07] Cardinal Tobin, they are two of the 10
[1:24:10] US cardinals who will vote for the next
[1:24:12] pope. The geographic makeup of the
[1:24:15] conclave could go a long way in
[1:24:17] determining the next pontiff. In fact,
[1:24:18] today one cardinal told ABC News he
[1:24:21] wouldn't be surprised if the next pope
[1:24:23] comes from Asia or Africa where the
[1:24:26] church has seen significant growth. Of
[1:24:29] the 133 cardinal electors, only 25 were
[1:24:33] appointed by John Paul or Benedict. And
[1:24:36] finally, you probably noticed no
[1:24:38] American cardinals listed among the
[1:24:40] leading contenders. Father Brian
[1:24:43] Massenale from Forom University explains
[1:24:45] why. candidates from the United States,
[1:24:48] Carlos from the United States enter with
[1:24:50] somewhat of a handicap because the
[1:24:53] United States is such a major global
[1:24:56] force in the world. I think many are
[1:24:59] reluctant to add the power of the papacy
[1:25:04] also to the United States's power in the
[1:25:07] world. But Father Massingale did concede
[1:25:10] it's unlikely, but it's not impossible
[1:25:13] to one day have an American pope. I
[1:25:15] believe one of these glorious days when
[1:25:18] this united confederation church goes
[1:25:20] together and the new pope is brought
[1:25:22] around in the United States and put over
[1:25:24] there according to prophecy then the
[1:25:26] former in life to the peace and I tell
[1:25:28] you the true church of God will be
[1:25:30] thrown together the real true believers
[1:25:33] are Methodists Baptist Presbyterians
[1:25:35] Pentecostals Nazarene pilgrim holiness
[1:25:38] whatever they'll be go together cemented
[1:25:40] by the love of God that'll make the body
[1:25:43] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:25:45] All the believers that are agnostics and
[1:25:48] shallow mind that it'll be tacked to one
[1:25:49] side. They'll go right away into the
[1:25:51] confederation churches.
[1:25:54] Now, and in the middle of the week, the
[1:25:58] middle of this Jewish week, see that's
[1:26:01] three and a half
[1:26:03] years, the Antichrist, the prince, a
[1:26:06] prince that is to come. And remember, he
[1:26:09] comes out of Rome. Amen. The prince that
[1:26:13] is to come. What is he? A
[1:26:15] pope, a prince amongst the people that
[1:26:19] is to come. There'll rise up a pharaoh
[1:26:22] who doesn't know Joseph. Now you
[1:26:24] Protestants say, "Well, now that's it
[1:26:26] for just a minute." We find out that the
[1:26:28] Protestants has an organization makes a
[1:26:31] confederation of churches an image to
[1:26:33] the beast and go right with
[1:26:34] them. And we find out here that the Jews
[1:26:37] are called in on this confederation.
[1:26:41] Yes, sir. And they agree. And the Bible
[1:26:43] said they did. And he makes a covenant
[1:26:45] with them in the midst of the uh 70th
[1:26:49] week. He break the antichrist the breaks
[1:26:52] his covenant with the Jews. Amen. Thy
[1:26:54] people.
[1:26:56] Why? And we read in Revelations 11 that
[1:26:59] I'll send that's 11. You're coming over
[1:27:01] towards 19 now. That he will send his uh
[1:27:04] two prophets and they'll prophesy in
[1:27:07] that time. And then they'll get angry at
[1:27:09] these prophets and actually kill them.
[1:27:11] Is that right? Amen. And their dead body
[1:27:13] shall lay in the spiritual street called
[1:27:15] Sodom and Gomorrah where our Lord was
[1:27:16] crucified, Jerusalem. Is that right? And
[1:27:19] they lay there for three days and
[1:27:21] nights. And after three days and night,
[1:27:23] the spirit of life will come into them
[1:27:24] and they'll be raised up and go into
[1:27:26] glory. The 10th part of the city failed
[1:27:28] at that time. Is that right?
[1:27:30] See what is that in the middle of this
[1:27:32] last 70 years when the church goes up
[1:27:36] then the confederation the sleeping
[1:27:37] virgin Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[1:27:40] and lukewarm Pentecost
[1:27:42] all of them together with the
[1:27:43] confederation which they've already got
[1:27:45] their
[1:27:45] big regime now and when they do they'll
[1:27:49] make a covenant well now this new pulp
[1:27:52] that we got now wants to bring them all
[1:27:53] in. Can't you see the things we've been
[1:27:55] up
[1:27:57] give a talk on it and bring them all in?
[1:27:58] First time for hundreds and hundreds and
[1:28:00] hundreds of years a thousand years the
[1:28:02] Jews ever been done but now he to bring
[1:28:05] them all in together and make a
[1:28:07] confederation in there the Jews will
[1:28:10] accept it. Amen.
[1:28:12] Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Praise be to
[1:28:16] our God who lives forever and ever.
[1:28:18] Hallelujah. There you are. Amen. My
[1:28:21] brother, it's just as simple as simple
[1:28:22] as a little kid could see.
[1:28:26] The confederation
[1:28:28] are bringing Jewish and Protestant and
[1:28:30] Catholic together.
[1:28:32] And remember, what's these two prophets
[1:28:35] going to do when they come?
[1:28:37] This beast, this
[1:28:40] prince that shall scatter the power of
[1:28:42] the holy people, what will he do? He'll
[1:28:44] break his covenant with them after three
[1:28:47] and a half years. He'll oust them.
[1:28:50] How people think that's communism?
[1:28:52] That's just because you the spirit of
[1:28:54] God hasn't dealt with you yet. It's not
[1:28:57] communism. It's religion. Religion. The
[1:29:00] Bible said to be so close to deceive the
[1:29:02] very elected if possible. Jesus said so.
[1:29:05] He in the land.
[1:29:08] Notice communism. Russia. Russia wants
[1:29:12] to unite all the world in one because
[1:29:15] they got a oneness desire in their
[1:29:18] heart. But they want to unite them all
[1:29:21] under
[1:29:22] communism. That's their idea. See,
[1:29:24] that's man's while the UN wants to unite
[1:29:28] them, too. All under the
[1:29:31] UN to what? Unite them together in a
[1:29:34] military
[1:29:36] power. What about the Catholics? They
[1:29:40] want to unite the whole world under one
[1:29:43] Catholicism. What about the Protestant?
[1:29:47] He wants to unite them all under one
[1:29:49] under the Federation of
[1:29:51] Churches just as wrong and black as the
[1:29:54] Catholics are.
[1:29:57] It's the same old lying devil.
[1:30:00] [Applause]
[1:30:01] It's true.
[1:30:04] That's a fatal
[1:30:06] mistake. Why they want they want them
[1:30:08] all to be a federation of churches.
[1:30:11] We're all under one head. As long as I
[1:30:14] can be
[1:30:16] ruler, Catholics want them all under one
[1:30:18] head. Pope can be the ruler. Russia
[1:30:21] wants them all under one head. So,
[1:30:23] communism to be the ruler. UN wants them
[1:30:27] all under one head. So, we the United
[1:30:29] States can kind of be the boss because
[1:30:30] we're the biggest nation. It's all the
[1:30:33] same devils.
[1:30:35] And every nation in the world is
[1:30:38] controlled by the devil. So the Bible
[1:30:40] says
[1:30:42] here we have no continuing city but we
[1:30:44] seek one to come. Why do you not
[1:30:47] understand something like that? It's
[1:30:48] lost to begin
[1:30:50] with but all of them want united under
[1:30:54] that. Let me drop this in. I hope my
[1:30:58] watch don't alarm too quick. Look listen
[1:31:01] the people today are scared to death of
[1:31:03] communism.
[1:31:05] Shame.
[1:31:07] Well, what are you scared of communism?
[1:31:09] I want any theologian, any Bible scholar
[1:31:12] to show me where communism will rule the
[1:31:14] world? I tell you, Romanism is going to
[1:31:16] rule the world according to the Bible.
[1:31:18] You watch about that. Don't watch iron
[1:31:21] curtains and bamboo curtains, but watch
[1:31:22] the purple curtain. Yes, sir. That's the
[1:31:24] one's going to get you. Don't you ever
[1:31:26] worry about that. That you just mark
[1:31:27] that down and say, "Brother Brandon, set
[1:31:28] it and put it in your Bible and see if
[1:31:30] it's right." Communism is nothing but a
[1:31:32] tool in God's hand playing right up.
[1:31:34] Well, it won't mount to nothing. It's
[1:31:35] exactly right. Don't fear about that.
[1:31:37] That's something to throw you off the
[1:31:39] track of looking. But Bible readers and
[1:31:41] men who love God stay with what the
[1:31:43] Bible says. Amen. Certainly. Just watch
[1:31:46] that now more than ever.
[1:31:52] These things are coming together,
[1:31:55] saints,
[1:31:56] and it behooves us to look at these
[1:31:58] current events,
[1:32:00] and see because the prophetic pieces to
[1:32:03] the puzzle are all fitting together.
[1:32:07] It's making an image. That's right. And
[1:32:09] they're going to come into power.
[1:32:12] Brother Brennham says, "How will the
[1:32:13] mark of the beast come about? It'll come
[1:32:16] forth like a union, and you will not be
[1:32:19] able to buy and sell. You want to
[1:32:21] control people, you control them through
[1:32:23] their money. Amen. You won't be able to
[1:32:26] buy and sell. And that's when people
[1:32:28] sell out.
[1:32:30] Now, we're all concerned about our
[1:32:33] national debt. How many trillion dollars
[1:32:35] is it now? Keeps going. I think the last
[1:32:37] I heard 36 trillion. You hear about it.
[1:32:42] You hear about your gas going up. You
[1:32:44] hear about it costs more to to buy bread
[1:32:46] and eggs and and all of your living
[1:32:50] items. And we're all concerned about our
[1:32:53] national debt. You cannot keep
[1:32:56] spending like you have an unlimited
[1:32:59] account. And yet the people in our
[1:33:02] government have been doing that. Amen.
[1:33:04] So now Doge is trying to stop the
[1:33:07] hemorrhaging of all of the billions of
[1:33:10] dollars and showing I just ask one
[1:33:13] question. These people that have
[1:33:15] fraudulently taken money into these
[1:33:19] crazy places and put this money, why are
[1:33:22] they not going to jail for embezzlement
[1:33:26] and fraudulent activity? Amen. And yet
[1:33:29] it was your tax dollars that is helping
[1:33:32] to support all of these things. Now I
[1:33:37] would venture to say every pulpit around
[1:33:41] the message around the world right now
[1:33:43] is talking about this one event because
[1:33:47] it's tying all of the events of the end
[1:33:51] time together. Now listen to me. When
[1:33:54] the Pope came out of the United States,
[1:33:57] I didn't start dancing and saying, "Now
[1:33:59] I believe the message." No, I've always
[1:34:02] believed the message. It just happened
[1:34:04] to be another thing I'm saying.
[1:34:07] It's going home time. We're getting
[1:34:10] ready. We've been ready. We've been
[1:34:11] hearing a voice. We heard the shout, the
[1:34:13] voice. Huh? Praise God. We've had
[1:34:16] something that has quickened us. We're
[1:34:18] different. He that hath an ear to hear,
[1:34:21] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[1:34:23] to the church. So, we've been quickened.
[1:34:26] We've been energized.
[1:34:28] We've been made partakers of the
[1:34:31] understanding of what God is going to do
[1:34:33] in this end time. So, we have all this
[1:34:36] stuff, national debt and your taxes and
[1:34:39] all of this kind of stuff. And we we
[1:34:42] don't know how long can we keep going.
[1:34:45] Yeah. With this amount of debt. Come on.
[1:34:48] You see now, brother Brennham talks
[1:34:50] about America's going to go bankrupt
[1:34:53] and all of this is going to tie
[1:34:55] together. Why? Because you're going to
[1:34:57] find out she's going to get bailed out
[1:34:59] by Rome.
[1:35:01] So, watch all these players now getting
[1:35:04] together.
[1:35:06] Let me show you in the sermon
[1:35:08] blasphemous names
[1:35:10] 62. We're almost bankrupt.
[1:35:14] 1962.
[1:35:22] 62.
[1:35:23] He says we're almost bankrupt.
[1:35:28] We're borrowing, spending money now on
[1:35:30] taxes that'll be paid 14 years from
[1:35:32] today. That's how far we are gone. Who
[1:35:37] has got the money of the world, Catholic
[1:35:39] Church?
[1:35:41] How would it be loaned to the United
[1:35:43] States to keep these tobacco and whiskey
[1:35:46] companies and things? Sure, they'll
[1:35:48] borrow it from them. And when they do,
[1:35:51] they'll sell their birthights right out
[1:35:53] to the Roman Catholic Church. Can we
[1:35:56] consolidate? Watch this. Just plain
[1:35:58] plainer than reading a newspaper.
[1:36:02] Stature of a perfect
[1:36:06] band. Did you hear the lifeline the
[1:36:09] other morning? Why? You know, it's just
[1:36:12] like you sell bonds on gold. The bonds
[1:36:14] is already took up and this present
[1:36:17] government now is spending money for
[1:36:19] what? The tax for tax money that they'll
[1:36:23] be collecting 40 years from now. She's
[1:36:26] done. See
[1:36:28] taxes they're spending and trying to buy
[1:36:32] foreign. Now, if you follow that thought
[1:36:34] out, Brother Bram said, "We're giving
[1:36:37] billions or billions of dollars at that
[1:36:40] time to foreign entities to have them be
[1:36:43] our ally." In other words, I'll pay you
[1:36:46] to be my friend.
[1:36:48] So, we're seeing all that stuff
[1:36:50] is is being exposed where they're just
[1:36:55] giving it out anyway. Don't you see?
[1:36:58] That's exactly what they're going to do.
[1:37:01] See, what is it? Now, if this nation
[1:37:03] goes busted, the only thing it can do is
[1:37:07] go busted. The only thing it can do is
[1:37:10] go bankrupt. That's the only sensible
[1:37:13] thing to do. Change the currency. But
[1:37:16] they won't do it. Under this present
[1:37:18] ministration, Roman Catholic Church owns
[1:37:20] the gold of the world. And what'll they
[1:37:23] do is sell out these rich men and so
[1:37:26] forth of the earth as the Bible said. uh
[1:37:30] see and he talks about these uh whiskey
[1:37:32] and tobacco companies most all of it's
[1:37:35] Catholic anyhow and all these other
[1:37:38] things what will they do they'll accept
[1:37:39] that and they'll take the money from
[1:37:42] Rome then she sold her very birthright
[1:37:45] Rome backs her up yes sir she'll back it
[1:37:48] up and they're getting enough policy now
[1:37:51] getting enough around them bringing in
[1:37:52] his cabinet look at what Mr. Kennedy is
[1:37:56] asking
[1:37:57] for. Now, as I told you, this is the
[1:38:01] first
[1:38:02] administration in the United States. The
[1:38:05] predominant cabinet and administration
[1:38:08] is Catholic.
[1:38:11] Remember, it's an image
[1:38:14] rising up. Starts out, it looks like a
[1:38:17] lamb,
[1:38:19] but it's going to speak like a dragon.
[1:38:23] Okay? So don't get too comfortable.
[1:38:26] Trump is not going to make everything
[1:38:28] bitter. Trump is not going to make
[1:38:30] America great again. She's gone. She's
[1:38:33] She's done for. It is written over the
[1:38:36] wall. Don't you get too comfortable
[1:38:38] here. Don't set your tent pigs down too
[1:38:42] much. You get ready to get out of here.
[1:38:45] Amen. That's what this message came to
[1:38:47] do is to let you know the king is
[1:38:49] coming. The king is coming. understand
[1:38:53] this. Get ready. It's just about over. I
[1:38:57] don't have to wait for LA to sink. I
[1:39:00] don't have to wait for all of this
[1:39:01] stuff. I don't have to wait for the
[1:39:03] bankruptcy. I'm getting ready now.
[1:39:09] Amen.
[1:39:12] Blasphemous names
[1:39:15] 62. Just like it is today, here we are.
[1:39:18] I, as I said, we're almost bankrupt.
[1:39:21] We're borrowing, spending money now on
[1:39:23] taxes paid 14 years from today. That's
[1:39:27] how far we are gone. Who got the money
[1:39:29] of the world? The Catholic Church. Who
[1:39:32] would it be loaned to the United States?
[1:39:34] See, sure, they'll borrow it from them.
[1:39:37] And when they do, they'll sell their
[1:39:38] birth rates out to the Roman Catholic
[1:39:40] Church. We consolidate. I read that
[1:39:42] quote. I'm sorry. It's the second time,
[1:39:44] but you needed it anyway. You didn't
[1:39:45] catch it the first time.
[1:39:50] The debt of America is in the trillions
[1:39:52] of dollars.
[1:39:54] If you were to just pay the interest
[1:39:56] alone, you would never catch up.
[1:40:01] So all of this
[1:40:03] exposure and why do they not like Trump?
[1:40:06] Because he's exposing the corruption
[1:40:09] from within.
[1:40:11] And even though he's in he's in office,
[1:40:14] a little judge here in Florida stops
[1:40:17] this program. little one over here and
[1:40:19] this and that. Since when?
[1:40:22] Well, you're seeing the opposition. This
[1:40:25] is the first time in the history of the
[1:40:27] United States that America is so
[1:40:29] completely divided.
[1:40:33] Amen. Amen. If you can't see it and see
[1:40:38] that this whole thing is just crumbling,
[1:40:41] hey, I I'm excited.
[1:40:43] I am. Thank God we're seeing these
[1:40:46] things come to pass. And
[1:40:51] um for in the first seal, now I'm going
[1:40:54] to read because this is the last several
[1:40:56] quotes I got all from the first seal.
[1:40:59] Just just bear with me now for a moment
[1:41:02] if I as I read this. In fact, I was
[1:41:06] going to have the brothers to go ahead
[1:41:07] and have brother Brennham to to do it,
[1:41:10] but I didn't have time to get them to
[1:41:12] set it up. And so let me read from the
[1:41:15] first seal. Now watch. In the end time,
[1:41:18] not in the early days when Christ was
[1:41:20] preaching, but in the end time, the last
[1:41:22] part of the week. Now, how many know
[1:41:25] that in the 70 weeks of Daniel, in the
[1:41:28] 70th week, Christ was cut off in the
[1:41:31] midst of the week? How many know that
[1:41:34] the first three and a half years or the
[1:41:36] first half of the 70th week of Daniel
[1:41:40] has already been fulfilled? And Christ
[1:41:42] was cut off in the midst of the week.
[1:41:46] And so this last half is going to be
[1:41:50] three and a half years. How long's the
[1:41:52] tribulation? Three and a half years.
[1:41:54] It's not seven years. He was cut off in
[1:41:57] the midst of the week. Amen. Amen. Is
[1:42:00] the bride going to go through the
[1:42:02] tribulation?
[1:42:03] No. She's going to be gone. So I'm
[1:42:06] saying these things are all getting
[1:42:08] prepared. And I'll tell you what, you
[1:42:10] better have the Holy Ghost. You better
[1:42:12] have the token applied to you and to
[1:42:14] your family. Cuz if you don't, you're
[1:42:16] foolish virgin and you're going to see
[1:42:18] the two witnesses.
[1:42:22] Cuz if you miss this Elijah,
[1:42:25] you'll catch the next one.
[1:42:28] God, help us to have the Isab an
[1:42:30] understanding of where we're at.
[1:42:34] See, is that right? this prince in that
[1:42:37] time is to make a covenant with Daniel's
[1:42:39] people, which is the Jews. That's when
[1:42:42] the bride's taken out. Now, she won't
[1:42:46] see it. They're making all of this
[1:42:48] stuff, getting ready to do it, but how
[1:42:51] close are we? We're not going to see it,
[1:42:54] but we're seeing all of the mechanics
[1:42:56] and dynamics being put together. So, how
[1:43:00] close are we? Amen. Amen.
[1:43:04] Next, this is just these are all
[1:43:06] chronologically in order. Uh in the last
[1:43:10] one and a half Daniels week, the people
[1:43:12] makes a covenant. This prince makes a
[1:43:14] covenant with Rome. Makes a covenant
[1:43:17] with them no doubt for the wealth for
[1:43:19] Catholic and Jews hold the wealth of the
[1:43:21] world. Then he goes in, he says, I was
[1:43:24] in the Vatican. Well, just go in and
[1:43:26] kneel down on one knee and kiss his
[1:43:28] finger. Because they told him, don't
[1:43:29] turn your back on the Pope. you go in,
[1:43:32] they wouldn't even let him have pant leg
[1:43:34] cuffs and stuff and said, "So you you
[1:43:37] you when you when you exit, don't turn
[1:43:39] your back on him and walk away from
[1:43:41] him." He said, "Okay, I'll call him Holy
[1:43:43] Father, whatever he wants, but I will
[1:43:46] not bow and kiss his ring." Amen. So he
[1:43:49] never got to meet the Pope. Thank God
[1:43:53] that he had enough gump, huh, to just
[1:43:56] say, "Hey, you know what? I'll call him
[1:43:58] whatever he wants." Yeah. I'll follow
[1:44:01] whatever protocol, but I'm not going to
[1:44:02] kiss his ring. I'm not going to bow
[1:44:04] down. But the world rulers are all doing
[1:44:06] it. You watch Trump will do it.
[1:44:10] He'll gravel at his feet. Amen.
[1:44:15] I said, "That's out. That's out." No,
[1:44:17] sir. I says, "I'll call any man a
[1:44:19] brother that wants to be a brother. I'll
[1:44:21] call him Reverend if he wants to be the
[1:44:23] title of that. But to worship a man
[1:44:25] that'll belong that all belongs to Jesus
[1:44:28] Christ." No, sir. kissing no man's hand
[1:44:30] like
[1:44:31] that he said look at it hundred billion
[1:44:34] billion dollars instead of the wealth of
[1:44:36] the world the Bible said was found in
[1:44:39] her just think of the great places the
[1:44:42] billion times and he goes on he said
[1:44:45] communism ain't nothing it's a tool in
[1:44:47] the hand of God to bring revenge upon
[1:44:49] the earth for the blood of the saints
[1:44:51] that's
[1:44:52] right
[1:44:54] now after the church is taken away now
[1:44:57] we're talking about bride Here we're not
[1:44:59] talking about church. Church will go
[1:45:01] through tribulation. Are we together on
[1:45:03] the doctrinal teaching? So the church
[1:45:06] here right now is synonymous for the
[1:45:08] bride. After the church is taken away,
[1:45:11] Rome and the Jews will make a covenant
[1:45:14] with one another. Bible said they would
[1:45:16] with the holy people. This nation is
[1:45:18] going to go busted. And the rest of the
[1:45:19] world that's on the gold standard is
[1:45:22] busted. You know that if we're living
[1:45:25] off of taxes, do bills for 40 years from
[1:45:28] now, where are we at? There's only one
[1:45:31] thing can happen. That's to call in the
[1:45:33] currency, pay off the bonds. We can't do
[1:45:36] it. Wall Street owns them. And Wall
[1:45:38] Street's controlled by the Jews. Now,
[1:45:41] stop here a minute. We're talking Wall
[1:45:43] Street Jews, not the 144,000.
[1:45:48] Paul said, "Not all who is a Jew who is
[1:45:53] Jew, but a Jew who's one inwardly."
[1:45:56] We're not talking Wall Street Jew.
[1:45:58] We're talking there's We're not talking
[1:46:01] the real Jew. We're talking Wall Street
[1:46:03] Jew. Okay.
[1:46:06] The rest of it's in the Vatican. So, you
[1:46:08] got two people got it. The Jews and the
[1:46:11] Vatican. And the Jews got the rest of it
[1:46:14] in Wall Street with the commerce of the
[1:46:15] world.
[1:46:18] And then, okay, I'm going to go to
[1:46:20] paragraph 352. Let's let's go on down
[1:46:23] here so I can save some time. The rich
[1:46:27] merchants of the earth are holded. Then
[1:46:29] there's only one thing to do. The
[1:46:31] Catholic Church can pay it off. She's
[1:46:33] the only one that's got the money. She
[1:46:35] can do it and she will do it. And in
[1:46:37] doing this to get it, she'll compromise
[1:46:40] with the Jews and make a covenant. Then
[1:46:43] she makes this covenant with the Jews.
[1:46:45] Now remember, I'm taking this from the
[1:46:47] scriptures. And now when she does and
[1:46:50] makes this covenant, we notice in Daniel
[1:46:52] 8 verse 23 and 25 will go will cause
[1:46:56] craft to prosper and craft his
[1:46:59] manufacturing in his hand. Paragraph
[1:47:02] 355. And he makes this covenant with the
[1:47:05] Jews. And in the midst of three and a
[1:47:07] half years, he breaks his covenant as
[1:47:09] soon as he gets the thing wrapped up and
[1:47:11] gets the money of the Jews tied up. When
[1:47:14] he does that, oh my my my, he's called
[1:47:17] the antichrist until the end of the
[1:47:19] church age, for he his children are
[1:47:22] called uh are against Christ and the
[1:47:24] word. This man's called the antichrist.
[1:47:28] Now he's going to hold the money and
[1:47:31] that's where I think he'll come in. He
[1:47:34] called the he is called the antichrist
[1:47:36] and we c and will be called the
[1:47:38] antichrist in the sight of God until the
[1:47:40] end time. But then he be called
[1:47:43] something else. The antichrist is going
[1:47:46] to change into the beast himself. And he
[1:47:49] will incarnate.
[1:47:52] Yes. Amen. Going to be incarnate in a
[1:47:55] man. Just like God is going to be
[1:47:58] incarnate in a bride.
[1:48:01] Hallelujah.
[1:48:04] Can't you see it?
[1:48:07] It's just as simple as could be.
[1:48:13] Paragraph 359. Now, when he gets the
[1:48:16] money all under
[1:48:21] control, that he'll break this covenant
[1:48:23] with the Jews. And Daniel here said he
[1:48:25] would do it in the midst of the last
[1:48:27] half of the 70th week of Daniel. Then,
[1:48:29] brother, what will he do? He will have
[1:48:31] all of the world trade and commerce of
[1:48:33] packed with the world because he will
[1:48:35] hold the wealth of the world completely.
[1:48:38] And during that time, then two prophets
[1:48:40] will rise on the screen, call 144,000.
[1:48:43] Then what will take place? Then the mark
[1:48:45] of the beast in Revelations 13 will set
[1:48:48] in because it holds all the commerce,
[1:48:50] trade, and everything out of the world.
[1:48:52] And what will take place then? The mark
[1:48:54] of the beast will come in that no man
[1:48:56] can buy or sell except that it has the
[1:48:58] mark of the beast. Thank God the church
[1:49:01] will be enjoying uh three and a half
[1:49:04] years in glory. You don't have to go
[1:49:06] through that.
[1:49:08] Hallelujah.
[1:49:10] I'll tell you what. Let me have my
[1:49:12] judgment now because it's a self
[1:49:14] judgment. So man, so let a man judge
[1:49:17] himself. Let him eat of that cup and
[1:49:19] drink of that that bread. Let him eat of
[1:49:21] the spiritual bread of this end time.
[1:49:24] Hallelujah. Do you catch it?
[1:49:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:30] Never before
[1:49:32] have we seen so many prophecies coming
[1:49:34] to pass just like it was in the first
[1:49:37] coming of Christ.
[1:49:39] This is the day of the revealing of the
[1:49:41] son of man.
[1:49:44] Amen. This is the day of the finished
[1:49:46] cycle.
[1:49:48] This is the day where we shall see him
[1:49:51] face to face.
[1:49:53] This is the day of the unveiling of God.
[1:49:56] Amen.
[1:49:58] John 14 29 says, "And I have told you
[1:50:03] before it come to pass. When it comes to
[1:50:06] pass, you might believe."
[1:50:09] See, that's what prophets do. That's it.
[1:50:11] I tell you before,
[1:50:14] do you you see it's foretelling a future
[1:50:16] event. This isn't here ye my people. I
[1:50:19] will bless you. If you seek my name, I
[1:50:21] will pour out my Ah, stop that. That's
[1:50:25] right. We know God's going to bless you.
[1:50:27] If you seek him, he will bless you.
[1:50:29] Okay? He'll pour out a blessing you
[1:50:31] cannot contain. That's not repeating
[1:50:33] scripture. Foretelling a future event.
[1:50:37] Tongues prophecy foretelling future
[1:50:40] event. Then it's got to be judged. Amen.
[1:50:43] That's right. Right. Because brother
[1:50:46] Brennham said, "Okay, Brandham
[1:50:48] Tabernacle, I've let you play with these
[1:50:49] gifts all these years now. Now we're
[1:50:52] going to put it in order." So he put it
[1:50:54] in order and they they judged these
[1:50:56] gifts instead of standing up and
[1:50:59] speaking in tongues. Another one
[1:51:00] translate over here and it just went
[1:51:02] before the people. Now now he said I'm
[1:51:04] going to put them in the back room
[1:51:07] and he says uh and we're going to check
[1:51:09] it out and okay so you spoke in tongues
[1:51:13] and you translated it. Write it down.
[1:51:16] Yeah. And you elders I want you to judge
[1:51:18] it. Was this of God or not? Yeah. We
[1:51:21] feel this is God. write your name down,
[1:51:24] then take it to the pulpit and let the
[1:51:26] pastor or one of the elders read it to
[1:51:28] the church. Is this is this church
[1:51:30] order? That's what he said. He said,
[1:51:32] "Now take that and judge it." And he
[1:51:35] says, "If it doesn't come to pass, he
[1:51:38] said those that spoke in tongues that
[1:51:41] translated and the elders need to step
[1:51:43] down because they got a they got a
[1:51:46] deceiving spirit." How many of the
[1:51:49] ministers around the world that have
[1:51:51] said thus sayaith the Lord this or that
[1:51:54] is going to happen and it didn't happen.
[1:51:56] Did they step down?
[1:52:03] I'm saying that when brother Brennham
[1:52:05] put Brennham Tabernacle in order, guess
[1:52:07] what? Junior Jackson and Don Riddle,
[1:52:10] we're out of here.
[1:52:12] They felt that brother Brenham grieved
[1:52:14] the Holy Spirit. Yeah. And and then they
[1:52:18] have the fight between the deacons. You
[1:52:19] remember that? Brother Brenham's deacons
[1:52:22] were calling them dead birds that had
[1:52:24] left. You remember that? It's all it's
[1:52:26] all on tape. And brother Bram said, "Now
[1:52:30] you, Junior Jackson believes this
[1:52:33] message as much as I do. Leave him
[1:52:35] alone. If he wants tongues and
[1:52:37] interpretation of gifts in his church,
[1:52:40] that's his problem." Amen. Huh? I
[1:52:44] remember a brother over in Zimbabwe. I
[1:52:46] was preaching for him and they had
[1:52:50] tongues and interpretation all the time.
[1:52:52] Seemed like every other service they had
[1:52:54] somebody stand up speak. He said, "Well,
[1:52:56] brother Ron, over here in uh Zimbabwe,
[1:52:59] we we just preach the pure word. We
[1:53:01] don't have these false spirits coming in
[1:53:03] here." And he I told him, I said, "You
[1:53:05] better do it the way Brother Brim said
[1:53:07] do it or you're going to get something
[1:53:08] to come in here one of these times."
[1:53:10] Well, it wound up that he said, "No,
[1:53:12] we're going to have it in the church."
[1:53:14] Well, I think the next weekend somebody
[1:53:16] stood up and spoke in tongues. And
[1:53:19] another translating said, "Hear ye
[1:53:21] people, your pastors in
[1:53:25] adultery." Ah, we're stopping all the
[1:53:27] gifts now. I tell you what, there's
[1:53:29] something coming in here and uh and
[1:53:31] everything. So, we ain't going to hear
[1:53:32] none of that.
[1:53:36] And he left that church and went
[1:53:37] somewhere else.
[1:53:40] Anyway, I don't believe in nonsense. Do
[1:53:43] you? I believe God is God.
[1:53:47] And I believe that this prophet began to
[1:53:49] show us things. Musicians, if you come,
[1:53:51] I'm I'm closing. Types and shadows are
[1:53:54] happening all around us. I didn't play
[1:53:56] all this stuff here for you to, you
[1:53:58] know, hey,
[1:54:00] listen. The Pope got elected. He's
[1:54:02] there. He's from the United States. Now
[1:54:04] what?
[1:54:06] Come on. Huh? It ain't changing my
[1:54:08] viewpoint. I'm I'm not no more serious
[1:54:11] than I was the week before. I just say,
[1:54:15] [Applause]
[1:54:17] hallelujah. We're we're closer than I
[1:54:19] thought.
[1:54:21] Amen. I think we're close. We're very,
[1:54:24] very close. So,
[1:54:28] we're seeing two kingdoms in conflict.
[1:54:31] Understand this right now. This is the
[1:54:33] God of this evil age
[1:54:36] is rising up and all those whose names
[1:54:39] are not written in the lamb's book of
[1:54:42] life will what? Be deceived. That's
[1:54:45] right. Even foolish virgin who doesn't
[1:54:49] have the token.
[1:54:57] They're going to be left behind,
[1:54:59] hunted down,
[1:55:01] persecuted,
[1:55:03] killed,
[1:55:05] martyed,
[1:55:08] all that poor little foolish lady
[1:55:10] doesn't have enough gumption to judge
[1:55:13] herself now.
[1:55:15] But when she realizes she's been left
[1:55:17] behind and they see all this stuff
[1:55:20] coming in, she'll have to give her life.
[1:55:22] Yeah.
[1:55:24] Amen. Because without the shedding of
[1:55:27] blood, there is no remission of sin. And
[1:55:29] guess what? When that last one comes in,
[1:55:32] the days of Gentile is over. And guess
[1:55:35] what? Blood leaves the mercy seat.
[1:55:40] It's over.
[1:55:42] Not be another Gentile
[1:55:44] saved. Even in white throne
[1:55:48] judgment. Watch this now. Foolish
[1:55:50] virgin. I want to ask you a question.
[1:55:53] Why did sheep wind up with goats at the
[1:55:57] end time at white throne judgment?
[1:56:00] They're sheep. They're his.
[1:56:03] But they were foolish. Amen.
[1:56:08] To believe all that the prophet had
[1:56:09] said. They didn't get the token.
[1:56:13] The token. What is the token? The Holy
[1:56:15] Ghost to lead you and guide you into all
[1:56:17] the truth.
[1:56:20] Amen. Foolish virgin. is going to wind
[1:56:23] up at white throne judgment. And they
[1:56:27] asked, "Well, brother
[1:56:28] Renham, are they going to be saved?"
[1:56:30] "Oh, yes, of course they're saved."
[1:56:34] He said, "Well, they do they get saved
[1:56:35] at white throne judgment?" He said,
[1:56:37] "No."
[1:56:39] That's when the sentencing,
[1:56:42] but because they were sheep,
[1:56:47] do you understand? They were born again.
[1:56:50] Born again. Here's doctrinal
[1:56:53] teaching. The new birth is not the
[1:56:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:59] It's not the adoption.
[1:57:02] Now, Brother Bram says in the seven
[1:57:04] church age book, he says, "We all know
[1:57:07] that the new birth and being born again
[1:57:10] or the new birth and baptism of the Holy
[1:57:12] Ghost are one and the
[1:57:14] same." Direct quote.
[1:57:17] So that looks like oh the new birth is
[1:57:20] the infilling of the Holy
[1:57:22] Ghost. Brother Ram said now I know
[1:57:25] that's going to create a lot of
[1:57:26] confusion. So for the next three pages,
[1:57:29] three pages he says let me tell you what
[1:57:33] I believe it means. And he says the
[1:57:37] modernists and the fundamentals they
[1:57:39] believe this and this and when you
[1:57:41] accept Christ and you're born again you
[1:57:44] get the Holy Ghost. He said, "No, no,
[1:57:45] no, no, no,
[1:57:47] no." Cuz he goes through the scriptures
[1:57:49] in Hebrews. Though he were born a son,
[1:57:52] an heir to all things, he must go
[1:57:55] through a time of tutors and governors
[1:57:58] to prove whether or not he's a true son
[1:58:01] or not to hear ye him.
[1:58:06] You follow that? Amen.
[1:58:08] All of the
[1:58:09] quotes and I bear you to record even
[1:58:14] after the opening of the seals. Brother
[1:58:16] Brennham, will all born again believers
[1:58:19] go in the
[1:58:21] rapture? If the new birth is the Holy
[1:58:24] Ghost, Brother Brennham answers these
[1:58:27] questions incorrectly. Right. Yes. Go.
[1:58:31] Hey, get into your books. Come on. Get
[1:58:34] into your table.
[1:58:37] You check it out. You find out
[1:58:41] cuz brother Brennham says, "I'll tell
[1:58:44] you." He says, "Water, blood, spirit,
[1:58:49] justification, sanctification." He said,
[1:58:51] "Baptism of the Holy Spirit produces the
[1:58:54] new birth."
[1:58:57] Born again, there's really been a change
[1:59:00] in me.
[1:59:03] You're now a new babe,
[1:59:08] born again,
[1:59:10] but are you going to be a true son?
[1:59:13] Are you going to do what you know to do?
[1:59:16] What does your report card say from your
[1:59:18] tutors and governors? Oh, they don't
[1:59:21] come to church very much.
[1:59:25] They wear the worldly fashion. They
[1:59:28] paint their nails. They cut their hair.
[1:59:31] They wear their high heels.
[1:59:35] [Music]
[1:59:38] It's like a brother in South Africa
[1:59:40] asked me. He said, "Are those people
[1:59:42] listening to the same tapes we're
[1:59:43] listening to?"
[1:59:45] I said, "They're listening, but they're
[1:59:47] not hearing."
[1:59:50] You judge yourself this morning.
[1:59:53] I will tell you, I'm going to say a very
[1:59:55] bold statement. Chances
[1:59:58] are the very life you are living right
[2:00:01] now at this very moment will be the life
[2:00:04] you're living when he comes. Think about
[2:00:07] that.
[2:00:09] If you're compromising,
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:14] if you're not doing all the word of God
[2:00:16] right now, chances are you won't do it
[2:00:19] when he comes. In other words, you're
[2:00:21] foolish. And I'm not trying to make
[2:00:23] everybody wise because you can't. He
[2:00:26] said in every church are how many kinds
[2:00:28] of believers?
[2:00:31] True believer make believer unbeliever.
[2:00:34] But you manifest out of your life which
[2:00:38] one you are. God help me to manifest
[2:00:43] the word of God as a true believer.
[2:00:46] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:52] The last quote here, the God of this
[2:00:54] evil
[2:00:55] age. Now, God telling us here in the
[2:00:58] last days that the God of this world
[2:01:00] will rise up in the last days. Whosoever
[2:01:03] shall add one word to it, take one word
[2:01:05] from
[2:01:06] it. His part taken from the book of
[2:01:09] life. Notice from the book of life, not
[2:01:12] lamb's book of life. Because those who
[2:01:15] got the Holy Ghost are in the lamb's
[2:01:18] book of life, not the book of life.
[2:01:21] Everyone's in the book of life. Good,
[2:01:24] bad, seed, non
[2:01:30] seed. Strange now after some 1900 years
[2:01:34] of the gospel preaching and now she that
[2:01:37] world system is more evil in the days
[2:01:41] when that when he was here. The world
[2:01:44] system is more evil. The world is
[2:01:46] heading to a great climax. You know that
[2:01:50] the Lord is fulfilling his word on every
[2:01:53] hand. Amen.
[2:01:58] Amen. Now, we
[2:02:00] can say all kinds of
[2:02:04] things. We can show you current events.
[2:02:08] We can show you that this prophet was
[2:02:11] right. He's prophesied these things. We
[2:02:14] see them coming to
[2:02:16] pass. What are you going to do with it?
[2:02:20] Good question. Oh, okay.
[2:02:28] So, it's up to you. What are you going
[2:02:29] to do with it? Yes.
[2:02:32] What did the message do to you? Yeah.
[2:02:36] Has it changed you? Has it caused you to
[2:02:40] get more in love with God? Or are you
[2:02:42] just kind of just going along? You young
[2:02:45] people, you listen to me. Old people
[2:02:47] also.
[2:02:50] Don't play with this. Amen.
[2:02:56] It's going home time.
[2:02:58] How much longer do we have? Months?
[2:03:01] Years? I don't know. All I say is all of
[2:03:04] this this America is rising up. She's
[2:03:07] going to She starts like a lamb.
[2:03:11] She's going to end like a dragon.
[2:03:13] This
[2:03:15] system will start killing people.
[2:03:19] You wait until
[2:03:21] the peel horse rider
[2:03:25] rides and death and hell follow him.
[2:03:33] This whole world is going to go insane.
[2:03:35] They'll kill you thinking they're doing
[2:03:38] God a service because their God tells
[2:03:41] them. Anybody that doesn't agree with
[2:03:43] us, we'll put them just like 68 million
[2:03:46] in the time of the Reformation.
[2:03:49] Huh? Imagine that.
[2:03:51] Yeah. Cuz who's who's who's going to
[2:03:54] stand up for you?
[2:03:56] No. You better make your stand now. You
[2:03:59] better know what you believe cuz we're
[2:04:01] we're getting out of here one of these
[2:04:03] days, saints. Hey, I'm excited. Let's
[2:04:06] all stand together. God bless you this
[2:04:08] morning. Thank you. I'm sorry it's a
[2:04:10] little bit of a different service. I
[2:04:12] didn't really preach. I wanted to show
[2:04:13] you some things. Showing you that this
[2:04:16] image that we're we are presently in
[2:04:21] United States of
[2:04:22] America. It's an image unto the beast.
[2:04:26] Amen. And looks like it's innocent and
[2:04:30] it's okay.
[2:04:32] and our president saying, "Hey, I I love
[2:04:34] the Catholic. I love the Catholic
[2:04:36] Church." Well, I I can't wait to go meet
[2:04:39] the
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:43] Pope. Thank God, saints of God, we're
[2:04:45] not going to see this tribulation.
[2:04:48] The tribulation you're seeing right now
[2:04:50] is between you and God. Got all kinds of
[2:04:53] turmoil, troubles, this and that. Man,
[2:04:55] make it right. Let's go. Huh? Yeah. I
[2:04:59] don't want to be here. That's right.
[2:05:02] God help me. I don't want to be here. I
[2:05:03] don't want to see these two witnesses.
[2:05:06] No, I've seen the one witness. Malachi
[2:05:09] 4, Revelation 10:7. Amen. He said, "Get
[2:05:13] ready. He's coming."
[2:05:15] Amen. We are the generation. We're the
[2:05:18] culmination. Brother Robert, help me
[2:05:19] out.
[2:05:21] Amen.
[2:05:23] And we are the
[2:05:29] generation. We're
[2:05:31] the nation. The final voice the world
[2:05:37] will hear. The coming of the Lord is
[2:05:43] near. Living out the
[2:05:49] revelation.
[2:05:50] Overcoming sins,
[2:05:53] temptation. The truth will come through
[2:05:56] every tongue and
[2:06:03] nation. We are
[2:06:08] Amen. Sing it with confidence and a
[2:06:10] declaration. We are the
[2:06:12] generation. We are the generation.
[2:06:20] With the
[2:06:22] promination, the final voice the world
[2:06:26] will hear. The coming of the Lord is
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:34] nearly the
[2:06:37] revelation. Overcome the
[2:06:41] sins of truth.

[2:12:43] Amen. Amen. And let's bow our heads this
[2:12:45] morning as we get ready to dismiss.
[2:12:48] Heavenly
[2:12:49] Father, today we
[2:12:52] heard current events. We heard the
[2:12:55] prophet's voice that is still speaking
[2:12:59] the truth.
[2:13:01] And we heard a prophecy that is being
[2:13:04] fulfilled right before our eyes. And
[2:13:07] Lord, we put our lives in your hands.
[2:13:09] And that's the best place to put our
[2:13:11] lives in because you know just what we
[2:13:14] have need of
[2:13:17] when we're weak and feeble. You carry us
[2:13:20] along life's road. That's when there was
[2:13:22] one set of footprints in the S. You were
[2:13:26] carrying us. And Lord, we say thank you
[2:13:28] for those times when you're carrying us
[2:13:29] in your hands cuz we trust in you. We
[2:13:33] ask you to bless brother Ron. We ask you
[2:13:35] to bless our visitors today. We bless
[2:13:37] ask you bless the sick and the
[2:13:38] afflicted, Lord. The ones that we had
[2:13:40] prayer for, Lord, will you touch each of
[2:13:42] those needs today. Will you bless the
[2:13:44] moms today on Mother's Day, Lord, we
[2:13:46] thank you for a godly
[2:13:50] mom that lives a Christian life. The
[2:13:53] fifth gospel has been referred to so
[2:13:56] many times, the mother of the home, the
[2:14:00] preacher of the home, the fifth gospel.
[2:14:01] We thank you for the moms. We ask you to
[2:14:03] bless them today and we love you and we
[2:14:05] praise you. And everyone said, "Amen."
[2:14:07] Remember the service Wednesday night.
[2:14:09] We'd like all moms to go through the
[2:14:10] main doors this morning, the sanctuary

[2:14:27] from the church to you. And as we go
[2:14:29] this morning, I'm glad I was in the
[2:14:31] presence of the Lord. Made me glad. St.
[2:14:33] Key made me glad. Some from Psalms 34.
[2:14:36] It says, "I
[2:14:38] will bless the
[2:14:40] Lord
[2:14:42] forever." Made me
[2:14:45] glad and I
[2:14:48] will trust him at all times. He has He
[2:14:55] has And he
[2:14:59] has delivered me from all
[2:15:05] fear. And he
[2:15:09] has set my feet upon the
[2:15:16] rock and I will not be moved.
[2:15:22] I'll say the Lord, you are my
[2:15:28] shield, my strength,
