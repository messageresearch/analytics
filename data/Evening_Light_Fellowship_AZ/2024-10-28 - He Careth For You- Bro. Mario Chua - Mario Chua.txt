right so we're so thankful and grateful Lord that once again we come before your throne expecting Lord that you will come and Minister once again into our needs Lord You're so mindful Lord of our needs Lord then thank you we just pray that you will once again manifest your faithfulness in our me Lord and so we want to remember the PS and family Lord that may just give peace and comfort Lord in this time the need Lord so once again we commit the service into thy presence in Jesus wonderful name amen amen amen can we say praise to the Lord this morning praise the Lord amen just like what David said I I'm so glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord amen and before we go to the word this morning I would like to say thank you to all who gave their appreciation card last Sunday and haven't got a chance to say thank you last Wednesday because I was not here so thank you very much for all those who gave their cards and just a word of encouragement is enough for us to continue to give us the inspiration amen amen it's hard to stand in the Pulpit sometimes we you we don't when you don't know if they are blessed or not but just one word is enough thank you Lord uh to know that we are on the same page amen amen so I would like to uh take this time just a little thought and a simple thought this morning and I would like to title this sermon uh he carth for you thank you Lord maybe this will not be the sermon that you expect for me to preach that you can jam and Shout or so is just a simple thought this morning and uh I believe that whatever things that God put in our heart as a minister God somebody may need it amen even though how simple it is that's true amen because we know that we are living in the Lan age although God sent a messenger in our day to come out of this Lan age which is miserable and naked and they don't know it and lukewarmness although we heard the voice and we come out from the system but we can still be affected by that system that's right just like Sarah and Abraham they come out amen they they're not from Sodom but they can still feel the effect of Sodom condition so that's why in this last days we are living in in total darkness so we are although we are already recognizing our but still in this place we are still bombarded by all kinds of uh discouragement trials after trial testing after testing and sometimes we can wonder if still God is still caring for us so turn with me in the Book of John Chapter 14 verse one thank you musician God bless you and all the song special I and I believe the song special is also a Min minister to each and every one of us amen John chap 14 verse1 to three just a simple thought and I believe that uh just helped me to deliver it so when I brother uh brother stepen and I talk a while ago that are you still nervous brother Mario still I am still sometimes when we try to study too much sometime we cannot get it because we are depending our on our ability but when when we just relax and thank you Lord and leave it unto the Lord and I told brother stepen we don't stand in the Pulpit to entertain people that's if God gave us a message if just only for one soul that is enough because one soul is equivalent to 10,000 Soul so praise God maybe this is for somebody Lord and God knows who it is John chapter 14 1-3 says let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me so the cure for a troubled heart is to believe the Lord amen amen in my my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you thank you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that is the promise of God Amen in this second coming he come to receive his bride that where I am there ye may be also praise the Lord and turn with me in 1 Peter chap 5 verse 5-7 it says likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yeah and all of you be subject one to another and be cloth with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth Grace to The Humble amen humble yourselves therefore un the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your cares upon Him for he carth for you may the Lord add a blessing upon reading this word you may now be seated amen we believe that uh and the prophet explained that a person is a uh is a three in three banners we have uh the flesh man the spirit man and the Soul amen and we know that we as a born again we recognize that we are already Sons and Daughters of God we are already being converted but likewise the trial and testing still comes amen because we haven't changed yet we we are waiting for the transforming of our bodies so we are uh uh we are under our testings and trials amen so every day we are facing a lot of troubles trial discouragement sometime desperations are all kind of sours that Satan is trying to discourage us that's right on our journey to the promised land amen and often we find ourselves in the midst of troubles and toyss of life and it can be of those time that we could maybe question within ourselves if God really cares for us so we may not even think that on our mind but deep down we can have these little doubts and disappointment and question as if they really if he really does care for us as he say he does because it seems like to our natural way of thinking that if he truly cares for us then he would have diverted us away from the toil and storms that life can throw our way true that is in the human speaking in our experience amen and I believe each and every one of us have been through that kind of trial that sometimes in our deep trial sometimes we question God if he really cares for us because sometimes there we we we don't recognize the acts and the ways of God cu the acts is different from his ways just like when God revealed to Moses his ways and he reveals to Israel his acts so his act is that he is a Healer he is a redeemer he is a way maker but sometime we mistook his ways into his Acts or we don't recognize his ways from his acts sometimes just like we have sickness and sometimes we believe his acts as a Healer we believe it but some sometimes his ways is different so we need to recognize his ways from acts because if we don't recognize his ways from his act sometimes we get discouraged and sometimes we question is he really cares for us and even the disciples did the same same thing so turn with me in the in the The Book of Mark chapter 4 and even the disciples question if he really cares for us so in Mark chapter 4:34 it says but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples and if we read the whole Mark uh uh chapter 4 it speaks about the parable of the S so we will not read all those scripture will just jump to 34 it says but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples so we see we we will notice the difference between his public Teaching Ministry and his private Teaching Ministry amen so his private teaching min Ministry is to expound the word to his disciples but without the parable he spake unto them not so we believe that he is still the same yesterday today and forever amen and we recognize his presence that's why this ministry is expounding the word that was sealed before the foundation of the word is expounding into this generation so that is the difference because this ministry of Malachi 4 is personally to the elect in these last days because I will send to you Elijah the prophet so this is to a specific people in these last days amen this ministry of Belia is not for everybody but only for you which was described in Malachi chap 4 and if this prophecy there must be a people to fulfill fill that prophecy so in other words we are called the people of the prophecy if there is a prophecy there must be a people to manifest that prophecy but then we are not different we are still have trials and testing and sometimes we get discouraged and sometimes we get desperation that's right that's why if we lack prayers we lack reading the word that's why sometimes we wonder why troubles come in so that's why John in the Book of Revelation said blessed are they that read the word amen so if you feel you don't you are not blessed just read the word that's right because he said blessed are they that read the word and if you cannot read the word you can still hear the word that's right amen and I believe that if you read the word God will come on the scene and expound to to you his word because that is his private Ministry to the Bride of Jesus Christ and verse 35 and the same day when even was come he said unto them so he's giving them a promise let us pass over unto the other side and the same day when the even was come so even was the evening time and we are now in the evening time and we have the promise to cross over to pass over into the other land amen hallelujah just like Noah he's from the other world he passed through the other world Moses from Egypt to the Red Sea he's passing over to another land amen Joshua from Jordan River he's passing to another land Enoch is passing into another land and we are promised this last day that we will we will pass into the other land from Mortal to immortality that is the promise of God hallelujah thank you Lord so in this story here's showing something of our life because in this story we see that he was going to be with them not only he promised because the one who made the promise is the one who will fulfill the promise that's right when he made the promise he didn't promise them to be alone he's going with them so that's why the promise for us I will be with you even and to the end of the world and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other ships and there arose a great storm of winds and waves bit into the ship so that it was now full so the great storm when your boat is full of water in great storm and wind and waves and sea spray in pit black at night you don't get a lot worse situation than that and many of must find ourself in this places while on our journey of Life between this two world Amen one way or another we can experience the worst part in our life maybe you are in a worse part of your journey this morning and sometimes you question go did God really cares on because you only recognize his acts if I am in that situation I know God Will Make A Way because that was his acts but we need to recognize his ways amen during trouble times not only his act because we know that God can make anything because he was God he but we we need to know his ways and when he was and when he was in the hinder part of the ship so the hinder part is in the back part of the ship but at least he was in the ship right and sometimes in times of trouble we can find that some is God is not with us is God is leaving me no he was in the hinder part of the ch he never leave you when he promised he is in that promise and whatever situation we are in he never let go of himself he is still there in the hinder part hallelujah thank you he never leave you nor forsake you amen amen but we need to realize his ways yes Hallelujah he was in the hinder part of the sheep asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say master carest thou not that we perish the same question when trouble time comes sometimes they even the disciples ask him are you caring for us so notice how they when they were faced with such this Spirit situation the first thing they did was question his care for them right carest thou not that we perish he cared for them more than they could ever know that's right there was no human being on earth that could have ever cared for for them any more than this man did because he was God himself who had come down on Earth and became men all because of this great and careful love of them and us thank you Lord for while we were yet sinners Christ died for us and he who knows no sin becomes sin that we might become his very righteousness he cares so much about us amen HJ Hallelujah so and he said unto him why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith so here Jesus identifies the reason of their fear and that because their lack of faith right in his promises that he made to them in that he said they would get to the other side that was already done it was already finished amen that's right let us pass over into the other land you cannot add to it or take away from it god require us to believe the promise let us pass over into the other land but they when when desparation when circumstances arise they question he SC because they are looking at his AXS but they haven't recognized his ways yet right so that's why that's why that's why Jesus cried how is it that you have no faith so Jesus identified the reason of Their Fear was because lack of faith in his promises that he made to them in that he said they would go to the other side he already spoken the word let us pass on the other side and the Very one who made the promise was also in the boat with them because when God promised he will be the one to make manifest that promise but instead of believing and having confidence in that his word would never fail instead they doubted the word and questioned his care for them I think we are living in reality of our experience in life yeah these are the same disciple that had witnessed the supernatural of the healing revivals and miracles and everything and witness the teachings the Revival in his day they see the acts of the supernatural of the healings of the Miracles even by the way he he preached the doctrine in the church they recognized when when Trouble Comes they question his care for them just like in our journey recognize sometimes the presence of God we can shout sometimes we can cry and we recognize praise God the supernatural the acts of God in our lives but sometimes we cannot understand his way sometimes we doubt because we cannot understand his ways his act is different from his ways and sometimes we question is he really cares for us amen in Mark 4 11 verse 12 he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables in the public the secret things is hidden but to each and every one of us it was given expounded but yet when trouble come they question the cares of God sometimes it's hard to Gras the ways of God Amen because we know his acts he can heal he can perform Miracles but we are not limited to his acts that's why Jesus Christ said I am the way the truth and the life and his ways are higher than our ways and his thought are higher than all thoughts so that's why we cannot figure out God we just need to believe by faith in his promises of God whatever things that he will do he will perform it according to his ways not according to our ways oh we can figure out what the next thing to do amen so we just need to walk by faith and seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand less any time they should be converted and their sins could be forgiven so unless you are being being converted you cannot understand the message of the hour so that's why Jesus Christ said you need to be born again you must be born again receive the Holy Spirit and when the Holy Spirit Come he will guide you into all truth that is why the prophet of God in this told us that Revelation is more important to you than what you realize so Revelation is important amen we may know all the scripture we may know all the message but unless God revealed to you his ways amen we will continue to question his care so we know that revelation of the word is just a simple clear understanding given to you by G of the meaning of the word of what God's original thought of it is because Revelation is the thought of God given to you thank you Lord once the Revelation is is given to you then you will know that it was the thought of God Amen in other words the same thought of what was in God's mind is now in your mind also amen that's it is the very thought of God by the word of God regarding a certain truth being made clear to your mind by works of the inner teacher amen when you receive the Holy Ghost it will be an inside teacher in your heart thank you this is what God has done for us who are his disciple is bright in this day through the voice of the seventh angel give us the Revelation those mystery that was hidden before the foundation of the word is now open and what was in the back part of God's mind before the world was ever created was now in the bride amen praise the Lord so we have seen him in this end time in the revealing of the son of man Ministry for those of us who are in uh in the message of the hour we have marel at things he has done in our time in the ministry of the Prophet just as disciple and followers marveled in the things they saw him do at the time of this Corporal Ministry and just as they knew he was them in the boat we know full well that he is with us in the boat in this hour because he is the same yesterday today and forever he never leave us hallelujah that is the Assurance we will go or pass to another land that is his Assurance Jen may have felt well just we know full well that he's with us in the boat because he's the same yesterday today he promised that he would never leave us nor forsake us and thank you Lord for that promises amen hallelujah when John the Baptist was in the prison house under herod's judgment we know that John also questioned God's care for him you know that John the Baptist for run the first coming of Christ amen he was so bold to rebuke herod's wife amen and he when he was put in prison now Trouble Comes J may have felt like God had abandoned him in his prison house why I introduced Jesus Christ I saw the spirit of God coming down and I heard the voice this is my beloved Son in whom I dwell dwell pleased but now I am in prison and he is not coming I don't know if what my my Ministry is real or no if he is the real Messiah and he felt maybe he don't cares right and so he had become offended because of the storm of his life it looked to John like God didn't care for him anymore because he had seemingly left him in the prison to R but we know that God did care for him for we know that John did arrive safely on the other side amen for the believer's death only makes way for you to arrive safely on the other side amen so in Romans 9:32 and 33 he said wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by works of the law for they stumble at that stumbling block as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling block stumbling stone and a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen so Jesus was referred to as the rock of offense if you lack Faith or Revelation in him and his promises then his ways of dealing with you could become offensive right and cause you to stumbled I serve God why he didn't do this why he didn't save me why we can questions about that because it is easy for people to become offended at God in the ways of dealing with us because of how we humans sometime misunderstand God's higher ways of thinking concerning us amen we think that his care should be to protect us from all trouble so that we without never be in we will never encoun aaging storms in life not realizing that it is this very storm of life that is care for us is truly revealed and made manifest that's right amen praise God so that's why Peter and 4 chapter chapter 4: 1213 he said beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though you strange thing happened to you but rejoice as much as ye are partakers of Christ suffering amen that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy amen if life was just one big smooth sailing from sea to shining sea then we would never really come to know his great love and care for us so in the message he cared for you where brother Bram got this inspiration when he preached he got this experience in his life that he was so down and he said that for 33 years of his ministry he come closest to just giving in to Satan he was in his lowest of his life so in the message he carried for you he said that standing y in the hospital when I come the closest of my 30 years of ministry clam come the closest of ever giving to Satan that must be very very hard trials in the life of the Prophet for 33 years of his ministry he come closest to giving in to Satan when my little girl Sharon Rose was dying in the hospital I stood there and the doctor didn't even know I was in the room he would let me go in because he said meaning J he said Billy you'll give it to Billy Jr would go he said and he said set me down he told me and the nurse said go get some medicine and give him she come out with little glass about that high and said take this brother bham and he said just sit down and I watched her till she got out of the room and down through the hole I went and down into the basement brother bam is struggling during the time he saw his wife died and now her daughter is dying with mintis and there lay my baby laying there with flies in his ey a little mosquito bar of thing over the top of his face it kick it off and I look over to the little fellow mothers laying in the mors and some sometimes we are in the situations like this troubles after troubl trouble there trouble there just like job yes there is a messeng coming oh your your your all your livestocks already died there after just maybe a few minutes then all your livelihood that trials after trials and this if did happened to job it happened to brother Brenham amen and he said that I must I I I was closest to giving in to Satan and I look over Little P my mother lay in the morning her little brother Billy in hospital seriously sick and my father had just died on my arms a few weeks before and my brother killed instantly what a tragedy if you look at in the physical and we will really question God if he really the prophet of God his father died his brother died instantly now his wife died now he's not to die and if there was I mean nothing but a boy preaching and I look over at her and I look and said oh Sharon honey this is dy do you know me and I know she know me she was trying to look like wave goodbye to me and her little eye was crossing she was suffering so hard I could see those little blue eye Crossing and then I look at her and I feel on my knee and I said God her mama lays young in the mor and we're so bury him bury her in the morning don't take my baby Lord let me raise her she's so sweet don't care Lord just then look like like black come unfolding just shut up the vision from her and take her anyhow and raise up you are petitioning God with all your heart with all your mind and with all your soul believing that God Will Make A Way because you preach God that is a Healer preach God that is a deliverer but there was a time that even God Is So silen and brother Bram is struggling in his spirit and then Satan come to my sight remember Satan is faithful in his duty that's right he will do everything to hinder us to discourage us Amen to to disappoint us he is always in the Sin and even in this congregation he is in the Sin maybe the preacher is preaching and he's saying something you don't listen to that preacher his accent I cannot understand his accent he don't know how to speak English if God is here he's always here thank you because he is always on the opposite side so and then Satan come to come to my side and he said and then you serve him is questioning the same as he questioned you when you are in trouble are you really the son of God are you really a daughter of God because Satan knows the act of God I know God Is A Healer I know God is a miracle worker I know God is a redeemer but why didn't he heal your daughter your wife your father why there's always a question question and he's good at questioning that's right and then you observe him here you are nothing but a okay and then you serve him here you are nothing but a boy and you mean what have you done stood on the street corner everywhere you could and fasted till you was so weak you couldn't climb a telephone poll to do your work and have you done but preach and cried and pray come on it seems that he was encouraging him when you are still a boy you preach from corner that when you're fasting and you preach he's he's good at manipulating words that's right you pasted till you was weak you could climb telephone pole to do your work and have you done but preached and cried and prayed and one word from here would change the whole picture but would he do do it just like how he temp Eve you may eat all the trees of the of the garden but surely you will not die so he's still this questioning the same and one word from him would change the whole picture but would he do it no he won't do it he let her die and then you'll turn around serve him come almost so Satan is teasing him yeah amen so when my leg wouldn't hold me up no longer I lean on the bed and I said Sher you know Daddy hear her wishing like and she had looked like she was dying and I thought just one word he wouldn't have to even speak he just looked his own mind would just change the picture and the meaning Jus would leave her and she'll be well just one word but he won't do it so look at how he is munding the care of God this is a hard thing to understand amen just one word being a prophet being a servant of God he can say God lord I am your servant I do everything that in my in my strength to do your will but just this one Lord just speak just one word but God is silence and Satan said then you'll continue to serve him this is the time when brother bam struggled so much that he said this is the closest thing in his life that he try to it's almost try to give in to Satan right and I thought where would I go right amen what could I do or who could I go to and where's my hope something happened to me I said a few years ago down here and I know that I love him amen that's your anchor to know that you love him to know and recognize that he loves you and in return you love him that's the real thing that's the anchor of our so I walk over to the bed and put my hands on my little little head and I said darling God gave you and God's taking you away blessed be the name of the Lord amen though you slay me yet I'll Trust you yes sir I'll take you darling and lay on your mother's arm Y in The Undertaker's mors in about an hour from now but yet if he kills me there's nothing I can go to he's the only hope that I ever found he's the only foundation he's the only comfort that I ever had and where I could go now for Comfort if it wasn't to him and when I said that the angel come and pack her away and I just almost collapsed but something happened he was my confort he came to me he cared for me this is where God or brother bam take his inspiration he carth for you in times of this trouble God cared so much that he took little Sharon Rose home so that he could give her to the prophet for eternity amen thank you and brother brandham saw her on the other side behind the curtain of time and he was a young beautiful woman during that time Hallelujah that could never have hurt ache or disappointment or trouble God had spared little sh rose from a little full of struggle and disappointment of this world and maybe in life she would have gone astray from the Lord but God's Great care for her amen and cared for his Prophet that is the way of God thank you Lord Abes our ways God had a purpose amen hallelujah God only knows the struggle of brother Bram but God knows Beyond those trouble there is a way Hallelujah are you older and wise in the way of life and things of God then you begin to understand more of God's Great way of care in dealing with his children Amen in order to reveal himself to you so you begin to see life in a different way when you begin to realize that you are passing through from one side to the other amen and that storm in the middle is allowed by God in order to reveal himself and his great love and cares towards you thank because he cares for you more than you could ever know he cared so much that he gave his own life but when Trouble Comes Hallelujah it show that he cares about us it's not about the supernatural that we all see in his acts but his cares is different from his acts his ways is different thank you Lord so in the message I know he said it is written in one of the scripture in the Bible the trials are brought upon us are more precious to us than God itself for it is God giving us this trial so when trial comes your way the prophet said it was God giving us these trials after we become his property we are now property of God that's right if we are married to Christ we are his amen we become his property our confession our baptism and our promises to walk in Life or him then every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory put that in mind that's right every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before trial comes amen so that's why God and trial and come so that's God will become so more real amen before the trial comes so thank you for the trials don't think that he don't care for you when he gave you trials that's his ways of showing he cares so we need to distinguish between his acts and his ways because we cannot fathom his ways we just need to go by faith because everything is order when he said I will pass over the land it's already done it's already finished but in the middle there is a trouble inside amen and he questioned them you of little faith every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for His Glory thank you Lord It's to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us that he was before the trial come I want to join this morning uh with job to say that I believe long enough to know that's the truth I have seen it in my own life that every time a great situation Rises that I can get around it or under it or over it God makes a way and comes out glorious Hallelujah whatever situation we are in right now he will always come out glorious so that's why trial and testing are bombarding and in every walks of life because God is going to prove that greater is he that is in you than is the world he was the one that will prove it so that's why he gave all the trials the testing the discouragement in life to prove his word that greater is he that is in us and this is the word hallelujah and remember all this thing Satan tries to make us nervous and upset us to get us to think oh why did this happen why would have been like this and the prophet said it is order to redeem you back to himself amen hallelujah that's why first Peter 56 our opening scripture said humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in you season whatever things comes our way let us not interpret it in our mind maybe this maybe that maybe this lean unto thy own understanding with all thy ways acknowledge Him and humble himself whatever things that he wants to do with us let his name be glorified amen casting all your cares upon Him for he carth for you casting all give all your burden give your problem give your anxiety give your depression give your troubles give whatever it is cast it unto him for he carth for you thank you Jesus in the message cared for you now you might heard the scripture before but let's take heed to them are they true amen because it's easy to read and even memorize but unless you experience it you cannot really appreciate it in your life now you might heard the scripture before but let's take heed to them are they true they are true than your setting in this church tonight they're more truer than this in the state of Arizona they're more truer than you are in a live human being they are God's Eternal words and his promises and all Heaven and Earth will pass away but them word shall never pass amen they have meaning meaning Sublime but they'll never meaning nothing to you until God reveals them to you and how beautiful it is to know that he cares for us then if he cares for us then we would also care for him am amen for his cause and his body of Believers on Earth just showing someone that you care for them can bring healing to their wounded spirit amen he carth for you thank you so that every Tri and testing we need to distinguish his acts and his ways when trial come don't say okay this is God you said you said you said you said but we will his ways will never know unless he reveal it something to us and I believe God is in the business of revealing himself more and more not only he is revealed word being magnified but also in our struggle in life we need to understand the struggles of life he said that just showing someone that you care for them can bring healing to their wounded spirit amen in the message he came paragraph 44 and we believe that doctors help people as the prophet said they are just instrument in helping the people I believe that God heals by medicine so Prophet is not a fanatic he believes God in everything he is so balanced because when we become fanatic of God we say that God heals all kind of diseases and somebody says always don't need medicine because God heals God Is So balanced that's and I meet some of the brothers in the Philippines that they become one-sided right they don't take medicine if they even they have toothache they believe that God heals by medicine who experience having a tooth AE woo two days three days it will swell it will get infected and because they believe that God heals and no need medicine they try to live up according to their faith I believe I believe God will heal I don't need medicine amen two three 4 days he cannot bear the pain so he took the medicine so another one they believe God don't he medicine and his daughter got the lbm they don't believe in medicine though they don't bring her to the doctor until she pass away of the hydration then another daughter do the same then he decided that he will bring it to the doctor but the prophet here said I believe that God heals my medicine and the prophet said that any sensible person if he don't feel good or he don't feel right he need to see a doctor amen you don't figure out what you feel and just say I believe God will heal me yes how can God heal you if he don't know what you feel because God is so specific so we need to see a doctor and the doctor who studied medicine will tell you what is your trouble in life if you have a cancer then he was identified then you can bring it un the presence of the Lord Am Lord I have a Cancer and you believe Lord I believe that you healed all kind of disease and I believe it and God will perform it amen amen but if you cannot identify what you feel sometimes you drink a lot of medicine according to your understanding so if instead of getting well you're getting worse so God Is So balanced thank you for the word in these last days we have a balanced God we have a balanced message we believe that doctors help people they heal when you are wounded they heal stress amen they heal you operate or something like that I believe that God heals by medicine God heals by surgery and God heals by understanding amen we need to expand our understanding because let the love of God cover all kind of sin we may say we may we may face a lot of issues face a lot of misunderstanding as brother Ron said we may be uh disagreeing certain point but it doesn't mean that we will be disagreeable with one another we need to respect one another's opinion and if we expand our understanding God can heals the broken relationship amen amen God heals by love and that love don't and we know that the love of God is agap love that is the Divine love of God Amen everyone of us has been tried and tested just like when brother Bram is preaching that before he preached there was a a a vision given to him there there will be a trap when you preach this morning and he don't know what kind of trap was that and when he start preaching there was a young couple in front of the pulpit and they are kissing one another and the prophet that was the TRU Y and the Holy Spirit told him you can say whatever you want and God will do it he can curse them he can judge them and God will do it because it was God who get the inspiration amen but it was the love of God that said I forgive you the same likewise in our situations in life Maybe maybe somebody's against us maybe our family or brothers or sisters or minister or something that we encounter and sometimes as if we cannot hold our peace and we'll just curse them you go your way I go my way if we cannot understand one another anyway as we how can to agree if they how can they walk together if they don't agree but we need to have an agapo Lev an understanding of things because everything our ways we need to know God's ways amen not only his acts but his ways because his ways is beyond our ways and his thought are beyond our thought we need to expand our understanding Beyond human reasoning that's true so that we can see God in our midst God heals by understanding God heals by love just a little goes a long way just a little love of showing you care yes just that just just like brother Ron said if you don't see anyone just give him a text hi hello how are you that's enough I remember I remember when we first got married my wife wife the first three years is that is the adjustment adjustment period you have a lot of adjustment and qu qu and sometimes we get disappointed we don't go to church we just we just hide ourselves in the house disappointed with the Ministry this everything comes Qui we just stay there don't go to chairs don't Fellowship don't want another then one day there was a knock in the door and it was our pastor he don't ask question anything he just I come to pray that's all and we are released of that bonday just little love will do it true we don't know what somebody is suffering or what he been through but a little word of encouragement amen we just lift them up and he help us during the time I so thankful hallelujah amen God heals by love God heals by prayer and we know that prayer always is the most powerful weapon along the Earth powerful than nuclear amen amen God heals by Miracle God heals by his word and God heals Hallelujah God heals by his word and we as Gentile healed by just the spoken word of God whatever Source it is God heals by it God Is A Healer yes he is and we don't know how his ways to heal it but we know he is a Healer we don't need to see his acts according to our interpretation of how how he will do it but he has his own way and the end it is his name will be glorified Among Us that's right I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases and it was declared I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases no other else no doctors no medicine that claim that we are without us they can no God already declared it so if you are in trouble this morning God declare It Whatever situation you are in God declare it he came for you more than anybody else that's why he came and died in order for you to be redeemed back to himself thank you Lord thank you Lord so all of it should work together and man in different Ministry should work together for that different Ministry in the body of Christ are placed there by God to bring healing to other portion of the body by the way how God made that Ministry to cares for others and this ministry it doesn't mean that it's only the five-fold ministry we as the body of Jesus Christ mystical body of Jesus had our own Ministry amen amen so whatever Ministry you are in make sure that the God will be glorified in it amen so shall we stand this morning just a little bit of encouragement God and I believe that uh I'm calling him musician I I I believe that just like what I said his act is different from his ways amen maybe we are expecting a long service but his way is just short service thank you enough to sustain us enough to remind us that he cares for us hallelujah he just came down this morning to declare cast all your cares upon Him don't be discouraged don't be dismay amen don't be in depression because he cares so much for you than more than anybody else thank you Jesus Lord that's why in Philippians 4:6 be careful for nothing hold nothing in your heart but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God hold nothing because he carth for you and be and the peace of God which passit all understanding shall keep your heart minds and through Christ Jesus the word is already being spoken we will pass over on the other land Hallelujah so in the middle of our journey we are being tried we are being mold Amen to mold our character because not only on the other side but this will be in eternity that's right so our trials and testings and all that comes our way is not worthy to be compare of the glor that is waiting for us that's right remember this morning he carth for you do you care for him Hallelujah let's bow our head oh gracious Heavenly Father Lord we so thankful Lord yes we're so thankful for your love and your care for us Lord God and I know this word Lord is a word that only a short but you know where goes to Lord in the midst of sometimes Darkness on our lives and troubles and been through in this journey Lord God and sometimes we come to the point just like the brother Bram said that come to the closest to the point that he will give in to Satan but thank you Lord that you care for [Music] us help us Lord to know your ways yes Lord in our life Lord that we may not lean on our own understanding and figure out what you're going to do Lord but let your way and ways be done in our lives Lord help us Lord give us strength give us faith Lord and give us dedications Lord God to walk according to your will Lord if there is anything in our life that hinder us Lord to glorify thy name help us Lord take away our doubts unbelief disappointment in life Lord but help us Lord to be faithful yes Lord be the to your holy spirit because you care for us Lord amen thank you for your love thank you for your mercy thank you for your [Music] uncovenanted
