[47:37] when they said unto me let us go into
[47:38] the house of the Lord so in times of
[47:41] trouble in times of uh
[47:44] trials we have a place of Refuge that we
[47:48] can find rest and that is in the word of
[47:50] God Amen out there there the spirit is
[47:53] so depressing you can see a lot of
[47:56] homeless people a lot of uh things that
[48:01] will affect our spirit but in within the
[48:04] house of the Lord we can have an
[48:08] atmosphere and sitting in Heavenly
[48:10] places in Christ Jesus amen that is the
[48:13] word of God
[48:16] so uh the last service that I have I
[48:19] preach about the he is risen but I
[48:24] haven't finished it so this morning it
[48:27] seems that I will not finish
[48:29] it still because God gave me another
[48:33] Direction amen and I trust that it will
[48:36] be a blessing to each and every one of
[48:38] us amen we are living in the most
[48:40] glorious age that's
[48:44] right Hallelujah so turn with me in the
[48:47] book of
[48:50] Deuteronomy chapter
[48:52] 25 verse
[48:54] 5-6 theonomy
[48:57] it's a hard to
[49:03] pronounce are you excited this morning
[49:06] amen yeah amen so if you are excited I'm
[49:09] excited it can help me when you say you
[49:11] are
[49:13] excited amen I I I I get my strength
[49:17] from you amen because if you just look
[49:20] at me I will be so nervous but if you
[49:24] smile you say Amen it will encourage me
[49:27] amen it will help me amen as I always
[49:31] say it is always two-way right amen you
[49:34] are not just an audience spectator but
[49:37] you are part A participator amen I am
[49:42] just a waiter waiting for your
[49:45] order and willing to serve amen amen
[49:49] Deuteronomy 25 verse 5-6 it says if if
[49:55] Brethren dwell together
[49:57] and one of them die and have no child
[50:01] the wife of the Dead shall not marry
[50:03] without unto a
[50:06] stranger her husband's brother shall go
[50:09] in unto her and take her to him to wife
[50:12] and perform the duty of a husband's
[50:15] brother unto her and it shall be that
[50:18] the firstborn which she beareth shall
[50:21] succeed in the name of his brother which
[50:24] is dead that his name be not put out of
[50:29] Israel it says if the husband of a woman
[50:33] dies then the nearest Kinsman of her
[50:35] husband is to bring resurrection of the
[50:39] name and the family of his Dead Brother
[50:42] by marriage and by seed amen because
[50:46] marriage and seed is what brings forth a
[50:49] family and a race of people and even a
[50:53] nation so second uh
[50:57] scripture 1 Corinthians chap 15 verse
[51:01] 21-
[51:09] 22 for it says for sins by men Came
[51:13] Death by men came also the resurrection
[51:17] of the
[51:18] Dead for as in Adam all die even so in
[51:23] Christ shall all be made alive amen so
[51:27] let us bow again once again father we
[51:29] ask you Lord to anoint the word that we
[51:33] read we can open the Bible we can read
[51:37] it Lord but it will take your Holy
[51:39] Spirit to give us understanding yes and
[51:42] may you bless bless the word in Jesus
[51:44] Christ's name amen amen so you may be
[51:46] seated this
[51:50] morning so my title is uh Redemption by
[51:54] marriage and the is resurrection by
[51:58] Union and by seed so we know that the
[52:02] seed are a very powerful thing they come
[52:06] in many different form and without seed
[52:10] there is no continuation of life right
[52:14] because seed is a continuation
[52:16] continuous life and resurrect life when
[52:20] a plant dies it as a resurrection by the
[52:24] seed that is in itself
[52:27] amen and because of that it rises again
[52:29] the next
[52:30] spring and all of that are familiar with
[52:33] that amen anything that is not living by
[52:36] the word is not living because life can
[52:38] only exist by the word of God just like
[52:42] Timothy 56 he said but she that liveth
[52:45] in pleasure is dead while she is
[52:51] alive so without the word of God without
[52:54] the seed of God you are not really
[52:57] living the
[52:58] life and the word of God is the seed of
[53:01] God so outside of the word you cannot
[53:03] continue to live in Genesis 1:1 speaks
[53:08] of uh the seed will bring forth of its
[53:12] kind because that is what continues life
[53:15] and brings Resurrection is because of
[53:17] the seed that is within let every seed
[53:21] bring forth of its kind no so John 663
[53:25] said it is the SP spirit that quickeneth
[53:27] the flesh Propet it nothing right the
[53:31] word that I speak unto you they are
[53:33] spirit and there are life so without the
[53:36] word even though you are living you are
[53:38] still dead in the sight of God so the
[53:41] word of God which is the seed of God
[53:44] contains spirit and life of God and if
[53:46] that word is in you you cannot fail but
[53:51] to rise again because the seed of God is
[53:53] in you so there is a word coming out let
[53:57] every seed bring forth of its kind so
[54:01] the seed has a transforming power and if
[54:04] you are the seed of God even though you
[54:07] fail amen you fail you can still rise up
[54:10] because the power within the seed will
[54:12] rise up let every seed bring force of
[54:16] its kind amen so if you are the seed of
[54:19] God you will overcome all the obstacles
[54:21] in life Hallelujah Lord so the seed is
[54:26] the life carrier and without seed there
[54:28] is no life and no Resurrection so
[54:30] brother bham types the denominational as
[54:33] a rotten
[54:34] egg because they don't have any seed in
[54:38] the message the super saan that's the
[54:40] way with our organization
[54:43] religion until they come in contact with
[54:46] the mate Jesus Christ there AB band of
[54:49] rotten eggs the whole thing needs to be
[54:52] thrown out of the nest they'll never
[54:54] hatur and the best thing to do is clean
[54:57] out the nest and start all over again
[55:00] get the mate Christ
[55:03] Jesus so before you can have a
[55:06] resurrection of New Life there must be
[55:09] first a union and a seed
[55:12] combination and Resurrection is not an
[55:15] event Resurrection is a
[55:18] person so you need to know the person be
[55:22] be before you can enter into the event
[55:25] just like John 11:
[55:28] 2124 so you don't need to open your
[55:30] Bible just we we have a overhead just
[55:33] for the sake of time in J uh about
[55:37] Lazarus and they're looking and the
[55:40] family of blz looking for Jesus to come
[55:42] and then Martha said unto Jesus Lord if
[55:45] thou Hast been here my brother had not
[55:48] died so he believed in Jesus Christ
[55:52] because he saw his ministry all the
[55:54] Miracles and all the healing and the
[55:56] campaign he believed in Jesus Christ
[55:59] that's why he said if if if if thou H
[56:02] has been here my brother had not died he
[56:05] believe
[56:07] it but I know he said but I know that
[56:11] even now whatsoever will ask of God God
[56:14] will give it unto thee she believe him
[56:17] amen she has a confidence in him and
[56:21] Jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[56:23] rise
[56:24] again hallelujah amen amen amen it gives
[56:28] a consolation but
[56:31] Martha has a different
[56:33] thinking and he thought that
[56:35] Resurrection was an event and it is a
[56:38] future
[56:40] time Martha said unto him I know that he
[56:43] shall rise again he believed in the
[56:45] resurrection as an event right I know
[56:49] that he shall rise again in the
[56:51] resurrection at the last day
[56:57] and many believe also the message of the
[56:59] hour I know the message of the hour I
[57:02] read the spoken word I heard the message
[57:04] of the hour I saw the picture I saw but
[57:06] they don't really know the message of
[57:08] the hour but they
[57:10] believe just like Martha I believe Jesus
[57:13] Christ if you my brother will not
[57:17] die but I know that even now
[57:21] whatsoever th will ask of God God will
[57:24] give it unto thee he has a confidence in
[57:26] him
[57:27] amen and Jesus said unto my brother
[57:30] shall rise what a consolation he will
[57:32] rise and Mara said unto him I know that
[57:35] he shall rise again in the resurrection
[57:37] at the last days but Jesus said uh Jesus
[57:40] in verse 25 and Jesus said unto her I am
[57:43] the resurrection and the life he that
[57:46] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[57:48] he shall live so Resurrection is a
[57:52] person before it will be an event you
[57:55] need to know Jesus Christ as a person of
[57:57] the Resurrection before the event will
[58:00] take place in your life amen hallelujah
[58:03] it is not the Ben in the future tense
[58:05] but it is right now if you believe in
[58:09] me hallelujah amen he in me though he
[58:14] were dead yet he shall live Hallelujah
[58:18] Christ is the word and he's the only one
[58:20] that carries the Original Seed of the
[58:22] original life and he is the life Bearer
[58:26] amen so if there's any life especially
[58:29] eternal life then there must be of
[58:31] necessity be seed Associated praise God
[58:35] with that
[58:37] life CU see in the Garden of Eden in the
[58:40] in the book of the beginning death came
[58:43] by Adam rais by a false Union and a
[58:46] hybrid
[58:47] seed so therefore Resurrection can only
[58:51] return to Adam's Race by true Union with
[58:55] Christ and by receiving the Original
[58:58] Seed of the original life
[59:02] again
[59:05] Hallelujah Resurrection by Union and by
[59:09] sin that's why in our opening scripture
[59:12] if Brethren dwells together and one of
[59:14] them die and have no child the wife of
[59:18] the Dead shall not marry without a
[59:21] stranger he will not marry somebody else
[59:24] her husband's brother should shall go in
[59:26] unto her and take her to him wife and
[59:29] perform the duty of an husband's brother
[59:32] unto her and it shall be that the
[59:34] firstborn which she buth shall succeed
[59:38] in the name of his brother which is dead
[59:40] that his name be not put out of
[59:44] Israel Hallelujah God is so good he
[59:48] because if the first husband a woman
[59:50] dies then the nearest Kinsman is to
[59:52] bring a resurrection of the name of the
[59:56] family of his Dead Brother by marriage
[59:58] and by seed because marriage and seed is
[1:00:00] what brings forth a race of people this
[1:00:02] is a prophecy in these last days in the
[1:00:06] book of
[1:00:08] Exodus in verse
[1:00:10] 32 chapter
[1:00:13] 32:10 now therefore let me alone that my
[1:00:16] wrath may walk hot against them that I
[1:00:20] may consume them and I will make of thee
[1:00:23] a great nation God is so with the
[1:00:26] brilliant people God is in his Ro was
[1:00:29] going to wipe out the Jewish race and
[1:00:31] resurrect that race again by Moses seed
[1:00:35] a resurrection by seed this is the
[1:00:37] principle of the
[1:00:40] Bible because God has a pattern and
[1:00:42] never changes word it never changes
[1:00:45] pattern we may have different season
[1:00:47] different ages but the pattern is still
[1:00:49] the same that's why we can say the same
[1:00:52] yesterday today and forever if we can
[1:00:55] see praise God the pattern in the Old
[1:00:57] Testament we can see he was going it
[1:00:59] praise God in the in the New Testament
[1:01:02] because he is the Alpha and the Omega
[1:01:05] when he started he's going to achieve
[1:01:07] Amen in the last days so we see the
[1:01:09] pattern is typ throughout the stories of
[1:01:11] the Bible in the book of Bruth and we
[1:01:13] know in the book of Bruth praise God
[1:01:15] there's only four chapter and the Book
[1:01:18] of Bruth when elex no husband died it
[1:01:21] takes boas brings a resurrection and a
[1:01:23] restoration to the family and the the
[1:01:26] lineage of IMC by uniting with Ruth in a
[1:01:29] marriage and Union by giving her
[1:01:34] seed in 1 Samuel chapter 25 we see that
[1:01:39] nabal Abigail's first husband died then
[1:01:42] she was United in marriage with David
[1:01:46] during the time of his exil before he
[1:01:48] was made King over
[1:01:50] Israel Abigail had two son the first one
[1:01:52] was called Kad which means like his
[1:01:56] father and Tamar
[1:01:59] also praise God received
[1:02:03] seed after her husband
[1:02:05] died and Rahab the Gentile Harlot
[1:02:08] received seed by
[1:02:10] Salon praise God after she heard the
[1:02:13] message of the hour in times of judgment
[1:02:16] and brought forth the lineage of King
[1:02:19] David and the son of David all these
[1:02:22] stories in the Bible are revealing
[1:02:24] something to us
[1:02:26] about this Great Harvest Time and
[1:02:29] Resurrection time that we are now living
[1:02:31] in because the marriage of the Lamb is
[1:02:35] come am amen hallelujah this is the
[1:02:39] season that we are living in now Christ
[1:02:42] has also opened to us the entire mystery
[1:02:45] of the seed of the entire Bible in order
[1:02:47] to release the full potency of his
[1:02:50] Original Seed at this time to cause a
[1:02:53] resurrection to take place in this hour
[1:02:56] amen how will it take place by Union and
[1:02:59] by seed and this is the life of
[1:03:03] immortality so we know that it is Christ
[1:03:07] the second Adam that brings about the
[1:03:10] resurrection in this hour of the Bride
[1:03:13] of the seventh Church ages because of a
[1:03:16] people in this day that come into a
[1:03:18] union with him and that have received
[1:03:20] the fullness of his seed of his original
[1:03:22] word again amen so the word is being
[1:03:26] restored so how does the restoring take
[1:03:28] place this hour by marriage and by Union
[1:03:31] by The Original Seed of the word of God
[1:03:33] being restored to us again in its
[1:03:37] fullness we don't have any part word in
[1:03:40] these last days the full word was being
[1:03:43] restored in these last days amen we
[1:03:46] don't have the message just
[1:03:49] sanctification or justification we have
[1:03:51] the fullness of the word in this last
[1:03:54] days the fullness of Christ
[1:03:57] the seed word of God it is the life and
[1:04:00] the voice of the seed of the revealed
[1:04:02] word that is calling our name in this
[1:04:03] hour that is what will produce the
[1:04:05] resurrection in this hour the word of
[1:04:07] God that is being given unto us in the
[1:04:10] book of Bruth we see this portrayed in
[1:04:12] the prophecy for this time that we are
[1:04:14] now living
[1:04:15] in because imc's household all died the
[1:04:19] Original Seed was
[1:04:22] lost IMC died his son died praise God
[1:04:27] God but because El Li's household all
[1:04:30] died and the Original Seed was lost and
[1:04:32] that was Adam's Fallen race but boas by
[1:04:35] marriage Union and by seed raised up the
[1:04:37] house of IMC again which is the type of
[1:04:41] Christ so in the book of Bru chapter
[1:04:44] 4 verse
[1:04:48] 2-5 and he took 10 men of the Elders of
[1:04:52] the city and said sit ye down here and
[1:04:55] they sat
[1:04:58] down he's going to pronounce amen just
[1:05:01] like Revelation 5 all the 24 ERS are
[1:05:03] sitting behind the
[1:05:08] throne and and Christ praying the price
[1:05:12] of redemption takes the book with a name
[1:05:15] in it and give it to the seventh angel
[1:05:17] in Revelation 10 to speak it out to the
[1:05:20] church so he gathered all the elders as
[1:05:23] a witness what is going and he said unto
[1:05:26] the kingsman neomi that is come again
[1:05:29] out of the country of Moab and sell it
[1:05:31] parel of land which was our brother
[1:05:35] imix and I thought to advertise this
[1:05:38] saying buy it before the inhabitants and
[1:05:40] before the Elders of the people if thou
[1:05:43] wil redeem it redeem it
[1:05:47] right but if thou will not redeem it
[1:05:50] then tell me that I may know for there
[1:05:52] is none to redeem it beside thee and I
[1:05:55] am up after thee and he said I will
[1:05:57] redeem
[1:06:00] it it's this like of Satan he always
[1:06:03] trying to to be our
[1:06:08] Kinsman but when given a chance to
[1:06:11] redeem us he will
[1:06:12] not he will just come and destroy amen
[1:06:16] but he will not take side with
[1:06:18] you
[1:06:20] amen it was going to cause him to redeem
[1:06:23] back with eliminate loss that would that
[1:06:25] was going to spoil his own wealth
[1:06:27] because the son of Bruth would go on to
[1:06:29] inhibit it for a limic family's name yes
[1:06:33] amen then verse five then boas what day
[1:06:36] thou buyest the field of the of the hand
[1:06:39] of noi thou must buy it also of Bruth
[1:06:43] the
[1:06:43] moabites the wife of the Dead to raise
[1:06:46] up the name of the Dead upon his
[1:06:48] inheritance so boas was a type of Christ
[1:06:51] who was prepared to have his own
[1:06:53] inheritance marred in order to bring
[1:06:56] Resurrection to Adam's Fallen
[1:06:59] race and the kingsman said I cannot
[1:07:02] redeem it for myself lest I Mar my own
[1:07:05] inheritance redeem thou my right to
[1:07:09] thyself for I cannot redeem it so to be
[1:07:12] the part of Resurrection in the first
[1:07:14] day that we are living in you must first
[1:07:17] come into Union with Christ and receive
[1:07:20] the seed of the revelation of the
[1:07:22] original word of God again
[1:07:26] am you cannot be in the resurrection
[1:07:29] without receiving the word of God again
[1:07:32] in this last days especially the
[1:07:33] revealed word of God because God uh God
[1:07:37] came down praise God and used Malachi 4
[1:07:39] and Revelation 10:7 and reveal this
[1:07:43] divinely mystery truth that will turn
[1:07:45] literally turn our heart back to the
[1:07:47] father thank
[1:07:49] you so to be the part of the first rest
[1:07:51] in this day that we are living in you
[1:07:53] must first come into Union with Christ
[1:07:55] the revealed word and received the seed
[1:07:57] of the revelation of the original word
[1:07:59] of God again for seven Church ages the
[1:08:02] seed of God came in portion for its age
[1:08:05] through the messenger for each age of
[1:08:07] the seven Church ages and by that
[1:08:09] portion of the word it gave them life to
[1:08:11] fulfill the work of God for their day
[1:08:14] amen God only gave a portion of word in
[1:08:17] each Church age and they are God's
[1:08:21] coworker they are not working
[1:08:26] with God they are a coworker because it
[1:08:30] was
[1:08:31] God through them
[1:08:34] work his will unto them amen we are not
[1:08:40] working but we are a coworker because
[1:08:43] was Christ in you doing the work amen a
[1:08:47] porable word is enough for them in the
[1:08:50] time of Luther the just live Faith
[1:08:52] that's is enough for them amen in time
[1:08:55] of wday sanctification it's enough for
[1:08:58] them in the day of Pentecost restoration
[1:09:00] of the that's enough for them but in our
[1:09:02] day it was be the fullness of the word
[1:09:04] of God in this last days not only a
[1:09:07] portion not only you are Justified and
[1:09:09] Sanctified baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:11] but it is the Holy Ghost himself in the
[1:09:13] person living through you God is working
[1:09:17] through you so that's why you become a
[1:09:19] coworker you become a priest and King in
[1:09:21] the sight of God and a priest always
[1:09:24] present the people people to God while
[1:09:28] the prophet present God to the people so
[1:09:32] why as a priest praise God we mediate
[1:09:34] Upon Our beloveds amen we mediate upon
[1:09:37] the people we become an intercessor we
[1:09:39] become a a a mediator we are standing in
[1:09:42] the Gap with our people because we are
[1:09:45] presenting the people to God where are
[1:09:47] the prophet are presenting God to the
[1:09:49] people
[1:09:50] Amen in the Old Testament when the when
[1:09:53] the worshipper bring a sacrifice was the
[1:09:55] PRI that will bring the sacrifice into
[1:09:57] the presence of God and if the the
[1:09:59] priest is worthy then he will turn back
[1:10:02] and all those Believers or worshippers
[1:10:05] praise God feel
[1:10:09] relief but when the priest is entering
[1:10:12] they are in constant
[1:10:15] Battle Is My Sacrifice be accepted if my
[1:10:20] sacrifice be worthy they are in great
[1:10:24] fear
[1:10:26] maybe the priest is not
[1:10:28] worthy but when the priest coming out
[1:10:31] and bring the sacrifice they feel
[1:10:33] will but in our day different we have
[1:10:36] now access and boldness to enter into
[1:10:39] the Throne of God Amen because we are
[1:10:42] Redeemed by the blood of God and our
[1:10:44] Redemption is
[1:10:47] irreversible even though how much trial
[1:10:49] and testing it cannot be
[1:10:51] reversed Hallelujah although Satan will
[1:10:54] put something in you praise God this is
[1:10:56] not worthy this is not something this is
[1:10:59] not this is not but the blessing is
[1:11:03] irreversible praise the Lord
[1:11:08] sir praise God Amen we will suffer the
[1:11:13] consequences of what we
[1:11:15] did but the blessing is irreversible
[1:11:19] amen that's why we have a
[1:11:22] genuine repentance and there are fake
[1:11:24] repent repentance genuine
[1:11:28] repentance are willing to accept the
[1:11:32] consequences of his
[1:11:35] mistake just like the prodigal son he
[1:11:37] was a son but he is willing to accept
[1:11:40] the consequences as he's willing to
[1:11:42] become a servant instead of a
[1:11:45] son but a fake repentance is somebody
[1:11:50] who repent apologize but no remorse
[1:11:56] right right always blaming others for
[1:12:00] the mistake that he had
[1:12:02] done and even asking people to take side
[1:12:05] with their
[1:12:07] mistakes they repent but that is fake
[1:12:11] repentance but a genuine repentance is
[1:12:13] willing to accept whatever
[1:12:16] consequences that comes their way Amen
[1:12:19] brother and when they repent genuinely
[1:12:22] God is faithful to forgive their sin
[1:12:24] thank you Lord amen amen amen hallelujah
[1:12:30] so in each say they have a portion of
[1:12:32] the Original Seed but in this last day
[1:12:34] it must be the entire seed that comes
[1:12:37] together in Union with the people a
[1:12:39] church in order to produce the literal
[1:12:42] resurrection of 2,000 years of sleeping
[1:12:45] Saints in this hour they are looking for
[1:12:48] us we have the full word so we don't
[1:12:51] have any
[1:12:53] excuse amen
[1:12:57] in the time of the
[1:13:01] Reformation they believe the message but
[1:13:04] they still have
[1:13:06] sinned so that's why God act as an
[1:13:10] intercessor a mediator for their
[1:13:13] ignorance but in this last day he come
[1:13:17] not as an intercessor but he come as a
[1:13:21] judg amen so there is judgment at the
[1:13:25] same time there is comfort in the
[1:13:28] land
[1:13:30] amen so in Genesis 4:25 Adam knew his
[1:13:35] wife again and he bear a son and called
[1:13:38] his name Seth for God said she had
[1:13:42] appointed me another seed instead of
[1:13:44] Abel whom Cain slew Seth was a type of
[1:13:48] Christ Resurrection in the Ming
[1:13:50] infallible proof of the Resurrection
[1:13:53] then when he slew AB
[1:13:57] he thought he got it because he
[1:13:59] destroyed the only righteous part of the
[1:14:04] seed then God rais up set to take his
[1:14:07] place a beautiful Ty of the death of
[1:14:09] Christ and the resurrection of Christ
[1:14:12] amen hallelujah so even Isaac was also
[1:14:15] one received from the
[1:14:18] dead because he came by the Seed of
[1:14:21] Abraham so notice in the beginning death
[1:14:24] came by a FSE Union of a wrong seed that
[1:14:27] was received in the womb of the
[1:14:32] woman the verse is so therefore life can
[1:14:35] only come back by the right Union and
[1:14:38] the right seed of the original word back
[1:14:41] in the womb of a woman
[1:14:43] again so death came by a hybrid seed of
[1:14:47] the serpent seed but we know all the
[1:14:49] stories about it God praise God allow it
[1:14:52] to happen in order to express his
[1:14:55] attributes amen nothing happens by
[1:14:58] chance everything praise God is for the
[1:15:01] glory of God so that's why everything
[1:15:03] that happens in our lives God has
[1:15:05] already ordered it even he said that
[1:15:09] every footstep of the righteous men are
[1:15:12] ordered arranged by God even your trial
[1:15:16] and your trusting are ordered and
[1:15:18] arranged by God he know your weaknesses
[1:15:21] he knows the what do you want he know
[1:15:23] what what's good for you so that's why
[1:15:25] he put something in you because he
[1:15:28] knows and ordain it for you to mold your
[1:15:34] character into His Image nothing is by
[1:15:37] chance so whatever trial you are in
[1:15:40] right now it seems like it get so dark
[1:15:42] Nothing by chance I have no right to
[1:15:45] overcome no God said he that Hearth my
[1:15:50] word shall overcome amen you can only
[1:15:54] overcome by the word of God nothing else
[1:15:56] not by your strength and your power but
[1:15:58] by your spirit but by the word of God
[1:16:01] because Faith cometh by hearing and that
[1:16:03] hearing by the
[1:16:04] word the word that was revealed in our
[1:16:07] day it was Christ in you the hope of
[1:16:10] glory so that's why don't that's why
[1:16:13] Paul said think it not
[1:16:18] strange that you fall into diverse man
[1:16:21] think it not
[1:16:23] strange sometimes we wonder why why is
[1:16:25] so trial so as if as if trial is so
[1:16:31] strange I am saved that I being punished
[1:16:34] I saved why do this every time I do good
[1:16:37] there
[1:16:40] always everybody can relase about that
[1:16:43] but praise God for the message of the
[1:16:45] hour everything is put in
[1:16:48] order amen hallelujah nothing is by
[1:16:50] chance nothing is by accident everything
[1:16:52] is by by by by by predestination and
[1:16:56] predestination not only your being God
[1:16:58] your trials and your testing also
[1:17:00] predestinated for you and to overcome is
[1:17:03] also predis it's a package
[1:17:07] deal amen because he is the Alpha and
[1:17:10] the Omega and in between that's your
[1:17:12] package amen your trial or sickness your
[1:17:16] sickness your trials praise God
[1:17:19] sometimes some of us will fall into
[1:17:21] depression anxiety nervousness all
[1:17:23] sickness that is your package
[1:17:27] deal that's why he said in Psalm 103
[1:17:30] remember thy
[1:17:32] benefits don't forget your
[1:17:35] benefits because God
[1:17:38] hallelujah is our healer that's right
[1:17:41] and forget don't forget your
[1:17:46] benefits amen am don't lock in your door
[1:17:51] closet and cry and have P party
[1:17:56] the word of God said remember thy
[1:17:58] benefits amen he healed you he lift you
[1:18:02] up Hallelujah he comforter you amen
[1:18:06] you're healer comforter deliverer
[1:18:09] miracle workers everything that you need
[1:18:12] is already in his
[1:18:14] word don't come into your closet and
[1:18:17] have a py party and cry and cry and
[1:18:20] don't don't have time to eat and walk no
[1:18:23] no you need to rise
[1:18:26] up I am a Son of God I am the daughter
[1:18:30] of God I am a Son of God yes I have
[1:18:33] trouble yes I have testing yes but I
[1:18:35] still the Son of God when you are a son
[1:18:38] of God doesn't mean that you don't have
[1:18:40] immune to the to the tri and testing yo
[1:18:42] you are a son of
[1:18:44] God that's why when the when Jesus
[1:18:47] Christ was baptized in the Jordan River
[1:18:49] the first thing that the Satan do is
[1:18:52] temp him
[1:18:55] he will not temp you if you if he he
[1:18:58] know that you are not a son of
[1:19:01] God after his baptism he was tempted
[1:19:04] because Satan knows that he was a Son of
[1:19:06] God he identified him this is my beloved
[1:19:09] Son in whom I well pleased to dwell in
[1:19:13] and Satan temp him because he recognized
[1:19:16] him to be the Son of
[1:19:19] God right so if you are the son of God
[1:19:24] he will temp you because he recognize
[1:19:27] that you are a son of God praise the
[1:19:29] Lord he all is testing and he said and
[1:19:31] he command you if you are the Son of God
[1:19:34] command the
[1:19:36] stone to take
[1:19:39] bread he is not telling him but he's
[1:19:42] commanding
[1:19:43] him because Satan know that he was a
[1:19:49] commander right so he command him to
[1:19:52] turn the stone into bread
[1:19:55] so he's commanding the
[1:19:58] commander because the commander he knows
[1:20:02] that he Jesus Christ is the bread of
[1:20:03] life so that's why he turned his St into
[1:20:06] bread because Jesus Christ was the bread
[1:20:08] of life he command him to turn the toone
[1:20:11] into AB bread because the commander is
[1:20:15] sitting Satan know how to
[1:20:18] address with
[1:20:20] respect thank you
[1:20:22] Lord that's why even though you have in
[1:20:25] trial he still respect
[1:20:27] you that you are Sons or Daughters of
[1:20:29] God Amen he will not tempt you beyond
[1:20:32] your capacity to
[1:20:34] overcome because as the Paul said no one
[1:20:37] no no trial can come our ways that we
[1:20:39] cannot overcome he already overcome it
[1:20:42] so if you overcome it you need to shake
[1:20:45] yourself don't despair Hallelujah
[1:20:48] sometimes we we we we sometimes we
[1:20:51] lost our Focus that we are sons and
[1:20:54] Daughters of
[1:20:56] God remember that we are sons of God
[1:20:59] when the seven seal was open in this
[1:21:02] last day it was not an accident what is
[1:21:05] the purpose of opening of the Seven
[1:21:07] Seals to reveal himself to
[1:21:09] you to tell you that he loves you even
[1:21:13] before the foundation of the word praise
[1:21:16] the Lord and if he loves you not as
[1:21:19] denominational think love was pting in
[1:21:23] your shoulder
[1:21:25] amen say good things but the love of God
[1:21:29] is with
[1:21:31] chastisement he will chastise you every
[1:21:33] Sons and Daughters of God that comes
[1:21:34] with he will be
[1:21:36] chastised amen because God's love us so
[1:21:39] that's why he corrected us
[1:21:51] amen so in the message
[1:21:56] there is only one way provided by God
[1:21:59] for
[1:22:03] anything so this title is always a
[1:22:08] declaration a prophet don't come and
[1:22:10] just preach A good
[1:22:12] sermon a prophet is a mouthpiece of God
[1:22:15] so everything that comes out of his
[1:22:18] mouth
[1:22:19] is a
[1:22:21] declaration there's only one way provid
[1:22:24] Ed by God for
[1:22:26] anything he said God promised this
[1:22:29] church a scriptural
[1:22:33] sign small letter
[1:22:36] C he said Resurrection would be
[1:22:41] reproduced Jesus Christ and his Capital
[1:22:44] C Church would become so they'd be one
[1:22:49] so there is a scriptural sign praise God
[1:22:53] he said rest ction would be reproduced
[1:22:56] and Jesus Christ and his Capital C
[1:23:00] church not the William Bram Tabernacle
[1:23:03] Church not the evening light Tabernacle
[1:23:05] Church but a church mean in Greek word
[1:23:08] eclesia which means the C out one so in
[1:23:12] this last days in this evil age God
[1:23:14] called us out of this Darkness out of
[1:23:17] this evil age not only called us out
[1:23:20] praise God but he has chosen us he
[1:23:23] elected us he selected us praise God he
[1:23:26] separated us he justified us he
[1:23:29] Sanctified us he glorified us it is
[1:23:32] already
[1:23:34] done we just need to recognize that God
[1:23:37] do everything for you and me it is not
[1:23:41] for somebody else when the seven seal
[1:23:43] was open it was not directed for anybody
[1:23:47] else that's right when he
[1:23:51] resurrected the day of his resurrection
[1:23:53] he didn't go to a public speaking
[1:23:56] anymore he didn't go to the big
[1:23:58] gatherings of the Parise and seduces he
[1:24:01] didn't go to a very significant place
[1:24:03] just like
[1:24:05] Nazareth but said I'm going to meet you
[1:24:08] in Galilee there is a specific place
[1:24:11] where God can meet us in this last days
[1:24:14] and that is in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:16] not in any certain places but a special
[1:24:20] place which is the revealed word of the
[1:24:23] hour the chosen place of worship of God
[1:24:26] is in the revealed word of the hour no
[1:24:28] other else that's why when he resurrect
[1:24:31] praise God he
[1:24:33] specifically went to his
[1:24:38] disciple not anybody
[1:24:42] else and the first one who know that he
[1:24:45] was
[1:24:47] resurrected was Mary a
[1:24:50] woman which is a type of the church
[1:24:53] right
[1:24:55] and he went and tell his disciple he is
[1:24:58] risen he is
[1:25:02] risen but they did but they they they
[1:25:06] did they believe her
[1:25:10] no they recognized that there was an
[1:25:13] empty tomb but they
[1:25:15] didn't believe her that's right then all
[1:25:18] the disciple went to the tomb and Ste
[1:25:20] the he was not
[1:25:22] here but they still don't believe her
[1:25:26] right so that's why the message of the
[1:25:28] hour Hallelujah it takes Jesus Christ
[1:25:32] the Holy Spirit personally to reveal to
[1:25:34] you this message because New Birth is a
[1:25:37] personal revelation of Jesus Christ you
[1:25:40] cannot get the Revelation by by our
[1:25:43] pastor by whosoever Ministry whosoever
[1:25:46] but it take the spirit of God praise God
[1:25:48] who will reveal himself to you that's
[1:25:51] why when he resurrected he opened the
[1:25:54] understanding about the scripture he
[1:25:56] point them he is R he he he he is not
[1:25:59] here because he is risen according to
[1:26:01] what he
[1:26:02] said so he's pointing them to the
[1:26:05] scripture that's right
[1:26:09] am then he confirmed the scripture to
[1:26:11] them because when he walked with the man
[1:26:14] in the Mayo what are you so sad about
[1:26:17] did you know you are Stranger in this
[1:26:18] country you don't know what happened and
[1:26:20] we know all we all know about the
[1:26:22] scripture and he said and he open the
[1:26:24] word of God beginning Moses unto his
[1:26:28] time he opening the scripture when the
[1:26:31] seven seal was open his opening
[1:26:33] scripture to us amen and the
[1:26:36] understanding it take the Holy Spirit to
[1:26:37] give us the understanding of the
[1:26:39] scripture that's why Martha said I
[1:26:41] believe you
[1:26:42] Lord I believe in the resurrection but
[1:26:45] he don't know about the person of the
[1:26:47] Resurrection so it take Jesus Christ
[1:26:49] himself to declare I am the resurrection
[1:26:52] and the life and whosoever beli me
[1:26:55] although he dead but he will be alive
[1:26:57] the same like wasse in our day it takes
[1:26:59] the holy spirit of God to reveal to you
[1:27:01] the mystery that's right no amount of
[1:27:04] Education no amount of studying praise
[1:27:06] God no amount of anything can understand
[1:27:09] the word of God except the spirit of God
[1:27:12] remember the word of God was written as
[1:27:14] they were inspired by the holy spirit so
[1:27:17] if it is inspired by the Holy Spirit no
[1:27:19] one can understand it except you have
[1:27:22] the spirit of Christ in you
[1:27:24] so when the spirit of the inspir of
[1:27:26] scripture is in you you will understand
[1:27:29] what he is writing about likewise the S
[1:27:32] seal is thank you Lord hallelujah the
[1:27:35] the S seal was open in our day and in
[1:27:38] our age God promised this church a
[1:27:41] scriptural sign he said Resurrection
[1:27:43] would reproduce Jesus Christ and his
[1:27:45] church amen yes
[1:27:49] sir put an emphasis in it capital c his
[1:27:53] church
[1:27:55] not only a small Church denominational
[1:27:57] churches but a Capital C A church this
[1:28:00] is his personal
[1:28:02] choice the C out one Hallelujah is
[1:28:06] Beloved the elected one
[1:28:09] Hallelujah would become so they would be
[1:28:12] one in the last days you and the word
[1:28:14] will become one as you receive the word
[1:28:17] you become one with a
[1:28:19] word that's why when the seventh seal
[1:28:21] was open praise God to
[1:28:24] take the book John and eat
[1:28:27] it there is an action take the book John
[1:28:30] and eat it and thou must prophesy again
[1:28:34] right he was not telling John to
[1:28:38] preach but he was telling John to
[1:28:42] prophesy that's right so that's why in
[1:28:44] these last days we have a prophetic
[1:28:46] Ministry remember L this year chapter
[1:28:48] chapter 3 that the door was already
[1:28:50] closed and they need to overcome in
[1:28:52] order for an open door in chapter
[1:28:56] four you can only overcome in this last
[1:28:58] day through the hearing of the word that
[1:29:00] was sent in your day no other age you
[1:29:02] cannot overcome any other age except the
[1:29:04] word that was sent in your day so you
[1:29:07] need to overcome into in order to be
[1:29:09] live up to an Open Door in Revelation
[1:29:12] chapter
[1:29:14] 4 and God showed John the things that
[1:29:17] was which is and is to come that is a
[1:29:21] prophetic Ministry that's why in this
[1:29:23] last day there is a slow accelerations
[1:29:25] of the growth because we are now in the
[1:29:27] Harvest time we need to lay in the
[1:29:30] presence of the Lord in this last day
[1:29:32] evangelism is already
[1:29:34] done
[1:29:36] amen it is already done by Ora Robert
[1:29:39] bile Graham when they preach thousand
[1:29:41] and thousand receive Christ but we are
[1:29:43] now in the Harvest Time there is a a
[1:29:46] slot accelerations of we are not to
[1:29:49] evangelize
[1:29:55] I have tried to evangelize but we can
[1:29:58] see the effect is not is different from
[1:30:00] the Ty amen God is only
[1:30:04] gleaning one there one there two there
[1:30:07] four there is no no more multiple God is
[1:30:12] a we need to growth and we need to
[1:30:15] prophesy again and the prophetic
[1:30:18] Ministry is only for the Bride of Jesus
[1:30:20] Christ the things that he has
[1:30:22] done the things that he is doing and the
[1:30:26] things that he's going to do that's why
[1:30:28] we know everything that happens in this
[1:30:30] world the things in the past the present
[1:30:33] tense that he's doing right now and the
[1:30:35] thing that he is continue to do that is
[1:30:37] the prophetic Ministry we need to
[1:30:39] establish ourselves in the word of God
[1:30:41] Amen no more Sensations no more
[1:30:44] Hallelujah no more singing or jumping or
[1:30:47] emotional no we need to be established
[1:30:50] in the word of God know our position if
[1:30:52] you know our position then praise God
[1:30:55] you can do a greater
[1:30:57] works because you know who you
[1:31:01] are the days of emotional something it
[1:31:05] is good you can still feel it you can
[1:31:08] still enjoy crying but that is not the
[1:31:11] main focus of the word of God the main
[1:31:13] focus is to recognize your day and your
[1:31:16] message that's why there is a message
[1:31:18] the prophet said he decare it you need
[1:31:20] to recognize your day and your message
[1:31:23] that is a declaration that is a command
[1:31:26] you need to recognize Hallelujah who are
[1:31:28] they you are not just a church member
[1:31:31] another organization you need to
[1:31:33] recognize that you are a Sons and
[1:31:34] Daughters of God that is the very Pur
[1:31:37] purpose that God opened the seal to let
[1:31:40] us know that our name is in the Lamb's
[1:31:42] Book of Life Hallelujah and that seal
[1:31:44] Hallelujah is calling our name by
[1:31:47] showing us the mystery of who we are in
[1:31:49] this last days we are part of God
[1:31:54] right when we say we are a part of God
[1:31:56] don't look at your flesh that's right
[1:31:59] because your flesh will always
[1:32:00] discourage you he will always tell you
[1:32:03] are not worthy how can you become a Son
[1:32:05] of God you are not worthy you cannot
[1:32:07] mistake you think something different
[1:32:09] how can you claim that you are sons of
[1:32:11] God but nevertheless we need to
[1:32:14] recognize that we are sons of God that's
[1:32:17] right flesh H has nothing to do with who
[1:32:19] we are flesh will become flesh he will
[1:32:22] be rotten one of these days that why
[1:32:24] there will there will be a changing of
[1:32:26] our bodies one of these days because the
[1:32:28] SE must be quickened there is a
[1:32:30] transforming power that he will control
[1:32:32] our spirit and he will control our
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:40] flesh how can you control your spirit
[1:32:42] and control your your flesh if you're
[1:32:45] not eating in the word of
[1:32:48] God you can never overcome by your
[1:32:51] strength by your knowledge you need to
[1:32:53] overcome by recognizing whose seed you
[1:32:55] are in these last
[1:32:59] days
[1:33:01] hallelujah because when the seven seal
[1:33:03] was open the seven Thunder uttered the
[1:33:05] voices John who was in the a of badmos I
[1:33:09] don't know where he get his pen but when
[1:33:12] the seven tenders after the voices he
[1:33:14] was about to
[1:33:19] write we don't know where he get his
[1:33:21] pen but I believe in was thrown into the
[1:33:24] AL Patmos he requested give me a
[1:33:27] pen that I will write my diary my
[1:33:31] experience in pmos amen so everything
[1:33:34] happens in our life Hallelujah is not by
[1:33:36] accident maybe he is not conscious about
[1:33:39] the
[1:33:41] pen but God has something for
[1:33:45] him when it was open I was about to
[1:33:49] write he was so enjoy it he has a pen in
[1:33:52] his hand Hallelujah ready to write but
[1:33:54] the word of God said don't write it
[1:33:56] joh seal the
[1:33:58] word because it will be given to the
[1:34:01] seven Church ages messenger in last days
[1:34:05] but when the messenger of Our Last Days
[1:34:07] come in the same holy spirit that tell
[1:34:09] John don't write it in the same holy
[1:34:12] spirit that tell brother take your pen
[1:34:14] and write
[1:34:15] it Hallelujah and he said one night I
[1:34:18] was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit
[1:34:20] told me to pick up my pen and write one
[1:34:23] J was forbid to write here is the
[1:34:25] prophet last day take up the pen and
[1:34:27] write this is the message of the hour
[1:34:30] take the pen and
[1:34:32] write Hallelujah so I grabbed the pen to
[1:34:35] write the spirit gave me a message for
[1:34:38] the
[1:34:39] church Hallelujah this is the message
[1:34:42] for the church and I want to bring it to
[1:34:44] you it has to do with the word and the
[1:34:47] bride amen the mystery of God is being
[1:34:50] revealed in this last days amen here's
[1:34:53] what I'm trying to say to you the law of
[1:34:55] reproduction is that his species bring
[1:34:57] forth of his
[1:35:00] kind remember in the Book of Genesis
[1:35:03] when God created the Heaven and the
[1:35:04] earth and the second verse and it was
[1:35:07] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:35:10] the earth and the verse three and the
[1:35:12] spirit of God move upon the face of the
[1:35:14] water and he said let there be light let
[1:35:18] there be a permanent Let There Be A Way
[1:35:22] let there be a fall let there be a bird
[1:35:24] but when it comes to the seed he said
[1:35:26] let every seed bring forth to its kind
[1:35:29] he doesn't say let there be a seed
[1:35:31] because the seed was already in the
[1:35:32] ground the seed was already in you
[1:35:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:37] that's why when the message of God it
[1:35:38] just Quicken the SE which is in you
[1:35:42] Hallelujah he didn't say Let There Be se
[1:35:44] he said he let there be SE no let every
[1:35:48] sin bring for to be Sky there is already
[1:35:51] a transforming power in the Sin which is
[1:35:53] in you and Christ the in the message God
[1:35:57] who is rich in Mercy when he when you
[1:35:59] are still a little
[1:36:01] baby confused in darkness that seed was
[1:36:04] already in you hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:08] while you're grouping in darkness the
[1:36:10] seed was already in you laying in there
[1:36:12] for how many years maybe you jump from
[1:36:14] one Church to another trying to find
[1:36:16] what is that se but one day Hallelujah
[1:36:19] the the word light of God Quicken that
[1:36:22] se and you recognize that you are not
[1:36:25] what you are you are what God wants you
[1:36:28] to be you are the sons and daughters of
[1:36:31] God as brother I am now become a new
[1:36:35] chch
[1:36:38] andam you are not an ordinary people
[1:36:41] maybe you're wandering from one Church
[1:36:43] to another but the seed of God was
[1:36:45] already in you let every seed bring
[1:36:48] forth of his kind the seed didn't come
[1:36:50] to
[1:36:51] you when you receive the message of the
[1:36:53] the seed was already in you and when the
[1:36:56] SE message of the Hour come it just
[1:36:59] Quicken the seed which is in come and
[1:37:02] say praise the Lord Praise Lord if you
[1:37:04] are not a seed of God you will not
[1:37:06] respond to the message of the hour
[1:37:08] because only the seed will response to
[1:37:10] the message of the
[1:37:14] hour the law of reproduction is that
[1:37:17] each spey bring forth after its kind
[1:37:21] each spey what spey are
[1:37:29] you I'm sure you are not a
[1:37:31] denominational
[1:37:34] species you're not a Baptist species
[1:37:37] you're not a Catholic
[1:37:38] species but every seed of God if you are
[1:37:42] the seed of God you will manifest
[1:37:47] God whether you like it or
[1:37:50] not because the light of the message of
[1:37:52] the hour is already
[1:37:55] shown when the word of God said let
[1:37:57] there be
[1:37:58] light it Quicken the seed and brings
[1:38:01] life and joy to the seed but for the
[1:38:04] stone it say oh it hurts it's so hot
[1:38:08] just like in penix oh we have
[1:38:11] 100° but when the seed was hit by the
[1:38:14] Light of the word it just quickened and
[1:38:17] rejoice I know Hallelujah I Am Redeemed
[1:38:20] by the blood of God and know one can
[1:38:23] liberate me from the love of God which
[1:38:25] is in Christ Jesus even continue thank
[1:38:29] you even according to Genesis 1:1 and
[1:38:33] God said let the Earth bring forth of
[1:38:36] its kind and Herb yelding seed and fruit
[1:38:40] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:38:44] is in itself amen if you are the seed of
[1:38:52] God
[1:38:54] amen it is not a big problem for you to
[1:38:58] manifest the
[1:39:00] fruit just believe
[1:39:02] it because the fruit is already in the
[1:39:06] seed even though he is in the SE form
[1:39:10] but the potential of the fruit was
[1:39:12] already in his and God said nobody got
[1:39:14] said that not the Pastor said not the
[1:39:17] prophet said but it was God who said it
[1:39:20] let every seed bring forth of its kind
[1:39:22] amen that's why the Holy Spirit say take
[1:39:24] your pen and write
[1:39:28] it
[1:39:29] amen when you are in uh examination when
[1:39:34] you review your examination better to
[1:39:36] write it so that you can
[1:39:39] remember don't memorize it oh I got it I
[1:39:42] got it I got it I got it but you when
[1:39:44] you come into the the actual event you
[1:39:46] forgot
[1:39:49] everything that's why God is so gracious
[1:39:52] thank you pen and write
[1:39:56] it it is good for us that we can read
[1:40:01] what the Holy Spirit inspired the
[1:40:03] prophet so that we will not forget who
[1:40:06] we are we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:40:09] what a privileged people amen don't look
[1:40:12] at yourself always looking at ourselves
[1:40:14] is the is the thing that Satan enjoy so
[1:40:19] much oh he look at it so he was enjoying
[1:40:26] it so that's why when he he knew that
[1:40:30] Jesus Christ with the Son of God behold
[1:40:32] the voice of God
[1:40:35] said behold the Son of God in whom I am
[1:40:38] well
[1:40:39] pleased immediately there he is going to
[1:40:43] Temp
[1:40:44] him so that's why if you press to be a
[1:40:47] chisan if you profess to be sons and
[1:40:49] make sure you have the revelation of Who
[1:40:51] You Are
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:54] not only
[1:40:55] believing because you believe for how
[1:40:57] many months or some maybe how many years
[1:41:01] but when the times have come the testing
[1:41:03] is so
[1:41:05] heavy they
[1:41:07] just back out from who they claim they
[1:41:10] are right but if you know who you are
[1:41:14] Satan come on Satan came on Satan as the
[1:41:18] prophets you if you know who you are you
[1:41:20] can defeat Satan anytime anywhere any
[1:41:23] place
[1:41:24] because the Son of God the word of God
[1:41:26] is already in you
[1:41:29] Lord but expect trials and testing that
[1:41:33] is good for
[1:41:37] us thank you at the moment sometimes
[1:41:40] it's so
[1:41:41] hard but when you continue to move on
[1:41:45] you realize that you are an overcome
[1:41:47] amen you will enjoy it
[1:41:51] amen GL to God
[1:41:54] God said let the Earth bring forth grass
[1:41:57] and the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[1:41:59] yelding fruit after his guy whose seed
[1:42:02] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[1:42:04] so and whatever life was in the seed
[1:42:07] came forth into a plant and then into
[1:42:09] Fruit the very same law applies to the
[1:42:11] church today whatever seed started the
[1:42:15] church will come forth and be like the
[1:42:17] Original Seed because it is the same
[1:42:20] seed in the last days the true right
[1:42:24] church with the parenthesis Christ seed
[1:42:28] will come to The Headstone and she will
[1:42:30] be the Super church superv as he nears
[1:42:33] him they in the bride the bride will be
[1:42:36] so much like him that they will be even
[1:42:40] in his very
[1:42:44] image that was the Holy Spirit that
[1:42:48] inspired brother Bram to write
[1:42:50] it it is written directly for you and I
[1:42:55] am praise the Lord she will come to The
[1:42:59] Headstone whether you like it or not it
[1:43:01] is already being spoken it is already
[1:43:04] being dust say the Lord whether you like
[1:43:06] it you will come into the headstone
[1:43:08] which is
[1:43:09] Christ whether you like it or
[1:43:14] not in order to enjoy me better to come
[1:43:18] into and subject yourself and humble
[1:43:21] yourselves in the presence of God lord I
[1:43:23] can do nothing Within Myself my ambition
[1:43:26] is nothing my my my career is nothing
[1:43:29] let me be Lord identified as your sons
[1:43:31] and daughters of God Amen because he
[1:43:34] promised seek you first the kingdom of
[1:43:36] God and all these things that you need
[1:43:38] your carrier your work and everything
[1:43:40] will be added unto you but seek ye first
[1:43:43] the kingdom which is the word of God the
[1:43:45] revealed word of the
[1:43:48] hour and he said God will supply all
[1:43:52] your needs according to the witches of
[1:43:55] his glory praise Lord and he is willing
[1:43:58] to prosper you praise God Amen not only
[1:44:02] in the flesh but in your
[1:44:04] spirit so don't worry too much about
[1:44:07] these early things as Brother Martin
[1:44:10] said that communism CP into to the
[1:44:13] church we want to become like what
[1:44:16] somebody
[1:44:18] else look at if the Jonas act like this
[1:44:22] I want to be like the Jonas if they have
[1:44:24] the car like this I want to be have a
[1:44:26] car like this if they have a house like
[1:44:28] this I want to become like this
[1:44:31] no just like Abraham I'm looking for a
[1:44:35] city whose Builders and maker is God
[1:44:38] that is the thing that we are need to
[1:44:39] concern about not what somebody else
[1:44:42] said somebody else said will
[1:44:45] always
[1:44:48] fail don't mold yourself by what
[1:44:51] somebody else said that's mold your
[1:44:54] character according to what the word of
[1:44:57] God
[1:44:57] said Hallelujah not what somebody else
[1:45:01] right they may talk about you something
[1:45:03] El no if they are Sons and Daughters of
[1:45:05] God they will not talk something bad
[1:45:08] about you they will encourage you so you
[1:45:11] will know your true friend if
[1:45:13] circumstances comes your way you will
[1:45:16] know your true
[1:45:18] friend your true friend will encourage
[1:45:20] you you will lift you up in time of your
[1:45:23] needs and Times of your trouble they
[1:45:25] will come and comfort you
[1:45:28] amen it's
[1:45:29] true not like the friend of job he
[1:45:33] thought that his friend was his best
[1:45:35] friend but when trials and Come Those he
[1:45:39] consider his best friend are the one who
[1:45:41] accus him of being a secret sinner
[1:45:45] that's not true friend Hallelujah who is
[1:45:48] your true friend no other than the Lord
[1:45:50] Jesus Christ because he promised I will
[1:45:52] never leave you nor forsake you your
[1:45:54] friend this world will forsake and in
[1:45:57] times of trouble they will forsake you
[1:45:59] that's right when you have a lot of
[1:46:01] money you have a lot of friend but if
[1:46:02] you don't have money you don't have
[1:46:04] friend this is what the word
[1:46:08] is but when you serve God whether you
[1:46:11] have money or not God will provide
[1:46:12] everything for
[1:46:14] you God knows what he's done
[1:46:17] amen that's that when you have too much
[1:46:20] money he will correct you that's enough
[1:46:24] you will become so
[1:46:26] worldly so a thought come to my mind
[1:46:28] that they said if you ask anything in my
[1:46:30] name I will do
[1:46:32] it just don't ask to win a
[1:46:39] lotto when you ask
[1:46:42] anything sometimes when we ask
[1:46:45] anything sometimes we become discouraged
[1:46:47] because what we ask didn't God didn't
[1:46:51] answer he said I will do it he didn't
[1:46:55] say
[1:46:58] immediately but he will do
[1:47:02] it we need to recognize whatever God
[1:47:05] said and we asked in his name he will do
[1:47:08] it but he never said I will do it
[1:47:12] immediately or in three in the next day
[1:47:15] I will do it whether it takes how many
[1:47:17] days how many month how many years when
[1:47:19] he promised Abraham I will make you a
[1:47:22] part of many nations Abraham waited 25
[1:47:27] years but Abraham didn't stagger the
[1:47:30] promise of God through unbelief he
[1:47:32] waited for 25 years knowing if God said
[1:47:35] it God is faithful to do it hallelujah
[1:47:40] amen because God answer sometimes yes
[1:47:43] sometimes
[1:47:44] no and sometimes
[1:47:48] wait but he
[1:47:50] answered amen amen Noah waited
[1:47:56] 420
[1:47:58] years but he enjoyed it because he heard
[1:48:02] the voice build the
[1:48:05] ark he just build it and build it and
[1:48:08] build it
[1:48:09] until the ark was became
[1:48:13] manifested he did dis he was not
[1:48:15] discouraged until he see that the
[1:48:18] prophecy was being fulfilled in his day
[1:48:21] being made manifest that said we we will
[1:48:23] not we will will not stop until the word
[1:48:26] of God that what is said that the
[1:48:28] manifestation of Sons and Daughters of
[1:48:30] God will take effect in our day amen
[1:48:34] right you see all over the
[1:48:37] news the climate change the
[1:48:41] tornado the wars volcano eruption
[1:48:45] tsunami amen even in Mexico they are
[1:48:48] they are having a hail storm
[1:48:53] praise God you can look around that it's
[1:48:56] so different right
[1:48:57] now as Paul said they are
[1:49:01] groaning waiting for the manifestations
[1:49:04] of the Sons and Daughters of God the
[1:49:06] Earth is groaning waiting for the
[1:49:10] manifestation manifestations of your you
[1:49:12] and Sons and Daughters of God waiting
[1:49:14] for you they are waiting for
[1:49:18] you to change this
[1:49:23] into a millennial
[1:49:25] Reign where there's no trouble where
[1:49:27] there's no tears no fears no sickness
[1:49:31] whatsoever there is always peace for
[1:49:33] 1,000 years to be with
[1:49:36] Christ
[1:49:39] amen so whatever things that goes our
[1:49:42] way always believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:45] we need to be
[1:49:46] grateful all the
[1:49:48] trials okay it's good for me always
[1:49:53] welcome those trials don't think it a as
[1:49:56] a
[1:49:58] punishment don't think it as a
[1:50:00] punishment that do but think it as a
[1:50:03] teacher amen he will teach you character
[1:50:07] the trial is a character building amen
[1:50:11] because power outside of character will
[1:50:13] be satanic that's right but we need to
[1:50:16] have a character of Christ I don't have
[1:50:19] the character of Christ I am a short
[1:50:21] temper that's why I pastored a church
[1:50:24] for 5 years but I I I realize I I I
[1:50:27] cannot stand as a pastor cuz I have a
[1:50:30] short
[1:50:31] temper I have no patience I want to go
[1:50:35] always jump from one place to
[1:50:37] another amen so praise the Lord you just
[1:50:41] need to be what you are what God gives
[1:50:44] you to be don't impersonate others just
[1:50:47] be what you are if somebody else tells
[1:50:48] about you then they are not the Bride of
[1:50:50] Jesus Christ I tell you because if they
[1:50:53] are the Bride of Jesus Christ they will
[1:50:55] encourage you they will support you but
[1:50:57] if they are not the bride of Christ they
[1:50:59] will criticize you they will gossip
[1:51:01] about
[1:51:03] you they will tell somebody about your
[1:51:08] weaknesses but if you are the Bride of
[1:51:11] Jesus Christ you will cover all kind of
[1:51:13] sin I know that brother make mistakes
[1:51:16] but don't tell it about don't tell it to
[1:51:18] somebody else
[1:51:20] amen right right if you know somebody
[1:51:23] that made a mistakes about you or say
[1:51:26] something about you and you get hurt you
[1:51:27] just go to that brother what brother
[1:51:29] what you tell me about what's wrong with
[1:51:32] me
[1:51:34] what did I make you stumble did I make
[1:51:36] you something like that just tell me
[1:51:39] that I can apologize I can make myself
[1:51:42] clear to you we need to be honest with
[1:51:45] one
[1:51:46] another
[1:51:50] Hallelujah you say praise the Lord
[1:51:56] the very same law applies to the church
[1:51:58] today whatever seed started the church
[1:52:00] will come forth and be like the Original
[1:52:02] Seed because it is the same seed in the
[1:52:05] last days the true bride will come to
[1:52:07] The
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:09] Headstone that ass your word of God they
[1:52:12] will come to The
[1:52:14] Headstone and she will be the Super
[1:52:16] Church a super race as he nears him they
[1:52:19] in the bride will be so much like him
[1:52:22] that they they will be even in his very
[1:52:25] image this is in order to be United with
[1:52:29] him they will be one they will be the
[1:52:33] very manifestations of the word of the
[1:52:36] Living God they will be one how can we
[1:52:39] be one with God is to accept his word in
[1:52:41] this last day whether you like it if you
[1:52:44] are the seed of God you will accept it
[1:52:52] not only believing it but we need to
[1:52:54] know him by the power of his
[1:52:57] resurrection
[1:53:00] amen I will go back to there is only one
[1:53:03] way provided by God for
[1:53:06] anything now he also promised that there
[1:53:08] would be a restoring of the
[1:53:11] faith we read in Jude that he said
[1:53:14] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:53:17] once delivered to the Saints now we are
[1:53:20] promised in Malachi 4 by the the same
[1:53:23] system he always did that we would be
[1:53:25] restored back to the original faith we
[1:53:28] will be
[1:53:29] restored so we need to know who we are
[1:53:33] before we are
[1:53:34] going to be
[1:53:36] restored because if you don't know who
[1:53:39] you are how can you be restored amen not
[1:53:43] only restored in the Pentecostal Faith
[1:53:46] but when the seven seal was open it was
[1:53:49] God who manifest himself in Christ now
[1:53:53] it was Christ himself manifested in his
[1:53:55] church then back to Eden again the
[1:53:58] original faith in the book in The Book
[1:54:00] of Eden we will be returning back to
[1:54:03] that in the first Adam position we have
[1:54:07] fellowship with God we have dominion
[1:54:11] with God praise God we have life eternal
[1:54:14] God is going to restore us back to that
[1:54:16] condition and you need to know who you
[1:54:19] are so that you can enjoy being restored
[1:54:22] again you can have fellowship with God
[1:54:25] just like I said when God Fellowship
[1:54:26] during the time he can do anything he
[1:54:29] want amen he can say God will have
[1:54:32] fellowship and he will just say Amen to
[1:54:33] the every word he enjoy it amen no
[1:54:37] restriction and sometimes you cannot
[1:54:39] understand but just say Amen Lord amen
[1:54:42] Lord he didn't misconstrue Mis interpret
[1:54:45] or mislocate the word of God you just
[1:54:47] amen and amen
[1:54:49] Lord we are being restored back to that
[1:54:52] again if we don't know who we are then
[1:54:56] how can we be restored back right we
[1:54:59] don't know how to act when we be
[1:55:01] restored so restoration is only applied
[1:55:03] to those who are lost and be restored
[1:55:06] back again the revelation of who you
[1:55:11] are amen so when Adam said I want to go
[1:55:15] in the west side of Eden immediately he
[1:55:19] was there amen it was not an
[1:55:23] imagination it is a
[1:55:25] reality because Paul quoted in his
[1:55:28] Revelation he said in the twinkling of
[1:55:31] an eye the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:55:34] first and we which are alive and remain
[1:55:36] shall be caught up together to meet him
[1:55:39] in the air there will be a teleporting
[1:55:42] during the time in the twinkling of an
[1:55:44] eye we will be in his presence praise
[1:55:48] the Lord it is being made available for
[1:55:50] us now amen yes sir so that's why we
[1:55:54] need to practice yes if something comes
[1:55:58] up in your mind and it is the word of
[1:56:00] God don't hit say to say
[1:56:04] it because God is
[1:56:07] trying to train us to speak the word am
[1:56:13] amen don't look at the circumstances
[1:56:16] Lord I cannot make it I no try to speak
[1:56:19] it Lord I am healed Lord I am healed
[1:56:24] Lord
[1:56:25] forgive Lord forgive my brother and God
[1:56:29] will honor your
[1:56:31] word because he said if my word abideth
[1:56:35] in
[1:56:37] you you can speak anything amen and it
[1:56:41] was just like God speaking through you
[1:56:44] that's why you become a coworker of God
[1:56:46] you are not just a worker but you are a
[1:56:49] coworker because it was God in you doing
[1:56:51] the work so that's why speak the word
[1:56:54] when you say God bless you my brother
[1:56:56] God is honoring that word God bless you
[1:56:59] my brother God loves you my brother
[1:57:02] Hallelujah may the blessings of God upon
[1:57:04] you God is going
[1:57:07] to fulfill his
[1:57:12] word we need to practice it amen don't
[1:57:16] look at your troubles your trials every
[1:57:19] trials I have trials more than anybody
[1:57:21] else
[1:57:25] if if you say discouragement I am more
[1:57:27] discouraged than anybody
[1:57:30] else when you look at me we are standing
[1:57:32] or preaching as if no he has no problem
[1:57:35] no I have more problem than most of you
[1:57:40] maybe are we Bound by our problems no no
[1:57:45] we are bound by the love of God which is
[1:57:47] in our heart then Paul said who can
[1:57:49] separate me from the love of God can f
[1:57:51] in can sickness can poor wealth
[1:57:54] everything can you separated from the
[1:57:56] love no no one can separate you from the
[1:57:59] love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[1:58:02] because this is not our choice it is
[1:58:04] God's choice that's right that's why a
[1:58:07] Christian praise
[1:58:09] God it's not our choice but to be a
[1:58:13] Christian is God's choice because no one
[1:58:16] can come to me except the father draw
[1:58:18] him near that's why we are here this
[1:58:20] morning because it was the heaven
[1:58:22] heavely father who
[1:58:24] comes that's why every Fellowship every
[1:58:27] Gathering is a
[1:58:29] supernatural I always believe that
[1:58:31] within my heart it's a supernatural
[1:58:33] thing right maybe some of you it's just
[1:58:36] a common how we come to church we just
[1:58:38] pray we sing song No it is a
[1:58:41] supernatural thing everything you come
[1:58:44] you have
[1:58:45] something that you listen to any
[1:58:48] word it is stored in your hard drive
[1:58:51] amen and when circumstances come he will
[1:58:54] put in amen he will put in remembrance
[1:58:58] the things that you have heard you can
[1:59:01] overcome all the obstacles by the word
[1:59:04] that you heard this last day that's why
[1:59:07] we are so blessed we have Wednesday
[1:59:09] service we have Sunday service we have
[1:59:11] some special
[1:59:15] services so you cannot blame
[1:59:18] God for your failure
[1:59:23] yeah you just blame it for yourself
[1:59:25] that's right you need to study more you
[1:59:27] need
[1:59:28] to that's why Paul said work out on your
[1:59:32] own salvation with fear and trembling
[1:59:34] you need to work out amen so that's why
[1:59:37] our young people if you want to have a
[1:59:38] muscle you need to work
[1:59:41] out amen yes if you have a big tmy like
[1:59:45] me you need to work out to flatten the
[1:59:47] stuff we need to work out so we need to
[1:59:49] work out our faith amen work out our
[1:59:51] faith with fear salvation amen we have
[1:59:54] so many mistakes but brother and sisters
[1:59:56] we are a one group of people if you have
[1:59:59] no mistakes we have somebody that will
[2:00:01] pray for
[2:00:03] you don't run away don't look at
[2:00:06] yourself as if somebody around you
[2:00:10] is somebody some people no the one that
[2:00:14] beside you they are Sons and Daughters
[2:00:16] of God so if you have trouble they are
[2:00:18] willing to pray for
[2:00:20] you amen
[2:00:22] don't look at somebody as if they are
[2:00:24] particular or they are different or they
[2:00:26] are no
[2:00:28] no take away that thought from your mind
[2:00:32] we are one that's why scripture say we
[2:00:35] need to comfort one another with this
[2:00:38] word Mal by the same system he always
[2:00:42] did that we would be restored back to
[2:00:44] the original Faith back to the original
[2:00:47] seed back to the seed like it begin back
[2:00:50] to the same Doctrine word word Power by
[2:00:53] power Spirit by the same thing just like
[2:00:55] it was back in the beginning Hallelujah
[2:00:58] just like in the
[2:01:00] beginning amen we have the Liberty
[2:01:03] whatever God's lead us to do we can just
[2:01:07] speak at the
[2:01:08] word amen musician if you come that's
[2:01:12] why I
[2:01:14] said I will be with you even in you
[2:01:17] until the end of the world and you will
[2:01:19] do greater things because I go to the
[2:01:23] father so he will be using you as his
[2:01:28] mouthpiece
[2:01:30] amen so if they're looking for Christ
[2:01:33] it's in your mouth Christ is the
[2:01:37] word and we
[2:01:39] have a prophetic Ministry to tell them
[2:01:43] what happened in the
[2:01:45] beginning the original sin is not eating
[2:01:48] by Apple it is their original sin you
[2:01:51] can tell them what
[2:01:54] happened what's happening now what God
[2:01:57] is doing our generation and what God is
[2:02:01] doing in the future amen this is no
[2:02:05] longer about
[2:02:06] evangelism that thing is already
[2:02:10] passed so that's why we are commissioned
[2:02:13] to
[2:02:14] prophesy and to prophesy is not about
[2:02:18] evangelism to prophesy means to tell
[2:02:22] what things happen what things happening
[2:02:25] and things that will be am amen
[2:02:29] coming thank you Lord that we recognize
[2:02:32] our day and our
[2:02:33] message amen the seed of God was being
[2:02:36] restored for the purpose of the
[2:02:38] Resurrection thank you Lord thank you
[2:02:41] Lord God look at our mistakes but his
[2:02:45] grace is so sufficient he knows we have
[2:02:47] Commit all mistakes we have shortcomings
[2:02:49] we have mistakes sometimes we thought
[2:02:51] different we think different we feel
[2:02:53] different but by the end of the day we
[2:02:56] just say Lord forgive me for my thought
[2:02:58] for my feelings I don't want to have ill
[2:03:01] feelings with my brothers I don't have
[2:03:03] to think different Lord I want to think
[2:03:05] I don't
[2:03:06] have if there's a malice in Your Heart
[2:03:09] Lord take away all the malice in my
[2:03:10] heart amen take away the grudges take
[2:03:14] away my hate Lord just cleanse me by
[2:03:17] your Holy Spirit consume me Lord by the
[2:03:20] power of your spirit amen
[2:03:22] amen amen don't not be different we are
[2:03:26] called by one Spirit baptized into the
[2:03:29] body of Jesus Christ we are
[2:03:31] [Music]
[2:03:35] one so we need to forgive one another
[2:03:38] encourage one
[2:03:40] [Music]
[2:03:44] another there is a
[2:03:46] resurrection and the resurrection is the
[2:03:48] person of Jesus Christ
[2:03:51] to know
[2:03:52] him is
[2:03:55] life that's why in 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:03:58] 15:1 16 24 if the dead rise not then is
[2:04:02] not Christ
[2:04:04] raised and if Christ be not raised your
[2:04:07] faith is in
[2:04:08] vain ye are not ye are yet in your
[2:04:12] sin then they also which have fallen
[2:04:15] asleep in Christ are
[2:04:18] perish if this life only we have hope in
[2:04:21] Christ
[2:04:23] we are old men most
[2:04:26] [Music]
[2:04:27] miserable but
[2:04:29] now is Christ risen from the dead and
[2:04:33] become the first fruit of them that
[2:04:35] sleep if there is a first there will be
[2:04:38] a second the third fourth and fifth but
[2:04:41] he already prove it that he is risen
[2:04:44] that's right
[2:04:47] Hallelujah for sins by Man Came Death by
[2:04:51] men came also the resurrection of the
[2:04:54] Dead for as in Adam all die even so in
[2:04:58] Christ shall all be made alive but every
[2:05:01] man in his own
[2:05:03] order Christ the first fruit of the word
[2:05:06] they are Christ at his
[2:05:09] coming
[2:05:11] Hallelujah so all the saints from
[2:05:14] Ephesians to our age they are looking
[2:05:19] forward to us and we need to hold on we
[2:05:24] need to believe
[2:05:26] right Satan will bombard us of
[2:05:31] everything in his
[2:05:34] capacity they will give us doubt they
[2:05:36] will give us unbelief in
[2:05:39] everything and they will use our eyes to
[2:05:42] see somebody who is talking who is who
[2:05:44] is who
[2:05:45] is using his
[2:05:47] lips to gossip one another what God is
[2:05:51] using Satan is
[2:05:55] perverting that's why Faith cometh by
[2:05:57] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[2:05:58] and he's using that gossip gossip gossip
[2:06:01] gossip and if you listen to his
[2:06:04] gossip it will affect your
[2:06:06] spirit and you will look at your
[2:06:09] somebody your brother different thing
[2:06:12] because you already
[2:06:14] heard the gossip right that's why when
[2:06:18] Elisha
[2:06:21] curse those
[2:06:24] children who cursing him oh balad
[2:06:27] baldheaded baldheaded baldheaded and he
[2:06:30] cursed them and they all died and the
[2:06:32] prophet said it was not the
[2:06:35] children's mistake but it was the parent
[2:06:39] mistake that's right it was parent
[2:06:45] delinquency so when you talk about some
[2:06:49] Ministry don't talk in front of your
[2:06:52] children that's
[2:06:55] right we you when you don't
[2:06:58] dislike any
[2:07:00] Minister don't Tu it in your dinner
[2:07:04] table that's right because the
[2:07:08] children will
[2:07:11] adopt what they
[2:07:13] heard and in turn they will disrespect
[2:07:17] those
[2:07:19] ministers right spirit ually speaking
[2:07:22] they are already
[2:07:24] dead when you talk about some
[2:07:28] ministers because the parent are talking
[2:07:30] about oh brother so this brother Don't
[2:07:34] Preach well this brother don't don't and
[2:07:37] the children say amen amen because it
[2:07:39] was the father was talking they respect
[2:07:41] the father but in turn that spirit will
[2:07:44] linger into the child and every time he
[2:07:47] saw the ministers even before he
[2:07:49] preached he already conceive
[2:07:53] he has already preconceived that
[2:07:55] Brothers no no no and they don't listen
[2:07:58] to the word anymore then listen to the
[2:08:01] ministry not only to the ministry
[2:08:04] even our friend our neighbors don't talk
[2:08:07] somebody else in your dinner table
[2:08:10] amen because it will affect your
[2:08:13] children amen it will create a spirit of
[2:08:16] disrespect that's why the prophet said
[2:08:19] the prophet uh uh uh preached about
[2:08:23] respect we need to respect not only the
[2:08:26] ministry respect each
[2:08:29] other remember when the brother Braham
[2:08:32] said that he has an he has a neighbor
[2:08:34] who was a
[2:08:36] drunkard and every
[2:08:38] time brother brandham passed by he was
[2:08:41] drunk but every time he brother brandham
[2:08:43] passed by he said good morning
[2:08:46] paron he never said any ill word or bad
[2:08:50] words about
[2:08:52] brother
[2:08:53] [Music]
[2:08:55] benam so every time for how many years
[2:08:58] how many years he just good morning P he
[2:09:00] show respect and finally he
[2:09:03] died and the prophet said and somebody
[2:09:06] asked can he go to heaven and brother

[2:09:46] that's
[2:09:48] right because the word was already
[2:09:50] spoken let every seed bring forth of its
[2:09:54] kind no amount
[2:09:57] Hallelujah of Darkness of trial can stop
[2:10:00] that seed to raise up in it Resurrection
