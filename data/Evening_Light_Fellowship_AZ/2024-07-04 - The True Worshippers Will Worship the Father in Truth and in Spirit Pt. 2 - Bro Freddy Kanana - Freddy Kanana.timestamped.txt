[30:40] two or three are gathering in my name
[30:42] there I am in the very midst of them I'm

[30:46] numbers but we depend on your presence
[30:47] oh Father tonight may you take full
[30:49] charge and full control over the service
[30:52] bless us as we go through the service in
[30:54] Jesus name we pray amen amen thank you
[30:58] musicians for your help in
[31:01] singing shall we remain standing as we
[31:04] go directly to the
[31:10] word shall we go straight to the uh Book
[31:13] of John chapter 4 verse 21-
[31:24] 24 Jesus sayith unto her woman believe
[31:28] be the hour cometh when you shall when
[31:31] ye shall neither in the in this mountain
[31:34] nor yet a Jerusalem worship the
[31:38] father you worship ye know not what we
[31:42] know what we worship for salvation is of
[31:45] the
[31:46] Jews but the hour cometh and now is when
[31:51] the true worshippers shall worship the
[31:53] father in spirit and in truth for the
[31:57] father seeketh such to worship
[31:59] him God is spirit and they that worship
[32:03] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[32:06] truth shall we go to
[32:08] Matthew 4:9 to:
[32:14] 10 in sayith in sayith unto him this is
[32:17] the devil talking to our Lord Jesus
[32:19] Christ in sayith unto him all these
[32:22] things will I give thee if thou will
[32:26] fall down and worship me then saith
[32:30] Jesus unto him get the hands Satan for
[32:34] it is written thou shallal Worship the
[32:37] Lord thy God and him only shall thou
[32:40] serve amen may the Lord add a blessing
[32:43] to the reading of his word as we have
[32:44] your seats
[32:47] tonight thank you bon for trusting in my
[32:51] little
[32:52] Ministry uh to do something tonight but
[32:55] it's not going to be me it's the Lord
[32:56] Jesus Christ amen for we all depend on
[32:59] him even the songs that he been sang
[33:02] here you can feel that the presence of
[33:04] the holy spirit is here the songs we
[33:06] invited him to come and uh we sang how
[33:10] he's holy uh Angel singing Holy uh even
[33:15] uh us as Believers singing Holy but
[33:18] really brother bam
[33:20] says
[33:22] God he doesn't enjoy fully the
[33:25] worshiping of the Angels because angels
[33:27] they don't know what they are singing
[33:29] about but we do know what we're singing
[33:31] about because we've been saved by grace
[33:35] we can tell where we came from uh where
[33:37] we going and where we are at we can
[33:39] truly thank him and we can enjoy singing
[33:42] and praising him amen I know sometimes I
[33:45] don't know if it have happened to you
[33:47] when you see somebody coming to you and
[33:48] thanking you for something that you
[33:50] didn't even help him but he just come
[33:52] maybe he was confused just thanking you
[33:55] so you're not going to take that thank
[33:56] you know really you say no it's not me
[33:58] somebody else did it for you but if you
[34:01] really help the person and the person
[34:03] comes to you say thank you you really
[34:05] take it and you'll be
[34:07] appreciative you see so God takes more
[34:12] uh joy out of the Praises coming from
[34:15] the mouth of his children because they
[34:17] know that he is the savior even in the
[34:21] Old Testament Jesus I mean God was
[34:23] telling the children of Israel reminding
[34:25] them I'm your Lord I'm your God that
[34:28] took you out of the land of uh Egypt to
[34:33] remind them where they were and where
[34:35] they were and when he took them when
[34:37] when where he was with them you see
[34:41] so tonight my uh small uh
[34:46] cermonies the true
[34:48] worshippers will worship the father in
[34:50] spirit and in truth this is part two and
[34:53] for subject we take spiritual revealed
[34:56] truth so
[34:58] if you can tell the ministers can take
[35:00] one uh sermon and stay on the same
[35:02] sermon for a long time because you can
[35:06] approach the same subject from different
[35:08] uh standing Point thousands of thousands
[35:12] of times you can go you know this sermon
[35:14] part two part three four part thousand
[35:17] you can go on and on and on as long as
[35:19] God gives you Revelations to bless his
[35:22] children you can go on and on and on
[35:25] that's why tonight we're here to again
[35:27] with some of the uh the the the things
[35:29] he has opened to us because we've been
[35:31] pondering and meditating on these words
[35:33] so I believe it's going to be truly a
[35:36] blessing tonight
[35:39] amen so we talking about true
[35:44] worshipers in spiritual revealed truth
[35:49] worshiping truly didn't start here on
[35:51] Earth but it started in
[35:55] heaven but abam says God to to be God
[35:58] because he has more attributes in him as
[36:01] this big beings he had more attributes
[36:05] among which was the attribute of God but
[36:07] for that attribute to be fulfilled he
[36:10] had to be
[36:11] worshiped therefore he created angels
[36:14] and Angels start worshiping him and that
[36:17] attribute was
[36:21] fulfilled but Satan butam says he was a
[36:25] certain point as a coal with God
[36:28] he was among angels He is a create I
[36:32] mean a creation and God is a
[36:35] Creator a certain
[36:38] point he thought that he could be
[36:40] worshiped as God that's in
[36:44] heaven and says iniquity
[36:48] means something you know you should do
[36:50] but you don't do it and Lucifer as an
[36:53] angel he's supposed to be worshiping God
[36:57] but he want to be worshiped
[36:59] instead and the Bible says he was good
[37:02] until iniquity was found in him what was
[37:05] iniquity because he knew what he's
[37:06] supposed to be doing but didn't want to
[37:08] do it and was trying to be worshiped
[37:12] Tred to be above Angels Above other
[37:15] Angels that's what caused him to be
[37:17] precipitated from Heaven to he own the
[37:20] Earth not only in the earth they sent
[37:23] him in hell
[37:28] so this is if you look at the this
[37:31] subject you can see many
[37:34] things it's the worshiping that has
[37:36] caused all these
[37:37] troubles not only worshiping but wrong
[37:40] worshiping because God doesn't share his
[37:43] glory of
[37:46] nobody you go in the 10th
[37:48] commandment Moses when he gave the Ten
[37:51] Commandments he started with the your
[37:54] the Lord
[37:55] God is the only God you have to worship
[37:59] one time
[38:01] the Pharisees came over to Jesus they
[38:04] were talking to him asking him questions
[38:07] they came up to him tempting him that
[38:08] was a a lawyer who asked him that
[38:11] question what is the
[38:13] biggest um commandment among the the the
[38:17] law and he says the first one is you
[38:21] have to love your lord God with all your
[38:25] heart all your strength
[38:28] whatever you have in within you to love
[38:31] him and the second you have to love your
[38:33] neighbors and he says do these two first
[38:37] Commandments covering are covering
[38:40] all and then the the
[38:44] prophets and the law are hanging on to
[38:47] these two
[38:53] laws as I said this is a big subject
[38:57] because all troubles that we are going
[38:59] through it's because of the wrong
[39:04] worshiping coming here on the
[39:08] earth when Adam and Eve they got out of
[39:11] the uh they been cast or sent out of the
[39:15] Garden of Eden they had children like
[39:18] brother bam
[39:19] says can and
[39:22] abble and God approached him with the
[39:25] same way of approach to see how they're
[39:28] going to
[39:29] worship one worshiped right and one
[39:32] didn't the other one
[39:35] didn't as would be I'm trying to go
[39:37] ahead of myself but let's just go this
[39:46] way Abel came worship getting Revelation
[39:50] from
[39:52] God andam says in the message
[39:57] glorify
[40:02] Jesus he says now the only way that boy
[40:07] could ever ever did that and know that
[40:11] that was the right sacrifice it has to
[40:13] be a spiritual re Revelation from
[40:17] God that's
[40:19] exactly there has been he he meant to
[40:22] say been has been ever but they says he
[40:24] every it has been ever since spiritual
[40:27] revealed the truth how God in his Mercy
[40:31] through the operations of the Holy
[40:34] Spirit reveals spiritual truth the word
[40:38] itself if you're trying to read it from
[40:41] some educational standpoint you'll just
[40:44] read it like you were you was trying to
[40:48] figure out ma mathematically something
[40:52] but if you read it after you have
[40:55] received Christ
[40:58] into your heart it's a brand new book
[41:01] again it's just a love story God writing
[41:05] it to you it's spiritual
[41:08] revealed God's church is absolutely a
[41:12] spiritual re
[41:14] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[41:18] no man can receive it by his own desire
[41:21] Jesus said no man can come to me ex
[41:25] except my father draws him
[41:28] first is that right yes it has to be a
[41:31] work of the holy spirit in in the
[41:35] beginning to draw the person and when
[41:38] the person comes to God by the Holy
[41:41] Spirit draw Jesus said I will in no wise
[41:46] cast him out give him everlasting life
[41:50] raise him up in the last day what a
[41:53] beautiful hope that gives the the church
[41:57] so last time we saw how um people can
[42:01] just
[42:02] worship and the true worshippers cuz
[42:04] many people here on the Earth are
[42:09] worshiping they are worshiping and Jesus
[42:12] when you see the way he approached this
[42:14] this
[42:15] woman two questions he was telling her
[42:19] woman you worship which that you don't
[42:23] know but we do worship which that we
[42:26] know for salvation is of the
[42:29] Jews if you go deep into this
[42:33] conversation in other words when he says
[42:36] the Salvation is of the Jews which means
[42:38] the true and living God is the god of
[42:40] the
[42:42] Jews it has proven many many times that
[42:45] the only God the creator of Heaven and
[42:48] Earth is the god that the Jewish
[42:51] worship you can go back in Old Testament
[42:54] in the time of uh Elijah the tishbite
[42:58] at one point the children of Israel they
[42:59] were like confused between baale and and
[43:03] God he was like H how long are you guys
[43:06] going to be between uh uh two gods baale
[43:11] and the Lord God today I'm going to
[43:14] prove to you that the Lord God is the
[43:17] true and living God Amen he took them at
[43:20] the Mount of carel and you know about
[43:22] the
[43:23] story remember we're talking about
[43:25] fellowshipping I mean worship shiing in
[43:27] truth and in
[43:31] spirit brother bam says in this message
[43:34] as we before I come back to what I want
[43:38] to
[43:49] say he says in uh God's provided place
[43:53] of
[43:55] worship he said Jesus said in St John
[44:00] 4 the time is coming and now is when God
[44:04] being a spirit will be worshiped in
[44:08] spirit and in truth now some people have
[44:13] Spirit no truth others has truth and no
[44:19] Spirit you can go back in the time of
[44:21] Jesus when he was here on the earth with
[44:23] the
[44:24] disciples the Bible says
[44:28] in the beginning was the word the word
[44:31] was with God the Word was God and the
[44:34] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[44:38] Jesus was the word the disciples they
[44:40] had the word but he didn't receive this
[44:42] holy spirit
[44:44] yet they need to have both to be the
[44:47] true
[44:48] worshippers they had the word with them
[44:51] but the word was not in them they heard
[44:53] about the true word of God
[44:57] because we worship God in spirit and the
[45:00] truth the truth means the word of God
[45:02] because Jesus said father sanctify them
[45:05] by Your Word cuz the word is truth
[45:09] am
[45:11] so since the head only the word as the
[45:14] prophet says here some have the word
[45:17] they don't have the spirit some have the
[45:19] spirit they don't have the word so he
[45:22] told them before he left the Earth go ye
[45:25] Terry in Jerusalem and until you'll be
[45:27] filled with the power from on high we're
[45:30] talking about the spirit amen and when
[45:34] the spirit when he came down
[45:37] fully and Jesus which mean because he
[45:41] said lo I will leave you and I'll come
[45:43] back to you
[45:45] again right was the same
[45:48] Jesus he was in the body of Flesh he was
[45:51] still the word but for him to come and
[45:54] dwell in them he had to go to the form
[45:55] he was before
[45:57] spiritual form for him to come down and
[46:00] dwell in the
[46:01] disciples which he
[46:04] did and you can see Peter and all the
[46:09] disciples they act before the Holy
[46:11] Spirit and after receiving the holy
[46:14] spirit before receiving the Holy Spirit
[46:16] Peter could chop off the head the ear of
[46:19] the the Roman
[46:20] soldiers Jesus told them this is not the
[46:23] Battle of Flesh and Blood this is
[46:26] spiritual
[46:28] battle Peter could not understand that
[46:31] before receiving the Holy Spirit but
[46:33] after he received the Holy Spirit see
[46:34] him
[46:35] acting he was the true
[46:40] worshipper you go back to
[46:43] Paul Paul before he went to the word he
[46:46] received the spirit
[46:47] first he met the spirit on his way going
[46:51] to Damascus persecuting the
[46:53] Believers butam say about 11:00 in the
[46:56] morning
[46:57] the pill of fire appeared to
[47:01] him soul soul why are you persecuting me
[47:04] who are you
[47:06] Lord but bam says as a as a Jew he's
[47:09] supposed to know that the pill of fire
[47:11] is the
[47:13] Lord and then he asked him why are you
[47:16] persecuting
[47:17] me you see so when when Paul received
[47:21] the Holy SP when he met Jesus right
[47:23] there the Bible says he went back to 7
[47:29] went there start searching the
[47:31] scriptures he met the spirit first he
[47:34] didn't have the word he had to come and
[47:36] search the scriptures all right after he
[47:39] got both of them the spirit and the word
[47:42] he came out with one
[47:45] conclusion he said Jesus Christ is the
[47:47] same yesterday today and forever amen
[47:50] you see when you have both then you can
[47:54] be the true worshipper
[47:58] cuz if we don't have both then I don't
[48:03] know cuz it's supposed to be coming in
[48:05] to worship God the provided Way by
[48:16] himself so all of this it has to be a
[48:21] spiritual revealed
[48:24] truth but bam says this
[48:31] let's read the Bible first before we go
[48:32] to the
[48:38] prophet anyways he said
[48:41] the the true angel will always
[48:46] Point people to the
[48:48] word the true Angel amen do you believe
[48:51] William BR was a true
[48:54] Angel there's no
[48:57] body that has preached the deity of
[49:00] Jesus Christ like William brandham
[49:04] did he didn't attract people to
[49:09] himself and when you see William Bram
[49:11] making a statement go read it in the
[49:13] Bible you'll see it in the Bible
[49:15] somewhere he said the words always come
[49:17] to the prophet it's unto the prophet to
[49:19] introduce the word to the
[49:22] people Jesus says the word came to John
[49:25] the Baptist
[49:28] in the
[49:29] water and John the Baptist was the one
[49:31] that introduced the word to the
[49:38] people in Matthew chapter 16 verse 13
[49:47] to8 when Jesus came into the coast of
[49:51] cyria Phil
[49:54] Philippi he asked his dis IES saying
[49:59] whom who do men
[50:02] say that I the son of man
[50:06] am and they said some say that thou are
[50:10] John the Baptist some
[50:13] Elias and others
[50:16] Jeremiah or one of the prophets they say
[50:20] he said unto them but who say ye that I
[50:25] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[50:29] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[50:32] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[50:35] unto him blessed art thou Simon bonah
[50:39] for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it
[50:42] unto thee but my Father which is in
[50:45] heaven amen and I say also unto thee
[50:49] that thou art peaked Peter and Upon This
[50:52] Rock I will build my church and the Gate
[50:56] of hell shall not Prevail against
[50:59] it you see it has to be
[51:02] individual
[51:04] Revelation when he he asked the question
[51:06] to the disciples not all of them they
[51:08] stood up say okay is this this and this
[51:10] and that no one stood
[51:14] up it's
[51:16] individual
[51:19] Revelation and then he said upon this
[51:22] Revelation I will build my church
[51:27] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[51:29] against
[51:32] it and baram says since that time the
[51:35] time of Abel and Cain it
[51:39] always has it has always been the truth
[51:42] revealed by the
[51:44] spirit and the Church of God now is
[51:47] based on the
[51:49] Revelation coming by the
[51:52] spirit not all the Revelation but
[51:54] because bam says
[51:57] the greatest of all the
[52:00] revelations is the revelation of Jesus
[52:02] Christ who he
[52:04] is he says this
[52:12] in in the message the Patmos
[52:15] Vision paragraph
[52:18] 132 the greatest of all Revelations is
[52:21] the deity the Supreme deity of our Lord
[52:24] Jesus Christ you you can't be to first
[52:28] base until you believe
[52:30] that work out that's what Peter said
[52:34] repent and then see the
[52:37] deity be baptized in the name of the in
[52:41] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[52:43] remission of the sins and then you will
[52:47] you you you ready to get to go in the
[52:50] spirit the first thing you have to know
[52:53] is the deity of Christ amen
[52:57] I am Alpha and Omega I am from A to Z
[53:02] there is no more but me I was at the
[53:05] beginning I'll be at the
[53:08] end I'm he that was which is and shall
[53:12] come the
[53:14] mighty think of it that's what the
[53:18] trumpet
[53:20] said so to really become a true
[53:24] worshippers the first thing here as
[53:27] brother bam says you have to have the
[53:29] revelation of who is God because that
[53:31] was the question that Jesus even asked
[53:33] to the woman I mean that was the
[53:35] conversation between Jesus and the woman
[53:37] you are worshiping something that you
[53:39] don't know nothing about but we do know
[53:41] what we
[53:42] worship so as we're going through you
[53:44] will find out what we are worshiping
[53:47] even us this
[53:49] evening the first of the
[53:51] Revelation is to know who is God mainly
[53:55] who is Jesus Christ Christ when you know
[53:59] that then he will come into your heart
[54:03] and start building his own
[54:06] church if you go in the statute of of of
[54:10] a perfect man bam is talking about now
[54:13] we are going to talk about the Living
[54:16] Church of the Living God it's not these
[54:18] walls it's you
[54:21] individually the first of the thing is
[54:24] God has to come to you because he said
[54:27] if you love my
[54:29] word and my words abide in you and you
[54:33] love my father my father love you and
[54:35] then we can come and dwell in you amen
[54:39] one time ask a question how can uh the
[54:42] Believers go grow spiritually he said
[54:46] you have to read the word and
[54:50] pray you see and he
[54:54] says if you love my word
[54:57] and my words abides in
[54:59] you then I'll come to you with my father
[55:03] and we can make a dwelling place in your
[55:05] heart and when he comes in your heart he
[55:09] will start to do the job of a deacon as
[55:11] he did in the church in the
[55:13] temple cleaning your heart kicking out
[55:16] all the evil
[55:18] spirit the second thing is going to be
[55:22] Faith because without faith you can even
[55:24] please God the first thing is to know
[55:28] who is God to know Jesus Christ that's
[55:30] the greatest of all the
[55:32] Revelation when you know him he comes
[55:35] into your heart then he start building
[55:37] his
[55:38] church starting with faith that's why
[55:42] 1947 William brandham started with faith
[55:45] is is the substance that's the first
[55:48] message the first recorded message as
[55:51] far as I
[55:53] know faith is the substance
[55:57] and he start building faith in your
[55:59] heart but that Faith you cannot have it
[56:02] by just sitting down like that no the
[56:05] Bible says faith comes by hearing and
[56:08] hearing of the word of God you need to
[56:10] read your word I mean the word of God
[56:12] you need to be in a prayerful modood all
[56:14] the time that's how you can build up the
[56:16] faith and on the top of the faith you
[56:19] have
[56:20] virtues you have
[56:22] knowledge
[56:24] patience on and on until to brotherly
[56:28] love and to C off you have to have the
[56:30] perfect love amen which is God himself
[56:34] because bam says to go there you have to
[56:37] have the perfect faith and that started
[56:41] somewhere with the revelation of Jesus
[56:46] Christ otherwise you'll
[56:50] be worshiping God in
[56:54] vain because he didn't look at the the
[56:56] sacrifice of
[56:58] Cain you see our God is a good god even
[57:02] went to Cain told him you're supposed to
[57:05] be acting like your brother he was
[57:08] patient with
[57:10] him
[57:11] no because he was not the
[57:15] elect he didn't know what to do he had
[57:18] the altar but abam say the altar is the
[57:21] church and he put his flowers there and
[57:24] Bam says God doesn't need need your lies
[57:26] to be on the altar he need you to be on
[57:29] the
[57:30] altar to be identified with your
[57:32] sacrifice if you look at how Abel
[57:35] sacrificed how he brought his sacrifice
[57:38] he the BAM says he chopped off the head
[57:42] the the head of the uh the animal of the
[57:44] lamb and he was and Cain killed
[57:48] him able and his sacrifice were were
[57:51] were
[57:52] identified he died on the same altar
[57:56] with his
[57:57] sacrifice and B says when we come to the
[57:59] altar you need to come down God need you
[58:01] not your
[58:02] lies God needs you to come down and say
[58:05] Here I
[58:06] Am
[58:07] amen take out of the evil out of
[58:11] me so now you see this subject is very
[58:14] very
[58:18] important I was reading the trying to
[58:21] search this word of worship
[58:26] and I took the dictionaries the
[58:29] Websters I looked at the definitions
[58:32] it's a good fit for the subject Webster
[58:36] says worship
[58:39] means the re the uh the reverent love in
[58:43] Allegiance accorded a deity Idol or or a
[58:49] secred
[58:51] object and he goes on to say it's a set
[58:54] of religious forms
[58:56] is ceremonies prayers by which this love
[59:01] is
[59:05] expressed when Jesus ask him about the
[59:08] Commandment he started with the first
[59:10] commandment was
[59:13] love your God with all your mind all
[59:17] your soul all your spirit everything
[59:19] that is within you love
[59:21] him you see for you to worship something
[59:24] you need to love it
[59:29] and he says it's a set of all the forms
[59:33] religious forms ceremonies and prayers
[59:36] which we did here we sang we we prayed
[59:41] as part of
[59:47] worshiping and baram says you
[59:51] can worship something instead of God
[59:57] that's what Webster says here
[1:00:01] too because even is I say it didn't
[1:00:04] start here started in
[1:00:06] heaven Lucifer is not the
[1:00:09] Creator is a part of
[1:00:13] creation and if God has to hate
[1:00:18] something is worshiping something else
[1:00:20] instead of worshiping
[1:00:24] him wrong worshiping
[1:00:30] that's why the message we have
[1:00:33] received William brandham didn't come
[1:00:35] here with a message to attract people to
[1:00:39] himself he came here to United the
[1:00:42] people with
[1:00:44] God to establish the relationship
[1:00:47] between us as human being as Believers
[1:00:51] with God
[1:00:56] and then that's is the only thing that
[1:00:59] is going to make us a the true
[1:01:03] worshippers because now we worship what
[1:01:05] we
[1:01:06] know we worship
[1:01:09] God not only any God but we worship the
[1:01:12] creator of Heaven and the Earth and his
[1:01:15] name is Jesus Christ the sisters even
[1:01:18] sang here they said your name is above
[1:01:22] all names it's a good fit for this
[1:01:24] sermon because we talking about the
[1:01:26] deity of Jesus Christ and how to
[1:01:29] approach
[1:01:32] him
[1:01:35] worshipping is not something that we
[1:01:37] have to do when we come to
[1:01:39] church we should be in that mood in our
[1:01:43] daily
[1:01:46] life we can go down even in our
[1:01:49] prayers before we pray we don't have
[1:01:52] just to come God you know I need this I
[1:01:54] need that no no no no that's not a good
[1:01:58] approach you have to worship Him
[1:02:01] First telling him who he
[1:02:04] is what he did in your
[1:02:07] life not in the book what he did a long
[1:02:09] time ago no what he did in your
[1:02:13] life one one day I was when I was in
[1:02:15] Canada I was
[1:02:17] just meditating on uh on the word of God
[1:02:21] and looking at my life and the troubl
[1:02:23] sometimes I went through a lot of
[1:02:24] troubles with my cars and things
[1:02:27] sometimes I was something I was
[1:02:29] questioning myself why am I going
[1:02:31] through this you fix this this happen
[1:02:32] you do this this and a voice told
[1:02:36] me the Bible you are reading that's
[1:02:39] people's
[1:02:41] lives you are inspired by the life of
[1:02:44] somebody in the
[1:02:47] Bible okay you read Abraham went through
[1:02:52] trouble time 25 years waiting for a son
[1:02:55] to be be born so if you put yourself in
[1:02:58] his shoes to wait for 25 years for the
[1:03:00] son I don't know if you're going to
[1:03:02] handle that but he did handle
[1:03:06] that and something told me if God picks
[1:03:09] on you if he chooses you to bear this
[1:03:13] burden you just have to accept it
[1:03:15] because it's going to be for the
[1:03:16] blessings of some somebody
[1:03:19] else so when you pray worship Him
[1:03:23] First I remember one of
[1:03:26] my friends in the Congo his dad is a is
[1:03:28] a minister he's a pastor they were
[1:03:31] telling me that when
[1:03:33] the they need something from the dad
[1:03:36] they not just come any time no the wait
[1:03:39] when he's he prayed he prayed all day
[1:03:43] because they know his his schedule after
[1:03:46] he prayed and coming out of the prayer
[1:03:48] room then they can come to him dad can
[1:03:50] you give us money for this and that he's
[1:03:52] not going to
[1:03:54] resist because he's coming fresh from
[1:03:57] the presence of the Lord you know so if
[1:04:00] a human being can do that how much
[1:04:03] more the creator of Heaven and the Earth
[1:04:06] so when you start praying worship Him
[1:04:09] First tell him who he is what he
[1:04:13] did in your life in the lives of others
[1:04:16] too as
[1:04:17] well and then start telling him what you
[1:04:21] want so if you seee this uh this subject
[1:04:28] it all come to one
[1:04:30] thing because we talk about spirit and
[1:04:33] truth even the new
[1:04:35] birth Jesus said you need to be born and
[1:04:38] despite spirit and
[1:04:41] truth if you go back you find out the
[1:04:44] spirit is God himself because the Bible
[1:04:47] says God is spirit and those that are
[1:04:50] worshiping him have to worship Him in
[1:04:52] spirit and in truth amen the Bible say
[1:04:55] say at the beginning was the word the
[1:04:57] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:05:00] all is about
[1:05:05] God so the true and living God is the
[1:05:09] god of the
[1:05:11] Jews is the one that William Brandon
[1:05:14] presented to
[1:05:17] us he said to
[1:05:21] Peter Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this
[1:05:24] to you cuz flesh and blood can reveal
[1:05:27] you something you know that in Garden of
[1:05:33] Eden when when God preached to his
[1:05:36] church Adam and Eve he told them not to
[1:05:40] go by the way of sex for
[1:05:42] reproduction but when the enemy came he
[1:05:45] brought a different sound of a
[1:05:49] preaching telling them God
[1:05:52] lied that's exactly what we're
[1:05:54] experiencing in this entire time where
[1:05:56] people are attacking the message trying
[1:05:58] to find mistakes in the
[1:06:01] message but I wonder you know in life
[1:06:03] when you leave
[1:06:06] something to go to something else that
[1:06:09] something else has to be greater than
[1:06:10] the what you are
[1:06:12] living but if you follow closely those
[1:06:14] people that are attacking the message
[1:06:16] and leaving the message they go
[1:06:21] worse you see this man 38 years in the
[1:06:24] Bible
[1:06:29] he was
[1:06:30] crippled but when Jesus healed him the
[1:06:33] FES and the sides no no that guy is is
[1:06:36] an evil
[1:06:37] guy but he said you want to be his
[1:06:40] disciples too well I know is just he
[1:06:42] prayed for me and I'm healed
[1:06:46] amen this message that they claimed to
[1:06:48] be
[1:06:49] false when they were in the message they
[1:06:52] were living holy
[1:06:55] they kept the family
[1:06:57] together but when they leave this
[1:06:59] message they go
[1:07:02] worse when when when Satan talked to
[1:07:05] Adam and Eve they were Gods
[1:07:08] already but he came with a lie if you do
[1:07:11] such a thing you'll be like God and when
[1:07:14] they followed him in what he was saying
[1:07:16] they went
[1:07:18] worse
[1:07:20] follow I had a friend of
[1:07:24] mine he he's a husband to my my sister's
[1:07:28] uh my wife's sister in the Congo he's he
[1:07:31] used to be a deacon in uh in uh br's
[1:07:33] Church his his young brother is here in
[1:07:36] America he start listening to those
[1:07:39] teachings so when I was in Canada he was
[1:07:42] sending me some those videos and can you
[1:07:44] respond to me this is going on even the
[1:07:46] ministers are I say wait I I'll come to
[1:07:48] you I'm I'm
[1:07:50] out so when I came to him I was like
[1:07:53] brother this didn't start today is
[1:07:55] something that has been going on for
[1:07:57] since since you know humankind is here
[1:08:00] on the earth Satan did the same thing in
[1:08:02] the Garden of Eden right so when he sent
[1:08:06] me that video I saw the the brother he's
[1:08:10] he's used to be a pastor here in America
[1:08:12] his name is a team Hume something like
[1:08:15] that I saw him with the Bible and with
[1:08:18] another
[1:08:19] book that he got somewhere and that
[1:08:22] person was talking about wrong things
[1:08:25] about the message M was like now you see
[1:08:27] him he's reading getting inspiration
[1:08:31] from Flesh and
[1:08:34] Blood yes that's what it is because the
[1:08:37] person who wrote that the the book got
[1:08:40] inspiration from from
[1:08:44] who and in abandoning the message that's
[1:08:47] why we need to worship God in truth and
[1:08:51] in
[1:08:53] spirit my brothers and sisters I'm
[1:08:56] asking you and I'm praying for you if
[1:08:58] you haven't you haven't received this
[1:09:02] Revelation in your heart do whatever you
[1:09:05] can to be in a prayerful prayerful mode
[1:09:10] mood read the Bible until you receive
[1:09:13] the revelation of Jesus Christ otherwise
[1:09:16] down the road the enemy will present you
[1:09:19] a different
[1:09:21] Christ and you're not going to resist
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:26] look in the Bible
[1:09:28] Paul until he left this Earth he was
[1:09:32] together of Jesus Christ and he said
[1:09:35] what what can separate me from the love
[1:09:36] of
[1:09:38] God the pressures we are going through
[1:09:41] the suffering we are going through is
[1:09:43] for because of the wrong
[1:09:48] worshiping not only because of the wrong
[1:09:50] worshiping now because of we are
[1:09:52] resistant to the devil because he want
[1:09:54] us to worship Him him because we don't
[1:09:57] worship him he's on our cases bring all
[1:10:01] kind of
[1:10:04] persecutions and some people didn't
[1:10:06] resist because they didn't have
[1:10:08] revelation of Jesus
[1:10:11] Christ cuz once you have his Revelation
[1:10:14] he comes into you and the Bible says
[1:10:16] that's inside
[1:10:19] teacher even going into the marriage you
[1:10:21] need to have make sure you have the Holy
[1:10:24] Spirit make sure make sure you know who
[1:10:25] is God make sure you have him in his in
[1:10:28] your
[1:10:29] heart because when problem
[1:10:32] arise you'll be able to handle
[1:10:36] them because if you don't have him in
[1:10:38] your heart and she doesn't have him in
[1:10:41] her heart it's going to be trouble
[1:10:46] sometime but if both of you are filled
[1:10:49] of the Holy Spirit you can handle any
[1:10:53] situation many troubles and problems
[1:10:56] going through because we don't have that
[1:10:58] revelation of Jesus
[1:11:00] Christ and that Revelation doesn't have
[1:11:02] to come from a a preacher it has to come
[1:11:05] from God himself to your
[1:11:07] heart butam says
[1:11:10] in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:11:14] revealed this is paragraph
[1:11:17] 484 he says his
[1:11:19] presence in the
[1:11:21] individual with a personal Vindication
[1:11:25] of himself expressing himself The Living
[1:11:28] Word that's promised for the day
[1:11:31] expressing itself through you a
[1:11:35] Vindication of a great revelation of God
[1:11:40] look only in an individual never in a
[1:11:46] group an
[1:11:48] individual not in a
[1:11:50] group his identification is with
[1:11:56] is with Baptist
[1:12:04] Baptist you see it has to be the
[1:12:09] Revelation coming from Jesus Christ
[1:12:11] himself to you
[1:12:15] personally when he met Paul it was Paul
[1:12:17] Paul had a lot of people around him but
[1:12:21] says you can sometimes you can see him
[1:12:23] and either cannot see him or you can see
[1:12:25] him all all together when when when b b
[1:12:28] was preaching about the seven Church
[1:12:30] ages he appeared start drawing people
[1:12:34] screaming you can all see him one person
[1:12:37] can see him and others not but in that
[1:12:40] case Paul saw
[1:12:42] him you see and he received that
[1:12:46] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:12:49] was he didn't know him in the flesh when
[1:12:51] he was here on the earth Paul never met
[1:12:54] him
[1:12:55] but he knew him by the Revelation from
[1:12:59] the spirit of
[1:13:02] God and you look at the Peter even
[1:13:04] though he know him he knew him in the
[1:13:06] flesh but it behooves the Revelation
[1:13:09] from the
[1:13:11] spirit to bring the true revelation of
[1:13:15] Jesus Christ to
[1:13:16] Peter even though he knew him in the
[1:13:18] flesh but he has to have a revelation of
[1:13:21] who he is spiritually speaking amen
[1:13:24] because we're talking about the
[1:13:25] spiritual revealed
[1:13:29] truth and for some reason if you have a
[1:13:31] revelation
[1:13:35] somewhere it has to
[1:13:38] be in accordance with the word of
[1:13:42] God that's what Paul
[1:13:44] did he received that Revelation and he
[1:13:47] came read the Bible try to make sure it
[1:13:50] matches of the word try to make sure
[1:13:52] it's in the UR t
[1:13:57] if it's not here then I don't
[1:14:00] know it's something else and sometimes
[1:14:03] some people that make a mistake of
[1:14:05] taking one one quotation in the Bible
[1:14:09] something mean in in uh isolating it you
[1:14:16] know and take a Doctrine out of
[1:14:20] that it doesn't have to be
[1:14:22] isolated you have to find it from
[1:14:25] Genesis to
[1:14:28] Revelation it's like a
[1:14:30] chain you have to see it here there here
[1:14:33] there that's why the prophet of God is
[1:14:36] saying here in
[1:14:44] um in the
[1:14:47] message the pmos vision part
[1:14:51] two the prophet of God says this
[1:14:58] I was in the spirit let me just start
[1:15:00] from
[1:15:01] there I was in the spirit isn't that
[1:15:04] just beautiful my I love
[1:15:08] that you could just call those words the
[1:15:12] whole of the Christian
[1:15:14] Life if we are going to live as
[1:15:18] Christians we have to be in his
[1:15:21] Spirit John was not talking about being
[1:15:24] in his own
[1:15:25] spirit that would have not have brought
[1:15:29] these
[1:15:30] Visions it had to be the spirit of God
[1:15:34] it has to be the spirit of God with us
[1:15:37] too or all our efforts are in vain Paul
[1:15:42] said I will pray in spirit I will sing
[1:15:46] in
[1:15:47] spirit I will live in
[1:15:50] spirit if there is anything good that
[1:15:54] will come to me it has to be revealed by
[1:15:58] the spirit confirmed by the word
[1:16:03] am you see confirmed by the word and
[1:16:07] made manifest by the result it
[1:16:11] Bears let's take those people
[1:16:13] criticizing the
[1:16:15] message whatever they claim to have to
[1:16:18] be as a
[1:16:20] revelation of wrong things about the
[1:16:23] message
[1:16:27] that's the Revelation it didn't come
[1:16:28] from the spirit of God it came from
[1:16:30] somewhere you know if it's not God it
[1:16:32] has to be the
[1:16:34] devil and brother bam says it has to be
[1:16:38] a revelation has to come from the Holy
[1:16:40] Spirit from the spirit of God itself and
[1:16:43] you have to be Vindicated by the word
[1:16:46] and look at the the
[1:16:48] result the life after
[1:16:51] that you can understand the source of
[1:16:53] inspiration
[1:16:55] you see people one time they were in the
[1:16:58] message living holy living good life and
[1:17:01] all of a sudden they receive another
[1:17:03] inspiration from somewhere see the
[1:17:06] result after
[1:17:07] that but whatam says this
[1:17:10] here you can understand you can tell
[1:17:12] exactly where that inspiration came
[1:17:15] from because he says if there's anything
[1:17:18] good it has to be revealed by the spirit
[1:17:20] of God Vindicated by the word and see
[1:17:23] the result of it
[1:17:28] as surely as John needed to be in the
[1:17:32] spirit to receive these tremendous
[1:17:35] Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to
[1:17:38] be in
[1:17:40] spirit to understand the revelations
[1:17:44] that God has given to us to live by in
[1:17:47] his word for it for it is the same
[1:17:52] spirit
[1:17:56] the Bible says men of men of
[1:18:00] old they wrote the Bible they wrote the
[1:18:03] Bible by inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:18:07] amen how in the world are you expecting
[1:18:09] to
[1:18:10] understand just like that the scriptures
[1:18:13] that was inspired by the Holy Spirit you
[1:18:15] without the Holy Spirit try to
[1:18:17] understand that he can't fly you have to
[1:18:21] have the same Spirit you have to be in
[1:18:24] the spirit of the
[1:18:27] composer otherwise you'll
[1:18:30] be going in all kind of directions I
[1:18:33] remember one time uh I think is about
[1:18:39] um what
[1:18:44] um not
[1:18:49] John one of the ministers in Canada his
[1:18:52] name kind of um I can't remember his
[1:18:55] name right right now but he was
[1:18:57] mentioning something uh about when he
[1:18:59] was in uh High School his music teacher
[1:19:03] gave them a song and to repeat on and so
[1:19:06] the day of
[1:19:09] singing he didn't practice
[1:19:12] well so he was
[1:19:14] there among the other
[1:19:17] students and the teacher was just
[1:19:19] observing them play I me sing start
[1:19:23] singing and he said he pretend to have
[1:19:26] blown his trumpet but he didn't really
[1:19:29] he was just doing this to lie the
[1:19:32] teacher you see but the teacher knew
[1:19:35] that he didn't play his
[1:19:38] part he was not in the spirit of the
[1:19:41] composer you see he was lying he pretend
[1:19:46] to have played but he didn't do his
[1:19:48] job so if you cannot fool a human being
[1:19:52] how much more God right all right
[1:19:55] right you have to have his
[1:19:58] Spirit you have to have him in your life
[1:20:02] yes that's the first and the greatest of
[1:20:05] the Revelation who is
[1:20:08] God that way you can be a true
[1:20:11] worshipper because if you go over the
[1:20:14] Pentecostal they will tell you they are
[1:20:16] worshiping God they even pray day and
[1:20:18] night you can go start talking to them
[1:20:21] about Jesus down the road you find out
[1:20:24] they have three
[1:20:26] Gods some of them they will tell you
[1:20:28] Jesus is not God at some point but you
[1:20:31] and I have
[1:20:33] received a message that has fully
[1:20:36] explained to us who Jesus Christ
[1:20:40] is we have all the tools to make us the
[1:20:44] true worshippers amen there's no
[1:20:49] excuses we have the prophet have laid
[1:20:52] out everything exact exactly like
[1:20:56] Moses in all aspects of Life Moses
[1:20:59] brought the the
[1:21:03] clarification whether it's a marriage
[1:21:05] and divorce or this and that same in
[1:21:08] this end time remember before Moses
[1:21:13] wrote the Bible the four the first five
[1:21:15] books of the Bible he had to meet the
[1:21:18] pillow
[1:21:21] fire okay when Paul
[1:21:24] before he wrote in the New Testament he
[1:21:26] had to meet with the pill of
[1:21:28] fire in this end time the prophet that
[1:21:32] have that we have received you and I the
[1:21:35] first of the things has to
[1:21:37] receive the pill of fire am he did not
[1:21:41] bring the interpretation of the Bible
[1:21:44] based on his own knowledge no he was in
[1:21:47] the contact with the
[1:21:50] spirit same as Moses same as Paul
[1:21:54] so you and I are not excused we need to
[1:21:57] find the Same
[1:21:59] Spirit how do we find it by reading his
[1:22:02] word
[1:22:04] praying cuz he says if my words abides
[1:22:09] in
[1:22:10] you okay then I reveal myself cuz he
[1:22:15] cannot reveal himself to you if you're
[1:22:17] not interested in that you don't read
[1:22:20] his word you don't come to church you
[1:22:21] don't pray how can he reveal to you
[1:22:25] yes you need to show the
[1:22:27] interest reading his word praying now he
[1:22:30] can tell you love him brother Paul loves
[1:22:33] me now I can reveal myself to him amen
[1:22:37] not only reveal myself to him I can make
[1:22:39] my Dwelling Place in his heart not only
[1:22:42] that I can do the job of a deacon
[1:22:44] kicking out all the evil
[1:22:47] spirit instead building my own church
[1:22:51] amen brothers and sisters if we have
[1:22:55] God Jesus Christ in our heart we're
[1:22:57] going to be the strong Living Church of
[1:23:02] God because the church is not these
[1:23:04] walls but it's him and him only in our
[1:23:09] heart
[1:23:11] amen by the way of the truth revealed by
[1:23:17] his
[1:23:19] Spirit outside of that I don't know
[1:23:22] we'll be wasting our time
[1:23:25] but I believe from the bottom of my
[1:23:28] heart that this message has all it takes
[1:23:33] for us to make it
[1:23:36] through and I believe that with these
[1:23:40] words of
[1:23:44] exhortation God will help
[1:23:47] us to even dig in his word by the help
[1:23:54] of of the holy spirit cuz brother bam
[1:23:55] says
[1:23:57] here God with his
[1:24:01] Mercy through the
[1:24:04] operation of the holy spirit will reveal
[1:24:08] the truth to his
[1:24:12] people there's a some point that I want
[1:24:14] to make
[1:24:15] here you see that's the mercy of
[1:24:18] God that he has shown to brother Joshua
[1:24:21] that he has shown to brother
[1:24:23] Ron to to give you a
[1:24:25] revelation you can't BST your
[1:24:29] chest he was given to you by
[1:24:36] Mercy God was patient with you when you
[1:24:38] didn't know about this Revelation amen
[1:24:42] you can be too much on someone else you
[1:24:44] you you can't force him no be patient
[1:24:47] with him too amen because you you
[1:24:51] receive that Revelation by Mercy
[1:24:54] by the grace of
[1:24:56] God through the operation of his holy
[1:25:01] spirit you need to be
[1:25:04] patient with one
[1:25:08] another so if you see someone boasting
[1:25:11] his chur disfellowshipping people and
[1:25:14] christianizing other people you can tell
[1:25:17] he didn't receive that by
[1:25:19] Mercy it's something that he didn't even
[1:25:21] receive as as Revelation it's something
[1:25:23] that he pretended to be
[1:25:25] Revelation because if it was given to
[1:25:27] him by Mercy if it was given to him by
[1:25:30] God he would have been patient with
[1:25:33] others you get
[1:25:37] it because if you receive that God is in
[1:25:40] you he start building his
[1:25:44] church revelation of Jesus Christ Faith
[1:25:48] virtue patience knowledge
[1:25:51] whatever you have that in your heart you
[1:25:54] be be applying the same application to
[1:26:02] others I believe that I'm standing in
[1:26:05] the presence of the True Believers and
[1:26:08] the true
[1:26:10] worshippers that are worshiping in truth
[1:26:13] and in spirit if that is not the case my
[1:26:17] prayers tonight is for you to go on your
[1:26:21] knees
[1:26:24] and read the
[1:26:27] Bible outside of that there's no any
[1:26:29] other Miracle you can make it's just
[1:26:32] love him cuz he said if you love
[1:26:35] me you read his
[1:26:37] word you
[1:26:39] Fellowship you
[1:26:41] pray that's how he can tell you are
[1:26:43] interested in him you have the love of
[1:26:46] God and he will reveal himself to
[1:26:50] you and make you a true and living
[1:26:54] Church of
[1:26:55] God because the true Living Church of
[1:26:57] God is Not these walls it's you and
[1:27:03] I cuz the time we are living in it's a
[1:27:06] critical
[1:27:08] time you see many Elders in the message
[1:27:12] leaving this
[1:27:14] Earth it's it's a big sign it's not
[1:27:17] something that we need to take her
[1:27:18] positively like would be negligent to
[1:27:21] that no there's a message that God want
[1:27:23] to to
[1:27:26] us we have few of them left among which
[1:27:29] we have our
[1:27:33] pastor for us to receive the Gospel of
[1:27:37] Jesus Christ the Jews because the God we
[1:27:40] are we are worshiping is the god of the
[1:27:42] Jews Like Jesus
[1:27:44] said they have to reject him for us to
[1:27:48] receive him it's going to be the other
[1:27:50] way around you see how people are
[1:27:53] rejecting the message slow
[1:27:55] we have to reject him for them to
[1:27:56] receive him and it's going to be the end
[1:27:58] of
[1:28:00] it I don't think things will get better
[1:28:03] it get worse and worse it's up to us to
[1:28:06] hang
[1:28:08] tight because these voices that are
[1:28:12] bringing us into the line they are
[1:28:13] leaving
[1:28:15] us it's going to be like another
[1:28:18] generation that didn't know Joseph will
[1:28:20] arise another generation that didn't
[1:28:22] know the message will arise
[1:28:27] yes we are exactly heading to that
[1:28:32] direction and you see how some some many
[1:28:36] some other you know men of God are
[1:28:38] making some statements on you can see on
[1:28:42] YouTube and You' be shocked with why how
[1:28:44] how did he say
[1:28:45] this and for me those statements are
[1:28:49] preparing people to go down in
[1:28:51] hell if you are not careful
[1:28:54] yeah because the the the feble spirit
[1:28:58] will tell okay this is Brother R saying
[1:29:01] this you see they'll take
[1:29:05] it because of the the the uh the
[1:29:10] reputation of the
[1:29:12] minister they're not going to look into
[1:29:14] the Bible they're not going to look into
[1:29:15] the word to find out is this true no no
[1:29:18] they'll follow that because of the the
[1:29:20] reputation of the
[1:29:22] man so statements like that we have them
[1:29:25] a
[1:29:26] lot in the message
[1:29:30] today also my prayers
[1:29:33] is for us to help our
[1:29:37] children to be in the same pathway as we
[1:29:42] are I remember my son Malachi one time
[1:29:45] they uh I believe it was his uh
[1:29:48] birthday the the man oh no we need to go
[1:29:51] to the water fountain somewhere like
[1:29:53] okay let's go we got there and then all
[1:29:55] of them they had sh I was like how
[1:29:59] come I told him did you get baptized he
[1:30:02] say
[1:30:03] yes I said when you get baptized you are
[1:30:06] responsible to leave the word of God
[1:30:11] fully you are a brother you can't put
[1:30:13] the short
[1:30:15] on
[1:30:18] regardless you don't have to live in the
[1:30:21] flesh live in spirit
[1:30:25] amen you see I told him you you you you
[1:30:28] were baptized you need to be you are a
[1:30:31] brother can't put children on because oh
[1:30:34] no I'm I'm no no you are a brother even
[1:30:37] though you are my son you are a brother
[1:30:38] in
[1:30:41] Christ musician if you can work make
[1:30:43] your way up
[1:30:46] here so I believe
[1:30:48] these words of
[1:30:50] exhalation have done something to your
[1:30:52] heart uh and pray for
[1:30:55] me as we are digging to into the word
[1:30:59] whatever God will give to us as a
[1:31:03] revelation we'll go through the Bible
[1:31:05] through the message be
[1:31:07] [Music]
