turn with me to the Book of Exodus chapter 3 and we'll read verses 3-6 we just greet you all this evening in the name of Jesus Christ and it's certainly good to see you all out and uh it gets kind of nerve-wracking in the back because when you're when you're looking you know and it's like 7:20 you see all these empty chairs up front and then you're thinking oh my goodness no one's going to be here tonight and then you step out and everybody's here that makes you feel real good so God bless you for making me feel real good tonight uh ministering the gospel is the highest of highs and the lowest of lows I tell you and um and we just we just Rejoice with the Cleveland Family and uh you know he rang the bell what does it mean that he got to ring the bell it means that he's cancer free it means that whatever was there before God has taken away and he has healed him he's restored him his sight and for that we Rejoice praise the Lord yeah he's a special little boy Exodus 3: 3-6 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared onto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the Bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called onto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I notice that Moses had to take a step in the right direction in order for God to speak to him from the bush in order for God to speak to him from the fire Moses had something to do amen so it is with you and I God has expecting us to take a step towards him in order for him to speak to us and and the Lord saw that he turned aside and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look look upon God what a reverence he had amen you all may be seated this evening may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word I would like to take for a subject this evening and call it when Moses turned aside it was a great time of Affliction at that time for the Hebrews uh when Moses was first born uh the Hebrews had been in slavery for many years to the Egyptians and and Pharaoh's desire was that uh that all of the the newborn the newborn male babies that was born to the Hebrew mothers that that they would be slain and that they would be killed and and we see here that um you know the reason that he was doing that was because he he was scared of the Hebrews uh whenever the Hebrew uh the people Patriarchs there first went into Egypt and everything we realized that they were small in number but as they began to grow and and to multiply and as there was a a new King in the land or a new Pharaoh whatever you want to call him who was raised up who knew not Joseph and he knew not the ways of God and and all of a sudden he he got scared and he said well if if there's a war and and these men of Israel turn against us we're doomed so I have this great plan that we're going to take care of a a whole generation of Hebrew men that are born and we're going to slay them and we're going to kill them because against popular belief of the world that we're living in today uh it takes a male in order to reproduce a human being typically it's the males that uh are the ones who stand up in times of War typically it's the males that are the ones who stand upon their convictions and it's the males are the ones that whenever's there's something to say they're not scared to say it I'm talking about a real man a real man that that stands up for what he believes in a man that's not scared to go to war for his family for his country and for his people a man that's not scared to stand toe to- Toe with the people that he cares about in order to see them through trials and tribulations and situations in their lives that's what real men do it wasn't the women that went out at times of War otherwise when David and his men went out at War you remember the story they were all out and they were fighting and they came back to camp and who was gone that was once there the women the children why were the women and children not out to war because a woman is not designed to go to war right the woman is made to be a keeper of the home and and all those different things but now we've we've got it so perverted in the day and hour in which we're living in where now the women are the ones who are stepping up the women are the ones who are wanting to go to war the women are the ones who whenever there's something to say they want to be the ones that say it why is this it used to be the man that used to do these things it's because Satan has perverted the ways of God so in order what Pharaoh was was trying to do he was really thinking of the future and he thought if I will just slay these uh these these male Hebrew boys I can do away with the man of the future I can do away with the fighters of the future I can do away with the with the heads of the home of the future they weren't going to slay the women it was the man that he was trying to slay it was the man that he was trying to do with because he knew if he could do away with the men he'll have control of the women so now we can take this down into the day and hour in which we're living in we are living in a time right now where the whole world society and governments around the world are trying to do away with manhood why are they trying to do away with manhood what is wrong with a man because a man will stand upon his convictions a man will fight for what he believes in he won't he won't shy away and just not say anything so they know if they can do away with the manhood they can control the society that's why now they've got a bunch of they they're they're brainwashing let me say it that way they're brainwashing our children from an early age to say if you don't feel like a boy you can be a girl why are they saying this because they're trying to do away with manhood so that there will come a time and if the Lord carries in a generation or two to come that manhood will be totally destroyed manhood will be completely done away with and those who are real men will be seen as narcissists or whatever name you want to give it oh this guy's in the he's he's he's old school this guy's a woman hater this guy's this no this guy's just a real man but why are they doing it they're trying to do it because they want complete control of society and if they can get the man to lower their standards right if they can get the man to lower themselves down to just be a complete pushover and sand do whatever anybody wants them to sand do they have control of everything God help us huh what an evil perverted time we are living in why are they doing this because there's an agenda transgenderism it's just something that they're using to push that's right but there's a bigger picture that's going on behind the scenes that that we know know something's going on we know something is being planned but we don't know exactly what it is God wants men to be real men not only does he want us to be real men but he wants us to be God-fearing men God-fearing men that'll hold a standard in our homes God-fearing men that'll tell the truth even when it hurts to her kids or to her wife God-fearing men that'll stand for what's right even when the government says it's wrong watch this Satan zeden in 1965 brother brandham he says and now she has got her atom to wearing her underneath clothes a man put on them little old looking shorts and get out there and and I don't think there's much man to him he's the biggest I know of see she she's got she's got her perverted adom to act like she see now this is back in 1965 I wonder if brother brandham would was alive now what he would say about society and about manhood and about the things that's going on in this world today I tell you one thing he wouldn't say nothing about it he'd have something to say see she's got her perverted Adam Delight to act like she wearing her underneath clothes she seen what she could do out yonder when she took off all her clothes but her but her underneath ones that's the shorts of course that's the woman's underneath clothes and here her Adam is wearing them now which according to God's original word is abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man and a man to put on a garment that pertains to a woman from the original word think of it now he wears her bangs also he Combs him down puts a curler in them some of the most sickly sights I've ever seen in my life is some of those kids out here today with their bangs comb down like this and colored bleached hair with some kind of a peroxide or something and bleach their hair and rolling it in curlers making bangs you big you know what's so funny about that I had the best blonde tips in Ireland at one point I had blonde tips I went one step further cuz everybody copied me in our little village and I got red tips in with my blonde tips and I just thought I was the coolest kid on the Block but here's Brother bradam s I was nothing but a big old wearing shorts bleach tips in my hair God have mercy had my hair parted like David Beckham not as long as brother Ron's hair but it was pretty good I thought if I have my hair just like his and I wear the number seven shirt and I wear the the Predator adidad shoes Adidas I'll play just like beam didn't happen that was nothing but a can you believe that amen and as we look out in the world today that's all we see pretty boys all we see is these these band boys boys and they got these these these hair and it's flicked up and and and they look so pretty like a pretty little girl ain't supposed to be pretty supposed to be men notice this I think this is just it's amazing hell that history repeats itself isn't it he said peroxide or something rolling it in curlers making bangs you big that's a horrible thing to sa from the pulpit but judgment begins at the house of God you don't even know whether you're a man or a woman and I understand that our United States Army is coming out next in shorts that's right see what the perversion is it's a woman's clothes where her bangs the other day I was over Howard Johnson's he says not this one but the one down the road I I sat back in amazement here come a little boy along his mouth open and he had dark hair here and had combed over this away and put a roller in it and curled it up around top of his top of his eyes looking out the top of his eyes going around if I ever seen a perversion see he wouldn't believe it he could prove maybe he was male but in his Spirit he is female he don't know what side of the house he belongs to that's right how perverted That's what Satan does so who does this it's Satan he says they could prove that they were men all day if they want to but in their Spirit they have a feminine Spirit why because they're doing their hair like she's doing her hair he's wearing her underneath garments and because of this perversion there's something in the inside that's not right so God help us because the things that we see the things that we wear how we do her hair and all these different things it has an effect on our natural man though we would say not me I'm not perverted but yet in our spirit in our spirit something's happening he said brother Stephen what why are you saying these things because I see it in the world and when you see it in the world it's not too long before it creeps into the church and it's a spirit and so if we can go after the spirit before it takes off in full flight God can take care of it so you say brother Stephen does it make a difference absolutely it makes a massive difference it'll make a difference how we how we dress and conduct ourselves guys let me tell you something it'll affect your spiritual walk with Christ if we're doing wrong and we're acting wrong and we're dressing wrong and and we're doing all these different things guess what it's going to affect our walk with Christ and so if we want to freshen up if we want to get closer with God guess what there's a good place to start and that's right here take a look at ourselves in the mirror and say how do I look how's my hair am I am I am I looking like the world or am I looking like a Christian am I looking like a as brother Brandon would put it or am I looking like a a young man that loves Jesus Christ because they look completely different when we get ourselves right hallelujah our walk with cl will be closer amen absolutely no different than with our sisters if we're on borderline all the time guess what we're going to be a borderline believer in all our walk with God if we're borderline in our dress if we're borderline and how we look guess what our walk with God is going to be borderline but if our life and how we dress and how we act as Holiness and modesty guess what's going to happen we're going to have a closer walk with God and that's what we all want he says That's what Satan does he perverts the Nations he perverts the church he perverts the people he is a deceiver a perverter of the original truth my so what does he want to do he wants to pervert us but let us be real man amen let us stand for truth let us stand behind what the prophet of God says and say though this hurts it hurts in my spirit it hurts in my heart it hurts but I say Amen Lord I've had to say it many a time and and I'll have to continue to say Lord that hurts but I accept it so it was at this time that Moses was born it was a time of slavery and bondage and the Bible said that the Egyptians made them to serve with rigor uh rigor means to break apart to fracture that is with severity or cruelty to say that the Hebrew people were living in a very harsh environment and a very hard time uh is an under statement and we can see that um how they were treated at that time and they were treated so severely and they were treated very harshly and they were treated very cruly and Lally because they uh Pharaoh was trying to get their their structure to their their beliefs to fracture within themselves that they would just become a slave to whatever they said if Satan can get you to fracture through a little bit of persecution through a little bit of hardships you know what it's going to do it's going to fracture your faith in God that you'll not want to walk anymore in these ways well this is just slavery understand God hasn't made us to be slaves to anything right but God has made us free amen but it's up to us to accept the freedom of our Liberty that he has given to us and so Satan he wants to pervert us he wants to pervert the people he wants to pervert the church he wants to pervert the word why because he is the original perverter and so if he can get us off and he can get us off in our spiritual walk guess what he's won the fight in our lives so we see that at the first coming of Moses they were in slavery they were in bondage they were having hard times and they were being persecuted and whipped and so on and so forth you know I I uh I saw this thing the other day and it was of a a little cup and um it had a had a bunch of gats in it flies whatever they were and it had a lid on it and you can see these little gats and these little flies were trying to jump they were trying to fly and get out of this thing and every time they would jump up they would hit the thing and they would drop and they would fly and and and you could just see these little these little guys are just going like this up and down up and down up and down until finally the person they took the lid and they took the lid off of it and you know those little gnats or those little Flies what they did they only went up as far as it was before with the lid on and they didn't realize that the lid was off and and they and they and they had the opportunity to be free in Christ they had the opportunity to get out of the bondage and to get out of the slavery and to get out of those things but because they were so accustomed to the environment that they were in they got used to only going so high I want to tell you that you can go a whole lot higher than what you're going right now I don't care how many times you've failed I don't care how many times that you've tried I don't care how many times you've only jumped so high but I'm telling you that the Bible said to come up hither I want you to come up higher cuz I want to show you things that are to come so don't get accustomed to your faults and failures of yesterday and today but God is telling you to come on up higher and if he summoned you to come on up higher he's made a way for you to do it amen you are designed to go higher than what you're going right now you are designed to fly and the soar in the skies Like an Eagle just spread your wings little Eagle it's time to get out of the nest it's time to get out of your comfort zone a little bit it's time to spread your wings it's time to take a jump a leap of faith and and and stop relying on other people to encourage you but encourage yourself in the Lord yes I think that's why things are getting a little turbulent right now and we're we're getting antsy there's a there's an antsiness about us there there there's something that we know is is is is is happening and and the more news that you read it's bad news and the more articles that you read not it's bad and it's all just dooming it's all just Gloom spend your time in the good news instead of listening to Satan of telling you who you're not read and see who you are so we see that it was it was it was Moses at this time that was born and how they were being treated at that time and it was almost like a time of tribulation for the Jewish people and we see that when Moses comes again with Elijah that it is a time of tribulation as it was back then and but this time when Moses and Elijah come they're going to come and they're going to preach the same gospel that you and I believe today and what is it going to do it's going to take their hearts and turn it to Jesus Christ the Feast of the trumpets brother brandham says Moses and Elijah has got to call the Pentecostal Jubilee is still going or had up till this time see now the Feast of trumpets has to be known and this one over here of Malachi 4 is not connected with that one over there no not at all notice watch here the ministry will be Moses and Elijah changing and calling Israel from the Jewish Traditions listen from Jewish Traditions that they had been mixed up in what kind of traditions traditions of the red he for instance now they're coming back to their old traditions where they're trying to go back to uh to the atonement and to the to the time of the slaying of the red heer and the sprinkling of the blood and all these different things but when Moses and Elijah come they're going to take them away from the Traditions that they're used to and they're going to point them to Jesus Christ because he is all their Traditions wrapped up in one he says being prophets they'll believe him calling them to the Feast of atonement Christ letting them recognize Christ they'll say he is coming he'll be here the Jews will be gathering things like that when did it all start it all started when they became a nation in 1946 and now God has slowly been working and slowly been with Israel through all the wars and through all the different things that they have been through and let me say this he may not have turned to them completely but God is with Israel what will Moses and Elijah do at this time of tribulation he'll take them and they'll Point them to Jesus Christ what we are seeing with the attack on Israel and October 11th what is it it's pre-tribulation Spirits what are we seeing amongst us worldwide now in the western civilization with all the college campuses and all those different things we're seeing an absolute uprise in anti-Semitism what are they doing what are they protesting against they're protesting against the chosen of God they're protesting against the ones that God has said they are my people and here they are they're they're they're on their college campuses and they're saying away with Israel they're saying gas the Jews and all all these different horri horrible horrible things and nobody's doing a single thing about it people can just say what they want and get away with it they can just come against the people of God and nothing's ever said about it they can say gas the Jews kill every one of them get them out of here I let me ask you a question where is this hatred coming from it is a pre-tribulation spirit that is rising up within the people right now and what is it doing it is coming against the children of Israel though all they were doing is protecting themselves did any of you see what President Biden just did the other day he put a pause on 3,500 bombs to go to Israel y why would he do so such a thing I thought America was with Israel I thought we stand with Israel I thought we'll protect Israel at any cost slowly but surely right she's starting to back away so as us as Believers yeah we've we've seen we've already seen our sign our hearts have already been turned but what should this be doing to us we should be saying I know what this is and I know where this is leading to you better get serious with God they're slowly backing away we're going to put a pause on this because of humanitarianism wow but yet they don't do anything whenever there's a bunch of college students and they take an American flag down and they put a Hamas flag up where are we at where are we in society none of us really go to college does any of you guys go to college they had it here at ASU they had all these protests we should all go down and see what it's like I want to stay as far away from that as I possibly can but understand this brother Braden preaches a series and he says Israel and the church so whatever happens to Israel it's a type of what's going to happen with the church so if they're rising up against Israel and they're rising up with anti-Semitism and they're rising up and all these different things what are they going to do with the rights of us as Believers brother brandham says they'll shut our doors it's becoming more of a reality every day that we live than it was was 10 15 years ago say there's no way they'll shut our doors Prov Co proved different right they shut him they tried to have church brother Steve Brant in Quebec it was a Skeleton Crew The Neighbors complained police came in told them all to get out he say well we won't have a church we'll just have it at our house my my my my my we'll go into a field we'll go somewhere where they'll never get us you're right ain't happening Brother Stephen what are you trying to say I'm trying to show us where we're at modern events that are being made clear by prophecy we're seeing where we're at in the time piece of God and it shouldn't put us into fear because guess what it is a it is a great it is a dreadful day it is a fearful day for those who are not in Christ Jesus for those who haven't been sealed of God who aren't ready for a second coming who aren't ready for a body change guess what it's an absolute Dreadful and fearful day but for the believer for those who have been born by a spirit for those who have been sealed by his holy ghost for those who are watching and waiting ready for a Rapture it's a great day so let me ask you this evening what kind of day is it for you is it a great day or is it a dreadful day only you know in your heart of hearts and let me say this if in your heart of hearts you're saying I don't know it sure feels like a dreadful day you got time because there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat there's still blood there's still Grace there's still Mercy he's still there there's still time I'm thankful for that you know why because I got family members who aren't saved I got children that need to have an experience with God the same kind of experience that I had that changed their lives amen that's a scary thing isn't it you know uh will our kids go in the Rapture well brother Bram said if they're predestined to it and then you begin to think man Mama dad's gone and then where's our little ones what happens you don't even want to think about it and I just say this by faith that the grace of God is greater than my fear of my kids he said I'll give you and your family and to your children and to your children's children that's the kind of gospel that I want to believe a positive gospel not a gospel that leaves me in fear of the not unknowing and jobed saw the conditions around her she didn't go to fearing but rather it put her into action she she made a basket out of bull rush bull rush and she sealed it with pitch on the outside side this is Moses's mother when Moses was born though she was living in a time of turmoil though she was living in a time of slavery and bondage and and all these different things and that if her little boy was ever found he'd be slayed she didn't fear right but she got into action right because she knew that he was a a goodly boy she knew that there was something special about him so she prepared him a little basket the the Bible says she prepared an ark and she took that Ark and she placed a little boy within it and she put it down the River Nile a river that was full of crocodiles a river that was full of things that could have eat them up real good a river to where if there was soldiers around and they would see something floating down the river perhaps they would get it and they would do what they want with this little Moses in this little Ark but she didn't think about those things she got into action because she believed God and so she put him down this River Nile though it was dangerous and everything else but her faith in God Almighty was greater than her fear of her surroundings and she knew if she would just get him out there that God would take him to the right place because God had a purpose for his life so it is with you and I God has a purpose for us in our lives when we look at the world around us we don't need to fear about those things because God is in control yes right she had a revelation from God that God was going to use this little boy he was a goodly boy she knew that God had all things in control he's got it all in control amen he's got it all in control he put this reassurance many of you are reassured tonight that God has all things in control amen all things yes what is she she was the type of the church telling us to put our needs in the Arc of God's word because it's only in the ark of of God's word that we have safety it's only in the ark of God's word where our needs can be met so if you have a wayward loved one a mom a dad a son a daughter a cousin whatever it may be put them wrap them up in the Arc of God's word and just give it to God and let God have his way and let God take control because fearing over it and worrying over it doesn't do anything but bring anxiety in our bodies and bring sickness into our lives I want you to call out somebody's name within your heart right now somebody that you know is not doing what they should be doing somebody that you know is in a backsliding state I don't care who it is I don't care of the situation I want you to call out their name in your heart and place them within the word of God and say God they are yours and they are yours for your Kingdom's Glory I don't care what's in the River Nile I don't care of circumstances and things that's around us father I'm placing them in your word Lord have your way give it to God and watch God take control give it to God and watch God work on their lives give it to God and watch God work work on our situations amen put it in the ark of God's word and God will take care of the rest it was good enough for the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace if God was good enough for them God is good enough for me if God was good enough for Daniel in the Lion's Den he still good enough today if God was good enough for Noah to prepare an ark for the saving of his family God is still good enough today if God was good enough to give a man back his sight God is still good enough today if God was good enough to make a lame man walk God is still good enough today that's good enough for me if God was good enough to heal a woman with a blood issue let me tell you something God is still good enough today if God was good enough to give salvation to a PO woman Sons God is still good enough [Applause] today and that's good enough for me if you got a mountain in your life let me tell you God is good enough yes he is and that's good enough for me amen if you got a river that seems uncrossable God can part those Waters why because he's a never ever changing God and he's still the same today as he was back then and that's good enough for me is that good enough for you H Allelujah Moses was raised in the house of Pharaoh's daughter till he came to a place where he had to make a decision of who he truly was himself Hebrews 11:24 through 27 by faith Moses when he was come to years he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches the reproach of Christ greater riches amen than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect onto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible the trials of this life you know what it is it's greater riches going the Lord's going the straight and narrow way with the Lord's despise few let me tell you what it is it is greater riches it is greater riches than this than this world worldly Egypt Treasures that we could ever get the trials in our lives is worth more to us than all the money that this world could offer you know why because our money is going to perish it's going to burn it's going to burn up it's nothing but wood hay and stubble but the riches that we gain through through through the molding of character yes through the trials and tribulations of this life this little speck of dust of life like a little like a blade of grass that Springs up and dies away again greater riches your trials that's providing character it's proving you and is bringing forth character in your life is greater than anything that this world could offer wow [Music] wow what an Outlook what a way to look at things yeah that's the Bible's way of looking at things amen Moses made a decision to follow the lord his mom the church she did a really good job of telling him who he was where he came from and what his true identity was as a Hebrew until finally something happened in his heart when he seen a fellow Hebrew being smitten and being evily treated like brother uh Warren said the other week there's got to be a time of decision yes a time of decision when we choose God and God changes Our Lives that's right I feel sometimes that there's there's a big difference in a confession and a conversion right A lot of times if you if you put enough pressure on a person to make a confession and to make a good confession and it's a it's a nice confession it's a decision that they make and and it's a confession of I I want to live for God and I want to do what's right but unless that confession is molded into a conversion it's nothing but a confession brother bradam says I fear that we're not getting the people to Christ that's my desire not just for outward confession from our lips but a conversion of the heart of the Stony heart being taken away and God giving us a heart of new flesh not just a confession to make people happy not just a confession because you know that that's what some people want to hear but a conversion of the heart and soul or it doesn't matter where you are who you're with you're still a Christian it doesn't matter if other Christians are around you're still a Christian you still do what's right you still stand upon Integrity you don't tell lies you do the right thing why because it's not just a confession it's a conversion amen but when it's just a confession the life doesn't back it up when it's just a confession when that person's not around Believers they're no longer believers they believe what the other people say they believe what how the other people act they believe how everybody else dresses and so they act accordingly why because it's a confession God let us go past the confessions of our mouth down into the soul deep down within our hearts to a conversion when somebody is converted brother brandom says you don't got to Baby him amen he said you don't you they're not a a a hot bed plant or whatever it is he said you don't got to Baby him you don't you don't got to come here and spray pesticides on them and all that stuff no they don't need those things why because they've been converted they've been filled with the Holy Ghost so they don't need petted and babied and and encouraged all the time and and and told that they'll have a a position within the church no because they know who they are and there solid in who they are and they're sure in who they are because they've been converted yes Hallelujah so Moses made a decision that's important for us to make decisions every day in our lives we need to make the right decisions sir not just when we accepted Christ into our hearts but on a daily basis we need to wake up when then saying father help me to make the right decisions today in doing so you've already made the right decision because you started your morning with prayer Lord help me to do the right thing help me to make the right choices help me to do the right thing choices choices choices amen Exodus 2: 11 and 12 and it came to pass in those days of Moses was grown that he went onto his Brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his Brethren and he looked this way and that way notice because he knew what what he was going to do was wrong he had already made a choice in his life notice this he'd already made a choice his heart was already turning back towards his fellow people but watch what a confession or a decision does without a conversion and looked on their burdens and spied and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hit him in the sand because of a decision without a conversion right it did nothing but cause a dead stinking Egyptian in the sand the righteous indignation with Moses it rose up within him and what did he end up doing he ended up taking matters into his own hands thinking that because of all his training and all of his abilities and all of what he's been been trained to do by pharaoh and and he could teach this one and teach that one and brother Brenham says he was a a mighty military man perhaps he knew how to take over the country perhaps he had it already planned out in his mind I'm just I'm just imagining right now so you can imagine with me he had it all planned out in his mind this is how it's going to happen and I know that the soft spots within Egypt and and I know how we can crumble this place and and I know how I can do this because I have the military uh excellence and I have the no all and I have the ability and all these different things and he took things into his own hands he knew what he was being raised up for but yet when he took it into his own hands because of his own abilities it was all wrong he made the right choice to forsake Egypt but because he was depending on himself it was wrong in the eyes of God and they turned him down understand God doesn't need our abilities he doesn't need our money he doesn't need what what we think we can offer all God needs is a surrendered heart a surrendered life a surrendered mind and a heart of a servant that he may serve God's people and watch God use that person Mo uh Exodus 3: 3-5 it's our opening scripture and and Moses said I I will now turn aside and and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to seea God called onto him out of the midst of the Bush and said MO this Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from the for uh from off thy feet for the ground in which thou standest it's Holy Ground no notice Moses turned to the side Moses was going one way he was a Shepherd of the flock he was taking care of his father-in-law's sheep but there was an attraction over to the side here and the attraction that this this this bush that was on fire that was not being consumed it it it caught his attention and he wondered wow I better check this out I I better see and and try to understand why this is happening and when the when God got his attention now then God begins to speak to Moses but Moses turned aside you've made a decision what is God doing now Moses he made a decision and he brought him through 40 Years of of of of of the Wilderness brother bradam says of absolutely beating everything out of him of what he his own abilities and everything that he was and everything that he could accomplish by himself because if you notice when when you read the story of Moses Moses says uh I'm I'm a man I I I I can't talk how can I go down how can I do these things well I thought he was some great person God beat it all out of him am can you imagine being out just with the Sheep herd and the Sheep you'd end up probably not a very uh what's it called an outward person you're used to talking to the sheep and we all know that us as husbands we don't talk to our wives much either yep mhm you know a secret you know how to be a uh a real good husband guys you just say enough to continue the conversation that's wisdom until she catches on and she says something out of the blue and you're like yep no problem honey Stephen you weren't listening no I was not repeat it again please I got to come up with new tricks but we see here that now you all you're all like sister Ashlin needs prayer you know her that per girl her husband doesn't give her any attention and you know yep and you can all agree that your husbands are exactly the same way it's something we need to learn to do better at isn't it huh sure it is you know she gives me a hard time she says you talk to James more in the phone than you do with me I'm like no I don't I promise it's just when we're driving you know when I worked with Amos she was like I wouldn't answer her call and then i' call her back 30 minutes later you were on the phone with brother Amos again weren't you yep I'm sorry but we're talking about work anyways you know what I guess let me preach it myself here this is real good this can be God right here if anything else wasn't God this can be I think we as husbands me myself included we need to do so much better guys we are terrible at communicating with our wives we're terrible at it you know the other week I was preaching at brother Paul halit and the Lord the Lord really moved on me very very sweetly and I said when was the last time you told your wife you loved her when was the last time that you give her words of endearment and I hit a real Channel and it was really nice and um and I said brother Paul I'm sorry I know it's your pulpit and he said no I told you in the back say whatever you want and so that was good so we get into the car and I sit down and she looks at me and I know she didn't even say a word I said I love you baby I guess one thing that I'm learning is that women like to communicate they like to talk they just don't like to talk to their friends but they like to talk to us go figure what am I trying to say here I'm trying to say Brothers I'm right in line with you we need to step up our game am we need to spend some time with our sweetheart we need to take her out on a date once in a while we need to give her words of endearment you know why because that's what she needs she needs to be told that she's loved she needs to see the twinkle in your eye when you tell her that she's the most beautiful woman in the world that she's your sweetheart she's waited all day for us to come home just to sit down and have couch time and talk with us but yet we're too busy we're always thinking of the next thing we're always thinking of the next appointment we're always thinking of the next person we're always thinking about something else when she's sitting right there next to us and all she wants to some attention I'm going to put myself out there and say honey sorry for embarrassing you I'm going to try to do better can I have an amen with some brothers here all your wives are going to keep you accountable you're going to get into the car and she's going to be saying I'm waiting words of endearment of love and compassion it's what a woman needs and I'm learning that's what she needs and I'm learning the hard way but it doesn't matter because I'm still learning and that's all that matters just get off your phone man spend some time with that sweetheart yeah but you don't understand yeah you married her talking to myself right now too it's okay I'm having a conversation to myself with 500 people with the quickening of the Holy Spirit speaking to Hearts yes speaking to my heart saying Stephen you know what good is it what good is it if I preach and it does everybody else good what what what good is it if we're if if we do if we have a good Youth Camp and if we have all these different things but yet your wife is unhappy at home what does it what's the point it's pointless what's the point of you making everybody else happy in your life you make your boss happy you make your colleagues happy make your teacher happy by doing your school work you make everybody else happy but yet when it comes time for that sweetheart that you married we don't have time to make her happy amen I can leave it right there you know the Bible says uh lay the axe to the root of the tree man let the chips fall where they will chips are falling all over the place right now I'm blinded by the chips and I'm deafened by the silence amens of the sisters sisters say Amen give that husband to yours a [Music] nudge I receive it Lord hallelujah uh the voice of the sign 1964 brother brandham says God gives the signs to attract the attention of the people here The Burning Bush was Des signed to attract the Prophet The Burning Bush Moses was uh backside of the desert hurting his sheep an old sheep hurter 80 years old long beard going along down alongside of a a familiar old path one hot morning perhaps and then all at once there came a a bush on fire and that bush did not consumed well that was Al together unusual now Moses being a scientist which he was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians they were greater scientists than we have today so being a a scientist look and he said now I'll go to to I'll go see what kind of chemical is sprayed on those leaves that the tree doesn't burn see if he'd see if he'd approached it in a scientific way it would have never talked to him let me say this if you approach the sign of God in this day by intellectualism and having a carnal understanding of Creeds and things that you've been taught throughout the ears The Voice will never speak to you and you'll never hear the voice you've got to get past the sign in order to hear the voice but the approach to the sign is what is so important very good he said if he had approached it in a scientific way I would have never talked to him so it is today when we're trying to approach through school and education in a scientific way you'll miss God a million miles so if we approach it through school education a scientific way we're going to miss God a million miles approach it like Moses with his shoes offen humble humility wow you want to get somewhere with God and hear his voice we've got to approach him through humility we've got to approach him with our shoes off and humbly but if we approach it through pride and if we approach it through a carnal understanding and if you approach it through just repeating what a minister said one time you're never going to catch the voice for yourself and that's the most important thing my brother and my sister is not just to repeat what brother Steven or brother Ron or or any of these other ministers say no it's to catch the voice for yourself you see the sign you see the message but you also catch the voice behind it because it's the voice of God and that's the most important thing for this day as the musicians come footsteps are possession Moses shoes they were they were filthy I got to I was driving in my car and I asked the Lord and I said Lord why did you tell him to take off his shoes like why didn't you tell him to do something else and the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart just as I was driving I wasn't in a time of fasting I wasn't in a time of deep prayer I wasn't in a time of of of deep con con uh consecration in the word of God no I was driving my car and I asked the Lord this simple question why did you tell him to take off his shoes and the Lord spoke to my heart it was the Holy Spirit you know a lot of times we get so caught up with I have to do this and and I have to do that and and I and I need to fast and I pray and and do all these different things and and that's part of it it is but yet it's not our works that cause God to speak to us it's not because of our works or anything that we have done or our great ability to to spend hours in prayer at night with God that that makes us hear the word of God and understand it but it's our approach to him that when we approach him with Simplicity and humbleness of heart and we say Lord I honestly don't understand this I'm asking a question why I'm not being arrogant I'm just wondering and it was just so simple and the Holy Spirit speaks back to my heart says footsteps are possession Moses was on a path yes and it was the wrong path he had possessed many different places he had possessed many things and and and seen many things and been many places and probably did a lot of things that he should not have done his his feet were filthy and so he said I the Holy Spirit quickened to my heart said I was changing the direction of his life [Music] Wow his feet were filthy [Music] even though he had made a decision back in Egypt he had made a confession he made a decision I'm I'm going to forsake the treasures of Egypt I'm going to forsake these things I'm I'm going to be with my brethren I'm I I want to take my way with the Lord's desp his few it was a decision but he had never met God face to [Music] face he had never met the pillar of fire his life had never completely been changed he had never been sealed of God it was a confession it wasn't a conversion his feet was was dirty his feet were filthy but now God put this sign to attract his attention and Moses turned aside and he went after it and because he followed the voice of God and he took off his shoes and now he's standing in the presence of God Almighty now God can speak to him out of this fire and because his heart was right he had gotten rid of his pride he had gotten rid of his arrogance he had gotten rid of his his own abilities of how he thought things should have went now he was in the perfect place for God to use him understand when you make a decision for God things might not change right away it's a decision it's a step in the right direction but is it a conversion only your life will tell if it's a complete conversion or not but when you make that decision there's no turning back I've made a decision I'm going this way and I'm taking off my shoes because they're filthy and I want to come in to the pr presence of God Almighty when was the last time that you turned aside to see Jesus when was the last time that you were walking are you you put they talk so much now about having a block schedule and blocking things out and and making time for a certain person or a certain meeting and being here and they and they say I can tell you a lot lot about a man when I see his calendar I can see how how organized he is I can see if if he's got things in line I can see if he if he's a planner and a thinker ahead if if when I look at his calendar but I wonder how many times do we turn aside ourselves and we block out a time for God in our calendar well you say brother stepen I I already did it I I've been baptized by the Holy Ghost I I made a decision I've been converted praise God I I've been in this message for so many years and and my kids have been raised and and Hallelujah yeah yeah that's good but when was the last time that you turned aside and you took time for God when was the last time that you turned aside and you say father this time is for you it's not a time for anybody else it's not a time for any more meetings it's not a time for any worldly Affairs but it's a time for you and Moses turned aside I want you to put your name there and Stephen turned aside Thursday [Music] morning because the presence of God on Wednesday night caught his attention and he turned aside realizing that he needs to give more attention to his spouse he turned aside from doing whatever it is that he wants to do and he put a block on his schedule just for me and Steven turned aside and when he turned aside what did he see there was an attraction what is the attraction it's it's God but he's he's attracting me to something he's attracting us to a closer walk he's attracting us to his voice he's attracting us to his word put your name in there and so and so turned aside and so and so turned aside some of you haven't turned aside in a [Music] while so caught up with loud you see it so caught up with school getting good grades work family and the cares of Life came and it choked out the word that the word became unfruitful in their lives wasn't anything evil it was the cares of laa some of you have waited too long to turn aside but God has speaking to your heart this evening and and he's calling your name and he's saying tonight you need to turn aside you need to turn aside because I want to talk with you you need to turn aside because I want to have fellowship with you you need to turn aside because I have something greater for you I have a higher level to bring you to I have a higher consecration that you must give in your life it's time to turn aside it's time for us my brother and my sister to turn aside from the things of loudest here to say Lord I've been going this way and and I need to do these things but I'm I'm turning aside and and I'm putting my faith in you Lord I'm looking to the Cross I'm I'm I'm looking to the finished work you know that he is not a just a God who died upon a cross 2,000 years ago [Music] you know that he's alive you know that he showed himself to the disciples after he rose from the dead and when their eyes were opened they recognized him you know that he has shown himself over the past 2,000 years to a select people why does he do that because he's alive we don't serve a God that just died and rose again 20 th000 years ago but we serve a God who is right here right now we serve a god whose ear is not too heavy and his arm is not too short we serve a God who is on speed dial every time you get on your knees to talk to him a God who speaks a God who Woos a God who changes lives a God who changes situations when we let him into our lives to change them amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord we we thank you Lord for your mercy it endures forever you are not a god that is a god of just the past Lord and you are not a god of the future only but you are a God who is very present he is here he is a very present help in a time of need and and Lord you give me this thought of of turning aside and Moses turned aside and and Lord you know the struggle that I had 5:00 today and I'm still not done and I didn't know which way to turn Lord I but I had a thought of Moses turning aside and Lord I know that when you give me a thought that that thought is for somebody Lord perhaps it's for me also that I turned aside father may we turn aside from our own [Music] ways to serve you a living God because you're calling us Lord you're you're you're bringing us to the side that you might talk to us that you might love us that you might speak to us that you might show us things that you might show us that you care and and you're near and you're alive and and you're a good god father I pray this evening that all of us would purpose in our hearts Lord to turn aside and put a block on our schedule for Elohim because really Lord that's all that [Music] matters money comes and money goes work comes and work goes things come and things go but you're never never changing God and you're always there Lord so father help us that we purpose to turn aside and spend time with you Lord father God that we might know you in a more intimate way father we love you so much and we thank you for everything that you've done for us we thank you for the word and for the message of the hour for the truth Lord the light that shines upon our feet upon our path that we might see which
