[13:15] John Yarro yesterday and he said that he
[13:17] will be having back surgery this
[13:20] Wednesday morning at 7:30. He asked that
[13:22] we specifically remember him. So, let's
[13:24] pray for brother John Yarboro. you have
[13:26] a need this morning, you just want to
[13:27] lift that before the Lord, ask for the
[13:29] bar.
[13:34] Amen. So before we go to the Lord in
[13:37] prayer, I just want to greet you all in
[13:40] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[13:42] just want to thank you for your prayer
[13:44] while uh we're in
[13:47] Italy and it's really a great blessing.
[13:50] So I bring greetings from the pastor in
[13:53] Milan
[13:55] uh brother Ry Kabildo and also brother
[13:58] Joel Cabildo from Padoba and also uh
[14:03] brother Franu Lady Picard from
[14:06] Switzerland. So I bring you all
[14:08] greetings from them and
[14:12] u it's a great blessings to be there to
[14:16] minister the
[14:17] word of God to each and every one of
[14:20] them there
[14:22] and I got a text messages from brother
[14:27] Joel and
[14:29] [Music]
[14:31] he thank the Lord
[14:34] for visiting
[14:36] them. And he said that our
[14:40] little effort and give could not
[14:47] comprehend for what God has been given
[14:49] to them, the ministering of the word of
[14:52] God. Amen. And I know it's not only a
[14:56] one-man ministry, but it's a body
[14:58] ministry. Because the prophet said if
[15:00] you cannot go to a certain country in a
[15:03] missionary field then go somebody send
[15:06] somebody and support it. So if the
[15:10] ministry is a blessing to them it is
[15:12] because of your prayer. Amen. So it's
[15:15] not my ministry it's a body ministry.
[15:17] Amen. So whatever God is doing out
[15:20] there, you are included in it. Because
[15:23] as we preach the word, we feel the
[15:26] anointing and it's not in our it's not
[15:30] our desire, but it's the effect of your
[15:34] prayer and thank you for remembering us
[15:36] while we were there. So let us bow our
[15:39] head in prayer. Heavenly Father, we are
[15:42] so gracious, Lord, and we're so thankful
[15:44] this morning
[15:46] that give us the opportunity to gather

[15:54] for the opportunity that we can worship
[15:57] you, Lord, in spirit and in truth. Lord,
[16:00] thank you for being mindful of our

[16:15] once again will come down and minister
[16:17] to our needs,
[16:19] Lord. You saw our needs,
[16:22] Lord. And we believe that you're the
[16:25] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[16:27] Lord, you are able to perform what you
[16:29] promised in your word, Lord. And we rely

[18:05] You may be seated this morning. Want to
[18:07] welcome each one to the house of the
[18:09] Lord. Visitors here this morning, so we
[18:11] just want to be sure to welcome each
[18:13] one. Can't believe we're almost at the
[18:15] end of the month of
[18:16] May. Summer is almost here. Today is the
[18:19] last Sunday school
[18:21] session for the summer and so we'll
[18:24] resume again in September. So, no more
[18:27] Sunday school for the summer. And then
[18:29] just a quick announcement for the
[18:30] parents. Last few years we've had
[18:32] vacation Bible school. Had a lot going
[18:34] on this year so far. We had the play
[18:36] last week and got camp coming up this
[18:38] next week. And so we're going to take a
[18:40] break on vacation Bible school. We know
[18:41] vacation Bible school this summer, Lord
[18:43] willing, when we pick that up again next
[18:45] year. Brother Steven wanted me to
[18:48] announce that there are 35 bus spots
[18:51] available for the ride up to camp. So be
[18:54] first come, first serve. So I guess you
[18:56] can contact Brother Steve or more
[18:58] information regarding that. If you have
[19:01] bags to go up to camp, I assume if
[19:04] you're riding on the bus, bring those
[19:06] here to church Wednesday at 6:45 so they
[19:09] can sure get those loaded up on the bus.
[19:11] And then brother Steven Coffee will be
[19:12] ministering for us here this Wednesday
[19:14] night. So looking forward to that. Amen.
[19:17] God is good. Amen. There's going to be a
[19:20] meeting in the air and sweet, sweet by
[19:22] and by. For loved ones passing on, we
[19:25] have a promise of a resurrection and a
[19:27] meeting. Looking forward to that
[19:32] time. You have heard of little

[59:51] would open my eyes to the truth of what
[59:55] he's done in this hour to be able to see
[59:58] to have the eyes have of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:03] to not only see the signs
[1:00:06] because it was not the sign that made me
[1:00:08] a believer. Amen. It was the voice
[1:00:11] behind the sign. There was something.
[1:00:14] There was a deep calling to the deep.
[1:00:18] And there was a deep in here to be able
[1:00:20] to respond.
[1:00:22] That's what the calling of God is. It's
[1:00:25] a quickening power that pulls you.

[1:00:50] songs and
[1:00:52] today this is Memorial Weekend, right?
[1:00:56] Yes.
[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:01:00] Let's just thank God for all those who

[1:01:06] wars and gave the ultimate price.

[1:01:19] spiritual battles? Amen. And have gone
[1:01:22] on before. Yes. Let this be a great
[1:01:26] memorial
[1:01:27] day that we think of those that have
[1:01:30] gone on before us and we thank God and
[1:01:33] we say, "Lord, thank
[1:01:35] you." And we believe because the
[1:01:39] disciples said, "What can we do to work
[1:01:42] the works of
[1:01:44] God?" He said, "Only believe." That's
[1:01:48] right.
[1:01:51] Only believe.
[1:01:56] Oh, only believe
[1:02:02] for all things are
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:08] possible.

[1:02:23] only
[1:02:25] [Music]

[1:02:32] [Music]
[1:02:34] possible
[1:02:36] [Music]
[1:02:39] only. Let's just bow our
[1:02:41] heads. If you have a special request,
[1:02:46] something on your heart, maybe you
[1:02:48] didn't get to write it down and that you
[1:02:50] have a need and you say, "Remember me,
[1:02:52] Father." I think there should be hands
[1:02:54] all over the
[1:02:55] building, spoken,
[1:02:57] unspoken, thanks upon your heart,
[1:03:00] heavenly father, as we raise our hands
[1:03:02] to
[1:03:04] you, we ask you, Father, let faith rise.
[1:03:08] Let there be a moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:11] upon our hearts and open our eyes of
[1:03:14] understanding. Father, let there be a
[1:03:17] quickening power of the Holy Ghost come
[1:03:20] down upon that elect seed to give us
[1:03:23] understanding because that's the
[1:03:25] quickening power to transform us. We're
[1:03:29] being
[1:03:30] transformed from mortality to
[1:03:34] immortality. I thank you, Father. I pray
[1:03:36] now as I lay my hands upon this word, I
[1:03:41] ask God, may there come a supernatural
[1:03:44] anointing,
[1:03:46] you that inspired this word, that had
[1:03:49] men of old to write it.
[1:03:52] [Music]
[1:03:54] May that same inspiration come upon
[1:03:57] us that we might have ears to hear and
[1:04:00] eyes to see what you're doing in this
[1:04:02] hour. We thank you. We praise you. We
[1:04:05] commit every
[1:04:07] request, everyone that is here today, we
[1:04:11] ask that you will bless them abundantly.
[1:04:15] In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:04:20] Amen. Amen.
[1:04:23] Amen. All things
[1:04:27] are possible. That's right.
[1:04:31] Just believe. Amen. Let's just remain
[1:04:34] standing if you would. Thank you
[1:04:36] musicians each and everyone. Song
[1:04:38] specials were tremendous. Amen. I love
[1:04:42] that. Just love to see our people sing
[1:04:45] and worship God. God dwells in the
[1:04:48] praises of his people.
[1:04:51] Amen. It's good to have brother Mario
[1:04:53] and sister Josephine back. Amen. Amen. I
[1:04:56] always miss him when when they're not
[1:04:58] here and I look over in the corner and
[1:05:00] they're the seats are empty and and
[1:05:02] everything. But uh the Lord blessed
[1:05:04] brother Mario to bless the people over
[1:05:06] there in Italy. Yes. And uh just to
[1:05:10] encourage him and a lot of them are
[1:05:12] Filipinos and so he could even speak in
[1:05:15] Phil in his language there and bless
[1:05:18] them and then switch over to English and
[1:05:20] everything and make it even that much
[1:05:22] more understood. Amen. That's kind of
[1:05:24] like what God does during the
[1:05:26] ministering of the word. What he does
[1:05:28] because this message is coded. That's
[1:05:30] right. Amen.
[1:05:36] It is an encrypted message.
[1:05:39] And only those who have the ability to
[1:05:42] hear what the spirit is saying will
[1:05:45] catch it. Rest of them, it goes right
[1:05:48] over their head. They hear or they
[1:05:50] listen but they don't hear what the
[1:05:52] spirit is saying. God help us today to
[1:05:57] hear what the spirit is saying. All
[1:05:59] right, let's just remain standing. Turn
[1:06:01] with me to the book of Numbers. Book of
[1:06:04] Numbers. Amen. How many believe God is
[1:06:07] in numbers? Amen.
[1:06:11] Amen. Amen. Numbers chapter
[1:06:15] 14 verses 1- 11. And then we'll go a
[1:06:19] little further down there in numbers. So
[1:06:21] just keep your Bibles open. We're going
[1:06:23] to do a little bit of reading the Lord.
[1:06:27] And uh so Numbers chapter 14.
[1:06:32] And verse one, and all the congregation
[1:06:34] lifted their voice and cried, and the
[1:06:38] people wept that night, and all the
[1:06:40] children of Israel murmured against
[1:06:43] Moses and against Aaron. And the whole
[1:06:46] congregation said unto them, Would God
[1:06:50] that we had died in the land of Egypt?
[1:06:53] Or would God we had died in this
[1:06:55] wilderness?
[1:06:57] And wherefore hath the Lord brought us
[1:07:00] into the land to fall by the sword that
[1:07:04] our wives and our children should be a
[1:07:07] prey. Were it not better for us to
[1:07:11] return into
[1:07:14] Egypt? God does not want you looking
[1:07:17] back. That's right.
[1:07:20] The movement of God is forward.
[1:07:23] Amen. And the final movement of God is
[1:07:26] upward.
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:30] So here in this Exodus, no matter how
[1:07:34] vindicated of God, no matter how many
[1:07:37] signs and
[1:07:39] wonders, there's always somebody
[1:07:42] somewhere that's not catching what God
[1:07:44] is doing. And therefore they get a
[1:07:47] little disillusioned and say would to
[1:07:49] God that we would have
[1:07:51] stayed in denomination
[1:07:54] that they become a little disillusioned.
[1:07:56] I thought
[1:07:58] this is the message of the hour. I
[1:08:00] thought everything would be okay. Didn't
[1:08:03] think I'd have any battles, no demons to
[1:08:06] fight. It'd just be a rosy uh uh pathway
[1:08:10] and everything would be okay. No, we
[1:08:12] didn't enter into a picnic. We entered
[1:08:15] into a battle. You need to know you're
[1:08:18] going to fight for it. That's right.
[1:08:26] Verse four. And they said one to
[1:08:29] another, "Let us make a captain and let
[1:08:31] us return into Egypt." So now they're
[1:08:34] quitting the the leadership of God
[1:08:39] and they're taking and choosing
[1:08:42] man's leadership over God's. That's
[1:08:44] right. And they want to return into
[1:08:46] Egypt.
[1:08:48] Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces
[1:08:51] before all the assembly of the
[1:08:53] congregation of the children of Israel.
[1:08:56] And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the
[1:09:01] son of
[1:09:02] Jeffuna, which were of them that
[1:09:05] searched the
[1:09:07] land, rent their clothes.
[1:09:11] Here is two out of 12.
[1:09:14] that search the
[1:09:16] land and they hear what the assembly is
[1:09:20] saying and they rent their
[1:09:23] clothes. They're in such a time of
[1:09:30] grievance. They rent their
[1:09:40] clothes. Verse seven. And they spake
[1:09:42] unto all the company of the children of
[1:09:44] Israel, saying, The land which we pass
[1:09:48] through to search it, it is an
[1:09:51] exceeding good land. Yes.
[1:09:55] And if the Lord delighted in
[1:09:58] us, then he will bring us into this land
[1:10:01] and give it to us a land that is flowing
[1:10:05] with milk and honey. Amen. Only rebel
[1:10:09] not against the
[1:10:11] Lord, neither. Fear ye the people of the
[1:10:15] land, for they are bred for us. Their
[1:10:18] defense is departed from them, and the
[1:10:21] Lord is with us. Fear them not.
[1:10:26] But all the congregation bade them
[1:10:29] stone bade them stone them with stones.
[1:10:32] Do you see? Do do you think their sermon
[1:10:35] changed their minds? No.
[1:10:39] Their opinion is it ain't what we
[1:10:41] thought it was. Yeah. Yeah. Very good.
[1:10:45] Stone them with stones. Here's
[1:10:48] God's anointed ones to lead the people.
[1:10:52] And what they do when they hear this,
[1:10:55] they make intercession. Amen.
[1:11:03] And the glory of the Lord appeared in
[1:11:05] the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:11:07] before all the children of Israel. And
[1:11:11] the Lord said unto
[1:11:13] Moses, "How long will this people
[1:11:16] provoke me?
[1:11:20] And how long will it be error they
[1:11:22] believe
[1:11:23] me for all the
[1:11:27] signs which I have showed
[1:11:30] them. Heavenly Father, as we have read
[1:11:33] your
[1:11:35] word, we look back to see what
[1:11:38] was so that we will know what will be.
[1:11:44] same
[1:11:45] spirits, same
[1:11:47] times, and yet such great glory that we
[1:11:51] are about to see. I believe we've
[1:11:53] entered into the, as your prophet
[1:11:56] called, the finished cycle. Amen. To the
[1:12:00] end of all
[1:12:01] things. We're seeing everyone and
[1:12:04] everything take its position.
[1:12:07] Whether it be in the world or in the
[1:12:11] word, everyone is being
[1:12:15] positioned. Father, come and speak to us
[1:12:18] and anoint our eyes with the eyes have
[1:12:21] of
[1:12:22] understanding. I pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:12:24] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can
[1:12:27] all be seated this morning in the
[1:12:30] presence of God. Keep in your Bibles
[1:12:32] Numbers 14 verse 22.
[1:12:38] through
[1:12:41] 20
[1:12:46] 4. Numbers chapter 14 verse 22. Because
[1:12:50] all those men which have seen my glory
[1:12:52] and my
[1:12:54] miracles, which I did in Egypt, and in
[1:12:57] the
[1:12:58] wilderness, and have tempted me now
[1:13:01] these 10
[1:13:03] times, and have not hearkened to my
[1:13:08] voice, surely they shall not see the
[1:13:11] land which I swear unto their
[1:13:14] fathers, neither shall any of them, but
[1:13:17] provoke me see
[1:13:19] did, but my servant
[1:13:22] Caleb, because he had another spirit
[1:13:26] with him. I want you to know that Joshua
[1:13:29] and Caleb, the Bible says, was of
[1:13:31] another spirit.
[1:13:34] Hallelujah. The bride is of another
[1:13:36] spirit, and hath followed me fully.
[1:13:41] Him will I bring into the land where
[1:13:43] unto we he went, and his seed shall
[1:13:47] possess it. Verse 28. Now verse 28, say
[1:13:52] unto them, as truly as I live, sayaith
[1:13:55] the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine
[1:13:58] ears, so will I do to you. Your
[1:14:02] carcasses shall fall in this
[1:14:04] wilderness. And all that were numbered
[1:14:06] of you according to your whole number,
[1:14:10] from 20 years old and upward, which you
[1:14:13] have murmured against me.
[1:14:16] Doubtless ye shall not come into the
[1:14:18] land concerning which I swear to make to
[1:14:21] make you dwell therein, save Caleb, the
[1:14:26] son of Jeffuna, and Joshua the son of
[1:14:32] Nun. But your little ones which you said
[1:14:35] should be a
[1:14:36] prey, them will I bring in, and they
[1:14:39] shall know the land which ye have
[1:14:42] despised.
[1:14:45] But as far as you your carcasses, they
[1:14:47] shall fall in the
[1:14:50] wilderness. My
[1:14:52] may God
[1:14:53] add, let me see here. No, I want to keep
[1:14:56] reading. I want to go to because I feel
[1:14:59] this is very
[1:15:01] important. Let's go to verse all the
[1:15:03] way. We'll read continuing to verse
[1:15:07] 45. Verse 33. and your children shall
[1:15:10] wander in the wilderness 40
[1:15:13] years and bear your whoredoms until your
[1:15:16] carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.
[1:15:20] After the number of days in which you
[1:15:22] search the land, even 40 days each day
[1:15:24] for a year shall you bear your
[1:15:27] iniquities, even 40 years. And you shall
[1:15:30] know my breach of
[1:15:33] promise. I the Lord have said, I will
[1:15:36] surely do it unto all this evil
[1:15:39] congregation that are gathered together
[1:15:41] against me in this wilderness. They
[1:15:44] shall be consumed, and there they shall
[1:15:46] die. And the men which Moses sent to
[1:15:50] search the land who
[1:15:52] returned and made all the congregation
[1:15:54] to murmur against
[1:15:56] him, bring them upon a slander upon the
[1:16:00] by bringing a slander upon the land.
[1:16:03] Even those men that did bring up the
[1:16:04] evil report upon the land died by the
[1:16:09] plague before the
[1:16:11] Lord. But Joshua the son of Nun,
[1:16:15] and Caleb the son of Jeffuna,
[1:16:18] which were men that went into search of
[1:16:20] the
[1:16:21] land, lived still. Amen. And Moses told
[1:16:26] these
[1:16:27] things these sayings unto all the
[1:16:30] children of Israel. And the people
[1:16:33] mourned greatly. And they rose up early
[1:16:36] in the morning and g them up unto the
[1:16:38] top of the mountain, saying, "Lo, we be
[1:16:42] here, and we will go up under the place
[1:16:44] which the Lord hath promised, for we
[1:16:47] have
[1:16:48] sinned." And Moses said, "Wherefore now
[1:16:51] do you transgress the commandment of the
[1:16:54] Lord, but it shall not prosper?
[1:16:57] Go not up, for the Lord is not among
[1:17:01] you, that you be not smitten before your
[1:17:05] enemies. For the Amalocites and the
[1:17:08] Canaanites are there before you, and you
[1:17:10] shall fall by the sword, because you are
[1:17:14] turned away from the Lord. Therefore,
[1:17:17] the Lord will not be with you."
[1:17:20] But they presumed to go up unto the
[1:17:22] hilltop, and nevertheless the ark of the
[1:17:24] coven of the Lord and
[1:17:27] Moses departed not out of the
[1:17:30] camp. Then the Amalocites came down, and
[1:17:33] the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill,
[1:17:36] smoked them, and discomforted them, even
[1:17:42] unto Harma. May God bless the reading of
[1:17:46] his word this morning.
[1:17:52] I feel to
[1:17:54] take a sermon
[1:17:57] title of
[1:18:00] recognizing the change of administration
[1:18:03] at the end time. This is part
[1:18:07] four and I want to take a subject of the
[1:18:10] Joshua
[1:18:11] commission is commissioning the bride
[1:18:14] under the third pole.
[1:18:18] What is the third rule? The revealing of
[1:18:20] the word. It's the word in season. You
[1:18:25] have to understand understand there are
[1:18:28] appointed times and seasons, right?
[1:18:31] According to God, a time to be born, a
[1:18:33] time to die. Yes.
[1:18:37] A time to plant and a time to pluck up
[1:18:39] that which is
[1:18:41] spent. There is a time and a season for
[1:18:44] all things under heaven.
[1:18:48] Now, this past uh
[1:18:51] Sunday, I was talking about the pope
[1:18:54] coming out of
[1:18:56] America. And we know what the prophet
[1:18:58] said, how he said according to prophecy,
[1:19:01] there will be a pope coming out of
[1:19:04] America. And this
[1:19:08] sign was recognized by message
[1:19:13] believers both wise and foolish.
[1:19:18] Understand that
[1:19:20] those within the message both wise and
[1:19:23] foolish have said, "Oh, the prophet said
[1:19:29] 1954, watch that last pope. Watch that
[1:19:31] one when he comes
[1:19:33] out of
[1:19:36] America. And so it's come to pass. But I
[1:19:38] want you to know I have not heard of one
[1:19:41] skeptic, one scoffer of those who have
[1:19:45] claimed that brother Brandon made all
[1:19:47] these mistakes and different ones. And I
[1:19:49] have not heard of any of them changing
[1:19:51] their mind and coming back. Oh my.
[1:19:54] Right. Exactly. Because you know what?
[1:19:57] Signs don't make you a believer.
[1:20:02] Believers do not follow signs, but signs
[1:20:06] follow them that believe.
[1:20:09] Hallelujah.
[1:20:13] I remember the first time that the
[1:20:15] brethren that put together believed the
[1:20:17] sign.
[1:20:20] and asked me, they said, "Before we
[1:20:22] launch
[1:20:23] it and put it out on the internet, we
[1:20:27] want you to watch this and tell us of
[1:20:29] your
[1:20:31] opinion." So, they did. Voom, believe
[1:20:33] the sign, you know, all
[1:20:35] that. When they got
[1:20:38] done, they said, "Well, Brother Ron,
[1:20:40] what do you think?" And I said, "Excuse
[1:20:43] me, brethren, which one of those signs
[1:20:45] made you a believer?"
[1:20:48] Which one? Was it the halo picture? Was
[1:20:52] it the cloud? Was it the pillar of fire
[1:20:55] on his shoulder?
[1:20:57] Was it the amber light around brother
[1:21:00] Brandham there on the rock with his son
[1:21:02] Joseph? Which one of those
[1:21:05] signs made you a believer? Right? I
[1:21:09] says, "Because if you were to take
[1:21:11] away to me every
[1:21:15] sign, all of those pictures, all of
[1:21:18] those quote signs that people are
[1:21:20] supposed to become a believer."
[1:21:24] Because if you were to take them all
[1:21:26] away, I'd still be a believer.
[1:21:30] Because none of those quickened me at
[1:21:32] the moment and said, "Now I believe.
[1:21:35] I've seen the picture of the halo. I've
[1:21:37] seen the pillar of fire. I've seen the
[1:21:40] cloud.
[1:21:42] Many saw that.
[1:21:44] Didn't make them a believer. That's
[1:21:46] right. Just an attraction.
[1:21:48] It's just a sign. But there was
[1:21:51] something. There was a voice behind the
[1:21:53] sign. There was an attraction. And many
[1:21:56] saw the attraction. But there's only an
[1:21:59] elect few that are going to catch the
[1:22:01] meaning. Oh my. Some will just see it as
[1:22:04] a cloud and others will see it. It's
[1:22:07] him.
[1:22:09] But you have to look at it in the right
[1:22:11] direction. Amen.
[1:22:16] So the death of one
[1:22:18] pope and his administration brings a new
[1:22:22] pope and a new administration.
[1:22:28] And I want you to understand that even
[1:22:30] as we've got a newly elected president
[1:22:32] and he's been in office for a few days
[1:22:35] and there's been a change of
[1:22:37] administration, right? And we kind of
[1:22:39] think make America great again. They're
[1:22:43] admitting she was great and she's
[1:22:45] fallen. Right. Exactly. And then they
[1:22:48] make all of these inspections and these
[1:22:52] uh groups of people to go out doge or
[1:22:55] whatever you call them and go to looking
[1:22:58] at where is our money gone
[1:23:02] kind of like balancing the budget right
[1:23:05] and they're finding billions of dollars
[1:23:08] unaccounted for right
[1:23:11] and I want you to understand my brother
[1:23:14] and
[1:23:16] sister that America, no matter how much
[1:23:19] that we try to stop the spending through
[1:23:23] fraud and all of these things, she's
[1:23:26] hemorrhaged so much.
[1:23:28] Her monetary system has bled and bled
[1:23:32] until she can't even pay the interest of
[1:23:36] her debt. Brother Brandham said America
[1:23:40] will go bankrupt. Right. Right.
[1:23:43] He said the system I want all of you to
[1:23:46] understand that this system is working
[1:23:49] right together according to prophecy.
[1:24:00] There are so many prophetic events being
[1:24:02] fulfilled at this very moment.
[1:24:06] But one I want you to be totally aware
[1:24:09] of because there are some that say that
[1:24:12] the prophetic sign of the prophet of
[1:24:16] Revelations
[1:24:17] 10:7 is the last voice.
[1:24:21] I'm here to disagree with you. Right.
[1:24:24] The voice continues
[1:24:30] because according to
[1:24:32] scripture we find out those that take
[1:24:35] the open book and they eat it. The Bible
[1:24:39] says thou must prophesy. Brother
[1:24:41] Brennham said that John was a type of
[1:24:45] the bride of Christ. In fact, we see it
[1:24:48] throughout all of the prophet's message.
[1:24:52] He said the final voice to the final
[1:24:55] age. It goes from one prophet to a
[1:24:58] mystical body to a many membered body.
[1:25:01] Amen. And they under their messenger.
[1:25:05] Amen. Somebody say under their
[1:25:06] messenger.
[1:25:08] We don't get rid of that messenger.
[1:25:11] We're under that messenger. We're under
[1:25:13] that headship. We're under that token.
[1:25:16] Amen. But under their messenger, they
[1:25:20] will be the final voice. Don't deny it.
[1:25:25] Because if you deny it, you're denying
[1:25:28] the word. If you deny it, you're denying
[1:25:31] the prophet's message. Would the bride
[1:25:33] of Christ have a ministry before the
[1:25:36] rapture? Yeah, sure. Uh-huh. It's going
[1:25:39] on right now. It's Ephesians 4.
[1:25:43] He said that's God's dressear. Amen.
[1:25:46] Amen. How many believe that? Brother
[1:25:48] says it many places. That's God's
[1:25:52] dressear.
[1:25:54] All
[1:25:56] right. So, the bride, both wise and
[1:26:00] foolish, have been awakened by the shout
[1:26:03] of the midnight hour.
[1:26:06] We've come to understand the prophecy
[1:26:09] for this
[1:26:11] hour, what we call the
[1:26:13] message of the
[1:26:15] hour. And we've heard it and we're being
[1:26:19] quickened.
[1:26:21] I want all of you to know, you must have
[1:26:24] the quickening power of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:28] in your life to bring this off of the
[1:26:32] tape. Amen.
[1:26:35] to bring it out of the books.
[1:26:39] May I say this? Your letter without the
[1:26:43] quickening of the spirit is death.
[1:26:47] But when the spirit quickens this, it
[1:26:51] brings eternal life. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:01] So signs just get your
[1:27:05] attention. But it is God's quickening
[1:27:08] power of your understanding.
[1:27:11] Yes. of you catching it, of you being
[1:27:15] awakened or quickened
[1:27:18] to see what's going on, to know your day
[1:27:22] and its message. And when you know your
[1:27:25] day and its message, you've got to find
[1:27:27] out what position you play.
[1:27:32] Exactly. You have a part. That's right.
[1:27:35] Every one of you. like a great symphony.
[1:27:38] The prophet said, "So many
[1:27:41] musicians, so many different parts and
[1:27:45] some are have perhaps a a greater part
[1:27:49] than the little piccolo
[1:27:51] or the symbol or
[1:27:54] whatever, but each one of you must play
[1:27:58] your part." Yes.
[1:28:03] So everything is moving into
[1:28:06] position right now to play their
[1:28:11] part. And you say, "Well,
[1:28:15] uh, Brother Ron, with all of these
[1:28:18] signs, do you think the that's going to
[1:28:20] make the people believer?" No.
[1:28:23] In fact, I'll have you to
[1:28:26] know that there was a man that was over
[1:28:28] there across the chasm. Remember, he had
[1:28:30] died
[1:28:32] and he came to the he said to the Lord
[1:28:34] Jesus, I'll show you in Luke 16
[1:28:38] verses 27 through31. Then he said, "I
[1:28:42] pray thee, therefore, father, that thou
[1:28:45] would send him to my father's
[1:28:48] house, for I have five
[1:28:52] brethren, that he may testify unto them,
[1:28:55] lest they also come into this place of
[1:28:58] torment." Remember the man say, "Let me
[1:29:00] go back. I'll go back. I've got five
[1:29:02] brothers. Let me go back and tell them,
[1:29:04] don't you come where I'm at."
[1:29:07] Abraham saith unto him, they have Moses
[1:29:11] and the prophets.
[1:29:13] Let them hear them. And he said, "Nay,
[1:29:15] Father Abraham, but if one went unto
[1:29:18] them from the dead, they will repent."
[1:29:23] And he said, "If they hear not Moses,
[1:29:27] and the prophets, neither will they be
[1:29:29] persuaded,
[1:29:31] the one is raised from the dead." Amen.
[1:29:34] Amen.
[1:29:37] Amen.
[1:29:39] Thank God. Why are you here? Not because
[1:29:44] you saw all the signs.
[1:29:46] Not because you saw somebody raised from
[1:29:48] the dead. But I'll tell you what, all of
[1:29:50] you have been witnesses of those who
[1:29:53] have been quickened. Amen. From
[1:29:56] trespasses and death. You were born in
[1:29:59] sin, shaped in iniquity, come to this
[1:30:01] world, speaking lie. But because you
[1:30:04] were elect, because there was something
[1:30:06] inside of you, you had the ability to be
[1:30:09] reborn.
[1:30:11] He said in nonseed,
[1:30:13] there's nothing
[1:30:15] to quicken. That's right.
[1:30:18] They hear the same word.
[1:30:21] They can come under the anointing.
[1:30:24] They can feel the heat of the sun.
[1:30:29] They can feel the abundance of rain.
[1:30:33] But because there's no seed, there's
[1:30:36] nothing to quicken.
[1:30:38] That's why brother Bram said, "Oh, these
[1:30:40] people, oh, they feel such great
[1:30:42] anointings." Yeah. Well, the rain falls
[1:30:45] on the just and the unjust.
[1:30:49] Do not they both raise up and praise the
[1:30:51] Lord?
[1:30:55] Now the Bible says and go back now here
[1:30:58] to our talking
[1:31:02] about what is happening in this hour to
[1:31:05] understand the change of administration.
[1:31:08] Right? If you miss
[1:31:11] it, you're going to stay in a position
[1:31:15] without the isv of understanding of what
[1:31:18] God is doing because God is constant. He
[1:31:21] keeps moving. Very good. And if you fail
[1:31:25] to catch what God is doing in this hour,
[1:31:29] then you will fail to play your part
[1:31:33] because you're not coming into your
[1:31:34] position. Very good.
[1:31:38] Amen.
[1:31:40] So the Bible says in Deuteronomy
[1:31:43] 34:9 that Joshua, the son of Nun, was
[1:31:47] full of the spirit of wisdom.
[1:31:52] He was
[1:31:53] full of the spirit of wisdom,
[1:31:58] not just knowledge.
[1:32:00] So many people have knowledge. Eve
[1:32:03] lusted for knowledge but failed to get
[1:32:05] wisdom. Very
[1:32:11] good. This young man
[1:32:14] was one with perception.
[1:32:18] this young man Joshua. In fact, when you
[1:32:22] look in the Old Testament, you will find
[1:32:25] that Joshua whenever the battle, he's
[1:32:27] right in the middle of it. Amen.
[1:32:30] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. He's right
[1:32:33] there, right in the middle. In fact,
[1:32:36] he's the only one that ever made the sun
[1:32:41] stand still.
[1:32:44] Hallelujah.
[1:32:46] Never before
[1:32:49] had the sun stand still.
[1:32:54] In fact, I was I had a class at my
[1:32:58] university and we had a
[1:33:01] planetarium. This is before I came to
[1:33:03] the message and they said with the
[1:33:05] planetarium you can go ahead and you
[1:33:07] could process forward in time or back in
[1:33:11] time because the planets and everything
[1:33:14] all move according to a pattern.
[1:33:18] We can go back and we can see according
[1:33:20] to the time of the birth of Jesus, we
[1:33:23] can see stars lined up. And I'll never
[1:33:26] forget that my professor said, "But we
[1:33:29] have a glitch that we cannot explain."
[1:33:33] Wow. Hallelujah.
[1:33:37] They said there's something that is
[1:33:41] missing because when we tried to He It
[1:33:44] says there's just a few hours missing.
[1:33:48] What was it Joshua in the midst of the
[1:33:50] battle? Yeah. He said, "Oh, God, I need
[1:33:54] more time.
[1:33:56] Son,
[1:33:59] stand still."
[1:34:04] And the son stood
[1:34:07] still. Can you imagine such power with
[1:34:11] the spoken word? Amen.
[1:34:14] I want you to
[1:34:15] understand every time that the spoken
[1:34:18] word came to pass, whether it's in the
[1:34:21] prophet's life or throughout the lives
[1:34:23] of those in the Bible, it was the
[1:34:26] situation
[1:34:28] that caused God to come on the scene.
[1:34:31] And the believer was moved on by faith
[1:34:35] to speak the word.
[1:34:41] It is the situation
[1:34:44] Exactly. That makes him God.
[1:34:50] As Bethl and the sisters you
[1:34:52] saying, why do I trust him?
[1:34:56] Because I called. He answered. Amen.
[1:35:00] Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:35:05] Amen.
[1:35:07] I want all of you, let me just say this,
[1:35:09] that there is a power
[1:35:13] with inside of you
[1:35:16] that if you knew how to harness this,
[1:35:20] you could speak
[1:35:22] worlds into existence and you could go
[1:35:25] live on it.
[1:35:33] Joshua is the type of the real true
[1:35:34] believer.
[1:35:37] He is one that has got a different
[1:35:40] spirit because he is being led to go and
[1:35:45] put the people into their position.
[1:35:48] Moses told him and you this one will go
[1:35:50] here and there but it was Joshua.
[1:35:53] Joshua is Jehovah Savior. Amen.
[1:35:57] And so Joshua is under this
[1:35:59] anointing that says, "Though even the
[1:36:04] women in
[1:36:05] childbirth and under their birth
[1:36:09] pains, they would cry out where their
[1:36:12] child was to go." But it was Joshua who
[1:36:16] came and said, "You belong over here and
[1:36:18] you here."
[1:36:21] Amen. How we need the Joshua today, the
[1:36:24] great Holy Spirit. to lead us and guide
[1:36:27] us into all truth. Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:36:30] Amen.
[1:36:35] Joshua has the ability to read between
[1:36:37] the lines.
[1:36:40] He has the ability to
[1:36:44] perceive. He is able to
[1:36:47] see the picture within the picture. He
[1:36:50] has the ability to hear with his ear
[1:36:53] what the spirit is
[1:36:57] saying just as Boaz took notice of
[1:37:02] Ruth when she was working in the
[1:37:05] field. Now God's taken notice of the
[1:37:08] believer. Let's go back from the time of
[1:37:11] Boaz. How many know that just as that
[1:37:14] was a type, we're in another type?
[1:37:18] Because here we are at the time of
[1:37:20] harvest. And Naomi by
[1:37:23] inspiration, she told Ruth where to go
[1:37:26] and find him.
[1:37:29] Don't go to his home. He's not there.
[1:37:31] Where is he? He's at the threshing
[1:37:33] floor.
[1:37:36] He's there during and doing what he
[1:37:39] should do at the time of harvest.
[1:37:42] Hallelujah. Amen. Are you understanding?
[1:37:45] Where are you finding Boaz today? He's
[1:37:49] right here at the threshing floor. He's
[1:37:51] separating the shuck from the wheat.
[1:37:54] Why? Because the shuck is not air with
[1:37:56] the wheat. God is dividing. God is
[1:38:00] separating.
[1:38:01] The winds of doctrine are blowing and
[1:38:04] people are going here and there. But
[1:38:06] that seed, no matter how much the wind
[1:38:09] blows,
[1:38:11] because they have weight, you throw it
[1:38:13] up. Amen.
[1:38:17] Because it has weight, it has seed. It
[1:38:19] comes back down.
[1:38:21] The threshing only gets rid of that
[1:38:24] which is not seed. Right.
[1:38:34] Joshua does not come
[1:38:36] into his commission until after the
[1:38:39] death of Moses.
[1:38:43] God come and spoke to
[1:38:46] him.
[1:38:49] Moses, my servant is
[1:38:54] dead. Oh God, what about the message?
[1:38:57] What about the
[1:38:59] messenger? Oh, what's going to happen?
[1:39:03] Listen, God knows exactly what's going
[1:39:06] on. That's right. God didn't get
[1:39:08] blindsided by this. It didn't happen.
[1:39:10] And then he say, "Oh, wait. Stop. Stop.
[1:39:16] H Something's wrong." Because you know
[1:39:19] what? Moses was supposed to lead us into
[1:39:21] the promised land.
[1:39:23] But remember, because he lifted up
[1:39:26] himself.
[1:39:27] I wonder how many people that start out
[1:39:30] and God goes to blessing their ministry
[1:39:33] or their
[1:39:35] life and you get a little bit arrogant
[1:39:38] and think that it's all about you. It's
[1:39:40] not. It's about him.
[1:39:43] How do you know the seed is ripe unto
[1:39:46] harvest?
[1:39:52] Help us, Lord. Joseph
[1:39:54] had a vision. He was a spiritual man.
[1:39:59] And he told his brethren who were
[1:40:01] immature,
[1:40:03] carnal. Yeah. And he gave them a vision.
[1:40:07] And I see you shall all do oblation to
[1:40:11] me and you shall bow your heads.
[1:40:14] Who are you to rule over us? You're a
[1:40:19] Nazi boy.
[1:40:21] And so because they didn't understand
[1:40:24] and
[1:40:28] Joseph, he gets betrayed. Yeah. Sold.
[1:40:33] Yeah.
[1:40:35] Put into slavery. Yes. They take his
[1:40:39] coat of many colors and they dip it in
[1:40:42] an animal blood. Give it to their
[1:40:44] father. Your son, your beloved son
[1:40:48] is gone.
[1:40:54] I want you to understand Joseph, he's
[1:40:56] got this
[1:40:57] vision and it's held before him all
[1:41:00] those years.
[1:41:03] And yet once in a
[1:41:05] while perhaps in the pit he said, "But
[1:41:08] God,
[1:41:13] right,
[1:41:15] this doesn't match that."
[1:41:19] Then he gets put into slavery.
[1:41:23] But God, this doesn't match that. Yeah.
[1:41:28] Come on. Then he goes into Piper's
[1:41:31] house. You know the story. I'm not going
[1:41:32] to go into it.
[1:41:35] But
[1:41:37] this doesn't match that.
[1:41:40] I want all of you to understand
[1:41:44] this may not match that.
[1:41:47] for a season,
[1:41:49] but you let God have his way. God is
[1:41:52] bound and determined to bring you to
[1:41:54] your destination. And it wasn't until
[1:41:57] Joseph, hallelujah, came into his
[1:42:00] position. And he said when he he says,
[1:42:03] "Cast all the men out. I want to speak
[1:42:06] to them alone." And there he spake in
[1:42:09] the Hebrew tongue.
[1:42:12] He said, "I am Joseph.
[1:42:18] Joseph. And they were in fear of his
[1:42:21] lives. And he and he says, "I'm not here
[1:42:23] to avenge you. What you did
[1:42:28] was for a purpose." Amen. God sent me
[1:42:31] before you.
[1:42:33] That I might prepare. There is a type of
[1:42:36] Christ. Amen.
[1:42:39] I go before you to prepare a place for
[1:42:41] you that where I am.
[1:42:44] There you might be also. Hallelujah. So
[1:42:47] many times
[1:42:50] your this doesn't match this down here.
[1:42:56] So hang on.
[1:42:59] It ain't over yet.
[1:43:04] Hallelujah.
[1:43:06] understand even as that that painting of
[1:43:09] of the
[1:43:10] chess and you've heard the story of of
[1:43:13] it shows and the thing says
[1:43:17] checkmate but there was a chess a
[1:43:19] professional chess
[1:43:22] player that looked at it and said no
[1:43:24] there's one more move
[1:43:28] he said the queen has got one more move
[1:43:33] hallelujah I want you to understand this
[1:43:36] queen. If he is the king of heaven,
[1:43:40] there must be a queen.
[1:43:43] There's one more move. Brother man said,
[1:43:46] "Sh, that's that third pull."
[1:43:50] Don't try to explain it. That's right.
[1:43:52] He says, "You know what? It's a
[1:43:53] mystery." And guess what? You're a part
[1:43:55] of that great mystery.
[1:43:58] Yeah. He says, "I'm connecting you with
[1:44:01] it."
[1:44:03] So when this
[1:44:06] looks like that,
[1:44:08] you're going to step into the vision.
[1:44:13] Amen.
[1:44:14] All right, I'm going a little bit slow.
[1:44:16] I'll have to try to hurry up here, but
[1:44:19] yet I don't want to be rushed. Amen.
[1:44:27] Joshua is called in the scripture Moses
[1:44:33] minister. And I want you to understand
[1:44:36] that
[1:44:37] after the death of Moses, there was a
[1:44:40] change of administration.
[1:44:43] Do you see that? Amen.
[1:44:45] Never does God have one go off the scene
[1:44:49] but what somebody else comes on the
[1:44:51] scene.
[1:44:58] Joshua was commissioned at that
[1:45:02] time to into his position.
[1:45:07] Now understand, brother Brandham was
[1:45:10] under tutors and
[1:45:12] governors until a time appointed of the
[1:45:15] father. Be spiritual with me now. And
[1:45:18] some of you are tired. I can see it.
[1:45:21] Pinch yourself. Stay with me for a
[1:45:23] moment. Yes.
[1:45:25] The prophet of God now, he's coming into
[1:45:29] something because he's been under tutors
[1:45:31] and governors.
[1:45:33] He's been under Baptist teachers and
[1:45:35] different ones and Pentecost and he's
[1:45:38] gone to Mishawaka and he's seen all the
[1:45:40] gifts of the spirit and he's just going
[1:45:42] on but
[1:45:44] now he wonders what does this vision
[1:45:47] mean there it's a blast that looks like
[1:45:49] I'm going to die. It's okay God if you
[1:45:52] want to take me off the scene that's
[1:45:58] okay. He's up in Sabino Canyon. Many of
[1:46:01] you have gone up to Sabino Canyon.
[1:46:04] You've taken the hike. You've gone way
[1:46:06] up there where brother Bram said, "I got
[1:46:08] away from everywhere." Where is Elijah's
[1:46:11] prayer closet?
[1:46:14] Wilderness.
[1:46:16] Whether it's a cave or a mountaintop,
[1:46:19] he gets away from people. He said, "My
[1:46:22] excuse to to uh get away from people is
[1:46:26] hunting."
[1:46:28] You know how many times that he went up
[1:46:30] there and took his Bible and he quit
[1:46:31] hunting and he just read his Bible and
[1:46:34] he prayed. He wasn't even hunting and
[1:46:36] the presence of God would get so strong.
[1:46:41] He'd be there and here comes a deer.
[1:46:46] And the deer keeps getting closer.
[1:46:50] Don't you know I could shoot you? He's
[1:46:53] talking to the deer. Deer just keeps
[1:46:54] coming closer.
[1:46:57] What does this signify? Right? Because
[1:47:00] there's coming a time
[1:47:03] when the lion
[1:47:05] shall lay down with the lamb. There'll
[1:47:08] be a
[1:47:10] time there's coming a millennial reign.
[1:47:13] Wow. Yes.
[1:47:16] I've always, you know, you go to the zoo
[1:47:18] and you see the big lion.
[1:47:21] You see the big
[1:47:22] bear. How I've wanted to give that guy a
[1:47:25] big bear hug, kind of wrestle with him,
[1:47:29] come up there and take that lion and
[1:47:31] fluff up his
[1:47:33] mane. I've I've wanted to just befriend
[1:47:37] them. Amen. You do. You better not do
[1:47:40] that right
[1:47:41] now. No, no, no, no. You wait. You wait.
[1:47:44] You You will be able to do it, but not
[1:47:46] right now. That's why these guys that
[1:47:48] say we're in the millennium right now.
[1:47:49] We're in the Yeah. Go to the zoo. I'll
[1:47:51] go with you.
[1:47:54] [Applause]
[1:48:00] Brother Brennham, now God, what what are
[1:48:02] you doing with my administration?
[1:48:08] I've What are you doing? Do I go back
[1:48:11] into world evangelism? What are you
[1:48:13] doing? Are you taking me off? He goes
[1:48:17] way up there and he says, "All of a
[1:48:19] sudden, I'm praying. What does this
[1:48:20] vision mean?"
[1:48:22] He says there something hit my hand.
[1:48:26] Yeah.
[1:48:30] This is not a story.
[1:48:33] It's a reality. What is God doing with
[1:48:36] his prophet? He's commissioning.
[1:48:40] The first and second pull were
[1:48:42] attracting pulls.
[1:48:44] The third pull is not an attracting
[1:48:46] pull. You know what it is? It's
[1:48:47] separating. That's right.
[1:48:52] Third poll is an offensive pole. Does
[1:48:55] this offend you?
[1:48:58] Where could we go?
[1:49:00] You understand? He's up there in Sabino
[1:49:04] Canyon. What does it
[1:49:05] mean? He's already told Billy, Paul,
[1:49:08] Billy, I don't I'm not coming home.
[1:49:12] Take care of mom and the kids.
[1:49:15] He's in such physical
[1:49:18] determin sword hits his hand. He said,
[1:49:20] "I've always been afraid of a knife or a
[1:49:23] sword, but he said it fit my hand
[1:49:26] perfectly." Amen.
[1:49:28] That sword is a representation of a
[1:49:31] commission.
[1:49:33] Very good. Of a ministry.
[1:49:36] Now the third pole, the revealed word
[1:49:39] has been placed in his hand. And he
[1:49:42] says, "Is this a king's sword?" He said,
[1:49:44] "No, it's
[1:49:46] the king."
[1:49:49] He
[1:49:50] said, "A real servant is knighted." I
[1:49:54] want you to know he was an he was kned.
[1:50:00] Sir William Mary and Brandon.
[1:50:06] the
[1:50:07] knights of the round
[1:50:10] table. He was kned.
[1:50:13] I'm going to change that a little bit.
[1:50:14] Wasn't a round table. It was a
[1:50:21] pyramid. And there, my brother and
[1:50:25] sister, he said, "It's not the end." Go
[1:50:28] listen to the tape.
[1:50:30] He says, "It's not the end of my
[1:50:32] ministry." Right.
[1:50:39] It's the fulfillment.
[1:50:43] It's the vindication. Wait a second.
[1:50:45] Wait. I thought the hundreds of
[1:50:48] thousands there in
[1:50:50] Africa in Durban.
[1:50:54] Okay. And the different places were
[1:50:56] hundreds of thousands. And all of these
[1:50:59] people coming. And how about all of the
[1:51:02] services wherein brother Brennan
[1:51:04] preaches dynamic services thousands of
[1:51:07] people and people coming to Christ.
[1:51:11] Wasn't that the
[1:51:14] vindication? No,
[1:51:18] he hasn't entered into his position yet.
[1:51:21] Why? He's being led. He doesn't know.
[1:51:24] But visions are coming to him. People
[1:51:27] are telling him things. Visions, dreams
[1:51:30] are coming. People are seeing him as a
[1:51:33] as a chief on a white horse and I'll
[1:51:37] ride this trail one more time.
[1:51:40] How many you know he said that's a
[1:51:42] promise, right? And even I've talked to
[1:51:45] some says, "Well, he'll ride the trail
[1:51:47] one more time." I I'll tell you, brother
[1:51:49] Brennham says it three ways. Go back and
[1:51:52] look at it.
[1:51:53] He says,
[1:51:56] "I will ride this trail one more time."
[1:51:59] Then he says, "We
[1:52:02] will ride this trail one more time."
[1:52:05] Then he says another time, "She
[1:52:08] will ride this trail one more time." I
[1:52:09] want to ask you, which one's right?
[1:52:12] All of them. All of the above. It's one
[1:52:14] of those answers.
[1:52:16] It's a you check, check, check. It's all
[1:52:20] three. Why?
[1:52:22] Because who's writing the trail?
[1:52:26] I want to ask you, who's the prophet of
[1:52:28] the hour?
[1:52:30] Brother Brennham said, "The messenger is
[1:52:32] only a voice."
[1:52:35] He's a star messenger sent. He says,
[1:52:37] "But I got nothing to do with this
[1:52:40] message except a voice." He said,
[1:52:43] "There's something behind me." He says,
[1:52:45] "I have a gift to get myself out of the
[1:52:48] way."
[1:52:49] And he says, "And when I get myself out
[1:52:51] of the way, he speaks." Amen.
[1:52:55] Hallelujah.
[1:52:58] You've seen in the
[1:53:00] movies that they took of the prophet of
[1:53:03] God and the people come up under
[1:53:07] discernment. Come closer.
[1:53:10] That won't hurt you. Now, now, Brother
[1:53:13] Brennham is setting an atmosphere.
[1:53:15] Watch. He said, "Don't nobody even move.
[1:53:20] I don't want to anybody getting up out
[1:53:22] of their seat right now. He's gentle
[1:53:24] like a duh.
[1:53:26] And how many of you know Brother Brandon
[1:53:28] preferred to have the organ versus the
[1:53:32] piano? Why the why the difference?
[1:53:36] Because the piano is a percussion
[1:53:39] instrument. Only
[1:53:42] believe ding ding ding only. Ding, ding,
[1:53:47] ding, ding. If you had a dove up
[1:53:50] here, it was sitting right here and you
[1:53:52] went to play in this and it saw, what
[1:53:54] would it do?
[1:53:57] It's gentle. It's me.
[1:54:00] Well, if you had the dove sitting right
[1:54:02] here and you began to play, only
[1:54:08] believe.
[1:54:10] Only believe. See, it's not a
[1:54:13] percussion. It holds the presence.
[1:54:16] He said, "Now I take every spirit
[1:54:20] in this building here under my control
[1:54:23] for the glory of God." My
[1:54:27] Don't nobody move.
[1:54:31] Excuse
[1:54:33] me. Let me talk to you for just a
[1:54:35] moment. That's what Jesus did with the
[1:54:38] woman at the well. Yes. Yes. Exactly.
[1:54:41] Just a moment.
[1:54:43] Oh, I see you're not from here.
[1:54:47] I see you live in a city. It's got water
[1:54:52] around it. This and this. Yes. Yes.
[1:54:57] Just a moment. I see something more.
[1:55:00] You're not here for yourself.
[1:55:05] Are those things true? Brother Ram
[1:55:08] shakes himself. That wasn't me. Amen.
[1:55:13] He said, "All I did was vacate my mind
[1:55:16] for a moment and the Holy Spirit took
[1:55:19] over." God speaking to his child. Amen.
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:31] How many times have you been in a
[1:55:33] service when the preacher is preaching?
[1:55:36] Yes. And all of a sudden you knew it was
[1:55:39] God. Amen. speaking to you. And yet that
[1:55:43] minister, God used his voice.
[1:55:48] He was speaking directly to you. You had
[1:55:50] a request. You had a certain thing on
[1:55:52] your heart and it was almost as though
[1:55:55] yes, he was looking
[1:55:58] into your back window or he had an
[1:56:01] opportunity to eaves drop on your
[1:56:04] conversation as you came to church.
[1:56:06] True.
[1:56:14] Brother Brennham now comes down off the
[1:56:18] the mountain and he's jumping from rock
[1:56:21] to rock. He's he's yelling me all the
[1:56:24] way down the valley. She can't hear
[1:56:26] him. Ma, ma, I'm not going to
[1:56:29] die. It's my ministry. It's the
[1:56:32] furtherance of my ministry. Amen. When
[1:56:34] he thought it was the end,
[1:56:37] it was the furtherance.
[1:56:40] Can you see
[1:56:42] the church age was ending?
[1:56:47] The church has put the word out.
[1:56:51] Christ on the outside knocking on the
[1:56:53] door trying to get back in. Right.
[1:56:59] But now he's entering
[1:57:01] into a
[1:57:03] ministry. And you look at it. I want to
[1:57:06] ask you, how long was the ministry of
[1:57:08] Jesus
[1:57:12] Christ from the time that he took the
[1:57:16] scroll? He said, "This day is this
[1:57:18] scripture fulfilled." He took the scroll
[1:57:20] and he found where it was
[1:57:23] written of him. Yes.
[1:57:27] Catch this.
[1:57:28] Now you too have got to go to the same
[1:57:32] scroll.
[1:57:36] Find your place
[1:57:39] where it was written of you.
[1:57:42] Behold, I send unto you. Somebody say,
[1:57:45] "That's me." That's me.
[1:57:48] I send Elijah.
[1:57:51] You want to know how Elijah preached?
[1:57:54] You want to know how he acted? Turn on
[1:57:56] the tape.
[1:58:00] Good evening, friends.
[1:58:04] Greet you in the lovely name of Jesus
[1:58:06] Christ.
[1:58:08] He didn't It wasn't all of
[1:58:12] this Hollywood show.
[1:58:17] It wasn't screaming and yelling all the
[1:58:19] time. Although there were times,
[1:58:22] but there were most of the
[1:58:25] times that he's
[1:58:27] just when you listen to the opening of
[1:58:29] the seals,
[1:58:31] my it's not all kinds of screaming and
[1:58:34] shouting. It's people listening,
[1:58:37] listening, trying to grasp
[1:58:40] what the revelation of the word was
[1:58:42] saying.
[1:58:46] So yet we have conditioned
[1:58:49] We have conditioned through ministry who
[1:58:53] want to work something up. What's the
[1:58:55] matter with you? Come on now. If you
[1:58:57] believe the word of God, somebody going
[1:58:59] to say, "Amen. Somebody going to move.
[1:59:01] If nobody moves, I'm going to move. If
[1:59:03] nobody jumps, I'm going to jump. I'm not
[1:59:06] going to let no devil take my place."
[1:59:07] And on like this. And pretty soon you
[1:59:10] get ready, you know. Oh yeah. Okay.
[1:59:12] We'll jump. Get up. How many of you
[1:59:13] believe and pretty soon you got like
[1:59:15] popcorn?
[1:59:17] True.
[1:59:18] people jumping up. Well, because the
[1:59:21] minister said,
[1:59:23] "Yeah, it's true."
[1:59:25] They asked, "Brother
[1:59:28] Brennham, don't you believe in jumping?"
[1:59:30] He said, "Yes, sir, I do." "Don't you
[1:59:32] believe in shouting?" "Yes, sir, I do."
[1:59:34] "Don't you believe in speak?" "Yes,
[1:59:36] sir." I do. I do. All these things, he
[1:59:38] said, "But I want to know
[1:59:40] where and what kind of life you live
[1:59:43] after you're done jumping and shouting."
[1:59:47] Amen. Because he said, "I'm afraid we
[1:59:49] get emotional and we get one another
[1:59:51] spirit." Yep. That's what he said.
[1:59:55] Amen. Instead of the Holy Spirit.
[1:59:59] Amen. That's good preaching. I've been
[2:00:02] in meetings where I
[2:00:04] saw such an anointing.
[2:00:09] Yeah. The ministers would take the
[2:00:11] microphone.
[2:00:14] I'm You don't need to make this live
[2:00:17] because it'd be too
[2:00:19] loud. Praise God.
[2:00:23] Hallelujah. This is the ceiling time. Be
[2:00:26] sealed of God. And the people fall over.
[2:00:32] They go over to this part of the there's
[2:00:35] probably 1,200 people.
[2:00:38] There's all kinds of anointing shouting
[2:00:41] and people hallelujah. to be sealed of
[2:00:44] God. And now another 150 people just
[2:00:49] fall over. I want to ask you on the day
[2:00:52] of Pentecost.
[2:00:54] What fell? What fell? Yeah.
[2:00:59] Did the believer fall?
[2:01:02] What fell?
[2:01:04] Holy Spirit.
[2:01:08] Then I want to ask you in the
[2:01:10] scripture when you see people fall under
[2:01:13] a spirit and are cast down,
[2:01:16] thrown into the water or into the fire
[2:01:19] or they're stripped naked,
[2:01:22] right? I command thee in the name of
[2:01:26] Jesus. Paul we know and Jesus we know
[2:01:29] who are you?
[2:01:31] Amen. Seven sons ofKeva
[2:01:34] Deliverance Ministries.
[2:01:40] Come on.
[2:01:42] Out here and casting all kinds of devils
[2:01:45] off of people. Oh, I believe in casting
[2:01:48] out devils, but more devils are cast out
[2:01:50] by the ministering of the word than the
[2:01:52] laying on of hands. Amen.
[2:01:57] He said, "I want to know where you live
[2:01:59] after you get done shouting."
[2:02:02] Amen. He said, "If you're not careful,
[2:02:04] you'll find yourself defeated,
[2:02:07] depressed. Come on." Well, I thought
[2:02:10] this was it. The minister told me, "You
[2:02:12] got it." Come on. Remember now when I
[2:02:16] went to a Pentecostal meeting and I I
[2:02:19] didn't know nothing and I want the Holy
[2:02:22] Ghost and that man who had long hair and
[2:02:25] a beard and he looked like
[2:02:27] Jesus and he said if you want the Holy
[2:02:30] Ghost come
[2:02:31] forward man I was the first one to hit
[2:02:33] the altar and I've told you before see
[2:02:36] my tie tie my
[2:02:40] tie he raised my hands
[2:02:44] Brother Mark, you know what he did? He
[2:02:46] took my hands. He raised them up. He
[2:02:47] said, "Praise God, brother. Just keep
[2:02:49] rejoicing. You got it. You got it. Come
[2:02:52] on. Just Just rejoice. You got it. Say,
[2:02:54] "You got it. I got it. I got it. I got
[2:02:57] it."
[2:03:02] I said, "Oh, God,
[2:03:06] I wanted it. I was sincere." Yeah.
[2:03:10] And you didn't give me the Holy Ghost.
[2:03:13] Come on. What happens when
[2:03:16] you get disillusioned? Yeah.
[2:03:20] And you didn't get Yeah. what you asked
[2:03:23] for and you get a little disappointed.
[2:03:26] Well, if God you're going to be like
[2:03:28] that,
[2:03:30] yeah, I ain't going to serve you. It was
[2:03:33] there I turned.
[2:03:36] I got seven times because the Bible says
[2:03:39] the house having been cleansed, right?
[2:03:41] Amen.
[2:03:44] The spirit cast out
[2:03:46] goes out into dry places and gets sick
[2:03:48] and others worse, right? Amen. And comes
[2:03:52] back. What happens? Enters back in
[2:03:54] because the house having not been
[2:03:56] filled.
[2:04:00] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:04:03] you believe? Well, Brother Ron, I
[2:04:05] believe the message of the hour, and
[2:04:08] I've been told that that's the Holy
[2:04:09] Ghost because you say amen to all the
[2:04:11] word of God and and and that's it. And
[2:04:14] and and and and
[2:04:18] but I want to ask you personally right
[2:04:20] now, answer the question to yourself,
[2:04:22] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:04:24] you believe?
[2:04:26] And the Bible has said, "Well, we didn't
[2:04:28] know there was any Holy Ghost." Well,
[2:04:29] how were you baptized?
[2:04:32] Well, praise God, man. And I tell you, I
[2:04:34] was baptized by John. Yeah. But John's
[2:04:37] baptism was only under repentance. Yeah.
[2:04:42] Cuz John said, "There's one coming after
[2:04:44] me whose baptism is far greater." Amen.
[2:04:48] He'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost in
[2:04:50] what? Fire. Amen. Not just under
[2:04:55] baptism, unto repentance. I repent. Oh
[2:04:58] God, forgive me. I'm No. Have you
[2:05:01] received
[2:05:03] Let me let me say this. God does not
[2:05:06] seal the box car until the contents are
[2:05:10] in order.
[2:05:12] Amen.
[2:05:14] Justification, sanctification.
[2:05:18] Come on. All the way.
[2:05:23] Oh my. Here we go. Oh my. It's 12:00.
[2:05:28] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:31] Amen. Hebrews chapter 4. Let me just go
[2:05:33] a little further. That's okay.
[2:05:37] Hebrews 4:1. Let us therefore fear
[2:05:41] lest a promise being left us of entering
[2:05:45] into his rest. Jesus said, I want you to
[2:05:49] enter into my Sabbath.
[2:05:52] What is his Sabbath? Holy Spirit. Amen.
[2:05:57] I'll give you rest. Not as the world
[2:06:00] gives. Amen.
[2:06:03] Lest any of you should some seem to come
[2:06:05] short of it. For unto us was the gospel
[2:06:08] preached
[2:06:10] as well as unto
[2:06:12] them. But the word preached did not
[2:06:16] profit them. They didn't get any gain.
[2:06:19] There was no quickening. They heard it.
[2:06:22] Amen. It didn't do them no good.
[2:06:28] Yes. Amen. Not being
[2:06:32] mixed with faith.
[2:06:35] I want to ask you, with all of this
[2:06:37] message that you've been
[2:06:38] hearing, have you mixed it with faith?
[2:06:43] Wow. Faith. What is faith? Revelation.
[2:06:51] No matter how much you hear the gospel
[2:06:53] being preached, no matter how many times
[2:06:56] you go to church, no matter how many
[2:06:58] tapes and books you read and
[2:07:01] listen until there is a quickening by
[2:07:04] the Holy
[2:07:05] Spirit, it's nothing. It's only
[2:07:09] knowledge. Now, there's that's okay. I
[2:07:11] want you
[2:07:13] to get that because it's putting it on
[2:07:15] your hard drive right now. You that are
[2:07:18] technicians and technical, I want you to
[2:07:21] understand if
[2:07:23] you query something on a
[2:07:27] computer and the computer cannot find it
[2:07:31] on the hard drive.
[2:07:36] Yeah. It comes up with an empty search.
[2:07:41] Ain't found.
[2:07:43] Not there.
[2:07:47] doesn't compute.
[2:07:52] I'm so thankful that we are able
[2:07:55] today because there's been so many
[2:07:57] different doctrinal directions preached
[2:08:00] to the bride, right?
[2:08:03] Okay. You got to believe it this way.
[2:08:05] You got to believe it that way. You got,
[2:08:07] you know, all of these isms that have
[2:08:10] been grafted in
[2:08:17] How can you
[2:08:18] tell what kind of a grafted in branch it
[2:08:22] is? You wait until the fruit. Amen. And
[2:08:26] the fruit will tell you of what seed it
[2:08:31] is of. Right
[2:08:34] now, brother Brennham says in the
[2:08:36] revelation of Jesus Christ, seven church
[2:08:38] age book, the importance of revelation
[2:08:40] by the spirit to a true believer can
[2:08:43] never be overemphasized. Amen.
[2:08:46] Revelation means more to you than
[2:08:48] perhaps.
[2:08:50] Wow. You realize, wow, I didn't realize
[2:08:54] that.
[2:08:55] You young people,
[2:08:59] you older people, let's take all of us
[2:09:03] with all of the hearing of the message
[2:09:05] and all of these tapes that have been
[2:09:07] played and all the quotes that have been
[2:09:08] given.
[2:09:12] I want to ask you, is it a revelation to
[2:09:14] you or has it become just a religion?
[2:09:20] a dress, long hair, preach, brother.
[2:09:23] Huh? Yeah. Have we become the Amish
[2:09:27] of the end time? Yeah. Well, we just go
[2:09:30] to church
[2:09:32] and we believe this and we believe that.
[2:09:35] Our religion
[2:09:40] says when we have reduced this message
[2:09:44] down to Yes. creeds and dogmas. Yeah.
[2:09:49] It's lost the life.
[2:09:57] Sister Gloria Barker sits
[2:10:00] here. Her husband wrote that song. It's
[2:10:03] the life behind the name that makes the
[2:10:08] demons tremble.
[2:10:11] Amen. There's no more life.
[2:10:16] It's the life behind the name
[2:10:20] that makes the proud heart humble
[2:10:27] life behind the name.
[2:10:32] I just
[2:10:33] feel kind of deeply moved.
[2:10:36] Uh I I feel God is is here.
[2:10:44] Yeah.
[2:10:46] Honestly, sometimes I feel like I can't
[2:10:50] preach good
[2:10:53] enough. I'm unable.
[2:10:57] I don't have the words
[2:11:00] adequate. I kind of feel like brother
[2:11:02] Brennham said, I'm uneducated
[2:11:08] and I'm so inadequate.
[2:11:11] And yet I know that if you'll just yield
[2:11:14] yourself Yes. Amen.
[2:11:17] That when he comes by,
[2:11:20] when he comes by,
[2:11:24] do you know when he comes by?
[2:11:27] When you ask him.
[2:11:34] When you ask him.
[2:11:40] When was the last time you said, "Stay
[2:11:42] with me, Lord.
[2:11:45] Stay with me the hours far spent.
[2:11:51] And the Bible says, "And he made as
[2:11:53] though he would go further."
[2:11:56] And they said, "No, stay with us here."
[2:11:59] Two on the road to Emmas, and they
[2:12:01] didn't recognize him. There he was, the
[2:12:05] resurrected Lord Jesus, walking with
[2:12:08] them.
[2:12:12] And he beginning in the book of
[2:12:15] Moses all the way to the present day, he
[2:12:19] began to take the scriptures concerning
[2:12:21] himself.
[2:12:24] And yet they didn't realize it was him.
[2:12:28] Stay with us here. musicians if you
[2:12:37] come there he is
[2:12:40] sitting said okay I'll stay with you
[2:12:42] because you asked me
[2:12:46] to so he sat at the
[2:12:50] table and he blessed the
[2:12:54] bread and he break
[2:12:56] it how long was his prayer
[2:13:01] pray. You think it was a 30 or 40
[2:13:04] minute orientation of what God's doing?
[2:13:08] Or was it
[2:13:11] Lord bless this bread I ask in your
[2:13:14] name? And when he when he took the bread
[2:13:18] and he break it, the bread he said, I am
[2:13:21] the bread of life
[2:13:23] which came down from heaven. Your
[2:13:25] fathers ate mana in the wilderness and
[2:13:29] everyone dead.
[2:13:32] Come
[2:13:33] eat. Take, eat. This is my body which is
[2:13:36] broken for you. This bread, take it and
[2:13:39] eat it in remembrance of me.
[2:13:44] Take this wine and drink it in
[2:13:46] remembrance of my blood. Thank you,
[2:13:49] Lord.
[2:13:50] That's why we take communion.
[2:13:54] And I will say this to all of you
[2:13:56] because all of you are here right now.
[2:13:59] Communion is an important service for
[2:14:01] you to take.
[2:14:03] When we have communion, all of you
[2:14:06] should be here.
[2:14:08] None of you. True. Should miss it. True.
[2:14:13] Why? It's your duty. Yes.
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:19] And you say, "Well, Brother
[2:14:21] Ron, uh, I'm not in the position." Well,
[2:14:24] you sit there and you don't come through
[2:14:27] the line. You judge yourself and say,
[2:14:29] "Okay." And you stay. So then everyone
[2:14:31] will know, well, you better pray for
[2:14:32] them because they didn't they didn't
[2:14:34] take communion. They didn't judge
[2:14:35] themselves. Yeah.
[2:14:39] [Music]
[2:14:43] And when he took the bread, he blessed,
[2:14:45] didn't
[2:14:46] he? And when he did, and he broke the
[2:14:48] bread of life.
[2:14:53] It's him.
[2:14:56] It's him.
[2:14:58] [Music]
[2:15:01] And all of a sudden,
[2:15:05] this manifestation
[2:15:07] of Christ once they saw who he
[2:15:10] was, he goes back into that unseen
[2:15:14] realm. Yeah.
[2:15:16] You understand? There are many times in
[2:15:19] your life you're praying, you're
[2:15:22] reading, you're doing
[2:15:25] something and all of a sudden you become
[2:15:28] acutely aware he's here
[2:15:31] and your heart is smitten
[2:15:34] and you just go, "Oh, God, just stay
[2:15:36] with me for a moment."
[2:15:39] Those moments, let me tell you, you're
[2:15:42] getting an upgrade. Yes. At that very
[2:15:45] moment, God is moving on your heart.
[2:15:48] He's breaking down that stony heart,
[2:15:51] taking away the calluses of sin, taking
[2:15:54] away the cares of life, and God breaking
[2:15:57] it down.
[2:15:59] And for a millisecond,
[2:16:02] you are jettisoned up into a place
[2:16:05] called heavenly places. Hallelujah. In
[2:16:08] Christ Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:16:14] But after he does
[2:16:17] that, it breaks right back into that
[2:16:20] realm of the unseen. Yeah.
[2:16:24] There'll be many times in your life.
[2:16:27] Yeah. God will reveal himself.
[2:16:31] It'll be so powerful. It'll be so
[2:16:33] quickly.
[2:16:35] Then all of a sudden, he pulls back.
[2:16:37] Where Where'd he go?
[2:16:39] Oh, if I could just live in that
[2:16:41] presence. Oh, if I could just stay
[2:16:44] there.
[2:16:46] One day you will. Amen. Lord, Enoch, are
[2:16:50] you listening? One day you will. You'll
[2:16:52] step into that vision. Why? Enoch, live
[2:16:55] by faith.
[2:16:57] And he was not for God. God took him.
[2:17:03] [Music]
[2:17:06] God calls for a total separation from
[2:17:12] unbelief. I've gone far enough this
[2:17:17] [Music]
[2:17:21] morning. God,
[2:17:23] [Music]
[2:17:24] move on.
[2:17:32] [Music]
[2:17:39] How many would like to have more of God
[2:17:42] in your life?
[2:17:45] [Music]
[2:17:49] If you want more of
[2:17:51] God, give him more of you.
[2:17:56] Make a sacrifice unto God. You are kings
[2:18:01] and priests unto God. Yes.
[2:18:05] Who are to make spiritual sacrifices
[2:18:09] [Music]
[2:18:13] here in God's house right now in his
[2:18:16] presence.
[2:18:23] Lord, just move on my heart. Amen.
[2:18:27] Forgive me of my carnality. Forgive me
[2:18:29] of
[2:18:31] my my humanness.
[2:18:37] I'm human.
[2:18:40] I tend to forget. Yes, I get caught up
[2:18:43] with work. I get caught up with my
[2:18:45] career. I get caught up with this and
[2:18:47] that and payments and what am I going to
[2:18:50] do? And he said, "Take no thought for
[2:18:52] tomorrow." Amen.
[2:18:55] He said, "Seek ye first." Yes. Amen.
[2:19:00] Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and
[2:19:05] all of these other things will be added
[2:19:07] unto you.
[2:19:09] Maybe you just been overburdened
[2:19:11] [Music]
[2:19:15] lately. You've been
[2:19:17] encumbered. Wasn't sin, right? No,
[2:19:20] you're not out
[2:19:22] there doing the things of the world, but
[2:19:24] the world is
[2:19:25] [Music]
[2:19:36] just the world is just creeping in on
[2:19:40] me.
[2:19:42] That which I want to do, I don't do.
[2:19:50] and I'm having a hard
[2:19:51] time. I need you, Father.
[2:19:55] You said that you would lead me and
[2:19:57] guide me into all truth. You said that
[2:20:00] if I would cast my cares on
[2:20:04] you, your yoke would be easy. Your
[2:20:07] burden would be light. Why am I so
[2:20:09] heavy? Right?
[2:20:12] It's because you know what? You haven't
[2:20:14] given him more of you lately.
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:20:21] That's all. It's real simple. He just
[2:20:25] wants more of you. He wants more of your
[2:20:27] prayer life. He wants more of your
[2:20:29] worship. He wants more of your
[2:20:33] Facebook, of your
[2:20:36] Instagram, of your
[2:20:39] texting, of all of your internet and all
[2:20:42] of this stuff. And you spend all of this
[2:20:44] time trying to impress others and
[2:20:47] showing them where you're going and what
[2:20:49] you're doing. Who cares?
[2:20:52] [Music]
[2:20:56] Who cares?
[2:20:59] I just want to please him. Amen. Amen.
[2:21:04] In
[2:21:06] moments like these,
[2:21:11] I sing
[2:21:13] out a
[2:21:16] song. I sing

[2:31:33] [Music]
[2:31:40] Wow.
[2:31:47] [Music]
[2:31:50] He's coming soon. Amen.
[2:31:56] The Pope and his
[2:32:00] administration is pulling all of the
[2:32:02] pieces together.
[2:32:05] Trump is trying to pull all of his
[2:32:08] pieces together. And you've noticed that
[2:32:12] he went over to the
[2:32:15] Arabs, Saudi
[2:32:18] [Music]
[2:32:20] Arabia. He's not a politician. He's a
[2:32:24] businessman. Now, if you want to read
[2:32:26] some very interesting quotes, go home,
[2:32:29] type in just the word Arabs.
[2:32:32] He said, "Watch when America goes over
[2:32:35] and makes friends with the
[2:32:37] Arabs." He said, "The next thing they'll
[2:32:39] do, they'll turn their back on Israel."
[2:32:42] Yeah.
[2:32:47] He said, "Watch, they go over and try to
[2:32:49] hold hands with the sons of Ishmael
[2:32:53] and they give them gifts and
[2:32:55] airplanes, all of this kind of stuff."
[2:32:59] And he says, "Watch, because now all
[2:33:01] these pieces are coming together." He
[2:33:04] said, "Look at this. When America starts
[2:33:06] going over there and they play their
[2:33:09] politics with the
[2:33:11] Arabs and here's
[2:33:14] Israel, did you forget Israel?
[2:33:18] Yeah. What about our support to Israel?
[2:33:21] One day we will." And he says, "When she
[2:33:24] turns her back, it's over then." That's
[2:33:26] it. They're getting ready over there.
[2:33:29] May the 7th,
[2:33:31] 1946, the same day that the angel of the
[2:33:35] Lord met brother Brennham in
[2:33:37] Greensmill and sent me out with this
[2:33:40] message. He said the same
[2:33:43] day that he says Israel became a nation,
[2:33:46] watch. It's all connected together. And
[2:33:49] when the Gentile
[2:33:51] dispensation is closing,
[2:33:54] there's another dispensation coming.
[2:33:56] It's to the Jews.
[2:33:59] And he says, "And when this bride goes
[2:34:02] up to two witnesses come down, and he
[2:34:06] says, "And then three and a half years."
[2:34:10] He said, "But the bride will be gone.
[2:34:13] She'll be in glory." Hallelujah.
[2:34:16] Hallelujah. Come quickly, Lord. Amen.
[2:34:19] They're over there. They're wanting to
[2:34:21] rebuild the
[2:34:23] temple. But guess what? The gentile
[2:34:26] bride, they know what temple, what house
[2:34:29] will you build me?
[2:34:34] That's right. This is the temple. Not
[2:34:37] made with hands. God's perfecting temple
[2:34:40] worship right now in the bride. Amen.
[2:34:44] She is catching the revelation. She's
[2:34:47] beginning to to understand. She's
[2:34:50] moving. Amen. This bride of Christ is
[2:34:52] being moved by the Holy Spirit, she's
[2:34:56] coming into her position. And the
[2:34:58] prophet said, when the true bride,
[2:35:01] begins to catch a true revelation of who
[2:35:03] she is. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:35:08] He said, watch this. Watch that third
[2:35:10] pull. Amen. Amen. He said, what you've
[2:35:13] seen manifested temporarily
[2:35:16] will come in the fullness
[2:35:19] of its power. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:35:23] Lord, we
[2:35:25] come to
[2:35:27] you in worship.
[2:35:31] No matter what. No matter what the
[2:35:34] circumstance.
[2:35:38] No matter
[2:35:40] what the
[2:35:46] situation, we will
[2:35:48] lift the
[2:35:51] holy hand.
[2:35:53] [Music]
[2:36:06] How we
[2:36:07] long to
[2:36:10] worship
[2:36:13] you and
[2:36:18] love
[2:36:21] him. How we long to
[2:36:25] worship you,
[2:36:29] Lord. We come to you in praise.
[2:36:32] to
[2:36:33] you in your grace.
[2:36:37] No matter
[2:36:39] what they have
[2:36:44] us, we know you'll set us
[2:36:52] free if we
[2:36:54] lift our
[2:36:56] hands and sing.
[2:37:07] Lord,
[2:37:11] hello. How we
[2:37:13] long to
[2:37:16] worship

[2:38:02] worship him.
[2:38:05] We fall down. We lay our crowns at the
[2:38:07] feet of Jesus. Amen. He's worthy of it
[2:38:10] all. We fall down.
[2:38:15] We fall down.
[2:38:18] We lay our crowns at the
[2:38:23] feet of
[2:38:26] [Music]
[2:38:27] Jesus. The greatness
[2:38:30] of his mercy and love at the

[2:39:10] fears. We cried our tears at the
[2:39:15] [Music]
[2:39:16] feet of
[2:39:20] Jesus. His grace
[2:39:23] abounds to all who
[2:39:27] found the

[2:49:44] Let's pray together. Heavenly Father,
[2:49:46] what an awesome privilege it was to be
[2:49:49] in your house, Lord, and to feel your
[2:49:51] presence, Father, to hear your word and
[2:49:53] to recognize the day and the hour in
[2:49:56] which we're living. Father, as we see
[2:49:58] all the pieces uh taking their position,
[2:50:02] Lord, we are also taking our position
[2:50:04] within the body. And I pray, Father,
[2:50:07] that you would give us courage to stand
[2:50:09] in this evil day, to stand in our
[2:50:11] position and to play our part, and to
[2:50:13] play it well. Father, this week as we
[2:50:16] have camp coming up, I ask for a a
[2:50:19] special time with the young people,
[2:50:21] Lord, even brother Steven Coffee and
[2:50:24] brother uh Matthew McGee. Lord, as as
[2:50:27] they as they set their face and their
[2:50:29] heart towards you this week, may you
[2:50:31] soften their spirits, Lord. Soften their
[2:50:34] hearts, Father. Give them a a word in
[2:50:36] due season, Lord, that that would prick
[2:50:39] the hearts of of every camper and young
[2:50:42] person that would attend our meetings.
[2:50:44] move in a special way. We pray, Father.
[2:50:46] And for our pastor this morning, thank
[2:50:48] you for him pouring out his heart to us.
[2:50:51] I ask that you would return strength and
[2:50:54] virtue to his body, Lord. Father God,
[2:50:57] we'll be sure to give you all the honor,
[2:50:59] the glory, and all the praise for it
[2:51:01] only belongs to thee. In Jesus name we
[2:51:04] pray. Amen. Amen.
