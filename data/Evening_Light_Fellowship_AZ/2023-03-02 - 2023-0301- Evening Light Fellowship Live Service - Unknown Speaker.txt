Rebecca in prayer she started her first chemo therapy session today you do it twice a week for uh six months and uh you know I've never been there and never seen that done where they sit down in the chair and you get a little Port that they put in your chest here and then they do that and everything but she was feeling good after the first session and everything and we went out and had a salad afterwards and and everything but uh she's real courageous and and she's uplifting in her spirit I'm believing God's gonna do great things and so listen God can use medicine I don't care if it's a miracle I don't care what happens I just believe that God is in control of all things amen amen and we have our brother Mike's going to be ministering for us tonight and brother Mike is one of the ones that ordained me into the ministry many years ago and brother Mike uh there in the Flagstaff church and I've heard him preach many many times he has a uh a true warrior for the Gospel of Jesus

for you Andrew glad this afternoon as you know that he cares for you above everything that man can bring together God can watch over you and direct our paths we bow our hearts just a moment if you would our heavenly father we thank you for this time together with our brothers and sisters me in our heart honestly Lord begin to consider he careth for me to such a place oh God that we find out our life becomes change because we believe in that which you are we thank you for this opportunity we ask the Lord that you would bless us do things for us here this evening Lord that we would desire it I ask it of you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen and amen amen God bless you you may be seated you want to say once again it's a pleasure to be here with you kind of a full-time preacher but I believe God cares for you and a lot of things I get sensitive on is that I don't know that a lot of things matters to us a whole lot about what does matter but you know there's something to matter in our life I want to see Christ I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I want to heal is sick I want to raise the Dead I want to see God alive in the lives of our people is that true amen and I think that we talk about these things and I believe that's why God set him in our hearts today to believe these things that God careth for us because when you begin to care God begins to care you don't care if things pass up that way but this evening we just ask the Lord to bless the word of God and and the things that are said if you need someone can I ask you a question how many of you have never been baptized anybody in here never been baptized one hand two three four I would suggest you got that taken care of as soon as you can now I'm serious I'm serious if Jesus is coming we best take it advantage and start getting ready amen and how many don't feel well tonight and you need a healing power there's one two well there's a few people like that and I raise my hand among those things also we serve a risen savior we send the world today and the thing of it is we're not here to entertain we're not here to do certain things but we're here to bring about in our life the power of the resurrected Jesus Christ Among Us he lives amen and if you believe it you know it's hard no doubt to get a church to be moved by such things we just sit there but I I want to address these things today because uh he lives I live amen he is my kinsman redeemer amen and that's the things that we want in our our lives and we're looking for a passage of scriptures if the player would play that song Or for our chapter today I'd appreciate it I believe it's in Hebrews if you would please I'm sorry I guess I missed my quota to them to ask them to put that that on he cares for you and what I wanted to play out of that I wanted Hebrews 7 verses 1 through 3 for this Melchizedek can you do that for me all right if you have your Bibles in turn with me if you would to Hebrews chapter 7. Hebrews chapter 7 and we would like to begin reading on the uh book that we have for us goodness I think it's the third verse 7-3 without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of day or end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth the priests forever continually as we look at these scriptures you may be seated Master God would bless them sorry we miss the but what touches my heart this morning or this afternoon as we look at the word of God when God has laid out for you or I to accept he cares for you and examples are put up to help us to become considerate of the things that God has done for us we believe it because he declared it and that's exactly what we're talking about and I I think about as the scriptures start and what I'm preaching out is who is this Melchizedek how many of you would like to know him better how many would like to know why his purpose was there and then we have another one is that he's laid out for us to look at also as a seed shall not be Heir with a shook if you're counting on being part of a shuck you might as well get it made up but all for Christ and God before us that it said here the seed shall not be here with the Shook and I say to myself dear God you've got to do something for me to make me just that way because we get to a condition that a lot of things don't mean much to us anymore how many of you want to make the rapture how many of you want to see the grace of God I I do we and it takes that in our life and as we look at the things that God has for us we want to do that and I thought one of the last little sermons I chose and set out to preach upon was the Tolkien that if there ever was a need that was needed in the spiritual life of a Christian they are the token that God has laid forth for our lives and I have to say that when the statement is made about the token I also believe that the air will not be air with the or deceived will not be aired with the shuck I believe that comes under obedience and I believe that God cares for you and as we think on these things and my desire is to make us in my little bit of preaching I do to make you more hungry to see Christ than you've ever saw him before that he will deliver you and do great things for you if you will ask and I think about these men and you say well it's just the token but you see there was a lot of things went into the making of the token and I'd like to talk to a few little things that we have for him as they are for you and it was with uh the word of God and how that Moses tried to lead the works of God and got to where he stuttered got to had a lot of problems in his life and when looking for Christ and found him on a Mountainside and said God I can't go on no more I stutter I stagger I do a lot God said how can you say that I made you and the thing of it is I have an ability to make you different Moses Moses said God I got a problem and God said I got your brother coming and he said from now on he said you will tell your brother those Saints amen the recipient set up over on the Mountainside God talking by a by a liner that was lit up by God how would you like to see that same Lantern lit up in your life you say it's not for me I believe it's all for me and as he stepped there and he talked to God about his difficulties that he had and his brother arrived on it they went on out looking to find a way to get the children of Israel delivered from pharaoh and all of his hosts and uh I began to think that as we look at him and we're looking for God talking to him the decisions that need to be made out of our life how many of you believe that God needs you and has his uses for you amen I believe he does I believe there's a purpose for us I believe we do it for that we preach for it we sing for it we talk for it we live for it and I I believe that that's true you either live or you don't live amen amen and I have to believe we're not Society type people how you like my tie that's not what we're talking about how you like my clothes or whatever it's not that I want just print it say something that will touch people's lives and say as for me he cares for me I care for him amen if he lives I live if he does I do amen and we're getting to a place that it's Rapture time and it's time we began to look at the things of God and as we bring up these issues to you there's reason for him in other words it it uh Moses told that Pharaoh he said we're going to destroy this place and you ought to understand by the signs of all the things that we've done we brought the fleas and the Flies and the bugs and we we just tore up your whole place and uh he said well he said I still can't deliver you and finally The Voice came from God to leave him anyway bring the hosts into and the children of Israel and get ready to leave and as you read those things and you begin to look at the purpose to them I said to myself what is he going to face to where are we going uh how many of you know that we're looking at some deep dark hours for America that's only about 10 handholds Grant we got earthquakes it's going to settle this place down like you can't believe and I I'm not here to scare you come on I'm here to tell you that God has got some gifts and offices that he's going to show and he did this to Moses and the thing of it is that the people never believed it some believed it but the word of God came to within 14 days he's going to shut down that water we're going to shut down that light he's going to kill the lamb kind of a strange thing but he did that just the same the word of God said and when he kills that lamb the lamb will no longer be able to offer like a dog a dog can do anything he wants to do at any time but when that is stripped from him he cannot do that and that's what it did to the lamb the lamb no longer could give no longer could do and it became more a demand that God laid upon their lives like being laid upon us it's not a game we're playing one of these days it's going to come to a greater point that you're going to have to be what it is that you hear these people preaching about and talking about amen Because He Lives we live and the example is laid out before us I believe as we see the word of God and what it did it finally drove Moses to doing what he had to do all those enemies and all those tests against the Pharaoh in his army had to show up and away from town he moved and I think on those changes I look at my life and I begin to to judge it because I'm a human being and uh we've lived off our life a good life can you say Amen to that amen we've had our ways in about everything we've wanted to do and it comes difficult sometimes when it's time to do what God asks you to do to pay the price and serving God is something that requires doing that I thought to see the one I wanted to ask was how many of you need to get baptized some people say well it's not necessary but it is amen there's a lot of things that goes into the lesson and as I was reading this and I want to say that the sermon that we're talking about here is who do you say this melchized it is and the thing of it is all of a sudden he begins to show up in our life who do you think God is what are our responsibilities what do things mean something to us uh and I think of those things and I think about Melchizedek and I think about how did he call the children of Israel together and I thought about Moses and I thought about those things that he did what an hour it is that we live in because they're laid to us who is this Melchizedek there's something that's been put on the screen that has began and continues to go even today can you say Amen to that I may miss up on a few of those words but I believe that's true a certain day come and all of a sudden here comes uh uh the cane walking down the street Abraham and a man walks up to him says how you doing Abraham he said I'm doing good just on the way home from a battle and he said I'm Melchizedek and I can see him as he said you know you may not know who I am but I brought you from the land of all and I brought you down to where your mom and daddies are and for some reason or another you moved over to another land and that's where I know where you're at because I directed you to do that and now I see you well who are you sir he said I am Melchizedek amen a man that never had a mother never had a father never had a sister or a brother nothing less but the almighty God stood before him and what an identification it brought to the man that was there and he said my my mind he turned around and gave him a percent of the battle that he just came through and he said thank you and as we begin to look at his life you know that that life began to do business with him and I began to think about him and I think about his life and you know he went and met that melchized egg and he said sir he said I'm feeling good but he said I got no inheritance I got nothing and all of a sudden he begins to tell that Abraham just exactly who I am what I can do and I'm going to change your life and did he not begin to change his life amen the seed will not be here with the shuck amen there was so long that he had to do what he did but he began to change God began to build that vessel into a vessel of Life how many of you want that in your life you want to live for God you want to do for God not just here to to come to church if we could say that but to be Sons and Daughters of God that's where Abraham was he said sir he said I I just nothing he said I got a couple people that live in my house but nothing he said I'll tell you what you do you take a goat you dig a lamb you take this and you lay it out in front of you and you cut it in two and you take those birds and you let it do what it's doing now listen to this huh and he did all that and I think to myself you know I don't know what he thought while he watched it but he stood there and watched it until it got night time and he continued to drive away the enemy that kept eating on it so that it might come to being but all of a sudden without fail God poured out a blessing upon his life bigger than you can imagine put a seed in him that would believe everything that God had to say and I think sometimes in our life it's very difficult to believe what God says it's like Sarah I'll get a woman and she'll survey you and you can have a baby and what have you but that's not what he said you be the Daddy I'll Be The Watcher and here we are that same life is here today the the promotions and the express that God is showing people are are not expressing it or living it and ought to set you alive with it excuse me for being cruel but it is the truth and so we look at him and I taught all of a sudden something began to happen the life of God began to fill those sacrifices that he had began to tell his changes life he became a seed man he became a man of God he believed it and whatever God was saying to me as I read it and we'll talk about some of it to me all I could see was as the day's turn it changed the man how many of you can experience a fee in your life changes that are going on it's more and money it's more houses and lands amen you said you live for him and your mind ought to talk the original Talk not what man would say but what God would say we ought to believe what God has said and not what man has said and we would come to church we would see more of him than anything else and once again I'm not being critical but I'm telling you when you look at the life that this man began to live and like we say about his wife and Abraham he's he's just standing there one day and all of a sudden he spear walked up three men walked up you remember that and he looked at all three men he looked at him and called him my Lord he recognized out of one of them to be that one that was the countered amen when when lot met him just a little bit later the two of them going down there he called them hit their Lords he didn't even identify who it was friends I would ask you today how many of you know why you're here yes you said we're in the wave at you but what can I do for you we serve a ribs in Christ and that's what we ask we want to live for him amen just like Moses did just like Abraham did and Abraham's looking there and all of a sudden God makes him a promise and he said you're a seed you're a spiritual man come with me walked on in there and began to conversation with him he said I'm going to bless you I'm going to give you that boy and Sarah's going to have him he says that Sarah's so old he said and I'm sold but it doesn't make any difference how many of you think you went beyond friends today all things are possible and the thing of it is is that Abraham listened to what he said to Sarah he said sir we're going to visit you well Sarah said well you know if I'm married this other gal or got her and and what we'll do with her is I'll just give her to Abraham and he can take and get a baby out of her and uh things can change and I wanna I wanna say something how many of you know that baby making like with God will change family babies babies are born and they come anointed by God at Birth is that right that's right they come of God they become what God has put together God has created it God has ordained it and when that baby is born that born that baby has got the life of God in his life and it either goes on to me God goes on to be what God would have it and so I think a lot of times in our life we'll do it just a baby or it's just this but that's not soul I mean they come from God they're put together by God and it's put there by a man man gives a seed to the woman the woman gives the seed and the baby's there but without that there wouldn't be I want to tell you about the father your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and how he'll change your life huh for today we're living in the who is this Melchizedek where is that manifestation of father son Holy Spirit who is that one that can deliver that to your thinking and change our minds and hearts where we need him and that's exactly what we're looking for and I think of Abraham when he went and had that baby and Sarah she thought it was a good thing but he was just a young man that never did things right he was a mean and contrary and finally he sent him on down the street with his mama you remember that and he said God will bless you God will watch over you but it didn't make it so he had to finally meet up with Hannah or Sarah and we find out that Sarah then had a baby amen from the seed of life from Abraham can you say amen and then out of that man came the evidence that we have that from him came to the Natural man that God filled and made a community made a world and I I believe that through those things that God has done God has made us and I when you when you look at those promises and you look and see what God has done you know I I think of God's going about his business and God said you know what I'd like you to do I want you to take your boy now and I want you to take him up and I want you to offer him up on the mountain and you know he tells his people that worked for him he said a couple of them get ready we're going he went out and took his boy with him huh amen and on a day or two out there all of a sudden he sees a mountain something about that mountain turned on his life he said sir stop it right here I've got to go up that mountain and I will take the boy with me you stay here we'll take up the fire we'll take up the stone we'll take up everything and he goes up there and they look for lamb and don't see a lamb and Abraham begins to put the place together begins to get it all ready and puts his boy up on there and raises that knife to drive that knife into his bosom and an angel of the Lord spoke up don't do that even because he said there is a lamb that is hidden and he I can see him as he looks out there and just in short ways here was a lamb caught in the thicket amen because of the workings of God the the attitude that that man served God to do what God asked him to do and what God did and he said we want and don't want to do like that we're going to do we're going to bring in other people to do these same things so just finish doing what you're doing and Beyond and as I look at that I begin to think and who is this Melchizedek who is he that has manifested himself in the father in the son and God who is he not not one here one there but the same person the same one I would ask you how many of you know him today how many is that experience been made real to your eye and as we look at the words and the evidences here as we look at them it ought to change our life and make our life different I I began to look at it and I said I got to do this and that and then all of a sudden I get in the seed will not become here with the shuck I said Thank You Jesus there's not enough of anything I can do to change him but there is a God that can make things different and that's exactly what he can do to her life he can make us different and make us what God would have us to be and we ought to start looking for that evidence and you say well I serve God then you ought to know who the servant is who your helper is you say well I got to go get him he's not the second person of the godhead or the third person he's at South same God all the way through one God many purposes to fulfill that life for you or I can you say Amen to that amen we live and serve and become to me every time you take a step you're made aware of an ongoing thing that God has for us you're looking at a grave you're looking at a resurrection amen you're promised one of these days if anything happens you'll be found on the other side is that true how many of you are looking forward to that how many of you know that's a promise when everybody looks at you they shake your head like you're a nobody but you are his amen and he spends his time identify himself to his people to the one that is carrying the the the token I want that token in you I want it alive in you I want it talking to you I want to live it in yet it's alive it's it's we got jobs we got a lot of things but your real job is him serving him in the power of his resurrection we come to church sometimes and can't hardly raise them we come to church don't hardly have a thank you Jesus amen that cares in the problems are getting us down is that the way it's going to be amen it ought to be something that we look forward to that hour that lays just ahead and those things that you see made evidence and when you look at those things like we talked about having them children how that the wolf wife don't have much to do with it but she has a water blood and spirit that has things to do with it when the baby becomes alive a lot of things become changed a lot of things ideas become real and we begin to look and to see God like God would have us and that's what I think today the put the purpose in the uh thing that God has a token it takes God to put it in your life how many of you want it working how many of you know that God puts it there to take care when the issue comes up you got the finances to take care of it amen it's like you have to have a token to get on an airplane you present the plane the money and then they give them the token and you get in then when we have that token that token lives in you had token is alive in you amen not here not not but the Sheck but you're you're somebody in Christ yes it ought to change our life and ought to put a hope way down deep in our our life and so as we look at some of these issues I'm reminded constantly about the things that God has done with us to make us what we are you say about the hour that we live in amen he promised that token would be alive when you need pavement you write that token with me there and so to me what it does it begins to tell to me the answer of it who is this Melchizedek who is his father the one that you call Father one you call the son when you call and you fail to recognize that he is that father Son and Holy Ghost in him is that power and that life that we have and I think as we look at this and they begin to consider it it changes your life how many of you know by what you know is where your strength is when you know he lives then you know you have strength then you ought to be able not just to say it but you ought to know that God Lives in You whether you're sleeping or walking you know that's true and I believe that as we look things in our life we begin to see we need God in our life we need him to move with our family we need him to move in our businesses we need a lot of things we need God alive in our lives and I begin to look at these other men and their lives such as the seed will not be aired with a shuck I begin to look at our life how many of you know what you learn is what you call I know he lives do you know he lives you say yes I do because my life is different than it was and my life and my problems are become different so you learn two things three things for or is he alive in you as he is there and so as we begin to study the word of God and we begin to look I believe it's just like I think about uh the prophet of our hour and how that he met the Lord up in the mountain and he said Lord he said I'd like you to get those squirrels and God said I ain't got no squirrels amen he said to him you've got the squirrels you see and he said you talk a little bit more he said if you get those squirrels he said I don't know where they're at he made another statement I never had them and he was down on the tree before that you remember and God said what are you doing here he said I'm hunting where you hunting he said sheep or uh squirrels and he said where you want them he said I want one on that branch I wanted to come down that Mountainside yeah right amen and I mean that I tell that devil did you get what I got I'm telling you get out of my life get out of my sight get out of my being Because He Lives you say y'all lower your voice friends when you know who he's there and you know what's going it's the voice amen anybody that needs to know he lives is and once you know he lives once you know he's there amen you will pull back the news and you will say it like you mean it with all your heart amen it's not we doing it it's him doing it it's we needing it that's why he said to Abraham how are you brother well he said just got back from the war how'd you do all we wanted well who are you sir he said I'm Melchizedek he said you know I brought you down in the family and I took you over here to this land he said I'm just going to do things Mama friends what would this church be like if we was to hear more of those things stressed in our heart and life you are his amen you're greater he that lives in you than he lives in the world so he tells that God he said God yeah I want my squirrels and the thing of it is is that when you begin to read what he's saying the angel of the Lord is telling him he said the squirrels are yours I think of that and I say to myself all right down to the mountain he goes and he said I want those squirrels back he said and I want that squirrel to come back I want you to come down here and then did he follow him he did and then the second one in other words he called them and can I ask you a question does not the god that you serve and live by do you not talk to him do you not call his name and require things out of his life will you not repeat sometime what you heard me say that God said that those shiver for those squirrels were not his but they belong to you I had already gave them to you so you can't find them speak the word you'll get it and all of a sudden we begin to change our attitude towards God hallelujah Because He Lives amen he called that squirrel down that squirrel come down and he landed on that mountain and he shot him and he said to himself then there's another one there and he said I want him to come down for the seed and the shuck ain't gonna matter God separated them and so he stood there and he said I want that squirrel to come down there I wanted to come out over here want him to come down here I want him here and I know that they won't get in that poison plant like that is but I want that squirrel to rise in that pointed uh Bush and get out there on that bush and hear that squirrel came down and all I'm asking you brothers and sisters if you know he's a liver how about talking to him if you know who he is it ought to change our heart and life that's what we're talking about he never stayed the same he identified himself to URI as God almighty is that right amen and he ought to be so real to you or I today amen that we claim things for God but anyway they come down there and he said thank you and he's shouting he gathers those two squirrels up takes them down to the car and goes out and something says to him hey what about that third one oh he said I forgot it because it was done differently and I say to you that have lived for him hey you know him and that's what he did he went back the next day and he got a hold of that other squirrel which was promised and you know he goes home and he said Brethren I don't know how these things come about but he said because of what I said those squirrels were there and you say to me brother Patterson I don't know why it was but all I did was ask somebody something and I'll tell you something when I got home it was so real to me I can't believe it I sit in the house of God where we're sitting here now and worried about what's on TV at home or you want to hear what God's got huh and you say I want to hear what I have heard God say friends I've heard a lot of precious things from my heavenly father and he's told me many times that he loved me and I sang you a song this morning and you sang to me he cares for you sing it with all your heart because I got needs I got family I got things we need you said well brother Patterson maybe I need to go down and get some money and do it that's all up to you but I'm telling you that once you learn of him you begin to learn of him friends if you spoke squirrels into existence would you not learn how to speak squirrels into existence would you not know how to call God on the scene huh would you not there it's not something that you have to work for but that's exactly with him he takes his deacons and he goes home to Hannah he was her name she was their little woman and he's standing there and he's having dinner he said I spoke to them squirrels and I brought him to where they were and I shot him but how did I get him there how did I get him and they could not answer because what it is was that they were spoken there he was speaking to him they were his something was going on he realized that because God Lives I live because God made a promise it's to you as well as it is to me maybe screaming too loud but he said ladies and men he said tell me please how did what I say bring those squirrels into existence and I'll guarantee you what if the word of God is true and the the Melchizedek and God that's walking around here today just like this and you get to talking to him he'll Square them shoulders and he'll start walking around like he owns this place and he'll say what's your problem son use everybody say that to you I say if you have any kind of life at all you've met him one two ah you are a medium and he said the same God I met there is the same God I meet here he's not a new God he's a God that said that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll go with you to the very end and the thing of it is this little lady said I don't know we don't know he said well I I just don't know he said I just and I shot him he said what do you think of that sister Hattie and he said sir he said I need my boys saved huh friends I'll tell you something how many of you believe God heard reply how many of you believe her boys found its place at the meal house and met God there that day at that hour I want to ask you the same reason you say how is that you know there was a woman one day she told Jesus he met her I won't turn over there and quote it but he said something well you know the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table and the great God huh Melchizedek he makes a statement I never heard nothing like that is that what he said he said I never heard that and because you said it your daughters made well and I'm going to get on about my job only a little bit different because of what you said to me and I say to you today in making that statement it's got to be deeper than than what we can imagine greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world somewhere another the reality of it ought to come into place and ought to change our heart and life she made that statement she said my boys need to get saved my boys need to get saved immediately God filled them with the Holy Spirit God changed their life just like the little woman that made her statement and I I begin to look at some of those statements and the things that God is doing in our life you know it's it's a shame sometimes I just ask you how many of you need to be baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ not father son Holy Ghost if you haven't got it right you need to get right if there's more that come in here in Saturday or Sunday amen needs to be asked the same thing how many of you need to get saved we're baptized we want to get some of those things taken care of you might say I don't know what it is but I'm talking about we're talking about a God that promise said I will not allow the seat in the shuck to grow together amen you don't have to prove a lot of trash because he lives so are you get happy be what God would make you to be and so we look these things in our life and who is this Melchizedek he's still living amen the church comes up and said well he's three people and one God brother Brown said how can that be three persons in one he said that's not so it's one person in three positions he's the father he's the son and he's the Holy Ghost amen when you talk to the Lord Jesus Christ you ought to know when he was born he wasn't born of a man like everybody else was by sex he was born by God huh without anything there but him and here he is today making an Evidence to you or I there's a reason that those things are put there is so that you and I know who it is friends if anybody's ahead in this it's him if anybody knows when he's coming it's him amen and what we need to know are those things but I begin to look at the word of God and by some of these things and I thought maybe that the Brethren had those uh scriptures on if but if they don't have it we can read them but I wanted to read about him and what he said about it can we do it for this Melchizedek came to Salem Priests of the most high God who me Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom again Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being the interpreted the king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is the king of Peace imagine he's looking at this how many of you or I realize just who alive he is and how might he is without father without mother without descent neither beginning of day nor end of life but made like an unto the Son of God applied the priests continually I think if a guy could read that every day no matter what kind of opposition you would have it would give you victory because he lives and I can see Abraham as he turned around and met him I can see him as he said I brought you home I'm the one who did this and I'm going to change your life and as we're looking at those today here and I think that what a change it ought to make in our life and as I read I begin to see and to think about him so I begin to read a little bit more who is Melchizedek and who's the things that he met and I'd like to ex made mention of those things because we're wanting a token and we're wanting it alive we want to live separately from the shock we want the seed to be here how many of you know that Ishmael I believe it was was Abraham's boy and he was the one that everybody followed but Abraham was like that he was the seed man he was the man that knew God from the beginning to the end and those are the things that we're talking about here like we talked about the squirrels talk about healing what brings about healing and in the end of this sermon who is this Melchizedek how many of you can remember what was preached he preached I think it was three or four sermons their marriage and divorce people who troubled with that for many years and God spoke to them on marriage and divorce he broke the message to it made an understanding to them about what God thought about you being married to another woman that wasn't the one you were just married to and his purpose and those things put out instead of Dying by all the problem why don't you spend some time getting things straightened out by God and I said all right Lord let us do things that the way you'd have done and so I began to look at this and every time I see him I see that word of God changed and made more alive today than we can ever imagine let me just turn over here if I can here he said now as we approach the word how many of you believe in the word of God can I tell you something if you got a denominational attitude you don't know the word you may call it the word but you don't know it so what you do is you learn who it is because God will not deal with you if you don't use the word huh and I think sometimes we don't use the word Lord you promised us you said this we do this and I'm not picking I'm just trying to get across the thought to you and to me but this is what he said he said that approach the written word we ask that and you take the written word and you make it live to us tonight friends I think that's what he did that's not my squirrel that's yours it's the word of God friends you can read this and it goes in one ear and out the other and then on the other hand you can read it to where it changes your life amen there's passages here that to understand these things like that woman that told the Lord something he said and all of Israel have never heard that voice so go home your daughters heel now and so everything is all right I think it's the same thing we're hearing today as we see these things but listen to what he sets it up and then while reading the first three verses and then he begins to talk about he said think of the great person I mean think about how great he is father son Holy Ghost you're talking to the father worth anything talking to the son worth anything talking to the Holy Spirit addressing him in a measure that you would have him dressed in oh God I personally want to know him better amen I want to be like I want the token I want to live with the power of God say well the enemy broke me but I'll tell you something that God put the payday in the till and no matter what that enemy does to you the token will take care of the problem but you don't put the token in there he cannot solve the problem so get it in there make sure God knows it's there and we live in that you say well I don't want to be like Moses and I don't want to be like that but let me ask you a question amen there was all those men they all give up that idea ten men gave up that idea two men stayed with that token and a little old Harlot a harlot met him sir what are you doing well and he began to explain the Tolkien and he said you'll put this in your windowsill do not cross it leave it do not do this with it but you hold it where it is and it'll stay true and when this place comes down ten of them didn't believe it Joshua and another man did and they lived the other ten died but did it work or didn't it yes it did she may not understood but I'll guarantee she held on to that token and I'll guarantee you something when you realize that token is on you that will pay for every bill you got it I'd make sure I had him and the power of his resurrection let the anybody let the guy come in to bury you but I tell my wife don't look for me under grass honey because I ain't going to be under grass I'm going up amen as for me it's crimes you say Michael that's just nonsense but you'd be surprised how I like that because I know he knows me you say you're such a wonderful person I have to say that's not true but I talked to my papa and my daddy knows who I am en and things begin to make change and our life begins to to add to this and as we begin to look at our life and some of these things I'm trying to repeat to you about the person and he said in another side that uh he was a priesthood and he said that was melchizedek's priesthood they called him a priesthood because men were joined up to it he said he is father son Holy Ghost he is the fullness of that priesthood no greater than him how many of you know him the Lord Jesus Christ born huh amen born of God himself that we might have him live in our life don't know how long we've been talking but let me just read a few more things here he said and the person is eternal if you notice he had no father he had no mother he has no other things and he has no time that's even endured either who is this that shall live tonight because the Bible says here that neither father nor mother nor beginning of day nor ending of life in other words that he's alive and let me just say something we're going to close this out but you know when God said and you hear the word and you're a theologian can I tell you most theologians do not know the word they know a Bible but they don't know the word therefore they don't quote it like it's supposed to be and I say that to you or I as we look at this through the who is this Melchizedek he's telling the people now at night time God puts uh hanky over this will say and he said that a lot of times whatever God don't want revealed he put the hanky over you don't see it but isn't that what they did when when uh born can't think of the thought to put that one that uh worked on that body so much created him alive created him before God but anyway we see that this man here doing these same things but God covers them you say Well they're covered but when God wants to deal with them he takes the covering off and he digs and works on him and then he covers them again and so he tells you that a lot of things in life he covers up like uh they did too was it Moses had recognized that great when it got and he hit him in the leg because he liked him who Michelangelo and the thing of it was is that that we're talking about a theologian because he covers that gospel and what we want is the gospel that lives and you say well if the Theologian said it if your denominations say it then you got problems but we want that we want God because the Theologian cannot walk up and take the word of God and start using it all he can do is he has to stay with the word the way he understands it but you get somebody alive with the power of the Resurrection amen that knows that God is alive then the thing of it is you begin to tell these people what it is this is the fullness this is the godhead this is God's dealing and think of the life that we would have once become acquainted with the life of almighty God but the Theologian never can change you say well I believe that well a year from now you'll listen to that Theologian and you'll believe him till you don't know what to do but it never changes it's where Melchizedek is where God it's the fullness of the godhead is what brings it alive and the thing of it is is that as we look at life and we look at the penalties of life in there who is this Melchizedek it can change those words take that covering off that carving and show you that have eternal life big word eternal life to me that's a awful big word and God knows you as a eternal life individual and he knows that only word can hear God is a prophet and he's the one that quotes the word of God to URI the word of God did you read it you say that's nothing but God talking to me and he's telling me very important issues I think sometimes brothers and sisters I think we're talking about things that can I get over just talking about our wives and she wants to talk about the husband but the thing of it is how many of you want to walk a little deeper how many of you want to see Christ alive in their life that's what I'm talking about and I think if we're not careful we try to build certain things because you don't know who it is that you know we're still messing with parts and little old things when you're talking to an eternal God Because He Lives it ought to change our lives I think it ought to cost something in our heart in life I think that when we leave out of here I think sometimes people don't pray how many of you pray when you leave and ask God to change your life then it's necessary isn't it and you expect it but if you go and and you don't do that you go out about business and nothing is done about it and you say Michael you're just being cruel I'm not being cruel I'm not a man that just don't practice the word of God I want life I want to see the power of God heal the sick I want to see him see that God Lives tonight that they know themselves he lives and I'll tell you something else if you start out 50 years ago and I have longer than that I guess I know him better today than I did then and you ought to know him better and the thing of it is is that then when you begin to meet him you just turn around and kneel down here one of these seats and raise them hands to God who are you anyway ladies man God I need help God I am yours you know that you're my father you're my Holy Spirit but the time you go many times and don't pay no attention to what God's doing you'll walk and forget about the need that you have in your body and they only want to quotes to it is that theophany or that church that your people go to rather than one that God has imagine living at a church today that is preaching the Living Word of God that you know it is the word of God and you know it is the promise of God not a system that's holding it having to repeat it and I'm telling you because he lives I'm telling that's fresh today and because he said that that seed will be different than the shuck you ought to start hollering thank you and when you start seeing God rewarding your life ought to be nothing it changes our life we ought to go to crying out to God how do you stay warm without it how do you stay alive with God if God don't live in you ladies huh you're worried about your hubby friends you got a bigger problem than that one man what's your problem you got a bigger problem than she is you got a bigger problem than the job you got a bigger problem anywhere how to raise them paws up see God you got to do something for me after all you were born of him ah you could call him daddy you say no Floyd's Daddy no God is your daddy and you have an eternal life in you let us be Who We Are tell that enemy I will not be an heir I am like Abraham amen he was the one that said Sarah you have the baby that's going to live now you passed me another woman I'll take care of the other woman but I'm going to guarantee you we're going to have to do something with that maybe ah it's not true amen I have seen about a hundred years old and she has that baby and then here's Abraham now he's got a real living child the seed now makes the boast as for him that lives I know him how you doing boy how he said doing fine daddy how you doing Daddy we're going up on the mountain boy okay Daddy whatever we're packing all this weapons of daddy what's the deal it's all right son don't worry about it okay Daddy didn't bother him any even because he was part of his daddy daddy got up there and said son he said we got the thing all built got the wood all out gonna go out here what you're gonna do he said I want you up here laying on here did he oppose it oh he got up there he said there's no lamb here so and God raised that knife with it as I said where it drove it but God showed up God said don't do that that's fine and I just tell you tonight brothers and sisters honestly he's coming how many of you think you might need to know him better if he could come huh how many of you believe in the voice of God are able to create a message incidentally I read a page or two of a book you give me the other day brother your wife and I said that man saw a pillar of Fire and he fell in love with that Pillar of Fire and I say to you today that God that lives brothers and sisters ought to be alive and you're in my heart and life and I say that if it is may God bless you amen I just believe that when you run into a difficulty who is this Melchizedek he'll take care of it you say brother Mike I don't have nobody he'll take care of it amen and I think if I was you and you were me I just turned around I deal myself at that place I'd raised my hand say God a lot of things don't matter I need them to matter I need a conversation I need a devotion Lord I'm more interested in the TV than you may God help us may God bless this message to you because I'm telling you you'll hear something but it won't be his word I said God please don't let me hear something like that amen because that Theologian will tell you just the way God told you earlier but God through is that right if you want to read it you can read it you know what God does to a word like that that's laid out the Bible says to you or I what he does is he says attributes he said and then I will send attributes to that word I said you got to be kidding me imagine the word you say there's nothing here no hope and all of a sudden God comes by with an attribute I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen you got that squirrel you got that answer I'll tell you what it is there it is there it is there it is that's who we serve and if you don't believe that's in there about them aptitudes attitudes God said these God out there they believe certain things but he said I'll put New Attitudes in it how many of you believe the word of God has got New Attitudes in it that when you first start reading it how many of you believe that he lives today more than he ever lived before if we could say that and what we're talking about is real because what he did the unbeliever will never believe but I'll put something in it that will make that word of God become a greater presence to you than you've ever read it before in your life may God bless you would you stand with me this morning or today I'm sorry our heavenly father as we stand in the presence and realize the devotion Lord that you showed people you took to church put 2 000 people a thousand people in each side of this I've been there Lord and he stood there and he couldn't look to pulp it out and see him he put it right towards the wall and preached those messages to those people that were sitting there the message that we repeated tonight Lord we're repeating today about those questions and those answers and I say God please don't let me be made with a shuck let me be different please let me understand Lord Who You Are Who We Are and may it be here in this building Lord may we understand what your doing for hearts and lives bless his father we ask it whoever they are Lord may you touch their heart may they not believe a theologian nor theophany Lord but may they hear their ever-present word of God and it's life we ask it Lord of you in Jesus name amen can I tell you something in closing brother Bram told those people he's facing this wall he says to a thousand people on his left he said I can't see who you are he said but if you're sick [Music] call on God you might say what does it make friends it's what brings God to appearance make a call and he said there's a lady there now who's got cancer I don't know about you but he told her and God healed him [Music] and you say well I don't know about that well there was one there that he told him about marriage and divorce and he said I told him go ahead and live like you're living God answered something touched brother Branham to tell that man some Roy Roberson how many of you heard Roy Roberson and what a friend he is of brother Branham and he made that statement he took such a part in that man's cry well think about this people here thinking out about me and are you praying for me to help me is going to help me and then all of a sudden he changed it he said there's another lady laying over on the right on that cot and said she can't get around she's got cancer bad [Music] imagine that he said she's got cancer all I can say is he's talking to God it's like you you telling me that God's not hearing me talk you hear that you you don't think that God pays any attention to what I'm saying [Music] and he said lady Jesus Christ makes you well she gets up out of that cot he couldn't get close to touch her but by a thought laid upon his heart he spoke it then I say to you how many of you tonight have a request on your heart and by the grace of God I will remember those questions how many of you will remember mine how many of you will remember my needs [Music] you say it doesn't work brother Patterson yes it does work [Music] but who are we we're not beginners whose brothers are wrong up here a beginner he knows him may God richly bless you as you go and if you need to turn around and heal that seat you're not going to hurt nobody's feelings we go on do whatever but may God bless you remember us in your prayers huh because he's showing himself is that right he went from where he was all the way up to this hour by William Branham do you think he's still teaching people things do you think he's still talking about the rapture I believe he is and I believe he knows who's going to be there [Music] may God richly bless you hey God you are dismissed God bless you to turn back over to the center excuse me brother Roy [Music] lose I can face tomorrow because he lives [Music] [Applause] [Music] he holds the future this life is [Music] one more time [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes I know he holds my future [Music] this life is where the living just because he lives let's bow our heads tonight Heavenly Father Lord as we come before
