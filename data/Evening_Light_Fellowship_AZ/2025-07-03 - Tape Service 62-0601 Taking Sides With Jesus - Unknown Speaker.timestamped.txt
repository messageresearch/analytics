[5:27] oh, all fear is gone.
[5:33] Because I know
[5:38] he holds my future
[5:42] and life is worth the living just
[5:48] because he lives. Let's sing verse one.
[5:52] Oh, God sent his son.
[5:57] Oh, they called him Jesus.
[6:02] He came to love,
[6:07] heal, and forgive.
[6:11] He lived and died.
[6:16] Oh, to bind my pardon
[6:21] and an empty grave is there to prove my
[6:26] Savior lives. Amen. Oh, because he
[6:32] lives.

[6:49] And because I know, yes, I know. Behold
[6:56] my future.
[6:59] And life is worth the living just
[7:04] because he lives.
[7:09] Amen. He lives tonight.
[7:12] Amen.
[7:14] If uh Brother Brian, you'd come to pray.
[7:16] We only have one need tonight. And if
[7:18] we'd remember Sister Gracia, she's at
[7:20] home sick. If we would just remember her
[7:23] in prayer as Brother Brian takes the
[7:25] needs before the Lord.
[7:27] Let's
[7:29] [Music]
[7:32] bow our hearts,
[7:34] dear precious heavenly father.
[7:38] We're so grateful to have a place to go
[7:41] to where we can hear your word, Lord.
[7:44] And on this midweek service,
[7:47] Lord, we come expecting to hear from
[7:50] you.
[7:52] We need more of you every day, Lord.
[7:55] We pray that your spirit
[7:58] would flow through this building like a
[8:00] milky substance in the air,
[8:04] engulfing every soul, every person.
[8:08] Lord, we just ask that your spirit would
[8:10] help us and guide us and keep us and
[8:13] draw us closer to you.
[8:16] We pray for spoken and unspoken requests
[8:20] of the hearts. Lord, touch everyone.
[8:24] Send your spirit and heal them all.
[8:28] We pray that the word that goes forth
[8:30] tonight, Lord,
[8:33] get us that step closer to getting out
[8:36] of here.
[8:38] We love you. We thank you. And we just
[8:42] ask these things in the precious name of
[8:44] the King of Kings, Lord Jesus Christ.
[8:48] Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[8:52] Amen. If we could sing nothing but the
[8:54] blood. Thankful for the blood tonight.

[16:52] God alone."
[16:55] Amen.
[16:57] You are not a God created
[17:02] by human hand. You are not a God
[17:07] dependent
[17:09] on any mortal man. And you are not a God
[17:14] in need of
[17:17] anything. We can give by your plan.
[17:22] That's just the way it is. Sing that
[17:25] verse one more time.
[17:28] For you are not a God created
[17:33] by human hand. And you are not a God
[17:38] dependent
[17:40] on any mortal man. For you are not a God
[17:45] in need of of anything we can give by
[17:51] your plan. That's just the way it is.
[17:58] Oh for you are God alone
[18:01] from before time began. No worship in
[18:05] the night.
[18:08] Oh, thank you Lord. You are God alone.
[18:13] And right now in the good times and bad
[18:20] you are on your throne.
[18:23] And you are God alone.
[18:29] You're the only God whose power
[18:34] none can contend. And you're the only
[18:38] God whose name
[18:41] the praise will never end. You're the
[18:44] only God who's worthy
[18:48] of everything we can give. For you are
[18:52] God and that's just the way it is.
[18:57] [Music]
[18:58] Oh, for you are God alone
[19:02] from before time began
[19:06] and you are on your throne.
[19:09] And you are God alone.
[19:13] And right now in the good times and bad,
[19:20] you are on your throne.
[19:23] Oh, you are God alone.
[19:27] You're unchangeable,
[19:31] Lord. Unshakeable.
[19:34] You're unstoppable.
[19:38] That's who you are.
[19:41] You're unchangeable.
[19:45] Oh, unshakeable.
[19:48] You're unstoppable.
[19:51] That's what you are.
[19:55] You are God alone
[19:58] from before time began.
[20:01] And you are on your throne.
[20:05] And you are God alone.
[20:09] And right now in the good times and bad,
[20:16] you are on your throne.
[20:19] You are God alone.
[20:24] Amen. He's God alone.
[20:28] He's the ruler on high.
[20:30] He's the omnipotent one. He's the King
[20:34] of Kings and the Lord of Lords. And he's
[20:38] your savior. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[20:40] Your redeemer.
[20:42] Amen. Amen. God bless you all this
[20:45] evening. I greet you in the lovely name
[20:47] of Jesus Christ. You can be seated for
[20:49] just a moment. Say a few things here.
[20:52] I'm just happy to be home. was over
[20:54] there in Columbia, South Carolina with
[20:57] brother Benny Perry. And uh they rented
[21:00] a a school house there to because he
[21:04] invited all kinds of different churches
[21:06] in the area. And uh I don't know how
[21:09] many ministers that was there because
[21:11] many times they're saying, "Oh, brother
[21:13] so and so, stand up, brother." This and
[21:15] that. And I don't know most of those
[21:17] brethren back there, but um Brother
[21:19] Benny Perry sends his greetings. Uh,
[21:22] brother Bley Williams was there also and
[21:26] he spoke on uh on Saturday to the youth
[21:30] and uh uh brother Jason and his son
[21:34] Matthew Watkins were there and brother u
[21:37] Paul Beard, brother Juel Forny,
[21:40] uh brother Mike Halloway uh there's just
[21:44] a bunch of them and so I bring you their
[21:46] greetings and uh I I was sitting in the
[21:50] back. had the the school auditorium and
[21:54] there was a drummer and their musicians
[21:57] and everything up there and that drummer
[21:58] was so loud and they had me right on a
[22:00] couch uh from me to you from and this
[22:04] guy's beating on them drums now I'm
[22:06] telling you and I I just said I can't
[22:09] even think. So I had I sitting in the
[22:12] far back on the back row like some of
[22:14] you guys you come in church you sit on
[22:16] the back row you want to sit on get
[22:18] closest to the door so you went and
[22:21] anyway sitting there on far back and so
[22:24] brother Bley he comes behind me and he's
[22:28] you know hey brother Ron how you doing
[22:30] and stuff like that and then he slaps me
[22:32] on top of the head and he got a big old
[22:35] mosquito a mosquito was on top of my
[22:37] head he slapped he said I said well
[22:39] thank you man I
[22:41] You know,
[22:44] I wonder why he slapped me on the head.
[22:46] He got a mosquito up there. Anyway, um
[22:49] listen, we're going to we're going to
[22:51] finish up the tape tonight on taking
[22:54] sides with Jesus. I don't know if we'll
[22:56] actually be able uh to finish it all,
[22:58] but we're going to start on paragraph
[23:00] 71. And what I'd like you to do, I want
[23:03] you to understand that this prophet's
[23:06] ministry, he's he's born a prophet. How
[23:08] many know he's born a prophet? But now,
[23:12] Brother Brandham is wondering about his
[23:14] ministry. What is God doing? I'm going
[23:17] off of the scene. Why is this explosion?
[23:20] Why these visions? Why is seven angels?
[23:23] Why do I have to go west? Uh, you know,
[23:26] and meet with seven angels. What is all
[23:28] of this about? Am I going off the scene?
[23:30] Surely nobody will live through an
[23:32] explosion like that. and uh uh he begins
[23:37] to now feel a transition,
[23:40] understand a transition in his ministry.
[23:43] So he preaches a couple sermons uh
[23:45] present stage of my ministry uh and uh
[23:50] uh
[23:53] another one current stage of my
[23:55] ministry, present stage or whatever, but
[23:57] uh ministry explained. And he he's he's
[24:01] letting the people know now God has been
[24:04] doing something and he's changing me.
[24:08] And he says, I see that where all my
[24:10] trouble has come is he says that I have
[24:14] mixed uh being an evangelist
[24:17] and a prophetic gift at the same time.
[24:21] And he says that's been the permissive
[24:24] will. Now understand when a prophet is
[24:26] coming into
[24:28] his perfect will ministry. Let me say
[24:31] this. God uses all of this. You say,
[24:36] "Well, brother Ron, from for from 33 or
[24:39] the beginning of the tapes of where they
[24:41] uh in 19 uh 47 onward,
[24:46] uh do we only listen to the tapes that
[24:48] are from 63 onward from the No. But when
[24:52] you actually when you start taking the
[24:55] tapes in chronological order and I've
[24:58] done that start all the way back as 47
[25:01] and 48 49 50 and you begin to see his
[25:04] ministering growing you begin to see uh
[25:08] brother Brennham 1956 has a sermon um
[25:12] that he says what is a vision and he
[25:14] says he talks about first second and
[25:16] third pole first time he's ever
[25:18] mentioned that over the pulpit and he
[25:20] says now Jes Jesus had three poles.
[25:23] Moses had three poles. And he goes on
[25:25] and on. And he says, "Now watch that
[25:28] first pull." And he begins to explain
[25:30] it. And remember, he has this vision. He
[25:33] says, he sees a little baby shoe and
[25:35] he's trying to take a rope, a good size,
[25:38] like a quarter inch rope, and put it
[25:40] through the eyelet of the baby shoe.
[25:44] And he sees that it's not working. And
[25:46] the angel of the Lord says, "You're
[25:48] trying to teach Pentecostal babies
[25:50] supernatural things." Amen. And he said,
[25:53] "I've told you not to to to try to
[25:55] explain it." And when you when you've
[25:57] done this, when you've explained it,
[26:00] because Brother Bram's very transparent,
[26:03] and he says, um, you know, he begins to
[26:06] explain his ministry. What happens is,
[26:10] uh, he's creating carnal impersonations,
[26:13] right? And he said they're going to
[26:15] follow along and you'll see somebody's
[26:17] going to have a gift in the hand. Some
[26:19] are going to start discerning and on and
[26:22] on and so brother Brennham now you
[26:25] understand they're coming I I call it a
[26:28] fulcrum.
[26:31] It's like from 1933
[26:35] he's preaching about first second and
[26:37] third pole. He's preaching about what
[26:39] God's going to do what God's doing. And
[26:42] when he comes to the opening of the
[26:45] seals, he's crossed over now into
[26:47] another realm. Amen. But prior to that,
[26:51] prior to that, he's making all of the
[26:53] message believers, hey, what God is
[26:56] doing, he's changing my ministry. It's
[26:58] not going to be anything sinful. He
[27:01] said, "Watch, it may be a little moving
[27:03] back, a little, you know, nothing sinful
[27:07] uh by any means." and he says, "But I
[27:09] just feel that I'll be pulling back."
[27:11] Now, understand that from the time that
[27:15] he gets into this portion of his
[27:17] ministry, he never goes back into world
[27:20] evangelism again. He's not out going
[27:22] into Africa and all of the different
[27:24] places. He's done that. Remember, the
[27:27] first and second poll are um gathering
[27:32] polls. Everybody's come. Nobody was
[27:34] offended by first and second poll.
[27:37] Nobody. discernments, miracles, signs,
[27:40] wonders. Many of them came to to see
[27:43] Brother Brennan work his gift. In fact,
[27:44] Billy Paul told me, he said, "Uh, daddy
[27:47] was telling me," said brother Ron or
[27:49] excuse me, he says, "Uh, uh, Paul," he
[27:52] said, "these people, uh, the full gospel
[27:55] businessmen have told me, uh, we want
[27:58] you, brother Brennham, to come and work
[28:01] your gift, but don't preach, right?
[28:04] because your preaching is offensive and
[28:07] and uh you you're not a learned man. So
[28:10] leave the preaching to us. And so they
[28:13] wanted to use brother Brennham just as a
[28:15] calling card to bring the people in. You
[28:18] you follow that? And so, uh, he says,
[28:21] uh, even watch this. When brother
[28:24] Brennham said that he wanted to to, um,
[28:28] maybe build another church because the
[28:30] tabernacle was becoming too small. And
[28:34] they remodeled the tabernacle for the
[28:37] opening of the seals.
[28:39] But I was speaking with brother uh Billy
[28:42] Paul when we were traveling together and
[28:45] he says that his daddy says um Paul he
[28:50] told brother Billy he called him most of
[28:53] the time Paul. He says uh Paul he says I
[28:57] wanted to build a bigger church to hold
[29:00] the people and hold them comfortably. He
[29:02] says but they voted me down and they
[29:04] only wanted to do uh a small expansion.
[29:08] He said, ' That's what they think of my
[29:10] ministry. Amen. Now, understand, not
[29:13] everybody's catching brother Brennham is
[29:14] a prophetic ministry at this time.
[29:17] They're seeing that he's a great man of
[29:18] God and it there's been signs and
[29:21] wonders. Supernatural is happening. But
[29:23] remember, Pentecost was full of
[29:25] supernatural.
[29:27] So, there's got to be something far
[29:29] greater than just supernatural.
[29:31] Okay? And uh uh because uh with 1906 and
[29:36] and Pentecost was coming on real real
[29:39] strong and so when brother Brennham was
[29:43] told by the angel said you're going to
[29:45] be given two gifts as Moses was given
[29:48] two gifts and uh as John the Baptist
[29:53] forrun the first coming you and your
[29:55] ministry your message is going to forrun
[29:58] the second coming of Christ. And so we
[30:00] see that John the Baptist even he
[30:04] introduced he said behold the lamb of
[30:06] God.
[30:07] That was his introduction.
[30:10] And it's amazing that in the scriptures
[30:12] there are people still following John
[30:15] after Jesus is introduced because John
[30:19] sent two of his disciples to ask Jesus
[30:23] are you the one or do we seek another?
[30:25] Now imagine
[30:27] brother Brennham said that John the
[30:29] Baptist suffered
[30:31] in prison
[30:33] and and he himself said he got offended.
[30:38] Brother Brendan was talking about that
[30:40] John the Baptist got offended that Jesus
[30:43] didn't break him out of prison
[30:47] and why if I'm the forerunner and is
[30:50] this really him is this what we expected
[30:54] and uh remember they sent two of the
[30:56] disciples to go ask him are you the one
[30:59] or do we look for another he said you go
[31:01] tell John these things and uh one of
[31:05] them was blessed is he who's not
[31:08] offended in me. Brother Bram said he got
[31:11] his answer right there because he had
[31:13] been offended. And so
[31:17] John the Baptist goes off of the scene.
[31:20] Now let's look at shadow and type for a
[31:23] moment because brother Brim said, "I am
[31:25] a typologist.
[31:27] As it was, so will it be." So here you
[31:30] have John the Baptist in the first
[31:33] forerunning of Christ and he come and he
[31:36] was like a a reed shaken in the wind. He
[31:40] didn't come with all the fanfare of of
[31:43] the ministry. He didn't have robes. He
[31:45] he he he ate locust and wild honey. He
[31:49] had a beard and and animal skins around
[31:51] him. And I think brother Bram said he
[31:53] was from a young boy on. He was out in
[31:55] the wilderness and and that's where John
[31:58] the Baptist had learned about God in the
[32:00] wilderness. Okay? And that's why he used
[32:02] in parables all the time the axes laid
[32:05] to the root of the tree. Taking natural
[32:07] things and bringing it into spiritual.
[32:10] But you see John said, "I've got to
[32:14] decrease that he might increase."
[32:17] So you see a pulling back of John the
[32:20] Baptist so that Christ will be raised
[32:24] up. Do you understand that? So now when
[32:28] John the Baptist was beheaded and went
[32:30] off the scene,
[32:32] was there a return ministry?
[32:38] If you say return ministry, well,
[32:40] Matthew 24, when the uh uh earth did
[32:43] quake and the uh rocks did rent and
[32:46] graves of the saints came open and there
[32:48] was a resurrection and they were seen
[32:50] within the city, right? We know that.
[32:52] Okay. Well, John the Baptist come up,
[32:53] but did he have to reintroduce Christ?
[32:56] No. See, you have to stay with the
[32:59] scriptures. Amen. Okay. Now, what's
[33:01] amazing is when Jesus asks the
[33:05] disciples, "Who do they say that I, the
[33:07] son of man, am?"
[33:10] Do you remember their their answer?
[33:12] Well, well, Jeremiah or Isaiah or one of
[33:15] the prophets raised up. Where did they
[33:17] get that? Return ministry has been
[33:20] around. That doctrinal teaching's been
[33:22] around for a long time. But you see, so
[33:25] John the Baptist when he went off of the
[33:28] scene, Christ was there. Okay? Now this
[33:31] forerunner does not beho say behold the
[33:35] the lamb. What does he say? Behold the
[33:38] lamb's wife. Amen. Because even brother
[33:42] Bram said this is the bride coming of
[33:44] Christ. This is the omega coming back to
[33:49] the alpha. So this is very exciting to
[33:52] see this. And brother Brennan explains
[33:56] some of this as we listen to him preach.
[34:00] And I love to hear the way he preaches
[34:04] his mannerisms,
[34:06] how he goes to the scripture. He always
[34:08] prophets always go back to the scripture
[34:11] because the word of God is our absolute.
[34:15] Amen. Some people have said, "Well,
[34:17] brother Brennham's our absolute." No,
[34:19] no, I beg to differ with you. The reason
[34:21] that we can say that the prophet's
[34:24] message is our absolute is because he
[34:27] made the word of God his absolute.
[34:30] That's right.
[34:32] See, he would never allow you to even
[34:34] say, "Well, that could be the 23rd uh
[34:37] chapter of Revelation or the book of
[34:40] Acts." He said, "No, that'd be adding
[34:42] to." So, he took mysteries that are in
[34:45] there and he revealed. Let's stand
[34:47] together. We're going to read the
[34:49] scriptures. Turn with me if you would in
[34:52] Revelations 10 and verse 7. Probably one
[34:55] of our most familiar scriptures
[34:59] that we know. Revelations 10 and 7.
[35:06] But in the days of the voice of the
[35:08] seventh angel,
[35:10] when he should begin to sound, now
[35:13] brother Brennham said that word sound is
[35:16] to blast forth as a gospel trumpet. He
[35:20] says it comes from the uh Greek word
[35:23] salpo which actually means to blast
[35:26] forth as a uh a message, something going
[35:31] forth as a trumpet. Because remember,
[35:34] Israel always gathers with trumpets.
[35:36] Amen. God always does things like a
[35:39] trumpet. I turn to see a uh the the it
[35:43] was like a trumpet and he turns. You
[35:46] see, these are all symbols.
[35:48] So when he should begin to sound,
[35:50] brother Brenham said not when he starts
[35:52] his ministry, but when he begins to
[35:55] actually sound. So now, brother
[35:58] Brennham, may I use this terminology so
[36:01] you understand with the opening of the
[36:05] seven seals, which is the mystery of God
[36:08] being totally revealed. Prior to that,
[36:12] he probed at scriptures.
[36:15] He probed. He guessed, if you please, as
[36:20] an example, the white horse rider.
[36:24] Prior to that first seal, he said,
[36:26] "That's Christ riding down through the
[36:27] ages." With the opening of the the first
[36:30] seal, that angel meets him and breaks
[36:33] that opening of the seal. He said, "Oh,
[36:34] no. It's not Christ. Who is it? It's the
[36:36] Antichrist." Amen. So, you have to take
[36:39] the word in its season. So, now you see
[36:43] what God's doing.
[36:46] Understand this. He's circumcising the
[36:48] message. Amen. He's taken away all of
[36:51] carnal thoughts and now meeting with
[36:55] supernatural angels coming and and he
[36:59] says he is those seals. It is Christ
[37:04] being revealed.
[37:06] So we we see this is now something
[37:08] supernatural.
[37:10] So God is we we now we are have a
[37:15] message that brother Bram's not probing
[37:18] at it any longer.
[37:20] He says now we have thus sayeth the
[37:23] Lord. Amen. He even says hey you all
[37:26] know that I' I preach serpent seed and
[37:28] everything. He says with the opening of
[37:30] the seals now he says you have a
[37:33] complete vision of this now. It begins
[37:35] to have a complete understanding.
[37:37] Revelations 10:7 when he should begin to
[37:40] sound not when he starts his ministry.
[37:43] So now the prophet as Christ
[37:48] took the scripture of Isaiah found where
[37:52] it was written of him.
[37:55] Okay? And he said this day is this
[37:57] scripture being fulfilled. So now we
[38:00] have even brother Brennham coming and
[38:03] taking and prophesying
[38:06] and taking revelations 10 and 7 as 1-7
[38:12] when he preaches this the sermon serves
[38:15] as this the sign of the end what is the
[38:18] sign of the end revelations 10 1-7 amen
[38:21] what's this all about why these angels
[38:23] why all of this what is this all about
[38:26] so now God is bringing us into the
[38:29] fullness, the revealing of the word
[38:32] which is Christ himself. All right? When
[38:34] he should begin to sound,
[38:41] the mystery of God should be finished as
[38:44] he hath declared to his servants, the
[38:46] prophets. Amen. May God bless the
[38:50] reading of his word. You all may be
[38:51] seated. Tonight, we're taking sides with
[38:54] Jesus.
[38:56] Um, this is 1962
[38:59] 0601. If you want to follow along,
[39:02] perhaps you have a a tablet, a cell
[39:05] phone or whatever. We are going to put
[39:07] it on the overhead. And so listen to
[39:09] this. You want to know how Elijah
[39:11] preached? You want to know what it was
[39:13] like in the days of Elijah? Here it is.
[39:16] This is uh the word of God for this
[39:20] hour. We call it the message of the
[39:23] hour. Amen. We call it the voice of God
[39:26] in these last days. So now he's
[39:28] beginning to sound forth the very
[39:31] mysteries of God. And here he's
[39:33] explaining this transition period. God
[39:36] bless you as we listen to God's servant
[39:38] prophet, Brother Brena.
[39:48] A prophet stays back here till he stomps
[39:50] out into the hospital or wherever he's
[39:52] going. Thus sayeth the Lord and say and
[39:54] stomp back out again. No evangelist at
[39:57] all. He don't hold meetings and discuss
[40:00] things. He's got the word of the Lord
[40:02] for whoever he sent to. If he's sent to
[40:05] the White House, he stomps right up in
[40:06] front from the White House. Is thus
[40:08] sayeth the Lord.
[40:10] If it's to the governor of the state,
[40:12] whoever it is, it's thus sayaeth the
[40:14] Lord.
[40:16] He don't fool around with a group of
[40:17] churches trying to get them to come in
[40:19] and take the word and preach these
[40:21] things like evangelists. He's not an
[40:22] evangelist.
[40:24] So you see, brethren, that's the reason
[40:26] I don't call myself a prophet.
[40:28] I'm not even in the office of one. See,
[40:32] now you understand what I mean. Now
[40:34] there'd be a lot go on like that for a
[40:35] long time, but I hope to not take too
[40:37] much of your time until I get a little
[40:39] bit of this word I want to read tonight.
[40:41] Now, here's what I'm doing.
[40:45] I have never felt that I should live in
[40:48] Indiana.
[40:50] I'm a I'm a rambler.
[40:53] I don't I'll go one place I think I'll
[40:56] go over here and I'll settle down here.
[40:57] This is it. I can't do it. Want to go
[41:01] somewhere else. I think I'll go over
[41:02] here. Want to do it? My wife calls me
[41:06] what that song is saying about restless
[41:09] wind. You've heard it. I guess most all
[41:12] of you hear him saying, "Oh, that's why
[41:14] she calls me. Restless winds." About
[41:16] time I get here, I think, boy, I've just
[41:18] got to get home. I got to see the wife
[41:19] and kids. I just got to go to church
[41:21] once more and preach. I get here, come
[41:23] down, preach once, kiss my wife, and hug
[41:26] all the kids, get out the yard to cut
[41:27] the grass, and the airplane goes over. I
[41:30] stop, wipe the sweat off my face, and
[41:34] I want to go with him somewhere else. I
[41:37] got to go. Well, I think I got to go
[41:39] down there. And I I go down there. I
[41:41] preach there a while.
[41:44] Look around.
[41:46] There goes the other one over. I got to
[41:48] go with him. See, there's no settling
[41:50] down place for me. I just can't do it.
[41:53] Restless, shifting place to place.
[41:57] Something I can't help it. It's
[41:59] something in me and I know that I must
[42:03] do it. Now, if the church is in its
[42:06] present state,
[42:08] I'd feel horrible to walk away from here
[42:11] and think of all you men sitting here
[42:15] that I believe I'll spend an eternity
[42:17] with over glory land. We got fine man,
[42:21] fine material, solid, sound people. Just
[42:26] recently there's a revival broke out in
[42:28] the church here amongst the people. The
[42:30] spirit come among them begin to give
[42:32] gifts.
[42:34] I watched it to see if he go off into
[42:36] fanaticism. Every time he start moving
[42:38] that way, the spirit check, bring it
[42:40] back here. Praise the Lord. You just
[42:43] hold your place there. That's fine. See,
[42:46] now
[42:48] what my thoughts is is this is if it
[42:52] could be possible that when I start
[42:55] going somewhere,
[42:57] I don't know where I'm going. But I
[42:59] can't sit still. I ain't going to stay
[43:01] here.
[43:03] I just can't do it. I got to move
[43:06] somewhere.
[43:07] And I probably won't stay there, but a
[43:09] few days be moving somewhere else. I got
[43:12] to go somewhere. I don't know where I'm
[43:13] going. Neither did Abraham know where he
[43:16] was going. He just crossed the river and
[43:19] started off.
[43:21] That's all. I feel that what we ought to
[43:24] do here in this present time. I believe
[43:27] that we need a church. I think I think
[43:31] the house of God, you say, well, what
[43:34] put all that money in it if the Lord is
[43:36] going to come? Well, what good is going
[43:37] to do to keep the money if the Lord
[43:38] comes? If the people designated the
[43:41] money for the church, it's our duty with
[43:44] 100% vote ear talk that night to build
[43:47] the church. So build it. I'd say build
[43:49] it. Yes. I've never expressed this
[43:52] before, but I want to do it before you
[43:54] man. Didn't want the women here because
[43:55] one leans this way and that way. I'm
[43:57] trying to tell you the reason I want to
[43:59] do it. I think if the Lord's coming next
[44:01] week, let's start the church this week.
[44:04] Certainly. Let's show him. Let's stand
[44:06] at our post of duty. Yes, sir. And then
[44:09] if we uh when the church is built up why
[44:12] say if he's what if he's 10 years from
[44:13] now what if he's 20 years or what if
[44:15] he's 100 years whatever it is when he
[44:17] comes that matters not we know he'll be
[44:20] coming for us before that time because
[44:21] we can't live it out 100 years more
[44:24] you'll be coming for us but we got to
[44:26] leave partings behind us and I've
[44:29] thought this why not then let the church
[44:31] board you're speaking to them now build
[44:33] that church put it up here make it nice
[44:37] and a nice place the people can come.
[44:40] I'd suggest brother Neville be the
[44:42] pastor of the church as long as the
[44:44] church suggests him being pastor. That's
[44:46] the vote of the church. As long as he
[44:48] holds a post of duty and stays with the
[44:50] faith, wants to come, feels the leading
[44:52] of the Lord, then the leading of the
[44:54] Lord for him to stay. If the
[44:55] congregation votes the same, then I'd
[44:58] say each one of these men out here,
[44:59] these other men like brother Chris and
[45:02] brother Jr. all them. As long as they
[45:05] feel their duty at that post and they're
[45:08] associated here together, you can't go
[45:10] down and meet with the Methodist, you
[45:12] have no fellowship with them, the
[45:14] Baptist, you go talking about speaking
[45:17] in tongues in the baptism in Jesus name,
[45:19] they kick you out that quick. That's
[45:21] right. You sit around there, you'd be
[45:23] like a a dove amongst a bunch of crows.
[45:26] You would have no fellowship at all.
[45:28] You're d I ain't making fun of Methodist
[45:30] and Baptist. Now remember that. I'm not
[45:32] saying that. I'm just drawing a
[45:34] comparison. And many of those Methodists
[45:36] and Baptists are a good man, godly man.
[45:39] But I'm talking about the fellowship.
[45:41] There's brother, what's his name back
[45:43] there tonight? The evangelist sitting
[45:45] back there, brother JT Parnell. Brother
[45:48] Beer, believe it's brother sitting here.
[45:51] Some of many of you here, man of God
[45:54] calling in your life. You can be doing
[45:56] something. Just don't sit around. Let's
[45:59] do something. You don't get but one soul
[46:01] saved get that one saved.
[46:04] Each one of us. Now I think this church
[46:07] if you man would when you build this
[46:11] church make this like your headquarters
[46:13] and like brother Neville here being like
[46:16] the senior elder among you. See and
[46:19] sometimes you get a question that you
[46:21] can't discuss out with your church out
[46:24] there. then bring it in here to brother
[46:27] Neville and you all discuss it together.
[46:30] If you can't come to any decision, I'll
[46:32] be coming by pretty soon. Then we'll all
[46:35] come together with it and and then in
[46:37] there get training in your own groups,
[46:40] other ministers, man that you see that
[46:43] has a calling in their life for the
[46:45] ministry. Train them young man. Bring
[46:47] them in here to the elder. All of you
[46:49] set together in a ministerial meeting
[46:52] and there teach the deeper things of
[46:54] God. Don't go on the bad end. Keep
[46:57] someone who you can have confidence in
[47:00] to be kind of like a a leader for you.
[47:03] And then sometimes if you don't see it
[47:05] just exactly the way he does, go that's
[47:07] all right. You're in the faith anyhow.
[47:09] Just move along. Maybe when we come
[47:11] together then all of us together we are
[47:12] pray the discernment of God come down
[47:14] and he'll give it just exactly what it
[47:16] is. You see? and let us know just how to
[47:18] do it and in there churches can go here
[47:21] and training up a group of men and if
[47:23] I'm in evangelistic work somewhere
[47:25] there's places I can place them
[47:27] worldwide
[47:29] what if I was in India go back to India
[47:32] there I'd say to these people maybe
[47:35] you'd have thousands of them stay there
[47:36] for a week or two and they see the
[47:38] ministry they love it they believe it's
[47:40] a truth they come out of heathenism
[47:42] there I've got and maybe in two or three
[47:44] weeks when I was only there two nights
[47:46] and maybe 100,000 converted to Christ,
[47:49] nowhere to go the next day, take a plane
[47:51] and start back to Rome, then to the
[47:54] United States, leave them just like
[47:56] sheep put out among wolves. What if I
[47:59] had a group of men, young man, trained
[48:02] in a message?
[48:04] Okay, just say now wait a minute. Before
[48:08] I leave here, we're going to set in
[48:12] order these churches. I'll have a man
[48:14] that already telegram him. They got the
[48:16] money. They're on the road here right
[48:18] now to take over this. A good man is two
[48:23] or three young men with him who will be
[48:25] his helpers and assistants and a church
[48:28] of this faith can be set there which
[48:30] will be a outpost in India, outpost in
[48:34] Germany, outpost in Switzerland while
[48:37] right now we should had them all around
[48:39] the nation. It's where I've been. Amen.
[48:42] And the message then from there comes
[48:44] another from another comes another. See
[48:46] what I mean? Now
[48:49] tomorrow night or day after tomorrow
[48:51] night you'll see Max and Bo come down
[48:53] here which is my friend. You'll see just
[48:55] what one little crippled up Swede
[49:00] did over there and Tanzanica.
[49:04] He went in there and I met some Bose is
[49:07] a good man but he don't believe the
[49:09] faith that we believe.
[49:11] I tuck him out and tuck him and just
[49:13] tied him to such a place in the
[49:15] scripture. I say, "Matson, you're my
[49:16] friend. Now you're not going to jump or
[49:18] run. We're just going to stand here and
[49:19] hold one of those hands as Christian
[49:21] brothers and talk." See? And lay the
[49:23] message right to him. And he just sat
[49:24] there. He said, "Brew Brandom, you you
[49:27] sure are right." I said, "Now Madison,
[49:29] you don't believe that or you'd accept
[49:30] it." Well, Random, I believe what you
[49:33] say is the truth. Then why don't you
[49:34] accept it? See, just burn it right down
[49:36] to him and he then as soon as he gets
[49:38] away, he's gone.
[49:40] See, but just watch what that man did in
[49:44] his missions over there. Just one man.
[49:47] Course he can send right back to Chicago
[49:49] and pick up Burton and all the rest of
[49:50] them. Send them over in there like that
[49:52] and start to work doing to now they're
[49:53] getting up into the tens of thousands
[49:56] of one little revival. Not a man with
[50:00] gifts, just a man who had enough courage
[50:02] to go there and start.
[50:05] What could have been done under this?
[50:09] have been ranking in the millions.
[50:12] Sure, we've lost that time. That's what
[50:15] my suggestion would be. Now, remember,
[50:18] in doing this, you'll find out there may
[50:21] be times that you'll disagree with
[50:23] brother so and so, you'll disagree over
[50:25] here. And remember, as long as you get
[50:27] to the spot you say, "Well, because he
[50:29] don't believe it just like me, I'm going
[50:31] to then there's something wrong with
[50:33] you.
[50:35] There's not wrong with the other fella.
[50:36] It's something wrong with you." When
[50:38] brethren who are trying to hold together
[50:41] is one thing we Brandoms is nine of us
[50:45] and we fight like pet dogs
[50:49] but after all when we got through
[50:51] fighting we were still Brandoms.
[50:54] One the other was a Brandon. I know he
[50:55] was a Brandon. He know I was a brand.
[50:57] See but we'd fight. You do that in your
[50:59] family but they're still your brothers.
[51:02] That's the way it is. We might
[51:03] different. That's all right. But we're
[51:06] still one.
[51:08] We're one in Christ. We believe this
[51:09] message and let's stay with it. And I
[51:11] think that's the thing to do to keep on
[51:13] carrying on until Jesus comes. And
[51:16] that's what I wanted to say in that
[51:18] manner. And I believe if you'd have like
[51:21] see, you've got to be enthused with it.
[51:24] If you're not enthused, then it's
[51:26] something wrong.
[51:28] There's something wrong. You've got just
[51:30] not say, well, last month I was pretty
[51:32] well enthused, but I don't know. See,
[51:35] then there's something wrong somewhere.
[51:36] You got to be enthused all the time.
[51:39] See, and just keep punching. It's the
[51:41] devil trying to get you. Like I always
[51:44] liked uh our last president, Mr.
[51:47] Eisenhower. Uh I had a great admiration
[51:50] for uh General Eisenhower.
[51:54] Uh he said when we were fighting, he
[51:57] said there's many times we picked up a
[51:59] shell and throw it into the gun and
[52:01] pulled a hammer on it and let her fall
[52:02] and it snapped. It didn't go off. said
[52:05] we didn't surrender, said we might have
[52:08] put in another one and it snapped, too.
[52:10] Said we didn't give up. Said we kept on
[52:13] snapping till the one went off.
[52:15] That's it. That's the way to win the
[52:17] war.
[52:18] Keep trying. Throw a shell in and pull
[52:21] it.
[52:22] You got a purpose, a target to hit. And
[52:25] if it don't go off, throw it out. Throw
[52:27] another one in and try it again. Throw
[52:29] it in and try it again till one goes
[52:31] off. There's one of them in there. It's
[52:33] alive.
[52:35] One of them will go off. But that's what
[52:37] we got to do. Just keep firing away,
[52:40] firing away until something happened.
[52:44] What am I doing?
[52:46] I'm firing away now. I'm going out here
[52:49] and I know him out in your leading, a
[52:52] responsibility.
[52:54] Millions of people looking at you. What
[52:56] you going to do? What's the next move?
[52:58] Some thinks I'm dead. Some thinks this.
[53:00] Even that gun when all said I was trying
[53:02] to commit suicide. Everything. out
[53:04] around the country and everything.
[53:06] See, but you got all that to contend
[53:08] with, man. You got the burden of the
[53:11] people. And just imagine what if God
[53:13] would place on you that you know the
[53:15] heart of the people that you're talking
[53:16] to. Think about that.
[53:20] See,
[53:22] brother, maybe I know you have burdens,
[53:25] but you don't understand. And besides
[53:27] that, here you've got the responsibility
[53:30] here. You say, "Well, that ought to be
[53:31] easy for you, brother Bram. anything to
[53:33] do. God just tell you, "No, he doesn't.
[53:35] I sweat it out just like you do and a
[53:37] whole lot harder."
[53:39] Sure, I have to sweat it much harder
[53:42] than you do. And there's going to be
[53:44] more required of me where you have to
[53:46] answer for a church where you have to
[53:48] answer for your family or maybe just for
[53:50] yourself. See, there's millions of souls
[53:52] I got to answer for. I got to know my
[53:55] moves. And if Satan's knocking you for
[53:58] one soul or a few souls that you'll
[54:00] catch, what about out here where
[54:01] millions are setting in order? How many
[54:03] more blast is he throwing in there? See,
[54:06] so you got a whole lot to remember,
[54:08] brother. That no wonder I get nervous
[54:10] sometimes. Sure. But now I'm punching
[54:15] away right now. I throw a shell in it
[54:17] that fires. There it is. If it don't
[54:20] fire, I won't quit. I'll throw that one
[54:23] out as a thud and try another one. One
[54:25] of them's going to go off. That's all
[54:27] there is to it. One of them's going to
[54:29] fire somewhere. Then I'll I want to be
[54:31] on the target. So when it does fire,
[54:34] I'll hit the object that I'm shooting
[54:35] at. And I you know what I mean? I'm sure
[54:38] there's something somewhere. I'm leaving
[54:40] for these meetings. Just plunging out. I
[54:43] don't aim to teach these great things I
[54:46] teach you people. You remember what that
[54:49] dream that I got the interpretation was?
[54:51] go back and store up food.
[54:55] Where was the storehouse? This
[54:57] tabernacle.
[54:59] Where is there anything like it in the
[55:01] country around here anywhere that will
[55:03] compare with the message that we have?
[55:05] Now, of course, our little brother is
[55:07] sure that that's along here. These other
[55:08] little churches are us.
[55:10] We're one. Where would you go to to find
[55:13] it? Shorts comparison anywhere.
[55:17] You go right out in denominational
[55:19] creed, you'll go right out away from the
[55:20] name of the Lord Jesus. You'll go right
[55:22] out away from these other things. See,
[55:24] here's where the food's been stored up.
[55:27] Well, one message that I preach here to
[55:29] you all, look, I've been preaching from
[55:30] one to six hours to you on a message.
[55:33] Well, if I had to use one of those
[55:35] message, I'd take a week to take it.
[55:36] Just a little bit here and a little bit
[55:37] there. See, because it's been stored up
[55:40] here. It's on tapes. It'll go worldwide
[55:42] on the tapes where people in their
[55:44] houses. them tapes will fall right into
[55:46] the hands of the predestinated of God.
[55:49] He can direct the word. He'll direct
[55:50] everything just exactly to its course.
[55:52] That's the reason he sent me back to do
[55:54] this. Store up the food here. He forbid
[55:57] me to go overseas. Brother Argite said,
[56:00] "Well, come and go. You got one night,
[56:02] but we'll take you a tour trip all
[56:03] around the country." The way I seen
[56:05] Brother Fred and Brother Banks trying to
[56:07] go. I said, "I wouldn't go that way."
[56:10] See, it showed that there was something
[56:12] else. I pressed right up to the mark
[56:16] now, but I don't know which way to go,
[56:18] but these amination land all around me.
[56:21] Did he call me back to the evangelism?
[56:24] Has he called me to foreign
[56:25] missionaries? Has he called me to be his
[56:27] prophet? I'm at a pastor somewhere.
[56:29] Whatever I'm to do, I'll just keep
[56:31] throwing shell in and pulling a hammer
[56:33] on. One of them will go off.
[56:36] But I'm just not going to stay and look
[56:38] say, "Lord, you put the shell in the
[56:39] gun. I'm going to put the shell in the
[56:40] gun. Do the pulling myself. Let him do
[56:43] the fine. He's the one to take care of
[56:45] that. Let me just keep moving on. I I go
[56:48] on this meeting now. I'm just going out.
[56:50] I don't know. I I may not say one thing
[56:53] about these message like a preacher. I
[56:56] may not even have one night of
[56:58] discernment. I don't know. I'm just
[57:00] going not knowing what I'm going to do.
[57:02] I couldn't tell you. I'm just going. And
[57:05] that's all. And that's what you have to
[57:07] do.
[57:09] You got something in mind. The people
[57:11] here wants a church. Build it as quick
[57:14] as you can. Get it up. Get your teachers
[57:17] and names. You brother out and your
[57:19] little churches and you want to you're
[57:22] doing a work. God will reward you for
[57:24] that. Go out there, preach. Do
[57:26] everything you can. Let all of you get
[57:28] together. You bunch of men and have
[57:30] meetings and talk on deep things of the
[57:32] scripture and pray. Don't don't just
[57:36] come here together unless you come for
[57:37] prayer meeting alone. do your praying in
[57:40] secret. Stay out in a place and go into
[57:42] your rooms. Hide out somewhere and just
[57:45] kneel down and just stay before God and
[57:47] stay there. Then if you find out look
[57:49] like something's moving up or you're
[57:51] just going and you find out it gets a
[57:53] little bit off the word and be careful.
[57:57] No matter how good it looks, stop right
[57:59] there. A wrong spirit struck you because
[58:02] the message of this day is to the word.
[58:05] Okay. Don't see if you say, "Oh my
[58:07] brother, I tell you so and so, while so
[58:10] and so stood the other night, this thing
[58:11] take place like this." Watch it.
[58:14] Watch it close. Don't renounce nothing.
[58:17] Just wait and see how it acts and then
[58:20] bring it up to the word and see how it
[58:22] compares with the word. Then if it
[58:23] compares with the word and everything's
[58:25] fine, thank God and just keep moving on
[58:27] and see this long as it stays in the
[58:29] word. That's my opinion. What I think
[58:32] you should do, brother Neville, brother
[58:34] Ruddle, and Brother Crease, and Brother
[58:37] Beer, and all you brother, Juny,
[58:39] wherever you are, and the rest of you,
[58:41] brother, God richly bless you. I see
[58:45] Terry, Lynn, Charlie Cox, David,
[58:51] a lot of you young men here, God anoint
[58:54] you. Amen.
[58:57] My how would like to pick up a handful
[59:00] of you via evangelism and set you
[59:02] somewhere. See, knowing that you've come
[59:04] up, you can stand and know the message
[59:07] and study to prove yourself. You feel a
[59:10] call in your life. I see two or three
[59:12] young men, four or five sitting on the
[59:14] row back here and and like that. You're
[59:18] a young man. I'm getting old. Brother
[59:20] Neville's getting old. We're middle-aged
[59:22] man. If time rolls on, we're going to
[59:25] walk off the scene.
[59:26] You've got to fill our shoes. See? And
[59:30] so you seeing that maybe in that day
[59:33] even it'll be growing greater if there
[59:35] is a tomorrow. But while there is a
[59:37] today, let's work wise today. Tomorrow
[59:39] may never come. If it does, let's be
[59:41] ready for it. See what I mean? Now
[59:44] that's what I would think to you. Would
[59:47] it be wonderful to see a brother up
[59:50] there from Utica,
[59:53] brother Grace, all you other brethren
[59:56] here come together, meet, come into a
[59:59] place, you minister, set together and
[1:00:02] discuss things. You've got to have
[1:00:04] fellowship somewhere. You've got to have
[1:00:06] something to come together to kind of
[1:00:08] get together about. You all come
[1:00:10] together as a group of men and believe
[1:00:11] one with the other and like that and
[1:00:13] discuss these problems and set out maybe
[1:00:16] once a month just ministers alone let
[1:00:18] you meet somewhere in one of your
[1:00:20] churches sit there and discuss it and
[1:00:22] talk it each one of you pastors and
[1:00:24] evangelists and whatever you are and
[1:00:26] then if some great problem comes up you
[1:00:28] can't settle then if I'm called on the
[1:00:30] field of evangelism I don't know that I
[1:00:32] will be if I will be you know I'll be
[1:00:34] coming back constantly all the time and
[1:00:36] then if you get those things down when I
[1:00:38] come back here or we'll meet together
[1:00:41] and just stay down there. One of you has
[1:00:42] a calling in your life. We won't have
[1:00:45] like private interviews and things we've
[1:00:46] been having. We'll just come right
[1:00:48] together and stay there till we have
[1:00:49] thus sayeth the Lord. And if you can get
[1:00:52] the preacher straight and him going,
[1:00:54] right? Look what he's going to do. He's
[1:00:56] going to influence us, it would take
[1:00:57] care of the hundreds of these things
[1:00:59] that we're just beating at. You see, you
[1:01:02] got to get it a system, God's system.
[1:01:05] like uh Jethro said to Moses, "Well, you
[1:01:09] can't beat out all of them." Or, "And
[1:01:11] God put elders out there, 70 of them,
[1:01:15] and tuck the spirit was on Moses and put
[1:01:18] them up on those 70 elders, and they
[1:01:21] prophesied." And it didn't weaken Moses
[1:01:23] a bit and strengthened him. He had just
[1:01:26] as much prophecy in him as he did before
[1:01:28] they took the spirit off of him that
[1:01:29] prophesied. See, he just separated the
[1:01:31] son of Moses. let them judge the smaller
[1:01:34] things. And but when it comes to the
[1:01:36] major things, you come in with them and
[1:01:38] help them like that. That's the way that
[1:01:40] was God's way back there. That was God's
[1:01:42] way in the in the early church age. And
[1:01:45] I believe it's God's way now.
[1:01:48] Right. For us to do it. So let's do it.
[1:01:51] Just quit talking about it and do it.
[1:01:54] That's all we can do it by the grace of
[1:01:56] God. Don't you believe it?
[1:01:58] I Let's see. Oh, don't tuck my time up.
[1:02:02] But u Billy wrote a note here just may
[1:02:04] not see what it is. I'm from New Albany.
[1:02:09] Daughter of Grace Memorial Hospital
[1:02:11] broke her arm. Uh
[1:02:14] uh wants prayer for her. T R O U B WC
[1:02:19] Trobe Trobe something like that. Let's
[1:02:21] have prayer for this young lady. our
[1:02:24] heavenly father
[1:02:26] as we're speaking now
[1:02:29] and I'm thinking it maybe when Irenous
[1:02:34] looked out upon his little group of men
[1:02:38] it perhaps is a lot smaller group than
[1:02:40] here tonight
[1:02:42] and they didn't have a seat to set him
[1:02:45] they sat on old coal slabs
[1:02:50] of rock
[1:02:52] and they sat there and he talked to
[1:02:54] them. Those men went out even when to
[1:02:58] go. They know that they could be fed to
[1:03:00] lions, their heads chopped off.
[1:03:04] But the faith of our fathers are living
[1:03:05] still in spite of dungeon flame and
[1:03:09] sword.
[1:03:10] I thank you for these men, Lord. I pray
[1:03:13] that you'll bless them. Now I bless each
[1:03:15] of them in thy name. That you will keep
[1:03:18] them in the faith that was once
[1:03:20] delivered to the saints. that never will
[1:03:22] they vary from that. And out of this
[1:03:24] group, may you send pastors, teachers,
[1:03:26] evangelists, oh God, Brandon, and may
[1:03:29] they hold a fort
[1:03:31] everywhere, wherever they are. May they
[1:03:34] continually work until Jesus comes. And
[1:03:39] now, Father, I pray for each of these
[1:03:41] requests that's coming here tonight. And
[1:03:44] I ask that you'll remember
[1:03:48] this little lady down here that just
[1:03:49] broke her arm. May the power of Almighty
[1:03:53] God heal her and make her well. Grant
[1:03:56] it, Lord. I pray that you'll help her
[1:03:59] and bless her. Bless her loved ones for
[1:04:02] calling. And may the power that raised
[1:04:04] up Jesus out of the grave raise up this
[1:04:07] girl. May her arm get well. All these
[1:04:10] requests that was made mentioned tonight
[1:04:12] that poor boy laying there it's got this
[1:04:16] I heard the brother announce it that the
[1:04:19] Hajeson's disease has eat through him
[1:04:21] until his face is burn up with radium
[1:04:24] and things are given. God be merciful to
[1:04:26] that boy. Let him live. We think of that
[1:04:29] man that didn't prepare to meet you and
[1:04:31] gone on now. His wife with a crushed
[1:04:33] head adopted child. All these others
[1:04:37] sister Bruce packing that water. She's
[1:04:39] getting old, Father. And there she burn
[1:04:41] her arms and up and down her body. We
[1:04:44] pray for her. She's probably
[1:04:45] hospitalized. And we pray that you'll
[1:04:47] deliver her and bring her out. Granted,
[1:04:50] Father, we ask these blessings in the
[1:04:52] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:04:56] Now, I want to ask you something
[1:04:59] and um ask you if um
[1:05:02] if
[1:05:04] you believe that we have time just for a
[1:05:07] little bit of the word. Do you have it?
[1:05:09] just for now it's I know it's a little
[1:05:11] late but I had a little something here
[1:05:13] that I thought out today that I would
[1:05:15] like to to
[1:05:18] speak on just for a minute and it might
[1:05:20] help you and I thought first that I
[1:05:24] would announce this now it's on this
[1:05:27] tape and if anybody would ever want to
[1:05:30] refer to it Jim H thing to what I think
[1:05:34] ought to be done and now what should be
[1:05:37] done to the for you brethren. Now, do
[1:05:41] you know when those early men went out
[1:05:44] sometimes there were only about six or
[1:05:46] eight of them together and they shook
[1:05:49] the country.
[1:05:52] What do you know when Aquilla and
[1:05:53] Priscilla that great revival that
[1:05:56] Apollos was having over there, there's
[1:05:57] only about six or eight men and women in
[1:05:59] that bunch.
[1:06:01] That whole church meant six or eight.
[1:06:04] You got five or six, seven times as many
[1:06:07] here tonight as they had that. You know,
[1:06:10] Jesus only had 12 apostles.
[1:06:13] We always think it for something big,
[1:06:15] but God don't deal in them big numbers.
[1:06:18] It's in these little groups is where he
[1:06:20] gets in. Look all down through the
[1:06:22] agent. Anytime he ever met with man, it
[1:06:24] was in small groups. See, and spoke with
[1:06:27] them and ordained them. It's God's good
[1:06:30] pleasure to do that. That's the way he
[1:06:32] likes to do it. And now we just want to
[1:06:35] keep God in our midst and go do these
[1:06:37] things. Now, Sunday morning,
[1:06:40] Lord willing, I want to speak to you on
[1:06:42] evening time evangelism. And then I'll,
[1:06:46] if the Lord permits, I'll probably be
[1:06:48] leaving until late this fall and uh
[1:06:51] before I get back again. I'll probably
[1:06:53] get back sometime in around in
[1:06:55] September. And now I'm hoping, but then
[1:06:59] that everything will move wonderfully
[1:07:01] for you, brethren. and your meetings
[1:07:03] will grow and numbers and the grace of
[1:07:05] God be upon you all and until we meet
[1:07:09] and I'm trusting that you'll pray for me
[1:07:12] and the success remember it your prayers
[1:07:17] for me
[1:07:18] that means you're my colleague you're
[1:07:21] you're my buddy my helper and together
[1:07:24] we are helpers in the Lord and I when
[1:07:26] I'm standing out there before the enemy
[1:07:29] I I want to remember that faithful true
[1:07:32] soul soldiers that gets prayer answered
[1:07:34] for the sick and the afflicted and those
[1:07:36] men are praying for me. I'm the one who
[1:07:40] needs it out there. I'm really need it.
[1:07:43] So you all pray for me when you gather.
[1:07:45] Don't forget me in any meeting. Pray for
[1:07:47] me. Now in St. John the 9th chapter, I
[1:07:51] want to read from the 26th verse until
[1:07:54] the 35th. Now just for a few minutes and
[1:07:58] then we'll we'll close in the next 20 or
[1:08:01] 30 minutes or maybe before that time the
[1:08:03] Lord willing. Now I want to read these
[1:08:05] scriptures now from St. John 26 to uh
[1:08:09] St. John 10 9 uh 26-35 I've got wrote
[1:08:14] down here just something I was thinking
[1:08:16] of. Then said they unto him again what
[1:08:21] did he do to thee?
[1:08:25] How open he thine eyes?
[1:08:28] And he answered them, I have told you
[1:08:31] already, and you did not hear. Wherefore
[1:08:35] would you hear again?
[1:08:38] Will you also be his disciples?
[1:08:42] Then they reviled him and said, "Thou
[1:08:46] art his disciples, but we are Moses'
[1:08:49] disciples. We know that God spake unto
[1:08:52] Moses, but for this fellow we know not
[1:08:56] from whence he is.
[1:08:59] The man answered and said unto them,
[1:09:03] Why, herein is a marvelous thing, that
[1:09:07] you know not from whence he is, and yet
[1:09:10] he has opened mine eyes.
[1:09:13] Now we know that God heareth not
[1:09:15] sinners. But if any man be a worshshiper
[1:09:18] of God,
[1:09:21] and doeth his will, him he heareth.
[1:09:25] Since the world began, has it not heard
[1:09:30] that any man has opened the eyes of one
[1:09:32] that was born blind? If this man were
[1:09:35] not of God, he could do nothing. Then
[1:09:40] answered,
[1:09:41] they answered and said unto him,
[1:09:45] Thou was altogether born in sin, and
[1:09:49] does thou teach us? And they cast him
[1:09:53] out.
[1:09:54] And Jesus heard that they had cast him
[1:09:56] out.
[1:09:58] And when he had found him, he said unto
[1:10:00] him, thou believe on the Son of God.
[1:10:06] Now
[1:10:08] I'd like to speak just for a few minutes
[1:10:11] to you brethren knowing that my little
[1:10:13] talk here I don't know what will become
[1:10:16] of it trusting that God will use it in
[1:10:18] some way and now in this upon his word
[1:10:21] so I know that brother saint brother
[1:10:23] Neville or one of you ministers usually
[1:10:25] preach and just being here with you uh
[1:10:28] if you'll pardon me I just like to speak
[1:10:30] to you a little bit on this matter now I
[1:10:32] want to take a subject here of taking
[1:10:35] sides with Jesus.
[1:10:38] The Pharisees
[1:10:40] and leaders of his day always tried to
[1:10:44] belittle him before the people.
[1:10:48] That was just a way that the devil had a
[1:10:53] working.
[1:10:55] All the Pharisees and the teachers of
[1:10:58] his day constantly tried to belittle
[1:11:03] Jesus.
[1:11:05] They all the throw off that they could
[1:11:07] give to him, they done it. They watched
[1:11:11] him constantly to find where they could
[1:11:14] find a fault. And they never spoke of
[1:11:16] his good things. They were always
[1:11:19] finding something that they could
[1:11:21] belittle him about and say, "You see,
[1:11:24] look here. If he was a man of God, he
[1:11:26] wouldn't do it this way. Or if he was a
[1:11:29] man of God, he wouldn't do it that way."
[1:11:32] They were trying to cast the shadow upon
[1:11:35] him to get the people to disbelieve him.
[1:11:40] That's the work of the devil.
[1:11:43] And that old scheme has never ceased.
[1:11:47] There's many times that a minister will
[1:11:49] make a mistake.
[1:11:51] And if he comes into a neighborhood, a
[1:11:53] precious brother who's trying to do
[1:11:55] what's right and to lead the people
[1:11:57] right, everything that the devil can
[1:12:00] point to the unbeliever or the so-called
[1:12:04] Christian in that neighborhood to throw
[1:12:06] off on that man, he'll do it. You know,
[1:12:09] the real Christian way is to hide
[1:12:11] everything you can from a brother. Amen.
[1:12:14] Don't tell his bad things. Just tell his
[1:12:16] good things. Just tell what you know
[1:12:18] about him is good. If anything's bad,
[1:12:20] let it alone. Poor fella's got enough
[1:12:22] against him anyhow. Don't try to take a
[1:12:25] pole and shove a man further into the
[1:12:28] ditch. The Christian attitude is pick
[1:12:30] him up and take him out of the ditch.
[1:12:32] Don't never try to shove him down. He's
[1:12:34] down already. Try to help him up. And
[1:12:38] but too many of us today, too many
[1:12:40] people today, I might say, try to do
[1:12:43] that, if they could just get something
[1:12:46] another that they could say that was
[1:12:48] real bad. Now, for instance, if if one
[1:12:52] of you brethren make a mistake and do
[1:12:54] something's wrong, which you're subject
[1:12:56] to do it, I am to every one of us. But
[1:13:01] as we go along, let's remember we are
[1:13:03] brothers.
[1:13:05] We are brothers. And if we got any
[1:13:07] fighting, let's fight with one another.
[1:13:09] Bring it together. Bring it before our
[1:13:11] brethren and settle it. Now, they used
[1:13:14] to in the Brandon family, if one of the
[1:13:15] little ones done something, just go tell
[1:13:17] Bill about it cuz I was the bigot. And I
[1:13:19] had to stand there and see which was
[1:13:21] right and wrong. Well, my decision was
[1:13:24] that if they uh which one was right and
[1:13:27] wrong. If they still didn't believe it,
[1:13:28] then they got around behind my back and
[1:13:30] fought it out. But they were still
[1:13:32] brothers. You see, they'd fight in the
[1:13:34] backyard with one another and fight in
[1:13:36] the front yard for one another. So
[1:13:38] that's the way it was. See, and it we're
[1:13:40] still brothers. Well, that that's the
[1:13:42] way we we got to do this. See, and if
[1:13:45] you got something against somebody, you
[1:13:47] a brother, don't tell somebody else
[1:13:48] about it. If it's wrong, go to him and
[1:13:50] tell him.
[1:13:53] And then if he's going to argue with
[1:13:55] you, then take somebody else with you.
[1:13:57] That's right. Then bring it up the way
[1:13:58] the Bible said. But Jesus,
[1:14:02] they they just tried to find every
[1:14:05] little shadow that they could find to
[1:14:08] try to belittle him in the sight of the
[1:14:11] people. And that's what the devil wants.
[1:14:14] They want to they want to hurt your
[1:14:17] influence before the people. That's why
[1:14:20] you want to watch careful what you do.
[1:14:22] Walk like real man of God. Talk like man
[1:14:25] of God. See, act like man of God. Live
[1:14:28] like man of God. Because a devil, your
[1:14:31] adversary, is going about like a roaring
[1:14:32] lion trying to devour what he can.
[1:14:36] Why did they do this? They were jealous
[1:14:39] of him. That was what's the reason they
[1:14:41] tried to belittle him. They were jealous
[1:14:44] of his ministry.
[1:14:46] And that's the reason they were trying
[1:14:47] to belittle. But he had the ministry of
[1:14:50] God. And they knew that, but it was
[1:14:52] contrary to their creed. So they were
[1:14:54] trying to belittle him. make everything
[1:14:57] every little flaw that they could find.
[1:14:58] Get him out of the way. They wanted him
[1:15:01] to quit. They wanted the people to
[1:15:02] denounce him. They wanted to say, "Now,
[1:15:05] uh, this guy's nothing. Look here." Now,
[1:15:08] there he just he he did this and you
[1:15:10] know that's not right. We've been taught
[1:15:12] all of our life that we should believe
[1:15:13] the elders and here he just stood right
[1:15:15] there and bought that elder out. He
[1:15:18] disagreed with the tradition of the
[1:15:19] fathers and we've been we are to believe
[1:15:21] the tradition of our fathers. We've been
[1:15:23] taught that by each rabbi all the years
[1:15:25] through. And here this man comes around
[1:15:27] and disagrees with him. See, while the
[1:15:30] man like that ain't fit to be a
[1:15:31] preacher. See, they were trying to
[1:15:34] belittle him. But in all of that, the
[1:15:38] ones that believed him and loved him and
[1:15:41] had seen his scriptural miracle signs
[1:15:45] would not be hindered by them. Amen.
[1:15:49] No, sir. Them who believed him believed
[1:15:51] him. Amen. Those who loved him stood by
[1:15:54] him. They would not see what others
[1:15:58] pointed out to him. Amen. Oh, if we
[1:16:01] could do that, if we could just not see
[1:16:04] if somebody turn around here and say,
[1:16:06] "You know what? They say you're a
[1:16:08] Pentecostal, not by denomination." Well,
[1:16:10] you was the you you're the kind that
[1:16:12] baptizes in Jesus name. Yeah, that's
[1:16:14] right. Well, let me tell you something.
[1:16:16] I know a man one time was baptized like
[1:16:17] that and he did so and so, but look, he
[1:16:20] that has nothing to do with it. It's a
[1:16:22] devil trying to throw a shadow on you.
[1:16:25] They're always trying to point you to
[1:16:26] some old ship that got wrecked up on the
[1:16:29] seashore, but they're not pointing you
[1:16:31] to that one that made the void safely.
[1:16:33] That's right. That's right. They're
[1:16:35] always trying to throw a crowbait out
[1:16:38] there and say, "This is example. Here's
[1:16:40] what did it." Uh, I know a certain
[1:16:42] preacher that was a holiness preacher
[1:16:44] and he did this, that, and the other.
[1:16:46] But they don't point out others that
[1:16:48] wasn't a holiness did that also, you
[1:16:50] see. And they don't part the great
[1:16:52] things that God did. Like somebody say,
[1:16:54] "Oh, here this man went too far. He He
[1:16:57] went too far. He might have done that.
[1:16:59] He wrecked himself up. He went too far.
[1:17:01] He become a fanatic. He might have done
[1:17:03] that." But while they're pointing to how
[1:17:06] many that went one that went too far,
[1:17:08] how about these millions that never went
[1:17:09] far enough?
[1:17:11] They fail to see that. You know what I
[1:17:14] mean? So the people tried, them
[1:17:18] Pharisees and Sadducees and hypocrites
[1:17:21] and Herodians and all tried to cast the
[1:17:24] shadow on Jesus. But them true believers
[1:17:28] that was predestinated to hear that
[1:17:31] message heard it and see no fault in it
[1:17:34] at all. Amen. That's right. Same now.
[1:17:38] Those who believe him love him. Those
[1:17:41] who believe him see no fault in him.
[1:17:43] Amen. They don't see any heresy. They
[1:17:45] don't see anything wrong. They don't see
[1:17:47] anything wrong with his word. They don't
[1:17:48] see anything wrong with these people.
[1:17:50] They just see Jesus and that's all. They
[1:17:53] they're they're predestinated eternal
[1:17:55] life. So, they just take sides with
[1:17:57] Jesus and stay there. Amen. We used to
[1:18:00] write sing a little song. Brother Roy uh
[1:18:02] Roersonson, we used to sing a little
[1:18:04] song here. I guess time you come here. I
[1:18:07] take the way with the Lord's despised
[1:18:09] you. I started in with Jesus and I'm
[1:18:12] going through. I'd rather walk with
[1:18:15] Jesus alone and half are my pillow like
[1:18:17] Jacob a stone.
[1:18:20] Well, you've heard the little song.
[1:18:22] That's right. I'd rather take the way of
[1:18:24] the discard.
[1:18:26] Take the way of the despised. Take the
[1:18:28] way of the talked about and walk with
[1:18:32] Jesus. See no fault in it at all. Don't
[1:18:36] see another fell's error. Just keep on
[1:18:39] going. That's all. Now, that's the way
[1:18:41] they did to Jesus. They didn't they
[1:18:43] didn't. And you must teach your people,
[1:18:45] you pastors to do the same. And if
[1:18:47] somebody comes along and says, uh, you
[1:18:49] know, uh, your church, they were so and
[1:18:50] so, they, yes, sir, they maybe a dozen
[1:18:53] of them sitting there then. But how
[1:18:54] about that one? It's it's it's all right
[1:18:56] sitting there. See, you're you're you're
[1:18:58] you just can't see the woods for the
[1:19:00] trees. That's all. That's it. Right back
[1:19:03] again. See? Um, and so they tried, they
[1:19:07] was not willing to admit that he was
[1:19:09] doing the work of God. So they were
[1:19:12] trying to so discord and get the people
[1:19:15] not to believe, but damn people who
[1:19:17] believe him stayed right with him. They
[1:19:18] took sight. You know, I thought your a
[1:19:22] couple of people I got wrote down here.
[1:19:24] The blind man would not be changed by
[1:19:27] them. That man, he just give his sight.
[1:19:30] We know the story. And um he gave them a
[1:19:33] very stinging question beside. Now they
[1:19:37] come up there and Jesus walked by and he
[1:19:40] was a man that was despised and hated.
[1:19:43] The Bible said he would be rejected. Uh
[1:19:46] there'd be no beauty of him. We should
[1:19:47] desire him. And all we like sheep have
[1:19:50] gone astray. He's a man of sorrow,
[1:19:52] acquainted with grief. And how all the
[1:19:55] Bible said what he would be. He'd be
[1:19:56] despised and rejected. And we see that
[1:20:00] man. Now those who believe the word,
[1:20:02] they know that the very things that
[1:20:04] Jesus was doing and the things was of
[1:20:06] his life, they knew who he was.
[1:20:09] So they couldn't put nothing light on
[1:20:11] him because they couldn't see it. Amen.
[1:20:15] And you know, love is blind anyhow for
[1:20:17] them. Love covers up a multitude of sin.
[1:20:20] You know, perfect love cast out fear and
[1:20:24] sin, all discord. Love does. Now this
[1:20:28] blind man was sitting there and Jesus
[1:20:30] and his disciples come by and I think
[1:20:33] Jesus gave them a little lesson here.
[1:20:35] When they seen this poor blind man they
[1:20:37] thought well now surely there's a sin
[1:20:39] behind that somewhere. When we see
[1:20:41] something happen to a man we always say
[1:20:44] well he's sin. He got out of the will of
[1:20:46] the Lord somewhere. Brother Chris hit
[1:20:48] the post. He got out of the will of the
[1:20:50] Lord somewhere. Somebody's idea. When
[1:20:52] the gun vote up on me well is out of the
[1:20:55] will of the Lord. Brother Neville hit
[1:20:57] the car is out of the will of the Lord.
[1:20:59] That's not exactly right. No, sir. It
[1:21:02] isn't. God permits those things. Jesus
[1:21:06] turned around and taught him a lesson.
[1:21:07] They said his father must have sinned or
[1:21:10] or did his mother sin or did he sin?
[1:21:12] Jesus said neither of them sin
[1:21:16] but that the works of God might be made
[1:21:19] manifest. Amen. See, God lets things
[1:21:22] happen just to for the works of God to
[1:21:24] be made manifest.
[1:21:26] Now, and so he said, told the man, and
[1:21:30] give him his sight, and he went his way,
[1:21:33] and here come the Pharisees up and
[1:21:34] heaven was rumored around. Here was a
[1:21:36] man is blind, sitting on there begging,
[1:21:38] and here it could see, and that were
[1:21:41] rumored around among them, and oh my,
[1:21:42] that stirred up something. And here they
[1:21:45] come up there and they see that the
[1:21:47] blind man could see. And first they went
[1:21:51] wanted to find some way to put a fear
[1:21:54] upon all the people because they had
[1:21:55] already said if anybody goes after this
[1:21:58] new doctrine, this new prophet called
[1:22:02] Jesus of Nazareth, immediately they'll
[1:22:04] be handed their paper and fellowship
[1:22:05] from the church. They cannot go to the
[1:22:07] synagogue no longer. If you associate
[1:22:09] with him, attend one of his meetings or
[1:22:11] anything, you can't go no more. So they
[1:22:14] want to make a big display out of it
[1:22:16] because they hated him. They wasn't
[1:22:18] thinking of that poor blind man, but
[1:22:21] they wanted to make a big display to
[1:22:23] make the people keep away from him. They
[1:22:25] said they want to ask his father and
[1:22:27] mother. So they went and got the father
[1:22:29] and mother. They said, "Is this your
[1:22:31] son?" He said, "Yes, sir." "Was he born
[1:22:33] blind?" "Yes, sir." "And uh what means
[1:22:37] does he see?" And the father and mother
[1:22:39] was afraid, the Bible said, because they
[1:22:41] know they'd be put out of the synagogue
[1:22:42] if they admitted that it was. And see
[1:22:44] there, they was taken down. They said,
[1:22:46] "Now we know this is our son." All
[1:22:49] probably a few thousand people stand
[1:22:51] there. But if he could if them stinking
[1:22:54] Pharisees could only put a blight on his
[1:22:57] name right there or done something to
[1:22:58] scare the people that are running out of
[1:23:00] there for that meeting. See? Amen. All
[1:23:02] his influence have been lost. So they
[1:23:05] said, uh, a bunch of them come up there
[1:23:06] with their priestly garments on and they
[1:23:09] said, uh, speak for him. They said, we
[1:23:12] know this is our son. We know he was
[1:23:14] born blind. But now how he sees I don't
[1:23:17] know. You asked him. He's of age.
[1:23:21] All right. So they went over and got
[1:23:23] him. Said, "Who give you your sight? How
[1:23:26] do you heal him?" He said, "Uh, one
[1:23:29] called Jesus of Nazareth, give me my
[1:23:31] sight." And they said, "Give praise to
[1:23:34] God." Said, "Well, we know this man's a
[1:23:37] sinner." Said, "Uh," and I said, "Which
[1:23:41] is he?" He said, "I don't know. He just
[1:23:43] come by and heal me." That's all I know
[1:23:46] about. I know one thing I do know. I
[1:23:49] couldn't tell you about him being a
[1:23:50] sinner or not. I don't know. I've just
[1:23:52] met the man today. But if if he could
[1:23:55] give me my my sight, I know this one
[1:23:58] thing that where I was once blind, I can
[1:24:00] now see. I'm sure of that. Where I was
[1:24:04] blind a half hour ago. And now I got
[1:24:07] just as good a sight as any of you fell.
[1:24:09] So I know I can see. Oh, what a stinger
[1:24:12] that put on me. So they thought why he
[1:24:15] said well I said do you all want to be
[1:24:16] his disciples too
[1:24:21] that's good that's good solid testimony
[1:24:25] that that that's good that's good
[1:24:27] backgrounds
[1:24:28] that that that's really good witnessing
[1:24:30] what I think said to you all here's a
[1:24:33] lay member a blind man standing on the
[1:24:35] street after meeting Jesus now asking
[1:24:37] the disciple asking the Pharisees if
[1:24:39] they want to be his disciples the
[1:24:41] bishops head man. You want to be his
[1:24:44] disciples also? They said, "Nay, you're
[1:24:48] his disciple. We're Moses disciple."
[1:24:51] Looking way back down through history,
[1:24:52] you know, we're Moses disciples.
[1:24:55] This man, we don't know nothing about
[1:24:57] him. We don't know where he come from or
[1:24:59] we haven't got a rule of any of our
[1:25:01] schools. He ever come up. He never come
[1:25:03] and ask us about these things.
[1:25:05] We don't know nothing about it. You
[1:25:07] people out there, you realize that man's
[1:25:09] not ordained.
[1:25:11] That man's a soothsayer or something.
[1:25:13] He's beyond.
[1:25:15] You're being bewitched. Well, he doesn't
[1:25:18] have any authority. We haven't given it
[1:25:20] to him yet. See, we don't even know
[1:25:22] which this man comes from. This old boy
[1:25:24] standing there conceived said. Now, this
[1:25:27] is a marvelous thing.
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:31] See, he's about to get the people beat
[1:25:33] down these Pharisees while make them
[1:25:34] afraid. See, but he had done sides with
[1:25:37] Jesus.
[1:25:39] So he said uh this is a marvelous thing.
[1:25:42] Let me break it down. Some of the words
[1:25:43] he might have said. Now you fellas
[1:25:46] around here has been running all the
[1:25:47] religious end of this for hundreds of
[1:25:49] years
[1:25:51] and uh you speak of a coming Messiah and
[1:25:55] something is going to take place just in
[1:25:57] the shadows of time when the deliverer
[1:26:00] is coming to see us. And you tell us
[1:26:02] that when he comes that that what all
[1:26:05] he's going to do in here. You the
[1:26:08] spiritual leaders, the high priest and
[1:26:11] priest of this community, standing here
[1:26:14] together before these people trying to
[1:26:17] blacken his name, trying to say
[1:26:19] something evil against him. And the man
[1:26:22] come and open my blinded eye.
[1:26:25] I was born blind. Here's my father and
[1:26:27] mother giving witness that I was born
[1:26:29] blind. Been sitting right here among you
[1:26:30] for all these years. Born blind. And
[1:26:33] that has never happened since the world
[1:26:35] began. Amen.
[1:26:38] And here a man can come and perform a
[1:26:40] miracle that hasn't been done since the
[1:26:43] world began. And you the spiritual
[1:26:45] leaders and don't know nothing about it.
[1:26:47] Amen.
[1:26:52] Now I say this is a marvelous thing.
[1:26:55] You tuck sides with Jesus.
[1:26:58] See, he was permitted to be blind so the
[1:27:02] works of God could be manifested. Amen.
[1:27:05] See, cuz he come on the side of the Lord
[1:27:08] Jesus. He took sides with him. Now he
[1:27:11] put a stinger to him. You know what they
[1:27:12] did? They said, "Now we know you were
[1:27:14] born in sin trying to teach us." And
[1:27:16] shoved him out of the church. Knocked
[1:27:18] him out, pushed him out, throw him out.
[1:27:22] But as soon as he was thrown out, did
[1:27:23] you notice Jesus found him again? Amen.
[1:27:29] Amen.
[1:27:31] Jesus found him again. So don't worry if
[1:27:34] they throw you out, you'll find you
[1:27:37] again.
[1:27:38] All right. And he said to him, "Does
[1:27:41] thou believe on the son of God?" He
[1:27:44] said, "Lord, who is he?" He didn't even
[1:27:46] know. But the only thing that he knew
[1:27:48] that where he was blind, he could then
[1:27:50] see. I know this one thing, brother.
[1:27:53] They might call this fanaticism and
[1:27:55] whatever they want to, but I was once
[1:27:57] the sinner.
[1:27:59] I've come into grace now. Something's
[1:28:01] happened to me. See, this one day I I
[1:28:03] now know by trusting his word, by
[1:28:06] believing him, I've been kicked out of
[1:28:09] every organization under the face of
[1:28:11] heaven. There's none of them that will
[1:28:12] receive me anymore. You know that some
[1:28:15] of their man will out here. Good man
[1:28:16] will accept. But every organization is
[1:28:18] thumbs down on me. That's right. But
[1:28:20] he's found me. You find me somewhere.
[1:28:22] That's right. That's right. Come along
[1:28:24] like that. And um so it'll be all right
[1:28:26] because we want to take sides with
[1:28:28] Jesus. And the only way you can take
[1:28:30] sides with Jesus is taking sides on what
[1:28:32] he said, believing his word. So let's
[1:28:34] take sides with him. The blind man gave
[1:28:37] him a real testimony. All right. We find
[1:28:40] again that they tried to blight his name
[1:28:42] just for a little bit. And um I've got
[1:28:45] to skip over some things here. So um one
[1:28:48] time there's a Pharisee. I preached on
[1:28:51] it here some time ago and called it
[1:28:53] washing Jesus' feet. I believe you all
[1:28:56] heard me preach on that here when a
[1:28:58] Pharisee asked Jesus to come down to his
[1:29:01] house, a big old stiff starched Pharisee
[1:29:05] and asked him to come. And you gave it a
[1:29:07] little drama how the courier come and
[1:29:09] found him and he come on down. Yet he
[1:29:12] knowed he was hated yet he went anyhow.
[1:29:15] And when they got him in there, they
[1:29:16] never washed his feet. Let him sit down
[1:29:18] there stinking and everything else to
[1:29:20] the toil of the road. And there he sat
[1:29:22] there and a little woman come in. They
[1:29:24] thought, "Oh my, the Lord is good to us
[1:29:27] because look, this just brings our big
[1:29:29] party." They brought him there just to
[1:29:31] make fun out of him. They brought him
[1:29:32] there just to have some fun from him.
[1:29:34] And now they thought the Lord was
[1:29:36] working right with them because that
[1:29:38] this ill famed prostitute woman come
[1:29:42] over and was crying and washing his feet
[1:29:45] with her tears and wiping with his hair
[1:29:47] and old Pharisee and all the rest of
[1:29:49] priest stand over the corner that
[1:29:50] brother everything the Lord set it up
[1:29:52] just exactly for us here. We can put a
[1:29:54] smear on his name right now. He calls
[1:29:56] himself a prophet and the people think
[1:29:59] that he's a prophet and they call him
[1:30:01] the Galilean prophet and he even claims
[1:30:04] to be the Messiah and we know Messiah
[1:30:06] will be a prophet. And here he is
[1:30:08] sitting back there. You see where we
[1:30:10] brought him? Look at there. Boy, we got
[1:30:11] him fixed right now. There he is sitting
[1:30:14] back there stooped down like a whipped
[1:30:16] out puppy or something back there. And
[1:30:18] some prostitute of his own class would
[1:30:21] come around and wash his feet like that.
[1:30:23] And now he don't even know if he's a
[1:30:25] prophet. He know what kind of a woman
[1:30:27] that was. Now boys will drink on this
[1:30:30] one. That because look at see anything
[1:30:33] to bl his name. Anything to ruin the
[1:30:37] confidence of the people. Amen. Not
[1:30:39] knowing that they were possessed of the
[1:30:41] devil to do that. Amen. Mark that down
[1:30:44] there, brethren. We'll stop at paragraph
[1:30:47] 175. Musicians, if you'll come. Uh this
[1:30:50] being a Wednesday night there. I didn't
[1:30:52] want to be holding you longer. We got
[1:30:54] families and got children need to get
[1:30:56] home. Different ones of you have
[1:30:58] traveled a long ways. Brother Stephen
[1:31:00] just come from Australia. You came in
[1:31:02] today this morning. God bless you. And
[1:31:04] you're here tonight. God bless you.
[1:31:06] Different ones. You all been traveling
[1:31:08] everything. You see how Brother Brandham
[1:31:12] when you go back here and you just
[1:31:14] listen to this. Brother Brandham says,
[1:31:17] "Now look, I don't know where what I'm
[1:31:18] going to do. I don't know where I'm
[1:31:19] going." He said, 'I just got to do
[1:31:22] something. He's in that transition
[1:31:25] period. He's being very transparent.
[1:31:28] He says, u now, I'd like to have some of
[1:31:33] you young ministers that have been
[1:31:35] taught in the message that when I go out
[1:31:37] and I have all these people, and he
[1:31:40] talks about India, and he said, we get
[1:31:43] done with these people, we've got
[1:31:44] thousands of converts, where do we send
[1:31:46] them?
[1:31:49] He said within a couple weeks they go
[1:31:51] filter right off back into that same
[1:31:53] thing. He said I'd love to be able to
[1:31:56] have some that are trained.
[1:31:59] He said that we could have little
[1:32:00] outposts over here and there in this
[1:32:02] country. I think we have failed that
[1:32:06] brethren in many ways because nowadays
[1:32:09] you find that there's very few that are
[1:32:13] willing to go out even into the mission
[1:32:15] field and go out there
[1:32:18] and glean the harvest,
[1:32:21] find that last predestinated seed.
[1:32:25] And even when you go and you you get new
[1:32:27] converts,
[1:32:29] where do you send them?
[1:32:31] Now, we know that there the message is
[1:32:34] gone pretty much all over the world, but
[1:32:37] wouldn't it be nice if there was a new
[1:32:39] group of believers and we had a couple
[1:32:41] brothers here and said, "Hey, we're
[1:32:42] going to send you over there for next 6
[1:32:44] months." Would you be willing to go?
[1:32:48] Would you leave your work,
[1:32:51] go over there in the mission field? It
[1:32:53] cost you. It does. It cost you. You're
[1:32:57] not going to be rich doing missionary
[1:33:00] work.
[1:33:04] But God is a provider, isn't he? Amen.
[1:33:07] God always provides.
[1:33:11] Brother Bram says, "You think that
[1:33:12] because I'm a prophet or man of God, I
[1:33:15] see it in visions." He said, "God makes
[1:33:17] me sweat it out just like he does with
[1:33:18] you."
[1:33:20] Says, "You think that God tells me
[1:33:22] everything?" He's telling you, he's
[1:33:23] being so transparent. I don't know what
[1:33:26] I'm going to do.
[1:33:28] I don't know where I'm going.
[1:33:31] He says, "I'm just like Abraham." Where
[1:33:33] you going, Abraham? I don't know. I'm
[1:33:35] seeking a city whose builder and maker
[1:33:37] is God.
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:40] He said, "These tapes will fall into the
[1:33:43] hands of every predestinated seed." Now,
[1:33:46] understand these tapes don't have legs.
[1:33:50] The ministry does. Amen.
[1:33:53] And the word is carried over the hearts
[1:33:55] of the ministry. They go out and preach
[1:33:58] and then people say, "Where in the world
[1:34:00] did you get this doctrine?" I've never
[1:34:03] heard anybody preach like this. You say,
[1:34:05] "Well, we believe God sent a prophet."
[1:34:07] Hand him a tape, a book, something. Huh?
[1:34:10] He said, "These tapes will fall into the
[1:34:12] hands of every predestinated seat." So,
[1:34:15] we just believe that. And how do how
[1:34:18] many times brother Brenam said, "Now
[1:34:19] look, we Brennhams, we fight in the
[1:34:20] backyard like a bunch of pet dogs." He
[1:34:24] said, 'But you know what he and then he
[1:34:26] said, 'You got to disagreement while we
[1:34:28] Brandons, we get together. He said, 'You
[1:34:29] can't work it out. Get out there and
[1:34:31] duke it out.
[1:34:34] Get in the backyard.
[1:34:38] He said, but then when we get in the
[1:34:40] front yard, we're brands. Amen. Now, I
[1:34:43] think that that's the way it ought to be
[1:34:45] that if we got a disagreement with
[1:34:46] somebody, hey, get there and work it
[1:34:49] out. One thing that I'm seeing right now
[1:34:52] around the world is we're seeing a lot
[1:34:55] of the ministries are coming to a
[1:34:58] maturity
[1:35:00] and they're not they're not trying to
[1:35:02] dysfellowship because you don't see it
[1:35:04] just exactly the way they see it. Their
[1:35:07] churches is sovereign. It does it this
[1:35:10] way. Whatever the way they worship,
[1:35:13] anything.
[1:35:15] And you know, uh, I think that we've
[1:35:18] been just a little bit too hard. We as
[1:35:21] the ministers, well, if you don't see it
[1:35:23] this way, then I don't fellowship with
[1:35:26] you. Well, that's nonsense.
[1:35:28] God help us. Amen. That we might realize
[1:35:31] that this word of God has come together
[1:35:33] to unite us together. Amen. A nickel
[1:35:37] spirit. What does that do? Divide and
[1:35:40] conquer. Yes, sir. So, God, help us to
[1:35:42] be united. Thank you saints. God bless
[1:35:45] you for coming here. Lord willing you be
[1:35:49] praying for me. Lord willing I will be
[1:35:52] ministering on this Sunday. So be
[1:35:54] praying for us. Uh
[1:35:58] that God would just come in here and
[1:36:00] stir us up. Amen. You know what? I'm
[1:36:02] wanting to see
[1:36:05] a real Holy Ghost move among us. Not
[1:36:08] that God's not moving all the time.
[1:36:10] Every Sunday the word of God goes forth
[1:36:12] supernatural. People get a word this and
[1:36:15] that. But I'm talking about something
[1:36:17] that just shakes us up. Amen. Amen. I'm
[1:36:21] really desiring to see us
[1:36:26] get that much closer to God. Let's stand
[1:36:28] together. God bless you all.
[1:36:33] I'll let you know when we're going to
[1:36:35] try to finish up this tape here. And
[1:36:38] appreciate the brethren getting there.
[1:36:39] Don't you enjoy listening to the prophet
[1:36:42] him explaining these things? God help
[1:36:45] us. He says, he said, "If you got an
[1:36:48] issue with this, go back and listen to
[1:36:49] the tape." He said, "This how I'm
[1:36:51] telling you that you ought to do it."
[1:36:53] Amen. God bless you. What's the name of
[1:36:55] this song here that they're singing?
[1:36:57] 10,000. All right. Go ahead and let's
[1:36:59] let's sing it here.
[1:37:02] The sun comes up. It's a new day,
[1:37:08] dawning.
[1:37:10] It's time to sing
[1:37:13] your song again.
[1:37:17] Whatever may pass and whatever lies
[1:37:22] before me.
[1:37:27] Let me be singing when the evening
[1:37:32] comes.
[1:37:34] Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:37:39] oh my soul.
[1:37:43] Worship his holy
[1:37:46] name
[1:37:49] and sing like never before.
[1:37:54] Oh my soul,
[1:37:57] I'll worship your holy
[1:38:01] name. You're rich in love.
[1:38:04] You're rich in love. And you're slow to
[1:38:10] anger.
[1:38:13] Your name is great and your heart is
[1:38:17] kind.
[1:38:19] For all your goodness I will keep on
[1:38:25] singing.
[1:38:27] Ooh.
[1:38:29] 10,000 reasons for my heart to find.
[1:38:36] Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:38:41] Oh my soul.
[1:38:45] Worship his holy
[1:38:48] name
[1:38:51] and sing like never before.
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:56] Oh my soul,
[1:38:59] I'll worship your holy
[1:39:03] name.
[1:39:06] And on that day when my strength is
[1:39:12] failing,
[1:39:14] the ending draws near and my time has
[1:39:19] come.
[1:39:21] Oh, still my soul will sing your praise
[1:39:26] unending.
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:31] 10,000 years and then forever
[1:39:36] more.
[1:39:38] Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:39:44] Oh my soul,
[1:39:47] I'll worship his holy
[1:39:50] name
[1:39:53] and sing like never before.
[1:39:58] Oh my soul,
[1:40:01] I'll worship his home. Sing it one more
[1:40:05] time. The chorus.
[1:40:08] Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:40:13] Oh my soul, I'll worship his holy
[1:40:19] name
[1:40:22] and sing like never before.
[1:40:27] Oh my soul,
[1:40:31] I'll worship your holy
[1:40:34] name.
[1:40:36] Amen. Brother Freddy, would you close
[1:40:38] the service in a word of prayer?
[1:40:48] Shall we bow our heads and our hearts at
[1:40:50] the same time?
[1:40:52] Our precious and heavenly father,
[1:40:55] it was good indeed to be in your
[1:40:57] presence this evening. Oh God,
[1:41:01] if it was given a chance to these mortal
[1:41:04] bodies, we would have been somewhere
[1:41:05] else. but because of your guidance
[1:41:08] because of your Holy Spirit, you have
[1:41:11] guided us to be on this place at this
[1:41:13] very moment. Thank you, Lord. Like the
[1:41:15] David of the old said, I'm happy when
[1:41:18] they tell me to go to the temple of the
[1:41:20] Lord. Father, we are blessed people. We
[1:41:23] heard from the maf of God, the prophet
[1:41:27] of this end time. Father, may you bless
[1:41:30] our souls. May you keep us, oh God,
[1:41:33] united, humble under the leadership of
[1:41:35] the Holy Spirit. May you bless each and
[1:41:38] every one of us, oh father. Keep us
[1:41:40] humble and keep us, oh God, safe under
[1:41:43] this message. Oh father, seeing the
[1:41:45] lateness of the hour, how people are
[1:41:47] walking away from the message, things
[1:41:49] happening left and right. Oh father,
[1:41:51] this is a very critical time. Give us a
[1:41:54] holy spirit and the spirit that can keep
[1:41:56] us humble. Keep us walking on the right
[1:42:00] pathway. Oh God. He behooves your Holy
[1:42:02] Spirit. He behooves your guidance. Oh
[1:42:04] father, for us to walk, oh God,
[1:42:07] straight, oh Jesus. Be merciful unto us,
[1:42:11] oh God. Forgive our shortcomings and
[1:42:14] everything, oh God, that we have done
[1:42:16] that is not of your word. Oh Jesus,
[1:42:18] bless us as a congregation. Bless your
[1:42:21] servant, our pastor. as he came back oh
[1:42:23] father from a trip he didn't come he
[1:42:25] didn't go oh god to spend his time in
[1:42:27] vain but he went to feed the souls oh
[1:42:30] Jesus brother Stephen and all the
[1:42:32] brothers that have traveled and some
[1:42:34] still out oh God may you bless them oh
[1:42:36] Jesus bring us back here safely on

[1:42:41] your word again may you keep us safely

[1:42:46] being separated temporarily oh God not

[1:42:54] we'll be doing. And oh Jesus,
[1:42:58] may you get glory out of our lives. Oh
[1:43:00] Jesus. We ask all of this in the name of
[1:43:03] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:43:12] Can't you see why I'm so happy? Can't
[1:43:14] you see?
