[32:04] need to be here just to receive that and
[32:07] it's it's just a blessing but while
[32:09] you're standing if you would turn with
[32:11] me over the book of Second Kings the
[32:13] e8th chapter I hate to dismiss the
[32:16] musicians because so beautiful
[32:20] music Second Kings the 8th chapter and
[32:23] then we're going to take one verse
[32:25] from Matthew the 11 the chapter
[32:28] certainly hatte it brother Ron's not
[32:30] here I always look forward to seeing
[32:31] brother Ron and uh
[32:35] enjoy fellowshipping with him and just
[32:38] uh have a high regard for brother Ron
[32:41] his uh his he's just you know Spirit The
[32:45] Humble spirit that he has it's just it's
[32:46] a blessing to be around not everybody's
[32:49] that way God help us all to be more like
[32:51] that amen Second Kings the 8th chapter
[32:54] starting in the first verse it says then
[32:57] SP Elisha unto the woman whose son he
[32:59] had restored to life saying arise and go
[33:02] thou and thine household and sojourn
[33:04] whatsoever thou can adjourn for the Lord
[33:07] have called for a famine and it shall
[33:10] also come upon the land seven years and
[33:12] the woman arose and did after the saying
[33:14] of the man of God and she went with her
[33:16] household and sojourned in the land of
[33:18] the Philistines seven years and it came
[33:20] to pass at the seven years end that the
[33:23] woman returned out of the land of the
[33:24] Philistines and she went forth to cist
[33:27] to the king for her house and for her
[33:29] land and the King talked to
[33:32] jhaza uh the servant of the man of God
[33:34] saying tell me I pray thee all the great
[33:37] things that Elisha have Elisha have done
[33:41] and it came to pass as he was telling
[33:43] the King how he had restored a dead body
[33:45] to life that behold the woman whose son
[33:47] he had restored to life Cried unto the
[33:49] king for her house and for her land and
[33:52] gahasa said my Lord O King this is the
[33:55] woman and this this is her son whom
[33:58] Elisha restored to life and when the
[34:00] king had asked the woman she told him so
[34:02] the king appointed unto her a certain
[34:05] officer saying restore all that was hers
[34:07] and all the fruits of the field since
[34:10] the day that she left the land even unto
[34:13] now now just one verse over in Matthew
[34:16] the 11th
[34:18] chapter Matthew the 11th chapter the
[34:20] 12th verse and it says and from the days
[34:23] of John the Baptist until now the

[34:29] violence and the violent take it by
[34:32] force let's just by our hearts Heavenly

[35:25] tonight
[35:27] you you know this woman that we read
[35:30] here from in 2 Kings the 8th chapter we
[35:33] know her as the shunamite woman which
[35:35] was Barren and had no children but
[35:37] because of her uh willingness to uh hear
[35:42] the prophet that God had sent to him
[35:44] because she was willing to make
[35:46] accommodations and make room for the
[35:49] prophet of God in her life that God was
[35:52] merciful to her opened up a be womb gave
[35:54] her a son we know the story that as a
[35:57] son grew that he was out in the field
[35:58] with his father one day and he cried out
[36:00] my head my head and fainted and the
[36:03] father took the son to the mother and he
[36:05] died upon her lap and then she rode to
[36:08] Elijah and cried out you know and and
[36:12] Elisha come and laid upon the child and
[36:15] and the Li's child was restored and
[36:17] that's the story that Gaza here uh the
[36:20] servant is telling the king as this
[36:23] woman is in the court and she had done
[36:25] what the prophet had told water he said
[36:27] there's a there's a famine that is
[36:28] coming in this land and so you know you
[36:32] need to you need to make Provisions you
[36:34] need to go somewhere you need to sourn
[36:35] somewhere that you can go to to find uh
[36:39] relief during this famine and she'd done
[36:41] that but when she came back to her home
[36:44] I guess much to her surprise here she
[36:46] finds someone else that is occupying her
[36:49] home in her lands while she's gone you
[36:52] know nobody's home nobody's there she
[36:54] thinks hey I'll I'll I'll move we'll
[36:56] move in we'll take over we take control
[36:58] and she finds that now being uh a widow
[37:01] at this point being uh you know having
[37:04] maybe a small household and a son you
[37:06] know maybe she didn't have the
[37:07] provisions or the means to try to take
[37:10] back what belongs to her so she went to
[37:13] the she goes to the king and she brings
[37:15] her petition before the king and and you
[37:17] know it's not a
[37:19] coincidence there's a lot of things
[37:21] happen in her life that are not
[37:22] coincidence and it was not a coincident
[37:24] the Gaza was there telling the stories
[37:26] that as he tells his story he looks out
[37:28] and there's that woman crying out for
[37:31] what belongs to her amen so and he said
[37:34] that's the woman this is the woman this
[37:37] is her and you you know the story read
[37:40] the story here now let me just let me
[37:43] just take this bring this around just a
[37:46] little bit here to our thank you brother
[37:48] Mark to where we're at today and where
[37:50] we're living today if you drove home
[37:53] tonight from this church service and you
[37:56] pulled in a your driveway or your Ranch
[37:58] whatever you might have and you notied
[38:00] hey there's here somebody's pulled in a
[38:02] camper and they're parked in my yard or
[38:05] they're parked beside my house and you
[38:08] know I don't know who these people are
[38:10] they they they've hooked their they've
[38:12] hooked up to my water spet on the side
[38:14] of my house they've run a h a cord and
[38:17] they hooked into my
[38:19] electricity they' set out their lawn
[38:21] chairs and I would say they build a fire
[38:24] but you don't need one out here right
[38:26] they they don't need a fire just fry
[38:28] your eggs on the sidewalk or whatever
[38:31] listen the Bible tells us over the Book
[38:32] of Revelations the third chapter to our
[38:34] all to see in church I would that thou
[38:35] were hot amen y'all have arrived y'all
[38:39] have made it okay y'all have made it
[38:41] youve made it amen so you know you but
[38:44] you see amen they just made yourself all
[38:46] they pulled into your property they
[38:47] don't you don't know who they are you
[38:49] don't know what's what's going on and
[38:50] and I don't know maybe maybe you you you
[38:53] uh maybe maybe you don't mind I I I
[38:57] don't know but I I don't how would you
[38:58] respond to that you know here's somebody
[39:00] that is pulled into your your back lot
[39:02] or whatever and they've hooked up to
[39:04] your utilities and they've got a camper
[39:06] in and you don't know who these people
[39:07] are you know that would probably
[39:10] challenge your Christian
[39:14] character yeah I mean you know you'd try
[39:17] not to get red in the face you'd try to
[39:18] be kind and gentle but that that
[39:21] probably wouldn't last very long and uh
[39:24] but so you could you could imagine amen
[39:26] somebody that is there what would you do
[39:28] what would you how would you respond I
[39:29] mean you know you you might first say
[39:31] well let me go over and talk to these
[39:32] people and say Hey you know I don't know
[39:33] where maybe you're supposed to be at
[39:34] maybe you think you're at somebody
[39:35] else's place this is mine this is not
[39:37] your Uncle Bill's or whatever you know
[39:39] you're at the wrong place or you you
[39:41] might try that but if you didn't get
[39:42] anywhere with that and they said oh no
[39:43] this is where we're supposed to be we're
[39:45] staying here you know and so on you know
[39:47] probably the next thing you do is go in
[39:48] a house and call Maricopa County Deputy
[39:51] department or Sheriff's Department
[39:52] whatever and say Hey you know I got some
[39:54] people transp you probably would take
[39:56] action as this shite woman did I mean
[39:59] she sees somebody is encroaching upon
[40:02] what belongs to her and she says you
[40:05] know I'm not just going to tolerate this
[40:07] I'm going to do something about it amen
[40:09] I'm going to I'm going to take action
[40:11] against this and so you know there's a
[40:13] thing called and this is the title of
[40:15] the message tonight is the law of
[40:18] adverse
[40:19] possession and I'll tell you a little
[40:22] bit what the the law of adverse
[40:23] possession is because every off 50
[40:26] states have some version of adverse
[40:29] possession you know some people call it
[40:31] squatter's rights but the technical term
[40:34] is really the the is adverse possession
[40:37] and and so knowing I was going to preach
[40:39] this here tonight I looked see let's see
[40:41] what Arizona's law of adverse possession
[40:44] is and according to Arizona General
[40:46] statute 12-
[40:49] 521 you can write that into your notes
[40:52] if you want to it defines adverse
[40:54] possession as an actual and visible
[40:57] appropriation of the land commenced and
[41:00] continued under a claim of right
[41:03] inconsistent with in hostile to the
[41:05] claim of another so in other words you
[41:08] know what you're sitting there I'm
[41:09] paying a mortgage on this piece of
[41:11] property and here's somebody else has
[41:13] tried to move in on it amen on your
[41:16] property so they're trying they they're
[41:18] there adversely they're not there by
[41:20] your permission they are they're on your
[41:23] property and they're they're trying to
[41:25] take control now also in Arizona every
[41:28] all 50 states their their law is a
[41:30] little bit different uh than some you
[41:34] know each one they each state is
[41:36] Sovereign and they've got their
[41:37] different laws but under Arizona law
[41:40] five
[41:42] 12-52 and 12- 526 a party claiming
[41:46] adverse possession has the burden to
[41:49] show that his or her possession was one
[41:53] hostile two exclusive three actual four
[41:57] open and notorious and five continuous
[42:00] for the statutory period of 10 years so
[42:03] if that person stays on that property
[42:05] they have no claim to that proper if
[42:06] they stay there with meeting those five
[42:09] conditions and they have to prove those
[42:10] five conditions then they can take claim
[42:13] to that piece of
[42:15] property that's adverse possession now
[42:17] in North Carolina you got to do it for
[42:19] 20 years we're not quite as nice to
[42:21] squatters you know you're going to be
[42:23] there 22 years in North Carolina and
[42:25] prove those basically s five things
[42:27] you're hostile so it means you don't
[42:29] have permission to be there you're
[42:31] exclusive means you're not doing it with
[42:33] a a party of people it is you or your
[42:36] family whatever it is actually you
[42:38] actually are in possession of the
[42:40] property opening Ator you're not doing
[42:42] it you're not hiding the fact that
[42:44] you're trying to take over someone
[42:46] else's property you're not slipping in
[42:48] you know and and encroaching on the
[42:49] property while they're gone to work
[42:51] during the day no you're there openly
[42:54] notoriously and you're doing it Contin
[42:56] iously for that t period not not that
[42:58] hey you know what I'm going to go over
[42:59] here I'm going to try to take what oh
[43:00] brother Mark's got a nice place there
[43:02] and he goes to Canada everol them so I'm
[43:04] going to slip he's gone to Canada I'm
[43:05] going to slip up there in his property
[43:08] to try to take adverse possession well
[43:10] you know he comes back in a couple
[43:11] months say well I got to go until he
[43:12] goes again it don't work it's got to be
[43:14] continuous open adverse continuous I
[43:18] mean so this is this is the the law of
[43:20] adverse possession now in that most
[43:24] States also have what's called a color
[43:27] of title does that make sense to anybody
[43:29] color of title some of you brother Ezra
[43:31] is shaking his head yes some of you know
[43:32] what color of title is well let me read
[43:34] to what color of title is color of title
[43:37] refers to a document other instrument
[43:39] that appears to be a legitimate claim or
[43:43] title of title to a piece of land but
[43:46] due to a title defect cannot transfer or
[43:49] convey ownership maybe that deed was
[43:52] never properly recorded and somebody
[43:54] thinks hey you know this belongs to me
[43:56] and I've I I've got a piece of paper
[43:58] here I've got a a deed but maybe it's
[44:00] never properly recorded maybe the taxes
[44:02] weren't paid uh it was for closed on
[44:04] sold to somebody else and yet they
[44:06] they've got a deed or maybe something
[44:08] says they inherited the property
[44:09] whatever it may be a color of title now
[44:11] in Arizona if you've got color of title
[44:14] you only have to adversely uh possess
[44:16] the
[44:17] property for two years two years now
[44:21] before anybody in here gets any ideas
[44:23] that this is a good way to go get
[44:25] property we are
[44:30] Christians and that would be stealing
[44:32] right that would be stealing I mean
[44:34] somebody come and took your property you
[44:35] would think hey they're stealing this
[44:37] from me because I've been paying the
[44:38] mortgage and they're taking this away
[44:40] from me so we as Christians we don't do
[44:43] that right amen so but we see now North
[44:45] Carolina if you've got color of title
[44:46] it's seven years so again we're not
[44:48] quite as generous as you are out here in
[44:51] the southwest now so we see amen that
[44:54] that somebody's doing that we find a
[44:55] woman here this udite woman that she
[44:57] comes back home she finds out that
[44:59] somebody's been on her property these
[45:01] seven years while she's gone they
[45:03] possessing her property and she's got to
[45:06] do something about this she doesn't
[45:07] doesn't accept that now this we're
[45:10] speaking in is of the natural but let's
[45:12] bring this around to where it's
[45:14] applicable to all of us which is in the
[45:17] spiritual realm right the Bible tells me
[45:19] in John the 10th chapter the 10th verse
[45:21] says the thief cometh not but to
[45:24] steal
[45:27] to
[45:28] kill and to destroy that's what the
[45:31] enemy comes to do that's this enemy he
[45:34] wants he's a thief amen so he wants to
[45:36] take what belongs to you he wants to
[45:39] take what is your god-given right he
[45:42] wants to take what God has blessed you
[45:44] with and adversely possess what belongs
[45:47] to you now listen if he has color color
[45:51] of title he has a right he has a right
[45:55] amen prophet of God told us in the
[45:57] message inspiration 19556 he said I
[46:01] watch solemnly everything to see the
[46:04] first version or Vision excuse me what
[46:07] God will say do for you might Stomp and
[46:10] kick and anoint and everything else and
[46:11] if the devil has a right in there
[46:14] anything in your heart that's
[46:15] unconfessed or any unbelief or any
[46:17] doubting anything in there anything that
[46:19] you refuse to do or not the devil will
[46:22] lay right there cuz he has a right to he
[46:25] a color of title to come on and to
[46:27] trespass within your life and to take
[46:30] the things that belong to you amen so if
[46:32] he's got a color of title amen you know
[46:33] what you can come up and say pre
[46:35] Preacher Brother Ron whoever please pray
[46:37] for me I've got this going on Amen but
[46:39] if that devil has a right to be in your
[46:41] life because you've opened up the door
[46:43] to allow him to stay in there amen the
[46:45] preacher can SN Stomp and snort and and
[46:47] pour oil whatever else brother brandham
[46:49] says here to do amen and it will not
[46:51] work because the devil's going to lay
[46:52] right there as long as he has the right
[46:55] to do so he's got a claim in your life
[46:58] amen so if he has that claim if you've
[47:00] given him that opportunity to make a
[47:01] claim you can try to fight against enemy
[47:04] all you want to amen but you've got to
[47:05] do something about what gives him the
[47:07] right to be in your life amen now I'm
[47:10] going to tell you something the devil
[47:11] attacks every single one of us right
[47:13] amen first Peter the 5th chapter amen
[47:16] the eth verse says be sober be
[47:19] vigilant because your
[47:23] adversary can you point a finger at
[47:25] yourself and say my adversary my
[47:27] adversary he's your adversary you have
[47:30] an adversary you have someone that's out
[47:33] to do detriment to you spiritually
[47:36] physically emotionally mentally to to
[47:39] steal to kill and to destroy right he is
[47:42] your adversary we cannot forget amen
[47:44] that we have an adversary that we're
[47:46] fighting every day we don't see it amen
[47:48] the trouble is sometimes amen we see the
[47:51] wife instead of seeing the adversary
[47:53] behind the wife amen don't don't any of
[47:56] you Brothers elbow your wife that's not
[47:58] what I meant heyen but you know you we
[48:01] we see the neighbor that is being
[48:03] adverse to it but we don't see the
[48:05] adversary the devil that is behind the
[48:07] neighbor we see the person on the job
[48:09] amen that is that is doing something
[48:11] amen detrimental to us amen but we don't
[48:14] see the devil and the devil loves to
[48:16] hide behind people he loves to hide
[48:18] behind skin amen and we we fail to see a
[48:21] lot of times that it's a devil that is
[48:22] doing the attacking amen instead of it's
[48:25] not it's not my neighbor it's not my uh
[48:28] uh my family or whoever it is it's it's
[48:30] the enemy amen so you've got to remember
[48:32] amen be sober be vigilant because your
[48:35] adversary the devil the Bible tells us
[48:38] your adversary my adversary is the devil
[48:41] the opponent that is trying to destroy
[48:44] me trying to destroy you is the devil
[48:47] amen the one that is trying to take
[48:49] possession of your god-given inherited
[48:52] rights and I ain't talking about the
[48:53] constitutional rights of the United
[48:55] States I'm talking about your your
[48:57] scriptural rights amen is the Devil he's
[49:01] the one that is out to do these things
[49:03] against you so be sober be vigilant
[49:05] because your
[49:06] adversary the devil as a roaring line
[49:10] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[49:13] whom he's whom he can consume or swallow
[49:15] now I want you to notice in this
[49:17] scripture it uses the term
[49:20] May amen May implies right not the
[49:25] ability
[49:26] whom he may whom he has the right to
[49:30] consume whom he has a claim to someone's
[49:33] life or to come into someone's home
[49:35] maybe the door is open in someone's home
[49:38] and he comes in and listen if you know
[49:39] the about you you've heard the say and
[49:41] giv me in she takes a m you open the
[49:43] door he walks in you know uh he's he's
[49:45] there constantly trying to barge his way
[49:47] in so you know he he's seeking whom he
[49:50] may who he has the right Amen to come
[49:53] into their life to try to do detriment
[49:56] to your life he is our adversary so we
[49:59] recognize that the scripture tells us
[50:01] Ephesians the 6th chapter the 12th verse
[50:03] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[50:06] too often we're engaged I mean we want
[50:07] to we we want our battle to be with
[50:09] somebody that we can see amen instead of
[50:11] the one we cannot see the devil that is
[50:13] working behind the scenes we wrestle not
[50:15] against flesh and blood but against
[50:16] principalities against Powers against
[50:18] the rulers of Darkness of this world
[50:20] against spiritual wickedness in high
[50:22] places amen so that's the one that we
[50:24] are constantly engaged in battling with
[50:28] uh uh on a daily basis and if you don't
[50:31] recognize that if you don't recognize
[50:33] he's the one that is coming against you
[50:35] or coming against your children uh
[50:37] coming against you emotionally playing
[50:39] games in your mind remember the prophet
[50:41] of God talked about the greatest battle
[50:42] ever fought was here in this in this the
[50:44] mind the Mind Games of Satan wages if we
[50:47] fail to recognize that then he's going
[50:49] to have the upper hand against us I mean
[50:51] one of the greatest strategies in war is
[50:54] the the element of surpris right the
[50:56] enemy doesn't know that you're there and
[50:58] at the last minute you spring the attack
[51:01] whenever they're least expect and when
[51:03] Satan tries that on a daily basis with
[51:06] Believers and so that's that's the
[51:08] adversary that we're facing but the
[51:10] scripture here goes on in this 1 Peter
[51:12] the 5th chapter The 91st say whom resist
[51:15] steadfast in the faith so you have an
[51:19] obligation to resist this enemy and
[51:22] you're not doing it in your own
[51:24] intellect you're not doing it in your
[51:25] own strength or your own ability says in
[51:27] the faith you are standing in the faith
[51:29] when you get outside the faith and you
[51:31] start trying to uh uh uh to fight
[51:34] against the enemy outside of the faith
[51:37] you are on his ground you are fighting
[51:39] in his territory amen but here the
[51:42] scripture says you resist him steadfast
[51:46] in the faith that is Our obligation now
[51:49] let's go back to adverse possession if
[51:51] someone has moved on to your property
[51:55] and and you do nothing in that
[51:57] designated statutory period they will
[52:00] take title to what belongs to you so for
[52:04] you to prevent that you have to take
[52:06] action you can't ignore it think well
[52:08] you know what I I'm going to be the good
[52:10] guy and you know I I'll just hey you
[52:13] know we'll we'll tolerate this and and
[52:15] they'll just get tired and they'll pull
[52:16] away we won't have to go to court and we
[52:18] won't have to do all these things no if
[52:21] if that person stays there persisting
[52:22] for the statutory period of time they
[52:25] meet those five conditions they can take
[52:27] title to that piece of property your
[52:30] property what belongs to you and that's
[52:32] exactly what the devil is trying to do
[52:34] amen there's things that belong to you
[52:37] amen that he is trying to take away from
[52:40] you amen amen he wants to rob you of
[52:43] these things he is the thief amen so for

[52:51] faith Amen to prevent him from taking

[52:57] take away your joy amen he will make you
[53:01] Restless amen he'll make you
[53:03] unsettled amen we've got that today a me
[53:06] people that are unsettled people that
[53:08] are not established and so forth and the
[53:10] enemy's doing that the Bible tells us
[53:11] Amen in Ephesians the 4th chapter 27
[53:14] verse neither give place to the devil
[53:17] you don't make you don't make
[53:19] concessions with the devil amen you
[53:21] don't you don't compromise with the
[53:23] devil you don't say you know what you
[53:25] can have this little little section over
[53:27] here me you don't give him that am
[53:29] because he's never satisfied with just a
[53:31] little bit amen he wants it all he wants
[53:34] everything that you haveen so you have
[53:36] got to resist him you've got to never
[53:38] give him a PL you got to resist him you
[53:40] got to take action against him unless
[53:43] you want him to take what belongs to you
[53:46] amen see that devil that that that that
[53:49] pulls into your front yard he wants to
[53:51] hook into your water supply he wants to
[53:53] drain you dry
[53:56] Hey listen you may live in a desert but
[53:58] you don't have to be dry are you with me
[54:01] amen no matter how hot it may be outside
[54:03] don't mean you got to be dry on the
[54:05] inside but if you let that devil come
[54:07] and pull his camper into your life and
[54:10] hook up to your water supply he is going
[54:12] to drain you dry amen you cannot allow
[54:15] that you've got to resist that and you
[54:17] know what else he wants to do he wants
[54:18] to plug into your power source amen so
[54:20] that you become Weak and Powerless amen
[54:23] you can't allow the enemy Amen to come
[54:25] in and take control in your life amen
[54:28] you have to resist him you have to
[54:31] resist him amen so we see that amen we
[54:34] don't we don't allow him to take control
[54:36] do whatever he wants to do amen
[54:38] Revelations the the 12th chapter very
[54:41] familiar scripture here in the 10th
[54:43] verse it says and I heard a voice saying
[54:47] in heaven now has come the salvation and
[54:49] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[54:51] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[54:54] of our Brethren is cast down which
[54:57] accused him before our God day and night
[55:00] we know who that is that is the devil
[55:03] that is that one that is trying to steal
[55:05] away from you he's there trying to
[55:09] accuse you know he's trying to make his
[55:11] claim Before the Throne he's trying to
[55:15] come and say well look God you know here
[55:17] here's here's this brother and and you
[55:19] know that he on on on August the 2nd
[55:22] that he told a lie well that's not you
[55:25] that's mine that's my claim that is my I
[55:28] put that claim on here you you see this
[55:30] sister over here you know that you know
[55:32] she she did this or this brother did
[55:34] that you know he's the one that's
[55:35] accusing I mean look at this I mean he
[55:37] was accusing amen day and night he was
[55:41] making his claim against you and so he's
[55:45] making a claim he's saying this this
[55:47] this belongs to me it is my right Amen
[55:49] to bring misery to bring sickness to
[55:52] bring defeat amen all these things
[55:55] things and into this individual's life
[55:56] amen so he's making that claim that he
[55:58] has that right to do that against you
[56:01] before the throne doing this amen but
[56:05] thank God for the next verse the 11th
[56:08] verse and they overcame him who overcame
[56:14] him we overcome him right they didn't
[56:16] say Jesus overcoming in in this and me
[56:19] they overcame now I know that he
[56:21] defeated the devil he the devil is
[56:23] defeated amen but we've got to overcome
[56:25] the claim that he's trying to make
[56:27] against us and so here is he's making
[56:30] his claim and they overcame him by the
[56:32] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[56:34] their testimony and so in other words
[56:37] here's the Devil he's Before the Throne
[56:39] trying to make his claim uh uh to get
[56:42] into his right to get into your life to
[56:44] do what he wants to do well you've got
[56:45] to have a testimony amen you something
[56:48] to say about that you've got to be able
[56:50] to come and say well hey wait a minute I
[56:52] got something to say I got a testimony I
[56:54] got something to side God let me make my
[56:56] claim in this situation right so if if
[57:00] it's what the devil says and and versus
[57:03] what you
[57:04] say you know it's your word versus his
[57:06] word
[57:07] right and the scripture tells us you've
[57:11] read it in the New Testament Jesus
[57:12] quoted in the mouth of two or three
[57:14] Witnesses let every word be established
[57:17] well that comes from Deuteronomy the
[57:19] 19th Chapter and the 15th verse where
[57:21] that is in the Old Testament I wanted to
[57:23] read that it said one witness shall not
[57:26] rise up against a man for any iniquity
[57:28] or for any sin in any sin that he sinth
[57:31] at the mouth of two witnesses or at the
[57:34] mouth of three Witnesses shall shall the
[57:37] matter be
[57:38] established so it's not just well it's
[57:40] my word against the devil's word is he
[57:42] standing there day and night you know
[57:43] and and he said well you know Lindy MCR
[57:45] he did this on such such date and he did
[57:47] this on this date and he did this on
[57:48] this date and and he's he's got a big
[57:50] thick book you know and he just keeps
[57:51] saying Li is you know that's what he's
[57:53] saying so I said oh wait a minute you
[57:55] know so my testimony has got to count in
[57:57] there somewhere but ends up being my
[57:58] word against his
[58:00] word and so there's got to be more to it
[58:03] than that but the word testimony here
[58:06] that we read uh in this uh Revelations
[58:10] the 12th chapter and 11 verse it's an
[58:12] Evidence given a record or report a
[58:15] witness so you know our our report has
[58:18] got to be against what the enemy's
[58:20] report is when he's making the claim but
[58:23] he is trying to adverse possess what
[58:26] belongs to you we've got to have a
[58:27] testimony that says otherwise Our
[58:31] Testimony has got to be different amen
[58:32] our testimonies has got to be something
[58:34] greater because you know what he comes
[58:36] he trespasses he wants to take away your
[58:38] health he wants to take away your joy he
[58:39] wants to take away your peace he wants
[58:41] to take away your your power he wants to
[58:43] take away your spiritual benefits he
[58:44] wants to take away your spiritual
[58:46] Heritage he wants to take away your
[58:47] children amen he wants to take all these
[58:50] things away from you I I had a little
[58:54] bit of a re Revelation the other day we
[58:55] we we Sharon and I we we got a little
[58:57] rental house we don't want to be
[58:58] landlords I don't like being a landlord
[59:00] but it just it's in front of us and I
[59:02] knew that if it it was going up for sale
[59:04] I bought it because I knew if I didn't
[59:06] somebody else control it and I don't
[59:07] like being a landord I don't like fixing
[59:08] my commode let alone had to go fix
[59:10] somebody else's okay just plain simple
[59:13] and so uh but finally after five years
[59:16] the the renters moved out and so I went
[59:18] down the other day to I went down the
[59:19] other day to to to start measuring
[59:22] Windows to replace windows and so forth
[59:23] in a little real house and I walked in
[59:25] and it was so filthy it was awful it was
[59:29] awful I I literally we took a shovel and
[59:32] was
[59:33] shoveling I held away three pickup
[59:37] truckloads of big trash bags I mean
[59:39] heaping just in in two hours when I get
[59:42] back home I get to go back do a whole
[59:44] bunch more than that you know and and it
[59:46] was just it was awful I was like I was
[59:49] like you know this is this is terrible I
[59:52] mean you know animals don't live this
[59:54] filthy
[59:55] animals there was no animals in the
[59:56] house animals this was
[59:59] people they don't people I mean animals
[1:00:01] don't live that filthy and you know I I
[1:00:04] say hey God created us in His image the
[1:00:08] devil perverted us into His Image that's
[1:00:12] what the devil did and that's how some
[1:00:14] people they don't live like animals they
[1:00:15] look like live like Devils filth amen
[1:00:19] they they they don't mind the filth and
[1:00:21] so forth amen but that's what some
[1:00:23] people thrive hereen that's what God
[1:00:25] intended for us and the devil wants to
[1:00:27] take all that away he wants to take all
[1:00:29] the blessings of God away from your life
[1:00:32] amen he wants to take the anointing of
[1:00:34] God away from your life amen but there's
[1:00:37] got to be a testimony against that enemy
[1:00:40] amen no matter what his claim is amen
[1:00:42] your testimony must claim what belongs
[1:00:46] to you this is mine amen this don't
[1:00:49] belong to the devil this is mine it was
[1:00:52] bought for me amen it was purchased for
[1:00:54] for me a I didn't purchase it the peace
[1:00:57] that I have it's not my peace it is his
[1:00:59] peace my peace I give unto you amen amen
[1:01:02] so it don't belong it wasn't M I didn't
[1:01:04] work it out amen Jesus Christ amen he
[1:01:06] worked it out for me he gave it to me it
[1:01:09] belongs to me amen that is my testimony
[1:01:12] amen amen you've got to receive that
[1:01:14] amen you can't just let the enemy take
[1:01:16] it away from you amen the Bible tells us
[1:01:18] in James the 4th chapter and sth verse
[1:01:20] says submit yourself therefore to God
[1:01:23] and resist the devil and he will flee
[1:01:26] from you you got to do it amen you know
[1:01:29] I I I've tried it as a as a pastor as a
[1:01:32] minister I have tried to resist the
[1:01:35] devil for other
[1:01:37] people if that person doesn't do the
[1:01:39] resisting it does no good for me brother
[1:01:43] Ron anybody else you get whoever it
[1:01:46] don't matter amen it takes that person's
[1:01:49] got to have their will their will has to
[1:01:52] be interjected amen into the equation
[1:01:55] amen it doesn't do for me just to try to
[1:01:57] resist the devil in your behalf amen we
[1:02:00] can do that we can try amen but if if
[1:02:03] your will is to allow the enemy to come
[1:02:05] into your life amen I can't override
[1:02:08] that and and the prophet God said the
[1:02:10] Holy Ghost doesn't override that doesn't
[1:02:13] override your will amen so amen you have
[1:02:15] to resist the devil and he will flee
[1:02:17] from you now so you've got a testimony
[1:02:19] you've got to have a testimony of what
[1:02:22] belongs to you amen what is yours what
[1:02:25] is your right what was purchased for you
[1:02:27] Hebrews the 3D chapter the first verse
[1:02:31] says wherefore holy Brethren partakers
[1:02:34] of the Heavenly call and consider the
[1:02:35] Apostle and high priest of our
[1:02:38] profession Christ Jesus our profession

[1:02:58] you confess that you accept it that you
[1:03:01] confess what he said by his stripes I
[1:03:04] was healed then then he's the high
[1:03:07] priest to make intercession Upon Our
[1:03:10] confession so you amen you've got that's
[1:03:13] where your testimony comes in amen
[1:03:15] you've got to be able to say hey you

[1:04:01] amen he begins to act upon and he said
[1:04:04] then he said first you've got to profess
[1:04:07] you that you accept amen then he is the
[1:04:10] high priest to make intercession Upon
[1:04:12] Our confession in the the message the
[1:04:14] results of decision brother says he's

[1:04:18] Hebrews 3 and any of you Brethren know
[1:04:21] that Prof confess and profess there is
[1:04:23] the same word so he's the high priest of
[1:04:26] our confession he can't do nothing until

[1:13:12] anything that I did right it'll not be
[1:13:15] because I deserved it be because he paid
[1:13:18] the price don't ever forget it amen and
[1:13:21] the price that he paid when we allow the
[1:13:23] enemy take away what belongs to us amen
[1:13:25] we're letting him Rob we're letting him
[1:13:28] blaspheme or or defame the sacrifice
[1:13:31] that Jesus made for us it means I don't
[1:13:33] care have you ever seen some rich
[1:13:36] kids that get everything you heard of
[1:13:39] being born with the the Golden Spoon or
[1:13:41] the Silver Spoon whatever color spoon is
[1:13:42] I think I had a a toothpick stuck in my
[1:13:44] mouth when I was
[1:13:46] born that's why I got the Gaff in the
[1:13:48] front teeth and so but you've heard of
[1:13:51] people being born with a silver spoon
[1:13:53] right I mean the kids get everything I
[1:13:54] mean you remember the kids that go to
[1:13:56] high school and they're driving a new
[1:13:57] BMW or whatever going to high
[1:14:00] school
[1:14:02] really I drove a 1974 Pinto station
[1:14:05] wagon with wood grain
[1:14:08] panels God knew I needed
[1:14:11] humility and that'll do it for you okay
[1:14:14] but you've seen people like that right
[1:14:16] but they have no
[1:14:17] appreciation for what has been given to
[1:14:20] them if anybody gets in trouble they're
[1:14:22] going to be the ones that get in trouble
[1:14:22] cuz they're trash it they don't care
[1:14:24] about
[1:14:25] it how could we be that with the blood
[1:14:27] of Jesus Christ how could we be with
[1:14:29] that like what he bought for
[1:14:33] me how can I disrespect the sacrifice
[1:14:37] that he made just to let the enemy come
[1:14:39] in and try to take it away from me not
[1:14:43] to contend I mean you know it say in the
[1:14:45] book of Jew says contend for the faith
[1:14:48] that was once delivered unto the you
[1:14:49] cond it means you're fighting for what
[1:14:51] was once delivered to us you're fighting
[1:14:53] for it it means enough that you're going
[1:14:54] to fight for it you're not just going to
[1:14:56] let it be taken away from you me so
[1:14:58] don't let the enemy just come in and try
[1:15:00] to possess what belongs to you now so we
[1:15:03] see amen that the scripture tells us
[1:15:05] there in Revelations the 12th chapter it
[1:15:06] was not just our testimony but it was
[1:15:08] the blood of the Lamb amen that we
[1:15:11] overcome the Devil by that he was
[1:15:14] defeated by the blood of the lamb now
[1:15:16] Hebrews
[1:15:18] 1224 says to Jesus the mediator of the
[1:15:21] New Covenant and to the blood of
[1:15:23] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[1:15:26] than that of Abel so here's the blood
[1:15:29] that was paid for us and we know that
[1:15:32] that blood that was that paid the debt
[1:15:35] for us was put upon the mercy seat and
[1:15:38] that mercy seat if you go back into the
[1:15:40] old test find that Mercy Seat was at the
[1:15:42] throne right was at uh the ark of the
[1:15:45] covenant was at the presence of God here
[1:15:47] it is at the right hand of God so here's
[1:15:49] the enemy that's standing before God
[1:15:51] accusing us there but here here's of
[1:15:53] blood sitting there at the throne on The
[1:15:56] Mercy Seat and this Blood speaketh
[1:15:59] better things than that of Abel Abel's
[1:16:01] blood was crying unto God from the
[1:16:03] ground but here's the blood of the Son
[1:16:04] of God Amen crying out at the Throne of
[1:16:07] God what is that blood crying out it's
[1:16:10] crying out your testimony he is crying
[1:16:12] out what you confess he is the high
[1:16:14] priest of our confession so whenever I'm
[1:16:17] saying I'm speaking my voice is speaking
[1:16:20] through the blood at the Throne of
[1:16:22] almighty God amen you got to realize you
[1:16:25] got a voice at the throne amen amen at
[1:16:28] the throne in the presence of God your
[1:16:31] voice speaking through that blood amen
[1:16:34] what you're
[1:16:35] confessing I am healed by his stripes I
[1:16:38] am healed then eny sitting there oh she
[1:16:41] did this and he did that but the blood
[1:16:43] said oh they're forgiven the blood
[1:16:45] saying they're they're forgiven amen the
[1:16:47] blood saying I paid it all I paid the
[1:16:50] price they're forgiven amen oh the the
[1:16:53] accuser of the Brethren there day and
[1:16:56] night accusing us before God the blood
[1:16:59] your testimony and the blood amen crying
[1:17:03] out Mercy Mercy Mercy amen they are
[1:17:07] forgiven praise God they are healed
[1:17:09] Hallelujah they are
[1:17:11] delivered ammen thank God you have a
[1:17:14] representation Before the Throne we're
[1:17:16] sitting together in Heavenly places in
[1:17:18] Christ Jesus amen we're crying out that
[1:17:20] blood praise God Amen remember Prophet
[1:17:23] God said amen that he said God's not
[1:17:27] looking at you
[1:17:29] amen what's he looking at he's looking
[1:17:32] at your sacrifice he's looking at the
[1:17:34] sacrifice he said if you can find
[1:17:36] anything wrong with the sacrifice but
[1:17:38] there's your sacrifice Jesus Christ I
[1:17:41] mean representing you before the throne
[1:17:43] amen so your testimony the blood of
[1:17:46] Jesus Christ amen making the difference
[1:17:48] in the message why brother R says and be
[1:17:52] and because sin broke the blood cell and
[1:17:55] let out that spirit of God that fell on
[1:17:57] the day of Pentecost now the worshipper
[1:18:00] when he puts his hand upon the lamb and
[1:18:02] receives forgiveness of his sin the life
[1:18:05] that was in the lamb which is God's own
[1:18:09] life comes back to the believer and he
[1:18:12] becomes a Son of God Sons and Daughters
[1:18:15] of God then he's the in the family of
[1:18:17] God Amen so amen there it is that life
[1:18:20] that was in the blood amen it comes back
[1:18:22] the spirit of God comes back Upon Us
[1:18:25] amen and and in 1 Corinthians the 6th
[1:18:27] chapter the 20th verse says for ye are
[1:18:30] bought with the price therefore glorify
[1:18:32] God in your body and your spirit which
[1:18:34] are gods have me so you've been paid for
[1:18:36] in the message the token brother bam
[1:18:38] said it's alive now making Vindication
[1:18:41] and because he is we have the right of
[1:18:44] all he purchased for us a man that's got
[1:18:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or a woman
[1:18:50] that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:51] has a right to everything that Jesus
[1:18:54] purchased for us to that's the sign that
[1:18:57] we have that's the buying power praise
[1:19:00] God Amen so he bought a because you
[1:19:02] become a Son of God the blood amen the
[1:19:04] life that was in his blood amen it comes
[1:19:06] on you it gives you rights to everything
[1:19:09] he purchased for
[1:19:11] youmen so I can't say well listen I
[1:19:14] deserve peace I can't say it's because I
[1:19:18] deserve Joy can't say it's because I
[1:19:20] deserve eternal life it's not because I
[1:19:22] say I deserve Health it's because what
[1:19:24] he purchased for me amen I have a right
[1:19:29] to that praise God Amen unto what he has
[1:19:32] bought for me everything that Jesus
[1:19:33] purchased for us you have a right to
[1:19:35] that Satan don't want you to have any of
[1:19:38] it Satan wants to take all of it away
[1:19:41] from you if you'll let him if you'll sit
[1:19:44] back and do nothing he'll take
[1:19:46] everything away from you but you've got
[1:19:48] to resist him your testimony through the
[1:19:51] blood of Jesus Christ and amen has got
[1:19:53] to be a witness amen Ephesians the the
[1:19:56] first chapter amen the 13th verse says
[1:19:59] in whom you also trusted after that you
[1:20:01] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[1:20:03] our salvation of your salvation in whom
[1:20:05] also that after you believed you were
[1:20:07] sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:20:10] Promise which is the earnest of our
[1:20:12] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:20:15] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:20:17] his glory amen so here it is I mean you
[1:20:19] you're sealed by that Spirit we know
[1:20:22] that
[1:20:23] amen and not only that amen but it
[1:20:24] becomes it's just an Earnest of what
[1:20:26] belongs to you amen of until you're R
[1:20:29] till the Redemption till we're out of
[1:20:31] here it's going to be so much better
[1:20:33] it's going to be so much greater than
[1:20:35] what we have here what we're going
[1:20:36] through here what we the best day here
[1:20:38] will never compare Amen to to what we're
[1:20:41] going to have there amen so amen he's
[1:20:44] purchased for us Romans the 8th chapter
[1:20:46] I'm I've got a lot of scripture I'm
[1:20:47] going fast I'm just about to get this
[1:20:49] thing done Romans the 8th chapter give
[1:20:51] me just a few more minutes the 16th
[1:20:53] verse he the spirit itself beareth
[1:20:56] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:20:59] children of God and if children then HS
[1:21:03] HS of God and join HS with Jesus this
[1:21:05] way you suffer with him that we may also
[1:21:07] be glorified together amen so amen we
[1:21:09] become HS amen that you see what belongs
[1:21:12] to him amen it we become joint HS of
[1:21:15] that we become HS of God the things of
[1:21:17] God Amen so that's what Satan wants to
[1:21:19] take away from he don't want to take
[1:21:21] away from you a a a a nice little piece
[1:21:23] of property out here in the
[1:21:25] desert he's got greater aim than that
[1:21:28] he's got a greater desire than that am
[1:21:30] mean he wants to take away your your
[1:21:32] salvation or he wants to take away your
[1:21:34] joy your strength amen these things is
[1:21:36] what he's trying to do so we see here
[1:21:39] amen that according to that scripture we
[1:21:42] read in Deuteronomy the 19th Chapter the
[1:21:43] 15th verse that one witness amen cannot
[1:21:47] bring establish a fact against another
[1:21:50] but it has to be by the mouth of two
[1:21:53] witnesses amen or by the mouth of three
[1:21:56] Witnesses shall every matter be
[1:21:58] established and so here's
[1:22:01] Satan making a claim against you that
[1:22:05] he's trying to take what belongs to you
[1:22:07] your
[1:22:08] testimony amen that's
[1:22:10] one the
[1:22:12] blood is two Hallelujah the spirit
[1:22:17] itself beareth
[1:22:19] witness with us amen that we we are the
[1:22:23] children of God that's three in the
[1:22:26] mouth of two are three Witnesses amen
[1:22:29] let every matter be established amen so
[1:22:32] the devil is defeated because one but
[1:22:34] your testimony has got to be first
[1:22:36] you've got to be the first one to say
[1:22:37] hey I confess it I'm confessing what
[1:22:40] Jesus Christ amen not what my mind says
[1:22:42] about me not what I feel amen but what
[1:22:45] the word of God says about me I'm
[1:22:47] confessing the word of God because if
[1:22:49] you went by your feelings you'll always
[1:22:51] be defeated amen right if you go by what
[1:22:55] you think you'll always be
[1:22:57] defeated but if you go by what the word
[1:22:59] of God says about you amen that is your
[1:23:03] confession and your confession you
[1:23:05] confess the word of God it is comes
[1:23:07] through the blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:23:09] high priest of our profession amen and
[1:23:12] then amen that blood that we are
[1:23:14] believing in the light is in that blood
[1:23:16] the witness of the spirit the spirit is
[1:23:18] witnessing amen that yes amen that one
[1:23:21] belongs to me that one is mine amen they
[1:23:24] don't belong to the devil they're mine
[1:23:27] praise God hallelujah amen so in the
[1:23:29] mouth of two or three Witnesses let
[1:23:31] every word be established
[1:23:34] now winding this down real quickly here
[1:23:37] we started off in 2 Kings the 8th
[1:23:39] chapter the shite woman and she comes
[1:23:42] before the king and she's crying out
[1:23:45] there for what was hers what belonged to
[1:23:49] her and just so happened there was the
[1:23:52] servant there that says
[1:23:54] hey you know that's the woman she's the
[1:23:58] one that's her right there amen that her
[1:24:01] son was restored to life and so forth
[1:24:03] and the King gave her audience but the
[1:24:06] king didn't stop with just giving her an
[1:24:08] audience he said in that sixth verse it
[1:24:11] says in that 2 Kings 8 chapter 6 verse
[1:24:13] said he said so the king appointed unto
[1:24:16] her a certain officers say restore
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:20] all Hallelujah
[1:24:23] that was hers now listen you may have
[1:24:26] allowed the enemy to take something away
[1:24:27] from you but the king says restore
[1:24:31] all that was hers yeah you may have lost
[1:24:35] it you might have temporarily vacated it
[1:24:38] and the enemy has come in and encroached
[1:24:40] upon it the enemy is coming in and
[1:24:42] trying to adversely possess it but the
[1:24:45] king's got the final
[1:24:47] say thank God we serve the King right
[1:24:51] amen hallelujah amen so the king says
[1:24:54] restore all that was hers and all the
[1:24:57] fruits of the field since the day that
[1:25:00] she left the land even unto now in other
[1:25:02] words I want you to go back over the
[1:25:04] seven years she left seven years ago and
[1:25:06] whatever her property would have
[1:25:08] produced over that seven-year period
[1:25:10] that she was gone amen I want you to
[1:25:12] give that to her as well now how do you
[1:25:14] beat that what a deal that is right amen
[1:25:16] that's pretty good right amen so here it
[1:25:19] is the king is interceding on her behalf
[1:25:22] that she receive amen what she had lost
[1:25:26] and more and that's what God is able to
[1:25:28] do for us amen because every one of us
[1:25:30] every one of us know that someplace in
[1:25:32] our life we've given up things that we
[1:25:35] shouldn't have given up that's right
[1:25:37] maybe maybe some of you of your children
[1:25:39] are not here with you tonight maybe
[1:25:42] maybe there's one that's out in the
[1:25:43] world or whatever that youve the enemy's
[1:25:46] com and snatch that child let me tell
[1:25:47] you something God can restore that
[1:25:51] child you claim that amen you claim that
[1:25:55] right under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:25:56] you profess it you claim it amen that it
[1:25:59] belongs to you amen that that's a son
[1:26:01] your a Son of God or a daughter of God
[1:26:03] you claim that amen and God is able to
[1:26:05] restore that God is able to take away or
[1:26:09] to restore all that the enemy took away
[1:26:11] he's able to restore all that the Palmer
[1:26:13] worm and the the caterpillar a the
[1:26:17] Locust all that they destroyed our God
[1:26:20] restores that's the thing that he does
[1:26:21] and so the enemy may have been working
[1:26:23] in your life to try to steal something
[1:26:26] away from
[1:26:27] you let God do the restoring work let
[1:26:30] God show you amen but you know how you
[1:26:33] started you started with your testimony
[1:26:35] your confession that this is mine yeah I
[1:26:39] made a mistake yeah I I I I I got out of
[1:26:41] church I did this I did that but you let
[1:26:44] God do the work of restoration in your
[1:26:46] life now I I want to close I want to go
[1:26:49] back to where we started over there in 1
[1:26:50] Peter the 5th chapter where it says says
[1:26:52] be sober be vigilant because your
[1:26:54] adversary the devil as a or line seeking
