if the source of my ambition is the treasure I'll obtain if I measure my successes on a scale of Earthly gain if the focus of my vision is the status I'll attain my accomplishments are worthless and my efforts are in vain so I lay aside these trophies to pursue a higher crown and should you choose somehow to use the life I willingly lay down I surrender all the Triumph for it's only by your grace I relinquish all the glory I surrender all the praise I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams though the price to follow cost me everything I surrender all my human soul desires is sacrifice

the entire day since this morning and even now tonight appreciate all of you and may the Lord just bless you praise His name and brother Oscar that song was in my heart you the goodness of God Amen praise the Lord I want to read from verses uh let me see here quickly verse 6 Jeremiah 32 and: 6 the Bible says and Jeremiah said the word of the Lord came unto me saying behold hanil the son of Shalom thine uncles th thine Uncle shall come unto thee saying bu thee my field that is in anth for the right of redemption is in thy hand to buy it and so Hil my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord and said unto me by my field I pray thee that that is in anod which is in the country of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the Redemption is thine buy it for thyself then I knew that this was the word of the Lord yeah and I bought the field of haam Anil my uncle's son that was in anot and weighed him the money even 17 shekels of silver 17 is always the number of a system change something always happens silver speak speaks of redemption and I subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took Witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances and so I took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom take note and that which was open and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Barak the son of narah the son of messiah in the sight of Hamil my uncle's son in the presence of of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison and I charged Barack before them saying look at how he changed now this is no longer custom this is now going into prophecy thus sayth the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open put them in an earn vessel and make and and that it may continue many days for thus say the Lord of hosts the god of Israel houses and Fields and Vineyards shall be possessed in this land again may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our hearts father we thank you Lord Jesus for coming our way father giving us Lord this great book father the word oh God that comes from the mind of God the thoughts of god father any man can pick up the Rema word and not have the logos so I pray tonight May the logos come behind the Rema May the logos the thought of God be expressed behind this written word and spoken word tonight and may God make it real in the heart of your children bless us bless our gathering and father may we say like those of AAS did not our heart burn within us Wy he had spake with us we give you honor and we invite you here father we ask for your blessing upon your word hide me behind this cross Lord Jesus may not I be seen but may Christ be seen in Jesus name amen may take your seats tonight God Rich bless you praise be to God let may go semi-automatic and then we'll we'll change weapons as we go along so I I I'd like to just uh take a quotation tonight if you will allow me to do that Gabriel Gabriel's instruction to Daniel and I want you to see how brother renam puts this and he takes exactly Jeremiah 32 and: 6 and he says his cousin hail was left him some hair and they were going into captivity which we're going into with him this morning captivity and it was kept in an Earthly vessel look how brother bam puts it it was kept in an Earthly vessel is that shows where the power of God the Scrolls and the secrets of God is known in the heart but then the prophet goes further he says our Plan of Redemption the same being kept in Earthly vels starts off singular now he goes to plural Jesus's name and the Revelation now you might look at that quotation and you might just browse over it quickly but I I think brother Benham left us a real clue there tonight that we can look at this same evidences in the Earthly vessels so if you allow me to speak tonight I'd like to speak on the mystery of the open and the sealed evidence The Mystery of the open and the sealed evidence tonight now brother B says in the message job he says now Redemption he says God has a way of redemption and he says redeem means to be brought back to the right place or the right position now if I throw this cloth down on the floor and take another cloth from the chair that would be replacement yeah is that right and not Redemption right but to redeem Dre is to pick up that same cloth and put it back on the table that means there is no replacement for a Son of God Amen there's nobody that can take my place tonight oh that should already just give you such a such a peace that there's nobody that can take my chair tonight that chair that I'm sitting on tonight had my name on it before the world even began before it was even manufactured my name was written on that chair and so there's no replacement for me tonight can we say praise the Lord so when we look at Joseph how that Joseph we call him the dreamer the Bible calls him the dreamer his brothers called him the dreamer but Joseph only had two dreams only two dreams and that two dreams is really just one dream just different descriptions of of what God was going to do in the life of Joseph but I believe that we should look always at scripture and look at our portion in that scripture we should look at our part It's good to anoint you know and see brother brenham's part but you have a part too because if there was no you there was no need to send Elijah the prophet but because there was you God had to send Elijah the prophet can we say Amen so Joseph had these two dreams and he said the first dream was he said I saw amen we were binding sheath in the field he says and I saw my sheath look at the Bible language arose I saw my sheath arose he said and I saw the other Sheep amen doing obeisance to my sheath right amen and his brothers hated him for that dream then he had a second dream and the dream was he said I saw the sun the moon and the stars doing obeisance to me and his father said to him Joseph what type of a dream is this do you think that me your mother your brothers are all going to bow down to you oh my and his father observed that dream and I think we should observe that too because it's not only dealing with Israel natural but God is showing a mystery that he saw amen his family in the field and the same family he saw in the heavens God is going to take us from the field into the heavens the same family in the Earth is going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and that family is going to put on the immortality hallelujah it's called Redemption it's called a way of redemption God has a plan of redemption tonight and let me tell you God is not going to fail I said God is not going to fail governments can fail we can fail hallelujah amen but God cannot fail that's one thing he cannot do he cannot fail and God cannot lose you tonight if he loses you he loses his thoughts that's right and God cannot lose his thoughts because you are part of him amen praise be to God so let's look at this quickly for a for a minute here as we look at Jeremiah in captivity now Jeremiah was shut up in prison because of his prophecy amen Israel didn't accept the prophecy of Elijah of Jeremiah and so they've taken him to prison yet Jeremiah said that you're going to be Amen in captivity for seven decades but God said there will be a restoration houses and Vineyards and Fields will be possessed again you see that's the way God works sometimes he'll allow us and he'll give us a little chastisement or little trial or whatever he'll allow us to get away he'll allow things to happen but with a promise of restoration hallelujah hallelujah that's the God that I serve tonight he's the god of restoration he's the god that makes a way when there seems to be no way he will make a way in the time of trouble praise His holy name so here he's in prison and as he sits there the Lord says to him thus say the Lord he says your uncle's son is going to bring come to you and sell your person of land he says because you have the right of redemption I want you to notice that though he was in prison his rights could not be stripped from him come on hallu that's powerful tonight although he was in a certain condition the enemy could not take away his right of redemption oh friends I want you to be encouraged tonight that though we are sometimes in a circumstance in a situation or some kind of a battle the enemy cannot take away your right of redemption hallelujah amen he can lock you up he can do certain things he can take away he can let you be scorned he can let you be mocked but there's one thing he cannot take away is that predestinated seed he cannot take that away from you before Jeremiah went to to prison he already had Redemption he already had the right oh I I I I feel religious tonight let me take out my machine gun listen no preacher can give you Redemption they can preach it to you but you haded before we even preached to [Applause] you and I'm going to say this respectfully not even William brandham gave you Redemption he came to Quicken you he came to Enlighten you he told you what you have amen but he didn't bring Redemption he came to tell us that you have it to begin with before you came here you already a Son of God now listen friends your flesh might not be redeemed but you have redeemed Soul you've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah before we came here we came with the right of [Applause] redemption Hallelujah ohjah that feels good tonight to know that even if the devil puts us in a certain trial or a certain situation there's something he can't take away is your right to your inheritance Hallelujah and notice Jeremiah's fight didn't come from without it came from within that's where most of your trouble is going to come from it's going to come from within your fight is not going to come from from Africa your fight is not going to come from somewhere your fight is going to come from those that is around you amen that's where our fight starts but praise be to God it's a good fight of Faith because he promised never to leave us he promised never to forsake us hallah he promised to be in us right until the end of time Hallelujah now they tried to discredit Jeremiah I'm just laying a foundation they tried to discredit Jeremiah's message because they were think think is going to influence too many people but you know what once Jeremiah spoke that word could not return void because when a prophet speaks amen and God gives a word for that day and God gives a word for that age nobody can stop that no devil can stop whatever God has spoken let me tell you Satan has got experience and he's got an experience that when God speaks it will not return unto him void but it shall accomplish the purpose it sent forth to do so when God said let there be light the devil was there he saw the light coming into existence when God said that Noah's going to build an ark and the Ark will not be drowned amen Satan was there to see it happen the devil has got experience but his experience is that whatever God speaks it's going to happen and God says there will be a bride tonight without spot without wrinkle there will be a church amen it depends on how you look at yourself tonight and I want you to anoint your faith amen and look at amen what you are and so that you can have confidence in where you are going to tonight once you can see where you come from then you can have confidence in where you are going to praise his mighty name oh Hallelujah the devil cannot strip you from your rights amen they can take jerem put him on a YouTube channel they can take Jeremiah and put him on some YouTube prison but let me tell you whatever Jeremiah spoken you cannot reverse that Hallelujah no matter what you tried to do to Jeremiah the word has already left the mouth of the [Applause] Prophet hallelujah amen because it's spoken praise be to God now brother B says never in the world was God's messenger ever received by the Ecclesiastes never they won't receive God's prophets you know why because they have to brother uses the term they have to stay true to form how they've been taught what the church says what the bishop says what what what the system says and they'll go against what God saids because they don't want to recognize God's Prophet for the hour but let me tell you friends we didn't come to be seen or to be heard God's Prophet don't come Hallelujah to to to have some people worship him not for one minute do I bring any attention to myself the prophet says but I've come to establish a relationship between men and [Applause] gods can we say Amen never in the world was God's messenger ever received by the Ecclesiastes you think they received Elijah in the Old Testament they never received him friends you know why they never received Elijah it's because Elijah said I'm going to close the heavens and the Earth for 3 years and he closed it up and they thought Ah that's just a little prophecy they never took Elijah serious because he just closed up the Heavens what else can he do amen they never saw that this was God's Prophet for the hour because he only shut the heavens that's all he did but then God said to him go to I've opened up another door for you there is a wiow woman in zapet whom I have commanded you see friends that's the unwritten amen I don't read where God has ever spoken to this woman but go God says I've already commanded her to take care of you you see God works on both ends Hallelujah and when Elijah came to her he said to her I'll fix me I don't know why I'm going into this but he said to her fix me something to eat she says sir I'm only I've only got a little meal and a little oil and I'm going to make something for my son and I and we're going to die but this is going to be the last supper it's going to be the last supper I'm just going to eat and die after this he says well Bak for me first and the Bible says a she went he said thus sayth the Lord th Cruise will not run dry amen but there will be meal and there will be oil in your house and brother as she went into the house she started pouring out but there's oil there's meal there's enough to be sustained why she had something to accept what God's Prophet [Applause] said I read the scripture I don't read her repenting while the meal and the oil was multiplied I don't read her saying I'm now in the message God has sent me a prophet I don't read that with the signs and with the Wonders and with the miracle in a kitchen I don't read her saying God sent a prophet but then God allowed her son to die and now she says listen have you come to re to to to remind me of my sins then the sunay and Elijah says I don't know because God don't reveal Everything To His prophets and Elijah says give him to me he takes the boy he goes up to the lift listen here a little room in the house a little square box room in the house and he takes the boy he gives no explanation she asks no questions that's how you should be in the message you don't need explanation you don't need Hallelujah to be questioning all you have to do is believe that whatever happens in that little room is going to be third P power hallelujah hallelujah are you ready tonight and he went up into the room and when he came back he prayed for the boy three times and when he came back now she had something to bring a Revival to her now she said now I know that you are a prophet of God what signs and wonders and the Miracles in the kitchen she didn't have that but when the quickening power came when when the third pool power came now she said now I know you see once you come in contact with that third pool power once the word is being revealed to you once the message is open to you nobody can take it away from you yes amen I hope you hear me well tonight amen I said to brother on somebody said back home once you see the message if I'm a witness and I've seen an accident and I've seen something happen nobody can tell me I did not see amen amen you might have your opinion you might have your own thing but I can tell you what I've witnessed and once you see the message nobody can let you unsee the message so if you leave and say this is not the message that means you've never seen it because you cannot unsee what you've seen that's right praise be to God I'm ready to preach tonight I'm warming up Hallelujah now this woman has a Revival now she says I know that you're a prophet she never said that with the meal and the oil you see while she was being fed while she was just being fed in the house she didn't say those things but now she's saying when she sees resurrection power when she sees the third pool manifestation when you see all these things are happening now she's say I know that you are a prophet because in the next chapter is the Mount carel Showdown yeah and in the mount Carl Showdown Elijah's asking how long will you be Hal between two opinions and in Elijah's prayer he says father let this people know that you are God and that I am their Prophet That's The Showdown friends to know that that's our Lord out there and that he has sent a prophet that's the showdown in this hour oh are you ready for that tonight Hallelujah brother M says you can kill the messenger but you can never kill his message thank I said you can kill the messenger but you can never kill the message brother man says though Steven was killed and he was seen at the right hand of the father he said his message still lingered on I like the way the prophet puts it he said Steven's message still lingered on because Paul spoke about it are you hearing me tonight friends our Prophet might could be here but the message is still lingering on we still speaking about it he's been off the scene for so many years but we are still speaking about it you know why because the message is eternal [Applause] life it comes from the Eternal one it's like I said many people can pick up this word this is Rema word yeah this is Rema it's written spoken right but logos is the thoughts behind the Rema so a lot of people can have the Rema word they can preach denomination have the Rema word every denomination can have Rema word but not everybody can have logos because logos is the mind of God and that's why you needed a prophet to say good morning friends I'm here this morning to tell you what was in the mind of God here's the Locos coming the thoughts behind the words are you ready amen amen you can kill the messenger but you cannot kill his message amen I think these people are a bit too late they think they've put uh Jeremiah on a YouTube jail a YouTube prison and and a internet prison and put him up there and put him on display hey Jeremiah Jeremiah says you can do whatever you want to this body but what left my mouth is is the words that I speak they are spirit and they are life amen Hallelujah are you ready tonight so I want you to see this quickly because it's important that before Hil could come to Jeremiah well let me go back I I feel the pull on that Elijah let me stop quickly there and Elijah said to them let's go up on Mount carel let's call upon God for how long will it be halt between two opinions and they came up to Amen brother even ever proud and they called 450 Bale prophets called upon their gods now you see the reason why their God could not come because there was actually none did you hear what I said tonight and the reason why there was no fire is because these Bale prophets they used to make artificial fire and let the worshippers come in and they would bring the fire and oh it would be up in the in the idol and they would say oh pale Answers by fire B so Elijah challenged them by what they were deceived with and so on this day he says now bring your fire bring your God and the Bible says they cried they cried the whole day and there was no voice you see the church nominal there's no voice friends but in the days of the voice of the Seven Angels when he begins to sound the mystery of God should be finished we have a voice and we have a scriptural voice with a scriptural sign too hallelujah oh friends and before Elijah uh he he took he took 12 Stones and when he took those 12 Stones he pecked them remember he he never he never built a new altar it was the very altar restored because it's the hour of restoration so he took 12 Stones which represent the 12 tribes of Israel so he took up those 12 Stones he picked up those stones and he called upon the Lord and he says father let them know this day that you are God and that I am his Prophet God had to answer by fire oh friends Hallelujah God came right down and licked up the water amen consumed the sacrifice and even in the trenches that's the God that I serve because we don't have a painted fire our services are not painted Services we don't have to make you and whoop you up tonight Hallelujah you see you'll only get that from a prostitute because you cannot be a prostitute and a virgin at the same time a prostitute will give you service and after that she'll ask you for money but not a virgin so the mother harot and her daughters will give service and then they'll push their hand out and says now give us the money s a seed not in the message of the hour oh friend the seed is not money the seed is the words amen can we say Amen tonight Hallelujah I began to look at that brother Ron Elijah had 12 Stones and he pck those 12 Stones went to the Book of Matthew I found out the Lord Jesus Took the fish and the bread he broke the bread multiplied the bread and when they were done they picked up 12 baskets of fragments full of baskets 12 baskets full of fragments but then if you go further into the Book of Mark there is seven baskets left in one place there's 12 12 in the other place there seven the 12 is for the 12 tribes of Israel but the seven that's for us because we had a Ministry of Elijah he can't take the 12 Stones he has to take up seven stones and show us from Genesis to Revelation and bring amen proper worship back to the church again for the father seeketh such that will worship Him in spirit and in truth tonight Hallelujah you see brother Brian amen did Elijah pick up 12 Stones yes amen so our Elijah cannot pick up 12 because he's not sent to the Jews he's a gentile prophet he picked up seven baskets why did he pick up because he's here to tie up the Loose Ends fragments a little bit here and a little bit there here a little there precept upon precept line upon line hall we don't eat from 12 baskets we eat from Seven baskets for don't put things in the Bible for us just to read it friends it has [Applause] meaning if we have Elijah then we must have a restoration can we say Amen tonight Hallelujah I want you to see your Hill comes and haam says this land means nothing to me there's no value let us just you know sell it take it buy it from me it has no value friends some people will be in the message and the message will have be no value to them some people will see the message and they look into it says this man calls me a vulture but when we read and we pick up the spoken word we about the same man oh friends the same man calls me an eagle we see the value in it hallelujah praise His wonderful name I want you to see here quickly so Elijah and I'm just going to run just skip a few things Jeremiah he says I called my Uncle my uncle came and we sold and then what we did is we had a little deal going on in this parcel of land and so I knew that there's going to be a restoration I know I'm not going to live in it right now but I'll come back and live on it do you hear what I'm saying he had a right to live on this land but he was going to bypass the land but he's going to come right back into the land catch that friends you have a land when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I have another body that I get into I bypass the land but I have a promise that I'm coming right back to the I have the right to get into my body I have the right to begin with but I bypassed my theophany and I came here to be tried and to be tested but when it's all said and done and Babylon is destroyed I'm getting back into my body again yes sir H friends you had a right to go into your theop body but because of the Garden of Eden you bypass that land you byass that inheritance but God has a promise that you'll step into that body when you recognize this message to be Eagle food you've heard from your theophany Hallelujah all right so there they sitting they're having a council meeting and here is according to the customs they had to write can I borrow a pen yeah I'm going to subscribe all these things Jeremiah 32 bought on this day this thing that land so many squares so many acres I don't know what do you guys call it Acres so many acus witness sign it brother sign it Elder Sign it Jeremiah sign it I've subscribed the one now I have to subscribe the other one too Jeremiah this day this day bought the land by ha Uncle son sign it sign it Elder Sign it everybody sign it now I have the same thing on this paper and I have the same on this paper this is what we called the two evidences right what's on this paper is on this paper but what I want you to do is take the one evidence seal it up can we do that I took this I didn't steal it I took it from Brother Ron's office and I took a seal I took tape from his office and I'm going to seal this evidence watch Friends what am I going to do everybody come on let's talk here tonight the quicker you talk the quicker you go home you have a what evidence and you have a what evidence the one is what and the other one is the one is and the other one is you have two evidences so he says take the evidence and put it in an earn vessel according to that quote the prophet says all of us have these evidences in our ear vessels so let's let's idle a little bit now we getting to preach watch friends so the one is the other one is now if we look at the open evidence it's left for tempering you hearing me tonight so anybody has access to the open evidence they can see Jeremiah bought it on such and such a day he bought it from ha while I was in prison Elders signed it Deacon signed it truste signed it we all signed it while we were in a prison Court Hallelujah this is left for tempering that means everybody can scratch out Jeremiah's name they can change the dates they can take out a signature and they can put another signature when the open evidence they can do whatever they want to do it because it can fall into anybody's hands everybody can handle the open evidence but nobody oh you're not hearing me tonight we should have been raising this roof nobody can put their hands on the sealed evidence only the rightful [Applause] owner I'm ready to preach sealed evidence open evidence it can go from Men to Men yeah Church to church amen City to city and anybody can scretch out things I'm going to scratch out Jeremiah's name I'm going to make it Neema change the Jade to a to n n n e h I think I can't spell still J my changing it a little bit change his name a little bit amen so that I can deceive brother Ron so brother Ron cannot see that this is really Jeremiah's it's supposed to be Nehemiah Hallelujah you see this open evidence Satan has [Applause] access it's in your earn vessel and so the devil has access to the open evidence that's in your life he can bring all kinds of things and and temper with you but there's one thing he can't temper that's a seal evidence oh Church yes sir brother and sister when there was a conference in heaven and they asked have you considered my servant job oh the devil said yes I've been to his church I've been to his house he loves prayer meetings praise praise praise he prays all the time says well if you don't keep him and seal him up like that he'll curse you to your face and die and the Lord says well go and try him and so the devil went to his children went to his wife he says but whatever you do devil you cannot touch the sealed evidence that Soul belongs to me you see the devil can temple with all kinds of things but there's one thing he cannot take away and that's that soul that that Gene of God that comes from God the devil cannot take away that from you you know why because you come from God and you are going back to God again the I'm loading up tonight Hallelujah and while job was sitting there the devil started tempering with him brought some sickness in his life brought some diseases in his life took away business took away things it's the open evidence but then job sat on an Airship Hallelujah and job said I know oh friendsall there should come a time in your life where you shouldn't look at the open evidence look at what you were how God saw you before the foundation of the world I am sealed until the day of [Applause] redemption can we go on I need a few more examples and I'm ready to shoot come on here's Rahab oh friends let's just pick up rahab's open evidence and just bring her up before you quickly let's look at her open evidence prostitute good for nothing Amen brother man says her parents put her into prostitution yes sir and then brother bam says oh but you know what when she heard the message when she heard she wasn't there when it when when Moses opened up the Red Sea she wasn't there when the Mana fell she's never seen the pillar of fire in a life but she believed she's never seen the cloud in life but here comes the word made flesh Joshua here comes the ministry under Joshua commission and here's the two spies going over she says I've heard you fought two battles now you're coming to fight the third battle amen there's an interval there's an interval she said I want a true token she said I've been with the general I went with the president I went with the bishop amen the pope knows me too oh come on Church don't be quiet on me some of you sitting like you don't know what what where do you love friends those things exist Hallelujah she said I've been with all the men I've been with this preacher I've been with this preacher I went with this personality she said I want a true token this time everybody gave me some kind of a token but I want a true token this time and token is coming without sensation yes sir the baptism of the Holy Ghost the sealed evidence without [Applause] sensation filthy life huh if we must judge sister reab would she be part of this message if we must judge sister RAB we can say sister you don't long here just like you know like the Pharisees did you know if you knew who this was you know you'd God bless her like this you know some of you are like that I know he sitting so quiet tonight and you think no I don't do that yeah just God bless because you've got some Vaseline intent of care or Vaseline intensive care so you don't want to touch the brother's cheick because just in case you know on Amen help us tonight amen because you know what we're looking at the open evidence this can't be my sister she should be a virgin bride even the devil R up off because according to the devil scripture there should be a virgin conceiving Hallelujah but according Hallelujah to the Lord he can use anybody who he wants to [Applause] use so while the devil was looking at the Virgin shall conceive God used The Prostitute to bring forth Jesse Jesse brings forth David David brings for Solomon and this token is going to bring her into a marriage I said this token is going to bring her into a marriage Hallelujah and that's why when they gave her the seal which is now the token amen the devil could shake and uh the devil could shake everybody else and he could come and tempt everybody else but once she heard the message Satan could not come back to her again she's coming into a marriage can we say praise the Lord praise the Lord she's coming into a marriage Hallelujah the token brings you into a marriage and it's coming without sensation friends hallelujah amen amen you're not going based on somebody else's standard you know you might say you know brother brother so and so got it that way I felt it here other one say I felt yeah I said I felt it on my toes and friends this you don't have to feel it yeah and feel it there and feel it there it's an knowing it's an annoying you will know that you know that you know and nobody can take that away from me can we say praise the Lord the Lord hallelujah oh let's go on Friends RAB came in without sensation because she was the the sealed evidence to bring forth Solomon without re there is no Solomon let's go further I began to write a few things down brother brother Ron before I came I looked at how the devil can even come to your flesh and and come to the open evidence because your flesh is an open evidence the devil can come to your flesh it's an open evidence he can even come into your spirit it's an open evidence but something that cannot break is the soul right so you can't be sitting there and says if I've got the holy goes I can't get sick no friends he can still come in the open [Applause] evidence is that right something must take you out yes something must take you out if you going into the Rapture it's either the Rapture that are quickening power is going to come on you might die before the Rapture but something must put you in come on come on are you ready so here's Isaac and Isaac and Rebecca they get married and as they get married they they Rebecca says I need some I need some you know fruits of the marriage manifestation one children husband says and I am I God to give you children she said uh I I I came in here to for marriage and for for fruits manifestation it must be fruits of the union he says well let's pray let's see how God and she conceived and in her as twins there's a part that I can't understand brother on know God must explain to me one day these two boys starts fighting in the mother's womb they don't even have eyes yet how do you fight with no arms yet I can't understand that God must explain to me that but the Bible says there was a fight within a womb and even when Esau came out the Bible says Jacob had his hand on his heel I can't understand that did that boy even see what doesn't know what a heel is he grabbed him on the heel but you see what friends it's because there was a predestinated seed in him for the birthright so before he was born he was already given the birth right or the right to inheritance Hallelujah you didn't catch that before he left his mother's womb he already had the right to his [Applause] inheritance sirj grabbed the on the heel or grab him on the heel and I can imagine how that horse ISO did it brother who leave me alone and the mother other knew that the older Shall Serve the younger and then the process of a Time came it's time now to release the blessing and here comes the mother to the boy that she knows has the right to The Inheritance he has the right to the blessing she tells him hey boy it's time to wake up you see why you need Church some of you think you don't need Church you need a mother Church to tell you not Catholic Church mother Church come to church church is a woman and here you're going to get your instruction you have the right to your inheritance and then she he goes he says now listen here go to your dad and deceive him you'll know how to do it I don't need to tell you you're born with that are you ready for it he goes to his father the mother prepares the pot as the mother repairs the pot she gives him the pot he goes into Isaac and the Bible says Isaac's eyes was dim he couldn't see clearly amen he said who's there it's me ISO father says huh you sound like Jacob I I I come closer I can't see you I can't hear you you properly come closer let me feel you when he when he was feeling brother can I touch you is it okay I'm a man eh he started feeling him he said you feel like Esau eyesight heing touching they says come closer let me you're smelling good bro you smell like your so hearing seeing touching smelling he says bring me the pot let me taste now five senses the open evidence the devil can deceive you on the open evidence all five senses is Isaac is deceived all five senses deceived and he says oh this food you can see where ISO gets it from he eats all the food up now it's time to release the blessing that's right and he says come near my son puts his hands upon him he says Lord bless my son give him the blessing that he's laid up for him yes and Jacob just keeps quiet gets the blessing po he's gone ISO comes in daddy where's my blessing he says you you were here a few minutes ago he says no it wasn't me is that Shyer that deceiver was here amen hallelujah the daddy and said Daddy give me a blessing also he says boy I don't have what do you mean you don't have he says boy I I I I I I I don't have it's not of me all that was in Abraham all that Abram gave he gave to me and all that was in me I pour it into Jacob right oh I hope you hear me tonight all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he parted into the church yes sir that blessing was left for Jacob he got it the wrong way but it was his to begin with he had the right to those blessings he had the right to his inheritance he had the right of redemption and nobody could take it there was no replacement for Jacob Hallelujah we come into something Jacob goes he runs away from his brothers he goes to laan long story short it's time for him to leave deceives the father-in-law runs away from the father-in-law deceives him gets some speckled uh uh sheep put something in the water deceive the father this guy this if we must if we must really take this guy's open evidence liar cheater deceiver robber he robs his own boss steals at work it's on the evidence friends that's exactly what Jacob did he stole from his boss right and then he had to run away again shame Jacob is running away again he's on the Run he's on the run and then he meets the angel I said he meets the Angel that's the seven seal friends is when the angel the descending Angel comes down then you must know that's the seven seal friends it's not between you and the angel alone and the scripture says in the book of Isaiah it says that Jacob had power over the angel now friends let me stop there you cannot have power over an angel right physically how you going to defeat an angel bro you think you can wrestle with the angel he'll blow you over you can't wrestle with the angel angel can destroy a whole city so when the scripture says he had power over the angel it's not physical power the power that he had was he reminded the angel of the promise he reminded the angel of the sealed evidence that you are the rightful [Applause] owner let's go further and the angel ask we know who that angel is right we know who that angel is it's Christ friends amen that's my Lord up there what's your name Jacob the angel knew his name but you see based on the open evidence his name was Jacob but you see according to the sealed evidence he must have a name change oh you're not catching what I'm saying tonight you see according to the open evidence his name is Jacob but in this document here his name is Israel so in that earn vessel Jacob there was a open evidence and a sealed evidence there was the Israel in [Applause] Jacob are you ready so the sealed evidence was Israel that's how God works amen this is how it works Hallelujah Jacob ran away now we're coming to Joseph and Joseph as we go along Joseph his brothers hates him he's got this dream and he's got this two dreams which is actually the same dream one dream really twice just different descriptions it's like a prophecy a virgin shall conceive but in the Book of Genesis it says the seed of the woman shall bruise the same thing just a further expression of the same prophecy so here we find out Joseph the brothers take him to put him in a pit and as they put him in a pit they put him in a pit brother and sister after three days they saw the midianites coming they sell him to the midianites and the one said no let's kill him no the other one said no let's not kill him because we don't want blood on his hands but you know what let's kill a kid let's kill a wild animal and let's kill it and let's take the coat and dip it in the blood and let's take the evidence to the father that the son has been killed so they sold him and here they take the coat of many colors not like mine mine doesn't have many colors they DP It in Blood and what happens now the coach goes back to the original owner and while the owner lifts up the coat the guilty boys are standing on the other side of the coat guilt has charged but the father could not see the guilt of their children the father could not see the guilty stains of his sons because the code the evidence was dipped in blood so the father had to look through that blood and when he looked through the blood he saw you spotless virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah God kept it away from Jak from from Israel from J from Israel God kept it away from him Hallelujah God could have showed him if Jacob knew where his son was you think he'd be sitting there he'll go buy him back but you see Joseph was the sealed evidence amen Jacob was the vessel to bring restoration Joseph Joseph was the vessel to bring Redemption Jose was the vessel to store up the food Joseph was the vessel Hallelujah that's going to bring the mind of God for this generation oh friend Hallelujah so we were all guilty we were all guilty that's why I said that evidence had to go back to the father now friends when we look at this we were all trapped Satan had excess and sometimes like myself we we come from different Bloodlines I I I told you the last time I've got Greek in my blood I was born in apollis by birth mom got married to an Naidu and then same father same mother but then my name had to change from a polus to an IDU Indian if I had a choice I wouldn't take that name cuz I don't look like one maybe I do I don't know I certain don't walk like one certainly don't dress like one too so if I look at my birth our birth becomes more mysterious than the Virgin birth because God had to keep you and watch you for 6,000 years because there was a word spoken in Genesis 1: 128 that was saying let replenish and multiply the earth now remember now the prophet says that scripture remained unfulfilled until Jesus was born it remained unfulfilled because that first Adam was supposed to bring forth the second Adam that's why he's called the last Adam and then he was supposed to bring us forth [Music] amen hallelujah but you see because of these evidences we had to go through different test and different things and different problems in our lives but there's one thing that the or orig owner has your name written on it am Hallelujah and that is why brother and sister amen you have the right to every Redemptive blessing that is yours tonight you have the right to be healed Hallelujah you have right to Deliverance you have right to Joy you have right to peace you know why he died for all of those things praise His Wonderful Name Hallelujah the sealed evidence no man could touch it the sealed evident proves who's the rightful owner and I'm going to quickly just push it a little forward John the Revelator he was right there when they crucified Christ was right there he witnessed the whole thing but then he was caught up in a vision brother M says John caught up in the vision he says John was in the vision he says and then John saw the 20 four Elders saw the fall living creatures and then there was a proclamation that we said last night who is worthy to take the book and to loosen the seals thereof John looked around and he said let's check the open evidence let's see who's worthy he started with Adam Adam Adam said br can imagine Adam said don't start with me it started already don't start with me he called Abram Abram he says but I lied twice Joseph I told a white lie David I went with another man's wife in church friends let open evidence come on up don't sit there a w brother I don't it happened in the Bible people are something like can't it happened it's under open evidence it's public information amen yes sir David said but TR Jeremiah Jeremiah said let's call Peter Peter said I I I I had a problem I I curse you know oh come on friends you know this church sits like a bunch of angels here brother on W like you've been born from the I'm Bor fed with the holy ghost from my mother's womb come on friends only John the Baptist had that you didn't have that you said like you've never seen the new brother brother I've also only believe you sound like you're coming oh you were born with the song Only Bel no friends according to the open aidence some of you were [Applause] mafias some of you were robbers some of you were were murderers oh let's bring Moses Moses according to the open evidence can you do it he says BR I killed an Egyptian thank you yeah sit and think let's ask who is worthy yeah some of you sit like I would have been the one oh Lord shame it's good the Lord didn't ask who will I send send me Lord friends our birth disqualified us because we came by our sex birth we heard it this morning according to the open evidence John wept no man no is found worthy according to the open evidence no man is worthy to take the book and to loosen the seals thereof oh my John wept and then one of the elders says John weep notl brother says John was in the vision once you recognize this message to be Eagle food you've heard from your theophany so John saw that he had a land right there John saw that he had a body that he could step into it John saw that he can [Applause] escape am weep not John for the lion of a tribe of Judah he has prevailed to take the sealed evidence rip it open and start calling names you're not hearing me tonight he start calling names now friends I'm not saying when brother says when God calls names he says he's not calling Lil and Bri ID and and this one this one no no no brother says when God calls names he says he makes the people catch the word for that day you catch the Revelation by faith that's your name being called yes sir hallelujah oh friends and when he broke the seals my name has been called the full Holy Ghost has come back to the church now you are sealed until the day of redemption yes praise God and Satan can't touch that sealed evidence hallelujah hallelujah I want to hit the critic a little bit tonight is that okay before I close how long have I been here according to the open evidence how long I know you guys are going to say brother Ron don't get that African back according to the opening evidence all the Africans preach two three hours I hope the Africans don't hear me tonight let me hit the critic a little bit before I close you know brother manam was told to go because the seal is going to be revealed to him and brother vam says I went and every night he says I went home and I studied the open evidence I looked at Clarence locken I look at every preacher how they preached on the seals he says and then somebody came into the room he says when I looked I saw it was the angel of the Lord amen he said to me close that open evidence yes a sealed evidence Hall and every night I studyed the open evidence and every night the angel would come and give me the sealed evidence oh you're not hearing me tonight where's the critics tonight and say brother ROM studied this and he told us about that and he said Clarance and he said this he used this one he said he did yes he did it's public information he said I went to the open evidence and I studied this one I studed that one and the angel said close up that open evidence that's not been revealed yet but there will be a church of brid and every night we got the sealed evidence is that right oh friends that's why I said what I said the book and the blood goes together right you cannot have the book without the blood Jesus Christ says this is the New Testament Testament book In My Blood the book and the blood goes together Hallelujah and I'm so glad tonight that the book became [Applause] flesh and the book had to bleed now we are eating the bleeding word amen [Applause] it's the body word of the son of man and that's why the Bible says wheresoever the ccass is that's where the Eagles will be gathered together hallelujah oh may God help us tonight to look at this quickly that this is your natural birth this is your new birth amen your name Hallelujah has moved from The Book of Life to the Lamb's Book of Life your Nature has been changed without the blood there's no remittance of sin that's why friends when we talk about worshiping God and an open book is when you can look at this and say my sins are gone we were all guilty but thank God he put our name in the blood section of the book before Satan could come your name was sealed he wrote your name and you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world I want to say tonight the book is sealed by the testimony of the blood amen and there's no way that you can be lost I'm not saying you can do what you want because your Works will prove who you are brother M says if you say that I can go out I'm sealed I'm I'm redeemed I'm a bride he says when you have that kind of teaching and that kind of thinking that I'm predestinated he said you never had it in the first place he said but if you can come by Grace tonight that's why every song that is being sung every time a prayer is been offered every time a sermon is being preached put yourself in there we heard this morning you can't leave things in a in a in Doctrine form it has to become personal this is not a doctrinal Christ This is a personal Christ Christ must become real to you musicians come up at this time Satan will temper with your natural life he will don't think that you can oh brother

[Music] you if you look at this open evidence how many times has he been there for you how many times he's been there all the time all my life all my life he's been faithful to me based on this how many times did we get sick has he been good to you how many times did you turn around yes from that deathbed or that accident has he been good to you how many times there was and a satanic altar with your name on it has God been good to [Music] you touch not my son touch not my anointing what you've done unto the Rel of these little ones you've done it unto me God has been faithful to us what do we have to give him just give him your soul tonight give him your life give him your worship the father seeketh such that will worship Him amen for 6,000 years the father was seeking such in heaven having perfect [Music] angels and it was not even perfect worship shouting holy brother M says the Angels could not sing Amazing Grace that's right he said they could not sing Redeeming Grace here we come tonight we look at this open evidence how many times did I fail Lord but he didn't throw me away how many times did we mess up but he's looking at the seal Hallelujah that's why your worship tonight is under an open book because you appreciate the blood of Jesus Christ because the book and the blood goes together your goodness is running after me when I was running away your goodness when I felt I wasn't going to be in this message I'm going to run away your goodness was running after me He's been Faithful Friends amen that's why you don't have to wait for a song leader you don't have to wait for an altar call no friends you don't have to wait amen while Peter yet spake the Holy Ghost fell on them you don't have to wait for somebody to lay hands on you Hallelujah you can say Lord you came that I might be free Hallelujah that's the truth brother I worship you under an open book CU I've been predestinated I've been chosen yes by Grace yes not by hand raising but because of how good my mother is how good my father is what good of a church I come out of but it's because he wrote my name in the blood section of the book what am I saying here tonight before there was a problem there was a solution to the problem like I said the last time the problem is not the problem it's how you handle the problem that becomes the problem but I'm so glad tonight that he took [Music] [Applause] this Justified as though you've never done it in the first place hallelujah oh thank you Jesus people can have their opinions people can have their own thinking about you but I'm looking at how he looks at me virtuous sunless spotless bride of Jesus Christ I didn't deserve it but he put my name down oh friend just feel that anointing coming in right now Hallelujah brother manam came and he told us the sealed evidence says true justification is though you've never done it in the first place God be praised tonight I trust that his little words has been a blessing to you I pray that God would bless you and give you that Grace to look at the Lamb's Book of Life and not look at your book because he broke the seals from offer your life now we can sing I have been redeemed I'm no longer a slave to fear that's right I know who I am amen I'm more than a conqueror what makes you more than a conqueror because of the seven seal message I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh may God bless you tonight may the Lord bless you richly let's bow our hearts father I thank you Father tonight I want to thank you for your presence I'm so glad father Lord Jesus that we could see the mystery Plan of Redemption and we could see father Lord God that whatever happens to us doesn't happen by chance you allowed that open evidence to be left like that so that I could be tempering so it can prove who's the original owner Lord I see so many things in the Bible how many times oh God Satan was out and tempered with Prophets yeah tempered with the children tempered oh God kingdoms but oh God you kept that promise for your children he said inheritance cannot leave this tribe it will stay in the tribe I pray tonight may you grant this virtuous bride tonight Grant her inheritance like we heard last night Lord May Lord God she look and say the days of men is over Moses is off the scene Joshua the Holy Ghost has come I want my portion tonight Grant it Lord tonight and Lord Jesus may we say oh God truly The Headstone has come down and we know what he wants done with the word bless each and every one father bless this assembly bless the church at last bless the bride of Christ and I ask oh God that you would give Grace for the many crosses that we will endure for we know Lord God that it's not going to get easier on this life but we do know that we are going in the Rapture amen that's our consolation tonight we ask this blessings in Jesus name and the church will agree with me by saying amen amen God bless [Music] you [Music] I've been blessed by what I've heard tonight it's reality the open the sealed how many of you said that's me man he was speaking to me that's me [Music] Mama as a minister of Christ and we have meetings and we can talk and we can show these things but I know this presence of God is moving among this building right now and I ask I don't need you to close your eyes and bow your head but maybe there's a Jacob here maybe there's a [Music] Rahab and you you been running and you see that I'm done God was speaking to me tonight and you'd like to raise your hand right now and say that's me Mama father right because Redemption comes from the father I mean really what it's all about cuz we ain't getting out of here until the last one maybe you're the last one maybe there's somebody here that you know I've been raised around this and I I've heard stories and I've heard all of these things and I've seen people get excited and I've wept and I've cried and I've laughed and but is it really [Music] mine is it really mine if you'd ask him if you'd ask your father to give you bread will he give you a [Music] stone is there someone here that would like to just you've never given your life to Jesus Christ you'd like to come down here right now to make a open public confession I'm going to ask you right now come maybe this this is this is it maybe this is the last meeting we're ever going to have now if everybody is saved in here and everybody's doing well you just stay right [Music] there a Jacob you know if your name's being called right [Music] now you don't have to beg [Music] just take another moment maybe there's someone else he said if you'll be ashamed of me before men I'll be ashamed of you yeah come on up here that's it it's what it's all about your father's calling you yeah come right on up front here yeah we're going to wait [Music] right what good are meetings without change relationship the evidence of Jacob [Music] wrestling he became a limping Prince his walk was forever changed all it takes is a moment all it takes but you know what you have to want it and see he says Jacob says what he asked the angel what is your name he said you don't need to know my name what is yours he said my name is Jacob he said Noah that's your Earthly name that's the reason you've been a Shyer you've been a deceiver your whole life but I tell you your name is Israel because you're a prince with God is there anyone else right [Music] now God is calling Hearts right now ah you don't have to beg and bleed no because he said when that last one begins to recognize their name in the book you know what these young ones are doing here and the different ones are saying hey you know what that's me [Music] brother Robert I want you to sing that he comes running after me running after me we're going to take a little bit and while we're singing this if we do this if you feel he's been running after you and you're tired of running why don't you just come on up here amen your goodness is running after it's running after me

and I'm going to say to those of you that are sitting there there's some of you that are a little bit convicted in your heart you haven't been living the way that you should be and you you said I want to do [Music] better I think everybody's hand on the GL he told Brother brandham yes the angel said in this third pole you got to be more [Music] sincere you why that little room why there he said cuz you is it not always according to scripture that if you'll seek God secretly in that little room I'll reward you openly amen God is faithful is he not hallelujah amen now I want us to speak to these that have come forward this is your day you're going to drive down a Stak and you're going to say from this day for yes Jacob are you listening because he said hey no no no no no you're not Jacob no more I'm going to take the I'm going to take that which is sealed and I'm going to say it's Israel you'll be a prince with God you know how God is so proud of you on what this decision that you have made you realize all of Heaven is is looking down you realize that Prophet messenger is probably looking down yeah look at them look at them they're they're still coming they we at this little interview right here before the closing of time Hallelujah before L is done there's going to be every little seed is going to come take their place it's still happening and don't you turn back and

indvidually but I want all of you I want all of you to pray with me let's bow our heads right now because sovereignly God has done a great work here Heavenly Father Lord God as your servant I I felt that there just something moving and Lord we we look about the book and the Seven sealed book of redemption we see all that we can get excited but father what about some of these that have never come
