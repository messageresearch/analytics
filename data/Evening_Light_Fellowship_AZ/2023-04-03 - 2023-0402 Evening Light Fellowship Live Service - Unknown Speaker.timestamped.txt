[24:03] with the seating if you can come as
[24:05] early as you can and and everything and
[24:08] if you're coming in late they're saying
[24:10] they want to try to help and have
[24:12] everybody set about 10 up to 10 15 after
[24:17] 10 15 if it's a large group they'll uh
[24:21] might have to split you up put you a
[24:23] couple seats here a couple seats there
[24:24] or whatever because moving people and
[24:27] everything it's a little bit of a
[24:28] disturbance we don't want to do that and
[24:30] people that have come early and they've
[24:32] got their spot you don't want to have to
[24:34] shift them over and to accommodate that

[24:47] a tremendous job for all these years but

[24:58] and we're getting bigger and there's so
[25:00] many more people and everything and God
[25:03] bless brother Arnold our deacons they do
[25:05] such a good job but if you could help us

[25:12] you know close in the Gap and we have
[25:15] seats up front and this is just my
[25:18] request
[25:19] it's always nice to have the younger
[25:22] ones come forward and sit a little bit
[25:25] closer and everything I love this

[25:38] have it every Sunday they you know we
[25:39] appreciate it and but God bless you all

[55:45] uh
[55:46] very very humbling
[55:48] to stand before you this morning I count
[55:52] myself the least of all the brethren

[56:03] still changing lives

[56:17] you know I I'm content to come and see
[56:19] it with you and enjoy and worship with
[56:22] you and that's that's no problem for me
[56:25] I like it I know you know brother Ron
[56:27] can identify some of you Minister
[56:28] Brothers it's nice sometimes you just go
[56:30] on a vacation you know if if you have
[56:33] something like this before you you know
[56:35] it kind of keeps you a little bit under
[56:36] the pressure
[56:37] so you maybe not enjoy things as much as
[56:40] you would but I I tell you what there's
[56:43] nothing that I enjoy More Than This
[56:45] presence amen that is that is just
[56:48] wonderful praise the Lord and just a
[56:51] gift that you have let's just start here
[56:53] Nehemiah the fourth chapter I want to
[56:54] read the first eight verses and then
[56:58] we'll go to the Lord in prayer
[57:00] it says if it came to pass when sambalot
[57:02] heard that we build the wall he was
[57:04] Wrath and took great indignation and
[57:06] mocked the Jews and he spanked before
[57:08] his brethren in the army of Samaria and
[57:11] said what do these feeble Jews will they
[57:14] fortify themselves with a sacrifice will
[57:17] they make an end in a day will they
[57:18] revive the stones out of the heaps of
[57:22] the rubbish which are burned now to buy
[57:24] his ammonite was by him and he said even
[57:27] that which they built if a fox go up he
[57:30] shall even break down their Stonewall
[57:33] hear o Our God for we are despised and
[57:37] turn the reproach upon their own head
[57:39] and give them for a prey in the land of
[57:42] captivity and cover not their iniquity
[57:45] and let not their sin be blotted out
[57:46] from before thee for they have provoked
[57:49] thee to anger before the builders
[57:51] so we built the wall
[57:54] and all the wall was joined together
[57:55] into the half thereof for the people had
[57:58] a mind to work
[58:00] but it came to pass when similar and
[58:02] tobiah and the Arabians and the
[58:04] ammonites and the ashtonites heard that
[58:07] the walls of Jerusalem were made up and
[58:09] that the breaches began to be stopped as
[58:11] they were very rough and they conspired
[58:14] all of them together to come and to
[58:16] fight against Jerusalem
[58:18] and to hinder it let's just buy our
[58:20] hearts Heavenly Father we just humble
[58:22] ourselves before you Lord is that
[58:24] wonderful song that we sung that chorus
[58:26] Lord without you
[58:27] we're nothing and you told us plainly in
[58:30] your word in John the 15th chapter of
[58:32] the doubt you we can do nothing but Lord
[58:34] we're all so so glad that through the
[58:37] scripture you've also revealed that we
[58:38] can do all things through you dear Lord
[58:40] for we know that it's you that does the
[58:42] work and it's not us it's not our
[58:43] ability it's not our strength dear Lord
[58:45] our gift as the prophet said was giving
[58:47] ourselves out of the way so that you may
[58:50] come and we could just be a channel that
[58:52] you could move through that you could
[58:54] speak through the Lord and we asked him
[58:55] this morning you would be so wonderfully
[58:57] gracious unto us and Lord you would come
[59:00] and you would bring forth your word and
[59:02] you would speak to our hearts Lord and
[59:04] that your word would be nourishment to
[59:06] our souls Lord we thank you for that
[59:08] your lord just uh we just surrender
[59:11] ourselves to you and we ask you to bless
[59:13] your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[59:16] amen amen God bless you may be seated
[59:18] this morning I just want to say before
[59:21] we get into the word of the Lord this
[59:23] morning that what a what a that was one
[59:26] of the greatest privileges
[59:28] one of the greatest honors for our
[59:30] sister Flo to come up and and wait to
[59:32] sing that song when we hear that I mean
[59:35] that was to me that was an honor and I
[59:37] appreciate that and those words are so
[59:39] perfect and and uh you know I was
[59:41] thinking when she was singing I said oh
[59:42] there's that that thought's buried here
[59:44] in the word this morning and uh that was
[59:47] certainly a privilege for me and now if
[59:50] you come this morning looking for
[59:52] brother Andrew Glover he's not here
[59:55] as he said Wednesday night I've known
[59:58] brother Andrew for a long time I
[1:00:00] remember him preaching and he was still
[1:00:02] younger than his shoe size
[1:00:06] which is like a 19. so you know I
[1:00:09] thought well one of these days when he's
[1:00:10] older than his shoe size he's really
[1:00:12] going to preach and and uh so that
[1:00:16] that's not me but hey when I grow up
[1:00:17] that's how I want to preach but I still
[1:00:20] got about four inches to go I'm getting
[1:00:23] there
[1:00:24] I'm getting there but so it was uh it
[1:00:27] was wonderful I'm not that I'm kind of
[1:00:29] like brother Ron said Wednesday night I
[1:00:31] don't listen fast enough he reads quotes
[1:00:34] faster than I can preach so uh but it
[1:00:37] was it was a tremendous blessing and so
[1:00:39] but you know what God has caught us each
[1:00:41] one different we're not all the same and
[1:00:43] he's got a purpose and and I believe God
[1:00:45] is just as much God this morning his
[1:00:47] word is just as real this morning as it
[1:00:50] was Wednesday night he's just as capable
[1:00:52] of coming and meeting you blessing you
[1:00:55] touching you as he was Wednesday night
[1:00:58] or any other time amen we're not looking
[1:01:00] at the man you don't look at the man if
[1:01:02] you look at me you'll be very very
[1:01:03] disappointed but if you look to Jesus
[1:01:05] Christ will never let you down he'll
[1:01:07] never disappoint you praise God and he's
[1:01:10] the one I am depending on now this
[1:01:12] morning as we look at the word of the
[1:01:13] Lord I'll tell you I I thought I think
[1:01:15] hey this is Palm Sunday Lord let me
[1:01:18] preach behold the king cometh or let me
[1:01:21] preach an Easter message or whatever but
[1:01:23] the Lord just kept bringing me back to
[1:01:26] this thought and I couldn't get away
[1:01:27] from this and I think it is something
[1:01:29] that is so applicable to every single
[1:01:32] one of us it doesn't matter how much
[1:01:34] Revelation that you have it doesn't
[1:01:36] matter how many quotes that you know
[1:01:38] that's all good right we all want those
[1:01:41] things but yet you're still fighting a
[1:01:43] battle and we find here where we took
[1:01:46] the story from Nehemiah let me just let
[1:01:48] me just give a little
[1:01:49] backdrop if I could to bring us up to
[1:01:52] this fourth chapter of Nehemiah we find
[1:01:54] it we remember this is when the Jews
[1:01:56] have been taken captive by King
[1:01:57] Nebuchadnezzar they've been taken to
[1:01:59] Babylon and that Jerusalem had been
[1:02:02] destroyed the Palaces the temple and the
[1:02:05] walls have been broken down and burned
[1:02:07] and Jerusalem was left in disaster and
[1:02:10] we know brother Andrew bought it out
[1:02:12] Wednesday night but the books amen that
[1:02:14] Daniel had Revelation it was going to be
[1:02:16] 70 years of the Captivity and we find
[1:02:18] here they're coming down to the end of
[1:02:20] that captivity and there's a map of the
[1:02:22] name of Nehemiah that is a cut buyer to
[1:02:25] the King of Persia Arthur Xerxes and
[1:02:29] that as he's in the palace and shushan
[1:02:31] then all of a sudden there comes some of
[1:02:33] the Jews from Judah unto the palace and
[1:02:37] Nehemiah sees as these Jews that he
[1:02:39] begins to inquire them he says what
[1:02:41] about the RAM and what about those that
[1:02:43] are into captivity what about the the
[1:02:45] condition of Jerusalem tell me about it
[1:02:48] you know there was something in Hebrew
[1:02:49] wanted to know what was going on and so
[1:02:52] Hannah and I and them they began to tell
[1:02:54] him hey here's what's going on it's the
[1:02:56] city is in rubbish the walls are broken
[1:02:58] down the uh the people are in a horrible
[1:03:01] desolate condition and so on and
[1:03:04] immediately the Bible tells us that that
[1:03:06] Nehemiah began to seek the Lord he began
[1:03:08] to mourn he began to fast he began to
[1:03:11] pray because of the condition that
[1:03:13] Jerusalem was in his heart was broken he
[1:03:16] was burdened about this and it says the
[1:03:18] next time that you go to the second
[1:03:20] chapter you find out did he goes in
[1:03:21] before the king amen but yet he's
[1:03:24] stealing mourning and the King notices
[1:03:26] the sadness that Nehemiah was displaying
[1:03:29] and he recognized hey this isn't the way
[1:03:31] that this man usually is and he began to
[1:03:33] ask hey Nehemiah what's going on what's
[1:03:35] wrong you you've never been like this
[1:03:37] before what's happening so Nehemiah
[1:03:39] began to unburden himself before the
[1:03:41] king uh you know here's the condition
[1:03:43] some of my brethren come and here's the
[1:03:45] condition of the sepulchers of my
[1:03:47] fathers and and it's in Rome and and so
[1:03:50] forth and and so the king says hey what
[1:03:53] what can we do about this and so
[1:03:54] Nehemiah had a bird not just I'm
[1:03:57] concerned about something but I want to
[1:03:59] do something also and so the king said
[1:04:02] hey you know what I'll send you to
[1:04:03] Jerusalem and and I'll send you with
[1:04:06] letters that you can get the materials
[1:04:07] that you can do a work of rebuilding the
[1:04:10] walls around Jerusalem and so we find
[1:04:14] out that that's where we kind of come to
[1:04:16] amen that here's Nehemiah he's come and
[1:04:20] he's rebuilding these walls and uh he's
[1:04:23] come uh he's come to to do this work and
[1:04:27] it tells us that third chapter that is
[1:04:28] he met with the uh the elders and the
[1:04:31] priests and so forth of Jerusalem in
[1:04:33] that desolate condition that they begin
[1:04:35] to to get divvy out who's going to do
[1:04:38] what part part who's going to do you
[1:04:40] know everybody everybody's got a part to
[1:04:42] play and who's going to do this work
[1:04:45] who's going to do this portion it's
[1:04:46] going to begin to divide it out and it
[1:04:48] began the construction rebuilding the
[1:04:50] walls and so we come down to this fourth
[1:04:52] chapter and we find out here as they
[1:04:55] began the work that there was a man by
[1:04:57] the name assemble all amen which was a
[1:04:59] honorite of of Moab he wasn't a Jew and
[1:05:03] he begins to mock them the Bible tells
[1:05:06] us here we'll begin to to read amen that
[1:05:08] they were under great indignation and
[1:05:11] they mocked the Jews and they began to
[1:05:14] say things and say what do these feeble
[1:05:18] Jews what do they do what do they think
[1:05:19] that they're doing and they will they
[1:05:22] fortify themselves with a sacrifice will
[1:05:24] they revive the stones out of the
[1:05:26] rubbish is this what they think they're
[1:05:28] going to rebuild this city that's been
[1:05:30] destroyed is that what they're
[1:05:32] intentious now listen here's Nehemiah he
[1:05:36] and the Jews that are working they're
[1:05:37] hearing what is being said
[1:05:40] they're hearing this this is you know
[1:05:42] because he begins to repeat to God you
[1:05:45] know what they're doing they're mocking
[1:05:46] us they're making fun of us they're
[1:05:48] making fun of the word so it wasn't that
[1:05:50] sambalod and tobiah and these uh these
[1:05:54] individuals are out whispering and
[1:05:56] saying these things you know somewhere
[1:05:58] where they can't be heard no they're
[1:05:59] saying them out intentionally so that
[1:06:02] the Jews those doing the work would hear
[1:06:05] what was being said
[1:06:07] and I want to take a thought this
[1:06:09] morning if I could I don't know if he
[1:06:11] put it on the screen but psychological
[1:06:13] warfare
[1:06:14] psychological warfare
[1:06:17] at the end time
[1:06:19] oh man that's where we're living that's
[1:06:21] why I say I believe this thought this
[1:06:22] morning is applicable to every one of us
[1:06:24] regardless of how much you know how much
[1:06:26] Revelation you have how many quotes how
[1:06:28] long you've been serving the lord I
[1:06:30] believe that we're all involved in a
[1:06:32] psychological warfare that is going on
[1:06:34] and that's where Nehemiah was at he was
[1:06:37] in a psychological warfare the enemy's
[1:06:39] saying things he's talking and and and
[1:06:42] telling things now this word is
[1:06:44] psychological warfare it's actually a
[1:06:47] it's a defined term and it is the plan
[1:06:50] tactical use of non-combat techniques to
[1:06:53] otherwise uh influence the thinking
[1:06:58] or behavior of an enemy now that's the
[1:07:02] definition that you love for
[1:07:04] psychological warfare it says to affect
[1:07:06] to otherwise influence the thinking or
[1:07:08] behavior of an enemy now that is again
[1:07:11] that's if you go look up that definition
[1:07:13] that's going to give you but my thought
[1:07:15] is just a little bit different it says
[1:07:16] it's not or otherwise influence of
[1:07:18] thinking our Behavior that's not what
[1:07:21] Satan's doing Satan is wanting a man to
[1:07:24] influence the thinking so he can affect
[1:07:26] the behavior
[1:07:27] you know that's what he's doing that's
[1:07:28] what the psychological warfare and
[1:07:30] that's why Sam Malone and these guys who
[1:07:32] wanted these feeble Jews think they're
[1:07:33] going to do they're going to revive out
[1:07:34] of this rubbish and suddenly we're
[1:07:36] saying these things to try to discourage
[1:07:39] them to try to make them think hey the
[1:07:41] effort is too big the the battle is too
[1:07:43] hard the the hill is too high to climb
[1:07:46] don't try don't bother that was that was
[1:07:48] a psychological warfare but I want you
[1:07:50] to know something here whenever uh
[1:07:53] Nehemiah and these Jews they heard these
[1:07:54] things you know what Nehemiah didn't go
[1:07:56] face to face with symbol out he didn't
[1:07:58] go over and say Hey I want to argue with
[1:07:59] you I want to debate with you amen I
[1:08:01] want to you know I'm gonna argue this
[1:08:03] point with you that was not his tactic
[1:08:05] his tactic was he went to the Lord he
[1:08:07] began to pray he began to seek the Lord
[1:08:10] in behalf hey we're under attack amen
[1:08:13] they're coming against us so it wasn't
[1:08:14] that he was going to argue you're not
[1:08:17] ever going to I'll argue the devil
[1:08:21] you don't do it you know hey you can't
[1:08:23] argue somebody and with them to the Lord
[1:08:26] I guess when I was young Chris I thought
[1:08:28] you know hey I've got some Revelation
[1:08:29] here let me let me start proving to uh
[1:08:32] this good Baptist friend or whatever it
[1:08:34] might have been let me let me begin to
[1:08:36] show them and you begin to argue you
[1:08:38] know what you don't win anybody by
[1:08:39] arguing
[1:08:41] that just you know this drives them
[1:08:42] further back and you can't beat the
[1:08:44] devil with arguing with him and so
[1:08:46] Nehemiah he he didn't take that tactic
[1:08:49] I'm going to argue that with him I'm
[1:08:50] going to debate with him
[1:08:52] he's he went he began to pray
[1:08:54] and it says that after they prayed Amen
[1:08:58] in the sixth verse so so built with the
[1:09:01] wall
[1:09:02] and all the walls joined together into
[1:09:04] the hath there also half done
[1:09:06] except for the people that are mine to
[1:09:07] work
[1:09:09] every pastor wants people with mind to
[1:09:12] work everybody wants a a congregation
[1:09:15] that has a desire
[1:09:18] to do something to accomplish something
[1:09:20] to be about amen or establishing the
[1:09:24] kingdom of God Amen that's what we
[1:09:26] desire and so here it is the people had
[1:09:27] that mind to work and because they were
[1:09:30] doing the work the Bible says that when
[1:09:32] Sam alone Tobias the Arabians and then
[1:09:35] those that with them when they saw what
[1:09:36] was going on that you know they're
[1:09:38] they're playing tactic of uh the
[1:09:40] psychological warfare began to happen
[1:09:43] amen that they uh they were very rough
[1:09:47] and it conspired all of them together to
[1:09:50] come and to fight against Jerusalem and
[1:09:52] he entered see that's what Satan's
[1:09:53] tactic is whenever he begins to try to
[1:09:56] come against you with putting thoughts
[1:09:58] in your mind amen is to hinder the work
[1:10:01] hinder what you're doing for almighty
[1:10:03] God now listen if you want to be a part
[1:10:05] of a softball league or whatever Satan
[1:10:07] he'll Pat you on the back and he'll buy
[1:10:09] you a new glove
[1:10:11] but if you want to do the work of the
[1:10:12] Lord I'm going to tell you something
[1:10:13] he's going to do all that he can to try
[1:10:15] to hinder you he's going to put every
[1:10:17] thought in your mind and some of you can
[1:10:19] identify with this you had a desire to
[1:10:21] do something for almighty God and the
[1:10:23] devil starts dealing with you telling
[1:10:25] you you can't do it you're not good
[1:10:26] enough whatever right
[1:10:28] have you ever felt maybe just in
[1:10:29] inspired of the Lord amen just to go
[1:10:32] pray for somebody you just thought hey
[1:10:35] that person's down discouraged you know
[1:10:37] I just want to go pray for him and
[1:10:39] immediately that devil starts to oh who
[1:10:42] Do You Think You Are you're not good
[1:10:44] enough what are they going to say you
[1:10:45] lay your hands on on them or you call uh
[1:10:48] uh pray for them or whatever see that
[1:10:50] psychological warfare he's trying to
[1:10:52] affect your behavior he's trying to get
[1:10:54] into your mind Amen to keep you the hint
[1:10:57] of the word to keep you from doing what
[1:10:59] God has ordained you to do what God has
[1:11:01] asked you to do amen and so if he can
[1:11:03] get a foothold into your mind amen he
[1:11:06] begins to control things
[1:11:08] yeah
[1:11:10] Paul kind of dealt just a little bit
[1:11:12] with this in Romans the seventh chapter
[1:11:15] and he he says in the 23rd verse this is
[1:11:18] such an interesting chapter but he says
[1:11:20] in the 23rd verse he says but I see
[1:11:22] another law in my members warring
[1:11:25] against the law of my mind
[1:11:29] and bringing me to Camp give you the law
[1:11:31] of sin which is in my members and so
[1:11:32] there's another war going on here in the
[1:11:36] mind and one of the translations says
[1:11:37] but there's another power within me that
[1:11:40] is at war with my mind another
[1:11:42] translation says Waging War against the
[1:11:45] law of my mind and so there's a Warn and
[1:11:47] we all know that right we're all we've
[1:11:49] all seen that we've all been involved in
[1:11:51] that in fact brother Ram talked about in
[1:11:53] the the greatest battle ever fought I
[1:11:55] got some uh uh quotes uh pulled out of
[1:11:58] that message in 161st uh paragraph he
[1:12:02] says open up that mind that's the
[1:12:05] battlefield there is where the battle
[1:12:07] sets an array right there in the front
[1:12:10] line
[1:12:11] your mind I mean it's psychological
[1:12:13] warfare that's where it's taking place
[1:12:15] and you open up the Mind amen it depends
[1:12:17] on what you open it up to amen and so
[1:12:19] the enemy wants you to give him ear to
[1:12:22] the that he can get into this
[1:12:24] battlefield in the 111th verse brother
[1:12:26] Graham says see it's your mind that
[1:12:28] opens up the door or closes the door and
[1:12:30] listens to your conscience listens to
[1:12:32] your memory listens to your affections
[1:12:34] but when your mind closes itself to
[1:12:36] these things and let God the spirit of
[1:12:38] his word come in it blows the rest of
[1:12:40] the stuff out every doubt is gone every
[1:12:42] fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is
[1:12:45] gone every feeling is gone there's
[1:12:47] nothing standing there but the word of
[1:12:48] God and Satan cannot battle against that
[1:12:51] no sir he cannot battle against it now
[1:12:54] we know that's true these battles has
[1:12:57] raged since the days of the Garden of
[1:12:59] Eden the battle in the human mind Satan
[1:13:01] started it what did he do when he met
[1:13:04] Eve he didn't deny God's word but he
[1:13:06] white washed it
[1:13:07] that's what he's still doing right he
[1:13:10] started this at the beginning he's had
[1:13:12] thousands of years of practice and you
[1:13:15] are now in the middle of this battle
[1:13:17] he goes on to stay down in 115th bear
[1:13:20] gray says the battle Rags when Eve
[1:13:22] opened up her mind to listen to her
[1:13:24] reasoning
[1:13:26] so that's where Satan wants you to go I
[1:13:27] want you to start reasoning things
[1:13:29] instead of taking God at his word
[1:13:34] brother Robert gave a little testimony
[1:13:36] there of uh of what Josiah is going
[1:13:39] through and and put him took him to the
[1:13:42] hospital because the new artists wanted
[1:13:43] to scan the brain to see if there's
[1:13:45] there's things going on in the first
[1:13:47] scan there was nothing the second scared
[1:13:49] I think the 24-hour period was over and
[1:13:51] then as Josiah was waking up out of
[1:13:53] sleepy he he had this event or what
[1:13:55] incident whatever it was and they said
[1:13:57] we couldn't find it on EEG that there
[1:13:59] was anything there and when Sharon was
[1:14:02] telling me that I guess she'd got it
[1:14:03] from being this one that says hey you
[1:14:05] know what it's nothing but the devil
[1:14:09] but our problems a lot of times I mean
[1:14:10] we want to look at it from a purely
[1:14:12] human standpoint of what is this what is
[1:14:16] causing this amen that's what's Satan
[1:14:19] that's the game that Satan wants you to
[1:14:20] play he wants you to begin a reason in
[1:14:22] your mind what is this statement when
[1:14:24] sometimes we just got to say it's
[1:14:26] nothing but the devil this is Satan
[1:14:28] Satan trying to attack Satan trying to
[1:14:30] destroy amen but we know that Satan is a
[1:14:33] liar right amen Brethren goes on to say
[1:14:36] in the the 214th verse of the greatest
[1:14:38] battle ever fall he said listen at him
[1:14:40] now just how nasty he gets and how he
[1:14:43] whitewashes that word what's he trying
[1:14:46] to do get into her mind see he's talking
[1:14:49] to her after the word was already
[1:14:51] fortified there
[1:14:53] so Satan recognizes amen that is you as
[1:14:55] a believer that you've got the word you
[1:14:56] have revealed word you had true amen but
[1:14:58] he still begins to play in the mind
[1:15:00] right he still wants to put these
[1:15:02] thoughts in your mind and if Satan can
[1:15:04] capture your mind if he can capture your
[1:15:05] thoughts if you if he can just get that
[1:15:07] for just a few minutes amen then he will
[1:15:10] begin to mentally torture you
[1:15:12] he'll put everything now if you can
[1:15:13] control your thoughts he can control
[1:15:15] your emotions
[1:15:17] and ultimately your actions
[1:15:20] if he can if he can Captivate the
[1:15:22] thoughts amen if he can get into
[1:15:23] thoughts amen he begins to control that
[1:15:25] amen he can get you to accept a sickness
[1:15:28] or affliction
[1:15:29] you know we began to reason began to
[1:15:31] think that it's you know well Grandma
[1:15:33] amen she had cancer
[1:15:36] Uncle blue he he had diabetes
[1:15:40] and so you know it's in the family
[1:15:42] there's a family history and I said
[1:15:43] what's Satan doing he's playing
[1:15:45] psychological warfare with you amen all
[1:15:47] of a sudden you get a little rash on her
[1:15:48] skin oh that's melanoma
[1:15:50] hey man you know you you all these
[1:15:52] things he began to do they begin to
[1:15:54] control the thoughts and he'll convince
[1:15:56] you that you're sick he'll convince you
[1:15:58] that you're defeated he'll convince you
[1:16:00] that you're not loved that nobody cares
[1:16:02] about you that you're not worthy that
[1:16:03] you're not good enough That's what Satan
[1:16:06] wants to do he wants to get into mind so
[1:16:08] that you have that defeated mentality
[1:16:10] that you don't look at yourself as a
[1:16:12] writer Jesus Christ you know look at
[1:16:14] yourself amen as word amen you look at
[1:16:17] yourself as a defeated person if you
[1:16:20] were he gets into Divine amen if you
[1:16:22] were really a Son of God if you were
[1:16:24] really a part of the mind of Jesus
[1:16:26] Christ amen you wouldn't have this you
[1:16:28] wouldn't do this amen that psychological
[1:16:30] warfare he's trying to control he's
[1:16:32] trying to control your thoughts amen
[1:16:34] because what he does he controls your
[1:16:36] emotions and he'll overwhelm you and
[1:16:38] despair and discouragement
[1:16:40] and that's the battle that we Face
[1:16:42] saving that's what we have to go through
[1:16:43] amen when the enemy keeps bringing
[1:16:45] things before us
[1:16:47] hey man we've got a we gotta right now
[1:16:49] say I'm not looking to that
[1:16:51] I'm not looking I'm looking to the word
[1:16:53] of God I'm looking to the the truth
[1:16:55] praise God Amen so you know you'll
[1:16:58] overwhelm he'll break your spirit
[1:17:01] you know if you can if you just get if
[1:17:02] you can just get an audience who's in
[1:17:04] your thought process in that Battlefield
[1:17:06] if he could just get onto that
[1:17:08] Battlefield and get you to step on that
[1:17:09] Battlefield with him but then he begins
[1:17:12] to do these things Paul wrote to the
[1:17:15] church at thessalonica second
[1:17:16] Thessalonians the second chapter the
[1:17:18] second verse he says that ye be not soon
[1:17:21] shaken in mind
[1:17:24] or be troubled neither my spirit nor by
[1:17:26] word nor by a letter from us as that day
[1:17:29] of Christ's hand now for the first six
[1:17:31] thousand years basically of History
[1:17:34] psychological warfare was swayed by
[1:17:37] a spirit
[1:17:39] which still is today
[1:17:41] you know that Spirit coming and
[1:17:43] Whispering something in your mind trying
[1:17:46] to convince you deceive you whatever it
[1:17:48] is but Paul said he said by Spirit nor
[1:17:51] by word and we know that's not referring
[1:17:53] to as the word of God that this word the
[1:17:55] written word or a form of word amen
[1:17:58] communication gossip people talking amen
[1:18:01] or by letters so for the first six
[1:18:03] thousand years are there about amen it
[1:18:06] was the psychological warfare was you
[1:18:08] know a spirit coming uh or you maybe
[1:18:11] reading a letter or somebody talking
[1:18:13] that was that was their that was his
[1:18:16] tactics that was his Weaponry but we
[1:18:18] come around to the 20th century and the
[1:18:21] next thing you know you got a a
[1:18:23] telephone
[1:18:26] and then you know it evolves into radio
[1:18:29] broadcast and radio
[1:18:31] and and then from there into television
[1:18:35] and from there into computers
[1:18:38] and you know when I was young I when I
[1:18:41] was young that was a long time ago
[1:18:43] growing up in a good Methodist home uh
[1:18:47] not message Methodist home we had a TV
[1:18:52] and we we it's a black and white
[1:18:54] television and we got one channel
[1:18:57] and if you wanted to watch TV on
[1:18:59] Saturday night you watched Lawrence Welk
[1:19:00] and black and white
[1:19:02] some of you were laughing because you're
[1:19:03] old enough to know who Lawrence Welk is
[1:19:04] some of you young people's like I have
[1:19:06] no clue what you're talking about hey
[1:19:08] man so but it's come a long way right so
[1:19:10] here's television we know how the
[1:19:12] prophet of God preached against
[1:19:13] television
[1:19:14] but you know it didn't stop there amen
[1:19:17] it evolved into computers and from a
[1:19:20] computer into the internet
[1:19:22] and from an internet into social media
[1:19:25] amen so that everybody's carrying around
[1:19:27] in their pocket at any point in time of
[1:19:30] the day amen you can be out hiking in a
[1:19:32] desert and and you've got access to
[1:19:34] what's going on around the world so this
[1:19:36] becomes Satan's super weapons
[1:19:39] I'm not just that reading a letter well
[1:19:41] I got a letter from from Gertrude and
[1:19:44] she's telling me here all the things
[1:19:45] that's going on no no no no I mean when
[1:19:47] it's happening around the world Amen
[1:19:49] you're knowing about it immediately and
[1:19:51] you know I believe that some people are
[1:19:53] a little bit too engaged in CNN
[1:19:57] are fox or whoever else you want to call
[1:19:59] it amen they want to know and and you
[1:20:01] know what that is a lot of times that's
[1:20:02] just feeding that's just feeding the
[1:20:04] doubts it's feeding the fears it's
[1:20:06] feeding listen if if I believe that
[1:20:08] everything that I'm listening to and
[1:20:10] watching hey I'd be building a a nuclear
[1:20:13] bomb shelter in my backyard
[1:20:15] but thank God I have Revelation that
[1:20:17] before that first Bob ever Falls

[1:20:22] amen so I'm not looking to that you've
[1:20:25] got to be careful of what you're looking
[1:20:27] at what you're listening to but Satan
[1:20:29] has all this amen for people to focus on
[1:20:32] all these things that he's now battling
[1:20:35] your mind with feeling your mind full so
[1:20:38] hey we go Lord bring me back to the word
[1:20:40] of God bring me back to the truth bring
[1:20:41] me back to the message amen bring me
[1:20:44] back to Revelation and not what the
[1:20:47] world is saying because if that gets in
[1:20:50] you know it begins to affect you they
[1:20:51] got little sister at church I mean
[1:20:53] she'll she'll get uh she'll get on her
[1:20:56] computer and she'll start looking at all
[1:20:59] the latest news
[1:21:01] and then she'll walk into church and her
[1:21:04] head is just like this and I kid you not
[1:21:06] she walks in a church like this
[1:21:09] I don't know how she don't bump into the
[1:21:11] wall
[1:21:13] and I I looked I said hey oh she's been
[1:21:16] on the internet again listening to all
[1:21:18] the you know it's having effect on her
[1:21:22] so you gotta watch us that's exactly
[1:21:23] what Satan wants say man you know hey
[1:21:26] the black dog or the white dog which one
[1:21:28] are you feeding right I mean which one
[1:21:29] is which one are you giving something to
[1:21:31] amen which one's going now we go back
[1:21:34] over here to Nehemiah and it says in the
[1:21:36] ninth verse we didn't read this at the
[1:21:37] beginning but he says in the next verse
[1:21:39] says nevertheless we made our prayers
[1:21:41] unto God and set watch against them day
[1:21:44] and night because of them now so here it
[1:21:47] is they threat we're going to hinder the
[1:21:48] work we're going to do what we can to
[1:21:49] hinder this work
[1:21:52] foreign they went to prayer
[1:21:55] let's consult the Lord let's talk to the
[1:21:57] Lord about it but it says in a 10th
[1:21:58] verse says and Judah said the strength
[1:22:01] of the Bears of burden is decayed and
[1:22:03] there is much rubbish so that we are not
[1:22:06] able to build the wall now this was a
[1:22:08] samelot this was some of the enemies
[1:22:11] this was Judah
[1:22:13] they had heard enough
[1:22:16] amid all of a sudden now they're saying
[1:22:19] hey we can't do this
[1:22:20] if Satan can feel your mind full of
[1:22:23] rubbish he will Decay your strength
[1:22:26] if he can get your mind full of so much
[1:22:29] things that's going on in the world Amen
[1:22:31] he will Decay your strength will be
[1:22:33] diminished amen so here it is they began
[1:22:35] look at that begin to hold my it's just
[1:22:37] too big the task is too much it's it's
[1:22:39] too hard you know how how many times
[1:22:42] have we looked at that and we believe
[1:22:43] that and maybe we even looked at someone
[1:22:46] and thought wow they've gone too far
[1:22:47] they've done too much you know I give up
[1:22:49] hope on that well you know I've seen
[1:22:51] people like that amen that I had given
[1:22:53] up hope on that it had been in years and
[1:22:56] drugs and years and and just the garbage
[1:23:00] of the world and all of a sudden when I
[1:23:02] thought there's no hope there was no way
[1:23:03] amen all of a sudden God reached down to
[1:23:05] that person and God said let me show you
[1:23:08] what I can do amen it's not too hard for
[1:23:11] me it's not too difficult for me amen so
[1:23:14] don't look at the circumstance look at
[1:23:16] your God Amen look at the one you're
[1:23:18] serving look at the words you call the
[1:23:20] king of glory because he can change
[1:23:22] things right no matter what the
[1:23:24] circumstance or situation is he's great
[1:23:26] later than that so don't let it decay
[1:23:29] your strength if you're looking at the
[1:23:32] rubbish it will do that
[1:23:34] listen one day uh
[1:23:37] there in a storm and a boat
[1:23:40] here's the disciples and they think
[1:23:42] they're going down and they look out and
[1:23:44] here comes Jesus walking on the water
[1:23:46] and Peter gets folded and said Lord if
[1:23:48] that's you let me come on the Water by
[1:23:50] faith Peter got out of that boat
[1:23:54] but whenever he began to look at the
[1:23:56] circumstance
[1:23:58] he didn't want he didn't stay afloat
[1:24:00] right he began to sink when he got his
[1:24:03] eyes off the word when he goes I've lost
[1:24:05] the Jesus Christ and he began to look
[1:24:07] how the wind was blowing in the waves
[1:24:09] and and all that when he began to look
[1:24:10] at the circumstances he said That's what
[1:24:12] Satan again that's what he wants to do
[1:24:13] he wants you to focus on the
[1:24:15] circumstance not on the word not on the
[1:24:18] answer amen but the circumstance are too
[1:24:20] great The problem is too big it is not
[1:24:23] too big for God nothing is impossible to
[1:24:27] them that believe Hallelujah we've got
[1:24:30] to be the ones that's believing we got
[1:24:31] to be standing on the unadulterated word
[1:24:33] of almighty God if there's anybody on
[1:24:36] Earth today that should be standing on
[1:24:38] the word it ought to be the Bride of
[1:24:39] Jesus Christ because we become the word
[1:24:42] right amen so how can we deny the word
[1:24:44] and when we're listening to what Satan
[1:24:46] is saying amen instead of the word
[1:24:50] hey man they were operating on his
[1:24:52] Battleground
[1:24:54] it goes on in this 11th verse
[1:25:01] excuse me
[1:25:02] he goes on in hell yeah that's better
[1:25:04] well it's dry out here y'all know it's
[1:25:06] dry out here
[1:25:08] you know I don't ever think about that
[1:25:11] get up here preaching I'm like man I
[1:25:14] I've got cotton balls coming out
[1:25:17] cotton balls do not come from Louisiana
[1:25:21] but in 11th verse it says and are at the
[1:25:25] series said
[1:25:27] they shall not know neither see till we
[1:25:31] come in the midst among them and slay
[1:25:33] them and cause the work to cease
[1:25:37] now I want you to know something
[1:25:39] terrorists didn't start on 9 11.
[1:25:42] because this verse right here tells us
[1:25:44] they had terrorism terrorists amen back
[1:25:48] here nehemiah's Damon they're not going
[1:25:50] to know the answer we're going to come
[1:25:51] in a Muslim or we'll sleep in there amen
[1:25:53] and they're not going to know what
[1:25:54] happened until he destroyed the work I
[1:25:55] mean so he caused the work deceased
[1:25:57] again that was the whole tactic of the
[1:25:59] enemy amen is to cause the work of God
[1:26:02] to cease amen so we see this I mean if
[1:26:05] you're listening to the enemy the Bible
[1:26:09] tells us first Timothy 4th chapter the
[1:26:11] first verse now the spirits speak
[1:26:13] expressly that in the latter times some
[1:26:15] shall depart from the faith giving heed
[1:26:19] to seducing spirits and doctrines of
[1:26:21] devils I mean so somebody's going to
[1:26:23] listen to that that gave heed to it and
[1:26:26] when it began to listen to it it began
[1:26:28] to have an effect upon them amen so that
[1:26:30] now they've and we've known right we've
[1:26:33] seen people that have fallen away people
[1:26:35] that used to work for worship amongst
[1:26:36] that you would have never imagined amen
[1:26:38] but yet they went out there to one of
[1:26:40] those super weapons of Satan of the
[1:26:42] psychological warfare to the internet
[1:26:44] and to begin to listen to things on the
[1:26:47] internet they begin to watch things on
[1:26:49] the internet and believe in a sign
[1:26:52] they don't believe a sign amen they move
[1:26:55] thought something false right and so
[1:26:57] giving heed to seducing spirits
[1:27:00] you know you hear a brother fall away
[1:27:02] you know he says well listen just he
[1:27:04] said just go out and listen I said no
[1:27:06] I'm not I'm not doing that I'm not going
[1:27:09] to give heed to seducing Spirits I'm not
[1:27:10] going to listen to doctrines of devils
[1:27:12] I'm not going to give ear to that amen
[1:27:14] there's enough psychological warfare why
[1:27:17] would I submit myself to those things
[1:27:20] I want to submit myself to the spirit of
[1:27:22] God to the word of almighty God let that
[1:27:24] be in me let that have control over me
[1:27:27] amen let that rule and write to me I
[1:27:29] don't need to feel my mind full of
[1:27:31] things amen that's gonna the devil's
[1:27:32] gonna feed our father or he's going to
[1:27:34] use against me
[1:27:36] okay remember they were listening they
[1:27:38] heard the adversaries they're giving
[1:27:40] heed into seducing spirits and doctrines
[1:27:42] of devils and they departed from the
[1:27:44] faith so it happens and we know that
[1:27:46] it's going to happen it has happened but
[1:27:49] God forbid that we should be a casualty
[1:27:51] we should be a victim
[1:27:53] I didn't come as far to be a victim
[1:27:55] I didn't come this car far to be a
[1:27:58] casualty in this psychological warfare
[1:28:01] amen amen I think we're almost out of
[1:28:03] here amen and I'm not giving up now amen
[1:28:07] I'm not turning in now amen I'm not
[1:28:09] laying down my armor now praise God but
[1:28:11] I'm Gonna Stand and I'm going to fight
[1:28:13] with the word of almighty God Amen
[1:28:14] because I know that it's going to be
[1:28:16] over one of these days
[1:28:20] I don't want to be a statistic oh that
[1:28:22] was the one who fell away
[1:28:24] but in the the 11th verse says their
[1:28:26] adversary said in a 12th verse it says
[1:28:29] and it came to pass that when the Jews
[1:28:33] which dwelt by them came
[1:28:36] they said unto us ten times not just
[1:28:38] once but ten times
[1:28:40] oh from all places when she shall return
[1:28:44] unto us they will be upon you
[1:28:47] so it was the Jews it was savings
[1:28:50] because they heard the adversaries
[1:28:52] saying it the Jews that dwelt by them
[1:28:55] so this is really important that if you
[1:28:58] have to be careful who you're hanging
[1:28:59] around with
[1:29:02] because there's going to be some people
[1:29:03] out there it's going to fill your mind
[1:29:05] all they call themselves Christians they
[1:29:08] maybe once they believed right
[1:29:10] oh they but the Jews which dwelt by them
[1:29:13] they dwelt by the adversaries they heard
[1:29:15] what the adversaries were saying and now
[1:29:17] they're repeating what the adversary
[1:29:19] said
[1:29:20] you know how Satan does it
[1:29:22] amen he wants to he wants you to repeat
[1:29:25] what the internet says
[1:29:28] you know an amazing today that you can
[1:29:30] take a picture or something with Google
[1:29:32] and he'll identify
[1:29:34] and so bye and it'll take you to some
[1:29:36] website that you can find out more
[1:29:38] information and and if oh this is
[1:29:40] terrible this is bad this is all this is
[1:29:42] oh hey I got a God that's bigger than
[1:29:45] that amen I've got a God that has dealt
[1:29:48] with harder than that amen right amen so
[1:29:51] here it is the Jews which dwelt by then
[1:29:54] be careful who your young people be
[1:29:56] careful who you hang around with
[1:29:59] because they'll start telling you things
[1:30:01] and they're saying you know you're
[1:30:02] repeating what they're saying instead of
[1:30:04] repeating what the word of God said
[1:30:05] instead of saying thus saith the Lord
[1:30:07] you're repeating what somebody else says
[1:30:09] about a situation I'm not interested
[1:30:11] what somebody else thinks about it I
[1:30:13] want to know what the Lord says about it
[1:30:15] you know I don't go out here looking for
[1:30:16] counterfeit money oh let me go out here
[1:30:18] brother let me go ahead and see if I can
[1:30:19] find some counterfeit twenty dollar
[1:30:21] bills I mean I'm not interested in
[1:30:22] counterfeit I want the real thing I want
[1:30:25] what's real amen and that's the way we
[1:30:27] should be we're interested in the truth
[1:30:28] amen not something that the enemy is
[1:30:30] trying to perpetrate not something lies
[1:30:32] that the enemy's trying to tell amen I
[1:30:35] don't have time for that
[1:30:37] amen so here they are they're repeating
[1:30:39] it oh they're going to be upon you
[1:30:42] you think you've got it all in control
[1:30:44] they're going to be upon you it says
[1:30:46] they're the 13th verse says therefore I
[1:30:48] said in the lower places behind the wall
[1:30:49] and on the higher place that I even set
[1:30:51] the people out to their families with
[1:30:53] their swords
[1:30:55] with their Spears with the rose and
[1:30:57] silver rings he said he said a watch
[1:30:59] let's watch him and let's watch to see
[1:31:01] him I'm not gonna let you to be just
[1:31:02] come in and take my children away come
[1:31:05] in and destroy our home and destroy our
[1:31:07] lives and come into the church and do
[1:31:08] these things every once while you know
[1:31:10] what the pastor has to do said this
[1:31:11] person's causing problems you know you
[1:31:13] probably better off down the road
[1:31:13] somewhere
[1:31:15] yeah I had a brother he asked me to come
[1:31:18] preach and brother Ron I I trust I'm not
[1:31:21] trying to do this wouldn't do this I
[1:31:22] shouldn't even tell this let me just
[1:31:23] forget that now you're curious aren't
[1:31:26] you now you're curious
[1:31:28] had a brother he he had taken over a a
[1:31:30] denominational church had asked me
[1:31:32] they'd left the denomination and asked
[1:31:34] him to come pastor and he's pastor and
[1:31:36] he asked me to come down preach for him
[1:31:38] so I went and preached for him and
[1:31:40] walked into church and and you know it's
[1:31:42] it's a group that hears some of the
[1:31:44] women in pants and her hair is cut off
[1:31:45] and different things and some of them
[1:31:47] you know have actually have on dresses
[1:31:49] he's trying to minister his group and
[1:31:51] there's this one elderly woman there
[1:31:53] that was I could tell she is a she's the
[1:31:55] matriarch of the church she was walking
[1:31:57] around and telling everybody and doing
[1:31:59] this in forest service and all these
[1:32:00] things and and uh you know I thought man
[1:32:03] she's in control of this thing and I
[1:32:05] told everyone hey I said he said I
[1:32:08] preached the word and preached the word
[1:32:09] and after I think after three years she
[1:32:11] finally got the hint left I said brother
[1:32:14] from the first time I preached her I was
[1:32:15] trying to get rid of her
[1:32:18] because I recognize that that was a
[1:32:19] problem she wanted to be in control she
[1:32:22] wanted to dictate what was happening in
[1:32:24] the church I could see that so I said
[1:32:26] hey I was hoping she you know either get
[1:32:28] right or get out right I mean that's
[1:32:29] kind of the way it comes down to it get
[1:32:31] it or get out even don't just sit there
[1:32:33] and be a problem amen so sometimes he
[1:32:36] just like hey you know if you're not
[1:32:38] going to get into this thing if you're
[1:32:39] not going to put your shoulder to the
[1:32:40] wheel if you're not going to believe the
[1:32:41] word of God if you're not going to
[1:32:42] believe the truth if you're not going to
[1:32:44] conform to the word of God Amen after a
[1:32:46] certain time hey
[1:32:48] amen adios amen I mean sometimes it's
[1:32:53] better right I'm a no-go pastor we want
[1:32:54] to keep everybody but sometimes it's
[1:32:56] better to say hey Hit the Road Jack
[1:32:59] and don't look back
[1:33:02] right amen just keep going just keep
[1:33:05] going amen so so sometimes that becomes
[1:33:07] fun but he said in the 14th verse let me
[1:33:09] get back to the word of God I shouldn't
[1:33:10] have got awful man Nehemiah y'all got to
[1:33:13] baptism Nehemiah 4 chapter the 14th
[1:33:15] verse and I looked and Rose up and uh
[1:33:18] and said unto the Nobles into the rulers
[1:33:20] into the rest of the people be not
[1:33:22] afraid of them remember the Lord which
[1:33:25] is great and terrible remember the Lord
[1:33:27] don't don't think about them
[1:33:30] don't dwell on them remember the Lord
[1:33:33] which is terrible great and terrible and
[1:33:36] fight
[1:33:37] for your brethren for your sons and for
[1:33:39] your daughters for your wives and for
[1:33:40] your houses you've got something to
[1:33:42] fight for brothers of this assembly
[1:33:44] you've got something to fight for you
[1:33:47] look around at your children you look
[1:33:48] around your wines you look around your
[1:33:50] family you look around at your home
[1:33:51] saying you've got something to fight
[1:33:54] this devil far amen don't you let down
[1:33:56] the standard don't you let down the
[1:33:58] guard don't you let that enemy into your
[1:34:00] home
[1:34:02] amen fine David said fight for your
[1:34:05] brethren amen fight for your your
[1:34:08] families your children your wives and
[1:34:09] your houses put up a fight amen down in
[1:34:12] the 17th verse
[1:34:14] it says they which spilled on the wall
[1:34:16] and they that bear burdens with those
[1:34:19] that laid it everyone
[1:34:21] with one of his hands wrought in the
[1:34:23] work
[1:34:24] and with the other hand held a weapon
[1:34:28] for the builders everyone had his sword
[1:34:32] girded by his side and so builded and
[1:34:36] that he sounded the trumpet was by me
[1:34:38] and so you know what we're going to
[1:34:40] fight but we're going to keep we're
[1:34:41] going to be prepared to fight but we're
[1:34:43] going to keep working see this the devil
[1:34:45] wants to do this the psychological
[1:34:47] warfare again the hinder the work of God
[1:34:49] to keep you from doing what the Lord is
[1:34:50] designated for you to do to get you
[1:34:52] distracted from the things of almighty
[1:34:54] God
[1:34:56] right amen so if he can get you
[1:34:58] distracted from him amen you may be
[1:34:59] standing there amen ready to fight but
[1:35:02] the work's not getting done BMI said hey
[1:35:04] we're going with one hand we're going to
[1:35:06] hold the Sword and the other hand we're
[1:35:06] going to get this work done hey man
[1:35:08] we're going to do it one way if we're
[1:35:09] going to have to do it one-handed we're
[1:35:11] going to do it if but we're going to be
[1:35:12] prepared to fight amen and listen the
[1:35:15] enemy will will he'll push you around
[1:35:17] and he will bully you as long as you let
[1:35:20] him
[1:35:21] but whenever you show that devil that
[1:35:24] you're prepared to stand and fight
[1:35:28] the devil don't want to fight because he
[1:35:31] already knows how that ends he already
[1:35:33] knows who wins that fight
[1:35:36] so he don't want to fight and I want you
[1:35:37] to know something you read the rest this
[1:35:39] you read chapter five amen this week go
[1:35:41] on hey he never they never did attack
[1:35:43] them why because they were prepared to
[1:35:46] fight
[1:35:47] and when you're prepared to fight
[1:35:48] against the enemy amen then the enemy
[1:35:51] said oh I don't think I want to pick
[1:35:53] that fight today see he's he's all buff
[1:35:56] right amen he's Bluff he's all boo but
[1:35:58] when you begin to boo back ain't even
[1:36:01] all of a sudden amen he don't want any
[1:36:02] part of that when you begin to when you
[1:36:04] began to take the word of God when you
[1:36:06] began to take the sword of the spirit
[1:36:08] amen the devil don't want any part of
[1:36:10] that right
[1:36:11] now this this is the word of God
[1:36:14] but whenever all of a sudden the spirit
[1:36:17] of the Lord comes upon you this becomes
[1:36:18] a sword
[1:36:20] it goes from a word to a sword right and
[1:36:22] the enemy don't want any part of that he
[1:36:25] knows that it is defeated he's defeated
[1:36:27] by that word amen
[1:36:30] and so he don't want any part of it so
[1:36:31] that's exactly amen whenever Nehemiah
[1:36:34] said hey we'll work with one hand hold a
[1:36:36] sword the other hand they never did
[1:36:37] attack where was where were they all at
[1:36:39] now
[1:36:40] now
[1:36:41] you know
[1:36:42] our sister flows she sang a song of
[1:36:45] those in that song it referenced back to
[1:36:47] Goliath and I always I I you know you
[1:36:49] can't help but love the story of dating
[1:36:50] your life but do you know that Goliath
[1:36:53] was psychological warfare
[1:36:56] it's big oh he's trying to induce fear
[1:36:58] and it worked right he got into mind see
[1:37:01] the Goliath was easily defeated
[1:37:06] God says let me take my smallest
[1:37:08] untrained

[1:37:13] soldier he's not a warrior let me take
[1:37:16] my smallest Shepherd boy here amen he
[1:37:19] don't have armor he don't have a sword
[1:37:20] he don't have a bow he don't have a
[1:37:22] spear obvious God's a sling and those
[1:37:24] five Stones let me take that though that
[1:37:27] that little chef boy and I'll show you
[1:37:28] amen what's going to happen to that
[1:37:30] giant that is attacking you amen Goliath
[1:37:33] with psychological warfare Goliath was
[1:37:35] easily defeated
[1:37:37] but the fear of Goliath was not
[1:37:40] see that's what was Conquering the army
[1:37:43] of Israel
[1:37:45] it wasn't glad it was the fear of
[1:37:46] Goliath and that's what Satan wants to
[1:37:49] do to you amen he wants to intimidate
[1:37:51] you
[1:37:52] so that you don't fight you don't take a
[1:37:55] stand amen you won't stand for what you
[1:37:57] believe or what the truth is or you will
[1:37:59] you will stand for the promises of God
[1:38:01] you just say well oh oh my you know well
[1:38:04] Grandma had that so I guess I'm gonna
[1:38:05] have that oh no no no no somebody it's
[1:38:08] got to say I'm going to stand up and
[1:38:09] fight
[1:38:10] amen I'm not just going to give in to
[1:38:12] this devil I'm not just going to give in
[1:38:13] he looks big he looks bad but when you
[1:38:16] stand up to him amen he begins to
[1:38:19] dimitish he begins to run praise God
[1:38:21] Amen to the prophet of God said when
[1:38:22] that weakest believer that weakest
[1:38:24] Christian
[1:38:25] maybe you're here this morning and you
[1:38:27] feel like you're the weakest
[1:38:29] but when you get on your knees
[1:38:32] that big bad devil
[1:38:34] he begins to tremble amen he begins to
[1:38:37] tremble because he realizes that any
[1:38:40] moment now that person is going to tap
[1:38:42] in to the king of glory he's going to
[1:38:45] tap in or she's going to tap into that
[1:38:47] eternal power source of almighty God the
[1:38:50] word and the spirit of God is going to
[1:38:51] raise up in her and she's going to
[1:38:53] unsheath a sword
[1:38:56] amen that he has no match for amen do
[1:38:59] you believe that amen so he is defeated
[1:39:01] praise God somebody pull out that sword
[1:39:03] take that word that has been on sheath
[1:39:05] in our day and begin to chop that devil
[1:39:08] into pieces and I'm going to do
[1:39:10] something he won't stick around for a
[1:39:11] fight he will run from you he'll read
[1:39:15] from you but I will tell you something
[1:39:17] it's a hand of faith that welds the
[1:39:20] sword of almighty God don't you be
[1:39:23] afraid to stand on that word and to take
[1:39:26] that enemy and defeat him everywhere
[1:39:29] oh did Brother Andrew he quoted that
[1:39:31] quote
[1:39:32] Look What We Love Oh my he quoted it
[1:39:37] Wednesday night the word of God will
[1:39:39] defeat
[1:39:40] anywhere Anytime Anyplace under any
[1:39:42] conditions it'll defeat that devil right
[1:39:45] amen because it's a spirit of God it's
[1:39:47] not you
[1:39:50] the spirit of God that dwells in you
[1:39:52] because the Bible tells us that this is
[1:39:54] not the sword of Lindsey McGrady or Ron
[1:39:56] Peterson amen or of Russell Wallace or
[1:39:59] or whoever it's the sword of
[1:40:03] the spirit
[1:40:04] and when the spirit of God takes that
[1:40:06] word Satan is no match he is defeated by
[1:40:10] that amen so oh my we're believing the
[1:40:12] word of God so don't let the
[1:40:13] psychological warfare of the devil begin
[1:40:16] to control your thoughts or control your
[1:40:17] mind or or have that amen or scare you
[1:40:19] with these things now now listen I want
[1:40:21] to go real quickly because we're not at
[1:40:23] the end of the story
[1:40:25] let's go to the end of the story just a
[1:40:26] little bit here the the sixth chapter of
[1:40:29] the book of Nehemiah
[1:40:33] and I'm trying to hurry because I know
[1:40:34] you have a baptism today that's
[1:40:36] wonderful
[1:40:37] that's great God bless you and obeying
[1:40:39] the word of God when you obey the word
[1:40:40] of God then God will do what he promised
[1:40:42] he would do
[1:40:44] amen
[1:40:45] Nehemiah the sixth chapter and it says
[1:40:47] in the first verse says now it came to
[1:40:49] pass when sand belonged to buy and guess
[1:40:51] them and the Arabian the rest of the
[1:40:53] enemies heard that I had built the wall
[1:40:55] and that there was no breach left
[1:40:58] therein
[1:41:00] they closed the volume holes
[1:41:02] amen cleared out the rubber amen and
[1:41:05] built the law
[1:41:06] said though at the time I had not set up
[1:41:09] the doors upon the gates so it was still
[1:41:13] a little opening here for the enemy to
[1:41:15] get in
[1:41:16] it says that the second verse that
[1:41:18] sambalot and gesham said unto me and
[1:41:21] said come and let us meet together in
[1:41:24] some of the villages in the plain of Ono
[1:41:26] that they but they thought to do me
[1:41:29] Mischief now so if the devil can't Bluff
[1:41:32] you into quitting
[1:41:34] he wants to talk you into compromising
[1:41:36] he wants to reason with you well
[1:41:39] everybody else is doing it
[1:41:41] it's okay everybody look you know
[1:41:43] so-so's doing it so you know it's hard
[1:41:45] let's say let's we've been we've been
[1:41:47] battling too long now and this you know
[1:41:49] let's just have a compromise because
[1:41:50] you're tired of battle and I'm tired
[1:41:51] let's just compromise that's what the
[1:41:53] devil wants to do
[1:41:54] that's the next step in the
[1:41:56] psychological warfare amen of you if you
[1:42:00] won't believe his blood he said hey
[1:42:03] let's meet together let's compromise
[1:42:05] let's talk about this thing
[1:42:07] hey man how he does it but look here's
[1:42:10] here again is uh it's nehemiah's answers
[1:42:13] in the third verse and I sent message to
[1:42:15] them saying I am doing a great work
[1:42:19] so that cannot come down why should the
[1:42:21] work cease well I'll leave it and come
[1:42:24] down to you amen you know what I ain't
[1:42:26] got time to entertain a compromise I'm
[1:42:28] not going to believe you blessed and I'm
[1:42:30] not going to entertain your compromise
[1:42:32] amen says I'm doing a great work and
[1:42:34] that's what it's about it's about the
[1:42:36] work it's not about your comfort I mean
[1:42:38] it's not about what you want to do it's
[1:42:40] about the work that God has designated
[1:42:42] you to do what he has chosen you to do
[1:42:45] if you want the power of God backing you
[1:42:47] do the work of God do what God has
[1:42:49] called you I'm not talking about you
[1:42:51] don't have to be up here behind the
[1:42:52] pulpit preaching but for every one of us
[1:42:53] God is a purpose and he's called you
[1:42:55] with something to do amen he empowers
[1:42:57] you to do the work that he's called you
[1:43:00] to do
[1:43:01] Nehemiah said I'm not Nehemiah what
[1:43:04] nowhere building him a house
[1:43:06] amen he was he was doing the work for
[1:43:08] God I'm doing a great work and I don't
[1:43:11] have time to deal with you hey man
[1:43:13] that's what we have to do
[1:43:15] amen
[1:43:16] and Nellis in the fourth verse says and
[1:43:18] they said unto me four times after the
[1:43:20] sword and I answered him after the same
[1:43:22] manner
[1:43:23] the devil's persistent if nothing else
[1:43:26] right he just keeps on coming hey just
[1:43:28] let's compromise this and and Nehemiah
[1:43:32] stood on the ground and then we find out
[1:43:34] here the the fifth verse down to the
[1:43:37] ninth verse that sambalot he again
[1:43:39] changed his tactic because he sent a
[1:43:41] messenger unto uh under the amount with
[1:43:44] an open letter that they were under the
[1:43:46] pretense I'm going to send to the king
[1:43:47] saying you know what you're here in
[1:43:49] defiance of the king and you're trying
[1:43:51] to set up a kingdom and you're going to
[1:43:52] be the king and and you're God you're
[1:43:54] getting a prophet or prophets a prophet
[1:43:56] to preach to you
[1:43:59] and so the Bible tells me that the devil
[1:44:02] is a liar that there's no truth in him
[1:44:04] and that's what he wants to do he starts
[1:44:06] a smear campaign
[1:44:08] Amen to discredit you amen that's what
[1:44:12] he's doing here amen he's here I say hey
[1:44:14] he's not going to bleed my bluff he's
[1:44:16] not going to compromise and say not now
[1:44:18] I'm going to threaten him hey if you
[1:44:20] don't stop this if you don't stop what
[1:44:22] you're doing if you don't stop that
[1:44:23] praying if you don't stop fasting if you
[1:44:24] don't stop seeking God if you don't stop
[1:44:26] going to church I mean if you don't hey
[1:44:27] just compromise well you'll have to go
[1:44:29] every Sunday
[1:44:30] you don't have to go to midweek Services
[1:44:31] compromise just a little bit hey man if
[1:44:33] you won't compromise he says well you
[1:44:35] know what I'm gonna start threatening
[1:44:37] them now amen we're going to turn you in
[1:44:39] we're going to tell people amen and he
[1:44:42] starts that and so that's what he's
[1:44:43] doing and and DMI says hey there's no
[1:44:45] truth to this this lie that is being
[1:44:48] perpetrated amen against us now here's
[1:44:52] here it is we're we're down in the 15th
[1:44:55] verse in Nehemiah 6 chapter it says so
[1:44:57] the wall was
[1:44:59] finished
[1:45:01] in the 25th day of the month of elul in
[1:45:05] 50 and two days
[1:45:07] now look at this the 16th verse and it
[1:45:09] came to mass that when our enemies
[1:45:13] sambala tobiah the Arabians the
[1:45:16] ammonites all the herd of thereof hurt
[1:45:20] them and of the Heathen that were about
[1:45:23] to solve these things they were much
[1:45:26] cast down in their own eyes
[1:45:30] for they perceive that this work was
[1:45:32] wrought of our God
[1:45:34] and so you know what I said here wait a
[1:45:35] minute oh now they their their tactic
[1:45:39] was hey let's defeat them let's
[1:45:41] discourage them but now they saw the
[1:45:43] work being accomplished and now they're
[1:45:45] the ones that are cast down instead of
[1:45:48] them putting you know Nehemiah and the
[1:45:50] Jews to flee now they're the ones that's
[1:45:52] recognize hey this we tried to stop him
[1:45:55] and we couldn't do it amen because this
[1:45:57] work was not of uh of uh evening Light
[1:46:01] Fellowship this work was of almighty God
[1:46:03] this was a just a phase amen I remember
[1:46:06] when I come out of that Methodist church
[1:46:08] amen has come around to the truth you
[1:46:11] know it's a face he's going to he's he's
[1:46:12] just 18 years old well guess what that's
[1:46:15] been good for 40 years now
[1:46:18] amen the face has been going on for 40
[1:46:21] years and it's not getting any less
[1:46:23] praise God and see that's what the enemy
[1:46:25] says well hey it's just a phase they're
[1:46:27] going through but when they realize hey
[1:46:29] this and that's what my parents thought
[1:46:31] when I'm coming in and saying well why
[1:46:32] did my mom look at this word here we
[1:46:34] didn't we didn't find this out in the
[1:46:35] Methodist Church we didn't they didn't
[1:46:37] teach us in this semester the church
[1:46:38] look at this oh this is he's got to mix
[1:46:40] up with some Fanatics and and it's just
[1:46:42] a phase he's going through and you know
[1:46:44] what after a few years
[1:46:47] yeah
[1:46:49] mama and daddy
[1:46:53] let me take them to the baptistry down
[1:46:56] in the river and baptize them because
[1:46:58] they realized hey this ain't the work of
[1:47:00] a man amen this is the work of of the
[1:47:03] Lord hallelujah
[1:47:05] and I want you to know God's not
[1:47:06] finished yet praise God what he did for
[1:47:09] me he'll do for you what he did in my
[1:47:11] family he can do for your family don't
[1:47:13] you think ain't no two guns are too fine
[1:47:15] God will Amaze you at what he can do you
[1:47:18] hold steady you keep working the work
[1:47:20] amen you keep doing the work of God you
[1:47:23] keep standing on the word of almighty
[1:47:25] God and God will show you that child
[1:47:27] that is what I've done strength one day
[1:47:28] they're going to have a they're gonna
[1:47:30] have an eye-opening experience hey that
[1:47:31] ain't that ain't the work of man that's
[1:47:33] the work of almighty God Amen and God's
[1:47:36] gonna do the work Hallelujah now come to
[1:47:38] it you've got to stand on the word
[1:47:40] you've got to believe the word amen
[1:47:44] if the devil gets you to compromise if
[1:47:47] then what what the devil does when you
[1:47:49] start compromising
[1:47:51] the devil begins over there
[1:47:53] and starts whispering
[1:47:56] see I told you this hypocritical I told
[1:47:59] you it wasn't true I told you this just
[1:48:01] just religious that's what happens when
[1:48:04] you begin to compromise when you stand
[1:48:06] on the word of God there come a day
[1:48:10] that they're going to have to recognize
[1:48:13] this is true
[1:48:14] true this is true everything in the
[1:48:16] world is changing everything around them
[1:48:18] is changing amen all these things are
[1:48:20] going on but they stayed steady with the
[1:48:22] word of God they've not changed they uh
[1:48:25] they're more like Jesus Christ today
[1:48:27] than they've ever been amen you hold on
[1:48:30] to that word don't you compromise don't
[1:48:32] you let the devil begin to play
[1:48:34] psychological warfare with your loved
[1:48:36] ones well
[1:48:37] look at that compromised
[1:48:39] oh they say they're a Christian amen the
[1:48:42] work was done and the enemy was cast
[1:48:46] down in his own eyes and he perceived
[1:48:49] this work is of the Lord amen I'm going
[1:48:52] to bring this down until close II
[1:48:54] Corinthians it don't matter how many
[1:48:55] quotes and scriptures I've got I'm just
[1:48:57] usually good for an hour second Chris
[1:48:59] The more I've got the faster I had to
[1:49:01] preach but it still can't preach if I
[1:49:02] said brother Andrew and so II
[1:49:04] Corinthians the 10th chapter we know
[1:49:05] these verses very well it says for
[1:49:07] though we walk in the flesh
[1:49:11] we do not war
[1:49:13] after the flesh
[1:49:16] you cannot beat Satan at his game
[1:49:20] you cannot defeat Satan in a carnal
[1:49:24] reasoning mind that is his Battleground
[1:49:28] and that's what he wants to get you on
[1:49:29] he wants to get you to come hey come on
[1:49:32] my territory come on my ground and let's
[1:49:35] begin to reason amen let's begin to talk
[1:49:37] about this let's begin to Hash this out
[1:49:40] you can't fight him on his ground
[1:49:42] amen you've got to stand upon your upon
[1:49:45] your ground you've got to stand with the
[1:49:47] word of almighty God see brother random
[1:49:49] he said you know that that in the Garden
[1:49:51] of Eden God chose a part of man and the
[1:49:54] devil chose a part of man God chose the
[1:49:56] heart but the devil chose to intellect
[1:49:58] so he wants us to begin to fight anyway
[1:50:00] in fact that quote from Abraham's
[1:50:02] Covenant confirmed brother Graham says
[1:50:04] the devil chose zenilex and now today
[1:50:06] the church today depends on everything
[1:50:09] upon the intellect
[1:50:12] we can't we can't be there we can't go
[1:50:14] that it's not just how many quotes do
[1:50:16] you know it's not just that I will quote
[1:50:19] a quote and so forth that you know what
[1:50:20] the devil's not scared of that quote you
[1:50:22] remember over the book of Acts the 19th
[1:50:24] Chapter that there was some Vagabond
[1:50:26] Jews you remember them
[1:50:28] and they had they had witnessed Paul
[1:50:30] ministering that witness Paul casting
[1:50:32] out devils and so these seven sons of
[1:50:34] Stephen they get this Bright Idea hey
[1:50:36] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna do
[1:50:38] what Paul did we're gonna say and they
[1:50:39] go up to a man demon Spirit uh possessed
[1:50:42] by demon and says hey we endure thee by
[1:50:45] Paul by Jesus Christ who Paul preaches
[1:50:50] when that demon says hey
[1:50:52] Paul I know
[1:50:54] and Jesus I know
[1:50:56] but who are you in other words that
[1:50:58] demon says I don't recognize any power
[1:51:01] or any Authority in you to take control
[1:51:03] over me it's not you we don't defeat the
[1:51:06] Devil by intellect we don't defeat the
[1:51:08] Devil amen by playing mind games amen We
[1:51:11] Stand upon the word of God by the spirit
[1:51:14] of almighty God Amen and the devil is
[1:51:16] defeated Hallelujah he's already
[1:51:18] defeated right
[1:51:20] hey man so you don't defeat him in your
[1:51:23] on your in your own ability not by might
[1:51:26] nor by power but by my spirit saith Lord
[1:51:28] hosts again it's a it's a spirit of God
[1:51:30] that takes the word of God Amen and
[1:51:32] begins to defeat the enemy praise Lord
[1:51:34] so that's why it's important not that
[1:51:35] you just know a quote amen or know a
[1:51:38] Bible verse but you've got to know the
[1:51:39] author
[1:51:40] you're going to have him living on the
[1:51:42] inside because that is the authority
[1:51:44] that Satan recognizes see I can take the
[1:51:47] word but without the uh but without the
[1:51:50] power of spirit see in the in the Bible
[1:51:52] the Bible talks about two words or in
[1:51:54] the New Testament in degree it has
[1:51:55] typically two words are used to Greek
[1:51:59] words are used for the word power that
[1:52:00] is translated into the English language
[1:52:03] one is dunamis dynamite explosive power
[1:52:06] of force amen that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:52:09] does in you but the other word is exosia
[1:52:12] which is Authority
[1:52:14] so whatever you stand out with the word
[1:52:16] of God
[1:52:17] amen with the spirit of God Amen you're
[1:52:21] standing there with the dunamis and the
[1:52:24] Ecstasy you're standing there with the
[1:52:26] power and the authority to defeat that
[1:52:29] devil and the devil recognizes that
[1:52:31] nobody wants to stand up to that devil
[1:52:33] oh Jesus I know Paul I know the prophet
[1:52:37] of God William radham I know but who are
[1:52:39] you
[1:52:39] oh no the God we serve the god that's
[1:52:42] only inside of me
[1:52:43] I may not have the same gift or the same
[1:52:46] calling as a prophet of God but I got
[1:52:48] the same God that he had and so do you
[1:52:50] right
[1:52:51] amen I'm not called to be a a church age
[1:52:54] Messenger to be a word Prophet amen I'm
[1:52:57] not that amen but I have the god
[1:53:00] amen that stood there and said thus
[1:53:02] saith the Lord amen the same God he's
[1:53:05] here today he's not a a piece of History
[1:53:08] he's not somebody that hey we're just
[1:53:11] reminisce about we tell about and what
[1:53:13] he did in the 50s and the 60s or the 40s
[1:53:15] amen but he's the same in the 21st
[1:53:17] century he's still saving he's still
[1:53:20] healing he's still delivering praise God
[1:53:22] that's the God we serve amen
[1:53:25] hallelujah amen it's that God so what
[1:53:29] does it saying for though we walk in the
[1:53:31] flesh we do not war after the flesh
[1:53:34] for the weapons of our Warfare they are
[1:53:36] not carnal you're not fighting this
[1:53:39] Devil with a carnal ability or your mind
[1:53:41] amen But Mighty they're Mighty through
[1:53:44] God that are pulling down our
[1:53:45] strongholds our weapon our weapons are
[1:53:49] Mighty through God to the pulling down
[1:53:51] of strongholds that strongholds the
[1:53:53] place that Satan wants to every time
[1:53:54] that I mean all of a sudden you start
[1:53:55] feeling good and you start feeling
[1:53:57] religious and you start feeling the
[1:53:59] presence of God that devil wants to go
[1:54:01] back that stronghold oh remember when
[1:54:02] you were 17 years old and you got out of
[1:54:04] church and and and and and and
[1:54:07] that's a stronghold right now but we
[1:54:10] thank God we've got a weapon Amen to
[1:54:13] those toys solve those strongholds amen
[1:54:16] that says hey if we confess us he is
[1:54:17] faithful and just to forgive our sins
[1:54:19] and he cleans us from all
[1:54:20] unrighteousness amen he don't even
[1:54:21] remember it anymore he can't be found on
[1:54:24] the books anymore amen it has been
[1:54:26] buried behind you and the devil's the
[1:54:29] only thing he do he's trying to Bluff
[1:54:30] you he's playing psychological warfare
[1:54:33] with you telling you amen oh you
[1:54:35] remember what you did
[1:54:37] you remember your marriage failed you
[1:54:39] remembered amen what you did as a young
[1:54:41] man or a young woman or this or that
[1:54:44] ah but thank God the weapons of our
[1:54:46] Warfare
[1:54:48] amen they are not carnal because if it's
[1:54:51] just carnal we'll lose
[1:54:53] but they are Mighty through God
[1:54:56] to the pulling down of the strongholds
[1:54:59] you do not have to be bound by that
[1:55:02] psychological warfare of the enemy any
[1:55:05] longer
[1:55:06] telling you you're not good enough or
[1:55:09] you made this mistake or you made too
[1:55:11] many mistakes or you know you've done
[1:55:13] this you've done that you don't have to
[1:55:14] be a prisoner to the psychological
[1:55:16] warfare anymore
[1:55:19] amen because we've got weapons
[1:55:22] and the strongholds are defeated the
[1:55:24] last verse casting down imaginations
[1:55:28] that's what we're supposed to do here
[1:55:30] comes the psychological warfare
[1:55:33] cast them down
[1:55:35] cast it down and every High thing that
[1:55:37] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[1:55:39] God
[1:55:40] amen if he's saying it if it's against
[1:55:42] the word of God you cast that down
[1:55:45] amen has no part of you and bringing
[1:55:47] into captivity every thought thought to
[1:55:49] The Obedience of Christ as the musicians
[1:55:53] come back

[1:55:56] it's a psychological warfare every one
[1:55:58] of us are engaged in that thing don't
[1:55:59] matter how young you are how old you are
[1:56:01] the enemy is attacking your mind the
[1:56:05] enemy is trying to give thoughts into
[1:56:07] your mind he's trying to control you
[1:56:09] through that thought process he's trying
[1:56:12] to cause you to have doubts and fears
[1:56:14] and not to believe the word of God
[1:56:17] that's psychological warfare that we're
[1:56:18] in I mean it's what's going on I read an
[1:56:22] interesting little statement

[1:56:26] you've probably heard this brother on
[1:56:28] somebody else has probably stood up here
[1:56:29] but if if you have it's worth repeating
[1:56:33] it said that ships
[1:56:36] do not sink
[1:56:38] because of the water around them
[1:56:41] ships sink because of the water that
[1:56:43] gets into them
[1:56:45] don't let what's happening around you
[1:56:48] get inside you
[1:56:52] and pull you down
[1:56:54] the ship
[1:56:55] it was designed to sell through the
[1:57:00] storm and you were designed by almighty
[1:57:04] God

[2:06:57] what a mighty God we have we see it
[2:06:59] through the scripture psychological
[2:07:01] warfare
[2:07:02] we know that this is the biggest age of
[2:07:06] mental issues
[2:07:09] mental pressure stress
[2:07:12] and issues I mean a working man takes
[2:07:15] off his tools
[2:07:17] drops his pouches and he doesn't pick
[2:07:19] him up to the next day
[2:07:21] but the vast majority of people today
[2:07:23] work with their mind and they go home
[2:07:26] with the burdens and then they're
[2:07:28] they're on their cell phone and they're
[2:07:30] still connected and then they try to go
[2:07:33] to sleep how do you take your mind out
[2:07:36] and set it on a shelf so you can get
[2:07:39] some rest
[2:07:40] and some of you now brother Branham
[2:07:42] talks about he said some of you you are
[2:07:45] all these overthinkers
[2:07:47] you're always trying to cross the bridge
[2:07:49] before you get there and well what if
[2:07:51] and and if it doesn't and then and then
[2:07:54] you know and
[2:07:55] it never works out that way anyway when
[2:07:58] you get there it's nothing like you
[2:08:00] thought
[2:08:01] and you don't waste it all that time and
[2:08:03] fret and worry and stuff hey when we get
[2:08:06] there he's Jehovah Jairus
[2:08:09] he's a God that meets every need
