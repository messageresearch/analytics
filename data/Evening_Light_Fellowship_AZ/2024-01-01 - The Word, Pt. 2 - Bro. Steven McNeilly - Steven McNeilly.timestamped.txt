[59:26] of God that was the True Light which
[59:28] lith every man that cometh into the
[59:30] world he was in the world and the world
[59:33] was made by him and the world knew him
[59:36] not he came onto his own and his own
[59:39] received him not but as many as received
[59:42] him to them he gave power gave he power
[59:45] to become the sons of God even to them
[59:48] that believe on his name which were born
[59:51] not of blood nor of the will of the
[59:54] flesh nor of the will of man praise the
[59:56] Lord but of God and the Word was made
[59:59] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:00:02] his glory as the glory as of the only
[1:00:05] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:00:10] truth amen you may be seated this
[1:00:14] morning and we trust that the Lord will
[1:00:16] add the blessing to the reading of the
[1:00:18] word I would like to title my thought
[1:00:21] this morning and speak on the word and
[1:00:24] and this is part two and I would like to
[1:00:27] take for a subject the word was made
[1:00:30] flesh and dwelt Among Us and I just want
[1:00:34] to add to that and say that the word is
[1:00:37] still flesh and dwelling amongst
[1:00:41] us now when we read our Bibles we
[1:00:45] understand that this book that we call
[1:00:47] the Bible it it is the very mind the
[1:00:50] very concept it is the very Eternal
[1:00:54] thoughts of God
[1:00:55] himself and it is God's way of making
[1:00:59] known to us his ways and so if we ever
[1:01:03] have a question about God if we ever
[1:01:05] have a question about his ways or his
[1:01:08] thoughts on a certain subject it's very
[1:01:11] easy for us to find out what the answer
[1:01:14] is all we have to do is look in the word
[1:01:18] I find that we're living in an age where
[1:01:21] uh we think Google has all of the
[1:01:23] answers
[1:01:25] we think that A1 or AI whatever it's
[1:01:27] called has all the answers but let me
[1:01:30] tell you something something that is
[1:01:32] made by man does not have all the
[1:01:34] answers only God himself has all the
[1:01:38] answers we see that we're living in a
[1:01:40] day where AI is like taking over the
[1:01:43] entire
[1:01:44] world I just wonder now you know that
[1:01:47] you can type in certain keywords into Ai
[1:01:50] and you can type in a subject or
[1:01:52] whatever you want and they'll bring up a
[1:01:54] complete subject for you on whatever it
[1:01:56] is that you're wanting to talk about and
[1:01:59] I thought my I wonder uh who's going to
[1:02:02] be the first AI preacher within the
[1:02:04] message typing in some keywords typing
[1:02:08] this in and that in and all of a sudden
[1:02:09] there's a complete sermon that's written
[1:02:11] out for this Minister and uh for him to
[1:02:15] preach to the
[1:02:16] people how important it is for us as
[1:02:19] ministers to stay Upon Our Knees to get
[1:02:22] our own Revelation to get our own
[1:02:25] inspiration that when we come before the
[1:02:27] people that we have something to give
[1:02:30] not something that has been written up
[1:02:32] by some mechanical device but an
[1:02:35] inspiration of God Almighty because it's
[1:02:38] the inspiration of God that changes Our
[1:02:40] Lives it's the inspiration of God that
[1:02:43] breaks the yolks that breaks the the the
[1:02:46] chains that have us bound
[1:02:49] amen you say brother Steven there's no
[1:02:51] way that's going to
[1:02:53] happen I guarantee it will you'll get a
[1:02:56] young man or an old man whoever it may
[1:02:59] be that really wants to do something for
[1:03:01] God that really that really uh wishes
[1:03:04] that he was called to the
[1:03:06] ministry before we know it uh they have
[1:03:10] sermons written up for them God help
[1:03:15] us to have
[1:03:17] discernment to know when a man is called
[1:03:20] of God or not to have discernment to
[1:03:23] know when a man has a a thought that has
[1:03:25] been sent from God to give to his people
[1:03:29] cuz understand the thought the uh the
[1:03:32] sermon that God gives the man is not for
[1:03:35] the man it's for God's children it's for
[1:03:39] the needs that's within the assembly
[1:03:41] amen that was free right
[1:03:44] now so we see that brother brandham told
[1:03:47] us that God was this great uh eternal
[1:03:51] spirit that filled all space and until
[1:03:54] finally uh brother brandham said it was
[1:03:56] like that little Ray of sunlight right
[1:03:58] that little that little Halo that came
[1:04:00] out of God and and brother brandham said
[1:04:02] that that was the word of God he said
[1:04:05] that was the son of God it was the logos
[1:04:07] in one place he says that that was the
[1:04:11] uh uh the angel of the Covenant there's
[1:04:14] many many titles that he gives this but
[1:04:16] we understand if we could break it down
[1:04:18] into one thing that it was God Amen it
[1:04:22] was the concept the very lugus of God
[1:04:25] and we see that it was not another
[1:04:28] person within the godhead but it was God
[1:04:33] himself God beginning to condescend down
[1:04:37] to his people yet in another form amen
[1:04:41] so we find out that as he was in this
[1:04:44] form he began to create according to
[1:04:47] John chap 1 and verse three it says that
[1:04:50] all things were made by him and all
[1:04:53] things were made for for him in one
[1:04:55] place in the Scripture it says that all
[1:04:57] things were made by him and for his
[1:05:00] purpose so we find that whenever God be
[1:05:03] to create he had a purpose behind what
[1:05:06] he was saying God is Not uh a god of
[1:05:10] just of of a lot of words that gets out
[1:05:12] here and just says a lot of words that
[1:05:15] have no meaning behind it but God is a
[1:05:17] very purposeful God that whenever he
[1:05:20] speaks something he has a plan for that
[1:05:23] for those words to come to pass and so
[1:05:26] when God began to create and he said let
[1:05:28] there be light and let there be this and
[1:05:31] and let there be this and so on and so
[1:05:33] forth we find that God had a reason for
[1:05:36] those things in which he was speaking
[1:05:39] because he would use all of these things
[1:05:42] according to his purpose that he had
[1:05:44] within his mind you and I are no
[1:05:48] different my brother and my sister God
[1:05:50] has made us for a reason for a purpose
[1:05:53] and that is to serve him it's not to
[1:05:56] just serve the world it's not to just uh
[1:05:59] make as much money as we can or whatever
[1:06:01] it may be but he has spoken us here at
[1:06:04] this very time that we might be a light
[1:06:07] in a dark place that we might let our
[1:06:10] lights shine to a dark and dying world
[1:06:15] Amen so when we look at these things
[1:06:17] whether it be the things in the natural
[1:06:19] the trees the birds and the Animals
[1:06:21] whatever it may be are the things that
[1:06:23] we do na see the Unseen forces that are
[1:06:26] around us such as gravity and all the
[1:06:29] different things that are unseen we find
[1:06:31] that it all came together for one
[1:06:34] purpose because God said
[1:06:39] so nothing came into existence unless
[1:06:43] God said
[1:06:45] so and When God Says something we find
[1:06:48] out that there's nothing that can
[1:06:50] prevent it from happening why because
[1:06:53] God God said so follow me with brother
[1:06:57] Bram 1956 a second-handed robe he says
[1:07:01] uh go into the room and I knelt down I
[1:07:03] said I I want to speak to her alone and
[1:07:06] I go into the room to pray with the
[1:07:08] woman and while in the room I thought oh
[1:07:10] God if you'll just show me a vision of
[1:07:13] what's going to happen to the woman Mr
[1:07:16] and Miss Wood sitting on the outside
[1:07:18] waiting to see what the vision would say
[1:07:20] you see they had all been gotten uh uh
[1:07:24] so reliant on the visions of God in
[1:07:26] brother branham's life they were all
[1:07:28] waiting for a
[1:07:30] vision but while I was in there I got
[1:07:34] condemned I was condemned by waiting for
[1:07:36] a vision seemed like something referred
[1:07:39] back wasn't the calling what you need a
[1:07:42] vision when the promise is already been
[1:07:45] said but they had been so um climatized
[1:07:50] isn't the right word but they they've
[1:07:52] been so conditioned by the gift in
[1:07:54] brother branham's life that that's what
[1:07:56] they were needing they were needing a
[1:07:58] vision they were needing an answer for
[1:08:00] God even brother brandham himself when
[1:08:03] he's saying the answer already laid
[1:08:06] within the word
[1:08:08] hallelujah amen we've been so
[1:08:11] conditioned even
[1:08:13] ourselves oh we need someone to lay
[1:08:15] hands on us we need this to happen we
[1:08:17] need that to happen no the answer is
[1:08:19] already written within the word so I
[1:08:22] knelt down and I pray
[1:08:24] prayed uh and while praying something
[1:08:27] just anchored on the inside the faith of
[1:08:30] the promise my we could preach a sermon
[1:08:32] on that the faith of the promise cuz God
[1:08:36] has given to every one of us precious
[1:08:39] and wonderful promises that's written
[1:08:41] within his word that we just need to
[1:08:43] reach out by faith not seeing a vision
[1:08:46] not something great or whatever no just
[1:08:49] simple Faith am amen he said I come back
[1:08:53] out and Miss Wood uh when I told her
[1:08:56] about it she said did you see anything
[1:08:58] brother brandom I said I never exactly
[1:09:01] seen anything but I felt something that
[1:09:03] told me that his promise was true and he
[1:09:06] was going to do it and I believe that
[1:09:09] he's going to do it and in less than 24
[1:09:11] hours the end that cancer begin to break
[1:09:13] away and a scab form over it cancers
[1:09:16] don't scab as you know unless it's dead
[1:09:20] so there it was now and the woman is
[1:09:22] healed and home what a wonderful Christ
[1:09:26] by keeping our eyes on the promise God
[1:09:30] said so what good advice that is for us
[1:09:34] at the end of a year going into another
[1:09:36] year keeping our eyes on the Promises of
[1:09:39] God why because God said so the man
[1:09:42] didn't say so not because the preacher
[1:09:45] said so but because God said
[1:09:48] soise
[1:09:50] God and he says uh keep your eye in the
[1:09:53] promise God said so that settles it
[1:09:56] that's all of it if God said so God is
[1:10:00] able to keep his promise or he would
[1:10:02] never make it because he is not a God
[1:10:06] that will lie if God makes a promise to
[1:10:09] US Written within his word guess what
[1:10:11] God is going to keep that
[1:10:15] promise 25 years stood on the impossible
[1:10:19] because he counted God was able to
[1:10:22] perform what he had promised amen and we
[1:10:26] are the children of
[1:10:28] Abraham God said
[1:10:31] so he's written it within his word great
[1:10:35] and precious promises what is it God
[1:10:37] said
[1:10:39] so people ask us and they say well why
[1:10:42] is it that your wife dresses it the way
[1:10:45] she does and the people within your
[1:10:47] church and I don't know if you've ever
[1:10:49] looked up the reviews on our church on
[1:10:51] uh on Google might the Google thing you
[1:10:54] know and you can look up reviews and you
[1:10:55] can see what people say when they come
[1:10:57] to visit and everything and there was
[1:10:59] one person and they it they wrote from
[1:11:01] what I remember oh it's a nice church
[1:11:03] but you know the women they they all
[1:11:05] wear skirts and the women they they all
[1:11:07] wear Cardigans and they all have long
[1:11:10] hair and I look out and I see you know
[1:11:12] 80% of the women wearing Cardigans it's
[1:11:14] a true
[1:11:15] review maybe we need to turn the air
[1:11:17] down a little
[1:11:19] bit or maybe it's because we have some
[1:11:22] kind of Revelation of God's word that we
[1:11:26] say ah I have an answer for you there's
[1:11:29] a reason why the the the sisters and the
[1:11:31] women and our wives in the church
[1:11:33] dressed like this because God said so he
[1:11:36] didn't necessarily say that we should
[1:11:38] wear
[1:11:39] Cardigans but he did say that a woman
[1:11:42] should dress in modest apparel he did
[1:11:45] say that it was an Abomination for a
[1:11:47] woman to put on a garment to pertains to
[1:11:49] a man and vice
[1:11:52] versa sometimes times we leave that out
[1:11:54] for us guys don't
[1:11:57] we why why do they have such long hair
[1:12:01] because God said so that's right amen
[1:12:04] First Corinthians we can read it where
[1:12:06] the woman's hair was given to her as a
[1:12:09] covering not just some little hat that's
[1:12:12] not her covering but it's her hair and
[1:12:15] not only is it given for a covering but
[1:12:18] has given to her for her
[1:12:21] glory amen it's a glorious thing yes for
[1:12:25] a woman not to trim her hair because
[1:12:29] that word Glory it is a form of worship
[1:12:32] yes it's not some Creed that's been
[1:12:35] given by man it's not some man-made idea
[1:12:39] where brother brandom and and and and
[1:12:41] the the Holiness movement was trying to
[1:12:44] uh put their their hands uh uh upon the
[1:12:48] women like this and tell them what to do
[1:12:50] no no no no no come on it's a reev
[1:12:54] ation of the word of God that God said
[1:12:58] so it's good enough that's good enough
[1:13:01] for me it's good enough for brother Dave
[1:13:04] is it good enough for
[1:13:06] you and so when someone asks you a
[1:13:09] question and they say why do you do what
[1:13:12] you do the simple response is because
[1:13:16] God said so and that Saddles
[1:13:20] it some might say that that's a a little
[1:13:23] bit
[1:13:24] oldfashioned it's a little bit
[1:13:26] oldfashioned that the guys are all clean
[1:13:29] cut and this and that and the women and
[1:13:31] this and that I tend to disagree that
[1:13:34] it's old-fashioned because God cannot
[1:13:36] become
[1:13:38] oldfashioned God is not oldfashioned but
[1:13:41] I want to tell you that God is always in
[1:13:44] fashion because he is always present he
[1:13:47] is the god of the I am he is the god of
[1:13:50] the now and so if he is ever present he
[1:13:53] is is always in fashion amen God is a
[1:13:57] fashion
[1:13:59] maker I want to ask you this morning
[1:14:01] whose fashion are you following are you
[1:14:03] following the fashion of the world or
[1:14:05] are you following God's fashion I want
[1:14:07] to follow the fashion of God am whether
[1:14:10] the world thinks it's cool or
[1:14:14] not
[1:14:17] amen so we see that when we walk by
[1:14:21] faith we're not walking by faith as
[1:14:24] blind
[1:14:25] people faith is not walking
[1:14:28] blindly faith is not walking with your
[1:14:30] head in the ground and saying well
[1:14:32] perhaps it might happen but perhaps it
[1:14:35] may not happen that is not Faith but
[1:14:38] brother brandham says it uh this way
[1:14:41] that faith is bold y faith is a
[1:14:44] revelation and so when we have a
[1:14:47] revelation of something that's written
[1:14:49] within the word we don't have to shy
[1:14:51] away from it we don't have to uh think
[1:14:54] well maybe it will or maybe it won't but
[1:14:56] when God gives it to you you can walk
[1:14:59] with an assurance because God said so
[1:15:02] it's been revealed to your heart so what
[1:15:04] do we do then we just keep
[1:15:07] walking we don't have to be wandering
[1:15:09] and waiting we can just say father I
[1:15:12] believe it's true you said so that
[1:15:15] settles it therefore I'm going to
[1:15:17] continue walking until the promise comes
[1:15:19] to
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:21] pass that's what we been
[1:15:24] doing we've been walking by faith
[1:15:27] they've been talking about the coming of
[1:15:29] the Lord since the days of
[1:15:32] Paul oh he hasn't come yet oh he's come
[1:15:37] and you've already missed it
[1:15:39] nonsense so just because he hasn't come
[1:15:41] yet does that mean he's not going to
[1:15:44] come it just means when he does come oh
[1:15:47] how sweet it's going to be that's right
[1:15:50] I'm reminded of that story of brother br
[1:15:53] him and he tells of the lady and uh and
[1:15:56] the guy promised her he said I'll be
[1:15:58] back huh you remember the
[1:16:01] story you remember and everybody made
[1:16:04] fun of her and she prepared and she got
[1:16:07] ready you know weddings are the most
[1:16:09] glorious stressful uh days of people's
[1:16:14] lives you can't I can't wait until I got
[1:16:17] married and in the week of the marriage
[1:16:19] I can't wait until this is over with
[1:16:24] why because we get so caught up in the
[1:16:26] small details we get so caught up in
[1:16:29] this and so caught up in that when we
[1:16:31] forget to enjoy the moment Bethany and
[1:16:34] Nick you're next enjoy the moment don't
[1:16:38] get all stressed out about things that's
[1:16:40] how it is with God guess what but it's a
[1:16:43] type where we're we get so uh uh
[1:16:47] stressed because we want to prepare and
[1:16:49] we want to prepare
[1:16:51] right God has given us a word amen that
[1:16:56] we don't have to stress out over
[1:16:58] it all we got to do is believe it and
[1:17:01] say father I'm clothing myself in it and
[1:17:04] I'm preparing myself though she was
[1:17:07] tased though she though people said oh
[1:17:10] he never promised to you we never seen
[1:17:12] it happen we've never seen this guy
[1:17:15] before that's the world it doesn't
[1:17:18] matter what they say all that matters is
[1:17:20] what you believe in your heart and God
[1:17:23] has revealed to you that one day he is
[1:17:28] coming it might be 50 years it might be
[1:17:31] a hundred years and it might be tomorrow
[1:17:35] but I'm going to live my life every day
[1:17:37] as if he's coming today or tomorrow
[1:17:44] amen God said so and that settles it
[1:17:49] it's kind of interesting we're all
[1:17:51] telling our pastor brother on you need
[1:17:53] to rest up you need to rest get some
[1:17:56] rest and get your strength back I want
[1:17:58] to speak to Ruth here this morning what

[1:18:23] worried about wars worried about the
[1:18:24] president hey it isn't our job to worry
[1:18:28] about these
[1:18:30] things the worrying should be over
[1:18:34] because we've moved to our final resting
[1:18:37] place and that's resting in the promises
[1:18:39] of
[1:18:40] God that's tell yourself I'm

[1:19:12] or butts but I'm going to trust in God
[1:19:16] Almighty amen
[1:19:18] amen so we find when we read the Old
[1:19:21] Testament that it is a sh
[1:19:23] of the New Testament the voice of the
[1:19:25] sign 1964 brother Bram says I'm a
[1:19:27] typologist certainly I have no education
[1:19:30] I have to look back and see what he did
[1:19:33] do and we are taught that the Old
[1:19:36] Testament was a shadow of things that is
[1:19:38] to come so if I looked here and never
[1:19:41] seen my hand and I seen the shadow of my
[1:19:44] hand and I had five fingers I'd have
[1:19:46] some good idea that when my hand got
[1:19:49] there I had five fingers so what
[1:19:51] happened to them was examples of of how
[1:19:53] God does things the way he does it now
[1:19:57] so we find out that our Old Testament
[1:20:00] scripture cuz remember we're talking
[1:20:02] about the word and so the word in the
[1:20:05] Old Testament it was a shadow of things
[1:20:09] that was to come it wasn't just the
[1:20:12] history of Israel or the life stories of
[1:20:15] David and all these different men that
[1:20:17] we can read about but it's a shadow of
[1:20:20] something that was to come and be
[1:20:22] fulfilled at a certain time now brother
[1:20:24] brandham says if I see my shadow and I
[1:20:28] never see my hand if you guys could see
[1:20:30] my the shadow of my hand here it looks
[1:20:33] just like my
[1:20:34] hand but the further away the shadow is
[1:20:38] the fuzzier the image is right so I
[1:20:42] could look at it way up here and two
[1:20:43] fingers if I was the size of brother
[1:20:46] Robert it would be fuzzier and fuzzier
[1:20:49] right but for me it looks pretty plain
[1:20:53] cuz I got short
[1:20:55] arms but it's right here and as I look
[1:20:58] at it it's pretty it's pretty fuzzy but
[1:21:01] as the image becomes closer and closer
[1:21:04] you find out that the image of the
[1:21:06] Shadow now it becomes more clear and
[1:21:09] more clear so we find out within the Old
[1:21:12] Testament that it was a shadow of the
[1:21:14] coming
[1:21:16] Messiah whether we look at the life of
[1:21:18] David we can see David uh a a rejected
[1:21:22] King
[1:21:23] and here he was rejected and he was
[1:21:24] chased off from his son and the
[1:21:26] different ones that rebelled against him
[1:21:28] and he was a shadow of a rejected King
[1:21:32] that was to come he was a type of Christ
[1:21:35] who would sit on the Mount of Olives a
[1:21:37] rejected King and weep over
[1:21:41] Israel we can look at the different
[1:21:43] things the different uh uh sacrifices
[1:21:47] and and how they did things and that
[1:21:49] there had to be a a shedding of blood
[1:21:51] for the cover Ing and the remission of
[1:21:53] sins it was all speaking of something
[1:21:56] that was to come in the near future and
[1:21:59] the closer that the image God because
[1:22:02] understand that God didn't stay as a
[1:22:04] lugos he didn't stay as a God that we
[1:22:07] didn't understand but he became to
[1:22:09] condescend and condescend and he would
[1:22:12] reveal himself through prophets until
[1:22:15] finally it came to a time where the
[1:22:17] image and the shadow now become one and
[1:22:21] the things that the image that the
[1:22:23] shadow was portraying we could now see
[1:22:26] the image that all wound up in Jesus
[1:22:29] Christ everything of the Old Testament
[1:22:32] speaks of Christ that's why brother
[1:22:35] brandham could say Jehovah of the Old
[1:22:38] Testament is Jesus of the New
[1:22:42] Testament was speaking of things to come
[1:22:46] so it's important for us to understand
[1:22:49] when we read our Old Testament that we
[1:22:52] don't just just read it as a
[1:22:54] story we don't just read it as the life
[1:22:57] of somebody that lived no there's
[1:22:59] something that's written within there
[1:23:01] that's a type or a shadow of something
[1:23:04] that was to come and if you look closely
[1:23:07] you'll see yourself within the Old
[1:23:10] Testament whether it's with Ruth whether
[1:23:13] it's with Esther whe whoever it may be
[1:23:17] you can look closely and say that's
[1:23:21] me
[1:23:27] Hallelujah now we find out that the
[1:23:29] shadow came into a
[1:23:32] reality and the reason why it was coming
[1:23:35] into a reality was that God was wanting
[1:23:39] to make himself
[1:23:41] known but God was not just wanting to
[1:23:44] make himself known to everybody but he
[1:23:47] had a certain group in mind that he
[1:23:50] would make himself personally known ownn
[1:23:53] too the Bible says in uh John 3:16 for
[1:23:57] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:23:59] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:24:02] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:24:05] they'll have everlasting life a prophet
[1:24:07] comes along and he says that scripture
[1:24:10] is not for everyone that's right but
[1:24:13] it's only for those who have been
[1:24:15] predestinated for ordained before the
[1:24:17] foundations of the world to believe it
[1:24:20] that's that's that's you
[1:24:24] amen you know
[1:24:26] that you didn't become
[1:24:29] seed when you become reborn right that's
[1:24:33] right didn't change anything just
[1:24:36] changed your nature but you were reborn
[1:24:39] because you were already
[1:24:42] seed my goodness when you get a
[1:24:46] revelation of a new birth when you get a
[1:24:50] revelation that this guy right here is
[1:24:52] not who you
[1:24:54] are when brother brandham got the
[1:24:56] Revelation he says uh uh I I realized
[1:24:59] that I'm not the son of Charles brandham
[1:25:03] right he tried to be the son of Charles
[1:25:06] brandham he was a family of
[1:25:10] drunkards his family didn't have a a
[1:25:13] very good name amongst the people and so
[1:25:16] one day guess what he tried to do he
[1:25:17] tried to be just like his daddy come on
[1:25:19] ah give me a drink of that I'll drink it
[1:25:22] I'm a brandom I'm your son watch me
[1:25:25] drink
[1:25:28] it Bill's a he can't even drink
[1:25:32] that I'm a brandom I can smoke a
[1:25:35] cigarette I'm a brandom he tried to live
[1:25:38] his life as a brandom before he knew
[1:25:40] exactly who he was and guess what it
[1:25:42] never worked out for him right amen what
[1:25:45] about those boys that beat him up that
[1:25:47] one time he went and he got his gun
[1:25:50] loaded that thing up which one one of
[1:25:52] you boys wants to die first come
[1:25:56] on he meant it you know why because he
[1:26:00] was living as a son of Charles brandham
[1:26:03] he said Brams they're all drunkers they
[1:26:05] all died with their boots on you know
[1:26:08] what that means they're all fighters
[1:26:10] they're all drunkers they all they
[1:26:12] either they either died if somebody else
[1:26:14] killed them or whatever it was right and
[1:26:17] for a while that's who he resonated
[1:26:21] with
[1:26:22] the brandom family was who he
[1:26:27] was the brandom family was was was his
[1:26:32] identity I'm a brandom people hate me
[1:26:36] because I'm a brandom right people cross
[1:26:38] the road because they don't want to be
[1:26:40] seen walking next to her brandom they
[1:26:42] don't want to shake my hand that that's
[1:26:44] who I am that's who my family is there
[1:26:47] nobody likes
[1:26:48] me but he came to a time in his life
[1:26:52] where he realized yeah this isn't who I
[1:26:57] am thank you Lord so in other words I
[1:27:01] don't have to act like my dad amen
[1:27:05] because I have a heavenly father who
[1:27:08] teaches me the right ways to live my
[1:27:10] life I have a heavenly father who leads
[1:27:13] me and who guides me uh saint of God
[1:27:17] that's where we need to come to we need
[1:27:19] to come to a place where we stop using
[1:27:22] our family name as excuses in our lives
[1:27:25] where we stop using well this is how my
[1:27:28] dad was this is how my family was I'm a
[1:27:30] McNeely this is just who I am nonsense
[1:27:33] the blood of Jesus Christ if you will
[1:27:36] let it will cleanse us of all our family
[1:27:40] insecurities I'm like this because my
[1:27:43] family is like this no who are you
[1:27:47] anyways is that who you really are or
[1:27:49] are you a child of the king
[1:27:54] so because we are children of God now we
[1:27:58] live and act as children of God I'm
[1:28:01] reminded of the story of uh of the
[1:28:05] slave I've been thinking about that
[1:28:08] story a lot and I realized that uh you
[1:28:11] know the story he was for he was a slave
[1:28:14] he had been
[1:28:15] bought I want to and and if this if this
[1:28:18] doesn't quite match up with your way of
[1:28:20] thinking you can just spit out the the
[1:28:23] seed okay you know that they don't have
[1:28:26] seedless fruit in
[1:28:28] fonat true I learned I learned that the
[1:28:31] hard
[1:28:32] way I went to preach on it and they're
[1:28:35] all looking at me seedless fruit never
[1:28:39] heard of it had to change my subject on
[1:28:42] the
[1:28:43] [Laughter]
[1:28:47] fly but here he was this slave and and
[1:28:51] and and and you know the discussion that
[1:28:53] the master I want that guy well why did
[1:28:56] he want that guy because he was the
[1:28:58] hardest worker he held himself with
[1:29:00] dignity it didn't matter where he was in
[1:29:03] his uh geographical location he still
[1:29:06] presented himself of who he was and
[1:29:08] where he came from because it was he was
[1:29:12] representing Hallelujah he was
[1:29:15] representing his father there that was a
[1:29:18] king in a different
[1:29:19] country I wanted him now not for sale do
[1:29:22] you feed him different no I don't feed
[1:29:24] him different he's the same as everybody
[1:29:25] else uh do you clothe them different
[1:29:27] does he sleep different no no no he's
[1:29:30] he's he gets the same treatment as
[1:29:31] everybody else understand that God does
[1:29:34] not take us out of the world but he
[1:29:37] keeps us while we're in the
[1:29:40] world but I got to thinking about it and
[1:29:44] he says so this guy is having a
[1:29:46] conversation with the master with his
[1:29:49] slave master not he's not for sale he's
[1:29:51] mine
[1:29:52] why was he mine because he was bought
[1:29:54] with a
[1:29:56] price am he belongs to me amen He's Mine
[1:30:01] He's not for
[1:30:03] sale understand that that's when Satan
[1:30:05] comes and and comes before God to you
[1:30:08] and he says this guy let me have me he
[1:30:10] says no he's not for Saleen why can't I
[1:30:14] have him because he's been bought with a
[1:30:17] price you
[1:30:20] Lord you can never be lost if you're
[1:30:23] saved amen if you've been bought by the
[1:30:26] blood of Jesus
[1:30:28] Christ it doesn't matter how much you
[1:30:30] blackslide how many years you backslide
[1:30:33] you are still
[1:30:35] [Applause]
[1:30:37] godsall no he's not for sale why he's
[1:30:40] mine and I've paid a price for him and
[1:30:42] I'm not letting him go
[1:30:46] amen I liked that
[1:30:50] amen so
[1:30:53] sometimes God reveals
[1:30:56] himself and he does it in unexpected
[1:30:59] ways right at unexpected
[1:31:02] times and a lot of times for us as
[1:31:06] Believers it's a way that we don't fully
[1:31:10] understand it's a way that is against
[1:31:13] the human reasoning of our minds the
[1:31:16] unchangeable god working in an
[1:31:17] unexpectable way 1962 take a hold of
[1:31:21] God's promise say God you promised to
[1:31:24] save me he says hold on to it stay right
[1:31:27] there till you're saved God you promised
[1:31:30] to fill me with the Holy Ghost stay
[1:31:33] right there till you're filled with the
[1:31:34] Holy Ghost what is he saying he's saying
[1:31:37] don't fear off to the left or to the
[1:31:39] right but if God has made a promise just
[1:31:40] stay with the promise until it's
[1:31:42] fulfilled in our lives he says you
[1:31:45] promis to heal me I'm staying right here
[1:31:48] till you heal me there you are that's
[1:31:51] the way to to do it stay with it am it
[1:31:55] doesn't matter how long it takes stay
[1:31:58] with it that's the way to do it yes he
[1:32:02] says God is infinite he is unchangeable
[1:32:05] he cannot change and he does it in
[1:32:08] unexpected ways but hold on to hold on
[1:32:11] till it comes don't tell God
[1:32:14] [Applause]
[1:32:16] what right don't tell God
[1:32:19] what don't tell God how you want it to
[1:32:21] be
[1:32:22] performed don't tell God when you want
[1:32:24] it to be performed don't tell God how
[1:32:27] don't tell him anything just tell him
[1:32:29] I'm here and I'm willing and I'm able
[1:32:33] and I'm ready Lord to accept it
[1:32:36] am stay right there with it how you want
[1:32:39] him to do it he will do it the way you
[1:32:43] want him to do it it's not what he
[1:32:46] said he will do it the way he wants to
[1:32:51] do it
[1:32:53] am don't tell him how to do it good my
[1:32:59] so many times yes we have petitions
[1:33:03] before God and we say father this is
[1:33:06] what I would like and and I want to be
[1:33:08] saved I want my children to be saved I
[1:33:09] want this to happen I I want that to
[1:33:11] happen and so much of the time we have a
[1:33:14] preconceived idea of how it's going to
[1:33:17] happen but when we have that
[1:33:20] preconceived idea guess what happens it
[1:33:22] never happens according to your
[1:33:26] thoughts that's right so just let God be
[1:33:31] God Amen in your life yes let God be the
[1:33:35] answer to your prayer by bringing it to
[1:33:39] pass hallelujah
[1:33:42] amen these are all just little golden
[1:33:46] nuggets that can really help us in our
[1:33:48] lives aren't
[1:33:50] they
[1:33:52] so when the Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:33:55] became flesh and he dwelt in a human
[1:33:58] body a human
[1:34:00] form it was a very mysterious thing to
[1:34:04] the people of that
[1:34:06] day they didn't understand that how
[1:34:09] Jehovah God would dwell within a man
[1:34:14] they knew that God would use man and God
[1:34:17] would speak through man but they never
[1:34:19] could quite understand it God himself
[1:34:23] that great Eternal all knowing Spirit
[1:34:26] would actually dwell within the heart
[1:34:28] and the life and form of man now if they
[1:34:33] would have known this shadow of the Old
[1:34:35] Testament with Ruth and Boaz as a
[1:34:37] kinsman redeemer they would have
[1:34:39] realized that because man fell in the
[1:34:42] flesh that God would have to come in the
[1:34:45] flesh to redeem man to be his near
[1:34:48] Kinsman
[1:34:49] right but they missed the shadow yeah it
[1:34:53] was just a story that they read they
[1:34:55] missed the types how important it is for
[1:34:57] us to catch those
[1:34:59] things so we see that whenever the word
[1:35:02] of God
[1:35:03] materializes or becomes flesh it's it's
[1:35:07] a mysterious thing to the
[1:35:09] people and when it becomes flesh there's
[1:35:13] three things that I believe
[1:35:15] happens it causes a great attraction
[1:35:18] amongst the
[1:35:19] people it attracts the seed of God and
[1:35:23] it attracts the nonseed of God
[1:35:26] nevertheless it is an attraction that
[1:35:29] attracts all kinds of people remember
[1:35:32] brother brandham said that uh when the
[1:35:34] when the gospel net is cast that it
[1:35:37] catches all kinds of fish it catches all
[1:35:41] kinds of creatures all all kinds of
[1:35:43] living beings that live within the water
[1:35:47] but out of that that that that multitude
[1:35:49] of cats there might be only a few
[1:35:52] predestinated seed that's within the net
[1:35:55] we all know that so we see that when the
[1:35:58] word
[1:36:00] materializes when the word comes to pass
[1:36:02] it causes an
[1:36:05] attraction the next thing that it causes
[1:36:08] is a
[1:36:10] separation and the next thing that it
[1:36:12] brings is a
[1:36:14] persecution it attracts the
[1:36:17] people but when it attracts the people
[1:36:20] that it's supposed to attract
[1:36:22] it causes a separation within those
[1:36:25] people and when it separates the people
[1:36:27] we're going to get into this and I'll
[1:36:29] use scriptures when it C when it brings
[1:36:32] the separation the last thing it brings
[1:36:35] is a persecution Now understand we we
[1:36:39] know that the mystery of this hour is
[1:36:41] Christ in you the hope of glory so when
[1:36:45] I use these examples of an attraction a
[1:36:48] separation and a persecution and I use
[1:36:50] the example of Jesus and I use the
[1:36:53] example of brother brandom I don't want
[1:36:55] you to stop there because I'm not just
[1:36:57] talking of Jesus or brother brandom but
[1:37:00] I'm talking about your life I'm talking
[1:37:02] about who you are as a son or a daughter
[1:37:05] of God that whenever these stages come
[1:37:08] in your life there's an attraction
[1:37:10] there's a separation and a persecution
[1:37:13] you can realize wow I'm right in line
[1:37:16] with the scriptures I'm right in line
[1:37:19] with the life of brother brandom I'm
[1:37:20] right in in line with the Life of Christ
[1:37:26] amen hallelujah it's a mysterious thing
[1:37:30] so we see that when Jesus was born it
[1:37:33] caused a great
[1:37:36] attraction the wise men came and said
[1:37:38] where is he that is born King of the
[1:37:42] Jews where is he at they run through the
[1:37:44] town they were they were they had a a
[1:37:46] deep revelation of what was going on in
[1:37:49] this hour they had followed the star
[1:37:50] that they' done these different things
[1:37:53] there was an attraction that was going
[1:37:55] on what was happening the the word that
[1:37:58] was becoming flesh was now attracting
[1:38:01] the
[1:38:02] people it brought an attraction of these
[1:38:05] men to come and worship the young
[1:38:09] baby but it also attracted somebody else
[1:38:13] it attracted the king of that day as he
[1:38:16] heard the word he said my a king of the
[1:38:19] Jews isra in up well I'm the king of the
[1:38:23] Jews the attraction it attracted him but
[1:38:27] it attracted him to act and respond in a
[1:38:30] different way it didn't bring a worship
[1:38:33] to the newborn babe that was that that
[1:38:35] was there but it brought a a declaration
[1:38:39] that every child of three years and
[1:38:41] younger a male child should be slain and
[1:38:46] killed there was a great attraction but
[1:38:49] it attracted one to love life and
[1:38:51] worship and it attracted one to judgment
[1:38:55] and to
[1:38:57] death hallelujah what was
[1:39:03] it that made him do this this
[1:39:07] King it was
[1:39:10] jealousy you find out saints of God that
[1:39:14] sometimes people are going to be jealous
[1:39:15] of
[1:39:17] you and they're not going to know why
[1:39:21] but it's because they're yielding to the
[1:39:23] wrong things amen don't let jealousy
[1:39:26] amen don't let a root of jealousy come
[1:39:29] up in your heart don't be jealous of one
[1:39:33] another but rather be happy one for the
[1:39:36] other amen amen
[1:39:42] amen the same
[1:39:44] attraction it brought one to life and
[1:39:47] one to death the man you remember the
[1:39:50] scripture the man that was born blind
[1:39:53] and Jesus gave gave back his sight it it
[1:39:56] caused a a great attraction amongst the
[1:39:59] people not only to his family but to his
[1:40:02] neighbors and and you can read the
[1:40:04] scripture there in St John 9 where where
[1:40:07] where this man that was born blind and
[1:40:09] and and and Jesus gives back his sight
[1:40:11] and all of a sudden there's a great
[1:40:13] attraction amongst the people they said
[1:40:15] isn't this the man that was born blind
[1:40:18] isn't this him that that we've known for
[1:40:20] all all these years and and we know his
[1:40:22] family and and and we've been his
[1:40:24] neighbors but how is it that all of a
[1:40:26] sudden he can see how is it all of a
[1:40:29] sudden that he's not blind no more but
[1:40:32] but but but he's been given back his
[1:40:35] sight what a great attraction let's read
[1:40:37] it John 9 I'll read a few verses here 30
[1:40:40] through
[1:40:42] 33 notice how he responds to this
[1:40:44] miracle the man answered and said unto
[1:40:47] them talking to the Pharisees why herein
[1:40:50] is a marvelous thing that you that ye
[1:40:52] know not from whence he is and yet he ha
[1:40:56] opened mine eyes now we know that God
[1:40:59] heareth not Sinners but if any man be a
[1:41:02] worshipper of God and doeth His will him
[1:41:04] he heareth since the world began was not
[1:41:07] it heard that any man opened the eyes of
[1:41:10] one that was blind if this man were not
[1:41:13] of God he could do nothing
[1:41:18] amen and you find out when you read the
[1:41:21] rest of the story that Jesus because he
[1:41:24] didn't know who he was Jesus healed him
[1:41:27] opened his eyes and and then just went
[1:41:29] about his ways and then Jesus crossed
[1:41:32] path with this man because all of a
[1:41:34] sudden the Pharisees got angry they got
[1:41:37] upset they said who are you a man who
[1:41:39] was born in sin because because they
[1:41:42] said because he was blind that he was
[1:41:43] born in sin who are you to tell us and
[1:41:46] who are you to teach us of the things of
[1:41:49] God and they cast him and his family out
[1:41:51] you remember the story so Jesus crosses
[1:41:54] path with this guy and Jesus says uh uh
[1:41:57] do you believe in the Son of God he says
[1:42:00] who is he Lord that I might believe in
[1:42:03] him he says I'm the one that's talking
[1:42:04] to
[1:42:05] you the same
[1:42:08] attraction the same Miracle it brought
[1:42:11] one to
[1:42:12] life but yet the response of the other
[1:42:15] one it brought them to judgment and
[1:42:18] death why because they were looking at
[1:42:22] the wrong thing amen Pharisees were
[1:42:25] looking through eyes of
[1:42:28] jealousy why was it that they could
[1:42:30] never support
[1:42:31] him why was it that they could never get
[1:42:34] behind Jesus because he was taken away
[1:42:37] from their their Glory he was doing
[1:42:40] things he was speaking with authority he
[1:42:43] was speaking with an authority that the
[1:42:45] scribes did not have and the people were
[1:42:48] noticing it
[1:42:52] so the one thing that they could do hey
[1:42:53] we got to get rid of this man let's get
[1:42:56] him out of here why because he's taken
[1:42:58] away from us they were
[1:43:01] jealous how easy it is for
[1:43:03] ministers they get jealous one of
[1:43:06] another
[1:43:08] amen get a minister to preach a real
[1:43:11] good sermon all of a sudden the other
[1:43:13] ministers are all jealous well I don't
[1:43:15] know yeah he said this but he should
[1:43:18] have said that no
[1:43:21] come on get behind him support him say
[1:43:25] Well done God bless you I humbled myself
[1:43:28] to Brother Steve clar at the wedding
[1:43:30] reception here the other day I said
[1:43:32] brother Steve phenomenal service
[1:43:34] Wednesday night very very very good
[1:43:36] whole service man he's stepping all over
[1:43:38] my
[1:43:41] toes I said brother Steve and I fought
[1:43:44] with it I'll be honest I said brother
[1:43:47] Steve remember you said that someone was
[1:43:50] praying and it changed your uh uh
[1:43:53] changed your sermon and what you were
[1:43:55] going to speak on he said yeah I said
[1:43:57] well perhaps I wasn't praying
[1:44:00] enough and God changed your sermon title
[1:44:03] to speak directly to
[1:44:05] me I receive it
[1:44:08] amen God help
[1:44:11] us how easy it is to get caught up with
[1:44:14] life how easy it is to get off to the
[1:44:17] left or off to the right I say father
[1:44:19] keep us in this straight and narrow
[1:44:21] and when you correct us with the hand of
[1:44:24] love a love of Correction Lord let me
[1:44:27] receive
[1:44:28] it I receive it
[1:44:32] Lord we notice that these the Pharisees
[1:44:36] and the man that was born blind they
[1:44:38] both saw the same attraction sure but
[1:44:41] they had a different
[1:44:45] reaction the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:44:47] caused a great
[1:44:49] attraction John 12:9 and 10 and much
[1:44:53] people of the Jews therefore knew that
[1:44:55] he was there speaking of Lazarus and
[1:44:58] they came not for jesus' sake only but
[1:45:01] that they might see Lazarus also whom he
[1:45:05] had raised from the dead wow what a
[1:45:07] great attraction this miracle was it
[1:45:10] wasn't just an attraction for the family
[1:45:12] but all of the people who were
[1:45:14] roundabout and involved and knew of his
[1:45:16] death hey guess what they wanted to see
[1:45:18] this man that was dead for 4 days and
[1:45:21] now was alive
[1:45:23] again notice the reaction of the
[1:45:26] Pharisees but the chief priests
[1:45:28] consulted that they might put Lazarus
[1:45:30] also to death they're trying to squish
[1:45:34] his ministry I want you to be thinking
[1:45:37] now remember of Jesus of brother
[1:45:40] brandham and
[1:45:42] yourself put yourself in the
[1:45:45] situation they saw the same
[1:45:48] attraction but it brought a different
[1:45:53] reaction the Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:45:56] they say the the they saw the same
[1:45:58] things that that they were attracted
[1:46:01] to but they saw something different than
[1:46:04] the woman at the wh when the woman at
[1:46:06] the well had her heart discerned what
[1:46:09] happened she said uh I know that when
[1:46:12] the Messiah cometh he's going to tell us
[1:46:15] these he's going to do these things and
[1:46:16] tell us these things and he said I am he
[1:46:19] who speaks to thee
[1:46:21] oh my she dropped her water pot she
[1:46:23] dropped all her things she run into the
[1:46:25] town and she said come and see a man
[1:46:27] he's shown me and he's told me all
[1:46:29] things isn't this the Christ and because
[1:46:32] of her
[1:46:33] testimony right yes an unclean
[1:46:37] woman who had many
[1:46:39] husbands and the one that she was living
[1:46:42] with wasn't even her
[1:46:45] husband a woman that couldn't fetch
[1:46:47] water at the same time as the rest of
[1:46:49] the women come on when she met
[1:46:53] Jesus understand things
[1:46:56] changed
[1:46:58] it when she met with her true husband
[1:47:01] amen guess what happened her testimony
[1:47:04] changed yes her life
[1:47:07] changed and she wasn't seen anymore as
[1:47:10] that woman that's
[1:47:13] right
[1:47:16] Hallelujah when God meets with a sinner
[1:47:19] onen how dare we look at that person as
[1:47:23] a sinner because we were all born in sin
[1:47:26] and shaped in iniquity amen and so when
[1:47:28] God does something in someone's life we
[1:47:31] need to look at them now as a son or a
[1:47:34] daughter of God and listen to their
[1:47:38] testimony because things change when
[1:47:40] people meet
[1:47:44] Jesus
[1:47:46] Hallelujah she said this is the Messiah
[1:47:49] but when he did the same things with the
[1:47:52] with the Sadducees and Pharisees they
[1:47:54] said this is Bey Bob he's a he he casts
[1:47:59] out Devils by the spirit of the
[1:48:02] devil same
[1:48:04] attraction different
[1:48:08] reaction the Bible talks about how many
[1:48:11] multitudes would follow Jesus and they
[1:48:14] would throng him and they would want to
[1:48:16] touch him because virtue would go out of
[1:48:18] him and and he would feed the 5,000 and
[1:48:20] feed the 7,000 and and do this miracle
[1:48:23] and do that miracle and it was a great
[1:48:25] great attraction that was bringing the
[1:48:27] people towards him of both seed and
[1:48:29] nonseed but with the same attractions
[1:48:32] there was different reactions amongst
[1:48:34] the people that's
[1:48:38] right begs the question we need to ask
[1:48:41] is why were they following him then why
[1:48:44] were there multitudes that was following
[1:48:47] him I believe that some were were
[1:48:50] following him for their own
[1:48:53] gain something that they could get from
[1:48:55] him something that they needed prayed
[1:48:58] for something they needed a touch they
[1:49:00] they needed their lives changed it was
[1:49:02] it was a personal gain it it wasn't
[1:49:05] because they had a revelation of of who
[1:49:07] he was it wasn't because they had a
[1:49:10] revelation that God was fulfilling his
[1:49:12] word that this was Emanuel born in flesh
[1:49:16] dwelling amongst us
[1:49:18] no they had different reasons
[1:49:21] some it was for because they wanted what
[1:49:24] he had to
[1:49:26] offer for some it was the big thing that
[1:49:30] was trending in Jerusalem in that day
[1:49:32] notice everybody's you ever notice
[1:49:34] people they change their ideas on things
[1:49:37] and they decorate their house and they
[1:49:38] do this and they do that and this is
[1:49:41] cool today and but it's not cool
[1:49:42] tomorrow because they're caught up with
[1:49:44] what's trending huh what's trending
[1:49:47] today I want to be trendy I want to be
[1:49:49] cool
[1:49:50] so they're always changing how they look
[1:49:52] and how they do things that's how it was
[1:49:54] with them in that day because multitudes
[1:49:57] will gather
[1:49:58] multitudes you'll find that there will
[1:50:00] be people come to church they'll see all
[1:50:02] the cars outside and they'll think my
[1:50:05] it's a big church it must be wonderful
[1:50:08] it must be good and and they're
[1:50:09] attracted to it because of the numbers
[1:50:12] but when they come if all you're looking
[1:50:14] for is numbers you're looking for the
[1:50:16] wrong thing because when the word brings
[1:50:19] a correction in our lives guess what
[1:50:20] you're going to beat it out there real
[1:50:22] early why because you're coming for the
[1:50:24] wrong reason but when we come to church
[1:50:27] not because of the numbers but because
[1:50:30] you want God to speak to your heart
[1:50:32] through the ministering of the word it
[1:50:33] doesn't matter if there's a correction
[1:50:35] that comes or not you're going to stay
[1:50:36] there because the word is what you're
[1:50:41] wanting praise the
[1:50:43] Lord and we find that there was some
[1:50:46] there that were following his ministry
[1:50:49] and the attraction
[1:50:51] not because they understood
[1:50:54] everything that's right not because they
[1:50:56] knew exactly who who he was not because
[1:50:59] they knew exactly his ministry and they
[1:51:01] were able to explain it and everything
[1:51:04] but they knew that God was doing
[1:51:07] something in their midst and I believe
[1:51:10] hey I can put myself there I remember
[1:51:14] when I first heard of the message
[1:51:15] serpent
[1:51:17] seed and I got the little uh uh you
[1:51:20] remember the little pamphlet original
[1:51:22] sin and I got that thing and uh and I I
[1:51:26] pretty much my first Bible first message
[1:51:28] study I ever did first came to the Lord
[1:51:31] and I and uh I said well I'm going to
[1:51:34] let my mom and dad have it see what they
[1:51:36] say about this get that thing and cuz I
[1:51:39] would invite them to church they
[1:51:40] wouldn't
[1:51:41] come and I would invite them and I would
[1:51:44] invite them and they wouldn't come then
[1:51:45] finally my mom came and she'd go uh I
[1:51:47] said well how was the service mom oh it
[1:51:50] was nice son yeah the music was real
[1:51:52] nice the singing was nice and the
[1:51:54] singing was not nice you get a bunch of
[1:51:56] European men trying to sing How Great Is
[1:51:58] Our God it
[1:52:00] just those of you that have visited
[1:52:02] European churches you understand it's
[1:52:05] nice but it's not that
[1:52:12] nice and so finally I had enough I said
[1:52:16] you know what I want to let them have it
[1:52:18] and I got that thing A4 piece of paper
[1:52:20] and I wrote that thing out and I said
[1:52:22] I'm going to let them see this and see
[1:52:23] what they think of this serpent seed how
[1:52:25] about that get it and I give it to my
[1:52:28] mom to read first cuz my mom is a better
[1:52:30] reader than my dad you know I I kind of
[1:52:32] take after my dad a little bit and so my
[1:52:35] mom reads it she goes yeah okay well I
[1:52:38] guess that makes sense son and give it
[1:52:40] to my dad you know 20 minutes later he's
[1:52:43] he has it red yeah yeah makes complete
[1:52:46] sense here I am wanting an argument with
[1:52:49] my family
[1:52:51] huh it didn't happen well guess what
[1:52:54] when you're seed you can't help but see
[1:52:59] it we don't understand it all when we
[1:53:01] first came to Christ when we first heard
[1:53:03] about this message and guess what we
[1:53:05] don't understand it all right now but I
[1:53:08] can say from the bottom of my heart I
[1:53:10] believe it with all my heart and I love
[1:53:13] the Lord with all my heart and I am
[1:53:15] convinced that this message is the
[1:53:18] truth whether I can explain it or
[1:53:21] understand it all or not has nothing to
[1:53:22] do with
[1:53:24] it the
[1:53:27] Lord we find that they all had different
[1:53:29] motives and objectives for being
[1:53:31] attracted to the ministry but only the
[1:53:34] bride of Christ will stay with the word
[1:53:38] because the bride of Christ is the only
[1:53:40] one that can bring the word into full
[1:53:43] manifestation
[1:53:47] amen we see that brother bram's Ministry
[1:53:49] it began just like Jesus's Ministry
[1:53:52] first and second pull hey great
[1:53:55] multitudes followed his ministry he
[1:53:58] would get to invite he would be invited
[1:54:00] to preach over here and over there and
[1:54:02] he was a great man of God as as long as
[1:54:04] he was having prayer lines and as long
[1:54:06] as he was Discerning the hearts of the
[1:54:08] people and everybody loved him there was
[1:54:10] a great attraction that was that was
[1:54:12] following his ministry but understand in
[1:54:15] that great attraction it was attracting
[1:54:18] seed and it was attracting
[1:54:21] nonseed it was attracting those that
[1:54:23] were that were following his ministry
[1:54:25] for their own gain there was those that
[1:54:29] were following his ministry because he
[1:54:31] had a great name and they wanted to be
[1:54:33] associated with that
[1:54:35] name and then there was ones following
[1:54:37] his ministry just because it was the
[1:54:38] trendy thing to do in the 40s
[1:54:42] 50s is to go to all the healing revivals
[1:54:45] and see what God was going to
[1:54:48] do someone go to go to those
[1:54:52] revivals something in their hearts I'm
[1:54:55] gonna prove it wrong I'm going to catch
[1:54:58] him I'm going to see brother brandom
[1:55:01] says in a certain place he says when the
[1:55:03] angel of the Lord
[1:55:05] speaks it can not happen amen why
[1:55:09] because it's God says a man's word will
[1:55:11] fail but his words will never fail
[1:55:15] praise the
[1:55:18] Lord
[1:55:20] we find that many were following him for
[1:55:23] different
[1:55:24] reasons but God doesn't care about those
[1:55:28] who are following for uh motives and
[1:55:31] objectives that aren't quite
[1:55:33] correct God doesn't care about those
[1:55:36] that are following because it's the
[1:55:38] trendy thing to do the only thing that
[1:55:40] God cares about is attracting that
[1:55:43] rainbow trout the only thing that God
[1:55:46] cares about is attracting the seed of
[1:55:49] God to to what he's doing in that hour
[1:55:51] amen because remember when the gospel
[1:55:53] net is cast it catches all kinds of
[1:55:59] fish hallelujah
[1:56:04] amen so we see then that there was a
[1:56:08] great attraction in his ministry put
[1:56:09] yourself now let me just talk about you
[1:56:12] for a few seconds what about you you
[1:56:16] attract many people in your life do you
[1:56:17] know that by the way that you live and
[1:56:20] act and speak the way you present
[1:56:23] yourself guess what it's an attraction
[1:56:25] to the people of Luda amen but it's
[1:56:28] going to attract all kinds of people and
[1:56:32] all kinds of people are going to be
[1:56:34] attracted for different
[1:56:36] reasons some are going to be attracted
[1:56:39] because of what you have to offer some
[1:56:41] are going to be attracted because you
[1:56:43] have some kind of good personality that
[1:56:46] they like being around and you know what
[1:56:48] when you stop offering offering out what
[1:56:50] they want chances are you won't be an
[1:56:53] attraction in their lives anymore but
[1:56:55] don't let that stop you from
[1:56:57] fishing don't let that stop you from
[1:57:00] being salty and attracting people to
[1:57:03] your lives because at some point you
[1:57:06] will attract the right kind of person
[1:57:09] you will attract a person that'll come
[1:57:12] to church and be caught by the
[1:57:16] word keep fishing my brother and my
[1:57:19] sister sister you know you young girls
[1:57:21] that you can go
[1:57:23] fishing you know that you can be
[1:57:26] salty you know that you don't have to
[1:57:28] preach a sermon in order to be an
[1:57:31] attraction for somebody to come and hear
[1:57:33] the
[1:57:34] word come on no all you got to do is be
[1:57:38] yourself cuz we're already so different
[1:57:42] than the people of louia that they'll be
[1:57:45] attracted to say
[1:57:46] hey something different about you amen
[1:57:49] what is it that you
[1:57:51] believe and if somebody comes and they
[1:57:54] hear the word and they're offended and
[1:57:56] they leave guess what it's not your
[1:57:57] fault that's right what is it you are an
[1:58:02] attraction but the word brought a
[1:58:05] separation good so let's get into the
[1:58:09] separation
[1:58:11] now I know you're all tired but I got
[1:58:13] started late okay I didn't come to the
[1:58:16] pulpit till
[1:58:18] 11:00
[1:58:20] stay with
[1:58:24] me so now the word when it is made flesh
[1:58:27] or manifested it also produces a
[1:58:31] separation when Jesus began to preach to
[1:58:34] them the Beatitudes and things what was
[1:58:36] he doing he was separating them from the
[1:58:39] Flesh and from sin he's saying yeah your
[1:58:41] law says this but I'm going to tell you
[1:58:44] this and and this is he was giving to
[1:58:46] them a higher standard in how to live
[1:58:49] their life not a standard of law but it
[1:58:52] was now turning to a standard of Grace
[1:58:55] so he was because there was an
[1:58:58] attraction came Now understand when the
[1:59:01] attraction came it attracted everybody
[1:59:03] can we agree with that but when the word
[1:59:06] began to be preached the attraction now
[1:59:08] was causing a separation but it wasn't
[1:59:12] separating everybody all at once from
[1:59:15] the attraction because people still held
[1:59:17] on to the attraction
[1:59:20] amen understand that God wants you and I
[1:59:23] to be separated from the things of this
[1:59:25] world and there's one thing that's going
[1:59:27] to separate us and that's the word of
[1:59:29] God so he began to preach the Beatitudes
[1:59:33] and these different things and we
[1:59:35] realized that he came to a place in his
[1:59:37] ministry hey he had he had a bunch of
[1:59:40] people following him he had 70 that he
[1:59:43] had already sent out and they were doing
[1:59:45] different Miracles and casting out
[1:59:47] devils and they were making a way for
[1:59:48] him to come into that City but he
[1:59:51] realized that the attraction was still
[1:59:54] very strong they were still attracted by
[1:59:57] The Miracles and the signs of his life
[2:00:00] and so now he comes to a place in his
[2:00:02] life and he says unless you drink the
[2:00:04] blood and hate the Flesh of the son of
[2:00:06] man you have no part in
[2:00:09] me he dropped the mic and he walked off
[2:00:11] the
[2:00:13] platform mic
[2:00:15] dropped right everybody was bewilder
[2:00:20] this is a hard
[2:00:21] saying how can we how can we do this how
[2:00:24] can we drink his blood how can we eat
[2:00:26] his flesh the Bible says that many more
[2:00:28] follow many followed with him no more
[2:00:32] right so no doubt the disciples they
[2:00:34] were shooken
[2:00:36] shaking wow this great ministry seems
[2:00:39] like it's falling apart what's going on
[2:00:42] listen God said so God had a plan he
[2:00:47] says are you going to go also are you
[2:00:49] offended in this are you offended in
[2:00:52] this word or you are you offended by the
[2:00:54] revealed word of the hour are you scared
[2:00:56] to say that you believe that God sent a
[2:00:58] prophet are you scared to say that you
[2:01:01] believe the Seven Seals have been been
[2:01:03] ripped off this book that your Bible has
[2:01:05] become a new book saints of God I am not
[2:01:08] ashamed of this gospel I am not ashamed
[2:01:11] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ or the
[2:01:14] work that God has done in this hour
[2:01:17] don't be scared to sh share
[2:01:20] it amen even though you have a great
[2:01:23] attraction in your life of people give
[2:01:26] them the word test Hallelujah that's
[2:01:28] what brother brandom said give them the
[2:01:30] word test and you'll find out whether
[2:01:33] they're attracted to you for the right
[2:01:34] reasons or
[2:01:36] not amen so true why did those 12 walk
[2:01:41] away because their motives and their
[2:01:44] objectives were
[2:01:46] wrong but there was 12 that were there
[2:01:49] with him they didn't understand at
[2:01:53] all perhaps they couldn't explain what
[2:01:55] he had just
[2:01:57] said and Peter said Lord where can we
[2:02:02] go and I say this morning Lord where are
[2:02:05] we going to
[2:02:06] go am I going to go back to denomination
[2:02:09] are we going to go back into the world
[2:02:11] it doesn't solve
[2:02:13] anything it just makes your life a
[2:02:17] misery
[2:02:20] you know sometimes the world will will
[2:02:24] give you
[2:02:25] a uh uh what's it
[2:02:28] called uh momentary
[2:02:33] satisfaction you know why because it's
[2:02:35] satisfying your flesh right that's right
[2:02:39] all this feels good little bit of sin
[2:02:43] feels good to get out and let my hair
[2:02:45] down feels good to get out here with the
[2:02:48] boys and
[2:02:49] and do whatever I want yeah it's cool
[2:02:52] I'm cool at school cool at work
[2:02:55] momentary
[2:02:56] satisfaction many of you guys want to
[2:02:58] give a momentary satisfaction to sin and
[2:03:01] ruin your
[2:03:04] testimony hardest thing to ever do is to
[2:03:06] come back oh yeah because if you're a
[2:03:09] seat of God guess what you will come
[2:03:12] back amen it's just a fact God just sets
[2:03:16] the drag oh there he goes again he's
[2:03:19] running again yeah okay enough is enough
[2:03:23] I'm bringing you
[2:03:27] in momentary
[2:03:30] satisfaction how many of you want a
[2:03:32] little piece of the world for momentary
[2:03:35] satisfaction think about it because it
[2:03:37] never satisfies the
[2:03:40] soul it never satisfies the seed that
[2:03:43] lays within you so let me just tell you
[2:03:47] all momentary satisfaction
[2:03:51] disappears that's right but when you
[2:03:53] serve God with all your
[2:03:55] heart whether you have mistakes or not
[2:03:58] guess what you are
[2:04:00] satisfied right amen because that's who
[2:04:03] you really
[2:04:04] are that's
[2:04:07] good I wonder who the next person is
[2:04:09] going to be I feel like stand with it
[2:04:13] 2024 you say I've had
[2:04:16] enough just for the moment I want to let
[2:04:19] my hair down and find out who I
[2:04:24] am I want to find out what it's
[2:04:28] like to live outside a
[2:04:31] church let me tell you something that's
[2:04:33] disgusting amen it's evil it's nasty and
[2:04:38] sin will hold you longer than you ever
[2:04:41] thought
[2:04:43] possible all because you weren't
[2:04:45] yielding to the things of God when you
[2:04:47] were in church my brother and my
[2:04:51] sister don't ruin your
[2:04:54] testimony for a momentary satisfaction
[2:04:57] yes help
[2:04:59] us
[2:05:02] hallelujah because it's but for a moment
[2:05:05] amen it fades
[2:05:08] away those people that were attracted to
[2:05:12] you hey guess what they'll leave you yes
[2:05:17] they can care less
[2:05:19] you think people in church don't care
[2:05:21] try having friends of the
[2:05:28] world ah

[2:05:34] been there

[2:05:41] place then where do you go right where
[2:05:45] do you go from that
