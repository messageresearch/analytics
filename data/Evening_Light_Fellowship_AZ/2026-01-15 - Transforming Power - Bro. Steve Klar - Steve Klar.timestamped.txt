[13:36] Amen. Just give him a praise offering
[13:37] this evening. Amen. So thankful for that
[13:41] blood this evening. Amen. Before we
[13:46] we'll read our needs now, then we'll
[13:47] we'll sing uh you're the glory and the
[13:49] lifter of my head. We only had one, but
[13:52] we've got a couple more here. Brother
[13:54] Ron has a special and spoken prayer
[13:56] request. And then also, brother Kelly,
[13:59] Kelly McMillan needs an encouraging
[14:01] touch and healing virtue. So, let's
[14:04] remember both of those. And then our
[14:06] brother David Rutled is in a rehabil
[14:08] rehabilitation center and is being well
[14:10] taken care of, but because of his mild
[14:12] stroke, he has a speech therapist coming
[14:15] four times a week. He also broke both
[14:17] his collar bones and he's in a lot of
[14:18] pain. So, let's just keep our brother
[14:20] David in prayer as well. Amen. and our
[14:22] our sister Debia Cell has been moved to
[14:25] the Phoenix Mountain Post Acute Care. Um
[14:28] she would love to be some visitors come.
[14:30] She'll be there for about four to five
[14:32] weeks and there's a bulletin board with
[14:34] the address and phone number for how to
[14:35] get there. So let's just continue to
[14:37] remember her and the visitors. We have a
[14:41] a sign up over there. Amen. Before we go
[14:44] to the Lord with these needs, let's sing
[14:46] you're the glory and the lifter of my
[14:47] head. If you have a need, didn't get a
[14:48] chance to turn it in, just give it to
[14:50] the Lord right now. Amen.
[14:53] You're my glory
[14:58] and the lift
[15:00] of my head.
[15:07] You're my glory
[15:12] and the lifter
[15:14] of my hand.
[15:21] Oh,
[15:23] thou,
[15:26] oh Lord,
[15:29] are a shield
[15:32] for me,
[15:36] my glory
[15:40] and the lifter
[15:42] of my hand.
[15:46] Amen. and our brother Johnny Green if
[15:48] you could come open our service. In
[15:50] order of prayer as he's coming, we do
[15:51] have two praise reports. Our sister
[15:53] Julie Frank was released from the
[15:54] hospital today. So, she's home resting.
[15:57] And our sister Perfect Noah has turned
[15:58] in a note. God bless you saints. I want
[16:00] to take a moment to thank the church for
[16:02] your prayers. Some time ago, I brought a
[16:04] request on behalf of a dear friend who
[16:06] is going through a very difficult
[16:07] season. She experienced two miscarriages
[16:09] and later gave birth to a stillborn
[16:11] baby. Was very heavy time and very
[16:13] overwhelming. But God is faithful. He
[16:15] heard the prayers of the saints and on
[16:17] January 2nd, 2026, he blessed her with a
[16:19] healthy baby girl. Thank you, church,
[16:21] for standing with her in prayer. So, we
[16:23] just thank the Lord for those two prayer
[16:24] requests. Brother John, if you could
[16:26] pray over our needs.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Rafa.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Gracious Lord Jesus, what an honor it is
[16:35] to come in your presence, Lord. We ask
[16:37] you, Lord, if there be any impediment in
[16:39] our life, anything you've seen that's
[16:41] none like you, Lord, please remove it
[16:42] out of the way. We just want to just
[16:45] come into your house with praise and
[16:47] thanksgiving in our heart. We want you,
[16:49] Father God, to come and bless us with
[16:51] your presence. Bless our brother Steve
[16:54] as he brings the word. And Lord, these
[16:56] prayer requests and needs. Lord, you
[16:58] know, every single one of them. There's
[17:00] so many more that we didn't even write
[17:01] down, but they're in our hearts. Lord,
[17:04] would you be with each one we pray,
[17:05] Father? May our faith increase, Lord, as
[17:08] we go from day to day. Lord, there's
[17:11] nothing in this world that's worth
[17:12] living for. You've given us, Lord Jesus,
[17:15] by your amazing grace, something to live
[17:17] for. Father, you said, "Where I am, you
[17:20] shall be also." And we're longing for
[17:22] that day to be with you. So Lord, thank
[17:25] you once again for meeting these needs
[17:28] and coming in amongst us. We pray in
[17:30] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Why don't you greet your neighbor as
[17:35] you're taking your seat this evening?
[17:37] Amen. The brothers in the back wanted me
[17:40] to announce just so you all remember our
[17:41] anniversary meetings. That'll be April
[17:43] 3rd, fourth, and fifth. We've got our
[17:45] brother Brian Naidu and our brother Ed
[17:46] Hammeister. So, just keep those dates on
[17:50] your calendar. Amen. Let's go ahead and
[17:53] key if that same spirit Amen. I need
[17:57] more of that spirit. I don't know about
[17:58] you this evening. Amen. If that same
[18:02] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[18:05] dwells in you,
[18:08] dwell in you.
[18:11] If that same spirit that raised Christ
[18:15] from the dead dwell in you,

[18:47] dead dwells in you,

[18:57] from the dead dwells in me
[19:01] with me, this is what it'll do. It will
[19:04] quicken
[19:06] my body
[19:09] cuz that's

[31:41] Heavenly Father, we have our hands
[31:45] &gt;&gt; raised into the air speaking and singing
[31:48] those words. We believe, Lord.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; The gates of hell cannot prevail.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, because your word is ever true.
[31:58] It's yay and it's amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Father, we see written in the scripture
[32:03] that you are alpha and omega. You are
[32:06] the beginning and the end. You are the
[32:08] provider of all.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray that we would be like
[32:12] that little woman that would press in
[32:14] and touch
[32:15] &gt;&gt; the hem of your garment.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Whatever we have need of tonight, Lord,
[32:21] you can meet every single one of our
[32:24] needs.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Your word has expressed it to us, Lord.
[32:28] And we say, I believe. I believe, Lord.
[32:32] Lord,
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, there are some that are sick
[32:35] amongst us. The doctor's reports are
[32:39] negative, but Father, we look to your
[32:41] word and we see that your report is
[32:45] true. You are the healer, Lord. By your
[32:48] stripes, we are healed.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that our faith would
[32:54] arise even now in the building
[32:56] &gt;&gt; to receive exactly what we have need of.
[33:00] Lord, there's prayer, there's faith uh
[33:02] praise reports before us. And many have
[33:05] said, God has touched us. And Lord, if
[33:07] you can do it for one, you can do it for
[33:09] another.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; So we believe it with all of our heart.
[33:13] And may our hearts not be troubled,
[33:15] neither shall we be afraid.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; But Lord, may we enter into your gates
[33:19] with gladness knowing that you have
[33:22] already provided.
[33:25] I pray Lord that you would now take the
[33:28] word of God and share it to the people.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm looking for you to come. Lord,
[33:34] I'm not looking for a man to do any any
[33:37] work here this evening. I pray, oh God,
[33:39] that you would use my lips, my my
[33:42] vessel, Lord, for the honor and glory of
[33:45] your word. And may the people receive
[33:47] every thing that they have need of
[33:49] whatever they've come for. May they
[33:51] receive it now in the name of Jesus
[33:54] Christ we pray.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Father, may you clear my mind and loose
[33:58] my tongue that I might speak. Lord,
[34:01] &gt;&gt; may I not bring a hindrance, Lord, but
[34:03] may I bring an encouragement. We pray
[34:06] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[34:11] &gt;&gt; amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's good
[34:14] to be in the house of the Lord with you

[34:18] the Lord. And I I want to thank you all
[34:21] for coming this evening. Amen. And I I

[34:58] our Bibles, would you? To Romans chap
[35:02] 12. Romans chapter 12 and we're going to
[35:05] read verse 1 and two.
[35:09] Romans chapter 12 and then we'll let you

[35:25] father would sit us around on morning
[35:27] devotions and uh well he would he would
[35:31] have us memorize scripture. And I think
[35:33] that's good. How many knows that it's
[35:35] good to memorize scripture? Well, you
[35:37] know, we didn't know that at uh at our
[35:39] childhood the Lord would use us for the
[35:41] ministry, but this is one of my favorite
[35:43] scriptures, and I thought I'd share it
[35:44] with you this evening.

[35:51] I beseech you therefore, brethren,
[35:54] by the mercies of God,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; that ye present your bodies a living
[36:01] sacrifice.
[36:03] Holy and acceptable unto God, which is
[36:05] your reasonable. Can you say that we
[36:08] with me? Reasonable service. I want you
[36:12] to see here that God is not asking us to
[36:14] do anything unreasonable.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; And be not conformed to this world,
[36:21] &gt;&gt; but be ye transformed
[36:25] &gt;&gt; by the renewing of your mind,
[36:28] &gt;&gt; that ye may prove
[36:31] what is that is good and acceptable and
[36:34] a perfect will of God.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. You may be
[36:40] seated.
[36:42] Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles then
[36:44] right away to 2 Corinthians chapter 3
[36:47] verse 18.
[36:53] But we all with open face
[36:56] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[36:59] Lord
[37:01] are changed into the same image from
[37:04] glory to glory
[37:06] even by the spirit of the Lord. Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; We are changed into his image, into his
[37:14] likeness by his spirit.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Then if you could go over to Philippians
[37:20] chapter 14, Paul the Apostle speaking to
[37:23] the Philippians who he loved dearly and
[37:26] he says these words, "Brethren,
[37:29] I count not myself to have apprehended."
[37:32] what he's saying that you know I I don't
[37:34] have it all there together but this one
[37:37] thing I want to TELL YOU
[37:39] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS ONE THING I do
[37:42] &gt;&gt; forgetting those things which are behind
[37:46] &gt;&gt; and reaching forth unto those things
[37:50] which are before
[37:53] &gt;&gt; we don't always want to just look behind
[37:54] us
[37:56] &gt;&gt; we our testimony is not about just
[37:58] what's behind us
[38:00] &gt;&gt; but we want to look forward Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; We want to see what God is doing
[38:04] presently and we want to see what God is
[38:06] going to do for us
[38:08] &gt;&gt; in the future.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Then verse 14, I like this so much. HE
[38:13] SAYS, "I PRESS towards the mark."
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; It's not just a slow meander. It's a
[38:20] pressing.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; And we'll SPEAK THIS EVENING. WE WANT TO
[38:23] PRESS as transformed people. Yes sir.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; My title of my message this is what one
[38:28] day we were once deformed brother Robert
[38:31] but now we have been transformed
[38:34] &gt;&gt; by the renewing of our minds and we're
[38:37] pressing forth towards the mark of the
[38:40] high calling
[38:41] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; I'd like to read you a quotation just
[38:46] before so you catch my thoughts. And as
[38:50] I was studying for this Wednesday
[38:52] meeting, brother had asked if I would
[38:54] speak and I and I took some time. I I
[38:56] really pressed in and I asked Lord, what
[38:58] would you like for the Wednesday
[38:59] evening? I and I believe nothing is by
[39:01] chance.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; I I I know that God is w wanting
[39:06] desiring to witness to our hearts to in
[39:08] encourage us this evening. And and
[39:11] brother Brandon would say in this
[39:12] message witnesses in 1956
[39:15] he would says I'm happy tonight that
[39:17] there's people here who can witness the
[39:21] same thing. I once was lost.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Think about it. We were all there.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; I ONCE WAS LOST BUT NOW I'M FOUND.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; We were ALL IN A PAWN SHOP ONE DAY.
[39:36] There was one that came by and took us
[39:38] out of that pawn shop.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M FOUND. I
[39:44] WAS DEAD, BUT NOW I'M ALIVE.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say, "We are
[39:49] quickened. We are made alive." Amen.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; A witness of those resurrecting power
[39:56] that came that can take a vile sinner
[40:00] and can transform their whole being and
[40:04] take their their emotions and their
[40:06] ideas
[40:08] and their thoughts. I say, Lord, take my
[40:11] thoughts and take their thoughts and
[40:14] change them into an eternal hope.
[40:18] This evening, I want us to see that
[40:20] we're an eternal people.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; FOR INSIDE OF our very being is the
[40:26] eternal God
[40:28] &gt;&gt; and eternal life that's with inside of
[40:30] us.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; And so, as you can see in our scripture
[40:33] reading that I like to speak these on
[40:36] these words, transformed.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Now, that word transformed, it it means
[40:42] to be changed. It means to be made
[40:45] different.
[40:46] It literally means that your character
[40:49] itself has been changed. And not only
[40:53] changed, it has been put into service.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; What good would it be if we were only a
[40:59] people that were changed? But we want to
[41:01] be those that are in service for Jesus
[41:04] Christ.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would teach us and
[41:07] explain to us in the message of the
[41:09] countdown. He would say, "You have been
[41:11] born again. You have received the new
[41:13] birth." And then THE HOLY GHOST, THE
[41:16] POWER comes into that birth for service.
[41:21] So we are here today and I believe that
[41:23] most of us here in the building have had
[41:25] an experience with God. I believe that
[41:28] we are mature believers. But I I do
[41:30] believe that God wants us to remind
[41:33] oursel of of what he's done for us in
[41:35] our lives. and those THAT MAYBE HAVE NOT
[41:38] BEEN CHANGED HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED THAT
[41:41] GOD would move in their beings that they
[41:43] would collectively come to the presence
[41:45] of God and be changed.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that God is a
[41:49] transforming changing?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, we desire change inside of our
[41:55] lives.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; NOW, WHEN GOD CHANGES OUR CHARACTER,
[41:58] when he when he molds us, when he when
[42:00] he makes us, HE HE'S NOT JUST polishing
[42:03] us up.
[42:05] He's not just patching us up. NO, HE'S
[42:09] NOT JUST MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS. But I
[42:11] I believe with all of my heart that he
[42:14] is complete, it's a complete work. He's
[42:17] completely and divinely changing us for
[42:21] his service.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; If I could just for a moment, if I could
[42:25] just emphasize that for you just a
[42:27] moment. There is only one power that can
[42:31] truly transform us and that is the power
[42:36] by the word of God
[42:38] &gt;&gt; and that is by the Holy Ghost. That's by
[42:40] God's very own life.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Now man can educate.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Men would like us to take the scripture
[42:49] and compare scripture with scripture and
[42:52] we can take quotations and we can
[42:54] memorize those as well. And many times
[42:57] we would get together around the coffee
[42:59] table. Each one of us would give a
[43:01] thought or we would we would share
[43:03] something that we have maybe memorized
[43:05] but and or maybe educated ourselves
[43:07] into. But God God's work, God's
[43:10] changing, God's transforming power is
[43:12] not an education.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Many times I think the believer comes to
[43:17] a place of education. I think many times
[43:20] that we figure if we could just memorize
[43:22] or we could just grasp the just just by
[43:25] education some of the good gospel truths
[43:27] that God would accept us. But no friend,
[43:30] God wants to mold us, to change us, make
[43:33] us a new
[43:36] &gt;&gt; society, church community can regulate
[43:39] you.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; I I've seen it most of my Christian
[43:42] life. Many times people come and they
[43:44] they'll come to church for years,
[43:46] brother Dom. that they'll come to church
[43:48] and sit in a under a good ministry.
[43:50] They'll they'll come and and they'll
[43:52] they'll do the dos and don'ts of what we
[43:54] would CALL THE MESSAGE, BUT NOTHING'S
[43:56] ever really changed in their life. THEY
[43:59] MAYBE COMETH TO JUSTIFICATION and we
[44:01] find them repenting of every sin and
[44:04] they cry out to the Lord. MAYBE THEY
[44:06] EVEN COME TO A PLACE of sanctification
[44:08] where they're washed, but they don't
[44:10] ever go far there to receive the Holy
[44:13] Ghost life and the society or their
[44:16] community begins to regulate how they
[44:19] move and adjust in their lives.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; We could see that religion, brother
[44:24] Brandham preaches against and he says,
[44:26] "Come out of her my people." He speaks
[44:28] against denominational system. BUT IF
[44:30] WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE COULD FIND
[44:32] OURSELVES GETTING INTO A DENOMINATIONAL
[44:35] THOUGHT RIGHT IN OUR OWN MIDST, WHICH WE
[44:38] WOULD CALL the message. What a blessed
[44:39] word to say, I AM IN THE MESSAGE. BUT IF
[44:42] IT HAS BECOME A TITLE OF A DENOMINATION
[44:44] for you and I, we have missed what God
[44:47] is trying to do.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; I have a little maybe if the the
[44:53] brothers have a picture there, I have a
[44:55] little illustration. Brother Brandham
[44:57] talks about a hog. And he says a sinner
[45:00] is a sinner.
[45:02] You know, JUST LIKE A HOG CAN'T BE
[45:05] NOTHING else but a hog.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; THOSE FELLAS THERE, THEY they're hogs.
[45:10] And I hope you don't mind me having a
[45:12] picture like that in the church, but
[45:14] sometimes it gets into our minds. You
[45:16] know, Brother Brandon would say that you
[45:18] can take THAT FELL AND WASH HIM up and
[45:21] dress him up and put some anointing
[45:24] smells upon him and bring him on into
[45:26] the house, but that pog will always be a
[45:30] hawk.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; And I don't care. I say that very not
[45:35] sternly, but I I want to say LIKE IT
[45:38] DOESN'T MATTER TO ME HOW MUCH education
[45:40] you have.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; If you don't know the author real well,
[45:43] you're still a sinner.
[45:46] If you're just going according to the
[45:48] community friend, you're still a sinner.
[45:51] If religion is all you got, you're still
[45:53] a sinner. That hog, he likes to root
[45:56] around. He he pushes his note down nose
[45:59] down into that filth. He's there on
[46:02] Monday through Saturday in the filth of
[46:04] the world. He's digging and rooting in
[46:07] the worldly music. Come on, somebody.
[46:10] He's digging and rooting around the
[46:12] entertainments of this world.
[46:16] He's there looking in the filth AND THE
[46:19] GARBAGE. WHY? BECAUSE he is a pig.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; The hig THE HOG IS ONLY LIVING ACCORDING
[46:27] to his nature. He he he's trying to HE'S
[46:31] JUST TRYING TO FIND WHAT HE CAN SOME
[46:33] LITTLE THINGS. AND WE can't res we can't
[46:35] scold him. We we can't be angry at him.
[46:38] The prophet would say we can't reform
[46:40] him. He's doing exactly
[46:43] as God has called him to do as a hog.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And so I look at our lives. We know that
[46:50] we were all born in sin. Just take a
[46:51] moment back and realize where you came
[46:53] from.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; You were born in sin and shaped in
[46:57] iniquity. YOU WERE A SINNER, BUT GOD
[47:00] CAME and saved you by HIS GRACE. LET ME
[47:03] JUST REMIND WE DON'T PREACH THIS WAY
[47:04] OFTEN, BUT I I want to JUST GO SIMPLY TO
[47:07] REMIND US THAT GOD in his gratefulness
[47:10] has come by his mercies
[47:14] &gt;&gt; and transformed us from a beast.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; WE ALL are beastly natured.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; WE ALL HAD SOMETHING INSIDE OF THAT WAS
[47:23] NEGATIVE. BUT GOD BY HIS GRACE, HIS
[47:25] MERCY as the scripture has said has come
[47:28] in our lives and the the transforming
[47:31] power of God has changed us.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And so my prayer today as I'm preaching
[47:36] to you, even to myself, Lord, let the
[47:38] power of the Holy Ghost begin to lead us
[47:41] as the great shepherd.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Do you remember David in the 23rd Psalm?
[47:48] He he was speaking and he's the great
[47:50] he's speaking of the great shepherd.
[47:53] In verse 5, HE SAYS, "THOU ANOINTEST my
[47:56] head with oil and my cup runth over."
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Now, David in 1st Samuel chapter 16:E3,
[48:06] he was anointed from the horn of oil.
[48:09] There Samuel came and I don't want to go
[48:11] through the story, but you recall it
[48:13] very Samuel came and brought the boys
[48:15] before him and brought David out of the
[48:17] field. him there. David was anointed
[48:19] with the horn of oil and the spirit of
[48:22] the Lord came upon David. How many
[48:25] remembers that in the scripture?
[48:27] &gt;&gt; And so I like to make this statement
[48:29] asking you the question, DO YOU KNOW for
[48:32] assurityity that you have been anointed
[48:34] by the horn with the Holy Ghost and
[48:37] power?
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Have you really really come to a place
[48:41] where you know that you're changed?
[48:44] that you come to a re of birth, but not
[48:47] just a re been reborn, but the Holy
[48:50] Ghost power is living and acting through
[48:52] your life, and you're moving in God's
[48:55] direction. You're doing exactly what God
[48:58] has called you to do.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; We're not all pulpit ministries, but we
[49:03] are all ministers before the Lord. And
[49:06] God is calling us to DO SOMETHING TODAY.
[49:08] GOD IS ASKING US TO BE A MINISTER before
[49:11] him, but you need the power to come
[49:14] before
[49:15] &gt;&gt; you and guide you and lead you in all
[49:17] truth.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; And so I want you to see that it's not
[49:21] just an anointing in our flesh. And we
[49:23] we don't want to ride a dead horse this
[49:26] evening speaking about our flesh, but I
[49:28] just want you to understand it's not
[49:30] about our flesh.
[49:33] It's not about how our flesh gets
[49:35] anointed, BUT IT'S WHAT GOD DOES IN THE
[49:38] DEPTHS OF OUR soul that the anointed
[49:41] word, THAT SEED WORD OF GOD IS MOVING
[49:44] AND IT'S expressing itself through your
[49:46] life.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; How many's experienced that before?
[49:49] Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; You know, there was an occasion I was a
[49:52] young man. My wife and I traveled up
[49:53] into Ontario to some special meetings
[49:55] and and you know, uh uh there was a a
[49:58] wonderful brother, brother Steven
[50:00] Francis, that was speaking there in that
[50:01] meeting. And I was sitting sort of in
[50:03] the mid congregation and as he was
[50:06] preaching the word of God and he was
[50:08] teaching and it and it was strong and
[50:10] and I was listening and I I want to say
[50:12] something in the side of me b to bubble
[50:16] as the word was begin to preach. It was
[50:19] not my flesh. It wasn't the music. It
[50:22] wasn't the atmosphere that somebody
[50:24] could make, but it was the word that
[50:26] begin to change on the inside of the
[50:29] inside. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT begin to
[50:31] bubble with inside OF ME. AND THAT IS
[50:34] THE SEED WORD THAT does it in the midst
[50:36] of the house of God.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we're used to coming
[50:40] to the services and and and we become
[50:43] spectators. I I I want to say I'm the
[50:46] first ones sometimes on a Wednesday
[50:47] night when you're tired.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Anybody tired on a Wednesday?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Well, sure we are. We get good and tired
[50:57] and we've worked hard all day and
[50:59] sometimes we're just going to come and
[51:01] it's like I'm going to buy a ticket to
[51:02] the service and I'm just going to watch
[51:04] and the minister can just, you know,
[51:07] entertain me for just a little and we'll
[51:09] go shake hands and it'll be wonderful
[51:11] because everybody's seen that I was
[51:12] dedicated.
[51:15] I came to church.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah, you're all the same. I'm
[51:20] just like you. And that's how we are.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; BUT WE DIDN'T COME TO BE ENTERTAINED.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; WE COME TO PRAISE THE LORD.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Some of us say, "Amen." Hallelujah.
[51:32] RAISE A HAND. OTHERS SAY, "AMEN." SOME
[51:34] might clap their hands. Some might grin.
[51:37] THAT'S ALL FINE AS long as you're
[51:39] letting the word be expressed through
[51:42] your life. Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; The seed word coming into being right in
[51:46] the house of God. And so we are anointed
[51:49] now to serve God. We are anointed to
[51:52] take dominion.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS HAS CALLED US TO TAKE AUTHORITY
[51:57] over the enemy.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; That's why we sing a wonderful song like
[52:01] we believe Lord and we PUT YOUR WORD TO
[52:03] ACTION. WHATEVER IT IS, WE believe Lord
[52:06] that you can heal us from stomach
[52:09] trouble, from cancers, from things that
[52:12] so easily beset us. We can be healed in
[52:14] the name of Jesus Christ.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; And so David, he was anointed by the by
[52:19] the horn. He was anointed by the oil in
[52:22] the horn. It was resembling the the the
[52:24] Holy Ghost in his life. And just the
[52:27] SAME AS YOU AND I, David was anointed to
[52:29] be king. But you and I by faith have
[52:32] been anointed to be kings
[52:34] &gt;&gt; and priests before God.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Can you catch that revelation?
[52:40] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU CATCH WHO YOU ARE?
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Predestinated sons of God.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Revelations 5 10 would say it like this.
[52:49] And he has made US UNTO OUR GOD kings
[52:54] &gt;&gt; and priests.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; These offices before God. and we shall
[52:59] reign on the earth. As a king AND AS A
[53:03] PRIEST, YOU MUST TAKE DOMINION. YOU MUST
[53:06] TAKE YOUR INHERITANCE. YOU MUST REALLY
[53:08] CATCH THE REVELATION WITH THAT LIFE,
[53:10] THAT TRANSFORMING POWER LIFE, THAT QUICK
[53:13] LIFE THAT YOU HAVE THE authority to
[53:16] speak
[53:18] &gt;&gt; and God will back what your words are if
[53:21] they're according to the word of God.
[53:24] Brother Brandon would say to us, you're
[53:26] you're not a Christian by desire.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; You're a Christian by God's
[53:34] &gt;&gt; desire.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; You've been anointed. The horn, the Holy
[53:38] SPIRIT HAS POURED OVER YOUR LIFE. THE
[53:40] GREAT SHEPHERD HAS ANOINTED YOU, YOUR
[53:42] HEAD WITH AR OIL IN YOUR LIFE IS
[53:44] TRANSFORMED, RENEWING BY your mind. I
[53:47] want you TO SEE THAT GOD HAS
[53:49] TRANSFORMED, CHANGED your life. BUT
[53:52] THERE ARE MANY TIMES THAT YOU'RE not
[53:54] mine needs to be renewed by the mercies
[53:57] of God. Every single day we need a
[54:00] renewing.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, renew us.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; His mercies make us new. Every morning
[54:06] we need to call upon the Lord just that
[54:08] way that the mind of Christ
[54:11] would reign and direct us in our
[54:13] everyday lives.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say a reality to
[54:17] dwell in a channel. THE REALITY TO DWELL
[54:21] in the channel of Christ.
[54:24] Now in 1954 in the message of witnesses,
[54:27] brother Bradam says you can't have the
[54:30] mind of Christ and the mind of the world
[54:34] at the same time.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Now take a deep breath.
[54:41] I think this quotation is so good. I
[54:44] speak like in evangelistic tone just now
[54:48] and I hope you don't mind but you can't
[54:51] serve Christ and the world at the same
[54:53] time.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; You can't be in your own way and God's
[54:59] way at the same time. You have to get
[55:01] out of your own way to let God have his
[55:07] way. Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; In the message 1955 in water of
[55:11] separation, the mind of Christ in you.
[55:15] That's the only way I can stay alive.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Now, he's not talking just about this
[55:21] mortal life. He's talking OUR SPIRITUAL
[55:23] LIFE.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; HE'S TALKING ABOUT THAT MIND OF CHRIST.
[55:26] We must to enter into his mind daily. We
[55:30] need to dig into the word of God AND
[55:32] ALLOW THE MESSAGE OF THIS hour that we
[55:34] all love so dearly
[55:36] &gt;&gt; God
[55:37] &gt;&gt; begin to teach us and lead us and direct
[55:40] us.
[55:42] Many times we have what we have as
[55:44] digital devices and and you know we all
[55:47] have good intentions of entering into
[55:49] the digital device and reading the
[55:53] message or reading our Bibles but
[55:55] somehow with the devices we get so
[55:58] distracted.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Well, when I say amen, I I I want to say
[56:04] amen too. Amen, brother Steve.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're distracted by these DEVICES
[56:10] AND SOMETIMES GOD'S GOT TO settle us
[56:12] down and we need to take the word and
[56:14] open it up and not go to YouTube to see
[56:16] what it says or some other minister
[56:18] says. LET'S SEE WHAT GOD SAYS THROUGH
[56:20] THE prophet's voice.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart
[56:25] &gt;&gt; because we need to be able to stay alive
[56:28] in this time of darkness. Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God hovered over the
[56:36] earth in Genesis chapter 1.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And now I'm asking the Lord that he
[56:40] would come and hover over a people, over
[56:42] believers today.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; That he would speak his word into our
[56:47] lives that will quicken seeds with
[56:49] inside of us.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST BECAUSE WE HEARD some
[56:53] information, BUT LORD, QUICKEN IT. BRING
[56:56] IT TO LIFE. BRING IT TO REAL REVELATION
[56:58] inside of us. Make it part of us.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; In the natural, we say, "You are what
[57:04] you eat."
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Allow it to be that the word of God,
[57:07] we're feasting upon it, AND IT BECOMES
[57:09] EXACTLY WHO WE ARE.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; We don't have to FALSIFY ANY DOCUMENTS.
[57:15] WE DON'T HAVE TO TRY TO PRODUCE evidence
[57:17] that we're Christians. I pray, I really
[57:20] pray that if there was something that
[57:22] would convict me or or cause me to be uh
[57:25] convicted, it would be that I would be a
[57:28] real SON OF GOD.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; THAT ALL you could see IS JESUS. THAT
[57:31] ALL I COULD SEE INSIDE OF YOU. THAT
[57:34] WOULD BE THAT the world would convict me
[57:36] and and say something who I am. They
[57:38] would say Jesus Christ lives in a
[57:40] people. Jesus Christ lives in me.
[57:43] Quicken the seed word, Lord.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Now, we are anointed. I want to show you
[57:48] this now that we are anointed from the
[57:50] horn of salvation.
[57:53] In Luke chapter 1:69, it says that he
[57:56] has raised up a horn of salvation. In
[58:00] the Old Testament, there's some language
[58:01] that we use and it references Jesus
[58:04] Christ as the strong one as God. HE'S
[58:07] OUT OF THE HORN, IT SPEAKS comes forth
[58:11] Christ, the anointed one. OUT OF THAT
[58:14] HORN COMES FORTH the seven compound
[58:16] names of God.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Now you know something. I I I was quite
[58:20] amazed on Sunday when I was sitting just
[58:22] over here and listening to the word of
[58:24] God intently and brother Ron you been to
[58:27] go and speak about the seven compound
[58:29] names of God. And you know I had them in
[58:32] my notes and I thought for oh Lord
[58:34] Brother Ron's going to go all the way
[58:35] down and preach my notes on the seven
[58:38] comp compound names of God. But you know
[58:40] how God works divinely. And we want to
[58:42] see here that God works in these names.
[58:45] Jehovah Gyra that provides all of our
[58:48] needs.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; I still need a God that provides my
[58:51] needs.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; This world is pretty miserable, upset.
[58:57] Have you read the news lately?
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Things that are going on. I need a God
[59:02] that provides.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; I need Jehovah J Rafa,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; THE LORD THAT IS MY HEALER.
[59:10] Yes sir.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; More than ever now with the world and
[59:13] the science and brother Brown talks
[59:14] about science and the power
[59:16] transformation. He you KNOW WE NEED GOD
[59:19] TO COME AS OUR HEALER AND WE NEED TO
[59:21] TRUST HIM AS our healer.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; We need our Lord our peace. We need our
[59:28] Lord our banner. We need him that Lord
[59:31] who IS THERE. THE LORD of our
[59:33] righteousness. And we need the Lord our
[59:36] shepherd.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Yay. Though I walk through the valley of
[59:40] the shadow of death,
[59:43] &gt;&gt; I will fear no evil, for he is with me.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; His rod, his staff, they cover me. A rod
[59:48] that guides, a rod of correction. I need
[59:51] this this shepherd, the great shepherd
[59:54] to lead me along the way.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; You know, we talk about a valley and
[59:59] most of us know that, you know, we do
[1:00:01] most of our living in the valley.
[1:00:04] Brother Rando says we have mountain tops
[1:00:06] experiences and we have valleys.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; He talks about HOW THAT ALL OUR fruits
[1:00:11] would freeze up here on the mountain
[1:00:13] tops.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; And he says most of the time we live in
[1:00:16] a valley.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look at the valley as a
[1:00:20] negative place to reside. A valley is a
[1:00:22] oh my that's where the trials and the
[1:00:24] test. But I want you to know you grow
[1:00:26] food in the valley.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Children are birthed in the valley.
[1:00:32] THERE. ALL KINDS OF GOODNESS happens in
[1:00:34] the valley. And I begin to think of the
[1:00:36] prophecy that's spoken, how our Lord
[1:00:39] Jesus would come AND HE HE WOULD BRING
[1:00:41] THE MOUNTAINS LOW AND THE valleys high.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; And we find out that our Lord Jesus, he
[1:00:46] sits there on our daytoday life in the
[1:00:49] valley. He's with us there guiding AND
[1:00:52] LEAD US. THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A
[1:00:54] VALLEY OF DEATH, LOW IT LOOKS LIKE
[1:00:56] THERE'S A TRIAL, HE'S ALWAYS THERE
[1:00:58] LEADING US. THIS IS THE POWER THAT'S IN
[1:01:02] US. This is the ONE THAT IS GUIDING US
[1:01:04] this evening.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be a people that's
[1:01:09] anointed with formalism.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be just a formal
[1:01:16] people?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; NO, WE WANT TO WE DON'T WANT JUST
[1:01:19] THEOLOGY.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO BE ANOINTED BY THE HOLY
[1:01:23] SPIRIT.
[1:01:25] You want to BE ANOINTED BY THE HORN OF
[1:01:27] GOD WHICH WE SAID OUT OF THE HORN WHICH
[1:01:29] SPEAKS OF CHRIST. You see man, they
[1:01:32] always try to shift for themselves. The
[1:01:34] prophet would say always trying to do
[1:01:36] their own thing, ALWAYS TRYING TO HELP
[1:01:38] GOD. But I I want you to see in Samuel
[1:01:42] chapter 89, we won't go into it fully,
[1:01:44] but we see that Israel, you know, they
[1:01:47] they so desired to have a king. They so
[1:01:50] desired TO TO BE LIKE THE other nations.
[1:01:53] THEY THEY THEY THEY WANTED EVERYTHING
[1:01:55] LIKE THE OTHERS HAD. Many times we see
[1:01:58] that in our own assemblies. We want to
[1:02:00] look like the denominational churches.
[1:02:03] WE WE WE WANT TO HAVE THE platforms the
[1:02:05] same. We want the music's the same. We
[1:02:07] want to we want to just have everything
[1:02:09] that looks so good. And but REMEMBER
[1:02:13] ABEL'S altar was the bleeding lamb.
[1:02:15] ABEL'S ALTAR. WE COME TO THIS HOUSE. I
[1:02:18] COME TO this place not to be entertained
[1:02:21] to buy A TICKET. I I come here to see
[1:02:23] the believing word of God. I COME TO
[1:02:25] HEAR FOR ONE PURPOSE,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS TO HAVE GOD'S AUTHORITY TO
[1:02:31] SPEAK INTO MY LIFE, TO LEAD ME, TO TEACH
[1:02:33] ME, TO GUIDE ME, TO ALLOW THAT WORD TO
[1:02:36] BUBBLE UP THROUGH MY LIFE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; And so, Israel wanted to have a king.
[1:02:43] They wanted to be like the other
[1:02:45] nations. And Samuel was he felt
[1:02:47] rejected. And Samuel came before the
[1:02:50] Lord. And the Lord spoke to him and
[1:02:52] said, "Samuel, they haven't rejected
[1:02:53] you.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; They have rejected me."
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; SO MY HEART GETS SMOKED. LORD, I I DON'T
[1:03:00] WANT TO HAVE THIS ATTITUDE WHERE I WANT
[1:03:02] TO BE LIKE THE WORLD OR DENOMINATIONAL.
[1:03:05] I DON'T WANT TO REJECT YOU, LORD. I WANT
[1:03:07] TO HAVE YOU LEAD ME, FATHER. AMEN.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And so Samuel was spoken and told to the
[1:03:15] Lord that he should go anoint Saul a
[1:03:18] king after the people after their own
[1:03:21] desires.
[1:03:23] So I asked THAT QUESTION AND HOW DID HE
[1:03:25] DO IT? Did Samuel go do and anoint Saul?
[1:03:30] Well, in 1st Samuel 10:1, the Bible
[1:03:33] says, "Then Samuel took a vial."
[1:03:36] I want you to see that vial is a flask.
[1:03:41] It's a bottle filled with oil. And he
[1:03:45] poured it upon the head of Saul. NOW
[1:03:48] NOTICE that vial, THAT FLASK, that
[1:03:53] bottle was a man-made container.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE IS NOT BY ACCIDENTING
[1:04:00] writing and saying they took a A A
[1:04:02] FLASK. NO. IN DAVID, YOU'LL READ IT IN
[1:04:04] JUST a moment. For David, he brought the
[1:04:07] horn.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; FOR DAVID, HE BROUGHT the horn that was
[1:04:11] filled with oil. And that horn has a
[1:04:14] representation BECAUSE WE SEE IT NOW IN
[1:04:16] THE BOOK OF LUKE OUT FROM IT'S CHRIST.
[1:04:18] THE HORN COMES FORTH. The spirit of God.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; And so, we don't want a man-made
[1:04:25] anointing.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; We want God's anointing to come IN OUR
[1:04:33] LIVES. WE DON'T WANT JUST A FLASH IN THE
[1:04:35] PAN AS THE brother brother Brandon would
[1:04:36] say
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; and trying to do God a service without
[1:04:40] his will.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Remember the HOLY SPIRIT CAN COME AND
[1:04:44] ANOINT A person and still it's out of
[1:04:48] THE WILL OF GOD.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE?
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; SAUL WAS KING. HE WAS ANOINTED. GOD
[1:04:54] SPOKE SAID, "HEY, ANOINT SAUL." BUT IT
[1:04:58] WAS NOT GOD'S PERFECT WILL.
[1:05:02] We don't want to be drinking from a
[1:05:04] man-made container.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; We want to be drinking from what God has
[1:05:09] called us to drink from.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; God commissioning Moses, Saul found out
[1:05:14] that that theological vest of his did
[1:05:17] not fit a fit a man of God. And it
[1:05:20] usually it don't.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Our theologies.
[1:05:26] A lot of times we'll get up here and
[1:05:28] many times men will quote theology and
[1:05:32] there's no power of God behind it.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; We have to ask the Lord, Lord, let the
[1:05:38] power come and spill upon your people.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Remember, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FLESH
[1:05:43] NOW. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WORD THAT
[1:05:45] STIMULATES OUR LIVES TO GROW FURTHER
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; INTO THE GOSPEL, FURTHER INTO THE WORD.
[1:05:53] NOT JUST TEACHING BY education that we
[1:05:55] can UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT NO LORD
[1:05:57] REAL REVELATION DIVINE teaching
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; The oil it causes us to thirst. It
[1:06:06] causes us to thirst more of God's
[1:06:08] presence as a deer pandeth after the
[1:06:10] water. So my soul longs after thee, oh
[1:06:15] God.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Well, that's how we feel this evening.
[1:06:18] I'm sure most of us in the congregation.
[1:06:21] There's a deep calling to a deep with
[1:06:23] inside and there is a deep to respond.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; I think that's why we're all here today.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Why on the Wednesday night when you're
[1:06:30] tired, why would you come? But you have
[1:06:32] a deep calling. Lord, we want more
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; of you.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; And so Samuel when he pours that oil
[1:06:40] upon David, he pours it upon him
[1:06:42] unsparingly upon him. He pours it from
[1:06:45] THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND DRIPS down his
[1:06:47] face onto his shoulders as it would be
[1:06:49] like THE PRIEST BEING ANOINTED ALL THE
[1:06:51] WAY DOWN TO HIS PAPS down to his feet.
[1:06:53] And brother Brandon was saying the great
[1:06:55] warrior David said, "And that's THE WAY
[1:06:58] THAT GOD pours the Holy Ghost on a man,
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; not sparingly,
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; just baptizes HIM INTO IT, ANOINTING HIM
[1:07:08] WITH the spirit." Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice as it hit
[1:07:13] David, IT STRUCK DAVID, IT TORN DOWN HIS
[1:07:15] HIS HIS head down to his feet. It began
[1:07:18] to positionally place him as a king.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we want the oil of the Holy
[1:07:26] Ghost to strike us that way that we
[1:07:28] would allow the Holy Spirit to guide us
[1:07:30] and and bring us into a place OF OUR
[1:07:33] ADOPTION TO KNOW EXACTLY who we are.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. YES, SIR.
[1:07:40] WHEN THIS oil comes upon you, I want to
[1:07:42] speak naturally to you. YOU WILL
[1:07:44] RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR PAST LIFE does not
[1:07:47] define you.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Lots of times we have a past and we have
[1:07:51] things that we carry like baggage upon
[1:07:53] our shoulders and we and we limp around
[1:07:56] with that baggage on and on and on in
[1:07:58] our lives. And until we let THAT THING
[1:08:00] GO, GOD CAN'T FURTHER us into the
[1:08:03] kingdom of God.
[1:08:05] Your weaknesses DO NOT DISQUALIFY YOU.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD USES YOUR WEAKNESS for his his
[1:08:13] glory. I CAN DO ALL
[1:08:16] things through Christ who strengthens
[1:08:19] me.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Your limitations don't restrict God.
[1:08:25] WHATEVER YOU FEEL YOUR LIMITATION might
[1:08:27] be, CAST THAT ASIDE. GOD WANTS to use
[1:08:30] you. Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have to think about and be
[1:08:33] complexed ABOUT YOUR LIMITATIONS. ALLOW
[1:08:35] GOD, resist the devil AND ALLOW THE GOD
[1:08:38] OF HEAVEN TO USE YOU IN ALL THAT YOU ARE
[1:08:42] purposed for
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; because the oil of the Holy Spirit is
[1:08:45] poured upon your life.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Do you remember in Genesis chapter 1,
[1:08:52] we find that on the earth it was earth
[1:08:54] was in a a condition where that no human
[1:08:57] could ever fix. The Bible said that the
[1:09:00] world was without form and void and
[1:09:03] darkness was on the face of the deep.
[1:09:07] BUT THAT'S WHEN GOD DOES HIS BEST.
[1:09:10] THAT'S WHEN GOD BEGINS TO SPEAK AND GOD
[1:09:13] SAID, "LET THERE BE." AND immediately it
[1:09:16] came about and begin to happen. And the
[1:09:18] scripture says the spirit of the Lord
[1:09:21] moved upon the face of the waters.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; The face OF THE WATERS. THERE. IT WAS
[1:09:28] ALL THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT VOID. IT WAS
[1:09:31] IT WAS A PLACE OF CHAOS UNTIL THE LOGOS
[1:09:34] OF GOD be to move upon the face of the
[1:09:40] earth.
[1:09:42] Brother Brandon was saying in
[1:09:43] impersonation of Christianity, he said
[1:09:45] the Holy Spirit brood it out on the
[1:09:47] earth
[1:09:49] and he kept brooding. I want you to
[1:09:51] notice those words brooding. I like it.
[1:09:54] And as he cooed, I also like that word
[1:09:56] couped. As he cooed and brewed, it began
[1:10:00] TO SEE TREES COME UP, birds fly from the
[1:10:04] earth, ANIMALS BEGIN TO WALK. AND THEN
[1:10:07] HE KEPT ON couping and man came up
[1:10:10] called Adam.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Now I I just cuz who I am, I I looked up
[1:10:15] those words trying to figure out what
[1:10:16] coup and brood means. And we find that
[1:10:19] coup that speaks about uh you know uh
[1:10:21] talking fondly and the sound of of a
[1:10:25] content dove. I think that's the nature
[1:10:27] of a real believer.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody that's positive.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; We got a lot of negativity around.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Negativity back and forth and
[1:10:39] unhappiness back and forth and I don't
[1:10:41] like this and I don't like that. And
[1:10:44] well, we have that in Washington. And I
[1:10:46] maybe not here in Phoenix, but we got
[1:10:48] that.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S PRESENCE AMONGST HIS PEOPLE.
[1:10:53] AND WE ALL SAY WE'RE FILLED WITH THE
[1:10:55] HOLY SPIRIT. THERE SHOULDN'T BE THIS
[1:10:58] NEGATIVITY THAT BREATHES AMONGST PEOPLE.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; We should HAVE THE LOVE OF GOD IN
[1:11:03] ABUNDANCE IN OUR HEARTS. WHY? BECAUSE IT
[1:11:05] H WE CARRY THAT REPRESENTATION OF HIS
[1:11:08] SPIRIT. HE COOED. HE SPOKE FONDLY AS A
[1:11:11] SOUND OF A CONTENT DOVE. AMEN.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Brooding it means showing deep happiness
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; of a thought.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; So when the spirit of God begin to move
[1:11:26] upon the face of the earth, the whole
[1:11:29] picture began to change.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Well, you think of your own life. You
[1:11:35] think about when the Holy Spirit begin
[1:11:36] to move upon your life, begin to coup
[1:11:38] and brute UPON YOUR LIFE. THE PICTURE OF
[1:11:40] YOUR LIFE BEGIN to change.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. YES, SIR.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; SO, I SEE THAT IN ORDER for a seed to
[1:11:47] grow,
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; it needs to have sir
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; good conditions,
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; good ground,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; and it needs TO HAVE A GODLY wordbased
[1:11:59] atmosphere
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; for a seed to grow. Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; SO UNDER THIS ATMOSPHERE,
[1:12:07] every seed that God spoke WOULD COME
[1:12:11] FORTH OF ITS KIND.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; I'd like to linger here for just a
[1:12:16] moment so you can really think because
[1:12:18] this is about you.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; You're the seed OF GOD.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; YOU COME forth out of the loins of God.
[1:12:26] And under every good atmosphere OF THE
[1:12:29] WORD, EVERY SEED WILL come forth.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Steve, my children are
[1:12:35] we are we wayward." Bring them to
[1:12:37] church.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; The atmosphere OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IS
[1:12:41] RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING. I don't know
[1:12:43] if you sense it this evening, but the
[1:12:45] Holy Spirit is with us.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Right here in the building.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; BRING YOUR FAMILIES. BRING YOUR LIVES.
[1:12:51] IF YOU HAVE UPSET IN YOUR LIFE, BRING IT
[1:12:54] TO THE LORD. COME TO CHURCH. DON'T MISS
[1:12:56] IT. DON'T STREAM. DON'T YOU FIND
[1:12:58] YOURSELF OUT THERE IN THE INTER WORD
[1:13:00] INTERNET LAND. FIND YOURSELF IN THE
[1:13:02] ATMOSPHERE OF THE LOGOS WORD.
[1:13:06] YES, SIR.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Atmosphere matters.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Because every seed, I want you to KNOW
[1:13:13] THIS IN GENESIS, every seed already was
[1:13:16] in the ground. The prophet teaches us so
[1:13:19] eloquently. Genesis 1:1, in the
[1:13:21] beginning, God created. PERIOD. SO
[1:13:25] EVERYTHING WAS INSIDE OF THE GROUND, BUT
[1:13:28] WHAT IT NEEDED WAS WARMTH.
[1:13:31] IT NEEDED THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE for the
[1:13:33] seeds to come forth.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; If I could just for a moment, I I I want
[1:13:40] us to think I I have a a personal
[1:13:42] illustration that I want to bring to
[1:13:44] you.
[1:13:45] Family and I, we went on a little
[1:13:47] vacation, and I have a picture of it,
[1:13:49] right, of something like it that we went
[1:13:51] to. We went to something called a
[1:13:53] butterfly conservatory.
[1:13:56] Now, in my manly self, I'm a little
[1:13:58] ashamed to tell you that I went, but
[1:14:03] but uh for the sake of the illustration,
[1:14:05] I I'm putting myself out there, but I
[1:14:08] I'll say it like this, brothers. I was
[1:14:10] dragged by my wife.
[1:14:14] So we went to this conservatory
[1:14:18] and the conservatory as you can see it
[1:14:21] was lush. It was tropical.
[1:14:25] It was warm. Now as many you know I I I
[1:14:28] went you go through a door
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; and then they have these plastic sheets
[1:14:32] and you you go through the plastic
[1:14:34] sheets. Oh, I see some of the men
[1:14:36] nodding that you're all as manly as me.
[1:14:38] You all went.
[1:14:40] So you go THROUGH THIS AND IMMEDIATELY
[1:14:43] you feel warmth,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; And you feel the humidity of the air,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; AND YOU FIND OUT, you smell around and
[1:14:54] it smells like blossoming flowers.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You look with your sight and you see
[1:14:59] that the trees are thriving
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S COOL TRICKLING WATER AND
[1:15:06] PONDS AND STREAMS. AND INSIDE OF THE
[1:15:09] POND, IT'S NOT JUST A STAGGERING SISTN,
[1:15:12] but it IT'S FULL OF LIFE. IT'S TEEMING
[1:15:14] WITH LIFE. IT HAS STRENGTH WITH IT. I
[1:15:16] WANT YOU TO SEE RIGHT THERE. THE
[1:15:18] ATMOSPHERE IS BUILT FOR SOMETHING.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; I believe that our lives should be just
[1:15:27] like this. AMEN.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; OUR LIVES SHOULD BE SO WARPED BY THE
[1:15:32] SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; THAT PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE MISSING THE
[1:15:37] FACT THAT you're a believer.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; You go to the work sites and immediately
[1:15:41] you don't have to say a word, but the
[1:15:43] other men they curse and repent because
[1:15:46] oh I didn't mean they don't know you
[1:15:48] WERE A CHRISTIAN. THEY DON'T KNOW
[1:15:50] ANYTHING ABOUT YOU. BUT THERE IS A
[1:15:52] WARMTH.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. When you come into the house of
[1:15:57] God, you come and you walk through THOSE
[1:15:59] DOORS AND IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN LAY YOUR
[1:16:01] BURDENS DOWN. IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN PUT
[1:16:03] YOUR SWORD IN YOUR SHEATH. IMMEDIATELY
[1:16:06] YOU CAN OPEN YOUR HEART. IT'S NOT THAT
[1:16:08] YOU HAVE TO CLOSE EVERYTHING AND SAY,
[1:16:10] "I'M GUARDED." NO. DROP IT ALL IN THE
[1:16:13] HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Flowers blooming. The place is teeming
[1:16:19] with life. Your eyes see God's presence
[1:16:21] moving. It's the atmosphere that changes
[1:16:24] things.
[1:16:25] Brother Brandham in prayer many times
[1:16:28] but this is one occasion he says make
[1:16:30] the whole atmosphere Lord a creative
[1:16:33] atmosphere
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; that let there be right here in the
[1:16:38] house of God you can have anything you
[1:16:40] desire
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; you say well that was just for sister
[1:16:43] Hattie right she said the right words
[1:16:45] but NO WHEN YOU COME WITH THE RIGHT
[1:16:47] ATTITUDE BEFORE GOD AND SAY AMEN TO THE
[1:16:50] THUS SAYETH THE LORD ANYTHING YOU HAVE
[1:16:52] NEED OF IS YOURS YOU CAN HAVE IT THIS
[1:16:55] EVENING.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; A creative atmosphere of the soul, one
[1:17:02] mind, one accord, one purpose.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; You see here that the atmosphere then
[1:17:07] will bring results. He continues to say,
[1:17:10] "And if every person here would get into
[1:17:12] one perfect harmony,
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; one perfect harmony."
[1:17:20] You know, I I noticed, was it brother J
[1:17:23] brother uh Austin that was playing the
[1:17:25] piano today?
[1:17:27] You know, he played the chords and it
[1:17:29] was beautiful and he played really good
[1:17:32] in harmony to the other instruments and
[1:17:34] they played around with just nice music
[1:17:36] for us to hear. But if there was one
[1:17:38] little note that was out of place, we
[1:17:40] would notice it, wouldn't we?
[1:17:42] BUT GOD IS ASKING US FOR TO BE A PEOPLE
[1:17:46] THAT HAVE COME INTO A STATURE OF A
[1:17:48] PERFECT MAN. A PEOPLE THAT HAVE RAISED
[1:17:52] UP INTO A CAPSTONE MINISTRY THAT CAN
[1:17:56] LIVE IN ONE MIND UNDER THE SPIRIT OF THE
[1:17:58] WORD THAT CAN COME FORTH WITH because
[1:18:01] they have transforming power inside of
[1:18:04] our life.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; We would get in perfect harmony. It
[1:18:07] would be settled. See, like the natural
[1:18:10] way of an egg is hatched is put under
[1:18:12] the hand. It'll hatch because it's the
[1:18:15] atmosphere.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; It's warm.
[1:18:19] Now, let's just look back to my
[1:18:20] conservatory illustration for just a
[1:18:22] moment. This uh conservatory, I want you
[1:18:26] to notice that it it exists for only one
[1:18:28] reason,
[1:18:30] and that is to produce butterflies. Look
[1:18:33] at this next picture I want to show you.
[1:18:35] Butterflies. beautiful
[1:18:38] butterflies
[1:18:40] under this ATMOSPHERE THAT WE LOOKED AT
[1:18:42] JUST BEFORE. Something happens with
[1:18:45] inside of this insect BEFORE IT BECOMES
[1:18:49] A BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY. SOMETHING IN ITS
[1:18:51] LIFE IS TRIGGERED. IT'S A IT'S A DYNAMIC
[1:18:54] CHANGE.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Something is imprinted in the next
[1:19:00] picture into this little fella. Right.
[1:19:04] Yeah.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; This guy does not look like that
[1:19:07] butterfly.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; When we were little kids, we looked to
[1:19:10] find them, pick them off the trees, and
[1:19:14] and uh
[1:19:19] THESE GUYS ARE NOT BEAUTIFUL, BUT THE
[1:19:21] LAST PICTURE YOU WOULD ALL SAY IS
[1:19:23] GORGEOUS.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; In fact, I stood there chasing with a
[1:19:26] popsicle stick and sugar.
[1:19:31] Gorgeous. But something is on the inside
[1:19:34] of that LITTLE WORM.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; AND AS HE'S INCHING in the forest, as
[1:19:39] he's inching, just going climbing the
[1:19:42] trees and eating, he in his heart,
[1:19:45] something is calling him to the sky.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING'S TELLING HIM HE DOESN'T
[1:19:52] BELONG AS A WORM.
[1:19:55] SOMETHING IS ANOINTING HIM FOR CHANGE
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; JUST AS IT IS IN OUR LIVES. THERE'S A
[1:20:03] LAW OF THE SEED inside of our lives
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; just it WAS IN THE BEGINNING. ALL THAT'S
[1:20:09] WITH INSIDE OF YOU LAYS THERE AND IT MAY
[1:20:12] BE DORMANT FOR A SEASON. It may be a
[1:20:15] mystery TO YOU. BUT WHEN GOD BEGINS TO
[1:20:18] OPEN THAT WHICH IS IN YOUR LIFE, IT
[1:20:20] COMES FORTH. YOU ONCE WERE A WORM. YOU
[1:20:24] ONCE WERE A P PERSON THAT WAS DEFORMED,
[1:20:27] BUT NOW YOU HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THE
[1:20:30] RENEWING OF YOUR MIND.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; OH, everything that was once buried in
[1:20:38] the water lay there in a mystery. But as
[1:20:40] we even heard on Sunday, that we find
[1:20:43] out that that great is the mystery of
[1:20:45] godliness. You and I recognize it's
[1:20:48] Christ in us, the hope of glory
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; that has changed our life. I didn't
[1:20:54] understand it. I was born into a message
[1:20:56] home. I sat on the pew. I was just like
[1:20:58] all these fellas and I had to come to my
[1:21:00] own experience with God. But there was
[1:21:02] something that was calling me. I was
[1:21:05] wandering in a chicken barn and I was
[1:21:08] clucking with the hands. But something
[1:21:10] CALLED TO ME. YOU'RE NOT BORN FOR THIS
[1:21:12] BARNYARD. YOU'RE NOT JUST BORN TO FLY UP
[1:21:15] A ONE LITTLE PLACE OF A CHICKEN POST,
[1:21:17] BUT YOU ARE BORN FOR THE SKIES.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Every seed will bring forth of its kind.
[1:21:25] Brother Brandon would emphasize saying
[1:21:26] an oak tree, it will bring forth an oak
[1:21:29] tree and a palm tree and a palm tree and
[1:21:32] we will come forth. We will come forth
[1:21:35] as sons and daughters of God.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:42] Oh, brother Steve, I don't know.
[1:21:44] Too many weaknesses. I got too many
[1:21:47] hang-ups. I got too many complexes. I
[1:21:50] barely get from day to day. Find myself
[1:21:52] in so much spiritual depression. I I
[1:21:55] don't even know. I hardly can make it to
[1:21:56] the surface. But I I want you to know
[1:21:59] that God sees you like he would see that
[1:22:02] butterfly.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; He doesn't look at you at that wiggling
[1:22:05] worm. He doesn't look at you something
[1:22:07] that is unperfect. He doesn't look at
[1:22:10] you as one that's deformed. That's
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; No, he looks at you that you've already
[1:22:14] been transformed. He looks at you like
[1:22:17] you're perfect in him. Every seed THAT
[1:22:19] HE PLANTED IN THE GARDEN WAS PERFECT.
[1:22:21] AND EVERY SEED THAT HE PUT UPON THIS
[1:22:23] EARTH THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE ADOPTION OF
[1:22:25] SONS IS PERFECT before him.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Fact, when God spoke of you, he said it
[1:22:33] was very good.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; I want to gouge you today. I don't know
[1:22:38] if there's somebody in the building
[1:22:39] today, but it's put on my heart really
[1:22:41] strongly. It's put it to encourage the
[1:22:43] bride that you're perfect in Jesus
[1:22:45] Christ and you are good. Everything is
[1:22:47] good. Oh, brother, I'M FULL OF SIN. GOD
[1:22:49] WILL BRING YOU TO A MATURITY. GOD WILL
[1:22:51] BRING YOU TO A PLACE WHERE YOU ARE MEANT
[1:22:53] FOR THE SKIES. BUT KEEP PRESSING IN ONTO
[1:22:55] THE MARK OF THE HIGH calling
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:23:02] transform happens friends. It's a daily
[1:23:05] thing in our lives that we are being
[1:23:07] renewed.
[1:23:08] Now, Satan desires to to get you off
[1:23:12] your guard.
[1:23:14] He knows one thing is that he can't get
[1:23:16] to the womb of your soul because it's
[1:23:18] already sealed.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; He recognizes, BUT HE WILL TRY TO
[1:23:23] distract you. kind of like brother
[1:23:24] Brandham talks about walking in a corn
[1:23:26] field AND HE NOTICES THAT WHEN A LITTLE
[1:23:28] PIECE of corn OR A LITTLE SOMETHING
[1:23:29] THERE, YOU KNOW, THE THE STOCK there's a
[1:23:31] rock on it and and it begins to bend up
[1:23:33] and there's something deforming its way.
[1:23:36] BUT GOD KNOWS HOW TO TAKE THAT THING OFF
[1:23:38] OF YOUR LIFE. YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCAR AND
[1:23:41] YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING CROOKED THAT
[1:23:42] LOOKS CROOKED IN YOUR LIFE, BUT GOD'S
[1:23:44] NOT LOOKING AT THE CROOKED PARTS.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; GOD IS LOOKING AT THE FRUIT THAT COMES
[1:23:50] FORTH OUT OF YOUR LIFE. HE'S LOOKING AT
[1:23:53] THE SEED WORD THAT IS COMING FORTH IN
[1:23:55] manifestation upon your life.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; But it's so important today to guard our
[1:24:03] minds.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Does ever the enemy ever come and try to
[1:24:07] distract you in your thoughts?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; I just told you you're perfect before
[1:24:12] God. I told you that God loves you. I
[1:24:15] told you that you should not have a
[1:24:16] complex. OF SATAN WILL COME IN, SLIP ON
[1:24:19] into into your mind, and it begin to
[1:24:22] distract your mind. BUT IF I COULD GO
[1:24:25] JUST FOR A MOMENT BACK TO DAVID and how
[1:24:27] David was ANOINTED BY THE HORN OF THE
[1:24:30] OIL, I WANT YOU TO SEE THAT THE OIL WAS
[1:24:33] POURED UPON his head.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Wasn't upon his feet.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Wasn't upon his shoulders. No, it was
[1:24:41] upon his head. And that ALSO IS THE TYPE
[1:24:44] OF THE HELMET OF SALVATION THAT WOULD
[1:24:48] PROTECT OUR HEAD, our horn, JESUS
[1:24:51] CHRIST, PROTECTING OUR MIND. BECAUSE
[1:24:53] REMEMBER, WE'RE RENEWED BY WHAT? OUR
[1:24:56] MINDS. LORD, TRANSFORM US BY THE
[1:24:59] RENEWING THE MIND of Christ.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Continually in a side of our lives.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Well, we ought to be protecting our
[1:25:08] head. Young men, protect your head.
[1:25:11] Protect your mind. boy, girl, man,
[1:25:14] woman, WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR MINDS
[1:25:16] because the mind, THE GREATEST BATTLE
[1:25:18] EVER FOUGHT IS IN OUR MINDS.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Remember the pro, this is simple, but
[1:25:24] let me tell you, the prophet of God
[1:25:26] said, you're not responsible for the
[1:25:27] bird that flies over your head. YOU'RE
[1:25:30] RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NESTING it does. AND
[1:25:32] AND AND WE CAN'T ALLOW THE ENEMY TO NEST
[1:25:35] IN OUR MINDS, WHETHER IT BE IN THE FILTH
[1:25:37] OF THIS WORLD OR BY DOGMAS or creeds or
[1:25:41] doctrines. WE NEED TO STAY IN THE TRUTH
[1:25:43] OF THE DIVINE. SAY WHAT THE TAPES SAY.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; The mind is a battlefield. And Paul, he
[1:25:52] warns, "Be not conformed
[1:25:56] to this world."
[1:25:58] Don't put your life out there to be
[1:26:00] conformed to what we are presently
[1:26:02] calling the world. The world's pressures
[1:26:04] are on us are thick. But let's not think
[1:26:06] because as a man thinks in his IN HIS
[1:26:10] HEART, SO HE IS.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; WELL, I I just wonder sometimes while
[1:26:14] we're driving down the road, what are we
[1:26:15] thinking about it? We're in our trucks,
[1:26:17] in our cars, we're on the way.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Where is our mind?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Where is it drifting to? Is your mind
[1:26:27] upon Christ?
[1:26:29] Maybe you're even listening or streaming
[1:26:33] another service and your mind is
[1:26:36] directed to all those things that are
[1:26:38] critical AND NOTHING POSITIVE. WHERE IS
[1:26:40] YOUR MIND?
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; YOUR ONLY FOCUS TO BE IN THAT AREA IS
[1:26:45] NOT FOR MIND ENTERTAINMENT. It's to hear
[1:26:47] THE WORD OF GOD. LET THIS MIND BE IN YOU
[1:26:50] AS IT WAS IN CHRIST JESUS. FOCUS YOUR
[1:26:53] MIND UPON THE WORLD AND DO word and do
[1:26:56] not be conformed to this world. Amen.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Well, the enemy is on a prowl
[1:27:03] and his desires to get at you. Now,
[1:27:06] remember we talked about the great
[1:27:07] shepherd and David was a shepherd. He
[1:27:09] often talked about shephering and you
[1:27:12] know in Palestine you find in the
[1:27:15] summertime they have a lot of flies
[1:27:18] and these flies they're nasal flies and
[1:27:20] they they you know I I did some research
[1:27:23] research and I find out that they they
[1:27:24] fly and they get up into the sheep
[1:27:26] inside of their nose and it causes
[1:27:29] inflammation and infection and that
[1:27:32] infection can often LEAD TO BLINDNESS OR
[1:27:36] IT CAN KEEP THE sheep from eating. King,
[1:27:41] I have a spiritual principle behind all
[1:27:43] of this.
[1:27:45] When these nasal flies get in the nose
[1:27:48] of the sheep causing infection, it could
[1:27:51] cause blindness or keep the sheep from
[1:27:55] eating.
[1:27:57] NOW, NOTICE THE BIBLE SPEAKS OF SATAN
[1:28:00] being Belzeub,
[1:28:03] the lord of the flies.
[1:28:05] AND SATAN KNOWS THAT THE WOMB OF YOUR
[1:28:08] HEART, AS I SAID MOMENT AGO, IS SEALED.
[1:28:10] BUT HE WILL IRRITATE YOU AND BRING
[1:28:13] INFECTION TO YOUR LIFE SO THAT IT WILL
[1:28:17] CAUSE YOU TO HAVE SPIRITUAL BLINDNESS.
[1:28:20] YOU WILL WALK AROUND WITH EYES OPEN
[1:28:22] SERVICE AFTER SERVICE, BUT YET BE BLIND
[1:28:25] AS SAMSON WAS. AND YOU WILL HAVE TO COME
[1:28:28] TO A PLACE AND SAY, "LORD, ONCE MORE."
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:35] If you allow Satan, the lord of the
[1:28:38] flies, bleub to come into your life,
[1:28:40] that way you may even come to a place
[1:28:43] where you stop eating of the word.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; It comes in, but doesn't drop to the
[1:28:48] heart.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:28:52] the enemy tries, but the Bible gives us
[1:28:56] a remedy for those that are sick
[1:28:57] naturally and spiritually.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Would you like to hear what that is?
[1:29:02] Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Simply in James 5:14,
[1:29:07] "If any be sick among you,
[1:29:10] LET HIM CALL FOR THE ELDERS of the
[1:29:12] church and let them pray over him,
[1:29:15] ANOINTING HIM WITH OIL,
[1:29:18] THE SYMBOL OF THE HOLY GHOST IN OUR
[1:29:20] LIVES."
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; In the NAME OF THE LORD, AND THE PRAYER
[1:29:24] AFFAIRS SHALL SAVE THE SICK, AND THE
[1:29:26] LORD SHALL RAISE HIM UP. ISN'T THAT THE
[1:29:29] PROMISE? spiritual blindness removed,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; your appetite restored,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; and if any have committed sins, they
[1:29:40] shall be forgiven.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Just as you never
[1:29:44] did it in the sea of God's
[1:29:46] forgetfulness.
[1:29:48] We we need to come to this PLACE WHERE
[1:29:50] WE HUMBLE OURSELVES AND RECOGNIZE, LORD,
[1:29:53] THE ENEMY HAS STRUCK UP INFECTION AND
[1:29:55] I'M NOT FEEDING AND I KNOW THAT I NEED
[1:29:58] THE OIL BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY THING
[1:29:59] THE SHEPHERD DOES IN Palestine is HE
[1:30:02] POURS OIL ALL OVER THE SHEEP OVER his
[1:30:04] head in order to keep the flies away. WE
[1:30:08] NEED CHRIST TO ANOINT US.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:15] Paul in Romans 12:1 is beseeching. You
[1:30:18] have a few minutes yet for me?
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I I promise I won't be long.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; But Paul is beseeching. He's pleading
[1:30:25] urgent urgency for us to surrender. He's
[1:30:28] saying, I plead to you that you ARE NOT
[1:30:30] CONFORMED. I PLEAD TO YOU THAT YOU
[1:30:32] PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE,
[1:30:35] NOT A DEAD ONE AS THE OLD TESTAMENT
[1:30:37] SACRIFICES, BUT A DAYTO-DAY LIVING
[1:30:40] SACRIFICE before God.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. an everyday life before God
[1:30:46] because an everyday life needs to press
[1:30:49] forward to the mark.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; We're in our last part of the scripture
[1:30:53] now. Pressing forth. I press toward the
[1:30:57] mark of the prize of the high calling of
[1:30:59] God IN CHRIST. WE'RE PRESSING FORWARD
[1:31:03] LIKE AN ATHLETE.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; WELL, the Bible often compares our faith
[1:31:09] to running a race. How many knows that?
[1:31:13] A race demands focus.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Runners, you have to focus.
[1:31:21] In a sport,
[1:31:23] no one wins by quitting halfway.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; We get tired. WE CAN'T KEEP RUNNING.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; AN ATHLETE, THEY TRAIN LONG. THEY TRAIN
[1:31:35] HARD.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; They wake up early. My these are
[1:31:38] spiritual applications I'm trying to
[1:31:40] bring to you in the natural. But look at
[1:31:42] them spiritually. THEY WAKE UP early
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; and they train hard and they repeat it
[1:31:50] over.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine? We don't have the
[1:31:53] Olympics going on, but those people,
[1:31:55] they train and train and train and train
[1:31:57] to run one event, maybe two events, and
[1:32:00] they did it their whole life. And
[1:32:03] someone, let's say the 100 meter, it's
[1:32:05] over in seconds.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; WE'RE TRAINING. WE'RE IN A BATTLE. WE'RE
[1:32:12] TRAINING.
[1:32:14] WE OUGHT TO BEGIN TO HAVE SOME endurance
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; to get into the word of God.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm not against this, but some
[1:32:25] of us have these little boxes with our
[1:32:28] little daily bread, little papers in
[1:32:30] them.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Well, I have one on the piano
[1:32:36] and and you know, we walk by sometimes
[1:32:38] in the morning. Lord, I don't have time
[1:32:40] to read a whole chapter today because I
[1:32:43] slept in last night. We were up with the
[1:32:45] friends and we're, you know, playing
[1:32:47] disc golf or Top Golf and
[1:32:51] we were all having fellowship and
[1:32:53] brothers, you know, they want me to come
[1:32:56] at 7 a.m. in the morning for breakfast.
[1:32:58] How ridiculous was that?
[1:33:03] You know who you are.
[1:33:08] I hold brother Don Saunders personally
[1:33:10] responsible for that.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; So what do we do sometimes? We go over
[1:33:15] to those little things. We pull a little
[1:33:17] marker and we read a one sentence and WE
[1:33:19] SAY, "LORD, BLESS us this day." And we
[1:33:21] say, "We've done our devotion, our due
[1:33:23] diligence before the Lord."
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; You think you're going to win a race?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; NO. WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME DILIGENCE, some
[1:33:34] some directive, SOME TO REPEAT THE
[1:33:37] DRILLS AND PUSH THROUGH THE PAIN WHEN IT
[1:33:39] HURTS
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.
[1:33:43] SOMETIMES WE HAVE A GLORY TIME AT CHURCH
[1:33:45] AND OTHER TIMES IT'S SLUGGING. IT
[1:33:46] DOESN'T ALWAYS FEEL GOOD.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; But we have to fix our eyes not on our
[1:33:54] circumstance, but on the finish line.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; MY GOAL. THERE'S A PRIZE BEFORE. THERE'S
[1:34:01] A GOAL.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK ABOUT A SOLDIER JUST NOW. A
[1:34:06] SOLDIER, HE CAN'T BE A a a a a a a a a a
[1:34:08] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:34:08] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:34:09] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:34:09] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:34:09] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:34:09] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:34:09] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:34:09] a a a a a a a a a a a a a CRY BABY. HE'S
[1:34:11] GOT TO BE FIRM AND SOLID AND AND FULL OF
[1:34:14] VIGOR. HE HAS TO KNOW THAT HE'S FIGHTING
[1:34:16] FOR A PURPOSE.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT TO REALIZE THAT WAR IS
[1:34:21] DANGEROUS, BUT YET HE'S THERE WILLING AS
[1:34:24] HE'S TRAINED TO DEFEND. HE HAS DESIRED
[1:34:27] TO ADVANCE, NOT RETREAT.
[1:34:31] It doesn't say the first part of his
[1:34:33] playbook at the very sight of the enemy
[1:34:36] run.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; A CHRISTIAN, THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE
[1:34:41] FULLY ARMORED BY THE ARMOR OF GOD.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE THAT WORD retreat in our
[1:34:48] hearts and our minds.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; It's forward.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of a little story I heard one
[1:34:55] time.
[1:34:57] They were fighting a vigorous battle and
[1:34:58] they were against the enemy and it
[1:35:00] looked like they were going to lose and
[1:35:03] the great general he called out to to
[1:35:05] the trumpeter. You know, the trumpeter
[1:35:07] would blow either forward or retreat.
[1:35:11] And so he called out, "Retreat,
[1:35:13] RETREAT." AND THE BUGLER GOT OFF THE
[1:35:16] trumpet and he begin TO BLOW.
[1:35:20] AND THE THE company that was TO DEFENSE
[1:35:22] THE GOOD ARMY. THEY JUST WENT FORWARD AS
[1:35:25] HARD AS THEY COULD. The saving grace of
[1:35:28] it all was they won the battle. At the
[1:35:31] end, THE GENERAL CALLED THE BUGLER. AND
[1:35:33] he said, "For sir, I told you to
[1:35:35] retreat. I know we won the battle, BUT I
[1:35:37] CALLED YOU TO RETREAT. WHY IN THE WORLD
[1:35:40] DID YOU PLAY THE FORWARD?"
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; All I knew.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. As the brother said,
[1:35:47] it was the only tune the bugler knew was
[1:35:50] forward.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't learn the retreat song.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; When we sing songs in here, I WOULD NOT
[1:35:59] BE DENIED. I WOULD NOT BE DENIED.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; UNTIL JESUS CAME AND HE MADE ME WHOLE.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT going to be denied. I'M GOING TO
[1:36:10] PRESS IN.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YES, SIR.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:36:16] We have courage in obedience to the word
[1:36:19] OF GOD AND WE PRESS IN NO MATTER HOW WE
[1:36:22] QUAKE in fear.
[1:36:25] One more example brother Brandham uses
[1:36:27] and I won't tell the whole story but
[1:36:30] remember Arnold von Rickled Reed
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; and if you're Dutch I'm or Swiss I'm
[1:36:36] sorry that I butchered that name but
[1:36:40] that fell HE TO THE SWISS people he he
[1:36:43] was a legend a legend of hope BECAUSE
[1:36:46] WHEN EVERYTHING LIKE IT LOOKED LIKE IT
[1:36:48] WAS LOST
[1:36:50] and their families WOULD BE KILLED THEIR
[1:36:52] FARMS would be burned
[1:36:54] There was one MAN
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; BY THE NAME OF ARNOLD WHO WAS WILLING TO
[1:36:59] STEP OUT AND SAY, "LISTEN, MY SWISS
[1:37:01] BRETHREN, THIS DAY I GIVE MY LIFE for
[1:37:05] Switzerland
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; and my home life land."
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT OUR ATTITUDE SHOULD BE.
[1:37:13] THIS DAY I GIVE MY LIFE FOR MY COUNTRY.
[1:37:15] NOT FOR OUR NATURAL COUNTRY. BUT THIS
[1:37:18] DAY I HONOR, I STRIVE, I PRESS FORWARD
[1:37:22] FOR THE MARK OF THE HIGH CALLING.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST PRESS FORWARD FOR MY VOCATION.
[1:37:28] OH, I want to be a nurse or a doctor and
[1:37:30] a counter. I want to be a plumber, a
[1:37:32] carpenter, or a painter. NO, THAT'S NOT
[1:37:34] WHAT WE'RE PRESSING FOR. THOSE ARE
[1:37:36] VOCATIONS. VOCATIONS. We have to do
[1:37:39] those things in order TO GO BY. BUT OUR
[1:37:41] FIRST HOPE, OUR FIRST HALLELUJAH, OUR
[1:37:44] FIRST DESIRE,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; MY ONLY DESIRE IS JESUS CHRIST.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; IN HIM ALONE, I PRESS FORWARD.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; WHY? Because once I was a sinner. Once I
[1:37:57] was a hog. Once I was like that beastly
[1:37:59] thing that was on THE PICTURE, FULL OF
[1:38:01] SIN. BUT JESUS came in and he took my
[1:38:04] life. And he just didn't POLISH IT UP.
[1:38:06] HE JUST DIDN'T JUST ADJUST IT, BUT HE
[1:38:08] CHANGED IT FOREVER. AND EVERY SINGLE DAY
[1:38:12] BY THE MERCIES OF GOD.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; BY GOD'S MERCY, HE RENEWS MY MIND.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; SO, we press forward. What are we
[1:38:26] pressing forward? Into the anointing of
[1:38:29] God.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Into that logos anointing that said,
[1:38:33] "Let there be light." And it came about.
[1:38:36] We look for the oil of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:38] not to be poured upon our heads with a
[1:38:40] man-made system like a flask, but we
[1:38:42] say, "Lord, take the horn and take that
[1:38:45] oil and pour it upon our heads, which
[1:38:47] the horn is Jesus Christ." And then we
[1:38:50] realize,
[1:38:52] "Oh, God, we're not meant for this
[1:38:55] world."
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know, saints,
[1:39:02] we're not meant to build houses and
[1:39:04] build up lands.
[1:39:06] Sometimes I look at and friends, I'm not
[1:39:08] against striving to do well for our
[1:39:11] natural beings, but sometimes that seems
[1:39:13] to be the only focus on people's minds.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; They want to feel good and lay a sea of
[1:39:21] they want to have everything just check
[1:39:23] boxes, check, check, check, check,
[1:39:25] check. Then they come to church and they
[1:39:27] just want a feeling check, check, check,
[1:39:28] check. And they never want to press in
[1:39:30] or have any sort of discipline. But God
[1:39:32] is calling a people higher. You're not
[1:39:34] born to be a worm.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; LET SOMETHING STRIKE INSIDE YOUR BEING
[1:39:41] CALLED REVELATION THAT IS IMPRINTED
[1:39:43] THERE FROM THE BEGINNING. A SEED AFTER
[1:39:45] HIS OWN KIND TO SAY, "I AM A BUTTERFLY
[1:39:48] OR I AM AN EAGLE. I'M MEANT FOR THE
[1:39:51] SKIES."
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; We must reach our high calling. Yes,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; we must reach the goal.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; many have gone before us.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Many have died at the stake. Many have
[1:40:10] been reproached and they didn't have the
[1:40:12] full light like we have. But you and I,
[1:40:15] we're holding in our possession the open
[1:40:17] book, the revealed word of God. We have
[1:40:19] the portion in our hands and we're
[1:40:22] eating the book and our lives are living
[1:40:24] out the message of the hour. Friend,
[1:40:27] just don't squander and waste it.
[1:40:30] Don't let every everyday life just kind
[1:40:33] of overwhelm you.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; No. Come up higher.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; And sing with me the song as the
[1:40:39] musicians come. There is a change in me.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Since Jesus has set me free. I'VE BEEN
[1:40:48] TO CALVARY. I've been born again. All
[1:40:51] this thing of this world, they're passed
[1:40:53] away. It's my flavor of it's long gone.
[1:40:55] the thoughts of the world, the intents
[1:40:57] of the world, whatever it might be,
[1:40:59] whatever your distraction might be, get
[1:41:01] rid of it in Jesus' name and come up a
[1:41:03] little higher
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; in the purity of God's word.
[1:41:09] As the musicians begin to play that,
[1:41:11] there's been a change in me.
[1:41:14] Heavenly Father, I thank you for this
[1:41:16] opportunity.
[1:41:19] My heart is to encourage the people as
[1:41:22] they're well taught by a wonderful
[1:41:24] pastor to continue moving forward to
[1:41:26] press in
[1:41:29] Lord that their hearts would focus on
[1:41:32] the real thing, the main thing
[1:41:35] and not just things that are around them
[1:41:37] and how much they can earn and how much
[1:41:40] they can possess. But Lord, how much
[1:41:42] rather when we call upon your name, how
[1:41:45] you can come near us and give us more of
[1:41:47] your life and you begin to coup and woo
[1:41:49] over us and a seed comes forth and
[1:41:52] brings forth a a life,
[1:41:56] brings forth fruits of righteousness and
[1:41:58] holiness.
[1:41:59] We thank you, oh God, for this
[1:42:01] opportunity.
[1:42:03] I look around us, there are many people
[1:42:05] that would like to have this
[1:42:06] opportunity, but you came to a special
[1:42:08] people called from the beginning because
[1:42:11] their seed was in the ground and under
[1:42:13] the right atmosphere. Lord, it wasn't us
[1:42:16] doing the choosing. You called us and
[1:42:17] brought us forth. And now we are here
[1:42:20] joined with Jesus Christ, filled with
[1:42:22] the Holy Ghost, and come to a place of
[1:42:24] adoption. We thank you for that, Lord.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; But may we not squander it, Lord, with a
[1:42:29] wasteful life. May we push and press
[1:42:32] forward
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; there's you know the song
[1:42:45] you don't know the song that's okay
[1:42:47] brother Jonathan come and lead us in the
[1:42:49] song where stand to your feet
[1:42:52] let's sing this song that day playing
[1:42:55] father one more time
[1:43:00] if there There be somebody in the
[1:43:01] building, Lord, that needs a special
[1:43:03] touch from you.
[1:43:07] I pray, Father, that your spirit would
[1:43:09] go to them now and begin to move in
[1:43:12] their soil.
[1:43:14] Move upon the seed, Lord, that's in
[1:43:16] their life.
[1:43:19] It's burst open, Lord.
[1:43:21] May the sun the sen strengthen so the
[1:43:23] life may come forth
[1:43:29] Lord that it would come not just up a
[1:43:30] stalk and then to a tassel but there
[1:43:32] would be fruit upon it
[1:43:36] Lord that they would come to a place
[1:43:37] where their life is basking in the sun
[1:43:40] ripening Lord
[1:43:44] this is our desire
[1:43:47] if our mind has been clouded change us
[1:43:49] Lord
[1:43:50] I pray that the Lord if there'd be
[1:43:52] anybody in the building that would erase
[1:43:53] their hand and say, "Lord, be merciful
[1:43:54] to unto me and renew my mind. Lord,
[1:43:58] you've changed me, Lord. I'm assure of
[1:43:59] it.
[1:44:01] But renew my mind. Encourage me, Lord,
[1:44:03] that I might know that I'm perfect in
[1:44:05] you with a renewed mind every day,
[1:44:09] Brother Jonathan, in Jesus Christ."
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Spread your wings to the winds of faith.
[1:44:16] Spread your wings. Spread your wings
[1:44:22] to the winds of faith.
[1:44:26] You can fly
[1:44:30] in a higher place.
[1:44:35] Do not struggle.
[1:44:39] It's by grace.
[1:44:43] Set your wings
[1:44:47] to the wind of
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; And let's sing. Shout to the Lord. Shout
[1:44:51] to the Lord. Amen.
[1:44:56] My Jesus,
[1:45:01] my savior.
[1:45:04] Lord, there is none
[1:45:07] like you.
[1:45:10] All of my days
[1:45:14] I want to praise
[1:45:18] the wonders of your mighty
[1:45:24] love.
[1:45:26] My comfort,
[1:45:29] my comfort,
[1:45:34] my shelter,
[1:45:37] tower of reuge and strength.
[1:45:43] Let every breath,
[1:45:47] all that I am,
[1:45:51] never cease to worship.
[1:45:55] Let you
[1:45:58] shout to us. Shout to the Lord. All the
[1:46:04] earth. Let us sing.

[1:49:51] to trust him.
[1:49:55] For he has
[1:49:59] delivered
[1:50:00] me from all fear.
[1:50:08] And he has
[1:50:12] set my feet upon a rock.
[1:50:18] Oh,
[1:50:21] and thy will not be.
[1:50:28] And all say of the Lord, you are my

[1:51:22] I desire
[1:51:24] beside
[1:51:26] you.
[1:51:30] And you have made me glad.
[1:51:36] And I'll say of the Lord, you are my
[1:51:43] king.
[1:51:45] My strength,
[1:51:48] my portion,
[1:51:51] deliverer,

[1:52:24] Amen. Let's bow our heads, Lord.
[1:52:32] Truly, Lord,
[1:52:39] we need your Holy Spirit.
[1:52:47] There's so much more Lord in your word
[1:52:55] that we do not see Lord because
[1:52:58] we don't come prepared.
[1:53:01] Shame on us.
[1:53:07] The sky is the limit.
[1:53:12] And you are just waiting on us, Lord, to
[1:53:15] open up
[1:53:19] deep in our hearts, Lord, is a desire.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, when you're calling us,
[1:53:29] let our hearts be open to receive.
[1:53:36] Lord, bless us as we leave this place.
[1:53:39] Lord, let us not leave your presence.
[1:53:45] Let us do our due diligence, Lord, to
[1:53:48] wake up early and to seek your face.
[1:53:53] To put the words of life before us,
[1:53:57] to be fair, oh God, for each day that is
[1:54:01] before us.
[1:54:07] Lord, we love you. We appreciate you.
[1:54:11] Bless our church, our pastor.
[1:54:16] Lives that we live, Lord, they're not
[1:54:19] just for ourselves, but for our brothers
[1:54:21] and our sisters.
[1:54:25] Give us discernment, Lord, to see the
[1:54:28] needs in the body.
[1:54:32] In Jesus name we ask. Amen.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. I need more of you. K
[1:54:37] of F as we go. Amen. I need more
[1:54:45] of
[1:54:47] you.
[1:54:51] That's the way it's got to be.
[1:54:57] I need more
[1:55:00] of
[1:55:02] you.
[1:55:06] till there's no room left in me.
[1:55:14] All those wasted
[1:55:17] hours and minutes,
[1:55:21] they're yours now.
[1:55:23] From the start to the finish, I need
[1:55:28] more
[1:55:30] of
[1:55:31] you
[1:55:34] in me. Amen. Sing it as you go.
[1:55:41] I need more
[1:55:52] Praise
[1:55:56] mighty God.
