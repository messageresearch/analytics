[4:54] control. Let's all stand this evening.
[5:00] Let your word be born
[5:05] in the manger of my heart.
[5:10] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[5:16] Live inside this house of clay
[5:21] and mold it every day.
[5:25] Let your word be born
[5:29] in the manger
[5:31] of my heart. Let's sing the first verse
[5:34] this evening.
[5:36] To was a tiny simple stable,
[5:41] all beaten and worn.
[5:45] Oh, hardly a place
[5:48] for a king to be born. He didn't choose
[5:54] some place special
[5:56] to reveal his majesty.
[6:00] So I know if I give him control,
[6:05] he'll be born in me. If you believe that
[6:08] this evening, let your word
[6:12] be born
[6:14] in the manger of my heart.
[6:18] Let it live in me.
[6:22] Let it start.
[6:26] Live inside this house of clay
[6:30] and mold it every day.
[6:35] Let your word be born
[6:38] in the manger
[6:41] of
[6:42] my heart. Let's sing verse two.
[6:46] Well, outwardly I'm nothing,
[6:50] not much to behold,
[6:54] unlikely
[6:56] a place
[6:58] for his word to unfold.
[7:02] But if all just healed this vessel
[7:06] and let him have his way
[7:10] from glory unto glory,
[7:14] he'll change me day by day. Can you lift
[7:18] your hand? Let your word
[7:22] be born
[7:24] in the manger of my heart.
[7:28] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[7:36] Live inside this house of clay
[7:40] and mold it every day.
[7:44] Let your word be born
[7:48] in the manger
[7:51] of my heart. One more time from the top.
[7:56] Let your word
[7:58] be born
[8:00] in the manger of my heart. Is that your
[8:04] desire? Let it live in me. Let it start.
[8:12] Live inside this house of rain
[8:16] and mold it every day.
[8:21] Let your word be born
[8:24] in the manger
[8:27] of
[8:28] my heart.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's my desire this evening that
[8:33] you would just be born in our hearts.
[8:35] Amen. Before we go to the Lord in
[8:37] prayer, let's sing Healer of the Broken
[8:39] Pieces. Amen. We have a lot of needs
[8:41] this evening, but if you have a need,
[8:43] you didn't pen it down, there's a healer
[8:45] who hears it this evening. Just put it
[8:47] in his hands. Amen.
[8:49] Oh healer of the broken pieces,
[8:57] you touched my heart and made it new.
[9:05] Now my whole life I surrender. I lay it
[9:10] down before the men. Lord, I give my
[9:15] heart to you.
[9:17] Would you give him your heart this
[9:19] evening? Oh, love that saw before I knew
[9:24] you
[9:28] had brought me near to where you are.
[9:36] Oh, now I live to praise you.
[9:41] May I praise you,
[9:45] healer of my heart. Let's sing the first
[9:48] verse this evening.
[9:51] He's the healer this evening. Oh,
[9:56] you are the healer.
[10:04] Healer of my heart.
[10:11] The maker and God of all we are. Do you
[10:18] believe that this evening?
[10:21] Oh, this was me.
[10:27] I was the broken
[10:35] vessel in your hand.
[10:41] You look beyond the hurt and make me
[10:46] whole
[10:47] again. If you're thankful for that, just
[10:50] lift your hand this evening. Oh, healer
[10:53] of the broken pieces.
[10:57] Give him your need this evening.
[11:00] You touched my heart and made it new.
[11:08] Now my whole life I surrender. I lay it
[11:13] down before the men. Lord I give my
[11:18] heart to you.
[11:22] Love that song. Love that song before I
[11:26] do.
[11:30] Oh, has brought me here to where you
[11:34] are.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, now I live to praise you
[11:44] and may I praise you,
[11:48] healer of my heart.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll sing that chorus again after
[11:54] we meet our needs this evening.
[11:56] McNeely if you could come open our
[11:58] service and pray over these requests we
[12:00] have here. First, a praise report from
[12:02] Sister Gracia Castor. Praise the Lord
[12:05] for his healing touch. On Saturday at
[12:06] work, I started having back pain. On
[12:09] Sunday, I came to get prayed for and I
[12:11] have no back pain now. So, let's just
[12:13] praise the Lord for that. Amen.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Our brother Jonathan Bonga is at home
[12:18] with some lower back pain. He has two
[12:20] bulging discs. So, let's just pray for
[12:22] our brother Jonathan. Pray request for
[12:25] sister Naomi Veress. She's a homesick.
[12:28] Our pastor, brother Ron, he just needs a
[12:29] touch this evening. He's just weak in
[12:31] body. Amen. Let's sing that again. If
[12:33] you have a need this evening, just give
[12:36] it to him. Healer of the broken pieces.
[12:44] You touched my heart and made it new.
[12:52] Now my whole life I surrender. I lay it
[12:56] down before the men. Lord, I give my
[13:01] heart to you.
[13:07] Love that saw before I knew you
[13:14] have brought me near to where you are.
[13:20] Oh,
[13:23] now I live to praise you.
[13:27] Ever may I praise you,
[13:31] healer of my heart. Let's
[13:36] bow our heads and our hearts together.
[13:38] Heavenly Father, Lord, we count it a
[13:42] great honor and a great privilege that
[13:44] we can be gathered together. For we know
[13:46] your word says that where the carcass
[13:49] is, there shall the eagles be gathered.
[13:52] And so, we're here this evening, Lord.
[13:54] And we are hungry for a fresh kill.
[13:57] Father, we're hungry for the mana to
[14:00] come down from heaven to feed our souls,
[14:02] Lord. For Father God, your word says
[14:05] that uh that that if we would drink from
[14:10] the fountain of life that we would never
[14:12] thirst again. So, Father, come and feed
[14:15] us. Come, Lord, and fill our cups.
[14:17] Father, Lord, that we would no longer
[14:20] thirst for the things of the world any
[14:22] longer, but that we would hunger and
[14:24] thirst for more righteousness. Father, I
[14:27] ask this evening that you would come by
[14:29] and that you would speak to our hearts.
[14:32] Lord, you know the need that's upon each
[14:35] and every heart. You know the need
[14:38] that's in our bodies. You know the needs
[14:40] that's within every household. And so,
[14:43] Father God, I pray that faith would
[14:46] arise in our hearts that we could
[14:48] accept, Lord, the finished work that
[14:51] you've already done.
[14:54] I think Lord of our pastor this evening,
[14:57] a little tired, Lord, a little weakened
[15:00] body. Father, we pray that you would
[15:02] give him strength, Father, from the
[15:04] crown of his head to the soles of his
[15:06] feet. We ask that you would energize him
[15:09] with your Holy Spirit, Lord. And as
[15:12] brother Mario comes here this evening, I
[15:14] just pray that you would help him to
[15:17] settle his nerves, Lord, to lay the man
[15:20] aside that the lamb would speak. We love
[15:23] you, Father. We thank you for this
[15:25] opportunity and we commit all things
[15:28] into your hands for thy kingdom's glory.
[15:30] Let all things be done in Jesus Christ's
[15:33] name. Amen.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you shake your
[15:38] neighbor's hand as you're taking your
[15:39] seat this evening?
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; We have a note here from Sister Teresa
[15:47] that tomorrow will be Ronnie's 58th
[15:49] birthday. So, let's give Ronnie let's
[15:51] give Ronnie a round of applause. Happy
[15:52] birthday, Ronnie.
[15:54] Amen.
[15:56] Uh both of brother Warren's brothers are
[15:59] here this evening. They're both
[16:00] ministers in the Philippines. So we have
[16:02] brother Richard. He's a belie pastor at
[16:04] Believers Christian Bible Believers
[16:06] Christian Fellowship. And then his other
[16:08] brother Bucky who's a pastor at Pure
[16:10] Word Tabernacle. So welcome both of you
[16:12] this evening.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:17] And then we announced it on uh last
[16:20] Sunday, but we have a memorial service
[16:22] for our sister Mary directly after
[16:24] service Sunday. So there's also a signup
[16:27] sheet for food. So if you can make sure
[16:29] to sign up over there. Amen. How many
[16:32] are thankful to be in the house of the
[16:33] Lord this evening?
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. I've got to prove.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm one in a million.

[17:08] believe that? Well, I've got a proof.

[18:10] Well, I am covered.
[18:12] Covered covered by blood. I'm walking by
[18:18] faith. I'm living in love. I am covered.
[18:24] Covered covered by blood. My Jesus has
[18:29] blessed me.

[19:19] know it was blood. I know it was blood.
[19:24] I know it was love for me.

[19:34] cross. And I know it was blood for me.
[19:41] Well, they placed him into
[19:45] it.
[19:48] into glory.

[19:59] into glory.
[20:03] And when he rose up from the dead, he
[20:07] rose up from the dead. He rose up from
[20:11] the dead for me.
[20:15] Oh, one day when I was lost, he died
[20:18] upon the cross. Well, he rose from the
[20:22] dead. Oh, I know he's coming back. Well,
[20:26] he's coming back to me.
[20:29] Coming back to me. I know he's coming
[20:34] back for me.
[20:38] One day when I was lost, he died on the
[20:42] cross. And I know he's coming back for
[20:46] me.
[20:49] Well, I know it was blood. I know it was
[20:53] blood. I know it was blood for me.
[21:06] Well, I know it was love for me.

[23:36] evening. Amen.
[24:18] I come, God. I come.
[24:22] I return to the Lord.
[24:26] One who's broken. One who's torn me
[24:31] apart.
[24:35] You strike down to bind me up. You say
[24:40] you do it all in love
[24:44] that I might know you in your suffering.
[24:52] Though you slay
[24:55] me,
[24:58] yet I will praise you. Though you take
[25:03] from me,
[25:06] I will bless your name.
[25:10] Though you rule
[25:12] me,
[25:15] still I will worship. Sing a song to the
[25:20] one who's all I need.
[25:30] Oh my heart and flesh may fail.
[25:36] The earth below give way, but with my
[25:40] eyes, with my eyes I'll see the Lord
[25:47] lifted high on that day. Behold the lamb
[25:53] that was slain.
[25:56] And I'll know every tear was worth it
[26:00] all.
[26:08] And though you slay
[26:11] me,
[26:13] yet I will praise you though you take
[26:18] from me.
[26:21] I will bless your name. Though you rule
[26:27] and me,
[26:30] still I will worship. Sing a song to the
[26:35] one who's all I need.
[26:42] Though tonight I'm crying out, let this
[26:47] cup pass from me. Now you're still more
[26:53] than I need.
[26:57] You're enough
[27:01] for me.
[27:05] You're enough
[27:09] for me.
[27:14] Though you slay
[27:16] me,
[27:19] yet I will praise you. Though you take
[27:24] from me,
[27:27] I will bless your name. Though you rule
[27:32] and me,
[27:35] still I will worship. Sing a song to the
[27:40] one who's all I need.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Nick, for that song.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand as we change the
[28:00] order of service. Invite our brother
[28:03] Mario to come. Let's just sing Let It
[28:05] Rain. Amen. And that's my desire that he
[28:08] would just open up the floodgates of
[28:09] heaven. We would hear from him this
[28:11] evening. Amen. Would you open your heart
[28:13] this evening to receive from him?
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just worship him for a
[28:17] second.
[28:29] Let it rain.
[28:35] Open up the gates of heaven
[28:40] and let it rain.
[28:46] Let it rain.
[28:51] Oh, open the floodgates
[28:54] of heaven
[28:57] and let it rain.
[29:02] Let it rain.
[29:07] Would you open the floodgates
[29:11] of heaven
[29:13] and let it rain?
[29:19] Let it rain.
[29:23] Oh, open the floodgates
[29:27] of heaven
[29:29] and let it rain that you desire.
[29:34] Oh, let it rain.
[29:40] Oh, open the floodgates
[29:43] of heaven
[29:45] and let it rain.
[29:51] Let it rain.
[29:55] Oh, open the floodgates
[29:59] of heaven
[30:01] and let it rain.
[30:06] Oh, let it rain.
[30:11] Oh, open the gates of heaven
[30:18] and let it rain.
[30:23] Let it rain.
[30:27] Just open the floodgates.
[30:39] Heavenly Father,
[30:43] we bless your name tonight. Lord,
[30:47] we just want to thank you, Lord, for
[30:48] your grace and mercy. It's our prayer,
[30:51] Lord. Let your Holy Spirit pour down
[30:54] like rain tonight, Lord. Thank you for
[30:56] giving us the opportunity, Lord, that we
[30:59] have access to the tree of life, Lord.
[31:03] And may once again Lord
[31:06] may you just break the bread of life
[31:09] tonight Lord.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Once again sanctify our mind on our
[31:13] heart Lord
[31:15] that your name may have preeminence
[31:17] among us Lord. You know our needs Lord
[31:22] and
[31:24] there's nothing we can hide in your
[31:25] presence tonight.
[31:28] Help
[31:30] us to humble ourselves, Lord, that your
[31:33] spirit may speak unto us tonight. Lord,
[31:38] also we remember our pastor, Lord. May
[31:40] you just give him strength, restore his
[31:44] strength, Lord, good health, and may you
[31:48] minister to his needs tonight, Lord. So
[31:51] once again, let your Holy Spirit come
[31:54] down upon us. And we ask this in Jesus
[31:57] Christ's name.
[31:58] Amen. And amen.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:02] God bless you. Thank you, musician.
[32:03] Thank you. Amen. So, God bless you
[32:06] tonight. And we're so happy to be in the
[32:10] house of the Lord. Amen.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; And a thought come to my mind about uh
[32:16] Sadra, Mesak, and Abedneo.
[32:21] While they were throwing the furnace,
[32:26] there was a fourth man with them.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; But didn't saw it.
[32:35] They were not the one who saw the fourth
[32:37] man.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; It was King Ibukadar.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Although they didn't see it, but he was
[32:44] there.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Just like for us tonight. We may not see
[32:47] him tonight physically, but he was here
[32:51] &gt;&gt; according to his promise. Amen.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; You may not feel him, but he is still
[32:56] here.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; You may not see him, but he is still
[33:00] here.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; And he he knows all our needs
[33:06] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[33:08] And he said that
[33:11] I send my word and they heal it.
[33:16] So his word is the one that will heal.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; He knows our needs. Sometimes through
[33:21] the preaching of the word, he will just
[33:23] meet your needs tonight.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; And that's we how we know that God is
[33:27] with us. Sometimes after the preaching,
[33:30] you somebody else will say, "Oh, that
[33:33] scripture is for me. Oh, that sermon is
[33:35] for me." It was God. He's speaking to
[33:37] us.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; We may not see him, but he is still
[33:41] here.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[33:44] Are you excited tonight to meet the Lord
[33:46] Jesus Christ? Because he never fails.
[33:48] Amen. We fail but he never fails.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; And whenever he said that there are two
[33:53] or three are gathered in his name, he
[33:55] will be in our midst. Amen.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; And we believe it even we don't see it,
[34:00] we don't feel it, but we just believe it
[34:01] that he will do and meet our needs
[34:04] tonight.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; So let's go directly to the word of God
[34:07] in uh the book of uh
[34:11] Revelation chapter 3. Verse 17-9 is very
[34:16] common scriptures
[34:22] 3:17-9.
[34:24] Just say amen when you are there.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Uh so the scripture said because thou
[34:29] sayest I am rich and increase with goods
[34:32] and have need of nothing
[34:35] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[34:37] and miserable and poor and blind and
[34:39] naked. So the loudian
[34:43] um assist themselves that they are rich
[34:45] and increase and they don't need
[34:48] nothing.
[34:49] But God assistment is that knowest not
[34:52] that thou art wretched, miserable and
[34:54] poor and blind and naked.
[34:57] So I counseledled thee to buy me of gold
[35:00] dried in the fire that thou mayest be
[35:02] rich and white raignment that thou
[35:04] mayest be cloth and that the shame of
[35:06] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[35:09] the assab with alab that thou mayest
[35:12] see.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; And as many as I love, I rebuke and
[35:16] chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent.
[35:20] So if you'll notice
[35:22] the scripture doesn't say not as many as
[35:25] love me
[35:27] but as many as I love.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Because he first love us. While we were
[35:33] yet sinners he already died and love us.
[35:35] Amen.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; So I rebuke and chasten. So expect
[35:38] rebuking and chastenment because we are
[35:41] sons and daughters of God.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because to rebuke and to encourage
[35:45] and chastise is the shows the love of
[35:48] God. Amen. So I will take my title of
[35:52] the sermon, gold dried in fire.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; So you may now be seated.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. So brother Warren uh welcome back
[36:03] brother Warren.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; And also brother Richard, brother Baky,
[36:07] welcome to Arizona.
[36:09] So they were their grandpa was my uh
[36:13] former pastor in the Philippines.
[36:16] So they were just single during that
[36:18] time but now they're married. They
[36:20] established their ministry
[36:22] and I look myself and I'm getting old.
[36:27] So God bless you. Welcome to Arizona.
[36:29] Praise God. So I will uh take uh the
[36:34] subject of gold tried by fire and uh in
[36:39] Genesis chapter 2 we know that
[36:41] everything that uh we can see in the
[36:43] book of revelation start in the book of
[36:45] Genesis. So in the book of Genesis
[36:47] chapter 2 10 it said and the river went
[36:50] out of Eden to water the garden and from
[36:53] then it was parted and became into far
[36:57] four four heads and the name of the
[37:00] first is pyon or what do you call that
[37:03] pyson or pison that is which composite
[37:06] the whole land of havilla where there is
[37:10] gold and the gold of that land is good.
[37:13] So this is the first time that gold was
[37:16] mentioned in the Bible.
[37:18] And we know that uh everything that God
[37:21] created in the natural in the earth in
[37:24] its original form speaks of greater
[37:27] things in the spiritual.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; And we know that everything that God
[37:31] created in the earth in the beginning
[37:33] before the fall was good. Just like when
[37:35] God created the Genesis 1:3, he said,
[37:39] "Let there be light." And there was
[37:41] light. In verse four, he said, "And God
[37:43] saw the light that it was good."
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; And we know that light came by the
[37:49] spoken word and light brings light or
[37:54] brings life and e even the even the Lord
[37:57] Jesus Christ my word they are spirit and
[37:59] they are life. Amen. So we just enjoy
[38:03] that we have the spoken word which is
[38:05] the light in this dark hour that we are
[38:07] living in. We are living now in the
[38:09] evening time and the spoken word which
[38:12] God's vindicated is the light of the
[38:14] message of the hour.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; So we just enjoy the message that we
[38:18] receive. Amen. It's just by the grace of
[38:21] God that we receive it. So in the
[38:23] spiritual we are so blessed.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; But you know in the natural the sunlight
[38:28] have benefits too. So I would like to
[38:31] take my time and there are according to
[38:34] medical uh uh science there are 10
[38:37] benefits of sunlight. Number one is
[38:40] support a better sleep. I know a lot of
[38:43] as am uh anemia and they cannot sleep
[38:47] well. So sunlight according to science
[38:50] support better sleep uplift your mode.
[38:56] So research review suggests that you
[38:58] have a higher risk of depression if you
[39:01] have low vitamin D
[39:04] &gt;&gt; level. Getting some natural sunlight can
[39:07] increase the productions of vitamin D to
[39:10] help improve your overall mental health
[39:14] and well-being.
[39:16] Number three, increase energy. Number
[39:18] four, improve symptoms of mental health
[39:22] condition.
[39:23] And number five, lower blood pressure.
[39:28] So a lot of us have problem when it
[39:30] comes to high blood pressure. So
[39:32] sunlight can help lower blood pressure
[39:35] because he said that exposure to
[39:37] sunlight triggers skin to release stores
[39:41] of nitrogen oxide which cause arteries
[39:45] to dilate lowering blood pressure.
[39:50] Number six, heal inflammation.
[39:53] Also been associated with improving out
[39:57] to immune diseases.
[40:01] Then prevent cancer,
[40:04] lower risk of metabolic syndrome,
[40:08] stronger bones, extend life expectancy.
[40:13] You can have this benefit
[40:17] even going through the morning sunlight
[40:20] for five to 30 minutes.
[40:24] The natural sunlight can give you this
[40:27] benefit even if you even for just five
[40:30] to 30 minutes in the natural.
[40:34] So if we bring that benefits to our
[40:36] spiritual life
[40:38] &gt;&gt; 5 minutes to 30 minutes we become
[40:41] strong. Amen.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Because as the prophet said, you know,
[40:44] as a saints of God, your prayer is a
[40:48] million times stronger than angels.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; So we need to read our Bible, praise
[40:53] God, which is the source of life, even 5
[40:57] to 30 minutes every day.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if the natural can benefit from
[41:03] sunlight, how much more our spiritual
[41:05] life
[41:06] &gt;&gt; because as the prophet said, if you want
[41:08] to go deeper into the love of God, you
[41:10] need to read the word and pray.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to spend time because in
[41:16] the book of Revelation chapter one, he
[41:19] said that you are already blessed by
[41:21] listening and reading the word of God.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; So it's good.
[41:28] The light is good. Genesis chapter 1
[41:31] verse 10. And God called the dry land
[41:33] earth, and the gathering together of the
[41:35] water called the sea. And God saw that
[41:38] it was good.
[41:40] And the earth brought forth grass and
[41:42] herb yielding seed after his kind. And
[41:45] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[41:48] in itself after his kind. And God saw
[41:51] that it was good. So it was good because
[41:53] in every seed there was a transforming
[41:56] power within itself because the seed was
[41:58] in itself. And we know in these last
[42:01] days the prophet was given the
[42:03] instruction by angel take your pen and
[42:05] write Genesis 1 11 and 12. Let every
[42:11] seed bring forth of its kind. So there
[42:12] was an anointing being released to
[42:15] quicken the seed of God. And if we are
[42:17] the seed of God
[42:20] in non seed there is nothing to quicken.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So that's why we can be born
[42:26] because we have already seed of God.
[42:28] Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that seed was good. It
[42:30] was put in there. Praise God. It was not
[42:33] created but it was already in there. It
[42:35] just made sunlight to quicken that seed.
[42:38] And we know that we have the quickening
[42:40] power in these last days. The anointing
[42:42] was was being released that if you are a
[42:44] seed of God in these last days, you
[42:46] cannot run away from the anointing.
[42:49] Hallelujah.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; To quicken that seed.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God created the whale.
[42:56] And every living creature that move with
[42:59] the water brought forth abundantly after
[43:02] their kind, and every wingfall after
[43:04] this kind, and God saw that it was good.
[43:07] So sometimes I wonder why God so
[43:10] specifically
[43:12] said that God created great whales.
[43:17] What is the significant? Why is it that
[43:19] so important that God put
[43:22] the word he created a great whale?
[43:26] &gt;&gt; And we know, praise God, when the Lord
[43:28] Jesus Christ was being uh
[43:32] or in the time of Jonah, it was used to
[43:36] transport Jonah to Nenebe.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; While he's running from his commission,
[43:41] he's going to Tarsus. God sent the whale
[43:45] to transport him to Nbe.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why God created the
[43:50] whale.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; So in the time of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[43:55] they were asking, "Give us a sign."
[43:58] And the prophet said, "And the Lord God
[44:00] said that you adulterous
[44:03] generations, you are always looking for
[44:06] a sign, but there's no other sign given
[44:09] but the sign of Jonah, which is three
[44:11] days and three nights in a whale's
[44:13] belly."
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:15] So he identify whale's belly. So some of
[44:19] the version may call that the fish
[44:22] belly.
[44:24] So while so we don't need to search for
[44:28] different version
[44:30] the bible the king James version where
[44:32] the prophet used when he preached is the
[44:37] same thing that we need to use.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; So when the scripture it's whale it's
[44:41] whale.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So no question that's why God said
[44:45] when he created it was good
[44:48] &gt;&gt; because he know what he's doing.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; He created whale because he prepared
[44:52] somebody in the near future. Praise God.
[44:55] To use that whale to transport his
[44:57] prophet into Naobi
[45:00] &gt;&gt; to fulfill his commission.
[45:05] In Genesis 1:25, God made the beast of
[45:08] the earth after his kind, the cattle of
[45:11] terine, and everything that creepeth
[45:13] upon the earth after his kind and saw
[45:15] that it was good.
[45:17] So I will uh jump from 26 to 29. Without
[45:22] 26, God created man in his own image
[45:25] after his likeness. And God created men
[45:28] male and female and called them Adam. So
[45:31] in verse 29, and God gave them her
[45:33] bearing seed, every tree yielding fruit
[45:36] for their meat
[45:38] to every creature. So I will jump to one
[45:41] uh 31. And God saw everything that he
[45:44] made and that it behold it was very
[45:48] good. So the first time that the word
[45:50] very good and God said it was very good.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because everything was
[45:57] already in place. Everything was good.
[46:01] Everything was good. What he created man
[46:02] in his own image and everything else it
[46:05] was very good. Then he rested.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why all our need
[46:10] was already very good because already
[46:13] God knows all our needs even tonight.
[46:15] Amen. He knows our thoughts. He knows
[46:17] our problem. He knows our issues that we
[46:20] come through. And he was very good
[46:24] &gt;&gt; because he already is making a way.
[46:26] Whatever thing that comes our way, our
[46:28] life, whatever triumphs were, he already
[46:31] makes a way. And he said it was very
[46:33] good.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Man was good. His character was good.
[46:38] All animals was good. There was no
[46:40] quarrel or everything. Everything was
[46:42] good and very good. In our opening
[46:47] scripture,
[46:49] and the river went out of Eden to water
[46:51] the garden, and from then it was parted
[46:54] became into four heads the name of the
[46:56] first is pisson that is which composite
[46:59] the whole land of Havila and there is
[47:01] gold and the gold of Latan is good.
[47:05] Notice that this river that flow out of
[47:07] the garden of Eden was associated with
[47:10] the land of good gold
[47:13] and we know that natural gold speaks of
[47:15] dity and the character of God and gold
[47:19] is a precious thing and so is the gold
[47:22] Christlike character.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a go precious thing. So the
[47:27] natural thing of creation are given to
[47:29] help us understand the higher level of
[47:33] creation. So in the message the ark uh
[47:37] paragraph 134 when he preached it in
[47:40] 1955
[47:42] he said anyone who knows the scripture
[47:46] knows that gold speak of dity
[47:49] and wood speaks of humanity.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; He said you shall cover overlay it with
[47:55] gold over the wood. That's dity over the
[47:58] wood. Christ over the church inside and
[48:01] out. daty over late.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; So gold is universally accepted as the
[48:08] chief of all the metals. It speaks of
[48:11] dity in the Bible. It doesn't
[48:13] tarnishness. It doesn't rush. It doesn't
[48:15] deteriorate. It has stood the test of
[48:17] time. And down through the history, it
[48:20] has always been greatly sought after.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; For its great value and worth. And it is
[48:27] often referred to as God's money. So
[48:30] gold has a power attached to it.
[48:32] Financial power.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; So there are a lot of power in the
[48:37] earth. There's power of God. There's
[48:39] power of demons. There is power of
[48:41] ecclesiastical power. So there is
[48:44] political power, human government power,
[48:47] a civil power, milit power and there is
[48:50] a financial power and financial power is
[48:53] connected to the concept of gold.
[48:56] Even in Genesis chapter 13 verse1
[49:01] speaks about Abraham went out out of
[49:04] Egypt and he and his wife and all that
[49:07] he had and lot with him into the south
[49:10] and Abraham was very rich in cattle in
[49:14] silver and in gold.
[49:17] So gold is a storage of wealth but gold
[49:19] in nature is only revealing to us
[49:21] something that is a greater value
[49:25] &gt;&gt; because in revelation three as I read
[49:27] again because thou sayest I am rich in
[49:30] natural gold or wealth and increase with
[49:33] goods and have need of nothing. Notice
[49:35] their wealth is only in the natural
[49:37] wealth.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; And knowest not that thou was wretched
[49:41] and miserable and poor and blind and
[49:44] naked. So I counseledled thee to buy of
[49:47] me gold tried in the fire. So God is not
[49:50] talking about that we are to buy
[49:54] up all the natural gold of earth but
[49:56] that we are to pay the price
[49:59] &gt;&gt; for the gold character that can humble
[50:02] itself to the will of God.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Goldlike character that we can humble
[50:06] ourselves into the will of God. Many
[50:10] people cannot humble themselves to the
[50:12] truth of the word and they do not have
[50:15] the character to humble themselves to
[50:17] the word of this age.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Only those who are predestinated can
[50:22] humble themselves.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That thou mayest be rich and white
[50:28] ramen that thou mayest be clothed and
[50:29] that the shame on thy nakedness do not
[50:32] appear and anoint thy asab with Isa that
[50:35] thou mayest see. Anoint thy eye with
[50:38] isol which is type of the word that thou
[50:41] may see. Thou may understand and
[50:43] understand what.
[50:46] So you want to see
[50:49] understand the day that we are living
[50:51] in. So this is a spiritual seeing of the
[50:54] revelation of the word for this hour.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; But before God will open our
[50:59] understanding
[51:02] to his word, we need to humble
[51:04] ourselves.
[51:05] That's why when uh uh when he preached
[51:09] about in 1965 he preached first the
[51:12] broken sistern then he preached about uh
[51:16] lean not unto thy own understanding.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; So in this last day we need to humble
[51:21] ourselves. Don't put our own ideas our
[51:24] interpretations to the word. Let us
[51:26] humble ourselves. Amen. and trust him
[51:30] because it is his obligation to open up
[51:34] a revelation to each and every one of
[51:36] us. It is not our obligation. Praise
[51:38] God.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; But it was God's grace that will open
[51:42] himself unto us.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] So the gold of the land, we want to see
[51:49] uh uh we want to see how that financial
[51:52] power is what is being used to control
[51:54] the masses that live upon the earth. The
[51:58] gold of the land of that river that flow
[52:01] out of Eden was good. But the financial
[52:04] system of Satan Eden in this age of loud
[52:07] here is not good.
[52:10] And so it was also paralleling the
[52:12] character of this age to the character
[52:14] that man felt in Eden. Turn with me in
[52:18] the book of otherwise don't just uh we
[52:22] have I think the the board for the sake
[52:24] of time. 2 Timothy 3
[52:28] chapter 1 or chapter 3 verse 1-7 is
[52:31] describing the character of people in
[52:33] this age
[52:36] in verse one this know also that in the
[52:40] last days so he Paul is speaking in our
[52:43] day
[52:44] &gt;&gt; that's right
[52:45] &gt;&gt; amen so being a prophet he saw the
[52:48] character of the people in the last day
[52:50] he said that in the last days Purelius
[52:52] time shall come so Purelius is hard to
[52:55] deal with.
[52:57] For men should be lovers of their own
[52:59] selves.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Lovers of their own. Selfish. That's why
[53:03] the word selfie was born in this
[53:06] generation. You know selfie, selfie,
[53:09] selfie.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And if you cannot reach, so that's why
[53:14] selfie stick was invented so that you
[53:17] can reach more. And though you know that
[53:20] selfie when you have an argument it
[53:23] become the pacifier.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; When you are no no no no selfie selfie
[53:27] selfie and they will postquiring and
[53:30] they will smile and take selfie
[53:34] &gt;&gt; because people are lover of themselves.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Kovus
[53:42] kovus having a great desire to possess
[53:45] something belonging to someone else.
[53:48] Yeah,
[53:50] &gt;&gt; maybe it's an everyone knows somebody
[53:52] like that covetous and you cannot blame
[53:54] them because they have the spirit in the
[53:56] last days.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Boaster. A boaster is a person who brags
[54:02] or boasts about their achievement, their
[54:04] possession or abilities over
[54:07] exaggerating the truth to appear
[54:10] superior or more impressive to others.
[54:14] They are usually characterized by
[54:16] self-praise, vanity, obuse, displays of
[54:19] selfimportance.
[54:21] They are proud, feeling deep pleasure or
[54:24] satisfaction as a result of one's own
[54:27] achievement,
[54:29] qualities, possessions of those of
[54:32] someone with whom one is closely
[54:34] associated.
[54:37] And the next one is blasphemeir
[54:39] or blasphem. Blasphemer is the one who
[54:42] blasphe.
[54:44] Blasphemer refers to individual who show
[54:48] contempt or disrespect towards God.
[54:52] His name or sacred thing. This term is
[54:55] associated with serious moral, spiritual
[54:59] violation including verbal or written
[55:02] reproach against God characters and
[55:05] attribute. And blasphemy is considered a
[55:08] great offense in the Old Testament and
[55:11] it was punishable by death.
[55:15] So the Bible emphasizes that blasphemy
[55:18] can manifest through false accusations,
[55:21] mockery, attributing God's work to evil.
[55:24] In Leviticus 24:16, it says,
[55:29] "And he that blasphemeth the name of the
[55:31] Lord, he shall surely be put to death,
[55:37] and all the congregation shall certainly
[55:39] stone him as well as the stranger as he
[55:43] that is born in the land, when the
[55:45] blasphemous the name of the Lord shall
[55:47] be put to death." And we can say, "Oh,
[55:49] we are no longer in the Old Testament."
[55:53] But in the New Testament, in Matthew
[55:55] chapter 21, wherefore I say unto you,
[55:59] all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
[56:02] forgiven unto you, but the blasphemy
[56:05] against the Holy Ghost shall not be
[56:08] forgiven unto men. And whosoever
[56:11] speaketh a word against the Son of Man,
[56:14] it shall be forgiven. But whosoever
[56:18] speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it
[56:20] shall not be forgiven, neither in this
[56:23] world or neither in the world to come.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; So that is how serious blasphemy is.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; So a lot of people in this last day are
[56:34] blaspheing the prophet in these last
[56:36] days.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They call him this old
[56:39] derogatory uh words or names that he
[56:42] accused him
[56:45] but actually they were not accusing
[56:48] blaspheming the person but he was they
[56:51] were blaspheing the Holy Ghost that
[56:54] using is using the person
[56:56] &gt;&gt; just like in first Samuel when they they
[56:59] they they need to seek a king instead of
[57:02] God leading them
[57:05] &gt;&gt; and God told Samuel actually they are
[57:08] not rejecting me that they they are not
[57:10] rejecting you but they are rejecting me.
[57:13] Right.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Likewise, then when they blaspheme or
[57:16] put a derogatory name on the prophet,
[57:19] they are not blaspheming the prophet,
[57:21] but the Holy Ghost that was using the
[57:23] prophet.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And there is no forgiveness of that.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; And we don't need to prove that we
[57:28] arrived. We don't need to argue with
[57:30] them because they have already received
[57:33] their reward.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; And we not even judge them. But they are
[57:39] already judged by the word. Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Whosoever speaketh a word against the
[57:44] son of man, it shall be forgiven, the
[57:47] son of man, which is the flesh man. But
[57:50] whosoever speaketh against the holy
[57:52] ghost, it shall not be forgiven neither
[57:54] in this world or neither. So a very
[57:56] dangerous thing when you blasphe
[58:00] as most of the people is blaspheming now
[58:03] &gt;&gt; they put the name of Jesus a cursed
[58:05] word.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; So this is the spirit of the age. So we
[58:10] will not be surprised. Hallelujah. If
[58:13] judgment will come. Amen. Then the next
[58:16] one, disobedience to parents. And even
[58:18] the disobedience to parents is also a
[58:21] serious offense and it is also
[58:23] punishable by death.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 21:18. If a man have a
[58:31] stubborn and rebellious son
[58:35] and daughter,
[58:38] which will not obey the voice of his
[58:39] father, or the voice of his mother, and
[58:41] that they have chasted him, will not
[58:45] hearken unto them. 21 21 All the men of
[58:49] the city shall stone him with stone and
[58:53] that he die so shall thou put evil away
[58:56] from among you and all Israel shall hear
[58:59] and fear. remember, praise God,
[59:04] mostly of I can see you can even see it
[59:08] in the mole that the the children are
[59:11] fighting their father, shouting about
[59:13] their father, cursing their mothers and
[59:14] father. But the scripture, you need to
[59:18] obey your parent in the Lord. Ephesians
[59:20] 6:2, honor thy father and mother, which
[59:22] is the first commandment with a promise.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in Exodus, honor thy father and
[59:28] thy mother that the day may be long upon
[59:30] the land which is the Lord thy God
[59:33] giveth thee. Your life will prolong if
[59:35] you respect your mother father. So it
[59:37] was not limited to natural father mother
[59:39] but it was also praise God. We need to
[59:42] honor our spiritual father.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to to honor our pastor. We
[59:48] need to respect our pastor. Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We know that not every
[59:53] PASTOR ARE PERFECT. EVERY pastor has a
[59:55] flaw.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; But if God put you in a certain church
[1:00:01] under certain ministry, you need to
[1:00:03] honor the pastor.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Because the more you honor your pastor,
[1:00:07] the more you honor God.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; And if you something your pastor,
[1:00:12] instead of coming to him and and and
[1:00:14] reprove him, you need to pray for him
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; that God give him wisdom, give give him
[1:00:20] knowledge and understanding and
[1:00:22] revelation. And if you are not
[1:00:24] satisfied,
[1:00:28] then you can find another church.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; In order not to be disrespectful, you
[1:00:34] need to honor your pastor. You need to
[1:00:36] honor your father in the spirit.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; So if you feel you're not satisfied,
[1:00:43] this is not a place that can hold
[1:00:45] somebody. Oh, you need to be here
[1:00:47] because if you will not be here, you
[1:00:49] will not be saved. No, no, no.
[1:00:53] We are all free.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Because the body of Jesus Christ is
[1:00:59] mystical body of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Anywhere, any culture, any place there
[1:01:04] was there is always a church and you
[1:01:07] need to find one that can satisfy
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; your soul.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; But the thing is you need to honor your
[1:01:17] pastor.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; You need to pray for your pastor. You
[1:01:21] need to encourage him.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; We as a minister, we need encouragement.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; We need to encourage him because as the
[1:01:30] prophet said, all the arrows of the
[1:01:32] enemy are pointing on us.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; So, we'll be depending depending on God
[1:01:38] and we will be depending upon your
[1:01:40] prayers,
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; depending upon your encouragement.
[1:01:43] Because if we if we have even just a
[1:01:46] small word of encouragement, it's enough
[1:01:48] for us to go on. Amen.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Because we don't desire to be in this
[1:01:53] movie. We don't desire to be a preacher.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; It was God's gift sent to your church.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And you need to pray for every not to
[1:02:02] criticize them, but you need to pray for
[1:02:04] them
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; to encourage them. You need to go on
[1:02:07] because not everybody can preach. Not
[1:02:09] everybody is a teacher. Not everybody is
[1:02:11] evangelist. Not everybody is a pastor.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; But God put a five-fold ministry. Praise
[1:02:16] God. to edify the body until we come
[1:02:19] into the unity of deep faith.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Deep faith that can change this mortal
[1:02:24] body into immortality.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; The faith that can change, praise God,
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; this mortal body into immortality.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; So continue on verse three. unthankful
[1:02:40] and holy without natural affection, lack
[1:02:44] of instinct love and care for family
[1:02:47] member.
[1:02:49] Praise God.
[1:02:51] Truth break, false accuser, incontinent,
[1:02:54] fierce, despisers of those that are
[1:02:57] good. Oh, there's a lot of spirit coming
[1:03:00] in in these last days. We encounter this
[1:03:04] kind of spirit day by day in our lives,
[1:03:07] in our work, in our school, whatever.
[1:03:09] Even in the mold, we can encounter this
[1:03:11] kinds of spirit.
[1:03:13] Thank God that we have a scripture that
[1:03:16] I can identify. Amen. That will not
[1:03:18] bother us. Oh, praise God. That is the
[1:03:20] spirit of the last day. That's normal
[1:03:22] for them. But we have the spirit also in
[1:03:25] our heart. For these sort are they which
[1:03:27] creep into houses and lead captive seal
[1:03:31] women. Women led with sins led away with
[1:03:34] diverse lust. So it is about warning
[1:03:36] against those who manipulate weak willed
[1:03:40] individuals with their deceptive
[1:03:42] teaching leading them away from the
[1:03:44] truth and preventing them from truly
[1:03:46] understanding and embracing the gospel
[1:03:50] message.
[1:03:52] Hallelujah.
[1:03:54] Ever learning and ever able to come to
[1:03:56] the knowledge of truth. The truth of
[1:03:58] what? the truth of what God has said in
[1:04:01] this age through his messenger and the
[1:04:03] prophet to the Gentiles. Amen. So
[1:04:07] without the prophet, praise God, you can
[1:04:10] never understand the secret things.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Because the message of the hour is not
[1:04:16] about Malachi 4 or Revelation 10:7. They
[1:04:21] were scripture that was being
[1:04:24] vindicated in our faith. And this
[1:04:27] scripture point us to Christ.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; And even the godhead is not the message
[1:04:34] of the hour.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; The serpent seed was not the message of
[1:04:38] the hour.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Justification was not the message of the
[1:04:42] hour.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; But they were mystery truth that was
[1:04:45] being revealed in our day.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The message of the hour is
[1:04:50] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:04:53] It was Christ in you, the Holy Ghost,
[1:04:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which
[1:04:57] brings new birth to our lives.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; That is the message of the hour.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; And in Revelation 4:1,
[1:05:07] and after this I looked, and behold, the
[1:05:09] door was opened in heaven.
[1:05:12] And the first voice which I heard was as
[1:05:14] it were a trumpet talking with me, said,
[1:05:18] "Come up hi here, and I shook things
[1:05:20] which must be hereafter.
[1:05:22] So John, we know and understand that.
[1:05:24] Praise God. We are already convinced it
[1:05:26] that John was a type of the bride and we
[1:05:29] are already being caught up, praise God,
[1:05:31] into an open door which is in heaven.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, the message that we
[1:05:36] receive is not hallelujah. It's not
[1:05:39] about denominational understanding
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; but it was heavenly
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; message that we received
[1:05:49] and
[1:05:52] also in Ezekiel chapter one we know that
[1:05:54] the old testament was the shadow of
[1:05:58] uh uh uh old testament is a shadow of
[1:06:02] the new.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if Daniel was caught up, there
[1:06:06] was already a prophet in the Old
[1:06:09] Testament that was also caught up by
[1:06:12] vision. Ezekiel chapter 1. And now it
[1:06:16] came to pass in the 30th year in the
[1:06:18] fourth month in the fifth day of the
[1:06:20] month as I was among the captives by the
[1:06:22] river of Kevar that the heavens were
[1:06:25] opened and I saw visions of God.
[1:06:29] Parallel with Revelation chapter 4:1. So
[1:06:32] Ezekiel is captive in Babylon by this
[1:06:35] Babylonian river called Kibar. It is a
[1:06:39] perversions of the garden of Eden. It is
[1:06:42] a type of Satan's Eden.
[1:06:44] And he sees heaven open. And then
[1:06:47] Revelation 4, John saw heaven open.
[1:06:52] He was captive on the aisles of Patmos
[1:06:54] and he sees heaven open. And in this
[1:06:56] age, heaven is open to us while we are
[1:06:58] also exiled under captivity in Satan's
[1:07:01] caden.
[1:07:03] Hallelujah.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; So
[1:07:06] Babylon was very rich and increased with
[1:07:09] good. So all this event peril and speak
[1:07:11] of the same thing. So in revelation 10:8
[1:07:15] which is our scripture is the scripture
[1:07:17] that is being fulfilled to us. Amen.
[1:07:20] said, "And the voice which I heard from
[1:07:22] heaven spake unto me again
[1:07:25] and said, go and take the little book
[1:07:27] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:07:29] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:07:31] land." So there was a command to take
[1:07:33] the little book and we know that book
[1:07:35] has a word in itself. So a word
[1:07:38] hallelujah there is a word in a book. So
[1:07:41] if we take the book and eat it, we
[1:07:44] become the word.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:47] And I went unto the angel and said,
[1:07:49] "Give me the little book." And he said
[1:07:52] unto me, "Take it and eat it, and it
[1:07:54] shall make thy belly bitter, but it
[1:07:56] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey."
[1:07:59] And I took the little book out of the
[1:08:01] angel's hand, and ate it up, and it was
[1:08:03] in my mouth sweet as honey. As soon as I
[1:08:06] had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And
[1:08:09] he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[1:08:11] again before many people and many
[1:08:14] nations, and tongue again." Thou must
[1:08:15] prophesy again because the prophet these
[1:08:19] son of man praise God already prophesy
[1:08:22] and we are commanded to prophesy or
[1:08:24] preach the same message that the first
[1:08:27] angel was already preached.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:33] Thou must prophesy again.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Remember that brother Brham was a son of
[1:08:39] man. So he was revealing the son of man.
[1:08:43] This son of manifested himself in a son
[1:08:47] of man.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; And he give the message.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; But now that son of man didn't go
[1:08:53] anywhere else. That son of man was
[1:08:56] manifested now not only in a son but the
[1:09:00] sons.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. God was manifested in
[1:09:04] many members body and commanded that
[1:09:07] whatever
[1:09:09] this son of man
[1:09:11] preach you need to preach the same.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. First it was only by one
[1:09:18] man. One man who became first to mature
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; but now that son of man is in many sons
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; many membered body. So, we're preaching
[1:09:31] the same message
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; because the scripture said you need to
[1:09:34] preach it again.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Prophesy again. So, in Ezekiel chapter 2
[1:09:39] verse one,
[1:09:41] and he said unto me, son of man, stand
[1:09:43] upon thy feet, and I will speak unto
[1:09:45] thee. And the spirit entered into me
[1:09:48] when he spake unto me and sat upon my
[1:09:50] feet, and I heard him that spake unto
[1:09:52] me, and he said unto me, son of man, I
[1:09:54] sent thee to the children of Israel. So,
[1:09:57] a prophet is always sent to the people
[1:09:58] of God. That's why in this our day that
[1:10:02] Elijah was sent to the people of God.
[1:10:04] Amen. Because they were they were
[1:10:06] representative from the presence of the
[1:10:08] Lord. And he said, "And son of man, I
[1:10:11] send thee to the children of Israel to
[1:10:13] be to a rebellious nation that had
[1:10:16] rebelled against me, and they and they
[1:10:18] and their father have transgressed
[1:10:20] against me even unto this very day." And
[1:10:24] they are impudent,
[1:10:27] not showing respect. the same spirit
[1:10:31] and children
[1:10:33] stiffhearted or proud and stubborn. This
[1:10:35] is a lavishian spirit that is upon this
[1:10:37] people the same as what is in the people
[1:10:40] in this age. This scripture are
[1:10:42] paralleling the age that we are living
[1:10:44] in today.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; I do send unto thee and I do send thee
[1:10:49] unto them. God is sending them a prophet
[1:10:51] just as he has done in our age. And thou
[1:10:54] shalt say unto them, thus said the Lord,
[1:10:57] and they, whether they will hear, or
[1:10:59] whether they will pervail, for they are
[1:11:02] rebellious houses, yet shall know that
[1:11:04] there had been a prophet among them.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; And thou, son of man, be not afraid of
[1:11:10] them, neither be afraid of their words.
[1:11:13] So that's why God was sending the
[1:11:15] prophet without fear or favor.
[1:11:19] And he said, "Though son of man, be not
[1:11:21] afraid of them, and neither be afraid of
[1:11:23] their words, though Brian and turns be
[1:11:26] with thee, and thou dost dwell among
[1:11:28] scorpion. Be not afraid of their words,
[1:11:31] nor be dismayed at their looks, though
[1:11:34] they may be rebellious house. Don't fold
[1:11:37] under the pressure of how evil this age
[1:11:41] has become."
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:43] And thou shalt speak my word unto them
[1:11:45] whether they will hear or whether they
[1:11:48] forbear for they are most rebellious.
[1:11:51] Rebellion against God is the result of a
[1:11:53] fallen nature. And fallen nature is
[1:11:56] what?
[1:11:58] Praise God. It was separate us from the
[1:12:02] presence of the Lord.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And be thou son of man, hear what
[1:12:09] I say unto thee. Be thou rebil uh but
[1:12:12] thou son of man hear what I say unto
[1:12:14] thee. Be not thou rebellious like that
[1:12:17] rebellious house. Open thy mouth and eat
[1:12:19] that I give unto thee. And when I
[1:12:21] looked, behold, in hand was sent unto
[1:12:23] me, and lo, a roll of book was therein,
[1:12:27] and he spread it before me, and it was
[1:12:30] written within and without. And there
[1:12:32] was written therein lamentations, woe,
[1:12:35] and mourn lamentation, morning and wo.
[1:12:38] This is like like the open book. There
[1:12:40] is a written
[1:12:42] and unwritten
[1:12:44] inside.
[1:12:46] So in Ezekiel chapter 3, the parallel
[1:12:49] revelation chapter 8, moreover, he said
[1:12:53] unto me, son of man, eat that thou
[1:12:55] findest eat this role, and go speak unto
[1:12:58] the house of Israel.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; So I opened my mouth, and he caused me
[1:13:02] to eat that roll. And he said unto me,
[1:13:05] son of man, cause thy belly to eat until
[1:13:07] thy bowels with this roll that I give
[1:13:09] thee. Then did I eat it, and it was in
[1:13:12] my mouth as honey for sweetness. And he
[1:13:16] said unto me, son of man, go get thee
[1:13:18] unto the house of Israel, and speak with
[1:13:21] my words unto them. That is exactly
[1:13:24] parallel with Revelation 108-11
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; of the ministry of the bride in this
[1:13:29] hour. So if we read on Ezekiel, we find
[1:13:32] that what followed the eating of the
[1:13:34] skull is an economic squeeze
[1:13:38] showing us that after the bride has
[1:13:40] eaten the seven seal scroll of the
[1:13:42] message of this hour, we know then that
[1:13:44] the monetary system is going to come
[1:13:46] under pressure and cause an economic
[1:13:49] squeeze.
[1:13:53] I don't know if you are reading the news
[1:13:56] lately,
[1:13:58] there is always a squeezing of econ
[1:14:00] economic.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a lot of big companies are
[1:14:05] layoffing their employees by thousands
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; and they said this is the first time in
[1:14:11] US history that 150,000s
[1:14:15] jobs are being cut off.
[1:14:20] In Ezekiel 6:1, thus said the Lord God,
[1:14:23] smite with thine hand, and stamp with
[1:14:26] thy foot. So after he eating and
[1:14:28] prophesy, praise God, there was a
[1:14:29] judgment strike.
[1:14:33] And thou said the Lord, smite thine hand
[1:14:35] and stump with thy foot and say, Alas,
[1:14:38] for all the evil abominations of the
[1:14:40] house of Israel, for they shall fall by
[1:14:42] the sword.
[1:14:44] And it's as a military power.
[1:14:47] We can see it now. There's trouble.
[1:14:49] There is the extension in the land
[1:14:51] because of the ice.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; We just don't know how large the extent
[1:14:57] will be.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it creates tension.
[1:15:02] It speaks of military power. They will
[1:15:04] pour with the sword and by the famine
[1:15:06] that is an economic siege.
[1:15:10] Food sanctions against other nation.
[1:15:13] And we know that food
[1:15:16] can be used as a weapon.
[1:15:20] That's why sometime we realize oh the
[1:15:22] last few the last few months there was a
[1:15:25] shortage of egg and every every
[1:15:28] everything in the grocery are just
[1:15:30] coming up because of the tariff
[1:15:32] assumption everything that's going on.
[1:15:35] There is something happening
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; in this generation
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; and the scripture is falling in in
[1:15:41] place.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; This is not just a coincidence that is
[1:15:45] happening around us. It is scripture
[1:15:48] being fulfilled. It's just like a ple
[1:15:51] one ple here then one ple here then one
[1:15:54] pleel here. It's creating a picture.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; How do you get a dog to do what you
[1:16:05] want?
[1:16:07] You use food as to tool to bring that
[1:16:10] dog under your control and make it
[1:16:12] obedient.
[1:16:13] That is what the government is doing.
[1:16:16] have straight famine. Everything is
[1:16:18] higher up. No works and everything.
[1:16:21] Hallelujah.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; But praise God. It's not for us.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; We have a rapture. We have a catching
[1:16:28] away to look up.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; But for this word, it is just this is
[1:16:33] not the end yet, but the beginning of
[1:16:36] sorrow.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we are uh we are given a
[1:16:42] word when we see all these things look
[1:16:44] up for our redemption is draw at night.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; We need to be excited every moment that
[1:16:48] it happened. We need to be excited. We
[1:16:51] need to have a great expectation
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; because expectations will create or will
[1:16:56] influence our life will influence our
[1:16:58] thinking will influence the way we walk
[1:17:00] because we are in expectation of the
[1:17:03] soon coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:05] which is the changing of our body. Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; If we are in great expectation, then we
[1:17:09] need we need our expectations must must
[1:17:12] influence the way we think.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Not think about our career, not think
[1:17:17] about this word. We need to think, we
[1:17:19] need to pray. We need to Lord give me
[1:17:21] more sincerity in my walk with you Lord.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; I know all these things is happening is
[1:17:26] not by accident, but it is a a red red
[1:17:29] flag alert for each and every one of us.
[1:17:32] It is a warning sign.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That we need to dedicate ourselves. We
[1:17:36] need to grow more. Amen. We need to We
[1:17:39] We don't have time for this word
[1:17:41] anymore.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us, Lord.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Anywhere you turn here, anywhere you
[1:17:48] turn, it's always passes
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; a warning that our time is too short.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; By the famine and by the pistin and
[1:18:03] pistin is some diseases. You see the
[1:18:05] covid the ebola salmonella that is being
[1:18:08] produced now even our simple food are
[1:18:10] are contaminated with salmonella or
[1:18:13] ebola or age or covid.
[1:18:16] This is what is being happened happening
[1:18:20] now is just the result after the bride
[1:18:22] is speaking the word of god. Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; He that is far off shall die of
[1:18:30] pestilene and he that is near shall fall
[1:18:32] by the sword and he that remainth and is
[1:18:34] besieged shall die by the famine. Thus
[1:18:37] will I accomplish my fury upon them. So
[1:18:41] we have a clear picture in the book of
[1:18:43] Ezekiel. But in the book of Revelation,
[1:18:45] it said, "And I looked, and behold, a
[1:18:47] pale horse, and his name that sat on him
[1:18:49] was death, and hell follow him, and
[1:18:52] power was given unto
[1:18:55] unto them over the fourth part of there
[1:18:57] to kill with a sword,
[1:19:00] and with hunger, with famine, and with
[1:19:04] death, and with the beast of the earth."
[1:19:07] We may not know it. Praise God. But the
[1:19:10] effect of the judgment
[1:19:13] They can feel the word is already
[1:19:15] feeling it.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They say, "Oh, there's storm
[1:19:21] here. There's flooding here everywhere.
[1:19:23] Not only in the Philippines, Southeast
[1:19:25] Asia, Europe, everything." And they
[1:19:27] said, "Oh, it's a climate change."
[1:19:30] That's the only thing they can suggest.
[1:19:32] But for the bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:19:34] praise God. The earth is groaning for
[1:19:36] the manifestation of the sons and
[1:19:38] daughters of God. They are groaning.
[1:19:40] They are shouting, "Come on, sons.
[1:19:42] common sense. Amen. It's time to
[1:19:44] manifest. It's time to recognize your
[1:19:46] position. It's time that you claim what
[1:19:48] your position.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; It's time to washi. It's not time to go
[1:19:54] playing church.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; It's time to be serious.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; So this is the hour of vengeance.
[1:20:06] Hallelujah.
[1:20:08] This is showing
[1:20:10] what is to follow a people that have
[1:20:12] eaten to a book in this hour. This is
[1:20:15] showing us that what liai will come to
[1:20:17] after they have heard the final voice
[1:20:20] that is in the bride. The final voice to
[1:20:22] this word is the bride proclaiming the
[1:20:25] same revelation as the messenger to this
[1:20:28] generation in a matured form.
[1:20:32] Because the bride is not judgmental.
[1:20:35] We are not legalist. We just show the
[1:20:37] grace of God in these last days. And we
[1:20:39] know that if they are the bride of Jesus
[1:20:41] Christ, they will receive the same
[1:20:43] message that we receive.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; But if they don't receive the message of
[1:20:47] the hour is not our obligation to judge
[1:20:49] them because they don't receive the
[1:20:51] message.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; We just preach the gospel and it is
[1:20:54] God's obligation to quicken. If they are
[1:20:56] seed of God, praise God. IT WAS GOD'S
[1:20:58] OBLIGATION TO quicken because he already
[1:21:01] released an anointing to quicken that
[1:21:03] seed. In none seed, there's nothing to
[1:21:06] be quickened.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; We can be reborn because we are already
[1:21:09] seed. That's why if you are a seed of
[1:21:11] God in this last days, expect that you
[1:21:13] will receive and be born again in this
[1:21:15] last day.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; He love to say in dark ages the word was
[1:21:20] almost entirely lost to the people.
[1:21:24] But God sent Luther with a word. You
[1:21:28] just don't send messenger without the
[1:21:29] word. He sent Luther with the word. And
[1:21:31] Lutheran spoke for that God at that
[1:21:34] time. But they organized and again the
[1:21:36] pure word was lost for the organization
[1:21:39] stance toward dogmats and creeds and not
[1:21:42] simple word
[1:21:46] and not simple word.
[1:21:48] They complicate
[1:21:50] just like in our day they complicate the
[1:21:53] message of the hour. Right?
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; When God revealed himself, he always
[1:21:57] reveal it in simplicity that even the
[1:21:59] common people understood him.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; They could no longer speak for God. Then
[1:22:07] God sent Wesley and he was the voice
[1:22:10] with the word in his day. The people who
[1:22:13] took his revelations from God became the
[1:22:16] living
[1:22:18] and all known of all men for their
[1:22:21] generations. When the method is failed,
[1:22:23] God raised up others. And so it has gone
[1:22:26] on through the years until this last
[1:22:28] day.
[1:22:30] Do you believe that we are in the last
[1:22:31] days?
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; There is again another people in the
[1:22:36] land. Who under the messenger will be
[1:22:38] the final voice to the final age.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; We are the people of that land. We
[1:22:44] receive, praise God, the messenger, the
[1:22:46] message of the messenger and we become
[1:22:48] the final voice under our messenger.
[1:22:51] Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; There are many weapons of mass
[1:22:54] destruction in this age.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Famine is used as weapon of mass
[1:22:58] destruction. Deception is used as weapon
[1:23:01] of mass destruction in the natural and
[1:23:03] in the spiritual realm. When Eve was
[1:23:06] deceived by the serpent, it caused the
[1:23:08] mass destruction of the entire human
[1:23:12] race
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; for almost 6,000 years.
[1:23:16] This weapon of much deception as fake
[1:23:19] news, fake religion, fake entertainment,
[1:23:23] fake AI,
[1:23:25] artificial intelligent.
[1:23:29] Hallelujah.
[1:23:30] Then there are weapons of mass
[1:23:32] destruction like the pawn and the
[1:23:34] internet, Netflix, YouTube, Facebook,
[1:23:36] Twitter. Yes. All of that.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Each and every one of us have account
[1:23:41] maybe one or two.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] So it's not called the internet
[1:23:49] or worldwide web for nothing.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; It is a net that is designed to trap its
[1:23:57] prey.
[1:23:59] Almost all praise God the world is being
[1:24:01] trapped
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; through the internet. They spend more
[1:24:04] time in the social media than the word
[1:24:06] of God.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:24:11] the word of God is good.
[1:24:13] You need to go back to the word of God.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; We need to pray. We know that by the
[1:24:19] message we are now living in Satan's
[1:24:20] Eden. And the character of this Satan's
[1:24:23] Eden is not good.
[1:24:26] The gold of this Satan Eden is not good.
[1:24:28] But the gold of the original Eden is
[1:24:30] good. Praise God. So in the message
[1:24:35] age, buy of me gold
[1:24:38] tried in fire that you may be rich.
[1:24:41] Yeah.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Now these people had plenty of gold, but
[1:24:45] it was the wrong kind. It was that gold
[1:24:47] that brought men's life and destroyed
[1:24:50] them. It was the gold that rupt and
[1:24:53] twisted human character. For it's the
[1:24:55] love of money that was the root of all
[1:24:59] evil.
[1:25:01] In paragraph 51, you better come before
[1:25:03] it's too late. So he was addressing a
[1:25:06] believer. You need to come before it's
[1:25:08] too late, thus said the Lord. and buy me
[1:25:11] gold tried in the fire
[1:25:14] and then you will be truly rich.
[1:25:18] Are we getting it? Listen to me. Naked
[1:25:20] physically we come into this word but
[1:25:22] naked spirit we will not live.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; We come naked but we will go back
[1:25:29] spiritually not naked we will be dressed
[1:25:31] by the word of God in this last day.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:34] Oh no, we are going to take something
[1:25:37] with us and what that something is all
[1:25:40] we can take with us.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; We need to take something and all that
[1:25:43] something is all we did. All we can take
[1:25:47] with nothing less, nothing more. So we
[1:25:49] had better be real careful now to see
[1:25:51] that we take something that will make us
[1:25:55] right before God.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; So then what will we take with us? We
[1:26:01] will take our character, brother. Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Because power aside from character,
[1:26:06] praise God, is just satanic. We will
[1:26:09] bring our character, not this character
[1:26:11] of the flesh, but the character of
[1:26:13] Christ, which is the word in us being
[1:26:15] quickened. So that's why WE CAN DISPLAY.
[1:26:17] THAT'S THE ONLY THING that we can bring
[1:26:19] us.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Because we need to recognize who we are.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; That is what we will take with us. Now,
[1:26:28] what kind of character will you take
[1:26:30] with you?
[1:26:34] So it's question asking question
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; right
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; we will take our carter brother but that
[1:26:42] is what we will take with us but what
[1:26:45] kind of character will you take with you
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; still a question
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; even though you are already in the
[1:26:52] message although you are already
[1:26:54] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; but we know that not everybody express
[1:27:00] or surrender everything unto the Lord
[1:27:03] They just being justified. They are
[1:27:05] being just sanctified and that's it.
[1:27:07] They don't want to go all the way,
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And they still have their own way.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; But the Lord Jesus Christ said, "I am
[1:27:15] the way. I am the only way.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; If you want to go, if you want to have
[1:27:20] life, you need to go to me. Come unto me
[1:27:25] that way heaven. I will give you rest,
[1:27:27] spiritual rest. I am the way." Yes.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; And people wants to go serve God but not
[1:27:35] all the way.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Just like Cain, he wants to go what? But
[1:27:40] not all the way because he wants to do
[1:27:42] it his way.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; The queen Vastly when the king invited
[1:27:46] her for a celebration of marriage, he do
[1:27:49] it his way.
[1:27:53] Even Ammon was commanded to to be to to
[1:27:57] clean in the Jordan River. He he don't
[1:28:00] want to go he want to go his way
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; right
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; and a lot of Christian has dust
[1:28:04] character
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; they just want to be seen in the church
[1:28:08] oh I am a believer I am this I am
[1:28:09] present every service I am but they
[1:28:11] don't want to go all the way
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; we don't want to bring our character our
[1:28:19] cracker is nothing
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; we are born in sin come to the world
[1:28:22] speaking lies praise God and we cannot
[1:28:25] this character will not please God we
[1:28:26] need to have the character of Christ in
[1:28:28] us.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we need to go all the way
[1:28:32] serving the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord,
[1:28:34] praise God. I cannot make it but help me
[1:28:36] Lord to humble myself and surrender
[1:28:38] everything
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; and fully trust you in all ways.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Because he said my ways are better than
[1:28:44] your ways and my thoughts are higher
[1:28:46] than your thought.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That is what we will take with us. Not
[1:28:52] what kind of car will you take with you.
[1:28:54] Will it be his whose will it be his
[1:28:57] whose character are molded by suffering
[1:28:59] in the fire and furnace of affliction
[1:29:02] or will it be the softness of this love
[1:29:05] characterless loudest young people? It's
[1:29:07] up to each of us for in that day every
[1:29:09] man will bear his own bar burden.
[1:29:13] Amen. The character that men fell from
[1:29:16] Eden is to come back into a people in
[1:29:19] this age. A character that can agree
[1:29:21] with every word of God. The same
[1:29:24] character in the beginning will be
[1:29:25] restored back in this generation. A
[1:29:28] character that will humble and receive
[1:29:30] every word of God in this generation.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; So the fullness of the w the word the
[1:29:35] character of Christ that is found in
[1:29:37] this land where this river of life flows
[1:29:39] is good. It is to be the dity again in
[1:29:41] human flesh.
[1:29:46] So last few quotes
[1:29:50] in the message Christ is the as I say a
[1:29:52] while ago that the message
[1:29:56] is not Malachi 4. The message is not
[1:29:59] revelation 10:7. The message is not
[1:30:02] about brother Brham. It's not even about
[1:30:04] the godhead
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; but it was the truth being revealed to
[1:30:08] us.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; We have no understanding of the godhead
[1:30:11] that there's only one god not three
[1:30:13] gods. We have the truth being revealed.
[1:30:15] The serpent seed, but the serpent seed
[1:30:17] was not the message of the hour.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; The serpent seed is a hidden truth
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; that was revealed in our day that the
[1:30:25] original sin is not by eating an apple
[1:30:27] and we know the story about that.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery of grace, it was not
[1:30:32] the message of the hour, but the message
[1:30:34] of the hour, praise God, is to let you
[1:30:37] know who you are. Because in John 14:20
[1:30:40] said at that day you will know
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; that I have in the father ye in me and I
[1:30:47] in you. What day was that? This is the
[1:30:50] day as the prophet said. Now
[1:30:54] notice God making himself known.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; God is making himself known. We're not
[1:31:01] supposed to make converts to
[1:31:03] Christianity by government, but by the
[1:31:06] revelation of Christ in you as God was
[1:31:09] in Christ.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need converted by the
[1:31:13] revelation. So it is a personal praise
[1:31:16] God. It's a personal affair with Jesus
[1:31:18] Christ.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Even when he was blessing, ask everybody
[1:31:22] who do you say I am?
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And some say you are Jeremiah. Some say
[1:31:27] you are Elijah. Some say praise God.
[1:31:30] Maybe you are a good prophet.
[1:31:33] Everybody has own views,
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; But they asked Peter, "How about you
[1:31:39] Peter?
[1:31:41] Who am I to you? What is your revelation
[1:31:44] regarding me?"
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou art the Christ, the son
[1:31:48] of the living God."
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the Lord blessed thou
[1:31:53] thou Simon Peter
[1:31:56] because of this revelation. It was not
[1:31:58] me that gave you the revelation but it
[1:32:01] was the father that gave you the
[1:32:03] revelation.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; So it's not even Christ who gave the
[1:32:07] revelation. It was the father who gave
[1:32:09] you the revelation which is type of THE
[1:32:11] HOLY GHOST THAT will give the revelation
[1:32:13] to each and every one of us.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you get the
[1:32:17] revelation, he said, "Upon this rock, I
[1:32:19] will build my church
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:32:23] against it." So it takes revelation
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; of who Christ was in your life.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; God was in Christ. As God was in Christ,
[1:32:36] Christ in you. When God did in Christ,
[1:32:39] Christ does in you. What sign did God
[1:32:41] did in Christ?
[1:32:44] What sign did Christ did in Christ? He
[1:32:47] said as the son of man, as a son of God,
[1:32:50] he said the son can do nothing within
[1:32:53] himself.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; The things that you see, the healing,
[1:32:57] the miracles, it was not I, but it was
[1:33:01] God
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; in me.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; So what God is doing in Christ, Christ
[1:33:08] now doing in you.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are now the body of
[1:33:11] Christ in earth.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; So what is our commission? Pray for the
[1:33:19] sick and they shall be healed.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; If they're beaten by the serpent, they
[1:33:24] shall be healed.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can do miracles by because you
[1:33:28] are already a commission of Christ. Just
[1:33:30] need to SHAKE YOURSELF THAT I am a son
[1:33:33] of God.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't need to. You don't
[1:33:36] need, as I always say, you don't need to
[1:33:38] look at your flesh.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Look at the promise that says about you.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Not the feeling, HOW NOT HOW YOU FEEL,
[1:33:49] HOW SOMEBODY SAYS ABOUT YOU, but what
[1:33:51] the word says about you.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Because we have the message of the hour
[1:33:56] and this message is directly pointing to
[1:33:59] each one of us.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. As God was in Christ,
[1:34:03] Christ in you. When God did in Christ,
[1:34:05] Christ dust in you. What sign did God in
[1:34:08] Christ, Christ does in you. Isn't that
[1:34:10] beautiful? Jesus at that day, he said
[1:34:14] John 14:12, that is our scripture that
[1:34:17] is being fulfilled. Jesus said at that
[1:34:20] day,
[1:34:22] what is that day? That day in the future
[1:34:24] and the prophet that day is this day.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. At that day when this revelation
[1:34:31] is made known,
[1:34:35] you will know
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; that I am in the father
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; and the father in me. I in you and you
[1:34:45] in me
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; at that day. And the prophet said this
[1:34:49] is the day.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That you need to know.
[1:34:55] You need to know.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:57] If you are sons and daughters God, you
[1:34:59] need to know your position. That is the
[1:35:01] message of the hour. You need to know.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; He said that I am in the father.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you in me.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You will know that I am in
[1:35:14] the father. You will know.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; There is no coming there. No one can
[1:35:20] hinder this because he has already. You
[1:35:23] will know and you need to know and you
[1:35:27] shall know.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:32] That I am in the father, the father in
[1:35:34] me, I in you and you in me. When the
[1:35:38] revelations made manifest.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. At that day you shall know
[1:35:44] that I and the father are one.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; I am in the father. The father is in me.
[1:35:52] Then when the revelation comes forth,
[1:35:54] then it's I in you and you in me. There
[1:35:58] you are. That is the message of the
[1:35:59] hour.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Knowing who YOU ARE, WHAT PART of the
[1:36:03] program of God there are you in?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is not about church
[1:36:07] membership. Because when the son of man
[1:36:09] cometh, shall he find faith? Shall he
[1:36:11] find revelation?
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; He will not ask for church membership.
[1:36:18] What affiliations you are in, how who
[1:36:20] how long you are in the message of the
[1:36:22] hour. When the sentiment cometh, shall
[1:36:24] he find faith, revelation of who you
[1:36:28] are, revelation of the day that you are
[1:36:30] living in
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; because I say at that day you shall
[1:36:34] know.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:41] When the revelation comes forth,
[1:36:45] then it's I
[1:36:47] in you
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; and you in me.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Remember when God created Adam, he
[1:36:53] created him male and female.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Eve was already part of Adam.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; So when Adam was manifest in the flesh,
[1:37:02] there was a secret mystery while he was
[1:37:05] walking. And we know all the stories
[1:37:08] praise God that Adam could not be
[1:37:10] complete without the manifestations of
[1:37:13] him.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Likewise in this last days, praise God,
[1:37:16] Christ will not be complete WITHOUT THE
[1:37:18] REVELATION OF BRIDE of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:20] That's why he say at that day
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; you will know that I am THE FATHER,
[1:37:25] FATHER ME, I in you and you in me.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; We are part of the program of God.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:34] In the message it is I. He said and it
[1:37:38] was in the days of Sodom. Are we living
[1:37:40] in the days of Sodom?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Not in Noah. Now remember he explained
[1:37:47] that by Sodom that this is the time of
[1:37:50] Sodom when the words going to be burned
[1:37:55] not drown.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; And sometimes people say maybe God is
[1:37:59] mistaken because a lot of people are
[1:38:01] being drowned by flood.
[1:38:03] But that's not it.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; That is just the beginning of sorrow.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; We know that the end will come.
[1:38:09] Hallelujah. We don't know. Maybe
[1:38:11] tomorrow, maybe next week. Praise God.
[1:38:13] But our time, Hallelujah, is too short.
[1:38:15] We see all the signs around that.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; We can no longer afford to play church.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Because our time, Hallelujah, the things
[1:38:25] that we see all around us speaks about
[1:38:27] the soon coming of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; We need to have faith.
[1:38:32] Hallelujah. That can fade that can
[1:38:34] change our mortal body into immortality
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; and only can give us strong is the
[1:38:39] revelation of who you are. Because the
[1:38:41] prophet said when he preached the Christ
[1:38:42] is the mystery of God. When the bride
[1:38:44] know who she is
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; then the rapture will go.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Because the rapture is already in
[1:38:50] progress. Amen. We know that.
[1:38:51] Hallelujah. We are we are already
[1:38:54] matured. Praise God. the message of the
[1:38:56] hour and we know that something is going
[1:38:58] wrong right now
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; because the rapture in three phases and
[1:39:02] we know that it happened THE SHOUT
[1:39:03] HAPPENED THE VOICE happened and we are
[1:39:05] looking for the last trump of God when
[1:39:07] the dead in Christ shall rise first and
[1:39:09] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:39:12] together with them to meet the Lord in
[1:39:14] the end
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; hallelujah it's going to be burned and
[1:39:18] this sign was to return not an ark but a
[1:39:22] god dwelling in the flesh of his people
[1:39:25] in his church.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; It will return again that God will
[1:39:29] manifest himself once again not only in
[1:39:32] one person brother but in many member
[1:39:36] church body.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; God is going to manifest himself.
[1:39:39] Hallelujah. You need to feel it. Amen.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's some sometimes uh uh
[1:39:47] mostly don't feel their reality
[1:39:51] because they are always
[1:39:53] looking at this flesh,
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; looking at troubles, looking at trials.
[1:39:58] We need to look at the promises of God.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because this is the exciting
[1:40:03] time.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:10] going to be born and the sign was to
[1:40:12] return not an ark but a god dwelling in
[1:40:15] the flesh of his people his church.
[1:40:20] Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Now God is in the flesh
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; fulfilling the prophet said that when
[1:40:25] Christ the mystery the three-fold
[1:40:27] purposes of God, God want to show
[1:40:29] himself. God was in Christ. Now Christ
[1:40:32] was in his many membered body.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Christ is the anointed word that was in
[1:40:37] you
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; because no one can receive this message
[1:40:40] except you are part of it.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; It's hard to receive if you have no part
[1:40:45] in it.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is the reality. You go
[1:40:48] outside. You go outside and show the
[1:40:51] message of the hour, not everybody will
[1:40:52] receive it. But they will ridicule you,
[1:40:56] say something bad about you. No more
[1:40:58] prophet. No more.
[1:41:00] But how about us? We just enjoy the
[1:41:03] message of the hour. Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; We just feel that there's something
[1:41:09] pulling us
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; because when the seal was open,
[1:41:13] hallelujah,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; the scripture said that when the seal
[1:41:16] was open, he gathered all his subject
[1:41:20] unto himself. And who is his subject?
[1:41:22] The bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we cannot run away from
[1:41:27] our calling. We are called the eternal
[1:41:30] church age. This place is not eternal
[1:41:33] but our eternal connection is from the
[1:41:36] foundation of the word.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; And one of these days we will return to
[1:41:40] that condition.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said at that day you will know
[1:41:47] that I am in the father the father in
[1:41:49] me. I in you and you in me. It's God in
[1:41:53] you.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Don't look for Jesus of Nazareth to be
[1:41:57] in you.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; God is in his word.
[1:42:02] It's the word of God that is being
[1:42:04] vindicated that was in you which is God
[1:42:07] in you. The word of Christ in you.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:42:15] And all Christ was, he poured into the
[1:42:18] church.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; So it's God above us in the Old
[1:42:21] Testament, God with us during the time
[1:42:23] of Jesus Christ. And God in us.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:30] No wonder we are commissioned to baptize
[1:42:32] using father, son and holy ghost. It's
[1:42:35] not three different gods, three offices
[1:42:38] of one god. See God above us in the
[1:42:40] father god in us with the son cleansing
[1:42:44] his way condescending
[1:42:46] coming down making a way for me to get
[1:42:50] back.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; OH THANK YOU LORD.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD CAME DOWN condescending
[1:42:54] making HIS WAY TO CALL YOU IN THESE LAST
[1:42:56] DAYS. This is your day. Amen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE REVELATION MIGHTY THE
[1:43:01] MIGHTY ANGEL COMING OUT HE FIND his way
[1:43:03] condescending to bring you back unto
[1:43:06] himself.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; All that God was he poured into Christ
[1:43:11] and all that Christ was he poured into
[1:43:14] us. So it's God above us, God with us
[1:43:16] and God in us. No wonder we are
[1:43:18] commissioned to baptize using father,
[1:43:19] son and holy ghost. It's not three gods.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; It's one God in three offices. That is
[1:43:24] the truth that being being revealed in
[1:43:26] these last days.
[1:43:29] Hallelujah. God above us in the father
[1:43:31] god in us with the son cleansing his way
[1:43:33] condescending coming down making a way
[1:43:36] for me to get back.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; And bring his people back to
[1:43:40] manifestations of sons of God like they
[1:43:43] had in the garden of Eden.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; The third full purposes third full
[1:43:50] purpose of his coming.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. and bring his people
[1:43:54] back to manifested sense like they had
[1:43:56] them in the garden of Ed. The whole
[1:43:58] world's groaning.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; The whole world is groaning
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; and waiting for that hour for the
[1:44:06] manifestations of sons of God.
[1:44:09] Hallelujah. They are groaning and they
[1:44:11] say, "Oh, there's there's there's
[1:44:13] something a climate change."
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. That is a climate change
[1:44:18] they call it
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; because that's the only way that they
[1:44:22] can explain it a climate change
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; but the scripture said the earth is
[1:44:26] groaning.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is groaning to be changed
[1:44:31] so that the sons and daughters of God
[1:44:32] can live in the millennium with peace
[1:44:35] without
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; without trouble without hurtaches
[1:44:39] without anything.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:44:43] coming down making a way and bring his
[1:44:45] people back to manifested sons like they
[1:44:47] had in the garden of it. The whole world
[1:44:49] is groaning and waiting for that hour
[1:44:51] for the manifestation of the son of God.
[1:44:56] Take note. He has no voice tonight
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; but yours.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; He has no hand but our hands.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; He has your hands that whose hand it is.
[1:45:10] He said, "I am the vine and you are the
[1:45:13] branches."
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; I hope that you listen to this poor
[1:45:17] voice tonight
[1:45:19] and the little still small voice of the
[1:45:22] spirit God speak into your heart.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; We are not only hearing the voice
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; of brother Brham, but we are hearing the
[1:45:30] still small voice that can penetrate
[1:45:33] into our heart.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:45:37] forever.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I'm calling our musicians
[1:45:41] to come. I am the vine and you are the
[1:45:43] Brunson. I hope that you'll listen to
[1:45:45] this poor voice tonight and the little
[1:45:48] still small voice of the spirit that can
[1:45:51] speak into your heart and hear him say
[1:45:54] it is I.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Be not afraid.
