[32:35] yeah praise the Lord a few announcements
[32:39] here before we get started um did
[32:42] everybody see the the Rocks where the
[32:46] Rocks used to be here in the front of
[32:47] the church the rocks are no longer there
[32:50] and it's dirt and there's a big caution
[32:52] tape that's around the dirt you know
[32:54] what the caution tape
[32:56] means it means do not enter and when we
[32:59] pulled up the this evening uh I saw me
[33:02] and my wife we both looked at each other
[33:04] at the same time uhoh
[33:08] boys so uh you know families with young
[33:12] kids and everything I don't think we
[33:14] have to worry about the elderly playing
[33:16] in the dirt but uh you know families
[33:18] with young kids let's do our best uh
[33:22] first time obedience stay out of the
[33:24] dirt am and uh I believe what's
[33:27] happening is they're putting artificial
[33:29] turf in there and they're going to put a
[33:31] nice fence around it and um that's going
[33:34] to be a place for the kids to play on
[33:37] Sundays and stuff it's going to be very
[33:39] nice um also on Friday we have the
[33:45] memorial service for brother Gustavo
[33:47] Aila it's here at the church at 9:00
[33:50] a.m. um so if you're available to come
[33:53] I'm sure the family would greatly
[33:55] appreciate that and of course uh let's
[33:59] continue to pray for brother Ron brother
[34:01] Ron as you all know has been admitted
[34:03] back into the hospital again and uh you
[34:06] know I'm sure the doctors and nurses
[34:08] there are doing their best to take care
[34:10] of brother Ron but he needs a a special
[34:12] touch and um and he has requested that
[34:16] that that he has no visitors um I don't
[34:19] even personally know what what hospital

[34:41] go to bed tonight you'll raise your hand
[34:43] and you'll say I'll pray for my pastor
[34:45] amen yeah because guess what your pastor
[34:47] has prayed for all of you and so now
[34:50] it's our turn now it's our turn to
[34:53] intercede for brother Ron amen amen
[34:56] godess bless you turn with me in your
[34:58] Bible to the Book of John chapter
[35:06] 1 I just have a simple thought here this
[35:11] evening and I trust it'll be a blessing
[35:14] to
[35:15] you John chap 1 and we'll read verses
[35:20] 1-5 in the beginning was the word and
[35:24] the Word was with God and the word was
[35:27] God Amen the same was in the beginning
[35:30] with God all things were made by him and
[35:33] without him was not anything made that
[35:35] was made in him was life and the life
[35:39] was the light of man and the light
[35:41] shineth in darkness and the Darkness
[35:45] comprehended it not amen uh verse
[35:50] 14 of the same chapter in the same book
[35:53] and it says and the Word was made flesh
[35:56] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[36:00] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[36:03] father full of grace and truth amen you
[36:06] may be seated this
[36:09] evening I would like to take for a
[36:13] titled this
[36:14] evening the
[36:16] word and we read in our Bibles there
[36:19] that in the beginning was the word and
[36:22] the Word was with God and the Word was
[36:24] God and this same word we know was made
[36:29] flesh and it dwelt amongst us and it's
[36:33] kind of interesting whenever you begin
[36:36] to think of the word uh it's the most
[36:41] simplistic uh but yet a subject that is
[36:45] so deep and vast how do you begin to
[36:49] explain it right and so I trust that
[36:52] with God's help that he'll be able to
[36:54] help us this evening because God is
[36:57] known in Simplicity amen now when we
[37:01] talk about the word uh what does it
[37:04] really mean for us as Believers when we
[37:08] talk about the word or when we refer to
[37:12] the word is the word different than God
[37:17] is the word different than Jesus Christ
[37:21] and what does it mean to us as Believers
[37:25] when we talk about the word because
[37:28] we're always talking about the word and
[37:31] the ministry will get up and we'll talk
[37:33] about the word and we'll talk about the
[37:36] Bible and and really to us as
[37:39] individuals it is important for us to
[37:41] know what the word is it's important for
[37:45] us to know what the word was sent to
[37:48] accomplish and when we realize what the
[37:52] word is and who the word is it will give
[37:56] us a different Outlook upon the
[38:02] word because when we realize that the
[38:05] word our Bible as we know it it is not
[38:08] just a book uh like a novel or like a
[38:11] newspaper but it is something that is
[38:14] extremely
[38:16] Supernatural and so because it is a
[38:19] supernatural book it doesn't always just
[38:22] necessarily deal with our natural man
[38:25] but it deals with us as supernatural
[38:28] beings and so that's why it's important
[38:30] for us to realize our place within the
[38:35] word amen amen
[38:38] so uh like I said it's a very simple yet
[38:43] it's a complex subject to speak upon
[38:48] and because this word that we believe is
[38:52] a word that is eternal it is a word that
[38:56] was its author is a uh an infinite being
[39:01] and so how can we uh people who are
[39:04] finite in our thinking and carnal in our
[39:07] ways how can we begin to understand such
[39:12] a book of um uh that has been written by
[39:16] an infinite Eternal being how can a
[39:19] creature that has been born in time such
[39:23] as you and I how can we understand uh
[39:26] Eternal book and an eternal author
[39:29] there's only one way to understand this
[39:32] book there's only one way to understand
[39:35] its author and that's by the baptism of
[39:37] the Holy Ghost and so I'm praying this
[39:40] evening that that we as individuals and
[39:43] as a body that we take it into our into
[39:46] our hearts and into our lives and say
[39:48] father I want revelation I want
[39:52] revelation of your word that goes beyond
[39:55] my carnal
[39:57] understanding that goes beyond my carnal
[39:59] reasoning and the knowledge that I might
[40:01] be able to attain by just reading this
[40:04] book but father give me the Revelation
[40:07] to where I can read between the lines to
[40:10] where I can see the picture that lays
[40:13] within the picture because with our
[40:16] understanding as a man or as a woman or
[40:18] a boy or a girl we can get a a grasp of
[40:21] this
[40:22] book upon the top of it right
[40:26] we can we can get we can skim a stone
[40:29] you ever skim a stone at the water at
[40:31] the lake or wh youever you are and you
[40:32] skim and it
[40:33] goes yeah I got five skips and I got 10
[40:37] skips and you know the secret to Stone
[40:39] skipping is get a smooth Rock get the
[40:42] rock that's the smoothest and that has
[40:44] the the the flattest bottom to it but we
[40:47] don't want to be just rock skimmers with
[40:49] the word of God but we want to go deep
[40:51] into the word of God and there's only
[40:54] one way to go deep into the word of God
[40:56] God that's by Supernatural Revelation
[40:59] that's given by God
[41:01] [Applause]
[41:02] himself I know one thing for sure in my
[41:05] own life and and I know that you can
[41:08] agree with me because you're here
[41:09] tonight because we all have the same
[41:12] desire and that's we're wanting a closer
[41:14] walk with God we're wanting to make the
[41:17] Rapture why else would we uh set aside
[41:20] our cares of life on a Wednesday night
[41:23] to come to church when it's difficult
[41:26] come to church on a Wednesday night it's
[41:29] difficult when you live on the other
[41:30] side of town and you have to make a
[41:32] sacrifice to come but the reason why you
[41:35] do it is because you're longing for more
[41:38] of God it's not just a ritual it's not
[41:41] just something you're doing otherwise
[41:44] when life got too hard you wouldn't come
[41:46] so I command you all this evening that
[41:49] you're here and that you're wanting to
[41:51] hear from God and I know that if there's
[41:54] more of God that were desire iring
[41:56] there's more of God that he wants to
[41:58] pour out in our lives and so I'm asking
[42:02] father Meet The Desires in the longings
[42:05] of our
[42:07] hearts and make yourself
[42:12] known Hallelujah now when brother
[42:16] Brenham talks about God it's very
[42:19] interesting he he says that even before
[42:23] God was God he dwelt alone in his
[42:26] thoughts here he was the self-existing
[42:30] one brother brandham says it's Elohim
[42:34] and here he was before there was
[42:36] Stardust before there was any kind of
[42:39] creation here was God by himself in a
[42:43] vast of
[42:45] nothingness but there he dwelt alone
[42:48] with his thoughts and brother brandom he
[42:51] he uses this this this analogy and I
[42:54] love it so much cuz I can picture in my
[42:56] mind when he's describing it he says
[42:59] here God was alone and he's Des Desiring
[43:04] fellowship and so all of a sudden
[43:06] there's a little Halo of light that
[43:09] appears brother brandham said that that
[43:12] is the logos of God Amen and so when we
[43:15] begin to think of the logos of God we
[43:19] look it up within within Strong's
[43:21] Concordance and it's the the concept are
[43:24] the very thought of God
[43:27] himself it is not a different entity it
[43:31] is not a different person it is not a
[43:34] different Spirit but it it is an
[43:36] attribute of God himself that came out
[43:40] of God now it's it's so wonderful when
[43:43] you begin to watch the
[43:45] condensating of
[43:48] God yes I don't want to jump ahead of
[43:50] myself but it's a beautiful thing
[43:52] because there's a reason why God begins
[43:55] to condensate understand from what he
[43:57] was in this vast of nothingness alone
[44:00] with his thoughts to where he wanted to
[44:02] get to because he has a journey in his
[44:06] mind he has this great drama in his mind
[44:09] that he's wanting to
[44:13] unfold and you're all saying amen
[44:15] because you know you're part of it you
[44:17] know you're part of the journey you know
[44:19] you're part of the Great drama of
[44:22] God
[44:24] hallelujah and so we see that this great
[44:26] logos of God it was God himself and God
[44:30] had a purpose within his heart he wanted
[44:32] to make himself
[44:38] snn in the sermon the resurrection of
[44:41] Lazarus 1951 brother brandham said let's
[44:45] just picture that as being a a white
[44:47] Halo coming out of that space that was
[44:51] the Son of God the logos so what was
[44:55] this little Halo that that came out of
[44:57] this vast of nothingness it was the son
[45:00] of God it was the logos it was the very
[45:04] uh concept and thoughts of God that was
[45:08] now beginning to materialize
[45:12] itself
[45:14] Hallelujah and there it
[45:16] was in space moving around like a little
[45:20] child playing before the door of its
[45:23] parent and he draw in his mind what
[45:25] should be and I can hear him look around
[45:29] and say there was nothing anywhere just
[45:31] a vast of space the father covered all
[45:34] the space and then this and then this
[45:37] God became bized down to the lugos I can
[45:42] hear him say let there be light and an
[45:45] an Adam bursted Yonder and the sun came
[45:48] into existence deity she began to whirl
[45:52] millions of years rolled by and after a
[45:55] while a p a piece flew off of it there
[45:58] was a star now watch this this is the
[46:02] beginning of the creation of God here
[46:05] can you picture it in your mind yes amen
[46:08] here's the sun he saying let there be
[46:10] light there might have been millions of
[46:12] years that
[46:14] passed and all of a sudden here it is
[46:17] brother brandham said that God believed
[46:20] in his own
[46:22] word if God believed in his own word in
[46:25] order to bring get to pass there's only
[46:27] one thing for you and I to do as Sons
[46:29] and Daughters of God and that's to
[46:30] believe the word and if we believe the
[46:33] word by simple faith God will bring it
[46:36] to pass in our
[46:42] lives he says and he stood out there and
[46:44] watched it and it and and it went all
[46:47] down and he stopped it over here after a
[46:49] while it it fell a few million
[46:51] years off went another one he let it
[46:54] fall near a certain place and he stopped
[46:56] it what's he doing he's got in his mind
[46:59] now that somebody there will be on earth
[47:02] I wonder who that somebody would be
[47:04] there will be mankind on Earth God is
[47:07] from above he's writing the Zodiac in
[47:09] the sky zodiac starts with the Virgin
[47:12] the first coming of Christ ends up with
[47:14] Leo the Lion the second coming and he's
[47:16] writing his first Bible there's three of
[47:20] them and we all know what the three
[47:22] bibles are the first Bible is the Zodiac
[47:25] in the heaven
[47:26] the second Bible was the pyramids that
[47:28] Enoch built and the third Bible that we
[47:31] have is this one that we can read right
[47:33] here why because God is perfected in
[47:37] threes so he created the sun he created
[47:40] the stars and the moon and and God had a
[47:44] purpose for all those things in the
[47:46] natural because he knew that there would
[47:49] be people that would be dwelling here on
[47:52] planet Earth and so he made the son for
[47:55] a purpose purpose he made the moon for a
[47:57] purpose he made the stars and everything
[48:00] for a purpose that it would all run
[48:02] together so that this planet Earth would
[48:05] be
[48:06] livable come on so when the people of
[48:09] the earth when they look at the Moon
[48:11] what do they see they go wow look at
[48:15] that thing I wonder if we could land a
[48:18] man on the moon someday they look at the
[48:21] Moon and they say wow that thing is is
[48:24] so amazing just look at it look how it
[48:26] how it how it how it keeps the tide and
[48:29] the water from only going so far upon
[48:31] Earth and look how the the Moon is given
[48:34] for signs and for seasons and all these
[48:36] things and it absolutely captivates the
[48:39] mind of scientists and
[48:41] Mankind but when the believer looks at
[48:43] the moon the believer looks at the Moon
[48:45] just a little bit differently when we
[48:48] look at the Moon we sure we can look at
[48:50] it in it's natural but we look at it
[48:52] spiritually and we say wow look at that
[48:55] thing it's a reflection of the sun when
[48:57] the sun isn't here just as the Bride is
[49:00] a reflection of the Son of God when he's
[49:03] been absent here on Earth and so though
[49:05] God gave it for a a
[49:08] multi-purpose he's hiding himself in
[49:11] plain
[49:13] view he's given the moon for people to
[49:16] look at but he's given it to the bride
[49:18] because he's telling his story he's
[49:21] unfolding his drama of this journey
[49:24] Hallelujah thank you Lord so what is the
[49:28] moon
[49:29] spiritually it is God writing his story
[49:34] writing his story but he's hiding it in
[49:37] plain
[49:38] view he's hiding it to the world and
[49:41] he's revealing it to babes such as we'
[49:44] learn look at the stars it's the exact
[49:47] same thing people make millions of
[49:50] dollars uh astronomers and things and
[49:53] they and they look at the stars and they
[49:55] look at at the galaxies and they can
[49:57] take their phone out and they can and
[49:59] they can put their phone up against the
[50:01] stars and they can say oh wow wow
[50:04] there's Orion's Belt wow there's this
[50:08] one and there's that one and they can
[50:10] put all these constellations together
[50:13] and it's such a a wonderful thing for
[50:15] mankind to look at but when the believer
[50:18] looks at the stars they look up and they
[50:20] say wow I see myself up there I see my
[50:25] representation up there in the sky why
[50:28] because he told Abraham that you're seed
[50:31] look at the
[50:32] stars look at them look at all of them
[50:34] that's what your seed is going to be so
[50:37] when the believer looks at the stars
[50:39] they're not just looking at it naturally
[50:42] but they're looking at the plan of God
[50:44] Amen from the Virgin to Leo the Lion and
[50:48] we say wow look at the plan of God that
[50:51] he has written within the skies how
[50:54] amazing is this
[50:56] what is it it is God hiding himself in
[50:59] plain view but he's revealing himself to
[51:02] babes such as would
[51:04] learn thank you
[51:06] Lord we could look at
[51:09] nature and people look at trees and they
[51:13] look at the grass they look at pretty
[51:16] flowers and all these different things
[51:18] and they wonder and they say my nature
[51:22] is such a wonderful thing yeah isn't it
[51:26] amazing how the seasons change in this
[51:28] tree uh all of a sudden it can it can be
[51:31] in full bloom and then at a certain
[51:33] season it looks like it's dead there's
[51:37] no life in it I don't know about you but
[51:40] sometimes I feel like within my own life
[51:43] that the four seasons of nature my my
[51:45] life presents it in a single 24-hour
[51:50] day oh I can be on fire for God and I
[51:53] can be a big old Burly tree Full of Life
[51:56] full of fruit and then all of a sudden I
[51:58] could be as dry as a as a barnyard floor
[52:02] I could
[52:03] be I I I could be losing my leaves I
[52:06] could be losing my fruit and all of a
[52:08] sudden it could look like I'd be dead in
[52:10] the water and then all of a sudden a few
[52:13] hours later wow I'm starting to feel
[52:15] good again praise the Lord amen four
[52:18] seasons of life in one
[52:20] day it's like I'm living back in Ireland
[52:24] again
[52:28] people they look at this stuff and they
[52:31] say wow that's amazing but as the
[52:35] bride when we look at
[52:38] nature we see death we see burial and we
[52:42] see resurrection and we say wow God I'm
[52:47] looking at your nature what is it that
[52:50] I'm looking at yeah I can see the the
[52:52] natural things that's going on but I see
[52:55] The Plan of
[52:56] Redemption when I look at a tree and
[52:59] when I look at the grass and when I look
[53:00] at the seasons it's not just the natural
[53:03] things I'm looking at but it's the
[53:05] supernatural things it's the plan of God
[53:08] his his plan is written all around
[53:12] us it's hidden in plain sight it's
[53:16] hidden from those who aren't supposed to
[53:18] see it but it's revealed to those who
[53:21] are ordained to catch the mysteries of
[53:24] God
[53:25] am thank you Lord understand sometimes
[53:29] in your
[53:30] life that God will be hidden in plain
[53:37] view according to your flesh man your C
[53:40] taste feel smelling here you'll be
[53:41] looking for
[53:43] God I don't see him you'll be feeling
[53:46] for God I don't feel his presence I
[53:49] don't feel them around me I I don't feel
[53:52] like my prayers are being answered I I
[53:54] don't feel good I I don't feel I don't
[53:56] see I don't touch I can't taste I what
[53:58] is it God is still
[54:01] there because his word has declared it
[54:04] I'll never leave you I won't ever
[54:06] forsake you but I'm going to be with you
[54:08] don't worry about it don't worry what
[54:10] loud isia has to throw your way don't
[54:12] worry about what kind of sickness comes
[54:14] against you or comes against your pastor
[54:16] I'm in control God is in control tonight
[54:20] and he said he be with
[54:23] us God is hidden Amen in plain sight so
[54:28] instead of looking for God as as people
[54:31] will look at the stars and the moon and
[54:33] all these different things we need to
[54:36] step out by faith amen and say father
[54:39] this is what your word has declared and
[54:42] because your word has declared it I
[54:44] believe it and therefore by faith I'm
[54:47] reaching out and I'm going to say I
[54:49] believe your word more than I believe
[54:53] myself I believe your word word more
[54:56] than what I believe what I can see taste
[54:58] feel smell or hear why because the word
[55:00] will never let you
[55:02] down because the word is
[55:06] God thank you Lord and He swore by
[55:10] himself because he could swear by no one
[55:13] greater if he was to swear by you and I
[55:16] guess what we would let each other he
[55:18] would let us down it would just be a
[55:20] complete mess but because we're
[55:23] depending upon God who never sleeps nor
[55:26] does he Slumber because we're depending
[55:28] upon God who believed in his own word to
[55:31] bring it to pass guess what amen
[55:33] everything will be all
[55:36] right praise God tell yourself it's
[55:39] going to be
[55:40] okay tell your neighbor it's going to be
[55:42] all right tell your neighbor that God is
[55:45] in control you say brother Steven when
[55:48] will he fulfill the promise I don't know
[55:51] it doesn't matter when he's going to
[55:53] fulfill it just hold on to it
[55:55] [Applause]
[55:56] [Music]
[55:57] you say brother Steven that's easier
[55:59] said than done it is for the carnal man
[56:03] but by faith Abraham what did Abraham
[56:05] say his faith didn't grow weaker as he
[56:08] got older his faith didn't grow weaker
[56:11] as he got weaker in body but his faith
[56:14] grew stronger amen it seems like the
[56:16] church is weak but we're not weak
[56:20] because God is perfected in our weakness
[56:23] so don't look at the circumstances look
[56:25] to
[56:26] God God will bring his word to pass God
[56:30] will take care of things God will take
[56:32] care of the situations in our families
[56:34] and our loved ones and sicknesses and
[56:37] our children God will take care of it
[56:39] you just got to give it to
[56:42] him I hit a little bit of inspiration
[56:45] over in
[56:47] vanatu a lot of them they were they were
[56:50] uh they're struggling with their kids it
[56:52] felt like they were losing their kids
[56:55] and I remembered of the story of
[56:57] Hannah how that before God would bless
[57:00] Hannah with a child Hannah had to say
[57:03] father if you give me a child I'll give
[57:06] the child to you first she had to say
[57:09] Lord I give this child to you if you
[57:12] will give me a child God is wanting us
[57:15] to give our children to give our
[57:17] families over into the hands of God and
[57:20] God will take care of the rest of it us
[57:24] help us it's like brother Bram you
[57:26] remember when his wife got sick or not
[57:28] his wife his mama was sick onto death
[57:31] and here he is he's up there and he's
[57:33] preaching and he makes a a a statement
[57:36] and and he says you know how do you
[57:38] think I can stand up here and preach
[57:40] like nothing like nothing is wrong
[57:43] because in his own mind and in his heart
[57:45] nothing was wrong because he knew who
[57:49] hands his mom was
[57:51] in amen hallelujah trust God trust God
[57:57] for your needs trust God for your
[58:03] circumstances he wants us to live our
[58:05] lives by faith
[58:07] Hallelujah faith is not
[58:10] believing that God might come on faith
[58:15] is not hoping and sympathizing and
[58:18] saying well he might if it is his will
[58:23] but faith speaks with a boldness amen
[58:27] and faith says that God will
[58:32] amen it doesn't matter of the timing
[58:35] timing has nothing to do with it but
[58:38] Faith speaks with a boldness and says
[58:41] God will and I believe it hallelujah
[58:46] amen hallelujah
[58:50] amen the world sees one
[58:53] thing yeah as it looks at this planet
[58:57] Earth and the galaxies and all these
[58:59] different things the world sees one
[59:02] thing but the bride sees another though
[59:05] we're both looking at the same
[59:09] thing he take your Bible for instance
[59:12] there's 900 plus denominations and they
[59:15] all preach from the same word and why is
[59:18] it that we are so different in our lives
[59:20] and how we conduct ourselves why can
[59:23] they read the same Bible that we can
[59:25] read but yet our our sisters dress in
[59:28] modest apparel why is it that they can
[59:31] read the same Bible that we can read and
[59:33] as men we say no I don't go to those
[59:35] places I don't say those things I don't
[59:37] do those things I don't act that way
[59:39] even though we're reading the same Bible
[59:42] it's because we're seeing something
[59:45] different we're not looking at it like
[59:48] it's a newspaper or some kind of Novel
[59:51] but we're looking at it and reading
[59:53] Between the Lines by prophetic Insight
[59:56] amen and because we have a prophetic
[59:59] Insight it gives us the vision of God
[1:00:03] hallelujah hallelujah that's what makes
[1:00:06] us different is because we have a
[1:00:09] prophetic Insight that we're looking
[1:00:11] between the lines and we say that's not
[1:00:13] what pleases God this is what pleases
[1:00:18] God oh thank God for a prophetic Insight
[1:00:22] thank God for prophetic glasses is that
[1:00:24] we can look upon the word in in Ultra
[1:00:29] HD and we can go wow and we can look at
[1:00:32] the things in nature and we can go wow
[1:00:35] I'm not seeing what other carnal people
[1:00:37] are seeing but I'm seeing something
[1:00:40] completely
[1:00:41] different you Lord thank you Lord
[1:00:46] am thank you
[1:00:48] Lord

[1:01:16] that we see they've saw the same picture
[1:01:19] in Life magazine that we look at but
[1:01:21] when we look at the picture we see
[1:01:23] something complet completely different
[1:01:26] God hiding himself in plain view but
[1:01:30] revealing himself to those who are
[1:01:32] supposed to see
[1:01:33] it we're looking at the same thing we're
[1:01:36] looking at the same picture but we're
[1:01:38] seeing something completely different
[1:01:40] with our hearts oh what a God we
[1:01:44] serve how happy should that make us
[1:01:46] tonight to realize who we are and to
[1:01:49] realize that God has opened the eyes of
[1:01:51] your understanding and he said no take

[1:02:47] saying this and that about it when I see
[1:02:48] it I see the perfect outline of his face
[1:02:52] amen I see the perfect outline of his
[1:02:54] wig
[1:02:54] I see the the seventh angel with his SW
[1:02:57] his wings swept back I see it I see the
[1:03:01] picture within the picture why do I see
[1:03:04] it because we're ordained to see
[1:03:07] it thank you Lord what a God we serve
[1:03:11] am
[1:03:13] amen third pole of his
[1:03:16] ministry it was hidden in plain sight
[1:03:20] yes right right right it was a secret
[1:03:23] pool at a it's a pool that he that he
[1:03:26] that he wasn't supposed to say anything
[1:03:28] about made a mess of the first two pools
[1:03:32] ah William brandom all you've done is
[1:03:33] make a bunch of carnal
[1:03:35] impersonations this one don't teach them
[1:03:38] don't try to teach Pentecostal babies
[1:03:41] spiritual things because they can't
[1:03:44] handle it because they're babies they
[1:03:47] just want to play with the gifts they
[1:03:50] just want to play around out here with
[1:03:52] feeli good stuff but when it comes time
[1:03:54] to get in line with the word they don't
[1:03:56] want it they can't handle it but when
[1:03:59] the word comes and it strikes your heart
[1:04:01] and he's telling us to get back in step
[1:04:03] we say yes sir amen why because we have
[1:04:08] representation we have representation
[1:04:11] from God
[1:04:12] [Applause]
[1:04:14] Almighty and standing back amen amen it
[1:04:18] hurts it's kind of hard to live but I
[1:04:21] say amen amen it's kind of hard to do so
[1:04:24] sometimes but I say Amen
[1:04:30] anyways people look at the this part of
[1:04:33] his ministry they say he got
[1:04:36] off but we're looking at the same
[1:04:38] Ministry we listen to the same sermons
[1:04:42] we read the same books and we say he
[1:04:44] didn't get off he got on
[1:04:46] Amen
[1:04:49] word what was he doing riding the
[1:04:53] trail
[1:04:57] Hallelujah John 14:
[1:04:59] 19 yet a little while in the world seeth
[1:05:02] me no more but ye see me Hallelujah
[1:05:05] because I live ye shall live
[1:05:10] also the world is not going to see me
[1:05:13] anymore I'm going to be hidden in plain
[1:05:17] sight they're not going to see me but
[1:05:20] you're going to see me and so the works
[1:05:23] that I did you're going to do also why
[1:05:26] because you see me you see the word
[1:05:28] being fulfilled how do we see him today
[1:05:30] not just in each other we see him by the
[1:05:33] revealed word that he is the same
[1:05:36] yesterday today and forever
[1:05:40] amen Matthew 1310 through1 and the
[1:05:43] disciples came and said unto him why
[1:05:45] speakest thou unto them in Parables he
[1:05:48] answered and said unto them because it
[1:05:49] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[1:05:51] of the Kingdom of Heaven amen but to
[1:05:54] them it is not given they heard the same
[1:06:00] messages they heard the same sermons
[1:06:03] they heard the same words but to them it
[1:06:06] was in Parables why because they didn't
[1:06:08] have a teacher Hallelujah they didn't
[1:06:11] have a teacher to teach them what the
[1:06:13] truth of the parable
[1:06:15] was the Holy Spirit is the what the
[1:06:19] revealer of Truth he the spirit of Truth
[1:06:24] and so when we've been sealed of God by
[1:06:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost what
[1:06:29] happens the spirit of Truth Now reveals
[1:06:32] unto us The
[1:06:34] Parables given to one not given to
[1:06:37] another one the same Parable the same
[1:06:39] sermons the same Bible as God hidden in
[1:06:43] plain
[1:06:45] sight
[1:06:47] hallelujah thank you
[1:06:50] Lord the deity of Jesus Christ 1949
[1:06:54] like someone was speaking the other day
[1:06:56] he said God what was he when he was back
[1:06:59] young millions and millions of years ago
[1:07:01] just like this space here and then he
[1:07:04] gathered up into the lugos and then he
[1:07:06] came from the lugos down into Christ see
[1:07:10] it's just God coming down like this to
[1:07:12] the Earth it's not separate people it's
[1:07:16] not separate entities it's not separate
[1:07:19] spirits but it's God that's
[1:07:21] condescending himself
[1:07:26] down into Christ see it's just God
[1:07:28] coming down like this to the Earth then
[1:07:31] going right back into God again don't
[1:07:34] you see what I mean just
[1:07:37] revolving coming down through space from
[1:07:40] eternity rolling together coming down
[1:07:43] into the logos from the logos there into
[1:07:46] man then returning back again for one
[1:07:50] purpose Hallelujah to redeem that man
[1:07:54] that had
[1:07:55] fallen praise the Lord now when I read
[1:07:58] that quote I begin to think when did he
[1:08:02] begin to condescend amen did he begin to
[1:08:06] come down whenever Jesus died upon the
[1:08:09] cross for our
[1:08:10] sins did he begin to come down whenever
[1:08:14] Adam fell in the Garden of Eden no he
[1:08:18] began to condescend Before Time Ever
[1:08:21] began he began to cond descend before
[1:08:25] there was ever Stardust before there was
[1:08:27] any creation before there was any Angels
[1:08:30] before there was any sin because he had
[1:08:33] one purpose in his mind that he wanted
[1:08:35] to redeem those that would need redeemed
[1:08:39] who were in his mind since before the
[1:08:42] foundations of the
[1:08:44] [Applause]
[1:08:46] world so God had
[1:08:49] you in his
[1:08:51] thought thank you Lord
[1:08:55] long before you ever
[1:08:58] sinned God had you in his thoughts long
[1:09:01] before you ever made a mistake God had
[1:09:04] you in his thoughts long before there
[1:09:06] was ever sin Stardust or anything to do
[1:09:09] with
[1:09:10] creation that makes you a very special
[1:09:13] person in the mind of God hallelujah
[1:09:15] that he would
[1:09:17] condescend because in his mind he had a
[1:09:20] plan he had he had this drama that
[1:09:22] certain people would begin to unfold and
[1:09:25] be a part
[1:09:28] of oh Hallelujah that makes you very
[1:09:34] special makes you very unique
[1:09:37] hallelujah amen and it should make you
[1:09:39] realize that this flesh man that you
[1:09:41] deal with this guy that's full of
[1:09:45] sin this guy that's full of iniquity let
[1:09:49] me tell you something that don't mean
[1:09:52] nothing cuz the price has already been
[1:09:55] paid oh thank you
[1:09:57] Lord Lord long before you ever
[1:10:02] fail long before you ever needed a
[1:10:07] savior it was already provided
[1:10:11] Hallelujah and so long before that you
[1:10:14] ever going to make a
[1:10:16] Rapture God has already made the way for
[1:10:20] it to happen we don't have to push up or
[1:10:23] push out jump up or make anything happen
[1:10:25] no we just got to live our lives and let
[1:10:27] God take care of the
[1:10:30] rest
[1:10:32] amen hallelujah when we see God he was
[1:10:36] just changing his mask amen he was
[1:10:39] making himself known he was making his
[1:10:42] attributes and his characteristics known
[1:10:45] through the logos and then through Jesus
[1:10:48] Christ and then when he went from Jesus
[1:10:50] Christ he ascended back up on high right
[1:10:54] amen back to where he was in the
[1:10:56] beginning that's right he says I came
[1:11:00] from God I'm going back to godall but
[1:11:04] I'm not going to leave you comfortless
[1:11:06] cuz I'm going to be with
[1:11:08] you and so here was
[1:11:10] Paul Paul was walking down the Damascus
[1:11:13] Road and he meets this light this
[1:11:18] Halo something very Supernatural was
[1:11:21] happening in his
[1:11:22] life he was out there with his own
[1:11:25] carnality his own reasoning his own
[1:11:28] knowledge his own teaching from
[1:11:31] Gia persecuting the church but when he
[1:11:35] sees this light it brings him to his
[1:11:37] knees and he says Lord tell me who you
[1:11:41] are I want to know your name who are you
[1:11:45] he said I am Jesus who you're
[1:11:47] persecuting Jesus had already been dead
[1:11:49] buried and resurrected but when he was
[1:11:52] persecuting his bride when he was
[1:11:55] persecuting his body he was persecuting
[1:11:59] him what was he doing he was revolving
[1:12:03] going back to what he was to the glory
[1:12:05] that he had with the father in the
[1:12:07] beginning not a different person not a
[1:12:10] different entity Hallelujah not a
[1:12:12] different Spirit but it's
[1:12:14] God it's God who who dwelt in vest of
[1:12:18] nothing it was God in the lugos it was
[1:12:21] God in Jesus Christ and it's God and you
[1:12:24] and I it's the same God it's not a
[1:12:28] different spirit it's not a different
[1:12:30] person but it's God
[1:12:33] himself wow and the bright says
[1:12:37] wow that's amazing how can God dwell in
[1:12:42] me I don't know but he does
[1:12:43] [Applause]
[1:12:45] it
[1:12:46] [Applause]
[1:12:50] Hallelujah if you were in his mind then
[1:12:52] and he cared enough to
[1:12:54] condescend understand you're still in
[1:12:57] his mind now and he still cares amen
[1:13:01] thank
[1:13:03] youus hallelujah hallelujah God
[1:13:07] cares for your every need God cares
[1:13:11] about all of your situations in
[1:13:14] life just put your trust in
[1:13:20] him so what is the word
[1:13:24] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:13:26] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:13:30] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[1:13:32] amongst us the word is
[1:13:37] God so when I read my
[1:13:41] Bible what am I
[1:13:44] reading
[1:13:46] God when I read the word what is it that
[1:13:50] I'm reading I'm reading about his
[1:13:52] attributes amen I'm reading about his
[1:13:55] characteristics I'm reading about what
[1:13:57] he likes and I'm reading about what he
[1:14:00] doesn't like it's not just some book
[1:14:02] that was pieced together but it's the
[1:14:05] anointed Eternal infinite word of God
[1:14:09] that he put on paper for us to read that
[1:14:12] we might understand
[1:14:15] him excuse
[1:14:17] me amen so how do you understand
[1:14:22] God
[1:14:25] by
[1:14:26] revelation of God
[1:14:29] himself how do I understand his
[1:14:33] characteristics I just flip the
[1:14:36] pages and I say
[1:14:38] father give me that spiritual
[1:14:43] Revelation that I need to get me through
[1:14:46] this life's
[1:14:47] journey but not only that Lord I have a
[1:14:51] desire that I might understand stand you
[1:14:53] you know what he's saying read the word
[1:14:57] amen because when you're reading the
[1:15:00] word you're reading
[1:15:03] God is that too
[1:15:05] simple it's a fact amen it is so how do
[1:15:11] we become closer with God in our
[1:15:14] lives read the word amen be a part of
[1:15:21] God take the little book
[1:15:24] John and don't just take it and look at
[1:15:27] it come on but take it and eat it
[1:15:31] because what you eat becomes a part of
[1:15:34] you let this word become a part of you
[1:15:37] John don't let it get dust in your house
[1:15:41] don't have to dust it off every couple
[1:15:44] of weeks before you read it no take it
[1:15:46] John eat it John become it John and walk
[1:15:52] it
[1:15:54] amen
[1:15:57] hallelujah as the musicians come we'll
[1:16:00] bring this to a
[1:16:06] close my brother and my
[1:16:10] sister we need to stop reading our
[1:16:15] Bibles like it's some kind of
[1:16:19] newspaper musicians where where's our
[1:16:21] musicians yeah come come come
[1:16:23] praise the Lord you weren't ready to
[1:16:26] come were
[1:16:31] you they want
[1:16:37] more to much of the time guilty of it
[1:16:42] myself we read the word because we have
[1:16:47] to we read the word because it's our
[1:16:50] duty as a
[1:16:51] Christian oh well suppose I should read
[1:16:54] my Bible
[1:16:56] today reading our Bibles with this kind
[1:16:59] of attitude doesn't get us anywhere with
[1:17:01] God that's right
[1:17:04] nope right it's just reading that's
[1:17:07] right we're just getting a an
[1:17:10] understanding and a lot of the times
[1:17:13] depending where you're reading in your
[1:17:14] Bible you won't understand
[1:17:17] it
[1:17:19] wow all I see is oh he numbered this one
[1:17:23] and numbered that one okay yeah yeah and
[1:17:26] this one and to this tribe there was
[1:17:28] this amount and to that tribe there was
[1:17:30] that okay yeah yeah okay very good I'll
[1:17:33] turn somewhere else I'm not quite
[1:17:35] catching anything here let me turn to
[1:17:37] somewhere else within the scripture oh H
[1:17:40] Ezekiel my there's a wheel within the
[1:17:43] wheel what does that
[1:17:46] mean I don't understand I I'm reading it
[1:17:49] and and I'm not understanding it it's
[1:17:51] because of our attitude sometime and how
[1:17:54] we approach
[1:17:57] God instead of reading it because we
[1:18:00] have to read it we should say
[1:18:03] father I'm going to read your
[1:18:07] word and I'm going to hold it to my
[1:18:10] heart
[1:18:11] amen because th word oh God have I hid
[1:18:14] in my
[1:18:15] heart because my heart is such a sacred
[1:18:19] place it's not something that I want to
[1:18:21] share with just any
[1:18:23] body and because it's so sacred Lord I
[1:18:26] want you to be a part of my
[1:18:28] heart and so now Lord I'm taking your
[1:18:31] word and before I read it I realize that
[1:18:34] this is you and you're trying to show me
[1:18:37] something you're trying to show me a
[1:18:39] shadow you're trying to show me a type
[1:18:41] you're trying to show me something in my
[1:18:43] life you're before all I see is
[1:18:47] numbers all I see is tribes and numbers
[1:18:50] but when God begins to deal with us amen
[1:18:53] by
[1:18:54] Revelation don't be surprised when God
[1:18:57] shows you something different about that
[1:18:59] tribe when God reveals to you what the
[1:19:02] wheel inside the wheel is when God
[1:19:05] begins to show you that hey these things
[1:19:08] that you didn't understand before I'm
[1:19:10] going to reveal it to
[1:19:11] you why because your attitude is
[1:19:14] different
[1:19:15] am because your approach is
[1:19:18] different when we approach God and we
[1:19:22] say father yes let me read between the
[1:19:26] lines let me see the picture that's
[1:19:29] within the picture father and watch God
[1:19:33] deal with your heart yes praise the Lord
[1:19:35] watch God begin to open the
[1:19:37] understanding of your heart and as you
[1:19:40] flick through the pages things change
[1:19:43] things begin to open up
[1:19:46] why because your approach is different
[1:19:50] to God because when we are approaching
[1:19:53] his word to read it we are approaching
[1:19:58] God himself
[1:20:02] amen just the same as when we when we
[1:20:06] pray there's an approach to God about
[1:20:08] certain things amen but there's a
[1:20:11] special approach toward his
[1:20:13] word the word that's good it's not just
[1:20:18] a word right it's not just a sword come
[1:20:23] on it's not the sword of a
[1:20:26] king but it's the sword of the
[1:20:30] king this is not just a word a word this
[1:20:35] is not just a compilation of compilation
[1:20:38] of books that have been putting together
[1:20:41] to make one big book but this is the
[1:20:45] word hallelujah of the one true
[1:20:48] God who makes himself known through the
[1:20:51] word amen yes Hallelujah let me just
[1:20:55] drive it home and clinch the nail as
[1:20:57] brother Ron says when you read the word
[1:21:02] approach him correctly yes very good
[1:21:06] approach him in the right
[1:21:08] way approach reading your word like
[1:21:10] you're approaching the very throne room
[1:21:13] and presence of God
[1:21:16] itself because that's what it is
[1:21:20] yeah anybody can flip through
[1:21:23] it anybody can read
[1:21:26] it but God is
[1:21:28] hidden in plain
[1:21:31] sight you can read the word and it'll be
[1:21:34] hidden from
[1:21:36] you but understand he's
[1:21:40] hiding between the
[1:21:43] verses he's hiding between the
[1:21:46] stories he's hiding between the
[1:21:49] Shadows why is he hiding because it's
[1:21:52] not given to everybody to understand it
[1:21:55] oh
[1:21:56] Hallelujah but he's waiting for you to
[1:21:59] approach him in the right way that he
[1:22:02] might say here you
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:04] go here I
[1:22:06] am here I am within the word here I am
[1:22:10] within the story here I am within the
[1:22:13] type and when he begins to reveal
[1:22:15] himself of who he is he doesn't stop
[1:22:19] there amen oh beautiful
[1:22:23] but he continues to reveal him because
[1:22:26] what good is it if he reveals himself
[1:22:29] but he doesn't Reveal Your Part within
[1:22:32] the word amen so when he begins to
[1:22:35] reveal himself now he opens your
[1:22:38] understanding to my
[1:22:40] goodness I'm
[1:22:46] Rebecca I'm the
[1:22:48] bride that's
[1:22:50] me I almost can't can't believe it tell
[1:22:54] your flesh man to shut
[1:22:57] up because it's your spiritual
[1:22:59] man it's the seed that God has imparted
[1:23:03] within
[1:23:04] you that's what's crying out and that's
[1:23:07] what's realizing who I really am and why
[1:23:10] I'm here and where I'm going amen God
[1:23:14] bless you let's stand this evening
