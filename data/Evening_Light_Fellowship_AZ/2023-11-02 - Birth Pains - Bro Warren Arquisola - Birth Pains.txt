last time he came through I was out of town so he let me know he was coming in and I said well brother Paul being that you're here why don't you take a service for me well that's not why I'm I said I know but I'd like to have you because I love to have a good crosssection of the five-fold ministry not that I'm looking for somebody to preach for us that's not it but I believe you're going to be blessed I believe brother Paul is a man called of God and uh so we'll look forward to him preaching for us on Sunday morning I want to give a big special thanks to all of those that helped our sister Kelly Saunders and brother Steve to put together the family night um yeah you don't have to have little ones to come to family night okay we do this for all of you man we had we had soups and we had chilies and we had uh those corn chips with cheese nacho and I I tell you it was just a good time and it is always a blessed time for me to be able to sit down and fellowship with some of you on a onetoone basis sit around a table have some food a time of Fellowship so if you didn't make it you missed it you missed it you should amen amen don't get mad at me it'd be like you throwing a birthday party and nobody show up you blow out the candles by yourself wouldn't that be happy birthday to me you don't want to do that we do it because it's an opportunity for our family church to get together and have a time of Fellowship so if you miss it that's that's okay i' I'd love to have you all be there and everything uh I also want to say I certainly had a lovely time with my young couples the other day Sunday afternoon um as a pastor I think it's very very important once in a while I have meetings with the young couples we sit down and have some some questions and answers have some good uh spiritual Fellowship one with another and I get a good cross-section of kind of feeling their temperature their mood what they're what the things that they're going through problematic areas what because uh uh it certainly is uh uh a late hour and the enemy is doing everything he can to try to divide and conquer that's right he starts with the first family it's what he did in Eden he does it all the way down so if he can come in and and and cause any kind of a div division he'll do it that's right and so we don't we want to make sure that we don't have no spirits on us that want to divide and conquer and and everything like that we want to come together for the unity of the faith can we say Amen Amen to that and I want to say to our young musicians that are here tonight and I

sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remember she remember it no more the anguish for joy that a man is born unto the world let's bow our heads father it's it's true Lord that the woman is travail it for pain because of there's another life coming Lord this is what I want to share to the Believers you give me a thought because I saw from the news I read from the papers that this is the time of delivering a new life Lord help us to see what time are we living in yes Lord help us to to watch day and night seeking your your your coming oh God Lord this world is empty there's no good to offer but we have hope father thank you Lord that this hope there will be no more pain no more sorrow no more parting apart but Close to You fellowship with one another I cannot wait to shake the hand of Billy Paul I cannot wait to shake the hand of Peter and John Lord but we cannot go there without this fuel this Holy Spirit Lord God that we can find it here in the message Lord Jesus open our minds tonight open our hearts we will worship you I don't want a rock to worship instead of me that's right I want you Lord The Rock I want you the revelation will come tonight to deliver your word just use me as your instrument father in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can have a seat amen you know the prophet was talking about the birth pains how the woman traal it so he said you know there's a uh uh if you look at the science they have according to the science there are three trimesters that the woman there's a a changes in the body of a woman but then once they reach the the third trimester there there's a three uh they called that the three Agony or or labor pains now you see if it's the baby is ready to come first the water will come out the blood and the life now we are talking tonight about the birth pains because we see the signs already that that this is the time of of a labor pain you know the prophet was talking about the cloud about the blue sky but then when the blue skies are pregnated it will turn dark but then this blue sky will will ready to deliver and then it will agonize the cloud there will be a thunder and lightning coming forth because of the agony and then it will deliver rains and now we're happy to have rains especially here in Arizona amen it's a joy to the arizonians to have reins every time I go to to to to uh Prescot where where uh uh sister um Justice and the odd releves you see the burnt the the the the fire that burns their the whole mountains but then brother Russell said oh maybe there will be no more more no more uh uh bushes no more more trees will will live but then when the rain came down they saw different kinds of of seeds coming out amen that's the power of the rain then the prophet said now here's the Lily he said the Lily it's the the Lily is inside the mud the mock of the world the river that full of of dirt and and uh uh snakes and frogs but then here's the sunlight it bring for life to the Lily the muddy Lily the tiny germ when when when that light hits her it pregnated her and delivered a flower or a a seed or a plant but then it takes a a pressure because of the mud and the mock of the world it pushes her to go push and push and push until it will come out and then the flowers will come out amen what a beautiful Lily from the dirt of the world from from the M of the world and here is the flowers the prophet said you see the the beauty of the flower but then it gives life to the Beast it produce Nectars to the Beast to to see the butterflies coming and fellowship with that beautiful flower but then not only that my brothers and sisters that Lily if the science will harvested the flowers and smash these flowers it produce an opium and can deliver to the people that have pain in their bodies amen from the mck of the riv River yes From the Muddy Water it gives life to the people that have pains in their their their lives and the prophet said he is the lily of the valley amen hallelujah he is the rose of Sharon that's right that produces life that gives life gives gives a a a a a a help to the needy people thank you Lord that's our Lord Jesus Christ Lily but then the prophet said here in the message who is this MDC he said he also will renovate the world and will be burn over with fire and cleans every germ for millions of miles high everything will be cleaned off and then there is a new Heaven A New Earth I cannot wait to stay there this is not my home amen I am just a passenger I'm just a visitor here just like you are a new creature in Christ Jesus when the Holy Spirit takes hold of you see there you are the whole thing is just as plain as it can be everything is in there or in three amen the natural birth is in three what is the first thing happen happens to a woman having a baby that breaks first water that breaks next blood that's the next process Life water blood and spirit see brothers that's the same thing it's it's perfected in in three now but then I was thinking of of my life and and this when the pastor from uh AUA Preta brother Lupe lupz stood up we had a Minister's meetings and then he stood up and said brother you know what as an elder here because he's about 70 years old he's the oldest and he said whatever you do do the right thing if you do wrong in your life change it stop it there's no more time left we are the last book no one will will will read our history and and I was thinking about it you know it was my birthday that time I said you know when we were catholic we had a uh we called that the uh I will not do it anymore or I will this is my uh how do you say it uh resolution and I was searching the message and I found this from the getting in the spirit the the prophet said and so we glad to know that we are living in the last day and as a minister of the Gospel Ministers of the gospels or gospel all of us here preachers we have the privilege of speaking I believe to the elect of God in the last days and what a privilege this is for we minister to have this privilege of sitting on Earth here today or tonight and speaking to the last Church age and he said I forgot where's now he said the last church I believe that truly with all my heart that we are speaking now to the last last Church age that we will finally wind up in the lysan church and then Jesus will come and it will all be over and I'll be glad when that happens amen I feel like John of bold even so come Lord Jesus even so I just about Sin enough of it I I I was going around and look like Instead This was 1961 was going around and look like instead of getting better why the world gets more wicked all the time amen I think like John said even so come Lord Jesus then it will be all over amen and I was thinking about this I am we ministers Pastor Ron we ministers I am I have an opportunity to speak to the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you are the last bride God pulled you out from lysan age and put you to the bride age thank you Lord brothers and sisters what an opportunity as one of the pastor was telling me brother Warren think about this the Yale University Professor he was proud to stand in front of the television to the people and say I am Professor from Yale University and his chin was up was proud being a professor speaking to a yel university to a yell students temporary I am a professor from Harvard University but what a privilege to say I am preaching to the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God anointed the preachers the pastors the five-fold ministry to to unite all the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ in one mind one Accord one baptism just to praise him what an opportunity amen the prophet said here in the blending of Eternity he said we are standing tonight upon the brim and watching come to pass and unfold to two great sins and those two great sins are this one of them is the ending of history and the other one is the ending of time and many great men down Through the Ages has longed to see this hour that we're now approaching and as we live in this glorious sitting of mortal Sun the breaking of Eternal Light I do feel that we're living in one of the grandest ages amen the grandest we're living in the grandest ages that ever man has been permitted to live I think everybody can say I am hungry brother Warren preach it I am hungry especially that kind the message that's me Mama Hallelujah man has been permitted to live because it's the closing out of time and the blending of Eternity we're at the end friends amen remember I was telling you about the 90 seconds left the science in Matthew chapter 4 or 24 it said here now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and puted forth leaves ye know that summer is night now he was talking to Israel watch that that is your calendar that is your time piece you need to see watch the movement of Israel because that is the question of the disciples when and how do we know and the prophet and and Jesus Christ was telling them at the signs but then he said in the 37th or 35 When Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass pass away remember this Heaven and Earth will pass away but I'm telling you this is thus said the Lord my word will not pass away and then he continued he said but as of the day and the hour know it no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only continue brother up to 37 thank you but as the days of Noah where so shall also the coming of the son of man for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating they were drinking they were marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark is it the same condition amen they don't really care about what's happening right now now I think on the 23rd there was a big shootings in Florida and two nights before there was a big shooting in Maine those are the signs but then here's the Revelation on the 25th he said there was a five virgins 10 virgins they prepared they were not uh they don't sleep they were watching for the coming of the the bridegroom I think I am one of them amen I think I am one of them that that's that not uh that's as I was preaching last two weeks ago or a couple weeks ago about be sober be vigilant amen now the prophet said we're we're right now seeing the very same thing that Jesus said would take place this own word spake it spoke it as it was in the days of lot so it will be at the coming of the son of man the same thing look at your country here now it's perverted look at the newspapers I seen an analysis where homosexual is on the increase about 20% over the last year on the west coast the sins of Sodom took look how everything being perverted the waters the streams everything contaminated did you hear about the the The Waters from Michigan people had cancer because of the waters and the prophet was speaking here 1959 the diseases viruses that the doctors know nothing about it or about where at the end time flee to the Rock flee to Christ get into him quickly amen see we don't forget brother that the coid 19 we don't forget the wars the the for the first time in history that the the White House became a rainbow house and the prophet was saying that the increase of the perversion of the homosexuals there was a news well brother brandham you you just heard uh he read the newspaper so I was looking about the news there was a man standing he said remember sin even it legalized by men it's still sin in the eyes of God there was a man standing in in the US capital and he put a sign board and said Don't Legalize rape well what does that mean well they legalize abortion that's killing babies they legalize gay marriage that's that's a um filthiness but you know there's new no new thing under the sun it will go back from the days of Noah and lot but here he said please Don't Legalize rape maybe more and more years that's why the prophet said he cannot see the darkness of this time here the the billboard in Chicago it said life is short get a divorce it was a big billboard in Chicago to me it was a blasphemy amen you take the word of the Lord and show it to the people about the filthiness of what you're doing so that you can make more money the lawyers posted this my Daniel chter 4 uh 12:4 but thou oh Daniel shut up the book the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased he saw the end time but the the angel said don't write sealed it up because there will be be a man a a prophet anointed of an eagle anointing he he can see everything he said but then he said many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased now you can see more colleges are set up more online schools it seems like every everybody is uh the the government are pushing the people to get your your education get your your Masters get your doctors I'm not preaching against education my brothers and sisters but if that education will pull you out from the message stop it there's no time amen the prophet said you know the the preachers if if the preacher Don't Preach the word they lay down the bars then the ship will get out and the Wolves will come in Brothers it's time to move on don't stop don't go back that's right but we must never forget that all education is man's manmade but you cannot save your soul from Hell amen the prophet said education can never give us Life Education can never science can't give us life the world can't give us life there is only one thing can give you life and that's Christ he is life the Abundant Life That's Right Hallelujah my I felt like I'm preaching I'm I'm really going to preach now Jesus speaking when when you see the fig tree uh put forth its BD now the the Jews has been scattered put forth its bud or scattered all all the world great numbers well the Jews uh Jesus speaking when you see the Fig Tree put fors its bad now the Jews has been scattered all over the world great numbers millions in Germany and in Italy and the United States all over the world Amen Russia have you been uh noticing the paper that we the United States are taking side with the Arabs oh brother the handwriting on the wall amen God said whosoever blessed blesses Israel will be blessed who curses Israel shall be cursed amen now there was a big meetings there was 200 rabbis gathered in Europe and the meeting was they asked they want to to a they they they actually they encourage all the Jews leing all over the world they said they must this is must be the best Exodus will happen he said there's no more you're not safe in Europe anymore you are not safe in America anymore did you see the the news in Cornell University they put son H the the flag of David in their rooms that so that and it reminded me when they did that to Hitler when Hitler put all the uh the signs on the Jewish doors they mark them if you that this man lives here are Jewish they're Jewish so the increase according to the news the increase of anti-Semitic is on the rise here in America all over the world now the the the the the rabbi was playing please there's no safe place here in in Europe let's go back to Israel and I was thinking of thei or Naomi and uh uh her husband when there was trouble in Israel they went to another country and what happened his her husband died his two children died because there is no promise out side of Israel brothers and sisters we are the spiritual Israel there is no good thing will happen to you outside of this message

the nominal churches they're Gathering their own too amen Satan is gathering his own too that's right how about the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I believe I've been to so many churches I can say we are not denominated I can see as we brother Ron and me were talking over there with brother Stephen there are churches like a Corinthian Church a troubled Church all the time galatian Church church but I believe this church is an epan church we can preach the word here and people will say Amen to the word amen we conduct ourselves here like a bride of the Lord Jesus Christ we don't want somebody to rebuke you we don't want somebody to rebuke me I want to conduct myself in front of you like a minister of the Lord Jesus Christ we are chosen generation of God that's right as the brother said if we do right keep doing it if we do wrong stop it amen this is no time to play the bride had made herself ready the right righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ it's in me amen he said now let's look at the doctor's book if she is in this kind of a condition and see if this is supposed to happened when the new Earth is to be born Matthew 2 for in the books in in the doctor's books which is the Bible and let's see what's prophesied what her symptom would be now if a doctor knows the symptoms of uh of birth of a child and just about time the child is to come he get everything ready because he knows that the time that the child is to be born because all symptoms shows water broke the blood and now it's time the child is dropped and it's time for the child to be born and so he gets everything ready for it remember this world the water broke in the time of Noah the blood came out in the time of Jesus at Calvary can we see the coming of the baby now can you see the coming of this body change now I cannot wait I'm ready I'm groaning I'm expecting I am ready to a new Heaven and Earth amen Revelation said 11 and uh the I will destroy that destroyeth the earth I will destroy that destroyeth the earth look at the science look at the look at what they do to Earth second Peter chapter 3 but the days of the Lord will come as a thief in the night and the which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with per heat the Earth also and works that are therein shall be burned up see the the name the nuclear bomb they put United States China the name of United States in their nuclear bomb Russia United States in their bomb this when Peter saw the heaven will will will will be in a great noise because of the bum because of the fires it will melt all the elements here on the earth because it God will clean it he don't want you to live in the dirty Place amen he wants you to live in a new Heaven and a new Earth thank you Lord that's like in this body the the the do cannot live with this dirty earth that's why we groan all the time please if you make mistake please forgive me forgive me Lord we Gran we we we agonize daily the prophet said here for God said it was the whole Heaven and Earth is going to be on fire it's going to be a renovation of the whole thing so new world can be born God has prophesied it she's rotten all of her system she got to do that to rot away that's why she I said she is so nervous and and red in the face and plated and earthquakes everywhere and and up and down the coast and tidal waves in Alaska and shaking up down the coast of the earthquakes and things and people writing shall shall we leave it shall we leave it see they don't know what to do there no safety zone but one that's Christ the son of the Living God that there's only one thing that is safety zone and that's him all outside there will be there will perish just as certain as God said so amen amen brothers and sisters what are we waiting for I am waiting for his coming as the Bible said he came he's already here now the the the the UFO the science said the UFO is coming back and forth and the prophet said hey that's our the of anybody the the of anybody cannot wait to come to catch you brother brother Ray he's ready to come but then hey I I'm going here I'm going there but then there's another one still holding on maybe don't really know his position yet in the body I don't want to hold on I am ready amen as when I accepted the Lord in 19 1996 you know what was my favorite song he's coming soon he's coming soon with joy we welcome his returning it may be M it may be night or noon but we know he's coming soon Amen brother Mark I'm sorry but I sing from my heart brother see that I was waiting since 1996 one day I was working we don't have cars in the Philippines but then I I I I live far from the church I woke up early in the morning we don't we don't even have watch but then I woke up so early I went to church and there was nobody in the church and I was crying I was a young man I was a very young in the message but we keep preaching about the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord especially when the year 2000 the white to white Tok white Tok prepare prepare oh we keep singing he's coming soon he's coming soon but now how about now I am so happy to preach anytime anywhere about the coming of the Lord because I don't like this place see I'm coughing I don't even have a hair I cannot wait to live in a perfect place am you know the prophet said he over there the paradise emptied out and now all the all the saints went to to to uh another dimension and then according to the prophet in the things that are to be he said you know God gave you the desire you you well I'm poor I don't have a you know I have so many desires but I cannot come here because I don't have enough money to to pay or buy my desire so when I was young when I read that I said oh I I like to to live in the in the uh next to the waterfalls and the the water the mountain meets the ocean and the prophet said God will grant the desire of your heart amen he said God is a god of variety if if I brother if you like jokes there's somebody over there next to you God will put you over there if you're serious there's so many serious people over there too God is a god of vary that's why you know the disciples are always fighting but God gave you the desire of your heart over there amen thank you Lord now that's why I uh brother Ron when when the Prophet was preaching this this uh things that are to be and then the next time he preached the future home of the Heavenly bride and in the Heavenly bride he said now everything over there is like a transparent gold can you see transparent gold here no but God prepared a place for you he went first to prepare a place for you brothers and sisters there is no time to be like holding on I I pray that this message will touch your heart we agonize here the tree you can see the Tre are dying you know California I was reading the history the this the the news that they the why they allow the the the abortion because the fetus are very expensive so they use the fetus as a Max Factor now they use that for makeup if if somebody here put makeup please I don't like the fetus but that's what they do you know the the the they mix that with kind of a of uh dust from India and the the people from India are young kids digging that kind of sand or dust so that can make a Max Factor or like a makeup but here brothers and sisters we believe that the coming of the Lord is near if you see man I I I I'm a minister of the Gospel I see a person dying one time I saw this man like gasing for breath he was holding my hand I was holding him and then he was like he was he was something suffering he wants he wants to live more the the queen of of England the prophet said I think his name is uh her name is uh was Bloody Mary he said I will give my whole Kingdom if somebody can give me life maybe just a minute brother Ron see it's not worth it you work hard for your own kingdom but you cannot hold your life amen but that's why we struggle here because there's a perfect world over there Hallelujah the trees are struggling here because there are perfect trees over there God bless you may the Lord continue to bless this church and the Believers that we have one
