[46:26] taken and called these people before
[46:28] they were even born thank youus and
[46:30] you've called them for a
[46:32] purpose and they're a reflection of what

[47:54] to take them out for supper
[47:58] and show them some appreciation
[48:02] am I don't even hear some from musicians
[48:05] what do you think about
[48:08] that oh my CH Revelations 8
[48:13] again brother Oscar and his family had a
[48:16] wonderful time today having the
[48:18] fellowship with them at the hotel down
[48:20] there and I sure enjoyed it specially
[48:23] yesterday my it's not the it's not the
[48:25] instrument it's the heart behind the
[48:27] instrument my I enjoyed that yesterday
[48:30] and all the specials and the choir and
[48:33] me and my wife just want to say a
[48:35] wonderful sister Sarah a wonderful thank
[48:37] you for your generosity and your
[48:39] hospitality you've been such a wonderful
[48:41] audience to preach to and last night
[48:44] when I saw the Holy Spirit move in such
[48:46] a unique way man I thought brother Brian
[48:49] shouldn't have quit I think he should
[48:50] have been preaching this morning boy I
[48:53] had two bullet hit me right over
[48:55] there I didn't even blink I got it twice
[48:58] right
[49:00] there so I told Brother Brian this
[49:02] morning but you got to remember the
[49:04] sniper sits Higher One shot at a time
[49:08] shoots further to protect the machine
[49:10] gun so you know we you got a two- stage
[49:14] you got a two stage artillery here this
[49:17] morning you know thank you Lord he
[49:19] always says I'm going to put my truck a
[49:20] neutral and idle for a while well I'll
[49:22] pull out my horse how's
[49:24] that I'll put my Leger on the saddle
[49:28] have a sandwich for a while how's
[49:31] that should appreciate the gift in
[49:33] brother Brian but you know what it's not
[49:35] there's so many people gifted yeah but
[49:39] not many men surrender their gifts like
[49:41] that that's the work it's not the
[49:44] gift that's right it's not the gift the
[49:48] ability to surrender that gift is
[49:50] amazing and I've learned so much
[49:51] Revelations chapter 8 this is the
[49:54] Harvest
[49:55] chapter the seed chapters in The Book of
[49:58] Genesis you can find absolutely
[50:01] everything in the Book of Revelation in
[50:03] the Book of
[50:04] Genesis so all I'm going to do is start
[50:06] in the Harvest chapter and we'll get to
[50:09] a little bit going backwards Revelations
[50:12] 81 and when he had remember John what he
[50:15] was doing is they said John write what
[50:18] you see so John sees a white horse and
[50:21] he writes a white horse and then John
[50:23] sees a red one and he sees the Riders
[50:25] change and then John sees the lion and
[50:28] boy he's writing writing writing writing
[50:30] and he gets to the end of that Sixth
[50:32] Seal which is your tribulation seal and
[50:34] then he's going to write
[50:37] in
[50:43] yeah nothing's
[50:46] happening and he's
[50:48] stunned nothing is
[50:51] happening but the fact that nothing's
[50:53] happening as brother brandom says is
[50:56] actually the key to the
[50:58] bride is actually what because when John
[51:02] could say there's a white horse the
[51:05] devil could come and say there's a white
[51:06] horse but he had a black man okay so
[51:09] once it's written it can be
[51:12] perverted but when he looked up at the 8
[51:15] seven seal there's
[51:16] nothing yeah right amen how are you
[51:20] going to pervert
[51:23] nothing but the beautiful part is God
[51:26] knows how to call his
[51:29] bride and give him the
[51:33] transmission that the world sees nothing
[51:36] but the brid will see a full scale
[51:38] Revelation behind what the God sees
[51:41] nothing okay so Revelations 81 quickly
[51:44] when he had opened the seven seal there
[51:46] was silence in heaven about the space of
[51:47] a half hour and he saw seven angels
[51:50] which stood before God and to them was
[51:52] given seven trumpets and another angel
[51:54] came and stood at the altar remember
[51:56] this the incense altar right before the
[51:59] holiest of
[52:00] holies that he should offered with all
[52:03] the prayers of all the saints upon the
[52:05] golden altar which was before the throne
[52:07] and the smoke of the incense which came
[52:10] with the prayers of the Saints ascended
[52:12] up before God out of the Angel's hands
[52:15] and the angel took the sensor fill it
[52:17] with fire remember that's from the brass
[52:19] altar cast it on the earth and this was
[52:21] the result voices Thunder lightnings and
[52:26] an earthquake amen okay just while
[52:29] you're standing I got your attention if
[52:31] you go to the seventh vial you'll see
[52:34] voices Thunders Lightnings earthquakes
[52:38] when you see Moses come down the
[52:40] mountain revealing the word you see
[52:42] voices Thunders Lightnings and
[52:45] earthquakes if you go to Sunset Mountain
[52:48] you'll hear Thunders and voices and
[52:52] Lightnings but one thing be missing is
[52:54] earthquakes yeah but a year later he
[52:56] goes back to the same spot throws a rock
[52:58] in the air and completes the scriptures
[53:03] amen praise the
[53:05] lord it's just too
[53:08] good you may be seated this morning God
[53:11] bless
[53:16] you uh I'd like to just speak a little
[53:20] bit to last night with the I asked
[53:22] brother Ron if I could do this and to
[53:25] the people that came up for
[53:27] prayer uh last
[53:29] night you know let me just say this to
[53:33] you like this
[53:35] okay sometimes what happens is we get a
[53:38] false impression of what the Holy Ghost
[53:41] is and then that produces a false
[53:44] expectation right okay true so the point
[53:47] I'm going to make is you people that
[53:50] came up for prayer last night
[53:52] and I want you to understand something
[53:57] you came for
[53:58] prayer and for help because you felt
[54:01] there was a need or an
[54:03] unfulfillment okay and that's good amen
[54:07] okay what I want to say to you is that's
[54:10] what's keeping you
[54:18] saved do you know
[54:20] why because serp and Seed can't feel the
[54:24] need in their life so they don't come
[54:26] for prayer that's right and I don't I'm
[54:28] I'm saying this in a certain way cuz I
[54:31] want you to understand the effects of
[54:32] the Holy Ghost okay
[54:35] so what's keeping you saved is that you
[54:38] feel
[54:40] unworthy you feel you need help you feel
[54:44] you need to come up for prayer you feel
[54:47] you need more now all of those things
[54:50] the devil will make you think see you
[54:52] don't have the Holy Ghost see you're
[54:55] condemned see you're struggling see you
[54:58] did something wrong but I want to tell
[55:00] you
[55:04] something that's what's keeping you
[55:06] saved to your that's what's keeping you
[55:10] humble enough if you just realize this
[55:13] that's what's keeping you saved and in
[55:15] humility knowing that there's a thirst
[55:17] for more of God you couldn't have that
[55:20] thirst unless you had the Holy
[55:25] Ghost you see see somebody that doesn't
[55:27] have the Holy Ghost they think that God
[55:29] had made why do I go up for
[55:31] prayer
[55:35] amen does that make sense to
[55:38] you very often God does things in our
[55:41] lives and it doesn't it feels contrary
[55:44] to what we think our perspective should
[55:47] be very often you
[55:50] know the fact that you feel needy you
[55:53] should say Lord I thank God I feel needy
[55:56] amen the fact that you feel you need
[55:58] more you should thank God you feel
[56:02] more that is the Holy Ghost and you're
[56:05] not you know sometimes people are
[56:07] looking for something and what they're
[56:08] looking for is not what the reality is
[56:11] the fact that you've got the need and
[56:13] are aware you can feel the need is the
[56:16] evidence that God's in
[56:19] you
[56:21] Lord
[56:23] hallu Cain can't feel that yeah
[56:30] Cain can't feel
[56:33] that the Holy Ghost last night was here
[56:38] okay God was here man there's thick like
[56:41] fog and Faith was just working on all of
[56:44] us including me
[56:48] okay and the rejoicing and the feeling
[56:51] wasn't what the Holy Ghost really was
[56:53] that was the effect of it but the Bible
[56:56] says that when he the Holy Ghost comes
[56:59] he's going to do three things now I want
[57:02] you to listen for those of you that are
[57:05] struggling and thinking why am I don't
[57:08] have the Holy Ghost the Bible says the
[57:10] Holy Ghost can te things listen number
[57:13] one lead and guide you into all truth
[57:15] did he take us into truth last night
[57:17] amen amen number two bring things to
[57:21] your
[57:22] remembrance
[57:24] right you already knew I already knew
[57:27] what brother Brian was preaching about
[57:28] yesterday before the foundations of the
[57:30] world but when I came in my human flesh
[57:33] I forgot that when he started preaching
[57:35] it all came back to
[57:36] me it's called everybody listening yes
[57:40] it's called Remember
[57:43] yes amen hallelujah does that make sense
[57:47] yeah it's called re
[57:50] remember that means you knew it
[57:53] once and then in your flesh you couldn't
[57:56] contact it and now the Holy Ghost came
[57:58] to let us
[58:02] REM and what happened was was
[58:05] we
[58:07] recognized we
[58:09] recognized we knew Christ before we came
[58:12] here but now he came back and we
[58:14] recognize what we already forgot we
[58:17] knew that's right does that make sense
[58:19] to you see the Holy Ghost when he comes
[58:21] to lead and guide you into all truth
[58:23] check the
[58:24] mark the Holy Ghost will take and bring
[58:27] things to your remembrance amen is that
[58:30] right he'll bring things to your
[58:32] remembrance and then the Holy Ghost when
[58:35] he comes will show you things to
[58:39] come okay there's your measurement
[58:46] amen you don't have to feel
[58:54] something when the Lord opened the
[58:56] scriptures last night didn't he give us
[58:59] a type of what we're expecting to come
[59:02] didn't he lead and guide us in draw
[59:04] truth didn't he bring things back to our
[59:07] memory we were blessed last night see
[59:10] what I
[59:12] mean it's called restore restore
[59:17] hallelujah amen redeem right
[59:21] amen
[59:22] remember
[59:24] amen am that's what the word
[59:29] does all right
[59:32] now there's another thing that I'd like
[59:36] to address a little
[59:38] bit and that is this let's say brother
[59:42] Oscar went to his
[59:44] mailbox and he found out there's a $10
[59:47] million check written in Oscar's mailbox
[59:50] written to our brother
[59:53] Oscar we'd hear it all the way to
[59:55] Manitoba amen right brother
[1:00:00] Oscar okay now the point I'm making
[1:00:04] is a problem okay so brother Oscar
[1:00:08] Landing a million bucks in his mailbox
[1:00:10] is an
[1:00:11] event right amen I'd say it's a good one
[1:00:14] I'd say he deserves it he would have a
[1:00:16] golden sacks next
[1:00:18] time
[1:00:20] okay but what do we call a problem it's
[1:00:24] also an event right yeah okay the thing
[1:00:28] with the problem is it's an event with
[1:00:30] pain in it right okay now when brother
[1:00:33] Oscar has a million bucks in his in his
[1:00:36] uh mailbox he says buddy I'm paying free
[1:00:39] paying my house off I'm going to take
[1:00:41] and pay my machine off and we're going
[1:00:42] on holidays there's no pain in
[1:00:45] that the point I'm making is when we
[1:00:48] have what we call a problem is also an
[1:00:50] event and the difference between that
[1:00:53] event and what we call a problem is the
[1:00:55] pain in the event because we're pain
[1:01:01] avoiders we don't like
[1:01:06] pain
[1:01:08] okay it's the pain in the event that we
[1:01:11] want to avoid that's why we call it a
[1:01:15] problem okay what I'm telling you
[1:01:19] is God
[1:01:22] literally purposely puts problems and
[1:01:25] challenges is right in front of you that
[1:01:28] you have to
[1:01:30] face yes sir okay God does that he put
[1:01:35] things in front of you with pain in it
[1:01:38] that you have to face your flesh
[1:01:40] naturally wants to run away from the
[1:01:43] pain but to you that are facing problems
[1:01:47] let me tell you a hint
[1:01:49] okay enjoy the pain it's good stuff amen
[1:01:54] don't waste the pain
[1:01:57] very good don't waste the
[1:02:00] pain don't become a pain and voider
[1:02:04] don't get more
[1:02:09] religious don't lie to
[1:02:14] yourself don't try to avoid
[1:02:16] it don't downplay
[1:02:20] it let me give you a a hint as a a man
[1:02:24] that's made too many mistakes stakes and
[1:02:26] I got too many
[1:02:28] scars you need to learn to enjoy the
[1:02:31] pain it's good pain yes
[1:02:34] why it causes you to ask for truer
[1:02:40] answers number two it actually creates
[1:02:44] courage to do things you've never done
[1:02:46] before that's right the problem creates
[1:02:50] courage you need if God what do we do
[1:02:53] when we have a grade four student
[1:02:56] would put grade five problems in front
[1:02:59] of it
[1:03:01] right why you want them to grow up amen
[1:03:05] what happens when they're in grade five
[1:03:08] grade six and you struggle a year to
[1:03:11] overcome grade
[1:03:13] six what is causing you to grow
[1:03:18] spiritually you it's God literally
[1:03:23] challenging you to ask for better answer
[1:03:26] and enjoy the
[1:03:28] pain because Christ went to Calvary
[1:03:33] willingly to enjoy the pain so you and I
[1:03:36] could
[1:03:39] live okay does that make
[1:03:42] sense point I'm making is that for those
[1:03:46] some of you you don't think you have the
[1:03:48] Holy Ghost and need more of the Hol Holy
[1:03:50] Ghost let me say something to you the
[1:03:53] fact that there's that need in you is
[1:03:55] the EV Ence that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:57] already cuz you couldn't have that
[1:03:59] thirst if God wasn't in there amen so
[1:04:02] don't let the devil beat you up and say
[1:04:04] I'm condemned you're not condemned
[1:04:05] you're
[1:04:07] growing you're not condemned you're
[1:04:09] growing God hasn't thrown you away he
[1:04:11] sees
[1:04:12] you you know what I mean he sees
[1:04:16] you
[1:04:18] evil you want to write this down you can
[1:04:20] write this
[1:04:21] down evil always destroys the evidence
[1:04:25] that they're in need of spiritual
[1:04:30] growth why did Cain kill
[1:04:34] Abel cuz Abel was the evidence of what
[1:04:38] Cain was
[1:04:39] lacking does that make sense why did
[1:04:43] Pina Throw Dirt at Hannah yeah cuz
[1:04:47] Hannah had the worthy
[1:04:49] portion and Pina was throwing dirt at
[1:04:52] Hannah because Hannah was the evidence
[1:04:54] of what Pina laed
[1:04:56] amen okay
[1:04:59] evil always destroys the
[1:05:03] evidence that they are in need of
[1:05:06] spiritual
[1:05:08] growth okay so don't be surprised when
[1:05:12] some of your friends leave you what you
[1:05:14] call
[1:05:17] friends does that all make sense you
[1:05:19] only understood I want the people that
[1:05:22] came for prayer last night to Have
[1:05:24] Courage that was the
[1:05:26] evidence that God is with you the fact
[1:05:29] that you came for
[1:05:30] prayer
[1:05:34] Lord so the Holy Ghost when he comes
[1:05:37] you'll do three things I trust he comes
[1:05:41] today he'll do three things what will he
[1:05:44] do lead and guide you into all truth
[1:05:47] what the second thing he's going to do
[1:05:49] bring things to your remembrance what's
[1:05:51] the third thing he's going to do show
[1:05:53] you things to come
[1:06:08] amen trust that was
[1:06:11] okay I'd like to continue today
[1:06:14] on the evidence or the way of a true
[1:06:18] pastor and uh I really appreciated the
[1:06:22] conversation we had in the hotel room
[1:06:24] today and I got some
[1:06:26] texts
[1:06:27] today or last
[1:06:30] night and the whole thing all boils down
[1:06:34] to is the idea that pastorial ship to to
[1:06:38] be a good pastor and I had learned this
[1:06:41] kind of the hard way is Christ is the
[1:06:44] chief Pastor yeah underneath that is a
[1:06:47] pastor for the age that has to line the
[1:06:50] pastor for the age one time was going to
[1:06:52] go hunting and fishing and go to Alaska
[1:06:55] and then God put him right back in line
[1:06:56] one time and he told him the price he
[1:06:58] was going to pay if he wasn't going to
[1:06:59] get in line amen I sorry I should do it
[1:07:01] like this right Chief
[1:07:04] Shepherd the pastor for the age and one
[1:07:07] time brother Brandon said this is too
[1:07:09] hard I'm not going to do this the
[1:07:10] sacrifice is too much and he was going
[1:07:12] to go to the bush and said God when you
[1:07:14] need me call me and then I'll come back
[1:07:15] and God says boy you're going to he gave
[1:07:18] him he said listen you know that you
[1:07:19] know that old guy down there you'll be
[1:07:21] spitting Cod and your wife is going to
[1:07:23] leave you to get him back in line right
[1:07:25] okay you understand right so under that
[1:07:27] we have pastors to the church and under
[1:07:31] this we've got uh the the pastor uh of
[1:07:34] the family which is the father and under
[1:07:37] this we've got the the wife brother says
[1:07:39] the woman the the mother is also a
[1:07:41] pastor and under that we've got the
[1:07:42] children so the point of making is
[1:07:44] pastorial ship starts all the way from
[1:07:46] the top and goes all the way to the
[1:07:48] bottom okay so my point is is that if
[1:07:52] you're going to if you're uh you know
[1:07:56] I I brother Ron is the pastor here and I
[1:07:58] can tell what kind of brother uh Pastor
[1:08:00] brother Ron is by the evidence of how
[1:08:03] you treat Christ and it's the same thing
[1:08:06] with you and your family I'm a father
[1:08:09] and if you want to look how I've
[1:08:10] pastored look at my children all right
[1:08:12] it's the same thing amen and so the
[1:08:15] point I'm trying to make is we're all
[1:08:16] responsible for all staying in that now
[1:08:19] listen we can't always get the results
[1:08:21] we want and I get that because listen
[1:08:23] when me and brother Ron were teenag we'd
[1:08:26] never even had a dad in our life period
[1:08:29] you know and the dad we had knew nothing
[1:08:30] about Redemption I mean zero now some of
[1:08:34] you kids been raised on message Pew and
[1:08:36] I just going to tell you this and you
[1:08:38] won't understand this but you don't know
[1:08:39] how lucky you
[1:08:41] are you know you I I know you don't
[1:08:43] understand that but the point of it is
[1:08:45] I'll tell you anyway when brother Ron
[1:08:47] and I were kids we never had a dad that
[1:08:49] cared for our soul that's right we had
[1:08:52] to learn that from our heavenly father
[1:08:54] when we quit looking at our Earthly
[1:08:56] father and turned her eyes to the
[1:08:58] heavenly father and that's what Isaiah
[1:09:01] had to do Isaiah was looking at the king
[1:09:04] and he was so respecting the king but he
[1:09:06] was taking getting influence on a
[1:09:09] horizontal horizontal level and then God
[1:09:12] had to break that thing and God caused
[1:09:15] that King to fall and then Isaiah had to
[1:09:17] look up and now he's all the real King
[1:09:21] hallu action reverence humility in how
[1:09:24] they behave in the house of God because
[1:09:26] his Earthly King had denied the house of
[1:09:29] God so sometimes you got to get your
[1:09:31] eyes off of your Earthly father and get
[1:09:33] it back to the heavenly father so you
[1:09:35] can be in line for
[1:09:40] Redemption
[1:09:41] okay you know some of you you were like
[1:09:44] me and brother Ron and many others we
[1:09:46] never had a dad that adopted
[1:09:50] us and the fact of it is they
[1:09:53] couldn't they they they're their their
[1:09:55] their spiritual bank accounts were empty
[1:09:57] they had nothing to give us you know you
[1:09:59] know what I mean that way because you
[1:10:00] have to be willing able Kinsmen right
[1:10:05] and they couldn't so we got a real
[1:10:08] adoption when we start one time I had a
[1:10:10] youth camp and I and I gave all I had
[1:10:13] about nine young men in the front row
[1:10:15] and I gave them a pen and paper said I
[1:10:17] want you to describe God to me so I gave
[1:10:19] me a pen and a paper and they started
[1:10:20] writing God is this God is that God is
[1:10:22] that and I gave and I took all their
[1:10:24] papers back and started reading it I had
[1:10:26] nine different gods
[1:10:29] amen wow yeah they're all describing
[1:10:33] their
[1:10:43] dad so the inspiration of our pastorial
[1:10:47] ship comes through adoption to our
[1:10:49] Heavenly Father that's all I'm going to
[1:10:51] say
[1:10:53] okay so if we go a little bit
[1:10:57] further without getting into too many
[1:10:59] details and this is where I get all
[1:11:00] messed up because after he preached
[1:11:02] yesterday I was really messed
[1:11:06] up but I'd like to take the thought of
[1:11:08] the seven seal yeah effect and the
[1:11:12] opportunity and the gap of that seven
[1:11:14] seal because I want to go to the Book of
[1:11:17] Esther and I want to speak about moving
[1:11:20] because remember Esther moved from Moab
[1:11:23] all the way to the field and then on the
[1:11:25] way she had a was introduced to the
[1:11:27] chief Reaper and then finally to boas so
[1:11:30] she went through four
[1:11:31] stages Point number two I want to make
[1:11:34] is this that it was Naomi that could
[1:11:36] bring her to the first three and bring
[1:11:39] her right to Boaz but Naomi did not take
[1:11:43] no Authority once she hit the thrashing
[1:11:45] floor at Boaz cuz she said Naomi said
[1:11:49] when you get to the threshing floor She
[1:11:52] said now you do what he says yeah she
[1:11:56] knew her parenting was
[1:11:58] done if I can use that word okay but
[1:12:02] Naomi's mission in life was to get Ruth
[1:12:05] to that threshing floor so that her job
[1:12:09] could be finished and I know brother Ron
[1:12:12] and I know me my job and Ron's job is
[1:12:15] get you to Christ then finally we can
[1:12:17] rest
[1:12:22] amen these preachers that want to
[1:12:24] develop dependency on the preachers
[1:12:26] they're fools oh yes I ain't got enough
[1:12:29] energy for that I'm way too tired for
[1:12:40] that let me say it like
[1:12:43] this
[1:12:46] Naomi genuinely
[1:12:49] loved
[1:12:51] Ruth and was concerned about her
[1:12:55] spiritual growth to hand her
[1:12:58] off
[1:13:00] okay Naomi was not an insecure
[1:13:04] person Naomi didn't need Ruth depending
[1:13:08] on her just to make Naomi feel
[1:13:12] good now I'm going to use some words but
[1:13:15] and you'll understand Naomi was Ruth's
[1:13:18] first
[1:13:22] pastor but the job of the first pastor
[1:13:25] pastors get you to the second
[1:13:28] Pastor that's
[1:13:29] right you
[1:13:31] parents are your kids's first
[1:13:35] pastor but your job is to get your kids
[1:13:37] to the second Pastor which is
[1:13:41] Christ very good you understand yes
[1:13:45] amen there's two classes of oil in Luke
[1:13:48] 20 Matthew 25 everybody when they heard
[1:13:52] the bridegroom oh boy see I don't want
[1:13:53] to preach I just
[1:14:12] come everybody heard the bridegroom call
[1:14:15] under the seventh
[1:14:18] dispensation everybody rolls up whoa the
[1:14:23] bridegroom's coming yeah yeah but
[1:14:26] there's two classes of oil true the
[1:14:28] first class of oil runs out
[1:14:31] yeah it's only the second class of oil
[1:14:34] that brings you to your
[1:14:36] groom Hallelujah does that make sense
[1:14:39] you
[1:14:45] understand everybody said whoa God sent
[1:14:48] a prophet
[1:14:50] whoa but eventually that runs
[1:14:54] out that should lead you to the second
[1:14:57] oil the Holy
[1:14:59] Ghost is what that should
[1:15:02] do see amen and
[1:15:06] so we find out that true pastoral
[1:15:11] ship is not creating a
[1:15:15] dependency like Naomi didn't create a
[1:15:18] dependency where she said Ruth you
[1:15:19] depend on
[1:15:21] me
[1:15:23] right boy brother osar now we're back at
[1:15:25] that topic you and I talked
[1:15:28] about a
[1:15:30] dependency can look like love but it's
[1:15:33] as evil as the day is long that's
[1:15:40] right Ruth was not an insecure person
[1:15:43] she didn't need to be fed to somebody to
[1:15:46] feed the insecurity
[1:15:48] yeah does that make sense you understand
[1:15:51] now Ruth was secure enough
[1:15:55] to be concerned about Ruth's uh Naomi
[1:15:58] was secure enough to be concerned about
[1:16:02] Ruth's spiritual growth and at a certain
[1:16:05] spot Naomi knew she had to take her
[1:16:06] hands
[1:16:08] off she was not an insecure person to
[1:16:12] create a
[1:16:13] dependency and I'll tell you something
[1:16:15] else I've learned people that think that
[1:16:18] dependency is is Love Actually if you
[1:16:20] look at it a dependency is very evil
[1:16:23] because a dependence Y is when you have
[1:16:25] one person that's spiritually
[1:16:27] sick and they find another person it's
[1:16:30] amazing how they find each others
[1:16:32] another person that's spiritually sick
[1:16:35] and then this person feeds that
[1:16:37] spiritual sickness and this person feeds
[1:16:39] that one and boy there's a strong bond
[1:16:42] together you ever get between those
[1:16:43] people they'll bite your head off
[1:16:45] because they think that you're
[1:16:46] destroying something the point I'm
[1:16:48] making if it's God's love God's depended
[1:16:50] on spiritual growth because if you love
[1:16:54] somebody you want them to grow
[1:16:55] spiritually without
[1:16:58] you man I wish I could somehow I don't
[1:17:01] want to get down down that role but if I
[1:17:03] could get you so often you have people
[1:17:06] or families or churches you have an
[1:17:08] insecure Pastor behind let's do the
[1:17:10] church level you can I don't care you
[1:17:12] can go any level you want the point is
[1:17:14] you can have an insecure pastor and he
[1:17:17] has an insecurity inside of him and he's
[1:17:21] looking to see if the congregation is
[1:17:23] insecure enough that they that they'll
[1:17:26] are dependent on him well he's dependent
[1:17:28] on them they're dependent on him and
[1:17:31] they love each others and they'll do
[1:17:32] stuff for each others and they'll work
[1:17:34] for each others and my goodness looks so
[1:17:36] tight the whole thing is
[1:17:46] evil the whole thing is
[1:17:48] evil because what the pastor is saying
[1:17:51] is I'm going to keep you spiritually
[1:17:52] sick so I can stay spiritually sick so
[1:17:54] we can can look like a
[1:18:16] church agapy love is based on spiritual
[1:18:19] growth not a
[1:18:23] dependency the last thing I want is my
[1:18:26] church people to be depending on
[1:18:29] me the last thing I
[1:18:34] want and if I hang on to them and create
[1:18:38] insecurities and remind them how they
[1:18:39] need me and how they failure and they
[1:18:41] need me and you can't go to heaven
[1:18:43] without me I'm as evil as the you can
[1:18:45] quote scriptures and quote message and
[1:18:47] still be flat out
[1:18:53] evil
[1:18:57] but
[1:18:59] Naomi she had no
[1:19:02] insecurities she pulled Ruth out of the
[1:19:06] world brought her into boaz's
[1:19:10] field
[1:19:12] ah let me idle there a little
[1:19:17] bit Naomi didn't have to re-register the
[1:19:21] field yes amen the field was was already
[1:19:26] good you know what I mean that way yeah
[1:19:29] because before Naomi brought Ruth to the
[1:19:31] field what they don't know is the chief
[1:19:35] Shepherd before the first Harvester got
[1:19:39] there Boaz already went into the field
[1:19:41] and he grabbed that barley and he was
[1:19:43] going like this and checking to see if
[1:19:45] it was right Boaz already registered the
[1:19:48] field we don't have to re-register the
[1:19:50] message man good night do you see what I
[1:19:53] mean boad has already been here this is
[1:19:56] his field this is certified seed and
[1:19:59] Naomi doesn't go and check to see if the
[1:20:02] field is good for Ruth to come into are
[1:20:04] you kidding you're going to go and
[1:20:06] register this message are you kidding to
[1:20:08] me that'd be like the little that little
[1:20:12] that little lamb trying to protect the
[1:20:14] lion can you imagine give me a break the
[1:20:16] lion don't need
[1:20:17] protecting that's
[1:20:22] good what I'm trying to say is
[1:20:25] I don't need to defend this message oh
[1:20:27] Lord boy boy don't don't do this to
[1:20:31] me praise the
[1:20:35] Lord I don't have to defend this message
[1:20:38] it defends
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:43] me I don't have to re-register the
[1:20:51] seed you know what brother BR said you
[1:20:54] know what what Eve's fall
[1:20:56] was one place brother says Eve fell
[1:21:00] because she wanted to protect the
[1:21:06] truth I got a question yeah I got a
[1:21:09] question for you right I have thought in
[1:21:12] my younger years I'm the defender of the
[1:21:14] faith and I'm going to protect this
[1:21:17] message that was Cockiness that's what
[1:21:20] that
[1:21:22] was you know what's wrong with sending
[1:21:24] this
[1:21:26] message I'll tell you what's wrong with
[1:21:28] it it's not what you're doing it's your
[1:21:30] position here's the message right if you
[1:21:34] say you're going to protect this message
[1:21:36] you've placed yourself above it are you
[1:21:38] kidding me right we're supposed to be
[1:21:41] under
[1:21:43] it not above it who do you think you
[1:21:48] are it's not what you're doing it's not
[1:21:51] your intention but it's your
[1:21:53] position that putting yourself
[1:21:58] into
[1:22:01] so
[1:22:03] Boaz Naomi knows enough about
[1:22:07] scripture that she knows cuz remember
[1:22:11] Naomi has has the right bloodline in her
[1:22:14] but she needs also a place for a woman
[1:22:17] to be able to for the inheritance okay
[1:22:18] now let me boy see you get to these
[1:22:20] topics okay they didn't have Richie
[1:22:23] Brothers in the those
[1:22:27] days there was no Richie
[1:22:30] Brothers what I'm saying is this day and
[1:22:34] age a farmer Farms all his life and then
[1:22:37] after that he sells his machinery and
[1:22:40] then he takes all his machinery and puts
[1:22:42] it for auction on Richie Brothers but in
[1:22:44] those days the farm never went to Richie
[1:22:47] Brothers it went to your oldest son
[1:22:50] inheritance got it you never got out of
[1:22:52] your inheritance you passed along to
[1:22:54] your son that's why you want to make
[1:22:56] sure your son was a v married a virgin
[1:22:58] because she's going to be part of your
[1:23:00] inheritance boy now I could go to
[1:23:02] Deuteronomy 22 but the point I'm making
[1:23:04] is God has an interest in your condition
[1:23:08] cuz you're going to be have the benefit
[1:23:10] of be carrying on The Inheritance am
[1:23:13] that's why God's concerned about what
[1:23:14] you think concerned about what you
[1:23:16] believe concerned about what church you
[1:23:18] go through he's trying to keep you a
[1:23:20] virgin pure to the word because you're
[1:23:22] going to be the beneficiary of eternal
[1:23:26] life this is not about you oh by the way
[1:23:30] this is not about you this is about him
[1:23:33] that's why he's keeping you
[1:23:38] cleanall it ain't about
[1:23:40] you it's about
[1:23:42] him but you and I have the
[1:23:48] privilege for us Amen to be part of his
[1:23:52] inheritance when we were born by sex
[1:23:54] amen when we we were born we're all
[1:23:56] disqualified for inheritance but praise
[1:23:59] the Lord you can be born out of your sex
[1:24:02] birth and come to a spoken word
[1:24:05] birth reborn not by sex by the spoken
[1:24:10] word sir you can go to church but what
[1:24:13] are you doing about your sex birth you
[1:24:15] can play specials what are you doing
[1:24:17] about your sex birth you can take and
[1:24:19] dress right what are you doing about
[1:24:21] your sex birth I'll tell you something
[1:24:23] we need somebody that wasn't born by sex
[1:24:25] to reach down and grab a sex born man
[1:24:29] and haul him up we need
[1:24:46] Christ The Inheritance what Adam
[1:24:50] lost marriage is not a
[1:24:53] right is it's a privilege yes
[1:24:57] sir amen definitely I don't want to go
[1:25:00] down too many rabbit Trails cuz I know
[1:25:01] where I want to get to hopefully I'm in
[1:25:04] slide number two out of
[1:25:06] 15
[1:25:10] God marriage is a
[1:25:13] privilege of
[1:25:17] redemption it's like your driver's
[1:25:19] license you think your driver's license
[1:25:21] are right no you go ahead and speed too
[1:25:24] many many times and you'll find out it's
[1:25:25] not your driver's
[1:25:27] license your driver's license is a
[1:25:31] privilege right and your driver's
[1:25:33] license to Heaven is a privilege
[1:25:40] also you say this is all about
[1:25:43] me I got news for
[1:25:47] you this is all about what God put in
[1:25:51] you not you that's right
[1:26:01] so Naomi wasn't insecure yeah she could
[1:26:06] easily tell Ruth listen when you get to
[1:26:08] that threshing floor watch her comeand
[1:26:10] she says now from here on in you do what
[1:26:14] he says
[1:26:18] good
[1:26:20] so the way of a true pastor pastoring
[1:26:25] is not
[1:26:27] dependency pastoring is the ability to
[1:26:31] let go and give
[1:26:35] God and
[1:26:37] Boaz because Naomi knew she was a Jew
[1:26:41] she knew the cycles and the traditions
[1:26:44] of redemption and and land title rights
[1:26:47] and all that now oh boy you know what
[1:26:50] this is just too much but let me just
[1:26:52] say it like this okay now Naomi knew she
[1:26:55] was looking for a time when boas would
[1:26:58] be in
[1:27:00] transition and she knew that that would
[1:27:02] be boaz's weak spot is when he would be
[1:27:06] in
[1:27:07] transition because remember brother
[1:27:09] brandom says and it's so beautiful Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ left his father's Throne to move
[1:27:17] to his own throne but we know that he
[1:27:20] didn't want to go to his own Throne wife
[1:27:26] right so there is right in that
[1:27:30] transition when there's
[1:27:34] opportunity so the point I'm making is
[1:27:36] is that Boaz was in transition and when
[1:27:39] she saw Boaz go from the field and then
[1:27:43] head off to the Garner something inside
[1:27:46] of her said it's harvest time yeah we've
[1:27:49] got opportunity here and I find this so
[1:27:53] fascinating
[1:27:54] I find this so fascinating because uh
[1:27:58] because uh Naomi she knew that there
[1:28:02] would have to be a a transition from the
[1:28:06] feet to the side yeah
[1:28:10] amen Naomi didn't tell oh you know I
[1:28:14] don't know you know what I mean I don't
[1:28:19] know Naomi knew enough to know that the
[1:28:23] way to to boaz's side was through his
[1:28:29] feet and for those of you that don't
[1:28:31] take foot washing you should
[1:28:36] listen the way Adam took his wife out of
[1:28:40] his
[1:28:42] side right the wife is by the husband's
[1:28:46] side yeah right but the way to the side
[1:28:50] is through the feet
[1:28:53] yes
[1:28:54] the way to the incense altar where the
[1:28:57] seventh seal takes place is through the
[1:29:00] brass
[1:29:02] altar you have to go to the Brass altar
[1:29:05] first and recognize your
[1:29:08] worthlessness and recognize you need
[1:29:13] him that has to happen at the brass
[1:29:19] altar understand because the same fire
[1:29:25] there's a Divine link between the brass
[1:29:27] Altar and the incense altar because the
[1:29:29] fire on the incense altar actually came
[1:29:32] from the brass altar so they had and the
[1:29:35] fire the fire on the brass altar came
[1:29:37] from God so God took and LIF the brass
[1:29:40] altar that same fire got translated all
[1:29:44] the way to the incense altar amen got it
[1:29:47] now and you can't be a priest and
[1:29:50] offering at the incense altar unless you
[1:29:52] come through the brass altar what I'm
[1:29:54] trying to say is that that say there's a
[1:29:57] link between Jesus Christ blood 2,000
[1:30:01] years ago at the brass altar all the way
[1:30:05] to the incense altar when Revelations
[1:30:07] opened up the same blood that was there
[1:30:10] 2,000 years ago came in our generation
[1:30:13] one more time because there's a Divine
[1:30:15] link between Calvary and what happened
[1:30:18] in our generation but you can't get to
[1:30:21] our generation till you understand what
[1:30:24] the brass altar represents for
[1:30:26] you
[1:30:32] beautiful and another
[1:30:35] thing when you get at boaz's feet no the
[1:30:39] feet are
[1:30:41] here here's boaz's
[1:30:44] feet here's boaz's side he's laying all
[1:30:47] across
[1:30:49] this
[1:30:52] stage
[1:30:54] here's
[1:30:55] Calvary
[1:31:00] Hallelujah over
[1:31:03] here is Revelations
[1:31:07] 8 the same thing that open Calvary open
[1:31:10] up Revelations
[1:31:12] 8 you can't get to Revelations 8 unless
[1:31:15] you understand what happened at Calvary
[1:31:17] that you are Justified not by what you
[1:31:20] do but what his blood justifies you and
[1:31:24] part of the same fire that was at the
[1:31:27] brass altar is the same fire they used
[1:31:30] when all the prayers of the saints were
[1:31:37] collected but not Boaz was in
[1:31:41] transition coming off the
[1:31:44] field and now he's going to be the
[1:31:46] reaper the same one that slded the seed
[1:31:48] is the same one that does the reaping
[1:31:52] right so the same one that SS the field
[1:31:55] in his field let it grow up and
[1:31:57] certified his field and he's the same
[1:31:59] one that does the reaping
[1:32:01] amen and Ruth had the
[1:32:04] privilege of being part of this process
[1:32:11] undeservedly now think of it think of
[1:32:14] it once he gets to the threshing
[1:32:19] floor and then Ruth lands and Nomo boy
[1:32:24] thank God for Naomi
[1:32:27] amen do you know that the way you treat
[1:32:30] your first Pastor the way you're going
[1:32:31] to treat your second one
[1:32:35] true
[1:32:37] girls your relations with your dad yeah
[1:32:41] 90% will be the same relationship with
[1:32:43] you have your
[1:32:45] husband your dad was your first
[1:32:48] pastor and your husband's your second
[1:32:51] pastor and there's more than once that
[1:32:53] I've been marriage counseling and I said
[1:32:55] I need you first to go make it right
[1:32:57] with your
[1:32:58] dad because if you don't make it right
[1:33:00] with your dad you're going to bring the
[1:33:02] same
[1:33:03] thing into your
[1:33:10] marriage do you
[1:33:13] know the way you treat be brother Ron is
[1:33:16] probably how you treat
[1:33:20] Christ you disrespect his office yeah
[1:33:24] you may not like him but don't
[1:33:26] disrespect his
[1:33:28] office cuz that is what'll carry you to
[1:33:31] Christ amen very good does that make
[1:33:33] sense you understand the principles now
[1:33:36] amen that's right okay I told my church
[1:33:39] they don't have to like me but they all
[1:33:40] have to ride horses cuz in Revelation 19
[1:33:42] you got to ride horses so you need me
[1:33:44] anyways but you may not like me but
[1:33:46] you're going to take riding lessons from
[1:33:48] me that you are going to do that's
[1:33:52] scriptural
[1:34:00] I told him they you know I told
[1:34:03] them look if you get to Revelations 19
[1:34:06] fall off your horse don't blame
[1:34:19] me but when Boaz starts to transition
[1:34:22] from the seven Church ages
[1:34:25] and now he's stepping on the threshing
[1:34:27] floor that represents opportunity for
[1:34:30] the
[1:34:32] woman and so the point I want to make is
[1:34:35] that there's a threshing floor exchange
[1:34:38] and I'm going to end up with this
[1:34:39] because it's taking too long but there's
[1:34:41] a pattern that needs to follow after the
[1:34:43] chief Shepherd and you'll find that in
[1:34:46] Scriptures it says and for their sakes I
[1:34:49] sanctify myself that they also may be
[1:34:52] Sanctified but listen listen for their
[1:34:55] sakes I sanctify myself that they may
[1:34:57] also Sanctified but let's watch the next
[1:35:00] word through the truth it's the truth
[1:35:03] that sanctifies you not Eugene Brown and
[1:35:06] not Ron Peterson it's the truth that
[1:35:09] sanctifies you but the other side is
[1:35:11] also true that as a father I have to
[1:35:14] make a sacrifice so that my kids can be
[1:35:18] Sanctified through the
[1:35:19] truth amen amen as a father
[1:35:24] because only a father can bring a girl
[1:35:26] to
[1:35:28] Womanhood and only a father can bring a
[1:35:30] boy to
[1:35:32] manhood and if there's anything we're
[1:35:34] lacking in our generation we lack
[1:35:37] men and the women are strong because the
[1:35:39] men are
[1:35:40] weak if the men were strong we'd have
[1:35:44] strong women for the right reason
[1:35:46] supporting their husband but the reason
[1:35:48] sometimes you have houses where the
[1:35:50] woman is expected to be the spiritual
[1:35:52] leader is because she can't find
[1:35:54] something to respect in that
[1:35:57] man and the man is dependent on the
[1:36:00] woman for completion the man should
[1:36:03] depend on Christ for completion not the
[1:36:05] woman we went through that yesterday you
[1:36:08] understand and why would a woman trust a
[1:36:11] man when the woman can control the man
[1:36:13] he's not worth
[1:36:22] trusting
[1:36:28] gen boy Ron I don't know how far take
[1:36:31] this
[1:36:45] now you know what these churches that
[1:36:48] try to control their
[1:36:51] Pastor that man's not worth following if
[1:36:54] he falls for
[1:36:59] that do you
[1:37:12] understand a woman is looking for
[1:37:14] somebody stronger than
[1:37:22] her
[1:37:25] not for somebody she can control right
[1:37:29] she doesn't want the leadership yeah
[1:37:32] she's born to want to have a ruler born
[1:37:35] to want to have a head born to want to
[1:37:38] have somebody she can trust born to have
[1:37:40] some she can admire that came from the
[1:37:42] fall the last thing she wants is a
[1:37:44] husband that she can
[1:37:50] control
[1:37:52] d
[1:37:55] amen but if the man is going to a woman
[1:38:00] to find manhood he's in
[1:38:02] trouble because a woman can't bring a
[1:38:04] boy to manhood only the heavenly father
[1:38:06] can do
[1:38:16] that this principle applies all the way
[1:38:20] down the line because the authority fig
[1:38:23] is responsible for the
[1:38:25] relationship to the subjective figure
[1:38:28] and Christ is responsible for the
[1:38:30] relationship to the bride The Messengers
[1:38:33] responsible to the relationship for the
[1:38:35] age the pastors responsible for the
[1:38:37] relationship to the church the parents
[1:38:39] are responsible to the relationship to
[1:38:41] the to the children and it all comes
[1:38:43] down to one verse and behold the third I
[1:38:46] come to you ready to come and I'll not
[1:38:48] be burdensome to you for I come not to
[1:38:51] for to seek yours but but I come for you
[1:38:55] amen
[1:38:56] amen watch the children ought not to lay
[1:39:00] up for the
[1:39:05] parents the parents should lay up for
[1:39:07] the
[1:39:08] children brother
[1:39:11] amen so I'm talking about the way of a
[1:39:15] true
[1:39:16] Shepherd and I want to just put this in
[1:39:19] you know the Bible says for the word of
[1:39:21] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[1:39:23] than any two edged sword piercing even
[1:39:26] dividing a sun of the soul and the
[1:39:27] spirit and of the joint of the marrow
[1:39:30] and the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:39:31] the inent and the intense of the heart
[1:39:33] let me just say this when you read your
[1:39:36] Bible I got news for you when you read
[1:39:39] your Bible and you think oh look at this
[1:39:41] look at this look at this and then you
[1:39:42] do this look at this look I got new for
[1:39:44] you you think you're Discerning the
[1:39:46] Bible the truth of it is this Bible is
[1:39:48] Discerning
[1:39:50] you this Bible is Discerning you amen
[1:39:55] because this is a
[1:39:59] discerner makes
[1:40:01] sense so the point I'm making is this
[1:40:05] that there's a movement where when the
[1:40:08] brother bam says when the lamb came to
[1:40:10] be slay it came forth to do what to make
[1:40:12] his claims of redemption oh my I don't
[1:40:15] just feel like going over in a corner
[1:40:17] and sitting down crying a while here
[1:40:19] comes the lamb still bloody and John
[1:40:21] there wasn't nothing there all the
[1:40:23] celebrity was standing around but there
[1:40:24] was nothing that could do it there was
[1:40:26] no lamb now his
[1:40:28] intercessory days uh his intercessory
[1:40:31] days uh are over the mediation days and
[1:40:35] that's when the Angels going to stand
[1:40:37] there you wait till we get to the seals
[1:40:39] and at that time will'll be no more
[1:40:41] that's right there's a half hour silence
[1:40:43] watch what takes place in the half hour
[1:40:44] silence when that seven seal next Sunday
[1:40:47] Lord willing what I'm trying to say to
[1:40:49] you is when the day came that Bo as his
[1:40:51] intercession days were over and now Bo
[1:40:54] is changing position to come and claim
[1:40:57] what he had sown what's the use oh boy
[1:41:00] boy what's the use of Swing something if
[1:41:02] you don't go claim it so he's the one
[1:41:05] that sold he's the one that claims what
[1:41:08] brother man says Revelations 5 the most
[1:41:10] Sublime act in all of scripture now you
[1:41:14] would think it was Calvary Calvary was
[1:41:16] great something was sewing but what's
[1:41:19] the use of sewing and paying for
[1:41:22] something if you're not going to go and
[1:41:23] claim it this is
[1:41:26] mine what do you think happen in this
[1:41:28] generation he's claiming you cuz you're
[1:41:31] his he paid for you 2,000 years ago but
[1:41:35] what good is that is looking back there
[1:41:37] when you purchased and missing when he's
[1:41:39] coming today to say You're Mine you're
[1:41:42] mine you're mine you're mine I'm calling
[1:41:45] your name your name and what brother
[1:41:46] Brian did such a beautiful job yesterday
[1:41:49] how does God call your name he takes the
[1:41:52] Bible he opens a mystery you see the
[1:41:55] mystery that is the calling of your
[1:42:01] nameall the
[1:42:05] Lord you know why you could be
[1:42:08] called because you've been
[1:42:11] sewing if you're not here here in your
[1:42:14] name today that is the evidence you
[1:42:16] never were
[1:42:19] sewing
[1:42:21] amen I was think thinking yesterday
[1:42:23] brother Brian is preaching and he's
[1:42:25] going along all of that and stuff and
[1:42:27] he's got this in this hand and this in
[1:42:29] this hand and he's going out there like
[1:42:31] an African you
[1:42:35] [Applause]
[1:42:36] know and I'm
[1:42:38] thinking yesterday I didn't I didn't
[1:42:41] hear
[1:42:44] e
[1:42:47] e you yeah I never heard that yesterday
[1:42:51] you never heard yesterday you did
[1:42:55] e
[1:42:57] e that's what I heard
[1:42:59] yesterday loud and
[1:43:03] clear
[1:43:09] Glory from an
[1:43:16] African I don't have the time here it's
[1:43:21] 12:36 come on
[1:43:28] Naomi was the first Pastor that leads to
[1:43:30] the second Pastor
[1:43:33] yeah you can't teach somebody you can't
[1:43:37] gain respect from
[1:43:43] first so do
[1:43:48] I people that don't can't respect you
[1:43:51] are unteachable correct
[1:43:56] you can't teach somebody
[1:44:00] until you can gain
[1:44:03] respect
[1:44:09] first why is Ephesians 5 so beautiful
[1:44:14] Ephesians 5 remember what I told
[1:44:16] yesterday a marriage is not man or woman
[1:44:18] living in a house blah blah blah a
[1:44:20] marriage is a
[1:44:21] mystery of Redemption an active
[1:44:25] ingredient that must be in your marriage
[1:44:27] yeah right so the mystery of redemption
[1:44:30] is got to be an active ingredient in
[1:44:32] your redemption in other words the
[1:44:33] husband has to redeem the
[1:44:36] wife so that the children can be clean
[1:44:39] right I don't want to get into that but
[1:44:40] there's a whole thing to that but if you
[1:44:42] go to the last verse the Bible says and
[1:44:45] husbands you know I was listening to you
[1:44:48] I I I listened to my church this morning
[1:44:51] and you can just see it the Bible says
[1:44:53] husbands love your wives then the Bible
[1:44:57] says and wives respect your husband and
[1:45:03] I love that mystery because you know for
[1:45:05] a husband to love his wife is not
[1:45:09] natural we would rather respect her than
[1:45:13] love her gu that's our
[1:45:15] language and a wife is not natural for
[1:45:19] her to respect her husband she would
[1:45:22] rather love her husband cuz that's her
[1:45:25] love language
[1:45:27] right now I'm getting
[1:45:31] mhm I listen to my church this morning
[1:45:35] typical woman right I love you
[1:45:38] Lord you're wonderful I love you Lord
[1:45:42] you're
[1:45:43] amazing I never heard nobody say I
[1:45:45] respect you
[1:45:49] God it's our language yeah and that's
[1:45:52] it's okay
[1:45:55] yeah I hope you're getting this yeah
[1:45:57] yeah but what's the use of trying to
[1:45:59] love your husband if you disrespect him
[1:46:02] and won't take
[1:46:04] communion won't pay
[1:46:06] tithe won't wash feet your love is
[1:46:11] zero if you don't have respect
[1:46:14] first amen make sense it's written right
[1:46:17] in Ephesians
[1:46:19] 5 I think God deserves some respect and
[1:46:22] honor that's what I I
[1:46:24] think that's what I
[1:46:28] think respect is the foundation of all
[1:46:31] teaching and Naomi earned Ruth's respect
[1:46:36] yeah for Ruth to be able to learn from
[1:46:40] Naomi say that again Naomi
[1:46:44] earned Ruth's
[1:46:46] respect for Naomi to be able to learn or
[1:46:50] Ruth to be able to learn anything from
[1:46:52] Naomi
[1:46:56] makes sense you understand that's what's
[1:46:58] wrong with our school system these days
[1:46:59] they're supposed to teach kids they got
[1:47:01] no respect and honor how you going to
[1:47:02] teach them
[1:47:04] anything when as soon as they complain
[1:47:06] they run home to the parents and the
[1:47:08] teacher gets sued yeah are you kidding
[1:47:10] me that whole generation of Devil's
[1:47:12] coming up that's
[1:47:16] what's Ruth was humble enough to follow
[1:47:19] instructions yes think about it humble
[1:47:22] enough amen Ruth was humble enough to
[1:47:24] follow instructions I'm G to say it
[1:47:26] again Ruth was humble enough to follow
[1:47:29] instructions do you know when the angel
[1:47:31] came to Sam Samson's mom the angel came
[1:47:34] with specific instructions how to raise
[1:47:37] that child that's right that's right got
[1:47:39] it right do you know that when you got
[1:47:42] children you you better not raise them
[1:47:44] your
[1:47:45] way because God a specific instruction
[1:47:48] for you how to raise your child God it
[1:47:51] don't we got no right
[1:47:53] to raise children our way I don't care

[1:49:54] to Esther our Book of Ruth and I'm going
[1:49:58] to close cuz
[1:50:00] we're I smell what was happening back
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:12] there remember when he the Holy Ghost
[1:50:15] comes what's he going to do three things
[1:50:18] number one lead and guide you into all
[1:50:20] truth number two bring things back to
[1:50:23] your remembrance number three show you
[1:50:25] things that God's got in store for you
[1:50:28] amen right now the Book of Ruth first of
[1:50:32] all I want you to understand how God
[1:50:35] scripturally place has a mystery in the
[1:50:38] placing of the book yeah okay forget
[1:50:41] about the book Now watch how God placed
[1:50:44] the Book of Ruth yeah CU remember if you
[1:50:48] go to Judges chapter 21 in the last
[1:50:50] verse in those days there was no no king
[1:50:53] in Israel every man did what that was
[1:50:55] right in his own eyes now go to the
[1:50:57] chapter 1 verse one came to pass in the
[1:51:00] last in the days of the judges ruled
[1:51:02] that there was famine in the land so
[1:51:04] what I want you to understand was the
[1:51:06] Book of Ruth becomes the mystery in the
[1:51:09] famine at the end of the judges yes sir
[1:51:12] but I want you to notice this that it
[1:51:14] starts off in the days of Moses cuz
[1:51:16] Moses brought them all the way to the
[1:51:18] river
[1:51:21] yeah
[1:51:23] hallu the Moses dispensation had ended
[1:51:28] yeah what's the first thing that Joshua
[1:51:31] did when he crossed the river he had an
[1:51:33] angel visit yeah but what's the first
[1:51:35] thing he did he opened up the Seven
[1:51:37] Seals and seven Church ages because when
[1:51:38] he went around uh the city seven times
[1:51:41] and then and so forth you know that was
[1:51:43] the type of the seven opening of those
[1:51:45] Seven Seals and seven Church ages to do
[1:51:48] do what to release a Rahab amen
[1:51:53] all right now we're in 63 in March if
[1:51:55] you want to do a timeline yeah what are
[1:51:57] the Seals going to do they're going to
[1:51:59] release aab oh boy now we're going to
[1:52:02] get into something and Al brother he did
[1:52:04] such a good job yesterday but let me add
[1:52:06] something you know what happened was it
[1:52:08] had to release a Rahab so if they would
[1:52:11] the seals the opening of those seals
[1:52:13] released a Rahab because the token and
[1:52:15] so forth but it want you to notice
[1:52:17] something that wasn't the end of Rahab
[1:52:19] at the end of the day Rahab was
[1:52:23] predestinated to be in the lineage of
[1:52:25] redemption but it gets better than that
[1:52:28] she had had so many husbands and so many
[1:52:31] uh Witnesses of what her lifestyle was
[1:52:34] so God decided to fix this thing so he
[1:52:37] destroyed all the witnesses and when
[1:52:39] somebody tried to say RAB you can't
[1:52:42] marry salmone he asked where's your
[1:52:44] Witnesses they in ashes and all the
[1:52:47] witnesses of your formal life will be in
[1:52:50] ashes one day and you'll have no
[1:52:52] Witnesses against your marriage to the
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:52:58] lamb do you understand when they brought
[1:53:01] that woman in adultery had she committed
[1:53:03] adultery yeah but she came to the seven
[1:53:06] seal yeah oh don't get me started here
[1:53:09] we go again and she okay the woman is
[1:53:12] under the
[1:53:15] six come
[1:53:16] [Applause]
[1:53:19] on the seventh seal is revealed under
[1:53:23] the six seal yes the six seal is your
[1:53:27] tribulation seal for those of you that
[1:53:30] came to the altar you listen the six
[1:53:33] seal is your tribulation seal right got
[1:53:38] it the seventh seal is revealed under
[1:53:41] the six
[1:53:43] seal Christ will reveal himself in the
[1:53:48] middle of your worst days if I can say
[1:53:50] it that way amen does that make sense to
[1:53:53] you so here in the seven seal brother
[1:53:56] brandom he comes up and paragraph 261 he
[1:54:00] says I see a better stop right here cuz
[1:54:03] he's getting close to where he's going
[1:54:04] to leave ink on paper and he can't
[1:54:05] afford to do that because if he leaves
[1:54:07] ink on paper it can be perverted so
[1:54:09] paragraph 261 said brother man says I
[1:54:11] got to stop right here then he goes into
[1:54:13] Parables then he goes to paragraph 300
[1:54:16] and then he said the seven seal open in
[1:54:18] a three-fold manner One open today one

[1:56:21] seal
[1:56:25] can I show you the sick no it's too much
[1:56:29] time go ahead look at the seventh seal
[1:56:31] in Daniel chapter 2 oh

[1:56:39] with the seven
[1:56:45] seal yeah the Bible starts with the
[1:56:49] seventh seal that's right brother
[1:56:52] Genesis 1:1 oh yeah the end
[1:56:56] result Boy The Prophet's amazing e
[1:57:00] notice he

[1:57:04] there's millions of years or whatever he
[1:57:06] says there there's a there's a breach
[1:57:11] there then he
[1:57:13] says when Genesis 1:2 opens it's the
[1:57:16] result of
[1:57:17] a collapsed civilization yeah you said
[1:57:21] and it's under the six seal it has no
[1:57:23] form yeah has no void and it's all
[1:57:28] Darkness the word form and void is also
[1:57:31] has no

[1:58:07] let there be light and the light God put
[1:58:09] in you separated the light from the
[1:58:11] darkness right inside of you that is a
[1:58:14] seven seal when God moves and speaks and
[1:58:18] creates light you get the beneficiary
[1:58:21] faction of coming out of an earth
[1:58:23] without form and void and no purpose

[2:05:02] complete innocence as though you never
[2:05:05] ever did it in the first place
[2:05:12] amen Naomi let okay so now the Seven
[2:05:17] Seals opened rahab's released but since
[2:05:21] the seals open every man did what was
[2:05:23] right in his own
[2:05:25] eyes and every preacher preached the way
[2:05:28] he wanted to build any church the way
[2:05:30] they wanted to and everybody did what
[2:05:32] was right in their own eyes but there's
[2:05:33] coming a day under that there's a
[2:05:35] mystery bride
[2:05:37] coming that's why you'll find over here
[2:05:39] in the first verse under the days of the
[2:05:41] judges what was happening under the
[2:05:43] judges churches were doing whatever they
[2:05:45] wanted to do because it felt good and
[2:05:47] there were just no restrictions at all
[2:05:49] but underneath that there's a mystery
[2:05:51] bride going to take and pick her place
[2:05:54] and you'll find out that after the Book
[2:05:55] of Ruth is 1 and 2 Samuel 1 and 2 Samuel
[2:05:59] is going to be do two prophets in
[2:06:00] Revelations 11 one time so all the way
[2:06:03] back from the opening of the seals all
[2:06:05] the way to Revelations 11 right in
[2:06:07] between that there's a bride type coming
[2:06:10] for Redemption and
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:15] restoration and now turn with me to Ruth
[2:06:19] uh Esther chapter 3
[2:06:23] Naomi was ready to take all the
[2:06:27] fault if this didn't
[2:06:29] work if there was going to be anything
[2:06:32] improper in it yeah the fault would lay
[2:06:35] upon
[2:06:36] Naomi do you realized that brother
[2:06:38] brandham he
[2:06:40] recognized I the first God came the
[2:06:43] first pole was filled second pole was
[2:06:45] filled and now the angel had come in in
[2:06:48] February 28th brother Brandon knew all I
[2:06:51] I just love the way brother B says it
[2:06:53] he's in Revelations 4 and he says oh
[2:06:56] here's the book it needs to be taken and
[2:06:58] then he says oh maybe I'm just feeling
[2:07:01] this way if he doesn't come let him
[2:07:03] forever hold his peace cuz brother
[2:07:05] brandom is ready to take the fault if
[2:07:08] God doesn't come and open those seals
[2:07:11] Naomi is ready to Bear the burden
[2:07:13] because all of the church is depending
[2:07:15] on Naomi's
[2:07:17] instruction what pressure brother
[2:07:19] Brandon was under yeah
[2:07:23] cuz he was the strong Angel calling for
[2:07:25] him to
[2:07:26] come and redeem you and me
[2:07:33] amen verse chapter 2 verse 21 and Ruth
[2:07:38] the moabit said unto me also Thou shalt
[2:07:42] keep fast by my young men until they
[2:07:46] have ended all my Harvest and Naomi said
[2:07:51] unto Ruth her daughter-in-law it is good
[2:07:53] my daughter that thou go out with his
[2:07:55] maidens that they meet thee not in any
[2:07:59] other field so she kept fast by the
[2:08:03] maidens of Boaz and gleaned to the end
[2:08:07] of the barley and the wheat Harvest and
[2:08:10] dwelt with her motherinlaw watch Naomi
[2:08:14] said verse one that Naomi her
[2:08:17] motherin-law said unto her my daughter I
[2:08:22] seek rest for thee yes sir watch she'd
[2:08:28] been married
[2:08:32] before her first husband was
[2:08:35] dead and here's Naomi seeking rest for
[2:08:39] her because young people when they're
[2:08:40] not married they're Restless yeah they
[2:08:43] can't find their matate they're moving
[2:08:45] up and down they don't feel fulfilled
[2:08:47] that's not a bad thing Brothers I say
[2:08:49] that's a good thing that you're feeling
[2:08:51] rest less because the point of it is
[2:08:53] you're looking for rest and the rest
[2:08:55] you're looking for is finally when your
[2:08:57] mystery inside of you can be completed
[2:09:00] when you find your wife and you girls
[2:09:02] you're Restless until you can find your
[2:09:04] husband because there's a mystery of
[2:09:06] redemption inside of you do you know
[2:09:08] what I mean and Naomi saying listen I
[2:09:11] want to find you rest that's what Naomi
[2:09:15] saying and brother bam says I want to
[2:09:17] find you rest that's him over there
[2:09:21] because you would have not recognized
[2:09:24] Boaz if the chief Reaper hadn't
[2:09:26] appointed that out that's your husband
[2:09:28] up there what's brother Brandon doing
[2:09:30] trying to seek rest for you so you can
[2:09:34] be married to your husband
[2:09:36] Christ thank you
[2:09:44] Lord brother Ron and I know nothing
[2:09:46] about those Restless
[2:09:50] years they we're
[2:09:52] good but boy we're sure we're looking
[2:09:54] for
[2:09:57] rest and Naomi says I want to find a
[2:10:01] rest for thee that it would be well with
[2:10:05] thee
[2:10:08] amen I as a pastor I want to find rest
[2:10:11] for my
[2:10:12] church so that it'll be well with them I
[2:10:14] want to get them to their husband Christ
[2:10:17] cuz I'm their first Pastor
[2:10:20] Naomi but I'm an insecure man if I take
[2:10:24] my church and create a dependence on me
[2:10:28] because I want my church to find rest to
[2:10:30] marry Christ I don't want them to be
[2:10:32] depending on
[2:10:34] me that's
[2:10:38] right verse two and now is not boas our
[2:10:41] Kinsman whose with whose maidens thou

[2:12:10] voice of Living Waters hair white as

[2:12:15] lay down at his brass
[2:12:17] feet cuz he will tell you what is to
[2:12:20] come
[2:12:23] amen there's a Redemption mystery
[2:12:26] happening in silence behind closed
[2:12:29] doors Naomi what in the world are you
[2:12:32] doing this is
[2:12:34] ridiculous you're going to tell that
[2:12:36] woman to act like somebody that you
[2:12:40] don't want to be related to without even
[2:12:42] dating him and find out what he
[2:12:45] likes this is not about the seventh seal
[2:12:48] is not about
[2:12:49] dating the seven felds asking a question
[2:12:53] do you want to be a wife or don't
[2:12:56] you can you imagine the chance she was
[2:12:59] taking taking this girl sending him into
[2:13:03] the guy's bedroom and telling her to
[2:13:05] take the covers off and then wait there
[2:13:08] till he gives you further
[2:13:13] instructions and if it goes wrong she
[2:13:15] says take it on me I'll take the
[2:13:19] blame now Nomi looks at Ruth looks at
[2:13:22] Nomi says man this Naomi knows something
[2:13:26] I don't know this strong Angel's been
[2:13:29] connected to Boaz which I don't know
[2:13:31] nothing about all I know one thing is
[2:13:33] this
[2:13:36] obedience is better than sacrifice oh
[2:13:39] church church obedience is better than
[2:13:43] sacrifice do you know why if you have to
[2:13:45] make a sacrifice that means you're
[2:13:47] atoning for something you did wrong but
[2:13:50] if you wouldn't do nothing you don't
[2:13:51] need a
[2:13:53] sacrifice obedience hey obedience is
[2:13:58] better than sacrifice cuz if you obey
[2:14:00] there's no necessity for a
[2:14:03] sacrifice
[2:14:07] Hallelujah can you
[2:14:09] imagine the
[2:14:12] audacity and the
[2:14:14] courage of Naomi how sure she was if he
[2:14:19] don't come ah if he don't come let him
[2:14:22] forever hold his
[2:14:26] peace that strong Angel
[2:14:32] call and
[2:14:34] here Naomi don't need a
[2:14:40] sacrifice there's a whole preaching
[2:14:42] sermon in that oh yeah she
[2:14:50] obee
[2:14:56] oh it shall be when he layth down that
[2:14:59] thou shall Mark the place where he lay
[2:15:02] and thou shalt go in and uncover his
[2:15:05] feet yeah and lay down and he will tell
[2:15:10] thee what Thou shalt
[2:15:14] do when you approach Boaz you go to the
[2:15:17] Brass altar first listen to me everybody
[2:15:20] listening and you wait
[2:15:24] there you
[2:15:26] wait this is By Invitation
[2:15:33] Only John was invited to come up a
[2:15:36] little higher yes amen Elijah was
[2:15:39] invited to come in The Chariot right
[2:15:41] you're invited to come up and be his
[2:15:44] wife amen and you wait till he
[2:15:47] calls because between the feet
[2:15:52] and all the way to his side you've got
[2:15:55] to stay here and wait till he invites
[2:15:59] you to his
[2:16:05] side you know they say the way to a
[2:16:07] man's heart is through his
[2:16:09] stomach I beg to
[2:16:11] differ the way to a man's
[2:16:14] heart is exactly respect at the
[2:16:18] feet and wait till the husband takes
[2:16:20] takes and
[2:16:23] invites the point I'm making is you have
[2:16:27] to get to the Brass altar first before
[2:16:29] you invited to the altar of
[2:16:33] incense and She lays at his
[2:16:36] feet and he's
[2:16:43] startled M Caro hey God wake up get out
[2:16:47] of your
[2:16:49] sleep we need fire down here
[2:16:53] yeah and he's startled and there's a
[2:16:56] whole line of words there and she went
[2:17:00] down and on the floor and did according
[2:17:01] to when boas had eaten and was drunk and
[2:17:04] his heart was Merry and he went to lay
[2:17:06] down at the Heap of corn and she came
[2:17:08] softly and uncovered his feet and laid
[2:17:12] down and it came to pass at midnight
[2:17:15] that the man was afraid that word afraid
[2:17:17] is important and turned himself and oh
[2:17:19] that word and turn himself is
[2:17:23] important I don't have
[2:17:26] time and beheld a woman laying at his
[2:17:30] feet and he said who art thou and she
[2:17:33] said I am Ruth thine hand
[2:17:38] Maiden she already identified herself as
[2:17:42] his at the
[2:17:45] feet spread therefore thy skirt and th
[2:17:48] over thine handmaiden for thou art a
[2:17:50] near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou
[2:17:53] my daughter for thou has showed more
[2:17:55] kindness than the latter end than the
[2:17:57] beginning as much as thou has follows
[2:17:59] not young men whether poor or Rich and
[2:18:01] now my daughter fear not I will do I
[2:18:04] will tell thee what Thou shalt requirest
[2:18:07] for all the city shall know that thou
[2:18:09] art a virtuous woman your reputation has
[2:18:12] gone ahead of you amen amen
[2:18:17] amen and now it is true that I am thy
[2:18:20] near Kinsman how be it there's a Kinsman
[2:18:22] nearer than I and I don't want to get
[2:18:24] into that cuz that'll take too much time
[2:18:26] I say God bless you this
[2:18:31] [Applause]
[2:18:42] morning it's all stanner brother on
[2:18:45] going to
[2:18:47] come you
[2:18:49] know
[2:18:51] just a closing remark
[2:18:54] huh you ever wondered if the scripture
[2:18:56] was
[2:18:58] accurate and if the scripture could show
[2:19:00] you things to
[2:19:04] come it's amazing what's in the Bible
[2:19:07] and how it's
[2:19:08] written do you remember there's a girl I
[2:19:11] feel sorry for in the Bible actually I
[2:19:13] feel sorry for her her name was
[2:19:17] Jezebel can you imagine a girl that's a
[2:19:20] daughter of a PR least than a
[2:19:22] king now that girl dad had no time for
[2:19:25] her at
[2:19:27] all and that girl got shoved to the side
[2:19:30] because he had meetings to go to too
[2:19:32] often and then his dad was a priest and
[2:19:35] then surrounded her with a bunch of
[2:19:36] religion and that girl just got harder
[2:19:39] and harder and harder and
[2:19:41] harder and I feel sorry for Jezebel
[2:19:45] because you can't imagine that that girl
[2:19:48] got hurt so many times that she said I'm
[2:19:51] never going to trust the man again
[2:19:52] they'll make promises and then they
[2:19:54] break him they make promises then they
[2:19:55] break him and finally the insecurity in
[2:19:57] her would only find a man she could
[2:20:01] control because she was
[2:20:08] hurt you know the story you get Jezebel
[2:20:11] married Ahab the reason Jezebel married
[2:20:13] Ahab because he was a dishrag and she
[2:20:16] needed a dishrag to stay safe she
[2:20:18] couldn't handle a man stronger than
[2:20:23] but what I find interesting in these
[2:20:25] stories is that in the end you'll find
[2:20:29] Ahab brother Brandon does some amazing
[2:20:32] things he takes Ahab and types Ahab to
[2:20:37] JFK and and and when brother Brandon
[2:20:39] came to open the church ages it was 1960
[2:20:43] he knew those Church ages had to open
[2:20:45] because Ahab was on the throne JFK was
[2:20:47] on the
[2:20:48] throne all right I I want you to
[2:20:51] I'm saying this as icing this is the
[2:20:53] cherry on the icing
[2:20:54] okay do you know it is so interesting to
[2:20:58] this day they still don't know who
[2:21:01] killed
[2:21:02] JFK right you can go anywhere you want
[2:21:04] it's still a big argument and a mystery
[2:21:06] and all this kind of
[2:21:07] stuff you know what's interesting here's
[2:21:10] what's interesting
[2:21:13] JFK right if you find out Ahab Ahab died
[2:21:18] in First Kings First Kings
[2:21:21] uh the 22nd chapter the 35th
[2:21:25] verse First Kings 22 verse
[2:21:30] 35 that's the verse where Ahab
[2:21:34] dies JFK was killed in the 11th month on
[2:21:39] the 22nd day and he was the 35th
[2:21:42] President of the United
[2:21:45] States it's so amazing to me that first
[2:21:48] Kings is the 11th book in the Bible
[2:21:53] do you know that he was killed on the
[2:21:55] 22nd of November the 11th
[2:21:59] months and
[2:22:01] Ahab Ahab dies in the 22nd
[2:22:06] chapter you know what gets really more
[2:22:08] weird he was the 25th president of the
[2:22:12] United
[2:22:13] States of 35th
[2:22:15] sorry now go to verse 35 in your
[2:22:19] Bible and it's amazing how that Bible
[2:22:22] types it out exactly for all the
[2:22:24] unbelievers if they don't believe
[2:22:25] brother Brandon was true because the
[2:22:28] Bible says in a certain man no name
[2:22:30] certain
[2:22:32] man right who was he don't know what is
[2:22:37] his name don't know what is he trying to
[2:22:39] do don't know a certain man pulled up a
[2:22:42] bow and arrow and said I'll take a
[2:22:44] chance a predestinated arrow correct
[2:22:48] from a man unidentified
[2:22:52] wow I say our God is great yeah that's
[2:22:56] the Bible God bless you brother on come

[2:27:48] we thank you for Jesus being the center
[2:27:50] of Our Lives we thank you for the
[2:27:51] Nuggets that we have heard the
[2:27:53] scriptural examples that we can live by
[2:27:56] daily and apply to our PR our life and
[2:27:58] the principles of our life we thank you
[2:28:00] for what we've heard in these four
[2:28:02] Services Lord may we take the things
[2:28:04] that we've heard in these four services
[2:28:06] and and apply them and may we put them

[2:28:30] being the guest of honor Lord to come by
[2:28:33] and just minister to us in a
[2:28:34] supernatural way as you take a minister
[2:28:37] off of his thought and have him deal
[2:28:39] with something that an individual will
[2:28:41] be going through here to be able to let
[2:28:43] know that Christ is on the scene to
[2:28:45] touch that individual's need and we say
[2:28:47] thank you Lord for that Lord some people
[2:28:49] might say it's a diversion but no it's
[2:28:51] God using a minister an angel in the
[2:28:53] pull pit to minister to a heart and we
[2:28:56] say thank you for that Lord today we
