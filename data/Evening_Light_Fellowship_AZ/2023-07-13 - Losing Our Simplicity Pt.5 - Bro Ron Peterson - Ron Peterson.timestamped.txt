[13:25] to a building this nice with the air
[13:27] conditioned
[13:28] it's plenty hot outside so we're not
[13:31] Outdoors under a tin roof and uh just it
[13:36] may be a little different but I believe
[13:37] if you'll just put your knee before the
[13:40] Lord that he'll meet it by the
[13:42] ministering of the word amen do you
[13:44] believe that

[14:26] live he just wants God's will for his
[14:28] life
[14:29] please pray for his family during this
[14:31] difficult time
[14:32] and man that's a
[14:34] pretty serious need but you know I know
[14:36] God is mindful
[14:37] we have a special unspoken request here
[14:40] for Brother Joseph Sanders it's the son
[14:44] of Clinton Robbie Lynn Sanders from
[14:46] Texas who are most likely streaming so
[14:49] say God bless you knowing the Lord will
[14:51] meet the need

[15:04] him for him in Jefferson he had just
[15:07] turned 80. he's diagnosed with stage
[15:09] four cancer in four or five places and
[15:12] God lifted him up he's he's a man of
[15:14] Faith he's a devout Nazarene he believes
[15:17] in healing just a real godly man he's
[15:20] been a real mentor to me
[15:22] my whole life just steady a steady man
[15:24] and uh
[15:26] the doctors have pronounced terminal
[15:30] prognosis over him and he is very weak
[15:33] as his cancer is back out of remission
[15:36] he was less than a year away from being
[15:38] cancer free it's five years so just weak
[15:42] it's hard for him to take even the
[15:44] projected treatments his calcium gets
[15:47] way off and I try to call and talk to
[15:48] him and just his speech is very slurred
[15:51] it's hard to communicate and so just

[15:59] man just a God's will be done
[16:01] and he's at peace you know just

[16:14] afraid of death

[37:06] uh brother on um Ethan Strayer are we
[37:10] live streaming
[37:12] we are okay praise the Lord okay because
[37:15] I didn't know I told him I said look if
[37:17] it's too much if it's too hard too
[37:19] technical then we won't live stream and
[37:23] uh so uh but we are so praise the lord
[37:25] we will have these Services archived
[37:28] now
[37:29] um uh tonight is going to be a little
[37:32] bit different we had
[37:35] the Brethren had asked me brother Ron
[37:37] how do you want to set it up do you want
[37:39] the pulpit over there do you want the
[37:40] people wide and I said well remember the
[37:43] gospel goes from east to west is that
[37:47] right we know that it travels from uh
[37:49] does anybody know which way is east
[37:53] Amos stand up and point
[37:56] it's that way so the gospel is traveling
[38:00] tonight from east to west
[38:02] praise the Lord Brother Branham had
[38:03] always said if I had a church and I
[38:06] wanted it exactly the way I would have
[38:08] the pulpit in the East the word going to
[38:11] the West
[38:12] praise the Lord so you are fulfilling
[38:15] prophecy tonight
[38:16] God bless you um
[38:19] ah
[38:21] now it is my desire for this Sunday and
[38:24] for the next Wednesday the Lord willing
[38:27] that we just don't scatter all over but
[38:29] what I do is bring everybody a little
[38:31] bit more forward come up here and and
[38:33] we're not going to do it tonight but
[38:35] Sunday will probably be needing to fill
[38:37] all these chairs so I don't want
[38:39] everybody as far back as uh where uh
[38:43] brother Mario is at and those are the
[38:45] different ones back there Marlon I
[38:47] should say Marlin and Allison uh can you

[39:09] gonna really bring him and pack them in
[39:12] here a little bit closer yes we will use
[39:14] those back there but I think brother
[39:16] Michael has said to reserve those for
[39:19] the families the little ones so that
[39:20] they get up and and if they have to get
[39:23] up and go use a nursery or something now
[39:26] for tonight for tonight only you if you
[39:30] want to you can go into Fourier here or
[39:32] go out the doors of the Fourier and into
[39:35] the kitchen door and this room right
[39:37] here is made like for nursing mothers
[39:39] privately okay
[39:41] and if others wanted to sit out there
[39:43] with their children or whatever that'll
[39:47] be fine on Sunday morning I'm going to

[39:55] we're going to open that up we'll have a
[39:57] room or two
[39:59] um set up there for the nursing mothers

[44:19] second Corinthians 11 verses
[44:22] one through four
[44:31] would to God you could bear with me a
[44:33] little in my Folly and indeed
[44:36] bear with me
[44:38] for I am jealous over you with a Godly
[44:40] jealousy
[44:42] for I've espoused you to one husband
[44:46] then I may present you as a chaste
[44:49] virgin to Christ
[44:52] but I fear
[44:55] lest by any means as the serpent
[44:57] beguiled Eve through his subtlety
[45:01] so your mind should be corrupted from
[45:03] the simplicity
[45:05] that is in Christ
[45:07] for he that cometh preacheth another
[45:09] Jesus
[45:12] whom you have not preached we have not
[45:15] preached or if you receive another
[45:17] Spirit which you have not received or
[45:21] another gospel
[45:23] which you have not accepted you might
[45:26] well bear with him
[45:30] father God in the name of Jesus I ask
[45:32] that you would
[45:34] speak to our hearts take this text
[45:36] father as we have waited and labored
[45:40] in meditation
[45:42] I pray that father you will take those
[45:45] things that you have revealed to me and
[45:47] spoken to me and caused me to study over
[45:50] these things
[45:52] that the word of God would be rightly
[45:55] divided
[45:57] the a Workman that would need not to be
[46:01] ashamed rightly dividing Thy word so
[46:04] father we need the Holy Spirit to come
[46:06] and Quicken our minds our thoughts
[46:08] I pray not only quickened my mind but
[46:10] Quicken the minds of the hearer
[46:13] because we know the holy spirit is the
[46:15] Divine revealer of the word come now
[46:17] Open the Eyes of our heart we pray in
[46:20] Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be
[46:23] seated
[46:25] turn with me if you would I'd like two
[46:27] more scriptures
[46:28] turn with me to the book of Titus
[46:31] Titus Chapter 1.
[46:36] right after a second Timothy is Titus
[46:39] Titus 1 7 through 14.
[46:46] for a bishop must be blameless as a
[46:50] steward of God
[46:52] not self-willed
[46:54] not soon angry
[46:57] not given to Wine no Striker not given
[47:00] to filthy lucra
[47:03] but her lover of hospitality
[47:06] a lover of Good Men
[47:09] sober just totally temperate
[47:12] holding fast the faithful word as he has
[47:15] been taught
[47:16] that he may be able to
[47:18] by sound Doctrine both to exhort and to
[47:22] convince the gainsayers
[47:26] for there are many unruly and vain
[47:28] talkers and deceivers
[47:31] especially they of the circumcision
[47:36] whose mouths must be stopped
[47:39] who subvert whole houses
[47:42] teaching things which they ought not for
[47:45] filthy Luther's sake
[47:50] of themselves even a prophet of their
[47:52] own said the Christians are always Liars
[47:55] evil beasts slowbillies
[47:58] this witness is true wherefore rebuke
[48:01] them sharply
[48:04] that may be
[48:06] sound in the faith
[48:09] not giving heed to Jewish Fables
[48:12] and Commandments of men in turn
[48:15] from the truth
[48:17] turn with me if you would to the gospel
[48:21] of Saint Mark
[48:23] Saint Mark chapter 7.
[48:25] verses 6 through 9.
[48:35] and he answered and said to them well
[48:37] hath Isaiah's prophesied
[48:40] of you Hypocrites as it is written this
[48:43] people
[48:44] honoreth me with their lips but their
[48:47] heart is far from me
[48:49] I'll be in vain they do worship the
[48:51] worship me teaching for Doctrine the
[48:55] Commandments of men
[48:58] for laying aside the Commandment of God
[49:02] you hold the tradition of men
[49:05] as the washing it gives examples here
[49:09] as washing of pots and of Cups and many
[49:12] other such things ye do
[49:16] and he said unto them full will he
[49:20] reject the Commandment of God
[49:22] that you may keep your own tradition
[49:26] God bless the reading of your word this
[49:29] evening
[49:31] and I am titling this
[49:34] losing our Simplicity this is part five
[49:39] I don't know that I'll have a another
[49:41] part to this but if I do it'll only be a
[49:44] tangent off of this actually the word of
[49:46] God is a never-ending story
[49:50] all we do is
[49:51] we let you go home go to work go to bed
[49:54] eat sleep and then come back and we
[49:56] continue the story
[49:58] because it never ends in fact I'm going
[50:00] to tell you a secret that brother
[50:02] Branham said the unfolding of the Gospel
[50:04] will continue throughout the eternities
[50:08] he is so great and he is so mighty
[50:11] and his power is so great
[50:14] and his wisdom beyond the fathom of man
[50:17] and of carnal mind that it will take an
[50:21] eternity for God to reveal himself
[50:23] wow I don't know about you but my little
[50:26] finite brain all of a sudden
[50:29] my hard drive is overloaded I can't
[50:31] comprehend that but I do know this that
[50:35] when he
[50:36] comes and our bodies are changed in
[50:40] light to his body we shall know him even
[50:44] as he is known
[50:46] there will be no more carnality thinking
[50:49] there'll be no this but we will have the
[50:51] very mind of Christ
[50:53] and we will be like him even as he is
[50:58] hallelujah what a day that will be and I
[51:01] believe it's going to be soon
[51:03] I believe the days of the Gentiles is
[51:05] just about over I believe that time for
[51:08] the Gentile door of its being open is
[51:11] soon to be completely shut and when God
[51:14] does
[51:15] there'll be not another Gentile saved
[51:19] no because the Salvation will be over
[51:21] blood leaves The Mercy Seat God requires
[51:25] blood if there's no more blood than the
[51:27] foolish virgin give
[51:29] their blood
[51:31] so I would rather right now today take
[51:34] the Judgment of God to myself because
[51:37] judgment begins at the house of God
[51:40] we are here to now see where we fall
[51:43] short and God help us and enline our
[51:45] lives up that our lives will be worthy
[51:47] of the Gospel
[51:48] foolish virgin
[51:50] doesn't do it
[51:52] no oil
[51:54] no full revelation of the word of God
[51:56] therefore there's no desire really to
[51:59] get their life straightened up
[52:02] oh God help us to be all elect bright
[52:05] that elect lady that says oh God help me
[52:07] speak to me
[52:09] let me be found worthy of thy coming
[52:12] so tonight losing our Simplicity part
[52:15] five
[52:16] I want to speak on unruly
[52:19] and vain talkers
[52:22] deceivers
[52:25] now we know that just as the early
[52:27] church
[52:29] had false prophets and false teachers
[52:31] come
[52:33] and as the Holy Ghost filled Church
[52:35] within just a few decades
[52:39] this well wasn't hundreds and hundreds
[52:41] of years this is 20 and 30 years already
[52:46] they're losing their love for God they
[52:48] have lost
[52:49] their first love
[52:51] they've already got ones coming in
[52:54] that's separating the Sheep the false
[52:56] prophets false teachers he didn't mean
[52:59] this he didn't mean that hymenius and
[53:01] philitus have already come shook the
[53:03] church resurrection's already over and
[53:06] overthrown the faith of some that's the
[53:08] early church that's a holy ghost-filled
[53:11] ones
[53:12] that most of them saw a Pentecost of
[53:16] Acts chapter 2.
[53:18] so regardless of having the holy spirit
[53:21] in your life regardless of having a holy
[53:24] spirit Ministry regardless of of the
[53:28] workings of God and signs and wonders
[53:30] Among Us the devil does not sleep and he
[53:34] is constantly bombarding the Church of
[53:37] the Living God
[53:38] and you are his Target
[53:41] and the greatest battle ever fought is
[53:43] in your mind
[53:45] therefore let us take every thought
[53:47] bring its subject and captive to the
[53:50] mind of Christ can you say Amen to that
[53:52] now I ask you this question how can this
[53:57] happen so quickly to the Church of the
[53:59] Living God
[54:00] because we know the devil will do
[54:02] everything that he can he goeth about as
[54:04] a roaring lion seeking whom he may
[54:07] devour he told Peter Peter I know the
[54:10] devil is trying to sift you like wheat
[54:12] but I've prayed for you
[54:14] oh my my brother my sister that you are
[54:17] no match for the devil brother Branham
[54:20] said you must stay behind the protection
[54:22] of the word lest the enemy come in
[54:24] hybridize
[54:26] the word of God and you become
[54:28] hybridized yourself lukewarm formal
[54:31] powerless religious
[54:34] from such the Bible says turn away
[54:39] it's amazing how quickly a Revival dies
[54:43] Moses was only gone for 40 days and he
[54:46] built a golden calf
[54:51] whenever the angel messenger goes off
[54:53] the scene I'm going to I'm going to
[54:56] speak to you in the natural sense to
[55:00] just appeal to your understanding
[55:04] that there is after the messenger goes
[55:06] off the scene there's a bunch of leaders
[55:09] vying to take the position of the
[55:12] leadership of the church
[55:14] they want to fill the vacuum
[55:16] they want to be the next Joshua they
[55:20] want to be the Timothy they want to be
[55:23] somebody and we have even in this age
[55:25] and many of them who feel they are the
[55:28] prophet after the prophet
[55:30] The Eighth Day messenger or however way
[55:33] you want to look at it they all use the
[55:36] message as a platform for the
[55:39] springboard of their own Ministry
[55:41] brother Branham said there'll not be two
[55:43] of us here at the same time
[55:45] he said well when one goes off the scene
[55:47] the other one will come on and they use
[55:49] those quotes where you know uh I'm lit
[55:52] if I have not done the work
[55:55] that God has told me to do if I'm not
[55:57] really the last one I'm laying a
[55:59] platform for another man to come
[56:02] now that is true my brother and sister
[56:04] but it's not a natural man
[56:06] I want to say to you that have a
[56:09] revelation in your heart it is a
[56:11] revealing of the son of man
[56:13] so the platform he is laying is not
[56:15] Behold a man he's be saying behold the
[56:18] son of man I'm showing you the revealing
[56:22] of the mystery of God as he is revealed
[56:25] to his servants the prophets amen
[56:30] all of them using the prophet's message
[56:32] as a platform to vindicate their own
[56:34] Ministry
[56:36] this happened in the Church of galatia
[56:38] Paul had to to warn them in Galatians 1
[56:42] 6-12 if you'd like to write that down or
[56:45] follow along in your Bible
[56:47] Galatians 1 6 through 12. I Marvel
[56:51] that you are so soon removed from him
[56:55] that called you into the grace of Christ
[56:57] unto another gospel
[56:59] how has this happened
[57:02] so easily removed
[57:05] you that know better
[57:08] which is not another but there's some
[57:10] that trouble you
[57:12] and would pervert the gospel of Christ
[57:16] but though we are an angel from heaven
[57:18] now he gets very personal
[57:20] preach any other gospel unto you that
[57:22] which we have preached unto you let him
[57:24] be accursed
[57:26] and he says it again
[57:28] as we said before and so I say now again
[57:30] if any man preach any other gospel
[57:33] unto you then that you have received let
[57:37] him be accursed
[57:40] for do I now persuade men
[57:43] or God or do I seek to please men
[57:47] for if I yet please men I should not be
[57:50] the servant of Christ
[57:52] but I certify you Brethren that the
[57:56] gospel which was preached of me is not
[57:58] after man
[57:59] I neither received it of man neither was
[58:03] I taught it
[58:04] but by the revelation of Jesus Christ
[58:09] oh God we know that you're going to
[58:11] build your church upon the solid rock of
[58:14] the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not
[58:16] upon what you have learned by man it
[58:20] isn't given to you by man you uh he you
[58:23] are not educated into it
[58:26] you can't be taught it by men it's got
[58:28] to be the Revelation though the ministry
[58:31] have a holy ghost Ministry it must be a
[58:34] holy ghost Ministry in those that sit on
[58:38] the chair
[58:40] that they hear what the spirit is saying
[58:42] unto the church somebody say Amen
[58:45] it's true
[58:48] in Galatians chapter 3 verse 1 Paul
[58:52] again says o foolish Galatians
[58:56] who hath Bewitched you
[58:59] we're only talking 60 years since the
[59:01] time of calvary
[59:05] come on
[59:08] that you should not obey the truth
[59:10] just imagine that just a few years only
[59:14] a few decades
[59:16] many of the
[59:18] Apostles and early disciples were still
[59:21] alive
[59:23] who Bewitched you
[59:27] Galatians 5.
[59:29] verses seven through nine you did run
[59:31] well
[59:34] who did hinder you
[59:36] that you should not obey the truth
[59:39] oh don't Glory over the fact oh my I
[59:42] remember in the early days and we ran we
[59:44] did this we did that yeah you ran well
[59:47] but this ain't no friend
[59:49] this is a marathon
[59:51] this persuasion cometh not of him that
[59:54] calleth you a little leaven beloveds the
[59:57] whole lump
[1:00:00] just a few short years already the early
[1:00:03] church
[1:00:04] begin to be attacked by false brethren
[1:00:07] false prophets false teachers seducing
[1:00:11] clear clergy Spirit brother Brown said
[1:00:13] you know what a seducing spirit is in
[1:00:15] the church
[1:00:17] he said how
[1:00:18] how does a seducing Spirit come in he
[1:00:21] said it's a seducing clergy spirit
[1:00:25] yeah
[1:00:26] in the sermon lamb and the dove I'm
[1:00:28] giving you these quotes you can go onto
[1:00:31] our website
[1:00:32] you can read them in their entirety
[1:00:35] but better yet go listen to the tape
[1:00:38] the lamb in the Dove 1956 Los Angeles
[1:00:42] at last steaming I kind of butchered it
[1:00:44] kind of hard he means I really I really
[1:00:47] preached the gospel pretty
[1:00:49] Blood and Guts everywhere
[1:00:52] he butchered it pretty hard
[1:00:56] I didn't mean to do that in that way to
[1:00:58] hurt you
[1:01:00] this is the night before
[1:01:04] excuse me
[1:01:05] this is the night after
[1:01:08] the service that he preaches and I
[1:01:10] listened to it last night
[1:01:13] you want to talk about a guy that really
[1:01:15] gets hard on Pentecost
[1:01:17] and you've left your first love he is
[1:01:19] there 50 years after
[1:01:21] 1906 it is 1956 it is in Angela's Temple
[1:01:26] it is among those who many of them were
[1:01:29] a part of that Revival
[1:01:31] this is the night after he preaches
[1:01:34] Azusa Jubilee
[1:01:37] listen to this
[1:01:40] but since you have included me in your
[1:01:42] rank
[1:01:44] I'm trying my best to stand mutually
[1:01:46] between the different denominations
[1:01:48] because they've already denominated
[1:01:51] we are a Brethren I love all the
[1:01:53] denominations I'm trying to stand in the
[1:01:56] Gap and say we are Brethren together
[1:02:00] and I believe if God will let me have
[1:02:03] something to do in uniting the body of
[1:02:06] Christ
[1:02:08] I think that's the sickest body that I
[1:02:10] know of but the greatest Divine Healing
[1:02:13] that needs to be done tonight is the
[1:02:15] body of Christ to be healed in one
[1:02:18] person and what a marvelous time to do
[1:02:21] it right now at Azusa Street rally where
[1:02:24] we can all become one again
[1:02:27] it seemed to be in my own church
[1:02:30] brother Brown's talking about his own
[1:02:32] church
[1:02:37] I kind of would say I'm the black sheep
[1:02:42] I believed in a real holy
[1:02:46] and filled life
[1:02:48] and then when I found that there was
[1:02:50] people who stood for that it just fit
[1:02:52] like glove on a hand and then when I
[1:02:55] come into the rank here be looked down
[1:02:57] and see that it's slipping away
[1:03:01] that kind of stirs me up it's not
[1:03:03] because I need to do not like you I say
[1:03:06] those
[1:03:07] cutting things it's because I do love
[1:03:09] you
[1:03:11] when I see the enemy leaping in back
[1:03:15] here and the worldlyism creeping into
[1:03:17] the church I just can't hold my peace
[1:03:22] in the sermon here ye him
[1:03:25] I want to say this before I start
[1:03:26] preaching
[1:03:28] the greatest need of healing tonight and
[1:03:30] the sickest body that I know of in all
[1:03:32] the world
[1:03:33] is the body of the Lord Jesus the church
[1:03:38] oh it's horribly sick it's broke up it's
[1:03:43] scattered
[1:03:44] it needs a healing may God send the holy
[1:03:48] spirit in such a power till the whole
[1:03:51] body of Christ will be brought together
[1:03:54] bound with love and unity
[1:04:00] we would see Jesus just a few months
[1:04:03] later I believe that there
[1:04:05] is the need of healing tonight more than
[1:04:07] physical healing
[1:04:09] he trying to wean them away
[1:04:13] from the physical healing he said if you
[1:04:15] got healed this week you might die of
[1:04:16] another sickness next
[1:04:21] I want to ask you which is greater
[1:04:22] physical healing or spiritual healing
[1:04:26] physical eyesight
[1:04:28] or spiritual eyesight
[1:04:31] we we have tended to get off of looking
[1:04:36] at what is greater Jesus said
[1:04:40] Philip to
[1:04:43] he says to Philip behold in Israel whom
[1:04:45] there is an old guile
[1:04:47] oh
[1:04:48] Rabbi rabbi
[1:04:50] he says because I told you behold an
[1:04:53] Israelite I discerned your heart
[1:04:56] greater than these
[1:04:59] you'll see angels Angels ascending
[1:05:01] against
[1:05:03] greater things I want to make all of you
[1:05:06] aware that there is a greater healing
[1:05:09] Than Physical yet we believe in physical
[1:05:11] healing but God the sickest body there
[1:05:14] is because your Prophet said it
[1:05:17] is the body of Christ why they fail to
[1:05:19] discern the Lord's body
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:25] Ephesians 4 verse 11 and 15. he gave
[1:05:29] some Apostles somebody say some
[1:05:33] some Prophets
[1:05:35] some evangelist
[1:05:37] some pastors and teachers
[1:05:40] for the perfecting of the saints that
[1:05:42] means the maturing
[1:05:46] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:05:49] edifying of the body of Christ
[1:05:51] till we all come into the unity of the
[1:05:54] faith
[1:05:55] and in the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:05:57] unto a perfect man under the measure the
[1:06:01] stature the fullness of Christ
[1:06:04] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:06:07] tossed to and fro carried about with
[1:06:09] every wind of Doctrine
[1:06:11] by the slight of men in cunning
[1:06:13] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:06:15] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[1:06:19] May grow up into all him into him in all
[1:06:23] things which is the head even Christ
[1:06:26] till we come to the unity of the faith
[1:06:28] how can we have Unity of faith when sir
[1:06:31] we're so broken up by interpretation and
[1:06:34] opinion and isms within the message
[1:06:37] there's only one way to be able to have
[1:06:39] the unity of the Revelation and that is
[1:06:41] to have the unity of the Faith by say
[1:06:45] what he said
[1:06:46] leave it alone
[1:06:54] don't change it just leave it alone
[1:06:57] you don't need your opinion
[1:07:00] don't need your interpretation God is
[1:07:03] his own interpreter
[1:07:06] the bride will be United with the word
[1:07:10] and will be one with the word why
[1:07:13] because she is word born
[1:07:16] it's a word birth
[1:07:19] blind Bartimaeus
[1:07:21] 1950 Sand 57
[1:07:25] the prophet says next week the Lord
[1:07:28] willing I want to preach on a greater
[1:07:29] healing
[1:07:32] a healing in a higher standard
[1:07:37] that's the healing of the body
[1:07:39] of the Lord Jesus is broken
[1:07:42] body
[1:07:44] isn't that interesting
[1:07:46] I want to talk about a greater healing
[1:07:53] brother Brown said the pattern is the
[1:07:55] same in every age has been
[1:07:58] from Ephesus all the way to laudiusia
[1:08:02] I don't want to Major on a minor
[1:08:06] brother Brahm said evidence of the
[1:08:07] Resurrection 1958 Jeffersonville
[1:08:11] but today you can preach repentance and
[1:08:13] Hell Fire in Brimstone and people will
[1:08:16] laugh at it
[1:08:17] what's the matter
[1:08:19] our hearts are cold we're indifferent we
[1:08:22] got too much we need less of the world
[1:08:24] and more of God our hearts are too cold
[1:08:28] we've become interested in some emotion
[1:08:31] we become interested interested if we
[1:08:34] can dance if we can shout I believe in
[1:08:36] that
[1:08:37] if we can speak in tongues I believe in
[1:08:39] it
[1:08:40] I believe in every bit of it but if we
[1:08:43] have that and don't have that agonizing
[1:08:45] weeping broke up Spirit a broken and
[1:08:49] contrite spirit I will not refuse
[1:08:52] you know one thing that really blows my
[1:08:54] mind where is humility among the
[1:08:57] ministry and the message
[1:09:02] find me a humble preacher
[1:09:06] instead we have arrogant leaders
[1:09:09] getting up there they become The
[1:09:11] Untouchables
[1:09:14] God give us humility
[1:09:16] let me tell you my brother my sister I
[1:09:19] am nothing
[1:09:23] without him I can do nothing
[1:09:27] amen but with him
[1:09:29] I can do all things
[1:09:31] through Christ it strengthens me
[1:09:36] I'm tired of the politicking
[1:09:39] the arrogance and the the proud Spirits
[1:09:42] pride comes before a fall
[1:09:47] the ministry is no longer the Servants
[1:09:49] of the people but the people are the
[1:09:50] servants to the ministry
[1:09:53] what a shame
[1:09:56] Jesus said if you want to be great
[1:09:59] learn to be the servant of all
[1:10:02] he said which is greater
[1:10:04] he said you're sitting in a chair and
[1:10:06] you're being served
[1:10:07] he said is not he that is being served
[1:10:10] greater than the one that's serving
[1:10:12] because you're sitting down
[1:10:15] in French Oba
[1:10:18] or in German huh German yeah Oba
[1:10:21] come here Peter
[1:10:27] so what you're doing you're asking God
[1:10:28] God here I am
[1:10:30] I've been I've been through hell this
[1:10:32] week
[1:10:34] I've been through troubles I I need a
[1:10:36] word tonight I need you to tank me off
[1:10:38] tonight I need to top off I've been
[1:10:40] running on fumes why the devil's been
[1:10:43] chasing me I've been having problems
[1:10:46] that's good for you
[1:10:49] Billy Paul when he said daddy daddy pray
[1:10:51] for me pray for you for what well the
[1:10:54] devil's after me and I'm so nervous I
[1:10:55] just I just don't know what to do he
[1:10:58] said that's good for you Billy
[1:11:01] he said it shows me one thing he hasn't
[1:11:04] got you
[1:11:05] your trials and temptations you're going
[1:11:08] to go through it yes you're not a bunch
[1:11:11] of baby hot house plants
[1:11:13] no you don't be put into a tunnel after
[1:11:16] you've been born again and nothing of
[1:11:17] the world bothers you and you walk
[1:11:19] around in the euphoric state of Nirvana
[1:11:21] it's okay
[1:11:23] love love love
[1:11:26] that's nonsense man the moment you get
[1:11:29] converted the moment you get born again
[1:11:31] you got a bullseye in your target a
[1:11:33] Target on your back and the devil's
[1:11:35] doing everything he can
[1:11:38] to try to dissuade you bombard your mind
[1:11:40] it's using media he's using television
[1:11:43] radio uh uh movies he's using every
[1:11:46] billboard everything around you
[1:11:49] why this is Satan's Eden but here in the
[1:11:52] midst of Satan's Eden Hallelujah God has
[1:11:55] got a bride who is being kept by the
[1:11:58] spirit of God and it no matter how dark
[1:12:00] it doesn't matter how bad it gets he's
[1:12:03] going to have a bride without spot or
[1:12:06] wrinkle
[1:12:07] glory to God
[1:12:10] and let me tell you let me pop your
[1:12:11] bubble and eat because of you
[1:12:14] it's because of the seed that God put
[1:12:16] into you and God watches over his seed
[1:12:20] he said I made a promise to your father
[1:12:22] Abraham that I will watch over the seed
[1:12:25] and to the seed seed even to as many
[1:12:31] as the Lord Our God shall call that
[1:12:33] includes Us in ladies
[1:12:35] aesthetically includes us here in July
[1:12:38] of 2023 in the midst of a dark and dying
[1:12:42] and a lgbq lyc and everything else
[1:12:48] such a bombardment of the minds
[1:13:01] he says
[1:13:03] we become interested in some emotion
[1:13:08] but if we have that and don't have that
[1:13:10] agonizing weeping and broken spirit
[1:13:16] brother Branham also give you another
[1:13:18] quote right here off the top of my head
[1:13:20] brother Abraham said
[1:13:21] he gives the Holy Ghost to those who who
[1:13:24] sigh and cry for the Abomination I'm not
[1:13:27] talking about out there
[1:13:30] because
[1:13:32] he's their father and their Works he
[1:13:35] will do
[1:13:37] but he Sighs and cries the Abominations
[1:13:41] that come right on into the church and
[1:13:44] Brethren and sister let me tell you
[1:13:46] tonight the devil's doing everything he
[1:13:48] can to invade
[1:13:50] the Bride of Jesus Christ and to cause
[1:13:53] her to become powerless weak formal
[1:13:56] religious
[1:13:58] um
[1:14:00] God can never use it these things are
[1:14:02] good but we got to have the other way to
[1:14:05] go with it we've left off the main thing
[1:14:08] and gone for a secondary
[1:14:11] you can never major on a minor
[1:14:15] how about those
[1:14:16] that go to sighing and crying
[1:14:19] are you one of them
[1:14:22] amen the gift is wonderful hear his
[1:14:24] works it's fair
[1:14:26] Lord help me
[1:14:29] I've been eating The Grapes of Canaan
[1:14:32] and I'm so excited I'm slobbering
[1:14:36] let me slow down help me to articulate
[1:14:39] my words
[1:14:41] because except the trumpet gives a
[1:14:43] certain sound you won't know what to do
[1:14:47] works is Faith expressed
[1:14:52] 19 and 65.
[1:14:55] the gift is wonderful but you can't use
[1:14:57] your Eternal destination on gifts
[1:15:01] you gotta major on a minor
[1:15:05] and a gift is a minor
[1:15:07] and Satan can impersonate any gift of
[1:15:11] that God has got
[1:15:13] he can make something just look exactly
[1:15:16] like it see therefore we got to watch
[1:15:19] sometimes I express about Shelton I've
[1:15:22] seen demons shout see
[1:15:25] speak in tongues I've seen demons speak
[1:15:27] in tongues sure he impersonates it it's
[1:15:30] a it isn't a genuine but it impersonates
[1:15:34] it see makes it look like it's real
[1:15:37] and people sometimes we don't know the
[1:15:39] difference declare this to be real when
[1:15:42] it isn't real
[1:15:45] same thing they do with Divine Healing
[1:15:48] they think well it's a Hocus Pocus or
[1:15:52] something like that it isn't it's a
[1:15:54] genuine unadulterated faith in God
[1:15:57] on what he said to be the truth and that
[1:16:00] anchors
[1:16:01] when it anchors and there's nothing in a
[1:16:04] movie it's going to stay there
[1:16:07] Psalms 107 verse 20. he sent his word
[1:16:11] and it healed them and delivered them
[1:16:13] from their destruction
[1:16:17] brother Branham said in Jehovah Jireh
[1:16:20] 1961.
[1:16:21] now if you do not believe remember don't
[1:16:24] come in the prayer line
[1:16:28] then he says I wanted for some of the
[1:16:30] Brethren on this side and some on that
[1:16:32] side
[1:16:32] ministers to form a prayer line but
[1:16:35] before I start the prayer line listen
[1:16:37] friends I want to ask you brethren
[1:16:41] I got perfect confidence in you as my
[1:16:43] brethren
[1:16:45] I know your men of God called of God I'm
[1:16:47] trying to let this audience know
[1:16:50] that they don't have to wait for
[1:16:52] somebody to come by or with a special
[1:16:55] gift
[1:16:56] gifts don't heal
[1:16:59] gifts only declare God
[1:17:03] so your gift is to do that that the
[1:17:05] original way
[1:17:07] is to believe the word
[1:17:12] he sent his word
[1:17:14] to heal them
[1:17:16] that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:17:18] but then God's so good and he makes such
[1:17:21] promises
[1:17:23] if you can't believe the word
[1:17:26] then he shows them a sign
[1:17:28] that it's him there
[1:17:31] a prophet is a sign
[1:17:34] now do you believe me to be God's
[1:17:36] prophet
[1:17:37] I don't say that of my own
[1:17:40] do you believe me
[1:17:42] you do
[1:17:45] you see now all of a sudden he goes into
[1:17:47] that prophetic gift
[1:17:49] and what God is doing
[1:17:52] is
[1:17:54] he is uplifting their faith
[1:17:56] because they didn't have enough faith in
[1:17:59] the word alone that he gives them a sign
[1:18:01] and a prophet is a sign
[1:18:04] so the prophet who has the word
[1:18:07] he takes the people
[1:18:09] and as Austin Johnson took me and lifted
[1:18:12] me up you couldn't keep me that way the
[1:18:15] whole service
[1:18:17] Maybe
[1:18:20] but
[1:18:21] brother Ram said here I am using a gift
[1:18:23] and he said can you see it can you see
[1:18:25] it no no I see you you're a young man
[1:18:29] Liz he said here I am with my gift I
[1:18:32] lift him up over the fence do you see it
[1:18:34] do you see it yeah yeah I see it now
[1:18:37] are those things true
[1:18:44] he gets a complex
[1:18:46] because after years and years and years
[1:18:49] of then Ministry of lifting people up
[1:18:52] and what good is it done
[1:18:53] tell their name where they come from
[1:18:56] even heal their bodies
[1:18:58] many have never even come back and say
[1:19:00] thank you
[1:19:04] as far as I'm concerned
[1:19:07] I'm going up into the mountains grow my
[1:19:09] hair long I'm gonna be a Trapper
[1:19:12] forget it
[1:19:13] God wants to send me into the valley
[1:19:16] I'll come down here give him thus saith
[1:19:18] the Lord go right back up
[1:19:22] do you know why God allowed that Prophet
[1:19:25] go beyond the curtain of time
[1:19:27] because he didn't see
[1:19:30] while he was alive
[1:19:32] churches like evening Light Fellowship
[1:19:36] Believers International
[1:19:39] he didn't see these churches around the
[1:19:41] world no sir a little man here and a
[1:19:44] little man over here and this one you're
[1:19:46] a great man of God even Billy Paul says
[1:19:48] I did not know who Daddy was until he
[1:19:51] died
[1:19:58] trying to do God a service
[1:20:02] 1965 in Jeffersonville
[1:20:05] I wonder today if all of your drawing in
[1:20:09] and great Crusades and revivals
[1:20:12] if we haven't been filling up the
[1:20:14] Methodist Arc the Baptist Arc the
[1:20:17] Presbyterian Ark
[1:20:20] but what about the Ark of Christ
[1:20:23] the word
[1:20:26] if the brightest to be the word then
[1:20:28] she's got to be of Christ
[1:20:30] part of the bridegroom she's got to be
[1:20:34] the word
[1:20:35] the word not for his day
[1:20:38] the word for this day
[1:20:41] that he promised
[1:20:43] would be this day
[1:20:45] that he sent his fourth sent his word
[1:20:48] forth to mold his bride and make her
[1:20:51] God has promised in his word
[1:20:54] that he would choose his bride in this
[1:20:56] last day
[1:20:57] did you know that
[1:20:59] is what God has done in this ladiesian
[1:21:02] age
[1:21:03] he sent his word
[1:21:06] Vindicated it by signs and wonders
[1:21:08] through the mouth of a prophet
[1:21:10] he sent his revealed word through the
[1:21:12] prophet of this hour
[1:21:14] but I'm going to warn you do not get
[1:21:16] your eyes focused on the vessel that God
[1:21:19] used
[1:21:20] because Moses was only a messenger
[1:21:24] Moses was following the pillar of Fire
[1:21:27] and I say unto you in this Third Exodus
[1:21:30] that we are having today yes we have a
[1:21:33] messenger but the messenger followed the
[1:21:35] pillar of Fire
[1:21:37] so the messenger was he would move and
[1:21:40] it moved is that right he would stop
[1:21:43] when it stopped
[1:21:44] hallelujah it's no different today but
[1:21:47] you don't get your eye on the messenger
[1:21:49] and they thought are you the Christ are
[1:21:51] you the Messiah he said I'm not
[1:21:54] in fact he said it's a lying ungodly lie
[1:21:58] of the devil don't you never believe
[1:21:59] that I'm Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] so he was Discerning Spirits were
[1:22:07] working within the church people that
[1:22:10] went to his own church
[1:22:12] how would you like to be sitting there
[1:22:14] Branham Tabernacles now about 150 people
[1:22:17] he said I've got 15 20 people sitting
[1:22:20] here right now believe I'm Jesus Christ
[1:22:23] how could they do it I went to him
[1:22:26] tried to show him in a word and he said
[1:22:27] if a spirit ever gets on you like that
[1:22:30] you'll absolutely believe it no matter
[1:22:32] what somebody tells you
[1:22:34] he said shows you are anointed
[1:22:37] with a wrong spirit
[1:22:42] churches
[1:22:44] have spirits
[1:22:53] don't get your eyes focused on the
[1:22:54] messenger
[1:22:56] but on his message
[1:22:59] for John the Baptist said I must
[1:23:01] decrease that he must increase
[1:23:04] he said
[1:23:06] the ministry that I have the baptism
[1:23:08] that I have is under repentance
[1:23:12] but he said there's one coming after me
[1:23:14] who's
[1:23:16] Ministry
[1:23:18] is far greater than mine
[1:23:21] his baptism is much greater I baptize
[1:23:24] you water unto repentance that's good
[1:23:26] I'm glad you heard the word you got
[1:23:28] baptized praise the Lord keep going
[1:23:33] but he said there's one coming after me
[1:23:35] whose baptism is far greater I'm not
[1:23:37] even worthy to take his shoes off
[1:23:42] for he'll baptize you with the Holy
[1:23:43] Ghost in fire
[1:23:45] fire is the greatest cleansing agent
[1:23:48] there is in the world today water is a
[1:23:50] universal solvent but it doesn't take
[1:23:52] away all the germs
[1:23:54] that's why they have an enclave in a
[1:23:56] dentist's office in a hospital or
[1:23:59] different places and you want to clean
[1:24:01] the tools they've been working on
[1:24:02] somebody else's dirty filthy teeth
[1:24:06] I'm Brian
[1:24:07] that's right
[1:24:10] you want them to use the same tools and
[1:24:12] not even clean them how about if they
[1:24:14] just rinse them in water
[1:24:18] you know what they do they put them in
[1:24:20] an enclave you know what that is
[1:24:22] that's a baptism of Fire
[1:24:25] they put them in there because they
[1:24:27] don't want any germs to come through
[1:24:31] right
[1:24:32] oh God what we need is a real baptism of
[1:24:35] Fire
[1:24:36] huh not just the cleansing of water
[1:24:40] but a baptism of Fire
[1:24:43] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:24:45] 1963 blind leaders of the blind
[1:24:49] God is not known by education he is not
[1:24:52] known by how to explain it
[1:24:54] God is known by a simplicity
[1:24:57] and of the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:25:00] the most illiterate person
[1:25:03] see not your theology it's a revelation
[1:25:07] of Jesus Christ
[1:25:09] in the Life of Christ is projecting
[1:25:11] itself through you
[1:25:13] with the preeminances to the people
[1:25:16] that they see the very life and works
[1:25:18] and signs and wonders that he did is
[1:25:20] doing the same thing through you
[1:25:24] outside of that the rest of it's not
[1:25:26] even called to at all
[1:25:28] Watch God's Great Revelation unfolding
[1:25:33] he says in paragraph 304 by the lack of
[1:25:37] this revelation
[1:25:38] is why we have so many different
[1:25:40] divisions among us and so much mockery
[1:25:45] so much division Among Us is because of
[1:25:47] people lack that Revelation what of the
[1:25:51] unfolding word
[1:25:55] Prophet began to see all the divisions
[1:25:57] called them Beaver preachers
[1:26:00] damning up the river of the holy spirit
[1:26:02] it's us flooring no more
[1:26:07] my pastor is greater and your pastor my
[1:26:09] dad can whip your dead
[1:26:12] we're losing our Simplicity that's in
[1:26:14] Christ
[1:26:15] if someone doesn't see it the way we see
[1:26:17] it it breaks our fellowship
[1:26:19] that ought to be
[1:26:23] First Corinthians 1 verses 10 through 15
[1:26:25] I beseech your brethren by the name of
[1:26:27] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:32] that you all speak the same thing
[1:26:36] wow he says I beseech you
[1:26:40] by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:43] you speak the same thing and let there
[1:26:45] be no divisions among you
[1:26:47] that you may be perfectly joined
[1:26:50] together in the same mind in the same
[1:26:52] judgment
[1:26:54] for it hath been declared unto me of you
[1:26:57] my brethren by them which are of the
[1:26:59] House of Chloe that there are
[1:27:01] contentions among you
[1:27:04] now this I say every one of you saith
[1:27:08] I'm of Paul and I am of Apollos I of
[1:27:12] cephas and I of Christ
[1:27:14] is Christ divided
[1:27:17] was Paul crucified for you
[1:27:22] or were you baptized in the name of Paul
[1:27:24] I thank God I baptize none of you
[1:27:27] but Christmas and guess
[1:27:30] any
[1:27:31] should say that I baptized him in my own
[1:27:34] name
[1:27:35] Paul's sick of the early church
[1:27:39] he comes in one born out of due season
[1:27:42] he comes in and spent three years after
[1:27:45] a divine intervention of God
[1:27:48] blinding him to open his eyes
[1:27:54] who then is Paul who's Apollos
[1:27:57] but ministers by whom you believed even
[1:27:59] as the Lord hath given every man I
[1:28:01] planted Apollos water but God gave the
[1:28:04] increase
[1:28:05] so then there is neither he that
[1:28:07] planteth anything neither he that
[1:28:09] whatareth but God that giveth the
[1:28:11] increase somebody say God gives the
[1:28:14] increase
[1:28:16] now he that planets and he that watereth
[1:28:19] are one and every man shall receive his
[1:28:21] own reward according to his own labor
[1:28:23] for we are laborers together with God
[1:28:27] and you're God's husbandry you are God's
[1:28:29] Building
[1:28:31] don't judge something because of its
[1:28:33] anointing
[1:28:35] anointings can fool you
[1:28:39] false Revelation is just as stimulating
[1:28:41] as true revelation
[1:28:47] I've told you before just very quickly a
[1:28:51] hunter and if you don't get Buck Fever
[1:28:53] when you get out there and you get among
[1:28:55] you see a big bull you shouldn't be
[1:28:56] hunting because I tell you what anybody
[1:28:58] that's a real Hunter all of a sudden man
[1:29:00] they see a big bull oh my
[1:29:05] my glasses would steam up I'd have to
[1:29:07] take them off
[1:29:10] get All Shook Up Man here he comes here
[1:29:12] he comes come on baby come on
[1:29:17] he went behind this big old tree
[1:29:20] and I saw his big old right side of his
[1:29:22] horns sticking out
[1:29:25] and it's moving I was like I got you
[1:29:27] just move
[1:29:29] and I have to keep pulling away from my
[1:29:31] scope to get my glasses and quit fogging

[1:29:56] was a branch
[1:29:59] I was so intent on looking to him coming
[1:30:02] out behind that tree I saw a branch and
[1:30:04] I thought that was it
[1:30:06] wasn't it was a branch
[1:30:08] he probably walked slowly right out into
[1:30:10] a broadside shot
[1:30:12] waiting for me to shoot him
[1:30:15] can I asked God to give them to me and I
[1:30:17] saw intent on my false Revelation I
[1:30:19] missed it
[1:30:23] it is yeah you get so excited that's it
[1:30:25] that's it okay I'm on it man I got it I
[1:30:28] got it
[1:30:30] I ain't got it
[1:30:32] you're like a
[1:30:38] lion dog
[1:30:40] barking up the wrong tree brother said
[1:30:42] you ever hunted a
[1:30:44] you have to know how they do it because

[1:30:48] by the nose they come off they go
[1:30:50] running they're all little pack of dogs
[1:30:52] and they're all no sniffers
[1:30:54] oh
[1:30:58] and they run run oh and they get around

[1:31:37] that tree we got him treated he's here
[1:31:39] we're gonna kill him
[1:31:40] he said and because that lion dog
[1:31:44] only went by his his smell and not by
[1:31:48] sight he said a good dog catches
[1:31:51] the scent up the tree and then goes he's
[1:31:55] up there
[1:31:57] and when he goes from limb to limb that
[1:32:00] dog follows him
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:06] otherwise they're all of the lion
[1:32:08] Prophets

[1:32:33] are you comfortable
[1:32:35] are you falling asleep on me
[1:32:38] okay don't fall asleep now
[1:32:42] all the early church was already
[1:32:44] struggling
[1:32:45] with false prophets
[1:32:48] coming in
[1:32:50] sowing their little seeded Discord
[1:32:51] pulling groups off this little group
[1:32:53] this little group
[1:32:56] now watch this first Corinthians 3
[1:32:58] follow along in your Bible if you can
[1:33:05] the early church were already struggling
[1:33:09] Paul came years after
[1:33:15] First Corinthians 3 verses one through
[1:33:17] nine and I Brethren could not speak to
[1:33:20] you as under spiritual but as unto
[1:33:23] carnal even us
[1:33:26] babes in Christ
[1:33:28] at least he gave him the benefit of the
[1:33:31] doubt that their babes in Christ
[1:33:36] think you're so spirit
[1:33:39] but you're so carnal you're
[1:33:41] so watch I have fed you with milk not
[1:33:45] with me for hitherto you are not able to
[1:33:47] Bear it neither yet now are you able
[1:33:52] for ye are yet carnal watch this

[1:38:21] while one says I'm Paul and another
[1:38:23] Apollos are you not
[1:38:25] I can't even call you guys spirit
[1:38:28] I want to just interject something here
[1:38:30] if you don't mind
[1:38:34] it's nine o'clock
[1:38:36] we're gonna go into overtime
[1:38:39] why are people so tossed about
[1:38:41] I want to ask you why are people so
[1:38:45] tossed about
[1:38:47] if you haven't heard the sermon go
[1:38:48] listen to it
[1:38:49] 1956 some people get the wrong
[1:38:52] impression of what the anointing is
[1:38:56] did you ever think of that
[1:38:58] what was the greatest anointing ever
[1:39:00] give to anyone
[1:39:02] and what did they do when they had that
[1:39:05] anointing
[1:39:06] the greatest anointing that was ever
[1:39:08] given to anyone was Jesus Christ
[1:39:12] we have the spirit by measure he had it
[1:39:15] without measure
[1:39:17] now the way we would think if such
[1:39:20] anointing was on him
[1:39:22] that had been prophesied 800 years
[1:39:25] before
[1:39:26] huh
[1:39:27] and when he was there and then the type
[1:39:30] of that anointing the full blessing and
[1:39:32] anointing of the Lord upon him we would
[1:39:35] want to run all over the building scream
[1:39:37] holler but the Bible said he laid down
[1:39:39] the scroll and sat down
[1:39:41] and precious words proceeded from his
[1:39:44] mouth that's what he did under the
[1:39:46] anointing
[1:39:48] the anointing is not emotions
[1:39:51] the anointing is supreme power in
[1:39:54] control
[1:39:56] like knowing exactly what and how
[1:40:00] wow
[1:40:02] Supreme anointing
[1:40:04] under control Supreme paw
[1:40:10] you see or I thank God that a prophet
[1:40:13] comes in here
[1:40:14] he says
[1:40:15] don't lose your simplicity
[1:40:17] that's in Christ
[1:40:20] amen
[1:40:24] First Corinthian Church the Corinthian
[1:40:25] Church they got problems
[1:40:28] Corinthian Church man they are so
[1:40:30] spiritual every time they get together
[1:40:31] one's got a Psalm one's got a hymn one's
[1:40:34] got a prophecy one's got a tongues
[1:40:37] wow these people are so spiritual watch
[1:40:39] what Paul says First Corinthians 14.
[1:40:43] verses 22-28
[1:40:46] wherefore tongues are for a sign not to
[1:40:48] them that believe
[1:40:50] but to them that believe not
[1:40:53] but prophesying servth not for them that
[1:40:56] believe not but for them which believe
[1:40:59] see the difference
[1:41:01] if the whole church coming together in
[1:41:03] one please and I'll speak with tongues
[1:41:05] then there come in those that are
[1:41:06] unlearned unbelievers will they not say
[1:41:08] you're mad
[1:41:10] but if all prophesy there come in one
[1:41:12] that believeth not or unlearned is he
[1:41:14] convinced of all he is judgable
[1:41:17] and thus are the secrets the heart made
[1:41:18] manifests and so falling down on his
[1:41:20] face he will worship God and report that
[1:41:23] God is in you of a truth how is it then
[1:41:26] Brethren watch this
[1:41:29] when you come together every one of you
[1:41:31] half the song
[1:41:32] half the doctrine half the tongue hath
[1:41:35] of Revelation hath an interpretation
[1:41:38] let all things be done
[1:41:40] unto edifying
[1:41:43] If any man speak in an unknown tongue
[1:41:45] Let It Be by two or at the most by three
[1:41:49] that by course let one interpret
[1:41:53] there be no interpretive letter and keep
[1:41:55] silence in the church and let them speak
[1:41:56] to himself and to God
[1:41:59] tongues are a sign
[1:42:02] not to the believer
[1:42:06] that's what he said
[1:42:09] now the Bible says
[1:42:11] I'll get in let me let me just give you
[1:42:12] a couple quotes and I'll back it up
[1:42:14] there with the scripture
[1:42:17] a lot easier in church
[1:42:21] then there's all this talk about the
[1:42:23] glacier
[1:42:25] the falling of the Holy Spirit anointing
[1:42:28] all over
[1:42:29] on the bride
[1:42:30] on the foolish virgin
[1:42:33] on seed and in on seed
[1:42:36] supposed to be the evidence of the
[1:42:37] baptismal he goes and people are
[1:42:40] thinking that we're in the midst of a
[1:42:41] great Revival
[1:42:43] Revival's over
[1:42:45] America had her last chance in 1957.
[1:42:49] now the tongues are God's sign of
[1:42:52] impending disaster
[1:42:56] um
[1:42:57] isn't it amazing how many of the
[1:43:00] ministers within the church are really
[1:43:02] talking a lot about tongues right now
[1:43:06] it's not to the believer
[1:43:11] let's read what brother Branham says
[1:43:13] it's a sign
[1:43:15] of impending disaster even as they were
[1:43:18] when there appeared on the Paul the wall
[1:43:20] of belshazzar's feast
[1:43:26] don't you know the last day Lord Lord
[1:43:28] we've done all these wonderful works and
[1:43:30] even cast out Devils will say depart
[1:43:32] from me you workers of iniquity
[1:43:35] you get a man that can come and pray for
[1:43:37] the sick get oil and blood appearing in
[1:43:38] the congregation prophesy coming forth
[1:43:41] in all manner of the Supernatural and
[1:43:43] the people will gather around him and
[1:43:44] swear that he is of the Lord
[1:43:46] even though he's actually making a money
[1:43:48] racket of religion and living in sin the
[1:43:50] only answer that he have is absolutely
[1:43:52] on on
[1:43:55] and
[1:43:57] unbiblical answer
[1:44:00] well we get results
[1:44:03] must be of God
[1:44:06] how terrible
[1:44:07] how actually poor this age is in the
[1:44:11] spirit of God and the poor poverty
[1:44:14] stricken ones don't even know it
[1:44:19] how can we be so spiritual and bring
[1:44:22] television back into the house
[1:44:27] do you know anybody who claims to be
[1:44:29] very
[1:44:30] hyper spiritual and revelated and got
[1:44:33] all kinds of wow bright Revelation and
[1:44:36] at home they got television
[1:44:41] we're losing our simplicity
[1:44:43] God help me he said now kick it out I
[1:44:46] remember one time we took our kids with
[1:44:47] us and some of the preachers had
[1:44:49] cornered Amos one time and because he's
[1:44:52] a preacher's kid hey what did what does
[1:44:54] your dad teach about television and what
[1:44:57] did Prophet say about it so Amos says
[1:44:59] yeah I know what he said I'll tell you
[1:45:00] what he says you take that television
[1:45:03] and you kick it outside
[1:45:05] and you watch it outside
[1:45:18] I
[1:45:19] we lost him
[1:45:21] at the first mall they made in Flagstaff
[1:45:23] for the big Flagstaff Mall next to the
[1:45:26] Rawson purina plant we're walking
[1:45:27] through there we've got all our kids in
[1:45:29] the line and somehow Sandy lost his
[1:45:32] little hand as we're walking the five of
[1:45:34] us walking through the mall we lost him
[1:45:36] that's a horrible feeling because you
[1:45:37] got your kid and all these people and
[1:45:39] where is he where is he and we start
[1:45:41] running back and everything and here's a
[1:45:42] whole wall
[1:45:43] of televisions
[1:45:47] they're all on the same channel
[1:45:51] I said Amos what are you doing
[1:45:54] I'm watching the radio
[1:46:05] we used to let him listen to the craft
[1:46:07] Mystery Theater
[1:46:09] you know
[1:46:11] and the door opened and the footprints
[1:46:15] who did that
[1:46:18] okay in the footprints
[1:46:22] okay and the kids would sit next to the
[1:46:24] radio and because it was so descriptive
[1:46:28] right
[1:46:29] well the TV it just you know so anyway
[1:46:32] I don't know why I said all that stuff
[1:46:33] except for the fact that hey we're
[1:46:36] losing our simplicity
[1:46:38] these things the Bible says if I bring
[1:46:42] in
[1:46:43] those things which I once destroyed
[1:46:46] I make myself
[1:46:48] a transgressor
[1:46:50] amen do you understand let's if brother
[1:46:54] Branham said the token applied to the
[1:46:56] home he kicked those things out
[1:46:59] well it's okay I'm more spiritual
[1:47:04] God help us huh I'm talking about losing
[1:47:07] our Simplicity in Christ
[1:47:09] amen
[1:47:13] so he says now you get these men and
[1:47:15] come come and pray for the uh this and
[1:47:19] people will follow him
[1:47:24] brother Graham says I want you to to
[1:47:26] watch a resume of the Ages page 377.
[1:47:30] to trace the two churches and the two
[1:47:33] Spirits from Pentecost to their
[1:47:35] consummation how many know he said the
[1:47:37] two Vines
[1:47:39] let's start in Genesis Exodus Leviticus
[1:47:42] Deuteronomy all the way down all the way
[1:47:44] to the Book of Revelation there it is
[1:47:46] the two Vines
[1:47:48] the two trees
[1:47:51] are we together on that he said watch
[1:47:54] the two Spirits now brother Branham says
[1:47:58] in resume of the ages
[1:48:00] as it was to be the age in which the
[1:48:04] true church would return to being the
[1:48:06] Bride As she was at Pentecost
[1:48:09] we know that there must of necessity be
[1:48:12] a return of dynamic power
[1:48:14] what seemed to be the answer came as
[1:48:16] many began to speak in tongues and
[1:48:19] manifest gifts of the Spirit
[1:48:21] it was then believed that this was
[1:48:24] indeed the long-awaited restoration
[1:48:27] it was not
[1:48:30] for the latter rain can only come after
[1:48:32] the former Reign which is the spring or
[1:48:34] teaching ring
[1:48:40] thus what was thought to be the
[1:48:42] restoration and the final quickening
[1:48:44] under the Rapture had not come
[1:48:46] listen to what he said here's your
[1:48:48] prophet
[1:48:49] it was a mixture of unrighteous
[1:48:51] partaking
[1:48:53] of spiritual blessing
[1:48:55] and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we
[1:48:58] kept pointing out to you
[1:49:00] and it also was devil power
[1:49:03] as men were under the control of devils
[1:49:08] are you listening
[1:49:11] yet no one seemed to realize it then to
[1:49:14] prove it was not the real
[1:49:16] these people even before a second
[1:49:18] generation appeared
[1:49:20] they organized they wrote their
[1:49:22] unscriptural doctrines built their own
[1:49:25] fences and as every other group did
[1:49:29] before them
[1:49:33] we're not going back to Pentecost
[1:49:35] Pentecost was in its day
[1:49:38] and God has gone beyond it
[1:49:40] many quotes I don't need to
[1:49:42] see when somebody tell you we're going
[1:49:44] back to no the Pentecost which Pentecost
[1:49:46] are you talking about
[1:49:47] Acts 2 or 1906.
[1:49:50] I want you to understand Pentecost is an
[1:49:52] experience with God you know what I am a
[1:49:55] Pentecost by birth
[1:49:57] amen I wasn't raised in the Pentecostal
[1:50:00] church but I am I have had my Pentecost
[1:50:04] Hallelujah I've been filled with the
[1:50:06] Holy Ghost
[1:50:07] and had I not been filled with the Holy
[1:50:09] Ghost I'd have been so vexed with people
[1:50:12] and places and things I'd have gotten an
[1:50:15] upset and all of the different ones
[1:50:17] because you know what who uh who hasn't
[1:50:21] been offended
[1:50:22] who hasn't had somebody say something
[1:50:25] against you and they claim to be the
[1:50:27] bride
[1:50:29] I'll tell you what
[1:50:31] when you go to fighting among yourselves
[1:50:33] and you go to Talking around your dinner
[1:50:36] table about others who don't see it just
[1:50:39] exactly like you your kids and stuff
[1:50:41] I'll look at you one day and say there
[1:50:43] ain't nothing to this mess
[1:50:46] because one day you may change your mind
[1:50:48] to say he's a great man of God he's
[1:50:50] preaching a sermon this weekend I ain't
[1:50:52] coming
[1:50:53] I done heard what you said about him
[1:50:56] or hypocrite
[1:50:58] see what I'm saying your kids you will
[1:51:02] sacrifice your kids
[1:51:06] because you don't talk
[1:51:08] where did Brother Branham said that the
[1:51:11] children learned old bald head old bald
[1:51:13] head
[1:51:14] he said from the parents around the
[1:51:16] dinner table
[1:51:18] so these kids came out and they saw that
[1:51:20] old bald-headed preacher coming down the
[1:51:23] way
[1:51:24] Ayo bald headed bald head you know when
[1:51:26] Mommy and Daddy said about you
[1:51:28] and he got so vexed he called two she
[1:51:30] Bears out he said that was not
[1:51:34] God to kill those children
[1:51:36] that was an angry prophet
[1:51:39] you done pressed his button
[1:51:43] touch not
[1:51:45] mind anointed and do my Prophets
[1:51:48] no harm
[1:51:50] amen
[1:51:51] they learned it around the dinner table
[1:51:53] God help us
[1:51:55] say good things
[1:51:57] if they don't see it the way you see it
[1:51:59] and they don't agree with you so what
[1:52:02] praise God they're your brother quit all
[1:52:04] of this fussing and fighting I'm a poem
[1:52:06] of Apollos are you not carnal
[1:52:12] we're losing our Simplicity I'm trying
[1:52:14] to bring it down I just got a little bit
[1:52:16] hear more bear with me for a moment
[1:52:20] Paul said after everything has been
[1:52:22] considered
[1:52:23] all of my former learning is done I tell
[1:52:26] you what I save that I know nothing
[1:52:28] except for him Christ and crucified
[1:52:33] that's all I know
[1:52:35] he took the whole gospel and brought it
[1:52:37] to a new Jesus Christ and him crucified
[1:52:40] amen
[1:52:42] he is the sinner
[1:52:44] of every scripture he is the theme
[1:52:48] of every chapter
[1:52:51] he is the Alpha and Omega from Genesis
[1:52:55] to Revelation it's all about
[1:52:59] him
[1:53:01] and him crucified
[1:53:03] and then your relationship
[1:53:13] brother REM says
[1:53:15] and I want to just say this how can we
[1:53:17] claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:53:18] and we fuss and Feud
[1:53:21] and we can't call another brother
[1:53:22] because he don't see it the way you see
[1:53:24] it
[1:53:25] you poor hypocrite
[1:53:28] brother Randolph said in 1955 where I
[1:53:33] think Pentecost failed
[1:53:37] if it ever gets to a place I couldn't
[1:53:39] put my arm
[1:53:40] around any brother that's working for
[1:53:42] the kingdom of God and recognize him as
[1:53:44] my brother I feel I'm backslid
[1:53:47] amen
[1:53:49] if we disagree a million miles on
[1:53:52] theology
[1:53:55] if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my
[1:53:57] brother and that's my sister
[1:54:00] and we've drawed those lines
[1:54:04] and if you can't you love your brother
[1:54:06] whom you have seen how can you love God
[1:54:08] whom you have not seen
[1:54:12] and brother
[1:54:14] when love goes out God goes with it
[1:54:17] amen for God is love and you can never
[1:54:20] get anywhere without Divine love
[1:54:23] and as you love one another you love God
[1:54:27] brother Rand makes a really bold
[1:54:29] statement and I love it he says God
[1:54:32] would rather have you to love one
[1:54:34] another than to love him
[1:54:38] um
[1:54:41] somebody's enjoying himself in there
[1:54:47] God would rather have you love one
[1:54:48] another
[1:54:50] than to love him because when you love
[1:54:52] one another
[1:54:53] you love him
[1:54:56] can you love the one that's sitting next
[1:54:58] to you
[1:54:59] can you love the one that maybe says all
[1:55:01] manner of evil against you that Jesus
[1:55:03] said do you only love those who love you
[1:55:06] why even the publicans do so you got
[1:55:09] public in religion you got Pharisee
[1:55:11] religion
[1:55:15] there's no reward in that
[1:55:18] love your enemy
[1:55:22] Love My Enemy
[1:55:24] oh God
[1:55:26] there's no way that I can do it
[1:55:29] myself
[1:55:31] I can't I'm human
[1:55:33] but there is a supernatural
[1:55:36] element inside of every one of us that
[1:55:39] we can forgive
[1:55:40] and we can
[1:55:42] huh love our brother
[1:55:48] love thinks no evil
[1:55:51] it's not proud
[1:55:53] puffed up
[1:55:58] love beareth all things
[1:56:06] for God is love
[1:56:10] Believers even family members
[1:56:13] will not even speak to one another
[1:56:15] because they don't agree on their
[1:56:18] opinion
[1:56:20] I was in Texas one time had a man that
[1:56:23] went to my church and his brother his
[1:56:25] physical brother in the message both of
[1:56:28] them believed in the message both of
[1:56:30] them loving the Lord both going to
[1:56:32] church both families are serving the
[1:56:34] lord in the message but one goes to one
[1:56:36] church and one another and one was the
[1:56:39] song leader of another church
[1:56:41] and because the two of them didn't agree
[1:56:44] an opinion one brother was working
[1:56:47] he needed to borrow a tool
[1:56:50] and he says hey he called his brother I
[1:56:52] forget his brother's name
[1:56:54] he said hey call me Mom Hey listen do
[1:56:57] you have one of those tools in your shed
[1:56:59] can I borrow it yeah yeah come on over
[1:57:01] come on over and get it
[1:57:03] when we were there I was with him we
[1:57:05] pulled up in the driveway in his car
[1:57:07] brother Ron you sit here I'll just go to
[1:57:09] the I'll go to the door and get it the
[1:57:11] brother
[1:57:13] look through the front door to his other
[1:57:16] brother
[1:57:17] oh it's you
[1:57:19] you can't come in
[1:57:21] I put it on the side door so go get it
[1:57:28] that's your brother
[1:57:29] happy birthday to you
[1:57:34] oh you got to be kidding me
[1:57:37] and they they would not they wouldn't
[1:57:39] they'd drive down the street and they
[1:57:40] see one another in a supermarket hey
[1:57:43] hey no no
[1:57:49] God take me
[1:57:53] home
[1:57:55] before I ever act like some religious
[1:57:58] Pharisee
[1:58:00] let me love
[1:58:02] let me love those who don't
[1:58:05] love me
[1:58:08] amen
[1:58:12] brother Branham said without Divine love
[1:58:14] you ain't gonna make it
[1:58:16] is that right
[1:58:20] watch what Paul said to the galatian
[1:58:22] church
[1:58:24] excuse me but I studied and I got this
[1:58:26] and I thought this this my last sermon I
[1:58:28] won't preach for another two and a half
[1:58:30] weeks or so
[1:58:32] Galatians 4 verses 14 through 16. and my
[1:58:35] Temptation which was in my flesh ye
[1:58:39] despised not nor rejected but receive me
[1:58:42] as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus
[1:58:45] Paul said you Galatians you received me
[1:58:47] even as Christ
[1:58:50] where then is the blessedness that you
[1:58:53] speak of
[1:58:55] I bear your record if it had been
[1:58:57] possible you would have plucked out your
[1:59:00] own eyes and given them to me
[1:59:04] it might therefore become your enemy
[1:59:08] because I tell you the truth
[1:59:11] wow from hero to zero
[1:59:15] all men have forsaken me
[1:59:19] isn't it amazing that how quickly
[1:59:23] we lose our simplicity
[1:59:26] brother Brenham and I got a whole study
[1:59:28] series I did on disagreeing with a
[1:59:30] brother
[1:59:31] can we disagree without being
[1:59:33] disagreeable
[1:59:35] sure
[1:59:36] well he's coming on a white horse ah no
[1:59:40] he's not coming on White Cloud
[1:59:42] well who cares
[1:59:44] that's some theological discussion it
[1:59:47] really it doesn't matter it has nothing
[1:59:48] to do with your Eternal salvation
[1:59:53] musicians come
[2:00:03] this is not the scripture says
[2:00:06] though I give my body to be burned
[2:00:09] though I have all faith I can move
[2:00:12] mountains though I understand all the
[2:00:15] Mysteries
[2:00:19] you know and he says all these things
[2:00:21] and I have not loved
[2:00:23] I am sounding brass tinkling symbols
[2:00:27] and I myself might be a Castaway
[2:00:32] oh I understand the great revelation of
[2:00:34] God and you don't love your brother who
[2:00:37] disagrees with you
[2:00:40] I tell you right now you can go make it
[2:00:43] because without Divine love
[2:00:47] perfect love
[2:00:49] covers a multitude
[2:00:55] well I'll tell you you want to know
[2:00:56] about brother so-and-so you know what I
[2:00:58] think of him you know what he did
[2:01:03] pray for him
[2:01:05] that's the talking
[2:01:07] [Music]
[2:01:08] I started with the the title
[2:01:12] vein talkers unruly
[2:01:15] deceivers
[2:01:19] we put bits in horses mouths
[2:01:22] that they might obey us we put a great
[2:01:24] helm
[2:01:26] on a big ship
[2:01:28] if we can make it go where we want it to
[2:01:30] go but who can Bridle the tongue
[2:01:33] [Music]
[2:01:36] with that same tongue we can bless God
[2:01:38] and we can sing the Praises of God and
[2:01:41] turn right around and say I'm glad I'm
[2:01:43] not like him
[2:01:45] [Music]
[2:01:47] how dare we ever look down our noses
[2:01:51] or compare ourselves one to another
[2:01:53] because the Bible says measuring
[2:01:55] themselves by themselves are they
[2:02:02] which one of you are
[2:02:06] you are so holy that you look down at
[2:02:08] everybody else because they don't see it
[2:02:11] just like you
[2:02:17] it 'll be Saints
[2:02:20] that's what Paul was telling him here he
[2:02:23] come to the very first church age when
[2:02:24] Pentecost was right there just a few
[2:02:27] decades away
[2:02:30] they've seen the signs and wonders
[2:02:32] they've seen all of this
[2:02:34] and yet how quickly the enemy comes in
[2:02:38] the cares of Life choked the seed
[2:02:41] becomes unfruitful we lose our
[2:02:43] simplicity
[2:02:46] [Music]
[2:02:48] I'm not looking for all the ministers
[2:02:50] and the message to agree with me and to
[2:02:52] see it exactly the way I see it
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:56] God demands that I love
[2:03:00] without dissimulation
[2:03:05] how about you
[2:03:07] [Music]
[2:03:12] are you one of those that love only
[2:03:14] those who love you that's Pharisee
[2:03:17] religion
[2:03:19] [Music]
[2:03:23] thank you
[2:03:27] we're not careful what we do is we hand
[2:03:28] pick all the preachers that we like
[2:03:31] because they agree with us so that's the
[2:03:33] only ones we have to our convention
[2:03:36] let me tell you
[2:03:38] there are the No Name
[2:03:43] little preachers that have little
[2:03:45] churches than their Ministries all over
[2:03:49] the world
[2:03:54] sometimes we miss one of the greatest
[2:03:56] blessings because he's a new name
[2:04:01] I never heard of him where's he go where
[2:04:04] is he from
[2:04:08] I love to have
[2:04:10] a cross-section and fivefold Ministry in
[2:04:13] my Pulpit whether they agree with me or
[2:04:16] not
[2:04:18] because you know what they're special
[2:04:20] gifts and they have certain viewpoints
[2:04:22] and certain certain things that they see
[2:04:24] and what amazes me I could have preached
[2:04:27] on a certain Doctrine for years and
[2:04:30] covered it but they come from a
[2:04:32] different angle here's the Evangelist
[2:04:34] brother representative evangelist with a
[2:04:36] special gift gets up there and tears it
[2:04:37] up and he's this and that I'll get
[2:04:39] people to the altar I think man I've
[2:04:42] done preached that for years and oh
[2:04:45] brother Ron thank you for having brother
[2:04:46] and so I never heard that before in my
[2:04:49] life where were you
[2:04:51] must have been the day you're sleeping
[2:04:54] you're intercessing
[2:04:59] [Music]
[2:05:02] that's good that's not only good for you
[2:05:04] it's good for me
[2:05:06] well I don't see it that way that's okay
[2:05:09] praise the Lord if we had an accident
[2:05:12] right here on Mountain View in front of
[2:05:15] the church after church and all of you
[2:05:17] was out there and you heard
[2:05:19] and you saw the accident you saw the
[2:05:21] cars spin around and the uh and the
[2:05:24] officer says was you out front did you
[2:05:25] see that accident yes I did what is your
[2:05:27] name I want to know your name your age
[2:05:29] where you're from this and that did you
[2:05:31] see the accident yes sir I did okay what
[2:05:34] did you hear I heard the this the the
[2:05:36] Screech of the tires I saw the Red Hawk
[2:05:39] car hit the white car was you there oh
[2:05:41] yes yes I was uh-huh what did you see
[2:05:43] well I saw that the white car hit the
[2:05:46] yellow car and then the red car and then
[2:05:49] I heard discrete wait a second
[2:05:52] but that's different than what he heard
[2:05:54] and you were there too oh yeah what is
[2:05:57] your name uh-huh yeah well you must be a
[2:06:00] liar because you are not seeing exactly
[2:06:02] what those two saw but you saw it
[2:06:04] and you too uh-huh
[2:06:08] and so in the midst of all of these
[2:06:11] eyewitnesses there is a truth
[2:06:14] [Music]
[2:06:20] otherwise the cop will say I'll tell you
[2:06:23] uh you're a liar because he said this
[2:06:27] and don't match you did you I thought
[2:06:28] you said you was there I what
[2:06:31] well then why don't it match exactly
[2:06:34] because maybe you just had a different
[2:06:36] viewpoint
[2:06:39] maybe you didn't see
[2:06:43] your angle you saw the car he didn't see
[2:06:46] it because he's on this side
[2:06:47] and he saw the white car getting this
[2:06:49] and bumped it caused the red car to hit
[2:06:51] the yellow car
[2:06:52] I'm just making up a hypothetical
[2:06:55] right
[2:06:56] so in the midst of all of this
[2:06:59] there is a truth
[2:07:01] so there's all kinds of eyewitnesses all
[2:07:04] kinds of opinions and theories and
[2:07:07] I wasn't there I never was in a
[2:07:11] [Music]
[2:07:16] help me
[2:07:19] [Music]
[2:07:20] I lost my train of thought
[2:07:24] that's okay I'm over 70. it's gone
[2:07:26] hyperspace
[2:07:29] done got me shooked up I guess it's time
[2:07:31] let's all Stand Together praise the Lord
[2:07:34] that must have been a sign from heaven
[2:07:37] time to quit
[2:07:40] okay I got the message Lord I'm not
[2:07:43] trying to be funny saints of God there's
[2:07:45] a very very serious
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:49] we lose our simplicity
[2:07:52] cannot I love
[2:07:56] and have compassion
[2:07:58] sympathy on those who don't see it the
[2:08:01] way I see it
[2:08:04] brother Brown said I can't get my wife
[2:08:07] to agree with me on everything
[2:08:10] [Music]
