[10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no one else like him this
[10:26] morning. Amen. We trust in him today to
[10:30] answer our request and to be of the
[10:32] burdens of our heart. He's a good God.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's already provided. Then we'll
[10:36] read our needs today. If you didn't have
[10:38] a chance to write your knee down, he
[10:40] knows your heart this morning. He's
[10:43] already
[10:44] [Music]
[10:46] proided.
[10:49] He's already
[10:54] proided.
[10:56] [Music]
[10:58] And every need you need, he's already
[11:04] [Music]
[11:11] every promise you can claim.
[11:16] This is what you got to do. Just ask it
[11:19] in his name.
[11:24] everything you need.
[11:28] He's already
[11:30] providing.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that this morning we
[11:35] have several needs that we'd like to
[11:37] mention this morning. First, a praise
[11:39] report. Brother Russell Wallace sent me
[11:40] a text this morning. Asked me to read an
[11:43] update from his doctor's visit. This is
[11:45] Friday. He says, "I went to the doctor
[11:47] this morning for a pathology report. I
[11:49] have a perfect report. The doctor uh had
[11:52] taken out a bunch of the closest lymph
[11:55] nodes and had them biopsied once again
[11:57] looking for anything that might have
[11:59] spread. Nothing zero zil total
[12:02] deliverance from the Lord. And I'm
[12:03] thanking the Lord for that. We rejoice
[12:06] with brother Russell this morning.
[12:09] We rejoice with him and his
[12:13] guiding the surgeon's hand and touching
[12:15] him and removing all the cancer that was
[12:17] in his prostate. So we thank the Lord
[12:19] for that.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have several need. We have
[12:21] three needs written down this morning.
[12:23] Uh we ask brother Pierre Verquest if he
[12:26] will come and take our needs to the Lord
[12:27] today. He has a testimony from
[12:29] unanswered prayer that he would like to
[12:31] testify this morning. My mother-in-law,
[12:33] Barb, sister Barbara Yarro, she's here
[12:35] today and she has a request today. It
[12:37] says, "Please pray for my youngest son,
[12:39] Joseph. He has some medical issues and
[12:42] he doesn't want to have any more tests.
[12:44] However, the di diagnosis that he has
[12:47] conditioned is requiring a PET scan.
[12:50] It's a PET scan. At this time, Joseph
[12:53] says he doesn't want to get one. Please
[12:55] pray for Joseph that he'll change his
[12:57] mind and he can get this diagnosis.
[12:59] Thank you much, Sister Barbara Yro. So,
[13:01] let's remember our son Joseph this
[13:03] morning. We want to remember the saints
[13:05] that are traveling. There's quite a few
[13:06] saints that are traveling. Sister Ramona
[13:09] Aldco says, "Please remember my
[13:11] son-in-law, Dwayne." Dwayne will be
[13:14] having surgery on Wednesday to remove a
[13:17] new cancer growth. I'm asking God to be
[13:20] with Dwayne and to guide the doctor's
[13:22] hands. Also, prayer for Vanessa, his
[13:24] wife, and their kids for God to help
[13:26] them through this trial. And also
[13:28] Dwayne's mother, her name is Pat. This
[13:30] has been very hard on all of them. So,
[13:32] let's remember them this morning. Do you
[13:34] have a need today that you'd like to
[13:36] present to him one more time as brother
[13:38] Pierre comes? He's already provided.
[13:40] Lift your need and sing. He's already
[13:45] proided.
[13:46] [Music]
[13:47] He's already
[13:52] proided.
[13:56] Every name you need, he's already
[14:02] proided.
[14:04] Every promise you can claim,
[14:08] every proise you can claim,
[14:15] just ask it in his name.
[14:21] Everything
[14:22] you need,
[14:26] he's already provided.
[14:32] God bless you saints.
[14:34] I had uh a little testimony to my wife
[14:39] and my sister went to Mexico
[14:42] about uh about 3 weeks now. Um
[14:46] a couple things happened there and then
[14:48] and I just wanted to give God the glory.
[14:53] Just wanted to start with the quick
[14:54] scripture here. Matthew 10:32.
[14:57] So everyone who acknowledges me before
[14:59] men, I will acknowledge before my father
[15:02] who is in heaven. So I believe, you
[15:05] know, we shouldn't hold these
[15:06] testimonies to ourselves. And um
[15:08] hopefully it's edifying for you. And um
[15:12] so just to make it brief, there's a lot
[15:14] of details, so I'll make it short, but
[15:16] uh so about a week, 3 weeks last
[15:19] Wednesday, uh her uncle was really sick.
[15:21] Uh they didn't give him much time.
[15:24] Doctors pretty much gave up on him. uh a
[15:27] lot of complications, a lot of water in
[15:29] his body and his uh heart had enlarged
[15:33] so they didn't give him much time. So,
[15:35] she left that weekend um after the
[15:38] prayer request and um uh when she got
[15:41] there um it was uh I think it was
[15:44] Saturday uh no Sunday sorry Sunday night
[15:47] she got there and um he was already
[15:49] feeling a lot better almost 50% better
[15:52] um just because of your prayers and uh
[15:55] so he's she's been testifying to his uh
[15:58] to her um aunt and and her uncle about
[16:01] the message and so little by little
[16:03] they've been accepting it and um so I
[16:06] believe there's a work being done there.
[16:07] So just keep praying for them. Um that's
[16:10] one testimony. The second one is the one
[16:12] that really is a miracle. Um so before
[16:15] she left, you know, we always check the
[16:17] car, check the water, the fluids, and
[16:19] everything, and she just got uh we put
[16:21] new tires on her vehicle just to get
[16:23] there cuz you know, Mexico, you got to
[16:25] make sure you know your tires are good.
[16:27] So um there's a lot of debris, a lot of
[16:30] potholes, and a lot of stuff. even
[16:32] though they re revamped the streets and
[16:34] the highways are they're better now but
[16:37] so about 7 hours from Ngalas into you
[16:41] know south Mexico there so that's how
[16:43] far her that little town is so um while
[16:48] she got there you know they so it was
[16:51] about that Monday they were they got
[16:54] there um and then Thursday all till
[16:58] Thursday there was a an issue with the
[17:01] higher.
[17:02] And the way it started was that they had
[17:05] gone to another little town where some
[17:07] of her family members were there and she
[17:09] visit them and on the way back coming to
[17:12] the town where her uncle's at uh there
[17:14] was uh they they hit a pothole
[17:18] and uh and noticed that tire pressure
[17:20] had gone down a couple pounds and so
[17:23] that was just an indication that hey,
[17:25] you know, maybe something happened to
[17:27] the tire. Um, and it was only the one
[17:29] tire. And as they got there, they went
[17:32] um they told my brother-in-law, he's he
[17:35] lives there as well. And uh they went to
[17:37] the tire shop and found a nail on that
[17:40] tire. Um, and what the miracle is that
[17:44] when the tire man took the tire, it was
[17:48] already missing one lug nut and there
[17:51] was only four left. And when he went to
[17:52] go get the tire just to put the tool on
[17:54] it, the four lug nuts fell to the
[17:56] ground.
[17:57] So, it's a miracle that tire stayed on
[18:01] all that time. Um, uh, so he got in
[18:04] there, he he took the nail out. And the
[18:06] other miracle thing is that the the the
[18:08] nail was not punctured all the way into
[18:10] the tire. It was just it could folded
[18:12] upon itself and the head of the nail
[18:15] just slightly punctured the tire just
[18:16] enough so it could drop a couple pounds.
[18:18] And and how mindful Lord is to to tell
[18:21] you, "Hey, look at this tire because
[18:22] you're going to have to tie it down."
[18:25] you know, uh, and the tires, they just
[18:27] lightly patched it as good. They put it
[18:29] back on and and, uh, went checked all
[18:31] the other lug nuts. Um, but that's just
[18:34] a miracle that that tire did not fall
[18:36] off. You know, loaded vehicle, winding
[18:38] roads, potholes, you know, speed bumps.
[18:42] Um, so I just want to give God the
[18:43] glory. Uh, and and for anyone, you know,
[18:46] just he's mindful of us, you know, and
[18:49] and sometimes we wonder if he's with us
[18:51] and and he is. And especially if you
[18:54] bring him first in prayer and we pray
[18:57] diligently before she left um that God
[19:00] would take care of the car and take care
[19:01] of the tires and take care. It's very
[19:03] important saints. Um bring it bring it
[19:05] to him and he will he will guide you.
[19:07] His angels will be there to keep that
[19:08] tire in place.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; So we just want to give God the glory
[19:12] and thank you for your prayers. She she
[19:14] wanted to tell you guys, sister Naomi
[19:16] that thank you for the prayers for her
[19:17] uncle. And actually yesterday he got a
[19:19] she got a call that he's actually
[19:21] standing up now. So So, well, he was bed

[27:00] &gt;&gt; He has given me my wife
[27:03] and given me my children
[27:06] and grandkids
[27:09] given me a work
[27:12] and given me brothers and sisters as
[27:14] well.
[27:16] Even so, as the Bible declares,
[27:19] God has loved the world
[27:22] that he's given his only son. So whoever
[27:25] believes in him
[27:28] may have eternal life.

[56:00] been two years and five months since he
[56:02] has been unable to attend to the church
[56:05] and be the guy to unlock and come and do
[56:08] everything that he had done so fa
[56:10] faithfully for years. He is now back at
[56:13] his post of duty and he's doing that.

[56:18] God bless you. Love you, buddy.
[56:26] Did you get your new set of prosthetic
[56:28] legs? You did. They're there. Okay,
[56:30] that's good deal. Uh he said they're
[56:33] supposed to be better than the first
[56:34] ones that he got and stuff. But I wanted
[56:37] to say also to a as a request from the
[56:41] pastor to all of you parents and the
[56:44] little children, there's been several
[56:46] times in uh our children, you know, they
[56:49] just they they're they're so lively and
[56:52] everything and they love to just kind of
[56:53] get out and run around and chase one
[56:55] another, but they do that among the the
[56:57] elders and have almost knocked over
[56:59] brother Neil a time or two.
[57:02] And uh uh so I want you to be extremely
[57:07] aware now young people, little ones,
[57:09] listen to brother Ron. Uh do your
[57:12] running on the grass. Not among the
[57:15] elders. I would not want of our older
[57:18] sisters. It's happened to several of our
[57:21] uh older sisters here too and older
[57:24] brothers. said, uh, as you get older,
[57:26] you get a little more unsure of yourself
[57:29] and and you know, you make sure that you
[57:32] watch every step. I do that now. You
[57:35] know, I I was getting off of the ferry
[57:38] and you go down the steps in the little
[57:40] ramp and I'm watching every step because
[57:43] I don't want to miss that one step. So
[57:46] anyway, just a note to all of you, would
[57:48] you please be very mindful of our elders
[57:51] and the different ones, all of us, okay?
[57:55] That uh we'll watch our children and
[57:57] we'll make sure that they can play on
[57:58] the grass and um all of that. So I
[58:01] appreciate it and uh
[58:05] Amen. Now, the Lord's been dealing with
[58:08] me. was up in Canada
[58:11] and uh Alaska
[58:16] and in prayer and meditation one
[58:18] morning. It it's just come very very
[58:21] strong in my heart of what I'll be
[58:23] preaching this morning. And u I'm not
[58:27] finished with the warfare of the end
[58:30] time at Laiusa. I will launch off into
[58:33] that in the next service or two. But uh
[58:39] the Lord was dealing on my heart and I
[58:41] in fellowship with the brethren up there
[58:43] in Canada.
[58:45] We were just fellowshipping. I said God
[58:47] dealt with me and I said uh uh I want to
[58:51] I says when I get back home I said I
[58:53] want to preach on this and when I told
[58:56] him that uh I felt his presence.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; He just came sweetly by.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love his presence? Amen.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Don't you love it that when you make
[59:07] mention of him and you just feel that
[59:09] sweet presence?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together this morning if
[59:14] you would.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; He's all I need.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[59:19] &gt;&gt; is all I need.
[59:23] Yes, he's all
[59:26] I need.
[59:29] He's all
[59:32] I need.
[59:36] Jesus
[59:39] is all
[59:41] I need.
[59:45] [Music]
[59:47] &gt;&gt; He is all
[59:50] I need.
[59:53] He is all
[59:56] I need.
[1:00:00] Jesus
[1:00:02] is all
[1:00:05] I need.
[1:00:09] Heavenly Father, now as we come to this
[1:00:12] portion of the service and we open up
[1:00:15] your holy scriptures,
[1:00:18] we would ask Father for a divine
[1:00:20] anointing, an inspiration that would
[1:00:23] come from on high.
[1:00:25] And I would ask Lord Jesus that you
[1:00:28] would show us another great portion of
[1:00:30] the great plan of redemption.
[1:00:34] And Father, I thank you that thou has
[1:00:37] prepared a place and a people to go to a
[1:00:41] place for you're a Jehovah Gyra God.
[1:00:46] You're the one that provides all our
[1:00:48] needs.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; So we rest in that. We have assurance
[1:00:53] this morning
[1:00:56] that you have prepared a place for a
[1:01:00] people and we thank you for that.
[1:01:02] Father, I pray now that you will bless
[1:01:05] your word. Speak to our hearts as only
[1:01:08] you can. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[1:01:11] name.
[1:01:13] Amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around, shake somebody's
[1:01:16] hand, and say, "God bless you." Yes.
[1:01:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:21] Praise the Lord. Thank you musicians
[1:01:23] each and everyone. Song specials were
[1:01:25] great. The Baya family. Amen. Brother
[1:01:28] Jean Pierre comes all the way here. Jean
[1:01:30] Pierre, God bless you. 60 years old. His
[1:01:33] family up here and and uh singing. I
[1:01:37] appreciate that. Amen. And u also we
[1:01:42] have two Johnny Greens here. We have one
[1:01:44] Johnny Green back there and we have one
[1:01:45] Johnny Green up here. and he's on the
[1:01:47] front row and his daughter is here uh
[1:01:49] with him. And God bless you, Johnny, you
[1:01:51] and your daughters. Good to have you
[1:01:52] here with us. Amen. How many of you are
[1:01:55] excited for uh the ministry of the word?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Because that's what it's all
[1:02:00] about.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. Because what you've done out
[1:02:04] there and all week and the money you've
[1:02:05] made and all that, that's okay. That's
[1:02:07] good. But what you do in here has
[1:02:10] eternal ramifications.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mal Malachi 3.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; And verse one. And then we'll go to
[1:02:18] Isaiah chapter 40. Then we'll go to John
[1:02:22] chapter 14.
[1:02:24] Amen.
[1:02:32] Praise be to God.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Malachi 3
[1:02:38] and verse one. Behold, I will send my
[1:02:41] messenger,
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; and he shall prepare the way before me,
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; and the Lord whom you seek shall
[1:02:50] suddenly come to his temple,
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; even the messenger of the covenant,
[1:02:56] whom ye delight in, behold, he shall
[1:02:59] come, saith the Lord of hosts.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Turn with me back to the book of Isaiah.
[1:03:06] Isaiah chapter 40
[1:03:10] verses 3-5.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; We know there are types and shadows all
[1:03:21] through the scriptures.
[1:03:23] And we see that God always uses
[1:03:25] messengers.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; He sends angels.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; He sends messengers. It's extremely
[1:03:33] important
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; to recognize
[1:03:36] your day and its message.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Good to see what God has done.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Good to see what God will do.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; But what is most important is see what
[1:03:47] God is doing. A current God
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:03:52] today, and forever.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 40:es 3 through 5. The
[1:04:00] voice of him that crith in the
[1:04:01] wilderness,
[1:04:04] prepare ye the way of the Lord,
[1:04:07] make straight in the desert a highway
[1:04:10] for our God.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every valley shall be exalted, and
[1:04:15] every mountain and hill shall be made
[1:04:17] low, and the crooked shall be made
[1:04:21] straight, and the rough places plain.
[1:04:27] And the glory of the Lord shall be
[1:04:29] revealed,
[1:04:30] and all the flesh shall see it together,
[1:04:34] for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. the voice of him that
[1:04:41] crith in the wilderness.
[1:04:45] When they asked John when he came,
[1:04:48] they said, "Are you he?"
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; "Are you the one?" He said, "No."
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Then they said, "Then tell us who you
[1:04:56] are
[1:04:58] that we might give an account to those
[1:05:00] who sent us."
[1:05:04] He said, "I'm the voice
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; of one crying in the wilderness."
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; what he did, he identified his ministry
[1:05:11] with scripture.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; He placed himself.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Who are you? Tell us.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Are you the one? No.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; But I am a voice.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the voice.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; St. John 14:es
[1:05:29] 1-4.
[1:05:32] St. John 14
[1:05:37] verses 1-4.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Let not your heart be troubled.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; You believe in God,
[1:05:53] believe also in me.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions.
[1:06:01] If it were not so, I would have told
[1:06:03] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[1:06:09] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[1:06:11] I will come again
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; and receive you unto myself
[1:06:17] that where I am.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Wherever that be, Lord, I want to be
[1:06:26] there.
[1:06:30] that where I am,
[1:06:33] there ye may be also,
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; and whether I go ye know, and the way ye
[1:06:41] know.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word.
[1:06:43] You may be seated this morning in the
[1:06:45] presence of God.
[1:06:52] Amen.
[1:06:53] I would like to title my sermon this
[1:06:57] morning, a prepared place
[1:07:00] for a prepared people.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Preparation's important.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Everything in life talks about
[1:07:07] preparation.
[1:07:09] You need to be prepared because if you
[1:07:11] do not prepare
[1:07:13] and you are unprepared,
[1:07:16] you will have many failures, many
[1:07:19] mistakes, many problematic areas because
[1:07:23] you weren't prepared.
[1:07:29] And
[1:07:30] so I'm speaking on a prepared place
[1:07:35] for a prepared people.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to take this subject this
[1:07:43] morning. The bride is making herself
[1:07:46] ready.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; The responsibility.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; The messenger has come. He has spoken.
[1:07:54] He's given us thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; And it's not just hearing what he said,
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; but it's being obedient to what has been
[1:08:03] spoken.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Become not a forgetful
[1:08:08] hearer." That you go straight way and
[1:08:10] well, I I forgot. Uh well, tell me
[1:08:13] again.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; God, help us to be obedient
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; hearers that we hear something. And I've
[1:08:20] always said this, it's not just the
[1:08:23] words, but I want the understanding.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; I want to hear the voice behind the
[1:08:30] voice.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; I want to hear the voice behind the
[1:08:33] veil.
[1:08:37] And let me just take this now and say
[1:08:42] that this prepared place
[1:08:46] I I want to speak about that and I
[1:08:50] cherish the thought that he says I have
[1:08:54] a place prepared.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; How comforting that should be to every
[1:09:01] Christian.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. who because you're on a journey
[1:09:06] down here. And let me tell you, don't
[1:09:08] ever set your set your tent pigs too
[1:09:12] deep here cuz you know what?
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; We're in the feast of tabernacles and
[1:09:16] it's a temporary
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; temporary dwelling place. Thank God,
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; that our kingdom is not of this world.
[1:09:26] We sink in another kingdom.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; One that's not ruled by
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; these kind of laws and governments and
[1:09:34] things and all of that. But we have
[1:09:37] another kingdom that is so far greater
[1:09:39] than this one.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I not only want to talk about
[1:09:46] a prepared place,
[1:09:50] but how about a people
[1:09:53] prepared
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; for that place
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; because I want to make it personal
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; I want to bring it down home.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; So there were several things that Jesus
[1:10:09] said there in St. John 14.
[1:10:15] and I measure his words. He said, "The
[1:10:17] words that I speak to you, they are
[1:10:20] spirit
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; and they are life."
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; He that heareth my words and believeth
[1:10:25] on him that sent me has everlasting
[1:10:28] life. Amen.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; But though there were thousands of
[1:10:34] people that heard Jesus speak,
[1:10:39] there were only few that understood what
[1:10:43] he was talking about. That's right.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; So, with all of your getting, with all
[1:10:48] of your listening,
[1:10:50] and with all of your reading, and all of
[1:10:52] your listening to tapes, whatever you
[1:10:55] do, get some understanding of what
[1:10:57] you're listening to.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Several points. One is in my father's
[1:11:04] house. Now the word house the prophet of
[1:11:06] God said is kind of translated in a
[1:11:10] incorrect way that when we think of a
[1:11:12] house in my father's house are many
[1:11:14] mansions. So his house must be a lot of
[1:11:17] square footage.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; It's pretty big. This big old house.
[1:11:21] He's got mansions inside the house. But
[1:11:24] it's actually it means in my father's
[1:11:27] domain
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; in my father's kingdom. And my father's
[1:11:32] place where he lives
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; are places I've prepared.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; It's custom.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Eye has not seen
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; nor ear heard what God has prepared
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; for his people. Thank God.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I'll tell you, it'll be
[1:11:57] beyond your wildest
[1:11:59] imagination. It'll be beyond sublime.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; It'll be beyond perfect.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; I just
[1:12:12] I guess it just warms my heart when I
[1:12:14] think
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; that my God thinks so much of me.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; I have prepared a place.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; My thank God for that place.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:12:31] and he says, I've prepared a place for
[1:12:33] you. Now, it puts us now into the
[1:12:35] equation.
[1:12:39] He is not only the architect,
[1:12:43] but he's also the general contractor.
[1:12:46] Yes.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; His laborers that are working for him
[1:12:52] are subcontractors.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And they all better build according to
[1:12:58] his plan. Because even Paul said, "Let
[1:13:00] every man take heed how he builds on
[1:13:03] this foundation."
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:13] And he says another point, I will come
[1:13:16] again and receive you.
[1:13:20] Talks about his second coming.
[1:13:22] He said, well, I've come and I've come
[1:13:25] and I've paid the price for redemption.
[1:13:29] He says redemption has two parts. Coming
[1:13:31] out
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; and going into.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:37] And may I declare unto all of you this
[1:13:40] morning, and I trust it's happening to
[1:13:42] you as it's happening to me. And that is
[1:13:46] we're entering into
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; another stage of the ministry. Not we're
[1:13:54] talking we're not talking about just
[1:13:55] five-fold ministry.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a ministry.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the body
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. And each one of you
[1:14:06] members in particular, and you say,
[1:14:08] "Well, I'm nobody big. I'm just a small
[1:14:10] part." But I'll tell you, did not Jesus
[1:14:12] say that even the smaller parts
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; are of great significance? When you look
[1:14:18] at a watch and you see the hands in the
[1:14:20] face and the numbers and all that, you
[1:14:22] don't see the integral part of something
[1:14:24] moving behind the scene.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; You don't see the people praying for the
[1:14:28] ministry. if you don't see the ones that
[1:14:30] are there, that are uh cleaning the
[1:14:33] church, that are doing the audio, that
[1:14:35] are doing all of the stuff, that are
[1:14:37] working and praying. And
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, some of you may
[1:14:41] never preach a sermon behind a pulpit,
[1:14:43] but may God use you to be a living
[1:14:47] epistle, to be a sermon preached to your
[1:14:50] neighbors, to your friends, and to your
[1:14:52] family.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And the fourth part is where I am. Where
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; there you will be with me also.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; My
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; there's something about just being with
[1:15:15] dad.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; When I was a kid, if you're with dad,
[1:15:21] I never asked, "Do you got enough money?
[1:15:24] All right.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Is there gas in the car?
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; What if we have a flat?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Are you going to get lost? Do you know
[1:15:30] where you're going?
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; I just sat back. I'm a dad.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; I'm along for the ride.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; I'm just enjoying it. Why?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz my father took care
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; of all of the needs.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; And so, I want all of you to sit back
[1:15:53] and relax.
[1:15:55] Your father knows
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; what you have need of
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; and he will provide.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; When you come against a wall, he'll make
[1:16:03] a way.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; When he comes against the Red Sea, he
[1:16:06] will open it up. When storms come, he
[1:16:09] will calm the storm. Let me tell you, he
[1:16:11] is Jehovah, God,
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; and he will provide all of your needs,
[1:16:16] not your wants,
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; not maybe your desires.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. You may want a Mercedes and God
[1:16:25] gives you a Volkswagen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Just be happy. Guess what?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Or the Lamborghini or the Ferrari. And
[1:16:33] guess what? Those guys, they spend all
[1:16:34] that money and they race off of the line
[1:16:36] like so many people do in the traffic.
[1:16:40] They speed it. You catch up to them in
[1:16:42] the next two minutes.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; He's wasted all that time, that gas, and
[1:16:48] your car is much cheaper.
[1:16:55] We get there. Maybe not in as much
[1:16:57] style, but we get there.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Understand that you may not have the
[1:17:03] biggest and the best and the fastest,
[1:17:05] but you will get there.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The father's house in
[1:17:12] Greek
[1:17:15] it means in his domain in his tabernacle
[1:17:19] his place of abode his residence.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; It also means in my father's kingdom
[1:17:28] mansion means a place of relationship
[1:17:31] not just a location
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; means a state of position.
[1:17:40] or a condition
[1:17:42] or another dimension.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't that good?
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; May all of us here this morning at some
[1:17:52] time during the ministry of this sermon,
[1:17:57] may you be jettisoned
[1:18:00] into heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. to where all of a sudden you be
[1:18:07] quickened so much by the word of God
[1:18:10] that you leave your chair not physically
[1:18:12] but spiritually. Wow,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; that was good. And
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; let me tell you that good that you feel
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; when you are quickened like that is one
[1:18:24] day going to become so good and goodter
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; and the goodest
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; until you was not
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; until you are taken and caught away
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; caught up.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; I tell you since 1971
[1:18:48] I've been caught up.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; This world is not your final
[1:19:05] destination.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; The grave is not our final resting
[1:19:13] place.
[1:19:17] This is only a shadow of something far
[1:19:19] greater.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand that Jesus
[1:19:24] said, "Be ye perfect as your father in
[1:19:29] heaven is perfect." Now, I don't know
[1:19:30] about you, but that makes me nervous.
[1:19:34] Because there's been times that I've
[1:19:35] thought, "How can I be perfect?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; How can I say and do and act?" Because
[1:19:42] just about the time you think, "Okay,
[1:19:43] I'm going to be perfect." You get out of
[1:19:45] bed and you stub your toe or
[1:19:52] the meal's not cooked the way it
[1:19:55] you like it,
[1:19:57] whatever, and all of a sudden you lose
[1:19:59] it,
[1:20:01] right?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; You know what they used to do when you
[1:20:06] went hunting with brother Brennham?
[1:20:09] They had a camp cook. And the rule was
[1:20:13] that the first one to complain of the
[1:20:15] cooking became the cook.
[1:20:20] A lot of you'd be doing your own
[1:20:22] cooking.
[1:20:24] Yeah. One time the brother he he got the
[1:20:27] biscuits were quite hard.
[1:20:31] And the brother he he said, "Man, this
[1:20:34] biscuit is as hard as a hockey puck."
[1:20:37] And as as soon as he said it, he
[1:20:40] realized they can't rule and he said,
[1:20:42] "But that's just how I like it.
[1:20:52] God cannot send you somewhere that you
[1:20:54] cannot go."
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; God will not ask of you to do something
[1:20:59] that you cannot do.
[1:21:01] Hallelujah.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; It would be unfair for a god to tell you
[1:21:07] to be perfect
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; and he couldn't make a way of perfection
[1:21:11] for you.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about this physical
[1:21:14] perfection because this body, no matter
[1:21:17] how much you put of the Holy Ghost on
[1:21:19] it, is still got its imperfections.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why in a moment in the
[1:21:25] twinkling of an eye, I'll take off this
[1:21:27] imperfection and put on God's
[1:21:29] perfection. I'll put on a theophony body
[1:21:32] that's been speaking to me, that's been
[1:21:34] calling to me.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Come up hither.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's that part of you.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Understand that part of you that never
[1:21:44] felt
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Been calling to you. What is it? It is
[1:21:50] that eternal part of you.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said, "If you're an
[1:21:54] eternal being, you always were eternal."
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; You came down to this earth. You didn't
[1:21:59] know anything about it. Had spiritual
[1:22:01] amnesia. But when you heard the word,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; when you heard the word, we're not
[1:22:06] talking about somebody quoting
[1:22:08] scripture.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; We're talking about God opening your
[1:22:12] understanding that you might catch what
[1:22:14] the word is saying.
[1:22:17] The
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; logos
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; is the thought of God in the beginning.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; God
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; created the heaven and the earth.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said what that God was was
[1:22:34] the logos.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Logos means the thought.
[1:22:42] So, brother Brennham said, "I want to go
[1:22:45] beyond the beginning."
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Because he says in your Bible, it says,
[1:22:50] "In the beginning, God."
[1:22:54] Now, watch this, Johnny. You know what
[1:22:55] this prophet said?
[1:22:57] Come take a journey with me.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Come journey with me beyond the curtain
[1:23:04] of time.
[1:23:06] Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Let me take you back into the very
[1:23:08] eternal mind of God.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Where before he was God, he was dwelling
[1:23:15] alone
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; with his thoughts.
[1:23:20] But he would not want to live the rest
[1:23:23] of
[1:23:25] his life or his eternal being, his
[1:23:29] essence
[1:23:30] without fellowship.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; He created angels. They worshiped,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; but that's not the fellowship he was
[1:23:39] looking for.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; He wanted somebody
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; like him.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; So he says in the beginning God created
[1:23:51] the logos.
[1:23:53] So brother Brennham takes you back. He
[1:23:55] said if you ever
[1:23:58] was a part of God you always have to.
[1:24:00] Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Now, all of a sudden, it takes away all
[1:24:04] of this stuff of what you do and uh how
[1:24:07] you react and all of this stuff and I'm
[1:24:10] going to do this and I'm going to do
[1:24:12] that. And it takes away all
[1:24:14] of your good works
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; and realize
[1:24:20] that it's by faith are we saved through
[1:24:23] grace.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; And that faith that I have is a gift of
[1:24:27] God. It's not something that I attain
[1:24:30] to. God gave me faith.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; I thank you, God.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; The reason I believe in him, the reason
[1:24:38] I believe his word is because he gave me
[1:24:40] the faith to believe it.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Watch this. In non seed.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; There is nothing to quicken.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:56] Jesus speaking of his second coming
[1:25:01] he says I go away to prepare a place.
[1:25:07] So there is a people he said I send my
[1:25:10] messenger
[1:25:12] to prepare the way. So the messenger is
[1:25:16] actually God's provided way
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; so that you can get to the place Amen.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Because a prophet is a seer.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; So a prophet now in every age is a
[1:25:35] messenger. Behold, I send my messenger
[1:25:39] to go before me
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; to prepare
[1:25:44] a place.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; And to show you the way.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Listen. Thank God for this message.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the messenger. We do
[1:25:58] appreciate the messenger that God sent,
[1:26:00] but we don't worship the messenger.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; But we worship him who sent the
[1:26:06] messenger.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a day it will be when we see
[1:26:11] our prophet and we hug his neck and
[1:26:14] everything. But listen, there's one even
[1:26:15] greater that I want to see than him.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? That's Jesus
[1:26:21] Christ.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; God's a way maker.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Now understand that only
[1:26:34] and I I'm going to clarify something
[1:26:36] here and listen carefully. Measure these
[1:26:39] words
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; that only the Holy Ghostfilled bride
[1:26:45] will fully understand
[1:26:48] what this prophet messenger is saying.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Foolish virgin are quickened
[1:26:56] or awakened to the fact that there's a
[1:26:59] message.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Five wise,
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; five foolish. Amen.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And it came about the midnight hour a
[1:27:10] shout.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; And that shout was an exclamation.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; It was declaring something. Behold, the
[1:27:18] bridegroom cometh.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Go ye out to meet him.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; So this message is a message of
[1:27:25] preparation.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Get ready.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; He's coming.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Let me say this to all of you. Get
[1:27:33] ready. He's coming.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:41] So
[1:27:43] all of them, both wise and foolish, were
[1:27:45] aroused,
[1:27:47] were awakened. Don't rejoice in the
[1:27:49] fact, well, God sent a prophet. Praise
[1:27:52] God. Message.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; But that just starts,
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; We got to get into the message.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] It's not mentally acknowledging God sent
[1:28:05] a prophet,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; but what did that prophet say?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Let's get into that message.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Revelation.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Is more important to you than you
[1:28:16] realize.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; So therefore, when you ask God, God,
[1:28:19] give me revelation.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Ask abundantly.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; God, give me revelation that will blow
[1:28:27] my mind, that will quicken me. Pardon
[1:28:30] that old that old expression, but
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; let me get so inspired
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; that I think it not robbery
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; to be equal
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; with God.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; That's a position.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; That's a placing. Yeah. Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said in the feast of
[1:28:58] trumpets
[1:28:59] 64 and the seventh angel's message under
[1:29:03] the same trumpet,
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; same everything. Exactly the same seal
[1:29:08] and that seventh seal is our seal.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Why? That's the coming of the Lord.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Is to what? call the people,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; the bride
[1:29:23] out of the Pentecostal and worldly
[1:29:25] tradition.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; To the genuine atonement, the word.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Christ impersonated in his word here
[1:29:36] made flesh
[1:29:38] among us. See, science proved it by
[1:29:40] pictures. The church knows it. The world
[1:29:42] around, we firmly know it. He's never
[1:29:45] told us one thing. In thus sayaith the
[1:29:48] Lord, but what's been the truth?
[1:29:51] He did. Did he not say down there on the
[1:29:54] river as John the Baptist was sent?
[1:29:58] So will this message.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Brother R said, I looked up and it was
[1:30:05] 12:00.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Midnight hour is here friends
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; upon us. See how perfect the scripture
[1:30:12] is.
[1:30:14] Now I want all of you to understand
[1:30:19] that you have been quickened by the
[1:30:22] shout of this end time.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; That's the message
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; that was spoken by Malachi 4.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; The messenger recognizing your day and
[1:30:36] its message.
[1:30:38] So the shout caused an awakening, a
[1:30:42] quickening.
[1:30:45] You've been caught up.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And you'll be caught up
[1:30:49] together with them."
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; That word caught up actually is the
[1:30:55] Greek word harpado means to intercept,
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; to take it by force.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:06] There's nothing more exciting in a game
[1:31:08] than when the the other team is they're
[1:31:12] making their way play after play towards
[1:31:14] the goal line and all of a sudden
[1:31:17] they're throwing a pass and one of the
[1:31:19] guys intercepts it.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; They wasn't expecting it. He grabs that
[1:31:24] pass and all of a sudden touchdown.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; I want you all of you to understand the
[1:31:31] enemy. I listened to spoken word as the
[1:31:34] original seed last night and again this
[1:31:36] morning and he says now Satan is
[1:31:39] deceiving all of the people in this age
[1:31:42] denominationals put them all under the
[1:31:44] same blanket. He said the world is
[1:31:46] religious.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Huh? He don't Hey, listen. He don't care
[1:31:52] if you're religious. He'll let you be
[1:31:54] religious.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; You can have Christ in a manger. He is
[1:31:58] no longer in a manger.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bring Christ out of history. Bring
[1:32:03] him down into a tabernacle thou has
[1:32:05] prepared for me.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; But he said it's a relationship.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; We are part of a woke generation. We're
[1:32:21] seeing it all around us. Woke this and
[1:32:23] woke that. That's just the imitation of
[1:32:26] something that's in the real.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Because when this message
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:30] comes to your understanding and you
[1:32:33] begin to become enlightened.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; It actually to you is your position.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; It's causing you to be caught up to to
[1:32:42] actually become intercepted.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; He catches you by force. Let me tell
[1:32:47] you, since I came across this message,
[1:32:50] or may I say it came to me.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; I didn't find it. It found me.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I didn't go find Christ. I wasn't
[1:33:00] looking for him.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; He came looking for me.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] [Applause]
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; God was looking for you.
[1:33:22] Yes, sir.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; He told Paul, the Apostle Paul, one
[1:33:24] time, he says, "Go into this city and
[1:33:27] preach.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; For I have much seed in this city."
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; How do you know if there's seed or not?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Just preach his word.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "If there elected," Brother Ram
[1:33:41] said, I go and wherever I minister, he
[1:33:43] said, now to denominations, I have to be
[1:33:46] real careful because I I use a word that
[1:33:48] might offend somebody. I talk about
[1:33:50] predestinated. So he says, "So I don't
[1:33:52] use predestinated. I use for ordained,
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; but he said if they're elected, I say
[1:33:59] just enough that they catch it."
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I got it."
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got it.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:15] Just like, you know, we got a little
[1:34:17] softball team and these guys, they play
[1:34:20] together and everything. And we got an
[1:34:21] outfield. Listen, they just hit it out
[1:34:23] there. And these young guys, they run,
[1:34:26] they run like a gazelle
[1:34:29] and they love to make these spectacular
[1:34:31] catches and they slide.
[1:34:34] Got it. I said,
[1:34:37] they just somebody hit it out there and
[1:34:40] somebody's going to catch it.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what I'm doing, I'm doing three
[1:34:44] flies up first pull.
[1:34:47] Got it.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; But you're just each one of you when the
[1:34:51] word goes forth.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand God's got a
[1:34:54] word for you this morning. You, every
[1:34:56] one of you, I don't care how old you
[1:34:58] are. I don't care how seasoned you are.
[1:35:01] I don't care how immature for you. God
[1:35:03] has got a word for you this morning. And
[1:35:06] you say, "I got it."
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; You'll catch it
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; if you'll be aware of it.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Now, understand this. It was not the
[1:35:19] voice
[1:35:20] of William Brham that got you.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Though God used his vocal cords,
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; though God used him as the vessel,
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; but the vessel, the trumpet,
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; except it gives a certain sound. That's
[1:35:40] right.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; You don't know what to do.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; So, thank God that God took the vessel
[1:35:45] and the trumpet in this hour and he blew
[1:35:49] it.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; But you have to have an ear to hear what
[1:35:55] the spirit is saying.
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Why is it you don't
[1:36:03] understand my words?"
[1:36:08] He says, "You don't understand my
[1:36:11] speech."
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Do you understand,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; brother Warren? This message is coded.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; It's encrypted.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And I don't understand all of this
[1:36:44] stuff. And I could get guys like Warren
[1:36:46] and stuff that knows all this
[1:36:47] encryptions and secret things and and
[1:36:49] and firewalls and all this kind of
[1:36:52] stuff. But let me tell you, this message
[1:36:54] is encrypted.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; It is. And though you listen to a tape,
[1:37:00] and though you hear that prophet
[1:37:02] speaking, there's got to come a time
[1:37:04] when all of a sudden the door opens and
[1:37:07] the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit
[1:37:09] comes down, makes you aware, and then
[1:37:12] you go, "Aha!"
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; The woman at the well heard Jesus
[1:37:22] speaking
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; and he was talking to her, "Go get your
[1:37:27] husband. and I don't have one. Yeah,
[1:37:28] you've said well you've had five and a
[1:37:31] husband you got with now is not yours.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Why seven is the number of completion
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; She says watch this John 4 I just show
[1:37:49] you in the scripture John 4 verse 19
[1:37:51] through 26. And a woman saith unto him,
[1:37:54] "Sir,"
[1:37:56] now remember, he's been talking to her.
[1:37:57] I had a dialogue,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; going back and forth. She's got
[1:38:01] religious understanding,
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; but he keeps going. She keeps going to
[1:38:06] church. She's at the well. God does
[1:38:08] things at wells.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Women are found at wells.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And here was the woman at the well.
[1:38:18] Answer,
[1:38:20] I perceive
[1:38:22] thou art a prophet. Wow. All of a
[1:38:26] sudden, the enlightenment Jesus saying
[1:38:28] she's getting it.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Our fathers worshiped in this mountain.
[1:38:34] And we and ye say that in Jerusalem is
[1:38:36] the place where men ought to worship.
[1:38:39] So, it looks a little bit hard for her
[1:38:41] to understand. Jesus saith unto her,
[1:38:44] woman, believe me. The hour cometh when
[1:38:47] ye shall neither in this mountain nor
[1:38:49] yet at Jerusalem. Worship the father.
[1:38:53] You worship ye know not what.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; We know what we worship for salvation is
[1:39:01] of the Jews.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; But the hour cometh and now is. Somebody
[1:39:05] say now is.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Say it again. Now is.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; The hour cometh and now is.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] When the true worshippers
[1:39:15] shall worship the father
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; in spirit
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; and
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; in truth. Why? Because the truth will
[1:39:24] set you free.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people worshiping in
[1:39:28] spirit.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; They're anointed by the spirit but have
[1:39:31] no truth.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; For the father seeketh such to worship
[1:39:36] him. God is a spirit,
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; and they that worship him must worship
[1:39:42] him in spirit and in truth. And a woman
[1:39:45] saith in him, I know, now watch, she's
[1:39:47] getting more religious now. I know that
[1:39:49] the Messiah cometh,
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; which is called Christ.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; When he has come, he will tell us all
[1:39:56] things.
[1:39:58] Jesus saith unto her
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; I that speak unto thee
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; am he.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; I'm the one.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:40:20] And no man comes to the father but by
[1:40:22] me.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; You're saying when the Messiah comes,
[1:40:25] he'll show you all things. woman.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Tada.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; I see Jesus in him only.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; I don't see three gods.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; I see God as one.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Both the wise and the foolish virgin
[1:40:50] were awakened by the shout.
[1:40:53] The time had come for final preparation
[1:40:56] because it's lamp trimming time.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; But the foolish failed to make a
[1:41:02] preparation before the shout.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Oil.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Oil a type of the Holy Spirit.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; With all of your getting, get the Holy
[1:41:15] Spirit.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:41:19] you came to the message? That's good.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:41:24] I was baptized.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; By the messenger,
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; I see the message.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody say a little bit more. Come on.
[1:41:38] Come on. Come on.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Like the little mama teaching it. Yeah.
[1:41:41] Good. Good. Come on.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. One more. Come on.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:52] So this final preparation, it's lamp
[1:41:55] trimming time.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; It's a time to find out because now
[1:41:59] listen why
[1:42:03] it's evening time. It's about midnight.
[1:42:06] Most people are sleeping.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; And there was a shout about the midnight
[1:42:11] hour
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; because there's no light. Sun's gone
[1:42:15] down. Come on.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus did not fault them
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; that they their light was not shining.
[1:42:22] He said, "Now trim your lamp."
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; But at the very time, the shout that
[1:42:28] awoke them, they realized at that time,
[1:42:31] I need to go out and meet you.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; And they lit their lamp. And if any of
[1:42:38] you that have ever used oil lamps,
[1:42:41] probably some of you have never done it.
[1:42:45] But you take a lamp that has the bowl,
[1:42:48] it has the wick, it has the globe, it
[1:42:52] has the adjuster that this and you light
[1:42:55] it. If there's never been oil on the
[1:42:57] wick, you light the wick and it lights
[1:43:00] for just a second
[1:43:02] and very suddenly goes out.
[1:43:05] So you understand that unless you have
[1:43:08] the oil, you're not going to burn for
[1:43:10] him.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Your light cannot shine.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; So at the very hour when he says, "Get
[1:43:19] ready."
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Go ye out to meet him. And he went and
[1:43:24] trimmed their lamps. And that's when the
[1:43:26] foolish virgin realized, "I haven't got
[1:43:28] it."
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Now listen, I want to say this as a
[1:43:31] pastor.
[1:43:33] I'm not saying it's over.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; But we're close.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; I'm saying if you don't have the Holy
[1:43:39] Spirit, you make sure you get it. Why?
[1:43:42] It's a promise.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And God keeps his promises. And he said,
[1:43:46] "I'll give you the promise of the Holy
[1:43:48] Ghost."
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; It's a gift.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Now, a gift has got to be received. If I
[1:43:56] say, "Carver, man, I got a gift for you,
[1:43:58] buddy. I got a gift." Man, you're going
[1:44:00] to love it. I'll tell you what, I have
[1:44:02] worked so hard. I'm going to give you a
[1:44:04] gift. And no matter how much I talk
[1:44:06] about it, it ain't yours until you
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; receive it.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, and he breathed
[1:44:18] on him,
[1:44:20] receive he
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit. They didn't get it
[1:44:23] right then.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; He's just saying, when it comes,
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; receive it. Amen.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; You got to receive the Holy Spirit for
[1:44:32] it is a
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; it is a gift of God. It is a promise and
[1:44:36] God does not give a gift and then take
[1:44:39] it back.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; So if you haven't received it, I ask you
[1:44:42] why have you not? Well, I was baptized
[1:44:44] unto John, but John said my baptism
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; is unto repentance.
[1:44:51] But the one I'm preaching about,
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; the one who I am a messenger to prepare,
[1:44:57] I tell you there's one greater than me
[1:45:00] coming after me. And his baptism is far
[1:45:03] greater.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; For he shall baptize you with the Holy
[1:45:06] Ghost.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; And fire.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Fire."
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Fire.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Fire.
[1:45:17] the Holy Ghost and
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; fire. There's no better cleansing
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; for anything in this world. If you go to
[1:45:26] the hospital and they use their alcohol
[1:45:28] and all that stuff, that's good. You go
[1:45:30] to the dentist and they clean your
[1:45:32] teeth, man. I pray that they use the
[1:45:36] enclave to clean those tools before they
[1:45:38] put it in your mouth.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be terrible?
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Yuck. I can't even think.
[1:45:49] No greater
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; cleansing
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; than fire.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:45:59] boy.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; The lamp is only used in evening time
[1:46:05] when the sun's gone down. So now trim
[1:46:07] your lamps. And so they trim their lamps
[1:46:10] and they go out to meet him. Now
[1:46:13] the son of man, you say, "Well, they
[1:46:16] They didn't expect him at midnight.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Because the son of man cometh
[1:46:24] when you least expect.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:46:29] Well, had I known, I'd have been ready.
[1:46:32] But man, it's not fair. You come when
[1:46:36] I'm sleeping.
[1:46:40] Brother Brandham said in the sermon, the
[1:46:42] rapture, and understand that the rapture
[1:46:44] is not a single event.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord is not just the
[1:46:49] catching away.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; The rapture is not just being
[1:46:54] translated.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; There's a transformation taking place
[1:46:59] right now.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; You're being changed from one glory to
[1:47:03] another glory.
[1:47:05] And little by little, that's how that
[1:47:07] they took the promised land was little
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; by little. They couldn't take it all at
[1:47:12] once. Why?
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Didn't have the the means.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And yet God said, "Go. I've given you
[1:47:20] the land,
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; but you're going to have to fight for
[1:47:22] it."
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; So, in the sermon, the rapture, now
[1:47:26] watch this. The first thing comes when
[1:47:28] he starts descending from heaven.
[1:47:32] There's a shout. So, can we say he we've
[1:47:37] seen his descending?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Huh? You recognize the shout? Can you
[1:47:42] then Hey, he's descending.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; So, the rapture is already happening.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Can you understand that it's happening?
[1:47:51] Hey,
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; he's coming.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; He's descending.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; We've heard the shout. What is it? It's
[1:47:58] a message
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; to get the people together. That's why
[1:48:02] you're here this morning.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Not because it's my ministry.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Not because it's a good location,
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; not because this is a convenient church,
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; but because God sent a message,
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; to get the people together. A message
[1:48:23] come forth. First lamp turning time.
[1:48:26] Rise and trim your lamps. What watch was
[1:48:28] that? The seventh. Not the sixth. The
[1:48:30] seven behold the bridegroom cometh, rise
[1:48:33] and trim your lamps. And they did. Some
[1:48:35] of them found they didn't even have any
[1:48:37] oil in their lamp. It's lamp trimming
[1:48:39] time. Malachi 4 time.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; It's Luke 17.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; It's all the prophecy that can be
[1:48:46] perfectly set in order for this day. And
[1:48:48] in the scripture, we're seeing it living
[1:48:51] right there.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Never before in the history of mankind
[1:48:55] has been man
[1:48:57] more desirous of more oil.
[1:49:03] the most precious commodity
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; oil. He that controls the oil
[1:49:10] controls
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; the economy
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; because everything that we touch and
[1:49:18] everything around us and all of our
[1:49:20] facets of life
[1:49:23] have to do with petroleum products.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; The clothes you wear, the car you drive,
[1:49:30] the food that you eat.
[1:49:33] Not it's a petroleum product. I caught
[1:49:35] that. No, but you use fuel to light the
[1:49:40] fire
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; to keep it going. You see, to to heat it
[1:49:45] up
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; or you might nuke it.
[1:49:50] I've This is just me. I've always
[1:49:52] wondered
[1:49:54] how in the world you put this thing in
[1:49:56] there, press it,
[1:50:00] A few minutes later, this thing's
[1:50:01] steaming hot.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Is it good for you? I don't know. I know
[1:50:07] this. I don't want my food nuclear. I
[1:50:10] want mine warmed up.
[1:50:13] I want fire to touch that thing. Okay.
[1:50:17] Anyway,
[1:50:20] now all of you going to get rid of your
[1:50:25] every pass.
[1:50:28] Who said, "Oh, no." Yeah. Okay, Steve.
[1:50:31] All right.
[1:50:34] You get a free pass on that one.
[1:50:37] Every facet of your way of life has to
[1:50:41] do with oil. That's why it's such a
[1:50:43] important commodity
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; because it affects the way you walk, the
[1:50:48] manner of speech and the way you live.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand that this
[1:50:55] oil of the Holy Spirit will affect every
[1:50:59] facet of your life. The way you walk,
[1:51:01] the way you talk,
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; your manner of speech,
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; your position
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; has to do with oil.
[1:51:13] Jerusalem is now the hot spot
[1:51:17] of the world.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; It is a hot potato. Oh my. Jerusalem.
[1:51:24] Why Jerusalem? Not why not Mecca? Why
[1:51:27] not New York City?
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:51:31] Why not these other places around the
[1:51:33] world? There's only one place and a
[1:51:35] world is
[1:51:39] consumed with Jerusalem.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Because Jerusalem is not just a
[1:51:45] location.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; It's a bride.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; It's a people.
[1:51:54] It is not only a prepared place but a
[1:51:57] prepared people
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; because those that are in the bride are
[1:52:01] going to live
[1:52:03] in the new
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[1:52:18] We are marching over to Jerusalem.
[1:52:24] Yes, sir.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; I'm on my way.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; And the new Jerusalem.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; That's the reason it's such a hot spot,
[1:52:32] a hot potato. And the Bible says, "And
[1:52:34] be beware of how you handle Jerusalem,
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; because
[1:52:42] we're seeing an anti-semitic spirit come
[1:52:45] up in the world today.
[1:52:52] And we're seeing this come up against
[1:52:55] them because they're Jews.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; And now we're seeing that those who
[1:53:01] support Jerusalem are being attacked.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Why do you think 911 happened?
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Why the Twin Towers,
[1:53:17] the World Trade Center?
[1:53:20] Why? Because of Wall Street Jews.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Control the economy.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; You want to shake somebody up, hit their
[1:53:30] pocketbook.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; So they attacked the United States
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; because we were supporting Israel.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Because whosoever blesses Israel shall
[1:53:43] be blessed.
[1:53:46] We're seeing it more and more in your
[1:53:48] newspapers
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; in almost every day enough anti-semitism
[1:53:54] coming up the college campuses. Why
[1:53:56] college campuses? Because they're of the
[1:53:59] tree of knowledge.
[1:54:01] Amen.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; And these young kids without a baptism
[1:54:04] of the Holy Ghost,
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; their influence,
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; through their carnal reason,
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; through the knowledge of man. God is not
[1:54:16] known by knowledge.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; God is known by revelation.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; So you go to these places of higher
[1:54:26] education of the tree of knowledge. Let
[1:54:29] me tell you, you young people, you go to
[1:54:31] get a career, if you don't are not
[1:54:33] balanced with the Holy Spirit,
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; that place of higher education will eat
[1:54:39] you up and spit you out.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; I've seen it happen. Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; I've seen some of the finest young
[1:54:46] people I know go off and go to school,
[1:54:48] go to college, next thing you know,
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; they leave the message, leave Christ,
[1:54:52] and they're off
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; because the God of this evil age hath
[1:54:57] blinded
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; their minds, lest the light of the
[1:55:01] glorious gospel should shine on them
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; places of higher education. So now all
[1:55:06] these colleges and people that are
[1:55:09] supposed to be so smart
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; professors
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; and teachers of our children
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; when most of them don't even know if
[1:55:17] they're a man or a woman.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; The messenger is sent to prepare the
[1:55:31] way.
[1:55:33] The word way
[1:55:36] in Hebrew means
[1:55:39] a course of life or a manner of action
[1:55:41] or a manner of life. I go to prepare
[1:55:46] the way, a manner of life.
[1:55:49] So the messenger is not to just
[1:55:54] preach about a message, but he's to
[1:55:56] prepare a way,
[1:55:59] a manner of life, an action to get you
[1:56:02] into action.
[1:56:07] And let me say this that John the
[1:56:09] Baptist said, "I am the voice
[1:56:13] crying in the wilderness to prepare the
[1:56:16] way."
[1:56:20] And everyone that his ministry touched
[1:56:26] as they received the messenger, it
[1:56:29] affected their manner
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; of life, what they live, their manner of
[1:56:34] speech.
[1:56:38] This message
[1:56:41] if it has not changed your life
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; or it's not in the process of changing
[1:56:49] you.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Either you're not seed
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; or you haven't grown up enough to quit
[1:57:01] your childish ways.
[1:57:04] Because when I was a child,
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; I thought, I spoke,
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; I understood as a child, but when I
[1:57:12] became a man, I put away childish.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; so to prepare a way means to change the
[1:57:23] manner of life.
[1:57:27] If this message or this messenger has
[1:57:30] not changed your life,
[1:57:35] I doubt your seed.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Chew on that for a while.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Because though you've been raised in a
[1:57:43] message, church doesn't make you seed.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Though you've been raised with
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; seed parents,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Isaac and Rebecca
[1:57:57] brought forth also in Esau.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; So as much as we say all of our children
[1:58:09] are seed,
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; it will be their reaction
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; to that messenger's message
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; that proves whether or not they are
[1:58:20] seed.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:58:26] It's It's true. I I Look, I'm not here
[1:58:30] to baby you. I'm not here to
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to talk you into it,
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; to persuade you. No. Listen, if you're
[1:58:38] if you're Lex Seed, you'll see it.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Huh? I don't have to sit here and scream
[1:58:43] and yell it at you. If you're in Lexi
[1:58:47] and
[1:58:51] you're going to jump, you're going to
[1:58:52] shout because there's a lot of times I'm
[1:58:54] not jumping and I'm not shouting,
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; but I'm still seed.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; I like to jump and shout.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; But man, give me something to jump and
[1:59:05] shout about.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:14] Now
[1:59:33] in school in botany
[1:59:36] or biology, any of you that were in
[1:59:38] school, you understand there is a
[1:59:42] process whereby things that have the
[1:59:45] ability to take light and process it
[1:59:50] into life. That process is called
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; photosynthesis. How do you spell it?
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. How you spell
[2:00:02] photoynthesis?
[2:00:04] In other words,
[2:00:07] these plants catch the sunlight.
[2:00:11] They come
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden the light
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; grow.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; I'm following the sun.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; You sisters put a plant in the window.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; The rising of the sun. You see the plant
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; this way. What? Do you turn the pot? No.
[2:00:39] The plant.
[2:00:42] The plant tracks the sun.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; What are you doing?
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on. Amen.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; I'm tracking the sun.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Because God's constant. He keeps moving.
[2:00:54] And wherever he moves, I'm attracted to
[2:00:56] it. What is this attraction? I tell you,
[2:00:59] it's called photosynthesis.
[2:01:01] I'm taking the light. Hallelujah. And
[2:01:03] I'm catching it. And I'm turning it into
[2:01:05] light. And I'm growing and I'm pushing
[2:01:08] out.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:11] Hallelujah.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; It's changing me from glory to glory
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; until one day I'll be totally changed in
[2:01:18] a moment.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Only those
[2:01:27] ordained to eternal life will catch it.
[2:01:29] They're the only ones that have the
[2:01:31] ability.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; A rock feels the same sunlight.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; No life change.
[2:01:40] A brick feels the same sunlight.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; No change.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; A piece of steel
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; gets warm by the same sunlight. Like
[2:01:50] people go to church. Oh, I feel this
[2:01:52] warm fuzzy feel.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; But there's no change. That's why people
[2:01:57] can go
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; be under the anointing of God.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; They feel the effect.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; But look at the congregation. There's no
[2:02:07] change. Yeah.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; The thing about this message, look at
[2:02:11] the lives of the people
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; who were off in denomination
[2:02:16] under the darkness of religion and they
[2:02:20] see the light in the end time and their
[2:02:22] eyes come open and their lives are
[2:02:25] changed.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell them what to do.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; They catch it.
[2:02:38] Just preach the word.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Acts 13 verse 46.
[2:02:47] Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and
[2:02:50] said, "It was necessary that the word of
[2:02:52] God should have first been spoken to
[2:02:54] you, but seeing you put it away, you put
[2:02:58] it from you and judge yourselves
[2:03:00] unworthy of everlasting life. Lo, we
[2:03:02] turn to the Gentiles."
[2:03:05] So hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I
[2:03:08] have set thee to be a light
[2:03:12] to the Gentiles,
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; that thou shouldest be for salvation
[2:03:17] unto the ends of the earth.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; And when the Gentiles heard this, they
[2:03:23] were glad and glorified the word of the
[2:03:25] Lord. And as many as were ordained to
[2:03:30] eternal life,
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Why are you believing? What do you
[2:03:38] believe? Because you were ordained to
[2:03:40] eternal life.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; I can't help it.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; I just know it.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; I read a little thing that had these
[2:03:54] children, the teachers asking questions
[2:03:57] for the students, and some of the kids
[2:03:58] come up with some profound answers.
[2:04:02] And one of the questions was, "How did
[2:04:04] you circle the answer and make the right
[2:04:08] decision?"
[2:04:10] And the little kid just said, "I just
[2:04:11] know."
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, how how did you make
[2:04:18] this decision?
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; I just know.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Nobody talked me into it.
[2:04:33] I just know
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; I love it says and I know this that when
[2:04:39] he comes
[2:04:42] we
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; shall be like him.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; And then we shall know even
[2:04:51] as I am known. Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; You talk about
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; an upgrade
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; in your understanding.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; It's so far beyond
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; anything. And just about the time that I
[2:05:08] think I'm fully re revelated and I'm
[2:05:12] pretty well catching it, God opens
[2:05:14] another door.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; And I realize
[2:05:23] that the more I know,
[2:05:25] the less I know.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; How do I know that? I just know.
[2:05:32] And he said, "God is so great, it will
[2:05:36] take an eternity
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; to reveal himself."
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; It just starts here.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; And he that begun a good work in you
[2:05:47] will finish it.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; God has no grandchildren.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; He has only sons and daughters.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Grandparents spoil their children.
[2:06:01] their grandchildren. Grandchildren, not
[2:06:02] their their children. They worked on
[2:06:04] them, man. Huh? Yeah. My grandkids get
[2:06:08] away with stuff that my kids said, "You
[2:06:10] never would have let me get."
[2:06:13] Well, that's cuz
[2:06:15] I've learned a little bit now.
[2:06:19] I'm a better father now as a grandfather
[2:06:21] than I was when I was a father. You're
[2:06:24] going to do
[2:06:30] Yeah. And usually when we get all
[2:06:33] excited and we get angry and we want to
[2:06:36] correct our kids,
[2:06:38] a lot of times we don't have the right
[2:06:41] attitude, do we?
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:06:47] The Bible says, "Be be careful,
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; oh father, how that thou correct thy son
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; because the way you correct him,
[2:06:57] God will correct you."
[2:07:00] How much of the time? Like that one
[2:07:02] preacher, I don't say this to be a joke
[2:07:04] or sacrilegious.
[2:07:06] That pastor one time got so vexed with
[2:07:08] his people. You hardheaded people. I
[2:07:11] tell you what, I'm sick and tired of the
[2:07:14] hypocrisy. I'm tired of the people. And
[2:07:16] he just got he says, "God, I want you to
[2:07:20] smite every one of them."
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; And just soon as he said it, his heart
[2:07:24] began to fail.
[2:07:26] He grabbed his chest. They said, "Oh
[2:07:28] God, save every one of them."
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; How dare we look our nose
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; down our nose at others? I'm glad I'm
[2:07:38] not like that guy.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; I'm glad somebody didn't judge the book
[2:07:43] by its cover when they saw me.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Long-haired hippie.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. In fact, Brother Brennham.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Huh? These Rickies, these Rickettas,
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; I tell you this Ricky, Ricky, Ricky,
[2:07:59] Ricky. Till God said, "Hey, stop it."
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Some of those Rickys are mine.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; One of them.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Ricky, are you here?
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; I was one of them. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Wasn't my name. It was my nature.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; But not my seed.
[2:08:22] Because we were even as others
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; who were by nature
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; children of disobedience. And I thank
[2:08:30] God he didn't say we were by seed
[2:08:32] children. No. Because if you're children
[2:08:34] of seed,
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; you will be children
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; of obedience.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Not that you don't make mistakes.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; If God doesn't correct you,
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; he doesn't love you. That's right.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Because as many as I love,
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; I rebuke and I
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; give them all of the that they want.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; I make them spoiled rotten brats.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Every prayer they pray for and
[2:09:08] everything, oh God, give me this. Oh
[2:09:12] God, give me that. And if God did that
[2:09:13] and gave you everything you ask for,
[2:09:15] well, I ask for it in Jesus name. But
[2:09:17] Jesus also said, "But when you ask, ask
[2:09:20] in faith, believing,
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, why don't you give me a Mercedes?
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; You don't need a Mercedes.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; You're carnal.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with it. If you can drive
[2:09:36] a Mercedes, praise the Lord.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; My son's got one.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; I like to drive it. I like when he
[2:09:45] drives me around in it.
[2:09:51] What I'm saying, hey, it's it's not
[2:09:54] remember men in the scripture that were
[2:09:56] great men were also vastly wealthy.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; It wasn't their wealth that made them
[2:10:01] great.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Do you know some of you will never have
[2:10:06] things of great value in this because
[2:10:08] you know what? You can't handle it.
[2:10:10] That's right.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; It's why you're going to stay a popper
[2:10:12] the rest of your life
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; because God can't give you
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; something of great value because you
[2:10:19] know what? You will put too much
[2:10:20] emphasis on it.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; And you use an excuse.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Well, I I I I I have to build a bigger
[2:10:30] barn.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; I have married a wife. A lot of people
[2:10:34] get married and you know what? They use
[2:10:36] their wife as an excuse why they're not
[2:10:38] in church.
[2:10:40] Okay.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Um, I've got a cow. I've got I bought a
[2:10:45] piece of land. I've got to go prove it.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; All this. What's your excuse?
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; God help us
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; to be one of those faithful. Huh?
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Not using every excuse
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; why not to go to church. I want to find
[2:11:03] every excuse why to go.
[2:11:14] Okay, I'm gonna pass a few things up
[2:11:15] here.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Wait a second.
[2:11:26] Just as it was in the first Exodus.
[2:11:28] Musicians, if you come, I'm going to I'm
[2:11:30] closing. I'm not done yet, but I'm
[2:11:33] closing. Okay. Just letting you guys
[2:11:35] relax here for a second.
[2:11:41] Just as it was in the first Exodus,
[2:11:43] there was a messenger.
[2:11:47] His name was Moses.
[2:11:52] Moses was God's provided way.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Without the prophet, you had no message.
[2:11:59] You had no Exodus.
[2:12:07] And so as it was in the first Exodus
[2:12:09] where there was a messenger which was
[2:12:11] God's provided ways to take a people to
[2:12:14] a prepared place.
[2:12:18] So he was God's provided way to take a
[2:12:21] prepared people to a prepared place.
[2:12:27] Eve
[2:12:29] was a prepared vessel for Adam.
[2:12:32] that Adam might reproduce himself.
[2:12:36] Okay,
[2:12:37] you understand?
[2:12:42] Rebecca
[2:12:45] prepared herself to meet Isaac.
[2:12:49] Ruth
[2:12:51] prepared herself
[2:12:55] to meet Boaz.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Esther
[2:13:02] prepared herself.
[2:13:05] She put on the garments
[2:13:09] that the messenger told her, "Hey, I
[2:13:11] know what the king likes.
[2:13:14] Here's the here's the clothes."
[2:13:18] Esther, Esther, she comes into her
[2:13:21] position.
[2:13:24] She was called,
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; listen,
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; she was called to go into this position.
[2:13:30] So are you.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; You were called to this.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election
[2:13:39] sure.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Esther.
[2:13:43] Well,
[2:13:45] if he didn't send you a summon to bring
[2:13:47] you there, you might die. If I perish,
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; I perish.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; But I shall go before the King. Amen.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; There's no question in my mind, but when
[2:14:02] she walked in,
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; there was a hush,
[2:14:07] maybe a half hour of silence,
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; she's ushering in.
[2:14:21] Who is this?
[2:14:24] It's Queen Esther.
[2:14:26] What is it, my queen?
[2:14:30] What is it that you desire
[2:14:32] up to half
[2:14:34] of my kingdom?
[2:14:41] Esther was called to go before the king.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:14:49] That was her position.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; You have been called to a city, New
[2:14:55] Jerusalem.
[2:14:57] That's the place.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; He's called you
[2:15:03] his wife.
[2:15:07] That's your position.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; But you're going to sit with him on his
[2:15:15] throne
[2:15:17] and you will be queen.
[2:15:21] You understand? That's her pleasing.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:25] Hallelujah.
[2:15:29] My brother, my sister,
[2:15:44] the more that I lay myself before the
[2:15:47] Lord
[2:15:49] and I meditate and I read and I listen,
[2:15:55] the more it's quickened to me.
[2:16:01] And
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; something's happening.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; If I could say this, my ministry is
[2:16:08] changing.
[2:16:10] What is it? Because it's more him.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I show you a great mystery.
[2:16:18] It's no longer I that live, but Christ
[2:16:20] that liveth in me. And the life that I
[2:16:21] now live, I live by the faith of the Son
[2:16:24] of God."
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it's all about. It's
[2:16:28] about him.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:16:31] Oh,
[2:16:38] okay. So, a prepared place
[2:16:41] for a prepared people.
[2:16:45] Now, I want to launch off into my next
[2:16:47] sermon
[2:16:49] and just tell you because
[2:16:52] there's a table
[2:16:55] prepared
[2:16:58] in the face of mine enemies.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Even on your cell phone, of all the
[2:17:06] millions of apps,
[2:17:11] there's one called
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; the table.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; And there God has prepared a feast
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; in the presence
[2:17:26] of mine enemy
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; and Lord
[2:17:32] the Bible says that thou shalt not eat
[2:17:34] of the table of devils and the table of
[2:17:36] God.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; But he has bid us to come to his feast.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:46] So
[2:17:47] then, who is a wise and faithful servant
[2:17:52] who shall give the people spiritual meat
[2:17:56] in due season?
[2:18:00] It's not just tickling your ears and
[2:18:02] preaching some kind of sermon.
[2:18:07] Oh, I got some good quotes. I'm going to
[2:18:09] save them. I'll share them with you the
[2:18:12] next time that we get together.
[2:18:14] Actually, you know, you never actually
[2:18:18] finish your sermon.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; No, it just keeps unfolding.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Keeps just getting better and better.
[2:18:25] And you see this and then you just put
[2:18:27] him in remembrance. That's all we do. We
[2:18:29] just I just let you go home, let you
[2:18:31] relax a little bit, and then uh have you
[2:18:34] come back, then we just continue on and
[2:18:36] everything because it it's a continuing
[2:18:39] story, is it not?
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love him this morning more
[2:18:43] than I've ever loved him.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; I do.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, do I have false failures? Yes,
[2:18:51] I do. It happens every day.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; But I thank God I have a mediator.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; I think I have I I thank God that I have
[2:18:59] a sacrifice that I can go to.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Because a body thou has prepared for me.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; That's what you are. He's called you.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to live inside of you.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; I want to totally consume you."
[2:19:26] When Lucas Rubi years ago and I pro I
[2:19:30] talked about the rapture as a
[2:19:32] revelation,
[2:19:34] you remember the song he sang?
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; I'm rapture positive.
[2:19:39] I said because you know AIDS
[2:19:43] which is autoimmune deficiency and when
[2:19:47] you get AIDS and you have symptoms
[2:19:52] and it's carried
[2:19:55] it's a disease of the blood and when you
[2:19:57] get infected there's a time when you're
[2:20:00] just you know I I'm infected I I've got
[2:20:04] AIDS but when I get fullblown own
[2:20:09] AIDS, then the body is consumed.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Lucas says, "Brother Ron, I'm
[2:20:16] rapture positive.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; I got the symptoms. I've been affected.
[2:20:22] It's by the blood."
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "It's his blood that has
[2:20:27] affected me. It's his messenger that is
[2:20:30] preached. It is the message to prepare a
[2:20:34] place."
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that you might be there
[2:20:37] also. So God is doing this to you. Line
[2:20:42] upon line, precept upon precept, here a
[2:20:45] little, there a little. This Sunday,

[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; God loves to play peekab-boo.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, my wife used to do that
[2:21:05] with our kids and get the little kids in
[2:21:08] front of them and she'd have a little
[2:21:11] thing like this and, you know, peekaboo.
[2:21:14] And Amos would go,
[2:21:17] seconds later, she'd do it again.
