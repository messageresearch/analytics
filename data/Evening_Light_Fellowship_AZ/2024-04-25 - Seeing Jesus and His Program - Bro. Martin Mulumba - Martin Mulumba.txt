Secrets Lord father unto us as we looking away unto you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I Prat you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ it is a privilege once again to be in the house of the Lord amen uh shall we take our Bibles in the book of first king uh chapter 19 verse 13 and it was so when Elijah heard that he was wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what do what Dost thou hear Elijah and he said I have been very jealous of for the Lord God of host because the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thy altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I and I only am left and am left and they seek my life uh my life to take it away and the Lord said unto him go return thy way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest and anoint hael to be king over Syria and jeu the son of Nishi Thou shalt anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of japet of Abola thou shal anoint anoint to be prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escapethe sword of Asel shall J slay and him that escape from The Sword of J shall Elijah slay may God bless you you may be seated uh once again uh uh greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it is uh a privilege to be found in the presence of God looking away unto him uh knowing that uh times are very precious uh we by God's grace we able to uh cramp uh last service most of the things that had to be spoken but by God's grace uh uh you received it very well and giving all the comments by God's grace uh the Lord knows how to lead things and when to take stop and taking turns and stuff because quite often any student of the world knows that when he gets into the water the water gets from the feet to the knees and to the hip and until you start swimming uh it's the never ending yeah it's never ending but by God's grace we believe that each one of us will be able to attend uh to those things as the Lord leads them accordingly uh for tonight I want to uh get started with uh another uh portion of the scripture uh seeing Jesus and his program uh and uh for the subject why Comm humanism we have uh come uh to the word to be able to see Jesus and his program uh as we just sung it there that we are nothing I have nothing uh just like the little baby when um is with the parents he is nothing he can take care of himself he can wipe himself he can get a bath everything every single portion of his life is tied to the father or the mother and uh the this responsible parents have the understanding have the knowledge know exactly the way they should do to lead the child but uh it's not always the case amen when the child start to grow the child start getting all kind of understanding in and knowledge and stuffff then he becomes a he turns into a teenager and he has opinions of about everything uh mom white this Dad me too I think you know the type of the church is the type of uh Christ and uh us uh the pastor can have a leadership over the church but the church can have the opinions Ah that's brother bram's way of looking at things I have my own opinions and things you know but then at the same time now people don't understand the consequences that comes with it amen they can think that you know they have all these ideas that are good to present like you know brother Bram said this but I think myself also this uh but then uh those consequences that uh the world that we are living in the result that we have around us is because people are too much opinionated they have opinions about everything uh then it also happen in the Bible as we are seeing we just read it here in the book of first king 19 uh any student of the word knows that uh every single verse of the Bible unfolds God's program uh we have received the prophet today by God's grace so we have seen the pill of fire that bread that wrote the old and the New Testament uh explain to us what the Bible is in this last days and uh this spill of fire that when it came down it didn't just come to confirm that the prophet was true but to convey a message and that's why we are guarded as we are um Elijah was uh the prophet of a certain time and God used that spirit so uh so that the the The Stance of the spirit that he knew that hea could use this Spirit once again I'll be able to fulfill my program it's not necessarily the spirit of the man Elijah but it was God in the form of the Prophet called Elijah and uh in Sunday time God spoke baram says in the prophet God was in the prophet speaking to the people then it came to pass that you know as God's program was come to pass Elijah had witho Jezebel and his uh program with everything that she had because you know the history of the Bible how Jezebel came into Israel by the marriage of uh a borderline believer and this borderline gave her permission to rise to where she was that he was only the facade of the church he was only the facade of the country that I am the president but it was the lobby behind him that was pulling all the strings that's right and now this system then that God now so that he was not fit to be in the church not to be fit to be in um in the country then God had to send his Prophet around when the prophet came about you know the story he challenged the prophet of bals and and all these things came about and uh the story that you read there in the book of First Kings then he found himself that after all this anointing he went his way God fed him for about few times there and then he said okay go thaty way he went to the cave in the cave he found himself with all this uh Thunders and shaking and Lightnings and all these things here but then after all these things then the voice of the Lord came to him and say what are you doing here Church what are you here why do you come to church you're not in the world you wear long skirts you are called a brother in the message a sister in the message but now we come to the point the Thundering is gone all the shouting is gone when we come to church people don't shout as much as they started at the beginning anymore amen it's not that it's wrong but now they get to a certain point what are you doing here then the Lord comes and says well I'm going to give you another commission you've done what you did yesterday but now there's another portion of the work that is being revealed as time goes as brother bham say light upon light follows you see more it yesterday then you don't have to stop you need to be fed and so that you can be able to move a little bit bit ahead again in the in the journey and it come to pass that him verse 17 uh the Bible says it come to pass when uh uh uh uh Elijah was given the commission it said that and he it come shall pass that him that escape of the sword of of AEL J shall J slay and him that escape from The Sword of je shall Elisha slay in this great vision anybody can read the Bible and know like you know oh well have preached about this and things but then in here we see that Elijah has G been given the prophecy Elijah comes and tells us that there are certain number of prophecies Vision that the Lord had given me in 1933 and he sees them to come to pass he said that oh i' would like to see them happen because even in the last Vision he saw himself all the way to the end that the last Vision he turned around and he saw the effect of the last Vision but we still here but he's gone and the prophet and Elijah also was also to anoint asahel was to anoint je was to anoint Elisha right but it didn't but then the prophecy cannot fail amen that's why knowing Jesus it's not knowing the form it's not looking at the one who's speaking to you but knowing him in his ways because in the book of Psalm it says that you know the going of the Lord in the sanctuary has is moving in the sanctuary is taking different forms and different shapes and fulfilling the very prophecy that he wanted to fulfill in different shapes because he has hided to The Prudent because any prudent say must come back around and fulfill this year that's why any human understanding will understand from reading of the word but then the Lord now reveals it to them babes such as we learn amen and only those who are ready to learn will be able to learn but those who are highminded have opinions about everything brother Bram said this I think it should be this way I don't believe that I don't see that way I've running into history I found that it is wrong yes continue so and the prophecy will be fulfilled right next to you and you won't see it and as the prophecy is being fulfilled fil the word comes about and we see that jeu must be anointed and Je holds a mystery in his life asahel holds a mystery in his life elishah also holds a mystery in his life and all these three people were born under the ministry of Elijah and everything that all these three people are going to fulfill is based upon the word that proceeded from Elijah amen right so everything else that will come after the departure of elij of Elijah is because Elijah said so Elijah tell told us that we I have seen these seven visions and these seven Visions will come to pass because it is that said the Lord but our highminded high learned people in this last days they said well no brother Bram is just like a man like us he's just another prophet he has he thought about saying this and I think I can also say this but they didn't know that when they were doing that they were fulfilling exactly what Elijah said but because they were not anointed to be among elij Elisha's group that's why they had to behave that way and because they were not part of Elijah's group they have to be ael's group or J's group and tonight we'll start with Jo's group until we get to Elijah's group and as we see while all these things are happening the Bible says in John 16:19 he said now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do ye require among yourself that I said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye ye shall see me verily verely I say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turn into Joy Hallelujah while all this prophecies happening the verse 21 and a woman when she is in she is in travail have Sorrows because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remember no more the anguish for the joy that a man is Born Into the world the timing that this prophecy was given and gives also other information how does anointing three people gets connected with a woman being in travel or in birth pain it's because all these two these two people people asahel and Je have sent to help Elisha or the bride or the church be ready for the delivery of the baby but then now je himself was a type of a spirit in the days in which we are living in and when this Spirit comes to be fulfilled there had to be reasons why this Spirit had to be fulfill because as jeu came into the world it was not just because everything was just fine or everything was uh according to God's word that J came to pass no it was because Jezebel was in the land why was Jezebel in the land because Jezebel came into the world took hold of all the systems turned all the profit onto herself and the word shows us that brother bam teaches us that Jezebel we know is the Catholic church and the Catholic church is a whole system of itself it's the Incarnation of the Devil Himself and this system went into the world and designed the world in the way that we know that we see them and when Jezebel went into the world they took over everything after taking over everything then the Russians says no we don't like this right all of you who study history will see that in the 1500s when the Catholic Church went to into uh Russia they said like you know these people keep getting rich and Rich and Rich nature and we are getting poor and poor over the days then they got kicked out but Jezebel when she came in she didn't come in as though she came to take the money she came in with the form of religion she came in with the form of Christianity she brought the Bible into the into the to the people you you you are pagans you don't know what you're doing we're going to show you how you're going to leave but then they started taking the very Bible that they were supposed to give the people and show the people how to turn them into Christians but then they started using all the resources of the people you don't need the land you see the Bible says oh you have to be poor and all these things that goes with it and then from there was born communism that's right and why is communism around and why is J Around And as communism was taking place as a little bit of definition it says a communist communist Society will entail the absence of private property and social classes and ultimately and uh ultimately money and State or a nation Gathering everything listen to this we have Jezebel standing on one hand taking all the resources getting everything with them but then on the other end the call Marks comes and say well the way we see things are being done here is not correct let's do a whole another thing of ourselves let's make everything common yeah remember that word common let's make everything comeon but they didn't see where that communism was going to lead them because it has to be God's way or no way and as je came into the land he started showing the people how necessary it was to cast out Jezebel yeah which was true but then at the same time they also took the Bible and cast it out and by casting the Bible out brother bam say you see that's where the mistake they did amen at the same time also because they had no repair they had no reference to go to because of God said it shall be so for you to be partaker of Elisha's group it's not by you're choosing for you to be part of the Bride is not by your willing because you can be still part of the church but you are not the church because you can still listen to the word every day but you are not part of it you can even preach the word but you are not part of the word because Judah found himself in the same position given all the position but because of money then a whole another Spirit took him over he wasn't fellowshipping with the cuses and the cuses he was in the very Church of the Living God as much as we see the church today we are part of the church because we like a certain pastor we like a certain the way the sound system is we like the way the women in that church is are people have all kinds of reasons and they see that it's very good that if I am common with everybody else then I can find my way through because in that day the many women will come and say just give us your name yeah we want to be Christians we we just just call me Christians but but everything else I'll take care of myself I have my money I'll pay my bills but let me just like you know by facade just be called that I am your wife just as we see with the politicians they live all kinds of life but then they say that this is my wife and that's what it is also with the church we are partaker of the church we may pay our tithes we may pay our offerings but we are not able to take the word within and that's where the communism Spirit begins and brother Bram says and that's where you are found trapped we're going to read it that's where you are found to be trapped you thought that you were smart you thought that you had all the understanding and knowledge but remember your life is tied to Elijah's prophecy your life is tied to the seven visions and in those Visions brother Bram says in the message the deity of Jesus Christ 194 uh 49 paragraph 122 Heavenly Father oh Jesus I'm looking forward for a great hour I see it coming what is the hour coming I see there is no hope no else nowhere else I see the age The Edge and moving up I see the great lights of Communism swaying around over the earth I see the formal Church taking the standard against your church trying to condemn them saying Divine Healing is wrong it's a bunch of fanaticism a build on our white or a build in on a bill in our own White House to close it down the hour in which the prophet was saying this in 49 he said it's coming I see it coming but people didn't say it in 49 but it was coming on the people am but people had to make a choice and at the same time 1949 the same time the Lord sends his Prophet on the field go find that bride go find that people and as he goes on it says well Mark Marx believed that capitalism with its emphasis on profit and private ownership led to inequality among citizens thus his goal was to encourage A system that Pro promoted a classless society to which everyone Shar the benefits of Labor and the state government control all the property and wealth they wanted a society where the state controlled everything but then all of us classless brother bham says one thing I can debate with him classless but in the vision he was standing up there and you were walking on down there but then here classless the pastor says one thing no I think I can have my ideas woman this is your position no I can do anything I want classless a society that marks wanted to do why because those who carried the word at first in the name of Christianity came with a whole different story they went into the lands they said like you know they found people naked they said like you know you how you how why why you naked we're going to show you how to dress we're going to teach you a new form of language we're going to tell you how to speak better ways we're going to make you civilize a civilized so Society but by doing that they had a whole different story behind was to take over just as he said in Matthew 4 he said all these kingdoms belong to me and he also wanted to bring the word itself to submit to him but then the word said no no no no thou shall Worship the Lord God Alone the word cannot bow to you that's right and it is a mystery today yeah to have people also who understand this mystery in this last day why communism is Among Us what is communism it's not the I'm not talking about the political system how to govern a city how to govern a country no we talking about what jail is what Elijah's prophecy is supposed to be and how it's going to pass and how it's affecting the people and each one of us will have to make a decision one of these days either I am embracing je communism as a hell or Elisha and in all of these places here the decision begins at the very moment that you're hearing this amen from the few examples because the uh brother Bram is in the message uh let deian Church age churches book he's showing us now these Visions he said like you know the third Vision was in the realm of in the world politics for it showed me that there would be three ISM fascism Nazism you know what it was and and the isue of it communism but the first two would be swallowed up into the third because the first two were the two ISM in the world that show showed us how to be civilized but then now when people were fed up with the first two then the third one had to come to pass and now the third one now the first two which will be swallowed up into the third The Voice admonished watch Russia watch Russia keep your eyes on the King of the North following now this communism has it going about it's showing us exactly what is happening when communism in a state of classless people not knowing their position people thinking that they Untitled because Fascism and N Nazism has given them all the knowledge of the world they said no we don't want that we're going to Pro provide ourself a better way and by trying to provide thems a better way brother bam says that in the for vision it was the advancement of science after World War II amen and as all these things was happening people started to learn because you remember you know the the history of uh of the United States living Europe for the freedom of uh of religion because they understood that the system in place was not the right system because they wanted to worship but then after coming to the US then they started their way then they forgot everything that they left the Europe to come here to do probably not the rest of the countries in the world have experienc the same things but also all of us came from somewhere and said that you know we don't believe the world anymore and we believe the message and we get into the message then we present a whole different type of Lifestyle now we we present a whole different type you know I am a Christian I was in when I was poor I was serving the lord and know all this and then all of a sudden now you have the knowledge you speak a better English you come from Africa you have a job now now all of a sudden who shall tell me anything I go to church when I want I show up when I want nobody will tell me anything yeah we are all equal you can tell me anything what to do I do what I need to do I look at you the way I look at you that communism Spirit and the prophecy says he that shall Escape as a hell swld shall Z kill him but if you escape Z and you come in the church I bet you won't Escape Elisha's sword tonight amen good because it has to come in Simplicity not in big words but then as the word is revealing this then we look into our lives because we can't stand and say like you know this church oh those people oh America is doomed say th said the Lord we are the bride yes that's good but now when we get here after World War II baram says I so science going higher higher learning higher understanding and with all that learning and understanding people will turn back from where they came from without even realizing people were transformed into the image of the Beast without realizing amen they were turned into the image of the Beast yet in the church because when Judah received the anointing of the devil to kill Jesus he was still in church because all the makeups and all the extensions and all the high heels are happening right in the church amen because they have quotations because they have understanding because we have opinions because we can also tell brother bam where he is wrong because we can show him is his mistakes because we can show him where quotation contradicts itself why because of Science in the for vision because of learning because now we can just have our iPad and just type the words and show like you know look look look look Ean 52 53 look at all the mistakes he did and J was swallowing them up they were not seeing it but they thought that they were smart of course you were smart of course you have wisdom of course we have all this knowledge very quiet tonight huh and in the fif Vision after all this learning and all this knowledge in the fif Vision the morality sets in right an issue with morality people walking about why because now I have the right and in the world they don't talk about human duties they only talk about human rights I have the right to do this I have the right to do that I can do this I can do that but they don't tell you what you have to do but they don't tell you what's your position but they don't tell you what you have to do because of these rights or everything that we do the way we do them Elijah gave the prophecy if you escape the first the third the third one will catch you if you say well it's the we are the bride we are the bride that's good but then under the fourth vision and under the fifth each one of us shall find Our Place what shall we do with this Jesus called the Christ what shall do shall we do with this message that we have in this hour amen why communism the world brother say proof of his resurrection and the world only oneir of them on in this Easter morning knows of heard about Jesus butam says 2/3 of the world is in communism and in darkness two3 but then anybody that went to school will look at like no we only know China to be the communist country no he's not talking about that we only know he like no but brother bam say America has become a communist Society but anybody that went to school who smart will say well no you're wrong this is a capitalist Society we have freedom we can do whatever we want exactly that freedom that's what communism is all about because when you don't see the devil and his tricks he's going to take you in without even knowing that's what Jesus said to Peter he said I have prayed for you because the devil really wanted to take care of you he was in church a fervent believer with revelation Peter with Revelation being right there in the church and it says experiences it says now there is coming a confederation of churches it's already National and they conf they're confederating and there's to great power IM moving in the world you know what they they are they are without telling they are without telling there is communistic power and the other one is Catholicism and communism is coming together one against Christ the other Catholic Church these two powers are coming together every person in the world is going to be under obligation to take sides with one or the other I know the way I'm presenting it not everything is lined up yet it's not it's not a sermon it's it's a Ser but I have to break it down slowly communism two3 of the world Elijah's prophecy is there everyone have to make a choosing because everyone has the opinions and in this age says the leodan church age this age is is the last of the of the seven Church ages what began in the first of Ephesian Church Ephesian age must and will come to full fruitrition and harvest in the last last o leodan age the two Vines will yield the final fruit the two spirits will terminate the manifestation in in each of their final destination yes each one of us we have to make a choosing amen either communism or either Isel or Elisha and despite of these three there's only two spirits and these two Spirits each one of us will make a choosing but then glory be to God the fact that the prophet has given us these informations the pillow fire has come down has given us these informations so we can be able to make our decision clearly so we can know that the path of what we are following will lead us somewhere because the fruit or the seed shall come back to seed again yes and as the seed is going into all the stages each one of us will understand already from the stages where we are what can the seed we shall bear at the End Amen and when we are seeing certain things thank God that we are not trees just standing on one place but God has given us a soul a mind of understanding to be able to make the choice and he has provided a way and God's provided way he said Elijah you shall anoint Elisha and Elijah's prophecy ended up with the rapture as Jew's prophecy ended up in ashes each one of us will have to make a choice and while these choices are taking place he said that you shall come to the to the destination the sewing the watering the growing is all over is all over summer is ended he is preaching is preaching it on the age level we know Le this year is over the sum has come up we've seen the cloud the seven angels and and all these things and but let not that blind you to be in the church to be called bride but yet when we walk outside we embrace all kind of lives amen and while these things are taking place we'll take the time to break it down into modern events why are things happening the way they're happening why is Putin behaving the way he's behaving why Iran is behaving the way he behaving why the the the top of Technology is going where it's going and why the wars are happening the way they happening in Africa specifically for them and all these things is to show that people have to make a choice and the church us also will have to make a choice and as we are making that choice understand what kind of seed you are putting in because the prophet has declared on on the age level like elishah did but now we also on the individual level as a family as a church as a community we also have to make the same choices right and when we are making those choices it's not a choice of the facade of just showing that I am I am I am because our very Works will prove was wrong our very Behavior will bring that to pass then you look and say oh really I never looked at myself that way time will come there's no need to rush because as the word is being laid down we seeing more than events before our eyes we are to understand which group are we part of Amen brother bam shows here while now this communist Society has been revealed displayed in the word people got all the knowledge in the history of America we have known Martin Luther King a very famous man out here for the black Comm black community oh we celebrate him he was such a great man for us but then he didn't understand what he was doing the country itself didn't understand what they were doing right because in their mind they communism will swallow Fascism and Nazism right not destroy but swallowed them amen you become what you eat by eating certain movies certain books and C certain places you become that person and by turning into that Society Martin Lu Martin Luther stands up and say no no no no no no no no Revolution we're going to need to be free all the schools that the white people go to we want to go to the same schools and some of the whites behind say well okay we also need them to come with us I know it's a very tricky subject in America when you speak about race and all these things people become tied up even in the church you can see that but we want to address it according to the word because the Bible the Bible didn't say black white yellow brown and all these things no it says azahel je and elishah and Elisha came from all over the world and communism we just read 23 of the world white black and everybody is in the same group yeah but then when communism finds his way among among the people he doesn't tell you I am a communist right nobody Among Us here will say I am a communist but our Behavior consciously and unconsciously will will determine who we are because you shall not see it's not by the words I speak I speak but by my fruit you shall know me amen because the seed is sold and if we have sown fism by disguise we have sown uh nism by disguise now we are communist it's not because I say I am a Christian love everybody I I as one of the brothers who preach here that uh I now accommodate everybody I can shake hands with him no we're not talking about that that's the facade let's read it in the Bible 2 King 9:30 and when je was come to jezrael Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face she painted a face communism now comes and brings us into all kind of forms you see somebody who Smiles at you but he's not smiling somebody who's greeting you but he's not he's not greeing somebody who's helping you but he's not helping why because Jezebel knows the end is here Jezebel can see that it is the end a bracket here to open the point in the Book of Daniel the king comes and say I have received a vision I have a dream something is going to happen something will happen he knows that he has a dream and despite the dream he said it is a very precious dream I'm not going to to show it to everybody I'm going to give it only to one the one is going to reveal it to me is the one that I'm going to deal with but look he knows what is going to happen you know the vision you know the dream Nebuchadnezzar's dream you see the statue you see the dispensation of time he sees everything they know that but because they know that that's what the end is he said I'm not going to die alone you understand he sees the vision he sees that gold brass silver iron iron and clay and this Stone comes down and he knows that everything that I've done all these years everything that I've built everything that I've invested in everything that I have presented to the world one day is going to be destroyed but there was Daniel and the rest of them that came from Israel into Babylon right and then in their turn only three out all those millions that came from Israel did not bow amen we are millions of us in the message we left Babylon and we came here but despite that not all of them were able to withstand the pressure of Babylon and that's what communist is people who are in the message we see them the way we see them we call them brothers we call them sisters but inside there's no real transformation Amen on and when the pressure comes quickly they give way because they only have the facade we only calling them brothers because they are in church but the true conversion that we are looking for is not found because in Elisha's group Elisha had to grow in the mantle of Elijah he didn't go and alter the the message say like you know oh I don't believe this oh this is before 1963 oh this I don't believe this I don't really think that you know everything is open he grew up in the mantle am that's why I don't want to sum up everything it's good to break it down and when Martin Luther saw that hey we have this opportunity now we have learned we have all this ability now to speak our voices we can gather the people we have white and black and all of us let's make a classless society and even themselves are according to history that the government and the system and the lobbyist and everything others were like no no no no we can't have the black Among Us and and all these things here they wanted to have the Jezebel system to keep lingering on but brother bam says Catholicism and communism is going to do what come together we can try to hold onto Jezebel system we can try to hold onto whatever we want to call it but understand at the end it's going to end somewhere and oh Lord and when je was come to jezrael and she painted her faces and tired her head and looked out of the window verse um to try to close here quickly and verse 32 and he lift up he lift up his head his face to the window and said who is on my side who and they looked out looked out to him two or three uh Unix and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and and on um and on the horses and and he troed her under her foot and when he was come and he did it he did eat and drink and say go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is the King's Daughter and they went to bury her but but they found no more of her than the skull the feet and the palms of her hands three things the hands the feet and the skull scull speaks of the Mind hand speaks of The Works feet speaks of the work right we understand when je comes and does his job when Fascism and social and and and nism is swallowed up into communism it seems like you know it's a whole different world now but it's not it is just the same devil taking a whole different form because it is still Jezebel taking painting or faces and when we come in the church many Jezebel that we have have painted their faces she doesn't like to be natural she wants to put some uh no I don't I don't like my hair I like to put a little bit something here why because knowledge has helped them out and that knowledge had led them exactly into the fifth the fifth uh the fifth Vision which is the moral of women and this immorality among the women it's not just the sisters but the churches too amen they rebel against the authority of God butam says Jezebel might not like it or not but Elijah was still her prop Pastor that's right we may like it or not the prophet is still the prophet and our behaviors and everything that we do I know it can hurt it can be hard to say but we have to say it and we have to show it by the prophet why we have to say these things it's not simple but we have to grow into that mantle and if we can grow into the mantle then we have to choose which are which one are we going to serve Martin Luther he went down and he starts telling the people say well you know let's have all this Society we don't need all this aggressions and we can be all this the following Vision the woman had the vote the right to vote she was able now to get into all the places she gets in there she's able to have a job now but look at where that led him all of us we have to work all of us we have to work and while we are seeking all these jobs and all these opportunities and all these things brother Bram says you'll excuse me my sisters that nearly 90% of them are prostitutes because they go in those places nearly 90% And that 90% who are those are going to stand today who are they we are there on the work on the job on the job job places we see them the way they behave you see them the way they behave she's unable to stay under the authority and from there now she goes into the greatest chaos ever if we have a 10% glory be to God as the prophet says I believe there will be some just as it was in Babylon so shall it be today there's nothing new Under the Sun this communism brother brother I'm say I'm not going to read brother says it's because we have forsaken the word that's why God had to release communism every single nation every one of us there is a stage where we believe the word we embrace the word we say Amen we go we move forward but then there will become a time then the squeeze will come I'm saying the squeeze will come and that squeeze is communism and that communism now will bring forth your character opinion opinions I think this I know this I but Elijah said you sisters your place is with your children but this cannot be received by everybody why the seed of the Catholic church is in her and that seed in the church will be watered will'll grow we go through the stages and we'll come back to maturity and at the end when it comes to maturity butam says then we'll have to take the CLE at the foot that's why I don't want to go move quickly with these things because it has to be clear before us and if you have the time you go you dig deeper ready so that when I come here I can just feel the inspiration going faster we always preach according to where the people as the people are pulling and as you are pulling as the word is coming as you are pulling as the word is coming but then let God help us amen I'm not just talking about the the sisters each one of us we have a responsibility and that responsibility we may not see it but we'll get to those places how communism has taken us into the action right we think that it's liberty no there's no Freedom you are a purchased possession we are somebody's property we may like not we may not like the term or not but we belong to somebody amen Christ paid the price for a certain type of people and that people are going to do exactly as he says and those people don't have any opinions everything he says is amen amen amen I don't understand but it's Amen but then when we have all our opinions we can see that I believe everything but this year I cannot do of course I can do this here of course but then at the end we're going to say we knew Jesus said let them grow together we will not cast you out we will still call you brother we will still call each other Sisters Jesus called Judah my friend it's by kiss that thou uh betray the son of man we will still call you friends but then because it has to be so but then when now the Gathering comes they come to tie you up it's either you go in the garden or before you go into the fire and the choices are ours true we see that communism that when Martin Luther I'm really trying to get to this here if you can allow me that when communism came in brother Ram says thir Exodus what about the other day when we had this question of segregation down in the south I wish that I could talk talk to to that Minister that Martin Luther King how can the man be a leader don't just look at it as a history Martin Luther is the father of the house pastor of the church mother of the children minister of the church and all these people were supposed to do a certain thing to lead them in a certain way listen to what what I'm saying he say like how can the man be a leader and leading his people into a death trap it seemed like you know this is a revolution that we need it seemed that the brother at home it's it's it's good for my wife to be out there on the streets it's reasonable anybody will tell you brother according to your economics according to all that we see our sisters our children they have all this knowledge our churches now we have read M you can present all the knowledge you can present I know it's hard but somebody has to say it amen it's not always comfortable for us to come here and preach me messages like this but somebody has to do it right because the Bible says I should not hide the whole Council of God if I have to choose what when we just get amen amen amen amen but then the author of the word one day will say like you know you were given that inspiration because there are so many things that you know somebody can preach upon but only him knows what going on Among Us you young people who are wanting to get married you young people who are married you parents with children and all of us we are facing this challenge here amen because of this leader brother B say how can you be a leader how can you be responsible that you are you are leading your house your home your church your everything into a death trap and not seeing it how can you be that because remember she is not going to answer for you but you are going to answer for everything right as brother around usually says here I am only responsible for this group here he's going to answer what did you preach who did you let on the pulpit and all these things he's going to answer butam say my children repeat what says the tapes because I'm going to answer for it is Paul also going to be churches say yes I have preached exactly like Paul if those of Paul go in me also I shall go in amen it's not easy because the pented face of Jezebel is showing us the opportunities I am this you are this we can do this now we can this and now this year it's not we we we we we we left Africa because of opportunities and all these things here it's good give all the answers and all the explanation we want but the word Remains the word amen the word wants you to be in that place he wants you to be in that place Minister be a true minister of the Gospel don't come here and and try to give advice on you know according to today's world and no there's not today's world the word is the same yesterday today and forever amen that's it's not easy but those things must be preached amen we have to pull and only those who are predestinated seed will be able to see this otherwise you'll walk out of here offended you walk out of here offended but the bride will be able to see that there is a fine line between the truth and wrong and Ahab ended up in Jezebel system because he was a borderline believer but now the work now is to pull everybody right in the midst of the land and that work must be done it's not easy it's not just fun for me to come here and then and preach a message like this we know what the bride likes right you are predestinated the seven seal the word made flesh amen amen amen we know that and the church will oh brother we like that message yeah we know that but then when God wants to do the work the gifts is to set aside a True Believer from the work because I'm showing what we are supposed to do because Martin Luther is looking he's Leading the People brother bam says listen to this then we'll close it says if those people were slaves I'll be down there my of beating away for for for them people they're not slaves they're citizens the C citizen of the Nations the question of going to school them people them people if they got a hard a hard heart and don't know those things you can't drive you can't drive into a people spiritual things what is bit in there with political Powers they've got to accept it be born again then they'll see these things for you to see this you must be born again then you'll see it but brother bam continues he said but this man the leader the pastor the mother and everything if I could only speak to him the prophet of the hour if it could only preach to him if that Minister could only preach the word leading those precious people under the name of religion into a death trap where he going to kill thousands times thousands of them they just get the natural side oh we'll make the money we want to have our caruse you only seeing the natural side of things but it says that you must be born again for you to be able to see it amen that's that's why all these opinions that we have can be detrimental to us but if we can be born again receive the spirit and to start seeing those things and we'll get to there now that you who have who have reached there you have the ministry huh you have the ministry and what are you doing with that Ministry because AEL and Al Elijah right because it's Elijah that went to a woman that was dying it's Elijah that went to a woman with a dead son it's Elijah that even when he died from his bones that the dead man came to life amen you can study that already ahead of time but I'm just giving you those places that we have to dig into so that it's not just oh it's hard why you telling us this and our place no no no no no there's a whole program we have to see Jesus and his program if I hurt you in your feelings somewhere Cal down hold on you're going to like it afterward this is just uh the the the the the the big plan the big picture so you can be able to see at times like you know we strike you know clothing and all these things but that's not necessarily the point because at the end of the day you are the bride ah now I have amen huh why communism who us who are leaders sitting in Heavenly as we say sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus huh by God's grace shall we pray Heavenly Father uh in humility and simplicity uh thank you Father for your grace thank you for your love as uh we are looking into these great things uh we know that the word the judgment begins in the house of God uh it's uh the Judgment for the bride is now because she's not going to stand in the Judgment time nor in the tribulation time because your Prophet warns us about all these things that are to come that's why we want to see Jesus and his program father lead us uh guide us Lord and reveal unto us Lord father God these wonderful things that you have uh laid in thy word as we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen if we can sing I don't know if we know the song my

calls me up there I I have to say what you put on my [Music] heart today Lyon and I were praying and in our prayer we were saying what brother Mark was saying a minute ago and what Brother Martin was saying that the spirits that are coming amongst us it comes in all forms and all shapes and it it tries to come through the window and under the door it tries to do everything it can you you walk outside and it's like you're just like this you're just trying to get clean and these Spirits are all around us but you know God said I'll raise up a standard against it than and I believe that's what the Lord's doing for yeah to preach that message that brother martin preached tonight that took some guts to say what the prophet said about the spirit that was in that day he saw those things he saw what was happening and I thank God for our ministry that they're pointing these things out and they're showing us these things am it's not about the black or the white or the yellow or the no what it's about it's about spirits that are contrary to the word of God and God has given us his word it's his word that it will not return void and his word is what heals us and keeps us and and establishes us can we raise our hand tonight and say I'm established on the word of God Amen God bless you Lord Jesus as we stand here tonight Lord we thank you for this church we thank you for our pastor and even though he's not here I believe he's doing the will of God he felt led to go to Africa and I pray that you would continue to use him and his wife Lord may you just continue to give him discernment and strength to do the will that you would have for him to do and Lord God we know that father the experiences that he's had and the things that he's gone through in life that he can share
