[21:01] on the wall the handwriting is there it
[21:04] took a prophet of God to let us know

[21:10] system it's in the word system amen amen
[21:15] and uh um I'm happy to be in church this
[21:21] morning I've had uh different ones say
[21:24] brother Ron are you done with the sermon
[21:27] or the subject of of trying the spirits
[21:29] within the message and uh uh I will be
[21:33] launching off into another segment or
[21:37] another inspiration of that same uh
[21:40] topic here in the next few days and uh
[21:43] going into things such as the
[21:45] discernment of spirits and so we'll be
[21:48] looking at that also um and so uh the
[21:55] other day I was visiting with my son
[21:58] Amos and Paul Maple and we were just
[22:02] fellowshipping and I love it when
[22:04] Brethren get together and you Fellowship
[22:06] around the the word of God am because uh
[22:10] you know the sports and everything I'm
[22:12] not interested in that I could care less
[22:15] who plays on what team and who's in
[22:16] first place I could care less there's
[22:19] only one player I want to
[22:21] be associated with and that's Jesus
[22:24] Christ amen he voted for me a long time
[22:27] ago so I cast my vote for him and I know
[22:29] I won't lose if I'm on his team so we
[22:33] were talking and I was fellowshipping
[22:36] with the Brethren and I said you know
[22:38] I've always wanted to preach on the
[22:41] thief on the
[22:50] cross
[22:51] so we want to look at that take a little
[22:54] bit of a detail look at that and dissect
[22:57] it down and everything and I think we
[22:59] can all
[23:03] identify turn with me if you would to
[23:05] the Book of Job chapter 14 then we'll go
[23:08] to Psalms 106 and then we'll go to
[23:11] Luke
[23:20] Hallelujah Job chapter 14:
[23:24] 13-
[23:27] 17 oh
[23:29] that thou wouldest hide me in the grave
[23:32] thou wouldest keep me secret until the
[23:36] Wrath thy wrath be passed that thou
[23:39] wouldest appoint me a set time and
[23:45] remember
[23:46] me if a man die shall he live again all
[23:50] the days of my appointed time will I
[23:54] wait till my change Come Thou shalt sh
[23:58] call and I will answer
[24:00] thee thou wil have a desire to work to
[24:04] the work of thy
[24:07] hands for
[24:09] now thou Nest my steps does thou not
[24:13] watch over my sin my transgression is
[24:16] sealed up in a bag and thou seest up
[24:21] mine
[24:22] iniquity I want you to
[24:25] notice in verse 13 that thou wouldest
[24:29] appoint me to a set time and remember
[24:33] me turn with me to Psalms
[24:37] 106 Psalms 106 veres
[24:44] 1-5 praise ye the Lord give thanks unto
[24:48] the Lord for he is good for his mercy
[24:52] endureth
[24:54] forever who can utter the mighty acts of
[24:57] the Lord
[24:58] who can show forth all his
[25:01] praise blessed are they that keep
[25:04] judgment and he that doth righteousness
[25:07] at all times remember me oh Lord with
[25:11] the favor that thou bearest unto thy
[25:14] people oh visit me with thy
[25:19] salvation that I may see the good of thy
[25:24] chosen that I may rejoice in the
[25:26] gladness of thy Nation that I may Glory
[25:30] With Thine
[25:31] inheritance turn with me now
[25:34] to Luke chapter
[25:43] 23 you know even as I was studying
[25:48] this and the Holy Spirit was
[25:51] really moving upon me I went into our
[25:55] bedroom Sandy was fixing her hair
[26:00] and I told her of this inspiration
[26:05] and and I just wept and
[26:08] wept and I shared with
[26:11] her a oneperson congregation and I was
[26:14] just sitting there preaching away and I
[26:17] pray that God will give us the same
[26:19] inspiration now saints of God how can we
[26:22] ever look at the crucifixion of Jesus
[26:24] Christ and not be touched I remember as
[26:28] a 9-year-old boy the first time I ever
[26:29] heard what was called the cross talk I
[26:32] was at Green o Ranch boys camp in
[26:36] California our parents sent us away to
[26:38] just get rid of us for a few days and in
[26:41] the summer and so we were there and I
[26:43] remember everything you had to do uh you
[26:45] had to anything you wanted to do in the
[26:48] camp uh to ride the train or to shoot a
[26:51] bow and arrow you had to memorize
[26:53] scripture and I thought that was so
[26:55] unfair because you know hey uh uh you
[26:59] know I wasn't good at memory and
[27:02] so oh my remember they gave me a a
[27:06] everybody got their own little verse and
[27:08] so they gave me one uh Romans 5'8 for
[27:12] God commandeth his love toward us that
[27:15] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[27:17] for us didn't know what it meant I
[27:21] thought what's that word commendeth his
[27:22] love what what what do you mean and
[27:25] everything and but I rode the train I
[27:27] shot the bow and arrow and it was given
[27:30] a Bible a little pocket New Testament
[27:33] and I wrote inside there Ron Peterson
[27:36] received this Bible because he was born
[27:39] again had no idea what Born Again
[27:43] meant but I sure L that little pocket
[27:46] Bible somehow I lost it and growing
[27:50] up I remember the first book I turned to
[27:53] was the book of Romans because we had
[27:56] just seen Ben her and Gladiator and
[28:00] Spartacus and all this stuff so I was
[28:02] thinking of Romans and fighting and all
[28:05] that so I read the book of Romans but
[28:07] how many of you love the Lord this
[28:09] morning isn't his word so
[28:12] precious okay let us read here Luke
[28:18] [Music]
[28:20] 23:32 there were also two other
[28:24] malifa LED with him to be put to death
[28:29] and when they were come to the place
[28:31] which is called
[28:33] Calvary There They Crucified him and the
[28:38] malifa one on the right
[28:41] hand and the other on the
[28:44] left then said Jesus father forgive them
[28:48] for they know not what they do and they
[28:52] parted his reignment and cast lots and
[28:55] the people stood beholding and rulers
[28:58] also with them derided him saying he
[29:00] saved others let him save himself if he
[29:04] be Christ The Chosen of
[29:08] God and the soldiers also mocked him
[29:12] coming to him and offering him
[29:15] vinegar and saying if thou be the king
[29:18] of the Jews save thyself and a
[29:24] subscription also was written over him
[29:28] in the letters of Greek and Latin and
[29:32] Hebrew this is the king of the
[29:35] Jews and one of the malifa which were
[29:38] hang hanged railed on him saying if thou
[29:43] be Christ save thyself and
[29:46] us and the other answering rebuked him
[29:50] saying dust thou not fear dust not thou
[29:54] fear God seeing that thou art in the
[29:58] same
[30:00] condemnation and we indeed justly for we
[30:04] receive the doe reward of our
[30:13] Deeds but this man hath done nothing a
[30:18] miss and he said unto
[30:21] Jesus notice he addresses him Lord
[30:29] and he said unto Jesus
[30:31] Lord remember me when thou comest into
[30:34] thy
[30:36] kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I
[30:40] say unto thee
[30:42] today Thou shalt be with me in
[30:45] Paradise may God add the blessing to the
[30:47] reading of his word you all may be
[30:50] seated this morning in the presence of
[30:51] God
[30:59] I'd like to title my sermon this
[31:01] morning remember
[31:07] me it's amazing how that the Bible is
[31:11] doesn't give us a lot of information
[31:16] about this thief who says
[31:22] this but I've always wanted to preach on
[31:25] this because it's always stuck with with
[31:31] me that this thief was admitting to his
[31:35] own guilt hey we justly are dying for
[31:38] what we've done we got
[31:41] caught this man has done
[31:44] nothing he says don't you fear God
[31:48] speaking to his other
[31:49] friend who is a thief
[31:54] also you know the Bible doesn't tell us
[31:57] was he B
[31:58] baptized doesn't say did you ever hear a
[32:01] sermon of Jesus
[32:03] Christ were you ever in his meetings how
[32:08] long did you serve him if you served him
[32:11] at
[32:12] all and let me dramatize on this a
[32:15] little bit this
[32:16] morning but you I want you to notice
[32:19] that the one on the left said if thou be
[32:21] the Son of
[32:23] God you see if thou be he didn't know no
[32:28] there was no Revelation he wasn't
[32:29] speaking by
[32:30] Revelation if thou be the Son of God
[32:33] take us down and you
[32:36] yourself do something do some kind of a
[32:39] miracle and we'll
[32:46] believe how it pricked the heart of the
[32:48] thief on the
[32:50] right and said don't you fear
[32:53] God see there must have been
[32:56] representation
[33:00] there had to been
[33:02] representation there in his life and he
[33:06] was predestinated unto Hallelujah
[33:11] election you see
[33:13] that talk about Grace and
[33:20] election you think about this
[33:24] guy you talk about coming
[33:28] as the door is
[33:29] closing or as it's coming down like this
[33:32] the last guy to slide right through
[33:35] underneath
[33:37] safe talk about as the door of the Old
[33:42] Testament was
[33:43] closing and right before the shedding of
[33:46] the blood of the Lamb of
[33:49] God so here all of the Old Testament
[33:52] Saints and this is the last one to come
[33:55] in at the last moment you talk about
[33:57] Grace and
[33:59] [Applause]
[34:04] election the Bible doesn't tell us that
[34:07] he was a
[34:08] disciple doesn't tell us that he got
[34:13] baptized doesn't say that he was a
[34:16] follower of Jesus Christ but there he
[34:22] is and I want to say this when we get
[34:25] over there in heaven and we we walk
[34:28] around and we begin to shake one
[34:30] another's hands and ask what church age
[34:35] what
[34:36] dispensation were you under and we will
[34:39] meet many different
[34:42] ones you will meet doubting Thomas that
[34:45] word doubting will always be there
[34:48] because you'll when you oh you're you're
[34:50] you're doubting Thomas yeah yeah that's
[34:54] me but I'm here
[34:56] anyway you will meet
[34:59] Rahab the Harlot she say that's me but
[35:03] by his grace I'm
[35:07] here you will meet many others you'll
[35:12] meet John the
[35:15] Beloved but when you come to this
[35:18] guy we don't even know his
[35:21] name you probably shake his hand and say
[35:25] hey let me have your testimony
[35:28] who are you what dispensation were you
[35:30] in uh give us a tell us how you got
[35:33] saved how did you make it
[35:37] here he'd
[35:39] say do you remember the thief on the
[35:44] cross he put his head down he said
[35:47] that's
[35:49] me you
[35:51] mean you weren't a disciple you weren't
[35:55] baptized you didn't hear the the words
[35:58] of
[35:59] Jesus and you made
[36:03] it how did you make
[36:07] it he said the man in the
[36:15] middle you think about Grace and
[36:18] election here he was at the point of his
[36:24] death and he had an opportunity to
[36:28] see Jesus
[36:30] Christ and he has
[36:32] only one sentence that he says to him
[36:37] and the word had never spoken to him
[36:42] before and he says
[36:44] Lord meaning
[36:47] Master remember me when you come into
[36:51] your
[36:56] kingom wow
[36:59] I want you to remember
[37:01] me in the most endearing words from
[37:06] Jesus as he's
[37:09] dying I tell
[37:11] you this
[37:13] day Thou shalt be with
[37:16] me in Paradise thank you Jes just think
[37:20] about it
[37:22] just a millisecond after his death after
[37:25] his heartbeats it's last time get guess
[37:27] what all of a sudden wow he's in that
[37:31] other dimension everybody's shaking his
[37:34] hand hey
[37:35] welcome wow and you know everybody
[37:39] rejoicing and he's
[37:42] going
[37:43] wow and everybody asking how'd you get
[37:50] here I don't
[37:53] know all I
[37:55] know is I said something
[37:59] and something
[38:03] happened so let me dramatize this just a
[38:06] little bit for you if you don't
[38:10] mind let me kind of go on the dialogue
[38:13] as if I'm the
[38:16] thief so he begins to tell the story
[38:19] because everybody wants to know how did
[38:20] you get here
[38:22] man tell us your testimony says well
[38:28] to begin with I got to hanging around
[38:30] the wrong crowd at a young age and got
[38:33] to doing things wrong and wasn't raised
[38:35] in church my parents were not
[38:41] religious and we got caught we got
[38:44] sentenced to death and there are three
[38:47] of us that were to be
[38:52] crucified but we were guilty because we
[38:54] had done wrong and we we knew of we do
[38:58] the crime we're going to do the
[39:03] time and we had been out doing some
[39:06] things wrong and stealing from people
[39:08] and we were put in
[39:10] jail and one of our colleagues who was
[39:13] with us he was caught at the same time
[39:16] and his name is barabus
[39:30] barabus they
[39:32] were as inmates in the same
[39:36] prison barabus and these two other
[39:41] malifa and no doubt that they probably
[39:44] conversed one with another and said hey
[39:46] man why are you in here why are you well
[39:48] barus was a
[39:54] robber and said we all hung around
[39:57] together
[39:58] and when we were in prison waiting to be
[40:01] sentenced we heard soldiers coming
[40:03] and they came and took barabus and Jesus
[40:08] from the prison cell now we tried to
[40:10] talk to this man
[40:12] Jesus but he never talked to us he was
[40:17] as a lamb dumb before his
[40:21] hearers and they took these two out and
[40:25] oh there was a great crowd out in the
[40:27] cour cour
[40:28] yard and there was
[40:31] a there was a feeling of
[40:34] hatred in the
[40:37] air people wanted blood for some reason
[40:40] they had heard there's going to be a
[40:42] crucifixion and like it was in the time
[40:44] of the the old west here in the United
[40:46] States when they said they're going to
[40:48] have a hanging it was a time for people
[40:50] to gather together families and have a
[40:52] picnic watch somebody get killed
[40:57] and the courtyard was filled and all of
[41:00] these people were
[41:03] there
[41:05] and Pontius pilot was saying do you know
[41:09] that it is a custom
[41:11] that this time of year that if somebody
[41:14] is going to be
[41:16] sentenced that we can take and we can
[41:19] choose and let one of them go
[41:25] free and he brought be barabus and we
[41:30] watched as they brought him before all
[41:33] of the
[41:35] people and said which shall I give to
[41:38] you
[41:39] barabus or
[41:41] Jesus the king of the
[41:45] Jews and they yelled all as though it
[41:49] was one voice give us barab
[41:54] us can you imagine they knew he was was
[41:57] a robber they knew the things that he
[41:59] had done and yet they chose someone like
[42:02] that over an
[42:05] innocent
[42:08] one who's being condemned and there was
[42:11] no sin he
[42:18] committed you could feel the hatred
[42:20] among the
[42:24] people they yell give us Robb us and he
[42:26] says but what shall I do with
[42:29] Christ turn with me if you would to John
[42:32] 18 because I love to follow this through
[42:40] scripture John 18:
[42:44] 36 Jesus answered my kingdom is not of
[42:47] this world if my kingdom were of this
[42:50] world then would my servants fight that
[42:54] I should not be delivered to the Jews
[42:55] but now is my kingdom not from
[43:01] hence and pilate therefore said unto him
[43:04] art thou a king then Jesus answered thou
[43:08] sayest that I am a king to this end was
[43:11] I born and for this cause came I into
[43:14] the world I should bear witness unto the
[43:17] truth everyone that is of the truth
[43:19] heareth my
[43:22] voice pilate said to him what is truth
[43:27] and when he had said this he went out
[43:30] again to the Jews and saith unto them I
[43:34] find no I find in him no fault at all
[43:38] this is the first time he is now Tried
[43:41] by the highest court in
[43:44] Rome and Pontius Pilate makes a
[43:47] declaration I find no fault at all in
[43:52] him you see the lamb has got to be found
[43:55] without spot
[44:03] blameless but ye have a custom that I
[44:05] should release unto you one at the
[44:08] Passover will you therefore that I
[44:10] release unto you the king of the
[44:13] Jews they cried then cried they all
[44:17] again saying not this man but
[44:21] Barabas now barabus was a
[44:24] robber chapter 19 verse1 and pil
[44:27] therefore took
[44:28] Jesus and scourged
[44:32] him and the soldiers plated a crown of
[44:35] thorns and put it on his head and they
[44:37] put it on
[44:38] him a purple robe and said hail King of
[44:42] the
[44:43] Jews and they smokee him with their
[44:46] hands pilate therefore went again and
[44:49] saith un him behold I bring forth you
[44:52] that you may know I find no fault in him
[44:58] then came Jesus forth wearing a crown of
[45:00] thorns and a purple robe and pilate
[45:04] saith unto
[45:06] them behold the
[45:09] man and when a chief priest therefore
[45:11] and officers saw him they cried out
[45:14] saying crucify
[45:16] him crucify him pilate say to them take
[45:21] ye him and crucify him for I find no
[45:26] fault in
[45:33] him well Thief who we don't even know
[45:37] your name tell us how did you get here
[45:40] well let me finish the
[45:43] story because I'm an
[45:50] eyewitness I was there when Jesus was
[45:53] brought before the people I heard him
[45:55] cry crucified
[45:58] I saw when they took Jesus out and they
[46:01] ripped off the robe off of his
[46:03] back and they tied him to a whipping
[46:06] post and I saw a centurion come and take
[46:09] a cat of Ninetails and I saw him
[46:14] scourged I saw him his flesh of his bag
[46:18] bloody and bruised and wounded
[46:28] and the more that they saw blood the
[46:30] more they wanted
[46:36] blood I can't explain
[46:39] it but there was something about this
[46:44] man there was something inside of
[46:48] me that when pontious pilate said behold
[46:53] the
[46:55] man I saw a man greater than a
[47:00] man he was more than a
[47:04] man I going to ask you what do you
[47:09] see do you see just the
[47:17] man
[47:19] behold the
[47:21] man there he was all bloodied and
[47:24] bruised opening not his
[47:29] mouth I watched him as they took him
[47:32] from the whipping
[47:34] post and brought him up and pontious
[47:37] pilot tried to wash his hands of it his
[47:39] wife even had a dream said don't have
[47:41] anything to do with this guy I've had a
[47:44] dream this
[47:46] night tries to wash his
[47:51] hands I don't know I'm not a religious
[47:54] man I haven't been to church
[47:59] I wasn't raised in church I hung around
[48:01] wrong
[48:04] people and I really can't explain what
[48:07] happened to me but when Pontius Pilate
[48:09] said behold the
[48:12] man something
[48:15] happened I don't know what you call it
[48:18] some may call it a
[48:20] vision but he said I saw him transform
[48:25] into a bloody lamb
[48:32] I don't
[48:34] know I'm not
[48:37] religious I don't know what was
[48:39] happening to me but something when he
[48:41] said behold the man I saw more than a
[48:47] man I can't explain
[48:52] it then the Roman guards come and they
[48:55] took us out of our cell
[49:00] and they said we're taking you now to be
[49:04] crucified and they said they made Jesus
[49:06] carry his
[49:10] cross on Via
[49:16] delosa we watched him we watched him as
[49:20] he carried under the weight of the
[49:23] Cross and how they were whipping him and
[49:26] how that
[49:27] it was such a horrible scene but said we
[49:30] looked into the faces of those in the
[49:32] crowd and there were some that hated him
[49:34] so
[49:35] vehemently they just yelled crucify
[49:41] him some took rotten food and different
[49:45] things that they could and threw it at
[49:47] him making fun and sport of
[49:51] him and yet I tell you there were others
[49:54] that we looked and they were they were
[49:56] weeping and wailing
[50:00] no no don't do this to him what is he
[50:05] done of what sin did he
[50:13] commit people mocking and
[50:20] laughing yet the others who called him
[50:22] Messiah they were there
[50:25] weeping till we came to a place called
[50:29] golgatha
[50:30] a place of the
[50:32] skull also known as
[50:37] Calvary and
[50:39] there the
[50:41] [Music]
[50:42] multitude came around
[50:46] us and the three of us were crucified
[50:50] yeah but how did you get
[50:53] saved man quit holding me in suspense
[50:57] what did you
[50:59] do to be
[51:06] saved he says hang
[51:08] on let me tell
[51:13] you it all happened so
[51:17] quickly events were transpiring
[51:21] and it seems surreal
[51:27] and I only spoke to him one
[51:32] time but when I
[51:34] did there was something inside of me
[51:37] that said call him
[51:40] Lord
[51:42] Lord remember
[51:48] me when you come into your kingdom
[51:51] because I had no idea when his kingdom
[51:54] will come I've got no idea is there life
[51:55] after death I don't
[51:57] know I've never lived by that I haven't
[52:00] gone to church I'm not
[52:03] religious but I know
[52:06] this the what few words I heard him as
[52:09] he was being brought before pontious
[52:12] pilot something resonated inside of
[52:16] me this man speaks
[52:19] truth there is a kingdom if my kingdom
[52:23] were of this world he said there was
[52:25] something about it
[52:27] yeah and I knew his kingdom he would
[52:31] come into it
[52:35] soon and
[52:37] so I spoke to him
[52:40] Lord remember me amen I don't know about
[52:44] you but I resonate with that myself this
[52:49] morning remember me
[52:52] Lord a lot of people say oh lord lord
[52:55] and I know him and stuff but will he
[52:58] remember them for there will become many
[53:01] in that day that say Lord Lord didn't I
[53:04] do this in your name didn't I cast out
[53:05] Devils didn't I do this and he said he
[53:08] never denied what they
[53:12] did but he says depart from me you
[53:16] workers of iniquity I don't remember you
[53:22] I didn't know you wouldn't it be
[53:24] horrible to to to get there and you say
[53:26] I know him I know him and when you get
[53:29] before him he who is omniscient and all
[53:32] knowing and he
[53:34] says I never knew
[53:36] you who are
[53:43] you what how did you get saved I don't
[53:54] know it was the man in the
[53:59] middle I can't explain
[54:03] it I don't know how I got
[54:07] here but I'm
[54:13] here brother Brenham says in the sardian
[54:16] church age now watch these seven spirits
[54:21] say now let me just stop here a moment
[54:24] before I do this
[54:26] because the
[54:27] thief that
[54:29] gets eternal life is on the right hand
[54:32] somebody say right
[54:34] hand and the thief on the right so you
[54:37] have a left and a right is that correct
[54:40] remember that certain things in
[54:42] scriptures have have
[54:45] meanings notice that he was on the right
[54:48] hand much of the Bible refers to the
[54:51] right hand of God I've told you there
[54:53] are five times more scriptures about God
[54:56] 's right hand than his left hand and I
[54:58] want to ask you is God
[55:00] ambidextrious does he only use his right
[55:03] hand well what about his left hand and
[55:05] you that are
[55:06] left-handed does that make you feel odd
[55:08] because you're left-handed because the
[55:10] Bible talks about more of God's right
[55:12] hand well no brother Brenham says and
[55:16] we'll show you the quote here let's just
[55:18] read this
[55:21] now now watch these seven spirits in
[55:23] other words holds his Messengers
[55:26] Messengers that will be Anointed with
[55:28] him with the holy spirit with this same
[55:31] holy spirit that Paul the first one
[55:33] Anointed with first 2 third fourth fifth
[55:37] 6th seventh all of them are in the right
[55:40] hand oh deriving their power and their
[55:42] light from his right
[55:44] hand he ascended on high and Phillip
[55:48] when he was dying or Stephen see I see
[55:50] Heavens open and Jesus sitting on the
[55:52] right hand of God it don't mean that
[55:55] God's got a great big right hand and
[55:57] he's sitting on it but right hand means
[55:59] right hand of
[56:01] power and
[56:05] authority little did this thief know on
[56:08] his right
[56:11] hand he would find
[56:14] power from God Joseph the Bible says sat
[56:17] at the right hand of
[56:19] pharaoh Jesus sat at the right hand of
[56:22] God the thief on the right hand of Jesus
[56:25] Christ
[56:27] and on the white Throne will he not say
[56:29] unto his sheep move onto my right
[56:35] hand it's a p it's a place of position
[56:38] and Authority listen
[56:41] closely the right hand doesn't really
[56:44] physically mean uh the right hand but it
[56:48] means to be on the right
[56:52] side oh thank you
[56:54] Lord I'm on the right right hand I'm on
[56:58] the right
[57:00] side it means the right location right
[57:06] position also meant
[57:10] Viewpoint or ability to
[57:13] perceive he the thief on the right
[57:17] hand
[57:19] Lord remember
[57:22] me wow
[57:26] is that all you said is that all you did
[57:31] yeah I had no other
[57:35] opportunity this was my
[57:37] only space of opportunity this was
[57:44] it spiritual food in due
[57:52] season one day turning it to the right
[57:56] look there was Jesus Christ just as
[57:58] perfect as Hoffman ever draw him
[58:01] standing there with a white wig on
[58:03] looking back down towards the Earth
[58:05] showing that he is supreme authority the
[58:07] heavens declare it the Bible declares it
[58:09] message declares it all the same supreme
[58:12] authority with the white wig on see his
[58:15] black beard
[58:16] under many of you have seen the picture
[58:19] we got it back there just turn it to the
[58:22] right sideways look at it there he is
[58:25] just as perfect perfect as it was if it
[58:28] had been photographed of him they're
[58:29] looking at it from the wrong angle you
[58:32] got to look at it from the right angle
[58:34] and only the Lord can reveal which is
[58:36] the right angle turn it to the right and
[58:39] look at
[58:40] it
[58:43] amen that's what he did with the picture
[58:46] amen he was looking at it this way I
[58:50] just see a cloud no you're not looking
[58:52] at it right turn it to the right angle
[58:55] he turns it what oh
[58:57] my there he is you see the perception
[59:01] the
[59:02] power the light of God coming from God
[59:05] himself letting you know that's more
[59:08] than a cloud
[59:10] amen that's why those who say well it
[59:12] was some kind of uh vapor trail of some
[59:15] kind of Rocket or they were looking at
[59:17] it
[59:18] wrong I'm sorry every time God does
[59:21] something in the Supernatural somebody
[59:23] with a carnal mind tries to give some
[59:25] kind kind of natural
[59:29] explanation they did it in the first
[59:31] Exodus every time there was well the
[59:34] Nile turned red because there was up
[59:37] Upstream something went wrong and it
[59:38] made the the water turn red look like
[59:42] blood and the fish and flies and fleas
[59:46] and everybody tries with a carnal mind
[59:50] to explain the
[59:54] supernatural but when you you look at it
[59:58] right right-and blessings you remember I
[1:00:01] I I spoke about the right-and blessings
[1:00:03] of God they are powerful there are
[1:00:06] things that when you have a right-and
[1:00:09] blessing you you feel it it's anointed
[1:00:12] it's God giving you a right-hand
[1:00:15] blessing but what about his left hand
[1:00:17] does God not use his left hand the Bible
[1:00:21] says on the left hand where he doth
[1:00:23] work on the road to a the two emus means
[1:00:28] Earnest
[1:00:29] desire the two disciples after the
[1:00:34] crucifixion they're walking along and
[1:00:36] they're
[1:00:37] sad and Jesus joins himself an invisible
[1:00:42] Union to them and says why are you so
[1:00:45] sad where have you been
[1:00:47] Buddy this same Jesus who we thought was
[1:00:50] it
[1:00:51] and was crucified and we watched him be
[1:00:54] placed in a tomb
[1:00:57] all hopes are
[1:01:00] gone and he began to take the scriptures
[1:01:04] concerning himself and he began to say
[1:01:05] but didn't this say didn't wasn't this
[1:01:08] the scripture and here and all of a
[1:01:10] sudden they begin to get a little
[1:01:14] excited right hand
[1:01:17] blessing but see right after rightand
[1:01:20] blessings watch this many times God from
[1:01:22] the right hand blessing he comes and he
[1:01:24] anoints you and he he gives you a great
[1:01:26] blessing and you feel so powerful oh God
[1:01:29] let me stay here and then turns right
[1:01:31] around and God moves under the left hand
[1:01:34] turns invisible
[1:01:36] again many times you will have a great
[1:01:40] time with God and there'll be a
[1:01:41] right-and blessing and then turn right
[1:01:43] around and the next morning you're going
[1:01:45] to be fighting the devil and find out
[1:01:47] where are you
[1:01:50] God he's there but just in the invisible
[1:01:53] Realm
[1:01:57] the thief is about ready to receive the
[1:01:59] full
[1:02:01] benefits of just a few
[1:02:04] words remember
[1:02:17] me in the sermon God being
[1:02:22] misunderstood and the Pharisees and
[1:02:25] Priests misunderstood stood him if thou
[1:02:27] be the Son of God bring yourself down
[1:02:30] off of there the thief on his left
[1:02:33] misunderstood him if thou be the Son of
[1:02:37] God take us off the cross save yourself
[1:02:40] and us too but the thief on the
[1:02:43] right understood him I want to ask you
[1:02:46] why did he understand him he want a
[1:02:51] churchgoer but he had representation
[1:02:56] my
[1:02:57] sheep hear my voice and a stranger they
[1:03:00] will not
[1:03:03] follow there was something that happened
[1:03:05] to me when Pontius Pilate said behold
[1:03:08] the
[1:03:10] man I asked before all of you this day
[1:03:14] Jesus
[1:03:16] Christ of
[1:03:18] Nazareth when he was crucified and I say
[1:03:21] do you just behold the man
[1:03:26] let him come out of
[1:03:28] History who do you
[1:03:31] see when you behold the
[1:03:38] man but the thief on the right
[1:03:41] understood him he said we have and we've
[1:03:44] done evil and we deserve what we're
[1:03:48] getting but this man's done
[1:03:51] nothing Lord remember me when you come
[1:03:53] into your kingdom watch the that voice
[1:03:56] come
[1:03:57] back today Thou shalt be with me in
[1:04:01] Paradise he understood that that was God
[1:04:04] dying for our sins I want to ask you how
[1:04:07] did he know that there was something
[1:04:09] inside of him that
[1:04:11] knew that the lamb must be
[1:04:15] slain there was something there was
[1:04:19] representation unto
[1:04:21] election let me tell you that these
[1:04:24] things that we are seeing in our minds
[1:04:27] and the revelations that God gives To Us
[1:04:29] by faith is because you were with him
[1:04:33] before the foundation of the world
[1:04:35] before anything was even said and done
[1:04:38] before you did good or
[1:04:46] evil
[1:04:50] predestinated unto
[1:04:52] election wow
[1:04:56] I don't know about you but when I think
[1:04:57] about that
[1:04:59] Thief we we get over
[1:05:01] there and we shake his hand which one
[1:05:04] are
[1:05:05] you I don't know what his name is the
[1:05:08] Bible is silent but he'll tell you his
[1:05:10] name he said but you remember the story
[1:05:12] of the thief on the cross on the right
[1:05:16] hand I'm the right-and
[1:05:24] thief he
[1:05:27] understood what was going on questions
[1:05:30] answers 64 brother brim says now I
[1:05:33] believe the reason Paul had to be
[1:05:34] baptized there because it's official and
[1:05:36] it's essential with the Bible that we
[1:05:38] are baptized because I take right back
[1:05:40] to this then when the thief was hanging
[1:05:42] on the cross he died without being
[1:05:44] baptized at all and yet with a promise
[1:05:47] that Jesus would meet him in Paradise
[1:05:50] that day in paradise not in the regions
[1:05:52] of the
[1:05:53] lost because it was the first time the
[1:05:58] opportunity was presented to
[1:06:01] him wow this is that
[1:06:05] thief's first
[1:06:08] opportunity and he took the
[1:06:11] opportunity he said the right words just
[1:06:14] like hady
[1:06:15] right you see sometimes you will Express
[1:06:18] with your voice you will say the right
[1:06:21] thing at the right time and it will
[1:06:23] please God and the pillar of
[1:06:26] fire tell them you can have what you
[1:06:28] have need of remember me when you come
[1:06:31] into your kingdom I tell you today thou
[1:06:33] shall be with me in

[1:08:18] seed the only way you can look at
[1:08:21] it and I want to tell you that
[1:08:25] if you make it it's not because of what
[1:08:27] you've

[1:19:02] for the children being not yet
[1:19:04] born neither having done he any good or
[1:19:07] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:19:09] to election might stand not of works but
[1:19:11] of him that calleth
[1:19:14] amen Romans 11: 1-8 I say then hath God
[1:19:19] Cast Away his people God
[1:19:22] forbid for I am also in Israelite of the
[1:19:26] Seed of Abraham and of The Tribe of
[1:19:28] Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his
[1:19:31] people which he fornew amen hallelujah
[1:19:36] what ye not that the scripture saith of
[1:19:38] Elias how he maketh intercession to God
[1:19:41] against Israel saying Lord they have
[1:19:44] killed thy prophets Dig Down thine
[1:19:46] altars and I am left alone and they seek
[1:19:48] my life but the Lord answered but what
[1:19:52] saith the answer of God unto him I have
[1:19:55] reserved to myself 7,000 men amen who
[1:19:59] have not bowed the knee to the image of
[1:20:02] Baal even so at this present time
[1:20:04] somebody say at this present time there
[1:20:07] is also a Remnant according to the
[1:20:09] election of Grace I believe I'm a part
[1:20:12] of that what about you I am a part of a
[1:20:17] remnant of all the thousands and
[1:20:19] millions of Christians on the face of
[1:20:22] the Earth I've got a little elect
[1:20:24] remnant
[1:20:26] an elect bride who has not bowed their
[1:20:29] knee to
[1:20:33] bail
[1:20:37] hallelujah
[1:20:38] hallelujah can God cast his people away
[1:20:42] God
[1:20:50] forbid even so at this present time also
[1:20:53] there is a Remnant according to into the
[1:20:54] election of Grace and if by Grace then
[1:20:57] it's no more of Works otherwise Grace is
[1:21:00] no more Grace but if it be of works then
[1:21:02] it's no more grace otherwise work is no
[1:21:05] more work what then Israel hath not
[1:21:07] obtained that which she seeketh for but
[1:21:10] the election hath obtained it and the
[1:21:12] rest were
[1:21:13] blinded according it as written God hath
[1:21:16] given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes
[1:21:18] that should not see and ears that should
[1:21:19] not hear unto this day
[1:21:23] wow so in church
[1:21:28] age Church age book brother Brenham goes
[1:21:31] this I just want to read this
[1:21:34] carefully in St John 6:37 and 44 it says
[1:21:39] all that the father hath given me shall
[1:21:41] come to me and him that cometh to me I
[1:21:44] will in no wise cast
[1:21:46] out no man can come except my father
[1:21:49] draw him I will raise him up at the last
[1:21:52] day John 1:12 through 13 but as many as
[1:21:56] received him gave he the power to become
[1:21:58] the sons of God even to them that
[1:22:00] believe on his name which were born not
[1:22:02] of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[1:22:03] nor of the will of man but of
[1:22:06] God Ephesians 1:
[1:22:09] 4-5 according as he ha chosen Us in him
[1:22:13] before the foundation of the
[1:22:15] world musicians if you'll come
[1:22:24] accordingly he has chosen Us in him
[1:22:26] before the foundation of the world that
[1:22:29] we should be holy and without blame him
[1:22:32] without blame before him in love having
[1:22:34] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:22:36] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:22:39] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:22:42] will now without getting too involved in
[1:22:45] this subject of the sovereignity of God
[1:22:48] for that would take a book in itself let
[1:22:50] me point out there that according to
[1:22:52] these verses Jesus Christ
[1:22:55] is choosing his own bride just the same
[1:22:57] as men chose their Brides today the
[1:23:00] bride today does not simply decide she's
[1:23:03] going to take a certain man for a
[1:23:04] husband no sir it's the groom who
[1:23:07] decides and chooses a certain woman for
[1:23:09] his bride John 15:16 you have not chosen
[1:23:13] me I've chosen you now according to the
[1:23:16] word of God the bride was chosen before
[1:23:18] the foundation of the world this
[1:23:19] choosing of the bride was purposed in
[1:23:21] himself Ephesians 1:9 Roman Romans 911
[1:23:25] that the P purpose of God according to
[1:23:28] election might stand you can't read it
[1:23:30] any other way the hard purpose the
[1:23:33] Eternal purpose of God was to take a
[1:23:35] bride of his own choosing and that
[1:23:38] purpose was in himself and being Eternal
[1:23:41] was decreed before the foundation of the
[1:23:46] world continuing on paragraph 281 now if
[1:23:50] we impute omniscience to God we must
[1:23:53] also accept that he is perfect in wisdom
[1:23:55] and
[1:23:56] righteousness this plan of election and
[1:23:59] reprobation is the wisdom of God
[1:24:01] revealed in all ages even as it says in
[1:24:05] Ephesians 1 3-11 blessed be the God and
[1:24:08] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[1:24:11] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:24:13] in Heavenly places in Christ accordingly
[1:24:17] has chosen Us in him before the
[1:24:19] foundation of the world that we should
[1:24:21] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:24:25] love having predestinated unto the
[1:24:28] adoption of his children by Jesus Christ
[1:24:30] to himself according to the good
[1:24:32] pleasure of his
[1:24:36] will now I want you to
[1:24:40] notice when did
[1:24:42] the thief on the right when did he come
[1:24:45] in had a changing of
[1:24:48] dispensation the door was
[1:24:51] closing for the Jews and opening to the
[1:24:53] Gentiles house and here we are once
[1:24:57] again a changing of
[1:25:01] dispensation God is going to because the
[1:25:04] days of the Gentiles is almost
[1:25:08] fulfilled I wonder if the last
[1:25:11] one that comes
[1:25:14] in might be just like that
[1:25:17] Thief that would just
[1:25:20] [Music]

[1:25:34] brother Brenham they didn't hear about
[1:25:35] the message of the hour and
[1:25:38] yet they were
[1:25:40] around and they were caught up in to a
[1:25:44] movement somebody testified to them I

[1:34:12] Sorrows that right and yet God delivers
[1:34:17] you from all of
[1:34:19] them this is unscripted
[1:34:24] it wasn't
[1:34:25] planned but my wife wanted to say
[1:34:27] something to
[1:34:33] you can I get your
[1:34:41] microphone I thought it might be better
[1:34:43] that I shared this instead of my
[1:34:47] husband but um I'm going to just share a
[1:34:51] little something that's personal or R it
[1:34:54] to me and um then I'm going to go on and
[1:34:58] explain but anyway when I made a
[1:35:01] decision to have the shoulder
[1:35:04] replacement um I had to wait 3
[1:35:07] months and I got a really good doctor so
[1:35:11] it was worth it to me and it's been
[1:35:13] something my shoulders been painting me
[1:35:15] for a long time and cordone shots didn't
[1:35:18] work for the last several years I
[1:35:21] couldn't raise my hand and work
[1:35:24] I couldn't even hardly clap with pain
[1:35:27] hard for me to brush my hair and
[1:35:29] different things and so I knew the time
[1:35:32] was coming I and I was ready for it but
[1:35:37] N9 days before I found a lump on my
[1:35:40] breast so it's really interesting
[1:35:44] because you you really never know how
[1:35:46] you're going to handle things you know
[1:35:48] you always think you're going to be this
[1:35:51] way or that way and
[1:35:54] I had
[1:35:55] such a
[1:35:58] peace no fear at all even right now I
[1:36:02] don't but I thought I'd share I'd go
[1:36:05] back in my life um when I was six years
[1:36:10] old I well I was raised in a Catholic
[1:36:13] Family 12 children my mom had 12 single
[1:36:17] births in 16 years and I was in the
[1:36:19] middle I was very shy and very very
[1:36:22] insecure
[1:36:24] my
[1:36:25] dad we had no relationship with my
[1:36:28] father and I I don't think he knew
[1:36:32] how but
[1:36:35] um I I needed a father and so 6 years
[1:36:40] old I can
[1:36:42] remember I don't know what prompted it
[1:36:45] but I went into my
[1:36:47] closet and I started talking to
[1:36:51] him you know you could say prayer but
[1:36:54] for me it was talking
[1:36:57] and you know I was hurt and really
[1:37:02] crying within me and I went to him and I
[1:37:07] got in my closet and I poured my heart
[1:37:10] out to
[1:37:12] him and I can remember I mean you know
[1:37:15] in the Catholic Church you only are Tau
[1:37:17] to prayers I can remember walking out of
[1:37:21] that closet and I felt love like I had
[1:37:25] never felt before and so much
[1:37:29] comfort I can actually say that's where
[1:37:31] my relationship started with the Lord
[1:37:35] and from then on I was back in that
[1:37:38] closet back in the closet but also
[1:37:41] everywhere I went I prayed and I was
[1:37:43] such I was just a little girl that was
[1:37:46] so little I understood but you know what
[1:37:49] as time went on I actually felt like I I
[1:37:53] I had a father and that security was
[1:37:56] building up in me and I was figuring out
[1:37:59] even already who I was and I
[1:38:02] remember I mean I understand that from
[1:38:05] the day my natural birth I was my life
[1:38:09] was already planned out you know you're
[1:38:12] going to grow as you mature in life and
[1:38:15] you're going to go through the steps
[1:38:17] that bring you to the Holy Ghost and
[1:38:20] Beyond but with me
[1:38:27] my walk did grow and I mean I know I
[1:38:31] never fit into my family and they even
[1:38:33] knew it cuz I was different and I could
[1:38:38] actually say
[1:38:41] I my dad was a
[1:38:43] very Stern Catholic man but yet you know
[1:38:48] smoking and drinking and parting that
[1:38:50] was all in in the family I don't know
[1:38:53] how I grew up in this family and never
[1:38:55] did nothing but give it to the Lord I
[1:38:58] felt he had a hedge about me but I went
[1:39:02] to go back I as time went on whenever I
[1:39:07] went through a hard time whether it was
[1:39:09] grade school to high school and I went
[1:39:12] into prayer I had this imagery and it
[1:39:16] always brought me back even to this day
[1:39:20] to where I was walking with the Lord and
[1:39:23] he was holding my hand I was looking up
[1:39:26] at him but I was always 6 years
[1:39:30] old I felt because it was my
[1:39:33] beginning and every time I've gone into
[1:39:37] prayer and crying over something it
[1:39:40] always came back it was like my own
[1:39:42] personal Vision there I was and then I
[1:39:45] realized everything's going to be okay
[1:39:47] cuz he's holding my hand and I can only
[1:39:50] say through this that I I felt such a
[1:39:55] peace and just so
[1:39:58] comforted and you know you start
[1:40:00] thinking in your head like okay now what
[1:40:03] am I going to do and I got this surgery
[1:40:06] do I go forward with the surgery it
[1:40:09] probably sounded to the normal person
[1:40:12] pretty stupid because there would be a
[1:40:14] lot of pain that would come with it but
[1:40:17] I just felt good about it and Ron was
[1:40:20] fine and so I just went forth and I and
[1:40:22] I did did it but I also went ahead and
[1:40:26] did a mammogram and an
[1:40:28] ultrasound I and then when I got back
[1:40:31] from New York I had a biopsy and I have
[1:40:35] they found out I had um I had a lump in
[1:40:38] my breast that already found it was 7 mm
[1:40:42] and um so they have planed for the next
[1:40:46] week or so they're trying to move it up
[1:40:49] for a pet scan to see if it has gone
[1:40:52] through my body
[1:40:53] but
[1:40:55] I I I told Ron I mean I feel like my
[1:41:00] whole life has been Miracles I've
[1:41:02] watched God do my miracles in my life
[1:41:04] since I was a little girl and I'm like
[1:41:08] honey I'm going to hold on for a miracle
[1:41:11] I believe in
[1:41:13] miracles but also you know what this
[1:41:16] might sound crazy you guys but I'm
[1:41:18] perfectly fine to go on to be with the
[1:41:20] Lord I have no you know there's nothing
[1:41:24] there I have no I mean if the Lord said
[1:41:27] tomorrow I'd say I'm
[1:41:29] ready I'm just you know what but you
[1:41:32] know the hard part is not me it's it's
[1:41:35] my family it's it's it's wrong it's it's
[1:41:39] hard for your family it's easy to say
[1:41:42] I'm ready an early Rapture I'm going but
[1:41:46] for me it's always been what the about
[1:41:49] what's the lord's will for my life I
[1:41:51] just want his will
[1:41:53] and I you know what I'm like I'm
[1:41:56] skipping chemo forget it I'm going to go
[1:41:59] straight to the
[1:42:00] miracle I just I'm just I just know that
[1:42:05] all it is is what's in his plan for me
[1:42:08] and it's just one touch away if that's
[1:42:11] what he wants and if that's not what if
[1:42:14] the future is he wants to take me home
[1:42:17] it's going to be him either way and I'm
[1:42:19] happy with it and like I said is I do I
[1:42:23] I feel like I am I am so happy right now
[1:42:26] even though I'm going through this it's
[1:42:28] not affecting me negatively but it it is
[1:42:32] it's hurting me because I see how it
[1:42:33] hurts my husband and my kids are taking
[1:42:36] a little bit hard they like Mom you got
[1:42:39] to do something I am I'm just placing it
[1:42:43] in the Lord's hands like I have all
[1:42:45] these years and of course when I went
[1:42:48] to praying and I have been you know just
[1:42:52] praying a lot there's there I am I'm
[1:42:55] walking with the Lord he's holding my
[1:42:58] hand I always am looking up at him but
[1:43:00] I've never seen his face but I always
[1:43:02] knew it was him and um I
[1:43:07] just you know what sometimes are the
[1:43:10] children think they're too young but
[1:43:11] they're not your relation can can
[1:43:14] relationship with the Lord can start so
[1:43:17] young and you know what once you give
[1:43:19] your will over to him that you want him
[1:43:22] to be the one one that grows you up man
[1:43:25] he'll protect you from everything I
[1:43:28] actually think with kids that are maybe
[1:43:31] struggling with wanting the Holy Ghost
[1:43:34] all it is is laying your will down and
[1:43:37] asking the Lord to to for his will in
[1:43:41] your life he's going to give you the
[1:43:43] Holy Ghost to guide you it's so simple
[1:43:47] it's just he can't do it if you won't
[1:43:48] let go of your own will he can't do it
[1:43:51] if you won't you're not not willing to
[1:43:53] die to your own desires and your own
[1:43:56] things you just got to give it to him
[1:43:59] that's how I I grew up and that's where
[1:44:01] of course the Lord would lead me by
[1:44:04] election to the
[1:44:06] message and um it's been an amazing
[1:44:10] journey with the Lord and um I just want
[1:44:13] to say so you all can pray for me but
[1:44:16] don't worry about me I'm in God's hands
[1:44:20] and um I love you all so much
[1:44:23] and I look over the congregation I don't
[1:44:26] see any faults I see perfect people and
[1:44:30] I just love you and U thank the Lord for
[1:44:33] you all the time God bless
[1:44:36] [Applause]
[1:44:48] you he's got it all in control
[1:44:55] I
[1:44:57] know that our lives are in his
[1:45:00] hand my wife said I want to address the
[1:45:05] church I want to
[1:45:08] Daddy I don't want you to have to say it
[1:45:10] I don't want it done in a text I want to
[1:45:12] tell my
[1:45:14] kids
[1:45:16] myself I said all
[1:45:19] right she is one
[1:45:21] that those of you that have known us for
[1:45:24] many
[1:45:26] years it's always hard for Sandy to get
[1:45:29] up in front of a
[1:45:31] group but today she said I want my
[1:45:35] church up until this time there's just
[1:45:37] only been my family and a couple people
