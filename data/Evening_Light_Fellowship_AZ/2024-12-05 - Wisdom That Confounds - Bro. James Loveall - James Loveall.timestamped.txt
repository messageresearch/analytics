[30:45] 2 and proverbs 4 thank you
[30:53] musicians it's hard to believe it's the
[30:56] last month of the year
[30:58] how fast time is
[31:00] going seems like this past year there's
[31:02] been a lot of valleys a lot of
[31:05] Trials seems a little bit more than
[31:08] mountain tops but that's okay he said
[31:10] I'll be with you even in you until the
[31:12] end of the
[31:13] world and yet you're still here you're
[31:16] still here you're still fighting you're
[31:18] still at your Posta Duty on a Wednesday
[31:20] night
[31:24] Sir so if you look in Proverbs 2 in
[31:28] verse
[31:29] one we're just going to read to verse 11
[31:32] and I'll emphasize afterward a few of
[31:35] the scriptures but let's just read this
[31:37] passage here my son if thou Wilt receive
[31:40] my
[31:41] words and hide my Commandments with thee
[31:44] so that thou incline thy hearing unto
[31:47] wisdom and apply thy heart unto
[31:49] understanding yeah if Thou criest after
[31:52] knowledge and lifteth up thy voice for
[31:55] understanding if thou seekest her as
[31:57] silver and searches her as for hid
[32:02] Treasures then Thou shalt understand the
[32:05] fear of the Lord and find the knowledge
[32:08] of
[32:09] God for the lord giveth wisdom out of
[32:13] his mouth cometh knowledge and
[32:15] understanding he layeth up sound wisdom
[32:18] for the righteous he is a buckler to
[32:21] them that walk
[32:23] uprightly he keepeth the paths of
[32:25] judgment and preserveth the way of his
[32:27] the Saints then Thou shalt thou
[32:31] understand righteousness and judgment
[32:34] iniquity yay every good path right when
[32:39] wisdom entereth into thy heart and
[32:42] knowledge is Pleasant unto thy Soul
[32:45] discretion shall preserve thee
[32:48] understanding shall keep
[32:51] thee let's turn to proverbs 4 and verse
[32:54] 5 few pages over
[33:01] verse 5 reads get wisdom get
[33:03] understanding forget it not neither
[33:07] decline from the words of my
[33:09] mouth forsake her not and she shall
[33:11] preserve thee love her and she shall
[33:15] keep
[33:16] thee wisdom is the principal
[33:20] thing therefore get
[33:22] wisdom and with all thy
[33:25] getting get understanding am you can
[33:28] have your seats this
[33:30] evening so as we read here in Proverbs a
[33:33] few scriptures i' would like to look at
[33:35] here in verse two says in Proverbs 2 it
[33:39] says so that thou incline thine hearing
[33:42] they hear unto wisdom and apply thy
[33:46] heart to understanding y If thy criest
[33:50] after knowledge and lifteth up thy voice
[33:54] for understanding you see sometimes God
[33:56] just doesn't give you everything that
[33:58] you have to know sometimes you're going
[34:00] to have to cry a cry after understanding
[34:03] we live in a society that is if you ask
[34:06] of something you expect it to receive it
[34:08] now but here the scripture is saying
[34:11] incline thine ear sometimes you got to
[34:13] increase your ear unto
[34:16] hearing yeah you have to get into the
[34:19] scriptures you have to listen to the
[34:20] tapes incline thy
[34:24] hearing to get wisdom
[34:28] and you have to
[34:30] apply thine heart to get
[34:37] understanding and if th criest after
[34:41] knowledge sometimes it takes your voice
[34:44] to call unto God to bring him on the
[34:46] scene
[34:48] amen you know many times that we get
[34:50] slack in our ways and we begin to think
[34:53] that you know it's easier to ask our dad
[34:55] for wisdom or ask our p and go to
[34:58] different ones and say what would you do
[35:00] in this situation how should I handle
[35:02] this situation but the Bible's telling
[35:05] us sometimes you got to apply your heart
[35:07] to get understanding you're going to
[35:09] have to apply
[35:12] yourself very
[35:14] good the scripture here that we read for
[35:16] wisdom and understanding is what's going
[35:19] to keep
[35:20] you it's not your pastor's Revelation
[35:23] it's not your parents' Revelation or
[35:25] understanding it's not the knowledge
[35:27] that they have
[35:31] but you are kept by the power of
[35:35] God and as I begin to look at this
[35:39] thought that I was you know just begin
[35:41] to ponder over and I believe as an
[35:44] individual if we can get one thing and
[35:46] that we need more of each one of us can
[35:48] say that we need more wisdom we need
[35:51] more understanding of who God is and the
[35:53] wisdom to apply it to our lives
[36:02] you see not
[36:04] every not everyone will see it the way
[36:06] you do sometimes God shows you things he
[36:09] gives you thoughts and he he begins to
[36:10] reveal himself unto
[36:12] you but yet it's not for everybody
[36:17] else it begins to deal with your heart
[36:19] and I believe that whenever you get
[36:21] wisdom and understanding you begin to
[36:23] grow in
[36:24] Christ you know for us to gain wisdom it
[36:29] just doesn't help us just in our
[36:31] spiritual walk it just doesn't help us
[36:34] in our natural or in our spiritual walk
[36:36] with Christ and being able to understand
[36:38] the scriptures more but wisdom begins to
[36:41] allow you to understand how to be a
[36:43] better father how to be a better son how
[36:46] to be a better
[36:49] friend because how do I handle this
[36:51] certain
[36:53] situation maybe you have an argument
[36:55] with your son and you begin to battle it
[36:58] out and you begin in this big old
[36:59] argument and you don't know how to
[37:01] handle it well you're lacking in wisdom
[37:03] maybe you handled it wrongly maybe you
[37:06] approached it wrong right maybe you have
[37:09] a disagreement in the church and you
[37:11] approach this brother and I'm going to
[37:12] tell him a piece of my mind but yet in
[37:15] wisdom we approach it wrongly that's why
[37:19] I say God give me more
[37:25] wisdom you see wisdom
[37:29] not only will make us a better father or
[37:32] mother brother sister it'll help us in
[37:36] our ministry it'll help us in our posted
[37:39] duties amen
[37:46] right Paul said I didn't come in man's
[37:51] Wisdom but in the power and the
[37:53] demonstration of the Holy Ghost why why
[37:56] did Paul have to go in this that way why
[37:58] did he say I come not of my own wisdom
[38:01] not of my own reasoning why because you
[38:03] become dependent upon your own man's
[38:05] carnal reasoning
[38:08] right I didn't come to to preach a
[38:11] sermon to try to impress you I didn't
[38:13] come to show you how much I know or how
[38:15] much I studied on a certain
[38:17] thought that's not why we're here
[38:20] because if the Holy Spirit doesn't come
[38:22] and the Divine revealer of the word come
[38:24] and reveal it to your heart it does no
[38:26] good
[38:28] yes sir the L kth but it's the spirit
[38:32] that giveth
[38:36] life you see man's Wisdom will never
[38:39] produce
[38:41] anything it takes the wisdom and
[38:43] revelation of God mixed with the word to
[38:46] produce something ever since the very
[38:49] beginning of time Satan couldn't produce
[38:51] wisdom and he can't produce knowledge
[38:53] but what does he do he perverts it
[38:59] we read in our Bible and Jesus used his
[39:01] people in in so many different ways that
[39:05] if we look at it from a hum a human
[39:07] element it doesn't make sense to
[39:12] us he uses Moses to deliver his people
[39:16] from Egypt with a
[39:18] stick explain that one right he told
[39:22] Joshua to go and March around the walls
[39:24] and they'll fall how does that make
[39:26] sense
[39:28] right right he used Jonah in the belly
[39:31] of a well and as science continues to go
[39:33] on they can try to disprove
[39:35] God you can't disprove this
[39:40] word it's our human element of wisdom
[39:44] and our own reasoning is what hinders us
[39:47] in our walk with God so let me ask you
[39:50] what is God asking you to
[39:53] do that you think is too hard and it's
[39:56] too great and I could never do that and
[39:59] I can never be
[40:10] that so this thought that I that came to
[40:13] me was a wisdom that
[40:16] confounds wisdom that confounds you see
[40:19] Jesus spoke in
[40:20] Parables he said eat this flesh eat my
[40:23] flesh drink my blood and the people said
[40:26] what is he a vampire
[40:28] who can believe these
[40:31] things when a blind man came to Jesus he
[40:34] said you know I'm a blind man I've been
[40:37] blind since my birth and and Jesus he
[40:40] spit in the sand and he rubbed dirt on
[40:41] his eyes if he was the son of man why
[40:44] didn't he just heal him why didn't he
[40:46] just speak to the blinded eyes because
[40:49] it wasn't for
[40:50] everybody he did things to confound
[40:53] those he he did it to confound the
[40:55] majority yes sir that's right
[41:03] he hid it from the wise and The Prudent
[41:05] and he revealed it unto those such it
[41:07] would
[41:09] learn it's against human expectation you
[41:12] see wisdom that works in it it works in
[41:15] let's say a mysterious ways it's
[41:18] mysterious to us but not to God
[41:25] right wisdom that confound
[41:28] it confounds the wise it confounds the
[41:30] majority you see they missed Jesus in
[41:33] his day when Jesus came to Earth they
[41:35] missed him why because he didn't come
[41:38] the way they thought he
[41:40] would how can a virgin conceive to the
[41:43] human mind that doesn't make
[41:46] sense but it wasn't supposed to to
[41:50] them when Jesus came they thought he
[41:53] would come in a certain uh class of
[41:55] people he would come to to those of the
[41:57] highs to the Pharisees those of the
[42:01] intellectual but he came as a baby in a
[42:04] manger and the world missed
[42:06] him why because it didn't come according
[42:09] to human
[42:15] wisdom and yet people today are still
[42:17] missing
[42:18] him they're still missing
[42:22] him they're missing him in their
[42:24] churches because they try to put on they
[42:26] have to put on a a program in order to
[42:29] impress the
[42:31] people that it has to happen a certain
[42:34] way and you got to entertain the people
[42:36] and they're still missing Christ for
[42:39] this day because he doesn't come the way
[42:41] they thought he would and I'm going to
[42:44] say tonight I don't want to miss the
[42:46] coming or I don't want to miss what God
[42:48] is doing in this day I don't want to
[42:50] miss what he's doing in this hour to
[42:52] with his
[42:53] bride I don't want to miss it due to my
[42:56] lack of wisdom due to my lack of
[42:58] knowledge because I didn't cry out I
[43:00] didn't seek I didn't ask
[43:08] God it may come in ways that we least
[43:14] expect you see God's ways are above our
[43:16] ways
[43:19] amen sometimes we ask him to God I need
[43:22] you to come closer so he sends him us a
[43:24] trial
[43:33] sometimes we believe that God's A Healer
[43:36] and he sends us a sickness and he says
[43:38] now
[43:40] believe let me see your faith put in
[43:46] action because so many times we want a a
[43:49] move of the Holy Spirit and we want God
[43:52] to to to to boost us and get us jumping
[43:55] and shouting or just encourage us and
[43:58] yet sometimes he comes in just ways that
[44:01] man are hard to
[44:05] understand to our carnal
[44:11] understanding James 1 and2 says my
[44:13] brother en counted all joy when you fall
[44:15] in diverse
[44:18] Temptations how does that make
[44:20] sense to count it all
[44:23] joy when you fall into these Temptations
[44:26] why why because God's working on you
[44:28] he's molding you he's refining that
[44:31] character of you amen because it's the
[44:34] trying of your
[44:36] faith it's the trying of your faith that
[44:39] worketh
[44:40] patience but let patience have her
[44:42] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[44:46] entire wanting
[44:49] nothing you see he sends a temptation to
[44:51] perfect
[44:53] you he sends a
[44:55] trial he sends something in our
[45:01] lives I read that to
[45:04] say verse 5 and if any of you lacking
[45:09] wisdom if any of you lacking
[45:12] wisdom you say what am I lacking in how
[45:14] am I lacking in
[45:16] wisdom what is your attitude when
[45:18] Temptations
[45:20] come do you have the joy of your
[45:24] salvation how is your attitude when the
[45:27] trial
[45:30] comes you said many times we get we get
[45:34] hard we ask God when is this trial going
[45:37] to be over when is this sickness going
[45:39] to be when am I going to be healed of
[45:40] this
[45:42] sickness and here he is trying to
[45:44] encourage you incline get wisdom because
[45:48] when you understand the wisdom of it
[45:50] that it's God working his he's trying to
[45:53] mold you and make you
[45:59] in verse six but let him that ask in
[46:02] faith not
[46:04] wavering you see when you ask something
[46:06] of God don't waver in it when you ask in
[46:10] faith believe it and move
[46:13] on because whenever you begin to waver
[46:15] when you begin to second guess and you
[46:18] begin to come forward time and time
[46:21] again have faith and move
[46:24] on believe in God because God God is
[46:27] going to bring that to pass in his
[46:34] time notice the Scripture it says wisdom
[46:37] first then
[46:40] understanding and then Faith to believe
[46:43] it why is wisdom so important as I begin
[46:47] to look at wisdom and you know as an
[46:50] individual and as a young Minister I I I
[46:53] counted a very of great importance
[46:58] because wisdom is one of those things
[47:02] that God uses and he comes and he
[47:04] ministers unto you and it's something
[47:06] that only God can give yes you can get
[47:09] wisdom from you know a a mentor or a
[47:12] pastor or maybe your father or somebody
[47:15] older yet W the wisdom of God is
[47:17] something
[47:19] special it's something that only he can
[47:22] give you know many times we can get
[47:24] complacent within our lives of I've
[47:27] heard that sermon before I've heard that
[47:29] Minister preach before oh it's just
[47:31] James preaching this Wednesday or it's
[47:33] just this brother or I've heard that
[47:34] thought before and we become knt alls
[47:37] within ourselves come on that's
[47:40] good oh I've heard that before I've
[47:43] heard that
[47:46] Minister oh it's just a Wednesday
[47:54] night why is wisdom so
[47:59] important because it was the very first
[48:01] thing that Satan promised Eve that he
[48:05] would hybrid in the
[48:09] garden Satan was so subtle in the garden
[48:13] and as he began to work on Eve he began
[48:15] to talk to her and woo her and he began
[48:18] to tell her things that she' liked to
[48:23] hear and then eventually Eve began to
[48:26] take Satan's wisdom over God's
[48:29] word let's read it in Genesis 3 and it
[48:32] says and the serpent serpent said unto
[48:34] the woman ye shall not surely die for
[48:38] God do know in the day they eat thereof
[48:40] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[48:42] shall be as Gods knowing
[48:44] good and evil knowing there's the
[48:49] knowledge and when the woman saw that
[48:51] the tree was good for food and it was
[48:54] pleasant to the eye and a tree to be Des
[48:56] desired to make
[48:58] one
[49:01] wise the NIV version says desirable for
[49:05] gaining
[49:07] wisdom he was promising Eve
[49:10] wisdom he was promising her
[49:13] knowledge he began to pull her away
[49:17] through the subtlety of
[49:20] words and she partake of
[49:23] it and did eat and gave to her husband
[49:26] and they did eat and their eyes were
[49:28] opened and they knew that they were
[49:32] naked so from the very
[49:34] beginning Satan began to promise Eve
[49:38] something you don't think that Adam had
[49:43] wisdom he had the very Mind Of God why
[49:46] was it in the very beginning that Adam
[49:48] would begin to name the animals and God
[49:51] said that's exactly what I would call it
[49:53] that's what I would name it that's what
[49:55] I would do yeah right and he was God was
[49:59] going to express himself to Adam and Eve
[50:01] in such a way he was going to begin to
[50:03] unfold himself in a knowledge and in a
[50:06] wisdom for them to understand greater
[50:08] things but in that time Satan came
[50:17] in God's power to transform he says
[50:21] which it's all right to have wisdom but
[50:23] if the wisdom is contrary if the word
[50:26] wisdom isn't correct wisdom from God
[50:29] Divine wisdom and becomes natural wisdom
[50:32] I don't care how much science we have
[50:34] and what more and education it's of the
[50:42] devil he says civilization is of the
[50:45] devil he says all culture in the Earth
[50:47] all powers of Science and everything is
[50:50] of the devil it's his gospel he preached
[50:54] of knowledge in the Garden of Eden
[50:58] and he has took that knowledge and
[50:59] perverted not that perverted knowledge
[51:02] contrary to the word and will and plan
[51:04] of God and now he has had 6,000 years to
[51:08] do exactly what God did only in a
[51:11] perverted way yeah and took the same
[51:14] amount of time to bring his own Eden
[51:18] in isn't that
[51:20] something that satans had the same
[51:22] amount of time to do what God has done
[51:25] but only in a perb way and then like I
[51:27] say Satan can't create he has no power
[51:31] to create he can't give you the
[51:33] knowledge he can't give you wisdom but
[51:35] what he does is he takes man's the the
[51:38] Battle Ground of man in the mind and he
[51:40] begins to battle with your
[51:43] thoughts he begins to take that human
[51:46] reasoning that human
[51:48] wisdom and that's what he uses to battle
[51:51] against God's word he uses that to
[51:53] battle against God's wisdom right
[52:00] and now he's got an Eden here on Earth
[52:02] it's filled with wisdom and
[52:05] knowledge it's filled with wisdom and
[52:08] knowledge I'm going to throw this in
[52:12] here what are the first two of the
[52:15] spiritual gifts that God gave to the
[52:20] church wisdom and
[52:25] knowledge that was his gospel at the
[52:27] beginning knowledge science wisdom and
[52:31] science never did God ever cater to that
[52:34] I want you to watch a minute he did this
[52:38] because that he was a man of worldly
[52:42] wisdom you see it's not of a Heavenly
[52:45] wisdom it's Earthly it's Central it's
[52:47] devilish you say well Brother Jay How
[52:49] will I know the difference How will I
[52:51] know the difference of of a wisdom from
[52:54] God and man Earthly wisdom James 3 and13
[52:59] says who is W A wise man endued with
[53:01] knowledge among you let him show out of
[53:04] good conversation his works with
[53:06] meekness of
[53:08] wisdom but if ye have better envying and
[53:11] strife in your heart Glory not and lie
[53:13] not against the truth this
[53:16] wisdom descendeth not from above but is
[53:20] Earthly sensual and devilish that what
[53:24] were the effects of Satan's wisdom in
[53:26] the
[53:28] garden verse 16 for envying and strife
[53:32] there was
[53:33] confusion you see if a man has wisdom if
[53:37] a man has wisdom and there's confusion
[53:39] and there's
[53:40] Strife if there's things that don't make
[53:43] sense there's things that don't add
[53:45] up if a man ever gets behind the pulpit
[53:48] and he begins to share how can a man
[53:50] show or preach the love of God and not
[53:53] live the love of God on now all right
[53:56] yeah that's how can we as Believers say
[53:58] well I believe in grace and I do this
[54:00] and I believe but yet you don't show
[54:03] Grace you don't have
[54:07] mercy there's strife and
[54:09] envy there's battles between different
[54:12] ones how is that the Christlike
[54:20] character verse 17 but the wisdom that
[54:23] is from above is pure it's Peaceable
[54:26] it's gentle it's easy to be entreated
[54:29] full of
[54:34] Mercy good fruit without
[54:38] partiality without
[54:41] hypocrisy that's the wisdom that's from
[54:45] above that's why your your speech should
[54:48] be seasoned with
[54:49] salt when the wisdom that you're
[54:52] portraying maybe it's a situation that
[54:55] you have a conflict between Brothers a
[54:58] conflict between a loved one or a
[55:00] relative a conflict between somebody
[55:02] else in the church a conflict from
[55:04] church to
[55:06] church is our
[55:08] wisdom seasoned with salt is it
[55:11] Peaceable is it
[55:13] Meek is it
[55:17] humble without
[55:20] partiality I think that's a big one
[55:23] that's a hard
[55:25] one we're all
[55:27] humans we
[55:30] are we're all humans partiality is one
[55:33] of those things man it's
[55:36] hard because does not the Bible say if a
[55:39] man came and gave clothing and Rich and
[55:41] he had all these things and you said sit
[55:43] here and somebody of the less fortunate
[55:46] and you kick them to the
[55:47] back but let me ask you what if it's
[55:50] somebody of your own
[55:52] household not being partial to that
[55:54] person
[55:57] that's a tough
[56:03] one let us have wisdom that is from
[56:06] above full of
[56:09] Mercy you see it's easy to treat those
[56:12] with a wisdom and with a love that treat
[56:15] us the same
[56:17] way it's easy to have those ones that we
[56:20] see eye to eye with it's easy to wrap
[56:24] your arm around them
[56:27] it's easy to call them up hey buddy
[56:28] how's it going you want to come over for
[56:32] dinner why don't you call up somebody
[56:34] you disagree with invite them out to
[56:38] lunch we can test what kind of wisdom we
[56:42] have what kind of Christlike character
[56:45] we
[56:46] have listen Saints I believe this is
[56:48] your Bible I believe we got to live the
[56:50] scriptures it's more than just talking
[56:53] about it it's more than just oh I I'm a
[56:55] good Christian and I go on Sundays and
[56:57] Wednesdays and I serve God and I love
[57:00] God but where is The Life of Christ in
[57:01] our
[57:04] lives it's the simple things of a
[57:06] Christian
[57:08] walk sir I want us to be so close to God
[57:12] that the people out there in the world
[57:14] there's something different about the
[57:15] way you talk there's a difference in the
[57:17] way you treat
[57:19] me why is it that you're up against this
[57:22] coworker and you you go up and shake his
[57:24] hand even though you disagree
[57:28] right it's noticeable
[57:35] friends 1 Corinthians 1:1 19 says for it
[57:39] is written I will destroy the wisdom of
[57:41] the wise and will bring to nothing the
[57:43] understanding of The Prudent where is
[57:45] the wise where is the scribes where is
[57:48] the disputers of this world hath not God
[57:50] CH made the
[57:52] foolish the wisdom of this world for
[57:56] after that in the wisdom of God the
[57:58] World by wisdom knew not
[58:02] God it pleaseth God by the foolishness
[58:05] of preaching to save them yes sir that
[58:09] believe I'm so thankful it's the
[58:13] foolishness the foolishness of preaching
[58:16] why because if you ever if a man ever
[58:18] gets pupped up ever thinks that it's all
[58:20] about him ever think that he did
[58:22] anything let me tell you something we
[58:24] have nothing to do with it
[58:27] it's the foolishness of preaching but
[58:30] yet he still saves lives
[58:39] amen for after that in the wisdom of God
[58:42] the World by wisdom knew not God it
[58:45] pleased God by the foolishness of
[58:47] preaching to save them that believe for
[58:49] to the Jews required a sign and the
[58:52] Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach
[58:54] Christ crucified
[58:56] unto the Jews it was a stumbling block
[58:58] and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto
[59:01] them which are called how many are
[59:03] called this
[59:04] evening but them which are called the
[59:07] Greeks it
[59:10] says both Jews and Greeks Christ the
[59:13] power the power of God the wisdom of God
[59:16] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[59:18] than man and the weakness of God is
[59:21] stronger Hallelujah than man
[59:26] it's in our weakness God is made strong
[59:29] you see many times we get in trouble
[59:31] because we get too stronge headed we
[59:33] begin to think we know it all we can do
[59:35] it all we can do God this we can serve
[59:38] him this way we can handle this
[59:40] situation this way but yet we need the
[59:42] wisdom of God to come and discern the
[59:45] situation and to lead us and guide us
[59:47] into all truths
[59:51] amen that the weakness of God is
[59:55] stronger than man
[1:00:00] because the
[1:00:02] foolishness but God had chosen the
[1:00:04] foolish things of this world to confound
[1:00:07] the wise yes sir God hath chosen the
[1:00:10] weak things of this world to confound
[1:00:12] the things which are
[1:00:15] Mighty you see he works in what we would
[1:00:18] consider
[1:00:22] foolishness what God calls great man
[1:00:25] calls foolish
[1:00:30] right you see things we see so
[1:00:33] foolish and hard to understand yet God
[1:00:35] in his infant ways is
[1:00:38] working and we try to outsmart God and
[1:00:40] think it's our ways or are better than
[1:00:42] his and we try to outsmart
[1:00:45] him we tried to use the intellect of
[1:00:49] understanding we try to use AI to get
[1:00:54] by we try use
[1:00:59] Google sometimes we need to KN kneel on
[1:01:01] our prayer or kneel down on our knees
[1:01:05] and say a prayer rather than looking
[1:01:07] some up on the
[1:01:09] internet rather than asking AI what is
[1:01:12] this symptom what is that symptom what
[1:01:14] should I do you should kneel down and
[1:01:17] pray yes sir
[1:01:26] in 57 he says why is it
[1:01:29] so that so many Christians find it hard
[1:01:32] to live a Christian
[1:01:33] Life he says now notice if God intended
[1:01:37] the church to be run upon intellectuals
[1:01:39] then it doesn't take the Holy Spirit to
[1:01:41] do anything in that
[1:01:43] church he says we don't need the Holy
[1:01:46] Ghost if the church is run upon
[1:01:51] intellectuals then we find the smartest
[1:01:55] man we could find to be our pastor and
[1:01:58] the biggest buildings that we could
[1:01:59] build and the more members we could get
[1:02:01] into a church and root out the
[1:02:03] illiterate and bring in the
[1:02:05] intellectuals better the church would be
[1:02:07] if that's the program if that's the
[1:02:09] program the smarter the preacher the
[1:02:11] smarter the congregation the more
[1:02:13] intellectuals they are the better
[1:02:15] congregation it'll
[1:02:17] be thans of God that isn't the
[1:02:20] case if we ever get to the place that we
[1:02:24] pick the smartest man and we got to rule
[1:02:26] it and it's got to go this way many
[1:02:28] times we put our hands in it and we got
[1:02:29] to think that this isn't going to happen
[1:02:31] it's got to operate this way it becomes
[1:02:34] a program let me tell you none of this
[1:02:36] is
[1:02:38] rehearsed the music isn't
[1:02:41] rehearsed the song leading isn't
[1:02:42] rehearsed the preaching isn't
[1:02:44] rehearsed because we're dependent upon
[1:02:47] the leadership of the Holy Spirit and if
[1:02:49] we ever make it a program where it's got
[1:02:51] to be run this way and you got to do it
[1:02:53] this way and this person's got to sing
[1:02:55] and this person's got to leave and we
[1:02:57] got to have this person play the piano
[1:02:59] we're getting out of
[1:03:04] Step listen mistakes and things are
[1:03:06] going to
[1:03:07] happen mics are going to go out people
[1:03:10] are going to make a
[1:03:14] mistake and so many times we get caught
[1:03:16] up I'm guilty of it well the sound's not
[1:03:19] working and this guy's not working and
[1:03:22] why isn't the video and this and that
[1:03:23] you got all these problems
[1:03:26] what do you think Satan's
[1:03:29] doing he's working he's working he got
[1:03:32] you right where he wants you running
[1:03:34] around the church during service trying
[1:03:36] to fix it I've been
[1:03:40] there listen things happen because it's
[1:03:43] not a
[1:03:49] production brother brandom says but I
[1:03:52] can't find one place in all the holy
[1:03:53] scriptures where God's church is to be
[1:03:55] run upon the wisdom of man and as long
[1:03:58] as we try to run it upon intellectual
[1:04:01] man the intellectual man we are
[1:04:04] absolutely fighting the
[1:04:08] air God's church is to be run upon the B
[1:04:11] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit then
[1:04:14] if we have the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:17] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is going to
[1:04:19] run the
[1:04:20] church then it doesn't take too much
[1:04:24] intellect Hallelujah I'm so thankful
[1:04:26] he's not dependent upon my intellect I'm
[1:04:29] not I'm so glad he's not thankful or
[1:04:31] dependent upon how much I know to
[1:04:35] minister because I wouldn't be up
[1:04:39] here listen he's dependent upon the holy
[1:04:42] spirit and that Holy Spirit he says then
[1:04:45] if we have the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:47] Spirit what is it the holy spirit in you
[1:04:51] that's
[1:04:53] operating each one of you have a job to
[1:04:55] do because the holy spirit is going to
[1:04:57] work in different ways listen I think
[1:05:00] one way Jonathan thinks another we both
[1:05:02] have the Holy Spirit and sometimes we
[1:05:05] get into a place maybe you know that's
[1:05:07] why a church isn't a dictatorship it's
[1:05:09] not run off of one
[1:05:12] man that's why he has a board and those
[1:05:14] boards have that the board the people on
[1:05:16] the board have a
[1:05:18] voice
[1:05:20] right listen it's not dependent upon
[1:05:23] them but it's the holy spirit in them
[1:05:26] God uses different backgrounds different
[1:05:28] ethnicities different raisings yes to
[1:05:32] bring different
[1:05:35] viewpoints he
[1:05:39] does that's why a church he has a
[1:05:42] board I was even listening the other day
[1:05:45] and it came
[1:05:47] up and he was talking about you know
[1:05:50] brother Brandon was saying you know men
[1:05:52] on my board I I I want them to say this
[1:05:54] or I don't want them to just cater to me
[1:05:58] right because if they cater to me and
[1:06:00] they want to want to say things that I
[1:06:02] you know I want them to hear it will do
[1:06:04] no
[1:06:05] good if they don't voice an opinion it
[1:06:08] doesn't do no
[1:06:10] good but yet it's the leadership of the
[1:06:12] Holy Spirit listen it's the leadership
[1:06:15] of the Holy Spirit In You amen that's
[1:06:21] right it takes away the
[1:06:24] intellectual it doesn't take education
[1:06:27] it takes the Holy Spirit that's God's
[1:06:30] program amen that's God's
[1:06:37] program you see we got to start trusting
[1:06:39] in the wisdom of the holy spirit that
[1:06:41] God placed inside of us and you might be
[1:06:44] thinking I'm just going to throw the
[1:06:45] disclaimer out there you might be
[1:06:46] thinking I'm talking about our board
[1:06:48] I've never sat in our board meeting I
[1:06:49] don't know what goes on so if that's for
[1:06:52] somebody out I don't know what
[1:06:54] yeah I'm not discrediting anybody I'm
[1:06:59] not got to throw that out there never
[1:07:01] sat in the meeting I don't know what
[1:07:03] goes
[1:07:05] on but you see we get so worked up in
[1:07:08] ways we begin to try to figure things
[1:07:10] out I know people that sat around on on
[1:07:14] Election night and they begin they would
[1:07:15] stay up to 2: 4 in the morning they
[1:07:17] asked me did you stay up no I went to
[1:07:19] bed listen whoever's going to be
[1:07:21] president is going to be
[1:07:22] president listen God has it in his plan
[1:07:26] it don't matter if I voted didn't vote
[1:07:28] who voted let let me tell you God is
[1:07:30] going to have his man in
[1:07:32] office so why get worked up why get
[1:07:35] worried about it that's right because
[1:07:37] Daniel says in uh Daniel 2 he says
[1:07:40] Daniel answered and said bless blessed
[1:07:43] be the the name of God forever and ever
[1:07:45] for wisdom and might are his and he
[1:07:48] changes the times and the seasons he
[1:07:50] removeth Kings and Seth up Kings he puts
[1:07:54] presidents in and he takes president's
[1:07:56] out he puts this person in office and he
[1:07:58] takes this person out it's all in God's
[1:08:02] plan yes so there's no need to get
[1:08:05] worried and worked up over things that
[1:08:08] you can't
[1:08:12] control yes sir you know in sports they
[1:08:14] always tell you do your
[1:08:17] job don't worry about the other person
[1:08:20] because if you're worried about the
[1:08:22] other person to do their job you'll miss
[1:08:24] your assignment am but if everybody is
[1:08:26] focused on their walk if everybody's
[1:08:29] focused on their goal and saying Lord I
[1:08:31] want to be the best version of myself I
[1:08:33] want to strive to be the best Christian
[1:08:35] I want to serve you with a fervency I
[1:08:37] want to be faithful in
[1:08:40] church everybody's going to be all
[1:08:45] right he removeth Kings and puts Kings
[1:08:48] in he giveth wisdom unto the wise and
[1:08:51] knowledge unto them that know
[1:08:53] understanding he revealeth the Deep and
[1:08:55] secret things he knoweth what is in the
[1:08:58] darkness and the light dwelleth in him
[1:09:02] he says I thank thee and praise thee Oh
[1:09:05] thy God of my fathers who hath given me
[1:09:08] wisdom and might and H has made known
[1:09:12] unto me
[1:09:14] now has made known unto me now what we
[1:09:19] desire of thee you see God comes and he
[1:09:22] makes it known unto you what you should
[1:09:24] desire of
[1:09:27] him for thou Hast not now made me known
[1:09:31] unto us the Kings
[1:09:35] matter is made known unto us the Kings
[1:09:40] matter we want to be about our father's
[1:09:42] business we want to be about the king's
[1:09:49] matter and there was a story in the
[1:09:53] Bible where a little
[1:09:56] Queen came from an AR a far off country
[1:10:00] and she heard of the wisdom of a man and
[1:10:03] she came to see who what this was all
[1:10:05] about she began to have people come to
[1:10:07] her City and they would say there was a
[1:10:09] man that discerned this and he he he
[1:10:11] spoke over me on this and he began to
[1:10:13] you know heal this or do these these
[1:10:16] things of God and this Pagan this Pagan
[1:10:19] Queen be to desire she began to seek
[1:10:22] after she began to wonder what was this
[1:10:24] all about
[1:10:27] out and she heard that this man was
[1:10:29] given a gift from
[1:10:31] God and the people made him King and
[1:10:34] brother brandom says when God sends a
[1:10:36] gift to the people they better heed to
[1:10:38] that gift they better take note of that
[1:10:41] gift you better find out what that
[1:10:43] gift's all
[1:10:44] about that's good because there's an
[1:10:47] important thing that's going to
[1:10:51] happen and so this this queen desired
[1:10:56] and wondered about this this
[1:10:58] man and she began to think within her
[1:11:01] heart if he can discern the heart of
[1:11:03] them what could he do for
[1:11:07] me is his wisdom cracked up to be all
[1:11:11] that is it
[1:11:15] true and this woman would travel this
[1:11:18] queen would travel for three months the
[1:11:22] Bible says for 90 days on camels she
[1:11:24] would bring all all that she had and she
[1:11:27] would come across desert places and
[1:11:29] brother Brandon would dramatize and he
[1:11:31] would say they would travel at night
[1:11:32] because it was so hot across them
[1:11:34] deserts and they would travel from a far
[1:11:37] off and they would go long hours on the
[1:11:39] backs of these
[1:11:40] camels and he says a shame to
[1:11:44] America because we can't even she didn't
[1:11:47] have a an air conditioned Cadillac she
[1:11:49] didn't have an airplane to travel in she
[1:11:51] didn't have some comfort
[1:11:56] but she came because she had such a
[1:11:58] desire and a fervency to meet this gift
[1:12:01] to see this man
[1:12:04] amen and the Bible tells us that in
[1:12:07] Matthew 12 that the queen of the South
[1:12:09] shall rise up in the day of judgment
[1:12:12] with this generation and shall condemn
[1:12:14] it for she came from the uttermost parts
[1:12:16] of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[1:12:19] Solomon Behold a greater than Solomon is
[1:12:23] here amen yes she came from the
[1:12:26] uttermost parts he says this queen is
[1:12:28] going to rise up in the day of judgment
[1:12:30] why because people failed to cross the
[1:12:33] street and go and see what it was all
[1:12:36] about he says shame on us we can't even
[1:12:38] get the people to come on a Wednesday
[1:12:41] shame because they won't even cross the
[1:12:43] street to go see what this message is
[1:12:45] all about he says she'll rise up in the
[1:12:48] day of judgment and judge sir
[1:12:57] every time you I was listening to
[1:12:59] several of the sermons of greater than
[1:13:01] Solomon and brother Brandon would always
[1:13:03] say of the places that he was at he says
[1:13:05] you know Houston Texas God's going to
[1:13:07] judge you for
[1:13:09] it Phoenix Arizona God's going to judge
[1:13:11] you for it United States he's going to
[1:13:14] judge she's going to judge you for
[1:13:17] it because they
[1:13:19] failed to see what it was all about
[1:13:28] you see God's given a gift in our day
[1:13:31] he's given us a message yes sir it's not
[1:13:34] my message it's his message and when God
[1:13:37] sends a gift let's take note of what
[1:13:39] that that gift's all about the gift
[1:13:41] might be off the scene but let me tell
[1:13:42] you something the message Never Dies why
[1:13:45] because it's his
[1:13:50] word and God is still giving us an
[1:13:53] opportunity to heed to the wisdom wiom
[1:13:55] that he
[1:13:57] gave don't miss those
[1:14:00] opportunities don't take those
[1:14:01] opportunities
[1:14:03] lightly there's a story that comes to my
[1:14:06] mind of a man he was out in the ocean
[1:14:08] and he was out there and his boat began
[1:14:10] to
[1:14:12] sink his boat began to sink and he began
[1:14:15] to pray unto God and he said God would
[1:14:17] you come and save
[1:14:20] me and a big boat came coming down down
[1:14:23] the ways and he sat there and he says
[1:14:26] well if God sent them they'll come right
[1:14:28] to me the boat went
[1:14:30] on and then an airplane flew over his
[1:14:33] head and he didn't flag it down he says
[1:14:35] well if they seen me they'll send
[1:14:37] somebody well the weeks went on and he
[1:14:40] drowned when we got up to heaven he
[1:14:42] asked God well why didn't you save me I
[1:14:44] prayed I asked why didn't you come he
[1:14:47] says I sent you a boat and I sent you an
[1:14:49] airplane and you just sat
[1:14:53] there right on
[1:14:56] God has offered us the wisdom of
[1:14:57] almighty God he's offered us the
[1:14:59] blessings of his
[1:15:01] word help us to reach out and grab those
[1:15:04] blessings don't let us miss an
[1:15:10] opportunity let's read the story in 2
[1:15:19] chonicles and when the queen of the of
[1:15:22] Sheba heard the fame of Solomon she came
[1:15:24] to prove solemn and with hard questions
[1:15:27] at
[1:15:28] Jerusalem and with a very great company
[1:15:31] of camels that bear spices gold in
[1:15:34] abundance precious
[1:15:35] stones you see she was bringing her
[1:15:39] gifts think spiritually here she was
[1:15:42] bringing her gifts she came to prove to
[1:15:46] see if this message is all is it all is
[1:15:49] it all that is it
[1:15:51] true and when she came to Solomon she
[1:15:54] Comm commun with him of all that was in
[1:15:57] her
[1:15:59] heart and Solomon told her all her
[1:16:01] questions and there was nothing hid from
[1:16:04] Solomon which he had told her not and
[1:16:07] when the Queen of Sheba had seen the
[1:16:09] wisdom of Solomon then the house that he
[1:16:13] built now this house that he built it's
[1:16:16] not his natural house it's the house of
[1:16:20] God and Solomon this house that he built
[1:16:24] he had it in order
[1:16:28] he had it set in order nothing was out
[1:16:30] of
[1:16:33] order in verse four and the
[1:16:36] meat of his
[1:16:38] table and the setting of his servants
[1:16:41] and the attendants of his ministers in
[1:16:43] their per perel and his cup bearers also
[1:16:45] in their perel and his descent by which
[1:16:48] he went up into the house of the Lord
[1:16:50] and there was no more spirit in her now
[1:16:52] I want you to understand we're going to
[1:16:54] break this down because it began to come
[1:16:56] to me that it says the meat of his table
[1:16:58] you see around the king's table it's not
[1:17:01] it's not just the sincere milk of the
[1:17:03] word but meat are those that are of full
[1:17:06] age those that can handle
[1:17:09] it it's the meat of his
[1:17:12] table let me tell you if we're having
[1:17:15] steak night night at my house and my
[1:17:18] sons are past you know one of them
[1:17:19] drinks milk but the other one we still
[1:17:22] give them meat but let me tell you
[1:17:25] God's going to feed his children the
[1:17:27] meat of the word and it's time to grow
[1:17:30] up it's time to
[1:17:31] mature let me tell you we're getting
[1:17:33] close it's time to get into this word
[1:17:37] it's time to eat the book
[1:17:39] amen listen we all eat at different
[1:17:42] Paces I'm a slow
[1:17:44] eater but let me tell you my bite of
[1:17:47] steak is a lot different than Nolan's
[1:17:48] bite of steak and that's what God does
[1:17:51] spiritually he doesn't come and say all
[1:17:53] right here son here you you go and here
[1:17:55] you go and we all get that same bite
[1:17:57] because some of us would choke over it
[1:17:59] come on you understanding but what he
[1:18:02] does he says okay son here he cuts it a
[1:18:04] little smaller now chew on this chew on
[1:18:07] this a little bit all right son I know
[1:18:09] you need a little bit more wisdom listen
[1:18:11] don't be discouraged if you don't
[1:18:13] understand it all don't don't get
[1:18:15] discouraged if you can't put this type
[1:18:17] and that type
[1:18:19] right you know what he'll do he just
[1:18:21] cuts the steak a little smaller chew it
[1:18:24] a little yeah do a little more oh
[1:18:26] there's somebody choking in the back
[1:18:27] that's all right let's cut it up a
[1:18:29] little
[1:18:30] smaller just keep
[1:18:32] chewing Che
[1:18:35] amen it's the meat of his
[1:18:38] table and the sitting of his servants
[1:18:40] and the attendants of his ministers and
[1:18:42] there a pair and the cup bears and and
[1:18:45] the people that he that he says here I
[1:18:47] noticed that all the positions are
[1:18:49] positions of
[1:18:51] servitude if you want to be a part of go
[1:18:54] the King's house house you're going to
[1:18:55] have to learn to
[1:18:56] serve amen you're going to have to learn
[1:18:59] to serve you say well I'm not a minister
[1:19:02] that's all right then be a then be a
[1:19:04] servant if you can't be a servant be a
[1:19:06] cup Bearer how many brought their cups
[1:19:08] this evening and say Lift It Up Lord I
[1:19:11] lift my cup up fill it
[1:19:16] up and when it begins to overflow the
[1:19:19] thing with the cup Bearer when that cup
[1:19:21] begins to overflow you know what they
[1:19:22] were doing they were serving others
[1:19:25] yeah amen you know what the the cup
[1:19:27] bearers were supposed to do make sure
[1:19:28] that it was the King's Wine to make sure
[1:19:31] that's what he wanted to serve to make
[1:19:33] sure it was good enough you know what El
[1:19:34] it was to make sure it wasn't
[1:19:39] poisoned yeah good so you know what you
[1:19:41] need to do when you come to church you
[1:19:43] bring your cup and you say Lord fill it
[1:19:45] up let me serve somebody else let me
[1:19:47] pour if it begins to flow over brother
[1:19:49] Brian let me pour up into your cup and
[1:19:51] it flows over over here to brother Theo
[1:19:53] and it goes on and on why because we're
[1:19:56] here to serve one
[1:19:58] another and when somebody begins to get
[1:20:01] a little dry that may maybe they're a
[1:20:03] little empty on their cup you need to go
[1:20:05] over there and refill
[1:20:07] them give them the wine of the Holy
[1:20:10] Spirit it'll add a little stimulation to
[1:20:12] their life it'll add a little quickening
[1:20:15] power to their life
[1:20:27] I have to say this because it I see it
[1:20:29] in my notes because it was something
[1:20:31] that came up and it was just you know
[1:20:34] the term the meat of the word it just
[1:20:36] popped up when I went to copy the
[1:20:37] scripture into the notes it popped up in
[1:20:40] like this footnote and it says the term
[1:20:42] the meat of the word refers to an idea
[1:20:45] that knowledge and wisdom from the Bible
[1:20:47] is only useful if it's put into
[1:20:52] practice you can have the meat of the
[1:20:54] word but is it put into
[1:21:02] practice and we see here
[1:21:07] that the attendance of their Min of the
[1:21:10] ministers and the cup bearers and their
[1:21:13] apparel he mentions apparel twice so
[1:21:16] you're telling me it's important on the
[1:21:18] way you dress you're telling me there's
[1:21:20] a there there's a there there's a
[1:21:22] approach there's a way that we must
[1:21:25] dress that we must Dawn ourselves
[1:21:30] with and the ascent by which you went up
[1:21:33] into the house of the
[1:21:35] Lord how do you approach Church you're
[1:21:38] telling me there's a right way to
[1:21:40] approach
[1:21:41] church amen does this sound familiar
[1:21:43] this is Solomon and yet we had a man in
[1:21:45] our day that came and when he begin to
[1:21:48] put the church in
[1:21:51] order I don't want to get ahead of
[1:21:53] myself but he begin to put the church in
[1:21:57] order and tell us there's a way to
[1:22:00] dress there's a way to come to church 30
[1:22:03] minutes early soften your
[1:22:12] heart you see according to man's Wisdom
[1:22:14] it may seem in insignificant on our
[1:22:17] Peril you're saying that's a big deal
[1:22:20] well if the prophet said it if it's in
[1:22:22] the scripture if it's the the order in
[1:22:25] which Solomon did
[1:22:28] it in verse 5 and she said to the king
[1:22:31] it was a true report which I heard in my
[1:22:34] own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom
[1:22:37] how be it I believe not their words
[1:22:40] until I came and mine eyes had seen you
[1:22:44] see sometimes you have to come and see
[1:22:46] for yourself you can see that God did
[1:22:48] something for your mom God did something
[1:22:50] for your dad he might have done somebody
[1:22:52] else he might have healed somebody else
[1:22:54] but you got to come and see for
[1:23:02] yourself and behold one half of the
[1:23:04] greatness of thy wisdom was not told
[1:23:07] unto me isn't that
[1:23:11] something that one half of the wisdom
[1:23:13] wasn't told that's what happens
[1:23:15] sometimes we only hear half the
[1:23:20] story we only hear half the story as the
[1:23:24] same goes there's always two sides to
[1:23:26] the story don't always believe what you
[1:23:28] hear sometimes we begin to believe
[1:23:31] certain things that are said about this
[1:23:32] person or said that about that person
[1:23:34] but we fail to go get the other half of
[1:23:36] the
[1:23:40] story you see if somebody wants to lead
[1:23:43] you off into some kind of Doctrine if
[1:23:45] they want to take you out into you know
[1:23:47] tapes only well why aren't they telling
[1:23:48] you the other half of the
[1:23:51] story why aren't they reading the rest
[1:23:53] of the scripture why aren't they reading
[1:23:55] the rest of the quotes that contradict
[1:23:57] the way that they
[1:24:00] believe because when you take the full
[1:24:02] word of God there's no in
[1:24:05] between his word is his word right but
[1:24:09] where we get in trouble and men get in
[1:24:11] trouble is they begin to take scriptures
[1:24:13] that they like and don't like and they
[1:24:15] begin to divide it this way or that way
[1:24:17] and pull one off but yet you're not
[1:24:19] taking the other side of the wisdom of
[1:24:22] almighty God
[1:24:27] right she had to come and see just like
[1:24:31] philli told Nathaniel we have found the
[1:24:33] one that Moses spoke of and he says who
[1:24:37] is he he's from Nazareth he says nothing
[1:24:40] could come come out of
[1:24:42] Nazareth he says come and
[1:24:45] see listen you don't got to convince
[1:24:47] everybody right you don't got to tell
[1:24:49] everybody the whole spill of everything
[1:24:52] just tell them come and see there's guys
[1:24:54] that I've been working on for years and
[1:24:56] I talk to them and I wait and I don't do
[1:24:58] it every time and I'm not forceful on
[1:25:01] but I'm just waiting and waiting when
[1:25:03] they open up an opportunity they say man
[1:25:05] I'm having a hard time hey I got a
[1:25:06] solution hey I got something that might
[1:25:08] encourage you hey show up on a Wednesday
[1:25:10] night hey come over here listen I don't
[1:25:13] need to pound him all the time with this
[1:25:15] is that and this is the prophet you
[1:25:17] better see it no no no that's not the
[1:25:19] way that's not an attraction of people
[1:25:21] that's not how to get them that's not
[1:25:23] how to witness
[1:25:25] listen you bring him to church and just
[1:25:27] say come and
[1:25:28] see why do you act the way you do come
[1:25:30] and see why do you dress the way you do
[1:25:33] come and
[1:25:35] see because let me tell you you get them
[1:25:38] to church and they come into a church
[1:25:42] and they have respect for you and they
[1:25:43] walk away and they say it wasn't for me
[1:25:45] that's fine that's good yeah because
[1:25:49] they'll be judged on what they
[1:25:51] know right that's what he said they'll
[1:25:53] be judged by what they
[1:25:57] know you did your
[1:26:04] part verse 7 says happy are thy men and
[1:26:07] happy are thy servants which stand
[1:26:09] continually before thee and hear thy
[1:26:14] wisdom happy are
[1:26:17] they you should be the happiest people
[1:26:20] of the
[1:26:22] earth you should be happy in the Lord no
[1:26:24] matter what the circumstance that you're
[1:26:26] going through no matter the sickness no
[1:26:28] matter the trial no matter where you're
[1:26:30] at
[1:26:31] financially no matter what the case is
[1:26:33] you should be the happiest the Most
[1:26:35] Blessed people on the face of the Earth
[1:26:37] why because they sent greater than
[1:26:40] Solomon is here
[1:26:42] amen and we had a man with a gift that
[1:26:45] came in our day and he would begin to
[1:26:46] discern the hearts of the people and he
[1:26:48] would begin to to to to do healings and
[1:26:52] the discernment of hand or you
[1:26:54] discernment of hearts and the healing in
[1:26:57] the hand and people thrived over it they
[1:26:59] loved him for
[1:27:01] it the first and second pull it begin to
[1:27:04] pull people into it and everybody began
[1:27:07] to come from their denominations they
[1:27:09] begin to come and see they begin to
[1:27:10] bring their gifts into the
[1:27:16] body but yet when the prophet begin to
[1:27:19] put things in
[1:27:21] order when he stepped into his ministry
[1:27:24] when he began to step into that third
[1:27:26] pole it's not for
[1:27:29] everybody where did the multitudes go
[1:27:32] right a man that would travel around the
[1:27:34] world what does he say seven times over
[1:27:36] or several times over whatever it was
[1:27:39] and he would travel the world and and do
[1:27:41] all these healing campaigns and
[1:27:42] everybody wanted to him at their
[1:27:44] conventions and they wanted him to
[1:27:46] preach it and do healings and all that
[1:27:50] but whenever he began to set the church
[1:27:52] in order when he begin to have church
[1:27:54] order and hey those gifts we got to
[1:27:57] handle them this way hey I want you your
[1:27:58] approach to church I need you 30 minutes
[1:28:00] early I want there's a dress
[1:28:02] code he begin to preach at the women
[1:28:05] what
[1:28:06] happened they wanted the gifts they
[1:28:08] wanted all those Sensations but they
[1:28:10] didn't want the real wisdom of almighty
[1:28:19] God they all brought their gifts from
[1:28:21] denominations begin to operate they love
[1:28:25] the healings the signs the
[1:28:27] Wonders people do in every age but yet
[1:28:31] there's a
[1:28:38] separation I said in the beginning what
[1:28:40] was the
[1:28:43] two spiritual gifts that Satan used in
[1:28:46] the beginning what were them man what
[1:28:48] are the first two can you pull that up
[1:28:51] if you have
[1:28:52] it wisdom and
[1:28:56] knowledge wisdom and
[1:29:00] knowledge what's the bridge between
[1:29:02] those two of the remaining
[1:29:04] six Faith so Satan knew that if he can
[1:29:08] mess with wisdom and
[1:29:10] knowledge discredit discredit your
[1:29:14] faith he would make the church
[1:29:16] powerless he'd begin to take away the
[1:29:19] healings and the Miracles the prophecies
[1:29:28] people love the feeling of the outward
[1:29:32] gifts people desire the outward Gifts of
[1:29:35] those that are four through nine because
[1:29:38] they feel good on our
[1:29:40] flesh the healings the prophecies the
[1:29:43] speaking in tongues I can be honest with
[1:29:45] you and say I've never spoken
[1:29:48] tongues what I desire
[1:29:52] absolutely but yet maybe that's not the
[1:29:54] gift God has for
[1:29:56] me but yet what Satan tries to do is he
[1:29:59] tries to come at the first two we're
[1:30:01] going to read it here the prophet says
[1:30:03] and he he him he says do you know God
[1:30:06] never made two men the same there's no
[1:30:08] two of you in the world or ever has been
[1:30:11] that's got the th the same thumb
[1:30:14] print God makes men differently he has
[1:30:17] diversity of gifts and sends them into
[1:30:19] the church but we just cramp down on one
[1:30:22] and there you go and you see you don't
[1:30:24] get the wisdom of the spirit that's the
[1:30:27] reason God can't place us into the
[1:30:30] position where we should be in his
[1:30:36] body for one is given this sort of gift
[1:30:38] and the other this sort of gift and the
[1:30:40] other and the other this sort of gift
[1:30:42] and so forth but all to the same body
[1:30:45] but we want to be exactly like the other
[1:30:48] you can't do that amen you must use the
[1:30:52] wisdom of the word amen you must use the
[1:30:59] wisdom of the word like the Queen of
[1:31:02] Sheba everybody wants to come in and
[1:31:04] they came they came to see the
[1:31:06] gift the prophet in
[1:31:09] action they love the
[1:31:12] healings and as I said when the prophet
[1:31:15] began to put it in order they didn't
[1:31:18] want no part with it he sat down in
[1:31:20] Tucson without an invitation
[1:31:25] why because they like the other
[1:31:29] stuff they like to feel
[1:31:31] good I say God I want it all listen I'm
[1:31:35] not discrediting the
[1:31:36] rest I'm not discrediting the rest
[1:31:39] listen we need it it needs to operate
[1:31:41] within the church within the Assembly of
[1:31:43] God we need all the spiritual gifts
[1:31:46] yes but yet brother brother bradam
[1:31:51] says here and I will restore he says now
[1:31:54] you'll notice the routine of gifts the
[1:31:56] first is a gift of wisdom he says the
[1:31:59] gift the first is the gift of wisdom
[1:32:01] that is the best gift of the
[1:32:03] group he says if we don't got wisdom we
[1:32:06] don't know how to use knowledge it's the
[1:32:09] second gift and if we can't use the
[1:32:12] second gift without wisdom how are we
[1:32:14] going to use the last gift of
[1:32:16] interpretation and next to the last
[1:32:18] speaking in tongues he says our Zeal is
[1:32:20] eat up our wisdom our Zeal for our denom
[1:32:24] ations and our enthusiasm has eaten up
[1:32:26] the wisdom off the vine brotherly
[1:32:30] love my
[1:32:34] goodness our Zeal has eat up all our
[1:32:37] wisdom listen it's good to have Zeal we
[1:32:40] need ones with Zeal but you got to have
[1:32:42] wisdom that goes with
[1:32:44] iten wisdom and knowledge lets us know
[1:32:47] how to operate the
[1:32:49] gifts in the order of the gifts and
[1:32:53] Faith Comes comes in and gives us the
[1:32:55] the the faith to believe in
[1:33:01] him Zeal is a powerful
[1:33:03] thing but it has its
[1:33:10] place musicians come like I said the
[1:33:13] Queen of
[1:33:15] Sheba as we read in the Bible she came
[1:33:17] searching for a one with a gift and we
[1:33:20] can say this evening that we have found
[1:33:22] the one for our day that came with a
[1:33:24] gift that nobody spake like this no like
[1:33:28] this
[1:33:29] man no one had the discernment like this
[1:33:35] man we have found the message for this
[1:33:40] day and we know it's not the message of
[1:33:42] a man but it's the message of almighty
[1:33:49] God it's the very thoughts of God
[1:33:54] but yet can I say this that a greater
[1:33:56] than Solomon is here a greater than
[1:33:59] William brandham is here we have Jesus
[1:34:03] Christ himself the resurrected Lord
[1:34:05] Jesus Is Right amongst us walking
[1:34:07] Discerning the hearts ministering to
[1:34:09] lives Healing The Sick doing things that
[1:34:12] we don't even know what's happening
[1:34:13] right
[1:34:15] now but it's in his presence that he
[1:34:18] comes by and he ministers to lives he
[1:34:20] touches
[1:34:22] Hearts you might not not think coming on
[1:34:24] a Wednesday night you might not think ah
[1:34:26] it's just a Wednesday but let me tell
[1:34:28] you it does more than what you
[1:34:31] think it gives you a little bit of a
[1:34:33] boost
[1:35:05] when I look across the
[1:35:12] congregation you become
[1:35:16] humbled because you made an
[1:35:18] effort to come to the house of
[1:35:21] God and I believe God honors that
[1:35:30] yes I'm guilty of it maybe sometimes we
[1:35:33] get a little cold we get a little
[1:35:38] hard we get a little
[1:35:48] short we don't handle the situation
[1:35:51] correctly
[1:35:55] I say God give us
[1:35:57] wisdom I need more of
[1:36:05] wisdom you know I'm the type
[1:36:15] that you got to figure it all
[1:36:20] out you got to make it make sense
[1:36:30] sometimes things happen in certain ways
[1:36:32] and you're just
[1:36:34] like and you try to put God in a
[1:36:37] box you're trying to make it work this
[1:36:41] way on
[1:36:57] you know when you handle a situation
[1:37:02] wrongly it takes a real person to Humble
[1:37:05] themselves and say I'm
[1:37:08] sorry brother
[1:37:11] listen just because we stand behind our
[1:37:14] the pulpit doesn't mean we're perfect
[1:37:16] doesn't mean we don't make mistakes
[1:37:23] I can say each one of us would say Lord
[1:37:26] help us do better give us more wisdom
[1:37:28] give us more
[1:37:32] grace help us understand the certain
[1:37:37] situations many times we miss the big
[1:37:40] picture because we're so focused on
[1:37:44] something totally
[1:37:45] different but when you take your
[1:37:47] blinders off and you begin to see and
[1:37:49] maybe time goes on and the situation
[1:37:52] resolves itself you're like yes sir I
[1:38:09] understand and he he him he says what
[1:38:13] did Jesus represent he says Moses the
[1:38:16] law Elijah his sternness his
[1:38:20] Justice what did Jesus represent
[1:38:24] let me ask you what do you
[1:38:32] represent it says his
[1:38:36] love and what and when God being love
[1:38:41] and even so love the world and when the
[1:38:43] Divine love is projected it produces its
[1:38:48] subjects God could do nothing else but
[1:38:50] send something to take care take the
[1:38:53] place place of his love so the law
[1:38:55] couldn't do it his Justice couldn't do
[1:38:57] it so love took its
[1:39:03] place love God's love yes sir it'll take
[1:39:06] the place of speaking in tongues and
[1:39:09] that's all right it'll take the place of
[1:39:12] gifts of Wonders and signs and
[1:39:14] everything
[1:39:15] else if you haven't got love to
[1:39:17] accompany that what good does the signs
[1:39:19] do you
[1:39:25] God's tried to do it across the nation
[1:39:28] but it wouldn't
[1:39:29] work the greatest gift of all the gifts
[1:39:33] the greatest of all the gifts is wisdom
[1:39:35] and the second is
[1:39:37] knowledge if you haven't got knowledge
[1:39:40] you haven't got wisdom how can you
[1:39:42] control your
[1:39:43] knowledge what Good's your knowledge
[1:39:46] going to do see what I mean seek the
[1:39:48] first things first
[1:39:54] he says God keeping his word he says the
[1:39:56] first gift in the line the gifts is
[1:39:59] wisdom and the second is
[1:40:02] knowledge and if you don't have any
[1:40:04] wisdom how do you know what to do with
[1:40:06] knowledge seek the best things first
[1:40:12] wisdom if you ain't got wisdom what can
[1:40:15] you do with knowledge and speaking
[1:40:17] tongues and those others it takes wisdom
[1:40:19] it takes God's wisdom
[1:40:24] you know Saints I I may never speak in
[1:40:26] tongues I may never do those
[1:40:29] gifts but I say Lord give me wisdom that
[1:40:33] if a man in the Bible if King Solomon
[1:40:36] could pray for the gift of wisdom and
[1:40:38] God honor that how much more are we
[1:40:41] obligated to his word that when we begin
[1:40:44] to cry out we begin to ask we begin to
[1:40:47] apply our heart and say God give me
[1:40:50] wisdom give me knowledge let me know
[1:40:52] your word let me know how to discern let
[1:40:54] me know how to
[1:41:01] understand he says that's the most
[1:41:03] important gift is
[1:41:06] wisdom Proverbs
[1:41:09] 4:7 we read it wisdom is the principal
[1:41:13] thing therefore get wisdom and with all
[1:41:16] thy getting get
[1:41:21] understanding you see God's
[1:41:23] going to use another elect
[1:41:27] lady he has an elect lady on this
[1:41:31] earth that is going through hard times
[1:41:34] going through trials making mistakes
[1:41:36] you're going to make
[1:41:38] mistakes but get back up but he's using
[1:41:41] this this elect lady who's not
[1:41:45] perfect but yet one day just as the
[1:41:48] queen of the South is going to judge
[1:41:50] those he's going to use an elect lady
[1:41:54] an elect of God to come and
[1:41:57] choose and she's going to judge the
[1:42:01] earth and the wide of his hair is W of
[1:42:04] wool what is it the wisdom of almighty
[1:42:07] God he's going to judge the
[1:42:09] Earth let me ask you what kind of wisdom
[1:42:12] are you going to judge
[1:42:19] with you know when we get there
[1:42:24] and people come before
[1:42:27] us I've had many of people if go if the
[1:42:30] prophet could say for a glass of water
[1:42:33] you can give somebody eternal life maybe
[1:42:36] I'm the only one and I have people come
[1:42:38] and they do something nice for me I
[1:42:40] always tell make a mental note I say to
[1:42:42] myself Lord let me remember them let me
[1:42:45] remember
[1:42:47] them and I believe that at that judgment
[1:42:50] seat don't get me wrong there's going to
[1:42:51] be those that didn't live the right life
[1:42:56] didn't do the right
[1:42:58] things but I believe that heaven is
[1:43:00] going to be so
[1:43:02] big that I'll be able to judge with the
[1:43:07] wisdom man they may have smoked me
[1:43:12] once but maybe I reached around and they
[1:43:15] came and apologized and they did
[1:43:17] something for
[1:43:19] me Lord Give Me That kind of wisdom amen
[1:43:23] not only when I get to that judgment
[1:43:24] seat but
[1:43:28] now sometimes we handle situations and
[1:43:31] we we we blow off the
[1:43:36] cuff maybe that person had a relative
[1:43:38] that died maybe they had something that
[1:43:40] didn't go through maybe they don't have
[1:43:42] uh money in the bank and they're
[1:43:44] stressed at all
[1:43:45] high that's right we don't know the
[1:43:48] situation of every person I don't know
[1:43:51] the things you're going through but God
[1:43:57] does let's stand to our
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:07] feet what judgment will you
[1:44:12] use I know the Judgment I want to use is
[1:44:14] one of wisdom one of love one of
[1:44:18] compassion judge with a little more
[1:44:20] grace
