[51:47] of God in the last dayen that for there
[51:50] will be many that will hear the
[51:54] articulation of the voice but will not
[51:57] catch the
[51:58] understanding that's why Jesus
[52:02] said why is it you don't understand my
[52:06] speech because I speak plainly to you so
[52:11] though the Bible is here and though we
[52:14] can read it and we understand its

[52:32] God to Quicken the word of God to us
[52:36] that we might know amen because how can
[52:39] we serve a God who we do not
[52:41] know he's just a strange something

[53:01] known to you am and that making known to
[53:05] you we call Revelation amen and it's
[53:09] something we should be praying for all

[59:36] produces position

[59:43] Perfection be
[59:46] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[59:50] perfect if God requires that he must
[59:53] make a way for for
[59:56] that and I'm very pleased to be

[1:00:04] want to take a subject those baptized
[1:00:06] into
[1:00:07] Christ have put on Christ amen
[1:00:11] amen amen
[1:00:15] amen now I wish to get right into my
[1:00:18] sermon this morning because I got many
[1:00:20] things that I wish to share with you
[1:00:23] concerning position and
[1:00:27] adoption because I truly believe that we
[1:00:29] are living right now in the appointed
[1:00:32] time for the bride to catch
[1:00:37] this yeah the message didn't come to
[1:00:40] just teach you a church order that's
[1:00:42] right amen how to wear a dress how to
[1:00:44] have long hair all of those things no
[1:00:48] that's a part of it but to miss the
[1:00:53] understanding of why God sends a
[1:00:57] prophet God sends a prophet to bring you
[1:01:00] always back to the truth of God's
[1:01:04] absolute
[1:01:07] amen and so I believe that now the bride
[1:01:10] has come to a time of
[1:01:14] maturity she's
[1:01:16] matured she's no longer thinking as a
[1:01:19] young
[1:01:21] woman even as Sarah when the angel
[1:01:25] proclaimed to her that she's going to
[1:01:28] have a son it
[1:01:30] wasn't it wasn't
[1:01:33] immediate how how will this
[1:01:36] be and you understand at that immaturity
[1:01:40] she
[1:01:43] laughed and passed the promise for a
[1:01:48] season to
[1:01:51] Hagar yeah that's what happened and
[1:01:53] Abraham seed the right
[1:01:56] seed in the wrong woman Church brings
[1:01:59] forth an ishmail every time amen and you
[1:02:03] all know that ishmael's nature was a
[1:02:05] wild man you couldn't correct
[1:02:07] him there are ishmaelites alive today
[1:02:11] whom will not receive correction of the
[1:02:13] word of God that's why predestinated
[1:02:17] seed ordained seed yeah when they are
[1:02:21] corrected of God because a bastard child
[1:02:24] come on is without correction God does
[1:02:28] not waste his time on
[1:02:32] nonseed
[1:02:35] amen that's plain thank you Lord
[1:02:38] amen you understand that amen so if
[1:02:42] you've ever felt God to chastise you to
[1:02:46] chasen you to correct
[1:02:49] you you should just rejoice and see
[1:02:52] praise God if there's nothing else that
[1:02:55] proves to me I'm
[1:02:57] seed because if I wasn't seed he
[1:03:00] wouldn't waste
[1:03:03] his
[1:03:04] hallelujah amen amen now fruit ripens
[1:03:09] quickly at the top of the tree we know
[1:03:11] that we have had a restoration of the
[1:03:13] Bride tree amen and he says watch the
[1:03:17] fruit at the top of the tree ripens the
[1:03:20] most quick why because they catch the
[1:03:23] fullness of the Risen
[1:03:25] son are you understanding that here we
[1:03:29] are yes and and you know what in in in

[1:05:17] elect but we all know he
[1:05:23] can't do it you can try

[1:06:32] word who is this mezc hey wow he's
[1:06:38] asking questions he's making
[1:06:41] declarations to help establish you so
[1:06:44] that you know chronologically where
[1:06:46] you're
[1:06:47] at and if you understand the continual
[1:06:50] unfolding of the word even to the
[1:06:53] prophet
[1:06:54] ET that God gives him so much Revelation
[1:06:58] he's there for a season and then God
[1:07:01] sends another portion of Revelation he
[1:07:03] says oh my and it just begins to unfold
[1:07:08] and to
[1:07:09] unfold that's why we must continue to
[1:07:12] unfold with

[1:08:07] him whoa wait a second that is a
[1:08:09] powerful statement yes sir you mean to
[1:08:12] tell me that when I put on
[1:08:14] Christ when I am baptized into Christ by
[1:08:18] his spirit and uh I'm Abraham's seed and
[1:08:23] his Perfection becomes mine
[1:08:28] yeah

[1:08:34] Oneness with God Amen being united

[1:08:45] of Christ amen yes sir and giving you
[1:08:48] Revelation so that you will know who you

[1:09:01] placed yes to receive
[1:09:05] power amen thank you Lord and the end

[1:09:32] is the power of
[1:09:34] transformation it is the quickening
[1:09:36] power to transform these mortal bodies
[1:09:41] from the glory of the terrestrial to the
[1:09:44] glory of the celestial amen that's our
[1:09:47] journey upward guess what Satan's
[1:09:49] journey is downward he's going down
[1:09:54] that's right he don't like to hear
[1:09:56] it when he reminds you of your past
[1:09:58] remind him of his
[1:10:01] future Hallelujah okay Philippian church
[1:10:06] was being told by Paul they must press
[1:10:08] towards the mark of the high calling in
[1:10:11] Christ is that right that means it's
[1:10:14] higher it's upward and that's what
[1:10:17] they've got to try to strive for to
[1:10:20] enter into that listen if you're going
[1:10:22] to run the race run to win amen if
[1:10:25] you're going to fight fight to
[1:10:28] win
[1:10:31] amen now
[1:10:33] Revelation is the quickening power that
[1:10:36] opens your eyes of understanding to the
[1:10:39] word right the holy spirit is the Divine
[1:10:43] revealer of God's word without the Holy
[1:10:46] Spirit bringing to you Revelation it is
[1:10:51] a closed
[1:10:52] book amen sure now brother Brenham says
[1:10:55] this in testimony
[1:10:57] 1950 but God is in the
[1:11:02] people what makes them good marks the
[1:11:06] perfect man it's God in you that makes
[1:11:10] it perfect amen see be therefore perfect
[1:11:14] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:11:16] see be ye therefore perfect how can you
[1:11:21] be
[1:11:22] perfect yeah yeah I mean you know I
[1:11:24] stand here like that emoji we send each
[1:11:28] other how can we be
[1:11:32] perfect somebody do
[1:11:35] this yeah you're just like me hey wait a
[1:11:37] second how can
[1:11:39] I yeah so here we ask the question how
[1:11:43] can you be perfect not in
[1:11:48] yourself but in him
[1:11:52] Hallelujah GL prise the Lord God don't
[1:11:55] look at you
[1:11:58] then God don't look at you
[1:12:02] then he looks at him amen
[1:12:06] right amen see how do you get in him by
[1:12:10] one Spirit we're all baptized into one
[1:12:12] body then you're in him and when you're
[1:12:15] baptized by the holy spirit in the body
[1:12:17] it's 1 Corinthians
[1:12:19] 12 see how he brings this back to
[1:12:24] scripture takes these things how can we
[1:12:28] be perfect how can we so this Prophet
[1:12:33] begins to declare unto us the word of
[1:12:36] the Lord so that we might know who we
[1:12:38] are what is our position so that we
[1:12:41] might have power because power outside
[1:12:43] of character so what is God dealing with
[1:12:46] you right now character cuz power
[1:12:49] outside of character is satanic but
[1:12:52] Power with character is what F to rule
[1:12:55] fit to rule so now God is molding our
[1:12:59] character through the trials and the
[1:13:02] tribulations and the trying of your
[1:13:04] faith is worth to you more than precious
[1:13:07] gold amen hey I tell you what if you
[1:13:11] found a gold nugget somewhere as you're
[1:13:15] walking along the street or something
[1:13:17] like that you found a big old gold PE I
[1:13:19] guarantee you you would do a happy dance
[1:13:22] that's
[1:13:24] amen you'd
[1:13:26] say
[1:13:27] wow look what I
[1:13:30] found how much more so should the word
[1:13:33] of
[1:13:34] God when the trial you're in
[1:13:40] produces Christlike
[1:13:45] character and then you go wow now I know
[1:13:49] why God had me go through the
[1:13:52] trial some of The Darkest Hours of your
[1:13:55] life and the worst trials produce the
[1:13:58] greatest
[1:14:00] character and while you're in it you are
[1:14:04] sitting there why me why do I have to
[1:14:07] have this trial wo is me I never wanted
[1:14:11] to be job I didn't ask to be like job I
[1:14:15] don't want to be like job amen because
[1:14:18] scraping the boils on the as sheep is
[1:14:21] not what I think of oh
[1:14:27] good and yet God said have you
[1:14:32] considered my servant
[1:14:38] joob and yet job hey he looked at all of
[1:14:43] that stuff and all of it and his wife
[1:14:45] said why don't you curse God and die you
[1:14:50] speak like a foolish woman everybody's
[1:14:53] turning against him but guess what God
[1:14:56] never let me tell you it doesn't matter
[1:14:59] even your rotten attitude even if you
[1:15:03] know I didn't want to be I didn't ask
[1:15:05] for this why are you doing it but when
[1:15:08] it's all said and done when you come
[1:15:11] through the trial and God has has given
[1:15:14] you a trial by fire and all that which
[1:15:18] is impurities all of that which is wood
[1:15:21] haste double is all burned up and guess
[1:15:23] what God leaves is a residue of
[1:15:28] gold
[1:15:31] hallelujah thank you Lord for
[1:15:34] gold that's why he tells this last age I
[1:15:38] counsel of you to buy of
[1:15:40] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:15:44] mayest be rich right
[1:15:48] amen Adam was a perfect man in a perfect
[1:15:52] Edom
[1:15:54] let me tell you he was actually the
[1:15:56] first
[1:15:57] female that lost his place because Adam
[1:16:01] was
[1:16:04] both say it m male and female made he
[1:16:10] them right so Adam a
[1:16:15] byproduct because
[1:16:17] God cannot
[1:16:19] fall right but he made a byproduct the
[1:16:23] first
[1:16:24] bypro God took a portion of himself and
[1:16:29] he called it Adam he said that's me in
[1:16:31] flesh form God knowing he would be the
[1:16:35] first of a byproduct of God knowing he
[1:16:39] would fall but it was all in God's
[1:16:42] plan I will redeem Adam Adam will redeem
[1:16:46] Eve it's all a type and a shadow watch
[1:16:49] God it's my whole plan unfolding amen
[1:16:53] hallelujah thank you
[1:16:55] Lord hallelujah so now job was a perfect
[1:16:59] man the Bible says Noah and Abraham were
[1:17:03] perfect men but read their
[1:17:06] stories read the chapters of them and
[1:17:09] they all made their
[1:17:11] mistakes thank you
[1:17:13] Lord thank you Lord that they made
[1:17:16] mistakes because it gives me
[1:17:19] hope they were men of like uh passion
[1:17:24] huh on yeah because if they were without
[1:17:29] mistake How Could You attain to it they
[1:17:31] were just perfect in all their
[1:17:36] ways aimc says hey you know that woman
[1:17:40] she's pretty I'd like to have her
[1:17:42] Abraham tells s tell tell him you're my
[1:17:47] sister what you're going to give me a
[1:17:50] way to save your skin
[1:17:53] right
[1:17:55] huh so aimik says so you're who are you
[1:18:01] I'm I'm a I'm a
[1:18:05] sister
[1:18:07] huh he does not only does he do it but
[1:18:10] he does it twice and guess
[1:18:12] what Isaac does the same thing like
[1:18:15] father like
[1:18:18] son could you
[1:18:20] imagine the times after restore unto
[1:18:24] this man his
[1:18:26] wife and hey hey I didn't touch her yeah
[1:18:30] I I kept you from touching her you just
[1:18:32] laid there in your bed with your toes up
[1:18:34] and you took a bath oh tomorrow I'm
[1:18:36] going to take
[1:18:38] her he said I kept you let me tell you A
[1:18:41] lot of times you may think oh you've
[1:18:44] kept yourself oh I've been a good boy
[1:18:46] when I come through the Gates of Glory
[1:18:48] I'm going to have my head back I'm going
[1:18:49] to say open up ye gates because I was
[1:18:52] perfect in all my
[1:18:55] ways on wrong right you're going to say
[1:18:58] it was Grace it was Grace it was his
[1:19:02] Mercy it was Grace it was him wasn't
[1:19:05] nothing I did it was
[1:19:07] him yes sir absolutely
[1:19:11] okay so the Perfection that God's
[1:19:15] speaking about is not their conduct
[1:19:18] while they're here on
[1:19:20] Earth that's right but in their position
[1:19:24] in their
[1:19:26] calling very good for I want you to make
[1:19:28] your calling and your election sure sure

[1:23:25] forever and ever amen amen now let's

[1:23:33] while absolute
[1:23:36] perfection is an attribute of God Alone
[1:23:40] amen because he and he alone is perfect
[1:23:43] in all his ways that's right we are not
[1:23:47] we are born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:23:49] come into the world speaking lies and if
[1:23:51] anybody needs help we

[1:24:02] in desperation
[1:24:03] help I can't do it I've tried I've tried
[1:24:07] to be perfect yeah I tried to live

[1:24:44] Aura of I'm going to be good all day
[1:24:51] vanishes right right amen come
[1:24:55] on absolute perfection is an attribute
[1:24:58] of God Alone his Perfection then is the
[1:25:02] standard for all believers to attend to
[1:25:07] sure because it'll only be a perfect
[1:25:09] bride amen coming back by Perfect Faith
[1:25:13] Amen in a perfect
[1:25:16] Rapture into a perfect
[1:25:19] Eden into a perfect ion wow why cuz God
[1:25:24] is bringing everything back to let's say
[1:25:28] it together
[1:25:30] Perfection hallelujah thank you Lord I
[1:25:33] strive for something there's something
[1:25:36] inside of me that strives for something
[1:25:39] far greater than that which I
[1:25:42] have that's right yes I don't Glory as
[1:25:46] though I have already attained to it no
[1:25:48] I'm striving unto perfection
[1:25:53] all right
[1:25:54] so the goal and fundamental idea of
[1:25:57] perfection is for the believer to attain
[1:26:00] to by being complete in him amen thank
[1:26:04] you
[1:26:05] Lord that is the goal of every
[1:26:08] Spirit-filled
[1:26:09] believer is to be perfect in
[1:26:15] him now
[1:26:17] Perfection to the believer is the work
[1:26:20] of God himself that's right amen he does
[1:26:24] it it's not you
[1:26:30] amen I'm letting that sink
[1:26:34] in he is therefore Jehovah Gyra yes sir
[1:26:38] amen I'm the god that provides all your
[1:26:40] needs you need Perfection I got it amen

[1:26:57] he's got enough money to put gas in the
[1:26:59] car did you worry about if you know hey
[1:27:03] if Dad was there he's got
[1:27:07] it come on dad pay for the
[1:27:11] meal we even got stuck my dad had a Jeep
[1:27:14] it was a two- wheel drive jeep station
[1:27:18] wagon and we went out just kind of
[1:27:22] riding through uh the desert we were
[1:27:25] just you know and we're there and we're
[1:27:27] were that and like this and we go over a
[1:27:30] couple little heels and all of a sudden
[1:27:33] and I felt the rear end slip down into
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:41] some my
[1:27:43] brother he you know Dad Dad what are we
[1:27:47] going to do and I wanted to say ah shut

[1:28:06] under
[1:28:10] control that's the truth brother he
[1:28:12] loved you so much that while you were
[1:28:14] yet a sinner right Christ died for you
[1:28:17] not in your righteousness while you were
[1:28:19] a
[1:28:21] sinner
[1:28:23] Hallelujah he loved you despite
[1:28:27] yourself despite all of the things you
[1:28:31] would do
[1:28:32] wrong
[1:28:34] amen amen amen I'm living
[1:28:41] proof we must therefore agree with the
[1:28:44] scriptures that Christians may become
[1:28:46] perfect even while they were still in
[1:28:49] this Mortal
[1:28:50] body yes sir
[1:28:52] because he has to make that Perfection
[1:28:56] Christ has perfected us
[1:28:59] Forever by his blood in the spiritual

[1:29:07] 10:4 for by one offering has he
[1:29:10] perfected again this word Perfection
[1:29:12] keeps coming up
[1:29:15] yes he hath perfected forever them that
[1:29:18] are
[1:29:20] Sanctified and amen amen by
[1:29:26] recognizing yet watch this that though
[1:29:30] God has made a way and we realize in
[1:29:33] this Mortal body which keeps making
[1:29:36] mistakes
[1:29:37] amen is there anybody real and human
[1:29:40] here this morning come on put down your
[1:29:43] Halo let's be real this morning and
[1:29:46] realize that all of us we make our
[1:29:49] mistakes amen amen
[1:29:55] yeah so thus not only Watch God's going
[1:29:59] to make a way but we have a hard time
[1:30:01] because we're still working it out right
[1:30:04] while we're here we make our mistakes
[1:30:06] and we get disappointed in ourselves but
[1:30:09] I want you to understand God is not
[1:30:13] expecting you in this
[1:30:15] Mortal body to attain Perfection why
[1:30:19] because the body you're in is imperfect
[1:30:23] it came by sex
[1:30:25] law not by Spoken Word guess what what
[1:30:29] is the last
[1:30:30] thing of our inheritance we're going to
[1:30:33] get before we're raptured out of
[1:30:39] here why because God ain't going to let
[1:30:42] a sinful body come into His presence I'm
[1:30:46] not
[1:30:49] stuck cuz you Tred to get into the
[1:30:52] kingdom and you ain't got the right robe
[1:30:55] that's right don't get in yeah you don't
[1:30:58] get in and guess what there was a man
[1:30:59] who came to the feast and they were
[1:31:02] Jesus is walking along all of a sudden
[1:31:04] you don't have your robe yeah where's
[1:31:06] your
[1:31:10] robe how did you get in
[1:31:14] right because everybody that came in by
[1:31:16] the door the door is Christ that's right
[1:31:19] they got a new Rob but this guy didn't
[1:31:21] have robe how did you get in here well I
[1:31:23] I climbed in some other way uh there was
[1:31:26] a window
[1:31:27] open and he was cast out where Into
[1:31:31] Darkness where there was wailing and now
[1:31:34] this loving
[1:31:38] God you better you better understand
[1:31:41] God is a
[1:31:44] fearful God and we must serve him with
[1:31:48] reverence and godly fear because our God
[1:31:51] is a consuming fire he's a god of wrath
[1:31:56] and of
[1:31:57] judgment we got him that it's all love
[1:32:00] and God's going to love everybody that's
[1:32:02] the
[1:32:04] Beatles what the
[1:32:06] world needs
[1:32:08] now you think they'd say what the world
[1:32:12] needs now his fiery
[1:32:17] judgment are you kidding me because they
[1:32:20] all want to be loved
[1:32:23] huh don't denominations

[1:32:41] can just do what you want to cuz you
[1:32:43] know what you're going to be saved

[1:33:54] time because in Germany in the area of

[1:33:59] kinds of parties and Marty Gro going on
[1:34:02] and they had the costumes and and
[1:34:04] everybody and it's it it's just a big
[1:34:07] adulterous Affair so I had one I had
[1:34:09] brother Dave Cook fly over from
[1:34:12] Saskatchewan and I thought oh I want to
[1:34:14] take him to dinner okay uh let's cross
[1:34:17] the border into Holland because it's not
[1:34:19] so big over there as what it is in
[1:34:22] Germany and so we went and I wanted to
[1:34:24] take him to have Bobby punga in a in a
[1:34:27] restaurant that's my favorite meal if
[1:34:29] anybody knows besides the Hammonds
[1:34:31] that's my favorite meal Bobby pangang
[1:34:34] it's an Indonesian food and Chinese
[1:34:37] anyway I said I'm going to take Dave
[1:34:39] Cook and so we went to my favorite
[1:34:42] restaurant and we went in there
[1:34:45] and they had a band they had all the
[1:34:48] costumes and I thought oh Dave day I'm
[1:34:55] sorry he had kind of un I had no idea
[1:35:00] was going to be like this so Dave As
[1:35:03] Nice and cordially as is we sit down and
[1:35:05] we try to order you have to scream
[1:35:08] through the music your order and finally
[1:35:10] they bring it and finally we eat it I
[1:35:13] can't wait to get out of there
[1:35:15] everything so we get up to go and guess
[1:35:18] what the ladies that are singing and
[1:35:21] dancing they come over to Dave Cook
[1:35:23] stand up
[1:35:24] brother no I was going to dance with him
[1:35:28] but they grabbed a hold of Dave Cook big
[1:35:32] 360
[1:35:34] lbs they grab him and start dancing and
[1:35:39] he dances her to the door thank you
[1:35:41] [Laughter]
[1:35:45] goodbye and you know what he said to me
[1:35:47] brother Dave Cook H it's amazing to see
[1:35:51] what the Believers in Europe do for
[1:35:56] Fellowship I said Dave this isn't what
[1:35:59] we
[1:36:01] do anyway maybe some of you would enjoy
[1:36:05] it but I
[1:36:08] now I want you to understand that the
[1:36:11] Bible declares that a man can become
[1:36:13] perfect only by his position in your
[1:36:17] union to
[1:36:19] Christ that is by a spiritual baptism of
[1:36:23] the Holy Ghost which is called the Seal
[1:36:26] of God brother Ram said you take all of
[1:36:29] my sermons the greatest of all sermons
[1:36:33] The Capstone of my Ministry I titled the
[1:36:36] sermon the
[1:36:42] token in the Old
[1:36:44] Testament Abraham was given a sign of
[1:36:49] circumcision in the New Testament
[1:36:52] it is called the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:55] Ghost being baptized into Christ you
[1:36:58] have put on
[1:37:01] Christ by being in Christ the Believers
[1:37:05] acquire a perfect position than you Lord
[1:37:09] wow I'm in
[1:37:14] him because
[1:37:18] Christ is identified in every age that's
[1:37:22] right in every
[1:37:26] generation understand that the message
[1:37:29] Believers in every age become the
[1:37:32] identified Christ of that
[1:37:35] age that anointing that was poured out
[1:37:38] in the time of
[1:37:41] Luther they came under that anointing
[1:37:45] and they became and acquired the
[1:37:48] position for that hour amen and and then
[1:37:51] God moves on he goes to Wesley and he
[1:37:54] goes on and on down to the age of
[1:37:57] laiaa until it is the darkest and the
[1:38:00] worst of all ages and yet God is still
[1:38:05] perfecting a bride
[1:38:10] Now understand he's not looking at you
[1:38:13] amen he's looking at the Christ in you
[1:38:18] thank therefore when God looks at you he
[1:38:21] doesn't see you he sees Christ brother
[1:38:24] Brenham gives the illustration he said
[1:38:26] when you pray and you have the token in
[1:38:29] your life which is the Life of Christ
[1:38:33] that is the Seal of God it is the blood
[1:38:36] being applied he said when you pray he
[1:38:39] says your voice goes through that blood
[1:38:43] right and it has an
[1:38:46] ability
[1:38:47] to exchange your voice for his
[1:38:51] wow and he says and now when you pray
[1:38:54] it's not your voice it's
[1:38:56] his just think of
[1:38:59] that
[1:39:01] wow
[1:39:03] God talking to God Amen our father Yes
[1:39:09] Who Art in Heaven
[1:39:11] amen do you see it was deity talking to

[1:39:26] somebody say hurry up okay all right
[1:39:30] Colossians 2
[1:39:32] 8-15 beware lested any man spoil you
[1:39:35] through philosophy and vain deceit after
[1:39:38] the tradition of men after the rudiments
[1:39:40] of the world and not after
[1:39:43] Christ for in him dwelleth all the
[1:39:46] fullness of the godhead bodily ye are
[1:39:49] complete in him right
[1:39:51] thank you Lord which is the head of all
[1:39:53] principality and Power in whom ye also
[1:39:57] are circumcised with the
[1:40:00] circumcision made without hands in
[1:40:03] putting off the body of the sins of the
[1:40:05] flesh by the circumcision of
[1:40:09] Christ buried with him in
[1:40:12] baptism wherein you also are risen with
[1:40:15] him through the faith of the operation
[1:40:17] of god wow what it's all him he's doing
[1:40:21] it the operation of God is he's doing
[1:40:25] it who raised him from the dead and you
[1:40:28] being dead in your sins and the
[1:40:30] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[1:40:34] quickened together with him
[1:40:37] am amen wow having forgiven a few of
[1:40:43] your
[1:40:46] trespasses that may be in the new
[1:40:48] revised standard
[1:40:52] of the watering down Bibles they're
[1:40:55] putting out in fact they they have made
[1:40:58] the new Bibles
[1:41:02] genderless and another thing because
[1:41:05] they will not say our father they'll say
[1:41:07] the great being in heaven oh my they
[1:41:11] won't say male nor female why because
[1:41:13] they don't even know what they are
[1:41:15] that's right they have no
[1:41:18] identity but eled have identity
[1:41:22] brother Brenham said watch in this end
[1:41:24] time many of them he says she wears his
[1:41:28] clothes he wears her clothes she cuts
[1:41:31] her hair like a man and he wears his
[1:41:33] hair like a woman amen amen amen it's
[1:41:37] vice versa he said it's a
[1:41:39] spirit and it's getting
[1:41:41] worse they don't even know who they
[1:41:44] are they don't even know what gender how
[1:41:47] many genders do we have listen if you
[1:41:50] you would have asked that question 10
[1:41:52] years ago you'd have been laughed
[1:41:55] silly oh I think there's
[1:41:58] five whatever are you kidding me
[1:42:03] huh there's only two boxes on the birth
[1:42:07] certificate he's either male or
[1:42:10] female but that was old time now you see
[1:42:13] they've gotten so far out
[1:42:15] see anyway let me go on we have been
[1:42:19] quickened together and have forgiven all
[1:42:21] our trespasses blotting out the
[1:42:23] handwritings of ordinances that was
[1:42:25] against
[1:42:27] us which was contrary to us and took it
[1:42:30] out of the way kneeling it to the
[1:42:37] Cross amen he took my place and having
[1:42:41] spoiled
[1:42:42] principalities and
[1:42:45] Powers he made a show of them
[1:42:49] openly triumphing
[1:42:51] over there over them in it the baptism
[1:42:54] of the Holy Ghost brings a Believer into
[1:42:56] the
[1:42:57] position of the Perfection that is in
[1:43:01] Christ
[1:43:03] amen Galatians 3:
[1:43:06] 26-29 and ye are all the children of God
[1:43:09] by faith in Christ
[1:43:11] Jesus for as many of you have been
[1:43:14] baptized into Christ have put on
[1:43:17] Christ again think of this yeah there's
[1:43:21] neither Jew nor Greek Now understand
[1:43:23] when you're in
[1:43:26] Christ there's neither Bond nor free Jew
[1:43:30] nor
[1:43:31] Gentile male nor
[1:43:33] female wow look at this when you come
[1:43:38] into it for ye are all one in Christ
[1:43:41] Jesus and then if you be Christ then
[1:43:44] you're Abraham's seed and according to
[1:43:46] the promise now brother brand picks this
[1:43:48] up in the end time seed sign
[1:43:52] he says now what's happening I'm closing
[1:43:55] I might say this friends the church is
[1:43:57] coming forth God's going to have a
[1:43:59] church without spot or wrinkle and she's
[1:44:04] predestinated he's going to have a body
[1:44:06] without spot or
[1:44:10] wrinkle as God in his word made manifest
[1:44:14] in a man a perfect man so is god with
[1:44:18] his word coming again making himself
[1:44:21] manifest in a bride amen Amen brother
[1:44:25] brandom says in another quote this is
[1:44:27] the bride coming of
[1:44:28] Christ this is the restoration of the
[1:44:31] Bride tree
[1:44:35] amen but the unadulterated word of God
[1:44:38] will be born into that church and she'll
[1:44:40] stand like Jesus Christ did and with his
[1:44:44] Spirit anointing in in his word amen I
[1:44:47] believe it's the announcement now amen
[1:44:51] what was he what was he doing he was
[1:44:53] making the announcement do you know it
[1:44:56] actually the word message and he brought
[1:44:59] forth his message it means in an
[1:45:03] announcement
[1:45:06] amen within those seven mysterious
[1:45:09] Thunders which will be made known and
[1:45:11] brother Bram said it is those seven
[1:45:14] mysterious
[1:45:16] Thunders he said that to my opinion will
[1:45:20] cause rapturing Faith to the going away
[1:45:23] the BR somebody say Amen I'm not trying
[1:45:26] to trick
[1:45:29] you and when the seven seal mystery of
[1:45:32] the book was open God circumcised listen
[1:45:35] to this God circumcised this message
[1:45:39] from Clarence
[1:45:41] linen hops to
[1:45:44] Babylons prasan
[1:45:47] fathers brother Brenham put himself away
[1:45:51] into it locked himself into a room I'm
[1:45:53] not even going outside I'm waiting here
[1:45:56] and he says this first seal oh God I
[1:45:58] have no idea what it means so he says I
[1:46:01] went back and I started looking at my
[1:46:02] old notes oh who is this white horse
[1:46:05] rider writing down through it must be
[1:46:09] Christ and he says then supernaturally
[1:46:11] an
[1:46:14] angel amen I want you to understand the
[1:46:17] angel of the first
[1:46:19] seal
[1:46:21] he said it is not Jesus Christ it's the
[1:46:26] Antichrist I would have made a horrible
[1:46:29] mistake amen do you understand now what
[1:46:32] God is doing is he's circumcising this
[1:46:36] message away from all kinds of knowledge
[1:46:39] and teaching of man and church and all
[1:46:42] of the things down Through the Ages now
[1:46:46] what God is doing is he's taking away
[1:46:48] all of the humanity and carnal knowledge
[1:46:52] and men's thinking and
[1:46:55] interpretations and giving us Theus
[1:46:58] sayth the Lord can you say Amen to
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:04] that Hallelujah and now it becomes an
[1:47:06] unadulterated word of God even while
[1:47:09] he's doing questions and answers on the
[1:47:11] seals and he answers something
[1:47:14] wrong he says oh wait a second wait a
[1:47:17] second is everybody okay somebody feels
[1:47:19] sick
[1:47:21] what's wrong somebody said read the
[1:47:22] question
[1:47:24] again okay he goes back reads the oh my
[1:47:28] if that isn't
[1:47:32] God he said right here he wouldn't allow
[1:47:35] me to answer that
[1:47:38] incorrectly wow there's God watching
[1:47:40] over his word
[1:47:43] amen thank you
[1:47:46] Lord Revelations 19: 6 and 10 and and I
[1:47:50] heard as it were the voice of a great
[1:47:52] multitude as the voice of many
[1:47:55] Waters and the voice of Mighty
[1:47:58] thundering singing Allelujah for the
[1:48:00] Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad
[1:48:04] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[1:48:06] the marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[1:48:09] wife ha made herself ready let me just
[1:48:12] put it back on you if you miss it it's
[1:48:14] because you failed to make
[1:48:19] ready don't blame the
[1:48:21] preacher don't blame anybody else if you
[1:48:24] miss it because the Bible says the Bride
[1:48:27] made
[1:48:28] herself
[1:48:32] ready amen and to her was granted that
[1:48:36] she should be arrayed in fine linen
[1:48:38] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:48:41] the righteousness of the Saints and he
[1:48:43] saith unto them blessed are they which
[1:48:45] are called unto the married supper of
[1:48:47] the lamb and he saith unto them these
[1:48:50] these are the true sayings of God and I
[1:48:52] fell at his feet to worship Him the
[1:48:56] angel and he said see thou do it not I
[1:48:59] am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:49:02] Brethren that have the testimony of
[1:49:05] Jesus worship God for the
[1:49:10] testimony of
[1:49:13] Jesus is the spirit of
[1:49:18] Prophecy the bride will have the
[1:49:20] testimony she understands
[1:49:23] prophecy
[1:49:25] those um within the message that are
[1:49:29] preaching from the glare of another
[1:49:31] age are not preaching a Perfection
[1:49:34] ministry right right they're wanting you
[1:49:37] to go back he said go back
[1:49:40] Pentecost no wait a second we come
[1:49:42] through
[1:49:43] Pentecost brother R say I've heard a
[1:49:45] sermon where Pentecost failed how many
[1:49:48] of you heard it if you haven't heard it
[1:49:49] go back and listen listen to it why are
[1:49:51] we against organized religion come on
[1:49:54] why are we not a denomination he
[1:49:57] answered all these things amen he says
[1:50:00] you can't feed the bride of Christ
[1:50:02] Pentecostalism that's correct well
[1:50:04] brother Brenham are you against shouting
[1:50:06] no I believe in shouting are you against
[1:50:08] Dan no I'm not against dancing are you
[1:50:12] against all speaking no I'm not against
[1:50:14] speaking in tongues that's true uh he
[1:50:17] says but I've seen witches and wizards
[1:50:20] that's right and he preaches a sermon
[1:50:22] called the anointed ones at the end time
[1:50:24] and he says look don't judge them by
[1:50:26] their
[1:50:29] anointing he said but look for the
[1:50:33] fruit where does all of the shouting
[1:50:35] jumping dancing and hollering where does
[1:50:38] that get you if it's
[1:50:40] not based upon a word revelation to you
[1:50:45] it's just human emotion which you get an
[1:50:48] influenced by one another and you catch
[1:50:50] one another's spirit and when it's all
[1:50:52] said and done and the emotion leaves you
[1:50:54] where does it leave you I'll give you a
[1:50:56] quote he said
[1:50:58] defeated well I
[1:51:01] thought because the Pastor said
[1:51:06] Hallelujah if the Holy Spirit ever gets
[1:51:10] on you why you it'll be tongue talking
[1:51:13] asks 238
[1:51:16] babies and the next thing you know you
[1:51:19] got a preconceived idea so are young
[1:51:22] people H I got to do that

[1:55:12] cares
[1:55:13] who if I saw you guys do it I might spit

[1:55:29] he loves me amen and I he said these
[1:55:32] words I don't know why he
[1:55:35] does but he
[1:55:37] did Hallelujah he didn't have
[1:55:40] to but he did and he kept saying it and
[1:55:44] when he did sister Anita the Holy Spirit
[1:55:46] came down in such a way says he did
[1:55:49] didn't have to right but he did and he
[1:55:53] starts weeping and the presence of God
[1:55:56] came so strong in that car how many of
[1:55:58] you believe you can say the right thing
[1:56:01] you can be somewhere and all of a sudden
[1:56:03] God is so pleased with what you said he
[1:56:07] couldn't control the car he pulls it off
[1:56:09] the side of the road we don't have to
[1:56:11] say anything we bust the doors out and
[1:56:13] he and I run like two crazy man in the
[1:56:17] woods praising and leeping and jumping
[1:56:21] and just about the time we go to get
[1:56:23] back in the car it comes on us
[1:56:27] again it wasn't in a
[1:56:30] meeting it was just in his
[1:56:33] presence I love his
[1:56:36] presence okay I want to go on I want to
[1:56:38] go
[1:56:39] on all right okay okay we may go into
[1:56:48] overtime Abraham could not produce the
[1:56:51] real seed within his own ability you
[1:56:55] agree he tried everything right and when
[1:56:59] his body was as good as dead and Sarah
[1:57:02] her body was dead also is that right so
[1:57:06] now it's
[1:57:07] impossible that's it Abraham could not
[1:57:10] produce the Royal seed in his own
[1:57:13] flesh Sarah's womb was as good as dead
[1:57:17] in their flesh it was not possible ible
[1:57:20] see and so God came down he said I'm
[1:57:22] Jehovah Gyra I'm going to come down
[1:57:25] don't you know who I am I'm Eli I'm MDC
[1:57:29] and so he comes down and gives them
[1:57:32] you're not your name is no longer Abram
[1:57:34] it's Abraham you are not Sarah you're
[1:57:37] Sarah and I have joined it's an
[1:57:39] invisible Union if you can understand he
[1:57:42] came down joined himself Hallelujah when
[1:57:45] he
[1:57:46] did Abraham it was in do it unto him for
[1:57:53] righteousness
[1:58:00] oh Lord and now God what did he do I'll
[1:58:03] bring it to pass
[1:58:05] Abraham I am the almighty God yes sir
[1:58:09] it's not you it's me Abraham right I've
[1:58:12] been waiting for you to just say I can't
[1:58:16] do it I'm finished and sometimes God
[1:58:20] Waits you for you you say I can sail my
[1:58:23] ship I it's okay I've been in storms
[1:58:26] like this before so he lets you sail
[1:58:28] your
[1:58:30] boat and he goes into the back hinder
[1:58:33] part of the ship and goes to
[1:58:35] sleep come on then we go wake him up
[1:58:38] takeing on water what's an amazing thing

[1:58:52] me isn't it amazing when we are in fear

[2:02:39] a fish so
[2:02:42] big but up there they fish differently
[2:02:45] they let it go a little bit
[2:02:47] deeper and some of you have not been
[2:02:50] going deep
[2:02:52] enough that's what Peter and him did
[2:02:54] they fished all
[2:02:56] night Hallelujah he says cast your net
[2:03:00] again this time Let It Go
[2:03:03] real
[2:03:05] deep wait a wait a while and before you
[2:03:08] start pulling it in let it go down and
[2:03:11] all of a sudden they start pulling it in
[2:03:13] and they feel like oh my and now they've
[2:03:16] got so many fish they fished all night
[2:03:18] and didn't get
[2:03:22] nothing sometimes God just needs to give
[2:03:24] you a word in season and you're ready to
[2:03:28] get the biggest haul you've ever had in
[2:03:31] your life am but he waits until you're
[2:03:34] done Peter are you done have you caught

[2:03:58] story and it was so much that it starts
[2:04:01] to break the net so much so that they
[2:04:04] they have to get everybody to haul it
[2:04:06] in and then Peter
[2:04:11] says who is that on the
[2:04:17] shoreline
[2:04:19] Revelation yeah that's what happens to
[2:04:22] you it's him amen I thought it was just
[2:04:26] some guy had a little fire on the
[2:04:30] beach and it was
[2:04:32] him sometimes God disguises
[2:04:37] himself and it's him he's telling you
[2:04:41] giving you a he's giving you a word in
[2:04:44] season if some of you when you are in
[2:04:47] these times when you have fished and you
[2:04:50] have done all and you have sought God
[2:04:52] for an answer for something in your
[2:04:55] life he's waiting for you to realize

[2:05:34] anyway change of
[2:05:37] ministry is a Perfection
[2:05:40] Ministry if the ministry didn't change
[2:05:42] in brother brandham there would have
[2:05:43] been no third
[2:05:46] pull don't tell everybody about it this
[2:05:50] is
[2:05:51] Reverend this is Holy I don't want you
[2:05:53] to tell anybody about it
[2:05:57] huh now there's a major Doctrine going
[2:06:00] around in the message you get your
[2:06:03] Perfection by pressing
[2:06:07] play brother renom addresses that watch
[2:06:10] this you want to see the answer
[2:06:11] questions answers
[2:06:13] 1964 dearly beloved let's see about the
[2:06:16] scripture of Ephesians 4:11
[2:06:19] through
[2:06:20] 13 let's see do we get all the
[2:06:22] perfecting of saints through the
[2:06:25] tapes or should we be here where the
[2:06:27] gifts of the Spirit are operating and
[2:06:29] different offices of the church to help
[2:06:31] perfect us our hearts have believed all
[2:06:35] the word of the Lord oh this person's
[2:06:37] from Oregon he goes on on might have
[2:06:39] been last Sunday
[2:06:41] no I want you to come here to the church
[2:06:43] for the perfecting excuse me excuse me
[2:06:47] they want you to come here to the church
[2:06:49] for perfecting see that we get
[2:06:52] Fellowship one with another here at the
[2:06:54] church but the perfecting comes between
[2:06:57] us and
[2:07:00] God the blood of Christ is what perfects
[2:07:04] Us in the holy spirit amen not press
[2:07:06] play right right because you know a lot
[2:07:09] of the people will press play and go to
[2:07:10] sleep
[2:07:12] that's you see they've replaced lighting
[2:07:15] candles with press
[2:07:17] play
[2:07:19] come
[2:07:19] on you see that Catholic
[2:07:24] Spirit e
[2:07:26] [Music]
[2:07:28] sp22 you don't need to light a
[2:07:33] candle you just press
[2:07:37] play and you are
[2:07:40] perfected while you sleep vast majority
[2:07:44] of them because there is no getting
[2:07:47] ready
[2:07:49] listening and under anticipation because
[2:07:52] Ephesians 4
[2:07:55] says that God sent some Apostles some
[2:07:58] Prophets You Know evangelist pastors for
[2:08:01] the what perfecting of the Saints press
[2:08:05] play doesn't do that now if you ex if
[2:08:09] you
[2:08:10] exclude the rest of the four four out of
[2:08:14] the fivefold ministry you don't have
[2:08:17] everything you need to get you out of
[2:08:18] here because it's for the listen don't
[2:08:21] cut up the
[2:08:23] word don't take what you
[2:08:26] want amen and leave what you don't
[2:08:32] want perfecting belongs to the body of
[2:08:35] Christ
[2:08:38] amen in the UN unconditional Covenant
[2:08:41] with god with the people will you give
[2:08:44] me a couple more
[2:08:45] minutes but I am not what I I am who I
[2:08:49] am it's the Perfection of Jesus Christ
[2:08:52] in God that died in my place to make me
[2:08:56] what I am it isn't whether I can stand I
[2:09:00] can't it's whether he stood in my place
[2:09:03] Amen brother that makes a Baptist
[2:09:09] shout it'll make a fossilized message
[2:09:13] believer shout amen hallelujah you might
[2:09:17] even get happy yeah yeah like one sister
[2:09:20] told me went brother that word was
[2:09:23] coming
[2:09:25] so I almost said
[2:09:29] amen break the sound barrier once in a
[2:09:32] while Amen brother wrong that's nothing
[2:09:35] but the truth and then all of a
[2:09:39] sudden huh had he
[2:09:42] right that ain't nothing but the truth
[2:09:45] brother REM just telling a story that
[2:09:46] ain't nothing but the truth man I tell
[2:09:49] you what activate the faith that you
[2:09:51] have and what God is speaking to you
[2:09:53] that ain't nothing but the truth and
[2:09:55] watch what God will do I ask you I
[2:09:59] challenge you to put him to the test
[2:10:02] amen
[2:10:04] amen thank you
[2:10:10] Lord your Perfection is connected to
[2:10:13] your position in
[2:10:15] Christ I hope I'm making it clear amen
[2:10:18] all right perfect Faith
[2:10:26] 1963 this is coming into that third pole
[2:10:29] I'm believing
[2:10:31] it this is just starting to bloom now
[2:10:35] just started I did this for a purpose I
[2:10:37] did this for a purpose I'm working out
[2:10:39] something see it's taking this charge of
[2:10:42] faith and going right back to begin and
[2:10:45] come in see kind of raise faith in a
[2:10:48] bracket where you've never noticed it in
[2:10:50] that way before not a faith but a
[2:10:53] perfect
[2:10:55] Faith built it up here and watch a
[2:10:58] perfect god with a perfect heart make a
[2:11:01] perfect Promise by his perfect word
[2:11:03] which is sharper than any two sword and
[2:11:05] a discerner of the thoughts of the heart
[2:11:08] we are coming now to the Perfection
[2:11:10] because the people has got to come to
[2:11:13] this in order for the Rapture
[2:11:16] amen amen that's what's holding it
[2:11:20] away it's waiting for that church to
[2:11:22] come into that perfect raptured Faith
[2:11:25] amen looking for it it means a lot of
[2:11:28] Shaving down for me it means a lot for
[2:11:30] you and together we'll make it by the
[2:11:32] grace of God and a Church of the Living
[2:11:34] God said
[2:11:36] amen amen hold on we'll make
[2:11:40] it brother Ben God ain't looking at
[2:11:45] you thank you
[2:11:47] Lord
[2:11:50] amen third pole is anointing on the
[2:11:53] bride to speak the word see the revealed
[2:11:55] word is moving her into her position
[2:12:02] right Israel and the church
[2:12:05] 1953 confirming his word that
[2:12:08] someday we who turn old and gray and 70
[2:12:11] years
[2:12:13] old someday we'll spring
[2:12:17] back you're you're Johnny you're closer
[2:12:19] to 20 than you've ever been amen someday
[2:12:23] we'll spring back to a young man and
[2:12:24] young woman again but all that death can
[2:12:26] do is just take us away then it's
[2:12:28] finished then all the doubting part and
[2:12:31] everything it's like the man's life in
[2:12:33] here has gone out and there's nothing
[2:12:36] left but per
[2:12:40] Perfection than is that what he said
[2:12:43] Sergio are you reading that look at that
[2:12:47] what this body he was when it was in
[2:12:49] Perfection What God intended when it was
[2:12:52] it resurrection and Resurrection it'll
[2:12:55] be
[2:12:57] Perfection wow thank you Lord it's not
[2:13:00] just a mythical
[2:13:02] Dream It's thus sayith the Lord amen God
[2:13:06] said so then I'll base my life right
[2:13:08] there yes sir God said so that settles

[2:18:08] enough it's about whether he's good
[2:18:12] enough I have a
[2:18:14] mediator I have an advocate that when I

[2:18:40] your honor and he just begins to now lay
[2:18:43] it all out

[2:20:33] forgetfulness many of you I want you to
[2:20:35] understand that when you ask God to
[2:20:37] forgive you and you put it under the
[2:20:38] blood it's into the sea of his
[2:20:40] forgetfulness and not even God can pull
[2:20:43] it
