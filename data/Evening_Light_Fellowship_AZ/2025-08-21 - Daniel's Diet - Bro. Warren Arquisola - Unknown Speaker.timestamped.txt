[12:43] cleansing power revealing
[12:46] how he gave lame to walk again. He
[12:50] caused the blind to see.
[12:54] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and
[12:58] heal my broken spirit."
[13:01] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[13:06] the victory.

[26:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:30] Lord, tonight I ask your your Holy

[27:52] name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[28:02] Before I preach,
[28:06] I saw this from the news
[28:10] uh I think two months ago.
[28:15] Thank you musicians.
[28:18] I almost forget again.
[28:27] On June 12, Air India, how many of you
[28:31] heard about the crash?
[28:35] On June 12, Air India
[28:38] flight 171
[28:41] from Amedabad or Ameabad
[28:45] to England. There were 242
[28:49] people on board
[28:53] and just 30 seconds after the takeoff,
[28:57] the plane crashed into
[29:00] the neighborhood. Everyone on board lost
[29:03] their lives.
[29:05] But there's one her name Boommy Chuan a
[29:11] 20 year uh 28 years old
[29:14] student from UK.
[29:17] She was supposed to that flight her seat
[29:21] was 36G
[29:25] but she missed boarding by just 10
[29:28] minutes
[29:32] because because why? Because of the
[29:35] traffic in India.
[29:39] So because of the traffic in the city,
[29:43] she was frustrated and disappointed.
[29:50] She said, "We got very angry with the
[29:53] driver.
[29:55] I cried and begged to the airline staff
[29:59] just only 10 minutes late
[30:02] and to let me her uh to to let me in but
[30:06] they refused.
[30:08] She was heartbroken
[30:10] sitting the near nearby comp cafe
[30:14] ordered tea and called her travel agent
[30:18] and complained.
[30:21] Then she got the news the very plane she
[30:25] missed had crashed.
[30:28] Bowie survived because of the traffic
[30:31] jam.
[30:35] So when she was interviewed by the BBC
[30:37] news,
[30:39] she said this is a totally
[30:44] miracle
[30:47] because of the traffic.
[30:49] How many of us
[30:52] sometimes frustrated if somebody will
[30:55] overtake you? Somebody you're in the
[30:58] middle of the traffic.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we need to take a deep breath.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; And you ask to yourself, a son of God,
[31:11] &gt;&gt; everything that happened to you
[31:14] &gt;&gt; and to me is not by chance. But God has
[31:18] a purpose.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; How about if there was no traffic that
[31:22] day?
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Boommy Choan
[31:26] was one of the casualty.
[31:29] But because of the traffic, it's a
[31:32] blessings in disguise.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; But to us brothers and sisters,
[31:38] everything that happens happens.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; It's the footstep of the righteous
[31:44] &gt;&gt; are ordered by the Lord. Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; And I was like thinking about this. I I
[31:49] I I I cannot wait to share this to the
[31:52] people because don't be frustrated.
[31:55] Don't be upset. Don't be angry.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; You bless the people that overtakes you.
[32:03] How many
[32:05] died because of the road rage?
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[32:10] But I believe we're not the one that get
[32:14] upset if somebody will overtakes us.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I have a very strange title
[32:24] tonight. I don't know if the title of
[32:28] the message tonight is Daniel's diet.
[32:35] So we will stand up and read the
[32:38] scripture.
[32:39] We will eat good food tonight, but it's
[32:42] healthy. Brother Peter,
[32:47] I will not let you eat the tortilla
[32:50] tonight.
[32:54] Daniel 1 to 20.
[32:57] Oh, just just 20.
[33:04] Well, I thank the Lord for the
[33:07] opportunity to stand behind this pullpit
[33:09] again. And I thank God for brother Ru at
[33:13] allowing me to
[33:15] stand here.
[33:18] In the third year of the reign of
[33:20] Jehoakim, king of Judah, came
[33:22] Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, into
[33:25] Jerusalem and besieged it. And the Lord
[33:29] gave Joakim, king of Judah, into his
[33:32] hand with part of the vessel of the
[33:34] house of God, which he carried into the
[33:37] land of Shinar, to the house of his God.
[33:41] And he brought the vessel into the
[33:43] treasure
[33:44] house of his God. And the king spake
[33:48] into Ashpinh
[33:51] the master of his unuks that he should
[33:54] bring certain of the children of Israel
[33:57] and of the king's seed and of the uh
[34:00] princes children in whom was no blemish
[34:05] but will favored and skillful in all
[34:08] wisdom and cunning in knowledge and
[34:12] understanding science and such as had
[34:15] ability in them to stand in the king's
[34:18] palace and whom they might teach the
[34:21] learning and the tongue of the Chaldans.
[34:25] And the king appointed them in daily
[34:27] probition of the king's meat and of the
[34:31] wine which he drunk.
[34:34] So nourishing them three years that eat
[34:37] the and at the end thereof they might
[34:40] stand before the king. Now among these
[34:44] were of the children of Judah, Daniel,
[34:48] Haniah, Mishael, and Assaria, and to
[34:52] whom the prince of the Unuk gave name
[34:56] for the uh for he gave Daniel
[35:00] the name Beltacar,
[35:03] and Hana, Sadrach, and to Mael, Mishak,
[35:08] and to Assyria of Abednego.
[35:12] But Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[35:16] would not defile himself with a portion
[35:19] of the king's meat, nor with the wine
[35:23] which he drunk thereof. He requested of
[35:26] the prince of the unuk that he might not
[35:29] defile himself. Now God had brought
[35:33] Daniel into a favor uh into favor and
[35:36] tender love with prince of unuk. And the
[35:39] prince of the unuk said unto Daniel, I
[35:42] fear my lord the king who hath appointed
[35:45] your meat and your drink for my my uh
[35:49] for why should he
[35:52] then shall ye make me uh in danger of my
[35:55] head uh to the king. Then Daniel to
[36:00] Milsar, whom the prince of the unic had
[36:03] set unto Daniel, Hanama, Mael, and
[36:06] Hesaria. Prove thy servants, I beseech
[36:09] thee, just 10 days, and let them give us
[36:13] pulse to eat, and water to drink.
[36:19] And let our countenance countenance be
[36:23] looked upon before thee, and the
[36:25] countenance of the children that eat of
[36:28] the portion of the king's meat. And as
[36:32] thou seeest, deal with thy servants, so
[36:36] he cons uh consented to them in this
[36:39] matter, and proved them 10 days. And at
[36:42] the end of 10 days, their countenance
[36:45] appeared fairer, fatter in flesh than
[36:50] all children which did eat the portion
[36:53] of the king's meat, powerful food.
[36:58] As for the four children,
[37:01] God gave them knowledge and skills
[37:07] in all learning and wisdom. And Daniel
[37:11] had understanding in all visions and
[37:13] dreams. Now at the end of days of the
[37:17] days the king had said he should bring
[37:20] them in. Then the prince of the unuk
[37:23] brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
[37:26] And the king consumed with them. And
[37:29] among them all was found none like
[37:32] Daniel, Haniah, Michel and Azariah
[37:37] before stood before the king and all
[37:42] matters of wisdom and understanding that
[37:46] the king inquired of them. He found them
[37:50] 10 times better than all of the
[37:54] magicians and astron astrologers
[37:58] that were in all his realm. May God
[38:02] bless the reading of the word. You may
[38:04] be seated. Amen.
[38:07] I will read in 1 Corinthian chapter
[38:10] 2:15.
[38:18] It said here, "But he that is spiritual
[38:23] judgeth all things, yet he himself is
[38:28] judge of no man."
[38:31] Praise the Lord. For who hath know the
[38:34] mind known the mind of the Lord, that he
[38:38] may instruct him, but he have the mind
[38:42] of Christ.
[38:45] Can you see the pattern of Daniel and
[38:48] Paul speaking to the believers
[38:51] &gt;&gt; that we have the wisdom that that the
[38:54] world cannot have.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; We have more wisdom than any others. We
[38:59] cannot that's why we cannot judge other
[39:01] people
[39:05] &gt;&gt; because we're not a judge here right
[39:07] now. But the word that we speak is the
[39:10] word that will judge.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] Amen.
[39:14] I was I was in uh Safeway
[39:19] and there was a uh uh you know the
[39:23] sometimes the uh there was uh like uh
[39:26] sound or music and then advertisement.
[39:30] He said if you want a superfood just go
[39:32] to the aisle uh something 25
[39:36] and superfood. I said maybe I will take
[39:41] uh I will study about the superfood.
[39:45] So when I was searching superfood,
[39:48] it shows that Daniel's diet.
[39:52] I said that's a good topic. Daniel's
[39:55] diet.
[39:56] Amen.
[39:58] Now why the children of Israel are in
[40:02] Babylon?
[40:04] That's a good question, right? Because
[40:06] we cannot start in Babylon.
[40:10] Why the children of Israel, they are the
[40:13] children of God. They were chosen by
[40:16] God. Why they were in Babylon? So if you
[40:20] go back to 32
[40:26] years ago,
[40:27] it started
[40:30] in the age of Solomon
[40:33] in first king chapter 11.
[40:36] Solomon said uh the the Bible said, "But
[40:39] King Solomon loved many strange women
[40:45] together with the daughter of Pharaoh,
[40:48] women of Moabites, Ammonites,
[40:52] Sidonians, and Hetites."
[40:56] So because he loved those women,
[40:59] women brought their gods
[41:03] &gt;&gt; and goddesses,
[41:06] don't go into them, neither the Bible
[41:09] said, don't go into them, neither shall
[41:12] come to you,
[41:15] for they will uh turn away your heart
[41:21] &gt;&gt; after their gods.
[41:23] Don't go to them
[41:25] &gt;&gt; or don't let them come to you because
[41:28] they will turn your heart.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; You serve only to the God of Abraham,
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Isaac, Jacob,
[41:38] but don't you serve the God of all or or
[41:43] the Hittites.
[41:45] So now because of King Solomon
[41:50] when he died,
[41:53] Rhoboam his son became a king
[41:57] and he followed the footstep of his
[42:00] daddy.
[42:03] He served. He he he kicked out all the
[42:07] councils of Solomon and he invited young
[42:11] men
[42:12] that he grew up with
[42:15] and the the young man became the
[42:17] counselor and they advised s uh uh
[42:20] Rhuboam
[42:22] a bad a bad advice.
[42:25] So now you will question why there were
[42:28] two kingdoms
[42:30] supposed to be there's only one kingdom
[42:31] in Israel
[42:33] but because of Rhoboam
[42:37] the 12 tribes split in two. So Rehoboam
[42:42] the tribes that uh decided to stick with
[42:45] him was Judah and Benjamin.
[42:49] And the 10 tribes was looking for
[42:53] another king and they found Rehob not
[42:56] Rioam Jeroboam.
[42:59] Rhoboam and Jeroboam.
[43:02] So Jeroboam
[43:05] he came from the lineage of Ephraim.
[43:10] So now when he got the 10 tribes he keep
[43:15] thinking that he will rule forever. So
[43:18] he said maybe the people will go back to
[43:22] worship God in Israel
[43:27] or Jerusalem
[43:31] because there's only one temple worship
[43:33] and that is in Jerusalem the temple of
[43:36] Solomon. So he was thinking maybe
[43:40] I can let them worship here.
[43:44] So now if you go back to Kings 12 or
[43:48] first Kings 12 28
[43:57] he said here the Bible said here
[43:59] whereupon the king took counsel and made
[44:03] two calves of gold and said unto them it
[44:07] is not too much for you to go up to
[44:10] Jerusalem.
[44:12] Behold thy gods.
[44:15] You can worship here.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Why you travel 40 minutes drive? Or
[44:20] brother Ruben, why you come here?
[44:22] There's so many churches in Dwey
[44:25] &gt;&gt; or in Prescuit Valley.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; So now he said, "Behold thy gods, oh
[44:35] Israel, which brought thee up out of the
[44:39] land of Egypt.
[44:41] blasphemy.
[44:44] So now 29 and he set the one in battle
[44:50] and the other put he in them
[44:54] and this thing became a sin. For the
[44:58] people went to worship before the one
[45:00] even unto then.
[45:03] So now
[45:06] let's go.
[45:08] This is like a complicated topic, but
[45:10] let's go to Revelation
[45:13] 7.
[45:16] I'm not a teacher. Brother Freddy,
[45:20] Brother Freddy was preaching really good
[45:22] last time.
[45:25] Revelation 73 saying,
[45:28] "Hart not the earth, neither the sea,
[45:31] nor the trees, till we have sealed the
[45:34] servants of our God in their foreheads.
[45:38] For I heard the number of them which
[45:41] were sealed, and there were sealed
[45:45] 144,000
[45:47] of all the tribes of Israel,
[45:51] children of Israel, and of the tribe of
[45:54] Judah were sealed 12,000.
[45:59] Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed
[46:02] 12,000. Of the tribe of God were sealed
[46:05] 12,000. and of the tribe of Acer were
[46:08] sealed 12,000. And of the tribe of Nef
[46:11] uh Neptaleim were sealed 12,000. And the
[46:15] tribe of Manasse were sealed 12,000. And
[46:17] the tribe of Simeon were sealed 12,000.
[46:21] And the tribe of Levi were sealed
[46:23] 12,000. And of the tribe of Isachar were
[46:26] sealed 12,000. And of the tribe of
[46:29] Sabulon were sealed 12,000. and of the
[46:32] tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000 and
[46:36] the tribe of Benjamin were sealed
[46:39] 12,000.
[46:40] Where's Dan and Ephraim?
[46:44] The Bible said God blotted their names
[46:49] under heaven because they worship
[46:54] gods.
[46:57] My brother,
[47:00] &gt;&gt; they were not there in the
[47:04] 144,000.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; But remember
[47:08] under heaven.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; So if you go to Ezekiel chapter 48
[47:16] that is millennium and you will see
[47:18] their names over there. But that's
[47:20] another topic. I will just pass by to
[47:23] this.
[47:24] So that's the danger of worshiping other
[47:28] gods.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Now in our days the prophet said if you
[47:34] spend more time to this that will be
[47:38] your god.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; If you spend time to your football that
[47:41] will be your god.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; If you spend time to your baseball that
[47:46] will be your god.
[47:50] Don't forget maybe you're not your name
[47:53] is not blotted out but there's a lamb
[47:56] book lamb's book of life and the book of
[47:58] life.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; So that's another topic. Let's go
[48:03] straight. So now Deuteronomy 28 uh
[48:06] 29:16.
[48:08] This is the warning of God to the 12
[48:10] tribes of Israel. He said,"For ye know
[48:14] how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt,
[48:16] and how we came through the nation which
[48:18] ye passed by, and ye have seen their
[48:21] abominations, and their idols, wood,
[48:24] stone, silver, and gold, which were
[48:26] among them. list there should be among
[48:29] you men or woman or family or tribe who
[48:35] whose heart turned away this day from
[48:39] the Lord our God to go and serve the
[48:42] gods of the nations least there should
[48:46] be among you a root that beareth
[48:50] gormwood
[48:52] and it came to pass when he heareth the
[48:55] words of this curse
[48:57] that he blessed himself in his heart,
[49:00] saying, I shall have peace. Do I walk in
[49:03] the imagination of my heart, to add
[49:06] drunkenness to thirst, the Lord will not
[49:10] spare him. But then the anger of the
[49:14] Lord and his jealousy shall smoke
[49:17] against
[49:19] that man, and all the curses that are
[49:24] written in the book shall lie upon him,
[49:27] and the Lord shall blot out his name
[49:30] from under heaven.
[49:34] That's why Dan and Ibraim, you cannot
[49:37] see them over there because they worship
[49:40] the gods of Jeroboam.
[49:44] Now, in Jeremiah 29,
[49:49] you know, the the children of Israel
[49:53] followed their parents.
[49:56] You see, Jehoa came, he killed Uriah the
[50:00] prophet.
[50:02] They persecuted the prophets. They won't
[50:05] listen to the message of the prophets.
[50:07] Instead, they put them in prison and
[50:10] killed them.
[50:12] So that's why Jeremiah
[50:15] started he was prophesying
[50:18] that he said
[50:20] um
[50:23] he said in uh Jeremiah 25
[50:29] and this whole land shall be desolation
[50:32] and astonishment
[50:34] and this nation shall shall serve the
[50:37] king of Babylon
[50:39] 70 years. That was the prophecy of
[50:43] Jeremiah. But after he prophesied,
[50:47] look at the grace of God.
[50:50] Brothers, yes, he will kick. Sometimes
[50:53] he will rebuke you. Sometimes he will
[50:56] spunk you. That's our God.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want to serve a God that will
[51:01] put you to loved every day.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; He will tell you that he you are my son.
[51:07] I will correct you if you're wrong.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; But then after the correction, like I I
[51:16] after I spunk Mary,
[51:20] I tell her that I love her. Why I spunk
[51:24] you? Because I love you.
[51:27] Mary will going to tell me later about
[51:29] that. So, but here was the message after
[51:34] he prophesied that they will go to to
[51:37] Israel or to Jerus or to uh Babylon. He
[51:41] said, "For thus said the Lord that after
[51:45] 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I
[51:48] will visit you and perform my good words
[51:54] towards you
[51:56] and causing you to return to this place.
[52:00] For I know the thoughts that I think
[52:03] toward you, said the Lord. Thoughts that
[52:07] of peace and not of evil.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; That's why I love my God.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Not of evil. Thoughts that of peace, not
[52:22] of evil, to give you an expected end.
[52:26] Then shall you call upon me, and ye
[52:29] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[52:32] hearken unto you,
[52:36] &gt;&gt; and ye shall seek me, and find me, when
[52:40] you shall search for me with all your
[52:43] heart.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Search me,
[52:48] &gt;&gt; you will find me.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Call upon me if you're sick. Call upon
[52:53] him if you're if you need him.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; If you're struggling, call upon him,
[53:00] Papa God.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] But then
[53:14] Genesis 11, Babylon means confusion.
[53:17] Brother Steven was preaching about that
[53:21] identity crisis. Brother Steven,
[53:25] Babylon,
[53:26] I went to the dictionary, it said a city
[53:29] devoted to a materialism
[53:32] and sensual pleasure.
[53:36] Now if you search
[53:39] the most before the most visited site
[53:45] before was the Bible.
[53:49] The Bible is not the most visited site
[53:51] anymore.
[53:53] The most visited site right now is
[53:56] pornography.
[53:59] And that because we're living in
[54:01] Babylon.
[54:04] Revelation 17
[54:09] and upon the forehead was name written a
[54:13] mystery Babylon the great the mother of
[54:15] harlots. So if if if the church the
[54:20] Catholic church is the mother of all of
[54:22] all harlots,
[54:25] she has daughters.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; And the daughters right now are the one
[54:32] that you will see. Every corner you will
[54:35] see cross, every corner you will see
[54:38] Jesus saves.
[54:43] But they
[54:46] worship God
[54:48] but they don't have the quality
[54:52] so that God don't answer their prayers.
[54:57] You know people I was I was searching
[54:59] that I love the song of the brother who
[55:03] was uh brother Steven.
[55:06] He was singing here last week.
[55:10] I was searching that song, brother,
[55:13] and I was I don't want to see the the
[55:16] the name the the guy that composed that
[55:18] song. Long hair, tattoos, and he was
[55:23] praying. He was singing. I don't have
[55:26] something in me, but all that I have is
[55:29] sing hallelujah to you.
[55:32] Don't look at that singer, brother.
[55:36] See they thought they can worship God
[55:41] &gt;&gt; but is it God listen to them?
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Peter the Bible said in first Peter I
[55:49] don't even hear your prayers.
[55:55] Now Daniel means God is my judge.
[56:00] That's the name of Daniel.
[56:03] Babylonian name is to protect the king.
[56:08] Belt Caesar is the the guardsman.
[56:13] Protector of the king.
[56:17] Hanana
[56:19] means Yahweh is gracious.
[56:23] But then they gave him a name,
[56:28] the God of the moon.
[56:33] And Asia Yahweh has helped.
[56:37] Mishak,
[56:39] God of the moon, also Mishael, who is
[56:43] like God.
[56:45] But then the Babylonian name Abednego,
[56:48] God of wisdom.
[56:52] So God the the the the
[56:55] Babylonian changed their name.
[56:59] I remember if I if you search
[57:03] the history of the Philippines
[57:07] when the Spaniard came to the
[57:09] Philippines,
[57:11] it was three that they were under by the
[57:14] Spaniard for 333 years. That's why my
[57:18] wife's name is Maria Chavez Corason
[57:20] Chavez
[57:23] because the Spaniard put the name tag to
[57:27] the Filipinos that we owned you. We will
[57:30] change your name,
[57:33] right? You can see that to the
[57:35] Congalles,
[57:37] you know, before the name of brother
[57:40] Jonathan is uh Mundu Matumbu.
[57:46] But then that was the original name of
[57:49] the Africans.
[57:52] But then when the French came
[57:55] they changed the name so that they will
[57:59] show to the to the to the other
[58:01] countries that I owned you.
[58:07] Now after in 1895
[58:13] the American invaded or or the American
[58:16] won the SpanishAmerican war.
[58:20] So now the Americans
[58:23] took care of the the the Philippines and
[58:27] now they started changing their names.
[58:31] Warren,
[58:36] brother Jonathan.
[58:38] So that will show who owns you,
[58:42] right?
[58:46] Patrick,
[58:50] Oliver,
[58:53] there's so many names that you can
[58:55] identify. Like if if I own the cattle,
[59:00] brother Jonathan, if you own the cattle,
[59:02] you put name
[59:05] behind the cattle, the the the the cow,
[59:07] right? On the side. So meaning to say if
[59:11] that cow will stray away
[59:14] and they will find the the the marks
[59:18] on the side, they say, "Oh, Peter
[59:22] owns that cow."
[59:26] And that's what the the the Babylonians
[59:28] did to the children of Israel.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; I will change your name so that we can
[59:34] own you.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; I told you before that when I became a
[59:43] citizen,
[59:45] I want to change my name
[59:48] to Peter Parker.
[59:52] So I went to I went to Tennessee last
[59:55] May
[59:57] and here was
[59:59] Josiah Brown.
[1:00:01] He said, "Brother Warren, Brother
[1:00:03] Warren." And it seems like he knows me,
[1:00:06] brother. And I I I said, "I don't know
[1:00:09] this guy."
[1:00:11] And uh you know, to show that you know
[1:00:13] him, too, you say, "Oh, yeah. Good to
[1:00:15] see you. Are are you are are you
[1:00:17] visiting here?" No, he said we're we're
[1:00:19] here. We we're from here. My dad is Joel
[1:00:22] Brown. Oh, yeah. I know the preacher. He
[1:00:26] said, "Yeah." "Oh, brother, I know you."
[1:00:29] Why? Why you know me? Because you were
[1:00:33] preaching about Peter Parker.
[1:00:37] And I said, "So, do you follow me?" He
[1:00:40] said, "Yeah, I I watch I watch your
[1:00:43] preaching."
[1:00:45] But the favorite thing that he can
[1:00:48] connect to me was the Peter Parker name.
[1:00:53] So I want to change my name
[1:00:57] because my kids keep telling me you your
[1:01:00] name is Warren Banana Arcola.
[1:01:04] And so I was like, I need to change
[1:01:06] this. I need to change this. I need to
[1:01:08] change it. And when I found out that
[1:01:11] Peter Parker was a Spider-Man,
[1:01:15] I said, I I'm I'm okay with Warren.
[1:01:23] So,
[1:01:25] you know, your Babylonian name
[1:01:28] is your name right now,
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; you know, in in like uh Jonathan.
[1:01:36] Well, my parents are believers. And you
[1:01:38] say you uh that's a Babylonian name. All
[1:01:42] the names that give it to you here are
[1:01:46] not your original name.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; But then when you become born again,
[1:01:55] you recognize your position in Christ.
[1:02:00] Then God changed you to a Christian,
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; to an eagle,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; to to to uh now your name before,
[1:02:09] brother Brandham said, your name before
[1:02:11] was Elvis.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Your name before was Ricky.
[1:02:17] And say, but how about the Christian
[1:02:19] names? Oh, yeah. Brother Paul, go to
[1:02:22] Mexico. Their names are Pedro, Huan, and
[1:02:26] Jesus.
[1:02:29] and they're drunkards. Jesus means Jesus
[1:02:35] and some of them are cartel members.
[1:02:38] So you don't the name here
[1:02:42] that we have is the Babylonian name.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; But then once you
[1:02:50] Oh, it's get deeper and deeper, brother.
[1:02:54] Once you overcome,
[1:02:57] the Bible said in Revelation chapter
[1:02:59] 2:17, "He that had an ear, let him hear
[1:03:03] what the spirit said unto the churches.
[1:03:05] To him that overcomemeth will I give to
[1:03:09] eat of hidden mana,
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; and I will give him a white stone."
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in that stone a new name
[1:03:18] written,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; which no man know it, saving he that
[1:03:23] receive it.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Now don't ask me about my new name,
[1:03:28] because only me knows that.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; But I will get that new name over there.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I will sit in my father's throne.
[1:03:44] The prophet said in the message
[1:03:45] exposition of the seven church sages, it
[1:03:48] also says
[1:03:50] here that he's going to give the
[1:03:52] overcomer a white stone
[1:03:56] and in uh the stone a new name which the
[1:04:01] o the owner only knows.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Don't don't go to the preachers in the
[1:04:08] Philippines. They know that already.
[1:04:12] So now he said the owner only knows. Now
[1:04:17] the idea of a few names is familiar one.
[1:04:22] Abram was changed to Abraham,
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Sarai to Sarah, Jacob to Israel, Simon
[1:04:30] to Peter, and Saul to Paul. These names
[1:04:34] either brought out a change or were
[1:04:37] given because of a change. It was only
[1:04:41] after Abraham and Sarai or Abraham and
[1:04:45] Sarai had their names changed by the
[1:04:49] Lord that they were made ready to
[1:04:52] receive
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; the the coming son.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; In Jacob's case, he had to overcome and
[1:05:00] then he was called a prince.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; From the deceiver to prince, from mama's
[1:05:06] boy to prince.
[1:05:09] My
[1:05:11] in the case of Simon and Saul when they
[1:05:15] had received the Lord their chain their
[1:05:18] their name their chains came and today
[1:05:21] each one of us true believers has had
[1:05:26] chains in name.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; My
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; now we are Christians. It is a name
[1:05:34] common to all of us. But one day we will
[1:05:39] have another change.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; We will of a certain receive a new name.
[1:05:47] It could will be that name was our true
[1:05:50] and original name written in the lamb's
[1:05:52] book of life from the foundation of the
[1:05:56] world. He knows the same that name but
[1:05:59] we do not.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. One day
[1:06:04] at his good picture
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; we will know also
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; I will have a new name.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Because you tell me brother I am an
[1:06:16] overcomer.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. You you you don't see me in my
[1:06:22] work. You don't see me in my house.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; But I can tell you I am an overcomer.
[1:06:31] We are an overcomer
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; because he overcame first.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Now the husband said you don't do
[1:06:39] anything. All you do is just believe.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Go to church and worship me.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And fight a good fight of faith.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Food are very important in our body.
[1:06:57] Appetite means a natural desire to
[1:07:01] satisfy a bodily bodily need especially
[1:07:04] for food.
[1:07:06] Now many of you heard this. You are what
[1:07:10] you eat.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Don't you know gluttony before is a sin.
[1:07:17] Wow. We don't hear that preaching
[1:07:19] anymore, brother.
[1:07:23] But gluttony
[1:07:26] is a sin.
[1:07:28] You know the prophet said the the Paul
[1:07:30] said you know they're after is their own
[1:07:33] belly.
[1:07:39] Now
[1:07:41] what you see
[1:07:44] is feeding you
[1:07:48] right? If you see
[1:07:51] a good thing,
[1:07:54] you're feeding your soul.
[1:07:58] If you hear something,
[1:08:01] what do you hear? Young people,
[1:08:05] please check your apps.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; What you listened,
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:14] You're feeding your soul what you hear,
[1:08:17] what you see.
[1:08:20] And it will affect your body.
[1:08:25] Why? You see sometimes girls with
[1:08:27] earrings, with purple hair,
[1:08:31] with all black clothes, because they
[1:08:34] seize that.
[1:08:36] They saw that somewhere.
[1:08:43] I have a picture before and after. Do
[1:08:45] you have that? Uh, brother Ethan,
[1:08:56] my you see this all over the if you go
[1:09:00] to your mailbox, you open your mailbox,
[1:09:04] there are like newspaper advertisement
[1:09:09] that this kind of diet you will eat and
[1:09:12] you will become like this before and
[1:09:14] after there are those people are not AI
[1:09:20] they're true and you know what kind of
[1:09:23] food they eat
[1:09:26] they will let you buy a a small pack
[1:09:29] every day so you will eat it three times
[1:09:32] a day
[1:09:34] but when I tried that one it tastes like
[1:09:37] brother
[1:09:39] no appetite will you don't have you will
[1:09:43] not going to like it,
[1:09:46] brother. It's better the the the good
[1:09:49] one, right? The um the chicken and the
[1:09:55] and the tortilla
[1:09:58] and the burrito,
[1:10:02] but it will affect your body. If you're
[1:10:06] eating right,
[1:10:09] it will affect your body. You know, in
[1:10:11] in Mexico, I am a missionary to Mexico.
[1:10:15] Most of the people that comes to the
[1:10:17] altar for prayer, they want me to pray
[1:10:20] for their diabetes,
[1:10:22] their diabetic.
[1:10:25] And I I asked them after we prayed, I
[1:10:29] asked the brothers, can we talk about,
[1:10:33] you know, we need to Yes, God will heal
[1:10:35] you, but please
[1:10:38] cocoa is so be it's sweeter. They said
[1:10:41] it's sweeter than the United States
[1:10:43] cocoa. Coca means Coca-Cola.
[1:10:48] So they keep drinking CocaCola.
[1:10:51] So I told them please don't drink soft
[1:10:55] drinks.
[1:10:57] Then it will reduce your blood sugar.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; So not only we're feeding them
[1:11:04] spiritually but they're we're helping
[1:11:07] them naturally
[1:11:11] now. They will call me the the
[1:11:15] um what do you call that? uh
[1:11:19] uh the dietician.
[1:11:24] So
[1:11:26] you listen, the prophet said here, this
[1:11:28] is a good one. I was um reading this and
[1:11:32] I was like ready to share this to you.
[1:11:35] It said here,
[1:11:38] every beautiful type of a born-again
[1:11:40] Christian cannot digest the things of
[1:11:43] the world cuz if they do, it will
[1:11:47] spiritually kill them right away.
[1:11:54] But did you ever notice the old crow?
[1:11:59] Now he can sit on the dead carcass.
[1:12:02] That's the decaying in plain Kentucky
[1:12:04] language, patting. And it can sit on
[1:12:09] there and just eat all day long, but the
[1:12:13] dove cannot go around it. It strikes and
[1:12:17] she will fly away. But the crow uh the
[1:12:21] crow can sit on there and eat all day
[1:12:25] long and then it can go right out in the
[1:12:29] wheat field and eat with the dove too.
[1:12:34] So a hypocrite, an impostor, he can go
[1:12:38] to the world and
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; affiliated with the world
[1:12:43] and act like the world and live in the
[1:12:46] world and enjoy the pleasure
[1:12:52] tend to be a Christian.
[1:12:55] But the real Christian can't where is
[1:12:58] it?
[1:13:00] The real Christian
[1:13:03] can go out to the world and come back.
[1:13:07] There's something wrong. So that shows
[1:13:10] you your company.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; I will tell you who you are.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Show me your friend
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; and I will tell you who you are. Right.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron one time told me he said,
[1:13:26] "Brother Warren, I I was telling him
[1:13:27] that the the a pickle ball group here in
[1:13:31] the church, the young people." So he
[1:13:33] said, "That's good because if you don't
[1:13:35] let them join with the young people,
[1:13:38] they will look somewhere a friend.
[1:13:43] So show me your company and I will tell
[1:13:45] you who you are. Show me your friend, I
[1:13:47] will tell you who you are."
[1:13:49] There's so many There's so many
[1:13:51] believers here. Make friends with the
[1:13:53] believers.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:13:59] let me go to your house and see what you
[1:14:01] read. Let me listen,
[1:14:04] what you feed, what kind of music you
[1:14:08] are playing. Let me see what kind of
[1:14:10] magazines, what kind of literature you
[1:14:12] read.
[1:14:14] Let me look into your office and see
[1:14:18] it's a big bunch of these vulgar
[1:14:20] pictures or this app uh apps and things
[1:14:25] and you and I and you will tell me
[1:14:28] you're a Christian. I won't say nothing
[1:14:30] to you, but in my heart I will watch
[1:14:34] what kind of fruit you're feeding, what
[1:14:36] kind of food you eat.
[1:14:39] Amen.
[1:14:42] Now,
[1:14:45] here's the the two children, the the the
[1:14:49] sons of uh Isaac, Jacob and Esau,
[1:14:55] you know, would say, well, food is
[1:14:57] nothing. It's only a food. I will not
[1:15:00] deceive by food.
[1:15:02] But here's in Genesis chapter 25:29.
[1:15:07] And Jacob saw pottage or pottage.
[1:15:12] And Esau came from the field and he was
[1:15:16] faint.
[1:15:18] And Esau said to Jacob, "Feed me, I pray
[1:15:21] thee, with that same red pottage, for I
[1:15:25] am faint." Therefore was this name
[1:15:28] called Edom. And Jacob said, "Sell me
[1:15:32] this day thy birthright."
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Mama's boy, but wise.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Sell me your birthright. I'll feed you.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Well, um um Esau said,
[1:15:48] "Behold, I am at that point to die, and
[1:15:53] what profit shall this birthright to do
[1:15:56] me?" See the difference of the believers
[1:15:59] and the non-believers,
[1:16:02] they doesn't care. They're God-given
[1:16:05] right.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; They can sell that to the world. The
[1:16:11] prophet said, "Elvis, look at Elvis. He
[1:16:14] was a very God was using him to sing in
[1:16:18] the church.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; How great thou art.
[1:16:23] How great thou art." And everybody was
[1:16:26] clapping. Everybody was happy. The
[1:16:29] anointing in the room, you can feel it.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; But then the prophet said he sold his
[1:16:36] birthright because of money.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Where's brother John? He was singing
[1:16:42] pause me not, oh gentle save you.
[1:16:47] He was singing that last Sunday. And you
[1:16:50] know who was singing that? the blind
[1:16:52] woman Crosby,
[1:16:55] they offered her millions of dollars
[1:17:00] to to sing to the world.
[1:17:03] But you know what she did? What she say
[1:17:05] what she told to the to the
[1:17:08] um record something. She said, "I'd
[1:17:12] rather sing to my savior
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; than to sing to the world."
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; my brother. But Esau did not recognize
[1:17:24] the power of birthright.
[1:17:28] So he said, "And Jacob said, swear to me
[1:17:32] this day, and swear unto him." And he
[1:17:36] sold his birthright unto Jacob. Then
[1:17:39] Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage in
[1:17:43] lentil or lentil lentiles. And he did
[1:17:47] eat and drink
[1:17:50] and rose up and went his way. And Esau
[1:17:53] despised his birthright.
[1:17:57] Supposed to be Esau was the prince.
[1:18:02] But because he sold it to Jacob, the
[1:18:05] mama's boy became prince.
[1:18:08] became Israel
[1:18:10] and his name is up to now known all over
[1:18:13] the world
[1:18:15] because
[1:18:16] he got the birthright.
[1:18:19] Now in Amos chapter, you know, uh 8, it
[1:18:23] said, "Behold, the days come that there
[1:18:26] will be a famine in the land, but not
[1:18:29] for food or for drinks,
[1:18:32] but of the word of God."
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; there will be a famine in the land. When
[1:18:38] is that coming, brother?
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; I I found this today.
[1:18:45] How much food is wasted in America?
[1:18:49] Well, this is 2025. It said here just
[1:18:53] how much food do American waste? Here's
[1:18:58] some food for to forought.
[1:19:00] While the world waste
[1:19:04] about 2.5 billion tons of food every
[1:19:07] year, 2.5 billions.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; The United States discard more food than
[1:19:19] any other country in the world. Nearly
[1:19:23] 60 million tons,
[1:19:26] 120 billion pounds every year.
[1:19:30] There's no famine in America, brother.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Now, the estimated to be almost 40%
[1:19:41] of the entire
[1:19:44] US food supply
[1:19:47] and equates to 325 pounds of waste per
[1:19:51] person.
[1:19:54] That's a lot of food, brother. You're
[1:19:57] counted here.
[1:19:59] per person. 225 pounds of waste per
[1:20:03] person into the garbage or rather right
[1:20:07] into landfill
[1:20:09] as mo most discarded food ends up there.
[1:20:14] In fact, food is the single largest
[1:20:17] component taking up space inside US
[1:20:20] landfills making up to 22% of municipal
[1:20:25] solid waste.
[1:20:27] All told, the amount of food wasted in
[1:20:31] America has approximately value nearly
[1:20:35] 28 billion.
[1:20:38] The quant uh equivalent of
[1:20:42] 130 billion meals.
[1:20:47] There's no famine in the United States.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; But what is the famine? The word of God.
[1:20:53] Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; You go to work, don't you ever talk
[1:20:59] about religion.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever talk to them about
[1:21:04] Christ?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Because they said there will be no end
[1:21:08] if you talk about Christ.
[1:21:12] There's a famine in the land,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; but not of food or water. But in Matthew
[1:21:19] chapter 4, he said,
[1:21:23] you know, the the the Bible said, um,
[1:21:26] man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:21:29] by every word that proceedth out of the
[1:21:32] mouth of God.
[1:21:35] So every Christians
[1:21:38] cannot live without the word of God
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; because the word of God is their lives.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; It's my life. It's your life.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:47] Amen.
[1:21:50] There was a story in the Bible
[1:21:54] when when Elijah
[1:21:59] in uh brother Freddy was mentioning this
[1:22:02] one time uh in his preaching, you know,
[1:22:05] when when Jezebel was uh when he was
[1:22:09] speaking to Jezebel,
[1:22:11] he was so powerful
[1:22:14] and he wasn't uh scared of Jezebel. But
[1:22:18] when the spirit of the Lord came out
[1:22:20] from him, he was running.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; He was scared. So now Elijah was was
[1:22:28] sitting in juniper tree.
[1:22:32] But then God always there for him. So
[1:22:37] now God send a an angel to feed him.
[1:22:44] I love this message, brother. The
[1:22:47] message is a sustaining strength to us
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; when we are down. The angel will come
[1:22:53] and feed us.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; The angel that follows you and the angel
[1:22:58] from the pulpit
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; we get fed every day the strong meat.
[1:23:06] Now Elijah when he was and when they uh
[1:23:09] and and behold there was a cake bake on
[1:23:13] the coals and a cru of water at his
[1:23:16] head. And he did eat and drink and laid
[1:23:21] him down again. And the angel of the
[1:23:23] Lord came again the second time and
[1:23:27] touched him and said, "Arise
[1:23:30] and eat because the journey is too too
[1:23:33] great for thee." And he arose and did
[1:23:37] eat and drink and went in the straight
[1:23:40] of that meat 40 days.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; What kind of food? What kind of food did
[1:23:48] he eat?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Angel's food.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; The sustaining strength.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; And the sustaining strength is in in our
[1:23:57] time right now is the message of the
[1:23:59] hour.
[1:24:01] Yes.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; 40 days and 40 nights
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; without hunger, brother.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And he went in the straight of those
[1:24:15] cakes for 40 days.
[1:24:17] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:24:19] today, and forever.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; If he can do that to Elijah,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Elijah is a man like us. And when Elijah
[1:24:28] prayed, God heared his prayers. Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; My brother,
[1:24:35] don't you underestimate this is the
[1:24:37] word, but if you believe it, it's power.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; It's donamous.
[1:24:46] Now, the prophet said
[1:24:48] in the message, spiritual food in due
[1:24:51] season, it's not their food. It's not
[1:24:55] the church so-called food in its bride
[1:24:59] bride. It it's it's the bride's food.
[1:25:02] It's spiritual food in season.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; It would make them sick if they're in at
[1:25:09] their stomach. It's too rich for them.
[1:25:13] See, you can do it. But for the
[1:25:16] children, it's a bread. It's a life.
[1:25:19] It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:25:22] today, and forever.
[1:25:23] to the nominal churches brother that's
[1:25:27] too much for them
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; they cannot swallow that food
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; because the food only for the children
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; he is a sustaining power
[1:25:41] almost time my
[1:25:46] now the prophet said what he would
[1:25:50] however ever
[1:25:52] over and us and nourish us and would
[1:25:56] give us today our daily bread both
[1:25:59] physical and spiritual
[1:26:02] that we might have the sustaining
[1:26:04] strength of body to walk about upon the
[1:26:07] earth and the sustaining power of the
[1:26:10] Holy Spirit to bring the word of God to
[1:26:14] a hungry people.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; How many of you are hungry tonight?
[1:26:18] Then God will sustain us.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You know the song said, "Fill me." Well,
[1:26:26] it's I'm full, but let me let me ask one
[1:26:30] more. Fill me.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Let my oil overflow.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not satisfied that I have a full
[1:26:40] oil, brother. I want my oil overflowing
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; from head to toe. That's what we want.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; My now God called Elijah to sustain the
[1:26:58] widow. The widow is type of the bride.
[1:27:02] The widow he her first husband was dead.
[1:27:06] And our first husband is dead. Satan is
[1:27:09] dead to us. Now here comes the prophet
[1:27:12] Elijah
[1:27:14] to come and sustain you.
[1:27:17] with this with this sustaining power.
[1:27:20] Brothers and sisters,
[1:27:22] you know what is the Holy Ghost? The
[1:27:24] Holy Ghost is the word in your hour.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; God called Elijah to sustain this widow.
[1:27:35] They just had one little cake, one
[1:27:39] little thing she was holding on to. And
[1:27:42] Elijah said, "Give that to me."
[1:27:45] That was a command, brother Freddy. Give
[1:27:47] that to me.
[1:27:49] Give that to me first. For thus said the
[1:27:52] Lord, that barrel will not go empty.
[1:27:55] Neither will the cruise dry run dry
[1:27:58] until the day that the Lord God sends
[1:28:02] rain upon the earth. Putting God first,
[1:28:06] his word first,
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; then God will sustain you.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:15] Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; I will skip because it's almost time. I
[1:28:19] have more to share. Okay. It said the
[1:28:23] Bible or the the prophet said here.
[1:28:27] He said, "Father, this is his prayer.
[1:28:32] Father,
[1:28:34] so it is today the church, the true
[1:28:38] believer, the body of believers has
[1:28:42] access to food,
[1:28:45] spiritual food that the nominal knows
[1:28:48] nothing about. The world knows nothing
[1:28:51] of this food, Father, but your church,
[1:28:54] your people, the bride of your uh your
[1:28:57] son loves it.
[1:28:59] We have access to healing to our bodies.
[1:29:03] When the doctor has failed, we have
[1:29:06] access to this. It's one of food of God
[1:29:12] that he gave to his church and promise
[1:29:15] it in the last days to this believing
[1:29:19] children. Father, help us to be
[1:29:21] believing children. For all things are
[1:29:25] possible to them that believes to the
[1:29:28] believers. Grant it dear father, dear
[1:29:31] God. We ask it in Jesus name.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] One of the message said, "Oh God, give
[1:29:40] us like Daniel,
[1:29:42] give us Christian like Shadrach,
[1:29:45] like Mishak,
[1:29:47] like Abednego
[1:29:50] that in the middle of of we call that I
[1:29:54] maybe if if I can type that Babylon,
[1:29:59] you're in middle of New York."
[1:30:02] in in the middle of New York, there are
[1:30:05] like different kinds of characters,
[1:30:08] Rambo, Mickey Mouse, and Donald Duck.
[1:30:12] And they will come to take picture of
[1:30:13] you, but then you will pay them. They
[1:30:16] will go after you. He said, "I didn't
[1:30:19] take a picture with you, but you did.
[1:30:21] Here's your picture.
[1:30:24] It's filthy. you go to the train
[1:30:27] station.
[1:30:30] But for 70 years,
[1:30:34] they were faithful
[1:30:36] because you know why? Because they have
[1:30:39] a sustaining strength.
[1:30:41] They have the word. What's was the word?
[1:30:45] The word of Jeremiah that after 70
[1:30:48] years, I will bring you back to your
[1:30:51] homeland.
[1:30:54] Brothers and sisters,
[1:30:56] this message, well, it's it's more than
[1:31:01] 60 years now.
[1:31:06] But are you still okay? To me, brothers,
[1:31:11] I am okay because I have a s sustaining
[1:31:14] food. I have a sustaining power in me.
[1:31:18] I have the word
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; that the prophet said, "You walk, you
[1:31:23] run because one day the rapture will
[1:31:27] come."
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Don't you, the prophet said, "Please
[1:31:33] don't you ever
[1:31:37] uh to be there in that uh great
[1:31:39] tribulation
[1:31:41] because you know why? You cannot buy,
[1:31:44] you cannot sell without the mark. You
[1:31:47] cannot buy to satisfy your needs. That's
[1:31:51] why the prophet said, "Don't you ever go
[1:31:54] there.
[1:31:56] Whatever you do, my goal is the
[1:31:59] rapture."
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Whatever we do, I need to eat food.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; But the pulse, what is the pulse? the
[1:32:07] vegetables that Daniels eat, you know,
[1:32:10] it's something that that too too little
[1:32:14] to the people because the food of the
[1:32:16] kings
[1:32:18] are fried chicken and sirloins and
[1:32:22] pammenion
[1:32:24] but to Daniel
[1:32:28] just corn beans
[1:32:31] water
[1:32:34] but there's power there's power In that
[1:32:37] message, the power of the word
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; this something to them they they said if
[1:32:41] you look at the message the Google they
[1:32:44] said the prophet is an illiterate but
[1:32:47] that illiterate man satisfy my need.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; That illiterate man called us
[1:32:55] from from uh
[1:32:58] where you from brother Stephen
[1:33:00] uh Ireland from the Philippines from
[1:33:03] Congo from different countries.
[1:33:07] gathered us together
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; to come here to eat the food.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, taste and see
[1:33:18] if the musician can come. I am ready to
[1:33:21] sing.
[1:33:24] Oh, come and see. Or what is that,
[1:33:26] brother Jonathan? You know that song,
[1:33:28] right?
[1:33:33] That's the food. The food of this hour
[1:33:35] is the message of the hour.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank
[1:33:39] you, Lord.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the sustaining power.
[1:33:44] Father, thank you for the sustaining
[1:33:46] strength.
[1:33:49] It's almost there.
[1:33:52] Maybe a a short mile to
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:33:57] Father,
