brother Mario come up here the Ministries that we have within our church are Ministries that are a help to me and to all of you I rely upon these men I believe that God is using their Ministries maturing their Ministries to that you might help to be able to feed the Bride of Jesus Christ and so I bless all of them that are here that Minister Among Us and may the Lord bless them abundantly is my prayer God bless you brother Mario speak what's on your heart please amen uh God bless you Saints bless you amen so we're so glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight this will be the last uh day before the new year so I will not bring uh uh uh long sermons tonight I I will give my extra time to some of the young Minister's brother for encouragement but what I would like to do is uh to appreciate our pastor brother Ron that's right and uh time go also F that uh I am under his ministry now for 17 years and he been an Inspirations to me to stand on the word never compromise but just stay humble and grow by grace in the Lord as he grows I grows with him so we just appreciate you brother Ron and also our uh fellow ministers who put their shoulder on the wheel that that uh we are so happy to see the church grow in the grace of God Amen even the young people are growing our young ministers is growing and I'm really glad that uh brother Ron already put in transition the church so whatever happens in the near future our congregation is already established in the word of God thank you so our our young people are already sure that they'll will be a good leadership in case that the Lord is finished with us uh as we grow older so there are young ministers coming that also under the ministry of Baron that stand true to the word of God so if God's t uh we will have grandchildren or something that but our grandchild will be sure they under the good Ministry amen so let us stand by God's grace I will just uh say a few words of encouragement or exhortations let's bow our head Heavenly Father we are so grateful tonight Lord that we are in your presence we're so thankful of the things that you have done for us Lord this all these years Lord God you never fail us Lord sometimes we fail and sometimes we fall we have discouragement but it was your grace that lift us up Lord give us hope us courage which give us Lord victories and we thank you tonight Lord that you are we are a living testimonies of your grace once again be with us as we have Fellowship around your word Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen so let us uh turn directly to the word of God in the Book of Revelation Revelation chapter 2 verse 25 this is a three portion of scripture revelation 225 Revelation 3 3 and Revelation 3:1 Revelations 2:25 it says but that which he have already hold fast till I come amen amen we know that the Believers of that age died holding the truth that they had received for that age and they are still holding it right now in a different place or the other dimension amen and we realize that only that only change the dwelling place but it doesn't change what you believe so hold fast Revelation 3 chapter 3 remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard you have received the word you have heard the word and hold fast amen so we'll jump to Revelation 3:1 behold I come quickly yes sir hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown so we will notice again in each of these ages hold fast hold fast hold fast amen the truth that you have received for your age hold fast to that till he come may the Lord add a blessing upon his weding word you may be seated so I would like to take this short sermon in Revelation chap 225 as my title behold that which ye have already hold fast till I come amen hold fast till I come so it is the word of encouragement for us for this new year to let these things sleep of what is most important sleep from us by the destructions of this age as the prophet said whatever we do do right now whatever situation or do or what we are doing right now as the prophet said we just need to keep carrying on till he comes that's right so it's our duty to keep carrying on until he comes amen so the word that he's given us we need to hold unto it till he comes that's right because as the Believers of this hour we are at once against the age of unbelief of what Satan is trying to take from us of the truth of what God has rightfully given to us in this hour we are in the the Satan's Eden once again andone has bombarded us of all things of kind of uh things that take away our belief so that is why just like Daniel when he was under the Babylon he saw all these things under Babylon so he purposes in heart that he will not defile himself with the king's portions and we know that we are once again in the modern Babylon so and that is why that's like David and them in babyon we must purpose also in our heart to carry on at our post of Duty serving the lord amen serving the lord hearing his word reading his word we need to purpose it in our heart because the more we hear the word of God the more we are encouraged and the more we are encouraged the more we become the word we need to have a purpose in life in this last days because if you don't know your purpose life is meaningless but God called us for a certain purpose and that is to manifest his word in these last days thank you Lord that's why the prophet said the very powerful statement we are just living here once as a moral after this we will be stepping into immortality so we need to hold fast to what we have received amen serving God as much as possible let us not turn to the life or to the left let us Focus serving the lord what uh reading his word and feeding our souls in the revelation of this hour and serving one another in love amen and not to get weary in well doing but to keep carrying on until he comes as the prophet told us so by God's grace that is what I have purposed also in my heart this coming year 2025 hold fast to the word that we have received and never compromise I know there's a lot of bombardment on every side but we have seen already the reveal word of the hour knowing that whatever comes in this 2025 or whatever 2025 brings we will trust in the Lord being sure of this one thing that he will work all things out for our good we will when we will come to the end over Road thank you Lord because if we fall if we fail and sometimes we fall and we fail and we got discouraged because we are under this fles amen but one thing is sure when the spirit of the enemy come in like a flood his spirit will raise up a standard against it thank so whatever comes this 2025 whatever the Satan's bombarding make sure that is the spirit of God that will raise us up as a standard so let us not worry let us Trust on the Lord the more we trust on the Lord amen the more he can manifest himself God he will give us strength he will give us hope he will give us encourage and victories so don't worry about what is going to happen by next year I know there will be something happening by 2025 and if we base it according to the Scripture it will it will be getting worse and worse but for the Bride of Jesus Christ God will give us more understanding of his will in these last days amen because in Jeremiah 29:1 he said for I know the thought that I think towards you he knows about you he knows our struggle he knows of our walk and he knows everything said the Lord thoughts of peace and not of able to give you an unexpected end so that's why in Isaiah first Thessalonian 5:21 prove all things and hold fast that which is good amen to hold fast means to attend carefully so we me needed to take care of this word careful in our life to take care of and and to not discard or let go to keep carefully and faithfully and to continue to hold to retain and to guard so we are commanded by the scriptures to be faithful stewards of these Mysteries hold fast that which is good so this truth that we have been given by this message that has come into US is about the only thing in this age that we can TR called good that is the only good thing because the scripture as it was in the days of Noah all the thoughts of men are evil continually that's true but we H the sure word of the promise and that is good and we can find rest in the word of God because everything that happened here is already settled in heaven thank you Lord we just need to believe amen and so to hold fast to the message of this hour we must first have a good understanding of its truth we need the truth and you can ask how do we know the truth brother Mario well the truth will produce life yes it will Hallelujah because the Lord Jesus Christ I am the way he is not only the way he did three things I am the way I am the truth and I am the life that's right if you have if you need salvation Jesus Christ is the way if you need repentance Jesus Christ is the way if you need encouragement Jesus is the way and everybody knows the way even denomination knows the way to Jesus Christ they know to salvation but Jesus said not only the way is not enough to know the way to Jesus Christ not enough you need to be in the truth and some have know the way and they have the truth but they don't have life but this life is not just a church life you may know the way you may do the truth and you can have a church life you can go to church Sunday Wednesday pay your T by your offering but this life means the eternal life the life of Christ within us hallelujah so when we know that we are in truth because the life is being made manifest not the church life but the Life of Christ in you and when the life Christ in you you become his coworker and you will always represent you will become priest and king and a priest always represent the people to God we become a priest so we become we we we will become we stand in the gap you know when some of the brothers fall or fail we stand in the Gap and present it to God that is eternal life living for others amen you don't need to to bring food or you know your prayer alone will eat those people and you present it to God and when you pray to God God will answer it because when you pray in the name of Jesus Christ it's just like like Dy speaking pray to your brother yes sir don't discourage if you know that they fall just pray and God will listen to you because it was the Life of Christ in you amen because God so loved the word that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him should not perish but have etern life so hold fast it is very important the revelation of this hour is made clear to you by the sealing of the Holy Spirit into our mind and heart not only in our heart in the mind but also in our heart that is what we are striving as a minister I am not a pastor I am just a Helper but it's in my heart to see the people of God established in the word of God thank you Lord even though how small the gift God bestowed upon me I will say it without any fear or fav and when I see the people response to the word of God that's good enough for me I am just doing my portion that we that is what we are striving me striving as a minister to get the elect of God anchored deep on the things of Eternal value and to hold fast unto them until he comes even if we die before the Rapture happened it makes no difference that's right we need to establish the word of God Amen we we we we we we don't really uh as for me I don't really ask for any position because I know the gift of God in my heart so whatever he wants me to do I'll just do it am I don't want to become an international evangelist or whatsoever I am just a local Minister just preaching whatever God puts in my heart as a helper in this church church amen I I I I'm I'm trusting that we are in I believe that we are on this same Journey we need to pray for one another that's why I always told my wife if the minister had a love in his heart he will go deeper to the word of God and Fe the church amen because even young people need a deep things of God sir we don't need lullabi because we are under the anointing of an eagle which is the anointing of a revelation so as an iglet the mother Eagle always fed his eaglet solid meat they don't drink milk because it will upset their stomach they don't eat rotten meat it will upset them and maybe kill them but they are being fed by fresh meat they don't know anything just eating meat eating meat eating meat prise and they didn't realize that their feather is growing as they eat meat their feather is growing they're growing and they're growing and they're growing then why by they can fly by themselves and they can't find the word or the Press meat by themselves that's why as an elect of God we're not being lullabi by any words of denominations am we need solid meat IR regardless of anybody will reject it they will be hurt but we need to speak the truth so hold fast as Hebrews chapter 4 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is pass unto Heaven Jesus the son of God let us hold fast unto our profession and Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption when you are sealed you cannot be unsealed because you are sealed until the day of your Redemption that is our consolation because when you receive the Holy Spirit you can grieve it sometimes but that seal cannot be unsealed prise you are sealed until the day of redemption so by this 2025 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tend the hurter forgiving one another even as God for Christ sake had forgiven you in these years alone we have so many hurt aches and sometime the most uh one that give you hurt aches is uh sometimes your your your relatives your friends and sometimes it hurt it so much but I always told my family never hold grudges that's true amen make sure that your our heart is clean and pure never hold bitterness or grudges because if we are looking for the coming of the lord we need to have a Clean Heart amen so hold fast to them so I will just close this one so I hope it will just encourage us as brother Bram said now beginning the new year I want to say not happy New Year to you I want to say this to you God bless you and if he does that that's all you have need of for this coming year that's right and I trust that he will because when God bless us He blesses everything good health good family everything that you think about if you believe it and accept it God will bless you that's why I I I told the last uh Services you can invite me in any party wedding party birthday party celebration party but not P party we have enough of Peter party we have the sure Word of Promise in this last days as the prophet said in the message super sense my desire in this life and for this new year coming is more faith in God God take away any doubt that's in my heart and my mind if there should ever arise one Satan fights at me he fights at you he tries to shoot his arrows but may I have the shield of Faith always before me to withstand the Ws of the devil knock off his fire dark is my sincere prayer God bless you amen amen let's stand and sing hold to God's unchanging hand he said hold on hold fast several scriptures he read five or six scriptures hold fast and hold on time is filled with swift transition brother John Duncan if you get ready to sing brother John not ofth can stand but feel your hopes all things etern and hold to God's unchanging hand I've going to hold to God's unchanging [Music] hand and hold to God unchanging hand and your hopes all things [Music] ET third verse Oh to God's unchanging hand and not this world's made riches than that so rapidly Decay but seeks again seek the gain of heavenly TR and they will never pass away hold the god God's unchanging hand and to God unchanging hand to God [Music] unchanging God changing hand amen God bless you you can have your seat brother James love off you'll get ready to come up right after he sings today ministers if you'll please use this mic here we'll leave it sitting here so they'll be able to have that right away ready for you Lord bless you brother John as you sing tonight thank you amen God bless you tonight amen praise the Lord amen on my such a god-honoring song He's certainly worthy of amen amen the goodness of God Amen than I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me all my days I've been held in your [Music] hand from the moment that I wake up when I lay my hand oh I will sing of the goodness of God all my life you have been faithful in all my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am able oh I will see of the goodness of God I love your voice you have led me through the [Music] fire in darkest nights you are close like no other I've known you as a father I've known you as a friend and and I have Liv in the goodness of God cuz all my life you have been faithful and all my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am in oh I will see of the goodness of [Music] God your goodness is running after it's running after me your goodness is running after it's running after me with my life laid down I Surrender now I give you everything oh lord your goodness is running after it's running after me your goodness is running after it's running after me your goodness is running after it's running after me with my life laid down I Surrender now I give you everything your goodness is running after it's running after [Music] me cuz all my life you have been faithful thank you Lord and all my life you you have been so so good with every breath that I am able oh I will sing of the goodness of God I will sing of the goodness of God I will see of the goodness of God Amen God bless [Applause] you has he not been faithful he's been so so good to us what a blessed people we are and to think at the changing of another year he's going to be faithful in 2025 and he's going to be good to us and he's going to take care of us for he's mindful of us and I certainly want to thank brother Ron for the opportunity not only tonight but you know throughout the year to be able to minister to his people and to um he gives us that opportunity and we don't take it lightly and we don't take it for granted because there are you know pastors out there that it's if you want Pulpit time go get Pulpit time somewhere else and you know you see and I and I don't take it lightly brother Ron and I appreciate it and if you have your Bibles let's just turn in our scriptures to Matthew 6 Matthew 6:25 and I'm going to read this portion of scripture it's very familiar and I and I believe it's very encouraging in verse 25 says therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat what you shall drink nor eat yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raymen behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor do they gather into barns yet your heavenly father feed them are ye not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add any add one cubit unto his stature and why take ye thought for reignment consider the lies of the field how that they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not AR raid like one of these wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall not he also not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what we shall eat nor what we shall drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that he have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and all his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you take therefore no thought for the tomorrow for the tomorrow shall take thought for itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof let's just bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father Lord at the closing hours of 2024 we just humble ourselves once again and we just ask that we would say something to your people that would encourage them into this coming year be with us I pray in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated you know it's such a special time of year the closing hours of one and the breaking and the dawn of another year and as we begin to look look and you see within this moment that we have within this present moment you can reflect on things that maybe you didn't fulfill or maybe promises you didn't do of this past year or you're looking forward to the the future year of things that you can do and things that you could achieve or or become and as we sit here in this this present moment it's such a special time and the the portion of scripture that we read here that the lies they don't worry about tomorrow they just sit there and they don't they don't worry where they grow or you know through in the muck and in the M all they do is just grow and they're pushing their way up to to to the sunlight and you see the the the fouls of the air they just wake up and they they fly in the morning and they're not worried about this and the the problems of tomorrow and where I'm going to get my next meal no but yet God feeds those the fowls all of creation what is it telling us in this portion of scripture that they're living in a present time they're not worried about the past and they're not worried about the future they're living in the moment and when you begin to W you know how would I say this here that they have faith in their creator that the one that created them is the one that's going to sustain them and that's the same thing with us tonight that we have to have faith that our very creator that created us before the foundation of the world before there was Stardust before all that he's going to sustain us and he's going to keep us into this coming year Psalms 46 And1 says God is our refuge in our strength a very present he's very present in the time of trouble he's not a god of the past he's not a god some statue some something that we worship of of of history but he he's a god of the present he's the god of the now he's the god of your present moment right now and as I begin to think and brother Ron sent the text for us just he asked us what is our vision for us individually as ministers and for our families and for the the church body and the bride globally around the world and as I began to think about it and pray about it something came to me and a sermon title came to me and it was present stage in your ministry what is your present stage of your ministry right now not as a minister but what is your present stage of your ministry because each one of us has a Ministry Our Lives speak volumes if you're living in the present you can't dwell on that past or worry about the future you're focused at the task at hand amen you know and maybe within this last year you're Ministry has changed follow this thought your ministry has changed maybe you've you've gotten married this past year and you became a father you became a wife maybe uh you you you parents you became a grandfather you you became uh you know you went from parent to being a grandparent and so your ministry changes in life and in this journey your ministry can change and you can't use a former mini your former your previous Ministry for your present state so this thought of present stage of your ministry what is this ministry right now for we have different stages that we go through brother brandham says here that in God's gifts always find their place he says when you realize what are we doing here where do we come from or what business we got here we wasn't put here by chance we was put here for purpose and we must serve that purpose but still we got to go back on the free on the basis of free moral agency where we can either serve it or reject it like Adam did in the beginning you're put upon this free moral agency you see God and it's another sermon in itself a free moral agency that you're placed here on Earth under the basis of free moral agency that you know God brother brandom says God would be unjust just to create a plan just to be a sa you know make a man to fall on purpose and then him redeem it so what did he have to do he had to create a man put him on the basis of free moral agency but he knew that the man would fall for go how could God do all the different things and express his attributes how could he do that without the on the basis of free moral agency and so we see that our ministry can change as we go through life brother Brandon 's uh Ministry changed and as I I listen to the sermon of present uh the present stage of his ministry he would begin to talk and he would we know the story of how he would he would have a vision and you know his life was going in a certain way and when he woke up he I believe is the Angel of the Lord or you know something came to him and said go to Second Timothy 4 verse one and so we know that scripture was preach the word be instant inseason reprove rebuke do all these things right and he gets to verse five because he always says that I always stop at verse five he says I always stop there because he says but watch thou in all things endure afflictions and do the work in of of an evangelist and make full proof of thy Ministry and so whenever he was in the beginning parts of his ministry he always stopped there so because the denominations wanted him everybody wanted him everybody didn't wanted the healing everyone wanted all the first and second pools they wanted all those emotions all the gifts of it and so brother Brandon would say that was the beginning part of my Ministry and I always stopped at at verse 5 because I thought that that's what I was fulfilling and he was fulfilling that portion of scripture but then we get to uh 1962 when brother brandom says the present stage of my Ministry you see something change he says why don't you go a little further her and he began to see that you know the the angel stop messing the first and second pool and he said stop trying to explain everything to everybody stop trying to explain it and try to get people to understand it he says I don't have any secrets so he's trying to get all these ones to understand it but it's not for everybody it's for an individual it's for an elect lady and so he comes to this portion of his ministry and it begins to change and he would take in the sermon it's good for us to go and listen present stage of his ministry and he begins to type it as he goes on Paul is talking about all the ones that begin to walk away why because Paul you know uh Deus would come unto Paul and he would say that you know he would walk away why because he would begin to love the world and that was in verse 10 he's uh that Deus would forsake Him having loved this present world and he would walk away brother brandom says you know he starts losing his friends and he starts get not getting invitations why because it was a changing of his ministry and he began to type at his Paul and he began to think that this old you know he be to get washed up and he he wasn't a part of the big revivals and he wasn't a part of all these you know uh uh uh things that were happening but yet God was just changing his ministry and there came a place in Paul's life that brother Brandon would say it was God that was the one that was causing the change of ministry he was causing things to come up people to leave because whenever you read verse six he was ready to be offered as a martyr and that was the greatest honor back then was to be offered as a martyr and Paul would say all has forsaken me and you know when you listen to the sermon he would begin to talk about brother Baxter brother backer said whenever I get to heaven I'm going to punch o uh Deus for leaving that Prophet because he felt sorry for him he's like I don't agree with that but you know that that's just what he felt but he's like how could he walk away from a god-called man a prophet ones that signs and follows and wonders followed this man let me ask you how are ones walking away from this message right now how are they walking away it's a Vindicated word of God that's coming this day and yet people are walking away why because it's not for him it's not for him and on that basis of free moral agency we see because God always puts us in that and he says on the God of this evil age he says now we see the church refused to accept God's word to rule over them they accepted barabus instead he says now now we all believe that because we're looking back to see what happened it's easy to look back it's easy to look back and see how let me ask you that how do people when the prophet was on this you know in this earth and he was going and preaching conventions and stuff you would say oh I would travel right along with them I would be doing everything I can to catch those meetings but let me ask you what about now what about the ministry now are we being faithful in our ministry coming to church on Wednesdays and Sundays showing oursel faithful because what you can talk about what you would have done then but what are you doing now because what you're doing now is a reflection of what you would do then he says because but if the world would have that is now this pre uh present evil age that would have been back there at that time they would do the same thing they're doing today because it's still the same word for this age being manifest he'll do it he says they can't do nothing else they are children of disobedient given to a delusion to a lie to believe a lie and to be damned by it what you what they would have done now it's easy to look back and say oh I would have done this and I would have followed Jesus and I would have sat at his feet but let me ask you are you sitting at his feet tonight and I believe you are you're in the house of God you can be out doing something else you can be out partying you can be doing all kinds of other things ushering in the new year but yet you're here in the house of God and in that same sermon he begins to talk about a a deacon he said this Deacon came to him brother Tony came to him and he had a dream and this this one hit home just in the way that he told it because he was talking about this Deacon and he had a dream and he came to brother bradam and he said this man has come unto me and he said and he says I had this dream and I don't know what it means and he comes and he says I was dreaming and I came to a man and he was wearing a black coat and he was reading books and he says I'm trying to find my way to heaven can you help me and this man says go on to the next man and so he goes on to the next man and it was a man he was wearing another black coat and he was singing songs and he says I'm trying to find my way to heaven how do I get there and he says there's a man up on the hill and he brother brandom says he was it was a man wearing overalls he says sometimes God sends men and it's not on the outside because a lot of people think the way they're dressed or the bigger the church that God's got to be in that church let me tell you he's not in the big building he it doesn't matter it can be some small church God doesn't change and so he says there was a man up in the overalls and he gets up there and he says I'm trying to find brother brand I'm trying to find my way to heaven and he says I can walk with you for so long but then I got to leave you and there's a Wilderness out there and he says well how will I know where to go and he says follow the bloody Footprints he says follow the bloody Footprints and as I've heard that story something spoke to me and says of the books will only take you so far and worship and praise can only take you so far and you get to the prophet and he's going to walk with you and he's going to show you but let me tell you he's going to lead you back to the Cross he's going to tell you to follow those bloody footprints that chist shed at Calvary and if a man tells you another way leave that man present stage of my Ministry my time is up he says how many Christians are in the way tonight how many's in the way tonight he says in here he says that are happy you started a long time ago he said done made your start and way down along the road still coming towards the end I pray that God will Crown your ministry whatever it is it may be a housewife I pray that God will Crown your ministry it may be a

through all her Tri he will see her [Music] through amen thank you thank you girls bless your sons shall We Stand uh let's take our Bibles in the book of uh Acts chapter 744 our fathers had the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness and he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with uh uh Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles whom God uh drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of of of David who found favor before God and desire to find the Tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him an house shall we pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this great privilege to be found in your house and presence Lord as we are closing Lord father God these few hours of uh the Year 20124 may your grace and love be with us and carry us along the way as we ask pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated uh want to uh take the privilege to uh the opportunity I mean to thank brother Ron uh and also the church for the um your support as uh I said it last time that uh my next time here I'll be a married man but God's grace and uh you have made it possible may God richly bless you everyone uh I can call people's names because if I call one I have to call everybody uh each one of you have been uh in a form or another uh been there able to assist us uh along that transition uh some of you didn't want me to know but the Lord made it possible for me to know that you did help may God bless you all the effort uh for tonight ID like to take um just probably have that as an introduction but I've seen the Lord leading already uh he's uh keeping the church remembrance of the things that we know already and uh the things that we are acquainted for and especially the time in which uh we are living in uh in all the types and shadows that we see out of the Bible and heart of the message is to keep us focused uh to keep our eyes straight on the goal uh as uh we seeing here um I'll probably speak on uh just for these few minutes on what house will thou build me we know that the prophet has uh spoken about this message in such a termal time in 65 in which he was uh almost cast out from all uh the surroundings as uh the brothers already projected it laying it out in the first pole second pole and arriving to to that stage and also uh as brother James spoke about your present stage of the ministry but then on this time I would like to speak on it on what house will thou build me because all of us are believers and we believe this and people are leaving the message and all these things that's fine but then what house will you built him because uh we see that uh the people of hold our fathers had a tabernacle of witness according to the prophet of the age that came down and gave them the pardon according to what he had seen and the people who had received it who had believed it because some people desired to remain back in Egypt and say well you know it's better for us to uh find ourself a leader here as we see continually in the world well we can do this and we can uh have our own messenger the eighth one and all these kind of things but then my focus now is narrowed in only to the Believers what house will you build him because uh as the Tabernacle you see God's program is laid out that from the prophet of God who was uh for told in Genesis 15 because we see from Genesis 15 uh God came to his prophet Abraham talking to him from Genesis 14 uh 15 uh 13 and 14 it's almost a thousand years in that Thousand Years God said your seed shall possess this land and shall possess the Gate of the enemy and uh that seed will be in a stranger land but I'll bring them out with a mighty hand with great riches and we see from Genesis 15 all the way to Exodus 3 It's A Thousand Years brother Bram shows us uh or the Bible shows us that Abraham lived for about 175 years Isaac came along and lived with uh his wife almost UH 60 years without having children and uh we can see Jacob coming to be born uh then Joseph come to go down in uh Egypt and all these years 130 years that Egypt uh um um Joseph lived there and for about 400 years that they were in slavery when you account for all those years you see that God said one thing the prophet preached the word and told us about all these prophecies and yet people have enough reasons today to say we have uh that the prophet is is not a true Prophet but then remember Abraham God spoke to him and told him that this is going to happen but it took a thousand years Daniel received the vision people had seen him that uh he challenged the king the faith of the king and everything the decree of the king and at the end of the day you find himself that all the rest of the Jew left but it was only three people that remained with the word in those days and people who had access to Daniel's Vision they could have had all the reason to tell Daniel that your prophecy is wrong because they didn't see the days of the coming of the head the stone and today people are looking for the same thing brother Bram did this we can give him credit for all the miracle and all this and all that but this didn't happen that means that he the false prophet but then here the Bible says in the book of Acts that our fathers received according to Moses we have received the message according to brother Brandon then to make that Tabernacle according to the fashion that he has seen there then now the question is to us now who have received in like manner what house shall we build him we are not after them who have backed and went back and stuff but now the possession now is in our hands because after Moses has died Joshua took the people he said rise up and you shall take them with you in the land according to the prophecy of Genesis 15 Joshua had never seen Abraham he had just read Abraham out of the books some of us have not seen brother Bram we just reading him out of the books and hearing him out of the tapes so then after receiving all that all those books what house are we going to build because the Tabernacle in the wilderness was made out of three parts the utter quotes what we see the inner coat that we cannot see and the holy of holies that only you know what's in there and out of the three play top parts of the Tabernacle what how are we building it because we can dress however we want or we can be like coren D in the wilderness well brother Bram say this well it's not really according to that I think according to my interpretation but he said make it according to the fashion as you had seen up there and now to you bride of Jesus Christ what house will you build him because brother Brenham is showing us here in the uh says Church ages Church ages book in the revelation of Jesus Christ because as Moses or Abraham had received the talk with God God spoke to him mouth to mouth and he to hear he received what he had received and he made it available to the people but Bram says the time is at hand the time was not at end previously certain things were not to be made manifest yet in the wisdom an economy of God this Mighty Revelation though fully known to God like Abraham God had known everything but he just gave him a little bit of information could not could not come for here through thus we immediately uh immediately learn a principle the revelation of God for each age can come in that age alone each one of us in the the present stage of our ministry that revelation will come at the appointed time for that part of the ministry look at history of Israel what I just pointed to us the revelation of God to Moses came only at a specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people cried out to to God Jesus himself came to the fullness of time he being a complete revelation of godhead and in this age lean the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think of this and heit it well for we are in the end time today everything that we are doing according to the fashion do you have access to the revelation we are turning the page 2024 is done changing status and from single to married and sick and being healed and being uh born again and all these things but then now how are you going to build it I Believe by God's grace we will go into more details but this just an overview of how are we going to build this Tabernacle because this Tabernacle because the almighty has made all these things we go we take a piece of food we make the propriate out of it we build a beautiful Tabernacle but God does not dwell in things made out of man's hand but he's seeking a place to of race but then that place of race is he told Moses according to the pattern not according to my own ideas my own interpretation of things well you know we becoming reformers now you know oh this brother did this in his wedding and I'll do this here this one did this in in his home and my wife will be this way no we are not called to be reformers we are not called to be following others or following the trend it is 2024 no no no no no according to the fashion because he has called e seed to fulfill his purpose and that purpose now the people now out to go to Moses and said give us the pon give us the book and he is revelation 10 it says that the voice that I heard spoke to me go to the angel take the book eat the book after eating the book do what sit them no prophesies the present stage of our ministry and if this ministry has been given to us we are to labor because the time had not previously there there was a time that Bram says in the church ages book it says that you know God did not fulfill certain things but he left them for you and I to do because when you looking the whole history of Israel in the world in Egypt God had Place events around them that will push them to cry out to him that will lead them all the way into the Wilderness in order to fulfill what he had spoken to Abraham about brother abam says in the message what house will thou build me he said hey I old I had already uh uh promise to the brother of Tabernacle that if there's anything new that God will give to me I'll come back here and preach it but in which house will thou build me it says like you know now I don't need I don't need to go back again to Jeffersonville I can walk up here according to Revelation that God has given to perigrine in order now I can just come up here and then deliver the message Hallelujah but God does not dwell in homes buildings made of men if go God had to profess a message today if God had to display a sons and daughter of God today he doesn't need to bring some people from Africa or somewhere out there he must have a home that is ready for him he must have people who are ready somewhere out there at work at home at the workplace a tabernacle ready whereby he can come and manifest that but then our outer Court our inner court and the holy of holies must be according to the fashion because if it's not according to the fashion then what is it after because God's program in Act 7 as we just seen it started all the way until David and then the Millennium that had to be built the type of the Millen because everything that we are building in our Earthly journey is a foreshadow of what our Millennium should look like because if it's our PN is after what the world wants us to have then God will look at us say no no no no no the material that I gave to David to gather in order to build and get ready for the millennium if it doesn't mat this cannot get up there if you can't have long hair here you can't have longer there it's according to the pattern if you can be humble here you can be humble over there if you can sit in the congregation of the Saints here you can sit in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus it has to be done according to the pardon if I can't make it to every service that means that you know I can be there every day either because the Devils were making there time to time he comes where you from I was roaming the Earth and then after that he gone it is the same church the same way with church attendance what house will you build me what house are we bringing in in our ministry whereby we stand and we looking and we are working we are gathering the materials we are putting them together according to what Parn according to what fashion according to what Vision because the vision is not just you know I'm a Believer I want back of light no he wants something to be done and has it been done now each one of us according these three layers we are to to work because if uh a brother has to tell you oh you have to come to church we're not at that stage anymore after we have heard all these messages I believe like you know this will help us as I seen the spirit moving among the brothers who came before me he pointing us to the same thing because if we had known each other like you know what are you going to preach what are you going to say that's a human-made thing but when you look and you see the move of the spirit and brother Bram says here uh to finish up in this uh prayer a thankful prayer that he was uh making and it's uh you can listen to it at home if you want God's grace is a very small uh three minute prayer the whole tape is 3 minutes anyway um brother BR I'm being grateful to the Lord about everything that he has uh he has been for for him and uh for the entire church and uh this is also my prayer for us all together as the family of Jesus Christ Our Father it's indeed a privilege it's in the prayer in 55 April 10th evening our father it's indeed a privilege for us uh to come to you to Bow our heads in humility to the Dust whereby where we were taken from and someday shall return if Jesus terries but oh how we thank thee for this glorious marvelous hope that we have that that that uh D shall put our

genesis chapter 5 we're going to be reading few verses chapter 5 verse 5 in all the days of Adam on all the days that Adam lived were 930 years and he died verse 8 and all the days of Seth were 912 years and he died verse 11 of the same chapter and all the days of Enos were 95 years and he died 14 and all the days of Canaan were 910 years and he died 17s and all the days of Mahal were 895 years and he died and 20 and all the days of Jared were 960 and two years and he died the last one is 24 and Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him am amen hallelujah may God bless the Ring of his word as you have your seat sent this evening I just want to take this little moment to thank the Lord who has protected us for this year that is finishing against sicknesses and hardship that we went through uh especially myself I can say my health was not that good for this year but the Lord that is always giving us Victory stood to my side and to our side and and tonight we can thank him my thanks go so goes to brother Ron our pastor you know sometimes it takes uh a discovery from yourself to know to get to know some somebody you don't need to hear from someone else but you need to get to know the person yourself I got to learn and uh know brother Ron the spirit he has and you can tell even that spirit in the church I can say he's my mentor I'm proud to say that because he's a guiding me and uh showing me the way in a good Pathway to follow I have a little thought tonight when I saw brother Ron sending the message to all of us ministers saying if you have something we need you to come with something some vision for the church for your families and for the bride in general right away your thought came to my mind walk with God a closer walk with God that's the title of my little sermon this evening you know brother bam says we are living in the age where Satan's power is tougher to fight we're living in the age where demons are being turned loose on the earth we are living in the age where hell which is the other dimension is not there in that sixth Dimension but it's here let me tell you you know you are robbing your shoulders with those that are going to different direction than you walking in the stores walking on the Street you are robbing your shoulders with those that would be totally different Direction with you but we believe we are the people that will see the end time because we read here seven times from Adam from the first Adam we read six times and he died six times and he died but the seventh time Enoch walked with with God and he was not for God took him as I said my title is closer walk with God we don't have to pretend to have walked with him but we need to make sure we are walking truly with him and my Visions for this church and for the bride in general we need a closer walk with God am you know when Enoch was was seeing his days dwindling or going away he start walking closer to God and at the end of his this walk God took him in other words to C off this walk with God the Rapture took place so as is the seventh the seven churches from the second Adam which is Jesus Christ we need to keep in mind that we are the people that will see the Rapture taking place I know we have two ways to live this Earth either it's by the way of death or by the way of rapture either way we are the seventh to see the end time happening in our eyes and as such we need to have a closer walk with God otherwise you'll be backsliding like many others have done these last past many years we've seen people walking away from the message we've seen people backsliding not only the Believers but we've seen ministers those that have stood and took side of Jesus preaching in deep messages backsliding leaving this message my question was did they walk truly with God or they pretended to have walked with God God you go in the Bible you see Mary and Joseph is the Jewish people they used to have the Habit to go every year to the temple in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival after they finish the festivities they were going back home but they walked the Bible says they walked one day pretending that they have Jesus but they didn't have him he stay in the temple talking about the father's business it took one day for them to realize that he was not with them you don't want to do such a thing like Joseph and Mary did don't pretend to have him but make sure you have him that's why tonight we need to talk about the closer walk with God you know when Elijah was about to be taken off this Earth Elisha was kind of walking closer to him because the Days of Elijah was numbered and he had a closer walk with him to have a double portion of what Elijah had because Elijah has was scheduled to be taken off of this Earth and Elisha walked closer to him we have another group of Believers that walked with Jesus we have cleopas and his friend they walked with him and had the questions about the promise of that hour but it took a walk with God for them to have the clear understanding of what had taken place because they were debating between he was he reison or was was he was not reason because this is the resurrection day they had a question about the event of the day they have a question about the promise of that hour it took Jesus to draw night to them and start walking with them and teaching to them about the promise of the hour we heard about Steven saying the other day when he preached about when he preached and he talked about us reading the message us getting into the message to read there's no restriction for the Believers to go into the message and dig deep read and get close to the Jesus so for them to know what took place in that time they had to have a walk with Jesus Jesus doesn't presented himself like here I am I'm the one that has reason no he takes you to the scriptures the Bible says he start with Moses up to the prophets of that hour concerning his resurrection he said why are you so slow to believe what the prophet have said he doesn't present himself like that he has to take you through the word in other word he was vindicating those prophets saying what they have said was true and you have to see it now for I'm reason you and I have believed the message of a prophet that has been Vindicated I can say like bam was dramatizing when he was talking about Jesus descending in hell he say even there he Vindicated the prophets because he told the non-believers why didn't you believe Enoch because what whatever he said he was talking about me why didn't you believe such a prophet he was vindicating them on the time of those disciples he was vindicating the prophets that have prophesied about his resurrection and in the days we are living in we saw the same God vindicating the prophet Hallelujah you saw the pillow fire on the top of the Prophet you saw how many times God has drawn n to him to vindicate the ministry that we are believing it takes a closer walk with God and you know as the children of Abraham copas and his friend when they heard when he was preaching to them Jesus was talking to them they didn't want to let him go because something was burning in their heart they grabbed him they say stay with us here as is the Believers believing the same Jesus believing the same God is our Father Abraham we have a such a ministry here that has the word of God we should cling to him amen because he's sending us and pointing us to Jesus Christ a Ministry that is drifting us away from Jesus Christ we should stay away from that but the one that is pointing us to Christ we should cling because the time we are living in it's a very CR of time it's not the time that you need to walk by yourself it's the time that you need a closer walk with God Enoch didn't walk with God like a human being walking there and him as a human being working here God was in him and what whatam says if did not doubt the word of God whatever God God say to him he believed it so as a Believer we don't have to like bam says when you believe don't put a full stop put a CA because the Revelation is evolving God might show you something more than you have have not seen before what you going to do most people because the time we living in it's like it's compared to the time of the judges before the prophet samel where everybody was doing things according to their own dictate as if there was not Prophet truly there was not Prophet at that time but we here we are living in the days of the voice of the seventh angel Hallelujah we cannot behave as such we cannot behave as those in the ter of Judges doing things to our own dictate that will result result in backsliding that will result in false teaching because we're doing things according to our own dictate you take it the the you go back in the Bible in the time of uh David the ark should be brought back put on the shoulders of the priests but he did it according to the dictate of the population but the prophet was in the land Nathan was there heed to go consult and talk to the prophet he didn't do that as a result of that somebody died you see we don't live in the period like in the period of the the judges we are living in the time in the voice of the seventh angel you have any question we have the message book when you don't understand it the pastor is here as the prophet said go ask to your pastor if you don't understand or take your time pray God on his own time he will come and give the Revelation to you as long as you show the interest in the thing because the unique ethopian showed the interest in the thing he wanted to know who was the prophet talking about here God who knows our heart he sent the prophet Phillip go to The Chariot because he saw the need in the heart of the uniion if you do have the same needs the Mighty God is more than able to send his angels whether he's behind his Pulpit or you can talk to the pastor or one of the minister you can talk to them or fellowshipping with a brother who has a spirit he is a spirit filled a brother with a good Revelation can give you something because God sees the need in your heart we don't live in the days of the judges those days are gone we are living in the days of the voice of the seventh angel Hallelujah go to the message read yourself discover yourself it's the time where we need to live closer to God we don't have to pretend to live with him or to have him in our heart we need to make sure he's in our heart because he's the inside teacher closer walk with God Enoch didn't plan to leave this earth but it it it's up to God God to determine because the Bible says in Hebrews 11 Enoch pleased God how could he please God in other way than just believing his word because without faith you cannot please God and baram says whatever it takes for us to be taken away for the rapturing faith has been brought to us the same one who closed the book is the sameone who in this end time has opened the book and we don't read from a closed book we are reading from an open book we should be a happier people on this face of this Earth because we know where we're going let me shock you I told you earlier that you are rubbing your shoulders with people that will be going in different direction than you we you came in the family with the brothers and sisters in your family that will be going this different direction from you it's only the human blood that will keep you together but at the end you'll be going separate directions if the human blood can keep us United like that how much more the blood of Jesus Christ because you and I we're going to spend eternity together therefore eternity should be starting here you and I fellowshipping loving one another because we're going to spend the same eternity beyond the curtain of time don't pretend to have walked with God make sure you have him in your heart because one day or the other you see many people that have left the message they pretended to have walked with him they pretended to have God in their heart but look at the end look at the end this tells us that they didn't have him Joseph and Mary they took one day that's a lot 24 hours you even looking around where is my son many people are in the same conditions in this same time they pretend to have Jesus with them let me tell you you need a closer walk with Jesus for this coming year you have a the responsibility to make sure you have a Jesus in your heart don't pretend to have him make sure you have him because like I said this year was not easy for me even for many of us but there's not a promise saying that it's going to be easy in the time of Esther a decree went forth they sent a decree to kill all the Jewish people and when the was sent forth there's no way to reverse it because it's the decree of the king let me tell you the situations we are going through is going to be getting tougher and tougher but God will give us the means to overcome the situation because Esther she was given the scepter of the king and you and I have been given a scepter of the king Hallelujah if my words AB in you ask what you will because Esther she heard the sep of the king the king said even the half of my kingdom I give it to you am she was there for a purpose the Jews were sched to be wiped off the Earth but because of Esther and she had the SE of the the king she saved the life of many you not here in this message have hazly God has brought you to the message for a purpose you have family members your family your wife husbands brothers and sisters friends you have the scepter of the the king if my words abide in you ask what you will and Walking with God he should keep us humble because we need his grace and mercy because those that have backsliding today that are backsliding today you and I are not more than them it just takes the grace and mercy of God this will bring me to my second scripture it's going to be in the Corinthian chapter 12 verse 9 2 Corinthians 12:9 this is Paul talking he said and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weaknesses that's my vision for this local church for my family for our pastor for all the brothers and sisters to remain humble to depend on his grace and mercy because this urge we are living in is tough to fight it takes God to our side to overcome it we're going through many things we don't need to walk alone we need a closer walk with him we want him in our heart in our subconscious we want to make sure he's in our heart because he said himself Lo I'll be with you even in you until the end of the time but want to make sure he's in us until the end of the time remember Billy one time he was thirsty night time and wanted to have a cup of water and then daddy told him go to the kitchen and get it no Dad I can't walk it's dark it took the prophet to hold the son the his son's hands to walk to walk with him until the kitchen it's dark in this end time gross Darkness upon people you don't need to walk on your own you you don't you don't need to walk with yourself you need to walk with him you need to make sure you have him in your heart otherwise you're not going to make it we don't fight with human beings we fight with spirit in Heavenly places it takes the one who knows the dimensions to teach us to show us the pathway butam says in this message in this message the are 10 virgins and 144,000 Jews he said oh God May someday the church which is the type of Enoch 500 years walked before God walking walking in the light with a testimony that everything God said he did it he did it he didn't displease him what the Lord said do Enoch done it now he was a type remember the AR is the type of the Jews the 144,000 that carried over which is Noah and his Bunch but Enoch went home just a little bit before the flood you know that so Enoch just kept walking in the light so one day he felt his feet getting off the ground he just kept walking and he walked on into Glory without even dying that's right God took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony that he walked in the light of God kept walking walking you and I have received the message of the hour Vindicated by the god almighty God it's not something that a human being has brought to us God himself Vindicated this message and this is the lightam says in there is a man that can turn on the light he said the light is when the scripture is being fulfilled that's the light Malachi 4 is not a history for us Malachi 4 is not the future for us Malachi 4 is the reality we are walking in the light you know the scripture when it's not fulfilled it still be it still has to be questionable they can question it they can debate about it they can say okay you'll be fulfilled or has been fulfilled but when you see it fulfilled before your wondering eyes that's the light you and I are walking in the light and therefore we need to please God for him to take us home because living this Earth doesn't depend on us it depends on him when he see you walking with him pleasing him then he will decide to take you remember the teaching about the dimensions or the kingdoms but R brought the other time same thing you can go into the other dimension or another kingdom on your own a power from there had to be brought to you for you to be taken up guess what he might delay he coming but he might not delay your going Hallelujah cuz I said we're going to leave this Earth We're Going to exit this Earth by two ways either it's by death or Rapture that's why I'm saying he might not delay your going you know it depends on him he's the one to appreciate your walking with him don't displease him by disbelieving his message believe put a comma take your time read the word dig deep into the message the Lord will come on the appointed time to give you the Revelation as he did with Enoch I mean with uh cleopas and his friends when you talk about him he draws nigh we're talking about him tonight and I believe his presence is here so for this coming year my will wishes my prayers my vision is for you and I to walk closer to God With God if we have walked with him in the past but this time I want you and I to make sure we are walking closer with him because we are getting ready to exit this Earth may the Lord God bless you Amen brother Stephen if you'll come forward we're going to just sing one song J if you'll come play I just want to please the Lord Enoch had a walk with God I just want to please the Lord let's sing this just simple chorus as brother Steven comes tonight Enoch please God let's stand as we sing this and then brother Steven will deliver his sermon tonight may we have the Revelation that in our can amen let's sing it tonight I just want to please the Lord in his will in every way to be lost in his presence in his him say if that's your desire lift your hand to him and sing tonight I just want to pleas the Lord be his will in every way to be lost in his presence found in his likess to hear him say Well done [Music] somay God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles turn with me to the book of First Corinthians chapter 5 and we'll read verse 8 and while you're turning there I just want to say thank you brother Ron for another year of mentorship and also friendship I certainly appreciate it bless you thank you and God bless you also another year and here we are again and it's a good thing uh 1 Corinthians chapter 5 5 and verse 8 and it says therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth amen you may be seated as I read one more scripture here it's found in the book of James chapter 5 and verse 17 and it says Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of 3 years and 6 months I would like to speak just for a few moments tonight on uh being a little more sincere being a little more sincere and uh when obviously when brother Ron had sent the text out and I thought my what what is my vision for my family myself and so forth uh sincerity came to my heart and uh I think it's one of those things that all of us could do a little bit better with is being a little more sincere and if there was anybody that was ever uh probably the most sincere person that we've ever known outside of Jesus Christ would be brother brandham himself you know brother brandham he had these meetings in Durban South Africa and and and you know uh hundreds of thousands of converts and different things and many miracles and God doing many things in his life but yet uh he would get to a place and and he was sitting on his bed he put his hands behind his head and he said my uh uh I better hurry up and do something for the Lord because of yet I've done nothing for him and this s the sincerity of this man was uh was something else to say the to say the least and we see that in brother bram's life um there was there was this mountain range with Seven Peaks and uh these Seven Peaks really meant something to brother brandom and we understand that it was uh showing a type of his life and uh uh there was some high peaks and some low Peaks and there was some valleys and everything and I I I I got to thinking about this and I thought you know brother Brandon we have his life story and he was an open book before us and I'm just so very thankful that he was like that because a lot of times uh when we have valleys in our lives we think it's it's just us and we think that it's because of something that we've done wrong or that God is angry with us and he's not pleased with us but really uh if he kept us on a Mountaintop experience all the time our fruit would never grow and when we see the life of brother Brandon we realize ourselves that God takes us through valleys and mountaintops for a purpose and we see many things in brother bram's own life for instance of his wife and his baby daughter they're uh laying dead and and and uh before his daughter died he he said her pain was uh so great that her little eyes crossed over and he said whenever a little baby or a little kid would come through the prayer lines with crossed eyes that there would never be a one that their eyes would never be straightened again and it was because of the things that God brought brother brandham through uh the the trials of his life the the the refining of the gold in his life was for others that they May benefit from what he had went through and a lot of times we go through valleys and we go through mountaintops and a lot of the times we don't speak of going climbing from the valley to the Mountaintop The Climb sometimes is worse than the valley coming out of the valley and climbing the mountain sometimes is is the worst part of the whole journey it is for me anyways they say well uh I hiked to Grand Canyon with the brothers one time and and and they said well how did you enjoy the hike and I didn't enjoy it one bit because I was always looking at my feet it it wasn't enjoyable the scenery wasn't enjoyable because I had I just wanted to get to the top but when I got to the top I was happy I was happier in the valley than I was climbing the mountain but if you want to go from the valley to the mountain you've got to climb the mountain and so we've all been through many things this year but I want you to be encouraged that it's worth it all what does it mean to be sincere to be sincere it means to be free from pretense or deceit proceeding from genuine feelings so in other words being genuine means you're not being fake being genuine means uh you're you're a real Christian you're not pretending you're you're not pre pretending to love the Lord You're not pretending brother Freddy to walk with the Lord but being sincere it's it's genuine and it has a feeling with it it's not a feeling of some sort of um emotional makeup or some kind of feeling with uh uh uh you know uh Sensations and and emotions and tingling down your neck but a true genuine feeling for one another and when we have a true genuine feeling for one another and a true genuine feeling for God we will be sincere in our walk with God God am so we realize that uh brother brother martin alluded to it uh very briefly and I'll do the same thing um being more sincere we see that uh God told brother brandom and he said if you'll be sincere and you'll get to people to believe in you not even cancer will stand in your way and so we see that he would always say Do you believe me to be God's servant do you believe me to be God God's prophet and he he would say things like this because he was getting the people to believe in him because the angel had told him if you be sincere get the people to believe in you nothing will stand in your way and because he was sincere with the people he had a genuine feeling for the people he wanted them to believe in him so that they may get their requests answered before God now first pull we understand was a uh it was it was a pull of the flesh man it was a pull of the outward man where brother Brandon would take people by the hand and he would bump have little bumps and different things in his hand and he would be able to tell the people what was wrong and what condition they were in in their life but in order for him to go from the first to the second pool he had to be a little more sincere in his life and in his walk with God and so he went through the second pool which we understand is the discernment of the spirits which now it went from the outer Court to the inner Court which is the spirit man he was no longer just dealing with the flesh outward person but he would take somebody and he would discern their Spirits going a little deeper into their lives bringing something out and and it was all really for a purpose but in order for brother brandom to go from the first to the second pool he had to be more sincere in his life it was no different from when he would go from the second to the Third pool he was told you need to be a little more sincere so we go from the outer Court fleshman believer and brother brandham preaches a sermon why are people so too uh so tossed to and fro and he said the problem is too many people are outer Court Believers they've never entered into the holy place or to the inner Court uh outer Court Believers are tossed to and fro because if the weather's bad they're in a bad mood if if they're having a bad day everything's just terrible if if the Sun is out and everything's going good they're good they're tossed to and fro because of outward things is happening in their lives an incourt believer now he goes he he steps away from from the from the outward things that would bother us but now he steps into a place where it's an artificial light he steps into a place where the candlesticks are and where the the table of showbread is where the altar of incense is and and and it's it's a place that is a little more sincere than the outer Court people who brought their sacrifice to God they they couldn't enter into the to the holy place or to the inter uh into the in Veil The The Next Step because uh uh it wasn't their position to do so but in order for a priest to do that he had to be sincere in his walk with God but in order for us now to go from the from our first pull of Our Lives because as as we all have a Ministry in our life like brother James was saying we all have three pools in our lives we all have a a pull of the flesh man where we're caught up with the with the emotion and the flesh man we all have a a second pool where we're a little more spiritual and we notice a little more uh uh Revelation and things in our lives but it's it's not just good enough for us to go to the second we we must go past the veil and into that holy of holies but just the regular priests in the time of the temple were unable to go into the holiest of holies even the high priest himself he could just go in there once a year and when he went into the holiest of holies he had to be more sincere in his walk than he did previously because now he had to change his garment now he had to change how he walked now he had to change how he spoke and he would walk and he would say holy holy holy onto the Lord God Almighty his clothing was different his speech was different how he walked was different his sincerity coming before God was more sincere than it was in the in the inner Veil or in the Holy place now don't leave it just for the high priest or Old Testament this is a type for you and I and where we're living today in order for us to go to the next stage in our ministry in order for us to go from uh a a an outward believer a flesh believer to a spiritual believer to going into the very shakina Glory the very presence of God himself it's going to take a walk of sincerity as going to take Take a Walk of changing how we dress of changing how we talk of changing how we walk of changing the things that we listen to and we watch and how we live our daily lives in order to come into the very presence of God himself where the shakina glory is where there is no death and there's no more artificial light in that place but it's the very light of God himself the very life of God himself it is not about quality our quantity we say well how do we uh how do I be a little more sincere in reading my Bible and praying and we think well I'm going to make a New Year's resolution I'm going to pray for 10 minutes every day and I'm going to read for this amount every day and we try to set this big old goal but it's not about the quantity of how much we do but it's about the quality and sincerity of the heart of the believer that'll take us into the presence of God so brother Stephen what is your what is your vision for yourself and for us a little more sincerity a little more it doesn't matter about the quantity but it's the quality of time that we spend with God God bless you pleas pleasing pleasing pleasing pleasing pleasing the cha family has a song special for us before brother Warren comes let's stand and sing pleasing may we be more sincere pleasing the cha if you'll come forward the chw was let me be pleasing to you

shaking keep going outside drinking water amen let's read uh the Bible let's Stand Together forgive me uh let's read John chapter 2 verse 9 to 10 when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servant which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and said unto him every man at the beginning that sit forth good wine and when man had will drunk then that which is worse but the that but but thou H has keept the good the good wine until now let's bow our heads father as 2024 book will close tonight and 2025 will

earth a perfect and upright men of men and women one that fearth God and shun evil am Amen brother Ron asked three things to say what is your vision to your family what is your vision to the church and what is your vision to the whole Universal Believers first I will I want to see myself as a good husband to my wife Maria the most beautiful woman on earth I want to be a good father to my children without Jesus Christ I'm not a good father not a good husband only by him we can do it amen I am I'm always say wherever I go this message church has very very few of divorce because you know why because divorce is not welcome here my Vision to the church I want to see our pastor brother Ron healthy powerful preacher and sister Sandy as a helper of brother Ron sister Rebecca I want to see

said the Lord walk in the China Glory I will show you a messiah anointed one of God standing here on Earth right now and always brother Billy Paul say if God taught it the prophet spoke it and I believe it I believe that this message right now the church that the prophet is praying is here one day sister maida Brenham was was praying about her future husband and she said Lord I want to see my future husband in the Bible so one day she opened her Bible and said I will point the scripture of my future husband behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and rful day and and she said no it can't be and she did it again and it's behold I will send you Elijah the prophet and then the manifestation came and as as the prophet said this give me a church that's completely Anointed with God till their every action and move are that set the Lord I believe that I am one of them that we are the Church of these last days amen that we can point our scripture to Revelation chapter 19 that let us be glad and rejoice and be give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready and to her has granted that she should be arrayed in linen clean and white for the the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints amen vision for the bride Universal once we see our position in the body of Christ we are here in this church this end time message church this evening light message Fellowship is unique we are gathered from different countries from different cultures but why we understand each other brother John my language you understood my language amen now once we are fed by the strong me that brother Mario said now we will follow the commission of the Lord that pre preached the gospel to Every Creature amen I went last last Sunday to the house of sister Josie and I saw on her backyard the the the the orange oranges and I I was thinking about the oranges about the fruit and I was thinking about the fruit don't eat fruits but the fruit is for somebody that needs to satisfy their needs to give healing to someone to give encouragement to somebody to preach this message to the people amen I believe the prophet said here in the godhead explained 1961 I believe that the blood cell was broke at Calvary for the remission of our sins and the spirit went out of him and came back upon the church because the church the Holy Spirit the Christ the logos was in us now the Holy Spirit by the baptism making us Christ separated himself giving his life to each one of us that we as a group of people people might be the Church of God Amen who is he talking he's talking to you and me in 2025 I want to see a Victorious church I want to see the Glorious church I want to see the army that don't even have a scratch in battle amen I was reading this church Universal I am a missionary I was thinking about the the the the the the baby that rose from the dead three weeks ago and I was thinking about these two words the the word has two meanings word means logos logos is the written word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God but then on the other side it said it's a Rema word it's a Rema that will come to a person the litter can kill but the spirit will give life the word that I speak unto you has there are spirit and they are light now in Romans chapter 10:14 how then shall they they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him in whom they have not heard and how shall they he hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent and it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they that have not all obey the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who ha believed our report so so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word Rema it takes somebody to carry this message and it will become a spoken word brothers and sisters God called us in a different kinds of ministry my Ministry is to preach the word of God maybe your ministry is to wash dishes or massage your husbands when he come home each of us has Ministry but remember you have the read my word the prophet said the voice he said what is the voice he said the voice of many Waters is the voice of the ministers we preach the gospel to the lost and dying people it's the Judgment the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that cried out to the people in every age brothers and sisters this is my position I pray that God will give me strength to continue this battle God already won the battle we're just fulfilling our scripture before I close listen to this this is this is for us the prophet said this and knowe it it not he said just watch for 4 months before he died he said just watch stay close to Christ let me warn you now as a minister of the Gospel of this don't take any foolishness don't imagine anything stay right there uh until this aside of the inside is Anchor to the word that's your right in Christ because that's the only thing that going to cuz we are in the most deceiving age that we are ever live in it would deceive the very elected if it was possible because they have not anoint they have anointing they can do anything like the rest of them clean up your lives 2025 clean up your lives or clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said now I mean like your house rent and stop you got to do it get all your things up your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of our Lord something is fixing to happen one day the brother told me he said I was there in Tucson Tabernacle in the year 1977 he said young people people they got married they they went to the car dealer and got Foria nice cars because they thought the Rapture will come 1977 you cannot fool God clean your lives pay your debts closing scripture Joshua chapter 3 verse 5 if you can pull that brother Joshua chapter 3 verse 5 and the Holy Spirit Joshua is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow 2025 the Lord will do wonders Among Us AM glor stand together God bless you amen here we are at the closing of 2024 it was just like a vapor we know that uh time is doing very very quickly we're going to have the Brethren to come forward we're going to go into communion and uh I had a few things to say there and I was going to be the last but uh we'll save it for uh for tomorrow amen so uh but the if you followed the thread of the Holy Spirit go ahead and just play something uh there Justin just something very nicely Softly if you follow the thought of the Holy Spirit through the Brethren hold fast till I come take no thought for tomorrow live in the present tense what house will you build me make it according to the fashion of his word walk with God and stay close to him amen have a closer walk Stephen said be a little bit more sincere I think we can all say Amen to that Amen brother Warren talked about saving the for last you know when you realize that this seventh Church age that God sent a word he saved the best for lives because we he knew that we would need it amen that he would have to send a greater light because there's a greater Darkness oh I thank God for his grace and uh you know I had asked sister Linda just earlier in the day if she'd get a few things ready for me I'm I will show you tomorrow but sister Linda tonight I I am officially making you the church historian and um curator to record all events marriages births baptisms and deaths because at the end of the year I'd like the little summation so I will do a little bit of that for tomorrow as we go into the new year uh as our first day of service and uh I want to thank all of you for being a part of this church it is a microcosm of a very large body we are not Elite where we say we're it and we have it all no there's the bride of Christ is all over the world in fact he's been pulling a bride out in every age he's just finishing it up and he's saving the best Rel last praise the Lord amen we're going to be taking uh communion here in a in just a moment when takes about 15 20 minutes we want to you come through to not hesitate like perhaps we would on another evening it says during communion the deacons will not hand the wine or bread to you so when you come up you will grab your own Bread and Wine and if you need help grabbing them you get up to the front and let the deacons know and they will hand it to you and after we take communion what I'd like you to do is get with your families okay if you're scattered around I'd like you get in with your families and let's get on our knees let's go into the new year in prayer amen because if there's anything that's going to help us to get through 2025 is to start the year in prayer that's right and that's a good thing the Bible says for I have received of the Lord this is 1 Corinthians 11: 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in the blood in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself let him eat of the bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come to together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen amen so we're going to partake of our communion here tonight and our Brethren here are going to assist you and what they'll do they'll direct you we'll have two lines that'll come down here and direct and we'll go out they'll they'll show you what to do if you haven't been here with us before so just um be with us while we pray here we have the bread let's just bow our heads together heavenly father as I take this bread and I break it you said do this of as you come together as in a remembrance of me I pray heavenly father that you will bless this bread and those that partake of it may there be visions and may there be healings May there be Deliverance because your body was broken for us bless this bread I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen yeah just take the lid off heavenly father I lay my hands upon these canisters which hold the wine wine is the source of life it is not grape juice it's wine it has life in it I pray that you will bless each and every one father that partakes of it and I pray heavenly father that you will bless our service as we end this 2024 into a new year we ask it

God bless you [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] for I can't think of a better way to enter into 2025 but on your knees in prayer and asking God for divine leadership more of the Holy Spirit more sincere walk with God a closer walk with God musician if you come up here now brother Brenham always dismissed directly after communion and everything instead of taking foot washing which would take more time and we know that out there they're they're they're doing the fireworks and old angine and many of them are drinking and and uh such things so I just say to all of you please extremely be extremely careful driving home amen because right after midnight it seems like the bar is empty out and people are doing and they're on the road and we want to make sure that we did have no no things there um that would be a hindrance we do have service tomorrow and at regular time I will be speaking so remember me in prayer amen God bless you let's all Stand Together brother Robert that song I Believe brother John Sang it he's running after running after me what's it good of God goodness of God goodness of God I
