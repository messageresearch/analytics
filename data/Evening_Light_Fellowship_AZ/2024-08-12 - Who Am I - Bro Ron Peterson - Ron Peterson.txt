life you live and Lord let our lives be a reflection of you that they don't see us that they see our Lord Jesus amen God bless you let's remain standing turn with me to the Book of Exodus Exodus chapter 3 verses 1- 11 thank you Lord how many of you believe we're in another Exodus praise the Lord don't you just love to read his word amen his word is a lamp unto our feet it is a compass it is a guide it tells things that have been and shows us things that will be Exodus 3 and verse one the Bible says now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to horb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I he said draw not draw not nigh hither but put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place wherein thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard of their Cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out of the land unto a good land and a large and a land flowing with milk and honey and the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send the thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I wow than Lord burning bush Angels Supernatural events happening you said Lord you're coming down to deliver your people but I'm going to send you who who am I that I should go into pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt may God add the blessing the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of God I would like to title my sermon this morning who am I and I want to take as a subject as the Discerning of yourself and I want to share this morning just uh it's going to go in a couple directions but but we pray that the holy spirit will bring this together uh towards the end and you'll see the thought that God has been dealing with me on there's two things I want you to discern your life I want a selfawareness of yourself of who you are and then I want you to recognize then who you are because when you know who you are you take your position you know I'm really amazed uh many times at how people discern everybody else hey you see what's wrong with that family you see that church over there you see that guy hey if you know and and we criticize and we critique everyone you know have you seen how their children Act well they're a bunch of brats and uh you know have you looked at your kids what about your home I remember you know I had gotten married and we had a couple kids already and my brother was having to take care of my kids just for while sy's in the hospital and I went and I think it was birth of Matthew or whatever and so anyway the kids you know they even though he looks like me you know my daughter you know she stood up my brother said it's time for you guys to go to bed you ain't my daddy and anyway they had a little thing there a little opposition well finally you know yeah but you're going to go to bed anyway they went to bed my brother said look man when I have kids my kids are going to tow the line buddy I tell you they're going to March around like little military men you know they're going to do everything they're I'm going to make them do it and everything well when they had kids it's just the opposite so it's really amazing how we can really discern others can't we we can man we can see what's wrong with everybody else's kids with their family with what every other church but can we discern our self we don't tend to see our own flaws do we no no when we look in the mirror what's really amazing is when we look in the mirror we're so used to looking in the mirror of ourselves and it's a just a one-sided mirror and it's this and that and you've seen yourself a million times but you you don't really look that bad you just tend you know and you and the other day I was in our master bathroom there and I was looking in a mirror and we have a mirror on a wall and I happened to be look and I caught a different angle my goodness if it was startling and I thought oh my I need some work I I need to do a few things but I want to show you the difference between a mirror and a picture because a mirror is one way you look at it you see it all the time you don't seem to be so bad but really my being a photographer and I did that in high school and I could relate to to brother Dave and brother Richard and have photography and you take pictures and then you show you know what's amazing nobody wants their picture taken but after it's taken they want to see thems oh let me see oh oh and then there's sometimes that you have the photo and they look at it and they say do I look oh do I really look that bad well the difference between a mirror and a picture a picture is more of the reality of what you look like than it uh than the mirror because in the mirror you fool yourself you look at it and you think I'm not so bad cuz it's a one-sided self-image of yourself and really uh so it's amazing how someone can act and talk so spiritual yet they're blinded to discern their s and really on how they're living be so hard on others and miss it on them themselves and so I and I don't want to overplay this Viewpoint this morning because I want to come to another Point here and uh also I wanted to just say something here for a moment because I've heard a little something a little rumor within the church and it's come to me a couple times of some of you sisters that speak uh not so nicely of your husband don't do that remember you married that guy how's it make you look it's like so say good things okay don't you ever be degrade him or whatever belittle him in any way no because you know what listen uh he's your husband protect him he's got faults he may not know it but he does have faults and I'm sure that through a few years you will help him see his faults that's why you have a wife and uh so anyway the Lord help us and please um be careful and that goes with the husband to the wife or the wife to the husband say good things about one another you know so much of the time we can see what's wrong with everybody else but how is it that we are blinded sometimes to discern ourselves we're blinded to ourselves and our own faults and failures so much of the time and if we're care we're not careful what happens we get festical religion in other words we look at everybody like a fery h I'm glad I'm not like so and so I'm glad I'm not like him because we measure ourselves by ourselves and when you do you're it's not wise we may you want to measure yourself measure yourself up to the word of God Amen then you'll find out that we all fall short then we all cry Grace then we all say oh lord it's just you I'm only going to make it because of you and we won't get this stuffed arrogant uh attitude about ourselves and looks uh uh and get some self-righteous way about ourselves but hey but for the grace of God there go I in Luke 18 veres 9-14 Jesus had been speaking some Parables and he spake a parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despise others something's wrong with this picture buddy when they trusted in themselves they were righteous and looked down and despised others and two men went up to the temple to pray the one a Pharisee the other a Publican and a Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers and even as this Publican I fast twice in a week I give tithes of all that I possess and the publicans standing a far off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smokee his breath saying God be merciful to me a sinner and I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be a based and he he that hum humble him self shall be exalted God help us that we don't ever get some kind of self-righteous we're better than someone else type attitude somebody say Amen am take off your Halo this morning and let's be real amen Christians aren't perfect they're just forgiven amen if we have any Perfection it's in Christ amen thank you Lord It's not the way of our dress it's not the way we Act and the things we do but it's by faith in God and that is a gift of God lest any man should boast thank God for Faith it is a gift amen I'll show you another portion of this in Matthew 7: 1-5 judge not that you be not judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again and why beholdest thou the moat in thy brother's eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye and I looked at the beam and the moat and one is a little speck of sawdust and the other is a log so here is this graphic this description here why beholdest thou the moat this little this little sliver that's in your brother's eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mo out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast first out the beam out of thine own eye then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out the most out of thy brother's eye show you another portion of scripture here in Luke 6: 41-42 and why beholdest the moat that's in thy brother's eye but perceivest not I want you to look and see that one it is perceiving and Discerning everybody else but doesn't perceive himself how sad wouldn't it be a terrible thing to be a Christian have a self-righteous attitude and look down and despise others when Hey where's the love of God in our hearts what about fellowshipping what about huh and but perceivest not the beam that's in thine own eye either how C thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the moat that's in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first The Beam out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt clearly pull out the moat that is in thy brother's eyes see if we would discern ourselves we're so busy being Discerning of others and critical of others and criticize others that sometimes we can't see the forest for the trees talk about somebody else's family well what about yours amen I'm just kind of talking down home this morning help me Lord to just and I want to ask you this question because this is a major question because Moses asked God who am I have you ever asked yourself the question really who am I right because you got to know who you are in order to take your position in order to be a servant of God you need to know not only who listen to me right not just know who he is right but you got to know who you are I want all of you to understand you can be raised around the message you can hear and see all of the supernatural there can be Visions there can be the pillar of Fire coming all signs is Supernatural and you can say wow this is amazing but what's that got to do with you Thunders and Lightnings and voices and angels and appearing and things and signs and wonders happening all over but what about you who are you right in the sign the sign of this time in 63 brother brand there's not a person living but would like to look past the time the curtain and where did I come from who am I and where am I going three major questions and it doesn't come to you because you were raised around the message you were raised in a Christian Church you were raised in a message home because you can have all of those lined up and still not have your identity you need to know who you are is this message for you you got to wrestle with the angel yourself you can't get up here and get a blessing and say I'm going to live off of that blessing you need to have the solid Revelation and the foundation that is laid only upon Him hallu amen thank you Lord who are you where' you come from why are you here for what purpose do you have here in life right of all the fine books that's read the Great Master selections that's been may there's only one book that reveals who you are and where you come from and where you going right that's it that's it it also lets us look past the curtain to see it your true identity does not come to you from your natural birth your true identity does not come to you through your natural parents it com to you with the new birth experience coming from God your father because a carnally minded man is enity with God and neither can he not understand the things of God for they are blinded to the things of God does not the Bible says that the God of this world hath blinded the eyes and the minds of them that believe not I ask you what kind of person are you why do you believe what you believe what's all of this got to do with you seven angels seven Thunders Seven Seals so what I ask you who are you what kind of lineage you come from what does this got to do with you I don't want you to make this some kind of religion I don't want you to make it some kind of way of life you could become a an Amish you could become a menite you can change your church and I'll tell you what a life lived is better than a preached sermon God let us live a life that others around us will want what we [Applause] got amen let us have the spirit of Christ amen you cannot come to your true adoption and placing in the body until you know who you are let me emphasize this when you know who you are then you can be positionally placed within the body because a doubl minded man the Bible says is unstable in all his ways who are you ask yourself that question you may know about God intellectually you may you may talk about his greatness you may have studied his word like a Pharisee and it just became a religion there are millions of people today around the world that say they know Jesus and how that they love him many will honor God with their lips but the Bible says their hearts are far from him in vain do they worship him it's not just confessing to know him let me emphasize this it's knowing who you are am many people say oh yeah yeah I know Jesus and you live like you don't know him Jesus said if you love me you keep my Commandments we do not do his Commandments to have eternal life we do because we're in love my wife serves me because she loves me we serve God because we love him and the life that we live is an expression of our love back to him amen the identity of who you are Lays in the revelation of who your father is the new birth is your identity you know we've been going to doctor's offices and this and that here lately and everybody want can I see your ID please want to know who you are I ain't taking your word for I want to see your ID in German Al I want to see your ident ification and you can tell me you're a message believer let me see your ID you know who you are oh you can talk about the prophet you can talk about all the signs you can talk about this and that and you've been here and done that you can wear a revelation 10:7 belt buckle that don't make you no message believer you can have T-shirts you can put bumper stickers on you Paul said to those Jews a Jew who is not a Jew is not a Jew who's one outwardly but a Jew is one who is won inwardly God help us to have the inside working on the outside not the outside trying to work on the inside cuz you can wash up you know what a Pharisee does he washes up the outer part of the cup but the inside is filthy any of you ever gone to a restaurant and you get a cup it's filthy on the inside or still got lipstick on the the cup you look at I ain't going to drink out of that we strained a n swallow a camel God help us look at our lives I want you to discern yourself I want you to look at yourself this morning how do you look in the eyes of God how are are you doing good this message is an encrypted message yes sir there's a message within the message it is the same with the Bible otherwise everyone who owns the Bible can understand the mystery of God and understand God himself but I'll tell you it is a hidden book it's a sealed book it is only it is only given the deciphering of of the mystery to those who are elect am so I ask you who are you you must be some kind of special people if God if you're catching anything in this end time now about what God is doing in this hour oh quit talking about Jesus 2,000 years ago quit talking about way back a god of History the one thing about this message has brought God out of history right down today he is the same yesterday today and forever because if God ever did something way back then you watch you come under the same condition and watch that God do it [Applause] again he's the same yesterday today and forever you don't know God by mere studying your Bible you don't know God by human and intellectual reasoning you don't know God because some man taught you from some kind of Seminary or theological teaching you know God because your Father revealed himself to you amen yes sir brother Brenham said in is this the sign of the end sir just hit some highlighted portions here in Matthew 13 in the 11th verse he answered and said to them because it's given to you his disciples given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to them to them it's not given and the Mysteries here the mystery a mystery in scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the Revelation let me say this we have got a message of the hour and we have got books and tapes of many of the things that has been done in this hour supernatural angels I don't need to go on and expound on that you know what I'm talking about but there is a supernatural element that remains despite the message or the revelation of God and that means that each one of you a supernatural element God needs to move upon you yes you you need to find out what is this message is it for you cuz I have some that sit there and they well I don't know I've just been raised around I really don't know well you need to know cuz there's coming a purging very soon there's becoming a Rapture of the church and God's going to take his bride away and the foolish virgin's going to get left and for three and a half years of a tribulation it's going to be hell on Earth oh God help us to know who you are but then help us to know who we are who are you that's right what does this message mean to you right do you even listen do you read do you pray do you seek the mind of God or do you let your pastor do your homework for you don't make me some holy Pope come up here and light a candle for you say a prayer come up here and we we might as well get you know everybody in robes and candles and the big uh cross and we walk up here and eam [Music] sp22 do this and everything and now I feel holy that's religion I remember the first church I ever went to I never been in a church my friend Joe Zino he asked me you want to go to the Catholic church with me yeah okay fine never been in one I thought wow that's amazing my parents they weren't religious people Jesus Christ was a cuss word so I went and and I saidwell what do you do well I'm I I you know you follow and do what they do right so he walks towards the front entrance and there's a little bowl with some water he touches it and he does this I thought H okay I do this I actually felt a little holy I did I I F I don't know what it did but and and then they come to where you have to get into the Pew area and you have to genu flect you have to get like oh okay wow this is amazing so we like this and they have they have a a printed out little thing that you follow here's this and you repeat and here's this and you repeat and stand up uh sit down stand up and all this and I'm going wow I can't wait and so I'm waiting for the Holy Father whoever it is is to come out because I want to hear a sermon and I told you before and and he he started speaking and he spoke for about 10 minutes in Latin Latin you got to be kidding me any of you take Latin in school I took two years of Latin yeah britania EST insula de Vista inart wow none of you knew what I say you probably knew Britain is an island divided into three parts what I'm saying is when you don't understand what the preacher's saying are you sitting there this morning or during services and the preacher's preaching and it's Latin to you or it's Greek to you it's going right over your head well let me tell you brother br said inside of every elect seed is an ability it's not the preacher giving you Revelation it's not anyone giving it to you all of a sudden there is something on the inside that said I Heard a Voice of God he was speaking to me yes sir you're hardwired by the DNA of God himself h brother Brenham said it's called the SE Gene of God my sheep thank you Jesus he that hath an ear yes are you understanding it's an encrypted message because it's not for everyone this message is not for everyone neither is Christianity right but to those who are a El those who are the Sheep of God guess what it's me it's for me it's mine I believe it that's what believers do they believe don't try to get me to explain it I can't explain it I just [Applause] believe amen super natural element remains each one of you need to have this super natural element into your life it'll change you yeah it'll stimulate you amen begin to see the evolution of God brother random said God's an evolutionist he believes in evolution he said not the way science teaches it not the way Darwin teaches it but he said watch God in his great Evolution he said there he was he wasn't even God he was just a spirit he dwelt alone in eternity and he said there in the womb of his mind where God creates cuz that's the Inception place and so he began to create in his mind and he wanted to be a savior wanted to be a redeemer all of these thoughts he wanted to have a family he wanted to have children he wanted to reveal himself and he began in his mind and he began to evolve and he said and then the logos came out of the very Mind Of God which is the thought of God and the Loos became flesh amen and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us God who was a spirit who we cannot understand and we can't relate to because it's a spirit how can I love something I can't see how can I love a God I don't understand so he said I will evolve myself down I will make myself visible I will come down and I will make myself known to you and you shall see me with your hands with your eyes you'll feel me with your hands you will know that I am he Hallelujah the evolution of God see the prophet says I believe in evolution but not the way the modern scientists say God evolving himself down and so God here it is in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ follow along with me and so God manifested in the beginning finally he appeared as Jehovah God the Father then he appeared as God the son in Jesus Christ now he's appeared as God the Holy Ghost the same God all the same three manifestations of the same God not three different gods same God just like Evolution come he created body life first then he created animal life next then he created human life next kind of an evolution Rising higher so it has been in God and his church now he's taken the very thing that he said Evolution and it started with boty life and then it goes the animal life and then fining to the image of God God evolving it's the evolution of God so it's been God in his church justification under Luther watch God he's evolving he's bringing the church higher he goes to Luther H pulling the bride out follow along he's creating bride justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley so forth you see the evolution of the spirit being given more and more because the body is building coming to the head which is Christ the body of Christ because Christ is the mystery of God revealed Eve was the mystery of Adam revealed and the bride of Christ is now the mystery of Christ reveal sir amen thank you Lord who are you ask yourself who am I it's all part of the evolution of God God condenscending down God is a spirit in the sermon who is this Mount kzdc it's like a sculptor takes his PE piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off it and there it is that's what the Bible has been it's been the work of God that's been covered up it's been hid since the foundation of the world and it's Sevenfold mystery and God promised in this day at the age of this Lan church he would take the mask off the whole thing that we could see it what a glorious thing God in morpha masted in the pillar of fire god in morpa in a man called Jesus God in morpa in his church God above us God With Us God in us God you see the condenscending of God up there holy no one could touch him he settled upon the mountain even if an animal touch touch the mountain he had to die and God come down changed his tent come down lived with us and become one of us and we beheld him the Bible said 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh handled with hands God eat meat God drank water God slept God cried he was one of us beautiful typed in the Bible but God was above us God was with us now it's God in us the Holy Spirit Hallelujah are you seeing the condenscending of God this is God evolving what is he doing he's cloning [Applause] himself therefore who are you what manner of man and woman are you right he commanded the wind the waves he calmed the storms and the disciples said what manner of man is this I want to ask you what kind of manner woman are you let us sink very deeply God is the spirit and the word became flesh we know know that God became man the spirit of God went from the body of Jesus Christ at Calvary he gave up The Ghost and he said it is finished and he bowed his head the newas the Breath of God left but what it did it just transferred to another body it went from a one one membered body to a multi-member body the body brother renham called the mystical body of Jesus Christ because his holy spirit amen will only enter into his body not another body his body it'll be bone of his bone it'll be flesh of his flesh as Eve was a part of Adam so is the bride a part of the word it's a word birth Hallelujah not another body his body evolution of God God In His Infinite Mercy placed within you a seed Gene and you either have it or you [Music] don't you don't talk somebody into it going to church doesn't change him because Genesis 1:1 says every seed will bring forth of its own kind do you understand that that is a law of God so I ask you if God were to have a son or a daughter what would they be like who am I is this message just rules and regulations to you or is it your identity Hallelujah brother said in samian church age Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes he is a son some of you are slow excuse me but it's true and any teacher that's got a classroom full of kids some kids catch it before the others it's all right just a fact of life Son of God can go a long time that mean you can be raised up around the message you can be raised up and parents telling you and hey it it happened with Jacob Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he hears all the stories but G guess what all of these are just stories to Jacob the Bible says and when Jacob was left alone think of that when Jacob was left alone sometimes that's the best thing that can happen to any one of you is when there's no friends there's no family there's no this and that and you're left alone and all of a sudden God gets all of you sir take a long time to recognize who you are in fact a lot of true Christians are like the story of the baby eagle hatched out under a h you know that eagle is the type of the True Believer somebody say amen amen farmer took an egg from an eagle's nest placed it under a hen do time all the eggs under the hen hatched out the baby chicks got out got along fine with the mother hand but that little Eagle could not figure out all the clucking and scratching for food in the manure po huh he managed to make a living but he was pretty confused about it all I can say Amen to that but one day from way up in the air the mother Eagle had laid the eggs spy that little Eagle on the ground she swooped down with her tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up to meet her you never heard an eagle cry but when he heard that first sermon something in him stirred sorry I make this personal and he longed to launch out toward it but he was afraid to try again the mother screamed for him to rise in the wind and follow her he screamed back that he was afraid once more she called out screaming that he tried beating his wings he hurled himself into the air and answering the Cry of his mother he soared off into the blue skies you see he always was an eagle he acted like a chicken for a little while but he could not be satisfied and when he heard the call of the Great Eagle he came to his own place he see a once a true Son of God hears the Cry of the Spirit by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet who am I why did just listening to a couple messages turn my life that's right around wasn't raised around it wasn't raised in church but all of a sudden when I heard the voice of that seventh angel when he began to sound there was something inside of me there was an identity that I'd never heard I saw a reflection I knew who I was that's what it's all about watch cuz the prophet had come to this Revelation too watch this yeah because you know what listen I remember I'm told on the day of my birth that there was an Amber of light that came in through the window and hovered over my the mother's bed there and he said there I was born and there were the Amber fire of God and all of this stuff and that the parents not being religious oh he said oh my they begin to wonder there's something special about this boy he says I begin to grow up I begin to hear voices I look up in a tree carrying water for my father's moonshine still don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way for when you get older I have a work for you to do why he says I run home mama thinking I had maybe a sunstroke what is all he says I'm on a bus and a woman behind me a ssir says do do you realize there's an aura hang you realize that can tell you the day you were born stop this stop leave me alone I don't understand this even when he became a missionary baptist his own Pastor told him said you know what all these visions and these voices and you seen Angels it's of the devil he said I I I don't want a devil he goes and he starts he starts praying he starts seeking God who am I what is all of this about he says there I was by myself in a little little Hut he says I hear I hear footsteps coming into the room he said this is the first time I ever saw him physically I had heard his voice but this the the first time I had seen him in physical form there he stood about 6 foot all of complexion he says I've been sent from the presence of almighty God to tell you that your peculiar birth and the things that are happening to you is for a purpose wow who am I Moses said the same thing he saw the pillar of fire God speaks to him supernaturally out of the midst of the fire Moses Moses here I am take off your shoes for the ground that you stand on is Holy Ground Who Am I who am I that God who am I that almighty God God would want to have me as a son brother brandham said in communion 1965 follow along what was it there was another William brandham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the very the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working even when I can't see him he's working when I can't hear him he's working see what what make this personal Now look up in the trees leaf I seen you fall last year why you come back there again where'd you come from what what brought you here it was eternal life working in the body now then one day I walked on that voice talking don't never smoke drink so forth the young fellows and all older see there was something moving but yet all at once I looked up and I said I am not the son of Charles and ell brand there's something calling you see that he said who am I I am not the son of Charles and El brandom he said there was another William Brandon I want you to know that you have a twin you have an eternal part of you that looks just like you you all of these angels and spiritual dreams coming to him God pulling him to know his identity of who he was who am I am a ignorant Kentucky hillbilly I don't have more than a seventh grade education and you want me to preach and and pray for kings and monarchs who am I God was pulling him to his identity Beyond his natural birth Go West Young man cuz there's seven angels you're going to meet with seven angels you're going to be caught up into a constellation what's that got to do with you is it just a story have you made it just some kind of yeah Noah in the ark is not really a reality the true church begins to catch a true revelation of who she is catch that true church true Revelation catch who she is you understand that identity I want you to discern yourself this morning who are you what are you doing here King David asked the same question and I'm going to close with a few of these scriptures but this let this resonate with you this morning if you get nothing else I want you to ask yourself Who Am am I what's all this other stuff got to do with this because you just might have God in a supernatural way yeah yeah like that man when I preached over there in Poland he was a Russian been kicked out of so many different churches he kept asking I know God's got something for this age there's a message or's something because as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot God you got to have some and this guy he's praying he's fasting he's asking God God show me what's happening in this hour he's got a little one room apartment there's no toilet there's no s there's just a bed a small chair and a little nightstand with a lamp on it and and there's a pencil he's got a pencil so he can make notes he said I've been praying and I've been seeking God and I went to sleep just thinking about God and what he's doing in this house he said something shook my bed he says I I awoke immediately I turned on the the the lamp oh what is that what did who who he says I I felt a little strange what was that he said I began to pray I thought well maybe maybe I dreamt it maybe it wasn't really real went back to sleep he said this time his bed shook almost violently like like somebody waking you up to go to school in the morning he said I turned on the light no one's there he says I'm thinking Oh my he said I got out of bed I knelt I prayed he said oh God I don't understand he said please show me he started getting tired it's early early morning gets back in bed and this time he said that there was two hands I grabbed the hair of my head and shook me he said I jumped out of ited he said there stood an angel he said I was sent from the presence of almighty God to come tell you that he sent his Prophet messenger in this day his name is William Marian brandom spoke perfect Russian and in Russian script he he doesn't even look around for a piece of paper he takes his pencil and he writes on the wall William Maran brandham and Russian my he's so excited can you just imagine can you just imagine huh and so he's he's going around now Church to church who's William brand who's William nobody knows nobody knows brother YY CC who was a brother from from Poland there in volova we were having these meetings and so they had a sign of the pillar of fire above brother rand's head and showed his picture and showed the cloud and different things and said end time message meetings preaching the doctrine of William Mary and brandham and it was a poster and YY ctech went over into Poland or excuse me into Russia from Poland and he stapled it on some telephone polls or whatever this man walks by and when he sees the name William Mari and Brandon what do you think he does you think he got excited he saw the dates two weeks away and while I was preaching every time I'd mention brother brandham this guy would stand hallelujah praise God I'm thinking who is this guy the end of the story is he he couldn't wait hey hey he's speaking Russian I don't speak Russian you speak Russian I don't speak Russian I need a translator well there was a brother who spoke Russian and polish so we got the guy but then didn't and so he went from Russian to polish to German to English finally they go so the guy tells me the story let me tell you supernaturally if you go to asking God God reveal yourself to me hang on hang on buddy cuz I'll tell you what if you're sincere don't play with God God is no clown right he waits until you're sincere and if you're real sincere and you want him let me tell you you might have an angel come to you you might hey there's an angel speaking to you this morning and he's been from behind his Pulpit what is all of this about evening Life Fellowship message of the hour Seven Seals seven Thunders seven voices rapturing Faith end time message what's it all about what's it got to do with me who am I King David says the same thing I'll show you 2 Samuel 7: 17 through 22 now Nathan's been speaking to him and given him all the words of the Lord and visions you catch this now according to all these words and according to all this Vision so did Nathan speak unto David then when King David in and sat before the Lord now he's having a private time he said who am I oh Lord God and what is my house that thou has brought me hither to why have you done this why you reveal this to me who am I what is this message all about what are these visions and this and the prophet coming and giving me thus sayeth the Lord verse 21 for thy word's sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things to make thy servant to know them that's why God did this that you might know him David didn't understand all these things happening are you kidding me he's just a young boy out here he T tending his daddy's sheep kills a lion and a bear sons of Jesse Samuel do you have another he went from all the ones son no God reject him you got another son yeah little old shrimp of a guy out there in the he's tending my sheep well go get him here's a little David coming walking up Samuel says thus sayith the Lord this is him anoint him to be king over Israel David's going who am I I'm a Shepherd boy do you know this was [Music] years before he became king you think he walked around all the time I am going to be king he didn't know who am I I'm just a little Shepherd boy then Nathan comes to me words of the Lord Visions who am I what is this got to do with my house and why am I brought hither too 1 Chronicles 17 let's look at another scripture according to all these words and according according to all this Vision so did Nathan speak unto David and David the king came and sat before the Lord who am I oh Lord God and what is mine house that thou has brought me hither to same thing look at this exactly oh Lord verse 19 for thy servant sake and according to th own heart thou has done this all this greatness and making known all these great Mysteries oh Lord there's none like me wow who am I oh Lord I ask you who are you this morning is there something inside of that c Gene of you that's pulling you to know your identity seven Angel Messengers brought the quickening power of the revealed word in their day and when those thundering voices made themselves known every elect seed caught the Revelation for that hour when Luther began to say the just shall live by faith every elect seed the just shall live by faith and they caught it what was it the quickening power of God they begin to realize who they [Applause] are Wesley On and On The Messengers down Through the Ages every one of them bring bringing another portion of the great mystery of God that's been hid down Through the Ages yes what is it Paul said it's the Christ amen the mystery revealed in you amen who are you what kind of DNA you got this message is encrypted to you amen got your name on it I don't know about you but these messages every one of them I say that's my messag in fact this message was my identity absolutely amen yes just like that little boy who had never seen a he only seen a little portion of a mirror Mir never seen a full face they just had in you know poor little Kentucky family just had a little portion of a mirror one day he went to his Auntie's house and she's got a full-blown mirror she's got a big one little boy walks in the room he looks in the mirror little boy raises his hand everything he does he does he's think who is that is that me when you heard the sermons of brother Brenan did you say is that me that El seed is that who I am is that who he's talking about it's me I can't hide it any longer it's meall amen amen little boy all of a sudden caught the Revelation Mama it's me this little boy caught the Revelation too I said Lord it's me that's why you send the message that's why you've done all this oh mo my brother my sister this message is more than Doctrine it's life it's identity it's me coming to myself yes that part of me that never fell that's the aony that Eternal thought that was in God's mind catches up cuz you bypass your theophany you came down in this world speaking lies you was born of a sex birth he that's born of the flesh is flesh Marvel not that I say unto you you must be born again I was born of my father and I realized then who I am that's it this is my inheritance this message was for me I don't about all of you maybe it's not for you talking to a young boy the other day I said hey it's not for everybody well I've tried and this and that I said well maybe it's not for you see I'm not here to baby talk you and sweet talk you in and get you to maybe persuade you not nonsense it's either for you it's not as much as you want to make everybody El like seed sorry but if you are all that the father hath given me will come you might come screaming kicking crying through a knole backwards but you're coming God is bringing you to your identity God is bringing you home [Applause] there's no place like home who am I I don't just identify with this message it is my identity first Samuel 18 musicians if you come I'm I'm closing oh I wish I was a good preacher 1st Samuel 18:12 Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with him and was departed from Saul therefore Saul removed him from him and made him a captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people and David behave behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the Lord was with him wherefore then Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of of him but all Israel and Judah loved David because he went out and came in before them and saw see a life lived a life lived is better than a sermon preached that's why yesterday during the memorial service there was family that knew Dave way back there was something about his life wasn't he didn't sit there and explain to them the Seven Seals he lived aive and years later they come stand behind here I there was something about Dave I tell you I know what was about Dave Dave knew who he was he didn't care if anybody believed it or not he knew who he was was I ask you do you know who you are Saul said to to David verse 17 behold my elder daughter Meb her will I give thee to wife only be thou Valiant for me and fight the Lord's battles for Saul said let not mine hand be upon him let the hand of the Philistines be in other words I'll put him out in battle he'll die by the hands of the Philistines I don't have to kill him he's God's anointed I'm afraid of him let let the Philistines do it and David said to Saul who am I what is my life or my family my father's family in Israel that I should be a son-in-law to the king wow who am I I ask yourself that question this morning 1 Chronicles 29 I'm closing with this scripture wherefore D David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and said blessed be thou Lord God of Israel Our Father forever and ever thine oh Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in heaven and in the Earth are thine thine is the kingdom oh Lord Thou Art exalted as head above all both riches and honor come of thee thou reignest over all and thy hand is power and might and in thy hand it is great to make great and to give strength unto all now therefore oh Lord God we thank the and praise thy glorious name but who am I he's just been praising God for all his greatness his power his might but he ask who but who am I and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sore for all things come out of thee and of thine own have we given thee for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as we're all our fathers our days on Earth are as a shadow and there is none abiding wow who am I what is my [Music] people how can I build you a house what house will you build for me one of the last sermons The Prophet preaches what house will you build for me I want to discern I want you to I'm going to challenge you discern yourself this morning what has this message done for you what does it mean to you is it just a long [Music] dress or is it an an identity what's it what all these angels and visitations Supernatural and thousands and thousands upon Visions what's that got to do with [Music] you are they just stories or is he the same yesterday today and forever if you would ever ask to make himself known to you I'm not going to ask you this question but I'm just going to say you know in your lives supernaturally God [Music] has has revealed to you he has shown you things you've asked him for signs and he's given them to you how many can say Amen brother Ron he's done it because he's the same yesterday today and [Music] forever I just got to thinking about this scripture who am I and as I began to research through the message and I began to research Through the Bible there it is King David said who am I Moses who am I and here I am in

[Music] [Applause] praise let everything thing I [Applause] pursue be pleasing oh Lord unto [Music] you come here sweetheart you know we've been uh through some trials the know Devil's stuck his head up I've been going through it with my wife but she wants to tell you present stage go ahead mil hold it up hold it up so they can hear first I thought I'd share this little thing with you is is it on test test there we go okay God bless everybody but I wanted to share with you actually Ron wanted me to go ahead and share it but when I um when I first um found out I had cancer and I laid my hand on myself and I re I rebuked the life out of the tumor and then an inspiration hit me and the Lord told me you go ahead and he just put it on my heart to go ahead and speak it and I said so then I rebuked I rebuked it might sound silly to you but I rebuked the life out in the name of Sandy Peterson and the and then it just came to me and the Lord showed me he said you've got the authority I I got and you know what I I just he said sign the check so I signed the check and I got to thinking like brother brandham he talks about the policeman and um well the policeman he's got the authority but he doesn't put up a sign as saying the name of Phoenix the City of Phoenix he just puts his hand up and um it's like if you I don't know if you've ever heard this on tape before but Ron and I've heard it where brother Brown's praying for people and sometimes he's like be healed and he goes to the next person and he never says in the name of Jesus Christ and I realized it's because the authority was there he knew who he was and you know and I thought to myself you know what I feel like when I think about the Lord you know you think a lot with your husband and you people say your soulmates but to me he's really my soulmate but anyways to get to the testimony so um anyway we talked to the doctor and you know the doctor and Ron decided the best thing for me was to have the surgery and have the tumor taken out so I did that and then the um pathology test came back and actually the lady called me and you know so they take lymph nodes and you know they actually call it a partial masectomy and um anyway it came back and she said this is what she said to me you're cancer free they found [Applause] so it's it's it's all glory to the Lord and um and It just fits with the surface and so you all know you can do the same thing but anyway I just want to tell you how much I love the Lord he means everything to me and I want to glorify him for his greatness am yeah yeah

Lord if he calls on me I'm going to tell him tell the congregation what you put on my heart this morning I was up early praying and I said Lord what I just I couldn't pray I was just such a a tension such a pressure all around me this morning I thought well I'll just listen to a tape so I typed in 63 in the table and I'm thinking now what what message should I listen to this morning before I go to the church I came to the message why Christ speak brother vam gets up you know and he's he's reading he's talk talking about Moses he's being a perfect type of Christ and he's giving all of these examples and he just it just you know he's talking about a sister that just had a wreck a car wreck and there was a lot of things that that was on the prophet's mind and you know he was concerned about the people and their condition and the things that they're going through and he's mentioning all these things and he reads the scripture he's going through the things and then all of a sudden he started talking about what God did through his ministry and what he saw and I got to think you know that's that's I I think that's a key there I think what we need to do is we need to start talking about what God's done for us we need to start speaking it and say you know what I used to be a sinner I was I've been saved by the grace of God let me tell you what God did for me and God did this and God did that and God did this and God did that and next thing you know something's going to happen down on the inside a faith starts to grow a an atmosphere is being created all around you and next thing you know the glory of God is you and you think well boy I don't really have any problems after all hallu well that Cancer's gone I don't have any problems I've committed I'm a Child of God I
