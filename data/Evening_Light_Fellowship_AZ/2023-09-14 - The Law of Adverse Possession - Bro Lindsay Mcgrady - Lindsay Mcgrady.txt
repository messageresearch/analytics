the Lord thank God thank you Jesus thank you Jesus if he wasn't in the house there would be no reason for us to be in the house but because he is in the house there's every reason for us to be here yes sir I don't know what you brought to church with you tonight I don't know what kind of problems what kind of issues what you're facing what you're going through but I believe there's one here that can change it all amen amen no matter what you're going through praise the Lord I appreciate him I love him and it is good to be here good to feel his presence amen I never feel failed to feel the presence of the Lord when I come to evening light it's just such a blessing I love your worship it just it's a it's it's like a bomb of Gilead spiritually just to come in and receive that and I probably need to be there more than I need to be here just to receive that and it's it's just a blessing but while you're standing if you would turn with me over the book of Second Kings the e8th chapter I hate to dismiss the musicians because so beautiful music Second Kings the 8th chapter and then we're going to take one verse from Matthew the 11 the chapter certainly hatte it brother Ron's not here I always look forward to seeing brother Ron and uh enjoy fellowshipping with him and just uh have a high regard for brother Ron his uh his he's just you know Spirit The Humble spirit that he has it's just it's a blessing to be around not everybody's that way God help us all to be more like that amen Second Kings the 8th chapter starting in the first verse it says then SP Elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn whatsoever thou can adjourn for the Lord have called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cist to the king for her house and for her land and the King talked to jhaza uh the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha have Elisha have done and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life Cried unto the king for her house and for her land and gahasa said my Lord O King this is the woman and this this is her son whom Elisha restored to life and when the king had asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even unto now now just one verse over in Matthew the 11th chapter Matthew the 11th chapter the 12th verse and it says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force let's just by our hearts Heavenly Father we just come tonight Lord we give you honor glory and praise Lord and it is such a privilege to be here in your presence dear God and all that we say is that we love you we appreciate you we need you Lord we need you to minister your word Lord this is not my word dear Lord it is your word and so Lord allow me to get out of the way that you may speak to every heart Lord I know there's some that may be tired and weary and body Lord maybe they had a difficult day maybe their things that are uh that they're dealing with de Lord Jesus God you know it all we just come right now asking that you would bless you would Minister Lord touch each heart touch each life dear Lord and God we'll be so careful not to give the glory to a man but Lord to give all glory honor and praise to you for all that you do we thank you we praise you we just ask these things in Jesus Christ's precious name amen God bless you may be seated tonight you you know this woman that we read here from in 2 Kings the 8th chapter we know her as the shunamite woman which was Barren and had no children but because of her uh willingness to uh hear the prophet that God had sent to him because she was willing to make accommodations and make room for the prophet of God in her life that God was merciful to her opened up a be womb gave her a son we know the story that as a son grew that he was out in the field with his father one day and he cried out my head my head and fainted and the father took the son to the mother and he died upon her lap and then she rode to Elijah and cried out you know and and Elisha come and laid upon the child and and the Li's child was restored and that's the story that Gaza here uh the servant is telling the king as this woman is in the court and she had done what the prophet had told water he said there's a there's a famine that is coming in this land and so you know you need to you need to make Provisions you need to go somewhere you need to sourn somewhere that you can go to to find uh relief during this famine and she'd done that but when she came back to her home I guess much to her surprise here she finds someone else that is occupying her home in her lands while she's gone you know nobody's home nobody's there she thinks hey I'll I'll I'll move we'll move in we'll take over we take control and she finds that now being uh a widow at this point being uh you know having maybe a small household and a son you know maybe she didn't have the provisions or the means to try to take back what belongs to her so she went to the she goes to the king and she brings her petition before the king and and you know it's not a coincidence there's a lot of things happen in her life that are not coincidence and it was not a coincident the Gaza was there telling the stories that as he tells his story he looks out and there's that woman crying out for what belongs to her amen so and he said that's the woman this is the woman this is her and you you know the story read the story here now let me just let me just take this bring this around just a little bit here to our thank you brother Mark to where we're at today and where we're living today if you drove home tonight from this church service and you pulled in a your driveway or your Ranch whatever you might have and you notied hey there's here somebody's pulled in a camper and they're parked in my yard or they're parked beside my house and you know I don't know who these people are they they they've hooked their they've hooked up to my water spet on the side of my house they've run a h a cord and they hooked into my electricity they' set out their lawn chairs and I would say they build a fire but you don't need one out here right they they don't need a fire just fry your eggs on the sidewalk or whatever listen the Bible tells us over the Book of Revelations the third chapter to our all to see in church I would that thou were hot amen y'all have arrived y'all have made it okay y'all have made it youve made it amen so you know you but you see amen they just made yourself all they pulled into your property they don't you don't know who they are you don't know what's what's going on and and I don't know maybe maybe you you you uh maybe maybe you don't mind I I I don't know but I I don't how would you respond to that you know here's somebody that is pulled into your your back lot or whatever and they've hooked up to your utilities and they've got a camper in and you don't know who these people are you know that would probably challenge your Christian character yeah I mean you know you'd try not to get red in the face you'd try to be kind and gentle but that that probably wouldn't last very long and uh but so you could you could imagine amen somebody that is there what would you do what would you how would you respond I mean you know you you might first say well let me go over and talk to these people and say Hey you know I don't know where maybe you're supposed to be at maybe you think you're at somebody else's place this is mine this is not your Uncle Bill's or whatever you know you're at the wrong place or you you might try that but if you didn't get anywhere with that and they said oh no this is where we're supposed to be we're staying here you know and so on you know probably the next thing you do is go in a house and call Maricopa County Deputy department or Sheriff's Department whatever and say Hey you know I got some people transp you probably would take action as this shite woman did I mean she sees somebody is encroaching upon what belongs to her and she says you know I'm not just going to tolerate this I'm going to do something about it amen I'm going to I'm going to take action against this and so you know there's a thing called and this is the title of the message tonight is the law of adverse possession and I'll tell you a little bit what the the law of adverse possession is because every off 50 states have some version of adverse possession you know some people call it squatter's rights but the technical term is really the the is adverse possession and and so knowing I was going to preach this here tonight I looked see let's see what Arizona's law of adverse possession is and according to Arizona General statute 12- 521 you can write that into your notes if you want to it defines adverse possession as an actual and visible appropriation of the land commenced and continued under a claim of right inconsistent with in hostile to the claim of another so in other words you know what you're sitting there I'm paying a mortgage on this piece of property and here's somebody else has tried to move in on it amen on your property so they're trying they they're there adversely they're not there by your permission they are they're on your property and they're they're trying to take control now also in Arizona every all 50 states their their law is a little bit different uh than some you know each one they each state is Sovereign and they've got their different laws but under Arizona law five 12-52 and 12- 526 a party claiming adverse possession has the burden to show that his or her possession was one hostile two exclusive three actual four open and notorious and five continuous for the statutory period of 10 years so if that person stays on that property they have no claim to that proper if they stay there with meeting those five conditions and they have to prove those five conditions then they can take claim to that piece of property that's adverse possession now in North Carolina you got to do it for 20 years we're not quite as nice to squatters you know you're going to be there 22 years in North Carolina and prove those basically s five things you're hostile so it means you don't have permission to be there you're exclusive means you're not doing it with a a party of people it is you or your family whatever it is actually you actually are in possession of the property opening Ator you're not doing it you're not hiding the fact that you're trying to take over someone else's property you're not slipping in you know and and encroaching on the property while they're gone to work during the day no you're there openly notoriously and you're doing it Contin iously for that t period not not that hey you know what I'm going to go over here I'm going to try to take what oh brother Mark's got a nice place there and he goes to Canada everol them so I'm going to slip he's gone to Canada I'm going to slip up there in his property to try to take adverse possession well you know he comes back in a couple months say well I got to go until he goes again it don't work it's got to be continuous open adverse continuous I mean so this is this is the the law of adverse possession now in that most States also have what's called a color of title does that make sense to anybody color of title some of you brother Ezra is shaking his head yes some of you know what color of title is well let me read to what color of title is color of title refers to a document other instrument that appears to be a legitimate claim or title of title to a piece of land but due to a title defect cannot transfer or convey ownership maybe that deed was never properly recorded and somebody thinks hey you know this belongs to me and I've I I've got a piece of paper here I've got a a deed but maybe it's never properly recorded maybe the taxes weren't paid uh it was for closed on sold to somebody else and yet they they've got a deed or maybe something says they inherited the property whatever it may be a color of title now in Arizona if you've got color of title you only have to adversely uh possess the property for two years two years now before anybody in here gets any ideas that this is a good way to go get property we are Christians and that would be stealing right that would be stealing I mean somebody come and took your property you would think hey they're stealing this from me because I've been paying the mortgage and they're taking this away from me so we as Christians we don't do that right amen so but we see now North Carolina if you've got color of title it's seven years so again we're not quite as generous as you are out here in the southwest now so we see amen that that somebody's doing that we find a woman here this udite woman that she comes back home she finds out that somebody's been on her property these seven years while she's gone they possessing her property and she's got to do something about this she doesn't doesn't accept that now this we're speaking in is of the natural but let's bring this around to where it's applicable to all of us which is in the spiritual realm right the Bible tells me in John the 10th chapter the 10th verse says the thief cometh not but to steal to kill and to destroy that's what the enemy comes to do that's this enemy he wants he's a thief amen so he wants to take what belongs to you he wants to take what is your god-given right he wants to take what God has blessed you with and adversely possess what belongs to you now listen if he has color color of title he has a right he has a right amen prophet of God told us in the message inspiration 19556 he said I watch solemnly everything to see the first version or Vision excuse me what God will say do for you might Stomp and kick and anoint and everything else and if the devil has a right in there anything in your heart that's unconfessed or any unbelief or any doubting anything in there anything that you refuse to do or not the devil will lay right there cuz he has a right to he a color of title to come on and to trespass within your life and to take the things that belong to you amen so if he's got a color of title amen you know what you can come up and say pre Preacher Brother Ron whoever please pray for me I've got this going on Amen but if that devil has a right to be in your life because you've opened up the door to allow him to stay in there amen the preacher can SN Stomp and snort and and pour oil whatever else brother brandham says here to do amen and it will not work because the devil's going to lay right there as long as he has the right to do so he's got a claim in your life amen so if he has that claim if you've given him that opportunity to make a claim you can try to fight against enemy all you want to amen but you've got to do something about what gives him the right to be in your life amen now I'm going to tell you something the devil attacks every single one of us right amen first Peter the 5th chapter amen the eth verse says be sober be vigilant because your adversary can you point a finger at yourself and say my adversary my adversary he's your adversary you have an adversary you have someone that's out to do detriment to you spiritually physically emotionally mentally to to steal to kill and to destroy right he is your adversary we cannot forget amen that we have an adversary that we're fighting every day we don't see it amen the trouble is sometimes amen we see the wife instead of seeing the adversary behind the wife amen don't don't any of you Brothers elbow your wife that's not what I meant heyen but you know you we we see the neighbor that is being adverse to it but we don't see the adversary the devil that is behind the neighbor we see the person on the job amen that is that is doing something amen detrimental to us amen but we don't see the devil and the devil loves to hide behind people he loves to hide behind skin amen and we we fail to see a lot of times that it's a devil that is doing the attacking amen instead of it's not it's not my neighbor it's not my uh uh my family or whoever it is it's it's the enemy amen so you've got to remember amen be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil the Bible tells us your adversary my adversary is the devil the opponent that is trying to destroy me trying to destroy you is the devil amen the one that is trying to take possession of your god-given inherited rights and I ain't talking about the constitutional rights of the United States I'm talking about your your scriptural rights amen is the Devil he's the one that is out to do these things against you so be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring line walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom he's whom he can consume or swallow now I want you to notice in this scripture it uses the term May amen May implies right not the ability whom he may whom he has the right to consume whom he has a claim to someone's life or to come into someone's home maybe the door is open in someone's home and he comes in and listen if you know the about you you've heard the say and giv me in she takes a m you open the door he walks in you know uh he's he's there constantly trying to barge his way in so you know he he's seeking whom he may who he has the right Amen to come into their life to try to do detriment to your life he is our adversary so we recognize that the scripture tells us Ephesians the 6th chapter the 12th verse we wrestle not against flesh and blood too often we're engaged I mean we want to we we want our battle to be with somebody that we can see amen instead of the one we cannot see the devil that is working behind the scenes we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen so that's the one that we are constantly engaged in battling with uh uh on a daily basis and if you don't recognize that if you don't recognize he's the one that is coming against you or coming against your children uh coming against you emotionally playing games in your mind remember the prophet of God talked about the greatest battle ever fought was here in this in this the mind the Mind Games of Satan wages if we fail to recognize that then he's going to have the upper hand against us I mean one of the greatest strategies in war is the the element of surpris right the enemy doesn't know that you're there and at the last minute you spring the attack whenever they're least expect and when Satan tries that on a daily basis with Believers and so that's that's the adversary that we're facing but the scripture here goes on in this 1 Peter the 5th chapter The 91st say whom resist steadfast in the faith so you have an obligation to resist this enemy and you're not doing it in your own intellect you're not doing it in your own strength or your own ability says in the faith you are standing in the faith when you get outside the faith and you start trying to uh uh uh to fight against the enemy outside of the faith you are on his ground you are fighting in his territory amen but here the scripture says you resist him steadfast in the faith that is Our obligation now let's go back to adverse possession if someone has moved on to your property and and you do nothing in that designated statutory period they will take title to what belongs to you so for you to prevent that you have to take action you can't ignore it think well you know what I I'm going to be the good guy and you know I I'll just hey you know we'll we'll tolerate this and and they'll just get tired and they'll pull away we won't have to go to court and we won't have to do all these things no if if that person stays there persisting for the statutory period of time they meet those five conditions they can take title to that piece of property your property what belongs to you and that's exactly what the devil is trying to do amen there's things that belong to you amen that he is trying to take away from you amen amen he wants to rob you of these things he is the thief amen so for you you you must take action against this enemy you must resist him in the faith Amen to prevent him from taking what belongs to you you know he take away your peace he'll take away your joy amen he will make you Restless amen he'll make you unsettled amen we've got that today a me people that are unsettled people that are not established and so forth and the enemy's doing that the Bible tells us Amen in Ephesians the 4th chapter 27 verse neither give place to the devil you don't make you don't make concessions with the devil amen you don't you don't compromise with the devil you don't say you know what you can have this little little section over here me you don't give him that am because he's never satisfied with just a little bit amen he wants it all he wants everything that you haveen so you have got to resist him you've got to never give him a PL you got to resist him you got to take action against him unless you want him to take what belongs to you amen see that devil that that that that pulls into your front yard he wants to hook into your water supply he wants to drain you dry Hey listen you may live in a desert but you don't have to be dry are you with me amen no matter how hot it may be outside don't mean you got to be dry on the inside but if you let that devil come and pull his camper into your life and hook up to your water supply he is going to drain you dry amen you cannot allow that you've got to resist that and you know what else he wants to do he wants to plug into your power source amen so that you become Weak and Powerless amen you can't allow the enemy Amen to come in and take control in your life amen you have to resist him you have to resist him amen so we see that amen we don't we don't allow him to take control do whatever he wants to do amen Revelations the the 12th chapter very familiar scripture here in the 10th verse it says and I heard a voice saying in heaven now has come the salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused him before our God day and night we know who that is that is the devil that is that one that is trying to steal away from you he's there trying to accuse you know he's trying to make his claim Before the Throne he's trying to come and say well look God you know here here's here's this brother and and you know that he on on on August the 2nd that he told a lie well that's not you that's mine that's my claim that is my I put that claim on here you you see this sister over here you know that you know she she did this or this brother did that you know he's the one that's accusing I mean look at this I mean he was accusing amen day and night he was making his claim against you and so he's making a claim he's saying this this this belongs to me it is my right Amen to bring misery to bring sickness to bring defeat amen all these things things and into this individual's life amen so he's making that claim that he has that right to do that against you before the throne doing this amen but thank God for the next verse the 11th verse and they overcame him who overcame him we overcome him right they didn't say Jesus overcoming in in this and me they overcame now I know that he defeated the devil he the devil is defeated amen but we've got to overcome the claim that he's trying to make against us and so here is he's making his claim and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and so in other words here's the Devil he's Before the Throne trying to make his claim uh uh to get into his right to get into your life to do what he wants to do well you've got to have a testimony amen you something to say about that you've got to be able to come and say well hey wait a minute I got something to say I got a testimony I got something to side God let me make my claim in this situation right so if if it's what the devil says and and versus what you say you know it's your word versus his word right and the scripture tells us you've read it in the New Testament Jesus quoted in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established well that comes from Deuteronomy the 19th Chapter and the 15th verse where that is in the Old Testament I wanted to read that it said one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin in any sin that he sinth at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three Witnesses shall shall the matter be established so it's not just well it's my word against the devil's word is he standing there day and night you know and and he said well you know Lindy MCR he did this on such such date and he did this on this date and he did this on this date and and he's he's got a big thick book you know and he just keeps saying Li is you know that's what he's saying so I said oh wait a minute you know so my testimony has got to count in there somewhere but ends up being my word against his word and so there's got to be more to it than that but the word testimony here that we read uh in this uh Revelations the 12th chapter and 11 verse it's an Evidence given a record or report a witness so you know our our report has got to be against what the enemy's report is when he's making the claim but he is trying to adverse possess what belongs to you we've got to have a testimony that says otherwise Our Testimony has got to be different amen our testimonies has got to be something greater because you know what he comes he trespasses he wants to take away your health he wants to take away your joy he wants to take away your peace he wants to take away your your power he wants to take away your spiritual benefits he wants to take away your spiritual Heritage he wants to take away your children amen he wants to take all these things away from you I I had a little bit of a re Revelation the other day we we we Sharon and I we we got a little rental house we don't want to be landlords I don't like being a landlord but it just it's in front of us and I knew that if it it was going up for sale I bought it because I knew if I didn't somebody else control it and I don't like being a landord I don't like fixing my commode let alone had to go fix somebody else's okay just plain simple and so uh but finally after five years the the renters moved out and so I went down the other day to I went down the other day to to to start measuring Windows to replace windows and so forth in a little real house and I walked in and it was so filthy it was awful it was awful I I literally we took a shovel and was shoveling I held away three pickup truckloads of big trash bags I mean heaping just in in two hours when I get back home I get to go back do a whole bunch more than that you know and and it was just it was awful I was like I was like you know this is this is terrible I mean you know animals don't live this filthy animals there was no animals in the house animals this was people they don't people I mean animals don't live that filthy and you know I I say hey God created us in His image the devil perverted us into His Image that's what the devil did and that's how some people they don't live like animals they look like live like Devils filth amen they they they don't mind the filth and so forth amen but that's what some people thrive hereen that's what God intended for us and the devil wants to take all that away he wants to take all the blessings of God away from your life amen he wants to take the anointing of God away from your life amen but there's got to be a testimony against that enemy amen no matter what his claim is amen your testimony must claim what belongs to you this is mine amen this don't belong to the devil this is mine it was bought for me amen it was purchased for for me a I didn't purchase it the peace that I have it's not my peace it is his peace my peace I give unto you amen amen so it don't belong it wasn't M I didn't work it out amen Jesus Christ amen he worked it out for me he gave it to me it belongs to me amen that is my testimony amen amen you've got to receive that amen you can't just let the enemy take it away from you amen the Bible tells us in James the 4th chapter and sth verse says submit yourself therefore to God and resist the devil and he will flee from you you got to do it amen you know I I I've tried it as a as a pastor as a minister I have tried to resist the devil for other people if that person doesn't do the resisting it does no good for me brother Ron anybody else you get whoever it don't matter amen it takes that person's got to have their will their will has to be interjected amen into the equation amen it doesn't do for me just to try to resist the devil in your behalf amen we can do that we can try amen but if if your will is to allow the enemy to come into your life amen I can't override that and and the prophet God said the Holy Ghost doesn't override that doesn't override your will amen so amen you have to resist the devil and he will flee from you now so you've got a testimony you've got to have a testimony of what belongs to you amen what is yours what is your right what was purchased for you Hebrews the 3D chapter the first verse says wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly call and consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus our profession brother Bram send the message it is I be not afraid he says and now is your faith in that finished work that does the work that's the way it is you confess it and he's the high priest of our confession he cannot do anything to you until first you confess that you accept it that you confess what he said by his stripes I was healed then then he's the high priest to make intercession Upon Our confession so you amen you've got that's where your testimony comes in amen you've got to be able to say hey you know what this belongs to me amen that that is covered here the devil say you know what Mark Mark brother Mark did this he did that what he didn't call you brother did he you know brother Mark did this he did that amen and so you you've got to say wait a minute the blood of Jesus Christ amen cleanses me from all sin all unrighteousness that becomes my testimony it is that well you know this is what I did or this is how good or listen God he's not exactly right about that I was I was seduced into that no you're just wrong right amen but there's one thing that cleanses you from all unrighteousness and that is the blood of Jesus Christ praise God Amen so your testimony amen so you've got to to make the testimony because he is the high priest of your confession or your profession what you profess what you say amen he begins to act upon and he said then he said first you've got to profess you that you accept amen then he is the high priest to make intercession Upon Our confession in the the message the results of decision brother says he's the high priest of our confession Hebrews 3 and any of you Brethren know that Prof confess and profess there is the same word so he's the high priest of our confession he can't do nothing until first we confess that he's done it amen and see what the devil wants to do he wants to make you feel bad he wants to bring the guilt upon you you know and how can you pray you know what you did how can you pray how can you go to church don't you go to church you're just being a hypocrite see that's what the enemy does you know it comes with those thoughts to you because he don't want you to start confessing by his stripes I'm Healed he don't want you to start confessing confessing the blood of Jesus Christ right so he he's trying to keep you from doing that amen but he can't he's saying Jesus can't do any can can't do nothing until first we confess that he's done it right you know if you're sick you say well don't wait till you feel better to confess your healing that's no longer Faith right oh well it's gone I'm Healed no you why you at your worst when you can't hardly raise your head amen when you can't even get out of bed put your feet on the floor I want you to know that's when you start confessing your healing amen that hey I may be flat on my back and I don't have the strength to get out this man but devil I want you to know that I am healed by his stripes I'm healed amen amen that's what you got to do amen that is Faith praise God it's not after the fact because he can't do it for you until you confess it you start putting your testimony in him listen you know it's so good to be here with Josiah first some sharing and I've got to be in church with our grandson but back in North Carolina we got two little granddaughters and the oldest one are 2 and a half years old and and and you know I didn't have sons so you know I Sons I had Sons didn't have daughters being like wait a minute what

pushovers or whatever I never understood that I mean you you become a pushover and she's saying that little please and and you just give in and here is our testimony as the bride's testimony has got to be to the bridegroom amen amen you know what it will not be refused used hallelujah amen you've got to make that confession of whatever the need might be amen the Bible says in Hebrews the 4th chapter and the 14th verse it says seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession no matter what you're going through amen no matter how hard it may get no matter how difficult it may get no matter how bad you may feel like giving up falling in a towel amen you hold fast your profession because you have a high priest that is there he is speaking in behalf of your confession amen he speaking beh of what you're confessing so you just keep confessing amen no matter how you may feel no matter what you're going through amen don't you don't you compromise with the Enemy amen don't you give him any territory amen amen so now we we said there Revelations the uh uh we read there the 12th chapter and that the 11th verse that we overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony so the blood of the Lamb amen is the purchase price of the redeemed amen amen that's what he he paid for you and I amen he paid that price now you know your attitude towards something maybe if you you found that person when you get home that is on your property again hey I'm going to work every day and I'm paying a mortgage and and do I like getting up and going to work work no I don't stay home or or or whatever amen but no I'm I'm working to pay for this what are you doing on my property right I mean because you're paying for it it belong it's it's it's yours right I mean you're paying the taxes you're paying the insurance you're paying the mortgage whatever and here's somebody's trying to take that away from you heyen I want you to know something there was a price that was paid for us hallelujah there was a price paid for your Liberty there was a price paid for your salvation there's a price paid for your joy there's a price paid for your peace amen all these things amen for Revelation for truth amen for the for the the word of the hour amen there's a price that's been paid for these things why would we let Satan come and take it away from us amen it's a greater price than what you go to work for right sometimes amen we we all I'm working for this amen so you're not getting any of it amen well let me tell you something what about the price he paid for what belongs to us why would we let Satan try to take that away from us now I had a little bit of an epiy there while I was shoveling things off the floor and and and my wife was holding a trash bag and I'm Shoveling there out of that rental house and it just filth I mean stunk oh it was awful it was awful and I had a little bit of in I was mad I'm just going to tell you I was upset I I was aggravated I don't know if I was flat out mad but you know I I I I was having visions of renter's neck you know I just that I mean I'm just can I be brutally honest with you I mean I know I just tarnished my halo didn't I I am sorry please do not think bad about me because you know you'd have thought the same thing right I I just think about this filth and how can anybody live like this and you know what and here's what even made the insult the injury is I'd went down before the the wife and the the kids had moved out and the man's still there and I I took down these big industrial trash bags and and he went there and just set them inside the front door there so hey why you're here before you get out just you got trash just put it in the trash bags I'll haul it off so I'm not so bad see when I walked in and there's filth everywhere he had took my trash bags he left the filth and a trash but he took my trash bags I called Sharon I said Sharon go to the garage get those trash bags out of the garage and bring them down here you know and she brought them trash bags down you know what she did she we got back in the vehicle went back up to the house she didn't leave me she went back up to get gloves because she wasn't going to touch it you know but I had epony as I was as I was shoveling that filthy had stunk so bad I mean you're trying not to gag you know oh you know and all of a sudden it hit me that Jesus Christ waited into the filth of my life that's right he waited into the filth of my life I know we love to Pat ourselves on the back till we get calluses but I'm going to tell you something he I he raided into the filth and the stench of my life and gave his life to clean it up he died cleaning up the filth of my life that's the price he paid for me and I I was thinking about so oh God how much worse was that than what I'm doing right now God how much worse I mean don't you think I mean you you get upset you get out of the way all a sudden God brings it back to you that's what he does right amen so all of a sudden I felt about that big said oh God it was me it was my field D you come into my life and you cleaned up a me you waited you died cleaning up the filth of my life which was far worse than what I'm cleaning up right here right now amen thank God for his Mercy you thank God for his grace thank God for the sacrifice you thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ amen that cleanses us from all unrighteous that cleanses us from all sin praise the Lord amen not that we deserved it amen hey I'm not patting myself on about if I when I step in heaven it'll not be because of anything that I did right it'll not be because I deserved it be because he paid the price don't ever forget it amen and the price that he paid when we allow the enemy take away what belongs to us amen we're letting him Rob we're letting him blaspheme or or defame the sacrifice that Jesus made for us it means I don't care have you ever seen some rich kids that get everything you heard of being born with the the Golden Spoon or the Silver Spoon whatever color spoon is I think I had a a toothpick stuck in my mouth when I was born that's why I got the Gaff in the front teeth and so but you've heard of people being born with a silver spoon right I mean the kids get everything I mean you remember the kids that go to high school and they're driving a new BMW or whatever going to high school really I drove a 1974 Pinto station wagon with wood grain panels God knew I needed humility and that'll do it for you okay but you've seen people like that right but they have no appreciation for what has been given to them if anybody gets in trouble they're going to be the ones that get in trouble cuz they're trash it they don't care about it how could we be that with the blood of Jesus Christ how could we be with that like what he bought for me how can I disrespect the sacrifice that he made just to let the enemy come in and try to take it away from me not to contend I mean you know it say in the book of Jew says contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the you cond it means you're fighting for what was once delivered to us you're fighting for it it means enough that you're going to fight for it you're not just going to let it be taken away from you me so don't let the enemy just come in and try to possess what belongs to you now so we see amen that the scripture tells us there in Revelations the 12th chapter it was not just our testimony but it was the blood of the Lamb amen that we overcome the Devil by that he was defeated by the blood of the lamb now Hebrews 1224 says to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel so here's the blood that was paid for us and we know that that blood that was that paid the debt for us was put upon the mercy seat and that mercy seat if you go back into the old test find that Mercy Seat was at the throne right was at uh the ark of the covenant was at the presence of God here it is at the right hand of God so here's the enemy that's standing before God accusing us there but here here's of blood sitting there at the throne on The Mercy Seat and this Blood speaketh better things than that of Abel Abel's blood was crying unto God from the ground but here's the blood of the Son of God Amen crying out at the Throne of God what is that blood crying out it's crying out your testimony he is crying out what you confess he is the high priest of our confession so whenever I'm saying I'm speaking my voice is speaking through the blood at the Throne of almighty God amen you got to realize you got a voice at the throne amen amen at the throne in the presence of God your voice speaking through that blood amen what you're confessing I am healed by his stripes I am healed then eny sitting there oh she did this and he did that but the blood said oh they're forgiven the blood saying they're they're forgiven amen the blood saying I paid it all I paid the price they're forgiven amen oh the the accuser of the Brethren there day and night accusing us before God the blood your testimony and the blood amen crying out Mercy Mercy Mercy amen they are forgiven praise God they are healed Hallelujah they are delivered ammen thank God you have a representation Before the Throne we're sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen we're crying out that blood praise God Amen remember Prophet God said amen that he said God's not looking at you amen what's he looking at he's looking at your sacrifice he's looking at the sacrifice he said if you can find anything wrong with the sacrifice but there's your sacrifice Jesus Christ I mean representing you before the throne amen so your testimony the blood of Jesus Christ amen making the difference in the message why brother R says and be and because sin broke the blood cell and let out that spirit of God that fell on the day of Pentecost now the worshipper when he puts his hand upon the lamb and receives forgiveness of his sin the life that was in the lamb which is God's own life comes back to the believer and he becomes a Son of God Sons and Daughters of God then he's the in the family of God Amen so amen there it is that life that was in the blood amen it comes back the spirit of God comes back Upon Us amen and and in 1 Corinthians the 6th chapter the 20th verse says for ye are bought with the price therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are gods have me so you've been paid for in the message the token brother bam said it's alive now making Vindication and because he is we have the right of all he purchased for us a man that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost or a woman that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost has a right to everything that Jesus purchased for us to that's the sign that we have that's the buying power praise God Amen so he bought a because you become a Son of God the blood amen the life that was in his blood amen it comes on you it gives you rights to everything he purchased for youmen so I can't say well listen I deserve peace I can't say it's because I deserve Joy can't say it's because I deserve eternal life it's not because I say I deserve Health it's because what he purchased for me amen I have a right to that praise God Amen unto what he has bought for me everything that Jesus purchased for us you have a right to that Satan don't want you to have any of it Satan wants to take all of it away from you if you'll let him if you'll sit back and do nothing he'll take everything away from you but you've got to resist him your testimony through the blood of Jesus Christ and amen has got to be a witness amen Ephesians the the first chapter amen the 13th verse says in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of our salvation of your salvation in whom also that after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen so here it is I mean you you're sealed by that Spirit we know that amen and not only that amen but it becomes it's just an Earnest of what belongs to you amen of until you're R till the Redemption till we're out of here it's going to be so much better it's going to be so much greater than what we have here what we're going through here what we the best day here will never compare Amen to to what we're going to have there amen so amen he's purchased for us Romans the 8th chapter I'm I've got a lot of scripture I'm going fast I'm just about to get this thing done Romans the 8th chapter give me just a few more minutes the 16th verse he the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Jesus this way you suffer with him that we may also be glorified together amen so amen we become HS amen that you see what belongs to him amen it we become joint HS of that we become HS of God the things of God Amen so that's what Satan wants to take away from he don't want to take away from you a a a a nice little piece of property out here in the desert he's got greater aim than that he's got a greater desire than that am mean he wants to take away your your salvation or he wants to take away your joy your strength amen these things is what he's trying to do so we see here amen that according to that scripture we read in Deuteronomy the 19th Chapter the 15th verse that one witness amen cannot bring establish a fact against another but it has to be by the mouth of two witnesses amen or by the mouth of three Witnesses shall every matter be established and so here's Satan making a claim against you that he's trying to take what belongs to you your testimony amen that's one the blood is two Hallelujah the spirit itself beareth witness with us amen that we we are the children of God that's three in the mouth of two are three Witnesses amen let every matter be established amen so the devil is defeated because one but your testimony has got to be first you've got to be the first one to say hey I confess it I'm confessing what Jesus Christ amen not what my mind says about me not what I feel amen but what the word of God says about me I'm confessing the word of God because if you went by your feelings you'll always be defeated amen right if you go by what you think you'll always be defeated but if you go by what the word of God says about you amen that is your confession and your confession you confess the word of God it is comes through the blood of Jesus Christ the high priest of our profession amen and then amen that blood that we are believing in the light is in that blood the witness of the spirit the spirit is witnessing amen that yes amen that one belongs to me that one is mine amen they don't belong to the devil they're mine praise God hallelujah amen so in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established now winding this down real quickly here we started off in 2 Kings the 8th chapter the shite woman and she comes before the king and she's crying out there for what was hers what belonged to her and just so happened there was the servant there that says hey you know that's the woman she's the one that's her right there amen that her son was restored to life and so forth and the King gave her audience but the king didn't stop with just giving her an audience he said in that sixth verse it says in that 2 Kings 8 chapter 6 verse said he said so the king appointed unto her a certain officers say restore [Music] all Hallelujah that was hers now listen you may have allowed the enemy to take something away from you but the king says restore all that was hers yeah you may have lost it you might have temporarily vacated it and the enemy has come in and encroached upon it the enemy is coming in and trying to adversely possess it but the king's got the final say thank God we serve the King right amen hallelujah amen so the king says restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even unto now in other words I want you to go back over the seven years she left seven years ago and whatever her property would have produced over that seven-year period that she was gone amen I want you to give that to her as well now how do you beat that what a deal that is right amen that's pretty good right amen so here it is the king is interceding on her behalf that she receive amen what she had lost and more and that's what God is able to do for us amen because every one of us every one of us know that someplace in our life we've given up things that we shouldn't have given up that's right maybe maybe some of you of your children are not here with you tonight maybe maybe there's one that's out in the world or whatever that youve the enemy's com and snatch that child let me tell you something God can restore that child you claim that amen you claim that right under the blood of Jesus Christ you profess it you claim it amen that it belongs to you amen that that's a son your a Son of God or a daughter of God you claim that amen and God is able to restore that God is able to take away or to restore all that the enemy took away he's able to restore all that the Palmer worm and the the caterpillar a the Locust all that they destroyed our God restores that's the thing that he does and so the enemy may have been working in your life to try to steal something away from you let God do the restoring work let God show you amen but you know how you started you started with your testimony your confession that this is mine yeah I made a mistake yeah I I I I I got out of church I did this I did that but you let God do the work of restoration in your life now I I want to close I want to go back to where we started over there in 1 Peter the 5th chapter where it says says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a or line seeking whom he may devour whom you resist steadfast in the faith right knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world if musicians will come back so we didn't read that part we didn't go that far you know your your your obligation here's this enemy this his adversary that is attacking amen whom you resist in the faith amen but he goes on saying knowing that the afflictions that he's putting upon you the the afflictions that the enem is attacking with are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world am me so you know what you're not the only ones going through something that's right how often does it seem like whenever something happens in life we're the only one going through it nobody else is is going through what I'm going through nobody else is putting up with what I'm putting up nobody else has ever been through what I've been through the scripture says knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that is in the world Amen so you know what there's people that's gone through what you're going through amen and theyve gone through it right they've been through it amen they're not steing but they've been through it amen so God is saying you know if you been through it amen I I if they've been through it I can bring you through it as well praise the Lord so that enemy that adversary he's afflicting whether it's physical mental emotional spiritual however Satan is trying to attack you and if you're serving God the devil is there trying to attack you don't forget you have an adversary the devil so he's trying that against each one of us amen if you're a son or daughter of God he's trying to attack you right if you're not a son or god daughter of God he don't want you to become one that's right I mean he don't want you to surrender to the Lord he don't want you to yield to the Lord amen so whom you resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplishing your brethren that are in the world the 10th verse we're closing with this says but the God of all Grace who have called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus he's called you aren't you glad you've been called not not called Amen to to Eternity in am americop of Valley thank God right amen but you've been called amen unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you've suffered a while now you put these three scriptures together you got an adversary he's attacking you he's afflicting you you're resisting him he's afflicting you amen but the God of all Grace who have called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you've suffered a while yeah you may have to go through suffering because if we suffer with him we shall also be glorified with him he we read over there Romans the 8th chapter so sometimes it takes some suffering to bring us into that glorious image of Jesus Christ just like when I'm there shoveling and I'm upset and I'm angry uh uh at that and all of a sudden he speaks to me in that dreaded place and condition and showed me how much worse it was what he paid for me what he did for me so see I I was suffering but it brought forth a revelation amen so you know you that after that you've suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you so whatever the devil is trying to do the the devil's trying to attack you you don't just allow him you resist that devil amen you've got a job and a responsibility I've got a job and resp responsibility to resist that devil but yet what he's doing against you is going to bring you to a state of perfection it's going to establish you it's
