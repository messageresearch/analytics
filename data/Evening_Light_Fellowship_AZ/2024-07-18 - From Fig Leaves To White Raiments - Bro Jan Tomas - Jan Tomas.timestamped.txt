[25:48] you amen God bless you all uh I'm
[25:52] bringing greetings from our fellowship
[25:55] in Liana we're just a small group gr but
[25:58] then again we are a group group of
[26:02] Believers of this end time message
[26:05] Believers of God and uh we also are
[26:09] visiting sometimes to the neighboring
[26:12] country which is the country of Croatia
[26:14] the capital city of Zagreb there are no
[26:17] many Believers there but sometimes We
[26:20] Gather there you know Believers from
[26:23] different parts of Croatia gather there
[26:26] so we have regular meetings also in in
[26:29] Zagreb so I'm bringing the greetings
[26:31] from Believers from Croatia as
[26:34] well uh I will say now this is live and
[26:38] I'm not meaning about the streaming but
[26:42] uh I'll I'll give you a little secret so
[26:45] uh I have a full-time job so not many
[26:49] times uh I'm in the actually uh can
[26:54] prepare for a meat uh week service so so
[26:58] what I do I actually invite some
[27:02] preachers pastors from around the world
[27:05] not very many I'm really picky who to
[27:10] invite and uh one of the well pastors
[27:14] that we invite many times is Pastor Ron
[27:18] Peterson what we do we we we just take
[27:22] certain services from the archive from
[27:25] your archives and we actually just play
[27:28] and listen to them so we know
[27:31] you we know you better than you think
[27:36] we uh and I'm saying that uh with all
[27:39] the let's say humility because we really
[27:43] enjoy we enjoy not only your pastor
[27:46] brother Ron
[27:48] Peterson uh we enjoy the service we
[27:52] enjoy the worship service and you know
[27:55] the way I see it is we feel the presence
[28:00] of the Lord when we listen to those
[28:02] recorded Services now imagine you have a
[28:06] live service here and the presence of
[28:09] the Lord comes down and then we listen
[28:12] the same service like three four weeks
[28:14] maybe a year
[28:17] later and the same presence of Lord
[28:20] comes into our room that's why we
[28:23] appreciate you so much because if your
[28:26] right your spirit would not not be right
[28:29] then the presence of the Lord would not
[28:31] be here and would not be in the room
[28:34] when we listen to so we love you we
[28:37] appreciate you very much again many many
[28:40] greetings and love from from our local
[28:42] congregations and may God richly bless
[28:45] you amen would you introduce your wife

[29:21] you and uh we have three well grown up
[29:24] boys uh the oldest one is 29 and and the
[29:28] middle one will be 27 in a couple of
[29:30] weeks and the youngest one will be 25
[29:34] again in a week and a half so we are
[29:37] very blessed Lord has blessed us
[29:40] immensely and uh well that's the love of
[29:44] my life
[29:46] so may God bless
[29:54] you amen we when we go over to Serbia
[29:58] and that part of the country there with
[30:00] brother Yan Thomas uh brother OS and his
[30:05] wife and the the boys they come and uh
[30:09] you know when you meet somebody and uh
[30:13] they have that spirit that connects with
[30:16] your spirit that's how I felt both with
[30:19] brother Yan and brother uros and uh uh
[30:25] so we are just so very very pleased to
[30:28] have them this is their first time for
[30:30] both of them to be in the United States
[30:33] so this is you have only one chance to
[30:36] make a uh an
[30:38] impression
[30:40] and we're not trying to impress as far
[30:43] as you know look at what we got or
[30:45] whatever because you know everything
[30:47] that we have is a gift from God God gave
[30:50] it to us God God is good is he not amen
[30:54] and uh we are blessed because He blesses
[30:56] us amen he is our Victory he is our
[31:00] strength he is our shield and uh so um
[31:04] brother Yan Thomas he uh is here with
[31:08] his wife sister Anna and sister Anna
[31:11] would you stand up so the people can see
[31:13] you God bless
[31:16] you and uh um so anyway let's change the
[31:21] order the service let's everybody stand
[31:25] now and you know Saints of god um
[31:29] brother Brenham said that our theme
[31:32] song uh we all know what it
[31:35] is and it's an anointed song around the
[31:38] world no matter where you go because how
[31:41] many times when the prophet of God was
[31:44] coming to the
[31:47] [Music]
[31:49] pulpit you hear
[31:51] [Music]
[31:53] that and he was saying because the angel
[31:56] of the Lord had told the prophet if
[31:59] you'll get the people to
[32:01] believe how many of you say I believe
[32:04] tonight I believe amen and we're just
[32:08] thankful to have ministers that believe
[32:11] this message amen okay these men have
[32:15] learned
[32:16] English and everything one of the main
[32:19] reasons not only just because it's an
[32:22] international language but because of
[32:24] this message so they hear it
[32:28] directly even from the prophet's own
[32:32] tapes amen
[32:35] only
[32:37] be let's raise our hands
[32:41] [Music]
[32:47] now all things are POS
[32:55] [Music]
[33:06] be
[33:08] holy
[33:11] be for all things are
[33:18] possible
[33:20] holy now let's sing Lord I
[33:23] believe yes Lord I
[33:30] believe
[33:32] Lord I
[33:36] believe all things are
[33:43] possible
[33:45] [Music]
[33:48] I
[33:50] Lord
[33:54] I
[33:56] oh I
[33:59] [Music]
[34:01] all things are
[34:06] possible
[34:11] Lord amen H Allelujah you may be seated
[34:15] for just for a
[34:19] moment amen I want to thank brother Ron
[34:22] for this nice
[34:24] introduction and uh everything he said
[34:27] is nothing but but the
[34:29] truth yes we we know brother the r at
[34:32] least 15 years and uh we're just uh
[34:36] recalling a lot of memories uh sitting
[34:39] together but uh
[34:42] really I was just want to say a couple
[34:45] of things like an
[34:47] introduction uh yes we also have a small
[34:50] group in Serbia which is um uh in sobia
[34:56] we have only two fellowships so the
[34:57] message so it's really precious to have
[34:59] Believers in one place gathering
[35:01] together and because of that we really
[35:03] appreciate every Ministry which came uh
[35:07] to like support and help the people and
[35:10] I can say brother Ron was much more than
[35:13] a blessing for the people there so if uh
[35:16] you would mention in our country and to
[35:19] the Believers of this message in Serbia
[35:23] uh about some things like uh what is
[35:27] that in America like uh Grand Canyon or
[35:31] some waterfall or some any any other
[35:34] Memorial Place uh but the message
[35:37] believe would say in America there is
[35:38] brother Ron
[35:40] Peterson so we we we we we just have
[35:45] that opinion like uh National Treasure
[35:47] of
[35:48] [Laughter]
[35:51] America so that's how we love him uh not
[35:55] to make him big okay we recognize the
[35:57] the gift of God given to the people uh
[36:01] Believers not only here but worldwide
[36:03] and he really was a blessing many times
[36:06] for us we could draw so many things and
[36:09] the people felt so good you know and we
[36:12] could tell testimonies after
[36:14] testimony but yes that's true and I'm
[36:17] glad personally to know him and uh he
[36:20] really blessed me many times so uh
[36:24] greetings from all the Believers from
[36:25] Serbia to you and we app appreciate and
[36:28] thankful that you had have let him go
[36:30] many times because maybe you needed him
[36:33] but you were ready to sacrifice so we
[36:36] want to thank you also and it's not in
[36:38] vain you blessed many people just
[36:40] because of the minister belon even
[36:42] sister Sandy when she was there she left
[36:44] such an impression on many sisters like
[36:47] really many were so impressed and they
[36:50] they couldn't believe such a simple and
[36:52] uh wonderful believer you know and uh a
[36:57] wife of minister they were really
[36:59] impressed so we thank also sister Sandy
[37:01] and to all of you and uh yeah I wanted
[37:07] to mention some other things also but
[37:09] now it uh just uh slipped away from my
[37:13] mind but uh I don't want to take too
[37:17] much time I would like to share some
[37:19] thoughts uh from the Bible and uh uh
[37:22] from the message just um to somehow
[37:26] connect with you I believe that you
[37:29] really uh cherish everything what
[37:32] brother Braham preached and the Bible
[37:34] and I didn't come to preach something
[37:36] new to you but just to maybe emphasize
[37:39] some things in the Bible and the message
[37:41] which you already know and um uh brother
[37:45] R is really uh a great example also for
[37:48] me and uh he is 30 years of marriage you
[37:52] can still learn from him really um a lot
[37:56] uh me and my wife are this year 25 years
[37:59] of marriage so we somehow also have a
[38:02] anniversary and we have four children
[38:05] and uh all of them by God's grace are
[38:08] believers baptized and following the
[38:11] message and supporting so it's only the
[38:13] grace of God you know some of them came
[38:16] very quick our youngest son Andrew he
[38:18] was only 10 years but he wanted to be
[38:21] baptized earlier even and uh the last
[38:25] one came uh when he was
[38:28] 21 or something like that 22 just
[38:31] recently but uh still God's grace is the
[38:34] same you know and sometimes you need to
[38:37] have patience with your children and um
[38:40] pray and believe that the promise is
[38:42] yours claim it and after time it just
[38:46] happens you know so that that's it so if
[38:51] you will maybe take the Bible and have a
[38:53] look in some
[38:54] scripture it's in Genesis we can stand
[38:58] and for the reading we will find the
[39:02] third chapter of Genesis from the
[39:05] sixth
[39:07] verse until
[39:10] 13 so Genesis
[39:13] 3 verse six familiar
[39:22] scriptures if you if if you found I will
[39:25] read from the sixth verse and when the
[39:27] woman saw that the tree was good for
[39:30] food and that it was pleasant to the ice
[39:33] and the tree to be desired to make one
[39:35] Vice she took of the fruit thereof and
[39:38] did eat and gave also unto her husband
[39:41] with her and he did eat and the eyes of
[39:44] them both were opened and they knew that
[39:46] they were naked and they s soed thick
[39:49] leaves together and made themselves
[39:51] aprons and they hear the voice of the
[39:54] Lord God Walking In The Garden in the
[39:56] cool of the day and and Adam and his
[39:58] wife hid themselves from the presence of
[40:00] the Lord God amongst the Trees of the
[40:02] garden and the Lord God called unto Adam
[40:05] and said unto him where art thou and he
[40:07] said I hear thy voice in the garden and
[40:09] I was afraid because I was naked and I
[40:12] hid myself and he said who told thee
[40:15] that thou was naked hast thou eaten of
[40:17] the tree whereof I command thee that
[40:19] thou should not eat and the man said the
[40:22] woman whom thou gavest to be with me she
[40:25] gave me of the tree and I did eat and
[40:28] the Lord God said unto the woman what is
[40:30] this that thou has done and the woman
[40:33] said the serpent begal me and I did eat
[40:37] amen let's bow our heads for prayer dear
[40:39] heavenly father we are so thankful for a
[40:42] new opportunity to be here together
[40:44] worshiping you Lord and praying and as
[40:47] the prophet said every time we open the
[40:50] Bible we can have a new vision and may
[40:53] this just open our eyes to see some
[40:56] things in the Bible and in the things uh
[40:58] in the message your Prophet preached
[41:01] that we really be encouraged to
[41:03] understand why is it important to stay
[41:05] here to be together in Fellowship to be
[41:08] together on the road of God and just
[41:10] prepare for the greatest event ever will
[41:14] come and that's the Rapture of the
[41:16] chosen ones we pray Lord that you help
[41:18] us anoint us help me to step aside and
[41:21] Grant all the prayer requests we have
[41:22] prayed already heal the sick and help
[41:25] everyone who needs something Lord may we
[41:28] be blessed Lord even more than we can
[41:30] pray we pray that in the name of our
[41:32] Lord Jesus amen you may be
[41:37] seated okay brother on he really I don't
[41:40] know if this is maybe some making some
[41:42] problem no it's okay
[41:47] okay okay uh brother one he said we we
[41:51] we speak very good English but uh I I
[41:54] I'm not sure if I can really justify his
[41:56] words
[41:57] you will see after one hour but I have a
[42:00] secret weapon I speak German so maybe I
[42:04] will seek some words and ask him uh to
[42:07] help
[42:09] me also don't feel bad uh if I deal with
[42:13] you as a teacher in a class because um I
[42:17] mainly work uh also as a teacher in a
[42:19] high school and you know how teacher are
[42:22] they don't know anything they asked the
[42:25] the pupils the students you know
[42:28] they pretend to know everything and ask
[42:30] the
[42:31] students so maybe I will ask some
[42:34] questions but uh it's like uh when I was
[42:38] uh making my study I'm actually a
[42:41] mechanical engineer but I choose to work
[42:43] as a teacher uh because I want to be
[42:47] more with the people in the church and
[42:48] the word of God and the job of a
[42:51] mechanical engineer would take me too
[42:53] much of course it would I would have
[42:55] some benefits uh but not spiritually you
[42:58] know so that's uh the main thing and uh
[43:02] when I was making my degree uh my mentor
[43:07] Professor told me uh I should just like
[43:11] um defend you know all the work I have
[43:15] done I said Don't You Worry uh when you
[43:17] go outside uh we professors we we we are
[43:21] just uh the same as everyone else uh we
[43:24] go outside he said there wasn't uh one
[43:26] examp example one Professor he went
[43:28] outside and was uh making his uh uh
[43:33] class uh you know uh uh explaining
[43:36] everything and he was writing a lot you
[43:39] know on some board and he asked uh is
[43:43] everything clear and there was one
[43:46] student he stood up and he said no if
[43:49] you can explain again so the professor
[43:51] was retelling this story to his uh
[43:54] colleagues professors he said I hav it
[43:56] again to the board I write everything
[43:59] you know again and the whole board and
[44:01] two boards even and I asked again is
[44:04] everything uh CLA and he can you imagine
[44:09] this student stood again up and he said
[44:13] no so you imagine the third time I was
[44:17] writing everything on the board
[44:20] and I started to understand and he still
[44:26] not
[44:28] so it's just like that you understand
[44:31] sometimes we're preaching things we
[44:34] think we know but when we start
[44:36] preaching it then it
[44:39] unfolds so that's experience of a
[44:41] Preacher I don't I don't know if you can
[44:43] relate with it but you know sometimes
[44:45] you prepare some things and you want to
[44:48] share and you think oh that's really
[44:50] good but when sometimes you speak
[44:53] something out you just wow what did I
[44:55] say you know so it's really something
[44:58] special to be just in the service for
[45:02] God and I believe you hear your pastor
[45:04] many times speaking some wonderful
[45:06] things so I want to go somehow through a
[45:10] small Bible study maybe for one hour so
[45:13] just uh if you can bear with me and help
[45:15] me a little bit maybe there will be a
[45:17] few scriptures because as a teacher we
[45:20] have a saying like um a peasant can go
[45:24] out of his village but his village will
[45:26] never go out of him you know so I'm
[45:28] wherever I go I just try to teach or to
[45:31] say something but I will take a lot of
[45:33] quotes bible verses and because uh my
[45:37] queen's English is not so good I will
[45:39] try to use The King's English King
[45:43] James and the message and I hope when I
[45:47] read these things it will not be too
[45:49] hard for you to bear with me okay so the
[45:52] main thought was actually uh going from
[45:56] uh leaves to White
[45:58] rayment so we have read this opening
[46:01] scripture like uh uh Adam and Eve they
[46:05] realized they were naked and now they
[46:08] they started to make uh fig leaves as we
[46:11] have read in the seventh verse and uh
[46:15] made themselves aprons and uh they
[46:17] started to uh clothe themselves and uh
[46:23] if you would go further on uh in the
[46:26] third chapter the 21st verse says that
[46:30] unto Adam also and to his wife did the
[46:32] Lord God made quats of skins and clothed
[46:35] them now we see the garments are changed
[46:38] and the FES are throwing away and God
[46:42] gave them a gave them coats of skins and
[46:45] clothed them with that and uh not only
[46:49] that there were car carabins and a
[46:51] flaming swad which turned every way to
[46:54] keep them away from the Tree of Life so
[46:57] we understand it was something which God
[47:00] wanted to do and to show us but uh uh
[47:05] one of the things you can take out of it
[47:07] for example we we have only two kinds of
[47:11] religions so one is uh you know about
[47:14] God so you try to do something for
[47:17] God you try to do something for God and
[47:21] the other one which is the true
[47:23] Christianity not just Christianity but
[47:26] true Christianity
[47:27] is God is doing something for you so
[47:30] that's just two ways nothing else every
[47:33] religion whatever this you know uh you
[47:36] can divide into these two even
[47:39] Christians many times they are just like
[47:41] uh somehow they they're missing the idea
[47:46] they're trying to do something for God
[47:48] and they're falling into a trap you know
[47:51] and then they cannot have the real
[47:54] fellowship and relationship with God so
[47:57] if you go further on and you come to
[48:00] Revelation then uh we see what should be
[48:03] the end of our clothing and the changing
[48:06] of our garments and you can see that God
[48:08] was uh uh saying to the messenger of the
[48:12] Lan Church age in the third chapter that
[48:16] uh I counil the in the 18th verse uh uh
[48:20] to buy of me go try it in fire that all
[48:23] might be rich and white rment that may
[48:27] be clo so we see it goes from thick
[48:29] leaves to White rayment that's our pth
[48:34] and uh we need to understand the
[48:36] changing of the garments that is the key
[48:39] how you can change you know how Adam
[48:43] change from fig leaves to the coat skins
[48:46] and then if you go further on at the end
[48:49] the right the right Ryman should Raymond
[48:52] should come again under the same uh
[48:55] inspiration with the same same key of
[48:58] changing and that must be by God but how
[49:01] it comes I want just to show you through
[49:03] the Bible and through the message if I
[49:06] can in this short time and you can maybe
[49:09] find some other quotes or just uh uh
[49:12] study a little bit when you're at home
[49:15] but uh one main question is actually why
[49:19] are so many people today uh so far from
[49:22] God you know even they uh confess or
[49:25] they they going to some church or
[49:28] wherever they are but many people are
[49:31] very far from God because of one reason
[49:34] brother explained he said in the message
[49:38] conference he said before he could talk
[49:40] to Adam he could not talk to him
[49:45] naked so that's uh something we should
[49:48] just uh notice that God cannot couldn't
[49:51] speak to Adam while he was naked so now
[49:55] you understand for sure was spiritually
[49:57] minded that his uh uh nakedness in body
[50:01] now we apply to spiritual nakedness so
[50:05] God cannot talk to people while they're
[50:07] naked they need to be clothed you know
[50:10] many people they try to come to God and
[50:12] speak with him but he cannot speak to
[50:14] them because there's something missing
[50:17] and uh brother explained of course God
[50:21] killed something something has to die
[50:22] something did die to make a covering
[50:26] that we could hold this conference with
[50:28] God of course he explained further on in
[50:30] the bridge message I think somewhere
[50:33] that many people they claiming the blood
[50:36] but they're not coming under the blood
[50:37] because rejecting the plan how to come
[50:41] so it's okay God killed something and uh
[50:44] prepared everything but if you're not
[50:46] accepting the plan you're actually
[50:48] staying
[50:49] naked and that's a very very big problem
[50:52] for the people and because of that they
[50:54] cannot hear God any anymore to speak so
[50:58] you see a lot of things changed from the
[51:01] beginning because Paul says that uh many
[51:05] have a seared conscious I'm saying yeah
[51:09] okay so uh what happened from the
[51:11] beginning you see in the beginning Adam
[51:14] was afraid when he hear the voice of
[51:17] God okay today people can hear that God
[51:21] is speaking but they don't afraid
[51:23] anymore you know they just something
[51:25] happened to them sure like brother was
[51:27] explaining when this great earthquake
[51:30] was you know and everything was shaking
[51:32] he was there also with his wife
[51:34] somewhere and then some man came out and
[51:37] said did you see what I have done I a
[51:40] Superman or something like that so
[51:42] people have no no sensivity anymore for
[51:45] the voice of God but uh if you look on
[51:49] Cain even that was something very uh
[51:52] strange for me if you read in Genesis 4
[51:55] it's written that
[51:57] Cain and in the fifth verse Genesis 4:5
[52:01] but unto Cain and to his offering he had
[52:03] not respect and Cain was very rot and
[52:07] his countenance fell so can you
[52:10] understand that Cain even he could
[52:13] understand that his that his offering
[52:16] was not uh accepted today people they
[52:19] don't even realize that the offering is
[52:21] not accepted they're offering prayers
[52:23] and doing many many things so from from
[52:26] the beginning many things changed
[52:29] because of this big change you know we
[52:31] it needed a time that we come again back
[52:35] to this fellowship and relationship with
[52:38] God and God had a plan how to come back
[52:41] to it so uh but B was saying something
[52:45] very interesting for me when I was
[52:48] reading about uh Babylon and Nimrod how
[52:52] he was making a tower uh and you read in
[52:54] the Bible it's a little bit strange
[52:57] there that uh God had to come down and
[53:01] to stop them in their doing because it
[53:04] looked like they will succeed to make a
[53:08] tower and you know when you think about
[53:11] it how could take succeed to make a
[53:14] tower to go into heaven you
[53:16] know they would not succeed like that
[53:19] but that what would happen if God would
[53:22] not come down it would make a wrong
[53:25] impression and a pattern for people in
[53:28] the future because brother Abraham said
[53:31] that what Nim was trying to achieve was
[53:35] that man could run up in heaven if it
[53:39] got bad here on Earth and live in heaven
[53:42] and then come back down on Earth and sin
[53:44] and go back into heaven again in and he
[53:47] said that's been the idea of man all
[53:50] along the road trying to sin and live in
[53:54] Earth and be in heaven at the same time
[53:58] so what are people trying to do in
[54:01] nakedness trying to make themself away
[54:05] that they have the feeling like they are
[54:08] in heaven everything is fine but still
[54:10] living in sin and God had to come down
[54:14] to show it will not be possible he will
[54:16] he will prevent I don't know in what
[54:19] which message it was I'm have noted here
[54:22] but I think mentioned once uh one
[54:25] Pentecostal some other preacher who was
[54:29] uh playing like maybe guitar or singing
[54:32] in some nightclub Saturday and then
[54:35] Sunday is coming and preaching and
[54:37] finally he killed himself he blowed his
[54:40] head with a gun and brother said no
[54:43] wonder he did this you cannot live a
[54:46] double life you know it's too much
[54:49] pressure on you you cannot live a double
[54:51] but people they are still trying to do
[54:53] it you know and uh we are sincere
[54:56] followers of the message we really
[54:59] really not interested in something like
[55:01] that but now we understand why it is
[55:03] important to follow the pattern of God
[55:05] you know not to try your own thing
[55:08] because you will never succeed so
[55:10] brother explained it in one very good
[55:13] quote in the message wisdom versus Faith
[55:16] he said and I hope I will not nobody
[55:19] will get offended because I I saw so
[55:22] many n nice palm trees and everything
[55:24] it's really beautiful here you know know
[55:27] but brother man said the same against
[55:29] Florida he said got nothing against
[55:32] Florida he said I don't mean this for
[55:35] you people from Florida but when I
[55:38] crossed and went in Florida the first
[55:40] time and come back to Georgia Line I
[55:42] stood right there and said as an
[55:44] American citizen I give my part of feed
[55:46] back to the seals where it belongs why
[55:50] they take better care of their yards
[55:53] than I do my hair
[55:56] so he said everything feather edged the
[55:59] palm trees has got lights all over it
[56:02] big Swanky Ys and things and now he's
[56:05] the key trying to bring a millennium
[56:09] without
[56:10] repentance that's what people are trying
[56:12] to do they just try to go in Heavenly
[56:15] places without repentance and then
[56:18] sinning and then when they sinning they
[56:21] feel something's wrong again into
[56:23] experience with God maybe in some church
[56:25] you know has singing some songs and
[56:27] living like that and if God wouldn't
[56:30] come down it would be like it's
[56:31] scriptural we can do it you know but God
[56:34] he marked it you know he destroyed that
[56:37] and he said it's not possible so there
[56:39] is a plan for us God has a plan to
[56:43] clothe us properly and to bring us in
[56:46] such a stage that we can really have
[56:49] that experience which was in the
[56:52] beginning amen
[56:54] so uh
[57:00] brother said that in the message of
[57:03] Grace he is explaining how terrible it
[57:06] was that morning when darkness was
[57:08] hanging in the garden and he said there
[57:11] came Jehovah Jehovah down like a roar of
[57:15] Thunder walking through the garden
[57:17] crying Adam Where Art
[57:20] Thou that's when Adam realized he was
[57:23] naked and had sin before God
[57:27] so uh brother man said okay let's read
[57:30] that quote uh underlined joining church
[57:33] will never cover sin no dry confession
[57:36] will ever cover sin it takes sorrow and
[57:39] repentance and the grace of God to cover
[57:42] sin for the blood of Jesus Christ the
[57:44] one that God killed at Calvary to cover
[57:46] sin so when you think about uh you know
[57:52] when God is speaking uh and sometimes
[57:55] he's asking questions
[57:57] Adam where are th so what do you think
[58:00] did God know where Adam is or not of
[58:03] course he's not asking because he
[58:06] doesn't know he's asking because he
[58:08] wants Adam to wake up hey what are you
[58:11] doing man something's wrong but brother
[58:16] explained that when ad when God was
[58:18] speaking to Adam that's when Adam
[58:22] realized he was naked so you see what's
[58:25] the real realization of nakedness it's
[58:28] the voice of God the voice of God will
[58:31] only open the people's eyes so because
[58:34] of that God had to send a message
[58:37] because people they when they were naked
[58:39] God could not speak to them so he had to
[58:41] send a voice first for them to realize
[58:44] that they are naked they could repent so
[58:47] when somebody does not receive the voice
[58:50] for this age what will happen with him
[58:52] he will stay naked and God cannot speak
[58:55] to him yes so you know it's difficult it
[59:01] was a very I would say uh a bitter
[59:04] experience for me I was uh I have no
[59:07] time now to expl to tell all my uh
[59:11] testimony how I converted but I was
[59:13] first two years in the Pentecostal
[59:14] church and it was a one Pentecostal
[59:17] Church baptizing in the name of the Lord
[59:19] Jesus Christ and U of course believing
[59:23] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but as
[59:25] p costal you know they believe that when
[59:28] you speak in tongues you are baptized
[59:30] with the Holy
[59:31] Ghost so when I hear there is a holy
[59:35] ghost I really wanted to have the Holy
[59:37] Ghost and uh uh of course there the
[59:42] doctrine is you need to speak in
[59:44] tongues and uh believe me I would do
[59:48] anything what the what the preacher says
[59:50] if say speak in tongues or stay on your
[59:52] head to receive the Holy Ghost I would
[59:54] do it because I wanted to have the hly
[59:56] Holy Ghost and then watching people they
[59:58] are getting baptized and the preacher
[59:59] says I baptize you in the name of the
[1:00:01] Lord Jesus Christ and God will give you
[1:00:04] the Holy Ghost you know and then some
[1:00:06] other were baptized you know and the
[1:00:09] preacher says I baptize you in the name
[1:00:11] of the Holy uh the name of the Lord
[1:00:13] Jesus Christ and the Lord God has
[1:00:15] already given you the Holy Ghost I think
[1:00:18] oh my that's special you know so I hear
[1:00:23] that actually yeah some people are
[1:00:25] receiving the Holy Ghost G before and
[1:00:27] because they have spoken in tongues so I
[1:00:30] said Lord I want to have the Holy Ghost
[1:00:33] and I prayed and maybe just to maybe
[1:00:36] touch a bit this testimony I was making
[1:00:38] my study uh in University preparing for
[1:00:41] my exam it was
[1:00:44] maybe like 2 3:00 in the morning if
[1:00:47] you're a student or real student you
[1:00:49] know they like to learn at night it's
[1:00:52] quiet you know nobody disturbs you and I
[1:00:55] I was really happy you know I prepared I
[1:00:58] was just glad that everything I covered
[1:01:01] you know I will be ready next day so I
[1:01:04] thought okay I will I will just thank
[1:01:07] the Lord you know so some voice was
[1:01:09] telling me come on the Lord knows that
[1:01:11] you're thankful just get in bed you know
[1:01:13] you need to sleep so I said no I will
[1:01:15] thank the Lord you know so I I was
[1:01:18] kneeling down it was a small small room
[1:01:20] where I was and I started to say Thank
[1:01:23] you Lord Jesus that you're helping me
[1:01:25] you know and I was praying and uh
[1:01:28] suddenly I he some strange noise you
[1:01:31] know and it was at my window that I
[1:01:34] thought somebody is and he's knocking
[1:01:36] you know I thought my what's going on it
[1:01:39] seems I'm praying too loud and
[1:01:40] somebody's coming and he's you know U
[1:01:44] not happy because of that so I stopped
[1:01:47] but then no noise was here so I I
[1:01:51] thought strange okay I started to pray
[1:01:54] again but again strange
[1:01:56] noise and words you know and then I
[1:02:01] realized that's me speaking you know I
[1:02:04] was speaking another tongue another
[1:02:07] language and suddenly I felt so happy I
[1:02:10] was glad you know I get the gift
[1:02:14] speaking in tongues and I still have it
[1:02:16] of course it's it's really a gift from
[1:02:18] God and I can speak in tongues and I'm
[1:02:20] glad for that but at that time I was
[1:02:23] thought it's it's the baptism of the
[1:02:25] Holy ghost and I have the sign that I'm
[1:02:28] ready to be and to uh to meet the Lord
[1:02:31] Jesus so I was happy of course and I
[1:02:34] believe it's really a gift of God but
[1:02:36] the doctrine was
[1:02:38] wrong and I don't know as far as I
[1:02:41] remember that time I think I was still
[1:02:44] wearing shorts sometimes you know and so
[1:02:47] going around have any bad feeling but
[1:02:51] once the Pentecostal Church where I was
[1:02:53] attending and nearby was quite the big
[1:02:56] church about 400 people you know I like
[1:02:59] to go there because a lot of young
[1:03:01] people were there and I had a strange
[1:03:04] dream I had a dream that I'm going to
[1:03:06] that Pentecostal
[1:03:07] church and uh as I'm going there
[1:03:11] entering there was like a balcony where
[1:03:13] the young people were and I was going up
[1:03:15] there and all the young people some 50
[1:03:18] 60 young people looking at me and
[1:03:20] pointing
[1:03:22] in I thought what they are laughing you
[1:03:25] know what's wrong
[1:03:27] and was looking at
[1:03:28] me I'm in my
[1:03:32] underwear how I'm coming to church in my
[1:03:35] underwear what what happened to
[1:03:38] me oh I was so ashamed I didn't want to
[1:03:40] run away because they would laugh even
[1:03:42] more there was some guy you know he said
[1:03:45] why you laughing everybody can come how
[1:03:47] he wants you know God will accept
[1:03:50] everyone so I said okay I will sit there
[1:03:53] but I didn't feel comfortable you know
[1:03:57] you know in your
[1:03:59] underwear so I knew something's wrong
[1:04:02] you know with my experience or my
[1:04:06] Doctrine when I woke up I I knew
[1:04:08] immediately something's not right you
[1:04:09] know I didn't know the message but I
[1:04:12] know nakedness is not a good sign you
[1:04:15] know for sure the Bible teaches us like
[1:04:19] that so I I'm reading in the Bible that
[1:04:23] we should cover our nakedness and uh the
[1:04:25] that's a spiritual application so
[1:04:28] nakedness means unbelief you know if you
[1:04:29] have a dream that you're not covered
[1:04:31] properly maybe just think maybe some
[1:04:34] unbelief or something is bothering you
[1:04:35] and God wants to help you but you know
[1:04:38] at that time I was really troubled and I
[1:04:41] didn't know what to do you
[1:04:43] know but uh maybe I don't know how long
[1:04:46] after that the message came into my life
[1:04:48] it's a long story now to tell but uh
[1:04:52] when I was reading all the things
[1:04:54] brother theah was preing in and
[1:04:56] listening to it I understood my Doctrine
[1:05:00] is wrong I'm not I'm not not clothed
[1:05:03] properly I'm not taught right I need to
[1:05:06] receive the message for this
[1:05:09] age so I was glad that the message came
[1:05:12] but you know it was not easy for me uh I
[1:05:16] felt so good that I speaking in tongues
[1:05:18] I was not even yet baptized you know and
[1:05:20] now somebody's coming and he's just
[1:05:22] throwing everything to the Earth you
[1:05:25] know
[1:05:26] it was a disappointment but this message
[1:05:29] you know we try to make it nice for
[1:05:32] people but we we we we must not forget
[1:05:36] this message comes for one purpose yes
[1:05:39] sir that people die to
[1:05:41] theel you can it you can make it nice
[1:05:44] however you want but at the end
[1:05:46] Everybody Must
[1:05:50] Die so uh you must die to yourself to
[1:05:53] your own understanding to your own
[1:05:55] doctrines to everything to your
[1:05:57] imagination Everything Must Die it must
[1:06:00] be a full capitulation you know full
[1:06:03] surrender I said like in the second
[1:06:05] world war you know the Germans they lost
[1:06:08] so some of them they thought maybe okay
[1:06:11] we lost now you Americans and Russians
[1:06:13] go home we we stay here and uh we lost
[1:06:17] but it was not like that the the
[1:06:19] Americans stood the German the the
[1:06:22] Russians stood you know the French the
[1:06:24] English men the Germans were not happy
[1:06:27] why because now they have not only this
[1:06:30] man here but they have first they had to
[1:06:34] clean the mess the themselves you know
[1:06:37] the Americans and Russian will not clean
[1:06:39] what was left from the bombing so they
[1:06:41] were not happy to have a lot of mess
[1:06:43] cleaning and that's what's happening
[1:06:45] with us when God comes in our life
[1:06:48] there's a lot of mess we have to clean
[1:06:51] and we we are not happy with it but it
[1:06:53] has to be done and somebody supervising
[1:06:57] you you know he's ah no no there's some
[1:06:59] left you know go there you know you can
[1:07:02] say no that's my country no you have
[1:07:04] lost the V you you need to clean this
[1:07:07] mess and you could see on many
[1:07:09] documentaries if you watch you know the
[1:07:12] German women they were not happy the
[1:07:14] Americans ah they are making a video you
[1:07:16] know and now we have to clean this why
[1:07:18] they are not cleaning they have bummed
[1:07:20] our country and so forth but that's you
[1:07:22] know the rules and not only that then
[1:07:25] the teacher in the school he could not
[1:07:27] teach anymore Germany is the biggest
[1:07:29] Nation or something they they had to
[1:07:31] change the teaching everything but they
[1:07:33] were teaching in school uh everything
[1:07:36] was different the judges were not uh
[1:07:38] anymore the same you know they could not
[1:07:41] judge someone because he was saying bad
[1:07:43] things about Adolf Hitler or someone
[1:07:45] else other judges coming in you know and
[1:07:48] they were judging different so this
[1:07:50] message comes in our life to change
[1:07:53] everything if it's a full surrender if
[1:07:56] it's not a full surrender
[1:07:58] right we are just missing a lot of
[1:08:02] things in our life and we cannot expect
[1:08:04] that at the end we will be clothed in
[1:08:06] white reignment okay so brother man says
[1:08:11] people stay people say in the message uh
[1:08:15] thirsting for
[1:08:16] life they say people say I can stay at
[1:08:19] home and be just as good a Christian as
[1:08:22] I can at
[1:08:23] church but man says you can't you cannot
[1:08:28] yeah so that's a voice like a judge you
[1:08:30] know if you make a full surrender and
[1:08:34] you say I I'm doing this you know I can
[1:08:36] do what I want and the voice of the
[1:08:39] judge says that's not what I'm speaking
[1:08:41] that's the voice of God to this last
[1:08:45] age who has an ear and can hear Let Him
[1:08:48] hear what the spirit is speaking so the
[1:08:50] spirit says you
[1:08:53] cannot it's simple somebody they are
[1:08:56] saying no I can I I I I can feed myself
[1:09:00] I can do that and that but uh you know
[1:09:03] if you read the Bible if you read
[1:09:05] brother Braham is quoting the Bible
[1:09:07] verse where it's said not for said not
[1:09:10] for sake our our assemble ourselves
[1:09:13] together and so forth you know Hebrews
[1:09:16] 11 yeah or
[1:09:17] 12 and he said if you a Christian you
[1:09:21] long to go where other Christians are
[1:09:23] and fellowship with other Christians so
[1:09:25] you cannot stay away from church and
[1:09:27] live the same life you cannot do
[1:09:29] it that's the truth you know that's the
[1:09:32] truth so
[1:09:35] uh okay I will skip some of that because
[1:09:39] I I think we will not make everything in
[1:09:41] time but there's a lot of things uh
[1:09:44] which comes with this thing uh verses
[1:09:48] quotes So first uh if you look
[1:09:52] back uh God's voice was making
[1:09:56] Adam uh his senses open for his uh stage
[1:10:02] and uh his uh image how he's looking
[1:10:05] like you know so the voice of God you
[1:10:08] cannot skip the voice of God and God is
[1:10:11] putting his voice voice in uh uh a
[1:10:15] fivefold Ministry if you listen and read
[1:10:19] Ephesians you can see that the fful
[1:10:21] ministry is actually put to uh bring in
[1:10:25] the mature
[1:10:27] stage okay so to to Really I cannot
[1:10:31] quote now in English but you know what
[1:10:33] you can find that Bible verse okay and
[1:10:37] if we don't take that if we take our own
[1:10:40] righteousness uh Isaiah says it's all as
[1:10:43] filthy rxs okay so our own understanding
[1:10:48] what is really good for us is as filthy
[1:10:51] rexs so now let's see what actually is
[1:10:56] bringing this
[1:10:58] nakedness the spiritual nakedness there
[1:11:01] is a very good example in Exodus
[1:11:04] 32 and uh I would like to go into this
[1:11:07] just to read a few verses Exodus 32 from
[1:11:11] the 21st
[1:11:13] verse and it was when Moses was on on
[1:11:16] the mountain and he came back and he saw
[1:11:18] the people of Israel what was happening
[1:11:20] with them and he came not to the people
[1:11:22] but to Aaron and he said
[1:11:26] what did these
[1:11:27] people unto thee that thou has brought
[1:11:30] so great a sin upon them so think about
[1:11:34] that he is blaming Aaron that he has
[1:11:37] brought sin upon
[1:11:39] them so Aaron he could say no I'm not
[1:11:42] guilty I know they are such and such
[1:11:44] people are stubborn and they will not
[1:11:46] listen so I was just uh serving them
[1:11:49] whatever they want but you
[1:11:51] know uh Moses was speaking uh about was
[1:11:55] actually really important to recognize
[1:11:58] who is responsible who is responsible
[1:12:01] and um okay let's go maybe through these
[1:12:04] verses and Aaron said let not the angel
[1:12:06] of my Lord re th knowest the people that
[1:12:08] thou are set on Mish so Aaron was
[1:12:11] blaming the people you know for they
[1:12:13] said unto me make with Gods which shall
[1:12:15] go before far from this Moses the man
[1:12:18] that brought us up out of the land of
[1:12:20] Egypt we want not what is become of him
[1:12:24] and I said unto them whosoever had any
[1:12:26] God let them break it off so gold let
[1:12:29] them break it off so they gave it me
[1:12:32] then I cast it into the fire and there
[1:12:34] came out this Cal so if so a cal can out
[1:12:37] can can can come out of fire it's really
[1:12:39] strange put some gold and a cal comes
[1:12:42] out it's a very very cheap you
[1:12:46] know explanation what happened here you
[1:12:50] know we break some gold put it in the
[1:12:52] fire and a cal come out
[1:12:55] but you know the 25th
[1:12:58] verse that's the key verse when Moses
[1:13:02] saw that the people were naked for Aaron
[1:13:06] had make made them naked unto their
[1:13:09] shame among the enemies now we are
[1:13:12] understanding where the nakedness of
[1:13:14] Israel came it be it was because of a
[1:13:18] weak
[1:13:19] leader a weak
[1:13:21] Ministry Leading the People and
[1:13:24] permitting sin in the Camp so if you
[1:13:27] take actually that word made
[1:13:30] naked uh it's the Hebrew word I think it
[1:13:34] will not be of many use I can say it's
[1:13:37] like par but if you take this word and
[1:13:41] have a look on it the meaning is to lead
[1:13:44] act as a leader to let go let loose
[1:13:47] ignore let alone to be let loose be
[1:13:50] loosen of restraint and you can
[1:13:53] understand that he didn't took uh the
[1:13:57] garments of them and made them naked but
[1:14:00] it was a spiritual
[1:14:02] nakedness and he was responsible because
[1:14:06] he was not standing as a leader in front
[1:14:08] of them his ministry was not good enough
[1:14:11] to lead them but the opposite they made
[1:14:16] naked this ministry of Aaron and Moses
[1:14:19] was angry on him you understand so there
[1:14:24] is a responsibility
[1:14:25] in every age uh and we have some more
[1:14:29] Bible verses maybe in 2 Chronicles if
[1:14:31] you read the 28th
[1:14:33] verse uh 28th chapter the 18th and 19th
[1:14:37] verse maybe maybe just the 19th uh it's
[1:14:40] written for the Lord brought Judah LW
[1:14:43] because of AAS king of Israel for he
[1:14:48] made Judah
[1:14:49] naked so you see the leader the King was
[1:14:53] responsible for the nakedness of Judah
[1:14:56] it's not the people it's okay they are
[1:14:58] responsible of course also but God is
[1:15:02] making the leader the king responsible
[1:15:06] for the nakedness of the people amen and
[1:15:09] and and you can understand uh why it is
[1:15:13] uh so important to have a true
[1:15:16] leadership a Ministry which will stand
[1:15:19] firm with the word of God and will not
[1:15:22] just under pressure of people make some
[1:15:26] things and then you know play the blame
[1:15:29] game you know that's not it so the same
[1:15:33] word for making uh naked you can find in
[1:15:37] Proverbs 29 where it's written where
[1:15:40] there is no vision Vision the people
[1:15:43] perish uh you can uh translate it like
[1:15:46] that where there is no vision the people
[1:15:49] are being naked they become naked that
[1:15:52] would be the application of that word
[1:15:54] you know but of course uh it's written
[1:15:58] like that you don't notice it maybe but
[1:16:00] it's the same Hebrew
[1:16:02] word and in Proverbs 8 it's written hear
[1:16:06] instruction Proverbs 8:33 hear
[1:16:09] instruction and bece and refuse it not
[1:16:13] refuse it not that means don't be naked
[1:16:17] so instruction hearing
[1:16:21] instruction makes you clo it refus
[1:16:25] instruction makes you
[1:16:27] naked so now we understand what is
[1:16:29] happening how God is clothing his people
[1:16:33] he's sending people giving them
[1:16:35] instruction to a minister and receiving
[1:16:39] that instruction cloth you and you will
[1:16:41] be found clothed refusing instruction
[1:16:45] makes you naked however people feel they
[1:16:48] they are clothed but in God's eyes
[1:16:51] they're
[1:16:52] naked so it's really very simple to
[1:16:56] follow that uh line in the Bible
[1:16:59] understand that God actually provided
[1:17:02] for his people but people because of
[1:17:05] their uh uh heart and the the the
[1:17:09] hardness of their heart they refuse
[1:17:11] instruction and they will like Paul said
[1:17:15] seek teachers like their ears tickling
[1:17:17] them or how you say okay so so that's
[1:17:21] what people are doing and uh sometimes
[1:17:25] you know you can pity the people in
[1:17:28] churches and say oh pity these people
[1:17:31] they you know but actually it's not pity
[1:17:33] the people it's God
[1:17:36] judgment they refused God so God send
[1:17:40] them a strong delusion you know just
[1:17:44] because they don't want to accept you
[1:17:46] cannot pity the people everybody will
[1:17:49] bear his own burden so you have a right
[1:17:52] to pray like the the message came to me
[1:17:55] I had to make full surrender everybody
[1:17:57] has to you know so you don't even know
[1:18:00] what that does this mean you know I
[1:18:03] didn't know what does this mean I knew I
[1:18:05] had to left the church the Pentecostal
[1:18:07] church and they told me why leing the
[1:18:10] church I don't know it's the voice of
[1:18:13] God calling me I cannot live anymore
[1:18:16] like that where will you go I don't know
[1:18:19] I I I told I don't know so we left the
[1:18:22] Pentecostal church at that time me my
[1:18:25] brother Adam brother R knows him and
[1:18:29] some other you know it was a difficult
[1:18:31] time we were gathering at some houses at
[1:18:34] my home some other places we are trying
[1:18:37] just to use whatever we had you know
[1:18:39] from the message we had just little
[1:18:42] booklets you know small amount of them
[1:18:44] and uh trying to understand what God
[1:18:47] wants from us but we had nothing only
[1:18:50] God and his
[1:18:52] voice but that was enough you know
[1:18:55] that was enough and God started to open
[1:18:58] our eyes and show us a lot of things and
[1:19:00] you
[1:19:01] know let's have a look uh just a little
[1:19:04] bit more in the Bible the Bible says in
[1:19:07] Revelation one that the sixth verse he
[1:19:10] made us Kings and
[1:19:12] Priests and uh we understand the
[1:19:15] priesthood everybody of we everybody are
[1:19:19] priests into in God's eyes and then in
[1:19:23] the 2 Chronicles 6 6
[1:19:25] 4041 maybe just 41 2 Chronicles
[1:19:29] 6:41 it's written now therefore rise oh
[1:19:32] Lord God into thy resting place thou and
[1:19:35] the Ark of thy strength let thy priests
[1:19:39] oh Lord God be clothed with salvation so
[1:19:43] it's it's a prayer we as a priesthood
[1:19:46] should be clothed into salvation so our
[1:19:48] clothing is even called
[1:19:52] salvation and uh in the
[1:19:56] 132nd Psalm the n9th verse let thy
[1:19:59] priests be cloth with
[1:20:02] righteousness so you see the clothing is
[1:20:05] coming to the ministry and in God's eyes
[1:20:08] receiving that
[1:20:09] Ministry is making you clo into
[1:20:12] salvation into righteousness you know
[1:20:15] all these
[1:20:17] things so actually we should be aware
[1:20:20] that we are clothed before the Rapture
[1:20:22] happens because Revelation 9
[1:20:25] says that we should be happy and merry
[1:20:28] because the Bride of the Lamb has
[1:20:31] prepared us and she is clothed into
[1:20:34] white Ling so we should be aware if we
[1:20:39] are clothed or if we are not you know
[1:20:41] you see the biggest difference if you
[1:20:44] look in in in in the scripture also at
[1:20:47] that big Feast when there was one guy
[1:20:51] who was actually one man who was not
[1:20:54] clothed properly that was the difference
[1:20:57] yeah he came in brother man said not
[1:20:59] through the door not through the world
[1:21:01] maybe through the window or something
[1:21:03] but his clothing was not properly so
[1:21:06] what's wrong he received wrong
[1:21:10] instructions refused true instruction he
[1:21:14] was somehow clothed but as a foolish
[1:21:16] virgin not properly the Holy Ghost was
[1:21:19] missing because the Holy Ghost comes
[1:21:22] with instruction which are from the word
[1:21:25] you cannot receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:21:27] refusing right instruction from the word
[1:21:30] of God whatever you believe you can be
[1:21:32] as happy as you want but if you re if
[1:21:36] you reject the word of God the Holy
[1:21:38] Ghost will never come and seal
[1:21:41] somebody and that was a bit experience
[1:21:43] for me but I said
[1:21:46] Lord thy Ro is true I'm ready to change
[1:21:50] I'm ready to accept everything you have
[1:21:52] you know so the foolish virgin is in
[1:21:54] trouble also you
[1:21:56] know
[1:21:57] so let's have a look in uh just a couple
[1:22:01] of quotes more brother man said in the
[1:22:03] present stage of my
[1:22:05] Ministry
[1:22:07] 121 he says well all man has forsaken me
[1:22:11] but there is one thing he stood by me I
[1:22:13] wasn't disobedient to the heavenly
[1:22:15] vision that happened down there on the
[1:22:17] river I've stayed true to him he has
[1:22:19] been true to me I'm trusting in Him
[1:22:21] someday I don't know when and now
[1:22:25] for for a crowning of my
[1:22:30] Ministry and then he says I don't know
[1:22:33] what it will be I don't know when it
[1:22:35] will be but he says I hope he will Crown
[1:22:38] my Ministry of this of letting me take
[1:22:42] the clothes of the
[1:22:44] word and dress his bride in the cloth of
[1:22:48] the world and for his
[1:22:50] righteousness amen so here we are
[1:22:52] everything is perfect amen the world his
[1:22:55] righteousness is our clothing it's our
[1:22:58] salvation and brother Braham as a
[1:23:01] crowning of his ministry that was he was
[1:23:04] preaching is doing it it's so
[1:23:08] beautiful sir so brother man said in the
[1:23:12] in the message God hiding himself in
[1:23:15] Simplicity he said now he's including
[1:23:18] not only him but there is a fivefold
[1:23:21] Ministry and you see in that uh uh
[1:23:24] message he said oh Lord God let it
[1:23:26] repeat again as we give ourselves to De
[1:23:29] with the with the church in dedication
[1:23:31] for service we commit ourselves with our
[1:23:34] offering of the church this morning to
[1:23:36] you for service for the Le day light for
[1:23:39] the evening time lights that we might
[1:23:42] bring he said we might bring consolation
[1:23:45] and Faith to the waiting people that's
[1:23:48] waiting for the coming of the bridegroom
[1:23:51] to dress a bride amen in the gospel of
[1:23:55] Christ for the Lord Jesus to receive so
[1:23:57] you see there must be a Ministry who is
[1:23:59] dressing the bride and because of that
[1:24:03] it is so important to have a real leader
[1:24:07] who will not make you naked but will
[1:24:09] clothe you with a true Ministry to the
[1:24:12] word of God to this message because we
[1:24:15] know the bride will be uh prepared to
[1:24:19] the messenger of the last age for the
[1:24:21] Rapture and through his preaching which
[1:24:24] the inspiration is coming on the
[1:24:26] fightful ministry because of that we
[1:24:28] cannot teach anything else just the same
[1:24:31] that is clothing the bright if we teach
[1:24:34] something else it will not cloth but if
[1:24:37] we teach the same it will make the
[1:24:40] clothing and you can be just happy and
[1:24:44] be assured God will receive me amen yeah
[1:24:49] there are so many quotes
[1:24:51] but I will skip a lot of them
[1:25:01] and sometimes some things are very
[1:25:04] simple maybe I will just take a couple
[1:25:06] of quotes in the New
[1:25:08] Testament first Peter
[1:25:11] 5 first Peter
[1:25:13] 5 five he says likewise ye younger
[1:25:17] submit yourselves unto the Elder yeah
[1:25:19] all of you be subject unto to another
[1:25:23] and be close cled with
[1:25:25] humility so you see the clothing
[1:25:27] includes humility sometimes people they
[1:25:30] taking a big Revelation and then they
[1:25:32] are just stamping on all the other
[1:25:35] because they are so small you know but
[1:25:38] humility goes with the world if you
[1:25:40] receive the real clothing it will make
[1:25:43] you humble because Peter identified
[1:25:46] identified humility with cloting so if
[1:25:50] somebody has big Revelation and he's
[1:25:51] making you small something's wrong
[1:25:54] because Peter is testifying the opposite
[1:25:57] okay
[1:25:58] so uh Ephesians
[1:26:01] 4
[1:26:03] uh maybe I will Skip and 24 Ephesians
[1:26:07] 4:24 he said and that he put on the new
[1:26:10] man so a new man is quoted okay which
[1:26:14] after God is created in righteousness
[1:26:17] and true Holiness and now he's
[1:26:19] explaining what does it mean to uh uh
[1:26:24] take take off old clothing and put on
[1:26:27] new clothing okay putting away lying
[1:26:31] speak every man truth with his neighbor
[1:26:33] for we are members one of another be
[1:26:36] angry and see not there must be a stop
[1:26:40] to the angriness okay let not the sun go
[1:26:42] down upon the rat neither give place to
[1:26:45] the devil let him that stole steal no
[1:26:48] more but rather let him labore walking
[1:26:50] with his hands the thing which is good
[1:26:52] that he may have to give to them that
[1:26:54] need it let no corrupt communication
[1:26:57] proceed of of your mouth but that which
[1:27:00] is good to do the use of edifying that
[1:27:02] it may Minister Grace unto the hearers G
[1:27:05] out the Holy Spirit whereby are sealed
[1:27:07] on the day of redemption let all
[1:27:09] bitterness and rra and anger and clamour
[1:27:12] and evil speaking be put away from you
[1:27:15] with all malice and be kind one to
[1:27:17] another tenderhearted forgiving one
[1:27:19] another even as God for Christ's sake
[1:27:21] had forgiven you so that's all
[1:27:25] take doing away the clothing wrong
[1:27:27] clothing and putting on the right
[1:27:29] clothing and every Ministry every true
[1:27:33] fivefold Ministry whatever he preaches
[1:27:36] it must be included the anointing of
[1:27:39] these verses must be in the minister to
[1:27:42] anoint his preaching if he's preaching
[1:27:45] something other we are the big group
[1:27:47] these are the small group we are the
[1:27:48] bride they are not the bride and so
[1:27:50] forth you know it's difficult to explain
[1:27:54] but just understand for example
[1:27:58] Abraham Abraham he was a type of a bride
[1:28:01] of the Bride he had lot his nephew which
[1:28:05] was a type of a foolish
[1:28:07] virgin but when lot was in trouble you
[1:28:10] know what Abraham has done he fight for
[1:28:14] him he helped him you know so you know
[1:28:18] how much more we should try to help each
[1:28:22] other if we are believing the same
[1:28:24] message fighting you know Abraham had I
[1:28:28] think
[1:28:29] 318 circumcised men fighting you know to
[1:28:32] to redeem Lord out of his trouble and
[1:28:35] that was the spirit of Christ the spirit
[1:28:38] of Christ will always try to sacrifice
[1:28:42] you know if you try to belittle some
[1:28:44] other who is not believing you know
[1:28:46] Abraham was never speaking wrong uh bad
[1:28:48] things about lot he couldn't convert him
[1:28:52] but he was trying to help him and I
[1:28:54] believe all these anointings which are
[1:28:57] in these verses must cover the preaching
[1:29:01] it must be part of the
[1:29:04] ministry he said if you be risen with uh
[1:29:06] Colossians 3 if you be risen with Christ
[1:29:09] seek those things which are
[1:29:11] about and uh said second verse so I said
[1:29:15] Colossians 3 second verse set your
[1:29:17] affection on things above not on things
[1:29:19] on the
[1:29:20] earth and
[1:29:22] uh okay okay the ninth verse that he
[1:29:26] have put off the old man with his deeds
[1:29:29] and now again now is the clothing and
[1:29:31] have put on the new man which is renewed
[1:29:33] in knowledge after the image of him that
[1:29:36] created him so it must be a renewing of
[1:29:39] the of of our spirit you know and uh we
[1:29:43] are not going to Romans uh 12 and so
[1:29:45] forth but he said in the 12th verse put
[1:29:47] on their force delect of God holy and
[1:29:50] beloved bubes of Mercy kindness
[1:29:52] humbleness of mind me weakness long
[1:29:54] suffering forbearing one another and
[1:29:57] forgiving one another If any man had a
[1:29:59] quel against any even as Christ forgave
[1:30:02] you so also do ye so that's all the
[1:30:06] clothing all the clothing of the new man
[1:30:08] you know and uh I believe that uh when
[1:30:13] somebody really sincere is seeking the
[1:30:16] counsel of God he cannot skip these
[1:30:19] small things written there people are
[1:30:22] searching for big revelation
[1:30:24] you know and to be clothed with some big
[1:30:26] thing but when you see the fruits of
[1:30:28] their life you can see many times
[1:30:31] something's missing there you know you
[1:30:33] know all these things we have read here
[1:30:37] so the True Church of Jesus Christ the
[1:30:40] bright is likened to pure gold so to be
[1:30:43] pure gold I believe all this must be
[1:30:46] part of our life her righteousness is in
[1:30:50] his righteousness her attributes are his
[1:30:52] own glorious attributes her identity is
[1:30:54] found in him what he is she is to
[1:30:57] reflect what he has she is to manifest
[1:31:00] there's no fault in her she's all
[1:31:02] glorious within and without from
[1:31:04] beginning to ending she's the work of
[1:31:06] the Lord and all his works are perfect
[1:31:09] in fact in her is sumed up and
[1:31:12] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:31:14] purpose of God so how can one fatom it
[1:31:17] how can one understand it so we cannot
[1:31:20] do that we can accept it by faith for
[1:31:22] God had spoken it
[1:31:24] worthy of the Gospel is this Lely Bri of
[1:31:28] Christ
[1:31:29] amen so I believe just this message uh
[1:31:34] wants to bring us back to the world
[1:31:35] because of that I read a lot of
[1:31:37] scriptures of the Bible it's just so
[1:31:39] simple that many people have forgotten
[1:31:41] that you know so I hope it could
[1:31:45] encourage you and to understand that a
[1:31:48] true ministry will cloth you uh avoiding
[1:31:52] a Ministry means you don't want to be
[1:31:55] clothed that's really dangerous you know
[1:31:58] and I believe you understand and you are
[1:32:00] enjoying you know when God has Anointed
[1:32:04] The Fold Ministry or all the Ministries
[1:32:06] you have here and we want to have a
[1:32:09] touch from every Ministry from time to
[1:32:12] time I like to invite an evangelist and
[1:32:14] teacher and Pastor uh just to have a
[1:32:16] touch from everyone to be cloth at every
[1:32:20] piece I don't know here in America but
[1:32:23] in our country a BRI is preparing
[1:32:25] herself for wedding she is not able to
[1:32:28] clothe herself she needs help I don't
[1:32:32] know how the brides are here clothing in
[1:32:34] America but the the the that garment
[1:32:37] she's putting on she's not able to fix
[1:32:40] every detail on herself she needs
[1:32:43] help so it's spiritual application we
[1:32:47] cannot clothe
[1:32:48] ourself we cannot teach
[1:32:51] ourself we need to have have the min
[1:32:53] Ministry which is helping us and a real
[1:32:57] uh Ministry of God will always stay
[1:32:59] humble and uh not trying to be big or
[1:33:02] bigger somebody else and that's our
[1:33:05] experience that's our desire for us for
[1:33:08] the bride in Serbia and I believe we can
[1:33:11] just really have the same understanding
[1:33:14] of these things I hope I could help you
[1:33:16] a little bit to see how we see this
[1:33:19] message and the word of God and how we
[1:33:21] enjoy it and um because it's a evening
[1:33:25] you know I don't want to show how big a
[1:33:28] preacher I am you know I just want to be
[1:33:31] a blessing for you and I'm really
[1:33:32] thankful for the time that you could
[1:33:34] bear with me uh maybe we could stand
[1:33:37] together and
[1:33:42] pray dear heavenly father we are so
[1:33:44] thankful Lord standing here humble and
[1:33:48] seeing that the word of God in the Bible
[1:33:51] and this message of this last Church age
[1:33:54] is going so together we can see it in
[1:33:57] the scripture we can see the Fulfillment
[1:33:59] we can understand how important it is to
[1:34:02] be in under good leadership under good
[1:34:05] Ministry which when it's ministered to
[1:34:08] the people is actually clothing to hold
[1:34:11] bright so we are clothed through the
[1:34:14] ministry of the word of God and we are
[1:34:16] so thankful Lord that you have send the
[1:34:18] fivefold ministry and helping us and
[1:34:20] that you want to prepare us to help us
[1:34:23] to make a full surrender in our life in
[1:34:26] every detail you ever want Lord and make
[1:34:29] this a revelation for us to think about
[1:34:31] and and just to receive correction from
[1:34:33] you Holy Ghost if you see anything in
[1:34:35] our lives to help us to change and just
[1:34:38] to be ready for the Rapture that day we
[1:34:41] pray that and I pray the
[1:34:42] blessing upon the church and the pastor
[1:34:45] and the ministry here in the name of our
[1:34:46] Lord Jesus
[1:34:48] amen

[1:35:04] language as well as he speaks our
[1:35:06] language and and and everything but I so

[1:35:15] still be a Christian he said no you

[1:35:43] me gold tried in the fire white rment
[1:35:47] that thou mayest be clothed huh and that
[1:35:50] the nakedness does not appear
[1:35:56] leadership helps clothe you in the
[1:35:59] word and obedience is being clothed
[1:36:05] upon any of you ever had a dream of
[1:36:08] going somewhere

[1:36:30] leadership was made responsible Aaron

[1:36:34] people
[1:36:35] naked Aaron you caused
[1:36:40] it what a
[1:36:45] responsibility you know on one of my
[1:36:47] favorite quotes as brother Bram said now

[1:36:54] he'll allow me to do this if he'll allow
[1:36:56] me or my Ministry to be
[1:37:01] crowned by taking the clothes of the
[1:37:04] word and dressing his
[1:37:08] bride and he said and the
[1:37:11] bride she needs little
