[50:38] sure wow how nice is this
[50:42] God bless you guys
[50:44] you know as you go to school
[50:47] you'll be partaking of the tree of
[50:49] knowledge of good and what
[50:52] of evil how many knows that there was
[50:55] another tree in the Garden of Eden at
[50:57] the same time what tree was that
[51:05] tree of life huh you knew it he knew it
[51:08] the tree of life and so we realize that
[51:12] as you're partaking of this tree of
[51:14] knowledge of good and of evil there's
[51:17] only one way to counterbalance this
[51:19] thing and that's to feed upon the tree
[51:21] of life and we know that the tree of
[51:23] life is who Jesus Christ
[51:26] and so the only way for you guys not to
[51:29] get balanced out of balance with school
[51:33] and influences and the things of the
[51:35] world is to partake of that tree of life
[51:38] which is Jesus Christ and that's what
[51:40] you're doing here this morning you're
[51:42] partaking of that tree reading your
[51:45] Bible praying and having a personal
[51:47] relationship with God is so important
[51:50] and so that's the kind of influence and
[51:53] let me encourage you guys
[51:55] it's so easy to be influenced by other
[51:59] people
[52:00] how about you be an influence to others
[52:03] around you and excuse me my back has
[52:06] turned to you all just as we're talking
[52:08] to the young people here you be an
[52:10] influence of Who You Are
[52:13] and of what God has done for you on
[52:15] other people so that they might see and
[52:18] get it you know what whatever you got I
[52:21] want it because you're different than
[52:23] everybody else and you guys are you're
[52:25] different and it's okay to be different
[52:29] so be encouraged choose your friends
[52:33] wisely
[52:35] the friends that you make in school try
[52:38] to make good friends people who are just
[52:41] like you in certain ways maybe they
[52:44] might not believe exactly how you
[52:46] believe but make sure and choose your
[52:48] friends wisely amen amen can you all
[52:51] agree that as we we're going to pray for
[52:54] the teachers here as well would you all

[52:58] feet and say Lord

[53:05] them into your hands Lord that God would
[53:08] keep them that he would use them that

[55:26] they're streaming so we welcome them in
[55:28] the name of the Lord
[55:29] amen let's Stand Together turn with me
[55:32] in your Bibles to Proverbs chapter 8.
[55:36] we'll read verse 13 then we'll go to
[55:38] proverbs 13.
[55:41] verse 10. thank you musicians
[55:48] Proverbs chapter 8.
[55:56] and verse 13 it says the fear of the
[55:59] Lord is to hate evil
[56:02] pride and arrogancy and the evil way
[56:06] and the frow word mouth do I hate
[56:12] my Proverbs chapter 13.
[56:17] in verse 10
[56:23] and it says only by Pride cometh
[56:26] contention
[56:28] so if there's contentions amongst us in
[56:31] our friendships and our families within
[56:33] our assembly what is the root cause of
[56:35] this contention
[56:37] Pride
[56:39] but with the whale advised is wisdom
[56:43] amen turn with me to Luke chapter 22.
[56:51] and we'll read verses 24
[56:54] through 34.
[57:04] Luke chapter 22.
[57:12] and verse 20.
[57:14] 24 and it says and there was also a
[57:18] Strife among them which of them should
[57:21] be accounted the greatest
[57:23] do you think there was pride in the life
[57:26] of the Apostles sure there was because
[57:29] there was contention and he said unto
[57:31] them the kings of the Gentiles exercise
[57:33] lordship over them and they that
[57:36] exercise Authority upon them are called
[57:39] benefactors but ye shall not be so
[57:43] but he that is greatest among you let
[57:45] him be as the younger and he that is
[57:48] Chief as he that doth serve for whether
[57:52] is greater
[57:53] he that sitteth that meat or he that
[57:56] serveth is not he that sitteth at me but
[57:59] I am among you as he that service now
[58:02] he's trying to teach the disciples here
[58:04] he's saying yeah who is who is greater
[58:06] in the natural sure it's the one that's
[58:09] being served but I am serving you and we
[58:12] know that Jesus was our example so as he
[58:15] served us we are supposed to serve one
[58:18] another
[58:19] ye or they which have continued with me
[58:22] and my Temptations and I appoint unto
[58:24] you a kingdom as my father hath
[58:26] appointed unto me that ye may eat and
[58:29] drink at my table in my kingdom and sit
[58:32] on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of
[58:34] Israel and the Lord said
[58:37] uh Simon Simon
[58:40] behold Satan hath desired to have you
[58:43] that he may sift you as wheat
[58:47] I wonder was Simon one of the main ones
[58:51] that was being contentious
[58:53] I wonder what Simon the real one that
[58:55] the one of the ones that wanted to know
[58:57] uh is it me Lord am I the one that's
[59:01] going to be the greatest am I the one
[59:02] Lord because I've Stood Beside You All
[59:04] This Time
[59:05] because he turned and he he very it
[59:08] seems like he randomly said this to
[59:10] Simon
[59:12] he says Satan has desired to have you
[59:15] that he may sift you as wheat but I have
[59:19] prayed for thee that thy faith fell not
[59:22] and when thou art converted strengthen
[59:25] thy Brethren and he said unto him Lord I
[59:28] am ready to go with thee both into
[59:31] prison and to death
[59:34] and he said I tell thee Peter the
[59:38] shall not Crow this day before that thou
[59:41] shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me
[59:45] my may the Lord add the blessing to the
[59:48] reading of his word this morning you may
[59:50] be seated
[59:55] I would like to title my sermon this
[59:58] morning God's School of humility and
[1:00:01] this is part three and I would like to
[1:00:03] take for this subject of
[1:00:07] our prideful Humanity
[1:00:11] our prideful Humanity
[1:00:14] brother Branham said in the sermon Pride
[1:00:17] 19 and 55 he said oh Pride such a cursed
[1:00:23] thing
[1:00:25] it's so awful
[1:00:27] so evil
[1:00:29] is pride
[1:00:31] he said it's a cursed thing it's so evil
[1:00:35] pride is one of those things like we
[1:00:38] read in our opening scripture that it's
[1:00:41] one of the things that God hates
[1:00:44] is pride
[1:00:46] now some of us are here this morning and
[1:00:50] within our pride we are saying what is
[1:00:53] he talking about I don't have any Pride
[1:00:59] because we all have this
[1:01:01] this this
[1:01:03] imaginary uh thing of what a prideful
[1:01:07] person is of what a prideful person
[1:01:11] looks like of what of how a prideful
[1:01:14] person acts
[1:01:16] but I just want to burst your bubble
[1:01:18] this morning that every one of us that
[1:01:21] are here this morning gathered in this
[1:01:23] building every one of us have a certain
[1:01:26] amount of pride in our lives
[1:01:29] whether you like to think it or not and
[1:01:32] it's a part of our life that God hates
[1:01:35] it's a part of our life that is evil it
[1:01:37] is a part of our life that is ugly it is
[1:01:40] a part of our life that is so awful and
[1:01:43] a cursed thing
[1:01:50] we get in our minds of a prideful person
[1:01:53] as a person of arrogancy
[1:01:56] a person who is boastful a person who is
[1:01:58] always showing off a person who is
[1:02:01] always in your face they're they're just
[1:02:03] they're just prideful they're so
[1:02:05] prideful of who they are and where they
[1:02:07] come from they're prideful of their
[1:02:09] family and they just walk in and you can
[1:02:11] see it written all over them
[1:02:14] let me tell you Pride hides itself
[1:02:17] and disguises itself sometimes in
[1:02:21] humility
[1:02:27] we're going to get into this and it's
[1:02:29] going to be so good
[1:02:31] and you're going to realize that you
[1:02:32] have pride in your life that God needs
[1:02:35] to take care of
[1:02:38] we all deal with pride in one way or
[1:02:41] another whether we think it or not
[1:02:44] it doesn't matter if you are quiet
[1:02:46] natured or it doesn't matter if you are
[1:02:50] full of confidence boastful and arrogant
[1:02:54] it doesn't matter if you're poor and it
[1:02:57] doesn't matter if you're wealthy and
[1:02:59] have plenty of money to spare pride is
[1:03:02] hidden within every one of our lives
[1:03:06] pride is one of those things that has
[1:03:09] embedded within our DNA it is embedded
[1:03:13] within the genes of humanity and it's
[1:03:16] one of those things that God hates but
[1:03:19] it's a part of us
[1:03:22] now the question is why is it a part of
[1:03:25] us
[1:03:26] it's a part of us because of the Fall
[1:03:28] it's a part of us because of that Fallen
[1:03:31] nature that was injected into the to the
[1:03:35] human nature by Satan in the beginning
[1:03:41] so now because it was given into
[1:03:43] Humanity guess what it's passed on down
[1:03:46] through you don't have a choice in the
[1:03:48] matter but yet it disguises itself
[1:03:53] it disguises itself in ways that we
[1:03:56] don't realize because we have this
[1:03:58] projection of what pride is
[1:04:09] sometimes many people are prideful of
[1:04:12] the work that they accomplish
[1:04:15] they're prideful of how good it turned
[1:04:17] out they're prideful of how I'm sure the
[1:04:20] person that built this desk is extremely
[1:04:23] prideful of how it turned out because it
[1:04:25] turned out very very nicely
[1:04:29] there's many people that'll take that
[1:04:31] that Pride though which is a good thing
[1:04:36] because if you don't have pride in your
[1:04:38] workmanship your workmanship is never
[1:04:41] going to turn out well
[1:04:42] it's never going to turn out to the best
[1:04:44] of your ability if you don't have pride
[1:04:46] and ownership guess what you're not
[1:04:48] going to take care of anything
[1:04:50] you're not going to take care of your
[1:04:51] home you're not going to take care of
[1:04:53] your card if you don't have that kind of
[1:04:55] pride
[1:04:56] that's a good kind of Pride it's a good
[1:04:59] kind of Pride to have but when it when
[1:05:02] we begin to take this this piece of art
[1:05:06] that we have made this whatever it is
[1:05:08] that you do within your Workforce
[1:05:10] whenever you take that now and you're
[1:05:13] comparing it to somebody else
[1:05:15] now our pride becomes sinful
[1:05:22] so yeah you've got pride of workmanship
[1:05:24] you've got pride of ownership well
[1:05:26] praise God but now you think that it's
[1:05:29] so good that we look at something else
[1:05:31] and we say my
[1:05:33] look at that thing
[1:05:37] there's no way on my job I would leave
[1:05:40] that like that
[1:05:42] there's no way that if I was to do this
[1:05:45] work that I would leave it like that I
[1:05:47] wouldn't leave those joints opened like
[1:05:49] that I wouldn't have stained that thing
[1:05:51] that color I wouldn't have done it that
[1:05:53] way my if I was to do it my I tell you
[1:05:56] what
[1:05:57] this is how I would have done it
[1:06:00] and so now this Pride that you have in
[1:06:03] your workmanship which is good because
[1:06:05] it keeps the workmanship at a high
[1:06:07] quality but now you take that thing and
[1:06:10] you begin to comparing it to somebody
[1:06:12] that leaves it perhaps not up to your
[1:06:15] standards and now the pride in your life
[1:06:18] becomes a sinful Pride
[1:06:20] because you're comparing it and tearing
[1:06:23] down other people's stuff
[1:06:27] oh my house
[1:06:29] did you see that
[1:06:31] did you see that person's house
[1:06:33] did you see how messy their car was
[1:06:36] there's no way
[1:06:37] in my house it's spotless
[1:06:42] that might be
[1:06:44] but now look at the motive and look at
[1:06:46] the objective now that's coming behind
[1:06:48] the words that we're saying it's a
[1:06:51] sinful Pride
[1:06:59] we start comparing or when we start
[1:07:02] comparing ourselves
[1:07:04] to other people when we start comparing
[1:07:07] our workmanship uh whatever it is that
[1:07:10] you that it is that you do to other
[1:07:11] people understand it turns into a sinful
[1:07:15] Pride it's a sinful spirit
[1:07:21] and it starts so subtly
[1:07:25] have you ever seen somebody a new parent
[1:07:28] they get married no praise the Lord and
[1:07:31] a year later whatever it is there's a
[1:07:34] new baby on the way and they have their
[1:07:36] baby
[1:07:37] oh and they're so proud of that little
[1:07:39] baby so proud of that little kid and the
[1:07:43] little thing begins to grow
[1:07:45] and it begins to hold its head up by
[1:07:47] itself oh and the parents are so proud
[1:07:50] and it begins to roll over and it goes
[1:07:53] through life and it learns how to crawl
[1:07:55] then it learns how to how to walk and
[1:07:57] roll over and do all these different
[1:07:59] things and next thing you know it has a
[1:08:01] little tooth appearing and oh my for a
[1:08:04] for a for a parent with their first kid
[1:08:06] it's the best ever they're little
[1:08:08] landmarks
[1:08:11] oh and the pride of Love Is there
[1:08:14] and it's a good thing
[1:08:17] but when that parent now begins to
[1:08:20] compare their sweet little baby
[1:08:24] the best baby in the church
[1:08:27] I remember
[1:08:29] when we first had Mariah I'm gonna undo
[1:08:32] this thing
[1:08:34] I feel like my face is red it's so tight
[1:08:39] I remember when Mariah was first born
[1:08:42] and I I'm an only child I've never been
[1:08:45] around babies and so we bring her to
[1:08:47] church and everything meant she sleep
[1:08:49] through the whole service I thought
[1:08:54] man crying I didn't realize that all
[1:08:56] babies pretty much all they do is sleep
[1:08:58] eat and use the restroom in their diaper
[1:09:02] but I'm thinking oh my the greatest
[1:09:05] child ever
[1:09:09] it's good to be prideful with our
[1:09:11] children but now notice that same parent
[1:09:14] now
[1:09:15] now they go to the other people that
[1:09:17] have children that were the same age
[1:09:20] have you seen my kid has your kid rolled
[1:09:22] over yet
[1:09:25] has your kid held their head up by
[1:09:27] themselves yet
[1:09:28] well when my first kid when they were a
[1:09:31] baby they were walking up nine months
[1:09:33] your kids already 11 months and they're
[1:09:36] not even barely crawling oh my
[1:09:39] and what happens is there's a pride now
[1:09:42] that you have with your children but
[1:09:45] when you begin to compare it to other
[1:09:47] kids within the assembly guess what
[1:09:49] happens third that Pride that was once
[1:09:52] good it now turns for evil
[1:09:55] because now you're comparing Apples to
[1:09:58] Apples and you're saying well my kid is
[1:10:00] better than this one and my family is
[1:10:03] better than this and there's no way I
[1:10:05] would let my kid act like that what is
[1:10:07] happening there's a spirit of Pride
[1:10:09] that's showing its ugly face
[1:10:13] because it's seeing mine is better than
[1:10:17] yours my family is better than yours my
[1:10:21] children is better than yours whether
[1:10:23] they think they're saying it or not
[1:10:32] kids
[1:10:33] how did I tell you I'm a proud parent
[1:10:36] myself
[1:10:37] every chance I get I'm showing people
[1:10:39] pictures of my kids and all these
[1:10:40] different things
[1:10:43] because they can't believe I have five
[1:10:44] kids and that I'm 35 years old
[1:10:48] trust me it's right here look at how you
[1:10:51] can't deny them
[1:10:55] but now what happens is there's it
[1:10:58] changes now so subtly
[1:11:01] and now this Pride begins to raise up
[1:11:03] its face
[1:11:05] and now it's comparing this to that now
[1:11:09] what's wrong with comparing this to that
[1:11:11] notice how slowly this starts
[1:11:15] what happens now if you begin to compare
[1:11:18] your kids with another kid I guess I'm
[1:11:21] talking to the young families here and
[1:11:23] that's okay
[1:11:26] but yet that kid is better than yours
[1:11:31] there's there's one family in the church
[1:11:33] and let me just give you all just a
[1:11:36] warning
[1:11:37] and and then Zach and Lydia Lovell was
[1:11:42] little gwinny little gwinny was born
[1:11:45] with a tooth I believe
[1:11:48] and so if you go to Zach and you start
[1:11:50] to go well my kid started teething at
[1:11:52] this point he'll be like yeah I got you
[1:11:54] beat buddy
[1:11:59] but what happens now is you begin
[1:12:01] comparing these things and what happens
[1:12:03] if the other kid is better than your kid
[1:12:07] what happens within your spirit
[1:12:10] now you can chill
[1:12:13] why do you get jealous because you've
[1:12:16] got Pride
[1:12:17] and pride breeds contentions
[1:12:20] and so now pride is breeding this
[1:12:22] jealousy and you're like well
[1:12:24] well that's whatever you might react I
[1:12:27] don't know what it is but now because
[1:12:30] you're starting to find out that your
[1:12:32] little one or your kids or your family
[1:12:34] isn't as great as you thought it was
[1:12:36] because you start comparing it to other
[1:12:38] people guess what begins to happen now
[1:12:40] you there's a breed of contention in
[1:12:42] your heart against that family
[1:12:45] there's a little seed of envy that
[1:12:49] starts to rise up and you say Well
[1:12:51] they're better than me so you don't
[1:12:54] greet them like you should
[1:12:57] you don't talk to them and embrace them
[1:12:59] after church like you said like you
[1:13:01] should why because you're jealous and
[1:13:03] you don't even know it
[1:13:06] and what happens is now there's this
[1:13:08] there's this Envy in this this this
[1:13:10] jealousy now that that raises and rises
[1:13:14] in the heart and you don't understand
[1:13:16] why
[1:13:18] you don't understand why you can't make
[1:13:20] eye contact with that person anymore you
[1:13:22] don't understand why you can't shake
[1:13:24] their hand like you once used to
[1:13:27] it's because you were comparing and you
[1:13:29] were disappointed
[1:13:31] and you were comparing because there's
[1:13:34] pride in your life
[1:13:37] I believe that that's what's what
[1:13:39] happens with a lot of Ministries they
[1:13:40] compare themselves to other Ministries
[1:13:42] and compare this one to this one and
[1:13:44] don't compare to anything just be
[1:13:46] yourself
[1:13:51] you guys know you can only do the best
[1:13:53] you can with your children
[1:13:55] God has to do the rest
[1:14:00] well my family will never act like that
[1:14:03] don't ever say that
[1:14:06] because God is going to put you through
[1:14:08] a school of humility
[1:14:10] and he's going to Humble you
[1:14:18] when we start comparing ourselves to
[1:14:20] others
[1:14:22] and how others do things it becomes sin
[1:14:25] in our lives
[1:14:27] and guess what
[1:14:29] we all do it
[1:14:31] we are all guilty of it and we have all
[1:14:34] done it at one time or another
[1:14:37] something that started out so good
[1:14:40] something that started out so nice with
[1:14:43] with whatever the the happiness and the
[1:14:45] pride that you had in your family now
[1:14:48] it's sin in your life because we're
[1:14:50] comparing it to everyone around us
[1:14:53] saints of God just be yourselves
[1:14:57] you can't try to be another family
[1:15:01] I can't try to be the McGeary family
[1:15:04] I can't we're mcneelies we can just be
[1:15:08] ourselves we can look at the mcgaris and
[1:15:11] we could say my what a good family
[1:15:13] they've raised their kids right they're
[1:15:15] serving the lord they're musicians in
[1:15:17] the church and everything but
[1:15:19] we still gotta be ourselves
[1:15:22] and you've got to be yourself
[1:15:26] and you've got to let your kids be
[1:15:28] themselves
[1:15:34] I think that's good
[1:15:36] because you've got to let them be them
[1:15:39] you can't let them be who you think they
[1:15:42] should be and amen
[1:15:48] sure
[1:15:51] but Pride
[1:15:53] takes over our lives
[1:15:55] and because of Pride there's contentions
[1:16:00] there was contentions amongst the
[1:16:01] disciples why because they were all so
[1:16:04] prideful they wanted to know who was
[1:16:06] going to be the greatest
[1:16:08] if you want to be the greatest be the
[1:16:09] servant of all
[1:16:11] and don't wait until somebody tells you
[1:16:14] to do it
[1:16:15] but do it yourself on your own accord
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:22] this is something that we are all
[1:16:24] extremely guilty of
[1:16:29] is having Pride
[1:16:31] in our lives
[1:16:36] Pride sometimes
[1:16:37] disguises itself
[1:16:42] it disguises itself in some ways that we
[1:16:46] can't really notice it until it pops up
[1:16:49] its ugly head once too many times
[1:16:53] it's not always just the outward person
[1:16:57] that thinks are the greatest in their
[1:16:59] family is the greatest in all these
[1:17:01] different things but sometimes it's the
[1:17:03] quiet person
[1:17:06] sometimes it's the person that can never
[1:17:08] say sorry
[1:17:12] it's the person that can never say would
[1:17:14] you forgive me
[1:17:17] it's the person that won't take the word
[1:17:20] of God and apply it to their heart why
[1:17:22] will they not walk with the word is
[1:17:24] because of pride
[1:17:32] I remember
[1:17:34] I had a brother ask me one time
[1:17:37] a friend of mine had gotten a nice
[1:17:39] vehicle
[1:17:40] and a brother had asked me he said what
[1:17:43] do you think of that person's vehicle
[1:17:46] that they got
[1:17:47] and it was a very nice very nice vehicle
[1:17:51] and this person's brother was not from
[1:17:53] the U.S he's from a different country
[1:17:55] and he said well what do you think of
[1:17:58] that vehicle
[1:17:59] I said it's very nice very nice car
[1:18:02] person deserves it they've worked hard
[1:18:04] for it well where I come from never
[1:18:07] drive a car like
[1:18:10] that really yeah
[1:18:12] we are far too humble where I come from
[1:18:15] to drive a nice vehicle like that
[1:18:21] okay
[1:18:23] and not realizing
[1:18:26] what he was saying and realizing and
[1:18:30] what he was talking about in his
[1:18:33] humility
[1:18:35] he was being prideful and he was
[1:18:38] boasting of their humility
[1:18:43] so he was thinking because this person
[1:18:46] has a nice vehicle it means that they're
[1:18:49] Vain and they have a lot of pride in
[1:18:51] their lives but his approach and his
[1:18:53] motive and objective behind it and
[1:18:56] seeing that he was trying to put that
[1:18:57] person down to make himself feel good
[1:18:59] not realizing that it was Pride in his
[1:19:04] own life
[1:19:05] that was causing him to think and say
[1:19:07] those things
[1:19:10] and so that's why I can say that Pride
[1:19:13] can disguise itself in humility
[1:19:19] Pride can disguise itself from people
[1:19:22] who are a little less fortunate with
[1:19:25] money and their wealth
[1:19:29] they think that because they're poor
[1:19:31] well the poor shall inherit the earth
[1:19:36] sure
[1:19:37] meek
[1:19:41] so shall the bride
[1:19:45] but you can't say that because I am poor
[1:19:49] because I don't have as much money as
[1:19:51] somebody else that it means that I am
[1:19:53] humble and that they're proud
[1:19:56] it's the motive that's behind it
[1:20:00] it's not the wealth
[1:20:02] but it's the motive that's behind it
[1:20:04] it's not being poor but it's the motive
[1:20:10] so now in there
[1:20:13] poorness is such a bad word I don't know
[1:20:16] what word to say less fortunate whatever
[1:20:19] I don't know
[1:20:22] no I don't go that far
[1:20:25] thank you though
[1:20:29] but they feel because of this
[1:20:32] it means that they're humble
[1:20:36] but being that way and looking at the
[1:20:40] more fortunate person that has more
[1:20:41] money and thinking that they're proud
[1:20:44] and that you're not because of the
[1:20:45] status that's a better word
[1:20:48] you're actually with the lower status
[1:20:50] you're actually prideful
[1:20:53] which is just as bad as the other
[1:20:58] so Pride now it disguises itself
[1:21:01] and it hides itself pride has wrapped
[1:21:05] itself in our DNA
[1:21:09] and we need to be able to point it out
[1:21:13] and recognize it in our lives
[1:21:20] it's all about the motive and the
[1:21:22] objective behind what's being done and
[1:21:26] what's being said I can say the exact
[1:21:29] same thing for dress code
[1:21:33] it was kind of interesting
[1:21:35] at camp this year we had a breakout
[1:21:37] session with the guys of my dorm and one
[1:21:41] thing that I had noticed
[1:21:43] around camp this year was there was
[1:21:47] quite a few young men that have began to
[1:21:50] wear necklaces
[1:21:52] within the message
[1:21:55] so I figured I'd might as well say
[1:21:58] something about it
[1:22:00] kind of discuss it a little bit
[1:22:02] and see what they thought
[1:22:04] because one thing about a minister is
[1:22:06] you've got to preach your convictions
[1:22:10] so personally myself a necklace on a man
[1:22:13] I think a necklace is extremely feminine
[1:22:16] I think a nice little dainty necklace on
[1:22:19] a woman is very pretty
[1:22:21] little bracelet whatever it is but
[1:22:23] whenever we get to put these things on a
[1:22:26] man
[1:22:27] I kind of feel like it's it's it's kind
[1:22:30] of sisified
[1:22:32] and so I had some of the brothers they
[1:22:35] told me they said well that's your
[1:22:37] opinion
[1:22:38] and I said okay fair enough that maybe
[1:22:41] my opinion but my question is this
[1:22:45] what is the motive and the objective
[1:22:47] behind wearing necklaces and Jewelry
[1:22:52] where does it end and where does it stop
[1:22:55] was it okay then for a guy to wear a
[1:22:57] bracelet is it okay for us to go ahead
[1:23:00] and get her ears pierced get her
[1:23:02] eyebrows pierced
[1:23:05] you see these two little holes here on
[1:23:07] my eyebrow
[1:23:09] yeah I have my eyebrow pierced
[1:23:13] two slices on my eyebrow on this side
[1:23:17] I have my one ear pierced
[1:23:19] I had the necklaces on
[1:23:21] gold bracelet
[1:23:23] got a gold ring put it around my
[1:23:26] necklace
[1:23:27] I had rings on my fingers
[1:23:36] I was a cool dude man
[1:23:43] slicing my eyebrow tinting my hair
[1:23:47] everything that made a guy cool
[1:23:50] I did it
[1:23:52] because I wanted to be so cool
[1:23:56] but when the Lord got a hold of my heart
[1:23:59] guess what he took away the eyebrow
[1:24:01] piercing he took away the ear piercings
[1:24:04] he took away my necklaces
[1:24:07] he took away my bracelets he took away
[1:24:10] my swag that I thought I had
[1:24:15] why because it's all worldliness
[1:24:20] and when I came into the message and I
[1:24:22] give my heart to Christ he took my
[1:24:24] worldliness and he gave me a new robe he
[1:24:27] gave me a new spirit he gave me a new
[1:24:29] desire and the things that I once loved
[1:24:32] guess what I don't love those things
[1:24:33] anymore
[1:24:37] so what's the desire about it what's the
[1:24:39] Desire with it
[1:24:41] where does it stop
[1:24:43] where does the Fashion Stop
[1:24:49] I'm gonna look my best
[1:24:52] I'm going to be Decked Out
[1:24:55] where does it stop
[1:24:57] and what's the purpose behind it
[1:25:00] what are you trying to show to people
[1:25:05] what do you want people to think about
[1:25:06] you
[1:25:10] lots of money
[1:25:12] Pride
[1:25:13] had you got good dress sense
[1:25:17] huh
[1:25:18] what are we what are we trying to show
[1:25:20] here
[1:25:21] what are you saying brother Stephen I'm
[1:25:23] just speaking from my heart
[1:25:27] I think those things are feminine
[1:25:29] brother Branham said this
[1:25:31] he said cut bangs on a on a boy's hair
[1:25:34] what does it do to him
[1:25:37] makes him a pervert
[1:25:42] so now what happens if we start taking
[1:25:44] these things which are mainly designed
[1:25:47] for women
[1:25:48] dainty pretty things and we begin to put
[1:25:51] them on boys
[1:25:54] we begin to put them on men
[1:25:56] what does it do to us as young men
[1:26:00] if a haircut did that brother Branham
[1:26:02] said
[1:26:04] I wonder what happens when we put on
[1:26:06] clothing that pertains to a woman
[1:26:14] some down home stuff here this morning
[1:26:18] but I see it
[1:26:20] and if I see it and I don't say anything
[1:26:22] Watchman
[1:26:23] what of the night
[1:26:25] what do you see up there on top of the
[1:26:28] tower let me tell you what I see I see
[1:26:31] manhood being stripped
[1:26:35] I see the the uh a man that once used to
[1:26:39] be masculine the masculinity and a man
[1:26:41] is being taken away from away from us
[1:26:45] and it's a media that's doing it
[1:26:49] oh but he looks so pretty
[1:26:53] you tell my son
[1:26:55] um Henry that he looks pretty
[1:26:58] chances are he's going to try to thump
[1:27:00] you
[1:27:02] that's a fact
[1:27:04] I'm not pretty
[1:27:06] for girls
[1:27:09] I'm handsome that's right son you are
[1:27:12] handsome ain't no pretty little thing we
[1:27:14] don't want no pretty little boys
[1:27:16] we want handsome boys strong boys that
[1:27:20] turn into handsome men and strong men
[1:27:23] and men of character
[1:27:24] [Applause]
[1:27:27] say Amen boys
[1:27:29] I know it hurts but you can say it
[1:27:37] has been taken away from us
[1:27:40] dripped from us
[1:27:45] someone's got to voice it
[1:27:48] someone's got to voice their conviction
[1:27:51] someone's got to say these things
[1:27:54] might as well be us
[1:27:57] that's just your opinion that's fine
[1:28:00] take it or leave it brother Branham said
[1:28:02] hey I have no Bible on this but this is
[1:28:05] my opinion and that's what I'm saying
[1:28:07] this morning
[1:28:08] there's no Bible on it but this is my
[1:28:11] opinion
[1:28:12] you wear a little thing like that looked
[1:28:14] like a
[1:28:17] Billy mckinstry you remember all
[1:28:19] remember Rocco
[1:28:21] my friend his dad
[1:28:24] before he passed couple years ago he
[1:28:27] told me a story one time when I was
[1:28:28] backing out and he said you know young
[1:28:30] fella and uh he's a man's man a young
[1:28:33] fella let me tell you a story
[1:28:36] okay
[1:28:37] he goes there's a a a fella everybody's
[1:28:41] a fella over there
[1:28:42] there was a fella used to walk by my
[1:28:44] house
[1:28:45] big big men wide shoulders walked
[1:28:49] straight he said and this guy you know
[1:28:52] everything about him was a man he was
[1:28:54] old man
[1:28:56] and he said one time I seen him he
[1:28:57] walked past the house and he had his ear
[1:28:59] pierced he'd come out of the army
[1:29:01] he said one time he came past the house
[1:29:03] he had his ear pierced
[1:29:05] and I'm only I'm I'm barely converted at
[1:29:08] this point
[1:29:09] barely converted I had barely taken my
[1:29:12] one earring out
[1:29:14] okay
[1:29:18] he says he was a strapping young man but
[1:29:20] when I seen that ear that earpiece in
[1:29:23] his lobe I told my wife he said that
[1:29:26] young fella is going to get sisified
[1:29:30] and I thought well okay
[1:29:33] continue the story
[1:29:35] he says and every day he'd walk past his
[1:29:37] house next thing I know he was growing
[1:29:39] his hair out next thing I know he was
[1:29:41] doing this and next thing I know he was
[1:29:43] doing that and next thing I know he was
[1:29:45] so sisified that he looked like a woman
[1:29:48] walking down the street where did it all
[1:29:50] start he said it started with the little
[1:29:53] piercing in his ear
[1:29:56] so brother Branham said with the bangs
[1:29:58] and everything where does it start
[1:30:00] it starts with us as parents at home
[1:30:03] saying hey you can't do that and this is
[1:30:05] why
[1:30:11] sisified what is it it's a spirit
[1:30:15] God help us
[1:30:17] to be aware of spirits of the end time
[1:30:22] that's trying to take away our Liberty
[1:30:25] as Christians
[1:30:28] amen
[1:30:31] I had the question within my mind and I
[1:30:33] thought
[1:30:35] what is it that God really hates about
[1:30:38] Pride
[1:30:40] if it's something that he hates so much
[1:30:44] what is the purpose of why he hates it
[1:30:46] there's got to be a reason behind it
[1:30:51] and as I begin to think upon Pride I
[1:30:55] begin to think of the examples within
[1:30:58] the scriptures
[1:30:59] and the more examples that I saw
[1:31:02] throughout the scriptures of men who
[1:31:04] Rose and fell because of Pride I begin
[1:31:07] to realize that pride in a person's life
[1:31:11] and within their heart will do one thing
[1:31:14] it'll cause them to get out of their
[1:31:16] position in Christ
[1:31:20] now follow this thought along with me
[1:31:22] Isaiah 14 13-15 it says for thou Hast
[1:31:27] said in thine heart talking of Lucifer I
[1:31:30] will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[1:31:34] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[1:31:37] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[1:31:39] in the sides of the north I will Ascend
[1:31:42] above the heights of the clouds I will
[1:31:44] be like the most high yet Thou shalt be
[1:31:48] brought down to Hell to the sides of the
[1:31:50] pit
[1:31:52] the seal the Antichrist 1955 brother
[1:31:54] Branham says did you know that in heaven
[1:31:56] that the devil was God's right-hand man
[1:31:58] in the beginning
[1:32:00] that Lucifer the son of the morning was
[1:32:02] given power and the reason that he
[1:32:04] brought sin into the world he was able
[1:32:06] to take something that God had created
[1:32:08] and perverted back into an evil thing
[1:32:10] which started all this trouble in the
[1:32:13] beginning then God back before the
[1:32:15] foundation of the world was ever laid
[1:32:18] when he's seen what Satan had done and
[1:32:21] his pride went over in the north and
[1:32:23] said up a kingdom
[1:32:25] and fought against Michael and his
[1:32:27] angels do you see it the right-hand man
[1:32:29] of almighty God was Lucifer the son of
[1:32:31] the morning the first God granted him
[1:32:34] almost co-workers with him notice he had
[1:32:38] a position in the economy of God and
[1:32:42] that position was he was co-workers with
[1:32:44] God
[1:32:46] he was a co-worker partly equal with him
[1:32:49] only Satan could not create God is the
[1:32:52] only Creator but Satan took something
[1:32:53] that God created perverted it back into
[1:32:56] something else evil and now notice when
[1:32:58] Cain and Abel a very beautiful picture
[1:33:00] of it Cain and Abel was nothing more
[1:33:02] than a prefigure of Judas and Jesus
[1:33:06] so Satan had a position in heaven
[1:33:10] it was a position that was given to him
[1:33:13] from almighty God
[1:33:15] it was a position of authority it was a
[1:33:18] position that he was almost co-equal
[1:33:21] with God
[1:33:22] and whatever happened up in heaven
[1:33:25] but because Pride got lifted up in his
[1:33:27] heart
[1:33:29] because something arose in his life and
[1:33:31] he said what I have in this position
[1:33:33] where I'm at right now is not good
[1:33:37] enough
[1:33:39] I want more
[1:33:42] I want the B is the most high God I want
[1:33:45] to be the one in control I want to be
[1:33:48] the one with all the authority
[1:33:52] and because of the pride in his life The
[1:33:56] Pride that was found in his heart guess
[1:33:59] what happened it caused him to get out
[1:34:01] of his rightful position
[1:34:04] follow me along we're with Moses now in
[1:34:08] the wilderness
[1:34:09] how many remembers Dayton and Cora you
[1:34:12] remember Dayton they rose up and they
[1:34:14] said hey ah Moses isn't the only
[1:34:18] um uh Holy One amongst us
[1:34:21] he's not the only one that can lead
[1:34:23] those people guess what there's more of
[1:34:25] us here that are just as well
[1:34:27] um qualified as he is we're just as holy
[1:34:30] as he is we're just as good as he is
[1:34:33] let's make us captains
[1:34:36] because of pride
[1:34:38] of not being able to follow the
[1:34:40] leadership of God
[1:34:41] by The Authority that God sent through
[1:34:44] Moses because of bride what did God say
[1:34:47] step aside Moses
[1:34:49] step aside I'm going to swallow them up
[1:34:53] because of their pride
[1:34:55] what about you Zaya the king
[1:34:59] God had really blessed Uzziah the king
[1:35:02] and what a mighty king he was until he
[1:35:05] got lifted up in his own Pride God had
[1:35:07] done so much good for you Zion
[1:35:11] he had given him wisdom and he made all
[1:35:13] this machinery for fighting and and
[1:35:15] different things and and and the Kingdom
[1:35:17] of Israel was at a really good place
[1:35:22] but yet something rose up in his heart
[1:35:26] and he thought I can do what I want
[1:35:29] I'm the king of this place
[1:35:32] and so I'm going to go in and I'm going
[1:35:34] to burn incense because God has been
[1:35:36] with me
[1:35:37] God has delivered me God has watched
[1:35:39] over me God has watched over Israel
[1:35:41] under my protection and under my
[1:35:43] authority guess what I can go in and
[1:35:45] through the priest's job
[1:35:47] I can go in and burn some incense it's
[1:35:50] okay
[1:35:52] because of his pride
[1:35:54] as a king he got out of his rightful
[1:35:57] position and he tried to take the
[1:36:00] position of a priest
[1:36:04] Pride will take a man out of his
[1:36:07] god-given position and will make him
[1:36:10] desire something different that he's not
[1:36:13] called to do
[1:36:15] and even when the priests they said hey
[1:36:18] please King don't do it you're not
[1:36:20] called to do this don't step out of your
[1:36:22] position you're a good King you're not a
[1:36:25] priest
[1:36:27] because of the pride in his life it
[1:36:30] turned into anger
[1:36:32] and when it turned to anger he was smote
[1:36:36] with leprosy
[1:36:38] which is a type of sin
[1:36:42] so what was it that led him to that
[1:36:44] certain point it was because of Pride
[1:36:46] that was built up in his life that he
[1:36:49] couldn't take care of
[1:36:54] let me say this
[1:36:57] Pride within the household
[1:36:59] with our sisters it'll cause them to get
[1:37:02] out of their rightful position in Christ
[1:37:05] and go to chasing after
[1:37:07] all kinds of degrees and all kinds of
[1:37:10] work and all kinds of this and all kinds
[1:37:12] of that and all kinds of the other why
[1:37:14] because of pride
[1:37:17] because of the pride of life
[1:37:19] because of the love of money because of
[1:37:21] a a better home whatever it might be
[1:37:24] because of that Pride it causes them to
[1:37:27] get out of their position
[1:37:29] that God has given to us within his word
[1:37:38] what an evil
[1:37:40] ugly
[1:37:40] nasty thing
[1:37:43] that pride is
[1:37:45] Pride will take a man
[1:37:48] in the position of a church
[1:37:53] and think that he can do better than the
[1:37:54] preacher or the pastor
[1:37:58] he's not happy with what he's doing in
[1:38:01] the assembly already and what happens
[1:38:02] Pride will raise up in his life and say
[1:38:05] I can do a better job than this person
[1:38:07] and they get out of position
[1:38:11] and they're chasing something that
[1:38:13] perhaps are not called to why
[1:38:17] because
[1:38:25] Hallelujah
[1:38:30] sometimes we have to be careful as
[1:38:31] Believers of what we say we are going to
[1:38:35] do
[1:38:37] quite often we make a plan within our
[1:38:39] minds and we say well I'm going to do
[1:38:41] this and I'm going to do that and here's
[1:38:43] my three year plan and here's my
[1:38:44] Five-Year Plan and by this time I'm
[1:38:46] going to have this and this amount of
[1:38:48] money saved and I'm going to buy a house
[1:38:49] here and and we have it all mapped out
[1:38:54] from beginning on to the ending this is
[1:38:56] my this is my life's plan
[1:38:58] and so much of the time we neglect to
[1:39:01] ask God if it's his plan for us and our
[1:39:05] time here on Earth
[1:39:08] a lot of times we make rash decisions
[1:39:11] without first encountering like brother
[1:39:14] James said on Wednesday night some God
[1:39:15] talk
[1:39:16] this is my desire this is my plan Lord
[1:39:19] but what is your will for me in my life
[1:39:26] we can read in the Book of Proverbs and
[1:39:29] James it it tells us that Proverbs 27
[1:39:32] and verse 1 it says boast not thyself of
[1:39:36] tomorrow
[1:39:37] for thou knowest not what a day may
[1:39:40] bring forth
[1:39:41] so in other words we shouldn't be
[1:39:43] boasting of what we're going to be doing
[1:39:45] in the next week or the next month or
[1:39:47] the next years because we don't know the
[1:39:49] plan that God has for us
[1:39:53] James 4 13-16 go to now ye that say
[1:39:57] today or tomorrow we will go into such a
[1:40:00] city and continue their year and buy and
[1:40:03] sell and get game whereas you know not
[1:40:05] what shall be in the moral for what is
[1:40:08] your life
[1:40:09] it is even a vapor that appears for a
[1:40:12] little time and then vanisheth away
[1:40:14] for that ye ought to say
[1:40:18] so you're saying these things you're
[1:40:20] going to go into a city you're going to
[1:40:21] get great gain and you're going to do
[1:40:23] this that and the other but ye ought to
[1:40:25] say if the Lord will
[1:40:30] we shall live and do this and do that
[1:40:33] but now ye rejoice in your boasting all
[1:40:37] such rejoicing is evil
[1:40:40] so what are we supposed to say as
[1:40:43] Believers if the Lord will
[1:40:47] so I'm going to make a plan and my plan
[1:40:50] for the next three months is going to be
[1:40:53] this if the Lord will
[1:40:56] my one year plan is going to be this if
[1:41:00] the Lord will I'm going to do this in my
[1:41:04] life if the Lord will
[1:41:09] so now what does that do when you see if
[1:41:13] the Lord will you're still making plans
[1:41:15] you're still making plans for the future
[1:41:17] you're you're still planning ahead but
[1:41:20] what are you doing when you say hey this
[1:41:22] is my plan but if the Lord will I'm
[1:41:24] going to do it
[1:41:25] you're also saying this if the Lord
[1:41:28] doesn't will
[1:41:30] I'm going to be happy with it
[1:41:34] this is the plan in my life if God Wills
[1:41:37] but if it's not his plan for me I'm
[1:41:40] happy to go down a different Road I'm
[1:41:43] happy to go down a different path I'm
[1:41:46] happy to make different choices because
[1:41:48] as a son or daughter of God I want to
[1:41:51] walk in his will
[1:41:54] so that's why Jesus said not my will
[1:41:58] but thy will be done
[1:42:00] so what happens now is and whatever
[1:42:02] happens if your plans work are your
[1:42:05] plans doesn't work you're still happy in
[1:42:08] the Lord
[1:42:11] why because you're walking in the will
[1:42:14] of God
[1:42:19] I did a bid oh it was probably in March
[1:42:23] time and um
[1:42:26] and it was for a pretty nice hotel it
[1:42:29] was a Holiday Inn it kept it up nice and
[1:42:32] everything and um so big deal for me man
[1:42:36] uh hotel and and and the first thing you
[1:42:38] think when you do when you think of a
[1:42:40] hotel is is money
[1:42:43] like this is gonna be nice
[1:42:45] and so I'm crunching all these numbers
[1:42:47] and I've never I've never done a job
[1:42:50] this big before you know bidded by
[1:42:52] myself I've been a part of jobs and and
[1:42:55] helped paint them with brother Amos but
[1:42:57] I've never I've never been the boss of
[1:42:59] one
[1:43:01] so I thought well okay there's there's
[1:43:03] you know a hundred two bedrooms there's
[1:43:06] you know 60 three bedrooms whatever it
[1:43:08] was and crunch all these numbers and I
[1:43:10] think oh my goodness
[1:43:12] that's a ton of money
[1:43:14] and
[1:43:16] um so I send my submittal in and the
[1:43:19] lady goes well
[1:43:20] um Let me let me just say she called me
[1:43:22] up she said let me just say that you're
[1:43:24] very competitive
[1:43:25] okay
[1:43:27] that means you're cheap
[1:43:29] it's not what you want
[1:43:31] I said okay well let me revise it she
[1:43:33] said yes I would advise that
[1:43:36] so pretty much you know times by 33
[1:43:39] whatever it is okay wow
[1:43:41] this is amazing and in your carnal in
[1:43:45] your carnal man you begin to think well
[1:43:46] man this could set me up and and uh set
[1:43:49] the business up and set this up and and
[1:43:51] while praise the Lord and this would be
[1:43:53] so good and and you start to think well
[1:43:54] I hope I get it
[1:43:58] but I prayed to the Lord when I was
[1:43:59] praying about it and I said father if
[1:44:03] this is not your will for me to get this
[1:44:06] job I don't want it
[1:44:08] if I can't handle the stress if I can't
[1:44:12] handle the financial burden if I can't
[1:44:14] handle trying to get guys and and handle
[1:44:17] everything that goes along with the job
[1:44:18] this size I don't want it Lord I want to
[1:44:22] walk in your will
[1:44:25] and so months passed you know and and
[1:44:28] some people ask me uh well did you hear
[1:44:30] back yet no I haven't heard back yet and
[1:44:32] you know this has been so I just put it
[1:44:34] on the back burner
[1:44:36] so it's like a month before the job was
[1:44:38] supposed to start they said Stephen give
[1:44:40] us two more weeks will you still be able
[1:44:42] to do it yeah of course yeah yeah tell
[1:44:44] me the day before I'll be there
[1:44:48] long story short get an email rejection
[1:44:52] I said okay
[1:44:54] praise the Lord
[1:44:57] I was happy
[1:44:58] and I can say before you with an Open
[1:45:00] Bible I was not discouraged one single
[1:45:04] iota
[1:45:06] I wasn't hurt my feelings wasn't hurt I
[1:45:09] didn't feel like well I could have done
[1:45:11] this and I could have done that and this
[1:45:12] that and the other no I said praise the
[1:45:15] Lord God had something else for me
[1:45:20] and so we emailed back and forth and I
[1:45:22] said well there's always next time and
[1:45:24] the lady said no we really wanted this
[1:45:27] job so it wasn't just me that didn't get
[1:45:30] the job it was the whole general
[1:45:32] contractor that did not get the job she
[1:45:35] said just so you know
[1:45:37] if we got the job as a contractor you
[1:45:39] would have got the job
[1:45:42] I didn't want to tell her you shouldn't
[1:45:44] have awarded it to me
[1:45:46] it's my fault
[1:45:48] because God didn't want me to have it
[1:45:51] but I went into the whole situation
[1:45:53] being Lord if it's your will I'll walk
[1:45:56] right through the door but if it's not
[1:45:58] your will Lord I'll walk through all the
[1:46:00] doors that you're opening for me and so
[1:46:02] because of the open-mindedness of the of
[1:46:05] the will of God and the direction in
[1:46:07] which we should walk guess what I was
[1:46:10] happy
[1:46:13] if the Lord will
[1:46:16] this is what we're going to do
[1:46:18] Hallelujah
[1:46:20] you can have that same peace
[1:46:22] because when you approach god with an
[1:46:25] open mindeness and an open heart and you
[1:46:27] say father you know my wants but if the
[1:46:30] Lord will and if you don't will I'll
[1:46:34] walk in that other will
[1:46:38] because God's no
[1:46:40] is as good as his yes
[1:46:46] questions and answers 19 1959
[1:46:50] God has a hard time trying to get
[1:46:52] somebody that he can deal with that'll
[1:46:54] stay humble
[1:46:56] and me can stay in the place until God
[1:46:59] calls them to do something you believe
[1:47:01] that a man that God can bless and he'll
[1:47:05] still keep himself a man not be an angel
[1:47:08] or a God as soon as man gets blessed and
[1:47:11] has a little something given to him he
[1:47:13] wants to become a God he wants to become
[1:47:15] an angel he wants to become some great
[1:47:18] person what I do me and me and mine that
[1:47:22] all
[1:47:23] that's the wrong attitude
[1:47:28] God's hunting for someone who can who
[1:47:31] could bless and pour out the blessings
[1:47:33] and more he blessed the littler the man
[1:47:36] will become
[1:47:37] and you'll never get more of God until
[1:47:39] you become nothing you've got to
[1:47:42] belittle yourself he that will exalt
[1:47:44] himself God will bring a base he that
[1:47:46] will humble himself God will exalt
[1:47:48] you've got to be little before you can
[1:47:50] be big and you'll never be big in your
[1:47:53] own self you'll only be as big as God
[1:47:56] will be big in you
[1:48:01] how easy it is
[1:48:03] for a servant of God and a minister
[1:48:07] to get so lifted up within himself when
[1:48:10] God begins to bless his ministry
[1:48:14] it's like brother Yvonne said you know
[1:48:16] stars that arise they fall
[1:48:19] they're falling stars
[1:48:22] what happens is brother Branham is
[1:48:24] saying that God will take a man and
[1:48:25] he'll begin to bless his ministry and
[1:48:28] this and that and it's so hard for the
[1:48:30] man to stay humble it's so hard for the
[1:48:33] man to say uh you know what it's not me
[1:48:37] that's doing the work it's God
[1:48:42] but what we see
[1:48:44] we've seen it amongst the message for
[1:48:46] Years brother Brad I'm saying uh God
[1:48:49] will bless a man and he wants to be an
[1:48:50] angel or a god we've seen it
[1:48:53] we've seen the man that we're not called
[1:48:55] to it and when they got into that
[1:48:57] position they got so lifted up within
[1:48:59] their pride that had caused a whole mess
[1:49:04] why
[1:49:05] because they're going into a position
[1:49:07] that they're not called to
[1:49:12] and what does it mess up
[1:49:15] it messes up their own life
[1:49:17] and everybody who's sitting underneath
[1:49:19] their Ministry
[1:49:21] it's just a mess why because pride gets
[1:49:25] raised up within their lives
[1:49:31] so easy for a man
[1:49:33] to get exalted
[1:49:35] I remember when I prayed for this sick
[1:49:37] person and they got healed
[1:49:39] I remember I preached such a dynamic
[1:49:41] service that the power of God failed and
[1:49:43] it was all because of me and and my
[1:49:45] Ministry and this person no no no no no
[1:49:47] no
[1:49:48] it's not because of you
[1:49:50] it wasn't because of you praying for the
[1:49:53] sick person that it got healed it was
[1:49:54] because of their faith it was because of
[1:49:57] God it was because of God moving on the
[1:50:00] scene
[1:50:02] so there's that fine balance of giving a
[1:50:05] testimony and saying well glory to God
[1:50:09] he did this back then and saying when I
[1:50:13] did this
[1:50:15] I prayed for this sick person I prayed
[1:50:18] for that I did this I did that
[1:50:22] it's so easy for us as Ministry to get
[1:50:25] caught up with it
[1:50:27] I don't know if I put the code in here
[1:50:29] or not but I'll just say it anyways
[1:50:31] brother Brandon was talking about
[1:50:35] um it was the next service and he was
[1:50:38] talking about the service before and how
[1:50:40] they didn't give out prayer cards and
[1:50:41] and so now he's going to hand out prayer
[1:50:43] cards and uh
[1:50:45] uh the night before they didn't hand out
[1:50:47] prayer cards but they didn't need the
[1:50:49] prayer cards he said and I called the
[1:50:51] people out
[1:50:52] in the audience he was talking about the
[1:50:53] Holy Spirit he goes excuse me excuse me
[1:50:56] I didn't mean to say that
[1:50:59] he said he called the people out
[1:51:03] it wasn't me that did it you see he
[1:51:06] realized his wording was of a prideful
[1:51:11] uh substance
[1:51:13] and he said I'm sorry I didn't mean to
[1:51:16] say that it wasn't me that was God
[1:51:21] I don't know these people I don't know
[1:51:23] their names I don't know where they'd
[1:51:25] come from I don't know their sickness
[1:51:27] but he knows
[1:51:30] and so I think it's so important for us
[1:51:33] to be very careful
[1:51:36] because God has a body that he uses and
[1:51:39] that's the Bride of Jesus Christ and we
[1:51:41] claim that that's us right
[1:51:43] so when God uses you because he has no
[1:51:45] other hands ears eyes nose hands no
[1:51:48] other tongue but yours when God uses you
[1:51:51] it's important to say this is what
[1:51:53] happened but God be the glory
[1:51:57] it wasn't me that done it I didn't have
[1:51:59] the words but it was God Almighty that
[1:52:01] did the works
[1:52:05] amen
[1:52:08] the anointed ones at the end time
[1:52:11] now I want you to know this is sure
[1:52:15] and you that listen to this tape you
[1:52:17] might have thought today that I was
[1:52:19] trying to say that about myself being
[1:52:21] that I was packing this message I have
[1:52:24] no more to do with it than nothing
[1:52:27] and no more than just a voice so what is
[1:52:30] he doing now he's saying hey this isn't
[1:52:33] me this isn't nothing to do with me I'm
[1:52:35] just a voice I'm just a vessel this is
[1:52:37] God
[1:52:40] I have no more to do with it than
[1:52:42] nothing just a voice of my voice even
[1:52:44] against my own better judgment I wanted
[1:52:46] to be a Trapper but it's the will of my
[1:52:48] father that I declare to do and and
[1:52:51] determined to do I wasn't the one that
[1:52:53] appeared down in the river I was only
[1:52:55] standing there when he appeared I'm not
[1:52:58] the one that performs these things and
[1:52:59] foretells these things that happens as
[1:53:01] perfect as they are I'm only one that's
[1:53:04] near when he does it I was only a voice
[1:53:06] that he used to say it it wasn't what I
[1:53:08] knew it's what I just surrendered myself
[1:53:11] to that he spoke through it isn't me it
[1:53:14] wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh
[1:53:17] no it was the manifestation of the son
[1:53:19] of man notice he's given all the glory
[1:53:22] to God because he realizes he has
[1:53:26] nothing to do with it against my own
[1:53:28] better judgment
[1:53:33] he says it's God
[1:53:35] God the angel was not the son of man
[1:53:39] you hear what he's saying
[1:53:42] this seventh angel messenger is not the
[1:53:47] son of man
[1:53:50] Hallelujah now he's distinguishing who
[1:53:53] he is and who he is not
[1:53:56] and so when we try to put him in that
[1:53:58] place we're misquoting we're mislocating
[1:54:02] we are doing the things that he told us
[1:54:04] not to do
[1:54:08] he said the angel was not the son of man
[1:54:12] he was the messenger from the Son of Man
[1:54:19] the son of man is not Christ
[1:54:24] well
[1:54:25] the son of man is Christ sorry
[1:54:29] that's what I get for looking up thank
[1:54:31] you
[1:54:34] he is the one that you're feeding on
[1:54:37] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[1:54:40] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:54:43] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:54:46] man
[1:54:48] what is he doing he's distinguishing
[1:54:50] himself he's saying as John the Baptist
[1:54:53] Hallelujah he says his shoe shoelaces
[1:54:56] I'm not even worthy to lease
[1:54:58] there's one that's coming after me I'm
[1:55:01] not I'm not even worthy to be on the
[1:55:03] same platform as this guy this guy
[1:55:05] that's coming behind he's the one
[1:55:07] that'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:55:09] and Fire he's the one that you need to
[1:55:12] look to it's not me he's doing the exact
[1:55:14] same thing he's saying hey this is not
[1:55:16] me I'm just a messenger
[1:55:21] but because of misquoting things like I
[1:55:24] just did see how easy it is
[1:55:28] now can you imagine English not being
[1:55:30] the first language
[1:55:32] can you imagine a people
[1:55:37] that we're not paying attention to the
[1:55:38] quote
[1:55:40] this corrects a lot of good stuff I'm
[1:55:42] glad it happened
[1:55:43] can you imagine not putting the court up
[1:55:45] here
[1:55:47] and I'm reading it and I make a mistake
[1:55:50] because I'm a man and I make a mistake
[1:55:52] and I'm getting caught up with looking
[1:55:55] around me and trying to preach that I
[1:55:57] don't read the thing correctly
[1:56:00] and it's not up here what does everybody
[1:56:02] think
[1:56:03] they think what I said because I'm
[1:56:06] reading from a quote so the importance
[1:56:08] of putting it up here for everybody to
[1:56:11] see the quote you can say hey preacher
[1:56:14] you made a mistake you said it wrong say
[1:56:17] it right
[1:56:21] but without this
[1:56:23] without a people that's listening
[1:56:25] without a people that's doing their
[1:56:27] homework guess what there's mislocations
[1:56:29] there's Miss quotations
[1:56:32] it gets out of order the cart gets
[1:56:35] before the horse next thing you know is
[1:56:37] the cows on top of the tree pecking
[1:56:39] grass why all because of a simple
[1:56:42] mistake
[1:56:45] amen
[1:56:47] thank you Lord
[1:56:56] this school of humility
[1:56:59] is a school that each one of us must go
[1:57:02] through
[1:57:03] possibly many times within our lives
[1:57:08] because it is within our human nature
[1:57:11] for Pride to rise in our hearts and in
[1:57:14] our lives time and time again
[1:57:18] why because it is wrapped and it is
[1:57:21] Twisted within our DNA
[1:57:24] and it'll poke up its ugly face every
[1:57:27] once in a while and so God now has to
[1:57:30] take us through a school of humility to
[1:57:34] keep us humble before his very sight
[1:57:38] and we'll get into it in the next
[1:57:40] service of why he does that why does he
[1:57:43] want to keep us humble why does he not
[1:57:45] want us being proud
[1:57:47] the scripture has the answer
[1:57:50] the door to the heart
[1:57:52] 1958 Pride keeps us from doing it
[1:57:56] we're afraid somebody will say something
[1:57:58] against us when the spirit blesses many
[1:58:00] are ashamed to say Amen we should never
[1:58:02] be ashamed to say Amen
[1:58:07] there is many who in their office work
[1:58:09] the Lord Jesus could have healed them of
[1:58:11] diseases and they're afraid to testify
[1:58:13] to the glory of God because of Pride
[1:58:17] many are afraid to stand and say I have
[1:58:20] received Christ as my personal Savior
[1:58:23] and have been filled with the Holy
[1:58:24] Spirit they're ashamed oh I love that
[1:58:28] little old song we used to sing years
[1:58:29] ago down in the rich country I'll take
[1:58:31] my way with the Lord despise few I've
[1:58:33] started with Jesus and I'm going through
[1:58:35] not ashamed of the gospel Paul said it's
[1:58:38] the power of God Pride oh what a great
[1:58:42] thing that it is
[1:58:45] Pride he says keeps us from doing it
[1:58:50] so what does pride keep us from doing
[1:58:53] Pride keeps us from fulfilling the word
[1:58:56] of God
[1:58:57] Pride keeps us from applying the word of
[1:58:59] God to our hearts
[1:59:01] even when it's contrary to our own
[1:59:04] reasonings and thinkings
[1:59:07] Pride keeps us from it
[1:59:09] well I know the Bible said that
[1:59:12] and yeah I know it says about modesty
[1:59:14] and I know it says about this but I just
[1:59:17] can't do it
[1:59:19] I don't want to do it
[1:59:21] I don't want to testify to people I
[1:59:23] don't want to tell people that I'm a
[1:59:25] Christian why because
[1:59:30] well I'm just too shy
[1:59:37] I'm not loud like you
[1:59:40] I'm not
[1:59:42] boastful and Brash like you are
[1:59:47] yeah I'm quiet so I don't say anything
[1:59:50] they'll know
[1:59:52] Pride
[1:59:55] Pride will keep you from testifying to
[1:59:57] the person who's in the cubicle next to
[1:59:59] you at work
[2:00:03] you don't know what they'll think about
[2:00:04] me well who cares
[2:00:05] Pride will keep you from testifying to
[2:00:08] the people at school and people at work
[2:00:09] of what God is doing in your life
[2:00:12] Pride see pride disguising itself
[2:00:17] well they might ask me to play ball
[2:00:19] anymore
[2:00:20] I mightn't be a part of the boys anymore
[2:00:22] I mightn't be there say yeah Pride
[2:00:27] see we all have a certain amount of
[2:00:29] pride that's keeping us from the word of
[2:00:31] God being fulfilled in our lives
[2:00:36] but I thought proud I thought it was
[2:00:38] just bash and boastful and and all these
[2:00:41] different things no no no no no no no
[2:00:43] Pride will keep you from doing it
[2:00:47] Pride will keep you from saying sorry
[2:00:50] when you were wrong
[2:00:54] Pride will keep you from asking for help
[2:00:56] we're in your when you're in a hard spot
[2:01:01] Pride will keep you from reaching out to
[2:01:03] those that you know need help
[2:01:08] you say well it's just my
[2:01:10] um
[2:01:11] what's what's the word
[2:01:14] um uh the thing that you struggle with
[2:01:16] in your mind your uh
[2:01:18] complexes yeah that's my complex it's
[2:01:20] not it's not as your pride
[2:01:26] your pride oh blame it on your complexes
[2:01:29] Pride
[2:01:34] right why is there contentions amongst
[2:01:36] us
[2:01:39] you know a soft answer turns away
[2:01:42] Wrath
[2:01:44] so if there's contentions in a family
[2:01:48] what is the issue
[2:01:52] it's not how you were raised
[2:01:55] it's not how your mom and dad acted
[2:01:57] because a lot of us blame that stuff
[2:02:00] from Mom and Dad
[2:02:02] it's not because how your family was not
[2:02:04] just because of your pride
[2:02:08] that you can't swallow it and make
[2:02:11] things right
[2:02:19] amen
[2:02:23] it is pride that keeps us from doing or
[2:02:26] fulfilling the word of God in our lives
[2:02:28] when we hear it
[2:02:29] and that's why God has to put us through
[2:02:31] these times of testings and Times of
[2:02:34] Trials because he wants to take the
[2:02:37] pride out of our Lives because he wants
[2:02:40] a humble people that he can work through
[2:02:43] and live in
[2:02:46] as the musicians come we'll start
[2:02:48] bringing this to a close
[2:02:55] trials and testings
[2:02:58] exactly
[2:03:00] you know they're sent from God
[2:03:07] there's many reasons and many things why
[2:03:10] we go through these trials and testings
[2:03:13] but the main purpose of it is because
[2:03:15] God is working on our character
[2:03:19] like gold tried in the fire
[2:03:23] Robert didn't know what I was preaching
[2:03:24] on so what is it this God has one thing
[2:03:28] that he wants to bring forth in our
[2:03:30] lives and that's the christ-like
[2:03:32] character which comes as pure gold
[2:03:36] and what does the what does the fire do
[2:03:39] what does the trials do what do these
[2:03:41] things that we go through it burns up
[2:03:43] the dross and burns up the things the
[2:03:46] word hay and the stubble in our lives
[2:03:47] that doesn't belong there
[2:03:50] and it makes us get serious in humility
[2:03:53] with God
[2:03:55] because we realize you know what a trial
[2:03:57] does
[2:03:58] you know when you mess up in your life
[2:04:01] do you know what it does when you make a
[2:04:02] mistake it makes you realize where
[2:04:05] you're at
[2:04:07] because God knows exactly where you're
[2:04:10] at in your life he knows exactly where
[2:04:12] you're at in your journey but he wants
[2:04:14] you to realize where you're at and he
[2:04:17] wants you to realize the things that you
[2:04:20] need to work on as a believer
[2:04:22] [Music]
[2:04:24] and so he'll put something in your life
[2:04:25] that'll cause your feathers to get all
[2:04:27] fluffy
[2:04:30] it cause you to get all ruffled up why
[2:04:32] because he wants you to realize what you
[2:04:34] need to work on
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:41] so Peter in our opening scripture
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:46] it said Jesus had told him Peter's one
[2:04:49] of these guys man you talk about
[2:04:52] an outward appearance of pride and
[2:04:54] arrogance and boastful and and and just
[2:04:56] and just put the sword in his hand and
[2:04:58] I'll I'll live and I'll die by The Sword
[2:05:00] and I'll do this and if there was one
[2:05:02] person it's Peter
[2:05:04] there's anybody that's going to sit with
[2:05:06] Jesus it's going to be me I tell you
[2:05:07] what
[2:05:09] so now Peter was a man that was chosen
[2:05:12] of God
[2:05:12] [Music]
[2:05:15] but in that present State he could not
[2:05:17] be used by God
[2:05:19] because his character and his attitude
[2:05:21] and his life wasn't right
[2:05:23] because if God would have used him for
[2:05:25] something guess what he would have took
[2:05:27] all the glory to himself
[2:05:31] so Jesus says to him
[2:05:33] Satan once has desired to sift you as
[2:05:36] weed Peter
[2:05:38] you know what sifting wheat is
[2:05:40] it's going on the thrashing floor
[2:05:43] is being beat
[2:05:44] and the wheat is being beaten and after
[2:05:46] the wheat is beaten it's thrown up in
[2:05:48] the air and what's happening is it's a
[2:05:51] separation time
[2:05:53] the weed is beat because
[2:05:56] that hard Shale that surrounds it has
[2:05:58] got to be broken open so the the pure
[2:06:01] seed can come forth
[2:06:04] he says Satan has desired to sift you
[2:06:06] just as this week
[2:06:08] but I have prayed for you
[2:06:11] Peter are you listening
[2:06:14] put your name there
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:17] Satan has desired to sift you as wheat
[2:06:21] but Jesus has prayed for you
[2:06:27] did not know that he was going to go
[2:06:29] through some of the darkest few days and
[2:06:31] weeks of his life the greatest
[2:06:32] temptations that he let himself down
[2:06:37] he let the disciples down he let the
[2:06:39] Savior down he let everybody around him
[2:06:42] down by his actions of denying the Lord
[2:06:45] but yet God was using this this trial
[2:06:49] this dark place in his life because he
[2:06:52] had a work for him to do in the future
[2:06:56] [Music]
[2:06:57] do you think that humble Peter
[2:07:02] I bet your bottom dollar did
[2:07:07] I deny them
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:12] I've been following him all these years
[2:07:15] and it came to the time when he needed
[2:07:17] me
[2:07:20] and I wasn't there for him
[2:07:22] do you think he slept at night
[2:07:27] do you think he was doing good in his
[2:07:29] life no
[2:07:31] it was a time of Darkness it was a time
[2:07:33] of trial it was a time of pain but yet
[2:07:36] in the darkness God was molding his
[2:07:39] character
[2:07:43] and so now we find Peter after Pentecost
[2:07:47] him and John they go to the temple to
[2:07:49] pray Acts 3 verse 12 and it says and
[2:07:51] when Peter saw it he answered unto the
[2:07:54] people a man of Israel why Marvel ye at
[2:07:57] this or why look ye so earnestly in us
[2:07:59] as though by our own power or Holiness
[2:08:00] we have made this man to walk what had
[2:08:03] happened
[2:08:04] they were going to pray and there was a
[2:08:07] man that was lame everybody knew him he
[2:08:09] was always there at the same spot
[2:08:12] and he pulled him up to his feet the
[2:08:14] Lord Jesus healed him miraculously and
[2:08:17] he went and he was he was he was walking
[2:08:19] and he was jumping and he was leaping
[2:08:21] and he was praising God
[2:08:22] and so now Peter says what I just read
[2:08:25] why are you looking at us
[2:08:27] why are you looking at me we have
[2:08:30] nothing to do with this it wasn't
[2:08:32] anything that we had done but it was him
[2:08:34] who you have crucified who's been raised
[2:08:37] from the dead he is the one that give
[2:08:39] this man back his health
[2:08:44] a week or two prior to that no doubt
[2:08:47] Peter would have said
[2:08:48] look what we did
[2:08:51] they rejoiced
[2:08:53] they rejoiced you remember they said oh
[2:08:55] even the devils are subject onto US
[2:08:57] praise the Lord we're gonna do some
[2:09:00] things for God and everything is subject
[2:09:02] onto us and God is going to the
[2:09:03] miraculous things
[2:09:07] they were rejoicing that things were
[2:09:09] subject to them earlier on in the
[2:09:11] scriptures
[2:09:13] but now he says hey guess what I know
[2:09:16] for a fact that I have nothing to do
[2:09:18] with this
[2:09:20] because I denied him I let him down I
[2:09:23] let everybody down if God does something
[2:09:25] through me it's God that's doing it and
[2:09:27] I'm going to give God the glory and so
[2:09:30] now his attitude and his character now
[2:09:32] was molded and it's changed through the
[2:09:34] trial and the suffering in the dark
[2:09:36] place that he went through
[2:09:39] that's what God now has to do with every
[2:09:41] single believer he has to take us
[2:09:44] through the school of humility so that
[2:09:47] we realize hey guess what I know my
[2:09:50] faults I know my failures I know the
[2:09:53] things that I struggle through and if
[2:09:55] God does something for you through me
[2:09:57] guess what all glory be to the most high
[2:10:00] God
[2:10:03] [Music]
[2:10:05] so why does God take us through this
[2:10:08] school
[2:10:09] because he has no other body that he
[2:10:11] uses but his own body
[2:10:14] and so now so that we don't get high and
[2:10:16] lifted up within our own lives
[2:10:20] because of this Pride that has weaned
[2:10:22] itself through our DNA guess what he has
[2:10:24] to do he has to put us through a sifting
[2:10:26] time
[2:10:29] a time of separation
[2:10:31] a time of separating the flesh from the
[2:10:34] spirit a time of separating the natural
[2:10:36] and the spiritual man why is he doing it
[2:10:39] because he has a purpose for your life
[2:10:41] in the future
[2:10:44] let's Stand Together
[2:10:51] sometimes we ask and we say
[2:10:55] why
[2:10:58] you'll find out soon enough
[2:11:02] a lot of times we look back in our lives
[2:11:04] then we realize uh-huh
[2:11:06] now I understand
[2:11:08] now I realize why
[2:11:12] [Music]
[2:11:14] foreign
[2:11:15] what's god making known to you this
[2:11:16] morning
[2:11:18] he's making known to you guess what
[2:11:21] in your humility guess what you got
[2:11:23] Pride
[2:11:25] in your wealth guess what you got pride
[2:11:27] and you're not so being wealthy guess
[2:11:29] what you got Pride
[2:11:31] within this carnal man there's nothing
[2:11:33] but Pride that dwells within them
[2:11:37] and so now as Believers we need to
[2:11:40] realize and say where is the pride in my
[2:11:44] life
[2:11:45] [Music]
[2:11:47] what good is it preaching about it
[2:11:50] what good is it and mention it and
[2:11:52] showing it throughout the scriptures and
[2:11:54] everything if we don't do anything about
[2:11:56] it
[2:11:57] [Music]
[2:11:58] if you don't do anything about it it'll
[2:12:00] do you no good
[2:12:02] so what are you going to do with this
[2:12:04] word this morning
[2:12:05] [Music]
[2:12:09] because you have two choices
[2:12:11] [Music]
[2:12:13] Choice number one is you can accept the
[2:12:15] challenge
[2:12:17] and you can accept that it's true
[2:12:19] and say you know what
[2:12:23] I can be pretty prideful
[2:12:25] whether it's with my family with my work
[2:12:27] whatever it may be I don't know
[2:12:31] but are you going to recognize it and do
[2:12:33] something about it are you just going to
[2:12:36] sit in your pride and say
[2:12:38] that wasn't for me
[2:12:40] I don't have no Pride that he's talking
[2:12:43] about the choice is yours
[2:12:46] so the challenges went forth
[2:12:50] what are you going to do with this Jesus
[2:12:52] called Christ what are you going to do
[2:12:55] with this Challenge and this word that
[2:12:57] has went forth
[2:12:59] [Music]
[2:13:01] I'm going to do my best
[2:13:04] and do something about it in my own life
[2:13:10] because it starts right here
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:14] I care we had a
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:18] I was ministering or whatever on the
[2:13:20] Thursday night and
[2:13:22] I said you know what guys you need to
[2:13:26] yield to the spirit you need to feed the
[2:13:28] spirit
[2:13:29] through prayer and reading your Bible
[2:13:31] and so I said how about you get up in
[2:13:34] the morning before devotion and you go
[2:13:36] and you pray and you read your Bible and
[2:13:39] seek God
[2:13:40] I said you know what I'll go with you
[2:13:43] I'll be there whether you're there or
[2:13:44] not I'll be there
[2:13:46] I think to myself afterwards
[2:13:49] why do I do this to myself
[2:13:52] yeah be at church nine o'clock okay I'll
[2:13:55] be there
[2:13:56] it's because I want to lead by example
[2:13:59] and I found out to my surprise that
[2:14:03] the first day man there's probably 25
[2:14:06] young man there 6 30 in the morning
[2:14:09] we didn't talk we didn't say a word I
[2:14:13] never spoke
[2:14:14] we sat and we had our own personal time
[2:14:16] with God
[2:14:17] they met the challenge of the word
[2:14:20] the next morning there was probably 30
[2:14:24] young people there
[2:14:26] and so they sat through that now why
[2:14:29] were they doing that it wasn't because
[2:14:30] of me it's because they have the desire
[2:14:34] to seek out God
[2:14:37] and the challenge went forth and they
[2:14:39] met the challenge
[2:14:41] and I know that our desire this morning
[2:14:44] as we want to be like our Lord
[2:14:47] we want to have a closer walk with him
[2:14:49] the challenge has went forth now are you
[2:14:52] going to meet the challenge of the hour
[2:14:55] and say father
[2:14:57] show me
[2:14:59] show me
[2:15:00] if I don't know Lord show me
[2:15:03] because I want to do something about it
[2:15:06] show me where my pride is show me my
[2:15:08] faults Lord because my desire is a son
[2:15:11] and daughter of God
[2:15:16] let's pray this morning Father
[2:15:19] we love you so much Lord
[2:15:21] Lord I personally feel challenged by
[2:15:25] Your Word
[2:15:27] in my own life
[2:15:29] father God Pride sometimes it can
[2:15:32] disguise itself Lord
[2:15:35] and many times it goes unnoticed
[2:15:39] and your word says that
[2:15:41] you hate that thing
[2:15:43] Lord we don't want to do anything that
[2:15:46] hates you that you hate
[2:15:48] but Lord we want to do that which is
[2:15:50] pleasing in thy sight
[2:15:52] and so I asked this morning that you
[2:15:54] would help us as a body as individuals
[2:15:57] Lord revealed to us father our short
[2:16:00] goings and our shortcomings that Pride
[2:16:03] that's in our life father reveal it to
[2:16:05] us that we might give it to thee Lord
[2:16:08] for we know that you'll take nothing
[2:16:10] from US unless it's given to you
[2:16:14] we ask for your blessings now upon the
[2:16:18] people here Lord your children we ask
[2:16:21] that you would be with them Father God
[2:16:23] and bless them and may we be blessed not
[2:16:26] with natural things and materialistic
[2:16:29] things as it were father but by a closer
[2:16:33] walk and relationship by you when we go
[2:16:36] to sleep at night Lord may you be in our
[2:16:39] thoughts when we rise in the morning
[2:16:41] Lord may you be the first thing Upon Our
[2:16:44] Minds father God may we have time of
[2:16:47] prayer where we can enter in Lord uh is
[2:16:51] standing in the gap for one another
[2:16:53] father may we have a refreshing
[2:16:56] outpouring of your Holy Spirit In Our
[2:16:59] Lives Lord not just in the church
[2:17:01] building not just on a Sunday and a
[2:17:03] Wednesday father God but every day Lord
[2:17:06] father when we're driving in our car may
[2:17:09] we be touched by a thought or a song
[2:17:11] that we're listening to Lord me when
[2:17:13] we're when we're home with our family
[2:17:15] father may you anoint us to say the
[2:17:18] right things of encouragement to our
[2:17:20] family Lord
[2:17:24] father God
[2:17:26] that we might walk so close to you
[2:17:28] because we know it's going to happen one
[2:17:30] day
[2:17:31] Lord as Enoch was that in a moment in
[2:17:35] the twinkling of an eye he was not and
[2:17:39] we will be not Lord
[2:17:42] we ask these favors now in the name of
