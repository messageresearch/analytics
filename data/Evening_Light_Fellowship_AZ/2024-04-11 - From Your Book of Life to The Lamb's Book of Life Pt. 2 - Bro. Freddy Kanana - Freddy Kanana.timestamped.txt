[21:01] uh yeah he was at church from what I
[21:04] have been told he was at church early he
[21:07] was either going to be there for
[21:09] counseling or something and one of the
[21:10] brothers came in and they found him on
[21:13] the on the floor and uh so uh be praying
[21:18] for the church be praying for his family
[21:22] uh because it's it's very unexpected so
[21:26] far as we know and everything um I
[21:29] enjoyed brother Peter he was one of the
[21:31] few men that I knew within the the
[21:33] gospel uh that was a real gentleman you
[21:37] know he and uh men like Harold Becket
[21:40] and Peter Chandler they're just
[21:42] gentlemen U and so I I'm going to miss
[21:46] him uh be praying for Sandy and i a week
[21:49] from today a week from today we're
[21:52] traveling to South Africa and so the
[21:56] meetings that we had had scheduled for
[21:58] January was supposed to be there for
[22:00] dibl and Zoe for their wedding and we
[22:03] couldn't and and everything but the
[22:05] meetings that I had for Emanuel Gospel
[22:08] Center um and then for brother Ruben
[22:11] Daniel um we had to cancel those so what
[22:14] I'm doing is I'm fulfilling a an
[22:17] obligation that I had given to them way
[22:20] back in January so the Lord willing
[22:23] we're going to be traveling to U South
[22:26] Africa so be praying for us because uh
[22:29] it's a long trip and uh everything and
[22:32] so we'll be preaching um the Sunday that
[22:36] we get there at Emanuel Gospel Center
[22:39] and then that evening we'll be having
[22:42] communion and foot washing with the
[22:43] Saints there then we'll spend a little
[22:46] bit of time go down and see brother
[22:47] Brian Jones down there in in Maho Holo
[22:51] and take a couple days and uh just enjoy
[22:55] ourselves there in the African bush and

[23:24] couple we're going to travel a little
[23:26] bit and see some sites and so um and I I
[23:30] I I tell you the truth that hosting
[23:34] meetings is much more pressure and
[23:37] nerve-wracking on me than ministering
[23:40] them oh yeah I'd rather preach the
[23:43] convention than I would to hosted
[23:45] because in hosting you got this and that
[23:47] and you're juggling all this and uh you

[35:11] Brothers to kind of project them on the
[35:13] screen but I realized I didn't click
[35:17] sign I was like what's happening
[35:21] here yeah not that
[35:26] old I thought maybe it's a short notice
[35:28] that the the pastor has sent me last
[35:30] Friday but Freddy would you mind taking
[35:32] the service on Wednesday say yes I
[35:35] looked at Wednesday the 10th I was like

[35:39] week
[35:42] man I was like okay and I was telling
[35:45] the pastor back there when uh brother
[35:48] Gideon kasonga was here he spent some
[35:51] time with us it's my place him and I
[35:54] having fellowship and he was asking me
[35:57] uh how much time does the pastor give
[35:59] you before you go to the pulpit I told
[36:02] him two to 3 weeks said that's a
[36:05] lot and he said the way he learned the
[36:09] way he was trained by his Pastor when uh
[36:12] brother viida noticed that he has a
[36:14] Ministry the
[36:16] gift he came over to his place at 400
[36:19] p.m. on a Saturday was like I was
[36:22] looking for you you get a priest
[36:24] tomorrow like
[36:26] what he was telling me I was like what
[36:29] he said I didn't read I didn't eat I
[36:34] didn't pray I didn't prepare myself so
[36:36] what am I going to do read pray
[36:38] sleep
[36:40] what so he did what he did on that
[36:44] Sunday the worst part of it was another
[36:47] Sunday cuz he was a deacon in the church
[36:50] he was at his post of Duty singing like
[36:53] the rest of the people
[36:54] and and then he saw another deacon
[36:57] coming to him was like brother it's the
[36:59] time for you to go to the pulpit
[37:01] what that's the way he was
[37:04] trained but I don't want to brother run
[37:06] to do
[37:08] [Applause]
[37:17] that
[37:21] so that's the way we Are Soldiers so we
[37:25] need to be prepared yes sir in season
[37:28] and out of season
[37:32] amen there's no question about it when
[37:35] the Holy Spirit will pick on you you got
[37:36] to do the
[37:38] job so you pray for
[37:41] me and uh so that I can deliver my
[37:46] message that I have in my heart so the
[37:50] my sermon tonight is from your book of
[37:52] life to the Lamb's Book of Life it's a
[37:55] part
[37:56] two and for subject is the true
[37:59] worshippers we worship the father in
[38:02] spirit and in truth
[38:07] amen I think I have to repeat myself
[38:09] tonight again so to make myself um um
[38:15] understood as we journey through this
[38:19] life we do things because brother bam
[38:22] says when we are born there is a spirit
[38:25] that God has ordained to occupy is body
[38:28] of
[38:30] Flesh and that spirit will cause us to
[38:33] say things and do things that will be
[38:36] held
[38:37] accountable to us and we need to respond
[38:41] for those things that we have said and
[38:42] those that we have done
[38:46] evil like brother bam says in the
[38:51] message Christ is revealed in his own
[38:55] word he says when you are born God sets
[38:59] a record on or a recorder
[39:03] on it don't make or put a record on it
[39:06] don't make much noise for a little while
[39:10] you know that's the little
[39:12] baby till it comes to accountability
[39:16] then the noise
[39:18] starts he starts saying things and doing
[39:21] things he has to answer
[39:24] for and when the life ends the record or
[39:29] tape is took off and laid in the great
[39:34] big library of
[39:35] God now how are you going to get around
[39:39] it at the Judgment bar it's played right
[39:43] back in front in front of you every move
[39:46] you made every thought that went through
[39:48] your mind can you see
[39:51] that you see so we do things in this
[39:56] life
[39:58] good and
[40:03] evil is God is recording
[40:06] them and baram says in one of the
[40:11] message when we're born the Spirit come
[40:13] in
[40:14] us and in a certain period of time we
[40:17] have to make a choice to
[40:19] worship to worship God because with the
[40:23] five senses of this Spirit we have love
[40:27] right
[40:27] that's ail of
[40:29] love that will make us worship you make
[40:33] us love God and love
[40:39] people and in Genesis chapter
[40:44] 6 God repented after he saw the
[40:46] condition of the earth and how people
[40:49] were just uh um evil and he he repented
[40:55] and he said my spirit wants wife with a
[40:58] human being because he's a flesh and his
[41:01] days are only
[41:03] 120 because by bam says before the
[41:08] fall I mean right after the fall Before
[41:11] the Flood I meant to say people used to
[41:14] live a little longer amen and after the
[41:17] flood our numbers our time here on the
[41:20] Earth was
[41:21] reduced so from 120 and if you go with
[41:25] the book of uh in uh p Psalms
[41:29] 90 chapter 90: 10 that's the prayer of
[41:32] Moses he
[41:34] said our time here on the Earth was
[41:37] reduced to 3 score and 10 which means 70
[41:41] years from 120 to
[41:44] 70 and here when he he talks about the
[41:48] recorder being put on they don't put it
[41:50] on the day you are born it's after a
[41:54] moment when you reach the age of
[41:56] accountability and then they start
[41:57] recording your stuff so when I say from
[42:01] your book of life to the Lamb's Book of
[42:03] Life which means because the book talks
[42:05] about
[42:06] life whatever you have done in this
[42:09] life so the teaching on the books
[42:12] brother Ron did it in detail this is
[42:15] just a jumping board that I'm using to
[42:17] go uh bring my point
[42:22] across so God will record all of that
[42:26] until the time you will make a decision
[42:28] to start worshiping
[42:31] him and in this Spirit we can go to
[42:33] church we can do
[42:35] things we have the first uh worshippers
[42:39] we have Cain and
[42:40] Abel all of them that were in the
[42:42] message of that hour and the pastor was
[42:45] God himself preaching them his word all
[42:48] of them they have the same
[42:49] benefit but one had Revelation the other
[42:53] one didn't have
[42:55] Revelation Abel was connected told the
[42:57] father Cain was not connected true even
[43:01] though he did evil God came back to him
[43:04] yes rehearsing some things telling him
[43:07] to do exactly follow do what your how
[43:10] your brother is doing if you do exactly
[43:13] how he did then you'll be considerate or
[43:16] your offering will be considerate but
[43:19] since he didn't have since he didn't
[43:21] have that seed in him since he was not
[43:24] the elect right he didn't take it
[43:28] seriously and he ended up slaying his
[43:33] brother so he was
[43:37] worshiping in this body in this Spirit
[43:39] he was
[43:40] worshiping but he didn't have a
[43:43] revelation he didn't know what he was
[43:46] worshiping we have
[43:49] Moses he heard from his mother how he
[43:53] was going to be a redeemer how he's
[43:55] going to be uh bringing the children of
[43:57] Israel out of the
[43:59] bondage but with his own strength as a
[44:02] human being was trying to do that he was
[44:04] a
[44:06] religious and he ended up killing an
[44:11] Egyptian until the
[44:13] time where God appointed him to to be
[44:17] called to really do the
[44:20] job butam says it
[44:23] took 4 years for him to be to have the
[44:27] doctrines of Egypt in him and it took
[44:30] God 40 years again to remove all of that
[44:34] from his life amen and Bam says that's
[44:37] how it's supposed to be the deeper you
[44:40] went in the world when you receive
[44:42] Christ you have to go even deeper in
[44:45] Christ to balance things
[44:50] out and Moses was a killer though he was
[44:54] a Believer but he killed
[44:57] he was doing evil and he was doing good
[45:00] at the same time we have
[45:04] Paul he learned from
[45:07] Galia one day he was persecuting the
[45:10] Believers he thought in his mind he was
[45:12] worshiping God which he did but he
[45:15] didn't know what he was worshiping amen
[45:18] he didn't have a revelation it was just
[45:20] his Spirit he was going to church as a
[45:24] matter of fact he has some notes to
[45:25] persecute the believer
[45:27] right and he did was
[45:31] violent until the day he made the pill
[45:33] of fire
[45:36] Hallelujah and when he met God he was a
[45:38] changing
[45:41] man he made God
[45:43] first and he went straight to the
[45:48] world three three years and a half
[45:52] butam searching the
[45:54] scriptures and he ended up
[45:57] with one statement a strong one Jesus
[46:00] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[46:02] forever
[46:04] amen we have
[46:06] Peter very
[46:08] aggressive he was in the message of that
[46:11] hour yeah right he was in the message
[46:14] but the message was not in him
[46:19] yet one day he was aggressive when the
[46:22] soldiers came to get the the
[46:24] Lord pulled out his knife and cut off
[46:27] the the ear of the the soldier the Roman
[46:29] soldier amen and the Lord looked at him
[46:32] and said no this is not uh physical
[46:35] thing Affairs this is spiritual mother
[46:38] and he put the ear back
[46:41] Hallelujah one
[46:44] day Peter he came to the Lord cuz the
[46:47] Lord saw him he knew they were flesh
[46:49] they were weak in the flesh one time he
[46:51] called them to go prayer in the
[46:55] mountains they didn't stay in the prayer
[46:57] for that long not even one hour and he
[47:01] said the flesh your spirit is willing
[47:03] but your flesh is weak he understood
[47:05] them because they were still in this
[47:07] side of worshiping they were worshiping
[47:10] but not truly
[47:13] worshiping amen and one day he called
[47:19] him we are in uh Book of
[47:24] Luke chapter 22:31 1 to ver
[47:30] 34 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold
[47:33] Satan ha desired to have you that he may
[47:38] sift you as
[47:40] weit but I have prayed for thee that thy
[47:45] faith fail
[47:48] not and when thou art
[47:51] converted strengthen thy Brethren amen
[47:55] and he said unto him Lord I am ready to
[47:59] go with you with with thee both into
[48:02] prison and to
[48:05] death and he said I tell you that's this
[48:09] is the Lord telling uh Peter I tell thee
[48:12] Peter the shall not crawl this day
[48:16] before thou before that thou shall thri
[48:21] deny that thou knowest me amen see he
[48:25] was in the message
[48:28] you see he was in the message going to
[48:30] church coming back but he was not
[48:33] converted because the the Lord he knows
[48:36] everything amen and he said when you
[48:39] will be converted strengthen your
[48:42] brother don't forget my subject is the
[48:46] true
[48:47] worshipper we worshiping the father in
[48:50] spirit and in truth that's what we're
[48:53] talking about
[48:55] here
[48:59] David he was a man after God's
[49:02] heart he did good things and he defeated
[49:07] Goliath on his you in his
[49:10] youth but one day he did an evil thing
[49:17] adultery but when he met the Lord when
[49:20] God sent Nathan the prophet to him with
[49:23] a
[49:24] message he realized this is a message
[49:27] coming from the Lord he took it
[49:29] seriously and you saw all the Psalms how
[49:31] he cried
[49:33] out to the point
[49:36] where God gave him his enemy
[49:39] Soul because of the love of God because
[49:42] this is David after
[49:45] conversion he couldn't kill
[49:48] Saul his soul just not kill him he he's
[49:51] following you try to kill you no no no
[49:53] no no he's a servant he's an anointed of
[49:55] God
[49:57] he just got the Hem of His uh robe and
[50:01] then showed him I would have killed you
[50:03] but you
[50:05] know one
[50:07] day A crippled man and spilled on his
[50:10] face he Soldier we need to take his head
[50:13] off I said no the Lord knows amen you
[50:17] see that's David after the true
[50:25] conversion it just same with
[50:27] us you see people coming to church and
[50:31] day in and day out sometimes doing evil
[50:34] things doing Godly
[50:36] things you
[50:40] know if you don't have the spirit of God
[50:42] if you don't receive the Holy Spirit
[50:45] then it's going to be tough for you
[50:47] that's why the Lord told the disciples
[50:50] ter you in
[50:52] Jerusalem because he knew all of them
[50:54] were not converted yet even though were
[50:56] in the message but the message was not
[50:58] in them like the children of Israel that
[51:01] were in Egypt for a long
[51:03] time until that the Egypt was in them
[51:08] when they left
[51:10] Egypt they were in the
[51:12] wilderness they've been bothering Moses
[51:15] the
[51:17] prophet When Death sets in when they
[51:20] were facing troubles and things they
[51:22] said we should have stayed in in in
[51:24] Egypt because the Egypt was was in them
[51:27] they left Egypt but Egypt was still in
[51:30] them the disciples were in the message
[51:33] but the message was not in
[51:35] them that's why the Lord could see all
[51:38] of
[51:38] that he knew their
[51:43] weaknesses and he told them go and wait
[51:47] until the power from on high will come
[51:50] on
[51:51] you and look at the
[51:54] Peter after they received the Holy
[51:56] Spirit
[51:59] was a different man oh that's
[52:02] right because he was
[52:05] converted all the things they heard from
[52:08] the Lord they were even questioning the
[52:10] Lord what about this what about that
[52:12] when the Holy Spirit came on in on in
[52:14] their lives he was leading them through
[52:17] all of that amen because the Lord says
[52:19] I'm not going to leave
[52:21] you alone comfortless but I was saying
[52:25] the spirit my father will send the
[52:27] spirit the
[52:28] comforter in my name thank you Lord he
[52:33] will lead you in through all the truth
[52:35] he will bring to your remembrance what I
[52:37] have told you even tell you things to
[52:42] come we all go through
[52:47] that in the Book of
[52:55] Ezekiel
[52:58] The Book of
[53:00] Ezekiel chapter 36:
[53:03] 24 to
[53:09] 27 don't forget this
[53:16] is God talking to
[53:20] Israel and the same way he dealt with
[53:22] Israel is the same way he was dealing
[53:24] with the church
[53:27] he said for I will take you
[53:28] [Music]
[53:30] from among the the
[53:32] Heathen and gather you out all the
[53:36] countries and I will bring you into your
[53:38] own
[53:39] land then I will
[53:42] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[53:46] shall be clean from all your
[53:51] fithness and from all your Idols will I
[53:55] cleanse you
[53:57] a new heart also will I give
[53:59] you and a new
[54:03] spirit I will put within you and I will
[54:06] take away the Stony heart out of your
[54:10] flesh and I will give you in heart or
[54:15] flesh and I will put my
[54:20] spirit within you and cause you to walk
[54:24] in my statutes
[54:27] amen and you shall keep my
[54:30] judgment and do them
[54:34] amen this is
[54:36] God remember
[54:38] before um the Covenant he made with uh
[54:43] Abraham he had a covenant with
[54:47] Adam whereas if you do this I'll do this
[54:50] if you do this I'll do this but he
[54:53] realized that a man is just he's weak
[54:56] amen an unjust man and a just God we
[55:00] could we can't it doesn't
[55:03] fly but he changed it to another
[55:07] Covenant and he made it with
[55:10] Abraham where you don't have to do
[55:13] nothing you only have to depend on what
[55:15] I've
[55:17] done God I have everything don't you
[55:23] worry this is what he's doing here
[55:26] I'll gather you from all the Heathen
[55:29] countries I'll bring you into your own
[55:32] land I'll take out the Stony heart and
[55:36] I'll give you a heart of Flesh amen I'll
[55:39] give you a new spirit am the spirit that
[55:41] will be yielded to the leadership of the
[55:44] Holy Spirit a spirit that will say Amen
[55:47] to the word of God not only that but
[55:50] I'll give you my spirit which is the
[55:52] holy
[55:54] spirit don't forget the Lord
[55:57] like brother bam says when he went back
[56:04] because
[56:06] Moses God showed him what he had done
[56:09] what we didn't see but Moses saw that
[56:12] and with John God took him a little
[56:15] farther but in these last days God took
[56:19] us way farther than all the prophets
[56:23] praise the lord we even knew what was
[56:24] going on in the back pack of the man of
[56:27] of
[56:28] God and we know that because of the
[56:32] message of the
[56:33] hour bam is telling us that because the
[56:36] Bible says God is spirit amen and the
[56:40] true worshippers we worship Him in truth
[56:45] and in spirit that's right what is truth
[56:50] yeah Jesus said father sanctify them by
[56:53] the truth your word is truth
[56:56] amen amen yes and Bam says God is a
[57:02] great being was fulfilling the time in
[57:04] the
[57:05] space there was nothing not even an atom
[57:08] not nothing molecule nothing was only
[57:12] God but in him he has attribute Amen to
[57:15] be father to be son to be savior to be
[57:18] all of that right how could he express
[57:20] it because he was fulfilling the time
[57:21] and the
[57:24] space he created out of him came the
[57:28] logos the pill of fire which we saw
[57:31] above the
[57:32] prophet he said that's the Son of God he
[57:36] came out of the father father's
[57:40] bosom and B say the holy spirit that was
[57:44] fulfilling the time in space condensed
[57:46] itself in that body of the word amen you
[57:50] see God is Spirit we have to worship Him
[57:54] in spirit and truth amen a question was
[57:58] asked himam what should a Believer do to
[58:03] grow up spiritually he said read the
[58:05] word and
[58:09] pray because we have to Worship in
[58:11] spirit and in
[58:14] truth when Moses was leading the
[58:16] children of
[58:18] Israel was not just leading them like
[58:23] that he was leading them because he was
[58:25] commissioned by God to lead
[58:27] them he was acting according to the word
[58:30] of God like bam says if the Lord didn't
[58:33] send you don't go
[58:36] right because when you face troubles
[58:38] over there it's going to be you and you
[58:41] alone but if he commissioned you to do
[58:43] something he will back you up amen and
[58:47] every single time when the children of
[58:48] Israel were giving Moses problem uh
[58:51] problems Moses was turning back going to
[58:55] God he was connected with the spirit yes
[58:58] he was connected with the
[59:00] father and he was showing him what to do
[59:04] yeah and when he he passed
[59:07] on God looked in the congregation he saw
[59:10] Joshua he told him stand up he gave he
[59:14] gave him an
[59:16] encouragement cuz he saw a gift in him
[59:19] amen stand up you're going to take
[59:23] over right and look the how Joshua led
[59:27] the children of Israel and he told
[59:29] Joshua you have to
[59:32] meditate you don't have to do anything
[59:34] like that no no you do it according to
[59:37] the prescription of Moses because that's
[59:39] my word
[59:40] amen you have to do it according to the
[59:43] word of God Amen Moses was I mean Josh
[59:47] was doing that
[59:48] following the advices from the Lord and
[59:52] when he was encountering the problems he
[59:54] was going back to the Lord he was
[59:55] connecting with the spirit he was
[59:57] connected with the
[59:59] father he was worshiping in truth and in
[1:00:09] spirit now God says I'm going to gather
[1:00:11] you from all the
[1:00:13] countries the Heathen one I will put you
[1:00:16] in your own land I'll clean you I'll
[1:00:19] give you a new heart for you to obey my
[1:00:24] word
[1:00:41] to write the Old
[1:00:44] Testament Moses didn't go just
[1:00:46] hophazardly and then no no no he had to
[1:00:51] have the experience with God Amen he
[1:00:56] made the load in the burning
[1:01:00] bush after he made the load that's how
[1:01:04] he wrote the Old Testament
[1:01:07] book Paul did the
[1:01:11] same after he met the Lord face to
[1:01:15] face he had the burning bush experience
[1:01:20] too he saw God in the form in the first
[1:01:23] form he revealed himself to the
[1:01:25] humankind
[1:01:27] that's how he wrote the New
[1:01:30] Testament and in this end
[1:01:33] time to bring the interpretation of the
[1:01:35] old in the New Testament William
[1:01:38] brandham had to come here in
[1:01:39] Arizona had to meet the
[1:01:45] Creator the pillow of fire yes had to
[1:01:48] meet with God Amen that's why we have
[1:01:51] the interpretation of the new in the Old
[1:01:55] Testament
[1:01:56] and B botom says this form this hello
[1:02:00] this pill of fire that's the
[1:02:03] attribute of the fullness of God yes
[1:02:09] hate you believe
[1:02:13] that and by bam says this
[1:02:18] attribute in one of the messages he he
[1:02:21] spoke it in many messages he said it's
[1:02:22] not far from he from me and as a matter
[1:02:25] of fact he he's dwelling in me
[1:02:30] now why to manifest the son of man or to
[1:02:34] reveal the son of man was not William
[1:02:37] brandham but it was God he said not me
[1:02:40] the angel in me amen we don't worship
[1:02:43] William brandham that's the angel
[1:02:46] because Jesus said what took
[1:02:50] place in Sodom and gomorra will take
[1:02:53] place a the revealing of the the son of
[1:02:57] man not what happened now not what
[1:03:00] happened in the time Jesus was here on
[1:03:02] the earth because Jesus brother bam says
[1:03:05] that's the attribute that's the fullness
[1:03:08] of God Head badly even the body that's
[1:03:12] God
[1:03:13] himself but in Genesis
[1:03:16] 18 that was a
[1:03:19] man like you and I and Bam says they
[1:03:22] questioned him where did God get that
[1:03:25] body he said said he took the same
[1:03:28] Earth because we are composed we are
[1:03:31] formed from the earth that has 16
[1:03:34] elements the same God took the Earth and
[1:03:37] formed three bodies one Michael come in
[1:03:41] the other one Gabriel and the other one
[1:03:43] he dwelt himself and after he finished
[1:03:46] his mission on here on the earth he left
[1:03:49] and that body went back to the
[1:03:53] dust so I want you to get that just just
[1:03:55] came
[1:03:57] freely
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:07] so Abel received a true revelation of
[1:04:11] what took place in the Garden of
[1:04:15] Eden but abam says how would that boy
[1:04:19] know what took place if it wasn't for
[1:04:22] the Holy Spirit revealing to him right
[1:04:27] true we need to be
[1:04:30] connected cuz if you're not connected
[1:04:32] then nothing will
[1:04:36] happen and when Jesus told the disciple
[1:04:39] to
[1:04:40] stay until the power from on high will
[1:04:43] come on
[1:04:48] them he knew what he was talking
[1:04:53] about and I'm going to ask you a
[1:04:55] question
[1:04:58] the Pentecostal people they are
[1:05:01] worshiping they going to churches
[1:05:03] they're praying and they do all of
[1:05:06] that what makes them different from
[1:05:12] us here's the
[1:05:16] answer we were
[1:05:19] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:05:21] world thank you Lord we are the elect of
[1:05:25] God
[1:05:27] we were predestinated we can come back
[1:05:29] to our
[1:05:32] scriptures kind of going back and forth
[1:05:34] and I don't know how the Lord will
[1:05:39] lead in Ephesians chapter
[1:05:45] 1:3 Paul said blessed blessed be the God
[1:05:48] and the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:51] Christ who ha blessed us with all the
[1:05:54] spiritual blessings but says we have
[1:05:56] been blessed before the foundation of
[1:05:58] the world all the Heavenly uh spiritual
[1:06:02] blessings he
[1:06:05] said according as he hath chosen Us in
[1:06:08] him before the foundation of the
[1:06:12] world that we should be
[1:06:16] holy even our
[1:06:18] Holiness you have to be chosen before
[1:06:21] the foundation of the
[1:06:22] world otherwise you're going to make
[1:06:24] your own effort
[1:06:26] and at the end of it you're going to
[1:06:29] quit because bam says Judah is scariot
[1:06:34] he Jed at a certain
[1:06:36] time and the evil spirit kind of obeyed
[1:06:39] even him and he
[1:06:42] rejoiced along with other disciples but
[1:06:45] Jesus told them don't Rejoice because of
[1:06:48] the evil spirit we subject to you but
[1:06:50] rather Rejoice because your names are
[1:06:53] written in the Lamb's Book before the
[1:06:55] foundation of the
[1:06:59] world because bam says he jined with
[1:07:03] them
[1:07:04] until that
[1:07:08] day before the uh the uh the event of
[1:07:13] the uh the coming of the Holy Spirit he
[1:07:16] was gone
[1:07:17] already because he couldn't keep
[1:07:20] up he was not the
[1:07:24] elect
[1:07:27] John Luke and all the
[1:07:30] disciples they made it through and they
[1:07:33] receed the holy
[1:07:37] spirit
[1:07:38] so through this life we do things
[1:07:43] and we go to church we do Godly
[1:07:46] things but we need absolutely to have
[1:07:50] the burning bush
[1:07:52] experience says it's not only the
[1:07:54] Believers even us behind the
[1:07:58] pulpit if if you don't have that
[1:08:00] experience you don't have the right to
[1:08:01] be behind this sacred desk amen you have
[1:08:04] to have the burning bush experience
[1:08:07] let's read the prophet in the
[1:08:09] uh in the message
[1:08:13] Vision the Patmos
[1:08:16] Vision he's repeating um John I was in
[1:08:20] the spirit isn't that beautiful my I
[1:08:25] love that
[1:08:26] you could just call those
[1:08:29] words the whole of the Christian Life if
[1:08:33] we are going to live as Christians we
[1:08:35] have to be in his spirit amen John was
[1:08:40] not talking about being in his which
[1:08:43] means in his
[1:08:46] spirit that would not have brought these
[1:08:50] Visions amen it had to be the spirit of
[1:08:54] God Amen it has to be the spirit of God
[1:08:58] with us too all all our efforts are in
[1:09:04] vain Paul said I will pray in spirit I
[1:09:08] will sing in spirit I will live in
[1:09:11] spirit
[1:09:12] amen if there is anything good that will
[1:09:15] come to me it has to be revealed by the
[1:09:19] spirit confirmed by the
[1:09:24] word
[1:09:26] and made manifest in the result it Bears
[1:09:31] because Jesus said my words are spirit
[1:09:33] and
[1:09:34] life you see word spirit and
[1:09:41] life as surely John needed to be in the
[1:09:45] spirit to receive these tremendous
[1:09:48] Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to
[1:09:51] be in the spirit to understand the
[1:09:53] Revelation that God has given given to
[1:09:55] us to live by in his word for it is the
[1:10:00] same Spirit
[1:10:03] look look at it this
[1:10:07] way all too many read the Bible where it
[1:10:11] says in Acts 2:38 repent and be baptized
[1:10:16] and every one of
[1:10:17] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:10:21] remission of the sins and you shall
[1:10:24] receive the gift gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:27] and just pass right on they don't see it
[1:10:31] if they saw it by getting in the
[1:10:34] spirit they would know that if they want
[1:10:39] to receive the Holy Spirit they need to
[1:10:41] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:10:44] the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of the
[1:10:46] Lord Jesus and then God would be Duty
[1:10:49] bound to fulfill his word by filling
[1:10:53] them with the Holy Ghost amen they never
[1:10:56] getting in the spirit or it would happen
[1:11:00] to them exactly as the word says pray to
[1:11:05] God for Revelation by his spirit amen
[1:11:09] that is the first step get in the spirit
[1:11:13] amen let me just use another
[1:11:16] illustration suppose you need healing
[1:11:19] what does the word say well we have all
[1:11:23] read we have all read it countless
[1:11:27] time but did not get in the spirit when
[1:11:31] reading
[1:11:32] it did we ask God for his Spirit to
[1:11:35] teach us the real truth of it yes
[1:11:38] sir if we did we would call the
[1:11:43] Elders confess our sins be anointed and
[1:11:47] prayed for and that would be
[1:11:52] that it might not come immediately
[1:11:56] but in his Spirit it is all
[1:12:00] over there is no other quot to of
[1:12:04] appeal God will fulfill his word oh we
[1:12:08] need to get in the spirit and then
[1:12:12] things will be done don't go through the
[1:12:16] ACT first get in the spirit and then go
[1:12:19] through the act and watch God will do it
[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:27] if it wasn't getting in the spirit
[1:12:30] ezekiah would have been
[1:12:33] dead you
[1:12:35] see when when God sent the prophet
[1:12:38] Isaiah with a message of him living the
[1:12:42] Earth he took it seriously because he
[1:12:45] knew that this message comes from God
[1:12:49] am the Bible says he turned back and he
[1:12:53] look in the wall and start praying
[1:12:57] earnestly so his prayer took him up in
[1:13:00] the presence of
[1:13:04] God he saw God face to face and the
[1:13:08] prophet Isaiah
[1:13:10] left because of his communication Isiah
[1:13:13] communication and God God sent another
[1:13:16] message to his
[1:13:19] Prophet because he was in the
[1:13:22] spirit if it wasn't praying in spirit
[1:13:26] would have been something
[1:13:28] else and the prophet Isaiah where he was
[1:13:31] he was sure this is the message from God
[1:13:34] see what is taking place now because he
[1:13:37] was in the spirit amen and he made God
[1:13:39] face to
[1:13:42] face he touched the Throne of God and
[1:13:44] God sent another message to his prophet
[1:13:46] and Isaiah was obligated to come back
[1:13:48] and give a different message
[1:13:51] amen when barabam was praying for the
[1:13:55] young lady that was sick for nine or so
[1:13:57] years he was giving his experience he
[1:13:59] said he went up to the mountain to pray
[1:14:02] go this way too many rocks couldn't
[1:14:05] kneel down go that way tilting leaning
[1:14:09] this way he couldn't kneel down he go
[1:14:12] the other side
[1:14:15] mosquitoes and he was finally he say you
[1:14:17] know what mosquitoes can do whatever
[1:14:18] they want I flew my hands up and I was
[1:14:21] lost in the prayer couldn't hear the
[1:14:24] mosquitoes couldn't feel anything he
[1:14:26] says that's praying in spirit
[1:14:30] amen you get my point
[1:14:33] worshiping in spirit and in
[1:14:37] truth and he got the
[1:14:40] result after he got out of that
[1:14:46] prayer the prophet of the prophet of God
[1:14:49] says
[1:14:54] in
[1:14:55] in the lamb Lamb's Book of
[1:14:59] Life he says now believer have you got
[1:15:04] your joy shoes on listen to this if you
[1:15:08] are a
[1:15:10] Christian if you are truly God's child
[1:15:14] the Bible
[1:15:15] say that's not a old preacher like
[1:15:20] Freddy
[1:15:21] here that's the
[1:15:23] Bible it's said your name was written in
[1:15:26] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:15:28] foundation of the world oh
[1:15:31] my the same time that Christ that God
[1:15:35] sent Christ to be
[1:15:37] slain he wrote your name with his
[1:15:41] hallelujah hallelujah there you are your
[1:15:45] name was
[1:15:46] written in he said
[1:15:50] and he deceived all
[1:15:53] Greatful so many were church members we
[1:15:58] don't want to be church
[1:16:01] members pretended
[1:16:03] Christians he deceived all whose names
[1:16:06] were not written not in the church book
[1:16:10] but in the Lamb's Book of Life when
[1:16:13] before the foundation of the world God
[1:16:16] wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:19] Life by his spoken word and sa Christ
[1:16:23] the sacrifice to God
[1:16:25] to redeem that same
[1:16:28] group I believe all of us who were there
[1:16:31] that same group
[1:16:32] amen that he had wrote their names in
[1:16:36] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:16:38] foundation of the
[1:16:40] world like bam
[1:16:43] says we made the choice to follow God
[1:16:47] not now not today we made a choice
[1:16:51] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:16:54] and God knew
[1:16:56] who would and who wouldn't make a right
[1:16:59] choice those that have chosen
[1:17:01] him he put the names in the Lamb's Book
[1:17:05] of
[1:17:06] Life those are the one that Christ had
[1:17:09] to come down here to die
[1:17:13] for and you can tell they recognized him
[1:17:16] when he came here on the earth that's
[1:17:17] right that's why he were was having
[1:17:19] conversation with the Pharisees telling
[1:17:22] them all kind of story they didn't get
[1:17:24] it
[1:17:25] he said now I understand you are not of
[1:17:26] my disciples amen cuz my disciples they
[1:17:30] understand my
[1:17:31] language they've been
[1:17:33] somewhere with God
[1:17:37] hallelujah they've seen me somewhere
[1:17:39] familiar places familiar voices right
[1:17:42] I'm doing the same thing I did back then
[1:17:44] but you don't recognize
[1:17:46] it guess what even in hell even in in in
[1:17:50] in um in Paradise when when Jesus went
[1:17:54] there the Believers still recognize him
[1:17:58] butam says they didn't have to to start
[1:18:01] questioning
[1:18:02] no look at the way he was presenting the
[1:18:05] descending of Jesus Christ in hell he
[1:18:08] started with the non-believers when he
[1:18:10] was coming there he presented himself to
[1:18:12] them he introduced it to because they
[1:18:14] didn't have any clue of what he
[1:18:16] was but look at when he was going to the
[1:18:19] Believers when they saw him each and
[1:18:22] every one of them saw Christ coming in
[1:18:26] the form they saw him on the earth he
[1:18:29] didn't have to introduce himself to them
[1:18:31] they had the Revelation because they
[1:18:33] were with them before the foundation of
[1:18:34] the world this is the key thing tonight
[1:18:40] amen and with this Jesus said
[1:18:43] Rejoice because your name are written in
[1:18:47] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:18:49] foundation of the world Hallelujah and
[1:18:51] you make sure you're going to win the
[1:18:53] battle amen yeah if you're not of the
[1:18:56] elected you're not going to win the
[1:18:59] battle you will quit halfway that's
[1:19:03] right
[1:19:07] so let's continue reading the
[1:19:23] prophets he said in
[1:19:26] the in the message
[1:19:29] Israel and the
[1:19:31] church he said don't be
[1:19:33] deceived you better search this now
[1:19:38] no yep there we go if you keep on saying
[1:19:42] well it don't condemn me to do this it
[1:19:46] don't condemn me to do that things of
[1:19:50] the
[1:19:51] world now I'm going to hurt you just a
[1:19:54] little
[1:19:55] bit pull the feathers back the other way
[1:19:59] but it's this one sure
[1:20:03] evidence you have never been to
[1:20:07] Christ you've never been born
[1:20:11] again here is the difference between us
[1:20:13] and the rest of the
[1:20:16] worshippers when we receive the Holy
[1:20:18] Spirit since we have the seed of God in
[1:20:21] our
[1:20:22] souls it will Quicken the that seed and
[1:20:26] for us it's it's a new birth whereas for
[1:20:29] them that spirit will only anoint this
[1:20:32] their Spirit there's no seed in them
[1:20:35] amen for us it's a new birth because we
[1:20:37] have the seed of God that was put in us
[1:20:40] before the foundation of the world but
[1:20:42] for the rest it's only the anointing and
[1:20:44] Bam says
[1:20:47] to to prove that they are not of the
[1:20:50] elected bring the
[1:20:51] word a woman should not preach oh no she
[1:20:54] can preach Deborah no Deborah was not a
[1:20:59] was not a
[1:21:00] preacher bam says the the period where
[1:21:04] Deborah she was not even she was not a
[1:21:06] preacher she was a
[1:21:07] judge that period of time Israel didn't
[1:21:10] have any prophet and God instead sent
[1:21:14] judges Deborah was not a
[1:21:18] minister see bring the word and see how
[1:21:21] they react to the
[1:21:23] word you will for sure know they are of
[1:21:26] the deected or they are not the elected
[1:21:28] right amen it's only the
[1:21:32] anointing they can go pray for the sick
[1:21:35] the sick can get healed because Judah
[1:21:37] Iscariot did it too but his name was not
[1:21:40] written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:21:45] Life and when the Holy Spirit come in
[1:21:47] you comes in
[1:21:49] you when you are being being born
[1:21:52] again you will be about the father's
[1:21:55] business
[1:21:57] amen because Jesus himself with the Holy
[1:21:59] Spirit in him God showed him how Satan
[1:22:03] was coming was trying to get
[1:22:07] Peter to get done with
[1:22:10] him and he told Peter Simon
[1:22:13] Simon Satan was looking was after you
[1:22:16] but I prayed for you to strengthen your
[1:22:19] faith thank you Lord and he told him
[1:22:22] when you be converted strength stren
[1:22:24] your
[1:22:28] brother you that claim to have the Holy

[1:22:33] your brother's life whether it's a
[1:22:36] weaknesses in spiritual life whether
[1:22:39] it's a financial
[1:22:41] situation emotional or
[1:22:43] something don't gossip
[1:22:46] amen be about the father's business pray
[1:22:50] for your brother pray for your
[1:22:53] sister
[1:22:55] don't be listening to the negative
[1:22:56] report that's me I hate listening to the
[1:22:59] negative report this going on in the
[1:23:01] church this no come on you hear
[1:23:04] something either go talk to the brother
[1:23:07] or to the sister
[1:23:09] yes make sure it's the right thing you
[1:23:11] don't have to go report it to somebody
[1:23:16] else as a man of God like brother bam
[1:23:18] when brother Evans they had a issue with
[1:23:22] with the stolen car they came to him
[1:23:25] but B didn't say I have the
[1:23:27] solution the true man of God will take
[1:23:29] you to the Lord amen you bring it to me
[1:23:32] I bring it to the Lord out don't have
[1:23:34] nobody else to whom I'm going to tell no
[1:23:37] I take it to the Lord
[1:23:40] period amen we'll be about the father's
[1:23:43] business amen that's
[1:23:47] right because in this side or on the
[1:23:50] other side of uh new New Birth people
[1:23:54] people will do all kind of
[1:23:55] things and we are living in a critical
[1:23:58] time where if you don't pay attention
[1:24:00] you'll be just church
[1:24:03] member we don't want to be church member
[1:24:06] we want to be the true worshippers amen
[1:24:09] we want to be about the father's
[1:24:12] business we don't want to be uh negative
[1:24:16] report
[1:24:18] listeners we want to be positive all the
[1:24:20] time and that's the gift of the Holy
[1:24:22] Spirit we have to be positive all the
[1:24:26] time because we have the Holy Spirit in
[1:24:28] US
[1:24:29] amen
[1:24:31] amen you see Peter after the New
[1:24:34] Birth he was about the father's business
[1:24:37] right it's not the same Peter before New
[1:24:40] Birth it's not the same Peter before the
[1:24:42] Holy
[1:24:43] Spirit he
[1:24:46] said
[1:24:48] Gold Silver and silver or Silver and
[1:24:51] Gold Have I None such as I have I give
[1:24:56] it to you stand up and walk amen he's
[1:24:59] the one that stood that day of
[1:25:02] Pentecost to tell the people that no
[1:25:04] these people are not drunk as you think
[1:25:05] they
[1:25:06] are why because he was about the
[1:25:09] father's business was not the same Peter
[1:25:12] he was serious because he was about the
[1:25:14] father's business
[1:25:16] amen so we need to question ourselves
[1:25:19] are we about the father's
[1:25:21] business are we taking Ser because this
[1:25:24] the this is a battle friends that's
[1:25:26] right you see something going somebody
[1:25:28] going through some situations it's a
[1:25:30] battle we don't joke cuz it might be it
[1:25:32] might be you what if it was you what you
[1:25:35] going to
[1:25:38] do most of the time we don't realize
[1:25:40] that yes sir it's a battle
[1:25:44] sir and if we are holy spirit filled we
[1:25:48] should be about the father's
[1:25:51] business that's why Christ saw Peter
[1:25:54] when he was talking no I will do this
[1:25:56] I'll do that no no no you're not ready
[1:25:59] yet
[1:26:02] right and when he received the Holy
[1:26:04] Spirit the Lord didn't have to tell him
[1:26:06] he was going
[1:26:07] through
[1:26:09] smoothly why because the holy spirit
[1:26:12] because the father because the spirit
[1:26:15] was in him God's spirit was in him like
[1:26:19] he said I'll put my spirit in you to
[1:26:21] cause you to obey my word yes sir that's
[1:26:24] right
[1:26:25] if you don't have the spirit of God
[1:26:27] you're not going to obey his
[1:26:32] word butam says this in the question and
[1:26:35] answer number
[1:26:37] one Those whom he
[1:26:41] called he justified Those whom he
[1:26:45] justified he
[1:26:47] glorified and every redeemed person in
[1:26:51] the world this morning that's under the
[1:26:54] blood of Jesus Christ filled with the
[1:26:58] Holy Ghost have everlasting life and
[1:27:02] can't
[1:27:03] perish and it is already in Heavenly
[1:27:06] places with Jesus Christ Hallelujah and
[1:27:09] shall never come into condemnation
[1:27:11] already
[1:27:13] redeemed because listen he's Paul is
[1:27:16] talking in the
[1:27:18] past which means it's something that
[1:27:20] happened before the foundation of the
[1:27:22] world have redeemed have called when did
[1:27:26] he call you before the foundation of the
[1:27:28] world
[1:27:29] Amen see already
[1:27:32] redeemed already
[1:27:36] glorified that's lovely amen when you
[1:27:41] leave this earth you have a body already
[1:27:44] waiting for
[1:27:45] you friends we we we have a message that
[1:27:50] is Suess the understanding of humankind
[1:27:54] we don't have to take it uh uh like
[1:27:57] granted we're supposed to go deep in
[1:27:59] this message there's many nuggets that
[1:28:01] we can enjoy
[1:28:02] and because we don't Fellowship
[1:28:06] enough true because some of the things
[1:28:09] we know we got them from fellowship
[1:28:12] right some of the questions you
[1:28:14] have you might have like the pastor
[1:28:16] invited the visiting ministers and they
[1:28:20] just speak on something that you have
[1:28:22] questions long time sure or might be in
[1:28:26] fellowship with brothers or our pastor
[1:28:29] can just come here one day and bring the
[1:28:32] clarification on the things you used to
[1:28:35] have questions all of that it takes it
[1:28:38] behooves us to have uh an awareness amen
[1:28:43] you know to be up to be
[1:28:46] connected you know I remember one day we
[1:28:50] uh it was um Thanksgiving Day last here
[1:28:55] but Joshua kind of uh called The
[1:28:57] Believers to come together I think he T
[1:29:00] to uh brother Ron about it and um we had
[1:29:04] brother Gideon kasonga here so it was
[1:29:06] the time to welcome him and to be
[1:29:09] together and but Joshua KH he was
[1:29:11] inspired to say okay if you have
[1:29:14] something that the Lord has done in your
[1:29:15] life you can give a testimony
[1:29:18] here friends one testimony that touched
[1:29:21] my heart was one of the sister jolia
[1:29:25] I don't know if she's here
[1:29:27] tonight and I told Brother Joshua all
[1:29:29] this Gathering was for this
[1:29:32] testimony she said she her last baby she
[1:29:36] has a baby she said since she gave birth
[1:29:39] to that baby she went through all kind
[1:29:41] of
[1:29:42] stuff they told her your sugar is up and
[1:29:45] this and that and she she was like
[1:29:48] overwhelmed by all kind of problems to
[1:29:50] the point where she was ready to commit
[1:29:52] suicide why because she was alone and
[1:29:55] Bam
[1:29:57] says the lion or the wild animal will
[1:30:00] follow the lamb that being isolated from
[1:30:04] the rest right she was by herself her
[1:30:08] husband may be at
[1:30:09] work something bad could have happened
[1:30:13] she said she was disclosed to take the
[1:30:15] knife and kill the
[1:30:21] baby why because of lack of fellowship
[1:30:25] and I told Brother Joshua we need to
[1:30:27] have Fellowship
[1:30:28] more you know go visit the brother like
[1:30:31] we spend time with Brother
[1:30:34] Ray talk about the Lord and I have
[1:30:37] another uh
[1:30:40] brother but uh NE but Neil I keep
[1:30:46] promising him and he told me he was
[1:30:47] going to call me I'm still waiting for
[1:30:48] the
[1:30:51] call friends we need Fellowship amen we
[1:30:55] need to pray one for another amen the
[1:30:58] time is very critical it's very
[1:31:02] bad the last thing I shared with uh the
[1:31:05] pastor
[1:31:07] Gideon he told me about a group of the
[1:31:09] Believers from his
[1:31:12] church that need to be the tape
[1:31:16] listeners they came to him they said
[1:31:18] okay pastor we think uh we're going to
[1:31:21] be listening to the tapes and and we
[1:31:24] have found a place to rent that we need
[1:31:27] to start fellowshipping over there and
[1:31:29] listening to the
[1:31:30] tapes he said well that's okay I
[1:31:34] understand that I admired him because he
[1:31:37] was very um wise he used wisdom and he
[1:31:41] told them I understand the person you
[1:31:44] don't want to listen to is
[1:31:47] me okay so he's one what what we're
[1:31:50] going to do you paid your ties you paid
[1:31:53] your offer and everything for this
[1:31:54] building to be what it is today so I
[1:31:57] don't want you to go spend the money
[1:31:59] there you can just keep coming you don't
[1:32:01] have to come and listen to me preaching
[1:32:04] you can come here when we don't have
[1:32:06] Services put the tape and listen to the
[1:32:10] tape as a matter of fact I might as well
[1:32:12] come and listen with you together how's
[1:32:17] that you know what happened the majority
[1:32:20] of that group is ah he's wise so they
[1:32:23] didn't know what to do you know what you
[1:32:26] might we might as well just go back you
[1:32:28] see that was a bad influence and you
[1:32:31] have influences like that throughout the
[1:32:34] land that's right you don't know cuz
[1:32:36] some people they need to be
[1:32:37] free in their sinful
[1:32:40] lives and they will influence you in
[1:32:43] something that you don't even know
[1:32:45] nothing
[1:32:46] about so that was wise and then I
[1:32:48] admired him for that amen so the people
[1:32:51] the Believers came back to the church y
[1:32:54] cuz they didn't know what to do he said
[1:32:56] you can come when we don't have services
[1:32:58] like on Thursday you put the tape and I
[1:33:00] can come and listen with
