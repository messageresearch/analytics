When I'm low in spirit, I cried, Lord, lift me up, for I want to climb higher in thee. But he knows I couldn't live on the mountain. So he picked out a valley for me. He leads me beside still waters. somewhere in the valley below. And he draws me aside to be tested. Oh, and tried, but in the valley he restoreth my soul. When it's dark as a dungeon and the sun set them shines and I question, Lord, why must this be? And he tells me there's strength in my weakness and there's victory ahead for me.

I believe saints of God that something is happening &gt;&gt; and I want you all to be extremely conscientious of what I'm going to preach this morning. &gt;&gt; I believe it's a game changer. I believe that it will do something for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't normally say those things, but just letting you know that I've been very, very deeply moved in the last couple weeks. Deeply more so than I have, I want to say in years. my personal time with God, &gt;&gt; my devotions with my wife of sitting down and going over some things, trials in my life, and yet I know that God's got it all in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, God bless you all this morning. Let's just remain standing as we turn in our Bibles. I'd like you to turn with me. Thank you musicians. Brother Chris, thank you for that song special each and every one. And listen, while you're turning to Ephesians chapter 3, I'm going to make an announcement here right now um that I am embarking on a u a new study series, the seven church ages. And we are going to start this coming Friday. Somebody say Friday. &gt;&gt; Friday. &gt;&gt; Friday. here at the church 7:30. Um this is Friday the 23rd. Bring your seven church age book. If you don't have one, well then we've got some copies of others here. Uh and if you don't have them, and we need to order some, we're going to do it, but we're going to start uh on this Friday, but I'm probably going to do it on Sunday evenings. Sunday evenings every other Sunday for a while. Now, this is just optional, but I want to say to as many of my young people, I would love to see you there to to kind of get an idea a little bit of the history of what God has done, but not only to see what God has done, because when you see what God has done, you will know what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because as it was, &gt;&gt; so shall it be. So we understand those things. So I'm excited. I tell you what, my wife and I, I think, are on page like 143 right now in the seven church age book and every paragraph. &gt;&gt; Oh my, you just as well highlight and underline the whole thing. &gt;&gt; It's just like your Bible. You read it before, but man, why didn't I see that before? It's cuz we're coming into a season. &gt;&gt; All of you understand something. And listen very carefully. &gt;&gt; We're coming into the season where this is going to affect you and it's going to change you. You're being changed right now. &gt;&gt; Every one of you that have received this message, &gt;&gt; God did it for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. The end result &gt;&gt; is rapture. &gt;&gt; So he sent you a voice. &gt;&gt; He sent you a messenger &gt;&gt; to make you aware of the time and the season. This is an end time seed sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I just let you know the wife and I and my daughter happened to be there. She had spent the night and uh and uh we had our devotions uh that morning. We were reading our Bible and each one would take a read a few verses and then we got done doing that and then we uh went to the seven church age book and everything and wow there's something just opened up to me that I tell you this what I'm speaking on today is going to launch out in multitudes of directions. So, I'm not going to overwhelm you with all that God has been dealing with me right now in one service because you can't do it. &gt;&gt; You just can't do it. And so, we know that God is doing something right now. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says something is fixing to happen. &gt;&gt; And I believe we need to be acutely aware. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of what's going on. Ephesians chapter 3. Ephesians chapter 3. Amen. Brother Johnny Green. It's good to have you and your daughter here. God bless you richly. Amen. Ephesians chapter 3. for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles. So now he's telling us here's a cause and effect. &gt;&gt; Brother Dave Mabel it's because in that day &gt;&gt; the Lord's day you'll begin to &gt;&gt; see something that you never saw before. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the Apostle Paul who the disciples said he's hard to be understood &gt;&gt; if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward. how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote of four and few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit prophets speak it, apostles teach it, God reveals it. &gt;&gt; God alone is the revealer of his &gt;&gt; word. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "The Holy Ghost is the divine revealer of God's word." Amen. &gt;&gt; That the Gentiles should be fellow hes and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel. Whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. Unto me who am least less than the least of all saints. Is this grace given that I might preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ? than to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom &gt;&gt; of God. Wow. &gt;&gt; What an inheritance. &gt;&gt; That you might know. &gt;&gt; S Marge, God bless you. I looked I I They said you were here. I looked for somebody waving a little white flag. There he was. That you might know the manifold. &gt;&gt; Not unfold. Manifold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Multiple. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God's changing. &gt;&gt; He's unfolding. &gt;&gt; The dimensions of heaven &gt;&gt; are inner penetrating. &gt;&gt; Into this realm, &gt;&gt; and you you have to understand why all of this is happening. &gt;&gt; It's happening for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence &gt;&gt; by the faith of him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. &gt;&gt; That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit on the inner man &gt;&gt; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height. This was very much quickened to me this verse that God is changing his dimension and trying to take your understanding and make it multi-dimensional. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just on one plane, &gt;&gt; not carnal, &gt;&gt; but spiritual &gt;&gt; and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceedingly ab abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. &gt;&gt; It's a power. It's working in you. &gt;&gt; And God is determined &gt;&gt; to save you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't you saving yourself. This isn't you keeping the commandments. This isn't &gt;&gt; about you. &gt;&gt; It's about him. &gt;&gt; It's about a covenant that he made with our father Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Help me this morning, Lord. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. Verse 18 again may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height. Turn with me one last scripture. Romans 8. Then I'll have you to be seated. Romans chapter 8 verses 35 through 39. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword all kinds of issues. &gt;&gt; But he's asking the question, who shall separate you? In what situation &gt;&gt; is God not in control of? As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. &gt;&gt; For I am persuaded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I too &gt;&gt; will say yay and amen to that scripture. I'm persuaded also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How about you? Amen. &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; persuaded &gt;&gt; that neither death, &gt;&gt; nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless the reading of his word this morning. You may be seated. I want to title my sermon this morning, Faith Changes Your Dimensional Understanding About God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith changes your dimensional thinking or your understanding about God. And I want to take a subject of we are changing dimensions. &gt;&gt; It is happening. &gt;&gt; It's going on right now. You may not see it. You not may not be fully aware of it, but you're being changed from mortal to immortality. &gt;&gt; How is God doing it? By the revealing of his word to you personally. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say that I have been personally profoundly affected in the last couple of weeks. And I wish to share with you a little bit of what God has been dealing with me on. I believe that brother Brennham tells us that you pastors get into that word, you partake of it and then break it down and give it to your people. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um I have been studying and once I broke into this realm, I wanted to see what does brother Brennham say about it. &gt;&gt; What does brother Brennham say about another dimension? All right. &gt;&gt; He actually, if you put in quotation marks, type in another dimension, he he speaks about it 84 times, &gt;&gt; saying, "I live most of the time in another dimension." Brother Billy Paul told me as we traveled together, he said, "Daddy, on the last couple months of his life," he said, "Billy," he said, "the revelations are coming so strong and so vivid that I can't tell the reality." is this vision or the reality. That's how real &gt;&gt; it is. &gt;&gt; I want all of you to understand that vision or revelation is actually sight. &gt;&gt; You begin to see something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You begin to understand something. You begin to catch something that you didn't before. &gt;&gt; And because of you're catching that, &gt;&gt; it's changing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so the prophet mentions another dimension 84 times. I'm not going to read you every quote. I think all of you should go and type that in and look at it. It will astound you. But I just pulling up just a few of these to let you show what he said about this other dimension in believing thou this in 1951. My ministry is praying for the sick. And in order to do that, I must come into another world that people know nothing about. There's just no need of trying to explain it. You can't do it. I go to fasting about three days before my service and it lifts me up into a sphere there. Well, that's just it. It goes into another dimension that sees things and so forth. Then he says, "Between services, I go and relax my spirit, go hunting or fishing. In the testimony of Jesus Christ in 1953, he says there is another dimension that many people know little of but God lives in that place. &gt;&gt; Are you interested &gt;&gt; in that dimension? Because that's where God lives. &gt;&gt; He said, "But very few people know anything about it. Now in order to understand this dimension I want all of you to understand it just doesn't happen by chance even as coming to church if you're not seeking God if you're not praying if you're not quieting your spirit in coming here and saying God give me something you will sit right there in your chair and not be fed and not get anything. my brother. &gt;&gt; While others around you may be feasting and enjoying the revealed word, but you're sitting there going, "Why am I not?" So look at yourself first. Judge yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I prepared? Am I ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say get ready. &gt;&gt; I SAY PRAY. &gt;&gt; PRAY MUCH. PRAY BEFORE YOU GET HERE. &gt;&gt; Don't do the last minute. Okay, Lord, hurry up and bless me. So, the testimony of Jesus Christ, that's in another dimension many people know little of, but God lives in that place. And the only thing you have to do is to not think about your senses, how you feel. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; Quit going off of feelings. &gt;&gt; Watch what he says. Just believe what he said for the scripture cannot be broken. Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe you receive it. Present tense, it will be given to you. Future tense. St. Mark 11:24. Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; He cannot heal. We can only declare. We cannot heal. We can only declare that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead. He healed you when he died. &gt;&gt; He rose again for your justification. And when you believe on him, you're justified in the sight of God. Then we believe he is risen from the dead. His atonement was for every one of you. Every person, every sick person was healed when Jesus put it at the deposit at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. your faith that you have and every one of you I want all of you to know there is none of you that are a seed gene of GOD BUT WHAT GOD has given every one of you a measure of faith &gt;&gt; but it's up to you what you do with it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; do you nurture it. &gt;&gt; Do you seek it? &gt;&gt; Do you get into it? You do. You feed your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't just sit back and haphazardly say, "Well, if I'm predestinated, I'll get it and therefore just sit back and do nothing." No, you got to seek. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you shall find. &gt;&gt; You got to ask. See, there is a responsibility placed upon you. AND I AS YOUR PASTOR, I'M PUTTING A responsibility on each one of you. Seek and YOU SHALL FIND. ASK, IT SHALL BE GIVEN. &gt;&gt; KNOCK, THE DOOR SHALL BE OPEN. &gt;&gt; That's his word. But you got a responsibility. If you don't do it, you ain't going to receive. &gt;&gt; You'll then be foolish. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now your faith that you have, it is a gift of God. For by grace are you saved through faith. &gt;&gt; Faith is the vehicle that takes you to salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is not of works. None of you can earn it. It was given to you by gracemen, &gt;&gt; lest any man should boast. &gt;&gt; I can promise you and assure you that when we get to heaven, none of you are going to walk through those pearly gates and you're going to say, "Aha, I have arrived. I did it. I accomplished it. I kept the faith. I I earned my way. Now, where's my mansion &gt;&gt; walking in there? I tell you, we will all bow our heads. &gt;&gt; We will all humb be so humbled. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It was by your grace I've made it. &gt;&gt; So, it's listen to me now. It's not the messenger &gt;&gt; preaching his message that quickens your gift. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say because you're seed, &gt;&gt; you have an ability to pull. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason that the prophet had a message to preach was because you were demanding it. You were pulling it. &gt;&gt; Now just hold this thought. Now &gt;&gt; it was faith being energized by the elect seed within each one of you. It's faith or Holy Ghost revelation that calls the bride to come out of foolish things. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith which is given as a gift from God to you. It was given to you when you kept all the word and was perfect in all your ways. &gt;&gt; He gave it to you before the foundation of the world. In fact, gifts and callings &gt;&gt; are without repentance. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's faith operating God's gift giving you the ability then to hear what the spirit is saying. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brennham in 1955 begins to show you how faith operates. He says, "Now your faith pulls from the gift of God just like it was the great gift of God." And this gift here is just a small amateur gift, but it's of God just the same. He's talking about this gift that he had been given. So your faith operates it. &gt;&gt; Not mine. Yours is the one who does it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Jesus's faith that healed the woman. He said, "Thy faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thy faith has saved thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thy faith did it. Her faith operated the gift of God that was in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, as I've been declaring unto you for the past couple of weeks, as I had been listening to the uniting time and sign. The prophet said that uh a prophet when he sent to a generation is a sign. &gt;&gt; It's a declaration. &gt;&gt; God does it for a purpose. In fact, brother Brennham uses the terminology, it's the end time seed sign. &gt;&gt; Now, a sign precedes an event. Signs are never put after the fact. Dip in the road. They don't do it after you hit the dip. &gt;&gt; It's always preceding. So, a sign precedes something. I looked up Webster and Webster said a sign is a a gesture communicating a command, a wish or a thought. We can think of sign language and many of us know simple signs. Okay? Right? &gt;&gt; We see certain signs and they declare something. &gt;&gt; And so it is also Webster says is a symbol declaring that something is about to happen. It is also a public announcement or a public display for an advertisement. We see along the road everywhere advertisement this sign uh you got to buy this get this truck come to this restaurant signs everywhere sign you to stop they get your attention oh hamburger I need a hamburger oh I need a new car it's telling you so there's a purpose they want to get your purpose to stop and buy and consume whatever A sign is also for giving direction or warning. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, a prophet is given and it's strategically placed before the event. &gt;&gt; So, a prophet is a specifically gifted man who has the ability to see into another dimension. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, brother Brennham said, "Most of the time, I'm living in another dimension." &gt;&gt; The men that traveled with brother Brennham were very much aware of that. He said, "Brethren," he says, "I live in another dimension." He said, "It just makes me nervous." He said, he told Brother Perry Green, and driving down the road, he asked him, he said, "Um, can you tell me a joke?" And brother Perry thought, "Well, maybe he'll rebuke me because I've been known to tell too many jokes." Told him a joke. He laughed, said, "Tell me another one." And so on until he told several jokes. And he said, "You're probably wondering why I'm asking you to tell me a a joke." He said, "Because laughter is as a good medicine." Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "Laughter is what causes me to relax my spirit and I come down out of that realm." &gt;&gt; He says, "Because as an example," he said, "See this house we're passing right here? There's a man inside that home. He's dying of cancer. See the car that is passing us?" He said, "They're going to have an accident just down the road." He began now to be totally aware and sensitive of things that are happening around him. And I want to say that when the gift operates or is activated with the prophet, time means nothing. &gt;&gt; Forward, backward. He can go into the past as well as into the future. &gt;&gt; During the prayer line, while he is discerning the hearts, he actually understand this now. He becomes a window, a channel by which people can see into another dimension. He says, "Come close." He said, "Now, that that won't hurt you. That's just him." Now they're coming for whatever purpose, for whatever issue they're having in their life. He says, now are we strangers one to another? Yes, we are. I've never met you. Is that true? How much of the time does he just visit with them? He said, now if God would show me what your problem is, would you believe? You would. Okay. If you'll take God at his word, he'll take you at your word. Do you believe me? To be God's prophet. Now, what is he what's he doing? He's he's catching their spirit. &gt;&gt; Because now he's going to become a window. He's going to be a channel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be God's prophet? &gt;&gt; You do? I I see. Oh, he goes back into time. He begins to declare something and he says, "Most of the time I have no idea what I'm saying. I'm just a voice." &gt;&gt; Now, what is he doing? He's a window. &gt;&gt; For those believers to see that first off, GOD UNDERSTANDS WHERE YOU'RE AT and what you're going through BECAUSE HE'S A HIGH PRIEST THAT CAN BE TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF YOUR INFIRMITIES. BUT TOO MUCH OF THE TIME we tend to be so narcissistic in OUR VIEWPOINT TOWARDS GOD IS EVEN GOD DOESN'T UNDERSTAND what I'm going through. &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be God's prophet? Oh, you do. If God would show me, would you believe? Oh, you would. So now he's this window. He's this channel that God is using. &gt;&gt; And many of them whether it was financial, physical, whether they're shadowed unto death. Brother Brenham says many of the time, hey, I see it's a dark shadow or I see there's a lie that's told against you. On and on so many situation. I see your husband. I see your children. I see you in a doctor's office. He goes on and on. There's so many multitudes of things because within the body of Christ are many needs &gt;&gt; and too much of the time we are not aware that God is mindful of where you're at. &gt;&gt; He said I'll be with you even in you until &gt;&gt; the end of the world. So you know sometimes well you don't understand you know this is a life and death situation. and this, you know, well, I want all of you I I began to study this the other day and I found it quite interesting. Brother Brandham said, we're all dying. He says, you know what he said, man is given a a period of time 60 three score in 10 years, 70 years. That's if you're good to your parents. Okay. So he says, "So you're given this amount of time and he says that some of you God will allow you to go through certain things." He said, "But actually after you are older than 21," he said, "you start dying." &gt;&gt; Anyone here over 21? &gt;&gt; If you're over 21, guess what? You're dying. Now, how soon you're going to go off the scene, I don't know. Some of you may be in a car wreck, plane wreck. You may drown. You may be hit by a car going across the street. And a lot of us think we're going to live forever in this mortal realm. Let me tell you, our days are numbered. So what you do from your birth until that time, okay, depends on how you're going to look at at God's will for your life. &gt;&gt; God understands what you're going through. &gt;&gt; He knows the situation you're in. And if you'll be mindful, &gt;&gt; then there's deliverance. Job when he was in the belly of the whale, he said, "If I look at these lying vanities, I forsake my own deliverance." Now, I'll tell you what, of all the situations within scripture, that's the most claustrophobic stinking. I wouldn't have wanted to been swallowed by a whale. This is not Walt Disney with floating on a little raft inside and got a a candle and it's lit and you can see what's going on. No, he's wrapped in seaweed swallowed and gastric acids are starting to eat him and it stinks and whoa, how did I get here? And and he says, "THIS IS LYING VANITIES." WHAT WAS TELLING HIM THAT'S LYING VANITIES? THERE WAS SOMETHING HE SAID, "IF I WILL TURN MY FACE TOWARDS THE HOLY CITY, GOD WILL HEAR." LET ME TELL YOU, YOU JUST TURN ONE TIME. YOU JUST ASK GOD &gt;&gt; AND WATCH HIM COME ON THE SCENE. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, YOU'LL DIE IN YOUR &gt;&gt; LYING VANITY. &gt;&gt; I SAY LOOK UNTO GOD. HAVE FAITH IN GOD. &gt;&gt; Turned his face towards a holy city. And guess what? It was all in God's purpose. God took him and had him. He was supposed to go to Nineveh. &gt;&gt; But he went to Tarsus. How many of you said, "Well, Tarsus seems a whole lot easier road than Nineveh because I don't want to go there. I don't want to have to preach to those people and tell them to repent." So anyway, God swallows him up, takes a personal taxi, three-day, puts him up onto the beach, and and guess what? Nineveh worshiped the whale. &gt;&gt; And so out of the mouth of God, imagine here comes this big huge whale and he beats himself, his lower jaw, and out of the here vomits. Out of the mouth of God comes a prophet. He stands up. He cle clears the seaweed. He goes like this. Where am I? They say Nineveh repent. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, they repented with sackcloth and ashes even on their animals. &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; All things will work together for the good to them that love God. DID NOT SAY they were God good, &gt;&gt; but he will use it for his good. Quit trying to ask why. Why me? Why this? WHY THAT TRIAL? WHY? HEY, THINK IT NOT STRANGE AS THOUGH THESE FIERY TRIALS. OH, WHY did I deserve this? For what reason? Oh, I know why you're sick. Because you're mama, DAD. BECAUSE YOU did this. BECAUSE A STOP. THE DEVIL IS AN ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN. SOME OF YOU GET SICK ONLY FOR THE GLORY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Come on, BROTHER. PREACH. BECAUSE GOD WANTS TO SHOW YOU HE'S JEHOVAH &gt;&gt; RA. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, so your faith, your faith that God gives you, it's a gift operates this messenger. That's why even when you listen to a tape &gt;&gt; and here it is after the fact and you're sitting there and he might have preached this in 1963 and he's preaching and it's so current. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You feel like man this this is me. This is my situation. God is speaking to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; I began to look what the Apostle Paul said in the breadth and the length and the height. I I thought, well, wow, this is this is not onedimensional. Amen. &gt;&gt; Too much too much of the time, you and I as Christians live in a one-dimensional realm. &gt;&gt; And it's hard for us to comprehend of this that's going on around us. But how can this great apostle declare to the elect of that day to get out of carnal and intellectual thinking? Because I want you to come to the very knowledge of God himself. &gt;&gt; And what does the apostle mean by the breadth, the length, the depth and height of the love of God? Because our imagination CAN JUST BARELY GRASP that in its entirety. &gt;&gt; OUR LITTLE FINITE MINDS are just exactly that, finite. But God is infinite &gt;&gt; and all of you need to have an upgrade from God. And that is to give you revelation so you can come out of your finite thinking and start thinking about infinite things. Quit sitting so much of the time in your little realm. &gt;&gt; I want you to change dimensions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you while I'm preaching well actually all of a sudden something is being said. You will be jettisoned invisible &gt;&gt; to those around you. But you know you've been caught up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL GO WOW &gt;&gt; that so quickened me. &gt;&gt; What were you doing? changing dimensions. Didn't even know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were catching revelation from your heavenly father and upon this rock I'll build my church. &gt;&gt; So how is it that we could catch this breadth and length? And I looked at each one of these. So, let me for just a moment kind of expound on the breadth and the length and these other two dimensions. Again, they're dimensions. And while my wife and my daughter and I were reading this very scripture, it was so quicken to me. I said, "Wow, the Apostle Paul is making God multi-dimensional. Let's look at the breath. That's a dimension. it the breath that understand is this supernatural girdle that wraps the seed gene of God in its elective love. How can you understand that? That God before the foundation of the world loved you and put a ring on your finger and that wow that that that's pretty big, is it not? &gt;&gt; Or the length It reaches from the eternal purpose and mission of Christ himself, bringing it all the way from the conception in the mind of God to a PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION HERE ON EARTH. &gt;&gt; BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. &gt;&gt; IT TAKES YOU to eternity. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW LONG IS THIS THEN? YEAH. &gt;&gt; From eternity to eternity &gt;&gt; to infinity &gt;&gt; and beyond. &gt;&gt; You talk about length. &gt;&gt; It keeps unfolding. &gt;&gt; It reaches all the way from infinity back to infinity. NO WONDER CHRIST COULD SAY, "I came from God." &gt;&gt; And I go back to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's depth all the way down to the lowest fallen estate of Adam and his seed after him. &gt;&gt; Goes to the very lowest of hell. David said, "Though I make my bed in hell, Thou art with me. &gt;&gt; Talk. And you say, "Well, I'm so down. I'm so depressed." You can't get down far enough that God can't outreach you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO GET OUT OF YOUR little one dimensional mind about here right now and me and woe is me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. to start thinking about this depth of God. &gt;&gt; He'll go to any measure &gt;&gt; to get you. &gt;&gt; And he reaches from the highest mountain &gt;&gt; and he goes to the lowest hell. Let it go beyond the song. &gt;&gt; Let it become a reality. &gt;&gt; I know the pit the the pit from whence I was dug. How many of you can say, "God, HE REACHED WAY DOWN FOR ME." &gt;&gt; WAY DOWN. &gt;&gt; OH, WAY DOWN. NO MATTER WHAT I DID, NO MATTER HOW BAD I GOT, NO MATTER HOW FAR INTO HELL I BECAME, PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD REACHED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WAY DOWN FOR ME. &gt;&gt; What amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THAT'S TRUE. WHAT A SAVIOR. &gt;&gt; WHAT A MIGHTY GOD I SERVE. &gt;&gt; And the height. &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY THE DEPTH, BUT THE HEIGHT. &gt;&gt; That he would take you into &gt;&gt; the heaven of heavens. Yes, &gt;&gt; there were men in scriptures Paul said there was a man who was caught up into the seventh heaven whether in body or out of body I don't know dimensional change I want you to understand saints of God there are even dimensions in heaven &gt;&gt; he said the bride and only the bride that electing of God that's got the holy Holy Ghost that comes to the place of adoption will live in that new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; The rest foolish virgin &gt;&gt; and all of the rest that have eternal life &gt;&gt; but they're not bride &gt;&gt; are going to be outside the city. But that elect lady. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that the height of this love of God is taking the elect from the lowest hell to the highest height of heaven itself. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to the eternal glories of God. Now, yesterday while I was studying yesterday morning, Brother Tom Weathers from Flagstaff, one of the brothers that we brought to the message years ago, a bunch of us, we stopped and visited with him and shared with him about the message. Well, anyway, he called me up. He said, "Brother Ron, I I just was down. I had the they they had a men's breakfast over there at Phoenix Tabernacle and different ones." And he he he said, you know, and I've been involved with Harmony in the Desert and so on and so forth. So he said I was there, but he said, "It would be a shame, Brother Ron, that I'm in your backyard and I at least don't call you." Well, Brother Tom, because this is always Brother Tom. Hi, Brother Ron. This is Brother Tom. Hi, Brother Tom. Anyway, we just get to visit and he said, "Brother Ron, I'm just praying that God will give you something extra special, something supernatural tomorrow to share with you." I'm paraphrasing &gt;&gt; to share with your sheep that God has got you over. I said, "Well, I I said, you know what? I want to talk about dis I I I want to talk about dimensional change. and how that we're changing dimension. He said, "Wow, it's interesting you said that." Now, don't use my name or a footnote in your sermon. Sorry, Tom, but it's okay. He says, "But he said, uh, I just learned something about what's called spatial awareness." Any of you a master of spatial awareness? Do you even know what it is? So I said, 'What is spatial awareness? He says, it is the ability to understand and recognize what's going on around you. &gt;&gt; Now, most of you are like Mr. Mcoo. Oh, and everything's going AND YOU GOT NO IDEA OF ALL that's going on around you and you're not aware that sometimes you're visited by angels unaware. You're encompassed BY SUCH A CLOUD OF WITNESSES &gt;&gt; THAT GOD is supernaturally visiting with you and you're just bbing &gt;&gt; and you've got no spatial awareness. You're not cognizant of what's going on around you. So he shared with me he said babies he says medical doctors tell us babies are not born with spa spatial awareness he says let me give you an idea of this he said babies when they're born their cerebral cortex you nurses listen carefully he says their cerebral cortex effect is not developed. It only recognizes see, taste, smell, feel, and hear. And they have no idea of spatial awareness. So you tell a little baby, "Mommy is not here. She's in the other room." That little baby keeps crying because mommy is not here. Another room. I don't know. Another room. I want mommy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Mommy is coming in 45 minutes. And baby sits here and go, "Okay, thank you for telling me. I will time it." NO. BABY GOES, "I HAVE NO IDEA. 45 MINUTES, MAMA." NO. &gt;&gt; NO SPATIAL AWARENESS. SO THE cerebral cortex of a baby doesn't really recognize its surroundings. IT'S ONLY SUBJECT TO FIVE PHYSICAL SENSES. And he and then brother Tom said, "But the the doctors tell us that the cerebral cortex begins to develop with age." &gt;&gt; Now, I'm hoping I'm talking to some of you that have come to full age. Okay. That your understanding that you just don't sit there and have no spatial awareness that you that your cerebral cortex WOULD NEVER BE MOVED ON BY FAITH AND YOU GO BEYOND THESE FIVE SENSES THAT YOU SIT IN YOUR EMBRYIONIC FORM. IT'S ME AND ALL ABOUT ME AND WOE IS ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's like the guy that, you know, he prayed, I think it was a flood or a storm and, you know, he sat on his roof and he's going to die and oh God, don't you love me? Send me a, you know, somebody to rescue me. Long comes a guy with a boat. Hey, hey, I come to rescue people. That's okay. I ask God, lets him go. And several things like this. You all know the story. Finally, the waters get so high. He has shunned everyone that was sent to him to get him out of his circumstance. But he said, "No, God. God's going to do it." Some of you are so unaware in your spatial &gt;&gt; true &gt;&gt; deadness &gt;&gt; that God sends people. Somebody calls you on the phone. Somebody talks to you, &gt;&gt; somebody preaches to you a sermon, somebody sings you a song, somebody does something Huh? And you're so aware, well, God, God's going to deliver me. And finally, the guy drowns. &gt;&gt; Gets up in heaven and he says, "But God, I was so waiting on you. You were, you know, I had faith in you." And he said, "I sent you several deliverers and you refused them. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of you &gt;&gt; God has done exactly the same thing. You're praying for your dilemma, your, you know, this, and you're WAITING FOR GOD. GOD SENDS SOME SEVERAL THINGS BY YOU, but you're so narcissistic in your viewpoint. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, the reason of our lack of understanding is because of spatial awareness. &gt;&gt; You got to grow up. You got to mature. &gt;&gt; So, show me this in scripture. You want to see it in scriptures? Because babies do not understand. They have no spatial awareness. Okay. 1 Corinthians 13:es 9-12. For we know in part G. Huh? We know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect come, then that which is in part shall be done away with. When I was a child, &gt;&gt; I understood everything. No, I thought as a child, I spake as a child. Understood as a child, I thought as a child. But when I became a man, that means maturity. &gt;&gt; Cerebral cortexing. &gt;&gt; I start thinking, &gt;&gt; I START HAVING SPATIAL awareness because my maturity level has me to UNDERSTAND THAT I'M NOT SUBJECT JUST TO THIS SPATIAL REALM around me. &gt;&gt; Oh, BUT WE'RE SURROUNDED. WE'RE GOING TO DIE. OH, GOD. OPEN THE EYES of my servant to let him see spatial awareness. There's more of us than there is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hope her mother died. Or was it me? I forget. Mother died and she was so distraught and just so discouraged. Oh, mama's so far away. No, she's not. She's right here &gt;&gt; in another &gt;&gt; dimension. &gt;&gt; He said that other dimension's just faster. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that revelation then is changing your dimension from this slow carnal thinking? Because carnal thinking is emnity with God. NEITHER CAN IT UNDERSTAND GOD. SO GOD THEN GIVES YOU AN UPGRADE. You young boys listen to me. &gt;&gt; YOU TRY TO UNDERSTAND this message with an intellectual carnal understanding. You're just going to see rules and regulations and you miss it. Your little spatial &gt;&gt; you need your cerebral cortex to grow up. Come on. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're going to just sit there and Well, the reason I go to church because mom and dad, &gt;&gt; the reason I'm here because when I turn 18, and you know what's so funny? So many of you, well, I can't wait. When I get out of the house, I'm going to be my own boss. Yeah. You're going to have your own house payment or you're going to pay your own rent. You're going to pay your own gas. You're going to do your own laundry. You're going to Yeah. I I just want to be free. I'll tell you what, some of you need a little bit of a freedom. All right, big guy. You're on your own. Don't do that to me. I need gas money this week. Huh? I I'm short. Mom, Dad, will you You're MY OFFSPRING NOW. SPRING ON. YOU GOT TO GROW UP. GOT TO QUIT THINKING. WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I SPAKE. I understood. I acted LIKE A CHILD. QUIT ACTING CHILDISH. &gt;&gt; QUIT ACTING FOOLISH. &gt;&gt; Become a man. &gt;&gt; For now, we see through a glass. Watch this. We see through a glass darkly. &gt;&gt; In other words, I can't hardly see it. &gt;&gt; But then face to face. Now I know in part, &gt;&gt; but then I shall know even as I am known. &gt;&gt; So a greater understanding, a higher dimension than this little realm, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Of you. Everything centers around you. I hope that you parents do not make your child the center of the universe. &gt;&gt; It's not all about them. &gt;&gt; And it's okay that they suffer once in a while. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. If they bang up their car, you fix it, buddy. &gt;&gt; It's your car. You did it. Yeah. Well, I parked it too close. Yeah. And somebody else b fix it. Do you understand what you do? Parents don't parent too well. &gt;&gt; In other words, let them suffer a little bit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let them understand the value of a dollar. If you keep bailing them out, &gt;&gt; then they will have this welfare mentality their whole life. EVERYBODY OWES ME SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, THE BOSS, HE DOESN'T LIKE ME AND I DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH AND I WISH I HAD A JOB AND I I WANT TO BE THE MANAGER OF THIS PLACE. OH, &gt;&gt; if you're going to start on the job, you start at the bottom and you work your way up. It's called apprenticeship. &gt;&gt; You don't become a journeyman overnight. &gt;&gt; Start at the bottom and usually with a broom. This ain't I want to be electrician. You just got me cleaning up. It's so funny how young kids come onto the job with dad and dad's a plumber, electrician, a carpenter, and said, "Yeah, when I was a little kid, I I you know, I learned plumbing from my dad." Oh, you did? How much plumbing did you do? Well, I carried the PVC pipe. I carried the basket of the joints because I don't know a 60deree elbow from a 45 degree elbow. I don't &gt;&gt; Oh, man. I used to help help dad my kids. Yeah. I used to help my dad on the job. We framing. Yeah, I know all about framing. When did they ever frame with daddy? You know what I did? I had him clean up. go clean up all the, you know, 2x4 ends and 2 by six's and everything like that. Yeah, we helped dad frame. You never did framed at all. You understand? But we have a tendency because we were there when daddy was doing it. We thought we were doing it. Okay. We are so limited because of our carnal minds. So we're limited in our ability to go beyond our five &gt;&gt; physical senses. &gt;&gt; So the prophet of God is that window is that channel that God allows you to see into that other realm. Now brother Brandham likens his gift. He said now he said we come to a fence and on the other side of the fence is a circus and he said and there's only one little knot hole in the fence and everybody can't look through the knot hole at the same time. So he says would you lift me up and he says there with my gift I pull you up and I you look over the fence and you go yeah I see hey don't let me down come on hey. So he says, "So what I do is I lift you up." &gt;&gt; Do you understand that while he's preaching, &gt;&gt; he's getting so weak cuz he's Do you see it? &gt;&gt; Do you see it? I'm I'm a window. CAN CAN YOU SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? I HOPE YOU'RE CATCHING IT. &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S HE'S lifting you up &gt;&gt; now. Isn't it a lot easier in church age? Let me move on. I I I know that I'm a wee bit scattered from here and there. And like I said, there's so much that I have on my heart. I realize I cannot say it all in one service. I will not attempt to. So loud easy in church age. Watch this. Now he is the true witness. Now this word true is the same word we saw back there in Revelation 3 and7. You recall that it does not mean true as in contrast to false. It has a richer deeper meaning by far. It expresses perfect realization in contrast to partial realization. &gt;&gt; Now back in Philadelphia age the coming of Lords was drawing nigh. What great love that age manifested for him. It reminds me of those beautiful words in 1 Peter 1:8. Whom having not seen we love and whom we uh though now you see him not yet believing we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. And then them we re with them we rejoice also. We haven't seen him but we felt him. We know him now as much as our limiting senses can let us. &gt;&gt; As much as our limiting senses will let us. But one day it will be face to face. &gt;&gt; That's for this age. He is coming at the end of this age. Partial realization will be made perfect realization complete realization. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have been looking through a glass darkly, but soon it'll be face to face. &gt;&gt; We've been going from glory to glory, but soon it'll be right in &gt;&gt; the glory and his glory will shine. We shall be like him and wondrously like him. Jesus, our savior divine. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; We are complete in him. That's true. &gt;&gt; He would not lie to us about that. But one day we will be changed in these atoms. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; What a time that's going to be. &gt;&gt; Right now, you have the earnest of your inheritance. And you don't get the fullness of your inheritance until the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He just gives you the earnest. You're not changed completely. In fact, you got a battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got a battle going on. And your little spatial awareness is so limited that God has to keep giving you revelation. Hey, hey, don't look at the situations. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the issues that are around you because if you do, you forsake your own &gt;&gt; deliverance. &gt;&gt; Come on, open your eyes. &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart. Lord, &gt;&gt; I want to see you. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul love all he goes and he finds all of these quotes and he sends them. How many of you are on his little email list? &gt;&gt; Yeah, man. I tell you what, this guy gets into good stuff. &gt;&gt; Good stuff. He says, "Do you know what, brother Ron? This message woke up a bride." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's a woke generation. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That's us. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, THIS MESSAGE HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT UPON YOU. IT WOKE YOU UP. IT MADE YOU &gt;&gt; COME TO A MATURITY LEVEL. AMEN. THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOUR OWN LITTLE WORLD, ABOUT YOUR LITTLE career and about how much MONEY YOU MAKE AND WHAT HOUSE YOU LIVE IN. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF THAT &gt;&gt; AND LOOK AND UNDERSTAND, SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; YES, I want all of you to do well. I want you to NOT HAVE TO SUFFER too much, &gt;&gt; but he said in suffering you're going to learn. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; pain is a real motivator. You know that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Suffering's a motivator, too. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you create your own suffering. Oh, I tell you what, I don't like living in the city. I WISH I HAD ME ACORAGE OUT IN WAY OUT IN THE BOONIES somewhere and had a little 10 acres of land and little oh white picket fence so my kids could go play outside and everything and yeah I just yeah get out of your little limited cerebral cortex &gt;&gt; and realize hey that your contentment &gt;&gt; is not on because you know what yeah give me a home way out in the boom ies and give me a car that will be able to drive me over that dirt road. Give me enough money that I only have to go to work one one day a week. And I pray that THIS REALLY GOOD JOB THAT EARNS me money is only a few miles from my boondock house. You're on some kind of pipe dream. So, you go and get a house. And guess what? You got a mortgage. You got a wife. You love her. She has kids. Kids come along. What a responsibility. &gt;&gt; It was It was pretty easy when it was just two mouths to feed, huh? And you was king of the hill, man. You came home, the wife gave you all the attention. Hey, come rub my neck. Hey, come over here. Oh, hey, let's go out to dinner tonight. It all changes after them kids arrive. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And guess what? You ain't king of the hill anymore, honey. You know you want a little attention. the kids. I gotta feed the kids. Well, feed them before I get home. I'm I'm Tarzan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You in what fairy tale? You find out, hey, you got kids. You got to take care of the kids. You got to feed them. I took a brother. I let a a brother his kids came with us one time to to go out to eat. So there was three of the kids and they came with us and I said, "Hey," I says, "You guys can order whatever you want." Really? Really? Our daddy makes us share a happy meal. I said, "No." Hey, I said order anything you want. Anything up to $3. And you're all of you understand that as you grow and you mature, great are your responsibilities. &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to get married, you want to have a nice house, you want to drive a nice car, huh? Yeah. Of course. Of course. And and we all like nice things. It's true. But if you're not careful, you bite off more than you can chew. &gt;&gt; And then you're you're woe is me. Oh, I work 14 hours a day and I just go to work Monday through Friday and Saturday I have to fix the house. Oh, come on. And Sunday, Sunday, I got to go to church. &gt;&gt; Do you see? And then pretty soon, oh man, I just wish things would change. I wish I could just go fishing for a living. Yeah, that's what Peter did. He got so sick. I'm, you know, and I'm related to Peter, so I tell you, there's been a lot of times I said, I'm going fishing. Forget this stuff. Going fishing. So sometimes I make a fisherary trip. And I don't even tell you. I say it fast enough. You heard, huh, brother Minnow? A missionary trip. Really? I met Brother Menow and he's one of the most fun guys to fish with because he talks to every fish that comes on his line. Oh. Oh, look at this. Oh, yeah. This is a big one. I got it on video. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Come to papa. Here he is. You know. Oh, no. He's not so big. No. No. No man. I tell you, get the net. And then we had a couple boats. Dear Darren was with us. We had a couple boats of brothers. And I tell you what, when you get brothers that are fishing, they're liars. We're catching we're catching a 18-in walleye or pickrol. And somebody goes, "He's 24 in." I looked down. I said, "Are you kidding me? hat's only 18 in 16 in like that. Later we were having dinner and so we're sitting around and the brother very prominent minister. He said I told him I I called him on it. I said Dwayne Lawson. Oh, excuse me. I shouldn't have said that. I said Dwayne YOU WERE LYING TO THOSE GUYS IN THE OTHER BOAT. YOU WERE How could you do it? He said, "Brother Ron, I have learned that you never let a good fish story go by by having to tell the truth." &gt;&gt; Okay. So, once in a while, we have an exception when we go fishing. &gt;&gt; Dwayne, if he hears this, he's going to be upset with me. But I told him, I said, "Yeah, I I learned it from you, Dwayne. I can lie. I can tell these guys it's 36 in when it's only 16 or something. Now watch this. Now faith, this is six cents. I'm trying to bring this to a close. Give me about 10 more minutes. &gt;&gt; You need to recognize your day and your hour. &gt;&gt; Now we're not looking for another messenger. We're not looking for another prophet to come on the scene. There's only seven church ages, seven messengers. Are are we together on that? Okay. &gt;&gt; Not we're not looking for this messenger to return because he didn't finish his ministry. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to show you some things of what he said. So the true bride. I I I'm going to declare something that the true bride will catch a true revelation of who she is. &gt;&gt; It's happening. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's happening to every one of us. This is not a movement of man or of church. &gt;&gt; This is a movement of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is God doing it. It's God giving you revelation. It's God quickening it. It's God giving you. And you could be doing your dishes. You could BE DRIVING YOUR CAR. YOU BE TAKING care of the kids. You could be listening to a sermon. You could BE TAKING A WALK IN GOD. ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHAML. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WOO. WOW. He just gave ME A REVELATION. HOW WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE JETTISONED AT THAT VERY MOMENT UP INTO HEAVENLY places in Christ Jesus. What is he doing? He's changing your dimension. &gt;&gt; Understand this now. that Enoch walked in his revelation, did he not? Brother Brim said he was walking with God. &gt;&gt; He said, but his revelation got so great that one day. &gt;&gt; He said he put his foot up and it didn't come down. &gt;&gt; He said he stepped into another dimension. &gt;&gt; Let me declare unto you right now. Listen to me. We're stepping right now. &gt;&gt; Every one of you, I'm including all of you. I'm wanting to make all of you bride, but you're stepping into revelation that you never had before. &gt;&gt; And it's causing you to change. &gt;&gt; You're changing dimensions &gt;&gt; because the rapture is happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, WE'RE WE'RE WAITING FOR THE FINAL LAST minute of the change of our bodies. Right? &gt;&gt; Until then, you're going to be changed little by little. Here a little, here a little, THERE A LITTLE. GOD IS CHANGING YOU. HE'S HE'S WASHING YOU BY THE WATER OF THE WORD. And you're being changed. I've been changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's changing me from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; He's changing me &gt;&gt; until one day I'm going to step into that change. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me declare to you and you realize something. The bride has come to that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's here. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a time off. We're not going back and looking what God has done. We're seeing what God is doing presently. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to become multi-dimensional in your understanding because God is sharing with you revelation bringing you from your little onedimension &gt;&gt; that you MIGHT KNOW THE HEIGHT, THE BREADTH, THE LENGTH, ALL OF THIS THAT GOD WANTS TO SHARE WITH YOU THE fullness &gt;&gt; of God himself. &gt;&gt; I was sharing with my wife Sandy. I said I said Sandy there is a season for a woman of when she can get pregnant. I said what what do you call that? She said well when a woman is fertile. I said, "Oh, so it's not 365 days a year of every month. There is a time period, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; For a woman, you understand timing is everything with God. There is a time and a season where she is very fertile. And if during that time There is a union that takes place and the seed is passed. She will take that and it will quicken THAT LIFE INSIDE OF HER AND SHE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW THAT IT HAPPENED, BUT SHE CAN TELL A FEW DAYS AFTER SOMETHING'S CHANGING. My tastes are changing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I want to eat a pickle instead of ice cream. And then she begins to see within her body. She's realized, "Oh my, it's so funny. Sisters when they when they and it's their first baby and they get pregnant, they take a picture and it looks about like me right now. You can't even see it. There's not even a shadow." But until they get way out there and then nine months, when is this baby going to come? Yeah. I mean, hey, finally after they at the last week or two and they're they're so full that they my back you they used to walk like this. Now, now understand that there comes a time for this bride. &gt;&gt; Let's be mature. Now, at a time of the uniting time and sign, she will be in a season of fertility and she will be able to conceive seed. Now I want you to understand that God had been speaking to Abraham all those years and for 25 years God had met with Abraham in supernatural ways. He came and spoke to him in the flesh as Melzdc. He had all these dreams and different things and God SPEAKING TO HIM, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE a son. &gt;&gt; That's right. And for 25 years, God's dealing with him. At no time was there a personal meeting that God had with Sarah. Doesn't speak to her. She's just a secondhand recipient of her husband. &gt;&gt; You understand? But the Bible says in the book of Hebrews, Hebrews 11, let me show you through faith also Sarah herself. &gt;&gt; Now, she'd been receiving seed. There was nothing wrong with Abraham's message. &gt;&gt; There was nothing wrong with his seed. It was how she's receiving it. &gt;&gt; She had to come to a maturity &gt;&gt; because God's not going to marry a little immature little girl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's going to be a mature bride. &gt;&gt; And in her time of fertility, there's going to be an invisible union. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. through faith. Also Sarah herself received strength &gt;&gt; to conceive seed &gt;&gt; and was delivered of a child when she was past age. In other words, she was it was overdue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she judged him faithful that had promised. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and in the sand, which is by the seashore, innumerable. &gt;&gt; Because at the end, it looked like they're never going to produce seed because now they become as good as dead. Get out of your dimensional thinking &gt;&gt; because when it looks impossible, that's a time when God makes the impossible possible. Now, she had to come to a time that she would be moved on by faith herself. Faith's revelation. So, now she's old enough, she's mature enough, she's not going to pass it off to another church. &gt;&gt; She's going to say, "Be it unto me." So, and I want you to to to catch this because this is extremely important in questions and answers in 1957. Now, someday I'm going to leave here. I'm wondering what will be my end. Is it over? Is it just about? I'm 48 years old and it's just about over. I wonder this if it is. At 48, he was thinking he's an old man. I remember I came to the message when I was 18. Brother Brandham died. How old was he when he died? Anybody remember? &gt;&gt; 56. You know what? I thought he's an old man. &gt;&gt; Ancient of days. Now you to some of you guys, Brother Ron, he's ancient of bald-headed. Treasure chest is dropped. Yeah, he's he's had his day. 73, man. Ancient of days. But when you get older and you come to 56, 56, just a young man. &gt;&gt; Now, I have to I have to admit 70 was when I really felt 55, no problem. 60, 65, no problem. 70, I hit a wall. P splat. You want to play pickle ball? Are you kidding me? The only place I run to anymore is to the dinner table or to the bathroom. How many of you used to run? Yeah, I used to come down here to Phoenix. Oh, it was because I used to run in Flagstaff 7 10 miles. No problem. When I came here to Phoenix and I lived down there in Awatuki, I would wait until the heat of the day, 110, 115 degrees, get outside, run. The heat OF THE DAY. OH, this is good. I look at guys now and I go, "Poor guy. It's going to happen one day. Yeah, little bodily exercise, but some of you need a little help. That's true. So, we're coming now to a season. I'm very much and I'm acutely aware of this. Brother Brandon said, "Look, why didn't the world realize that picture there?" And he about the pillar of fire above his head. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why didn't they catch that right quick? &gt;&gt; Why they Why don't they catch these other things? Why don't they catch these prophecies and things? &gt;&gt; You know, they can't do it right now, but one day I'm going to leave the world. And when I leave, you're going to recognize it. &gt;&gt; Some of you young people will realize that after I'm gone. But God would not permit it to be done now. &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, one day, Brother Menow," he said, "After I'm gone," some of you young men, you were a young man back then, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; probably in your 20s, married, you were just coming into the understanding, huh? &gt;&gt; He said, "You young men have begin to catch this. I want all of you to understand that God had to take the forerunner off of the scene. What will be my end? What what is it? Do you think God made a mistake by taking the prophet off of the scene? &gt;&gt; Because our eyes were so much on the messenger, we failed to take his message. &gt;&gt; So God now pulls him off of the scene. John the Baptist said, "I must decrease &gt;&gt; that he must increase." &gt;&gt; The emphasis on the messenger is decreasing. Understand this not taking away &gt;&gt; because how dare we take away from that messenger that God sent. &gt;&gt; But now what about what did he say? So now we're getting our focus now as channeling of what the messenger said. &gt;&gt; That's why we have it on tape recording. And thank God we have it on tape because you know what? If it was all up to what people heard and what they understood, why there was so many different interpretations of what he said every time that he preached. &gt;&gt; Thank God we can go back. You want to know what he said on marriage and divorce? Play the tape. &gt;&gt; Huh? church order. Play the tape. &gt;&gt; Put them in remembrance. I listen. I'm just here as a Timothy telling you what Paul said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:25-29. Wherefore I'm made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you to fulfill to the mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory, &gt;&gt; whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom. that we may present every man perfect or mature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where to I also labor driving striving according to his working which workketh in me &gt;&gt; mightily &gt;&gt; come up hither John. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a suggestion. It was a changing of dimension. Come up hither, John. John, John, get out of that little onedimensional thinking &gt;&gt; and come up hither where I will show you things to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? Change dimensions. This message is causing you to change. &gt;&gt; It's changing you. And you're in a PROCESS RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE not done. &gt;&gt; You're in a transition. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have a little sign on you. I'm in transition. I ain't there yet, but I'm in transition. &gt;&gt; I haven't attained to where I want to be, but I'm going. &gt;&gt; You understand? I'm in the process in transition because he that begun a good work in me is going to finish it. And that is his business. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is determined &gt;&gt; that he's going to have a bride without spot and wrinkle. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the very fact that you are here today and you are under a ministry that is trying to preach to you what he said. You're coming to the time of a union. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD HAS DONE? HE CAME DOWN HERE THROUGH A PROPHET MESSENGER AND LET YOU KNOW THIS IS THE TIME TO UNITE WITH CHRIST THE WORD. AND WHEN YOU UNITE WITH YOUR HUSBAND, EVERYTHING HE HAS IS YOURS. musicians have become I want to bring this to a little summation here. Revelation is what God uses to move all of you into your position. all of you &gt;&gt; without exception. If you're not being moved &gt;&gt; into a position, you're not you're not his because God moves on each one of his. &gt;&gt; And if you are all if you are without chastisement, &gt;&gt; you're none of his. &gt;&gt; That's why others can get away. Don't look at others what they do. They may get away with it. You You try it. Fivefold ministry. Why me? Well, because &gt;&gt; that's right. I chose you. &gt;&gt; It's not you choosing me. I've chosen you. &gt;&gt; Faith is the six stance. Our heavenly father, the six sense, these testimonies from the Bible to the six sense, as I call it, faith. I was reading Hebrews 11 of the six sense. Faith being the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things that senses of the earth don't declare. And we see through there how they subdued kingdoms, stopped the mouths of lions, escaped the edge of the sword. Enoch was translated into heavenly into heaven by the six sense. Abraham sojourned in a strange land and received a son after he was 100 years old. Six sense when Sarah's womb was dead, he considered not those things. He staggered not that the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong, giving glory to God. He knowed God made the promise and God was fully persuaded God would keep what he had promised. God wake up that six sense &gt;&gt; in this church among these people tonight when we see that you gave great sign to Abraham and there what taken place let them see the angel of the Lord's presence tonight and rely not upon their feeling &gt;&gt; or upon their sight but upon the word of God that made the promise and every person in here will be healed. Everyone that's unsaved will be saved and all without the Holy Ghost will receive it. Hear me, Father. I pray in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A prophet was a sign, a channel, &gt;&gt; an opening, a window. &gt;&gt; Do you believe me? Do you do you believe me &gt;&gt; to be God's prophet? And when you when you say yes, you know what you do? You're activating that window. &gt;&gt; And now you have an ability to become multi-dimensional &gt;&gt; that you get out of your little selfish state. It's all about me and what I do and church is a convenience. Church will never be convenient. &gt;&gt; In fact, it's going to get harder and harder. &gt;&gt; Church is a commitment. Takes a commitment to go to to follow God. Takes a commitment. &gt;&gt; You cannot ascend into a higher dimension by church attendance. Oh, well, I go to church. That's good. But what do you do when you're here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You cannot come higher without your revelation pulling you. What do you think the third pull is? &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word. &gt;&gt; Had he right, all she did was hear a testimony. &gt;&gt; God did this and God did that. And she got so excited. It wasn't in a prayer line. &gt;&gt; It wasn't even in church. In fact, I'll have all of you to know that the five indications of the third pull was not done in church. That's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; She with her mouth activated &gt;&gt; because SHE WAS REALIZING GOD'S PROPHET WAS THERE. THERE WAS A window &gt;&gt; and he became &gt;&gt; so ACTIVATED TO THIS PROPHET. He began to speak the word. He would speak and create. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what I wish to launch off into next. You know what God was doing through the ministry of this prophet? Creating himself a bride. How was he doing it? Line upon line. Precept upon precept. Tape upon tape. You know what he's doing? saying she'll have this character. &gt;&gt; She was a spoken word, &gt;&gt; seed, &gt;&gt; bride, &gt;&gt; that makes you a part of him. He said, understand that this spoken word seed bride is as eternal as he is. You cannot die &gt;&gt; no more than God can die. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. When the wheels of this mortal life stand still and you're transported, Brother Bram said death is only harnessing &gt;&gt; to pull you into that other dimension. Brother Brennan, when he got over there, you know what he said? Did I fear this? You know what he feared? Going back. Don't send me back. Oh my, this is so great over here. You mean I feared this? &gt;&gt; Don't you fear it, saints? Yes. &gt;&gt; Because he that hath the Son &gt;&gt; hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life. &gt;&gt; You are as immortal as God himself. &gt;&gt; And the reason that God sent you this message &gt;&gt; is to make you multi-dimensional in your thinking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Enoch walked with God. Hebrews 11:5-6. And this is my finishing statement. Excuse me. All right. Let's go to Hebrews. It's on the screen. By faith, Enoch was translated that he should not see death. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and was not because God had translated him for before his translation. So before the event, &gt;&gt; he had this testimony &gt;&gt; that he pleased God because the Bible says without faith it's impossible to please him. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, this bride is going to have the faith, not your faith, God's faith. &gt;&gt; It's God's business. We hear from brother James, brother Steven, these brethren preaching to us about the father's business. This is it. This is it. &gt;&gt; I must be about my father's business. not done on his career, not being a painter or this and that. No, let me tell you, God's calling you out of this one little dimension into something far greater. &gt;&gt; And thank God that he sent a prophet. He looked beyond the curtain of time. He said, "I seen hundreds, thousands of them." He said, "These are yours. Are these all Brandoms? No. No. He said they're your converts. Listen, this bride is not going to be this bride out loud. You see, is not going to be just a handful. The table thousands of mine. &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw them over there. I hugged her necks. Do you recognize this this beautiful young woman? Oh, my precious brother. He said, "You won her to Christ when she's 90 some odd years old." We are about ready to have the greatest youth convention this world has ever seen. I'm closer, Brother Dave Maple. I am closer to 20 than I've ever been. Amen. &gt;&gt; Closer to 18. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says, "If this body be dissolved, &gt;&gt; I have another one." &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "When you are catching revelation, you're hearing from &gt;&gt; your theophony." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it? The part of you that never fell. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The part of you that God had in his mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you realize it's you encouraging you? DO YOU REALIZE IT'S GOD CALLING ONTO GOD? DO YOU REALIZE IT AIN'T YOU? IT'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU THAT'S QUICKENING AND PULLING YOU. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I LOVE HIM THIS MORNING. DON'T YOU? &gt;&gt; This is getting greater. HE SAID, "WATCH AFTER I'M GONE, YOU'LL BEGIN TO CATCH THESE THINGS." &gt;&gt; OH, BACK THEN. PROPHET, PROPHET, PROPHET. The seasons changed. &gt;&gt; Now to the prophet's message. &gt;&gt; Do we take away from the prophet? &gt;&gt; No. This is why he came. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Okay, I got to be careful because I start to want to preach the next couple sermons that I have. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love him. Don't you? Let's stand together this morning. If you love him, put your hands together. Give him a praise offering. Yeah. Amen. Amen. This message WAS FOR YOU. GOD came looking for you. &gt;&gt; You didn't go LOOKING FOR IT. GOD went looking for you. Because you are seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You had the ability to be reborn. Because if you're nonse, YOU GOT no ability. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. Let your word be born &gt;&gt; in the manger. &gt;&gt; Word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live. star live inside this house and hold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. First verse was a tiny simple stable all in one. Are we amazed for a king to be born? He didn't choose some place special to reveal his fantasies. So when I found you in control your word in the manger of Oh come inside his house and holy air. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord in the manger of my &gt;&gt; second verse. Outwardly I'm nothing. Our ability comes to behold likely for virtue untold. You got to yield the vessel. Just yield this vessel. Let him have his way from glory glory. He'll change you change me day by day.

You cannot put God in a box &gt;&gt; because he is higher. He's wider. He's taller. Whatever he's deeper, whatever your need is, he is so big. You can't confine him to one little box. God is big and he has everything in his control. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that I have eyes to see and a heart to believe. What you have need of, you can receive. You can receive. Do you love the Lord today?
