right there isn't it huh it's good to have family to visit you and everything so we just love God love him with all our hearts amen amen and um Lord willing I will be ministering next Sunday I will get back into my post of Duty I've kind of isolated myself insulated isolated uh just getting over this and the doctor released me uh the other day the pulmonologist from uh the hospital and he talked to me went over all of the different things said you don't need oxygen anymore you're doing good two months from now we'll do another CAT scan we'll look and we'll see and everything but you know look saints of God let's face it you get sick you have to go to the doctor you go to the hospital doctor's doctor that's what they do huh a lot of times they don't have any idea so they they probe around and they try this and that and you become a human guinea pig and if this don't work and if it didn't kill you then we'll try to we'll switch the medicine and and everything cuz they bury their mistakes I'm not trying to be a comedian but really saints of God really you can sit there in the hospital they can give you the antibiotics and everything like that but God is the one that is the Healer I can remember in the hospital I just got so inspired they had some kind of a Contraption it went over my head and it looked like an oxygen mask that the World War I Pilots would wear and stuff like this and this thing it it felt like a regulator from a SCUBA tank that when you took air man it was just forcing this stuff uh and and and my lungs were filling up and everything and and actually was quite comfortable I slept with it all night I yeah it was good so anyway long story short I reached up I just felt an inspiration I put my hand on that I have put my hand on the air hose I said in Jesus name I reached over to the ivy that I got antibiotics all this kind of stuff got needles sticking in me everywhere and I just grabbed him and I said in Jesus name amen May every drip bring healing huh come on brother Brenham said God uses doctors God uses medicine if he doesn't he says then you have to make it of the devil right but really the last court of appeal they can give you everything and you can be looks like you're doing well and you're uh you know you're coming out of it and all of a sudden he takes your number but your number cannot be call unless God allows it he said your days here on Earth no matter how huh so I thank God and I thank God for my health I think hey do not take your health for granted okay and uh so I thank God the Bible says that he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church so we thank God I believe that what God is doing right now this bride is maturing she is not a Young Bride anymore she is matured she is taking the message and hearing the voice behind the veil somebody say amen amen that's what's happening the quickening power of Revelation is striking the bride the Bible says in the book of Hebrews 11 and Mary by faith right receive seed to conceive the conception now is taking taking place right now many have heard the message but the wise hear something different remember you have the 10 wise five wise five foolish 10 virgins yes so just because you came out and you recognize that God sent a prophet that's good that's wonderful praise God that's a beginning yeah what are you doing with this message amen good question that's it is it manifesting in your life is it changing you because if there is no manifestation if there is no change in the physical you're just listening but when you hear my all of a sudden light strikes that seed praise God and it manifests in your life manifestation is what it's all about and Enoch one day he was not because God took him Amen brother Bram said there he was just walking wasn't doing any Miracles he wasn't in some Big Revival waiting for somebody to get him all pumped up he just had a daily walk and that's what I encourage every one of you that that 2024 let it be a daily walk with God Amen don't you love him this morning and let his Revelation come to you strike your soul amen cause you to be changed amen because if he's not changing you you change the way you're listening Hall amen for Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God Amen I'm excited amen I am I've had so many little sermon titles coming to me in directions that I want to preach my wife asked me the other day she says honey you K told her I said I just got a thought man it was just Quicken to me I just got me a thought and I'm getting all energizing and 5 10 minutes later she says uh did you write it down I said I don't need to write everything down I said it was just Quicken ah wrong thing to say cuz the last day and a half I'm been going what was that what was it it started with an L it you know it sounded like cyberspace so I humble myself sweetheart you're right write it down go back how many of you ever done that you know yeah well I better write that down I won't forget it and you forget it now also to just so that you know next Wednesday the Lord willing I'm going to take some of the brothers I will contact you James love all and and perhaps some of those as James was saying I didn't get to show the Batu report he didn't it just too quick and this and that and here it is and and it just didn't go over I I just wasn't pleased with that so next Wednesday I want to do a v a real vanat report and I will sum it up and I'll show you some pictures of mine but James and the different ones I'll have you probably come back up here Tim offer uh you guys just be prepared uh again this will be this coming Wednesday uh and also Al uh brother Neil moer I don't know if any of you know the testimony of what he has been through stand up brother Neil thank you brother Neil brother Neil went ahead and contacted Steven McNeely and he says hey I'm ready to to take a a service and uh uh I'm saying uh brother Neil what I'd like to do is get together with you and see your presentation see your photos let's get together let's work on it and we'll have you probably take a Wednesday night and uh uh you know a whole hour or so to let you know I I'm just going to say this that the very first doctor the heart surgeon that when I walked into the room you know and and I asked ask him I said because he had aortic dissection which is one of the worst situations that actually was right there and it started to Slough off and the aorta began to just and they call it if you want to look up this is not a medical terminology but it is also recognized trash foot trash foot look it up what it does is all of this stuff that sloughs off from the inside of the aorta goes through the and it goes to all of the capillaries the smallest tiny little blood carrying things that when you prick your finger and it bleeds here and it goes to the nose it goes to the fingers it goes to the toes and we noticed it Brian and Sarah we s notice the foot started turning a little bit purple his nose look like uh uh it started turning bright red and different things and um the doctor said this man is a miracle and said every day for him is another miracle and I want because he is he's basically defying medical whatever you call it technology whatever because they don't know so I want to give the glory to God that we have a man that is defying making a mystery of of the medical world and everything and the Lord willing I will be taking him at some time with me to go and give testimonies and I think Across America here brother Neil there'll be different ones that's going to invite you to come and say give us your testimony of what you went through what it was like because if you've ever been in a dark spot he went through a very very dark time and some of us go through some time very dark times but guess what he said I'll be with you even in you until when end of the world so we believe that so those are a few things that we have uh coming up and uh be praying for us and God bless you brother Rober I'm turn it back over to you I'm excited that you a family God bless you 15 months way too long amen let's stand this morning he's in the house today let's not leave him in this building but let him be in this house in this house and this house throughout our week he's in the house let's sing it this morning as brother Steven comes today little girl was lying there people are were weeping they just laughed at Jesus said she said she's only sleeping as he took her by the hand she began to live again some begin to praise the Lord some begin to say he's in the house oh death and now there is life where Darkness used to be and now there is hope and there's no more doubt I will praise His name praise His name he's in the house we were like that little girl dead and all our sin so Jesus touch his heart and my and gave me again I am just a house of ever since and blessed day there's a light that shines on me for all the world to's in the house morning oh now there is light where darkness is now there is there's no more oh praise His name praise His praise His name praise His name praise I will praise His name praise His name to praise His name in the Hallelujah we know that when Jesus comes by that miracles happen that when he's in the house guess what the house changes all the trash and all the things that are probably unseen to the outside world when Jesus comes into the house he cleans the house up amen praise the Lord let's pray this morning Father Lord we love you with all of our hearts and we are so grateful for the work that you've began in our lives and Lord we have this confidence that you are going to finish the work that you've started in our lives I ask that you would come and be the minister this morning Lord may I just be the vessel in the voice but may you minister to your people minister to the hearts and to the needs of each and every one we ask it for thy Kingdom's Glory now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you musicians thank you so much and God bless you welcome to the house of the Lord we greet you in the name of Jesus Christ and it's always a privilege to be here and to hear God's word if you have your Bible turn with me to the Book of John and chapter 1 and uh we certainly appreciate appreciate the opportunity that our pastor gives us to minister the word John chap 1 and verses 1 through3 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen you may be seated this morning I would like to title my sermon continuing on with this thought of the word and this is part three when we think of the word of God there's many things that we could say to describe the word we realize that the word of God is our absolute it is the guide of Our Lives it is our comforter it's our high tower it is the answers to all the questions in life cu the Bible says that he has given onto us uh all things that pertain to godliness and the things of this life the word is life to the believer without the word we have no life and so to us as Believers guess what this word of God is life and without it we don't have anything without the word of God guess what we don't know who we are we have no identity we have no inheritance we have no promises we have nothing but in the word we have all all things the word of God brings peace in the midst of our storms it brings light in times of Darkness the word of God is truth what is truth this is truth it provides light therefore it gives life the word is our blueprint for our life in which we are to uh uh live our lives before the people amen hallelujah and as Believers we should want to govern Our Lives after the word of God the word of God is water in a thirsty land in other words the word of God it satisfies the believer whenever the believer is in a desert Place guess what the word of God does it brings water it brings nutrients it brings brings life it brings it it quenches Hallelujah the very thirst that we have amongst many other things we could call this word of God but the word of God in our Bibles is God himself and so we realize that in our opening scripture that said that all things were made by him somebody say him and they were made for him so in other words we could say that God is a man God has the attributes of a man within himself there's many people today that excuse me there's many people today I don't know if you've seen any of the videos or not and they get up and they stand before the people and they're worshiping God and they and they speak to God this great eternal spirit and they say and they end it and and and they don't want to say him they don't want to say in the name of Jesus Christ but they say in the name of it the great eternal spirit understand when you take the name away you take the power away because people today are so into pronouns and and this and that and you don't want to offend anybody but I want to say this that God is a man and so when God made Adam and Adam in the beginning and he said go forth and and multiply the Earth we realize that he was a spirit man but within that Spirit man was also a feminist spirit and so when God was speaking to the man he was speaking both to the masculine and to the feminist and we realize that there was a time when the the feminist was taken out of the man and now she was made manifested before Adam it's the exact same thing with God he was trying to show us something that within him there was a feminist Spirit there was a a an attribute that laid within God that would be manifested one day that he would say that is my bride that is bone of my bone and that is Flesh of My Flesh and I believe that we as the of Jesus Christ are fulfilling the very attributes and thoughts of God in this [Applause] day Hallelujah we see that within Christ Christianity Today that that they change God in order to uh in order to uh suffice their thoughts and and and their feelings of what they are in that certain day right if you want God to be this well guess what that's what God is to you and if you feel that God is that well that's what God is to you but they're worshiping Satan and they don't even realize it they're worshiping God all right but they're not worshiping the God of this Bible they're not worshiping the God of all creation because he never changes because he is the same yesterday today and forever so therefore we we think my I don't want God to change to my thoughts or my feelings but I want to change to how God wants me to be I believe that that's the desire of every believer we find out that in the be uh the N see a council there what did they do they they all got together and they came together and they come up with this Doctrine and they came up with that Doctrine and all of a sudden we have the doctrine of the Trinity what what were they doing they were making God according to what they thought he was but the scripture says here o Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord he's not three separate persons but he's one God what did they do whenever they split God up into three people they took away the power any wonder that people would say well go God isn't alive today because there's no Miracles there's no signs there's there's nothing being done if and if I could think of one of the things that brother brandham did in his ministry he brought the god of History into our present time why because he brought us back into the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ he brought us back into the name because there's life behind the name yes sir anything that you say or do do it all in what the name of Jesus Christ whether in word whether In Deed whether you're at work whether you're at school whether you're at home with your family do all things and if you can't do it in the name of Jesus Christ don't do it if you can't go there in the name of Jesus Christ don't go there amen amen amen 196 65 who is this MDC brother brandham says paragraph 55 notice now his attribute then the attribute was first God the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us St John the first chapter and the first verse in the beginning but before for the Eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought so we realized that God dwelt Alone with his thoughts and everything that we see is an expression of the thoughts of almighty God can you say amen amen he says and then the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us he said hold that there now notice his first being was Spirit God Supernatural all right the great Eternal second he begin to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body so now what is a theophonic he was in the form of theop now we'll get into that and prove it in a few minutes the Lord willing he was the word now God begins to condescend and I know I I I probably sound like a little bit of a a broken record but that's okay uh you can just bear with me all right but God be to condescend and the reason that he was coming down to earth is because he wanted to fulfill the plan that he had in his mind since the foundations of the world and so we realize that God begin to condescend that he might meet us that we might Ascend to where he is and so the word of God became flesh that the flesh you and I might become the word cuz we're going to see that we bypassed our word theophany body that we might come here to Earth to be tempted by sin and so what's God's desire his desire is that we stay not in this body of Flesh that is corruptible and it was made by sin but his desire is that we would go back to that word body that's when you know all things Hallelujah excuse me praise the Lord and that body that body is all knowing and in that body there's no sin that's why we have to be changed because we were born in sin shaped in anity come to the world speaking lies why because of the conception and in how we were birthed so therefore not only do we have to be born again but this vile body that we dwell in it must be changed because no sin can come into the presence of God so we realize that when he met with Abraham he was in his theophany body when he when he passed by Moses Moses saw the hindered parts of God he saw the the back of God and what did it look like it looked like the image of a man we realize that when he was uh uh with the Hebrew children there in the fiery furnace there was an image of a man that looked like like the son of man what were these things it was the theophany of God himself when Jesus died and he was buried in the Tomb and he went to hell and he preached to them uh those Sinners down there in hell guess what body he was in a theophany body it is the same God that is moving down through time but he's just changing his m askk as he goes along now brother brandom ties this scripture this uh this together with the scripture of 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 1 and it says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle we're dissolved we have a building of God not made with hands Eternal in the heavens this is our theophany body this is the body that we have whenever if if we were to pass on and we were to go beyond the curtain of time this is the body that we go to hallelujah we're not just some little cloud or some little imagination or something remember brother Bram he gives the story he says my I thought I always was scared of death because I always thought would I know brother Neville and would I know this brother and and we' just be like this little Cloud just floating about in eternity he said no when I passed the curtain of time he said I didn't fear death no more because it's real they're real people they're people that can see people that can touch people that can hug people that can feel they're real people what is it it's a different body but the same person so now we come to find out that death does not change our Dwelling Place our death does not change us excuse me but it just Chang changes our Dwelling Place God is so good to us that though this body deteriorates and though this body decays and though you might lose a couple of legs brother Neil on the other side of that we have a perfect body a body that is not made by hands but a body that is made by the word of God Amen now watch what he does to the Sinners there's a question and it says what body uh do those who have never accepted Christ what body do they resurrect in he said the same body that they went down in they don't get no new body whatever however they died and however their body looked at that time that's how they're going to look oh my what a God that we serve full of grace full of Mercy Full Of Love full of compassion 1960 H uh having con conferences and here come in he's talking about when he passed the curtain of time looked like they were had kind of shaggy hair on their shoulder and they were the nicest looking people I ever seen eyes is staring pearly white teeth they were throwing their arms around me and saying oh our precious brother and one of them hollered at the other one and said think he's arrived he's arrived at last and when I read this portion of this of this sermon here I realized that they noticed who he was they knew exactly who he was though he was a a young man with curly black hair and though he was in the uh the he looked like he was in the Youth of life again he didn't look like how he was when he was preaching but they knew exactly who brother brandham was and there was another lady and she and uh remember the lady and the and the angel told him and said you you recognize her on the one that you've been admiring the one that you've been looking at he said no I don't you led her to God when she was 9 0 plus years old and now she begins to witness to brother brandom and she begins to tell them of the things that's going to happen uh if if I can remember how it goes that um that uh she told him no we have to stay here a while and then you're going to take us over here and meet Jesus and all these different things she knew exactly who he was understand whenever we cross over the other side you're going to know exactly who those people are and you're going to recognize one another and you're going to say my precious brother my precious sister you're here finally you're here you've made it there will be a remembrance of the good things there be no remembrance of the of the things that you suffered and the sin that you struck struggled with in this life no no because you're in a new body you're in a perfect body you have a perfect mind that is not surrounded by complexes of life but it'll be perfect and you'll love one another in perfectness because it'll be perfect love you won't remember how somebody did a brother deal on you yep brother deals will be washed from your remembrance amen all you remember is I know that face and God bless you what do we ought to do right now as we're here a yeah he gave me a brother deal it didn't work out God bless you you are my brother I forgive you amen and who is this MDC n uh paragraph 68 he says now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word now he's going to make a distinction between us as sons and daughters and as Jesus as a son he said he was the word and in morab body he came and lived in that in the person of MDC then later we never heard no more of MDC because he became Jesus Christ MDC was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now watch this he says now you bypassed that so now he's talking to you and I what did we bypass we bypassed that word body because in that form he knowed all things and you never been able to know that yet you come like Adam like me you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted I want want to ask you which one of us are exempt from Temptations which one of us are exempt from trials and tribulations none of us why because it was all in the plan of God Almighty that we would bypass that word body and come down in the flesh that we might be tempted so if you're tempted if you're tempted you are blessed amen that's a tough one to swallow isn't it yeah all of you are saying uh-uh I don't feel no blessing when I'm tempted yeah you're blessed he said but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we done now we don't understand it we have never become the word what's he talking about he's talking about the word and its fullness amen let me say this though we are becoming the word we have not become the word but we are becoming the word until there will come a time where we will become the word we got something to look forward to we got something to be happy about why because this isn't our last dwelling place we got something to reach joice why because I'm going somewhere I'm I'm I'm on a journey I'm going to a a final destination where I'm going to become what I've always desired to be Hallelujah you won't have to have to make it up you won't have to try or push or prog no you'll be the word in its fullness that's why we get so discouraged sometimes in ourselves it's because we have this something within us that's crying out that I want to be perfect I I I I I want to be the word in its fullness and you get so discouraged in yourself but understand there's a place that we're going to there's a destiny that every believer has a destination that we will become the word [Applause] itself you say brother how is that possible because you were in the word in the beginning Oh Glory he says Ah but and look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning that proves a predestination of God see you can't be the word unless you were a thought Hallelujah you had to be in the thinking first it amen but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the the offy you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father has given me will come onto me and I'll raise him up in the last days see you had to be first I got to thinking why would God let us bypass our theophany why would God let us come to a place where we would be in this flesh and that he had a thought in his mind that you and I would be tempted of sin that you and I would be tempted by trials in our lives and by Temptations in our lives and by all these different things that seem to go wrong in our lives why would God do that to us if we were sons and daughters why would he do it if he loved us if God was this big Fountain of Love why would he bring me here as one of his kin folk why would he bring me here as flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone to be tempted of sin and so I asked myself that question why would God have us bypass our theophany and as I begin to think of this I I thought of Temptation and I thought of Temptation by sin and there's one of two things that happen whenever we are tempted of sin whenever we're tempted by unbelief in our lives one thing that H that could happen is you overcome you overcome the trial you overcome the thought you overcome it and and and you overcome this and you overcome that and my goodness you feel real good but the other thing that happens is that we fall we have a Temptation we have this thought we have this reaction to an action in our lives and it causes us to fall in sin one of two things that happens right understand that God uses both the overcoming and the falling in our flesh for his own benefit and for our own good amen amen when we overcome anything my it it makes us feel that God is really with us doesn't it it makes us feel good it it gives us uh a strengthen our faith and we think my goodness I could run through a troop and I could leap over a wall and I could do all these different things and I feel like I could just cut any devil's head off and and and my goodness my I got big Burly Faith muscles and it feels so good you feel that God is with you and God is with you and God is letting us go through those experience for us to realize that number one he is with us and number two that he is mighty in [Applause] battle but when the fall comes and perhaps I'm not the only one here this morning I feel like I fall more than what I overcome amen I feel like I mess up more than more than what I do right it doesn't matter the desire that's in my heart sometimes I it just seems that I the I undergo amen I react the wrong way I say the wrong thing I do the wrong thing I and it just I I sometimes I feel like the Apostle Paul and I say oh the vile rested miserable guy that you are you need a good slapping you know sometimes I wish that God would whip me real hard I deserve it sure I deserve a hard whipping Papa God and he comes over and he corrects you out of love am what is God showing to us in that time that those you deserved judgment but though you deserved a good old weaping from Papa God yet he corrects Us in love and we think my the mercy and grace of God in my life I didn't deserve this kind of Correction but he's given it to me anyways Hallelujah what's God doing he's revealing his grace to you he's revealing his Mercy to you we find out when we fall he picks us back up amen when we're discouraged in our mind and in our flesh he gives us encouragement when we're sick under I'm talking about trials and temptations tribulations in our flesh when we're sick what does he do he heals our bodies whenever we have a need in our lives he's Jehovah jar he meets that need that's within our lives when we deserve punishment he gives us Grace when we deserve judgment guess what the mercy of God it overflows whatever uh whatever bad thing that you've done in your life so we when we begin to see these things I realize that God reveals himself more in our downfalls right than he does when we overcome God reveals himself more in our downfalls in our mistakes and failures than he does when we overcome thank you Lord CU a lot of times when we overcome we think look what I did I overcame that I did this and so much of the time we get so prideful whenever it's God that's doing the overcoming in our [Music] lives so what is God doing now through the things that we suffer in this life he is revealing to us his great attributes that's right James 1: 2 and 4 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing now we realize that the scripture says this that all things work together for the good finish the quote finish the scripture to those who love God Amen and are called according to his purpose so we realize that this scripture is only for the bride it is only for us who are called according to his purpose because he has a purpose in his calling in which he has called us in this life that's right but all things don't work together for the good to those who are not called for those who are not called according to his purpose to those who do not love God Amen all things do not work together for the good of those people that's why you could have the same situation as somebody else as an unbeliever and they could take their lives and you can have a peace of God within your heart why because it's working together for the good so now we we see this that it says counted all joy when you enter into diverse Temptations how many view are so joyful this morning of the trials and tribulations and temptations of L aa oh well praise God hallelujah I am so joyful and I feel so good and and and and this is just wonderful I've had the worst day of my life this is excellent I love it so much Lord there ain't one of us thinks like that give me your medication if you do I would like some of it happy pills huh the gosp pill is only the only thing that give you happiness amen yes but what is it it's when you have the revelation of I know this is happening in my life I know I've had a refere I know and I know and I know but I'm understanding that the scripture says because we always want to bring it back to what the scripture says because the scriptures are absolute we can't bring it back to some psychology of man well yeah and try to work it out and and and watch these different videos online no take it all back to the word and so I can take it back to the word and say I understand that this might not be joyful at the time I understand that I might not be joyous and happy at this time but I know that God is doing something in my life and I know that it is working together for the good amen amen and so that's where we can have the joy of our Salvation right amen amen not that you feel good going through stuff right but that you have a joy in knowing that I've been called and I love God according to his purpose I know this is working together for my good it may not be nice I may not be happy but I understand that God is working in my life it's good for us to remind ourselves of these things always bring it back to the scriptures amen because the scripture has the answer right the scripture has the antidote Hallelujah I find myself praying in times of distress and Times of how would I put it uh uh I don't really get anxiety but perhaps I do and I don't realize it CU I'm just mad sometimes huh times of this and Times of that I I realize I don't pray for God to take it away I don't ask God why it's not my business to know why I don't care according to the flesh man but I know why according to the spiritual man it cuz I know what God is doing I know he's molding my character I know he's doing something in my life CU he has a desire to bring me into the image of the word because I am not the word in its fullness now but I am becoming the word sermon by sermon message by message scripture by scripture day by day guess what's happening I am becoming the word because I'm being Washed by the word and so I I I I tend not to have a pity party but I say father give me the strength to overcome this thing that I'm going through in my life and you'll see that God will give you the strength to overcoming Hallelujah the angels in heaven the ones that worship before God the ones that are before his very Presence at all times will never know God like you will know Papa God there's not one angel in heaven that can sing the song of Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound with the revelation of somebody that has found Grace in God the angels and in heaven can never talk about God's mercy in their lives when they deserve judgment because they never went through that stage they were perfect they're without sin they're before his presence at all times but when we come Hallelujah when we come before God understand the angels will have to stay silent why because they can't worship how a blood bought sinner in this Earth can worship God why because we realize where we came from and to where we are in his presence and we say father I'm so undeserving but I worship you Lord thank you God hallelujah so let me ask you whose worship is greater the angels in heaven are your worship here on Earth oh my God your worship and your praise and your adoration goes Before the Throne of God and he loves to hear that more than the worship of all these angels cuz they were made to worship that's right they're told to worship that's their job is to worship but you and I are on free moral agency we're not told to do anything but we do it out of love we do it because we want to we worship God because it's a desire that's in our hearts not because somebody told us to do it you're at church today not because somebody told you to come but because you have a desire of God that he has placed in your heart to worship [Applause] him now we really realize that the word was made flesh and that and the word is still flesh and it's made manifest amongst us it's the great mystery of God is now being fulfilled before our very eyes that is Christ in you the hope of glory and we say it a lot and we preach it a lot but yet it's the truth because it's where we're at in the timeline of God now sometimes to us it's a mystery sometimes when Satan looks at us he says oh yeah that's definitely a son or a daughter of God that's him he's a son I seen how that went and then there's other times he looks at us and he goes that ain't no son or daughter of God it's a mystery that's a mystery but I want to bring this to a place of we speak about it and we preach about it a lot and we realize that it's the truth but what does it really mean for the word to be made flesh in this hour not only what does it mean but what does it look like right how does the word act how does the word behave itself how does the word look when it's being manifested amongst the people Colossians 1:26 and 27 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now it's being made manifest to his Saints to whom God would be known what is the riches of the glory of his mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory in the sermon marage and divorce paragraph 258 brother brandham says and so is it with the church that refuses to become pregnated in the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age so there's a purpose there's a desire that God has and that's to bring forth children of this age we are not lutherans we're not Wesley neither are we Pentecostals we've got to be the children of this age through the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth a child of this age he says it's the seed child amen I hope you understand couldn't be pregnated no so what did he do put her away in forcement that's right but she dares put him away put her away he put her away he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating him Same by himself his children begin to kind of look more like him because it's fully maturing or they become children of the word not children of the church so whenever we preach from the word it's going to bring forth a word birth birth and when a word birth happens it brings forth a word child or a seed child of this age not just stopping at justification justification is okay but that was in Luther's day not just stopping at a cleaned up life not just stopping at the restoration of the gifts not just stopping at cuz the three combined they bring the new birth but he said going on not stopping going past these things into this age that we are now living in what is this age it is age of adoption it is age of full Authority and power it is the age of knowing our position in Christ knowing when to speak to speak when he tells us to speak and knowing to say stay silent when he tells us to be silent that's the work of the Bride in this day the work of the Bride is not to try to manufacture something up of another age but when he tells us to be quiet we stay still why because his wife is an obedient wife she is an obedient woman and she wants to please her husband so he doesn't speak she doesn't speak very good but when he tells her to speak she speaks and not only does she speak but she speaks with authority how can she speak with authority because she has the backing of her husband because when she is speaking she is saying the same thing that he is saying the spirit and the bride say come you remember when the the brother Brown talks about the Capstone what is it that it's Grace it's [Applause] Grace did you know that we're living right now in the Capstone ministry right yes sir many of you you all you all know the pyramid and brother brandham talks about the pyramids in Egypt and he types these pyramids out and he says each slab of rock lays upon each slab of rock just perect L and it's so well manufactured and built that you can't put a razor blade between each one right and so now through Luther and Wesley and Pentecost now brother brandom comes along and he comes along with a message that is making a way for the Capstone itself when penic cost had its Doctrine and it its principles that it followed that uh that that that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and and Sensations and all these different things that was that was going wild and Loosely amongst the Pentecostal people brother brandom had to come along and correct it so they were building on top of Wesley but they were not building correctly because the rocks that were they were putting on top of Wesley there was one up here and one down here and one up here and one down here and one was trinitarian and one was Oneness and one was this and one was that and there was absolutely no way that the Capstone could come down and sit perfectly upon Pentecost so now we have Elijah the prophet just as he was uh back on Mount Carmel and he took those stones the of the altar that was dismantled he didn't take no new Stones he didn't take no new rocks but he took the same ones the same revelation the same scriptures and now he begins to set them in order and he says this doesn't belong over here and this doesn't belong over here but I'm going to switch them because they belong in the plan of God and he put them in its rightful position amen why was he doing that because the Capstone was coming the Capstone was luring and there had to be a Ministry that it would flatten out the rest and say now it's ready now it's ready the ground has been prepared the altar has been made we're ready for this Capstone Ministry what is the cloud all about it's a Capstone yes sir the very Mind Of God coming down to his people why did it come down because the first part of his ministry was done it was no longer a public show before the people people but here he come condescending condescending why because the time was [Applause] right amen what is this great mysterious Cloud yeah sir is it just a a picture in Life Magazine is it just something that people saw in Tucson and these different places what is the attraction at sunset Mountain at the time of sunset the sun setting and the the sands of time disappearing what is this attraction it is God fulfilling his word it is god making his word manifested it is God coming as a judge now brother brandom what was he doing in the early parts of his ministry is making the circle bigger oh praise the Lord You're all my brethren but after the opening of the seals things changed in his ministry there was no longer a public Ministry but he would you understand that a lot of brother brandham sermons doctrinal teachings where did he preach him he preach him in Tucson did he preach him in Phoenix Jeffersonville amen he said if I got a new sermon or a new thought I'll preach it here first at the church at the brandham Tabernacle no longer a public show he's not preaching Doctrine out over here in worldwide evangelism but now he really starts to preach Doctrine right serpent seed you think brother brandham could have preached uh where I think uh Pentecost failed had a Pentecostal Church yeah don't come back but he had a place what was it the doctrinal teachings of his ministry was not for the public so now Jesus Takes the people and he speaks in Parables and so now the disciples come to a point and say Lord can can you can you teach us you see you got to ask God if you don't ask God God ain't going to help if you don't ask God God's not going to reveal anything to you if you never ask for help in your life you will never receive help amen amen and so now he takes him to the side he says unto you it is given but unto them it's not given to know the mysteries of God I thought about this why wouldn't he just choose the 12 disciples and why wouldn't he just take them to a side and teach them old things and forget everybody else why would he let the multitudes follow them and then why would he let the multitudes Fall Away Jesus's mission on Earth was that the scriptures might be fulfilled right yeah that having ears to hear they would hear not and having eyes to see they would understand not what would they not hear or understand they wouldn't understand the day of the message in which they were living in right and so God has done the same thing in this day this message has attracted many people it has attracted many people from many parts of the world for many reasons but God now is very slowly he has been for years this one that doesn't belong and this one that is following for for reasons that they shouldn't be guess what they're starting to fall away why is it happening having ears to hear what the spirit say says but they they can't understand it having eyes to see but they they don't understand the scripture being fulfilled in our very day amen praise the Lord where am I here continuing on with that quote uh brother Brenham says and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made Theory she'll be purely unadulterated amen Bride of the word amen and amen I hope you get that out in the air she will be the pregnated daughter of God hallelujah we are to receive the seed of God in order to be be pregnated by the word because we realize that the word of God is a seed and that seed will always bring forth of its kind and so if we are being pregnated of the word we are supposed to bring forth the word in our lives a lovely little lady unadulterated untouched right perfect not touched by man-made creeds not touched by theology or theories or any of these other things that circle around you know so much of the time we we we we try to get our answers from Google and we try to Google something because Google always has the answer and Siri always has the answer we need to get back to the word and instead of looking out here for the answer of things look to the word because the word is what has our answer now so we we understand that when a woman becomes pregnant she has received seed and she has been pregnated and and and and and she begins to show forth that she's pregnant right man all of a sudden gets a little tiny baby bump I show you my baby bump and take a picture I always tuck it in right here he can't even tell but they're so excited they're so excited and as the belly gets bigger guess what my they start to pet that thing and rub it and talk to it my sweet little child it's in here how I love you now to The Outsider we think that they're admiring their belly but they're not admiring their belly they're admiring what's growing within their belly they're admiring the thought of a seed a son a daughter that's going to be born of them that's that's good that's going to be part of their family and they wonder who's he going to look like who's she going to look like who mannerisms are they going to be L and there's all these thoughts and and all these things that race through our minds but the desire of a pregnant person is not for them to stay pregnant forever just ask a woman that 9 months and 10 days [Applause] pregnant get this baby out I'm 10 days over I've waited nine months for this yeah let them go one day over they'll be trying everything get my feet rubbed EPs and salts whatever it may be everything that Google tells you to do my wife would always tell me a good back rub yeah she did she knew rightly that that wouldn't make the baby come but wisdom my wife has wisdom lots of it her desire isn't to stay pregnant but her desire is to bring forth the Manchild that's right so it is with every son or daughter of God our desire is not to just be pregnated of the word right but it's to give birth now to the word of God we realize that within us there may not be a baby or whatever but a natural type is spiritual but within us lays the very Life of Christ himself and so for order for that life to give birth it must manifest itself through us who are pregnated by it it's not just supposed to stay within here but it's supposed to work from the inside out a Christ child amen and that's what brother brandham is saying to us as children of the word of this age is that we are to bring forth not to just let it stay dormant but we are to bring forth the Manchild we are to bring forth the seed word child and that we're not just to let it stay there but we are to let it manifest itself through us the word must be manifested Ed can you say amen amen the unveiling of God Bram says your written Epistles read of all man I I translate that turn around this way see I want you all to turn to each other just turn it around you are Epistles that has been written go ahead and tell your neighbor go ahead yeah don't be shy you are an epistle that has been written that is going to be read of all men cuz you can't do nothing to it that's read of all men manifested word of God in other words so what are we supposed to be the manifestation of God himself am not for Wesley's age amen not for Luther's age right not for the Pentecostal age I tell you what to do put them all together cuz they're all part of the Capstone they're all part of the pyramid so when we put them all together at at the finishing of time guess what we've got we've got a completed full word because this seventh Church Angel uh Church age messenger he came to complete all things amen that's why he wasn't a six days messenger cuz that's the number of man but seven is the number of completion seven Church ages seven seals seven thiss seventh messenger what is he doing he has completed the work to the Gentile dispensation and the only thing that's left is the coming of the Lord himself it's completed so don't push it out but bring it in but when you bring it in put it in its rightful position amen don't get all caught up with putting stones and rocks in places where they don't belong right but when we put them where they belong when they put them in its correct order within the body and within our lives understand it's a complete circle it's a completed pyramid Hallelujah so now God's plan has always been that the word would manifest itself and that the word now would manifest itself through his bride for she is the only one who was capable of receiving the word in its fullness to bring it into full manifestation that's the bride she is the only one that's capable to receive the fullness of the word that she might produce the fullness of the word in her life as the musician come we'll bring this to a close like I've been saying we can preach about the word being made flesh and guess what we can all get excited right it's something worth getting excited over and we can say I believe that with all my heart and and the word being made manifest and the bride in this last day and hurrah hurrah harah and we can have ourselves a a big old Harrah time a big old a big old time at church where we all feel real good and we're saying yes I believe that's me I'm a complete manifestation of the word but what does the word look like when it's being manifested this is something that I would like to get into in future Services what does it look like when the word is being made flesh and dwelling amongst us because there's no doubt in our all of our Lives we want to be more like God and we want to be used of God if I were to say let me see a raise of hands of those of you that would love to be used of God more this week I'm sure both hands would be lifted and you would say father let me be used of you this week amen but but a lot of times being used of God doesn't go to what our perception of being used of God is come on so much of the time we think of being used of God is going and preaching the gospel and a lot of people giving their hearts to God and and there's a great time and a great time of repentance and I want to say that that's part of it when we think of being used of God we think of laying hands upon the a second and seeing that person recover or seeing that person have a miracle in our lives I want to say that that's part of it a lot of us think that it's speaking the word of God speak onto this mountain be thou removed from my life and it's removed that's part of it but I wonder is there other ways that God tries to use us in our lives that perhaps we see it as a trial perhaps we see it as a tribulation brother Mario went to the Philippines used of God mightily within the services but yet he tells us he had Financial [Music] issues he had this issue over here he went over there because there was something wrong with your property how was this being used of God I thought being used of God just produces blessings I thought being used of God just means that we're walking on cloud n all the time and when God speaks to us and tells us to do something we do it and and it's a great Hallelujah time and we're all excited and I wonder if God would cause your aortic thing there to split get trash foot cut your legs off fingers wonder if that's being used of God [Music] come on what a testimony the greatest trial of this man's life is going to turn into the greatest blessing for you and I when we hear of his testimony because we realize that what God has brought somebody else through he will also bring us through things amen I wonder if being used of God would cause us to I don't know be used of people that God would cause us but to pray for our very enemies the very people that are coming against you maybe family members children whatever it may be and you see it as a trial in your life but yet you're being used of God and when you're being used of God what's happening the word is being made [Music] flesh I wonder if being used of God means that you give grace and mercy words not deserved I wonder if being used of God means having patience for your brother whenever your patience is running out for him what is it it's the word being made flesh I wonder how many times in our lives lives that we have seen a trial and a tribulation and we've been tempted because we we bypassed or theophany and we've come to this flesh man to be tempted and we've been tempted by things where it be Financial family whatever the issues may be at some point we're all going to go through the same issues just some might be more severe than others but I wonder in that time of diversity in our lives is that really God speaking to us and saying now is your time to be the word made flesh this is your time for the seed word that I pregnated you with to make itself manifested amongst the people and Lou youa amongst the people in your family amongst the people at your work amongst the people at school where ever it may be this is your time but how's your reaction to what's happening in your life I want us to be very [Applause] aware that don't get being used of God put in a box where it just happens at church it just happens at the youth meeting it just happens the when you serve people no sometimes being used of God and the word becoming flesh is the time of the greatest turmoil in your life beautiful why because people are watching and they're watching our attitudes and they're watching how we deal with it and when they see how we've came through it though it may not have been nice though it may not have been joyful at the time but when we come out the other side we realize that God now was working this all together for his good according to the thoughts that he had within his mind hallelujah it's something to think about so this week as we go through the week be aware of what's happening in your life right be be aware of the circumstances be aware of the people that God places in your path be acutely aware of who God brings by your feet because perhaps God is going to use you no matter how they act or speak to you or no matter what the circumstance may be perhaps God is using that time to make himself manifested yeah that he still has Sons and Daughters upon this Earth who will stand by the word who have been born of the word who have been pregnated by the word and who are bringing the word to pass in their lives God bless you let's Stand [Music] Together amen let's all pray father Lord I Thank you for this very simple thought and Lord it no doubt is things that we have all heard before Lord and that we all know but Apostle pet Peter said that if you want to be a faithful Minister if you want to be a good Minister put them in remembrance of these things and so that's what we've done this morning Lord and I pray that you would let our Spirits be sensitized father to the moving of your spirit in our lives Lord that we might recognize our time to be the word made flesh father God I just love you with all of my heart and and these people that

their uh uh preeminence onto you father I pray convict that heart right now and I ask father God that you'd bring them back into that Sheepfold Lord don't let them go astray for we know that when a sheep goes astray by itself that it has no protection Lord but father may they come to their Shepherd Lord may they come to their Pastor here if they have a a question or a concern we know that our pastor is only a phone call away Lord and father God may they also go to that great Shepherd the Lord Jesus Christ for your rod and your staff Lord it comforts me Lord even when you correct us with it even when you put that hook around our neck Lord and it seems like we're ah being treated a little roughly Lord but father God you know what it does it Comforts us father as brother James spoke on the
