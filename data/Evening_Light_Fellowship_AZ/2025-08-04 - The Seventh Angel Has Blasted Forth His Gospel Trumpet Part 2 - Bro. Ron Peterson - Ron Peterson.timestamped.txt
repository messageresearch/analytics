[5:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you need him today?
[5:54] &gt;&gt; He's an everpresent help in the time of
[5:57] need. Yeah.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; It's more than a song. It's a
[5:59] relationship with him this morning.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; He loves to feel needed because he can
[6:06] supply our needs today.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; We got a couple of needs we would like
[6:11] to present to you this morning. Amen.
[6:14] Ask my son-in-law Ben if he'll come lead
[6:18] us in prayer this morning. Me and
[6:19] McGrady if you'll come lead us in
[6:21] prayer. Sister Pam Torres this morning
[6:24] says, "Please remember Sister Gloria in
[6:26] prayer. Barker. Sister Gloria has been
[6:28] having terrible headaches all week. And
[6:30] uh she said to remind the devil that
[6:33] he's a liar. So let's remember Sister
[6:35] Gloria, a very faithful saint here.
[6:37] Let's remember her this morning. We want
[6:39] to remember Sister Mary Anneus and their
[6:41] family and her. She's in hospice. May
[6:43] the Lord just be with her at this time.
[6:45] Uh Sister Maria Arasola would like us
[6:48] remember her daughters Rachel and
[6:49] Alicia. Uh they're going to Aaho Youth
[6:52] Camp with True Word Fellowship this
[6:54] weekend this week. So let's remember
[6:55] them for traveling mercies and the ones
[6:57] that are going to that camp this week.
[6:59] May the Lord be with them. Amen. All the
[7:02] ones that are traveling, let's remember
[7:03] them as they're traveling uh during this
[7:06] vacation season. We have two praise
[7:08] reports this morning. First from Sister
[7:10] Karen M. Uh we want to thank the Lord
[7:12] for what could have been a disaster. We
[7:15] were asleep around 11:30. Brother Neil
[7:18] heard our ice maker making a noise. Uh I
[7:21] went out there and tried to turn it off,
[7:22] but it wouldn't shut off. I smelled some
[7:24] burning, a burning smell. So, Brother
[7:26] Neil got up, tried to turn it off, and
[7:29] he'd seen sparks and smoke. And
[7:31] obviously, we unplugged it. If Brother
[7:34] Neil wouldn't have heard this, I suppose
[7:37] it would have caught fire. They want to
[7:39] thank the Lord for
[7:41] &gt;&gt; keeping his eye on them and keeping them
[7:43] safe during this. Could have been
[7:45] something big, but he made it small.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; What a caring God we have. We're so
[7:50] grateful for his loving arms around us.
[7:53] What a wonderful praise report this
[7:55] morning.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's a help.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Sister Veronica says this morning, I'd
[8:04] like to praise the and thank the Lord
[8:06] for answering my special prayer request
[8:08] on Friday. He answered and he gave me a
[8:10] good outcome and he's always so mindful.
[8:13] Even when I was unsure of what to do, uh
[8:16] he has seen me through. He is so good in
[8:18] all things. Thank you for your prayers,
[8:20] Sister Veronica. God bless you. Amen. Do
[8:22] you have a need today? If you do, let's
[8:24] sing it one more time as Ben comes and
[8:26] leads us in prayer today. I need you,
[8:29] Lord.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord,
[8:34] right now.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; We got a need lifted to him today.
[8:42] I need you, Lord.
[8:45] I need you, Lord.
[8:50] I lift my hands
[8:52] to you.
[8:54] Oh, I lift my hands
[8:58] and bow my knees.
[9:02] I worship
[9:05] your
[9:08] I need you, Lord.
[9:12] I need you, Lord.

[9:23] to be here in your house this morning
[9:25] and worship you and come and to receive
[9:28] from you this morning, Father. And first
[9:30] of all, we just uh want to pray for each
[9:32] one of these needs uh both uh written
[9:35] requests and unspoken requests. God, you
[9:37] know each need. You know exactly what uh
[9:40] everyone has need of, Father. And you're
[9:42] an ontime, present God. and we just come
[9:44] before you, Father. Asking that you
[9:46] would be here in our midst, Lord, and
[9:48] just let your presence and spirit come
[9:50] in our midst, God. Cuz Lord, we know
[9:53] that where you are, miracles take place,
[9:55] Father. And we're asking for each one of
[9:57] these needs, God. And asking, Lord, uh
[10:01] that you would just be with the
[10:02] ministering of the word today, Lord.
[10:04] That you would speak to our hearts, God.
[10:06] Let us not just be hearers, but doers of
[10:08] the word and prepare our hearts, God, to
[10:10] receive from you. Father, we want to
[10:12] give uh you the praise and honor and
[10:14] glory for the uh the testimonies this
[10:18] morning. And God, we also believe in
[10:20] that there will be testimonies coming
[10:21] out of this service. Father, we just ask
[10:24] God that you will anoint the music, the
[10:26] the worship, Father, and anoint us as as
[10:30] uh listeners, God, and let us uh enter
[10:34] into your atmosphere and your presence,
[10:36] God. And just let your spirit be with us
[10:38] this morning, Father. We just ask all
[10:40] this in the name of Jesus. Amen.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you shake your
[10:45] neighbor's hand and welcome to the house
[10:46] of the Lord this morning, Billy Silva
[10:49] has a friend Isaac here, another
[10:50] coworker of his. I want to welcome Isaac
[10:52] here with us today. Amen. Brother Mark
[10:55] Stany, if you'll come forward, he's got
[10:57] an announcement. Uh junior youth meeting
[11:00] today at Justin and Jenny Dubsky's house
[11:02] and that's at 5:30. That's Junior Youth
[11:04] 5:30 uh at their house. And we also have
[11:08] an announcement to make and I think we
[11:10] have some pictures as well. But we would
[11:12] like to congratulate Carissa Chavez and
[11:15] her fiance Noah Smith. They are engaged
[11:19] now and we want to congratulate them and
[11:21] may the Lord honor their footsteps and
[11:24] guide their hands. But we want to
[11:25] congratulate you on your engagement to
[11:27] Noah. So God bless them. Let's give them
[11:30] a round of applause.
[11:32] Amen.
[11:35] Amen. Brother Mark, if you'll go away
[11:37] and give your announcement.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; And just real quickly, just want to take
[11:41] a few moments. Hard to believe we're
[11:43] into August already. A lot of our
[11:45] children are going back to school. And
[11:46] of course, that means Sunday school is
[11:48] just around the corner. And as we do
[11:50] every year, Sunday school will start the
[11:52] Sunday right after Labor Day this year.
[11:54] That's on September the 7th. And we do
[11:57] have an announcement on the bulletin
[11:58] board over on the Sunday school site. If
[12:00] you want more information about Sunday
[12:01] school, please see that announcement. Uh
[12:04] we do have three classes, ages 3 to 5,
[12:07] ages 6 to 8, and then ages 9 to 11. Uh
[12:11] we start 9:20 over here in we have them
[12:14] singing in the senior youth room and
[12:17] that lasts about 15 minutes and they're
[12:19] dismissed to their classrooms and
[12:20] they're usually back here in time for
[12:23] the preaching of the word. So just
[12:25] looking forward to what the Lord's going
[12:26] to do for our Sunday school this year.
[12:28] But we're doing just a something a
[12:29] little bit different this year. We've
[12:31] had a little bit of change in classroom
[12:33] sizes and we've got new families that
[12:35] have come. And so what we're asking
[12:37] everyone to do this year, even if you've
[12:39] been in Sunday school before, we have
[12:40] reg or I don't want to call them
[12:42] registration forms, but information
[12:44] forms and they're on the Bolton board
[12:45] over here. And we'd like each family to
[12:47] go ahead and complete that. It just asks
[12:49] for your family name, your child's name,
[12:51] or if you have more than one, you can
[12:53] put them on the back. Uh date of birth,
[12:55] your parents' name. We sometimes get new
[12:57] families drop children off. We don't
[12:58] know who the children belong to. So, we
[13:00] just get the parents names and a contact
[13:02] phone number if we need to get a hold of
[13:04] you during the week or something. And
[13:06] one other question here, but does your
[13:08] child have any food allergies? We
[13:09] sometimes have snacks for the children.
[13:12] And so, if your child has an allergy of
[13:13] some po some some sort, we'd like to
[13:15] know about that. So, if you could do
[13:17] that, once you complete that, if you
[13:18] give that to one of the deacons and then
[13:20] the deacons will get that to us or if
[13:22] you run into me, you can always hand
[13:23] that to me as well. Um, I think that's
[13:26] pretty well all I've got. Uh, we did not
[13:29] get a chance to present the Sunday
[13:31] school offering to brother Ron yet this
[13:33] year for this last Sunday school year,
[13:34] but I did count that up and the children
[13:37] gave $44345.
[13:41] So, we'll be giving that to brother Ron
[13:42] to do with as he sees fit. I think he
[13:44] still has the offering from last year as
[13:46] well that he was going to allocate and
[13:47] that was about $461.
[13:50] I think in the last three years the
[13:52] children have given between 11 and
[13:53] $1,200. So, just want to thank the of
[13:56] course you as parents have a big part to
[13:58] do with that, but just want to thank all
[13:59] of the all of the children for
[14:01] faithfully giving. It's a joy to watch
[14:03] them dig in their little purses for
[14:05] their their change every every Sunday
[14:07] morning. But if you'd be in prayer for
[14:09] the Sunday school this year, I know we
[14:10] have regular meetings for the junior
[14:12] youth and the Sunday or the senior
[14:14] youth, but uh Sunday school happens each
[14:16] and every Sunday. We go September
[14:18] through May and appreciate each of our
[14:20] teachers and all the helpers. And most
[14:22] of all, we would appreciate your
[14:23] prayers. Amen.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you a blessed people this
[14:30] morning?
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Count your blessings. Name them one by
[14:34] one. We thought about this song
[14:35] yesterday. A lot of people are looking
[14:36] at the trials they go through.

[14:41] &gt;&gt; because we are a blessed people this
[14:43] morning. Amen. Put your hands together

[16:12] it up with your hands at home,
[16:16] think that Christ has promised you on

[24:53] bedroom. And last night is the first
[24:55] time that she walked um with Randy in
[24:59] front of her, my brother, and then her
[25:01] dad was behind her with the wheelchair
[25:04] and she walked the full length of the
[25:05] parallel bars and then she was real weak
[25:08] and she had to sit down on this. That's
[25:09] just such a positive care. So, um thank
[25:13] you for all your prayers and just please
[25:15] continue to keep her in your prayers in
[25:18] the days ahead as she's, you know,
[25:20] getting stronger and stronger. Amen.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you.

[36:18] Uh we
[36:20] have a baby dedication this morning and
[36:24] so we want to sing that song. Bring them
[36:26] in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones
[36:29] to Jesus as Ethan and Hannah Stany come.
[36:33] And I'd like to ask the the grandparents
[36:35] if they would like to come and uh be
[36:38] with us up here as we dedicate this uh
[36:41] new little love gift to uh the Stanky
[36:45] family. Yes. Bring them in.
[36:50] Bring them in.
[36:54] Bring them in from the fields of sin.
[37:00] Bring them in.
[37:04] Bring them in.
[37:07] Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[37:12] [Music]
[37:16] Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on over here. Come on up a
[37:23] little closer. Yeah. Yeah. Praise the
[37:26] Lord.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; This is all part of the cycle of life,
[37:33] &gt;&gt; youth meetings,
[37:35] infatuation,
[37:39] engagement,
[37:40] marriage, children, dedication. Amen.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Because what he does, he gives you love
[37:48] gifts.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; He takes a couple and he makes them a a
[37:53] family by giving them little children.
[37:55] And that's such a great responsibility
[37:57] because he said, "Take these little
[37:59] children that I give you and raise them
[38:01] up in nurture and admonition of God." We
[38:05] thank God for our Sunday school teachers
[38:06] and stuff because they have a part to do
[38:08] in all of this because prior to even
[38:12] them understanding what we're preaching
[38:15] in here, they preached to them in the
[38:18] back classrooms and we bless our Sunday
[38:21] school teachers and and everything and
[38:24] uh we're just very very pleased. Let me
[38:27] read the scriptures, then we'll take the
[38:29] baby.
[38:34] The Bible says
[38:38] in Matthew 18, "And they brought unto
[38:41] him also infants that he should touch
[38:45] them. But when his disciples saw it,
[38:48] they rebuked them. But Jesus called unto
[38:52] him unto him, and suffer little children
[38:57] to come unto me, and forbid them not,
[39:00] for of such is the kingdom of God.
[39:03] Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall
[39:06] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[39:09] little child shall in no wise enter
[39:13] therein.
[39:16] Now, we do not baptize infants
[39:19] &gt;&gt; because they have not come to the age of
[39:22] accountability. Now, the prophet of God,
[39:25] his teaching on that was because I had
[39:28] someone ask over the internet just a few
[39:31] days ago, brother Ron, what was the
[39:32] prophet's teaching of age of
[39:34] accountability? And he said, up to about
[39:38] 12 years of age. Now, some mature faster
[39:42] than others. That's true mentally,
[39:44] physically. But I want to say he said it
[39:47] was about 12 years of age, age of
[39:49] accountability. And prior to that, if a
[39:52] child were to die,
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said all babies and
[39:56] children prior to that age of
[39:58] accountability go to heaven.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? Talk about God's
[40:02] love.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; God's love. Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; And so
[40:09] his teaching was that what you do is you
[40:11] take these little children and you
[40:12] dedicate them to the Lord, okay? And you
[40:16] name them names that are going to have
[40:18] an effect. He said, "Stay away from
[40:21] Ricky and Elvis and different things
[40:23] because they've got a a bad meaning."
[40:26] But you have chosen some names here and
[40:29] we're going to read those names. And
[40:33] they have chosen to name this little son
[40:36] August Grant
[40:39] Stanky. August means consecrated and
[40:43] venerable.
[40:44] I said, "But he was born in July."
[40:48] He said, "No, brother Ron." He said,
[40:50] "August is actually a is it a family
[40:52] name from your grandfather? It goes back
[40:55] quite quite a a ways." So, we thank God
[40:58] for that. You named it August,
[41:00] consecrated, venerable,
[41:03] and grant means great and to bestow and
[41:08] to be given blessings.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; So consecrated
[41:14] to be great and bestowed
[41:17] &gt;&gt; many blessings.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; And it also means tall. So hopefully
[41:25] that helps.
[41:27] Now, that's that's what he wrote. I
[41:29] didn't say that.
[41:33] Hopefully, that helps.
[41:36] For Moses said, "Consecrate yourselves
[41:39] today to the Lord, even every man, upon
[41:43] his son, and upon his brother, that he
[41:45] may bestow upon him a blessing this
[41:48] day."
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's Exodus 32:29.
[41:52] And our prayer, this is what they wrote
[41:54] down. Our prayer for August is that his
[41:58] life be consecrated unto God and blessed
[42:02] throughout his life.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Wow. What a
[42:06] &gt;&gt; a great request
[42:08] &gt;&gt; that these parents have asked.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; And so we're going to take this little
[42:12] child now.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Can you turn him?
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There we go.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[42:25] Get a photo here.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[42:37] Let's just bow our heads and our hearts.
[42:44] Heavenly Father, as I hold in my arms,
[42:47] August Grant Stanky,
[42:51] one whose life is consecrated
[42:55] &gt;&gt; that he might be bestowed many
[42:57] blessings.
[42:58] I pray you, heavenly father, that you
[43:01] will bless this young son.
[43:04] May he grow up to be in the stature of a
[43:08] perfect man according to thy word. I
[43:11] pray, Father, that you will bless
[43:14] Brother Ethan, Sister Hannah, as you've
[43:18] given this little love gift. May they
[43:20] watch over him, teach him, and tell him
[43:24] about the great things of God and the
[43:27] price you paid for our sins. And that
[43:30] you've given the good gift unto his
[43:33] children. So, Father, I pray now as I
[43:37] dedicate him back to you for a life of
[43:40] service,
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Ethan,
[43:44] I consecrate you now
[43:48] and dedicate you back to him who gave
[43:51] you life.
[43:53] The parents conceived,
[43:56] but you gave life,
[43:58] the breath of life. Father, I pray that
[44:01] you will bless him all the days of his
[44:04] life. Lord, watch over him. Keep him
[44:07] safe and secure. Father, in an evil and
[44:11] dark generation that is uh bombarded
[44:15] with all kinds of things to try to
[44:18] deceive and to take away and to hinder
[44:22] the things of God. I pray watch over his
[44:25] little hands what they touch his feet
[44:28] where they go. His ears what they hear,
[44:31] his eyes what they see. May you, Father,
[44:35] watch over him and keep him close to you
[44:39] is our prayer. We dedicate August Grant
[44:42] Stani back to you for a life of service
[44:45] now in Jesus Christ's name.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Do you grandparents say amen to that?
[44:53] Huh? Yeah. Yeah. All right.
[44:57] Praise the Lord. All right.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; What was that?
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We dedicated you guys a few months
[45:07] ago, wasn't it?
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That we're all getting old. God
[45:10] bless you. Watch your step here. Watch
[45:12] your step. God bless you. Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I wanted to say
[45:21] congratulations to Sister Clarissa, too,
[45:24] and the Chavez family that uh they have
[45:28] an engagement. And uh
[45:31] Noah's going to be moving here, right?
[45:34] Or are you going to go there? I think
[45:37] you're going there. You know, the
[45:39] scripture says that the woman goes where
[45:40] the man is, but uh we're kind of we
[45:44] guard over our youth and we'd like to
[45:47] have them all here, but we all
[45:48] understand that that doesn't happen all
[45:51] the time. Amen. And praise the Lord for
[45:54] the the praise report of Sister Lori
[45:59] &gt;&gt; for her to pay to take a few steps right
[46:01] now. If you knew the situation
[46:03] medically, what the doctor said,
[46:06] &gt;&gt; okay, that that is a miracle in itself
[46:08] that she's taken a few steps. May this
[46:11] be the first of many and may she go come
[46:14] back come back to a complete
[46:16] restoration,
[46:18] &gt;&gt; walking on her own.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; We just ask God to do that. We thank God
[46:22] also to brother Kelly McMillan. Now,
[46:25] it's been about almost four weeks since
[46:28] his uh operation. So this four weeks
[46:31] posttop and he had throat cancer and
[46:35] they took part of the back part of the
[46:38] tongue. He said they cut him down on
[46:39] both sides of the cheek under the chin.
[46:42] did all this operation and um they did a
[46:46] study where he took some uh radioactive
[46:50] ingredient to drink it and they took a
[46:52] picture of him being able to swallow and
[46:56] they said that things aren't functioning
[46:58] the way they would and one doctor said
[47:01] you may never eat or drink again
[47:04] and I uh spoke to brother Kelly
[47:08] yesterday and he's listening right now
[47:11] very faithful brother in Christ. And
[47:15] I told him, I said, "Blessed are they
[47:17] who hunger and thirst." And I said, "And
[47:20] but you've got that spiritually." But I
[47:22] said, I I said, "Now, we're asking God
[47:26] for a miracle. The doctors say you may
[47:29] never Well, hey, listen. They say you
[47:31] can never walk. You can never whatever.
[47:34] Hey, listen. We don't have to take the
[47:36] doctor the doctor's prognosis. So we can
[47:38] say we have a higher court of appeal.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; We go there and by faith
[47:44] &gt;&gt; we call those things that are not
[47:47] &gt;&gt; as though they are.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're just praying you. You
[47:56] pray with me
[47:57] &gt;&gt; that we'll see in the next couple days.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; A miracle to happen in brother Kelly to
[48:03] be able to eat and drink once again.
[48:05] He's lost about 80 pounds.
[48:08] uh being fed through the nose and then
[48:10] they're doing a port in the stomach
[48:12] right now and everything. But hey,
[48:14] listen, that's not the way God intended
[48:17] us to be fed.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Huh? So, we're just asking God for a
[48:21] miracle. Let's stand together.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[48:36] Open the eyes of my heart.
[48:40] I want to see you.
[48:46] I want to see you. Open the eyes.
[48:53] Open the eyes of my heart. Oh,
[48:58] open the eyes of my heart.
[49:03] I want to see you.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; I want to see you. To
[49:11] &gt;&gt; see you high and lifted up. To see you
[49:15] high and lifted up.
[49:21] Shining in the light of your glory.
[49:27] All around your power and love.
[49:31] We sing holy, holy, holy.
[49:40] I want to see you.
[49:45] I want to see you,
[49:50] &gt;&gt; heavenly father.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; We have an open book before us.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; As we have opened your holy scripture,
[50:01] And yet we know that though one might
[50:04] have the education and the understanding
[50:08] to be able to read, to write,
[50:12] but Father God, it takes the opening of
[50:15] the understanding of our mind and of our
[50:19] spirit that we might see the things of
[50:22] God.
[50:23] For the education of this world does not
[50:26] unlock your mysteries, nor your love,
[50:29] nor your redemption. Therefore, Father,
[50:32] I'm asking by the supernatural element
[50:35] of the opening of our understanding by
[50:38] way of the Holy Spirit, would you come
[50:41] make the scriptures real to us?
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Make it alive.
[50:46] And Father, once we see it, may it
[50:48] become a manifestation in our life. Yes.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; I thank you and I praise you. Bless each
[50:53] and everyone that is here. Those by way
[50:56] of internet, those by way of archive,
[50:59] &gt;&gt; however they hear the word of God,
[51:02] &gt;&gt; I thank you. We even have a brother who
[51:04] streams our services
[51:07] uh very faithfully and he's blind,
[51:11] &gt;&gt; but he streams and he hears.
[51:14] And so, Father, I pray that you will
[51:16] bless him too abundantly.
[51:18] father as we just met him here just a
[51:21] few weeks ago up north there in Oregon
[51:26] and he stood there on the second row. He
[51:29] said, "Brother Ron, I've listened
[51:32] faithfully
[51:34] for years, but this is the first time
[51:37] I've ever met you." Father, I pray
[51:42] &gt;&gt; bless our brother
[51:44] &gt;&gt; and those Father that hear the word of
[51:47] God. Bless this congregation, this group
[51:51] of sheep, Father, that you have placed
[51:54] under our leadership.
[51:56] May my leadership be your leadership.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; May it not be my interpretation. May it
[52:03] be your interpretation.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; May it not be my viewpoint, but your
[52:08] viewpoint.
[52:09] Father, come now and speak to us from
[52:13] thy word. I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians. God
[52:21] bless you each and everyone. Remain
[52:23] standing if you'd like to turn with me
[52:25] into the book of Joel chapter 2 and
[52:29] chapter 3. Joel chapter 2 15 and 16.
[52:41] Joel
[52:43] chapter 2 verse 15.
[52:46] Blow the trumpet in Zion.
[52:49] Sanctify a fast.
[52:52] Call a solemn assembly.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Gather the people.
[52:58] Sanctify the congregation. Assemble the
[53:00] elders.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Gather the children and those that suck
[53:04] the breast. Let the bridegroom go forth
[53:08] of his chamber and the bride out of her
[53:12] closet.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; So as he comes forth from his chamber,
[53:16] she comes forth from the closet.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; So we see that this is all connected
[53:23] together with this blowing of a trumpet.
[53:28] Amen. Joel 3:es
[53:32] 9-14.
[53:38] Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles.
[53:44] Prepare war.
[53:46] Wake up the mighty men. Let all the men
[53:49] of war draw near.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Let them come up.
[53:53] Beat your plowshares into swords and
[53:56] your pruning hooks into spears.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, I am strong. Assemble
[54:04] yourselves and come all ye heathen, and
[54:08] ye gather yourselves together round
[54:11] about. Thither cause thy mighty ones to
[54:15] come down, O Lord. Let the heathen be
[54:18] awakened and come up to the valley of
[54:20] Jehoshaphat. For there will there will I
[54:24] set in the judge all the heathen
[54:26] roundabout.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Put ye in the sickle for the harvest is
[54:30] ripe. Come get you down for the press is
[54:34] full. The fats overflow for their
[54:37] wickedness is great. Multitudes,
[54:40] multitudes in the valley of decision.
[54:44] The sun and the moon shall be darkened,
[54:47] and the stars shall withdraw their
[54:49] shining, and the Lord also shall roar
[54:53] out of Zion, and utter his voice from
[54:57] Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth
[54:59] shall shake, but the Lord will be the
[55:04] hope of his people, and the strength of
[55:06] the children
[55:08] of Israel. May God bless the reading of
[55:11] his word. You all may be seated this
[55:13] morning in the presence of God.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to title my sermon this
[55:25] morning. The seventh angel
[55:28] has past tense has blasted forth his
[55:33] gospel trumpet.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is part two and I want to
[55:38] take the direction this morning or the
[55:40] subject of come out of her my people.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Now, as we as message believers,
[55:56] I want to
[55:58] to take and expound on some things this
[56:01] morning.
[56:03] uh
[56:05] that we might understand a little bit
[56:07] more about why God sends a prophet in
[56:10] this age
[56:12] and with the revealing of the word that
[56:15] it causes spiritual conflict.
[56:19] Brother Brennham says when a seal opens
[56:22] it declares war. Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Now, it says there in the book of Joel,
[56:29] "Proclaim ye the ye this among the
[56:32] Gentiles, prepare war."
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; So, there must be a preparation because
[56:38] if you're unprepared, you'll be
[56:40] conquered.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; If you're not understanding of what kind
[56:44] of spiritual warfare you're in,
[56:47] &gt;&gt; you can be conquered.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And we know that there is a system, a
[56:53] religious system that is rising up and
[56:58] it is called, brother Brennham said,
[57:00] denomination.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; It's organized religion.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And that is coming and
[57:08] trying to anoint and deceive many to
[57:12] come into a world council of churches."
[57:15] It may seem like it's innocent, may seem
[57:18] like it's okay. And what difference does
[57:20] it make as long as we all claim that
[57:24] we're all part of this great movement of
[57:27] God and really God is the center of the
[57:29] wheel and all of the spokes of the
[57:32] different religions that come and and
[57:35] the center is God anyway. It doesn't
[57:37] matter whether you're Baptist,
[57:38] Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal. It
[57:41] doesn't really matter. Or does it?
[57:47] For Jesus said, "I am the way,
[57:50] &gt;&gt; the truth, and the life, and no man
[57:53] comes to the father but by me."
[57:55] &gt;&gt; So God in sending a prophet,
[57:59] his ministry
[58:01] was to declare that there is a spiritual
[58:03] war on
[58:05] &gt;&gt; and we need to know how to fight the
[58:08] good fight
[58:10] &gt;&gt; because you know what? seducing spirits,
[58:12] spirits of fornication and adultery and
[58:15] seducing clergy spirits and all kinds of
[58:18] things have come in. And it started in
[58:20] the first church age after God sends the
[58:23] Holy Spirit, gets the church in order um
[58:27] according to Acts chapter 2. And then
[58:29] Peter stands up on that great day, men
[58:32] and brethren, what must we do to be
[58:34] saved? And he says, repent and be
[58:36] baptized. So he begins to enter into the
[58:40] church by giving direction of what you
[58:43] need to do to be saved.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; God doesn't change.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[58:50] forever. And if what he instituted back
[58:54] then and if he's the same yesterday,
[58:57] today, and forever, then we can see what
[58:59] he's done to know what he will do.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Because the past declares the future.
[59:06] Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Now,
[59:11] um I want you to understand that
[59:14] everyone welcomed the prophetic ministry
[59:18] of Malachi 4 up until the opening of the
[59:21] seals
[59:24] &gt;&gt; because the vast majority of places
[59:26] where he preached because there weren't
[59:28] message churches,
[59:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:30] &gt;&gt; There were denominations, Baptist,
[59:33] Methodist, Pentecostal, whatever. And
[59:35] they were all inviting him because they
[59:38] saw a great grip gift. And as Moses was
[59:41] given two signs,
[59:43] &gt;&gt; you're going to be given two signs. So
[59:45] you do this to get the attention. It's
[59:48] an attraction.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Getting the attention. No man can do
[59:53] these things except that God be with
[59:55] him.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; So now he was given the sign in the hand
[59:59] and the gift of discernment to get the
[1:00:02] attention of the people. But that's not
[1:00:05] what caught elected
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; caught their attention.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; But I'm interested what catches seed.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; I'm interested on what catches the soul
[1:00:16] of a person and causes them to be
[1:00:18] different.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And so I wish to declare to
[1:00:24] you some things this morning that might
[1:00:28] be a little bit different, but just bear
[1:00:30] with me
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; because I want you to understand what
[1:00:34] part of this beast system
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; do you want to be a part of?
[1:00:43] What part of the Antichrist system are
[1:00:46] you going to allow and say it really
[1:00:48] doesn't matter when we're all one?
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; What makes us different?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Why do we gather?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; What makes us different than
[1:01:00] denominations?
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Because the rain falls on the just and
[1:01:04] the unjust.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Don't they both rise up and and praise
[1:01:08] God together? So, I'm not talking about
[1:01:10] anointing. I'm not talking about signs
[1:01:11] and wonders. I'm not talking about
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; doctrinal teachings. I'm not talking
[1:01:17] about uh healing the sick because the
[1:01:21] prophet's ministry was not just on
[1:01:25] majoring on minors.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Majoring on minors.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; He says that's just the first and second
[1:01:36] pull. That's the attraction. Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; And he says, "What catches him?" Watch
[1:01:41] the change of ministry.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; And it happened in the days of Jesus
[1:01:47] Christ.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; When he began to say, "Except you eat of
[1:01:53] my flesh and drink of my blood, you have
[1:01:55] no part with me."
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And many of his
[1:01:59] disciples were offended and they walked
[1:02:02] no more with him."
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Now, he did not become apologetic. He
[1:02:06] did not go after them. He didn't say,
[1:02:08] "I'm sorry. Excuse me. I need to kind of
[1:02:11] tell you it's not really my flesh and
[1:02:13] it's not my blood." He didn't do that.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; In fact, he said, "Does this offend you
[1:02:17] to the even those that were still with
[1:02:20] him?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on,
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Peter.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Why don't you go also?
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Where could we go?"
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; So, there was a change in the ministry.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; And if I could say this, it was a
[1:02:34] purging. That's right.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; God is separating
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; back then as he is today
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; the shuck from the wheat.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; There's got to be come out from among
[1:02:46] them.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; You've got to understand this ministry.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; So listen carefully.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; With the opening of the seals,
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; it is the total exposure of the spirit
[1:03:02] behind organized religion.
[1:03:08] Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; It's the system, not the people.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Good people in each one of
[1:03:17] them."
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to give you some very
[1:03:19] astounding quotes
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; of what the prophet of God said.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And how that your
[1:03:26] ignorance today will be no court of
[1:03:28] appeal if you miss the rapture."
[1:03:30] I'm going to show you some of these
[1:03:31] quotes
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; because I believe saints of God, what
[1:03:35] happened when we when we look at the
[1:03:38] message of the hour, I don't want you to
[1:03:40] to it's like the pieces to a jigsaw
[1:03:44] puzzle.
[1:03:47] When a couple pieces put together, it
[1:03:50] doesn't give you the complete picture.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; So, you don't sit there and study, well,
[1:03:54] yeah, okay, this fit perfectly together.
[1:03:57] Yeah, but what about all the other
[1:03:58] pieces?
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; You know, the border is easy to do
[1:04:03] because each side has got a square edge
[1:04:06] or a straight edge.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; So, a lot of times we put the border
[1:04:11] together and then we do the filling.
[1:04:14] I want you to understand that sometimes
[1:04:16] what we do is we as message believers
[1:04:18] have a tendency to micro focus on one
[1:04:22] piece to the puzzle
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; and don't stand back and look at a great
[1:04:26] overview. Oh my,
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; look at this. From 1947
[1:04:32] until 1965,
[1:04:34] actually go back in 1933, behold as John
[1:04:37] the Baptist and the introduction and all
[1:04:40] of this,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And we begin now to look as an overview.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that the
[1:04:48] prophet when he names sermons and gives
[1:04:51] them titles,
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; it is a sermon in itself.
[1:04:57] When he gives you a question, who do you
[1:05:00] say this is?
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Sir, is this the sign of the end?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; What is this attraction?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Who is this?
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Melzdc.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; He's making a declaration during his
[1:05:13] sermon for you to find the answer.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; It's an open book test.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Open book tests are the hardest
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; because Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All I know
[1:05:24] it's it's somewhere. Yeah. Let me see. I
[1:05:25] wrote it down uh years ago. I remember
[1:05:28] Yeah. Where where is that? And you spend
[1:05:30] all your time listen
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; that and thy word, oh Lord, have I hid
[1:05:37] in my heart that I learn not to sin
[1:05:39] against you.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It's not just head knowledge. Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; But it it it's a documentation of his
[1:05:46] word there that when you do a query or a
[1:05:50] search
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; in your life, if you do not have it on
[1:05:54] your hard drive,
[1:05:56] it says doesn't compute, doesn't come
[1:05:59] up,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; invalidatory search.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand when you go
[1:06:04] to church, you young people listen to
[1:06:07] this. When you go to church, you're
[1:06:08] hearing the word. It's logging into your
[1:06:11] mind. Jesus said, "My words are spirit
[1:06:15] and they are life."
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And so you begin to see that you hear
[1:06:20] the word. Faith cometh by hearing,
[1:06:24] hearing the word of God. So you go to
[1:06:26] church, you hear the word, you read your
[1:06:28] Bible, you read the word, you listen to
[1:06:31] a sermon. All of that is the word coming
[1:06:34] forth. But that only brings forth
[1:06:36] knowledge.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Yeah.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Okay. It gives you some kind of a
[1:06:43] um an understanding
[1:06:46] but it doesn't reveal the mystery of the
[1:06:49] scripture.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; So we need the Holy Spirit
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; to make it alive to us because the
[1:06:56] letter kleth
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; but the spirit giveth life. Amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; So now watch the opening of the seals
[1:07:04] now
[1:07:06] revealed
[1:07:08] mystery Babylon
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; the mother
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Unclean woman.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand
[1:07:20] religion is just a covering.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; It's a man-made covering.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; We don't want religion. We want a
[1:07:29] relationship.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; And so you begin to understand that this
[1:07:35] system has began to work when the white
[1:07:38] horse rider went forth going forth to
[1:07:41] conquer and to con conquering and to
[1:07:44] conquer.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; What is he doing? He's giving out his
[1:07:48] doctrine.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; It really doesn't matter. We're all one.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; God is changing. He's with his church
[1:07:55] and not with his word. and so so on and
[1:07:58] so forth. So now for for the seven
[1:08:01] church ages, we've seen now how the
[1:08:05] devil has wanted to come in and to send
[1:08:09] in his interpretation,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; send in his ideas.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; And he wants to dilute the word of God.
[1:08:18] And once that happens in every age and
[1:08:21] that church goes off into apostasy, goes
[1:08:24] in with truth, rejects truth, goes off
[1:08:27] into apostasy, and the next thing you
[1:08:29] know, God has to send another messenger.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Ephesus, Samrna, it on on until right
[1:08:36] down to this very age. So now we had
[1:08:39] here the prophet born 1909. This church
[1:08:42] age started 1906. So it was already it
[1:08:46] started because of the glosselia or the
[1:08:49] Holy Spirit coming down
[1:08:52] anointing the gifts over there in
[1:08:54] California called the Isusa street
[1:08:56] revival.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; And it began to start a Pentecostal
[1:09:00] movement and it was God and and and God
[1:09:04] manifesting
[1:09:05] uh the fruits of the spirit and so on.
[1:09:08] But it, brother Brennham said it was
[1:09:10] just a few years until they already
[1:09:12] began to divide
[1:09:15] and have their own interpretation. And
[1:09:17] he says really, he said, what'll happen,
[1:09:21] the further you get away from the
[1:09:23] revival and by the time the fourth
[1:09:26] generation comes along, there's just a
[1:09:28] few glowing embers
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; of the original revival. Right.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that his
[1:09:38] ministry had to change.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, it did.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says there's coming a
[1:09:44] change. You all know it's been
[1:09:45] prophesied.
[1:09:47] He says back uh in with the first sermon
[1:09:52] that he caught the vision of what is the
[1:09:55] third pope
[1:09:58] and he titles it what is a vision? And
[1:10:01] he says,"I begin to see in fishing and
[1:10:04] little fish and a baby shoe and trying
[1:10:07] to this and that." And he said, "Don't
[1:10:09] try to teach Pentecostal
[1:10:11] PE babies supernatural things."
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; And so we see the tent, the cathedral,
[1:10:20] and why in there, why that little room,
[1:10:23] etc., etc. Now, remember, all of these
[1:10:25] are symbols. Yeah.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; God's word is
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; symbols.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; The parables of God within the scripture
[1:10:36] are symbols. And the kingdom of heaven
[1:10:38] is likened unto a man who swed seed.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Some fell in thorny ground. So on and so
[1:10:44] forth. All of those are symbols, are
[1:10:46] they not?
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have to understand the
[1:10:49] prophet of God said watch the symbols
[1:10:53] and keep them correctly otherwise you'll
[1:10:55] get the cow on top of the tree and he
[1:10:59] never says chewing grass he says picking
[1:11:01] grass.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; So you never get that quote by saying
[1:11:05] the cow on top of the tree chewing
[1:11:07] grass.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; It's picking grass.
[1:11:10] Now since the opening of the seals, the
[1:11:13] denominational spirit among message
[1:11:17] believers
[1:11:18] began to close their doors and they said
[1:11:23] the prophet is no longer welcome to
[1:11:25] preach in their churches.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Bobby McGary is a prime example of that
[1:11:32] with his pastor over there in Shreveport
[1:11:35] who was a great supporter of the prophet
[1:11:40] and had brother Brennham come to the
[1:11:43] meetings. But it was there that brother
[1:11:46] Brennham
[1:11:48] uh was going to he was taking a series
[1:11:50] of meetings and I forget brother Bobby
[1:11:52] what sermons it was but he was there in
[1:11:54] Shreveport and he was at the motel room
[1:11:59] and the local pastor had said he sent
[1:12:02] his some of his board members to go to
[1:12:06] the motel and tell brother Brennham he's
[1:12:08] no longer welcome.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Tell them to not bother coming to
[1:12:12] service tonight. But they couldn't find
[1:12:14] his room.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; do you think God was in that?
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Couldn't find his room. Couldn't tell
[1:12:22] him he couldn't come.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:12:26] I want you to understand some of these
[1:12:29] that were great supporters
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; at one time now close their doors.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So now, Brother Brennham sits down
[1:12:38] in Tucson without any invitations for 18
[1:12:43] months or three years. He says it a
[1:12:45] couple ways
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; each time. But I want you to understand,
[1:12:48] he's no longer welcome.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; In fact, Brother Billy Paul told me, he
[1:12:52] said, um, the denomination said, "I'll
[1:12:55] tell you what. We will have you come and
[1:12:57] you can come to the meetings and perform
[1:13:00] your sign, do the discerning of hearts
[1:13:03] and do miracles and then when you get
[1:13:06] done, turn the service over to uh the
[1:13:09] learned ministry and let us preach
[1:13:12] because you're ignorant and unlearned.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; All they were interested in was the
[1:13:21] signs.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; The signs were an attraction. Right.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; It was the change of ministry of the
[1:13:27] revealing of the son of man in this hour
[1:13:31] that caught the seed.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; You might have been in all kinds of
[1:13:35] denominations.
[1:13:37] You might have been a Catholic. You
[1:13:40] might have been Pentecostal. You might
[1:13:42] have been in some kind of denomination
[1:13:45] of organized religion. May I call it
[1:13:49] this so that you'll understand Jezebel
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; religion
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; or a church that was full of blasphemous
[1:13:59] names
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; do you understand?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Don't let this offend you.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Take it for what it's worth and
[1:14:07] understand what was this prophet's
[1:14:10] ministry to do.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; He was not to just tell us how to go to
[1:14:16] church.
[1:14:17] or how to dress. That's a part of it.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; But if that's all you get out of it, you
[1:14:23] become a religion.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm sorry to say, there are
[1:14:27] religious denominations within this
[1:14:30] message already because they've gone no
[1:14:32] further.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And so all they do is preach the
[1:14:36] legalism of how to dress and what to do
[1:14:38] and how to go to church when there is
[1:14:40] something far greater.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's step back and look at the
[1:14:45] overview.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; So this exposure
[1:14:54] with the opening of the word now rips
[1:14:58] off the mask of the system which is
[1:15:02] deceiving the people
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; and it's doing it even today.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; It is a system that is rising up.
[1:15:11] Remember there was one that came out of
[1:15:13] the earth.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; And one come out of the sea.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And this last one he said now watch. It
[1:15:21] started like a lamb. Revelations 13.
[1:15:25] He said it started like a lamb.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Looked innocent.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; But pretty soon it took on the image of
[1:15:32] the beast and it spake with the power of
[1:15:35] a dragon.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said, "What nation
[1:15:40] is that?"
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; America. Revelation chapter 13, America.
[1:15:46] 13 stars, 13 stripes, 13 colonies. He
[1:15:50] said, "There she is, America."
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; And he said it wasn't a lamb. It was a
[1:15:54] symbol. And when John looked at it, it
[1:15:56] looked like a lamb, but he said, and had
[1:15:59] two horns,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; civil and ecclesiastical powers.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; And he says it wasn't a lamb. It was
[1:16:06] woolly like a lamb, but it was the
[1:16:08] American buffalo.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Wow. When you begin to catch this stuff,
[1:16:13] and I remember reading this in the seven
[1:16:15] church ages and hearing this on the
[1:16:17] tapes, I'm going, "Oh, wow. I was never
[1:16:20] aware of this before."
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; I I I I thought, well, it really doesn't
[1:16:25] matter if we're Baptist or Pentecostal.
[1:16:28] It really doesn't matter because we're
[1:16:31] all going to the same place. We all
[1:16:33] believe the same thing.
[1:16:35] But when the eyes of my understanding
[1:16:39] become opened,
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; I realize that the third pole is a
[1:16:43] separator.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; It is the sharp two-edged sword of the
[1:16:48] spirit. It is the unshathing
[1:16:51] of the sword that declares war. I read
[1:16:53] to you that this last Sunday. Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; So understand when the prophet has the
[1:16:59] sword placed in his hand, he's up in
[1:17:02] Sabino Canyon. And and how many of you
[1:17:05] have hiked to Sabino Canyon? Let me see
[1:17:07] your hands.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; You gone up there. I want to see. Wow. I
[1:17:10] want to see where where this happened.
[1:17:11] That That's good. That's exciting
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; to go up and see where it happened. But
[1:17:16] what happened?
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; It was for a purpose.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; A sword is now unchath and placed into
[1:17:24] his hand. And he thought it was the end.
[1:17:26] Listen to me. He thought, "I'm done with
[1:17:30] no one." Because according to the
[1:17:32] vision, there was a blast. No one can
[1:17:35] live through that.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; He says, "I think I my ministry is over.
[1:17:39] I'm done with. I'm probably not even
[1:17:41] going to come home, Billy. Take care of
[1:17:43] the wife and kids."
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; But when he gets up there and the sword
[1:17:47] appears in his hand, it's not this will
[1:17:50] be the third pull. Not giving a future.
[1:17:54] This is
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; the third pull.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; This is the vindication of your
[1:18:00] ministry. Wait a second. You mean all
[1:18:02] the years prior to the sword coming in
[1:18:04] his hand was not a vindication?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; No, it was just an attraction.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; The first pull didn't expose
[1:18:16] the system.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; It's outer court.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; It's body.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; It's a sign in the hand.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; It's the outer cord. It's little birds.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; I'm just giving you symbols.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Showing you the sec second pull did not
[1:18:39] expose the system.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Though it went to the inner court.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Though it was talking about the spirit
[1:18:47] of man. And brother Brennan preaches a
[1:18:49] sermon, the anointed ones of the end
[1:18:51] time,
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And he says they are false anointed
[1:18:55] ones.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; I thought the anointing was false. He
[1:18:58] said no, they are false seed
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; but true anointing.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; So it goes from the outer court to the
[1:19:07] inner court to the spirit of man to the
[1:19:11] discerning of spirit. The second sign,
[1:19:13] second pole.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. And he said went from little birds
[1:19:17] to what? Doves.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Okay. Symbols. He said but the third
[1:19:23] pole now totally exposes
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the system.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Exposes it.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; It goes now to the holy of holies.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Goes beyond the veil of human flesh.
[1:19:44] goes beyond the outer court, inner court
[1:19:47] into the holy of holies and goes down
[1:19:49] into the soul
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; where the word is revealed. It goes from
[1:19:54] little birds to doves to angels.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; All right. So, the third pole was the
[1:20:03] change of his ministry
[1:20:05] that he kept telling us about.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You know, there's coming a change. you
[1:20:11] know now it won't be something sinful
[1:20:14] won't be but watch I I I've got to back
[1:20:16] off I've got to be very sincere
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; okay because what's coming is far
[1:20:22] greater
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; the other he says that was just a a
[1:20:27] minor
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; healing that's fine discernments that's
[1:20:31] fine
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; but he said I want something far greater
[1:20:34] now
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; which is Christ the mystery of God
[1:20:38] revealed in you
[1:20:41] into the soul.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brennan says in the resume
[1:20:47] of ages, please follow along with me as
[1:20:49] I we're going to do a little bit of
[1:20:51] reading here.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; And I know that I am not here to just
[1:20:56] read
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; quotes from the prophet, but to
[1:21:00] substantiate
[1:21:01] what I'm talking about.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; To show you he said it.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. Resume of the ages. Now, and I
[1:21:10] want to say this to our brothers who
[1:21:12] whether it's Stephen McNeely or Brother
[1:21:14] James Loveall or Brother Warren or
[1:21:16] anybody or visiting ministers, don't
[1:21:19] waste time. Page and paragraph and what
[1:21:22] year?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Tell them where he said it. Let the
[1:21:25] quote say it. Bang. Go. It's Well, let
[1:21:28] me see. Um, page 371,
[1:21:32] paragraph two.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Of the resume. A stop.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Give them the quote. Let's read. Let's
[1:21:39] go on. How many say amen to that? Okay.
[1:21:41] All right. And I don't mean to How many
[1:21:43] say amen?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Now, watch the doctrine of Balum most
[1:21:49] carefully.
[1:21:51] Notice above all that it is the
[1:21:53] deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; to bind the people to them. Yeah.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; So there's a union taking place of
[1:22:03] binding of clergy
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; by leading the people deliberately into
[1:22:09] the sin of unbelief.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; The nicotan doctrine was the corruption
[1:22:16] of the clergy as they sought political
[1:22:20] power amongst themselves.
[1:22:23] While balumism is the subjection of the
[1:22:26] people to their systems of creeds and
[1:22:28] worship in order to hold them.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; So they're developing a system to hold
[1:22:34] people.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding the spirit that's
[1:22:38] holding people corrupt clergy?
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Deliberately,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; bringing the people,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; oh, don't listen to everybody else.
[1:22:47] Listen to us. We got it. We're here.
[1:22:48] We're part of the bride. We're all in.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. So it binds the people.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Now watch this carefully.
[1:22:57] What is it that bound the people to the
[1:22:59] nominal church and thereby destroyed
[1:23:01] them?
[1:23:03] It was the creeds and dogmas formed into
[1:23:06] church tenants.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; It was the doctrine of the Roman
[1:23:11] Catholic Church.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; He's showing you the spirit of the
[1:23:20] system. Yes sir.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Where'd it come from?
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Roman Catholicism.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Balamism,
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; nickelotinism.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "In which things I
[1:23:34] hate."
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; They were not given the true food, the
[1:23:40] word. They were given the food that came
[1:23:43] from idol worship. Yeah.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Babylonian
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; paganism wrapped up in Christian
[1:23:50] terminology.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Let me share a little bit of that with
[1:23:55] you for a moment before we continue
[1:23:57] reading.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Easter,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Christmas,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Valentine's Day.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron.
[1:24:09] Come on, man. You're tearing down my
[1:24:12] Christmas tree. Doesn't really matter. I
[1:24:14] put up the lights and we have a a thing
[1:24:17] and we sing away in a manger and all
[1:24:20] that and it's not we don't worship the
[1:24:22] Christmas tree. Brother Brennham said
[1:24:24] Christianity versus
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; idolatry.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Wrapped up in Christian terminology.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Does it matter if you celebrate a pagan
[1:24:35] holiday
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; brother?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Do we bring it right into our church and
[1:24:41] say it really doesn't matter? Come on,
[1:24:43] brother.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take the word of God as my
[1:24:45] absolute
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm I'm showing you these
[1:24:50] things.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; And they were the very same spirit and
[1:24:54] doctrine is right amongst all
[1:24:56] Protestants and it's called
[1:24:58] denomination.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Nicicoatanism
[1:25:03] is organization
[1:25:06] humanizing the leadership of the church
[1:25:07] and thereby deposing the spirit.
[1:25:10] Balumism is the denominationalism
[1:25:14] which takes the church manual instead of
[1:25:16] the Bible.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; And the and right to this hour, many of
[1:25:22] God's people are caught in the snare of
[1:25:26] denominational
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; is God is crying to them. So what is God
[1:25:33] crying to these that are caught up?
[1:25:35] God's people
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; that are caught up in denominationalism
[1:25:41] just like brother Bobby and them over
[1:25:44] there in Shri for
[1:25:47] that pastor their pastor
[1:25:51] refused brother Brennham and no longer
[1:25:54] wanted to be associated with the message
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; what they did is they started listening
[1:26:00] to tapes because they couldn't go where
[1:26:03] the prophet was always that. So they
[1:26:05] started listening to tapes.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Okay. Because there weren't quote a
[1:26:11] whole lot of message churches at that
[1:26:14] time.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; So as they heard the tapes,
[1:26:22] they began to realize there was more to
[1:26:24] his ministry
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; than just let's say how that we dress.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; And how that we go to church. They
[1:26:32] realize, "Oh my, this is a prophet of
[1:26:34] God."
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:26:39] Now, come out of her, but my people. So
[1:26:42] now, those that were caught in that
[1:26:44] denomin.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Lest you be partakers of her sins,
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; and that you receive not her plagues.
[1:26:58] You see, they are ignorant.
[1:27:02] But if the rapture should take place at
[1:27:04] this moment, ignorance would be no court
[1:27:07] of appeal from the judgment of God for
[1:27:10] being in the wrong ranks.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Does it
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; matter?
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; The revealing of the son of man in this
[1:27:21] hour is the sharp dissection of the
[1:27:25] two-edged sword.
[1:27:27] We know that the sword is a symbol.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; For the word of God goes forth as a
[1:27:32] sharp two-edged sword, even dividing a
[1:27:35] sunder, not between body and spirit,
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; but now between the spirit and the soul.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; And tells you, well, you can have the
[1:27:44] Holy Ghost 24 hours a day and your soul
[1:27:47] still black as night and on its way to
[1:27:49] hell.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Never before did we ever hear something
[1:27:54] like that.
[1:27:58] Do you understand? So now the sword's
[1:28:00] placed in that prophet's hand. And he's
[1:28:03] now dividing between your spirit and
[1:28:05] your soul.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; You may look like a Christian, act like
[1:28:09] a Christian, you may have dance in the
[1:28:12] spirit. You may have the gifts of the
[1:28:14] spirit. You may prophesy. You may do all
[1:28:16] of this stuff. And he says, "And you
[1:28:18] know what? Your soul is not got Christ
[1:28:21] sitting on the control tower." Because
[1:28:23] when the word of God comes forth, you
[1:28:26] don't follow it.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; So, the total exposure of this mystery
[1:28:38] Babylon,
[1:28:39] the mother the mother of harlots,
[1:28:45] it's a system.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; What part of that system
[1:28:50] do we want? What part of it is okay?
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; What part of it do you embrace and say
[1:28:55] it really doesn't matter.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to show you some things
[1:28:59] here. And remember now, Sabino Canyon,
[1:29:04] the sword was placed in the prophet's
[1:29:06] hand.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; This is the third pole. This is the
[1:29:09] vindication of his ministry. So, all of
[1:29:12] that prior was just an attraction. Now
[1:29:15] is a vindication.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:29:18] And with the opening of the seals, it
[1:29:20] declares war.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Never before until now with the opening
[1:29:26] of the seals is it the exposure of the
[1:29:30] system or the spirit in denomination.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Now, Revelation 17 verses 1-6.
[1:29:41] This is your Bible. There came one of
[1:29:44] the seven angels which had the seven
[1:29:46] vials and talked with me, saying unto
[1:29:48] me, come hither.
[1:29:50] I will show unto thee the judgment of
[1:29:52] the great that siteth upon many
[1:29:54] waters. These are symbols,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; many waters as people.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; So it's a system sitting upon many
[1:30:04] people having an influence upon them.
[1:30:07] And how does his influence come? With
[1:30:10] whom the kings of the earth have
[1:30:12] committed fornication?
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; The kings of the earth have committed. I
[1:30:17] want to ask you, how do you commit
[1:30:18] fornication against God? Direct quote.
[1:30:22] When you knowing better by the
[1:30:24] intercourse of the mind, which is the
[1:30:26] wound to your spirit,
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; you add to take away from the word of
[1:30:31] God or say it really doesn't matter. You
[1:30:33] have absolutely committed spiritual
[1:30:36] adultery on Christ the word.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; You want to know we're unclean,
[1:30:40] seducing, lascivious?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; You want to know why
[1:30:47] the young people within this message are
[1:30:50] having such a problem with fornication?
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Right here.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; What is fornication? Unclean living.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:03] What's the difference between
[1:31:04] fornication and adultery? One's the act
[1:31:08] before marriage. The other is the act
[1:31:10] after marriage. Is that right?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; It's all unclean. Religion
[1:31:16] is a sexual spirit.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; It's Jezebel.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Now watch how she watch how she causes
[1:31:28] the people to come under her influence.
[1:31:31] This is the scripture. In whom the kings
[1:31:34] of the earth have committed fornication,
[1:31:37] and the inhabitants of the earth
[1:31:40] have been made drunk
[1:31:43] with the wine of her fornication.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; So whatever stimulation she has in her
[1:31:51] cup,
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; said, "Oh, if I had a cup here and I
[1:31:56] said,"Hey, drink, drink.
[1:31:59] go ahead and drink. And denominations
[1:32:03] are giving you
[1:32:05] the wine of a stimulation. Well,
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; we're all going.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. It doesn't matter how we live. It's
[1:32:13] Yeah.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; And they're stimulated by it.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Right. There they are.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; And they still live in a fornicating,
[1:32:22] adulterous life contrary to the word of
[1:32:25] God. And yet they're drunk.
[1:32:28] Come on. Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; And drunk people are happy.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Drunk people.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; See, so now what she's doing.
[1:32:40] This system giving a cup. What is it?
[1:32:44] Fornication.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; It's unclean living. Doesn't matter the
[1:32:47] way you live. Listen, God loves us all.
[1:32:50] When we all get to heaven. What a day.
[1:32:54] What a lie.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz not everyone's going.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Many are called, but few are chosen.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election.
[1:33:04] Sure.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; For broad is the way.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And many will go in at that gate.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Think of the Broadway.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Bright lights and Broadway.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Hollywood. Hollywood evangelism.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; All of this kind of stuff.
[1:33:25] giving to the church
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; a cup of fornication and they drink it
[1:33:30] and they become stimulated and they
[1:33:33] become deceived.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; So he carried me away in the spirit in
[1:33:40] the wilderness and I saw a woman sit
[1:33:42] upon a scarlet colored beast. It's a
[1:33:46] system. It's a power
[1:33:49] full of names of blasphemy,
[1:33:54] having seven heads and 10 horns. Again,
[1:33:56] these are symbols.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; And the woman was arrayed in purple and
[1:34:01] scarlet color and decked with gold and
[1:34:04] precious stones and pearls, having a
[1:34:07] golden cup in her hand, full of
[1:34:10] abominations and filthiness
[1:34:14] of her fornications.
[1:34:18] It's okay for a woman to cut her hair.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; It's a fornicating spirit.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; It's okay for her to dress any way she
[1:34:27] wants to.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; If she wears clothes that pertains to a
[1:34:32] man, it's an abom it's an abomination.
[1:34:35] But do they believe that?
[1:34:38] Why? They're stimulated. Doesn't matter
[1:34:40] the way we dress.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if I cut my hair or trim
[1:34:43] my hair. Doesn't matter if I shave it
[1:34:45] off.
[1:34:47] Do you see? Because the woman, why the
[1:34:48] woman? Because a woman is a type of the
[1:34:51] church.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I show you a greater mystery
[1:34:54] besides the husband and wife."
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; I show you Christ and his church.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Are we Are we together now?
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; He's saying she's got in her hand a cup
[1:35:05] full
[1:35:08] of abominations
[1:35:10] and filthiness of her fornication. And
[1:35:13] upon her forehead was a name written,
[1:35:16] mystery Babylon.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; The great, the mother of harlots, and
[1:35:20] the abominations of the earth.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Wow. This is this pretty serious, isn't
[1:35:26] it?
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Now, those words are highlighted in your
[1:35:30] Bible. I didn't highlight those.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Those are capitalized.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And I saw the woman drunken with the
[1:35:39] blood
[1:35:41] of all unbelievers. and
[1:35:44] and pagans and sinners and idoltors and
[1:35:48] all.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; What is she drunk with?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; The blood.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; You think it's a system that is not
[1:35:57] going to turn and kill you?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Look at this.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going slow because I want this to
[1:36:10] sink in. Amen.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And I saw her drunken with the blood of
[1:36:16] the saints.
[1:36:18] Look in the dark ages. 68 million.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Marty by who? Catholic church. What was
[1:36:25] it? Spirit.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Have you seen what's happening around
[1:36:30] the world? Recently happened in the DRC.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Democratic Republic of Congo. Yeah,
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; the believers just not I don't know they
[1:36:41] but they were Christians in a church.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; And ISIS went in there and killed over
[1:36:47] 40 of them as they were there in a
[1:36:49] prayer.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; It's coming.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Sure did.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; The spirits that were on Hitler, Moose,
[1:36:59] uh Mussolini and Ikeman are
[1:37:01] pre-tribulation
[1:37:03] spirits,
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; right? What is holding back these people
[1:37:07] that are losing their minds?
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; A mother and father take their two
[1:37:11] daughters on a hike in a place called a
[1:37:14] devil's den.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; They're just hiking out in the and the
[1:37:22] next thing you know, I don't know what
[1:37:24] happened, but the guy kills the father
[1:37:26] first. The mother runs with her two
[1:37:28] daughters to take him to a place of
[1:37:30] safety. And she goes back to try to save
[1:37:32] her husband. And that man killed him.
[1:37:35] Killed her, too.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Why are these people coming with guns?
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; And knives.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; And innocent people just whether they're
[1:37:45] going to church or walking down the
[1:37:47] street.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Think about it.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; This world is going insane.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Do you see spirits influencing people?
[1:38:00] Why are people got road rage and got all
[1:38:03] this kind of stuff? It used to be, you
[1:38:05] know, if you got upset with somebody,
[1:38:06] you get out of the car and you whipped
[1:38:08] him and the fight was over and that's
[1:38:11] it. Not no more, man. You you you get
[1:38:15] upset with somebody. Hey buddy, pull
[1:38:16] over. Okay.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Make my day, buddy.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Huh? Yeah. They'll blow you away.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; You don't even look at people anymore.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Leave them alone. Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Hey man, don't you realize I'm packing?
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I'm packing too. It's just
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; 238s.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Acts
[1:38:41] 238
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; and a sword.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? We fight not against
[1:38:47] flesh and blood, but against
[1:38:48] principalities, powers
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; of the darkness.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:38:55] If you think
[1:39:00] that denominational Christianity is
[1:39:03] harmless.
[1:39:05] You're already deceived.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; You've been drinking of the wrong
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; cup.
[1:39:11] The wrong wine. That's right.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; If you think it really doesn't matter
[1:39:16] how you're baptized,
[1:39:18] Brother Brennham said the devil travels
[1:39:20] in the name of Father, Son, and Holy
[1:39:23] Ghost.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Trinitarian. Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; If you think it really doesn't matter
[1:39:31] whether a woman can cut her hair and
[1:39:33] wear pants,
[1:39:36] you're already drinking to the wrong
[1:39:38] cup. It really doesn't matter, Brother
[1:39:40] Ron. Come on.
[1:39:43] Well, you don't realize
[1:39:46] that you've been influenced
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; and somebody told you it really doesn't
[1:39:50] matter.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Well, this prophet told us it does
[1:39:53] matter. Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Okay, we're together now.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. Brother Brandham in
[1:40:01] 1962 preaches a historical
[1:40:06] um they're all historical, but he begins
[1:40:09] to declare why I am against organized
[1:40:13] religion.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Because everybody wants to know, hey,
[1:40:17] wait a second. You've been going to all
[1:40:19] these organizations.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; You've been going to the Baptists.
[1:40:22] You've been going to Pentecostals.
[1:40:24] You've been going Lutheran. And
[1:40:26] everywhere you were invited, you went,
[1:40:27] you did the sign. You had prayer lines.
[1:40:30] You had people come to Christ. Raise
[1:40:32] your hand. Okay.
[1:40:35] And so now he's declaring because he
[1:40:39] he's there's changing in his ministry.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; So why am I against organized religion?
[1:40:51] He's gone to all of them.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; They've opened the door, but now they're
[1:40:56] closing doors. Watch this. Look
[1:40:58] immediately after her mystery was made
[1:41:00] known, who she was, and what she was,
[1:41:05] who her daughters was, the mystery has
[1:41:09] been made known.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Then God sent an angel, a messenger to
[1:41:13] what?
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Call out,
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; come out.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; The message is not just on how to
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; dress.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Come out.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Come out from the influence of a system
[1:41:31] that is causing you to drink of the cup
[1:41:34] of the wine of her abominations and
[1:41:37] fornications.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; That's why denomination will never
[1:41:42] preach against those things.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] Come out of her, my people, that you be
[1:41:54] not partakers of her plagues. He's going
[1:41:57] to curse her. Watch. Come out of her.
[1:42:00] God sent a mighty angel or a messenger.
[1:42:03] And his light wasn't in a corner. It
[1:42:05] scattered over the earth. Come out of
[1:42:07] her. What? Her and her sisters too to
[1:42:12] lighten the earth and call his people
[1:42:13] out of her. Now you know that's the
[1:42:17] truth. A messenger was sent from heaven
[1:42:20] to go call God's people out of Babylon.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; And his light lighten the earth.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; It shall be light about the evening
[1:42:32] time.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; The path to glory you shall surely find.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; You understand what is this light?
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; And I will send a light unto the
[1:42:41] Gentiles and thy light has come upon
[1:42:45] you. Oh my good. How many of you say,
[1:42:48] "I've seen the light."
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a message.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; We'll walk in the light.
[1:42:58] That beautiful light.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Walk where the dew drops of mercy are
[1:43:06] bright. Shine all around us by day and
[1:43:12] by night.
[1:43:14] Jesus,
[1:43:16] the light of the bride.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; That That was my little adding there in
[1:43:22] the last little bit.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Right before the opening of the seals,
[1:43:27] he is now setting forth a precedent.
[1:43:29] Here's why I'm against organized
[1:43:31] religion. So now he preaches
[1:43:36] two weeks later 62.
[1:43:39] Is this the sign of the end, sir? What
[1:43:41] is the sign? What do you mean the end?
[1:43:44] Is this a sign that this is the end?
[1:43:46] What is it? What scripture does he take
[1:43:48] as his text? Revelations 10 1-7
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; serves.
[1:43:56] Is this the sign? What is all these
[1:43:59] angels and visions and dreams
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; and prophecies going forth? What is it?
[1:44:05] Is this the sign that the end has the
[1:44:08] countdown started?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who do you say this is?
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Watch this, sir. Is this the sign of the
[1:44:16] end?
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Now, when sounding forth, now that's
[1:44:22] thus sayaith the Lord. We have that
[1:44:25] clear. When he sounds forth his message,
[1:44:28] declares war.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Like Paul did on the Orthodox like the
[1:44:35] rest of them did Luther Wesley against
[1:44:38] organization.
[1:44:40] All of them came out against organized
[1:44:44] religion.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; And when he declares war and tells them
[1:44:50] they are lying
[1:44:52] and it's not the truth and they're
[1:44:54] deceiving men,
[1:44:57] when it sounds forth that, you can't
[1:45:00] fail. It won't fail because he'll be
[1:45:03] vindicated by the word of God. You know
[1:45:05] exactly what it is. And when he does, he
[1:45:08] sounds for to call from Babylon.
[1:45:11] Come out of her, my people, that you be
[1:45:13] not partakers of her sins. God send him.
[1:45:17] Don't miss it.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; In the first seal 63.
[1:45:26] I'll just read the highlighted part.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; That organizational system is of the
[1:45:32] devil. Amen.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; And that's no punches pulled out pulled
[1:45:38] on it either. It's exactly
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; it's the root of the devil.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; And now not many people not people in
[1:45:51] there them are God's people many of
[1:45:52] them.
[1:45:54] And when that last angel file flies at
[1:45:58] the same time that message drops here
[1:46:00] for the last trumpet, that angel
[1:46:02] message, the last seal opens, all
[1:46:06] happens at the same time. Yes, sir. All
[1:46:08] seals up and goes over into eternity.
[1:46:12] Brother Brennham said that seventh seal,
[1:46:14] it's a final seal. It's the end of all
[1:46:16] things
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; and the coming of the Lord. The seventh
[1:46:19] seal is the coming of the Lord.
[1:46:21] Revelations 10 1-7 is the coming of the
[1:46:23] Lord. But I want to ask you when do you
[1:46:27] say that he came?
[1:46:30] When the coming of the Lord in his first
[1:46:34] coming when Isaiah prophesied hundreds
[1:46:37] of years before it happened, behold a
[1:46:39] virgin shall conceive and bring forth a
[1:46:42] son.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that was a part of his
[1:46:46] coming? Yet it was hundreds of years
[1:46:48] later that it manifested.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Mary conceived, was that
[1:46:56] his coming?
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Or was it when she gave birth
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; and the shepherds adored him
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; and there was announcements
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; and he was a Christ child.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Was that his coming?
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; These are events
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; that all have to do with his coming.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; It's a process.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; So is this message. It's a process.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; The rapture is a process.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; He said the rapture is a revelation.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; It's a process. It's not just the
[1:47:33] catching away of the bride.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; That's the final event.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Behold, we which are alive and remain
[1:47:39] shall not hinder them which sleep.
[1:47:41] Right?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; That's that's the final catching away.
[1:47:44] But I'll tell you, he's already sent an
[1:47:47] Elijah ministry. Behold, I'll send to
[1:47:49] you Elijah before.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody say before.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Before.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Before the great and terrible day of the
[1:47:55] Lord.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; He's going to turn to hearts.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Do we when we begin to understand what
[1:48:02] was this message all about?
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:48:07] The seriousness of this.
[1:48:10] That's why I want all of you to
[1:48:12] understand that mystery Babylon the
[1:48:15] great
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; is there to try to deceive all those
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; who it possibly can by a system
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; and saying it's okay here it doesn't
[1:48:27] really matter
[1:48:30] and so they drink of that
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; and they're drunk
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; with an inspiration that's incorrect
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; false wine
[1:48:40] will make you as drunk as good wine.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; for sure.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; False stimulation can get you as it
[1:48:47] stimulated as true revelation.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; I've told you the story before. I was
[1:48:52] out hunting. We were hunting elk. We got
[1:48:56] out there and I'd heard the elk bugle.
[1:48:58] They Oh, they sound so close.
[1:49:02] Oh, man. He's close. He's close.
[1:49:06] Lock my gun in. Ready? Oh, I see the
[1:49:10] horns. There he I got you, buddy. I got
[1:49:14] you. I'm getting so hyperventilated and
[1:49:17] it's winter time and everything. And my
[1:49:20] glasses are steaming up. My scope is
[1:49:23] steaming up and Okay, come on, buddy. I
[1:49:27] got you. Yeah. Just Just one more step.
[1:49:36] It's a branch.
[1:49:39] There's a branch moving in the wind.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And yet for 5 10 minutes I was so
[1:49:46] anointed.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; I was so inspired.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; I thought it was a branch.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Yet for a a little bit I was there. I
[1:49:56] was ready, man. That 7 millimeter. I was
[1:49:58] ready to squeeze that trigger.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:50:08] Now I want you to understand please the
[1:50:11] Bible says be not deceived. God is not
[1:50:14] mocked.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; For whatsoever you yield your spirit to
[1:50:19] you become the servant thereof.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Is it Huh? Either to righteousness
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; or to unrighteousness. Because whatever
[1:50:27] you yield, you say it doesn't matter. I
[1:50:30] I'll yield. I'll give right of way. I
[1:50:32] I'll say it really doesn't matter.
[1:50:34] whatsoever you yield. If you yield
[1:50:36] yourself to Jezebel religion,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; come on
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; and say doesn't really matter.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; What you've done
[1:50:48] is you're deceiving yourself because God
[1:50:51] is not mine.
[1:50:54] That's why when you preach the
[1:50:55] revelation of this message in its
[1:50:58] fullness, it causes some people to get
[1:51:01] upset because you're you're making
[1:51:03] people in denomination as though they're
[1:51:06] nonseed. Brother Bram said, "No, if
[1:51:08] they're true seed, they'll hear the word
[1:51:10] for this hour and come up and
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; and come out."
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Now, some are going to stay in there and
[1:51:17] they're foolish virgin. That's right.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; They just fail to hear what the spirit
[1:51:22] is saying to the church.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Just before the Israelites crossed over
[1:51:32] Jordan to possess the land, Joshua, a
[1:51:34] type of the Holy Spirit leadership, told
[1:51:38] the people of Israel to sanctify
[1:51:40] themselves and their homes before you
[1:51:43] cross over.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Three days. Don't even go in under your
[1:51:46] wives.
[1:51:49] It's your Bible.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; This means they said, "Sanctify
[1:51:55] yourselves. Clean yourselves up.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Look at your home."
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; They're getting ready to cross over. And
[1:52:04] I'm saying we're getting ready to cross
[1:52:06] over right now.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Sanctify yourself.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; How is your home doing?
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Have you sanctified it? Have you applied
[1:52:15] the token? What does it mean to apply
[1:52:17] the token? Well, I say I apply the token
[1:52:20] and then you live with the things that's
[1:52:22] contrary to the word of God in your home
[1:52:24] and say you've applied the token.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Be not deceived.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; God is not mocked.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; God is purging the church right now like
[1:52:38] he did Israel.
[1:52:40] Two million, brother Ram said, was a
[1:52:43] mixed multitude.
[1:52:46] Okay. Every trial cause the group to be
[1:52:49] thinned down.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; This is not the time to profess the
[1:52:54] token. It's the time to possess the
[1:52:56] token.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Let the token be applied to our lives
[1:52:59] and to our homes.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let there be a holy fire of God
[1:53:04] that comes down and consumes each one of
[1:53:07] us and bringing the conviction of sin
[1:53:10] and cleansing us from the top to the
[1:53:13] bottom, from the pulpit to the pew.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to apply the token? Oh
[1:53:22] my
[1:53:27] 63 he preaches the token. He says,
[1:53:30] "Apply the token to your house."
[1:53:34] That then what do you do when you apply
[1:53:38] it to your house?
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Move all the trash out.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Get all the short skirts.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Get all the short skirts
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; and the shorts
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; and the cards.
[1:53:59] and the cigarettes
[1:54:02] and the vapes.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach it.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Well, he never said nothing about a
[1:54:09] vaping.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Cigarettes
[1:54:15] and televisions
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; and whatever more. Kick them out the
[1:54:20] door and when you go apply the token, it
[1:54:24] won't stand still for it. Take it all
[1:54:26] out. all the dances, the parties, and
[1:54:29] the rock and roll, old vulgar
[1:54:31] newspapers,
[1:54:33] and stuff like that out of the of the
[1:54:34] world. Kick it out the door. We're
[1:54:36] cleaning out this place around here.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; I remember when I would go to other
[1:54:42] countries, pastors would take my
[1:54:46] children off to themselves and ask them,
[1:54:48] "What does your daddy believe about
[1:54:50] this?" or "What did the prophet say
[1:54:52] about that?"
[1:54:53] And so I remember they they took Amos
[1:54:55] one time and had him and they said,
[1:54:57] "What did the prophet say about
[1:54:59] television?"
[1:55:01] He says, "Well, brother Brandham said,
[1:55:03] kick that thing outside
[1:55:06] and watch it outside."
[1:55:09] [Laughter]
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; You see, it's not kicking it outside,
[1:55:20] watching it outside,
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:23] I remember we lost Amos one time at the
[1:55:25] Flagstaff Mall when they just had opened
[1:55:28] it up right next to Rosson Pyina there
[1:55:31] and the Flagstaff Mall. Mine was great.
[1:55:33] We walked through Sears, I think it was.
[1:55:35] They had a whole wall of televisions
[1:55:37] like all these things here on the wall
[1:55:39] and and guess what? We was holding all
[1:55:40] our kids and I think I'm holding
[1:55:42] Rebecca's and and Sandy is holding
[1:55:45] Matthews and Amos, he's the oldest, so
[1:55:46] he's kind of wandering by himself. Well,
[1:55:48] all of a sudden we lose him. We get we
[1:55:51] get out of Sears and we get into the
[1:55:53] main mall. Where's Amos? Ah, somebody
[1:55:56] child abduction. Sound the alarm. Where
[1:55:58] is he? Ah, you know that's a horrible
[1:56:01] feeling.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Have a child loss. Oh, man. Where'd he
[1:56:04] Where'd he go? We run back and there he
[1:56:06] is in front of all the the whole wall of
[1:56:09] television.
[1:56:12] Amos. Amos, what are you doing?
[1:56:15] I'm watching the radio.
[1:56:21] cuz we used to listen to the craft
[1:56:23] mystery theater. Do you ever you guys
[1:56:25] remember any of the craft mystery
[1:56:30] craft mystery theater and the the man
[1:56:34] come walking through the house and all
[1:56:37] the sound and my kids would all sit,
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; My kids love me to tell them stories.
[1:56:44] Dad, tell us another bedtime story. Tell
[1:56:47] us, you know. Yeah. So I I Well, okay,
[1:56:49] let me tell you about the three little
[1:56:51] bears. The first little bear, his name
[1:56:54] was Amos, and the next one was Rebecca
[1:56:56] and Matthew. And Matthew's sitting there
[1:56:58] sucking his fingers and he's going
[1:57:01] and I says, "And they went into the
[1:57:03] woods and they went out and they was
[1:57:05] lost and they got to this." And I'm
[1:57:06] making this big old elaborate story and
[1:57:08] they're just sitting there and their
[1:57:09] eyes and I says, "And it started to get
[1:57:11] dark and and they saw a big old cave. So
[1:57:14] they went into this cave and they went
[1:57:15] in there. It was dark and it was spooky
[1:57:17] and and they heard something in the
[1:57:19] background and
[1:57:24] all and then I said and then it went you
[1:57:27] know like this and all three of them
[1:57:31] they love for to be entertained to tell
[1:57:34] them
[1:57:36] tell us another story then well saints
[1:57:39] of God listen I don't want to be a
[1:57:41] teller of stories.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; I want to be a preacher of the gospel.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to entertain you.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; I'm here to preach to you the truth.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; And preach to you
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; that there is an opening of the seals.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; And it caused
[1:58:04] the sword of the spirit to come down
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; and divide aunder between the spirit and
[1:58:10] the soul. Yeah.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; And now it cut away everything that was
[1:58:15] not God circumcised this message
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; from the flesh of denominational
[1:58:22] teaching with the opening of the seals.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; And with the first seal, brother Brim
[1:58:27] said, "Well, you all know I preached the
[1:58:28] seals before. It took me about 20
[1:58:30] minutes." And he says, "And I listened
[1:58:32] to Clarence Larkin, Hisop's two
[1:58:35] Babylons,
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; pre- Nioan fathers. He read all of this
[1:58:39] stuff and he said, "Yeah, and a white
[1:58:41] horse writer." Why? That's Christ riding
[1:58:44] down through the ages.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; That was knowledge.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; But he said that morning, he said, "That
[1:58:51] first angel came to me.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Walked into the room.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; I come to hear to give to you the
[1:58:57] opening of the first seat."
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Wow. That white horse rider. It's not
[1:59:02] Christ. It's the Antichrist. Oh my. I
[1:59:06] was 100 miles from the truth. Yes.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Do you see he now cut away
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; that flesh of man's understanding?
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Of denominational teaching of men that
[1:59:18] probed at it. He says what the others
[1:59:20] have probed at down through the ages. He
[1:59:24] said now God is giving his prophet thus
[1:59:27] sayeth the Lord.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; So when you apply the token,
[1:59:35] there must be a response on behalf of
[1:59:37] the believer.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Don't just say, "Yes, I believe it.
[1:59:41] That's nothing but the truth." And then
[1:59:42] don't do nothing about it.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; It's not acknowledging that it's truth.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; It's not just agreeing with it.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; It's not just pressing play.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; But you have to obey.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; You have to apply it.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; That's how it is to apply the token to
[2:00:05] your home. You've got to obey it. It
[2:00:08] must cause you to get into action. It
[2:00:10] caused Noah
[2:00:12] to build an ark. Got him into action.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; It caused Abraham to seek a city whose
[2:00:18] builder and maker is God.
[2:00:21] It caused Moses to apply the blood on
[2:00:23] the doorpost of the home.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Are you you understand? They got into
[2:00:27] action. Amen.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Revelation of this message is to put you
[2:00:32] in action. If there is no action,
[2:00:34] there's no manifestation. If there's no
[2:00:36] manifestation, it's just knowledge.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yep.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; And knowing what's right to do does not
[2:00:43] give you the power to do it.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I know. I know. I I know. I
[2:00:52] know.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But why not do it? Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Let's apply the token.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Let's apply the word of God in our lives
[2:01:02] and let her see a manifestation.
[2:01:04] And we have to tell that to our
[2:01:06] children. And our children come under
[2:01:08] the leadership of the revelation of the
[2:01:11] head of the house because he basically
[2:01:14] is the absolute to that family.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:01:19] Fathers, I want you to understand, no
[2:01:21] matter what we preach here at home, it's
[2:01:23] what you apply at your house.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Of whether or not your kids are going to
[2:01:28] follow.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Because you can say you believe it and
[2:01:31] they see you live a life that is
[2:01:33] contrary to it.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; What's this message behind that?
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; I need to do what I want. Soon as I get
[2:01:40] out of the house and have my own thing,
[2:01:42] have my own apartment. I can do what I
[2:01:44] want. Nobody gonna force me to do I
[2:01:47] could. If I want to wear pants, I'll
[2:01:49] wear pants.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. So,
[2:01:55] parents understand, do not preach
[2:01:57] legalism to your children.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; That's not it. They don't understand
[2:02:03] about those kind of things.
[2:02:07] I remember how it was so nice that
[2:02:11] Sandy,
[2:02:13] we went over to my sister's house over
[2:02:15] in California, Huntington Beach. She
[2:02:18] married a multi-millionaire.
[2:02:20] Her kids were spoiled little girls, my
[2:02:24] nieces, they were given anything. They
[2:02:26] went out to dinner and when they ordered
[2:02:28] from the meal, they didn't order from
[2:02:29] the kids menu. They order, well, I'll
[2:02:33] take a T-bone steak, medium well, and
[2:02:36] baked potato and everything like that.
[2:02:38] And then they cut and eat a little piece
[2:02:39] of it and waste it.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; And our kids, no, you ain't getting
[2:02:43] that. You're going to get over here
[2:02:44] child's menu. You get the macaroni and
[2:02:47] cheese or you get the hamburger or
[2:02:49] whatever. You know,
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; why don't we Well, you can spoil your
[2:02:55] kids. So, my sister, she didn't hold
[2:02:58] nothing back for her girls. the latest
[2:03:00] fashion, all the bell bottoms, the the
[2:03:03] jeans, the the the clothing, and all the
[2:03:06] kinds of stuff that you would get in
[2:03:08] modern day fashion. And when
[2:03:13] my family would go to visit my sister,
[2:03:18] my sister would say, "Hey, my girls have
[2:03:22] outgrown all of their their clothing.
[2:03:24] Rebecca, come on in here. We want" And
[2:03:26] so they and oh, look at this. They start
[2:03:29] giving her all kinds of stuff. Well,
[2:03:30] man, she gets all her eyes get real big.
[2:03:33] She tries on some pants. Wow. Looks in
[2:03:36] the mirror.
[2:03:39] Okay. Well, anyway, this is just
[2:03:42] personal testimony.
[2:03:44] So, then you have to say and you you
[2:03:47] want to you don't want to tell your
[2:03:49] sister that's an abomination in the eyes
[2:03:51] of God.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; You know, and they don't understand
[2:03:55] that. The Bible says carnally-minded
[2:03:56] people are enmity with God. Neither can
[2:03:58] they understand the things of God.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; So, we graciously accepted it and we
[2:04:03] thought, "Well, we'll throw out the
[2:04:04] stuff that we can't use when we get
[2:04:06] home."
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; But anyway, my wife took little Rebecca
[2:04:10] and sat her down, said, "Sweetheart,
[2:04:12] those things are not what little girls
[2:04:15] should be wearing in this day. You
[2:04:16] should you look so much nicer in a
[2:04:18] dress."
[2:04:21] and applied that to their heart
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; because they don't understand. If we
[2:04:26] make this message rules and regulations
[2:04:29] are kids,
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; okay, if you tell your kids you cannot
[2:04:33] play sports,
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; no way. You realize that's of the devil.
[2:04:38] You can't even read comic books.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; And on pretty soon, you know, your kids
[2:04:46] are so restricted
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. that they look at this message as
[2:04:50] a bunch of
[2:04:52] regulations.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Well, do you let me just share with you
[2:04:59] in the Bible there's so much more thou
[2:05:01] shalt
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; instead of thou shalt not.
[2:05:06] This message is so vast
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; and the more that I get into it and the
[2:05:12] more that I study it as a minister of
[2:05:14] God,
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; then it makes me aware of a system that
[2:05:19] is out there that is trying to permeate
[2:05:22] itself right into this message
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; starts with fashion,
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; television, movies,
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; internet, cell phone.
[2:05:34] Come on.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; And if it comes into the house, how how
[2:05:37] does it come through? The head of the
[2:05:39] house allows it.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Achan, that's what he did.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Little
[2:05:46] Babylonian garments. It doesn't really
[2:05:48] matter. It's my home.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Won't affect the church.
[2:05:53] Wedges of silver and of gold.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Head of the house will carry the
[2:05:59] responsibility.
[2:06:01] Brothers, understand you're the head of
[2:06:03] your house.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; If you fail to apply the token,
[2:06:08] then your children will not make it
[2:06:11] because you're not applying the token to
[2:06:13] your family. And if you kids sit there
[2:06:15] and think, well, daddy said the token is
[2:06:17] applied and you don't see any
[2:06:19] manifestation, he's deceiving you.
[2:06:24] Because otherwise it well you know I've
[2:06:26] heard young people say well parents said
[2:06:28] I'm applying the token to you and though
[2:06:31] you're not living the life uh you're
[2:06:34] going to go anyway. That's not true.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; If you're not living the life you're not
[2:06:40] going.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; How dare you
[2:06:46] dilute
[2:06:48] the token of the hour?
[2:06:51] How dare you say it doesn't really
[2:06:54] matter?
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Must I go to heaven
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; on a flowery bed of ease?
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; When others sought to gain the prize,
[2:07:10] they sailed through bloody seas.
[2:07:14] I must fight if I must reign. Increase
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; my courage, Lord.
[2:07:22] I'm putting responsibility back on you
[2:07:24] men.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Don't place it on. If you miss it, it's
[2:07:29] not because we're not trying to preach
[2:07:30] it.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Responsibility is what you do at home.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Where did the children learn to get a an
[2:07:41] attitude against the ministry of Elijah
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; and say, "Oh, bald head. Oh, bald head."
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Huh? Come on.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; He said they were sitting around the
[2:07:50] dinner table and heard mom and dad talk
[2:07:52] against the ministry.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Parents,
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; if you're critical,
[2:08:01] at least don't say it in front of your
[2:08:02] kids.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? When they're
[2:08:05] going to go to church and they hear,
[2:08:07] "Well, you know, I heard daddy say what
[2:08:09] ministry really doesn't matter and on."
[2:08:12] Then they then when the ministry is
[2:08:15] there trying to save them,
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; they say, "I ain't listening to you. I
[2:08:20] heard my daddy say I heard mama say."
[2:08:22] Doesn't really matter. Don't listen to
[2:08:24] him, old baldheaded.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Depends on attitudes.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. It really does.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:08:39] Brother Johnny Green came into my office
[2:08:41] just before service. Brother Ron, I want
[2:08:44] to tell you something.
[2:08:47] He says, "I've been invited by two of my
[2:08:49] sons to come down and
[2:08:52] the doors been opened for me to just
[2:08:54] come down and have fellowship with him."
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; I said, "Brother Johnny,
[2:09:04] what a great opportunity.
[2:09:10] I said, "Use discernment and wisdom."
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; I said, "Love your children. Tell them,
[2:09:16] daddy's always loved you,
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; even if you didn't serve God in the way
[2:09:21] that I see." And I said, "And I pray
[2:09:24] that God will use you
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; to win your own children." What good is
[2:09:28] it? We go out here and we go to all
[2:09:30] these countries and we try to win all
[2:09:31] these converts to Christ and we lose our
[2:09:33] kids. Amen.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; I want to take every one of my kids.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want them to have some kind of
[2:09:43] religion.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be the Amish of the end
[2:09:49] end time that we wear our hats and our
[2:09:51] beards and our our special clothes and
[2:09:54] try to stay away from the world and we
[2:09:57] go back to horse and buggy. Ah,
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; no no no. You miss it.
[2:10:03] Let us bring our children to an into a
[2:10:05] relationship with Jesus Christ.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said the first
[2:10:14] audio visual
[2:10:16] he says that the devil brought into the
[2:10:19] world was he called it a biocope.
[2:10:22] That was a movie house, a bioscope.
[2:10:27] He said, "We used to go down and we take
[2:10:29] a couple cents and go get a bag of
[2:10:31] popcorn and sit there and and
[2:10:33] everything." He was just raised up as a
[2:10:35] normal kid.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Huh? And so he went down to the biocope.
[2:10:40] Now, anything that'll make you
[2:10:41] compromise on the word of God is an
[2:10:44] enticing spirit.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. Anything that'll
[2:10:48] cause you to compromise
[2:10:51] on any portion of the word of God is a
[2:10:53] compromising spirit. A Jezebel spirit,
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; A religious spirit, a seducing spirit.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Anything.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Well, it really doesn't matter. Now,
[2:11:08] watch what Brother Rem said.
[2:11:11] God keeps his word.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Put television out the way it is now and
[2:11:17] uncensored programs of all this
[2:11:19] vulgarity and everything.
[2:11:22] Let a little boy go.
[2:11:25] The gate to the eye is the soul. The eye
[2:11:28] is the gate to the soul rather. Let him
[2:11:31] go and let these little girls go into
[2:11:34] one of these movies or something or
[2:11:37] other and see one of these here women
[2:11:39] out of Hollywood with eight or 10
[2:11:42] husbands making love to some man. That
[2:11:46] little girl will practice the same thing
[2:11:48] the next day.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Does it matter?
[2:11:57] You see, if we let the uncensored and
[2:12:00] next thing you know, pretty soon it used
[2:12:01] to be, you remember the things were
[2:12:03] censored. Well, that blink blank
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; if they blanked every censored word now
[2:12:10] half the dialogue and he went blink over
[2:12:13] there and blink it'd just be blank blank
[2:12:16] blank. Everything be redacted.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:24] If they take away sex and violence from
[2:12:27] every major movie,
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; are you kidding me?
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't get any awards.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the world is feeding upon.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; It's what the first thing that was fed
[2:12:43] upon the children of God in the Garden
[2:12:47] of Eden, sex
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; and violence.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Who am I? My brother's keeper.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me what to do.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; I can bring any sacrifice I want to. Why
[2:13:00] is thy countenance fallen, Cain? Why are
[2:13:03] you upset? Did I not give you a word?
[2:13:06] Didn't I get give you? If you'll give
[2:13:08] the same sacrifice your brother did, but
[2:13:10] he couldn't do it. Why in none seed,
[2:13:12] there's nothing to quicken.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; And he gets upset and wroth with God.
[2:13:20] said, 'Well, I'm going to offer whatever
[2:13:22] I want to.
[2:13:24] He says, 'What you feed on? Let me go in
[2:13:26] your office, sir.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; And tell me you're a Christian. Let me
[2:13:32] hear you. Turn on your radio when I'm
[2:13:34] there. And you're listening to some kind
[2:13:36] of old boogie woogie music. Let me see
[2:13:39] half-dressing uh women pinups on the
[2:13:42] side of your wall. I don't care what you
[2:13:44] say. I know what your spirit's feeding
[2:13:47] on.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; it's a tool in the hand of Satan to
[2:13:52] brainwash the minds of the American
[2:13:53] people. The radio started first.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says, "What was one of the
[2:13:58] first uh wrong type of songs?"
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Roll them, Giries, roll them. Remember I
[2:14:05] I went and found that for you and I
[2:14:06] played the tapes. It's a snappy little
[2:14:08] tune. Roll them giries. Roll them. Show
[2:14:11] them your pretty knees. Haha. And
[2:14:13] grandma and paw.
[2:14:16] And he says, "See, it was already
[2:14:18] affecting the minds of the people. It
[2:14:21] started with a radio and the prophet of
[2:14:23] God saw it in its embionic form.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; What would it think now of the vulgarity
[2:14:30] of the rappers
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; speaking such vulgar things about women?
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me?"
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Then came the television.
[2:14:44] It had an impact
[2:14:46] by the programs that people watched.
[2:14:49] Then come the computer,
[2:14:52] a revised version,
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; a more intellectual version. Then along
[2:14:59] comes the cell phone
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; where all of the above are in one thing.
[2:15:03] Music, movies,
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; right? There
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; parents.
[2:15:11] If Steve Jobs
[2:15:14] And these other guys, I forget the other
[2:15:15] one,
[2:15:17] refuse to let their children until
[2:15:20] they're 18 have a cell phone. What about
[2:15:23] you?
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; They're the inventors.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; I said, "We're not going to let our kids
[2:15:29] have until they're about 18." Because
[2:15:30] you know what? It's a babysitter.
[2:15:33] Musicians, if you come, I listen. I'm
[2:15:35] I'm not going to be able to finish this.
[2:15:37] I thought tonight or today I could
[2:15:39] finish this. I can't
[2:15:41] because I want to go slowly. I want to
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; I want to cover these things.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; One of the worst babysitters that you
[2:15:49] could give your children today is a cell
[2:15:52] phone.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Give me this here. Have the phone. Have
[2:15:58] the phone, man. Okay.
[2:16:02] And they sit there
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; bugeyed.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Huh? Then you have family reunion.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; The kids sit on the couch.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; No talking with grandma and grandpa.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; No interaction.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; If I had a loaded pistol up here,
[2:16:31] I said, "Hey,
[2:16:34] you know what, Justin? Go and bring your
[2:16:37] little girls up here. I got a gun. Let
[2:16:39] them play with it.
[2:16:41] I don't play cowboys and Indians.
[2:16:46] I hope that what you would do is say,
[2:16:48] "Brother Ron, as much as I love you,
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; don't hand my kids a loaded weapon.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; In fact, I don't even want to get close
[2:17:00] to it." Do you see that? Go ahead and
[2:17:02] just play something softly here.
[2:17:07] You hand your children. You may think
[2:17:09] I'm oldfashioned. You may think,
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; saints of God,
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; watch your children.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Watch your children.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Watch over them. You hand them that and
[2:17:23] say, "It's okay." All right. I done
[2:17:26] warned you.
[2:17:31] Because in their room at night by
[2:17:36] themselves
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; with a little haze blue light.
[2:17:42] [Music]
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; And they have access to anything.
[2:17:48] There's no filter.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:52] Without the Holy Spirit in your life,
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; there is nothing to filter out
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; the things of the world.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; There is no filter.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; You think you parents, you can put a
[2:18:07] child filter on their phone or whatever.
[2:18:12] Hey, let me tell you, those kids know
[2:18:13] how to use your phone much smarter than
[2:18:16] you do.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. I I have my phone is
[2:18:21] acting up. It's not working right. I
[2:18:22] hand it to one of my kids. Okay, here
[2:18:25] here grandpa. It's done. How'd you do
[2:18:27] that? It just It's simple to me.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Why are they called smartphones? Because
[2:18:38] they're smarter than you are.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; About the time I buy an iPhone smart 12
[2:18:43] or whatever they call it is and
[2:18:45] everything. Now they come out with 16 or
[2:18:46] 18 and it's got a flamethrower of mega
[2:18:51] power and everything and you can you
[2:18:53] know you want this and get the new one.
[2:19:01] Man, I haven't figured out the one I
[2:19:03] got.
[2:19:07] They get a one that's even that much
[2:19:08] smarter. Yeah.
[2:19:12] The prophet took
[2:19:15] the sword of the spirit, began to
[2:19:17] dissect and discern what's troubling you
[2:19:20] in your spirit realm.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Come closer, sir.
[2:19:25] That won't hurt you.
[2:19:28] That's him.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I see you now. I I see you. There's
[2:19:34] something troubling you.
[2:19:36] It's your wife.
[2:19:39] Oh, yeah. And you you took her and you
[2:19:43] and you know the discernments. Or I saw
[2:19:46] you young girl. You you've got a phobia
[2:19:48] about a certain thing. Oh, you're afraid
[2:19:51] of dogs because when you were a little
[2:19:53] girl, you were chased by a dog and so
[2:19:55] you have this phobia. Are those things
[2:19:57] right? Yes. Yes.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; You see, he was discerning. Now you go
[2:20:02] into the thumb and they wonder why
[2:20:05] that something was bothering them to
[2:20:08] such a degree. It took the Holy Spirit
[2:20:10] to discern are those things true? Yes.
[2:20:14] Yes, that's true. Come here. Let me pray
[2:20:16] for you.
[2:20:21] The reason young people within this
[2:20:23] message,
[2:20:25] I had a brother send me a link
[2:20:28] to a minister who's preaching about
[2:20:31] sexuality.
[2:20:34] It's got over 10,000 hits
[2:20:37] talking about sex within the message.
[2:20:40] And our kids have got to hear about
[2:20:41] this. Well, I agree. We need to tell you
[2:20:44] because you know what? You're going to
[2:20:45] face it.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:47] You're going to face it.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; You want to know why
[2:20:53] young people got problems with seducing
[2:20:55] spirits and fornicating spirits and
[2:20:57] adulterous spirits? Cuz you open the
[2:20:59] doorway.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; You got a stronghold.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; You listen to the wrong kind of music.
[2:21:05] You watch the kind of wrong kind of
[2:21:07] music and oh, oh, I wonder why I can't
[2:21:10] get free of this lust spirit.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz you don't open the door. Now, no
[2:21:15] matter how much you anoint them with oil
[2:21:17] and lay hands on them, that devil has a
[2:21:19] right to stay there. Why? Because they
[2:21:22] open the door. And until they close the
[2:21:25] door and admit and confess
[2:21:30] and become convicted of the life they're
[2:21:32] living,
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; ymen.
[2:21:38] It's not a cure all to have everybody
[2:21:40] come through a prayer line, but get all
[2:21:42] the ministers to lay hands on you and
[2:21:48] [Music]
[2:21:50] and they think that they got free of it
[2:21:52] and they go
[2:21:53] couple weeks and oh yes, yes, you're
[2:21:55] free. Come on, praise the Lord.
[2:21:59] Couple weeks later, the scripture said,
[2:22:01] "And a strong man being cast out of the
[2:22:03] house goeth and find others even worse.
[2:22:07] And the house having not been filled, he
[2:22:10] goes and gets these other spirits and
[2:22:12] come back. And the condition of the
[2:22:14] house is worse.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; That's why these many of the young
[2:22:19] people are really getting to
[2:22:21] disillusioned.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; They've gone from this camp to that camp
[2:22:24] and this t preacher to this preacher and
[2:22:27] some preaches. It's so dynamic and
[2:22:28] they're the their deliverance ministries
[2:22:31] and come up here and and
[2:22:34] we're going to lay hands and that
[2:22:35] devil's going to cast off and all this
[2:22:37] stuff and they've gone to all of these
[2:22:39] meetings and when it's all said and
[2:22:41] done, where do they what kind of life do
[2:22:43] they live?
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; Then they get disillusioned. Well, I
[2:22:47] guess there's nothing to it.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; And somebody talked to me the other day
[2:22:55] about adult
[2:22:57] Uh, video games.
[2:23:00] Adult video games. Now, I guess they're
[2:23:03] video games. I've never I played one
[2:23:06] video game way back. It was Pac-Man.
[2:23:10] It goes and you remember that, huh? gun
[2:23:14] and it goes and swallows up and pretty,
[2:23:16] you know, and it had a music and then
[2:23:19] then the excuse me, I guess I've done
[2:23:20] two ninja
[2:23:25] and all this stuff. The music and every
[2:23:28] level the music gets higher and more
[2:23:30] intense
[2:23:32] like this man going
[2:23:35] that got me. I go back to square one.
[2:23:40] But these video games that adults play,
[2:23:44] you think it's innocent.
[2:23:48] Computer games, stay away from them.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Adults playing it.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; And then you wonder why the kids would
[2:23:56] have a problem with it.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[2:24:00] I'm just trying to tell you truth,
[2:24:02] saints.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[2:24:05] You apply the word as you hear it in
[2:24:09] your life and say, "I'm going to do
[2:24:11] better."
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Wow. I got
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; That's okay. I I I'm done for today. I
[2:24:23] think I've
[2:24:25] made a couple points.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that this
[2:24:31] system
[2:24:32] that is out there
[2:24:35] fashions,
[2:24:37] music,
[2:24:39] television,
[2:24:40] computer,
[2:24:42] movies, let's call it mass media.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Is all out there to try to tell you, "Go
[2:24:51] ahead and drink."
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; It's okay.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; It's all right, man. Come on. It's
[2:24:57] innocent. Just a little sip. And when
[2:24:59] you take a little sip, he just holds the
[2:25:02] bottom of the Come on. A little more.
[2:25:03] Ah, that's Yeah, come on.
[2:25:08] Until you've megga dosed
[2:25:12] [Music]
[2:25:15] and then you wonder,
[2:25:18] how did I get this way?
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; How did I get where?
[2:25:24] How did I become the way I've become?
[2:25:30] [Music]
[2:25:34] remember that
[2:25:36] little girl that was at the altar and
[2:25:38] brother Brennham told him he said sis
[2:25:40] you need to stay here you haven't you
[2:25:42] haven't repented all the way and
[2:25:44] everything anyway she resented brother
[2:25:45] Brennham
[2:25:47] got a little bit upset with him and she
[2:25:49] left
[2:25:51] I think it was just a short while later
[2:25:53] maybe a year or two and he saw her on
[2:25:55] the street
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; drunk
[2:26:01] your clothes half offer.
[2:26:04] Hey preacher, you want a drink?
[2:26:08] Oh,
[2:26:10] [Music]
[2:26:12] he says, "Remember that night that you
[2:26:15] told me?"
[2:26:17] Yeah, I do, sis.
[2:26:21] Well, I didn't listen to you.
[2:26:26] Then I took a spirit and now I can't
[2:26:29] quit.
[2:26:31] [Music]
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; Do you do you all remember I was with
[2:26:35] brother Joseph Brandom. I'm saying this
[2:26:38] in closing.
[2:26:43] Joseph went and bought some flowers. We
[2:26:46] were in his car together. He said,
[2:26:48] "Excuse me, I want to take this by this
[2:26:51] hospice." I think it was it was a place
[2:26:53] for older people.
[2:26:56] He said, "I want to take in." He said,
[2:26:57] "Do you remember daddy talking about his
[2:27:00] first girlfriend that made fun of him
[2:27:02] that he wouldn't smoke a cigarette?"
[2:27:04] [Music]
[2:27:06] Had a neck like a swan. And you know how
[2:27:09] he says, "Oh, my just" And he says, she
[2:27:12] says, "Uh, Bill, you want a you want a
[2:27:15] cigarette?" "No, no, ma'am. No thanks. I
[2:27:18] don't smoke." "You don't smoke? Are you
[2:27:20] big
[2:27:27] I want to be big bad bill. Give me that
[2:27:30] cigarette.
[2:27:33] [Music]
[2:27:35] Goes off crying.
[2:27:38] Joseph said, "Brother Ron, just stay
[2:27:40] right here. I'm going to take these
[2:27:42] flowers to brother Brandham's first
[2:27:44] girlfriend.
[2:27:46] Take him in there." He said,
[2:27:50] goes in there and she says, "Joe,
[2:27:55] ever since I made fun of your daddy that
[2:27:57] he wouldn't smoke a cigarette."
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Said, "Now I became a chain smoker
[2:28:02] and my life fell apart."
[2:28:05] She said, "If I could ever relive a day
[2:28:07] over again, I would have never made fun
[2:28:09] of you."
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; Be careful what you make fun of.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't understand this
[2:28:18] message, don't ever make fun of it.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; You just hold it before God and say,
[2:28:23] "God, in your season, if you want me to
[2:28:26] know, please let me know." Depends on
[2:28:28] your attitude. If you ask,
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; he'll give.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; If you seek, you shall find.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; If you knock,
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; the door shall be open. God bless you.
[2:28:39] We're talking about
[2:28:43] come out of her, my people.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be ye separate,
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; lest you be partakers of her plagues.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. What's the name of this song?

[2:34:38] I appreciate you, brother Bobby.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; You're an elder
[2:34:44] because you've been through things.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; You've stayed true to the word of God.
[2:34:51] When your pastor rejected the word
[2:34:55] and no longer embraced the ministry, it
[2:34:58] caused you to take a step higher.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; And you come out.
[2:35:06] And you've been out all this time. But
[2:35:08] when you came out, you came in.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; What'd you come into? The revealed word.
[2:35:14] You've embraced it all your life,
[2:35:15] brother.
[2:35:18] You've loved it. You've given your life
[2:35:20] for it, have you not?

[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; It's a journey, isn't it?
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; We've made mistakes.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
