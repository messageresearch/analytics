[31:43] of Hannah. She cried all day and night.
[31:48] Oh Lord,
[31:50] do not pass me by.
[31:55] Through her prayers and supplication,
[31:59] our God delivered her. And by faith, she
[32:04] held the evidence in her arms.
[32:08] Oh, we are the evidence of the truth.
[32:13] Yes, the evidence of his word. Don't
[32:17] give up, no give in.

[33:09] ups and downs, the pain, the grief, and
[33:13] now God has been by our side.
[33:20] It's not by chance we've conquered all,
[33:23] but by grace and grace alone, we are the
[33:28] evidence that God is still alive.

[39:15] &gt;&gt; "Amen. God bless you." You can be seated
[39:18] for a moment this morning.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:24] Amen. Amen. Just have a couple things
[39:27] here I'd like to share with you this
[39:30] morning here before we start our
[39:32] service. As you all know, here in
[39:34] America, we had a a tragedy just last
[39:37] week.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; It's upon us.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Darkness is covering the face of the
[39:48] earth.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; In gross darkness, the people.
[39:54] Now, brother Brandham actually believed
[39:57] that he would get shot from the pulpit.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; They're going to share with you a few
[40:04] things. Even as brother Renham in the
[40:06] mid50s
[40:08] while he was overseas, he had brethren
[40:11] and German
[40:13] guards that surrounded him and kept his
[40:17] head down and they ushered him in and
[40:20] out of meetings.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Wow. because of death threats saying
[40:26] &gt;&gt; that they're going to shoot him with a
[40:27] scope at night
[40:29] uh at a long distance or whatever
[40:33] &gt;&gt; and we are in the midst. Brother Bram
[40:36] said, "Now watch." He said, "Don't fear
[40:38] communism."
[40:40] &gt;&gt; You know, people are talking about Putin
[40:42] and and Kim Jong-un and the different
[40:46] powers. He said, "Now watch those isms
[40:49] are going to come together."
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Okay? And he said, "Don't fear." He
[40:54] said, "Communism would actually take
[40:56] over without firing a shot." Said, "How
[40:59] will they do it? They're going to take
[41:01] your young."
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:04] He said what is causing it?
[41:06] &gt;&gt; The colleges
[41:09] &gt;&gt; and the higher educated people.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; You young people that are in anywhere
[41:16] from grade school, high school
[41:18] &gt;&gt; and the university,
[41:21] &gt;&gt; it is from the tree of knowledge.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; And understand that it is a
[41:30] radicalization.
[41:33] that is coming against not only the
[41:36] Jews, anti-semitic,
[41:39] &gt;&gt; but against Christians.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; And we've got to be aware of that.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Uh you heard just last week, I think 89
[41:52] Christian people killed in Mosmb beek
[41:55] &gt;&gt; at a funeral for one of their church
[41:58] members.
[41:59] And they just went there.
[42:01] uh local jihadists went ahead and just
[42:04] massacred all the people.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; And just a few weeks before that in
[42:08] Congo,
[42:11] they had killed about 47 people also
[42:14] that had gone to church and then they
[42:18] burnt the building also.
[42:20] Yeah.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Um,
[42:22] you see here in America the killing of
[42:26] children
[42:27] &gt;&gt; while they're in church
[42:30] &gt;&gt; praying
[42:32] &gt;&gt; and the spirit was we want to kill the
[42:34] young
[42:36] and
[42:38] we we see these things and I don't want
[42:40] to elaborate on that
[42:43] but there was a man by the name of uh
[42:46] Charlie Kirk who was just a voice trying
[42:51] to stand for what is right.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; And biblical principles and he didn't
[42:57] mind having uh a debate or to share his
[43:01] viewpoint and you know uh the people
[43:05] would get quite adamant and against him
[43:08] and they said he was divisive. No, he
[43:10] wasn't.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; He let them people talk.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; He he his thing was prove me wrong. He
[43:16] had the right attitude. All, you know,
[43:20] uh, some of them would just get so
[43:22] blatantly angry and everything and
[43:24] you're judging. No, I'm not judging you.
[43:26] Here's what the word says.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you that Satan does not
[43:32] care.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Uh, when you use the word, he gets
[43:36] upset.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; That's why when God sends a prophet
[43:42] &gt;&gt; in this hour, he returns you back to the
[43:44] word. Amen.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Back to uh what God has spoken. Now, I
[43:52] wanted to show you just a couple quotes.
[43:54] And if the brethren are ready, I've got
[43:57] the thumbs up. We're going to Can we
[43:59] show it on the overhead and hear the
[44:01] quote also? Okay. So, I want you to see
[44:04] 1956
[44:06] and listen to what brother Brennham says
[44:08] here. watching it through the different
[44:11] nations throughout the world. I've come
[44:13] this issue get into a communistic
[44:15] country where I've had to be I've had to
[44:18] have people with rifles to keep the
[44:20] crowds back and I've had to have people
[44:23] that were soldiers that have had to duck
[44:24] my head down and mill around me to keep
[44:26] getting shot so they get me out into
[44:29] somewhere into the darkness where they
[44:30] couldn't see to shoot me at and things
[44:33] like that. Preaching the gospel,
[44:35] bringing good tidings of great joy of
[44:38] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; And then it's it's marvelous to know
[44:42] that Jesus in the midst of all of that
[44:44] just sweet
[44:47] &gt;&gt; and just nothing alarming about it. Just
[44:49] taking a message.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just taking a message.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; We're packing that same message.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; It's not going to make you popular.
[45:03] Some will hate you. Jesus said,
[45:06] &gt;&gt; "You'll be hated without a cause. If
[45:08] they hated me,
[45:10] &gt;&gt; remember it was the religious,
[45:13] &gt;&gt; religion's a covering,
[45:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Not just a church. It's a covering. It
[45:18] can be far left, far right, it doesn't
[45:21] matter. It's
[45:23] &gt;&gt; a religion. And when you disagree with
[45:25] somebody, now the prophet said, "We can
[45:27] disagree. Disagree vehemently."
[45:30] &gt;&gt; But in the backyard, we can fight, but
[45:33] in the front yard, we're brethren.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; We don't have a right to sit there. It
[45:37] was Cain
[45:39] &gt;&gt; that killed Abel.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Because of a righteous revelation.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; And so, we can see that these things are
[45:49] happening around us. We're in the midst
[45:50] of it. Do we have the next quote here?
[45:55] Would you be willing to be a martyr for
[45:57] him? Aaron,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; if it come to the spot that you had to
[46:02] face death or take it back, would you
[46:04] face it?
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. It would be a pleasure.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; That's where I want to go. Right in the
[46:11] pulpit. That's right.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; I thought I got it and he was going to
[46:14] get it in Germany here not long ago. Oh,
[46:17] they was going to shoot me through a
[46:18] night scope and German soldiers run all
[46:19] around and help back like that. I
[46:21] thought what a wonderful thing it would
[46:23] be to die for my Lord right here on the
[46:25] field. Oh,
[46:27] what a what a wonderful thing.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Now straight to the heart.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; All right, we'll go.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Hard to make. Some of these days they'll
[46:36] be shot for it. But remember this that
[46:39] the churches are being bewitched for
[46:41] this ecumenical council. He's taking it
[46:43] right into it to say you're the same
[46:45] group. You're not the same group.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Come out from among that stuff and be
[46:49] separated. It certainly is.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; It's true. We keep away from that stuff
[46:55] as far as you can from it.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Watching it.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; So you can see brother Brenamman is
[47:02] pointing to a spirit,
[47:04] &gt;&gt; not people.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit behind them
[47:09] &gt;&gt; pushing them,
[47:12] &gt;&gt; causing them to get so angry.
[47:15] What would cause
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Cain to get so upset with his brother
[47:22] &gt;&gt; that he desired to kill him?
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Now we're seeing this. It's happening
[47:28] today. The flashing red lights are here.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; It's there.
[47:34] And you know, so uh if in the mid50s,
[47:40] &gt;&gt; brother Brennham is having death threats
[47:43] because of the gospel he preached.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Because he's just bringing us back to
[47:50] the word. He's saying now these other
[47:52] religions, I'm not here against the
[47:54] people. It's a system.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit that's pushing them.
[47:59] Because a religious system is what
[48:02] killed 68 million martyrs
[48:05] &gt;&gt; during the dark ages.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And he said, "There'll come a time where
[48:09] they'll kill you in the name of the
[48:10] Lord, thinking they're doing God a
[48:12] service."
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:15] So they silenced his voice,
[48:20] but they can't silence what he was
[48:23] standing for
[48:24] &gt;&gt; because it was true.
[48:27] And brother Brennham said, "You can
[48:28] silence my voice." But he said, "That
[48:30] message will never be stopped." He said,
[48:32] "It will continue on."
[48:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "The voice will continue." Why?
[48:36] Because the same voice
[48:38] &gt;&gt; that's been down through the ages
[48:41] &gt;&gt; as it was in the days of the Apostle
[48:43] Paul.
[48:45] And through all of the ages, there were
[48:48] people that received the word of God for
[48:52] their hour.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; And their voices, their lives
[48:58] join the voices of the millions that
[49:01] went before them.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And I today, I want to say, let my voice
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let my life be a witness
[49:12] &gt;&gt; of what God has done
[49:14] &gt;&gt; in this generation
[49:17] sir.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Horrific
[49:21] &gt;&gt; thing.
[49:23] And I pray for the uh the Kirk family.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; The wife and the young children.
[49:32] They're, you know, uh just a horrible
[49:36] thing. It is,
[49:38] &gt;&gt; but it's a spirit
[49:41] &gt;&gt; and it's permeating throughout the
[49:43] world. The world right now
[49:46] &gt;&gt; and you have got to be aware and
[49:49] understand the spiritual warfare that we
[49:52] are in
[49:53] &gt;&gt; and here in the midst of Laosa.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. Let's sing
[49:58] that song you were singing. Amen. Amen.
[50:02] Uh honor and glory and power to him.
[50:05] Amen.
[50:07] [Music]
[50:10] Amen means so be it.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Blessing and honor and glory and power.
[50:18] Amen.
[50:21] Amen.
[50:26] Amen.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Blessing and honor and glory and power.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; One more time. Echo. Lift your hand and
[50:36] sing a
[50:39] May our life and our voice say amen.
[50:46] Oh blessings and honor and glory and
[50:49] power.
[50:51] [Music]
[50:59] [Applause]
[51:02] blessing and honor and glory and power.
[51:06] Amen.
[51:08] [Music]
[51:10] &gt;&gt; And your voice with their voice says,
[51:15] "Amen." That means so be it.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[51:21] Lord, we join our voices
[51:25] with the voices down through the ages,
[51:29] the voice of many waters.
[51:32] of peoples and nations and tongues
[51:36] that have joined your voice and the same
[51:41] voice that was down through the
[51:43] messengers
[51:45] and they received that message. They
[51:48] then became the voice of that messenger
[51:52] until the final voice to the final age
[51:56] would be the bride. She's the evidence
[52:00] of the word.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Even as Sister Perfect sang that song,
[52:08] &gt;&gt; we are the evidence.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of what the
[52:15] word said would happen in this hour.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Father, we say so be it.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. May it be done according to
[52:25] us,
[52:27] according to thy word and promises.
[52:30] We thank you. We praise you,
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Father. Give us the courage, the
[52:35] strength to go forward,
[52:38] Lord.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; To be one of those. Let our voice be
[52:42] your voice.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Let our lives be reflective of your
[52:46] word.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray you'll bless each and
[52:50] everyone that is here this morning. and
[52:52] we ask you to do it for your glory in
[52:55] Jesus Christ's name.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you musicians. God bless you each
[53:06] and everyone. Just Amen. Let's just
[53:09] remain standing. Amen. And I feel
[53:12] something on my heart this morning to
[53:14] continue on. And I I think we'll try to
[53:18] sum it up in this service here with uh
[53:22] being wholly sanctified unto God. This
[53:25] is part two. 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.
[53:32] Brother Sean and Sister Janet. I bless
[53:35] you. should have you come up here and
[53:37] hug your neck and welcome you back, but
[53:40] I'll do that after service. We're so
[53:42] glad we miss you guys.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; You may think that you're
[53:47] not missed when you're not here,
[53:50] &gt;&gt; but you are.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget a little Navajo boy up
[53:55] on a reservation. He said, "My job was
[53:58] to watch over my father's sheep."
[54:01] And he said, "I had
[54:04] over 200 head of sheep." And he says, "I
[54:08] didn't count them."
[54:11] He said, "But when one was missing, I
[54:13] felt it."
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; I felt it.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; I said, "You mean to tell me you you
[54:21] didn't count? You didn't, you know, one,
[54:23] two, three, four, five. Oh, there's one
[54:24] missing." He said, "No, I just" And he
[54:27] said, "You may think they all look
[54:28] alike, but to a shepherd, they're all
[54:30] different."
[54:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Some walk different. Some hang on the
[54:35] outside of the crowd. Some stay close to
[54:38] the shepherd. Others like to stray a
[54:41] little bit.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; They're all different. But he says,
[54:47] "When they were missing, I felt it."
[54:50] &gt;&gt; "When you're missing,
[54:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; I feel it."
[54:54] Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you. 1 Thessalonians chapter 5
[55:01] verses 18- 24.
[55:06] In everything give thanks.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; For this is the will of God in Christ
[55:12] Jesus concerning you.
[55:15] Quench not the spirit.
[55:17] Despise not prophesyings.
[55:20] Prove all things.
[55:23] and hold fast that which is good.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Abstain from all appearance of evil.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you
[55:35] holy. That means in every part,
[55:39] &gt;&gt; in every phase, in its entire May the
[55:42] God of peace sanctify you entirely.
[55:46] Amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; And I pray God your whole spirit
[55:53] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[55:58] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
[56:01] Christ.
[56:03] Amen. Faithful is he that calleth you
[56:08] who also will do it.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews Hebrews chapter 4.
[56:27] Amen. Thank you.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:41] Hebrews 4
[56:44] and verse 12.
[56:47] Now, I want you to notice what the Bible
[56:49] says concerning the word of God.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; And I I want to take you and put this
[56:56] into your remembrance that if God sends
[56:59] a word in this hour,
[57:03] it's the sword of the spirit.
[57:06] It was symbolized by sword coming into
[57:09] the prophet's
[57:11] hand
[57:14] and said this is the third pull
[57:19] &gt;&gt; and its effect
[57:23] is going to be
[57:25] dividing us under.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Catch this now. Only
[57:31] this word that is in the hand of the
[57:33] prophet
[57:35] though you see all manifestations you
[57:37] see all kinds of gifts. You see all
[57:39] kinds of healings and miracles and
[57:41] ministries and so on and so forth.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said you don't
[57:46] judge them you know uh by their works
[57:50] because many will do wonderful works in
[57:53] his name cast out devils in his name. do
[57:55] all this stuff and he will say unto some
[57:58] of them, depart from me, you workers of
[58:01] iniquity. That's knowing what's right to
[58:03] do, but they don't do it.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; So, he doesn't deny the works that they
[58:10] do.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Their hearts are far from
[58:14] me. In vain do they worship me, teaching
[58:17] for doctrine the commandments of men."
[58:20] Now watch this word of God, this message
[58:23] of the hour divides us under
[58:27] &gt;&gt; even to the point where that one
[58:29] minister,
[58:31] a prominent Pentecostal minister
[58:35] brought his wife up to be introduced to
[58:38] brother Brennham and he said she is a
[58:41] real saint.
[58:44] And when she was brought up there before
[58:47] brother Brennham, now I want you to
[58:50] understand he wasn't just looking at the
[58:52] outside, but he had a gift of
[58:54] discernment. How many know that?
[58:57] &gt;&gt; He had a gift of discernment.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; And
[59:03] what he did is he he saw that it was a
[59:07] religious facade.
[59:13] the outward.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Many honorth me with their
[59:17] lips."
[59:20] &gt;&gt; But their hearts be far from me.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; And he saw this and now he's dividing us
[59:29] under.
[59:30] He said, "You may have it on your body
[59:32] and on your spirit, but your soul
[59:37] &gt;&gt; because the control room would manifest
[59:41] the word of God in your life."
[59:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "You say you have the Holy
[59:46] Ghost?"
[59:48] He said, "How can you have the Holy
[59:50] Ghost and go contrary to he that is the
[59:53] author of the word?"
[59:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "It can't be." Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; He said it might be a religious spirit.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; You say I might have shook, jumped,
[1:00:05] shouted, prophesied, preached. I might
[1:00:08] have cast out. He said that don't
[1:00:09] matter.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "What I want to see is a
[1:00:15] manifestation of the word in your life."
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; And thank God that we have had a message
[1:00:20] that's come to help us to discern and to
[1:00:24] divide us under. Yes.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; So, watch this. Hebrews 4 and12.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; For the word of God is quick and
[1:00:37] powerful
[1:00:38] and sharper than any two-edged sword,
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; piercing even to the dividing aunder
[1:00:47] of soul and spirit, showing you can it
[1:00:51] divides us under. You can have the Holy
[1:00:53] Spirit on your spirit. activate the
[1:00:55] gifts of the spirit, prophesy, speak in
[1:00:58] tongues, dance in the spirit,
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; and do all of those things. And he says,
[1:01:03] "But it's not in your soul,
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; I know that's hard to take for some, but
[1:01:11] this is your word."
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Or his word.
[1:01:15] and of the joints and the mouth
[1:01:19] and as a discerner
[1:01:21] of the thoughts and intents
[1:01:25] of the heart. May God add the blessing
[1:01:27] to the reading of his word this morning.
[1:01:29] You may be seated. Amen.
[1:01:41] All right. Um,
[1:01:44] I'm titling this being wholly sanctified
[1:01:47] unto God, part two.
[1:01:50] And I want to take a subject this
[1:01:52] morning that is affecting every one of
[1:01:54] you.
[1:01:57] I want to talk about mind battles.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Mind battles. Every one of you are going
[1:02:04] to go through this.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; You're going to be tested and tried.
[1:02:09] Things are going to happen.
[1:02:11] Even brother Brennham was asked the
[1:02:13] question, how do I know when these
[1:02:16] thoughts that are coming to me and they
[1:02:17] bombber? How do I know if it's my
[1:02:20] thoughts or is it the devil putting the
[1:02:23] thoughts into your mind? Now understand
[1:02:25] brother Brent's doctrinal teaching. He
[1:02:27] said Satan cannot read your mind.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; He says he waits until you speak what's
[1:02:34] affecting you. Then he knows if you're
[1:02:37] receiving his transmission or not. Now
[1:02:40] he says, "You take the shield of faith
[1:02:43] whereby you quench the fiery darts which
[1:02:45] are evil thoughts
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; whereby you quench the fiery darts that
[1:02:54] are coming toward you."
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham, are those my
[1:02:57] thoughts or are those the thoughts of
[1:03:00] the enemy? Because I don't know. And he
[1:03:02] says, well, take it back to the word. If
[1:03:05] whatsoever is pure, holy, virtuous,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; think on these things. But if it's not,
[1:03:10] it's just the devil. He said, you cannot
[1:03:13] stop
[1:03:15] a a a bird from flying over your head.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Huh? The thoughts coming. He said, but
[1:03:22] you can stop it from making a nest.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Some of you allow him to land and make a
[1:03:27] nest, and then you get all
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; upset and wondered, "Are these my
[1:03:32] thoughts? Oh, I guess I'm not even a
[1:03:34] Christian. Who? Boohoo. And you cry and
[1:03:36] moan and this and that. And you're a
[1:03:38] lukewarm Christian. Am I? Am I? Am I
[1:03:41] not? Am I bride? Am I not? The Bible
[1:03:43] says, "Make your calling and your
[1:03:45] election sure."
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Many are called, but few are chosen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; So, we have come here to make ourselves
[1:03:54] certain of what we believe.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] Yes, sir.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; I believe that God is calling all of us
[1:04:02] to a higher calling
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; to a greater sanctification
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And remember now that Brother Brennham
[1:04:12] teaches and if we could, we got a new
[1:04:15] graph that was sent that's a little bit
[1:04:16] more legible than my poor I listen I'm
[1:04:20] not one of these guys that knows how to
[1:04:23] put all this stuff. So, I have to I have
[1:04:26] to take a photo, take the photo, print
[1:04:29] it out, then I have to write on it. Then
[1:04:31] I have to take a photo of my writing.
[1:04:33] And that's how I do it. But some people
[1:04:35] are good enough. They they can go ahead
[1:04:37] and do they know how to make circles and
[1:04:39] all of that. I don't.
[1:04:42] So, Brother Brennham says, notice that
[1:04:46] the three-fold nature of man, he talks
[1:04:49] about the body and the spirit and the
[1:04:53] soul. And he says, "Now to even better
[1:04:55] understand
[1:04:57] how that you are a tabernacle of God,
[1:05:00] you have to look at the tabernacle in
[1:05:02] heaven
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; and the tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; because the outer court, inner court,
[1:05:08] holy of holies, he said that's a type of
[1:05:11] you."
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; You understand? Now, we're not going to
[1:05:17] go into that depth of teaching on that,
[1:05:19] but understand there's many people that
[1:05:21] come to the outer court, and that's as
[1:05:23] far as they go.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; And then there are others that come into
[1:05:26] the holy place,
[1:05:29] but there's very few that come into the
[1:05:31] holy of holies.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Now, that's where we want to go. And
[1:05:35] you've got to be anointed.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; You've got to be walking right, talking
[1:05:39] right. Huh?
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; The high priest. Huh? And we have a high
[1:05:44] priest that has gone before us. And
[1:05:46] because of his blood on us, we can enter
[1:05:49] in beyond the veil.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have a right. Why?
[1:05:53] Because he made a way.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; So, we got to be walking, talking,
[1:06:02] anointed. Huh? Not just with a a a
[1:06:05] little sprinkling,
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; but they poured the oil upon Aaron's
[1:06:09] head and it dripped down from his head.
[1:06:12] his hair on through his beard onto his
[1:06:15] clothing.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, don't just give me a
[1:06:19] little sprinkling. Give me a full
[1:06:21] baptism.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; I don't want just a portion. God,
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; saturate me.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; So, go ahead and keep that graph up for
[1:06:35] just a second. Let me just very quickly
[1:06:37] go over a couple simple things.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; I've got this. Okay. So,
[1:06:42] we see that Hebrews 4:12, the word of
[1:06:45] God is sharp
[1:06:47] as a two-edged sword. And we see
[1:06:50] justification is just the outer court.
[1:06:53] Brother Brandham also calls it the
[1:06:54] living room. He calls it the carnal man,
[1:06:56] the natural man.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And understand that the first doctrine
[1:07:01] of Jesus Christ was you must be born
[1:07:04] again.
[1:07:06] Because all of you now we understand
[1:07:08] this that we came into this world
[1:07:11] without our theophony.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; We bypassed it.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; So you come here with a carnal body and
[1:07:20] you came into the world speaking lies.
[1:07:22] Nobody taught you how to be worldly.
[1:07:26] Why? You were born with a worldly
[1:07:28] nature.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell children how to
[1:07:31] lie or teach them. They know how to lie.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; And it's so funny. They can lie to your
[1:07:36] face and they can have evidence all over
[1:07:38] them and they will try to get you to
[1:07:40] believe them.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Have any of you had your children to
[1:07:45] lie?
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, mommy, I never did that. I I
[1:07:50] wouldn't do that.
[1:07:53] My son Aus reached out, grabbed a cake,
[1:07:57] took the frosting.
[1:07:59] He ate it up. It was all over his mouth,
[1:08:01] his fingers.
[1:08:04] And Sandy came in and said, "Amos, did
[1:08:06] you get into that cake?" "No, I promise
[1:08:09] you, Mommy, I didn't do it."
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:14] And and they'll look straight in your
[1:08:17] face and
[1:08:19] lie to you. Why? It was a nature.
[1:08:22] Brother Brennham said, "Satan is your
[1:08:25] nearer kinsman."
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's why you've got to
[1:08:29] be born again." And Nicodemus tried to
[1:08:32] understand, "What do you mean born
[1:08:33] again? Do I enter back into my mother's
[1:08:35] womb?" He said, "No, for that which is
[1:08:37] born of the flesh is flesh."
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; So to be carnally minded is emnity with
[1:08:43] God. Neither can it understand the
[1:08:45] things of God. That's why this carnal
[1:08:48] man out here, the flesh man, he doesn't
[1:08:51] understand the things of God. And he's
[1:08:53] got five gates here, uh, see, smell, uh,
[1:08:58] hear, and taste, and touch. And
[1:09:02] everything that he surrounds himself in
[1:09:05] this world to be able to understand this
[1:09:10] realm that he's in, he uses one or all
[1:09:13] five of those gates.
[1:09:16] So, but God doesn't use any of those.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; We walk by faith and not by
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; sight.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; We have something far greater. Stop here
[1:09:27] for a moment.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam said, "When God opens
[1:09:30] your eyes of the spirit, it's a far
[1:09:34] greater eyesight than physical."
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "When God allows you to
[1:09:40] hear what the spirit is saying, you've
[1:09:42] got a far greater ear than the
[1:09:45] physical." Because, well, did Isaiah
[1:09:47] prophesy, "They have ears to hear, but
[1:09:50] they hear not. They have eyes to see,
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; but they see not."
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; But blessed are you. Let me tell you, my
[1:09:57] brother, my sister, I will declare unto
[1:09:59] you, you are of all people on this earth
[1:10:02] most blessed. If God has opened your
[1:10:05] eyes,
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; it wasn't William Brandham.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't teachers.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; It wasn't ministry.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; It was him.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Just like he did on the road to Emmas.
[1:10:21] He broke the bread. What was the bread
[1:10:23] he broke?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; It's not physical bread. I am the bread
[1:10:26] which came down from heaven. Your
[1:10:28] fathers ate that bread and every one of
[1:10:31] them are dead. Right.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "Eat. This is my body.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; I am the bread which came down from
[1:10:38] heaven."
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And when he that day took their bread
[1:10:42] and he break it, their eyes came open.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; And then they saw him.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Now there are times when God breaks the
[1:10:53] bread of life to you, which is the word,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; and your eyes come open to it and you
[1:10:59] see him. You see him manifesting himself
[1:11:02] through scriptures and it it illuminates
[1:11:05] your understanding and you have one of
[1:11:07] those aha moments
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; and you go, "Wow,
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; that is so good." But what God does
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; just like he did on the road to Emmas,
[1:11:16] he did not stay there and elaborate.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; What did he do?
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; He moves back into that invisible realm.
[1:11:30] Understand that God comes down and
[1:11:33] illuminates you periodically.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; You're going through something.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; You're going through a trial something
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; and you're wondering why why am I why is
[1:11:42] this happening? Thinking not strange
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; as though these trials are coming
[1:11:48] against you that God maybe doesn't love
[1:11:50] you or or why me?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; He's doing it to watch your reaction.
[1:12:00] So now
[1:12:02] I want to not take a lot of time and
[1:12:06] expound
[1:12:07] here on the body man, the carnal man.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:12:14] we know that the rain falls on the just
[1:12:17] and the unjust.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham had this come to him
[1:12:22] after he'd gone to the first Pentecostal
[1:12:24] meeting in Mishawaka. Yes.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; And he and you all know the moving of
[1:12:29] the spirit and people one stand up and
[1:12:31] prophesy another interpret it. Right?
[1:12:35] Which is prophecy. Tongues
[1:12:36] interpretation is prophecy.
[1:12:39] And he said, "Oh my, it must be among
[1:12:41] angels." They ask him, "Do you have the
[1:12:43] Holy Spirit? I ain't got what you got."
[1:12:46] Okay. Now, so he he says, "Oh, I just
[1:12:49] couldn't wait to shake their hands."
[1:12:51] Now, you all know he had a gift in his
[1:12:53] hand.
[1:12:55] And as he shook one hand just as true
[1:12:57] blue why he was just a real solid
[1:13:00] Christian. He said and I shook the other
[1:13:03] man's hand. He said boy if I ever met a
[1:13:05] hypocrite he was one.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; And you all know. So now he himself a
[1:13:10] prophet of God is questioning am I among
[1:13:13] angels or devils.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; How do I discern?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Because I remember the first time I ever
[1:13:20] listened to the anointed ones at the end
[1:13:23] time. And brother Bram talks about the
[1:13:25] false anointed ones. And I always in my
[1:13:29] immature thinking was that the anointing
[1:13:33] on false seed was a false anointing.
[1:13:38] Brother Brennham said, "Oh no,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; the same rain, the same Holy Spirit that
[1:13:44] reigns on the just reigns on the unjust
[1:13:47] is not the cockab. It wasn't wheat."
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Because you don't change
[1:13:55] the seed that's inside you.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; The new birth does not change you from
[1:14:05] cocker to wheat.
[1:14:07] You always were weak.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; And because you are of seed, you have
[1:14:13] the ability to be reborn. Because in non
[1:14:16] seed, there's nothing to quicken.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Same word.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Same anointing. And they feel it and
[1:14:24] they jump and they shout.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "But it's the rain on the just
[1:14:30] and the unjust."
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; We're seeing, "Will I not pour out of my
[1:14:35] spirit upon all flesh?" Somebody say,
[1:14:37] "All flesh."
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; All,
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; good or bad.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what they believe and
[1:14:43] whether they're justified, sanctified,
[1:14:46] they feel his presence. And I'm not
[1:14:49] saying that that's not God's presence.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:14:59] let me get back to my notes here.
[1:15:04] The reason that we are having the
[1:15:07] problem among youth, youth,
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; yes, all of us have problems, but we're
[1:15:13] talking about right now. Your children
[1:15:15] are at risk.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; It's the young people.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Most of you older ones, huh? You're old
[1:15:21] enough. You've been there.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; You're experienced enough. But your
[1:15:24] kids,
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; oh God, help us.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. to have our children have an
[1:15:32] understanding of the spiritual warfare
[1:15:34] they're in.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; And the reason we are having the violent
[1:15:39] behavior
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; among young children is brother Brennham
[1:15:44] said they have meggaosed
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; upon violence in movies.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; The reason they have premarital sex, he
[1:15:52] said they see it on television and
[1:15:54] movies, on billboards.
[1:15:56] And he says, "What's happening is you're
[1:15:59] putting thoughts into their mind."
[1:16:01] Thoughts see,
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; you're putting thoughts into their mind.
[1:16:06] And so now, unless they understand
[1:16:10] spiritual warfare,
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; they don't fight against it. Well,
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; I guess it's normal. Everybody's doing
[1:16:17] it.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Might as well. Okay. What we need is the
[1:16:24] Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Here among us
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; and teach it to your children. You must
[1:16:31] be born again and go on unto the baptism
[1:16:34] of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost baptism is a
[1:16:40] process.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Doesn't come immediately.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:16:46] you believe?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll go into that.
[1:16:53] I want to ask you who rates the movies
[1:16:56] and how do they rate them? Are they Holy
[1:16:59] Ghost filled Christians? It's
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; ah they're worldly. So how do they rate
[1:17:04] it? Sex, violence.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Huh? Profanity.
[1:17:11] And so you'll never have an Academy
[1:17:15] Award
[1:17:16] or a film to become popular unless it's
[1:17:20] filled with several of those things.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Okay? And so now the devil is using this
[1:17:30] to permeate the minds of the youth.
[1:17:34] Yeah.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; So
[1:17:40] I want you to understand that we fight
[1:17:42] not against flesh and blood
[1:17:45] but against principalities and powers.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Satan
[1:17:51] is an almighty power.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. He's a mighty power.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; But God's almighty.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; And some of you may think that you just
[1:18:07] have to say boo to the devil and he'll
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; he'll go away from you.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; You can scream and holler all you want,
[1:18:17] but if you're not behind the fortitude
[1:18:20] of the word of God,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Satan can come at you.
[1:18:24] Brother Brennham said, "You go out here
[1:18:26] and you do wrong and you do something
[1:18:28] wrong unless it and and you never
[1:18:30] confess the sin. It stays there. It
[1:18:32] becomes a stronghold. And then you
[1:18:34] wonder why you can't overcome the things
[1:18:36] you're over trying to overcome. Why
[1:18:39] they're overcoming you, why you're
[1:18:41] losing the battle.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you just come up
[1:18:46] here. We'll lay hands on you. I have a
[1:18:48] right. I command you, Satan, to come out
[1:18:51] of them." Brother Bram said, "They come
[1:18:54] up here and want me to pray for them."
[1:18:56] And he said, "If they have got
[1:18:58] unconfessed sin, that devil has a right
[1:19:00] to stay right there.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; I can pray for two, three days anointed
[1:19:04] with oil and that thing, that demon will
[1:19:07] laugh to your face."
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Now understand strongholds and every one
[1:19:12] of you. I have never met a
[1:19:14] demon-possessed person. Not obsessed but
[1:19:18] possessed.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; When a demon takes possession of a
[1:19:23] physical body.
[1:19:27] I have never met a demon-possessed
[1:19:30] person and counseledled with them. But
[1:19:33] what they knew immediately when they
[1:19:35] took the spirit,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; you can ask them in the name of Jesus
[1:19:40] Christ, I ask you, do you know when you
[1:19:42] opened the door? Yes, I do.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; And it came in
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; and I did this. And unless you because
[1:19:51] the Bible says that that our word of God
[1:19:54] is not carnal
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; but is mighty and powerful to the
[1:19:58] pulling down of strongholds.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Now some spirits do not come out except
[1:20:04] by prayer and
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; it's not the minister to pray and fast.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; It's the person you're having a problem.
[1:20:13] Get on your knees.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Fast. Ask God why am I going through
[1:20:18] this? Why is this such a problem for me?
[1:20:21] Why can't I overcome? Get on your knees,
[1:20:24] fast, and pray. God will show you if
[1:20:26] you're honest.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said, "In the voice of
[1:20:35] God, in these last days,
[1:20:38] Moses heard the voice of God. He was
[1:20:40] full of theology.
[1:20:43] He knowed all the ins and outs, but it
[1:20:46] failed. He heard the voice of God. Moses
[1:20:50] was never the same
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; and no man is ever the same. So now he
[1:20:56] goes from Moses to no man.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; You might hear in your ears the voice
[1:21:00] speaking, but when you hear in your
[1:21:02] heart the voice speaking. See, then
[1:21:05] you're hearing.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; You do not see with your eye. You look
[1:21:10] with your eyes, but you see with your
[1:21:12] heart. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; You see something, say, "I don't see
[1:21:17] it." You mean, "I don't understand it."
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; You don't hear with your ears, you hear
[1:21:23] with your heart. Many times your ears
[1:21:26] hear the true voice of God. And it falls
[1:21:29] off you like water off a duck's back.
[1:21:32] But when you really hear, you hear with
[1:21:35] your heart.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Oh God, don't let our people
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; just hear
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; and it has no effect.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; But God, may you open the ears of our
[1:21:50] heart.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I don't want it to be lip service.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:22:02] I don't want to spend much time on the
[1:22:04] body
[1:22:05] as I told you that the natural birth now
[1:22:08] consists of water, blood and spirit. But
[1:22:12] now let's take it just a little bit
[1:22:15] further for just a moment because you
[1:22:17] have to have conception.
[1:22:20] There is no birth without conception.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; So there's pregnantation.
[1:22:25] Okay. Seed is germatized.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Now, does every woman that becomes
[1:22:31] pregnant have a child?
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; So now there's a process. We know
[1:22:37] biologically and according to medical
[1:22:39] science, there's three trimesters.
[1:22:43] But if something happens
[1:22:46] to that seed, it can be aborted.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] It can maybe go through nine months of
[1:22:56] growth and still come forth and have no
[1:22:59] life.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; There is a term for that and it's called
[1:23:05] stillborn.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Horrible thing.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said the sweetest sound to
[1:23:14] any mother is directly after giving
[1:23:18] birth.
[1:23:20] is that the is the cry of their child.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:23:32] um so you have conception. She is
[1:23:34] germatized. She becomes pregnant. Her
[1:23:37] tastes change, things change. She used
[1:23:40] to like ice cream. Now she likes
[1:23:41] pickles.
[1:23:45] But there is something that can happen.
[1:23:48] Either you've hurt the fetus and it's
[1:23:51] called a miscarriage
[1:23:54] or it can go full term, she's carried at
[1:23:57] nine months actually come up to the
[1:24:00] point of having birth pains
[1:24:04] and
[1:24:06] there are some within our congregation
[1:24:09] that this has happened to. And I humble
[1:24:12] myself. I am not I am saying it's one of
[1:24:16] probably the most painful thing, hurtful
[1:24:20] things to a woman
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; because she comes after having given
[1:24:25] birth, she comes back to church and she
[1:24:28] has no baby in her arms.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; So
[1:24:35] then after delivery there must be the
[1:24:39] breath of life.
[1:24:41] You understand that
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; conception
[1:24:44] period of trimesters
[1:24:48] and then if everything goes well you can
[1:24:51] give birth go through the labor pains
[1:24:54] but praise God there must be the breath
[1:24:56] of life.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] Now, brother Brennham says in the basis
[1:25:02] of fellowship, follow along. Now,
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; the basis of fellowship, when a baby's
[1:25:07] born, there's three elements. It comes
[1:25:09] from for the baby's life. What's the
[1:25:12] first thing? Excuse me, sisters. What's
[1:25:14] the first thing? Come water. If it
[1:25:17] isn't, it's a dry birth. The baby's in
[1:25:20] uh not normal. Second thing, blood.
[1:25:24] Okay, come on. Follow along with me,
[1:25:26] brethren. So, you got to stay right on
[1:25:28] top of this with me because I got I got
[1:25:30] a lot of going to get through. What's
[1:25:32] the next thing? Life.
[1:25:35] What come from Jesus? Water, blood, and
[1:25:38] life. Do you know what happened at
[1:25:40] Calvary? Brother Rem said he birthed the
[1:25:42] whole New Testament church.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; That seed gene of God there gave up his
[1:25:48] life. And when he did, now the life,
[1:25:51] excuse me, the seed except it die abides
[1:25:56] alone.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And here the firstborn, the only
[1:26:00] begotten son of God.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; And he, brother Abraham said,
[1:26:05] everything, every seed gene of God was
[1:26:08] in him.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And there he gave up the ghost. He died.
[1:26:13] Now Satan thought, I got him. It's done.
[1:26:16] It's over. This heretic, this man, I I
[1:26:20] I've killed him. What he did, he just
[1:26:23] birthed him in a whole another way.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Water, blood, spirit.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; What came forth? The whole New Testament
[1:26:32] church
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; poured out his blood upon the earth.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; And there, brother Ram said, he spilled
[1:26:40] out his seed upon the earth.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Do you see? He was birthing the church.
[1:26:48] Now, Brother Bram said,
[1:26:52] "If a baby's born and he's still born,
[1:26:55] he doesn't cry.
[1:26:57] There's no emotion to him. What's the
[1:26:59] matter with him? He's a deadorn baby."
[1:27:03] All right, if you guys stay with me now,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; that's what's the matter with the
[1:27:07] churches today. What's wrong with our
[1:27:09] Pentecostals?
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; We're bringing forth too many deadborn
[1:27:13] babies.
[1:27:15] Exactly right. Exactly right. What do
[1:27:19] you do with a baby if he's still born
[1:27:21] like that? You just take him by the
[1:27:24] heels, raise him up, give him a good
[1:27:26] little posterior protoplasm stimulation
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; and just as hard as you can and that
[1:27:33] fixes him up. And if anything the church
[1:27:36] needs tonight, it's a good old-fashioned
[1:27:39] gospel spanking with the power of the
[1:27:41] Holy Ghost.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; I don't want to see you come to church
[1:27:50] and you are without emotion.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Is he done yet?
[1:28:05] Some of you have a resurrection factor
[1:28:08] when I say I'm closing.
[1:28:13] Get your purse. Get your kids. You're
[1:28:15] already You're already thinking where
[1:28:17] you're going.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; You come alive after I say in closing.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; I don't want Now here I am saying with
[1:28:26] all of you. I'm not here to try to get
[1:28:28] you emotionally worked up. No.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; But I want to see you have some life
[1:28:34] when the word of God goes forth
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; to it stimulate you enough. Brother Ron,
[1:28:41] you you said something the other day
[1:28:43] that almost almost got me to say amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Well, why don't you let go and let God
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; say
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Preach, brother.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; It's like a birth.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; It hurts and it
[1:29:02] feel a whole lot better, man.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to let it out.
[1:29:09] Sometimes you got to break the sound
[1:29:11] barrier because when you break the sound
[1:29:13] barrier, it's unlimited.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; You think you want more power of God,
[1:29:17] open your mouth and begin to praise God
[1:29:21] for what you got.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Some of you
[1:29:34] I have yet to see
[1:29:37] get beside yourself.
[1:29:41] I wonder
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; and then I I'm thinking some of you got
[1:29:46] complexes.
[1:29:48] You're so unique
[1:29:50] and you're afraid
[1:29:52] or maybe you got a complex maybe people
[1:29:55] will think I'm I'm odd
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; or I'm weird.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Who cares?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; You are weird.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; You are unique. Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible calls you a peculiar people.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Wow. Brother Ron the other day.
[1:30:16] Oh, it was so good. I almost
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Well, quit saying almost.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sister. You can say amen. Yes,
[1:30:24] brother. If you're a young man, yes, you
[1:30:27] can. You can't stand up and say praise
[1:30:29] God. Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; See, you sit there in church with no
[1:30:34] emotions, no nothing. Year by year,
[1:30:37] everything I'm thinking, my what in the
[1:30:38] world is going to get you to get stirred
[1:30:41] up
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; fire.
[1:30:47] Don't yell fire in a crowded.
[1:30:55] I was the shop assistant in beginning
[1:30:58] electronics.
[1:31:01] And
[1:31:03] so I was allowed into the back room
[1:31:04] where I had all of the electrical stuff
[1:31:07] and shocking stuff. And we had an
[1:31:10] ionizer.
[1:31:12] It's it's a looked like a big pencil
[1:31:15] with a end on it.
[1:31:18] And
[1:31:19] so you could take it's a long deal like
[1:31:22] this. And you you plugged it in And when
[1:31:25] you got close to something that was
[1:31:27] metal, there'd be an electrical charge
[1:31:30] that you'd see this current go
[1:31:34] kind of like these science
[1:31:36] Frankenstein. It's alive
[1:31:40] and so like this. So I thought, man,
[1:31:44] this is this is so good. There there
[1:31:46] there
[1:31:48] was one girl in class and she was just
[1:31:50] the studious type and she she just stood
[1:31:53] there with her or sat there all the time
[1:31:54] with her little smirk and never you know
[1:31:56] there was nothing come out of her but
[1:31:58] she was just a a real now nothing wrong
[1:32:00] with studious kids but anyway
[1:32:05] I I had a couple other guys I said okay
[1:32:07] see this electric electrical wire take
[1:32:10] it and hook it to her chair
[1:32:14] and it had a wooden seat with metal
[1:32:16] grommets that held the talk.
[1:32:20] And I said, "Watch as a teacher." And I
[1:32:23] went into the back room. Nobody could
[1:32:24] see me. And so the teacher is teaching
[1:32:28] and all of a sudden I turn it on
[1:32:32] and the end of the wire
[1:32:35] when I got close enough and I hear
[1:32:42] I get sent to the office.
[1:32:46] But sometimes I'm wondering,
[1:32:49] "Oh God, what is it going to take
[1:32:52] to get you once in a while, I'm not
[1:32:54] talking about all the time, and I'm not
[1:32:56] talking about you getting up and acting
[1:32:58] crazy, but I will say this. When the
[1:33:00] Holy Spirit really comes upon you,
[1:33:02] it'll, Brother Brent says, cause you to
[1:33:05] act unsemly.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:14] Yeah. Yeah. You might get out of
[1:33:17] character a little bit. Now, Brother
[1:33:19] Bram said, "Then uh spoken word is the
[1:33:23] original seed." Are we together,
[1:33:24] brother? Okay, there we go. Good. Let's
[1:33:26] follow along. Now, she left Jesus, the
[1:33:29] word, the word, and married another man
[1:33:32] called the Pope with dogma.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; And she hasn't got Jesus, she's got a
[1:33:39] pope. Right.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; See, the Protestant hasn't got Jetus
[1:33:43] Jesus. It's got a denomination. Same
[1:33:46] thing.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; An image unto the beast. So, she can't
[1:33:51] give a word birth. Now, here's the
[1:33:54] prophet bringing a terminology that
[1:33:56] we've never heard up until now.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; A word birth. Oh, they've had a birth,
[1:34:02] all right, but it wasn't a birth of the
[1:34:04] word. It was a birth of denomination.
[1:34:06] Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Because everything will bring forth of
[1:34:09] its own kind,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; So he says she can't give a word birth
[1:34:16] to her children, none of them. She is a
[1:34:19] harlot herself. The Bible said she had a
[1:34:22] cup in her hand. She was given out her
[1:34:24] doctrine to the people which was an
[1:34:26] abomination, the filthiness of her
[1:34:28] fornication. What is fornication? It's
[1:34:31] living unclean. and for her doctrine
[1:34:34] she's giving to the people is the
[1:34:36] filthiness of her fornications
[1:34:39] made drunk with the wine of her
[1:34:41] fornication. Now follow along. He takes
[1:34:44] this same thought and elaborates on this
[1:34:47] in the sermon birth pains.
[1:34:50] Now he says notice quickly now she in
[1:34:55] that stage beyond a shadow of doubt
[1:34:57] we're in the Ladyan church age. Now her
[1:35:00] messenger has promised in Malachi the
[1:35:02] 4th chapter he's promised to do it. The
[1:35:05] message is to bring back the word bring
[1:35:07] the people back to a word birth.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Is to be she is to be delivered of a new
[1:35:13] birth from according to Malachi 4.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Now he said there are two systems
[1:35:19] working in the church world today
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; in the church. Two two spirits.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Two systems.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. both religious.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get this off my shoulder.
[1:35:37] Then I have it over with.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; We all know that the word that's the
[1:35:41] word of God and the denominational
[1:35:43] system. Two different. There's the true
[1:35:46] system at work just as they was Jacob
[1:35:49] and Esau. One after the spirit, the one
[1:35:52] and another one after the flesh. What is
[1:35:56] it? Esau and Jacob was fighting in the
[1:35:58] wombs of the mother even to the time
[1:36:02] they were born. And so is the
[1:36:03] denominationals and the word fighting
[1:36:06] one against the other. See now this end
[1:36:09] time message I want you to understand is
[1:36:13] a word given to the church
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; to bring forth a word birth. Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "You preach
[1:36:22] Pentecostal doctrine, you bring forth
[1:36:24] Pentecostal children. You preach
[1:36:26] Lutheran doctrine, you bring Lutheran
[1:36:28] children."
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; You understand? If you teach them how to
[1:36:32] be religious, our father who art in
[1:36:34] heaven, hallowed be thy name, they say
[1:36:36] prayers and don't pray.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; They have a religious
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; way about them.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Outwardly
[1:36:48] they have a religious facade.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Hail Mary, mother of God.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; They have a religion.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; And according
[1:37:04] to their taste,
[1:37:06] they will find a church that will
[1:37:08] satisfy their worldly taste.
[1:37:15] True.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; When you choose a church, choose one
[1:37:20] that's
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; wordbased.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Not just a feel-good church. Not there
[1:37:27] just well, it was so good and our
[1:37:28] singing and our worship and everything,
[1:37:30] but what about the lives of the people?
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:37:38] So the end time message then
[1:37:42] is the word of God as a sharp two-edged
[1:37:45] sword. Now
[1:37:47] the reason that in the 50s they wanted
[1:37:51] to shoot brother Brennham out of the
[1:37:53] pulpit
[1:37:55] was because he's exposing blasphemous
[1:37:57] names.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Jezebel religion.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; He's exposing church entity.
[1:38:06] They hated him for
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; and the only reason that so much of the
[1:38:13] time they couldn't get to him is because
[1:38:16] he had an angel stand between
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; you come on up here. You want to prove
[1:38:25] me wrong?
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Come on up here. Bring your Bible. Stand
[1:38:28] here right next to me. Yeah.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; If I'm wrong, may God strike me dead
[1:38:35] right here in the in this pulpit. You
[1:38:38] that you you talk about a prove me wrong
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; statement.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "May God strike me dead if I'm
[1:38:46] wrong."
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Now, you bring your Bible up here
[1:38:49] because you that been on my back all
[1:38:51] this about water baptism, baptism of the
[1:38:54] Holy Ghost. And he goes on and on. He
[1:38:57] said, "Come up here and stand." He said,
[1:38:59] "Not one of them moved." He said,
[1:39:01] 'You're smarter than I thought.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; He said, 'You know, the angel of the
[1:39:06] Lord is standing directly to my right.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; They couldn't get to him.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Even when that maniac,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to break every bone in your
[1:39:21] body. And he said, mine, that guy's a
[1:39:23] big old guy. He could have done it.
[1:39:26] Brother Rem said, "I just stood there. I
[1:39:29] let him come. I'm gonna" and he's
[1:39:32] screaming and yelling. He's foaming at
[1:39:34] the man. This guy is upset. I'm going to
[1:39:36] break every bone in your body.
[1:39:40] He's got a devil.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; He let him come. Come right there.
[1:39:48] He said, "I rebuke you in the name of
[1:39:51] Jesus Christ."
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "You'll gravel at my feet.
[1:39:56] The man fell at his feet.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; You don't mess with God.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid to stand there. Okay.
[1:40:11] He said one day, mark it down. He said,
[1:40:15] "I believe they'll shoot me."
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? This is 1950s.
[1:40:21] 50s. This is not 2025.
[1:40:26] This is in the 50s.
[1:40:28] He hasn't even come to the full
[1:40:30] manifestation of the third pole in his
[1:40:33] own ministry.
[1:40:36] He's just out there performing a sign
[1:40:38] talking about Jesus Christ the same
[1:40:40] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:40:42] Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new.
[1:40:47] So,
[1:40:49] let's go. So now if you have
[1:40:53] uh this the
[1:40:56] this one here remember the gifts in the
[1:40:58] body. Do you do you have that? Can you
[1:41:00] show me that?
[1:41:04] So we'll take a moment here for just a
[1:41:07] second
[1:41:08] because we want to look at the gifts in
[1:41:10] the body.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now remember the body. Now
[1:41:15] understand this. Gifts and callings are
[1:41:18] what?
[1:41:20] If you got a gift of speaking in
[1:41:22] tongues, you had it before you got
[1:41:24] converted. That's
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Prophecy,
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; healing, knowledge, those things. What
[1:41:29] is it? Gifts and callings are without
[1:41:33] repentance. You had it there. The only
[1:41:36] thing is once you got born again and you
[1:41:39] come into the knowledge of gifts and the
[1:41:42] Holy Spirit anoints it, it activates
[1:41:44] that gift.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you have here according to
[1:41:50] Romans 12 4-9 you see the gift of
[1:41:54] exhorting or the gift of teaching the
[1:41:56] gift of prophecy the gift of ministry
[1:41:59] the gift of ruling the gift of giving
[1:42:01] the gift of mercy the gift of
[1:42:03] governments and the gift of helps those
[1:42:06] are gifts within the body
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; that is in I want to say the spirit
[1:42:12] realm
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; spirit realm
[1:42:17] So according to 1 Corinthians 12 8-10,
[1:42:21] you have discerning of spirits,
[1:42:24] you have interpretation of tongues, you
[1:42:27] have knowledge, you have prophecy, you
[1:42:30] have wisdom, you have faith,
[1:42:33] you have healing, you have miracles, and
[1:42:35] you have tongues.
[1:42:37] And brother Brandham said, I have seen
[1:42:39] them all being operated.
[1:42:43] They are gifts of the spirit and the
[1:42:44] holy spirit operating in that gift and
[1:42:48] they can and will prophesy and will be
[1:42:51] correct.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; And he said yet their soul is not
[1:42:57] anointed
[1:42:59] and had the Holy Spirit come and sit on
[1:43:01] the throne room. That's why their lives
[1:43:04] do not match the the pattern of the
[1:43:07] word.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Okay? It doesn't. You can't say you are
[1:43:13] Holy Ghost filled and he sits on your
[1:43:15] throne room and you live any kind of
[1:43:17] life you want to.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; It doesn't compute.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; It's not there. Now they hated him for
[1:43:26] it.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Why? He's saying it's the Holy Spirit.
[1:43:31] All right. And he says, "You say you got
[1:43:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:43:36] sermon, the rapture." I gave you the
[1:43:37] quote there. I said that don't mean
[1:43:39] nothing.
[1:43:41] Because you know why? Because they had
[1:43:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost on their
[1:43:46] body.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; They jumped sh they had it on their
[1:43:49] spirit activating the gifts of the
[1:43:51] spirit.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; But the throne room Christ wasn't
[1:43:55] sitting there.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Their self-will said, "I can do whatever
[1:44:00] I want.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; I can live any kind of life." Why? Look,
[1:44:05] God operates my gift.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Speak in tongues. Watch. I have faith to
[1:44:09] move mountains. And you can have all of
[1:44:11] these things. I have can have the gifts.
[1:44:14] I can have faith that I might move
[1:44:16] mountains. I might give my body to be
[1:44:19] burned. And he says, "And if you have
[1:44:21] not love because God
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; is love."
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "You are sounding brass
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; and tinkling symbols."
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:44:34] So now remember, I take you Bible
[1:44:36] examples. I'm not going to flood you
[1:44:38] with all of those examples, but
[1:44:40] Caiaphas, who was the high priest
[1:44:43] who helped have Jesus crucified,
[1:44:47] prophesied.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Sa uh Balum prophesied.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Judas preached the gospel, laid hands on
[1:44:57] the sick,
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Had all kinds of signs and wonders. And
[1:45:01] yet, when it come to the Holy Ghost,
[1:45:03] baptism showed his colors.
[1:45:06] Yep.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without
[1:45:10] repentance. Now, here's where the word
[1:45:12] of God becomes a sharp two-edged sword.
[1:45:15] It begins now to divide us under
[1:45:20] between the spirit and the soul.
[1:45:24] Theology won't teach you that. Seminary
[1:45:26] won't teach you that. And man's teaching
[1:45:29] will not do that. It must be a
[1:45:31] revelation of the Holy Spirit
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; or you fail to catch it.
[1:45:37] Does not the Bible say try the spirits
[1:45:38] to see whether they be of God?
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Try the spirits.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Rem says, "How do I try the
[1:45:45] spirits?" He said, "It's not you trying
[1:45:47] them.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God that tries the
[1:45:50] spirits."
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; One of the brothers that brought me the
[1:45:55] message, he thought trying of the spirit
[1:45:59] was to actually kick somebody in the
[1:46:01] shin and watch your reaction.
[1:46:06] Come here, Bo.
[1:46:09] Let me try your spirit.
[1:46:14] That ain't trying of spirits. Kick you
[1:46:16] in the shin.
[1:46:20] Chances are you're going to get But
[1:46:23] what? But yeah, you see, saints of God,
[1:46:26] there was too much false teaching
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; and things that were told on how do I
[1:46:32] try the spirits? No. Give it the word
[1:46:34] test.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; It's not you testing it. It's the word.
[1:46:37] That's not what the word says. That's
[1:46:40] not the way the word will be.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; And so now the pattern of the word and
[1:46:44] you say therefore you're false.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Right,
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; brother Brennham there in that meeting.
[1:46:51] I think it's in the sermon the name of
[1:46:53] Jesus. And he said there come tongues
[1:46:56] and interpretation. There's one among us
[1:46:58] that doesn't believe all this stuff.
[1:47:00] remember shaving a haircut, six bits,
[1:47:02] and and a pencil coming up and a tune
[1:47:05] going on and a and a table floating. You
[1:47:08] all remember that? A table floating in
[1:47:10] the air.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; And there's somebody here that doesn't
[1:47:15] believe that this is the spirit of God.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yeah, that's right."
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm him in the name of the
[1:47:26] Roman Catholic Church. Tell me, is this
[1:47:28] the truth?
[1:47:30] table kept floating.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Tell me in the name of father,
[1:47:35] son, holy ghost." And how many of you
[1:47:36] know the devil travels in the name
[1:47:39] father, son, and holy ghost?
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "In the name of father, son,
[1:47:47] holy ghost, tell me, are you saying the
[1:47:50] truth?" Stayed right there. And he said,
[1:47:52] "Now, in the name of Jesus Christ, tell
[1:47:55] me." He said, "That table hit the
[1:47:56] ground. The legs got knocked off it. I'm
[1:47:59] a false spirit
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; trying to deceive.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; What is it? All kinds of
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; supernatural floating lights and
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; all kinds of stuff.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants some kind of
[1:48:14] vindication.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; You ever had a picture taken of yourself
[1:48:18] and something weird about it?
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I had one person. I'm sitting
[1:48:23] in my my lazy boy chair
[1:48:26] and somebody took a picture and I I'm
[1:48:29] just sitting there just like this. Got
[1:48:30] my feet up
[1:48:32] and there's an aura of light all around
[1:48:35] it.
[1:48:40] Of course, I sent it around the world to
[1:48:41] everybody I knew.
[1:48:44] This is the vindication.
[1:48:46] Oh, stop.
[1:48:49] all this kind of stuff or some kind of
[1:48:50] light or strange thing come up and
[1:48:52] everything. See, that was God. No,
[1:48:55] sometimes sometimes I'm a photographer
[1:49:00] and I question a lot of these pictures
[1:49:02] that quote are supernatural lights. What
[1:49:05] it is? You have a lens, huh,
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amber? you know, you take photos and if
[1:49:10] there's a light over here and you got a
[1:49:12] star filter on your lens and all of a
[1:49:15] sudden little baby man, he's got he's
[1:49:18] got rays of light.
[1:49:21] This is a proper child. I've never seen
[1:49:23] this. It's a star filter.
[1:49:27] Or it used to be I used to uh develop
[1:49:30] film. You had the dark room. You go in
[1:49:33] there, you take a a negative, you take
[1:49:35] put it down and and and and you burn the
[1:49:39] picture for so long, then you put it in
[1:49:41] any in a liquid and you this and you put
[1:49:44] it into another one and pretty soon the
[1:49:46] picture appears. Well, there's times
[1:49:48] when if you don't mix your chemicals
[1:49:52] properly, because there used to be some
[1:49:54] crystals that we put in there and you
[1:49:56] had to mix them properly and if you
[1:49:59] didn't, some of the crystals slid up on
[1:50:02] top of the paper and you got a little
[1:50:04] star or some kind of thing and Oh,
[1:50:09] see that's a vindication.
[1:50:12] No, that's a crystal.
[1:50:19] So much of the time people are looking
[1:50:20] for some kind of
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; vindication.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not here, you know. Hey, hey,
[1:50:25] listen. The vindication is is my life
[1:50:28] matching what the word of God says. If
[1:50:30] so, that's the vindication.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Such a perfect What a perfect song.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Of the word being made manifest.
[1:50:44] So, let's go back to this one.
[1:50:51] Yeah, the nice new one here that
[1:50:54] somebody made for me. I won't tell you
[1:50:58] who it was,
[1:51:01] but she
[1:51:05] Yeah, it's perfect.
[1:51:11] She told me, "Don't tell anybody." I
[1:51:14] didn't.
[1:51:17] All right.
[1:51:20] Now,
[1:51:22] uh,
[1:51:25] I want you to understand
[1:51:28] that there are five gates to your spirit
[1:51:31] realm.
[1:51:33] Because now right here this is drawn as
[1:51:38] a womb. And brother Brennham said the
[1:51:41] womb to your spirit is your mind.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; And understand that everything you go
[1:51:47] through is going to come through the
[1:51:50] concept of what you receive into your
[1:51:53] mind. And if you sit there and you allow
[1:51:56] those seeds, whether they're good or
[1:51:58] bad, it will reproduce itself.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's a womb. Right?
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; A woman, if she receives a bad man's
[1:52:06] seed, she's going to bring forth that
[1:52:09] bad man's seed. She's going to reproduce
[1:52:11] what was
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; placed in her.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; She's an incubator of the word.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; So now we have here the womb of the
[1:52:23] spirit, which is the mind. That's why
[1:52:25] everything you go through is a mind
[1:52:28] battle.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yep.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:52:33] And so you have here you have uh
[1:52:37] imaginations, conscience, memory,
[1:52:40] reason, and affections.
[1:52:43] And the devil will use those and so will
[1:52:45] God.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Okay? But you can be fooled by certain
[1:52:50] things. Now, I'm just going to go
[1:52:52] through some things here and I'll show
[1:52:54] you. Brother Bren says in one of the
[1:52:56] most illuminating sermons, the greatest
[1:52:59] battle ever fought.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; He said it started in heaven, was cast
[1:53:05] down the earth, and it became human
[1:53:07] battles. He said God chose the heart,
[1:53:10] but Satan chose the mind. So now watch
[1:53:13] this. The battle raged when Eve opened
[1:53:16] up her mind to listen to her reasoning.
[1:53:20] Yeah,
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; that's the flu that had it come in.
[1:53:25] That's the channel it run down. Her
[1:53:28] reasoning.
[1:53:32] See, in her soul, she reasoned. Her eyes
[1:53:35] was sight. She saw the serpent. He was
[1:53:38] beautiful, handsome, far better than her
[1:53:40] own husband. He was most subtle of all
[1:53:42] the beasts of the field. He's probably a
[1:53:44] fairer man than her husband. He looked
[1:53:47] like a great masculine beast standing
[1:53:49] there. how great he was. He is trying to
[1:53:52] tell her what a great thing it was. And
[1:53:54] the first thing she did, she opened her
[1:53:56] mind. And when she did, human reasoning
[1:53:59] caught it.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brim said it took him years
[1:54:04] of talking and meeting with her alone
[1:54:07] and sewing seed.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, Eve, you look so beautiful. I'm I
[1:54:11] you know, hey, come just sit down. Let
[1:54:13] me chat with you. I know. Don't get
[1:54:16] Adam. Don't bring Adam here. No, no, no,
[1:54:18] no. Even though Jesus said, "Go get your
[1:54:20] husband and bring him here
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; because there is a See,
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; he could have never got to her
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; had Adam been standing here."
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; So, he caught her at a time when she was
[1:54:33] alone.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; And then he used the channel of
[1:54:36] reasoning.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be like God? Huh?
[1:54:39] Don't you want the no good from evil?
[1:54:41] Yeah. Yeah. and already deceiving her by
[1:54:45] saying, "Uh, you'll not die."
[1:54:49] Because she quoted the word, "But of
[1:54:50] every tree of the field, of everything."
[1:54:53] Huh, James, you did a great job. Of one
[1:54:55] thing, don't eat
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; just one thing. Everything else you can
[1:55:00] eat.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Everything. Avocado, citrus,
[1:55:04] pomegranate, anything. Eat it.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; But one,
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; but why?
[1:55:12] Because the day you eat thereof
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; is the day you die.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? Just one thing.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; So she opened human reasoning. Where was
[1:55:25] their greatest battle fought?
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; In her mind,
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; where's the greatest battle that we
[1:55:30] fight?
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Now understand that when Jesus spoke to
[1:55:34] the Pharisees, he's discerning their
[1:55:36] thoughts.
[1:55:39] In Matthew 2:es 6-9, and there were
[1:55:43] certain of the scribes sitting there and
[1:55:44] reasoning in their hearts,
[1:55:47] why does this man thus speak
[1:55:50] blasphemies?
[1:55:53] Who can forgive sins but God only? And
[1:55:56] immediately when Jesus perceived in his
[1:55:59] spirit
[1:56:00] that they reasoned them within
[1:56:03] themselves, he said unto them, Why
[1:56:05] reason ye these things in your heart?
[1:56:08] Whether it is easier to say to the sick
[1:56:10] of the Pauly, "Thy sins be forgiven
[1:56:12] thee." Or to say, "Arise and take up thy
[1:56:14] bed and walk."
[1:56:17] Which is easier. Your sins are forgiven.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Rather than say, "Take up your bed and
[1:56:23] walk."
[1:56:25] So they are all of they're they're upset
[1:56:27] with him.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand that many
[1:56:32] people will appeal to your channel of
[1:56:35] reasoning. The prophet said this, but it
[1:56:39] never happened.
[1:56:41] The prophet said this, where was it
[1:56:43] fulfilled? Now understand, God is his
[1:56:46] own interpreter, and he brings the word
[1:56:49] to pass as he chooses.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; And you can miss it. You can miss it as
[1:56:55] far as east from west of not seeing it.
[1:56:57] Why? Because of preconceived
[1:57:00] uh
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; terminology.
[1:57:03] Well, I'll tell you what. I think
[1:57:06] there's going to be a tent. Oh, yeah.
[1:57:09] Brother Rem said it was a vision.
[1:57:12] He said it looked like a cathedral.
[1:57:15] Why don't we call it cathedral vision?
[1:57:21] Well, he said a tent. He said, you know,
[1:57:23] according to the vision, it looked like
[1:57:25] a tent.
[1:57:28] That's why people say, well, he's got to
[1:57:30] come back. He's got to have a return
[1:57:31] ministry. got to have a tent. And when
[1:57:33] he does, he's going to preach us from
[1:57:36] illegitimate to legitimate and all of
[1:57:38] this stuff. And he's going to fly into
[1:57:39] Mosley's airplane. He's going to go to
[1:57:41] the White House, give him thus sayith
[1:57:42] the Lord. He's going to shoot to brown
[1:57:44] bear. On and on and on. Why? Because
[1:57:46] what it is when brother Brennan went off
[1:57:48] of the scene, there were things that
[1:57:51] people said his ministry is not
[1:57:54] finished. He he he didn't fulfill it.
[1:57:59] Well, he's got to come back.
[1:58:01] He even why the seventh seal hasn't even
[1:58:04] been revealed. He said, you know, we
[1:58:05] come right up to the seventh seal and
[1:58:07] it's a mystery. And yet, why do we have
[1:58:10] a book called the revelation of the
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; six seals?
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Seven. What is the seven? He the seven
[1:58:19] seals of mystery. You know what he said?
[1:58:21] Revelations 10 1:7. Seventh seal.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; He said that's his coming.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Shh. Don't tell nobody. Because if they
[1:58:31] don't get it, you can't teach it to
[1:58:33] them.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; But when God opens your eyes and you
[1:58:36] realize this whole message is about the
[1:58:38] coming of the Lord, it's getting a bride
[1:58:41] ready for his coming. And thank you,
[1:58:43] Lord. I'm a product of the seventh seal.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; It's been open. The mysteryy's been
[1:58:48] revealed.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is it? Who is it? It's
[1:58:52] Christ. He is those seals.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; He broke every one of them.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; But only to the elect.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:00] That's right.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; So false prophets even among this
[1:59:04] message
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; have got to come and give carnal
[1:59:08] reasoning
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; because it's a lack of understanding by
[1:59:12] revelation. So now they put their
[1:59:14] reasoning to it.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; God didn't ask you to reason it.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; He don't want your interpretation.
[1:59:23] Proverbs 3 and5, "Trust in the Lord with
[1:59:25] all thine high heart, and lean not unto
[1:59:28] thine own understanding."
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't have to figure it out.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Say what he said. Say what the vision
[1:59:35] said.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; I don't care how God wants to bring it
[1:59:41] to pass.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; He's the interpreter.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; He'll bring it to pass. Amen.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will bring it to pass.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Visions are not to be interpreted.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:02] When you are void of spiritual
[2:00:04] revelation, you will lean to your own
[2:00:06] carnal reasoning.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you can't figure it out.
[2:00:10] Well, he said thus and thus'll happen.
[2:00:11] Didn't happen. I want to ask you, any of
[2:00:14] you see him take a baby shoe and try to
[2:00:16] lace it?
[2:00:21] That's part of the vision.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Any of you see him? He said, "I'll meet
[2:00:26] you in there." Where?
[2:00:29] Did he go there?
[2:00:31] He was above.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; I'll meet you in there. He said, "There
[2:00:34] I was. I'm looking down. People coming
[2:00:37] in, right?"
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; And he says, "But why? Why there? Why
[2:00:41] that little room? Is it not written in
[2:00:43] the scripture?" Always goes back to the
[2:00:45] word.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll meet you in there. I want
[2:00:48] to ask you, where was Elijah's prayer
[2:00:50] closet?
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Wilderness.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Wilderness.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; He goes to a cave.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; He goes to the wilderness. He goes to
[2:00:57] the Sabino Canyon. Huh? Sunset Mountain.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; It shall be light about the evening
[2:01:05] time.
[2:01:07] The path to glory you shall surely find.
[2:01:10] What do you think this attraction was?
[2:01:14] What is this attraction in the Coronado
[2:01:16] Forest of Arizona? The people are coming
[2:01:19] from all over. Billy Silva goes over
[2:01:22] there and he takes people. Where are
[2:01:24] you, Billy?
[2:01:27] And you brought me a three cornered
[2:01:29] pyramid.
[2:01:31] You know how many people have gone over
[2:01:33] there? Hey, I tell you what, they're
[2:01:34] hard to find now.
[2:01:36] He said, "There he was there." And he
[2:01:39] said something said throw up a rock.
[2:01:43] Why? It takes a an action to create a
[2:01:46] reaction.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; He said something's going to happen,
[2:01:49] brethren. You better.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; You better get under shelter.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Throws up a rock.
[2:01:58] Whirlwind.
[2:02:01] A blast shook it. He said, "Cut the tops
[2:02:05] of the mosquite trees off. blasted the
[2:02:08] side of the mountain. Rocks went
[2:02:10] scattering. Thus sayaith the Lord,
[2:02:12] judgment
[2:02:14] striking the west coast.
[2:02:17] Do you see?
[2:02:19] What is this attraction
[2:02:22] that happened in the Coronado Forest?
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; What is it that's caused an attraction
[2:02:27] to you? Was it just the first pull, the
[2:02:31] healings? Was it the discernments? Oh,
[2:02:34] thou art a man come from God. No man
[2:02:37] could do these things except God be with
[2:02:39] him
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; until he begins to reveal through the
[2:02:44] third pole. He said, "This is the
[2:02:46] vindication of your ministry." Wait a
[2:02:48] second. Wait a second. You mean the
[2:02:50] sword?
[2:02:52] And that event means a furtherance of
[2:02:55] his gospel. I thought it was the end. He
[2:02:58] thought it was the end. I'm not even
[2:02:59] coming home.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; He thought he's going to die.
[2:03:03] go back and listen to the tapes.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; If you were there in his family, you
[2:03:09] would have seen he's a nervous wreck.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; All shook up. Can't sleep. Can't eat.
[2:03:18] I'm not coming home.
[2:03:24] Billy, take care of the kids. You'll
[2:03:28] find my Bible up there somewhere.
[2:03:32] He said, "No man can live through a
[2:03:33] blast like that."
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; So now he's up there thinking, "It's the
[2:03:37] end of his ministry." He's praying, "Oh
[2:03:39] God," he's on his knees, got his hands
[2:03:42] up. "Oh God, what does this vision mean?
[2:03:46] What does it mean?" He said something
[2:03:48] struck his hand.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "There wasn't nobody around."
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "I had to pinch myself. Is this
[2:03:58] real?" And he said the handle of the
[2:04:02] sword fit my hand.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; He said it must be a king's sword.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; He said it's not a king.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; It's the king.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Now the word of God is placed in his
[2:04:22] hand in a third pole. The revealing of
[2:04:25] the word.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; The discerning of spirit. The dividing
[2:04:29] of sunder.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Do you see what the word of
[2:04:34] God sharp two-edged sword to the
[2:04:36] dividing and sunder between spirit and
[2:04:39] soul.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Man is always trying to figure things
[2:04:43] out. So now go back to that drawing of
[2:04:46] the the three circles there because I
[2:04:48] want to go over things. Okay. Now I've
[2:04:52] always told because brother Biscll did a
[2:04:54] relational association
[2:04:57] uh he took the first letter memory
[2:04:59] imagination conscience affection and
[2:05:01] reasoning my car everybody wants my car
[2:05:04] I'll never forget that so probably you
[2:05:07] will think okay memory so now uh you
[2:05:11] have here memory imaginations conscience
[2:05:14] affection and reason okay so now memory
[2:05:20] is Good.
[2:05:22] You have to have something in your
[2:05:23] memory for it to be brought back to your
[2:05:25] remembrance. That's why you come to
[2:05:27] church and sometimes it don't compute.
[2:05:29] That's okay. It's being logged because
[2:05:32] after my departing this will come to
[2:05:36] you. Uh why do you not understand these
[2:05:38] things? Why don't you understand?
[2:05:41] He said the day is coming.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; It's a timereleased revelation. It comes
[2:05:48] to you in season.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; That's why there were very few people
[2:05:53] that understood the prophet's ministry
[2:05:55] when he was here.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Even brother Billy Paul said, "I did not
[2:06:00] know who daddy was, and I didn't see the
[2:06:02] scriptural reference of his gift until
[2:06:05] after he died." To me, he was daddy.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "I used him." Go up and go
[2:06:14] hunting. Go uh uh pig hunting. And guess
[2:06:16] what? stand on the edge. He he got into
[2:06:18] a place where he crawled down onto a
[2:06:20] ledge and there's about a four or five
[2:06:21] foot uh little ravine and it's 30 40
[2:06:25] foot drop and
[2:06:29] no no
[2:06:32] dad.
[2:06:34] Dad, where are you? I'm over here.
[2:06:37] Billy, what's the matter? I want to
[2:06:40] jump, but I don't know. You have to have
[2:06:42] the say the Lord. I'm not going to jump.
[2:06:46] No, Billy. No, you don't. Go ahead. I'm
[2:06:48] telling you, you'll make it. No, Daddy.
[2:06:52] Tell me by vision.
[2:06:55] Okay, I see you make it.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying?
[2:07:05] Was too close. You were You were too
[2:07:07] close to the forest to see the truth.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:13] So there were no evening light
[2:07:15] fellowships and end time message
[2:07:17] tabernacle. No, there was a few people
[2:07:20] catching. Wow, this is a great ministry.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Okay, they saw man this was amazing.
[2:07:28] So they saw the ministry.
[2:07:34] So memory, it is a process of
[2:07:37] remembering something.
[2:07:40] Now I I I must admit that the older I
[2:07:43] get,
[2:07:44] the less of it I have.
[2:07:48] Anybody know what I'm talking about? My
[2:07:50] wife and I are talking to one another.
[2:07:52] Sandy. Sandy. She goes, "Yes, honey."
[2:07:54] And I go, "I just forgot.
[2:07:57] I'm I I'm I'm ready to tell her. It's
[2:07:59] there. It's on." Sandy, yes, honey. I
[2:08:01] forgot. Oh, you got to be kidding me.
[2:08:03] She did it to me the other day. I said,
[2:08:05] "Uh-huh. Uh-huh. See, see, you didn't
[2:08:08] you you." So, memory, it can be used
[2:08:11] good or bad. Okay. So, memory, the enemy
[2:08:15] can come and bring to your memory past
[2:08:19] failures and path past problems.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have a hard time
[2:08:24] getting over it. And I remember, hey,
[2:08:26] man, don't you trust no preacher. Don't
[2:08:28] you trust nobody.
[2:08:31] Excuse me. Don't even let anybody become
[2:08:34] your friend
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; because you were betrayed. You remember
[2:08:39] you want that to happen again? Go ahead.
[2:08:42] And he anoints your memory and say,
[2:08:43] "Okay, man. I'm going Hey, hey, I don't
[2:08:46] even know if I had to go to church. All
[2:08:47] those people and hey,
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; you you remember." So, Satan will use
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; memory against you if you're not
[2:09:03] careful.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; You know, girls are real good about
[2:09:06] memory
[2:09:08] on certain things. You know, they had a
[2:09:10] boyfriend, they had a certain song they
[2:09:12] play. That's a R song.
[2:09:15] So, you're dating a girl and you know,
[2:09:17] you got the old radio on this before my
[2:09:19] conversion. And a certain comes on and
[2:09:21] the girl goes, "Oh,
[2:09:23] Johnny."
[2:09:25] What?
[2:09:27] This ain't Johnny, it's Ronnie.
[2:09:32] You understand what I'm talking about?
[2:09:33] But she was thinking about her her
[2:09:35] memory. Okay.
[2:09:38] Hey, I'm the papa bear in this fairy
[2:09:40] tale.
[2:09:44] Okay.
[2:09:48] So, if you're not careful, sometimes the
[2:09:50] only way you get really anointed is
[2:09:52] stroll down memory lane.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, you remember when
[2:09:57] Do you remember the meetings and what it
[2:09:59] was like and the prophet came and oh it
[2:10:02] was so good and he came out?
[2:10:05] I tell you even the way he walked under
[2:10:07] the bulb but and it was he just rireed
[2:10:10] with humility as
[2:10:13] those were the good old days. And so
[2:10:16] sometimes the only time people get
[2:10:17] anointed is they walk down memory lane.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Well Jesus Christ is the same.
[2:10:29] Not just yesterday.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; If you're not careful, you'll be one of
[2:10:32] the Beatles.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Yesterday,
[2:10:35] all my troubles seem so far away.
[2:10:45] Now they've come here to stay.
[2:10:49] Oh, I believe. Oh, I don't believe in
[2:10:52] yesterday. I believe in today
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; and I believe in forever
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; because if you're not careful, the enemy
[2:10:59] will use memory against you. Okay?
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 15:es 1-2. Moreover,
[2:11:06] brethren, I declare unto you the gospel
[2:11:08] which I preached unto you, which also
[2:11:10] you received, and wherein you stand, by
[2:11:14] which also you are saved, if you keep in
[2:11:17] memory
[2:11:19] what I preached unto you, unless you
[2:11:22] have believed in vain.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that when I
[2:11:30] preach this message, I'm putting you
[2:11:33] back in remembrance. of what he said.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; I don't have a message.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; I'm just a mail carrier.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you of what he said. That's
[2:11:45] why I give you quotes.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; I don't just come up here and paraphrase
[2:11:48] it and well, the prophet of God said and
[2:11:51] this and that and so next thing you
[2:11:53] know, I'm paraphrasing what he said. No,
[2:11:55] say what he said.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:12:00] So the seed of all your emotions and
[2:12:03] feelings and sensations are in your
[2:12:06] mind.
[2:12:09] The vast majority of your battles you
[2:12:12] will face in your Christian walk will
[2:12:15] have to do with what goes through the
[2:12:18] battle in your mind.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Any of you ever have mind battles?
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:12:28] Somebody say something to you or
[2:12:31] didn't say it the way you liked it or
[2:12:35] bypassed shaking your hand after church.
[2:12:38] She don't like me. I know she don't. She
[2:12:40] She didn't shake my hand. Walked right
[2:12:42] past me. I waved to them. They wouldn't
[2:12:45] didn't wave back. You ever had somebody
[2:12:48] wave to you and you you waved back and
[2:12:50] kind of find out they're waving to the
[2:12:51] person behind you?
[2:12:57] But your your imagination, huh?
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; You know, uh, they didn't shake my hand.
[2:13:08] So now your imagination, any of you have
[2:13:10] your imagination run wild?
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Especially at night.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Any of you ever get a sickness? It's
[2:13:18] much worse at night.
[2:13:21] I'm going to die.
[2:13:26] Sunrise, I feel a whole lot better.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; we are not children of darkness, but of
[2:13:35] day.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; But your imagination, if you're if it
[2:13:38] goes unchecked,
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; my wife bought one of those medical
[2:13:42] self-help books at Costco.
[2:13:46] If you have a cold,
[2:13:49] you turn back, it say, read page 76. Do
[2:13:52] you have a runny nose? Yes.
[2:13:56] Do you have a fever? If you do, go to
[2:13:58] page 92. I go to page 92 and check,
[2:14:02] check, check. Pretty soon,
[2:14:06] I got every symptom.
[2:14:10] It's horrible. My wife took it away from
[2:14:12] me.
[2:14:14] She says, "Honey, quit reading that.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible says by your stripes he is you
[2:14:19] are healed."
[2:14:21] No, no. It said right here.
[2:14:24] I got every one of those symptoms.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Brim said, "Yes, you may
[2:14:28] have the symptom, but if you believe the
[2:14:30] symptom rather than the word, you'll
[2:14:32] stay there on your cot and die.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord."
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, we're all human.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; We all have battles of our mind.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Have a lump on the back of your neck. Oh
[2:14:45] my.
[2:14:48] I I I was at Norway. This is funny. I
[2:14:50] was in Norway and and see this mole on
[2:14:54] my face. See it here? Well, I used to
[2:14:55] have another one. There was two of them.
[2:14:57] Okay. And so anyway, we're in Norway.
[2:15:00] I've got my kids and I've been preaching
[2:15:02] and everything. And all a sudden, man,
[2:15:04] the next morning the Wow, I get a Mount
[2:15:07] Vuvius
[2:15:09] thing on. It's red. It's sore. Oh, look
[2:15:13] at that mole, honey. And she went to
[2:15:16] Don't touch it. Don't.
[2:15:19] So, we didn't have no insurance or
[2:15:21] nothing. So,
[2:15:23] this sister Armstrong,
[2:15:26] uh, Sister Nita Armstrong,
[2:15:30] she took me to the doctor and, uh, you
[2:15:34] know, she said, "I'll pay for it." Okay.
[2:15:35] Okay. I go in there and the doctor said,
[2:15:38] "Uh, come here. Let me look at that."
[2:15:40] So, he's got one of these round things
[2:15:42] on his head where the light shines in.
[2:15:45] So, you know, there's a light coming
[2:15:47] down here like this. And he goes, "So,
[2:15:50] how long have you had this?" Well, a day
[2:15:52] or so. Does it hurt much?
[2:15:56] And he presses all
[2:15:59] it was a huge pimple
[2:16:01] and it squirted went all over his
[2:16:09] Sorry, doc.
[2:16:12] Do you know that demon left me?
[2:16:16] Do you know that I had that? That thing
[2:16:18] bothered me so bad. I thought I'm dying,
[2:16:21] man. This is cancerous. And look, it's
[2:16:24] got this big and it come off so quickly.
[2:16:26] And
[2:16:28] after that, I started laughing. I said,
[2:16:30] "Yeah, yeah, the dog is wiping his
[2:16:32] face."
[2:16:34] How much of the time, huh, do we allow
[2:16:38] things in our mind? Greatest battle ever
[2:16:40] fought.
[2:16:46] The Apostle Paul and James did an
[2:16:48] excellent job about this, but let me
[2:16:50] read the scripture. Oh, I'm I'm I'm
[2:16:52] overtime.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; That's all right. That's right.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Go on."
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Go on.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:17:00] Romans 7. Romans 7. For we know that the
[2:17:04] law is spiritual, but I am carnal
[2:17:08] and sold under sin. For that which I do
[2:17:13] I allow not. For what I would that I do
[2:17:18] not but what I hate.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; I do that that I do.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Any of you been there?
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; You're talking my language here, buddy.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Happened many times. That which I want
[2:17:32] to do, I don't do.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; That which I didn't do, that I do.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Now, now watch him show this.
[2:17:39] Now then, it's no more I that do it, but
[2:17:42] sin that dwelleth in me.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; For I know that in me, and there here, I
[2:17:47] didn't put this quotation in here. I
[2:17:49] didn't put the parenthesy. That is in my
[2:17:52] flesh. Somebody say flesh.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; That in my flesh is no good thing.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. Give it to Holy Ghost. It's
[2:18:00] still no good thing.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; This flesh is going to bother you until
[2:18:06] we drop it.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:10] That's why your flesh is a byproduct of
[2:18:12] sin.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Satan has an affinity to it. Puts
[2:18:16] thoughts into your mind.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; That's why you have such a mind battle.
[2:18:20] But in the moment, in a twinkling of an
[2:18:23] eye, we shall all be
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Changed.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; Immortality.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Huh? We're going to go from mortal to
[2:18:35] immortality.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Thank God. from carnal to spiritual.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Because God will not allow anything
[2:18:44] sinful to come into his presence.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Over there, that body that you will have
[2:18:55] will never have it'll never have an
[2:18:58] aching backraise,
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; a bad knee,
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; won't have false teeth. You won't wear
[2:19:04] glasses.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; There'll be no hospitals, no nurses.
[2:19:09] There'll be no ambulance. There'll no be
[2:19:11] no police.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Wow. Think think of that community.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Talk about something
[2:19:22] so wonderful.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; It's beyond my comprehension.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; But I do know this. The older I get, the
[2:19:30] more I want that
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; I do. When's a young man? Hey, death was
[2:19:35] so far and forboating and
[2:19:40] but the older I get,
[2:19:43] I think that's not so bad.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; If this body be dissolved, I have
[2:19:49] another one waiting.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; So sometimes I'm saying not that I want
[2:19:54] to be unclothed, but I want to be
[2:19:56] clothed upon.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. Okay.
[2:20:04] Now
[2:20:05] verse 20. Now if I do that, I would not.
[2:20:08] It's no more I that do it, but sin that
[2:20:09] dwelleth in me. I find I find then a
[2:20:12] law.
[2:20:14] James, here's your sermon. I find a law.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; When I would do good, evil is present
[2:20:20] with me. For I delight in the law of God
[2:20:24] after the inward man. Do you see the
[2:20:26] inward man? Not the outward man. That
[2:20:28] guy is a He's a hypocrite. He's a
[2:20:31] jokester.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:20:35] He's a Jacob
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; before conversion.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; But after conversion, he becomes an
[2:20:41] Israel.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Wow. I delight in the law of God after
[2:20:45] the inward man. I see another law in my
[2:20:47] members, warning against the law of my
[2:20:50] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[2:20:54] the law of sin which is in my members.
[2:20:56] Oh wretched
[2:20:58] man that I am, who shall deliver me from
[2:21:00] the body of this dead? Any of you ever
[2:21:04] gotten mad at yourself?
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; You'd um do you?
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Why? If you had any brains,
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; oh wretched
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; man that I am, who
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; shall deliver me from this body of
[2:21:26] death? Now watch what he says. I thank
[2:21:29] God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So
[2:21:32] then with the mind I myself serve the
[2:21:34] law of God, but with the flesh I serve
[2:21:36] the law of sin.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; It's there with me.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Thank God in a moment and twinkling your
[2:21:42] eye, there's going to be a change.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; You must guard your mind so of what you
[2:21:51] allow to be put into it.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; If you sow fleshly things into your
[2:21:55] mind, you shall reap corruption.
[2:21:58] It's called the law of sowing and
[2:22:00] reaping. Be not deceived. God is not
[2:22:02] mocked.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Put for you sow to the flesh, you shall
[2:22:07] of the flesh what?
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; You're going to reap corruption.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Why am I having all of these things?
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Huh? Why am I going through what I'm
[2:22:16] going through? I'm having such a hard
[2:22:17] time, Brother Ron. I don't even want to
[2:22:18] come to church anymore. I can't read my
[2:22:20] Bible.
[2:22:22] There's no anointing. Are you praying
[2:22:24] and reading? No.
[2:22:28] Yeah. Well,
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; be not deceived. God's not mocked.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; So, you got to sew to the spirit.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Sewing to the spirit is reading your
[2:22:40] Bible and praying every day.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; Because seven days without prayer makes
[2:22:47] one week.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; We e a K.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know the more you pray, the more
[2:22:54] you want to pray?
[2:22:57] Do you know the less you pray, the less
[2:22:59] you want to pray?
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; The mind is the womb of the spirit.
[2:23:12] Brother Brandham said in the spoken word
[2:23:14] is the original seed. He says the
[2:23:17] gateway to the soul. You remember now
[2:23:20] there is a woman of the physical.
[2:23:22] There's a woman of the spirit. Did you
[2:23:24] believe that there's a spiritual womb
[2:23:26] and a physical womb? And the mind is the
[2:23:28] womb to the spirit. So whatever you
[2:23:30] allow into your mind,
[2:23:33] if it's uncontrolled,
[2:23:36] if it's wrong seed, it will bring forth
[2:23:39] and conceive in your life.
[2:23:42] And a doubleminded man is what?
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Unstable. And
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; all
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; not just part. all. Should I go to
[2:23:54] church? I don't know. Should I have
[2:23:57] fellowship? I don't know. I'm unstable.
[2:24:01] Nothing like an unstable person. How
[2:24:04] would you like to be married to a wife
[2:24:07] and she gets up? I don't know if we
[2:24:09] should be married.
[2:24:16] Yeah, but I thought you said yes. Yeah,
[2:24:18] but you caught me at a wrong time, man.
[2:24:25] What? What? What kind of relationship
[2:24:26] would that be? I don't know. You talk to
[2:24:29] your husband, you say, "I don't know."
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be a horrible way to live?
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible says you take it for better,
[2:24:41] for worse. And sometimes it's for worse.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Honestly,
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; that's why you better check out who
[2:24:48] you're thinking on marrying. You young
[2:24:50] people. Huh?
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You dads, I hope you chase
[2:24:55] away that guy.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Y
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; if he's a shyer, you know, your daughter
[2:25:01] comes to you. Dad, what do you Don't you
[2:25:03] even think of it.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you should come to your pastor
[2:25:10] and pastor, you know, even daddy thinks
[2:25:13] the guy No.
[2:25:16] What? You want me to be an old maid the
[2:25:18] rest of my life? Everybody else is
[2:25:21] married by their 16.
[2:25:26] Oh, stop. I would rather I would rather
[2:25:31] you stay unmarried. The pro Hey, listen.
[2:25:33] The Apostle Paul said, "Listen,
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; it's better for you to marry than to
[2:25:37] burn."
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; So, if you're burning, you better get
[2:25:41] married.
[2:25:43] Okay?
[2:25:44] But the Apostle Paul said, "Now, I would
[2:25:46] rather that you remain as I
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Unmarried, single.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; Because a single person thinks on the
[2:25:54] things of the Lord, how that they might
[2:25:55] serve God, but a married person thinks
[2:25:57] on how they might serve their husband or
[2:25:59] whatever. Huh?
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you what, you take a
[2:26:01] spiritual nose dive right after you get
[2:26:03] married.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; Right? Because when you were single guy,
[2:26:07] hey, you don't have to, you know, think
[2:26:10] about anything. You just do what you
[2:26:12] want. You can have a Bible study. You
[2:26:13] can do you can pray and read and
[2:26:16] everything. But now you get married, you
[2:26:17] think on how it might please your
[2:26:19] husband. But the Apostle Paul said, if
[2:26:22] you get married,
[2:26:24] he said, I will tell you, you're going
[2:26:26] to have
[2:26:28] trouble in the flesh.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Right. Because she don't think like you.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. She comes from a different
[2:26:37] background.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; She's got pink glasses. You got blue.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; You see things differently.
[2:26:44] Now, that is a part of getting married.
[2:26:48] And what's an amazing thing is my wife
[2:26:50] and I now 52 years, we start thinking
[2:26:54] alike.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; I could tell you some things that
[2:27:04] because the closer we are and the older
[2:27:06] we are together, we've become one.
[2:27:10] That's right.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:27:18] the mind is the womb of the spirit. I'm
[2:27:20] going to go on. Spoken word is the
[2:27:22] original seed. Paragraph 184. And when
[2:27:24] the bride of Jesus Christ lets man-made
[2:27:27] creeds and dogmas take the place of the
[2:27:29] word of God, she's committing adultery.
[2:27:34] When the bride of Christ, that's creeds,
[2:27:37] dogmas, take place of the word, she's
[2:27:40] committed adultery. Brother Bram said,
[2:27:41] how does a church, a man, a people, a
[2:27:44] nation commit spiritual adultery on
[2:27:47] Christ? He said when you listen direct
[2:27:51] quote when you by the intercourse of
[2:27:53] your mind
[2:27:56] he says knowing better by the word of
[2:27:58] God add to or taking away from the word
[2:28:00] of God you're absolutely committing
[2:28:03] spiritual adultery on Christ the word.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Wow. That's why he brother Brennham said
[2:28:10] it's blasphemous names. It's seducing
[2:28:14] spirits.
[2:28:16] It's enticing spirits.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; It's sexual spirits. It's unclean.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Religious
[2:28:25] spirits
[2:28:31] have sexual connotations. That's
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let that sink in.
[2:28:40] Paragraph 186. What is it? The mind is
[2:28:43] the woman of the spirit. What? Take in
[2:28:46] or let out. That's how commit adultery.
[2:28:48] It's taking let some Satan devil spirit
[2:28:51] put in them something against the word
[2:28:54] of God. Then she's committed adultery.
[2:28:58] End time seed sign 1962. Musicians, you
[2:29:01] come. I'm starting to close. I am not
[2:29:04] closing, but I'm starting to.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; The womb of her heart, the womb that her
[2:29:10] spirit was in. Your womb of your spirit
[2:29:12] is your mind.
[2:29:14] Your mind is that channel. You've got
[2:29:17] five senses that control the body. You
[2:29:19] got five senses that control the soul.
[2:29:22] It says your soul, body, and spirit.
[2:29:24] Then come the one channel avenue. One
[2:29:27] way into that your own free moral
[2:29:30] agency. That's it. You can receive or
[2:29:32] reject and you do whatever you want to
[2:29:35] do. Now, let's go back to that graph if
[2:29:37] I could. the three circles.
[2:29:43] No, go uh yeah, go to the one with the
[2:29:46] womb on it. Yeah. Now, Brother Bram said
[2:29:52] that Jesus said, "My words are spirit,
[2:29:56] their life, and he that receiveth my
[2:29:59] words receiveth my life." Through the
[2:30:03] hearing of the gate,
[2:30:06] you hear the word of God. Faith cometh
[2:30:08] by hearing. Hearing the word comes
[2:30:11] through into the mind. If you're not
[2:30:13] careful, that's where the seed is
[2:30:15] aborted. I don't believe it.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; So, it's aborted right there. But if you
[2:30:22] say, "No, I believe it." And you let it
[2:30:24] go beyond the mind and come into the
[2:30:29] soul, into the heart of man, thy word,
[2:30:32] oh God, have I hid in my heart.
[2:30:36] And he says, "Then the seed is
[2:30:38] germmitized."
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Came through the hearing
[2:30:41] gate, went through the mind up into the"
[2:30:43] and he said, "But right here is the will
[2:30:47] and that's your will."
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know what that God being an
[2:30:53] almighty God,
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; there's one thing he cannot do.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; He cannot overpower your will.
[2:31:08] No,
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; he waits until your will agrees with
[2:31:13] his.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless,
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; not my will, thine be done.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; You understand it?
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; So each one of you are given free moral
[2:31:26] agency
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; to accept or reject. I believe it, I
[2:31:30] don't believe it. You can be raised
[2:31:33] around this message. You can know its
[2:31:35] precepts, its concept. It can be just a
[2:31:37] religious way to you. It's just long
[2:31:40] dresses, long hair, no makeup, etc. It's
[2:31:43] just a law. It's not a life. It's a law.
[2:31:48] And therefore, you get old enough, you
[2:31:50] get out of the house, you get married,
[2:31:53] you might even go along for a while
[2:31:54] until finally say, "I just don't believe
[2:31:58] it." Do you see what I'm saying? God
[2:32:01] does not take you
[2:32:04] against your will.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Satan does.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; Satan's a rapist.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; God is a gentleman.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Doesn't force himself upon you.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; He waits.
[2:32:19] He waits until you say,
[2:32:22] "Okay, Lord,
[2:32:26] come into my heart. Lord Jesus
[2:32:30] doesn't take you according against your
[2:32:32] will.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; He waits.
[2:32:38] So you have the ability to accept or
[2:32:40] reject.
[2:32:42] The Apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians
[2:32:44] 11, "I am jealous over you with a godly
[2:32:47] jealousy.
[2:32:50] For I have espoused you to one husband,
[2:32:53] that I may present to you as a chasteed
[2:32:55] virgin to Christ.
[2:32:58] But I fear,
[2:33:00] lest by any means,
[2:33:03] as a serpent begal Eve through his
[2:33:05] subtlety,
[2:33:07] so your minds, what is the mind? Womb to
[2:33:10] the spirit. So your minds should be
[2:33:13] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[2:33:16] Christ.
[2:33:18] For if he that cometh preacheth another
[2:33:21] Jesus
[2:33:23] whom you've not preached, whom we have
[2:33:27] not preached, or if you receive another
[2:33:29] spirit
[2:33:31] which you have not received, or another
[2:33:34] gospel
[2:33:36] which you have not accepted,
[2:33:38] you might well bear with him. Wow.
[2:33:42] Eve had all kinds of mind battles,
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; but when she stopped to reason it,
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; that's when he took her.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; He said he took her and seduced her. Do
[2:33:53] you know what beguiled means?
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Woman, what happened to you? The
[2:33:57] serpent. He beguiled me. Do you know
[2:33:59] what beguiled means? He seduced me with
[2:34:01] words.
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; Words. God uses words. Satan uses words.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:11] He beguiled me.
[2:34:13] Wow.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; Another gospel.
[2:34:21] Imagination. The inlet to your spirit.
[2:34:25] Many Christians within this message have
[2:34:28] all kinds of problems with their own
[2:34:30] imagination.
[2:34:32] Yeah, it's true.
[2:34:35] Let your own imagination run wild. Let
[2:34:37] me tell you, it
[2:34:40] it'll cause you to hit the ditch.
[2:34:44] Yeah.
[2:34:45] I I I can't imagine, brother Ron.
[2:34:51] Imagination,
[2:34:53] mind battles,
[2:34:56] affections, memory, imaginations,
[2:34:59] conscience. Let's go to affection for a
[2:35:02] moment. tender attachments,
[2:35:05] something you have a desire for. Some of
[2:35:07] you,
[2:35:10] some of you are having problems walking
[2:35:14] in a sanctified life. Why? Because your
[2:35:16] affections are not set on things above.
[2:35:20] Well, I'd like a bigger I'd like a
[2:35:23] better job. Okay, you get a better job,
[2:35:26] got to work more hours.
[2:35:28] I'd like to have better house. Okay,
[2:35:30] cost more money. Got to work more hours.
[2:35:32] I like a better car. Okay. Got to work
[2:35:36] more for that. Pretty soon till you're
[2:35:38] caught up in the rat race until my
[2:35:40] goodness, I don't have no time for
[2:35:42] nothing.
[2:35:47] I can't hunt, fish, can't do the things
[2:35:49] that I want to do. Don't have time to
[2:35:50] spend with my family. Why? Because the
[2:35:52] Bible says I need to provide for my
[2:35:54] family.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; And you get caught up in the rat race of
[2:35:58] your affections.
[2:36:01] Sometimes your affections get you out of
[2:36:05] God's will and you get out here and then
[2:36:07] you wonder why.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'd like to have just the old simple
[2:36:10] life. Wow, I'm so sick of working.
[2:36:18] Oh, I'd like to have a little shack
[2:36:19] somewhere. It paid off.
[2:36:24] take the kids hunting and fishing and
[2:36:26] have a horse to ride and just Oh,
[2:36:29] wouldn't that be nice? You get all this
[2:36:30] stuff. Well, your affections.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Seek ye first the kingdom
[2:36:37] of God and all these other things."
[2:36:41] &gt;&gt; All these affections you got.
[2:36:45] Colossians 3 1-5. Then if you be risen
[2:36:48] with Christ,
[2:36:50] if you be risen with Christ, are you
[2:36:52] listening? If you be risen with Christ,
[2:36:55] seek those things which are above. Where
[2:36:58] Christ is siteth on the right hand of
[2:37:00] God. Set your affections on things
[2:37:01] above, not on the things of the earth.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; Y
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; for ye are dead, and your life is hid
[2:37:09] with Christ in God, when Christ, who is
[2:37:11] our life, shall appear. Then ye shall
[2:37:14] also appear with him in glory. Mortify
[2:37:17] therefore your members which are upon
[2:37:20] the earth, fornication,
[2:37:22] and uncleanness, and inordinate
[2:37:27] affection.
[2:37:30] Inordinate, improper affection, earthly
[2:37:34] affections.
[2:37:36] Do you know that the cares of life can
[2:37:39] choke the seed
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; to make it unfruitful?
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; Didn't say sin.
[2:37:45] said just the cares of life.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[2:37:50] you allow these affections that you have
[2:37:53] and these desires and stuff that you
[2:37:55] hold dear. Well, I'd like to have We
[2:37:58] were in Vonatu and there was
[2:38:01] a a man sitting next to his boat and he
[2:38:04] went out and caught just a few fish that
[2:38:06] day and he took it to the market.
[2:38:08] Freddy, you only had four or five fish.
[2:38:12] And he went to the market and he sold
[2:38:13] his fish and he sat down next to his
[2:38:16] boat and had a hammock. He got in the
[2:38:18] hammock and he just sway in there back
[2:38:20] and forth. And one of the real rich guys
[2:38:22] came by and said, "Hey, what are you
[2:38:23] doing?" Yeah, I went fishing. He said,
[2:38:25] "Well, you what you need is a bigger
[2:38:27] boat. You get a bigger boat, you get
[2:38:29] more fish, and you can fish all day.
[2:38:31] When you come back, you he says, "And
[2:38:34] then you'll have more time to take time
[2:38:36] off." He said, "No, I have more time
[2:38:38] right now. Why do I want a bigger boat?
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; It's too simple."
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; Huh? I'd like to take all of you to
[2:38:47] Vanuatu. Probably most of you wouldn't
[2:38:49] come back.
[2:38:52] What do you What do you do for work? Me
[2:38:54] grow.
[2:38:56] Yeah. Me grow.
[2:38:59] You plant anything over there. The
[2:39:01] ground is so fertile. Anything grows.
[2:39:03] You don't have to tend to it. Just go
[2:39:05] out there, put the seed in, come back a
[2:39:07] little bit later, take out the taro
[2:39:09] root, guava and mango and the stuff.
[2:39:12] Hey, you know, seems pretty good.
[2:39:18] Oh, it's it's a simple life. Their
[2:39:21] houses.
[2:39:23] They just go out and, you know, a
[2:39:25] hurricane comes home,
[2:39:27] the thatched roof is gone, the wind, the
[2:39:30] walls are blown over. Three days later,
[2:39:33] the hurricane's gone. Guess what? They
[2:39:35] just go build another one in two, three
[2:39:36] days.
[2:39:39] No big deal.
[2:39:41] Life just comes and goes. Understand all
[2:39:45] of these memory, imagination,
[2:39:48] conscience. What about your conscience?
[2:39:55] Any of you ever do something wrong and
[2:39:56] your conscience affects you? I shouldn't
[2:39:59] have done that.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't do Go make that right.
[2:40:03] Amen.
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; And some people say, "I don't have no
[2:40:07] that don't bother my conscience. I can
[2:40:08] cut my hair. I can paint my my nails. I
[2:40:12] can have a manicure. I can wear makeup.
[2:40:14] Don't bother me a bit." Brother Brim
[2:40:15] said, "You got no more conscience than a
[2:40:18] snake's got hips.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; Don't bother me." He says, "I doubt your
[2:40:26] seed
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; or you've had your conscience seared.
[2:40:32] Amen.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; What do you think the world is out here?
[2:40:37] Why they're doing what they're doing?
[2:40:38] They're conscience seared.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; Does it bother them to do those things?
[2:40:42] No. They take pleasure in what they're
[2:40:44] doing.
[2:40:47] [Music]
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; So here I'm going to give you the I'm
[2:40:50] closing now. I am give you two more
[2:40:52] quotes. Both of them from scripture. You
[2:40:56] want to know how to overcome?
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; You want to know the key? Here's here's
[2:41:00] the key to overcoming. your mind
[2:41:03] battles.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 10:es 3-5.
[2:41:08] For though we walk in the flesh, we do
[2:41:10] not war after the flesh.
[2:41:13] For the weapons of our warfare are not
[2:41:16] carnal,
[2:41:17] but mighty through God to the pulling
[2:41:19] down of strongholds,
[2:41:22] casting down imaginations,
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; and everything that exaltth itself
[2:41:27] against the knowledge of God, and
[2:41:30] bringing into captivity every thought,
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; your mind battle, bring every thought
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; to the obedience of Christ. Amen.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; Take it captive.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; That ain't the way God thinks.
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; That's the enemy.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; Taking every thought.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; Philippians 4 6-9. Be careful for
[2:41:55] nothing.
[2:41:58] For in everything by prayer and
[2:42:00] supplication with thanksgiving,
[2:42:02] let your requests be made known unto
[2:42:04] God. And the peace of God which passes
[2:42:08] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[2:42:10] and minds
[2:42:12] your hearts and minds through Christ
[2:42:16] Jesus.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are
[2:42:20] true,
[2:42:22] whatsoever things are honest,
[2:42:25] whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[2:42:27] things are pure,
[2:42:29] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
[2:42:31] things are of good report,
[2:42:34] If there be any virtue, if there be any
[2:42:37] praise,
[2:42:39] think on these
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; things.
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; Your problem is some of you think too
[2:42:49] much.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; I would hate to be some of your brains
[2:42:54] cuz some of you you Well, what if Well,
[2:42:57] what about what do we do when we get
[2:42:59] there? What if the bridge is is blown
[2:43:02] up? What if? What if? What if? What if?
[2:43:04] What if? What if?
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; Are we there yet?
[2:43:10] Hey, hang on.
[2:43:13] Hang on.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; Keep going.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; The word, oh Lord, is a lamp unto my
[2:43:21] feet.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; Any of you ever walked with a com or a
[2:43:24] lantern and you walk through the bush?
[2:43:27] How far do you see?
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; Just a few steps. But Brian, when when
[2:43:33] you take a step with the lamp, what does
[2:43:35] the light do?
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; I just keep going.
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; I'll walk in the light as he is in the
[2:43:43] light. So you just keep walking. Guess
[2:43:45] what? Light goes before you.
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; Keep going.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; Thy word, oh Lord, is a lamp unto my
[2:43:53] feet.
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; Therefore, let me walk
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; by faith. Yes.
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; I don't see the end where I'm going with
[2:44:03] a lantern. It doesn't It's not a
[2:44:05] spotlight out there where you can see
[2:44:08] two miles away and there's your
[2:44:10] destination. No, it's a lamb and you
[2:44:13] follow the the the trail and it's it's
[2:44:16] got valleys and it's got hills and it's
[2:44:18] got trees and it may have a few
[2:44:21] obstacles for you to go around, but you
[2:44:23] know what? doesn't show you the end of
[2:44:25] the road, but if you keep walking,
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; you'll make it.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; How do you make it?
[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; One
[2:44:38] step at a time.
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints of God. I trust
[2:44:43] that when because when you start looking
[2:44:45] at the message, brother Brennham refers
[2:44:48] back to this chart.
[2:44:52] And he says it depends
[2:44:55] on the level that you're living with
[2:44:57] God.
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; Has he come down to the control room?
[2:45:01] Maybe some of you have been round raised
[2:45:03] around this message. Maybe you're you're
[2:45:05] really wondering, is it really for me?
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; Wrestle with the angel.
[2:45:11] That's right.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; Is it for you?
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; Huh? Or is it because mom and dad?
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; I've got some young people that come to
[2:45:19] this church and their parents are not
[2:45:21] believers or have left the message.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; And I think God bless those
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; young people.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; Because you young people, what if your
[2:45:32] mom and dad rejected it? Would you
[2:45:35] reject it?
[2:45:38] What if they said, "Ah, ain't nothing to
[2:45:40] it.
[2:45:42] I've seen a lot of them do it."
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; I just ask you,
[2:45:54] is this message your message?
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; Do you embrace it and say, "God sent
[2:45:58] unto me Elijah."
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not turning back. If none, go with
[2:46:04] me.
[2:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:07] Amen.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way.
[2:46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:17] [Music]
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to turn back.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; Though none go with me,
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; still will I follow.
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; If my friends forsake me,
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; still will I follow.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:33] If the church turns back,
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; still will I
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; Why are you here?
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; Is it because your friends are here?
[2:46:46] Is it because you you you meet people
[2:46:48] and you got Well, it's good. I want you
[2:46:50] to have friends here.
[2:46:52] But what if your friends
[2:46:54] don't come here anymore?
[2:46:59] Well, maybe I'll move because I want to
[2:47:01] go be with my friends. Then you don't
[2:47:03] have a revelation of where your post of
[2:47:06] duty is at.
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; Did God call you here?
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; If God's called you here, there should
[2:47:13] be a revelation. Upon this rock, I'll
[2:47:15] build my church.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; No. This this where I'm called. It's
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; my post of duty.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:28] I had a brother tell me the other day,
[2:47:30] "Brother Ron,
[2:47:32] I'm sorry to tell you,
[2:47:35] you're stuck with me."
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "I ain't going nowhere." I
[2:47:43] said, "God bless you."
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:48] And I say to all of you, you're stuck
[2:47:49] with me.
[2:47:53] &gt;&gt; I ain't going anywhere. I ain't looking
[2:47:55] for a bigger church. I ain't looking for
[2:47:57] more people. I ain't looking for an
[2:47:58] opportunity when opportunity arise and
[2:48:01] maybe somebody else loses a church and
[2:48:04] it's a bigger church. I sorry. See you.
[2:48:06] Adios.
[2:48:08] Sayanara. I'll see you later. No. No.
[2:48:11] I'm here. I'm here for the long haul.
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; God called me to this place. God called
[2:48:17] me to you.
[2:48:19] &gt;&gt; He did.
[2:48:21] While I was in the forest of Germany,
[2:48:25] the Lord spoke to me. Go to Phoenix and
[2:48:27] start a church.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; He told the Apostle Paul, "I've got much
[2:48:32] seed in this city. Go seek whom's
[2:48:35] worthy."
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. God bless you this
[2:48:38] morning.
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Create in me a clean heart.
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; Create in me a clean heart.
[2:48:50] Oh God,
[2:48:55] I renew our spirit.
[2:49:01] [Music]
[2:49:08] We are we
[2:49:11] are
[2:49:14] [Music]
[2:49:16] God
[2:49:20] and renew the right spirit
[2:49:24] within me.
[2:49:28] Cast me not away.
[2:49:30] Oh,
[2:49:32] not away
[2:49:36] from thy presence.
[2:49:43] Take not
[2:49:46] Holy Spirit from me.
[2:49:52] [Music]
[2:49:55] [Applause]
[2:49:55] [Music]

[2:50:01] the joy of my salvation
[2:50:08] as we do arise dearity.
[2:50:14] [Music]
[2:50:20] Sometimes you lose the joy of your
[2:50:22] salvation.
[2:50:24] Go through trials.
[2:50:26] Somebody says something, somebody hurts
[2:50:28] you, you get offended. Who hasn't been
[2:50:31] offended?
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[2:50:33] &gt;&gt; You know what's funny is all of us say,
[2:50:35] "I've been offended. So and so, he said
[2:50:37] this and offended me." What about you?
[2:50:40] Have you offended somebody else?
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; You ever said something sharp and
[2:50:45] uncaring and unkind, inconsiderate to
[2:50:48] somebody else? You might have offended
[2:50:50] somebody else. So much of the time,
[2:50:51] we're so self-righteous, we look at
[2:50:53] everybody else. You offended me. What
[2:50:55] about you?
[2:50:58] A kind word turns away wrath.
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; If somebody slaps you on the cheek, slap
[2:51:04] them harder. What does it say?
[2:51:08] &gt;&gt; Turn the cheek.
[2:51:10] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Eric, that's hard to
[2:51:11] do.
[2:51:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I tell you what, come here, buddy.
[2:51:17] You want the right hand of fellowship?
[2:51:19] I'll give it to you.
[2:51:22] No.
[2:51:24] When you are rebuked,
[2:51:26] when people say all manner of evil
[2:51:29] against you,
[2:51:30] [Music]
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; revile not again. Vengeance is mine,
[2:51:37] sayaeth the Lord. Say good things about
[2:51:39] one another.
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; Love one another.
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; Love covers a multitude of sin.
[2:51:45] &gt;&gt; God, help us keep our tongues off of
[2:51:47] other people and other thing. being
[2:51:48] critical on this one. I find fault with
[2:51:51] this one and that one. Cuz I tell you
[2:51:52] what, when you look through the blood of
[2:51:54] Jesus Christ,
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; I see a blood bought
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; word washed.
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:03] &gt;&gt; Sinless bride Jesus Christ.
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; She is the evidence
[2:52:09] &gt;&gt; of that word. She is the word made
[2:52:12] manifest.
[2:52:14] [Music]
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:18] Amen.
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you saints for coming to church
[2:52:23] this morning, Sunday morning,
[2:52:25] resurrection morning.
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I came to church.
[2:52:30] &gt;&gt; I enjoy going to church. It's my life.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; And not because I'm preaching
[2:52:37] because all my life,
[2:52:40] ever since I got converted, I can't wait
[2:52:43] for those doors to open.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:46] Yes, sir.
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; I can't wait.
[2:52:50] Used to be wife and I just got married.
[2:52:55] I'd be the first one in the parking lot.
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; I I would wait for whoever it was open
[2:53:01] the door.
[2:53:02] &gt;&gt; Be the first one in, sit down, pray,
[2:53:04] read my Bible. Finally, my pastor said,
[2:53:06] "All right, all right. You're here so
[2:53:09] early. Why don't I give you a key, let
[2:53:10] you open up?" Yeah, great.
[2:53:14] That's great. You know what we used to
[2:53:16] do
[2:53:18] before anybody came to church?
[2:53:23] Brother Neil, do you like opening up?
[2:53:25] Isn't it something about coming into the
[2:53:26] building? Nobody's here. You feel his
[2:53:29] presence. You know what we used to do?
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; Nobody's here.
[2:53:33] I used to lay hands on the chairs
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; and I'd say, "Father,
[2:53:38] whoever sits here today,
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; anoint them." Amen.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; Whoever sits on this row,
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; I sit here and I lay my hands on I say,
[2:53:48] "God, God,
[2:53:50] &gt;&gt; whoever comes here today,
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; let the revelation
[2:53:56] be quickened to them."
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; I'd pray over the chair.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; So, whoever sat there,
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:06] &gt;&gt; I've been a fanatic for this message
[2:54:08] ever since I came to it.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:13] Yeah.
[2:54:16] Here's a here's a David Fritz. We knew
[2:54:20] one another before we got married.
[2:54:24] We were both fanatics for this before we
[2:54:26] got married.
[2:54:28] Before anything happened in our lives,
[2:54:30] just a bunch of young kids went to
[2:54:32] Tucson Tabernacle, went there to the
[2:54:34] meetings.
[2:54:36] But I tell you what, when we got
[2:54:37] together, it was it was around
[2:54:39] fellowship around the word. Amen.
[2:54:41] &gt;&gt; I I have never talked to him about the
[2:54:43] Super Bowl. Never talked to him about
[2:54:46] the Diamondbacks
[2:54:48] or whoever. Uh-uh. I don't talk about
[2:54:51] snakes.
[2:54:54] Diamond back, the rattlers. Nah, stop
[2:54:57] it. Talk about the word.
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I love about you people that
[2:55:03] you pull on it. I told Brother Eric, I
[2:55:05] said, "Brother Eric," I said, "You know
[2:55:08] what I like you about you?" I says, "Cuz
[2:55:11] I I I said, you know what? When
[2:55:13] something really strikes you,
[2:55:16] &gt;&gt; you don't wait for somebody else." Well,
[2:55:17] let me see.
[2:55:19] &gt;&gt; Anybody say an amen?
[2:55:21] &gt;&gt; No. It's his voice comes out.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; And you know what you're doing,
[2:55:27] brother Eric? Do you know what you're
[2:55:29] doing when you do that? You're pulling
[2:55:31] that sermon out of me.
[2:55:33] I feel it. I feel it. That's why I make
[2:55:37] eye contact with some of you during
[2:55:39] service.
[2:55:41] Unless you're falling asleep,
[2:55:44] but I make eye contact with you because
[2:55:46] you know what? You know what it's doing,

[2:56:02] inheritance. Tell me more."
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:56:16] it over to brother Robert. He's going to
[2:56:18] sing another song or so and then we're
[2:56:21] going to let you go and you excuse me
[2:56:24] for having taken overtime
