[28:47] amen amen may the Lord bless you all uh
[28:51] it's a privilege once again to be in the
[28:53] house of the Lord while uh we still
[28:56] standing we'll take the Book of Luke
[29:01] 22:25 to quickly save us some time and
[29:05] he said unto
[29:07] them uh the kings of the Gentiles getze
[29:11] Lord lordship over them and they that
[29:14] exercise Authority upon them are called
[29:17] benefactors I Believe by God's grace we
[29:19] took the verse 20 uh 4 and 25 for the
[29:23] last few
[29:25] Services uh verse 26 but ye shall not be
[29:29] so meaning he had shown to the disciples
[29:32] what the Gentiles were in all those
[29:37] Services uh but he that he is greatest
[29:40] among you let him be as the younger and
[29:43] he that is Chief as he do serve may the
[29:47] Lord bless the reading of his word you
[29:49] may be
[29:50] seated uh we'll be uh continuing with uh
[29:55] the end time
[29:59] and the super race and uh believe this
[30:03] will be part six and for the coming of
[30:07] the Lord in Babylon that will be part
[30:10] five God willing or part four God's
[30:13] grace as uh we looking uh we've been
[30:17] looking
[30:18] into uh this uh subject as uh Jesus was
[30:22] dealing
[30:24] with the disciples in the land
[30:28] in the promised land where they were
[30:30] found and uh surrounded by U the Roman
[30:34] Empire at the time the Lord took them on
[30:38] as side as we remember in Luke 6 Jesus
[30:41] continued all night in prayer and came
[30:44] and uh selected few people to be uh his
[30:50] disciples and along the journey in Jour
[30:52] uh Luke 22 he started now uh looking
[30:56] into their lives because of what seemed
[30:59] to have been so important to them for
[31:02] one to be greater and the other one not
[31:04] to be of uh a less importance but uh as
[31:10] uh we go through uh the whole journey we
[31:14] see that
[31:15] Jesus didn't just pick up the disciples
[31:19] just to for them to
[31:21] be um have name labels that we are in
[31:26] the message of the hour that we are this
[31:28] and you know all that but Jesus picked
[31:31] them up for a very specific purpose
[31:35] because they were under consideration
[31:37] before the foundation of the world and
[31:40] uh the Disciples of course represents
[31:43] the Believers today and uh the son of
[31:47] man we have received in the last hour
[31:50] revealed uh in the form of the W shiv
[31:54] according uh to levitic 23
[31:58] and uh we see that also gives us uh an
[32:01] Insight with Revelation 14 as we saw it
[32:04] last time the third Angel's
[32:06] message uh going all together but then
[32:10] by God's grace we understand that as the
[32:12] Lord gives gives us these things it's
[32:16] not just for us to be set apart and have
[32:19] uh some greater knowledge and uh have a
[32:21] higher language but it is for a
[32:26] transformation uh it is for a physical
[32:29] healing a
[32:30] spiritual spiritual healing and also the
[32:33] healing of the
[32:34] Soul so the importance of uh timing is
[32:39] very important because we we do not
[32:44] understand our time we'll be preaching
[32:46] yesterday message or we will be
[32:48] preaching today's message with yesterday
[32:51] understanding which uh can be really a
[32:54] good strike to the of the enemy to have
[32:57] somebody read brother Bram but then
[33:00] still thinking as if he was living in
[33:03] the 1950s or in the
[33:05] 1960s which would be a great trap it's
[33:08] like you know yeah that's what we have
[33:10] the message when he preached it in 54 no
[33:12] we're not in 53 or in 54 right because
[33:17] uh the angel of the Lord said I am the
[33:20] same yesterday today and forever so
[33:22] therefore if he the same yesterday today
[33:24] and forever what he preached 54 should
[33:28] be also in actuality today because as we
[33:32] are looking around and we are able to
[33:34] see that the world is changing but then
[33:37] in the very same message to you whom uh
[33:41] the word has been given you are able to
[33:43] see it with Clarity that hey this is not
[33:46] something historical that the message is
[33:49] not something to dep to debate upon and
[33:52] as well we see that uh just after 60 65
[33:57] the departure of the Prophet the move
[34:00] had started but in 54 uh in 54 he says
[34:04] that the great upcoming Revival and the
[34:07] outpouring of the Holy Ghost he says but
[34:09] the that church is coming up but just
[34:13] after his departure people picked up the
[34:16] same thing and they start saying the
[34:17] move is
[34:18] on who's right is it in 54 or is it in
[34:23] 66 so when we move forward uh people in
[34:27] the 70s uh they had the experiences and
[34:30] uh they were picking up a few scriptures
[34:33] here and there a few quotations here and
[34:35] there thinking hey 77 we we living but
[34:40] they didn't just look into God's program
[34:42] they did just didn't put everything into
[34:44] place no wonder some left him at a
[34:48] certain point just as Jesus did he took
[34:52] them in the first stage they applauded
[34:54] him for everything that he did after a
[34:57] while a certain number left after a
[34:59] while another number left again and to
[35:02] this day we're still under the same
[35:04] cycle after certain event some people
[35:08] will be leaving but as you said Jesus
[35:12] said that you have Jesus continued all
[35:15] night in
[35:17] prayer yet in the midst of those that
[35:20] Jesus picked up Judas was
[35:23] there and Jesus also knows that Judas
[35:27] has to
[35:28] leave he has to do everything for him to
[35:31] leave I know it's not good to see some
[35:36] of our brothers and sisters leave but
[35:39] according to the scriptures our brother
[35:42] our sister have to leave because it's
[35:46] scriptural because uh if they find a way
[35:49] to get in Jesus said I have to do those
[35:54] things unless I save them L they hear
[35:57] and they repent but the language has
[36:01] been given only to those who were under
[36:05] consideration and uh so therefore it's
[36:07] not a collective thing where oh I heard
[36:11] this you speak of all this this
[36:13] application is right or this application
[36:15] is wrong but then to you to whom the AR
[36:19] where the dove will come and give the
[36:22] leaf opening up another world it's just
[36:26] a glorious element in this hour the same
[36:30] quotations that we reading the same
[36:32] tapes that we
[36:34] hearing some have become
[36:37] polygamist some have become taken set
[36:40] extreme with the very same message so
[36:44] therefore we understand that uh Jesus
[36:46] knows exactly what he's doing and as we
[36:50] are going through the coming of the Lord
[36:53] in Babylon we see that Jesus
[36:58] had to come down or God has to come down
[37:02] or the angel of the Lord had to come
[37:04] down for one
[37:06] purpose because he had a consideration
[37:09] of a certain people and such a people
[37:13] were set there for a good
[37:16] reason which each one of us depending on
[37:20] where we
[37:20] are according to the grace that God has
[37:24] given us some have went into deep into
[37:28] it but as also we look into this it
[37:32] gives us also a clear another
[37:34] understanding to be aware of certain
[37:37] things that surrounds us how to address
[37:42] them because he wants the bride to be
[37:45] perfect be perfect as your father in
[37:47] Heaven is perfect and as long as we
[37:52] still breathing God still has a work to
[37:54] do for
[37:55] us God is still giving us some people to
[37:59] work with God is still revealing unto us
[38:02] some work to work to do and as the Lord
[38:06] is showing these things it makes us
[38:09] aware that the word is not to be
[38:14] historical the word is not to be looked
[38:17] at as something to come to church to
[38:21] show up when the pastor is there to do
[38:24] not show up when he's not there to show
[38:26] up when I can to do not show up when I
[38:29] cannot but the word says if the holy
[38:33] spirit is in you you have to be
[38:37] there besides it nothing else will push
[38:40] you to be there we can have all the
[38:43] explanation we want to give but the word
[38:47] will still be the same yesterday today
[38:50] and
[38:51] forever amen uh we were looking at uh
[38:56] the coming of the Lord last time the
[38:59] Lord came down in Babylon seeing the
[39:01] great nation that the people nimro has
[39:06] built and uh the Lord started showing us
[39:10] that how the spirit of God coming in the
[39:13] form of the angel in the message uh the
[39:16] healing of Jared's daughter I was
[39:19] baptizing them down at the end of Spring
[39:22] Street in Jeffersonville Indiana in Ohio
[39:25] River near 7 or 8,000 people standing in
[39:29] on the bank bear witness that 2 2 2:00
[39:33] in the evening June
[39:35] 1933 how that that a pill of fire came
[39:39] down out of heaven and hung over where I
[39:43] was standing the prophet is uh taking us
[39:46] continuing with uh the thought of the
[39:49] coming of the Lord because uh
[39:53] coming has been a very good debate in
[39:56] this last day what is the coming where
[39:59] did he come has he come has he not come
[40:02] some believe he has not come some
[40:04] believe have come and uh there's all
[40:07] kind of uh Theory or all kind of
[40:11] perception out of all these things here
[40:14] but uh thank God that we have these
[40:16] things on recording and in in writing
[40:19] forms as we can all read that at times
[40:23] you're looking forward so far but the
[40:25] quotation is right there looking at you
[40:27] but you're looking for him so far away
[40:30] and when uh you start looking for him so
[40:33] far away we start conceptualizing when
[40:35] he comes he has to be this way he has to
[40:37] be this way no but it has to be exactly
[40:40] as the word says that is going to be as
[40:44] we read it last time um what is the
[40:47] Revelation the Revelation is God only
[40:49] giving people more information in order
[40:52] for them to understand and receive the
[40:55] prophecy in other words what you read in
[40:58] one place of the scripture that doesn't
[41:00] make any sense wait for the angel of the
[41:03] Lord to come back around again to give
[41:05] you more information for you to
[41:07] understand the first part of the
[41:09] scripture let's not run so quickly with
[41:13] uh doctrines as we like to to call them
[41:17] in the message it says that you know the
[41:21] pillow Fire come down out of heaven and
[41:24] hung over where I standing I believe as
[41:28] message believer we all understand what
[41:30] is heaven because the astronaut have
[41:33] went up there they never got to heaven
[41:35] and they're still exploring they keep
[41:37] exploring and with uh today telescope
[41:40] they can have uh 192 billion like years
[41:44] now that they can capture and they still
[41:46] want to get to that heaven yet but Ram
[41:49] tells us Heaven is right here butam says
[41:52] did you hear that amen is people from
[41:54] the other side it's not people from from
[41:56] this side so let's not look for heaven
[41:59] somewhere out there because as he said
[42:01] like you know the pill of fire came out
[42:03] of Heaven it came from somewhere it just
[42:06] didn't movement of up and down now it's
[42:10] just changing
[42:12] forms and uh the pill of fire came down
[42:15] of heaven and hang over where I was
[42:17] standing but look where did he come from
[42:20] uh the ker General the Mystic light
[42:23] appears over local Baptist Angelic world
[42:26] baptizing at the river very Mystic thing
[42:29] people could not understand many fed at
[42:32] the presence of it the angel of the Lord
[42:35] come right down and hang over where I
[42:38] was 87 then notice on down through life
[42:43] it kept appearing one day under the uh
[42:47] the appearing of this light came forth
[42:50] an angel of the came forth an angel that
[42:53] told me I was to pray for the sick
[42:56] the same angel that came down out of
[42:59] Heaven the same Angel kept appearing
[43:02] unto him hearing voices and this day the
[43:06] the same Angel out of the same form came
[43:09] a man a man who spoke to him at the
[43:12] river gave him a little bit of
[43:14] information he came down and then he
[43:17] comes back around again to give him more
[43:20] information as we saw it last time that
[43:23] the angel was just like anybody it
[43:26] looked like you know
[43:28] Smooth hair to the shoulders
[43:31] barefooted with olive skin what we'll
[43:34] probably call you know skin of our
[43:37] brothers Mexican Brothers the man was
[43:40] standing out there if he had to walk
[43:42] around the city he will just look like
[43:44] any man it wouldn't be any different but
[43:48] then as you go through the message the
[43:50] same Angel comes around with different
[43:52] forms not only the pillow fire because
[43:55] one time he stood there there he looked
[43:57] around the the door and he saw a man
[44:00] looking like an Indian he walked out and
[44:03] said did you people see him he said no
[44:05] we didn't see
[44:07] anybody then he understood who that was
[44:11] when we looking for him in a certain
[44:13] form that if I Lord I'm looking to see
[44:16] you I want to see you don't expect him
[44:18] to appear to you as a Mexican if you're
[44:21] not
[44:23] Mexican that's how he identifies himself
[44:26] many
[44:27] times many of you have asked for the
[44:31] Lord to appear to you and he did come
[44:34] look at in which form did he come to you
[44:37] he didn't come to you like a Mexican
[44:39] brother he came to you in the form that
[44:41] you know the him to
[44:43] be one time you saw your pastor in your
[44:46] dream that was the angel of the Lord one
[44:50] time you were in need on the street and
[44:52] you saw a stranger coming to you that
[44:55] was the angel of of the Lord where did
[44:57] he come from he came from heaven and
[45:00] where was Heaven just
[45:02] nearby looking for him so far but he
[45:05] just around us and that angel of the
[45:08] Lord is coming and he start giving
[45:11] people now more information so they can
[45:13] be able to understand the purpose of
[45:15] their life on Earth that's right so now
[45:18] this Angel of the Lord I told him I
[45:20] couldn't do it that's years ago he told
[45:23] me he told me that God had told me to do
[45:27] so this guy whose life he couldn't
[45:31] understand our very life that we
[45:33] couldn't understand we looking for him
[45:36] and said Lord I don't understand why am
[45:38] I this way why am I different from the
[45:40] rest of the world now that same Angel is
[45:44] coming now in the form of the people
[45:47] that he has appointed in your day for
[45:50] you to be able to start understanding
[45:53] your strange and misunderstood life
[45:55] because school could not understand your
[45:57] life school told you you can do anything
[46:00] that you want but the angel of the Lord
[46:04] comes and tell you exactly what you have
[46:06] to
[46:07] do because school tells you you can be
[46:09] an astronaut you can be a physician you
[46:11] can be but he doesn't tell you exactly
[46:14] what to do but the angel of the Lord
[46:16] comes to him and tells him this is what
[46:19] you are called to do amen and some in
[46:23] the Journey of brother Bram have limited
[46:26] brother Bram to that
[46:27] concept because Revelation is to give
[46:30] people more information to receive and
[46:34] understand the prophecy because the
[46:36] prophecy said I will send you Elijah the
[46:38] prophet but when the angel of the Lord
[46:40] comes he tells him that you are called
[46:42] to pray for the
[46:44] sick but the prophecy is not complete
[46:47] yet right so it is with our lives we
[46:51] born as babies we don't understand they
[46:54] show us this is Papa this is
[46:56] Mama then afterward they send us to
[46:58] school they give us to another
[47:01] leadership and that leadership takes us
[47:04] they just say with more the same way
[47:06] Abraham uh Genesis
[47:08] 11 is under the leadership of his
[47:11] parents in Genesis 12 the Lord takes
[47:14] over because in the same message
[47:17] leadership brother bam shows us that we
[47:19] are brought up from our mothers then she
[47:23] gives us to Our Father who gives us also
[47:25] so to our teacher then to our pastor
[47:28] then afterward then we have to be
[47:30] introduced to the angel of the Lord but
[47:33] bam says many of the converts are done
[47:36] between 17 and 21 years old because Mary
[47:39] received s such visitation around that
[47:42] same age so then each part of our lives
[47:46] are determined to have a certain Angel
[47:50] leader to tell us the portion of Our
[47:53] Lives amen and therefore then according
[47:57] to the part in which we are found we
[48:01] need to pay attention as the angel of
[48:05] the Lord told Moses I behold I send my
[48:08] angel be before you pay attention to him
[48:13] so therefore each one of us as we start
[48:15] identifying the angel of the Lord of in
[48:18] our lives in the form that he's taking
[48:22] we need to pay attention to it because
[48:25] so without that understanding then we
[48:28] are embracing somebody else judgment
[48:31] somebody else Journey but then the Lord
[48:34] puts this pardon of leadership in order
[48:37] for you to be led and for him to receive
[48:40] you but then if you unable to love and
[48:43] to respect and to follow the leadership
[48:46] of the Angel of the Lord that you can
[48:47] see how you going to be able to listen
[48:51] and follow the leadership of the voice
[48:53] of the Angel of the Lord because he has
[48:56] to give you first the sign and then
[48:58] behind the sign follows the
[49:01] voice applying that principle then gives
[49:04] us the understanding that the angel of
[49:06] the Lord led him because baram says and
[49:10] I looked I seen his feet and he and he
[49:15] got to me he was a tall man it was heavy
[49:18] set weight about 200 lb it just looked
[49:21] like just as natural as I'm standing
[49:23] here he had his arm folded
[49:26] folded like this first I never seen him
[49:29] in that form then he sees him in another
[49:32] form in a human form then the angel of
[49:35] the Lord told him he said fear not I
[49:39] knew that was the same voice that spoke
[49:42] to me all along that was the first time
[49:45] I ever seen him like that but I know I
[49:48] knew the voice as he he he said fear not
[49:51] I am send from the presence of the of
[49:54] the almighty God to tell you that your
[49:57] peculiar birth and peculiar life being
[50:00] always misunderstood with men said your
[50:04] per life and particular Birth has been
[50:07] to indicate that you you take a gift of
[50:11] healing to the peoples of the world the
[50:16] angel of the Lord is teaching him is not
[50:19] limiting him but is showing him what the
[50:24] previous teacher could not help him with
[50:28] because Dr Davis couldn't help because
[50:32] that was not given to him to explain to
[50:35] him because Dr Davis could not was not
[50:38] given the ability to explain to him that
[50:41] part of his life Dr Davis could give him
[50:45] a Pulpit to preach a
[50:48] sermon his mother could give him his
[50:50] life story on how on his the day of his
[50:53] birth how a pillar or a light came in
[50:56] the room each one of these Messengers
[51:00] were only giving him a portion of his
[51:04] life that's right so now H has the the
[51:08] the the the the time goes he said now
[51:11] notice then I said but I can't I can't
[51:14] heal no one but I said this I do say the
[51:18] angel of the Lord speaking when I was a
[51:20] baby born up in uh in the in the state
[51:23] of Kentucky according to my own Dear
[51:26] Mother and and in which have been
[51:28] Vindicated through my life I said there
[51:32] was a light came in in the room uh in
[51:36] the room of that little old hle there
[51:40] there wasn't no that where it was where
[51:43] it was at no floor in it they didn't
[51:45] have a window they just had a little old
[51:49] the thing off for a window there a
[51:51] little door uh and and they pushed it
[51:54] open about 5 5 5:00 in the morning and
[51:58] this light circle in just as it was
[52:02] breaking day I said since that time it's
[52:06] been with me it's an angel of God he met
[52:11] me in person few years ago listen to
[52:14] this down through my life he told me
[52:18] things that's happened and I have told
[52:21] them just as he told me and a challenge
[52:25] in anybody at any place to go to the
[52:28] city where I was raised and anywhere
[52:31] else that a statement has ever been made
[52:33] in the name of the Lord but what come
[52:37] just exactly the way it said he would
[52:40] and now not in not me but it was him I
[52:44] said anyone here any Christian knows
[52:48] that God will not have nothing to do
[52:51] with error God is truth from the very
[52:55] birth of the believer where he thought
[52:58] that his life was just a natural life
[53:02] but then this Prophet this messenger
[53:05] these tipes have been given unto us for
[53:08] us to be able to start understanding
[53:11] what is our
[53:13] lives
[53:15] because teach the child the way it
[53:19] should go so that when it shall grow it
[53:21] shall not depart from it and how the
[53:25] teacher going to teach the child without
[53:28] being taught himself amen so therefore
[53:32] the angel of the Lord must come first
[53:34] from the presence of God in order to
[53:37] teach him what to do the son doeth
[53:40] nothing except he has sin first done by
[53:42] the father so the same pattern now being
[53:46] now applied to the parent being applied
[53:49] to the teachers being applied to all
[53:51] these people here that the form in which
[53:55] the angel of the Lord is taking is to
[53:58] reveal to these
[54:00] people what they are what they have to
[54:03] do amen so now as the people now are
[54:08] receiving the gift being sent to them
[54:12] brother bam say they are in a golden
[54:15] age because it is a age of Peace because
[54:20] Dr Davis could not explain certain
[54:22] things it was a time
[54:25] like in the age of
[54:27] reformers certain things could not be
[54:30] clear but then when the gift was sent
[54:34] then the whole story now becomes clear
[54:37] oh I have this gift of preaching oh I
[54:41] have this potential to be a mother or I
[54:43] have this potential to be this based
[54:47] according to the angel that came from
[54:50] the presence of God because they are
[54:53] also the devil being also a angel of
[54:56] Light will also be sent to you to test
[55:00] you if you believe the Lord or not
[55:03] because Martin stood there and an angel
[55:06] appeared unto him with a different
[55:08] program but thank God that Martin has
[55:12] the the the the the scroll with him in
[55:14] order for him to compare the thing
[55:18] because we embracing all kind of
[55:20] teachings we embracing all kind of
[55:22] religions all kind of belief
[55:26] but then without having the Parn having
[55:29] the principle knowing what all these
[55:32] things is all about why the angel of the
[55:35] Lord has to come down then we are just
[55:39] swept along way with everybody
[55:43] else that's right so now as he coming
[55:46] down it says the same Angel if whoever
[55:51] has been in your presence has been
[55:53] telling you certain things
[55:55] and whatever that he has been telling
[55:57] you along the
[55:58] way if these things are to be proven to
[56:03] be tried and to be found true then you
[56:06] can look like the children of Israel
[56:09] that when they were facing the challenge
[56:12] they could say that God of our
[56:15] fathers that's right they were able to
[56:17] speak God of our fathers because these
[56:20] fathers were
[56:22] proven because their lives were tested
[56:26] amen and the faith of Abraham was
[56:29] accepted of the Lord because God had
[56:32] found him that he St not to the promise
[56:35] of God through
[56:38] unbelief and now the people the children
[56:41] of Israel afterward they were able to
[56:43] take the promises because Moses could
[56:47] only take Genesis 15 as a promise of his
[56:51] life based on the fact that Abraham was
[56:55] able to be found worthy to receive the
[56:58] promise of God Amen because Genesis 15
[57:01] speaks your see shall be uh slave or in
[57:05] bondage in a foreign land but I will
[57:08] deliver them with my mighty hand that
[57:10] was the promise given to him so then
[57:13] Moses mother had to take Moses and teach
[57:16] him the scripture that has been
[57:19] proven so it is also with all of us
[57:22] today that when we are looking at our
[57:25] lives we taking this same pardon
[57:27] according to the prophecy that has been
[57:30] given to us as I have done with the
[57:33] prophet so shall I do with you because
[57:35] he has to be the same yesterday today
[57:37] and forever and as he's opening the
[57:40] mystery of him yesterday today and
[57:42] forever we're not just looking at it as
[57:45] of like you know I need healing in the
[57:47] body I need the job I need this year no
[57:51] but the gift the purpose we unto we are
[57:55] called right that Dr Davis could not
[57:58] give to us because uh Moses mother could
[58:02] only teach him that hey go to
[58:06] church pay your tithes dress this way
[58:11] but until the possession from being in
[58:15] the house being in the palace thinking
[58:18] that I have to go through the political
[58:21] system in order for me to guarantee the
[58:24] next stage to to be the governor of the
[58:26] land of of Egypt for me now to take the
[58:29] people out no that was not God's program
[58:33] the teaching was true but the
[58:35] application was
[58:37] wrong so therefore then it required the
[58:40] same mystery of Exodus 3 Moses behind
[58:44] the
[58:45] bush alone with God and has he gets into
[58:49] this pH of looking at the system and
[58:53] looking at the his ability and strips
[58:55] himself away from it then now the angel
[58:58] of the Lord was able to get into
[59:02] action now the B brother says uh Souls
[59:07] that are in prison
[59:08] now the ones out of under the blood they
[59:12] died without Mercy there was Moses last
[59:15] pool first a young man talking to
[59:19] Israel a man that went to school a man
[59:23] that knows how to speak
[59:25] a man that is able to do a lot of things
[59:27] and military training brother Bram says
[59:30] he was a doctor because he went he was
[59:34] educated in the knowledge of of the
[59:38] Egyptians the knowledge that brother
[59:40] says that even to this day we are unable
[59:43] to reproduce how the pyramid was built
[59:46] how did they do it but Moses was taught
[59:49] in the same education and so it is also
[59:53] with all of us today we are taught
[59:55] nurses doctors and accountants and
[59:58] engineers and all these things here but
[1:00:01] despite of all that
[1:00:04] knowledge none of that will be able to
[1:00:07] help us to get into that program because
[1:00:11] the angel of the Lord said I came down
[1:00:14] to see what city that the people of men
[1:00:17] the children of men have
[1:00:19] built that was Moses he was built
[1:00:22] according to the knowledge of the
[1:00:23] Egyptians we are built according to the
[1:00:26] world today how to speak English how to
[1:00:29] speak French how to speak Portuguese
[1:00:32] Spanish and all this year that's what
[1:00:34] the world has taught us that's what our
[1:00:38] previous teachers have demonstrated the
[1:00:40] ability to raise us
[1:00:43] into it's so simple when you have
[1:00:45] somebody who speaks in a certain
[1:00:47] language and clearly according to uh uh
[1:00:51] the paragraphs of uh of of of of of a
[1:00:54] certain language and how to expose how
[1:00:56] to present how to dress and all these
[1:00:58] things though that is good but it's not
[1:01:02] enough it says second went down to
[1:01:06] deliver them and how did he do it it's
[1:01:09] because he went down and dealt with the
[1:01:12] People based with the encounter with the
[1:01:15] angel third was the last message we'll
[1:01:19] get to that I'll skip that for now the
[1:01:21] miracle has has been done Moses was only
[1:01:24] road to the promised land with the
[1:01:26] redeemed oh God be merciful we see that
[1:01:30] Moses before the meeting of the Angel of
[1:01:33] the Lord William Branham before meeting
[1:01:36] the angel of the Lord William Branham
[1:01:38] with the angel of the Lord Moses with
[1:01:40] the angel of the Lord in the form of
[1:01:42] pill of fire and the same Moses the same
[1:01:45] William Bram now God gives him in
[1:01:48] ability gives him a gift reveals to him
[1:01:52] a portion of his life
[1:01:55] right and as Believers also I know these
[1:01:58] things that you know them but as
[1:02:00] Believers that these things now has not
[1:02:03] to be applied in our
[1:02:06] lives to what stage are we at come to
[1:02:10] church listen to a sermon take notes go
[1:02:12] back criticize pray about
[1:02:15] it at what stage are we
[1:02:18] at because if it's just come to church
[1:02:21] come back out come to church come back
[1:02:23] out is the same way that the devil does
[1:02:26] is here present among us because we saw
[1:02:30] that those unconverted Bunch that were
[1:02:33] in the church with a powerful thought
[1:02:37] they were in the church for they wanted
[1:02:40] to fulfill a certain
[1:02:42] purpose so now each one of us would have
[1:02:46] to know what are we here
[1:02:49] for is it the leadership of the
[1:02:52] pastor of the
[1:02:54] mother of the church or I have to go to
[1:02:58] church for the sake of the
[1:03:02] children because we can have our
[1:03:04] religion we're covering up I I have to
[1:03:06] be there because if I'm not there the
[1:03:09] brother will see the sister will see
[1:03:12] because of our hidden
[1:03:14] agendas because we have so many
[1:03:17] agendas let me be faithful later on then
[1:03:20] I get a promotion let me be faithful so
[1:03:23] later on they can them years
[1:03:25] one but the angel of the Lord said I
[1:03:28] come down to see what the children of
[1:03:32] men have
[1:03:33] built what city have you built what
[1:03:36] religion have you
[1:03:38] built because when they were building
[1:03:41] the city that say let's build it so we
[1:03:43] can get
[1:03:44] higher so we can be looked at as people
[1:03:48] of a certain degree so we can be looked
[1:03:51] at as some people of a certain rename
[1:03:54] but the angel of the Lord is also coming
[1:03:56] down veram says that as the time was
[1:04:01] happening people didn't know or people
[1:04:04] were coming into these elements butam
[1:04:08] says well it says in the message God
[1:04:11] providing healing for this generation
[1:04:13] when the serpent used as an insight for
[1:04:16] many after while they got to worshiping
[1:04:20] the serpent instead of God that it
[1:04:23] represented
[1:04:26] the people who had received received the
[1:04:29] teaching all these years now they
[1:04:32] started
[1:04:33] appealing to the angel of the Lord
[1:04:36] Brother what I'm saying never once have
[1:04:38] I ever worshiped the angel of the
[1:04:41] Lord because he knew that that form was
[1:04:45] not to be
[1:04:47] worshiped and today we worship our
[1:04:50] churches we worship our wives we worship
[1:04:54] our jobs we worship all everything that
[1:04:57] we know that we love so much that we
[1:05:00] worship the Lord said I will give you a
[1:05:04] gift go to school learn how to speak
[1:05:09] have some money and the people started
[1:05:12] worshiping the
[1:05:14] job they give more importance to the job
[1:05:16] than any than the word of the the work
[1:05:18] of the Lord PR brother why because
[1:05:22] that's what the Lord in you he had to do
[1:05:25] in order to separate the
[1:05:30] people
[1:05:32] nimro came among the people with a
[1:05:35] powerful thought in mind he wanted to
[1:05:38] lift himself above the stars of God with
[1:05:42] your money how do you see yourself now
[1:05:44] toward
[1:05:47] others with our knowledge how do we
[1:05:50] behave around
[1:05:53] others because with Nimrod he wanted to
[1:05:55] do what he wanted destroy the land and
[1:05:58] divide people call them by race and give
[1:06:01] them a group social low class middle
[1:06:04] class higher class 1% one of the 1% and
[1:06:08] all these things here keep dividing
[1:06:10] dividing dividing the
[1:06:13] people then the Lord comes now and say
[1:06:16] and says I came down to explain to you
[1:06:20] your strange and misunderstood life
[1:06:24] amen after all this year that you've
[1:06:27] been through which side are you taking
[1:06:30] brother bam says you see there was no
[1:06:33] inside there was nothing left that the
[1:06:36] people could seek to see or look upon
[1:06:39] and believe that God will still heal and
[1:06:42] immediately there come a whirlwind down
[1:06:45] out of heaven in the pool of beesa and
[1:06:48] God provided a way of healing to for the
[1:06:50] people and every Israelite that belied
[1:06:53] in in God and believe he was a Healer
[1:06:56] could step into that pool and it was
[1:07:00] troubled and healed of any kind of
[1:07:03] disease he
[1:07:04] had now you're moving
[1:07:07] forward you see that oh well it's not
[1:07:09] just a church attending a church
[1:07:11] attendance itself let me believe in the
[1:07:14] ministers let me believe the prophet but
[1:07:17] God is not
[1:07:20] satisfied God is not satisfied
[1:07:24] the prophet is showing us that people
[1:07:26] were s sitting there in the wilderness
[1:07:30] they had need of healing in the
[1:07:32] body God provided a way of
[1:07:36] healing you come to church you want to
[1:07:38] listen to a sermon God provide a
[1:07:43] minister God provide a
[1:07:46] pastor but God is not
[1:07:48] satisfied because he can see that
[1:07:51] somebody else has his favorite preacher
[1:07:56] he can see somebody is like you know my
[1:07:59] pastor is still this one here my pastor
[1:08:02] is still this one here I can't listen to
[1:08:04] this brother I can't listen to that
[1:08:06] brother why because the idol worshiping
[1:08:10] Spirit has got hold of them because they
[1:08:14] were not under consideration oh my come
[1:08:18] on the ins sign was lifted of
[1:08:22] course God will lift to minister God
[1:08:25] will give you marriage God will give you
[1:08:27] money but watch out where that's taking
[1:08:31] you let's watch out where that is taking
[1:08:35] us then as the Lord as the people were
[1:08:38] doing itam
[1:08:40] says it said that when they started
[1:08:43] doing it then the prophet rose up and
[1:08:47] got the serpent and tore it up tore it
[1:08:49] up that's
[1:08:52] right everything that we have before us
[1:08:56] that we know that is we love so much oh
[1:09:01] me it's such a person when such a person
[1:09:05] before I believe you let me let me
[1:09:07] consult with uh with my brother there
[1:09:10] with the minister there brother bam says
[1:09:12] at the moment that you do that you
[1:09:14] become a
[1:09:16] denomination and in the church edes it
[1:09:19] says I hate that
[1:09:21] thing right God is looking in the midst
[1:09:26] of
[1:09:27] Babylon a people to whom he comes to to
[1:09:32] deal with and so that they can be able
[1:09:35] to know the purpose of their
[1:09:37] lives as God Is Lifting the inside
[1:09:40] before you let's be
[1:09:43] careful he said that there was no insign
[1:09:46] then a God in knew and the Bible
[1:09:49] says says paragraph 23 and a long came
[1:09:54] the Lord Jesus in the days of this the
[1:09:57] pool was just about ready to be done
[1:09:59] away with God has never left the people
[1:10:03] without a provided way for healing and
[1:10:06] just the time the pool was going to be
[1:10:09] done away
[1:10:10] with Titus was going to Siege the walls
[1:10:14] of Jerusalem and burn the city and Jesus
[1:10:18] had prophesies of it Jesus was sent on
[1:10:21] on the scene and he was and he was God's
[1:10:25] provided way of healing each timing was
[1:10:30] very important the overlaping of the
[1:10:33] ages the overlaping of the Ministries
[1:10:36] the overlaping of the prophecies moving
[1:10:39] from one section of the word into
[1:10:42] another section of the word but at the
[1:10:44] same time the Lord says be
[1:10:48] careful watch and
[1:10:51] pray so that you don't leave read the
[1:10:54] message with a yesterday understanding
[1:10:57] am we looking for him we're looking for
[1:11:00] him we're looking for
[1:11:01] him but he said that you know I will
[1:11:04] come
[1:11:05] down and as is coming down in what form
[1:11:09] is he coming
[1:11:10] down in the form that is coming down
[1:11:13] into are we turning that form into an an
[1:11:17] sign to
[1:11:19] worship and even when we start
[1:11:21] worshiping the form then the Lord what
[1:11:24] does the Lord Do It tears it apart puts
[1:11:27] it away and then moves into the another
[1:11:30] Direction because it's only given to the
[1:11:34] Believers amen because if it was not
[1:11:37] given to the Believers all of us would
[1:11:40] have been like 20 million or 7 billion
[1:11:43] of people on Earth would have believed
[1:11:45] the message but thank God as we're
[1:11:48] moving forward the numbers getting
[1:11:50] lesser and lesser and lesser
[1:11:54] why because of the inside the inside has
[1:11:57] become a stumbling block to
[1:12:00] many the inside has become a stumbling
[1:12:02] block because the voice has to come but
[1:12:05] then when before the voice comes before
[1:12:08] the last part of Moses Ministry the
[1:12:11] message to come the Lord has to be
[1:12:15] assured what kind of people am I dealing
[1:12:22] with
[1:12:24] here it is 27 of the same message after
[1:12:28] is going away he said how will not leave
[1:12:31] you
[1:12:32] comfortless I'll give you another
[1:12:36] inside if I be lifted from the earth
[1:12:38] I'll draw all men unto me and the things
[1:12:42] that I do shall you do even greater than
[1:12:45] this for I go unto my
[1:12:48] father and he commissioned human beings
[1:12:51] to go all to to go to go to all the
[1:12:55] world and preach the gospel and
[1:12:57] demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:59] until he returns as a
[1:13:05] sign the same spirit is only carrying on
[1:13:10] with his
[1:13:11] journey but now to the Believers now the
[1:13:15] great mystery of the age is to know
[1:13:18] which form he has taken when he moves
[1:13:21] from one form to another
[1:13:25] quickly we Embrace Idol
[1:13:29] worshiping I can only pay my ti to you I
[1:13:33] can only do this I can only do this to
[1:13:36] this person why because we start
[1:13:39] worshiping the person without even
[1:13:42] realizing yet it's very so
[1:13:44] simple I only love people of my
[1:13:48] community I only love I only visit these
[1:13:50] people that visit me in it is that same
[1:13:54] Spirit it is the same Idol worshiping
[1:13:58] that the devil that nimod had started
[1:14:01] but as now the journey continues on then
[1:14:04] the Lord is looking at the people he
[1:14:06] said like well to you the Believers I am
[1:14:10] Jehovah Gyra I am the one he said did
[1:14:13] you notice the angels that came that
[1:14:18] come down investigated Sodom before
[1:14:21] Sodom was
[1:14:22] destroyed just as it was with Jesus
[1:14:25] before Titus came into the land just as
[1:14:27] it was with Moses before the destruction
[1:14:29] of the Egyptians it is the same way also
[1:14:32] he's bringing us now just before Sodom
[1:14:36] was destroyed the angel also again came
[1:14:41] down where is this Angel
[1:14:44] going why is this Angel keep changing
[1:14:48] forms where is he taking us by him
[1:14:51] coming down for what purpose
[1:14:54] yeah why should we be tracking him from
[1:14:57] one form to
[1:14:59] another why should we be looking for him
[1:15:02] from one person to the
[1:15:04] next can he just have one single form in
[1:15:08] which we can love him and we can worship
[1:15:11] him just as job would say if I knew his
[1:15:15] house I would have went to
[1:15:18] him because they wanted to see him in
[1:15:22] the days of Jesus is say sir we would
[1:15:24] see
[1:15:26] Jesus they were looking for him they are
[1:15:29] looking for him we are looking for him
[1:15:31] even to this
[1:15:33] day Peter Paul says to whom who are
[1:15:36] rejoicing looking unto his
[1:15:40] appearing people are still looking for
[1:15:43] him but then he says I'll come as a
[1:15:47] thief in the
[1:15:49] night and in the night of Babylon he
[1:15:52] comes down down to a specific
[1:15:55] bride in a specific manner so they can
[1:15:59] be able to catch the
[1:16:01] message because as it came down in
[1:16:04] Exodus 3 it was not it was a public show
[1:16:08] to everybody everybody could see the
[1:16:10] first sign everybody could see the
[1:16:13] second sign everybody people could even
[1:16:16] impersonate the first and the
[1:16:18] second but the last part was only
[1:16:21] reserved to a specific group amen yet
[1:16:26] the tape is available to
[1:16:28] all yet everybody Praises play but look
[1:16:32] at the
[1:16:33] result why because of the ins
[1:16:37] sign because the sign the one after a
[1:16:40] sign we will need a sign Billy Paul is
[1:16:42] your sign now before Billy Paul dies he
[1:16:45] has to be young yeah that's your
[1:16:48] sign on after he dies he takes away the
[1:16:51] sign now people are living
[1:16:53] why because the same Angel of the Lord
[1:16:56] does his job he has to cut you out he
[1:17:00] has to put questions he has to give you
[1:17:02] materials for you to leave the
[1:17:07] word we William Bram we need William
[1:17:09] Brenham to come back
[1:17:13] no understand that the angel of the Lord
[1:17:16] who came from the presence of God takes
[1:17:19] a form do does a certain part of the
[1:17:21] work and in move moves to another
[1:17:24] form Don't Preach the message with a
[1:17:27] yesterday
[1:17:31] understanding as is opening as is
[1:17:34] showing in the form of your pastor in
[1:17:36] the form of the minister in the form of
[1:17:38] whosoever that you love so much and all
[1:17:41] these great
[1:17:43] ministers understand that it takes the
[1:17:46] form changes the form and moves on with
[1:17:49] his work amen amen because of the same
[1:17:53] angel that called you because nobody can
[1:17:55] come to me L the father draws him first
[1:17:59] Jesus continued all night in prayer then
[1:18:03] came selecting the
[1:18:06] disciples when he was selecting them he
[1:18:09] was not based upon like I like this
[1:18:11] formam I like this form I like that one
[1:18:15] no he's looking at the seed amen and
[1:18:19] that seed that was planted in different
[1:18:22] form
[1:18:24] that's what he's coming
[1:18:26] onto but he knows that when the son of
[1:18:30] man was planting seed in the field also
[1:18:32] the the other men came also planting the
[1:18:35] seed and all of them all together they
[1:18:37] were crying out to him if we said let's
[1:18:41] pray somebody who knows the message quot
[1:18:45] the message quot the message the BR is
[1:18:47] very
[1:18:49] spiritual that's why we calling the
[1:18:51] message today
[1:18:53] because the person is just is just ping
[1:18:56] out
[1:18:57] knowledge but then watch now where the
[1:18:59] person is going with the
[1:19:01] message quickly you find out he doesn't
[1:19:04] know where the word what what in what
[1:19:07] stage of the program we
[1:19:09] at quickly he wants to be holding on to
[1:19:12] his race or ra holding on to his job
[1:19:16] holding on to this left and
[1:19:19] right I'll prove it with the
[1:19:21] word
[1:19:25] it says you see investigated Sodom
[1:19:29] before before Sodom was destroyed you
[1:19:32] remember that congregation says amen
[1:19:34] there was a bunch of them come down
[1:19:36] three of them one of them stayed with
[1:19:38] Abraham you remember that there were
[1:19:41] lights from heaven we just understood
[1:19:44] what what heaven is that came down in
[1:19:48] the investigating judgment look they all
[1:19:53] they all found around the Pentagon and
[1:19:56] things and find them that's the world
[1:19:59] judgment Sodom and there is one listen
[1:20:02] to this and there is one represented
[1:20:05] will be represented amongst the church
[1:20:10] will be Christ himself vindicating
[1:20:13] himself in heavens above and signs in
[1:20:17] Earth Below certainly and unveiling of
[1:20:21] God and I want you to know to notice the
[1:20:24] form that God chose to talk to job to
[1:20:28] talk to job in job was veiled when he
[1:20:31] talked to job he was veiled in a
[1:20:34] wildwind came down in a
[1:20:36] wildwind you believe that that still
[1:20:39] comes in a whirlwind can come where
[1:20:42] where you see where where you see there
[1:20:45] is several sitting here here and number
[1:20:48] that with other when he came in the
[1:20:51] warwind told us the day before before uh
[1:20:54] brother brother brother benw and then
[1:20:58] when he said take up this rock throw it
[1:21:00] up in the air and say that say the Lord
[1:21:03] you will see it right
[1:21:05] away as is coming along in his
[1:21:10] journey the angel of the Lord who once
[1:21:13] was a
[1:21:14] light who was once was a
[1:21:17] voice and here now he's coming now in
[1:21:20] the form of the
[1:21:21] Whirlwind
[1:21:23] and he says but he will be
[1:21:26] represented Jesus Christ himself in the
[1:21:30] church
[1:21:33] represented where is
[1:21:37] he am where is
[1:21:42] he somebody should have an
[1:21:46] answer
[1:21:47] amen that's where the boldness of the
[1:21:50] believer comes into play where is he
[1:21:58] where is
[1:22:02] he I have to push two three times for
[1:22:04] you to answer
[1:22:08] huh the angel of the Lord is coming down
[1:22:11] he said you see right away and and I
[1:22:15] picked up the rock on the up up the
[1:22:17] mountain to up out of course and he said
[1:22:20] well you said I said well it's very easy
[1:22:24] if you just let your own thinking get
[1:22:26] away and think the Bible
[1:22:29] terms they are selfmade
[1:22:32] being God is Spirit Jesus is the body
[1:22:36] that he was veiled in I said certainly
[1:22:40] Abraham said it was he was one of one uh
[1:22:45] he was the one who talk to him he out to
[1:22:50] know he out to know
[1:22:53] you out to
[1:22:55] know I have to
[1:22:58] know when I meet him I have to
[1:23:01] know because when I see him coming in
[1:23:04] the form of the worldwind when I see him
[1:23:07] appearing when I see him stepping out of
[1:23:09] the light when I see him with a certain
[1:23:12] form I know him amen amen because he's
[1:23:17] been teaching me since my birth all
[1:23:20] along my life by vindicating every
[1:23:23] single word that he spoke to me then
[1:23:27] when I stood there and they took the my
[1:23:29] picture then it becomes his
[1:23:33] picture and when now he's changing form
[1:23:36] I'm should now be aware when I see him
[1:23:39] the next time
[1:23:41] around because job was acquainted with
[1:23:44] the form that he will came
[1:23:47] into and now according to the part of
[1:23:49] the prophecy we are to know know in what
[1:23:53] form that he's
[1:23:57] in it is easy for us to say Amen to that
[1:24:01] but then by God's grace as time goes
[1:24:03] along then he has to challenge if you
[1:24:05] truly believe him in that
[1:24:08] form good he has to challenge you and
[1:24:12] when he comes not to challenge you in
[1:24:14] that form now watch out your true nature
[1:24:17] comes
[1:24:19] out because along the ages
[1:24:23] when Martin went to the king and he
[1:24:25] wanted to see him the fellow didn't
[1:24:28] recognize him in that
[1:24:31] form he stood there and said like you
[1:24:33] know that person of a lower class get
[1:24:36] him out of here then Martin had now to
[1:24:40] show him that he was the angel of the
[1:24:42] Lord in that age then fire now has to
[1:24:45] come under his Pew for him to stand up
[1:24:47] and go and talk to
[1:24:50] him because the fellow on the throne
[1:24:52] thought like you know his position was
[1:24:54] given to him in order for him to have
[1:24:57] all the confidence in the world to lead
[1:24:59] the world in whatever he thought he
[1:25:01] would be
[1:25:03] nice so it is also with us
[1:25:07] today certainly Abraham said he knew
[1:25:10] what he was but 2 213 but
[1:25:14] watch what he had done there to that
[1:25:18] church elect he gave it a chance to
[1:25:23] for also for you to know him for you to
[1:25:27] see him and if you are unable to see
[1:25:31] him are you the church
[1:25:36] elect because he
[1:25:38] says what he done there to that church
[1:25:42] elect he give it a chance to see see see
[1:25:47] what I mean well my God what did he do
[1:25:50] you know we made out of 16 elements of
[1:25:53] the earth potage petroleum and Cosmic
[1:25:56] light and whatever more he just reached
[1:25:59] over and got a handful of atom and
[1:26:01] Cosmic like petroleum and said few step
[1:26:04] into it
[1:26:06] Gabriel he takes the form few step into
[1:26:09] it sister
[1:26:10] so it Tes a form few step into it
[1:26:13] brother
[1:26:15] so because Abraham said that I know him
[1:26:20] from Genesis 12 of my
[1:26:24] how he took me from a m
[1:26:27] leadership Moses will said that I know
[1:26:30] him from gen from Exodus
[1:26:33] 1 how I was the proper
[1:26:36] child now in Exodus 3 I'm standing here
[1:26:42] looking at
[1:26:45] him butam says he come also to the elect
[1:26:50] church for them also Al to know him but
[1:26:54] then in the pentagons they're seeing
[1:26:56] they they're calling out you know
[1:26:58] unidentified unidentified flying
[1:27:04] objects but to the church elect the
[1:27:08] information the understanding is
[1:27:12] given because when you were looking for
[1:27:14] him he stepped out and can helped
[1:27:18] you for a certain purpose then it goes
[1:27:22] further and takes another form to give
[1:27:24] you another much more information so you
[1:27:27] can understand and receive
[1:27:31] him and as you are receiving him it's
[1:27:34] not for you to go about just say like
[1:27:37] you know I believe the
[1:27:42] message and when he give his message to
[1:27:45] Abraham he vanish and turn right back to
[1:27:47] God
[1:27:48] again the minister after the pit it just
[1:27:51] comes back back a man
[1:27:53] again at times he becomes an introvert
[1:27:55] on the pulpit he was talking after the
[1:27:57] pulpit he's standing there he doesn't
[1:27:59] know what to tell
[1:28:01] you because the angel of the Lord just
[1:28:04] used the pottassium and the petroleum
[1:28:07] and then after what he
[1:28:09] disappeared yes sir then now to the
[1:28:12] church elect can you see the
[1:28:15] continuation how it goes from one form
[1:28:17] to another form in the midst of Babylon
[1:28:21] it comes now to tell you your strange
[1:28:24] and misunderstood life
[1:28:26] right at one time is Dad talking the
[1:28:29] next minute the angel of the Lord Billy
[1:28:32] Paul he would have stricken you
[1:28:35] dead you used to him you look at him his
[1:28:39] daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy the
[1:28:41] next minute it's not Daddy
[1:28:47] anymore then
[1:28:49] Abraham They Se after him they able to
[1:28:52] see what is going on you see he says you
[1:28:56] see and when he gives his message to
[1:28:58] Abraham he turn in and vanish and
[1:29:01] chemicals in the wood and coal and
[1:29:03] whatever burning turn back to the Unseen
[1:29:06] I'm so glad my father is like
[1:29:11] that the understanding the
[1:29:15] revelation of how he
[1:29:18] behaves of how him coming down y and how
[1:29:22] he
[1:29:24] performs we are grateful for our
[1:29:27] ministers we are grateful for our
[1:29:29] pastors we are grateful for our
[1:29:33] musicians but then the ins sign should
[1:29:36] not become the object of worship amen
[1:29:40] because the object of worship is God and
[1:29:43] no man has ever seen
[1:29:45] God and when you know how to find that
[1:29:49] God in the nature in the form in
[1:29:52] whatever situation he find himself in
[1:29:54] opening up then you conscious I am after
[1:29:59] him I am following
[1:30:03] him because pastor Pastor I have a
[1:30:06] problem pray for me Pastor I have this
[1:30:07] do this for me pastor pastor pastor
[1:30:09] pastor pastor Pastor the minute the
[1:30:12] pastor dies where is your
[1:30:16] faith what was it built
[1:30:19] upon the minute the prophecy
[1:30:22] told to William
[1:30:24] brandham doesn't come to fulfill in your
[1:30:27] lifetime where is your your faith built
[1:30:32] upon he says he also G the chance to the
[1:30:36] church
[1:30:38] elect because the angel of the Lord came
[1:30:40] from the presence of
[1:30:42] God and what's this shakina Glory
[1:30:46] today to break Beyond the
[1:30:50] Veil to see who God Is Standing before
[1:30:55] you see who God is standing here before
[1:30:58] us the pill of fire is veiled in human
[1:31:02] flesh amen praise the Lord the angel of
[1:31:07] the Lord in the form that we are looking
[1:31:10] for him not with a yesterday
[1:31:13] mindset because when the a sign becomes
[1:31:16] now a stumbling block then the Lord has
[1:31:19] to take it up and tore it apart
[1:31:23] quickly Revelation 4 people started
[1:31:26] worshiping William brandham he said but
[1:31:28] these are true
[1:31:30] Brothers they pay the tights they pay
[1:31:33] the
[1:31:34] offering but they were unable to go
[1:31:36] Beyond the
[1:31:38] Veil they said like you know this is it
[1:31:41] let's worship it and Aaron also came on
[1:31:45] the pulpit and say like this is your god
[1:31:47] worship the worship the car the golden
[1:31:50] C because they were looking for a
[1:31:54] form but the angel of the Lord said I
[1:31:57] came down to
[1:31:59] see and to the church elect something
[1:32:02] too to give them the
[1:32:05] chance but he said I am a jealous
[1:32:09] God I don't share my worship with
[1:32:13] nobody not the pastor not the prophet
[1:32:17] not the wife not the
[1:32:19] husband the husband will be so proud I
[1:32:22] will be providing for you the next
[1:32:24] minute say oh you a little too proud
[1:32:26] watch
[1:32:28] out very quickly the job is
[1:32:30] gone I've made all my investment I'm
[1:32:33] secured quickly the uh the stock market
[1:32:38] crashes where is your
[1:32:42] stand where is where is Faith anchored
[1:32:46] into and to that only to that church
[1:32:48] elect because remember NE Road was to
[1:32:51] acquire the wealth of the world to
[1:32:54] control people's mind to be made a God
[1:32:57] to be lifted up upon the stars of God
[1:33:00] and upon these stars now the chance is
[1:33:03] also
[1:33:05] given I am the only Minister who have
[1:33:09] all the Revelation all of you should
[1:33:12] listen to me
[1:33:15] really you think you know God you think
[1:33:19] you've preached it all you think you've
[1:33:22] understood it all and before you know it
[1:33:25] then job it just meant none in the city
[1:33:29] with all the Revelation then the Lord
[1:33:31] comes to him get up like a man let me
[1:33:33] talk to you where were you when I was
[1:33:35] laying the foundation of the world the
[1:33:36] man didn't have any
[1:33:40] answer David wanted to control the
[1:33:42] people when he say he said let me talk
[1:33:44] to
[1:33:45] you he said like you want to control my
[1:33:49] people you want to lift yourself above
[1:33:51] love
[1:33:53] them when I took you there behind the
[1:33:58] ship when even your brothers couldn't
[1:34:01] even see you there as a
[1:34:03] warrior did you know what your future
[1:34:07] was Samson wanted to lift himself up he
[1:34:11] said like I have the seven SE
[1:34:12] Revelations I can do I can live any kind
[1:34:15] of life you can that's
[1:34:18] right let me show you how it's done and
[1:34:21] puts him there gives the woman the
[1:34:23] mindset to how to seduce him before he
[1:34:26] knows it the the Philistines upon you
[1:34:29] but you don't know what to do
[1:34:31] anymore you thought you
[1:34:35] new at times we become our own inside
[1:34:40] right I am young I am strong I'm smart
[1:34:45] I'm beautiful I am this I am that I am
[1:34:49] this and before you know it
[1:34:52] just a little disease cripples you down
[1:34:55] all that chest is gone all that strength
[1:34:58] is gone then the Lord comes to you who
[1:35:01] are you where did you come
[1:35:06] from what is your
[1:35:09] position what is all that you you were
[1:35:12] showing off
[1:35:14] like he says I also will give a chance
[1:35:19] to the elect
[1:35:20] Church
[1:35:22] the inside the Lord is coming down is
[1:35:25] revealing Our Lives is explaining our
[1:35:27] lives at the same time now we become
[1:35:29] aware that despite of all my youth
[1:35:32] despite of all that I
[1:35:34] am I need to pledge allegiance to him
[1:35:38] not to the form because the form quickly
[1:35:41] will put me into trouble because the
[1:35:44] relationship is not between you and the
[1:35:46] in the inside but it is between you and
[1:35:49] him amen because that spiritual
[1:35:52] relationship between man and God must be
[1:35:55] restored again
[1:35:57] today that pill of fire he says but but
[1:36:00] what does the Shak what did what did he
[1:36:03] do the shbr seed the word that were that
[1:36:07] that we to live on this day by the by
[1:36:11] these promises the Shak Glory ripens
[1:36:14] that Sho bread brings it to pass makes
[1:36:17] it the bread to the to the believer that
[1:36:20] laid in the pages of the Bible year
[1:36:23] after year the word for this age to the
[1:36:26] denomination is a stumbling
[1:36:29] block the people are sitting they are
[1:36:32] looking they say like you know what is
[1:36:35] this
[1:36:36] word how come I can just have a church
[1:36:40] and be satisfied to it how come I can
[1:36:43] just have resting my resting place my my
[1:36:46] my job and everything that we can name
[1:36:49] but he said but to the believer
[1:36:51] get into that
[1:36:53] Veil get into that shoe bread when that
[1:36:57] Sho bread seed is falling to the ground
[1:37:00] watch the Sho bread take the form and
[1:37:03] the journey along your church ages of
[1:37:05] your life and then comes to maturity to
[1:37:08] produce exactly what the angel of the
[1:37:11] Lord came and said I came to explain to
[1:37:14] you your stranger misunderstood
[1:37:16] life now the believer now knows to stay
[1:37:20] focused
[1:37:22] oh what is the am I in contact with the
[1:37:26] angel of the
[1:37:28] Lord because these things should not
[1:37:31] just be
[1:37:32] sermons right because if we are sermons
[1:37:35] we read about brother Bram and counter
[1:37:37] with the angel of the lord we here
[1:37:39] encounter I'm not talking just of you
[1:37:43] having some form of a
[1:37:47] dream because he said I also give the
[1:37:51] the elect Church a
[1:37:54] chance I was there I was walking in the
[1:37:58] woods he said William Brenham do you
[1:38:01] want to walk with
[1:38:05] me because he brought
[1:38:08] him from a Mis misunderstood life to
[1:38:12] where he couldn't know if the angel of
[1:38:14] the Lord was there or not to now to the
[1:38:16] point now he could walk with
[1:38:20] him
[1:38:22] it takes them
[1:38:23] there he has to reveal to him the stages
[1:38:27] of his
[1:38:28] life and as the day the stages of his
[1:38:31] life is being revealed to him I'm not
[1:38:34] historical I'm talking about you as is
[1:38:37] revealing that to him he's becoming
[1:38:41] aware at this stage of the journey I
[1:38:45] can't be there start following ministers
[1:38:48] he went to South Africa ministers tell
[1:38:50] him you know just come with us here
[1:38:53] follow us here but the angel of the Lord
[1:38:55] said come and do what I tell you to
[1:38:59] do then when he comes back around he say
[1:39:03] what did I
[1:39:04] do why did I listen to the ministers he
[1:39:08] say if you want to get in trouble get
[1:39:09] along with the ministers because each
[1:39:12] Minister will come and tell you it's
[1:39:13] this way the next one will tell you it's
[1:39:15] that way have a convention have the same
[1:39:18] title have the ministers come this one
[1:39:21] is left up down up turn around this one
[1:39:24] contradicts this one here left and
[1:39:28] right the church elect had to understand
[1:39:31] that
[1:39:32] too just as William Bram had to
[1:39:35] understand that after understanding it
[1:39:38] then he was
[1:39:39] aware
[1:39:41] brother I hear what you say but let me c
[1:39:45] let me talk to him
[1:39:46] first and this is the place where now
[1:39:50] that same angel of the Lord who's always
[1:39:52] present in this kind of meetings will
[1:39:54] sit there and start revealing to you
[1:39:57] this word in your life
[1:39:59] yes you see that sermon for your life is
[1:40:02] this way you see this year for you it's
[1:40:05] this way by the time you walk out he's
[1:40:10] satisfied not satisfied for you to go
[1:40:12] out alone but it goes with
[1:40:15] you as the woman in the meeting they
[1:40:17] said brother I stood up there I looked
[1:40:20] and I saw the Angel of the Lord right
[1:40:22] next to you after the meeting I saw him
[1:40:25] going with
[1:40:27] you then now we become cautious how this
[1:40:31] this Angel of the Lord come down in the
[1:40:34] midst of mystery
[1:40:36] Babylon in the midst of all that
[1:40:39] Darkness it start now revealing to you
[1:40:42] what is my position what am I supposed
[1:40:45] to do how am I supposed to proceed and
[1:40:49] how am I supposed to go about this
[1:40:51] things then when we become aware of it
[1:40:54] now the word say the third stage of that
[1:40:58] journey is the
[1:41:00] message it's not
[1:41:02] finished you have to be aware what
[1:41:06] Babylon was what form it takes how it
[1:41:09] come it takes us along the way how it
[1:41:12] wants to break us apart from the rest of
[1:41:15] the surroundings and how from that
[1:41:17] surroundings now he has to reveal a
[1:41:20] message
[1:41:23] because the years of
[1:41:25] preparation precedes the
[1:41:28] message and yet throughout the years of
[1:41:31] preparation he's teaching you elements
[1:41:34] for you to be adjusted then in the years
[1:41:37] of the message then you turn around you
[1:41:40] able to understand the language that we
[1:41:43] have later on because we just write it
[1:41:46] here I'm always unable to finish my
[1:41:49] sermons
[1:41:51] went down to deliver
[1:41:54] them third was the last
[1:41:58] message I'm quoting brother
[1:42:01] bam as he's becoming
[1:42:04] aware of these things here now he says
[1:42:09] then later on because under the years of
[1:42:12] preparation you have uh Exodus 12 you
[1:42:15] have you know all the plagues and
[1:42:17] everything that followed it then until
[1:42:20] they find themselves in the
[1:42:21] wilderness then the message comes forth
[1:42:25] now with our lives how did it
[1:42:27] go did we just join the church did we
[1:42:31] just listen to Dad's
[1:42:34] religion was it just something we want
[1:42:37] about and we believe because people say
[1:42:40] like you know B Bram has has been the
[1:42:42] prophet of the
[1:42:44] age is it just because you heard of many
[1:42:47] miracles that he did that differentiated
[1:42:50] him him from the people of his
[1:42:54] time or is it just a group Gathering Oh
[1:42:58] Sister Mida dress that way I can also
[1:43:00] dress that
[1:43:01] way oh because our church dresses that
[1:43:04] way we also think that we should dress
[1:43:06] that way because it's you have those
[1:43:09] quotations in the message yes if the
[1:43:11] church believed that we shouldn't gamble
[1:43:13] we shouldn't drink and smoke and all
[1:43:15] these things here the be members of that
[1:43:18] church will not do
[1:43:19] that that you after those teachers right
[1:43:24] right though that is good but it's not
[1:43:27] enough then you go on onto a
[1:43:30] relationship with him but that's not
[1:43:34] enough because those who went after the
[1:43:36] first and the second pool didn't not all
[1:43:40] make it to the third
[1:43:42] pool then we'll see what happens after
[1:43:46] that may God bless
