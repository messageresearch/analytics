[39:53] Heavenly Father, Lord, this morning it's
[39:56] such an honor to be in your presence,
[39:59] Lord. And where your presence is,
[40:02] Father, there is
[40:03] liberty. There is life, Lord. there is
[40:07] freedom. And so, Father, this morning we
[40:10] ask that by the foolishness of
[40:12] preaching. And by the revelation of your
[40:15] word that you would come, Lord, and
[40:17] break the shackles, Father, take the
[40:20] complexes of life, Lord, and and may you
[40:24] just fill us with life, Lord. Father, we
[40:27] love you and we thank you for this
[40:29] opportunity. I pray that you would bless
[40:31] your people in a special way this
[40:33] morning. In the name of Jesus Christ we
[40:35] pray. Amen.
[40:38] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[40:40] this morning. We welcome you in the name
[40:42] of the Lord. It's good to be in the
[40:43] house of God. Thank you musicians so
[40:46] much. If you have your Bible, turn with
[40:47] me to the book of
[40:49] Luke chapter 24. We just want to greet
[40:53] all our visitors. Brother Aaron and
[40:55] Sister Naomi, God bless you richly. It's
[40:57] real good to see you. Each and everyone,
[41:00] God bless you. We trust that you will be
[41:01] blessed this morning.
[41:04] by God's word. Amen.
[41:07] Luke chap 24, we'll read verses
[41:11] 13 through
[41:14] 27. Very familiar portion of scripture.
[41:17] And behold, two of them went that same
[41:19] day to a village called Emmas, which was
[41:22] from Jerusalem about three score
[41:24] furlongs. And they talked together of
[41:26] all these things which had happened. And
[41:28] it came to pass that while they communed
[41:31] together and reasoned, Jesus himself
[41:34] drew near and went with them, but their
[41:37] eyes were holden that they should not
[41:39] know him. And he said unto them, "What
[41:42] manner of communications are these that
[41:44] ye have one to another, as ye walk, and
[41:47] are sad?" And one of them whose name was
[41:50] uh Cleopus answering said unto him, "Art
[41:54] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and
[41:57] hath not known the things which are come
[41:59] to pass there in these days?" And he
[42:02] said unto them, "What things?" Like he
[42:05] didn't know. And they said unto him
[42:08] concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was
[42:11] a prophet, mighty in deed, and word
[42:14] before God, and all the people, and how
[42:16] the chief priests, and our rulers
[42:18] delivered him to be condemned to death,
[42:19] and have crucified him. But we trusted
[42:22] that it had been he which should have
[42:24] redeemed Israel. And beside all this,
[42:27] today is third day since these things
[42:29] were done. Any wonder they were sad,
[42:32] huh? They were walking. They were
[42:34] defeated. They were depressed. They were
[42:36] sad. Why? Because they thought that he
[42:39] was the one. And they thought, "My, we
[42:42] thought he was the one, but he's not the
[42:44] one." But he was the one. Amen.
[42:49] Uh verse 23. Yay. And certain women also
[42:52] of our company made us astonished, which
[42:55] were early at the separ. And when they
[42:58] found not his body, they came saying
[43:01] that they had also seen a vision of
[43:03] angels and said that he was alive. And
[43:05] certain of them which were with us went
[43:07] to the sephiler and found it even so as
[43:11] the women had said, but him they saw
[43:14] not. And what's very astounding to me
[43:16] when I read this that even with the
[43:18] testimony of the women and even with the
[43:20] testimony of the brethren, they still
[43:23] believed not.
[43:25] They were still sad. Even though they
[43:28] heard testimonies, even though that uh
[43:30] somebody had shared with them, I seen it
[43:32] with my own eyes.
[43:34] Yet they believed not, and they were
[43:36] still sad within their own selves. So
[43:39] Jesus then he said unto them, "Oh fools,
[43:41] and slow of heart to believe all that
[43:44] the prophets have spoken. Ought not
[43:46] Christ to have suffered these things and
[43:48] to enter into his glory? And beginning
[43:50] at Moses and all the prophets, he
[43:52] expounded unto them and all the
[43:54] scriptures the things concerning
[43:57] himself." Amen. You may be seated this
[44:00] morning.
[44:02] I would like to title my sermon this
[44:04] morning, when their eyes were opened,
[44:07] they saw him. That's right.
[44:10] Our scripture reading that we just read
[44:12] is a very familiar portion of scripture
[44:15] to us as brother Brham refers to it many
[44:18] times within his own ministry. And the
[44:20] events of the crucifixion we understand
[44:23] had uh just taken place that there where
[44:26] the Lord Jesus had just been crucified
[44:29] and the Jews had uh conspired against
[44:32] him and they had spoke many lies and
[44:34] came against him with false accusations
[44:36] and they had brought him forth to the to
[44:39] the Romans there uh that he might be put
[44:42] to death. And there at
[44:45] Jerusalem, the most holy place on earth,
[44:48] they, the Jews, the most religious
[44:51] people of earth, crucified him who was
[44:54] the word that was made flesh. Amen.
[44:58] And little did they know at that time
[45:01] when they were conspiring against him
[45:03] and wanting to put him to death and have
[45:06] him suffer all the many things that he
[45:09] suffered through there from the garden
[45:11] of Gethsemane onto uh the time of his
[45:14] death at the crucifixion. But little did
[45:16] they know that in all their lies and
[45:19] falsehoods and planning and and
[45:21] conspiring that it was they were
[45:24] actually playing right along in the line
[45:27] of the will of God that they were
[45:29] actually fulfilling the word of God for
[45:31] their age but not for a good thing but
[45:34] for a bad reason. And so it's it's uh
[45:38] sometimes it's very easy for us to
[45:41] think, well uh I have this situation in
[45:44] my life and and I have this season in my
[45:47] life that I'm going through. And perhaps
[45:49] you're going through a time of of of
[45:51] people conspiring against you, a time of
[45:54] somebody told a lie about you or
[45:56] somebody have said something or done
[45:58] something against you falsely and not
[46:01] honestly and truthfully. I want you to
[46:03] understand that no matter what happens
[46:05] or who says what or what comes to pass
[46:07] or who conspires against you or if it's
[46:10] family co-workers or people at school,
[46:12] it doesn't really matter because it's
[46:14] all playing in the part of God for your
[46:18] life. It all has a purpose in our lives.
[46:23] In uh 1957, God keeps his word. Brother
[46:26] Brandham says this. He says, "Put out
[46:29] put the television out. put television
[46:33] outweigh it is now an uncensored program
[46:36] of all the vulgarity and everything uh
[46:40] let a little the gate is the eye to the
[46:42] soul because remember my sermon title is
[46:45] when their eyes were opened they knew
[46:47] him. So I want to talk a little bit
[46:49] about the eye. So brother Brandham says
[46:52] this continuing the eye is the gate to
[46:54] the soul. him go in and let these little
[46:57] girls go into one of these movies or
[47:00] something or other and and see one of
[47:02] these uh here women out of Hollywood
[47:05] with eight or 10 husbands making love to
[47:07] some man and that little girl will
[47:09] practice the same thing the next day.
[47:13] Let some fantastic nonsense come out out
[47:16] there with some kind of a little old
[47:18] scandal looking skirts or something
[47:20] other like that and watch the American
[47:22] women go to wearing the same thing.
[47:24] That's right. What do you feed on? Let
[47:27] me go into your office, sir, and tell me
[47:29] you're a Christian. Let me let me turn
[47:31] on your radio when I'm in there. And
[47:33] you're listening to some kind of old
[47:35] boogie woogie music. And you're
[47:37] listening to some kind of old and let me
[47:39] see some half-dressed women pinups on
[47:42] the side of your wall. I don't care what
[47:44] you say. I know what your spirit's
[47:48] feeding on. Exactly. That's right.
[47:51] That's exactly right. See, I'd rather
[47:54] have an old home with no rug in the
[47:56] floor.
[47:57] A little old iron bedstead sitting there
[48:00] and an old dresser somewhere or whatever
[48:02] and a little old kitchen table made out
[48:04] of boxes with a sign hanging on it. God
[48:06] bless our home. than all the fine homes
[48:09] in the world. Your pinups and nonsense
[48:12] that you have today and a Bible laying
[48:14] on the table instead of these old love
[48:16] story magazines and things laying around
[48:19] of dirt, filth, and lust and everything
[48:22] else to breed into children. How can you
[48:24] expect anything else but a bunch of
[48:26] infidels and agnostics to answer out?
[48:30] That's true, friends. bring up a child
[48:32] in the way that it should go and him and
[48:36] teach him on the word of God. Amen.
[48:39] Amen. So now it's important for us as
[48:42] believers to take certain quotes like
[48:45] this and not just not just kind of read
[48:48] over it very quickly or or listen over
[48:51] it quickly, but it's it's it's uh
[48:53] important for us as believers now to to
[48:56] take the word of God to take the word of
[48:58] this prophet messenger now and to apply
[49:00] it to our lives and to apply it to our
[49:03] homes because he's laying out a
[49:05] blueprint of how of what should we what
[49:08] we should let into our homes. the kind
[49:10] of music we should be listening to, the
[49:12] way that we should be dressing, how that
[49:14] we should be acting, and the things that
[49:16] that uh that matter most to us. He says,
[49:19] "I don't care about all the fine homes.
[49:21] I don't care about all the materialistic
[49:23] things and the nicest and the nice that.
[49:26] I would rather have something simple and
[49:28] have God in my life than all the things
[49:32] of the world." Amen.
[49:35] Luke 11:34 it says, "The light of the
[49:38] body is the eye." Therefore, when thine
[49:40] eye is single, thy whole body also is
[49:43] full of light. But when thine eye is
[49:45] evil, thy body also is full of darkness.
[49:48] Why? Because the eye is the gateway to
[49:52] the soul. And so, whatever we let in
[49:55] through the sense of our eye, it's going
[49:57] to affect our
[50:00] soul. Amen.
[50:03] So, brother Brandham lays it out for us
[50:05] very plainly and uh throughout his whole
[50:08] ministry actually that uh that that the
[50:12] eye of society that the the eye of
[50:16] society should not set the standard
[50:18] within our lives.
[50:21] society as we know it, whether it's
[50:23] through television or through books or
[50:26] through school or what the people are uh
[50:28] do at work or what the politicians say,
[50:31] what whatever it might be, society
[50:33] should not rule our lives. But the word
[50:36] of God should rule our lives. So if
[50:39] society of what society says, if it's
[50:42] opposite than what the word of God says,
[50:45] I'm going to leave society at the door
[50:47] and take the word of God every day.
[50:49] Amen.
[50:51] But the problem is is through television
[50:54] and through radio programs and
[50:56] uncensored programs and books and love
[50:59] novels and and everything and Disneyland
[51:01] and Disney and whatever it may be. We
[51:05] look at these things and and if you
[51:06] watch something long enough or if
[51:09] somebody tells you something often
[51:11] enough, you'll begin to believe it.
[51:14] So raise up a little a little girl uh
[51:17] under Disney and under fairy tales and
[51:20] all these different things and all of a
[51:22] sudden how they see love is what they
[51:25] see through Disney.
[51:30] It's very interesting because my
[51:32] daughter, she she's in fifth grade.
[51:34] She's 10 years old. And so just getting
[51:37] into that age where uh her and you know
[51:40] her friends at school, they're they're
[51:42] at that age where they're just trying to
[51:44] kind of find themselves. And and as it
[51:46] was just very interesting at the time of
[51:48] of um uh what's it called? Valentine's
[51:52] Day. Oh, this person has a crush on this
[51:56] person and this person has a crush on
[51:59] this and this one said they love that
[52:01] person. I'm thinking, honey, they have
[52:05] no idea what they're talking about. They
[52:09] don't know what a crush is. They don't
[52:11] know what true love is. The only reason
[52:14] that they think they know what a crush
[52:16] and true love is is what they see on the
[52:19] television.
[52:20] And what they're seeing on the
[52:22] television, Brother Brandham said, it's
[52:24] polluting our minds.
[52:27] Because that's not real love. It's lust.
[52:31] That's right.
[52:32] So now through the things that we're
[52:34] watching and the things that are on
[52:36] television and it can start off so
[52:38] innocent as a cartoon, but it's now
[52:41] brooding a spirit
[52:44] of lust
[52:45] within young boys and young girls
[52:50] because it's not true love.
[52:54] And if it's not true love, it's got to
[52:56] be a perversion of love, which is lust.
[53:02] Any wonder so many of our young teenage
[53:06] boys and girls and not just necessarily
[53:09] within the church but just and in the
[53:11] world and le oysia. Any wonder they grow
[53:14] up having problems.
[53:16] Any wonder they grew up not
[53:18] understanding what true love is. They
[53:21] see lust and they think it's love. They
[53:23] see how mom treats dad and dad treats
[53:25] mom within the world and they think
[53:27] that's okay. But when it's not according
[53:29] to the word,
[53:33] it's not okay.
[53:36] So now we have a bunch of young people
[53:38] that grow up to be adults and all of a
[53:41] sudden it's it's it's just profanity and
[53:44] it's filth and society sets the standard
[53:47] within the home. Society sets the
[53:50] standard within our minds and we just
[53:52] think it's normal when it's not normal.
[53:54] I say, "God, help us to take the word of
[53:57] God and to say, "Father, give me the
[54:00] mind of Christ that I may be able to uh
[54:03] discern between good and evil that I may
[54:06] be able to rightly divide the word of
[54:08] truth, not only in my life, but in my
[54:10] family's life also. Lord, God, give us
[54:14] wisdom.
[54:17] We need wisdom more today than ever
[54:19] before.
[54:27] Everything that we see today is is is
[54:30] being driven by somebody.
[54:33] Amen.
[54:35] Who are you letting lead you? Who is it
[54:38] that's telling you what to believe?
[54:41] Instagram,
[54:43] Facebook, YouTube,
[54:46] uncensored programs. What is it? Love
[54:48] novels.
[54:51] The more that we feed upon these things,
[54:55] yeah, the more it defiles our spirits.
[54:58] And then we wonder, my my goodness, I am
[55:01] having such a difficult time because
[55:02] your spirit is defiled because of what
[55:05] we're letting in through the eyes. And
[55:07] it's defiling our spirit and defiling
[55:10] our souls. Amen.
[55:14] But
[55:15] yet, we just think it's normal. Let me I
[55:19] feel like dwelling upon this for a
[55:20] little while and that's okay. You know,
[55:23] I'm only 37 years old, but I I didn't
[55:25] grow up with YouTube. I didn't grow up
[55:28] with the internet. I didn't grow up with
[55:31] the cell phone that had internet and all
[55:32] those things. I remember when the
[55:35] internet first came out. I am so old.
[55:40] Old to some and others are like, "Yeah,
[55:42] you're a whippersnapper, man." And I
[55:45] remember you plugged that thing in and
[55:46] it had to go through the phone line
[55:48] [Music]
[55:52] and you're like, I'll go down and eat a
[55:55] bowl of cereal and come back upstairs
[55:56] and it's still going
[55:59] on cuz it was the new thing. It was
[56:01] cool. I had a I don't know how you
[56:04] pronounce it here, but a Nokia is how we
[56:06] say in Ireland. How do you say it? Nokia
[56:08] here. Nokia. It's a Nokia. Okay. Nokia
[56:12] 5210. This thing, man, was the size of
[56:15] my iPad. It was massive,
[56:18] indestructible, had Tetris on it. There
[56:21] was no there was no um there was no
[56:24] internet on it. There was really nothing
[56:26] bad that you could get up to on it. I
[56:28] think we ought to go back to 5210
[56:30] bricks.
[56:33] None of this sensitive gra uh glass
[56:36] stuff that you have to have glass
[56:38] protectors on it. can bounce it off the
[56:39] wall and it's okay.
[56:43] I think it would help keep our spirits
[56:45] clean. Yes. It would help prevent us
[56:49] from getting on and looking at things
[56:50] and watching videos that perhaps we,
[56:53] let's be honest, shouldn't be watching
[56:56] or listening to.
[56:59] But yet, it's just now it's normal.
[57:02] Yeah. Now it's the cool thing. We got
[57:06] reels and we got shorts and all the
[57:09] Yeah. Look at this guy. Look at that
[57:12] guy. Guy's dumb. Let's watch it again.
[57:15] Let's heart
[57:17] it. You adults do it,
[57:20] too. Yeah. Cool. Wow. An hour goes past
[57:25] and all of a sudden all the little
[57:28] subtleties and all the little music
[57:31] that's behind the reel and the and the
[57:33] the unclean uh gestures and jokes all of
[57:36] a sudden what's it doing to your body?
[57:39] What's it doing to your spirit? It's
[57:42] attacking your spirit. It's defiling
[57:44] your spirit. And then and then we want
[57:46] to serve God.
[57:48] I want to serve God and I and I and I
[57:50] and I want to be a Christian and I and I
[57:52] want to do the what's right. That's God
[57:54] putting that desire within your soul.
[57:57] But when you're feeding your soul on
[57:59] things of the world, understand their
[58:01] enmity with each other and and and God
[58:04] is a gentleman.
[58:07] Let you do it. Oh, I want to serve God
[58:09] and do what's right. Well, start within
[58:12] your home. Start with the eye to the the
[58:16] gate to the soul through the eye of the
[58:18] things that we're looking at in our
[58:21] lives.
[58:23] Help us, Lord.
[58:27] I want to tell you something today that
[58:29] out there is not normal.
[58:32] What society tries to tell you is not
[58:35] normal. and how they try to tell us how
[58:38] we should live our lives and how we
[58:40] should raise our children and how we
[58:41] should not correct our children and and
[58:43] and because correcting our children it
[58:46] causes issues on down in life and and
[58:48] they come up with all this wild wild
[58:51] things. Yeah. We shouldn't be letting
[58:54] society tell us how to live our lives,
[58:57] but we should be looking at this and
[58:59] what does the Bible say? The Bible says
[59:01] spare not the rod.
[59:04] Hey, don't care for his crying. In other
[59:06] words, it's far enough from his heart.
[59:08] It's not going to kill them, but it's
[59:10] going to bring forth fruit in their
[59:12] lives. You know, God does the same thing
[59:15] with us. Hey, lets us go to a certain uh
[59:19] uh so far. And he says, "Ah, that's
[59:21] enough, Stephen. I've had enough of
[59:23] this." He gives us a little bit of
[59:24] five-fold correction, doesn't he? You
[59:27] know why he does that? Because he loves
[59:29] us. Thank you, Lord.
[59:33] I've shared this before, but it comes to
[59:35] mind. Henry, he he told us one day, he
[59:38] said, "You know, mom and
[59:41] dad, you spank us because you love us."
[59:45] Yeah. Yeah. You got it. We're like,
[59:48] "Finally, he
[59:50] understands. He gets it." And he looks
[59:52] at us. He goes, "That makes no
[59:59] sense. Makes no sense.
[1:00:02] to a three-year-old. I guess it makes no
[1:00:04] sense. Understand? When we're babes in
[1:00:06] Christ, it doesn't make sense. When God
[1:00:08] comes along and he corrects us, but
[1:00:11] those who he loves, what does he do? He
[1:00:13] corrects. So, be be quick to repent when
[1:00:17] God corrects us.
[1:00:20] Hallelujah.
[1:00:23] Our lives should be about the word and
[1:00:26] not the world. Yes. Our lives should be
[1:00:30] fed upon the word and not the world. Our
[1:00:34] homes should be according to the word
[1:00:37] and not the world. Our our our lives,
[1:00:41] like I already said, should be about the
[1:00:43] word,
[1:00:44] feeding upon the word and not feeding
[1:00:48] upon the world.
[1:00:52] Hallelujah. So now we've heard it time
[1:00:56] and time again where brother Brandham
[1:00:58] talks about applying the token to our
[1:01:00] homes. And I got to thinking, well, what
[1:01:03] exactly does it mean to apply the token?
[1:01:06] Because as the heads of our homes, we
[1:01:08] say, I'm going to apply the token over
[1:01:10] my home and I'm the head of the home and
[1:01:12] and I'm going to apply the the blood
[1:01:14] over the door lentils and and and I'm
[1:01:16] going to apply the token and and my
[1:01:18] family is going to come under the token,
[1:01:20] and it's going to be okay.
[1:01:22] Well, I want to ask you something. What
[1:01:24] does it mean to apply the token to our
[1:01:28] homes and to our lives?
[1:01:30] Does it mean just praying and saying, "I
[1:01:32] apply the token." The token here tooken.
[1:01:36] I apply it. I apply the token over this
[1:01:39] piano that it plays no bad music. Apply
[1:01:43] the token. I apply the token over the Is
[1:01:46] that what it means? like it's just a a
[1:01:48] verbal announcement that you're saying I
[1:01:51] apply the token over my household. I
[1:01:54] apply the token over this. No, applying
[1:01:56] the token is a physical act. Applying
[1:01:59] the token is actually getting into
[1:02:02] action and doing something.
[1:02:08] Now watch this. God's power of
[1:02:11] transformation. What does it actually
[1:02:13] what? Let me just continue there. Like
[1:02:15] what does it mean to apply the token to
[1:02:17] our homes? I'll tell you what it means.
[1:02:19] It means to kick out the TV. Go listen
[1:02:22] to the token message. Means to kick out
[1:02:25] the TV, the uncensored programs, the
[1:02:27] boogie woogie music. There's no boogie
[1:02:29] moogie music nowadays. You guys don't
[1:02:32] listen to that. Rap music, R&B, uh
[1:02:36] Christian rock, country Christian,
[1:02:39] whatever it might be. Applying the token
[1:02:42] means I don't apply the the token to my
[1:02:45] iPad. I apply it. No. Applying the
[1:02:48] token, it means you get the trash off of
[1:02:50] it. Amen. Applying the token means you
[1:02:52] get the love novels. We kick them out.
[1:02:54] Applying the token means that we clean
[1:02:56] up our lives and we clean up our homes.
[1:02:59] And it starts with us as the head of
[1:03:02] every home.
[1:03:04] Amen. I don't care whether you're
[1:03:06] single, whether you're married with no
[1:03:08] kids, whether you're married with a
[1:03:10] bunch of kids, you have a responsibility
[1:03:15] to apply the token to your home and to
[1:03:19] your own life.
[1:03:22] Not just verbally,
[1:03:24] but physically getting into action and
[1:03:27] cleaning it up. Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] Power transformation. And that little
[1:03:34] inside of the inside, that's where you
[1:03:36] start, which is your soul. 1965. Then
[1:03:39] come from that, you're a spirit. And
[1:03:41] then you become a living being. Now the
[1:03:43] living being has five senses to contact.
[1:03:45] The second has five senses. That's the
[1:03:47] outside body. See, taste, feel, smell,
[1:03:49] and hear. The inside body has love and
[1:03:52] conscious and so forth. Five senses. But
[1:03:54] the inside of the inside, the control
[1:03:56] tower is either God or Satan. How many
[1:03:59] knows he's talking about the soul? So
[1:04:02] within the soul it's either God or
[1:04:05] Satan. We have the outside realm. See
[1:04:08] feast smell and here which which
[1:04:10] attracts our earthly home. Then we have
[1:04:12] our five senses of the in of the inner
[1:04:15] man. Brother Martin spoke on it
[1:04:17] Wednesday night of love and conscious
[1:04:19] memory reasonings and so forth. But with
[1:04:22] the inside of the inside is either Satan
[1:04:26] or God.
[1:04:28] But whichever one you feed the most
[1:04:33] is the kind of life that we're going to
[1:04:35] produce.
[1:04:38] He says it's either God or Satan. You
[1:04:41] can mimic any of these things you can
[1:04:43] contact like a Christian or you could
[1:04:45] cast out devils like a Christian. But
[1:04:48] the inside control tower, the beginning,
[1:04:51] the origin isn't of God. It'll never
[1:04:55] return to God. Amen. Very, very
[1:04:58] interesting. So, you can cast out
[1:04:59] devils. You can you can be a Christian
[1:05:02] and you can act like a Christian. You
[1:05:04] could feed your soul on Christian
[1:05:06] things, but if it never originated from
[1:05:09] God, it'll never go back to God again.
[1:05:15] It's pretty outstanding teaching.
[1:05:18] He says, "But the if the origin isn't of
[1:05:21] God, it'll never return to God." You
[1:05:23] understand? Did not Judas cast out
[1:05:26] devils? Did not Caiaphas, the one who
[1:05:28] condemned him and put him to death, even
[1:05:30] prophesy? But he couldn't stay with the
[1:05:33] word. See? Wow. That's right. So,
[1:05:36] brother Brandham now is he is showing us
[1:05:38] and he is teaching us that we can act
[1:05:41] like Christians. We can speak in
[1:05:43] tongues. We can have many manifestations
[1:05:46] of the spirit. But if that soul never
[1:05:48] came from God, which is the seed gene of
[1:05:51] God, it'll never go back to God. And so
[1:05:54] that's where the scripture talks of
[1:05:56] Lord, Lord, yeah, did I not do many
[1:05:59] miracles in your name? Did I not cast
[1:06:01] out devils in your name? Did I not do
[1:06:04] this? And did I not do that? And and and
[1:06:07] the Bible, he didn't deny their works,
[1:06:10] but he said, "I never knew you."
[1:06:13] Get out of here. He cast them out into
[1:06:15] darkness. He never birthed them. Why
[1:06:19] were they never birthed even though they
[1:06:21] did the works of God? Because brother
[1:06:23] Brandham said this. He said only the
[1:06:26] redeemed. Only the the elect of God can
[1:06:30] be reborn.
[1:06:32] He said you didn't become reborn. He
[1:06:36] said you became reborn because you could
[1:06:38] be reborn. You became redeemed because
[1:06:41] you were redeemable.
[1:06:44] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So, it's
[1:06:46] not about the works and it's not about
[1:06:49] the manifestations of the spirit because
[1:06:52] we can mimic any of those
[1:06:54] manifestations.
[1:06:56] It does not mean that a true seed can't
[1:06:59] produce those manifestations.
[1:07:03] But we need to divide the word of God
[1:07:05] because Caiaphas prophesied. Yes. I
[1:07:09] wonder how many of us if someone was to
[1:07:12] raise up and prophesy and it and it came
[1:07:14] true and it came to pass that we would
[1:07:16] want to follow that man. But brother
[1:07:19] Brandham said he couldn't stay with the
[1:07:22] word. Amen.
[1:07:24] So in other words, if somebody strays
[1:07:27] from the word, no matter how many
[1:07:30] manifestations that they got following
[1:07:33] their lives, we should not follow that
[1:07:36] man because it's all about the word.
[1:07:41] Exactly.
[1:07:45] The elect is the only ones that could be
[1:07:47] reborn. Now watch this. This is
[1:07:50] interesting. when I when I when this
[1:07:52] began to come to me. But a seed of God
[1:07:56] can also a seed gene of God can also
[1:07:59] feed his soul on the wrong things
[1:08:01] through the gateway of the eye and
[1:08:03] therefore bring forth the wrong fruits
[1:08:06] in his or hers life. Yes. So, a seed
[1:08:10] gene of God has a soul that came from
[1:08:14] God and it'll go back to God and it's
[1:08:17] and it can be reborn and it will be
[1:08:20] reborn in the correct season and the
[1:08:23] right timing of God. Amen. But even
[1:08:26] though as a regenerated son or daughter
[1:08:29] of God with a soul from God uh see gene
[1:08:32] of God within us, if we're feeding upon
[1:08:35] the wrong things through the gate of the
[1:08:37] eye, which is the gateway to the soul,
[1:08:40] it's going to affect our lives whether
[1:08:43] we're seeing gene or not. The same as
[1:08:46] what a person whose soul uh cannot be
[1:08:50] regenerated, they can do Christian acts
[1:08:52] and they can listen to Christian music.
[1:08:54] They can sing Christian songs and and
[1:08:56] try to be as much of a Christian as they
[1:08:59] can and they can produce the fruits of
[1:09:01] the Christian, right? But yet their soul
[1:09:04] didn't come from God. So can a believer
[1:09:08] who has a segene of God yet produce bad
[1:09:11] works in their life because they are
[1:09:15] they are feeding upon the wrong thing.
[1:09:19] Help us Lord.
[1:09:21] A lot of sons and daughters of God, you
[1:09:24] know, uh they're up and they're down and
[1:09:26] they're in and they're out and and and
[1:09:28] one minute they got it and next minute
[1:09:30] they don't got it. And and and and and
[1:09:32] they have a desire to serve God. And and
[1:09:35] as a minister and as believers, we would
[1:09:37] say, you know, if you got a desire to
[1:09:39] serve God, it's because God put the
[1:09:41] desire there. And so then it comes down
[1:09:44] to, well, I don't understand. If I was a
[1:09:46] believer and if I was a Christian, why
[1:09:49] am I falling so short? Why am I giving
[1:09:52] in to these temptations of the world and
[1:09:54] within my life and complexes and so
[1:09:57] forth? It's because of what we're
[1:09:59] feeding on. Very good. So, it's not that
[1:10:02] you're not seed, right? It's not that
[1:10:04] you're not a son or daughter of God.
[1:10:06] It's not that you haven't had an
[1:10:08] experience with God. It's just because
[1:10:11] what you're feeding upon is bringing
[1:10:13] forth the wrong kind of fruit in your
[1:10:15] life. Very good. And that's where we can
[1:10:18] get um
[1:10:20] uh what's it called? Uh uh we can get
[1:10:24] very um confused. Confused. Thank you.
[1:10:28] Say it in French.
[1:10:30] Confusion. Yeah. See,
[1:10:35] confusion. It can be very confusing. We
[1:10:38] can become very confused within
[1:10:40] ourselves when we don't know who we are
[1:10:42] exactly and we're thinking my if I was a
[1:10:45] son or daughter of God I would have the
[1:10:46] fruit of the spirit and I would be doing
[1:10:48] this and I would be doing that. But you
[1:10:50] are a son and daughter of God and you
[1:10:53] should be pro uh producing the right
[1:10:55] kind of fruits but
[1:10:57] because because you're not applying the
[1:10:59] token
[1:11:02] now the fruits of unrighteousness is
[1:11:05] having its way in our lives. Not because
[1:11:07] you're not saved, cuz you're not
[1:11:10] applying the token like you should be.
[1:11:14] Goes from the youngest to the oldest.
[1:11:16] You think, well, he's just talking to
[1:11:17] the young people. Nonsense. It's from
[1:11:19] the youngest to the oldest, from the
[1:11:21] front to the back, from the preacher to
[1:11:23] the janitor, whoever it may be. If we're
[1:11:25] feeding on the wrong things, it's going
[1:11:28] to bring forth the wrong kind of lies.
[1:11:33] And you find yourself in a cycle. Yeah.
[1:11:37] Well, if I could just get born again, if
[1:11:39] I could just get the Holy Ghost, oh,
[1:11:41] it'll change everything. It changes you.
[1:11:45] It does. But if you begin to yield
[1:11:48] yourself to the wrong thing,
[1:11:51] it'll bring forth the wrong kind of
[1:11:53] life.
[1:11:54] Man, yesterday, and I'll just be honest
[1:11:56] with you, yesterday I was uh trying to
[1:12:00] pray and and and and even even Friday, I
[1:12:03] just I just felt like within my spirit,
[1:12:05] I
[1:12:07] was, man, you ever get like that? You
[1:12:10] just get fed up. And it's really for no
[1:12:13] reason. You know, they say true
[1:12:15] depression. People who are truly
[1:12:16] depressed, they're depressed for no
[1:12:19] reason.
[1:12:22] That's true depression.
[1:12:24] It's not because, well, this happened
[1:12:25] and I'm depressed. No, true depression.
[1:12:28] People who really suffer uh from bad
[1:12:31] depression, they're depressed for no
[1:12:33] reason. They could have the best day
[1:12:34] ever and it's raining on them.
[1:12:38] I had a wonderful day, but
[1:12:42] yeah, it was good. But you ever get like
[1:12:44] that? You just get fed up and you feel
[1:12:46] like nothing's good enough. And I and I
[1:12:48] was trying to pray and I was trying to
[1:12:50] and and and all of a sudden I'm having
[1:12:52] these thoughts that are coming to me.
[1:12:54] I'm like, my goodness, what is going on?
[1:12:58] So instead of trying to fight it, you
[1:13:00] know what we normally do? Here's what I
[1:13:02] do a lot of times whenever uh and this
[1:13:05] is a Capricorn thing. I don't know any
[1:13:07] Capricorns are the same way, but you
[1:13:09] might be. I'll pray for you, man. You
[1:13:12] just run with it. Sometimes you get a
[1:13:14] thought in your mind and you're like,
[1:13:16] "Yeah, wow. Yeah, that's right." And all
[1:13:19] of a sudden in your mind, you're you're
[1:13:22] way out here thinking about something
[1:13:24] that you shouldn't be thinking about.
[1:13:26] True. About a person or a situation or
[1:13:29] whatever it may be. And I said, and I
[1:13:31] got to praying and I said, "Lord, you
[1:13:33] know what this is, right? I'm teaching
[1:13:34] you how to fight."
[1:13:37] I got down to my I said, "Father,
[1:13:40] cleanse my spirit." Yes,
[1:13:44] my spirit is defiled for whatever
[1:13:46] reason, Lord. And it's in my mind and I
[1:13:49] can't get rid of it. And I need you to
[1:13:51] come and to cleanse the pallet of my
[1:13:54] mind with your Holy Spirit cuz how can I
[1:13:56] have the mind of Christ with a carnal
[1:13:58] mind, Father? Next thing I knew, it was
[1:14:01] it was gone. And I was able. You can't
[1:14:04] fight this fight alone. You can't do it
[1:14:07] yourself. You got to go to God. Amen.
[1:14:10] Because God is our victory.
[1:14:13] But the more you try to fight it
[1:14:15] yourself in the battle of the mind,
[1:14:17] you'll go insane. You were not designed
[1:14:21] to fight it yourself. You were not
[1:14:23] designed to carry the load of sin in
[1:14:26] this age. That's why Christ died for
[1:14:28] you.
[1:14:30] He said, "Take my burden for my burden
[1:14:33] is easy and my yoke is light.
[1:14:38] Hallelujah. Beautiful.
[1:14:42] Father, help us. You want to feed your
[1:14:46] soul, feed it upon the word
[1:14:50] and not the world. Very good. And you'll
[1:14:54] find in your life, because I have found
[1:14:57] this to be true, that whenever we begin
[1:14:59] to apply the token to our lives and to
[1:15:02] our homes of things that creep in and we
[1:15:05] kick out the things of the world, that
[1:15:07] we have more of a hunger for the word.
[1:15:09] And when we do fall short, guess what?
[1:15:11] We're not thinking, well, uh, I guess
[1:15:14] I'm not part of him. No, we say,
[1:15:15] "Father, thank you for your for your
[1:15:18] blood. Yes. Thank you that it cleanses
[1:15:21] me from all of my sins and
[1:15:23] unrighteousness.
[1:15:27] Hallelujah. You know how to come under
[1:15:29] the blood. The blood has a voice and the
[1:15:32] voice is the word. Hallelujah. The
[1:15:36] bleeding word of the hour. Amen. Praise
[1:15:39] the Lord.
[1:15:42] Looking at the unseen 1958. a man and a
[1:15:46] man's physical being to be taken care of
[1:15:48] is not all the reason God put him on the
[1:15:50] earth. Notice that because what he does
[1:15:53] with this physical being amounts to very
[1:15:57] little. It's his soul which counts.
[1:16:01] It's the inward man that did not come
[1:16:03] from the earth. It come from heaven. And
[1:16:06] that's the eternal part of the human
[1:16:08] being. But yet strange that he tries to
[1:16:10] figure his own way out. And we find it
[1:16:14] so in the scriptures that when a man
[1:16:15] chooses to walk in his own way and do
[1:16:17] the way he wants to, God just lets him
[1:16:20] alone.
[1:16:22] Wow. Well, I'm going to do what I want
[1:16:25] to do. Guess what? God's going to let
[1:16:26] you do what you want to do. He's going
[1:16:28] to leave you alone. I don't want to be
[1:16:31] alone. I want to be in his hands.
[1:16:37] Man must not think of himself but he
[1:16:40] must let must think for
[1:16:43] himself but he must let the mind that
[1:16:46] was in Christ be in him. We are not to
[1:16:49] think for ourself. We are to call
[1:16:52] anything contrary to what he has said as
[1:16:55] though it is not. No matter what our
[1:16:57] eyes claim to be. We do not live by what
[1:17:00] we see. We live by what we believe. We
[1:17:05] are not to live by what we see or how
[1:17:07] society tells us how we should live our
[1:17:09] lives. But we are to live our lives
[1:17:12] according to what we believe.
[1:17:17] Our lives is an open book. Our lives, if
[1:17:21] I could say, is is like a like a monitor
[1:17:24] or like a screen like up here. And if
[1:17:27] you want to see what somebody believes,
[1:17:30] watch their life. Wow.
[1:17:34] So you say, "Well, this person is acting
[1:17:36] and doing this way and this." Well,
[1:17:38] they're just acting out what they
[1:17:40] believe.
[1:17:42] Young people, what do they do? You see,
[1:17:45] they have a hard time around the teenage
[1:17:47] years and and everything. And you
[1:17:49] wonder, well, what's going on? They're
[1:17:52] acting out what they believe. Amen.
[1:17:55] Because mom and dad beliefs can only
[1:17:57] take us so far. That's true. At some
[1:17:59] point, you've got to live what you
[1:18:02] believe yourself.
[1:18:06] And
[1:18:06] everybody can see it.
[1:18:10] So your life, my life, how I live, how I
[1:18:13] talk, what I do, where I go, where I
[1:18:15] don't go, what I watch, what I don't
[1:18:17] watch, what I listen to, what I don't
[1:18:18] listen to, when I'm on my own, when I'm
[1:18:20] with other people. Everything that I do
[1:18:22] in my life is a response of what I
[1:18:28] believe.
[1:18:30] That's why I say, Father, help thou my
[1:18:33] unbelief.
[1:18:35] Because I want to believe because the
[1:18:37] things that we believe will produce a
[1:18:41] life and I want to have his life
[1:18:49] looking at the unseen. Paragraph 27. We
[1:18:53] might go on for several hours speaking
[1:18:55] of the modern day of how men and women
[1:18:57] today just completely look and they go
[1:19:00] down the street. They're going to choose
[1:19:01] a church that they must go to and bring
[1:19:03] up their children in. They'll search
[1:19:05] around through the city not trying to
[1:19:06] find the most spiritual church but the
[1:19:08] biggest church that they can find.
[1:19:10] That's the one uh got the greatest
[1:19:12] crowds and the best dressed and the
[1:19:14] celebrity of the city goes to this such
[1:19:16] church where it's called the better
[1:19:18] class as far as men know. And then in
[1:19:21] that church they'll try to find a
[1:19:23] minister that's what they call not
[1:19:25] narrow-minded that'll just about let
[1:19:27] them live any way they wish to and
[1:19:30] belong to that church. So, Brother
[1:19:32] Brandham's talking about the carnal man
[1:19:35] that wants to go to church and he'll
[1:19:37] find a pastor and he'll find a a
[1:19:39] preacher that'll just be so
[1:19:40] narrow-minded and let the people live
[1:19:42] whatever kind of way they want. Now, he
[1:19:44] goes to the spiritual
[1:19:46] man. He says, "But the spiritual man on
[1:19:49] the inside, if you'll give them the
[1:19:50] right away, he might lead you out to a
[1:19:53] little mission
[1:19:55] somewhere where there is not many
[1:19:57] people, but there is the spirit of the
[1:19:59] living God. For the outside man feeds on
[1:20:02] psychology and intellectual, but the
[1:20:05] inside man feeds on the word of God.
[1:20:08] Amen.
[1:20:10] In order for you to be the word
[1:20:13] made flesh in this day, you've got to
[1:20:16] feed upon the word
[1:20:19] of this day.
[1:20:24] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:27] This message is not for everyone.
[1:20:30] Therefore, not everyone is going to
[1:20:32] receive it. This has been the way
[1:20:35] throughout all of the scriptures. It
[1:20:36] kills me to say that. Do you know that?
[1:20:39] Because part of me thinks that that's
[1:20:43] not fair. And it's not fair to say, but
[1:20:47] yet it's God's way. Amen. So, I I
[1:20:51] wrestle with
[1:20:52] that because I've been chosen. I'm so
[1:20:55] grateful. But you want everybody else to
[1:20:58] be chosen as well. You don't want to be
[1:21:00] puffed up and be a stuffed shirt and and
[1:21:02] and and look down on other people. But
[1:21:04] just facts are facts. This message isn't
[1:21:07] for everybody. Amen. Isaiah
[1:21:09] 44:18. They have not known nor
[1:21:12] understood. For he has shut their eyes.
[1:21:14] Who is he? It's God. That they cannot
[1:21:17] see in their hearts that they cannot
[1:21:19] understand. Matthew 13:es 13-15.
[1:21:23] Therefore, speak guide to them in
[1:21:25] parables, because they seeing see not,
[1:21:29] and hearing they hear not. Neither do
[1:21:31] they understand. So, they have eyes, but
[1:21:33] yet they're fulfilling the prophecy of
[1:21:36] of Isaiah that they have eyes to see.
[1:21:38] They can see plainly, but spiritually
[1:21:41] they see not. Why can they not see
[1:21:44] spiritually? Because their eyes have
[1:21:46] been holden to the word.
[1:21:50] It's not their fault.
[1:21:52] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[1:21:55] Isaiah, which saith, by hearing you
[1:21:57] shall hear and shall not understand, and
[1:21:59] seeing you shall see and not perceive.
[1:22:01] For this people's heart is wacked gross,
[1:22:03] and their eyes are full of hearing, and
[1:22:05] their eyes have been have their eyes
[1:22:08] have they closed, lest at any time they
[1:22:11] should see with their eyes, and hear
[1:22:13] with their ears, and should understand
[1:22:14] with their heart, and should be
[1:22:16] converted, and I should heal them.
[1:22:20] 2 Corinthians 2:es 10-12. And with all
[1:22:24] deceivleness of unrighteousness in them
[1:22:26] that perish because they receive not the
[1:22:29] love of the truth that they might be
[1:22:32] saved. How do we be saved in this hour?
[1:22:35] By receiving with love the truth. Wow.
[1:22:43] And for this cause God shall send them
[1:22:45] strong delusion that they should believe
[1:22:47] a lie. Notice who does it. It's God that
[1:22:50] does it. It's God that shuts the eyes of
[1:22:53] one and opens the eyes of the other.
[1:22:56] Therefore, is God an unrighteous judge?
[1:22:59] God forbid because he knows who is his
[1:23:02] and who is not.
[1:23:06] 2 Corinthians 4:es 1-4. Therefore,
[1:23:10] seeing we have this ministry as we have
[1:23:12] received mercy, we faint not, but have
[1:23:14] renounced the hidden things of
[1:23:16] dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
[1:23:19] nor handling the word of God
[1:23:21] deceitfully, but by manifestation of the
[1:23:24] truth, commending ourselves to every
[1:23:26] man's conscience in the sight of God.
[1:23:28] But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to
[1:23:32] them that are lost.
[1:23:38] Wow.
[1:23:39] They are already lost.
[1:23:43] It's
[1:23:45] amazing. What does this do for you,
[1:23:47] brother Stephen, to preach this this the
[1:23:50] to go down this line? I'm preaching on
[1:23:52] on on on the eyes and I'm preaching on
[1:23:54] when their eyes were open, but I also
[1:23:56] want to just briefly touch on those
[1:23:59] whose eyes are closed.
[1:24:02] Why are they closed? Because God closed
[1:24:04] their eyes. Why did the Jews reject
[1:24:06] Jesus Christ? because their eyes were
[1:24:09] closed to the truth in the hour in which
[1:24:12] they were living in. It wasn't their
[1:24:14] fault because God wanted to bring in a
[1:24:17] gentile people, a gentile dispensation
[1:24:20] who he would open their eyes who were
[1:24:23] wild by nature.
[1:24:26] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. He
[1:24:28] shuts the eyes of one and gives grace to
[1:24:30] another one. What does this do for you,
[1:24:32] brother Stephen? It makes me cry out
[1:24:34] grace. Oh, the grace of God in my life
[1:24:38] because there go I if it wasn't for God
[1:24:41] opening my eyes. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:45] I don't look down at someone whose eyes
[1:24:47] haven't been opened. But I say, "Father,
[1:24:50] my eyes have been opened. Therefore, I
[1:24:53] rejoice because I am so undeserving."
[1:25:00] Praise the Lord. So, it's God that
[1:25:02] closes and it's God that opens. Matthew
[1:25:05] 11:26 and 20 25- 26. At that time Jesus
[1:25:10] answered and said, "I thank thee, oh
[1:25:11] father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[1:25:13] because thou hast hid these things. Thou
[1:25:16] hast hid these things from the wise and
[1:25:19] prudent and hast revealed them onto
[1:25:21] babes. Even so,
[1:25:25] Father, for so it seemed good in thy
[1:25:30] sight." If it's good for the Father,
[1:25:33] it's good for me. Amen. That's right. No
[1:25:35] matter what my carnal man thinks about
[1:25:37] it, no matter of of the unfairness that
[1:25:41] I might think within myself, if it's
[1:25:43] good to the father to close the eyes of
[1:25:45] one, it's good for me. If it's good for
[1:25:47] the father to open the eyes of one, it's
[1:25:49] good for me. I'm just glad that I'm on
[1:25:52] the right side.
[1:25:55] So, within the scripture, we can see
[1:25:57] that there is a a generation of Jesus
[1:26:00] Christ. I'm I'm sure you've all read
[1:26:02] that scripture. It's a generation of
[1:26:05] Jesus Christ and there's a generation of
[1:26:08] vipers. So, we see that from the Garden
[1:26:12] of Eden up until the very time that
[1:26:14] we're living now, there's there's two
[1:26:16] seeds that's that's been intermingled
[1:26:18] and and throughout the the uh throughout
[1:26:21] history and since time began of a
[1:26:23] generation of vipers and of a generation
[1:26:26] of Jesus Christ. And sometimes they
[1:26:29] cross paths and they intertwine with one
[1:26:31] another. And sometimes they can get so
[1:26:34] close
[1:26:35] that it would deceive the very elected
[1:26:38] if possible.
[1:26:40] Because it is a religious spirit. True.
[1:26:44] Interesting. It's not the person out
[1:26:45] there that that that that that's walking
[1:26:47] around and wants to has a chip on his
[1:26:49] shoulder and just wants to hurt people
[1:26:51] and do bad things. You're like, "Yeah,
[1:26:53] unless God gets a hold of that person's
[1:26:55] life, I can see the fruits of his life."
[1:26:59] But when it's a religious spirit and
[1:27:02] it's hidden and it's
[1:27:04] intertwined, that's the spirit that we
[1:27:06] have to be careful of.
[1:27:11] I'll just be honest with you. I don't
[1:27:13] want no dealings with religious people.
[1:27:16] I don't care if they're in the message
[1:27:18] or not
[1:27:20] because a religious spirit is it's a
[1:27:22] it's a fornicating, unclean, ungodly
[1:27:26] spirit that's hidden behind
[1:27:29] religion
[1:27:31] and it bring forth it brings forth a
[1:27:34] life hidden behind religion
[1:27:38] and that person might be a son or
[1:27:40] daughter of God but yet they have given
[1:27:43] themselves over to something. It's a
[1:27:46] religious something and before you know
[1:27:48] it you begin to see the fruits of this
[1:27:51] of this of this person's life being
[1:27:53] manifested before you. Yeah. From what I
[1:27:56] have
[1:27:57] seen, you want to know how you can tell
[1:28:00] of a real religious person? A religious
[1:28:02] person cannot take correction. That's
[1:28:04] true.
[1:28:06] And a religious person cannot say sorry
[1:28:10] because they're religious and they are
[1:28:12] self-righteous within themselves. They
[1:28:14] think they're better. Therefore, they
[1:28:16] cannot humble themselves when they're
[1:28:18] wrong and come and say, "Sorry for what
[1:28:21] I have done and what I have said and my
[1:28:23] actions towards you." Why? because
[1:28:25] they're religious. Now, take a person
[1:28:28] then, a son or daughter of God from from
[1:28:30] the same father. This is amazing. And
[1:28:33] perhaps they may not seem as spiritual
[1:28:36] as these others, right? But yet they can
[1:28:40] take correction,
[1:28:42] and yet they can humble themselves and
[1:28:44] say, "Sorry." You see the difference?
[1:28:47] It's the teachable spirit within the
[1:28:49] person. That's the difference between
[1:28:51] religion and relationship.
[1:28:54] Yeah.
[1:28:56] Yeah. That's good. You just rather not
[1:28:59] deal with it. Just Just give me people
[1:29:01] who are in a relationship with God. Let
[1:29:03] them be my friends. That'd be good,
[1:29:06] wouldn't it?
[1:29:08] Yeah. Lord, help us. Huh? Yes. We need
[1:29:11] help. Lord, help us. Because we're
[1:29:13] talking about the eye, the gateway to
[1:29:16] the soul. You know how easy it is for
[1:29:18] one of us to become religious?
[1:29:21] Huh? You know how easy it is where where
[1:29:23] you just uh where you could just take
[1:29:25] yourself off and and you could just take
[1:29:28] yourself off and just hide over here and
[1:29:30] sit all by yourself and sing hymns and
[1:29:34] sing songs or whatever and yet you're
[1:29:36] not friendly with anybody.
[1:29:39] You don't reach out. You're in your own
[1:29:40] little bubble. Yeah. Huh? You know how
[1:29:43] easy it is to take on a religious
[1:29:45] spirit?
[1:29:47] Especially if you're intelligent.
[1:29:50] True. All of you intelligent people
[1:29:52] here, be careful. True. Be careful
[1:29:56] because through reasonings and
[1:29:58] intellects,
[1:30:00] religious spirits can take over our
[1:30:02] lives without us even knowing it. That's
[1:30:05] the truth.
[1:30:07] Discern yourself. Amen.
[1:30:13] Now going back to our opening
[1:30:16] scripture, we see that Cleopus and his
[1:30:19] friend, they were walking from Jerusalem
[1:30:21] to a village called Emmas and and they
[1:30:24] were just talking to one another about
[1:30:26] the things that had just transpired and
[1:30:28] the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. And as
[1:30:31] we read, we saw that Jesus drew near and
[1:30:34] and brother Brandham takes this this
[1:30:36] little ex excerpt of the scriptures
[1:30:38] there. And he says, you know, they were
[1:30:40] talking about Jesus and therefore he
[1:30:42] came around. And he says that whenever
[1:30:45] you begin to talk about the Lord, the
[1:30:47] Lord's presence comes around. That's why
[1:30:49] when we come to church, we can feel the
[1:30:52] presence of God and and we know he's
[1:30:54] there. Why? Because we're talking about
[1:30:55] God. And so I think that it needs to go
[1:30:58] just not only on a Wednesday and a
[1:31:00] Sunday, but our conversation. We need to
[1:31:03] be trying to fellowship one with one
[1:31:05] another more on the Lord, more on the
[1:31:08] word, more in what God has done in this
[1:31:10] day, more of what God has done in our
[1:31:13] lives. And when we do that, God will
[1:31:15] come by and join himself with us. Too
[1:31:19] much of the time, we are just so carnal
[1:31:22] and we're talking about carnal things.
[1:31:24] Amen. Do you know why we do that? We
[1:31:27] everybody you know why? Because we're
[1:31:30] carnal by first nature. Yeah.
[1:31:32] Comfortable. It's so easy.
[1:31:36] Did you see this? Yeah. Did you see
[1:31:37] Cam's Gataboo? Yeah. I saw Yeah. He got
[1:31:40] signed. Yes. Woohoo. You know, New York
[1:31:43] Giants.
[1:31:44] Yes. Arizona boy. And we get all caught
[1:31:47] up with our Arizona boys in sports. And
[1:31:49] we get caught up with this and we get
[1:31:51] caught up with that. And instead of
[1:31:53] getting caught up with the word,
[1:31:57] when we get caught up with the word in
[1:31:59] fellowship, it brings God in our midst.
[1:32:07] So, one of the things that I noticed
[1:32:08] about this this passage of scripture is
[1:32:12] that these two men, Cleopus and his
[1:32:15] friend, they were they were
[1:32:18] disappointed. And um I could see that
[1:32:21] they were they were they were so
[1:32:22] disappointed that they didn't even
[1:32:24] believe the testimony of the women. And
[1:32:27] they didn't even believe that when they
[1:32:29] heard the testimony of the men that the
[1:32:31] grave was empty, they thought, "Yeah,
[1:32:33] yeah, okay." They still didn't believe
[1:32:36] it. You say, "Brother Stephen, how do
[1:32:38] you know they still didn't believe it?"
[1:32:40] Well, if the tomb was empty and he had
[1:32:42] risen, they would have stayed in
[1:32:44] Jerusalem. Why were they leaving
[1:32:46] Jerusalem to go to Emmas?
[1:32:49] The Bible said that they were sad. They
[1:32:52] were disappointed. Watch this. The the
[1:32:55] uh the scripture there verse verse 21 of
[1:32:58] of Luke 24 says, "But we trusted. We
[1:33:02] trusted. This is what we believed. We we
[1:33:04] trusted that it had been him which
[1:33:07] should have redeemed Israel." Beside all
[1:33:09] this, today is the third day since these
[1:33:11] things were done.
[1:33:13] the redemption of Israel and the freeing
[1:33:16] freeing them from the bondage of Rome.
[1:33:19] It didn't happen as they thought it
[1:33:21] should have happened.
[1:33:23] They thought the Messiah was going to
[1:33:25] come and and he was going to come and
[1:33:27] break their bondage and he was going to
[1:33:28] come and set the captives free, which he
[1:33:30] did. And he was going to come and he was
[1:33:33] going to do away with this with with
[1:33:34] these Romans and these different ones
[1:33:36] that had the rule and authority over
[1:33:38] them. And they thought, my when the
[1:33:39] Messiah comes, it'll just be one great
[1:33:42] millennium and we won't have any
[1:33:44] pressures and we won't have people uh
[1:33:46] overlording us and all. Wow. When he
[1:33:48] comes, what a day it's going to be.
[1:33:51] Yeah. And we thought it was him. I was
[1:33:54] sure of it. I was positive. He was the
[1:33:58] one. I seen his life. I seen what he
[1:34:01] did. I seen the mighty miracles. I It
[1:34:04] was amazing. He was a man used of God
[1:34:07] and mighty in works before God and
[1:34:09] before the people. He opened blinded
[1:34:12] eyes. He healed the sick. He He brought
[1:34:14] people back to life again who were dead.
[1:34:16] Surely, we haven't had a prophet like
[1:34:18] this. And for 400 plus years, we've
[1:34:21] never seen anything like this. He's the
[1:34:23] one. They were so excited. They spent
[1:34:26] three and a half years with him. They
[1:34:27] slept with him. They ate with him. They
[1:34:29] fellowshipped with him. They heard his
[1:34:31] sermons. They were so close to him. They
[1:34:33] knew that that was him.
[1:34:36] But yet he died.
[1:34:39] How could this happen? They I I watched
[1:34:42] it. I I saw them beat him. I I saw I saw
[1:34:46] He was whipped. He was punched. They
[1:34:48] spat on
[1:34:49] him. I saw him. I saw I saw him nailed
[1:34:52] him to the cross. They hung him up. It
[1:34:56] was It was such a a day of of remorse.
[1:35:01] There was there was three hours. It was
[1:35:03] midnight in the middle of the day. There
[1:35:05] was an earthquake.
[1:35:07] There was mighty things that happened on
[1:35:09] that day and and that was
[1:35:11] him. But I guess it's not him.
[1:35:16] Oh, what do we do now? I thought this
[1:35:18] was true. Hey, I've lived the last three
[1:35:22] and a half years of my life following
[1:35:24] this guy. I've been in the message for
[1:35:26] so long.
[1:35:28] I' I've following the tapes.
[1:35:31] I I' I've heard the testimonies, but I
[1:35:34] don't know if I believe. I might as
[1:35:36] well. It's just might as well just go
[1:35:38] back to Emmas.
[1:35:41] I Let's go. Come on. Misery loves
[1:35:44] company. Cleopus got his friend. Let's
[1:35:48] go. Yeah. Yeah. He He rose.
[1:35:51] Yeah. Sure he did. Yeah. Her with her
[1:35:56] testimony. I don't believe that. The
[1:35:58] guys, they're just saying that to make
[1:36:00] everybody happy. They were disappointed.
[1:36:05] Have you ever been disappointed in life?
[1:36:07] Yeah. Have you ever been disappointed
[1:36:09] with your wife, with your husband, with
[1:36:12] your kids, with the church? You ever
[1:36:14] been disappointed with yourself? You
[1:36:17] ever been disappointed with the
[1:36:18] preacher? Yeah. We'll all disappoint
[1:36:21] each other at one time or another, but
[1:36:24] God will never disappoint us. Thank you,
[1:36:27] Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:30] They were so disappointed that it caused
[1:36:32] their faith to go to extreme low levels.
[1:36:37] That they couldn't believe the testimony
[1:36:39] of others.
[1:36:42] Watch what brother Brandham said in the
[1:36:44] sermon Luke. I love this. Be
[1:36:47] persistent. Like the little Saraphician
[1:36:50] woman. No matter how many
[1:36:52] disappointments she had as she come
[1:36:53] down, she still had focused herself on
[1:36:56] that that was God. And she come to him
[1:37:00] and got what she asked for because she
[1:37:03] had her focus right. She had it no
[1:37:05] matter how many puffs of wind come
[1:37:07] saying days of miracles are passed. Your
[1:37:09] husband will leave you. That didn't
[1:37:10] matter her a bit that her that bullet
[1:37:13] went straight to its point. Amen. He's
[1:37:15] saying focus on the right things.
[1:37:20] We're all going to be disappointed in
[1:37:22] one another and family members and
[1:37:24] church members and the preacher and the
[1:37:26] deacons, the song leader, whatever it
[1:37:28] may be. Disappointments are going to
[1:37:31] come, but know that the word is the word
[1:37:34] and keep our focus on the word of God.
[1:37:36] You say, "Brother Stephen, I've been
[1:37:38] prayed for and I'm still not sick." Keep
[1:37:40] your focus on the word. It doesn't
[1:37:43] matter how long it takes, God will
[1:37:45] fulfill his word. You say, "Brother
[1:37:48] Steve, and my family members, these
[1:37:49] situations, just hold on. Be patient and
[1:37:53] stay focused on the promises of God."
[1:37:56] That's it.
[1:37:58] But that's your decision. That's my
[1:38:01] decision.
[1:38:02] We have to have the right attitude
[1:38:06] towards the promises of God. Amen. And
[1:38:09] that will bring it to pass in our lives.
[1:38:11] You believe Brother Brandham said that?
[1:38:13] He said it. Therefore, it's true.
[1:38:15] Therefore, I believe it. Now, we have to
[1:38:18] apply it.
[1:38:23] That's the hard part.
[1:38:26] That when we're
[1:38:27] disappointed, that the word didn't bring
[1:38:30] my deliverance in service, that the word
[1:38:33] didn't bring my healing, that the word
[1:38:35] didn't bring this, we get so
[1:38:37] disappointed. Though we pray and we fast
[1:38:39] and we ask God and we seek God and we're
[1:38:42] sincere in our hearts, we get
[1:38:43] disappointed. Yeah, but the reason they
[1:38:47] were disappointed is because of this.
[1:38:50] It's because they were expecting it to
[1:38:52] come to pass in a different way. So when
[1:38:56] they were expecting it one way and it
[1:38:58] didn't happen, it brought a
[1:38:59] disappointment in their lives. That's
[1:39:01] what happens with you and I, especially
[1:39:04] towards God. Yeah, we get disappointed
[1:39:08] with God when it doesn't come to pass in
[1:39:11] our lives when we think it should and
[1:39:13] how we think it should. But if we will
[1:39:16] just hold on to the promises of God and
[1:39:20] say, "Lord, I believe your word. I'm
[1:39:22] going to focus on you until it happens.
[1:39:25] And whatever way it happens, it's going
[1:39:27] to happen. I'm all for that."
[1:39:29] That's how you miss you take away the
[1:39:32] disappointments with God is you don't
[1:39:34] expect it to be a certain time or a
[1:39:36] certain way or a certain season because
[1:39:39] all of that is up to God himself.
[1:39:44] Hallelujah. Stay patient and stay
[1:39:47] focused. Amen.
[1:39:50] So when Jesus drew near, the Bible says
[1:39:53] that their eyes were holden that they
[1:39:54] should not know him.
[1:39:56] But along the journey from from from
[1:39:59] from Jerusalem to Emmas, he began to
[1:40:02] preach to them. Now I want you to
[1:40:04] understand these guys were not
[1:40:06] unbelievers.
[1:40:08] They were believers. They followed him.
[1:40:10] They followed the word. They followed
[1:40:12] the message. They loved it. And they got
[1:40:15] a Sure, they got a little disappointed.
[1:40:16] So they were walking, but their eyes
[1:40:19] were were were holden that they would
[1:40:21] not know him. And I began to think about
[1:40:24] this and I thought, my when they heard
[1:40:26] his voice, cuz my sheep hear my voice
[1:40:29] and another they shall not follow. But
[1:40:32] when they heard his voice, how did they
[1:40:34] not know it was
[1:40:35] him? Because God shut their eyes.
[1:40:40] They couldn't see it even if they tried
[1:40:42] to see it because God now was going to
[1:40:45] do something in their life.
[1:40:48] So they were in church services from
[1:40:51] Jerusalem to
[1:40:53] Emmas and he was preaching to them
[1:40:55] starting with Moses and down through all
[1:40:57] through the prophets and he was saying
[1:40:59] everything that must come to pass and
[1:41:00] and and the crucifixion and how he must
[1:41:02] rise in the third day and so on and so
[1:41:04] forth and he was he was teaching them
[1:41:06] and preaching to them everything
[1:41:08] concerning himself.
[1:41:10] But he never come right out and say I am
[1:41:13] he. Don't you see me? Brother Brandham
[1:41:16] said, "That is for us to figure out on
[1:41:18] our own."
[1:41:23] So he began to preach to them and and
[1:41:26] and right up until the end time, right
[1:41:30] up until they got to Emmas uh at the
[1:41:33] evening time, they still didn't
[1:41:35] understand who he was. Yeah.
[1:41:39] Church service after church service
[1:41:41] after church service. They came to
[1:41:43] church from Jerusalem to Emmas and still
[1:41:46] they didn't understand who he was. Yet
[1:41:48] they were believers. Right? Yet they had
[1:41:50] a segene of God but they still didn't
[1:41:53] understand why because their eyes were
[1:41:56] holding.
[1:41:59] This is pretty interesting. So from
[1:42:02] Emmas to Jerusalem, from Jerusalem to
[1:42:05] Emmas, it's 7
[1:42:07] miles. From Jerusalem to Emmas and we
[1:42:11] see at the evening time is when they had
[1:42:13] gotten to their place of abode that they
[1:42:15] constrained him to come in and that's
[1:42:18] when he done something very familiar to
[1:42:20] them. He broke bread and their eyes came
[1:42:24] opened.
[1:42:26] It wasn't at the beginning of the
[1:42:27] journey. It wasn't at mile one. wasn't
[1:42:30] at
[1:42:31] Ephesus. It wasn't at mile 2. It wasn't
[1:42:34] at mile 3. It wasn't at Smyrna. It
[1:42:36] wasn't at Philadelphia. It wasn't at any
[1:42:38] of these other ages. Why? Because the
[1:42:41] time wasn't ready for their eyes to be
[1:42:43] opened yet. Because it's all the types
[1:42:46] and shadows of the scripture. They must
[1:42:48] connect together. They cannot be broken.
[1:42:51] So their eyes were not going to be open
[1:42:53] until they came to the seventh mile to
[1:42:56] the secret abode to that little house
[1:42:58] that when they would enter into that
[1:43:00] little house their eyes would be open.
[1:43:02] Then they would say, "Wow, that's him."
[1:43:05] Amen. How did we miss it? Through seven
[1:43:07] church ages, he's been preaching to us.
[1:43:09] Through seven church ages, he's been
[1:43:11] walking through the midst of the golden
[1:43:13] candlesticks. But in the last age, at
[1:43:16] the evening time in that little home, he
[1:43:20] revealed himself in a familiar way that
[1:43:23] they recognized who he was. Hallelujah.
[1:43:27] Why were their eyes opened? Because it
[1:43:30] was time for their eyes to be opened.
[1:43:34] It wasn't time in Smyrna. It wasn't time
[1:43:36] in Philadelphia, but it was time for the
[1:43:38] Leodysian church age that they would be
[1:43:41] full beneficiaries. full beneficiaries
[1:43:44] of a full opened word.
[1:43:50] Why did they go in? Why did he wait
[1:43:52] until they went into the little
[1:43:56] house? Why didn't he just Why didn't he
[1:43:59] share it along the
[1:44:00] way? Because this isn't an open
[1:44:02] ministry.
[1:44:04] This third pull is not a public show
[1:44:07] anymore. It's not for the bypassers to
[1:44:10] hear it and recognize it. It's not for
[1:44:12] the bypassers to understand it, but it's
[1:44:15] revealed in secret.
[1:44:19] Brother Brandham said, "Why do I why do
[1:44:22] I have to go in there?" Remember the
[1:44:25] tent vision? Why in that little room?
[1:44:28] Why do I have to go into that little
[1:44:30] place? He says, "Don't you know that the
[1:44:33] Bible says he?" Brother Brandham said,
[1:44:34] "Notice he the angel always takes me
[1:44:37] back to the scripture
[1:44:40] because the word will reveal the word."
[1:44:43] Amen. And so now he's why in there?
[1:44:46] Because the things that you do in
[1:44:48] secret, you shall be rewarded openly.
[1:44:52] And the angel told him, "This time it
[1:44:55] will not be a public show. Therefore, it
[1:45:00] is done in secret within the soul of
[1:45:04] man. It is not to do with the outside
[1:45:07] man anymore. That's not to do with the
[1:45:09] five senses of the man of the outer man
[1:45:11] and the inner man. But now it goes
[1:45:14] deeper within to the holiest of holies,
[1:45:16] the very shakina glory of God himself to
[1:45:19] the soul segene of God. And that's what
[1:45:23] gets regenerated. That's why you can see
[1:45:26] the word for this hour because there's a
[1:45:29] CG gene within your soul.
[1:45:32] Thank you, Lord. And so now through
[1:45:35] through through
[1:45:36] through,00 sermons as you begin to watch
[1:45:39] you you begin to think, "Wow, at the
[1:45:42] beginning you say, "Wow, what mighty
[1:45:44] miracles this is a true man of God and
[1:45:46] and and wow, this is amazing." And look
[1:45:49] at the things that he's doing and
[1:45:50] discerning of hearts and wow, this is
[1:45:53] awesome. But he takes you to a place
[1:45:57] where it's no longer the outer shell.
[1:46:01] He takes you to a place where it's no
[1:46:03] longer reasonings within our bodies, but
[1:46:06] now it's not an open show. And he takes
[1:46:08] you secretly individual as Gentiles into
[1:46:12] a secret place. He says, "Now this is
[1:46:16] the third pool. It's not far out there."
[1:46:20] What happened in that little room?
[1:46:22] People came in and they in wheelchairs
[1:46:25] and the crutches and stretchers and they
[1:46:27] came out and they were healed and there
[1:46:29] was lame. They came out. They were
[1:46:30] walking and and what happened in there?
[1:46:34] What happened in your life? You were
[1:46:37] once spiritually lame. You were once
[1:46:39] spiritually blind. What happened to you?
[1:46:41] I'll tell you what happened with you. He
[1:46:42] met God in that little secret place and
[1:46:45] he opened the eyes of your understanding
[1:46:48] and now you could see. Brother Brandon
[1:46:50] would turn his back and he would say,
[1:46:52] "Thus sayeth the Lord, I give you your
[1:46:54] last sign." As he turned his back to the
[1:46:57] tent of Abraham and Sarah, we can just
[1:46:59] see it through the scriptures. We begin
[1:47:01] to think, "Wow, it's opened. Look at
[1:47:04] that. I see it in the type. I see the
[1:47:06] shadow. That's the same God with Abraham
[1:47:09] as Melzdc as it's the same God." Now,
[1:47:14] what happens? Your eyes become open. You
[1:47:16] think, "Wow, this is amazing. This is
[1:47:20] wonderful."
[1:47:22] See, it disappears.
[1:47:25] How many times does God in your life, he
[1:47:27] shares something with you? He does
[1:47:29] something for you and it's very special
[1:47:31] and you have a special time with God and
[1:47:32] all of a sudden,
[1:47:37] where'd he go? I haven't felt him in
[1:47:40] years, but I still remember what he did
[1:47:42] for me. Yeah. Yeah. He did something
[1:47:44] special for me in that little place in
[1:47:46] there. Changed my life. I don't know
[1:47:48] what happened. I can't explain it. I
[1:47:51] just know that my desires that I once
[1:47:54] had are no longer the same.
[1:48:00] The only miracle that Jesus did after
[1:48:03] the resurrection was open blinded eyes.
[1:48:05] That's what this third pole ministry is
[1:48:07] all about. It's about opening our
[1:48:08] blinded eyes to the word for this day.
[1:48:13] The third pole ministry is a
[1:48:15] resurrection ministry. Jesus Christ the
[1:48:18] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:48:23] Amen. All of a sudden, man, they
[1:48:25] realized, "Wow, that was him.
[1:48:28] That was that was him. They were right.
[1:48:31] He has risen." All of a sudden, their
[1:48:33] faith builds to a place and they begin
[1:48:35] to say to each other, "Wow, did not our
[1:48:37] hearts burn within us." They were they
[1:48:39] were sad at one point, but afterwards
[1:48:41] now they're saying, "Wow, I I yeah, I
[1:48:44] knew it was him all along." No, you
[1:48:45] didn't,
[1:48:47] Cleopus. Your eyes were shut just as
[1:48:49] much as mine were shut. But but my heart
[1:48:52] burned within me. It did. And I said,
[1:48:55] "Wow, Cleopus, so did mine. I There's
[1:48:57] something within me. I I don't know what
[1:48:59] it was, but it was familiar. But I
[1:49:01] didn't know who he was. But now that I
[1:49:03] know that I know I know not that I can
[1:49:07] see the picture within the picture,
[1:49:09] that's all I can see. It was him. Amen.
[1:49:12] Hallelujah.
[1:49:14] So, it's pretty this is this amazes me.
[1:49:17] They didn't just sit in the little house
[1:49:20] and talk to each other and and just keep
[1:49:23] it that us two and no more. Maybe we're
[1:49:26] special. He He came to us and he didn't
[1:49:29] go to anybody else. No, they it was in
[1:49:32] the evening time. So what did they do?
[1:49:35] They turned from Emmas and they went
[1:49:37] right back to Jerusalem
[1:49:40] at night time. Yeah. At a time where
[1:49:42] there's thieves and robbers and animals
[1:49:45] and different things that could attack
[1:49:46] them. I They had no flashlights. They
[1:49:50] had no phones. There's no street lights,
[1:49:53] electricity. It was dark. Maybe it was a
[1:49:55] I don't know if it was a full moon or
[1:49:57] not, but it was dark outside, but they
[1:49:59] didn't fear the darkness when the word
[1:50:02] was revealed to them.
[1:50:06] They weren't scared of what might happen
[1:50:08] when they went back to Emmas or back to
[1:50:10] Jerusalem. No, they didn't fear the
[1:50:12] darkness. They didn't fear the darkness
[1:50:14] of Lady Osia. No, they were like, "Hey,
[1:50:16] something's happened. We've met Jesus. I
[1:50:19] know he's coming. I've seen the word.
[1:50:21] I'm going to walk in the darkness of Le
[1:50:23] Oysia because now I am the light.
[1:50:27] I have nothing to fear of what happens
[1:50:29] and what doesn't happen. Why? Because I
[1:50:32] know I've met him and there's nothing to
[1:50:34] fear in this earth. That's all that
[1:50:36] matters. Well, what about this and what
[1:50:39] about that? Well, what about it? What if
[1:50:41] it never happens? What if God comes and
[1:50:43] changes our body? Hallelujah.
[1:50:46] Hallelujah. I'm ready. Amen. There was
[1:50:50] darkness all around them, but they
[1:50:52] didn't fear. Why? Because now they had
[1:50:56] they had something to do now. Yeah. You
[1:50:59] know what was happening? There was two
[1:51:00] messengers now that were going back to
[1:51:02] Jerusalem.
[1:51:07] There was a Moses and an Elijah that are
[1:51:10] going back to Jerusalem. Why? Because
[1:51:12] now that this this Leodysian church age
[1:51:16] will be over with after the after the
[1:51:18] ministry is done, after the last person
[1:51:20] takes their position in the body and God
[1:51:22] comes and catches us up in the air.
[1:51:24] Guess what? Now there's two messengers
[1:51:26] that return. They go from Emmas. They
[1:51:29] return back to Jerusalem. Why? Because
[1:51:31] they have a message. It is him. It was
[1:51:34] him. He was the Messiah. It was true.
[1:51:37] The testimony was right. Hallelujah.
[1:51:41] Amen.
[1:51:43] Luke 24:45 as the musicians come
[1:51:48] and opened he who opened their
[1:51:51] understanding.
[1:51:52] He did. He their understanding that they
[1:51:56] might understand the scriptures.
[1:51:59] Understand it is God that opened your
[1:52:02] eyes. Therefore, it's God that has to
[1:52:05] open your children's eyes. It's God that
[1:52:07] has to open your family's eyes. You
[1:52:09] cannot do it. So don't worry about it.
[1:52:12] Just leave it in the hands of God and
[1:52:14] let him do his thing.
[1:52:22] When their eyes were
[1:52:24] opened, they saw him.
[1:52:31] Wow. Their hearts burned within them.
[1:52:35] Yeah. There's something about this. I
[1:52:37] don't know what it is. My if my eyes are
[1:52:40] holding, but I know there's something.
[1:52:42] If that's you this morning in regards to
[1:52:45] this message, hey, just because you
[1:52:47] don't understand it, don't turn away. If
[1:52:50] you got a desire to serve God, just keep
[1:52:52] serving God. Don't turn and walk away to
[1:52:55] Emmas. No. No. Stay in Jerusalem.
[1:52:58] Because that's where the first
[1:52:59] resurrection was going to be. That's
[1:53:01] where they should have been staying was
[1:53:02] at
[1:53:04] Jerusalem. Stay in Jerusalem. the holy
[1:53:07] city. Stay in the presence of God. Stay
[1:53:10] in the word. Now is not a time to turn
[1:53:12] back and walk away just because you
[1:53:14] don't understand it. There will come a
[1:53:17] day, Amen. where God will take the eyes
[1:53:22] that were once holding from who he is
[1:53:25] and he'll take the scales away with the
[1:53:28] eyes of the Holy Spirit. And all of a
[1:53:31] sudden, you'll go, "Wow, all these years
[1:53:34] I've been here listening to these
[1:53:36] sermons, listening to these tapes. Now I
[1:53:39] know when I look at it, it's him."
[1:53:47] What do you see when you look at this
[1:53:49] message? Yeah.
[1:53:52] What do you see when you read a sermon
[1:53:55] or listen to it or follow along and you
[1:53:57] see the the the doctrines that he
[1:54:00] teaches? Do you see a
[1:54:01] man or do you see him?
[1:54:06] I know what I see. When I read the
[1:54:10] longer that I've been serving God, the
[1:54:13] little by little that he reveals himself
[1:54:15] to me. I'm a slow starter and that's
[1:54:19] okay. I I'm slow at everything and my
[1:54:23] wife can she can tell you and that's
[1:54:25] just fine. Amen. I am who I am. But
[1:54:29] little by little, he's revealing himself
[1:54:32] to me. Step by step, sermon by sermon,
[1:54:35] Wednesday night by Wednesday night,
[1:54:36] Sunday by Sunday, he's adding a little
[1:54:39] bit here and a little bit there. And I'm
[1:54:41] starting to catch the big picture that
[1:54:44] this message, it's not the message of a
[1:54:47] man, but it's Christ. The mystery of God
[1:54:52] revealed before our very eyes.
[1:54:56] Hallelujah. Let's stand together.

[2:14:53] Heavenly

[2:14:56] this time of gathering, Lord, this
[2:15:00] service. Lord,
[2:15:02] and we may depart this place, but oh
[2:15:06] God, may we be as those that left that
[2:15:09] little house as we heard of this
[2:15:11] morning, that had open eyes, that had
[2:15:14] something to run back to Jerusalem with.
[2:15:19] Lord, the despair had been turned into
[2:15:21] rejoicing.
[2:15:23] The sadness had been turned into hope.
[2:15:26] And Lord, we know and we're so thankful
[2:15:28] for that hope this morning.
[2:15:31] Lord, may we seek for that as we, as I
[2:15:34] was just reading with my boys in
[2:15:35] Proverbs the 2 chapter. Lord, how to
[2:15:39] seek for these things as those that seek
[2:15:41] for silver. Lord, we run after our
[2:15:45] ambitions, Lord, our careers and things.
[2:15:48] Lord, we put so much effort into that.
[2:15:50] But Lord, may we leave this place this
[2:15:52] morning and put our efforts in the hope
[2:15:54] that you have given us and that we've
[2:15:56] heard about today. We thank you for this
[2:15:58] time. Be with each and every one. Lord,
[2:16:01] may your presence and your angels be
[2:16:02] with us and protect us on the road and
[2:16:04] highways, Lord, and the evil would come
[2:16:07] at us. I pray in Jesus name. Amen.
