praise that we could give he is so worthy this evening you're happy to be a Christian you love the Lord praise the Lord we certainly count it an honor and privilege to be in the house of God this evening amen don't take it lightly friends that's right that's true don't take it lightly that's true as the great day approaches it should be at the top of our priority list is to come into the house of God if you have your Bibles let's turn into to the Book of Genesis and before I get started um being one who helps with Camp I know it's been a week and a half since we've had camp but as one that helps with Camp I I certainly want to uh say thank you first to our pastor for a vision of having camp for the young people it's been 14 years and serving and all that he does in that vision for without a vision the people perish right and we have a vision for the Next Generation that comes up under us and we want to thank the youth leaders those that they're the core group that are in charge of putting games Brother Justin sister Jen and um my wife and sister Hannah they had the hit of camp and they put on a coffee bar and uh sister Ashlin there's one that you know behind the scenes in every Camp it always happens there's one that always works a little bit more Works a little bit harder more respons responsibility and there's things that you know it just doesn't go as planned you have ones that back out and ones that want to come and different things and even going up to camp we had a cabin right at the last minute we were in PAC and they call us and say this one's off so 14 people we got to have space for 14 other people and and two counselors you know it's just a headache but yet she works so hard on that and she does a lot of the preparation so we certainly want to say thank you to her and to our camp nurse and uh I do want to say thank you to my mom for driving the bus how many of that was a blessing all the parents that didn't have to drive up there what a blessing that was and she does it out you know she just wants to do it as a servant and we just ask the Lord would bless her and all the counselors that helped us and I have a couple of pictures because you know I believe that you know in the mission field and going out I I believe that there's a call and you know if the Lord opens the door for us to do it but I believe that the young people there's a mission field within our own homes and right amongst us and as young people it is a priority that we put them first so if we can show just a couple of photos here we have our camp nurse go ahead brother Ethan we had the group photo that was the hit we might have to open one up out here in the coffee that's some of the other counselors brother Matt brother Burley were our guest speakers these brothers had a hard time counseling all the paintball group brother Ron and brother berley there that was the camp there and then go ahead and I have one video and a couple of pictures of the baptism so this was the setting here can we get it unmuted if not that's okay okay it's just a 30 second clip here and go ahead and show the pictures I believe this is Brother uh Jonathan here I'm not mistaken and then brother I forget his name I have it right here and I don't want to mess that up aimu is that right but the reason we show these things is because there's a lot of you that have have contributed into this effort ones have come unto me and said brother James I'd like to pay somebody's way I'd like to donate I'd like to give but maybe that offering that you gave maybe it was one of these boys maybe it was something that God did he changed one of these lives here at camp because I believe it's a mission fill within itself I believe it's a great priority that we must place on the young people because let me just share this one little part I had a counselor come to me and they said brother James you know it was It was kind of sad we were sitting around and I'm just going to be vague with it but there was within my own dorm there was four to six out of probably 10 to 12 that are in a counselor's dorm between four and six come from a broken home that are struggling with something come from a broken home and you know the sad part about it Saint homes within the message how rampant is this going on right now that Satan's coming and seeking whom he may devour if you believe this message is true and you want to serve God with all you got guess what he's coming for you and if he can't get you he's going to go after your wife and he can't get your wife he's going to go after your kids if he can't get your kids he's going to go after your health yes sir that's the importance of having these meetings yes so we certainly want to thank all those that were involved and those that gave and we just thank the Lord for what he did amen that if one Soul gives their life to God it's all worth it it's all worth it let's just bow our heads and our hearts our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we humble ourselves in your presence once again Lord sometimes we feel inadequate and unable but father it's not our own ability that we're lending on but we're trusting in you that you would come and that you would break the bread of life to us that you would open our eyes of understanding that you would give us a word in due season father and we're just asking that you would Minister to hearts that you would Lord change lives and as the word Goes Forth may it have an effect upon the people for what good is it to just Minister words and it was good to be in the house of God and it doesn't have an effect it doesn't drop into the soul father May the word fall into good ground that it might bring forth life and so father as we humble ourselves take our inabilities and make them your ability this evening I pray you be with the people be with those that couldn't be with us father I'm reminded I'm just asking a special blessing upon brother Matt Aon and his family they lost his father this Sunday father may you go and Lord may you be that tender hand oh God may you just comfort him through this this hard time and as the funeral approaches oh God may you just touch him in a special way him and all the family we commit this service into thy hands For Your Glory in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord Genesis 1:1 we're going to kind of pick up a little thought from the last time I don't want to repeat but it's something that God's been dealing with me Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God did divided the light from Darkness now let's skip down to verse 14 and it says and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs for seasons for days and for years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so and God made two great lights the Great light to Rule the Day and the Lesser night to rule the night and he made the Stars also and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from darkness and God saw that it was good you see this word rule I begin to look in this now he gave him rulership over the day and over the night and this word rule means involves the force of exercising power to exercise control or influence to exercise Authority or power to be preeminent or dominant to govern the movements of the things you can be seated this evening now before we get started here grandpa had sent a an email late last night when I was studying and it went so perfectly here so I'm just going to input this in from him and God made the world he might he might have been a 100 trillion years making it I don't know how long it was but he made it he didn't say how long it was it's none of our business how long it was that's pretty plain it's none of our business we only believe it amen and he said in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period that settles it and I believe that in it there that everything on Earth reflects the heavens everything on Earth reflects the heavens I believe that because that you see everything struggling for life is because that there is a life that is reflected from and I believe that when God made the man he started reflecting smaller things such as animal life and then the next things he cre created was something different that's exactly the way the Bible says he did he made the first things trees and boty life he made man and then the last thing that ever come up from the earth in the form of creation was man nothing higher ever come because why it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven which was God God is a man see God is is a man and so therefore it proves when God came down to dwell amongst us he was man and a man is so in that form that form of perfection of evolution of God which is man amen amen that's something so powerful because the highest form that was ever created from the Earth was man God desired to come down and to be you and I he didn't desire we're going to get into it here he didn't desire to be an angel he said I'm going to go pass the angels and I'm going to drop down to where man dwells because I want to know what you feel I want to know the heartaches I want to know the things you struggle with why would he send you through something that he hasn't already been Paul says in Corinthians for we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also B bear the image of the Heavenly so this evening I would like to speak on the ministry of the Moon the ministry of the Moon and I was going to put the Lesser light but I you know the ministry of the moon is very Frank it's very forward you should know what the the Moon represents and that is the bride so if you want to put the ministry of the Bride the ministry of the Moon the ministry of yourself whatever it is make sure that's you and as a subject true reflection true reflection so we see here in Genesis 1 and16 that was there was two great lights they had rulership over the day and over the night in Genesis 1 and3 and God said let there be light and there was light so we know that that that was the Vindicated word for that day that if God said let there be light and light didn't come then we would have a problem if God said let there be light and nothing happened it wouldn't be the Vindicated word that's right but yet as God began to speak and now God from the very beginning brother Brandon would begin to tell us that God had nothing to work with but his word he had nothing to work with but his word so as he began to walk through the Earth and he began to speak things begin to happen things begin to come forth us as human beings whenever we get into a place that we want to go build something or let's say this Pulpit was built you can't just speak it you got to go get your tools you got to go get a drill you got to get some screws you got to get all these materialistic things in order to build this Pulpit but God only had his word so from the beginning God only had his word and as it began to speak things begin to take action things begin to take form in Isaiah 55 And1 says so shall my word be that goeth out for forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please it shall prosper in the things where unto I send it you see from the very beginning when God began to speak what was it doing it was accomplishing the very thing that it was intended for that's right when he began to speak botney life and he begin to place the planets up in the world and he began to say let there be light and let let there be lights in the firmament Let There Be day and night and he separated the darkness what was he doing what was that word going out for a purpose what was happening it was that Vindicated word and it was going out to accomplish that what it was intended for and it's no different today what is happening tonight as a minister would begin to speak as the word is going forward down Through the Ages as that word is coming into manifestation what is happening the word is being expressed even as it was in the beginning and this Earth your your Earth and vessels this word is going forth and it was forming you it is controlling you is it is making you come into realization of what God is doing by his word what is it doing the word is going forth and it is having an effect amen sir and it is accomplishing that which would it was sent for to them that are in leoda to him that overcometh listen it's just not words on a paper it's not just something written down 2,000 years ago to him that believeth what is it that is a prophecy that is something written down that is a indicated word for this day what is it it's coming into manifestation my goodness sir if you have your Bibles let's turn to Colossians a little lengthy reading but I feel to read this portion of scripture Colossians 1 and verse2 it says give thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light how many's thankful to be partakers of The Inheritance though we only have our Earnest of The Inheritance there's an inheritance is coming and you better make sure that you claim your inheritance who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and ha translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through the his blood even the forgiveness of sin who in the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones and dominions principalities and Powers all things were created by Him and for him listen everything under Heaven and Earth was created by Him and for his glory it don't matter the principalities the powers the the Nations around the world Listen it don't matter who's in office whether it be Cala whether it be Donald Trump listen all this is going going to come to pass the way God wants it to come to pass prophecy is being fulfilled nothing can change it nothing can change the direction of America it's not going to get better it's going to get worse but everything was created by Him and for him and yet when San he came down and Satan wanted to tent him in the desert what was it what did he say all these kingdoms I will give unto you here Satan thought he owned all these kingdoms and he had power over all these kingdoms yet he didn't own one of them it's all according to God's plan and purpose and he is before all things and by him all things consist and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your own mind by Wicked Works yet hath he he reconciled you were alienated enemies within what your own mind where is the greatest battle ever fought in the mind your enemy isn't your wife it isn't your husband it isn't your kids the enemy is right here right in your own mind that's where Satan's Battleground is that's where he's going to fight you that's where he's going to try to deceive you that's right in the body of his flesh through death to present you a holy to present you holy and unblamable unreprovable in his sight verse 25 wherefore I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God listen what Paul says even the Mysteries which have been hid from ages and from Generations but now somebody say but now but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what the riches of the glory of the Mysteries among the Gentiles which is Christ in you it's not Christ in a pastor it's not Christ in a man or a prophet though there it's there but it's not Christ in somebody else sometimes it's hard to see it's Christ in you it don't matter your age there's no age limit yes it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen whom we preach warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus how are you going to get per how are you going to get Perfection how are you going to achieve Perfection though it seems impossible what does he say we're going to preach unto you and we're going to teach unto you why is it so important to come to the house of God that's it to hear the word of of God come and have an effect in our in our lives now is the time to correct this is a house of judgment a correction you see the Paul is dealing talking about the G dispensation here and we know it's the dispensation of the Gentiles but we know that the the Gentile dispensation is soon up it's blending time we you're seeing prophecies being fulfilled we're seeing things coming to pass at a rapid Pace this world is getting darker and darker as the as time goes on it's getting worse and worse in this dispensation we know is happening and it's going to turn from the Gentiles back into the Jews what is it brother Brandon would talk about the rising of the sun and it started in the East and then it sets in the west and there's only one thing for the sun to do again and what is is that go back into the W or east again he's turning back to them Jews Mysteries hidden from ages to ages you see as time goes on and we touch this in the first the service there but I want to resay this is that as we use the example of turning off the light and we turn it on again and God would send a messenger for every age but there there was only a lot there was only so much of word that he would given to that messenger so what will those that have come down Through the Ages what will they be judged by by what they know God would be unjust if he began to judge the ones that started in the first age by the open revealed book that we have now but as God moved on he began to evolve he began to pour out he begin to open up he began to show more and give more Revelation on more Revelation and you begin to understand that they can only be judged for what they know so whether it be the Reformation of Luther and justification they could only be judged by what they know how much was shown unto them and they get unto sanctification but yet now we have justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now it's coming to our day where are we at now what is our excuse what is our excuse we have 1100 sermons of the prophet and he began to open the book he began to break the Seven Seals he begin to show us this is your day this is your hour hallelujah what is our excuse what will we be judged by what will we be judged by we'll definitely be judged a whole lot more because we have the open book you see if God can or Satan can get you to stop at just justification and sanctification if he can get you to stop there or even the baptism of the Holy Ghost because let me tell you you have to go on to the New Birth go on and receive the Holy Ghost because those that were baptized listen baptism is just a outward work of it or outward showing of an inward work but baptizing it don't change you I was 12 years old whenever I got baptized I gave my heart I was sincere honest I was I gave my heart to God but yet as I went through high school I wasn't doing things that I should have I wasn't living right and doing those things that I should have that a son or a daughter of God that after you get that New Birth you have that experience let me tell you you don't do those things no more more you don't have those desires no more that's why you must go on with your Christian walk we all have a Ministry in this ministry of the Moon whether it be you know many people want to put this ministry as just the preachers but this ministry goes on for to to so much more amen whether it be preachers or song leaders musicians maybe somebody an elder in the church the the Bible gives us us instructions to help guide the younger ones so whether you be a father a a wife a young person no matter who it is we all have a Ministry within ourselves we all have a part to play listen to what brother brandham says here about every age he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches of each age in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says if you are a Christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that's it the word of this age every Messenger to every age will preach that word every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age The Cry of every age is to rebuke you have left the word of God repent and come back to the word from the first B book in the Bible Genesis to the last book Revelations there is only one reason for God's displeasure and that is leaving the word and there is only one remedy to gain his favor there is only one remedy to gain his favor and that is to go back to the word and so no matter how far you get away from the word listen you might be a fallen son and you might be sitting at home even watching this service I don't know who it is but let me tell you get back to the word of God that's the only remedy who cares what everybody else thinks who cares what your neighbors will say listen get back to your position that's the only remedy truth get back to the word of God in the Ephesian age and in this age in every Age We contemplate we'll see that is true in the last age which is our age we find that the blackout of the word the complete apostasy ending in a Great Tribulation if you are true seed if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you esteem this before anything that's why it's such a priority to come to the house of God on a Wednesday night you should put God first in everything that you do and yearn to live by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of God what is it we've come into an age we have the open book we have the revealed word for our hour but what happens is people get laxed in this this lukewarm age they begin to get laxed and they begin to get lukewarm and then then you know what they begin to do is they begin to take parts of the message that they don't understand or they don't agree with or maybe this doesn't fit my lifestyle and they begin to you know what we don't need to do that or the prophet didn't mean that or the you know let's talk about shorts and you know I used to battle as a young man with shorts and I didn't understand it because you know what we begin to do like I said in in our own reasoning and understanding we begin to say well brother Brandon listen whenever it was back in your day you called it a big Society women's undergarments well the shorts were right here come on brother brandom now they make shorts down past my knees what's the difference between it past my knees and sisters wearing skirts you begin to judge and you begin to add your own reasoning you begin to add your own well well I don't understand it no it's that's what he said he said kick those things out take those things out of your lives am let us stick with the word of God am to be more dedicated ated to yearn to be in church to be more sincere listen if the prophet came to his the end of his ministry and he said if I need to be more sincere and then he be to say and then he he he would go on and he would talk about man I've I've I've come to the end of my Ministry I haven't even done anything for Christ what he said man how little that makes me feel then if a prophet of the age that's right if the prophet the age says I can be more sincere I can be more dedicated to Christ how much more can we as the bride of Christ say I can be more sincere absolutely this isn't a a copy and paste message where we just copy and paste what we like and what we don't like no it's the word of God that's AUM thumb them I won't get into it because it's it's farther down in my notes but back in the Old Testament they would have the breastplate of Aaron and that was the Aon Thum and if there was a prophecy or a prophet that would want to come and speak a prophecy or if they had a dreamer or whatever it was they would have to come and the lights would begin to to flicker from the stones if it was a true prophecy or not but yet we have in this day in irum Thum a tie poost and that's the word of God if you have a question there's a Bible answer take it back to the word of God and see what he says amen in this message as I begin to listen the other day and we know that the opening of the seals God would begin to reveal these great Mysteries to us in this day and he would begin to before he would begin to preach he was there at brandham Tabernacle and he would preach one sermon right before the seals God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the saint yeah I'm so thankful that God he comes he comes to the meek he comes to the low he comes to those that that are not well educated those that may maybe don't understand it all but he didn't ask you to understand it all he just said believe it but God hiding himself in Simplicity and he reveals himself in the same what is he doing even tonight the ministry of the moon what is he typing Christ and his bride but he reveals himself speaks in Simplicity and we see that God when he hides himself here that then he be would begin to reveal himself in such a simple way that people would miss him they said they missed him because they were looking for him in a certain way they they thought he would come some other way and yet he come in the way that they didn't expect sometimes God comes in your life in a way that you don't expect he might come in a way that you least expect Ed let me use this example it comes to me I was driving the other day and we had this homeless man on the side of the road and he's walking with a sign and he's coming and he's approaching me and his sign says hungry well I just bought a a brand new small bag of chips in the in the the gas station there so I roll down my window and he's coming my way and I reach out to hand it to him and he says no thank you I'm good your sign says hungry I just give you food but yet sometimes that's what happens God is trying to give you something and you're asking you say God I have a need I want you to answer the prayer this way Lord would you come by my way would you Minister and yet God comes by in a simple way and he says here you go son and you say I'm good my goodness I say God help us I want all that he has for me I want everything God if it's if it fits my life is if something that that I don't see coming whatever it may be sometimes he sends a trial my way and I don't understand it but I say God if this is your will I want to be in your perfect will I would rather be in his perfect will than my permissive will yes the ministry of the Moon we know that brother bradam would be a typologist and he would begin to type things in his Bible he would say I didn't go to school to learn this but then he be he would show you throughout his whole Ministry he would show you types and shadows and we know that God's first Bible was written in the heavens the Zodiac and as God began to place things there he would place the the the Leo the Lion and he would place the the great Galaxy the Milky Way and he would place this planet here and this planet there and and Jupiter over here and as he began to place there was a reason for his positioning and placing they were all placed for a certain purpose and yet within just the the the the the Galaxy alone but we know in earth as we'll read here that there's diversities and differences and yet as we read what is reflected in heaven or what is reflected in Earth is reflected in heaven so let's turn to 1 Corinthians 15 1 Corinthians 15 and 3 uh8 says but God giveth it a body as it it pleth him to every seed his own body All Flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of men another flesh of Beast another flesh of fish another flesh of of birds and there are also celestial bodies and bodies in the terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another now he's talking about the resurrection of the body here in this portion of scripture and we jumped right in the middle of it but I thought this was so profound that he's trying to say something here because he says there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon and another Glory of stars plural and one star differ from another star in glory so there's one glory of the Sun and one glory of the moon but there's many stars that are up there and we know that in Genesis 1 and6 that he made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser night to rule the night and he made Stars also so we see here that one star differeth one from another now I had to take take a just a side note because I begin to as I begin to look into this where do where does the sunlight where does the sunlight there well where does the Moonlight begin to get its sunlight we know that but I begin to look and I begin to see where does the stars get their light where do stars get their light stars produce their own light and an energy by a process called nuclear fusion you see that's why there's differences amongst them because they don't all have the same light source you see the Moon gets its light from the sun it has no glory within itself it has no light to give itself but it is a reflection of the Sun the thing about stars listen we're going to talk naturally here the thing about stars we see it all over our universe all over our world but Naturally Speaking we see stars in The Sports World we see SP stars in in concerts and we see Rising Stars over here and you get an athlete and you you got these Olympic Games going on and you see this young man that can run so fast and he can break world records and he becomes a star but yet just as fast as that star Rises it's going to fall it begins to fall and these stars begin to have Glory within them elves they begin to want to sh outshine one another out there they praise him I trust it's not in here but out there in the world they praise him for what they can do on the field oh they can jump fast they can throw the ball hard listen I was I'm a sports fan and if you idolize these men as there's something let me tell you they have nothing to do with your life their life does not affect you one way or the the other whether your team wins the World Series or not nothing affects you that shouldn't affect you that shouldn't determine the way you live or what you idolize or the way you dress you shouldn't look to those natural stars but we see that these Stars put out their lights and we worship these stars there in Hollywood and we would call them Hollywood stars for what they can do but yet let me ask you something would you want to have their home life would you want to live where they do would you want to have the the alcohol problems and the drug problems and being married two and three times and being in depression and having anxiety listen they think that's living and that's what Satan has to offer his Stars we're going to get into it Satan pulled Stars away in the beginning and is doing the same tonight these stars are a form of influence both good and evil and they want to outshine one another but if we aren't careful and he'll creep into the message and you become a star and you want to project your own light you want to project one you know you want to be outshine one another that shouldn't be the mentality that we have in the message because we're not here to reflect listen we're not to here to shine our own light but we're here to reflect the Sun and to be the ministry of the moon so we see here that within stars in the beginning is where Lucifer began to do his work you see God's first attribute when he said let there be light light came forth Lucifer is the bringer of light God's first attribute Lucifer came forth and you say how is that so brother brandham says that Lucifer was God's right-hand man in the beginning so we see that this attribute came forth and Lucifer the definition of Lucifer means bearer of light or Morning Star it refers to his former Splendor as the greatest of the Angels his former splend spend yeah his former Splendor right and as I begin to look into this it popped up on Wikipedia so you can believe it if you don't that's okay but Wikipedia pulled it up and I was just and this definition or th this uh uh this this yeah this definition or meaning just spoke to me and it was in a way it says the tradition usually reverts as Lucifer not as a devil not as the devil listen how subtle this is how soft it makes it sound a little bit nicer but a destroyer a guardian a liberator a lightbringer or a guiding Spirit to Darkness a guiding Spirit to Darkness you see if you say oh that's a devil or that's it might prick somebody else's well that's a devil but that's a little too hard let's call him a liberator you know what he's trying trying to do he's trying to offer you Liberation he's trying to give you that freedom and yet he's a guiding Spirit to Darkness you see he's a deceiver and a liar there's nothing he has to offer he has nothing to offer you what is his end goal for you what is his end goal after he offers you the world and he gives you and he makes you a star and you can be the greatest you can be a Instagram sensation right you have all kinds of stars rising up they have you know you can do a a 15 second interview and you can be become a star and have interviews all around the world and what is Satan using he's using that to influence your mind he's trying to get to you through that Gateway but yet we see what is his end goal after all that he has to offer after this life what does he have to give nothing yeah nothing Isaiah 14 and12 says how Thou Art Fallen fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations for thou has said in thy heart I will a sin listen he didn't speak it out loud he said it in his heart God God is a discerner of the heart amen I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high and boy are we living in a generation where it's all about I and everybody has their rights you see the reason I'm giving you this definition of Lucifer because I want you to understand who he is brother brandom says you better know who your enemy is you better know his tactics because when he comes in and he tries to be a liberator and he wants to give you Freedom you better identify what Freedom he's trying to give you he's a bearer of false light perverting that very true light in the beginning and and so here I want to establish a few of the things that I've said by the prophet the God of this evil age 65 he says it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God he took 2third twoth thirds of the stars of heaven and ascended himself above the stars and he preached to them how are people being deceived how are people being even deceived within the message they're being preached to and deceive 2third of them you'll see and notice that was his ambition the Seal of the Antichrist he says did you know that in heaven that the devil was God's right-hand man in the beginning that Lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason that he brought sin into the world he was able to take something that God had created and pervert it back into an evil thing which started all this trouble in in the beginning then God back before the foundation of the world was ever laid listen before the foundation was ever laid when God had seen what Satan had done in his pride went over in the north and set up a kingdom and fought against Michael and his angels He says the right hand man of almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning the first God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a coworker partly equal partly equal I remember brother Mario preaching a sermon or in it he said you are co-workers with God you are co-workers with God and yet from the very beginning Satan Lucifer the one that was that was so close to God was a part coworker with god listen how close it is the deception that is coming down in our day do you understand things out there aren't going to deceive you if you believe this message is true things way out there aren't going to deceive you but it's going to be things very close He's a Part cooworker partly equal with him and listen he says partly equal with him but I'm so glad to a son and daughter of God the Bible says think it not robbery to be equal with God that's your right and that's my right tonight not part ly not partial amen but equal with God only Satan could not create God is the only Creator but Satan took something that God created and perverted it back into something else that was evil one more quote here he says if you notice Lucifer is doing the exact same thing tonight that he did in the beginning Lucifer at the beginning wanted to build himself a kingdom which is greater and more beautiful than Michael's Kingdom Christ and he that was that was his ambition to achieve something like that and what did he get to do get to do it by he took Fallen Angels Fallen Angels who had lost their first estate he took that to do with it do it with let's skip down to save time he says what is it he's doing it with Fallen Angels Fallen Lucifers Fallen meth is Fallen Pentecostals that lost their original estate from the word of God and going right back into make some Big E commical move Fallen Messengers listen Fallen Messengers who once stayed with the word but sold out their birth right to join into the world Listen we're not just talking this was brother branham's day that he would go to to the Luthers and he would go to the Pentecostals and he would go and preach to all these different ones because there was no message churches there was very few but how far have we come bring it to right now fallen Messengers Fallen message people fallen message preachers that have walked away left their birth rate walked away from the word of God trying to deceive the people fallen Messengers who once stayed with the word but sold out for their Birthright he says that the same a same thing is in this last day and Lucifer is achieving it today by man whose Spirits in them that he did with the angels at the beginning Fallen Angels who kept not their first estate to obey God and he's doing the same thing today why is this deception so close it could deceive the very elected if it was possible he has to bring something so fine but let me tell you something my Revelation my understanding of this message is not based upon some man if some man in this message begins to fall away and he begins to preach some something way out there listen I ain't focused on on the make belief people don't study when you study the real dollar bill when you study that dollar bill you'll know a fake one when it comes across your path I don't need to get caught up in all the nonsense out there and if you get caught up in the nonsense listen there might be one that comes against you but there's another hundred more waiting for you and it's not a time to wait upon those fake dollar bills forget those guys let us focus on the goal that lays ahead I want to press into the mark that lays before me I want to take care of my life and my family's life I want to make sure that my home is in a position to make the Rapture I'm not worried about other families I'm not worried about other churches amen because if everybody makes sure that your calling an election is sure listen when you get in the ball game brother Ron said it many a times when you get in the game listen it don't matter if I'm the running back and you're the lineman there's not a glow there isn't glory in be linemen they're in the they're in the trenches but let me tell you something when you score a touchdown it's for the whole team and now is the time now is the time now is your ministry to play your part I don't care who you are what position you play just get in the game play your position because let me say this if you don't if your ministry if your ministry is not being shared if you're not living the life that you should you know what happens it affects everybody that's under you if you're a husband and you're not priorities are not in place what happens all the family begins to slip if you're a wife and you're not doing the duties and fulfilling those duties what happens everybody under you begins to feel the effect of that yes sir that's right that's why it's important that each one of us holds our ministry you don't have to preach the gospel live the life of Christ Isaiah 5 and 20 says woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put Darkness for light and light for dark darkness that put bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes impr it in their own sides but I'm so thankful that's not you and I listen we don't choose Darkness over light we're here to choose light over Darkness we're here to choose the word of God in our day I don't want to be some star listen to me I don't want to be some star trying to share my own Ministry his or shine my own light that's not what we're called to Saints and if you're trying to compete and you're trying to share one this this gift and that gift and you're trying to compete your light and I'm a better singer and this no no no that's nonsense stop trying to be a light amongst yourselves be the moon shine his light we know that Darkness Darkness it would as Darkness would creep in Andross Darkness the people Darkness would dull some senses as I did in the beginning of the last service that you would turn off the light it would it would it would dull your your your line of sight it would hinder that perception maybe you wouldn't be able to hear where the sound is coming from my son Nolan when we're laying in bed and something happen what's that noise what's that noise and you see that it it would dull our senses we wouldn't have a a perception on certain things but also Darkness what it'll do is it will en heighten or heighten that of your imagination it would begin to mess with the the the the gates of the Soul imagination reasoning all those different ones it would begin to play a part if we were to turn off the light and you would feel this th this fear come over yet you know where you sit you know where the exit is but yet it still causes something in our own human minds and we begin to imagine certain things we begin to imagine even noan laying in bed and he would look across the room and it's a plant but when you turn off the light it's it's a palm leaf that hangs over the window there a little bit and he would say hey that's a lizard tail like would an imagination know that's not yes it is no it's not son you turn on the light it reveals it it reveals what it is you see what that light does the light of the word of God it's a revealer it shows things in darkness amen but we know that here that that there's those five gates to the soul imagination reasoning conscience all those ones and Satan would begin to mess with your mind he would try to bring you into a place of Darkness but yet we know that as a believer in Christ that we have a sick sense that God has given us a six sense not to go by our five senses of SE taste smell here we don't go by those senses why because as Darkness begins to surround us listen it might Dole the other senses but it doesn't doll or weaken our six sense because that six sense is our faith in the word of God it is that faith in in the light of the hour and so when God be he comes and he gives you that six sense listen no matter how dark it gets no matter how dark it gets out there listen you have that six sense hold on to that six sense because though we don't feel it though we don't understand it though we don't see God working he's still working in our lives my goodness let me hurry here in Lucifer we see that as he have he had deceived the stars in the beginning and led them away let me skip some of this you are not called to shine your own light let's see here let's show the picture I want to talk about the the phases because I want to get through this the phases of the sun because I'm going to go into something and this was my main thought for the tonight I begin to look up the the phases of the Sun and as we see here though it might be small we see that to the left is a cycle of the sun it is the birth but underneath it you might see and it says in billions of years so 1 to 14 in billions of years so what you're telling me is that the sun doesn't change very often if it changes every so many billions of years the change the sun is consistent it is stable it rises every day it comes up in the East and it sets in the west you can count on the sun to rise it's Dependable it's reliable does that sound familiar does that sound familiar just as not only the sun types this but not only the Su in but the s o in he's Dependable he's reliable he's unchanging he says I am God and I change not I am the same yesterday today and forever but I want you to let's get over to the next picture I want you to notice the difference of being in the position of the Moon the position of the Moon the Moon goes through phases the moon goes through stages in its life and it's a cycle of Life wouldn't it been easier if God made us the sun wouldn't life be so much better that if God Made You the Sun and life was consistent you didn't have to worry about anything no trials nothing everything every day it was the same consistency but the moon you see here goes through seven phases to make the new Sun the new moon again it goes through Cycles how many can relate to this Moon here in their lives you go through through phases you go through times in your life you go through situations you go through trials one minute you're shining like the full moon and you're on fire for God and you haven't had a trial in a while and you're serving God and you're amening then all of a sudden phases happen you begin to shine a little bit half and then all of a sudden it gets to a Crest and there's a small Li sliver of light but let me tell you something just because it's a small sliver doesn't mean she's lost her position doesn't mean there's any there's no lesser Light Within her she hasn't lost her position I want to encourage you that just because you have that small liver sliver of light maybe it's a trial maybe it's a sickness maybe it's something you're going through in a phase of life do you know why the moon has phases because it is the cycle and as the sun rotates what it begins to do what is God doing with the moon it's changing her position it begins to shine on different parts of that Moon it doesn't shine just on one part but maybe God needs to work on a different side of you maybe he needs to work on this side of you and he wants you to reflect a different side what is God doing he's changing your position and that's what he's done all down Through the Ages brother brandom we would see in the next picture that he would use this in the seven Church ages and he would refer that as the moon the cycle the phases of the moon here and we would see that in uh Ephesian in Paul's day it was a great light it was a great light and then as time would go on it would become a decreasing light and then you have the Dark Ages there and a darker age in the climax in Columba and then you would see the Reformation would begin and the Reformation continues into Lutheran what is it it's the cycle of the moon but yet just as there was seven phases a new moon is coming a new moon is coming let me tell you God your new moon is coming you might be in this cycle but a new moon is coming God isn't didn't send this message to reform he didn't send it just to to bring you to justification and sanctification what is this message sent for it is a restoration message it is is to restore us back to A New Beginning you see if the prophet would say that he couldn't see anything past you can take it down Brothers if you could see the prophet would say back in back in I don't even remember when he said it but back and he was talking about that that Darkness was so gross upon the people that he couldn't see past 1977 and here we are in 2024 where are we 47 years passing how dark is this age where are we at in God's timeline I'm going to bring this to the a close musicians come brother brandham would say in a paradox he says it's a paradox when you watch the Moon look at the Tides go out on the coast and on Angry the waves with about four fifths of the earth almost in water go out to the seashore and watch that tide come in as those angry big waves breaking way out there half a mile out in the ocean or more beating against the ocean Bank why does it why does it come O why doesn't it come over he says there's just one thing keeping it from doing so that's the moon that's the moon he said God's watch doong he watches over the seashore because God has set its boundaries and it cannot pass that but when that Moon begins to turn around and look at father notice that tide will slip in then when it turns back it takes its place again it has you because it's God's Watchdog that Moon millions of miles away from Earth how can it affect the Earth how can it draw a line why don't the sea run in a few hundred miles and then stop because so God set its boundaries and he cannot pass that he's got a Watchman to see that it doesn't pass he's got a watchdog you he in the absence of the [Music] son he's got somebody watching he's got somebody reflecting his own light what a great responsibility we have what if their Watchman what if the Watch Dog [Music] what if that Watchdog doesn't keep its job what happens if you have a watchdog and he's watching your [Music] house somebody would come along and he would give him a treat he would just slip on something [Music] and then the next time he comes he slips something else pretty soon that watchdog's let down his guard sir he's let down his guard and that Watchman that Watchdog when he lets down his guard he lets down his boundaries he begins to let things happen that Watchdog That was supposed to watch over the heads of the house over the family in the home that Watchdog lets lets the guard down now he doesn't bark at the the thief that's coming up and that's what Satan's going to do he's going to try to slip something to you he's going to try to throw you something say it's okay you can allow that you can do that we are all made watch talk Watchmen brother Brandon would preach a sermon Watchman what of the night God has placed the moon here for a boundary because when Satan comes in like a flood what does he say I'm going to hold up a standard who is that standard yeah who is that watch who is those Watch Dog what a great responsibility it is for us fathers mothers we each have a Ministry that we don't let in the guard we don't let down the guard because if we let down the guard in one area listen if the moon doesn't hold her position if the moon doesn't hold her place what is the moon also there for for a gravitational it it evolves around an axis that if we take the Moon away this world would spin out of orament but the Moon is put there for a stabilization you are what stabilizes this world you're the only thing keeping this world together you know that he says I have an elect lady down there I have elect seedl and until that LE until that last elect seed comes into his position you were the Watchdog you are the Watchman don't let the boundary go because if we let the boundary go everybody in Earth the the seashore Naturally Speaking if the waves come and they beat and they beat and it beat and it seems like sometimes we're in a battle and it keeps coming and keeps coming like waves but yet if one of us begins to let down the bar if we begin to let slip along the seashore what happens the ocean just going to open up how important is our ministry Watchmen what of the night what is that true church ministry the ministry of that church will be the ministry of the son because it's a reflection of the same sun power the same sunlight that world will know when the Sun rises what it'll look like why will it know what it looks like because it's the same sunlight there's nothing different there should be nothing between the light that you reflect than the light the Vindicated word that was spoken people shouldn't be able to tell a difference they should be say that's God right there that's a Son of God that's a daughter of God why because your life speaks volumes let's [Music] stand my goodness let's just bow our heads and [Music] you know as I was studying and I don't believe that there's coincidence I believe that sometimes as you study and you come across something [Music] and God just begin to speak to my heart and I'm going to read this here we know the story many of you but Danny Greenfield where the Randon would tell this story that Danny Greenfield he was a preacher and Danny Greenfield he he would have a dream and on this night he had a dream and he thought that he had died and went up to heaven and he came up to the gates and the gate keeper keeper came and said who approaches this place he said I'm Danny Greenfield the Evangelist from America and he says just a moment Mr Greenfield I'll see if I can let you in if your name's on the book all right he looked the book over and he came back and said sir I'm sorry but your name is not on the book you must depart he said oh he said surely you're you're wrong I preached the gospel I I lived a good life said surely my name is on the book Saidi sorry he said he said it's not here he said what shall I do then he says you might have to appeal your case at White Throne judgment he says I have no choice well that's what I must do and he said he seemed like he began to move through the air like a at a traffic speed and he came into the presence of a light and as the light got brighter he got slower and slow and up after a while he come to a stop and the light was not coming from any certain place just all around and he said oh such a feeling to stand in that presence and there was a voice that came from the light and said who approaches my Throne like a great thunder coming out he said oh god Jehovah I'm an evangelist any green and I was turned away from the Gates of Heaven and I I was asked to appeal my case at your Justice he says very well I'll try you by my law Danny Green have you ever told a lie he said to that time I thought I'd been at least an honest man truthful but he said oh in that presence I've seen that I told a many a little things was kind of crooked had a had a double meaning and he said yes Lord I've lied Danny Green have you ever you ever steal he says if anything I thought I I'd been an honest man but in that presence of that light I remembered a many things little AAL that I pulled was shady brother and sister in the church around the neighborhood in the presence of your pastor you may seem pretty good but wait but wait till you're in the presence of that light that Perfect Light then he said he heard a voice come again and said Danny Green my Justice requires Perfection were you perfect in life he said no Lord I wasn't perfect he says I was just ready to hear this great blast come down and said I seemed like my bones and had disconnected I was shaken like I couldn't stop then I Heard a Voice that was as sweet as I ever heard said no mother could speak like that he said I turned and looked and I saw the sweetest face I ever saw he said he walked up and put his arms around me and said father that's true true Danny Green wasn't a perfect wasn't perfect in his life but there's one thing that he did in his life he stood for me down on Earth so here in heaven I'll stand for him he goes on to say I wonder tonight friends while we're in a group many facing others maybe some in their last as Mortals if you should die tonight who would stand for you your church your pastor your mother your father let me introduce you to one if you can't stand for him tonight or if you can stand for him tonight he'll stand for you now I don't read that because I realize that not all of us will come up to White Throne judgment but here we are in in the house of God and I can feel his presence a house of correction and I say oh God judge me now Lord we surrender Our Lives before you now Lord we want to say if there's anything that's not like you Lord if there any any fault or any failure or anything Lord would you correct us now take those Earthly things from our lives let us run the race that is set before us oh God and Father you put this on My Heart Lord is there one I don't [Music] know Lord don't let them wait till then don't let them wait until they come up to the Gates of Heaven
