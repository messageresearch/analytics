[32:55] other way right here oh yeah yeah he's
[32:59] got a bow
[33:01] tie
[33:03] huh we don't want to wake him
[33:06] up yeah we want him to
[33:13] rest just come a little closer
[33:17] here we know that every good gift that
[33:20] God
[33:22] gives it comes with a great
[33:26] responsibility the Bible says that we
[33:28] are to raise our children up in the
[33:29] admonition and nurture of the
[33:32] Lord You've named him well you've given
[33:36] him scriptural names that have a a
[33:40] meaning God being gracious God being his
[33:44] judge so we're
[33:46] asking in this hour when this is such a
[33:49] wicked and adulterous generation may
[33:53] this little Johan Daniel may he walk in
[33:57] the light of the hour of what which that
[34:01] we know is called the message of the
[34:04] hour may he be a mighty Gentile
[34:08] Warrior may he stand for those things of
[34:11] God if God carries his
[34:13] coming but we believe that he's coming
[34:16] soon but until then we will do all that
[34:20] we can to raise our
[34:22] children in the things of
[34:25] God Amen Let Us bow our heads together
[34:27] together if you would
[34:30] please kind Heavenly
[34:34] Father brother leas and sister Rachel
[34:38] now bring their newborn son Johan
[34:41] Daniel to be dedicated before you and we
[34:45] would ask father even as the scripture
[34:48] says and they brought unto him little
[34:51] children that he might bless them and he
[34:54] took them up in his arms and the
[34:57] disciples were upset they said why is he
[35:00] doing that and he said except that you
[35:03] come as a little child you shall no in
[35:06] no wise see the kingdom of God and then
[35:09] he took them up and he blessed them
[35:11] Father in thy stead I am now holding
[35:15] this young child and dedicating him back
[35:18] to you for a life of service may you
[35:21] bless him abundantly father watch over
[35:24] him and keep him father because we know
[35:27] that we have not the power to keep
[35:29] ourselves but we are kept by the power
[35:32] of God I pray that you keep a hedge
[35:35] about him father and I pray that his
[35:38] little eyes father will see the glory of
[35:41] God I pray that his ears will hear the
[35:44] word which will give him uh overcoming
[35:47] power father and Revelation to strike
[35:50] his little heart and his life father to
[35:53] live a life that would be pleasing to
[35:55] you may these little feet stand on every
[35:58] promise may they walk into that great uh
[36:02] kingdom of God into that New Jerusalem
[36:04] father and may they possess every gate
[36:07] of the enemy I pray I dedicate little
[36:11] Johan Daniel now to you for a life of
[36:14] service we ask it in Jesus Christ's

[38:37] God what can I say to your
[38:41] people what is it father
[38:44] that I can say that will be a
[38:49] help that will
[38:51] be something to strengthen them to see
[38:55] this hour in which we live
[38:58] and realizing that the enemy is doing
[39:00] everything that he can to try to
[39:04] dissuade to
[39:06] discourage to become a
[39:09] distraction so that we don't stay
[39:11] focused on the things because really
[39:14] what it's all about is Rapture or
[39:20] bust I don't want second
[39:24] place if you're going to
[39:26] run run to gain the prize if you're
[39:28] going to fight fight to
[39:31] win second place means
[39:35] tribulation that's where foolish virgin
[39:37] is headed God don't let there be one
[39:40] here found foolish on that day I pray
[39:44] that you give them the the isv of
[39:47] understanding give them the wisdom
[39:49] that's beyond that of
[39:52] Solomon the wisdom that is the very mind
[39:55] of Christ let us all Stand Together
[39:59] thank you
[40:01] musicians I just feel I've got quite a
[40:04] bit to go to so instead of singing we'll
[40:06] just go right into it God bless you I
[40:08] enjoyed the song
[40:14] special now the
[40:16] Bible shows us where everything has a
[40:19] beginning brother Brenham said there is
[40:21] a a book in the Bible it's called The
[40:23] Book of Beginnings what what what book
[40:26] is that in the Bible Genesis Genesis so
[40:29] we find that everything begins in
[40:32] Genesis that which begins in Genesis
[40:34] goes all the way through like a thread
[40:37] all the way down to the Book of
[40:38] Revelation so turn with me if you would
[40:40] to Genesis chapter
[40:44] 10 verses
[40:55] 8-10 gen genis CH
[40:58] 10 verse 8 and
[41:01] Kush begat
[41:03] Nimrod and he beg to be a mighty one on
[41:08] the
[41:10] earth and he was a mighty Hunter before
[41:13] the
[41:14] Lord wherefore it is
[41:19] said even as Nimrod the mighty Hunter
[41:24] before the
[41:26] Lord and the beginning of his
[41:30] kingdom was
[41:32] Babel where we get
[41:35] Babylon where did this
[41:37] start in
[41:40] Babel where did it come from seed of the
[41:44] serpent all the way down that's why
[41:47] we're in a modern-day
[41:49] Babylon Revelation chapter 17 if you
[41:52] would please
[42:03] Revelation 17:
[42:06] 1-6 and there came one of the Seven
[42:09] Angels which had the seven vials and
[42:11] talked with me saying come hither I will
[42:15] show unto thee the Judgment of the great
[42:17] whr that sth upon many
[42:21] Waters with whom the kings of the Earth
[42:24] have committed
[42:25] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[42:28] Earth have been made drunk with the wine
[42:30] of her
[42:31] fornication so he carried me away in the
[42:34] spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a
[42:37] woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[42:40] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[42:43] heads and 10 horns the woman was arrayed
[42:46] in purple and scarlet color and decked
[42:50] with gold and precious stones and Pearls
[42:54] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[42:56] abomination ations and filthiness of her
[43:00] fornication and upon her head was a name
[43:03] written mystery Babylon the great the
[43:06] mother of harlots and Abominations of
[43:08] the earth and I saw the
[43:11] woman drunken with the blood of the
[43:15] Saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[43:18] of
[43:19] Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with
[43:22] great
[43:24] admiration may God add the blessing to
[43:26] the reading of his word you may be
[43:27] seated this
[43:31] morning like to title my sermon this
[43:33] morning
[43:35] America a modern day
[43:39] Babylon I'd like to take a subject this
[43:43] morning of the handwriting on the
[43:47] wall now I just want to say before we
[43:52] get into this let me say a little bit of
[43:54] a precedent
[43:57] of what's happening in America
[44:00] today we just had an
[44:04] election and Donald Trump won by a
[44:08] majority
[44:10] vote but I don't want you to relax your
[44:15] spirits I don't want you to sit back and
[44:17] say oh okay we have a little bit more
[44:20] time because the way America is going is
[44:24] down
[44:27] and we do not put our trust in the
[44:31] system or in
[44:33] Trump amen okay it's kind of bad when
[44:38] you have to vote for the lesser of two
[44:43] evils is which what we have done and if
[44:46] you'll note he was raised Presbyterian
[44:50] his wife is the first
[44:53] Catholic first lady since
[44:57] um John F Kennedy's wife Jacqueline
[45:03] Kennedy and so the powers that are in
[45:07] there are not godly
[45:11] Powers they are
[45:14] puppets
[45:16] figureheads understand that even Trump
[45:19] he may be a better choice in what I
[45:21] would say Camala would
[45:24] be
[45:25] but Amica America is never going to
[45:28] change you think uh America is going to
[45:33] be great
[45:36] again she's
[45:38] done she's on her way down and I I want
[45:41] all of you to understand that because
[45:43] the times are going to get rougher this
[45:45] is not a sermon all of you are going to
[45:47] dance out of here shouting Hallelujah I
[45:50] know that it's going to be a
[45:53] warning thank you
[45:55] Lord It's going to be a declaration to
[45:58] you your family because the enemy is
[46:01] doing everything he can and people think
[46:04] well I can just walk away from the
[46:06] message and okay and I'll just go to
[46:09] another church do you realize that this
[46:11] message exposed to us that who was this
[46:15] great Harlot this in the Book of
[46:17] Revelation who sits upon many Waters
[46:21] with your people who hasn't a cup in her
[46:24] hand the cup of her filthiness and her
[46:27] Abominations so anything that she gives
[46:29] to the people that doctrinal incorrect
[46:33] teaching will lead to spiritual
[46:37] fornication that's right so you there is
[46:41] no clean tables outside of this word of
[46:47] God they're all full of
[46:50] vomit brother random said the devil
[46:52] travels in the name father son Holy
[46:55] Ghost so you leave this
[46:59] message where are you going to go to
[47:01] well I'll go to a a Feelgood
[47:05] church one that will not preach
[47:08] Holiness will not preach the thing
[47:11] things against
[47:13] sin why because they starting from the
[47:16] top down are guilty of those things so
[47:20] they just preach another Jesus
[47:30] so the Lord started dealing with my
[47:34] heart yesterday
[47:36] afternoon and it came to me about in the
[47:39] time of
[47:41] Daniel in the time of Babylon remember
[47:44] that now the Jews have been dispersed
[47:47] carried away down into
[47:49] captivity but even remember that during
[47:53] any dispensational change God was doing
[47:55] a dispens ational change you understand
[47:59] from the Jews now to
[48:02] Gentiles but there is a man there a
[48:05] Prophet by the name of
[48:07] Daniel and God is going to use him to
[48:10] speak even to the to those in power at
[48:13] that
[48:15] time and there was a handwriting on the
[48:21] wall and it troubled the king and he
[48:24] said if there's anyone that can
[48:28] decipher this handwriting on the
[48:31] wall I will make him you know chief of
[48:35] the religious people in the country of
[48:39] that
[48:40] time I want you to know that we've had
[48:43] one like an un
[48:45] Daniel and he and he said
[48:49] America understand there's a handwriting
[48:52] on the wall and kabad has been written
[48:54] over you I'm going to substanti
[48:56] apprciate some of this stuff CU I want
[48:59] you to understand the seriousness of
[49:01] this
[49:02] message and if you think that you can
[49:05] just leave quote the message because the
[49:07] message is
[49:09] Christ do we understand it it is the
[49:11] Christ of this
[49:14] hour and to leave it you go and you can
[49:18] live any kind of life you want
[49:22] to women you can cut your hair wear
[49:25] makeup paint your
[49:27] toenails fingernails you can wear
[49:30] clothes that is an Abomination to God
[49:34] you can wear immoral
[49:36] clothing and you can go to the church
[49:39] and'll never be talked
[49:41] about but you love Jesus don't
[49:44] you because God's going to he's just
[49:47] going to love you
[49:49] anyway that's the kind of thinking that
[49:52] Cain had God will accept any sacrifice
[49:57] that I give to
[49:59] him how many of them say Lord Lord but
[50:03] Jesus will say in that day many will
[50:07] come unto me in that day and saying Lord
[50:09] have we not done this in your name done
[50:10] that in your name and he will say depart
[50:12] from me you workers of iniquity I never
[50:16] knew you I never conceived you amen I
[50:20] love where Jesus says you call me master
[50:22] and
[50:23] Lord you say well for so I am am but I
[50:28] want to ask you how many of you have
[50:30] made him not just your
[50:33] Lord but your
[50:35] master to do what he would want you to
[50:40] do so many call him Lord because they
[50:43] want fire
[50:45] insurance they don't want to go to hell
[50:47] so I'm just going to you know I'll call
[50:50] him Lord I'll get baptized and I'll
[50:52] become religious and uh you know I I
[50:56] I'll try to keep keep the Ten
[50:57] Commandments I've met so many people say
[50:59] hey I I'm a Christian I've never killed
[51:02] anybody you know just you know they they
[51:05] go to extremes on stuff like that but
[51:08] what about and I want to I want to ask
[51:10] all of you what is this
[51:12] message in this hour what's it done for
[51:20] you what are you doing with
[51:23] it are you eating it
[51:27] are you taking the book that is now open
[51:30] in the hand of him who sat upon the
[51:33] throne remember in Revelations chap 5 it
[51:36] was a closed book so between Revelation
[51:39] CH 5 and Revelations chap 10 there was a
[51:43] there was a happening an event because
[51:46] remember John was so distraught there
[51:48] was no one in heaven or on Earth to take
[51:51] the book The Book of
[51:53] redemption brother BR said two parts
[51:56] toed Redemption first part is
[51:58] Calvary second part is to redeem that
[52:02] which Calvary
[52:04] purchased
[52:05] hallelujah
[52:11] amen understand that this message that
[52:14] has been brought to
[52:16] us is not to be just condensed down to a
[52:20] few rules women don't cut your hair
[52:24] don't weigh makeup this that boys don't
[52:27] wear shorts we go to church we pay our
[52:29] ties that's
[52:31] it this message is
[52:34] Christ and
[52:36] Christ is a
[52:39] person it's a
[52:45] spirit
[52:47] and as I was meditating and seeking God
[52:52] the thought came to me that God is his
[52:54] own interpreter
[52:57] absolutely God interprets his word by
[53:00] bringing it to
[53:02] pass and I think that there's been so
[53:05] much confusion down Through the Ages
[53:07] starting from Genesis all the way down
[53:10] because different ones have taken the
[53:13] word of God and put their interpretation
[53:15] to it if God is going to come why surely
[53:19] he's going to come to probably the pope
[53:22] he's going to come to him first because
[53:24] he's the vicer of God of course God and
[53:27] and probably the ramparts of heaven will
[53:30] open and we'll see him come down and
[53:32] there'll be trumpets and all kinds of
[53:34] stuff and we'll know and that that's his
[53:36] second
[53:39] coming the Bible says he'll come like a
[53:41] thief in the
[53:43] night so we know there are several
[53:46] comings in the
[53:47] scripture I'm not getting into that this
[53:51] morning but God interprets his word by
[53:55] bringing it to pass
[53:58] so God doesn't need your
[54:02] help if he gives us a
[54:04] word that they'll be rapturing faith we
[54:07] don't have to work it
[54:11] up brother Brenham said rapturing faith
[54:14] is in you
[54:20] now it is not
[54:22] something that uh you're going to find
[54:26] mysteriously one day and say oh that's
[54:29] rapturing Faith now I got it no it's in
[54:32] you because it lays inside of you
[54:35] because of a
[54:36] seed and because of that seed God
[54:39] watches over that seed because he made a
[54:42] covenant with our Father
[54:45] Abraham and he said I'm going to give
[54:47] you an unconditional covenant thank you
[54:50] Lord now if you take that and you preach
[54:52] it that you can do anything and and live
[54:56] any
[54:57] kind of life you want to and say that
[54:59] God is going to take you to heaven then
[55:02] you make God's grace
[55:05] disgrace but I do believe and I'm guess
[55:09] I'm going to throw something out here
[55:10] now that God watches over his
[55:14] seed regardless of what you do and he
[55:19] may make you
[55:20] suffer for the incorrect
[55:23] decisions but you're still going to make
[55:26] it
[55:32] Hallelujah why because God watches over
[55:35] his predestinated elect
[55:37] seed he's watching over it when Abraham
[55:41] lied God did not say Okay Liars will not
[55:44] make it you're out
[55:46] Abraham when David committed adultery he
[55:49] didn't say okay no adulterers will make
[55:51] it you're out David no there was a
[55:54] mediator there for everyone of
[55:57] them there was an advocate do you
[56:01] understand we have a high priest we have
[56:04] an advocate we have one that intercedes
[56:07] for us when we do
[56:11] wrong
[56:14] Hallelujah who can lay any
[56:17] charge any sin to the elect of God oh
[56:22] you make mistakes but you don't sin
[56:26] amen you understand
[56:28] that sin is
[56:30] unbelief but you believe but you make
[56:35] mistakes yet at the end of the road
[56:37] guess
[56:39] what huh Brother
[56:41] Andy we
[56:43] win never forget
[56:45] that Andy came to me one day he says
[56:49] brother honor I I read the end of the
[56:52] book we win
[56:57] little things like that little nuggets
[57:00] of life I want all of you to understand
[57:02] no matter what you go
[57:04] through no matter how dark the
[57:07] day no matter how much the opposition
[57:10] against you no much no matter how much
[57:12] the persecution no matter how hard it
[57:15] may look God is with you he will be with
[57:18] you even in you until the end of the
[57:21] world so therefore you have an assurance
[57:26] hey this is not from what man is telling
[57:29] you it's what God's telling you I'll be
[57:31] with
[57:33] you second Peter chapter 1 I haven't
[57:35] even started preaching I'm just trying
[57:37] to relax my spirit I I I came here and I
[57:42] had printed out my notes at home but
[57:46] guess what my printer was out of red and
[57:48] yellow ink and so everything that I had
[57:51] that had red was missing
[57:57] you know all I did is grab my notes come
[57:58] here and so I went back to yes yes you
[58:01] got to help me out here buddy okay
[58:04] where'd you put it I don't know it's
[58:06] it's on my computer well it's where
[58:08] where was it was it G Drive was it
[58:11] Google Drive
[58:13] yeah that's a
[58:15] mystery so anyway he found
[58:19] it he sent it to the printer he printed
[58:22] it
[58:24] out I said you're my hero WR
[58:27] today so I'm a little bit nervous
[58:30] because those kind of things I don't
[58:31] like to make
[58:33] mistakes and I don't like to have things
[58:37] don't go exactly the way that I want it
[58:40] to but that's
[58:42] life huh that's
[58:46] life is that with your life
[58:48] also hey guess what you're going to have
[58:53] issues you're going to have things come
[58:55] up you're going to have have things
[58:57] thrown at you you're going to fall
[58:59] you're going to make a mistake you're
[59:01] going to say and do things wrong but
[59:03] guess what God's with
[59:07] you and if you're his guess what you're
[59:11] going to get a spank
[59:13] it that's all five-fold
[59:17] Ministry okay and it's not going to be
[59:19] over top of a big thick pamper
[59:26] no you pull it down and get a little bit
[59:29] of
[59:33] skin now ain't child abuse that's child
[59:39] training
[59:41] amen second Peter chapter 1 let me go on
[59:44] now if I can here and this voice which
[59:47] came from heaven we
[59:49] heard when we were with him in the Holy
[59:54] Mountain we have also a more sure word
[59:58] of
[59:59] Prophecy where unto you Do Dwell that
[1:00:02] you take heed you do well that you take
[1:00:06] heed as unto a light that shineth in the
[1:00:09] dark place until the day
[1:00:13] Dawn and the day star arise in your
[1:00:17] hearts knowing this
[1:00:20] first that no Prophecy of the scripture
[1:00:25] is of any private
[1:00:28] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[1:00:31] in Old Time by the will of
[1:00:33] man but holy men of God spake as they
[1:00:37] were moved by the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost so I want you to understand all
[1:00:42] the way from Genesis to Revelation
[1:00:44] whenever a prophetic word
[1:00:47] comes there's always those that try to
[1:00:50] figure it out or say well this is
[1:00:53] that and I say unto all of us here let
[1:00:57] us be extremely careful even with this
[1:01:00] message and with different things
[1:01:02] because sometimes it looks like it could
[1:01:05] be but if the prophet didn't tell it if
[1:01:08] he didn't expose it and say this is that
[1:01:12] then what we do we just leave it alone
[1:01:14] because I want a sure
[1:01:18] foundation so I say that to all of our
[1:01:22] ministers let's stay on that solid what
[1:01:26] we know to be the revealed word am and
[1:01:29] not try to get out and try to impress us
[1:01:31] with some kind of spiritual
[1:01:35] something let's stay simple amen all
[1:01:43] right you know I one of the first
[1:01:46] lessons I learned when I came into this
[1:01:49] message was different ones started
[1:01:53] taking and interpreting the word to us
[1:01:56] and I've told you about this but I'm
[1:01:58] going to show you in the scriptures
[1:02:00] where this brother got it so in
[1:02:02] Revelations chapter 9 verses 7-10 now
[1:02:07] I'm going to put a disclaimer here
[1:02:08] because I don't want somebody on the
[1:02:10] internet to take this and say this is
[1:02:12] what brother Ron is teaching this is
[1:02:15] what was taught to me incorrectly
[1:02:17] because you know the Beatles are in the
[1:02:20] Bible huh what's another word for Beetle
[1:02:24] Locust okay so let's read this
[1:02:26] revelation of The Beatles in the Bible
[1:02:29] revelations 9
[1:02:31] 7-10 and the shapes of the Locust were
[1:02:34] like Into Horses prepared under battle
[1:02:37] and on their heads were as it were
[1:02:39] crowns like gold and their faces were
[1:02:42] the faces of
[1:02:45] men and they had hair like the hair of
[1:02:50] what
[1:02:52] women and their teeth was the teeth of
[1:02:55] lions
[1:02:56] she loves you yeah yeah yeah okay I'm
[1:03:02] wanting you to just catch this this is
[1:03:04] what I was told and
[1:03:08] wow here's an old test here's a Old
[1:03:11] Testament Prophet as he's seeing things
[1:03:14] or a new testament I should say as he's
[1:03:16] seeing something and these brothers were
[1:03:18] interpreting this to me and I'm going
[1:03:20] wow and they had breastplates and the
[1:03:23] breastplates were of iron what is it
[1:03:25] what is that that's a
[1:03:28] guitar
[1:03:31] okay and the sound of their wings was as
[1:03:34] the sound of Chariots of many horses
[1:03:36] running to
[1:03:40] battle do you see
[1:03:43] that and had tails had tails like under
[1:03:48] scorpions and there were sting in their
[1:03:50] tails that's the cord going to the
[1:03:54] amplifier wow
[1:03:56] are you guys
[1:03:58] impressed yeah Circle that in you put
[1:04:01] the Beatles tell everybody about it no
[1:04:04] that's incorrect it may sound good wow
[1:04:09] without any kind of
[1:04:10] Revelation without the prophet tell did
[1:04:13] the prophet tell us that no but he did
[1:04:16] say that the Beatles weren't even in
[1:04:19] God's
[1:04:23] thinking and he says talking about
[1:04:27] anointing he says they're Anointed with
[1:04:30] their music so much so that the next
[1:04:33] thing that they could do is go and start
[1:04:35] a healing campaign how many of you know
[1:04:38] that because people were just so
[1:04:40] inspired so enamored by them just
[1:04:43] because of their
[1:04:46] music so I wanted to just show you that
[1:04:50] you can type something out it may look
[1:04:54] like oh wow that that's pretty good but
[1:04:56] if the prophet didn't say it we don't
[1:04:59] say it amen just giving you an
[1:05:03] idea of some of those things in
[1:05:06] fact much of the time just throwing this
[1:05:10] out here now and understand this that
[1:05:13] the false doctrines and isms within this
[1:05:18] message are always somebody
[1:05:21] misinterpreting or self interpreting
[1:05:24] something the prophet
[1:05:27] said tent
[1:05:29] vision return
[1:05:31] ministry right any we we could take all
[1:05:34] of
[1:05:36] these and you could you could take each
[1:05:39] one of these and see that somebody made
[1:05:42] a little ISM I want to call it an ism
[1:05:45] did a grafted in Branch onto the tree
[1:05:49] and they say they're living off of this
[1:05:52] message and they are because the what it
[1:05:54] is it's a grafted in Branch but they're
[1:05:58] living off of the true message you
[1:06:01] follow me now do you remember that tree
[1:06:04] that brother Brenham I think it was down
[1:06:06] in Tucson that brother had a citrus tree
[1:06:09] and he grafted in all kinds of different
[1:06:13] Citrus
[1:06:14] branches into I believe the original
[1:06:17] tree was an orange
[1:06:19] tree and this man had grafted in
[1:06:23] lemons grapefruit
[1:06:26] tangerines all different
[1:06:29] kinds of citrus
[1:06:32] branches and brother Bram said wow so
[1:06:36] this this is brings forth tangerine and
[1:06:39] this Branch brings forth grapefruit and
[1:06:41] everything yes yes and he says oh my
[1:06:45] Hallelujah and he says well brother let
[1:06:48] brother br's asking him the question
[1:06:50] okay so next year next year when all the
[1:06:53] leaves go down and you know it goes down
[1:06:56] into the winter time and when the
[1:06:58] springtime comes again it'll every
[1:07:01] Branch will be
[1:07:02] oranges he said
[1:07:04] no because whatever is grafted into it
[1:07:07] will live off of the life of the True
[1:07:10] Vine are we
[1:07:13] together so brother bram's saying oh wow
[1:07:17] look at this if we graft something into
[1:07:21] this message by
[1:07:23] self-interpretation or wrong
[1:07:24] interpretation ation and we say well
[1:07:27] this is it this is
[1:07:31] whatever Doctrine we want to call it and
[1:07:34] then next thing you know we are living
[1:07:37] off of the life of the message but
[1:07:39] bringing forth the wrong
[1:07:50] fruit so in 1 Peter 1: 9-13
[1:07:56] I'm showing you how that when scripture
[1:07:58] came and Men of
[1:08:00] God were moved of the L of the Lord to
[1:08:04] speak the word of
[1:08:05] God 1 Peter 1:9 and receiving the end of
[1:08:09] your faith even the salvation of your
[1:08:12] souls of which salvation the prophets
[1:08:15] have inquired and searched
[1:08:18] diligently because they prophesied it
[1:08:20] now they're searching
[1:08:23] diligently who prophesied of the grace
[1:08:27] that should come unto
[1:08:29] you searching what or what manner of
[1:08:34] time the spirit of Christ which was in
[1:08:37] them did signify in other words this
[1:08:40] prophetic word they said something it
[1:08:43] was thus sayith the Lord God is going to
[1:08:46] do something and so they sought
[1:08:48] diligently they searched when is this
[1:08:51] going to
[1:08:53] happen and when it testified beforehand
[1:08:57] the suffering of Christ and the glory
[1:08:59] that should
[1:09:01] follow unto whom it was revealed that
[1:09:05] not unto
[1:09:06] themselves but unto us they did Minister
[1:09:10] the things in other words they
[1:09:12] prophesied it but it was for
[1:09:16] us which are now reported unto you by
[1:09:19] them that have preached the gospel unto
[1:09:22] you with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[1:09:26] heaven which things the Angels desire to
[1:09:30] look
[1:09:30] into wherefore G up the Lins of your
[1:09:33] mind be sober and hope to the end for
[1:09:37] the grace that is to be brought unto you
[1:09:40] at the
[1:09:41] revelation of of Jesus
[1:09:45] Christ many people ask me oh you're a
[1:09:49] you're a pastor you're a Christian yes
[1:09:51] sir I am what what kind of Christian are
[1:09:53] you what what kind of church do you have
[1:09:55] what
[1:09:56] denomination I said we're not a
[1:09:58] denomination well that you know that
[1:10:00] they can't figure that out because
[1:10:02] everybody got a categorize
[1:10:04] something okay are you you know in in
[1:10:07] Germany they only have two
[1:10:10] categories
[1:10:11] Protestant and
[1:10:13] evangelic or Catholic see and and so you
[1:10:17] know they they don't understand non-
[1:10:18] denomination when I first went to
[1:10:22] Germany
[1:10:24] what you're kids either Protestant or
[1:10:27] Catholic which which are you we're we're
[1:10:30] neither no no understand here in Germany
[1:10:33] you have to be one or the
[1:10:35] other and they tax you accordingly you
[1:10:38] know they take your taxes out they're
[1:10:41] ties out of your salary automatically
[1:10:45] either to the Catholic church or to the
[1:10:47] Protestant church so you just tell them
[1:10:49] so you don't even get a
[1:10:52] choice yeah you don't even get a choice
[1:10:55] well let me see I made $300 this week so
[1:10:58] I'll give 30 no no I'll give $29 or I'll
[1:11:01] give 25 because
[1:11:05] it how would you like us to do that
[1:11:10] Robert we don't need to do that you
[1:11:13] don't want to go there we could make
[1:11:15] money buddy
[1:11:23] huh I wonder how some of you pay your
[1:11:26] ties like you do your taxes I didn't
[1:11:29] make no
[1:11:30] money after all of my
[1:11:38] deductions do you pay it on the gross or
[1:11:41] the
[1:11:46] net hey why are you so
[1:11:51] quiet let me tell you you can't outg
[1:11:53] give God
[1:11:55] ties belong to
[1:12:00] God your
[1:12:02] offerings is after you've paid your ties
[1:12:05] do you know brother R said you can't
[1:12:06] even pay an offering unto the Lord until
[1:12:10] you've paid up your
[1:12:11] ties God help us and I'm not I didn't
[1:12:14] mean to go there and everything and I
[1:12:16] don't preach on tithing but it is part
[1:12:18] of the word of God Amen I believe that
[1:12:20] Christians pay their ties they do it
[1:12:23] amen
[1:12:26] all
[1:12:28] right so the people ask me what kind of
[1:12:30] church you well we're non-
[1:12:32] denomination well
[1:12:35] uh okay um well what kind of a Christian
[1:12:39] are you well I'm a born again Holy Ghost
[1:12:43] filled Bible believing
[1:12:47] Christian I'm a Apostolic I'm
[1:12:50] Pentecostal I'm Catholic I'm Baptist I'm
[1:12:53] Lutheran as long as you stay with the
[1:12:55] word of God because brother Brenham said
[1:12:56] that one time he said well I'm a Baptist
[1:12:59] Catholic Lutheran you know he said as
[1:13:01] long as you stay with the word you see
[1:13:03] what happened with each one of those is
[1:13:05] each one of those came under some kind
[1:13:08] of inspiration well we'll become
[1:13:10] lutherans we'll become methodists we'll
[1:13:12] become this and that and the next thing
[1:13:14] you know they took a group of people and
[1:13:16] pulled them away from the main group of
[1:13:19] Christians and down Through the Ages we
[1:13:22] have all of the different
[1:13:23] interpretations and so I've been
[1:13:25] wondering what is happening even now in
[1:13:28] this hour among our message
[1:13:33] churches could it be that some are
[1:13:38] making their own
[1:13:40] interpretation pulling off groups of
[1:13:43] people isolating them and saying we have
[1:13:46] it we're the
[1:13:50] ones and they're excommunicating anybody
[1:13:54] that doesn't believe leave just like
[1:13:55] them in fact you're
[1:14:01] out now I love brother brenham's spirit
[1:14:05] because the spirit he had was the spirit
[1:14:06] of Christ is that right let me give you
[1:14:09] an example when Junior Jackson and Don
[1:14:12] rutle split from Brother Brenham they
[1:14:14] were his sister churches how many of you
[1:14:17] know that he said they're our sister
[1:14:20] churches they've been there for years
[1:14:22] now brother Brenham preaches Church
[1:14:24] order and he sets the gifts in order and
[1:14:27] he makes people accountable for what
[1:14:30] they do with the gifts are we aware of
[1:14:32] that
[1:14:35] okay and they didn't like it so they
[1:14:37] pulled away from Brother Brenham they no
[1:14:39] longer went to Brenham
[1:14:41] Tabernacle so they took their people and
[1:14:44] the deacons really they started going
[1:14:47] after the Believers of Junior Jackson
[1:14:49] and and Don rutle and they were calling
[1:14:51] them dirty birds and all and brother
[1:14:53] Brenham comes to the pulpit
[1:14:55] he said now Brethren keep your mouths
[1:14:57] off them Junior Jackson believes this
[1:15:01] message as much as I do if he wants to
[1:15:04] have the gifts of tongues and
[1:15:06] interpretation and that working in his
[1:15:09] church that's his
[1:15:10] problem you understand he he didn't he
[1:15:15] didn't put him
[1:15:17] down he didn't try to expose how wrong
[1:15:20] they were or they left they went out
[1:15:23] from among us because they were not us
[1:15:26] he kept the right attitude God help
[1:15:31] us to have the right attitude that we
[1:15:33] not get this self-righteous I'm better
[1:15:36] than you or I see it more than you in
[1:15:38] fact humility can be found by the
[1:15:42] greater revelation of Jesus Christ when
[1:15:45] it comes into you does that make you a
[1:15:47] stuffed
[1:15:48] shirt does it make you a Know It All In
[1:15:51] fact when the wheat is full and ready
[1:15:55] for Harvest what does it
[1:15:58] do I will say this the more that I
[1:16:02] understand this message and the more
[1:16:03] that God opens to me the revelation of
[1:16:06] Jesus Christ the more I realize oh God
[1:16:10] you humble
[1:16:12] me I realize lord it's
[1:16:16] you I am so humbled before you that's
[1:16:19] the reason brother Brenham okay when
[1:16:22] those men and they came and they were so
[1:16:24] heart against him and said we want to
[1:16:26] pray for you cuz your your your Doctrine
[1:16:29] is
[1:16:32] Antichrist you know what he did he
[1:16:34] humbled himself right he said uh well
[1:16:38] Brethren he said you know I don't know
[1:16:40] now watch him watch him I don't know the
[1:16:43] Bible real
[1:16:45] well I don't I'm ignorant unlearned I
[1:16:49] got a seventh grade education I'm not
[1:16:51] like you
[1:16:53] guys he said but I know the
[1:17:02] author and when they got done and they
[1:17:04] prayed for
[1:17:05] him well brother Bren there's one thing
[1:17:08] we can say about you you have the spirit
[1:17:11] of
[1:17:13] Christ I'm going to make a challenge to
[1:17:16] each one of
[1:17:17] you when was the last time time somebody
[1:17:21] saw you in a situation
[1:17:25] and you acted correctly and you did
[1:17:29] right because the Bible
[1:17:31] says when they say all manner of evil
[1:17:34] against you
[1:17:36] falsely for my name's
[1:17:38] sake he said you should take it
[1:17:43] right if somebody asks of your
[1:17:47] coat or if they ask you to go two
[1:17:50] miles one mile go two if somebody slap
[1:17:54] AB your
[1:17:56] face do what turn the
[1:17:59] cheek this is Christianity
[1:18:02] 101 what about you and I yeah somebody
[1:18:06] disagree with us why we want to hack
[1:18:08] them up and kick them out and no brother
[1:18:10] brim said you can come here to this
[1:18:11] church even if you disagree with me just
[1:18:15] don't sew Discord right that's all hey
[1:18:19] brother ramam said I like cherry pie
[1:18:23] right he said when I eat cherry pie and
[1:18:25] I come to a seed I spit it out I don't
[1:18:28] throw away the pie that's how it is it
[1:18:31] should be with all of us and the Bride
[1:18:33] of Jesus Christ I'm going to lay my
[1:18:35] heart out this
[1:18:37] morning the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:18:40] United together they have a Unity around
[1:18:43] the word can you say Amen they are not
[1:18:46] divided they are
[1:18:48] one one Lord One Faith one baptism amen
[1:18:53] right then why are we
[1:18:56] divided because we have
[1:18:59] interpretations I say father help us to
[1:19:03] get away from
[1:19:04] interpretations and and this is how I
[1:19:07] see it and it's it can be no other way
[1:19:09] and if somebody sees it other than that
[1:19:12] then I'm going to call him
[1:19:13] out
[1:19:16] no pray for
[1:19:19] him that's all pray for them and love
[1:19:22] them
[1:19:25] because the Bible says love
[1:19:28] your that's not
[1:19:32] easy I've
[1:19:36] realized that
[1:19:38] recently I've gone through a few
[1:19:41] things my nature is by nature and excuse
[1:19:46] me I'm a
[1:19:51] fighter you get me up against the wall
[1:19:55] you push my button we got an
[1:19:58] issue
[1:20:02] okay but when the spirit of Christ
[1:20:06] comes I'm not the lion I'm the
[1:20:10] lamb there is a time in all of your
[1:20:13] lives when you know which you are to
[1:20:17] be to stand up for your rights and say
[1:20:22] this and get in their face and if you
[1:20:24] don't see it my way get out of the
[1:20:27] way or you say brother just pray for me
[1:20:30] amen I love you
[1:20:33] anyway and you don't write them off
[1:20:35] because you know what let me let
[1:20:37] me
[1:20:39] say how quick can Revelation come to a
[1:20:45] Believer instantly you mean to tell me
[1:20:48] somebody that's been
[1:20:49] off for a period of time in the message
[1:20:52] and they've made a certain way in
[1:20:54] they're kind
[1:20:55] of holding on to it and it's this my way
[1:20:58] or the highway and then all of a sudden
[1:21:02] God changes their mind
[1:21:06] instantly can God do
[1:21:09] that
[1:21:11] sovereignly amen what we
[1:21:14] need among this message right now is
[1:21:17] another move of the Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost is a real downpouring of the Holy
[1:21:23] Ghost cuz the Holy Spirit
[1:21:25] will lead you and guide you into all
[1:21:28] truth and he shall testify of
[1:21:32] himself
[1:21:38] amen right
[1:21:40] now America is in a
[1:21:43] transition she's in a
[1:21:46] transformation right now America is
[1:21:50] experiencing a religious Revolution
[1:21:56] we're in spiritual warfare as we've
[1:21:58] never been
[1:22:01] before things against Christianity and
[1:22:04] anti-Semitism are on the
[1:22:08] rise every other religion has their
[1:22:11] rights but Christians have no
[1:22:13] rights Jews are being hated just for the
[1:22:17] fact they're a
[1:22:23] Jew I walked through the
[1:22:26] gates of aitz there in Poland a couple
[1:22:30] times and above the gate there it says
[1:22:32] arbite
[1:22:34] M work makes
[1:22:37] freedom and they sent them from all of
[1:22:40] the different parts of Europe north
[1:22:43] south east and west and they brought
[1:22:45] them in on rail
[1:22:47] cars no food no water no gas station
[1:22:55] and they put him to the concentration
[1:22:58] camp and actually what it was it's
[1:23:00] called a death
[1:23:01] camp because they said the only way
[1:23:03] you're getting out of awit is through
[1:23:06] the smoke of the
[1:23:12] crematorium I've been there I've seen
[1:23:14] the
[1:23:15] places where they shot them they
[1:23:19] suffocated
[1:23:20] them they starved them
[1:23:25] because they were a
[1:23:28] Jew not because of something they
[1:23:33] did understand
[1:23:35] this what is coming
[1:23:38] upon America is a spirit that is going
[1:23:41] to rise up you see it in its infancy
[1:23:45] form right
[1:23:46] now true let me let me give you a quote
[1:23:50] on this so you know where I'm at
[1:23:55] why we are not a
[1:23:57] denomination you ever heard that
[1:24:00] sermon why we are
[1:24:03] not a
[1:24:07] denomination whom the kings of the Earth
[1:24:09] have committed
[1:24:11] fornications and the inhabitants of the
[1:24:14] Earth have made drunk with the wine of
[1:24:16] her
[1:24:18] fornication her wine is what she's
[1:24:20] giving out her
[1:24:22] stimulation we are the church we are the
[1:24:25] the ones that got
[1:24:27] it now just draw that in your mind
[1:24:31] now all right so he carried like the
[1:24:34] angel told John I will show you this
[1:24:37] judgment that's coming to this great
[1:24:39] church now watch so he carried me away
[1:24:42] in the spirit Into the
[1:24:44] Wilderness and I saw a woman sitting
[1:24:47] Upon A Scarlet colored Beast scarlet and
[1:24:49] the Bible represents
[1:24:51] Royal the color Scarlet means red
[1:24:54] and the Beast represents power did you
[1:24:57] notice the Beast come up out of the
[1:25:00] sea that was in Revelations the
[1:25:03] 13th and when you see the Beast coming
[1:25:06] out of the sea it's meant that this
[1:25:07] power was Rising among the
[1:25:09] people but in Revelations 13 when the
[1:25:12] lamb came up he came up out of the earth
[1:25:16] no people United States but then after
[1:25:21] he had two little horns civil and the
[1:25:23] ecclesiast astical
[1:25:26] Powers then he received the power and
[1:25:29] spoke like the
[1:25:32] dragon look at this going to turn from a
[1:25:36] lamb it looked like a lamb brother Ram
[1:25:39] said those two little
[1:25:41] horns he said they were seeing the
[1:25:43] American buffalo yes sir he said civil
[1:25:46] and ecclesiastical Powers it starts out
[1:25:49] like a
[1:25:51] lamb religious freedom
[1:25:54] but wait when she turns and speaks like
[1:25:58] a
[1:25:59] dragon okay watch
[1:26:02] this see Power spoke like the dragon did
[1:26:07] before him so you just got to mark it
[1:26:09] down we're coming into a religious
[1:26:13] persecution with the same things they
[1:26:15] did in Pagan
[1:26:17] Rome many years ago for
[1:26:21] it's thus sayith the Lord
[1:26:26] wow that doesn't sound very nice does
[1:26:31] it do you know what they did in Pagan
[1:26:34] Rome to
[1:26:37] Christians any of you ever been to the
[1:26:39] Coliseum in Rome
[1:26:47] yes I walked through the Coliseum with
[1:26:50] Brother Joseph brandham he and I were
[1:26:52] there one time
[1:26:57] the tour guide
[1:26:58] said this is the Gate of
[1:27:02] life and this is where all the people
[1:27:05] the Gladiators the martyrs everybody
[1:27:08] walked through the gate of
[1:27:10] life and they had to turn towards Caesar
[1:27:13] and say hail
[1:27:18] Caesar and said there's two gates that
[1:27:20] you go in and out of and said you either
[1:27:23] go back out the gate of life cuz you
[1:27:25] live through it or you're carried
[1:27:27] through the gate of
[1:27:30] death I've been
[1:27:33] there I've
[1:27:35] walked into that Coliseum where there
[1:27:40] was 65 80,000 people and I could just
[1:27:45] imagine them all
[1:27:49] cheering brother random calls American
[1:27:51] football uh a modern day Gladiator
[1:27:55] Spirit when they see somebody get hit
[1:27:57] and blood on the field blood makes the
[1:27:59] grass
[1:28:01] grow it is kill him get him knock his
[1:28:05] head
[1:28:08] off I've
[1:28:10] walked there were Christians LED out
[1:28:13] there with
[1:28:14] families mommies and daddies with their
[1:28:18] children walk out
[1:28:22] there and they stand there as a family
[1:28:25] unit and they open the doors and these
[1:28:28] lions that have not been fed for a week
[1:28:31] or two and they're just ravenous
[1:28:34] beasts and they see them standing there
[1:28:37] and a father will stand in front of his
[1:28:41] family bear his chest eat me First Take
[1:28:45] Me First and the people
[1:28:49] died and the more that they
[1:28:51] killed the more the people friends
[1:28:55] here is what the guide told me that
[1:28:59] absolutely excuse me for a lack of a
[1:29:01] better word it blew my mind he said the
[1:29:04] reason they stopped killing all of the
[1:29:08] martyrs because it was making
[1:29:11] Christianity
[1:29:15] grow it said by the time there was such
[1:29:19] a
[1:29:20] presence of those Martyrs that stood
[1:29:23] there
[1:29:25] willing to give their life for what they
[1:29:29] believed that there were Roman citizens
[1:29:33] who were not
[1:29:37] Christians come down out of the
[1:29:41] stands and stood with them to be
[1:29:47] bared they said The more we killed the
[1:29:50] more came to be killed
[1:29:55] think of
[1:29:56] that
[1:29:58] persecution brings out the best in the
[1:30:02] church we don't have it hard enough
[1:30:06] that's
[1:30:11] right because we got it too
[1:30:15] easy it's too easy we can come to church
[1:30:18] sit on a nice padded
[1:30:21] chair you didn't have to walk to church
[1:30:24] I don't think any of you had to
[1:30:26] walk I've been in
[1:30:29] Africa where I go and you know what they
[1:30:31] don't have pews they a little 2x4 you

[1:30:39] and they put a 2x4 over and the people
[1:30:41] sitting there it ain't very
[1:30:49] comfortable and they said brother Ron

[1:30:58] hours to get

[1:31:50] haven't had much
[1:31:52] food my goodness
[1:31:59] mystery
[1:32:00] Babylon has
[1:32:02] taken
[1:32:04] America and America has now become a
[1:32:07] modern day
[1:32:09] Babylon the government is so
[1:32:12] perverted the people in
[1:32:16] leadership the Bible says that God has
[1:32:18] turned them over to a reprobate mind
[1:32:21] that they might believe a lie and be
[1:32:23] damned they will call evil good and good
[1:32:27] evil Darkness will cover and gross
[1:32:30] Darkness will cover the
[1:32:33] people but thank God for this evening
[1:32:36] light thank God this message my brother
[1:32:39] my sister I don't understand when people
[1:32:41] say I'm leaving the
[1:32:43] message you never had a
[1:32:47] revelation it was just church to
[1:32:50] you it was just church yeah I don't want
[1:32:56] church I want
[1:32:58] life Give me liberty or give me death
[1:33:00] Let's either get in or get
[1:33:03] out let's be serious about
[1:33:09] it
[1:33:12] yes if they persecuted you and they beat
[1:33:17] you like others even in
[1:33:21] Vietnam the nominal Christian Christians
[1:33:24] most of them have already suffered
[1:33:27] persecution we had we had
[1:33:31] ministers that we started ministering
[1:33:34] this message to in Vietnam many of them
[1:33:37] they half of their teeth are
[1:33:41] missing I could tell you of the
[1:33:43] atrocities that have happened to
[1:33:45] them put in forc labor camps just
[1:33:49] because they owned the Bible right
[1:34:00] do you know what they love God with a
[1:34:04] ferency when we were in Vietnam this was
[1:34:07] not open you couldn't have open air
[1:34:09] meeting no this was still communist
[1:34:12] controlled we came in in the early
[1:34:15] morning under darkness and we left under
[1:34:21] Darkness we came in on motorcycle
[1:34:23] brother Malcolm he he rode another
[1:34:26] motorcycle went a certain way I went and
[1:34:29] went this way and we came in under
[1:34:30] darkness and we were the only ones that
[1:34:33] went in and out for about four or five
[1:34:36] days everyone else that came to the
[1:34:38] meetings they all stayed right
[1:34:41] there they turn the music up real
[1:34:44] loud downstairs because we're having it
[1:34:47] on the second story so that it would
[1:34:50] mask us
[1:34:52] ministering they couldn't hear our
[1:34:54] voices because the music downstairs was
[1:34:56] blaring to the people because oh in a
[1:34:59] communist country you get rewarded if
[1:35:02] you turn somebody in so everybody's
[1:35:04] looking
[1:35:05] to turn somebody in and get
[1:35:10] money they had been
[1:35:14] persecuted so they knew what it was like
[1:35:16] to miss a
[1:35:18] meal their family's taken away from them
[1:35:21] the one brother he had his teeth all ing
[1:35:24] I said what happened he said the officer
[1:35:27] came up there and took the butt of his
[1:35:28] gun and took to his face and just busted
[1:35:31] all his teeth
[1:35:34] out because you own a
[1:35:43] Bible mystery Babylon here in
[1:35:47] America is trying to water down what we
[1:35:50] believe
[1:35:58] brother brenon preaches a sermon the
[1:35:59] invasion of the
[1:36:03] USA listen I want to confess right here
[1:36:06] before I go any further I'm an
[1:36:08] oldfashioned preacher and longing to see
[1:36:10] the old days
[1:36:13] again I've seen so much of this
[1:36:15] impersonation Hollywood glamorizing the
[1:36:18] gospel till I'm sick and tired of it yes
[1:36:21] sir I want to see the oldfashioned
[1:36:23] I'm afraid we're making Christianity too
[1:36:26] pretty for
[1:36:30] people it's a danger
[1:36:35] line you want to be a
[1:36:38] Christian come and
[1:36:42] die he who seeks to save his life will
[1:36:45] lose it but he who seeks to lose his
[1:36:49] life for my sake she'll gain
[1:36:51] it Christianity
[1:36:54] will not make you
[1:36:56] popular you'll not be Big Man on
[1:37:00] Campus you not be the most popular girl
[1:37:03] in
[1:37:06] school I remember carrying my Bible to
[1:37:10] school and one guy told me one time he
[1:37:12] says why you're so weak you have to
[1:37:15] carry your Bible to
[1:37:17] school you have to carry it you can't
[1:37:20] live without it I said no I can't and I
[1:37:22] think I said if you think I'm weak for
[1:37:25] carrying it you carry
[1:37:32] it I love Jesus Christ with all my
[1:37:36] heart and this message made my Bible
[1:37:39] real to
[1:37:40] me he went from three Gods to one
[1:37:44] God his name is Lord Jesus
[1:37:47] Christ and the prophet of God began to
[1:37:49] talk to us about Blasphemous names sir
[1:37:53] and church churches and
[1:37:55] harlots and all of this church system he
[1:37:58] said I'm not against the people right he
[1:38:01] said I'm against the system because it's
[1:38:04] Antichrist and this Antichrist system
[1:38:07] that's coming in America one day it's
[1:38:10] the word of God she's going to speak
[1:38:12] like a
[1:38:14] dragon and this hatred that you see is
[1:38:16] coming
[1:38:18] up what is it brother Bram said to the
[1:38:21] foolish virgin they're going to be
[1:38:22] martyred
[1:38:24] and he said the 144,000 martyred Moses
[1:38:28] and Elijah
[1:38:32] martyred it's dripping with
[1:38:36] blood it's dripping with
[1:38:40] blood this Holy Ghost
[1:38:44] Gospel is dripping with
[1:38:47] blood
[1:38:49] amen I hold this message dear to my
[1:38:53] heart
[1:38:55] I
[1:39:00] do and this
[1:39:04] sermon hear ye him Middletown
[1:39:09] Ohio the scripture was of no private
[1:39:13] interpretation it was wrote by the Holy
[1:39:16] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is the only
[1:39:19] one who can reveal it amen for it is hid
[1:39:24] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:39:26] and it's revealed to babes such as we
[1:39:29] learn so if you don't watch if you don't
[1:39:32] use the mind of the Holy
[1:39:37] Spirit to put it together you'll have
[1:39:41] your scene all mixed up for instance
[1:39:43] like a cow picking grass in the top of a
[1:39:47] tree that's just about the way some of
[1:39:50] it is looks now I remember you know when
[1:39:54] you go to search the message for certain
[1:39:57] quotes I searched for hours one time I
[1:40:00] know brother Bram said a cow on top of
[1:40:03] the tree eating
[1:40:06] grass he never said it he said picking
[1:40:11] grass you got to put in the right
[1:40:15] word I've never made that mistake have
[1:40:18] you ever seen a cow pick grass
[1:40:25] but that's just as Kentucky hillbilly
[1:40:27] you ever seen a cow on top of the tree
[1:40:29] picking
[1:40:30] grass so it depends on how have any of
[1:40:33] you ever researched certain quotes that
[1:40:36] you knew brother Braham said you go to
[1:40:38] and you can't find it and you search it
[1:40:40] this way and that way and finally when
[1:40:42] you find it oh just one
[1:40:45] word amen God help us to have the whole
[1:40:49] counsel of
[1:40:51] God now watch watch this Jesus said
[1:40:54] except a man be born of water and of the
[1:40:56] spirit he will no wise enter into the
[1:40:59] kingdom the picture looks ridiculous but
[1:41:03] the only way that we could find it is by
[1:41:07] revealing the Holy Spirit first in US
[1:41:10] receiving the holy spirit in
[1:41:13] us then he teaches us the truth and the
[1:41:17] life he will never disagree with the
[1:41:21] word he's always on the word so if the
[1:41:24] spirit now watch him now discern
[1:41:27] something so if the spirit in you says
[1:41:30] that the days of Miracles is passed it's
[1:41:34] not the Holy
[1:41:39] Spirit if you believe that Jesus is
[1:41:43] changed in the years that's gone by if
[1:41:46] that Spirits in you says that then it's
[1:41:50] not the Blessed Holy Spirit
[1:41:54] let me just throw some others out there
[1:41:57] if the spirit in you tells you it's okay
[1:41:59] for a woman to cut her hair it's not the
[1:42:02] Holy
[1:42:04] Spirit
[1:42:06] am God's holy spirit only vindicates his
[1:42:11] word the Bible says without Holiness no
[1:42:14] man shall see God now the Holiness we
[1:42:17] have is not something we put on but it's
[1:42:20] something that we receive you receive
[1:42:23] the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:42:26] sisters when you receive that revelation
[1:42:28] of Jesus Christ of Holiness to you do
[1:42:31] you know what you do you put on
[1:42:34] Holiness you put away immoral clothes
[1:42:37] now if it is a Creed or a dogma and
[1:42:40] that's all you've been taught then
[1:42:43] you're like a cookie
[1:42:45] cutter and for years you did what
[1:42:47] everybody else did but there come a time
[1:42:49] when you're going to go and say that's
[1:42:52] not me that's not for
[1:42:58] me so I don't want us to be
[1:43:02] just making
[1:43:05] people adhere to a
[1:43:09] certain yeah to conform to
[1:43:14] religion you young girls that are
[1:43:16] sitting right
[1:43:17] here I could come down and get in your
[1:43:20] face and I could say I'll tell you what
[1:43:22] don't you ever wear some memoral dress
[1:43:25] like this and I could scream and yell
[1:43:27] and get all mad and you know what it it
[1:43:29] might frighten you but is that going to
[1:43:30] hold
[1:43:38] you which one of you are going to be
[1:43:42] next walk
[1:43:44] away which one of your
[1:43:47] parents there ain't just nothing to it
[1:43:51] walk away from it
[1:43:53] do you know that we are in the most
[1:43:56] deceptive time this world has ever
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:00] seen my heart breaks because many
[1:44:05] times the ministry is blamed for the
[1:44:10] people because they walk away well when
[1:44:13] they walked away from Jesus was it
[1:44:15] because his ministry wasn't good
[1:44:21] enough I want to ask you
[1:44:24] all of you that are Bible
[1:44:27] readers when did Jesus
[1:44:30] counsel newly married
[1:44:34] couples when did he take the young
[1:44:37] people and counsel the
[1:44:40] youth do you know what his counsel
[1:44:44] was the word of God that he
[1:44:49] preached so don't blame it on well we
[1:44:51] should have had a youth meeting we
[1:44:52] should should have had these and this
[1:44:54] and that and and blame it on our youth
[1:44:57] ministers yeah you guys ain't preaching
[1:44:59] hard James come
[1:45:02] on aren't you guys good
[1:45:19] enough sometimes as a pastor
[1:45:30] I do I see Lord I'm I'm not good
[1:45:33] enough I can't I can't preach it good
[1:45:39] enough why do people walk
[1:45:43] away why do people forsake
[1:45:46] it because it hurts

[1:56:08] Father Here I
[1:56:11] am in another
[1:56:14] Babylon your Prophet said in so many
[1:56:18] places oh America here we are
[1:56:23] in Babylon once
[1:56:25] again we see all of the things around us
[1:56:30] Lord we see the pressures coming upon
[1:56:33] the
[1:56:36] people we see people giving up walking
[1:56:42] away and when they did Jesus said will
[1:56:44] you go
[1:56:47] also where could we
[1:56:49] go I ask you where are are you going to
[1:56:52] go to find something better than what
[1:56:54] we've
[1:56:57] got or if you want to go somewhere where
[1:56:59] it makes you feel good and you can live
[1:57:01] any kind of
[1:57:03] life this church is not for you it's not
[1:57:07] I would
[1:57:08] admit but if you're as serious as I
[1:57:12] am that you want to do all that you can
[1:57:15] to serve god with a ferency and with a
[1:57:19] passion not with lip service
[1:57:22] but with your whole heart oh God I pray
[1:57:25] that you will bless each and every one
[1:57:27] oh God here we stand in the midst of
[1:57:30] this modern day
[1:57:32] Babylon I do not look to Trump I do not
[1:57:36] look to our
[1:57:37] government I do not look
[1:57:41] to the inflation to get
[1:57:44] better prices to go down gas to go down
[1:57:48] and we have many years of plenty no it's
[1:57:51] going to get
[1:57:52] worse and
[1:57:55] because even the current President
[1:57:58] Biden is putting in current laws right
[1:58:02] now that is going to bring a taxation
[1:58:05] upon the people and things because he's
[1:58:08] going out and he's got to do it before
[1:58:11] he goes out of
[1:58:12] office so father regardless of all of
[1:58:16] this

[1:58:22] position of President and Vice
[1:58:24] President that's immaterial because

[1:58:30] thus sayith the Lord she's Bound for
[1:58:33] judgment kabot is written over the it's
[1:58:37] written on the walls Lord and so father
[1:58:40] I
[1:58:41] pray help us Lord as your servants to to
[1:58:50] stand to do all that we can
[1:58:52] again father I thank you I praise you I
[1:58:55] ask that you'll be with us I pray in
[1:58:59] Jesus Christ's
[1:59:01] name amen musicians go ahead and if you
