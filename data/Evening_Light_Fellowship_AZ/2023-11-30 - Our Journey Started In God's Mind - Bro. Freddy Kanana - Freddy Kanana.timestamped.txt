[28:38] just flip open our
[28:42] Bibles I
[28:44] know all of us as
[28:48] uh human beings we can flip the pages of
[28:52] this Bible and turn and open it and look
[28:56] at it and read but it takes the Lamb of
[28:58] God to come and give us the content
[29:00] that's right shall we start with
[29:03] Ephesian chapter 1 verse
[29:09] 3-9 let's
[29:17] read blessed be the God and the father
[29:21] of our Lord Jesus Christ who have
[29:24] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[29:29] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[29:32] as he has chosen Us in him before the
[29:36] foundation of the world thank you Lord
[29:39] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[29:42] before him in love amen having
[29:45] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[29:48] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[29:53] according to the good pleasure of his
[29:55] will Amen to the praise of the glory of
[29:59] his grace wherein he hath made us
[30:03] accepted in the
[30:05] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[30:09] through his
[30:10] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[30:14] to the riches of his grace wherein he ha
[30:19] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[30:23] Prudence having made known unto us the
[30:26] mystery
[30:27] of his will according to his good
[30:30] pleasure which he had purposed in
[30:34] himself amen also can
[30:37] we read
[30:41] in Galatians
[30:45] chapter
[30:55] 2 verse 20
[31:01] Galatians chapter 2:20 I am crucified
[31:04] with Christ nevertheless I live yet not
[31:08] I but Christ liveth in me and the life
[31:12] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[31:16] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[31:20] and gave himself for me
[31:23] amen the last scripture is going to be
[31:26] Luke
[31:27] chapter
[31:30] 10 verse
[31:38] 20 not withstanding in this Rejoice not
[31:42] that the spirits are subject unto you
[31:46] but rather Rejoice because your names
[31:50] are written in heaven Hallelujah may the
[31:53] Lord add the blessings to the reading of
[31:55] his word as you have your seats
[32:04] I felt kind of keep continuing with the
[32:06] little subject that I started last
[32:08] time our journey started in God's mind
[32:12] amen that's the sermon but for the
[32:15] subject I prefer to go with from your
[32:19] book of life to the Lamb's Book of Life
[32:26] amen
[32:29] as I said last time our journey as
[32:31] Believers especially as the Bride of
[32:33] Jesus Christ didn't start here on Earth
[32:35] when we were born amen our journey
[32:38] started in the mind of
[32:41] God because the Bible says the lamb was
[32:44] slain before the foundation of the
[32:49] world in his mind bar bam
[32:55] says we made a a
[32:57] choice because we had the free moral
[33:01] agency between the tree of life and the
[33:03] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but
[33:07] in his mind we made our choice to go for
[33:11] the tree of life
[33:13] amen so he
[33:16] knew who would Cho made a make a choice
[33:19] of the tree of life and who make a
[33:21] choice for the tree of the knowledge of
[33:23] evil and
[33:24] good but for those that have made the
[33:28] choice to go for the tree of life he
[33:31] decided first to write down their names
[33:35] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[33:39] Hallelujah and the lamb has to give
[33:43] himself as a sacrifice to die for this
[33:45] one that had made a choice for the Tree
[33:48] of
[33:52] Life butam says in the message questions
[33:56] and answer number four preached in
[34:00] 1964 uh August the
[34:02] 30th let's read
[34:06] that notice a mother she can
[34:10] be ever so mean and cruel but just
[34:14] before that baby is born there's a
[34:17] certain kindness that sits in did you
[34:21] ever notice a mother when she's to be
[34:24] mother there's something sweet about her
[34:27] she always takes she always take on that
[34:31] sweetness it's because that little angel
[34:34] Little Spirit a little Messenger to this
[34:37] little Tabernacle is ready to come forth
[34:40] into the
[34:42] world and then when this little angel
[34:45] comes into the body that's a little
[34:48] angel of the earth a spirit that's
[34:53] ordained of God to take this body
[34:58] then that baby has to have a
[35:02] choice it makes its
[35:05] decision then when it takes and then
[35:09] when this takes place then you see the
[35:13] angel of the Lord now comes in in here
[35:17] which is the spiritual body the Eternal
[35:21] that
[35:22] Eternal this is a dying spirit in a
[35:25] dying body but now you cannot you can't
[35:29] be in two bodies at one time but there
[35:33] there can be two Natures in you at one
[35:37] time now the nature of this Spirit of
[35:41] the Lord when you are born again you are
[35:44] not born of physical like the baby was
[35:49] but what happened the spiritual Birth
[35:52] has come to you thank you Lord and while
[35:54] the spiritual birth is growing into your
[35:57] heart of of God there is a physical or a
[36:01] Celestial body growing to receive that
[36:05] spirit and when the life leaves this
[36:08] body it goes to that body amen just as
[36:12] when the body is presented to the Earth
[36:16] the spirit comes in and when the spirit
[36:19] goes out of this body there is a body
[36:22] waiting Hallelujah for we know that
[36:26] after this Earthly
[36:28] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[36:32] already waiting see that's it the
[36:36] spiritual body of the
[36:38] people so here bam was trying of
[36:42] answering this question was trying to
[36:44] show that when we come here on this
[36:48] Earth there's a
[36:51] spiritual there's a spirit I meant to
[36:53] say there's a spirit which is Earthly
[36:56] spirit that was ordained by God to dwell
[36:59] in the body as soon as he's
[37:01] born this is an Earthly
[37:04] spirit that comes into this
[37:08] body and he says at a certain
[37:11] point this child will have to make a
[37:14] choice which means will be placed
[37:18] exactly like in the mind of God placed
[37:21] between the tree of life and the tree of
[37:25] knowledge of Good and Evil
[37:30] and if you have noticed it
[37:33] when this Spirit comes in the body
[37:36] there's a
[37:37] life a life
[37:42] started but this Earthly spirit in this
[37:46] Earthly body they are naturally against
[37:50] the word of
[37:54] God that's how you start living your
[37:58] life until the choice is presented to
[38:02] you to make whether you're going to be
[38:05] with the tree of life or the tree of
[38:07] knowledge of evil and good but until
[38:11] then you'll be living your life that's
[38:14] the book of your life that is being
[38:18] written and Bam says when were born cu
[38:21] the little children one time they were
[38:24] brought to Jesus and he said when the
[38:27] disciples was trying to prevent them
[38:28] from being brought to him he said don't
[38:30] prevent them from coming to me see
[38:34] because brother bam says they they don't
[38:38] have the sin of their own they still
[38:41] little so if they die between that age
[38:45] they go straight in heaven amen because
[38:48] they don't have a sin to repent
[38:55] for and then
[38:57] then when you start growing up whatever
[39:00] life until you reach the age of
[39:03] accountability like bam says and if you
[39:06] have noticed the devil is imitating the
[39:09] the god most of the
[39:12] time you go in the book of uh in uh
[39:15] Psalms
[39:17] 90 the prayer of
[39:20] Moses he's talking about our
[39:24] lives God has given us the time to live
[39:26] until 7 years and for the strongest one
[39:31] they go un
[39:32] 80 and God always take the the the
[39:35] thighs of everything we have in our
[39:37] lives even of our life here on the earth
[39:41] that's why that first time that first
[39:43] time we are the the first uh years of
[39:46] our life before we reach that the the
[39:48] age of
[39:49] accountability God doesn't count that
[39:52] amen that's why the devil you see can
[39:55] you take the the the the compact CD when
[39:58] he plays the first part is
[40:01] blank and then start recording and at
[40:04] the end is blank
[40:06] again that's the devil imitating the
[40:09] Lord amen so when you reach that
[40:13] age they start recording all the deeds
[40:16] in what whatever you say your voices
[40:18] your mind and everything they start
[40:20] being
[40:21] recorded until when you reach or
[40:29] you have the choice to make between the
[40:31] tree of life and the tree of knowledge
[40:34] of Good and
[40:37] Evil each and every one of us we went
[40:40] through this
[40:43] process at certain point of life you be
[40:48] presented you be given a chance to make
[40:51] a choice of which tree you be go with
[40:57] let's read brother bam
[41:00] in Souls that are in prison now
[41:05] 1963 October
[41:07] 11th he says
[41:09] this now The Souls of man is not the
[41:13] body of man it's the soul and the soul
[41:17] is something that is the nature of the
[41:20] spirit and then when the nature of a man
[41:24] when he said we are
[41:27] the scripture plainly tells us we are
[41:29] dead and our lives are HID in God
[41:33] through Christ sealed there by the holy
[41:35] spirit amen now I wasn't now it wasn't
[41:39] that your body died it wasn't that it
[41:43] wasn't your spirit died it was the
[41:46] nature of your spirit died see the
[41:49] nature which is the soul the nature of
[41:52] your soul is God if you are born again
[41:57] if it's not it's of the
[42:00] world anything that begins has to end so
[42:04] therefore the only way that you can have
[42:07] eternal life is to have a life that
[42:11] never did
[42:13] begin and then your life did begin when
[42:16] you were
[42:17] born when God breathed the breath of
[42:21] life into your
[42:23] nostrils and you became a living soul
[42:26] then you begin
[42:28] then but when you that nature that was
[42:32] in You by Nature
[42:34] you of the
[42:39] world
[42:40] alienated from God you were actually an
[42:44] animal that's exactly right anyone knows
[42:47] that we are mmal amen how many knows
[42:50] that we are M we are a warm-blooded
[42:55] animal but but that is what we are by
[42:58] our Earthly
[42:59] creation but you see what made us
[43:02] different from other
[43:05] animals was that God put a soul upon
[43:08] us now the other mammals don't have to
[43:12] wear
[43:13] clothes no other animals has to wear
[43:16] clothes to heed his shame but us we are
[43:21] the only ones that does because we have
[43:24] a soul but see God in the beginning knew
[43:28] what a man would be like and he created
[43:32] the Earth and brought up all kinds of
[43:35] animals from every lowest to the highest
[43:39] and the highest animal come forth was a
[43:42] man
[43:46] amen we can
[43:49] take Paul of
[43:51] old Paul lived his life was born as all
[43:55] human being having the Earthly Spirit he
[44:00] lived his
[44:02] life until that day when he was
[44:05] persecuting the uh Christians when the
[44:08] pillow of fire met with
[44:10] him telling him why are you persecuting
[44:14] me so when he met God he made a
[44:18] choice because the tree of life was
[44:21] presented to him amen he made a choice
[44:24] to believe and to go with the Tree of
[44:25] Life
[44:26] he left that place and went to Saudi
[44:31] Arabia searching the scriptures and he
[44:34] understood that Jesus Christ is the same
[44:36] yesterday today and
[44:42] forever let's read in Philippians and
[44:45] see what I didn't give the scripture to
[44:47] the brothers to project
[44:54] it
[45:03] Philippians chapter
[45:07] 3 from verse 7 until verse 9 this is
[45:11] Paul saying after he was
[45:14] converted but what things were gained to
[45:18] me those accounted loss for
[45:22] Christ yeah
[45:24] dless in account all things but loss for
[45:28] the Excellency of the knowledge of
[45:31] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[45:35] suffered the loss of all things and do
[45:39] count them but
[45:41] D that I may win
[45:45] Christ and be found in him not having my
[45:49] own mind own righteousness which is of
[45:53] the law but that which is through the
[45:57] Faith of Christ the righteousness which
[46:00] is of god by faith
[46:04] amen you see Paul lived his life with
[46:08] the humanistic Spirit or the Earthly
[46:11] spirit that was in him he lived his life
[46:13] and the Book of his life was written
[46:15] butam says for those of you who are
[46:19] dreaming when you dream which means a
[46:22] part of you was
[46:23] somewhere you say otherwise
[46:26] your memory can could not record it
[46:30] because that's the reality because a
[46:31] part of you was
[46:32] somewhere the same way as we are living
[46:35] our natural life here everything we do
[46:38] in our conscience in our or in our
[46:40] subconscious are recorded in our
[46:43] memory that's the book our book of life
[46:46] amen that's why baram when he was making
[46:48] discernment was going into different
[46:50] realm into different dimension he could
[46:53] see what went through in your life amen
[46:56] who could read your book of
[46:59] life that's your spirit is a human being
[47:03] Earthly spirit that dwelt in this body
[47:06] that made you live that
[47:09] life but
[47:14] now after that you will be given a
[47:20] chance this is now we're going to talk
[47:22] about the book of
[47:23] Lamb's life
[47:27] so when you receive
[47:28] Christ that's how he comes in you like
[47:32] bam says that baby has to have the
[47:35] Natural Spirit or Earthly Spirit at a
[47:38] certain point an angel of the Lord a
[47:41] Celestial by the celestial spirit will
[47:43] come that's when they are born again
[47:46] amen and
[47:48] now after you lived your
[47:51] life which is mostly against God's word
[47:56] but as after you make your choice of the
[47:59] tree of life
[48:02] then God himself will start living his
[48:04] own life through you amen that's why
[48:08] Paul says
[48:10] here it's not me living but it's Christ
[48:15] in me living amen so now we're going
[48:17] from your book of of life to the Lamb's
[48:20] Book of
[48:24] Life
[48:37] if your name was not written in this
[48:40] Lamb's Book of Life there's no way
[48:43] absolutely no way you can
[48:46] live the life of Christ
[48:51] amen because God has to come in your
[48:53] life to live his own life life butam
[48:56] says it's not you it's not your
[48:57] righteousness but this is his own
[49:00] righteousness it's him living his own
[49:03] word in you thank you
[49:06] Lord butam says here
[49:11] in forsaking all
[49:15] 1962 the 23rd of
[49:17] January Jesus said or the scripture
[49:22] says he that loves the world and the
[49:25] things of the world the love of God is
[49:28] not even in him that's
[49:31] right it takes forsaking
[49:35] all there when you were willing to
[49:38] forsake all and follow him then if you
[49:43] abide in me and my words abide in you
[49:46] you can ask what you will and it will be
[49:49] done for you amen but you cannot knowing
[49:53] that those things are wrong
[49:56] you know they are wrong the Bible says
[49:59] against them card playing cigarette
[50:01] smoking drinking wearing you moral
[50:04] clothes and then claiming to be
[50:07] Christian if that spirit in you does not
[50:10] condemn that then there's something
[50:14] wrong with the spirit that is in you
[50:17] amen because the God who wrote the word
[50:20] is the word
[50:22] amen and the word is in you yeah and it
[50:26] condemns you it's got
[50:30] to and it doesn't and if it doesn't you
[50:34] are being deceived amen so here let me
[50:37] let me make some comment
[50:39] here that's why in this same time the
[50:42] light that we have received the message
[50:44] that we have received is the true
[50:46] message from God is the true light but
[50:50] sometimes people are walking in false
[50:53] conception of this True Light
[50:55] amen you want to make sure you have the
[50:58] right conception of this true light that
[50:59] have come to
[51:02] us how can the Holy Spirit write
[51:05] something and you turn around and do
[51:09] contrary to it and say the holy spirit
[51:12] is leading you you can't do it right so
[51:16] smoking cigarettes drinking whiskey
[51:19] playing cards cutting hair wearing
[51:21] shorts and all these other things are
[51:24] wrong sinful wrong and you'll never get
[51:27] anywhere until you quit it
[51:30] amen that's creeping into our
[51:32] Pentecostal move shame on you you ought
[51:36] to be
[51:37] ashamed no wonder we can't have a
[51:40] worldwide Wonder we can't have a
[51:43] Pentecostal Revival Something's
[51:47] Happened that's right we've laid down
[51:50] the bars amen things are taking place
[51:54] that shouldn't take
[51:56] Place therefore you must forsake
[52:00] all to follow Christ you must forsake
[52:03] your own ideas you must cope with this
[52:07] word and never will the holy ghost ever
[52:11] deny any
[52:13] word it ever spoke that's right and the
[52:16] Bible is wrote by the Holy Spirit the
[52:20] Bible said so and if the Bible the Bible
[52:24] the Bible word
[52:26] is God in the beginning was the word the
[52:28] word was with God and the Word was God
[52:32] and the Word was made flesh
[52:36] amen and dwelt Among Us Now word is made
[52:41] Spirit dwelling in
[52:43] us for I will be with you even in you to
[52:49] the end of the world the consum the
[52:51] consum cons
[52:54] consummation
[52:56] now if that same God that wrote the
[52:59] Bible is in you you're not your own you
[53:03] are de to the things of the world you
[53:05] are de to your own
[53:08] thoughts and the mind that the mind that
[53:10] was in Christ be in you there then you
[53:14] are forsaking all to follow him not your
[53:18] own
[53:19] thoughts what he says not my will thine
[53:23] Lord then you begin
[53:25] to line up with God's word could stay
[53:29] there a long time but will just run on a
[53:34] little
[53:35] father but you say what do I get then
[53:39] forsaking all forsaking
[53:43] all you
[53:46] see the Young Rich
[53:49] ruler but the bom says he was
[53:53] young he was strong
[53:56] handsome he had whatever he was like an
[54:00] well of man he had
[54:02] money he didn't have any need of
[54:04] anything cuz that's what most people are
[54:06] looking for amen but he was lacking one
[54:09] thing he realized he was walking with
[54:12] the false conception of the True Light
[54:15] he realized he didn't have eternal
[54:17] life which you and I have tonight thank
[54:20] you Lord we can have what he had but for
[54:24] him to have what we have stough
[54:28] hallelujah what he had most people are
[54:31] running working hard to get you know to
[54:35] where he was right to stay young
[54:39] healthy handsome beautiful whatever name
[54:42] it have more money he had it
[54:47] right but he didn't have what we have he
[54:49] didn't have eternal life amen he came
[54:52] but whatam says to the right person
[54:55] that's right the tree of life was
[54:58] presented to
[54:59] him he made a choice the the Earthly
[55:02] Spirit was in him all this
[55:05] time making money looking beautiful and
[55:08] handsome and everything
[55:09] else but when he got to make his choice
[55:12] of the tree of
[55:14] life he could
[55:17] not he's supposed to forsake all amen
[55:21] most people they want
[55:23] to collect whatever
[55:25] have at the same time walk with God no
[55:28] it's not going to work that
[55:29] way when he made a choice of Abraham he
[55:32] told him because before God start with
[55:35] Abraham he had a covenant which was
[55:37] conditional Covenant with Adam and Eve
[55:41] if you do this I will do this if if if
[55:45] and a righteous God and a sinful man
[55:48] that could not get along with that
[55:50] Covenant that's right man was falling
[55:53] all the time and God made a a change
[55:58] that's why when he called Abraham he
[56:00] told him you're not going to do
[56:02] nothing I will do everything Hallelujah
[56:06] just on you you you just have to believe
[56:08] what I done
[56:11] already that's unconditional
[56:16] Covenant you don't have to do
[56:19] nothing so the Young Rich
[56:22] ruler looking at his wealth looking at
[56:26] everything he was like no I'm not going
[56:27] to do what you're asking me to do
[56:30] forsaking
[56:32] everything and most people are and
[56:34] brother bam says when Jesus looked at
[56:36] him the Bible says he loved
[56:40] him and butam say he must have a good
[56:43] spirit you get it good
[56:47] spirit nothing wrong he knew the
[56:50] Commandment of God cuz most people they
[56:51] believe having a good spirit right
[56:56] coming to
[56:57] church doing everything else is good I'm
[56:59] going to heaven no no no no you don't
[57:03] have to have the false conception of the
[57:05] True
[57:06] Light he had it amen he came to the
[57:10] right person he asked the right
[57:12] question he received the right answer
[57:16] but he took a wrong decision
[57:20] amen and I believe tonight you guys
[57:22] didn't take a wrong decision thank you
[57:25] Lord
[57:27] amen that's why this message has come to
[57:30] take the Amnesia away to take the
[57:32] confusion away we want to make sure that
[57:36] we have the true conception of the True
[57:38] Light amen
[57:41] otherwise we be deceiving ourselves
[57:43] that's
[57:45] right that's why at a certain time we
[57:48] leave our lives we have our own Book of
[57:51] Life whatever deed we did our our
[57:55] thoughts and everything we have done in
[57:56] our lives there's a
[57:59] book but at a certain time when we
[58:03] receive Christ that's how God himself
[58:05] comes in us he will come to live in us
[58:09] to write his own
[58:11] book praise the Lord you go in Old
[58:15] Testament you can pick up Moses David
[58:19] all of them they live the life of Christ
[58:22] at certain
[58:23] point
[58:25] at a certain time you live your life but
[58:28] it has to come a time where God has to
[58:30] live his own life in you
[58:33] amen let me tell you
[58:37] something in the mind of God when you
[58:40] made your
[58:41] choice to go with the Tree of Life God
[58:45] put the name or your name in the Lamb's
[58:48] Book of Life
[58:51] Hallelujah he put you in the
[58:53] book
[58:56] but the book at certain time the book
[58:58] has to be in you that's
[59:00] right we'll get to there I don't want to
[59:03] get ahead of
[59:11] myself and This Book of
[59:14] [Applause]
[59:19] Life butam says in
[59:23] the
[59:25] in Gabriel's Gabriel's
[59:29] instruction Gabriel's instru
[59:31] instructions to Daniel
[59:33] 1961 the 30th of
[59:36] July now we found that he was a Kingsman
[59:42] Redeemer and he took the book out of the
[59:45] hand of original
[59:48] owner it is a title deed to
[59:52] Redemption we found that
[59:56] you remember that study it's a title
[59:58] deed of redemption it's an abstract deed
[1:00:01] with it that God required life for
[1:00:05] death in the Garden of Eden then Jesus
[1:00:09] the righteous one died and took a little
[1:00:12] a title deed and was able to break the
[1:00:16] seals reveal what was in
[1:00:19] them and give the inheritance that
[1:00:23] belonged to him to his people eternal
[1:00:27] life that he inherited by doing that he
[1:00:30] passed his own life back out at Calvary
[1:00:35] and divided it among us but the Holy
[1:00:38] Ghost amen amen thank you Lord no man
[1:00:41] has never been able to even think of the
[1:00:44] love that
[1:00:46] was that that was what he done
[1:00:52] Satan the one's possessor because he
[1:00:56] because of the fall in in in at Garden
[1:00:59] is
[1:01:01] bound is bound and cast into the Lake of
[1:01:07] Fire he says our his days are
[1:01:11] finished Jesus in gospel had four
[1:01:15] titles we C that son of David he to the
[1:01:21] throne son of Abraham the Royal Grant
[1:01:24] son of man heir of the earth Son of God
[1:01:30] heir to All Things the Royal

[1:01:40] years it could not be annihilated from
[1:01:43] its original honor but 50
[1:01:47] years and on that 40th day he paid the
[1:01:50] price on the 50th day the Redemption and
[1:01:54] the power that belonged to the church
[1:01:58] that was lost in the Garden of Eden was
[1:02:01] redeemed back and send to us by the
[1:02:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost on the 50th
[1:02:07] day let me say something here so you
[1:02:10] know the me like I said the message we
[1:02:13] have received is not like
[1:02:15] a the message of a man it's a message
[1:02:18] that have come from God himself
[1:02:21] am the same God that at the Pentecost
[1:02:25] day who have come down in the form of
[1:02:29] pill of fire and divided himself and
[1:02:32] dwell and hung over the disciples is the
[1:02:35] same God that has come in this end time
[1:02:37] amen if we had camera on that day would
[1:02:40] have taken the picture of exactly the
[1:02:42] same py that we're seeing today amen
[1:02:45] that py was on the top of each one of
[1:02:50] the disciples you see brother bam on the
[1:02:53] top of William brandham
[1:02:56] at a certain point he said this pill of
[1:02:58] fire is coming is dwelling is getting
[1:03:01] into my
[1:03:02] body that's why Paul says it's not me
[1:03:04] living but it's Christ in me living
[1:03:07] through this body
[1:03:12] amen we picked up the
[1:03:14] Scrolls how that the
[1:03:17] scroll was handed into his hands how
[1:03:21] that Jeremiah in Jeremiah 32:6 his
[1:03:26] cousin Haniel left him some
[1:03:31] ha and they was going into
[1:03:34] captivity which we are going into with
[1:03:38] him this morning
[1:03:41] captivity and it was kept in an Earthly
[1:03:46] vessel there's something here that is
[1:03:48] very deep shows where the power of God
[1:03:53] and the Scrolls
[1:03:55] and the secret of God is known in the
[1:03:58] heart
[1:04:02] amen is I said in God's mind you made
[1:04:07] your choice God put your names in the in
[1:04:11] his book The Book of Lamb's
[1:04:17] life that's why
[1:04:21] when John was weeping after he heard the
[1:04:24] voice saying who is
[1:04:27] worthy to take the book and to loosen up
[1:04:30] the
[1:04:30] seals and nobody was found in heaven on
[1:04:34] the earth nobody was found and John wept
[1:04:39] butam say why John wept because nobody
[1:04:42] was found and if there's nobody found to
[1:04:44] lose the seals and the whole nature and
[1:04:47] the whole creation was be it has to be
[1:04:50] lost right and John remember when he was
[1:04:52] on the earth Jes Jesus told them don't
[1:04:55] Rejoice because of the spirits are
[1:04:57] subject to you but Rejoice rather that
[1:05:01] your names are written in the heaven
[1:05:05] where in the Lamb's Book of
[1:05:07] Life for Us that's our
[1:05:11] joy right we can't Rejoice for
[1:05:15] anything Miracles and things yes it's
[1:05:18] good those are the blessings of the
[1:05:20] children but we need to Rejoice because
[1:05:22] our names are written in the Lamb's Book

[1:05:45] One Time by uh Hebrews people they came
[1:05:48] to him who are you tell us who you are
[1:05:52] his name was John of course
[1:05:55] what did he say I'm the
[1:05:59] voice speaking in the
[1:06:02] wilderness that's his name and that was
[1:06:06] written before the foundation of the
[1:06:07] world was there and when the time of
[1:06:10] fulfillment has come John recognized his
[1:06:13] name in the book
[1:06:16] hallelujah our names are written in the
[1:06:18] form of mysteries right when the
[1:06:20] Mysteries are revealed in this end time
[1:06:23] you know when the call you you turn
[1:06:25] around because they call your name

[1:07:31] names showing that showing it shows
[1:07:34] where the power of God and the the
[1:07:37] Scrolls and the secret of God is known
[1:07:40] in the
[1:07:42] heart this is exactly what Jeremiah
[1:07:45] did he left those books with his cousin

[1:07:52] Earth this is the earth too
[1:07:54] amen amen this
[1:07:58] book that has been handed to the mighty
[1:08:03] angel in Revelation

[1:08:11] mind of God you were put your names or

[1:08:50] leadership of the holy spirit thank you
[1:08:52] Lord Revelation chapter 10 we can read
[1:08:56] chapter 10: 2 and we're going to read
[1:08:57] verse
[1:09:00] 7 no verse 8 uh to 11 let's read verse
[1:09:06] two and he had in his hands we're
[1:09:09] talking about a mighty
[1:09:10] Angel a little book open and he set his
[1:09:15] right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:09:18] foot upon the
[1:09:20] Earth that book that he had in his hand
[1:09:24] that's the same that's the Bible this is
[1:09:26] the title
[1:09:29] deed the mighty Angel has that book a
[1:09:31] little book was open not closed
[1:09:35] open let's go down on verse 8 of the
[1:09:39] same same chapter
[1:09:41] 10 and the voice which I heard from
[1:09:45] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:09:49] and take that little book which is open
[1:09:52] in the hand
[1:09:54] of the Angel which stand which standeth
[1:09:57] upon the sea and upon the
[1:10:01] Earth he said and I went unto the angel
[1:10:05] and said unto him give me the book give
[1:10:07] me the little book and he said unto me
[1:10:11] take
[1:10:12] it and eat it
[1:10:15] up and it shall it shall make thy belly
[1:10:20] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth so
[1:10:23] sweet is
[1:10:25] honey and I took the little book out of
[1:10:28] the Angel's hand and ate it
[1:10:32] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:10:36] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[1:10:40] was
[1:10:41] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:10:44] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:10:49] Nations and tongs and Kings amen but but
[1:10:53] bam says John represented the
[1:10:56] bride which we are he had to go take
[1:11:00] that little book from the hands of the
[1:11:02] mighty Angel take it and the angel says
[1:11:05] take it and eat it
[1:11:06] up he says it was sweet in my mouth when
[1:11:10] they preaching the Mysteries they are
[1:11:11] preaching all the Mysteries revealed in
[1:11:13] this end time you rejoice your amen amen
[1:11:17] but as soon as it gots into your Bly you
[1:11:20] become
[1:11:21] bitter which means when it comes to
[1:11:24] apply or to leave that word out stuff
[1:11:27] that's right the Bible the word of God
[1:11:30] tells you to forsake
[1:11:31] all oh no it's
[1:11:34] tough but when the preach the mystery
[1:11:36] amen we go to heaven and
[1:11:39] things leave it out tough Bitter Sweet
[1:11:43] in your mouth sweet when you listen to
[1:11:48] it but this book we can
[1:11:51] track the trip of this book
[1:11:54] book but abam says the original owner of
[1:11:57] this book is God
[1:12:02] himself in fact this
[1:12:04] book when it was given I want to give
[1:12:06] you something when it was given to Adam
[1:12:08] or to
[1:12:09] humankind was a spoken word because in
[1:12:13] Genesis God was telling them right you
[1:12:16] will have dominion on the
[1:12:20] earth everything will be under you butam
[1:12:24] says Adam was like an immature God on
[1:12:26] the earth amen when the book was given
[1:12:28] to Adam was in the spoken word form
[1:12:31] right and in this end time when we
[1:12:34] receive this book again it's a spoken
[1:12:36] word
[1:12:41] amen butam says Adam
[1:12:45] lost this book when Satan came
[1:12:49] in lied to them and B says they dirty
[1:12:54] hands of the devil could not hold that
[1:12:56] book for a long time no it has to go
[1:12:59] back in the hands of the original owner
[1:13:01] which is God himself but this book is
[1:13:04] for us for as
[1:13:06] Believers you cannot stay in the hands
[1:13:08] of God because this Earth God gave it to
[1:13:13] us not to
[1:13:15] this human body but to the spiritual
[1:13:19] body in us right because the true us is
[1:13:22] not this right
[1:13:25] because he said he told Adam you're
[1:13:27] going to subdue you're going to have
[1:13:28] dominion on everything that is creeping
[1:13:32] on the earth including this body because
[1:13:33] it's moving too you have to keep your
[1:13:36] body subject to the Holy
[1:13:41] Spirit that's why this book which is the
[1:13:45] title
[1:13:46] deed has to go back to the original
[1:13:48] owner and he's not going to keep it for
[1:13:51] a long time because he need to go back
[1:13:53] back to the human
[1:13:55] being so God kept that book until at
[1:13:58] this end time in uh Revelation chapter
[1:14:01] 5
[1:14:04] where I didn't give that scripture but
[1:14:07] we can just read
[1:14:08] it chapter 5 of
[1:14:14] Revelation let's
[1:14:17] read that's the same thing I was just
[1:14:19] talking about here so chapter 5:3 and no
[1:14:22] man in Heaven Nor in in Earth neither
[1:14:26] under the Earth was able to open the
[1:14:29] book neither to look
[1:14:32] thereon and I wept much because no man
[1:14:36] was found worthy to open and to
[1:14:40] read the book neither to look there on
[1:14:43] even to look at the book nobody was
[1:14:45] found worthy amen and one of the elders
[1:14:48] sayith unto me weep not behold the line
[1:14:51] of the tribe of Judah the Ruth of David
[1:14:55] has prevailed and open the book and to
[1:14:58] lose the Seven Seals
[1:15:01] thereof and I beheld and low in the
[1:15:05] midst of the throne and of the four
[1:15:09] beast in the midst of the elders stood a
[1:15:13] lamp as it had been slain having seven
[1:15:17] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:15:21] spirits of God
[1:15:25] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[1:15:28] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:15:32] him that sat upon the
[1:15:35] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:15:37] The Four beasts and the four and the
[1:15:44] four the Beast and the four and the 20
[1:15:47] Elders fell down before the lamp having
[1:15:50] every one of them Harps and and golden
[1:15:53] vials full of orders which are the
[1:15:56] prayers of the
[1:15:59] Saints you
[1:16:01] see the book was of the original honor
[1:16:05] he gave it to Adam Adam lost it because
[1:16:08] of this the devil that came and begal
[1:16:12] them and God took it back in this end
[1:16:16] time the Lamb of
[1:16:18] God because he's worthy he was slain
[1:16:21] before the foundation of the world and
[1:16:22] he was slain he on the earth he took the
[1:16:26] book out of the one out of the hands of
[1:16:28] the one that was sit in the throne which
[1:16:30] is God Amen and now the book from the
[1:16:33] Lambs ended up in the hands of the
[1:16:36] mighty
[1:16:38] angel from the hands of the mighty
[1:16:40] Angels bam says John represent the bride
[1:16:44] John had to go take that
[1:16:46] book and John took the little
[1:16:49] book what did John uh what did John do
[1:16:51] with the book The the angel told him eat
[1:16:54] it
[1:16:55] up and Bam says it shows where the power
[1:16:59] of God the Scrolls and the secrets of
[1:17:02] God known in the heart amen that book
[1:17:06] has to go in the heart of the human
[1:17:08] being amen was not made to put on the
[1:17:11] shelves when we take the message books
[1:17:13] and we read them no we put them in the
[1:17:16] shelves no we read them we' have to eat
[1:17:18] them up amen amen because the very place
[1:17:21] of this book is in our heart
[1:17:25] amen when when Adam heard this book he
[1:17:29] had Authority on the Earth but abam says
[1:17:33] he could do whatever he could with the
[1:17:35] the the
[1:17:37] Creations you might ask but was was was
[1:17:40] Adam in in the in the mind of God too
[1:17:43] yes cuz the Bible says he named all the
[1:17:47] creatures God send all the animals and
[1:17:51] all the creatures to see what name Adam
[1:17:54] will call them right Adam was calling
[1:17:57] the name of animals God was saying
[1:18:00] amen which means Adam was giving exactly
[1:18:04] the name that was in the mind of God
[1:18:06] that's
[1:18:08] right same ways when the Mysteries are
[1:18:12] revealing to us are revealed to us we
[1:18:14] say Amen because we know we heard them
[1:18:17] somewhere praise the Lord cuz Adam was
[1:18:20] giving the name and God knew that's
[1:18:22] exactly is the name that I had in my
[1:18:24] mind that's why we're saying amen and
[1:18:27] the name by the bottom says it's a
[1:18:28] character
[1:18:32] right let's read the prophet here
[1:18:51] again
[1:18:55] where is that scripture
[1:19:21] go
[1:19:28] whatam says in the Revelation chapter 5
[1:19:32] part
[1:19:33] 1
[1:19:35] 61 was preaching 1961 the June 11th or
[1:19:40] November the
[1:19:42] 6th he said now notice what did we
[1:19:45] lose well it was given to Adam to have
[1:19:48] eternal
[1:19:49] life as long as he ate from the tree
[1:19:53] he had eternal
[1:19:55] life and we notice again that Adam was
[1:19:59] he inherited the Earth he was like an
[1:20:02] amateur God over the
[1:20:05] Earth the Earth was his everything was
[1:20:08] given into his hands he could do with it
[1:20:13] whatever he wanted to he named it he
[1:20:17] called it and he done whatever he wanted
[1:20:20] to he was truly a son of God now in fail
[1:20:25] Adam forfeited it forfeited the title
[1:20:28] deed to that he fored it to Satan Satan
[1:20:32] took the title
[1:20:34] deed Adam was very
[1:20:38] sloly and he did not redeem it he did
[1:20:41] not redeem his right for he could not
[1:20:44] redeem his right but Satan which does
[1:20:47] not rightfully own it but he possesses
[1:20:51] it
[1:20:53] he is the God of this Earth the Bible
[1:20:56] says so he possesses that not because
[1:20:59] that he really rightfully gets it but he
[1:21:04] possesses it now do you get it Satan
[1:21:08] possesses that he holds it in his hands
[1:21:11] death is in his hands the Earth is in
[1:21:14] his hands the world belong to him every
[1:21:18] nation belongs to him he governs
[1:21:23] controls the whole world and everything
[1:21:26] in the
[1:21:29] world in the Gard of Eden before Satan
[1:21:32] came to attempt Adam and Eve when they
[1:21:35] were one in one
[1:21:37] body there was no way Satan could
[1:21:40] deceive them because the bride and the
[1:21:43] bridegroom was one they were in one body
[1:21:47] so after God divided them in different
[1:21:50] body that's how the devil came
[1:21:53] he didn't even come when Adam and Eve
[1:21:55] were together when Adam was
[1:21:58] somewhere he came to the weak part of a
[1:22:00] human being which is his wife and we are
[1:22:04] the
[1:22:04] bride and a woman as long as she's
[1:22:08] married she's protected by her
[1:22:11] husband nobody can come and fool around
[1:22:14] because she's married amen until there's
[1:22:18] separation and anybody can come but as
[1:22:22] long as she's married she's protected by
[1:22:26] her
[1:22:27] husband that's
[1:22:30] why brother bam preached the uh
[1:22:34] invisible Union that's the time we are
[1:22:36] living in we need to be United or
[1:22:39] reunited with our
[1:22:44] husbands cuz when the devil will come
[1:22:47] he's
[1:22:50] confused he doesn't know whether it's a
[1:22:52] is it brother Robert or is he
[1:22:57] God that's why we need to eat the book
[1:22:59] that's why I'm showing you the trip of
[1:23:01] the book amen from original honor which
[1:23:04] is
[1:23:05] God all the way down in our
[1:23:09] heart and when we eat the book that's
[1:23:11] how we get back our title
[1:23:13] deed because all the blessings as Paul
[1:23:16] says here in Ephesians he says he
[1:23:19] blessed us with all spiritual blessing
[1:23:22] in Heavenly
[1:23:24] places didn't start here started over
[1:23:28] there we are predestinated to
[1:23:33] that in predestination bam says it
[1:23:36] doesn't mean you can do whatever you
[1:23:37] want no
[1:23:39] no cuz the Bible says if you do the
[1:23:41] things of the world you love them the
[1:23:43] love of God is not even in you amen you
[1:23:46] have to show that you were there
[1:23:51] right so I hated Jacob I
[1:23:56] love Jacob did whatever he
[1:23:59] could to get the right the the birth
[1:24:03] right you don't have to live all kind of
[1:24:05] life and ex one day expect one day to go
[1:24:08] in heaven right
[1:24:13] no and the whole world belongs to
[1:24:18] him now in this end
[1:24:21] time this title dat this
[1:24:25] book has come to
[1:24:28] us and the only
[1:24:31] way the lamb can live his own life in us
[1:24:36] it's when we receive this book in US
[1:24:40] amen otherwise it's going to be our life
[1:24:43] continuing we will just living our book
[1:24:45] of life will be
[1:24:47] continuing we don't want to be walking
[1:24:49] in deception or in a false con
[1:24:52] conception of the True
[1:24:55] Light that's why the final destination
[1:24:58] of this book it in US
[1:25:05] amen we were in the book that's why
[1:25:09] Jesus said on that day you will know
[1:25:12] that I'm in my father my father is in me
[1:25:16] I'm in him and I'm I'm in you you in me
[1:25:20] this day amen now you know where he came
[1:25:24] from from before the foundation of the
[1:25:26] world when you made that choice your
[1:25:27] name was written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:25:30] Life which means at some point you leave
[1:25:32] your life at some point the lamb when
[1:25:35] you accept him he come in your life
[1:25:37] leave his own life through the body of
[1:25:40] the flesh Paul said
[1:25:43] it it's not me living it's Christ in me
[1:25:49] amen and if it's him in you yes
[1:25:53] you're not going to walk in false
[1:25:54] conception of his light you can't walk
[1:25:57] and do
[1:25:58] anything except to be him leading you
[1:26:02] no because that's him living his own
[1:26:06] life in you
[1:26:08] amen now that you are in the book and
[1:26:12] the book has to be in
[1:26:14] you you see the final resting place of
[1:26:17] the book
[1:26:19] Amen in our hearts amen
[1:26:22] right it's not a closed book it's an
[1:26:25] open book that's right and we all of us
[1:26:28] were able to see our names we heard our
[1:26:31] names being
[1:26:32] called all the
[1:26:35] Mysteries and what one them shows how
[1:26:38] the the the book was was um rolled up
[1:26:41] was like Scrolls like
[1:26:43] this when Jeremiah heard
[1:26:46] it and baram says that's how the seals
[1:26:50] were that's how this book
[1:26:54] was and now when the lamb took the book
[1:26:56] has to loosen the seals to see the
[1:26:59] Mysteries inside
[1:27:01] right and the lamb which is Christ
[1:27:04] himself has to open the seventh seal
[1:27:08] first for you to see the first seal the
[1:27:11] seventh seal has to be open because was
[1:27:13] the first the sixth I mean the seventh
[1:27:16] the six the fifth the fourth the third
[1:27:18] second and
[1:27:20] one so which mean means he has to unveil
[1:27:25] himself the Mighty God
[1:27:29] unveiled among us he has to reveal
[1:27:33] himself we are living in the time where
[1:27:36] everything is open I mean if God himself
[1:27:38] can reveal
[1:27:40] himself how much more all of us that's
[1:27:43] why he says the book is open and the
[1:27:45] books are open the books of Our Lives
[1:27:49] that's why bar was saying holding the
[1:27:52] prayer line he says if you have a sin
[1:27:55] that you did not confess do it now
[1:27:57] because if you come here you'll be
[1:27:59] exposed which means books are opened
[1:28:02] that's right our books of our lives are
[1:28:04] opened when you read this message we are
[1:28:08] exposed because the lamb himself
[1:28:11] unveiled himself now we see even the
[1:28:14] devil is unveiled we see where he
[1:28:17] started and where he's going that's
[1:28:20] right the book is open
[1:28:22] and then when he unveils himself start
[1:28:24] opening all the rest of the seals that's
[1:28:27] how we saw the first seal second third
[1:28:29] what happened Y and we heard our
[1:28:32] names aren't you glad you heard your
[1:28:35] name oh
[1:28:37] Hallelujah aren't you glad you you are
[1:28:39] the one to receive this open book in
[1:28:43] your heart but you're not going to keep
[1:28:46] it with in you just say like that no you
[1:28:48] have to prophesy to because it says
[1:28:58] chapter 10 of Revelation he say it
[1:29:04] says verse 10 no let's take verse no
[1:29:08] start verse
[1:29:09] 10 chapter 10 verse 10 of uh Revelation
[1:29:13] he said and I took the little book out
[1:29:15] of the Angel's hands and ate it up and
[1:29:19] it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:29:23] and as soon as I had eaten up I had
[1:29:26] eaten it my belly was
[1:29:29] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:29:34] prophesy again before many people in
[1:29:39] Nations and tongues and Kings amen not
[1:29:43] only prophesy preaching you can leave it
[1:29:45] out your
[1:29:47] life because the lamb the book is in
[1:29:50] you
[1:29:52] our our bridegroom is in US
[1:29:55] amen we're not separated no more of our
[1:29:58] bridegroom where the devil can come and
[1:30:01] do all kind of things on us when he
[1:30:04] approaches us he's
[1:30:06] confused he look at you but in
[1:30:09] you our bridegroom isn't there
[1:30:13] amen this is the invisible
[1:30:17] Union this is the time we have to be
[1:30:19] United with our
[1:30:20] husband
[1:30:24] we're not
[1:30:25] widows our husband has
[1:30:28] come this is the time of
[1:30:31] marriage cuz you live by yourself you
[1:30:34] are
[1:30:35] vulnerable very good you are
[1:30:38] exposed you are like a a wife without
[1:30:41] husband and any man can come and play
[1:30:44] around with you but when you are
[1:30:47] together when the book is in you because
[1:30:49] you were in the book now the book is in
[1:30:51] you yeah the enemy will be confused
[1:30:55] that's why when he was approaching Jesus
[1:30:58] cuz God was made flesh when he was
[1:31:01] coming he was confused sometimes tell us
[1:31:03] openly are you
[1:31:08] Christ if he was confused then he has to
[1:31:11] be confused today
[1:31:13] amen but for that to happen we need to
[1:31:16] receive the book eat it
[1:31:19] up not in our mind but bam says in our
[1:31:22] heart that's where the secret that's
[1:31:25] where the Scrolls has to dwell why in
[1:31:27] our
[1:31:28] heart might close with this
[1:31:32] one because in our subconscious that's
[1:31:34] where our power
[1:31:37] lays not in our mind cu the body has
[1:31:40] five senses the spirit have five senses
[1:31:43] but the only
[1:31:44] sense which is the the
[1:31:48] subconscious that's where the power
[1:31:50] comes from
[1:31:52] because something that comes from your
[1:31:54] subconscious is unconscious when it
[1:31:56] comes
[1:31:58] out we you we we heard a lot about
[1:32:01] addiction people being addicted with
[1:32:02] this and that but we need to be addicted
[1:32:04] with the word of God Amen to the point
[1:32:06] where if you can't eat it you are
[1:32:08] restless you need to eat
[1:32:11] it that's the kind of addiction we
[1:32:14] want eat it
[1:32:17] up so in in your subconscious that's
[1:32:20] where your power is
[1:32:22] the devil is not powerful that's
[1:32:27] right you heard people like oh he sold
[1:32:29] his soul to the
[1:32:31] devil of course he sold his soul to the
[1:32:34] devil because the devil for him to do
[1:32:37] but what I'm saying is the spirit if he
[1:32:39] doesn't have a body to use it's going to
[1:32:42] be
[1:32:44] powerless if people have sold their
[1:32:46] souls to the devil we need to S to sell
[1:32:48] our souls to God Amen amen you know when
[1:32:52] you
[1:32:53] pray for someone that is not even close
[1:32:56] to you far away maybe in different
[1:32:57] country he's healed and he say that the
[1:33:00] same time I was praying cuz your soul
[1:33:03] you P out you were pouring out your soul
[1:33:05] you were praying for
[1:33:07] him from your soul that somebody was
[1:33:11] healed same way God from someone's soul
[1:33:15] that he's been sold to the devil
[1:33:17] diseases and the curse are going to you
[1:33:21] know
[1:33:23] to other people because somebody sold
[1:33:25] his soul to the
[1:33:27] devil in the same way you pray
[1:33:30] somebody's healed in the same way people
[1:33:32] are sold selling their soul to the
[1:33:36] devil you see so the final place for the
[1:33:40] book is in your heart amen my prayer
[1:33:43] tonight is take the book eat it
[1:33:47] up for you to be one with your
[1:33:50] bridegroom that has come
[1:33:52] amen that way the devil cannot fool
[1:33:55] around with
[1:33:56] you because you are married this is the
[1:33:59] invisible
[1:34:01] Union let us confuse the enemy amen when
[1:34:06] he
[1:34:07] comes is this what r or no it's him but
[1:34:12] it's not
[1:34:14] him because the husband is in his soul
[1:34:17] amen at some point he says Paul I know
[1:34:21] Jesus I know who are you because they
[1:34:24] didn't have a husband in them
[1:34:27] right let's stand to our
[1:34:35] feet shall we
[1:34:38] pray father we are so thankful
[1:34:41] that even though we prepare the service
[1:34:44] we prepare the sermons and we think in
[1:34:47] our little mind that we can say it or
[1:34:50] however we want to say it but it takes
[1:34:52] you to come you the Lamb of God and to
[1:34:54] open the book and to reveal and to say
[1:34:57] it the way you want it to be
[1:34:59] saved father I believe this little
[1:35:02] message it's a blessing to someone
[1:35:04] tonight yes even to myself oh God may
[1:35:08] you cause us to go home and be pondering
[1:35:11] upon this Bible this book that we have
[1:35:13] received in this end time an open book
[1:35:15] not a closed book help us to eat it up
[1:35:19] to become one of this book
[1:35:21] yes
[1:35:23] Lord this is the final resting place of
[1:35:26] this book in our hearts in our
[1:35:29] souls you did not intended this book to
[1:35:33] stay in your hands you not intended it
[1:35:35] to be in the hands of the devil forever
[1:35:38] but this book this title did was
[1:35:42] for
[1:35:43] Adam and his
[1:35:47] offsprings we are the seeds of
[1:35:50] Adam this book has come back to us oh
[1:35:53] God and we want to eat it up even though
[1:35:56] sometimes it's uh bitter when it comes
[1:35:59] to apply it but we ask for your mercy to
[1:36:03] help us yes leave it out oh
[1:36:06] God it's not our righteousness it's your
[1:36:10] righteousness we do not depend on our
[1:36:12] abilities but we depend on your
[1:36:14] abilities yes Lord we want you to come
[1:36:16] down in our lives and leave your own
