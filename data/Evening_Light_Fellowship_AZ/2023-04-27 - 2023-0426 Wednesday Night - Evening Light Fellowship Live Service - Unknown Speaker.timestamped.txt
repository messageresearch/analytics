[19:12] um MRI today that report was supposed to
[19:15] be read on Monday
[19:17] so we we waited real patiently you know
[19:19] how easy that is so just trust in the
[19:21] Lord and hey we'll wait till Monday and
[19:23] we were sitting in uh down where we
[19:26] could look out the window as we waited
[19:27] for his MRI to be over and his nurse
[19:29] she's 40 something years as a nurse
[19:32] there in the ankh department just a
[19:34] great great woman just God bless her
[19:36] nurse Annie comes through and sees us
[19:38] hey how are you guys doing well we're
[19:40] doing good and she said uh Hey I've seen
[19:43] the Mr had been ordered we knew you were
[19:44] here and that report's not supposed to
[19:46] be read till Monday she said if we get
[19:48] that report today I'll have Dr Mangum
[19:51] where I will reach out and give you any
[19:53] updates that we could see
[19:55] um hey that'd be great so they called
[19:57] this evening and she said how you guys
[19:58] doing so we're doing good she said are
[20:01] you going to be doing better
[20:03] praise the Lord
[20:05] and she said I just want to let you know
[20:07] we can already see a shrinkage in the
[20:10] tumor and for a low progressing tumor
[20:13] that is uncharacteristic the goal was
[20:15] for it not to get larger is
[20:17] uncharacteristic for this type of tumor
[20:19] to shrink so we want to thank the Lord
[20:32] be man he's mindful he's faithful he's
[20:35] more than able and he's doing her work
[20:37] even in little Theo's Life as a
[20:39] testimony that he's a living Christ and
[20:40] he's still a Healer he's on the scene we
[20:43] also want to remember Sister Rebecca
[20:45] page as she's still going through her
[20:47] treatments sister Jackie Fielding I know
[20:49] it had an MRI and just praying the Lord
[20:52] be mindful of her situation
[20:54] my brother Ron's going to come and take
[20:55] the knees and give an update on brother
[20:57] Neil Mater we want to continue to
[20:59] remember also little Josiah McGrady and
[21:03] uh
[21:04] brother Paul Chua is traveling
[21:07] um
[21:08] and then we also have a prayer request
[21:10] here for a brother
[21:11] Christensen
[21:13] Chris Peterson I'm sorry prayer request
[21:15] he was in Florida I think they put the
[21:17] prayer request out for me and had the
[21:18] heart attack in Florida but he lives in
[21:20] Washington so trying to get him rehabbed
[21:22] enough and he can't walk right now so
[21:24] try to get him rehabbed enough to get
[21:25] him flown home so I imagine that's
[21:27] pretty it's a pretty terrible situation
[21:29] to be out of state be stuck like that
[21:31] but you know what God's a way maker and
[21:34] so let's just sing That's How Great Is
[21:36] Our God and we'll have a pastor come and
[21:39] just take these needs before the Lord
[21:42] amen if you have a need
[21:44] challenge you to hold it before the Lord
[21:46] As we sing this just tell them how great
[21:48] he is and watch what he can do for us
[21:50] how great is
[21:55] [Music]
[22:01] all
[22:04] and all these
[22:07] [Music]
[22:09] our Grace
[22:14] [Music]
[22:18] the name of the Lord is a strong and
[22:21] mighty town
[22:23] wherein those that need Refuge can run
[22:25] and
[22:27] find Solace and peace in that
[22:30] thank God that we have a cleft in the
[22:33] rock that we can go to
[22:35] for as he is a refuge in a time of
[22:37] trouble
[22:39] have a special prayer request for our
[22:41] brother Neil Mater
[22:43] you know that he's been in the hospital
[22:45] and his hands and his feet
[22:50] tonight if the surgeon can work it out
[22:54] they're going to do surgery on his hands
[22:57] around midnight
[22:59] and probably
[23:01] take the tips of the fingers that have
[23:03] turned black
[23:04] take them off
[23:07] and then tomorrow admit excuse me at
[23:10] midday
[23:12] tomorrow they want to do the surgery on
[23:15] his legs
[23:17] and so we want to have very special
[23:19] prayer
[23:21] for him
[23:22] good
[23:23] he's upbeat
[23:25] he's ready for it he said let's do it
[23:30] and that's a
[23:31] [Music]
[23:33] that's quite a thing just to have the
[23:35] right mental attitude before you go into
[23:37] it
[23:38] but we're praying for him and for sister
[23:42] Karen also
[23:43] because this is a very
[23:46] big undertaking I asked would you like
[23:50] me to come tonight
[23:52] to pray for you
[23:53] uh after the service he said no come
[23:57] tomorrow morning because they're not
[23:58] certain the surgeon has not absolutely
[24:02] said I guess for certain if he comes
[24:04] tonight
[24:06] so yeah unfortunately it's been kind of
[24:09] this way with the hospital and the
[24:12] doctors everybody's uncertain and and
[24:14] this and and that's always
[24:16] unsettling to those the family and the
[24:20] different ones because you really don't
[24:21] know how soon or yes no or
[24:25] so special prayer for brother Neil would
[24:27] all of you if that was

[24:32] wouldn't you want everybody to get real
[24:34] serious about that

[43:45] effect in our lives
[43:48] Lord that when we leave we may be better
[43:50] Christians I pray for the needs that's
[43:53] upon the hearts of your people
[43:55] Lord that you would meet every single
[43:58] one of them
[43:59] for we know father that your word says
[44:02] that if we were to ask
[44:05] for bread would you give us a stone
[44:08] so therefore we know that if we would
[44:11] ask believing in our hearts Lord that
[44:14] you would Grant the very petitions
[44:17] of our hearts and we're trusting in that
[44:19] this evening bless the reading of your
[44:21] word the remainder of the service we
[44:24] give it all into thy hands for thy
[44:26] Kingdom's glory in Jesus Christ's name
[44:29] amen
[44:31] amen praise the Lord thank you musicians
[44:34] if you have your Bibles turn with me to
[44:36] the Book of Luke
[44:38] chapter 8 and we'll read verses 40
[44:42] through 48. we just greet you all this
[44:46] evening in the lovely name of Jesus
[44:48] Christ and we trust that you have come
[44:51] with an expectation upon your heart that
[44:54] perhaps God will say just a few words
[44:57] that might be quickened because we could
[45:00] speak and it would just be words but
[45:02] when we speak by inspiration and the
[45:05] word is quick into our hearts that's
[45:07] when it has an effect in our lives amen
[45:10] Luke chapter 8 verse 40 it says and it
[45:14] came to pass that
[45:16] when Jesus was returned the people
[45:19] gladly received him for they were all
[45:22] waiting for him
[45:24] and behold there came a man named Jairus
[45:27] and he was a ruler of the synagogue and
[45:29] he fell down at Jesus feet and besought
[45:32] him that he would come into his house
[45:35] notice because he had a need in his
[45:37] house
[45:38] Jesus comes when there's needs in our
[45:41] lives
[45:43] for he had one only daughter
[45:46] about 12 years of age and she lay a
[45:49] dying but as he went the people thronged
[45:52] him now I want you to just keep that in
[45:55] your mind that she was 12 years old
[45:57] because we're gonna find out that this
[46:00] this this woman that touches him she has
[46:03] an issue of 12 years and so it's it I
[46:08] believe that God is trying to show us
[46:11] something here about the number 12. amen
[46:14] and it's very exciting
[46:19] and the people thronged him and a woman
[46:21] having an issue of blood 12 years which
[46:24] had spent all her living upon Physicians
[46:27] neither could be healed of any came
[46:30] behind him and touched the border of His
[46:32] Garment
[46:33] and immediately her issue of blood
[46:36] stenched
[46:39] and I don't know if I said that right
[46:42] but that's okay and Jesus said who
[46:45] touched me
[46:46] when all denied Peter and they that were
[46:49] with him said Master the people throng
[46:52] thee and press thee and says Thou who
[46:56] touched me
[46:57] and Jesus said somebody has touched me
[46:59] for I perceive that virtue has gone out
[47:01] of me and when the woman saw that she
[47:04] was not hid she came trembling and
[47:06] falling down before him she declared
[47:08] unto him before all the people for what
[47:10] cause she had touched him and how she
[47:12] was healed immediately and he said unto
[47:15] her daughter be of good Comfort thy
[47:18] faith hath made thee whole
[47:20] go in peace amen you may be seated this
[47:23] evening
[47:27] I would like to continue on with this
[47:31] subject of the great physician is here
[47:33] this is part two and I would like to
[47:35] take for this subject
[47:37] the woman with the blood issue
[47:41] now we find out uh
[47:45] that
[47:46] with this title The Great physician is
[47:50] here
[47:51] and so it's of great importance for us
[47:54] to believe that Christ is actually here
[47:58] and he is here in our midst because the
[48:02] Bible said that they were waiting for
[48:05] him and when he came they received him
[48:08] gladly now there's something about
[48:11] waiting for the presence of the Lord to
[48:14] come in our lives they were waiting in
[48:16] the upper room
[48:18] there's something about waiting it's
[48:20] we're so terrible at waiting for things
[48:23] that we want God to do it and we want
[48:26] him to do it now but God is not a god
[48:30] that is bound by time
[48:33] God is only bound to one thing and
[48:36] that's his word the word he says that he
[48:39] swore he could swear by no greater so he
[48:42] swore by himself so God actually binds
[48:46] himself to the very word of God so if
[48:50] there's anything that we need to have
[48:51] confidence in this evening it is the
[48:54] word of God
[48:57] so it's very important for us to believe
[49:00] that Jesus is not only coming
[49:04] Jesus is not only going to appear to us
[49:07] but he is here in the midst of us
[49:10] because when Jesus is amongst us guess
[49:14] what happens things change
[49:19] Hallelujah
[49:22] we have to realize that he is here no
[49:25] matter how we feel
[49:28] no matter of the emotion or of this
[49:30] sensation or how we feel in our mortal
[49:33] bodies but we have to have faith in God
[49:37] that he's here and he's here because
[49:39] he's the same yesterday today and
[49:41] forever and because he's the same he'll
[49:43] perform the same things that he did
[49:46] throughout the word
[49:52] hahaha
[49:53] we realize that God is not just a god of
[49:56] History who parted the Red Sea in the
[49:59] River Jordan but he is here this evening
[50:02] and God is more than able to accomplish
[50:05] anything that we give for him to do
[50:11] yes Hallelujah
[50:13] the Israelites were given a promise of a
[50:16] land that flowed with milk and honey
[50:19] but we find out that the banks of the
[50:21] River Jordan they were overflowed and
[50:25] and no doubts no doubt there was doubt
[50:28] that came in the Israelites mind they
[50:30] said why would God lead us to this
[50:33] Promised Land why would God lead us to
[50:36] this place when the banks are
[50:38] overflowing it just seems like it's
[50:40] impossible after impossible he led us he
[50:44] led us out and we crossed the Red Sea
[50:46] and it just seems like there's always an
[50:48] issue in my life that I have to overcome
[50:51] it's the issue in our lives that makes
[50:54] us Overcomers because without the issue
[50:57] we would never realize that we were able
[51:00] through God to overcome the issue
[51:03] so don't take your don't set your sights
[51:06] and your eyes upon the Earthly things
[51:08] but keep your eyes set upon the promise
[51:12] of God
[51:15] no doubt they looked at the situation
[51:18] and they murmured within themselves how
[51:21] are we going to cross this River Jordan
[51:24] understand brother Branham said that it
[51:27] was a type of death to self
[51:30] the seed has got to rot before it can
[51:33] bring forth life and so here they were
[51:36] they were at a stage in their lives
[51:38] where they had to die to self
[51:41] before the promise of God could come to
[51:43] pass in their lives
[51:47] I find it very fascinating
[51:49] how that they came to the River Jordan
[51:52] and God just didn't part it
[51:55] why wouldn't he just part it and they
[51:56] could just walk across and it would be
[51:57] all nice
[51:59] there would be no temptation there would
[52:01] be no doubt there'd be none of these
[52:02] things it would just be all perfect and
[52:04] easy and praise the Lord look what God
[52:07] did for us
[52:08] but the River Jordan did not part
[52:11] until the Israelites put their foot in
[52:14] the water
[52:16] when they reacted to the action
[52:20] when they reacted to what was set before
[52:23] them the reaction of God parted the
[52:26] River Jordan understand God is wanting
[52:29] you to get your feet wet he's wanting
[52:32] you to step out by faith and to cross
[52:35] that River Jordan
[52:40] you say well I'm just waiting for God to
[52:42] do it for me no God's waiting for you
[52:44] God's waiting for you to step out by
[52:48] faith and to get wet
[52:53] well I'm just gonna wait I'm just gonna
[52:56] wait
[52:57] God don't want you just to wait like
[52:59] that but God wants you to get in action
[53:06] Hallelujah
[53:10] God is still God
[53:12] but what God is doing is he's waiting to
[53:15] see your reactions to those things that
[53:18] are placed in front of you
[53:22] so how is your reaction
[53:25] how has your reaction been since Sunday
[53:27] Monday Tuesday and here we are now we're
[53:30] on Wednesday
[53:31] how was your reactions been through your
[53:34] daily life
[53:35] has it been a reaction of Faith or has
[53:38] it been a reaction of Doubt has it been
[53:41] a reaction of well this is in front of
[53:44] me but I believe God is more than able
[53:48] or is it a reaction of look what I have
[53:51] to deal with today
[53:54] it's one thing after another guess what
[53:57] you better get happy with it being one
[53:59] thing after another because it's never
[54:01] going to change
[54:03] it's going to be one thing after another
[54:06] one thing after another but it'll give
[54:08] us the opportunity for one Victory after
[54:11] another
[54:12] for another time to overcome after
[54:15] another Hallelujah for another time to
[54:18] exercise our faith
[54:20] time and time and time again
[54:29] now we realize that a lot of people they
[54:31] don't know what the will of God is for
[54:34] certain subjects that's written within
[54:37] the word now we as Believers we can't
[54:40] have faith in something we can't have
[54:43] faith in God until we know what his will
[54:47] is first within the word
[54:49] when we understand what God's will is it
[54:53] gives us the ability to have faith to
[54:56] come before God
[54:59] have you ever heard somebody say well
[55:01] God if it if this be your will
[55:05] the reason we're asking that question is
[55:08] because we don't know what the will of
[55:10] God is
[55:13] now God's will is his word
[55:17] so it's very important for us to
[55:19] understand if we want to know what the
[55:22] will of God is we need to see it written
[55:25] within the word and when we see it
[55:27] written within the word then we can have
[55:30] confidence that we can come before God
[55:32] with a boldness and say God
[55:35] your word says about this certain
[55:39] subject and I am a son and I am a
[55:41] daughter of God and I am approaching You
[55:43] Now by faith because your word declares
[55:47] it
[55:49] you see the difference
[55:51] none of this be your will but God I know
[55:54] what your will is
[55:55] therefore I'm asking by faith in the
[55:58] written word
[55:59] don't forget we're talking about healing
[56:01] once again
[56:03] yeah
[56:06] so in order for us as a body and as
[56:09] individuals
[56:11] for us to realize what the will of God
[56:14] is uh concerning healing we need to see
[56:17] it within the scriptures
[56:21] what good is it yeah I heard a testimony
[56:23] of a person one time
[56:25] this person over here got healed and
[56:27] this person over here got touched and
[56:29] praise the Lord if God can do it for
[56:31] them he can do it for me
[56:34] that's true but you can't anchor your
[56:37] faith in the testimony of another person
[56:40] a testimony of another person can
[56:43] encourage you it can help you along the
[56:46] way it can help build your faith up a
[56:48] little bit but it's not something that
[56:50] you can anchor your faith in the only
[56:53] thing as Believers that we can anchor in
[56:55] is the word of God
[56:58] and when our faith is anchored in the
[57:00] word it doesn't matter what anybody
[57:03] else's testimony is
[57:07] because what would happen if a person
[57:09] was declared healed and then they got
[57:11] sick again
[57:12] and you're basing your faith upon upon
[57:16] what God did for them but all of a
[57:17] sudden they get sick
[57:19] oh my well if if they got sick it's
[57:22] going to happen to me all oh my goodness
[57:24] well maybe it's not and no
[57:28] you see the importance
[57:30] it's good testimonies are good they're
[57:32] wonderful they help us they encourage us
[57:35] but our anchor has got to be within the
[57:39] written word
[57:40] because when we're anchored in the word
[57:42] we will not fail
[57:50] Hallelujah
[57:55] so if I was to ask you the question this
[57:58] evening
[58:00] do you believe that God is still a
[58:02] Healer
[58:04] no doubt a hundred percent of your hands
[58:07] would raise up and you would say yes sir
[58:09] brother I believe that God Is A Healer
[58:12] my next question would be this why do
[58:15] you believe it
[58:18] is it because somebody told you that he
[58:21] is
[58:22] it because of the testimony of somebody
[58:24] else or is it because you see it written
[58:28] within the word I turn the pages from
[58:30] Genesis to Revelations and I see that
[58:33] God is still a Healer
[58:37] because if you believe because someone
[58:40] told you it's the truth when they tell
[58:43] you the opposite you will also believe
[58:45] them and become confused
[58:48] so don't just take somebody's word for
[58:50] it
[58:51] take God's word for it Hallelujah
[58:54] and when we take God's word for it then
[58:56] we can really start believing and asking
[58:59] in faith
[59:07] now you might be saying brother Stephen
[59:11] third pool Ministry
[59:13] we don't we don't need uh we're in no no
[59:16] longer we don't need an healing of the
[59:18] body and and you're you're so far behind
[59:20] and and uh and sure maybe a little bit
[59:24] forgive me for that but I think
[59:26] sometimes we just need a little
[59:28] reminding
[59:29] now what's what's interesting about the
[59:32] third pool is
[59:34] the third poll brought to us a
[59:37] revelation of God that was never given
[59:40] before
[59:42] so when we talk about the third pool and
[59:45] we talk about it being the revealing of
[59:47] the word and brother Branham said it was
[59:50] the the opening the revealing of those
[59:52] Seven Seals that's what the third pull
[59:55] is he said it is the revealing of the
[59:58] word of God and we all said amen because
[1:00:01] we understand that
[1:00:02] so if we take it a little bit further
[1:00:05] now and we say well if it's the
[1:00:07] revealing of the word what is the word
[1:00:10] now the Bible says that in the beginning
[1:00:12] was the word the word was with God and
[1:00:15] the word
[1:00:16] was God so what is this third pull
[1:00:19] Ministry it's a revealing of God himself
[1:00:24] it's a revealing of God that mankind
[1:00:27] never had since the days of the Fall In
[1:00:31] the Garden of Eden up until when the
[1:00:33] seals were revealed and opened
[1:00:37] when you listen to Billy Graham and all
[1:00:40] Roberts and these different men
[1:00:43] very fantastic Godly Man fantastic
[1:00:46] speakers but you never hear these men
[1:00:49] speak on predestination you never hear
[1:00:52] these men speak on things that were
[1:00:55] before and things that are to be and and
[1:00:58] the going the secret going away of the
[1:01:00] church and and all these different deep
[1:01:03] things that we are uh that we understand
[1:01:05] as the bride of Christ
[1:01:10] why weren't they preaching those same
[1:01:12] things because it wasn't revealed to
[1:01:16] them to preach those things
[1:01:18] and so with the revealing of the word
[1:01:21] God has actually been unfolding himself
[1:01:25] in this end time
[1:01:27] he has taken a word that was sealed and
[1:01:30] was bound by Seven Seals and he opened
[1:01:33] it up before our very wandering eyes and
[1:01:37] so now we can see a god before he was
[1:01:40] even god brother Branham says he was
[1:01:42] Elohim
[1:01:44] and we see God condescending and why did
[1:01:48] he can't descend because he wanted to be
[1:01:50] a part of his creation he wanted to have
[1:01:53] a closer relationship with his people
[1:01:56] and he is continue now to unfold his
[1:02:00] mind since there was hidden since the
[1:02:02] foundations of the world
[1:02:07] so it's more than just well yeah the
[1:02:09] word is opened yeah praise the Lord but
[1:02:12] it's actually God
[1:02:14] unveiling and unfolding The Plan of
[1:02:17] Redemption
[1:02:21] what a revelation this message is
[1:02:25] yeah praise God the book is opened but
[1:02:28] he has been doing so much more
[1:02:31] told us things which are things which
[1:02:33] are were things which are and things
[1:02:36] which are to be
[1:02:38] he showed us the the the the the the uh
[1:02:42] the two Spirits working throughout the
[1:02:44] framework of the church
[1:02:46] why would he want to tell us those
[1:02:48] things why would he want to reveal to us
[1:02:50] those things because when we see the
[1:02:52] wrong kind of spirit in the church we
[1:02:54] could recognize it
[1:02:57] it's not just a preaching of church
[1:02:59] history but it's a revelation of the two
[1:03:03] Spirits within the framework to where we
[1:03:06] could say that's not the spirit of
[1:03:08] Christ that's nicolaitanism we need to
[1:03:11] get that out from amongst us
[1:03:13] you see it's just not history but it's
[1:03:16] God revealing something behind it
[1:03:23] Hallelujah
[1:03:26] now we find out that
[1:03:29] when God is revealing himself and he is
[1:03:33] unfolding himself we realize that he is
[1:03:37] not only revealing himself
[1:03:40] but he is revealing everything that is a
[1:03:43] part of him amen
[1:03:46] he is revealing every person and he is
[1:03:50] making it known to every person who was
[1:03:53] in his mind since the foundations of the
[1:03:55] world and he's making it known unto them
[1:03:58] who they are where they came from and
[1:04:01] where they're going
[1:04:05] now brother Branham he said it's very
[1:04:07] important for us to realize who we are
[1:04:10] as Believers and it's very important for
[1:04:13] us to realize our position in the body
[1:04:16] of Christ
[1:04:19] what's so important about it
[1:04:22] because with the understanding of your
[1:04:25] position within the body with your
[1:04:27] understanding of who you are in God's
[1:04:31] word and that you are Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:04:35] there comes along with that an authority
[1:04:41] because how can you have authority when
[1:04:44] you don't know who you are you don't
[1:04:46] know where you came from you don't know
[1:04:48] if you're a part of God or not how can
[1:04:50] you have authority when you don't know
[1:04:52] those things
[1:04:55] but when we realize
[1:04:57] Who We Are when we realize our position
[1:05:01] within the body of Christ it brings with
[1:05:04] it an authority now brother Branham he
[1:05:07] would talk about that little policeman
[1:05:10] and he said a policeman would go out
[1:05:12] here and uh if he wasn't in his uniform
[1:05:14] or anything like that and he tried to
[1:05:16] stop traffic guess what he'd probably
[1:05:18] get run over he don't got no Authority
[1:05:21] he don't got no power over anything why
[1:05:24] because he looks he's just a man
[1:05:29] but when he puts his police uniform on
[1:05:32] when he shows his little badge when he
[1:05:34] begins to toot his little whistle guess
[1:05:37] what a card that's going 50 60 miles per
[1:05:40] hour will come to a halt it's the same
[1:05:43] man
[1:05:44] the same person doing the same thing but
[1:05:48] now he has an authority with him
[1:05:51] when he shows that badge and he shows
[1:05:53] who he is now he's not standing alone
[1:05:56] now he has a full backing of the state
[1:06:00] police now he has the backing of the
[1:06:03] judge now he has the backing of the
[1:06:06] lawyers of the city the same man he has
[1:06:09] no more power than he did before but now
[1:06:12] he has an authority so it is with us
[1:06:16] without knowing our position there's no
[1:06:18] Authority we're on our own we have no
[1:06:21] backing but when we realize who we are
[1:06:23] when we realize there's a work that has
[1:06:26] to be done that God has given us an
[1:06:29] authority over this flesh
[1:06:33] all hail trembles
[1:06:36] our problem is we don't use it enough
[1:06:38] we're too scared to use it we don't have
[1:06:41] faith enough to use it we need to get
[1:06:44] our feet wet and use the authority that
[1:06:47] God has given you
[1:06:49] an authority that we can claim the
[1:06:51] promises of God and stand in faith
[1:06:58] how can I stand by faith
[1:07:01] because I got someone who's backing me
[1:07:07] I got someone who's greater than my
[1:07:09] flesh man
[1:07:10] I got someone who's greater than my
[1:07:13] circumstance I've got the supreme
[1:07:16] authority
[1:07:18] not only is he with me but he's in me
[1:07:21] he's got my back he's got my sides he's
[1:07:25] got my front he's all around us
[1:07:31] you know you have authority over your
[1:07:33] flesh
[1:07:35] you know you can bring that thing under
[1:07:37] subjection
[1:07:40] you know when your flesh is trying to
[1:07:42] tell you to do one thing you can tell it
[1:07:43] to do another
[1:07:45] did you know that you don't have to
[1:07:47] listen to your flesh
[1:07:51] wow
[1:07:53] you mean I don't have to do everything
[1:07:55] and say everything that comes into my
[1:07:57] mind no
[1:07:59] if it's not according to the word let it
[1:08:02] alone
[1:08:06] you mean I have authority over my tongue
[1:08:10] you bet you mean I have authority over
[1:08:14] Envy
[1:08:15] bet your bottom dollar
[1:08:19] God has given you supreme authority
[1:08:24] over this flesh man
[1:08:27] don't be scared to use it
[1:08:30] I want to remind you to use it
[1:08:34] because the more you use it the more it
[1:08:36] works
[1:08:40] the more that we exercise our faith the
[1:08:42] more that we exercise our authority over
[1:08:45] this guy you know
[1:08:48] too many people they want to exercise
[1:08:50] their authority over everybody else
[1:08:55] they want to exercise their authority to
[1:08:58] cast out Devils into these many mighty
[1:09:01] works well let me ask you why because
[1:09:03] they want it all for themselves they
[1:09:06] want the glory for themselves that's why
[1:09:08] it'll never work but when you exercise
[1:09:11] it over yourself first when you help
[1:09:14] yourself first then you can help others
[1:09:22] how can you help somebody with a lustful
[1:09:24] Spirit if you got one yourself
[1:09:28] how can you help somebody that's got an
[1:09:31] issue when you've got the exact same
[1:09:33] issue yourself
[1:09:38] but if we could just learn
[1:09:40] by the word of God
[1:09:42] and realize I have authority over this
[1:09:44] thing this stinking flesh
[1:09:51] we depend too much on this guy
[1:09:55] you lean too much on this guy
[1:09:58] and you know what he does every time you
[1:10:00] lean on him get you in trouble
[1:10:05] why do you want to trust in somebody who
[1:10:07] gets you in trouble every time you trust
[1:10:09] in them
[1:10:10] it's not a good friend to have
[1:10:18] you're all laughing because you know
[1:10:19] it's the truth
[1:10:24] so we realize that God has given the
[1:10:26] bride an authority over these things now
[1:10:31] when we look at the five identifications
[1:10:34] there was an authority that a Son of God
[1:10:38] had over situations that came up in his
[1:10:42] life
[1:10:43] we could look back to the little fishy
[1:10:46] that was given life back when it had
[1:10:49] died
[1:10:50] we realize now watch the authority of
[1:10:54] God
[1:10:55] in a human being
[1:10:58] a little fishy
[1:11:00] what is a little fishy it's it's part of
[1:11:02] it's part of nature it's an animal
[1:11:06] so now what because God is showing us
[1:11:08] something through these identifications
[1:11:10] follow this thought with me the little
[1:11:13] fishy that was given back its life we
[1:11:15] realize that there's Authority given
[1:11:17] over animals
[1:11:20] didn't Adam have complete authority over
[1:11:23] all the animals and over all the fish
[1:11:25] and over all these other things didn't
[1:11:27] brother Branham said that we're going
[1:11:28] back to what Adam had that Jesus Christ
[1:11:31] restored everything that Adam lost
[1:11:34] okay now you're with me now follow these
[1:11:36] identifications
[1:11:39] we realize that brother Branham he spoke
[1:11:41] to the wind he spoke to the storm what's
[1:11:44] God trying to show us that there's an
[1:11:47] authority over nature
[1:11:52] follow along with me
[1:11:55] we realized that there was an authority
[1:11:58] given Over The Souls of men
[1:12:00] sister Hattie writes two boys I give you
[1:12:04] your boys in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:12:07] supreme authority over the souls of men
[1:12:12] we also realized that there was an
[1:12:15] authority over
[1:12:16] healing and sickness within the body
[1:12:21] sister Mita his wife
[1:12:25] she had the tumor well why didn't God
[1:12:28] take the tumor away brother Branham
[1:12:29] prayed for her multiple times
[1:12:32] but when she got on to that operating
[1:12:34] table guess what it wasn't there
[1:12:38] God's timing is always perfect
[1:12:42] so we realize that we have an authority
[1:12:45] now over the sickness of our bodies and
[1:12:49] what is it that gives us that Authority
[1:12:52] it's the third pool the revealing of God
[1:12:56] himself is letting us know that these
[1:12:59] things are under our feet
[1:13:03] part of the third pool
[1:13:08] Hallelujah
[1:13:10] there's one that I'm missing
[1:13:13] I did four of them who's paying
[1:13:15] attention
[1:13:16] squirrels
[1:13:19] bless you brother Emmanuel
[1:13:21] they're squirrels
[1:13:24] what's he showing over what's he what's
[1:13:26] he trying to show us
[1:13:27] he's trying to show us now that there's
[1:13:29] complete authority over the spoken word
[1:13:33] The Souls of man
[1:13:35] nature
[1:13:37] animals healing within our bodies and
[1:13:40] speaking things which were not as though
[1:13:44] they were
[1:13:46] God has given us full authority over
[1:13:50] these things
[1:13:55] so we find out that now what is we find
[1:13:58] out that healing now
[1:14:00] is actually a part of the third pull
[1:14:04] Ministry
[1:14:07] not only of the body
[1:14:09] but a healing of the Mind
[1:14:11] a healing of the spirit a healing of the
[1:14:14] Soul a healing of the Brokenhearted
[1:14:19] because God has unfolded himself
[1:14:22] and he has let us know that he is the
[1:14:25] same yesterday today and forever
[1:14:29] Hallelujah
[1:14:31] he's just made it more clear to us than
[1:14:34] ever before
[1:14:38] now we find that one of the seven
[1:14:40] Redemptive names of Jehovah is Jehovah
[1:14:43] Rapha which means I am the Lord that
[1:14:46] healeth thing
[1:14:48] now this we understand it's an attribute
[1:14:51] of God that can never be taken away from
[1:14:54] him
[1:14:55] it is an eternal attribute of God that
[1:14:58] makes known to us that is made known to
[1:15:01] us through sickness
[1:15:04] so how is God making himself known as I
[1:15:07] am the Lord who heals Thee I am the Lord
[1:15:09] who heals all your diseases because we
[1:15:11] have it in our lives
[1:15:15] and therefore because of this He makes
[1:15:18] himself known and he says oh yeah you
[1:15:20] got something in your heart you got a
[1:15:22] sickness in your life I am Jehovah Rapha
[1:15:26] and I change not I don't change for no
[1:15:29] man I don't change for no pulp I don't
[1:15:32] change for no Creed
[1:15:38] but he is the same
[1:15:40] no there's something that I've started
[1:15:43] to study on and it's very interesting
[1:15:47] brother Branham talks about he said
[1:15:50] if you go out into a field in a dark
[1:15:52] night
[1:15:53] and he said and you go out and you start
[1:15:55] speaking and you start saying let there
[1:15:58] be lights and let there be electricity
[1:16:01] and and I want this field to light up
[1:16:03] and let it happen God and let it happen
[1:16:06] brother Branham said there's enough
[1:16:08] electricity in that field to light up
[1:16:10] that whole field
[1:16:12] he says but what you have to do is you
[1:16:14] have to channel that electricity through
[1:16:17] wires
[1:16:19] there's a channel that has to come in
[1:16:22] order for this electricity that we do
[1:16:24] not see that flows through this world
[1:16:27] that we're living in there's a channel
[1:16:29] that it has to be operated on in order
[1:16:32] for it to work
[1:16:34] he says it's the same thing with God
[1:16:38] you've got to approach God and you've
[1:16:41] got to uh Channel your thoughts and to
[1:16:45] the word and to the will of God
[1:16:48] I think personally that that's our
[1:16:51] problem
[1:16:53] we don't know how to channel it
[1:16:57] we believe that it's the truth we know
[1:17:00] that it's the truth but we lack the
[1:17:02] understanding in how can I Channel my
[1:17:05] faith to God's word in order to bring it
[1:17:08] to pass in our lives
[1:17:12] as far as I've gotten on it
[1:17:15] but I believe that once it begins to
[1:17:17] open up
[1:17:19] that it'll change something in my heart
[1:17:22] especially
[1:17:24] and how we approach and and how we ask
[1:17:27] God for things in our lives
[1:17:29] a lot of the times when we ask we're
[1:17:32] asking a miss
[1:17:34] but if we can Channel it in the right
[1:17:36] direction through the filter of the word
[1:17:38] I believe that God will come on the
[1:17:40] scene
[1:17:44] amen
[1:17:47] so we see that every Redemptive name of
[1:17:49] Jehovah was expressed through Jesus
[1:17:52] Christ
[1:17:54] so it behooves us if we want to know
[1:17:57] uh the characteristics of God
[1:18:00] all we have to do as Believers is to
[1:18:03] look at the Life of Christ
[1:18:05] one thing about Christ is that he hated
[1:18:09] religion he hated religious people and
[1:18:12] he had absolutely no time for it
[1:18:17] God feels the exact same way with us
[1:18:20] he hates religion he hates the
[1:18:23] traditions of man there's only one thing
[1:18:26] and one thing alone that God loves
[1:18:28] and that's faith
[1:18:32] Hallelujah
[1:18:34] now let's read a few scriptures
[1:18:39] Exodus 24 verse 25.
[1:18:42] and ye shall serve the Lord your God and
[1:18:45] he shall bless thy bread and thy water
[1:18:47] and I will take sickness away from the
[1:18:50] midst of thee Exodus 15 verse 26 and
[1:18:55] said of thou will diligently hearken to
[1:18:58] the voice of the Lord thy God and will
[1:19:00] do that which is right in his sight and
[1:19:02] will give ear to his Commandments and
[1:19:04] keep all his statutes I will put none of
[1:19:06] these diseases upon thee which I have
[1:19:09] brought upon the Egyptians for I am the
[1:19:11] Lord that healeth thee what are we doing
[1:19:14] we're reading the will of God concerning
[1:19:17] healing
[1:19:19] Jeremiah 17 verse 14 Heal Me O Lord and
[1:19:24] I shall be healed save me and I shall be
[1:19:27] saved for thou art my praise James 5
[1:19:31] 14-16 as any sick among you let him call
[1:19:35] for the Elders of the church and let
[1:19:37] them pray over him anointing him with
[1:19:39] oil in the name of the Lord and the
[1:19:41] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[1:19:43] the Lord shall raise him up and if he
[1:19:45] have committed sins they shall be
[1:19:48] forgiven him confess your faults one to
[1:19:52] another
[1:19:52] and pray one for another that ye may be
[1:19:55] healed
[1:19:58] so if you want to be healed in your body
[1:20:00] there's a couple of things that you need
[1:20:02] to do you need to confess your faults
[1:20:05] one to another and you need to pray for
[1:20:07] other people
[1:20:10] what a selfless Act
[1:20:13] that though there's a need within our
[1:20:15] own bodies the Bible is telling us to do
[1:20:17] the contrary don't pray for yourself
[1:20:20] don't take self-pity on yourself but
[1:20:23] pray for those who are in need
[1:20:26] that the Lord May heal your body
[1:20:30] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:20:32] righteous man availeth much one more
[1:20:35] scripture Matthew 10 verse 1. and when
[1:20:38] he had called on to him as 12 disciples
[1:20:40] he gave them power against unclean
[1:20:42] spirits
[1:20:43] to cast them out to heal all manner of
[1:20:46] sickness and all manner of diseases
[1:20:51] it is throughout the word of God that if
[1:20:53] you ever had a doubt within your mind
[1:20:55] does God still heal
[1:20:58] there should be no doubts as you search
[1:21:00] the scriptures from Genesis to
[1:21:03] Revelations that he still heals
[1:21:09] you say brother Stephen have you ever
[1:21:11] seen a miracle in your life
[1:21:13] Have You Ever Seen The Lame walk have
[1:21:16] you ever seen the blind giving back
[1:21:18] their lives have you ever seen a miracle
[1:21:21] where something extreme just happened
[1:21:23] and praise the Lord that is amazing
[1:21:26] no I haven't
[1:21:28] but let me declare to you this evening
[1:21:29] that God still opens the blinded eyes
[1:21:33] God still causes the lame to walk God
[1:21:37] still raises the dead God still does
[1:21:39] those things he said brother how do you
[1:21:42] know that because I see it written
[1:21:45] within the word
[1:21:48] brother Branham said excuse me if I get
[1:21:51] the number mixed up he said if I pray
[1:21:54] for a thousand or ten thousand people
[1:21:57] and every one of them died in the
[1:21:59] morning I would still pray for the sick
[1:22:01] why would he do that because his word
[1:22:04] declares it
[1:22:09] so our faith isn't depending upon what
[1:22:11] happens and what doesn't happen but our
[1:22:14] faith is depending upon one thing and
[1:22:17] that's the word of God
[1:22:19] well I haven't seen it performed in my
[1:22:22] life Stephen keep praying and God will
[1:22:24] do it
[1:22:31] so our faith shouldn't be determined
[1:22:34] upon how we feel
[1:22:35] are what we see or what we touch or or
[1:22:38] what somebody else tells us
[1:22:40] but our faith should be anchored in the
[1:22:43] word and the word alone
[1:22:47] that's why the prophet brought us back
[1:22:49] to the word
[1:22:50] he said it time and time again get back
[1:22:53] to the word get back to the word why did
[1:22:57] they have to get back to the word
[1:22:58] because they left the word and when you
[1:23:01] leave the word there's no Authority
[1:23:03] but when you're back upon the word
[1:23:05] covered by the blood
[1:23:08] all things are possible
[1:23:13] all things brother Stephen all things
[1:23:17] there's nothing too difficult
[1:23:22] so what happens if you pray for brother
[1:23:24] Neil and he still has to get his legs
[1:23:26] amputated
[1:23:28] we'll pray for the next person
[1:23:31] humble pray for the next person don't
[1:23:34] fail to see the miracle in brother
[1:23:35] Neil's life
[1:23:41] he was supposed to be dead
[1:23:44] he wasn't supposed to make it he was the
[1:23:46] miracle man he is the Miracle Man
[1:23:53] so don't cast out what God has done in
[1:23:56] his life and the restoration that God is
[1:23:59] doing in his life and the healing that
[1:24:02] God is going to bring in his life
[1:24:06] Hallelujah just because of one little
[1:24:08] thing
[1:24:11] he's a miracle how many of you you can
[1:24:14] say I'm a miracle
[1:24:21] amen Leviticus 15 19-29
[1:24:27] we find out that this woman in our
[1:24:30] opening scripture she had an issue of
[1:24:33] blood now this scripture is going to
[1:24:36] kind of give us a little insight into
[1:24:39] the life of this woman with this Blood
[1:24:42] issue
[1:24:43] of what she dealt with
[1:24:46] and and and and and how much of an
[1:24:48] outcast she actually was in verse 19 it
[1:24:52] says and if a woman have an issue and
[1:24:55] her issue is in her flesh Be Blood she
[1:24:58] shall be put apart seven days and
[1:25:01] whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean
[1:25:04] until the even
[1:25:07] so notice
[1:25:08] a woman
[1:25:09] with the blood issue or her her monthly
[1:25:14] cycle however you want to put it if she
[1:25:17] touches anything or anybody touches her
[1:25:19] that thing is unclean she is unclean
[1:25:22] that person is unclean until even
[1:25:26] and everything that she lieth upon in
[1:25:29] her separation shall be unclean
[1:25:32] everything also that she sitteth upon
[1:25:35] shall be unclean and whosoever touches
[1:25:38] her bed she'll wash his clothes and
[1:25:40] bathe himself in water and be unclean
[1:25:43] until the even
[1:25:45] I'm sure we are all noticing right away
[1:25:48] that this woman was unclean
[1:25:52] she was an unclean person
[1:25:54] why because she had a a continuous
[1:25:57] flowing of blood that could not be
[1:25:59] stopped
[1:26:00] the doctors could not stop it the
[1:26:02] Physicians could not stop it and because
[1:26:05] of this issue
[1:26:07] now she was an outcast in her life
[1:26:11] let's keep reading and if any man lie
[1:26:13] with her at all and her flowers be upon
[1:26:15] him he shall be unclean seven days and
[1:26:19] all the bad were on he lieth shall be
[1:26:22] unclean
[1:26:23] and if a woman have an issue of her
[1:26:25] blood many days out of the time of her
[1:26:27] separation or if it run beyond the time
[1:26:30] of her separation all the days of the
[1:26:33] issue of her uncleanness shall be as the
[1:26:36] days of her separation she shall be
[1:26:39] unclean
[1:26:41] 12 years
[1:26:44] here she was
[1:26:45] an unclean person according to the law
[1:26:48] before the Jewish people
[1:26:52] every bed we're on she lieth all the
[1:26:55] days of her issues shall be unto her as
[1:26:57] the bed of her separation
[1:26:59] and whatsoever she said at the pawn
[1:27:01] shall be unclean as the uncleanness of
[1:27:04] her separation
[1:27:05] and whosoever touches those things shall
[1:27:08] be unclean and shall wash his clothes
[1:27:11] and bathe himself in water and be
[1:27:13] unclean until the even
[1:27:16] no doubt this woman was a Castaway
[1:27:20] from the Jewish community
[1:27:22] and the place where she was raised
[1:27:25] and where she lived
[1:27:28] it wasn't her fault
[1:27:30] it wasn't anything that she had done but
[1:27:33] it was an issue of blood that was upon
[1:27:36] her body
[1:27:38] and she was very aware of what the law
[1:27:41] of God says according to her how she was
[1:27:45] to separate herself
[1:27:47] according to the amount of days that
[1:27:49] this issue would happen
[1:27:52] and we see that for 12 years
[1:27:56] she was unclean for 12 years she had
[1:27:59] this issue for 12 years before the
[1:28:02] people she was unclean
[1:28:05] she was a separated person
[1:28:08] the issue in her life had separated her
[1:28:11] from the people surrounding her
[1:28:15] how many times in our lives does an
[1:28:18] issue come upon us
[1:28:20] and the one thing that it does it drives
[1:28:23] us back from the people of God except
[1:28:27] for us separates us away from the people
[1:28:30] who want to help us the most
[1:28:34] because we're embarrassed or because uh
[1:28:37] whatever the issue may be but whatever
[1:28:39] it is
[1:28:41] it causes us now to take a step back it
[1:28:46] causes us now to stop fellowshipping
[1:28:48] with the very people that want to help
[1:28:50] us
[1:28:51] that's exactly what Satan wants to do in
[1:28:54] our lives he wants to separate you and
[1:28:57] get you away from the flock because he
[1:29:00] understands that a sheep by itself is
[1:29:03] defenseless
[1:29:06] a lot of times with a young person when
[1:29:08] there's sin in their lives
[1:29:09] it'll cause them to separate and pull
[1:29:12] back from the rest of the people within
[1:29:14] the church
[1:29:16] why because they're hiding something
[1:29:18] they're ashamed they're ashamed to get
[1:29:21] around God's people they're ashamed to
[1:29:23] approach them they're ashamed to
[1:29:24] approach God
[1:29:25] don't let sin shame you
[1:29:28] sin will only shame you if you let it
[1:29:30] shame you sin will only shame you if you
[1:29:34] stay away from God if you stay away from
[1:29:37] having a repenting heart
[1:29:42] that's why brother Branham said the
[1:29:44] wonderful thing about David was he was
[1:29:46] quick to repent
[1:29:48] be quick to repent be zealous there are
[1:29:51] therefore and repent
[1:29:54] Hallelujah
[1:30:02] I'm sure I'm sure this woman had heard
[1:30:05] about Jesus
[1:30:06] I'm sure she had heard about all the
[1:30:08] mighty Miracles that he had done that he
[1:30:11] had done throughout Israel and Judea I'm
[1:30:14] sure she had heard about how he spat on
[1:30:17] the ground and he took the mud and he
[1:30:18] applied it to a person's eyes and their
[1:30:21] and their sight was given back and I'm
[1:30:23] sure she had heard about how he told the
[1:30:25] man to pick up his bed and walk and I'm
[1:30:28] sure she had heard about all the
[1:30:30] wonderful Mighty things that God had
[1:30:31] done
[1:30:33] but yet hearing about what Jesus had
[1:30:36] done wasn't good enough for her
[1:30:39] she had to do something about it herself
[1:30:44] foreign
[1:30:47] we find out that can you imagine the
[1:30:50] turmoil that she was going through when
[1:30:51] she heard Jesus was passing by
[1:30:55] I am an unclean person
[1:30:58] I can't be out amongst all the people
[1:31:01] I know he's coming I see I see the
[1:31:03] people I I see the multitude has
[1:31:06] gathered and and but I I I don't know if
[1:31:09] I should or not I I know I can't I
[1:31:11] shouldn't be out amongst the people have
[1:31:14] I touch someone they're going to be
[1:31:15] unclean and how am I going to do this
[1:31:17] can you imagine
[1:31:18] the turmoil that she was going to do
[1:31:20] fighting through those doubts of fear
[1:31:25] and I know that Torah says this and I
[1:31:27] know but there was something that was
[1:31:30] that was gripped and anchored within her
[1:31:33] soul
[1:31:33] that give her a purpose that said I need
[1:31:36] to touch the master
[1:31:40] perhaps she thought if I but touch His
[1:31:42] Garment
[1:31:43] he won't be completely unclean
[1:31:47] because I know if I touch him and I
[1:31:49] approach him if he touches me or I touch
[1:31:51] him we're all going to be unclean and
[1:31:54] I'm just gonna mess everything up
[1:31:58] she had no scripture for what was
[1:32:01] purposed within her heart to do
[1:32:06] there was no scripture that she could
[1:32:08] lay her faith on and say oh thy but
[1:32:12] touch
[1:32:12] the Hem of His Garment I know I'll be
[1:32:15] whole she had no scripture for it no
[1:32:17] priest told her about it no preacher
[1:32:19] told her about it but the Holy Ghost
[1:32:22] he was the one that revealed it to her
[1:32:25] if you do this thing
[1:32:27] have you touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:32:29] you're going to be made whole
[1:32:32] that's what we need we need a sure solid
[1:32:37] foundational faith in God that we know
[1:32:40] he's going to perform his word in our
[1:32:42] lives
[1:32:44] she purposed within her heart all of a
[1:32:47] sudden it didn't matter
[1:32:48] I don't care who I get around I don't
[1:32:51] care who my skirt touches I don't care
[1:32:53] if I gotta push people out of the way I
[1:32:55] gotta get to the master she had a
[1:32:58] purpose within her heart
[1:33:01] we need to have a purpose in our hearts
[1:33:04] I say God
[1:33:05] Don't Pass Me By Lord but I want to
[1:33:07] reach out and I want to touch you by
[1:33:09] faith
[1:33:16] now we find out that the moment that she
[1:33:18] touched him
[1:33:19] she was made completely whole
[1:33:23] she didn't touch him as the others
[1:33:25] touched him
[1:33:26] there was a lot of people that were
[1:33:28] around him they were thronging him they
[1:33:30] were grabbing him they were they were
[1:33:32] pulling on him and no doubt it was it
[1:33:33] was hard for him to get around because
[1:33:35] the people were surrounding him and and
[1:33:38] everybody wanted a piece of him
[1:33:42] but she had something
[1:33:44] that they did not have
[1:33:48] she had something that was revealed to
[1:33:50] her heart
[1:33:51] that it was a faith and a faith which
[1:33:54] caused a virtue to come out of his his
[1:33:57] very body
[1:33:59] he said he touched me
[1:34:02] who did that
[1:34:04] who touched me who was it he's calling
[1:34:06] them out
[1:34:08] and Peter said oh master master
[1:34:11] all the people are touching here
[1:34:13] why why would you say that why would you
[1:34:17] say who touched you he said I perceived
[1:34:19] that virtue husband out of me
[1:34:21] when we reach out and when we touch God
[1:34:23] by faith understand things change
[1:34:26] when we reach out by faith it touches
[1:34:30] the heart of God
[1:34:33] and it causes these great attributes
[1:34:36] that he has within himself now to be
[1:34:39] released upon that believer
[1:34:48] how did she do it she didn't touch him
[1:34:50] by her Earthly senses
[1:34:52] but it was something very Supernatural
[1:35:01] it wasn't something that was drummed up
[1:35:05] it wasn't something that she was told by
[1:35:07] another human being
[1:35:09] but it was something that was personal
[1:35:10] between God and Almighty and her issue
[1:35:14] in her heart
[1:35:19] oh my if we could only touch out Reach
[1:35:21] Out And Touch him huh
[1:35:25] because let me say this Jesus is passing
[1:35:28] by
[1:35:29] We Believe within his word that it says
[1:35:32] if two or more gathered in my name I'll
[1:35:33] be in their midst
[1:35:35] I pray that God now here's something
[1:35:38] that I was thinking about today
[1:35:42] give me a few more minutes here's
[1:35:43] something that I was thinking about
[1:35:45] today was this
[1:35:46] so much of the time we put God in a
[1:35:49] little box
[1:35:50] and we say father I pray that you'll
[1:35:53] move in the church service on Sunday I
[1:35:56] pray that you'll move on the church
[1:35:57] service on Wednesday night I pray that
[1:36:00] you'll do this and I pray that you'll do
[1:36:01] that and that lives will be changed and
[1:36:03] we put God in a little spiritual box for
[1:36:06] Wednesday night and Sunday mornings
[1:36:08] we come to church expecting to hear from
[1:36:11] God become the church expecting God to
[1:36:13] move and expecting God to speak to
[1:36:15] hearts and expecting God to do something
[1:36:17] but there's five more days in the week
[1:36:19] that we forget
[1:36:21] that we can get up in the morning and we
[1:36:23] say father I don't see a change in my
[1:36:26] life but I'm expecting you to move
[1:36:29] he is a God who moves on Monday 24 7. he
[1:36:33] is the god who moves on Tuesday 24 7.
[1:36:37] Wednesday 24 7 Thursday Friday Saturday
[1:36:40] Sunday because he is a God who does not
[1:36:42] sleep nor does he slumber
[1:36:45] the purpose why people are touched in a
[1:36:48] church service is because Faith cometh
[1:36:51] by hearing and hearing the word of God
[1:36:53] and it encourages our faith but if we
[1:36:56] were to encourage our faith throughout
[1:36:59] the rest of the week
[1:37:02] to take time to spend with God ourselves
[1:37:06] to take time to meditate upon his
[1:37:09] promises to take time to meditate upon
[1:37:12] his word
[1:37:13] you might just be driving down the road
[1:37:15] someday and God will touch your body
[1:37:18] no hands laid upon you
[1:37:21] no anointing with oil no nothing why
[1:37:25] because you've been in the presence of
[1:37:27] God
[1:37:28] that's what makes the difference and if
[1:37:31] you're the temple of God hallelujah
[1:37:34] wherever you go God goes with you
[1:37:38] so if we could just have faith the rest
[1:37:41] of the days of the week instead of
[1:37:43] waiting for Wednesday and Sunday
[1:37:47] God might have a little bit more of an
[1:37:49] opportunity to do something in our lives
[1:37:53] don't just box God up for a couple of
[1:37:55] days a week
[1:37:57] amen
[1:37:58] amen
[1:38:00] so we find uh
[1:38:03] so we see this number 12. so we realize
[1:38:06] there's 12 tribes of Israel there was 12
[1:38:09] Tri there was 12 Spies across the river
[1:38:11] Jordan there was there was 12 disciples
[1:38:14] 12 baskets of fragments was taken up
[1:38:16] after feeding the uh the multitude there
[1:38:20] and one of Jesus's Miracles we see as
[1:38:22] you go through scriptures 12 12 12. what
[1:38:25] is the number 12 Got to Do with It we
[1:38:28] know that the number three is is
[1:38:30] perfection and we know that the number
[1:38:32] five is Grace we know that the number
[1:38:34] seven is completion we know that the
[1:38:37] number 50 is Jubilee but what is so
[1:38:39] important about the number 12
[1:38:43] Y-12
[1:38:46] and Investments brother Branham said
[1:38:48] 1963 it's right now midnight science
[1:38:51] says it's three minutes to midnight but
[1:38:54] this might be your Midnight Hour it's
[1:38:57] exactly on the dot 12 o'clock
[1:39:01] 1963.
[1:39:03] midnight stroke for some of you you'll
[1:39:06] either accept it not accept me not
[1:39:09] accept what I said but accept the Full
[1:39:12] Gospel the full power the full Bible
[1:39:15] everything that God says accept it or
[1:39:19] it'll be too late
[1:39:22] he's talking about his 12 minutes to
[1:39:24] midnight and he happens to look at the
[1:39:26] clock and he says wow
[1:39:28] it's 12 o'clock
[1:39:30] what's God trying to show us
[1:39:33] there's something about 12. we're in the
[1:39:35] Midnight Hour
[1:39:38] the first seal 1963 and oh I would have
[1:39:41] absolutely today I hope that people are
[1:39:44] spiritual I would have had a horrible
[1:39:46] mistake on that if it hadn't been about
[1:39:49] 12 o'clock today
[1:39:51] when the Holy Spirit came in the room
[1:39:53] and corrected me on something that I was
[1:39:55] writing down to say the spoken word is
[1:39:58] the Original Seed everything is in
[1:40:00] threes three is a perfect number five is
[1:40:03] the number of gray seven completion 12.
[1:40:08] is worship
[1:40:12] 40 tempted and 50 is the Jubilee the
[1:40:15] very word Pentecost means Jubilee 50c
[1:40:17] and now God in his numerals he's perfect
[1:40:20] in his numerals he's perfect in his word
[1:40:22] he's perfect in his action he's perfect
[1:40:24] in everything because he's a perfect God
[1:40:27] yeah
[1:40:29] the number 12 what does it have to do
[1:40:31] with it has to do with worship
[1:40:36] so here was Jairus and his daughter was
[1:40:39] 12 years old and he puts them within the
[1:40:42] same story there's this girl she was 12
[1:40:45] years old she was a laying dying this
[1:40:47] woman had this issue of blood for 12
[1:40:49] years now the number 12 brother Branham
[1:40:52] said is the number of worship
[1:40:54] so what is he trying to show us about
[1:40:57] these examples as written within the
[1:41:00] scripture
[1:41:02] the greatest need that was in their
[1:41:04] lives they weren't worshiping God they
[1:41:07] weren't at church oh Hallelujah
[1:41:11] hallelujah oh I worship you God life is
[1:41:14] good I'm on the Mountaintop it's
[1:41:17] fantastic I feel the presence of God no
[1:41:20] they were in a valley
[1:41:23] they were in The Darkest Hour of their
[1:41:25] lives
[1:41:27] she had a desperate need that she needed
[1:41:29] to touch Jesus
[1:41:31] jairus's daughter was in a desperate
[1:41:33] need she lay a dying they were in the
[1:41:36] greatest turmoil of their life
[1:41:40] but they were associated with the number
[1:41:42] 12.
[1:41:44] how were they associated with worship
[1:41:48] in a time of their life where it seemed
[1:41:51] that nothing was going right
[1:41:54] there was hurdle after hurdle there was
[1:41:57] just no cure she lay and die and here
[1:41:59] she had this Blood issue
[1:42:02] but yet she was worshiping God almighty
[1:42:07] how were these people worshiping God let
[1:42:10] me tell you why it is extremely simple
[1:42:14] that they were not looking to their
[1:42:16] issues
[1:42:17] they were not looking to their
[1:42:18] circumstances but they were standing by
[1:42:21] faith
[1:42:23] so whenever we stand by faith in the
[1:42:26] word of God it is true worship in the
[1:42:29] eyes of our father
[1:42:31] not just when we sing not just when we
[1:42:34] praise yes it's good it's a sweet
[1:42:36] smelling Savor but when we approach God
[1:42:38] by faith
[1:42:40] a supernatural substance
[1:42:43] that has taken over our Natural Body
[1:42:45] amen
[1:42:47] that's what he requires of us
[1:42:52] the number 12. true worship
[1:42:55] pure worship
[1:42:57] that when he comes by we reach out and
[1:42:59] we touch him
[1:43:03] Hallelujah
[1:43:06] they both operated by faith
[1:43:10] and because they lived their lives
[1:43:11] according to Faith and they approached
[1:43:13] them according to Faith it was true
[1:43:16] worship
[1:43:17] it was a sweet smelling savior in the
[1:43:20] nostrils of God
[1:43:22] so you say brother Stephen yeah I'm
[1:43:25] having an issue and this and that guess
[1:43:28] what you're doing
[1:43:29] you were worshiping God almighty
[1:43:34] he is bringing uh we're an attribute
[1:43:37] worship out of your heart that you
[1:43:40] didn't even know existed
[1:43:45] it's an attribute of God true worship
[1:43:49] and here we are thinking oh my goodness
[1:43:50] it's just when everything's good and
[1:43:52] praise the Lord and and the service and
[1:43:54] oh yeah it was nice and I felt the
[1:43:56] presence of God and everything guess
[1:43:58] what Billy when you were locked up and
[1:44:01] you were praying
[1:44:02] guess what it was
[1:44:06] you were worshiping God
[1:44:08] whether you realized it or not
[1:44:11] there was a sweet smell and savior that
[1:44:13] was coming from Mexico
[1:44:16] from a young American citizen
[1:44:19] and God was well pleased with it
[1:44:24] why because the life was operating by
[1:44:26] faith
[1:44:28] as the musicians come we'll bring it to
[1:44:30] a close
[1:44:32] we realize that your confession is only
[1:44:35] as strong
[1:44:36] as your faith
[1:44:38] and your faith is only as strong as your
[1:44:41] understanding of the will of God
[1:44:45] your confession is only as strong as the
[1:44:49] faith within your heart
[1:44:52] because if you believe you're going to
[1:44:54] confess it
[1:44:58] it doesn't matter what's going on in
[1:45:00] this circumstance it doesn't matter how
[1:45:02] I feel it doesn't matter but my faith is
[1:45:05] telling me that God has already healed
[1:45:08] my circumstance God has already healed
[1:45:11] my body God has already healed my broken
[1:45:13] heart God has already healed my broken
[1:45:16] spirit
[1:45:22] but if your faith isn't there you'll say
[1:45:25] well if God will
[1:45:27] if it be the will of God
[1:45:29] we'll see what happens
[1:45:32] don't plant those seed of Doubt within
[1:45:35] your mind
[1:45:38] but say father
[1:45:40] I believe
[1:45:42] that all things are possible and I'm
[1:45:45] confessing a complete Restoration in my
[1:45:48] life
[1:45:50] you know that it's that it's okay to ask
[1:45:53] God like for that bully
[1:45:57] you know God doesn't mind whenever you
[1:46:00] approach him that way
[1:46:02] because you're approaching him according
[1:46:04] to his word
[1:46:06] [Music]
[1:46:12] God help us
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:16] to put into action what we believe
[1:46:20] they put our feet
[1:46:24] and chilly Jordan's River
[1:46:28] Lord the waters is not parted
[1:46:31] I thought by now by the time we got
[1:46:34] there surely this Promised Land I can
[1:46:37] see it with my own eyes and I can almost
[1:46:39] taste the air
[1:46:42] but there's lies before us
[1:46:45] God is waiting for you to step out by
[1:46:48] faith
[1:46:49] he's waiting for you to get your feet
[1:46:51] wet
[1:46:53] he's waiting for you to make the first
[1:46:54] move
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:57] the woman's confession was that if I can
[1:47:01] only but Touch the Hem of His Garment uh
[1:47:03] uh I'll be made whole
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:07] jairus's confession was if you come and
[1:47:09] pray for my daughter
[1:47:11] she will be made whole also
[1:47:14] even when he got word of
[1:47:16] hey don't bother the master anymore
[1:47:19] she died she she passed it's it's it's
[1:47:22] it's done it's too late uh that just
[1:47:25] just just don't bother him there's
[1:47:27] there's other things that he could be
[1:47:28] doing there's other people
[1:47:30] that he could be saying to
[1:47:33] now notice the faith of Jairus
[1:47:36] when the woman was healed immediately
[1:47:40] he didn't get envious within his heart
[1:47:43] he didn't say well
[1:47:46] he called I talked to him first
[1:47:49] and she took my spot she skipped the
[1:47:51] line she's an unclean woman and that's
[1:47:54] never should have happened and yeah
[1:47:57] [Music]
[1:47:59] but Faith rose up within her heart in
[1:48:02] his heart
[1:48:04] I know yeah she's dead this is this is
[1:48:08] what we've been told yeah okay but Jesus
[1:48:11] said only believe
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:16] oh my
[1:48:18] the sweetest words probably that he ever
[1:48:21] heard I only believe I believe Lord
[1:48:25] help out my unbelief
[1:48:28] these lessons that we can learn within
[1:48:30] the scriptures
[1:48:31] people with a positive confession
[1:48:34] he said oh if I can only get him to my
[1:48:36] daughter I know I know I know that
[1:48:37] she'll be well
[1:48:39] if I can only touch His Garment I know
[1:48:41] it
[1:48:42] I know I'll be made whole let me ask you
[1:48:45] this evening what is your confession
[1:48:49] what is your confession about the will
[1:48:52] of God and what God can do for you in
[1:48:54] your life
[1:48:55] you don't only have to apply this to
[1:48:58] healing but you can apply this to
[1:49:01] anything any circumstance any issue that
[1:49:04] is within your life
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:12] what is your confession
[1:49:15] do you have hope rather than faith
[1:49:20] well I believe God can
[1:49:23] but do you believe that God will
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:28] because when we believe that God will
[1:49:30] God will
[1:49:32] and if we believe that God can sure he
[1:49:35] can but if we never ask and say God I
[1:49:37] know that you will I don't know when
[1:49:40] I don't know how I don't know if it's
[1:49:42] going to be in church I don't know if
[1:49:44] it's going to be at home I don't know if
[1:49:46] it's going to be at work or driving in
[1:49:47] my car or wherever it is I don't know
[1:49:49] where but I know Lord that you will
[1:49:53] and I know that you will because I have
[1:49:56] read your will and I know that what your
[1:49:58] will is therefore I'm hiding your will
[1:50:01] and my heart so that no man can take it
[1:50:04] away from me
[1:50:07] this is God's will concerning me
[1:50:10] this is God's will concerning my issue
[1:50:14] this is God's will concerning my family
[1:50:17] and you cannot take it away from me why
[1:50:20] because it's somewhere that you cannot
[1:50:22] touch it's mine it belongs to me
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:28] and so now when we step out by faith and
[1:50:30] we say God I'm no longer hoping
[1:50:34] I'm not just trusting in you with a hope
[1:50:37] but I'm trusting in you that you will
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:46] Hebrews 10 verse 23 it says let us hold
[1:50:49] fast the profession of our faith
[1:50:52] without wavering
[1:50:55] hold on to it
[1:50:57] hold on to it tightly the confession of
[1:50:59] your faith
[1:51:01] not the confession of the preacher's
[1:51:03] faith not the confession of someone
[1:51:05] else's testimony around you but the
[1:51:07] confession of your faith as an
[1:51:10] individual in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:51:16] let us hold fast this profession
[1:51:20] let me hold on to it tightly let me grip
[1:51:23] it as hard as I can let me trust in it
[1:51:25] that it's going to come and come to pass
[1:51:27] at some time in my life
[1:51:30] and I don't know how I don't know it
[1:51:32] doesn't matter
[1:51:34] who cares how it happens
[1:51:38] you care when it's going to happen
[1:51:41] but when we put our full trust in God
[1:51:43] and we say Lord
[1:51:46] I know it was the blood for me Lord
[1:51:49] and I know that upon calvary's tree you
[1:51:52] were wounded for my transgressions and
[1:51:55] by your stripes I am healed
[1:51:58] and I got to thinking about today
[1:52:01] and I begin to pray and
[1:52:04] I begin to intercess for others
[1:52:08] and I began to say Lord
[1:52:11] don't let it be about me
[1:52:14] but father let Faith rise up in the
[1:52:17] hearts of your believers
[1:52:19] let Faith rise up in my heart
[1:52:23] that I can believe for somebody else's
[1:52:25] need
[1:52:27] that we could pray one for another and
[1:52:30] that by your intercessory prayer that
[1:52:34] that person could be healed and they
[1:52:36] know nothing about it how great and
[1:52:39] wonderful would that be
[1:52:41] he says the Bible says for he is
[1:52:44] faithful
[1:52:46] that promised
[1:52:48] he's so faithful
[1:52:50] that there's not one of his words that
[1:52:52] will pass away
[1:52:53] there's not one of his words that will
[1:52:55] ever fail
[1:52:57] Hallelujah Let's Dance
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:15] we will find he's not too busy
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:53] love and touch the Lord
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:03] you will
[1:54:05] hide his objectives
[1:54:08] [Music]
[1:54:23] Jesus
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:27] Reach Out And Touch the Lord
[1:54:32] [Music]
[1:54:40] that God still moves
