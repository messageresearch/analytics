[19:01] Easter everybody got it
[19:03] say I got it all right no excuse you
[19:07] know it's the week after Easter that way
[19:09] we're not in infringing on others that
[19:12] have always had an Easter meeting or an
[19:14] Easter camp or whatever now we will have
[19:16] a a an Easter Service here for sure yes

[19:20] have us a Time
[19:22] but our anniversary meetings
[19:26] will be April 14 15 and 16. because in
[19:31] March we always had a problem with
[19:32] spring training
[19:33] everybody's in town uh as you know
[19:36] because of the baseball season it's hard
[19:39] to get a motel and if you can get a
[19:41] motel it's twice the price Etc and and
[19:44] uh so we thought well let's just do it
[19:47] into April and we'll have beautiful
[19:48] weather at that time also
[19:52] now I have got some CDs
[19:56] these are made this is called Big
[19:59] stories for little ears this is made by
[20:02] Josh and Anne love all it's a little
[20:05] podcast that they put together a
[20:07] reenactment of Jonah and a whale Noah's
[20:10] Ark and the flood and Sister Ann Reed
[20:13] some of the scripture and then the
[20:15] children acted out it's fantastic I went
[20:19] ahead now these are ten dollars each
[20:21] and I went ahead and I've paid for 20
[20:23] already or I will brother Robert I'm
[20:25] gonna have you I got the note in the
[20:27] back there
[20:31] so he's my right hand man but what we'll
[20:33] do in order so that sister Carolyn and
[20:36] the different ones that there uh don't
[20:38] have to do it in their books and take
[20:40] the money and this will be on the honor
[20:42] System honor System that means if
[20:44] they're in the back we've got about 18
[20:46] of them back there with the brother now
[20:49] uh and if you want one go ahead and take
[20:51] it and then you can put ten dollars in
[20:53] the offering is that fair enough
[20:56] we'll let your conscience
[20:58] okay the honor System because that way
[21:01] the sisters okay they paid me and they
[21:03] hold it and they wait and give it to Ann
[21:05] when we're out of these we'll get more
[21:08] okay so it's really really good and uh
[21:11] you know uh I believe it'll be a real
[21:14] blessing to those especially if you've
[21:16] got young children they will absolutely
[21:18] love to hear these children do that and
[21:21] so it's uh
[21:23] it's definitely something that you
[21:25] should look into
[21:27] um
[21:31] and also an update
[21:33] on brother William Silva's people are
[21:36] asking what about it what you know
[21:38] tomorrow
[21:40] is a date for the lawyers to go before
[21:43] the judge
[21:45] we've sent about I believe if I'm
[21:48] correct about 4 500 US dollars so far to
[21:52] go ahead and get the lawyer for him
[21:55] uh now you all know brother
[21:58] Ernesto Marine there in Monclova Mont
[22:00] Clovis he's a pastor down there he's
[22:03] been here he's preached for us I've gone
[22:05] down there and preached in Mexico he
[22:08] used to work for the governor
[22:10] of his Province so he knows a lot of
[22:13] powerful people in the government and
[22:16] when I contacted him within 15 minutes
[22:19] he said brother Ron I've got a lawyer
[22:22] for you and I know what to do and she's
[22:25] good and she's a Christian etc etc and
[22:28] we've went ahead and he's kind of our
[22:30] middle man to go ahead and handle the
[22:34] things there in in Mexico for us so
[22:37] tomorrow the Lord willing I'd like you
[22:39] guys to remember them in prayer uh
[22:42] they've set the bond at 20 000 pesos
[22:45] that's about eleven hundred dollars
[22:47] we've already sent the money for the
[22:49] bond they're going to pay the bond
[22:50] tomorrow
[22:52] we will find out some people are saying
[22:55] brother Ron uh brother Austin Johnson
[22:57] has had a bunch of people asking he's
[22:59] got a GoFundMe page already ready to
[23:03] launch if we need it
[23:05] okay
[23:06] but you don't want to just start
[23:08] throwing money at something until you
[23:10] know you know um
[23:13] we don't know the expenses we don't know
[23:15] what they're going to find
[23:17] um I and we don't know so we will keep
[23:20] you informed and once we know then we'll
[23:23] probably uh either do a PayPal on our
[23:26] website or we'll do it with uh brother
[23:30] Austin to go ahead and put up a GoFundMe
[23:32] page but we'll keep you informed but
[23:35] tomorrow is a very important meeting
[23:37] it's the first time I think that he's
[23:39] gone before the judge and um so uh let's
[23:44] just keep that as a matter of Prayer
[23:47] and uh so that is all that I have
[23:51] on uh on my announcements of what I
[23:55] wanted to say to all of you so keep
[23:57] those dates ready we will inform you now
[24:01] I've had some of the youth leaders some
[24:04] of my sound technicians and different
[24:06] ones said brother Ron we would like to
[24:08] go and look at the camp at potonto rim
[24:11] to see what what all we need to go look
[24:13] and just get an an idea of uh now so
[24:17] we've got plenty of time we'll look at
[24:20] March April maybe May or whatever to go
[24:24] ahead and go up there and what I'll do
[24:25] is I'll get a bunch of Brothers uh it'll
[24:28] be just some brothers I'll probably take
[24:29] my truck or whatever and we'll all go up
[24:32] together if we have to take a couple
[24:33] cars we will but that way they can go
[24:36] and get a first hand look of what they
[24:40] need for sound and that sort of thing

[32:14] thou being a Jew asketh drink of me
[32:17] which I'm a woman of Samaria for the
[32:21] Jews have no dealings with the
[32:22] Samaritans
[32:23] Jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[32:26] knewst the gift of God and who it is
[32:29] that saith to thee give me to drink that
[32:32] would have asked of him and he would
[32:36] have given thee water
[32:37] the woman saith unto him sir
[32:40] thou has nothing to draw with and the
[32:42] well is deep from when Stan has thou
[32:45] Living Waters
[32:46] are dealt greater than our father Jacob
[32:48] which give us the well and drink thereof
[32:51] himself and his children and his cattle
[32:54] Jesus answered and said unto her
[32:56] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[33:00] thirst again but whosoever drinketh of
[33:03] the water that I shall give him shall
[33:06] never thirst thank you Lord
[33:08] the water that I shall give him shall be
[33:11] in him a well of water springing up into
[33:14] everlasting life
[33:16] the woman saith unto him sir give me
[33:19] this water
[33:21] I could say that we would all be in
[33:23] agreement tonight sir give me this water
[33:26] this is the kind of water that I want to
[33:29] partake of
[33:31] that I thirst not neither come hither to
[33:35] draw Jesus saith onto her go call thy
[33:38] husband and come hither
[33:40] the woman answered and said I have no
[33:42] husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast
[33:46] well said I have no husband for thou
[33:49] Hast had five husbands and he whom thou
[33:52] has is not thy husband in that sadist
[33:55] thou truly
[33:57] the woman saith unto him sir I perceive
[34:00] that thou art a prophet our fathers
[34:02] worshiped in this mountain and ye say
[34:05] that in Jerusalem is the place where men
[34:07] ought to worship and Jesus saith unto
[34:10] her woman believe me the hour cometh
[34:13] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[34:17] nor at Jerusalem notice he's taken away
[34:20] these locations that these people are
[34:22] holding on to he's saying neither in
[34:25] this mountain nor in Jerusalem uh uh not
[34:30] yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye
[34:32] worship ye no not what
[34:35] we know what we worship for salvation is
[34:39] of the Jews but the our cometh and now
[34:42] is when the true worshipers
[34:45] shall worship the father in spirit and
[34:48] in truth for the father seeketh such to
[34:51] worship Him
[34:53] God is a spirit and they that worship
[34:55] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[35:00] truth amen you may take your seats this
[35:03] evening
[35:03] [Music]
[35:08] I would like to continue on with this
[35:11] thought this evening of true worship and
[35:14] this is part 11
[35:16] and I would like to take for the subject
[35:19] in spirit
[35:22] and in truth in spirit and in truth so
[35:26] we pick up our story this evening
[35:29] with a very familiar portion of
[35:31] scripture and we know that brother
[35:33] Branham would use this scripture many
[35:35] times within his ministry either when he
[35:38] was preaching or whenever he was praying
[35:41] for the sick and
[35:43] he would do this with a purpose in mind
[35:46] and that purpose would be that the
[35:49] people would realize that Jesus Christ
[35:51] is the same yesterday today and forever
[35:56] that if Jesus did something within the
[35:59] scriptures that it wouldn't be a far out
[36:03] thing that if he was doing it in this
[36:06] hour day and so here he would he would
[36:08] have somebody come before him and he
[36:10] would say no here is a woman and I am a
[36:13] man and I don't know the needs that is
[36:16] upon your heart I have never met you
[36:18] before is that true and they would hold
[36:20] up their hand and they would say that
[36:22] that that's true and he would say this
[36:24] is uh
[36:26] uh something that has already happened
[36:28] within the scriptures and he would
[36:31] rehearse this scripture so that the
[36:34] people would notice and say my God is
[36:37] doing the exact same thing in this hour
[36:40] day with a Divine gift of God just like
[36:44] he did in Bible times
[36:47] all right
[36:49] and so we realized that uh that this
[36:53] part of brother branham's Ministry was
[36:55] given to him in the second pool of his
[36:59] ministry and now he was backing up his
[37:02] ministry with scriptural examples
[37:05] and so we realized that the that a
[37:07] prophet will always bring us back to the
[37:10] word
[37:12] that's why I love this message
[37:15] it's not something that a man uh on a
[37:19] far a far out country and he and and he
[37:21] had a dream and he did this and he did
[37:23] that and he was all by himself and there
[37:25] was no accountability there was no one
[37:27] else to see it uh it was just his word
[37:29] and his word only
[37:31] but brother Branham now he would take
[37:34] these examples he would share things he
[37:36] would give scriptural examples and and
[37:38] and and and and uh all of it would be
[37:41] scripturally based
[37:43] that's why I put my trust in this
[37:46] message because it's not something
[37:48] that's far out it's scripturally based
[37:50] which is our absolute
[37:55] now within this portion of scripture we
[37:58] can see there's there's many points of
[38:00] reading and many things that we could
[38:02] pull out of it
[38:04] um and expound on but I would like to
[38:07] speak on like I've already said on what
[38:10] it means to worship God in spirit and in
[38:15] truth because the Bible says that God is
[38:19] seeking man
[38:20] that he might worship Him
[38:24] it's God that's doing the seeking he's
[38:26] not just seeking for a for a little bit
[38:29] of uh uh raising our hands once in a
[38:32] while and a little bit of singing a
[38:34] little bit of worship no he wants us to
[38:36] worship him in a peculiar way in spirit
[38:39] and in truth
[38:41] you can't have the one without the other
[38:43] it's not accepted in God's mind
[38:47] but so what's he doing in this end time
[38:49] now he's seeking those how many of you
[38:52] can say I'm one of those I'm one of
[38:55] those that He sought after I'm one of
[38:57] those who he caught in this end time
[39:00] sure
[39:02] so now we we can read in our Bibles in
[39:06] verse 20 and it says of John chapter 4
[39:10] and it was the woman here speaking and
[39:13] she says our fathers worshiped in this
[39:15] mountain
[39:16] and ye say that in Jerusalem is the
[39:19] place where men ought to worship and so
[39:22] we we find out from this portion of
[39:25] scripture that there was two different
[39:28] uh ways of thinking
[39:31] between the Samaritans and the Jews the
[39:34] Samaritan's way of thinking was that
[39:36] here upon this mountain where our father
[39:39] Jacob dug this whale and and it has a
[39:42] lot of history in this place and it's a
[39:44] magnificent place where God did many
[39:46] wonderful things uh it's at this very
[39:49] place where we are taught where we have
[39:51] to worship God
[39:53] and outside of this mountain there's not
[39:55] a true worship of God
[39:57] and here you have the Jews point of view
[39:59] and they're saying hey Jerusalem is the
[40:02] place the Jerusalem is the place where
[40:05] we ought to worship God outside of
[40:06] Jerusalem guess what there's no true
[40:08] worship
[40:12] the Samaritans believed that on the
[40:15] mountain of uh girizim was the chosen
[40:19] place of worship by God
[40:22] the Samaritans believed that it was on
[40:25] this Mount where the blessings of God
[40:27] was to be
[40:29] um and we find that that is derived from
[40:31] Deuteronomy 11 and verse 29 and it shall
[40:35] come to pass when the Lord thy God hath
[40:37] brought thee in onto the land whether
[40:40] thou goest to possess it that thou shalt
[40:43] put the blessing upon Mount gurism
[40:45] jerism I don't know how you pronounce it
[40:48] and the curse upon Mount EBA
[40:52] and so we all are very familiar that the
[40:55] Samaritans are half-jews and they're
[40:58] half gentiles
[40:59] and so at one point though they were all
[41:03] Israelites they were all Jews they were
[41:06] all part of the same crowd that came out
[41:08] of Egypt that crossed the Red Sea that
[41:11] they were with God and and God did many
[41:13] mighty Works before their very eyes but
[41:15] when they crossed over into this
[41:17] promised land is where things now begin
[41:20] to change
[41:21] some seen it this way and another seen
[41:25] it that way and now little doctrines
[41:27] begin to form I see it this way and and
[41:30] I see it that way and well I'm gonna go
[41:33] with this guy because I see it like him
[41:35] well if we just say it at how the
[41:37] scripture says it there will be no
[41:39] divisions
[41:43] it was upon this mountain that the
[41:45] Samaritans built an altar
[41:47] it was kind of interesting as I was uh
[41:50] studying on this today that uh the
[41:54] Samaritans even built a temple upon this
[41:57] mountain
[41:58] now this mountain was 10 miles north of
[42:02] Jerusalem
[42:04] and it was the very first place where
[42:06] they went and uh there was many things
[42:08] happened on this on this mountain this
[42:10] gurism jurism mountain how do you say it
[42:13] somebody help me out here who did
[42:16] phonograms in school
[42:18] ISM okay
[42:20] I found out that I don't really know how
[42:22] to read correctly my kids they learned
[42:24] through phonograms I learned by memorize
[42:27] oh yeah
[42:28] it's not the right way to learn how to
[42:30] read
[42:33] and so we even find out that they had a
[42:36] a temple because they wanted to have a
[42:38] temple at the same time when the second
[42:41] temple when Jerusalem had their Temple
[42:43] and it's just very interesting because
[42:46] uh according to the histories there was
[42:49] a a Jewish priest that actually went up
[42:53] to this Temple and he destroyed it
[42:56] because true worship is only in
[42:59] Jerusalem
[43:01] and so he got us I don't know what
[43:04] happened
[43:05] he took off his religious coats he took
[43:07] off these different things and he turned
[43:09] into a vandal and he destroyed this
[43:12] Temple
[43:14] isn't it so funny how very quickly our
[43:18] our Christian views and our Christian
[43:20] beliefs and our Christian lives and uh
[43:23] our their righteousness that we pretend
[43:25] to put on so many times can very easily
[43:28] come off when people don't agree with us
[43:31] come on come on come on
[43:33] it's so true
[43:35] oh yeah I'm a Believer and I'm a
[43:38] Christian and then once in a while
[43:40] somebody gets on the wrong side of you
[43:41] and my goodness
[43:44] where did this guy come from
[43:47] yeah he's not sitting in church so he
[43:49] doesn't have his Halo on
[43:52] God help us
[43:55] yes
[44:00] so we find out that this mountain or
[44:03] this place of worship for the Samaritans
[44:05] it was uh it was a place of contention
[44:09] between the Jews and the Samaritans and
[44:12] so much that a Jew would never pass
[44:14] through a Samaritan City
[44:18] they despised each other so much
[44:22] that a Jewish man if he had to pass
[44:25] through the way of Samaria he would go a
[44:27] longer way to go around the city because
[44:30] they didn't want to be in the company
[44:32] with a Samaritan
[44:36] but the Bible says
[44:38] and he must needs go through Samaria
[44:44] no doubt when the when the disciples saw
[44:47] that Jesus was going through Samaria
[44:49] they wondered why is he going through
[44:53] this city why is he going in with the
[44:56] people of Samaria doesn't he know that
[44:58] they're a sinful people and there's
[45:00] contentions between us for hundreds or
[45:02] thousands of years doesn't he understand
[45:04] this why is he going that way
[45:08] because there was a seed of God there
[45:11] was somebody that needed to hear the
[45:12] word of God and God does the exact same
[45:15] thing with you and I sometimes he must
[45:18] needs come pass our way it doesn't
[45:21] matter where we are
[45:23] it doesn't matter where we were when we
[45:25] were Sinners but Jesus had a purpose one
[45:28] time to come past our way
[45:31] like brother James said he has an
[45:33] appointment with every one of us
[45:37] there was a need
[45:39] there was a purpose
[45:42] because there was a woman with a desire
[45:44] in her hearts
[45:45] in her heart
[45:48] hallelujah thank you Lord
[45:52] so the Jews we know that they obviously
[45:55] believe that in Jerusalem was the
[45:57] provided place of worship
[45:59] and that was the only provided place of
[46:02] worship
[46:03] in 1965 God's chosen place of worship
[46:06] brother Branham says there is only one
[46:08] place that God puts his name and that's
[46:10] not in a church
[46:12] but it's in Jesus there is only one
[46:15] place of worship only one place that you
[46:17] were received and that is in the Beloved
[46:20] Jesus Christ there is not another name
[46:23] given under Heaven given among men
[46:25] whereby be saved no church no Creed no
[46:29] nothing Jesus Christ that's why we must
[46:34] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:37] because there's no other name that is
[46:39] greater
[46:40] it is the greatest name that was ever
[46:42] spoke upon mortal lips
[46:45] I I found it very uh enlightening when
[46:49] brother meno was preaching on Sunday
[46:51] and he's giving his testimony I don't
[46:54] know about you but I could sit and I
[46:56] could listen to an elder give his
[46:58] testimony like that all day
[47:01] it's fascinating and here he was and
[47:04] he's and he's telling us yeah uh we're
[47:07] gonna go and we're going to get baptized
[47:08] in the name of Jesus Christ and and for
[47:10] us we're like yeah that's normal
[47:13] sure we've heard that for years that
[47:16] that's that's a simple Revelation for us
[47:18] yes 60 years down the line
[47:23] and so when you put yourself in their
[47:25] shoes why do we think brother Branham
[47:27] and almost all of his sermons
[47:30] he always hits on it you've got to be
[47:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if
[47:34] you've been baptized in another way you
[47:37] need to be re-baptized because at the
[47:40] time in which they were living in that's
[47:42] what was being preached Father Son and
[47:44] Holy Ghost and so now here was a prophet
[47:47] on the scene and the prophet and the
[47:49] word always corrects the error of the
[47:52] hour
[47:53] and so we stand time and time again
[47:55] every church he goes to and it's in the
[47:58] name of Jesus Christ it's not the titles
[48:00] of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[48:03] so now here you have a first generation
[48:05] message believer
[48:08] and the word now is being unfolded and
[48:13] unfolded as as they walk in the word and
[48:15] and brother manno you know what uh they
[48:19] go and they get baptized and everything
[48:20] and they go back to their little village
[48:22] well now they're all having a prayer
[48:24] meeting did you catch that why do you
[48:27] pray for somebody if they got an evil
[48:29] spirit or there's something wrong with
[48:31] them
[48:32] they thought what's wrong with you man
[48:34] he got baptized in the name of the Lord
[48:36] Jesus Christ it's not the correct way it
[48:39] would be like us
[48:40] going somewhere
[48:42] and coming back I think uh uh brother
[48:45] Tim had mentioned it on Sunday when we
[48:48] were fellowshipping brother Tim Hofer
[48:50] and he said it's like us going somewhere
[48:52] else and coming back to church and
[48:55] coming amongst the Brethren and saying
[48:56] oh praise the Lord I got baptized in the
[49:00] nidals in the titles of the Father Son
[49:02] and the Holy Ghost and I feel
[49:05] regenerated
[49:07] he'd be like let's hold a prayer meeting
[49:11] brother Stephen needs prayer he's off
[49:14] the word that's what they were thinking
[49:16] but when something it doesn't matter
[49:18] what the village was saying or what his
[49:20] dad was saying even though he was a
[49:22] young man when the word was being
[49:24] revealed it doesn't matter what anybody
[49:27] else says or does
[49:30] I found it fascinating
[49:32] yeah we got it too easy
[49:35] you know why because everybody agrees
[49:37] with us
[49:39] oh yeah it's true you ever tried to talk
[49:42] with somebody that doesn't agree with
[49:43] you
[49:46] it's hard
[49:48] and keep in the right spirit and having
[49:50] Fellowship
[49:53] takes a god it takes a christ-like
[49:55] character
[49:56] amen
[49:58] it sure does
[50:00] amen so we find out that God's provided
[50:04] a place of worship it is not a
[50:07] geographical location
[50:09] it is not in Jefferson Jeffersonville
[50:12] Indiana like some people want to make us
[50:14] think it's not in Arizona as some
[50:18] thought it was but universally it's in
[50:21] one place and that's in Christ Jesus
[50:28] it's not in a peculiar location Jesus
[50:31] did away with that he said it's not in
[50:34] this mountain nor is it in Jerusalem
[50:38] but it's in a person Hallelujah and
[50:42] that's the person that we need to get
[50:44] into is Christ Jesus and when we get in
[50:47] Christ Jesus now we can fellowship with
[50:50] him and worship by spirit and in truth
[50:55] notice this it's very interesting
[50:57] brother Bradham said questions and
[50:59] answers brother Branham I have some
[51:01] questions I wish to ask you I have heard
[51:03] people say that you have advised
[51:06] uh he says maybe I'd better leave that
[51:09] one alone too let's see well it's
[51:11] already time to quit maybe we'll uh he
[51:14] continues on he says I have heard people
[51:16] say that you have advised people to sell
[51:19] all their homes and follow you to
[51:21] Arizona or they would not be in the
[51:23] Rapture is this true
[51:25] that's a lie
[51:27] see uh-huh or should we sell our homes
[51:30] or did you even say this no sir isn't it
[51:35] amazing how something could be said and
[51:38] as it travels down this person well this
[51:41] person said that this person said and
[51:43] this person said that he said and before
[51:45] you know it it's so far out left field
[51:50] he said that's a lie remember remember
[51:53] Junie Jackson's dream that time when I
[51:56] went out there
[51:57] Journey dreamed that he saw how many
[51:59] remembers the dream and how the lord
[52:01] gave the interpretation the great
[52:04] Mountain he we was standing upon it and
[52:07] old washed out letters there and I was
[52:09] trying to interpret and I couldn't I was
[52:12] interpreting it to them after I got it
[52:15] it all interpreted all of it interpreted
[52:18] then I reached over and and got this in
[52:21] this dream now
[52:23] and some kind of a like a bar and just
[52:26] cut the top of the mountain off and
[52:28] looked in there and it was all Snow
[52:30] White like marble
[52:32] but it wasn't written on and I said you
[52:35] all stay here and look in on this now
[52:38] while I go younger
[52:43] what was he trying to tell them he was
[52:45] saying no you remember the dream that
[52:47] was given I have to go to Arizona I have
[52:50] a purpose for going to Arizona but you
[52:53] stay here and you look on this
[53:00] but everybody when you when you look
[53:02] this up there's like five six questions
[53:04] in a row brother Brown was just pulling
[53:06] them out did you say we have to move to
[53:07] Arizona did you say we have to move did
[53:09] you say no no no I didn't say that it's
[53:12] a lie
[53:13] but it was on the people's hearts why
[53:16] was it on the people's hearts because
[53:19] somebody was telling them that that's
[53:23] what he said
[53:27] now what am I getting to I'm getting to
[53:30] it's not a particular location
[53:34] remember the time when the person came
[53:36] to Jeffersonville and they and they were
[53:39] all excited and they said uh I'm coming
[53:41] to Jeffersonville because I want to make
[53:43] the Rapture well this guy he didn't know
[53:46] he was talking to brother Branham
[53:48] and it was something about uh uh where's
[53:51] the bridge in Jeffersonville because we
[53:53] go to the bridge in Jeffersonville the
[53:54] Raptor's going to take place and so on
[53:56] and so forth
[53:59] says the Raptor's not going to take
[54:00] place in Jeffersonville he said he took
[54:03] him into his house and he explained it
[54:05] to him and he he all know the story
[54:08] so it's not in Jeffersonville it's not
[54:11] in Arizona but it is in a place and
[54:14] that's Christ Jesus
[54:18] Hallelujah
[54:21] foreign
[54:22] now the scripture says
[54:26] I don't have where it is here I just
[54:28] have the verse it says it's talking on
[54:31] the Rapture and says I tell you in that
[54:33] night there shall be two men in one bed
[54:36] the one shall be taken and the other
[54:38] shall be left two women shall be
[54:41] grinding together the one shall be taken
[54:43] and the other left to man shall be in
[54:45] the field that one shall be taken the
[54:48] other left and they answered and said
[54:49] unto him where Lord
[54:52] you see the wondering of this location
[54:55] where is this location
[54:58] and he said unto them wheresoever the
[55:01] body is thither will the Eagles be
[55:04] gathered together
[55:06] so what does he stand there there'll be
[55:08] two sleeping
[55:10] because it's night time and it's time to
[55:12] sleep and there will be two that are
[55:14] grinding in the field what is the
[55:16] scripture trying to show us as trying to
[55:18] show us that the Rapture is a universal
[55:21] process it's not just for those of us
[55:25] within America it's not just for the
[55:28] ones and I forget but it's a universal
[55:30] thing this message is a universal
[55:33] message that has went around the world
[55:37] to gather the elected lady the Bride of
[55:40] Jesus Christ and it is calling her out
[55:43] of every Kindred Tongan nation and is
[55:46] calling her out of every denomination
[55:51] it is calling her out of every place
[55:53] every tongue it doesn't matter what
[55:55] color of skin they have it doesn't
[55:57] matter where they live on this planet
[55:59] Earth but the word of God is calling her
[56:02] and is calling her for a purpose and
[56:05] that purpose is to prepare her for a
[56:07] rapture
[56:08] so if the message is universal what is
[56:11] it showing us there will be two sleeping
[56:13] there will be two in the field and I'll
[56:15] take one
[56:17] it's not a location right
[56:20] because if it was a location
[56:22] say if it wasn't
[56:24] Czechoslovakia
[56:27] well that doesn't seem good for us in
[56:29] America
[56:32] we're in trouble
[56:36] I'm glad
[56:38] that it's not something of a natural man
[56:40] but it's something that is very
[56:42] spiritual and Supernatural
[56:47] even they were asking the Lord where is
[56:50] this place Lord there's only one place
[56:53] that we need to be in and that's in
[56:55] Christ Jesus for the Bible says for by
[56:58] one Spirit we are all baptized into one
[57:02] body and that's how you get into that
[57:04] body is by a baptism of fire that seals
[57:09] us to the day of our Redemption
[57:14] now Jesus said God is seeking for those
[57:19] who will worship Him in spirit and in
[57:22] truth
[57:24] Hallelujah
[57:27] John chapter 14 and verse 6 it says
[57:30] Jesus saith unto them I am the way the
[57:34] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[57:37] the father but by me because we can say
[57:41] well what is truth Lord
[57:43] there's over 900 denominations there's
[57:46] many different message churches where is
[57:49] the truth Lord he said I am the truth
[57:52] and what is Christ he is the the word
[57:56] that was made flesh and so what is it
[58:00] now that we're depending on as the
[58:01] revealed word of the hour to us
[58:04] personally
[58:10] that's why we can say with the prophet
[58:13] that we are feeding this evening on the
[58:16] unfailing body word of the son of man
[58:20] you notice it says brother Branham said
[58:22] the unfailing
[58:25] we always think of the body word of the
[58:27] son of man the embody word sure it's the
[58:30] body word of the son of man but it's the
[58:32] unfailing the unfailing body word this
[58:36] word of God has never failed us and has
[58:39] never failed and through seven Church
[58:42] ages it has never failed from Genesis to
[58:45] Revelations why because God is unfailing
[58:48] and he never did fail and he never will
[58:52] fail
[58:54] so put your trust in the unfailing body
[58:58] word of the son of man
[59:02] yes sir
[59:04] we will fail him
[59:06] and we will fail each other
[59:09] but he will never fail us
[59:15] this message
[59:17] this message is the revealed word for
[59:20] this day
[59:21] it is the unfailing body word of Jesus
[59:24] Christ
[59:24] and it has brought us back into
[59:27] fellowship and communion with God
[59:29] almighty
[59:30] you say what's the purpose of all this
[59:32] what's the what's the purpose of all
[59:34] this brother Branham and brother
[59:35] brannelman her brother Randleman ah
[59:38] there's a purpose behind it
[59:40] what is God trying to do he is trying to
[59:43] bring us back into Fellowship back into
[59:46] communion with him once again
[59:50] and I can say it's working
[59:54] it's worked in the history of my life
[59:57] it's working now and it's going to
[59:59] continue working why because I'm a work
[1:00:01] in process
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:07] so we realize that Jesus said take eat
[1:00:11] for this is my body
[1:00:14] what are we talking about we're talking
[1:00:16] about communion
[1:00:18] take eat for this is my body and and
[1:00:20] what did he do when he presented the the
[1:00:23] bread before the before his disciples he
[1:00:26] broke it
[1:00:27] take eat understand you cannot break
[1:00:30] this word yourself
[1:00:33] you cannot understand this word yourself
[1:00:36] the only way that we can understand the
[1:00:38] Bible that we can understand the message
[1:00:41] is when the Holy Spirit begins to uh
[1:00:44] break the bread before our very eyes I
[1:00:48] say Lord break the bread let us have
[1:00:51] communion Lord open my eyes of
[1:00:53] understanding father
[1:00:57] he's in here take this bread it's a type
[1:01:00] of my body that's going to be broken
[1:01:02] Take and Eat It
[1:01:04] he said here is this wine it's a
[1:01:07] representation of My Blood
[1:01:09] so now we're getting into worshiping in
[1:01:11] spirit and in truth
[1:01:13] because what is the bread of life it is
[1:01:16] the word of God and what is the wine
[1:01:18] that is a type of a a stimulation by
[1:01:22] revelation
[1:01:24] without feeding on the unfailing body
[1:01:27] word of Jesus Christ you will never be
[1:01:29] stimulated by Revelation by the Holy
[1:01:33] Spirit or the wine of God
[1:01:36] right if you're not feeding on it you'll
[1:01:39] never be stimulated by it but when
[1:01:42] you're feeding on it on a daily basis we
[1:01:45] take communion uh maybe two three times
[1:01:47] a year
[1:01:49] that's not that's that's okay within the
[1:01:51] church and the assembly but as an
[1:01:53] individual we ought to be having
[1:01:56] communion with God why because we have
[1:01:58] an open book we have the bread that's
[1:02:01] before us we have the wine that's before
[1:02:03] us so why not partake of it
[1:02:06] here it is partake of it I'm going to
[1:02:09] give it to you all you got to do is eat
[1:02:11] it all you got to do is get into it all
[1:02:13] you got to do is listen to the message
[1:02:17] it's part of having that communion with
[1:02:19] God
[1:02:21] Hallelujah but if you're not partaking
[1:02:23] of it
[1:02:26] when life gets so busy
[1:02:29] and we got a million things that's going
[1:02:31] on hey how many of you got extra time in
[1:02:34] your hands
[1:02:36] nobody
[1:02:38] but when something is very important to
[1:02:40] you
[1:02:41] when something is special to you when
[1:02:44] something really means something to you
[1:02:46] it doesn't matter how busy you are you
[1:02:49] will make time for it
[1:02:51] so you might say well I'm too busy and
[1:02:53] I'm caught up yeah who's not make time
[1:02:55] for it if this word is special to you if
[1:02:58] God has done something for you in your
[1:03:00] life we ought to make time for God
[1:03:05] you've got to be coming yes sir
[1:03:10] so what happens now when we begin to
[1:03:12] feed upon this word we become the word
[1:03:16] you say well I'm not seeing the change
[1:03:18] in my life that I ought to be seeing uh
[1:03:21] it's got to be the ministry
[1:03:24] who else better to blame than the
[1:03:26] ministry it's his fault he's not
[1:03:30] preaching it right and I'm not getting
[1:03:32] Revelation from his ministry it's not
[1:03:34] good enough it's not deep enough on and
[1:03:36] on yeah well what about your own
[1:03:37] personal life
[1:03:39] I'll be the first one to stand up and
[1:03:41] say I'm not the greatest preacher I know
[1:03:43] I'm not the deepest that's okay I am who
[1:03:45] I am but what are you doing in your own
[1:03:48] personal life
[1:03:50] it's time for us to really start
[1:03:52] feasting on this thing man
[1:03:58] you say well I've been feasting for
[1:03:59] years and I'm full nonsense
[1:04:03] you're just getting lazy
[1:04:07] get out and walk a little bit
[1:04:09] if you've been eating too much go for a
[1:04:11] little bit of a walk you'll want to eat
[1:04:13] a little bit more when you get back
[1:04:16] walk with God
[1:04:18] you feel that you're too full you're
[1:04:20] getting burned out get along with God
[1:04:22] and walk with them it'll make you want
[1:04:24] more
[1:04:28] amen
[1:04:32] communion with God is on a daily basis
[1:04:36] not just three times a year taking
[1:04:38] communion
[1:04:39] Hallelujah be encouraged what am I
[1:04:42] trying to do I'm trying to provoke you
[1:04:44] to Good Works
[1:04:46] I'm trying to provoke you and say hey
[1:04:49] chances are 99 of us aren't communing
[1:04:53] with God like we should be notice I put
[1:04:55] myself in there too
[1:04:58] sure sometimes you get to preaching like
[1:05:00] oh my goodness Lord is really stomping
[1:05:03] all over my toes and that's okay because
[1:05:06] I'll take it home and I'll take it to
[1:05:07] heart
[1:05:15] so
[1:05:18] Jesus said
[1:05:19] take
[1:05:21] and eat this bread
[1:05:25] take this thing
[1:05:28] and partake of it
[1:05:30] how do I partake of a book you read it
[1:05:33] spiritually speaking
[1:05:35] I'm going to eat a little bit every day
[1:05:38] you know they you know they say uh
[1:05:42] uh you shouldn't eat like three big
[1:05:44] meals a day
[1:05:45] eat a big breakfast big lunch big dinner
[1:05:47] well then you can't sleep at night
[1:05:49] because you eat a big dinner and anybody
[1:05:50] ever done it
[1:05:52] sure you have weird dreams feed
[1:05:54] something spicy
[1:05:57] my parents used to tell me can I have a
[1:06:00] string cheese mom
[1:06:01] no son I'll give you nightmares well she
[1:06:04] just didn't want me eating it right
[1:06:06] my mom and dad told me so many lies that
[1:06:09] I believed
[1:06:16] oh bless their hearts huh
[1:06:22] you don't need to sit down and partake
[1:06:24] of the whole book of Isaiah in one
[1:06:26] sitting
[1:06:27] you'll wear yourself out
[1:06:30] your eyes will begin to cross and you'll
[1:06:32] forget what you read why because you're
[1:06:34] too full and you can't contain any more
[1:06:36] but if you eat a little bit at each at
[1:06:39] each meal if we eat five or six little
[1:06:42] meals instead of eating three big meals
[1:06:44] guess what
[1:06:46] will be a spiritual machine
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:52] John 4 verse 24 says God is a spirit and
[1:06:56] they that worship Him must worship Him
[1:06:58] in spirit
[1:06:59] and in truth
[1:07:01] I begin to thinking on worshiping God
[1:07:04] and spirit and because we've already
[1:07:08] touched on uh worshiping God in in truth
[1:07:12] and as message Believers I I believe we
[1:07:15] have that down pretty good
[1:07:17] yeah it's easy for us to to worship God
[1:07:20] in truth because we believe we're
[1:07:22] walking in truth we're walking we're
[1:07:24] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:07:26] light and this truth and this word is
[1:07:28] unfolding to us but now when we begin to
[1:07:30] walk in the spirit it's uh how do we how
[1:07:35] do we how do we worship God in spirit
[1:07:38] what happens when we worship God in
[1:07:41] spirit
[1:07:42] and so I began to think about it and I
[1:07:46] immediately thought
[1:07:48] uh I immediately thought about
[1:07:50] worshiping God in Spirit uh like um like
[1:07:54] John like John the Revelator
[1:07:57] you remember in the Book of Revelation
[1:07:58] chapter 1 verse 10 and it says and I was
[1:08:02] in the spirit in the Lord's day now when
[1:08:06] I begin to think about that I thought it
[1:08:08] was
[1:08:09] um very interesting because John didn't
[1:08:12] wait until the Lord's day to get into
[1:08:15] the spirit now we realize the day of the
[1:08:18] Lord It's The End time and that's when
[1:08:20] God was revealing these things to him
[1:08:22] but let me just break this down in
[1:08:24] Simplicity for us that John didn't wait
[1:08:28] to go to church to get in the spirit
[1:08:31] but he was already in the spirit on the
[1:08:35] Lord's day when he went to church
[1:08:38] and because he was already in the spirit
[1:08:41] when he went to church and he gathered
[1:08:44] together by the Believers I'm talking
[1:08:46] about you and I now God began to reveal
[1:08:50] things to him that he had never seen
[1:08:52] before
[1:08:54] and too much of the time we as uh
[1:08:57] Believers and in our carnality and
[1:08:59] different things we want to come to
[1:09:01] church we and we want to we want the
[1:09:03] song leader to get us into the spirit we
[1:09:06] want the preacher to get it get us into
[1:09:07] the spirit we want the people beside us
[1:09:10] to get us into the spirit
[1:09:12] God just let me get in the spirit before
[1:09:15] I leave because I really want to hear
[1:09:17] something from you
[1:09:18] Because unless we're in the spirit of
[1:09:21] God God can't speak to our hearts
[1:09:25] well just about the time you get relaxed
[1:09:27] and you get into the service you begin
[1:09:30] to get into the spirit guess what the
[1:09:31] service is over
[1:09:34] but now if we as believers
[1:09:37] would get into the spirit of God before
[1:09:40] we got to the assembly
[1:09:42] I believe that God would speak to our
[1:09:45] hearts way more than he ever has in
[1:09:48] Times Gone by
[1:09:52] he was already in the spirit well how do
[1:09:54] you get in the spirit
[1:09:56] you could sing a song everybody's
[1:09:58] different
[1:09:59] you could say a prayer
[1:10:02] you could take your family before you
[1:10:04] get into the car instead of rush rush
[1:10:07] rush let's go hey let's take 30 seconds
[1:10:10] let's calm our Spirits at home
[1:10:13] let's settle ourselves a little bit so
[1:10:16] that when we're on our way to church
[1:10:18] guess what our spirit we're already
[1:10:20] working on getting into the spirit let's
[1:10:23] get to church 30 minutes early if we can
[1:10:27] let's sit and let's meditate let's get
[1:10:30] in the spirit that when the word Goes
[1:10:32] Forth it'll have an effect in our lives
[1:10:38] Hallelujah
[1:10:40] so John was in the spirit he came to
[1:10:43] church already in the spirit God help us
[1:10:46] I wanna I wanna uh
[1:10:49] I'll just say provoke you once again
[1:10:51] throw something out there Sunday morning
[1:10:55] take this to Heart come to church in the
[1:10:58] spirit
[1:10:59] come to church with your spirit already
[1:11:00] settled
[1:11:02] the things of home and the cares of life
[1:11:05] and everything leave it at home
[1:11:07] because when we leave the building it's
[1:11:10] still going to be there
[1:11:11] but while we're here let's meditate on
[1:11:14] the things of God that our hearts and
[1:11:16] our Spirits are ready to receive from
[1:11:19] God
[1:11:19] so Sunday morning
[1:11:21] I want you to get up 30 minutes earlier
[1:11:24] I want you to get ready 30 minutes
[1:11:26] earlier well we're usually at church by
[1:11:30] um we're usually here about 9 18. Sunday
[1:11:34] schools are Sunday singing starts at 9
[1:11:36] 20. we're two minutes early we're making
[1:11:39] it praise the Lord
[1:11:41] I want to be here at nine
[1:11:44] sure
[1:11:46] so I'm gonna get up 30 minutes earlier
[1:11:48] you're going to get up 30 minutes
[1:11:50] earlier you're going to get ready 30
[1:11:52] minutes you're going to be ready earlier
[1:11:54] than you've ever been ready why because
[1:11:56] you have this desire in your heart that
[1:11:58] you want to be in the spirit by the time
[1:12:01] the word is being preached who wants to
[1:12:03] do it with me
[1:12:05] hold yourselves accountable you're all
[1:12:08] going to be waiting here for me aren't
[1:12:09] you nine o'clock
[1:12:12] I do this all the time I shouldn't do
[1:12:14] this stuff to myself
[1:12:18] I like to do stuff with other people
[1:12:22] so let's do it together
[1:12:25] you say I can't do it don't give me your
[1:12:27] excuse I got five kids
[1:12:30] eight years old and younger
[1:12:33] absolutely I know all about it
[1:12:40] but if you do it and you get here early
[1:12:42] guess what the holy spirit will move and
[1:12:44] there won't be such a uh a barrier there
[1:12:49] won't be such a barrier because you know
[1:12:50] what our carnal man does our carnal man
[1:12:52] causes a barrier between us and God
[1:12:56] it's this guy and it's a barrier did you
[1:12:59] know that you are not a human being on a
[1:13:02] spiritual journey
[1:13:04] you are a spiritual being
[1:13:07] trapped in a human body
[1:13:09] on an Earthly Journey
[1:13:13] but this thing gets in our way it makes
[1:13:16] excuses and it's a barrier between us
[1:13:19] and God but if we can get rid of this
[1:13:21] barrier once in a while and if we can
[1:13:24] bring it under the subjection to the
[1:13:26] Holy Spirit God will really move
[1:13:32] amen amen
[1:13:33] okay nine o'clock
[1:13:36] now
[1:13:38] so I began to think on
[1:13:41] revivals and I began to think on what
[1:13:44] does it mean to have a Revival what does
[1:13:47] it mean to be in Revival what happens
[1:13:50] when a person or a church is in Revival
[1:13:54] I think it's very sensible questions
[1:13:57] that we can ask ourselves about
[1:13:59] worshiping God and spirit and in truth
[1:14:01] because when I think of worshiping God
[1:14:03] and spirit I think of revivals I think
[1:14:06] of uh the 1950s and the 1960s when there
[1:14:11] was the speaking in tongues and and the
[1:14:14] different gifts and the manifestations
[1:14:16] of this spirit and I begin to think of
[1:14:18] dancing in the spirit and and all these
[1:14:21] different uh outward emotions that we
[1:14:24] can go through when it seems like a
[1:14:26] person is in Revival
[1:14:29] and so I thought well
[1:14:31] sure
[1:14:33] that can be part of a person being in
[1:14:35] Revival that could be part of a church
[1:14:38] that perhaps is being in a Revival and
[1:14:42] and so you can't help when you think
[1:14:45] about revivals uh
[1:14:48] thinking about the Welsh Revival
[1:14:52] and brother Branham says there was these
[1:14:55] uh two clergy men I'll just read the I
[1:14:57] have the the thing here I'll just read
[1:15:00] it trying to do God a service without it
[1:15:02] being his will he says it was said that
[1:15:04] some noble man from the church nobleman
[1:15:08] went over to Wales to understand or
[1:15:10] figure out what all the mechanics was in
[1:15:12] the Revival
[1:15:13] during their Welsh Revival and when they
[1:15:15] got off the ship with all their tall
[1:15:17] hats and their their round collar you
[1:15:20] know he's talking about round collar
[1:15:22] this white thing here everybody knows
[1:15:25] and I'm a preacher
[1:15:26] I think I should get a white collar and
[1:15:28] wear it so everybody knows everybody
[1:15:30] should know by our lives and our
[1:15:32] testimony
[1:15:35] another round caller scene coming down
[1:15:38] the street a little policeman swinging
[1:15:40] his little Club around like that and
[1:15:42] whistling they said my good man could
[1:15:44] you tell me where the Welsh Revival is
[1:15:47] then he said yes my brethren you're
[1:15:50] standing in the middle of it uh-huh he
[1:15:52] said you understand I am the Welsh
[1:15:56] Revival because the Welsh Revival is in
[1:15:59] me
[1:16:01] so every word that that little policeman
[1:16:04] went whether he was directing traffic on
[1:16:07] the street that's where their Welsh
[1:16:09] Revival was when he got into his police
[1:16:11] car that's where the Welsh Revival was
[1:16:14] when he went home to his family that's
[1:16:16] where the whale survival was it wasn't
[1:16:19] in a certain location
[1:16:21] but everywhere he went that location had
[1:16:24] a Revival because he was bringing the
[1:16:27] Revival with him because he was in
[1:16:29] Revival
[1:16:32] these clergy men went to Wales looking
[1:16:35] for a Revival because they weren't in
[1:16:38] Revival themselves
[1:16:40] they were looking for a a physical
[1:16:43] location to go to and to visit and say
[1:16:45] if I can just go there I'll be in the
[1:16:48] Revival they might be with people who
[1:16:51] are in Revival but if they don't have
[1:16:53] the Revival in their own hearts
[1:16:56] if they're not revived themselves
[1:17:00] Hallelujah
[1:17:02] it's not a location
[1:17:04] well we could go from this revival to
[1:17:07] that Revival and from this place and
[1:17:09] think well well this one's got it and
[1:17:11] that one's got it no it doesn't matter
[1:17:13] if you go there if you don't got it
[1:17:16] you see what I'm saying
[1:17:20] but you've got to be in Revival yourself
[1:17:23] and when you're in Revival it doesn't
[1:17:26] matter if no one else within the
[1:17:29] assembly is in Revival or not it doesn't
[1:17:31] matter what anybody thinks because you
[1:17:34] know you've been you've been drinking on
[1:17:36] that that that that uh whale of water
[1:17:39] that is Flowing up within you and you're
[1:17:41] not thirsting for the things of the
[1:17:43] world anymore
[1:17:44] Lord I'm thirsting for you
[1:17:47] that's why I'm in Revival because I've
[1:17:49] been drinking from you that's why I'm in
[1:17:52] a Revival because I've been eating all
[1:17:54] the unfailing body word of Jesus Christ
[1:18:01] so it doesn't matter about anybody else
[1:18:06] you might be the one that Sparks it in
[1:18:09] somebody else's life
[1:18:15] sure
[1:18:17] you know what a little spark does and a
[1:18:19] bunch of dry grass
[1:18:22] starts a fire
[1:18:25] you know what a little spark will do in
[1:18:27] your life around somebody that seems
[1:18:29] that's going through a little dry spot
[1:18:30] in their life he'll cause a fire
[1:18:34] that is unquenching the bull that cannot
[1:18:37] be put out
[1:18:41] amen
[1:18:42] everywhere he go everywhere that little
[1:18:45] man went guess what he was in Revival
[1:18:48] what about you and I
[1:18:50] it's a Revival within us that everywhere
[1:18:54] we go hey guess what
[1:18:56] the Phoenix Revival
[1:18:58] it ain't over
[1:19:00] why because I'm right here amongst you
[1:19:06] so I began to keep thinking on this on
[1:19:09] revivals and so I looked up with brother
[1:19:11] Branham said about it the identification
[1:19:14] of Christ in all ages and he said now a
[1:19:18] Revival isn't exactly adding new members
[1:19:21] to the church
[1:19:23] he said a Revival is Reviving that what
[1:19:27] you've already got
[1:19:29] so we understand that as human beings we
[1:19:34] can get cold
[1:19:35] we can get starchy we can get
[1:19:39] indifferent but when a Revival comes
[1:19:42] guess what it revives that which God had
[1:19:46] already given to us
[1:19:52] he said a Revival is driving what you
[1:19:55] got and he says and sometimes I've
[1:19:57] wondered what a Revival is for
[1:20:00] here's the prophet of God I've wandered
[1:20:04] 1964. I've wondered what a Revival is
[1:20:06] for this may sound a little strange for
[1:20:10] a stranger to you to say this but I was
[1:20:13] standing by the Lakeshore one day in
[1:20:14] Lake Michigan I was watching the waves
[1:20:17] how they come in and went out and they
[1:20:19] would leap oh it was it was Heavy Winds
[1:20:22] of blowing and the waves would Dash way
[1:20:24] in the air and churn up and down and
[1:20:26] roll in and come back and roll in again
[1:20:29] and I thought my what a Revival so here
[1:20:34] he is he's he's looking at the things
[1:20:36] that catches your attention right off
[1:20:38] the bat wow what a Revival the waves are
[1:20:42] crashing the waters are churning my
[1:20:45] goodness this is amazing how wonderful
[1:20:49] I've never seen something as good as
[1:20:50] this
[1:20:52] keep reading
[1:20:56] it can begin to roll in and roll I said
[1:20:59] my what a Revival but you know there is
[1:21:02] no more in water in that Lake than it is
[1:21:05] when it's perfectly normal and quiet
[1:21:08] that's right
[1:21:12] you know there's no less Holy Spirit in
[1:21:15] your life when you're sitting humble and
[1:21:18] quiet in an assembly then when the holy
[1:21:21] spirit moves and you get all excited
[1:21:24] that's what he's saying here
[1:21:26] he's saying there's no more water in it
[1:21:28] it's just acting differently but it
[1:21:31] doesn't make it any different or any
[1:21:33] better
[1:21:35] watch
[1:21:37] what uh that's right it's got the same
[1:21:40] amount of water see then I wonder why is
[1:21:43] that Lake all stirred up just the same
[1:21:46] as we get stirred up in a Revival we
[1:21:49] turn around you know
[1:21:51] um
[1:21:52] you know what it always does to the lake
[1:21:55] though
[1:21:56] it cleans it
[1:22:01] it washes all the trash out on the bank
[1:22:04] so that's why we have to have a Revival
[1:22:07] for
[1:22:08] not for the churning of the waves and
[1:22:11] the crashing and the great wonderful
[1:22:13] things that we're seeing out in the
[1:22:15] ocean but we're having a Revival to get
[1:22:18] the trash out
[1:22:19] he said that's what a Revival is for is
[1:22:23] to take the trash that was within that
[1:22:26] body of sea and to push it to the shore
[1:22:29] amen good
[1:22:33] he said that's why we have to have a
[1:22:37] Revival
[1:22:38] oh brother Stephen you're saying a
[1:22:40] Revival what are you talking about are
[1:22:42] you talking about the churning and the
[1:22:43] twisting and and the praising the God
[1:22:45] and the hallelujahs that might happen
[1:22:47] but uh what I'm really talking about is
[1:22:51] getting the trash out of our lives
[1:22:55] Revival
[1:22:56] that's what a Revival is for
[1:23:00] get all the unbelief and things away
[1:23:03] from us so we can see more clear of what
[1:23:05] God wants for us that's what we're
[1:23:08] anticipating this time as a Revival
[1:23:12] among the people what kind of a Revival
[1:23:16] among the people a Revival of getting
[1:23:18] the trash out of our lives
[1:23:22] so understand that we are a body of
[1:23:25] water
[1:23:26] let me type us as the ocean or as Lake
[1:23:29] Michigan
[1:23:30] and there's trash and all these
[1:23:32] different things that's within that I
[1:23:34] got to thinking about this that was
[1:23:36] within the the Lake Michigan the lake
[1:23:39] never put that trash in its life
[1:23:43] it was because of other things
[1:23:46] outside resources other people whatever
[1:23:49] it might have been I don't know but
[1:23:52] somehow or another this pollution and
[1:23:55] this trash got into the ocean it got
[1:23:58] into the lake and now God was causing a
[1:24:01] Revival within the ocean or within the
[1:24:03] lake what for what purpose to get this
[1:24:07] trash out of its body of water
[1:24:12] I say that this is the kind of Revival
[1:24:16] that we need
[1:24:18] not just as an assembly but as an
[1:24:21] individual people
[1:24:24] we need to have a good old-fashioned sin
[1:24:28] repenting Revival that this that the
[1:24:31] trash that is built up deep within this
[1:24:34] ocean of body that the holy spirit will
[1:24:36] move and it gets kicked out to the shore
[1:24:42] that's what we need in our lives
[1:24:45] and that'll produce the joy of the Lord
[1:24:49] that'll produce a song in your heart
[1:24:52] that'll produce a spring in your step
[1:24:55] why there's nothing like a good old
[1:24:57] repenting and getting things off of your
[1:24:59] heart to God
[1:25:03] ain't talking about saying sorry
[1:25:07] I'm sorry
[1:25:09] you know we have a cusp we have been
[1:25:12] raised uh to say I'm sorry
[1:25:16] oh I'm sorry I hurt your feelings I'm
[1:25:18] sorry
[1:25:20] I'm sorry
[1:25:22] oh you are yep
[1:25:24] sorry
[1:25:25] see you're sorry to your brother sorry
[1:25:28] you're sorry yep you won't do it again
[1:25:30] promise
[1:25:34] do it again
[1:25:37] and they do it again and we do it again
[1:25:40] we sin again
[1:25:43] we sin against the Lord again I'm sorry
[1:25:44] Lord yep sorry
[1:25:46] sorry I didn't mean to I'm sorry
[1:25:50] Jesus didn't say say you're sorry and
[1:25:53] and and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:25:55] Christ
[1:25:58] he said repent
[1:26:02] then be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:26:04] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:26:05] not your sorry when you're sorry about
[1:26:08] something you're going to do it again
[1:26:11] but when we repent of something in our
[1:26:14] lives we're walking this way I didn't
[1:26:17] mean to do that Lord I repent and we
[1:26:20] turn from that evil thing and we walk
[1:26:24] the other direction so when I say we
[1:26:27] need a good old-fashioned sin repenting
[1:26:30] life-changing experience in our lives
[1:26:33] that's what I'm saying we need to turn
[1:26:35] from our evil ways
[1:26:36] stop the nonsense from saying I'm sorry
[1:26:39] I'm sorry I didn't mean to stop saying
[1:26:42] you're sorry
[1:26:46] and repent
[1:26:48] how do I repent stop doing it
[1:26:55] I wonder who it is amongst us as just
[1:26:57] continually living in sin
[1:27:02] and they come to church they feel
[1:27:03] convicted and they say I'm sorry Lord
[1:27:06] I'm sorry
[1:27:08] I wonder who it is amongst us it's
[1:27:10] that's that's taken the odd drink
[1:27:13] smoking the odd cigarette
[1:27:16] living on true to their partners
[1:27:19] living untrue to their husband untrue to
[1:27:22] their wives
[1:27:24] wonder who it is that's living a double
[1:27:25] life amongst us
[1:27:28] and every time you come to church you
[1:27:29] just say I'm sorry you say my brother
[1:27:32] how can you say this stuff
[1:27:35] I don't know
[1:27:36] I'm just saying it
[1:27:39] and you come to church and you feel bad
[1:27:41] because there's there's a presence here
[1:27:43] that's not in your home because your
[1:27:46] home is filled with sin
[1:27:49] and then you come to a place that is
[1:27:51] Sanctified a place that is set apart for
[1:27:53] the work of the Lord and you feel his
[1:27:55] presence you say oh my goodness I'm a
[1:27:58] man of unclean lips I am a man with an
[1:28:01] unclean heart and an unclean mind Lord
[1:28:03] I'm sorry
[1:28:05] but when you leave the presence we go
[1:28:07] right back to the same sin
[1:28:10] stop saying you're sorry to God
[1:28:13] is not mocked
[1:28:15] and he will not be mocked
[1:28:18] Hallelujah
[1:28:20] it's time to repent
[1:28:23] it's time to make things right
[1:28:26] it's time to make a 180 degree turn
[1:28:29] and say Lord I am sorry
[1:28:33] but I repent
[1:28:35] I Repent from that life I Repent from
[1:28:37] watching that stuff I Repent I Repent I
[1:28:40] won't do it again and give me strength
[1:28:43] Lord because I'm a weak vessel that when
[1:28:46] I'm tempted to do those things again you
[1:28:48] give me the strength to overcome
[1:28:52] be honest with God and God will help us
[1:29:02] sorry don't cut it
[1:29:08] it's not good enough
[1:29:10] why because typically we don't mean it
[1:29:15] if you say you're sorry and continue the
[1:29:17] same way that you're doing treating each
[1:29:19] other treating those around us
[1:29:22] treating your kids treating your parents
[1:29:24] treating your husband your wife yeah I'm
[1:29:25] sorry I shouldn't have I overreacted I
[1:29:27] should have yeah you're not you're just
[1:29:29] sorry it happened but you're not sorry
[1:29:31] because if you were sorry you wouldn't
[1:29:33] do it again
[1:29:34] try using the word repent
[1:29:37] I repent I Repent I repent for how I
[1:29:41] spoke to you
[1:29:42] I repent for how I acted I Repent of
[1:29:45] that thing it'll change our mindset a
[1:29:47] little bit
[1:29:48] because we don't really believe
[1:29:51] we don't believe in ourselves when we
[1:29:53] say I'm sorry
[1:29:56] I repent
[1:29:58] I repent and I am sorry
[1:30:01] Hallelujah
[1:30:03] yes sir
[1:30:07] as the musicians come
[1:30:14] when we repent of our sins
[1:30:17] God is faithful
[1:30:19] and God is just
[1:30:21] to forgive us of our sins
[1:30:24] he is not a God that holds things over
[1:30:26] us
[1:30:27] he is not a God that when we approach
[1:30:29] him the correct way with the right
[1:30:31] attitude and with a repenting heart he's
[1:30:33] not here to always remind us of the
[1:30:35] things that we were doing That's what
[1:30:37] Satan does
[1:30:39] but the Bible says that he is just and
[1:30:42] that he is willing to forgive us of our
[1:30:45] sins and of our wrongdoings as long as
[1:30:48] we approach him in the right way
[1:30:52] and when we have
[1:30:54] truly repented of those things
[1:30:57] you remember you remember when you first
[1:31:00] repented and came to Christ
[1:31:02] you remember the burden that lifted off
[1:31:04] of you
[1:31:06] it was amazing
[1:31:08] there was like this burden that we were
[1:31:11] carrying we didn't know what it was and
[1:31:14] when we came to God and it was a true
[1:31:15] repentance of of God
[1:31:18] my God
[1:31:21] I'm a sinful and I'm a Wretched Man but
[1:31:24] you if you would have Grace upon me
[1:31:27] father if you would just show me some
[1:31:29] mercy
[1:31:30] I Repent of what I'm doing you remember
[1:31:34] how it felt
[1:31:36] you remember the burden that lifted off
[1:31:38] of you
[1:31:40] that's what we need to get back to
[1:31:45] oh Father forgive me of my sins I'm
[1:31:47] sorry
[1:31:52] now when you repent you know what it's
[1:31:54] going to do it's gonna put you in a
[1:31:56] Revival
[1:31:59] foreign
[1:32:01] how can a sinful person that's living on
[1:32:04] true to the word of God be in a Revival
[1:32:07] at the same time
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:11] can bitter and sweet water come out of
[1:32:14] the same fountain
[1:32:18] but when we truly change from our ways
[1:32:20] and the things that we're doing and
[1:32:21] those little secret things that we
[1:32:24] believe that no one sees and perhaps God
[1:32:26] doesn't even see it when we turn from
[1:32:28] those things
[1:32:30] it'll put you on a spiritual Revival
[1:32:34] the reason being because you're no
[1:32:37] longer going to be running from God
[1:32:41] when a man has sin in his life he won't
[1:32:43] pray he won't read his Bible
[1:32:46] and he'll be neglecting to go to church
[1:32:48] why because he's feeling convicted in
[1:32:51] his heart
[1:32:55] but when we repent of those things
[1:32:57] ye know your life
[1:33:00] and you know the inner things that's
[1:33:03] within your heart
[1:33:04] you know the things that you're
[1:33:06] struggling with you know the things
[1:33:08] that's going on in your family let the
[1:33:10] Holy Spirit discern those things
[1:33:16] my goodness Lord
[1:33:19] your word is a sharp and a two-edged
[1:33:23] sword you know what it's doing right now
[1:33:25] it's cutting
[1:33:27] it's cutting to the ascenders it's
[1:33:28] cutting down deep and it's separating
[1:33:31] the flesh from the spiritual man
[1:33:34] and when the word of God separates us
[1:33:36] from our spiritual man it puts our
[1:33:38] spiritual man in a Revival
[1:33:41] it gets us back into the word it gets us
[1:33:44] back into our prayer life it gets us
[1:33:46] back into being happy to go to church it
[1:33:49] gets us back into uh wanting to pay your
[1:33:52] tithes and support the cause it gets you
[1:33:54] back into the things of God why because
[1:33:57] the flesh man is being cut away
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:01] now what will that produce I don't know
[1:34:06] we're all different
[1:34:09] but I know one thing that what it'll
[1:34:11] produce it'll produce a closer walk with
[1:34:13] God
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:17] it'll produce something that pushes the
[1:34:20] trash out of our Lives into the seashore
[1:34:23] [Music]
[1:34:24] I wonder
[1:34:26] I wonder if you were to imagine in your
[1:34:29] mind of an ocean
[1:34:32] and picture all this trash
[1:34:35] that's upon the ocean
[1:34:37] and you think my goodness that ocean is
[1:34:39] being destroyed by all this trash
[1:34:43] that beach is being destroyed by all
[1:34:46] this trash look at it it's disgusting
[1:34:49] the waters are nice the beach is nice
[1:34:51] but look at the trash
[1:34:54] it's nasty it's disgusting
[1:34:57] I wonder if you were to visualize the
[1:35:00] beach in your life
[1:35:04] what would you what would you see on the
[1:35:06] shores
[1:35:07] of your life if it was to be
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:11] cast out if it was to be removed by the
[1:35:14] presence of God
[1:35:18] those things that you're thinking in
[1:35:20] your mind right now
[1:35:22] those things that you're visualizing
[1:35:24] those are the things you need to repent
[1:35:26] of
[1:35:29] [Music]
[1:35:32] Hallelujah
[1:35:43] foreign
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:50] to something within my spirit keeps
[1:35:52] crying out
[1:35:55] pretty bad
[1:36:00] I don't need to scream it
[1:36:07] I don't need to holler
[1:36:11] all we need is the Holy Spirit to
[1:36:13] Quicken it
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:18] I don't know who it is
[1:36:20] or what you got going on
[1:36:22] [Music]
[1:36:24] but I'm feeling very sensitive right now
[1:36:28] to say repent
[1:36:31] stop this sorryness
[1:36:35] God doesn't listen to your sorry
[1:36:39] but he wants you to repent of those
[1:36:41] things
[1:36:43] stand and pray together
[1:36:46] foreign
[1:36:49] father
[1:36:53] I thank you for your word
[1:36:57] I thank you Lord that your word is a
[1:36:59] two-edged sword
[1:37:01] father that it cuts and it
[1:37:04] tears apart the Flesh of man
[1:37:07] Lord that our spiritual man
[1:37:10] would be free to worship you in spirit
[1:37:13] and in truth
[1:37:16] and father this is our desire
[1:37:19] that we can worship you that way Lord
[1:37:24] father I stand in the gap for your
[1:37:28] children tonight
[1:37:30] father forgive him of their sins and
[1:37:33] shortcomings
[1:37:34] I pray Lord that this little simple
[1:37:37] sermon cut up as it was Lord
[1:37:41] would bring forth much fruit in the
[1:37:43] lives of your children
[1:37:47] I ask it for your Kingdom's glory in
[1:37:49] Jesus name
[1:37:51] amen
[1:37:55] you know it's not only in a church
[1:37:58] service where God moves
[1:38:00] but it's in your car
[1:38:02] it's when you're at home
[1:38:04] it's when you're by yourself
[1:38:07] so much of the time is
[1:38:10] as Ministry
[1:38:13] I feel we think that the only place is
[1:38:16] to to repent is at the altar here in
[1:38:18] front of everybody else
[1:38:22] but it's not true
[1:38:24] because his God is omnipresent
[1:38:28] and he'll meet you wherever you are
[1:38:32] at whatever time it is whatever place it
[1:38:35] is
[1:38:36] it doesn't have to be a certain
[1:38:39] geographical location
[1:38:42] but as long as the heart is sensitive
[1:38:45] and it means what it is saying that's
[1:38:48] where God will meet the believer
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:00] you can help the trash in our lives
[1:39:04] brother Stephen what happens next
[1:39:08] just let go and let God
[1:39:11] let God have his wonderful way
[1:39:15] don't try to manufacture something
[1:39:19] don't try to act some way just because
[1:39:21] somebody else acted a certain way when
[1:39:24] they got delivered but be yourself
[1:39:28] be an individual
[1:39:30] and when it happens it happens
[1:39:33] and then you'll be able to give God
[1:39:35] glory and then after it happens you
[1:39:38] don't stop there but you fuel the fire
[1:39:41] you don't take the log that was within
[1:39:44] the water and try to put it on the fire
[1:39:47] of the Holy Spirit it'll it'll quench it
[1:39:49] but you feed the holy spirit with things
[1:39:53] that burn correctly
[1:39:56] we feed it with the word we feed it
[1:39:59] through prayer we feed it through
[1:40:01] singing we feed it through worship and
[1:40:04] then next thing you know as an
[1:40:06] individual you're on fire for God and in
[1:40:10] the midst of the greatest Revival that
[1:40:12] you've ever been in
[1:40:14] and it doesn't matter if anybody else is
[1:40:17] touched or not but you're touched you're
[1:40:20] touched when you come to the service
[1:40:22] you're touched when you leave the
[1:40:24] service why because the Holy Spirit
[1:40:26] Revival is within your heart
[1:40:29] and wherever you go the Revival is with
[1:40:32] you
[1:40:34] don't just keep it for the church
[1:40:36] services amen
[1:40:41] but let go let's just sing that song one
[1:40:44] more time let go
[1:40:46] and let God have his wonderful way
[1:40:50] his ways are wonderful
[1:40:54] his ways are unfailing
[1:40:57] his ways are so much above our ways but
[1:41:02] when we give ourselves to the ways of
[1:41:05] God
[1:41:07] it'll turn our lives upside down
[1:41:12] the Bible says that the disciples went
[1:41:14] out and they turned the world upside
[1:41:16] down
[1:41:19] in other words it changed the lives of
[1:41:22] people that they came in contact with
[1:41:25] and we tell you when you get into the
[1:41:28] spirit of of of repenting of our sins
[1:41:31] and turning from those things when we
[1:41:33] get into a spirit of Revival of kicking
[1:41:36] the trash out of our Lives when we get
[1:41:38] into a spirit of worshiping God freely
[1:41:42] after those things let me tell you just
[1:41:45] let go
[1:41:46] let God have his way and it'll turn our
[1:41:50] lives
[1:41:51] upside down
[1:41:54] hey man let's sing this together
