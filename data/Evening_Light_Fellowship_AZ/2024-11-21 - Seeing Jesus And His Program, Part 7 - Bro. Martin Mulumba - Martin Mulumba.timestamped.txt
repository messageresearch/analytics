[29:53] tonight we ask all these things in Jesus
[29:56] Christ's name amen
[29:58] amen may God bless you all
[30:01] tonight uh it is a privilege once again
[30:04] to be in the house of the
[30:06] Lord uh shall we take our Bibles in the
[30:09] book of 2 King chapter
[30:16] 4 uh we keep uh
[30:19] pursuing
[30:22] our title of uh seeing Jesus and his
[30:25] program this will be part seven by God's
[30:27] grace
[30:31] um 2 King chapter
[30:35] 4:8 probably be a lengthy reading but uh
[30:39] we'll go till verse 17 but I'll probably
[30:42] just read two three verses so you may
[30:44] have your seat right after and it fell
[30:48] on a day that Elisha passed to shenon
[30:52] where was a great woman and she was
[30:55] contrain and she constrained him to eat
[30:58] bread and so it was that has of as he
[31:03] passed by he turn he turned in heer to
[31:06] eat bread and she said unto her husband
[31:10] behold now I perceive that this is an
[31:13] old and holy man of God which passes by
[31:16] us continually let us make a little
[31:19] chamber I pray thee on the wall on the
[31:22] wall and let us set him uh set for him
[31:25] there a bed and a table and a stool and
[31:28] a candle stick and it shall be when he
[31:32] cometh to us that it shall turn in
[31:35] theater may God bless the reading of his
[31:38] the word you may be
[31:40] seated
[31:41] uh thank you once again brother R for
[31:45] the opportunity and uh thank you Church
[31:48] to make it uh
[31:51] tonight believe uh by God's grace uh
[31:54] this will be sing Jesus and his program
[31:57] El let us Ministry part
[31:59] four uh We Believe by God's grace we'll
[32:03] try to maybe close it up according to
[32:07] his leadership because I think uh this
[32:10] also will be my uh last sermon as a
[32:19] bachelor and uh but God grace so we'll
[32:23] uh we'll proceed from uh maybe next time
[32:26] that we meet again we'll be I'll be
[32:29] waving my hand a little bit
[32:31] more to bless the rest of the people
[32:36] amen um we see that um the Bible says
[32:40] that he fell on the day that Elisha pass
[32:43] to Shon where there was a great woman uh
[32:47] we can see that Elijah's Ministry is
[32:50] very uh specific we understand that uh
[32:54] this is times calls him Elijah Elijah
[32:59] we're not speaking on the natural man
[33:01] Elisha but we're speaking about the
[33:03] ministry that changes forms and does
[33:06] specific things and takes shapes and
[33:09] form as we have seen it in previous
[33:11] messages that the spirit of the Lord
[33:13] comes in form of the brothers and
[33:15] sisters uh but we want to look into uh
[33:19] this part where uh the man of God was
[33:21] dealing with uh uh the great woman of
[33:25] shanam who was a barren woman but we
[33:28] understand that according to the
[33:30] prophecy that no woman was to be uh
[33:33] Barren in the land but then we see uh
[33:37] that the woman was uh looking at uh the
[33:42] man of God who was passing by he she
[33:45] just didn't accept him or carry him over
[33:48] because we understand that in the hour
[33:51] that we living in deception is quite at
[33:53] a higher rate that even the very learned
[33:56] one and intellectual ones uh they are
[33:59] quite easily deceived in the last days
[34:02] and after they they've taken the
[34:04] decision to become transgender and
[34:06] things after a while then they realize
[34:09] that they've done a FAL mistake that
[34:11] they can't reverse it then we see that
[34:14] it was uh the woman of shum shun uh
[34:18] looked at uh the man of God uh he said
[34:22] like you know let me approach him let me
[34:24] go to that church let me listen to that
[34:27] sermon a little bit by God's grace and
[34:30] looking into the situation uh she turned
[34:33] to her husband uh she was under a
[34:36] certain leadership she was not a free
[34:38] woman as uh we see the feminist U system
[34:43] in this last hour but she was always
[34:46] able to report to her husband before she
[34:48] takes any decision she said like you
[34:50] know my husband with um feeling this
[34:53] leadership and say well I perceive that
[34:57] uh that this is an holy man of God as
[35:00] we've looked into the prophet we looked
[35:03] at him we just didn't accept him or even
[35:06] the Lord Jesus himself it said that you
[35:08] know you don't need to uh believe me but
[35:11] the works that I do testify of who I am
[35:14] and the works that Jesus did brought us
[35:18] to the great understanding of who he was
[35:20] from Genesis all the way to Malachi in
[35:23] the days that he was in the days of his
[35:25] flesh and um the man of God was walking
[35:30] by continually by God's grace and uh we
[35:33] uh he brought him a little bit close she
[35:36] brought him a little bit closer uh she
[35:38] started looking at him what are you
[35:40] preaching what are your Doctrine and
[35:42] stuff and when she came to the
[35:43] realization that hey there's a there's
[35:46] something different about this man then
[35:49] she said let us make a little chamber
[35:51] somewhere I pray thee on the wall and
[35:54] let us set for him there a bed in a
[35:58] household where the household was not
[36:00] just a place of movies and all kind of
[36:03] music and all things but they had a
[36:05] table set up for prayer for prayer
[36:07] meeting and to be able to listen to The
[36:10] Prophet but then watch then she goes
[36:12] into a little bit more details and start
[36:15] setting up the altar in the house and
[36:17] she said like you know let us have a
[36:19] table and let us have a stool and a
[36:21] candle stick and we understand that uh
[36:24] the candle stick is the mystery of the
[36:26] seven Church ages that uh they un she
[36:29] understood that this man was able to
[36:32] give us what we have need of because she
[36:36] just didn't approach the man of God with
[36:39] the understanding of bless me let me
[36:42] have a call let me have this let me have
[36:44] that no she first desired to know what
[36:48] the man had with him because uh in this
[36:52] hour uh we go by uh the outward
[36:55] appearance she's beautiful handsome he's
[36:58] very muscular he has all these things
[37:00] and he works this job and let me do a
[37:03] background check let me see his credit
[37:06] score and all these things but then the
[37:08] woman didn't go about that the woman
[37:10] understood God's program in the timeing
[37:13] which she was living in and then she
[37:16] said that and it fell on the day that he
[37:18] came here and he turned into the chamber
[37:22] he accepted the invitation because Jesus
[37:24] always keeps all his appointments and
[37:26] lay there
[37:28] and let and he said to Gaz his servant
[37:31] because when the word of God comes into
[37:34] your life that he also start looking at
[37:36] what's going on when you are interested
[37:38] in him he's also interested in you come
[37:41] draw nowhere to me and I'll draw nowhere
[37:44] near to you then uh the woman start
[37:47] looking and
[37:48] said yeah the prophet start looking at
[37:51] her said what's her
[37:53] problem what can we do for her she's
[37:57] doing all this great work what can we do
[37:59] for her and she said and he said unto
[38:01] him he said say now unto her behold thou
[38:05] has been carefully care careful for us
[38:09] with all this scare what is it what is
[38:13] to be done for thee wouldest thou be
[38:16] spoken to to the king or the captain of
[38:19] the host and she answered I dwell among
[38:23] among uh my own
[38:26] people and he said what then is to be
[38:29] done for her and gazi answered verily
[38:33] she had no
[38:35] child and her husband and her husband
[38:38] he's old this takes us back directly in
[38:41] Genesis 18 because the same scenario a
[38:44] barren woman in the land in the time of
[38:47] visitation because she understood that
[38:50] this is the hour of our visitation that
[38:53] this man of God in the land is not just
[38:55] a natural man just like the the rest of
[38:57] the people but this is a sent angel of
[39:01] God and this angel of God didn't just
[39:04] come along just uh to uh pass by and eat
[39:08] the bread and collect Titan offering but
[39:11] the man of God came with the table came
[39:14] with the Candlestick came with the bed
[39:17] because all these things place the altar
[39:21] right in the house and in this hour that
[39:24] the Church of the Living God is called
[39:26] also to be that Tabernacle that where
[39:30] all the altar the candlesticks and
[39:32] everything the uh Ark of the Covenant
[39:35] has to be laid in and she understanding
[39:38] it said like you know I need to bring
[39:41] this man by because he's not looking
[39:43] unto a man but she is Discerning the
[39:45] body of Christ understanding the
[39:48] ministry of the son of man in the hour
[39:50] of her visitation and according to the
[39:53] purpose of her life she knows that God's
[39:56] program in the Bible is Bound for her to
[40:00] give
[40:01] birth she didn't just bring a problem
[40:04] first to the to the men of God he say
[40:06] come first rebuild the altar in the
[40:10] house after rebuilding the altar then
[40:13] now we have access with boldness to the
[40:17] king of kings and when we get to him
[40:20] then is bound by his word to fulfill his
[40:23] word he said then what is your issue she
[40:26] said you know I am I live among my
[40:29] people I go to church we see that you
[40:33] pay the tights and offering and
[40:35] everything that's fine but then what is
[40:38] your issue then the prophet look say oh
[40:41] she doesn't have a child there's no
[40:45] pedigree there's no continuity of the
[40:47] life the man is
[40:50] old he doesn't have any pleasure
[40:54] anymore but then he said he said he said
[40:57] call her come here then she comes to the
[41:00] prayer line and when he called her she
[41:03] stood in the door and he said about this
[41:07] season according to the time of life
[41:10] thou shall Embrace a
[41:13] son Genesis 18 and when the visitation
[41:17] came back then it was a body made out of
[41:22] the Dust of the Earth but in this hour
[41:26] it was a man born of a woman and a
[41:30] man that has to cover to Veil this God
[41:35] because this God that was
[41:37] unseen unheard of this God that was
[41:42] walking in the middle of the Candlestick
[41:44] of in the uh in the midst of the candles
[41:47] sticks this one that was seen by
[41:50] John walking in the midst of it all and
[41:53] at the end he said I shall see my
[41:56] pedigree
[41:57] amen because the promise because God's
[42:00] word does not go forth it does not it
[42:03] doesn't go forth without fulfilling the
[42:05] purpose where unto it was sent and when
[42:08] the word went forth then it was said
[42:10] that you know according to the time of
[42:13] life and for her to be able to get to
[42:16] the time of life the man must be made
[42:19] young
[42:20] again there must be a body change made
[42:24] prepared in order for the seed to come
[42:27] forth in the body again and when the
[42:30] seed goes into the body then now the
[42:33] word must be brought to
[42:35] manifestation and as she was standing in
[42:37] that time of visitation very conscious
[42:41] of what God has Proclaim for her
[42:45] life and accordingly as we see we saw it
[42:48] in the previous services that we set
[42:51] under the ministry of
[42:53] Elijah we're not sitting there under
[42:56] denomination
[42:57] cares we're not bringing our own ideas
[43:01] but we are conscious that we have found
[43:04] those that the prophet has has spoken
[43:08] about Jesus came and died upon the cross
[43:11] but that was not
[43:13] enough because Jesus Paid the price
[43:17] after paying the price then he required
[43:19] reclaiming the price and by reclaiming
[43:23] we needed now the visitation the
[43:25] manifestation that nature was looking
[43:29] for because when he got married to the
[43:33] woman he had the promise that he shall
[43:37] see his
[43:38] pedigree but he found himself that he
[43:41] was getting old and older and nothing
[43:44] was happening but glory be to God
[43:47] there's nothing new Under the Sun that
[43:49] when we understand the cycle that we
[43:51] know that when the Sun rises it will
[43:53] bring forth life again but then it
[43:56] require first that the seed to be in the
[43:59] seed in the in the soil and now it said
[44:03] that and and and and and uh verse 16 and
[44:07] and he said about this season according
[44:09] to the time of life thou shall Embrace a
[44:11] son and she said name my Lord thou men
[44:15] of God do not lie to me she gets excited
[44:20] he said I've waited this all my life
[44:24] nobody I've went to all the churches
[44:27] I've seen all kind of
[44:29] denominations please do not lie to me
[44:32] all the previous one could not give me
[44:35] life nobody all of them they were just
[44:37] taking advantage of me John 4 when she
[44:41] was standing there at the at the well he
[44:43] said like you know you've had five
[44:45] husbands and the one that you have right
[44:47] now is not yours none of them could be
[44:50] able to take away her shame and we've
[44:53] walked all these seven Church ages and
[44:56] we've went on probbing on these things
[44:58] probbing on that that we we couldn't
[45:01] understand the deity of Jesus Christ we
[45:03] couldn't understand the mystery of the
[45:05] revealed
[45:06] book but then at the evening time and it
[45:09] fell on a
[45:12] day and on the day of visitation that he
[45:15] say like you know this is my
[45:17] word and this is the promise and This
[45:21] Promise according to the time of life
[45:24] it's no more just go and believe it
[45:26] shall happen no no no no no no it's a
[45:29] precise moment according to the time of
[45:32] life and when you understand that when
[45:35] is the time of life in your life then
[45:39] you know how to walk with Precision with
[45:43] boldness and you know I'm going to claim
[45:46] my inheritance because at at the year 50
[45:50] 49 we start
[45:52] looking when is the sun
[45:54] rising as soon as we start seeing that a
[45:58] little bit of light it doesn't matter if
[46:01] we see the entire Revelation but as long
[46:04] as we see a little bit of light We Shall
[46:06] Believe the whole truth because what he
[46:09] has started it shall surely bring it to
[46:11] pass because he is the author and
[46:17] finisher and when we believe him he said
[46:21] yes do not lie to me thou men of God
[46:25] unto the handmade
[46:27] and the woman conceive the Bible says
[46:30] and bear a
[46:31] son and that season that Elisha had said
[46:35] unto her according to the term of life
[46:39] and this is the time in which we are
[46:41] living in that the world the
[46:45] church we are finding that despite of
[46:49] all this
[46:50] Revelation despite of all this
[46:53] requirements that is set by God's word
[46:56] that the Church find himself a little
[46:58] bit struggling to be able to move
[47:01] forward the church finding itself trying
[47:04] to look like the rest of the world it's
[47:08] as if like no there's no more excitement
[47:11] in the church it's almost as if like you
[47:13] know going to church and being sitting
[47:16] in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[47:18] is such a burden in this last
[47:21] hour because there's a deception out
[47:25] there that looks so much better
[47:27] than what God has
[47:29] promised brother bam says the spiritual
[47:31] Amnesia paragraph 49 they had a bed case
[47:35] of it after God had been good to them
[47:38] and brought them up from all the Heathen
[47:41] lands and made them a separate people
[47:44] separated them to himself he said he
[47:48] took a vine out of another country and
[47:50] planted it over in another country how
[47:53] he fixed it around and make it grow
[47:56] fruitful uh uh to grow fruit and be
[47:59] fruitful but the vine forgot where its
[48:02] blessings come
[48:05] from the church in this hour they forget
[48:10] who they
[48:12] are we forget we try like you know to
[48:14] compare ourselves out there and at times
[48:18] it's just after service a day or two and
[48:21] then we are back again into those
[48:24] things then there's an issue
[48:28] then there's something wrong happening
[48:30] but then in seeing Jesus in his program
[48:33] that this woman must be able to keep
[48:36] this thing conscious before her must be
[48:39] able to walk according to this because
[48:41] this is her
[48:42] motivation because this is what will
[48:45] keep her working in certain line in
[48:49] order to reach the maturity that is
[48:52] Promised in the word and the word here
[48:55] is showing the type of this woman as a
[48:58] tree and this tree has to be planted by
[49:01] the rivers of water and this rivers of
[49:04] water is not some man-made ideas but the
[49:07] message of the
[49:09] hour because she when she received the
[49:13] word of Elisha she has to start working
[49:16] every day with the understanding that
[49:20] according to the time of life I have to
[49:24] conceive her mind is f focus upon what
[49:27] the prophet
[49:30] said the pmos vision in John 15 Jesus
[49:33] said I am the vine ye are the branches
[49:37] he is the men Vine that which come out
[49:39] of the original root from the original
[49:42] seed that that has the life in it now
[49:46] the vine does not bear
[49:48] fruit it is the branches that do
[49:51] that now watch this you can take the you
[49:55] can take a Citrix tree such as an orange
[49:58] tree and and graft it into into it a a a
[50:04] a grapeful grape fruit limb a a lemon
[50:07] limb a tangelo limb and all kind of
[50:10] variety of things but those grafted
[50:13] limbs will not bear
[50:16] oranges why no sir the lemon limb will
[50:20] bear
[50:21] lemon and the grap grapefruit limber
[50:24] will be grapefruit and so on yet those
[50:27] limbs will be driving of the life in the
[50:31] tree but if that tree ever puts forth
[50:34] another branch of
[50:38] itself if
[50:40] ever the son of man comes down and find
[50:44] faith on
[50:47] Earth then he shall bring forth a seed
[50:51] after
[50:52] itself but then the woman under the
[50:56] leaders ship of Elijah elishah under the
[50:59] leadership of Elijah Elijah under the Le
[51:02] of God's leadership all together we are
[51:05] bound to reproduce the same
[51:08] life and this woman are is bound to do
[51:13] exactly God has promised in the word for
[51:15] her to fulfill pastors deacons hashers
[51:20] house wife everything that you can tell
[51:24] that we seeing the mystery of the Bible
[51:26] in the
[51:27] woman because that's what we've been
[51:29] showing seeing Jesus in his program that
[51:32] we started with Martin Luther King Jr a
[51:35] minister who couldn't keep God's program
[51:38] but was was in uh enticed by the
[51:41] communist
[51:43] Spirit but here now that we see that
[51:46] according to God's program God called
[51:48] Elijah he said anoint these three
[51:51] people these three people have specific
[51:54] things that will that will be happening
[51:56] in the land and we seeing the world
[52:00] getting excited in the world of
[52:03] message about Donald Trump
[52:06] reelection and all these things
[52:09] here but then there's no excitement
[52:11] about the brides
[52:14] Ministry we are more excited about what
[52:16] they what be happening how the tax code
[52:19] will be you know helping the
[52:22] businesses but then if it doesn't
[52:25] fulfill what said that is going to
[52:29] fulfill then you know the other Camp
[52:31] will return in full power and that will
[52:34] just rush us into God's
[52:36] program and if the
[52:39] expectation according to God's program
[52:42] is for him to do what he said to do to
[52:45] bring make America great again then
[52:47] God's program will
[52:50] fail that can only be understood so
[52:52] according to the prophet
[52:56] because in Noah's time they were given
[52:59] seven days to get into the ark but they
[53:02] never met it in they thought that Noah
[53:06] was
[53:07] crazy they thought that seventh day they
[53:10] always say like you know there's no more
[53:12] rain oh the war in Ukraine will stop and
[53:15] we'll have a good life and
[53:18] everything don't be
[53:20] deceived see Jesus and his
[53:23] program tell him to show you what is
[53:25] happening
[53:27] Donald Trump will not do
[53:29] anything the prophet told us there's no
[53:32] Abraham Lincoln there's nobody good that
[53:35] will put there that will bring back the
[53:37] country the country is far gone since uh
[53:42] 56 and when you reject the word you give
[53:46] the that you open the door for the devil
[53:48] to be
[53:50] incarnate and this is the nation that
[53:53] deceive all the world
[53:56] with all the filter of
[54:01] Jezebel Let It Be Joe Biden Let It Be
[54:05] Obama Let It Be Bush Let It Be whoever
[54:08] we we want to have Elon Musk or whatever
[54:10] you want to have back there the country
[54:13] is
[54:14] gone if God gives us seven
[54:18] years as he did in t Noah's time let's
[54:22] be assure to be inside and to be inside
[54:26] is to see Jesus and his program and to
[54:29] know exactly my position because the
[54:33] program is showing us that Elijah has
[54:35] come and anointed the people and who are
[54:38] you anointed by now you start bitting
[54:41] there looking at Donald Trump as your
[54:43] savior come on
[54:46] church you can see this without God's
[54:50] program because when we that's why we
[54:53] say like you know sit under Elijah's
[54:55] Ministry amen it's not just a sermon but
[54:59] this is a calling and alert that do not
[55:01] be deceived God is still walking is
[55:04] still
[55:07] moving because in the day of his flesh
[55:11] the Roman Empire was was leading the
[55:13] world as America is leading the world
[55:15] today they saw the manifestation on um
[55:19] Matthew 17 his
[55:22] adoption he came down we have received
[55:24] The Cloud of Glory today amen and then
[55:28] when he goes and they crucified him by
[55:30] the Roman
[55:32] system did that give them ways to become
[55:35] greater again
[55:38] no he said that you know
[55:40] pray that when the destruction come let
[55:43] it not be in
[55:46] Winter pray that when that that time
[55:49] comes you're not on the justification
[55:52] level sanctification
[55:54] level but be thou adopted you know am be
[55:59] thou placed in the body be thou like the
[56:02] woman said that I know that this is a
[56:05] man of God let bring in him let bring
[56:09] him bring him inside let's set the table
[56:13] and the the the the the the the tapes
[56:15] and
[56:16] everything let's be a work
[56:19] church and the prophet is showing us now
[56:22] this church here like they bringing all
[56:25] these ideas grap uh uh grafting it to
[56:28] the tree he said no no no no no but he
[56:30] say when I have that type of seed again
[56:34] if the vine because the root that's
[56:37] where the seed was it gave out the root
[56:40] and he gave the vine and if that vine is
[56:44] able to produce its own uh uh branches
[56:47] it will bring forth the same
[56:50] seed and that seed is what we are
[56:53] looking for because the seed shall come
[56:55] back to
[56:59] seed it's not like you know we we coming
[57:02] to church and the church is standing
[57:03] there and you know politics this and
[57:06] this is going to get better no it's not
[57:09] we want to go home
[57:11] anyways we want to go
[57:14] home and when we want to go home we
[57:17] looking at the
[57:18] calendar when you know the time this
[57:20] season the the you the cycle you know
[57:24] it's in 17 days it's in 15 days it's in
[57:29] 4
[57:30] days because when the uh the bo the the
[57:34] the son from Chicago came to Denver he
[57:37] said like you know look at the time and
[57:39] the season when you start seeing this
[57:42] come and stand at the door and you shall
[57:44] see me coming while the rest of the
[57:47] sisters were looking at her like you
[57:49] know do you think that that really is
[57:50] going to happen do you think that
[57:53] William brandham really knows what he's
[57:54] talking about do you really if think
[57:56] like you know this is going to happen
[57:58] then before you know it yes and he is
[58:03] that's the voice of my beloved he's
[58:05] coming on The Chariot I can hear him
[58:09] coming and this coming we're not talking
[58:12] about him coming we talking about the
[58:18] departure and he is coming to take us
[58:22] away what is our Focus the sisters the
[58:25] denomination the politics
[58:28] no because the woman said do not lie to
[58:33] me I am very I'm taking you
[58:36] seriously I've watched you I've listened
[58:38] to your
[58:40] tapes do not lie to me I am your
[58:43] servant I've given the water to the
[58:47] camels and this message you must take me
[58:50] to the to my husband and if this message
[58:53] doesn't take us to our our master then
[58:56] what are we we are the most deceived
[58:59] people in the
[59:01] world and we have to be very certain of
[59:07] God he said that's the way the church is
[59:10] the vine has been split into Limbs and
[59:13] have been grafted in they have grafted
[59:16] Baptist limbs Methodist Limbs and
[59:18] Presbyterian Limbs and Pentecostal Limbs
[59:21] and those limbs are are bearing Baptist
[59:23] Methodist Pentecostal and Pres Arian
[59:27] fruits we call ourselves and message
[59:30] Believers
[59:32] fruits of our own understanding our
[59:35] Doctrine left and right but then if we
[59:38] go back to the fruit to the very seed
[59:42] word the spoken word we have to produce
[59:45] the same
[59:47] thing may God help me to go quickly and
[59:51] get to the message here denominational
[59:54] seeds from from which they produce the
[59:56] fruit but if the vine ever brings forth
[59:59] another branch of itself the branch will
[1:00:01] be exactly the the vine itself it will
[1:00:04] be the same kind of a of a branch that
[1:00:06] was brought forth at Pentecost it will
[1:00:09] speak in tongues prophesize and have the
[1:00:12] power and sign of the of the resurrected
[1:00:15] Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ why because it's striving on the
[1:00:20] natural resources of the vine itself
[1:00:27] like you know brother brother said this
[1:00:29] year I think this one here he was too
[1:00:31] radical he was making a joke he wasn't
[1:00:35] he didn't really understand what did
[1:00:38] watch the PN in the message
[1:00:40] first sir sit down with the prophet let
[1:00:44] me insist on
[1:00:46] that sit down with the prophet watch the
[1:00:49] P from 47 that is recorded all the way
[1:00:52] to 65 it's the same pattern
[1:00:56] amen he may express it for prayer
[1:00:59] meanings and prayer line and discernment
[1:01:04] and all that you want to call it first
[1:01:06] pool second third pool but then when
[1:01:09] start God start opening his
[1:01:11] word he's not a partial
[1:01:15] God because he's the one from Genesis to
[1:01:20] Revelation he may have given us a little
[1:01:23] bit of information in the 40s in the 50s
[1:01:27] in the 60s until we were mature enough
[1:01:30] to Bear what he was said in
[1:01:36] 60s
[1:01:38] otherwise we we'll be we'll be looking
[1:01:40] at the message like you know this is not
[1:01:42] important and before you know it you end
[1:01:45] up with a car you say like you know oh
[1:01:47] in the car the most important thing is
[1:01:49] just the wheel a comfortable seat and
[1:01:51] all this year I don't need the the the
[1:01:54] the spark plug and I don't need the the
[1:01:57] the the injector and stuff before you
[1:01:59] know it the car can
[1:02:01] move you can't get
[1:02:03] anywhere because you've believed in some
[1:02:05] of the things of the message and some
[1:02:07] other you've left them out but say you
[1:02:10] know what good is it to have such a
[1:02:12] beautiful building such a beautiful
[1:02:14] people but there's no power of the Holy
[1:02:16] Ghost in
[1:02:17] them what good is it like you know to
[1:02:20] look like Church Believers but then
[1:02:22] there's no message in US
[1:02:27] that's what he's expressing here that if
[1:02:29] we are the same the the the vine is
[1:02:32] producing the same uh H Branch again he
[1:02:36] will bring forth the very same
[1:02:39] seed because he doesn't compromise on
[1:02:41] his word he's looking at us and he wants
[1:02:44] us to have exactly the very life of his
[1:02:49] own there's no
[1:02:51] debate for those who have been to the
[1:02:53] army they can tell you that there's no
[1:02:55] debate
[1:02:56] everything has been figured out for you
[1:02:59] everything you have to say like know yes
[1:03:00] sir yes sir you just stand up and yes
[1:03:03] sir go catch your hair yes sir wake up
[1:03:07] at 5 yes sir that's what it is there's
[1:03:11] no debate there's not democracy in there
[1:03:13] and democracy has proven its
[1:03:16] limit they've went into democracy and
[1:03:19] they've done all kind of things the
[1:03:20] prophet shows us he said like you know
[1:03:22] the only thing that will work is God
[1:03:24] blessing a king upon a nation that he
[1:03:26] choses to place himself and the city the
[1:03:30] only head that will sit there is the
[1:03:33] king of the the son of
[1:03:34] David precise
[1:03:38] word we need to bring forth the word we
[1:03:42] need to bring forth the
[1:03:44] seed why you see it wasn't grafted into
[1:03:47] the vine it was born in the
[1:03:53] vine when those other es were grafted in
[1:03:57] all they could do was Bear their own
[1:03:59] fruit for they they were not born of
[1:04:02] that
[1:04:03] vine that they don't know about the that
[1:04:06] original life and original Fruit they
[1:04:11] cannot know that they were not born of
[1:04:13] it but if they had been born of it that
[1:04:17] same life that was in the original stem
[1:04:20] Jesus would come would would have come
[1:04:24] through them and manifest ed through
[1:04:28] them and the Lord is looking into that
[1:04:31] and when he's looking into that he's
[1:04:34] very
[1:04:35] conscious that this is done according to
[1:04:38] his
[1:04:39] promise Isaiah
[1:04:41] 53:10 it say yet it pleased the Lord to
[1:04:44] bruise him the seed The Original Seed he
[1:04:48] have put him to grief when th shall make
[1:04:52] his soul an offering for sin
[1:04:56] and yet he shall see his seed he shall
[1:05:01] prolong his days how does he prolong the
[1:05:04] day Jesus changing
[1:05:06] forms Jesus along the church
[1:05:10] edges because the woman was
[1:05:13] Barren there was a promise that you
[1:05:16] shall not there shall not be barren
[1:05:18] woman in the
[1:05:19] land and here he says that he has to see
[1:05:23] seed but the seed to come forth it
[1:05:26] require a
[1:05:28] land and that land is the woman and this
[1:05:32] woman now has to bring forth according
[1:05:34] to the word of
[1:05:35] elishah and Elijah is standing there he
[1:05:38] say like you know I do not call you
[1:05:40] church anymore but I call you
[1:05:43] what and the bride is just to stand
[1:05:46] there with beautiful pictures and day of
[1:05:48] the wedding thing no go
[1:05:52] home bring forth according to what the
[1:05:56] time of
[1:05:58] life she has that understanding and if
[1:06:02] this doesn't take place she has all the
[1:06:05] right to question
[1:06:08] that as Rebecca did with
[1:06:13] Isaac said like you know why why am I
[1:06:16] not uh I believe was Jacob if I'm not
[1:06:20] mistaken and Jacob will say am I God am
[1:06:23] I the one giving children
[1:06:26] that's why we go in the
[1:06:28] churches we go to fitness we want to be
[1:06:32] young but that's not the husband that
[1:06:35] will make us
[1:06:37] young we go to the doctors they do
[1:06:40] everything they
[1:06:43] can they're taking babies and destroying
[1:06:46] the lives and taking all the resources
[1:06:48] to make them
[1:06:49] young in China they stand out making F
[1:06:52] pray they transplant why there that deep
[1:06:57] calling to live
[1:06:59] forever there's that deepness that he
[1:07:02] shall see he se but they didn't come
[1:07:05] according to God's
[1:07:07] program that's the problem with the
[1:07:11] church they want to come with their own
[1:07:14] resources they say like the Bible said
[1:07:16] in that day the woman will come and say
[1:07:19] you know we'll just carry your
[1:07:22] name we'll pay our own thing we'll will
[1:07:25] dress the way we want we will do
[1:07:27] whatever we want but he say no you have
[1:07:31] to see me and my program I'll tell you
[1:07:35] the way
[1:07:36] back I'll lead you step by step you
[1:07:40] don't know you've never been this way
[1:07:42] stay behind the
[1:07:43] ark but the church doesn't want that
[1:07:47] because they were grafted
[1:07:50] in since they were grafted in that's why
[1:07:53] it's so hard for them to believe the pr
[1:07:56] Propet that's why they're finding all
[1:07:58] mistakes in the
[1:07:59] message but then if they set like Elijah
[1:08:03] set under Elijah's Ministry it will be a
[1:08:06] whole different
[1:08:07] thing the prophet is showing it to us in
[1:08:11] different shapes and form and all the
[1:08:13] examples that's why I said it's the same
[1:08:17] pattern different examples three woman
[1:08:21] Minister child of God bride of Christ
[1:08:25] Apostle all that is the same program
[1:08:29] that God is revealing himself the
[1:08:31] prophet says did did it do good by
[1:08:34] hiding all these things no but he has
[1:08:36] revealed it in what in all the types and
[1:08:39] shadows of the
[1:08:41] Bible and if you can see Jesus so in
[1:08:45] this program what are you going to
[1:08:48] do then you just grafted
[1:08:50] in then we just like you know walking
[1:08:53] around you know this Pastor said that
[1:08:55] Pastor Pastor said but the pastor is he
[1:08:57] grafted in or is he born
[1:09:01] in he shall see seed he shall prolong
[1:09:05] his days and the pleasure of the Lord
[1:09:07] shall prosper in his hand and this woman
[1:09:11] and this man that has the that has the
[1:09:14] seed in him the Bible says in
[1:09:18] Psalm
[1:09:20] 128 but God's grace uh to read it a
[1:09:23] little bit it was uh such a blessing the
[1:09:26] the whole sermon was changed a few hours
[1:09:28] ago it was supposed to go into a
[1:09:31] different if into a different Channel
[1:09:34] but by God's grace and I was uh so
[1:09:37] surprised myself saying the last minute
[1:09:40] this is good that means like you know
[1:09:42] people need some other things than what
[1:09:45] uh was uh previously given because uh he
[1:09:48] walks with you every day you know he
[1:09:51] looks at you and he knows exactly what
[1:09:54] uh what is happening in in your life and
[1:09:57] by God's grace this are these are the
[1:09:59] great greatest elements that we can ever
[1:10:03] desire uh Psalm
[1:10:06] 28 blessed blessed is is everyone that
[1:10:11] fearth the Lord that WTH in his way for
[1:10:14] Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands
[1:10:18] happy shall thou be and it shall shall
[1:10:21] be well with thee thy wife the woman thy
[1:10:26] wife shall be as a fruitful
[1:10:30] Vine by the side of thine house thy
[1:10:34] children like Olive plants around thy
[1:10:36] table he is seeing the wife a fruitful
[1:10:39] Vine the woman was Barren but she was
[1:10:42] standing in the day of visitation
[1:10:44] because the promise was given to him to
[1:10:47] see a
[1:10:48] seed he said you know behold thus shall
[1:10:53] be the man
[1:10:55] be blessed that fearth the
[1:10:57] Lord the Lord shall bless thee out of
[1:11:01] Zion and thou shall see the good of
[1:11:03] Jerusalem all the days of thy life yes
[1:11:07] thou shall thou shall see thy children's
[1:11:10] children and a peace upon Israel and
[1:11:13] that is the promise and he's looking to
[1:11:16] for this full promise to be fulfilled
[1:11:18] and as he saying that God's program is
[1:11:21] lined up with this woman the promises to
[1:11:24] be fruitful and he says who is that
[1:11:30] woman who is that woman what does she
[1:11:35] do probably the next 20 minutes that
[1:11:38] will be my sermon here who can find The
[1:11:41] Virtuous Woman proverb
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:44] 31 who is that woman who can find
[1:11:49] it William brandham what are you doing
[1:11:52] go out there and find me that bride
[1:11:55] go out there and find me that virtuous
[1:11:59] woman he said Brothers I have to
[1:12:04] go and when this word was given to him
[1:12:08] this responsibility Abraham said come
[1:12:12] and swear upon my tie that you shall not
[1:12:16] go to the
[1:12:18] denominations you shall not go to the
[1:12:20] daughters of of Canaan and all these
[1:12:22] things because we know who they are
[1:12:26] we know they are grafted in but where is
[1:12:29] this virtuous
[1:12:31] woman then he start giving the
[1:12:35] description he
[1:12:37] said elezar when you go out there I want
[1:12:42] you to understand that type of a
[1:12:44] woman I need to give you the
[1:12:47] description the mystery of that woman
[1:12:51] because when you go out there don't just
[1:12:53] go with the outward appearance
[1:12:56] amen because
[1:12:58] impersonation the Catholic
[1:13:00] nuns beat us by far by everything that
[1:13:04] we can see by dress code by speech and
[1:13:09] everything but says I've seen so many
[1:13:13] things that the Hindus and and and all
[1:13:16] this the Muslims are able to produce
[1:13:19] more sincerity that the children the
[1:13:22] Christianity will be and ever been able
[1:13:24] to bring
[1:13:27] forth but he's bringing out the
[1:13:30] description of this woman it say who can
[1:13:33] find a virtuous woman her price is far B
[1:13:38] rubies because her life is so
[1:13:43] precious that he gave his own life for
[1:13:47] it when you have to get you yourself
[1:13:50] some
[1:13:51] bread what is more important bread or
[1:13:55] the money you have in the bank
[1:13:58] account and now you have to compare the
[1:14:00] two that's why we call the opportunity
[1:14:03] cost what are you going to do with what
[1:14:05] you
[1:14:07] have Jesus is looking at the promise he
[1:14:11] said that you promised me that I shall
[1:14:14] see my
[1:14:15] seed you've promised me that I shall
[1:14:18] bring I shall see I am fearing of the
[1:14:21] Lord I fear the lord I shall leave I
[1:14:23] shall leave I shall my children's
[1:14:27] children but where is that virtuous
[1:14:30] woman that will take my
[1:14:32] word that will be born out of me not
[1:14:35] grafted in because when he paid the C
[1:14:38] the the pay the the price of the cross
[1:14:41] the the side was open and freed the
[1:14:44] Bride of Jesus
[1:14:47] Christ but then where is
[1:14:49] she he said the heart of a husband do
[1:14:54] safely Trust trust in
[1:14:58] her she's not always debating with
[1:15:03] him if I tell her something she's going
[1:15:06] to
[1:15:08] listen butram said that's it
[1:15:12] absolute but in this hour now you know
[1:15:16] brother Bram he made some mistakes
[1:15:20] and and he's standing he's looking it's
[1:15:23] like you know elzar pass pass pass pass
[1:15:29] pass as simple as it
[1:15:31] is it goes against all the beliefs that
[1:15:35] we have in the world
[1:15:37] today she has a say
[1:15:41] too she's not your
[1:15:44] slave you can tell her what to
[1:15:50] do but she's clean She's Fit she's well
[1:15:54] spoken
[1:15:56] she earns
[1:15:59] well she wants to bring her own
[1:16:03] Merit then we know what type of seed is
[1:16:06] that can
[1:16:08] seed bringing our own things at the
[1:16:11] altar they said no it's not about you I
[1:16:16] will do the
[1:16:17] work but she doesn't like
[1:16:22] that it's a 5050 world you know
[1:16:28] Jesus say one thing I say one thing
[1:16:29] Jesus say one thing I say one
[1:16:32] thing a 5050
[1:16:37] world and I don't need to get into the
[1:16:41] families you can see it's the
[1:16:46] word if it's the Original
[1:16:49] Seed if she's not grafted
[1:16:52] in bringing her own ideas
[1:16:55] but if she is part of him born out of
[1:17:00] him there's no
[1:17:03] debate have you ever met your your
[1:17:07] soulmate we never
[1:17:10] debate we never
[1:17:14] argue is it
[1:17:16] because he's
[1:17:19] stupid is it because she doesn't
[1:17:22] understand anything she has all the
[1:17:26] faculties he has all the
[1:17:29] faculties but they understand their
[1:17:32] position in the
[1:17:35] body they understand God's
[1:17:39] program mtin Luther King couldn't
[1:17:42] understand
[1:17:46] that take that and dig deeper into it I
[1:17:49] can finish
[1:17:53] everything the part of her husband do
[1:17:56] safely trust in her so that he he shall
[1:17:59] have no need of spoil she will do him
[1:18:03] good and not evil some of the days of
[1:18:06] our
[1:18:09] life it's my B days I can't go to church
[1:18:13] I can't pray I don't feel like paying
[1:18:16] the tithes you know Jesus you too you
[1:18:18] have to listen to
[1:18:21] me I'm just laying God's program you
[1:18:23] know
[1:18:25] and when we see that each one of us we
[1:18:28] understand it's not it's not necessarily
[1:18:30] about like the the the the the the young
[1:18:33] lady or the older lady or I'm talking
[1:18:36] about the
[1:18:38] church and this church when God brings
[1:18:41] it into your life we are cautious to
[1:18:44] apply it in our
[1:18:47] ministry because that's where now you're
[1:18:50] going out to see God's program in your
[1:18:53] life and then when you start seeing that
[1:18:55] you start struggling with the
[1:18:58] word then you know where your prayer
[1:19:00] meeting should begin at
[1:19:03] right because the prayer it has to be
[1:19:07] precise according to the time of need
[1:19:10] because she said do not lie to
[1:19:13] me whatever you say that I will
[1:19:17] do because we are David
[1:19:21] soldiers His Wish is what our Command
[1:19:26] Imagine David with his soldiers I wish I
[1:19:30] I have some water of Bethlehem you know
[1:19:32] the spoken word The Original Seed it's
[1:19:35] like David you know those are some some
[1:19:37] oldtime things this is 2024 we need you
[1:19:41] know you need to actualize certain
[1:19:42] things you know bring in modernized
[1:19:45] things and
[1:19:46] things you can do better than me when I
[1:19:50] was anointed by by Samuel were you there
[1:19:56] when all authority was given to me on
[1:19:59] Earth and in
[1:20:01] heaven when I came and I claimed the
[1:20:04] book and I opened the seals job where
[1:20:08] were you when I was laying the
[1:20:09] foundation of the
[1:20:11] world could you tell what the first seal
[1:20:15] was and now you come and you want to
[1:20:18] tell me what to
[1:20:22] do we need to understand God
[1:20:25] program we need to see
[1:20:28] him and he's showing that he said like
[1:20:31] you know she Seth wool and fla and work
[1:20:35] of
[1:20:39] willingly this is not some pushy
[1:20:42] matters you got and you offended Brother
[1:20:45] Martin did this no no no no it's not
[1:20:47] about Brother Martin the Bible say she
[1:20:49] worketh
[1:20:52] willingly in the book of of Deuteronomy
[1:20:55] I believe it said like you know tell the
[1:20:57] children of Israel Exodus tell the
[1:21:00] children of Israel to bring the gift
[1:21:04] willingly to build the altar to build
[1:21:07] the Tabernacle God willing that's what
[1:21:09] we'll see
[1:21:10] next to build it you have to do it
[1:21:16] willingly otherwise just continue with
[1:21:18] your path by God's grace
[1:21:22] anyways he said she is like the merchant
[1:21:25] sheep she's not the merchant ship she is
[1:21:27] like the merchant sheep she bringeth her
[1:21:30] food from afar she gets in the
[1:21:34] message she digs deep into it she
[1:21:37] doesn't just wait uh Wednesday night and
[1:21:40] come and we listen for an hour sermon
[1:21:42] some of things we don't understand we
[1:21:44] don't agree with it and then we wait for
[1:21:46] the next service and no no no no no she
[1:21:49] brings it from afar she
[1:21:52] labors she works
[1:21:55] she listen to the tapes every day
[1:21:58] willingly it's a love story let me sit
[1:22:01] with you let me hear from you do not lie
[1:22:04] to me open the Revelation I need to have
[1:22:08] more information so I can see Jesus and
[1:22:12] his
[1:22:13] program because the more I hear the more
[1:22:17] I desire to know tell me more the more I
[1:22:21] am hearing the more I am conscious the
[1:22:24] more I know how to
[1:22:27] labor because if I don't know how to
[1:22:30] labor how am I going to do it if I have
[1:22:33] an uncertain sound if all these messages
[1:22:36] some pushy things you know reduce the
[1:22:39] woman and and put the women in the
[1:22:41] kitchen and and all these things here
[1:22:43] laws and regulations and we're missing
[1:22:45] God's program then what's the point of
[1:22:47] it we are not different like America you
[1:22:50] do one thing that put you in jail and if
[1:22:52] you you do uh you do good according to
[1:22:55] the law they give you a title Law
[1:22:57] Abiding Citizen no it's not about Law
[1:22:59] Abiding Citizen it's about the seed
[1:23:02] coming
[1:23:04] in and he wants that seed
[1:23:08] in because even the law abiding citizens
[1:23:11] before you know it they find some cases
[1:23:15] they gave you the key to the city of New
[1:23:18] York and then tomorrow they come and
[1:23:19] they take you the key but then when he
[1:23:22] was given the key of hell and the grave
[1:23:26] that's
[1:23:29] it you didn't catch that one did
[1:23:36] you there was a man in the land famous
[1:23:41] guy named per daddy
[1:23:45] PDD famous known of
[1:23:49] all he was given the key to the city of
[1:23:52] New York a very good represent
[1:23:55] representative everybody looked up to
[1:23:59] him but then afterward the F of stuff
[1:24:02] about
[1:24:03] him and quickly the mayor came and took
[1:24:06] back the
[1:24:08] key but with the Lord Jesus since he
[1:24:11] took that
[1:24:13] key nothing
[1:24:15] else when he took that away from the
[1:24:18] devil we can go back there we have given
[1:24:22] the freedom forever
[1:24:25] there's nothing he was tested tempted in
[1:24:28] all points yet without
[1:24:34] sin she riseth also while it is yet
[1:24:38] night and giveth meat to her household
[1:24:40] and a portion of her maidens she
[1:24:42] consider a field and buth
[1:24:45] it like in the land of Mella she bu of
[1:24:49] the land because she understands the
[1:24:51] time and the season he said like you
[1:24:53] know do not do not lay me down just in
[1:24:56] the six seals but bury me in that
[1:24:58] seventh one she buth the land with the
[1:25:02] fruit of her hands she planteth her a
[1:25:05] Vineyard she GTH her loins with the
[1:25:09] strength and the strength in her HS she
[1:25:12] perceiveth that her merchandise is good
[1:25:16] her candle go goeth not out by night she
[1:25:20] sees the time that's why in Matthew 254
[1:25:24] but the wise took the oil in the v The
[1:25:28] Vessel with the lamps she keeping the
[1:25:31] oil because she knows that the night is
[1:25:34] drawing nigh thick Darkness upon the
[1:25:37] world sudden destruction is coming but
[1:25:40] for her to be able to navigate the world
[1:25:43] she must keep the oil she must keep the
[1:25:46] seed she might must keep that the lamp
[1:25:49] trimed at all times and the Bible say
[1:25:52] like you know she G of herself she
[1:25:54] strengthens her hand she's working
[1:25:57] willingly she said she lay verse 19 she
[1:26:00] lay her hand to to the spindle and and
[1:26:04] uh and her hands hold hold the hold the
[1:26:08] this stuff in other in um version it
[1:26:11] says she's working the wool to be able
[1:26:14] to make her
[1:26:17] garment Revelation 19:7 let us be glad
[1:26:21] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[1:26:24] the marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[1:26:27] wife her bride have made herself ready
[1:26:30] and to her was granted that she should
[1:26:34] she should be array in fine linen clean
[1:26:38] and white for the fine linen is the
[1:26:41] righteousness of
[1:26:43] saints all a work that she was
[1:26:46] doing all strengthening her hands being
[1:26:50] conscious of sitting under Elijah's
[1:26:53] Ministry
[1:26:54] being cautious of this program knowing
[1:26:57] exactly what she's called on
[1:26:59] to if you a
[1:27:01] deacon the righteousness of the Saints
[1:27:05] it's your
[1:27:06] ministry if you're a song leader if you
[1:27:10] musician and whatever position that
[1:27:12] you're holding in the church that's
[1:27:14] where the focus
[1:27:16] is she stretch out her hand her hand to
[1:27:20] the poor
[1:27:21] yeah she reaches uh reacheth forth her
[1:27:25] hand to the needy she is not afraid of
[1:27:28] the snow for her household for all her
[1:27:31] household are cloth with Scarlet you can
[1:27:34] see all the Mysteries that is coming out
[1:27:36] of this bride's Ministry a house covered
[1:27:40] by the blood of Jesus Christ The Scarlet
[1:27:42] she make herself coverings of tapestry
[1:27:45] and clothing silk and and purple I
[1:27:48] believe uh brother um Mario spoke about
[1:27:51] the purple adoption you can see all the
[1:27:54] trajectory of the word her husband is
[1:27:57] known in the gates when he sth among the
[1:28:02] of the
[1:28:04] land he is the one who shall see his
[1:28:07] seed in Revelation 5 sitting there in
[1:28:10] the midst of the
[1:28:12] elders they said like you know I have a
[1:28:14] bride when the sons of God were sitting
[1:28:17] there and the devil came among the
[1:28:20] elders and the Lord said if you seen my
[1:28:24] servant
[1:28:25] job it's said you know you know is
[1:28:28] that's just an outward appearing you
[1:28:29] have given him this and you know good
[1:28:32] health and money and big church and all
[1:28:35] these things say know you think so I
[1:28:38] think like you know that's the seed of
[1:28:40] my
[1:28:41] seed that's the bone of my bone you want
[1:28:44] to go thirst him yeah yeah yeah yeah go
[1:28:46] ahead go go ahead go ahead before you
[1:28:49] know it the true nature came
[1:28:52] out in those time of
[1:28:55] Trials brother bam says I've seen
[1:28:57] brother brother uh Joseph in uh he
[1:29:02] said I've had
[1:29:04] friends I've had
[1:29:06] people that I could call by
[1:29:09] friends but
[1:29:11] Joseph every time even when I was wrong
[1:29:14] he was always with
[1:29:16] me he said that's when you know who
[1:29:19] really is your
[1:29:21] friend that's why we're doing the
[1:29:23] message you know yeah brother God bless
[1:29:26] you brother God bless you as long as he
[1:29:28] she's coming to
[1:29:31] church but it's when they are in the
[1:29:34] lowest point weakest Point that's why we
[1:29:39] understand God's
[1:29:41] Ministry I'm laying all these things I'm
[1:29:44] saying like you know I'm closing out
[1:29:45] because if we have to take all these
[1:29:47] things start breaking it down you can
[1:29:49] see it's a lot of
[1:29:51] material but let God give it to you to
[1:29:55] you watch the pattern watch what God is
[1:29:59] bringing
[1:30:00] out what come the work you have to
[1:30:04] do and reach out to the
[1:30:07] poor poor in spirit the younger ones in
[1:30:11] the
[1:30:12] faith teach them how to
[1:30:14] grow give them food that's what the
[1:30:17] virtuous woman was
[1:30:20] doing elazar when you go out there you
[1:30:23] said Lord
[1:30:24] to whom unto whom I shall just preach
[1:30:27] that sermon but by
[1:30:29] herself we go and dig deeper that's the
[1:30:35] one she came out she just didn't stop
[1:30:38] with the sermon at the pit but she took
[1:30:41] it she took the notes what reference is
[1:30:43] that where what what message is that she
[1:30:47] doesn't just come to church and sits
[1:30:48] there no notebook not taking note and
[1:30:50] anything you know yeah we'll see let's
[1:30:53] wait for another sermon now she's
[1:30:55] cautious of the
[1:30:59] time
[1:31:02] amen will I be able to finish probably
[1:31:04] not but but because
[1:31:08] Grace she's
[1:31:12] conscious fin L and the righteousness of
[1:31:14] the saint verse
[1:31:16] 20 say stretch of her hand to the poor
[1:31:19] she make herself covering 23 her husband
[1:31:22] is not in the gate 24
[1:31:25] she make a fine linen and sth it and
[1:31:30] deliver it and deliver g g uh deliver
[1:31:35] goodles unto the merchants strength and
[1:31:38] honor her her clothing and she shall
[1:31:42] rejoice in time to
[1:31:45] come Revelation
[1:31:47] 1412 here is the patience of the
[1:31:51] Saints here are they that keep the
[1:31:54] Commandment of
[1:31:55] God and the faith of
[1:31:58] Jesus and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:32:01] saying unto me right blessed are the
[1:32:04] dead which die in the Lord from
[1:32:08] henceforth yeah send the yeah save the
[1:32:12] spirit that they may rest from their
[1:32:17] labor and The Works do what follow them
[1:32:24] this virtuous
[1:32:26] woman she was not a lazy
[1:32:29] person read uh proverb 31 she was
[1:32:35] conscious of God's
[1:32:38] program because if we do not have God's
[1:32:41] program with
[1:32:42] us we just come to church this is just
[1:32:46] another sermon probably hard to
[1:32:49] understand this is just another thing to
[1:32:51] probably have another debate
[1:32:54] this is another thing probably like you
[1:32:56] know to just like you know shove off
[1:32:58] the shove off the
[1:33:01] shoulders but then when it's God's
[1:33:04] bride when she sees the
[1:33:07] program that he must see his children's
[1:33:12] children because the woman had the
[1:33:16] Revelation do not lie to
[1:33:19] me I'm looking for to I'm looking uh I
[1:33:23] need to bring forth that
[1:33:25] child that child must come through
[1:33:28] me I am that virtuous
[1:33:31] woman I must look into my Ministry I
[1:33:34] like you know this is born of my
[1:33:36] Ministry this one is born of my
[1:33:39] ministry that's why when William Brenham
[1:33:42] went over there his Works followed
[1:33:44] him do you know that man that woman you
[1:33:47] know I did not know know her you know
[1:33:49] yeah you brought her to Christ her I
[1:33:52] don't remember her she was in the
[1:33:55] 90s her work his Works followed
[1:34:01] him William brandham you're
[1:34:04] dying you're getting hold if there's
[1:34:08] anything that you can do for the Lord
[1:34:10] you better do it
[1:34:12] quick you better do it
[1:34:14] quick that's a virtuous woman then you
[1:34:18] start now seeing that par now throughout
[1:34:20] the
[1:34:21] message this guy was not
[1:34:24] rest two three services in one day the
[1:34:29] next day is up
[1:34:31] again but then for us to make one
[1:34:34] service it's hard in a
[1:34:38] week for us to listen to the tape along
[1:34:41] the week it's
[1:34:44] hard I'm busy I have to go to work I
[1:34:47] have
[1:34:48] to didn't God tell you ask what you will
[1:34:54] according to God's
[1:34:55] word for him to put you in a condition
[1:34:59] that will allow you to serve him in
[1:35:02] season out of
[1:35:03] season do you see that woman that
[1:35:06] virtuous woman her position her
[1:35:10] understanding under the
[1:35:12] ministry receiving the time of
[1:35:16] visitation we are called to be that
[1:35:19] woman we are that
[1:35:22] woman we are born that
[1:35:25] woman then where's the
[1:35:28] child where's the
[1:35:30] conception seeing Jesus in his
[1:35:34] program he's getting married he's
[1:35:36] getting married the head came down to do
[1:35:40] what to sit
[1:35:41] down no the promise is there Isaiah said
[1:35:46] he shall see what he
[1:35:50] se he paid the
[1:35:52] price for for he to fail with Martin
[1:35:55] Luther to miss the
[1:35:57] goal to be caught up into communism and
[1:36:01] fascism and and the
[1:36:03] nism
[1:36:05] no the program is
[1:36:08] set God's word does not return void
[1:36:12] without doing what fulfilling the
[1:36:15] purpose and are with that purpose are we
[1:36:19] the ground are we the vine are we the
[1:36:23] the Branch yes sir are we producing
[1:36:26] those fruits are we called to be the
[1:36:29] fruitful Vine are we called to to
[1:36:32] prepare the
[1:36:33] vineyard are we supposed to to to buy
[1:36:36] the
[1:36:38] land and all in heaven on Earth was what
[1:36:43] given to who to
[1:36:45] him and when we stay in the presence of
[1:36:48] the king what does the king tell us all
[1:36:51] that you require of me
[1:36:54] I will do even what half of my
[1:36:58] kingdom is that true is that is is it
[1:37:03] the same yesterday today and
[1:37:04] forever and if it's the same yesterday
[1:37:07] today and forever shall he fulfill what
[1:37:08] he said
[1:37:10] yesterday didn't we tell him that L do
[1:37:12] not lie to
[1:37:14] us is there anything impossible to
[1:37:18] God do you know what God cannot
[1:37:22] do he cannot fail that's right God
[1:37:26] cannot
[1:37:27] lie it's not in him we told him to do
[1:37:31] not lie to us we've seen you along the
[1:37:34] church ages we've built the altar we'
[1:37:38] put the bread we put the
[1:37:41] Candlestick and at the end of the ages
[1:37:44] now we end up with a Martin Luther King
[1:37:49] Jr do we see God's program I believe
[1:37:52] this series was a blessing to some of
[1:37:55] you that we're not here about like you
[1:37:57] know cutting people short and and
[1:38:00] keeping people down like you know your
[1:38:02] position is this no no no no no no it
[1:38:04] has to be revealed unto
[1:38:07] you don't bring in your own
[1:38:10] ideas don't bring in like you know I
[1:38:12] know so I have my own opinions about the
[1:38:15] message there's no opinion of
[1:38:19] yours may God keep me from TCH to bring
[1:38:22] my own opinion up up to you and if I do
[1:38:26] please let me
[1:38:28] know because I have to answer for it and
[1:38:32] if I have to answer for it I have to
[1:38:34] show you exactly where I taken it
[1:38:36] from and if it's showing if I've shown
[1:38:39] it to you from Genesis through
[1:38:42] Revelation along the time Church ages
[1:38:44] and
[1:38:45] things then God must bring that word to
[1:38:50] fulfillment because Joseph Ministry was
[1:38:53] to be a fruitful Vine that goes beyond
[1:38:56] the
[1:38:59] walls do not just limit this like you
[1:39:01] know brother martin you said you know
[1:39:04] the place of a woman is this place of a
[1:39:06] woman is a Ministry I've said it
[1:39:08] countless
[1:39:11] time read the
[1:39:13] message different women different
[1:39:18] stages justification sanctification
[1:39:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost adoption
[1:39:26] that's the woman that's her place that's
[1:39:29] her
[1:39:30] kitchen may God bless
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:37] you amen musicians if you
[1:39:41] come amen while they're
[1:39:43] coming when you begin to see Jesus in
[1:39:46] his
[1:39:48] program the shunamite
[1:39:51] woman she discerned he was a prophet
[1:39:55] that's first thing you got to discern
[1:39:57] this message was it just a man or was it
[1:40:01] really a prophetic Ministry and when she
[1:40:03] discerned it what it did it put her into
[1:40:06] action and she provided a place see you
[1:40:10] can talk about all you but you have to
[1:40:12] provide a place you have to do something
[1:40:15] about what you've heard and when she
[1:40:18] did the prophet's message was a message
[1:40:21] of life amen it wasn't just a grafted in
[1:40:26] Vine of bringing forth Creeds dogmas
[1:40:29] nickan no but it had life she knew it
[1:40:34] she saw the program and because she
[1:40:36] discerned the ministry of Elijah she
[1:40:39] became pregnated with the
[1:40:42] seed brought
[1:40:44] forth
[1:40:46] see when she was doing what the word
[1:40:50] said do Elisha noticed what does she
[1:40:55] want does she want to go before the king
[1:40:58] she want to see the ambassadors what
[1:41:00] does she want she want a new house what
[1:41:01] does she want then he discerned and he
[1:41:04] said I know what she
[1:41:07] wants she wants
[1:41:10] seed her husband's
[1:41:13] old tell her thus sayith the Lord
[1:41:16] according to the time of
[1:41:18] life see God in his
[1:41:21] season at the appoint
[1:41:25] time God will bring his word to pass ask
[1:41:29] her what she wants she wanted
[1:41:32] seed see she doesn't want some grafted
[1:41:36] in Vite she wants thus sayith the Lord
[1:41:40] she in fact she says don't lie to
[1:41:44] me don't lie to me don't tell me I'm
[1:41:47] going to have
[1:41:48] seed don't you deceive me I put
[1:41:52] everything into this m
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:57] message you know I've put everything
[1:42:00] into this message don't you lie to
[1:42:03] [Music]
[1:42:05] me she became so
[1:42:08] desperate she came to a place of
[1:42:11] desperation I don't want Creeds dogmas I
[1:42:14] want
[1:42:16] life what about you and I this
[1:42:20] message are you Discerning it
[1:42:23] are you seeing Jesus in his
[1:42:26] program or is it just making another
[1:42:29] church order and this and that we know
[1:42:31] this no when we began to see it and
[1:42:35] discern God help us to discern this
[1:42:38] message amen because it's
[1:42:41] life amen let it produce Christ in us
[1:42:45] the hope of glory this is that
[1:42:49] mystery not only understanding him
[1:42:54] but understanding yourself you're a part
[1:42:56] of that
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:42:59] mystery that's why when he put the
[1:43:01] reflection of the word before you and
[1:43:03] you began to see and you moved and it
