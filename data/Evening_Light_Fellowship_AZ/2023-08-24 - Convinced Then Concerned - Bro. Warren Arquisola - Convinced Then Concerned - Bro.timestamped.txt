[39:39] with a sidecar
[39:43] the the this kind of profession is the
[39:46] lowest profession in the Philippines you
[39:48] don't need to go to school to to become
[39:51] a a bicycle driver
[39:55] but this guy showed the scripture he had
[40:00] a a Bible in his uh pocket
[40:03] and he showed the scripture to me about
[40:07] Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 13.
[40:11] and we Catholic we don't believe in
[40:13] reading a Bible because if we see a
[40:17] person reading a Bible we call them
[40:19] crazy
[40:21] so this guy was showing the Bible to me
[40:24] and if you don't have money in your
[40:27] pocket you will listen
[40:30] and so I was listening to him he said
[40:33] hear ye the conclusion of the whole
[40:35] matter fear God and keep his
[40:36] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[40:39] of man
[40:40] for God will bring every secret thing
[40:43] into judgment whether it be good or evil
[40:48] and when I heard that
[40:51] something struck in my heart
[40:53] I thought that the whole matter the the
[40:56] conclusion of the whole matter here is
[40:58] to just to enjoy your life
[41:00] you know eat drink and enjoy your life
[41:03] the more you die
[41:06] I believe before in reincarnation but
[41:10] because of this message because of the
[41:13] Bible
[41:14] I want to go with him
[41:17] I want to stay with him and I I told him
[41:20] can I go to your house maybe I can I can
[41:25] fellowship with you and he said let's go
[41:28] so he stopped driving the bicycle
[41:31] and I was staying there I was eating and
[41:35] he was like telling to his wife he said
[41:37] um
[41:38] uh uh he I forgot the name of the wine
[41:42] so he said
[41:44] if the Rapture will take place tonight
[41:47] Warren doesn't have a house to stay can
[41:50] we give the house to him and I was like
[41:53] where are you going
[41:56] not sure
[41:58] he said Rapture is a if you're faithful
[42:01] God will will uh bring you to the
[42:05] Rapture without seeing that
[42:07] I said I love that give me more tell me
[42:10] more about it and after that brother
[42:13] after a week
[42:15] I said I will surrender
[42:17] I will get baptized
[42:20] and I got baptized
[42:23] but then
[42:25] in my heart remember the the John
[42:28] chapter 1
[42:31] I got baptized and I was so happy I felt
[42:35] like something that the the happiness
[42:38] that that I cannot explain in my heart
[42:41] the father that I was longing because my
[42:46] my father left us when I was eight years
[42:48] old
[42:49] but then something here in my heart that
[42:52] I was so happy I cannot explain I need
[42:54] to share this to my family I need to
[42:57] share this to the people Wherever I Go
[43:00] but then I was here uh holding the Bible
[43:05] I don't care about the the my friends to
[43:09] tell me anymore about I'm crazy because
[43:11] the joy it's unspeakable joy in my heart
[43:15] so then what happened was I shared the
[43:18] Bible to the person and he challenged me
[43:21] he said I did you share this to your
[43:24] family
[43:25] I said no I just accepted the the Lord
[43:31] last week
[43:34] I don't even I was sharing the Bible I
[43:36] don't even know what this version
[43:38] chapter
[43:40] but then here
[43:41] was the the challenge of this man
[43:46] he said
[43:47] you chair to your family first
[43:50] and then if they will accept then come
[43:54] back to me
[43:57] was a challenge
[43:58] he said because you know the fire that
[44:00] you're you're you're in your heart right
[44:03] now is just like a hay fire
[44:06] you know the fire the the hey you you
[44:08] sparked the the hay and then it will
[44:11] fire so fast and uh gone
[44:14] so he was telling me that maybe next
[44:17] week you will go back to the world
[44:20] but that was the challenge so what I did
[44:24] I went to my brothers

[50:28] on my tears
[50:29] the the first church that I started um
[50:33] this is his ministry if I say I forgive
[50:37] me but this is a different vessel
[50:41] this is the the mass that right now it's
[50:44] in the fivefold ministry it's his
[50:47] ministry we're just a vessel we're just
[50:50] a microphone
[50:53] the the other Church the one with the
[50:55] kids
[50:58] the second Church
[51:01] I I go to I every
[51:05] um Monday I go back to the city and
[51:09] drive a taxi and save money me and Maria
[51:13] was helping each other just to build
[51:16] this church
[51:19] and then
[51:21] I started to the kids I was a young man
[51:24] with hair
[51:26] and the kids likes me because I like a
[51:29] story about the you know the I started
[51:31] the story about the Bible
[51:33] so the kids likes me
[51:35] and those kids right now are
[51:37] married
[51:39] people and they have kids already so
[51:42] this was 19 uh 2004.
[51:45] that was the church
[51:47] this uh next brother
[51:50] that's the church right now
[51:54] this is my older brother
[51:58] and
[51:59] because
[52:02] of
[52:04] I was convinced of this message
[52:08] now I will tell you it's not easy to
[52:10] start a church
[52:13] to start a church when I started here
[52:16] as I said I was a toxic driver
[52:19] I I told to the people
[52:22] I said I will feed you
[52:24] spiritual
[52:26] but after that God put a desire in my
[52:30] heart to feed you physical also before
[52:33] you go home I want we will eat together
[52:37] and I want that's my hardest desire I
[52:39] don't care what kind of food but we will
[52:41] eat together
[52:43] and I opened the Opera offering box
[52:47] I found one peso in the offering box
[52:52] for years I suffered to to work hard
[52:55] bring a little of money just to feed the
[52:58] people
[52:59] that's the heart of a minister we don't
[53:03] care about the money we don't care
[53:05] because God Will Supply our needs my
[53:08] favorite scripture you know what seek
[53:11] you the kingdom of God and this
[53:13] righteousness and all these things will
[53:16] be added unto you I always say it's all
[53:19] it's you this is your promise
[53:25] that's the the fruits right now
[53:29] and one soul
[53:33] is equivalent of ten thousand worlds
[53:38] how many of you
[53:40] have a desire
[53:42] from now on
[53:44] I will share your word
[53:46] that's why I ask you brother Amos last
[53:48] Sunday how many Souls did you bring to
[53:52] Christ
[53:53] because
[53:55] it's not ours but one soul brother
[53:59] the the angels from Heaven going back
[54:03] and forth enjoying that there's a
[54:05] there's a a soul that accepted to him
[54:10] amen
[54:13] um
[54:14] the last one
[54:16] that's me that's my mom
[54:21] my my dad left us when I was eight
[54:25] that's my older brother that's the
[54:27] pastor in the other church and that's my
[54:30] sister
[54:30] thank you I will preach now
[54:35] amen
[54:38] that's the ministry it's his
[54:42] now
[54:44] the world is a mess
[54:50] you know the the problem of this world
[54:53] it's not bloody Vladimir Putin
[54:56] or Xi Jinping
[54:59] you know the economy is going down and
[55:01] down
[55:03] but
[55:04] not because of the Russian war because
[55:08] of the Ukraine war
[55:11] the problem of this world are not the
[55:15] overloaded prison
[55:18] or the or or the sputniks over there in
[55:22] downtown Phoenix
[55:24] the problem of this world is sin
[55:28] and the president of the United States
[55:31] cannot fix it
[55:33] NATO cannot fix it
[55:36] it's the problem of this world is sin
[55:40] and the message in the of this hour is
[55:43] bring us is to bring us back
[55:47] when we accepted the message of the
[55:49] Malachi 4
[55:51] the great and Dreadful day and this is
[55:55] the the hour at the time that the great
[55:58] and Dreadful day is coming soon
[56:01] but before the great and Dreadful day of
[56:03] the Lord God will send Elijah the
[56:06] prophet
[56:07] to who to you and I
[56:10] to you and me
[56:13] brother the prophet said here brother
[56:15] what the word needs today is not a new
[56:18] mayor I I did not uh put that I forgot
[56:22] not a new prayer
[56:25] an old
[56:27] Saint Paul
[56:28] [Music]
[56:31] preach back in his church in its power
[56:36] we don't need any governor
[56:40] or any president we're thinking maybe uh
[56:43] this uh brother from or this man from a
[56:47] a young charismatic from Florida will
[56:50] change the United States never
[56:54] because we are heading into a wrong
[56:57] direction this is the last days we don't
[57:01] have hope anymore our hope is the coming
[57:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:07] Hallelujah
[57:09] oh brother
[57:13] he said here
[57:15] the message
[57:17] convince and then concerned
[57:21] he said and I believe
[57:24] that every man
[57:26] Every Woman every boy or girl that ever
[57:31] stayed long enough that you're convinced
[57:34] that it is right and it is the Holy
[57:38] Ghost you will burden so hard in your
[57:41] heart that you can stand still and let
[57:45] these people die like this is shame and
[57:48] sin
[57:51] it's true I cannot stay
[57:54] I told Brother James labo last week
[57:59] he said I I said do you know what
[58:02] happened last month when I went to uh to
[58:05] Rio Grande
[58:07] I said the Pastor from from Rio Grande
[58:10] asked me
[58:12] because I was telling him about the
[58:14] mission and he said you go every month
[58:16] to this country that country
[58:19] you must drive uh you're you're driving
[58:22] maybe uh Maserati
[58:26] I said brother without if I'm not going
[58:29] to the mission field I can buy Tesla X
[58:32] but because of this message
[58:35] we don't care anymore as long as we can
[58:39] share this message to the people and I
[58:42] believe God will will give us a reward
[58:46] one day not the reward of this world but
[58:49] the reward over there oh one day how
[58:52] pure and how Glory how how precious it
[58:55] is if the people that that was you won
[59:00] in the Lord will bring you as a crown
[59:05] that's a joy Brethren Amos our suffering
[59:08] here is temporal
[59:12] oh it will grind the very heart of you
[59:16] to get out here on the streets
[59:19] it does any Christian to see the people
[59:22] wholly given over to sin drinking
[59:26] gambling cursing swearing smoking every
[59:30] car that you pull up behind is a woman
[59:33] with a cigarette
[59:35] oh in their fingers with one of this
[59:38] water head haircuts
[59:42] he didn't put here with a blue colored
[59:45] hair
[59:53] there was a one
[59:56] a man from gadara
[1:00:01] you know a man from gadara
[1:00:04] the by uh the message here uh greater
[1:00:07] than Solomon is here
[1:00:10] he said you come all the way from Heaven
[1:00:15] to hear the Cry of one blind beggar
[1:00:19] you come all the way from heaven
[1:00:23] one time to answer
[1:00:26] across the uh or cross the oceans to one
[1:00:30] man that was insane
[1:00:32] the maniac of gadara
[1:00:37] he heard the Cry of the maniac from
[1:00:40] gadara
[1:00:41] and from Heaven brother
[1:00:45] he came down he didn't really care about
[1:00:48] the situation he didn't really care if
[1:00:51] the 10 000 demons will destroy him
[1:00:53] crossing the Lakes
[1:00:55] but because of the cries of the man from
[1:00:58] gadara
[1:00:59] he answered it
[1:01:01] and he came down from heaven
[1:01:04] and you know what happened he said and
[1:01:07] healed that man and returned to
[1:01:11] your home
[1:01:12] it seems like away from your topic
[1:01:14] brother Warren I thought you're talking
[1:01:16] about the about the convince and then
[1:01:18] concern well wait a minute
[1:01:21] he said
[1:01:24] he was he was lying back in the back uh
[1:01:28] in the back of the boat
[1:01:30] rocking around and the Bible said that
[1:01:33] the storm came down upon the sea and
[1:01:36] began to toss the boat the disciples
[1:01:39] said carries thou not for we perish he
[1:01:42] said oh where's your faith look around
[1:01:45] and the great winds and waves obeyed him
[1:01:48] what was he doing
[1:01:51] Crossing rough sea that night
[1:01:54] because one soul
[1:01:56] in gadara
[1:01:58] was ready to receive him
[1:02:00] one soul in gadara he would come from
[1:02:03] glory for one soul that was ready to
[1:02:07] receive him
[1:02:08] and remember this man that was ready to
[1:02:12] receive and was a sick man he was a
[1:02:15] mentally sick he was a maniac he'd lost
[1:02:18] his mind the doctor could not do nothing
[1:02:21] for him he was out into the caves and
[1:02:25] the graveyards that's the place the
[1:02:28] devil will take you will put you in the
[1:02:31] graveyard
[1:02:32] but remember when Jesus met him he was
[1:02:37] he was in chain and with the feathers in
[1:02:42] his ankles
[1:02:44] but then he always break the chains
[1:02:47] because the the demon Tower
[1:02:51] Brothers ten thousand demons can break
[1:02:55] the chain how much more the power of the
[1:02:59] Holy Ghost
[1:03:00] can't break every chain tonight
[1:03:06] brother
[1:03:07] when Jesus met him he broke the chain
[1:03:11] the chain of craziness
[1:03:15] and he was in the right mind
[1:03:18] but then all the legions wants to you
[1:03:21] know the business of that that the
[1:03:24] country
[1:03:26] was a Hormel uh sausage
[1:03:32] um bacons and everything
[1:03:34] but then because of that swine that the
[1:03:39] demons went to the swine and two
[1:03:41] thousand swines went to the cliff
[1:03:45] they lost their stocks that time Hormel
[1:03:48] went down
[1:03:52] but then
[1:03:54] the people doesn't like him
[1:03:56] but here was the man from gadara
[1:04:00] they pushed Jesus to go back
[1:04:03] to Galilee
[1:04:05] but here was the man from gadara in his
[1:04:08] right mind
[1:04:09] with the clothes
[1:04:11] Van Heusen brother one
[1:04:14] with the clothes
[1:04:16] and then they ask they ask him why this
[1:04:20] man has a clothes
[1:04:23] because he met Jesus
[1:04:26] but then he was concerned
[1:04:30] so he went with Jesus Jesus I want to be
[1:04:33] your disciple can I go with you and
[1:04:36] Jesus said in Mark chapter 5 brother
[1:04:40] 18.
[1:04:43] to 20.
[1:04:45] and when he was come into the ship he
[1:04:49] had been possessed with the devil prayed
[1:04:52] him that night to be with him how be it
[1:04:55] Jesus suffered him not
[1:04:57] but said unto him go home to thy friends
[1:05:01] and to tell them how great things the
[1:05:04] Lord had done

[1:09:03] 1.
[1:09:07] and the Hand of the Lord was upon me and
[1:09:11] carried me out in the spirit of the Lord
[1:09:13] and set me down in the midst of the
[1:09:15] valley which was full of Bones
[1:09:19] I was a bone one time
[1:09:21] we were both one time
[1:09:25] and caused me to pass by them round
[1:09:29] about and behold there were very many in
[1:09:33] the open Valley and lo we were very dry
[1:09:37] or they were very dry
[1:09:39] and he said
[1:09:41] unto me son of man can this bone live
[1:09:46] is that the answer tonight
[1:09:48] can this bone lives
[1:09:51] and he said oh God thou knowest
[1:09:55] again he said unto me prophesy upon
[1:09:58] these bones and he's saying to them oh
[1:10:00] ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord
[1:10:03] thus set the Lord God unto these bones
[1:10:06] behold I will cause bread unto them or
[1:10:10] unto you and ye shall leave and I will
[1:10:13] lay sinu upon you and I will bring up
[1:10:17] flesh upon you and covered with skin and
[1:10:21] put breadth or breathe in you and ye
[1:10:24] shall live and ye shall know that I am
[1:10:27] the Lord so I prophesied and say
[1:10:30] commanded as I prophesied there was a
[1:10:34] noise under and behold
[1:10:37] it was a shaking
[1:10:39] and the bones came together
[1:10:41] bones
[1:10:43] bone in his bone
[1:10:45] brother we experience the Pentecostal
[1:10:48] experience it was uh the the noise was
[1:10:53] so bad but then

[1:11:28] the flesh Came Upon them and the skin
[1:11:31] covered them above but here was no

[1:12:06] and they live and stood up on their feet
[1:12:10] and exceeding great Army

[1:12:34] the world
[1:12:35] amen
[1:12:37] oh brother can you can let brother

[1:14:37] to obedient believers man who were once
[1:14:40] the unbelievers be made Believers and
[1:14:42] imparted spiritual eternal life how much
[1:14:45] greater is it to say the sick woman in

[1:14:48] she'll be healed that's a great thing
[1:14:50] that's what he was doing then said
[1:14:52] greater than this should you do yes

[1:14:59] while but to give him eternal life
[1:15:02] but you'll be Eternal forever
[1:15:06] poor blind wretched people
[1:15:09] how do you miss that
[1:15:13] don't you see what the greater thing is
[1:15:15] that's the greatest thing could ever
[1:15:17] happen was to impart Eternal lives to
[1:15:20] people
[1:15:21] what is eternal life the life that he
[1:15:24] lived the life that was in him
[1:15:27] impart that to others
[1:15:30] can a man do that a Son of God Can
[1:15:33] Jesus said whosoever sins you remit to
[1:15:36] them they are remitted
[1:15:39] whosoever sin you retain to them they
[1:15:41] are retained
[1:15:43] that's right now yours were the Catholic
[1:15:44] church and many others made their big
[1:15:46] mistake they want to offer give your
[1:15:48] sins that wasn't it
[1:15:50] how did they get sins forgiven in the
[1:15:52] Bible
[1:15:53] Peter answered that question
[1:15:55] on the day of Pentecost
[1:15:57] they said what what can we do to be
[1:16:00] saved
[1:16:03] you get this that you all got
[1:16:05] he laid down the prescription yes he did
[1:16:07] he told him what to do he said repent
[1:16:11] every one of you towards God and be
[1:16:13] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:16:17] the remission of your sins
[1:16:19] [Music]
[1:16:21] how many you preachers this morning
[1:16:24] how many of you listen to my word on
[1:16:26] magnetic tape
[1:16:29] however this morning look what God did
[1:16:31] there for you thank you amen and forsake
[1:16:35] your denominational Creed and preach the
[1:16:38] gospel

[1:16:51] must be preached in his name do all the
[1:16:55] world beginning at Jerusalem
[1:16:57] [Applause]
[1:17:03] what does Calvary mean to you what'd
[1:17:05] that day do to you do stuff you out with
[1:17:08] some theology
[1:17:10] did it make you a stuffed shirt
[1:17:14] Christians sold out Hallelujah
[1:17:22] Raider Works in this shall you do you
[1:17:26] see who the yees are don't you

[1:17:31] remitting sins
[1:17:33] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:39] now my question can this bone lives
[1:17:43] thou knowest
[1:17:45] we can impart eternal life
[1:17:51] when you when I heard that brother
[1:17:54] oh there was an a Pentecostal experience
[1:17:57] in the house
[1:17:59] now
[1:18:01] the prophet here
[1:18:03] he said
[1:18:07] in the message
[1:18:11] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:18:13] he said he that believeth in me Saint
[1:18:16] John chapter 4 14 7 he that believeth in
[1:18:20] me the works that I do you shall do also
[1:18:24] or the same works and greater than this
[1:18:28] because Christ could not preach the
[1:18:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:34] oh would be greater he could not bring
[1:18:38] it to them because the Holy Ghost hadn't
[1:18:42] yet been given but when Jesus came and
[1:18:47] Sanctified his life and the Holy Ghost
[1:18:49] returned then they could impart eternal
[1:18:53] life to the people
[1:18:55] Brothers
[1:18:57] we can Empower impart light to the
[1:19:00] peoples
[1:19:01] not only praying for the sick
[1:19:04] but to impart life
[1:19:07] make them an army
[1:19:11] Hallelujah
[1:19:13] the sign and wonders Jesus plainly said
[1:19:17] in Mark 16 going into all the world and
[1:19:21] preach the gospel to Every Creature how
[1:19:23] far all the world how many every
[1:19:26] creatures
[1:19:29] long as the gospel is being preached
[1:19:31] this sign shall follow to them that
[1:19:35] believe
[1:19:36] can you see can you see what I I saw
[1:19:40] the sign
[1:19:42] will follow you
[1:19:46] you don't beg for a sign because when
[1:19:50] you you accepted the commission of the
[1:19:52] Lord the sign is following us
[1:19:56] okay
[1:19:57] Glory
[1:20:01] my
[1:20:04] the prophet said here
[1:20:08] would the bride the question would the
[1:20:11] bride of Christ
[1:20:13] have a Ministry before the rapture
[1:20:16] sure
[1:20:18] that's what's going on right now
[1:20:21] see the bride of Christ certainly
[1:20:24] it is the message of the hour
[1:20:27] the bride of Christ sure she is consists
[1:20:31] with apostles
[1:20:33] prophets teachers evangelists and
[1:20:36] pastors is that right the bride of
[1:20:40] Christ sure she's got a Ministry
[1:20:44] great ministry
[1:20:46] but they're unknown
[1:20:49] because they're not popping up or
[1:20:51] brother Stephen was telling uh uh how do
[1:20:54] you say it brother Stephen it was a
[1:20:57] prideful
[1:21:00] it's a very great ministry Ministry of
[1:21:05] the hour but it's so humble
[1:21:09] I like that
[1:21:13] we're unknown but yet well known
[1:21:19] the prophet said here
[1:21:21] notice what Harmony
[1:21:23] Jesus never did anything until sin the
[1:21:26] father or the father shown him first the
[1:21:30] harmony between God and Christ John 5 19
[1:21:34] so will the bride and he shows her his
[1:21:39] Word of Life
[1:21:41] he shows her and she receives it now
[1:21:46] look at this God and Jesus now it's
[1:21:49] Jesus and us
[1:21:53] the bride of Christ
[1:21:55] she receives it
[1:21:57] she never doubts it
[1:22:00] nothing can harm her not even death for
[1:22:04] it it is the uh the seed be planted the
[1:22:08] water will raise it up again amen then I
[1:22:11] got a great big Hallelujah
[1:22:15] here is the secret
[1:22:18] the word is in the bride
[1:22:24] don't wait for the Baptist to go to the
[1:22:26] Philippines
[1:22:27] or to go to to Cambodia or to Africa
[1:22:34] the mouthpiece of God is not the Baptist
[1:22:37] the mouthpiece of God is the message of
[1:22:39] the hour and it's in flesh with the
[1:22:42] Believers
[1:22:45] they do only his will
[1:22:49] not our will
[1:22:51] simple humble
[1:22:54] but but I believe that no one can
[1:22:57] persuade them different
[1:23:00] they have that set the Lord or they keep
[1:23:03] still
[1:23:04] then they will do greater or do the
[1:23:08] works of God for it is himself the
[1:23:11] continuing
[1:23:13] the word to fulfill
[1:23:15] he said he did complete in his days all
[1:23:19] things when he was here
[1:23:22] he did not complete all when he was here

[1:27:44] Israel to Babylon
[1:27:46] their name
[1:27:48] is or I forgot the name but but the
[1:27:52] Babylonian gave them a names about their
[1:27:55] gods they called them sadrach Meshach
[1:27:58] and Abednego

[1:28:47] they don't want to bow down to the image
[1:28:49] they know who Daniel is that's their
[1:28:52] brother
[1:28:53] why you want me to bow down to the image
[1:28:55] of Daniel
[1:28:57] but here's the here's the people
[1:29:00] they want him to to put in the fiery
[1:29:03] furnace
[1:29:06] because of their belief that there's
[1:29:10] only one God
[1:29:11] and that is the god of of Abraham
[1:29:15] Isaac and Jacob
[1:29:19] and Joseph

[1:29:24] of us
[1:29:26] that's our God
[1:29:28] will nothing about down to the image
[1:29:32] but then here's the people they want to
[1:29:35] put him into the into the fiery furnace
[1:29:38] but here's the the they were convinced
[1:29:41] that even though we are here in
[1:29:44] captivity the task Masters was whipping
[1:29:48] us every day
[1:29:49] but one day I believe that God will
[1:29:53] release us from captivity because it's
[1:29:56] almost time
[1:29:58] it's 68 years they were reading their
[1:30:01] scroll
[1:30:02] 68 years two years left
[1:30:07] but then here they put them to to to
[1:30:11] fiery furnace
[1:30:13] remember the prophet said there was no
[1:30:15] music over there young people
[1:30:17] there was no Fellowship over there
[1:30:20] they stood by themselves
[1:30:26] can you believe
[1:30:28] you're by yourself in the midst of
[1:30:30] Philadelphia
[1:30:31] people over there putting uh drugs in
[1:30:36] their hands
[1:30:37] but you're there
[1:30:39] standing with your faith
[1:30:43] they were convinced
[1:30:45] that there's only one God the god of
[1:30:48] Abraham
[1:30:49] Isaac Joseph but here in 17
[1:30:53] 3 17.
[1:30:55] this is the statement of the three
[1:30:58] Hebrew children's
[1:31:00] if it's bestow Our God whom we serve is
[1:31:05] able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[1:31:08] fiery furnace
[1:31:10] and he will deliver us out of thine hand
[1:31:13] O King
[1:31:15] but if not
[1:31:19] but if not
[1:31:21] be it known unto thee O King that we
[1:31:25] will not serve thy Gods nor worship the
[1:31:28] golden image which thou has set up
[1:31:32] it changed my topic brother
[1:31:35] they were convinced that the God will
[1:31:38] deliver them
[1:31:44] but here
[1:31:46] Far Far Away From Heaven
[1:31:49] stood Michael
[1:31:52] and wormwood
[1:31:56] let me call
[1:31:58] they were standing by you
[1:32:02] let me go
[1:32:06] and God said you're faithful to be
[1:32:08] wormwood
[1:32:11] to me

[1:32:39] not to them right now
[1:32:43] and they said but who will go oh Lord
[1:32:47] and he stepped down promise from his
[1:32:50] throne
[1:32:51] [Applause]
[1:32:53] I will go in there
[1:32:56] I will go with them
[1:32:58] because they were convinced that the god
[1:33:03] that they serve is not only with one
[1:33:05] true God

[1:58:31] this happened today I think it was today
[1:58:34] did I call you today was that today when
[1:58:37] I called you yeah yeah yeah I was just
[1:58:40] gonna share this uh
[1:58:43] sorry
[1:58:45] just it goes with the service um
[1:58:48] [Music]
[1:58:50] you know I love think thank you brother
[1:58:52] Warren that's a beautiful service I I
[1:58:55] just think we all have a Ministry you
[1:58:57] know and we are Christ and flesh and we
[1:59:00] do have something to do and it's not
[1:59:03] just coming to church it's being the
[1:59:05] church
[1:59:06] and so I uh I was going and bidding a
[1:59:10] job most of you guys know I I'm a
[1:59:12] painter
[1:59:13] and I I don't know who I'm going to meet
[1:59:16] most of the time so I just show up and I
[1:59:18] was referred to this guy by a
[1:59:20] professional baseball player that you
[1:59:23] know was happy with our stuff and so he
[1:59:26] referred us to his neighbor and I show
[1:59:27] up in this guy's got this huge house
[1:59:30] and I was intrigued by his last name
[1:59:33] because it it says toifu and if you know
[1:59:37] German that means devil
[1:59:39] and I'm like oh man I'm going to meet
[1:59:41] the devil
[1:59:44] so you know I come in and I meet this
[1:59:47] guy
[1:59:48] I introduce myself and I said you know I
[1:59:51] just got to say it I says I'm sure you
[1:59:53] know what your name means
[1:59:55] and I said I was taught to stay away
[1:59:57] from you
[2:00:00] and you know what that might seem like
[2:00:03] something so simple but it broke the ice
[2:00:08] and we started talking about God
[2:00:10] you know you wonder sometimes how do you
[2:00:12] witness or how do you be just something
[2:00:16] so simple like that and this man started
[2:00:18] asking me questions about my faith
[2:00:21] and I thought how simple it is to be a
[2:00:24] Christian
[2:00:25] like this brother you know I thought how
[2:00:27] simple he this this guy he just read a
[2:00:31] scripture in Ecclesiastes and he was on
[2:00:33] fire and I'm like his heart was burning
[2:00:36] and I think thank you Lord for for the
[2:00:40] the bicycle guy that said challenged him
[2:00:43] or whatever you know and I and I I I
[2:00:46] started talking to this guy a little bit
[2:00:48] more anyways he owns like eight
[2:00:50] McDonald's and he's a very successful
[2:00:52] man but he loves surfing
[2:00:54] well he started talking where he served
[2:00:57] and where he came from and mentioned a
[2:00:59] few names and because
[2:01:00] brother Ron was a surfer I was like man
[2:01:04] I gotta call my dad
[2:01:06] I'm like he knows some of the same guys
[2:01:08] and so I called Dad and you know dad
[2:01:12] answered and
[2:01:13] started talking a little bit
[2:01:16] and
[2:01:17] he got off the like we got off the phone
[2:01:20] with him and
[2:01:22] he says man your dad is a very
[2:01:24] interesting man and I said you know
[2:01:27] what's interesting about my dad
[2:01:30] is his passion was for surfing
[2:01:33] but he gave a passion for purpose
[2:01:37] and it just stuck
[2:01:40] and this guy goes I love it he goes I
[2:01:44] gotta meet him now
[2:01:46] so we're gonna have lunch with this
[2:01:49] devil next week and we'll see where the
[2:01:52] Lord takes it you know but you know
[2:01:54] lunch with the devil can happen
[2:01:57] you know the man from gadura right think
[2:02:01] about that

[2:02:08] dear heavenly father Lord we just thank
[2:02:10] you for the service tonight and I just
[2:02:12] pray that each one of us would be
[2:02:14] pricked in our hearts Lord and if your
[2:02:17] Prophet would say I'm way behind
[2:02:21] how much more we should feel the
[2:02:22] challenge of the hour
[2:02:25] because if you're convinced and who you
[2:02:28] are
[2:02:29] and where you're going you'd want to
[2:02:31] take everybody with you help us Lord
[2:02:34] help us to be salty help us to just let
[2:02:38] you be the words Lord we're nothing
[2:02:40] we're nobodies
[2:02:42] but Lord if we'll just yield ourselves
[2:02:44] Lord you could use us and speak through
[2:02:46] us because it is so humble but you can
[2:02:50] use that humility Lord we love you we
[2:02:53] pray that you would give brother Warren
[2:02:54] the strength and keep that zip in his
[2:02:58] step and
[2:02:59] you know even help him with his English
[2:03:01] because I feel like if he could speak
[2:03:03] English like I could my goodness we'd
[2:03:06] had a Revival tonight but I pray that
[2:03:08] you would bless him father and just just
[2:03:11] add to his faith and knowledge and and
[2:03:14] Temperance and prudence and all these
[2:03:16] things Lord that come with it and may He
[2:03:18] just continue to bring fruits for you

[2:03:24] as we go our separate ways and those who
