[9:23] We have a need here for the BIA family.
[9:25] Please pray for the Bia family. Brother
[9:27] Jean Pierre Bi has lost his mother today
[9:29] in the Congo. So let's just pray for the
[9:31] BIA family right now. Brother Amos has
[9:34] turned in a request. Please pray for
[9:36] sister Miriam Martin. She was ice
[9:38] skating with Flo and Liam yesterday and
[9:40] fell on the ice. She by God's grace did
[9:42] not break anything but has a hematoma on
[9:44] her thigh. So thanking the Lord it
[9:47] wasn't worse and
[9:49] still needing a touch from her. Amen.
[9:51] Brother James, if you would come, we
[9:53] have a couple praise reports as well.
[9:56] This is from Sister Lupe. On August 1st,
[9:58] I started experiencing pain on my
[9:59] shoulder all the way down to my fingers.
[10:02] I had an MRI done and it showed three
[10:04] bulging discs on my spine and on the
[10:06] neck area. An ortho specialist gave me
[10:08] the option of surgery or physical
[10:10] therapy. I chose to go to my first
[10:12] session. When they saw that I had zero
[10:15] and 100% mobility, I was told that I
[10:18] didn't need to go back. So, we praise
[10:19] the Lord for touching Sister Lupe.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. James, if you could [applause]
[10:23] Amen. Let's give him a hand clap.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Father, first we want to give you praise
[10:36] and thanks for [music]
[10:38] who you are and what you've called us to
[10:40] be, oh God.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, what a blessed people we are to be
[10:47] called in this hour to be chosen. And
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, to have ISAB to see of what you're
[10:52] doing in this age and
[10:54] &gt;&gt; the word that you're unfolding unto us,
[10:56] oh God. And we're just asking that we
[10:59] have gathered on a Wednesday night. Set
[11:01] aside the cares of life and the things
[11:03] that we [music]
[11:05] that can just hinder us in our walk with
[11:07] you and we would you who is the author
[11:09] and the finisher of our faith who knows
[11:12] the end from the beginning. And Lord,
[11:14] you know all the in between. And so this
[11:17] evening, we set aside all of that and we
[11:19] look to you, oh God,
[11:21] &gt;&gt; and we want to draw strength from your
[11:23] word and from your presence. And Lord,
[11:26] we we just want to say we love and
[11:28] appreciate you. And we want to give you
[11:30] thanks, oh God, and you see these needs
[11:34] that have been pinned down in faith,
[11:36] Lord, knowing that you've already done a
[11:39] work in them, oh God. And we're just
[11:41] asking and believing. And Lord, I'm sure
[11:44] there's many more needs upon the hearts
[11:46] of your people that Lord, by the lifting
[11:48] of their hands that they can raise their
[11:50] hands in faith and say, "God, I have a
[11:52] need and I have a desire." And Lord, you
[11:54] can meet it according to your word and
[11:56] your will and your purpose, oh God. So
[11:59] come by once again and we want to make
[12:01] you the guest of honor, oh God, this
[12:03] evening. We feel your presence already.

[12:08] foolishness of preaching, oh God, have
[12:10] an effect in our lives? be with the song
[12:13] service and allow us to get into the
[12:15] atmosphere of worship and of praise. And

[22:24] little report to give you. It's it's
[22:26] been about nine months since I've seen
[22:28] my cardiologist and uh everything and
[22:31] and so uh I went and saw a doctor the
[22:34] other yesterday and I got all my blood
[22:37] work back and there was a couple things
[22:39] there that need a little adjustment and
[22:42] uh he suggested some vitamins and
[22:44] everything. Other than that, uh, uh,
[22:46] everything looked good, but I went in
[22:48] today and had an angiogram and an EKG,
[22:51] and my doctor says, "You've got severe
[22:55] aortic stenosis of the aortic valve."
[22:58] And he said, "You need a valve
[22:59] replacement." And he said, "So, um, he
[23:02] said, you went from a 1.5 to a 0.9." And
[23:06] he said, "That's urgent." And he said,
[23:08] "If it was a degree or so down, it would
[23:11] be an emergency." He said, "So, uh, when
[23:14] he came in, he didn't ask me, "Do you
[23:17] want to do it?" He said, "We're going to
[23:19] do it. We're going to get it done as
[23:21] soon as possible." And then, "Yes, doc."
[23:22] Okay, whatever.
[23:25] And listen, um, you know, I just believe
[23:28] that God does use doctors,
[23:31] &gt;&gt; huh? Otherwise, you would have to say
[23:34] that they're not of God. Then none of
[23:36] you go. You break an arm, you have your
[23:38] sickness, you got pneumonia, don't go.
[23:40] Just stay home. Um, in other words,
[23:43] listen, God does use doctors and so we
[23:45] thank God for that. And um uh they want
[23:49] to do what they call a a taver, a trans
[23:53] aortic valve replacement where they
[23:55] don't open the the the chest, but they
[23:58] can go through the femoral artery, come
[24:00] in. And they showed me pictures of it
[24:03] and then they go up that aortic uh aorta
[24:07] and go into the valve and then they oh
[24:10] they they balloon it open with a stent
[24:13] like and then they replace it with a
[24:15] another valve. And I said, "Wow." And he
[24:17] I said, "How how long will I be in the
[24:19] hospital?" "Just overnight. You'll be
[24:21] out the next day."
[24:22] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Wow." [laughter]
[24:25] Yeah. Okay. Just don't cut me open. You

[25:26] I've got a lot of miles on this. I had a
[25:28] heart transplant in 1971.
[25:31] God took the old
[25:33] &gt;&gt; transplant.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; I had a heart transplant.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; 1971.

[25:53] LYING. Telling you the truth."
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so God is a heart specialist.
[25:58] How many of you had have had heart work?
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Ah yeah, you've had heart work. But this
[26:03] old body that we got, it breaks down. My
[26:05] eyes are going bad. My earring hearing
[26:08] is going bad. And uh you know Yeah. And
[26:11] the doctor asked me, he says, "Well, you
[26:14] know these s symptoms? Do you do you
[26:16] have any symptoms of this?" Well, what
[26:19] are they? And he says, "Well, kind of
[26:20] shortness of breath and you get tired
[26:23] easy and everything." I said, "Doc, I'm
[26:25] 72." That, you know, I you know, talk to
[26:28] the brothers on the the morning
[26:30] breakfast Monday morning. We all got
[26:33] that. We're all saying, "Yeah, man. I

[26:37] morning." You know? [laughter]
[26:40] So, he says, "No." He says, "Actually,"
[26:42] he said, "probably after that," he says,
[26:44] "you'll find out that with more blood
[26:48] flow, you you won't feel as tired." And
[26:51] honestly, uh, Sunday morning when I
[26:53] preach, when I'm done, I'm
[26:56] &gt;&gt; worked over. I'm done. Yeah, I'm well

[27:17] everything like this. And he said,
[27:19] "Well, I suggest um that uh Brother
[27:23] Jonathan sing before you give that
[27:26] testimony." He created me a clean heart.

[31:20] Oh, freedom [singing and music]
[31:22] is here
[31:27] and I believe [music]
[31:30] it.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe it?
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Because where the spirit of the Lord is,
[31:38] there's liberty. There is freedom.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; I want to greet you all in the name of
[31:42] our Lord Jesus Christ because in his
[31:45] name there is always power.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is healing.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is deliverance.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; And we believe that he is here
[31:54] &gt;&gt; according to his promise.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; So I would like to greet you all in the
[31:57] name of our Lord Jesus Christ and also
[32:00] bring greetings from the saints in
[32:02] Ottawa.
[32:04] So I was there last November 1st and
[32:07] 2nd. So it's just a new church maybe a
[32:10] young church uh four four months I
[32:13] think. So they have their first
[32:17] communion on last November the 1st. So I
[32:21] preach for them November 1st and
[32:24] November 2nd. Then on November the 9th
[32:27] I'm in Petroia. So I also bring
[32:30] greetings from the saints in Petroia and
[32:33] I want to thank each and everyone for
[32:37] remembering us in prayer where we were
[32:38] there.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So our travel is too smooth and
[32:42] really feel the presence of the Lord. Uh
[32:46] while we fly back uh there's no
[32:49] cancellations of our flight, no
[32:52] rescheduling.
[32:53] Uh although we have uh delayed for a few
[32:56] hours, it's understandable because we
[33:00] experienced the first snowfall
[33:03] &gt;&gt; in Canada. So we have a advanced snow
[33:08] white Christmas they call that.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; So I really appreciate all your prayer
[33:13] for remembering us and also for the
[33:17] appreciations gift that you've given us.
[33:19] So I receive cards and gifts and all of
[33:22] that. So I cannot mention names because
[33:24] if I mention one name and forget
[33:26] somebody maybe somebody will get you
[33:29] know some loving reaction. So, so I just
[33:34] want to thank you and appreciate each
[33:35] and everyone for remembering us. Amen.
[33:39] So, we'll just go directly to the word
[33:41] of God and I believe that we are in
[33:44] great expectations tonight.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:49] Although we can uh feel the the weather
[33:52] is about changing, it's getting cold,
[33:56] but I believe that the pillar of fire is
[33:58] here.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Make us Amen. make us warm. Amen.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Because we always he promised that he
[34:06] will be in our midst tonight.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; So, we'll just go directly to the word
[34:11] of God. Uh turn with me in the book of
[34:14] Genesis, a very familiar scripture. So
[34:18] I'm not bringing any new uh
[34:21] understanding, new revelation but just
[34:24] putting in reme in remembrance the
[34:26] things that we have already learned
[34:29] &gt;&gt; to gives us encouragement. Amen. Genesis
[34:33] chapter 3 verse
[34:36] 6
[34:42] it says and when the woman saw that the
[34:44] tree was good for food and it was
[34:48] pleasant to the eye so we will notice
[34:51] that pleasant to the eye so it's a
[34:55] strong visual factor connected to Eve
[34:58] being deceived so one of the biggest
[35:01] areas of personal Deception is when
[35:03] something look pleasant to the eye
[35:06] but underneath is a poison. Because
[35:08] mostly things that look pleasant to the
[35:10] eye, we're talking about worldly things.
[35:13] Yes, sir.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Are hiding death and poison and sorrows
[35:17] beneath it.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; The surface.
[35:20] So, and a tree to be desired to make one
[35:23] wise. So, she took one of the fruit
[35:26] thereof and did eat it and gave also
[35:29] unto her husband with her. and he did
[35:32] it. Now she is spreading her newfound
[35:36] knowledge of deception.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; This is the pattern of how deception and
[35:41] death spread like virus from one person
[35:44] to another.
[35:46] Uh another scripture in Matthew chap
[35:49] 24:4
[35:52] they're very familiar scripture. And
[35:55] there shall arise false Christ and false
[35:59] prophets,
[36:01] and shall great signs and wonders in so
[36:05] much that if it were possible, they
[36:10] shall deceive the very elected.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; But we have the message of the hour and
[36:17] understand and know that it is very
[36:22] impossible for the elect to be deceived.
[36:24] Thank you, Lord.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Because the elect is part of the word.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us bow our head.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we just
[36:32] &gt;&gt; appreciate your presence tonight, Lord
[36:34] God. And we
[36:37] just been so blessed to be in the house
[36:39] of the Lord [clears throat] and you
[36:41] promise wherever two or three are
[36:43] gathered in your name, you will be in
[36:44] our midst, Lord God. So, we are just
[36:46] privileged, Lord, that you give us
[36:48] strength to gather together and
[36:50] appreciate your goodness, Lord.
[36:52] appreciate your revelation. Appreciate
[36:54] your word of letting us letting us know
[36:57] who we are, Lord, and putting us in our
[36:59] position, oh God, to claim all the
[37:02] benefits that you have done for us,
[37:03] Lord. Once again, we invite your
[37:05] presence to be with us, Lord, and break
[37:07] the bread of life among us, Lord, to
[37:10] encourage us, Lord, to lift our faith a
[37:13] little bit higher, Lord God.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; So, we commit the service to you in the
[37:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and
[37:19] amen.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So you can be seated for a
[37:23] while. So
[37:26] I saw brother David and sister Anita
[37:28] Mayor. God bless you. Good to see you.
[37:31] Praise God. So I would like to title
[37:34] this uh little thought that God put in
[37:37] my heart deception in the evening time.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; So evening time is also called the
[37:44] harvest time. And the harvest time is
[37:46] also we know is the end time. So the
[37:51] deception at the evening time is on a
[37:54] personal level.
[37:57] So
[37:58] there are many forms of deceptions and
[38:01] many level of deception. So a nation can
[38:04] deceive a nation and a businessman can
[38:07] deceive a bellow of businessmen.
[38:09] And then there is when a person is
[38:11] deceived on a personal level and that is
[38:14] by far the most common area of deception
[38:17] today. Personal deception.
[38:22] So definition for deception is described
[38:26] as the act of making someone believe
[38:30] something that is not true.
[38:34] So deception takes place at a belief
[38:38] level.
[38:39] What you believe which is at your soul
[38:42] level. So deception at a personal level
[38:46] is a reality really a spiritual
[38:49] condition
[38:52] because there are many words that are
[38:54] also used in associations with this word
[38:56] deception
[38:58] success fraud, cheating, trickery,
[39:02] scamming, slightness, deceitfulness,
[39:04] fraud and so forth and so on. But the
[39:08] author is only one and that is the
[39:10] devil.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] And we have all
[39:16] and we have all had experience in some
[39:19] level in our journey in this life. May
[39:23] it be in business, in school or
[39:26] something or friend.
[39:29] Amen. So, and the reason that this
[39:32] happened to us is that we mostly don't
[39:35] actually know or have all the truth
[39:38] about what we are making our decision
[39:40] about.
[39:42] We just see something or advertising and
[39:46] make a decision based on what someone
[39:50] else had presented to us from the angle
[39:52] and it looked on the surface to be a
[39:54] good good thing. Even brother Brham
[39:58] experienced this in his ministry when he
[40:01] was in LA when he preached about the
[40:03] message oneness. So maybe he was he said
[40:07] that he was in a room with the
[40:09] television in it. So maybe he was
[40:11] invited and have a hotel and that hotel
[40:14] room there was a television and there
[40:16] was something that like the weather
[40:18] condition and he he put on the
[40:21] television to see what is the weather
[40:23] condition and while he was looking it
[40:26] there was an advertisement he said. So
[40:30] he said that I turn on the news and when
[40:31] I was hearing the news then I noticed
[40:33] that in the middle of the newscast they
[40:36] broke up to advertise some kind of a
[40:38] good some kind of detergent.
[40:41] And he said you don't have to wash your
[40:43] dieses anymore lady. The only thing you
[40:45] do is stick it right down in the water
[40:48] and let it there a couple of minutes
[40:50] raise it up and put it on the drain
[40:53] board. It's all over.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; What a great advers. He was so excited.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Wow. He said, "Wow." And he said, "I
[41:00] thought I'm going to be a hero when I
[41:02] get home."
[41:04] So he put the name of that put the name
[41:07] of a certain uh detergent and he said,
[41:11] "I tell my wife, look what I can do." So
[41:13] I went and got a bottle of this suckle
[41:16] strap and I squirted it for her. So I
[41:18] got the children's plate and rake out
[41:20] the crumb and so forth and the eggs
[41:22] sticking on it, drop it down the water
[41:24] and let it set a few minutes. So he was
[41:27] excited.
[41:32] what he saw. I'm sure
[41:35] &gt;&gt; this will happen
[41:37] &gt;&gt; and it drop it down the water and let it
[41:40] set for a few minutes and pick them out
[41:42] and set them on there. There's just as
[41:44] much egg on them as there was when I put
[41:46] it there. [laughter] Amen.
[41:50] He said I have lost my wife would lost
[41:53] confidence in me by that time.
[41:57] Amen. So out of his heart he said, "You
[42:01] see, why does the nation why does this
[42:03] nation let the people be deceived?"
[42:06] &gt;&gt; I said that ought to be allowed to be
[42:08] said like that that ought to be against
[42:11] the law. [laughter]
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. There must be something brother.
[42:17] Amen. So you see, why does the nation
[42:19] why does this nation let the people be
[42:21] deceived?
[42:23] &gt;&gt; That ought to be allowed to be said like
[42:25] that. at ought to be against the law. So
[42:28] we are easily deceived
[42:30] only have part of the truth
[42:33] &gt;&gt; that's right
[42:34] &gt;&gt; about something because when the whole
[42:36] truth is revealed then that is what
[42:38] actually uncover the deception
[42:41] &gt;&gt; and we know that God's word is the whole
[42:44] truth and so that is why we if we ever
[42:48] make a decision that is opposing to the
[42:50] word of God and we automatically
[42:53] automatically if we oppose the word of
[42:56] God automatically we become come
[42:59] you know
[43:00] we become in the state of deception.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Because we are trusting in our own
[43:07] limited understanding and reasoning
[43:09] instead of the eternal truth of God.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the message looking at the
[43:16] unseen when he preached in LA said when
[43:21] God made men he made him thus for he
[43:24] made this little certain compartment in
[43:27] the man for his own throne
[43:32] his control tower. God wants to lead men
[43:34] but man wants to lead himself. Therefore
[43:36] there is a war constantly the man wants
[43:38] to go after what he see with his eye.
[43:42] That's where he's deceived.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; That's where Satan deceived Eve by what
[43:46] she could see. And the fruit was
[43:49] pleasant to the eye, but it was death to
[43:51] the soul.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so in this day and age that we
[43:54] find ourselves living in such visually
[43:57] influenced world
[43:59] &gt;&gt; and so Satan has taken advantage of this
[44:01] and use the medium of televisions of the
[44:04] internet of the way word all all the
[44:07] kind of social media
[44:10] &gt;&gt; as a tool to deceive the people of the
[44:12] world in this age has he did in the
[44:14] beginning with Eve. Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Even when you go to the airport,
[44:19] everybody is on their cell phone, maybe
[44:21] looking movies or something or social
[44:23] media, everything.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so as a result of this,
[44:27] we find ourselves living in the greatest
[44:30] time of darkness. And we know that
[44:32] darkness in the Bible means spiritual
[44:34] ignorance where people are being taken
[44:37] in by scam of all various kind of
[44:40] personal deception because they are
[44:43] actually
[44:44] walking in great darkness of Laudishian
[44:47] age and they don't know that they are
[44:50] they are blinded to the fact
[44:52] &gt;&gt; a lot of ignorance because they never
[44:56] see the truth of the message of the
[44:58] hour.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there is so much information
[45:01] out there that it is almost impossible
[45:03] to know what is true.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; And what is only part true
[45:12] &gt;&gt; and which is part true and which is part
[45:14] lie and then what is a total lie because
[45:18] in our generations praise God the wrong
[45:22] will become right and the right become
[45:24] wrong.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] So in the in in uh our opening scripture
[45:30] in Genesis says, "And when the woman saw
[45:32] that the tree was good for food and that
[45:33] it was pleasant to the eye, and the tree
[45:35] to be desired to make wise, we see that
[45:38] a woman was deceived through the medium
[45:41] of her visual world
[45:44] that look attractive to her eyes. And if
[45:46] that was what we saw in Genesis in seed
[45:49] form, it will multiply in revelation in
[45:53] the harvest
[45:55] &gt;&gt; time.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; It reveal again in revelation harvest
[46:00] time in a multiple form. So Revelation
[46:03] chapter 13 11
[46:07] it says, "And I beheld another beast
[46:09] coming out of the earth." So it's not
[46:13] coming out of the sea, coming out of the
[46:15] earth. So as the prophet said, it was
[46:18] America
[46:19] &gt;&gt; and he had two horns like a lamb and
[46:21] brother Brennham said that it is an an
[46:23] American buffalo and he spake as a
[46:26] dragon. So America isn't the dragon.
[46:30] Rome is the dragon, the beast. But
[46:33] America is going to speak as the dragon
[46:36] because the Roman church and the state
[46:39] of America will unite together.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Rome is the religious power. America has
[46:47] the military power to enforce the will
[46:50] of the Roman church.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Verse 12.
[46:55] And he exercises all the power of the
[46:58] first beast because before him and
[47:01] causeth the earth and them which dwell
[47:04] therein to worship the first beast whose
[47:06] deadly womb was healed. So the prophet
[47:10] explained it in the message mark of the
[47:12] beast and we know a lot of scripture
[47:14] brother brotherly uh teach about the the
[47:18] mark of the beast. Amen. Revelation 13.
[47:22] This beast who was before America whose
[47:24] deadly wound was healed was the Roman
[47:26] Catholic Church. The nation of Rome,
[47:29] pagan Rome, fell and was delivered a
[47:32] blow unto death. But the spirit of the
[47:34] Roman nation came back to life again in
[47:38] the papal religious spirit of the Roman
[47:40] Catholic Church with all the pagan ways
[47:43] of the old Roman nation now living on in
[47:46] Roman Catholic Church. Verse 13. And he
[47:50] doeth great wonders, so that he maketh
[47:52] fire come from down from heaven and on
[47:55] the earth in the sight of men. As the
[47:57] prophet said, it was atomic bomb in
[47:59] Jerusima, Herusima and Nagazaki. As the
[48:03] prophet said, it was atomic bomb,
[48:05] hydrogen bomb. And this is a fire that
[48:08] has come out that come about because of
[48:10] the opening of the bottomless pit in
[48:13] Revelation chapter 9. The key that
[48:16] opened up the pit of hell was the key of
[48:19] science and technology.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; The fourth dimension.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Great wonders are achieved in this end
[48:26] time age because of science and
[48:28] technology.
[48:30] That is what is causing people to be
[48:32] blinded to the truth. So they are so wow
[48:36] out by the wonders of technology that
[48:39] they have become deceived by it.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Especially all the inventions, all
[48:44] the rocket science, all the technology,
[48:47] all the AI.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; It makes our life easier. But the more
[48:53] we we we we accept the modern
[48:56] technology, the more we become
[49:01] uh not sensitive to Holy Spirit of God.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Remember that the prayer of the saints
[49:06] is more powerful, a million times
[49:09] stronger than angels. Society
[49:12] is trying to take away our prayer life
[49:16] &gt;&gt; by the technology, by the amusement, by
[49:19] our cell phone, by whatever social media
[49:22] that we are in. Almost all our time is
[49:26] consumed by the technology.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Remember that we need to pray.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Without ceasing
[49:34] &gt;&gt; because your prayer is a million times
[49:37] stronger than angel. Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; So you need to pray.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; We can see all the calamities all around
[49:44] us. Storm there, storm here, earthquake
[49:46] there. Who is who will be the one to
[49:49] stand in the gap
[49:51] &gt;&gt; when that happen? Because we become
[49:54] praise God the a coworker with God. We
[49:57] will stand in the gap.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Who will pray for them?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; It is now our responsibility.
[50:06] As the prophet said, your prayer is much
[50:09] stronger.
[50:11] But Satan knows about it. So that's why
[50:14] he bombarded us with all this
[50:16] technology. Praise God. All this
[50:19] happening, looking at the our our media
[50:23] through sport or something like that.
[50:25] And sometimes we forgot to pray.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; We only pray when we eat.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you. Even when we pray, just
[50:34] thank you, Lord. May you sanctify it.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Which is okay.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Instead of praying for your fruit from
[50:42] Genesis to Revelation.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; But we need to pray.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; When we wake up, we need to pray. We
[50:49] pray for somebody. Not don't pray for
[50:51] just yourself.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Pray for somebody those who are in need.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Dispute is empty. Maybe somebody is is
[50:59] is in something in trouble or trial that
[51:03] they cannot make it tonight.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; So thinking negative about that.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; You need to think positively.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Lord help them brother. If they are not
[51:15] here Lord maybe they are something in
[51:17] trouble or trial in their life they are
[51:19] undergoing IN THEIR LIFE. LORD
[51:21] HALLELUJAH. BY YOUR GRACE AND YOUR MERCY
[51:23] Lord being a mouthpiece OF THIS GOD
[51:25] BEING LORD I AM I STAND IN THE GAP
[51:28] between them Lord.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is our duty right now my
[51:32] brother and sisters. So let us pray more
[51:34] and more and more.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you you you don't want to
[51:38] hear oh prayer pray. Oh I pray I pray
[51:41] &gt;&gt; but we need prayer not for ourselves.
[51:43] Prayer for somebody. Yes.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; When God put something in your heart,
[51:47] let you remember your memory. Something
[51:49] a brother you thought of somebody your
[51:51] brother. Praise God. It was God inspired
[51:53] you to pray for that brother.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Good preaching. Good preaching.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Don't always pray for yourself. Lord, I
[52:02] lost my job. I lost this. I lost that. I
[52:04] lost that. I lost my business. No, don't
[52:06] think about that. God knows about it
[52:08] all.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. Just he said that seek ye
[52:11] first the kingdom of God and all these
[52:13] things that will be added unto you. What
[52:15] we need to think about is our people in
[52:17] the last days. We are looking for the
[52:19] last day and we are in great expectation
[52:21] praise God for the coming of the Lord.
[52:23] And we we are expecting something for
[52:25] the coming of the Lord. That
[52:27] expectations must influence our thinking
[52:29] and our life and our action. Amen. Amen.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Because if we are looking for the coming
[52:33] of the Lord, our action need something
[52:36] to reflect that expectation.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; You need to pray
[52:41] &gt;&gt; because not everybody can go when some
[52:44] when only one is left behind.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; So we need to claim everybody.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; We need to claim. Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Now
[52:54] verse 14. And they deceived them that
[52:56] dwell on the earth by means of those
[52:59] miracles
[53:00] which he had power to do in the sight of
[53:02] the beast, saying to them that dwell on
[53:05] the earth that they should make an image
[53:08] to the beast which had a wound by a
[53:10] sword and did live. Notice should make
[53:14] an image to the beast.
[53:18] An image is something that you see with
[53:20] your eye. In other words, sight and
[53:23] deception are again associated together
[53:26] at the end time when not just one woman
[53:30] was deceived on a personal level but the
[53:33] entire world would be drawn into
[53:36] deception.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; That is why Hollywood has been
[53:40] successful in influencing the entire
[53:43] world by the visual aid of television.
[53:49] Eve was deceived by the influence and
[53:51] the deception of what she saw.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Tell vision.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; By what the serpent told her and by what
[54:02] she saw with her eye.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 15. And he had power to give
[54:09] life unto the image of the beast that
[54:12] the image of the beast should not speak
[54:16] should both speak and cause that as many
[54:19] as would not worship the image of the
[54:22] beast should be killed.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Although this prophecy not pertains to
[54:27] the elect
[54:30] pertains to the whole world.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:34] and cause that as many as would not
[54:37] worship the image of the beast should be
[54:40] killed. So when the church and state
[54:42] unite together again in this end time
[54:44] age, then we will see the same thing
[54:46] that we saw in the dark ages where they
[54:49] will put everything to death that
[54:51] doesn't agree with them.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; So we need wisdom,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; we need revelation, we need
[54:59] understanding in these last days. Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; We need revelation more than anything
[55:04] else.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, "Upon this rock, I
[55:08] will build my church." So, we need
[55:09] wisdom. We need revelation. We need
[55:11] understanding in these last days.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; King Solomon in his Proverbs chapter 16
[55:18] verse 16. How much better
[55:22] it is to get wisdom than gold and to get
[55:25] understanding rather to be chosen than
[55:29] silver. It's good to have silver and
[55:32] gold, but wisdom is better because you
[55:35] can lose all your money. But when wisdom
[55:38] is given to you by God, then that is the
[55:40] very source of your wealth.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Job lost all of his silvers and gold and
[55:46] everything.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; But he never lose his wisdom. And in the
[55:52] end, he became twice wealthy as he is
[55:57] &gt;&gt; because God restored
[56:00] double time.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; That's why if you are in a trial right
[56:04] now, it seems some things is is lost.
[56:07] Everything is lost. We have a pattern.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Just continue believing on the Lord
[56:14] Jesus Christ.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Just continue serving the Lord in the
[56:17] good time and in the bad time because at
[56:19] the end,
[56:21] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, it will multiply and he will
[56:23] double it
[56:24] &gt;&gt; if you continue on.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just don't lose wisdom and
[56:29] understanding in the word of God. Seek
[56:31] ye first the kingdom of God.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; And 17, the highway of the upright is to
[56:40] depart from evil.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; He that giveth his way preserveth his
[56:44] souls. Praise God. Pride goeth before
[56:46] destruction and a hotty spirit before a
[56:50] fault.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; So hoty spirit, attitude of arrogance
[56:54] and pride.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what has become in this
[56:58] eight a holoty spirit that the Hollywood
[57:00] has produced in the masses by deception
[57:03] of television.
[57:05] Holty arrogance. Revelation chapter 3. I
[57:10] don't need I don't need anything. I am
[57:12] rich.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the scriptures that you
[57:16] are miserable, rich, naked, and you
[57:19] don't know it.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Verse 19. Better it is to be of a humble
[57:25] spirit with the lowly than to divide a
[57:28] spoil with a pearl.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; He that handle a matter wisely shall
[57:34] find good. And whoso trusteth in the
[57:36] Lord, happy is he.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; So when the wisdom of God and humility
[57:42] come together in a person, then that is
[57:45] what is reflecting God.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:48] Because God because these two qualities
[57:50] are part of God's two great
[57:53] characteristic
[57:55] &gt;&gt; humbleness. Praise God.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Wisdom and humility.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:03] So wisdom is so important. Even the
[58:06] queen of the south, praise God, travel
[58:09] in order to seek the wisdom of Solomon.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; And greater than Solomon is here. Amen.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is greater than Solomon.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So when ignorance of the
[58:21] word of God and pride join together that
[58:24] then that person or church or nation
[58:26] depending on whatever level this is on
[58:29] is doomed for destruction.
[58:32] So this is exactly what happened to King
[58:34] Nebuchadnezzar
[58:36] when he was lifted up with the pride of
[58:38] his own ability and loses mana and he
[58:41] became insane.
[58:43] a type of disad going into total
[58:46] insanity because the pride and arrogance
[58:48] against God.
[58:50] So in Genesis we find that one woman was
[58:54] deceived on a personal level. In
[58:57] Revelation we find that all the people
[58:59] of the word that are outside of the
[59:01] knowledge of the revealed word of this
[59:04] hour are also being deceived. Each one
[59:08] &gt;&gt; on a personal level.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the message a deceived church
[59:13] by the word when brother Brennham
[59:15] preached in June of 1959.
[59:19] Brother Bham takes the the the
[59:23] uh took it took the text from Judges
[59:27] chapter 16 speaking about Samson
[59:31] and we know the story of Samson being
[59:33] deceived by Delilah which represent the
[59:36] false church of this hour. We find that
[59:39] Delilah had combined with the state
[59:41] military might that was backing her just
[59:43] like we see prophecy 13 where the church
[59:46] and the state Romans and Romans and
[59:48] America will unite together in this hour
[59:52] to bring deception upon those whose name
[59:54] are not written on the lamb's book of
[59:56] life.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Those whose name are not written in the
[1:00:00] lamb's book of life will be deceived.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the elect of God will not be
[1:00:05] deceived because full truth has been
[1:00:07] revealed to her.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if a false church is deceived
[1:00:12] by the world,
[1:00:14] then the true church must be enlightened
[1:00:18] by the word.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So at the opening and the
[1:00:21] revealing of the word to the bride in
[1:00:23] this hour is the only thing that will
[1:00:26] withstand the deception in this hour.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The opening of the word, the
[1:00:32] revealing of the word, hallelujah, is
[1:00:36] the only thing that will withstand the
[1:00:38] deception of this hour. No other truth
[1:00:41] or secret knowledge or conspiracy theory
[1:00:45] will do it. Only the revelation of the
[1:00:47] opening of the full word in this hour
[1:00:50] will be able to stand against the
[1:00:52] deception of this hour. We become an
[1:00:55] invisible army,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; a super race. Amen. Hallelujah. So look
[1:01:00] at Daniel.
[1:01:05] In Daniel's time, the state changed the
[1:01:08] law relating to his religious belief.
[1:01:12] Amen.
[1:01:14] And in one day, Daniel was made a
[1:01:16] criminal.
[1:01:18] He was thrown into the lion's den.
[1:01:21] Praise God.
[1:01:23] But remember when they throw Daniel into
[1:01:27] a lion's den, that was also the time
[1:01:30] when the lion came into a condition of
[1:01:33] what they were before the fall of men.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; This is like Adam and Eden again.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; And that is promised in this age because
[1:01:43] the angel has brought us back to us the
[1:01:46] title deed of redemption.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. of the ownership of the
[1:01:50] earth by the opening of the seventh
[1:01:52] seal. So the condition is returning back
[1:01:55] to the condition of Eden.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; The animal under the prophet Noah's
[1:02:01] ministry came into an edenic condition
[1:02:03] and were at peace with one another
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; while under the influence of Noah's
[1:02:09] ministry.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're not quarreling. They
[1:02:14] are at peace with one another
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; because God is restoring. Hallelujah.
[1:02:19] The original
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; condition in Eden
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; during that time like the killer bull
[1:02:26] that would have killed brother Bernham
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; but it hadn't been for that divine love
[1:02:31] that God gave to him right then. It was
[1:02:33] the love of God. It was the Eden
[1:02:35] condition during the time.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because brother Brham at the
[1:02:40] rising of the sun he was the first sheep
[1:02:41] to be waved. It was God now came down in
[1:02:45] this deadic condition
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; and we need to recognize that condition.
[1:02:49] Praise God. Because we are already uh
[1:02:52] covered up by this word that we forgot
[1:02:55] that we are now in the hidden condition
[1:02:57] because the ownership of the title deed
[1:02:59] of ownership is being restored to each
[1:03:01] one of us.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us not always limit the
[1:03:06] benefit that God gave us in these last
[1:03:08] days. We need to exercise it. Amen. If
[1:03:11] something happen, we need to speak the
[1:03:13] word.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If there is a storm, speak
[1:03:16] the word.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; The storm in your life, the trial, YOU
[1:03:19] SPEAK THE WORD.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; I AM THE SON of God. Hallelujah.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't claim those trials.
[1:03:26] I am not doom. I am not something.
[1:03:28] Praise God. But I am a son of God.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; God died for me because God wants to
[1:03:34] express himself in me.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't want TO BE A
[1:03:38] FLOWER BASE. HE WANTS ME TO EXPRESS
[1:03:40] HIMSELF in it.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Because we are living under our
[1:03:46] benefits.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; It is now now to we need to stand. We
[1:03:50] need to recognize that we are sons and
[1:03:52] daughters of God.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT BOUND BY TIME but we ARE
[1:03:55] BOUND INTO ETERNITY. WE need to express
[1:03:58] somebody. We need to express the love of
[1:04:00] God in our heart.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Let us not talk about trials and
[1:04:05] testing. Oh, I am this. I am that. Oh, I
[1:04:08] am sorry. I am No. SPEAK ABOUT THE
[1:04:10] PROMISES OF GOD. HE DIED FOR ME SO THAT
[1:04:14] HE WILL RESTORE. I CAN SPEAK SOMETHING
[1:04:17] INTO EXISTING BY GOD'S GRACE.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You need to pray. You need to speak. You
[1:04:24] need to recognize your name.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The failure of the entire world
[1:04:31] and the entire human race of mankind,
[1:04:33] the animal kingdom, the boat in the life
[1:04:36] and all the sea life was when one
[1:04:38] individual woman was deceived
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; on a personal level.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1,
[1:04:47] Genesis 3, one woman personally deceived
[1:04:50] in her belief.
[1:04:53] Revelation. Now the whole world is
[1:04:55] deceived by each individual person of
[1:04:58] the world being deceived personally in
[1:05:00] their belief because deception has to do
[1:05:03] with your belief.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; But the bride of Christ in this hour is
[1:05:07] promised that she would not be deceived.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; She would not deceive because why?
[1:05:13] Because he was part OF THE WORD.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. A part of the word that she
[1:05:18] is part of the word. is the word and it
[1:05:20] is impossible to deceive the word
[1:05:22] itself.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet in these last
[1:05:25] days that let us know who we are. WE ARE
[1:05:28] PART OF THE WORD OF GOD IN THIS last
[1:05:30] days. If we are THE PART OF THE WORD
[1:05:32] THEN WE NEED TO EXPRESS THE WORD IN our
[1:05:34] life.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Let us not walk just like the
[1:05:39] denomination do this and do that do this
[1:05:42] and do that. Let us be led by the spirit
[1:05:44] of the Lord. Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Lord let thy will be done on my heart.
[1:05:48] Lord
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; in the message Messiah
[1:05:55] he preached in Shri report. He said he
[1:05:58] talk about Billy Graham. Billy Graham
[1:06:00] quoted Matthew chapter 24:24.
[1:06:03] Praise God that the elect
[1:06:07] if possible will be deceived. And Billy
[1:06:10] Graham say that the other in the message
[1:06:12] he said the elected is already deceived.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; No. No. As brother. The elected ain't
[1:06:21] going to be deceived. No. No. They won't
[1:06:25] be.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; No. The church member will
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; but not the elect. IF YOU ARE JUST A
[1:06:32] CHURCH MEMBER, HALLELUJAH. YOU WILL BE
[1:06:34] DECEIVED.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE A CHURCH MEMBER. ONLY RECOGNIZE
[1:06:39] THAT YOU ARE IN LACK OF GOD. IT IS NOT
[1:06:41] DAY THAT YOU ARE PART OF THE WORD SIR.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DON'T BE A CHURCH MEMBER.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Go to CHURCH BY YOUR TITHE. DON'T BE
[1:06:48] LIKE THAT. BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:06:50] BE AN ELECTED.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; STAND ON YOUR TWO.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And claim your promises.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT BE DECEIVED.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU ARE ELECTED, PRAISE GOD.
[1:07:02] EVEN though you want to go around, you
[1:07:03] don't
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; you can never be deceived.
[1:07:07] The prophet said, "No, no, no.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; The elected ain't going to be deceived."
[1:07:13] No, no, no, no. They won't.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Tell Satan, "No, no, no, no, no."
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Tell Satan, "No, no, no, no.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, you do this, you do that, do you do
[1:07:24] this, you are not son of God." Tell
[1:07:26] Satan, "No, no, no, no, no."
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; I AM A SEED OF ABRAHAM.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; AND GOD, DON'T LOOK AT MY SHORTCOMINGS.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; God looked our heart because we believe
[1:07:39] the word and it was imputed FOR US FOR
[1:07:41] HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS BY BELIEVING THE WORD.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Tell Satan, "No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; But you commit this, but you commit
[1:07:55] that." No, no, no, no, no.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; I'M BEING WASHED BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:08:00] CHRIST.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. when okay
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; church member will be but not the
[1:08:12] elected they was chosen
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; yeah that's right
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; from the foundation of the WORD
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE CHOSEN ABOVE ALL THE MILLIONS
[1:08:20] OF THE WORLD YOU WERE CHOSEN YOU WERE
[1:08:23] ELECTED YOU ARE SELECTED TO STAND AND
[1:08:26] MAGNIFY GOD IN this loudest year and age
[1:08:30] WHERE THERE'S TOTAL DARKNESS, THERE IS
[1:08:32] STILL LIGHT SHINING AMONG US. [cheering]
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Sons of God are the light of his word.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise God.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; They cannot be deceived.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They cannot be deceived.
[1:08:48] It's impossible.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; They will not be deceived.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; So that's why whatever you do, whatever
[1:08:56] things in your life, you never be in
[1:08:58] this place without the grace of God.
[1:09:01] Because not everybody received the
[1:09:03] message but you here even Wednesday
[1:09:06] night you hear the worship God.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Have you wondered why?
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Because you are part of God.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And you cannot help yourself to come.
[1:09:16] THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID if you are a
[1:09:18] Christian it not your desire to be a
[1:09:20] Christian. It is God's desire for you to
[1:09:23] be a Christian because no one can come
[1:09:25] to him except the father draws him
[1:09:27] there.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; So we ARE HERE BY GOD'S GRACE. WE ARE
[1:09:30] THE MANIFESTATIONS. PRAISE GOD. Of his
[1:09:32] word
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; that wherever two or three gather in his
[1:09:36] name, he will be in our midst.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah. And he is speaking for us
[1:09:39] tonight.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5. So the Bible said
[1:09:48] that false Christ would rise in the last
[1:09:51] days and would deceive the very elected
[1:09:54] if it was possible.
[1:09:58] But it's not possible.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; How many time did we tell Satan it's not
[1:10:04] possible?
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH HOW MUCH YOU TELL ME
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; that I am not an elected. It is
[1:10:11] impossible.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY SENT. HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:16] I DIDN'T FIND GOD. I DIDN'T SEEK TO FIND
[1:10:18] GOD. BUT GOD SEEK TO FIND ME.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; I AM HIS SON. HALLELUJAH. AND HE LET me
[1:10:24] know that I am his son before the
[1:10:26] foundation of the word.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; It was just like
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[1:10:35] when they went to
[1:10:38] Aimilec.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; He tells Sarah, "Tell the king that you
[1:10:47] are my sister
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; or else if they know they will kill me."
[1:10:52] But then when the king so excited,
[1:10:57] praise God, he said, "Okay,
[1:11:00] I have a beautiful bride tomorrow.
[1:11:04] Spotless, beautiful, flawless with
[1:11:08] beautiful blue eyes. She will be my
[1:11:10] wife."
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; But God, Hallelujah. Show him in the
[1:11:14] dream.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Return
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; my prophet's wife.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:21] If you will not return, I will kill you.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bypass Abraham's
[1:11:27] shortcoming
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; because he already believed the promised
[1:11:31] word and it was imputed for him for his
[1:11:33] righteousness.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't decide TO COMMIT SIN. BUT GOD
[1:11:37] bypass all of that.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RETURN MY PROPHET. HE
[1:11:41] IDENTIFY RETURN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Return
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; my sons and daughters.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Help.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; If you are suffering, you need to say,
[1:11:56] "Satan,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; come out."
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Okay, I will not go.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; I will not go that way.
[1:12:07] Amen.
[1:12:10] See, the Bible said that the false
[1:12:12] Christ would rise in the last days. Have
[1:12:14] we seen false Christ?
[1:12:16] Hallelujah. A lot of them is coming
[1:12:18] around.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Would deceive the very elected if it was
[1:12:21] possible. That's why I love the
[1:12:23] scripture. If it was possible.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; But it's not possible. No sir. The
[1:12:29] elected was ordained so they will not be
[1:12:31] deceived. You see what is the secret of
[1:12:33] this. Notice how that in Eden that Adam
[1:12:36] wasn't with Eve when she was dealing
[1:12:39] with the serpent. Right?
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; As brother Bernham said, she cannot
[1:12:44] wait.
[1:12:47] But in the end time, the bride and the
[1:12:49] groom are already united together in
[1:12:52] marriage.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; And his mind is already in her. And the
[1:12:56] two have become one by the revelation of
[1:12:59] this word.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Eve was deceived because she cannot wait
[1:13:02] for her headship. But in these last
[1:13:05] days, praise God, the headship has come.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Our headship is the word. Our headship
[1:13:10] is Christ and our protection AGAINST
[1:13:12] DECEPTION IS OUR head which is Jesus
[1:13:14] Christ.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 8, Ephesians church
[1:13:21] age 8. But we have discovered that the
[1:13:25] word also teaches an invasion of error
[1:13:29] until there is a complete blackout of
[1:13:31] truth in the last days when the Lord is
[1:13:34] about to appear.
[1:13:37] The question now arises in our mind does
[1:13:40] God forsake his own and let them fall
[1:13:44] into a state of complete deception.
[1:13:48] On no account the scripture says that
[1:13:50] very clearly in Matthew 24 that the
[1:13:52] elect cannot be deceived.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; We cannot argue about that.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; It was already being declared.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; The elect cannot be deceived. Amen.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; So whatever situation you are in just go
[1:14:07] back to the word of God. If you are
[1:14:08] elect you need to claim it
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; that you cannot be deceived.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; That your name is written in the book of
[1:14:16] life.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] So Eve's protection against deception
[1:14:24] was her headship which was Adam.
[1:14:27] She did not have the capacity within
[1:14:30] herself. So the first little trick that
[1:14:32] was played on her
[1:14:34] She got hooked.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Had she stayed behind her headship Adam
[1:14:40] instead of trying to reason things
[1:14:42] herself then the fall in Eden could
[1:14:44] never have taken place.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; But we understand that everything that
[1:14:48] comes that happens in order it is God's
[1:14:53] uh purpose to be
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; express to express his attributes.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; So why will this last Eve not be
[1:15:01] deceived?
[1:15:05] Not because God has changed the makeup
[1:15:07] of the woman given her own ability to
[1:15:09] defend herself and withstand deception,
[1:15:11] but because she has come into her
[1:15:12] correct possession.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Correct position of her
[1:15:16] headship in this hour under Christ the
[1:15:18] word. She has forsaken her risen and has
[1:15:22] taken on the mind of Christ by the
[1:15:24] revelation of the word in this day. So
[1:15:27] our protection from deception is our
[1:15:29] headship which is Christ the revealed
[1:15:31] word in this hour. We need to be in our
[1:15:34] headship because if we are not under the
[1:15:36] headship of the word we will be
[1:15:38] deceived.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Notice in Genesis Eve did not involve
[1:15:45] Adam when dealing with the serpent.
[1:15:49] But in contrast this end time bride is
[1:15:52] not even talking to the serpent.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:58] She is staying directly behind her
[1:16:01] husband who by the opening of the
[1:16:03] seventh seal has unveiled himself to her
[1:16:07] and has pated her with the seed of the
[1:16:11] original spoken word seed.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are already predated by
[1:16:16] the spoken word sin. Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Part of what the seven sins reveal was
[1:16:21] to uncover the deception of how the
[1:16:24] antichrist has been deceiving the people
[1:16:27] since the time of Eve.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; By the white horse, by the red horse, by
[1:16:33] the black horse, by the pale horse. But
[1:16:36] since Satan's plan of deceit has now
[1:16:38] been uncovered in the bride, she now
[1:16:40] become an invisible army.
[1:16:44] Then his trick DON'T WORK ANYMORE
[1:16:45] BECAUSE THE truth has exposed him
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; and wrote him powerless
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; against the people of God.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; If the church know it condition and the
[1:16:56] move of God and the the antichrist and
[1:16:58] she knows who he was.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; You will become an invisible army in
[1:17:02] this.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:06] So the access the access to true freedom
[1:17:09] and protection is by the receiving the
[1:17:11] headship of the word.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; And remaining in that position.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Stay on your position.
[1:17:22] The only way to avoid becoming a part of
[1:17:25] the deception of this hour is to get
[1:17:28] into your position behind the word of
[1:17:30] God
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; that has been revealed through the
[1:17:33] vindicated prophet that God has sent for
[1:17:36] this day.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ isn't deceived
[1:17:41] church by the word.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; She is an enlightened church by the
[1:17:46] revelation of the word.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:50] So, I'm uh calling our musicians to
[1:17:52] come.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Serious.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; You want more?
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; I came, brother.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want when we are in
[1:18:06] the church.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; LET'S GO CHURCH. AMEN.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Let us go church. Let us not stand as a
[1:18:12] flower base
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; being tired and sleepy. Let us have
[1:18:16] church. So that's why I'm calling our
[1:18:18] musician to come. [laughter]
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; We need to save for Sunday
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; so that our excitement will not dry out.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; We need to be excited every day. Amen.
[1:18:32] We need to hear the word. We need to be
[1:18:34] excited.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Who will be the preacher by next Sunday?
[1:18:36] We need to pray. Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Because Hallelujah. Because let's keep
[1:18:40] the fire. Hallelujah. Let's keep on the
[1:18:43] fire.
[1:18:45] The bride of Christ isn't deceived by
[1:18:47] the words. He is an enlightened church
[1:18:49] by the revelations of the word.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Here is the secret. The word is in the
[1:18:55] bride.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the original seed.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Here is the secret. The word is in the
[1:19:03] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[1:19:06] what he wants done with a word.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; And she does it in his name. She has.
[1:19:11] Thus, said the Lord. Yes. Amen.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The mind of Christ was in
[1:19:15] you. SO WE HAVE THUS SAID THE LORD.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Loud young churches. In this last day,
[1:19:23] there is again another people
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; in the land who under the messenger will
[1:19:28] be the final voice to the final age.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; We become the final voice to the age.
[1:19:33] Because under our messenger, we become
[1:19:36] we did not BECOME A FINAL VOICE BY OUR
[1:19:38] own understanding. We become the final
[1:19:41] voice to arrange under our messenger.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Because we need to take the book.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; AND WE NEED TO PROPHESY AGAIN.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; So we become the final voice under our
[1:19:55] messenger.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Not a messenger. NO OTHER MESSENGER. WE
[1:20:01] HAVE THE MESSENGER, THE CHRIST, THE
[1:20:03] ANGEL of the covenant.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; HAS COME DOWN WITH AN OPEN BOOK. AMEN.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And he remained
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; here. Glory to God.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; In the last days, there is again another
[1:20:15] people in the land. Who is that another
[1:20:17] people? You and me.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; WE BECOME THE FINAL VOICE IN THE FINAL
[1:20:21] AGE UNDER OUR MESSENGER.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. The church is no longer the
[1:20:28] mouthpiece of God. It is its own
[1:20:31] mouthpiece.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Give out the mouthpiece of God.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; So God is turning on her. Yes.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. What a great responsibility.
[1:20:39] GOD IS TURNING on her, the church, the
[1:20:42] bride, the elected.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; What a privileged people we are.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; So don't belittle yourself.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Don't don't pity the party.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am this, I am that. No. Go back to
[1:20:58] the word.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; GO BACK TO WHAT THE WORD PROMISE ABOUT
[1:21:02] YOU. AMEN.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; GO BACK TO WHAT THE WORD REVEALED about
[1:21:06] you.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Just like Gideon, when the angel of the
[1:21:10] Lord goes to Gideon, I want you to
[1:21:12] deliver your people. He look at his
[1:21:14] shortcomings.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; I am the poorest of the poor. And maybe
[1:21:17] you mistaken me for somebody else.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; But the angel don't make mistakes.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; HE KNOW EXACTLY THE TIME, the season,
[1:21:27] the age that you will be living. So
[1:21:29] that's why he sent Elijah to you.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Not to them. To you
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; to you sir.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; And you need TO CLAIM THAT YOU THAT YOU
[1:21:37] ARE NOT YOU.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; I AM the you. I AM THE ELECTED. I AM THE
[1:21:42] CHOSEN.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to claim the promises.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Because the promises is about you.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't claim it even though
[1:21:56] you are still in the midst of so much
[1:21:58] trial.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's okay.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Trial and testing is just to express
[1:22:03] God's attribute in our life.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; THE MORE TRIAL, THE MORE ATTRIBUTE will
[1:22:08] express from our life.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE MORE TRIAL we become
[1:22:11] humble, we become hallelujah. We become
[1:22:15] humble in wisdom and humility.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; The mouthpiece of God it is. It's all
[1:22:22] mouthpiece. God is turning her. Not
[1:22:24] turning to others,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; turning to her.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Who is that her? You and me.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will confound her through
[1:22:33] the prophet and the bride. For the voice
[1:22:35] of God will be in her.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Just like Rahab when she received the
[1:22:42] spy
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; before the judgment of Jericho,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; she received the word.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; She keep the word and she was given a
[1:22:51] token.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. When the judgment strike, you need
[1:22:54] to display the token
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; and when receive the token will pass
[1:22:58] over you.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And during the TIME IN
[1:23:01] JERICHO, SHE WAS THE FINAL VOICE.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF SOMEBODY WANTS salvations
[1:23:07] in Jericho, they need to seek Rahab
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; because salvation is only IN RAHAB JUST
[1:23:14] LIKE WE ARE IN OUR DAY. THE WORD IS IN
[1:23:16] THE BRIDE.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF THEY WANT SALVATION, IF THEY
[1:23:19] WANT DELIVERANCE, IT IS IN the voice
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; of the bride in this last day,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; you need to feel it yourself.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DON'T LET SOMEBODY
[1:23:28] EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU FEEL. YOU NEED TO
[1:23:30] FEEL IT.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You make it personal.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; You need to rejoice.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; He will confound her through the prophet
[1:23:42] and the bride. For the voice of God will
[1:23:44] be in her.
[1:23:46] Yes, it is. For his saints, in the last
[1:23:48] days of Revelation 17, the spirit and
[1:23:51] the bride say, "Come."
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:23:56] [applause]
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; My
[1:24:10] Yeah.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "That's good stuff."
[1:24:14] That's good stuff.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm closing now. You got to be
[1:24:19] kidding me. That Eric, that was classic,
[1:24:22] man.
[1:24:25] What? You want more? Yeah. Come hungry,
[1:24:27] man. Don't be giving me just Don't give
[1:24:29] me a bone. GIVE ME A STEAK.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; KEEP PREACHING. AMEN. I love that. I
[1:24:34] love that. That was very, very good.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Deception at the end time. All kinds of
[1:24:41] forms of deception. He goes in and the
[1:24:43] physical eye and that sort of thing. And
[1:24:45] then he takes that first woman in the
[1:24:49] first Eden. There it was one woman and
[1:24:52] she was and watch this. While she was
[1:24:55] separated from Adam
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; because the brother Bram said Adam was
[1:25:00] her protection
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; but she was out alone.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Okay, this was after the separation. And
[1:25:08] when he found her alone, then he talked
[1:25:09] to her. And because she lusted for
[1:25:12] knowledge,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; and remember, thou shalt not eat of the
[1:25:16] tree of knowledge. Brother Bren said,
[1:25:19] watch those two trees. She lusted after
[1:25:22] the wrong thing. And the next thing you
[1:25:25] know, she was deceived.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, Brother Brennham says, "Now
[1:25:29] watch what God does. He does the same
[1:25:32] thing in Satan's Eden.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; He chooses one woman
[1:25:38] Right? But she's not separated. She's
[1:25:40] been united again.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; So she can't be deceived. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:25:45] THE CHRIST THAT is in her will not see.
[1:25:48] Her headship is the word. AND SO SHE
[1:25:51] CANNOT BE DECEIVED.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit AND THE BRIDE HAVE
[1:25:57] BEEN UNITED.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; NO LONGER SEPARATED. THERE'S been an
[1:26:02] invisible union.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Who have YOU BEEN UNITED TO? YOUR
[1:26:06] BRIDEGROOM.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH. BOY, I tell you what,
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; that's action-packed,
[1:26:15] sir.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; I love it. I love to get excited about
[1:26:18] the word of God.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; You see the types and shadows and
[1:26:22] everything. Listen, you don't have to be
[1:26:25] worried, [music] you know, I'm going to
[1:26:26] be deceived or something. No. Hey,
[1:26:29] listen. If you're elect, you cannot
[1:26:30] [music] be deceived.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, you might be sidetracked. Yeah,
[1:26:35] that's happened.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Huh? You might be sidetracked for it,
[1:26:39] but you know what he said? God is
[1:26:41] obligated to always bring you back. Keep
[1:26:44] the right attitude, the right spirit.
[1:26:46] I'd rather have the right spirit and the
[1:26:48] wrong doctrine.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because then God can correct me.
[1:26:53] We get this know-it-all spirit. And we,
[1:26:55] you know, I ah
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; that's proud and arrogant. When you have
[1:26:59] the word, Brother Brim said, when that
[1:27:01] harvest is ripened and she's ready to be
[1:27:05] harvested, how can you tell?
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; She bows her head.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; The more that I get closer to Christ,
[1:27:13] the more I bow my head and say, "It's
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; it's him.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; It's all about him. Let's stand
[1:27:19] together." My We've had church tonight.
[1:27:22] Somebody give God some praise tonight.

[1:28:05] word is quickened.

[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Wow. It's hard to follow that. Yeah,
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; you know, um I believe there is an
[1:35:14] awakening right now and
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; there's, you know, even the
[1:35:18] denominational churches, you know, I'm
[1:35:20] out there and I I see there's a lot of
[1:35:22] people that are coming to the Lord, you
[1:35:25] know, and they don't have the light that
[1:35:27] we have
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; and they're hungry and they're looking
[1:35:30] for truth. [snorts]
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible says there'll be a famine in
[1:35:33] the last day. Not so much for bread and
[1:35:35] water.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; But for the word of God and the true
[1:35:38] word. Amen.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Not the water down the translated. Thank
[1:35:41] you, Lord, that he sent us truth.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; But I was at my barber
[1:35:46] and I've been going there for a while.
[1:35:48] And you [snorts] know, I'm not one of
[1:35:51] those guys that gets all caught up in
[1:35:52] the news, but he said uh he said, "Can
[1:35:55] you believe that New York voted in a
[1:35:57] Muslim?" And I thought, you know, I did
[1:36:00] hear that. I said, "Isn't that something
[1:36:03] after 911 you'd have thought that would
[1:36:05] have never happened?" Yeah.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Right. But there's a lot of things that
[1:36:08] I've thought should have never happened
[1:36:10] that have happened. You know,
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; that's true.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, you know, of the three
[1:36:15] candidates that were going for office,
[1:36:18] he said one of them had served prior and
[1:36:21] he didn't he didn't do very well, so
[1:36:23] they weren't going to vote for that guy.
[1:36:26] And then they said the other guy was a
[1:36:27] crooked guy and, you know, they didn't
[1:36:29] want somebody crooked in office. And
[1:36:31] this guy, this Muslim guy was wasn't
[1:36:34] really a bad guy.
[1:36:37] But he says, you know, the the
[1:36:39] overwhelming thing, he goes, I'm Jewish.
[1:36:41] And he goes, to see that the Jewish
[1:36:44] people of New York came together and
[1:36:46] they all voted for that Muslim,
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And I thought, why? You know, in my
[1:36:52] mind, I'm like, why? And he says, I've
[1:36:55] got family over there. And he goes, and
[1:36:57] I asked the same question. And he says
[1:37:00] that they said that the book says that
[1:37:01] the things at the end are going to be
[1:37:04] like this. you know, the good book.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And we just want to help
[1:37:09] it speed it along."
[1:37:12] [laughter]
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Ted said it. We Why
[1:37:17] not vote for Camala Harris or you know,
[1:37:19] let's Lord, come quickly.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; We want to go home and he won't lose one
[1:37:24] of them.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; So, you know what? We are the voice.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Tell him come. Amen.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Come.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Come while Christ is still on the mercy
[1:37:34] seat.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; It's the return of the prodigals right
[1:37:37] now.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; He says they they want to see Elijah.
[1:37:42] They want to see Elijah come back.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; And so they said they're anxious. So
[1:37:46] they were trying to do what they can to
[1:37:48] help. And I thought, "Praise God.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Bring the Muslims on."
[1:37:54] God bless you.
[1:37:57] [applause]
[1:37:59] Yeah. He said he said actually he said,
[1:38:03] "Look, let's get this guy in office.
[1:38:04] Let's kind of help this uh speed along,
[1:38:07] you know, let's fast forward this
[1:38:09] thing." And he said, "We're looking for
[1:38:10] Moses and Elijah, the two witnesses to
[1:38:13] come." So, they're looking for the
[1:38:14] restoration, but there's already been a
[1:38:17] restoration of the word. Can we say amen
[1:38:19] to that? Let's stand together. I tell
[1:38:21] you, praise God. Amen. Open the eyes of
[1:38:26] my heart, Lord. Lord, open the eyes of
