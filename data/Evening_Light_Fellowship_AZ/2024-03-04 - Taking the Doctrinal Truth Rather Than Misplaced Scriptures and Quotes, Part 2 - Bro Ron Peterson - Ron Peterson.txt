heavenly father that you will take the bread of life and you will break it to us today as you did those two on the road to emus and when you break the bread their eyes came open and they saw you you

opportunity that I can stand before you but I'm not feeling as a stranger over here I'm feeling at home so I'm I'm one of the family here praise God Amen I'm son of the house so I'm thanking God to be here this is now my first time I've been here uh last year in the same month I was here and then this year we come back again and the purpose was just to go to Sunset Mountain we've been the message for a long time for many years heard about sunset Mountain reading the books C on the TS but never see sunset Mountain so when you can hear somebody talking about sunset Mountain you have your own imagination maybe you think it's looks blue maybe it's yellow you don't know how it looks like but when we get down there it's a different experience to me the way I came in is not the way I'm going back home I'm going as a change man I want to thank brother Silva I don't know if he's around here bil Silva yes he's there for guiding that wonderful brother he took care of us God bless you brother what you have done you don't even know God bless you richly amen so we originally from Congo but we live in Canada in Calgary Alberta I have a small church littleit outside of Calgary the small not big like this this is too big but we still believe in the same message amen so and I want to thank my brother over here if we came in he's the one that make all the contacts and everything he does a great job brother Joshua God bless you amen I want to thank again my brother I uh I saw him AAR never gets closer to him him but this week I got a closer to him and I find he's a wonderful man a lot of wisdom the time that we've been talking and just by his talking I got like three ceremonies that I'm going to preach to my church I was taking notes in my phone he didn't know I have them with me God bless him Rich amen the name of my little church is Sunset Tabernacle God bless you rich yeah I'm so proud of this guy amen he is my right hand man when it comes to the con God bless you brother Joshua amen you may bring many of your more other friends that have yet to come visit us anytime to come visit our church yes amen God bless you richly thank you amen let's stand together I'm amazed that you love me I'm amazed that you care oh I'm amazed that you love me how you came through your preious blood my s are there all wash my are one more time the cor [Music] oh [Applause] I'm you it's through your preious blood IED and all my S are all wash away all my sins are wash away let's just bow our heads a moment heavenly father as I lay my hands upon this sacred book A book that for hundreds and thousands of years now father you have watched over this book you have inspired men of old they spoke in Prophecy under inspir ation of the Holy Spirit and they did not understand many of the things that what they spoke knowing it might be for another time or another season but here we are at the end of this loudan age at the very end of time itself and father I thank you for your word your word is a guide it is a compass it is your thoughts in written form therefore father I pray as you inspired those men of old to write it down as they spoke by inspiration May the same holy spirit that anointed them anoint us this morning give us the isv of understanding speak to us father draw close and we'll give you praise and honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name we ask it am amen amen God bless you all let's just remain standing please if you would I want to turn to 2 Timothy chap 2: 14-8 2 Timothy Chapter 2 then we're going to turn to Revelations 22 thank you musicians I appreciate all of your servitude to the body of Christ second Timothy Chapter 2 I've got an awful lot this morning I am going to ask the technical Brethren that are doing the quotes stay with me because I'm going to go quickly and I have uh many of the things and sometimes in the quote it may be a large paragraph but there'll just be a highlighted portion I'm going to read the highlighted portion most of the time just to make reference to show you where it's at and uh uh everything so uh if I go a little too fast uh I will try not to do that I am by Nature a speed reader and if you're ever a speed reader you read your few sentences um or a few words at least ahead of your mind uh and uh definitely ahead of your tongue and so I'm going to try to slow down and get them both in Focus so that I don't slur or to uh wrongly pronounce or anything uh and leave any words out second Timothy Chapter 2 are you there amen somebody say let's go let's go all right second Timothy chapter 2 verse 14 and of these things put in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers study to show your thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more or ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hus and philetus who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of some how sad that when the word is misplaced misinterpreted dislocated it can overthrow the faith of some turn with me to the Book of Revelation chapter 22 verses 18- 21 revelation 22:18 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in the book If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testifieth these saying saith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all and we all said amen amen God bless you you can be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord amen good to see so many out to the house of the Lord and all our visitors and each and every one but to you the local faithful I say God richly bless you also amen I'm continuing on with this thought I'm hoping to try to finish uh and yet it's going to now Branch off into another direction as soon as we get done with this now understand when I take something and I try to teach from it I do a study series it's not just taking a quote or a certain subject but when I research something just so that you know how I operate I do a an exhaustive research church amen I try to read as many of the quotes as much as I can and uh sometimes my wife uh she asks me how are you doing she comes in brings me a little snack during the day or whatever and she says how are you and I said sometimes I have too much information and uh you've done so much reading so I'm asking the Lord Jesus this morning to take and try to condense everything down to bullet points or to high points uh that you can understand some things now I'm continuing on with the thought this is my title this morning taking the doctrinal truth rather than a misplaced scripture and quote I want you to understand that they took the words of Jesus and made certain doctrines and failed to take his teaching right they did the same thing with the Apostle Paul took some of his words made a Doctrine failed to take his teaching right they're doing the same thing with the message they take certain words of the prophet of God make a Doctrine fail to take his teaching what we want is the whole counsel of God now we're doing the subject of the book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life now let me just take a moment to caution you that sometimes you can get a misconstrued or a skewed picture of a Doctrine within the scripture or within the message because of isolated quotes nothing wrong with quotes right but sometimes it's the way in which they're put together or in the way in which they're over emphasized and so we know that the Bible is full of all kinds of doctrines we know that but if you preach only healing why there's more than healing right if you preach salvation there's more than just salvation and so we don't want to get high centered uh stuck on in a rut or something in doctrinal teachings otherwi wise hey hey are you ever going to get uh job off of the Ashy and so uh but uh just I've often said be careful of quotes that tend to be isolated and overemphasized now in Acts chapter 20 going to read another portion of scripture acts chap 20 verse 27-31 for I have not shown to declare unto you the all the counsel of God I like that he didn't just take one part but he said I'm not shun to declare all of the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and O and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall grievously shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves now he puts it back on them not only somebody from without but how about somebody raising up how many knows brother Ram said watch the devil will not let you stay as one happy family he said he will ra he will send somebody in from outside or raise somebody up within you shoot them full of poison next thing you know it starts going through the church he says that in a word to the church yes so also of your own selves verse 30 shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them do you see that that's what they're doing well I got a little Doctrine I got a little bit too and next thing you know brother Brenham calls them pull-offs they take a little group of people overemphasize a certain thing got a special Revelation next thing you know you ain't making it in the Rapture unless you come under this Revelation and they pull away disciples after themselves therefore Watch Remember by the space of 3 years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears so we are in the time right now of false prophets and false teachers and seducing clergy Spirits we're right in the midst of it amen excuse me now in the spoken word is the original seed for my first quote here watch what brother Ram said he says talking about the devil he didn't come through through Adam shame on you who don't see that it's not Adam's fault he had nothing to do with it if death came by Adam then it come by God death come by cross breeding death can't come by God's word death comes by cross breeding it to Don to denomination and Creed instead of Christ Dogma instead of the word it doesn't come by the word the word of the word is life amen Jesus said my words are life and the spirit quickens that word and makes it life amen to cross breed it there's where the death comes from amen paragraph 50 now Adam did not was not deceived but his bride was deceived Christ today is not deceived the word is not deceiving it's the bride that's doing the deceiving by the word what are they doing with the word now this is SoCal bride because we know the bride's not going to be deceived but he's in uh pleasing this that bride here is female if you're not careful the female gets out of her place she adds to takes away from the word of God next thing you know it's hybrid no longer has the life of the Original Seed um personally I know by experience since I came into this message that every ISM every offshoot within this message have their quotes and their scriptures every one of them and but each one of them will overemphasize a certain portion of what they believe and therefore they become exclusive we got it it's us you're not in it you're not a part of the Bride if you don't believe what we believe that sort of thing next thing you know uh the body of Christ is all divided because One Believes this one believes that I'm of sephus I'm of Paul and Paul got so upset he said I'm glad I never even baptized any of you except for gaes and a few others and he said uh unless you say I baptize you in my name now uh there are some quotes that look contradictory and there are certain things within the Bible that may appear to be of conflict or contrary one to another let me give you an example Matthew 28:19 go into all the world preach the gospel them that believe let them be baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost but on Acts chapter 2 when the Holy Spirit came down men and Brethren what do we do to be saved repent be baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost did is only a few of you know your scripture there's only two or three you said no see do you see how easily that could be so confused no one was ever baptized the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost so either they had a revelation what is the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost CU those are not names or titles we don't need to go into that so that would appear to be a contradiction well it's not a contradiction when you have Revelation and 90% of the time or greater within the message when you see something and you don't understand it is cuz you lack Revelation some where in your mind you either taught a certain uh Viewpoint of that well that's what my pastor taught me or uh that's the way I've always believed that's what I got back in pentec that's what I got over here at the Baptist Church well if you're not careful you bring all that baggage with you into the message next thing you know you've you've hybrid this message with all of your former teaching I love where the Apostle Paul said that all of my former teaching I consider as Dum that I might know Christ yes so three things we must not do to the scriptures misinterpret it misplace it or dislocate it so you cannot do that now understand when we're talking about the book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life when you do your exhaustive study on both of these subjects you will find out that the vast majority of the quotes what brother Brenham talks about the book of life he will always quote most of the time the majority of the time he who adds to and takes away talking about what a curse it is for you to misinterpret it dislocate it huh to make it say something that and what um a warning to all of us take heed under yourselves yes you think God will Overlook You by putting your own interpretation to God's word say what the word says amen don't add to it if you don't understand it just say well that's what the word says period okay now um if you take an isolated quote and you look at it you may get a little confused because you're misplacing it taking it out of context I've often said when you get a quote or a scripture take and read the whole chapter and you get you get now within that whole chapter the context of what this verse is talking about yes same way it is now I've often said that reading the spoken word books are good but it's better to hear the tape yeah why the voice has an inflection within it that's emphasizing certain things okay and so uh but if you can't listen to a tape read the book of course and um so anyway here uh in the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963 God is not known by education he is not he is not known by how to explain it now if we're not careful even I try to explain to you the third pole or the Mysteries being revealed and the prophet got himself into trouble the angel said sh amen don't try to explain it amen you do don't get your line all tangled up in times like these right any of you ever gone fishing before and got the open face reel all of a sudden you got a bird's nest everybody else is catching fish and for you for the next 20 minutes you're just you know you want to kind of drop it overboard and grab you another rod and reel but don't get your line all tangled up in a time like this in fact I caught a fish one time when I had a big old bird's nest and all of a sudden this thing I'm trying to get rid of all this line and everything and all so I just brought it in by hand anyway so watch this God is known by Simplicity and the revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person see not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ CH Upon This Rock I'll build my church now he goes on now watch this he says Watch God's Great Revelation unfolding how many of you know that this message kept unfolding to the prophet amen he didn't understand his ministry didn't understand uh this great blast the vision am I going to die goes up to to Sabino Canyon tells Billy Paul I probably am not coming home take care of the wife and kids and then you know when the sword appears into his hand and he understands and it unfolds to him this is not the end of your ministry this is the furtherance he comes running down off the mountain screaming MAA MAA I'm not going to die it's a furtherance of my Ministry it kept unfolding to him he thought it was over now now so now watch this paragraph 304 by the lack of this Revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us so much mockery so much division Among Us is because the people lack that Revelation see the lack of that Revelation the teachers what are they lacking the unfolding God in his season unfolds his word how many of you can say Amen to to that because when you were a child you thought as a child but when you became a man God unfolded greater things to you why because you were mature and could handle it plain and simple now excuse me now for this morning I want to take a detailed look at the prophet's doctrinal teaching on the book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life Is there a difference what is the correct doctrinal teaching again I told you the Book of Life in parentheses in the message is 518 times the Lamb's Book of Life in parentheses is 261 times in the book of the living He quotes it one time ancestry now watch this ancestry genealogy is God's record of a lineage and he does this and our bibles are filled with genealogies right and I don't know about you but have you ever come up and Adam beg got and he begat and this and the and the names M huh you try to enunciate the names um you'll have a hard time so anyway I want to look for a moment at some things here in the studying of the book of life within the confines of the message now remember that the vast majority of those quotes on The Book of Life all have to do and he quotes the scripture adding to and taking away from right now in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965 God had to open up the Seven Seals not in a denomination I've always been against it but out of denomination he might take a bride not a denominational bride he couldn't do it it's against his own word he opened these seven mysteries in there that shows forth brings forth those things that's been hid since the foundation of the world might be revealed in the last days two sons of God they brought that forth now before the people people that they see it there now you now to this undenominational bride raise your hand if you're one of them I'm an undenominational bride there is your two books one of them is the Lamb's Book of Life your name on there is predestinated on there yes amen it can't go because you can no more take that away than nothing else see because it was for ordained to be there amen but the regular Book of Life can take that off at any time this is doctrinal teaching now yes amen right so sardian Church age brother brandham continues all the all Escape Through Blood talking about Israel leaving Egypt all came water enjoying the Holy Spirit manifestation and blessings all ate angel food all drank of the rock that followed them we know the Bible says in that rock was Christ yet except for a very few there were not but carriers for the children who should follow them and go into the Canaan land all Israel is not Israel and all but a tiny minority had their names blotted off of The Book of Life look again continuing on this is the next paragraph down we have the same right today in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record and though contained in the Book of Life brother Bram says it's contained so the Book of Life inside the Book of Life contained within it is another book come on it's called the Lamb's Book of Life on Amen Now understand that names that are on the Book of Life you will find out that some of those names are going to be blotted out now foolish virgin will not have her name blotted out because she is said she will be there absolutely so when you look at within the message right now let me bring it down make it personal you see some that may because of whatever reason whatever excuse they leave the message they say well I don't really understand it they leave the church and when they do they start doing their own thing and here's how I see it as long as they do not reject nor to make fun of or to discredit the message of the hour it's a very good chance they will remain as foolish virgin right and be saved in the end but if they [Music] reject now that's going to be between them and God because when they come up to the that one lady even looked at the picture of the pillar of fire and smirked and he said she blasphemed God so understand this is a very very serious situation there will be names blotted out that were on there Book of Life I'm going to go into a greater detail because I want you to fully understand what brother Rim taught so there is another book that's contained in the Book of Life brother Brenham calls it an addendum to the book of light he said that's the Lamb's Book of light now the Bible says that the books were opened and these are records of genealogies of all Life Born since the foundation of the world now listen to this both seed and nonseed that's right our Bible is filled with genealogies and ancestries according to birth order and being a seed Gene of God you will find out in the SE Gene of God lineage ancestry genealogy you will never see the lineage of the serpent in there because he's not part of the amen Book of Life I'm going to get into this now I'm going to share some stuff with you so we got to look at some of the hints in the Old Testament of prophets and of men of God looking into ancestries and genealogies Nehemiah 7: 5-8 and my God put into my heart to gather together the Nobles the rulers the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy and I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first and found written therein and then he begins to say these are the children of the province that went up into captivity carried away whom Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and carried him away now watch this verse 7 who came with zerubabel jeshua Nehemiah Azariah ramiah nahani Mori ban Miss for Earth and he goes on and on that's a genealogy is it not Ezekiel picks it up in chap 13: 7-9 have you not seen a v Vision have you not spoken a lying divination whereas say the Lord saith albe it I have not spoken therefore thus sayith the Lord God because you have spoken vanity and seen lies and before behold I'm against you saith the Lord God and my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity and the Divine lies they shall not be in the Assembly of my people neither shall they be written in the writing of the House of Israel referring to books written of genealogy neither shall they enter into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord God so I want to show you a lineage of Cain because brother Brenham says I want to show you the two Vines start in Genesis follow the lineage now I'm going to show you the lineage of Cain and you will find out in the lineage of Cain there is no seed Gene of god mentioned right amen Genesis 4 verses 16- 24 it's good for you to see this and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear Enoch now this is not Enoch that we know of who is the seventh from Adam that's right two different Enochs and he build it a city this is the first one in the scripture he built a city amazing now watch brother R said watch this lineage of Cain scientific Builders yes musicians watch this and he build a the city and name of the city and after the name of his son Enoch and Enoch was born uh irad and irad begat mahul and mulio begat Mel Mel beat lamech and lamech took him two wives first time you see uh polygamy the name of one was Adam and the other name was Zilla and adab bear jabel and he was the father of such that dwell in Twins and such as have cattle now notice You'll Always Find that when there is a fight it usually was it was between the cattle herds of one and the sheep of the other yeah and did you know that really they the Egyptians thought that it was it was horrible to be a shepherd of sheep they only looked and gave preeminence to cattle in fact in our Western Civilization as it went West sheep herders were very frowned upon looked upon persecuted by the Cowboys and the land Barons and that and they ran away the Sheep killed them and all that okay so now verse 21 and his brother's name was jubel he was a father of all that's uh as all such as handled the harp and organ musical instruments and Zilla also Beed tubil can instructor of every artificer in brass and iron do you see the two two lineages brother random says now watch the lineage of God the seed Gene they're simple they're humble they're you know they till the soil they do things but he says watch King they build cities they're scientists they're smart how many of you know that the Bible says that the children of the wicked one the children of Cain are smarter than the children of God yes sir don't even try to keep up with them hey thank you now I'm not giving you all the right to quit college and to say well that's the reason I get a d instead of an a no God I want you to I know some of you is reading that in there and it Ezekiel 13 I want to show you something Ezekiel 13 oh wait a second no no no no no no I'm sorry go on now let me just go on let me appeal to this because I'm going to say something came up with this if there is a tree of life there's also a tree of De is that right which is an opposite what God had if there is a book of life there must also be another book which is a book of death or let's call it the book Book of the Dead Brother Brenham calls it the book of Sinners yes now understand that the Book of the Dead I'm just going to throw this out there and appeal to your understanding The Book of the Dead are nonseed right that's it they will never be quickened they can't believe there's nothing in them to believe they hate God and the revelation of God non seed they come from another book brother Brenham does call it the book of Sinners these are born sons of predition God hates them and they were never in the mind of God they are predestinated to Hell and Hell is reserved for the devil and his angels is that right that's what your Bible says now again we're talking about these books and I talk to you about the Book of the Dead questions and answers 63 on Genesis 53 well now brother renom do you mean to tell me there's going to be that people's going to be there at the white Throne judgment the bride will never be judged in fact the only judgment the bride gets is now and guess what it is it's self-judgment because judgment begins where House of God that's why we come here I don't want to see how good I'm doing I want to see how bad I'm doing and then I want to I want to correct myself amen the bride will never be judged now look here the Bible said judgment was set and books were opened books were opened is that right books of Sinners that's right and another book what open which is The Book of Life and every man was judged thus is that right and who was doing the judging Jesus and the Saints he came and ministered unto the Ancient of Days whose hair is white like wool and said 10,000 times 10,000s come with him minister to him in the Judgment here is King excuse me here Jesus returns as king and queen the wedding's over he's married here he said stand right here uh my right side here that's the book was was open was Sinners get over on my left and here's the ones that their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life now he's talking about three book books of Sinners Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of Life the one who is nearest to him is only those whose names were in the Lamb's Book of Life That's doctrinal teaching now So This Book of Life let me just be all inclusive right now it is a record of all C Gene and I'll explain this in a moment but without the Holy Spirit they are called foolish virgin they were bride material right they were considered for bride right same material but the pattern of the word was put on them those who will be saved because of their Works according to the law because they'll all be judged yes some are going to get eternal life because they were good to the bride somebody say bride because they were good to the bride these will all live out outside the New Jerusalem okay are we together sir now we take the Lamb's Book of Life predestinated elected of God chosen of God that's God's choosing you didn't choose him he chose you you are judged at the house of God and you will never stand before him in white Throne judgment why you're with him is that right we just read that but you will stand a judgment well brother Ron I thought the bride's not judged brother Brenham said I want to see him he's just a little bit higher right well why can't I see him because you got to be judged judged yeah according to what you did with the message that you knew to be truth well does Paul got to be judged yes sir brother R said Hallelujah I said only what Paul said so there is a we stand before the Judgment seat of God the Bible talks about and you'll be given rewards that's what the judgment is for yes to some who hid their talent they'll take it away from him and give it to one who had 10 amen imagine that in heaven God be unfair well why don't you give it to the guy that's only got two no God says Hey the guy who was faithful and all I'm going to give him even more and you that hid your talent and did nothing with it you you brought no increase to the kingdom of God I'm going to take it away from you and yet you're going to be saved so their final destination is the New Jerusalem that's right the first group their final destination is Hell thrown into the Lake of Fire second group outside the city they have salvation they have eternal life we'll look at this a little bit closer here CU I know this is a lot for you to take in the last group Lamb's Book of Life okay their Eternal destination is the city which cometh down out of Heaven adorned as a bride for her bridegroom what is it the New Jerusalem amen wow yes sir praise the Lord did you know brother Ram said there are levels in heaven okay I I'll get into that perhaps on another sermon now I'm going to give you very quickly some um scriptures that point to the destination of nonseed find it all through the scripture Matthew 23: 30 and 33 I'm get just going to read the highlighted portion wherefore be ye Witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prop prophets fill ye up the measure of your fathers ye serpents ye Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell they crucified Christ because he said you're of your father the devil that's right and his works you'll do Matthew 25: 41-46 depart from me ye cursed into Everlasting fire and prepared for the devil and his angels verse 46 and they shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal notice one is Everlasting which means Through the Ages thank God that hell is not Eternal now here is the scripture say one is Everlasting the other one is eternal life right right amen because if you had eternal life in hell and burned eternally it's still life he said there's only one form of eternal life that's comes from God 1 Peter 2: 7-8 talking about unto him he is precious but unto them which be disobedient a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were what they're appointed sorry the foola said in his heart there is no God you sir have to fulfill that scripture right that's why preaching predestination is a no no among un seed you get it because they want to say I got a choice well some of you don't now we just have to look at it according to the scripture amen okay 1 John 3 9-12 in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil children of God Children of the devil devil whosoever do doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother not his King who was of the wicked one and slew his brother he was a murderer to begin with why his father's a murderer amen yes amen and wherefore he slew his brother because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous Romans 9: 21 and 22 hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another under dishonor huh what if God show willing to show his wrath to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of Wrath what are they fitted to destruction they're made for it in fact I'll tell you what brother Brenham said and he said it may not be real nice to say it but he said some of them are Canon fodder what he said he said some are Atomic fodder right they're going to be ashes let me give you the quote amen true sign Overlook 61 I walk down the street and saw these people you talk to them they laugh at you make fun of you think what is it the other day I was walking down the street of a of the square down here I talked to some people and they just a and walked on something just said to me their atomic fod soon did be the ashes scattered upon the ground let them alone you spoke your peace get ready and get out of here something talked to him and said they're Atomic F so don't you worry about all of this these bombs and atomic this and and and all of the cuz you know what brother Bram said before one bomb hits he said bride's going to be out of here we may hear the sirens you may it may be over here this is an alert please head to the nearest bomb shelter as quickly as where are you going to go I want to ask you where's the nearest bomb shelter you talk about a penny this is not a test and and you might see a streak of sh I better get serious with God now man you do it now we don't wait for La we wait for bombs we don't wait for any of that why we get ready now somebody say now okay uh 2 Timothy 2: 19-20 nevertheless Foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his am amen but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver and also of wood and Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor I'm sorry some are made dishonorable vessels and we're seeing more and more of them in the news and we're seeing them so far out you can actually think how did we get here this isn't even normal thing uh Jude 4 for there are certain men crept inw who were before of old ordained to this condemnation right ungodly man turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ so we're talking about people like Cain like Esau like Pharaoh like the Beatles yep born sons of predition let me give you a quote on that in the sermon the token 1964 and these teenage of nonsense and rock and roll and things that we're going through all these here beetles and bugs do you know that's all represented here in the book in the Bible says it in Revelation they are dead they can't rise they never were eternal they wasn't even in the thinking so they'll perish they'll be done forever totally annihilated wow they'll be punished for eons of time for what they've done but anything that had a beginning hasn't end now let me show you because because we want to give you a scriptural definition of God choosing who he wants to love and show his grace and mercy to and the other one he hates in Romans 9: 11-8 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil for the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger and it was written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated in fact God had to correct he had to correct Isaac because Isaac loved Esau more than Jacob he had to come out and tell him Esau have I hated what shall we see then is there unrighteousness with God Hey listen if he's the author of the book doesn't the author of the book have the right to put the bad guy in there and he in the end he's toast right oh well you you I just don't like that bad guy meeting a bad end you ought to you know do something sorry I'm the author that's how he wrote it what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so it's not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth amen amen Pharaoh sorry buddy but I Rose you up so God's going to give Mercy onto whom he will and to whom he doesn't he doesn't some I'm sorry and maybe you've never heard this before but some are predestinated to go to hell they have no choice right there was nothing in them there is non seed they have no ability there is no sounding post there is no reciprocation there is no ear to hear there is no eye to see right and guess what God can't deal with them because they're illegitimate children do you think he corrects them he don't waste his time time only a Son of God only genealogy that's his my sheep know my voice stranger they won't follow so the Book of Life let's talk about the book of life because the Book of the Dead and Sinners and that I went to a I went to a Mexican food restaurant the other day what is it called the bar Easter bario something bario over here off of the freeway Sandy and I went there everything around it all skulls skulls dead I said is this place got good food it looks like you're advertising the otherwise am I going to die eating this stuff cuz there were skulls everywhere worshiping the Deads anyway I you see any first and last time to eat there okay look book of life thank you book of life let's go into that these are the Justified Sanctified yet they lack the baptism of the Holy Ghost foolish virgin they are the sheep that show up at White Throne judgment and they will live outside the new New Jerusalem and some like Judas showed their colors and reject the word and they're doing it in this message now remember I said reject the word make fun of it speak against it get these chat things and YouTubes and why I left the message and their names are blotted out blott it out now there are others foolish virgin who never got the Holy Ghost right and so they lack the wisdom that the Holy Ghost in leading them and guiding them into all truth they're not diligent about keeping themselves ready for the coming of the Lord my Lord delays his coming right and they are foolish now they are saved but not adopted amen right they are saved but not sealed because when you are sealed you are sealed until the day of your Redemption amen amen that's doctrinal teaching yes so um I'm going to say this and then I will go back a little bit later and and declare a little a little bit about you about this they were saved before the lamb leaves The Mercy Seat because we're going to go into some doctrinal teaching here in a little bit to just show you some stuff uh now brother Fernando Torres who's been a really special guy with a gift and he can make grass for me he went ahead and just the last couple Services he said hey further on I think I'm going to make you a little graph I'm going to send it to you so he made a picture would you go ahead and show the first one here of the record of the wheat plant now if you guys all see that says not all of the we plant was seed cuz remember there is Shu that's not even air but it's all the record of the church when you understand brother R's teaching says names can can be blotted out for rejecting the word Judas I like how he put Judas and he put a red x on it his name blotted out some are allowed to enter into the kingdom for being kind to God's elect to the bride right see they'll be given eternal life because they did something for the bride before the bride is gone think of this I I just stirring your mind here a little bit I'm just playing with you a little bit you think they're going to be saved just at White Throne judgment because all of a sudden they'll come over to you and say hey y don't you remember the time and I I want to be good to you and you know come on please no no no no no no right they were good to the bride before the bride left before the blood left The Mercy Seat before the sacrifice was done before the Gentile day was closed because when the time of the Gentiles is over blood leaves The Mercy Seat it becomes judgment seat and the lamb becomes the lion yes judgment strikes bride goes up in the days of the Gentiles Pho done if you didn't get in before that time you ain't getting in because even that white throne judgement you're going to be judged for what you did back then before blood left The Mercy Seat that's right doctrinal teaching because brother Brena multitudes of time once that last Gentile comes in and the day of Grace is over and he said there'll not be another one saved am is that what he said take his doctrinal teaching yes sir amen and he said there'll be a time period after the last ones come in and maybe a period of time of grace and the church goes right on thinking everybody's getting saved and he said they not already been sealed the do already been closed that's why brother Bram said and I can show you quote after quote whatever you do get in now get in now cuz when you get over there it's too late yes and once he leaves The Mercy Seat and it becomes judgment and it changes from lamb to Lion there'll not be no more salvation for the Gentiles that's right God turns and goes to the Jews you understand so even the foolish virgin for the three and a half years of tribulation and they have to be martyred are they going to get saved because they did something in the three and 1/2 years of tribulation no why they're being judged because of how foolish they were with what they knew to do and they didn't do it so he said so I've got to purge him right and now there's no more blood but because without the shedding of blood there is no sacrifice right and so now what blood because blood's left the mercy SE it's over so whose blood has to be it's their blood by the blood of their own testimony right but the Salvation listen to me carefully came before he left the mercy seat right amen so when they show up as sheep among goats at White Throne I want to ask you God's sheep why are God's sheep there at White Throne are they granted salvation at White Throne no they were already sheep because we want to take the doctrinal teachings of what he said now let me go into this okay very nice they are predestinated oh then they ask about when was I naked you clothed me when was I hungry and you fed me okay remember this is second Resurrection you guys see that right here second Resurrection okay so this is the record of the wheat The Book of Life why white Throne remember all of the Dead came before the white throne and was judged both great and small bride is she judged at White Throne no Doctrine no you're not going to be judged at White Throne okay let's let's go on now with with some more of this um let's go to the Lamb's Book of Life Now understand it's an extension or an addendum of the original book of life only the elect or the predestinated and ordained seed can be recorded in that book they are sealed to the day of their Redemption their names cannot be stricken off that book brother Brenham said because it's WR their names are written in his blood Book of Life you can have your name taken on Lamb's Book of Life predestinated elected you were there you were with him you were in him there's no way that yes sir I could get real excited and start come on brother amen yes so here's Lamb's Book of Life Look At This Book of Life The Royal seed section the DNA the seed gen of God yes you understand that this is God's choosing his election and let's look at this God's attributes in the mind of God if you are a son of God you always were a Son of God now we're I want to go beyond just calling I want to go to election the record of the great Royal seed Samson Moses David Abel Abraham Noah Peter Joseph Paul Jeremiah John Luther Wesley on and on chosen win before the foundation of the world they are Zoe God's own life eternal life moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called he Justified whom he justified them he glorified I want to ask you who can lay any sin to the charge of God's elect neither life nor death nor principality nor things present nor things to come shall be able to separate you from the love of God why you've been United with your your king and it's been an invisible Union and once you've had that invisible Union you are united with him and you stand as him and he cannot be judged a second time why he already was judged for your sin he became me that I might become him Hallelujah names can never be blotted out Hallelujah blessed be the name the Lord here's the problem et's doctrinal teaching the elect bride can never have her name stricken off of the Lamb's Book of Life in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken now I want to show you we're going to go to some quotes here now for just a moment and your brethren I'm skipping a little bit here now so we're under the one called The Book of Life and here are some questions this let's go to the patas vision so if you'll find the quote on Pat Miss Vision 1960 now there's another question here that was given me last evening brother brandom are the five foolish virgins of Matthew 25 counted as the Gentile Remnant now you have to understand your Bible and you have to understand this question and if you all go look at Matthew 25 you'll understand the context of this question I understand that the five foolish virgins were saved but have to go through the Great Tribulation period is this correct if so what will be their final destination could they be the Sheep which are divided from the goats in Matthew 2533 and 34 brother brenaman pretty good Theologian I think it too that they are the remnant sleeping virgin is the Remnant spoken of in Revelation a woman will take a piece of goods lay it down well now that's uh what she's cutting she takes her pattern lays anywhere she Desires in which way she's going to cut that then that which is left over is called The Remnant and she chooses to cut it from a certain place by her own free thinking that's what left over is the remnant right amen now there is a place where brother Brandon what he he uses the bride and he uses the name Remnant well we know that's the remnant well according to his doctrinal teaching no bride is not Remnant right foolish virgin is Remnant right okay so uh here's questions answers on the seals after the Rapture has taken place raptures taking place up the gun and a moment in twinkling of an eye will any of the church be saved in the end who was not taken in the Rapture no uhuh what Rapture is taking place anybody going to be getting saved Gentile dea's Grace is over cuz the blood's done left yeah you see there'll be no intercessions the Gentile age is finished there'll be no one saved after the Rapture none of the church so let me just pop your bubble if some of you are saying well you know what I I I just may be foolish virgin let me tell you you better get right and get saved here now amen because after the Rapture ain't nobody getting saved none of the church that won't take place not after the church is gone now again there's where he puts church and bride and he he should have said bride but I'm not going to say that I'm just going to say we all know church amen so here 1964 after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgin be saved or will they all be lost now understand as he reads these questions there's two or three so he's answering maybe the second question after he just read the first because you see he he said after the brightest Rapture will any of the foolish virgin be saved or will they all be lost now his doctrine of teaching yes she's saved yes amen she is saved yes so when he answers it no he's answering no to or will they all be lost no they'll not be lost see everything will be finished for the Gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth spirit of God leaves the Earth he that's filthy is filthy still he that's righteous righteous still he that's holy holy still right Sanctuary becomes Smokey attorney stands to pleed the case Christ leaves the sanctuary his day of mediatorial is over the Rapture comes he leaves from the sanctuary Goes Forth takes the book of redemption and this is going to be interesting because I'm going to Branch off into this what book is it that he has in his right hand yeah what is this title deed of redemption that Adam lost right we're going to look at a closer look at the book that's taken and why do you got to eat it and he claims everything he redeemed there's no more mediatorial word yes times of the Gentiles is over uhhuh uh the dispensation ceased God returns back to the Jews blood leaves a mercy seat turns to judgment lamb turns to a lion at that time there will not be another Gentile sa whoever gets saved gets saved now amen before the Rapture amen Mary's belief 1959 remember this is the ending of the Gentile dispensation remember it's thus sayith the Lord It's a time for the Gentiles age to cease and when the Gentile age ceases then the gospel goes to the Jew and it's all over then wow 1964 questions and answers will the foolish virgin be saved no whatever happens happens now somebody say now now after that time she's in that state now she will go through the tribulation period and that's the reason of it is is we can because she rejected the atonement in its fullness she is a Believer a professed believer she'll have to go through the tribulation period brother Brenham told Billy Paul he said Billy whatever you do you want to miss that yes you want to miss that tribulation now let me finish up with a couple quotes here on again I'm going to take a little bit more time is that okay because I I want to be finished with this in Revelations 13 and Revelations 21 it talks about Lamb's Book of Life Revelations 13: 7 and 8 and all that dwell on the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the life of the Lamb the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world do you know even foolish virgin because they're foolish because they don't have the wisdom and discernment of the holy spirit will have a part of that that's where right wrong kind of worship anyway Revelations 21: 27 shall in no wise enter in anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or I'm going to paraphrase that and say who weareth Abomination if a woman wears clothes pertaining to a man it's an Abomination is that right it's your Bible now sis which one of you are going to say it's okay I'll wear I'll just wear uh pair of pants with when I'm you know when I go play tennis when I go skiing when I go horp writing huh what if you can't do it in the skirt don't do it oh yeah I know you're thinking I'm getting too hard neither whatsoever worketh abominate or maketh a lie lying is as bad as an Abomination a little white lie it's okay yeah but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life here's the prophet's doctrinal teaching concerning Lamb's Book of Life sardian Church age 284 now we can see why the redeemed bought back by the original owner the redeemed he now says bride parentheses she was in him as Eve was in Adam cannot ever have her member names taken off of the record amen that's right she's part of him she is in the throne yes she can never be judged every one of the bright is a member of him and he loses none Hallelujah yes but that that's not so concerning the all in the Book of Life for amongst them are even those like Judas who have a part in the record but their names are removed Jesus will say that he never knew them they were not forn as in the bride and neither were they forn as among the righteous of the second Resurrection second Resurrection blessed are they who are partakers of what the first resurrection what's first resurrection Rapture and the rest of the Dead live not for what Thousand Years thousand years when do they show up white thrown judgment that's where the Sheep come up they have no other court of appeal they miss the Rapture then as we have previously shown there are those who stood for the bride and were an aid and comfort to her those had their names remaining on the book of life and go into life Everlasting finally there are those such as pharaoh who never had their names on on the book of life and these are cast in the Lake of Fire also brother randam in the sermon I will restore watch those two Vines Jesus said let them grow together I want you to notice another place we could bring Esau and Jacob if you wanted to before either was born God Ela J Jacob by election that's what's a matter today we're having these revivals all over the country it's nothing but ProTrac of meetings what we need today is not stand up and account Christ as our personal savior but Get Down On Our Knees until you're filled with the Holy Ghost repent and be baptized amen God seals you into the kingdom of God that's what your church needs today get your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life it'll stay there forever amen amen somebody say amen amen sir hear ye him but God these tonight has raised their feet let the recording Angel put every name down for they standing for Jesus night confessing their sins accepting him as their personal savior God put their names on the land Book of Life knowing it can never be blotted out Revelation 561 the enemy in the last days that religious enemy would get amongst the people and have organizations and so forth and Cults as we have today and would deceive the very elected if it were impossible and would deceive all those whose names are not put on the Lamb's Book of Life since the foundation of the world when was your name put on the Lamb's Book of life before the foundation of the world when was Christ slain 1900 years ago no sir before the foundation of the world the the lamb slain before the foundation of the world see what it's doing it's these seals opening up just beginning to reveal the Plan of Redemption sir yes sir amen because the title deed that he has in his hand right it's the title deed that Adam lost because he was disobedient right it went back into the hands of the original owner thank you Lord amen that's what Revelation 10 is all about listen the first part of redemption is Calvary amen he paid the price yes yes sir amen but he didn't take the possession do you understand amen do you know what the Rapture is take the book names brother Brenham said when he grabs the book he's taking those whose names are represented in the Lamb's Book of Life and he Chas him thank you Lord first part of redemption the blood Calvary right second part he takes the book out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne right who's worthy Revelation 5 no one in Earth or in heaven no one worthy right and John got so shook up he started to cry he turned away and as he's walking away he heard a voice behind him weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah have reveiled watch this the lion hath prevailed and I turned to look and I saw a lamb yes sir slain before the foundation of the world and now John take the book I'm getting into the previews of what I'm going to take this off into why is Revelations 10 so important to us it is the seventh seal it is the coming of the Lord it is about predestination it is about election it is about him taking the bookah don't you just think about this message get into it because this message is Christ praise God amen truth brother Hallelujah wonderful the second seal 63 but there is some that's got their names written on the Lamb's Book of Life and when them seals are thrown open there they see their names there yes amen and the Holy Spirit speaks to them Hallelujah and they come yep amen amen amen hallelujah he opens up the word and you look you know what he's doing he's calling your name yes sir God Adam yes amen Adam you see it they see their name brother Bram says you don't have to see a physical name of your name and he says but you see the conditions Hallelujah you see the conditions of the time and you see what God is doing and you say that's me Mama I see a reflection that's me he ain't talking about somebody else he talking about me be it unto me according to Thy word oh God I don't pass it off to another haar I take it to my bosom amen I embrace the promises of God for the bride for this hour hallelujah amen and the bride has made herself amen hallelujah praise the Lord now here's musicians go ahead and come now here's the last quote wow I want to talk about the original name of yours that was written in the Lamb's Book of Life because to the Overcomers is given a white stone and on that stone is written a new name yes sir come on listen to this perg me in church age I'm going to read it slow is Justin's walking slowly pergan Church age it's also says here that he's going to give the Overcomer a white stone and in not on the stone a new name which the owner alone knows now the idea of a new name is a famili one Abram was changed to Abram Sarah to Sarah Jacob to Israel Simon to Peter Saul to Paul these names either brought about a change or were given because of a change it was only after Abram and Sarah had their names Changed by by the Lord that they had made ready to to receive the coming son in Jacob's case he had to overcome and then he was called a prince in the case of Simon and Saul they had received the Lord their change came and today each one of us True Believers has had a change in name we are Christians Hallelujah yes it is a name common to all of us but one day there'll be another change we will certainly have receive a new name amen it could well be that name that was our true an original name written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world he knows the name we do not one day at his good pleasure am we will know also amen amen let's stand together if you would please for a [Music] moment pardon [Music] me next service I will go ahead and try to go over some of the questions given to me son of man Ministry some of the different things we'll look at it and I want to take a look at the book that we're supposed to eat what book is it and when we take it what does it do to us yes what do we become after we eat it right because there's an effect yes amen you eat something you take this Revelations 108 and John took the book and he ate it bitter in his stomach and you know sweet in his mouth because now thou must prophesy yes we have a job to do we must be about our father's business the final voice was not William brandom it wasn't the seventh angel right there's another voice in the [Music] land for she will be the final voice to the final age Lord use my voice Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of

coming of the Lord amen I want to be one of those that receives a body change while I'm still in this body in a moment the twinkling of an eye and we shall all be changed cuz God will not allow a byproduct of sin to come into His presence amen he's going to let you be changed and you shall be given another body one that's in similar in fashion to the one that you got now if you wear glasses you won't wear glasses H praise God if you don't have any hair you'll have some hair if you don't have any teeth you'll have teeth amen it's going to be so Supernatural since I came into this message
