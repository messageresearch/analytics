[29:09] thy Kingdom's glory in Jesus Christ's
[29:12] name amen and amen praise the Lord God
[29:15] bless you this evening if you have your
[29:17] Bibles turn with me to the book of First
[29:20] Kings chapter 21 we'll read verses 1-6
[29:25] thank you so much musicians we just
[29:26] greet you all in the lovely name of
[29:28] Jesus Christ and it's certainly an honor
[29:30] and a privilege to be here this evening
[29:33] can you say Amen
[29:35] am amen First Kings CH 21 we'll read
[29:40] verses
[29:42] 1-6 and it came to pass after these
[29:45] things that Nebo the jezreelite had a
[29:47] Vineyard which was in jezel hard by the
[29:51] Palace of Ahab king of Samaria that
[29:53] means it was close to his Palace and
[29:56] Ahab spake onto nebba say give me thy
[29:58] Vineyard that I may have it for a garden
[30:00] of herbs because it is near onto my
[30:03] house and I will give thee for it a
[30:05] better Vineyard than it or if it seem
[30:08] Good To Thee I will give Thee the worth
[30:11] of it in money and Nebo said unto Ahab
[30:14] the Lord forbid it me that I should give
[30:17] the inheritance of my fathers onto thee
[30:21] and Ahab came into his house heavy and
[30:23] displeased because uh of the word which
[30:26] Nebo the jezrael had spoken to him for
[30:29] he had said I will not give Thee the
[30:31] inheritance of my fathers and he laid
[30:33] him down upon his bed and turned away
[30:36] his face and would eat no bread amen you
[30:40] may be seated this evening in the
[30:42] presence of the
[30:43] Lord I would like to title my sermon
[30:46] this evening this is nebus Vineyard part
[30:49] two and I would like to take for uh
[30:52] subject your inheritance amen whenever
[30:56] we read our Bible
[30:58] uh brother Bram often has taught us he
[31:02] he said don't read your Bible as you're
[31:04] reading a newspaper or a story book in
[31:07] other words he said don't read your
[31:09] Bible on surface level don't just read
[31:13] it like like it's some kind of fation
[31:16] story or or just some people of history
[31:19] but he told us to read between the lines
[31:22] whenever we read our Bibles and he said
[31:24] it's of great importance of for us to
[31:28] whenever we read our Bibles to read with
[31:31] understanding and to read with
[31:34] Revelation to read between the lines to
[31:37] understand the the shadows and the types
[31:40] of what the scripture is talking about
[31:42] because when we miss the shadows and the
[31:44] types especially in the Old Testament uh
[31:48] we pretty much miss the whole Testament
[31:50] uh because the Old Testament is is
[31:52] always pointing towards something else
[31:56] whenever we see a a a story whether it
[31:58] be the high priest or whether it be
[32:00] Abraham and Sarah and and so on and so
[32:03] forth though it was it was their life
[32:06] and though it was them acting out their
[32:08] part in Christ yet the Old Testament was
[32:11] always pointing towards a future event
[32:15] though it was real for them yet it was
[32:17] for a future event like you and I that
[32:20] we could read it with understanding and
[32:23] not only read it but relate to the story
[32:26] of what we're reading so it can be
[32:28] applied to our lives in this very day so
[32:31] if we just read it as a story book and
[32:33] if we just read it uh uh word for word
[32:36] and verse for verse and forget to read
[32:39] between the lines there's no hope for us
[32:42] really of applying the type to our
[32:46] lives and so and and that's like very
[32:49] important for us as Believers is we want
[32:52] to take the word and we want to
[32:55] understand the word we want to take the
[32:57] word and we want to apply the word
[32:59] because when the word is applied the
[33:01] word becomes
[33:04] life excuse
[33:07] me here we
[33:09] go you're okay until you start
[33:13] preaching and so we find out that that's
[33:16] why it's so important for us uh this
[33:19] message is so important for us as
[33:22] Believers because when we read our
[33:24] Bibles and I've I've said it quite often
[33:27] and I'll continue to say it because I
[33:29] believe that it's the truth that it's
[33:32] important for us to read our Bibles
[33:34] through prophetic Insight through the
[33:37] glasses of a a a prophetic messenger in
[33:39] this day because when we read the
[33:42] scripture through prophetic Insight it
[33:44] is actually the very Mind Of God that's
[33:47] being translated to you and I of this
[33:50] scripture that we are reading and so
[33:52] there's no higher order than what God
[33:55] reveals the word than through his
[33:57] servants the prophets so when we're
[34:00] listening to tapes when we're studying a
[34:03] sermon we're listening to what brother
[34:05] brandham said we're not just letting it
[34:07] go through one ear and out the other ear
[34:10] but we've got to ponder upon those
[34:12] things and when he teaches us a type
[34:14] within the scripture we must lock the
[34:17] type in our hard drive and say wow
[34:19] brother brandham said that this symbol
[34:21] means this so whenever you read your
[34:24] Bible and you see the symbol within the
[34:26] scripture it's not the symbol it's the
[34:29] mystery that's hidden beneath the symbol
[34:32] is what we want to understand
[34:36] amen and in the sermon the restoration
[34:39] of the Bride tree brother brandham said
[34:41] she is sitting here on the throne today
[34:44] in this country remember just like Ahab
[34:46] did and Jezebel behind him the Bible
[34:49] calls the Catholic Church Jezebel
[34:53] prostitute did were we able to get the
[34:56] quotes brethren
[34:58] we were was it up there look at that I
[35:01] need eyes in the back of my head because
[35:02] it wasn't up there I
[35:05] apologize so we see then that every time
[35:08] that we see the scripture about Jezebel
[35:12] our our mind should be going back to a
[35:15] brother brandham and seeing the mystery
[35:18] behind the type of Jezebel and
[35:21] understand that it's talking about the
[35:23] Catholic Church yes it's talking about
[35:26] Jezebel but it's also talking about
[35:29] another Spirit that's behind Jezebel cuz
[35:32] brother Bram said this people die but
[35:34] Spirits do not die so the spirit of
[35:37] Jezebel lives on today just as strong as
[35:41] it was back when it dwelt inside Jezebel
[35:45] herself just as the Holy Spirit God will
[35:47] take the man off the scene but the holy
[35:50] spirit is still
[35:52] here praise the Lord that's why the
[35:54] promise is onto you and to your children
[35:57] and to your children's children he never
[35:59] takes the promise away even when the man
[36:02] goes off the
[36:04] scene Hallelujah so when we read about
[36:07] Jezebel we are reading about the
[36:10] Catholic church so when we read in
[36:12] Revelation CH 2 and verse 20 it says
[36:14] notwithstanding I have a few things
[36:16] against thee because thou sufferest that
[36:19] woman Jezebel which calls herself a
[36:21] prophetes to teach and seduce my
[36:24] servants to commit fornication and to
[36:26] heat eat things
[36:28] sacrificed onto Idols what's it talking
[36:31] about the Catholic church amen it's
[36:34] talking about the Catholic Church here
[36:36] in the tharan church age which is the
[36:39] fourth Church age where where where we
[36:42] understand this spirit that was was was
[36:45] driving this move of religion was
[36:48] driving the religious people of that day
[36:51] to do drastic things in order to get the
[36:54] people to recant and to bow down to a c
[36:57] certain system a certain ideology a
[37:00] certain way of living taking away the
[37:03] Holy Spirit out of the people taking it
[37:06] away from the grasps of the people I
[37:08] should say that they should serve a
[37:11] system rather than
[37:15] God
[37:18] hallelujah Revelation 17 1 through6 and
[37:22] there came one of the Seven Angels which
[37:24] had the seven vials and talked with me
[37:26] saying unto me come up hither and I will
[37:28] show Thee the Judgment of the great
[37:30] that sth upon many Waters with
[37:32] whom the kings of the Earth have
[37:34] committed fornication and the
[37:36] inhabitants of the Earth have been made
[37:38] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[37:40] who's it talking about it's talking
[37:42] about this Jezebel spirit is talking
[37:45] about mystery Babylon which we know is
[37:48] who the Catholic church amen not the
[37:53] people but the system brother brandham
[37:57] said this
[37:58] because when you when you begin to uh
[38:00] especially when you go through your
[38:02] church age book and you begin to see the
[38:04] works of the Catholic church and you
[38:06] begin to see uh mystery Babylon the
[38:09] great uh uh the Bible says the great
[38:11] and she has daughters and they're
[38:13] prostitutes and and and if we're not
[38:15] careful we get to have something against
[38:18] the people that's within denominational
[38:21] churches and we get to think and we get
[38:23] to thinking well uh maybe there's nobody
[38:25] saved outside of the Bride of Jesus
[38:27] Christ maybe it's just those who are
[38:30] within the gra uh the the the grasp of
[38:33] the message Under the Umbrella of the
[38:35] message are the only ones that's going
[38:37] to be in heaven in that day which is not
[38:40] true cuz brother brandham said there's
[38:42] good people and every one of those
[38:45] organizations and so it's not up to us
[38:48] to say well it's it's just the message
[38:51] and it's no more but I can say this that
[38:54] that only the bride which is under the
[38:57] umbrella of the message will be in the
[38:59] New Jerusalem only the bride that has
[39:02] the oil and is sealed until the day of
[39:05] her Redemption has a mansion in this New
[39:08] Jerusalem so not everybody even in
[39:11] quotation within the message will be in
[39:14] the New Jerusalem if if they're if
[39:17] they've got if they've had an experience
[39:19] with Christ they'll be in heaven they
[39:22] got eternal life they got no less
[39:25] eternal life than those who have the
[39:27] seal of God but yet they're not within
[39:30] the city
[39:32] walls and so who are we to say well
[39:36] because that person goes there and that
[39:39] church person belongs to that church who
[39:42] are we to get so judgmental and say Well
[39:44] they're not going to make it because
[39:46] they're not like you and
[39:48] I help us Lord I say father help us so
[39:52] we don't get so judgmental against other
[39:55] people amen
[39:58] because we don't know who's God's and
[40:01] who's not
[40:02] God's
[40:04] amen but yet I'll still preach about
[40:07] this against the system not against the
[40:11] people
[40:12] amen thank you Lord and so it says and
[40:15] he carried me away verse three into the
[40:18] spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a
[40:20] woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[40:23] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[40:26] heads and 10 horns horns and the woman
[40:29] was arrayed in
[40:32] purple out of all the colors that should
[40:35] be arrayed in she would be array in
[40:39] purple now was it an actual woman that
[40:43] John was seeing yeah it was a woman he
[40:46] wondered at her beauty she was decked in
[40:48] purple but yet it was the spirit of
[40:52] Jezebel mystery Babylon it was the
[40:55] church amen
[40:57] The Mystery of the woman is the
[41:02] church Hallelujah you know most people
[41:05] no doubt they'll read their Bibles and
[41:08] they'll say uh oh yeah here's a woman
[41:11] brother brandham teaches us this a woman
[41:13] in the church a woman in the Bible is a
[41:15] type of the church so what do we do
[41:18] Under the teachings of Malachi 4 every
[41:21] time we see a Woman Within scripture we
[41:24] think church because we're looking at
[41:26] the mystery underneath the symbol that's
[41:30] what I mean like when we take these
[41:33] symbols and these teachings that brother
[41:35] brandham shows us now we don't read our
[41:37] Bible well it's it's just a woman and
[41:40] Sarah was just a woman and this person
[41:42] was just a woman no Sarah and Hagar they
[41:45] were women but there were two churches
[41:47] right there was one spiritual and there
[41:50] was one carnal and the carnal one always
[41:53] persecuted the spiritual one and so
[41:56] because we understand
[41:57] the symbols underneath it we can
[42:01] understand the types within the
[42:02] scripture that plays the whole way down
[42:05] into the end time because it's always
[42:08] the carnal and the religious that
[42:11] persecutes the spiritual because bride
[42:14] cannot persecute bride
[42:17] amen so here was this woman dressed in
[42:20] purple and scarlet color and decked with
[42:23] gold and precious stones and pearls and
[42:26] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[42:28] Abominations and
[42:30] filthiness of her
[42:32] fornication though she looked pretty and
[42:34] she was something to be wandered after
[42:37] yet within herself she was full of
[42:40] filthiness and fornications and
[42:43] Abominations and and and on her forehead
[42:46] was a name written mystery Babylon the
[42:48] great the mother of harlots and
[42:51] Abominations of the earth and I saw the
[42:54] woman drunken with the blood of the
[42:55] Saints and with the blood of the the
[42:57] martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I
[43:00] wandered with great
[43:03] admiration wow what a sight this must
[43:07] have been that brother that that that
[43:10] John would would be caught up and he
[43:12] would and he would see these visions and
[43:14] and he would and he would see the the
[43:16] rest of the history of mankind would
[43:19] play out before him in symol form and
[43:22] everything he saw he was writing it down
[43:25] and and I saw this and I saw this woman
[43:27] woman and I and I saw that and I saw a
[43:29] beast and and I saw a red beast and a
[43:31] pale one and and all these different
[43:33] things and and he's just writing as he
[43:35] sees it but yet it's a book of symbols
[43:37] but when we understand the symbols
[43:40] through prophetic Insight now we can
[43:43] understand and and and this is the thing
[43:46] whenever you begin to see uh whenever
[43:49] you understand a spirit you can see its
[43:53] characteristics when it begins to rise
[43:55] up in your own life life and a family
[43:58] member's life are in the life of the
[44:01] church and whenever you can see a spirit
[44:04] and you understand its characteristics
[44:07] then you know you need to do something
[44:09] about it otherwise you're just walking
[44:12] through life with blinkers on not
[44:14] knowing spiritual things I say father
[44:16] give us a little bit of spiritual uh
[44:20] understanding H uh in order to be able
[44:22] to discern an evil spirit when it begins
[44:25] to try to rise up in our
[44:30] lives the exposition of the seven Church
[44:33] ages the thire and age brother brandom
[44:35] says and in this saaran age uh she is a
[44:39] dominating female she is Mystery Babylon
[44:42] she is the great she is Jezebel
[44:45] the false prophetes why because the true
[44:48] female I love how brother brandham does
[44:50] this he he never leaves us ever in uh uh
[44:54] you know in a downer he always brings
[44:57] the opposite side he says why because
[44:59] the true female is submissive to God so
[45:02] why is this church the opposite why is
[45:04] she dominating dominating and
[45:06] domineering and all those different
[45:08] things it's because there is a woman
[45:10] there is a church that is submissive to
[45:14] her God there is a woman who was
[45:17] submissive to the word of God for her
[45:19] day that's why there's so much false out
[45:22] in the world today is because there's
[45:24] somebody that's real there's some that
[45:27] really loves God there's somebody that's
[45:29] really serving God there's somebody
[45:32] that's really applying the word to their
[45:34] lives that's why there's so much fake
[45:37] that's why there's so much hypocrisy
[45:39] that's why there's so much lies within
[45:41] Christianity because the real thing is
[45:46] here but what about this church she is
[45:49] she has cast out the word destroyed the
[45:53] Bibles and worthy essays of The Godly
[45:56] she has slain those who would preach the
[45:58] truth she has taken over Kings princes
[46:01] and Nations uh controls armies and
[46:04] insists that she is the True Body of
[46:05] Christ and that our Popes are the
[46:07] vickors of Christ she is entirely
[46:10] seduced by the devil wow until she in
[46:13] turn has become the Seducer of
[46:17] others so if she's been seduced by Satan
[46:20] and now seduces others if we have been
[46:23] quickened by the word we can also
[46:26] Quicken others by the same word that
[46:29] we've been quickened
[46:30] by Sir he says she is the Bride of Satan
[46:34] and has produced uh these illegitimate
[46:38] uh child religions all through the Dark
[46:40] Ages she has dominated for over 900
[46:43] years she plundered and destroyed she
[46:45] killed the Arts destroyed the Sciences
[46:48] produced nothing but death until the
[46:50] light of the truth was almost entirely
[46:51] gone and only the bearest sliver of
[46:55] light remained the oil and the wine had
[46:58] almost ceased to flow but but though she
[47:01] dominated the world kingdoms and
[47:02] demanded that all men find her citizen
[47:05] Citizenship in her there was a little
[47:07] group who belonged to God and their
[47:09] citizenship was in heaven Hallelujah and
[47:12] them she could not destroy they
[47:14] understand that Satan can do whatever he
[47:17] wants to try and to destroy the seed
[47:19] that's within your life but Faith the
[47:22] faith of God the S gen of God in your
[47:25] life will not be over come by Satan it
[47:28] doesn't matter what comes it doesn't
[47:30] matter what goes because greater is he
[47:33] who is within you than he who's within
[47:36] the
[47:39] world they could not be destroyed this
[47:42] Church of Rome was a heathen wicked as
[47:44] Queen uh aalia who tried to destroy all
[47:47] the Royal seed and almost succeeded but
[47:49] God preserved one and of him there came
[47:51] more of the faithful Hallelujah isn't it
[47:54] amazing what God can do with one man in
[47:56] his his hands you know what God can do
[47:59] with you if you would fully Surrender
[48:01] Your Heart to Christ all he needs is one
[48:07] person so God preserved the little flock
[48:09] in that long dark night and of their
[48:12] truth they finally arose a Luther you
[48:16] see Jezebel has always been trying her
[48:18] best to kill the influence of God
[48:22] amongst God's people we find there in
[48:25] the book of Kings when you read it and
[48:27] especially when Elijah has uh there's
[48:29] been the Mount Carmel Showdown and he's
[48:32] ran away from Jezebel in the word and
[48:34] she said uh uh your your life is going
[48:36] to be as the life of those men that you
[48:38] took uh this time tomorrow when he flees
[48:41] and he runs and he goes to a cave and
[48:44] God asks him and he says Elijah what
[48:47] doest thou here why are you here Elijah
[48:50] and Elijah responds and says oh I'm
[48:52] running from my life because the uh all
[48:55] the prophets of the Lord have been
[48:58] slain so we see and and he thought he
[49:00] was the only one that was
[49:02] left and so we see that this this
[49:05] Jezebel or this Spirit of Jezebel if you
[49:08] want to call it that way what did she do
[49:11] she killed the prophets of the Lord for
[49:13] what purpose because she wanted to kill
[49:16] the influence of The Godly Man upon the
[49:19] people of Israel and when she killed the
[49:21] influence of God amongst the People by
[49:25] taking the man off the scene she erected
[49:28] altars onto baale and onto these other
[49:30] gods that she served you see that's what
[49:32] Satan wants to do in this day That's
[49:35] what Satan wants to do in your life the
[49:38] spirit of Jezebel wants to kill the
[49:40] influence of God and godly man in your
[49:43] life and he's going to bring in an altar
[49:46] of other things within your life if
[49:48] you're not influenced by the right
[49:52] thing Satan can rise up amongst a body
[49:56] of
[49:58] Believers a Jezebel spirit and tried to
[50:01] kill the influence of the pastor amongst
[50:04] the
[50:05] people well how does he do that do they
[50:09] uh uh does Satan does somebody rise up
[50:11] or come into the church with a gun and
[50:13] and and and shoot the pastor while he's
[50:15] preaching and and uh and all these
[50:17] different things no what does he do
[50:21] somebody raises up with a root of
[50:24] bitterness in their heart and all of a
[50:27] sudden they start saying things about
[50:28] the pastor about the deacons about the
[50:32] preachers about the associates God
[50:35] forbid huh
[50:37] amen for what
[50:40] purpose because they're anointed by
[50:42] another Spirit that's right and let me
[50:45] share this with you it is not the spirit
[50:47] of
[50:49] God the spirit of God will not cause you
[50:53] to seow a seed of Discord amongst the
[50:56] the
[50:57] church against one another against
[51:01] family members against any member within
[51:03] the church why because bride cannot
[51:06] persecute
[51:08] bride but what happens is when a spirit
[51:11] of Jezebel Rises up within a Believer
[51:15] all of a sudden with their
[51:18] words they kill the
[51:21] influence of the people godly people
[51:25] Godly men and women that God has placed
[51:29] in your life and in my life to see us
[51:33] through to the
[51:36] end so it sounds good and everything but
[51:41] now we have to be
[51:43] spiritual and just say not just say well
[51:45] I agree with that and that is true but
[51:48] now we need to be spiritual and have our
[51:50] spiritual thinking caps on that whenever
[51:53] you hear someone that's trying to kill
[51:55] an influence of somebody else within the
[51:58] church we should know that that spirit
[52:00] is of the wrong kind of spirit it is not
[52:03] the spirit of Christ um we should hold
[52:06] that person and that Spirit accountable
[52:09] that's
[52:12] right
[52:15] Hallelujah well how do you hold a person
[52:18] accountable you take him to the side you
[52:21] say my brother my sister do you realize
[52:24] what you're doing do you realize this is
[52:27] a seed of Discord do you realize what
[52:29] you're planting here in my heart and in
[52:32] everybody else's heart that wants to
[52:34] listen to what you're trying to say
[52:36] you're going to you're going to take the
[52:38] influence of the man of God and you're
[52:41] going to kill it it's not against the
[52:43] man but it's against God Amen because
[52:47] Satan is against God and that's that's
[52:50] what he wants if he can get you to get
[52:53] your uh confidence out of the manil
[52:57] your confidence will soon leave God it's
[53:00] true so now we say Hey brother you know
[53:04] what you're doing is wrong right you
[53:06] know what you're saying here uh you
[53:08] shouldn't be saying it you know you
[53:10] ought to repent and go to that person
[53:12] and say that you're sorry I think if we
[53:15] held each other accountable in a very
[53:18] nice Christian fashion of course
[53:21] amen we don't want to be disagreeable
[53:23] with anybody we want to kill them with
[53:25] love
[53:27] am but say hey hey hey wait a second
[53:30] you're way out left field here let's
[53:32] bring it back let's talk this over like
[53:35] real men let's talk this over like
[53:37] Brethren like like sisters what what are
[53:41] you trying to do here do you realizes oh
[53:43] no I didn't even realize it yeah repent
[53:47] and make it
[53:49] right it's amazing my brother and my
[53:53] sister
[53:55] repentance I really want to preach on
[53:57] repentance sometime true repentance even
[54:01] for a Believer not for this not for the
[54:04] sinner that that comes in and repents
[54:06] and they give their heart to Christ and
[54:08] we all joy no no no you know that uh
[54:11] there be times there when you look at
[54:14] Ahab for instance and God was bringing
[54:17] the judgments upon Ahab through the word
[54:19] of Elijah that Ahab he went oh my my and
[54:23] he he he he he he repented and put
[54:26] sackcloth upon himself and he tore his
[54:28] clothes and he said oh God I I'm sorry I
[54:31] I Repent of what I done I Repent of my
[54:35] works I I
[54:36] repent and what did God tell Elijah to
[54:39] do tell him is not going to come in his
[54:42] day because he repented towards me but
[54:45] it'll be upon his family when I bring
[54:47] these things to pass you know how you
[54:50] get the curse of God off your life you
[54:53] don't have the joy that you used to have
[54:55] you don't have the pray that you used to
[54:57] have you don't have the love for God's
[54:59] people that you used to have there's one
[55:01] thing that'll fix it that's true
[55:05] repentance you repent of whatever it is
[55:08] in your heart let me tell you you'll
[55:10] feel the sweet presence of God come just
[55:13] like just like brother brandham you
[55:15] remember brother brandham said one time
[55:17] uh God you owe me an answer you remember
[55:21] because God didn't give him the answer
[55:23] to the vision or whatever it was and he
[55:25] said my the spirit of God he grieved the
[55:28] Holy Spirit and he walked
[55:31] alone there was no Visions there was no
[55:34] there was no the Lord wasn't close by
[55:36] him he didn't feel his presence until
[55:39] finally he came to a place and he said
[55:41] father I'm sorry you don't owe me
[55:45] nothing amen and all of a sudden what
[55:48] happened the presence of God was with
[55:51] brother brandham one more time thank you
[55:53] Lord why because he repented
[55:57] you remember the time that brother
[55:59] Brandon was under so much pressure in
[56:01] his life the IRS was chasing him
[56:04] down he was being attacked by church and
[56:07] by state doors were closing on him and
[56:10] everything and people were saying all
[56:12] kinds of things about him and about his
[56:14] ministry and he he was getting pressured
[56:17] from all over the place and here he was
[56:19] and the phone rang and sister M said uh
[56:22] I I believe it was a lawyer or the IRS
[56:24] or whoever it was and they're coming
[56:26] after them for signing all these checks
[56:28] and they're saying you got to pay back
[56:29] taxes and all these checks and all these
[56:31] offerings that we've been given you in
[56:33] your
[56:34] name wow what a pressure have you ever
[56:37] been pressured by money before like that
[56:40] huh feel like you're absolutely drowning
[56:42] there he was how am I going to pay this
[56:44] back uh I didn't spend any of this money
[56:48] this money was never mind I I didn't do
[56:51] anything with it but yet he was being
[56:54] attacked by the state
[56:57] he got under so much pressure he said ma
[57:00] tell him I'm not
[57:02] in and here he went and he stepped
[57:04] outside the door and she took the
[57:07] call for us hey that's a daily thing
[57:10] yeah I'm not
[57:13] here you miss a call yeah I'm I'm I'm
[57:17] busy we don't answer it we do something
[57:21] else make up some excuse we lie pretty
[57:24] much oh I didn't hear you what did you
[57:30] say but here he was he had such a walk
[57:33] with God and he steps outside and he
[57:35] steps back in and technically he wasn't
[57:38] in but yet it was the reason behind he
[57:41] did it was wrong the motive was wrong
[57:43] right and so all of a sudden somebody
[57:45] comes for prayer and brings their their
[57:47] little child I believe it was and
[57:48] brought it in he went to pray for him
[57:49] there was a dark sheet that came down he
[57:52] he couldn't pray for the person why
[57:53] because he had done wrong but when he
[57:56] made it right what happened he prayed
[57:59] for that same person and the little kid
[58:02] got well again repentance works wonders
[58:05] in our lives repentance brings us back
[58:08] into the very presence of God again be
[58:11] quick to repent and don't let the sun go
[58:14] down in your wrath not just with your
[58:17] wife not just with your husband but with
[58:19] God
[58:21] Almighty everybody said
[58:24] am Hallelujah
[58:29] so what does what does what does uh
[58:31] Jezebel want to do Jezebel wants to kill
[58:34] the influence but not only kill the
[58:36] influence she wants to erect altars
[58:38] within our lives that we serve other
[58:40] things instead of serving God erects
[58:43] money in our lives an ability to make
[58:45] money erects Sports and music and movies
[58:48] and all these different things and
[58:49] before we realize it we are worshiping
[58:52] the altars of liosia instead of having
[58:57] uh uh a true worship with God in our
[59:01] lives amen he just doesn't want to kill
[59:05] the influence but he wants to change the
[59:08] influence and erect other things in your
[59:10] life be aware of the tactics of this
[59:14] Jezebel
[59:17] spirit but there was an Elijah in that
[59:20] day who not only stood against the
[59:23] system of that day who didn't only erect
[59:26] an altar uh back to where the people
[59:29] would worship God in spirit and in truth
[59:32] again but that Prophet Elijah he had a
[59:35] mount carel experience and after he had
[59:39] rebuilt the altar of God what did he do
[59:41] he he slayed all those prophets all
[59:44] those false prophets of baale that were
[59:46] prophesying and calling upon their God
[59:49] and cutting themselves and every and and
[59:51] all of those different things he took
[59:53] them all over to the edge of the
[59:54] mountain and he slayed them all and
[59:55] kicked them over the edge of the Hill
[59:58] that's what the spirit of Elijah does to
[59:59] the spirit of Jezebel amen he defeats it
[1:00:03] Elijah is not overcome by Jezebel but
[1:00:07] Jezebel is overcome by the word of
[1:00:10] Elijah oh Hallelujah that ought to that
[1:00:14] ought to make you say Amen because you
[1:00:17] have a
[1:00:18] relationship with the Elijah's
[1:00:21] spirit and if he overcome that Spirit
[1:00:24] that'll mean that we will also overcome
[1:00:27] that spirit in this day because we have
[1:00:30] had a spirit of Elijah what did he come
[1:00:32] to do he he come to rebuild the stones
[1:00:35] the altars that was all broken down and
[1:00:37] once he rebuilt the altars what did he
[1:00:40] do he was a oneman army amen took the
[1:00:43] sword of the word he cut this devil's
[1:00:46] head off this denominational head off
[1:00:48] cut this one off why cuz he was Paving
[1:00:51] away for Elisha amen
[1:00:56] Elijah paved the way for Elisha
[1:01:02] amen the same mantle and the same stick
[1:01:05] that was used to cross the Jordan River
[1:01:08] by Elijah was the same one that was used
[1:01:12] by Elisha to cross back over it again
[1:01:15] God is still the same we can use this
[1:01:18] same word to cross back and forward over
[1:01:22] Jordan as many times as we want why
[1:01:25] because the word does not change and the
[1:01:27] mantle has not lost any power that it
[1:01:30] once had that's
[1:01:32] right
[1:01:38] Hallelujah this
[1:01:40] Vineyard it's it's a very interesting
[1:01:43] story it belonged to naboth and you know
[1:01:46] it really meant something to him you
[1:01:49] know there's a law written within the
[1:01:52] word and it's it's the law of
[1:01:54] inheritance and within this law it it
[1:01:57] says that if somebody offers you uh you
[1:02:00] know the money that what it's worth and
[1:02:02] you take it you don't have to give it
[1:02:04] back it the person paid what it was
[1:02:07] worth or if they give you something
[1:02:09] better Ahab in In fairness was trying to
[1:02:13] follow the law of
[1:02:15] inheritance and that's why Ahab was so
[1:02:18] sorrowful because when naboth wouldn't
[1:02:21] give him it he he understood hey my
[1:02:23] hands are tied man there's not nothing I
[1:02:26] can do about this if this is the the the
[1:02:29] law of inheritance hey if he won't give
[1:02:31] it to me for what it's worth he won't
[1:02:33] give it to me for something better it's
[1:02:35] his I can't do anything about
[1:02:37] it but Jezebel had other plans that's
[1:02:41] right but this this this Vineyard it
[1:02:44] really meant something to him why did it
[1:02:47] mean so much to
[1:02:49] naboth because he understood that it
[1:02:51] wasn't just his it was passed down it
[1:02:55] was a
[1:02:57] multi-generational uh inheritance that
[1:02:59] was inherited to him through family it
[1:03:03] was inherited to him through a
[1:03:06] bloodline and he understood the
[1:03:08] importance of the inheritance through
[1:03:10] bloodline that this means something to
[1:03:13] me this belongs to me and not only does
[1:03:17] it belong to me but it belongs to my
[1:03:19] children it belongs to my children's
[1:03:22] children it it's a promise that's been
[1:03:24] left of me by Jehovah God for my family
[1:03:28] and I'm not giving it up understand you
[1:03:31] don't need to give up on your family
[1:03:33] members because it is a promise onto you
[1:03:36] if you would just hold them up in prayer
[1:03:38] and say father I don't know when but I
[1:03:41] know you can and I'm believing for it
[1:03:43] Lord amen but Satan wants you to to let
[1:03:48] go of the promises of God he wants you
[1:03:50] to let go of the inheritance of our
[1:03:53] children uh the promise of our children
[1:03:56] serving God but nabal said not
[1:03:59] so I have a promise I have an
[1:04:03] inheritance that has been paid for by
[1:04:06] Blood hallelujah it's been passed down
[1:04:09] through my bloodline and I am not
[1:04:11] letting go I don't care what you offer
[1:04:14] me I don't care what you say I don't
[1:04:17] care what you do it is mine amen
[1:04:20] somebody say mine
[1:04:23] mine belongs to you that's right don't
[1:04:26] give it
[1:04:30] up that's why the Bible says here in 2
[1:04:34] Peter
[1:04:35] 1:10 wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:04:38] diligence to make your calling an
[1:04:40] election sure for if you do these things
[1:04:43] you shall never fall the word diligence
[1:04:46] it means speed eagerness and earnestness
[1:04:51] a care or haste in other words the
[1:04:55] script RT is telling us to be to be
[1:04:57] quick the need to be quick the need to
[1:05:01] be eager to have a revelation to
[1:05:04] understand that to make your calling an
[1:05:06] election sure because if you don't make
[1:05:09] your calling an election sure you can't
[1:05:12] rightly ask what belongs to you as a son
[1:05:15] or daughter of God if you're not quick
[1:05:18] and diligent and making haste and saying
[1:05:21] I know I've had an experience with God I
[1:05:23] know I'm a son or daughter of God I I
[1:05:25] know these things if we're not quickly
[1:05:28] and and knowing it from the bottom of
[1:05:30] our heart Satan can plant doubt in our
[1:05:32] minds and when doubt and unbelief is in
[1:05:35] the heart of a person there's absolutely
[1:05:38] no way for us to grasp by faith our
[1:05:42] inheritance and promises that God has
[1:05:46] left to us
[1:05:47] amen make haste do it
[1:05:51] quickly do it be eager about it seek it
[1:05:54] diligently
[1:05:56] go after it and understand that if if
[1:05:59] you're a son or a daughter of God there
[1:06:02] is a book that is full of great and
[1:06:04] precious promises there has been an
[1:06:06] inheritance that has been paid for us by
[1:06:09] the blood of Jesus Christ that has been
[1:06:11] left to us for us to grasp and for us to
[1:06:14] handle but the longer we doubt about who
[1:06:16] we are and where we came from and where
[1:06:19] we're going the harder it is for us as
[1:06:23] Believers to say that promises is
[1:06:27] mine that part of the inheritance within
[1:06:29] the word belongs to me and I'm going to
[1:06:32] take it
[1:06:38] amen second Peter 1: 2 through four
[1:06:43] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:06:44] through the knowledge of God and of
[1:06:46] Jesus Christ of Jesus our lord according
[1:06:49] as his divine power has given unto us
[1:06:52] all things somebody say all things he's
[1:06:55] given to you all things you don't have
[1:06:56] to worry about a single thing why
[1:06:59] because he's given to you all things
[1:07:01] that pertain onto life onto this natural
[1:07:05] life he has already given onto you all
[1:07:08] things that casts out all the fear that
[1:07:11] casts out all the doubt it doesn't
[1:07:13] matter what happens what comes or goes
[1:07:15] why because he has already given unto me
[1:07:18] by a promise all things pertaining to
[1:07:22] this life and godliness thank you Lord
[1:07:27] so whether it's the natural things or
[1:07:29] whether it's the spiritual things God
[1:07:32] has already provided it for
[1:07:36] us that by these by what by these great
[1:07:40] and precious promis oh through the
[1:07:42] knowledge of him that has called us to
[1:07:43] the glory and virtue verse four whereby
[1:07:46] are given unto us exceeding great and
[1:07:50] precious promises that by these you
[1:07:53] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:07:58] so how are we partakers of the divine
[1:08:00] nature through the promises of God thank
[1:08:05] you Lord without the promises of God
[1:08:08] what written within this word for you
[1:08:10] and I as Believers there is no way for
[1:08:13] us to be a part of his divine nature but
[1:08:17] because of the promises because of these
[1:08:20] precious and great promises guess what
[1:08:24] now we can be partakers
[1:08:26] of his divine nature amen having escaped
[1:08:30] the corruption that is in the world
[1:08:32] through
[1:08:33] lust it's only through the promises of
[1:08:36] God that we can be partakers of the
[1:08:38] divine nature of God and to believe that
[1:08:41] those promises are for you as an
[1:08:44] individual you must know who you are in
[1:08:46] Christ as a son or daughter of
[1:08:49] God have you ever seen somebody that
[1:08:53] doesn't know who they are
[1:08:56] who am
[1:08:57] I where did I come
[1:08:59] from what am I doing here where am I
[1:09:03] going that's most college kids did you
[1:09:06] know
[1:09:07] that what am I going to do I don't know
[1:09:10] I'll go to this class no I won't I'll go
[1:09:13] to this one what
[1:09:15] what what am I what what am I going to
[1:09:17] do for a POS I don't know what you're
[1:09:19] going to do for
[1:09:21] education or for a job you know what the
[1:09:23] best thing to do for a job is do
[1:09:25] something you
[1:09:27] enjoy brother Robert McGary told me that
[1:09:30] probably 16 years
[1:09:32] ago and it's a good piece of advice
[1:09:34] brother Robert he said find something
[1:09:37] you enjoy and do it and so here I
[1:09:42] am where who am I
[1:09:45] though where did I come from where am I
[1:09:49] going what am I doing a person who
[1:09:53] doesn't know you know what they do they
[1:09:56] just walk in
[1:09:57] circles I don't know I don't know who I
[1:10:01] am I I I don't know what's the purpose
[1:10:04] of
[1:10:05] life what's the purpose of
[1:10:08] this do we just are we just born and we
[1:10:12] eat and we live and we try to enjoy and
[1:10:15] and then we die and I don't know what
[1:10:17] happens after that I I I don't know a
[1:10:21] person who doesn't know they don't
[1:10:23] know they have no leadership they have
[1:10:27] no Direction they uh you could tell them
[1:10:30] you know you could tell a person that
[1:10:31] they're a son or daughter of God until
[1:10:33] you're blue in the
[1:10:35] face until it drops down
[1:10:38] here they ain't ever going to believe
[1:10:41] it you can't make somebody believe that
[1:10:44] they're a son or a daughter of God do
[1:10:46] you know why because there's too much
[1:10:48] doubt in their hearts and when there's
[1:10:51] too much doubt and unbelief in the heart
[1:10:53] of a person it's hard hard for them to
[1:10:56] see the things of God and how they're
[1:10:59] really seeing when faith and unbelief is
[1:11:03] in the heart the person looks to The
[1:11:06] Faults and the failures rather than to
[1:11:08] the promise the person looks to what
[1:11:11] they're doing wrong rather than what God
[1:11:14] has already done for
[1:11:16] them but a True Believer understands
[1:11:20] yeah I was born in sin and shaped in
[1:11:22] iniquity and I have so many issues but
[1:11:26] by the grace of God I am here and by the
[1:11:29] grace of God I am a son I am a daughter
[1:11:32] of God and and I'm walking by faith
[1:11:34] through the grace of Jesus Christ
[1:11:37] hallelujah thank you Lord people can sit
[1:11:40] in a church chair or a church pew and
[1:11:44] not know who they are and die in their
[1:11:46] chair spiritually
[1:11:48] speaking they can go for years and and
[1:11:51] hear the sermons and feel the presence
[1:11:54] of God and feel the anointing of God and
[1:11:56] and understand scriptural uh principles
[1:11:59] and doctrines but yet within their
[1:12:01] hearts there's something missing there's
[1:12:04] too much unbelief and when God tries to
[1:12:07] penetrate the heart it's just so
[1:12:09] hardened that he can't get
[1:12:12] through why because they don't know who
[1:12:16] they are am but when you know who you
[1:12:19] are in Christ
[1:12:21] Jesus and you have made your calling an
[1:12:24] an elect
[1:12:26] sure and you understand the ways of God
[1:12:30] and you understand that just because I'm
[1:12:32] having a hard time it doesn't mean that
[1:12:35] I'm not a seed of God just because I'm
[1:12:37] troubled in my spirit it doesn't mean
[1:12:40] that I am not a son or a daughter of God
[1:12:43] but a son or a daughter of God when
[1:12:45] they're challenged and troubled they say
[1:12:48] Father Here I Am I need you they call
[1:12:53] out to God and that's what he really
[1:12:55] wants amen they don't die in their chair
[1:12:59] going to church but they revive through
[1:13:02] the tribulations why because you know
[1:13:05] what it does tribulation it brings us
[1:13:08] back it softens our
[1:13:11] hearts after you get over the
[1:13:13] hardness after you get over you know
[1:13:16] that's why a lot of people that are
[1:13:18] hard-headed
[1:13:20] like
[1:13:21] myself takes a while and God will beat
[1:13:25] on us and beat on us and you'll feel
[1:13:28] troubled and you'll feel oh my my
[1:13:31] goodness this is brutal and but you just
[1:13:34] put your head down and you just keep
[1:13:36] going until finally you get father I
[1:13:38] have had enough of this thing please
[1:13:41] forgive me I'm sorry if I done something
[1:13:43] wrong and you begin to make things right
[1:13:45] there's other people man they are just
[1:13:46] quick to it father I don't want to deal
[1:13:48] with this anymore take it away from me
[1:13:51] that's how we want to be
[1:13:55] but when you realize who you are and The
[1:13:59] Inheritance that is left to you as a son
[1:14:02] or daughter of God the floods will
[1:14:06] come but they won't affect you as they
[1:14:09] would with somebody that doesn't know
[1:14:11] who they are the fire will burn but it
[1:14:15] won't affect you as it would affect
[1:14:16] somebody who doesn't know who you are
[1:14:19] why because we
[1:14:21] realize that it's for our greater good
[1:14:25] amen do you see the comparison do you
[1:14:28] see the difference do you see the
[1:14:30] importance for us to to understand these
[1:14:33] things and say wow I understand it I'm
[1:14:37] making diligent my calling and my
[1:14:39] election why because I know if I know
[1:14:42] who I am I can claim what rightfully
[1:14:44] belongs to me that's
[1:14:49] right the inheritance that lays within
[1:14:52] you
[1:14:55] within the siing of God is greater than
[1:14:58] the inheritance that your family member
[1:15:00] has left you in the
[1:15:02] flesh The Inheritance that lays within
[1:15:06] you of eternal life is greater than the

[1:22:01] knocking at my heart and saying William

[1:22:05] before the foundation of the world to
[1:22:06] preach the gospel I have an inheritance
[1:22:09] an inheritance of eternal life now God
[1:22:13] sent Jesus to make that inheritance real
[1:22:17] to me amen so though the promise was
[1:22:20] there and though there was an
[1:22:22] inheritance before the foundation of the
[1:22:24] the world until it was known by
[1:22:27] Revelation from God you can't claim your
[1:22:32] inheritance because there was nothing I
[1:22:35] could do to inherit inherit it it was
[1:22:39] black it was Val it was blank it was
[1:22:41] valid there's nothing I could do but in
[1:22:44] the fullness of time God sent his own in
[1:22:48] his own good time Jesus the lamb slain
[1:22:52] from the foundation of the world his
[1:22:53] blood was shed that I might go to my
[1:22:56] inheritance to be what what inheritance
[1:22:59] you want to know what your inheritance
[1:23:01] is the sunship to be a Son of God
[1:23:07] hallelujah you see brother Stephen
[1:23:09] that's too simple that's what your
[1:23:11] inheritance is is to be a Son of God not
[1:23:15] just here in this Earth but when we
[1:23:17] cross over and we get into that Heavenly
[1:23:20] Jerusalem and there's no more sin
[1:23:22] sickness or shame
[1:23:24] your inheritance is to be a son or a
[1:23:28] daughter of God thank you Lord your
[1:23:31] inheritance is made known to you by
[1:23:34] revelation of the Holy Spirit your
[1:23:37] inheritance doesn't start when you get
[1:23:39] across the other side but your
[1:23:41] inheritance starts right here right now
[1:23:45] loud seea evening Life Fellowship as you
[1:23:49] go about your daily business your
[1:23:51] inheritance starts now you don't have to
[1:23:54] wait wait for it it's not something
[1:23:56] that's off in the future that you're
[1:23:58] trying to reach for no it's right here
[1:24:00] written within the word of God praise
[1:24:02] the
[1:24:03] Lord praise the
[1:24:05] Lord but it's given to
[1:24:08] you in
[1:24:10] parts so when God has given to you your
[1:24:14] inheritance he gives he doesn't give it
[1:24:17] to you all at once he once you're sealed
[1:24:19] of God with the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:22] Ghost he just doesn't take you out of
[1:24:23] here and and and and and that's it and
[1:24:26] you've got no more trials or trip no he
[1:24:29] doesn't give it to you all at once but
[1:24:31] he gives it to you in Parts in little
[1:24:35] pieces at the very beginning he reveals
[1:24:38] himself to you as Jehovah savior he
[1:24:42] reveals to you your inheritance in Jesus
[1:24:45] Christ to be a son or a daughter of God
[1:24:48] and as you go through life's journey he
[1:24:51] reveals and he gives to you a little bit
[1:24:53] more of your inheritance and he reveals
[1:24:56] himself as Jehovah
[1:24:58] nessi he reveals himself to you as
[1:25:02] Jehovah jarra I will provide all your
[1:25:05] needs what is it it's a piece of your
[1:25:08] inheritance that he's giving onto you a
[1:25:11] little piece of himself of Jehovah Nissi
[1:25:14] and Jehovah Rafa and Jehovah Shalom and
[1:25:17] and and and all these different great
[1:25:19] attributes of God he doesn't give it to
[1:25:21] you all at once but he gives it to you
[1:25:25] as is needed
[1:25:28] amen he doesn't reveal it all at once
[1:25:31] because you can't handle it you can't
[1:25:34] understand it all at
[1:25:35] once so at an appointed time sir he
[1:25:40] reveals himself and he gives you this
[1:25:43] piece of your inheritance at an
[1:25:45] appointed time he gives you this piece
[1:25:48] of your inheritance at an appointed time
[1:25:50] when you're sick and body he says you're
[1:25:53] in need of a he Healing Touch in your
[1:25:55] body here I am Jehovah
[1:25:59] Nessie I Am The God Who heals all of
[1:26:02] your diseases at God's appointed time
[1:26:06] too much of the time we are caught up
[1:26:08] with our timing and when is it going to
[1:26:11] happen but if God had an appointed time
[1:26:14] with you for salvation he has
[1:26:16] appointments made out for you along your
[1:26:20] journey whether it's a provider for this
[1:26:23] whether it's a healing in the body
[1:26:24] whether you need a paycheck whether you
[1:26:26] need this whether you need comforted
[1:26:29] whatever it may be at an appointed time
[1:26:31] in your life's journey amen he says here
[1:26:35] look it here's here's a piece of your
[1:26:38] inheritance I'm going to give it to you
[1:26:41] this is your appointment this is your
[1:26:43] time take it and eat it and receive it
[1:26:47] here it is it's for you and he never
[1:26:50] stops giving his inheritance to his
[1:26:53] children because guess what my cousins
[1:26:56] they probably done spent all that money
[1:26:58] already amen I got a blank checkbook man
[1:27:03] Hallelujah and I can
[1:27:06] sign and it's already been sealed and
[1:27:09] it's already been signed by the pair in
[1:27:12] the blood of Jesus Christ and I can take
[1:27:15] that thing and I can write whatever I
[1:27:17] want on it at my appointed time right
[1:27:20] why because it's my inheritance and it
[1:27:24] belongs to me thank you Lord hallelujah
[1:27:29] I want you to know never forget you know
[1:27:31] this already God always keeps his
[1:27:35] appointments he's never too early he's
[1:27:38] never too late but he is an ontime
[1:27:42] God and so we find out that a lot of our
[1:27:45] prayers is God help me and God do this
[1:27:47] for me and and God and help me and God
[1:27:50] God God but as we mature in our
[1:27:52] Christian walk now our prayer changes to
[1:27:55] where it says now we are touched by the
[1:27:57] feelings of the infirmities of the other
[1:28:00] people within the assembly and that when
[1:28:02] one person hurts the rest of the body
[1:28:05] hurts and our prayer now changes from
[1:28:08] praying for ourselves to father I pray
[1:28:11] for that other person father I pray for
[1:28:13] that person's child father I pray for
[1:28:15] that person's marriage I pray for
[1:28:17] whatever that person is going through
[1:28:19] Lord and and I ask father that you would
[1:28:22] have an appointment with them amen
[1:28:25] amen when you begin to pray for other
[1:28:28] people over yourself it shows maturity
[1:28:31] in your Christian walk that's
[1:28:34] right Hallelujah just like Abraham stood
[1:28:37] in the gap for lot just like Moses when
[1:28:40] he stood in the Gap and and he said he
[1:28:42] said Lord just take me don't take the
[1:28:44] children of don't take the children it's
[1:28:46] not them Lord let me let me stand in the
[1:28:48] gap for them Father what was it it was a
[1:28:52] sign of maturity
[1:28:55] of putting other people's needs before
[1:28:57] our very own needs us Lord that's the
[1:29:00] sign of a mature Christian in the body
[1:29:03] of Christ
