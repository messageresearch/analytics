you amen let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father I stand here today Lord just a vessel father to have you speak through and Lord if we can get the people to believe all things are possible that's what your Prophet has taught us if we can see our position in your word Lord all things are possible and this morning my father that I'd ask that you come and you do the speaking Lord you see in my study you can see Lord I I've been asking you Lord that you would come in a special way this morning and in the office Lord and while we sang the songs of praise this morning you've come and you've just been anointing your people and so I thank you Lord for that this morning father I pray now Lord that you would take this word and would you break it before your people Lord would you open our eyes to see may you give us inspiration today to receive Lord may it not just be hearing from flesh and blood but Lord may it be hearing Lord From The Throne of almighty God and father I just stand a servant here asking that you would take this word that we've already heard nothing's new Lord the prophet God brought it to us and we're going to say what he said we're we're going to speak it Lord we're going to live it we're going to trust in you today would you God just take this now and open our hearts to be hearers of your word I pray father for those that are afflicted in body I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that they would reach and Touch the Hem of your garment this morning and that they would be healed Lord by the spoken word we can be healed by the preaching of the word we can be healed this morning and so father We Believe with all our hearts that you were wounded for our transgressions and Brew is Lord for our iniquities and by your stripes Lord this morning we can be healed in our bodies Lord our Spirits can be healed this morning Father you can touch the Inner Man Lord that we can grow farther in you this morning we hold to the altar of God this morning knowing that you will do the speaking and this we give you thanks We Believe Lord with all of our heart in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen why don't you turn in your Bibles with me to Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 and we just want to read one scripture verse here in Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and then we will also read the first portion of Isaiah chapter 49 and verse 1 in just a moment amen I have some slides on the screen this morning and amen I trust that that will help you this morning to see exactly what the prophet has said what the scriptures have said we want to identify with that this morning Genesis chapter 2 verse 7. and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life and Man became a living soul the Lord blessed the reading of this word we can take our seats this morning I'd like to speak to you this morning on a little fodder as I was meditating in my study I desired that God would encourage us I had a desire that God would bring a positive message of the word to us this morning we are the Bride of Jesus Christ now some of you don't know who I am but I've been raised in this message and I've loved the Lord since I was a little boy but I want to share to you this morning that that we need to be a people that are formed we are filled but my thought this morning is that we need to be a functioning bride of Jesus Christ and we read in our text this morning that the Lord God he formed he formed man from the dust of the ground and he he breathed the breath of life into him into his nostrils he breathed eternal life inside of him and he became a living soul a soul that cannot die the prophet of God would say or he became a functioning living soul and as we begin to unpack this thought the brother Brad will say we we want to get you know a little honey right up to the elbows we we want to just to immerse ourselves in what God has for us Isaiah in Isaiah 41 verse 1. he speaks an under inspiration and he writes he says the Lord hath called me from the womb and from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name from the beginning of time from the foundation of the world as you've heard it many times but as I encourage you again before the foundation of the world God has called us to be a people God has chosen us for this time to be a bride we're not looking to yesteryears or in a glare of another time but we're looking at what God in this present time has appointed us to be and we must understand and must grasp it bring it to our bosoms begin to believe with all of our hearts that there is an importance for our becoming there is an importance of why we are here today in 2023. you know friends it's no matter how instant insignificant we all feel and I I want to tell you and I want to be personal to you today sometimes we very feel very insignificant sometimes in our goings of our life and the things that we we do we find ourselves in faults and we find ourselves in failures and but I want to tell you today that God is taking a picture of you from your the beginning of your time and he sees the ending of your time the in-betweens that we go through it's the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses us from all unrighteousness and and all sins and all our afflictions and so we have been formed for this season he knew our name and we often sing that song He Knows My Name he's recorded my name not only in The Book of Life when we were all born but it's most important that we recognize that our names have been put on the Lamb's Book of Life and that our lives are covered this morning by the sprinkling of the almighty God the power of the blood and so he knows her names he knows us he knows our thoughts he knows our feelings he knows every expression that we have in our lives brother Branham in this message in 1951 in faith is the substance he says and men are regenerated made a new person sealed into the kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit the life of Christ's pressed into them and I want to underline that I I want that to bring in bold the life of God pressed Into You and I all their drinking and immoral habits and everything go out the love of God is like a notary republic takes a seal and presses it into the inscription of the seal it's it presses in the paper over the signature thank you Lord oh my and when Christ signs your name on The Book of Life and the Holy Spirit presses it in there until the Life of Christ is formed in you the prophet of God would say hallelujah becomes deity this morning I think we can rejoice your name has been written on the Lamb's Book of Life deity has been pressed into your very being the prophet of God would say we are called Messiahs or you would say that we are Gods with a small G which means that we are our sons and daughters of God with the living elements up gone on the inside of Us Praise His Name in first John in our scripture reading in first John chapter 3 verse 2. he says now I beloved now are we the sons of God can you understand can you feel that pulsation within your heart to say I am a son or a daughter of God no matter your test no matter the trial the struggle you went to this week and we have gone through some struggles this week no doubt when you are painting and you were placing carpet in this room there was brother Amos there was some struggle some some humanness that came out but by the grace of God God's not looking at our humanness this morning he's not looking at your failures this morning he's looking at a representative of himself a representation of his very Life In You and I now we have become Sons and Daughters of Gods and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is I want to tell you this morning we have a scene appearing of his coming he has spoke to us today in this hour he spoke to us by a prophet and we have seen his coming spiritually and we will see him but now we are called to be Sons and Daughters of God the prophet God would mention to us and tell us many times that you know we we often look at the Times past or the at the past things that are happening or we look to the time of the future but the prophet of God tells us we need to look to the present we need to see what's happening right here right now and in this season and I've come to you this morning with my heart filled with God's love to tell you now you are Sons now you are Daughters of God greater than Solomon is in our midst this morning he has called us this morning to walk in his fulfillment of his word now we are individuals and we've been called to walk with God as individuals and brother Brian would tell us God has got no grandchildren you can't come to to God by some other way you can't come on the expressions of brother Ron Peterson or or my pastor John Andy's or any other minister or grandfather or any type you have to come has an individual before God and as we come as individuals speak for God we recognize that we are part of a great big picture God has got a spiritual body that we call the bride and we have been formed and taken from his side from every nation every country every money of speaking of of language God has called the people to be taken to be formed to be brought forth and an hour to be born of his bone flesh of his flesh the body of Christ is not male it's not female but it's called The Bride each one United in this body I want to tell you it's a body like his own glorious body a body that's formed in his very own image when you walk in the markets when you go to your places of jobs this morning I want to tell you that you are the image of God you are speaking to the people to the world out that Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever it's your life that is thundering out loud we are formed in this image of God in First Corinthians chapter 12 Paul the Apostle in verse 12 he begins to speak about this body and he says for as the body is what and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one spirit we are baptized into one body whether we be jew or Gentile whether it be Bond or free and have been all made to drink in one spirit for the body is not one member but many and then in verse 15 and for the sake of time we won't read it but through 15-26 he begins to describe that you may be will you be the foot or you might be the hand or you might be the eye or the lip or whatever you might be but you ought to work in that in that placing that God has put you in we can't all operate in the same token in the same way God's got a great economy we can't all be beautiful singers like we've heard this morning that was some beautiful worship unto the Lord but we can't all be singers we can all be deacons or preachers God is calling women to be mothers and and men and women to be Witnesses and to go forth and preach the gospel we all have a job to do in The Bride of Jesus Christ we have been formed hands and feet and eyes and so on to do exactly the work of Almighty Mighty God verse 27 we would read now ye are the body of Christ now it is and members in particular you've got a job to do I want to encourage you this morning you've got a job to do go into the world be a witness I'm encouraging this morning to go find that last seed you are all ministers maybe not fightful Ministry but we all have a Ministry to speak in particular what God has for us in the message expectation in 1951 God has always had a Remnant somewhere and he's got a Remnant tonight don't you believe that I say Amen now tonight A remnants are composed of his body his spiritual body here on the earth baptized people into the body making us the body of Christ I want to underline that word baptized because we have been fully baptized or fully immersed or we have plunged fully head long and fully persuaded to be a a part of his body part of his flesh we give ourselves completely to him can you can you walk down memory lane with me just for a moment when God called you none of us was looking we were looking for God but he was looking for us and when he called us and and he poured his love we'll talk about that in just a moment but when he poured his love upon us we couldn't help but love back and you can't serve God half-heartedly you can't live on one side of the fence to the other you have to be a baptized people uh fully immersed people a people plunged into the the Fountain of Life you need to be fully persuaded that he's the Conqueror the captain the Creator we are formed to be the body of Christ you know I look in the scriptures and we look at Jeremiah when the Lord spoke to Jeremiah over and he said come on over Jeremiah and I want you to go to The Potter's House how many can remember that and so Jeremiah Jeremiah under inspiration he goes to the power of Potter's House and sure enough the Potter he was there and he was working on the Wheel and as we watched Jeremiah speak he sees the pottery he's spinning the clay he's making a vessel and as he's spinning this vessel in the clay we notice that there are some marred pieces some some broken places some some spots that would not be good in a beautiful vessel and I I want you to take a very close notice that as the Potter is working on the clay he never tosses the clear way now this is making me Rejoice I've been I'm overwhelmed within my being because he never tossed me away even when I'm a Son of God and find myself in some time human failure because this flesh is not saved it is my worst enemy but although I find some Mars that are there within the vessel the Potter never tosses it away he merely removes that Mar and begins to spit Hallelujah he begins to move actually again he begins to transform by the word of God and gives us a renewing of our mind gives us Christ's nights her to process France when you're born into the spirit of God you don't aren't born in a mature you're born in as a babe into the economy of God and there are times where you fall there's times where there's failures but God is faithful to take those things front of our lives and keep molding on our being I think many times we can take comfort in the scripture verse that would tell us that there is therefore now no condemnation can you feel those expressions of life in your being from the word of God this is not me speaking an emotional thought to you this morning this is the word of God speaking from my lips down to the very depths of your soul there is that for now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after this flesh but after the spirit you're longing Lord Jesus reveal more I'm after your spirit Lord Heavenly Father then begins to give us eyes of Revelation to see and ears to hear what the spirit is saying in this time in the season when I listen to The Prophet's message I'm hearing the voice of God speaking to me personally it might be the voice of William Branham but there's a voice behind the voice and that voice is speaking to the depths of my soul saying to me if we can hear his voice and not Harden our hearts we can be a functioning people and Christ revealed in his word in 65. in the last days when the evening light brings begins to shine eyes will begin become open stop there just for a moment because I'm seeing people in this assembly today at a time of evening light neither light or nor Darkness a time where it's hazy mistake there is a people that have eyes to see when the prophet of God was drawing those moons and he was keeping the light for every age and the angel of the Lord spoke to him and he was telling him to draw this Aegis total darkness the prophet of God saw you and I in this time with that word and tucked in our hearts that were functional Believers functional bride and he said I drew a little bit of light I put a little light in there because there was a bride for a season in a time where it would be neither not neither dark nor light that there would be a people that would have eyes that become open and you will see where you're going then the body is already formed standing upon its feet taking motion now as you can see my thoughts this morning about a a functional bride a moving bride I believe God wants us to have that understanding today that we are to take motion we are to begin to move by the spirit of God now the spirit of God has always been moving but God is reaffirming to us take another step we build the fire of the prophet of God says here today but don't live on the old fire let's move up the road and build another fire and so we need to take motion moving by the Holy Spirit the same one that moved upon the prophets and wrote the Bible the same holy ghost moving in the body filled with the Holy Ghost moved in the Holy Ghost out of every organization organized out of every organization every Kindred tongue and people so we are a people that is formed we are a people that is filled and we must be a functioning people let me just continue for just a few minutes on being formed I I you know you know God sometimes when you're reading his word he you know he illuminates certain words out of the scripture how many can say they've noticed that in their own lives you know you can read the message that's why the message a Malachi 4 never gets tiring because God keeps on opening and revealing more each time as you read the scripture the same God begins to show you a word and inspires your heart maybe to look that word up in the natural man's dictionary to find the meaning of the English word and it illuminates and so in Genesis chapter 1 we notice and I'll just be paraphrasing but in Genesis chapter 1 we read and God said let there be light and there was light verse 6 would say God said let there be firm in it in 9 verse 9 and God said that the waters and in verse 11 God said that the Earth bring forth grass and herbs the repetitive versing here is and God said and God said and it's something that is very noticeable to me that Moses under the inspiration is writing this as he's seeing what God has done and God said and God said and when God speaks something has to happen but now I want to draw your attention to our opening scripture and it says here and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground it eliminated it excited my heart because it didn't say God said that there be man except for the first spiritual man but now I see something here that struck my heart that this time God himself the scripture says he formed Man Out of the Dust of the grout the same way as he's formed the body of Jesus Christ which we all are part of and are made in particular ways and God takes man and he forms and and God he takes the time to touch he is that great high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities the songwriter would pin it down like this and we sing it many times he touched me oh he touched me how many knows hello what a joy that floods my soul something happened do you remember that day when the tender and the Jehovah touched you he personally put his hands on your 16 elements and he touched his Earthly life tenderly for God is a gentleman he's not pushy he's not rough he's he's tender and he grabbed a hold of you and formed you into His Image he touched you I want to show you for a moment the tender hand of God Adam first creation placed upon this earth created upon this Earth with one which with one law so to speak do not eat of that tree and that day you eat of it you shall die and when Adam and his helpmate they found themselves in Fault and God Came From Heaven you remember the scriptures God came and he began to cry out Adam where are you I want you to notice that God didn't lose them I want you to notice that God because even though they were hiding behind their their own little formalism and their own little doctrines and denominations fig leaves I want you to notice that God never had lost them but there was a cry from the merciful god the creator of Life Adam why did you disobey fallen from fellowship you and I but God never threw the Clay Away his law was ever true the day they ate of that tree the day they shall die and they lived short of one day but I want to tell you friends the almighty God in his tenderness already went forth fulfilling or making forth a plan we find in Genesis chapter 3 he would be the woman's seed that would bruise the head of the serpent Isaiah the blushing Prophet would say a virgin shall conceive if we can grasp hold of that Grace this morning and begin to walk God will show us where we belong in his predestinated promise for this hour calling us bride so that we would walk and be functional so I want to tell you we were all marred we are all born in sin shaped in iniquity we were as unclean of a vessel as that woman caught in adultery there was many accusation against you in fact Satan comes and he gives accusation before God he's an accuser of the brethren and he brings it before God and he brings it before you how many this morning even this week could say how many times you heard that little voice of the enemy in your head bringing accusations trying to accuse you and though the accusations are great I want to tell us this morning once again to lift up scripture I make it alive this morning we are thankful for the blood [Applause] we are thankful for the power it's not just the life of a bull and goat this morning that covers your sin but it is a life within the blood the life of God that transforms you anew I'm thankful for the buffer and thank you for the thank you Lord for that blood buffer and thank you Lord for the mercy that is spoken it is finished I paid the price neither I knew I condemn you go and sit in the mark you were once in that muck of that barnyard but one day the the master came one day his brother Brandon would say the farmer would come and take you out of that Mark and begin to wash your vessel anew and question the answers 54 brother Branham said it's like a little glass here I'd show you what here for an instance like this bottle here if it was empty and I I picked it up and it was just as dirty as it could be I wanted to use as well now the first thing I'd want to is justification I I pick it up it up because I want to use it it's dirty I found it out in the pig in the pig pen or wherever it was and now I'm right I'm the right kind of person well I don't want to put something clean in there I'm going to have to use it I'd have to fix it up first and the best thing to do is scour it first thing to do is scour it clean it and sanctify it is that right now what does the word sanctify me cleaned and set aside for service The Vessel of the old Temple were cleaned and set aside for service but I I don't want to get just caught up on the clean I don't want to just caught up on the regulations I don't want to just try to preach a legalistic word although we need to live righteous I want to slook it this morning a product of service of people that can be used by God a people now that has the Breath of Life blown into their nostrils question and answers again brother Brian would see I see Adam standing taking this way and see him standing like a tree God had made him he was dead as he could be his toes like roots sticking in the ground and God said let therapy or breathe the breadth of life into him and he jumps he became he he came to himself he breathed the breath of life into him and became a living soul now he begins to move on and move on we're talking like a locomotive moving on with the spirit of God in his very being within his within his body it was God's very own life that was breathed into Adam's nostrils I would say today is a prayer to my heart the Lord hearing here even this morning because he's here I would say Lord Breathe on Me maybe some of you have never received the Breath of Life you 've gone to a church for many years but never received the Breath of Life I would compel you with all my heart in this portion of my thought towards you allow God to scour out your old nature Hallelujah let him breathe into you his life let him breathe on you this day to receive this life and those of us who met the pillar of fire maybe some time ago I would say to us Empty Out Your Vessel that he can come and fill it again every time we come to him say Lord Bridge your life and me when I'm walking let it be you walk when the people see me they see a mere image of you Lord may it be the life of God that would Breathe us in our beings what is this Breath of Life it's God's very own life as we would say Joey lies God filling containers God filling vessels lives that can be used and can be functional for his glory we desire to come into the statue of a perfect man these words these thoughts that I'm bringing to you this morning your mature Believers eating the meat of the word you know and have many had many servants preached to you on the Statue of a perfect man and we read there as Peter would begin to speak he would say having the divine nature get the Breath of Life get the spirit of God into you and then in your life you will be added unto you but I want you to see today in from my heart that this is not a seven step program this is not a program once you've mastered faith you'll get to go all the way to virtue you're not gaining gold coins this morning for jumping a level but I want to assure you that as you were born by the one Spirit which is Christ as you were born in that spirit all the nature of God was placed into your big brother Brandon would say it like this like I oak acorn all of the characteristics all the nature of the great big old tree he's in that little acorn it's hard to see it's not in manifestation but place it in the ground Hallelujah put it in there and water it and let the soul and shine upon it and precipitation all that was within the acorn begins to grow [Music] you have faith you have virtue you have guminous preduminous power listen we don't need to always call the pastor at three in the morning and say my child is sick can you pray you have the life of God [Applause] in your being and fathers can come and lay their hands on their children mothers maybe father's not home and she calls to God I need some help my baby's fevering looks like they're unto death God help and he's a ever-present help in the time of trouble you see we have the nature of these Natures of God we do have a Godly love on the inside of us and I say to us this morning God help us to allow that to be functional to come in fruition to come into a place where we can recognize that we have this love of God First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 1. though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity have become as a sounding brass or a tingling symbol though I can do all things though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries friends the Mysteries are open before us we believe that we believe the seventh seal is open I believe it we don't know the time of the hour he shall come but the seal is open we could see in the prophet of protest the interpretation of the white horse riding deceiving the people we've seen plagues and see Wars we see him at time as we live in now where it's all missed together much together and it's a pale horse riding but there is a bride that can see past all of that why because she's functioning by elgapi love we want to know how do we move how do we operate how do I how does our locomotive get forth enough steam the force to go through it's the oh God Be Love of God that moves us though we have a gift of Prophecy or understand all the Mysteries and all the knowledge and though I have faith to to so and I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing that sounds pretty powerful I don't know about you but you know I'd like to move a mountain sometime right on in my natural stuff oh that would be amazing but friends there are mountains in our way that we cannot see their struggles we call them the goliaths whatever they may be in your path and the only way to get them out of your life is to love them remember the time brother Branham he addressed that man that he kept praying for his wife and casting the devil off his wife he'd hold her and pray in the name of Jesus Satan you leave Satan Satan brother Brown gave us advice he said why don't you just love the woman why don't you let love project he said brother Steve love function of the Bride yes there is a first fruit in our generation that's the prophet of God what we would see him he would have so much love in his heart that he'd come across a bull and the natural man was just like all of us he went to reach for his gun he was a hunter that's his first desire was to treat it the hunting way but then something overwhelmed him and he said I wish this would happen all the time what was it love projecting love projecting he wasn't just merely understanding a mystery or hitting a symbol or having some wonderful move that we would call of God it would take the projection of love and not just feel your love because feel your life can turn into hate in a moment put out God Be Loved God's very own love like he loved us from the beginning God brings forth functionality inside of our lives when we speak now to be in the image of God and form filled and malfunctioning we'll look back for just a moment at Adam when he was given the creation of the garden he was given full Dominion over the Earth we see in our generation a Son of God taking Dominion and I want you to see this for just a moment because many times people put this on the prophet's ministry as a word prophet but I wanted to tell us this morning from my heart that every son and God but daughter of God must receive the Breath of Life and the prophet of God himself needed to receive the Holy Ghost so this was a Son of God operating in Dominion and he would begin to speak and and as he would speak the weather situation changes as loud Gopi Love Is Spoken as I said uh bulls or Hornets begin to hear the voice of God animal life begins to bring come forth in the existence and in the revelation of Jesus Christ the message and from the church age book The Prophet will say right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin this is The Possession The Inheritance of a son and daughter of God filled with the Breath of Life this is not just a word prophet's Ministry this is now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praises and Glory show him forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of the good pleasure and they how the angel came to me and now is your servant I take dominion over every unclean spirit in this building this is the son of God I want you to notice this son of God use the spoken word he began to speak I take dominion over every clear unclean on spirit what about your hopes your teenager maybe walks into the house maybe they had been on Satan's ground and brought a little life that's not of Christ and there's her mother and father that have taken dominion over their homes by the word of God and they can see a spirit coming to your home and they see it and they say as the prophet of God has said here I take every unclean spirit I don't have any Dominion in the bar come on I don't have any Dominion in the places where Satan roams and walks but in this home where the blood is applied I take dominion over every Spirit every fowl of the air every atmosphere every principality of power I take control of in the name of Jesus Christ when you walk into the house of God your pastor come and begins to preach the word of God and the word begins to speak it's the Dominion of the Holy Spirit beginning to take control and begin to discern your hearts right here in the meeting we may not have that Ministry of the Prophet to stand here and tell you your name and where you came from but when the Holy Spirit comes in a mighty way and begins to anoint from the office all the way adhere to the to the desk and it begins to speak Words of Life to you I want you know friends it's God so opening up Discerning your heart God taking Dominion in the house of God brother Brown continues and I say to Satan you're a loser can you say loser one more time Satan you're a loser God has sent Christ and he's won the victory and I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of God to come out of the people functioning having Dominion Dominion to become Sons and Daughters of God meaning that we have today in our hands the king's heart it was in the hand of the prophet but I want you to notice it's been transferred down to a bride she has the king's sword she has that third pole Ministry I'll meet you in there I'll give you the word I'll meet you in that wooden box behind the veil I'll meet you there that's what God has done in each ever one of our lives wood means to be a humanity and he's met us right in our very beings right in our souls I want to make these statements like the mantle of Elijah is now on the shoulders of Elijah and we believe in a bride's Ministry in Elisha Ministry a bride coming into her position a bride that is functioning she's anointed for such a time as this I'd say to the Believers this morning we can Shout with the top of our lungs we can arise we're arising and Shining for our light has come we've received it we believe we're a functional bride oh the king soared in our hands are you with me this morning are we are we together she's got the word in her hands and our seed shall possess the Gate of the enemy we're not supposed to cry we're supposed to speak the word of God for we know behold greater is Solomon is here this is causing us to be functional we can say this day we're living in a day of Promise in a rapturing cycle we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled brother Brandon would speak these words believe us now this believe us now this God being made flesh right amongst his people now if it's okay I just want to move a little farther we often speak of these words mechanics and Dynamics and how many knows are familiar with those words and brother Brandon would say looking unto Jesus he say mechanics isn't what runs the automobile it's the Dynamics that runs it the mechanics don't run the church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets into the word may I repeat that it's the holy ghost that gets in this word it's not a seminary that teaches you all the Theology and Greek interpretations it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to set a fire and to bring to pass and to make it live just exactly what the promised word is for this hour now I said to you moments ago that I was raised in the message and I've been in countless meetings just like most of you have been and I I so enjoyed when the ministry have always gotten up and they preached the word and they used the term Dynamics I kind of always like presented as an outward expression of the Holy Ghost and so sometimes we would say and and I want to be very positive I want to tell you sometimes we say that the church was you know in a season of dryness and so then we we would get up and say well praise God we need the Dynamics and yes that's true we want some power some some joy and excitement in the church we want some demonstration and so I prayed about this and I was Lord can you give me just a little bit more Vision I I like a little more Revelation if you would Lord I want this word to live in me you see I I I want to praise God on Sunday and Wednesday and youth meeting in camps and I want I I really want to hello brother I love the Lord with all my heart I've given my entire life to the Lord but Monday I I want to live I want to function I want to go out to my job and I don't want them to see the natural Steve Clark I want the Holy Ghost by the word of God to be seen in me to live I want it to be that when I hit my finger with a hammer that out of my lips come forth the glory of God in the time of misery is this okay okay praise the name of the Lord I've hit my fingers so many times I was putting some fans it's really hot where we are too not like here but it's hot when we don't have any air conditioning in the church it's just a new little church that we've been renting and I was putting up some fans and praise the Lord I was so thankful that I had the word in my life I've never been suited to be electrician God bless the electricians in the house this morning God's given you patience like job and the spark of joy but I looked into Webster's Dictionary just to kind of get some clarity for myself when I noticed the meaning there's three and I'll bring them to you like this there's a physics perception of the meaning Dynamics it's a branch of mechanics that deals with Force and the relation primary to motion by sometimes also to the equilibrium of bodies now I'm not an engineer and I the Lord called me to be a preacher but I looked up this word also this equilibrium of bodies and it's when all forces that act upon the object are balanced then the odd shift is said to be in the state of equilibrium so we want to have a dynamic that is in motion it's like gas for the for the automobile that has some stimulation and some spark some movement but behind that movement every part of that movement has to be balanced brother Brandon would say you can't go to the left and you can't go to the right a Believer stays in the middle of the road we want to have balance for sons of God moving with power like I said moments ago a locomotive living and working and breathing in everyday lives in the balance of Jesus Christ people so balanced in the word that their motion is not this way or that way it's up we would all agree that the world is sin sick there's a disease in the lounge and there's diseases that spiritually now that are more continuous than contagious than any virus that could key on this planet sin is so contagious it is so contagious that if you don't get the Holy Ghost young people rock and roll will get you things on the internet will get you Fashions will get you so we need to be a people that recognize that there's disease in the land and we need the dynamic of God the balance of God to heal all our diseases so I was once again praying Lord can I how can I bring this to the people that I would be balanced in your word Lord brother Adam this was brought to my attention by the Lord I believe in the message why brother Brown begins to speak about doctors medicine and he calls it a toxin and he would say and now does a doctor ever get a whole how does a doctor ever get a hold of medicines anyhow do you even do it and you know what they do they put a lot of stuff together I'm not interested in stuff I don't come to church and hear my pastor preach stuff you want stuff we can get it out there getting stuff but we come here to become a bride to to be caught up in a moment to tweaking him out not to be left here I have no intentions on seeing Moses and Elijah I know they're coming but if any of us see Moses and Elijah friends we've missed it and so brother Brandon would begin to talk about sickness and he'll talk about that toxin he said well he would talk about that stuff some poison and then some antidote mix it till they mix up a formula then he says these words too much poison will kill you and too much antidote would do you would I wouldn't do you any good the medicine wouldn't it's got to be balanced formula so medicine is powerful it's a force it helps your body all those little white blood cells in our little army little guys that are fighting against the disease when you put some medicine inside it helps them win the battle we need to put some balanced diets in our bodies in the body of Christ a dynamic the the next part of the definition would begin to say Dynamics which is a pattern or a process of change growth or activity now when you think of a tender little plant and you put in a seed in you begin to water it I want you to notice that from a Little Seedling all the way to a mature plant it takes growing and that is a dynamic it's the vibration of cells vibration it drinks in and pushes out drinks in and pushes out anybody hear that familiar of saying the prophet would say drink in push out drink in push out let the light of God the son shine upon you this is ripening season this is the time and it vibrates it changes you daily you can't stay what you were yesterday you've got to eat the word I encourage you daily to eat the word read and meditate upon it pray you can't pray too much find God on your Niche you need purpose Lord what part do I play in the body find them on your knees day by day as you eat the word of God you'll become part of the original you're not going to be a a hybrid plant that you have to baby and spray and knock the worms off no our original Plants got strengthen it it can grow it can live under the most darkest circumstance that's why God placed you in this hour in leadership in a time where there's a greatest battle ever fought in the mind God placed you the part of the Bride to be at this age there's another definition which I really like the definition would be the variation this is of Dynamics the variation and contrast in force or intensity which has to do with music there you know we have some beautiful man you guys got good musicians but you know if they would not play with a dynamic we would say well maybe they just got to go back and learn a little but every musician knows that there's got to be some variation there's got to be some dynamic there's got to be some color we can't just be grouchy to all the people all the time go to church grouchy grouchy I know we let you all live in the desert you know where the leaves turn in and they become stickers but not in the house of God there's color there's expression of joy your life is a Sound of Music the dynamic is the action within the music the dynamic is the pulsation in the music looking unto Jesus and I think that the Holy Spirit can lead man and tell him things and make him act different and make him believe things and receive things that this world never could believe could happen next slide would say oh if you'll put up just put on that little video oh can't you feel that pulsation of the spirit begin to rise in your heart Saint Jesus is in our midst whatever two or three are gathered in my name I will be in their midst pulsation something moving like a heartbeat it's pumping energy in your spirit it's pumping energy in your mind then let the things that your eyes see black out then you see not the things of the world you're believing What God Says it's a pulsation of a faith it's a normal heartbeat I like normal you know some people are all about excitement I like normal 60 beats per minute I like that heartbeat 60b per minute now I want to tell you if your heart on a regular basis runs at 120 beats per minute you're going to have troubles you can't last on a hundred and beats per minute we need to have Believers that are forward marching with a steady pulsation of the world word bringing about rapturing faith the scripture says Abraham's tiger not at the promises of God Abraham house is going to happen well sir it's going to happen let's just be steady yeah it's gonna happen well Sarah says why don't you go into Hagar and take her pretty soon Abraham's heart went up to 102 20 beats per second and pretty soon we're still living with the disaster hey Abraham realize you gotta stay with the word I gotta say what he said I gotta walk as he's walked and once again he went back to 60 beats per minute staggering on at the promises of God Abraham have got some boots and they're all being knit because our promised son is coming good Sarah we're just not gonna you know worry we're gonna just keep on marching how is there going to be Rapture I don't know but it's going to happen but I'd like it to make it happen no I'm not going to make it happen we're just gonna March preach the word Noah preached the word 120 years how can you preach the same message over and over again it's going to rain well maybe I said well you know I was building today on the starboard side and we had a good time but it's gonna rain you know I was out and we were walking and we saw some of the animals coming but it's gonna rain the message was steady we need to be people that are formed a people that's filled a people that is functioning in step in rhythm to the beat of God's heart could I draw you a moment as this is just one last example before I do close I don't want to take too much of your time but I want you to notice something in the scripture in Mark chapter 11 verse 12 this is an account and I'll read it to you and on the moral when they had come from Bethany he was hungry now we're talking about Jesus he was hungry but Brandon would say he hungered like a man but when he created Fish and Loaves he was God and here Jesus he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if happily he might find I think they're on when he come to it that he found nothing but leaps from the for the time of figs was not yet you know people from Palestine they know their trees pretty good especially figs and uh when there is an abundance of leaves that means it's the season for figs and here Jesus walks up to it thinking it's looking from afar off he looks and he thinks there is fruit there on that tree but when he arrives all there is is leaves and Jesus answers said unto him and no man eat fruit from the air after now I want you to see this it's not Jesus having a temper tantrum this is Jesus fast forwarding to 2023 speaking to a people about being a functional bride so on tomorrow in the morning they passed by and they saw the fig tree dried up from its roots Peter calling to remove it saith that him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is withered away now I ask is the generality of a question to you what was wrong with the tree it had all the aspects of being a good tree now recognize when we talk about sometimes trees we talk about this being human life this was all of a tree that looked beautiful had the aspects but it wasn't functional this part of this message I like to just hone into our personal lives for just a moment and not to get too far down the road in a pastoral way but just to prick our heart just a little bit so don't worry I'm not going to go too far but I just want our hearts to be pricked for just a moment the trouble with this tree was it looked good but it wasn't functional it had all the mechanics of a good tree but it really it had no fruit we look at this tree a little closer it had good solid bark it had good solid sound doctrines good Bible teaching it had leaves that were healthy it was a tree full of Fellowship a wow that tree when the wind would begin to blow the leaves would begin to flutter Oh what a beautiful thing it is when you hear and the wind blows and this it's a beautiful a beautiful sight to hear having the right Doctrine and a good wind in the tree even those little animals like to shelter themselves under the branches of that Fellowship of the tree but Jesus walks up to that tree and he does something that nobody expects curses that tree he looks at it and says there's no life in you what use are you having all these good things of good good you know good bark and good leaps but there is no functionality to you the function of us right me you the function of us is to reproduce Jesus Christ in this hour to bring forth the word to live the word to be functioning to produce the fruit of God Oh Brother Steve huh I want to be the fruit I want to bring forth fruit how do I do it well Peter when he saw that tree wither waist he asked Jesus well what's wrong with the tree and Jesus completely ignores him what does Jesus say to him and Jesus answering saith unto him have faith in God no I'm not an interpreter but I'm my little mind that means Be steady in my little mind is just believe God in all things always believe Christ ABC's it's learning their ABCs before we get to algebra bring about the sixth sense in your life look to the Unseen speak the word and see it come to pass really believe within your being that we have returned back to any condition that I keep the fellowship with God that Fellowship on a daily basis causes us to love with agape and walk in functionality that Fellowship of God on a regular basis gives us the confidence to have dominion upon this Earth to have dominion over the powers of the air in our homes Jesus would continue and say I barely I say unto you now after he said have faith in God he says I barely I say unto you that's whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not talk in his heart but believe that those things which shall which sorry those things which he seeth shall come to pass he shall whatsoever he saith he shall have whatsoever she saith it's having that faith in the word I want us to have our hearts set upon having faith in the word this morning the word has never lost its power back home we're seeing it where we're preaching the gospel we're seeing it but the word is drawing those that have left the message a long time but by the speaking of the word they're coming home we're seeing lives that we're so messed up and one two three kids from different marriages and drugs and alcohol raise kids raised in the message fallen so far away from God mother and father says would you just come and see the new building see the new church see what's going on we stand in the pulpits and we don't know who's coming but we meet God behind the veil there in the office I want to encourage all of us to meet God on a regular basis and because for you know it God begins to speak his word through vessels of clay that desire to just be vessels of honor and by the spoken word God begins to discern arts and change lives and before you know to come to you for prayer and come repenting say Lord I want to serve you how are we going to get this tree to bring forth fruit believes in God trust in God have faith in God in our mountains shall be moved my last quotation for you this morning before we we close in the pergament church age the church age book but the brown would say like this and I believe it with all my heart and confidence the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the words she performs and commands of the word in his name for she's has thus saith the Lord I want you to have confidence this morning if you would just do something foolish for me and just raise your hand say I am the bride then this quotation is for you let the faith arise in your heart the spoken word take hold she performs the commands of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord when the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride to only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or keep still friends I just want to encourage you if you're spotting off we're speaking words that you know are not thus saith the Lord I say to your name of Jesus Christ stay still but pray unto God that he might give you his word pray unto God that from your very end there being would come forth the word of God as it was spoken in this last day for that is what is not safe now the word in this hour they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he is not complete all his work while he was a was in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in through the bride some moments ago I said the king's heart was in your hand so a moments ago I said you had a Ministry to do the prophet of God is telling us he could not complete all his work but he's got a multi-membered bride all position in a place formed for a purpose all having a a place a purpose let's not try to trample over one another let's not try to do another's job let's just work and steady rhythm with the power and the force of the Holy Ghost In Balance let us grow in the stature of the perfect man knowing our position what God has without color let the color of God comes out of our lives love love one another with a copy love God's love because that is what causes us functionality and I move up and a calling away God help us
