[47:29] requests be made known unto God and the
[47:32] peace of God which passeth all
[47:34] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[47:37] Minds through Christ Jesus finally
[47:40] Brethren so here's a reminder for the
[47:44] Brethren finally I've said all these
[47:47] things I've I've written this book but
[47:49] but here finally let me put you in
[47:52] remembrance of something
[47:54] whatsoever things are true
[47:57] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[48:00] things are just whatsoever things are
[48:03] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[48:06] whatsoever things are of good report if
[48:10] there be any virtue and if there be any
[48:13] praise
[48:15] think on these things and those things
[48:19] which ye have both learned
[48:21] and received and heard and seen in me
[48:27] do somebody say do
[48:31] and the God of Peace shall be with you
[48:34] amen you may take your seats this
[48:36] morning
[48:40] I would like to title my sermon this
[48:43] morning and speak to you on the subject
[48:48] of atmospheres
[48:51] and now we know that the atmosphere that
[48:56] surrounds the Earth it it holds the very
[48:59] air that we breathe that protects us
[49:02] from outer space it holds moisture the
[49:07] clouds the gases and tiny particles
[49:11] in short the atmosphere is the
[49:14] protective bubble in which we live
[49:18] so we could very clearly say that the
[49:23] atmosphere around the earth is extremely
[49:27] important to us as human beings
[49:30] and so it is for us as Believers the
[49:35] atmosphere that we carry around about us
[49:38] in our lives is just as important as the
[49:42] atmosphere is that surrounds the Earth
[49:46] and so without this atmosphere that
[49:49] surrounds the Earth we realize that this
[49:53] planet would not be livable
[49:56] if there was no atmosphere there would
[49:58] be no air to breathe if there was no
[50:00] atmosphere the gases wouldn't be held in
[50:02] their place if there was no atmosphere
[50:04] this Earth this planet Earth that we
[50:07] live in would not be livable
[50:10] and so we see that when we look at that
[50:13] we realize that the natural is a type of
[50:17] the spiritual
[50:18] and it's quite amazing to me that
[50:21] whenever you begin to look into
[50:24] space and you begin to look at the stars
[50:27] and you begin to look at the great Milky
[50:30] Way and all the galaxies and you see
[50:33] look at a flower and you wonder how it
[50:36] grows in the grass and how it grows and
[50:39] all these different things and you see
[50:41] the handiwork of God throughout
[50:44] everything that we look at and it's it's
[50:46] almost quite a phenomenon like there's
[50:50] things in space this works because of
[50:53] this and this goes hand in hand with
[50:55] this and when you really think about it
[50:57] as people as scientists and as human
[51:01] beings we really haven't even begun to
[51:03] scratch the surface of the handiwork of
[51:07] God and the things that surround us and
[51:09] go on in life
[51:12] it just absolutely blows our mind
[51:15] whenever we see these things and to
[51:18] think that the god that
[51:20] spoke these things into existence when
[51:24] we read our Bibles we read and it says
[51:25] and God created the heavens and the
[51:28] Earth and he spoke this and he spoke
[51:30] that but the detail that is within those
[51:34] verses of what actually happened is
[51:37] would probably blow our minds of how God
[51:41] created this Earth and so the same God
[51:45] that spoke these things into her
[51:47] existence the same God that that that
[51:50] made the earth and the galaxies and the
[51:53] grass and the moon and and for the tide
[51:55] to only come in so far and for the sun
[51:58] to shine and all these different things
[52:00] the same God that created these things
[52:03] is the same God who said he would be
[52:05] with us he's the same God he said he
[52:08] would be in us until the end of days the
[52:12] same God that created these things as
[52:15] the same God that says behold all I'm a
[52:18] friend that sticks closer than a brother
[52:20] her he said I will never leave you nor
[52:24] will I forsake you though the tides will
[52:26] command though the winds will blow
[52:28] though you'll have trials and
[52:30] temptations the very God the creator of
[52:33] the whole universe
[52:35] is not only with us but he is in US what
[52:39] a peace that should bring to us as
[52:42] Believers knowing that the God who
[52:44] created these things is with us
[52:47] so what is there to fear
[52:50] what is or to worry about well brother
[52:53] Stephen you don't understand my
[52:55] circumstance I might not but I
[52:58] understand the Creator God
[53:01] that the one who created these things is
[53:03] able to fix our situations my
[53:08] what a God we serve
[53:11] brother Branham said that what makes God
[53:14] so great is that he could make himself
[53:16] so little
[53:20] um
[53:25] so we realize that as God created this
[53:29] atmosphere around this planet Earth to
[53:33] make it livable and it's so important
[53:35] for us as Believers we can take it into
[53:38] our own lives and we can say this Earth
[53:41] let thy will be done in earth as it is
[53:45] in heaven
[53:46] so the atmosphere that we have
[53:49] surrounding Our Lives as individuals as
[53:53] Sons and Daughters of God is just as
[53:56] important that it's a good atmosphere as
[53:59] it is the atmosphere that surrounds the
[54:01] Earth
[54:02] amen
[54:05] Divine love 1957 brother Branham said
[54:09] now you've got to create
[54:12] an atmosphere
[54:15] he's not saying your mom and dad have to
[54:17] create the atmosphere he's not saying
[54:20] somebody else has to create the
[54:22] atmosphere for you but you yourself as a
[54:26] son or a daughter of God has got to
[54:28] create this atmosphere
[54:30] he says and your faith will do it they
[54:33] were all in the upper room with one
[54:34] Accord when suddenly there came from
[54:36] Heaven as a sound of a rushing Mighty
[54:39] Wind the atmosphere was right it takes
[54:42] an atmosphere to do anything
[54:47] anything it takes an atmosphere and not
[54:51] just any kind of atmosphere because
[54:53] we'll find out that just as much as
[54:55] there's a good atmosphere that we love
[54:58] and we love being around there's also a
[55:01] bad atmosphere that we don't like being
[55:03] around so it's important for us now as
[55:06] Believers because brother Branham said
[55:08] we are little creators and what's up to
[55:12] us now he says you've got to create the
[55:16] atmosphere
[55:19] so the question is how do we create the
[55:23] atmosphere how do we create the right
[55:25] kind of atmosphere Hallelujah
[55:28] brother Branham gives us these answers
[55:31] I'm sure many of you have been to uh a
[55:35] live event before whether it was whether
[55:39] it was a sporting event or whether it
[55:42] was a concert or wherever it may be
[55:45] what is it that makes it so much better
[55:48] when you go to an event live in person
[55:53] it's the atmosphere
[55:55] what is it that makes uh what is the
[55:58] difference that of going to church on on
[56:01] a Wednesday or a Sunday and streaming it
[56:04] online at home it's the atmosphere
[56:08] the people who are watching it on their
[56:10] laptop or their phone or whatever it may
[56:12] be they'll say yeah uh that was a good
[56:15] service and yeah the song was okay and
[56:18] yeah uh it was just okay but the same
[56:21] people that are watching and listening
[56:24] to the same thing
[56:25] only live
[56:29] they're watching they're listening to
[56:32] the same words to the same sermon to the
[56:35] same song special but because they're
[56:37] live in person they'll say wow this
[56:40] service was amazing it was so good what
[56:43] is it that makes it so much better it's
[56:46] the atmosphere
[56:48] what is it that makes a game so much
[56:50] better when you go and watch the game
[56:52] it's the atmosphere of the people what
[56:55] is it that makes a concert so much
[56:56] better when it's live and in person
[57:00] it's the atmosphere
[57:03] understand the building is not the
[57:06] atmosphere
[57:09] whether it's an arena whether it's a
[57:11] concert a hall or a church the
[57:14] atmosphere is not created by the arena
[57:17] or the building but the atmosphere is
[57:19] created by the people
[57:22] so you can say I want to go to church uh
[57:25] uh to get into the atmosphere no as
[57:28] Believers we need to bring the
[57:30] atmosphere to the building
[57:36] it's the atmosphere that makes it better
[57:39] there's nothing better than being there
[57:42] live and in person
[57:48] so there's when you think of a sporting
[57:51] event and
[57:53] and I'm sure all of you have either been
[57:55] to a basketball game or volleyball or or
[57:58] football or whatever it may be
[58:01] you know the atmosphere there's a
[58:04] there's a greater preparation that goes
[58:07] into going to a sporting event than just
[58:11] showing up and going to the event
[58:15] I remember one time
[58:18] talking on atmospheres uh in Ireland
[58:22] um I was like 13 or 14 years of age and
[58:25] at this time the Belfast Giants they
[58:27] just they they built a new ice rink and
[58:30] uh and they got a new ice hockey team
[58:32] and everything I'd never been to an ice
[58:34] hockey game before but one thing I note
[58:36] about ice hockey is these guys they they
[58:39] get away with fighting a lot and so just
[58:42] as it's a man thing I guess like you
[58:45] just enjoy that kind of a thing and so
[58:48] your anticipation what you're expecting
[58:50] is I'm going to go to this is talking
[58:52] game and these guys are going to get
[58:54] after it it's going to be so much fun
[58:55] they're going to hit each other up
[58:57] against the side and it's just
[58:59] it it really gets the the Beast nature
[59:03] of the man riled up absolutely
[59:05] especially as a 14 year old
[59:08] and so I remember being in the arena and
[59:10] it was my first game that I'd ever been
[59:12] to and there was these two guys that
[59:14] were sitting next to us and and it was
[59:16] just so funny because you knew that I
[59:19] was a beginner and these guys were
[59:21] seasoned veteran fans
[59:23] they had their shirts on they had the
[59:25] names in the back not only did they know
[59:28] the name of the people on their team but
[59:30] they knew the names of the people on the
[59:32] other team so we had pretty good seats
[59:34] and these guys man they were just
[59:36] shouting you know it was all clean fun
[59:38] but they were just shouting stuff at the
[59:40] other team trying to get them all riled
[59:42] up and I just remember like there was no
[59:45] fight or anything like that but I
[59:47] remember that what made this
[59:50] um this this this this this game so much
[59:53] fun for me was these two other guys
[59:56] because they were so much fun to be
[59:59] around they knew their stuff the things
[1:00:02] that they were saying was pretty funny
[1:00:03] and on and on and they were the ones
[1:00:06] that made the atmosphere of my
[1:00:08] experience so much better understand the
[1:00:12] atmosphere is created by the individuals
[1:00:16] not the arena I'm gonna really clinch
[1:00:19] that nail this morning
[1:00:21] because you are the creator of the
[1:00:25] atmosphere that's set and brother
[1:00:27] Branham said that when an atmosphere
[1:00:29] anything can happen
[1:00:33] he said the right kind of atmosphere
[1:00:36] will bring the miraculous on the scene
[1:00:41] so don't be dependent upon the song
[1:00:44] leader don't be dependent upon the
[1:00:46] church building sure we believe this
[1:00:49] this the sanctuary has been Sanctified
[1:00:51] and and God is here but don't depend
[1:00:55] upon that don't depend upon the church
[1:00:58] building depend upon yourself
[1:01:04] there's nothing better than being there
[1:01:07] in person
[1:01:09] why because the atmosphere is what
[1:01:12] changes things there's nothing like
[1:01:14] being in church
[1:01:16] there's nothing like singing and
[1:01:18] worshiping with the Believers in person
[1:01:21] and in church
[1:01:24] you remember covid
[1:01:28] remember when it was just a preacher and
[1:01:30] we all had to sit at home and stream
[1:01:33] do you remember singing on your couch
[1:01:38] you remember worshiping the Lord on your
[1:01:40] couch
[1:01:41] I thought my goodness I know I Make a
[1:01:44] Joyful Noise but I didn't think it was
[1:01:46] that bad
[1:01:48] for service oh it's nice I'm singing and
[1:01:51] I realize who am I
[1:01:52] and it goes from a sing to a talk to a
[1:01:55] whisper why because the atmosphere is
[1:01:58] not the same but when you get in amongst
[1:02:01] the Believers why is it that we can
[1:02:04] worship God in a different way than we
[1:02:06] do at home it's because we all bring a
[1:02:10] certain atmosphere with us and we're not
[1:02:13] scared to shout we're not scared to
[1:02:15] hauler we're not scared to sing at the
[1:02:18] loudness of our voices why because we're
[1:02:21] putting our voice together with
[1:02:23] everybody else's voice
[1:02:26] and what is it doing it is creating an
[1:02:29] atmosphere of worship where God is
[1:02:32] pleased with it
[1:02:36] [Laughter]
[1:02:37] I'm sorry for those that sit in front of
[1:02:40] me but I like to make
[1:02:44] I like to make a Joyful Noise
[1:02:48] have you ever heard somebody sing
[1:02:50] that they make a Joyful Noise but God
[1:02:52] has placed a song in their hearts
[1:02:55] and it's touched your heart more than
[1:02:57] somebody that could sing
[1:02:59] like an angel
[1:03:03] you've got to help us you say well uh
[1:03:06] I'm not a singer that's why I've never
[1:03:08] sang a song special before it's time for
[1:03:10] you to sing a song special
[1:03:13] let me just speak from my heart a second
[1:03:15] has any of you downloaded the podcast
[1:03:17] elf podcast raise your hands
[1:03:20] do you ever notice that it's the same
[1:03:23] probably 10 people that sing
[1:03:27] well what's going on with the rest of us
[1:03:32] why is the rest of us not up here making
[1:03:34] a Joyful Noise well I'm not a singer we
[1:03:37] didn't ask you if you were a singer or
[1:03:39] not
[1:03:41] how do you know that your Joyful Noise
[1:03:44] wouldn't be a blessing to other people
[1:03:46] within the service how do you know that
[1:03:49] your Joyful Noise wouldn't be a blessing
[1:03:51] to somebody listening to that podcast
[1:03:56] Hallelujah
[1:03:58] well I don't have a song in my heart
[1:04:01] I hear that a lot I hear it from from
[1:04:04] the ones that enjoy singing have a gift
[1:04:07] well I want to wait brother I want to
[1:04:09] wait until God really put something on
[1:04:11] my heart
[1:04:13] you know how long I would be waiting to
[1:04:15] preach
[1:04:17] huh
[1:04:19] somebody oh I'm just waiting brother Ron
[1:04:21] I can't this month
[1:04:22] Wednesday night no I don't have anything
[1:04:25] what do you think we have to do as a
[1:04:27] Ministry we've got to Humble ourselves
[1:04:29] we've got to get on our knees we've got
[1:04:31] to sensitize ourselves we've got to say
[1:04:33] father give me something for the people
[1:04:36] give me something that might help them
[1:04:38] in their lives what about you that sing
[1:04:41] father I have a gift of song I have a
[1:04:44] gift of ministry put a song on my heart
[1:04:46] that the people might be blessed
[1:04:50] because the gift is not for the person
[1:04:53] that has it it's for the people
[1:04:58] so stop holding yourself back and stop
[1:05:02] worrying what other people will think
[1:05:03] about it who cares what anybody thinks
[1:05:06] about it just do it for the Lord
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:14] there's a saying amongst the young
[1:05:17] people
[1:05:18] and they like to say that was hype
[1:05:22] oh we went there this past week it was
[1:05:24] hype or I'm going to go over there in
[1:05:27] the next couple of weeks guess what it's
[1:05:29] going to be hype and what does hype mean
[1:05:32] I guess it's gonna it means it's going
[1:05:34] to be cool it was awesome it was great
[1:05:36] it was fantastic it was so hype oh I
[1:05:39] can't wait
[1:05:41] was hype
[1:05:44] what makes it so hype
[1:05:48] when you're going to say I can't wait to
[1:05:50] go to that event it's going to be hype
[1:05:52] what are you doing in that specific time
[1:05:55] that you're saying that you're hyping up
[1:05:58] the event
[1:06:00] so the atmosphere of the event doesn't
[1:06:03] just happen at the time of the event but
[1:06:06] it happens the week leading up to the
[1:06:08] event it happens that two weeks leading
[1:06:11] up to the event it happens when you buy
[1:06:13] your tickets
[1:06:15] for the event you ever seen somebody at
[1:06:18] an event that's unhappy
[1:06:19] doesn't happen why is that because they
[1:06:22] pay for their tickets I wonder if we had
[1:06:25] to pay to come to church if you have to
[1:06:28] pay to get the seat that you like within
[1:06:30] the assembly guy guess what everybody
[1:06:33] that's there would want to be there
[1:06:35] because they don't want to waste their
[1:06:37] money
[1:06:39] Hallelujah
[1:06:40] you should give an offering an extra
[1:06:42] offering and say I'm paying for this
[1:06:45] church service today
[1:06:47] um this isn't a call for money I'm just
[1:06:49] going with it
[1:06:52] but if you were to pay for it you would
[1:06:55] enter into the service a little more if
[1:06:58] you were to pay for it there would be a
[1:07:00] different atmosphere leading up to the
[1:07:02] service
[1:07:05] a lot of people what do they do
[1:07:07] oh I'm going to the ball game I can't
[1:07:09] wait Sports Radio
[1:07:13] what are we doing when we listen to
[1:07:14] sports radio you're hyping yourself up
[1:07:17] for the event
[1:07:19] oh this guy over here and this
[1:07:21] quarterback and he's got this and he's
[1:07:23] got that and this one's got this and and
[1:07:25] this team against this team and and the
[1:07:27] last time they met and all the time
[1:07:29] you're listening to it what are you
[1:07:30] doing you're you're hyping yourself up
[1:07:33] you're getting energized about it you're
[1:07:35] you're looking up stats about uh players
[1:07:38] you're looking up this about the team
[1:07:39] you're looking up that about the team
[1:07:41] you're looking up of where your seat is
[1:07:43] going to be in the arena and you're
[1:07:44] thinking wow this is going to be so much
[1:07:47] fun I can't wait to get to the game this
[1:07:51] week
[1:07:53] I wonder now and I'm gonna go back and
[1:07:55] forth because some of you are catching
[1:07:58] that I'm going to use the natural and
[1:08:00] spiritual type and some of you aren't
[1:08:03] and so what about church
[1:08:06] what would happen if we would or take
[1:08:08] the the three or four days before the
[1:08:10] service and go my goodness church is
[1:08:13] going to be so hype I'm listening to
[1:08:16] sermons I'm reading my Bible I'm praying
[1:08:18] it's going to be so much fun it's going
[1:08:20] to be so good be the atmosphere is going
[1:08:23] to be electric and God is going to move
[1:08:26] in the scene
[1:08:27] you say well why do you believe that
[1:08:29] because I believe where two or more are
[1:08:32] gathered in his name that God is going
[1:08:34] to be in the midst I'm not just going to
[1:08:36] go to church for the sake of going to
[1:08:37] church but I'm going to meet God
[1:08:42] and when I meet God my life is not going
[1:08:45] to be the same
[1:08:50] gonna be so good it's going to be such
[1:08:52] an awesome service not because of the
[1:08:55] person that's preaching but because
[1:08:57] you're going with the intent to meet God
[1:09:00] almighty
[1:09:04] makes all the difference
[1:09:08] so everyone so they're listening to
[1:09:10] listening to talk radio and listening to
[1:09:13] this and these two teams and what's it
[1:09:15] doing it's it's getting yourself built
[1:09:18] up
[1:09:18] for this event
[1:09:20] that's laying ahead
[1:09:23] Hallelujah
[1:09:25] now what happens you're getting all
[1:09:27] built up and you're so excited
[1:09:30] and you're thinking my goodness I can't
[1:09:33] wait
[1:09:34] I sure hope we win
[1:09:36] when you go to church you don't have to
[1:09:38] hope that you're going to win
[1:09:40] because we have already won he has
[1:09:43] already overcame
[1:09:45] and so those who go to church guess what
[1:09:48] we are winners we are not people who
[1:09:51] hope but we are a people of faith we
[1:09:54] don't have to hope that God is going to
[1:09:56] move in our lives but by faith we say
[1:09:58] father I'm coming with the right
[1:10:01] attitude I'm coming with the right
[1:10:03] motive I know you're going to meet me
[1:10:12] we find out that
[1:10:14] whenever you're going to an event
[1:10:17] you don't leave five minutes before the
[1:10:19] event starts
[1:10:21] nah you're up early
[1:10:25] you're making sure everything's ready
[1:10:27] everything's prepared
[1:10:29] your shirt with your favorite ball
[1:10:31] player's name in the back of it is iron
[1:10:33] to a crisp
[1:10:36] you got your lunch made up you got your
[1:10:38] Waters you get all these things you're
[1:10:40] checking the traffic you're saying
[1:10:41] because I don't want to get there late
[1:10:45] I don't want to just get there on time
[1:10:48] in case I miss something but I want to
[1:10:51] get there early and I want to make sure
[1:10:53] that I get my seat and I want to make
[1:10:55] sure this and I want to make sure that
[1:10:57] there's the preparation that goes into
[1:11:00] it because you're excited what about
[1:11:03] church we'd only just want to get here
[1:11:05] on time no I want to get here early I
[1:11:09] want to make the right preparations to
[1:11:12] make sure that I'm not late to church
[1:11:13] that I do get my seat that my heart that
[1:11:16] I do have time to pray and seek God and
[1:11:19] get my spirit and my heart settled
[1:11:22] if we're doing it in the natural why
[1:11:25] aren't we doing it in the spiritual
[1:11:29] oh God help us
[1:11:31] it's because we're putting a priority on
[1:11:35] other things instead of the things of
[1:11:37] God but if we were to put a priority on
[1:11:40] the things of God
[1:11:41] oh let me tell you there would be an
[1:11:44] atmosphere where Miracles would happen
[1:11:47] there would be an atmosphere where
[1:11:50] people would be delivered where people
[1:11:52] would be set free an atmosphere where
[1:11:54] these these Devils that have tormented
[1:11:56] you all week long
[1:11:58] they wouldn't stand a chance
[1:12:06] what's another thing that you do leading
[1:12:08] up to a game
[1:12:09] he talked to people about it
[1:12:12] oh I can't wait it's gonna be so much
[1:12:15] fun did you get your thing booked you're
[1:12:17] going as well nice
[1:12:19] nice oh what about this what about that
[1:12:21] and you're talking and you're
[1:12:23] fellowshipping one with another about
[1:12:24] the game
[1:12:25] why because you're excited about it
[1:12:28] you're excited about the event you're
[1:12:31] excited about the concert
[1:12:34] but yet when it comes time for church
[1:12:38] oh my
[1:12:40] there's not a word said sometimes
[1:12:44] I don't want to use the word hyping it
[1:12:46] up but there's no hype up for church
[1:12:50] there's no encouraging each other for
[1:12:52] church there's no talking about the word
[1:12:55] with each other in Fellowship about
[1:12:58] church
[1:13:01] but yet we come and we expect God to
[1:13:02] move
[1:13:06] a lot of times we call them with the
[1:13:08] wrong atmosphere around us
[1:13:10] and we're expecting God to do things in
[1:13:13] our lives
[1:13:14] now I am so glad that God does not
[1:13:17] always just depend upon us
[1:13:20] and about what we have to do to get into
[1:13:22] the right conditions He's So Graceful
[1:13:25] gracious and graceful and all those
[1:13:27] different things that by the washing of
[1:13:30] the water of the word sure he cleanses
[1:13:33] us sure he washes us and he does those
[1:13:36] things for us that we do not deserve but
[1:13:39] if we were to put a little bit of effort
[1:13:41] into it
[1:13:45] Hallelujah
[1:13:49] so when we're getting ready to go
[1:13:52] throughout the week what are we doing we
[1:13:55] are creating an atmosphere
[1:13:59] an atmosphere of excitement
[1:14:02] a night atmosphere of electricity
[1:14:06] that you're wanting your team to win so
[1:14:09] bad
[1:14:10] that it's all we want to talk about it's
[1:14:12] all we want to do and all it's going to
[1:14:14] be so exciting that when you get to the
[1:14:16] arena it seems like the atmosphere is
[1:14:19] just
[1:14:20] out of this world
[1:14:24] understand when the arena is empty
[1:14:27] there's no atmosphere there
[1:14:30] it's dead
[1:14:31] there's nothing there there's no noise
[1:14:34] there's no excitement there's no there's
[1:14:36] no pumping up there's no hyping it up
[1:14:38] there's none of these things if you went
[1:14:40] to the same Arena the next day it
[1:14:43] wouldn't have the same effect as it did
[1:14:45] while everybody was there why because
[1:14:48] you've got thousands upon thousands of
[1:14:51] people that are doing the exact same
[1:14:54] thing that you are doing throughout the
[1:14:57] week getting ready for the game and what
[1:14:59] does it do when they all get together
[1:15:01] with that atmosphere it changes things
[1:15:05] it changes the atmosphere and then you
[1:15:08] go wow
[1:15:10] what an event
[1:15:14] wow
[1:15:15] that was amazing
[1:15:18] how good was that why because of the
[1:15:22] atmosphere
[1:15:25] further Ezra just came up and sat up
[1:15:27] front
[1:15:29] why he's changing the atmosphere
[1:15:33] I wonder why we said nobody sits on the
[1:15:36] front rows and we all want to sit in the
[1:15:38] back
[1:15:39] because we got a wrong kind of
[1:15:41] atmosphere
[1:15:42] but if we would get in the right kind of
[1:15:45] atmosphere and come to church with an
[1:15:47] expectation
[1:15:51] things would change
[1:15:58] if we would put the same kind of effort
[1:16:01] into going to church
[1:16:03] as we do and other things that we do
[1:16:06] God would have a special move amongst us
[1:16:13] so just think
[1:16:14] you've got all these people as
[1:16:16] individuals are doing their part for
[1:16:19] their team
[1:16:21] and they're all coming together in one
[1:16:24] Accord
[1:16:27] they're in one place
[1:16:29] and they are in one Accord
[1:16:31] and they're hoping for the same thing
[1:16:35] the disciples
[1:16:36] at the day of Pentecost they were in one
[1:16:39] place in one Accord under an expectation
[1:16:43] and under a promise of God that he would
[1:16:46] tarry ye in Jerusalem until you are
[1:16:49] endued with power they had a promised
[1:16:52] word for their day and so they were
[1:16:55] waiting upon that power they didn't know
[1:16:57] what it was going to do they didn't know
[1:16:59] what it was going to bring forth he just
[1:17:01] said Terry ye and when it comes you'll
[1:17:04] know when it comes
[1:17:08] we don't have to make believe stuff
[1:17:11] oh I felt a little something I wonder
[1:17:13] was that was that God oh I heard this I
[1:17:16] wonder was that God when God speaks to
[1:17:19] our hearts when God touches your life
[1:17:21] there's no I wondering about it you know
[1:17:24] that from that time God spoke to my
[1:17:27] heart and something changed
[1:17:34] so if we would all as individuals now
[1:17:38] come together
[1:17:40] doing our part throughout the week
[1:17:43] and we're doing this and we're praying
[1:17:45] and we're sensitizing ourselves
[1:17:47] when we come into the church as
[1:17:50] individuals with an atmosphere of God I
[1:17:54] may bring it all together as a
[1:17:56] collective body can you imagine
[1:18:01] one Accord
[1:18:03] not bickering and fighting and all that
[1:18:05] stuff with each other no one Accord
[1:18:10] remember the building or the arena
[1:18:15] is not the place with the atmosphere
[1:18:20] but the arena or the building is waiting
[1:18:24] for you
[1:18:26] to bring the atmosphere to the place
[1:18:32] Hallelujah
[1:18:37] that's why it's so important for us as
[1:18:39] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:18:43] to go to church expecting
[1:18:47] not going to church and just sit there
[1:18:50] and say well
[1:18:51] ah I wonder how it will be today
[1:18:55] I wonder who's going to preach today
[1:18:57] because brother Ron's not met I wonder I
[1:19:00] wonder no you'll go to church with an
[1:19:03] expectation
[1:19:05] because you've been building it
[1:19:07] throughout the entire week and you're
[1:19:10] not just waiting to sit down and say
[1:19:12] well God go ahead and bless me because I
[1:19:15] need blessed
[1:19:18] God can bless us throughout the entire
[1:19:20] week
[1:19:26] the atmosphere
[1:19:28] is what changes things in our lives
[1:19:33] 1956 the supernatural brother Branham
[1:19:36] says and it's the atmosphere that brings
[1:19:40] the miraculous
[1:19:41] and wonders and powers of God Among the
[1:19:45] people it's the atmosphere of
[1:19:52] it's not the atmosphere of the building
[1:19:54] it's not the atmosphere of the church
[1:19:57] but the atmosphere of the people is what
[1:20:00] brings them miraculous designs and the
[1:20:04] Wonders it's the atmosphere that brings
[1:20:07] the Deliverance Hallelujah
[1:20:11] now mix the atmosphere with the word
[1:20:15] go ahead and mix the word with faith go
[1:20:18] ahead and mix your faith with a little
[1:20:20] bit of Godly atmosphere there ain't no
[1:20:22] devil can stand in our way
[1:20:28] so the right kind of atmosphere
[1:20:31] among the people will change things in
[1:20:34] our lives
[1:20:35] and it will bring the miraculous it's
[1:20:38] just like a game
[1:20:40] you ever been to a game
[1:20:42] and your team's losing and it seems like
[1:20:45] uh they can't get off the back foot
[1:20:48] they're always on the back foot the
[1:20:49] ball's a hot potato they can't catch
[1:20:52] anything to save their lives and and
[1:20:53] here it is it's a really really tight
[1:20:55] game
[1:20:57] but all of a sudden the people
[1:21:00] get involved
[1:21:02] all of a sudden there's there's a
[1:21:04] Mexican wave starts all of a sudden
[1:21:08] they begin to sing the national anthem
[1:21:11] of the team
[1:21:13] I don't know any
[1:21:14] American national anthems whatever
[1:21:17] I just know rugby
[1:21:20] the World Cup is going on right now
[1:21:23] Ireland are doing really good
[1:21:25] might be the first time that they ever
[1:21:26] win a World Cup
[1:21:28] and so what happens when they're on the
[1:21:30] back foot the people all linked together
[1:21:34] Soldier
[1:21:36] disorder together
[1:21:39] standing strong my
[1:21:42] see these guys and make the hairs in the
[1:21:45] back of your neck stand up
[1:21:47] what do you think it does for the people
[1:21:49] the players
[1:21:51] all of a sudden they're on the back foot
[1:21:53] but their team begins to get around them
[1:21:56] there's a Mexican wave they begin to
[1:21:58] sing they begin to sing the national
[1:22:00] anthem and all of a sudden the tides
[1:22:02] turn
[1:22:03] why are the tides turning it's called
[1:22:05] home field advantage
[1:22:09] because it does something to the players
[1:22:12] they're thinking my all these people are
[1:22:15] here they're standing shoulder to
[1:22:17] shoulder they're standing with me
[1:22:19] they're joining in with song how can we
[1:22:22] stay in this position that we're in
[1:22:24] let's play a little bit harder all of a
[1:22:27] sudden they drop into gear and they're
[1:22:29] no longer on the back foot but the tides
[1:22:31] change so it is with church
[1:22:36] sometimes you might think we're on the
[1:22:38] back foot but hey we need to get
[1:22:40] together once in a while you need to
[1:22:43] tell your pastor that you love them and
[1:22:45] that you appreciate them you need to get
[1:22:47] together and sing the songs of Zion
[1:22:53] what does it do it brings a courage
[1:22:56] a courage bold
[1:22:58] a courage bold to fight the good fight
[1:23:01] of faith a courage bold to stand strong
[1:23:04] to stand upon your convictions to stand
[1:23:07] upon the word of God whether anybody
[1:23:08] believes you or not why because the
[1:23:12] people got involved
[1:23:17] Hallelujah
[1:23:21] an amen
[1:23:22] does a preacher the world of good
[1:23:28] yeah
[1:23:29] I felt good brother Paul thank you I'll
[1:23:32] say it over here
[1:23:34] and amen to the preacher does them the
[1:23:37] world of good
[1:23:40] hmm
[1:23:42] that felt good
[1:23:48] it doesn't matter how they feel in their
[1:23:50] body at that point they might be tired
[1:23:52] of morale and all these different things
[1:23:54] but when the people join together it
[1:23:57] kicks them in to another gear
[1:23:59] and some of us sitting here this morning
[1:24:02] you might be in the uh goal line defense
[1:24:06] whatever it might be you might be in the
[1:24:09] last minutes of your game you might be
[1:24:10] feeling tired wore out battle worn but
[1:24:15] guess what there's people here that love
[1:24:17] you and God is here to encourage you
[1:24:21] this morning
[1:24:26] that's the reason
[1:24:28] that I love going to church
[1:24:31] it's a time where we can just come
[1:24:34] and shut off the things of louder you
[1:24:36] see it
[1:24:39] because guess what
[1:24:41] this is what I say to myself
[1:24:44] when I leave the church building this
[1:24:46] morning
[1:24:48] the same issues that you got the same
[1:24:50] troubles guess what work is still going
[1:24:52] to be there
[1:24:53] that text message that you got before
[1:24:55] service about work it's still going to
[1:24:57] be there it's only a two-hour stretch
[1:25:02] it's not going to change anything
[1:25:03] worrying about it in the church service
[1:25:07] so I love to come to church because it's
[1:25:10] a time just to shut off from now do you
[1:25:13] see it it's a time to shut off from the
[1:25:15] trials and the troubles and all those
[1:25:17] different things and just say father
[1:25:19] this is my time with you
[1:25:24] Hallelujah leave it at the door because
[1:25:27] when you leave I'm sure it'll be waiting
[1:25:29] for you at the door again
[1:25:32] they kind of make us want to sit a
[1:25:34] little while longer after service
[1:25:35] wouldn't it
[1:25:38] if we were to say oh my my troubles are
[1:25:40] I'm not really thinking about them too
[1:25:42] much right now but when I leave they're
[1:25:43] still going to be there I'm going to sit
[1:25:45] and I'm going to worship for a little
[1:25:46] while longer I'm going to sit and I'm
[1:25:48] just going to pray for a little while
[1:25:49] after service why because I don't want
[1:25:51] to go back to that just yet I want to
[1:25:53] stay in his presence
[1:25:57] amen
[1:26:00] the supernatural 1956
[1:26:04] brother Brown says and it's the
[1:26:06] atmosphere that brings in miraculous and
[1:26:08] wonders and powers of God Among the
[1:26:10] people it's the atmosphere of the people
[1:26:12] and when people get to a place their
[1:26:15] reasoning notice this
[1:26:18] and wandering
[1:26:20] and stewing
[1:26:22] and thinking and all tore up and they
[1:26:25] don't know where they do stand half of
[1:26:28] them not even Spirit scripturally taught
[1:26:30] how can you expect the atmosphere to be
[1:26:33] right
[1:26:34] you can't do it it won't be right
[1:26:40] so he says when they're stewing
[1:26:43] when they're wandering
[1:26:45] when they're reasoning and thinking and
[1:26:48] all tore up
[1:26:51] I wonder how many of us this morning
[1:26:53] came to church reasoning
[1:26:56] Upon Our Hearts
[1:26:58] I wonder how many of us came to church
[1:27:01] having a stew within our family before
[1:27:04] service they don't know what stewing
[1:27:06] means
[1:27:07] arguing
[1:27:09] fighting bickering
[1:27:11] not homemade stew that you eat
[1:27:15] we're stewing we're arguing ah
[1:27:20] but yet come to church
[1:27:22] and want the right atmosphere brother
[1:27:24] brownham said it won't create the right
[1:27:26] atmosphere
[1:27:30] he says all tore up you can't expect it
[1:27:32] no you can't it won't be right listen
[1:27:35] this is phenomenal it's got to be in one
[1:27:38] Accord
[1:27:40] one place and settle down with one
[1:27:42] motive one thing then you're going to
[1:27:45] see something happen
[1:27:47] when they were in one place in one
[1:27:50] Accord the word of God was fulfilled in
[1:27:53] the book of Acts
[1:27:57] it don't only work that but if you'd
[1:27:59] look at it in the scientific World say
[1:28:01] you're all a whole bunch of salesmen and
[1:28:04] you're going to sell Chevrolets or
[1:28:06] Pontiacs or some kind of a car and the
[1:28:09] one in his heart really thinks the
[1:28:12] dude Bakers is that a car
[1:28:16] huh
[1:28:17] it is
[1:28:18] I might show them my age right now
[1:28:24] are better and so forth like that I bet
[1:28:26] you that's when cars before they even
[1:28:28] had seat belts huh
[1:28:32] crank this thing up here
[1:28:38] get us all in here and saying the Buick
[1:28:40] is best and the other one some other car
[1:28:43] get us together like that you could
[1:28:45] never have the right kind of a meeting
[1:28:47] taking in the devil's work go over and
[1:28:50] say we're we're going to a dance
[1:28:53] one man stand up saying well
[1:28:56] he don't know about whether he wants to
[1:28:58] dance or not and this girl over she and
[1:29:01] she and the music playing near to God
[1:29:04] near my God to thee
[1:29:07] huh
[1:29:08] what an atmosphere for a dance
[1:29:12] well that's not any different than what
[1:29:15] a lot of atmospheres you go into church
[1:29:17] for service of God just to contrary
[1:29:19] right
[1:29:21] what's he saying you go to a dance and
[1:29:23] you're expecting the dance music and all
[1:29:25] these different things and they begin
[1:29:26] playing near my God to thee
[1:29:29] it doesn't belong that kind of music
[1:29:32] doesn't belong at the dances and he says
[1:29:35] you go into some church services and he
[1:29:38] says it's quite the contrary where
[1:29:40] you're expecting a song like near my God
[1:29:42] to thee and all of a sudden it's a rock
[1:29:45] concert
[1:29:46] it's dance music it's it's wooky Boogie
[1:29:49] music whatever it may be he says quite
[1:29:52] the contrary it shouldn't be there it's
[1:29:54] the wrong kind of atmosphere
[1:29:58] I feel like we're depending upon the
[1:30:00] wrong kind of music that brings that
[1:30:03] kind of atmosphere into our churches
[1:30:05] when it doesn't belong there
[1:30:10] Hallelujah
[1:30:14] he says well let's well that's not any
[1:30:16] different than a bunch of church service
[1:30:19] for a service of God just the contrary
[1:30:21] right the only thing to bring the right
[1:30:23] atmosphere then for the dance is to put
[1:30:26] on your old music that makes dances
[1:30:29] and everybody get thinking what a good
[1:30:31] time they're going to have dancing and
[1:30:34] so forth and they'll be having a big
[1:30:37] whooping time
[1:30:40] first of all they think about it
[1:30:43] what are they doing they're they're
[1:30:45] preparing themselves for the dance
[1:30:48] and when the dance finally comes they
[1:30:51] have a whoop upping time why because
[1:30:54] they've prepared themselves for it
[1:30:57] read between the lines
[1:31:02] put the right kind of a music on the
[1:31:04] piano the organ and everybody in the
[1:31:06] atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there
[1:31:08] and going to meet everything that they
[1:31:10] have need of something will go to taking
[1:31:13] place
[1:31:14] atmosphere but that's the hardest thing
[1:31:18] there is to do and that is to get people
[1:31:21] in that atmosphere notice not an
[1:31:24] atmosphere of whoop upping and and
[1:31:26] having a boogie woogie time but an
[1:31:29] atmosphere of worship
[1:31:32] the atmosphere of believing
[1:31:36] the atmosphere of believing comes with
[1:31:40] the atmosphere of worship and the
[1:31:43] atmosphere of worship comes with the
[1:31:46] right attitude it comes with the right
[1:31:48] preparation it comes with the right
[1:31:51] music being played Hallelujah and it
[1:31:53] comes with the right life being lived by
[1:31:56] the people
[1:31:59] amen atmospheres
[1:32:06] he said and that's the reason paragraph
[1:32:08] 23 sometimes the Divine Life that's been
[1:32:12] called and set aside has become a
[1:32:14] fanatic or crazy or Mystic or something
[1:32:16] to the eyes of the general public is
[1:32:18] because you're considered I'd say an
[1:32:21] erotic or an insane person is because
[1:32:23] that you have changed your dwelling
[1:32:25] place and got into a different
[1:32:27] atmosphere
[1:32:30] and let me just say this as it as it
[1:32:33] comes to me you know loudi Asia has its
[1:32:36] own atmospheres but we as Believers as
[1:32:38] the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not no
[1:32:41] longer we should not be no longer in the
[1:32:44] atmosphere of laodiacia we should not be
[1:32:47] no longer in the atmosphere of the man
[1:32:49] anointing but the bride has come up a
[1:32:52] little bit higher the anointing has
[1:32:54] taken us out of ladies and the chaos of
[1:32:57] ladies here and to the anointing or the
[1:33:00] atmosphere or the inspiration of the
[1:33:03] eagle
[1:33:05] brother Branham says that eagle is a
[1:33:07] special bird he said he can fly way
[1:33:10] higher into the atmospheres than any
[1:33:13] other bird that there is why because
[1:33:15] he's especially built bird who is bestly
[1:33:18] designed for higher atmospheres and
[1:33:21] higher altitudes so is the Bride of
[1:33:23] Jesus Christ
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:26] were built for Higher Ground we're built
[1:33:29] for higher atmospheres we're built for
[1:33:32] uh uh a higher revelation of the word
[1:33:38] that's why you catch it
[1:33:40] not because you've heard it multiple
[1:33:42] times before but you catch it in your
[1:33:45] heart because you've been designed to
[1:33:48] catch it and hold it in your heart
[1:33:51] amen
[1:33:56] he says you've changed your dwelling
[1:33:58] place and got into a different
[1:33:59] atmosphere notice what it's going to do
[1:34:01] to you when that happens when you change
[1:34:04] your Dwelling Place into a different
[1:34:06] atmosphere people are going to say
[1:34:07] you're a neurotic
[1:34:09] people are going to say you're crazy
[1:34:11] people gonna say you're far out people
[1:34:13] are going to say this you're a Holy
[1:34:14] Roller whatever it might be
[1:34:17] why
[1:34:19] because you've changed your atmosphere
[1:34:26] he says in your one motive your one
[1:34:29] thought is to stay in that atmosphere
[1:34:35] my
[1:34:37] once you get into the
[1:34:39] the higher calling of Christ and once we
[1:34:42] get into that higher atmosphere where
[1:34:45] all things are possible
[1:34:47] our desire and our motives is to always
[1:34:50] get back to that spot
[1:34:53] you have experiences with God
[1:34:56] huh God moves on your heart
[1:34:58] supernaturally it's a special time
[1:35:00] between you and God and after that time
[1:35:02] you always our desires as Believers is
[1:35:05] to go back I want it to happen again I
[1:35:07] want it to happen again I want it to
[1:35:09] happen again and as long as our lives
[1:35:11] are right I believe that it will happen
[1:35:13] again
[1:35:17] he said any person that ever come into
[1:35:20] that atmosphere one time will never be
[1:35:23] satisfied nowhere else
[1:35:26] you can't satisfy the thirst for God
[1:35:31] with worldly things
[1:35:34] it's never going to happen
[1:35:36] so you might as well just stop it
[1:35:39] you might as well just stop searching
[1:35:40] for it on the internet you might as well
[1:35:43] just stop searching for it maybe if I
[1:35:46] listen to this preacher or if I listen
[1:35:48] to that preacher or or if I go over here
[1:35:49] maybe that'll be no that's not it
[1:35:54] Hallelujah
[1:36:00] nothing else will ever satisfy and
[1:36:03] that's why I believe that we should have
[1:36:04] our churches under control by the holy
[1:36:06] ghost that men and women in their work
[1:36:09] and wherever they should be should
[1:36:11] continually desire and they will if
[1:36:14] they've ever once come into that
[1:36:17] atmosphere
[1:36:19] I want to ask you what is it that keeps
[1:36:22] you coming back to church
[1:36:24] what is it that keeps you coming back to
[1:36:27] God because you're searching for that
[1:36:30] atmosphere
[1:36:32] you're searching for that special
[1:36:34] something you might walk away for a
[1:36:37] little while you might make wrong
[1:36:39] choices and wrong decisions but what is
[1:36:41] it that brings you always back to the
[1:36:44] house of God let me tell you it's not
[1:36:46] your family
[1:36:49] if it was your family you would just
[1:36:51] come and go and come and go when the
[1:36:53] family asks you to come and go
[1:36:56] but when you come to the house of God
[1:36:58] what is it that brings a person back and
[1:37:01] that they stay in the house in the
[1:37:03] presence of God is because that
[1:37:05] atmosphere that you are craving and it's
[1:37:08] that atmosphere that you're wanting God
[1:37:10] to speak to your heart
[1:37:15] Hallelujah
[1:37:20] I remember
[1:37:23] when I first got converted
[1:37:25] and
[1:37:27] give my heart to the Lord and everything
[1:37:29] and
[1:37:30] and uh you know you think it's hard
[1:37:33] being a sinner
[1:37:34] oh once you become a Christian
[1:37:37] now you get all sorts of troubles
[1:37:39] got all sorts of tempting you got all
[1:37:41] sorts of people pulling you all over the
[1:37:43] place here and there and everywhere and
[1:37:44] you're thinking my goodness but there's
[1:37:46] something that's within us there was
[1:37:48] something that that was within me that
[1:37:51] that that that I wanted more
[1:37:55] understand if there's a craving for more
[1:37:58] of God there's more of God for you
[1:38:03] it's a deep that's calling to the Deep
[1:38:08] and I can say this
[1:38:10] it wasn't it wasn't Rocco that kept me
[1:38:13] going back to church
[1:38:14] though I loved him
[1:38:17] and though I worked with them every day
[1:38:18] and and he was one of my best friends
[1:38:20] but it wasn't because of him that kept
[1:38:23] me going back
[1:38:25] it was because of God
[1:38:27] and I knew it was real and I knew that I
[1:38:31] wanted more
[1:38:38] Vincent
[1:38:41] it's not because of brother Amos
[1:38:44] that you keep coming to church
[1:38:47] otherwise when he's not here you
[1:38:49] wouldn't be here
[1:38:52] Zach
[1:38:53] same thing
[1:38:55] it's not because of brother Amos that
[1:38:57] you're maybe it started that way but
[1:39:00] there's something that's drawing you
[1:39:02] it's a deep that's calling to the Deep
[1:39:04] you might under might not understand
[1:39:06] what it is but it's God it's God dealing
[1:39:09] with your heart it's God bringing you to
[1:39:12] the church it's God that's that's
[1:39:13] pulling you and wanting you and drawing
[1:39:16] something out of you that's making you
[1:39:18] want to serve him it's not a man
[1:39:23] how about that
[1:39:25] God the creator of all the universe
[1:39:29] draws us and he pulls us out of the muck
[1:39:32] in the Mary clay because he wants
[1:39:34] Fellowship
[1:39:36] one-on-one personally with us as
[1:39:38] Believers my goodness
[1:39:40] what a God we serve what a wonderful God
[1:39:44] he is
[1:39:46] all because he wants Fellowship
[1:39:51] this isn't the work of a man
[1:39:54] God
[1:39:56] young people you think you're here well
[1:39:58] just because my family's here and I go
[1:40:00] to church it's wrong God's drawing you
[1:40:03] God's working on your life God's working
[1:40:06] on your hearts
[1:40:11] Hallelujah
[1:40:13] think well
[1:40:15] if you have the attitude I go just
[1:40:16] because Mom and Dad go
[1:40:18] wrong attitude
[1:40:20] but you can't stand the presence of God
[1:40:24] and something not happened
[1:40:28] that little hen
[1:40:30] a little egg brother Brown talks about
[1:40:32] him the little eagle
[1:40:35] a little
[1:40:37] and that thing cracks what happened said
[1:40:39] put that thing under a different
[1:40:40] atmosphere
[1:40:41] is it it it it it births it right and he
[1:40:46] says that little that little chicken egg
[1:40:47] or whatever it is he goes put it under a
[1:40:49] puppy
[1:40:51] what'll happen it'll be birthed because
[1:40:55] it's under the right atmosphere
[1:41:00] some of you think you just come to
[1:41:02] church because of whatever
[1:41:04] and it's not because of God yeah you're
[1:41:07] still in your shell man
[1:41:09] but just watch you get under the right
[1:41:11] atmosphere
[1:41:13] you'll be birthed
[1:41:18] it'll be hard
[1:41:20] any birth is messy
[1:41:22] you gotta pick your own way out of it
[1:41:28] say well
[1:41:29] why does nobody it's hard why won't
[1:41:32] nobody pray for me yeah because God's
[1:41:33] working on you
[1:41:35] some of us are have a harder shell than
[1:41:38] others
[1:41:40] and you've got to pick for a little
[1:41:42] while longer
[1:41:44] but when you're in the right atmosphere
[1:41:49] you're going to pick your own way out of
[1:41:50] your shell
[1:41:52] and when you do you know it's going to
[1:41:53] be real
[1:41:55] Hallelujah
[1:41:58] atmospheres change things
[1:42:04] I think it's important for us
[1:42:06] has
[1:42:10] families heads of the homes
[1:42:14] to realize that we are atmosphere
[1:42:16] Setters in our homes
[1:42:21] there's a quote it's probably for next
[1:42:23] service but there's a quote where
[1:42:25] brother Brown's talking about uh
[1:42:27] forget who it was but their son didn't
[1:42:30] turn out right
[1:42:31] he said yeah I think it was Jezebel
[1:42:34] their family was cursed
[1:42:36] he said how can you expect a family
[1:42:37] that's cursed for their kids to come out
[1:42:39] right he said they're under the wrong
[1:42:41] atmosphere
[1:42:42] wonder how many of us
[1:42:45] have the wrong atmosphere in our homes
[1:42:48] and we bring our kids to Sunday school
[1:42:50] we bring our kids to youth meetings
[1:42:52] bring our kids to church we expect to
[1:42:54] minister and the youth leaders to take
[1:42:56] care of her kids
[1:42:58] how can you expect that to happen when
[1:43:00] the atmosphere at home is wrong
[1:43:07] but if we were to take it upon ourselves
[1:43:09] and say you know what maybe this is
[1:43:10] because of me
[1:43:12] maybe I've set the wrong atmosphere in
[1:43:14] my home maybe I've set the wrong
[1:43:15] priorities in my home and maybe this is
[1:43:18] because of me as the head of my house
[1:43:20] I've made wrong decisions and this is my
[1:43:23] fault first step is good recognize that
[1:43:25] it's your fault
[1:43:27] no as a man what do we do we fix things
[1:43:31] so now we fix it
[1:43:32] we're creators made in the image of God
[1:43:35] so maybe the atmosphere is wrong but
[1:43:38] from this point forth we can change it
[1:43:41] and when we change the atmospheres
[1:43:43] guess what there's a change I'm coming
[1:43:48] amen
[1:43:50] so we realize that there's a right kind
[1:43:53] of atmosphere and there's also a wrong
[1:43:55] kind of atmosphere that as Believers we
[1:43:58] can carry with us
[1:44:00] the wrong kind of atmosphere is that of
[1:44:03] fussing fussing and reasoning and
[1:44:05] envying one another wandering and
[1:44:08] stewing and all these different things
[1:44:09] that we can get so easily caught up with
[1:44:12] as believers
[1:44:17] understand that we fight against
[1:44:20] principalities against Powers against
[1:44:23] the rulers of Darkness against against
[1:44:25] all these different unseen forces that's
[1:44:29] coming against us as Believers and they
[1:44:31] want to use our family against us they
[1:44:35] want to turn us against one another
[1:44:40] and I want to say Lord help us
[1:44:44] to realize the issues and to take care
[1:44:48] of it
[1:44:50] and if that means for one of us
[1:44:53] to truly humble ourselves and say we're
[1:44:56] sorry
[1:44:57] for something that you don't even think
[1:44:59] you were wrong in
[1:45:02] that's what we got to do
[1:45:06] takes Holy Ghost Revelation to do that
[1:45:11] because you're no longer thinking about
[1:45:14] ourselves
[1:45:16] but we're thinking of the outcome of
[1:45:19] what it's going to produce
[1:45:22] Hallelujah that's beautiful
[1:45:25] amen
[1:45:26] amen
[1:45:30] 1963 is your life worthy of the gospel
[1:45:33] and did you know you are a little
[1:45:36] Creator yourself you know that certainly
[1:45:39] you've seen people that just love that
[1:45:42] you just love to be around
[1:45:43] you don't know why just that loving type
[1:45:47] of person have you seen that just as
[1:45:49] kind there you like to be around them
[1:45:52] they create atmosphere
[1:45:55] listen to this by the life that they
[1:45:59] live the way they walk and their
[1:46:03] conversation
[1:46:05] so how do they create an atmosphere
[1:46:08] around them that makes other people want
[1:46:11] to be around them it's because of the
[1:46:14] life they live it's because of of the
[1:46:17] way they talk and their conversation it
[1:46:22] creates the right kind of attitude right
[1:46:26] kind of atmosphere
[1:46:28] then you've seen those that every time
[1:46:31] you shun them
[1:46:33] all time
[1:46:35] they want to talk about something evil
[1:46:37] and talk about somebody
[1:46:39] not anybody in elf I would assume
[1:46:41] say oh my there they come they're going
[1:46:46] to criticize somebody there he's in here
[1:46:49] now he's going to talk about this man
[1:46:51] all they're going to do is tell dirty
[1:46:53] jokes or something about women or
[1:46:55] something like that you just hate to get
[1:46:58] around them see they create seemingly
[1:47:01] pretty nice people but they create that
[1:47:04] atmosphere
[1:47:07] and the things that you think on
[1:47:10] the things that you do the actions the
[1:47:14] things you talk about creates an
[1:47:17] atmosphere
[1:47:20] you ever had that person or multiple
[1:47:22] people in your life
[1:47:24] and all they want to do is is find the
[1:47:27] bad and everything
[1:47:29] all they want to do is talk about this
[1:47:31] person all they want to do is talk about
[1:47:32] and you see them coming and you think oh
[1:47:34] my goodness here they come
[1:47:37] what is it going to be today
[1:47:41] same thing as last week oh my
[1:47:44] same thing as the week before
[1:47:46] and they create this atmosphere around
[1:47:49] them that though they're nice people
[1:47:52] though they're Believers within the
[1:47:55] assembly
[1:47:56] though you love them because they're
[1:47:58] your brother and sister in the Lord
[1:48:00] there's just something that you wanna
[1:48:05] arm's length
[1:48:08] what is it that makes us feel that way
[1:48:10] about certain people it's the atmosphere
[1:48:13] that they have created around them and
[1:48:16] how have they created this Atmosphere by
[1:48:18] the things that they're thinking on
[1:48:23] how to criticize and the bad and
[1:48:25] everything and this that and the other
[1:48:28] the things that they do the actions the
[1:48:32] things that they're talking about these
[1:48:34] things all mixed together it has created
[1:48:37] an atmosphere around this individual and
[1:48:40] guess what where none of us can point
[1:48:42] fingers because at certain times in our
[1:48:44] lives guess what we are that individual
[1:48:53] if the musicians would come
[1:48:55] we'll bring this to a close
[1:49:00] brother Branham said
[1:49:02] that the right kind of atmosphere will
[1:49:04] bring the miraculous on the scene
[1:49:08] so the question is this
[1:49:10] for us as Believers how do we get
[1:49:13] ourselves into the right kind of
[1:49:16] atmosphere
[1:49:18] it starts with our opening scripture
[1:49:19] Philippians 4 verse 8.
[1:49:23] finally brethren
[1:49:25] whatsoever things are true
[1:49:29] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:49:32] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:49:34] pure
[1:49:35] these things are a sermon within
[1:49:38] themselves
[1:49:39] the whatsoevers is a sermon within
[1:49:42] itself and how to create the right kind
[1:49:44] of atmosphere around us as believers
[1:49:49] whatsoever things are lovely
[1:49:52] whatsoever things are of a good report
[1:49:57] if there be any virtue
[1:50:00] and if there be any praise
[1:50:03] these are the things to think on
[1:50:10] but yet and louder you see her we get
[1:50:12] caught up with the complete opposite
[1:50:15] we get caught up with whatsoever things
[1:50:17] are bad
[1:50:20] we get caught up in wandering into other
[1:50:22] people's business and and how their life
[1:50:24] is going we get caught up with this that
[1:50:27] and the other we get caught up with
[1:50:29] listening to the wrong kind of voices
[1:50:31] and the wrong kind of music and the
[1:50:33] wrong kind of this and we get so caught
[1:50:35] up with these things that without even
[1:50:37] realizing it we're creating an
[1:50:40] atmosphere around us that people don't
[1:50:42] want to be around
[1:50:46] so it all starts with the mind
[1:50:49] it starts with the greatest battle
[1:50:51] that's been ever fought
[1:50:54] the things that we're thinking on
[1:51:00] it's so easy for us to get caught up
[1:51:02] with the carnality of our Humanity
[1:51:07] that we forget to look at the positive
[1:51:11] we forget to look at the virtue we
[1:51:13] forget to look at the things that are
[1:51:15] lovely we forget to look at the things
[1:51:17] of a good report something of a virtue
[1:51:21] we pass over it to look at the ugly
[1:51:24] the things that are true
[1:51:27] we pass it over
[1:51:29] and we look at the opposite
[1:51:32] it starts with our mind and it goes from
[1:51:34] our mind to our mouth
[1:51:37] because he is the high priest of our
[1:51:41] confession
[1:51:43] and so now what starts in our mind it
[1:51:46] goes into our mouth
[1:51:48] and what comes out of our mouth
[1:51:51] those are the things Jesus said that
[1:51:54] defiles a man
[1:51:57] when it comes out of the mouth now it's
[1:52:00] it's already in our hearts
[1:52:02] because as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:52:04] so he is
[1:52:06] and so when a man is thinking about all
[1:52:09] these uh impurities and and and and the
[1:52:12] things that are opposite to what we have
[1:52:14] just read guess what happens now our
[1:52:17] heart becomes contaminated though we're
[1:52:20] still a believer
[1:52:22] though we're still seed this is
[1:52:25] spiritual warfare
[1:52:30] and it comes from our hearts and it goes
[1:52:32] out our mouths and when we say something
[1:52:35] typically we believe it
[1:52:37] or we wouldn't say it
[1:52:40] and it goes from our mouth now to our
[1:52:42] lives
[1:52:44] and now all of a sudden our lives and
[1:52:47] the atmosphere around us
[1:52:49] is so contaminated
[1:52:51] and it's so filthy and it's so caught up
[1:52:54] with the things of this world it's so
[1:52:55] caught up with the things it brings a
[1:52:57] bad atmosphere that guess what all of a
[1:52:59] sudden now
[1:53:01] we're way out left field
[1:53:06] when we should be playing tightly
[1:53:08] together like a softball team there they
[1:53:10] got that group there and they got that
[1:53:13] the core group there that's in the
[1:53:15] middle they're like well why is this guy
[1:53:17] way out left field he's supposed to be
[1:53:19] playing shortstop
[1:53:21] what's he doing there he's way out there
[1:53:23] he's out of position he's not called to
[1:53:26] be out there he should be here
[1:53:29] how did he get out there how did she get
[1:53:31] out there how did I get out there Lord
[1:53:35] how am I so far out
[1:53:38] in my life
[1:53:40] how have I got this bad attitude how
[1:53:43] have I got this Aura and atmosphere
[1:53:45] around me that
[1:53:47] that nobody wants to be around
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:52] because I've been giving myself to the
[1:53:54] wrong things
[1:53:57] I've been given my thoughts to the wrong
[1:53:59] things
[1:54:00] I've been giving my eyes to the wrong
[1:54:02] things been given my ears to the wrong
[1:54:05] things
[1:54:06] and before we know it now it's just

[1:56:52] Heavenly Father
[1:56:54] Lord

[1:56:59] way but yet here we are
[1:57:04] we're calling Lord
[1:57:07] to attention
[1:57:09] and perhaps father some have
[1:57:12] found themselves Lord playing it
[1:57:16] in a position where they shouldn't be
[1:57:18] playing

[1:57:22] shouldn't be thinking

[1:57:32] as believers
[1:57:34] but father God
[1:57:36] you always give warning before judgment
[1:57:40] and I believe you're warning us this
[1:57:42] morning
[1:57:43] that now the ball is in our core
[1:57:46] now it's up to us father
[1:57:49] to do something about it

[1:57:54] you would Quicken hearts
[1:57:57] and that you would change lives
[1:58:00] Lord that you would change directions in
[1:58:03] which people are walking in
[1:58:06] and let it be for thy Kingdom's Glory
[1:58:08] father
[1:58:09] as every head is bowed this morning
[1:58:13] and every eye is closed
[1:58:16] perhaps you've found yourself
[1:58:19] in a position that you know you
[1:58:21] shouldn't be in you're not walking
[1:58:22] accordingly to the things that Paul said
[1:58:24] those things that you see and you've

[1:59:12] from this time forth get back into your
[1:59:15] position
[1:59:17] something that's very personal between
[1:59:19] you and God
[1:59:20] it's not between you and a man
[1:59:23] it's not something you have to confess
[1:59:24] to a high priest
[1:59:26] but he is the high priest
[1:59:28] of our confession he is our mediator
[1:59:32] he's the only one that you have to bring
[1:59:34] these things to
[1:59:36] father
