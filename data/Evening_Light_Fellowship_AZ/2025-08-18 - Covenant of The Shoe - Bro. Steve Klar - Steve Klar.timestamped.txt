[16:52] when God's people humble themselves and
[16:55] call on Jesus.
[16:58] And they looked in heaven expecting that
[17:01] they pray.
[17:03] I just feel like something good about
[17:09] brother could be that very
[17:13] I have learned that all that happened
[17:16] just to praise him
[17:18] for I know he's working all things for
[17:21] my good.

[17:29] for I know he'll see me through. He said
[17:31] he would

[17:39] all the things he had for those who
[17:42] pray.

[18:05] But for this child of God, it makes no
[18:08] difference

[19:02] cross of Calvary.

[27:00] Barabus so afraid
[27:04] for he knew this was the day
[27:08] judgement would be served and he would
[27:11] die.
[27:14] He heard footsteps down the hall.
[27:19] Then his name was called
[27:22] as a Roman soldier stepped inside.
[27:29] He could not believe
[27:32] the centurion said, "You're free." For
[27:36] he knew he had done these awful crimes.
[27:43] Rabbus said, "How can this be? For I
[27:46] know I've done these deeds."
[27:50] Then the centian
[27:53] rely,
[27:56] "Look up, yonder on the cross.
[28:02] The middle man has paid your cost.
[28:09] See the nails in his hands and feet.
[28:16] He's the reason you're redeemed.
[28:22] See the wounds in his sight.
[28:28] His blood has given you life.
[28:35] The mockery spits upon his face.
[28:39] This is your disgrace.
[28:42] Jesus took your place.
[28:50] Like Barabus, so was I.
[28:54] Sentenced to die.
[28:57] Prison for the crimes I done. Feeling
[29:03] broken and afraid, knowing that I'd have
[29:08] to face
[29:10] judgment day
[29:12] surely come.
[29:16] Then a voice so sweet and kind said,
[29:19] "Let her go. This child is mine.
[29:22] She has no faults. Her record is clean.
[29:28] As I have showed Mira's grace, so have I
[29:33] taken her place. 2,000 years ago up on
[29:38] that tree.
[29:41] Look up yonder on the cross.
[29:47] The metal man is painted.
[29:54] See the nails in his hands and feet.
[30:00] He's the reason you're redeemed.
[30:06] See the wounds in his side.
[30:12] His blood has given you life.
[30:19] A mockery spit upon his face.
[30:23] This was your disgrace.
[30:26] Jesus took your place.
[30:31] Look up yonder on the cross.
[30:37] The middle man has paid your cost.
[30:44] See the nails in his hands and feet.
[30:50] He's the reason you're redeemed.
[30:56] See the wounds in his side.
[31:02] His blood has given you life.
[31:08] The mockery spit upon his face.
[31:12] This was your disgrace.
[31:15] Jesus took your place.
[31:24] Amen.
[31:28] Amen.
[31:31] Amen. We have a third song, especially
[31:32] Alicia Arolo. She'll get ready to sing.
[31:35] But before we do, I'd like to sing,
[31:36] "You're my glory and the lifter of my
[31:38] head today." Amen. Aren't you glad? He's
[31:41] your glory this morning.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Psalms 3, chapter 3 says, "You're my
[31:45] glory
[31:47] &gt;&gt; and the lifter of my head this morning."
[31:49] My blessings this morning to lead you
[31:52] through your destiny.
[31:54] And you're my glory
[31:59] and the lifter
[32:01] of my head.
[32:07] You're my glory
[32:12] and the lifter
[32:14] of my hand.
[32:21] For thou,
[32:24] oh Lord,
[32:27] art shield
[32:30] for me,
[32:34] my glory
[32:37] and the lift. If he is this for you this
[32:41] morning, lift your hands and sing it one
[32:43] more time. And you're my glory.
[32:45] And you're my glory
[32:50] and the lifter
[32:52] of my hand.
[32:56] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[32:59] You're my glory
[33:03] and the lifter
[33:05] of my heart. Oh, he's a shield for you
[33:10] and I. Lord,
[33:12] thou
[33:18] are
[33:21] glory
[33:28] and the lifter
[33:30] of
[33:36] Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap of
[33:37] praise this morning.
[33:42] Tomorrow, Brother Rod Brand will be 67.
[33:45] So, please tell him happy birthday after
[33:47] service. May the Lord continue to watch
[33:49] over Brother Rod and everything from his
[33:52] family this morning. God bless him.
[33:54] Happy birthday, Brother Rod.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord bless Alicia as she sings
[33:58] this morning.
[34:25] The room grew still
[34:28] as she made her way to Jesus.
[34:33] She stumbled
[34:35] from the tears I held her blind.
[34:43] With such pain,
[34:47] some spoken anger
[34:51] heard folks whisper.
[34:53] There's no place for her kind.
[35:01] Still on she came
[35:04] through the sin that flushed her face.
[35:08] Till at last
[35:11] she knelt before his feet.
[35:18] And though she spoke no words,
[35:22] everything she said was hers.
[35:26] that she poured her love for the master
[35:31] from her box of alabaster.
[35:38] And I've come to pour
[35:44] my praise on
[35:48] like oil
[35:50] from Mary's
[35:53] alabaster.
[35:58] And don't be angry if I wash this fear
[36:04] with my tears.
[36:06] And I dry them with my hair.
[36:16] And you weren't there
[36:20] the night he found me.
[36:25] You did not feel what he felt when he
[36:29] wrapped his loving arms around me. end.
[36:35] You don't know the cost of the yoyo
[36:41] in my buster
[36:45] box.
[36:54] I can't forget
[36:57] the way life used to be.
[37:01] I was a prisoner from the sins that held
[37:05] me bound.
[37:11] I spent my life
[37:14] I poured it without measure
[37:18] into a little treure box that I've
[37:23] found.
[37:28] until the day
[37:30] when Jesus came to me and tilled my soul
[37:36] with the waters of his touch.
[37:42] So now I'm giving back to him.
[37:47] All the praise he's worthy of. I am
[37:51] forgiven.
[37:53] And that's why
[37:55] I love him so much.
[38:02] And I've come to pour
[38:08] my praise on
[38:11] like oil
[38:13] from Mary's
[38:16] alabaster box.
[38:20] And don't be angry if I wash his feet
[38:26] with my tears
[38:28] and I've dry them with my hair
[38:37] and you weren't there
[38:41] the night he found me.
[38:45] You did not feel what he felt when he
[38:50] wrapped his loving arms around me. And
[38:55] you don't know the cost of the oil
[39:01] and my alabaster
[39:04] box.
[39:07] Oh, when I've come to pour
[39:13] my praise on him
[39:16] like oil
[39:19] from Mary's
[39:21] alabaster books
[39:25] and don't be angry if I wash his feet
[39:31] with my tears
[39:33] and I dry them with my Here,
[39:39] my hair.
[39:42] You were there
[39:46] the night he found me.
[39:50] You did not feel what he felt when he
[39:54] wrapped his loving arms around me. And
[40:00] you don't know the cost of the Oyo.
[40:06] No, you don't know the cost of my
[40:12] prayers.
[40:14] And you don't know the cost
[40:19] of the oil.
[40:21] Am I alabaster?
[40:33] Oh, what a beautiful song that is this
[40:36] morning.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord's good. Can you say amen?
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand. And it's an
[40:43] honor to have brother Steve Clar here to
[40:45] speak for us this morning.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; He's in the house. He's in the house.
[40:50] What's your need today? Oh, he's in the
[40:53] house today.
[40:55] Amen.
[40:56] Please don't go home today without
[40:58] receiving your blessing that he has for
[41:00] you today.
[41:02] Ask and it shall be given to you. Seek
[41:05] and you shall find. Knock on his door
[41:07] today because he has something for you
[41:10] and I today. Hallelujah. Little girl was
[41:14] lying.
[41:17] Little girl was lying there for people
[41:22] sleeping.
[41:24] They just left in Jesus.
[41:28] She said she's only sleeping.
[41:32] As he took her by the hand,
[41:36] she begins to pray again.
[41:40] So begin to praise the Lord.
[41:44] So begin to sing
[41:48] in the house.
[41:51] Oh, death has to.
[41:54] And now there is life where darkness
[41:59] used to be. Now there is
[42:06] and there's no more. I will praise
[42:11] his name.
[42:13] Praise his name.
[42:17] He's in the house.
[42:23] We were like that labor.
[42:31] So Jesus touched this heart of mine and
[42:34] gave me life again.
[42:38] Now just a house to claim.
[42:42] Ever since that last day,
[42:46] there's a light that shines on me for
[42:49] all the world.
[43:04] Heat. Heat.
[43:14] Heat. Heat.
[43:24] Glorious.
[43:52] Father, we're so thankful, God.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; That you're in the building today.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we've come to receive from
[44:02] you. And
[44:05] &gt;&gt; we desire, Lord, that you open the word
[44:07] to us.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Let it not be a man standing here or
[44:12] reading this morning.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:16] Father, in myself, I have no good gift
[44:19] to give.
[44:21] But Lord, if you'll use the vessel and
[44:23] you will speak through us this morning,
[44:26] I believe Lord, the people can say like
[44:28] those Cleopus and his friend on the road
[44:31] to Emmas, they can say, "Didn't our
[44:34] hearts burn?"
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; He was talking with us along the way.
[44:39] Didn't our hearts
[44:41] &gt;&gt; didn't he open the word to us? Did he
[44:43] instill a little more something to the
[44:45] depths of our our being?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; So, Father, we're asking for this this
[44:52] morning, I pray.
[44:54] Father, we remember Brother Ron as he's
[44:56] away on a welldeserved vacation. I pray,
[44:59] Father, that you would bless him and
[45:01] Sister Sandy as they're resting.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And I pray, God, that there would be a
[45:06] special anointing wherever they are
[45:09] &gt;&gt; this Sunday. May your presence just
[45:10] overshadow them, Lord. And
[45:13] Oh, and just give them good rest. We
[45:15] pray.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Bless us in your divine presence now. We
[45:19] ask in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[45:22] church said,
[45:23] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I bring greetings
[45:28] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:30] Christ. And uh we're just so happy to be
[45:32] here. And I I was just really thankful
[45:35] brother Ron extended a invitation to us
[45:38] to come preach. And uh I take it such an
[45:41] honor. He's not here this morning and uh
[45:44] he's just had the
[45:46] the honor to allow me to stand here. So
[45:50] I'm just really thankful this morning.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; I see a lot of friends in the building
[45:54] today and amen. My special friend,
[45:56] Brother Don Saunders, God richly bless
[45:58] you. Brother Don was in Canada with us
[46:01] for a couple months and I got to see him
[46:03] an awful lot. And so uh God bless you,
[46:06] Brother Don, and my sister Rosanne and
[46:08] brother John McCaffrey. Good to have
[46:09] family in the house of God with us this
[46:11] morning.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Living with us and uh my
[46:14] son-in-law and my daughter. Amen. That
[46:17] they're here today with us. So, praise
[46:19] the Lord. I bring greetings to you from
[46:20] Brother John Andy's and Sister Sharon.
[46:23] And uh they love you and they appreciate
[46:25] you. And so all that really know them
[46:27] personally. Sister Sharon said, "Make
[46:29] sure that you tell all the sisters, God
[46:31] bless you."
[46:33] Well, um that's not possible. So, I
[46:36] bring greetings that way from the
[46:37] pulpit.
[46:38] th this morning. Praise the name of the
[46:41] Lord. A I'd like to sing one song with
[46:44] you if that's okay if we I have such
[46:47] gratitude to the Lord.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Do you have gratitude to the Lord this
[46:51] morning?
[46:52] &gt;&gt; I've asked brother Dubsy to help me and
[46:54] brother Robert to sing this song.
[46:56] Gratitude. Amen. All our words fall
[46:59] short.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; And all of us this morning have got
[47:03] nothing new.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Warren and
[47:06] brother Steve and all the other
[47:07] ministers. God bless you. We've got
[47:09] nothing to give to the Lord but our just
[47:12] a little Hallelujah.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe this morning all of us could just
[47:15] put ourselves forward and give ourselves
[47:18] to the Lord today.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Let's just not rely on the ministry. Why
[47:23] don't you say, "Lord, I got something to
[47:25] give. I I have come this morning to give
[47:28] of myself."
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Even if it's just a little hallelujah,
[47:32] Lord, that I want to give this morning.
[47:36] All my words fall short.
[47:42] I've caught nothing new.
[47:47] How could I express
[47:52] all my gratitude?
[47:58] I sing these songs
[48:03] as I often do.
[48:08] But
[48:10] the same
[48:14] but you never do. I'll sing it now.
[48:19] I throw up my hands to praise you again
[48:24] and again.
[48:27] Cuz all you have is a highle.
[48:39] And I know it's not much, but I'm
[48:43] nothing else good for a king
[48:47] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[48:55] Hallelujah.
[49:10] I got for you
[49:15] with my hands stretched wide.
[49:19] Lord, I worship you.
[49:23] Oh, so I throw in my hands. Let's
[49:28] worship in just a moment. We praise you
[49:32] cuz all I have is a highle.
[49:45] And I know it's not much, but I'm
[49:48] nothing else fit for a king
[49:53] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[50:01] So I throw up my hands.
[50:05] So I throw up my hands. Praise you again
[50:10] and again.
[50:13] Hallelujah.
[50:20] Hallelujah.
[50:25] I know it's not but I'm nothing else
[50:29] before
[50:35] singing high one more time. Oh I want to
[50:39] throw up my hands Lord. Oh God I want to
[50:42] give you praise this morning.
[50:46] Lord I give all to you this morning.
[50:50] Oh I want to praise you this morning. I
[50:53] want to give you a hallelujah. Praise
[50:56] your name. Glory be to God. Oh, this the
[50:59] least that I can do for you this
[51:02] morning. Oh, it's not much alone. I gave
[51:05] it to you this morning.
[51:08] Hell for a king.
[51:12] It's simp for a heart singing
[51:15] hallelujah.
[51:20] Would
[51:30] somebody in the house like to praise him
[51:32] this morning?
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Would there somebody like to lift your
[51:36] voice and say hallelujah? Praise your
[51:38] name. I give myself to you this morning,
[51:42] Father. It's really not much,
[51:46] but I give it anyhow to you. I lay
[51:48] before your altar. I leave it in your
[51:50] presence, Lord.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Praise you, Lord. Praise you. Praise
[51:57] you. Praise you, Lord.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[52:12] Hallelujah.
[52:15] Hallelujah.
[52:23] Hallelujah.
[52:30] Hallelujah.
[52:37] Hallelujah.
[52:45] Hallelujah.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus.
[53:06] Hallelujah.
[53:19] Speak to us now, Lord, by your word as
[53:21] we open the scripture.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Your presence is here this morning,
[53:27] Lord.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Anoint the hearer, Lord.
[53:39] May you open my tongue to speak this
[53:41] morning.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; I ask in the name of Jesus Christ.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you have your Bibles with you
[53:50] this morning?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; We'd like to turn to Judges uh sorry,
[53:54] Joshua chapter 6. Joshua chapter 6. And
[53:58] we're going to read one verse here and
[54:00] then you can have your seats.
[54:05] Joshua chapter 6 verse 20.
[54:12] When you have the scripture, will you
[54:13] say amen?
[54:17] &gt;&gt; So the people shouted when the priest
[54:20] blew the trumpets.
[54:22] And it came to pass when the people
[54:24] heard the sound of the trumpet,
[54:28] and the people shouted with a great
[54:30] shout,
[54:32] and the wall fell flat down.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that the people went up into
[54:38] the city, every man straight before him,
[54:42] and they took the city.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; That's a wonderful thought of scripture
[54:51] this morning.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; The walls came down.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; And they took the city.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; They took their inheritance.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many this morning could
[55:02] say, "I want to take my inheritance this
[55:04] morning." Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; The word of God has promised me an
[55:08] inheritance
[55:10] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take this word
[55:14] &gt;&gt; inside of my heart.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless the reading of this
[55:17] word. We can have our seats in the
[55:19] presence of God.
[55:23] Just to bring a a little context to the
[55:26] to the scripture this morning, the we
[55:29] see in Joshua chapter 6, we see the city
[55:33] of Jericho was it was entirely
[55:37] enclosed and they were an anticipation
[55:41] that there would be an attack from the
[55:43] Israelites.
[55:45] And God spoke to Joshua and and he told
[55:48] him, he said, "Now," he said, "I am
[55:50] going to provide the victory."
[55:54] &gt;&gt; I'm always thankful this morning when
[55:55] God does the speaking and he does the
[55:57] promising.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Before one brick or one piece of rock
[56:02] begin to move,
[56:05] &gt;&gt; the Lord had already spoken to Joshua
[56:07] and said that you will have the victory.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I look at our lives and I
[56:13] think of us individually and I don't
[56:15] know the battles and the struggles that
[56:18] you are all going through. But one thing
[56:21] I know that the book the Lord has
[56:23] promised us that we shall be overcomers.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; In the season that we're living in,
[56:30] we're so mentally uh bombarded and the
[56:34] prophet would speak a greatest battle
[56:36] ever fought. And we recognize today we
[56:40] are living in that time where there is
[56:42] such mental pressures.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; And there is a time where a a a pressure
[56:47] is coming upon the bride. And one thing
[56:50] we must be assured of in our hearts, not
[56:53] just under an intellectual conception,
[56:56] but we must have it within our hearts
[56:58] that we are victorious. Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And so the Lord has promised here in
[57:05] Joshua chapter 6 that that he would he
[57:08] would look after them and they would be
[57:10] victorious.
[57:12] And the Lord instructed the Israelite
[57:14] warriors now to march around the city
[57:18] one time for six days in a row. Now if
[57:22] you can imagine the the the toil, the
[57:25] struggle, the hardship it would be.
[57:27] We're not talking about now just
[57:29] marching around like the square footage
[57:31] of this auditorium.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; They had to with toil. They had to with
[57:37] great sweat and great pains. They had to
[57:40] march around the city one time for six
[57:44] days. And there would be seven priests
[57:47] there and they would be ready to blow
[57:50] the trumpets, that ram's horns. But the
[57:52] instruction now was there was no blowing
[57:55] of trumpet or there would be no shouting
[57:58] until the seventh day. And on that
[58:01] seventh day, now it wasn't just marching
[58:04] around one time, but now they had to
[58:07] march around seven times
[58:10] &gt;&gt; on the seventh day. And now we come to
[58:14] our our scripture. And the people
[58:17] shouted, a great shout, and the walls
[58:22] came down.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; You know, in my heart this morning, I
[58:26] have a shout.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; I I would say to the congregation this
[58:30] morning, can you say amen with a great
[58:33] shout?
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; You know, something in my heart is
[58:37] bubbling out. It's not something that
[58:38] any man has to instruct me to do to
[58:41] worship. That's right.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; It's not somebody that's got to say,
[58:46] "Will you praise God? Will will you lift
[58:48] your voice?" But something on the inside
[58:53] &gt;&gt; because I already know that there's a
[58:55] victory around been want
[58:57] &gt;&gt; and I'm more than a conqueror through
[59:00] Christ Jesus.
[59:02] Yeah.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Now, my thoughts this morning as a
[59:04] sermon title, if you'll just keep it in
[59:06] your heart, is you surround me with
[59:11] songs of deliverance.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And towards the end of this service, I
[59:17] hope to get to speak on the covenant of
[59:20] the shoe.
[59:22] Now, brother Brandon would say in a
[59:24] message in 1960 in Blind Barnameus, a
[59:27] short quotation, he would say, "By the
[59:30] people shouting and giving praise to
[59:33] God, the walls of Jericho fell down
[59:37] flat, one on top of the other." And then
[59:41] he says these words. He says, "A little
[59:44] shouting helps once in a while."
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning? Amen.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; My prophet,
[59:52] &gt;&gt; your prophet,
[59:55] &gt;&gt; he said, "A little shouting,
[59:57] &gt;&gt; will help once and a while."
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "It certainly does." And now
[1:00:04] after the walls of Jericho have fallen
[1:00:07] flat. Brother Brandham, in this next
[1:00:09] quotation, he dramatizes a reflection
[1:00:12] that Joshua might have had when this
[1:00:15] event happened. The walls came down. And
[1:00:17] I look at like if it was a little bit of
[1:00:19] a interview. Hey Joshua, what were you
[1:00:22] thinking? And he would sit back there
[1:00:24] and blind bother Brandon and say, "Every
[1:00:27] stone that I'm sitting on, the power of
[1:00:30] God took it off the wall."
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; The very stones begin to shake when the
[1:00:38] power of God begin to move.
[1:00:41] Now, let me make this statement to you,
[1:00:44] and I hope that you will agree with it
[1:00:46] because we're all message believers here
[1:00:48] this morning.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; But we recognize that there is not a
[1:00:52] stone large enough
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; or a wall that is built big enough
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; that faith in the word of God cannot
[1:01:02] move. Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; I believe that this morning
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; because I believe in the supernatural
[1:01:12] power of God.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; And I believe that supernatural power of
[1:01:17] God is tearing down walls
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; in our lives even this morning.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; If you come with a need upon your heart,
[1:01:26] the Lord Jesus can come right to your
[1:01:29] seat.
[1:01:31] We're not just talking about angelic
[1:01:33] beings now. We're talking about that
[1:01:35] mighty angel.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; That one that stood with his foot upon
[1:01:39] the land and the other upon the sea with
[1:01:41] the rainbow above his head that gave us
[1:01:44] his word in this hour. That same one,
[1:01:47] that mighty conqueror, he's in the
[1:01:49] building this morning.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; And by supernatural power, he can take
[1:01:54] down every stone and every wall
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; that's ever been built up in our life.
[1:01:59] Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about this word called
[1:02:03] dunamis power.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; And dunamis power is a special word.
[1:02:08] It's used throughout the scripture about
[1:02:10] 117 times in the New Testament. And it
[1:02:14] means to have an unstoppable
[1:02:17] supernatural power that flows from you.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; An unstoppable force.
[1:02:28] I'm talking to every brother this
[1:02:30] morning. I'm talking to every sister.
[1:02:33] I'm talking to those that are at the age
[1:02:35] of accountability that have given their
[1:02:37] life to Jesus Christ. And may I remind
[1:02:40] you of the scripture that gives us the
[1:02:42] proof that the power of God is on the
[1:02:44] inside of us. And that is in Acts 1:8.
[1:02:48] And ye shall receive power.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; We're talking about supernatural power.
[1:02:56] Not just speaking about gifting this
[1:02:58] morning. We're talking about
[1:03:00] supernatural power of God. And the
[1:03:02] scripture says after the Holy Ghost has
[1:03:05] come upon you.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; So it's not just ordinary power.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; I like to use these words. Words are
[1:03:13] powerful.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; This power we're talking about is
[1:03:17] explosive.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; This power
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; that you and I know of is lifealtering.
[1:03:25] Yes.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; When we received God's life, we never
[1:03:32] were the same again.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; It's It's not just a little feeling or a
[1:03:38] touch that we might have felt in a
[1:03:40] breeze that made us feel a little good
[1:03:42] in the service. This is lifealtering. I
[1:03:47] will never be the same. Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Not only am I not the same, but I need a
[1:03:53] strength in this hour.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And it's sustaining strength
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; that comes to us daily.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; His mercy is new every morning. And as I
[1:04:06] get up every morning and consecrate my
[1:04:08] life to him and I ask him to move in my
[1:04:11] life, it is the Holy Ghost power of God
[1:04:14] that directs me and sustains me and
[1:04:18] moves me in the right direction.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Cannot be of myself.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; This is what we know to be the
[1:04:26] quickening power in Romans 8:1. that
[1:04:31] quickening power that raised Jesus
[1:04:34] Christ from the grave.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Now I I also want us to see that this
[1:04:41] dynamo power, this dynamic power is not
[1:04:44] just for miracles.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Many times we think about dunamis power
[1:04:50] and we think about miracles,
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; but it's everyday living for me.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Every moment. Can you testify with me of
[1:04:59] that?
[1:05:00] Every moment of our day is a miracle.
[1:05:04] It's deliverance from mental battles.
[1:05:07] It's power to march. We're talking about
[1:05:10] now marching seven times around Jericho.
[1:05:14] It is the power every single day to put
[1:05:17] the boots on your feet and begin to
[1:05:19] march for the glory of God.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; But here is the paradox.
[1:05:25] Unbelievable but true. It comes this
[1:05:28] power. It comes by a still small voice.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes we look for the
[1:05:38] thunderouses.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; We look for the earthquakes. We want
[1:05:42] everything to shake around us.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; But it comes by a still small voice.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; And you know it, brothers. You know it,
[1:05:51] sisters, that tenderly speaks to you.
[1:05:54] That's
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Speaks into your heart. Can you can you
[1:05:59] know that understanding
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; that he speaks to your heart and he says
[1:06:04] words like this? I will be with you
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; even in you to the end.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; How about this one? Greater is he that
[1:06:16] is inside of you
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. Amen.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Now, in our text, God has instructed
[1:06:26] Joshua and the people to shout
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; and the people shouted with a great
[1:06:33] shout and the walls came falling flat.
[1:06:38] Now, if you think about it for a moment,
[1:06:40] Israel, that was a multitude of people
[1:06:44] and their shout was very great. Can you
[1:06:48] imagine? and put this use your
[1:06:49] imagination cell for for good use. Think
[1:06:52] of it now. You got 40,000 men
[1:06:56] and they all shout at one time.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the sh sound waves that
[1:07:04] would
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Now let's do a little exercise. Would
[1:07:07] you like to exercise for just a moment?
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Now I look around the building and I I
[1:07:13] would say there's a few hundred people
[1:07:14] in the building this morning. I would
[1:07:17] want in a one, two, three, all of us to
[1:07:19] say amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Would that be okay?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; One, two, three.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Now, that was a shout.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; But can you imagine 40,000 men
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; making a shout?
[1:07:40] You know, in 2023 in Seattle where our
[1:07:43] area, they had a music cont uh uh
[1:07:47] concert and and the person that was
[1:07:49] singing the people and the songs and the
[1:07:51] movement, the clapping and all that was
[1:07:53] going on, they made such noise that it
[1:07:56] registered on the recctor scale for
[1:07:59] earthquakes at 2.3 of a magnitude.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; The place begin to move.
[1:08:07] But I want you to notice when they all
[1:08:10] shouted together, the stadium didn't
[1:08:13] come down.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; So I begin to think in my heart, it has
[1:08:19] nothing to do with our vocal cords
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; or our enthusiasm.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; The sound waves that came from Israel's
[1:08:28] trumpets and shouts, well, they shook
[1:08:32] and I'm sure the walls begin to tremble.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want you to see this. This
[1:08:37] is very important to me. It was going to
[1:08:40] take much more
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; than noise
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; to bring the walls down.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, throughout the
[1:08:50] message, your readers just like I am.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham gives us a license to
[1:08:56] shout. He gives us a license to praise
[1:08:59] the Lord. We ought to shout.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; And he says it would do us some real
[1:09:03] good,
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; right? But now, let me repeat myself.
[1:09:09] It's going to take a supernatural faith
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; in the word of God to bring the walls
[1:09:17] down of Satan.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to encourage you today with
[1:09:24] your supernatural faith.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would and I just say
[1:09:28] this shortly. Brother Brandham as an
[1:09:30] example would speak of a little acorn.
[1:09:32] And I have one on the screen for you. An
[1:09:34] acorn has all of the potential of being
[1:09:39] that oak tree,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; but it's in seed form,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; and the seed just needs to be encouraged
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; to push out and drink.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Push out and drink.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; And we this morning have all been
[1:09:58] birthed by the power of God. And it's my
[1:10:02] desire to encourage you to take the word
[1:10:05] of God, the supernatural power of God,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; and drink it in
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; and push out.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Drink it in and push out and we will
[1:10:16] inherit
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; the land.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 11:30, it says, "By faith,
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; the walls of Jericho fell
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; down."
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; It was after they compassed seven days,
[1:10:35] they did the word of the Lord. The
[1:10:37] command is we must do the word of the
[1:10:40] Lord. If they missed one day of
[1:10:43] marching, friends, they were not doing
[1:10:45] the word of the Lord. March seven days
[1:10:49] of faith believing in the promise of God
[1:10:52] that said possession is your
[1:10:55] inheritance.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; The bride, we are the bride.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; We are the last age
[1:11:04] and we are possessing
[1:11:07] the gates of the enemy.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to encourage you this
[1:11:10] morning, if you're a little light on the
[1:11:12] possession this morning, let's take it
[1:11:14] by faith and clothe ourselves in the
[1:11:17] word of God once again and realize that
[1:11:20] we are possessing the gates of the
[1:11:22] enemy. We've won the battle.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; For the battle is not ours, it is the
[1:11:28] Lord's.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; But each age, now we're talking about
[1:11:32] the each age, had to march for their
[1:11:35] day. And we could see the Ephesian
[1:11:38] church age and the Sardian church age
[1:11:40] and Pergamos there on the screen I have
[1:11:43] for you a small picture maybe and
[1:11:45] thyroyus and sardis in Philadelphia.
[1:11:48] They all w marched one day
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; for their season
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; and each marched around. And I want you
[1:11:58] to notice there was no shouting.
[1:12:02] It was a march
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; in the heat of the day. They marched
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; through the dark ages. They marched.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; They took the Bibles. They took the
[1:12:14] written word of God out of the people's
[1:12:16] hands.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; And they had those that were committed
[1:12:20] to the writings of the scripture. They
[1:12:22] were called murmurous. And they would
[1:12:24] take a portion of scripture by memory
[1:12:26] and they would keep it in their mind
[1:12:28] aresh. And once it came to the time
[1:12:31] where the Bible could come forth again,
[1:12:33] they came together and they repeated the
[1:12:36] words to put it back into script so that
[1:12:39] you and I have a Bible this morning.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Can can I give you a little admonishment
[1:12:46] this morning? It's good to read your
[1:12:48] Bible.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; So each one of them marched for their
[1:12:53] day. But there was a seventh day, the
[1:12:57] fullness of time. The promise of the
[1:12:59] word would be open and they would march
[1:13:02] seven times around the wall. And at that
[1:13:05] seventh time, there would be a a a
[1:13:08] jubilee and a time of rejoicing because
[1:13:11] freedom would come and God would break
[1:13:13] down every wall.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; The march of seven, of completion. We
[1:13:19] know this as believers just instilling
[1:13:21] it back into our hearts. The seventh day
[1:13:23] they marched, it wasn't easy.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; How many thinks that this lady will see
[1:13:29] an age is easy?
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Now, this is a a tough day. It's been a
[1:13:34] hardest day than they ever had.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; We talked about mind battles. You know,
[1:13:39] you know, to do good, but evil is
[1:13:41] present. Paul says
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; there's a constant battle. The only
[1:13:46] thing that helps us to know that the
[1:13:48] spirit of God is on the inside of us
[1:13:50] leading and guiding us into all truth.
[1:13:52] And brother Brandon would use that
[1:13:54] example of the old Indian that would
[1:13:55] talk about which one would dog you'd
[1:13:57] feed the most, the white or the black
[1:13:59] dog. How many remembers? And the little
[1:14:01] old Indian said, "Well, it's whatever
[1:14:02] dog I feed the most." And the Holy
[1:14:05] Spirit is, he's communicating to us,
[1:14:07] encouraging us today, saying, "Feed the
[1:14:10] good. Feed the white. Feed the word."
[1:14:13] Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; And keep marching.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; You know, you need rhythm.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; You need rhythm to march. You need
[1:14:23] rhythm to to to run.
[1:14:27] How many long-distance runners will we
[1:14:29] have in the building this morning?
[1:14:32] I know there's one sister in the
[1:14:33] building. I don't know if she'd want me
[1:14:34] to call her name, but she's a she's a
[1:14:36] runner.
[1:14:38] I think her last name would be Lavo.
[1:14:41] She's a blonde sister.
[1:14:44] Brother Jesse's a good husband.
[1:14:47] So, you know, runners when they run,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; they have to
[1:14:54] pace themselves.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; They have to learn how to breathe.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Now, as you could tell, I'm not a
[1:15:02] runner. Praise God. I'm an eater.
[1:15:10] But runners know how to pace themselves.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; We are spiritual runners.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; We've taken the baton and we're running
[1:15:18] the last rep
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; lap.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And we'd have to know that we have to
[1:15:24] breathe appropriately.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Do you know I believe this is how you
[1:15:28] breathe appropriately.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; You breathe faith
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; in through your nostrils
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; and supernatural
[1:15:39] out of your mouth.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Faith in,
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; supernatural out. This is the life of
[1:15:45] the believer.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Faith in the word of God, supernatural
[1:15:49] out.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; And as we're running, we recognize that
[1:15:52] we have to breathe properly. If we don't
[1:15:54] breathe properly, we're going to get a
[1:15:56] stitch in your side.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; You're you're going to find yourself in
[1:16:00] problems. You're going to be exhausted.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; But God says, you know what? Breathe
[1:16:06] properly. Breathe in the word,
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; then proclaim. You talk about
[1:16:11] supernatural, I'm not just speaking
[1:16:13] about winds. I'm speaking about hands
[1:16:16] and feet of people doing the same work
[1:16:19] that Jesus did. The scripture preaches
[1:16:22] and says, "Proclaim and prophesy."
[1:16:24] Again,
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; we've had the mighty angel come
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; and brought a message to an earthly
[1:16:30] angel, Brother Brandham. And he's
[1:16:32] proclaimed the word to us. Revelations
[1:16:35] 10:7 is fulfilled. But there's a portion
[1:16:38] for us to do and that is to breathe the
[1:16:41] word in by faith
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; and work your life out in the
[1:16:45] supernatural. Breathe it out. Let the
[1:16:48] word live.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; This is a new day.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; We don't want to get complicated this
[1:16:55] morning, but this is a new day. We speak
[1:16:57] of it being the eighth day or the day of
[1:16:59] the Lord with things begin to move.
[1:17:04] And I encourage you this morning. Let's
[1:17:06] reach our potential.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like to move forward in our
[1:17:12] progression of thought. Now, we we
[1:17:14] talked about shouting, and it's not just
[1:17:15] something that we do to make noise, but
[1:17:17] it's supernatural faith. And and so, now
[1:17:20] we read in Psalms 32:7,
[1:17:23] it says here that now as the psalmist is
[1:17:26] writing, he's proclaiming to the Lord,
[1:17:28] "Thou art my hiding place.
[1:17:34] Thou shalt preserve me from trouble,
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt compass me about with
[1:17:42] songs of deliverance.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Those words compass, it's round about.
[1:17:47] It's moving about. It's a movement. Thou
[1:17:50] shalt compass me about with songs of
[1:17:54] deliverance.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Now, a song. If you stay with me just
[1:17:58] for a minute, a song. We heard some.
[1:18:01] Thank you for singing those beautiful
[1:18:03] songs this morning. I I really is
[1:18:04] blessed.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; A song is near and dear to you, isn't
[1:18:07] it?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Most people will say, I'll get up and
[1:18:10] sing a song if it's something that works
[1:18:12] in my life or I feel something in my
[1:18:14] heart to sing about because it's an
[1:18:16] internal expression.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; It's a prophetic word or a glorification
[1:18:23] of the Lord. The Hebrew word, and not to
[1:18:27] get entangled in Hebrew words, but the
[1:18:29] Hebrew Hebrew word for songs is ran,
[1:18:33] which means to give a ringing cry
[1:18:39] from the inside. A ringing cry. Now,
[1:18:42] that word deliverance in Hebrew is
[1:18:45] Yeshua, which speaks of an action of
[1:18:48] redemption and salvation and liberation.
[1:18:53] But this is where I get excited. Maybe
[1:18:55] you'll get excited with me.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Deliverance also speaks of a formal a
[1:19:02] formal authoritative utterance.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; A formal.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm serving you notice.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; You know, someone ever show served you
[1:19:17] notice from the court, it gets your
[1:19:19] attention. Right?
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; I'm serving you a notice.
[1:19:24] So now, if you'll put songs of
[1:19:27] deliverance together, what you'll get is
[1:19:30] resounding cries of a formal authority.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; My goodness, how does that fit in the
[1:19:37] scripture, Brother Steve? Well, here
[1:19:39] goes. Jesus said to Satan with a formal
[1:19:42] authority
[1:19:44] what it is written.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself used his own words
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; against the enemy.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus gave notice to Satan at the
[1:19:57] cross a formal authority to say these
[1:20:00] words. It is complete. It is finished.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; The work that I'm done. It is finished.
[1:20:06] Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; So notice how does that work together
[1:20:09] with us? Well, we're in our sunship.
[1:20:12] We're in our placing.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; We're son adopted sons of God.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; And that places us in authority to use a
[1:20:22] formal authority.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Who are we g using against? Not each
[1:20:27] other.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Right? It seems like in church people
[1:20:30] like to use a formal authority against
[1:20:32] one another. No. No. That's not what it
[1:20:34] is. Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; We're serving notice against the enemy.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Well, we have this authority through the
[1:20:43] atonement that's made way for a
[1:20:44] redemption and redemption has made way
[1:20:47] for our sunship. And now we have a new
[1:20:50] song to sing.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; We are a people that have a new song of
[1:20:55] deliverance. And I believe it starts
[1:20:57] like this. We are hes of the father.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are hes through Christ Jesus.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; We are hes with the son. We are that one
[1:21:10] that Christ in us as adopted sons and
[1:21:14] daughters of God. Carry the ring upon
[1:21:17] the our finger saying whatever you say.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's time to stop crying so much.
[1:21:24] We're whining and crying and fing. Stop
[1:21:27] that whining and crying and use the
[1:21:30] authoritative word against the enemy.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would use these words.
[1:21:37] Satan can't hold it if you go to him
[1:21:40] with spiritual authority word
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; with faith and say it is mine.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. I
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; I wonder just a moment if you could
[1:21:51] think in your heart if there's a
[1:21:53] pressing need in your heart. Maybe a
[1:21:55] family member that's gone astray. Or
[1:21:57] maybe there's something that's happening
[1:21:58] in your home that Satan's trying to to
[1:22:00] build a wall or destroy in your home. I
[1:22:03] wonder if just now you could put it in
[1:22:05] your heart and say, "Satan, I serve
[1:22:07] notice."
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And the word says, "This promise
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; is mine."
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say, "Get him
[1:22:17] running. Lay it down because we have
[1:22:20] come with a spiritual authority. I'm a
[1:22:23] believer. These are words that we ought
[1:22:26] to speak vocally.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; All right. Does anybody ever drive down
[1:22:31] the road and the enemy come and bombard
[1:22:32] them in their mind?
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. It's just Brother Steve. I don't
[1:22:37] know. When I drive down the road and let
[1:22:39] me tell you, I get hammered sometimes.
[1:22:43] And sometimes I don't know where the
[1:22:44] next thing is coming. My mind is all
[1:22:46] over the place. May maybe someone said
[1:22:48] something or maybe something done in my
[1:22:50] life and I brother Robert I just I feel
[1:22:52] like I'm a basket case
[1:22:56] but all of a sudden something reminds me
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; you have an authoritative word.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Why are you letting this guy talk to
[1:23:06] you?
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; And we have to use our words cuz Satan
[1:23:11] needs to hear your voice.
[1:23:15] I rebuke you Satan in the name of Jesus
[1:23:18] Christ. I come against you with the
[1:23:20] authority of the word.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; So with people of God, we got to hold
[1:23:26] our position.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Hold our position and cry out with this
[1:23:30] authoritative utterance.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You know, David, this is before the Holy
[1:23:35] Ghost came. David, the anointing was so
[1:23:37] fresh upon him that when Saul was having
[1:23:41] a a demon spirit upon him, an
[1:23:43] oppression, David
[1:23:46] by inspiration, yet not the Holy Spirit
[1:23:49] there for the day, but under inspiration
[1:23:52] begin to play songs that delivered Saul.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[1:24:00] want.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; You got to quote the word. Yeah,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; you got to use your word.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; That's why we preach so hard. I know,
[1:24:07] brother Ron. He encourages us all to
[1:24:11] read our Bibles, know what the word
[1:24:13] said. He encourages us to read the
[1:24:15] message, friend, because that is what's
[1:24:18] going to get us through. And when we
[1:24:20] sing these words back, it's a new song,
[1:24:22] a song of deliverance. It's a meaning
[1:24:26] from our heart. It's prophetic. And when
[1:24:29] I quote the word back to the enemy,
[1:24:31] something takes hold inside of me.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Suddenly I have a courage.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Suddenly I'm just there to say, "Oh,
[1:24:40] where's that cat?" How many remembers
[1:24:41] that story brother Brandon tells about
[1:24:43] that mouse and the cat? They were cha mc
[1:24:45] cat was chasing the the mouse and there
[1:24:48] around and around they were chasing the
[1:24:49] house and suddenly they got around the
[1:24:51] barrel and the mouse fell in the wine.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; And he got a little bit of stimulation.
[1:24:56] Yes, sir. And brother Brandham lets us
[1:24:58] know that we need the stimulation of
[1:25:00] revelation.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? Stimulation of
[1:25:04] revelation. The new song
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; on the inside of our heart. Not an old
[1:25:09] song. No, the new song of revelation.
[1:25:12] The word for our day. And when he popped
[1:25:14] out of that barrel, he looked around,
[1:25:17] brother Ezra,
[1:25:18] and he said, "Where is that cat now? I'm
[1:25:21] ready to fight."
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; An authoritative utterance.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; We just read there in Psalms 32:7,
[1:25:35] David's expression, "Thou art my thou
[1:25:37] shalt compass me about with a ringing
[1:25:40] cry of deliverance." But now in Psalms
[1:25:42] 32:8, God gives a response.
[1:25:47] And the response says, "I will instruct
[1:25:51] thee."
[1:25:53] I have you. That's that word. I'll never
[1:25:54] leave you or forsake you. I I I'm going
[1:25:56] to go before you. I will instruct you
[1:26:00] and teach thee in the way that thou
[1:26:02] shalt go and I will guide thee with mine
[1:26:05] eye.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brando speaks a message that we
[1:26:09] could take hours on and enjoy about
[1:26:12] being a guide, the Holy Ghost guiding us
[1:26:15] and leading us. But the words here is I
[1:26:18] will instruct you. And brother Brandon
[1:26:20] in absolute says like this. Before you
[1:26:22] can have faith, remember we need faith.
[1:26:25] Before we can have faith, you've got to
[1:26:27] have something to have faith in.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; And what more can you trust faith in
[1:26:35] than the word
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; of the living God.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Now friend, when you're sick, you need
[1:26:44] to start trusting.
[1:26:46] When you got something going on you in
[1:26:48] your body and the doctor says to you,
[1:26:49] you're going to die and there's no help
[1:26:53] for you or you end up someplace in a
[1:26:55] mental hospital and you're confused.
[1:26:57] You've got to recognize in Hebrews 4:12,
[1:27:01] for the word of God is a quick and
[1:27:04] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:27:07] sword.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Peace piercing even to the dividing of
[1:27:11] sunder of the soul and the spirit and of
[1:27:14] the joints and the marrow and the
[1:27:17] discerner.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; I need a God that gives me discernment
[1:27:22] in this hour. Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; The rights and the wrongs and to know
[1:27:26] what's truth today and it's the
[1:27:28] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:27:30] intents of the heart.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; We have a new song to sing.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; You know the next part of our song we
[1:27:40] already said that we are joined with the
[1:27:43] father. There's a next part I'd like to
[1:27:45] bring to you that we could sing.
[1:27:47] Whatever you ask in my name, I will do
[1:27:52] it.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; You're a joint heir. Whatever you say,
[1:27:57] you're going to it's going to come to
[1:27:58] pass. And these words that we use are
[1:28:01] shouted loudly. And we sing this new
[1:28:05] song with an authoritative cry.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; You know my prayer be today. I have
[1:28:09] prayers while I preach. I say, Lord, I
[1:28:12] and I have prayers. So I I wrote down in
[1:28:14] my study, Lord, what would be my prayer?
[1:28:18] My prayer, Lord,
[1:28:22] help me to take the word and sing it
[1:28:25] out.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And let there be a new song come out out
[1:28:30] of my life so that around me can see the
[1:28:35] glory of God shine through me. Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Remember when Moses met the burning bush
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; and he had that burning bush experience
[1:28:43] and he came walking down the mountain?
[1:28:46] His face shone like the sun
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; that that they had to take a a cloth and
[1:28:52] put it over because it was too bright.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; My prayer with the Holy Ghost upon us
[1:28:57] today is that my life shine that way and
[1:29:00] it may never depart. with Moses, it kind
[1:29:03] of departed after some time. But in my
[1:29:05] life,
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; young people in your life,
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; could it be that you'll go to your
[1:29:10] schools now? Now it's coming to fall. Or
[1:29:12] you'll go to the malls or you go
[1:29:14] wherever you go and the glory of God is
[1:29:17] so upon your life that all they can see
[1:29:20] is Jesus.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] So, so far we've mentioned today that
[1:29:28] there's been a command to shout and to
[1:29:30] bring down the walls. Shout with
[1:29:32] authoritative words for what purpose?
[1:29:36] For deliverance and inheritance.
[1:29:40] So, let's move forward if we can just
[1:29:42] for a few more minutes in our thought.
[1:29:44] Would that be okay? Amen.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; So
[1:29:50] in
[1:29:52] in Joshua chapter 6,
[1:29:55] we recognize that God told him go. But
[1:29:58] in Joshua chapter 5, if we stay there
[1:30:02] just for a m minute, we recognize it's
[1:30:04] the account where Joshua meets with the
[1:30:08] captain of the host.
[1:30:11] And and this is very symbolic and it's
[1:30:14] very important for us because uh we want
[1:30:17] to know that that Joshua he was there
[1:30:20] and he was wondering how he was going to
[1:30:22] take the land
[1:30:25] and he was pondering. Now sometimes we
[1:30:27] make our our Bible characters
[1:30:30] superheroes but he was really in a place
[1:30:32] of what am I going to do?
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; We've crossed into this land.
[1:30:38] Now I'm looking over the hill and now
[1:30:42] there's this walled city. How are we
[1:30:45] going to get into that place?
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; I think that you've looked at your walls
[1:30:50] in your life,
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; places in your in your life and you have
[1:30:54] no idea how the outcome's going to be.
[1:30:57] Like you are absolutely Lord, I just got
[1:31:00] to trust you. I don't know.
[1:31:05] So in Joshua 5:13, we see Joshua, he met
[1:31:09] the warrior Dawn, and Joshua calls on,
[1:31:12] "Are you for us or are you against us?"
[1:31:16] In verse 14, he said, "Nay, but I am the
[1:31:19] captain of the host of the Lord, and I
[1:31:22] am now come." Verse 15, "And the captain
[1:31:25] of the Lord's host said unto Joshua,
[1:31:28] loose thy shoe from off thy foot. Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; For the place whereon thou standest is
[1:31:37] holy.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; And Joshua did so.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to tuck this in your
[1:31:43] heart just for a moment.
[1:31:46] The captain of the host said, "Loose
[1:31:50] thy shoe off your foot." Singular.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Do you read that?
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; It's not shoes.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; It's singular. Shoe. Now, tuck that in
[1:32:02] your heart for just a moment because
[1:32:04] there is a difference between singular
[1:32:07] and plural
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; of the foot and the feet.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; So, well, maybe I should just spoil it
[1:32:14] for you just cuz I don't want you all
[1:32:16] wandering in your minds. The covenant of
[1:32:19] deliverance
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; comes by the shoe
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; and the breaking down of strongholds and
[1:32:26] the possessing of redemption comes way
[1:32:28] all by the shoe.
[1:32:31] But first, I want you to catch this that
[1:32:35] you already know, but I'm just
[1:32:36] pretending you don't.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to see it like this. This was
[1:32:40] no ordinary angel.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would tell us in Israel
[1:32:45] in the church 5, he said, "He met Jesus
[1:32:48] face to face, the captain of the host of
[1:32:51] the Lord."
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; So here Joshua didn't just meet an
[1:32:55] ordinary angel. He met Jesus in
[1:32:58] theophony form. Right?
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; And there he stood. Now to Moses, Jesus
[1:33:03] appeared in a burning bush for him.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; We would see God in progression. We
[1:33:09] would see him of God above us leading
[1:33:11] pillar of fire by by night and clout by
[1:33:14] day. We would see God with us and Jesus,
[1:33:16] the manifestation of the word upon the
[1:33:18] earth. And then at the day of Pentecost,
[1:33:20] we see Jesus in us. And we're walking
[1:33:22] right now with Jesus
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; on the inside of us.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's look at the command that
[1:33:29] Moses and Joshua were both given.
[1:33:33] Moses and Joshua were given similar
[1:33:36] commands. Well, let me help you remember
[1:33:38] in Exodus 3:5,
[1:33:41] you will see these words. And he said to
[1:33:43] Moses, this is to Moses, draw not
[1:33:45] hither. Put off thy shoes
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; off thy feet, for the place where on
[1:33:53] thou standest is holy ground. So in
[1:33:56] Joshua's ministry,
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus speaks and he says to him as the
[1:34:02] angel, "Take off your shoe."
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And with Moses in the beginning out of
[1:34:08] the coming out of Egypt, he says, "Take
[1:34:11] off your shoes."
[1:34:14] Now in Moses ministry, it was the
[1:34:16] calling out, "Come out of Egypt. Come
[1:34:19] out of Egypt, and I'm going to take you
[1:34:21] to the land of promise. Come out. I've
[1:34:23] called you out and I want you to lay
[1:34:26] bare before me. This is nothing, Moses,
[1:34:29] you're going to do. So, you're going to
[1:34:30] come humbly. You're going to take off
[1:34:32] your shoes and you're going to be
[1:34:35] instructed by me. I've heard the cries
[1:34:38] of my people for 400 years. And I have
[1:34:41] now come down. I have come down to
[1:34:44] deliver them.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; And Moses, it's time for you to
[1:34:48] mobilize. It's time for you to do your
[1:34:50] job. It's time for you to go forward as
[1:34:52] I command thee. So, we see Moses walking
[1:34:57] as one that is just in pure leadership
[1:35:00] of God.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; It's like Jesus when he was upon the
[1:35:04] earth. He said, "I do nothing unless my
[1:35:06] father first shows me." And Moses was
[1:35:08] that type of Christ to the people. So,
[1:35:11] Moses just walked forward and and we
[1:35:14] realize there is a coming out of Egypt
[1:35:16] and a going into the promised land. Very
[1:35:19] important. Come out of her, my people.
[1:35:21] And there's a going in. Pause here just
[1:35:24] for a moment.
[1:35:25] Moses, my servant, is dead. Joshua is
[1:35:28] the new commission of ministry. And we
[1:35:30] look at ourselves as our prophet that
[1:35:32] has come. And the Lord blessed and led
[1:35:34] him and he was led and guide, opened the
[1:35:36] word to us. But our service, brother
[1:35:38] servant, brother Brandham is dead. Who
[1:35:40] is leading us today?
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost, our Joshua.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; We're not looking to another eighth
[1:35:46] messenger. We're not looking to another
[1:35:48] man. We have wonderful ministries. We
[1:35:51] have wonderful men leading us. But it's
[1:35:53] the Holy Ghost, the dunamis power of God
[1:35:56] that's leading the church today under a
[1:35:59] Joshua ministry.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Now, under Moses's administration,
[1:36:05] Moses, he sent out 12 spies, remember
[1:36:07] that? To the land to survey the land.
[1:36:10] And 10, the majority brought a negative
[1:36:13] report. What did they say? We can't take
[1:36:16] it. we just can't do it.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; And two brought a positive report, a
[1:36:20] proof saying, "Hey, we can take the
[1:36:23] land.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; It's ours." I know that we look like
[1:36:26] grasshoppers and they're giants, but
[1:36:28] we've already it's already been given to
[1:36:30] us. All we got to do is take it.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; And that was a Joshua and Caleb nature
[1:36:37] that's represented in the bride today.
[1:36:39] We can take this land.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say, "Take it."
[1:36:44] God's promise to you joy, brother. All
[1:36:46] you have to do is take it.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; You know, he he says like this. He isn't
[1:36:51] going to poke it down your neck. How
[1:36:52] many's here that Brother Brandham say
[1:36:53] that? He's not going to poke it down
[1:36:55] your neck. You've got to take the land.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; But under the Moses administration,
[1:37:01] two million of them listened to 10
[1:37:05] negative reports.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And they did not take the land. They
[1:37:10] wandered for 40 years. But now here in
[1:37:14] Joshua chapter 5, God has bringing them
[1:37:17] into full circle. Now they're back and
[1:37:21] here they are. And Joshua now sends also
[1:37:25] spies. But he doesn't send all 12. He
[1:37:28] sends two. And they under this new
[1:37:32] administration, they go into the land to
[1:37:35] see what they can possess of the land.
[1:37:38] Remember they've got that Joshua Caleb
[1:37:40] spirit. We can take the land.
[1:37:43] But I want to stop here for just a
[1:37:45] minute. Whose land was this that they
[1:37:47] were going to take?
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; It was the Canaanites.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Now, if you go back in your scriptures,
[1:37:54] the Canaanites
[1:37:56] were not of any promise of the land.
[1:38:00] In fact, you remember they were cursed
[1:38:03] by God because Noah, remember the story
[1:38:06] of Noah in Genesis ch uh uh chapter 9,
[1:38:09] Ham had looked upon his father's
[1:38:11] nakedness and when he did so, there was
[1:38:13] a curse that was placed on Ham's seed.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Under no circumstance
[1:38:22] was an Israelite to marry a Canaanite, a
[1:38:25] Jebusite, or the itites that were
[1:38:27] following." And all along through the
[1:38:30] scriptures, oh, Abraham was looking for
[1:38:32] a a a a a wife for his his son Isaac.
[1:38:37] And Abraham said to Eleazaria, "Promise
[1:38:40] me
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; that you won't take a daughter from the
[1:38:43] Canaanites."
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Go to my family.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Go take a a bride and be brought back
[1:38:50] Rebecca back. So God was very determined
[1:38:53] that no Canaanite
[1:38:56] was to marry an Israelite.
[1:38:59] Then we find out further in the
[1:39:00] scriptures, just to save time, just to
[1:39:02] paraphrase, we find out that Joseph, you
[1:39:04] know, he he's he he's sold into slavery.
[1:39:08] Then suddenly in in in in in Genesis
[1:39:11] chapter 37, in the midst of the story of
[1:39:14] Joseph, we break into the story of
[1:39:17] Judah.
[1:39:19] And we find out the story of Judah and
[1:39:21] Tamar. And we see that Judah had married
[1:39:26] a Canaanite wife.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. That was against the
[1:39:31] word.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; God had said, "You never should take a
[1:39:34] Canaanite." And so he gave Tamar, which
[1:39:37] of the household of Israel, he gave her
[1:39:39] to his first son, Judah, did. And what
[1:39:42] happened? That son died.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Right? Then there's called the law of
[1:39:47] leverage where now the the the wife or
[1:39:50] the brother had to make
[1:39:53] be with the the the brother and she
[1:39:55] takes him and together they go to he
[1:39:57] dies.
[1:39:58] Now there's one son left
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; and they're all Canaanites
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; from Judah's wife.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; But God had said and promised there
[1:40:09] shall be no Canaanite marry an
[1:40:11] Israelite.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; So here we go. We find Tamar. She makes
[1:40:15] herself out to look like someone of
[1:40:17] illreute. And it was it was through the
[1:40:20] lust of Judah's heart that he found her.
[1:40:23] And he went to her. And we know the
[1:40:25] story. And I want to fast forward the
[1:40:26] story. Now she has pregnantated. She's
[1:40:29] got children. And on the inside of the
[1:40:32] scripture tells her that there's twins.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; But this is amazing to me because God
[1:40:38] will have a pure line and his word will
[1:40:40] be fulfilled. Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Now, as she's giving birth, one of the
[1:40:44] little fellas, he pokes out his arm and
[1:40:47] they whim the midwives quickly tie a
[1:40:50] string upon his arm because according to
[1:40:53] the law, whoever comes out first or
[1:40:55] whatever part that comes out first is
[1:40:58] the firstborn.
[1:41:00] So out comes his arm. The string was
[1:41:02] tied around its arm. That little child
[1:41:04] pulls it back into the womb and out
[1:41:07] comes the firstborn which is Perez, but
[1:41:10] he has no string around his arm. Next
[1:41:13] comes his brother L. I think his name is
[1:41:15] Lent. And he comes out of the womb. Now
[1:41:18] he's got the string. He is noted now to
[1:41:20] be the firstborn. Now according to the
[1:41:23] law of leverage, the firstb son had to
[1:41:26] go towards the Canaanite lineage.
[1:41:31] But Perez
[1:41:33] coming forth, he went after the nature
[1:41:36] of Judah and the line. You read it in
[1:41:38] Matthew chapter 1, he went forward and
[1:41:41] he became of the household that brought
[1:41:44] forth Jesus. So God through all of this
[1:41:47] trouble and struggle and mental cross
[1:41:50] the hands just like he did by the
[1:41:51] forefathers and he made it possible that
[1:41:54] through the law of leverage that one
[1:41:55] would go towards the Canaanites. He
[1:41:57] would not be regarded in the household
[1:41:59] of Israel and the other would go forward
[1:42:02] knowing that our Lord Jesus would come
[1:42:04] through that line.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Great pains God took
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; to keep the Canaanites, the Amorites,
[1:42:10] the Jebusites out of the house of
[1:42:11] Israel. Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Now, we find out then that there is a jo
[1:42:15] uh Joseph when he was in Egypt, he knew
[1:42:17] Pharaoh and Pharaoh knew him and he was
[1:42:19] second in command. But there came a time
[1:42:21] where there was a Pharaoh that would
[1:42:23] arise that knew not the Lord. How many
[1:42:25] remembers in your scriptures?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; And we see that Israel now is there as a
[1:42:29] people and they are under task masters.
[1:42:33] And we say, "Oh, and they're crying, oh
[1:42:35] God, deliver us, deliver us." But there
[1:42:37] was a law in the land of Egypt that said
[1:42:40] there was not allowing of any mixed
[1:42:42] marriages. So God in his tender mercy
[1:42:45] had driven Israel into a situation where
[1:42:48] they only could bring forth of their own
[1:42:50] kind.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; And for 400 years, God built a nation.
[1:42:55] When Abram came out uh uh from his
[1:42:58] father, they were only maybe 70 people
[1:43:00] looking. God made the promise, this is
[1:43:02] your land. I'm going to give it to your
[1:43:03] people. But the but the the the cup of
[1:43:05] the Amorites and the Jebusites and the
[1:43:08] Canaanites, it's not full yet.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; And God, now this is a word brother
[1:43:12] Brandon would use for our time, but God
[1:43:14] used it in that time. It was the tender
[1:43:17] hand of Jehovah that was keeping the
[1:43:21] lineage, keeping the bloodline, keeping
[1:43:23] it all pure under the hardship. Oh Lord,
[1:43:26] come. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; But he was keeping the people in a place
[1:43:32] where they were pure line that they
[1:43:34] could leave the land and now move
[1:43:36] forward under the Moses administration.
[1:43:39] But the word of God said, I want you to
[1:43:41] separate.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Didn't we hear a message the prophet of
[1:43:44] God preached to us? Total separation
[1:43:47] from all unbelief.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; We are not to go and take out a
[1:43:51] denominational system of an ism. We have
[1:43:54] a law of the Lord to keep yourself pure
[1:43:56] before him. Not with the deeds of the
[1:43:58] nickels, not with the things that would
[1:44:00] so compass around us, but keep yourself
[1:44:03] in separation to the Lord.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; A total separ separation.
[1:44:10] I want you to notice this. This is just
[1:44:12] phenomenal to me. When I when the Lord
[1:44:14] placed this in tomorrow, are are you
[1:44:15] doing okay this morning? Yeah.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, Moses and the group,
[1:44:21] they marched and they marched, right?
[1:44:24] Round and round and round and they
[1:44:25] couldn't seem to get into the promised
[1:44:27] land. And then we find out that Moses,
[1:44:29] he struck the rock the second time. He
[1:44:31] should not have done that. And and and
[1:44:32] and it cost him his entrance into the
[1:44:34] promised land. But I want you to notice
[1:44:37] God did it for one purpose.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Can you think of it this for just a
[1:44:41] moment?
[1:44:42] There was a chosen seed that was sitting
[1:44:46] inside of Jericho walls
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; and she was not a Canaanite.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; She was a gentile.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; And if you want to notice this, that God
[1:44:59] had placed a little woman. Yes, I'm
[1:45:00] talking about Rahab the harlot.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; God had placed her in that city. Now, if
[1:45:06] 40 years beforehand they would have
[1:45:09] crossed over the Jordan into the
[1:45:12] promised land, friends, there would been
[1:45:14] no Rahab the harlot.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; There would not be a lineage bearer
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; down the lineage of Jesus Christ. But by
[1:45:24] fornowledge, God knew
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; that the people had to wander,
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; wander in the wilderness, crying unto
[1:45:34] him, "Wonder."
[1:45:36] Now, I'm sure the first church age,
[1:45:38] which would be the Ephesians church age,
[1:45:40] they wondered, "Lord, we have a we have
[1:45:42] all the word here. We have all the
[1:45:44] everything. We could just leave it.
[1:45:46] We're ready, Lord, for rapture." But
[1:45:48] yet, they still had to toil and struggle
[1:45:51] seven church ages to where we are. There
[1:45:53] was a journey hot terrible
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; but Hebrewsap 11:40 says like this God
[1:46:01] having provided some better thing
[1:46:03] hallelujah for us
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; that they without us they without us
[1:46:08] should not be made perfect.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; God saw us right here today.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; It's not by chance that we're all here
[1:46:17] today.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; It's not by chance that you came to hear
[1:46:20] a preacher today that comes from
[1:46:21] Washington. It's not by accident brother
[1:46:24] Ron needed a rest and went on vacation.
[1:46:26] It is by God's fornowledge and plan. All
[1:46:29] of your life is for by fornowledge and
[1:46:32] plan. If he did it for a little Rahab
[1:46:34] woman that was a prostitute.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; What can he do for you?
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Now I want to bring us back to our
[1:46:50] thoughts about the shoe. Remember
[1:46:53] the command now, the singular command to
[1:46:57] Joshua. Take off your shoe. Can I read
[1:47:00] it to you one more time? Joshua 5:15.
[1:47:03] And the captain of the host said unto
[1:47:05] Joshua, "Loose thy shoe off from off thy
[1:47:08] foot. One shoe
[1:47:11] off of one foot."
[1:47:14] So he's got a sandal on just to make it
[1:47:17] real and a sandal off. And he's standing
[1:47:20] there. How is it different from Moses?
[1:47:23] Because Moses was two shoes. Remembering
[1:47:26] that something special was going to
[1:47:28] happen under this administration. The
[1:47:31] captain of the host himself, the Lord
[1:47:33] Jesus, was standing there and presenting
[1:47:35] to him the covenant of the shoe. One
[1:47:38] shoe off and one shoe off. Presenting is
[1:47:43] the covenant of redemption.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:48] It was Moses to take them out of the
[1:47:50] land of Egypt. God already knew that
[1:47:51] coming out of her my people with the
[1:47:54] promise of going into a land.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; But Joshua also knew that he wasn't
[1:47:58] going to go into the land. And now under
[1:48:00] this administrative Joshua, he's asking
[1:48:04] the captain of the host is asking Joshua
[1:48:06] now to remove your shoe. And he's
[1:48:09] paralleling it now to what he was going
[1:48:11] to do in the book of Ruth chapter 4.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:17] Amen.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Boaz went up to the town gate. Now
[1:48:23] remember, Ruth already had come and
[1:48:26] in the night time and slipped herself
[1:48:27] beside Boaz
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; and made her attentious knows that she
[1:48:30] was really interested.
[1:48:34] And then she said these words, "Take the
[1:48:36] border of thy garment and cover me up."
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; We have said, "I'm really interested.
[1:48:41] Take the border of your word and cover
[1:48:43] me, Lord." Amen. Amen.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; But now there's got to be a redemption
[1:48:46] process.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; To take that old Moabitis.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; So Bose went up to the town gate and sat
[1:48:55] down there just as
[1:48:57] just as the guardian redeemer of Naomi
[1:49:01] and Ruth just came along. Remember the
[1:49:04] story? And Boas said, "Come over here,
[1:49:06] my friend, and sit down." And Boas then
[1:49:08] he also called 10 of the elders of the
[1:49:11] town and said, "Sit here, too." And they
[1:49:12] did so. And Boa said to the guardian
[1:49:14] redeemer, he said, "Now Naomi has come
[1:49:17] back and you can redeem her, but she
[1:49:20] also brought along a Mob Moabitis,
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:49:27] wow Naomi, she's selling a piece of land
[1:49:30] and it belongs to your relative Emma."
[1:49:34] So Boaz is you know showing the picture
[1:49:37] here and he continues and he said if you
[1:49:40] don't redeem it I will do so but if you
[1:49:43] do not tell me and so I know and and
[1:49:46] then the next one that is in line has
[1:49:49] you remember the story has the right to
[1:49:51] do the redeeming the next one. So Tob,
[1:49:53] he's the guardian. He says, "Oh, oh,
[1:49:56] I'll redeem it." Because he's thinking
[1:49:59] land,
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. An old woman. Boa said, "Okay, on
[1:50:04] this day, you'll buy the land from
[1:50:07] Naomi, but you will also acquire the
[1:50:10] Moabitis Ruth."
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Well, all of a sudden, hang on a second.
[1:50:14] I can't do that because if I do that,
[1:50:17] redeem it, it might endanger my own
[1:50:19] estate. Because remember the law of
[1:50:21] leverage.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; The firstborn would have been have to
[1:50:27] given towards
[1:50:29] Ruth's first husband.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; That wasn't good. He wanted the land for
[1:50:33] himself. It would part it up. No. No. We
[1:50:35] don't want to do that.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; So verse, are you with me? Did I lose
[1:50:39] anybody? So Ruth 4:7 it says, "Now this
[1:50:44] this was the the manner in former time
[1:50:46] of Israel concerning the redeeming and
[1:50:48] the concerning the changing for to
[1:50:51] confirm all things, a man plucked off
[1:50:54] his shoe and gave it to his neighbor."
[1:50:57] And this was the testimony of Israel. So
[1:51:00] there came forth now the symbolism.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; What did Tob do? You know the story. He
[1:51:06] took off his shoe and he relinquished
[1:51:09] his rights. Now, brother Brandham says
[1:51:11] in this message in 1951 in commission,
[1:51:13] he says, "Redeemer
[1:51:15] and a public testimony was to be made
[1:51:18] before Israel at the gate as Boas kicked
[1:51:20] off his shoe to show that he would
[1:51:22] firmly redeem Naomi."
[1:51:25] And it was redeeming Naomi, but he got
[1:51:29] Ruth, the bride.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; So good. So good. Now, we want to
[1:51:35] parallel it back if we could because now
[1:51:37] we're looking at Joshua and he's looking
[1:51:40] way across the field and he took his
[1:51:43] shoe off on holy ground to claim it back
[1:51:45] the inheritance and God gave him the
[1:51:48] people.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Moses brought them ac up to the crossing
[1:51:53] points, but there was no redemption. And
[1:51:55] Joshua under the covenant of the shoe
[1:51:57] took back the land, but he also claimed
[1:52:00] Rahab
[1:52:02] and her family under her roof.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; So in this picture now, redemption of
[1:52:10] land, the inheritance of the land, but
[1:52:14] now also redeeming a bride with the
[1:52:16] lamb,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; the land, sorry. We see what the captain
[1:52:20] of the host was foreshadowing for what
[1:52:24] was to come.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; The captain of the host was God with us.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; The logos of God in human flesh, brother
[1:52:34] Warren.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the genealogy of the captain
[1:52:38] of the host that dwelt in human flesh
[1:52:40] came by Rahab the Jer the gentile which
[1:52:44] married Salmon and the Israelite from
[1:52:46] the tribe of Judah and her son Boaz
[1:52:50] the husband of Ruth was a Moabiti
[1:52:52] gentile but Boaz and O and Jesse and
[1:52:54] David came forth and there stands Jesus
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; all because of the covenant of the shoe.
[1:53:03] Brother Brandham says in the breach 1963
[1:53:05] he says like this. Adam could not meet
[1:53:08] the requirements of redemption after he
[1:53:11] found he was lost. He had sinned and he
[1:53:14] had and he had separated himself from
[1:53:16] God was on the size of the chasm. So he
[1:53:20] could not redeem it.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; But it took the law of the kinsman
[1:53:25] redeemer.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; He had to come. He was our champion of
[1:53:29] love. Friends, I I want to say to you,
[1:53:32] we're singing in a new song.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Because of the champion of love,
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; because of the woman's seed. And as he
[1:53:40] died on the cross of Calvary, he paid
[1:53:42] the supreme price not just for the land,
[1:53:46] the inter inheritance of a land, but he
[1:53:49] also redeemed a bride.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; To go into that land.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's right.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the commission,
[1:53:57] he says, "The debt is fully paid
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; and you're excused before God. You're
[1:54:04] taken out of the pawn shop." That's
[1:54:05] right. The only thing you have to do is
[1:54:07] accept faith
[1:54:10] in Christ and walk out of the pawn shop.
[1:54:13] That's all. He's our kinsman redeemer.
[1:54:17] He's presented the shoe.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; It's not just shoes. He's presented the
[1:54:24] covenant of redemption.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; So we see now, friends, as I close,
[1:54:33] the gentile bride no longer
[1:54:37] is painted as an immoral woman or a
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Moabitis.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; When we were wandering in a system or in
[1:54:46] the world, we of were of illreute
[1:54:49] nature.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:54:52] Just like Ruth was,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; we're just like Rahab was. We all had a
[1:54:59] filthy nature. But because he took off
[1:55:02] his shoe
[1:55:04] and he made a promise and he made a
[1:55:06] covenant, the old man was divorced
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; and had died and the sin was paid
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; and now we could be married to our
[1:55:16] kinsman redeemer.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say like this
[1:55:20] again in 51 commission. He would say
[1:55:22] Jesus when he redeemed e Israel, he got
[1:55:25] the gentile bride. He made a public
[1:55:28] testimony. He was lifted up between
[1:55:30] heavens and earth as an end sign right
[1:55:33] outside the gates of Jerusalem. And
[1:55:36] there where the supreme price was paid.
[1:55:39] He was lifted up as that shoe before
[1:55:41] men. The covenant was made of
[1:55:43] redemption. There it came forth. There
[1:55:45] was redemption. All our inheritance was
[1:55:48] lost. Our health, our strength, our
[1:55:50] salvation, all was lost back there in
[1:55:53] the fall. But what? There was redemption
[1:55:57] at Calvary.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad this morning that he
[1:56:01] lifted himself up?
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad there that he stood in
[1:56:04] the gap for you and redeemed you?
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; It's not two shoes, three shoes. It's
[1:56:10] one. Christ himself has come. And we
[1:56:13] this morning I end with this now in our
[1:56:15] hearts. We end with this in Revelations
[1:56:18] 5:9. And they sung a new song.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; A song of deliverance.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Who's singing a song today? Not a woe is
[1:56:29] me. Oh, what was way back there in
[1:56:31] Pentecost and the Baptist church and the
[1:56:33] Presbyterian. Oh, we were like this. No,
[1:56:35] it's a new song. It's a song of
[1:56:37] deliverance. It's a formal voice that
[1:56:40] says the price was paid. He lifted
[1:56:42] himself up. He was that shoe. He was
[1:56:44] that covenant said that I would pay the
[1:56:47] price for the Moabitis. And she is now
[1:56:50] clean and she is in the lineage. She is
[1:56:53] my bride. She is the perfect one.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; And they sung a new song saying unto
[1:56:59] thou art worthy to take the book and
[1:57:02] open the seals thereof. Thou for thou
[1:57:04] was slain and hast redeemed us to God by
[1:57:08] the blood out of every kindred.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:13] That's all of us.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Every tongue,
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; that's all of us,
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; peoples and nations that we could sing a
[1:57:23] new
[1:57:25] a song unto God.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Because you have adopted me, Lord.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; I have become heir of all things.
[1:57:34] Because you placed, oh God, your life
[1:57:36] inside of me, that ring upon my finger,
[1:57:38] I can stand now and sing, Lord, a new
[1:57:41] song,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; a song of deliverance. That's right.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Because the covenant of the shoe which
[1:57:50] was Christ raised before the people.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Father, we
[1:57:56] we're here this morning.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; You surround us, Lord, with a new song.
[1:58:03] Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; A song of deliverance, a a new song of
[1:58:08] praise. It's not just a hope. So, Lord,
[1:58:11] you've given us supernatural to faith to
[1:58:13] believe in of your word.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone,
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; but by every work.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Faith in that work
[1:58:28] gives us supernatural power to live.
[1:58:32] faith in that word that says the
[1:58:34] covenant maker is not just just roaming
[1:58:38] there among us but he's in us and each
[1:58:40] one of us have a portion of him
[1:58:44] this gives us overcoming power to live
[1:58:46] in a such a trying time as we wait for
[1:58:48] your coming Lord
[1:58:51] we faithfully wait Lord
[1:58:54] your word will come to pass it always
[1:58:57] has always will so we stand firm upon on
[1:59:02] the revelation of this day. For the
[1:59:04] revelation of this day has showed us who
[1:59:06] we are that that we have by fornowledge
[1:59:11] been chosen just as Rahab or Ruth were
[1:59:14] chosen. Great pains.
[1:59:17] And Lord, you all made great pains that
[1:59:19] we were called out, that we were
[1:59:21] separated, and that we could live in
[1:59:24] this new day, the eighth day, the Lord's
[1:59:27] day, still shouting for joy, and every
[1:59:30] enemy has to fall.
[1:59:34] I pray for those this morning. Maybe
[1:59:36] somebody's got a need
[1:59:38] and they want to lift their hand before
[1:59:40] you this morning.
[1:59:42] Say, Lord, I have a need.

[2:16:55] about the Gentile bride and how you care
[2:16:57] about us today. We say thank you, Lord.
