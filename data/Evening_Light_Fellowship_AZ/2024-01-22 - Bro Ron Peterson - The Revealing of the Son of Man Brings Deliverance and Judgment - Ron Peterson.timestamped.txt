[46:25] this morning in the lovely name of Jesus
[46:28] Christ amen our Lord and savior I'd like
[46:31] you to remain standing let's go directly
[46:34] to the word I have quite a bit this
[46:36] morning here we'll see how far we get
[46:38] through it thank you musicians God bless
[46:41] you uh turn with me if you would to Luke
[46:44] 17 Luke 17 then we'll go to Luke 21 1
[46:48] Peter chapter
[46:50] 1
[46:53] amen now somebody was saying the other
[46:55] day
[46:56] brother Ron what is revelation
[46:58] Revelation is God taking his thoughts
[47:03] and made known to you thank you Lord
[47:06] without it your Bible is a closed book
[47:08] without it you do not understand without
[47:10] it you become
[47:11] religious and you could be taught
[47:14] through an
[47:15] intellectual
[47:16] understanding um about God about his
[47:20] precepts and everything and that's why
[47:22] people many people become religious they
[47:24] go to churches light candles they say
[47:27] prayers they recite prayers and they
[47:30] have no relationship with him amen and
[47:34] yet they're
[47:36] religious I want to be a Christian
[47:38] without being
[47:39] religious can you say amen amen I want a
[47:43] relationship with God where I understand
[47:45] him and
[47:48] uh understand that the
[47:51] Bible has many types and shadows they're
[47:54] not just stories
[47:56] there an actual event that happened and
[47:59] when you see that event and what
[48:01] happened it sets a pattern it gives a
[48:05] shadow brother Brenham said the New
[48:08] Testament is enfolded into the Old
[48:11] Testament so what you do is you look at
[48:13] the Old Testament and you see types and
[48:18] shadows and brother BR said if you see a
[48:22] hand and it leaves a shadow whatever the
[48:25] Shadow does when this hand gets closer
[48:28] to it the two of them are going to be
[48:30] the same you're not going to have four
[48:32] fingers here and five there that's right
[48:35] yeah so the reason that brother Brenham
[48:38] said I'm a
[48:39] typologist as he says I see what God did
[48:43] back there and the Bible tells me he's
[48:46] the same yesterday today and
[48:48] forever therefore if I see and
[48:51] understand the pattern of what he did
[48:53] back there I can tell what he's going to
[48:55] do in the future future amen thank you
[48:57] Lord
[48:59] amen amen and um so Revelation to you is
[49:06] more important than you perhaps
[49:08] realize because without it your
[49:13] Bible is a dead letter that's right
[49:17] that's right it is a dead letter the
[49:18] letter kth but the spirit giveth life so
[49:22] we need the Holy Spirit to Quicken this
[49:24] word to it
[49:26] and that quickening power transforms
[49:29] you makes you different if you go to
[49:32] church and it's not changing you I've
[49:36] often said change your church because
[49:38] what you need to do is have something
[49:41] that quickens you that changes you from
[49:43] what you are and makes you a new
[49:45] creature in Christ amen all right here
[49:50] we are Luke
[49:52] 17 vers 28 and
[49:56] 30 again it's going to take a type and a
[49:59] shadow here
[50:00] likewise also as it when the as it was
[50:04] in the days of
[50:06] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[50:10] they sold they planted they build
[50:13] it but the same day that lot went out of
[50:17] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[50:21] heaven and destroyed them all even the
[50:25] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[50:29] of man is revealed there is a type in a
[50:33] shadow we'll go into that here in just a
[50:37] little bit let's just pray heavenly
[50:39] father as we have read your word we
[50:42] understand father it is a closed book a
[50:45] carnal mind is enity with God neither
[50:48] can it know God but once we are born
[50:51] again we are um privileged we're in a
[50:55] initiated people we're a people that you
[50:58] share your thoughts with and a servant
[51:01] as long as he remains a servant is no
[51:06] different than others though he be born
[51:08] Lord of all so we need you Lord to move
[51:12] us from servants to friends because
[51:14] friends then understand what to master
[51:17] doeth father I thank you may we all here
[51:21] be called the friends of God I pray now
[51:24] for your blessing upon the word inspire
[51:27] us from on high give us the Holy Spirit
[51:30] anointing I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[51:33] amen amen God bless you you may be
[51:36] seated but let's uh uh because the
[51:40] scripture reading is a little bit
[51:41] lengthy I allow you to sit down although
[51:45] I remain
[51:46] standing it's okay I always like to say
[51:49] that because it's true um Luke chapter
[51:54] 21
[51:55] and verses
[51:57] 2 5-
[52:03] 28 Luke
[52:06] 21 and verse
[52:09] 25 and thereby she there shall be signs
[52:14] in the Sun and in the
[52:16] moon and in the stars and upon the Earth
[52:20] distress of
[52:21] nations with perplexity in other words
[52:24] all of the these things are
[52:26] happening signs are
[52:28] given brother Brenham shares with us and
[52:32] he says all of these are a sign it's a
[52:35] flashing red light but though they see
[52:38] the signs they don't understand it's
[52:41] it's with perplexity why is this
[52:45] happening so they're looking at it with
[52:47] perplexity there's no understanding by
[52:50] seeing the sign alone right unless God
[52:54] gives you an understanding of what these
[52:56] signs are for thank you Lord okay so we
[52:59] go on and the Sea and the waves roaring
[53:04] men's Hearts failing them for fear and
[53:07] for looking after those things which are
[53:09] coming on the earth for the powers of
[53:12] Heaven shall be
[53:14] shaken and then shall they see the son
[53:17] of man coming in a cloud with power and
[53:21] great Glory now separate this coming of
[53:25] of him in a cloud because we know there
[53:26] is a second coming where he comes in the
[53:29] clouds and everyone sees that
[53:34] coming but this one is a
[53:37] secret only to the elect only to those
[53:41] who have eyes to see ears to hear begin
[53:45] to catch what God is doing in this
[53:50] hour and when these things begin to come
[53:53] to pass
[53:55] then look up and lift up your heads for
[53:58] your Redemption draweth
[54:00] nigh can we say Amen to that so those
[54:05] things are to just make you aware I'm
[54:11] coming I'm
[54:13] coming now those that just see signs
[54:16] only don't
[54:19] prepare they do not turn with me if you
[54:22] would back to First
[54:24] Peter
[54:25] 1 vers 19-
[54:43] 16 I said 19 9 through
[54:50] 16 if you back up there for just a
[54:54] second I did not give the Brethren but
[54:56] you that have your Bible it's there
[54:58] written in verse 5 who are kept by the
[55:02] power of God through faith amen how are
[55:07] you kept you don't keep yourself that's
[55:10] right well if I if I do all of The
[55:12] Commandments and if I study and I know
[55:14] the Greek the Hebrew and I have this
[55:17] good understanding I'll keep myself yeah
[55:20] you keep yourself about a half
[55:22] hour and then you find out that that you
[55:25] can't you can't keep your but God keeps
[55:27] you by his power through faith every one
[55:33] of you are given a Measure of Faith and
[55:36] if you don't have it's CU you didn't ask
[55:38] for
[55:40] it it is something that you ask if you
[55:43] seek you shall find if you ask it shall
[55:47] be
[55:48] given but I want to say that lying
[55:52] within every elect seed Gene of God
[55:56] there is an ability it's
[55:59] inherent it's not something that you
[56:02] actually prayed for or sought
[56:06] after but there is an inherent ability
[56:09] to hear what the spirit is saying to the
[56:12] church
[56:18] than it just was there it's
[56:22] hardwired into your Gene s
[56:27] okay and all of a sudden whether you're
[56:30] a young person or it takes a while
[56:33] brother Bram said a true seed of God can
[56:36] go a long time before he
[56:39] recognizes who he is right so some of
[56:43] you are slower than
[56:45] others it's a proof in
[56:49] school some of you are very fast
[56:51] Learners some of you catch it some of
[56:53] you the teacher has to just teach it one
[56:56] time I got it go on others repetition
[56:59] repetition and they just pass them
[57:02] because they otherwise there'd be 20
[57:04] year olds in third
[57:06] grade they just don't get it so they
[57:09] just kind of pass them on yeah good
[57:11] maybe you'll be good in
[57:16] basketball so
[57:19] anyway so uh 1 Peter 1 n and n told you
[57:26] uh who are kept by the power of God
[57:28] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[57:31] revealed in the last
[57:34] time so you're kept by the power of God
[57:38] to be revealed in the last time are we
[57:41] there amen so Revelation is what God is
[57:44] continuing to do wherein you greatly
[57:47] Rejoice through now for a season if need
[57:50] be you in heaviness through manifold
[57:53] Temptations every one of us realize that
[57:57] we're being tried by our faith now let's
[58:00] go to verse n receiving the end of your
[58:03] faith what is the end of your faith the
[58:06] faith is taking you somewhere it will
[58:09] produce something and it's a
[58:13] goal receiving the end of your faith
[58:16] even the salvation of your
[58:18] souls may I say
[58:21] this
[58:23] that the salvation of your souls the
[58:28] quickening power in this end time and
[58:31] the catching away of the Bride is
[58:34] greater than the creation
[58:37] itself because this this is the
[58:40] culmination of why he created that's
[58:43] right Hallelujah this is the
[58:46] cresendo this is you see in the
[58:49] beginning God created that's good
[58:51] wonderful created the trees and the Sun
[58:53] the moon and everything but he did it
[58:55] for a purpose that he might bring man
[58:58] back to himself we understand as type
[59:00] Shadows but you see as a mighty burst of
[59:03] Illumination comes forth as many of us
[59:06] in the Fourth of July we go out watch
[59:08] the fire bks uh fireworks and you know
[59:10] what we all kind of enjoy it and you
[59:13] have this little spinning wheels and sh
[59:16] this and that and then you got little
[59:17] ones that you go like this and boom boom
[59:21] but everyone loves the finale yeah
[59:25] the finale is all a
[59:28] sudden like this and we all go o yeah
[59:32] well that's what's happening right now
[59:34] that's why all of these events that's
[59:36] why all of the Sun the moon the stars
[59:38] the tsunamis the earthquakes all of this
[59:41] uh Putin uh China Russia all of this and
[59:46] all of this that's going on do not get
[59:49] distracted by all of these signs that
[59:52] are going off otherwise you look just at
[59:55] the signs and fail to realize there's a
[59:58] purpose why it's
[1:00:00] happening and that is look
[1:00:02] up Hallelujah because something is
[1:00:05] Drawing Near if you fail to catch that
[1:00:08] you just stand there and watch all of
[1:00:10] the
[1:00:11] fireworks and then you get it burnt up
[1:00:14] with them at the end
[1:00:15] also you don't want that that's right we
[1:00:18] want to get out of here
[1:00:20] amen amen thank you Lord
[1:00:26] receiving the end of your faith even the
[1:00:27] salvation of our
[1:00:29] souls of which salvation the prophets
[1:00:32] have inquired watch this and searched
[1:00:37] diligently so prophets inspired by God
[1:00:42] say things they don't
[1:00:44] understand Isaiah Behold a virgin shall
[1:00:47] conceive and bring
[1:00:49] forth a child whoa after he said it he
[1:00:53] thought did I say that a virgin never in
[1:00:58] the history of mankind has a virgin
[1:01:01] conceived and bring forth a child oh my
[1:01:06] and I'm sure everybody around looked at
[1:01:08] Isaiah and said
[1:01:11] really now he said that prophecy without
[1:01:15] man understanding it God brings his word
[1:01:19] to pass in season
[1:01:22] am and so it Pro that prophecy hovered
[1:01:27] around the earth until the season there
[1:01:31] had to be a season appointed time for a
[1:01:35] recipient to receive it and when it did
[1:01:39] guess what the this day this scripture
[1:01:42] is fulfilled
[1:01:44] amen now so they inquired and searched
[1:01:48] diligently verse 10 who prophesied of
[1:01:52] the grace that should come on un to you
[1:01:56] so they prophesied it but guess what
[1:01:59] it's a recipient Not only was it for
[1:02:02] them but it was for you thank you Lord
[1:02:05] searching what or what manner of time
[1:02:08] that the spirit of Christ which was in
[1:02:11] them did
[1:02:14] signify when it testified beforehand of
[1:02:17] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[1:02:21] that should
[1:02:23] follow to whom it was revealed again
[1:02:26] Revelation is
[1:02:28] revealing god making something known
[1:02:32] it's an understanding that only God can
[1:02:35] give you
[1:02:37] amen unto whom it was
[1:02:40] revealed that not unto themselves but
[1:02:44] unto us they did Minister these things
[1:02:50] which are now reported unto you by them
[1:02:52] that have preached the gospel go El unto
[1:02:54] you with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[1:02:59] heaven and which things the Angels
[1:03:03] desire to look
[1:03:05] into Now understand even the angels of
[1:03:09] heaven don't know how and when he's
[1:03:12] coming Jesus said neither did the son
[1:03:15] amen he said I have no
[1:03:18] idea he says but it will be revealed in
[1:03:21] its
[1:03:23] season verse 13 wherefore G up the lines
[1:03:26] of your mind to be
[1:03:29] sober and to the hope and hope to the
[1:03:32] end for the grace which is brought unto
[1:03:35] you at the revelation of Jesus
[1:03:39] Christ as obedient children not
[1:03:42] fashioning ourselves according to the
[1:03:44] former lust and or ignorance but as he
[1:03:47] which is hath called you as holy so be
[1:03:51] ye holy in all manner of
[1:03:53] conversation because it is written be ye
[1:03:55] holy for I am
[1:04:01] Holy
[1:04:03] amen so we realize that we must be holy
[1:04:07] as he is
[1:04:08] Holy now it's not something that we put
[1:04:12] on
[1:04:14] Holiness is something that God gives you
[1:04:17] it's revealed to
[1:04:20] you it is and the Bible says without
[1:04:23] holy
[1:04:24] no man shall see God Amen therefore in
[1:04:28] every age God gave them a measure of
[1:04:31] something for them to understand that
[1:04:34] what God was
[1:04:35] expecting now in this age which has
[1:04:39] become the darkest of all ages where
[1:04:42] seducing spirits and all kinds of
[1:04:44] doctrines of devils and times is going
[1:04:46] to get worse and worse the the word of
[1:04:49] God has been compromised it has been
[1:04:51] interpreted until wow
[1:04:55] who are we going to believe they're all
[1:04:57] we we have over a thousand different
[1:04:59] kinds of denominations all reading the
[1:05:01] same
[1:05:02] Bible which one's
[1:05:04] right they can't all be right because
[1:05:07] the Luthers don't agree with the wesan
[1:05:09] wesan don't agree with the Pentecostals
[1:05:12] Pentecostals don't even agree with
[1:05:13] themselves if we're not careful we as
[1:05:16] message believer start arguing doing the
[1:05:18] same thing and the next thing we're
[1:05:20] broke up into all kinds of things but
[1:05:22] the Bible says until we come to the
[1:05:24] unity of the faith
[1:05:27] amen and faith is revelation the only
[1:05:30] way you can become unified is say what
[1:05:33] he
[1:05:35] said well this is what I believe he said
[1:05:38] well that's where the division start and
[1:05:42] Paul said uh I uh am so upset with you
[1:05:47] he said because look one of you says I'm
[1:05:49] of Paul and another said I'm of apollis
[1:05:52] and in the very first First Church ages
[1:05:55] the first few years what is it even 50
[1:05:57] years and and the Ephesian Church who
[1:06:02] many of the disciples saw Christ they
[1:06:06] they walked with him and it wasn't but a
[1:06:09] short time and Peter's trying to make
[1:06:11] the Gentiles Jews amen trying to get
[1:06:14] them all
[1:06:18] circumcised so God's got to send a
[1:06:22] messenger okay a man born out of due
[1:06:26] season a man who
[1:06:28] religiously religiously was
[1:06:31] following religious teachings and the
[1:06:34] laws of Moses and he was persecuting the
[1:06:37] church understand that the law of God
[1:06:40] and the Commandments of God void of
[1:06:43] Revelation makes you
[1:06:45] religious amen Saul the Pharisee
[1:06:48] therefore was persecuting the church
[1:06:52] even killing them
[1:06:54] putting them into
[1:06:56] prison and uh he didn't have a
[1:07:00] revelation of God his eyes were blinded
[1:07:03] by intellectual
[1:07:06] teaching so God had to Blind his eyes to
[1:07:10] open his
[1:07:11] eyes I hope none of you are sitting here
[1:07:15] blinded by religion and you fail to see
[1:07:18] the God within the
[1:07:20] Bible because you find out that
[1:07:24] Revelation is making the mystery of God
[1:07:27] known through Jesus Christ because
[1:07:31] you'll never know
[1:07:34] God unless you know it through Jesus
[1:07:36] Christ Jesus says I didn't come to
[1:07:39] reveal
[1:07:40] myself I came to reveal the Father the
[1:07:43] Son can do nothing except the father
[1:07:45] revealing well well Jesus uh please show
[1:07:48] us the father oh my have I been so long
[1:07:52] with you have I preached so many many
[1:07:54] sermons that you haven't recognized that
[1:07:56] if you see me you've seen the father
[1:07:58] because I and the father are
[1:08:01] one Jesus was the fullness of the
[1:08:04] godhead
[1:08:07] bodily now God doing something in their
[1:08:10] midst doesn't make them all
[1:08:12] automatically see
[1:08:14] it because you could have an angel
[1:08:17] standing behind this
[1:08:19] Pulpit you could have a dynamic
[1:08:22] Supernatural move of of God and some of
[1:08:25] you would say that was just a man and
[1:08:27] another would say wow I saw it was God
[1:08:30] Amen so we understand that God can do
[1:08:34] something but not everybody see
[1:08:37] it all
[1:08:40] right so I would like
[1:08:43] to take my sermon title for this
[1:08:48] morning and I realize that the revealing
[1:08:51] of the son of man is an unending
[1:08:56] sermon it
[1:08:59] continues the mystery
[1:09:02] continues the ministry continues and the
[1:09:04] voice
[1:09:05] continues God never
[1:09:08] leaves an age or a group of people
[1:09:12] without a
[1:09:14] representative of his on the
[1:09:17] earth that's the type and the shadow if
[1:09:21] you understand the type the Shadow and
[1:09:23] you catch the pattern it's like you that
[1:09:26] have ever studied
[1:09:28] mathematics you start in mathematics by
[1:09:32] just multiplication and division and
[1:09:36] adding and subtracting once you
[1:09:38] understand the formul 2 + 2 = 4 then we
[1:09:42] can do the subtraction that 2 - 4 - 2 is
[1:09:46] 2 if you know the formula you know the
[1:09:49] answer to each one of those you begin to
[1:09:52] catch it if you miss miss the formula
[1:09:55] then you're the student that is there
[1:09:57] being taught though the teacher is
[1:09:59] teaching
[1:10:01] eloquently and putting it here and up
[1:10:04] there you are glad that somebody in the
[1:10:07] class because the teacher will say do
[1:10:09] you all understand it and none of you
[1:10:11] want to be act like the dummy so you're
[1:10:14] going no I don't but I don't want to
[1:10:15] raise my hand and then some Joe Blow in
[1:10:19] the back of the class would you say it
[1:10:21] again and you exhale very nice
[1:10:25] thank
[1:10:26] you he looks dumb I don't but I sit here
[1:10:30] I sit here still with that same I don't
[1:10:34] understand it now understand that when a
[1:10:37] word of God is teached let me go into
[1:10:40] this also for just a moment when the
[1:10:42] word of God is
[1:10:44] preached sometimes it's according to
[1:10:47] your maturity level in Christ whether or
[1:10:49] not you grasp it although you will get
[1:10:54] something out of the sermon because
[1:10:56] obviously if the if the minister talks
[1:10:59] about the love of God and you are of a
[1:11:02] new baby in Christ basically you're only
[1:11:04] going to get oh God loves me oh thank
[1:11:07] you as babies come into the world the
[1:11:09] first thing when they come out of the
[1:11:13] hospital and they come to church and
[1:11:15] they come to family you hand it to
[1:11:17] everybody and they kiss and make love to
[1:11:20] that little baby the baby that's all it
[1:11:22] knows
[1:11:25] just
[1:11:26] love the sincere milk of the word just
[1:11:29] tell me about love God loves me oh I
[1:11:32] love that then you start growing up you
[1:11:36] realize that God does love you okay
[1:11:38] that's good you you know and uh Mama
[1:11:41] finally puts you down makes you walk
[1:11:43] well no if you love me Mama come on
[1:11:45] carry me the rest of my life come
[1:11:47] on no walk kid getting too
[1:11:51] heavy you're in third great already and
[1:11:54] you're still asking me to carry you
[1:11:56] around forget it you see sometimes you
[1:12:00] mothers mother too
[1:12:01] much amen yeah you don't let the kids
[1:12:05] you know Hey listen they don't have to
[1:12:06] be petted and pampered and done
[1:12:09] everything for them they can learn to
[1:12:12] tie their own shoes you remember when
[1:12:13] you learned to tie your own shoe it was
[1:12:16] great my sister taught me my parents
[1:12:18] didn't my sister yeah take it like this
[1:12:21] put it over the rabbit goes through the
[1:12:23] hole
[1:12:25] I got it I've been tying my shoes ever
[1:12:30] since but now because of back problems
[1:12:34] and Battle of the
[1:12:37] Bulge I do slip on
[1:12:39] shoes yeah it's kind of fun you don't
[1:12:44] have to time you can just kick them off
[1:12:46] reach over and then slip down into the
[1:12:48] shoes but what I'm seeing you begin now
[1:12:53] to have to work things out yourself Mama
[1:12:56] doesn't do everything for
[1:12:59] you and we as a church do not need to
[1:13:03] keep our young ones young we expect them
[1:13:06] to grow amen we expect them to have
[1:13:09] responsibility because growing is
[1:13:12] responsibility going to school is
[1:13:14] responsibility the older you get more
[1:13:16] responsibility and as long as you can
[1:13:18] handle that responsibility and you show
[1:13:20] that you can do it Daddy Daddy I want to
[1:13:22] go play it to Park okay be back by
[1:13:25] 6:00 if he's not back until 7:00 guess
[1:13:29] what responsibility shows that he wasn't
[1:13:32] mature enough to be back by six do you
[1:13:35] understand there are some children that
[1:13:37] learn quicker than others and they'll
[1:13:39] take the responsibility
[1:13:42] others have a hard
[1:13:45] time growing
[1:13:47] up now I want to title my sermon this
[1:13:51] morning the revealing of the son of man
[1:13:54] brings deliverance and
[1:13:57] judgment it has in every
[1:14:00] age and will again in this end time so
[1:14:04] when the son of man
[1:14:06] appears whenever you see a move of God
[1:14:09] it's going to deliver one and bring
[1:14:11] judgment to another amen doesn't mean
[1:14:14] that God is unfair he gives everyone an
[1:14:16] equal opportunity in fact he gives all
[1:14:19] of you free moral agency and he says you
[1:14:22] can pick or Cho you see I believe I
[1:14:24] don't believe God doesn't Force
[1:14:27] you God allows
[1:14:30] you to make that
[1:14:34] choice amen so I want to take uh a
[1:14:39] subject this morning of recognizing your
[1:14:41] day in its message now I cannot
[1:14:45] overemphasize understanding the fact
[1:14:48] that unless you catch the message in
[1:14:51] this hour which is the way of
[1:14:56] Escape you'll stay here go through the
[1:14:58] tribulation and you're going to have a
[1:15:00] hard time if you miss the Elijah
[1:15:03] prophesied for this day you will see the
[1:15:05] next
[1:15:06] one I can promise you it will be
[1:15:10] globally on International television the
[1:15:14] two prophets coming to
[1:15:16] Israel they will be in the
[1:15:19] flesh they will be there Moses and
[1:15:22] Elijah are going to be back on the scene
[1:15:26] and when they do they're going to
[1:15:28] they're going to do the same type thing
[1:15:31] that they did when they were here on
[1:15:33] Earth they're going to they're going to
[1:15:34] create all kinds of plagues and and
[1:15:36] people will hate
[1:15:38] them the only ones that will receive
[1:15:42] those two prophets is an ordained
[1:15:45] predestinated group of people called the
[1:15:51] 144,000 so God finishes with the
[1:15:55] Gentiles there's a Rapture that goes
[1:15:59] up the two prophets come down time of
[1:16:03] trouble and tribulation starts but God's
[1:16:07] dealing with the Jews no longer the
[1:16:10] Gentiles cuz the days of the Gentiles
[1:16:13] finished fulfilled cuz that's why he
[1:16:16] sent Elijah in this hour to finish the
[1:16:18] mystery
[1:16:21] amen okay
[1:16:23] so uh I want to continue on and again I
[1:16:28] I I I I want to go slowly though I have
[1:16:31] an awful lot I want you to
[1:16:34] understand that when we speak about a
[1:16:36] message of the hour and when we speak
[1:16:38] about being in Christ you can't speak to
[1:16:44] everyone okay it's not to
[1:16:49] everyone
[1:16:50] exactly it's the elected for ordained
[1:16:56] predestinated and unless you are
[1:17:00] predestinated you hear the same word
[1:17:02] goes right over your head you got no
[1:17:04] idea there's no concept
[1:17:08] now uh
[1:17:10] again
[1:17:12] um as it's been in every age there's
[1:17:16] always a revelation or a faith that is
[1:17:20] being ministered at that at that age
[1:17:24] that time that season it's an appointed
[1:17:27] time and it's directed to the elect
[1:17:31] although it's spoken as though everyone
[1:17:33] will hear it not everyone will hear it
[1:17:36] amen for Jesus said my sheep hear my
[1:17:39] voice and a stranger they won follow is
[1:17:43] that right that's right so um there's
[1:17:46] always a revelation that's going forth
[1:17:49] and those that are called to and
[1:17:52] predestined ated to it are going to
[1:17:55] catch it those those void of
[1:18:00] revelation will produce
[1:18:03] religion Adam hid
[1:18:06] himself remember in the garden and we're
[1:18:09] going to do some types and shadows here
[1:18:11] in just a
[1:18:12] moment and he created a religious
[1:18:16] covering of fig
[1:18:18] leaves religion is a
[1:18:21] covering men are not exposing their
[1:18:25] guilt to God when they come and light a
[1:18:29] candle they're creating a religion
[1:18:33] they're saying prayers Our Father who
[1:18:35] art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[1:18:36] kingdom come thy will be
[1:18:38] done and they say their prayer and they
[1:18:41] say their heal mares and they light a
[1:18:44] candle and they become
[1:18:46] religious you see the people walking in
[1:18:48] the first time I ever walked into a
[1:18:50] church my friend Joe Zino Catholic
[1:18:53] Family Spanish and you Joe couldn't go
[1:18:56] anywhere on Sunday until he went to
[1:18:58] church so they had an early Mass hey
[1:19:01] great let's go Joe so my sister said
[1:19:04] you're going to mass you have to have a
[1:19:07] um the beads a rosary and she had it in
[1:19:11] a box with the the nice uh you know
[1:19:15] fluffy white cotton stuff in there and
[1:19:17] it's like this and and here's how you
[1:19:19] hold it wow she gave me something to
[1:19:22] hold and and and actually quite honestly
[1:19:25] when I held the rosary I felt a little
[1:19:28] religious never done but
[1:19:31] wow you know and so she said so I
[1:19:35] watched okay you see monkey see monkey
[1:19:38] do if you go to church and you see
[1:19:40] others why do they do
[1:19:43] this why do they
[1:19:46] genuflect before they enter into the Pew
[1:19:50] why is it they touch themselves with the
[1:19:52] holy water why is it that they have the
[1:19:55] little form and and the priest says
[1:19:59] something and then they repeat and you
[1:20:01] just go over and over and everything so
[1:20:03] I did everything Joe did and quite
[1:20:06] honestly when he put his hand in the
[1:20:09] water uh and he did this I did it too
[1:20:13] and I have to be honest with you I felt
[1:20:16] religious I thought o there there is
[1:20:18] something about this and so I was
[1:20:21] excited and and and I know I've told you
[1:20:24] the story but um I was excited to hear
[1:20:30] something because the only time I ever
[1:20:34] heard the name of Jesus Christ first
[1:20:37] time I was 9 years old went to Green Oak
[1:20:41] Ranch boys Camp my parents got rid of my
[1:20:43] twin brother and I for 5 days and sent
[1:20:46] us to a
[1:20:49] camp and I all I knew is it was going to
[1:20:52] be fun you got to shoot bow and arrows
[1:20:54] you got to ride on the little tiny train
[1:20:56] they had and you got to paint pictures
[1:21:00] and all this stuff so I couldn't wait we
[1:21:01] went there and I remember them saying
[1:21:05] something about Jesus Christ uh and
[1:21:08] Jesus Christ was a cuss word in our home
[1:21:11] it uh they said it all the time you know
[1:21:14] it's an amazing the Bible says that we
[1:21:16] shall not say the name of the Lord in
[1:21:18] vain right you know and yet everybody in
[1:21:21] the world everybody in many religions
[1:21:24] they get upset they hit the hammer on
[1:21:26] their nail and they use the name of the
[1:21:29] Lord in vain they don't say oh
[1:21:34] Muhammad oh
[1:21:37] Buddha they they just don't why don't
[1:21:40] they it's not really the name of the
[1:21:42] Lord
[1:21:44] so Satan does everything he could to try
[1:21:48] to discredit the name of
[1:21:51] God and so I had never heard of Jesus
[1:21:55] Christ never read a Bible never owned a
[1:21:58] Bible and they said any of you that want
[1:22:02] to come forward and give your life to
[1:22:04] God and get a new testament pocket Bible
[1:22:08] I didn't hear about born again I didn't
[1:22:10] hear about any of that all I heard is
[1:22:12] new Bible you want one come forward I
[1:22:14] came forward and so they handed them out
[1:22:17] to everybody I I loved it I was great
[1:22:20] I've never read the Bible I opened it up
[1:22:22] up and I have no idea uh Matthew Mark
[1:22:25] Luke John uh can't relate to any of
[1:22:28] those oh here's
[1:22:30] Romans Demetrius and the
[1:22:33] Gladiators Romans spartus I've seen the
[1:22:36] movies I want to read about
[1:22:39] Romans and I go in there and I start
[1:22:42] reading and I'll never forget I put on
[1:22:44] the front of the Bible this Bible was
[1:22:47] given to Ron Peterson Greeno Ranch boys
[1:22:51] Camp I put the date because he was born
[1:22:53] again I had no idea what Born Again
[1:22:56] meant and I wouldn't know until much
[1:22:58] later but it wasn't until I went with
[1:23:01] Joe Zino to a Catholic Church thousands
[1:23:04] of people we went on an early mass and I
[1:23:06] thought I I I I was quite excited I want
[1:23:10] to hear about Jesus and he spoke in in
[1:23:15] Latin any of you Catholics ever been to
[1:23:18] a mass where they speak in Latin and and
[1:23:21] you
[1:23:23] I felt
[1:23:24] cheated I I told Joe Joe I don't speak
[1:23:29] Latin why well we're not holy enough to
[1:23:32] hear God's word so therefore and I
[1:23:34] thought well that's why I'm
[1:23:36] here because I want to hear what he said
[1:23:39] so I can be better but if he speaks in
[1:23:41] Latin I uh he speaks unto me in an
[1:23:45] unknown tongue and to me he's a
[1:23:47] barbarian
[1:23:49] amen is that what the Bible said better
[1:23:52] with five words that I might know okay
[1:23:54] so here we go types and
[1:23:57] shadows when you begin to see that God
[1:24:00] does something in the beginning he
[1:24:02] creates and he keeps doing the scenario
[1:24:05] over and over again he just changes the
[1:24:07] face he changes the scenario a little
[1:24:10] bit God in morphit changes his mask and
[1:24:13] it's the identified Christ down through
[1:24:16] all the ages now it didn't say the
[1:24:18] identified Jesus Jesus was the man amen
[1:24:23] amen that the Christ Came
[1:24:26] Upon you follow me but if we understand
[1:24:29] the Christ of God
[1:24:31] because one day Philip went to Nathaniel
[1:24:36] and said hey we have found of he who is
[1:24:40] written and the scriptures and we have
[1:24:44] found a man that comes out of Nazareth
[1:24:47] and of course his brother said can any
[1:24:49] good thing come out of Nazareth right
[1:24:53] and he just said come and
[1:24:58] see and you find out that when he came
[1:25:03] he said behold an Israelite in whom
[1:25:04] there is no
[1:25:06] gu when did you know
[1:25:09] me now you you have to understand when
[1:25:12] you as a son or daughter of God come to
[1:25:17] him you don't know him but he will
[1:25:20] reveal
[1:25:21] himself he'll do something to you to all
[1:25:25] of a sudden say whoa when did you know
[1:25:29] me and all of a sudden when he tells him
[1:25:32] these things he said you're a rabbi
[1:25:35] you're a man that came from
[1:25:38] God and he he says as his brother Philip
[1:25:42] had told Nathaniel we have found the
[1:25:45] Christ of
[1:25:48] God we have found the anointing
[1:25:53] understand that this
[1:25:54] anointing follows all the way from
[1:25:57] Genesis into Exodus Leviticus
[1:26:00] Deuteronomy goes on and on and on and
[1:26:03] there's all kinds of actors and players
[1:26:05] in this play the scene changes it's new
[1:26:10] actors it's new players but the Christ
[1:26:13] of God is the one doing the acting he is
[1:26:17] the script he's the
[1:26:20] melody and he's causing
[1:26:24] amen scene five enter
[1:26:28] Isaiah and Isaiah begins to now play A
[1:26:31] Part what is it the Christ of God in him
[1:26:35] amen he doesn't know why he's doing it
[1:26:38] but he's being
[1:26:40] led by an
[1:26:44] anointing that
[1:26:45] anointing is the identified Christ of
[1:26:50] all the
[1:26:51] ages he said it was Christ in David who
[1:26:54] did what he
[1:26:56] did it was Christ in Isaiah Ezekiel he
[1:27:00] goes through all of the prophets and he
[1:27:03] begins to identify that's the Christ now
[1:27:06] let's bring it down to our day the
[1:27:08] reason you are doing and following what
[1:27:11] you are following is because it's the
[1:27:13] Christ the mystery of God in you causing
[1:27:17] you and if you don't have the Christ of
[1:27:21] God anoint in you you miss it amen
[1:27:25] what's relevant what is revelation all
[1:27:29] about it's understanding the
[1:27:34] thought well I don't get it it's just
[1:27:36] Creeds dogmas long hair long
[1:27:39] dress I'm just going along with the flow
[1:27:42] that's cuz and if you're not careful
[1:27:44] that becomes
[1:27:46] religious then we make a paper cutter
[1:27:49] cookie
[1:27:50] cutter and we just stamp the Bible says
[1:27:53] be ye not
[1:27:55] conformed that's right but be ye
[1:27:58] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:28:00] mind there are people that have for
[1:28:02] years just kind of followed along and
[1:28:06] because they were taught and because
[1:28:08] they were born into it it becomes a way
[1:28:12] of life it becomes
[1:28:14] religion and we
[1:28:16] become the Amish of our
[1:28:19] day you understand that amen
[1:28:22] people look at us oh you're a
[1:28:26] cult long hair and everything you see uh
[1:28:29] they see you walking down the mall they
[1:28:31] look at you like whoa what is this alien
[1:28:35] doing the longer that we serve God in
[1:28:39] this age the more alien we will appear
[1:28:43] to those cuz you know what my
[1:28:49] kingdom is not of this Cosmos
[1:28:52] that's right I have
[1:28:54] another and he's going to shake heaven
[1:28:57] and earth once more amen and understand
[1:29:01] that all of these things that are
[1:29:03] happening are
[1:29:05] signs why the blood
[1:29:08] moons why all of these things that are
[1:29:11] happening why the
[1:29:13] tsunamis why the governments falling
[1:29:16] apart why is fear coming upon the people
[1:29:19] why are there more neurotics now they're
[1:29:21] saying children are becoming neurotics
[1:29:24] cuz parents are pushing them into it and
[1:29:26] you know what one of the quickest way to
[1:29:28] make your child a psychotic and neurotic
[1:29:31] and and everything give them a cell
[1:29:35] phone that little blue light will
[1:29:37] Mesmerize them then they'll have friends
[1:29:40] then they'll have Instagram then they'll
[1:29:41] have
[1:29:42] Facebook even those who invented it
[1:29:47] wouldn't allow their own Teenage
[1:29:49] children to have it until much later
[1:29:51] they real realize how quickly it can
[1:29:54] consume the mind of young young people
[1:29:57] it is a device of Satan can you say Amen
[1:29:59] of
[1:30:01] that you should be 21 or old be before
[1:30:05] they even allow you to buy
[1:30:08] one it's worse than cigarettes worse
[1:30:11] than
[1:30:13] alcohol oh well let a babysitter uh-huh
[1:30:16] give it to your
[1:30:17] kids it'll babysit them all right it'll
[1:30:20] consume their mind next thing you know
[1:30:22] they want to be doing everything that
[1:30:24] they see on that I remember watching
[1:30:26] Superman as a kid faster and a speeding
[1:30:31] bullet able to leap over big buildings
[1:30:34] with a single pound you know faster than
[1:30:38] a speeding bullet yeah man hey you know
[1:30:41] what it was the cape I decided it was
[1:30:43] the cape I went in I told my mom mom she
[1:30:46] cut up an old sheet and then she bound
[1:30:49] it together she put a pin here and
[1:30:51] everything I ran around the yard
[1:30:54] Superman Superman I so I got my twin
[1:30:58] brother he always knew I was
[1:31:01] nuts I got on top of our Pontiac station
[1:31:06] wagon I said okay guys I'm going to fly
[1:31:09] now I've never flown before but I'm
[1:31:11] going to fly and get out of the way just
[1:31:14] just watch me as I go by I don't know
[1:31:16] how fast how far I'm going to go but
[1:31:20] just watch and now in my mind in my mind
[1:31:23] I'm going to fly cuz Superman
[1:31:26] does that's the cape so I got up there
[1:31:29] you guys ready they're all looking at me
[1:31:31] some smiling real
[1:31:33] big and I spread out there like that and
[1:31:36] I hit the ground you ever done the belly
[1:31:38] flop on the
[1:31:39] ground I exhale for about 2
[1:31:45] minutes I was so
[1:31:48] disappointed because I thought I would
[1:31:50] fly
[1:31:52] how much time are the things that have
[1:31:55] been brought to your little innocent
[1:31:57] mind did you think if I do what they
[1:32:02] do I'll have the same
[1:32:08] results it doesn't
[1:32:10] happen not real
[1:32:13] anyway so now watch these because in the
[1:32:17] beginning God created through the
[1:32:19] evolution of his mind he spoke and it
[1:32:22] came into manifestation so all things
[1:32:25] were created for him and by him and
[1:32:28] without him there's nothing that was
[1:32:30] created good and bad seed and
[1:32:35] nonseed I'll show you that in scripture
[1:32:38] now um brother brenon picks us up in
[1:32:40] saman church age follow along with me
[1:32:43] now now then we're coming to a
[1:32:47] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[1:32:50] manifest in the Sun and Jesus dwelt in
[1:32:53] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:32:56] and that Eternal one was the father
[1:32:59] manifested in
[1:33:01] flesh and thereby gained the title of
[1:33:04] son even so we Eternal in his thoughts
[1:33:10] in our turn became a many membered
[1:33:14] spoken word seed manifest in flesh and
[1:33:19] those Eternal thoughts now manifest Ed
[1:33:22] in flesh are the sons of God even as we
[1:33:26] are so
[1:33:28] called now this is in capital in your
[1:33:31] seven Church AG book I did not
[1:33:33] capitalize this we did not become seed
[1:33:37] by the
[1:33:40] rebirth that's a Pentecostal
[1:33:45] teaching we did not become seed by the
[1:33:49] rebirth we were seed
[1:33:52] amen hallelujah and
[1:33:55] therefore we're reborn for only the
[1:33:59] elect somebody say only the
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:02] elect wait a
[1:34:04] second this is
[1:34:07] amazing for only the
[1:34:09] elect can be
[1:34:12] reborn because we were seed amen is the
[1:34:17] reason we could be
[1:34:20] quickened in
[1:34:22] nonseed right there's nothing to
[1:34:26] Quicken now we can take a rock and a
[1:34:29] plant and put him both outside and the
[1:34:32] Sun and the rain falls on both the Rock
[1:34:35] and the plant but there is one that's
[1:34:37] going to be quickened by the sun and the
[1:34:40] rain and it's going to come to life
[1:34:43] that's because of the law of the life
[1:34:45] that's in the seed in The Rock he
[1:34:47] understands the same
[1:34:49] conditions but guess what
[1:34:52] he just feels the anointing oh the sun
[1:34:54] it feels so good how many people go to
[1:34:56] church oh I just felt so good maybe me
[1:34:58] feel holy oh the warm sunlight oo I love
[1:35:01] it tell me about God's
[1:35:03] love or the rain falls on it and oh that
[1:35:06] was such an anointing okay they feel
[1:35:09] that but does nothing to the Rock why no
[1:35:13] seed right they feel it on the outside
[1:35:17] but it doesn't change them on the inside
[1:35:19] only those ordained to life will catch
[1:35:23] it because only the elect can be reborn
[1:35:27] so let's look at the
[1:35:30] pattern God created an Eden in the
[1:35:34] beginning for man to live in that's
[1:35:36] God's Garden in fact Eden is called
[1:35:39] God's garden and where do you plant your
[1:35:42] crop in a garden so God took the first
[1:35:47] human beings that he planted and he put
[1:35:49] them in Eden man woman but let's just
[1:35:53] take the woman for a moment because the
[1:35:55] woman in the Bible is a
[1:35:57] church the woman was made for the man
[1:36:01] not the man for the woman the woman was
[1:36:04] given to the man that he might procreate
[1:36:08] and he might replenish the Earth let me
[1:36:11] throw you a curveball here for just a
[1:36:13] second do you know we are not the first
[1:36:17] to inhabit Tera Firma called Earth
[1:36:22] do you know that brother Brenham said
[1:36:25] there were
[1:36:27] civilizations and
[1:36:30] peoples before
[1:36:34] us and he says so in the beginning God
[1:36:37] created the Heaven and the
[1:36:40] Earth and he and when God creates
[1:36:43] everything he doesn't make it chaos cuz
[1:36:46] God's not chaos there's no confusion in
[1:36:48] God God made the Earth but then the
[1:36:51] Earth Earth became without form and
[1:36:53] void God destroyed the early
[1:36:55] civilization and said wipe it
[1:36:58] off that's why when Rebecca said but
[1:37:02] we've been taught in
[1:37:04] school that he says that that that
[1:37:06] there's all kinds of uh civilizations
[1:37:09] and Bones of people and prehistoric and
[1:37:12] all this kind of stuff daddy it just
[1:37:14] shows the Bible's wrong he said no
[1:37:16] because between Genesis 1 and Genesis 2
[1:37:20] you put a period he said right there
[1:37:22] there could have been millions of years
[1:37:27] amen so he says that's why he told Adam
[1:37:31] go and replenish the Earth replenish
[1:37:34] means put back man back on the Earth
[1:37:36] again that's right that's a whole
[1:37:38] another sermon and I just threw you a
[1:37:40] curveball well you just keep swinging
[1:37:42] and when you get in the batter's
[1:37:45] box I'll throw a
[1:37:48] slider but that's why he these are
[1:37:52] Mysteries that's why the Bible has our
[1:37:55] answers so now God he creates he creates
[1:37:59] a woman so now watch in the Old
[1:38:02] Testament the Old Testament begins with
[1:38:05] a woman a
[1:38:07] virgin but before the man and woman
[1:38:11] could come together to procreate and
[1:38:14] they're not going to procreate by sex
[1:38:17] because God never used sex to make
[1:38:20] anything
[1:38:21] that's an animal act
[1:38:25] amen because he was the Beast of the
[1:38:28] field he was a serpent that's what he
[1:38:31] was he walked upright like man there's
[1:38:33] your Missing
[1:38:36] Link God knows the difference between a
[1:38:39] beast and a reptile it wasn't until
[1:38:42] after okay serpent because thou has done
[1:38:44] this upon thy belly Thou shalt crawl so
[1:38:48] God changed him from a beast that could
[1:38:51] and did
[1:38:52] mingle with man and woman and so you
[1:38:56] have a woman of Virgin in an
[1:38:59] Eden and the one that visits her gives
[1:39:03] to her and defiles her womb with a wrong
[1:39:08] seed amen she goes to Adam guess what I
[1:39:12] got she shows next thing you know he
[1:39:15] being a type of Christ redeems her and
[1:39:17] gives her seed also so now in the woman
[1:39:20] is two seeds
[1:39:25] elect seed and
[1:39:30] nonseed now to show you the pattern and
[1:39:32] the
[1:39:34] type that the two of them want to go to
[1:39:39] church and so God they want to worship
[1:39:42] god brother Ram said you look at Nations
[1:39:47] and countries and people it don't matter
[1:39:49] what color skin they got no matter what
[1:39:52] geographic location the Aborigines in
[1:39:55] Australia the eskimos in Alaska anywhere
[1:40:00] the Native American here in America they
[1:40:03] have to the great spirit man was made to
[1:40:07] worship
[1:40:09] something it's
[1:40:13] inherent
[1:40:15] so here's the first two created and they
[1:40:19] want to worship God they want to go to
[1:40:20] church so they start building
[1:40:23] altars and
[1:40:26] Cain he actually comes and he builds a
[1:40:28] big beautiful altar what was it he put
[1:40:31] on his
[1:40:32] altar fruit of the field do you realize
[1:40:37] that if you go back in the Book of
[1:40:39] Genesis and you find out because thou
[1:40:42] Hast done this Adam and
[1:40:44] Eve I am not going to curse Adam I'm
[1:40:47] going to curse the ground and ground you
[1:40:51] will not bring the full fruition of the
[1:40:54] fruit no more I'm going to curse the
[1:40:56] ground among thistles and
[1:40:59] Thorns amen so the ground was already
[1:41:04] cursed so what does he
[1:41:06] do he's void of
[1:41:09] Revelation he takes something cursed
[1:41:12] gives it back to
[1:41:14] God that's what Voodoo people
[1:41:17] do that's what these ones that they want
[1:41:20] to worship ship God they M an altar they
[1:41:23] take the alcohol the
[1:41:26] whiskey we pour it out to the god of
[1:41:29] voodoo we do and they cut they have the
[1:41:32] blood they do this
[1:41:35] right void of Revelation but they have
[1:41:38] to do something to worship do you think
[1:41:40] God's in that no does he accept it no
[1:41:44] but they do it are they sincere do they
[1:41:47] get all worked up do they work
[1:41:49] themselves up into an emotion and they
[1:41:50] do do a little whirly durly and next
[1:41:52] thing you know and some kind of chant if
[1:41:55] you ain't ever been around one I tell
[1:41:57] you it's it's something different
[1:41:59] now I that's another story but I've told
[1:42:03] you
[1:42:06] before I've seen witches and W Witch
[1:42:08] Doctors I've seen them speak in
[1:42:11] tongues I've seen
[1:42:13] them we had a we were on the reservation
[1:42:17] sorry I opened
[1:42:19] the we were out framing houses on the
[1:42:23] reservation a flash flood I've never
[1:42:25] seen a flash flood in the state of
[1:42:27] Arizona I saw one that day it was
[1:42:30] raining so hard so many inches of rain
[1:42:32] coming on the namaho reservation we're
[1:42:35] out there we're framing I said hey
[1:42:37] Marvin we got to go man let's we load up
[1:42:40] we put all our stuff in the back we had
[1:42:41] a big old uh dump truck we threw it all

[1:42:47] back of the truck and we head out well
[1:42:49] guess what we're going and wind she
[1:42:51] wipers like this and it's getting muddy
[1:42:53] and we're slipping and sliding I said
[1:42:56] Marvin what is
[1:42:57] that what is that the trees are
[1:43:01] exploding it's a wall of water coming
[1:43:04] across flat
[1:43:06] desert a 6- foot wall of water coming
[1:43:10] across the desert and when it hits the
[1:43:12] cacti and it hits the sorro and it hits
[1:43:15] the juniper trees and all of this guess
[1:43:18] what if you've ever seen water come
[1:43:19] rushing it hits and splashes and I don't
[1:43:23] realize I've never seen it before and so
[1:43:27] all of a sudden we get caught in a 6ot
[1:43:30] wall of
[1:43:34] water anyway we left the truck we walked

[1:45:14] truck started we get off the reservation
[1:45:16] come back the next day and one of my

[1:46:13] unconscious and they couldn't take the
[1:46:15] bullet out of him uh because of that
[1:46:19] part of the brain without making him uh
[1:46:22] a paraplegic or something so they left
[1:46:24] the bullet in there
[1:46:26] but Mr King you don't ask him anything

[1:52:19] the view mirror this is the truck is
[1:52:21] just getting full of mud we're slipping
[1:52:23] and sliding in four-wheel drive and I
[1:52:26] look and there's a small little patch on
[1:52:29] my side on my mirror that doesn't have
[1:52:31] mud and I can see headlights of somebody
[1:52:35] behind flashing
[1:52:37] their and it's catching on us here is Mr
[1:52:41] King two wheeel drive pickup long wheel
[1:52:44] base and he's catching us and we're in a
[1:52:47] four-wheel drive anyway way we stop Mr
[1:52:51] King hey I have

[1:52:56] compressor five out of
[1:53:01] five don't tell me the spirits don't
[1:53:04] know brother Bram said I've seen witches
[1:53:07] and WG
[1:53:09] witchard Wizards drink out of a human
[1:53:12] skull prophesy and it be right and he
[1:53:16] says and interpret what yeah he goes on
[1:53:18] hey so I've seen in the spirit
[1:53:22] realm okay of what people can do and you
[1:53:26] know what she knew she went into that
[1:53:29] realm she was the most famous handshaker
[1:53:32] on the Navajo reservation I did a little
[1:53:35] deed to her here just excuse
[1:53:38] me um I'll come back I'm I'm showing
[1:53:42] types and shadows so Old Testament
[1:53:45] starts with a
[1:53:46] woman a virgin in Eden
[1:53:50] has a visitor serpent gets wrong seed
[1:53:53] brings forth two children children they
[1:53:56] then bring their offerings God says one
[1:53:59] I refuse it's wrong and what does Cain
[1:54:03] do he gets
[1:54:06] mad what does the modernday man do when
[1:54:10] he gives God a sacrifice when he lights
[1:54:13] candles when he says the rosary when he
[1:54:16] does all this kind of stuff and if God
[1:54:18] tells him I don't receive receive it he
[1:54:21] gets mad well then I'll quit your church
[1:54:25] because he's void of Revelation and to
[1:54:28] the other one Abel God says I receive it
[1:54:32] why I want to ask you what was it that
[1:54:35] caused able to present a more acceptable
[1:54:39] sacrifice than that of
[1:54:42] Cain
[1:54:43] Revelation what was it he
[1:54:46] offered a bloody
[1:54:48] lamb
[1:54:50] you see all of a
[1:54:51] sudden as he's he's he's
[1:54:54] worshiping God what what what what a
[1:55:00] lamb I saw a bloody
[1:55:04] lamb his offering wasn't
[1:55:07] pretty he ties up a lamb if any of you
[1:55:10] have ever seen an animal
[1:55:13] killed and you and there on that
[1:55:15] reservation we saw Mrs King kill a lamb
[1:55:18] in front of us and we had a lamb
[1:55:20] feast and she took the the lamb tied it
[1:55:24] up and she comes over and takes a a
[1:55:26] knife and cuts it throat and the Lamb's
[1:55:30] going and the blood squirting it's not a
[1:55:34] pretty
[1:55:37] sight and Abel lays his hand on a bloody
[1:55:41] lamb and the lamb becomes his
[1:55:45] sacrifice and God said I receive it
[1:55:50] here is one void and here is one that
[1:55:53] catches something so now we understand
[1:55:56] by types and shadows because the New
[1:55:59] Testament begins with a
[1:56:01] woman in Eden but it's not in God's Eden
[1:56:05] it's in Satan's Eden but she has a
[1:56:08] visitor also but this visitor is an
[1:56:11] angel sent from God and she says but how
[1:56:15] will these things be it said it won't be
[1:56:17] by sex birth it'll be by a holy ghost
[1:56:22] conception and that which is born in you
[1:56:25] will be of the Holy
[1:56:29] Ghost not many days hence and the Holy
[1:56:33] Spirit shall overshadow you and you
[1:56:35] shall conceive Immaculate
[1:56:38] Conception bringing forth now not to
[1:56:43] different seeds only an elect
[1:56:48] seed
[1:56:50] amen God
[1:56:53] taking the air of Genesis 1 and bringing
[1:56:58] it down and remedying it in a new
[1:57:02] testament the two
[1:57:04] Vines he said watch the two Vines from
[1:57:08] Cain and Abel Jacob and Esau all the way
[1:57:11] down he said you can watch The Trail Of
[1:57:14] The Serpent and the trail of the word of
[1:57:18] God
[1:57:20] amen
[1:57:23] amen it was beyond any five physical
[1:57:27] senses it wasn't by
[1:57:30] feeling no she didn't feel
[1:57:34] it she believed
[1:57:37] it now the mystery continues so
[1:57:39] Revelations God sharing you with his
[1:57:41] thoughts so we see in the Old Testament
[1:57:44] what God did that's a type and a shadow
[1:57:46] are we are we together on that so so
[1:57:49] then we can tell what God did he's doing
[1:57:53] it again what he did in Genesis he's
[1:57:56] doing now in the New
[1:58:00] Testament now any of you ever gone
[1:58:03] hunting with a a blood hound any of you
[1:58:06] ever haunted something with a blood
[1:58:09] hound and get out there well we've done
[1:58:11] it before and when you do a blood hound
[1:58:14] which is a good blood hound he goes by
[1:58:16] sin he does not go by Society doesn't go
[1:58:20] by hearing in fact when you're out there
[1:58:22] and you cut a track and all of a sudden
[1:58:25] and the dogs and and when the owner gets
[1:58:27] out the
[1:58:30] dog they're excited all they want to do
[1:58:32] let me go let me run well you've always
[1:58:35] got an experienced dog and other
[1:58:38] inexperienced ones that are just along
[1:58:40] for the
[1:58:41] run so all of a sudden you let out all
[1:58:44] the dogs and that experienced one takes
[1:58:48] the lead and then all of a sudden the
[1:58:50] younger dogs usually start out running
[1:58:54] and they're not following anything but
[1:58:56] just I'm in
[1:58:58] church this is fun let's run run and so
[1:59:02] they're all running and everything but
[1:59:03] here is that experience
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:07] St I got the trail I lost it for a
[1:59:11] minute I I'm back on it and her little
[1:59:14] tail and her whack going going now that
[1:59:17] blood hound is trained to not go by
[1:59:19] the eyesight or no you know it doesn't
[1:59:22] see the animal and all of a
[1:59:25] sudden that animal runs up a
[1:59:27] tree and the scent no longer on the
[1:59:30] ground I've lost of scent where is it I
[1:59:32] better go back and they start circling
[1:59:34] around all of a
[1:59:39] sudden they start looking up a tree then
[1:59:42] all the others they get the same
[1:59:43] Revelation and they're all they're all
[1:59:45] barking
[1:59:48] treed well guess what that that animal
[1:59:51] did if it's smart animal goes up a tree
[1:59:54] gets on a branch and goes to another
[1:59:55] tree gets on another branch and while
[1:59:58] they're all
[1:59:59] going and a hunter comes up here you
[2:00:02] lion dog you're barking up the
[2:00:05] wrong tree there ain't no up here
[2:00:06] he's SM smarter than you but old
[2:00:10] Betsy huh yeah she she I'm not he's up
[2:00:15] here yeah but I'm going keep an eye on
[2:00:17] him I'm circling ah I see movement like
[2:00:20] this and while these
[2:00:23] other
[2:00:25] inexperienced they're all barking like
[2:00:27] this he's over and and going from tree
[2:00:30] to tree a man's like a tree and he goes
[2:00:32] from this tree from this man from this
[2:00:35] man he goes over and drops down and
[2:00:37] guess what Oh Betsy gets back on it
[2:00:39] again then the others get excited and
[2:00:42] they take off again then then it it
[2:00:44] guess what it goes through the water
[2:00:45] goes through all kinds of water baptism
[2:00:48] and Bs
[2:00:49] Betsy there's no scent on the water but
[2:00:52] if I just keep going around here it's
[2:00:54] not father son Holy
[2:00:56] Ghost Lord Jesus Christ here it
[2:01:00] is then that thing goes up on the rocks
[2:01:02] hard to follow the scent on the Rocks
[2:01:05] okay you got to have ground wet moisture
[2:01:08] so I was they're going huh from rock to
[2:01:10] rock from church to
[2:01:12] church right I know and old Betsy she's
[2:01:15] just going
[2:01:16] around and she catches why watch this it
[2:01:20] it may be seven days seven Church ages
[2:01:26] it might be that old Betsy misses the
[2:01:29] trail for a little bit but once she
[2:01:32] picks up the scent she starts balling
[2:01:37] again and I want you to understand we
[2:01:40] have followed the
[2:01:43] trail of the blood yes amen from One
[2:01:47] messenger to another
[2:01:49] amen here it was Paul Paul the
[2:01:53] first hey follow Paul as I follow yeah
[2:01:57] and all of a sudden Paul goes off the
[2:01:58] scene Oh Betsy where is where is he I
[2:02:02] know I just make a couple circles it's
[2:02:04] just a few years there's something and
[2:02:06] here
[2:02:07] irenius I got it again here it is all of
[2:02:10] a sudden it's just a few years irenius
[2:02:12] goes off the scene B I know I know he's
[2:02:16] around here somewhere here comes
[2:02:19] Martin Here Comes
[2:02:21] Columbo here comes the 7th Church age
[2:02:23] messenger oh I found
[2:02:25] him good am do you understand that's
[2:02:30] right there are people in every age that
[2:02:35] are
[2:02:36] ordained to follow the blood path thank
[2:02:39] you
[2:02:40] Lord do you understand they will catch
[2:02:44] it by just making a natural analogy
[2:02:47] sorry
[2:02:51] all
[2:02:54] right caral mind won't understand
[2:02:59] it intellectual mind won't catch
[2:03:04] it watch
[2:03:07] this but the seed of God is
[2:03:09] predestinated to catch it
[2:03:12] amen you don't go to Seminary to get
[2:03:16] it it's not somebody teaching you in do
[2:03:19] it it's not knowing the Greek and the
[2:03:21] Hebrew though that's good and though you
[2:03:24] compare the Bible verse by verse verse
[2:03:28] even in the early church age they
[2:03:30] divided the church over an
[2:03:33] accent a
[2:03:35] dipthong of how you enunciate a word and
[2:03:38] it split the church how many people
[2:03:42] split over little insignificant
[2:03:46] differences White Horse White
[2:03:50] Cloud ream said what difference does it
[2:03:53] make as long as we agree he's coming
[2:03:55] amen we argue and fuss over the least
[2:03:57] little thing and want well if you don't
[2:03:59] see it my way then you're
[2:04:02] out so now watch this God used Luther
[2:04:05] I'm going to give you types and shadows
[2:04:08] God used Luther he gave him a message
[2:04:11] and Luther's word became the message for
[2:04:14] that hour can we agree on that we can
[2:04:16] look and see that it had such an effect
[2:04:20] and he only had one verse in the Bible
[2:04:23] anointed to him one
[2:04:27] verse can you
[2:04:29] imagine he looks and says then the just
[2:04:33] shall live by
[2:04:38] faith and he starts a
[2:04:41] Reformation he starts a protest and they
[2:04:44] become
[2:04:47] Protestants wow
[2:04:49] but then Luther goes off the scene God
[2:04:51] moves on Along Comes Wesley picks up the
[2:04:55] tril again God uses them and now Wesley
[2:04:59] starts a move of God that we've got to
[2:05:03] put our faith into action so we have a
[2:05:06] method a method on how we serve God so
[2:05:10] we became the
[2:05:12] Methodist and it dies and God moves
[2:05:17] on so God used
[2:05:19] Pentecost follow now the types the
[2:05:23] Shadows messenger message Anointed The
[2:05:27] Christ of God it dies God moves on then
[2:05:32] comes Pentecost guess what they
[2:05:34] denominate God moves on so God brings
[2:05:37] William
[2:05:40] brandham let me say something and blow
[2:05:42] your mind here for just a
[2:05:45] moment and when he dies God moves up
[2:05:49] on
[2:05:52] Amen now the tapes are stored up food
[2:05:56] that's right am but if you catch this
[2:06:00] the ministry
[2:06:02] changes there's a new
[2:06:04] Administration when Jesus Christ died
[2:06:07] the ministry didn't change God just
[2:06:10] changes his math amen he goes to another
[2:06:13] body which is his same body because the
[2:06:16] Holy Spirit only goes into his own
[2:06:19] body demons go into any kind of body
[2:06:23] pigs horses dogs
[2:06:28] bats but the Holy Spirit can only enter
[2:06:31] into his body so now brother Brenham
[2:06:36] comes with a
[2:06:38] message that's what makes us
[2:06:41] different because now we have something
[2:06:44] come out of her my people come out of
[2:06:45] what Jezebel religion amen come out of
[2:06:49] three Gods he's not three Gods he's one
[2:06:51] God his name is not father son Holy
[2:06:54] Ghost it's Lord Jesus Christ and Jehovah
[2:06:57] of the old is Jesus of the new oh
[2:07:01] wow and there before our wondering
[2:07:05] eyes okay he he takes us away from Pagan
[2:07:10] idolatry of Christmas and of Easter and
[2:07:13] the
[2:07:15] commercialism and he brings us into
[2:07:17] truth and he said be careful you don't
[2:07:19] go right back into Catholicism again
[2:07:22] that's the mother Harlot and when she
[2:07:24] has children they're the same as the
[2:07:29] mother she's the mother and her
[2:07:31] daughters are
[2:07:36] harlots I want to ask you what part of
[2:07:38] Catholic Doctrine would you
[2:07:43] accept

[2:25:02] my
[2:25:03] quote religious teachings of God's
[2:25:08] word which are just
[2:25:10] intellectual
[2:25:14] understanding void of Revelation
[2:25:18] produces religious
[2:25:22] people you got
[2:25:27] that this
[2:25:30] message void of
[2:25:34] Revelation produces religious people it
[2:25:38] was the religious people that crucified
[2:25:41] Christ it's religious people that'll
[2:25:44] hate you within the message cuz you
[2:25:46] disagree with
[2:25:47] [Music]
[2:25:50] him listen if the
[2:25:53] Capstone is supposed to come down the
[2:25:56] last step between the other steps of the
[2:25:58] pyramid coming up what's the last
[2:26:01] portion we're supposed to have
[2:26:05] brotherly kindness and love where do you
[2:26:08] where do you see that and wait preachers
[2:26:11] preaching oh God is love God is kindness
[2:26:15] disagree with him ah you're out of
[2:26:18] here you don't see it my way hit the
[2:26:23] highway huh
[2:26:25] amen meaner than a junkyard
[2:26:29] dog where what about the
[2:26:32] law how about can we disagree with one
[2:26:34] another is it okay huh siblings
[2:26:38] especially have a hard time with that
[2:26:40] you got
[2:26:41] kids just put them together in the back
[2:26:44] of the car you'll find exit get mom he's
[2:26:47] too close to me Mom tell him scoot over
[2:26:51] Mom he took my toy
[2:26:55] mom then the mother takes off her
[2:26:59] shoe the kids
[2:27:05] are what happened in our
[2:27:10] family so when you come to
[2:27:14] church you want to hear something that's
[2:27:16] going to bring you
[2:27:17] into a
[2:27:20] Perfection because that's the direction
[2:27:22] I'm I'm going to take
[2:27:24] this and I'll give you a preview right
[2:27:27] now of also what I'm going to preach
[2:27:29] with the revealing of the son of man
[2:27:31] comes another
[2:27:33] revealing cuz you can't have the
[2:27:35] revealing of the truth without the
[2:27:37] revealing of eror so when the revealing
[2:27:39] of the son of man comes guess what you
[2:27:42] got the son of predition he was born son
[2:27:45] of predition Jacob have I loved and Esau

[2:28:00] Esau how can God hate Esau he's
[2:28:06] nonseed
[2:28:09] amen now I know that blows a lot of
[2:28:12] people because people think that God
[2:28:14] can't hate something he does
[2:28:17] and God only
[2:28:19] chastises his own children he said a
[2:28:23] bastard born son is without
[2:28:26] correction he don't waste his
[2:28:30] time are we together on that okay I'm
[2:28:34] sorry I man

[2:29:16] a wise master builder let every man take
[2:29:19] heed how he builds on he said wood

[2:29:38] church wolves and sheep's
[2:29:41] clothing he said you better know the
[2:29:43] difference and the only way you're going
[2:29:44] to know the difference is you better be
[2:29:46] be a student of the word of God
[2:29:48] otherwise it'll be so
[2:29:50] close that it'll deceive if it were
[2:29:53] possible but it's not possible why God
[2:29:56] said I'll shorten the days amen thank

[2:31:27] Jezebel
[2:31:29] Harlot what is it brother Rena I'm going
[2:31:33] to end with this quote how does a church
[2:31:36] commit spiritual adultery on Christ the
[2:31:39] [Music]
[2:31:41] word how does it commit spiritual
[2:31:45] adultery on Christ's word word when you
[2:31:47] knowing better by the Intercourse of the
[2:31:49] Mind add to or take away put your own
[2:31:52] interpretation to it he said you are
[2:31:54] absolutely committing adultery on Christ
[2:31:57] the
[2:31:58] word he said don't add to it don't take
[2:32:01] from it just say what it says amen amen

[2:32:18] cuz you've been playing around with
[2:32:19] unclean spirits looking at the wrong
[2:32:22] thing putting your mind because the
