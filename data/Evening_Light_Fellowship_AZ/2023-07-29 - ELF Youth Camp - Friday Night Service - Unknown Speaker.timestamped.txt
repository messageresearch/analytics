[6:20] um another thing trash uh I'm not sure
[6:24] if some of you have as you walk around
[6:27] you see some empty water bottles you see
[6:30] some trash on the ground different
[6:32] things uh just to remind you guys you
[6:34] know we want to keep a testimony before
[6:37] the camp here and we want to be known as
[6:40] uh uh a people that in a camp that pick
[6:44] up after themselves
[6:46] uh now some of you have done an
[6:49] excellent job even last night as we were
[6:52] cleaning up in the back here there was
[6:54] some of you that were going under the
[6:56] tables and picking up three or four
[6:58] water bottles and and different things
[7:00] let's let's not leave it up to just the
[7:03] same three or four people but take a
[7:06] little bit of responsibility take a
[7:09] little bit of pride in yourself and say
[7:11] well uh instead of just walking past an
[7:15] empty water bottle that you know has
[7:16] been there for a little while hey
[7:18] instead of leaving it for somebody else
[7:20] take two seconds pick it up empty it out
[7:23] if there's water in it throw it in the
[7:24] trash easy right
[7:27] will you guys do that
[7:29] you know why I want you to do it because
[7:31] it saves me doing it
[7:33] many hands make light work okay so let's
[7:36] do our due diligence let's pick up trash
[7:38] after ourselves
[7:40] um also we have noticed there's uh a lot
[7:44] of things that we see laying around
[7:46] purses handbags cell phones there was uh
[7:49] uh somebody had lost her cell phone I
[7:51] had it all day
[7:53] and I was like how does somebody not
[7:54] know that they lost their cell phone so
[7:57] it just goes to show that they were
[7:58] doing what they were asked and they were
[8:00] not looking on their phone and all these
[8:02] different things so if you have lost
[8:05] something the lost and found is in this
[8:07] room right here we've set up a table and
[8:10] um
[8:11] if we see something laying around or
[8:13] whether it's a little purse a handbag a
[8:16] cell phone uh cash whatever it may be
[8:19] we're gonna pick it up and we're gonna
[8:20] put it in this room right here
