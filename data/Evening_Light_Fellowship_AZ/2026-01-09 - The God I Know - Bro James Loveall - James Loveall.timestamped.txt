[32:02] Truly, Father, we stand in awe of you.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are humbled
[32:15] that you seem fit to choose.
[32:18] Choose us, Lord.
[32:20] that you called us out of our darkness.
[32:23] And
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, how thankful we are to be your
[32:29] people,
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, that we would know you in the
[32:34] power of your resurrection. That
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Father, as we stand here in awe of you
[32:41] and your goodness and your mercy in our
[32:43] lives, how thankful and blessed we are.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, we can't thank you enough. We
[32:49] can't praise you enough, Lord. We can't
[32:52] worship you enough for all the things
[32:54] that you've seen fit to do in our lives,
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, in the good times and in the bad
[32:59] times. We praise you.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; And Father, once again, Lord, we have
[33:05] gathered,
[33:07] Lord, in this tabernacle,
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, asking that you would speak to
[33:11] your people, that you would come by our
[33:13] way, that you would walk the aisles.
[33:15] That Lord, we know that your people have
[33:17] needs. They have desires in their lives.
[33:19] And Lord, there's nothing I can do as a
[33:21] man. But Father, you sent your word and
[33:24] it heals the people.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; It brings deliverance to your people.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Father, would you relax my spirit? Would
[33:34] you quieten it? Oh God,
[33:37] &gt;&gt; would you come and take control?
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Would you have preeminence? And Lord,
[33:43] use my lips as a mouthpiece. And Father,
[33:46] would you soften the hearts of your
[33:48] children, Lord, that as the word goes
[33:50] forth and they begin to receive the
[33:52] word, may they take it into their heart,
[33:53] oh God,
[33:56] &gt;&gt; we just ask that you would have your way
[33:57] in this service, and we'll be sure to
[34:00] give you the praise, the honor, and the
[34:01] glory
[34:03] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[34:08] You love the Lord this evening.
[34:11] If you have your Bibles,
[34:14] let's turn to St. John 14.
[34:18] Before I get started, I had to use a
[34:20] piece of paper to remind me because the
[34:24] last couple of times I kind of just took
[34:26] off and I forgot to uh
[34:29] thank you all um the last time we had
[34:31] spoke to thank you for um the gifts and
[34:36] the the things that you gave us there at
[34:37] the end of the year.
[34:39] as we had our little one, mom and baby
[34:41] are doing well and uh she's definitely
[34:44] been the best baby out of all all three
[34:47] of them. And so I'm thankful for that.
[34:50] And yet you forget how
[34:53] uh
[34:55] sleepless nights and those things that
[34:57] you think you put behind you, but that's
[35:00] okay. She's sleeping at least three
[35:02] hours, so I'm thankful for that.
[35:05] And we want to thank those that have
[35:07] helped with the boys um taking them for
[35:10] the day and stuff. Those little things
[35:11] have they it means a lot and helps us
[35:14] and you know when you go from one to two
[35:16] kids or you know two to three you become
[35:18] outnumbered
[35:20] and so then you got to go to zone
[35:21] defense and it's no longer man-to-man.
[35:24] But hey, we're figuring it out. And
[35:27] we do want to thank you all for the food
[35:29] that you guys have given us. And it's
[35:31] hard to start the new year on a diet
[35:33] when you guys are showing up with
[35:36] the good stuff and all the desserts. And
[35:39] we do want to thank you for that. So
[35:41] let's turn to the scriptures now.
[35:46] St. John 14
[35:48] and verse 5.
[35:51] And Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know
[35:53] not whether thou goest, and how can we
[35:56] know the way?
[35:59] And Jesus saith unto him, I am the way,
[36:02] the truth, and the life. No man cometh
[36:04] unto the Father, but by me.
[36:07] If he had known me, he had should have
[36:09] known my father also, and from hence you
[36:12] know him, and have seen him. And Philip
[36:15] saith unto him, Lord, show us the
[36:17] Father, and it sufficeth us.
[36:20] And Jesus saith unto him, Have I been
[36:22] with Have I been so long with you, and
[36:24] yet thou sayest that thou not know me,
[36:28] Philillip?
[36:29] And he that hath seen me hath seen the
[36:32] Father. And how sayest thou then showest
[36:34] the Father?
[36:36] Believest thou that I am in my Father,
[36:38] and the Father in me, and the words that
[36:40] I speak unto you, I speak not of myself,
[36:43] but the Father that dwelleth in me. He
[36:45] doeth the works.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Believe me that I am in my Father, and
[36:49] the Father in me, or else believe me for
[36:52] the work, the very work's sake. Verily,
[36:55] verily, I say unto you, he that
[36:58] believeth on me, the works that I do,
[37:00] shall ye do also. And a greater works
[37:03] than these shall ye do, because I go
[37:05] unto my father. And whatsoever ye shall
[37:08] ask in my name, that will I do, that the
[37:11] Father may be glorified in the Son. And
[37:14] if you shall ask anything in my name, I
[37:18] will do it.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to read Psalms 46
[37:22] and10. And it says, "Be still and know
[37:25] that I am God."
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; You can be seated this evening.
[37:30] Be still and know that I am God. And so
[37:32] we see here in St. John chapter 14 in
[37:37] Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we would
[37:39] know not whether thou goest or how can
[37:42] we know the way? There's a junction here
[37:44] that is happening that he's going to
[37:46] leave his disciples. And he has a
[37:48] question. And I can only imagine that if
[37:50] you put yourselves there in the
[37:52] disciples shoes that this master that
[37:55] they've been following, this man that
[37:56] they've called Lord, the one the savior
[37:58] of the world that they've been
[37:59] following, he's telling them now that
[38:01] he's going to leave them and he's going
[38:03] to go. But now the question to them is
[38:07] where do we go?
[38:08] &gt;&gt; How do we know the way?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; What's next? What is going to happen?
[38:13] And I'm sure that that that was the
[38:14] question even when the prophet came and
[38:17] many followed him and you know they
[38:19] would follow this prophet of this hour
[38:21] and the word would come forth and they
[38:23] knew the things that he was speaking and
[38:25] the prophecies that he was saying and
[38:27] then the prophet goes off the scene and
[38:28] there now now there's a question of what
[38:31] next?
[38:32] &gt;&gt; What do we do? Where do we go?
[38:36] &gt;&gt; But yet Jesus says I am the way,
[38:39] &gt;&gt; the truth and the life.
[38:42] And here
[38:44] Philillip says and he asks Jesus he says
[38:49] show us the father and it'll suffice us.
[38:52] Show us who the father is and then we'll
[38:54] know. And he says Phillip have I not
[38:57] been with you so long? Have I not
[38:59] sojourned with you? Have I not shown
[39:01] these things? Have I not taught you my
[39:03] ways?
[39:06] &gt;&gt; And yet you don't know who I am.
[39:09] That begs the question of how many
[39:11] people are sitting in message churches
[39:13] that are sitting on pews and going to
[39:15] church day in and day out or they show
[39:17] up on a Wednesday and they're wondering,
[39:19] "Show us the father. Show us what's
[39:20] next. Show us where to go." And he's
[39:23] saying, "Have I not been with you so
[39:25] long? Have I not revealed myself to you?
[39:28] Have I not sent my word unto you and
[39:30] unfolded and made myself known unto
[39:32] you?"
[39:34] &gt;&gt; The problem isn't with the father
[39:36] revealing himself. is with us catching
[39:39] an understanding, a revelation of who he
[39:41] is.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Show us the father and it'll suffice us.
[39:52] You see, we have ones that have attended
[39:55] churches, sang in the choir. How can
[39:58] message people sojourn with us and come
[40:01] to church and a and fellowship with us?
[40:04] And then after so many years even
[40:06] preachers in the gospel and you see them
[40:08] faithful men of God held meetings,
[40:10] powerful ministries
[40:13] &gt;&gt; and they walk away.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Did they ever know him or was it an
[40:18] intellectual understanding of knowing
[40:20] who he was? Was it a thing that God gave
[40:24] them a gift and they would begin to
[40:25] preach the gospel where they can sing
[40:27] real well and they can do all these
[40:29] things for the kingdom of God, but yet
[40:31] they begin to take glory unto
[40:33] themselves.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; How do you walk away? Because let me ask
[40:40] you, if something is revealed unto you
[40:42] and you know who he is, how do you walk
[40:45] away from the truth? That's right.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; That ones that would try TO MISLEAD NOW
[40:50] THAT HAVE PREACHED the gospel and now
[40:52] they would hold meetings down away from
[40:54] a church or travel around to try to
[40:56] disprove. And if YOU HAVE A QUESTION
[40:58] WITH the message, come to this meeting.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Where are they taking you, saints?
[41:03] &gt;&gt; What is the purpose behind it all?
[41:05] Because if THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE
[41:07] GOING, HOW DO HOW do they know where
[41:10] they're taking you?
[41:12] Amen.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; They can't take you somewhere that
[41:15] they've never been or they don't know.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; But let us stick to the word of God
[41:20] that's been revealed unto us. He said,
[41:22] "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
[41:26] &gt;&gt; And as long as you stick with that, you
[41:28] know where you're going. You know the
[41:30] direction.
[41:33] that it's no longer a intellectual
[41:35] understanding or a human conception of
[41:38] knowing the father
[41:41] because you see people out in the world
[41:43] they have a limited understanding of who
[41:45] God is
[41:48] of who God is.
[41:51] And the title this evening would be the
[41:53] God I know.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; The God I know
[41:59] is the God I serve. Very
[42:03] good.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; And this thought came to me because I
[42:08] was talking with a man that was my age
[42:09] and we were just talking back and forth.
[42:14] And as I we we begin to just talk, you
[42:17] know, just about the world and things
[42:18] happening and all that, you know, what
[42:20] Trump's doing and all in a in a panic.
[42:23] If you don't you don't have a security
[42:25] in the message of the hour or knowing
[42:28] who God is, there's a fear and there's a
[42:30] worry that's happening around right now
[42:32] because they don't know what lays ahead.
[42:35] And whenever you come, you have men that
[42:37] raise up and you know that this guy,
[42:39] he's my age, he's a little bit younger,
[42:41] but he has kids. And you begin to
[42:43] understand and it's no longer just him
[42:45] and his wife, right? There's no longer
[42:47] just thinking you and her. But then
[42:49] whenever you have kids, you have a world
[42:51] that is going to be raised up and these
[42:53] kids are going to grow up under.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; The morals and the things of this world
[42:58] that you can't tell me that the people
[43:00] out there don't identify and can
[43:02] recognize the direction in which this
[43:04] world is headed.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; They know that there's a a condemnation
[43:09] coming. There's a destruction happening.
[43:11] That the morals being ripped out of
[43:13] society that it can't last going in this
[43:16] direction.
[43:20] And so we just began to talk and he he
[43:22] began to share just about how crazy the
[43:25] world is and you know the schools and
[43:26] his kids and you know the the classrooms
[43:30] that he you know the issues that are
[43:31] arising
[43:33] and I just threw something simple out. I
[43:35] just said well I'm thankful that I'm a
[43:37] Christian and I have somewhere that I'm
[43:40] headed.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; And he says oh you believe in that kind
[43:44] of stuff huh James?
[43:45] &gt;&gt; I said yeah I believe in God. you
[43:47] believe in God?
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; And he says, you know,
[43:52] I've never been raised in church. I've
[43:55] never understood and I've never been
[43:57] taught.
[43:58] And I begin to think about this because
[44:01] YOU CAN'T CONDEMN SOMEBODY WHO'S never
[44:03] been shown.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Be too many times we can get critical of
[44:08] the outside world and how dare they this
[44:10] and how they think this way or they're
[44:12] going in this and they've never been
[44:13] shown the truth. They've never been
[44:15] told.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; And so I just shared with him and he
[44:22] asked me, "Oh, you believe in God?" I
[44:24] said, "Yeah, I do." And I said, "Do you
[44:26] believe in him?"
[44:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "Well, I've never really, but
[44:31] now that I have a family," and he's
[44:33] like, "I know how you are and you're
[44:35] upright and you know, you do business
[44:38] right." He says, "You know, I I kind of
[44:40] admire that." And he says, "You going in
[44:44] this direction that I want to stick my
[44:45] family in a church. People out there are
[44:48] searching for church."
[44:51] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I want to raise my kids to
[44:53] do right, to know Bible stories, and to
[44:55] be able to understand and have good
[44:57] morals about them."
[45:01] And so I asked him, "How do you think
[45:02] you why are you here?" is what I asked
[45:05] him.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; And what is your purpose in being here?
[45:09] Because many times they want to ask well
[45:12] well do you believe in God and do you
[45:13] believe how do you believe in the big
[45:15] bang and do you believe in all these
[45:16] things but whenever you put it in their
[45:19] lap find out where they believe find out
[45:22] where they stand.
[45:24] So I asked him, "Why are you here and
[45:27] what purpose do you have here?"
[45:29] And he says, "Well, I guess as a man you
[45:32] want to have kids and you want to raise
[45:34] them right and have good morals and you
[45:36] want to lead a family and leave a
[45:38] legacy."
[45:39] I says, "That's exactly what God
[45:41] desires.
[45:44] That's exactly what God wants.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; That it's NOT A GOD JUST WAY out in the
[45:48] universe." And many TIMES THAT A GOD
[45:51] that they are taught or they are shown
[45:53] is some god out there that he created it
[45:56] or he didn't create it. And then AND YOU
[45:58] KNOW BACK TALKING BACK AND FORTH HE'S
[46:00] LIKE HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WE weren't
[46:01] created from a fungus?
[46:04] &gt;&gt; How do you know? And I said it's harder
[46:06] for me to believe that we came from a
[46:08] fungus than to believe that God created
[46:10] all of mankind.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; True.
[46:16] that I whenever you begin to take the
[46:18] simplicity of the nature and life and
[46:21] you begin to put it back in their lap
[46:23] and even the simple example of brother
[46:25] Brandham talking about trees and the
[46:27] intellect in the in the intelligence
[46:30] that what is in that fruit tree to bear
[46:33] forth that fruit
[46:35] &gt;&gt; at what TIME AND AT WHAT SEASON? WHY
[46:37] don't these fruits just bear FORTH ALL
[46:39] THE TIME? THERE'S A TIME and a season
[46:42] and there's a winter and ALL THESE
[46:43] THINGS. WHAT IS THE INTELLIGENCE THAT'S
[46:45] TAILING NATURE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS?
[46:48] DO YOU THINK IT'S SOME fungus that was
[46:50] created that has this intelligence to be
[46:53] able to do all that?
[46:55] &gt;&gt; It's impossible.
[46:57] But whenever you begin to put the
[46:59] simplicity of the gospel AND YOU BEGIN
[47:01] TO SHARE WITH THEM HOW SIMPLE THIS IS OF
[47:04] KNOWING A GOD THAT IT'S NOT SOMEBODY OUT
[47:07] THERE, IT'S NOT SOME RELIGION. IT'S NOT
[47:09] HOW MANY HELL MARYS I CAN SAY.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW MANY TIMES I GO TO CHURCH.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; It's not a religion, saints. But when
[47:20] you realize it's a love relationship
[47:22] with Jesus Christ, THAT WHEN THEY OUT
[47:25] THERE CAN IDENTIFY there's something
[47:27] different about this man,
[47:29] &gt;&gt; that this man truly knows God.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Because many times you ask them or
[47:38] somebody will ask you, they're ready for
[47:40] a religious answer.
[47:42] But whenever you take a natural example
[47:45] and you begin to explain it to them,
[47:48] their eyes become open, they begin to
[47:51] see and identify
[47:53] that that God is a God I can serve.
[48:02] That's exactly what God has desired
[48:06] is a family of fellowship that he had
[48:09] all these attributes
[48:11] all these things that were in him and
[48:14] many and he even asked me why why does
[48:18] good things h or bad things happen to
[48:20] good people?
[48:22] Why does God allow it?
[48:27] Even as we're sitting here tonight, my
[48:29] wife's cousin has two newborn babies
[48:33] that were born at a pound each,
[48:36] premature,
[48:38] and yet they're nursing them. And
[48:40] they're and you ask me, "How could I
[48:43] HAVE SUCH A A NORMAL BIRTH?" And I thank
[48:46] God for all of that. But yet, you take
[48:47] another situation and there's children
[48:50] that are being birthed into situations.
[48:52] There's things that are happening to
[48:53] good people. Why?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Why does cancer come upon a believer? Is
[48:58] it because they don't have enough faith?
[49:00] Is it because they did something that
[49:01] they didn't deserve? Or many times we
[49:04] begin to blame our things that we go
[49:06] through and we begin to wonder, God, is
[49:09] it me? Am I doing something wrong?
[49:14] But yet I found this quote
[49:16] and I know he says I'm going to approach
[49:18] it a little different from a standpoint
[49:20] coming to a place. He says why do we
[49:23] come?
[49:25] Why do we come to these troubles? What
[49:28] makes these things come? Why should a
[49:30] Christian ever be perplexed?
[49:32] Why would wouldn't not everything just
[49:35] run perfectly for a Christian?
[49:38] But it doesn't and we know it.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be nice?
[49:43] Wouldn't that be nice if our salvation
[49:44] once you come to Christ, you put it on
[49:46] cruise control,
[49:48] &gt;&gt; no battles, no worries.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Everything ran smooth. Everything was a
[49:52] paradise. Wouldn't that be nice?
[49:56] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we have more troubles when
[49:58] we come to when we become a Christian
[50:01] &gt;&gt; than we did when we were sinners. Of
[50:03] course, it is written, "Many is the
[50:04] afflictions of the righteous, but God
[50:07] deliverth them from them all." Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; God deliverth them from all saints. It
[50:12] don't matter your afflictions tonight
[50:15] you're going through. IT DON'T MATTER
[50:16] THE SICKNESS, THE CANCER. IT DON'T
[50:18] MATTER THE DOCTOR'S REPORT. GOD
[50:20] deliverth them from them all.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; God promised many afflictions, strange
[50:27] feelings, and strange things that would
[50:28] be beyond our understanding.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; But it's always done for our good. Wow.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Can't understand it because if we did
[50:38] then it would not be faith to us.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; We would go with an understanding. But
[50:43] we do it we and we have it and we
[50:45] believe by faith his word. That's that's
[50:49] it going to work some good in good thing
[50:53] for us.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; If we could grasp that all of our tr
[50:57] troubles there's none of us immune from
[51:00] them. Right?
[51:01] &gt;&gt; If we could realize that those things
[51:04] are for our good.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; None of us are immune from it, saints.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; That if you're going in one valley or
[51:11] you're coming out of a valley, there's
[51:13] always something that you're going TO GO
[51:14] THROUGH. YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE A
[51:16] battle that you're going to have to
[51:17] face. There's always going to be a trial
[51:19] coming your way.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; But when you know who God is, and when
[51:23] you know he he deliverth from from from
[51:27] us all, he he delivered every single one
[51:29] of them.
[51:32] It don't matter what comes our way. We
[51:35] know who holds tomorrow.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; That none of us were immune from it. We
[51:42] can look in the Bible that none not even
[51:44] the the great patriarchs of the Bible.
[51:47] We can look at all the prophets, the
[51:49] ones that would run in the midst of
[51:50] trouble, THE ONES THAT WOULD LIE AND
[51:52] THEY would steal and they would they
[51:54] would do all these things that you would
[51:56] think that wouldn't be coming to a
[51:57] Christian. And yet we read in OUR BIBLE
[52:00] THAT GOD WROTE AN IMPERFECT Bible or a a
[52:04] perfect Bible of imperfect people.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF GOD WROTE A
[52:11] BIBLE OF A PERFECT PEOPLE, THERE WAS ALL
[52:14] THESE AND Abraham did this and he never
[52:16] sinned and he never failed and Moses did
[52:19] this and he never faltered and he did
[52:22] this ONE DID THIS AND JOB worry and it
[52:24] was ALL GOOD.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; YOU AND I couldn't ATTAIN TO IT. YOU AND
[52:28] I COULDN'T RELATE TO IT. THERE WOULD be
[52:30] no relationship with his word because
[52:32] you couldn't identify with it
[52:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU DON'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT.
[52:37] BUT THEN WHEN THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT
[52:38] MAKES A MISTAKE AND THEY FALL DOWN, WHEN
[52:40] THEY FALL DOWN, THEY GET BACK UP. YOU
[52:42] CAN SAY, "THERE IT IS. THAT'S ME.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHO I AM. I MADE A MISTAKE. I
[52:48] KNOW I DID, BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. GET
[52:50] BACK UP."
[52:51] &gt;&gt; And he staggered not at the promise of
[52:53] God.
[52:55] Those are promises that you can identify
[52:57] with.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I see when I read my Bible.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Because if you look to find the the the
[53:05] perfection in it, it's hard to attain in
[53:07] it.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; But those that make mistakes,
[53:16] those that fall short,
[53:19] &gt;&gt; that's what your Bible is.
[53:22] I was listening to brother Brandham. He
[53:24] says, "God wrote an imperfect Bible or a
[53:28] perfect Bible with imperfect people,
[53:31] but he sent a perfect one by the
[53:34] shedding of his blood would make you and
[53:36] I perfect."
[53:40] &gt;&gt; THAT HE SMOKED THAT MASTERPIECE WHICH
[53:42] WAS CHRIST ON CALVARY. THAT IN SMITING
[53:45] THAT MASTERPIECE, NOT ONLY DID HE HE he
[53:48] smid that masterpiece, but then HE
[53:50] CREATED MANY MORE MASTERPIECE BY THE
[53:53] SHEDDING OF HIS BLOOD.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; That's the God I serve.
[54:07] Let's turn to Matthew 16.
[54:21] Matthew 16 and verse 13 he says when
[54:23] Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria
[54:25] Philippi and he asked his disciples whom
[54:28] do men say that I the son of man am and
[54:30] they answered him saying thou art John
[54:32] the Baptist and some Elias and others
[54:34] and Jeremas and one of the prophets and
[54:37] he saith unto them but whom do you say
[54:39] that I am? Amen.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Who do you say he is this evening?
[54:46] Is it dad's religion or mom's religion?
[54:48] Why are you here this evening?
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Who do you say he is?
[54:54] &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered, "Thou art
[54:56] Christ, the son of the living God." And
[54:59] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[55:01] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for
[55:03] flesh and blood hath not revealed this
[55:05] unto thee, but my father which is in
[55:07] heaven."
[55:09] And I said also unto thee, Thou art
[55:12] Simon Peter,
[55:14] and upon this rock I will build my
[55:16] church, and the gates of hell shall not
[55:19] prevail against it. And I will give thee
[55:21] the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and
[55:23] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth,
[55:25] thou shalt bound in heaven, and
[55:27] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[55:29] shall be loosed in heaven.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Do you understand when he said, "THOU
[55:34] ART CHRIST THE SON," WHO DO YOU SAY THIS
[55:36] IS? CHRIST ISN'T ONLY JUST ASKING a
[55:39] question just to ask FOR CONVERSATION
[55:41] PIECES. NO, HE'S ASKING THE QUESTION TO
[55:44] SEE if they understand,
[55:46] &gt;&gt; if they have a revelation of who he is.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Because you can ask the different ones
[55:51] and all the sayings of this of this
[55:53] message. Well, what is HIS PURPOSE? AND
[55:55] WHO IS BROTHER BRANDHAM? AND MAYBE SOME
[55:57] SAY HE'S THIS AND some say he's that,
[56:01] &gt;&gt; but who do you say Christ is? Yeah.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; What is this message to you?
[56:10] &gt;&gt; When you make it personal to yourself,
[56:15] not only is he saying flesh and blood
[56:18] hasn't revealed this unto you. No man
[56:20] gave you this revelation, Austin. I
[56:22] can't give you a revelation. BUT WHEN
[56:24] GOD REVEALS IT TO YOU your himself, when
[56:27] God comes down and makes himself known,
[56:30] WHEN HE SHOWS YOU personally who HE IS,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; NO MAN CAN TAKE THAT AWAY. BUT UPON THIS
[56:36] ROCK, NOT ONLY DID HE SAY THAT NO MAN
[56:39] CAN GIVE IT TO YOU, BUT HE SAYS, "THOU
[56:41] ART PETER." He doesn't not only tell him
[56:43] who he is, but he shows him who he is.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; He says, "Thou art Peter."
[56:50] And upon this rock of revelation, I'm
[56:52] going to build my church.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; As I said, people have a conception of
[57:02] God or what God is. And we know from the
[57:05] definition that God is an object of
[57:07] worship.
[57:09] And so that definition an object of
[57:12] worship that anything that we begin to
[57:14] worship anything that we give our praise
[57:16] to that we give our attention to it
[57:18] becomes a god unto us that if we don't
[57:21] give our time and AND OUR WORSHIP TO GOD
[57:24] HIMSELF then other things begin to take
[57:26] its place other idols begin to take its
[57:29] place
[57:31] &gt;&gt; things happen
[57:34] and you begin to worship other things
[57:36] and we be and SATAN TRIES TO DRAW our
[57:38] attention from worshiping the one true
[57:41] God.
[57:47] And if we apply it an object of worship,
[57:51] people who are worshiped in this day,
[57:55] ones that just begin to these people of
[57:58] sports stars and movie stars and ones
[58:00] that have an influence in in young
[58:03] people's lives, and they don't even
[58:04] realize that they're worshiping this
[58:07] God. They're giving this praise and
[58:09] attention that a man doesn't even they
[58:11] don't know him personally. They don't
[58:14] know his favorite meal. They don't know
[58:16] anything about this God other than they
[58:18] worship him for the thing he they he
[58:20] does for them. If he's a sports star,
[58:22] how many points can he get?
[58:28] And yet these people want to identify
[58:30] with their God. But does their God
[58:33] identify with them?
[58:35] Does their God identify with them?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; No. He can care less.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; He can care less if you follow him on
[58:44] Instagram. He can care less if you go to
[58:46] his games or his concert. He could care
[58:48] less
[58:50] &gt;&gt; because there's somebody else going to
[58:52] give him worship. There's somebody else
[58:54] going TO GIVE HIM PRAISE. SOMEBODY ELSE
[58:55] is going to pay THE DOLLAR TO GO watch
[58:57] him or to to SEE HIM SING OR WHATEVER it
[58:59] is.
[59:02] He could care less
[59:05] that God has no identification with you.
[59:09] But yet, our God is something totally
[59:12] different.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Our God is somebody totally different.
[59:16] Not only DOES HE WANT TO COME DOWN AND
[59:19] IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH YOU AND YOU
[59:22] IDENTIFY BACK to him,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; God wants to find his identification in
[59:33] you and I.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; He wants to identify with you.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; He wants to see if you are a son or a
[59:40] daughter of God. If you are living
[59:42] according to his ordinances,
[59:51] as long as these people
[59:54] and as long as the gods of this
[59:57] world, as long as they're getting paid
[1:00:00] the big bucks and the money's coming in,
[1:00:03] oh, they thank God. They know God. They
[1:00:06] know God. And they thank God. You can
[1:00:09] hear them at every award when they come
[1:00:11] forward. First, I want to thank God and
[1:00:13] then I want to thank my parents
[1:00:16] and my wife.
[1:00:18] But how much does God really mean to
[1:00:19] them?
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Do they really know who he is?
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Or is it just words that they say
[1:00:28] because
[1:00:29] humanly we know
[1:00:32] that there is a great God out there
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; who bestows his blessings upon us.
[1:00:38] But yet our return in our sacrifice in
[1:00:42] living for him and knowing him, it
[1:00:44] doesn't matter what he does for us, but
[1:00:47] it's what we can do for him.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; That them out there, IF THEY TOOK AWAY
[1:00:51] THE MONEY AND THEY TOOK AWAY THE FAME,
[1:00:53] WHERE would they be? WOULD THEY STILL
[1:00:56] THANK GOD in the condition that they're
[1:00:57] in?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; If they had to go BE A NORMAL PERSON,
[1:01:00] WOULD THEY STILL THANK God and him
[1:01:03] giving him those blessings?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or are they just thankful
[1:01:08] for the things that God has blessed them
[1:01:10] with?
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; But I know a God in Exodus 20 in verse
[1:01:22] 6. I am the Lord thy God which hath
[1:01:25] brought thee out of the land of Egypt
[1:01:27] out of the house of bondage.
[1:01:30] Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
[1:01:35] Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
[1:01:37] images or any likeness of anything that
[1:01:40] is in the heaven above or in the earth
[1:01:41] beneath or in the waters under the under
[1:01:44] the earth. And thou shalt not bow down
[1:01:47] thy thyself to them nor serve them. For
[1:01:50] I am the Lord thy God am jealous God.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; He's jealous saints. He's jealous over
[1:01:58] you with a godly jealousy.
[1:02:02] He's jealous over you.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; He's jealous in the way you dress,
[1:02:10] the way you conduct yourself.
[1:02:13] He's jealous in the way that you live
[1:02:15] your day in and your day out.
[1:02:22] He says, "Visiting the iniquities of the
[1:02:25] fathers upon the children under the
[1:02:26] third gen and fourth generation of them
[1:02:29] that hate hateth me and showing mercy
[1:02:33] unto thousands of them that love me and
[1:02:35] keep my commandments."
[1:02:38] What is iniquity?
[1:02:40] Knowing what's wrong, right, and not
[1:02:43] doing it.
[1:02:45] Do you understand the responsibility of
[1:02:48] us fathers
[1:02:50] even in this day that he's saying I I
[1:02:53] visited the iniquity of all those
[1:02:56] unto a second and third or third and
[1:02:58] fourth generation because of the
[1:03:00] iniquities of their fathers of the
[1:03:03] things that they knew what right to do
[1:03:04] and didn't do it.
[1:03:07] So then you see that there's a
[1:03:08] generation that's rising up under them
[1:03:11] UNDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF who what their
[1:03:13] fathers chose in knowing God or not
[1:03:16] knowing God in serving God or not
[1:03:17] serving God
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; because he's a jealous God and he's
[1:03:23] STILL SHOW BUT HE'S STILL showing mercy
[1:03:25] tonight and God not only wants to
[1:03:28] identify
[1:03:30] yourself with him but God wants to
[1:03:32] identify with you
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; and when he identifies with you in
[1:03:36] knowing a God, you better know what he
[1:03:39] likes and what he don't like.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; When you know somebody, you want to know
[1:03:44] what they like and what they don't like.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Because it's going to do you no good
[1:03:48] that if you take if I was to take my
[1:03:50] wife OUT AND AS MUCH AS I LOVE STEAK AND
[1:03:52] I TAKE MY WIFE OUT and I'm going to give
[1:03:54] you a the best dinner and I'm going to
[1:03:58] take you out and we're going to have a
[1:03:59] wonderful time and I take her to a
[1:04:01] steakhouse.
[1:04:06] Yes, I did a good deed, but my wife is
[1:04:09] not a steakhouse person.
[1:04:12] She doesn't like a steakhouse.
[1:04:16] So, do I really know her? Because in
[1:04:20] serving her, I want to KNOW WHAT SHE
[1:04:22] LIKES AND WHAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE. I WANT
[1:04:24] TO DO IT TO MY BEST ABILITY. IT'S NOT
[1:04:26] GOD JUST OUT THERE WANDERING and I'm
[1:04:29] going to serve God. But then we don't do
[1:04:31] the things he likes and doesn't like.
[1:04:40] a few things that I just began to find
[1:04:42] some scripture on that God loves a
[1:04:44] cheerful giver.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; God loves a cheerful giver. He loves
[1:04:49] those that love uh one another because
[1:04:51] he says in loving one another, you also
[1:04:54] love me.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVES TO PROVE HIS CHILDREN.
[1:05:01] But yet he loves to do it.
[1:05:05] But then we can find in the scripture in
[1:05:07] 2 Corinthians 9 and7
[1:05:10] or in Proverbs 6, he says, "These things
[1:05:13] does the Lord hate. Yay. Seven, an
[1:05:17] abomination unto him, a proud look, a
[1:05:20] lying tongue, hands that shed innocent
[1:05:23] blood,
[1:05:25] a heart that devisesth wicked
[1:05:27] imaginations, feet that be swift in
[1:05:30] running to mischief,
[1:05:33] a false witness that lith, and he that
[1:05:36] sweth discord among the brethren.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Discord.
[1:05:42] Yeah. He hates all the other attributes
[1:05:44] of sin, all those things. But look here,
[1:05:47] he hates a lying tongue.
[1:05:49] He hates a deceitful heart.
[1:05:52] He hates one that is going around
[1:05:54] spreading gossip one with his brother.
[1:05:58] Those things the Lord thy God hateth.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose in reading this
[1:06:04] because whenever you identify, if you
[1:06:06] really want to go get to know somebody,
[1:06:08] find out what they don't like.
[1:06:21] You see, his word is a road map on how
[1:06:24] we can find ways that we can love him
[1:06:26] back and reflect our love.
[1:06:31] And in Matthew 7 and 21, he says, ' Not
[1:06:33] everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,
[1:06:35] shall enter into his kingdom, the
[1:06:37] kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the
[1:06:40] will of my father which is in heaven.
[1:06:43] Many will say unto me, in that day,
[1:06:46] Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
[1:06:49] thy name? In thy name cast out devils,
[1:06:52] and in thy name done many wonderful
[1:06:54] works.
[1:06:56] And then will I profess unto them, I
[1:06:58] never knew you. Depart from me, you
[1:07:00] workers of iniquity.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; You workers of iniquity. Ones they
[1:07:06] thought they knew. They knew who God
[1:07:08] was. They thought they were serving God
[1:07:10] to the best of their ability. They maybe
[1:07:12] it's a denominational path. He's doing
[1:07:15] everything that he can.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; He's serving God. He's doing good deeds.
[1:07:20] And from an outward natural uh uh
[1:07:22] viewpoint, you would say that that is a
[1:07:24] man of God.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; He's doing everything for the kingdom.
[1:07:29] He's faithful. He's true. He's doing all
[1:07:31] these things. HE'S HE HAS A GOOD, SOLID
[1:07:33] church
[1:07:38] and he thinks he knows God,
[1:07:41] but yet when it comes to that judgment
[1:07:43] day and he says, "Lord, Lord, didn't I
[1:07:46] do all these works? Didn't I do all
[1:07:47] these wonders? Didn't I do didn't I
[1:07:49] didn't I raise up the lame? Didn't I do
[1:07:51] all these miracles in your name?"
[1:07:55] And he says, "Depart from me. I never
[1:07:57] knew you.
[1:07:59] I never knew you. And this word knew,
[1:08:01] we're going to get into it.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Workers of iniquity. But he says here in
[1:08:06] the Patm
[1:08:09] Pergamian churches, he says, "Then will
[1:08:11] I profess unto them, I never knew you.
[1:08:13] Depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
[1:08:16] Jesus did not deny that they did the
[1:08:18] mighty works that only the Holy Ghost
[1:08:20] can accomplish by the way of men. But he
[1:08:23] did deny ever knowing them.
[1:08:26] These weren't backsliders. These were
[1:08:28] wicked, ungenerated reprobate. These
[1:08:30] were the seed of Satan.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And there it is. He says, "You can't
[1:08:35] claim that manifestation
[1:08:37] is the evidence of being spirit born,
[1:08:40] spiritfilled." No, sir. He says, "I will
[1:08:42] admit that that true manifestation is
[1:08:45] the evidence of the Holy Ghost, Holy
[1:08:47] Spirit doing mighty acts." He says, "It
[1:08:50] is not the evidence of the individual
[1:08:52] being spiritfilled." Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Even though that individual has an
[1:08:57] abundance of those manifestations,
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; be careful, saints. Do you understand
[1:09:02] what he's saying here?
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Just because you do all the wonderful
[1:09:07] things of God and you can get a minister
[1:09:09] and YOU CAN PREACH THE HOUSE, HE CAN DO
[1:09:11] ALL THE MIRACLES,
[1:09:14] he won't deny THAT IT WAS SPIRIT, HOLY
[1:09:17] GHOST FILLED BECAUSE ONLY GOD CAN DO
[1:09:19] THOSE KIND of things.
[1:09:24] The evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:09:26] today is just the same as it was in the
[1:09:29] day back in the day of our Lord. It is
[1:09:31] receiving the word of truth for that day
[1:09:34] in which you live.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus never did stress the importance of
[1:09:39] the work as he did the word. He knew,
[1:09:42] listen to what God knew. He knew that if
[1:09:45] the people got the word that the works
[1:09:47] would follow. That's the Bible.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; So, let me tell you this evening, I
[1:09:57] DON'T HAVE TO GET YOU TO THE WORKS. I
[1:09:59] DON'T HAVE TO GET YOU TO GET WORKED UP
[1:10:00] AND TO WONDER AND GET ALL THESE
[1:10:02] MANIFESTATIONS HAPPENING AMONGST US. NO,
[1:10:04] I JUST GOT TO GET YOU TO THE WORD. And
[1:10:07] when THE WORD WILL BRING ALL THOSE
[1:10:09] MANIFESTATIONS.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; The Hebrew word yada it means to know
[1:10:21] but it signifies a deep intimate
[1:10:23] relational
[1:10:25] knowledge not just an intellectual fact
[1:10:30] but encompassing understanding
[1:10:32] experiencing and being known. You see
[1:10:35] this word yada as I begin to look into
[1:10:37] this word yada as you begin to look in
[1:10:39] throughout the scripture that it pops up
[1:10:41] even in Genesis 4 and1 and it's and it
[1:10:44] says and Adam knew Eve his wife and she
[1:10:47] conceived.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; It's not an intellectual knowledge. It's
[1:10:51] not there's got to be something to this
[1:10:53] knowing than just knowing of A PERSON
[1:10:55] BECAUSE IF I think of a person it
[1:10:57] doesn't bring some kind of conception.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; But there's a deeper meaning to this
[1:11:02] word of
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; yada.
[1:11:05] THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMEBODY PERSONAL.
[1:11:07] YOU HAVE TO BE INTIMATE with them. You
[1:11:09] have to have a relationship with them.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; You can't have a a conception or
[1:11:17] intellectual
[1:11:18] knowledge of of the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:22] Ghost. YOU CAN'T HAVE SOME REVELATION
[1:11:24] OF, OH, I MIGHT HAVE THE Holy Ghost and
[1:11:26] I might not. Why? Because if it's an
[1:11:27] intellectual uh understanding, let me
[1:11:30] tell you, YOU'LL BE UP ONE day and out
[1:11:32] the next. True.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; A hard day comes and you'll wonder if
[1:11:36] you got it and the next day you won't.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; But yet when you know when you yada when
[1:11:44] you have an INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WHEN
[1:11:47] GOD HAS COME DOWN AND HE'S REVEALED
[1:11:49] himself unto you and you back to him, it
[1:11:52] don't matter what comes, saints.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; It don't matter the day, the hour. It
[1:11:56] don't matter the trial.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you know,
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; and when you know something, nobody can
[1:12:06] talk you out of it.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Nobody can persuade you. Nobody can sway
[1:12:10] you. Why? Because you've met the person
[1:12:13] of Jesus Christ himself.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; You can't have a new birth experience
[1:12:23] intellectually.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; But it is in knowing him. It is in
[1:12:28] yotting him. Yaying Christ. knowing him
[1:12:32] personally
[1:12:35] in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:12:37] revealed. He says now God's secret
[1:12:39] mystery he had before the found the
[1:12:42] world began. He says now back in the
[1:12:45] back part of God's mind there was
[1:12:46] something that he was trying and was
[1:12:49] going to achieve. He had a a a motive in
[1:12:52] doing it in order to let himself be
[1:12:54] expressed because first there was there
[1:12:56] wasn't a moon or star, atom, molecule,
[1:13:00] anything, not even a fungus.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; He was God.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; He was God.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; But he exactly wasn't at that time
[1:13:13] because God is an object of worship and
[1:13:16] there wasn't nothing to worship.
[1:13:20] And so in his great mind, he wanted
[1:13:22] these attributes to be expressed.
[1:13:25] And in him was love. And in him was
[1:13:27] father. In him was son. And in him was
[1:13:29] savior. And in him was to be a healer.
[1:13:32] And all these great attributes that we
[1:13:34] see already expressed. They were in God.
[1:13:37] What a wonderful thing it is that in God
[1:13:40] he had all these things and all these
[1:13:42] desires. And yet even some of these
[1:13:44] attributes, he come and he gave you
[1:13:46] those attributes.
[1:13:48] YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW it
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; that in you there's a desire if you're
[1:13:54] unmarried to be a father or to be a
[1:13:56] mother that in you there's a desire to
[1:13:58] be a father.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; That right now it doesn't even enter
[1:14:03] your your intellectual or your
[1:14:05] understanding right now
[1:14:08] but yet in due SEASON WHEN THE TIME IS
[1:14:10] RIGHT AND YOU HAVE YOUR SOULMATE AND GOD
[1:14:13] HAS AN APPOINTED TIME FOR THAT TO
[1:14:14] HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENS? an attribute out
[1:14:17] of you becomes revealed
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; because you have this desire
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; and you begin to understand the very
[1:14:24] desire of almighty God.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; That in him
[1:14:31] was all these attributes
[1:14:34] and he wanted to express it but he had
[1:14:36] nobody to share it with.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He had no way to reveal himself to.
[1:14:49] What was once a mystery or a question
[1:14:53] God has made known himself
[1:14:57] revealing in how he would come down and
[1:15:00] it's our responsibility
[1:15:02] to find out
[1:15:05] what he likes and what he doesn't like.
[1:15:09] It's our responsibility
[1:15:16] to create atmospheres within our homes
[1:15:19] and within our lives that we can nurture
[1:15:21] that relationship that if you don't ever
[1:15:23] give God the time of day, how could he
[1:15:26] ever come down and talk to you?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; How could you ever fall in love with
[1:15:30] somebody you do not know?
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; But it is a desire to make himself known
[1:15:34] unto you personally.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's our responsibility to
[1:15:39] know how he loves and how we can love
[1:15:41] him back.
[1:15:44] And I love this quote. He says what we
[1:15:47] yet to see. He says, "You can't help
[1:15:49] what you are. Even if you're a sinner,
[1:15:52] you're not responsible for being a
[1:15:54] sinner. You're responsible for remaining
[1:15:57] a sinner.
[1:15:59] That if YOU STAY IN THAT CURRENT
[1:16:00] CONDITION, God has made a provided way.
[1:16:03] But if you stay in that sinner's
[1:16:05] condition, that's when you become
[1:16:07] responsible.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; There is a provided way. But to be
[1:16:16] a sinner, you was born that way. God
[1:16:19] doesn't send you to hell for being a
[1:16:21] sinner. God sends you to hell because
[1:16:23] you won't repent and take Christ as your
[1:16:25] savior.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; You refuse to take the right road.
[1:16:30] He says, "You send yourself to torment.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; You send your own soul to its eternal
[1:16:35] destination upon free moral agency of
[1:16:38] your own convictions."
[1:16:40] God doesn't send anyone to hell. He
[1:16:42] never did and he never will. Man sends
[1:16:44] themselves to hell because they refuse
[1:16:47] to accept the way of salvation.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; He's longsuffering. Doesn't want any
[1:16:52] anyone to perish. Never wanted it.
[1:16:55] Right.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; We're not responsible
[1:17:00] that we were born in sin, shaped in
[1:17:01] iniquity, come into the world, speaking
[1:17:03] lies, THAT WE HAVE A SINNER'S NATURE,
[1:17:06] AND WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE for being a
[1:17:08] sinner. But if we remain a sinner, then
[1:17:10] it becomes our responsibility.
[1:17:13] And let me tell you this evening that
[1:17:15] YOU WEREN'T RESPONSIBLE TO KNOW IF THERE
[1:17:17] WAS A GOD OR NOT GOD OR WHAT WHAT WAS
[1:17:19] OUT THERE. BUT when you come to the
[1:17:21] knowledge OF ALMIGHTY GOD, NOW YOU
[1:17:23] BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR KNOWING how he is
[1:17:26] and learning how to serve him.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; It's your responsibility.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; You see, the problem is that people
[1:17:42] don't know God.
[1:17:44] Let's say the God of the Bible.
[1:17:47] Because what happens
[1:17:50] over many generations and over church
[1:17:52] ages and things the viewpoint of God or
[1:17:55] the person of God becomes warped. How
[1:17:58] does it become warped? By man's ideas,
[1:18:01] by man's interpretations.
[1:18:03] That man puts a creed in and a dogma and
[1:18:05] a a denomination and then you have all
[1:18:08] these different denominations
[1:18:10] that come forth. Why? Because God the
[1:18:13] people have changed God into what they
[1:18:15] want him to be. They want a religion
[1:18:17] that works best for them.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; And so people don't know really the God
[1:18:23] of the Bible.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; They don't know the things that God
[1:18:28] hates. Because if you if you preach the
[1:18:30] thing God hates and you begin to condemn
[1:18:32] the people and put it back in their lap
[1:18:34] and don't do these things, what happens?
[1:18:36] They'll find a church that only preaches
[1:18:38] that the things that God loves.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to find me a church that
[1:18:43] preaches only love.
[1:18:47] But you see, we come to church to a fine
[1:18:49] things in our lives. And I say, "God,
[1:18:51] help us.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Help us identify the things. God, if
[1:18:55] there's something in my life that you
[1:18:56] hate, if there's something that I'm
[1:18:58] doing, maybe and I don't even know and
[1:19:00] it's subconsciously or maybe it's a
[1:19:02] friend or I'm giving somebody a look, a
[1:19:04] proud look,
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; a proud look,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; and you DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S HAPPENING."
[1:19:12] But yet SOMETIMES IN OUR SELF-RIGHTEOUS
[1:19:14] ATTITUDES THAT GOD SAVED US AND HE
[1:19:16] redeemed us and you take a proud look of
[1:19:18] somebody sitting over there on the curb.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Begin to judge that sinner. But if it
[1:19:24] wasn't for the grace of almighty God,
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; that people know a God, but this God is
[1:19:38] is is through the lens of their
[1:19:40] religion.
[1:19:42] That the God that they created is based
[1:19:44] upon beliefs and things that they begin
[1:19:46] to agree on or disagree on or leave
[1:19:48] alone. Do we do we baptize or do we
[1:19:50] sprinkle? Do we have gifts or no gifts?
[1:19:53] Do we do these things or there's so many
[1:19:56] questions?
[1:19:58] It's so man-made. They they make this
[1:20:00] God that works for them.
[1:20:03] They be begin to use Bibles that they
[1:20:05] can understand as NIV and all whatever
[1:20:08] it may be. They begin to make it easier
[1:20:10] for the people. They begin to do customs
[1:20:12] and traditions and holidays
[1:20:15] and all these things that they can
[1:20:16] incorporate into their religion.
[1:20:22] today. I haven't heard any of you tell
[1:20:24] me merry Christmas.
[1:20:27] You say, "What are you talking about?" I
[1:20:29] didn't know it either till yesterday.
[1:20:32] I was at my shop and a mechanic and I
[1:20:34] went over there and a guy's, you know,
[1:20:36] they were talking back and forth and
[1:20:38] they're both Russian
[1:20:40] and he was like, "Are you going to
[1:20:41] church tonight?" The guy's like, "Yeah,
[1:20:42] I'm going to church." I said, "What do
[1:20:44] you guys believe?" "Oh, we're Russian
[1:20:46] Orthodox Christians." And I was like,
[1:20:48] "Okay." I said, "What's going on? What?"
[1:20:50] And he's like, "Well, Christmas is
[1:20:51] tomorrow."
[1:20:54] Because according to the Julian
[1:20:55] calendar, it's not the Gregorian
[1:20:57] calendar. It's 14 days behind or
[1:20:59] whatever it is, seven days. So today is
[1:21:02] Christmas. So if you want to celebrate
[1:21:04] Christmas not according to the
[1:21:06] traditions of other Christmases, you can
[1:21:08] celebrate this week.
[1:21:12] But do you understand that they are
[1:21:14] going based upon a calendar? that they
[1:21:17] stayed according to their religion,
[1:21:19] according to their god, according to the
[1:21:21] the way that they're so now they're in
[1:21:23] this world over here in America and
[1:21:25] they're ch, you know, they changed. Now
[1:21:27] the new year hasn't even happened
[1:21:29] because it's got to come after, right?
[1:21:30] So new year hasn't even happened.
[1:21:33] But people begin to understand a god
[1:21:36] based upon their religion.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; That if your god becomes your church and
[1:21:40] your god becomes the people and and
[1:21:42] madmade thinking,
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; that's not the god I serve.
[1:21:51] But they were raised under that.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; And if you make your church or a man the
[1:21:56] absolute, then you only know God through
[1:22:00] those lens.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; If you make a church an absolute, well,
[1:22:04] they only do this and we're only going
[1:22:06] to do it and that's it.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; That's the absolute. Well, is that what
[1:22:10] God said?
[1:22:12] or we base in our opinions and our
[1:22:14] religions and different things that we
[1:22:15] do based upon an opinion or whatever it
[1:22:18] is. But I want to stick to the God of
[1:22:21] the Bible.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; And you see these ones and I have a
[1:22:27] heart for those people because many
[1:22:29] people, they're raised up under a
[1:22:31] religion. They're raised up under
[1:22:32] something THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA who God
[1:22:35] really is. that if they're raised up in
[1:22:38] a message home or OR A TAPED HOUSE AND I
[1:22:42] HAVE FAMILY THAT IS RAISED UP UNDER THAT
[1:22:44] and you talk TO THE KIDS AND THAT'S WHAT
[1:22:46] they believe because that's all that
[1:22:49] they know. That's all that they've been
[1:22:51] ingrained in them that this is what
[1:22:52] we're going to do and this is how we're
[1:22:54] going TO DO IT. SO, HOW CAN I CRITICIZE
[1:22:56] the kids if they're raised up under that
[1:22:58] way? That's right.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; But my heart goes OUT TO HIM BECAUSE
[1:23:02] I'VE HAD IT WHERE YOU CAN REACH OUT A
[1:23:04] hand and you just ask the question.
[1:23:08] When you begin to ask questions,
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; you will get true answers from children
[1:23:15] or from kids.
[1:23:18] Because let me say this tonight. We are
[1:23:21] blessed that we I was born and raised in
[1:23:24] a message home
[1:23:26] with a solid pastor in a good church.
[1:23:29] That I was blessed to be brought up
[1:23:32] under that atmosphere.
[1:23:34] But yet many times young people can hide
[1:23:36] under that atmosphere.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; They're not exposed yet because they've
[1:23:42] never been asked, "Well, what do you
[1:23:44] believe?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; What does this prophet mean to you?
[1:23:49] Do you believe in pressing play or do
[1:23:51] you believe in listening to tapes at
[1:23:53] home?
[1:23:55] Do you do these things? But as message
[1:23:57] people, we can hide so much more because
[1:24:00] if they're out there in a doctrine or or
[1:24:02] seven thunders or whatever the doctrine
[1:24:04] is. Well, oh, we can identify that's
[1:24:07] they're over there.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; But let me ask you, sitting in a message
[1:24:13] church, do you know who God is?
[1:24:26] God is in his word. He says, "Brother,
[1:24:27] it's not eternal life to know your
[1:24:29] church. It's not eternal life to know
[1:24:32] the Somebody help me out.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Catechism.
[1:24:38] It's not eternal life to know all your
[1:24:40] church's teachings.
[1:24:43] It's not eternal life to know or it's
[1:24:46] Yeah. It's not eternal life to know the
[1:24:48] Bible. To know him
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; to know him
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; is eternal life.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can know him is
[1:25:00] being born again of his spirit.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; To know him is eternal life. Because you
[1:25:07] can memorize the scriptures, you can
[1:25:08] quote the quotes, and you can do all
[1:25:10] these things, but if you don't know
[1:25:12] Jesus Christ himself,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; it does you no good. That's not eternal
[1:25:16] life. If you can do all those things,
[1:25:18] but you got to know him.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; That the depth of people that knowing
[1:25:29] God is the savior is the depth that
[1:25:31] they'll ever know.
[1:25:33] that John 3:16 that God sent a savior to
[1:25:36] the world and that's the only God that
[1:25:38] they'll know because people only
[1:25:40] identify God in a time of need. And I've
[1:25:42] said it before that God they only
[1:25:44] identify a God in the time of need. That
[1:25:47] if something happens then they'll say,
[1:25:49] "Oh, there is a God or God saved me from
[1:25:51] this." BUT LET ME ASK YOU, DOES GOD HEAL
[1:25:53] people out there?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. Does he does he UH FROM A
[1:25:59] TRAGIC ACCIDENT? Does he uh uh heal
[1:26:01] people from a tragic accident?
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. But do they know him?
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; But yet that's who God is.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Is because he says, "I would that no man
[1:26:17] perish."
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being God? So it's not
[1:26:22] our responsibility to have that kind of
[1:26:25] understanding of who God is.
[1:26:28] that if it's a shallow base that I only
[1:26:30] know him as a savior that if he's good
[1:26:32] to me or I serve a god in denominational
[1:26:34] churches are full
[1:26:37] but they don't really know the God of
[1:26:39] the Bible in the depth in which you know
[1:26:44] but it's not their responsibility to
[1:26:46] know
[1:26:47] but unto you who are called unto you who
[1:26:51] are chosen unto you who God seen fit to
[1:26:53] elect and reveal and give you revelation
[1:26:56] and understanding of who he is now
[1:26:58] responsibility is on you
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; to know who he is.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Let me get to this.
[1:27:14] It is up for us, up to us to know him
[1:27:16] deeper in a more personal way.
[1:27:20] And it came to me there today that
[1:27:25] the God your kids know is the God who
[1:27:27] you teach and show him who he is.
[1:27:34] The God your kids know because on the
[1:27:38] age of accountability, they're going to
[1:27:40] be watching how you are. How do you
[1:27:42] serve your wife? How do you love your
[1:27:44] brother? How do you how do you serve God
[1:27:46] back to him? Yeah.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Do they run into the room and they find
[1:27:49] you on your knees or reading your Bible?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:27:53] Do they see daddy and mommy have
[1:27:55] devotional time or or even you know dad
[1:27:58] coming in and and see him reading his
[1:28:00] Bible
[1:28:05] because they only know
[1:28:08] the God that you
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; because my son Nolan four years old he's
[1:28:15] not going to know God in the direction
[1:28:17] he isn't going to know his personal
[1:28:19] savior he does that that'll be later
[1:28:21] down the road Right.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; BUT WE WANT TO SHOW them stepping
[1:28:25] stones.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Son, you say your good night prayer.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; You tell God what you're thankful for.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm thankful for my toys.
[1:28:36] I'm thankful for the good food that they
[1:28:38] brought us today.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; But yet, that's the God he knows. He's
[1:28:44] he's giving back. He's he's returning
[1:28:46] something in the in the simplicity
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; of loving God. What are you teaching
[1:28:51] them? What are you showing them?
[1:28:57] Those little things
[1:29:01] that you won't even know
[1:29:04] that comes to a kid's mind
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; whenever he begins to pray
[1:29:11] that he even brag on him a little bit.
[1:29:15] He sees sister Linda fall in the pastor
[1:29:17] appreciation and for weeks guess who was
[1:29:20] in his prayer
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; and bless sister Linda
[1:29:28] and for weeks
[1:29:31] and finally I had to say son guess what
[1:29:34] the Lord's healed her
[1:29:38] he did yeah goes and see he does she
[1:29:40] doesn't have a cast no more
[1:29:43] but yet these kids are picking up
[1:29:45] things. What is it you're teaching them
[1:29:47] and you're showing them? This is who God
[1:29:49] is. He's not some object of we got to
[1:29:51] come and and say your prayer. Son, get
[1:29:53] down and pray.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; No, that's not how you teach your kid.
[1:29:56] Why don't you get down and pray with
[1:29:57] them?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Why don't you show them how
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; don't you show them how to do a
[1:30:03] devotion?
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; That's teaching God to your kids.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Very good.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; And that's the God that they will know.
[1:30:21] The God they know is the God you show
[1:30:24] him.
[1:30:26] On a scriptural example, you can see
[1:30:28] that Abraham
[1:30:30] whenever he took Isaac up into the
[1:30:32] mountain, he said, "I and the lad will
[1:30:34] return." He had faith that he would
[1:30:35] return. He knew the Lord would provide.
[1:30:38] He knew he was Jehovah Gyra. He didn't
[1:30:40] know how. He didn't know when, but it
[1:30:42] was a profession and it was a confession
[1:30:44] out loud that I and the lad will return.
[1:30:46] But let me ask you, as a boy, a little
[1:30:48] Isaac going up the mountain, do you
[1:30:50] think he knew Jehovah Gyra? Do you think
[1:30:52] he knew God is Jehovah Gyra? The Lord
[1:30:55] will provide himself a sacrifice. He had
[1:30:57] probably had no idea.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; But he's going up THE MOUNTAIN AND HE'S
[1:31:02] WALKING UP. DADDY, WHERE ARE WE GOING?
[1:31:04] WHERE ARE we going, son? We got to go
[1:31:05] and we got to offer a sacrifice.
[1:31:08] But the Lord will provide himself a
[1:31:10] sacrifice. And he's telling Isaac as
[1:31:13] he's walking up, the Lord's going to
[1:31:15] provide. Daddy, I don't see anything
[1:31:16] around here, but he's going to provide.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Isaac didn't have a revelation. He God
[1:31:23] never revealed unto him yet Jehovah
[1:31:26] Gyra. The attribute of Jehovah Gyra.
[1:31:32] But yet there was coming a time THAT YOU
[1:31:34] CAN'T TELL ME THAT WHENEVER Abraham
[1:31:36] laying upon the sacrifice or upon THE
[1:31:38] ALTAR READY TO BE SACRIFICED AND HIS
[1:31:41] HANDS were tied and HE WAS SAYING,
[1:31:42] "DADDY, BUT YOU SAID and he's laying
[1:31:45] there bound
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden a bleeding of a a
[1:31:50] ram over in the thicket."
[1:31:54] Let me tell you, did Isaac know then who
[1:31:57] Jehovah Gyra was?
[1:32:01] You bet he did. He knew exactly who
[1:32:03] Jehovah Gyra was.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; That Abraham didn't say, "Hey, this is
[1:32:07] God and this is this is an attribute
[1:32:09] that he wants to express unto you." But
[1:32:12] yet Isaac knew personally this is
[1:32:16] Jehovah Gyra.
[1:32:25] He says in Jehovah, he says God
[1:32:29] has seven compound redemptive names.
[1:32:31] Those redemptive names are inseparable.
[1:32:34] You can't separate one from the other.
[1:32:37] You can't separate one from the other.
[1:32:39] You can't have this one without this
[1:32:41] one. Give me the the seven redemptive
[1:32:43] names. So, we see these seven redemptive
[1:32:46] names, if we have them. the seven
[1:32:48] redemptive names that God in his great
[1:32:51] mercy and all of his goodness and
[1:32:53] everything that he bestowed upon us in
[1:32:55] order to reveal himself that he would
[1:32:57] come in such ways that he would have
[1:32:59] redemptive names that he would begin to
[1:33:01] express himself to his people.
[1:33:04] That there's times in our lives that we
[1:33:06] become more attached to a redemptive
[1:33:09] NAME THAT WE DRAW CLOSE and we draw
[1:33:11] virtue
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; out of those redemptive names. BE BUT
[1:33:16] YOU GOT TO KNOW WHO GOD IS
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU JUST DON'T PRAY LET ME TELL YOU
[1:33:20] MAKE GOD PERSONAL TO you that it's just
[1:33:23] not God I asked you for this and I asked
[1:33:25] you to this no WHEN YOU REALLY KNOW WHO
[1:33:28] HE IS and you have a need and you need a
[1:33:30] HEALING IN YOUR BODY YOU SAY GOD I NEED
[1:33:33] I NEED JEHOVAH RAFA I NEED HIM TO COME
[1:33:36] and I need to be my portion
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; do you understand how personal that is
[1:33:45] Yeah.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN SOMEBODY ADDRESSES YOU
[1:33:48] PERSONALLY THAT IT'S just not God, help
[1:33:50] me do this, that, that's not real
[1:33:52] personal,
[1:33:55] but when you say, "God,
[1:33:57] I have a need in my life.
[1:34:01] That I need you to be Jehovah Gyra. That
[1:34:04] I need you to come down and need you to
[1:34:07] provide. I have a situation in my life.
[1:34:18] Jehovah Shalom
[1:34:21] in the time of peace.
[1:34:24] How many times do we get worked up in
[1:34:26] life and cares of life
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; and we just need the peace of God
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; to come and to comfort us
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; and to tell a son it's going to be okay.
[1:34:39] Daughter it's going to be okay. I know
[1:34:41] the world is falling apart and I know
[1:34:43] that this burden is upon your life and
[1:34:45] maybe it's a sickness and it's something
[1:34:47] that you're going under or news from the
[1:34:49] doctor and you don't know what tomorrow
[1:34:51] holds
[1:34:53] but you just need the peace of God to
[1:34:55] come.
[1:35:00] We have to draw from those redemptive
[1:35:02] names.
[1:35:05] He says, "Now Jehovah appeared in the
[1:35:06] Old Testament in the seven compound
[1:35:08] redemptive names and those names of
[1:35:10] Jehovah. Jehovah's attitude towards his
[1:35:13] people. Each one of those expresses what
[1:35:16] Jehovah is to his people. Whatever he is
[1:35:21] to his people, he appears in those res
[1:35:24] redemptive compound names.
[1:35:30] whatever he is to his people that
[1:35:33] there's times in our lives that we go
[1:35:36] through hard times.
[1:35:39] Saints, if we you're going through a
[1:35:41] sickness that is unbearable and you need
[1:35:43] God, maybe it's a death sentence, maybe
[1:35:45] it's something
[1:35:48] and there's no way out.
[1:35:51] God is going to draw closer unto you and
[1:35:54] these redemptive names of healer
[1:35:58] and comforter.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. But you have to draw from them. You
[1:36:02] have to pull that out of him. You have
[1:36:04] to know exactly. He's wanting to give
[1:36:07] you more than you want.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; He's such a personal God.
[1:36:25] musicians come
[1:36:29] that when you know him,
[1:36:33] you know how to serve him. And when you
[1:36:36] know how to serve him, you know how to
[1:36:37] love him.
[1:36:41] And when you love him, there's something
[1:36:43] about it
[1:36:53] You know, God is depending upon you and
[1:36:56] he's relying on you to draw from that
[1:37:00] fountain,
[1:37:01] to draw from him, to draw those things
[1:37:04] out.
[1:37:09] And Paul says
[1:37:12] that I want to know Christ in the power
[1:37:15] of his resurrection.
[1:37:18] That I want to know him like Job. I want
[1:37:21] to know him.
[1:37:28] That I want to know that my redeemer
[1:37:30] liveth.
[1:37:32] That though these skin worms,
[1:37:36] Lord, though you take everything,
[1:37:41] saints, have you crossed that line?
[1:37:48] Family,
[1:37:50] materialistic things.
[1:37:55] And yet Job could say, "I know.
[1:38:00] I know my redeemer liveth. I yought my
[1:38:04] redeemer.
[1:38:06] Why? Because I know him personally.
[1:38:30] The same God
[1:38:34] that appeared to Abraham as Jehovah
[1:38:37] Gyra.
[1:38:39] You can find it all the way down through
[1:38:41] scripture.
[1:38:43] But that same God, Jehovah Gyra, is
[1:38:45] still here tonight.
[1:38:51] Jehovah Rafa
[1:38:59] saints. That's the God I serve.
[1:39:02] That's the God I know.
[1:39:05] And when you know him in the power of
[1:39:07] his resurrection,
[1:39:10] it don't matter what comes our way. It
[1:39:12] don't matter what the future holds. You
[1:39:14] know who holds it.
[1:39:16] And you know, our lives are in the palm
[1:39:18] of his hand.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; And we could rest assured in those
[1:39:24] promises
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; that the same God that met Moses on the
[1:39:31] back side of the desert in the form of a
[1:39:33] pillar of fire,
[1:39:37] that pillar of fire is still here
[1:39:39] tonight.
[1:39:44] He took a picture with our prophet to
[1:39:46] say, "This is the vindicated man. This
[1:39:49] is him. This is the voice. Listen to
[1:39:51] what he has to say."
[1:39:58] And I'm so thankful,
[1:40:04] saints. We can't know him enough.
[1:40:09] We can't search his word enough. We
[1:40:11] can't listen enough
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; to identify
[1:40:16] because when you know who he is, you
[1:40:19] know who you are.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; When you know who he is, saints, and you
[1:40:25] know the power
[1:40:28] that is within you.
[1:40:34] I was listening the other day. He says
[1:40:36] we God has enough power
[1:40:40] but we just need the authority when to
[1:40:43] use that power.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; God has all the power. We just need the
[1:40:48] authority that authority to come when to
[1:40:50] say and when to speak.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this together. Jehovah Gyra.
[1:41:05] over child
[1:41:12] my
[1:41:19] you are
[1:41:24] done
[1:41:27] for for
[1:41:37] your healer this evening. You're my
[1:41:41] healer
[1:41:46] and by your stripes
[1:41:51] I am
[1:41:54] set free.
[1:41:59] Hold your hope.
[1:42:07] You are way of thinking.
[1:42:14] You love
[1:42:18] all
[1:42:20] my
[1:42:27] You are all
[1:42:34] so much more
[1:42:37] than
[1:42:41] you are
[1:42:50] Amen. If you have a need,
[1:42:56] he's Jehovah.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; He knows the end from the beginning.
[1:43:03] He knows our desires.
[1:43:08] Maybe you have a need and you want to
[1:43:09] make it known with an uplifted hand. And
[1:43:10] you say, "God, I have a need in my life.
[1:43:17] Father,
[1:43:20] you are Jehovah Gyra.
[1:43:22] You are the same yesterday, today, and
[1:43:24] forever. And Lord, you never fail upon
[1:43:27] your word.
[1:43:30] Father, hands all over the building
[1:43:32] signifying they have a need. They have
[1:43:34] something in their life. But Lord, you
[1:43:37] can go to every single heart. You can
[1:43:40] walk the aisles. You can go to the very
[1:43:42] chair. You can discern the heart, Lord.
[1:43:45] You know the tears that are cried at
[1:43:47] night. You know the the wanderings or
[1:43:50] whatever it is, oh God, behind that
[1:43:52] uplifted hand. And I pray would you be
[1:43:55] their portion this evening, oh God.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're so personal to us.
[1:44:07] You're so real.
[1:44:10] that we can't ever thank you enough for
[1:44:12] your goodness in our lives, oh God. And
[1:44:16] we pray this evening,
[1:44:18] Father, that you would meet the needs
[1:44:20] that this word has gone forth and your
[1:44:22] people have come. We ask that you would
[1:44:24] encourage and that you would uplift,
[1:44:26] that you would be their portion, that
[1:44:28] they go from this place and they said,
[1:44:29] "It was good that I I came and I
[1:44:32] received of the Lord, that I heard from
[1:44:33] you, that I know who my God is. I know
[1:44:36] the God that I serve.
[1:44:41] The same God that done all these mighty
[1:44:44] works in the days of old that he he
[1:44:47] performed the wonders and Elijah called
[1:44:51] down fire from heaven.
[1:44:53] And he says, "If Baal be God, you serve
[1:44:55] him. But if OUR GOD ANSWERS BY FIRE, LET
[1:44:59] HIM be God."
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you're there to meet every
[1:45:04] challenge.
[1:45:07] And I say this evening, let our God be
[1:45:09] God,
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; for he answers by fire.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; And you prove your word time and time
[1:45:16] again.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Be with your people this evening. Go
[1:45:21] with them. Strengthen them. Strengthen
[1:45:23] our pastor, oh God. The needs of your
[1:45:25] body. You see, the ones that have
[1:45:26] cancer, the ones that have a a a need a
[1:45:29] heart surgery, all these ones, my wife
[1:45:31] at home, Lord, recovering. I ask a
[1:45:33] special blessing that you would go. my
[1:45:35] mother, oh God, that's been battling
[1:45:37] with these shingles. Oh God, Satan,
[1:45:39] you've held her long enough, oh God,
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; we claim a victory over it,
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; be your portion.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; go with us. We love you and thank you
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:58] Go ahead.
[1:46:00] Jehovah,
[1:46:08] you're my victory.
[1:46:15] You are
[1:46:22] for me.
[1:46:29] I see
[1:46:31] you. You are my righteousness.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:46:41] thank you, Lord.
[1:46:46] right now.
[1:46:49] Change me.
[1:46:55] You over

[1:47:09] You should know.
[1:47:14] You
[1:47:15] are my king.

[1:47:57] in all my life
[1:48:00] is knowing
[1:48:03] you. Has that been the greatest thing?
[1:48:06] Oh, the greatest thing
[1:48:10] in all my life,

[1:52:42] I'm melting your feet. It's
[1:52:46] overwhelming.
[1:52:52] Amen.
[1:52:54] Paul may close the service in a word of
[1:52:56] prayer.
[1:52:59] Thankful for the word we heard tonight.
[1:53:02] Pray be for the James restore strength.
[1:53:05] Bring virtue back
[1:53:07] for the
[1:53:19] dear heavenly father. It's just a
[1:53:23] blessing and a privilege dear Lord to
[1:53:25] come hear your word.
[1:53:29] Dear Lord, I want to know you as I am
[1:53:31] known of you, dear heavenly father.
[1:53:33] That's my desire,
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; to
[1:53:41] serve you, dearord, with all of my
[1:53:42] heart, dear Lord, to be yielded to you,
[1:53:44] too. There is nothing more important in
[1:53:47] this life, dear Lord, than living for
[1:53:49] you.
[1:53:52] Dear Lord, we are written epistles read
[1:53:54] and learned of all men by the lives we
[1:53:56] live, the way that we walk, and may it
[1:53:58] be to glorify you, dear heavenly father.
[1:54:01] Dear Lord, I'm just so thankful to come
[1:54:03] here and to hear your word. I pray that
[1:54:04] you would just restore strength to
[1:54:07] brother James, dear Lord. Be with him.
[1:54:09] Be with his family, dear heavenly
[1:54:11] father. Be with all those that are sick
[1:54:13] and needful, dear Lord, out there. Dear
[1:54:15] Lord, I just thank you for the
[1:54:18] opportunity to come here, dear Lord, to
[1:54:21] hear your word, to cast away all the
[1:54:23] busyiness of life, dear heavenly father,
[1:54:25] and the trials, dear Lord. And just to
[1:54:27] say, dear Lord, here I am. Deal with me.
[1:54:29] Change me, dear Lord.
[1:54:31] Just pray that you would bless the
[1:54:32] people, dear Lord. Give them a safe trip
[1:54:34] home. Bless the rest of this week, dear
[1:54:35] Lord. May
[1:54:37] we seek you more each and every day,
[1:54:39] dear heavenly father. May we come here
[1:54:40] Sunday expecting, dear Lord, to hear
[1:54:42] from you. May we realize as we come here
[1:54:45] here into this church, dear Lord, we're
[1:54:46] not coming here to hear man, dear Lord.
[1:54:50] But dear heavenly father, we come here
[1:54:52] to hear from you. Dear Lord, that's what
[1:54:54] I believe. I don't come here to hear
[1:54:56] man, whether it's brother James or
[1:54:57] brother Ron or any other ministers, dear
[1:55:00] Lord. Take my eyes off the man, dear
