[10:39] announcement for us if you could just
[10:41] come up
[10:43] with the service here also you can have
[10:45] your seats
[10:46] [Music]
[10:49] sorry just a little trustee uh
[10:52] announcement let's see make sure
[10:54] everybody's listening first everyone
[10:56] raise their hand raise your right hand
[10:58] we're not going to take an oath
[11:01] raise your hand raise your hand keep it
[11:03] up
[11:04] now everyone that doesn't have a key to
[11:06] the church put your hand down
[11:10] I'm trying to think how many keys I gave
[11:12] out
[11:13] we sure we sure okay
[11:17] um anyways the um
[11:19] if you have a key to the church knowing
[11:22] the procedure of how to do the alarm and
[11:25] everything is important everybody should
[11:27] know there's a certain entry exit doors
[11:29] you can't come in a side door the alarm
[11:31] goes off immediately you have to come in
[11:33] the front doors of that or the front
[11:34] doors of that building
[11:36] um also if you hear the sirens
[11:40] the alarm has gone off they'll call the
[11:42] police
[11:43] except
[11:45] I get notified and I negate 90 percent
[11:49] of the alarms
[11:52] uh I have a video I can see who does it
[11:54] but I don't ever say any names but uh
[11:56] the most important thing is that we have
[11:58] these things now that we all carry
[12:00] called smartphones
[12:01] if you don't know the procedure or if I
[12:05] recommend put elf Church like it's a
[12:08] person
[12:09] in your phone and put the password in
[12:11] there as we all get older if you haven't
[12:14] done the password for a while
[12:19] what was it
[12:21] um and we won't see any names of who's
[12:23] forgot to some of us that get over 50
[12:25] but please if you need anything text me
[12:28] and I'll I'll send you the contact of
[12:31] what I have in my phone because it if
[12:33] there was an issue sometimes having the
[12:35] address of the church is even good but
[12:37] there's a lot of us here
[12:39] I gave out more keys than I remember but
[12:43] um just the alarm the thing I worry is
[12:46] if we get too many alarms and the police
[12:47] do come I'm
[12:49] don't get a call they won't take us
[12:51] serious if I'm going to try to call the
[12:54] alarm company and say negate any alarm
[12:57] between
[12:58] nine and
[13:00] one on Sunday or something we're going
[13:02] to come up with something but God bless
[13:04] you Saints
[13:06] if you open you unlock the church you're
[13:09] the guy yeah oh that's right you know my
[13:12] feeling is if you open the community
[13:14] center
[13:15] you're the one responsible to lock it
[13:17] and arm it if you if you can't arm it I
[13:20] can arm it from my phone if I'm in Texas
[13:22] but the thing is just communicate but if
[13:25] if you open it
[13:27] I mean on Sunday morning obviously
[13:29] everybody's coming in somebody else will
[13:30] lock it but just if you don't know
[13:33] procedure or you haven't put it in your
[13:35] phone
[13:35] the information please do that thanks
[13:40] bless you
[13:41] made me glad forever

[48:49] that came alive
[48:54] and ever since that Lord we've set out

[51:04] so you know we we automatically have a
[51:08] time limit at home because we have an
[51:10] evening service
[51:12] but I you don't do nothing on Sunday so
[51:17] you might as well just sit around and
[51:20] rejoice in God's word amen would you
[51:23] turn with me to the Book of Joel
[51:27] The Book of Joel and
[51:30] and um
[51:32] it it's wonderful
[51:35] uh to be here like you said if you've
[51:38] known Ron a long time and I know Bill
[51:40] and Marshy is here my nephews here and
[51:43] and different ones so we're grateful for
[51:47] that I'm grateful to have three sons
[51:49] that serve the Lord a brother that
[51:51] preaches the gospel
[51:54] that's a real blessing to me
[51:57] and so I appreciate all them and all
[52:00] that they're doing for the kingdom and
[52:04] it says here we'll start with the second
[52:07] verse
[52:09] here it says hear this
[52:12] Ye Old Men
[52:14] and give ear
[52:16] all the inhabitation of the land
[52:20] half this been your days or even in the
[52:25] days of your fathers
[52:27] tell your children of it and let your
[52:31] children tell their children and their
[52:35] children another generation
[52:39] for that which the Palmer worm hath left
[52:42] hath the Locust eaten
[52:45] and that which the locth hath left half
[52:50] the canker worm eaten and that which the
[52:54] canker worm have left
[52:57] hath the caterpillar eaten our heavenly
[53:02] father asks that you bless us this
[53:04] morning
[53:05] in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you
[53:09] may be seated
[53:15] uh we're going to be speaking a little
[53:18] bit this morning I kind of as a pastor
[53:22] I'm not really much of an evangelist
[53:25] and
[53:27] I'm certainly
[53:29] not as energetic as I used to be
[53:33] but you find out that
[53:37] um
[53:38] there's ways that you can do things a
[53:41] lot simpler
[53:42] and so I have become a simpleton
[53:46] and and uh but I I hope that God is
[53:50] hidden Simplicity this morning I'm not a
[53:53] man of elegant words uh but I I do uh
[53:59] have a great desire for those that are
[54:05] lost
[54:06] and those that are suffering
[54:11] and it's I I can't change
[54:15] what I am
[54:17] uh uh it's the way that God made me I I
[54:22] know that I've been forgiven much
[54:25] and the scripture says that he who hath
[54:28] been forgiven much loves much
[54:31] and the greatest part of my life that
[54:35] I've found is I've known the depth
[54:39] of Sin from which God brought me
[54:42] and people have heard my testimony and
[54:47] and
[54:47] my testimony describes myself as a saint
[54:53] compared to the darkness that I was
[54:56] really in
[54:57] and to think that he could reach to that
[55:00] depth of Darkness
[55:04] and find something that he had placed in
[55:08] me before the foundation of the world
[55:11] and bring it to life
[55:14] and we never want to get away from them
[55:19] now I'm sure that you're here this
[55:22] morning because you believe that God
[55:26] sent a pillar of fire in this generation
[55:30] that he raised up a man born of God and
[55:35] and
[55:36] predestined by God and gifted to be a
[55:41] Divine interpreter of the word of God
[55:44] we're here this morning because we've
[55:47] heard the shout of our day and we know
[55:52] that we have an absolute in the message
[55:56] at and if we can't stray from it I'd
[55:59] like to read the way that he spoke it
[56:03] in the Sumerian Church she said
[56:06] only one messenger for each age receives
[56:11] what the Holy Spirit has to say to that
[56:16] age
[56:20] oh preachers hate that
[56:24] I kind of wanted to give some what I had
[56:29] but I have nothing
[56:33] and that one messenger is the messenger
[56:38] to the true church
[56:41] he speaks for God
[56:44] by Revelation to the churches both true
[56:49] and false
[56:51] the message is then broadcast to all
[56:56] but throughout its broadcast
[56:59] for all who come within range of the
[57:02] message
[57:04] the message is received individually by
[57:08] only a sweat certain qualified group in
[57:14] a certain way
[57:19] amen
[57:21] number yourself amongst them
[57:23] this morning I'm one of them
[57:27] I'm one of them who have received that
[57:30] word in a certain way from The Voice
[57:33] which he brought it
[57:37] each individual of that group is one who
[57:41] has the ability to hear what the spirit
[57:46] is saying by way of the messenger
[57:55] boy this is your description
[57:58] you can hear what the messenger says
[58:01] because you're a qualified group of
[58:03] people
[58:03] you were pre-qualified before the
[58:07] foundations of the world
[58:09] you were
[58:10] you were given this uh you you you came
[58:15] in range of the voice and it it spoke to
[58:19] you and you can see hear what the spirit
[58:22] is is saying by way of The Messengers
[58:26] those who here are qual are not getting
[58:30] their own private revelation
[58:33] nor is it a
[58:36] is a group getting their Collective
[58:39] revelation
[58:41] but each person is hearing and receiving
[58:45] what the messenger has already
[58:48] received from God
[58:51] amen
[58:54] now
[58:55] I didn't read that for you
[58:57] I read that for me
[59:00] because I know if I say what he said
[59:04] there's a qualified group of people here
[59:07] this morning
[59:08] that will hear it
[59:11] I'd like to visit with you this morning
[59:13] like I said I'm I'm not an evangelist I
[59:17] Pastor a church in Dallas Fort Worth and
[59:19] and um
[59:21] and
[59:23] um
[59:24] I've been there for a little while now
[59:28] but um
[59:30] I just have a way of doing things after
[59:32] so many years you know and it's just
[59:34] hard to teach an old dog new tricks
[59:38] I I see a lot of
[59:42] preachers come along and they've got a
[59:44] certain style and I think man I wish I
[59:47] could do that and
[59:49] and every time I try it I fail
[59:53] so I'm just gonna do things the way that
[59:55] I do it and trusting in Him but I'd like
[59:59] to speak to you this morning
[1:00:02] out of the message the Palmer worm a
[1:00:06] cankerworm caterpillar
[1:00:08] and Locus
[1:00:10] and because I I feel on my heart it's
[1:00:12] extremely needful
[1:00:15] and this morning if you have a need I
[1:00:18] don't know whether it's sickness or
[1:00:20] Finance or whatever your need is
[1:00:27] um he already knows it
[1:00:29] and his desire through the preaching of
[1:00:32] the word of God is to unclog and break
[1:00:37] down everything that would keep you from
[1:00:39] getting to your Source your fountain
[1:00:43] because I believe there's a fountain of
[1:00:45] Living Water that Springs up within the
[1:00:48] Church of the Living God and that he's
[1:00:51] still the same and he said he can do
[1:00:54] exceedingly and abundantly above what we
[1:00:57] could ask her thing if we could just
[1:00:59] find our path to him now I don't know if
[1:01:03] you are capable here but I could give
[1:01:06] you the paragraphs that I'm going to be
[1:01:08] reading from and if they could post
[1:01:11] those and you could read along with me
[1:01:14] because that would be that would be
[1:01:17] wonderful and uh and so we would like to
[1:01:23] do that he said now one of the things
[1:01:26] that the prophet brings to us
[1:01:29] and and this was in paragraph 36 of this
[1:01:32] book
[1:01:33] and it's the way that God works
[1:01:37] and he says this now remember the only
[1:01:39] thing can work
[1:01:41] as you work it in the law of that thing
[1:01:47] so if something can only work in the law
[1:01:51] according to the law that it was created
[1:01:55] to work in
[1:01:57] so if you if you have a certain thing
[1:02:00] and it's made a certain way the only way
[1:02:03] it'll work is if it works within that
[1:02:05] law and that applies to us as Believers
[1:02:10] we can only do things according to God's
[1:02:14] way of doing it
[1:02:15] at man's always tried to come up with a
[1:02:19] different way of doing things and and
[1:02:21] that's why we have Creeds and dogmas and
[1:02:24] we've got so many different things but
[1:02:27] God's never changed the command's always
[1:02:30] been changing God's ways always trying
[1:02:33] to find a different way for God to do
[1:02:36] things or kind of presuming what God
[1:02:39] meant
[1:02:40] so I think this is what God meant and so
[1:02:43] I'll try it this way or or I'll try it
[1:02:46] that way but there's absolutely a law
[1:02:49] that every single one of us is under and
[1:02:52] that's the law that God had pre-planned
[1:02:55] for us and we can't escape that law God
[1:02:59] had a way for you to hear and he chose
[1:03:03] that way to be preaching by the
[1:03:04] foolishness of preaching uh P he did it
[1:03:08] oh can you put it on that screen too
[1:03:11] then I know it's there
[1:03:14] unless you'd like me to preach like this
[1:03:23] but that
[1:03:25] that's the way that he chose it
[1:03:29] he chose the word of God to come and to
[1:03:33] prick your heart
[1:03:35] and God doesn't work from the outside he
[1:03:38] works from the inside out
[1:03:40] so if he wants to you know if you want
[1:03:43] to a seed to grow or a tree to grow the
[1:03:46] scripture says that what a husband Tree
[1:03:49] does is he digs it up and he gets down
[1:03:52] to the roots and he he puts what it
[1:03:54] needs in The Roots the the source and so
[1:03:58] your root is your heart
[1:04:01] The Roots is where it had came from the
[1:04:04] seed and and so what you're growing from
[1:04:09] and what you're what you're growing into
[1:04:12] is because there's a seed down in your
[1:04:15] heart
[1:04:16] and that's what God wants to start
[1:04:19] that's where he starts so he you a lot
[1:04:22] of us think he works from our head well
[1:04:25] our our the head's great
[1:04:28] you you know what I mean but there's a
[1:04:31] battler in that head
[1:04:33] every time that you that something goes
[1:04:37] through your mind you have the enemy
[1:04:40] there and he battles it and he fights it
[1:04:42] and he works on it and he destroys it
[1:04:44] and he distorts it in everything but you
[1:04:47] know God can bypass your head and he can
[1:04:51] go straight to your heart
[1:04:54] and then he can bring that word straight
[1:04:57] to your heart and you don't even know
[1:05:00] what's going on but there's something
[1:05:02] inside of you and that causes you to cry
[1:05:06] out
[1:05:09] when God converted me and I saw all the
[1:05:12] the darkness that I was in and all of a
[1:05:15] sudden my eyes opened up and I really
[1:05:18] saw what path I was on I didn't ask God
[1:05:21] to open my eyes I didn't say oh God open
[1:05:24] my eyes no he opened my eyes and
[1:05:27] basically he said you're in hell
[1:05:30] [Applause]
[1:05:34] and and I just I I couldn't do anything
[1:05:36] I just stopped there and I said God help
[1:05:38] me God help me I don't know what I am
[1:05:42] but I'm not this
[1:05:45] now that bypassed my mind and went
[1:05:48] straight to what was inside of me
[1:05:51] predestinated from the foundation of the
[1:05:54] world
[1:05:57] it's the trouble with civilization
[1:05:59] that's why civilization education and
[1:06:03] Sciences of the devil because it's a
[1:06:06] mind clutter
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:11] Satan's designed it to discredit the
[1:06:13] word of God to keep it from coming past
[1:06:17] all the things that are in that in your
[1:06:21] mind to keep that word from getting
[1:06:23] straight to your heart and what do we
[1:06:26] call that we call that reasoning
[1:06:28] [Applause]
[1:06:33] it's just like you know people want to
[1:06:36] say well what's up this guy's sleeve or
[1:06:38] or where is he going I I've got to get a
[1:06:41] grip on this you can't get a grip on me
[1:06:43] this morning because I don't know where
[1:06:45] I'm going
[1:06:56] someone said you're going to ruin your
[1:06:58] ministry I said fine I never wanted to
[1:07:00] be a preacher in the first place
[1:07:07] so something's got to work according to
[1:07:11] God's law
[1:07:12] and God chose the word of God
[1:07:17] he chose the preaching of the Gospel
[1:07:20] he chose not to give you something that
[1:07:23] you could understand
[1:07:25] but to give you something that you can
[1:07:27] believe
[1:07:30] God never said do you understand it have
[1:07:32] you figured it out all he wants is
[1:07:35] what's inside of you to say I believe
[1:07:39] I don't know why I believe it
[1:07:43] it didn't come from here it didn't come
[1:07:46] from reasoning it was a deep in here
[1:07:49] calling to a d it was a response that
[1:07:52] was in me that I didn't even know I have
[1:08:00] and that's the way God works
[1:08:03] That's the Law this morning
[1:08:06] that is is taking place right here
[1:08:10] not because of where we are or what
[1:08:14] group we are or what we sit under
[1:08:16] because he's not talking about he's
[1:08:19] talking about a particular group of
[1:08:21] people that's elected and chosen before
[1:08:26] the foundation of the world to hear the
[1:08:29] word and the voice of that messenger
[1:08:36] and so that's that's the the truth of
[1:08:40] the matter is we understand that and he
[1:08:43] said so uh
[1:08:47] that there's there's only one thing then
[1:08:50] it's everything has got to work
[1:08:53] according to the laws of God and he says
[1:08:57] in paragraph 40 he says that's the way
[1:08:59] it is with the kingdom of God we've got
[1:09:03] to find out what's wrong
[1:09:05] then work from that
[1:09:08] the scriptures is like a doctor's
[1:09:12] prescription
[1:09:19] so that's what he said
[1:09:21] so as we build I just wanted to lay a
[1:09:25] few little
[1:09:26] thoughts uh here that he brought out
[1:09:32] he says therefore in this is paragraph
[1:09:35] 42 therefore if there's something wrong
[1:09:37] in the church today
[1:09:40] that it's not
[1:09:43] progressing the way it should
[1:09:47] it's to my opinion that we ought to go
[1:09:51] back to the prescription
[1:09:57] now I'm not here to criticize
[1:10:02] and I'm not here to say as a judge
[1:10:07] but I would think after all this time
[1:10:10] that we would have progressed farther
[1:10:13] than we have
[1:10:16] in fact more carnality is coming into
[1:10:20] the church
[1:10:22] and more doubt
[1:10:25] and and
[1:10:26] more doubt in one another
[1:10:30] and the ground is shaky and it's
[1:10:36] uncertainty and it isn't I would say
[1:10:40] it's because of us but it's because of
[1:10:43] the atmosphere of confusion that we find
[1:10:47] ourselves in
[1:10:49] and that's the purpose is to for the
[1:10:53] enemy wants to shake the very Foundation
[1:10:57] by which you were converted if he can
[1:11:00] get you to doubt your conversion
[1:11:03] or he can get you to doubt your pardon
[1:11:07] if he can get you to doubt your
[1:11:09] experience then he can get that little
[1:11:12] seed of Doubt beginning to work in your
[1:11:15] heart he'll take years and years and
[1:11:19] years to work on it
[1:11:24] and there's only one prescription
[1:11:27] for that sickness
[1:11:30] and that's the word of God
[1:11:33] that's the scriptures
[1:11:35] that's the prescription our prescription
[1:11:39] in our date is the revealed scriptures
[1:11:42] for our day
[1:11:46] the message that the believer hears is
[1:11:50] the prescription for for the burden
[1:11:54] that's on your heart and in your mind
[1:11:59] the trouble that you're facing the
[1:12:01] confusion that you're up against the
[1:12:04] sickness that you're dealing with God
[1:12:07] knew it long before it ever got here so
[1:12:11] he gave the church the one thing that
[1:12:13] would take it all the way through and
[1:12:15] that was the word of God
[1:12:17] [Music]
[1:12:20] okay and so that we've got to stay with
[1:12:23] the prescription
[1:12:25] he says
[1:12:27] he says something I said we got to go
[1:12:29] back to the prescription find out just
[1:12:32] exactly what's wrong
[1:12:35] that is the church is so sick
[1:12:39] that there is disease in our church sin
[1:12:43] disease we've got to find what the
[1:12:47] doctor prescribed and see if our
[1:12:51] druggist pastors are giving us the right
[1:12:54] prescription
[1:13:00] I'm a pastor
[1:13:02] Ron's a pastor I sure he invades
[1:13:06] you
[1:13:08] to take whatever he's preaching and run
[1:13:12] it through the prescription
[1:13:18] that's what you want to be built on
[1:13:21] you don't want to be built on testimony
[1:13:23] you don't want to be built on on
[1:13:26] reputation
[1:13:28] and let's face it
[1:13:31] God never fed his church with
[1:13:33] yesterday's manna
[1:13:38] [Applause]
[1:13:39] he never filled his church with stories
[1:13:46] I've given my testimony but I don't come
[1:13:49] every place they go and tell the story
[1:13:51] tell the story tell the story churches
[1:13:54] become story time
[1:13:56] and it's not story time it's challenging
[1:14:00] time it's time to judge ourselves it's
[1:14:03] time to see if we're taking the
[1:14:04] prescription and if this prescription's
[1:14:07] having an effect
[1:14:08] if the prescription is not having effect
[1:14:11] because it's mixed with something else
[1:14:13] you ever read abolishes don't take this
[1:14:16] with this don't take this with this
[1:14:18] don't take this with this you don't want
[1:14:21] to sudden and if we got too many side
[1:14:23] effects
[1:14:27] church this is rapturing time
[1:14:31] this isn't time to do to do anything but
[1:14:34] make sure that we're on the direct
[1:14:36] course to the promise of God and that
[1:14:39] we've laid hold of what God wants us to
[1:14:42] lay hold of and that that we have what
[1:14:45] he's given us to be successful
[1:14:49] man
[1:14:52] the word of God says we're fools
[1:14:55] when we compare ourselves one with
[1:14:57] another
[1:15:00] if I compared my church to this church
[1:15:02] I'd be a fool
[1:15:07] every Church ought to preach three kinds
[1:15:10] of Believers the guy said How's your
[1:15:12] church I don't know I said I just got
[1:15:13] more make-believers than unbelievers
[1:15:15] than I ever had
[1:15:20] the Believers predestinated
[1:15:24] that number is never going to change
[1:15:27] you got to do is you got to make sure
[1:15:30] you've identified yourself in the word
[1:15:33] of God and you know you're born again
[1:15:47] there's just not
[1:15:48] I'll skip these paragraphs
[1:15:51] but there's not the sincerity
[1:15:55] that there used to be
[1:15:58] now you've got a gymnasium back here I
[1:16:00] think it's great but I hope you never
[1:16:02] play basketball
[1:16:04] on Sunday
[1:16:08] when you could be in here here in the
[1:16:11] word of God
[1:16:12] but all across our country now that's
[1:16:15] what's going on
[1:16:17] I'm okay with sports that's fine you got
[1:16:21] this bird team here in town you might
[1:16:24] like that bird team and then you've got
[1:16:27] some other guys that think there's some
[1:16:28] sort of diamonds you know I think
[1:16:30] they're coal but uh because that don't
[1:16:35] matter but don't give them
[1:16:39] time that you're not giving equal time
[1:16:42] to sharing the gospel
[1:16:48] that you're not giving equal time to
[1:16:51] spreading the word of God to going
[1:16:54] somewhere to passing out tracks making a
[1:16:57] phone call send it out emails you know
[1:17:00] wouldn't it be wonderful if all the
[1:17:02] internet lit up all of a sudden I don't
[1:17:05] know all these things face tube and and
[1:17:07] uh you know we used to call it all a
[1:17:10] boob tube you know what I mean but
[1:17:11] because that's what I've met with the
[1:17:13] word of God out there God sent a message
[1:17:16] hear the message of God going to say we
[1:17:18] got in church down there that prays for
[1:17:20] the stick bring your people if
[1:17:23] you're lost if you're seeking a problem
[1:17:25] come on in
[1:17:27] Hallelujah
[1:17:33] give the gospel equal time
[1:17:39] I told the old people I said it's not
[1:17:41] too late to work for the kingdom
[1:17:45] I told the young people I'm glad to be
[1:17:47] here with you because you're more like
[1:17:48] me than the other group
[1:17:57] it took
[1:18:00] let me just say it this way because I I
[1:18:02] don't want to go negative in any form at
[1:18:04] all but don't you think God's got more
[1:18:06] for us
[1:18:08] more power more life more victory
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:14] he's can put within us the ability to
[1:18:18] take Satan and possess his Gates drive
[1:18:21] them out of our life claim our children
[1:18:24] claim our loved ones see the
[1:18:27] resurrection move in our midst because
[1:18:29] we are going to work according to his
[1:18:33] law
[1:18:43] we want to be sincere
[1:18:46] so he talked about these insects
[1:18:50] this is paragraph 47.
[1:18:53] we'll read here as we just
[1:18:56] we're moving to a point we're not going
[1:18:59] to go through the whole book we're going
[1:19:00] to go to one point this morning
[1:19:05] you say why are you putting it there
[1:19:08] because the true bride
[1:19:11] hears from the messenger
[1:19:16] I think it's a shame
[1:19:19] in this country today all the message
[1:19:22] churches we have
[1:19:25] where the very source of life
[1:19:29] is the voice of God
[1:19:31] everything we teach from this Pulpit is
[1:19:34] supposed to come from that messenger
[1:19:36] because he's the only source he is the
[1:19:40] voice of God to the church and yet our
[1:19:43] churches are playing less tapes and less
[1:19:46] tapes and less tapes
[1:19:49] you hardly have a congregation anymore
[1:19:51] that'll sit under the voice of the
[1:19:54] messenger and have that voice go out to
[1:19:57] each of those members of that bride and
[1:20:01] speak to him you want to be come to in
[1:20:04] unity
[1:20:06] come under what that God's brought you
[1:20:08] here under
[1:20:10] and that's that voice of that messenger
[1:20:13] angel
[1:20:15] I'm not tape only that's someone says oh
[1:20:17] I preached the sermon one day and he
[1:20:19] said oh I see your tape only
[1:20:22] really
[1:20:25] then another guy come up and said I see
[1:20:27] you don't believe in Preachers
[1:20:29] I said well you guys are calling me a
[1:20:31] hypocrite
[1:20:34] no I believe in it
[1:20:39] but I believe it's a resource that God's
[1:20:41] given if you had a sick child
[1:20:44] wouldn't you use every resource to make
[1:20:47] that child well
[1:20:48] [Applause]
[1:20:49] you take her to specialist you take her
[1:20:52] to the doctors you'd bring this one in
[1:20:54] you'd bring that one in you use every
[1:20:56] medicine in fact if somebody told you
[1:20:58] and said you know what I I ate some seed
[1:21:01] weed from from the the Great Coral Reef
[1:21:05] off the coast of New Zealand and it's a
[1:21:08] green purple uh seaweed and if you eat
[1:21:11] this it'll make you better I'll
[1:21:13] guarantee you you'd be down in New
[1:21:15] Zealand diving for seaweed
[1:21:22] the tapes are a resource
[1:21:26] they're not the only resource if I'd say
[1:21:29] that singing's a resource preaching's a
[1:21:32] resource but it's one of the resources
[1:21:34] that God's given the church that the
[1:21:37] bride can hear together and God can
[1:21:39] speak to every single one of us at the
[1:21:41] same time under that voice
[1:21:50] it's what we live by
[1:21:53] you can't live by my sermon you can't
[1:21:56] live by my voice you can't live by
[1:21:58] Brother Ronson you can only live by what
[1:22:01] he says that the messenger said
[1:22:05] That's the Law of God for the believer
[1:22:09] in our day and it must be done according
[1:22:13] to God's law
[1:22:17] back to the word
[1:22:20] the source
[1:22:27] he said
[1:22:29] now these insects if you'll get your
[1:22:32] book on insects you'll notice that
[1:22:35] there's four different insects it's the
[1:22:38] self
[1:22:40] same insect four different stages of its
[1:22:43] life
[1:22:44] all of us know that
[1:22:46] a cocoon is nothing but a caterpillar
[1:22:49] covered over and it's going to hatch out
[1:22:51] into a butterfly and a butterfly is a
[1:22:53] caterpillar before it hatches out the
[1:22:56] palm of worm the locus also forth is the
[1:22:59] same thing same insect
[1:23:02] now now whatever
[1:23:04] now listen close
[1:23:12] whatever happened in the first place
[1:23:17] with the insect of the Palmer
[1:23:21] just before became a caterpillar later
[1:23:25] and the powder care became a locust
[1:23:27] later whatever it was that started in
[1:23:31] the beginning is still the same thing
[1:23:34] that's causing the trouble today
[1:23:40] let's go back now to the scriptures and
[1:23:44] find out what started now this prophet's
[1:23:47] calling him caterpillar canker worm but
[1:23:51] may I say it this way not for
[1:23:54] doctrinal's sake
[1:23:56] but to stir your minds up to where that
[1:24:01] we're talking in our day it's the same
[1:24:04] spirit
[1:24:06] right it's working the same way today
[1:24:09] but we've come to know by the opening of
[1:24:13] the seals that that is a white horse
[1:24:17] a red horse a black horse and a Pale
[1:24:21] Horse
[1:24:24] so we've got to go find out what trouble
[1:24:28] did those guys cause
[1:24:35] and we're not going to go through the
[1:24:36] seals this morning
[1:24:40] but it's the same thing that started
[1:24:45] the same thing
[1:24:47] so if if we we want to get well
[1:24:52] then we've got to find out what was it
[1:24:54] that this thing ate off the church
[1:25:00] what got away from us
[1:25:03] okay because if we're having trouble
[1:25:06] something slipped away
[1:25:12] and so that's what we want what what
[1:25:15] slipped away what am I missing
[1:25:20] I hate to do a puzzle where somebody's
[1:25:23] kept one piece out and put it in their
[1:25:26] pocket
[1:25:31] because you can't complete the picture
[1:25:36] and I want the picture completed God had
[1:25:40] a picture of me in his mind and I want
[1:25:43] him to complete that picture I want
[1:25:45] every piece of that puzzle to be in my
[1:25:47] life I want to be what he wants me to be
[1:25:50] and the word of God is here to take me
[1:25:53] from what I am to what he wants me to be
[1:26:02] now this is graph 49.
[1:26:07] now we know that we can only build a
[1:26:11] church first upon the materials that God
[1:26:15] has given us to build it with
[1:26:23] the churches went and tried to build
[1:26:26] itself with social
[1:26:28] with personality
[1:26:32] I like Joel Osteen they said how why are
[1:26:35] you successful he says why do people
[1:26:37] flock to you he said because I Don't
[1:26:40] Preach against sin
[1:26:46] I preach that everybody's an overcomer
[1:26:50] that God loves everybody
[1:26:54] and and there's nothing that keeps God
[1:26:57] from blessing you
[1:26:59] well I could have read farther in the
[1:27:02] scriptures and the next scriptures that
[1:27:04] he talks about and he says they've
[1:27:06] turned the word of God into a lie
[1:27:10] that's a lie
[1:27:13] you can't escape the requirements of God
[1:27:19] you can't change the formula
[1:27:23] the formula has always been repent
[1:27:31] it doesn't matter if they wrap your arms
[1:27:33] around you and say oh I'm so glad you're
[1:27:35] here
[1:27:38] right brother
[1:27:39] brother or or you know he didn't cut
[1:27:44] it's not a group revelation
[1:27:54] can only build upon what God gave us to
[1:27:57] build with
[1:27:58] that's all we have
[1:28:05] all you got
[1:28:07] you're stuck with it
[1:28:10] you are stuck
[1:28:13] with the sermons and the messages that
[1:28:16] the prophet has brought you to make you
[1:28:19] what he needs you to be to make the
[1:28:23] rapture
[1:28:25] we are stuck with what God the material
[1:28:29] that God gave us to build with
[1:28:34] no I don't care what some other great
[1:28:37] architect tries to come along with or
[1:28:39] some other thing or some idea I don't
[1:28:42] want to test no new ideas when it comes
[1:28:46] to my soul
[1:28:47] I don't want to cast no new
[1:28:49] interpretations no new explanations no
[1:28:53] can no no more putting stuff together
[1:28:56] and and drawing this from that and
[1:28:58] coming up with some stew
[1:29:01] because there's poison in that pot I
[1:29:04] want to stay with what he said
[1:29:06] [Applause]
[1:29:09] I want to hear it I want to read it and
[1:29:12] I want it revealed to me pray for
[1:29:15] Revelation more than anything else pray
[1:29:18] for Revelation and the Revelation can
[1:29:21] only come from the material that God
[1:29:24] gave you for that Revelation to come
[1:29:26] from
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:30] I don't care how enticing words they are
[1:29:32] I don't care how anointed they get if
[1:29:35] it's not from the original Source it's
[1:29:38] not real
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:47] I know this is strong
[1:29:50] and it's on tape
[1:29:52] and hundreds of people around the world
[1:29:55] will hear
[1:30:06] I don't have to ask the question
[1:30:08] do I
[1:30:15] 100 people around the world here but
[1:30:18] before we can ever have
[1:30:21] a building of the Church of God
[1:30:24] we will have to restore back all those
[1:30:27] things that these insects have eaten out
[1:30:31] of it
[1:30:33] we'll have to go back and find out what
[1:30:37] those insects eat
[1:30:39] before
[1:30:41] this Vine of the Lord
[1:30:45] the Grapevine
[1:30:47] he's the vine we are the branches
[1:30:50] and before we can ever find out or the
[1:30:54] church can stand in its formal and
[1:30:58] original Power
[1:31:00] it will have to go back and find out
[1:31:03] what the insects eat
[1:31:06] and that church will have to be restored
[1:31:09] back to that
[1:31:11] or it will never stand in its power and
[1:31:16] Glory of its first standing and
[1:31:20] how many knows what Malachi 4 was to do
[1:31:28] it was to restore back the Faith of Our
[1:31:32] Fathers
[1:31:33] [Applause]
[1:31:34] that the works that I do you can do also
[1:31:38] man has been trying to produce those
[1:31:41] works with his own formula
[1:31:46] he's been trying to describe what it
[1:31:48] means to be born again let the holy
[1:31:51] spirit is we've wasted so many words on
[1:31:55] things that's in God's hands and God's
[1:31:58] hands alone
[1:31:59] when he bursts you you know it
[1:32:02] [Applause]
[1:32:07] you don't know any need to tell you
[1:32:10] you don't need me to try to create a
[1:32:13] definition of the holy spirit that you
[1:32:16] can put in your mind and wrap your mind
[1:32:18] around God works in mysterious ways when
[1:32:22] he comes to your heart when he bursts
[1:32:25] that seed he can do it where he wants
[1:32:27] when he wants and how he wants but if
[1:32:30] you're predestinated that birth is yours
[1:32:38] and you can't make it happen
[1:32:43] the best you can do
[1:32:45] is know there's a spot in your heart
[1:32:48] that you need filled
[1:32:51] and be honest with yourself
[1:32:56] I've been 50 years in this message
[1:32:58] everybody thinks this of me everybody
[1:33:00] thinks that of me I've got this
[1:33:03] reputation I can't let it let me tell
[1:33:06] you if you're not born again you need to
[1:33:08] get burned again else you're lost
[1:33:17] can't hide behind anything
[1:33:21] this is manifesting time this is proof
[1:33:24] in the pudding
[1:33:26] this is what's flowing from the mouth
[1:33:28] the elect says nothing until it's not
[1:33:31] saith the Lord and thus saith the Lord
[1:33:34] comes in the word of God the mouth of
[1:33:37] God the voice of God that God sent in
[1:33:41] this hour to the bride
[1:33:45] sorry
[1:33:47] for getting excited
[1:33:51] but it's life or death for me
[1:33:54] and we got a cold lukewarm
[1:33:58] worldly entangled mentally poisoned
[1:34:02] Church
[1:34:09] how do you know brother McGarry because
[1:34:11] I have the same disease
[1:34:19] I gotta look in the mirror
[1:34:24] the scripture says in John he says here
[1:34:26] in the love of God is made perfect
[1:34:29] that as he is so are we in this world
[1:34:36] how's that for a test
[1:34:41] am I okay
[1:34:44] you want to send me if your crock pot or
[1:34:47] your instant pot's gonna burn your food
[1:34:49] please go
[1:34:51] I've just used my 20 minutes from the
[1:34:53] first service
[1:35:07] the deacons just said they're not going
[1:35:09] to let you out
[1:35:19] do we have to understand that there's a
[1:35:21] first standing of that church
[1:35:26] that there's an original Foundation
[1:35:30] he says in paragraph 51 in the scripture
[1:35:33] God's holy Bible is the lifeline to any
[1:35:38] church
[1:35:39] how could we ever bring up grapes app
[1:35:42] through Sycamore bark
[1:35:45] it won't work
[1:35:47] we've got to have grape Bart we've got
[1:35:51] to have the original bars there's only
[1:35:54] one way that the bark can ever come back
[1:35:59] on the vine is when God grows it himself
[1:36:10] I can't grow it this morning
[1:36:13] I'm limited
[1:36:15] all he said was go into all the world
[1:36:19] and preach the gospel
[1:36:22] it's all I can do
[1:36:24] the foolishness of preaching
[1:36:31] just go preach it
[1:36:33] whoever will hear it preach it
[1:36:36] now I'm not I'm not preaching to you
[1:36:39] this morning I am reading to you what he
[1:36:42] said
[1:36:44] the question is
[1:36:45] is it speaking to you
[1:36:51] I don't want to be afraid for God to
[1:36:53] speak to me
[1:36:55] remember the little woman that with the
[1:36:58] ointment
[1:36:59] and everything
[1:37:01] and she was going to go anoint Jesus's
[1:37:03] feet
[1:37:04] and she sat back there and the prophet
[1:37:06] of God said she said if I go down there
[1:37:09] and take this
[1:37:12] oil
[1:37:14] and anoint his feet he will know what I
[1:37:18] did to get the money to buy the oil
[1:37:28] but you know it prevailed
[1:37:31] he said he's the only one
[1:37:35] that can help me
[1:37:41] and there's I'm not I'm not ashamed that
[1:37:45] he knows
[1:37:46] I'm not ashamed I've got nothing to hide
[1:37:49] he's the only one that can help me
[1:38:04] God's got to do it himself
[1:38:07] you can put all kinds of stuff on it
[1:38:11] all kinds of programs all kinds of stuff
[1:38:13] all kinds of these things but until God
[1:38:16] grows it
[1:38:18] it don't work
[1:38:20] now we're talking about this eating
[1:38:23] you know and
[1:38:26] and
[1:38:28] you know a lot of times
[1:38:30] bugs work from the inside out I think we
[1:38:33] have tree people here maybe
[1:38:36] it works from the inside out and it's
[1:38:39] just what's happening to the church and
[1:38:41] what's happening to the believer
[1:38:43] everything looks good on the outside
[1:38:48] everything that's good we're dressed
[1:38:50] right or buildings are nice we've come
[1:38:53] from the Sheepfold and and and now it
[1:38:56] seems like we're moving into the palace
[1:38:58] and everything is is beautiful but on
[1:39:03] the inside we're being ate up
[1:39:10] he's eaten away in our heart
[1:39:13] he's eaten away at our experience
[1:39:15] we can smile we can look good on the
[1:39:18] outside everything's fine but down
[1:39:21] inside something's chewing away at us
[1:39:24] it's robbing us of the of the the
[1:39:26] fountainish it's just plugging up our
[1:39:30] spring
[1:39:34] our faith is weakening
[1:39:39] or courage
[1:39:43] has been placed in the shell
[1:39:51] we're concerned about our standing
[1:39:55] and what people think
[1:40:01] what's worse we're afraid of what one
[1:40:03] another thinks
[1:40:05] I will hope that I would be in a body of
[1:40:08] Believers that had such love one for
[1:40:10] another that if I came to the altar
[1:40:13] there wouldn't be a bunch of gossipers
[1:40:15] that want to know what is he down there
[1:40:17] for or or or all the many discerners oh
[1:40:21] he's down there because he did this and
[1:40:24] he done that and and oh I knew he never
[1:40:27] had faith
[1:40:29] I knew all along there was something
[1:40:32] wrong with him well if you know all the
[1:40:34] wrong that there was something wrong
[1:40:35] with him and you didn't do anything
[1:40:37] about it I got news for you you have to
[1:40:40] go back to the same place that he's at
[1:40:43] or you go to hell
[1:40:50] oh don't think you're immune from hell
[1:40:53] it may be hell on this Earth
[1:40:59] but you will reap the wages of sin
[1:41:04] and the tongue is an unruly member
[1:41:06] that's hard to be Bridal and I hear so
[1:41:10] much bitterness come out of the fountain
[1:41:12] that's supposed to be sweet that I hope
[1:41:15] God speaks to your heart this morning
[1:41:24] wouldn't it be terrible if we had to put
[1:41:26] out there on the same evening like
[1:41:28] gospel gossip Fellowship
[1:41:35] we'll talk about the Dead
[1:41:40] if we think it'll put a brownie
[1:41:43] point on us
[1:41:45] I don't need brownie points
[1:41:47] I need the blood
[1:41:50] God's got only one provided place that
[1:41:53] he meets the believer and that's under
[1:41:55] the shed blood and if you've ever been
[1:41:58] washed by that blood you'll never judge
[1:42:01] another person
[1:42:05] am I screaming
[1:42:07] would you pray the Lord calms me down
[1:42:11] because I want to go
[1:42:15] I want to get out of here
[1:42:19] and now all I need is one more real
[1:42:22] believer
[1:42:24] and then the bride's gone
[1:42:27] he said it only take can
[1:42:30] Joe Leslie's here but we only count as
[1:42:33] one
[1:42:36] somebody was there the other night
[1:42:44] would you put it in your heart
[1:42:47] to be one of the eight
[1:42:57] it eats away at us
[1:42:59] and all of a sudden we found out we're
[1:43:01] ate up
[1:43:02] we're ate up everything looks good
[1:43:06] brother you look good
[1:43:08] you know what I mean you look like
[1:43:09] you're about 18.
[1:43:12] do you know what I mean you're maybe 28
[1:43:15] I don't know
[1:43:16] you know if you look good you look you
[1:43:18] look great you all look like Believers
[1:43:20] you all got your hair nice and and
[1:43:24] you're dressed nice and
[1:43:26] you're part of a big thing you know the
[1:43:30] biggest thing in Phoenix the thing
[1:43:32] that's going on
[1:43:36] but the worms crawling through your life
[1:43:39] was crawling through your heart
[1:43:42] you're not positive the tokens apply
[1:43:45] you're not positive you've got the
[1:43:47] affair
[1:43:49] good that it's been paid for you you're
[1:43:51] not real sure whether you're born again
[1:43:53] you're not real sure whether that
[1:43:57] you're gonna make it
[1:44:00] you don't know if your name's on the
[1:44:02] Lamb's Book of Life or not
[1:44:08] I'd like to kill that bug
[1:44:17] that boar
[1:44:20] and you know how you'll kill the boar
[1:44:22] you inject the poison in the root
[1:44:29] I have a source for that information
[1:44:37] listen to what he says
[1:44:40] are you interested in what he said
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:45] he says
[1:44:51] he says no wonder this is paragraph 53
[1:44:53] no wonder we we can't have healing
[1:44:55] campaigns no wonder the churches are are
[1:44:58] tore up no wonder one will say oh this
[1:45:01] that and the other so disagree no wonder
[1:45:05] there's such isms Among Us it's because
[1:45:08] we can't bear the real fruit of patience
[1:45:12] long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:45:14] gentleness
[1:45:16] the lifeline has been cut off from the
[1:45:19] tree
[1:45:20] and will never bring it up through
[1:45:23] Creeds of some rag or some substitute
[1:45:27] bark it'll take the power of almighty
[1:45:31] God to grow that tree back to its
[1:45:35] condition again
[1:45:39] how many want to go back to the original
[1:45:42] condition
[1:45:47] you can claim all that you want
[1:45:50] but the evidence of the tree is the
[1:45:53] fruits
[1:45:56] and that's what he's keeping
[1:45:59] the church from producing is the fruit
[1:46:01] and I'm going to move quickly now
[1:46:08] he says in paragraph 55 I'm going to
[1:46:10] drive this down
[1:46:13] and I want you to listen
[1:46:19] let it be God's truth
[1:46:23] let's line up with what God Said
[1:46:26] regardless of what anybody else says
[1:46:30] I want to use four different things of
[1:46:34] what I see in the scriptures that these
[1:46:37] insects have eaten off the Church of the
[1:46:40] Living God and has got the vine of God
[1:46:44] crippled and stunted
[1:46:48] okay
[1:46:50] paragraph 67.
[1:46:52] now let's go back and I want to name
[1:46:55] four different just as the scriptures as
[1:46:58] I know how to be
[1:47:00] that these insects have eaten from the
[1:47:03] church
[1:47:04] from it first original
[1:47:07] condition
[1:47:12] that's what he took away from the church
[1:47:14] was the original condition
[1:47:21] my mother spend a lot of time on that
[1:47:23] because I want to really go someplace
[1:47:26] else this morning
[1:47:28] but that's what's happened is the
[1:47:31] original condition of the church
[1:47:34] Satan changed the condition and changed
[1:47:38] the requirements
[1:47:39] he says it's the original condition
[1:47:42] now the first thing the church has to
[1:47:45] establish
[1:47:47] he says the first thing the church was
[1:47:49] established on the day of Pentecost
[1:47:51] Peter preached an inauguratal sermon at
[1:47:55] The Bachelor attorney at service when
[1:47:58] the church was born
[1:48:00] Christian Church was born on the day of
[1:48:03] Pentecost
[1:48:04] and if God is infinite and cannot change
[1:48:08] his church must remain as it was at the
[1:48:13] beginning
[1:48:14] do you admit that
[1:48:17] amen so the the first thing that we've
[1:48:20] we realized that the the condition
[1:48:23] changed
[1:48:28] and that's the first thing that we we
[1:48:31] understand that James even said he says
[1:48:35] there's people that have come in amongst
[1:48:37] you there's wrinkles and spots in your
[1:48:39] feast in other words you're not keeping
[1:48:42] it holy no more the tokens gone out
[1:48:45] we've let we've let little things in
[1:48:49] you know and and and I'm not here to try
[1:48:52] to balance all those things because
[1:48:54] you've got a pastor for that
[1:48:56] you know but if you let your kids play a
[1:48:59] game or something or join a team you
[1:49:01] better talk to them real good
[1:49:06] if you're going to send your kid to
[1:49:07] public school you better talk to them
[1:49:10] real good
[1:49:12] you better tell your children
[1:49:15] and your children
[1:49:17] and the generations to come you ought to
[1:49:21] really make them aware
[1:49:24] you got to get them to understand not
[1:49:26] everybody's a Believer and they're not
[1:49:27] like everybody else they're going to
[1:49:30] want to be but something like somebody
[1:49:31] else but just think of those people
[1:49:34] those people were used to being
[1:49:36] Sanctified and set of tied at Pentecost
[1:49:42] they were circumcised Jews that went up
[1:49:45] there
[1:49:49] they were in condition
[1:49:51] for the spirit to come
[1:49:54] now we know we're Gentiles so there's
[1:49:57] one thing that gets us in the condition
[1:49:59] and that's the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:50:01] Christ and the word of God
[1:50:05] but we've got to apply the token to our
[1:50:08] lives
[1:50:09] we've got to separate from the world we
[1:50:12] can't walk with the world and serve God
[1:50:17] and I'm not going to give a list of what
[1:50:19] the world is
[1:50:21] because each of you should know what it
[1:50:24] is that hindered you from being what you
[1:50:27] should be and you've got to make that
[1:50:30] decision yourself
[1:50:33] if not we'll form a Creed and it'll be
[1:50:36] the Creed of evening gossip Tabernacle
[1:50:42] this is what we believe this is how we
[1:50:45] do it this is what we looked at things
[1:50:48] this is what we think about sports this
[1:50:50] is what we think about this this is our
[1:50:53] opinion on dating this is this you're
[1:50:56] not entitled
[1:50:58] to your opinion
[1:51:02] you have a messenger
[1:51:05] sent from God
[1:51:08] that the true bride hears
[1:51:11] that's your opinion
[1:51:13] and you need to hold one another to that
[1:51:17] opinion if you love one another hold
[1:51:20] them to that opinion in love hold your
[1:51:23] pastor to that opinion hold the church
[1:51:25] to that opinion hold the deacons to that
[1:51:28] opinion hold the trustees for the
[1:51:30] opinion and if they won't line up with
[1:51:32] the word of God pray for them
[1:51:41] because there's a Rapture coming
[1:51:45] and it's got to come quick
[1:51:48] because he said if he didn't shorten the
[1:51:50] days no flesh would be saved man are
[1:51:53] becoming women women are becoming man
[1:51:55] Satan has sat on the throne he's now
[1:51:58] saying I can God made a male and female
[1:52:01] he says that's not true I will make them
[1:52:07] I will give man the power to choose what
[1:52:10] they are
[1:52:16] if that don't scare the liver out of you
[1:52:23] when that lady stood up there in purple
[1:52:28] yeah
[1:52:30] I don't know how many prophesies were
[1:52:32] fulfilled men with masks and and all
[1:52:36] locked up and all the things the prophet
[1:52:39] of God that said but has it really
[1:52:40] affected us
[1:52:42] hasn't made us change our life has it
[1:52:45] made us re-evaluate where we're had what
[1:52:48] we're listening to what we're doing what
[1:52:50] we're fellowshipping with has it made
[1:52:52] one change in your life
[1:53:02] in order
[1:53:04] you say brother Mary Gary why are you a
[1:53:06] picture because I can't make it without
[1:53:07] you
[1:53:11] yeah
[1:53:13] I'm Abraham seed
[1:53:16] I gotta run after lot if he's not going
[1:53:18] to live right I gotta go down to the
[1:53:20] city
[1:53:26] I don't want to leave anybody behind
[1:53:33] I'm sure that's your heart's desire too
[1:53:39] now I'm going to start my sermon I've
[1:53:40] used up all the time
[1:53:43] and then some
[1:53:45] but you know this may be my last time
[1:53:47] ever to preach
[1:53:51] not maybe I'm just not saying here this
[1:53:53] may be the last time I ever preach I
[1:53:55] don't know
[1:53:58] but I want to be true
[1:54:05] do we got to make sure that we're back
[1:54:10] to the original condition
[1:54:16] we want to go back to the original
[1:54:18] condition
[1:54:20] now I wanted to spend now
[1:54:23] after all I said
[1:54:25] I want to preach you what's on my heart
[1:54:29] this morning
[1:54:30] will you allow me to do that
[1:54:36] we all know the statue of a perfect man
[1:54:40] and the First Foundation is what
[1:54:44] faith
[1:54:48] we know that
[1:54:50] faith
[1:54:51] has to rest upon something
[1:54:55] right
[1:54:57] Faith final resting place
[1:55:00] is the word
[1:55:03] but I want to bring a little more
[1:55:05] insight if I could not my insight the
[1:55:09] Insight that's written in this message
[1:55:13] to really what that is
[1:55:17] we've got a church
[1:55:19] that as a body looks fine
[1:55:22] it looks healthy
[1:55:25] but we've got hearts
[1:55:28] and spirits
[1:55:30] that are being eaten alive
[1:55:34] we've got people that are in secret are
[1:55:37] fighting things they can't overcome
[1:55:40] we've got mind battles that are pushing
[1:55:43] us from one side to the other
[1:55:46] we've got a roaring lion
[1:55:48] that's going about seeking whom he may
[1:55:51] devour
[1:55:52] we're fighting spiritual wickedness in
[1:55:55] high places there's been two hundred
[1:55:58] thousand demon demons loosed on the
[1:56:01] bride at the river Euphrates
[1:56:04] I don't even know if I said that right
[1:56:06] it might have been 200 000 000.
[1:56:15] so
[1:56:17] if
[1:56:19] we're trying to
[1:56:22] be drawn
[1:56:25] to rapturing condition
[1:56:29] and we know that there's been something
[1:56:31] that's been eating away at us
[1:56:36] and stealing from us
[1:56:39] what it is
[1:56:41] and it's our foundation
[1:56:44] and it's our condition
[1:56:47] and their long-range plans
[1:56:54] I had a man a friend of mine one time
[1:57:00] he he never
[1:57:03] could accept
[1:57:06] the promise of God
[1:57:09] he was afraid to accept his healing he
[1:57:12] was afraid to accept his Deliverance
[1:57:17] and I asked him one day I just talked to
[1:57:19] him my heart was bleeding for him
[1:57:22] the guy lived right he was a Believer he
[1:57:25] was a brother I knew the seed was in him
[1:57:29] but there was something in him that was
[1:57:31] just
[1:57:32] eating them up
[1:57:34] and I finally taught me he says brother
[1:57:36] what is it
[1:57:38] and the Lord just touched his heart and
[1:57:41] he began to say you know when I was a
[1:57:44] boy
[1:57:46] alls I ever wanted
[1:57:49] was one of those big fire trucks
[1:57:52] that you hook the hose to
[1:57:54] I had one I knew what he was talking
[1:57:56] about
[1:57:58] and it had little hoses and you could
[1:58:00] spray it and everything
[1:58:01] he says that's all I ever wanted
[1:58:06] and he said one day
[1:58:09] I forgot to take out the trash or I
[1:58:11] forgot to make my bed
[1:58:14] he said my dad took me back
[1:58:18] and he opened the trunk of his car
[1:58:23] and he pointed to that fire truck
[1:58:26] and he said you would have got this fire
[1:58:28] truck
[1:58:30] if you weren't such a little evil person
[1:58:34] and he shut the trunk
[1:58:39] just a young boy
[1:58:43] he was afraid to desire a gift
[1:58:48] because he was encompassed with the fear
[1:58:52] that it would be taken away from him
[1:58:57] fear and failure launches from the same
[1:59:01] spot
[1:59:06] it starts at the same place
[1:59:08] if you've got fear that if you make a
[1:59:12] step you won't be able to follow through
[1:59:14] or you're afraid you'll fall
[1:59:18] you you don't want you don't want it
[1:59:20] make the the the chance to step out on
[1:59:25] faith
[1:59:27] because
[1:59:29] you you don't know what the result is
[1:59:34] that faith
[1:59:37] is not built
[1:59:40] in the right thing
[1:59:43] all right
[1:59:45] faith is not something you can muster up
[1:59:52] it's not something you can create
[1:59:56] you are helpless
[2:00:02] you can say I believe I believe
[2:00:06] but Faith isn't the doctrine you believe
[2:00:11] faith is a gift of God
[2:00:14] lest any man should boast
[2:00:17] faith is something that God shows you
[2:00:21] and the church has to be built
[2:00:25] on the right faith
[2:00:30] now you might want to jump a little
[2:00:32] ahead and
[2:00:33] heard sermons on faith and
[2:00:36] go to your library of your mind and
[2:00:39] do all those things
[2:00:42] and that's okay
[2:00:44] but don't miss what I'm going to read to
[2:00:46] you
[2:00:50] because it's the answer
[2:00:54] I don't know if we're televised or we're
[2:00:57] streaming or whatever
[2:01:00] who watches and who don't particularly I
[2:01:04] don't care
[2:01:08] I'm only talking to you this morning
[2:01:12] I don't have a worldwide Ministry I
[2:01:14] don't want a worldwide Ministry
[2:01:17] I want to tell the people that can hear
[2:01:20] my voice
[2:01:22] about him
[2:01:32] paragraph 77.
[2:01:36] now one of the first things that I'd
[2:01:39] like to speak to you for a few minutes
[2:01:43] after we have found out that the
[2:01:46] foundation must be original
[2:01:50] it must go back
[2:01:53] to the foundation
[2:01:56] it must go back to where
[2:01:59] it was a vine
[2:02:05] right
[2:02:06] he is a vine
[2:02:09] ye are the branches
[2:02:12] we've heard so many teaching on that
[2:02:17] the vine is not operating right
[2:02:21] let's go find out what's wrong
[2:02:24] now one of the first things that I'd
[2:02:27] like to mention
[2:02:28] is that something has gone from our
[2:02:33] church
[2:02:34] and one of the main things is faith
[2:02:40] now
[2:02:42] we say
[2:02:43] I believe the message I have faith
[2:02:47] I'm glad you have that faith
[2:02:50] because that's where the will allow you
[2:02:54] to hear this
[2:03:04] excuse me
[2:03:09] the people don't have faith today
[2:03:12] like they had in that day
[2:03:16] some kind of canker worm or some sort
[2:03:19] has got in
[2:03:21] God
[2:03:23] got in
[2:03:25] and eaten off the lifeline of faith
[2:03:30] they changed it
[2:03:35] today our faith rests upon some kind of
[2:03:38] big church denomination
[2:03:41] but Jude told us
[2:03:44] in the third verse
[2:03:46] he said behold I give all diligence to
[2:03:49] write unto you of common salvation for
[2:03:53] it was needful me to write unto you have
[2:03:56] I have told you here before me
[2:03:59] and to exhort you that you should
[2:04:03] earnestly contend for the faith
[2:04:07] for the faith
[2:04:09] that was once delivered unto the Saints
[2:04:12] that was 33 years before this faith
[2:04:17] was delivered
[2:04:27] so our
[2:04:29] faith
[2:04:31] is something that we should earnestly
[2:04:34] contend for
[2:04:36] but we've substituted knowledge for
[2:04:39] faith
[2:04:41] we've substituted things for what faith
[2:04:45] really is
[2:04:46] because the faith if we could this
[2:04:49] morning
[2:04:51] all find where God wants us to put our
[2:04:55] faith
[2:04:57] and we would all put that Faith together
[2:05:00] this morning
[2:05:02] if you are Brokenhearted
[2:05:05] you will be mended
[2:05:10] I don't know when
[2:05:12] I don't need instant results
[2:05:18] if you're backslid
[2:05:21] you'll have a desire to be renewed again
[2:05:25] if you're all sick
[2:05:27] you'll know that there's a fountain for
[2:05:30] you
[2:05:32] faith is not a hope so
[2:05:35] it's an Evidence
[2:05:38] and the problem of God is going to tell
[2:05:41] us exactly what that evidence is
[2:05:48] and I'm gonna have you read it
[2:05:53] so you know this is not a fancy sermon
[2:05:58] it's not enticing words
[2:06:02] it's what the messenger is telling us
[2:06:05] that we're lacking
[2:06:12] and I'm not too proud
[2:06:17] to humble myself
[2:06:20] before the Vindicated word of God
[2:06:35] so we we see that he tells us that
[2:06:39] our faith
[2:06:42] he says here he says in paragraph 80
[2:06:48] when we were called Saints
[2:06:51] when they were Sanctified the Holy
[2:06:54] Spirit Sanctified them
[2:06:56] they were called Saints
[2:06:58] now Jude says Brothers
[2:07:01] Foster brother of Jesus I want you to
[2:07:06] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[2:07:08] once delivered to the Saints
[2:07:11] don't never let that Faith drop
[2:07:18] and the faith of the Saints
[2:07:22] was not in Creeds
[2:07:26] not in denominations
[2:07:29] not in church buildings
[2:07:34] now I hear it all the time at home we're
[2:07:36] building a building
[2:07:38] and there isn't a day that someone
[2:07:41] doesn't pull into my parking lot and say
[2:07:46] oh you're building a church that's
[2:07:48] wonderful God must be really moving
[2:07:55] I can't build my faith in that
[2:07:59] and in fact really their their voices of
[2:08:02] distraction
[2:08:05] look what God's doing
[2:08:08] they're moving from here they're moving
[2:08:11] from there they're coming in you know
[2:08:14] the prophet of God told us there'd be a
[2:08:16] false Revival
[2:08:22] and it's going on now
[2:08:25] people's faith is that they speak in
[2:08:27] tongues that they prophesy
[2:08:30] where's that
[2:08:33] zapper
[2:08:42] their faith
[2:08:44] they're resting place
[2:08:47] is in their Fellowship
[2:08:49] one with another
[2:08:51] in what we believe
[2:08:54] I believe the prophet said this I
[2:08:57] believe the prophet taught that I I
[2:08:59] believe that well to the outside world
[2:09:02] that's just your Creed
[2:09:08] they believe their Creeds right they
[2:09:11] believe it's the word of God they'll
[2:09:14] defend it with their life
[2:09:16] they'll give you scripture after
[2:09:18] scripture after scripture after
[2:09:19] scripture
[2:09:23] but that's not what he wants us to build
[2:09:25] our faith in
[2:09:27] that is not what the believer
[2:09:32] rests in
[2:09:41] is not in church buildings
[2:09:44] not in associations
[2:09:48] well we're starting to develop all kinds
[2:09:51] of Ministerial Association
[2:09:53] me and wrong Fellowship together me and
[2:09:56] this brother Fellowship together and and
[2:09:58] I stream this brother and I stream that
[2:10:01] brother
[2:10:04] I'm glad you streamed
[2:10:07] give the voice of God
[2:10:11] equal time
[2:10:14] God only asked for 10 percent
[2:10:22] you know why you stream here
[2:10:25] and stream there
[2:10:27] because you can't find what's satisfying
[2:10:29] you
[2:10:36] you're looking for a new flavor
[2:10:40] man's never changed
[2:10:43] and the word of God
[2:10:44] has never changed
[2:10:48] he's the same
[2:10:53] that's because we've
[2:10:55] we've slipped
[2:11:02] we are not the church we should be
[2:11:06] we present everything else
[2:11:09] out there
[2:11:12] oh how many Sunday school rooms do you
[2:11:14] got you got five I'm going to build six
[2:11:19] how many chairs do you have in here you
[2:11:22] got maybe 250 I'm gonna put 375.
[2:11:28] now I'm The Voice
[2:11:35] the prophet of God said there's no Unity
[2:11:39] people are Trucking Spears at each other
[2:11:42] over their Doctrine interpretation
[2:11:49] well there's I don't know of anybody so
[2:11:51] it was a greater sinner than me
[2:11:56] I can't even speak of those things
[2:11:59] which were done in darkness
[2:12:03] lest the spirit
[2:12:07] attach it
[2:12:14] let's just take a moment
[2:12:19] and catch this together
[2:12:24] it's built on associations
[2:12:27] not in associations
[2:12:30] but faith
[2:12:32] of the Saints is built in this one thing
[2:12:37] but it was in the presence
[2:12:40] of the Living God
[2:12:48] they had faith
[2:12:51] to heal the sick
[2:12:53] to cast out Devils to do miracles
[2:12:57] all these great promises that Jesus made
[2:13:01] that first church
[2:13:04] held on to that
[2:13:07] it was the lifeline
[2:13:11] now he said the reason that they could
[2:13:14] do all these Works was not because of
[2:13:17] the command
[2:13:21] I see so many people come God told me to
[2:13:24] go into all the world and lay up my
[2:13:25] hands on the sick you can lay your hands
[2:13:28] in the sick all you want
[2:13:31] that's not what faith is built in
[2:13:35] the disciples faith
[2:13:38] was built when they went into that Upper
[2:13:42] Room at Pentecost
[2:13:44] that he said I'll be with you
[2:13:48] even in you
[2:13:50] till the end
[2:13:51] their faith was built on the presence of
[2:13:57] Jesus Christ
[2:13:59] they knew he was there
[2:14:03] [Applause]
[2:14:08] that's what they did the works by
[2:14:12] they did the works because they knew
[2:14:16] he was there
[2:14:20] their faith was not
[2:14:23] in the letter
[2:14:26] their faith was in his presence
[2:14:32] that's what they believed how many notes
[2:14:34] are messengers stood there and he was
[2:14:36] talking and talking and talking he says
[2:14:39] you know I'm waiting for something
[2:14:41] and then all of a sudden he's here
[2:14:45] he's here
[2:14:47] I take every spirit in this building in
[2:14:51] my control in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:14:53] what did he put his faith in he put his
[2:14:56] faith in because he was here
[2:15:04] their faith was in the presence
[2:15:08] what was the whole Ministry in this day
[2:15:13] what was it all about
[2:15:17] he came back
[2:15:20] and he veiled himself
[2:15:25] in a prophet
[2:15:27] did the same works that he did when he
[2:15:30] was here to identify his presence with
[2:15:35] us
[2:15:40] because this church was only going to
[2:15:42] rise up
[2:15:45] it was only gonna
[2:15:48] be what it was meant to be when it
[2:15:51] turned back to the foundation of faith
[2:15:54] and that Faith was not in his doctrines
[2:15:57] not in his Creed your faith isn't that
[2:16:00] God sent a prophet God sent Ezekiel God
[2:16:03] sent Jeremiah God sent John the Baptist
[2:16:06] try to put your faith in that you've got
[2:16:09] to put your faith in him because he's
[2:16:12] here
[2:16:13] get up
[2:16:14] [Applause]
[2:16:18] not up there
[2:16:21] not in here
[2:16:24] this is the identification by which you
[2:16:27] know that it's him
[2:16:34] but the church
[2:16:35] faith
[2:16:39] is built on one
[2:16:41] thing
[2:16:43] his
[2:16:45] presence
[2:16:47] that he is here
[2:16:50] to perform and do that which he said he
[2:16:55] would do
[2:16:57] if you're looking for an anointing
[2:16:59] you're looking for a spirit you're
[2:17:02] looking for a certain atmosphere you
[2:17:04] will miss it
[2:17:07] but when you know
[2:17:10] behind the shadow of a doubt
[2:17:13] that he's here
[2:17:15] he's here he said he would be here
[2:17:19] I know he's here
[2:17:21] I feel he's here I see that he's here
[2:17:24] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:17:27] forever and he's here to do what he said
[2:17:29] he would do if that's what my faith
[2:17:32] anchors in my faith anchors in the
[2:17:35] presence
[2:17:45] oh I don't want a church
[2:17:48] that socially
[2:17:50] epped
[2:17:57] I want a church that's got the presence
[2:18:04] management
[2:18:07] that when they walk through those doors
[2:18:10] they're not looking
[2:18:12] to judge what's being said
[2:18:14] they're looking for one thing Lord do I
[2:18:17] see you
[2:18:18] are you here
[2:18:20] Lord and if you're not here I want this
[2:18:22] church to know I brought them
[2:18:27] I want you to this morning to know I
[2:18:29] brought them
[2:18:35] you may not believe that but I'm here to
[2:18:37] tell you I come from God and I go to God
[2:18:45] I brought them because I brought his
[2:18:47] word
[2:18:48] I brought the voice of the messenger to
[2:18:51] you
[2:18:53] and he told me that he is here to
[2:18:56] perform every thing that he promised
[2:19:04] you say well I'm a sinner he knows that
[2:19:11] I've done this he knows that
[2:19:14] you think there's something he don't
[2:19:15] know
[2:19:20] we all want to get well before we take
[2:19:22] the medicine
[2:19:30] there's only one thing that's going to
[2:19:32] fix you
[2:19:35] and that's his presence
[2:19:40] and there's only one thing that's going
[2:19:42] to make it work
[2:19:43] is when God grows it
[2:19:47] when God fixes it
[2:19:49] all he asks you to do do you believe
[2:19:53] that he's here
[2:20:00] no do you really believe he's here
[2:20:04] that his person
[2:20:07] is here
[2:20:10] and I want to go into all this well he's
[2:20:12] veiled in the bride
[2:20:14] well if I have to see what bride they
[2:20:17] say they are
[2:20:18] I ain't looking there
[2:20:21] I'm looking at the pulpit I'm not
[2:20:24] looking at one thing
[2:20:26] unknowing one thing he has a visible
[2:20:31] presence
[2:20:33] that's manifested by The Works that he
[2:20:36] does
[2:20:39] and he said that he's here
[2:20:46] if you've been struggling
[2:20:49] and that worm's been eaten your heart
[2:20:54] if you could anchor your faith
[2:20:57] that he's here
[2:21:00] to do for you
[2:21:03] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[2:21:07] you could ask or think
[2:21:09] you can have
[2:21:11] what you asked for
[2:21:16] but if you think my prayer
[2:21:22] or my lane on of hands
[2:21:26] you say well that's what the Bible said
[2:21:28] but he said that it's through Christ
[2:21:30] Jesus that we do
[2:21:33] all things
[2:21:35] all things are performed by his presence
[2:21:43] if the faith
[2:21:45] in his presence
[2:21:48] that was the foundation of the church
[2:21:51] they sat like cowards in the upper room
[2:21:55] faith I thought this was him I thought
[2:21:58] this in we heard it was right he said go
[2:22:02] and Tarry tell
[2:22:05] I come
[2:22:07] I will send you another comforter for I
[2:22:13] will be with you
[2:22:15] and even in you until the end
[2:22:21] I don't care what you're struggling with
[2:22:25] he's here he knows it he sees it
[2:22:28] but if you know he's here he's here to
[2:22:31] do for you
[2:22:39] he would send His Garment
[2:22:43] out over the congregation
[2:22:46] trying to get the people to believe he
[2:22:49] was here you sir
[2:22:51] you're suffering with heart trouble
[2:22:56] the Lord knows that
[2:22:59] he's here
[2:23:02] do you recognize it do you feel that
[2:23:04] sensation all over you that's him
[2:23:09] what was he trying to get him to realize
[2:23:12] that he was here
[2:23:18] he said you know you think it's me I'll
[2:23:21] turn my back to the audience you little
[2:23:24] sister back there right over here to my
[2:23:27] right that's Desiring to have a baby God
[2:23:30] hears you
[2:23:33] why
[2:23:35] what was he trying to get their faith in
[2:23:40] him
[2:23:43] no
[2:23:45] he was a vessel
[2:23:47] he was trying to let him know he's here
[2:23:49] he's present
[2:23:51] he's using me the vessel the prophet of
[2:23:54] God to show you that he's here and that
[2:23:57] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:24:00] forever
[2:24:01] and if you think you can run to him 2
[2:24:04] 000 years ago you can run to them
[2:24:06] tonight because he's here
[2:24:14] but that's not where our faith is
[2:24:18] our faith is in our Doctrine
[2:24:22] our faith is in our building
[2:24:25] our faith is in our association
[2:24:30] I didn't say it
[2:24:37] that was spiritual food and due season
[2:24:41] that he put in the storehouse
[2:24:44] because one day he knew he would have to
[2:24:47] go back in there and bring that food to
[2:24:50] his church
[2:24:52] so they could turn their hearts
[2:24:57] and get rid of the Catholic spirit
[2:25:00] that thinks you're going because you
[2:25:02] belong
[2:25:13] you say Brother David while you're
[2:25:15] preaching children I need you
[2:25:23] I need the church
[2:25:26] to rise up
[2:25:30] I got an enemy
[2:25:34] that's trying to bury people so far deep
[2:25:39] the Troubles of their heart and mind is
[2:25:42] devouring their very insides
[2:25:50] I need just one person in here that
[2:25:52] would agree with me that he's here
[2:25:55] then no devil in hell can stand in our
[2:25:58] bed I'm not afraid to make the challenge
[2:26:00] he's here to keep his word
[2:26:03] [Applause]
[2:26:12] is your faith
[2:26:16] built on his presence
[2:26:19] or is it built on the doctrine of your
[2:26:22] brain
[2:26:27] run our brains start to fail us
[2:26:32] but his presence
[2:26:35] it has never failed me
[2:26:39] if I don't pronounce my words right if I
[2:26:41] don't walk right if I can't think
[2:26:43] there's one thing that I know he lives
[2:26:48] and he's here
[2:26:50] and he'll do what he said he'll do
[2:26:56] would you read one more paragraph with
[2:26:58] me
[2:27:05] I guess the musicians can come
[2:27:12] I wish you knew that little song
[2:27:15] we sing at home called stay
[2:27:21] it says stay
[2:27:23] I don't want you to go
[2:27:29] I've got such a hunger in my heart I
[2:27:32] need you so
[2:27:33] it's a beautiful song
[2:27:36] because I don't want that presence to go
[2:27:41] because that's where my faith is
[2:27:44] my faith is when he preaches the word
[2:27:47] then he's there to perform it and my
[2:27:51] faith is in his presence
[2:27:56] you say I thought it was the word
[2:28:01] he
[2:28:03] is the word amen amen
[2:28:08] the letter killeth
[2:28:11] but the presence
[2:28:13] that spoke those words
[2:28:16] is here
[2:28:19] that's the
[2:28:21] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:28:27] is the presence that's outside of you
[2:28:31] that saves you
[2:28:34] and heals you
[2:28:37] the one you had to recognize
[2:28:40] [Music]
[2:28:42] to come get what you have need of
[2:28:45] the fall down at his feet
[2:28:49] and that's for healing our blessing
[2:28:55] he performs
[2:28:57] what he said he would do
[2:28:59] and then he comes from the outside to
[2:29:03] the inside
[2:29:05] and you say I have them
[2:29:12] have you ever failed
[2:29:16] numerous time
[2:29:19] but he's the resurrection
[2:29:22] and the life
[2:29:24] [Music]
[2:29:26] he promised me he wouldn't leave me
[2:29:29] nor forsake me
[2:29:32] I'm going to read this statement
[2:29:39] and this morning if you have a need
[2:29:42] [Music]
[2:29:45] and you believe his presence is here
[2:29:50] You Can Touch the Hem in your seat
[2:29:52] [Music]
[2:29:54] but if you believe that
[2:29:56] praying for you would help
[2:30:01] maybe you feel you're just outside of
[2:30:04] that presence
[2:30:06] [Music]

[2:31:50] perform and to do and to act and to live
[2:31:55] with the people as he did at the

[2:32:01] if the presence of the Living God
[2:32:04] brought a Pentecost with powers with
[2:32:08] signs with wonders
[2:32:11] it brought it people so full of the
[2:32:14] glory of God till they shouted spoke
[2:32:16] with other languages went and martyred
[2:32:20] for the faith

[2:32:27] Lee contended for that faith
[2:32:31] until death
[2:32:33] shall set us free
[2:32:36] earnestly contend for it we will not
[2:32:40] compromise
[2:32:42] upon reading books
[2:32:46] taking some man-made theology
[2:32:50] we will not compromise upon Creed or
[2:32:52] some prayer book
[2:32:54] or something
[2:32:56] somebody
[2:32:57] else has said
