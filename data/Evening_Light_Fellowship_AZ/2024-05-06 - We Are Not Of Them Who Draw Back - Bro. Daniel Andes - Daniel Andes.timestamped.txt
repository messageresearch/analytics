[50:34] Hebrews chapter 10 I want to read two
[50:36] verses and then we'll come back and
[50:39] preach through these verse number 38
[50:41] Hebrews 10:38 now the just shall live by
[50:44] faith but if any man draw back my soul
[50:48] shall have no pleasure in him but we are
[50:51] not of them who draw back un predition
[50:54] but of them that believe to the saving
[50:56] of the souls I want to take a thought
[50:59] this morning we are not of them that
[51:00] draw back that's right we are not of
[51:03] them that draw back may God add his
[51:04] Blessing to the word you may be
[51:06] seated amen I was thinking about
[51:10] something the other day and I want to go
[51:12] through this chapter I want to go back
[51:14] just a little bit to verse number 10
[51:16] because sometimes in our message
[51:18] sometimes things uh you know and we have
[51:22] to go back to the basics of what we
[51:24] believe and I was thinking of verse
[51:26] number good to see you brother Patterson
[51:28] sister Patterson God bless you over 20
[51:31] years ago he came to our church and he
[51:33] preached that God will make you the head
[51:35] and not the tail God wants to bless your
[51:37] life I remember that it had an impact on
[51:39] my life don't believe that the words
[51:41] that you speak don't echo on through
[51:43] eternity and affect people's lives amen
[51:46] may God help us brother Ron every sermon
[51:48] you preached had an effect amen every
[51:51] prayer you've prayed the Bible says the
[51:53] effectual F come on somebody the
[51:56] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[51:58] man avails much don't listen to the
[52:00] devil said it hit the ceiling and it
[52:02] came back down when God's word says it's
[52:05] very effectual and it's having an effect
[52:07] brother Russell every prayer that you
[52:09] prayed out on the trail God heard it and
[52:11] God remembers it Cornelius the angel
[52:14] come to him and said your prayers have
[52:15] been heard and they've come up before
[52:18] God as a
[52:19] memorial amen and we're not of those
[52:21] that draw back verse number 10 cutting
[52:24] right into the middle of this chapter
[52:26] said by by which we are Sanctified
[52:28] through the offering of the body of
[52:30] Jesus Christ once and for all I'm here
[52:32] to tell you that our Salvation comes
[52:34] from Jesus Christ it does not come from
[52:37] a man does not come from a church does
[52:40] not come from the ministry does not come
[52:43] from William brandom it comes from Jesus
[52:45] Christ Alone why do you believe that
[52:48] brother Daniel because the Bible says so
[52:50] the Bible says so we need to get back to
[52:52] our foundations and roots that we are
[52:54] made nigh to God by the blood of Jesus
[52:57] Christ is that scripture then Ephesians
[52:59] and Colossians verse number 14 for by
[53:02] one offering he hath perfected forever
[53:05] them that are Sanctified whereof the
[53:07] Holy Ghost also is a witness the Holy
[53:10] Ghost should be a witness to you amen
[53:12] that he Sanctified you that he's done a
[53:14] work in your life it's just not
[53:16] something in your head but God will send
[53:17] back the witness of the Holy Ghost that
[53:20] he's accepted your sacrifice how many
[53:22] believe it today say Lord Breathe on Me
[53:24] Maybe you never had that Witness Lord
[53:27] send the witness of the Holy Ghost to me
[53:29] today blessed be the name of the Lord I
[53:32] was thinking of this verse 24 and let us
[53:35] consider one another to provoke one
[53:37] another unto love and to Good Works go
[53:39] ahead and nudge somebody on the right
[53:41] side of you just nudge them nudge
[53:43] somebody on the left side provoke means
[53:46] to strongly irritate them yeah there you
[53:48] go irritate them provoke them under love
[53:51] and good works wake up brother wake up
[53:53] Sister let's be Christians you sleepy
[53:55] sleep on your own time don't sleep on
[53:57] God's time we're in God's house God's
[54:00] wanting to speak to us who in the world
[54:01] would go in the presence of a mighty man
[54:03] and just sit there lethargically you
[54:05] might even dress up a little bit you
[54:07] might shave and uh how was it David when
[54:09] he was in the prison he went up he
[54:11] shaved his face and took a bath and got
[54:13] cleaned up he was going before someone
[54:15] who had great Authority we're in the
[54:17] presence of God today our creator The
[54:20] God Who changes situations he never
[54:23] Ethan brother Ethan goes into a
[54:25] situation but what he does doesn't
[54:26] change it amen as we were talking uh on
[54:29] Friday night a word from the Lord and I
[54:31] believe God gave a word from the Lord to
[54:34] individuals last night we spoke to the
[54:36] young people how that God knows you and
[54:38] Psalms 139 God knows your down settings
[54:41] he knows your uprisings your cell phone
[54:44] is Satan's uh technology and it knows
[54:46] when you lay it down and when you pick
[54:48] it up but God many many thousands of
[54:50] years ago said I already know your Downs
[54:52] settings and your uprisings Lucifer and
[54:55] Satan Eden just trying to produce what
[54:57] God already does he knows those things
[54:59] when he went over to David and David
[55:01] encountered some things in his life
[55:02] pornography and then adultery and then
[55:04] illegitimate child and then a conspiracy
[55:08] and are you with me today this is a man
[55:10] after God's Own Heart went through deep
[55:12] dark Waters in his life but Psalms 51
[55:15] after that he said Lord create in me a
[55:17] Clean Heart Lord create in me a right
[55:20] spirit and whatever you do brother
[55:22] Patterson don't take your Holy Spirit
[55:24] from me don't take it from me God don't
[55:27] take it from me I need the spirit of God
[55:30] God don't take it from our churches
[55:32] where would we be without the spirit of
[55:36] God blessed be the name of the Lord I've
[55:39] walked amen God has sent justification
[55:41] amen by faith he sent a sanctification
[55:44] the by the washing of the water of the
[55:46] word to wash us to know what we should
[55:48] be washed from and what we should be as
[55:50] the bride and then he sent the
[55:51] quickening power of the Holy Spirit to
[55:53] Quicken us amen and I believe it I got
[55:55] to have it when I preach I got to have
[55:57] the Bible says we have an unction of the
[56:00] Holy Ghost we're not up here to read a
[56:02] bunch of quotes and and read some be
[56:04] part of the me too preacher movement no
[56:06] it's not that it's the unction of the
[56:07] Holy Ghost one time I was in a service
[56:10] and and my I went out and uh we brother
[56:13] said you know I had to preach and you're
[56:15] kind of nervous it was an elder and he
[56:16] went out and he had to explain this is a
[56:18] Pulpit this is the monitor this is this
[56:20] and this and I'm like I'm like David
[56:22] like I don't know about all this armor
[56:24] and this stuff just give me something
[56:26] that I know give me something of the
[56:29] holy spirit in my life that delivered me
[56:31] of habits and things that I couldn't
[56:34] deliver myself some give me something
[56:36] that I know we went back in the back
[56:38] room we held hands you might as well
[56:40] been holding this this little thing
[56:42] right here I thought Lord Jesus I need
[56:43] something more than that I need more
[56:45] something more than technology and we
[56:47] need something more than technology we
[56:49] need something more than the letter the
[56:50] letter will kill you but the spirit I

[59:06] 3,000 denominations that were holding
[59:08] the same Bible and God sent us a Divine
[59:11] interpreter of the word of God and I'm
[59:13] so thankful that God sent a prophet and
[59:15] his name was William brandham and I'm
[59:17] not ashamed of it I know your your
[59:19] pastor's not ashamed of that name God
[59:21] wasn't ashamed when he came down and has
[59:23] a picture taken with him and if the
[59:25] angel Lord wasn't ashamed of him I don't
[59:27] want to be ashamed of him say brother
[59:29] Daniel do you have all the answers to
[59:30] the to the to the questions and and

[1:00:02] we're living in a days when so much
[1:00:04] information comes to our mind we were
[1:00:06] talking about a couple of years ago they
[1:00:07] said a hundred years ago and this is an
[1:00:10] old article but they said a newspaper
[1:00:12] was about that thick a Sunday newspaper
[1:00:14] they said a hundred years ago the
[1:00:15] information that was in that one Sunday
[1:00:17] newspaper was more information that an
[1:00:20] individual lived a hundred years ago
[1:00:22] encountered in their whole lifetime they
[1:00:24] were just up on the hill and and now
[1:00:26] newspapers they've done away with the
[1:00:27] newspapers and now we're so bombarded
[1:00:29] with with uh uh um uh information and
[1:00:32] and we get it used to be they had a 30
[1:00:34] uh uh second um on the television they
[1:00:37] have 30 seconds and the 15 seconds and
[1:00:39] now it's 7 seconds if you're
[1:00:40] interviewing somebody and you don't move
[1:00:42] and and and like that because we're we
[1:00:44] become um what is it the dopamine
[1:00:46] junkies we got to have a dopamine H and
[1:00:48] move and and so we're
[1:00:53] uh a lot of people are dopamine addicts
[1:00:57] their natural body has to kick in
[1:00:59] dopamine they say that's a whole another
[1:01:01] sermon it's called we are not ignorant
[1:01:03] of his devices but when your phone dings
[1:01:05] dopamine is released in your brain it's
[1:01:07] more addictive than cocaine and a
[1:01:09] person's got
[1:01:13] to and then they take phones from kids
[1:01:15] and they Wonder kids go crazy they take
[1:01:18] cocaine from a CO and they go it's more
[1:01:21] addictive and so you wonder what it is
[1:01:22] we need to say Lord don't let me be
[1:01:24] addicted even too
[1:01:26] myself God Saved Me From
[1:01:29] Myself amen given our free nature we

[1:02:12] blessed be the name of the Lord Jude the
[1:02:14] first chapter verse number five the
[1:02:17] Bible says I will therefore put you in
[1:02:19] remembrance though you once knew this
[1:02:21] how that the Lord having saved the
[1:02:23] people out of the land of Egypt
[1:02:25] afterward destroyed them that believe
[1:02:27] not if you read a couple verses later in
[1:02:30] verse 7 the bible says this is written
[1:02:31] for an example God saved them out of
[1:02:34] Egypt and they did not continue to
[1:02:36] believe amen they went into unbelief and
[1:02:38] they destroyed actually they destroyed
[1:02:41] themselves they wandered in the
[1:02:42] wilderness amen may God help us today we
[1:02:44] live in a generation back to the whole
[1:02:46] thing of dopamine and so we get like
[1:02:48] this and we got to have information but

[1:02:52] help us in this generation God knew this
[1:02:54] generation was coming and God has molded
[1:02:56] and shaped men that they will minister
[1:02:59] in the same capacity amen how we say you

[1:03:03] British they all lined up it was

[1:03:38] shooting here and and that's the way the
[1:03:40] sometimes the preaching of the word it's
[1:03:41] not when I grew up they come out and
[1:03:44] they had a stack of books brother Ron
[1:03:46] this High and the brother picked up a
[1:03:47] book and he read a quote and he said it

[1:03:51] still halfway through and he come back
[1:03:53] you're like wow but we're not maybe like
[1:03:55] that today but God is taking a quote
[1:03:57] over here and a scripture over here and
[1:03:58] an inspiration like a sniper and going
[1:04:01] down into a young person's life and said
[1:04:03] look you need to flee that thing that
[1:04:04] thing is taking you a spirit of suicide
[1:04:06] that you follow that down there and
[1:04:08] you'll desire to take your
[1:04:11] life may God help us today amen May the
[1:04:14] Holy Spirit come and be a discerner I
[1:04:16] believe he's still a discerner amen I

[1:04:29] playing a beautiful song that's a gift
[1:04:31] from God Amen I don't have that gift I
[1:04:33] could spend my whole life doing it but
[1:04:34] God has given him a gift may God anoint
[1:04:37] your gift and may the Holy Spirit come
[1:04:39] to you if you surrender your life to you
[1:04:40] he will bless you you give it to the
[1:04:42] devil he'll destroy you and take
[1:04:43] millions of souls to Hell amen God has
[1:04:46] put placed gifts in every one of our
[1:04:48] Lives amen we need to yield ourselves to
[1:04:51] the Lord and say Lord whatever I am may
[1:04:53] you take me amen and use me brother Ezra
[1:04:55] an engineer that God will take you and
[1:04:57] use you in the capacity that he wants to
[1:05:00] use you in however great however small
[1:05:03] usually it's something small we've got
[1:05:06] this ideology that minister to be a
[1:05:08] minister you got to have a microphone in
[1:05:10] your hand that's not what a minister is
[1:05:12] a minister is someone who finds the
[1:05:14] greatest need in the church it doesn't
[1:05:17] matter if there's a mouse coming through
[1:05:19] this church the greatest minister is the
[1:05:20] one that's going to catch the mouse and
[1:05:22] get rid of it right the need may God
[1:05:24] help us say Lord let be used in your
[1:05:26] kingdom Jesus Use Me Lord don't refuse
[1:05:30] me surely there's a work that I can do
[1:05:33] even though it's humble amen Lord let me
[1:05:35] be humble as well Lord and carry out the
[1:05:38] work of Christ amen Romans the first
[1:05:40] chapter this is a powerful chapter if
[1:05:43] you the day that we live in you should
[1:05:46] read this it's
[1:05:48] amazing praise the Lord Romans the 1
[1:05:51] chapter 21 we're not going to read this
[1:05:52] whole chapter the Bible says because of
[1:05:54] that they knew God they glorified him
[1:05:56] not as God neither were thankful but
[1:05:59] became vain in their imaginations and
[1:06:01] their foolish heart was darkened
[1:06:02] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:06:04] became fools now watch this we're
[1:06:07] talking about Humanity changed the glory
[1:06:09] of the uncorruptible god unto an image
[1:06:13] made like to corruptible man and to
[1:06:15] birds and four-footed beasts and
[1:06:18] creeping things now we think oh that's a
[1:06:21] bunch of idols and things like that but
[1:06:23] I want you to look at this verse again
[1:06:25] these people have changed the glory of
[1:06:27] an uncorruptible God the Bible says all
[1:06:30] things Colossians I believe all things
[1:06:32] were created by Him and for him Jesus
[1:06:34] Christ and people have taken this
[1:06:37] uncorruptible God and made into made him
[1:06:40] into an image like to corruptible man
[1:06:43] listen to me right here you say what
[1:06:44] does that mean brother Daniel when
[1:06:46] people will go through things in their
[1:06:47] life and maybe there's a separation of
[1:06:49] family and they say well I think I can
[1:06:52] Remar again because God listen to me
[1:06:54] because God will understand don't you
[1:06:57] realize that's the Fulfillment of that
[1:06:59] scripture you have taken The
[1:07:01] Incorruptible Eternal God who knows no
[1:07:04] sin that Angels stood for millions of
[1:07:05] years and cried holy holy holy and you
[1:07:08] have brought him down and made him like
[1:07:10] to you which is a corruptible man and
[1:07:13] said oh God will understand God
[1:07:16] understands one thing and that's his
[1:07:18] word god understands his word I'll say
[1:07:21] this if God was going to overlook one of
[1:07:23] his words he would have done it in the
[1:07:24] Garden of Eden that's right he's not
[1:07:26] going to overlook his word amen verse 24
[1:07:30] this is powerful wherefore God gave them
[1:07:33] up to
[1:07:34] uncleanness through the lust of their
[1:07:36] own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[1:07:38] between them and change the truth of God
[1:07:40] into a lie and worshiped and served the
[1:07:44] creature more than the Creator who is
[1:07:46] blessed forever amen this is a powerful
[1:07:49] verse verse number 28 if you don't have
[1:07:51] this marked in your Bible do you believe
[1:07:53] in marking in your Bibles AR minds are
[1:07:55] weak okay Noah heard the word voice of
[1:07:58] God one time for 120 years he built an
[1:08:01] ark in our generation God knew we would
[1:08:03] be weak and there' be social media and
[1:08:04] all these things flying he said look I'm
[1:08:06] going to give you a Bible Daniel just
[1:08:07] when you get weak just read your Bible
[1:08:09] amen just read your Bible verse 28
[1:08:12] powerful verse and even as they did not
[1:08:14] like to retain God in their knowledge
[1:08:17] what is God he is the word of God
[1:08:19] because they did not like to retain
[1:08:21] brother Ron this Bible the word of God
[1:08:23] in their knowledge what did God do God
[1:08:26] gave them over to a reprobate mind to do
[1:08:28] those things which are not convenient oh
[1:08:31] you're sitting here and say God just
[1:08:32] give me a love for your word Lord and
[1:08:34] whatever you do don't turn me over to a
[1:08:36] reprobate mind amen Lord don't turn me
[1:08:39] over to a reprobate mind in another
[1:08:41] place it says to believe a lie and to be
[1:08:43] damned by it I'm not going back amen
[1:08:46] how's it say in Isaiah 559 the Bible
[1:08:49] says as the heavens are higher than the
[1:08:50] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:08:53] ways and my thoughts than your thought
[1:08:55] thoughts God's thoughts are not your
[1:08:57] thoughts they're higher than you are
[1:08:59] that's right you believe that today amen
[1:09:01] amen there's something bigger than
[1:09:04] you young Brothers there's something
[1:09:06] stronger than you there's something
[1:09:08] bigger than you it's Jesus
[1:09:10] Christ
[1:09:12] amen Romans 12: 2 is it all right to
[1:09:17] read the Bible in this church you know
[1:09:19] in some countries it's uh forbidden to
[1:09:22] read the
[1:09:23] Bible but we believe it amen
[1:09:26] Romans
[1:09:27] 12:2 and be not conformed to this
[1:09:31] world but be ye transformed by the
[1:09:34] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:09:36] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:09:38] perfect will of God people talk about
[1:09:41] trans well I guess I'm
[1:09:45] trans I'm transformed amen trans means
[1:09:50] to go across and Beyond and through amen
[1:09:53] transform to make through or ADD
[1:09:55] thorough or drastic change in the form
[1:09:57] and the appearance and the character and
[1:10:00] the Bible says be not conformed to this
[1:10:02] world but Daniel you need to be
[1:10:04] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:10:08] amen you just not come from a polywog
[1:10:10] but in the beginning God created the
[1:10:13] heavens and the Earth God created Man In
[1:10:15] His Image do you believe it today and
[1:10:17] you need to be transformed by the
[1:10:19] renewing of our mind when the devil
[1:10:21] would try to destroy us and get our
[1:10:23] minds down and sh Shannon sung the song
[1:10:26] God bless you Shannon for singing that
[1:10:28] song I'm Letting
[1:10:30] Go am man we've all got baggage we've
[1:10:32] all got stuff from our past can you say
[1:10:34] amen I can't control what's back there I
[1:10:37] can't control who my father and mother
[1:10:39] were I was blessed to have a Godly
[1:10:41] father and mother the most worldly thing
[1:10:43] we ever sang in our song was Happy
[1:10:44] Birthday and Humpty Dumpty we never we
[1:10:47] never heard a country song never heard
[1:10:49] that nonsense I was raised in a Godly
[1:10:51] home but maybe some of you weren't
[1:10:52] that's okay God loves you maybe you
[1:10:55] never had a father he said I'll be a
[1:10:57] father to the
[1:10:58] fatherless thank you
[1:11:01] Jesus if you can ever take this this is
[1:11:05] Christ in word form and read it and say
[1:11:09] this is God speaking to me we talk
[1:11:11] Thursday night about a word from the
[1:11:12] Lord Brother Robert some have gone
[1:11:15] through things in our culture and our
[1:11:17] societies but if you can get alone and
[1:11:19] say the Bible says I will be a father to
[1:11:21] the fatherless than you you will be my
[1:11:24] son you will be my
[1:11:26] daughter come out from among them and be
[1:11:29] separate you'll never get that in the
[1:11:31] fast lane of Life you'll never get that
[1:11:33] on the fast lane of the internet
[1:11:35] somewhere it's men and women getting
[1:11:36] alone with God In Prayer so we talking
[1:11:39] to the young people the Bible says pray
[1:11:42] lest you enter into temptation that's
[1:11:44] where we're failing brother Saunders as
[1:11:46] people have have stopped praying and
[1:11:48] they're wanting to go to church and the
[1:11:49] preacher wave a magic wand over them and
[1:11:52] come with a new revelation and wave it
[1:11:54] over but that's not what Jesus is saying
[1:11:56] he's saying you need to pray am you're
[1:11:59] falling down all the time you need to
[1:12:01] spend time in prayer it's not a magic
[1:12:03] one it's not a new revelation it's time
[1:12:06] in prayer Pray lest she enter into
[1:12:08] temptation teach us to pray he says Lord
[1:12:11] lead us not into temptation but Deliver
[1:12:13] Us from Evil that's good for all of
[1:12:17] us what was that saying I wrote down at
[1:12:19] the
[1:12:20] bottom I was reading it said the call of
[1:12:23] depression the feel the feeling of
[1:12:26] depression is your call to
[1:12:31] prayer listen to
[1:12:33] me be transformed by the renewing of
[1:12:36] your mind most people feel think that
[1:12:39] the feeling of depression is to go to
[1:12:41] the psychiatrist and get pills but the
[1:12:44] feeling of depression is your call to
[1:12:48] prayer write that down the feeling of
[1:12:51] depression is your call God I need you
[1:12:54] Lord God I can't make it Lord I've got
[1:12:57] as we grow older brother we get
[1:12:59] disappointments in life and the hurts
[1:13:00] and pains they come and you sit there
[1:13:02] and the devil will take you to but KN
[1:13:03] it's your call to prayer all things work
[1:13:06] together for good amen the good times
[1:13:09] the bad times and even in David would go
[1:13:11] back and say I was a man after God's Own
[1:13:14] Heart I was anointed by God and I've
[1:13:15] created this terrible thing but here we
[1:13:18] are 4,000 years later reading the Bible
[1:13:21] and it's being for our edification to
[1:13:23] realize those men weren't perfect I'm
[1:13:25] not perfect but Lord you didn't throw
[1:13:27] him

[1:13:33] knees and say I've sinned David laid on
[1:13:36] his face said I've sinned I've done
[1:13:38] wrong but I'm Still The King I'm still
[1:13:41] dead I get up and go on in spite of the
[1:13:45] shame in spite of the reproach amen amen
[1:13:48] the devil you think you don't think
[1:13:50] going to church means something then why
[1:13:52] when you make a mistake listen to me
[1:13:54] does the devil tell tell you don't go to
[1:13:58] church why is that if it doesn't mean
[1:14:00] anything to the devil that people go to
[1:14:02] church why is it when you make a mistake
[1:14:04] the first thing will devil tell you
[1:14:06] don't go to church those people know
[1:14:08] about it I tell you what we need to be
[1:14:10] Overcomers Lord let me
[1:14:12] overcome amen the greatest battle ever
[1:14:14] fought is in my mind I'm going to church
[1:14:17] I'm going to the house of God because in
[1:14:20] the house of God Supernatural things
[1:14:22] happen Amen in the house of God evil
[1:14:24] spirits are cast
[1:14:26] out I'm way ahead of myself but Mark 16
[1:14:29] if you have your Bibles this is our
[1:14:30] identification brother random preaches
[1:14:32] it sry right to take my coat off here
[1:14:34] amen thank you brother Ron this is our
[1:14:37] identification this building should not
[1:14:39] be your identification as a Christian
[1:14:41] Amen brother b f uh how is it five
[1:14:43] definite identifications of the true
[1:14:45] church and brother bam goes through five
[1:14:47] things that identify the church he takes
[1:14:49] us right to Mark 16 this is my
[1:14:51] identification as a Believer it's not
[1:14:53] because I believe the message it's it's
[1:14:55] not because I go to brother Ron church
[1:14:56] it's not because I say I'm in the
[1:14:58] message what does that mean this is my
[1:15:01] identification Mark 16 we'll back up a
[1:15:04] few verses because it's all the inspired
[1:15:06] word of God right not just Mark 16 17
[1:15:10] but Mark 1615 is also
[1:15:14] inspired and he said unto them go ye
[1:15:16] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:15:19] to Every Creature somebody's got to do
[1:15:21] that somebody's got to do that that's
[1:15:24] why I'm standing here today because
[1:15:26] somebody has to fulfill that word and
[1:15:28] someday I'll stand at the Judgment of
[1:15:30] God and God says look Daniel I told you
[1:15:32] to go preach the gospel amen I told you
[1:15:35] to study Paul told Timothy give yourself
[1:15:37] to to exhortation and to reading and
[1:15:40] probably I don't know people do it it
[1:15:42] cost me like eight hours probably for
[1:15:44] every sermon every hour it's just like
[1:15:46] Lord this is not efficiency I tell my
[1:15:48] wife couldn't that's to be an easier way
[1:15:49] to do this there has to be an easier way
[1:15:52] 4:00 this morning I woke up and I'm just
[1:15:54] beginning to pray Lord Jesus I don't
[1:15:55] know what to say God what our words are
[1:15:58] meaningless we live our information
[1:16:00] going through but God if you'll take the
[1:16:02] words and you'll direct them to every
[1:16:05] heart every mother and every Father Can
[1:16:08] Be Touched by the spirit of God
[1:16:11] information is meaningless but the power
[1:16:13] of the Holy Spirit spoken Jesus said my
[1:16:16] words are spirit and they're life right
[1:16:20] so if the anointed word of God will come
[1:16:22] inside of you and I can be trans trans
[1:16:25] formed by the renewing of my mind Lord
[1:16:28] let me be transformed Mark 16 let's go
[1:16:30] to 16 he that believeth and is baptized
[1:16:32] shall be
[1:16:35] saved if you're not baptized in this
[1:16:37] room
[1:16:38] today the Bible says he that believeth
[1:16:41] and is baptized shall be
[1:16:43] saved the Bible goes on to
[1:16:46] say but he that believeth not shall be
[1:16:49] damned and these signs shall does your
[1:16:52] Bible say shall not May these signs
[1:16:56] shall follow them that believe in my
[1:16:59] name they shall cast out Devils that's
[1:17:02] why we take the name of Jesus with you
[1:17:04] it's not it's the name of Jesus and the
[1:17:07] preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:17:09] will cast out Devils how many found that
[1:17:11] to be true you come say Lord I I don't
[1:17:14] know it's kind of foggy Lord I don't
[1:17:15] know did I just get into this did I just
[1:17:17] marry into this thing how did I just
[1:17:18] stumbl is but the preaching of the
[1:17:20] Gospel cast those demons away so you're
[1:17:23] talking about Moses he comeing the
[1:17:25] presence of something Supernatural the
[1:17:26] bush he says I'll turn aside and see why
[1:17:29] this doesn't isn't consumed I'll see
[1:17:31] what this something is of the holy
[1:17:32] spirit that keeps moving in my life
[1:17:34] how's the Bible say when he the holy
[1:17:36] spirit is come he will convince the
[1:17:38] world convict the world of
[1:17:40] sin so how can sin dwell in churches and
[1:17:44] not have conviction come in somewhere
[1:17:47] the church has been falling down to a
[1:17:50] place of Ecclesia is the called out
[1:17:52] that's what it is in the I believe it's
[1:17:54] the Greek it's the Ecclesia they've come
[1:17:56] down and the world has had a form of
[1:17:57] godliness and they can dwell together it
[1:18:00] shouldn't be that way amen when we come
[1:18:02] into the presence of God and the Holy
[1:18:04] Spirit you shouldn't s be able to sit
[1:18:06] there and the Holy Spirit not discern
[1:18:08] sin in your life is that what the Bible
[1:18:10] says when he the Holy Spirit has come I
[1:18:12] think I'm saying it right brother
[1:18:13] patteron he will convince and convict
[1:18:15] the world of
[1:18:17] sin oh may God help us today he's quick
[1:18:20] and powerful he's a discerner of the
[1:18:22] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:18:24] you know what people walk away from
[1:18:25] something because it doesn't do anything
[1:18:27] for them walk away it doesn't do
[1:18:28] anything for me but when I take a drink
[1:18:30] of that brother Robert
[1:18:33] Hallelujah am and it becomes a part of
[1:18:36] me Jesus said taste and see that the
[1:18:38] Lord is
[1:18:39] good sitting up here brother Robert
[1:18:42] something moving in his heart watched a
[1:18:44] tear fall off and hit his tie and roll
[1:18:46] down strong man that just doesn't happen
[1:18:48] in this day right strong but I tell you
[1:18:52] what real men cry amen real men moved by
[1:18:55] the Holy Ghost it's more than your
[1:18:57] ambition it's more than money and
[1:19:00] Prestige because I tell you one day it
[1:19:02] won't mean anything the Bible says we
[1:19:04] shall all stand before the Judgment seat
[1:19:06] of God you're not going to stand there
[1:19:08] with your bank account you're not going
[1:19:09] to stand there with your career and your
[1:19:11] prestigious things you're going to stand
[1:19:13] the Bible says all things were naked and
[1:19:15] bare before him so we know that day is
[1:19:18] coming we've got the book it's an open
[1:19:20] book test so why not come into the
[1:19:22] presence of God today and say Lord here
[1:19:23] I am I'm bear I'm open I'm naked before
[1:19:26] you Lord as David said Lord create in me
[1:19:29] a Clean Heart Lord create in me a right
[1:19:31] Spirit are you with me today I'm glad I
[1:19:34] go to a church where the holy spirit is
[1:19:35] there he can convict of sins amen maybe
[1:19:38] something that's hid you've buried it
[1:19:39] way down underneath but the Holy Spirit
[1:19:41] knows he there and he'll pull it up and
[1:19:43] bring it to the Forefront it shouldn't
[1:19:45] take years to bring things to the
[1:19:46] Forefront it should be the freedom of
[1:19:48] the Holy Spirit to just be free in the
[1:19:49] church most people don't want that in
[1:19:51] our church they want a little form and
[1:19:53] keep God In The Box because if we let
[1:19:55] God out of the box who knows what God
[1:19:57] would say happened in ananas it's the
[1:19:59] safar's day the man Comm in said I sold
[1:20:01] the land for so much Peter just you sell
[1:20:03] it for sold much yeah I sold it for so
[1:20:04] much Peter said you've not lied to men
[1:20:07] you've lied to almighty God and the
[1:20:09] Bible says he fell dead we know the
[1:20:10] story and the Bible said fear come on
[1:20:12] the church there ought to be such a fear
[1:20:14] of God that come on the Church of God
[1:20:15] before we walk in that door say Lord
[1:20:17] forgive me of my sin Lord don't call it
[1:20:20] out Lord Jesus don't call it out here I
[1:20:22] I confess my sins because I tell you you
[1:20:24] come into the presence of God and the
[1:20:26] Holy Spirit will call it
[1:20:30] out it's the Holy Spirit say Lord Jesus
[1:20:34] don't don't say it to others I'll find a
[1:20:36] place I I'll ask you to forgive me Lord
[1:20:39] I've done wrong oh I love the presence
[1:20:41] of the
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:44] Lord thank you
[1:20:46] Lord the Bible says as many as he loves
[1:20:49] he chastens and rebukes thank you Lord
[1:20:52] Brother Russell and it's never abuse
[1:20:55] some I had a father that loved me I had
[1:20:58] a great home life but I know others
[1:21:00] didn't and maybe there were abuse that
[1:21:02] went on in your home I'm sorry it's
[1:21:06] Jesus Christ is not the fault of that
[1:21:09] it's sin that caused that amen it's sin
[1:21:11] that caused that but we do have a
[1:21:13] heavenly father that when we do wrong he
[1:21:15] takes us in a room and he sits us down
[1:21:17] and say look I want to talk to you you
[1:21:20] don't do that you're a Son of God you
[1:21:22] don't talk like that you don't cuss like
[1:21:24] that you don't steal like that we're
[1:21:25] sons of God say but Daddy I really want
[1:21:28] to do it well son I've got something
[1:21:30] here it's called the Holy Ghost in Fire
[1:21:32] and if you'll take this it'll burn that
[1:21:34] desire it'll burn the want to out of
[1:21:36] your life and that's our problem we
[1:21:38] don't dwell long enough in the presence
[1:21:40] of God to let the fire of God consume
[1:21:42] and take the want to out of our life
[1:21:45] amen I I've been around a long time
[1:21:47] brother Robert I've seen people after
[1:21:49] the service they sit down and they
[1:21:50] meditate I I believe in meditation it
[1:21:53] takes something greater than medit ation
[1:21:55] it takes the fire of the Holy Spirit say
[1:21:58] Lord come into my life and burn these
[1:22:00] desires out of my life God lord create
[1:22:03] in me a Clean Heart Lord I need a right
[1:22:05] spirit I don't even like that sister
[1:22:07] Lord Jesus how are we going to spend
[1:22:08] time in heaven
[1:22:12] together we're not going to get it
[1:22:14] worked out over there we're going to get
[1:22:16] it worked out here I'll say this the
[1:22:18] preachers aren't even going to get it
[1:22:20] worked out over there they got to get it
[1:22:22] worked out over here and it's such a
[1:22:24] shame that it has to go right before
[1:22:25] people die like hey I'm sorry I'm like
[1:22:27] hey we lost 20 years yeah I'm not
[1:22:31] families people get things in the
[1:22:32] family's life I can tell you life is too
[1:22:34] short to not talk to your son or
[1:22:36] daughter life is too short to not call
[1:22:39] somebody and say hey I love you in spite
[1:22:42] of whatever I still love
[1:22:44] you blessed be the name of the Lord I
[1:22:46] don't know why it's going there but I
[1:22:48] tell you we're not of those that draw
[1:22:49] back but we're those that believe to the
[1:22:51] saving of our souls this will fix home
[1:22:53] life this will fix a lot of things Mark
[1:22:55] 16 we're all over the place but that's
[1:22:57] okay in my name you'll cast out Devils
[1:23:00] they'll speak with new tongues do you
[1:23:01] believe in speaking with
[1:23:02] tongues I'm sorry I didn't write it it's
[1:23:05] in there so I just say Lord don't let my
[1:23:07] unbelief try to figure out why not to
[1:23:08] make it happen Lord just Lord let me be
[1:23:11] so full of the Holy Spirit I become a
[1:23:12] Believer and maybe you have a gift or
[1:23:14] maybe you pray in the spirit blessed be
[1:23:16] the name of the Lord that's a whole
[1:23:18] another sermon I'll let your pastor

[1:23:23] any deadly thing shall not harm them it
[1:23:26] shall not hurt them and they shall lay
[1:23:27] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:23:31] I believe it's James brother Robert said
[1:23:32] if there's somebody sick we have some
[1:23:34] oil up there he believes in James 5:14

[1:24:03] medicine amen Hebrews 11: 23 the Bible's
[1:24:08] talking about Moses by faith Moses when
[1:24:11] he was born was hid three months of his
[1:24:15] parents Hebrews
[1:24:17] 11:23 they saw that he was a proper
[1:24:19] child and they were not afraid of the
[1:24:21] king's commandment by faith Moses when
[1:24:23] he was called to years refused to be
[1:24:25] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter you
[1:24:29] know the word is written there but then
[1:24:32] God will take the scripture and make it
[1:24:34] flesh the Bible says and the Word was
[1:24:36] made flesh that's the word of God that
[1:24:39] was written and then God makes it flesh
[1:24:42] and it dwells among us and we beheld his
[1:24:44] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:24:46] Son of God is it right to preach your
[1:24:48] testimony sister Sandy right

[1:25:14] Christian but something had happened in
[1:25:16] Sister sy's life and to me that's the
[1:25:19] scripture becoming flesh amen and then
[1:25:21] the Bible says that Moses refused to be
[1:25:24] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:25:26] sister Sandy said I am Christian what's
[1:25:28] Christian means
[1:25:30] Christlike amen I'm a Protestant what's

[1:26:10] to stand up amen put your your game face
[1:26:12] on and say Lord I I didn't call myself
[1:26:15] into
[1:26:16] this I was telling the young people I
[1:26:18] was raised in a message home the brandom
[1:26:20] Tabernacle and my my teacher told me you
[1:26:22] got the filthiest mouth in this chrisan
[1:26:24] school and I was a mess and I walked
[1:26:26] down and gave my heart to the Lord I
[1:26:28] didn't finish the testimony God changed
[1:26:30] my heart I called my girlfriend and said
[1:26:32] look it's not going to happen Okay I'm
[1:26:35] going a different way God's changing my
[1:26:37] desires and that's what God's in the the
[1:26:38] heart changing desire amen that's what
[1:26:41] he was he wants to change your heart
[1:26:44] change your desires we need that today
[1:26:47] how many know what I'm talking about
[1:26:49] when you say that's really me that's who
[1:26:51] I am I chase the L and the Fashions and
[1:26:53] the movies I just can't stop then you
[1:26:55] need a change of heart and we've all
[1:26:58] lived long enough to see those people
[1:27:00] just kind of dabble dabble in the God's
[1:27:03] not wanting dabblers he wants Warriors
[1:27:06] people that are called Chosen and
[1:27:08] faithful I believe Revelation chapter 17
[1:27:11] those that came with him riding on a
[1:27:12] white horse they were called Chosen and
[1:27:15] they were faithful they were faithful to
[1:27:18] the house of God why we're covering a
[1:27:20] lot of ground today youall are pulling
[1:27:23] in so many Direction verse 25 choosing
[1:27:25] rather to suffer the afflictions of the
[1:27:27] people of God they chose they chose to
[1:27:32] suffer you chose to be a
[1:27:36] Christian Angel come to brother bam said
[1:27:38] you chose the harder way where's brother
[1:27:41] Steve mcney after last night he gave
[1:27:44] this the prophecy the angel come to
[1:27:46] brother say you've chose the harder way
[1:27:48] amen it is God's way you believe the
[1:27:51] word of God you're going to be despised
[1:27:53] and rejected of men so be it amen Paul
[1:27:57] said in the way that's called heresy so
[1:27:59] worship I the god of our fathers long
[1:28:02] hair skirts Prophet
[1:28:05] cult and the way that's called heresy so
[1:28:08] worship by the god of our fathers it's
[1:28:10] in the Bible no one was baptized any
[1:28:13] other way but in the name of the Lord
[1:28:15] Jesus Christ or they had to come back
[1:28:17] and be re-baptized to get the holy
[1:28:20] spirit is that what we believe I'm not
[1:28:22] of those that draw back
[1:28:24] amen I'm still a Protestant I'm still
[1:28:27] listen to this I'm still protesting
[1:28:29] something that killed 68 million of my
[1:28:32] brothers and
[1:28:34] sisters they killed 68 million of my
[1:28:38] brothers and sisters come on I want you
[1:28:41] to listen to this because if you know
[1:28:43] anything about the fox book of Martyrs
[1:28:46] they would take a cross a little
[1:28:48] crucifix and maybe they were there and
[1:28:50] they were getting ready to tie the the
[1:28:51] um the oxen on you tie them on your hand
[1:28:54] hands and your feet and they just pulled
[1:28:55] them apart and they would hold a cross
[1:28:57] in front of your face and all listen to
[1:28:59] me all they had to do was kiss the cross
[1:29:02] there's a cross we have it in our church
[1:29:04] it's a symbol of Christ right but to
[1:29:07] them when they were kissing the cross it
[1:29:09] was an allegiance to a
[1:29:12] system and they said I will not be
[1:29:14] identified with that system the same as

[1:33:26] prophet of God said it's Gathering them

[1:33:30] fighting and desensitizing our society
[1:33:33] to killing people someday there may be
[1:33:35] the Christians all that could never
[1:33:37] happen no that same system that killed
[1:33:39] 68 million of my brothers and sisters
[1:33:41] turned them loose to the Lions we need
[1:33:43] to shake ourselves from this world and
[1:33:46] save ourselves say Lord bring a right
[1:33:48] spirit inside of me Lord we need the
[1:33:50] Holy Spirit we need to be sensitive we
[1:33:53] watch too many YouTube short videos and
[1:33:56] and and Instagram and it's desensitized
[1:33:58] us amen
[1:34:01] Jesus come
[1:34:03] on I was a Sunday school teacher one of
[1:34:05] my Sunday school teachers he was a he
[1:34:08] was agent and he got involved in some of
[1:34:11] the martial arts things and one day he
[1:34:14] they told us well he's fighting in this
[1:34:15] thing and I logged on to watch it and
[1:34:18] and he was in this Arena and they were
[1:34:20] hitting him and he was fighting I was a
[1:34:21] Sunday school teacher the Bible says
[1:34:23] Jesus went about doing good healing all
[1:34:25] that were oppressed of the devil right
[1:34:27] holy spirit's in you it'll do the same
[1:34:29] thing I'm a Sunday school teacher trying
[1:34:30] to teach them the things of God and
[1:34:32] every time the man would hit him I was
[1:34:33] like oh God no that's my that's my child
[1:34:37] that's my Sunday school student don't
[1:34:38] hit him don't hit him and you realize we
[1:34:40] become so desensitized people can shoot
[1:34:43] and kill and murder and all of that oh
[1:34:45] God help us to to be sensitive to the
[1:34:47] Holy Spirit when we see those things
[1:34:50] just get away from it that's trying to
[1:34:51] desensitize us and laugh laugh in and
[1:34:54] joking when the Bible says listen to me
[1:34:56] in he Ephesians chapter 6 all those that
[1:34:59] love Christ in
[1:35:01] sincerity there's some things that are
[1:35:03] sacred there're sacred things this is
[1:35:07] sacred amen I grew up in a generation
[1:35:09] where we didn't lay anything on it we
[1:35:11] didn't you didn't lay a pen on it you
[1:35:12] didn't lay anything because this is the
[1:35:14] word of God Jesus said my word is spirit
[1:35:17] and life I had a friend he did some
[1:35:19] terrible things in motel rooms he said
[1:35:20] the first thing I would do is take the
[1:35:21] Bible stick it in drawer and push it out
[1:35:23] because you can't do it in the presence
[1:35:25] of the word of God Amen that's why every
[1:35:27] day you should read your Bible and pray
[1:35:29] it doesn't matter where you read it open
[1:35:30] the Bible because when you open the
[1:35:32] pages the spirit of God begins to come
[1:35:34] out I don't understand it but I know
[1:35:36] it's the
[1:35:38] truth see what if should we bring this
[1:35:40] is this okay brother Ron you can get up
[1:35:41] behind me and correct this all
[1:35:43] right and so whatever you do we're in
[1:35:46] uncharted waters and things happen is
[1:35:48] this is this good is this good and I'll
[1:35:49] tell you how to tell you bring it in the
[1:35:51] presence of God Amen and whatever you do
[1:35:54] in your house and then before you go to
[1:35:56] bed I assume you all read your Bible and
[1:35:57] pray brother Ram said we start every day
[1:35:59] like that we end it every day and then
[1:36:01] you say okay now we're going to read our
[1:36:02] Bible and pray and if whatever you did
[1:36:05] that's a variable right there asteris
[1:36:06] it's a wild card whatever you did if you
[1:36:09] can't read your Bible and pray after
[1:36:10] that you need to do away with whatever
[1:36:13] that is right you fill in the blank mama
[1:36:18] you should be the one like all right
[1:36:19] we're going to
[1:36:20] have we're tired we're all going to go
[1:36:22] to and everybody kind of disa appears
[1:36:23] and goes to the room there's something
[1:36:25] wrong we need to bring the spirit of God
[1:36:27] back in and open our Bibles and just
[1:36:29] start reading it over there in the
[1:36:30] Psalms and the spirit of God discerns
[1:36:32] and dad says look we're not doing that
[1:36:34] anymore I say there's no shame in saying
[1:36:37] I'm in uncharted waters but I realize
[1:36:39] that it's too shallow right here this
[1:36:41] boat will never float in its path this
[1:36:44] family will never go on with this going
[1:36:46] on in our home are you with me today I
[1:36:49] tell you Mom ought to be the first one
[1:36:50] say hey if we continue on this path
[1:36:52] how's the Bible say hearken into the
[1:36:53] voice of your wife your wife says look
[1:36:56] this is not putting our young men on the
[1:36:57] right course this one
[1:37:00] sister if I do wrong you correct me
[1:37:04] brother's taking his his sons all to the
[1:37:05] basketball games or the basketball games
[1:37:07] are
[1:37:08] all and so one day the mom like I think
[1:37:11] I'll go and they brought her and they
[1:37:12] set her down and there's a cheer
[1:37:13] cheerleaders right in there and she's
[1:37:15] like you've been bringing my sons to
[1:37:17] this and brother Daniel's praying for
[1:37:19] him in the prayer line trying to get him
[1:37:20] delivered from pornography and you set
[1:37:22] him in front of this like oh this is a
[1:37:24] good what about the what
[1:37:26] about Bible says they ran from a lion
[1:37:28] they put their hand on a wall and a
[1:37:29] snake pit him may God help us today say
[1:37:32] Lord help me today will you lead me and
[1:37:35] guide me it's the Holy Spirit oh let's
[1:37:37] just turn him loose turn him loose in
[1:37:39] the room and say God get me away from
[1:37:41] the danger get me away from that get me
[1:37:43] away from the cliff I'm not trying there
[1:37:45] one man said we know the story of The
[1:37:46] Chariot Rider man said I need somebody
[1:37:48] to hire I go around this mountain man
[1:37:51] said I can drive within 4 inches of the
[1:37:54] edge of that man said that's that's no I
[1:37:57] can I've slid my Chariot within two
[1:37:58] inches man said what about you he said
[1:38:02] uh I'm a
[1:38:04] conservative whether you like the word
[1:38:06] conservative or not I try to say as far
[1:38:08] away as I can from the edge Heen let the
[1:38:11] world call you an old fogy and let them
[1:38:13] call you oldfashioned that's okay I try
[1:38:15] to stay away from the edge amen our
[1:38:18] virtues are are sisters amen the reason
[1:38:20] we you know we were talking we read it
[1:38:22] over here on Friday night the Satan come
[1:38:24] and said surely you'll not die right for
[1:38:26] God knows in the day that you eat
[1:38:28] thereof you'll be wise like a God and
[1:38:31] God is depriving you the Bible says for
[1:38:34] a woman to be dressed in modest apparel
[1:38:37] he's depriving of you because if you'll
[1:38:39] is this okay brother Ron if you dress an
[1:38:41] immodest apparel people will look at you
[1:38:43] you'll have more likes you'll probably
[1:38:45] be able to become an influencer and
[1:38:47] you'll make a lot of money being able to
[1:38:49] work from
[1:38:51] home not realizing that the Bible says
[1:38:54] you need to be in modest apparel because
[1:38:56] you have value that's right if there is
[1:38:59] another generation to come and young
[1:39:01] people that sit in a church it can only
[1:39:02] come through the bedding ground of a
[1:39:04] woman and it's holy we have a little
[1:39:06] garden I don't let people go and pour
[1:39:08] gasoline in our garden because that
[1:39:10] place is sacred and set aside for a
[1:39:13] reason is everybody mature and you're
[1:39:15] thinking with me and we guard that kids
[1:39:17] come and play in our yard but they don't
[1:39:19] get in the garden because it's a sacred
[1:39:21] place and we protect it and we cover it
[1:39:23] over and that is kept sacred for a man
[1:39:25] someday that you'll give yourself to it
[1:39:27] has value amen remember lot when he was
[1:39:30] down there he came and he came and he
[1:39:32] said look take my daughters he had no
[1:39:34] value for virginity there was no value
[1:39:37] for moral character are you with me
[1:39:39] straight out of the Bible and lot said
[1:39:41] look just take my daughters oh but up
[1:39:42] there there was Abraham he was listening
[1:39:45] to the voice of Elohim amen it was
[1:39:47] deserting his thoughts and we're sitting
[1:39:48] in just not any church we're sitting in
[1:39:50] a church that believes in discernment of
[1:39:52] the Holy Spirit believe God is a
[1:39:54] personal God he'll come down to every
[1:39:56] one of you this little girl sitting here
[1:39:58] that God give her a life and somebody
[1:40:00] sitting beside her that cares for God
[1:40:01] has a future for her and he loves her he
[1:40:04] has a future for every one of
[1:40:06] you and he's watched over you every day
[1:40:08] of your life thank you Lord and he's
[1:40:12] seen every tear that you cried and every
[1:40:13] heartache and pain that you've had and
[1:40:16] my Bible tells me that there's a coming
[1:40:17] a time where Christ will come out and
[1:40:19] he'll wipe every tear from your eye so
[1:40:21] don't worry it's all over
[1:40:24] you chose a harder way but that's why
[1:40:25] you're here today with
[1:40:27] Christ blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:40:29] we've got to get through this they
[1:40:30] quenched the violence escaped the edge
[1:40:32] of the sword out of weakness were made
[1:40:34] strong V wax valy and fight turned to
[1:40:37] flight the armies of the aliens women
[1:40:39] received their dead raised the life
[1:40:42] again verse 37 they were stoned that's
[1:40:44] not that kind of stones it's rocked and
[1:40:47] they were swn
[1:40:50] aund they were tempted were slain in
[1:40:53] with the sword they wandered about in
[1:40:55] sheep skins and goat skins being
[1:40:57] destitute Afflicted tormented of whom
[1:41:00] the world was not worthy amen verse 37
[1:41:04] they were tempted and I guess we're all
[1:41:05] tempted but I'm not going
[1:41:07] back amen Lot's wife is a memorial of
[1:41:10] somebody that turned back I am not going
[1:41:12] to be that kind of a memorial I'm going
[1:41:14] to die trying I'm going to die fighting
[1:41:17] brother R said if you lined up a prayer
[1:41:19] line of 500 people and I prayed for
[1:41:21] every one of them and every one of them
[1:41:22] 500 died he said tomorrow night I'd be
[1:41:24] on this platform preaching Divine
[1:41:26] Healing that God Is A Healer God Is A
[1:41:28] Healer he's a savior amen David the
[1:41:31] Bible says he ran towards Goliath he
[1:41:32] didn't run away from it he ran towards
[1:41:34] Goliath he was anointed amen there's a
[1:41:37] group of people that are anointed by the
[1:41:39] Holy Spirit they're not running amen
[1:41:41] they're anointed by the holy spirit for
[1:41:43] a reason God has chose you in this day
[1:41:45] in the darkest hour it's never been this
[1:41:47] day to dark and God chose you he chose
[1:41:50] me I'm aside from the times I got to
[1:41:53] spend hours on my knees bringing myself
[1:41:55] my mind and the battles into the place
[1:41:57] that I can Minister the word of God and
[1:41:59] become a a channel that God can use me
[1:42:01] and say Lord anoint me that I can speak
[1:42:03] the word of God mom may God anoint you
[1:42:05] to be the Fifth
[1:42:07] Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John and mother

[1:42:14] written in your book I'm not drawing
[1:42:16] back away from Holiness I'm not drawing
[1:42:18] back away from baptism in jesus' name
[1:42:20] amen I'm not drawing back away from the
[1:42:22] power of God say brother Daniel how can
[1:42:24] I do it that's a good question isn't it
[1:42:27] Mary said that how can these things be
[1:42:29] right the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:42:31] overshadow you hallelujah how am I going
[1:42:34] to make it brother Daniel the Holy Ghost
[1:42:36] brother Amos is going to overshadow you
[1:42:38] Hallelujah you're going to go to a
[1:42:39] church and just not a cold formal six
[1:42:41] months before they print a program we're
[1:42:43] just getting through it no we just go in
[1:42:44] there and say Lord speak just say it
[1:42:47] Lord just say it and Minister like the
[1:42:49] other night we were ministering a word
[1:42:51] from the Lord and yesterday just praying
[1:42:53] with the sisters and Tears In Her Eyes
[1:42:55] tears are a
[1:42:57] language that God understands amen I'll
[1:43:02] say it again tears are a language that
[1:43:05] God understands blessed are the broken
[1:43:08] in
[1:43:10] spirit amen blessed are the pure in
[1:43:12] heart they're going to see God how many
[1:43:14] want to see God then you got to be pure
[1:43:17] in your heart you're going to have to
[1:43:18] lay aside the world and the things of
[1:43:20] the world if you ever amount to anything
[1:43:22] amen you you're going to have to turn
[1:43:23] your face amen the Bible said he set his
[1:43:26] face as a flint towards Calvary what was
[1:43:28] that self- crucifixion self-denial Lord
[1:43:31] I'm going to set my face as a flint when
[1:43:33] we live in a world when the Bible says
[1:43:34] there'll be lovers of their own selves
[1:43:36] that's why there's iPhones and ie this
[1:43:38] everybody's they worshipers of
[1:43:39] theirselves but somebody's going to lay
[1:43:41] down their own will like Christ said not
[1:43:43] my will Lord let your will be done
[1:43:46] there's a group of people like that
[1:43:49] let's go to Genesis chapter 17 I'm
[1:43:51] trying to go through this
[1:43:53] we are not of those that draw back but
[1:43:55] those to believe unto
[1:43:57] salvation how am I going to do it well
[1:43:59] let's go back and look at somebody in
[1:44:00] the Bible because the Bible says all
[1:44:01] this was written as examples right so
[1:44:04] Genesis 17:1 and when Abram was 99 years
[1:44:09] old it's the father of our faith he was
[1:44:12] 99 years old the Lord appeared to
[1:44:14] Abraham and said unto him I am the
[1:44:16] almighty God walk before me and be thou

[1:44:38] message a Creed I was listening to it
[1:44:40] the other day I was preach listening to
[1:44:42] a message I think it's the way back or
[1:44:44] ausa Revival brother rand's talking he
[1:44:46] said now you Pentecostals listen to me
[1:44:48] right here I'm going to preach can the
[1:44:51] denomination why we're not an organiz
[1:44:53] ation and brother R he's preaching to
[1:44:54] Pentecostal people he said your families
[1:44:56] come out of denominations he said you
[1:44:58] look at Revelations chap 17 the the
[1:45:00] mother and the harlots and
[1:45:02] blasphemous names Baptist and Methodist
[1:45:04] but he said you could become a
[1:45:06] Blasphemous name as yourself if you
[1:45:08] don't have the Holy Spirit dwelling
[1:45:09] inside of you we'd say Amen oh look at
[1:45:11] those Pentecost but let's just bring it
[1:45:13] down home a little bit farther let's
[1:45:15] come 50 years later downside and we're
[1:45:17] looking back yeah those Pentecostals
[1:45:19] called those Methodist and Baptist and
[1:45:20] said it was Blasphemous names we can see
[1:45:23] the Pentecost but what about in our
[1:45:26] message and we say oh I'm a message
[1:45:28] believer and unless you have the life
[1:45:30] inside of you it can become Pentecost is
[1:45:34] not a bad word it was they made it a
[1:45:36] denomination the message is not a bad
[1:45:38] thing it came from God but we hide under
[1:45:40] a cloak sometime and it can become a
[1:45:42] Blasphemous name and deception to
[1:45:48] you it's not just believing the message
[1:45:51] I can tell you the Bible says the Vil
[1:45:53] believes and trembles the Bible says
[1:45:55] have you received the Holy Spirit have
[1:45:57] you received the quickening power since
[1:45:59] you believe the message oh blessed be
[1:46:01] the name of the Lord walk before me and
[1:46:03] be you perfect if you have a sko filled
[1:46:05] Bible he goes into that the almighty God
[1:46:08] almighty God is Hebrew L which is the
[1:46:11] strong one Shad is breast Shad ey is the
[1:46:14] breasted one amen the strong breasted
[1:46:16] one and there's a people that are
[1:46:18] Nursing From elshad the breasted God
[1:46:21] they're reading their Bible in the dark
[1:46:22] darkest age they're nursing from God
[1:46:24] they're praying and tapping into a
[1:46:26] strength and a power they're listening
[1:46:28] to a prophet's voice that God has stored
[1:46:31] up you remember brother branham's desire
[1:46:33] was not to store the tapes up it was the
[1:46:34] angel of the Lord that told him go and
[1:46:37] record those there's coming a time when
[1:46:39] you'll be gone and people will be
[1:46:41] feeding that we need to be listening to
[1:46:42] The Prophet's voice we are not
[1:46:45] independent churches around that are
[1:46:48] just good preachers and we're no we're
[1:46:49] following a message Revelations 18 come
[1:46:52] out from among her and be ye separate
[1:46:55] sayeth the Lord we're following a
[1:46:56] message well what are you doing
[1:46:57] preaching brother Daniel well we just
[1:46:58] read it in Mark 16 right going to all
[1:47:00] the world and preach the gospel we had a
[1:47:02] prophet that turned our faith back to
[1:47:04] the Faith of Our Fathers and we're
[1:47:05] encouraging you I'm not telling you
[1:47:06] don't listen to it I'm telling you look
[1:47:08] there's 1,200 of you you should go and
[1:47:09] listen to it it doesn't matter which one
[1:47:11] just pick one up and listen to it God
[1:47:13] will strengthen your heart he'll
[1:47:14] strengthen your faith amen and the other
[1:47:17] thing you should do is go to church when
[1:47:19] you get down so low
[1:47:22] you can't see what's up you'll go and
[1:47:24] somebody will play music The Bible
[1:47:26] brother random says it takes it from
[1:47:28] David there playing music cast out
[1:47:31] Devils you come and somebody starts
[1:47:33] playing a song sister Jill brother
[1:47:35] Austin Justin they play a music and an
[1:47:38] evil spirit like hey yeah how'd I get
[1:47:41] here I don't know but I'm here go to
[1:47:43] church it's what the Bible says for
[1:47:45] forsake not the assembling yourselves
[1:47:46] together amen I was listening to a
[1:47:48] message the other day then Jesus came
[1:47:50] will you give me just a few more minutes
[1:47:52] want to share some testimonies brother
[1:47:54] brandom's in a discernment line and he
[1:47:56] tells us I've just been studying some of
[1:47:58] the early Pentecostal peoples this was
[1:48:00] more than just a healing evangelist
[1:48:01] there was something different and that
[1:48:03] was the sign of the Messiah what Jesus
[1:48:04] did at the woman at the well what
[1:48:06] happened at the tent of Abraham it was
[1:48:08] something different than just a healing
[1:48:09] line that people were healed many people
[1:48:11] had healing Miracles and we believe in
[1:48:13] that but this is something different
[1:48:15] it's an identification that Christ came
[1:48:17] again not in a body but he came as the
[1:48:19] son of man I think it's the anointed
[1:48:21] ones at the end time who is this son of
[1:48:22] man it's Christ the word that has come
[1:48:24] in our
[1:48:25] generation and so brother random is in a
[1:48:27] prayer line he said how do you do sir
[1:48:29] people that never met brother ROM
[1:48:31] brother Ram says I've never seen you in
[1:48:33] my life did I as far as I know you've I
[1:48:36] you've seen me but I've never seen you
[1:48:38] he said well here's one thing I want to
[1:48:40] tell you and we know many times he would
[1:48:43] brother Ram said now I don't know what I
[1:48:44] told you you'll have to go back and
[1:48:45] listen to the tape he said I'm just a
[1:48:47] microphone that God speaks and use my
[1:48:49] voice to pass through so brother randam
[1:48:51] yields himself to the Lord so there's
[1:48:53] one thing I want to tell you he said a
[1:48:54] few nights ago sitting here in the
[1:48:55] audience you accepted your healing from
[1:48:58] a heart trouble so this Angel of the
[1:49:01] Lord that was speaking through brother
[1:49:02] brandom knew that this man a few nights
[1:49:04] ago had had had had been accepted his
[1:49:07] healing his heart trouble he said you're
[1:49:09] standing here for someone it's your
[1:49:11] stepson I want you to watch this here's
[1:49:13] a broken family and things but the angel
[1:49:16] of the Lord God knows this man has a
[1:49:18] stepson he said that's exactly right
[1:49:21] he's got a spinal condition
[1:49:23] that's exactly right he's an alcoholic
[1:49:26] and so now in this broken family with a
[1:49:27] lot of moving parts that brother bam has
[1:49:29] no he doesn't know this man but the
[1:49:32] angel of the Lord is Discerning what is
[1:49:33] happening to this man he said he's an
[1:49:35] alcoholic and he says this you don't
[1:49:38] even know where he's at so here's a man
[1:49:41] who has a stepson and this man doesn't
[1:49:43] even know where this this stepson is but
[1:49:46] now not brother brandom doesn't know
[1:49:48] this man doesn't know but now the angel
[1:49:49] the Lord is coming and knows all about
[1:49:51] the situation that he's alcoholic and
[1:49:53] knows exactly where he's at oh if that
[1:49:56] God is the same yesterday today and
[1:49:57] forever he knows where you're at he
[1:50:00] knows all about your situation he knows
[1:50:02] about your broken family amen and he is
[1:50:04] the answer to every problem that we have
[1:50:07] he's Jesus
[1:50:09] Christ he's Jesus Christ he's in this
[1:50:12] room amen thank you Jes he's in this
[1:50:15] room Paul falls down said who are you
[1:50:18] Lord he said I am Jesus whom now
[1:50:20] persecutest blessed be the name of the
[1:50:22] Lord Lord I've got to go through this
[1:50:24] quickly let's go through this Moses they
[1:50:26] came out brought them out of Egypt 10
[1:50:28] notable Miracles they come out they and
[1:50:31] there's mountains on both sides and now
[1:50:32] here's the Army coming behind him looked
[1:50:34] like God was a terrible General to bring
[1:50:36] him but we are not of those that go back
[1:50:39] and that's when the people started said
[1:50:41] hey conditions got bad we should go back
[1:50:43] but there that's when Moses starts
[1:50:45] crying when you get to that place you
[1:50:46] need to do what other men have done
[1:50:47] before you Moses starts crying to God we
[1:50:50] need to start crying to God I'm not
[1:50:51] talking about saying a prayer I'm
[1:50:53] talking about crying to God like God I
[1:50:54] don't know what to do it's just not me
[1:50:57] it's my family and I got 2 million
[1:50:59] people here and I didn't call myself to
[1:51:01] this place but you called me to this
[1:51:03] place God you brought me to this are you
[1:51:05] with me today and we need to cry out to
[1:51:07] God and then God spoke to him he hears
[1:51:09] the Cry of a Desperate Heart he comes to
[1:51:11] and says Moses why are you crying you
[1:51:13] need to speak and go forward not go back
[1:51:16] to the world but speak and go forward
[1:51:18] brother random said that he said
[1:51:20] sometimes he does that let the doctor
[1:51:21] walk away and say you you ain't going to
[1:51:23] live he said you're going to die
[1:51:25] Cancer's going to kill you you'll never
[1:51:27] get up from that chair seems like he
[1:51:29] leaves you God leaves you with no
[1:51:30] retreat he is your retreat climb up into
[1:51:33] his
[1:51:34] arms there's a natural world in we live
[1:51:37] in but now a prophet is telling why
[1:51:39] don't you climb

[1:51:43] don't you come up higher I hear what
[1:51:45] you're saying C tast I hear I I see what
[1:51:47] you're saying but that's not what I'm
[1:51:49] going to do I'm going to come up a
[1:51:50] little higher into the Arms of Jesus
[1:51:52] Christ Christ he's my refuge he's my
[1:51:56] strong tower the name of the Lord is a
[1:51:58] strong tower the righteous run into it

[1:52:12] church she got breast cancer and we came
[1:52:14] up and we were praying she was pregnant
[1:52:16] with the little boy I don't know if I've
[1:52:17] shared this here before but I'll share
[1:52:18] it again some of you might not have been
[1:52:20] here we we stood around we prayed as as
[1:52:22] a church and we were praying the lights
[1:52:23] all went out the power went out in the
[1:52:25] church and then the lights come back on
[1:52:27] the prophecy went forth and said
[1:52:29] there'll be a dark time in your life but
[1:52:30] God will bring you through it and it'll
[1:52:32] be light again Hallelujah God healed her

[1:52:46] healer here a few years ago she got
[1:52:49] leukemia in her blood and she went to
[1:52:50] the doctor and the doctor looked at her
[1:52:52] because he knew her case he said lady

[1:53:50] give up go forward if your home says
[1:53:52] that you're going to become a fanatic go
[1:53:54] forward amen I remember that when people
[1:53:55] told me you're a fanatic you're going to
[1:53:57] blow your brains out brother Daniel I
[1:53:58] went down I sat by the Ohio River amen
[1:54:00] where the prophet of God was with the
[1:54:02] angel I sat by the rever said Lord I
[1:54:03] don't want to be a fanatic I want to be
[1:54:04] a
[1:54:05] Christian I didn't blow my brains out I
[1:54:09] did lose my
[1:54:10] mind because the Bible says let the mind
[1:54:12] that was in Christ let it be in you and
[1:54:15] only those that have the mind of Christ
[1:54:17] are
[1:54:18] sane anybody that won't accept Jesus
[1:54:20] Christ you might live 100 years and die
[1:54:22] and go to a devil's hell but Jesus said
[1:54:24] I've come that you might have life and
[1:54:26] you'll have eternal life anyone that
[1:54:28] doesn't accept Jesus Christ is out of
[1:54:30] their mind why do I listen to them why
[1:54:32] do I make them the idols and why do I
[1:54:33] want to go to a devil's hell no listen I
[1:54:36] read the back of the
[1:54:38] book I
[1:54:40] wi it's cheating brother Daniel they
[1:54:42] said we could do it as open book I'm
[1:54:44] going to do it read the back of the book
[1:54:46] take advantage of every resource you
[1:54:48] have to win right I read the back and
[1:54:49] those that are with Him amen they win
[1:54:52] amen they're called Chosen and faithful
[1:54:54] I want to be faithful I'm not going to
[1:54:55] draw back but I'm going to believe to
[1:54:57] the saving of my soul I'm going to fight
[1:55:00] I'm going to fight till my last
[1:55:02] breath Hallelujah brother R said speak
[1:55:05] and go forward speak what his word and
[1:55:07] go forward thus sayth the Lord and move
[1:55:09] on a couple more quotes brother Ram said
[1:55:11] when it comes into a person talking
[1:55:12] about the Holy Spirit or persons into a
[1:55:14] congregation into a man or woman he
[1:55:16] vindicates his presence he proves that
[1:55:18] he's there why when God comes
[1:55:20] Supernatural signs begin to appear
[1:55:22] appear do you believe that if he's in
[1:55:24] this room he's Supernatural he'll
[1:55:26] discern your thoughts he'll heal your
[1:55:28] body he'll deliver you amen habits of
[1:55:30] things your life they'll leave in the
[1:55:31] presence of Jesus Christ when Christ
[1:55:34] comes God comes the supernatural signs
[1:55:36] begin to appear this person becomes a
[1:55:38] changed person they become trans not
[1:55:41] their kind of trans they're transformed
[1:55:43] by the renewing of their mind they're a
[1:55:45] Son of God daughter of God made in the
[1:55:48] image of God the lord they're no more
[1:55:51] like they used to be sin has vanished
[1:55:53] from their life fear and doubt has
[1:55:54] vanished frustration they're solid
[1:55:57] they're stable live or die it's Christ
[1:56:00] they don't care what comes or goes
[1:56:01] nothing shake them they move forward my
[1:56:04] goodness I got so many things here I'm
[1:56:06] just going to pass on I'll just preach
[1:56:08] like you know I just preach through this
[1:56:10] you know Hebrews we don't have time to
[1:56:11] read it Hebrews chapter 3 the Bible says
[1:56:13] they didn't mix it with faith Israelites
[1:56:15] they didn't mix it with faith and they
[1:56:16] died in the wilderness they didn't never
[1:56:18] got to the promised land they've never
[1:56:20] got to the rest I'm trying to close they
[1:56:21] never got there brother GE brother
[1:56:23] brother Ron they never got where there's
[1:56:25] amen they had land flowing with milk and
[1:56:27] honey and the benefits and the joys of
[1:56:29] being a Christians they they died in the
[1:56:31] wilderness Jesus said come unto me all
[1:56:33] ye that are weary and heavy laden and
[1:56:34] I'll give you rest they never got to the
[1:56:37] promised land of rest which brother Ram
[1:56:38] says was the type of the Holy Spirit
[1:56:40] rest he goes on to say where they've
[1:56:42] ceased from their own labors you're
[1:56:44] ceased from your own self trying to be
[1:56:46] good by Rehabilitation there is a rest
[1:56:48] to the people of God it's the Holy
[1:56:50] Spirit brother bam goes if you if you
[1:56:52] you just follow that through Isaiah
[1:56:53] chapter 28 the Bible says precept must
[1:56:55] be upon precept line upon line here a
[1:56:58] little there a little for with
[1:56:59] stammering lips and other tongues will I
[1:57:01] speak to this people to whom he saith
[1:57:03] this is the rest wherein ye may cause
[1:57:06] the weary to rest and this is the
[1:57:08] refreshing that shall come from the Holy
[1:57:10] Spirit we need a refreshing of the Holy
[1:57:12] Spirit In Our Lives we need people that
[1:57:14] will go across into canaan's land amen
[1:57:17] sometimes we spit and slobber and cry a
[1:57:18] little bit it's because we're eating the
[1:57:20] grapes we're eating the fruits from that
[1:57:21] Wonder blessed land and there's joy
[1:57:24] there oh sure we're fighting amen every
[1:57:26] day is a fight but we've got joy we've
[1:57:28] got power and we've got Victory we're
[1:57:30] not a defe defeated people we read the
[1:57:32] back and we win we don't look at the
[1:57:34] things that are seen they're temporal
[1:57:36] but the things that are not seen are
[1:57:37] Eternal and the Bible says they saw him
[1:57:40] who was invisible they saw their
[1:57:42] wellbody amen sister pear and they
[1:57:44] walked into it and they're alive today
[1:57:46] amen sister Becky they saw their well
[1:57:47] body and they walked into it Amen
[1:57:49] brother B says Envision that well body
[1:57:51] and just walk into it you say brother
[1:57:53] Daniel I can't overcome this and I can't
[1:57:54] overcome this but he's already overcome
[1:57:57] it walk into Jesus Christ and overcome
[1:58:00] that
[1:58:01] thing blessed be the name of the Lord

[1:58:06] giants it's depression and anxiety but
[1:58:09] greater is

[1:58:15] Canaan land over there amen greater is
[1:58:17] he that is in me and I'm coming for you
[1:58:19] because Footprints mean possession amen
[1:58:23] days on the calendar mean

[1:58:48] we fight all kinds of ites we fight
[1:58:49] websites and all kinds of and IES and
[1:58:53] IES and whatever those things every kind
[1:58:54] of demon of Hell brother man said the
[1:58:56] lid has been taken off of hell every imp
[1:58:58] is out here and that's why 200,000,000
[1:59:01] demons brother Ram said are released on
[1:59:02] the Bride of Jesus Christ we figured it
[1:59:04] up one day I think it was like 20,000
[1:59:06] per demons per person you wonder what
[1:59:08] you're fighting against it's
[1:59:10] demons pray pray pray Daniel the Bible
[1:59:15] says Daniel got down and he prayed and
[1:59:17] an angel come and touched him and
[1:59:18] strengthened him and said be strong be
[1:59:21] strong we need to pray that the angels
[1:59:22] of God Amen will come around and
[1:59:24] strengthen us it happens in prayer it
[1:59:27] happens in prayer I was thinking about
[1:59:30] that they entered the promised land and
[1:59:31] footsteps meant
[1:59:33] possession I was thinking about that
[1:59:35] before they went over they sent two
[1:59:37] spies I'm going to share just some
[1:59:39] testimonies can I share some testimonies
[1:59:40] we'll close I SP sent some spies over
[1:59:43] into the land people went over there
[1:59:44] come back said oh taste and see it's
[1:59:46] wonderful taste and see that it's really
[1:59:48] good being a
[1:59:50] Christian loving the Lord being married
[1:59:52] is a good
[1:59:53] thing amen it's a good thing the Bible
[1:59:56] says marriage is Honorable contrary to
[1:59:58] what the world says young people listen
[2:00:00] to you marriage is
[2:00:02] Honorable amen why is the devil fighting
[2:00:04] if it was easy everybody'd be doing it
[2:00:06] but nobody's doing it that's why it's
[2:00:08] hard because out of the institution of
[2:00:10] marriage is the only legitimate way to
[2:00:12] bring children into the world right
[2:00:13] that's what the devil is fighting he
[2:00:15] fought it in the beginning God wanted it
[2:00:16] to be the Creator spoken word is
[2:00:18] Original Seed the first one would have
[2:00:19] been Christ brother Ram said it would
[2:00:20] have been the spoken word just like and
[2:00:22] the devil fought the bringing of
[2:00:23] children into the world and the devil
[2:00:25] was fighting your union and your
[2:00:26] marriage and once you realize that you
[2:00:27] realize oh this is just the devil trying
[2:00:29] to get us separated that's why the dword
[2:00:32] should never be used it's until death do
[2:00:35] we part amen for sickness or health
[2:00:38] poverty or riches and we might be in the
[2:00:40] poverty we might be in the bad times but
[2:00:42] God has joined whatsoever God has joined
[2:00:44] us together and God has joined us
[2:00:46] together and I'm not a perfect person my
[2:00:48] wife is pretty much a perfect person but
[2:00:51] God bless but I'm imperfect but she's
[2:00:53] working on me and God's working on and
[2:00:55] God's working on all of us together I
[2:00:58] don't know who that was for but may God
[2:00:59] help
[2:01:00] us I was thinking of just a couple
[2:01:02] things God sent spies over into the land
[2:01:05] I thought about my son Ethan one day we
[2:01:07] were sitting on the porch with my
[2:01:09] friends we were away on vacation with
[2:01:11] some friends and directly my son Ethan
[2:01:13] and one of the boys went riding off and
[2:01:15] directly this boy came back and he was
[2:01:17] running I'm like Hey where's where's
[2:01:20] Ethan he said man the four-wheeler
[2:01:22] flipped over and Ethan's up there and
[2:01:25] he's trapped underneath the four-wheeler
[2:01:26] and I I got out but he's not out I
[2:01:29] remember it well because I was barefoot
[2:01:30] and I'm a Tenderfoot it was a gravel
[2:01:32] road and I ran on the gravel road to try
[2:01:34] to get to my side and I ran up this
[2:01:36] mountain it was running up there and I
[2:01:37] got and directly he come down I like
[2:01:39] Ethan what what he said dad I was laying
[2:01:42] under the four-wheeler and I was about
[2:01:44] to die and somehow I was able to get out
[2:01:47] and I got free and we hugged one another
[2:01:49] cuz our God am man is he's a deliverer
[2:01:52] her you've probably got things in your
[2:01:54] life you could share testimonies I I
[2:01:56] write them in my Bible when the devil
[2:01:57] says look God's not with you I write
[2:01:58] them in my Bible there's a pages in the
[2:02:00] front and the back of it it's not for
[2:02:02] just notes to write the people beside
[2:02:03] you it's to write the Miracles in the
[2:02:04] Supernatural of God I go back and I read
[2:02:07] those things because God is a living
[2:02:12] God
[2:02:14] Jesus that's what the difference is is
[2:02:16] the presence of God that's right you
[2:02:19] take a strong man Moses a ruler he walks
[2:02:22] up and something speaks to him says
[2:02:23] change the order of your dress change
[2:02:25] your shoes take your shoes I'm not doing
[2:02:27] it I was a ruler in Egypt like what made
[2:02:29] the difference the presence of
[2:02:32] God Amen I'm not walking in this room
[2:02:35] and you tell me how to dress I can't
[2:02:36] pierce my body it's the presence of God
[2:02:40] Moses knelt down he took his shoes off
[2:02:43] in that presence Everything Changes amen
[2:02:47] sometimes we've been trying to live by a
[2:02:48] law but if we could come in a presence
[2:02:50] brother the holy spirit and just the
[2:02:53] Bible says be
[2:02:54] still and know that I am God and know
[2:02:58] that God knows everything about you as
[2:03:00] we read last night God go way down your
[2:03:02] life maybe you hit it five years ago and
[2:03:03] God go down in that conversation and
[2:03:05] said no you did that business deal and
[2:03:07] you're wrong and you experience the
[2:03:09] discernment of the power of God that's
[2:03:11] the church I want to be a part of a real
[2:03:13] Church a living church I thought about
[2:03:16] this am I be too long you just give me a
[2:03:18] couple more minutes for some my sons are
[2:03:20] still alive and I'm thank for it today
[2:03:22] but it's the grace of God it would all
[2:03:23] be different without Christ that's right
[2:03:26] so he said with David take not your Holy
[2:03:27] Spirit Lord don't go away from me I
[2:03:30] you're you're all I
[2:03:31] got Jesus Christ is all this church has
[2:03:34] the Holy Spirit it wasn't built on just
[2:03:37] material things but brother Ron and the
[2:03:39] testimony sister Sandy and my son we had
[2:03:42] a muzzle loer somebody gave me a muzzle
[2:03:44] loer a few years later I said Son where
[2:03:47] my muzzle
[2:03:48] Lo anybody know the difference between
[2:03:51] fast burning powder and slow burning
[2:03:52] powder and a muzzle loader and a regular
[2:03:54] so my sons they took uh regular bullets
[2:03:57] and they took and broke the bullets off
[2:03:58] and took the fast burning powder and put
[2:04:00] it in a muzzle loader you don't do that
[2:04:02] do you and so my son he said Dad we took
[2:04:05] the muzzle loer and we broke these
[2:04:06] bullets and stuck it inside of there and
[2:04:08] put something down there he said we held
[2:04:09] it up and we shot it if you know a
[2:04:10] muzzle order they make the diameter of
[2:04:12] the barrel bigger because there's a lot
[2:04:14] of impact uh percussion in it I said
[2:04:17] when he shot it he said dad that Barrel
[2:04:18] peeled back like a banana peel all the
[2:04:20] way back peeled back right to back to
[2:04:22] our hands and and it and then God
[2:04:25] stopped it and it didn't kill my
[2:04:27] sons he's everything to me amen I said
[2:04:31] Jesus Christ is everything he's my
[2:04:33] father he's my mother he's my sister
[2:04:35] he's my brother he's everything when you
[2:04:37] testify of him he comes close to us you
[2:04:40] feel the presence of God man time
[2:04:42] doesn't mean anymore if you got to go
[2:04:44] just feel free to get up I understand
[2:04:45] maybe you got to let your dog out or
[2:04:46] whatever you got to do you got to go but
[2:04:48] Jesus Christ is here today he inhabits
[2:04:51] the es of his people when you talk about
[2:04:53] him he comes close and maybe you got a
[2:04:55] need and you say the doctor's told me
[2:04:56] this or my culture has told me as they
[2:04:58] told Shadrach mesach and AO you will bow
[2:05:02] you will bow to this culture if you want
[2:05:04] a job or you're going to be successful
[2:05:06] you will bow to the image of what we got
[2:05:09] and they said you know what we're not
[2:05:10] bowing to your image we'll give you one
[2:05:12] more chance say look we already read in
[2:05:14] the book over there thou shall not make
[2:05:16] unto thee any graven images so you can
[2:05:17] give me a second or third chance but I
[2:05:19] cannot bow amen to that image God these
[2:05:23] are men brother Robert who only had the
[2:05:25] letter they did not have the Holy Ghost
[2:05:27] all they had was the letter and they
[2:05:29] were just reading the letter what would
[2:05:30] it be today if people had the Holy Ghost
[2:05:33] amen that wrote the word of God and said
[2:05:35] I'll give you the power to live the word
[2:05:37] of God out I'll give you power Jesus
[2:05:40] told him he said you go ter in Jerusalem
[2:05:42] too you be endued with that power that's
[2:05:44] what we need we need to wait until we be
[2:05:46] indued with a power lord I can't live it
[2:05:48] but I've got a power for you Peter it'll
[2:05:50] come inside of you it'll give you power
[2:05:53] to be a witness for me so many people
[2:05:55] are trying to be a witness in life and
[2:05:57] they haven't got the power of the Holy
[2:05:59] Spirit but he's here
[2:06:00] today the holy spirit is searching amen
[2:06:03] he's turning things over in our life he
[2:06:05] may come tomorrow and today he's getting
[2:06:07] us ready amen the bride is making
[2:06:09] herself
[2:06:10] ready I was thinking about a I testified
[2:06:13] I had a growth on my foot and I went to
[2:06:16] I was going to the university I went in
[2:06:18] and there was a man he didn't believe in
[2:06:19] God's healing power and I told him I
[2:06:21] said no I believe
[2:06:22] they shall anoint with oil and pray the
[2:06:23] prayer of faith and God will raise them
[2:06:25] up and when I was doing that the devil
[2:06:26] said yeah but you still have the symptom
[2:06:28] and I did I pushed I remember sitting at
[2:06:29] the table I pushed over like yes the
[2:06:31] pain is so great but my God Is A Healer
[2:06:34] I remember taking my Bible I took the
[2:06:36] Bible I opened it up to Mark 16 to our
[2:06:38] pastor I said it says right there they
[2:06:39] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[2:06:41] shall recover they will anoint with oil
[2:06:43] and pray the prayer you anoint with oil
[2:06:45] and God God
[2:06:47] said God said he would heal me I told
[2:06:50] that man I said believe God is a they
[2:06:52] prayed for me and God is healing me
[2:06:54] right now God is healing me maybe you've
[2:06:57] never come to that place where you draw
[2:06:58] drove a steak down amen you need to
[2:07:00] drive a steak down somewhere and say
[2:07:02] right there Jesus Christ drove a steak
[2:07:04] down one day drove a steak down and he
[2:07:07] hung on the steak it said I'm their
[2:07:09] savior I'm their healer he cried it is
[2:07:10] finished it's finished the steak has
[2:07:12] been driven and all that look to Jesus
[2:07:15] Christ will be saved amen it wasn't a
[2:07:17] few months after that the grow of my
[2:07:18] foot had all dried up and it fell off my
[2:07:20] foot to pre prove that Jesus Christ is
[2:07:22] the same yesterday today and forever and
[2:07:24] if he would do it for me why wouldn't he
[2:07:26] do it for you the Bible says he's no
[2:07:28] respector of person the Bible says
[2:07:30] confess your faults one to another that
[2:07:32] you might be healed if you got sin in
[2:07:34] your life God has no obligation to heal
[2:07:35] you but you confess your sins God I've
[2:07:38] done wrong I've sinned remember the
[2:07:39] prayer cloth letter brother Brandon
[2:07:40] would send it out he said get your
[2:07:42] family together and confess your sins
[2:07:44] yeah Lord I've sinned God forgive me
[2:07:45] Daddy's get your family together say
[2:07:47] Daddy's done wrong he's been lethargic
[2:07:49] but we're rededicating this house to God
[2:07:51] this family is going to be dedicated to
[2:07:53] God I thought about a sister in our
[2:07:55] church she couldn't have
[2:07:56] children I don't know if I've shared
[2:07:58] this testimony I'm going to share maybe
[2:08:00] a couple more and then we'll close she
[2:08:02] couldn't have children she wanted to
[2:08:03] have children and one day she came up
[2:08:05] brother hom longor we anointed her with
[2:08:07] oil and we prayed the prayer of faith
[2:08:08] and just a few months after that she
[2:08:10] conceived and had a child and she was so
[2:08:12] happy she had a baby because God Amen
[2:08:15] just like in Abraham amen he caused the
[2:08:17] child to come and he caused the child
[2:08:18] few years later she wanted to be have
[2:08:20] another child she tried and they
[2:08:21] couldn't have a child same Minister came
[2:08:23] back in town work the first time work
[2:08:27] again you went up I can't have a child I
[2:08:30] Anointed with and pray for her she went
[2:08:31] home conceived a child God's a he he's a
[2:08:35] he's a way maker it's more than a song
[2:08:37] He's a way maker where there is no way
[2:08:40] thank you Lord few years later she had
[2:08:42] another got had a child said I thought I
[2:08:44] had to go up and get prayed
[2:08:46] for be anointed like no God Is A Healer
[2:08:49] he'll heal you blessed be the name name
[2:08:51] of the Lord amen another sister came up
[2:08:53] she had a brace on her back she was in
[2:08:55] so much pain she had fallen down the
[2:08:57] stairs we anointed her with oil and we
[2:08:59] prayed the prayer of face she went back
[2:09:00] she wrote me a long testimony of God I
[2:09:02] don't had she wrote it all out said
[2:09:04] brother Daniel I went back to my seat
[2:09:05] realized I don't have the pain anymore
[2:09:07] she said I went to the back and took the
[2:09:09] brace off and come out and testify God
[2:09:10] healed me he's a he's a Healer am man it
[2:09:13] was a miracle God heals by Miracles God
[2:09:15] heals by Divine Healing but somewhere
[2:09:17] you got to have a place you drive your
[2:09:19] faith down and from that hour he begin
[2:09:21] to a men from that hour God is healing
[2:09:23] me and they testified of those things
[2:09:26] amen I thought about that such a
[2:09:28] powerful thing I remember Sister Sandy
[2:09:30] she she had that her her testimony just
[2:09:32] stays so with me how that she became a
[2:09:34] Christian and her father I hope this is
[2:09:37] not too personal she shared it personal
[2:09:39] she said her father told her I would
[2:09:42] rather you be an immoral person than be
[2:09:46] a
[2:09:48] Christian sister Sandy picked up her
[2:09:50] suitcases
[2:09:52] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[2:09:54] Among Us and she picked up her suitcases
[2:09:57] she walked away from her father I
[2:10:00] believe nine or 10 children that
[2:10:01] brothers and sisters that she was
[2:10:03] Raising and she walked away from them
[2:10:04] with her suitcases because she loved God
[2:10:08] Amen one place it said they love not
[2:10:10] their lives even unto death and now she
[2:10:11] walks away with a broken heart brother R
[2:10:14] because she loves Jesus Christ not just
[2:10:18] Hebrews chapter 13 but if they write
[2:10:19] another book of Acts there'll be a group
[2:10:21] of people's lives will match that amen
[2:10:25] sister Sand's testimony it's so powerful
[2:10:27] God has written another book of Acts and
[2:10:29] she loved her brothers and sisters and
[2:10:30] she went she tells sits across the road
[2:10:33] and sat in the bushes and looked at her
[2:10:34] brothers and sisters weeping in her
[2:10:36] heart that she wants to have fellowship
[2:10:38] with him but she can't because of her
[2:10:41] love for Jesus
[2:10:44] Christ only God help us to fall in love
[2:10:47] with Christ like that if it cost my
[2:10:50] family my friends
[2:10:52] it's more than a song If my mama don't
[2:10:53] go I'm going on my daddy don't go I'm
[2:10:56] going on I'm going on with my Jesus just
[2:10:59] the
[2:11:00] same
[2:11:01] amen thank you can I share your
[2:11:05] testimony brother
[2:11:06] Ron and you all have testimonies these
[2:11:09] are just Miracles that God has done
[2:11:11] brother Ron we've grown to love one
[2:11:13] another he went to Germany worked trying
[2:11:15] to spread this message across to the
[2:11:18] world brother Ron became very sick you
[2:11:20] probably heard the testimony but we'll
[2:11:22] just share it's it's good to see
[2:11:23] testimonies that are
[2:11:25] living and brother G Ron goes there and
[2:11:28] took his family with the brother Amos
[2:11:30] sister Rebecca and brother Matthew amen
[2:11:32] it's not easy you have a family and God
[2:11:35] calls a man and then their family has to
[2:11:37] just be caught in the draft of the
[2:11:39] ministry I went to my sons the other day
[2:11:41] and said I'm sorry that God called me to
[2:11:43] the ministry and it's affected your life
[2:11:46] but I can tell you that God has blessed
[2:11:49] my family because of the sacrifice
[2:11:51] you can't do something for God but what
[2:11:54] God doesn't bless you brother Amos me
[2:11:56] God heals our bodies when we're sick
[2:11:57] sister Becky and here we are today with
[2:11:59] the blessings of God and God has blessed
[2:12:01] brother Matt and his life and the
[2:12:02] challenges way back and now God has
[2:12:04] blessed his life brother Ron he tells
[2:12:06] the testimony how he was sick the doctor
[2:12:09] gave him a year to live and he was six
[2:12:11] months into and he he tells the
[2:12:13] testimony he couldn't even blow a candle
[2:12:15] out you like your birthday candles every
[2:12:17] time you have a birthday and you start
[2:12:18] to blow out think about brother Ron that
[2:12:20] was sick and he couldn't blow the a
[2:12:21] candle
[2:12:22] out said he couldn't walk down the
[2:12:24] street couldn't climb up three steps
[2:12:26] without being winded and he's there and
[2:12:28] he's he has a lung disease and he's
[2:12:30] about to die and he's laying in the
[2:12:32] hospital and he looks up on the counter
[2:12:34] is this okay it's kind of personal but
[2:12:36] hey we have personal testimonies I'm
[2:12:37] sharing his I don't he looks up on the
[2:12:39] calendar and there's a calendar in
[2:12:41] Germany another country different
[2:12:43] language it says this sickness is not
[2:12:45] unto death he takes the calendar I think
[2:12:48] he took it he said can I have that he
[2:12:50] takes the calendar
[2:12:51] and he goes
[2:12:53] back and brother brother brother Ron was
[2:12:57] there to purport the message of brother
[2:12:59] Brandon we believe God sent a prophet in
[2:13:00] the message of this day and so he was
[2:13:02] there to take the sermons to the
[2:13:03] different nations and he prayed this
[2:13:05] prayer he says I I've written it down
[2:13:08] from seven years ago he said Lord Jesus
[2:13:10] if you were here I would go to you and
[2:13:11] you would lay your hands on me and I
[2:13:13] would be healed if your Prophet was here
[2:13:16] I would go to him and he would lay his
[2:13:17] hands on me he was healed I would be
[2:13:19] healed he said but he's not here here
[2:13:21] and the closest thing that I have to the
[2:13:23] message of the hour that's coming our
[2:13:24] day is the tapes and brother Ron gives a
[2:13:27] testimony he affirmed it the other day
[2:13:29] he said I took those tapes and laid them
[2:13:30] out in the shape of a
[2:13:33] cross like that cross on the floor he
[2:13:35] said I laid them out in the shape of the
[2:13:36] Cross sister San is here to testify he
[2:13:38] said I got down and I laid on that cross
[2:13:41] of those tapes and God healed
[2:13:44] him God raised him up he's sitting here
[2:13:47] as a testimony I believe it was a week

[2:13:51] believe Amos you might have been with
[2:13:52] him he said he climbed that that
[2:13:54] mountain because God Is A Healer he
[2:13:55] wouldn't be sitting here today if it
