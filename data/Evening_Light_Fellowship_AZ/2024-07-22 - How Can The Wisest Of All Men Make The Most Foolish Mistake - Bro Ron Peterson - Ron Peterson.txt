to school praise the Lord are you happy to be a Christian amen amen amen what would you do without him I tell you there's nothing like him now you know I've had some things in my heart that I've wanted to preach and I was I was in the room the other day there in the conference room and I was counseling with a couple and I had mentioned some things that I had questioned throughout the scriptures and I thought you know I've always wanted to to preach on this and just like I'd always wanted to preach on the thief on the cross well today I'm going to have another Milestone where I'm going to preach on one of the things I've thought about um much of my Christian Life and uh so I'm going to be preaching on Solomon Solomon and so anyway if you just remain standing and let's turn to our Bibles how does our Pulpit look H does it look good is it fit me okay just right thank you it's I think it's a masterpiece First Kings chapter 3 we're going to be doing a lot of reading here first Kings chapter 3 and we'll go through 1- 15 and Solomon made Affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the Lord than the wall of Jerusalem round about only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord until those days and Solomon loved the Lord walking in the statutes of David his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places may God add the blessing to his word you may be seeded because we're reading quite a bit I want you to just follow along with me now notice the first verse there Solomon had an affinity with Pharaoh we're going to be looking at this this is showing even at the very beginning of his reign as king there's a margin of eror and it's going to start and it's going to continue until it consumes and this is one of the questions that I have had as a young man how is it that the wisest of all men will make the most foolish ofs think about this thought now as we continue reading reading and the King went to gibian to sacrifice there for that was the great high place and a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon the altar in gibian the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night so now God's going to be dealing with Solomon and he's going to appear to him twice this is the first time in gibian and God said ask what I shall give thee and Solomon said thou Hast shown showed unto thy servant David my father great Mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou Hast kept him this great for him this great kindness that thou Hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is in this day and now oh Lord my God thou Hast made thy servant King instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out or come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou Hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this so great a people and the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing and God said unto him because thou H has asked this thing and H has not asked for thy self long life neither hast thou asked for riches thyself nor has asked the life of thine enemies but has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold I have done according to thy words lo I have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee and neither after thee shall any wise any arise like unto thee I have also given thee that which thou Hast not asked both riches and honor so there shall not be any among the Kings like unto thee all thy days here's the catch and if thou W walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my Commandments as thy father David did walk then I will lengthen thy days and Solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants now turn with me back to First Kings 10 First Kings chapter 10 verses 23- 29 but if you remember much of the time there is a reference of the wisdom of Solomon and of a woman named uh the Queen of Sheba how that she comes to him and you see that in the first part of the chapter I'm not reading those scriptures but you can see it in in first King Kings 10 verse1 but we're going to drop down now to verse 23 so King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the Earth for riches and for wisdom and all the Earth sought to sought to Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments and armor and spices and horses and mules aate year by year and Solomon gathered together chariots and Horsemen and he had 1,400 chariots 12,000 Horsemen to whom bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at Jerusalem and the King made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones and Cedars made to be as sycamore trees that are in the veil for abundance and Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt and linen yarn the king's Merchants received received the linen yarn at a price and a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a horse for 150 for and for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria did they bring them out by their means may God add the blessing to the reading of his word this morning and I pray that God will help me to deliver this thought that I've had on my heart and wed for some time because when you have a question within the scripture there is a Bible answer and so I'm titling my sermon how can the wisest of all men make the most foolish of ears how does he make this mistake and so I'm taking as a subject this morning having an affinity with pharaoh and so when you look at this he's got an affinity with Pharaoh takes his daughter I looked up the word Affinity I don't know if I sent it to the brother yes Hebrew cam to give a daughter away in marriage hence generally to make a contract Affinity by marriage now the Bible does not tell us that Pharaoh's daughter is a convert doesn't say she is a proelite right and I want you to know that it was forbidden for Israelites to marry Heathen women I want to ask you the question how can the wisest of men with wisdom of God make such a foolish air and it's hidden within the scriptures and this pattern repeats itself all through the scriptures so you take this thought this Affinity he's got this contract there and why was this Affinity with Pharaoh why would you have this and we see that there were reasons behind his desire to have this woman and most of it was all political in fact it is a historical fact among the Jews that Solomon never married a woman from Israel of over 700 of his wives and 300 concubine thousand women not one was from Israel this is a little hard to Fathom I thought you said he's a smartest guy in the world yeah but see he had this Affinity with pharaoh he had this connection he had noticed the lifestyle they kind of lean this direction and the Bible says the way a tree leans so shall it fall so we see already at the very beginning of the reign of Solomon who I want to take you back is one of the four sons of David through basba the first one you know died and we know that two other sons of David also who thought they would be air to the throne both of them sought the throne illegally and one of uh Solomon's Brothers son of David came to basheba and said would you please give me abishag to Mary that remember abishag uh was the the the female that was given to King David to keep him warm in his old age you remember that Solomon catches what is going on there's a plot going on behind it and when BBA asks this for Solomon's brother he said well why don't we give him the throne also and what does he do he kills his brother has him killed so I want you to understand that there is a element of a and yet he's an elect Son of God God's watching over him but even Great Men great men with great wisdom make foolish airs and yet I want to make this disclaimer to all of you right now Solomon will be there he's going to be in heaven but we're going to see through the scriptures that this little issue that he had at the beginning of his Reign actually consumes him in his old age have any of you read it in your Bible have you seen the heir of Solomon and yet the question is there in my mind hey wait a second with all of your getting get understanding so I wish to just rehearse this in your mind this morning and this Affinity that he has will actually come to a full manifestation in the latter years of his life understand that Solomon as a young man loves the Lord it says he loves the Lord and in his youth he's doing an awful and how long does the uh reign of Solomon lasts 40 years so the from the time of his Youth and he loves the Lord but there is a little issue that is there that is perhaps unnoticed it is overlooked by many and when you see that if you overlook keeping all of God's commandment it's going to come back to bite you amen man shall not live by bread alone but by somebody say it out loud every word of God therefore we can't change it one jot or one TT that's right and we look at the um this as that he wanted political favor in fact all of the 700 women that he marries are from the the Nations and countries and the reigning um Pagan Heathen countries around there that's why there was 40 Years of no war it was almost a fake Millennium 40 years well why I'll marry your daughter you don't attack I'll marry your daughter don't attack okay so now he's politically minded he's got the all of these women and and and we're going to be looking at this and dissecting it down and Solon was one of the greatest Kings of Israel there is no doubt he was h of the physical lineage of David now Solomon loved the Lord and yet he had an affinity towards pharaoh and so it's going to show in a weak spot a place let's call it his Achilles heel this is an issue that is never really truly dealt with and will be the demise of Solomon and the destruction of Israel and actually God says I'm going to Ren the Kingdom from you yes so how can this happen with all of this wisdom and understanding how could he missed such an important detail and make such a terrible mistake let me just rehearse something to all of you and you young people listen to this God under no circumstances wants you to go and marry an unbeliever you understand that he said under no condition and yet it happens go out here and marry some nice looking girl cuz you fell for her beauty instead of her character God does not want us unequally yolked did you know that one of the signs of the end time is going to be the increase of the beauty of women somebody say Amen some of you sisters are horribly cursed with that you're too pretty you are and it's going to be an issue to you and remember the god of America is a woman well I'm just I'm going slow because I want you to understand I'm going screw it down clinch the nail in fact Steven McNeely said brother Ron you take your time and he said you finish all your notes I said thank you so is that okay brother Steve can I do it all right buddy God all right so I want to ask you what caused the end of the lovian destruction the Bible gives us an answer in Genesis 6: 1 and 2 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born un them here comes women again can't live with them we can't live without them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men were fair and took unto them wives of all which they chose and God never did forgive them they chose Beauty over virtue I want to ask ask what was wrong with the women from Israel that the sons of God would look at the daughters of man why would you look outside this message for a a wife where are you going to find a virtuous woman on a dating website how about LA Fitness huh how about a sporting event maybe she's a cheerleader for Dallas Cowboys woo maybe we're going to H come on now and I'm on the case of our young men how dare you look outside this message then you wind up do you find some beautiful girl and you marry her and just if you years later the beauty starts to vanish and next thing you know she's not a mother to your kids and you wind up what's the problem next thing you know you got a mess on your hands because you went into it wrong amen you better marry somebody that believes like you and better has the Holy Ghost even doctrinally thinking the same as you lest amen your sons marry their daughters vice versa and they take you away amen I'm going to show you in scriptures look at the warning that God give Israel through the teaching of Moses remember David was was pure in all his heart David make mistakes but you know what when he makes mistake and gets rebuked of God he is a man after God's Own Heart and when he took bash Sheba and it was wrong guess what he's going to pay for it but he repents quickly why his heart was right before God so there's a difference between David and Solomon because we're going to find out that David's heart was pure before God but not Solomon Solomon gave God his head but not his heart gave that to his wives Samson gave his heart to Delilah and his power to God and yet Samson's going to be there oh the Bible is filled with Mysteries and with different things that make us Wonder oh how did they get there how could this be how could it happen how could the wisest of all men on the Earth make a most foolish mistake it is found in Exodus 34 if you wish to turn in your Bibles also the Bible says take heed to thyself in other words I'm giving you a warning take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the in habitants of the land wherewith thou goest so remember there's an exodus out of Egypt and guess what they go into Canaan and in the land is filled with Hittites and jebusites and parasites right all kinds of big and powerful Nations lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee so take heed when you go but you shall destroy their all Alters break their images and cut down their Groves for Thou shalt worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous is a jealous God Amen lest thou make a covenant an affinity make some kind of contract with the inhabitants of the land of this land and they go whing after their gods look at Spirit ual adultery what does he call it they go a whing after these false gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou shalt eat of his sacrifice did you know it's forbidden to eat sacri sacrifices offered to odol yeah and thou take of their daughters under thy sons and their daughters go whing after their gods and make their sons go horing after their gods Thou shalt make thee no molten Gods let me show you another example because we find it also in Deuteronomy chapter 7 verses 3-8 neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter shalt not give unto thy son nor his daughters shalt thou take unto thy son amen for they will turn away thy son from following me amen amen oh it's okay they she's from a good church trinitarian father son Holy Ghost they're good people I've been to their Church man I tell you those people they they're lovely people is there anything wrong with the people in fact some of them probably a whole lot nicer than we are yeah for they'll turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods right so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you and destroy the suddenly because remember listen serve me and I will watch over you all the days of your life but go a whoring and I'm going to come on now he's the same yesterday today and forever but they shall deal with them ye shall destroy their altars break down their images cut down their Groves burn their graven images with fire and not even look at their website that's a paraphrase version here for thou art look at predestination unto election but thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the Earth let me tell you people you are special to God amen amen the Lord God did not set his love upon you nor chose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord God loved you and because he would keep the oath what he had sworn unto their your fathers hath the Lord brought you out of a with a mighty hand redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt now here's something he he bought you out from the hand of pharaoh and here the wisest of men has an affinity go figure with Pharaoh now brother Brenham picks this up because it takes a spiritual man to begin to see air in its infancy yes you understand in its infancy prophet of God said watch this rock and roll this music today with Elvis Presley Elvis Presley is tame compared to the filth and the nonsense of today Ricky Nelson all of these guys and the Beatles he said brother brandham said they weren't even in God's thinking takes a spiritual man begins to see something in its infancy form Watchmen what of the night you're on the tower you can see above I see brother Bram said watch you watch over your children you watch where they go what they look at what they listen to cuz I'm telling you if they don't get the Holy Ghost he says this modern day rock and roll music it'll catch them amen Watchman what of the night I want to show you here's brother Brenham now in 1955 I've never studied what brother Brenham says about Solomon now now the vast majority of quotes that you're going to find that he refers to Solomon you're going to find out that he talks about the wisdom of solom the Queen of Sheba you're going to find it about Jonah who is in the belly of the whale and remembers the prayer of Solomon that if thou will turn thy face toward the holy city you'll get delivered right from the lying vanities am the vast majority of those quotes are going to refer to those things the Queen of Sheba and how she come and everything and what I want to probably launch off into and I'm ahead of myself right now but brother Brenham preaches a sermon called there's a greater thank God for a greater than Solomon is here so brother Brenham says in separation from unbelief 1955 here in Phoenix do you know the wisest man in the Bible outside of Christ died an idolator because of a bunch of pretty women Solomon pull him away from God all right don't yoke yourself up unequally he had an affinity with pharaoh and he took his daughter unequally yolked the prophet of God said what started in its infancy ends in a Devastation and the rening of the Kingdom from Solomon why little Beth Bethlehem 1962 well now the same thing is paralleled here again David's natural seed was Solomon and it backslid just like the other did of Abraham did it backslid so did Solomon backslide he got too many women and the first thing you know they LED his heart away from God and the way he went and backslid died that way backslid Israel died in the same way backslid now let me say this before we go further I do believe he's going to make it in heaven I believe we will see Solomon but it's a paradox to me that the man with the greatest his wisdom would make such a terrible mistake now brother Brandon preaches a sermon called lean not to your own understanding how many know that the way of a man is right in his own eyes so would it not be true for even the wisest of all men he was right in his own eyes Okay so follow along with me lean not to your own understanding we have made denominations and schools and buildings and failed to do what Jesus told us to do was preach the gospel we've tried to educate the world he never said educate the world he's that's educated shall be saved you got to be born again filled with the Holy Spirit that's the reason we have so miserably failed everywhere see we got the wealth and we got the thing now what will happen so he's going to tell you future events we're not preaching the gospel we got wealth we got these things now what will happen and when this church World Council of churches goes together can't you see who's going to do the leading can't you methodists Presbyterians understand that the rest of you even you Pentecostal you say you're not going in well either go you'll either go in or you'll bust up the denomination you do one or the other it's right before you got to do it it's a forcing the mark of the beast here's a prophet we had a glitch some of you had a hard time making connections and everything and Home Depot was shut down and Banks were shut down and everything over some kind of a little computer glitch that's just a forerunner that's just a little glitch a little little speed bump in the roll wait until all of this stuff comes together in the mark of the beast and you won't be able to buy or sell you think that this thing is harmless I want to ask you which one of you willfully fellowships with the Harlot system which one of you wants to embrace Jezebel and her adulterous ways and bring her daughters huh well but there's such denominationalism absolutely I can prove it by the Bible is the mark of the beast she was a and had prostitute daughters and we know that that is the truth organized religion that's why brother RM said I'm against organized religion now think about this in the message we know we don't have any quote denominations but we got organizations yeah we are organizing among ourselves and we believe this and we believe that and it's us four and you no more right let's look at it face value amen it's contrary to the word and it's Antichrist and its principles not everything in there is Antichrist but in its principles it's a Sy the system it's Antichrist because it's against the word of God every organized system is that way I want to ask you what Affinity do you have with Pharaoh what Affinity do you have this world because the scripture says if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not even in you oh now come on brother Ron it they really no come on brother Ram said I'm not against the people there's good people he said it's a system and there's a spirit behind it are we aware of that he says that's why I'm against organized religion why we are not a denomination Amen in the sermon or it's Church age book pergam and church age so balum got Israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication put the quote up here man we need to stay with me there we go no yeah I want the the one on the on the pergan church age so balam got Israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication it's the very same spirit that lies in organized religion okay maybe we're missing it I said that the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization it's a spirit so you hang around somebody with a wrong Spirit you wonder why you get some kind of adulterous fornicating love the world and the things of the world Spirit on you M it was the Affinity that Solomon had with Pharaoh that started out looked so innocent he all he did was marry his daughter yeah well let me see who you choose and I'll tell you what kind of reflection you got in you it doesn't look like the reflection at first until he gets older and this thing goes from its infancy until now it goes into fullblown okay well look at it you see Solomon with all his wisdom how can you do it and make such a mistake you might be a great leader build yourself a a a a a kingdom you might be blessed just like Solomon was you might be the most famous preacher in the message on the internet you might be popular and get all the likes and subscribe and all this and hey wow I want to ask the thing brother Bren said there's three things that'll take a man down what are they money women and popularity Solomon's got all three so it only took a period of 40 years for this to come from its infancy form to take a full manifestation of how far he got off and I you know what Marvels me is how did the people of Israel allow it uh uh let me tell you this is mere speculation because hidden behind all of the wealth the wealth opulence and popularity nobody's going to criticize Solomon man look at that church look at the people look at the Chariots the horsemen my goodness God has blessed him he is doing so well thousands and horses and oh my look at this some people are so blinded because of big opulence and Wealthy sometimes I wonder if we wouldn't be better in a swept out barroom sitting on a 2x4 like they do in Africa not a nice padded chair with a lumbar support but a 2x4 in the heat no air conditioning walks 78 hours to get to the service then they get upset with you because you only preach an hour you got to be kidding me I walk seven hours to get here I don't want to I don't want a sandwich I don't want an appetizer you give me a seven course meal amen you understand sometimes I think we lose our blessing CU we got too much Lord help us amen I'm not here to build a kingdom I want to ask how could this happen now watch here Ephesian Church AG you you can show this quote now because you just had it see how it started out in the early church it was called Deeds then became a Doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way it finally took over God was pushed aside oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looks so good it seems so sound then it caught a hold and like a python squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in it oh that false Vine is subtle it's like an angel of Light till he gets a hold of you and I want to say that I believe in leadership it's not the leadership of men I believe in qualify that brother brandom you believe in leadership but don't believe in leadership of man watch what he say I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I believe also that God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they'll keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge but but that rule is by the word amen so that it's not the man really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and the spirit are one then he quotes Hebrews 12 13:7 again how in the world through all of this wisdom and all that he had does Solomon make this mistake Nehemiah picks it up these answers are found in your Bible Nehemiah picks it up in chapter 13: 26 and 27 did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things yet among many nations was there no King like him who was beloved of his God and made and God made him King over all Israel nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives Nehemiah picks it up do you know that the most controversial issue within the message right now marriage and divorce you know why because it deals with the original sin did not Solomon king of Israel sin after these things your Bible does not sit there and just cover it over shows you there's answers in the Bible women always signify churches is that right let me just throw something out there is it possible that some of our ministers get all kinds of strange wives to following them and they have this great following on YouTube or whatever and it shows oh you know what I'm I'm going to be honest with you I'm the pastor of one wife I've had people say well brother Ron go ahead and there there's people over here why don't you go get this little ch church we'll get them and you can Pastor them and you can Pastor another one over here and you can Pastor over here and I'm the pastor of six or eight churches no I'm the husband of one wife that's you guys I'm not interested even though there's many people around the world and they're listening right now they stream our services but I'm not interested in being their husband spiritually speaking I am here to tell you because I am zealous over you with a Godly jealousy I don't want nobody flirting with my why you understand amen you know what's not very nice is when you go out to dinner with somebody and the brother wants to talk to your wife the whole time instead of talking to you and I I said hey I invited you not my wife oh but yeah sister oh yeah oh you know hey wait wait just a second you and I the brother that brought me to the message came to visit us when we were in flagst we lived in a little house I came home and guess what he's there with his wife and he got several kids this is the brother who brought me to the message and I come come into the house and my wife's crying I said Sandy what's the matter oh that brother he's been talking to me yeah well he said this and he said that so I went over to him I said hey I said you know what listen you're here in my home you brought me to this message but I says you want to talk to my wife you do it through me I want to be there yeah what are you so spiritual I think you're just like an alter boy okay I says he says that's not even scripture I said oh yes it is I said Jesus when he talked to the woman at the well yeah well look that's what he did he talked to her alone the woman at the well but he said also go get your come on now you know your Bible go get your husband I don't have a husband yeah you've had five and the one you're living with now ain't your husband you see his spiritual headship I told said you know I love you you're my brother in Christ but you don't mess with my wife amen I tell you what brothers your wives will love you a whole lot more if you're a little bit zealous over them and just ain't letting anybody and everybody okay somebody say praise the Lord I love him now during the time of Mah the prophet there was an also an issue that came up so turn with me in 2 Chronicles 18 verses 1- 177 and you're going to see or 1-7 and Jehosaphat how many remember Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance and joined Affinity oh wait a second here's that word again had Affinity with Ahab my so guess what they do and after after certain years he went down to Ahab in Samaria and Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance oh let me tell you just hold a feast have a church Gathering and burn the burgers and the buns and all that and let me tell you everybody comes they won't come to church but they'll come to the little Feast so they you know anyway the people that had he had with him and persuaded him to go up with with him to rth Gilead any of you know what happened at REM rth Gilead so now they go to rth Gilead and have king of Israel said unto joset king of Judah Willl thou go with me to rth Gilead and he answered him I am as Thou Art and my people as thy people and we will be with you with thee in the war and jeap spat said to the king of Israel inquire I pray thee at the Lord at the word of the Lord today therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets 400 men and said to them shall we go up to rth Gilead to battle or shall I forbear and they said go up for God will deliver it into the king's hand here's 400 message preachers following after one saying shall we go go on the praise God yes sir Rond Gilead that's ours it was taken by the enemy it's ours let's go after it there's 400 of them I want to ask you what made Jehoshaphat say this next sentence is there not a prophet of the Lord besides that we might inquire of him yeah wish you hadn't asked right the king of Israel said you yeah there's yet One Man by whom we may inquire of the Lord but I hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but always evil always on my case better be careful that guys that's sweet and nice and sweet talking you all the time yeah you got one more guy what's his name micaya bring him here remember zedekiah took the horns yes I tell you what watch this probably the best speaker in the the whole congregation or the whole convention look zedekiah what about you yeah yeah look we're going to break the Yol we're going to go in here and we're going to take it and everybody yeah amen amen what about you m he said you'll not go up I see Israel scattered like sheep see I told you I I hate that guy he says go put him in prison and when I get back he said if you get back because he said if you come back God not ever even spoke to me oh I want to ask you saints of God where are the micas within the message right now that are not trying to follow all of the preachers in all of their certain ways isn't there somebody that is going to be his own man isn't there somebody don't is there somebody somewhere within the message that follows God in God's word oh God give us a Mah again not 400 message preachers yeah yeah man excuse me in the sermon God keeps his word in Jeffersonville he had a motive behind it see now what we're all here and having such a big time will you go up to Routh Gilead with me to battle because actually Syria has it up there and ramoth Gilead belongs to me it's rightful we have the right we're the first church we have the right you see it then Jehosaphat said well now being that we're having a good time and my men is like your men why we're all believers anyhow so let's just associate together he made a vital mistake he did and jehos bat being spiritual enough as I believe with all my heart that was a type of this day surely somewhere somehow God God will get the message to the True Heart amen Solomon gave God his head but not his heart so many scriptures say in Solomon God spoke to him thou has not walked in thy heart pure like thy father David oh my goodness he said in the beginning he would so he's got the problem lined up see sure I'll go up with you but he said wait wait a minute I before we go we ought to ask the Lord don't you think so if we're all believers why don't we ask the Lord I think that's a good thing you know before you make any kind of decision why don't you ask God amen amen get on your knees ask God God what what do you say about this now brother Brenham refers to Solomon so much of the time I quote it many times in a marriage ceremony now here's the wisest of all men and he's about to give you some real wisdom and sisters listen up to this here's the wisest of all men giving you Godly advice I hope every young man here when he gets married he'll get uh he'll get a wife and you'll have a happy together his wife and I have 22 years that that we've been married he who has found a wife he's found a good thing as Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown an unrighteous one is water in his blood and his blood stream is his life so an unrighteous one is the wrong thing he can get a hold of and the righteous one's the best thing he can get a hold of outside his salvation is that right amen amen come on all of you amen amen yeah see the women when I kind of get to cutting the other night with the scripture on these Pentecostal women the way they're dressing wearing their hair going on you say you don't make any difference that excuse me that doesn't make any difference sure does oh brother Ron what's wrong with us Tri in her hair a little bit brother Brenan was asked the question what would cause a woman to trim her hair he said an UNL ungodly Spirit of the devil cause a woman to trim her in fact the scripture says if a woman cuts her hair let her be sh you can look just like me and brother Paul yeah because if you cut it you might as well be sh that's what the Bible says because if you cut your hair you dishonor your head and brother Brenham said in many quotes and you know this he says why a dishonorable woman you can divorce her and put her away cuz she cut her hair why he takes it to the fact because the head of every man is Christ yes and the head of Christ is God Amen so when she trims her hair what kind of spirit is that that's okay come on brother Ron little split ends and guess what I remember I think we were in Canada when some of the sister said we don't trim our hair we burn it yeah they they would take a match and so they didn't cut their hair my brother my sister and you know what listen uh up there in Canada where we were at we we had horrible water and most of the women had hair to about their shoulder length and they'd grown it for years and years because their hair was so unhealthy my and I said well let's pray I said and God will give you along there we had to drive I think it was 10 or 12 miles till G go get water from a well to be able that Sandy and my daughter could wash their hair in well water instead of the water from the city brother Ram says and hear ye him because we're talking about spirits right part of it demonology how in the world could this little demon spirit get past the wisdom of Solomon God gave him this wisdom yeah but remember man is right in his own eyes so now he's going to justify this but watch here and hear ye him in Middletown Ohio and now to you Holiness people Pentecostal Free Methodist nazarenes Pilgrim Holiness I remember the time when it was wrong for a woman to cut her hair what happened do you know the Bible gives a man a right to divorce from his uh to get a divorce from his wife when she cuts her hair the Bible said that a woman that cuts her hair dishonors her head that's truth and you get out here with these little old dirty nasty filthy clothes on called shorts mow the grass in the backyard and call yourself a Christian how must the Holy Spirit feel before the father when he has to bring that up oh you say I don't wear shorts brother brand I wear where slacks that's worse you know that's the truth the Bible said that a woman will put on a garment pertains to a man's abomination in the sight of the Lord sight of him that's right that's the scripture amen what about a man putting on a garment pertaining to a woman yeah CU we always get on the women what about the men you put on these shorts he said that's women's underwear then you get out here and you put it on your Instagram and you sitting there with a bunch of you Jezebel's you ain't converted you got a spirit on you all right not the holy spirit it's the unclean spirit it's Jezebel you understand that's why you can fellowship with the Harlot system and it don't convict you let me tell you take a holy ghost filled Christian and put it ACH uh put him amongst a bunch of unbelievers and guess what you will either convict their lives and they won't even like you being around or you'll become one of them oh I don't see it so bad especially that pretty girl yeah she kind of likes me man never had a girl in the message like me but this one o la what kind of spirit would cause a man to wear shorts hanging around immoral people it's a spirit yeah I'm going slow not a lot of amening and stuff in the sermon the voice of the sign watch this remember there was a group one time great man named Ahab he got 400 Israeli prophets now that wasn't Heathen Prophets 400 Israelite prophets there was a Godly Man by name of Jehoshaphat who was king of Judah and he come down and there was and there's where a Believer got mixed up with an unbeliever see and then things went wrong we say we all are we all still believing the message see what he said brother on say what's yeah I'm saying it I'm not adding to I'm just saying what he said he saith rth Gilead now watch this how true it can be said rth Gilead belongs to us up there up in the part of the country up there that's ours Joshua in dividing up the lands give it to Israel and the Philistines heathens come over and took it away from them he said that belongs to us now watch how fundamentally people can be right and yet miss it takes a prophet to see these things fundamentally right it's ours belongs to us and miss it watch the thing actually did belong to Israel but all of God's promises brother is on condition see if they walk before the Lord see that condition fundamentally right and yet miss it how could Solomon miss it Behold a greater than Solomon is here if Jonah under those circumstances could believe a prayer that was made by a man that later backslid because of women as Solomon wow you see until you go to studying this you kind of pass over all this stuff about Solomon now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of Israel the priest oh we got to go to the scripture I'm sorry go to Ezra chapter 9 Ezra how many of you like Ezra Ezra I don't know if he was an engineer or not I think he was he helped build walls and all that stuff now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their Abominations even of the Canaanites the Mi the mittit the perizzites and jebusites and ammonites and moabites and Egyptians and amorites and they have taken their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed mingled themselves with the people of those lands yay the hand of the P the hand of the princes and rulers hath been Chief in this trespass who was the worst leaders Ezra caught it man he said even the priests and the Levites they're the worst in the sermon marriage and divorce 1965 Brothers s now what about today what's the god of the United States what's the god of the United States you remember in the Tabernacle years ago I preached on that the God of this modern day a little flapper sitting up there with makeup on dress pulled up over her knees things like that said behold your God that's right she's on every advertisement half naked it's an instrument of Satan from the beginning Jesus saw says see we see that it's so now in from the beginning and that's what he's talking about see the heathens used to make her a god did you know that a goddess the heathens made her a God made her a goddess sure did they make her a goddess for they did have sex acts in their worship do we have that quote come on man did I mess it up and not give you the the quotes because th this is what he said he said they had sex acts in their worship service my they make her a god they did had sex acts see they claim that she was the creator in her womb she carried the seed and created it's a lie there's only one Creator and that's God but you remember Paul there Diana of Ephesus image of a rock and the goddess of Heaven throw down don't you see how Heathen worship is we know nothing and we not knowing it turn right straight back to the Heathen worship again to women the very lowest creature on earth and women worship she will sway any man the way she wants to and not knowing all that beauty on the outside that is Hell on the inside Solomon said her Gates is the gates To Hell how many know the beauty is deceitful nothing but vanity they say billions of dollars every year is made on makeup and things so that you can stay young wrinkle cream um it's everywhere it's a Mega billion doll business men and women dye their hair because it turns gray brother Bram said now look I got no scripture about you dying your hair but I ask you sisters why can't we age gracefully well I started getting gray my mother started turning gray when she was 18 and she had this streak like Tulsa gabard and everybody come up to my mother it looks so beautiful well I understand maybe if you're 15 and you're turning gray you might want to dye your hair okay because you got to try to impress somebody and when you snag the guy and you got him go ahead and let it turn gray I got to let you laugh a little bit now I I remember brother Mario and God bless you you for your gray hair because and and the reason I say this is one of the first time I was in the Philippine I had a ministers meeting right and all the brothers were there and there was not one gray-haired man there and some of them were older than me I said wow what do you guys eat this is amazing most of them not only had a head full of hair but it was dark then they all started laughing we di it you you what I thought about dying my hair one time just come to the pit see if it makes me look younger some of you I know would laugh no and and sisters look I'm not on your case I'm just saying I think it does look a little poor when a woman is so old and her hair is jet black like who you trying who you trying to kid I remember when I I met and I never met Billy Graham but I met Oral Roberts so Robert McGary and I went and met Oral Roberts and I'd never met him I even shook his hand so it's amazing but or Roberts his hair was jet black on top and he had gray sideburns and you could see he jet blacked his eyebrows too it looks so cheap I thought why not let it go Gray who you trying wh why vanity who cares why don't we age with Grace let me tell you all you sisters over about 25 guess what everything 25 30 40 maybe 50 I mean you know cuz some of you what what yeah let me tell you you brother Bram said after you hit about 2025 you're feeding your body the same food you're doing the same things and you're you're starting to die yeah all of us we're dying except for you younger ones praise the Lord you're still young yeah young guy yeah yeah but when you hit 25 guess what you go pump that iron yeah guess what you ain't going to become Arnold Schwarzenegger unless you take steroids yeah what goods all this muscle bodily exercise profit this a little well some of you need a little help I admit that if you do push aways more than pull-ups you'd be all right push away from the table Moses had a remedy from the word for the issue for Solomon Deuteronomy 12 veres 2 through four and ye shall utterly destroy all the places whereupon the Nations which ye shall possess serve their gods upon the high mountains upon the hills and under every Green Tree and ye shall overthrow their altars break their pillars burn their Groves with fire and you shall heue down the Grave images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of the place you shall not do so unto the Lord your God now in close Here's the Clincher so let's nail it down and clinch the nail in First Kings chapter 11 and King Solomon loved many strange women why does it call them strange women Why didn't it just say many women I mean when you you know so I thought hey what does the word strange what is it strange women are they I don't think he would have loved them honest with you yeah I want her that strange one over there the strange in Scripture it comes from he Hebrew no which means adulterous means different means means outlandish these strange outlandish adulterous women he loved them and together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites Zid zidonians and Hittites and the Nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel you shall not go in unto them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods Solomon clave unto these in love and he had 700 wives princesses and 300 concubines and his wives turned away his heart what ever you have an affinity for his wives turned away his heart for it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart from after their gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David see do you see the head versus heart Solomon went after ashtra the goddess of of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites and Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord and went not fully after the Lord as did David his father then did Solomon build an high place for Kos the abomination of Moab in the hill that was before Jerusalem and for MCH the abomination of the children of Ammon and likewise did he for all strange wives which burnt incest and S incense and sacrificed under their gods the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared to him twice God Appears to him twice God said because you didn't ask for yourself I'm going to give you wisdom because you didn't ask for money I'm going to give you some money there's nothing wrong with money as long as it's kept in the right channel the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which appeared unto him twice and commanded him concerning this thing God command God appeared to him twice and commanded him that he should not go after other gods that he kept not that which the Lord God commanded My My My Strange great lesson to be learned here isn't I've never heard a minister in the message preach on Solomon or his Heir I've never looked those quotes up brother brm said he died backslid and caused Israel to backslide and then God says because you have done this I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to raise up two adversaries and I'm going to Ren the Kingdom from you and guess what they're going to be part of your family so God raises up said okay Solomon I'm going to keep one part because of David the rest go read the rest of First Kings 11 it's sobering it's very sobering and yet he's the same yesterday today and forever wow could it be that we have within the message that we have some that let me tell you the way that they can put it together in their wisdom and my my just so popular with the people and yet out here and claiming to have all these wives could it be happening again today I'm just asking you you judge it yourself I had a brother musicians if you come I had a brother that he believed in being a pastor of many churches he said that way brother Ron you just have a church here Church there and you can live off the money they send you I told him I said I don't believe in that I said I believe in being the pastor of one wife husband of one why and everything and but everywhere he went that's what he did he'd start a church and he get them and they'd be under him next thing you know they got all these churches and he's the he's the pastor of all these churches so all these churches send him money but where do you end up I wonder if they're strange because the Bible says they go from house to house leading what kind of women silly women and now you don't even have to go house to house all you got to do is they click on it comes right into your living room comes right to where you're at lead silly women Laden away with divers lust you understand that's why oh God here's where I I don't know that this will be my next sermon but I want to launch off this right now and just to say we need a greater than Solomon that's why he said the greater than Solomon is here now because Solomon backslid he went away because of strange women but there's one now that is so faithful it's the Holy Spirit he will lead you and guide you into all truth amen God bless you thank you for coming today thank you for listening sitting intently and yes I can get a little rough on these things but I'm showing you it's Spirits it's Spirits because you remember we were talking about how that try the spirits of them that say that they are Apostles and are not found them to be Liars because we've got to have discernment of spirit [Music] [Music] now because I don't like leaving on a particularly let's say low note I want to say but at the end of the road and after everything is said and done guess what Solomon will be [Music] there he cannot forget his own yeah God was upset with him yeah God took the Kingdom from him but how many of you are going to shake your fist at him and say what a foolish mistake you know [Music] what it's him Saints through all of this that we go through through the tangents through the ups and downs through the faults and failures guess what it was him so even though Solomon had done such a terrible mistake I believe one day when we get over there I'm not saying [Music] bride but I'm saying salvation over there one of them [Music] yes never never put a period on somebody if they make a mistake and say well he did this so I'll tell you what he's [Music] out even as Saul the Bible says and Saul became an enemy to God remember he goes to the witch of Endor I've told you this many times and the witch calls up Samuel Samuel he says wherefore hast thou called me up seeing thou has become an enemy to [Music] God amazing thing he said God's going to take your life from you he [Music] said but tomorrow you'll be with me figure it out Saints they said is Saul going to be in hell cuz he was an enemy enemy to God he said you can't put Saul in Hell unless you put Samuel there cuz Samuel said tomorrow you be with me I don't have it all figured out this was one question that I have had on my heart for years and I thought you know what I'm going to research this out and what was the heor of

Embrace to take me deeper deeper than I've ever been before I just want to love you more and more how I long to be deeper in love the Bible says that Solomon loved God he loved the Lord he just made a mistake he had an affinity with something he should have [Music] and in the third verse he goes and starts sacrificing in high places idolatry was already started DIY how easily it's overlooked and yet we go back in the Bible we see there's answers Nehemiah Ezra it happens Thou shalt not when you go and here we are in laiaa right in the midst of the worst of all ages you girls I want you to look nice I do the Lord carries you'll be a grandma soon enough but don't take your beauty out of Hollywood don't try to [Music] compete the Bible says and let the aged women the older women teach the younger how to love their husbands be Chas keepers of the home he said don't try to dress like Hollywood form fitting showing off your body said don't you realize that's a immoral Spirit on you see he shows it in its infancy form that's why I'm sometimes I think you know what I'm just a I'm just an angry old [Music] man I'm just a old [Music] fogy why don't you lighten up a little bit Ronald why do you have to preach stuff like this if you really loved it why why why don't you teach us deeper things like uh the gifts of the Spirit why don't you teach us you know the seven levels of heaven and all of this stuff and and get us all excited and everything and yet we miss the very thing and Solomon loved God and he had an affinity with Pharaoh why why Solomon you made your mistake man why didn't a Prophet come up and tell him why didn't say you shouldn't do it Solomon you need to repent I told you the history there was not one woman he married was from Israel was all politically then I asked does God overlook that and say it's okay when the very scriptures is against it so God loving Solomon told him because you have done this and you haven't kept my way I'm going to Ren the Kingdom from you you're going to suffer Solomon yet he's going to be saved he's God's not going to send him to hell just made a terrible mistake God help us here in this this hour Lord don't let some kind of little Affinity that shouldn't be there be there you know yeah I can give up everything to Christ except for sports I can give up everything except for the internet I can give up everything whatever
