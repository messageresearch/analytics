to be in the house of the Lord this morning this is the very reason why we are here Amen to worship him to glorify him amen and listen to his word amen thank you so much uh this morning that God allow us God allow me to stand this morning and uh some of the brothers say thank you brother Mario for your sermon wonderful sermon and I told him that it's just two way I also thank you for pulling on the gifts of God Amen so everything is all about God amen amen because as a minister we just seek the mind of the Lord and put it on our notes but when the service come when we are in the presence of God it is your duty to pull on the gft amen cuz we as a minister we are just like a waiter know if you don't order we cannot deliver Hallelujah so if you order we are happy to deliver amen sometimes with no tips it's just okay we are happy to deliver amen so it is a two-way not only you are hearing A good sermon but it is your po that operates the gift of God because the gift of God comes from God and is given to the church Hallelujah if giv it if given a gift we need to enjoy the gift that was given to us Amen Let Us bow our head most gracious Heavenly Father once again Lord we magnify thy name And We Worship You Lord this morning and thank you Lord for this great opportunity once again that we can humbly come before your presence Lord God with one purpose and that is to listen to you word this morning and I ask Lord that you hide me in your presence this morning that they may only see you Lord God and glorify th Name Lord and also pray for special blessing for brother R sister Sandy and also brother Stephen as he Minister Lord the word this morning and so Lord God be with us this morning Lord God as we come into your presence Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen thank you musician appreciate it so our uh song special we are really appreciate and brother Robert for opening his presence actually what we see to today is about Jesus is also what I'm going to preach this morning the title is he is risen that's the be purpose that we are here because he is risen and he promised because I leave you shall leave also amen amen and I trust that the Lord will move in the scene this morning that every what uh whatever needs we have God will just meet it according to the riches of his glory so turn with me in the book of Isaiah 63 verse 4 maybe I will just uh take my time this morning wherever the Lord leads amen so so I am depending on the presence of the Lord and I am also depending upon how you pull on the gate because if you are blessed I am blessed because sometime we study and as you pull sometime what comes out from our mouth is not even in our notes amen so it's according to how you pull that God will meet yes amen amen because he is alive amen amen he is risen and he is alive and some wonder where is he when he is alive amen so being born again baptized with the Holy Ghost we know that he is in our heart amen you don't look for any places for Christ amen just look beside you in front of you in back of you because Christ in the Throne of the heart of these people Isaiah 63:4 for the day of vengeance is in Mine Heart and the year of my redeem is come so you will notice vengeance is in my heart and the year of my redeem so the day of Vengeance and the time of redemption are always together in the Bible and we are now living in that day amen the same time judgments in the land against the people that rejected the message of the hour right it's the same time that the mercy of God is being poured out amen the same time that Noah was about to be redeemed and carried into the new Earth was the same time that judgment is in the land against the people that had rejected the message right in the time of Abraham and Sarah is the same thing before he judged Sodom praise God God visited Abraham and Sarah and I believe we are in the same time right now because we have the prophet which is the final Hallelujah the sign of judgment and God sent us a message of the hour and those who reject the message praise God will be on the Judgment of Goden Matthew chapter 28 verse 1- 2 and it say in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Don toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the Seiler so in the Book of Genesis which is in the beginning light came on the first day of the week amen and light brings life and light comes when the Sun rises Amen on the first day of the week let there be light and it brings life to whatever SE it is amen the Lord and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven so we are reading the scripture as a message believer we know that the seals was open so we are reading the scriptures based on the opening of The Seven Seals we no longer read the Bible according to the denominational understanding but since the opening of the SE Seven Seals we understand different the Bible becomes a new book our understanding is different and behold it was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and we also have an angel descended from heaven in this hour at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 21 the mighty angel coming down yes this event have repeated again in this day yes it's always in the present tense and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it so what did the stone seal it sealed the word amen so when the descending Angel broke the seal and rolled the stone away it opened the word that was sealed and that is what the opening of The Seven Seals did for us today amen when the descending angel with an open book in his right hand open the seal and reveal the word into our days hallelujah so my title this morning he is risen do you believe amen he is risen that's why we are here amen because he is risen so the subject is the three stages of how God revealed himself to us in his resurrection in this day amen because what happened then happens now we just have a more understanding what happened then because of the opening of The Seven seal so as brother George Martin once said you may now take your seat or may you take the comfort of your seat while I remain standing for an hour or God bless you amen so we'll continue on the same thought in Isaiah chapter 61 verse 1 and two which says the spirit of the Lord is upon upon me because the Lord had anointed me to preach the Good Tidings andto the meek he had sent me to bind the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison to them that are bound verse two to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance so we can read again the day of Vengeance to come all that mourn amen Vengeance and Redemption goes the same likewise so there is a 2,000 years g a time of Gap that divides this verse two into two parts the first part we believe that God fulfill it amen perform it at his first coming and the second part he's performing now at his second coming 2,000 years later so the second part of this verse is the work that he has come to do in this D day which is B Vengeance and comfort amen and we know that Abraham was being comforted while he was bringing vengance to Sodom so when Noah and his family were being conforted in the ark he was bringing judgment on the rest of the world likewise in these last days when the opening of The Seven Seals the mystery was given to the messenger of its age and when the messenger Cuts up praise God the revelation of the word he blasted in the slides and those who rejected the message are being judged that's right they were given PL but for those who receive the message of the hour you cannot receive the message of the hour unless you are ordained to receive it hallelujah it's a blessing for us to receive the message of the hour while this world H is become judgment so we can apply Malachi chap 4 verse1 in our day it says for behold the day cometh that's shall burn as an oven and shall and proud an and all that wickedly shall be sh shall be stubble so if you will notice he said that all the proud and do wickedly shall be stubbled two things will be judged pride and wickedness it is a repetitions of Noah's days people are full of Pride and full of wickedness because every thought on the imagination of their heart was EV continually they are so proud so when Noah say that God will just the Earth by because of your sin and wickedness they are so proud oh we cannot do the dirt science tell us that there is no rain there is no Thunder we we we don't believe it and God judg it amen and the day that cometh shall burn them up said the Lord of hosts this is speaking to our day in the days of Noah it was by the flood but in our day It Is by fire second Peter 3:10 but oh the day of the Lord will come as a th in the night it will come amen it will not delayed it will come in the night as a tip in the night in the which the heaven shall pass away with great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and the work that th there in shall be burned up it is on the way that's right while the judgment is on the way our changing of the body is on the way too because they are both comes together amen the message of the hour that's why the message of the hour is preparing us for the changing of our bodies we are gathering together in a supernatural way that's why the prophet said why are you hungering and thirsting church is your heavenly father trying to reveal to you something and what is this Reve to you something something that will make us or something that will help us praise God turn this Mortal into immortality that's why you desire to come into the house it is not your own desire but it was God's desire that put in your heart why do you hunger Church it is God himself who put the hungers and thirst in your heart because he was trying to reveal something in your heart he will not reveal it to anybody else he will reveal it to those he ordained before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and you cannot receive it by your own will even though how much you try Hallelujah to receive the message of the hour if you are not ordained you will never receive it that's why if we are here this morning we need to be happy amen mding of our head and smiling hallelujah our faces that is good but it will not give Justice to what he has done for us hallelujah we need to be happy don't be ashamed to worship Him don't be ashamed to say Thank You Lord sir amen smile is good but it cannot give Justice to what he has done that's right we need to praise him in our life Praise Him day praise him in the night praise him when the a everything we just need to pray him there is no reason to be sad or be depressed once the seals was open to you you know who you are the direction is being prepared there is no turning back my brother and [Music] sisters and he says and behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and the proud ye and all that do wickedly shall be stubbled and the the day that cometh shall burn them up said the Lord of hosts that he shall leave them neither root nor Branch so a root is a a person ancestry and a branch is his offspring so both ancestry and Offspring will will be wiped out just as it also was in the days of Noah amen only Noah ancestry and those who are in the ark praise God continue to flourish but everything else perish we ought to be thankful enough amen that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name this is always personal level of Revelation amen amen God is speaking directly be but unto you who is this you you need to claim that you is you amen because every word is given to you I will said Mali or Elijah to you it is so personal good but unto you that fear my name is only speaking about one name so trinitarian Doctrine is out of the picture that's right two Lo's Doctrine is out of the picture there is only one name Hallelujah especially when it comes to the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ those that fear his name because in the name of Jesus there there is power in the name of Jesus there is healing Hallelujah as we as we sing this morning in the name of Jesus there is salvation in the name of Jesus there is Deliverance in the name of Jesus there is Restoration in the name of Jesus there is redemption in his name there is the way where there seems to be no way sometimes there is something in our life that we we take something there's no way for this but there is a way Hallelujah not only a way but the way in his name there is the way in his name there is truth when a lot of fake news are coming out false Doctrine there is still the truth thank you Lord in his name there is life in his name there is fullness of joy and in his name there is peace so whatever situation you are in right now it is only an aimen a way for God to fulfill it Hallelujah if you believe it it is just an am in way whatever situation you are in may be sickness may you are bound Hallelujah it is just an am in away because he said in John 14:13 if ye shall ask anything in my name once again he personally challenge us whatever situation you are in right now he said if you shall ask anything ask anything he said I will do it so whatever situation you are in right now brother Mario cannot do it brother Ron cannot do it brother bam cannot do it but he said I will do it Hallelujah we need to raise the level of Faith right now because all his promise he is obligated to fulfill it no other man no other Ministry can fulfill what he promised he is the one that fulfill it don't limit the unlimited God just ask anything when you say anything anything that will hinder you anything that anything what's in your mind with your thought that you think it is impossible God is still in the business of making the impossible possible ask anything in my name and I will do it the present tense will do it that's right he knows your thought this morning he knows what you've been through this morning that's why he's challenged you I'm not challenging you but he is challenging you ask in my name and I will do it Hallelujah so whatever situation you are in right now don't be sad don't be discouraged because we are serving a living God and He Is Risen to prove his word among us ask anything in my name amen and I will do it thank you Jesus so in Matthew chapter 8 verse 5 to9 about the Centurion and we know the Centurion is a Roman army with uh sometimes 90 to 100 soldiers under his command and we know that a centurion is just a gentile right so this is example and when Jesus entered into the capernum they came unto him unto him a centurion besing him amen so when you come and ask God you need to Beek him and Beek means come before him with urgency urgent it is an urgent it's an emergency I need you Lord this morning whatever you are in I I say and I challenge Hallelujah there's nothing too hard for God that's right am you need to come him and be seeking him with urgency whatever you need you need to ask him right now with urgency with frequency amen hallelujah amen and saying Lord my servant lith at home sick of the py and grievously tormented whoever or whosoever or whatever com first in your mind may it be your friend your family your classmate whoever first that come into your mind you need to pray for that because God is putting you in action yeah because he is you are his coworker whatever name that God put in your heart first you need to pray for that don't just pray for yourself because this Centon Hallelujah is asking for his Soldier amen don't just pray for yourself alone God knows what our needs but there is somebody that needs that every person that comes your way you need to pray for that and he said saying Lord my servant lith at the homesick of py and grously tormented and and God answered right away if you call my name I will do it and he said I will come and heal him Hallelujah so his promise is cont with consistency Lord my servant lith and homesick of the P gly tormented he didn't ask him to come you just ask for prayer so if you have a need this morning you don't need to come to the pulpit to be prayed because when you asked he said I will come and heal you thank you Jesus his presence is already here because he promised wherever two or three are gathered in his name he will be in our midst so we need to be sensitive enough to know that we are praise that gathering together supernaturally every Gathering is Supernatural when you come you will never be the same when you come out that's right when you come in and you you're still the same there must be something in you because when Jacob as a supplanter as Cher backbite there he whistle with the angel he always looking at himself I am Jacob I am supplanter I am a liar I am a deceiver but the angel wants to tell him no you are not Jacob you are not supplanter you're not liar not you are a preacher of God so that's why he resol sometimes we we always look at oursel oh no I'm nothing no the message of hour is trying to point you that who you are you are not a strer you are not a Jacob you are not a Believer you are a pre of godall God that's why he wristle and when he recognize and accept the message of the angel that you are a prince of God there is an evilness he was limping something changed when he received the message of the he was limping walking liming that's why when you receive the message of Y there must be a change in your life maybe not instantly but little by little little by little little by little without knowing it God is moving on the scene just like my Paul my son Paul every one of us experien turbulence in our life so he suffered depression one time in his life when he's still single he ster depression we went in the Philippines and we keep calling him and he's not answering the P so we are so concerned we know our son when he was will not he will not talk to us there would be something happening so we went back to here in the states and we tried to talk to him knocking the door he will not he will not talk to us he will not open the door no nothing but during service time he dress up went to the church and he's always in this post of Duty playing guitar as if nothing happened and when he go back home the same thing happened I say nothing happened he's just in his door knocking and we are so worried and sometimes we just leave it unto the Lord as long as still going to church there might be something there will be a change you may not know it but there is a change when you go in the house of the Lord hallelujah every Wednesday he's playing the song every Wednesday every Sunday he just playing the song even though he was in the stat of depression but God hallelujah God is rich in Mercy delivered him from depression because you can never be the same unless you go to the church you may suffer some lukewarmness as long as you are in the church there must be a change in your life so Jacob was limping and limping he always look at I am Jacob I am nobody but the angel keep telling no no no no Jacob you are not a supplanter praise God you are not the deceiver you are a prince of God hallelujah and Paul CED up and said even even before they were born Jacob I hate but you Jacob I have love this is the message of the hour so let us go back to my notes amen that's the good thing when you are pulling I am going out of my notes but thank God I can come back again and the Centon answered said Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only speak the word only cuz Gentile faith is speaking the word into the exist Hallelujah he was and the prophet said and but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed speak the word only Lord he knows that he was a centurion Hallelujah with authority and command over his soldiers one but they recognize Hallelujah a higher authority and he said that for I am a men under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do it yes but he recognized a higher authority than himself right praise the Lord and even Jesus marvelled and when Jesus heard it confessing the word just speak the word only no interpretation no mislocation no misinterpretation of the word just speak the word only actually he was the one that's speaking just speak the word only and my servant will be healed he already finished confessing it Hallelujah God is only vindicating what he confessed just speak the word and my servant will be healed when he speak the word it was already done that's why Jesus Mar and Jesus heard it and marvelled and said to them that follow verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith know not in Israel Hallelujah faith in his word will bring his word to pass and he said in 18 and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way as thou H has believed so it was his faith in the word that healed the Centurion Jesus Christ has nothing to do with it because he said go thy way as thou Hast believed so be it done unto thee as thou believe so you whatever no matter what you are Hallelujah this morning just believe it because all the promises of God is just an amen way for him to fulfill it just say the word amen and my servant will be healed he was the one who say it amen and Jesus just confirm it Go thy way as thou Hast believed so it be done unto thee Hallelujah so your heart is where you believe from not because of your Sensation that you believe not because of of O any preacher that's so anointed that you believe no believing is from the heart because believing from the mind is just hope amen nothing wrong with that when you are hoping believing in the mind Hallelujah has the ability to reason that's right because if it will not come to pass you will reason against the word of God but believing from the heart there is no reasoning that's right only believe or doubt amen so we need to believe from the heart amen that everything is already being done deal amen right we ought to be happy you need to be inspired this morning we need to be inspired that our life that our God that we are serving is alive he is wien and he whatever he promised is going to fulfill it if you ask it in his name am that's so personal I will do it so that's why when we come into the house of the Lord expect the supernatural amen because whatever you asked and speak that's right he will confirm it if it is according to his word as the prophet said God will not be God un until he or or unless he fulfill what he promised amen right because the one who promised will be able to fulfill what he promised that's right or else he will not be God what a statement of repr from the Propet amen amen God is always in his word yes so we'll we'll continue Hallelujah but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healings in his wing the son of righteousness there is no other greater light than the sun amen hallelujah and the light brings life and we and I believe the greatest light of all is the Sun and that is through the spoken word of God but in our generation the s o n once again rise up amen and he push away all the darkness of unbelief in our day the Sun of righteousness arise with healings in his wings notice not healing in his feet not healing in his knees not healing in his tight not healing in his shoulder not healing in his head but healing in his wings Hallelujah it is a bird and that bird happens to be a prophet amen hallelujah amen and the prophet of Malachi Paul is an eagle an eagle brings an anointing an eagle anointing brings Revelation hallelujah hallelujah and the Gates of Hell cannot prevails against it there is a healing in his wings he Wings the Alpha and the Omega the old and the New Testament there will be healing from Genesis to Revelation there will be healing because it said I am the Alpha and the Omega there is healing because I am the beginning and I will be the end so whatever situation you are in right now my brother and sisters Hallelujah he said that I am the Alpha and Omega there is healing in his wings thank you Lord and healing means Restorations to your original amen position healings in his wings the Alpha and the Omega so everything that happens our way in between the Alpha and Omega is just the icing of the cake you may have troubles you have made discouragement but whatever he set in the beginning he will achieve at the end Hallelujah no amount of shortcomings no amount of Trials no amount of Temptation can take away what was in his mind at the beginning because there is an healing Hallelujah in the land healing means restoration to your original position where is your original position in the mind and in the thought of God that's right he never thought about you being a sinner he never thought about you being discouraged he never thought about you being depressed he never thought about you something he thought about as perfect in his life he thought about you as blameless he thought about you as holy he thought about you he justified he thought about you glorified he thought about you Sanctified healing in his wings I am the Alpha and the Omega we need to recognize the Propet in the last night bring healing we say praise the Lord prise the Lord healing brings us back to our original condition this is what the message is all about bringing us back to our original condition in the beginning that's why the prophet is said in this last days the opening of The Seven SE to let you know who you are because if you know who you are where you came from you will know where you're going you need to recognize and this is the message of the hour we are not following a man we are not following a cult but we are following the pillar of fire that is here in our midst amen he is still the same God he is still the same Pillar of Fire that's right when the prophet is out of the scene the pillar of fire is still here amen that's why still the anointing of God is still Among Us the healing is Among Us healing is the aess that there is a changing of our body Hallelujah because the prophet said the first Vindication of my Ministry of prophet is Divine Healing and Divine Healing is the ear of the Resurrection The Ear of the rupture if you are sick and you are heal praise be to God hallelujah because that is the aess that there will be a body change one of these days or else hallelujah or else we are just following a a cult or church no we are following the pillar of fire in this life you may ask where is the god of Elijah the god of Elijah is here the god of Elijah is unfolding his word to each and every one of us that's why you are responding to the word of Elijah because God was in [Applause] Elijah you Lord and you shall go forth and grow as a Cals to the soul hallelujah hallelujah we need to go as a c we just drink milk we have stages in our lives we drink milk and sometimes we go to the ox we labor come to the face of a man and get wisdom but guess what we are now in the eagle Hallelujah and the eagle anointing is to let you know who you are just like when God created Adam in spirit form male and female created them and called their name Adam one name that's right so when God created Man Out of the Dust of the earth he pull out that fous spirit and form a body Hallelujah and when the woman come out she didn't know who he was she didn't know who she was right we don't know about the message of the hour we don't know who we are we don't know about serving God but it was God himself who brought Eve to Adam because Adam know who he is and he know who she was that's why when Eve come into him he said you are a woman because you are now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh so that's why there is an eagal anointing in our day to let us know who we are we don't know who we are on that's right that's right that's why we enjoy so much the eagle story of our Prophet because we can relate by experience amen that we are born into this world we are born an eagle to begin with but we are born Hallelujah and there are more denominational brothers and sisters as we grow we act like like the same but there was something in our heart longing for something that's what the brother bam said when he preached the the the message God who is rich in Mercy when you are born in this world when you are still a little baby the seed of God was already in you if you are predestinated of God there is a representation in your life when you are still a little baby amen the seed was already in you and what is that seed The Germ of God the part word there's only one eternal life and that is God you must be a part of God in order to have eternal life so when you are still little B born in sin come to the word speaking life there is already a SE in you and when he comes grow he's wondering why there was a thirst there was a hungering seeking for God and he jumped from the Baptist Hall and cannot satisfy he jumped to the to the Jehovah Witness and there's nothing can satisfy he went to church from church to church longing to satisfy the no amount of church denomination can satisfi the thir then one day Hallelujah there is a message calling your name and you responded it and he said now I become Hallelujah a Son of God I was born in church in Branham but there was another one inside of me and when the word was squeaking into it he recognized I am another this is what the message is all about to let you know who you are that's why in our Eagle story he was the the the eagle was born and he's been with with a chicken he's eating what they he's just eating what the chicken is eating he jump from one fence Baptist fence then he jump to a Catholic fence then he jump to a church Pence then he jumped to a nazaran fence then he jump no no one can satisfy and he wonder why Hallelujah but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall spread his wing there is healing in the land Hallelujah when the voice of the sary shouted that recognize the word hallelujah and he knows her destination so this is what the message is all about to let you know who you are sir that's why even though every worship you just heard about predestination about before the foundation what this this is what the message is all about if you don't know who you are where are you going if you think you are not predestinated where are you going if you think you are not ordained before the foundation of where are you going who can satisfy your thirst that's why predestination is so important thing because your life is already destined to be in the presence of the Lord he is the alpha and he is the Omega what he start or set in the beginning he will finish it at the end that's why we are a finished product of God God could not be God Without You amen because you are a true worshipper of God there are a lot of worshippers but they don't know what they're worshiping at but since we have the opening of The Seven Seals we know who God was then we become a genuine worshiper unto God hallelujah God will not be God without you because you are created to worship him to reflect his character Hallelujah that's why predestination is a sacred word am you recognize where you came from and it will give you strength with joy to continue I am not an ordinary man I am predestinated Hallelujah unto adoption that is there no way Hallelujah that can get up because when the spirit of God comes in you he will seal you until the day of your Redemption do you agree it if you are sealed you cannot be unsealed because you are sealed until the day of your Redemption you can experience in extreme turbulence in your life you may have ups and downs to trial and testing depression complexity but it will never unseal what God has already sealed because you are sealed until the day of your Redemption you are still the day the day of the changing over your body [Music] hu if you are not enjoying the message of the hour you need to go to church more and more because Faith cometh by hearing and that hearing by the word of God if you don't recognize your name you need to be in an incubator to feel the temperature Amen to feel the temperature to break the shell let you recognize Hallelujah because the breaking of the shell of your neck is not from the outside it must be the inside with the right temperature of the presence of God you need to be in the incubator of God amen amen that's why if you don't say Amen or Rejoice I'm not discouraged amen I am preaching to those who can receive the word and enjoy it but if you are not enjoying it God bless you one of these days you will enjoy it because if you keep coming to church keep coming to church God is doing something Supernatural in your life hallelujah what of this day some of you that are not baptized will come into the presence of the Lord Lord I want to be baptized Hallelujah God is in the making God is still in the business of calling those whose name are written in the Lamb's Book of Life this is the time of recognizing our day this is the time of recognizing our day recognizing the amen the presence of the Lord Lord [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen so let us another add one dose of booster amen that's brother Rong let us put a mega do of the spiritual vitamins in this last Revelation chapter 1 or chapter 9 I verse 1-2 and the fif Angel sounded there so there is an angel a fif Angel sounded and I saw a star fall from Heaven andto the Earth so that's why we can see the falling stars so an angel is a messenger a falling star and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit so this Fallen star Fallen Angel was given the key to open the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose smoke out of the pit as the smoke of great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit so we can see Revelation 9 verse 1-2 we seldom hear about it being preached but as Prophet said the opening of the bottomless pit releases the fourth dimension of Science and Technology upon the people that would eventually give them access to hell where Revelation 10 verse one the mighty angel coming out give us access into heaven so hell and heaven is here at the same time that's right speaking about the dimension as the prophet said there are seven Dimension the First Dimension is light Hallelujah let there be light and light brings life yes and the second in Time and Time began when he fall because the prophet said the day you eat thereof the day you shall die before that there is no time limit that's why Adam have fellowship with God every time God came down in the cool of the evening and and open the truth to Adam Adam just say Amen Lord amen Lord he don't interpret he don't mislocate he this misconstrue the word he just amen Lord amen Lord amen Lord and he ended up with hallelujah amen amen that is our Heavenly language whatever country you are in and whatever language you are being preached to you respond with the same amen amen and Hallelujah because amen means so be it and Hallelujah means praise the Lord hallelujah so that's why every time there is a Fellowship just say Amen if you are a Believer practice saying amen amen amen because only those who experience Redemption rejoice in the presence of the Lord we have angels that is in Camp round about us amen so if we have a vacant seat be sure that there was Angel in there amen and the more you praise God yes the angel will look at it what are the aing at because he didn't experience salvation so that just look that's why there are three kinds of people those who make things happen can say Amen to every word and those who watch things happen and those who are wondering what happened I hope you are not one of these three Hallelujah so that's why when we come into the house of the Lord we will force you am we will force you to say Amen we will force you to say hallelujah amen not to deal on your emotion but the word is being spread that's why Adam say Amen Lord amen Lord amen Lord am amen Lord that's why Angel know nothing's about it that's right right because they were SED right to be a guardian they were in Camp round about us yes so when the word is being preached and you don't respond you will look like an angel because angels Don't response to the word Angel just wondering why are you an angel this morning or you are Sons and Daughters of God if you are Sons and Daughters of God you need to claim it shout it praise it don't be ashamed that you are Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah because God dwells in the presence of his people when you say shout when you say Amen when you say hallelujah the more you will feel presence of the Lord we need to be grateful of what he has done for us the more we become thankful the more blessings to come you cannot be unsealed when you are sealed thank you Jesus prise the Lord we Are Not Angels We Are Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's right although there were time that we become silent as brother R said it's better than you are silen it means you are listening but make sure that you're listening right make sure that you are not murmuring make sure that you are not saying something against somebody else because your action speaks louder than your word amen make sure that you're praising God make sure when you are silent you are listening to the word of God Amen because the spirit is moving the spirit is speaking he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches amen Revelation 1 verse1 and he opened the bottomless pit and there AR Rose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of great fur and the Sun and the air so First Dimension is light second dimension Hallelujah is time and third dimension is matter and mass matters amen the fourth dimension is science and technology that's why when they open when they open the bottomless pit there was there came a fourth dimension that we see on the television we see it there they exist that's why all the movies that we that has been showing all around us where did they get that inspiration inspiration to create a monster inspiration to have mass murder inspiration for mass destruction where did that inspiration come [Music] from thank you when the fourth dimension was being released even the so-call Believers are being affected all those games they not just game they are inspiration coming from the bottomless pit and they are trying to draw your attentions away from the word of God you spend sometimes all the young people even the old people spend their time and effort praise God even money to play the games yes where did that inspiration come from you see the bottomless speed is open that's why all the immorality all there is anointing that is being released the anointing to make all the people disbel to the word of God that's why when you feel lukewarmness there must be something do you need to check you feel the coldness as brother Ron where what are you feeding at why you feel youor why you feel so cold what are you eating at amen amen when the seal was open Revelation 10:1 the access to tree of life was open we can feed on the tree of life and the tree of life is no other the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and he said I am the life and the truth and my word there spirit and their life the heaven is open why spend your time in the bottomless pit inspiration the Hollywood the fashion of the word all the magazine all the movies that we see look around us yes it's all about murder violence [Music] rape that's why you are wondering why I am so lukor why is my my family is not intact why is it what are you feeding on Amen don't waste your time right seeking on those things of the world no one will glory you if you win the games they will give you a million if you win for example then after that if you have no character you will spend it just one day then you become a beggar again what can you get from feeding on this world you are feeding praise God on the bottomless P this we being open right that's why brother Ron is so balanced because some of us especially young people even the old people yes they spend their time for nothing for games amen what are your game sometime the games are zomie and you're trying to win you're trying to win a city all kind of you know that you're not strange about it but I want you to know that it comes from the inspiration of the bottomless pit because there was an angel falling down with a open with a with a key in his hand to open every time they open there is anointing released to pull you away from believing the word of God to pull you away to pull your attention away from the word of God wherein the tree of life is open that you have boldness and access to enter in why don't you eat from the tree of life because the more you eat the more you become what you eat and one of these days praise God when you e so much the word the word will control your flesh and you will become like K amen and he was not Hallelujah because the word that is feeling translate him and no one seen him because he was not but he has a testimony before his translation that he pleased God you can only please God by believing his word in this last day amen you cannot please God by how much desire you serve God that is good but make sure your desire is on the basis of the word of God some you desire it on your own way just like Kane was his desire is to worship God he was sincere is Desiring God and in fact the scriptures say he offered a sacrifice excellent sacrifice yes amen nothing wrong with your desire but the problem Cain has no problem with worshiping God he worshiped with all his heart with all his mind mind but his problem was it's not how to worship but his problem was he wants to do to do it in his own way right even after God revealed to him if you follow what your brother is doing I will accept your sacrifice but he is doing it his own way make sure if you desire from your heart it comes from the word of God because if you are predestinated and Su oh I am predestinated I can do whatever I want I can do to anywhere I can go to I can go to the to the the bar or so I can do whatever I want so I'm telling you if that is your thinking that is that comes from a bottomless pit because the prophet said there was a question oh brother if I am predestinated before the foundation of the word I can do whatever I want and the prophet say sure you can do whatever you want but I guarantee you you will never decide to commit sin because if you are born again the seed of God is in you you will never decide to commit sin you become a new Creator so if are thinking is I can do whatever I want I want to do this I want to do no just like when when Peter said I want to build you another Temple and the Lord said get behind thee get behind me Satan amen so we need to make sure that our desire is in the word of God because if you are predestinated you have no other way but to come to the Fulfillment of where you are predestinated to be thank you Lord you are predestinated unto adoption you will be sitting upon the throne of God remember in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 when the angels have come up a little bit higher come up here John and I will show you things to come it is a type of the that the spirit of God Is Lifting Up into a prophetic fulfillment of his word and God show him there was a door open in lysia there was a closed door yes that's why God is knocking he is trying to enter but when the spirit of God said come up a little bit higher John There Was An Open Door amen hallelujah there is an Open Door for the Bride of Jesus Christ the door to the throne of God and there he saw 24 sitting around the throne and he saw these 12 angels 12 Patriarchs and 12 Apostle while John was in the spirit Hallelujah he already saw the 12 partch and 12 Apostles sitting on the throne the prophetic Ministry the prophetic Vision let him know that he was already sitting on the throne even though he is still in the Patmos Vision in the Patmos island of Patmos but the vision that is being lifted up a prophetic Ministry show him AOS Hallelujah that he is now sitting in the throne with the 12 part and 12 abos he saw his self in the throne amen this is what the prophetic Ministry is about to tell you where you are and where you came from to tell you your position that's right am Revelation 10 1 verse2 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down so the fifth angel come down from heaven with an open with a key to open the bottomless pit but this is another Angel and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven cloth with a cloud Hallelujah the cloud of Witnesses amen and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun you see the sun always represent the greater light amen and his feet as pillars of fire here we are again judgment and mercy coming at the same time and he had in his hand a little book open so when that this is open book in in Revelation 4 it is a closed book but here hallelujah it is an open book yes that's why we need to know that's why the opening of The Seven seal the open book is just being preach and preach all over again because you need to recognize who you are amen hallelujah it is not just like just quoting scripture and quoting scripture it must be personal experience that you recognize your name in the book and we say that what is this name what what what is the name for it is your name Hallelujah when you recognize the message that was sent in your day and you responded by Revelation this is your name being called in this last day Hallelujah that's why it is so important to know our position in the book amen examine amen there is no turning back amen Hallelujah and he had in his little book had a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth Revelation 9:1 giving people access to Hell through the technology of televisions and internet and that access is what bringing that Dimension into this dimension of the world that we live in what we are looking all around us came from that fourth dimension of Hell amen but Revelation 101 and2 the opening of the seventh Dimension which is giving us access to eat of the tree of life so the seventh Dimension is where the Lord got us that's why when the prophet is only a seventh grade he came his knowledge from the seventh dimension of God in the days of the voice of the seventh angel a seventh grade and seventh Dimension is the seventh Dimension where God is so the message that we are feeding on is not the message of a man it is the message of God from the seventh Dimension given to us you are feeding on the life word the bread of life of God in this last days giving us access into the Tree of Life once again and when we walk into that light because there is no other greater light than the Sun and in this resurrect time time at this rising of the sun there is a rising of the S oom to give life unto the children of God so let Keep On Walking keep walking on the light Hallelujah keep walking on the light until the day that the Lord Jesus Christ will change your mortal body into Immortal just keep walking in the light there may be persecution while you are walking with God persecution from your work persecution from your family persecution from anyone else persecu but keep walking on keep it on walking on because you have the sure word of Prophecy in this last day the word is being Vindicated all over the word just keep on walking if they say against it just keep on walking until Enoch was not hallelujah amen one of this day we will walk in and we will be watching not it's already happened and it will continue to happen because he is the same yesterday today and forever and Revelation 10:7 is the seventh seal Redemption message of Grace and it is the title deed of redemption being turned and Back Again amen oh we so enjoy praise God just like adab we enjoy listening to the word of God amen hallelujah amen hallelujah he enjoyed life he have no pain no sorrow no death no pain no nothing no complexity no inferiority complex no depression he was so happy and when he is Bored he can just say okay I'm going to the east side of the Garden in my thought I'm going that way then in the split second he was there yes am that's why this movie about the teleporting where did they get that inspiration in the book of God in the Book of Genesis you see some of the movies that they are teleporting you are here were in the US and if you think you're going to New York then when a split second you were in New York where did the inspiration come from because everything that is good come from God and Satan always pervert what God has done done so this teleporting thing is come from God Adam say I want to go to the east side of the garden then he was there yes I want to do this SP amen hallelujah amen even the prophet said 40 days he will appear and disappear when God resurrect he just walk through the wall amen and he's on the other side yes it happen then it will happen now amen because we are now approaching Hallelujah this Dimension where God is for all things are possible to them that love God hallelujah he has no fear no pain no sorrow no death just pleasing God every time with the evening call if if they have fellowship with God he just say Lord pressing and honor and glory and power unto your name he tried to worship God he tried to play with all the animals when he was borned he said Mr gorilla come and let us play wrestling he can play with the gorilla amen Mr lion come over here and I will ride you at the back what we see all around us happens back back then you see people playing with lions you see people playing with the Puma Leopard with the El it will be horses amen you can see it Lauren because it happened before it before we witness a here and I believe we are returning back to the original because there is a swing there is a healing in his wing and we are returning back again to that original condition Hallelujah I am the Alpha and the Omega so no one can separate you from the love of God Amen not only you are sealed but Paul said your Redemption is eternal Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11 he said but Christ being come on high priest I haven't preached the rising of he is risen yet but I don't know if I can finish it but Hebrew 911 but Christ being come on the high priest of good good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made
