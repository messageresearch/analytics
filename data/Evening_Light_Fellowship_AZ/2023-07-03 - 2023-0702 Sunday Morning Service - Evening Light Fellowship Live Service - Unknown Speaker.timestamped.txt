[35:49] [Music]
[35:52] let's just bow our heads our hearts
[35:55] together
[35:56] if you have an unspecial
[35:59] spoken or a special unspoken request
[36:03] would you raise your hand right now and
[36:06] ask God
[36:08] you have not because you ask not
[36:11] so when you ask ask abundantly
[36:15] God is mindful of what you go through he
[36:17] is mindful of everything about you
[36:21] heavenly father as we raise our hands
[36:24] and we come to you this morning we know
[36:27] that you are Jehovah Jireh we have seen
[36:30] time and time again age after age
[36:34] church after church we have seen how you
[36:37] have watched over your little bride
[36:40] from her birth all the way father to her
[36:43] rapture
[36:44] so father we thank you and we love you
[36:47] and we ask that you will meet every need
[36:49] by the ministering of the word because
[36:52] when the word Goes Forth it delivers the
[36:55] people it heals the people it positions
[36:57] the people therefore father I pray come
[37:00] and speak to our hearts now I ask in
[37:03] Jesus Christ's name
[37:05] amen
[37:07] amen God bless you all this morning
[37:09] let's just remain standing
[37:12] let's go directly to the word
[37:15] amen
[37:17] uh
[37:19] we want to thank you all thank you
[37:21] musicians yes
[37:23] I want to thank all of you for your
[37:25] prayers for our daughter for re Rebecca
[37:28] the surgery went very well the surgeons
[37:32] were very very optimistic of the
[37:35] surgeries they've done but understand
[37:36] doctors Doctor surgeons do their surgery
[37:40] but God's A Healer
[37:42] they can cut they can sow they can do
[37:45] all that thing they can give medicine
[37:46] but God is the Healer
[37:48] so we still all need God huh even after
[37:51] surgery even after all that stuff God is
[37:54] still the one who heals
[37:57] amen and brother Paul Maple is here
[38:00] where are you brother Paul
[38:02] yeah he and his family have moved down
[38:04] here raise your hand all your family
[38:06] there and yeah yeah they're there so we
[38:09] uh we welcome you they've moved down
[38:11] here
[38:12] Hallelujah
[38:15] his dad's down here just uh just for the
[38:18] until today and then he's going back but
[38:21] Dave God bless you it's good to have you
[38:22] here amen
[38:25] all right I want to put a disclaimer
[38:31] on this and I understand that
[38:34] when your pastor comes here to the
[38:36] pulpit and everything I realize that I
[38:38] wait before God and I seek God for our
[38:41] church and for our people
[38:43] okay I'm not responsible for what others
[38:47] do and how they see it
[38:49] or whatever so god holds me responsible
[38:51] to teach you truth
[38:54] and uh uh brother Branham said every
[38:57] church is Sovereign in itself
[39:00] he said even Branham Tabernacle you
[39:02] voted in Ormond Neville and said if he
[39:05] wants to preach
[39:06] Jehovah's Witness Doctrine because you
[39:09] voted him in he said that's the
[39:12] sovereignty of the local assembly now
[39:16] um so
[39:17] um even as our sisters I appreciate the
[39:20] song special beauty is in the eye of the
[39:22] beholder
[39:23] and I know that the beauty of a church
[39:27] is the character of the people
[39:31] amen and so we pray that our character
[39:35] that we have is the character of Christ
[39:39] let us this Simplicity of the Gospel of
[39:42] Jesus Christ should not be lost in rules
[39:46] and regulations and laws and doctrines
[39:49] and teachings of the church because if
[39:52] we're not careful that makes us
[39:53] religious
[39:55] and then we just come and we are no
[39:58] different than Mennonites or Amish or
[40:01] whatever and we go about our religious
[40:04] duties but the main thing is
[40:07] is that we have a relationship with
[40:09] Jesus Christ
[40:11] amen and we fall in love with him and
[40:13] you can you can uh bring your children
[40:16] to church and everything but they must
[40:20] have
[40:21] an experience with God themselves
[40:24] Jacob had Bethel experiences it never
[40:27] changed him
[40:29] he saw angels ascending a descending he
[40:32] said this is a special place I call it
[40:34] the Bethel the house of God but it was
[40:38] not until he got to the place called
[40:40] pineal where he met God face to face
[40:45] father I'm asking today as your servant
[40:49] come down
[40:50] speak to us
[40:52] speak to us face to face
[40:55] give us what we have need of that our
[40:57] lives would be greater
[40:59] than than what they were when we came
[41:01] this morning
[41:03] that God will draw us that much closer
[41:05] to him that will fall in love because
[41:07] it's because of love not because of law
[41:10] amen
[41:12] all right
[41:13] let's just pray father I ask a blessing
[41:16] upon Thy word now as we read it
[41:19] anointed by the Holy Spirit father that
[41:22] we can see the truth from thy mysterious
[41:25] word knowing it's a closed book to those
[41:28] without the Holy Ghost I pray o God give
[41:31] everyone a portion of the Holy Ghost o
[41:35] God that we could see into the
[41:37] scriptures
[41:38] that we just don't read laws Creeds
[41:41] dogmas traditions of man but father that
[41:45] we might see you Christ the center of
[41:47] every scripture in Jesus Christ's name
[41:50] we ask it amen amen all right God bless
[41:54] you all
[41:55] second Corinthians 11 verses 1 through 4
[42:02] we're continuing on now with our series
[42:04] here maybe another couple Services we'll
[42:06] see how the Lord leads
[42:08] amen second Corinthians chapter 11
[42:12] verses 1 through 4.
[42:17] what to God you could bear with me a
[42:20] little in my folly
[42:22] and indeed bear with me
[42:25] for I am jealous over you with a Godly
[42:28] jealousy
[42:30] for I have espoused you to one husband
[42:34] that I'm represent to you as a chaste
[42:37] virgin to Christ
[42:39] but I fear
[42:42] he's got his doubts
[42:44] he's got his concerns
[42:47] but I fear less by any means the serpent
[42:53] as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[42:55] subtlety
[42:57] so your minds should be corrupted from
[43:00] the Simplicity that is in Christ
[43:05] for if he that cometh preacheth another
[43:08] Jesus
[43:11] whom we have not preached or if you
[43:14] receive another Spirit which you have
[43:17] not received or another gospel
[43:21] which you have not accepted you might
[43:24] well bear with him
[43:28] amen
[43:30] second Corinthians
[43:32] 1.
[43:35] chapter 1 verse 12.
[43:44] for our rejoicing is this
[43:47] the testimony of our conscience
[43:50] that in Simplicity and godly sincerity
[43:55] not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace
[43:59] of God we have had our conversation in
[44:02] the world and more abundantly to
[44:05] you were
[44:07] turning back to Second Corinthians
[44:09] chapter 11.
[44:12] verses 13 through 15. now he warns him
[44:16] I'm I'm afraid less by any means
[44:21] that the devil through his subtlety
[44:24] could come and corrupt your minds
[44:27] from the Simplicity that is in Christ so
[44:30] as you read down he then shows you some
[44:33] of the means that by which
[44:35] Satan will attempt to uh uh to get to
[44:41] the bride of Christ
[44:43] second Corinthians 11 verses 13 through
[44:46] 15.
[44:48] for such are false apostles
[44:51] deceitful workers
[44:54] transforming themselves into the
[44:57] Apostles of Christ notice the
[44:59] transformation is not God's doing
[45:04] they do it themselves
[45:07] transforming themselves
[45:10] into the Apostles of Christ and no
[45:13] Marvel
[45:16] for Satan himself is transformed into an
[45:19] angel of Light
[45:23] therefore it is no great thing if his
[45:26] ministers also
[45:29] be transformed as the Ministers of
[45:32] righteousness
[45:34] whose end shall be
[45:36] according to their works
[45:39] may God bless the reading of his word
[45:40] you may be seated this morning
[45:43] in the presence of God
[45:47] amen I am titling my sermon losing our
[45:51] Simplicity this is part three
[45:55] and the subject this morning is
[45:59] transformed ministers
[46:02] now last service I talked about
[46:04] corrupted Minds
[46:06] how do they do it
[46:08] through transformed ministers
[46:11] they have transformed themselves as the
[46:14] Apostles of Christ
[46:17] now the Bible says we have tried them
[46:20] who call themselves
[46:22] Apostles and are not
[46:26] how do you do it by the word
[46:29] everything every measurement every
[46:31] judgment everything must come to the
[46:35] basis of the word of God because the
[46:37] word of God is our absolute
[46:39] not my opinion not your opinion not my
[46:42] interpretation not your interpretation
[46:44] because God is his own interpreter
[46:48] amen
[46:50] so I wish to go in this direction now
[46:53] I'm going to give you scriptures and I'm
[46:56] going to give you some quotes
[46:58] because I believe saints of God that
[47:01] what you do
[47:03] is you substantiate everything of your
[47:06] doctrinal teaching to your church in
[47:10] scripture and then back it up with the
[47:12] message of the hour
[47:14] amen and so that's what I tried to do
[47:16] the reason I have you to read the quotes
[47:18] I put them up here is because I have
[47:21] seen how masterfully different ones will
[47:25] be acting like brother Branham said in
[47:27] God and simplicity and they go to acting
[47:30] like they're reading and if you're
[47:32] familiar enough with the message and
[47:34] you've got the message in your heart and
[47:36] they just keep reading and the next
[47:38] thing they're acting as though they're
[47:40] still reading the quote they're not
[47:43] now here is my doctrinal teaching
[47:46] quotes are good
[47:49] the tapes are better
[47:51] because when you go listen to the tape
[47:54] you hear the inflection of The Voice
[47:57] you catch it in its context because if
[48:00] there's one thing or three things that
[48:02] we should not do with the word of God we
[48:05] must not misplace it we may not must not
[48:07] misinterpret it or dislocate the word of
[48:10] God in any way
[48:12] amen so I believe that the prophet of
[48:16] God
[48:17] as the Holy Spirit was directing him
[48:21] what happens is now he's taking the
[48:24] surgical sword of the word and he begins
[48:28] to discern between the body and spirit
[48:31] and the spirit and soul
[48:35] brother Branham said no now watch this
[48:37] let me give you an example of that
[48:40] brother random said you can have the
[48:42] Holy Spirit 24 hours a day in your soul
[48:45] on its way to hell
[48:48] that's his doctrinal teaching your soul
[48:51] he said it depends on the level of the
[48:54] anointing because you can have the Holy
[48:57] Spirit on your spirit
[49:00] Caiaphas prophesied
[49:03] you can have the Holy Spirit on your
[49:07] spirit activating the gifts of the
[49:10] Spirit and you're not even born again
[49:15] so we're not judging it by that
[49:18] we judge it by the word
[49:21] so these are doctrinal teachings that
[49:25] brother brennam makes very very clear to
[49:27] us as he ministers
[49:29] you'll not get all of his doctrinal
[49:31] teaching on one sermon
[49:34] neither do you get all of the Biblical
[49:37] teaching
[49:38] in one book
[49:40] it is an accumulation of the whole word
[49:43] together
[49:45] brother Branham said on the testimony on
[49:47] the sea in 1962
[49:51] I've been trying to keep the messages
[49:52] just as simple as possible
[49:55] but of course
[49:57] that's so no one will miss it there's
[50:00] great deep spiritual teachings to it but
[50:04] sometimes you can't do that before an
[50:06] audience
[50:08] we must keep it simple so the newborn
[50:10] babes will not miss it
[50:13] because I believe that we're too close
[50:15] to the end time for us to miss anything
[50:19] oh God help us keep this message simple
[50:23] amen
[50:24] he continues on
[50:27] and that's the reason I've been trying
[50:28] to keep the messages just as simple as
[50:31] possible
[50:33] and what I'm trying to do now maybe some
[50:35] of you might be wondering why I'm not
[50:37] calling prayer lines each night
[50:41] here's my purpose in doing this
[50:44] I want to build faith in the people in a
[50:48] resurrected Jesus
[50:50] so that you don't have to wait till some
[50:53] special gift passes through the
[50:55] neighborhood
[50:57] you just believe him wherever you are
[51:00] because he's gone
[51:02] it doesn't take an evangelist's hands
[51:06] which that's all right they Place her in
[51:08] faith
[51:10] and it continues on
[51:13] and so
[51:14] brother Brandon was trying I want you to
[51:17] understand that when the prophet of God
[51:19] comes on the scene
[51:21] and he's given two gifts
[51:25] to get the attention of the people but
[51:27] he said that's just the
[51:29] he said that's the sign that's the
[51:31] attraction he said but there's a voice
[51:32] that comes behind it
[51:34] Now understand that brother Branham
[51:36] remember
[51:38] that what we call Pentecost of laudiasia
[51:43] started in 1906.
[51:46] brother Brennan was born in 1909.
[51:49] so the Pentecostal movement had already
[51:52] started moving and like wildfire it
[51:54] began to now just spread throughout the
[51:56] world
[51:59] and so brother Branham when he comes to
[52:03] the crescendo of his ministry when he
[52:06] comes to the Apex
[52:08] of his ministry he's trying to even wean
[52:13] his own Believers at Branham Tabernacle
[52:16] away from former teaching
[52:19] he will preach sermons such as where
[52:22] Pentecost field
[52:26] and he's trying to then wean them if you
[52:29] please
[52:30] away from former teaching
[52:33] okay
[52:36] no
[52:37] we realize
[52:40] that a religious spirit
[52:42] upon a person watch this now a religious
[52:46] spirit upon a person will blind them to
[52:49] any truth other than what they've been
[52:52] taught
[52:53] remember when you first come to the Lord
[52:55] and you were trinitarian my it was so
[52:58] hard for you
[53:00] to get through your mind that God is not
[53:03] three Gods he's not father God Son God
[53:05] the Holy Spirit God but he's these three
[53:07] are one why because you were taught that
[53:10] so you look through the eyes of your
[53:13] understanding
[53:16] okay to that Doctrine and it's hard for
[53:19] you to overcome why because you were
[53:21] indoctrinated
[53:24] in that way now the Apostle Paul is a
[53:27] perfect example
[53:29] Saul of Tarsus who became Paul
[53:32] the Apostle he's a perfect example of a
[53:36] religious spirit
[53:37] Now understand a religious spirit
[53:41] will persecute even unto death those
[53:45] that disagree with his viewpoint
[53:48] that's what he did
[53:51] and
[53:53] he had been taught under one of the
[53:55] greatest theologians of that day
[53:57] gamalielium
[53:59] and he said Can keeping the law I was
[54:01] blameless
[54:03] I was a Pharisee of Pharisees
[54:07] and he was a religious zealot Now
[54:10] understand this
[54:13] religion without the character of Christ
[54:18] can persecute others who don't see it
[54:21] the way you do
[54:25] now there's many quotes and I'm not
[54:28] going to go into it right now but
[54:29] brother Brahm said how what do you do do
[54:33] you have people that disagree with you
[54:34] yeah sure all the time why even my wife
[54:37] and I don't agree on everything
[54:39] and he talks about whipped cream and all
[54:42] of that stuff and I'm not going to go
[54:43] into that but he said sure he said in
[54:46] fact you can come to this church
[54:47] disagree with me as far as East is from
[54:51] West but keep the right spirit
[54:54] the right spirit is teachable
[54:58] I tell you what I have in my personal
[55:01] experience I have met people that claim
[55:03] they are message Believers and they got
[55:05] a spirit as mean as a junkyard dog
[55:11] I've seen it
[55:13] and if you haven't just hang on you'll
[55:16] meet one of them one of these days and
[55:17] when you do don't let it offend you
[55:21] now
[55:23] uh brother Brenham said in getting in
[55:26] the spirit 1961
[55:28] we got too many Beaver preachers today
[55:31] you ever heard this quote it's kind of
[55:34] cute
[55:34] he only says it one time Beaver
[55:36] preachers
[55:39] today trying to Dam up all the water and
[55:41] say this is ours this is just us here
[55:45] this belongs to us
[55:47] what happens to it it becomes stagnated
[55:51] you know stagnated water that gets these
[55:54] little wiggle tails in it that's what
[55:56] does matter with the church today little
[55:59] wiggle tail in here and wiggle out there
[56:02] and and now brother Branham him being a
[56:04] Woodsman he said now anyone who's a
[56:06] Woodsman knows you don't drink below a
[56:09] beaver dam
[56:11] hehe
[56:13] he said it'll make you sick
[56:16] excuse me
[56:18] now we know that this message will never
[56:21] denominate is that is that correct
[56:23] because the message is Christ
[56:25] you cannot denominate Christ because
[56:28] Christ is the word
[56:31] but many of those within the message
[56:33] have already denominated because they've
[56:36] made their fences they've made their
[56:39] divisions I am appalling and I am of
[56:41] Apollos and the next thing you know the
[56:44] Apostle Paul he said who's Paul and
[56:46] who's Apollos why in the world do we
[56:49] have to Champion well my pastor is
[56:51] better than your pastor my dad can beat
[56:53] up your dad that's nonsense
[56:56] God help us even if they see it
[57:00] differently than we do that's the
[57:03] sovereignty of a local assembly
[57:07] I do not like politicians I am not a
[57:10] politician I don't like it I've never
[57:13] fit in with certain ones because you
[57:17] know if you see it their way finally Pat
[57:19] you on the back
[57:20] but if you don't see it that way then
[57:22] you're kind of
[57:24] whatever
[57:27] you're never asked to minister
[57:30] that's okay I'm not looking for another
[57:32] place to preach
[57:33] now let me show you
[57:37] the Simplicity that the Apostle of Paul
[57:41] when he came on the scene remember he
[57:44] says I was one born out of due season
[57:49] he had a personal experience with God
[57:51] and wrote to Damascus
[57:55] God has to Blind him to open his eyes
[57:58] and then after he had this experience
[58:01] with God he went and he got alone with
[58:05] God for three years but when he comes
[58:09] out and he joins up and has a union with
[58:13] those Apostles that were before him
[58:18] Now understand he was born out of due
[58:20] season so he has to come to even Peter
[58:24] who's trying to make Jews out of the
[58:26] Gentiles and he has to rebuke him
[58:29] imagine that
[58:32] I can imagine Peter said who are you man
[58:34] you were dear you weren't with him I was
[58:37] there I was in his meetings man
[58:40] of all okay
[58:43] First Corinthians 2 verses one through
[58:45] eight I got to keep going because I got
[58:46] a lot of my uh Fork this morning
[58:51] First Corinthians 2 verses one through
[58:52] eight and I Brethren when I came to you
[58:56] came not with the Excellency of speech
[58:58] or of wisdom declaring unto you the
[59:02] testimony of God for I determined not to
[59:06] know anything among you so now he's
[59:09] taken all of learning all of this
[59:12] Gamaliel all of the theology everything
[59:14] he's learned
[59:17] I'm determined not to know anything
[59:20] except
[59:21] save Jesus Christ and him crucified
[59:26] saints of God the whole gospel revolves
[59:29] around Jesus Christ and him crucified
[59:33] amen
[59:35] and I was with you in weakness and in
[59:37] fear and in much trembling
[59:40] and my speech my preaching was not with
[59:42] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[59:45] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[59:47] that your faith should not stand in the
[59:49] wisdom of men
[59:51] but in the power of God how about yet we
[59:54] speak wisdom among them which are
[59:56] perfect
[59:57] not yet the wisdom of this world nor the
[1:00:00] princes of this world
[1:00:02] that come to not but we speak the wisdom
[1:00:05] of God in a mystery even the Hinduism
[1:00:08] which God ordained before the world unto
[1:00:11] our Glory
[1:00:13] which none of the princes of the world
[1:00:16] knew for had they known it they would
[1:00:19] not have crucified the Lord of Glory
[1:00:22] when God converted Saul
[1:00:27] and
[1:00:28] opened his eyes to the truth he
[1:00:31] condensed everything he had learned down
[1:00:33] to Jesus Christ and him crucified that's
[1:00:36] the whole theme of The Gospel
[1:00:39] that is Jesus Jesus Christ in simplicity
[1:00:45] once you find Christ and he reveals
[1:00:47] himself to you it's so simple and I
[1:00:50] believe we are losing our Simplicity
[1:00:52] that is in Christ
[1:00:54] now I just happened to see a little clip
[1:00:56] of something yesterday and it caught my
[1:00:58] attention
[1:01:00] there was a minister ministering he said
[1:01:02] I want to talk
[1:01:04] to the thief on the cross when he gets
[1:01:07] to the other side
[1:01:10] I want to talk to him and ask him
[1:01:13] what did you do to get here
[1:01:16] he said I really don't know
[1:01:20] well do you understand the doctrine of
[1:01:23] justification by faith nope never heard
[1:01:27] it preached
[1:01:29] well do you understand about the blood
[1:01:31] of Christ and the crucifixion and
[1:01:33] everything
[1:01:34] no no I I really don't know
[1:01:38] and so he asked him a couple more
[1:01:39] scriptural questions and you know how we
[1:01:42] want to know hey where what church are
[1:01:45] you from what did you do this and that
[1:01:47] he said well how did you get here
[1:01:50] well I really don't know but the man
[1:01:53] on the middle cross
[1:01:56] invited me and bit me to come
[1:01:59] that is the gospel in simplicity
[1:02:02] we try to make it so
[1:02:05] complex
[1:02:07] when God bids you to come he bids you to
[1:02:10] come and die hallelujah how do you get
[1:02:13] there I don't really know all I know is
[1:02:15] he bit me to come how many of you can
[1:02:17] say Amen to that it wasn't you it wasn't
[1:02:20] anything you did it wasn't the works you
[1:02:22] did it wasn't because of Mom and Dad it
[1:02:24] was because God called you
[1:02:27] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:31] don't lose our simplicity
[1:02:34] amen spiritualism watch this now
[1:02:37] spiritualism Witchcraft and demonic
[1:02:40] powers are religious spirits
[1:02:44] they claim they are of God and speak for
[1:02:47] God
[1:02:49] Pentecost failed watch this Pentecost
[1:02:52] failed because they wanted the gifts
[1:02:54] without The Giver
[1:02:56] they wanted the sensations
[1:02:58] they wanted the speaking in tongues they
[1:03:01] wanted the gifts and they didn't care
[1:03:02] what kind of Life they live now watch
[1:03:05] this
[1:03:06] okay so that you'll understand this
[1:03:09] brother Brennan said in 1963
[1:03:13] in oh Lord just once more did you know
[1:03:16] the Roman Catholic Church was the first
[1:03:18] original
[1:03:19] Pentecostal Church
[1:03:22] it's Taken 2 000 years to get it in the
[1:03:25] condition it's got today
[1:03:28] if this Pentecostal organization
[1:03:32] keeps on another 50 Years it'll be worse
[1:03:37] than the Catholic Church
[1:03:40] isn't that amazing he took the Catholic
[1:03:43] Church
[1:03:43] two thousand years to get where they're
[1:03:45] at and he said give this
[1:03:47] Pentecostal Church another 50 years
[1:03:52] so we're there we're past that
[1:03:56] and he says it'll be worse than the
[1:03:59] Catholic Church
[1:04:01] so
[1:04:03] you don't have to try to work something
[1:04:05] up in the church
[1:04:07] let God do it
[1:04:09] I will show you every time that God
[1:04:11] moves
[1:04:13] he does it without your help
[1:04:17] on a day of Pentecost they were sitting
[1:04:22] the only thing they did do was get in
[1:04:24] one Accord
[1:04:26] and in one mind
[1:04:28] God help us to get in one mind one
[1:04:30] Accord
[1:04:32] looking at the faults and this and that
[1:04:35] and and just get in one mind in one
[1:04:38] Accord and that one mind is in Christ
[1:04:42] now
[1:04:44] you don't have to work on emotions
[1:04:47] emotions come I'm an emotional person
[1:04:50] and when God touches me I can't help it
[1:04:52] I cry I shout I get all excited
[1:04:56] but I don't point to the emotion before
[1:04:59] the word the word comes and then the
[1:05:01] emotion amen don't get the card before
[1:05:04] the horse
[1:05:06] amen you see stimulation comes from
[1:05:09] revelation of the word
[1:05:11] not because the beat of the piano
[1:05:15] okay
[1:05:17] now again like I said it's a disclaimer
[1:05:22] most of the different ones that go to
[1:05:25] shouting and dancing
[1:05:27] usually come at the end of the service
[1:05:29] not during the word
[1:05:33] because the Beat of the Music
[1:05:36] is causing them to get excited it's not
[1:05:39] the ministering of the word
[1:05:43] they're being moved by the music
[1:05:47] and not by the word that was preached
[1:05:51] they're under the influence or the
[1:05:53] channel of music now who was the first
[1:05:55] one
[1:05:56] that brought music who was the first
[1:05:58] leader of Music in heaven
[1:06:01] Satan Lucifer
[1:06:03] and he is the maker of instruments of
[1:06:08] music so he knows how to worship
[1:06:11] so understand a lot of times what
[1:06:14] happens is you go to telling the people
[1:06:16] you've got to worship
[1:06:18] yeah but you Worship in spirit and
[1:06:21] true
[1:06:23] because there's a lot of worship that is
[1:06:25] called worship that is just emotion
[1:06:34] all right
[1:06:38] if
[1:06:42] now let me give you a personal testimony
[1:06:44] because I had a friend of mine a
[1:06:46] minister
[1:06:47] within the message
[1:06:51] his father was one of the very prominent
[1:06:53] minister of the message you would
[1:06:55] recognize his name but names are not
[1:06:58] important
[1:06:59] but he invited me he said brother Ron
[1:07:01] they're having a big Pentecostal
[1:07:02] movement
[1:07:04] in Beaumont Texas at that time I was
[1:07:06] living in Silsbee Texas he said would
[1:07:09] you like to come to with me to that
[1:07:12] movement tonight I thought well I I
[1:07:15] really you know I'm not interested
[1:07:17] really but if you want to go we'll we'll
[1:07:20] go and so uh
[1:07:25] yeah I wanted to demonstrate it
[1:07:30] anyway I'll just act like you
[1:07:34] you guys ever seen
[1:07:36] Mick Jagger and he grabs the microphone
[1:07:38] with the it's on the stand
[1:07:41] and they go to sing and
[1:07:43] I can't get no right
[1:07:46] and they go to and they got this and
[1:07:48] that well I went to this meeting and
[1:07:50] listen it was there was probably I want
[1:07:53] to estimate fifteen hundred two thousand
[1:07:55] people in the meeting and man before the
[1:07:58] service everybody hey Bob Hey Joe how
[1:08:00] you doing oh everybody talking and this
[1:08:02] and that all of a sudden
[1:08:04] um the drummer
[1:08:07] and everybody oh oh something's
[1:08:09] happening and then the guy gets up there
[1:08:13] I gotta do this this is
[1:08:22] praise God
[1:08:24] Hallelujah
[1:08:29] throws his long hair back
[1:08:32] everybody
[1:08:36] will be happy
[1:08:38] we'll be happy over there
[1:08:42] I turned to my buddy I said hey man hang
[1:08:45] on to your seat because this place is
[1:08:46] fixing to rock out
[1:08:50] everybody will be happy Hallelujah and
[1:08:53] he says
[1:08:56] time to get up it's I'm tired of dead
[1:08:58] churches I'm tired of a religion I can't
[1:09:01] feel oh and man everybody in this place
[1:09:03] went wild
[1:09:08] I thought my my
[1:09:13] everybody will be happy when we get over
[1:09:16] there
[1:09:17] you know who you who used to be really
[1:09:19] really good about getting everybody into
[1:09:21] the channel of Music Jimmy Swagger
[1:09:24] praise God
[1:09:25] little
[1:09:28] here on the keyboard oh my presence of
[1:09:31] God yeah when we get over there
[1:09:34] and the next thing you know he's talking
[1:09:35] to the people and what a golden voice if
[1:09:38] I could sing or preach like he's seen
[1:09:43] boy I'd win a lot of sauce
[1:09:50] now bro watch this what brother Branham
[1:09:52] says here in the sermon gifts
[1:09:55] 1956.
[1:10:00] that's what Abraham's seat does
[1:10:03] and if we being dead in Christ we take
[1:10:05] able on Abraham's seed and her heirs
[1:10:08] according to the promise
[1:10:10] then what kind of spirit should be in
[1:10:12] you
[1:10:14] I'm afraid friends
[1:10:15] as I talk to your pastor today churches
[1:10:18] get the pastor's spirit
[1:10:20] instead of God's spirit
[1:10:25] we don't need one another spirit
[1:10:28] there's no need of that we need God's
[1:10:31] spirit
[1:10:32] you go into a church and watch the way
[1:10:34] the passer acts watch the congregation
[1:10:37] act the same way
[1:10:41] I feel sorry for you guys because you
[1:10:43] know I'm
[1:10:46] I only get excited and run once in a
[1:10:49] while
[1:10:50] and David Cleveland intercepted me and
[1:10:52] almost tackled me when I went to running
[1:10:55] through the church you guys remember
[1:10:56] that
[1:10:58] I I do like to get excited and
[1:11:01] everything but listen you better give me
[1:11:02] something to get excited about or I'm
[1:11:04] just not just because everybody else
[1:11:08] now I was in a meeting in
[1:11:11] in Belgium
[1:11:14] one of the larger meetings I had been in
[1:11:16] a message convention
[1:11:19] and I saw
[1:11:21] I saw fanaticism that I've never seen
[1:11:24] before nor since
[1:11:29] and I saw people
[1:11:31] and everybody's standing up and while
[1:11:33] the preachers preaching men running up
[1:11:35] in front of the pulpit hallelujah praise
[1:11:38] God people getting all excited and I'm
[1:11:41] yeah
[1:11:42] and I'm trying to hear what he has to
[1:11:45] say
[1:11:46] but the screaming and the shouting was
[1:11:48] so great I couldn't really hear it and
[1:11:51] it was in English
[1:11:54] well I thought I'm not going to jump up
[1:11:58] and stand up just because everybody else
[1:12:00] is
[1:12:02] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[1:12:05] forever
[1:12:08] amen amen I'm in nothing wrong with it
[1:12:13] but don't you know that already
[1:12:17] is that something new
[1:12:23] I and saying the things that we already
[1:12:26] know
[1:12:28] I mean I'm going amen yes sir brother I
[1:12:30] believe that
[1:12:32] I'm not making fun of that but I'm just
[1:12:34] saying the fanatical so I had and I I'm
[1:12:38] just saying this I was there there was
[1:12:41] tons of people around me and they had
[1:12:44] this expression of
[1:12:46] of Jubilee and they say
[1:12:52] so
[1:12:53] I'm in this meeting
[1:12:55] and while the preachers preaching
[1:12:57] everything that he says and I'm looking
[1:13:00] around this brother he looks down at me
[1:13:01] and he goes
[1:13:05] well he everyone's standing I'm sitting
[1:13:09] and I misinterpreted what he said
[1:13:13] shuck
[1:13:16] your shocked
[1:13:18] he's sitting here seat in your sock
[1:13:22] he wasn't he was just saying
[1:13:25] whatever Jubilation whatever he said I
[1:13:28] misunderstood it and I thought boy this
[1:13:30] guy's pretty brash
[1:13:32] just because I don't jump up
[1:13:34] and everything well I saw a fanatical
[1:13:36] element there that I had never seen
[1:13:38] before nor after
[1:13:41] now brother Brown said I'm afraid what
[1:13:44] we do is we get one another spirit
[1:13:46] okay
[1:13:48] and what we need is the holy spirit now
[1:13:51] brother Branham said in the sermon God
[1:13:54] keeps his word 1957.
[1:13:57] Now talks about Ahab his lukewarm
[1:14:00] borderline backslidden Israelite
[1:14:03] he says I'm going to go to my
[1:14:05] highlighted part that's the reason
[1:14:06] coming into a meeting
[1:14:09] talk about uh taking one another's
[1:14:11] spirit
[1:14:13] coming into a meeting we like to stay
[1:14:15] right with the word stay with the word
[1:14:17] so the spirit of the word will be on the
[1:14:20] people not the spirit of some fantastic
[1:14:23] or some minister or something
[1:14:28] that we'd have to answer for at that day
[1:14:30] of judgment I want one thing I don't try
[1:14:32] to project something of my own
[1:14:35] my Fantastics into them people
[1:14:38] but I stay with God's word
[1:14:41] that's the kind of spirit you want
[1:14:43] something that'll take the word of God
[1:14:44] and not a bunch of Fantastics
[1:14:47] a bunch of Theology of man-made stay
[1:14:49] with God's word Eternal Word
[1:14:52] now
[1:14:55] I want you to understand brother Brennan
[1:14:56] makes up his own words
[1:14:59] he's saying watch these Fantastics what
[1:15:03] does he mean
[1:15:04] fanatics
[1:15:06] I got it
[1:15:09] so there are some quotes you go to what
[1:15:12] about these Fanatics and fanaticism you
[1:15:14] won't find it but he said Fantastics
[1:15:17] and how about another one he says
[1:15:19] indocumented
[1:15:22] it's because you're undocumented what
[1:15:25] does he mean
[1:15:26] indoctrinated
[1:15:30] umpire Empire
[1:15:32] come on
[1:15:34] but I love now I'll tell you what what I
[1:15:36] love about this message is it was no
[1:15:40] it was normal Showmanship
[1:15:43] it had no Flair
[1:15:45] he didn't get up on the piano
[1:15:48] he you know what I'm saying in fact when
[1:15:51] the Holy Spirit came
[1:15:53] watch we have 1100 1200 sermons to give
[1:15:59] you examples he's here now
[1:16:04] don't nobody move
[1:16:06] right whoa wait a second that's a whole
[1:16:09] lot different
[1:16:10] than what we're transforming people into
[1:16:15] okay because we want to get you
[1:16:18] to be able to
[1:16:22] let's say have an initial evidence in
[1:16:25] this hour
[1:16:27] just exactly like they did in the day of
[1:16:29] Pentecost with a Pentecostal Church
[1:16:32] excuse me
[1:16:34] what was Pentecost error in their
[1:16:37] doctrinal teaching it wasn't the
[1:16:39] anointing it wasn't the signs it wasn't
[1:16:42] the speaking in tongues
[1:16:44] it was they made speaking in tongues the
[1:16:46] evidence you got the Holy Spirit didn't
[1:16:49] matter the life they could cut their
[1:16:51] hair paint their nails wear immoral
[1:16:54] clothes they could do all that stuff
[1:16:55] losing the Simplicity that is in Christ
[1:17:00] are you understanding that
[1:17:02] and and so
[1:17:05] brother man shows watch this anointing
[1:17:07] and they get under one another's spirit
[1:17:10] and boy I'll tell you what the internet
[1:17:12] is filled right now with what is called
[1:17:16] Pentecost Apostolic and all kinds of
[1:17:19] stuff and and let me tell you you talk
[1:17:22] about dancing shouting running speaking
[1:17:25] in tongues and did you know speaking in
[1:17:29] tongues brother Branham said is a sign
[1:17:31] of impending disaster
[1:17:35] now I will address this later
[1:17:38] but the Apostle Paul says do all speak
[1:17:40] in tongues
[1:17:42] do all prophesy do all have the gifts of
[1:17:44] healing
[1:17:46] now I'll tell you what it's amazing we
[1:17:48] talk about tongues but
[1:17:50] where is the interpretation of tongues
[1:17:54] well I I'm just speaking edification
[1:17:57] unto the Lord because there is a tongue
[1:17:59] of man and tongue of angels I'm not here
[1:18:01] to talk about that but there is so much
[1:18:03] is put on evidence well I tell you what
[1:18:05] they're they're saying uh uh uh uh that
[1:18:08] you know forbid to speak in tongues no
[1:18:11] that's not it
[1:18:13] but what we're doing is if you're not
[1:18:15] teaching what brother Branham said in
[1:18:18] its entirety
[1:18:19] what you do is you you got to picture
[1:18:21] all messed up
[1:18:23] in fact
[1:18:25] when brother Brandon put Brenham
[1:18:27] Tabernacle in order
[1:18:30] and he made the gifts according to
[1:18:33] being judged
[1:18:37] what happened
[1:18:40] well let's do it in the back room
[1:18:43] oh you got the gift of tongues you got
[1:18:46] the gift of interpretation great praise
[1:18:48] God you're an elder
[1:18:50] we're going to get you guys in the back
[1:18:51] room meet here and let's pray let's seek
[1:18:54] God so you speak in tongues and you
[1:18:56] interpret
[1:18:57] then I ask the Elder what do you think
[1:18:58] what do you think what do you think
[1:19:00] I think it's God
[1:19:02] write it down
[1:19:04] now give it to the church
[1:19:09] thus say the spirit of God that spoke to
[1:19:11] us this morning
[1:19:13] thus and thus oh ye my people if you
[1:19:16] will seek my face I will bless you all
[1:19:18] stop that's nonsense
[1:19:21] we know that you seek God God will bless
[1:19:24] you you make a move towards God God will
[1:19:26] make a move towards you we know that
[1:19:29] prophecy is what
[1:19:31] for telling what
[1:19:33] a future event
[1:19:35] now if it doesn't have a future event
[1:19:38] if it doesn't have something that the
[1:19:41] spirit of God it says don't go home by
[1:19:43] way of I-10 today because it'll be a bad
[1:19:47] accident
[1:19:48] now watch this three Elders judged it
[1:19:51] and said this is God now what if it
[1:19:53] doesn't come to pass
[1:19:57] he said you got a lion Spirit among your
[1:19:59] church
[1:20:00] and he said don't this is the message
[1:20:04] he said then those who said it was of
[1:20:08] God they need to step down
[1:20:10] and he said even the tongue's an
[1:20:12] interpreter and everything he said
[1:20:13] because you got a lion Spirit among you
[1:20:15] so what caused Junior Jackson and Don
[1:20:19] ruddle to split from Brother Brown
[1:20:21] that's his sister churches
[1:20:24] when he said Branham Tabernacle in order
[1:20:29] they split
[1:20:30] because they wanted the gifts
[1:20:33] so just so you know a little bit of the
[1:20:36] history of that okay
[1:20:38] now watch this on the invasion of of the
[1:20:42] United States 1954
[1:20:45] let me persuade them to come to the
[1:20:48] altar well I better read because I think
[1:20:51] this is important God let me preach like
[1:20:54] I've never before
[1:20:55] let me preach you dying man as a dying
[1:20:58] man myself let me preach to the people
[1:21:00] like I've now like I have uh never have
[1:21:03] another sermon to preach
[1:21:06] let me persuade them to come to the
[1:21:08] altar with streaming
[1:21:10] faces with tears go back home and live
[1:21:13] like Christians
[1:21:15] so he's preaching the word and bring a
[1:21:18] conviction
[1:21:20] they repent and go what do they do they
[1:21:22] go back home
[1:21:23] and live
[1:21:25] in their neighborhood stop all to hear
[1:21:28] Frolic and run around jumping and
[1:21:29] carrying on acting this way and blowing
[1:21:32] up at this and going that way oh don't
[1:21:34] do that that's the devil
[1:21:37] them demon spirits come on
[1:21:40] Christians
[1:21:43] amazing
[1:21:45] you have all jumping and shouting but
[1:21:47] somebody disagree with you and you blow
[1:21:48] up something wrong
[1:21:51] huh
[1:21:53] 1950 again I said this is a disclaimer
[1:21:55] and people say well brother Ron you said
[1:21:57] this because then I stop
[1:22:00] okay
[1:22:02] 1954 again seven Church ages
[1:22:06] as long as we fuss and stew and carry on
[1:22:08] among one another
[1:22:10] we still walk as men
[1:22:12] until a man can get down at the altar
[1:22:14] and get right with God until he can
[1:22:17] Overlook little things and move on like
[1:22:18] a Christian ought
[1:22:20] can't call the kettle black
[1:22:23] right don't holler at them let's clean
[1:22:26] our steps first
[1:22:29] excuse us strangers
[1:22:31] I'm giving the church a little gospel
[1:22:33] spanking now
[1:22:35] or you say we got it
[1:22:38] and get up here and beat the piano as
[1:22:39] hard as it can go and bunch of drums and
[1:22:43] run up down the floor and go out and
[1:22:44] fuss with your neighbor
[1:22:47] have you got anything oh no no sir
[1:22:51] the only thing we got is a lukewarm
[1:22:54] as long as the music's running we're
[1:22:56] running
[1:22:59] When the Music Stops
[1:23:03] we stop
[1:23:07] God don't need that
[1:23:10] to move the church
[1:23:16] do you understand that
[1:23:19] a Revival is when God gives you
[1:23:22] Revelation and it brings a stimulation
[1:23:24] and the music is not you see we can use
[1:23:27] the channel of music that's okay I
[1:23:30] believe we help create an atmosphere but
[1:23:33] if we're not careful what happens is we
[1:23:36] will at the end of the service
[1:23:39] now
[1:23:41] it usually won't be a song of repentance
[1:23:45] search me o God
[1:23:50] and know my way today it'll not be a
[1:23:55] slow song
[1:23:57] it'll usually be something that's got a
[1:23:59] little bit of a beat I'm not against a
[1:24:00] Beat
[1:24:01] I like a beat I like something that's
[1:24:03] got a little snap to it
[1:24:05] but if we're not careful the people
[1:24:08] being moved
[1:24:10] okay because of the beat
[1:24:15] your internet is filled with
[1:24:19] this
[1:24:20] when the fire comes down the Holy Ghost
[1:24:23] Fire
[1:24:24] okay ow
[1:24:26] I am a Pentecostal
[1:24:29] I am doing what they did on the day of
[1:24:31] Acts
[1:24:32] I am a Pentecostal I have the
[1:24:35] firefighter in my bones I got five years
[1:24:40] right and the next thing everybody fire
[1:24:44] and everybody's moving to the music
[1:24:48] hey denominations are doing it
[1:24:52] man if they're not jumping and screaming
[1:24:55] and running around they haven't had a
[1:24:58] service
[1:25:00] imagine coming to brother branham's
[1:25:02] meeting
[1:25:03] and they're all one to have a runaway
[1:25:05] and brother Brian said no he's here now
[1:25:09] don't move
[1:25:12] we ought to be moving man why it's
[1:25:15] because you've been in documented
[1:25:21] okay because that's what you've been
[1:25:23] taught
[1:25:24] now
[1:25:29] I tell you
[1:25:31] we need an old-fashioned Revival like we
[1:25:34] used to have down in the country
[1:25:36] when they laid on their face all night
[1:25:38] not to carry on
[1:25:39] but real Godly sorrow
[1:25:42] not go back to the Altar and say but go
[1:25:44] out and make it right with the neighbors
[1:25:49] that they hadn't made it wrong with and
[1:25:52] get straightened up
[1:25:54] brother Ram said I believe in the holy
[1:25:56] spirit that brings a conviction that if
[1:25:58] you took a tool from your boss and you
[1:26:01] put it in your toolbox and it's not
[1:26:03] yours you're going to go back to him hey
[1:26:05] boss I'm sorry I took your tool
[1:26:08] he might fire me yeah well you stole
[1:26:11] this too
[1:26:13] that's the Holy Spirit conviction
[1:26:16] let us father live with the conviction
[1:26:20] by way of the Holy Spirit not because
[1:26:23] we're getting one another spirit
[1:26:26] okay
[1:26:30] I want to ask you if we've got 1100 1200
[1:26:34] sermons
[1:26:35] that's the example that we have before
[1:26:37] us
[1:26:39] then it concerns me as a minister of the
[1:26:42] Gospel seeing things being transformed
[1:26:45] into something that wasn't the way it
[1:26:46] was with brother Branham
[1:26:50] now you can hate me all you want you can
[1:26:53] say I'm an old-timer and I'm an old
[1:26:55] fuddy duddy and and uh I'm legalistic no
[1:26:58] I'm just saying hey why are we losing
[1:27:00] our simplicity
[1:27:07] when brother Brandon now watch his
[1:27:09] doctrinal teaching because he comes from
[1:27:11] the scripture
[1:27:13] the Bible says in first Timothy 5 and 22
[1:27:16] lay hands suddenly on no man
[1:27:20] neither be partakers of other men sins
[1:27:25] wow it's amazing
[1:27:28] now we're going to go into brother
[1:27:29] Brown's doctrinal teaching on the laying
[1:27:32] on of hands
[1:27:34] what does he say about it
[1:27:40] I'll give you an example now here in
[1:27:42] six-fold
[1:27:44] purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel
[1:27:47] I stood by the man sight of a man right
[1:27:50] over here in Port Fulton dying
[1:27:53] they called me to his bedside when I
[1:27:56] prayed with him here at the altar one
[1:27:58] night
[1:27:59] he put his arm around a woman
[1:28:02] I said take your arm from around that
[1:28:05] lady he said I'm leading her to God
[1:28:09] I said not your arm around her
[1:28:13] I don't believe in such stuff as that
[1:28:17] he got angry with me and stomped out the
[1:28:19] door
[1:28:21] I went to him a little later when he was
[1:28:23] dying he looked at me in the face and
[1:28:25] said Don't Pray For Me Brother Bill I'm
[1:28:27] lost I'm gone
[1:28:28] all I ever gained is done gone
[1:28:33] now here he was under an anointing at
[1:28:36] the altar and he's got his arm around a
[1:28:38] woman and brother REM said get your arm
[1:28:40] off her
[1:28:41] I'm leading her to cry not no no no I
[1:28:43] don't believe in such
[1:28:45] now here's his Doctrine on teaching I
[1:28:47] don't believe in such
[1:28:49] and here's another thing don't don't be
[1:28:51] so quick to lay hands on somebody if
[1:28:52] somebody comes down here to the Altar
[1:28:54] and they're crying let him cry it's good
[1:28:57] for him what happens if you break the
[1:28:59] shell of the chicken trying to break
[1:29:01] itself out
[1:29:02] you kill it
[1:29:08] look keep it simple you don't have to
[1:29:10] pray for everybody that comes forward
[1:29:12] no sometimes I'll tell you what I love
[1:29:14] it sometimes I love it that when a
[1:29:16] church service is dismissed and I've
[1:29:19] stayed in the Pew I've stayed there in
[1:29:22] my seat and I've wept before God and I
[1:29:25] had my own time with God and everybody
[1:29:27] was out of the sanctuary
[1:29:31] oh those times are so
[1:29:34] beautiful
[1:29:35] those are the times
[1:29:37] how about you home reading your Bible
[1:29:41] and you have a time where God comes down
[1:29:45] and the presence
[1:29:47] comes so sweetly and You Weep before God
[1:29:50] and you pour out your your spirit before
[1:29:54] him and you just make love to him and
[1:29:57] you just thank God or how many of you
[1:29:59] have been out in nature
[1:30:01] you weren't in a church service there
[1:30:03] was nobody there was no music
[1:30:05] but you're out there and all of a sudden
[1:30:07] you feel as God's presence you put your
[1:30:10] arms up oh God I remember I was running
[1:30:13] I used to try to run seven miles
[1:30:16] in the desert In the Heat of the day
[1:30:18] years ago
[1:30:20] young man
[1:30:23] and I will wait till the heat of the day
[1:30:25] until it's 115 degrees
[1:30:28] I have my sweatpants on and my t-shirt
[1:30:31] and I get out there and I just run
[1:30:33] across it then
[1:30:35] like this until I'm just pouring sweat
[1:30:38] and I stopped one time
[1:30:40] and I felt the presence of God and I
[1:30:42] looked around
[1:30:44] and everything every plant
[1:30:47] every
[1:30:51] all the
[1:30:53] the plants every saguaro cactus
[1:30:57] all of the out of nature around me I
[1:31:01] could see they all had their hands up
[1:31:03] and they were worshiping God
[1:31:06] did I break into a vision I don't know
[1:31:08] all I see is it seemed like all of
[1:31:11] nature around me was worshiping God and
[1:31:13] I had myself a jubilee
[1:31:16] brother Branham says
[1:31:18] of the times that he said if you ever
[1:31:20] catch me in the woods sometime
[1:31:24] and he says and I run and run around the
[1:31:26] tree any of you ever done that where you
[1:31:29] get so excited you run around a tree
[1:31:31] just praising God he said that little
[1:31:33] old chipmunk looking at me chatter
[1:31:35] chatter chatter
[1:31:37] days of Miracles are passed
[1:31:40] okay
[1:31:44] when's the last time you had a runaway
[1:31:47] and it wasn't among people you weren't
[1:31:49] getting one another Spirit you were
[1:31:50] getting the Holy Spirit
[1:31:52] and God revealing to you something
[1:31:55] amen keep it simple let the presence of
[1:31:58] God work on the hearts of the people let
[1:32:01] them be moved on by the Holy Spirit
[1:32:04] amen
[1:32:07] brother Brown said a greater than
[1:32:08] Solomon is here watch this
[1:32:13] now say for instance we got great faith
[1:32:16] and here stands a man on the platform
[1:32:20] all having a great time shouting in the
[1:32:23] glory of God around
[1:32:25] I said now maybe this man stole some
[1:32:28] money
[1:32:29] he'd lived evil
[1:32:31] maybe running around with some woman
[1:32:33] immorally he'd done a murder or
[1:32:35] something
[1:32:36] that God put this sickness on him you
[1:32:39] know God uses sickness for whips
[1:32:43] to bring us to him
[1:32:48] you ever heard that quote
[1:32:53] why are you so silent
[1:32:56] listen
[1:32:57] you notice prophetic gifts
[1:33:00] can get you in trouble
[1:33:02] certainly can
[1:33:04] what if this man's done something evil
[1:33:06] and I'm standing there great big what we
[1:33:08] call an America bulldog faith I grab a
[1:33:11] hold of him and say hallelujah
[1:33:13] hallelujah Satan turn him lose glory to
[1:33:16] God and I take that disease off him and
[1:33:19] God put it on him for a purpose I'm in
[1:33:22] trouble with God
[1:33:25] you see what I mean
[1:33:28] any of you ever heard teachings like
[1:33:30] this
[1:33:31] brother Brown said sometimes he said
[1:33:33] because you will suffer for your
[1:33:36] Disobedience and God allow us sickness
[1:33:39] he did that with Billy Paul
[1:33:41] do you remember when the age of the Lord
[1:33:44] come to Brethren him he said honey go to
[1:33:46] Billy Paul he's sick unto death runs
[1:33:49] into the hospital Billy Paul says Oh
[1:33:51] Daddy you're here pray for me he said I
[1:33:53] ain't praying for you what do you tell
[1:33:55] him
[1:34:00] say it loud enough they can hear it you
[1:34:03] do the do the prayer Billy you did the
[1:34:06] sin and you do the praying walked out
[1:34:09] Billy Paul tells the testimony he said
[1:34:12] The Darkest Day of My Life
[1:34:14] daddy refused to pray for me
[1:34:19] um
[1:34:21] sometimes saints of God it's not that
[1:34:23] somebody needs to pray for you you need
[1:34:25] to pray for yourself
[1:34:26] you need to get right with God
[1:34:29] you need to say oh God and be sincerely
[1:34:33] honest and sincere with God God allowed
[1:34:36] a sickness to bring you to him
[1:34:39] he might have broke the Good Shepherd
[1:34:41] might have broke the leg of the Lamb
[1:34:47] would a Good Shepherd do that
[1:34:49] sure he will
[1:34:51] so
[1:34:54] now
[1:34:58] brother Branham said now let's go on I'm
[1:35:00] gonna we're going into some doctrinal
[1:35:01] teaching and I've got I've got some time
[1:35:04] here but I I just want to take this
[1:35:06] slowly so you get it
[1:35:08] the sermon three Witnesses
[1:35:11] the Antichrist spirit is not communistic
[1:35:14] Spirit the Antichrist spirit is a
[1:35:17] religious spirit
[1:35:18] oh
[1:35:21] I have delivered my soul that's what God
[1:35:24] was wanting me to do right there amen
[1:35:28] he was a witness saying a religious
[1:35:30] spirit
[1:35:31] is an antichrist spirit
[1:35:34] now watch
[1:35:37] it was not the everyday common people
[1:35:40] who crucified Christ
[1:35:42] who was it that crucified Christ
[1:35:48] huh the religious people
[1:35:50] wasn't the everyday common sinner it was
[1:35:54] the religious people was it not Ishmael
[1:35:57] the Seed of Abraham that persecuted
[1:36:01] Isaac
[1:36:03] how old was Ishmael when Isaac was born
[1:36:07] 15 years old
[1:36:10] and he did make fun of Isaac
[1:36:14] I want you to understand brother Branham
[1:36:17] Abraham Branham
[1:36:20] comes to the Pentecostal woman Hagar
[1:36:22] denomination first
[1:36:25] he says I've sent five hundred thousand
[1:36:28] of my converts
[1:36:32] to the Pentecostal church if I didn't
[1:36:35] believe in going to church
[1:36:37] do you think I would be deceiving to
[1:36:39] send them to go to a church
[1:36:41] but watch this
[1:36:44] those didn't they weren't it was the
[1:36:47] right seed wrong woman
[1:36:51] because when you get the right seed in
[1:36:54] Sarah
[1:36:55] you don't have this this desire to look
[1:36:59] down and put everybody else down to make
[1:37:01] yourself look good
[1:37:03] those are drowning preachers
[1:37:07] pushing everybody else down to keep
[1:37:09] themselves up let me tell you brother
[1:37:11] Brennan this is what I love about the
[1:37:13] message
[1:37:15] it was so simple
[1:37:17] he never pushed himself up he never
[1:37:19] propagated his own gift
[1:37:22] he uh
[1:37:24] I love it in fact I love to hear his
[1:37:27] voice
[1:37:28] it's so simple
[1:37:30] now
[1:37:36] invasion of the United States for the
[1:37:38] Iran the Antichrist is very religious
[1:37:40] very religious
[1:37:41] it was a religious spirit that crucified
[1:37:43] Jesus it's always been a religious world
[1:37:46] of religious people that crucifies it's
[1:37:49] a religious people that was against the
[1:37:51] true Christ it was the religious
[1:37:53] prophets that was against Micaiah
[1:37:56] it's the religious people of the day
[1:37:58] that's against the message of God
[1:38:02] wow
[1:38:04] I wonder how many ishmaelites we have
[1:38:06] within the message
[1:38:09] I'm just asking you
[1:38:11] because if you don't see it the way that
[1:38:13] they see it they'll persecute you
[1:38:16] he said in the bride of Christ is no
[1:38:19] guile
[1:38:20] there's nothing in there bride cannot
[1:38:23] persecute right
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:28] it's not in them
[1:38:30] they humble themselves oh God oh God
[1:38:32] don't let me look at others let me look
[1:38:34] at myself God judge me
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:40] seal of the Antichrist 55 borderline
[1:38:42] halfway watch that religious spirit you
[1:38:44] say brother random do you mean to tell
[1:38:46] me the Antichrist spirit will be a
[1:38:48] religious spirit
[1:38:49] Jesus said it'd be so close like the
[1:38:51] real thing till it would deceive the
[1:38:53] very elect if possible Matthew 24.
[1:38:56] that throws a little different light to
[1:38:58] it doesn't it it's a religious spirit a
[1:39:01] spirit that can shout a spirit that can
[1:39:03] dance in the spirit a spirit that can
[1:39:05] cast out Devils a spirit can do all
[1:39:07] kinds of Miracles and still not be born
[1:39:09] of the spirit of God
[1:39:12] whoa
[1:39:15] and that day many will come to me and
[1:39:17] say Lord Lord have we not cast out
[1:39:19] devils in thy name
[1:39:22] in your name haven't I done Mighty works
[1:39:25] and I will confess unto them depart from
[1:39:28] me you workers of iniquity I don't even
[1:39:30] know you
[1:39:34] do you know that false prophets and
[1:39:36] false teachers rule over the People by
[1:39:37] fear
[1:39:39] teach them to to fear them you leave my
[1:39:42] church I'll tell you what
[1:39:44] you have left God and God's Gonna judge
[1:39:46] your I'll stop brother Brenham never
[1:39:50] got you to fear Him
[1:39:58] look it was not Janice and jambres
[1:40:01] that affected the children of Israel
[1:40:03] that was back in denominational Egypt it
[1:40:06] was the dathens and chorus
[1:40:09] within the message and they said Moses
[1:40:11] takes too much authority to himself are
[1:40:14] we not all children of God don't we all
[1:40:16] have the spirit of God why Moses who
[1:40:19] made you a judge over us
[1:40:23] God hiding himself in Simplicity in fact
[1:40:26] the sermon before the opening of the
[1:40:28] seals
[1:40:30] why can't people believe in the simple
[1:40:32] Simplicity of a humble bunch of people
[1:40:35] and the voice of the signs of God why
[1:40:37] can't they believe it
[1:40:39] the true word of God being made manifest
[1:40:41] they're too smart too educated to
[1:40:44] believe the simple form of the written
[1:40:45] word
[1:40:47] amen they want to put their own
[1:40:48] interpretation to it it don't mean this
[1:40:50] it don't mean that see it does mean that
[1:40:53] listen may I say this right quick now
[1:40:56] even the visions that God gives here at
[1:40:58] the place it's so misunderstood that's
[1:41:01] the reason you hear me say on the tapes
[1:41:03] say what the tapes say say what
[1:41:06] divisions say
[1:41:08] smart educational miss it the simple
[1:41:11] Visions when they're revealed in such
[1:41:13] Simplicity till it crosses over the top
[1:41:16] of the people's head
[1:41:18] listen may I share with you and
[1:41:20] understand this you all know that Sandy
[1:41:23] and I went over to Europe from 84 to 89
[1:41:26] and our pastor Floyd Patterson who took
[1:41:29] over spoken word publication
[1:41:32] when Roy borders died
[1:41:34] my pastor sent me over to Europe to open
[1:41:37] a spoken word office first one anywhere
[1:41:40] in the united excuse me anywhere outside
[1:41:42] the United States anywhere in the world
[1:41:45] so we went over there we opened up a
[1:41:47] spoken word office a year and a half
[1:41:49] later Joseph Branham took over
[1:41:52] spoken word publication and changed the
[1:41:55] name to what
[1:41:57] voice of God
[1:41:59] so now he combined the tapes and the
[1:42:02] books together
[1:42:04] okay and
[1:42:07] um
[1:42:07] so uh I want you to understand
[1:42:13] the Viewpoint the voice of God
[1:42:15] Recordings makes
[1:42:18] on just saying listen to the tapes
[1:42:21] I I understand some of that
[1:42:24] why
[1:42:27] because they have seen every fanatical
[1:42:29] element
[1:42:31] they have seen every kind of ism they
[1:42:33] have seen every Minister get up and try
[1:42:35] to pull off a group of people whether
[1:42:37] it's Thunders or whether it's Perugia or
[1:42:40] whether it's deity or whether it's
[1:42:42] five-fold Ministry and it's all of these
[1:42:45] different isms and they're all planted
[1:42:47] on the same tree the crafted in Vines
[1:42:50] the crafted in branches of the message
[1:42:52] living off of the same message
[1:42:58] my
[1:43:02] laughs so I do I
[1:43:06] I can under understand Joseph's
[1:43:08] Viewpoint stay with those tapes why he's
[1:43:12] seen them he said brother Ron I'll share
[1:43:14] with you something he told me very
[1:43:16] personal very personal
[1:43:18] he said how would you like
[1:43:20] he said Daddy just died Mama's in the
[1:43:22] hospital Sarah's in the hospital
[1:43:25] and I'm in the home
[1:43:27] and two or three men I forget if he said
[1:43:29] if it was three but I know at least two
[1:43:31] he said they come into my home
[1:43:36] and he says and they kneel in front of
[1:43:37] me and call me Lord Joseph
[1:43:43] he said what would that do to your 10
[1:43:45] year old
[1:43:46] mine
[1:43:49] how old are you boys you and the orange
[1:43:52] jacket how old are you
[1:43:54] 12.
[1:43:56] imagine if you were 10 years old
[1:43:58] and somebody comes and makes you Lord
[1:44:01] Joseph
[1:44:03] what would you do you go
[1:44:05] wow
[1:44:07] you would think
[1:44:08] what's wrong with these guys
[1:44:10] and see all kinds of the fanatical
[1:44:13] elements that's why I understand Brother
[1:44:15] Joseph said there's one voice ordained
[1:44:18] of God to turn your hearts back
[1:44:21] it's true I believe that but I also
[1:44:25] believe that God's got a god ordained
[1:44:27] God equipped God called man
[1:44:29] who are part of the fivefold ministry
[1:44:31] because it didn't end with the with the
[1:44:34] voice of Malachi 4 or Revelations 10 7
[1:44:38] The Voice continues
[1:44:44] but I understand the viewpoint
[1:44:49] now let me show you what happened in the
[1:44:51] early church
[1:44:53] you all know
[1:44:55] that after Acts chapter 2 it wasn't just
[1:44:58] a a period of time until the early
[1:45:02] church the Ephesian church with the Holy
[1:45:05] Spirit
[1:45:07] in fact they start choosing men to to
[1:45:09] take positions the first time Holy Ghost
[1:45:13] men chose lots and voted for somebody
[1:45:18] he said they voted the in the wrong man
[1:45:20] what was his name
[1:45:23] Matthias did he do anything for God
[1:45:26] he said man chose Matthias and he said
[1:45:30] God chose Paul
[1:45:32] showing that even Holy Ghost filled man
[1:45:34] the first time they ever voted
[1:45:36] brother Ram said this voting in and
[1:45:38] voting out
[1:45:40] he said watch when God calls a man
[1:45:42] whether you voted for him or not
[1:45:46] God still made him a pastor he said
[1:45:48] watch Elijah whether Jezebel received
[1:45:51] him or not he was still her pastor
[1:45:57] okay
[1:45:58] now watch this in Galatians 1. I'm going
[1:46:02] to show you from the scriptures
[1:46:03] Galatians 1. I Marvel
[1:46:07] that there are that ye are so soon
[1:46:09] removed from him that is called you know
[1:46:12] the grace of Christ onto another gospel
[1:46:16] which is not another but there are some
[1:46:18] that trouble you
[1:46:20] and would pervert the gospel of Christ
[1:46:22] and though we are an angel from heaven
[1:46:25] preach any other gospel unto you than
[1:46:27] which we have preached unto you let him
[1:46:29] be accursed
[1:46:32] as we said before and I say now again
[1:46:35] If any man preach any other gospel
[1:46:39] unto you then what you've received
[1:46:41] letting be accursed
[1:46:46] now I've I've got several quotes here
[1:46:49] that I wish to kind of launch off
[1:46:53] into my next sermon
[1:46:56] remember we're talking about transformed
[1:46:58] ministers
[1:47:00] that transform themselves as Ministers
[1:47:03] of light
[1:47:05] over there in Holland if any of you
[1:47:08] speak Dutch
[1:47:09] or you're from Belgium
[1:47:12] a match when you like to light a match
[1:47:14] it's called Lucifer
[1:47:17] do you have a Lucifer
[1:47:20] strike a match why it's a bringer of
[1:47:22] light
[1:47:24] Now understand they transform themselves
[1:47:27] as apostles
[1:47:30] it wasn't God doing it they they said
[1:47:33] they're Apostles oh you're an apostle
[1:47:37] we have
[1:47:38] judged those who call themselves
[1:47:40] Apostles and are not
[1:47:44] why they get off the word
[1:47:48] okay now understand yet this is not a
[1:47:51] sermon you're gonna all jump and shout
[1:47:52] and get all excited no no no this is
[1:47:55] this is something that's going to found
[1:47:57] you why this is something that's going
[1:48:00] to put a foundation on you that when
[1:48:02] something comes by with a little
[1:48:05] fantastical
[1:48:07] our little in documention you you Hey
[1:48:11] listen I don't know about you but I'm
[1:48:12] skeptical
[1:48:15] brother REM said pastors by Nature are
[1:48:18] skeptical
[1:48:22] can't help it
[1:48:24] just my nature a little skeptical I'm a
[1:48:26] hard Sail
[1:48:29] women easy
[1:48:31] I got the best vacuum in the world man
[1:48:33] I'll tell you what let me just just come
[1:48:34] over here you know come here look at
[1:48:37] this man you need this vacuum I don't
[1:48:38] care 1200 bucks but it's the best you'll
[1:48:41] never have to buy another one in your
[1:48:43] life
[1:48:44] foreign
[1:48:47] are you kidding me
[1:48:52] hard sale I'm a hard sale are you
[1:48:55] look
[1:48:57] a woman is easy
[1:49:03] man's not
[1:49:05] brother Brown let me give you another
[1:49:06] doctrinal teaching he said you have a
[1:49:09] meeting going on and all kinds of and
[1:49:11] there's some kind of fanatical and
[1:49:13] Fantastical stuff going on phenomena and
[1:49:16] anointing is there he says watch when
[1:49:18] you've got women coming to the altar
[1:49:20] it's usually human emotion
[1:49:23] he said but when you get men
[1:49:27] he said when you get men to the altar
[1:49:29] it's because the word convicted them
[1:49:32] amen
[1:49:34] not making fun of the sisters
[1:49:36] no no no
[1:49:38] brother Brandon first sermon he ever
[1:49:39] preached right
[1:49:42] remember Dr Roy Davis
[1:49:44] Brothers I get up here and he says and I
[1:49:47] talked about Christ and he cried and
[1:49:49] they cried and we all cried and he said
[1:49:51] so Dr Davis he comes he's back in the
[1:49:54] back office how'd I do man
[1:49:57] give me an estimation the worst sermon I
[1:49:59] ever heard
[1:50:02] but they cried
[1:50:05] they cry at funerals they cry at
[1:50:07] weddings
[1:50:09] it's hard enough for me really
[1:50:12] I'm the minister I'm standing there I
[1:50:14] got my Bible and the bride comes down
[1:50:16] and she's got her veil and it's so holy
[1:50:19] and it's just and I think oh God here's
[1:50:21] Christ in the church
[1:50:23] I get emotional
[1:50:26] they cry at everything
[1:50:29] it's not the crying
[1:50:32] he says why he said just like you he he
[1:50:35] said like a lawyer that gets up there
[1:50:36] ladies and gentlemen of the jury I'm
[1:50:39] going to prove to you before this this
[1:50:41] uh uh judicial hearing is over I'm gonna
[1:50:45] prove to you that this guy is
[1:50:47] he is guilty on on like this
[1:50:52] beat on the banister and everybody whoo
[1:50:56] he said all that all that emotion he
[1:50:58] said had nothing to do with the legalism
[1:51:00] of the word
[1:51:05] anyway
[1:51:06] watch this and I'm bringing this to a
[1:51:09] close and yet I'm not closing
[1:51:12] I'm just causing you to relax
[1:51:15] you're getting a little tight
[1:51:19] 1962 testimony on the sea
[1:51:22] that's a reason I've been trying to keep
[1:51:24] the message just as simple
[1:51:28] as possible
[1:51:30] maybe some of you might be wondering why
[1:51:32] I'm not calling prayer lines each night
[1:51:34] here's my purpose
[1:51:36] in doing this I want to build faith in
[1:51:38] the people in a resurrected Jesus
[1:51:40] so you don't have to wait till some
[1:51:42] special gift passes through the
[1:51:44] neighborhood
[1:51:45] you just believe him wherever you are
[1:51:47] because he's God
[1:51:48] it doesn't take an evangelist hands
[1:51:52] which that's all right
[1:51:54] contending for the faith 1955.
[1:51:57] I have noticed so much in my meetings
[1:51:59] going around
[1:52:01] that the phenomenal
[1:52:03] phenomena of this way of the holy spirit
[1:52:05] moves and the meetings has been very
[1:52:07] strange to the American people
[1:52:10] because there's such a mix up among the
[1:52:13] American people
[1:52:15] so many different denominations so many
[1:52:18] different phases of which
[1:52:20] way they believe
[1:52:22] and they become so indocumented there's
[1:52:24] that word
[1:52:25] and documented with their belief till
[1:52:28] they hardly know which way to go
[1:52:31] if there ever was a place that really
[1:52:33] has become a modern Babylon it's America
[1:52:38] contending for the faith
[1:52:41] paragraph 12
[1:52:43] it isn't personal contact
[1:52:46] the minister isn't to personally contact
[1:52:50] the one thing that hurts the American
[1:52:52] people and for my own Ministry
[1:52:55] they believe they must have hands laid
[1:52:58] on them or something on that manner
[1:53:00] because they've been taught that
[1:53:02] especially among Full Gospel people
[1:53:07] wow
[1:53:08] amazing nazri Pilgrim Holiness Methodist
[1:53:12] Baptist so forth believe in the
[1:53:14] anointing of the oil
[1:53:15] that's the way they've been taught
[1:53:18] in foreign countries one thing in the
[1:53:20] Supernatural the whole group believes in
[1:53:21] one Accord because they're not
[1:53:24] undocumented with different things they
[1:53:26] just see it and what's got to be
[1:53:27] Supernatural they accept it in the way
[1:53:29] it is
[1:53:30] they don't class it to nothing else
[1:53:35] what does a prophet teach for Doctrine
[1:53:39] his meetings his services
[1:53:42] were for us an example
[1:53:45] brother Brenda's Ministry like I said
[1:53:48] was coming to such a crescendo now watch
[1:53:51] this
[1:53:53] prior to this brother Brenham is trying
[1:53:56] to wean the people away
[1:53:58] from the false teachings of Pentecost
[1:54:02] 1954 earnestly contending for the faith
[1:54:07] the American people are taught different
[1:54:10] than what the overseas people are over
[1:54:12] in there we're taught you must lay hands
[1:54:15] on the sick for them to recover
[1:54:17] as long as your mind is dealing that way
[1:54:21] nothing else short of that will do it
[1:54:24] that's right
[1:54:26] it's always something that's your point
[1:54:28] of contact
[1:54:33] in the sermon the True Vine and a false
[1:54:35] Vine
[1:54:36] 1955.
[1:54:39] my Ministry the reason it isn't so
[1:54:41] effective now he's talking about his own
[1:54:44] god-given
[1:54:46] Angel Vindicated Ministry of God
[1:54:51] the reason
[1:54:53] that my Ministry Isn't So effective I
[1:54:56] suppose in America is because the
[1:54:58] American people are very anxious for you
[1:55:01] to lay hands on them
[1:55:03] why
[1:55:05] that's the way they're preached to
[1:55:09] the way they've been
[1:55:11] documented
[1:55:12] another one of them words
[1:55:15] they've been documented
[1:55:18] that's a Jewish
[1:55:20] tradition
[1:55:22] just only a tradition
[1:55:29] do you now believe
[1:55:31] Macon Georgia in 1955.
[1:55:35] that works all right especially in
[1:55:36] America
[1:55:37] has been taught most of the people
[1:55:39] laying hands on the sick
[1:55:42] that's a Jewish custom it's all right
[1:55:45] it's the scripture
[1:55:48] some places in the scripture they're
[1:55:49] commanded to lay hands on the sick they
[1:55:52] shall recover another place they must
[1:55:54] anoint them with oil and a prayer of
[1:55:56] facial save the sick another place they
[1:55:58] cast out evil spirits and you just see
[1:56:00] it all around it's according to your
[1:56:02] faith be it unto you
[1:56:04] I said the other night Jesus said come
[1:56:06] lay your hands on my girl she'll live
[1:56:09] you believe you're just what you say you
[1:56:11] are seize come lay your hands on my girl
[1:56:13] she will live but the Roman
[1:56:15] not so
[1:56:17] speak the word
[1:56:20] I'm not worthy to come around my place
[1:56:22] for you to come around my place you just
[1:56:25] speak the word my servant shall live
[1:56:26] it's according to your faith what
[1:56:28] happened
[1:56:31] musicians go ahead and come this morning
[1:56:33] please
[1:56:37] the arrow of God's Deliverance
[1:56:41] shot from a bow
[1:56:48] the reason my Ministry has never been a
[1:56:51] good success in America
[1:56:54] in America the people are taught you got
[1:56:56] to lay hands on them
[1:57:00] you got to anoint him with oil
[1:57:02] that's what they believe
[1:57:04] and there's no way ever moving that
[1:57:10] see it's already grounded into them
[1:57:16] and you can't do nothing
[1:57:18] about it
[1:57:21] now if the people have been indocumented
[1:57:26] and it's what they've been taught
[1:57:27] brother Ren said you can't move them
[1:57:28] from it
[1:57:30] but I want to ask you
[1:57:33] brother Ram said don't major on a minor
[1:57:39] he said it was a Jewish tradition lay
[1:57:41] hands
[1:57:42] so what he said say what he says on tape
[1:57:47] Jewish tradition he said but to the
[1:57:50] Gentiles
[1:57:53] speak the word Lord
[1:57:56] whatever you say
[1:57:58] you don't need to come to my house you
[1:58:00] don't need to lay hands it's whatever
[1:58:02] you say
[1:58:05] you see with us Gentiles we've been
[1:58:07] trying to be weaned away from all of
[1:58:10] this stuff that we need to lay hands I
[1:58:12] believe on laying on of hands lay hands
[1:58:15] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:58:17] but the Bible also says don't lay hands
[1:58:20] on no man suddenly
[1:58:23] the sickness that he's got did God put
[1:58:26] it on him
[1:58:28] if it did and you come there and you
[1:58:30] cast it off and guess what the spirit
[1:58:33] will go
[1:58:34] and if that person has not repented
[1:58:38] guess what he goes out gets
[1:58:41] seven others much worse and comes back
[1:58:45] into the house and the house having been
[1:58:48] swept and garnished
[1:58:50] and he said but not filled
[1:58:53] he said that
[1:58:55] I got some quotes I'm going to show you
[1:58:57] brother Ram said you try to drag
[1:59:00] somebody to the altar because the spirit
[1:59:02] of God's moving on him he said and you
[1:59:05] are doing it by you pulling them he said
[1:59:07] it'll be ten times harder next time
[1:59:11] because they just Harden their spirit
[1:59:13] okay
[1:59:15] because you're doing it through the
[1:59:17] human emotion
[1:59:19] when God begins to convict the heart you
[1:59:22] can't brother Ram said a team of horses
[1:59:25] cannot keep you in your seat there'll be
[1:59:29] something you'll just oh God I need to
[1:59:31] make it right
[1:59:33] because there's a conviction
[1:59:36] as I gave you that quote he said Lord if
[1:59:39] this is let me preach as a dying
[1:59:41] minister to a dying people
[1:59:44] let me preach as though this is my last
[1:59:47] sermon
[1:59:49] and he says and get those people
[1:59:52] that they might repent and come to the
[1:59:54] altar with their tears streaming
[1:59:57] brother Brown said you want to get
[1:59:58] healed he said make it right with God
[2:00:02] healing is the children's bread
[2:00:05] is that right
[2:00:07] he said don't come up here confess your
[2:00:09] faults before you come up make it right
[2:00:11] then you have a right to receive healing
[2:00:14] amen those are doctrinal teaching
[2:00:18] and like I said a disclaimer hey and
[2:00:21] don't nobody think I'm shooting at it no
[2:00:24] I'm taking it from the message
[2:00:27] I may brother say that because that's
[2:00:29] the way I believe no stop
[2:00:32] he said it he had a gift
[2:00:36] and he said oh my my own Ministry
[2:00:40] he said it's never really been
[2:00:42] successful here in America
[2:00:44] because they've been undocumented
[2:00:47] he said I try to turn them
[2:00:50] he said but you know what if that's what
[2:00:52] they've been taught
[2:00:54] and so I've got to to learn if that's
[2:00:57] what people have been taught I can't I
[2:01:00] can't turn them
[2:01:02] but I believe saints of God that that
[2:01:04] third pull
[2:01:06] he says you watch that third pull
[2:01:09] watch he said when the persecution comes
[2:01:13] down he said watch what you've seen
[2:01:15] temporarily come in the fullness of its
[2:01:18] power
[2:01:19] I want to ask you the third pull every
[2:01:21] one of the five indications of the third
[2:01:24] pull was it done in church
[2:01:29] where was it done
[2:01:31] it was sovereignly given
[2:01:34] could be sitting around a table and
[2:01:36] brother Brennan's talking about
[2:01:38] squirrels
[2:01:42] and Hattie Wright believes and she comes
[2:01:44] under that anointing and she says these
[2:01:47] keywords that's nothing but the truth
[2:01:52] wasn't in church
[2:01:54] wasn't while he's preaching
[2:02:00] or they're out fishing a little fishing
[2:02:03] he's out fishing catches little fish he
[2:02:06] pulls the guts out he didn't take the
[2:02:08] hook the hook was so far down deep into
[2:02:11] it he didn't take the needle nose pliers
[2:02:13] and reach in there angelically he just
[2:02:15] pulled it out little fish
[2:02:18] insights came out he said you shot your
[2:02:21] last wide little fish throws it in the
[2:02:24] water and sit there and floats
[2:02:29] all of a sudden he feels the presence of
[2:02:31] God he said there's a resurrection going
[2:02:34] to take place
[2:02:36] wow maybe I'm going to go to the
[2:02:38] hospital
[2:02:39] maybe I'll go to Louisville
[2:02:41] I'll empty the hospital's out I'll pray
[2:02:43] for all the sick and they'll come out he
[2:02:45] said no speak to the little fish
[2:02:48] now if you and I would have been there
[2:02:52] and we'd have seen that we'd have
[2:02:54] thought
[2:02:55] oh the little fishy really wasn't dead
[2:02:59] he just floated around a little bit and
[2:03:01] swallowed his guts and backed down he
[2:03:02] went
[2:03:06] God does things supernaturally and he
[2:03:08] might do something so simple
[2:03:11] that we Overlook it
[2:03:14] because man's looking for some great
[2:03:16] some big something and he said and he
[2:03:19] said as an example he said here I've got
[2:03:21] a gift
[2:03:23] I'm to preach to the people I'll get the
[2:03:25] people to believe have a prayer line
[2:03:26] have him come up here and that woman
[2:03:29] sitting there wanting to pray for that
[2:03:30] little baby
[2:03:33] and three or four times it's so great
[2:03:35] honor go pray for that baby no brother
[2:03:38] rev's gonna do it who am I finally she
[2:03:41] can't so she's she's nudged by the
[2:03:44] spirit three or four times oh God help
[2:03:46] us be sensitive to your spirit
[2:03:48] she goes do you mind if I pray for your
[2:03:51] baby I just as a mother would she just
[2:03:54] felt some She lays her hands on a baby
[2:03:56] prays for it she goes and sits back down
[2:03:59] the lady doesn't get out of the prayer
[2:04:01] line she doesn't know what's happened to
[2:04:03] her baby and she comes up there and
[2:04:05] brother round said oh there's nothing
[2:04:07] wrong with your baby
[2:04:08] your baby is fine in fact when that
[2:04:13] sister got up and prayed for your baby
[2:04:15] God healed your baby
[2:04:21] let's keep it simple Saints
[2:04:24] let's keep this message so simple
[2:04:26] okay not something that we have to work
[2:04:29] on no no no no no hey you know what
[2:04:33] it's between you and God
[2:04:36] right it's between you and God I want to
[2:04:39] ask you how's your how's your life
[2:04:40] between you and God right now
[2:04:46] are you doing all that you know you
[2:04:48] should do if not it's iniquity and
[2:04:51] because iniquity abounds the love of
[2:04:53] many were what
[2:04:54] well that's called
[2:04:56] you wonder why some people's lives wax
[2:04:58] cold why the children don't want to do
[2:05:00] what my mom and dad mom and dad are just
[2:05:02] you know what they've waxed cold
[2:05:05] they're not fervent about the word they
[2:05:07] don't love God they don't enjoy even
[2:05:09] going to church they don't enjoy what
[2:05:11] they believe they're just persevering
[2:05:14] and I'll tell you what young kids don't
[2:05:16] want just some kind of persevering
