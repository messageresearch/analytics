[58:28] I'm going to venture out this morning
[58:31] okay
[58:32] I'm gonna venture out a little bit this
[58:35] morning I want to show you
[58:36] now you all know that job was a mighty
[58:39] man of God
[58:41] he went through many afflictions many
[58:44] afflictions
[58:46] and he lost everything that he had
[58:50] and yet
[58:51] God said have you considered my servant
[58:54] job
[58:55] amen
[58:57] and it came to the place where job was
[59:01] wondering I cursed the day that I was
[59:03] born
[59:04] why did I come forth from my mother's
[59:08] womb
[59:09] I should have never taken a breath
[59:12] and everything so what God did is God
[59:14] comes down and he gives him solace
[59:21] so he takes him
[59:23] to familiar places
[59:35] oh God
[59:39] I am here this morning
[59:42] I'm shaking
[59:45] I'm under expectation of what you're
[59:48] going to say to your people
[59:50] I pray now
[59:51] give us the anointing of the word o God
[59:55] let us go beyond
[59:57] what we can understand with the carnal
[1:00:00] mind but may there be a supernatural
[1:00:02] element come down Among Us and strike
[1:00:05] each and every one of our hearts
[1:00:09] I thank you and I Praise You reveal
[1:00:12] thyself o God for Christ
[1:00:15] is the mystery of God revealed come now
[1:00:19] we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen Job
[1:00:23] 38
[1:00:26] verses 1 through 7.
[1:00:31] and the Lord answered job
[1:00:34] out of the Whirlwind and said
[1:00:38] who is this that darkeneth counsel by
[1:00:41] words without knowledge
[1:00:45] grit up now that I loins like a man
[1:00:51] for I will demand of Thee
[1:00:54] and answer thou me
[1:00:59] where was thou when I laid the
[1:01:01] foundation of the Earth
[1:01:03] declare of thou Hast understanding
[1:01:08] who hath laid the measures thereof
[1:01:11] if thou knowest
[1:01:13] or who hath stretched the line upon it
[1:01:19] whereupon are the foundations that are
[1:01:21] of fastened or who laid the Cornerstone
[1:01:26] her up
[1:01:28] and when the morning
[1:01:30] Stars sang together
[1:01:33] and all the sons of God
[1:01:36] shouted
[1:01:38] for joy
[1:01:41] turn with me to Proverbs chapter 8.
[1:01:52] he told job gird up your loins
[1:01:57] I'm going to talk to you
[1:02:00] and I demand an answer
[1:02:03] Proverbs 8 verses 21 through 31.
[1:02:11] that I may cause those that love me to
[1:02:14] inherit substance
[1:02:17] and I will fill their Treasures
[1:02:21] the Lord possessed me in the beginning
[1:02:24] of his way
[1:02:27] before his works of old
[1:02:30] I was set up from Everlasting
[1:02:34] from the beginning or ever the Earth was
[1:02:39] when there was no depths
[1:02:42] I was brought forth when there was no
[1:02:45] fountains abounding with water
[1:02:49] before the mountains were settled
[1:02:52] before the Hills
[1:02:54] was I brought forth
[1:02:57] while I was yet
[1:02:58] he that had not made the Earth nor the
[1:03:01] fields nor the highest part of the Dust
[1:03:04] of the world
[1:03:06] when he prepared the heavens
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:15] when he prepared the heavens I was there
[1:03:22] when he said a compass upon the face of
[1:03:25] the depth when he established the clouds
[1:03:28] above
[1:03:30] when he strengthened The Fountains of
[1:03:32] the deep when he gave to the Sea his
[1:03:35] decree
[1:03:37] that the water should not pass the
[1:03:40] Commandment
[1:03:41] when he appointed the foundations of the
[1:03:43] Earth
[1:03:45] then
[1:03:46] I was by him
[1:03:49] as one brought up with him
[1:03:53] I was daily his Delight
[1:03:59] rejoicing always before him
[1:04:03] rejoicing it in the habitable part of
[1:04:07] the earth and my Delights
[1:04:10] werewith
[1:04:13] the sons of men
[1:04:15] may God add the blessing to his word you
[1:04:18] may be seated this morning in his
[1:04:20] presence
[1:04:21] Hallelujah I want to title my sermon
[1:04:24] this morning I want to get right into it
[1:04:28] I want to title it familiar places
[1:04:33] and I want to take a subject this
[1:04:35] morning where were you
[1:04:45] now the world is as you all know it in a
[1:04:48] identity crisis
[1:04:51] when we have some of the most
[1:04:54] intelligent people upon the face of the
[1:04:57] Earth cannot Define a woman or a man
[1:05:01] foreign
[1:05:02] they are in an identity crisis
[1:05:07] a gender crisis
[1:05:11] we have
[1:05:12] entered now into what I call a global
[1:05:15] epidemic
[1:05:17] with a disease
[1:05:19] that I want to call as what the prophet
[1:05:22] called it severe
[1:05:24] amnesia
[1:05:33] it is an identity crisis
[1:05:37] brother Branham says you do not get your
[1:05:40] identity from your mother
[1:05:43] you get it from your father
[1:05:49] the devil is the author of confusion
[1:05:54] he is the ruler
[1:05:56] of this world
[1:05:58] but it's a temporary ownership that's
[1:06:01] right
[1:06:04] now how many know where the greatest
[1:06:06] battle has ever fought
[1:06:08] it's in the mind go ahead and show the
[1:06:10] picture of the overhead there
[1:06:15] so the greatest battle that you and I
[1:06:17] have is in the mind
[1:06:22] amnesia
[1:06:26] it refers to the loss of memories
[1:06:29] including facts
[1:06:31] information
[1:06:33] and experiences
[1:06:36] it is a general term describing memory
[1:06:39] loss
[1:06:41] symptoms include memory loss confusion
[1:06:46] the inability to recognize familiar
[1:06:49] faces or places
[1:06:52] some of the causes of temporary Amnesia
[1:06:57] include concussion
[1:07:00] severe illness
[1:07:02] high fever
[1:07:03] emotional stress
[1:07:06] and some drugs
[1:07:09] there's three kinds of Amnesia and I
[1:07:12] wish to share with you I'm not a doctor
[1:07:14] and don't go into this but this fits
[1:07:16] perfectly with what the prophet said
[1:07:19] amen he said
[1:07:21] that the we are having a time of
[1:07:24] spiritual amnesia
[1:07:29] three times the first one
[1:07:31] retrograde amnesia
[1:07:34] a person can remember new information
[1:07:36] but cannot remember events before the
[1:07:39] onset of amnesia
[1:07:43] why is it you can remember this and this
[1:07:46] world in this birth but can't remember
[1:07:48] the birth that you had before the
[1:07:50] foundation of the world
[1:07:52] it's because you've got
[1:07:54] retrograde amnesia
[1:07:57] you remember this but don't remember
[1:08:00] that
[1:08:02] the next is
[1:08:04] dissociative amnesia
[1:08:08] a person may forget special events or
[1:08:11] time periods
[1:08:13] they're
[1:08:15] they can't associate with
[1:08:18] they forget specific events
[1:08:22] they cannot recognize their day in its
[1:08:25] message
[1:08:28] they can recognize what God has done in
[1:08:32] the past
[1:08:34] see what he's going to do in the future
[1:08:36] but are failing to see what he's doing
[1:08:38] on present tense
[1:08:41] dissociative
[1:08:43] Amnesia and then traumatic amnesia
[1:08:48] after a head injury
[1:08:51] or some kind of
[1:08:53] traumatic event
[1:08:58] they say that men in battle
[1:09:01] when they see such atrocities and and
[1:09:05] men being killed and blown up in the
[1:09:09] noises and all of that and most of those
[1:09:12] men that go to war were young men
[1:09:18] but they get traumatic Amnesia and they
[1:09:21] lose their identity
[1:09:26] and I want to take you back to another
[1:09:29] event the most cataclysmic
[1:09:32] most shocking
[1:09:34] event
[1:09:35] in world history
[1:09:38] when there was a fall in Eden
[1:09:42] it happened amidst
[1:09:44] a perfect setting
[1:09:49] in a place called Eden
[1:09:51] the a place that God had prepared but
[1:09:54] yet during that time in that place
[1:09:58] there was a great fall and that fall was
[1:10:02] so cataclysmic it was so shocking
[1:10:07] it was so dynamic
[1:10:10] that everyone
[1:10:12] film
[1:10:15] because of that fall
[1:10:18] the Bible says for all of sin
[1:10:21] and come short of the glory of God
[1:10:23] that's why we must be born again
[1:10:27] brother Branham said this battle did not
[1:10:29] start here on Earth it started in heaven
[1:10:32] amen Lucifer said I'm going to ascend my
[1:10:35] throne above the Throne of God it
[1:10:37] started in heaven the prophet of God
[1:10:40] said in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:10:41] it was cast down out of Heaven down to
[1:10:45] earth and it's become a human battle
[1:10:47] ever since
[1:10:53] and Prophet preached the sermon called
[1:10:56] spiritual amnesia
[1:10:58] you only preached it one time but he
[1:11:00] refers to Amnesia multitude times
[1:11:04] throughout his message
[1:11:06] amnesia's a temporary loss of identity
[1:11:14] and the only one of the only ways to
[1:11:17] regain your personal identity
[1:11:20] is to visit
[1:11:22] familiar places
[1:11:25] it jogs your memory
[1:11:29] all of a sudden
[1:11:31] something is said
[1:11:36] something comes to your mind
[1:11:39] and all of a sudden there's a flash
[1:11:44] and you are in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:11:48] you are jettisoned for a millisecond
[1:11:52] into the very mind of God
[1:12:00] and you catch something
[1:12:02] and all of a sudden you're energized oh
[1:12:05] God I wish I could just stay in that
[1:12:09] presence
[1:12:13] Amnesia is the loss of identity
[1:12:18] so the way for God to bring it back to
[1:12:21] you is to
[1:12:22] have you
[1:12:24] come to familiar places
[1:12:31] and I want to say and
[1:12:34] don't think I'm crazy
[1:12:38] but there has been multitudes of times
[1:12:41] in my life that I'm in a situation I'm
[1:12:44] in a place I'm in a setting
[1:12:47] and I say I was here before
[1:12:50] it's not deja vu
[1:12:53] how many of you can say I've had
[1:12:55] Supernatural experiences
[1:12:58] I was here
[1:13:00] before
[1:13:05] the reason that you believe all of the
[1:13:08] Bible stories is because you were there
[1:13:12] not physically but in
[1:13:15] germ form in seed form and I'm going to
[1:13:18] substantiate that for you
[1:13:21] you were a word attribute of God
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:26] so when you hear these Bible stories
[1:13:29] they become not just stories
[1:13:32] but familiar places
[1:13:35] I believe that why
[1:13:38] you were there
[1:13:43] brother Branham said in future home
[1:13:46] of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:13:48] Earthly bride
[1:13:51] that's the same thing he does when he
[1:13:53] gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with
[1:13:55] fire
[1:13:56] he can come and dwell with you
[1:13:59] and we can sit in Heavenly places in
[1:14:02] Christ Jesus
[1:14:04] because we are already in him
[1:14:08] not we will be we are now sitting in
[1:14:13] Christ Jesus
[1:14:15] how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost
[1:14:18] baptism
[1:14:20] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[1:14:22] Christ which we are now won't be in
[1:14:26] Christ we are
[1:14:29] he is a great spiritual King over the
[1:14:33] spirit that's in US
[1:14:35] because we were in him
[1:14:38] at the beginning
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:14:43] so what God was trying to do with job
[1:14:48] he gotten so discouraged
[1:14:51] the trials of Life had gotten so heavy
[1:14:55] that he was even
[1:14:57] burdened so much that it was almost
[1:15:01] suicidal
[1:15:06] so God had to jog his memory
[1:15:10] and take him back to familiar places
[1:15:14] job I want to talk to you
[1:15:17] where were you when I laid the
[1:15:18] foundation
[1:15:21] where were you
[1:15:24] when I laid the Seas and I did this and
[1:15:28] I did that where were you job
[1:15:31] and all of a sudden
[1:15:34] I demand of you an answer
[1:15:40] because job
[1:15:42] was there
[1:15:45] and all of a sudden
[1:15:47] he was jettisoned back
[1:15:49] I was there
[1:15:51] I go back to in the beginning I go back
[1:15:54] before the beginning I go back into the
[1:15:57] very mind of God
[1:15:59] and I go back to beyond my conception of
[1:16:03] my natural birth with
[1:16:05] my mother who conceived me
[1:16:09] I go back from that birth
[1:16:12] into another birth
[1:16:14] the prophet of God calls it a word birth
[1:16:18] Hallelujah
[1:16:20] I want you to understand that when a
[1:16:22] word gives a birth it can only bring
[1:16:25] forth another word yes when the word of
[1:16:29] God hallelujah
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:33] creates in its power
[1:16:36] and it brings forth another one
[1:16:39] it will be a God one it can be nothing
[1:16:44] else nothing short of it
[1:16:49] God
[1:16:51] cloning himself
[1:16:57] amen
[1:17:02] the reason Abraham was seeking for a
[1:17:05] city
[1:17:05] whose Builder and maker was God
[1:17:10] because he'd been there
[1:17:13] before
[1:17:16] so when
[1:17:18] he told him to go seek this place
[1:17:22] you see God in his mind in Abraham's
[1:17:25] mind
[1:17:27] he could see it
[1:17:29] and so he sojourned
[1:17:32] among people looking for it
[1:17:36] because it was familiar to him
[1:17:41] don't think I'm crazy this morning
[1:17:48] and may I say this
[1:17:51] what I am seeing within the message
[1:17:54] right now me personally
[1:17:57] is so exciting
[1:18:01] I can't hardly contain it
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:05] the message is becoming clearer
[1:18:08] and clearer
[1:18:10] when I listen to a tape
[1:18:13] I hear a voice within the voice
[1:18:17] I see something greater than I've ever
[1:18:19] seen before
[1:18:21] I want to say It's Supernatural
[1:18:26] I every time I read a message book it
[1:18:30] jettisons me back to places it's a deep
[1:18:33] calling to the Deep because there's a
[1:18:36] deep inside of me to respond back what
[1:18:39] is it familiar places
[1:18:46] brother Brenham said in the God of this
[1:18:49] evil age in the beginning before there
[1:18:51] was a beginning he was gone
[1:18:53] and did you know you were in him then
[1:18:58] if you are a Christian now you was in
[1:19:00] him then
[1:19:03] and then if that be so the whole godhead
[1:19:07] bodily shaved up in the person of Jesus
[1:19:09] Christ
[1:19:11] and when Jesus died at the cross
[1:19:18] I died with him
[1:19:21] for I was in him then
[1:19:25] oh God help me
[1:19:28] he was the fullness of the word
[1:19:30] manifested
[1:19:32] knowing that we would be manifested
[1:19:34] later
[1:19:36] and we was at Calvary with him
[1:19:39] we went in the grave with him
[1:19:43] and we raised with him at his
[1:19:45] resurrection
[1:19:47] and now we're ascended by his spirit
[1:19:51] I tell you there's a church rising up
[1:19:54] I say I'm rising
[1:19:58] I'm continually Rising
[1:20:02] and now we're ascending by a spirit to
[1:20:05] the throne of grace
[1:20:07] sitting together in Heavenly places in
[1:20:10] Christ Jesus
[1:20:13] the Bible is filled
[1:20:17] with familiar places and familiar events
[1:20:23] the reason you believe the story about
[1:20:25] Noah
[1:20:28] you was there
[1:20:33] don't think I'm crazy
[1:20:44] Christ The Mystery of God revealed in
[1:20:46] his own word
[1:20:48] if you are a son of God and if I am a
[1:20:50] Son of God or a daughter of God
[1:20:53] we were in God at the beginning
[1:20:55] and when Jesus became the fullness of
[1:20:58] the word
[1:21:00] then we were in him
[1:21:01] germ form
[1:21:04] when he was crucified we was crucified
[1:21:06] in his body
[1:21:09] when he arose from the dead we rose with
[1:21:13] him
[1:21:16] and now since we have recognized it now
[1:21:19] we sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:21:22] him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:21:25] now if we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:21:28] we are God's children
[1:21:30] then we are his attributes of God
[1:21:34] then we got eternal life
[1:21:36] and God is the only eternal life there
[1:21:39] is then we were in him from the
[1:21:41] beginning
[1:21:43] and when Jesus became all that word then
[1:21:46] we were a part of him then
[1:21:49] amen there you are
[1:21:52] when that's in there there is no devil
[1:21:57] no powers no nothing can ever move it
[1:22:00] that is the type post
[1:22:03] of the Soul
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:11] the Bible says let this mind it was in
[1:22:13] Christ be also be in you
[1:22:16] they thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:22:18] with God
[1:22:24] Revelation is making you realize
[1:22:27] something
[1:22:28] that you knew before
[1:22:33] I knew that
[1:22:36] the first time I heard serpent seed
[1:22:40] I started laughing I said I knew that
[1:22:43] what no apple that's right
[1:22:50] that's right can you understand what I'm
[1:22:51] saying
[1:22:52] when the prophet begins to reveal Christ
[1:22:55] the word and because you're an attribute
[1:22:57] of the word when you hear it it's a
[1:22:59] familiar place when you say he's not
[1:23:01] three Gods he's one all of a sudden you
[1:23:04] say I know that
[1:23:06] I knew it before
[1:23:10] familiar places
[1:23:13] foreign
[1:23:15] I've been there
[1:23:20] Revelation is the removal of amnesia
[1:23:25] Revelation is having the eyes of your
[1:23:27] understanding being open we walk by
[1:23:30] faith and not by sight
[1:23:33] I want to say this morning that I am
[1:23:35] walking in familiar places in Christ
[1:23:39] Jesus
[1:23:42] the prophet's message
[1:23:45] resonates
[1:23:48] within my soul
[1:23:51] and I say
[1:23:53] I've been there before
[1:24:00] when he speaks about the Days of Elijah
[1:24:04] and a Mount Carmel Showdown
[1:24:08] and when he so elaborates
[1:24:11] and becomes so descriptive
[1:24:14] I don't know about you but I enter into
[1:24:17] the vision with him
[1:24:21] he says there comes that old
[1:24:24] bald-headed Elijah the sun glistening
[1:24:27] off the top of his head
[1:24:29] and he looks down into the valley in his
[1:24:32] eyes narrow
[1:24:34] and he says and there his feet Dusty
[1:24:37] from the trail that he's on and he looks
[1:24:40] down into the valley and he sees the sin
[1:24:44] I tell you my brother my sister there
[1:24:46] are times when this Prophet becomes so
[1:24:49] descriptive you know why he can be so
[1:24:52] descriptive
[1:24:54] because he was there
[1:25:02] he goes back into the very mind of God
[1:25:06] transports back into time
[1:25:09] and all of a sudden here he is Mount
[1:25:12] Carmel yeah here he is with all of the
[1:25:15] false prophets
[1:25:17] and he says and I
[1:25:19] and I stand alone as God's prophet
[1:25:23] and the god that answers by fire let him
[1:25:26] be God
[1:25:32] this is part of the identified Christ of
[1:25:36] all ages
[1:25:38] that's why the prophet of God said
[1:25:41] watch he said it was Christ in David
[1:25:47] my bones they stare at me
[1:25:51] he said it was Christ in Ezekiel I see a
[1:25:55] wheel within a wheel
[1:25:58] he sees the Prophet Jeremiah crying and
[1:26:01] weeping over Jerusalem
[1:26:05] it was Christ it was not Jesus
[1:26:11] it was the Christ of God
[1:26:14] that anointing
[1:26:17] and that anointing
[1:26:19] has led
[1:26:21] and evolved the evolution of God himself
[1:26:26] Through Time
[1:26:30] and let me say this you
[1:26:33] if you're a seed Gene of God
[1:26:36] you're part of that evolution
[1:26:43] history keeps repeating itself
[1:26:48] we've been there before
[1:26:52] I remember the first time that I saw the
[1:26:55] book A man sent from God
[1:26:58] and I opened the front pages
[1:27:02] and I saw the one of being in a tent
[1:27:07] and the photographer was at the back of
[1:27:10] the tent and the people were turned
[1:27:11] around looking at the photographer
[1:27:18] I had never read the book I had never
[1:27:21] seen the picture before
[1:27:32] I'm 18 years old
[1:27:36] I don't know nothing about this magic
[1:27:39] I looked at that picture and I said
[1:27:46] the faces of the people
[1:27:50] said I wasn't there
[1:27:52] how do I know I was there
[1:27:55] because there's something
[1:27:57] that responds
[1:27:59] no man speak like this man
[1:28:02] it's a familiar place and all of a
[1:28:05] sudden bang I was there when he was
[1:28:07] preaching Serpent's Seed when he was
[1:28:10] opening the seals I was there
[1:28:14] can you say Amen to that
[1:28:22] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:28:24] couple long quotes here if I could
[1:28:31] I'm going to read just the highlighted
[1:28:33] portion
[1:28:35] and any son is the attributes of his
[1:28:37] father and just as you were in the genes
[1:28:40] of your father in the body of your
[1:28:42] father
[1:28:43] when he was a young boy
[1:28:45] you were in him
[1:28:48] yet he could not have fellowship with
[1:28:50] you because he didn't know you
[1:28:52] but then through the bedding grounds of
[1:28:55] a mother you were brought forth into the
[1:28:57] Earth and become in the image of your
[1:29:00] father then he could have fellowship
[1:29:02] with you
[1:29:05] so were you Sons and Daughters of God
[1:29:09] before there even was a moon stars or a
[1:29:14] molecule now watch he he goes from a
[1:29:16] natural to spiritual
[1:29:20] you were Sons and Daughters of God for
[1:29:23] you are only the physical manifestation
[1:29:26] of the attributes that was in God at the
[1:29:30] beginning
[1:29:31] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:29:34] and that was you
[1:29:37] before
[1:29:39] you don't know nothing about it why you
[1:29:43] forgot it
[1:29:48] let me just for a moment
[1:29:52] say that
[1:29:54] because I'm not giving you the quote but
[1:29:57] you all know it he says it many times
[1:29:59] he said when Satan rose up
[1:30:03] and he preached his sermon in heaven he
[1:30:05] said you were there
[1:30:11] and Satan preached his
[1:30:14] his sermon and he caused
[1:30:17] excuse my mind but it may be a third or
[1:30:20] two-thirds of Heaven the stars filled
[1:30:22] with him
[1:30:24] and he said and there was a small group
[1:30:26] that was left behind
[1:30:30] and they said we will not bow amen
[1:30:36] they didn't believe the story
[1:30:48] and God said
[1:30:51] I am well pleased
[1:30:54] because they cannot deny themselves
[1:30:59] because when they deny themselves they
[1:31:01] deny me
[1:31:05] and so God and brother Brown said wiped
[1:31:08] away your memory
[1:31:12] you remember nothing about it
[1:31:17] and down through time here he watches
[1:31:19] over the seed in your great great great
[1:31:21] and on down and on down and so forth and
[1:31:25] all the way down and your mom and dad
[1:31:27] finally got together and bang you come
[1:31:30] and guess what you're no mistake
[1:31:33] God watched over that seed and your
[1:31:36] great great great great great great
[1:31:36] great and he should have died and this
[1:31:39] and that and everything but God watched
[1:31:40] over spared his life and this and that
[1:31:42] and guess what Bane you're here
[1:31:45] okay
[1:31:48] and he says he took a little bit of ting
[1:31:51] you remember that he said he's like
[1:31:53] making a bell he took a little Ting out
[1:31:55] of your great great grandpa
[1:31:57] and he took one a little bit out of this
[1:31:59] one and a little bit of that one and he
[1:32:01] makes it all together you wonder why you
[1:32:03] are so unique
[1:32:04] because you're a mixture
[1:32:07] of lineage
[1:32:09] amen
[1:32:10] of your great great great great great
[1:32:17] Royal lineage
[1:32:19] Royal lineage
[1:32:27] all right
[1:32:30] in verse
[1:32:31] or in paragraph 61 therefore assures
[1:32:34] your Gene had to be in your father
[1:32:36] before your natural birth your spiritual
[1:32:38] Gene had to be in God
[1:32:41] because you're an expression of the
[1:32:43] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:32:44] foundation of the world right no way
[1:32:46] around it that's right
[1:32:48] now now we notice then that life being
[1:32:51] in you God's life being in you from the
[1:32:54] foundation of the world
[1:32:57] how many of you believe it
[1:33:03] things that are to be
[1:33:06] brother Branham says
[1:33:08] therefore
[1:33:10] you walked with him
[1:33:13] you were in him
[1:33:16] when he was on the Earth
[1:33:19] you suffered with him
[1:33:24] you died with him
[1:33:27] you were buried with him
[1:33:30] and now you're risen with him
[1:33:34] and manifested attributes of God setting
[1:33:37] in Heavenly places
[1:33:39] already raised
[1:33:42] resurrected to New Life
[1:33:45] and setting in Heavenly places in
[1:33:48] Christ's old Christ Jesus oh that means
[1:33:51] so much nowadays church that means so
[1:33:54] much to us to see ourselves positionally
[1:33:57] placed in Jesus Christ
[1:34:05] now I don't have the quote but just from
[1:34:07] memory
[1:34:09] brother Brenham says I want to
[1:34:12] tell you the Rapture is in you now
[1:34:15] he said don't resent this
[1:34:19] he said the Rapture is in you now
[1:34:24] how many of you believe that
[1:34:26] let me see this there's nothing you can
[1:34:28] do to try to work it up to make it
[1:34:30] happen there's nothing you can't pray
[1:34:32] enough you can't live righteous enough
[1:34:34] you can't do anything it has nothing
[1:34:38] to do with you
[1:34:40] it's got everything to do with the seed
[1:34:43] and God's covenant and he's watching
[1:34:46] over you and he that begun the good work
[1:34:48] in you he will finish it somebody give
[1:34:52] God praise this morning
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:35:01] let me see
[1:35:02] this and may I say it as humbly as I can
[1:35:09] I realize that what I am seeing others
[1:35:12] may not
[1:35:14] I know some of you are not getting it
[1:35:19] but I can't help you to see what I see
[1:35:23] now brother Brenham let me just throw
[1:35:25] this because I'm not throwing you a
[1:35:26] curveball
[1:35:30] I'm not wanting to strike you out
[1:35:34] I want to jog your memory
[1:35:39] brother brennaman questions and answers
[1:35:42] between the six and seven seal
[1:35:45] he says now when this seventh seal comes
[1:35:47] before you I know you're not getting it
[1:35:51] you're not supposed to get it
[1:35:54] he said well you say brother Brown he
[1:35:56] said no no no just wait yeah
[1:36:00] huh don't put no interpretation to it
[1:36:03] yeah but brother no no when you go
[1:36:05] listen to that I played that quote to
[1:36:07] you before where you hear his voice so
[1:36:10] what I'm saying
[1:36:12] is I know some of you are not getting it
[1:36:15] that's okay you will
[1:36:17] in time
[1:36:19] some of you are slow
[1:36:22] of heart
[1:36:24] to believe all that to Prophet has said
[1:36:27] that's okay
[1:36:29] some
[1:36:31] students in the same class under the
[1:36:33] same teacher
[1:36:35] some get accelerated very quickly and
[1:36:38] others
[1:36:39] are a little slow
[1:36:42] they just need a little further
[1:36:44] explanation
[1:36:46] they need the teacher to go over it one
[1:36:48] more time they need one more sermon
[1:36:51] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:36:53] amen
[1:36:56] but I can't help seeing what I see
[1:37:01] I believe
[1:37:03] that God
[1:37:05] is taking me into the things where
[1:37:08] he said greater things shall you see
[1:37:12] I want to say it I'm seeing it
[1:37:18] I know others are seeing it
[1:37:21] in fact when you get around them
[1:37:27] we go to
[1:37:29] getting excited together yes
[1:37:32] you don't believe it just sit down with
[1:37:34] brother Paul Lovell sometime
[1:37:38] you go to breakfast with him on Monday
[1:37:40] morning
[1:37:41] because he's been feeding on the word
[1:37:42] the whole time you know what you said
[1:37:44] Sunday and so yeah
[1:37:48] amen yes brother on I tell you and he
[1:37:52] sits there and sometimes he beats yeah
[1:37:54] he does
[1:37:58] it's just he can't contain his
[1:38:01] excitement
[1:38:03] I hold on to my cup of coffee when I'm
[1:38:06] around here
[1:38:09] and I love a man who gets excited about
[1:38:11] what he believes I love to see a man who
[1:38:14] gets so excited because he's he's being
[1:38:17] revelated and stimulated not by music
[1:38:22] no
[1:38:23] but by the word being revealed to you
[1:38:26] Hallelujah and it starts a song inside
[1:38:30] of you it starts to dance inside of you
[1:38:33] it starts a movement inside of you it
[1:38:36] has nothing to do
[1:38:38] with everyone else
[1:38:40] it's between you and God hallelujah I've
[1:38:43] been in familiar places
[1:38:52] it gets so plain for me
[1:38:56] they have a trouble trying to show you
[1:39:00] I'm not a good teacher
[1:39:05] but I do want to do this I want to
[1:39:07] declare unto you the whole counsel of
[1:39:09] God
[1:39:14] someone had come to me
[1:39:16] recently and I certainly appreciate it
[1:39:22] he tells me he said brother Ron you've
[1:39:24] been over teaching
[1:39:27] on certain subjects you need to get job
[1:39:30] off the ashy
[1:39:34] I own that brother
[1:39:37] I do I take it very seriously
[1:39:40] I realized that when I study
[1:39:43] you know what my problem is Jonathan
[1:39:46] I study exhaustive
[1:39:50] I don't just look up a quote
[1:39:53] and I just look up a quote that fits
[1:39:56] what maybe what I see because if the
[1:39:59] prophet of God
[1:40:00] begins to talk about the third poll look
[1:40:03] at all of the quotes on third floor
[1:40:07] are you understanding with me don't just
[1:40:10] take that one that kind of fits in
[1:40:12] Hallelujah I believe that we are wearing
[1:40:15] out some of the quotes that preachers
[1:40:17] are seeing and they're wearing it out
[1:40:19] and over and over and don't you believe
[1:40:21] this and don't you believe that well
[1:40:23] there's more keep reading keep reading
[1:40:26] there's more
[1:40:29] once in a while to come across a quote
[1:40:32] that you don't understand it shakes you
[1:40:35] wow why did he say that
[1:40:37] he causes you to start thinking
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:43] I want you to be a parent
[1:40:46] just a repeater
[1:40:49] Polly want a cracker
[1:40:53] no not not to just see
[1:40:57] but have it here
[1:40:59] amen
[1:41:01] not just a repeater
[1:41:07] when I what I teach and I preach at this
[1:41:10] church
[1:41:11] is because I feel led to teach and to
[1:41:14] preach it
[1:41:16] not because of what others are doing
[1:41:19] understand
[1:41:21] although
[1:41:23] at times it may look
[1:41:26] but you know let me just be honest with
[1:41:29] you too
[1:41:30] I'm not out here streaming everybody
[1:41:32] else's services
[1:41:37] huh I don't
[1:41:39] I don't go out here and once in a while
[1:41:41] somebody will send me a uh a video of a
[1:41:45] brother of what he preached oh yeah I'll
[1:41:47] go listen to it yeah I hate my nice
[1:41:49] wonderful but honestly
[1:41:52] I am so
[1:41:55] embedded
[1:41:58] into this message
[1:42:01] I'm not really interested on
[1:42:04] what this one says and his
[1:42:06] interpretation and his opinion
[1:42:09] because I want to see I want to have it
[1:42:11] straight from the horse's mouth or may I
[1:42:14] say the prophets mouth
[1:42:16] say what I say on those tapes is that
[1:42:20] okay with you
[1:42:21] so excuse me
[1:42:26] um
[1:42:27] I am an oddball
[1:42:30] I have been since I came into this
[1:42:32] message
[1:42:34] it is one of the first tapes that I
[1:42:37] listened to and it's the first book that
[1:42:40] I physically owned a spoken word book
[1:42:43] the oddball
[1:42:45] and I read it and I read it and I reread
[1:42:48] it and I read it again
[1:42:51] sure
[1:42:52] and he remember that
[1:42:54] that man he says hey he says see that
[1:42:56] car going down the road
[1:42:59] he said if you take away all of the nuts
[1:43:04] it's nothing but a bunch of junk
[1:43:09] I am a nut
[1:43:12] but I'm threaded
[1:43:15] to the great bolt that every time he
[1:43:17] makes a turn
[1:43:20] huh and crank it down yeah come on man
[1:43:23] because every turn you make every sermon
[1:43:25] I hear I'm cranked up that much higher
[1:43:28] Hallelujah I want you to understand what
[1:43:30] God is doing in this message is he is
[1:43:33] bringing a bride to maturity he is
[1:43:36] bringing her to higher Heights like John
[1:43:38] John come up you there come up out of
[1:43:41] this nonsense come up out of this all of
[1:43:43] this nonsense and denominational ideas I
[1:43:46] have called you to come up into Heavenly
[1:43:49] places I want to bring you to a familiar
[1:43:51] place I want to bring you I want to
[1:43:53] stimulate you I don't want it to be just
[1:43:56] my music I don't want it to be by some
[1:43:58] man I want to do it in the secret of his
[1:44:02] Tabernacle
[1:44:05] get alone
[1:44:09] I'll meet you
[1:44:11] in there
[1:44:14] I want to say I've met him yes
[1:44:20] now
[1:44:25] so if you don't mind I am the Oddball
[1:44:28] and the older I get
[1:44:32] the more odd I become
[1:44:36] I do I
[1:44:40] the brother that brought me to the
[1:44:42] message one of them
[1:44:45] he backslid and went away from it
[1:44:49] he said brother wrong we don't we no
[1:44:51] longer
[1:44:52] believe the message
[1:44:55] he called me up
[1:44:57] they moved back to California
[1:45:01] all of their children
[1:45:04] you know their daughter played a piano
[1:45:06] for their pastor
[1:45:08] they all were holding us dressed
[1:45:16] and he said brother Ron
[1:45:19] we'd like you to come visit us in
[1:45:21] California
[1:45:26] and I said well I don't go to caliber
[1:45:29] for you very often I said ever since
[1:45:31] that God called me out of there I really
[1:45:34] I take it very serious about going back
[1:45:38] and so he said well if you ever come
[1:45:40] they live in San Bernardino
[1:45:44] just as you drop off the mountains you
[1:45:46] you cross the San Andreas Fault
[1:45:49] come down into San Bernardino the valley
[1:45:51] there
[1:45:52] he said why don't you come visit us I
[1:45:54] said his name's Richard
[1:45:57] I said Richard I'd love that
[1:46:00] he said but there's one thing I request
[1:46:03] he said don't bring your Branham
[1:46:04] Doctrine with you
[1:46:11] the man
[1:46:13] that told me about brother Branham
[1:46:16] the man that we
[1:46:19] fellowship with we listened to tapes
[1:46:21] together we rejoiced over the things we
[1:46:25] heard
[1:46:27] and he said don't bring it
[1:46:29] with you when you come I said
[1:46:32] Richard I'm sorry to tell you
[1:46:34] I can't be separated
[1:46:39] I am the message
[1:46:42] the message and I have become one
[1:46:44] there's been an invisible Union
[1:46:48] you can't you can't separate me from the
[1:46:50] Bible
[1:46:52] why the word is inside of me the message
[1:46:55] which is Christ is inside of me
[1:46:59] hallelujah how many of you can say
[1:47:01] that's with me also I am the message I
[1:47:05] am taking this now let me share with you
[1:47:08] what I feel is the reason why there's
[1:47:12] confusion coming among the message right
[1:47:15] now
[1:47:17] it is dependent upon which book you're
[1:47:20] eating
[1:47:22] because remember Christ took the scroll
[1:47:26] of Isaiah found where it was written of
[1:47:28] him
[1:47:29] and he opened the book
[1:47:32] and he read the scriptures he identified
[1:47:35] his ministry in Scripture
[1:47:38] amen
[1:47:40] and then he closed the book
[1:47:44] you can have an open book
[1:47:47] and the same one that opened it closes
[1:47:49] it
[1:47:51] so this message I want to say is an open
[1:47:54] book to those who have the Holy Ghost
[1:47:58] who to them the revealing of Christ
[1:48:00] continues there's a continual unveiling
[1:48:04] and the message going on and on and on
[1:48:07] can you say Amen why because you're
[1:48:10] eating from the open book but there's a
[1:48:14] some
[1:48:16] who've got the same book but it's closed
[1:48:19] read the same message
[1:48:21] listen to the same tape
[1:48:25] was seven seal ain't even open
[1:48:29] there ain't no way he could have this
[1:48:31] Prophet could have fulfilled Revelation
[1:48:33] 10 7 and then they go off because you
[1:48:36] know what what happens
[1:48:39] if you don't have revelation of the Holy
[1:48:41] Spirit you have carnal interpretation of
[1:48:46] man
[1:48:47] and you learn
[1:48:50] and you can be ever learning but never
[1:48:52] come to the knowledge of Truth amen
[1:48:57] I'm afraid we've learned this message
[1:49:01] yup
[1:49:02] we've boiled it down let's condense this
[1:49:05] message
[1:49:06] it's a long dress
[1:49:08] it's uncut here
[1:49:13] huh it's no makeup
[1:49:15] no jewelry
[1:49:18] no shorts on demand
[1:49:22] uncut hair
[1:49:24] we don't we have hey we got it down
[1:49:29] we're trying to conform
[1:49:34] we do a good job of it
[1:49:37] we preach it so hard we tighten it down
[1:49:39] and I'll tell you what we have people
[1:49:41] that have been raised up and around this
[1:49:43] message for years maybe 30 40 years some
[1:49:47] of them even preachers
[1:49:52] turn right around because it's not
[1:49:54] revealed to them because what happened
[1:49:57] they went by by head knowledge
[1:50:00] they went by man's interpretation and
[1:50:02] I'll tell you what when you follow a man
[1:50:04] if that man falls you fall with him
[1:50:07] but if you're following not the man but
[1:50:10] the Christ in the man that even if the
[1:50:13] man falls you don't fall why because
[1:50:15] Christ never did fall
[1:50:17] amen Hallelujah we all got problems we
[1:50:21] all got issues
[1:50:24] that's true
[1:50:26] but I serve a God who doesn't have
[1:50:28] issues
[1:50:29] I serve a God who brings me
[1:50:32] to higher Heights and deeper depths in
[1:50:34] Christ
[1:50:36] amen so you are either
[1:50:38] eating from the open book or the closed
[1:50:41] book right
[1:50:44] that's why Doctrine well prophets got to
[1:50:48] rise again come on the scene because you
[1:50:49] know what we ain't even got Rapture and
[1:50:51] faith and and he's got to fly the mostly
[1:50:53] airplane got to shoot a brown bear he's
[1:50:55] got to do this and this pretty soon we
[1:50:57] got an itinerary don't we yeah
[1:50:59] well listen God is his own interpreter
[1:51:01] yeah
[1:51:03] yeah right God don't need you to
[1:51:07] speculate just say what he said
[1:51:10] amen God God
[1:51:13] fulfills his word by bringing it to pass
[1:51:16] amen how many of you believe that
[1:51:20] so you're even eating from the open book
[1:51:23] or a closed book
[1:51:25] or
[1:51:27] you're constantly eating from everybody
[1:51:30] else's table through the internet
[1:51:33] I don't mind go ahead
[1:51:36] I will not forbid you to go and listen
[1:51:38] to other ministers
[1:51:41] but I will tell you not all that say
[1:51:44] they are of Israel are of Israel
[1:51:49] because they hang up the shingle of
[1:51:51] Malachi 4 and Revelations 10 7 don't
[1:51:54] mean they're in the message you wait
[1:51:56] until you see the fruits of the message
[1:51:58] in them
[1:52:00] all kinds of denominational spirits and
[1:52:03] one rising up and this one rising up
[1:52:05] pretty soon we've divided the whole body
[1:52:09] sick of it
[1:52:14] it's amazing how many different
[1:52:15] doctrines we can have within the what we
[1:52:18] all got the same Bible we all got the
[1:52:20] same message
[1:52:22] boy I'll tell you what just look at uh
[1:52:24] some major subject how about marriage
[1:52:26] and divorce
[1:52:29] because that will be the biggest issue
[1:52:31] until the very end why it goes back to
[1:52:33] the original sin
[1:52:37] qualifications of a minister
[1:52:42] Church order
[1:52:44] music
[1:52:46] taking up an offering foot washing
[1:52:48] communion brother random says now look
[1:52:51] all of you now I'm giving you an example
[1:52:53] and he said here but he says every
[1:52:55] church is Sovereign is that true
[1:52:58] The Sovereign if you want to pass the
[1:52:59] plate Pass the Plate because I do have a
[1:53:02] quote brother Brown said if you fail to
[1:53:04] pass a plate you deny somebody an
[1:53:07] ability to give in an offering
[1:53:11] and he said and yet you can put a box in
[1:53:13] the back or you can do it you know he
[1:53:15] never said online
[1:53:18] we didn't have the online back then duh
[1:53:24] do you understand what I'm saying but he
[1:53:26] did say pay ties
[1:53:28] and he said Pay ties to where you're
[1:53:30] getting fed
[1:53:31] and he also said he said have a home
[1:53:34] Church
[1:53:35] and he says and have a place that you
[1:53:37] call your post to duty
[1:53:39] any of you in the military any of you
[1:53:41] served military time let me see hands
[1:53:44] there's brother Steve yeah huh
[1:53:46] Dave pollock a couple others hey
[1:53:50] if you were in the military
[1:53:53] and you got orders to go somewhere
[1:53:56] and let's say you go from
[1:53:59] Fort Huachuca to be sent to Vietnam
[1:54:02] and you're there with a company and
[1:54:04] you're with this regiment and whatever
[1:54:06] and that becomes your post of Duty
[1:54:13] brother Brenham says all of you
[1:54:15] he says have somewhere that you are
[1:54:19] called to a post of Duty and when God
[1:54:21] has called you there you be faithful and
[1:54:24] you don't leave until you get orders to
[1:54:26] go elsewhere otherwise if you leave your
[1:54:29] posted Duty
[1:54:31] what do they call it
[1:54:33] well he went AWOL what does that mean
[1:54:38] absent without leave
[1:54:43] what happens to a guy who in AWOL
[1:54:47] yeah you in trouble buddy
[1:54:53] don't go AWOL
[1:54:55] no State you're posted dude
[1:54:58] amen amen now I'm I'm just
[1:55:01] um
[1:55:02] you're bringing some things to you
[1:55:05] brother Ram said how about the gifts in
[1:55:07] the assembly
[1:55:09] whether it be tongues prophecies
[1:55:12] foot washing communion
[1:55:16] all of those things
[1:55:19] I want you to understand that we have a
[1:55:22] guideline that he has already said and
[1:55:24] he says whenever you have a question go
[1:55:26] back and listen to this tape is that
[1:55:28] right
[1:55:29] then why in the world do we have so many
[1:55:31] divisions
[1:55:33] because when you have ministers
[1:55:36] who disagree with another Minister what
[1:55:39] happens is you draw a wall
[1:55:42] right now
[1:55:44] I did an exhaustive study
[1:55:47] on disagreeing with a brother
[1:55:52] okay
[1:55:53] exhausted
[1:55:54] you find as many quotes where Brethren
[1:55:57] said well people-wide they disagree with
[1:56:00] me
[1:56:01] and he said as far as East from West why
[1:56:03] my wife and I disagree
[1:56:06] even over pie right
[1:56:09] or different and he says listen I don't
[1:56:12] care you can disagree with me as far as
[1:56:15] East from West you're welcome to come to
[1:56:17] this church just don't so Discord
[1:56:20] and he said don't have a disagreeable
[1:56:22] spirit
[1:56:24] huh well I'll tell you what
[1:56:27] you don't see it the way I see it you're
[1:56:29] out of here
[1:56:31] huh mean as a junkyard dog
[1:56:38] I don't ask all of you to believe
[1:56:40] exactly everything see it exactly I see
[1:56:43] everything
[1:56:44] no
[1:56:47] but I think we shouldn't be disagreeable
[1:56:50] amen
[1:56:51] you ever disagreed with somebody
[1:56:54] over a doctrinal issue and it severed
[1:56:57] your fellowship
[1:57:01] now how childish is that
[1:57:04] yeah that's childish
[1:57:05] well
[1:57:07] I'll tell you well
[1:57:08] huh who said you're right
[1:57:15] who said you're right
[1:57:19] excuse me my wife tells me never use me
[1:57:22] as an example
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:26] her and I will have a time of
[1:57:31] intense Fellowship over something
[1:57:33] I said
[1:57:35] why is your opinion better than mine
[1:57:40] are you the authority
[1:57:43] now
[1:57:47] I
[1:57:48] I just said okay okay all right
[1:57:51] now I tell you what she's very good at
[1:57:52] colors I'm not
[1:57:55] I'm colorblind
[1:57:58] I
[1:57:59] I've told you before I see
[1:58:01] Reds and yellows and blues and greens
[1:58:05] but together with my eyes open ah you
[1:58:08] guys all hey yeah it's red that's orange
[1:58:10] you got blue pants on yeah yeah light
[1:58:14] nice light blue shirt I see those things
[1:58:16] okay but uh thank God
[1:58:21] that I have both eyes open
[1:58:23] because otherwise I have Kodachrome and
[1:58:26] ectochrome any of you remember any of
[1:58:28] you take pictures years ago 35
[1:58:30] millimeter
[1:58:31] film huh if you're a photographer
[1:58:34] Kodachrome he would go outside you want
[1:58:36] you or or with pictures of of facial
[1:58:40] features
[1:58:41] you want the nice Hue of the skin and
[1:58:44] everything you'd like to take it that's
[1:58:46] Kodachrome but if you go outside and you
[1:58:48] want to take pictures of trees and
[1:58:50] leaves and lakes and oceans and all and
[1:58:52] you want the intensity blues and greens
[1:58:56] okay then you've got ectochrome you took
[1:58:59] the pictures same film just different
[1:59:02] processing internet you understand what
[1:59:04] I'm talking about so anyway we all see
[1:59:07] things a little bit differently amen
[1:59:09] is that right
[1:59:11] if we all saw an accident out here on
[1:59:14] the street and an officer asked us to
[1:59:16] give us a report give him a report of
[1:59:18] the accident we'd all see a little bit
[1:59:20] different
[1:59:21] do you understand
[1:59:23] so does that mean that we got to get
[1:59:25] upset and call somebody else that
[1:59:27] they're wrong because they see it
[1:59:28] differently
[1:59:29] ah stop it that's jolly
[1:59:33] amen that's childish
[1:59:35] so
[1:59:39] the open book is revealed to you by the
[1:59:42] Holy Spirit
[1:59:44] wow
[1:59:48] my
[1:59:50] the clothes book is subject to carnal
[1:59:53] and human understanding and
[1:59:54] self-interpretation
[1:59:57] so it depends on which book you're
[1:59:58] eating from
[2:00:00] because the same book that he opened he
[2:00:03] also closed do you see that
[2:00:06] the opening of the word what we call the
[2:00:08] third pull the opening of the word the
[2:00:11] Mysteries revealed praise God listen my
[2:00:15] Epiphany if I could call it that the
[2:00:19] time when my pastor sent me over to
[2:00:22] Europe to start the spoken word office
[2:00:25] the first spoken word office outside of
[2:00:28] Jeffersonville
[2:00:29] and the wife and I we moved over to to
[2:00:32] Germany and we started in office now
[2:00:35] until that time I never had a complete
[2:00:38] set of tapes
[2:00:40] do you remember when you used to go
[2:00:42] right to voice of God and you'd get the
[2:00:44] little package of tapes and they'd send
[2:00:47] it to you and as soon as you paid for
[2:00:49] that they send you the next
[2:00:52] but how many of you can say I never had
[2:00:54] a complete set of tapes
[2:00:56] do you know how much a set of tapes from
[2:00:58] 47 to 65
[2:01:02] yeah five grand how many of you got five
[2:01:04] grand yo okay man here you go
[2:01:06] man no
[2:01:08] if you were like
[2:01:10] we we live paycheck to paycheck
[2:01:14] but this was the first time wow
[2:01:16] I got all of the cassettes from 47 to
[2:01:19] 65. put them on the shelves put them in
[2:01:22] their chronological order got as many
[2:01:24] books we got the church age book man
[2:01:27] sent from God you name it whatever books
[2:01:29] voice of God had or spoken word had at
[2:01:32] that time they were in our office and we
[2:01:34] were sending and giving them out to
[2:01:37] anyone who was asking for when we moved
[2:01:39] to Europe Sandy help me out how many
[2:01:42] people were on the mailing list of
[2:01:44] spoken word when we moved to Europe
[2:01:47] huh
[2:01:49] 43.
[2:01:51] 43 people in France

[2:01:59] in Switzerland
[2:02:01] 43 whopping
[2:02:05] Mega Church Believers
[2:02:10] why
[2:02:12] because it was in English
[2:02:15] if you spoke French
[2:02:18] and you know parlez-vous English
[2:02:23] right why if I gave you a book in
[2:02:26] English and you polybu Francaise
[2:02:29] yeah yeah huh
[2:02:31] if you know French why would you want an
[2:02:33] English book
[2:02:36] hey that that's a no-brainer right so
[2:02:39] but I told Brother Joseph excuse me but
[2:02:41] I'm gonna I'm gonna give you some real
[2:02:43] personal stuff when Joseph Branham took
[2:02:46] over spoken word
[2:02:47] because all of you you older people here
[2:02:50] remember spoken word is where you went
[2:02:53] and got the books all the printed books
[2:02:55] how many remember that
[2:02:57] Roy borders
[2:03:00] Roy borders spoken word publication and
[2:03:03] in the front of every one of the book
[2:03:05] this book is given you free of charge it
[2:03:08] is the transliteration
[2:03:12] in other words does anybody know what
[2:03:13] transliteration means it means exactly
[2:03:17] as it was spoken no correction if
[2:03:20] brother Brown said now Moses built the
[2:03:23] ark and went through the tribulation
[2:03:25] e we change it and we put Noah no
[2:03:30] transliteration
[2:03:32] it's exactly as the way it was preached
[2:03:35] now you don't have to stumble over
[2:03:37] little mistakes how many of you make
[2:03:41] mistakes like that all the time I I tell
[2:03:44] my family I I've sat at the table I've
[2:03:46] said something my kid said no dad you
[2:03:48] said that wrong I said no I didn't
[2:03:53] what is this thing
[2:04:00] hello hello
[2:04:02] anyway
[2:04:07] I've said something and my kid said dad
[2:04:10] you said it wrong no I didn't
[2:04:12] I look at you know Amos we yeah Dad you
[2:04:15] blew it yeah uh you know Rebecca yeah
[2:04:17] Dad no I didn't
[2:04:19] you just heard it wrong
[2:04:23] sometimes I wish I had a a recording
[2:04:26] going full time but then
[2:04:28] I'd have to eat crow now and then oh
[2:04:31] yeah I'm sorry I did yeah
[2:04:33] but I thought I said it right
[2:04:36] so don't take what I said take what I
[2:04:40] thought
[2:04:43] right
[2:04:44] because we've all done it we've all made
[2:04:46] mistakes now I'll tell you what's
[2:04:47] happening within the message let me
[2:04:49] throw this out here so that you
[2:04:50] understand there's a lot of people that
[2:04:52] are seeing I had a brother call me from
[2:04:54] Ecuador yesterday
[2:04:56] he said brother Ron different ones
[2:04:57] ministers are leaving the message
[2:04:59] because of little discrepancies of what
[2:05:03] brother Branham said uh you know he made
[2:05:06] a mistake here he made a mistake over
[2:05:07] there or something well how many of us
[2:05:09] don't make mistakes
[2:05:10] okay well they made your own little
[2:05:13] things and say well if he was a prophet
[2:05:14] of God he did and let me give you a
[2:05:17] quote brother Brown said I've I have
[2:05:19] showed to you today
[2:05:21] in the Bible that all of God's Prophet
[2:05:24] make mistakes but God makes no mistakes
[2:05:28] you know I love that God shows us
[2:05:31] that Moses made a mistake
[2:05:35] now I don't Rejoice over the fact that
[2:05:37] he made a mistake but I realize that a
[2:05:39] is human
[2:05:39] man if he made a mistake like that and
[2:05:42] him being a prophet following the pillar
[2:05:44] of fire what about me little on me man I
[2:05:46] make mistakes oh I got hope God there is
[2:05:49] still hope
[2:05:50] amen because we all make the little
[2:05:53] mistakes and and so little discrepancies
[2:05:55] they said well uh something about 3 500
[2:05:58] people in uh in India there's no way it
[2:06:02] could have been 3 500 people
[2:06:05] well I want to ask you a Biblical
[2:06:06] question
[2:06:07] Jesus fed how many people with fishes
[2:06:11] and Loaves
[2:06:14] five thousand
[2:06:15] how do you know it's five thousand
[2:06:19] that's a round number
[2:06:21] do they have somebody click click click
[2:06:23] click click click click click click yeah
[2:06:26] Jesus five thousand
[2:06:33] what if it was only 400
[2:06:35] 4853
[2:06:38] would you freak out nah
[2:06:41] don't stop it
[2:06:43] why in the world do we let here's what I
[2:06:47] make the challenge I said show me in his
[2:06:49] Doctrine where he's wrong

[2:08:31] way I see it and yes I have I have
[2:08:34] over studied at times and I've over kept
[2:08:39] job on the ash sheep longer than I

[2:09:02] in my relationship with God
[2:09:06] that's what stimulates me huh I do I'm
[2:09:11] in love with him and this message more
[2:09:15] than I've ever been

[2:09:24] it does
[2:09:25] it's like wine it gets stronger
[2:09:30] every day with Jesus
[2:09:34] sweeter than the day before
[2:09:36] [Music]
[2:09:42] I'm going to say this in closing
[2:09:45] I came up
[2:09:48] in a pretty rough neighborhood childhood
[2:09:53] did a lot of things wrong as a young boy
[2:09:55] got in the wrong crowd
[2:09:57] [Music]
[2:09:59] raised up in Los Angeles
[2:10:02] [Music]
[2:10:06] and
[2:10:08] I went to a Bible study Mitch Buckingham
[2:10:10] asked me to go to a Bible study
[2:10:13] gave my heart to the Lord and for four
[2:10:15] years in high school I tried doing right
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:20] wow
[2:10:21] you know do you know what church the
[2:10:24] first
[2:10:25] church that I went to that I called the
[2:10:27] man my pastor
[2:10:29] any of you ever heard of Chuck Smith
[2:10:31] Calvary Chapel
[2:10:34] wow
[2:10:36] it was just a small little church
[2:10:38] small and you know what it was
[2:10:41] it was just a bunch of hippies and
[2:10:43] Surfers and long-haired and you know
[2:10:45] what the thing that I loved about Chuck
[2:10:48] is Chuck loved God
[2:10:51] it emanated from me
[2:10:55] and we went there
[2:10:57] and now they've got something out called
[2:10:59] the Jesus Revolution
[2:11:04] the Jesus Revolution
[2:11:06] they showed a bunch of hippies and
[2:11:08] long-haired
[2:11:09] everybody coming to church and how that
[2:11:13] it changed from a denominational
[2:11:15] Viewpoint to
[2:11:17] bringing all of these in and man all of
[2:11:21] a sudden his church just bow exploded
[2:11:28] I was part of the Jesus Revolution
[2:11:33] I was a counselor for Billy Graham
[2:11:35] Crusade
[2:11:36] 1969 Anaheim Convention Center the
[2:11:40] largest crusade in the history of Billy
[2:11:42] Graham crusade for young people
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:49] I still have the letter
[2:11:52] I had even for years even the the badge
[2:11:57] and the paraphernalia that you wear
[2:12:02] because I was a counselor for Billy
[2:12:04] Graham Crusade
[2:12:06] but I got disillusioned because
[2:12:09] of false teaching
[2:12:12] because I was sincere you talk about
[2:12:14] sincere
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:16] we passed out tracks
[2:12:19] we
[2:12:21] you guys what's that the Rose Parade
[2:12:25] Pasadena California largest parade in
[2:12:28] the world I believe
[2:12:30] Rose Freight it's in it is an all-night
[2:12:33] party the night before if any of you
[2:12:37] so we as young people
[2:12:39] our parents would let us go and we
[2:12:42] stayed up all night and guess what we
[2:12:44] did
[2:12:45] we passed out tracks
[2:12:51] about Jesus Christ all night
[2:12:54] we prayed for people
[2:12:56] that's how sincere we were
[2:12:59] I was part of the Jesus Revolution
[2:13:03] but now I'm part of the Jesus evolution
[2:13:07] why because God what he did he took me
[2:13:09] higher
[2:13:11] he took me out of the nonsense
[2:13:14] and showed me that I need to be more in
[2:13:16] love with him and I realize the long
[2:13:19] hair's got to go
[2:13:21] all of the different things because when
[2:13:23] God washes you he washes you from the
[2:13:26] inside to the outside Jesus on the
[2:13:29] inside working on the outside oh what a
[2:13:34] change
[2:13:35] amen I love you guys thank you
[2:13:39] for allowing me as your pastor to take
[2:13:42] some things and teach it
[2:13:44] and please don't ever think I'm going
[2:13:47] after anybody I'm not God knows my heart
[2:13:50] I
[2:13:51] I just want to teach you the whole
[2:13:53] counsel of God
[2:13:55] [Music]
[2:13:56] amen
[2:13:58] so I finished with this this here
[2:14:02] when I listen to the tapes and I read my
[2:14:06] Bible and I listen to the or I read
[2:14:08] those books
[2:14:10] they bring me to familiar places
[2:14:14] does that thought did I transfer that
[2:14:17] thought over to you somebody say I got
[2:14:19] it
[2:14:20] because it's happening to you too
[2:14:27] when I went to Israel
[2:14:30] and we toured Israel
[2:14:33] brother Joshua mukibai you just came
[2:14:35] back from Israel
[2:14:37] you toured you walked where Jesus walked
[2:14:41] I will tell you something Supernatural
[2:14:43] happened to me
[2:14:44] when I walked through the valley where
[2:14:46] David killed Goliath
[2:14:51] it's still a field
[2:14:54] has a little Uprising on one side and
[2:14:57] Uprising on the other and they told us
[2:14:59] hey go ahead we got about an hour go
[2:15:01] ahead and go out in here and just do
[2:15:03] your thing and as I walked out there and
[2:15:05] here's the where the old Brook used to
[2:15:08] be
[2:15:09] and I walked out into that and brother
[2:15:11] Robert I found I started looking for
[2:15:14] five smooth stones
[2:15:19] and I gathered five
[2:15:21] smooth stones
[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:25] and all of a sudden
[2:15:27] [Music]
[2:15:34] I was there
[2:15:36] there's Goliath
[2:15:39] there's the Philistines
[2:15:42] there's the army of Israel
[2:15:46] I can't tell you what it was it was a
[2:15:49] Division I don't know
[2:15:51] all of a sudden I just knew
[2:15:54] I was there
[2:15:56] how many of you when you hear the story
[2:15:58] of David
[2:16:00] and you hear of him going after Goliath
[2:16:05] you realize
[2:16:07] that story is familiar to me
[2:16:10] I believe that story why because you
[2:16:15] were a c Gene you were a germ when David
[2:16:18] killed Goliath you were with him when he
[2:16:21] he cut off his head when he held it up
[2:16:24] and Philistines fled you were there
