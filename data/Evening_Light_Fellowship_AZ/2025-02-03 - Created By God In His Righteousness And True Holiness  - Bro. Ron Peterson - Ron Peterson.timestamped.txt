[15:26] morning brother
[15:30] good morning Saints morning thank you
[15:33] for giving me a minute just to give
[15:34] share a testimony with you that's really
[15:36] fresh for us a couple of them my wife
[15:38] just got back from Back East she's been
[15:40] back there caring for mother I wanted to
[15:41] thank you Saints for your prayers for
[15:43] which is my mother-in-law my wife's
[15:45] mother sister Donna Phillips so it's
[15:47] tomorrow will be a month that she fell
[15:49] down the stairs there and and broke five
[15:51] ribs but the medical people said 100 the
[15:54] odds of pneumonia are 100% when you're
[15:57] 87 years old and You' broken five ribs
[15:59] and and it's because I've had broken
[16:01] ribs too it's really you don't want to
[16:03] breathe deep you just breathe shallow
[16:04] you don't want to move you and so at
[16:06] that age if you're not breathing deep
[16:08] and you're not moving they say 100% so
[16:11] that's pretty scary odds but thank God
[16:13] for the power of prayer and we thank you
[16:15] for your prayers and she Elizabeth was
[16:18] kind of the drill sergeant for her she
[16:19] had her doing laps around the living
[16:21] room every day she wasn't allowed to sit
[16:22] in the rocking chair she did 50 or 60
[16:25] laps a day she had a little chart she
[16:26] had to check them off as she went and uh
[16:30] and she's her lungs are clear it's a
[16:32] month now she's she'll be out of danger
[16:34] and so we're thankful for
[16:36] [Applause]
[16:38] that I saw brother Amos when I came in I
[16:41] know he's been under quite a strain with
[16:43] his business there and and I've been
[16:45] remembering him in prayer all so daily
[16:47] and uh I saw him this morning he thumbs
[16:49] up he said it's going excellent the
[16:51] Lord's on the scene so thankful for that
[16:53] too but let me give you this testimony
[16:54] from just yesterday oh let me read you
[16:56] this brother R says oh if you only knew
[16:59] that in your hand Christ gave us the
[17:02] authority with his name by being
[17:04] Christians the most powerful weapon the
[17:07] world has ever known prayer it changes
[17:12] everything so we if you live in Arizona
[17:14] you know that our water table has been
[17:16] dropping for 20 years uh um we drilled
[17:19] well almost 30 years ago there at the
[17:21] ranch it was 35 gallons a minute and
[17:24] excellent well but for years and years I
[17:26] noticed 20 years ago we were diminishing
[17:29] 12 years ago we were at 3 gallons a
[17:31] minute from 35 and it's continued to
[17:33] drop so we were at the point recently
[17:37] where we were making a little less than
[17:39] one qut a minute which is only 14
[17:42] gallons an hour so very the well was
[17:44] basically dry so we redrilled this week
[17:48] and the new well was we don't have a
[17:50] pump in it so it couldn't say for sure
[17:52] but the well drillers said very low
[17:53] production well but I'm thankful for
[17:55] anything it wasn't dry um but let me
[17:58] give you I'll just read this cuz it'll
[17:59] make it more concise this is
[18:01] my little testimony I put on our family
[18:05] chat here last night at 10:30 last night
[18:08] so this is pretty
[18:13] fresh I have a testimony that is beyond
[18:16] any scientific explanation it is a
[18:19] miracle straight from the hand of God
[18:21] I'm ashamed to say that I can be a bit
[18:23] of a skeptic and my faith is often quite
[18:25] weak I remember eight years ago when the
[18:27] goodwi fire swept through here I'll
[18:30] always remember the morning that the
[18:31] fire reached our property line when
[18:33] Wesley and I got on the quad to take the
[18:35] back route out of here and my faith was
[18:37] very weak I said to Wesley everything we
[18:40] have is going to burn to the ground
[18:42] there will be nothing left so this is a
[18:45] precious memory that I'll have forever
[18:46] Wesley said dad even if it wasn't God's
[18:49] will to preserve our property he would
[18:51] change his mind because so many Saints
[18:53] are
[18:57] praying one week ago you were all
[18:59] gracious enough to ask the Lord's
[19:00] blessing on our new well we were
[19:02] drilling as you recall I told you 10
[19:04] days ago that our well had been
[19:06] diminishing for years and was the worst
[19:08] ever currently at less than one Court
[19:09] per minute I know this well like an old
[19:12] friend for years now I have regularly
[19:14] tested the output and kept a chart in
[19:17] recent history I can tell you that in
[19:18] March of 2022 we were at 8/10 of a
[19:21] gallon per minute October of 2023 down
[19:24] to6 gallons per minute August of 24.5 55
[19:29] Gall per minute and Jan this January 202
[19:32] 5.23 Gall per minute so this has been
[19:35] our worst month ever with the well only
[19:38] producing 14 gallons per hour so we
[19:41] couldn't even Seth and Jessica are there
[19:42] from Canada told they can't give the
[19:44] kids little short bass don't fill the
[19:46] tub up you know and and so here's the
[19:49] testimony this afternoon I went this is
[19:51] yesterday this afternoon I went down to
[19:52] the Wellhead to do another volume test
[19:54] for the test I bypass the safety switch
[19:57] and kick the pump on full-time in less
[19:59] than 10 minutes the water's all pumped
[20:01] out and the pump starts sucking air I
[20:03] then turn the pump off let the well
[20:04] recharge for 15 minutes done this for
[20:07] years turn it back on and check the
[20:09] volume today after 10 minutes it was not
[20:12] sucking air after an hour it had still
[20:14] not pumped dry it's been on this is
[20:17] 10:30 last night it's been on now for 8
[20:19] hours and it's still not sucking air the
[20:23] Lord I checked our storage tanks and we
[20:24] have pumped 1,00 gallons in the last 8
[20:27] hours this is an
[20:29] impossibility the impoverished well was
[20:31] only producing 112 gallons in 8 hours
[20:35] just a week ago it could be proposed
[20:38] that the new drilling activity affect
[20:40] affected the old well that's what the
[20:42] devil would like to tell you but there's
[20:45] no chance of that the new well is on the
[20:47] farthest northeast corner of our
[20:49] property 60 Acres away from this one wow
[20:52] hope was quite excited that's my little
[20:54] granddaughter hope she's 6 years old six
[20:56] or seven she was quite excited when went
[20:58] down with me all afternoon regularly to
[21:00] check the output she said to me we were
[21:03] all praying for the new well and the
[21:05] Lord healed the old one too hallelujah
[21:09] thank you Lord I'm so humbled and
[21:11] thankful to the Lord for a supernatural
[21:13] intervention and then this morning I put
[21:15] on our family chat this morning's update
[21:17] our 3,000 gallons of storage tanks are
[21:20] full in the water is overflowing onto
[21:22] the
[21:23] ground it's so surreal
[21:32] it's to me it's so surreal to be in the
[21:34] middle of a supernatural event that's
[21:37] right it really is your hand your head
[21:38] kind of it's real though it really
[21:43] is amen God answers prayer if you have a
[21:46] need once again hold it before the Lord

[45:59] have you here this morning also galatian
[46:02] chapter 2 if you'll turn in your Bibles
[46:05] please galatian 2:
[46:09] 18 verses 3
[46:17] and9 for if I build again the things
[46:19] which I destroyed I make myself a
[46:24] transgressor for I through the law law
[46:27] am dead to the
[46:28] law that I might live unto God Amen I am
[46:33] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[46:36] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[46:40] in the Life which I now live in the
[46:42] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[46:45] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[46:48] thank you Lord I do not frustrate the
[46:52] grace of
[46:53] God for if righteousness come by by the
[46:58] law then Christ is dead in vain that's
[47:02] right oh my what a
[47:07] scripture for if righteousness come by
[47:10] the
[47:12] law then
[47:14] Christ died in
[47:16] vain Romans chapter 3 if you would
[47:19] Romans 3 verses 20- 28
[47:35] therefore by the Deeds of the law there
[47:37] shall no flesh be justified in his
[47:41] sight for by the law is the knowledge of
[47:44] sin amen but now the righteousness of
[47:48] God without the law is
[47:51] manifested being witnessed by the law
[47:53] and the prophets even the righteousness
[47:56] of God
[47:57] which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
[48:00] all and upon all that
[48:02] believe for there is no difference how
[48:05] many of you believe amen even the
[48:08] righteousness of God which is by faith
[48:12] of Jesus Christ unto
[48:16] all verse 23 for all have
[48:19] sinned and come short of the glory of
[48:22] God
[48:23] Amen being justified freely by his grace
[48:27] through the Redemption that is in Jesus
[48:30] Christ whom God has set forth to be a
[48:34] propitiation through faith in his blood
[48:37] to declare his
[48:39] righteousness for the remission of sins
[48:42] that are pass through the forbearance of
[48:45] God to declare I say at this time his
[48:49] righteousness that he might be just and
[48:52] the justifier of him which
[48:54] believe in believeth in
[48:57] Jesus where is boasting then it's
[49:00] excluded by what law or of Works nay but
[49:05] by the law of Faith somebody say the law
[49:07] of Faith the law of Faith it's a law
[49:12] amen therefore we conclude that a man is
[49:16] justified by faith without the Deeds of
[49:19] the law praise the Lord go to Ephesians
[49:23] now if you would for a
[49:25] moment Ephesians chap
[49:34] 4 that you put off concerning the former
[49:38] conversation of the old
[49:40] man which is corrupt according to
[49:43] deceitful
[49:45] lust and be renewed by the spirit of
[49:48] your
[49:49] mind that you put on the new man yes
[49:53] which after God is created
[49:57] in the
[49:58] righteousness and true Holiness amen
[50:01] notice this
[50:03] creation put on the new
[50:06] man which after God is
[50:10] created in
[50:12] righteousness and true Holiness thank

[51:12] in the presence of the
[51:14] Lord amen I would like to take my title
[51:17] I've got quite a bit here this morning
[51:22] um and so uh I don't wish to go quickly
[51:27] but I want to do it efficiently amen
[51:30] amen and so I'd like to title my sermon
[51:34] this morning created by God in his
[51:38] righteousness and true Holiness praise
[51:41] the Lord talk about the stature of a
[51:43] perfect man that's it
[51:47] created by God yes he's the author and
[51:52] the finisher of our faith that's right
[51:55] created by by God in his
[51:58] righteousness and true Holiness oh thank
[52:02] you Lord you talk about The Great
[52:08] Exchange he became
[52:15] me that I might become
[52:18] him how many believe that how many of
[52:21] you say that's me
[52:24] amen it's not by works of of
[52:26] righteousness thank you but by his grace
[52:29] alone hallelujah
[52:31] amen and I would like to take a subject
[52:34] this
[52:36] morning of the righteousness of God Amen
[52:40] I've been meditating on this thought
[52:43] for the past couple days and thinking
[52:47] about the righteousness of
[52:50] God and its effect upon the
[52:55] believer and and when we look through
[52:57] the scriptures we recognize that God is
[52:59] a holy
[53:01] God and he is a righteous God and
[53:04] Holiness and righteousness go
[53:11] together and no man shall be able to
[53:14] dwell in the presence of God without
[53:19] being holy and
[53:22] righteous in his
[53:25] sight icus 19: 1 and 2 the Bible says
[53:29] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[53:32] Speak unto all the congregation of the
[53:34] children of Israel and saying unto them
[53:37] ye shall be holy for the Lord your God
[53:42] am Holy for I the Lord your God am Holy
[53:46] Amen in Hebrews
[53:48] 12:14 follow peace with all men and
[53:51] Holiness without which no man shall see
[53:54] the Lord Lord
[53:57] 2 Corinthians
[53:59] 7:1 having therefore these promises
[54:02] dearly
[54:03] beloved let us cleanse ourselves from
[54:06] our from all our filthiness of the Flesh
[54:10] and spirit perfecting Holiness in the
[54:14] fear of God how do we perfect our
[54:18] Holiness how is it that
[54:20] we get to where we can be perfect in the
[54:25] eyes of God
[54:27] because I'll tell you when we try to do
[54:30] this in our human flesh we fall
[54:34] miserably so I want to take you a little
[54:37] bit higher I want to I want to take a
[54:40] fear away from some of you about your
[54:43] walk with God and how that you see your
[54:47] faults and failures but I don't want to
[54:50] look at it from carnal perspective
[54:52] through human eyes through human efforts
[54:56] but but I want to look through Godly
[54:58] eyes and how the god perceives you
[55:02] amen
[55:08] us the Bible says that without Holiness
[55:11] no man shall see God so what is Holiness
[55:14] how do we get
[55:16] it Webster defines holy as being the
[55:20] result or attribute that belongs
[55:24] to and is derived from being associated
[55:30] with a divine power oh
[55:36] Hallelujah so what it's doing is it's
[55:38] creating a union between man and
[55:42] God and
[55:44] Holiness is
[55:47] derived from being associated with the
[55:50] divine power praise the Lord hallelujah
[55:53] amen
[55:56] it's regarded with or worthy of worship
[55:59] or
[56:00] veneration it also means living
[56:03] according to a strict or highly moral
[56:06] religious or spiritual
[56:08] system becoming
[56:11] saintly also means specified or set
[56:16] apart for a religious purpos amen all of
[56:21] these things are the definition of being
[56:24] holy amen
[56:27] holy in Greek actually comes from hagos
[56:31] which means sacred it means physically
[56:35] pure morally
[56:37] pure
[56:39] blameless it means consecrated before
[56:44] god
[56:45] wow how can we become only all of
[56:51] the above attributes all pertain to the
[56:54] Christian in his walk with God right it
[56:57] is his Union and association with God
[57:00] that makes him holy amen remember it's
[57:03] not you being holy it's him being holy
[57:06] God's not looking at you he's looking at
[57:09] your
[57:10] [Applause]
[57:14] lamb there is nothing within yourselves
[57:17] that you can do to make yourselves holy
[57:20] it's the association with the divine
[57:24] power praise the Lord
[57:27] that's what makes us
[57:29] holy it's not doing the things that God
[57:32] tells us to do that makes us holy that
[57:36] just shows we become
[57:38] obedient doesn't make you holy makes you
[57:41] obedient
[57:44] amen it is the Revelation that comes
[57:47] from God that makes the Christian
[57:52] holy Revelation is the
[57:54] divine power power from God that
[57:58] transforms The Believer from carnal to
[58:02] spiritual and yes brother Russell we are
[58:05] sometimes
[58:07] skeptical we can see what God does for
[58:10] others but a lot of times with ourselves
[58:12] ah yeah well it's just that way might as
[58:15] well drill another hole and this and
[58:18] that and everything instead of praying
[58:19] over the old one but you know what you
[58:22] have not because you ask not amen you
[58:25] know God has done Miracles around Wells
[58:29] from Genesis to Revelation that's
[58:34] right and then God just comes along and
[58:37] goes from 2 to so many gallons per
[58:40] minute until let things
[58:42] overflow am
[58:45] Hallelujah I think I'd have had a
[58:47] jubilee and run around that that water
[58:49] tank i' have been shouting and glory to
[58:54] God because he's super
[58:57] natural he's a supernatural God and your
[59:01] union with him has Associated you with a
[59:05] divine power and that power is what's
[59:08] going to deliver you it is that power
[59:10] that is changing you prise the Lord amen
[59:14] thank you
[59:16] Jesus man all or carnal knowledge only
[59:19] conforms you yeah I know what to do yeah
[59:24] I know yeah I should do this yes I know
[59:27] see that's carnal knowledge that doesn't
[59:30] keep
[59:32] you head knowledge produces
[59:34] self-righteous
[59:36] Works Revelation from God transforms you
[59:41] thank you it's not you doing it because
[59:44] someone told you to do it it's because
[59:46] it was revealed to you once it's
[59:49] revealed to you you don't have to tell a
[59:52] sister not to cut her hair once it's
[59:55] revealed to her
[59:59] case dismissed amen it's over it's done
[1:00:02] I got it let's go to the next one see
[1:00:05] what I'm saying once you catch one thing
[1:00:09] and God reveals it to you then what he
[1:00:11] does is he said are you ready for step
[1:00:14] two are you ready for the next thing
[1:00:16] because I want you to come up higher I
[1:00:19] want you to understand this message that
[1:00:21] has come from God yeah was sent by God
[1:00:25] so that you might know your position in
[1:00:28] Christ that you might ascend from this
[1:00:31] carnal life down here into the very
[1:00:35] heavenlies being caught up together
[1:00:38] Hallelujah do you understand this is not
[1:00:41] Creeds dogmas traditions of man it's not
[1:00:45] long dresses uncut hair uh washed faces
[1:00:50] that is all
[1:00:52] works but the reason that you do what
[1:00:55] you do is because God revealed to you
[1:00:59] Holiness he revealed to you those things
[1:01:03] and when you give it back to God God
[1:01:06] cannot
[1:01:07] deny his own word that's right praise
[1:01:11] the
[1:01:16] Lord
[1:01:19] hallelujah Hebrews 4 and 2 for unto us
[1:01:23] was the Gospel preached as well as unto
[1:01:26] them remember them in the first
[1:01:29] Exodus but the word preached did not
[1:01:31] profit
[1:01:33] them not being mixed with faith in them
[1:01:37] that heard
[1:01:38] it what we're lacking among the church
[1:01:41] within the messages today around the
[1:01:43] world is Holy Ghost
[1:01:46] Revelation that's the power that will
[1:01:48] transform the
[1:01:49] church many of the Believers have
[1:01:51] conformed to the
[1:01:54] message but it's not been physically or
[1:01:58] let me call it spiritually revealed to
[1:02:00] them in their
[1:02:02] soul you've been conformed you've been
[1:02:04] molded under
[1:02:07] pressure and take the pressure off how
[1:02:10] would you live if there was no one
[1:02:12] around to see the way you're living amen
[1:02:16] good question than you Lord would you
[1:02:18] still believe what you believe if you
[1:02:20] were the only one and there was no one
[1:02:22] else around
[1:02:26] or would
[1:02:30] you
[1:02:34] compromise because everyone else around
[1:02:36] you will hey you know their definition
[1:02:40] of what a Christian will do when they
[1:02:42] look at you with a long dress and you
[1:02:46] men trying to do what's right not going
[1:02:48] out there and drinking and partying with
[1:02:51] the rest of them cuz that's culture I I
[1:02:53] want you to understand we in America
[1:02:55] have a
[1:02:57] culture yeah it's it's our culture eat
[1:03:00] drink and be merried for tomorrow we
[1:03:03] die Africa has a culture India has a
[1:03:07] culture Philippines has a culture but I
[1:03:10] want you to realize that when you come
[1:03:13] to Christ you have something greater
[1:03:14] than
[1:03:16] culture it's not your culture that rules
[1:03:19] you it's not your C culture that that
[1:03:23] rules the way you have a wedding amen
[1:03:26] well it's our culture come on since when
[1:03:30] does our culture come in here and keep
[1:03:33] us from having a wedding that is Holy
[1:03:37] before
[1:03:40] God it's our American culture here in
[1:03:44] America that hey without uh without
[1:03:46] being a Christian and Holy Ghost filled
[1:03:48] and trying to do what's right go to a
[1:03:51] worldly
[1:03:53] wedding they have open bar have dancing
[1:03:56] and music and it's just a big freefor
[1:03:59] all that's
[1:04:02] culture I want more than culture I want
[1:04:05] relationship with
[1:04:10] him now let's look at another scripture
[1:04:13] in 1 Peter chap 1: 13- 16 wherefore G up
[1:04:19] the loin of your mind amen and be sober
[1:04:22] and and hope to the end for the grace
[1:04:25] that
[1:04:26] is be brought unto you at the revelation
[1:04:30] of Jesus Christ as obedient
[1:04:34] children not fashioning yourselves
[1:04:37] according to the former lust and your
[1:04:40] ignorance but as he which called you is
[1:04:44] Holy so be ye holy in all manner of
[1:04:48] conversation because it is written be ye
[1:04:51] holy for I am Holy amen amen
[1:04:56] now Paul admonishes the Roman Church let
[1:04:59] me show you in Romans 10 1-4 Brethren my
[1:05:04] heart's desire and prayer to God for
[1:05:06] Israel is that they might be saved it's
[1:05:10] talking about all of Israel amen for I
[1:05:13] bear them record that they they have a
[1:05:15] Zeal for
[1:05:17] God but not according to
[1:05:19] knowledge wouldn't it be some to have
[1:05:22] all this Zeal and no knowledge of why
[1:05:24] you're doing what you're doing right so
[1:05:27] they had all the the Zeal about keeping
[1:05:30] the law and washing the cups and washing
[1:05:32] your hands and saying prayers and all of
[1:05:35] this stuff and it became a ritual that's
[1:05:38] right so he
[1:05:40] says verse three for they being ignorant
[1:05:43] of God's
[1:05:45] righteousness and going about to
[1:05:47] establish their own
[1:05:49] righteousness having not submitted
[1:05:52] themselves unto the righteousness of God
[1:05:55] amen for Christ is the end of the law
[1:05:59] for righteousness to everyone that
[1:06:02] believeth
[1:06:04] amen Christ is the end of the law for
[1:06:09] righteousness in other words it's none
[1:06:11] of your works of righteousness that you
[1:06:14] can do but it's what Christ has done for
[1:06:18] you oh Hallelujah man's always tried to
[1:06:20] earn his way to
[1:06:22] heaven always uh thought about how
[1:06:26] perhaps he can make a way for eternal
[1:06:31] life keeping the laws and
[1:06:34] Commandments tends to produce
[1:06:36] self-righteous people yeah this message
[1:06:40] unfortunately unfortunately is filled
[1:06:43] with many self-righteous Believers true
[1:06:46] I'm glad I'm not like that guy come
[1:06:50] on looking down at everybody else
[1:06:54] instead of looking down let's look up
[1:07:02] am I spoke to Harold Becket the other
[1:07:05] day about visiting him in South Africa
[1:07:08] which I'm not going to be able to have
[1:07:09] the opportunity when I go this Easter to
[1:07:13] go visit him but he's always got cliches
[1:07:17] stick with your pastor you'll grow
[1:07:19] faster you know
[1:07:21] uh leave your pastor nothing but
[1:07:24] disaster
[1:07:26] and he says you know brother Ron he says
[1:07:28] when I look down I get depressed but
[1:07:30] when I look up I get
[1:07:34] inspired amen so it just depends on
[1:07:37] which way you're looking let us not look
[1:07:39] down at somebody else or I'm glad
[1:07:41] measuring ourselves by ourselves we're
[1:07:44] not wise that's right some of your own
[1:07:47] children will come home with their
[1:07:49] report card and say I did better than uh
[1:07:52] 30% of the kids in the class
[1:07:56] or whatever and they you know I remember
[1:07:58] my daughter Rebecca uh every time she
[1:08:01] was bringing home her uh uh her
[1:08:05] test it was amazing cuz every every one
[1:08:08] of them was 100%
[1:08:10] 100% and Sandy asked Rebecca one time
[1:08:13] well do you ever make an error yeah but
[1:08:16] I don't bring those tests
[1:08:20] [Applause]
[1:08:22] home I just want you to know when I got
[1:08:24] 100%
[1:08:28] it was so different than
[1:08:30] Matthew Matthew said uh you know we he
[1:08:34] had a pretty low grade and I said Matt
[1:08:36] what's the deal well I I I've got a
[1:08:40] better grade than three other kids in my
[1:08:42] class see the his sights were not so
[1:08:46] high that's right because you're
[1:08:48] measuring yourselves by
[1:08:50] yourselves you don't become wise instead
[1:08:54] of looking at one another let us look to
[1:08:56] Christ he is the measuring post by which
[1:08:59] all of us should be measuring ourselves
[1:09:02] not looking at
[1:09:03] others but looking to
[1:09:09] him
[1:09:11] right as I read to you there in Romans
[1:09:18] 10 he said I want all of Israel to see
[1:09:21] but he says for being ignorant of God's
[1:09:24] righteousness
[1:09:26] and going about establishing their own
[1:09:28] righteousness how sad having not
[1:09:31] submitted themselves unto the
[1:09:35] righteousness of God for Christ is the
[1:09:38] end of the law for
[1:09:40] righteousness to everyone that believes
[1:09:42] I
[1:09:43] want I want to hand you something this
[1:09:46] morning spiritually speaking I want you
[1:09:49] to
[1:09:50] understand that what Christ has done for
[1:09:54] you and
[1:09:56] the price he has paid yeah and what he
[1:10:00] has given to you makes you into his
[1:10:08] righteousness amen wow amen
[1:10:12] right how can he do
[1:10:15] it so we'll look into
[1:10:20] this if your works could gain you the
[1:10:24] right to eternal life life then Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ died in
[1:10:28] vain we're not here to try to build
[1:10:31] another Tower of Babel that we might
[1:10:33] earn our way or make our way unto heaven
[1:10:38] but God has provided to you an access
[1:10:42] into the heavenlies that you might
[1:10:45] attain to a higher place than where
[1:10:47] you're at now thank you Lord hallelujah
[1:10:51] you have an access that access is
[1:10:54] through Christ Christ amen he said I am
[1:10:57] the way and the truth and the life and
[1:10:59] no man comes to the father but by me but
[1:11:02] through him and in him is the access
[1:11:05] because he said I am the
[1:11:12] door
[1:11:15] Hallelujah keeping the law and
[1:11:17] Commandments of God many times makes us
[1:11:20] self-righteous people
[1:11:25] if we're not careful we'll turn this
[1:11:27] message into Creeds and
[1:11:31] dogmas we will we just become religious
[1:11:34] we'll become a modern-day
[1:11:38] menonite okay because we all dress the
[1:11:41] same way we all act the same way we all
[1:11:43] go to church etc
[1:11:46] etc but just as the Pharisees and the
[1:11:48] sades the religious leaders of the world
[1:11:53] of that in that day took the word of God
[1:11:56] and turned it into
[1:11:59] Traditions oh
[1:12:01] God help us especially we ministers that
[1:12:04] we never bring it down to traditions and
[1:12:08] Creeds and dogmas
[1:12:11] amen Isaiah picks this up in Isaiah 64:
[1:12:15] 4-6 for since the beginning of the world
[1:12:18] men have not heard nor perceived by ear
[1:12:22] neither hath the eye seen oh God beside
[1:12:26] thee what he hath prepared for him that
[1:12:29] waiteth for
[1:12:31] him thou meet us him that rejoices and
[1:12:35] worketh
[1:12:37] righteousness those that re remember
[1:12:39] thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth
[1:12:43] for we have sinned in those is
[1:12:47] continuance and we shall be saved for we
[1:12:51] are all as an unclean thing and all out
[1:12:55] our righteousness are as filthy rags
[1:13:01] am and we all do fate as a
[1:13:04] leaf and our iniquities like the wind ha
[1:13:08] taken us
[1:13:09] away God does not impute his
[1:13:12] righteousness to to us through the
[1:13:15] lawkeeper that's
[1:13:17] right if you have broken any of his laws
[1:13:20] if you say well I live by the Ten
[1:13:23] Commandments I have kept ke the law
[1:13:25] since my
[1:13:30] youth if you have broken any laws or any
[1:13:34] Commandments then you become the breaker
[1:13:36] of all of his laws that's right because
[1:13:39] the Bible says in James 2 and 10 for
[1:13:43] whosoever shall keep the whole
[1:13:45] law and yet offend in one point he is
[1:13:48] guilty of all amen wow now I want to ask
[1:13:52] you which one of you is without guilt
[1:13:55] yeah I never murdered anybody yeah but
[1:13:58] did you talk about
[1:13:59] them I never committed adultery yeah but
[1:14:03] did you look with a lustful eye do you
[1:14:06] see what I'm saying pretty soon now if
[1:14:08] you're
[1:14:09] guilty in one part you're guilty of all
[1:14:11] so now we've all sinned and come short
[1:14:14] of the glory of God but the gift of God
[1:14:17] is eternal life through Jesus
[1:14:21] Christ thank you Lord and for the wages
[1:14:25] of sin is death but the gift of God
[1:14:27] through Jesus Christ is eternal life
[1:14:30] hallelujah amen you talk about a great
[1:14:32] exchange amen huh I gave him my old
[1:14:36] tattered garment he gave me a robe of
[1:14:39] pure wire thank you Jesus that's what
[1:14:42] the father of the prodigal son
[1:14:45] did when he saw his son yet a far off
[1:14:48] and he turned and came to
[1:14:51] himself and while he was yet a far off
[1:14:54] the father saw
[1:14:55] him coming he said kill the fatted calf
[1:14:59] get the robe get the ring Hallelujah I
[1:15:02] wanted to have a feast but some
[1:15:05] self-righteous brother who had never
[1:15:07] done wrong said you never did it for
[1:15:09] me how many times do we have attitudes
[1:15:12] rise up within a church of people that
[1:15:16] don't rejoice when the prodigal comes
[1:15:18] home amen help us lord well I you never
[1:15:23] did that for me and I I've never gone
[1:15:26] well come on quit being self-righteous
[1:15:28] let us rejoice even as the Heaven and
[1:15:32] the angels do Rejoice at a sinner that
[1:15:35] comes to repentance hallelujah
[1:15:39] amen sir God help us to all have the
[1:15:42] right kind of attitude
[1:15:47] yes Paul is a Pharisee had kept the
[1:15:53] law but but when Grace was revealed to
[1:15:56] him concerning the keeping of the law he
[1:15:59] considered all he had done in keeping
[1:16:02] the law as
[1:16:06] D let's take a look at that in the
[1:16:09] scriptures if you don't mind well look
[1:16:10] at Philippians
[1:16:12] 3 did I give you that scripture to read
[1:16:15] brother Mark Philippians

[1:16:31] Christ Jesus and have no confidence in
[1:16:33] the flesh no confidence in what flesh
[1:16:37] that's right though I might also have
[1:16:39] confidence in the flesh if any other man
[1:16:41] thinketh that he hath whereof he might
[1:16:44] Trust In the Flesh I more if you think

[1:20:43] Works let's go
[1:20:45] beyond your
[1:20:48] birth let's go back into the very mind
[1:20:50] of God when God slain the lamb before
[1:20:55] the foundation of the world and before
[1:20:57] you were
[1:20:58] born come on like that he showed between
[1:21:02] Jacob and Esau Jacob have I
[1:21:05] loved
[1:21:09] yes and before they were born and before
[1:21:12] Works were even done I put an elective
[1:21:14] love upon him and I gave him my
[1:21:18] righteousness
[1:21:20] Hall God wasn't looking at the failure
[1:21:24] of Jacob because Jacob was a Shyer and
[1:21:27] let me say this every one of you I'm
[1:21:30] going to take your Halo away from you
[1:21:32] this morning and say yeah you might be a
[1:21:34] good churchgoer but you know what that
[1:21:37] ain't good
[1:21:40] enough it's
[1:21:42] him
[1:21:46] thank the
[1:21:48] Lord our righteous
[1:21:52] am Jehovah s
[1:21:57] k Isaiah 61: 10-11 and I will greatly
[1:22:01] rejoice in the Lord and my soul shall be
[1:22:04] joyful in my God for Heath clothed me
[1:22:07] with the garments of
[1:22:10] Salvation he hath covered
[1:22:15] me oh my
[1:22:18] God what a
[1:22:22] work just as the the father of the
[1:22:26] prodigal son got the robe yeah look at
[1:22:31] this and he hath clothed me with the
[1:22:36] robe of
[1:22:40] righteousness as a bridegroom now he's
[1:22:43] he's liking this unto a a union between
[1:22:46] a bridegroom and a
[1:22:48] bride as he deth himself with ornaments
[1:22:52] and as a bride adorne herself with with
[1:22:55] her Jewels for as the Earth bringeth
[1:22:57] forth her bud in other words the Earth
[1:23:00] is going to bring forth the fruition of
[1:23:03] what I meant it to be because every seed
[1:23:06] will bring forth of its own kind if
[1:23:09] you're God's seed you can only produce
[1:23:12] God
[1:23:15] fruit praise the
[1:23:20] Lord so the Lord God will cause
[1:23:22] righteousness
[1:23:25] and praise to sing
[1:23:27] forth before all the nations amen praise
[1:23:32] the Lord the righteousness of God is his
[1:23:35] doing it's not yours
[1:23:39] right he will cause righteousness and
[1:23:42] praise to Spring forth somebody say
[1:23:44] he'll do it he'll do it that's it he's
[1:23:48] done
[1:23:52] it keeping the law without a
[1:23:56] revelation it just leans towards Creeds
[1:23:59] dogmas
[1:24:01] self-righteousness makes man-made
[1:24:03] standards
[1:24:04] regulations how long is long how short
[1:24:07] is
[1:24:09] short amen but when a revelation strikes
[1:24:13] your heart and it's revealed to you the
[1:24:15] believer then the Holiness is not
[1:24:19] self-manufactured amen it's god-given
[1:24:21] where'd you get it God
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:34] a woman can wear a long
[1:24:36] dress does that make her
[1:24:39] holy because if a long dress makes a
[1:24:42] woman holy I remember one of the few
[1:24:46] countries that I'd ever gone into and we
[1:24:49] landed in in La next to
[1:24:52] Vietnam and all all of them had
[1:24:58] dresses all of the
[1:25:00] women walking down the
[1:25:03] streets were in
[1:25:05] dresses long
[1:25:07] dresses they had long
[1:25:10] hair and the only ones that you saw that
[1:25:14] were perhaps having a problem with it
[1:25:17] was the young youth coming
[1:25:23] up but what I'm saying now if you want
[1:25:26] to say that being covered up makes you
[1:25:30] holy then the Muslims have got you
[1:25:33] sisters beat hands
[1:25:37] down because they cover themselves head
[1:25:40] to toe and they wear uh uh a burka or
[1:25:44] whatever is over the top of their head
[1:25:46] and that just their eyes show and some
[1:25:47] of them don't even show eyes they got a
[1:25:49] little
[1:25:52] screen how would you like to have that
[1:25:54] religion here in Phoenix at 120° and
[1:25:57] walk down down the
[1:26:02] street what I'm saying if it is just the
[1:26:07] dress that makes you
[1:26:09] holy then others have got us beat amen
[1:26:13] so it's not the long dress it's not the
[1:26:16] uncut hair right it is a revelation of
[1:26:20] why you do that thank you Lord
[1:26:28] God does not
[1:26:30] recognize the works of man unless
[1:26:32] they've been energized by the revelation
[1:26:35] of
[1:26:36] God without faith it's impossible to
[1:26:39] please
[1:26:40] God then it's no longer viewed as
[1:26:43] self-righteous but as his
[1:26:46] righteousness the Apostle Paul
[1:26:47] understood what it meant to be
[1:26:50] holy Now understand what he's trying to
[1:26:52] tell us from the following scripture
[1:26:54] he's going to show there two different
[1:26:57] kinds of Holiness one is man-made
[1:26:59] according to the the law and the other
[1:27:02] is the law of
[1:27:05] faith in the Philippian Church
[1:27:09] age watch this they sought their
[1:27:13] righteousness after the law and failed
[1:27:18] miserably for by the law can no flesh be
[1:27:22] justified
[1:27:24] by the law can no man be made holy
[1:27:27] Holiness is of the Lord amen are we
[1:27:31] together on that so let's keep reading 1
[1:27:34] Corinthians
[1:27:36] 1:30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus
[1:27:40] who of God has made unto us wisdom and
[1:27:43] righteousness and sanctification and
[1:27:46] Redemption second Corinthians
[1:27:51] 521 that we might be the righteousness
[1:27:55] of God in
[1:27:57] him now here's a prophet rightly
[1:28:00] dividing the word of the the Lord and
[1:28:03] God is showing you through a prophetic
[1:28:05] voice yeah oh I'm so glad that my
[1:28:09] Holiness is not myself
[1:28:13] right I am glad that I am in Christ and
[1:28:16] with all his wonderful attributes of
[1:28:18] righteousness imputed yay imparted unto
[1:28:21] me blessed be God forever amen amen yes
[1:28:25] there he stands the Lord Of Glory once
[1:28:28] says the father he was surrounded by
[1:28:31] Angels and Archangels cheram seraphim
[1:28:34] and the whole host of Heaven crying holy
[1:28:37] holy holy is the Lord God of hosts such
[1:28:41] was his Holiness that no man could
[1:28:43] approach un him but now we see him in
[1:28:46] the church sharing his own Holiness with
[1:28:51] us thank you Lord
[1:28:55] thank until in
[1:28:58] him
[1:29:02] wow Lord are you reading
[1:29:06] that until in
[1:29:10] him we become the very righteousness of
[1:29:13] God oh
[1:29:15] hallelujah thank you Lord yes there he
[1:29:19] stands
[1:29:21] Jesus perfect everything
[1:29:24] lily of the valley the bright and
[1:29:26] Morning Star fairest of 10,000 Alpha
[1:29:30] Omega root and offspring of David Father
[1:29:33] Son and Holy Ghost the
[1:29:35] all and all let me read this again but
[1:29:39] now we've seen him in the
[1:29:41] church sharing his own Holiness with us
[1:29:45] praise the
[1:29:46] Lord wow
[1:29:50] Lord I don't know about you
[1:29:54] but when I read this it shook me
[1:29:58] up I thought wow could this be
[1:30:03] true that God you love me and you love
[1:30:07] me
[1:30:08] enough to share your
[1:30:11] righteousness that you took upon
[1:30:14] yourself my
[1:30:16] sinful everything that I've ever done in
[1:30:19] thoughts and attributes and complexes
[1:30:21] and issues I've had in life
[1:30:24] and you nailed it to the cross and for
[1:30:27] by grace are we saved through faith and
[1:30:30] that not being of ourselves what faith
[1:30:33] it is a gift of God lest anybody should
[1:30:38] boast W thank you
[1:30:43] Lord so the Holiness and
[1:30:47] righteousness that the Believers have
[1:30:49] does not come by the keeping of the
[1:30:51] law but by the revelation of the Holy
[1:30:55] Ghost do all Christian women I'm going
[1:30:58] to ask a question do all Christian women
[1:31:01] wear dresses and modest
[1:31:03] apparel nope just the Holy Ghost LED
[1:31:08] ones you understand just those who are
[1:31:13] LED of the Holy
[1:31:15] Ghost because you can wear a long dress
[1:31:18] and it be immodest
[1:31:22] amen that's why even the Hollywood
[1:31:25] Jezebels at their reward Banquets or
[1:31:28] whatever they call these Emmys and all
[1:31:31] of this stuff most of them wear immoral
[1:31:35] dresses right long dresses
[1:31:46] yeah see when the spirit reveals it to
[1:31:50] the
[1:31:52] believer When Faith strikes her
[1:31:56] heart it's added to the foundation oh
[1:32:00] thank you Lord add unto your faith
[1:32:03] virtue and unto virtue knowledge and
[1:32:07] unto knowledge Temperance unto
[1:32:11] Temperance godliness until you come unto
[1:32:15] the stature of the Perfection of Christ
[1:32:19] I want you to understand that it's not
[1:32:21] the things that we do but the things
[1:32:22] that God has done for us and yet we are
[1:32:25] obedient because L we say okay well if
[1:32:28] that's it and I'm so predestinated I can
[1:32:31] live any way I want to never get that in
[1:32:33] your mind because if you are
[1:32:35] predestinated if you are ordained of God
[1:32:38] if you are elect you will be obedient
[1:32:42] Sons and Daughters of
[1:32:51] God God does not receive every
[1:32:56] sacrifice are we together on that
[1:32:59] amen because if just sincerity is all
[1:33:02] that God requires he would have received
[1:33:05] Cain's offering right but when God did
[1:33:10] not receive
[1:33:11] it what did he do he got mad what do
[1:33:15] people do today when you tell them that
[1:33:18] without Holiness no man shall see God
[1:33:20] they get
[1:33:20] mad well that's not the kind of God that
[1:33:23] I believe
[1:33:24] been I have a God that let me do
[1:33:26] anything and it's just by grace and it's
[1:33:28] all Grace and therefore I can do
[1:33:30] anything I want and that kind of creeps
[1:33:32] right down within the
[1:33:34] message oh God help us to be obedient
[1:33:37] Sons and Daughters of
[1:33:43] God 1954 brother Bren preaches a sermon
[1:33:46] called God perfecting his
[1:33:49] church so we give God praise tonight to
[1:33:52] know that the the holy spirit is in us
[1:33:55] last night I was teaching of the
[1:33:59] Perfection God perfecting his church
[1:34:02] bringing the church into Perfection
[1:34:05] through the Lord Jesus Christ where is
[1:34:07] it coming through the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:11] do you see this
[1:34:13] Union do you see this association with
[1:34:16] the divine
[1:34:18] power that how we being dead in Christ
[1:34:21] take on Abraham's seed our a
[1:34:24] according to the promise and we are
[1:34:25] perfected not in our own self not in our
[1:34:28] own Holiness my somebody said to me not
[1:34:31] long ago brother Brenham do you believe
[1:34:33] in Holiness I said yes sir without such
[1:34:36] no man shall see God I said but not my
[1:34:38] Holiness amen cuz I have not any I
[1:34:43] believe it's his
[1:34:45] Holiness something that he has done yes
[1:34:49] and that I rest my hopes upon not on my
[1:34:53] own merits I have not how many of you
[1:34:56] are with him I got no
[1:35:02] marriage the whole thing
[1:35:04] becomes a love
[1:35:06] affair oh
[1:35:09] Hallelujah Jesus
[1:35:11] said if you love
[1:35:16] me you keep my Commandments
[1:35:20] amen that's why we live obedient yes
[1:35:25] amen otherwise we can preach
[1:35:28] predestination and Grace to such a
[1:35:31] degree it becomes
[1:35:35] disgrace true true doesn't matter how
[1:35:38] how you dress doesn't matter what you do
[1:35:42] it's all Grace yeah brother Brenham said
[1:35:45] when you start thinking like that it's
[1:35:47] nothing but
[1:35:49] disgrace
[1:35:52] true now now brother Bram says in God
[1:35:56] hiding himself in Simplicity then
[1:35:58] revealing himself in the same so God
[1:36:01] hides himself then he reveals himself in
[1:36:04] what
[1:36:05] Simplicity he says now in a Highway of
[1:36:08] Holiness people try to make themselves
[1:36:11] holy and when you do it's just like I
[1:36:13] said like a it would be a buzzard trying
[1:36:17] to put in Dove feathers and himself make
[1:36:20] a dove out of it when his Nature's still
[1:36:22] a buzzard
[1:36:24] it would be like a crow trying to put in
[1:36:26] Pigeon feathers or a peacock saying you
[1:36:28] see I'm a beautiful bird see it's
[1:36:31] something manufactured but a peacock
[1:36:33] don't have to worry whether he's going
[1:36:34] to have a peacock feathers or not
[1:36:39] right the dove don't have to worry
[1:36:41] whether he's going to have Dove feathers
[1:36:43] or not as long as the nature is a dove
[1:36:47] he will have Dove
[1:36:52] feathers and the Hess people began to
[1:36:54] say the women must wear long hair and
[1:36:58] long sleeves and all these things and
[1:37:00] long skirts and not wear any wedding
[1:37:03] rings or jewelry of any type see it
[1:37:05] becomes self-righteous Holiness amen
[1:37:09] right that's what's manufactured
[1:37:12] Holiness that comes from the inside out
[1:37:15] that's automatically
[1:37:17] lived the Sheep don't have to
[1:37:19] manufacture wool right
[1:37:23] you don't see a
[1:37:26] sheep out in the field chewing the grass
[1:37:31] all worried about his
[1:37:38] wool it's just going to come that's
[1:37:41] right praise the Lord it ain't something
[1:37:44] he makes
[1:37:46] up he doesn't have to go to the Sheep
[1:37:49] clothing
[1:37:50] store right and buy some real fine
[1:37:55] wool
[1:37:56] no he just lives he
[1:38:00] eats and he
[1:38:02] lives what does a Christian do yes eat
[1:38:06] and live amen you don't manufacture
[1:38:09] it but I'll tell you what when he inside
[1:38:13] of you begins to show you the way you
[1:38:16] live it's not you manufacturing it's God
[1:38:20] showing you the type life you live and
[1:38:22] when you give it back to God God says
[1:38:24] that's righteousness
[1:38:26] amen praise the
[1:38:32] Lord I believe that the enemy is
[1:38:35] constantly
[1:38:37] attacking the message Believers
[1:38:39] concerning our
[1:38:41] Holiness true because if he can get you
[1:38:44] to
[1:38:46] compromise and get you to lower the
[1:38:49] standard he doesn't stop with just
[1:38:51] lowering the standard well how short
[1:38:53] short is short how long is
[1:38:58] long you see pretty soon it's a tape
[1:39:01] measure religion amen right okay we
[1:39:06] can't manufacture
[1:39:09] it now in Galatians 3: 1-9 oh foolish
[1:39:14] Galatians who hath Bewitched
[1:39:17] you that you should not obey the truth
[1:39:20] before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been
[1:39:23] ly set forth crucified among
[1:39:26] you this only would I learn of you
[1:39:29] received ye the Spirit by The Works of
[1:39:32] the law or by the hearing of
[1:39:36] Faith are you so foolish having begun in
[1:39:40] the spirit and Y and ye now made perfect
[1:39:44] by the
[1:39:46] flesh have he suffered so many things in
[1:39:49] vain if it be yet in vain he therefore
[1:39:53] that ministereth to you in the spirit
[1:39:55] and work the Miracles among you do he do
[1:39:59] it by The Works of the law or but by the
[1:40:01] hearing of Faith even as Abraham
[1:40:04] believed God and it was accounted to him
[1:40:07] for
[1:40:08] righteousness know ye therefore that
[1:40:11] they which are of Faith the same are the
[1:40:14] children of
[1:40:16] Abraham and the scriptures foreseeing
[1:40:19] that God would justify the Heathen
[1:40:21] through faith preach before the gospel
[1:40:24] unto Abraham saying in these shall all
[1:40:27] the nations be blessed so then they
[1:40:29] which be of
[1:40:31] Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham
[1:40:36] amen we talk about Revelation being the
[1:40:39] power of
[1:40:42] transformation I found this quote and
[1:40:44] it's quite as
[1:40:45] astounding in Revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:40:49] in the church age book chapter 1 if
[1:40:52] Revelation is beyond
[1:40:54] you look up and seek God for
[1:40:58] it very good none of you are exempt from
[1:41:02] this true well it's too hard I can't
[1:41:04] attain it no if it seems to be Beyond
[1:41:08] you look
[1:41:11] up and seek God for it amen that is the
[1:41:15] only way you're ever going to get it a
[1:41:18] revelation has to come from God it never
[1:41:22] comes by human or natural endowment but
[1:41:25] by spiritual
[1:41:26] enduement in other words it's God that's
[1:41:29] doing it you can even memorize the
[1:41:32] scripture and though that's wonderful
[1:41:34] that won't do it it has to be a
[1:41:36] revelation from God it says in the word
[1:41:39] that no man can say that Jesus is the
[1:41:42] Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have
[1:41:47] to receive the Holy Ghost and then and
[1:41:50] only then can the spirit give you
[1:41:52] revelation
[1:41:53] that Jesus is the
[1:41:56] Christ God the anointed one
[1:42:01] amen remember now the words of
[1:42:06] Jesus seeking
[1:42:09] first
[1:42:10] yeah the kingdom of God look at this in
[1:42:14] Matthew 6 therefore take no thought
[1:42:17] saying what you shall eat what you shall
[1:42:19] drink or wherewith All Shall you be
[1:42:22] clothed for all all these things do the
[1:42:24] Gentiles
[1:42:26] seek for your heavenly father knoweth
[1:42:28] that you have need of all these
[1:42:31] things but seek first the kingdom of God
[1:42:35] and his righteousness and all these
[1:42:37] things shall be added unto you so seek
[1:42:41] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:42:44] righteousness and all these
[1:42:47] things you want to know how to get
[1:42:51] ahead die to sell
[1:42:58] amen it's not our
[1:43:00] righteousness it's not our keeping the
[1:43:03] Commandments it's not how good and moral
[1:43:06] we can live but it's God giving us his
[1:43:09] own
[1:43:10] righteousness see I want you to
[1:43:13] understand what's happening when you
[1:43:14] hear the word of God there's a
[1:43:15] supernatural transformation taking place
[1:43:18] it's a
[1:43:20] metamorphosis it is God is changing
[1:43:23] changing you yes we're being changed
[1:43:25] from Glory into Glory because there is
[1:43:28] the glory of this terrestrial but the
[1:43:31] glory that is greater is Celestial
[1:43:33] that's right are you understanding God
[1:43:36] says yes there's a glory of one and
[1:43:38] there's a glory of another God by the
[1:43:41] Revelation that he is giving you is
[1:43:44] changing you he's metamorphing you into
[1:43:47] a whole new creation in Christ oh
[1:43:50] Hallelujah
[1:43:57] changing us from Earthly to
[1:43:59] Heavenly from terrestrial to
[1:44:03] Celestial Revelation is the power of
[1:44:06] transformation God's looking at the
[1:44:08] Eternal seed that lies in
[1:44:10] you God cannot break his Covenant and
[1:44:12] brother Mario you did a tremendous job
[1:44:15] the other day you began to take that
[1:44:18] that unconditional Covenant God gave to
[1:44:20] Abraham didn't matter what Abraham did
[1:44:23] amen thank you
[1:44:26] Lord lying to save his own skin give his
[1:44:29] wife
[1:44:33] away tell tell tell that guy you're my
[1:44:37] sister otherwise he's going to kill me
[1:44:40] so she lies because he wanted her
[1:44:46] to yet you know what God
[1:44:50] intervened thank you Lord
[1:44:54] brother renham illustrates it and I
[1:44:56] think it's one of the funniest ones ever
[1:44:58] he says there was that King his hands
[1:45:01] behind his head he just taken a bath and
[1:45:04] there he is on his kingly bed king-sized
[1:45:07] bed his little toes Wiggly oh tomorrow
[1:45:11] I'm going to take this 90-year-old
[1:45:13] woman he
[1:45:16] says do you know only this message and
[1:45:19] brother meno you know this this is the
[1:45:21] only time that a prophetic understanding
[1:45:24] of the scripture that Abraham and Sarah
[1:45:28] were
[1:45:30] changed before the coming of the
[1:45:33] promised son they had to be changed just
[1:45:36] like you and I have to be changed these
[1:45:39] mortal bodies Hallelujah shall be
[1:45:41] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:45:45] eye
[1:45:46] Hallelujah and brother renov said he
[1:45:49] changed him back to being young
[1:45:53] again
[1:45:55] Hallelujah brother Brenham even reenacts
[1:45:57] he says
[1:45:58] Sarah oh your wrinkles are going away
[1:46:02] yeah well Abraham that hump in your back
[1:46:05] and the way you were walking you're now
[1:46:08] walking over
[1:46:11] yeah only the prophet there was no one
[1:46:15] else that came through the scriptures to
[1:46:18] show
[1:46:19] us why that this king would want to take
[1:46:24] Sarah it doesn't fathom he's he can have
[1:46:27] any woman in the Kingdom any young
[1:46:29] virgin I can have
[1:46:31] her he wants
[1:46:34] Sarah you can you just in your mind

[1:46:53] you better get some new
[1:46:56] glasses yet the prophet of God
[1:46:58] said there it is there's a mystery

[1:47:05] and meet the promised son they're going
[1:47:08] to be changed Hallelujah let me tell you
[1:47:11] this Chang is a whole lot closer than

[1:47:16] caught up is well listen we are in the
[1:47:20] phases of the shout The Voice the
[1:47:22] trumpet

[1:47:49] made sin for us who knew no sin that we
[1:47:54] might be the righteousness of God in him

[1:48:12] quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:14] energizes that seed brings it to life
[1:48:17] brother brandom says it's a deep calling
[1:48:19] to the Deep
[1:48:23] your theop has been calling
[1:48:27] you am come up a little
[1:48:31] higher into the revealed
[1:48:38] word the Bible says in Matthew 5 and6
[1:48:42] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:48:44] thirst after
[1:48:45] righteousness for they shall be
[1:48:50] filled blessed
[1:48:53] comes from the Greek word Macos which
[1:48:55] means blessed or

[1:55:09] food for the
[1:55:12] soul are we together on that yes sir

[1:59:43] the spirit of God and He To Whom the
[1:59:46] spirit of God reveals them we need to
[1:59:49] call on God for Revelation more than
[1:59:51] anything else is in the world Amen we'
[1:59:54] have accepted the Bible we accepted the
[1:59:57] great truths of it but still it's not
[2:00:00] real to most people because the
[2:00:02] Revelation by the spirit is not
[2:00:05] there the word has not been
[2:00:08] quickened the Bible says 2 Corinthians
[2:00:12] 5:21 that we have become the
[2:00:14] righteousness of God by our Union with
[2:00:17] Jesus Christ did you get it it says now
[2:00:21] brother random capitalize this we are
[2:00:24] the very righteousness of God himself by
[2:00:27] being in Christ am praise the Lord it
[2:00:31] says that he Jesus became sin for us
[2:00:34] amen it does not say he became sinful
[2:00:38] but he became sin for us that by our
[2:00:40] Union with
[2:00:41] him we might become the righteousness of
[2:00:45] God hallelujah if we accept that fact
[2:00:48] and we
[2:00:50] must that he literally became sin for us
[2:00:54] by his substitution for us then we must
[2:00:57] accept the fact that we by our Union
[2:01:00] with him yeah have become the very
[2:01:03] righteousness of God hallelujah praise
[2:01:06] the Lord to reject one is to reject the
[2:01:09] other to accept
[2:01:11] one is to accept the
[2:01:14] other it cannot be denied but the
[2:01:17] revelation of it is missing is not real
[2:01:20] to the majority of God's
[2:01:24] children it's just a good verse in the
[2:01:28] Bible what we need to have it made alive
[2:01:31] to us that will take
[2:01:35] Revelation do you see
[2:01:40] that to the
[2:01:42] majority of God's children it's not real
[2:01:45] just the nice verse

[2:02:15] invisible Union whereby the spirit of
[2:02:18] God energizes you quickens that seed and

[2:02:23] life because until then guess what to
[2:02:27] you without that life it's just
[2:02:33] rules amen it's just rules it's well the
[2:02:36] prophet said we can't do this and we
[2:02:38] can't do that and the Bible says this
[2:02:40] and you can't you can't you can't do you
[2:02:42] know that there are
[2:02:45] more Commandments of God that thou shalt
[2:02:48] than there is Thou shalt not why do we
[2:02:51] do dwell on the negative get into Christ
[2:02:54] and the rest of these things don't
[2:02:56] matter praise the

[2:10:32] to satisfy this Thirst by things that
[2:10:36] will not satisfy amen So
[2:10:42] True Religion tries to pacify the People
[2:10:45] by giving them entertainment

[2:11:26] the
[2:11:28] spiritual there's something about when
[2:11:30] you satisfy the natural man he gets
[2:11:33] hunger
[2:11:34] hungry again and again and again it's
[2:11:37] just a habitual
[2:11:39] thing but they that eat less and less of
[2:11:43] spiritual food have less and less
[2:11:45] appetite
[2:11:47] true and they which eat a great greater
[2:11:51] appetite in other words they start
[2:11:53] getting into that revealed word and they
[2:11:55] start eating it and they start eating

[2:12:06] prayer it increases you wanting to hear
[2:12:09] the word of God it increases your desire

[2:14:33] quenches your holy thirst theology won't
[2:14:36] do
[2:14:37] it entertainment won't do it and
[2:14:40] religion won't do
[2:14:42] it John 6:35 Jesus said I am the bread
[2:14:46] of life and he that cometh to me shall
[2:14:49] never hunger and he that believeth on on
[2:14:51] me shall never
[2:14:53] thirst the Lord John
[2:14:56] 7:37 and the last day that great day of
[2:14:59] the feast Jesus stood and cried saying
[2:15:02] if any man
[2:15:04] thirst amen
[2:15:07] yes amen
[2:15:11] amen If any man
[2:15:14] thirst let him come to me yes amen and
[2:15:18] drink and he that believeth on me as the
[2:15:21] scriptures said out of his belly shall
[2:15:25] flow rivers of Living Water even as
[2:15:28] brother Russell testified of a well that
[2:15:30] got dried
[2:15:32] up it was depending upon natural rain
[2:15:37] natural sources but guess what there's a
[2:15:39] supernatural
[2:15:41] God Hallelujah for the believer that can
[2:15:45] give water where there is no water he
[2:15:47] can bring water out of a rock that's
[2:15:50] right yes praise the Lord that's the
[2:15:53] kind of God we are why
[2:15:56] he's God our
[2:15:59] refuge amen Jehovah saidu our
[2:16:03] righteousness
[2:16:05] amen thank you
[2:16:10] Lord blessed are they that do hunger and
[2:16:13] thirst for
[2:16:15] righteousness for they shall be filled
[2:16:18] prise the Lord the Bible predicts in the
[2:16:22] end time there'll come a
[2:16:24] famine Bible says Amos 8 verse 11 behold
[2:16:27] the days come sayth the Lord God I'll
[2:16:30] send a famine in the
[2:16:32] land not a famine of
[2:16:36] bread nor a thirst for
[2:16:39] water but for hearing the words of the
[2:16:41] Lord yes they shall Wander from sea to
[2:16:45] Sea and from North even to the East and
[2:16:48] they shall run to and fro seek the word
[2:16:49] of the Lord and shall not find
[2:16:54] it on that day shall the fair virgins
[2:16:58] and young men faint for thirst we're in
[2:17:01] the midst of this prophecy my brother
[2:17:03] and
[2:17:04] sister the day will
[2:17:06] come and there'll be a famine in the
[2:17:10] land because too many of the people have
[2:17:13] been eaten off of the wrong thing
[2:17:15] amen God has sent to us a prophet see
[2:17:19] everything every one of our sermons all
[2:17:22] rev revolve
[2:17:25] around what God has done in this hour
[2:17:28] the
[2:17:29] revealing of the son of
[2:17:31] man who do you say this
[2:17:34] is right and you see all these scoffers
[2:17:38] let me take just a moment I may preach
[2:17:41] on
[2:17:42] this but all of these scoffers that are
[2:17:44] coming up well he this and that and they
[2:17:47] all got their own little thing and well
[2:17:49] if he was a real prophet he would have
[2:17:51] known about you know who this was
[2:17:55] and I'll tell you
[2:17:59] what these scoffers are coming up more
[2:18:02] and
[2:18:03] more it did
[2:18:05] it with every
[2:18:07] Prophet it did it with every move of
[2:18:11] God it did it with
[2:18:14] Moses you see jamus and jam was back
[2:18:17] when they were in Egypt but daythan and
[2:18:19] Kora was in the
[2:18:21] message and they were on the journey and
[2:18:24] they came to the place that Moses takes
[2:18:27] too much authority to
[2:18:28] himself are we not all holy and guess
[2:18:32] what God did you know what God said
[2:18:35] separate you but you know what Moses
[2:18:37] Christ in Moses stood in the
[2:18:40] Gap take me
[2:18:44] first then finally after that was all
[2:18:46] said and done God said separate yourself
[2:18:49] Moses because everything that
[2:18:51] appertaineth or believeth like Dayan and
[2:18:53] Kora I'm going to swallow him
[2:18:56] up I want you to understand that's
[2:18:58] what's happening now
[2:18:59] these daythan and
[2:19:01] koras these scoffers these
[2:19:05] mockers guess what the world is just
[2:19:07] opening it up just swallowing
[2:19:10] and because had they had true Revelation
[2:19:13] they'd have never listened all this
[2:19:16] stuff I was talking to the brothers in
[2:19:18] the back
[2:19:19] room what was brother wrong was brother
[2:19:22] Brenham wrong on the
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:26] godhead was was he
[2:19:28] wrong on the opening of the
[2:19:31] seals was he wrong on water
[2:19:36] baptism was he wrong on his doctrinal
[2:19:39] teachings they don't touch the doctrinal
[2:19:42] teachings they just come after well uh
[2:19:45] you know if if he'd have been a prophet
[2:19:48] in fact the disciples even said that
[2:19:50] about Jesus if he didn't know what kind
[2:19:52] of woman he's talking
[2:19:58] to on so these scoffers and these
[2:20:01] mockers of the end time I talked to a
[2:20:04] brother a pastor here about a week or 10
[2:20:06] days ago I told him I said stay away
[2:20:08] from that
[2:20:11] nonsense you get into this little
[2:20:13] YouTube and this little this and that
[2:20:15] and everything raising up and everything
[2:20:17] ah they're a bunch of scoffers Amen
[2:20:23] mockers they are the shimmy eyes within
[2:20:25] the message you want to throw dirt on it
[2:20:27] I tell you what they'd have never done
[2:20:29] it when he was here and he was alive
[2:20:32] amen he just said oh you you preachers
[2:20:34] oh all of you that are against me said
[2:20:36] you come up here and stand right here in
[2:20:39] this huh praise the Lord and he said ah

[2:20:45] thought so all of this stuff let them
[2:20:49] Yak let them talk just stay away from it
[2:20:53] but some of
[2:20:54] you are going to be disobedient kids you
