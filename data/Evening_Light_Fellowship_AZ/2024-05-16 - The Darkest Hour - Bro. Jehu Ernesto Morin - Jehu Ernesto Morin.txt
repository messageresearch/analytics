hermano frecuentemente cuánto tiempo Se predica qué una hora hora 20 minutos una hora está bien una hora yo una hora él es justo verdad yo quiero introducir en esta tarde a mi esposa quisiera que mi hermana Guadalupe se ponga de pie por favor Ella es mi esposa [Aplausos] siempre se pone muy nerviosa cuando yo voy a predicar y eso eso es bueno ella tiene nervio Yo estoy más tranquilo o sea somos un equipo hace algunos años creo como 36 años Yo estaba predicando en un lugar que se llama Richmond Virginia Entonces yo estaba predicando en inglés y yo pensé que había predicado bien cuando salimos allá fuera de la iglesia me dijo qué vergüenza destruiste el inglés no te entendí nada después viene una un hermano Hermano yo entendí tu predicación much digo dígale a ella Porque ella dice que no entendió desde hace tiempo entonces yo decidí predicar en español bien yo les invito a que se pongan de pie por agradezco a nuestro hermano ron la oportunidad que de prestarme su púlpito Pero principalmente nuestro señor Jesucristo por la vida que les da a ustedes por la vida que les da a ustedes y que me da a mí en esta hora de estar en el mejor lugar algunas personas están en la cárcel otros están en el hospital otros Quizá en la cantina algunos en el juego de béisbol o de fúbol o algunos trabajando pero a ustedes y a mí a ustedes y a mí nos ha tocado La mejor parte y es estar en la casa del señor y su palabra dice Yo me alegré con los que me decían a la casa de Jehová iremos por eso Estamos contentos en el libro de San Juan el capítulo 11 el versículo 17 dice su palabra vino pues Jesús yó que hacía ya cu días que Lázaro estaba en el sepulcro Vamos a orar padre celal estamos delante tu labios del que habla hagas a un lado su mente y que tu palabra venga señor que la inspiración venga que tu espíritu santo señor salga con tu palabra que tus hijos tengan oídos espirituales que les abra su entendimiento y que ellos puedan tomar su palabra que llegue a su corazón señor y que esta palabra les bendiga les Levante les fortifique les dé fuerza para el camino y que cada uno de nosotros Al escuchar tu palabra podamos glorificarte y pod darte gracias así como aquellos Caminantes deem que nuestro corazón señor Al escuchar tu palabra esa es nuestra petición esta lo pedimos en el nombre del señor Jesucristo pueden ustedes el momento más oscuro de la noche es un poco antes del amanecer nuestro tema en esta noche es la hora más oscura y cuando nosotros Hablamos de una hora oscura estamos hablando de tiempos difíciles de momentos de desilusión de momentos de desesperación un momento oscuro es como cuando alguien está en el hospital o cuando alguien va a hacer un análisis de su de su sangre y le van a decir la persona va nerviosa si es un examen decer o de alguna enfermedad delicada ve con el doctor y va temeroso en el anda preocupada Y es un momento oscuro el día de ayer una persona cercana a mí tuvo un accidente y cuando yo iba con con la persona a ver a la persona del accidente la persona iba nerviosa se sentía incómoda no sabía si llorar no sabía si hablar fuerte usted sabe se bloquean los sentidos Entonces los momentos difíciles vienen a nuestra vida y nuestro entendimiento nuestro razonamiento se bloquea no sabemos cómo actuar no sabemos qué decir y y cuando Nosotros hemos leído esta escritura cuando estamos hablando acerca de Lázaro en el sepulcro y aquí tenemos a dos personas más Marta y María profeta habla de ello y dice que le hablaron a Jesús y le mandaron un mensaje y le dijeron ven tu amigo Lázaro está muy enfermo y Tal parece que Jesús se fue un poquito más allá ahora él era amigo de ellos El Profeta dice viun os la esperanza de ellos estaba puesta en Jesús pi usted en esto tratemos de mirar ese lugar quizá era por la tarde y ellos habían estado preocupados por la salud de Lázaro diferentes personas creo que Lázaro no está poniéndose muy bien y va de mal en peor Marta y María estaban desesperadas y Tal parece que era un momento oscuro por porque no solamente era su hermano era el apoyo el soporte para la economía de la casa nos damos cuenta que la hora más oscura de tu vida tu mejor día la palabra del Señor nos dice en el libro de romanos 828 828 nos dice que todas las cosas ayudan a bien a los que aman a Dios Ahora nosotros pensamos qué de Bueno podemos sacar de un accidente qu de Bueno podemos sacar de una enfermedad buenar de un conflicto qué de Bueno podemos sacar de de una problema en el trabajo en nuestra mente se bloquea y nosotros no lo entendemos pero la hora más oscura de tu vida Dios está presente pero nosotros nosotros hermano tenemos imaginación tenemos conciencia tenemos razonamiento tenemos AF Y tenemos memoria pero Dios no trabaja con eso tenemos vista tenemos gusto tenemos tacto pero Dios no trabaja con eso Dios trabaja más profundo dentro del corazón del hombre hay una duda o hay una fe y Qué es la fe La fe es poder ver la fe es una revelación yo viene la fe señor no dice que la fe viene por el oír y el oír en la palabra de Dios conforme más Oyes conforme más escuchas conforme más lees conforme más tomas el mensaje algo se está anclando dentro de ti hay una revelación dentro de ti que tú sabes que sabes que sabes y estás seguro que él está contigo no lo sientes no lo ves Pero lo crees Por qué Porque él no anda por sentidos la La fe no viene por la fe no viene por sentidos la fe viene por creer en la palabra de Dios por qué su palabra dice que él es tu Amparo él es tu fortaleza que él es tu pronto auxilio en las tribulaciones Y si nosotros traemos esa palabra en el momento de nuestra tribulación el momento de nuestra angustia nosotros vemos a través de la escritura como David pudo expresar cuando é se sentía débil él dijo Por qué andaré yo enlutado porque yo andaré triste por la opresión del enemigo porque voy a andar de esa manera entonces é dice ahora recordaré es traer los eventos pasados al presente él dijo ahora recordaré có el señor sacó al pueblo de Egipto de Egipto Cómo cruzaron por el mar cómo pudieron cruzar por el mar cómo ellos se alegraron ahora me regocijaré en en lo que pasó hizo momentos más oscuros si nosotros vemos a través de la escritura nosotros vemos a un hombre llamado Sansón mató a más filisteos en su muerte ena un momento muy triste para Sansón era lo último pero pudo expresar una vez más señor él puso su confianza en el señor y dice la palabra del señor que él mató más personas en su muerte a través de de las etapas de su vida nosotros podemos ver a David David tuvo momentos difíciles en una ocasión vino León era una prueba muy dura era un momento de terror Pero qué fue lo que hizo en ese momento él se fue Se abalanzó en contra de León y nosotros vemos que después vino un oso era un momento muy difícil era un momento muy triste para él Ese oso quería robarse parte de sus ovejas pero en ese momento que parecía peor que parecía mal vino a ser unen día Endo iba en escala la prueba va en escala es como el día que va de Gloria en gloria de triunfo en triunfo Hasta que el día es perfecto el profeta nos habla y nos dice que todo creyente todo cristiano tiene que pasar por una lucha y una prueba todos los hijos de Dios tienen que ser probados tienen que pasar por eso para qué para que puedan ver la Victoria Si no hay una batalla si no hay una lucha no va a haber una victoria Y entonces nosotros vemos que después fue a pelear con Goliat él llegó simplemente de llevarle comida a sus hermanos porque su padre le había enviado ahí él llegó en el tiempo correcto y nosotros vemos Que Goliat estaba murmurando y Goliat estaba haciendo burla del pueblo y y él sintió eso y él dijo Quién es este incircunciso que está blasfemando que está hablando en contra del pueblo de Dios de los hijos de Dios él conocía su posición y era un momento triste sus hermanos vinieron y le dijeron nosotros conocemos tu corazón le dijeron en tu corazón hay soberbia has venido a burlarte has venido a ver esto y David dijo yo no he venido a esto é se sintió triste porque sus hermanos le estaban difamando Pero dijo yo puedo pelear con ese yo puedo hacerlo él tenía pruebas él tenía pruebas de que alguien había estado con él [Música] para él fue ir ahí con Go y cuando llegó con Go entonces tuvo un gran día lo que parecía triste lo que parecía angustioso lo que parecía que no tenía nada más que hacer de la tristeza Entonces ahora pas al gozo el pueblo estaba triste lastimado nosotros vemos A saul saul sus pies le temblaban sus rodillas chocaban Unas con otras y entonces él dijo Bueno yo no puedo pelear pero ahora nosotros vemos Que saul voltea y le dicen hay uno que puede pelear hay uno que quiere pelear y cuando lo trajeron él lo miró él solamente miraba a un jovencito 15 dijo tú ve Ahora él empezó a ensalzar el enemigo é dijo Aquel aquel es un guerrero des su juventud aquel tiene una espada aquel tiene una lanza del tamaño de un telar aquel es poderoso saul estaba exaltando a la persona equivocada Pero ahí estaba la persona correcta dijo Bueno no puedes ir allá pero entonces le dijeron si él no va Alguien tiene que irse dijo Bueno póngale mi casco póngale mi armadura denle mi espada Pero eso no era por porque ella tenía pruebas pruebas indudables pruebas firmes se había peleado con el oso habí y ahora venía la prueba final y parecía que era un día mu muy triste pero cuando él mató al Goliat Entonces el pueblo tuvo energía el pueblo tuvo gozo y el pueblo fue y peleó allá y ganaron la batalla nosotros podemos ver como Moisés en el tiempo más triste uno de susas pruebas era una prueba de angustia el enemigo estaba atrás el mal estaba enfrente no había donde ir nosotros vemos a través de la Biblia vemos a través del mensaje como el profeta habla y dice Por qué clamas di la palabra di la palabra es tu tiempo es nuestro tiempo para decir la palabra y quisiera citar esto como el profeta nos dice que usted cuando tiene la prueba cuando tiene la lucha dice el profeta más de 17 veces dice sí a Satanás Satanás Dios puede derrotarte en cualquier lugar en cualquier momento a cualquier hora y donde sea dice dice él Tómese esto estas frases no se le olviden dice profeta usted tiene poder tenemos poder para citarle a Satanás el escrito está Jesús le dijo en sus pruebas las tres pruebas que tuvo é dijo escrito está escrito está escrito está y con lo único que nosotros podemos vencer es con el escrito está en elro momento difícil podemos voltar y decirle al enemigo yo en el nombre del señor Jesucristo te voy a decir lo que me dijo un profeta Satanás estás Derrotado puedes pelear conmigo en cualquier lugar en cualquier momento en cualquier tiempo pero siempre estará Derrotado Porque allá en la cruz del Calvario señor Jesucristo le dio un tremendo golpe él pagó el precio por qué pagó el precio por tu salud por tu sanidad por tu salvación por tu redención tú eres un redimido Y por qué somos Redimidos por la sangre del cordero y qué Ese redimido es volver a nuestro estado original Pero tiene que pasar la lucha tiene que pasar esos momentos Oh es que yo no siento a Dios Oh es que me siento cansado Oh me siento desilusionado Oh siento que esto es difícil pero el profeta lo dice no es si lo sentiste Es que yo creo que soy parte de esa novia Yo creo que soy contado entre los Escogidos de Dios y me gusta esa palabra que profeta utiliza yo pertenezco yo soy la novia la señorita Jesucristo y la señorita Jesucristo no puede dar para atrás ella va hacia adelante ve entonces en el momento difícil para para Moisés en el más triste de todos sus y peores momentos en su prueba de angustia sucedió Dios le abrió el mar se abrió el mar y el profeta dice dice un escritor dijo dios miró con sus ojos el mar y el mar se hizo a lado y el pueblo inició a caminar piense en esto pi un momento triste de los jóvenes hebreos yenes hebos momento triste para os los trajeron y les dijeron Bueno ahora es su tiempo de ustedes a ustedes los encontraron haciendo esto no quieren arrodillarse y como no quieren arrodillarse entonces tienen que pagar el precio y el precio de esto es que tiene que ir al horno ardi puede usted imaginar eso un momento triste un momento de desilusión le ha pasado a usted que ha esperado ustedes madres han esperado a sus hijos han orado por sus hijos han orado por sus hijas y tal vez Tal parece que entre más oran entre más platican con ellos hacen lo contrario a lo que ustedes les dijeron Y ustedes dicen señor dónde estás allí está el señor parece un peor momento parece un momento muy nostálgico estaba viendo como el profeta habla de uno de sus momentos más tristes una de sus horas más oscuras dice yo estaba allí en la Clínica May y él lo predica en cre esto en el año 50 y él dice Estando yo í la Clínica Mayo cuando los mejores médicos entraron y dijeron reverendo bram No hay esperanza para usted y le dijeron usted nunca se recuperar de eso y le dijeron usted está acabado y dice la hora más oscura que alguna vez haya presenciado Y entonces llegó jes en ese momento que llegó dice é cuánto lo amo o cuando medito en esto y pienso cu es lo que él ha hecho por mí fue su Sublime Gracia la desesperación hermano en en una hora oscura usted empieza a pensar a pensar a pensar y usted Busca una solución aquí Busca una solución acá Busca una solución aquí y parece que todas las puertas se le cerraron y entonces hermano usted va con el amigo va con la persona todo se cerró pero hermano hay un cielo un cielo lleno de bendiciones un cielo lleno de bendiciones el profeta nos habla y nos dice todas las promesas de esta Biblia son para sus hijos hay un cielo lleno de bendiciones y profet menciona porque las promesas de Dios son perfectas son únicas las promesas de Dios llegan exactamente en su tiempo no en la hora que tú quieres no en el momento que tú quieres y en otro mensaje dice Tú tienes que entrar en desesperación y Qué es desesperación tienes que entrar en una urgencia en un estado de emergencia y Cuando entras en un estado de emergencia hermano ya no piensas tus sentidos ya no piensas tus afectos están yendo llega el momento que te bloqueas te cierras y empiezas a mirar Oh Señor Dónde estará mi socorro Dónde estará mi ayuda y entonces la escritura se ha yo soy tu Amparo yo soy tu pronto auxilio en tus tribulaciones porque él es el señor que sana todas nuestras dolencias en nuestros momentos oscuros cuál maravilloso dice el profeta cuando él llega en las horas más oscuras así está el sanador divino Allí está el sanador divino cuando Lázaro estaba vivo él está entrando disimuladamente en la ciudad y dice fíjese María Marta discúlpenme lea la historia ustedes ahí ustedes pueden ver cuando el señor llegó a ese lugar mar María estaba muy tristes dice profeta usted puede el momento más triste de mucha angustia su único hermano ya no estaba ahí qué hora tan oscura sacaron al hombre el profeta lo habla se loar y lo pusieron allá en una cueva abajo en el suelo y le pusieron una roca en lo cual es el típico entierro del Ori entonces pasó el primer día el segundo día el tercer día todos los gusanos de la piel empezaron a entrar empezaron a comerlo la primer cosa que se comieron fue la nariz y al rato empezó a corromperse y ap podrirse llegaron por ahí los insectos junto con los gusanos empezaron a devorar el cuerpo parte de su cuerpo a los cu días ya hay día ya díaa después a las 72 horas la corrupción comenzó todas las esperanzas se habían ido todo se había perdido pero ahí est y hab dejado su iglesia todo lo que tení allá estaba su hermano muerto el hombre en el cual habían depositado toda su confianza siendo el hombre más importante que andaba de aquí para allá andaba haciendo milagros en Aquel lugar y en el otro lugar en el otro lugar le mandaron un mensajito llegó el mensaje por esa persona que le habló dijeron de lo que estaba pasando Pero sabía lo que estaba pasando hebreos 138 nos lo dice Jesucristo es el mismo Ayer hoy y por todos los siglos ellos pensaron que lo habían abandonado y que se había ido no quiso venir cuando lo mandaron Buscar era la hora más oscura que la pequeña familia hab y más o menos era hora oscura entre más oscuro está Es cuando Jesús se hace presentea Es un poquito antes del amanecer es cuando llega la mañana Tenía que estar muy oscuro jes Tenía que est estar muy muerto porque Jesús es la resurrección Tenía que estar en un estado deplorable cansados un estado desesperanza porque Jesús es nuestra esperanza ten que estar en un estado de desilusión te ha desilusionado quizá tu esposo te ha desilusionado quizá tú has desilusionado a tus hijos quizá tus hijos sien desilusionados de ti Quiz hemos desilusionado al abuelo o al nieto o a la nieta pero eso es parte de la vida para que Jesús venga y empieza a dar una nueva vida era la hora más oscura en esta pequeña familia piense en esto Jesús llega y se hace presente y dice profeta podría ser su hora más oscura podría ser su peor día Oh llega al hospital y le dice te tienes que quedar aquí en el hospital y usted dice Pero por qué tenemos que hacer más exámenes y pasas una semana en el hospital no piensas en el dinero no piensas en tu carro no quiere salir sáquenme de aquí sáquenme ya pero allí estás es un momento oscuro pero nosotros Él es todavía nuestro sanador él todavía puede hacer eso pero él te está viendo él quiere ver tu reacción él permite una acción para ver tu reacción hermano en ocasiones nuestro temperamento nuestro temperamento sale Pero hermano quiere que salga lo último porque quiere formar un carácter y hermano y cuando nuestro temperamento sale sentimos que desilusion al Señor nos sentimos desilusionados desilusion de la dere de la izquierda Pero sabes una cosa Eso es parte del trabajo Eso es parte del proceso Dios te está viendo recordaba a un hermano que fue el hermano branam fue con un veterano del ejército fueron ahí donde estaban los abogados y el hermano se sentía muy triste el hermano br y le empezaron a decir es que usted dijo mentiras es que usted dijo Esto es que usted dijo esto otro y y el hermano que le acompañaba era un hermano con un temperamento muy fuerte y cuando le dijeron es que usted dijo mentiras y entonces el hermano se paró y dijo usted no puede volver lo vuelve a decir esto a mi profeta usted va a saber quién soy yo porque él es el siervo de Dios no vuelvo a decir eso en FR de m volteó a ver al hermano bran su cara se puso roja bajó la cabeza se sintió mal caminaron un poquito hacia y fue a disculparse con el hermano y el hermano Dios te permi decir eso a laa pi usted se sintió mal dice pero tu temperamento se va a ir Cuántos momentos han pasado [Música] nuestos vea esto Daniel El peor día y en su peor día lo llevaron a dónde al foso de los leones el profeta dice yo puedo ver cuando él está hablando acerca de sadr de los jóvenes hebreos y cuando é habla de Daniel dice yo puedo ver una escena allá en el cielo Dice el Ángel aeno él dice yo puedo ir a cambiar de si tú me permites le pidió permiso pidió la oportunidad de la gloria le dijo No y el profeta dice ahí estaba Miguel y Gabriel y dijeron podemos ser dijo no Y la situación se puso más difícil empezaron a caminar hacia donde estaba el horno ardiente y se miraban unos a otros y uno de ellos dijo aú les daban una oportunidad dijeron aú cuando nuestro Dios no nos libr de todas maneras no vamos a adorar ellos estaban parados era su vida era la vida de ellos y conforme iban caminando iban a la muerte hermano y las personas alrededor pobres hombres es el peor momento de la vida de esos tres hombres no quiero estar en el lugar de ellos no no quiero estar y se hicieron más para allá no se van a morir seguro van a ser quemados en un momento elor momento y dice el profeta dice Entonces cuando ellos cayeron ahí estaba alguien esperá en el peor momento de su vida Cuando cayeron ahí Ahí estaba él el mismo El poderoso conquistador ahí est ell y emp aaar ellos es real es verdad está en la escritura Tu peor momento va va a ser cambiado por qué Porque él tiene el poder Para qué para cambiar la atmósfera él nos dio poder Él nos dio autoridad usted tiene autoridad para cambiar la atmósfera ustedes son pequeños Mesías pequeños creadores de atmósfera si usted crea esa atmósfera si usted forma esa atmósfera dijo el Ángel le dijo al profeta si tú eres sincero y haces que la gente te crea creas esa atmósfera ni cá de la frente Por qué Porque toda la autoridad que estaba allá el señor la puso en Jesucristo y toda la autoridad que está en Jesucristo ahora está puesta en su novia ustedes son la palabra viviente Dios no tiene otras manos más que las de ustedes Dios no tiene otros pies más que las de nosotros Nosotros somos esa palabra nosotros fuimos traídos desde antes de la fundación del mundo no para ser perdedores no no no para ser unos detractores no para ser caídos nosotros fuimos traídos estábamos en el pensamiento de Dios éramos el pensamiento de Dios y fuimos expresados para qué Para ser hijos e hijas de Dios para ser vencedores pero la atmósfera usted tiene que tomar esa atmosfera esa atmósfera es de usted porque usted es creador cuando cayó allí empezó a platicar con ellos Oh hermano de la tristeza al mejor momento del peor momento a las alturas nosotros vemos a Daniel él caminó ahí porque era condenado porque él hacía oración porque era condenado porque él adoraba al señor porque cumplía con los servicios él abría las ventanas sus detractores ahí listos dijeron en eso él se va a equivocar en algo porque a él le gusta adorar su Dios A él le gusta ir a su iglesia Dónde puedes encontrar a Juan el miércoles por la noche o allá en la iglesia dónde lo puedes encontrar el domingo él no falla va a estar allí en la iglesia él va a llegar allí en la iglesia ahí lo puedes encontrar seguro Por qué Porque él es un adorador y nuestro señor anda buscando adoradores que le adoren En Espíritu y verdad Entonces ellos dijeron vamos a agarrar a Daniel este va a ser su peor día y llegaron y lo tomaron y lo llevaron ahí con el rey dijeron Bueno el edicto ya ha sido hecho lo sentimos por él está acabado mírale su cara sigió caminando él sabía

nombre del señor a él correrá el justo a él correrá el justo él va a cambiar no dice la Biblia que él va a cambiar nuestro lamento en gozo tiene que haber Un lamento tiene que haber una enfermedad para que hay un sanador tiene que haber un perdido para que haya un Redentor tiene que haber alguien que est necesitado para que él diga yo aquí estoy con quién contigo en los momentos más tristes en los momentos más oscuros en los momentos más desesperantes Oh Daniel Dios le dio su mejor día con quién se lo dio con los leones con los leones cerca de los leones kiri kiri kiri kiri kirii ki kiri kiri quién iba a creer eso dónde le dio su mejor momento a Sad mesak y abednego a los jenes hebreos se lo dio en el fuego en el Oriente Oh noces estamos nosotros aire acondicionado pero ahí les llegó el aire acondicionado el señor con ellos y luego dijeron el rey dijo no metieron tres yo veo cuatro Oh Daniel el rey llegó Daniel tu Dios te pudo salvar Rey estoy confortable puede pensar en eso puede pensar usted en Job llegó una persona se murieron tus pastores se llevaron tus camellos tus hijos se murieron una una tras otra tras otas otra qué fue lo que dijo él Jehová dio Jehová quitó sea el nombre de Jehová bendito Pero quién llegó su esposa su esposa llegó su amor dice la Biblia que el aliento de ella dice él Job dice su aliento de ella fue extraño a m o sea ella ya no nada ya no se acerc mirab palabras No amor Quieres car qué extraño llegó ella y le dijo maldice maldice a Dios y mu quién nos desilusiona o a quién des ilusionamos con nuestros hechos se acuerda cuando se casó amor pas recién casados escuch palabras bonitas mi fal un un momento tú falta tú lo hiciste Mira yo te lo dije te dije qué te dije que te iba a ir mal y te fue tenía razón qué le dijo Job le dijo como una mujer la amaba como una mujer fatua como una mujer fatua has hablado has hablado no es la manera que debes de hablar la amaba y después de eso el Señor miró eso y Job tuvo Victoria y Victoria Victoria señor le dio el doble estaba aquí estaba aquí ahora Estaba acá no se acercaban a él nadie nadie pero después lo puso allá pero él siguió siendo el mismo la misma persona hermano Jesús en la cruz del Calvario muerte resurrección todos ellos estaban tristes le dijo mujer tu hijo todos estaban tristes fueron a la tumba muy muy de mañana muy de madrugada así como ustedes llegan bien temprano voy a la iglesia bien temprano llegó dijeron dónde lo pusiste estaban tristes Dinos por favor dinos A dónde se lo llevaron Y entonces cuando él les miró le reconocieron inmediatamente su rodill y lo querían tocar Y entonces qué hicieron ellos de la tristeza al gozo salieron corriendo fueron con los discípulos Pedro Jacobo Juan Felipe rápido morimos resucitó no no resucitó no no resucitó Caminantes a emú Los Caminantes emú Ian tristes y se les aparejo el señor qué momento tan triste dijo para dónde van aquí arriba y se le quedaron mirando dijo qué les pasa es el rico extranjero aquí que no sabes lo que pasó no sabes de Jesús no has oído eso nosotros lo esperábamos nuestro Rey nuestro libertador habló palabras bonitas aquí palabras hermosas acá y luego lo mataron cómo quieres que estemos contentos y les empezó a hablar de las escrituras yo creo que les dijo se acuerda de Moisés se acuerda de Daniel se acuerda de los jóvenes hebreos se acuerda de Abraham y entonces ellos iban este sabe Este sí sabe y pero todavía ellos en su en su mente no pero pero unas mujeres nos dijeron unas mujeres que y llegaron a la casa y él hizo como que iba a pasar a veces así sucede hermano un hermano viene como que va a pasar Dígale Quédate a comer tacos con chil frijoles invítalo y Y entonces dijo no Quédate aquí y cuando él empezó a compartir el pan dice la palabra sus ojos fueron abiertos y el momento más triste lo vieron ahí y dice que en esa misma noche se regresaron Y fueron con los discípulos dijeron lo vimos ha resitado verdad Pero ahora ellos ya no andaban así cómo te va se dado cuenta cuando le preguntan a un hermano Dios te bendiga Cómo estás Cómo te va Estás contento Saben una cosa en ocasiones la cara no sabe que usted está alegre hay que enseñarle a la cara Dígale cara Pon cara de alegría ñ la cara o el problema se va a ir con su cara triste sabe cómo se va cuando Ed empieza a sonreír el dice te voy a quitar la paz no puedes quitarme la paz porque esa paz que yo tengo tú no me la diste el mundo no me la da el cor no me la dio el corno me la da esta Paz me la dio Jesús y un profeta vino un profeta dijo que podemos derrotar al en cualquier lugar a y entonces yo creo eso y esta Paz me la dio Jesús porque dijo mi paso dejo mi Paso soy pero no como el mundo la da Oh te pagaron Ho me pagaron andas con muy alegre compré un carro compré un carro compré un carro un mes con el carro lo lavas lo limpias Ay gracias Dios a los dos meses se te va la felicidad tengo que pagar la seguranza me la van a subir mi esposa me decía no compres el carro compr mirada ves cómo se te fue tu p pero la paz que da el señor el goo te da el Señor te hace saltar te hace levantar las manos te hace aplaudir porque ese gozo está dentro de tu corazón porque ese gozo está dentro de tu alma Oh Jesús estaba allí en la cruz Oh Ya murió pero resucitó entonces la hora más oscura cu hay ese dolor levántate saca la fuerza de dónde de la palabra toma la palabra agarra la palabra y tú di señor esto también pasará esto es pasajero porque tu palabra dice cielos y tierra pasarán pero tu palabra no pasará y mi confianza lo que veo no está en lo que siento no mi confianza está puesta en él en el que resucitó el Que pagó el precio vino con Satanás y le dijo Cuál es el precio Satanás le dijo tú sabes tú lo pusiste es sangre y él dijo Está bien lo tomo y él no redimió Y tomó el libro hermano le tomó el libro y ahora ese libro nos lo ha dado ahora ese libro es la palabra revelada se ha dado cada uno de ustedes Oh hermano decía hermano Apocalipsis 101 después nos pasamos a Apocalipsis 17 Pero después pasamos a 10 10 Ahora la novia tiene esa sustancia tiene esa autoridad quién se la dio Oh en ocasiones te pueden decir te crees mucho Te crees mucho Te miras muy soberbio te sientes grande no me siento grande soy grande por qué porque Dios y yo somos mayoría y hermano cuando Moisés iba a pelear el señor le dijo mi presencia era contigo no es lo que tú vas a hacer es mi presencia es su presencia dentro de ti Nosotros hemos visto a través de la palabra Dios sobre nosotros Oh ellos adoraban en la montaña Dios con nosotros Dios con nosotros pero ahora es Dios en nosotros pueden ustedes imaginarse a un Dios triste no sé cómo voy a arreglar el problema de este un d preocupado Ay cómo arreglaré la situación de este otro por qué Dios es perfecto Esa es la pregunta por qué Dios es perfecto porque él no sabe fallar porque él no está aprendiendo él no está aprendiendo no él es perfecto la primera la primera respuesta que da es la segunda que va a dar es la tercera que va a dar él no cambia su palabra porque su palabra dice yo Jehová no me no cambio no me mudo si te di la bendición hoy te la voy a dar hasta que mueras Y si te dice hijo desde antes de la fundación vas a ser hijo hasta llegar allá pero vas a pasar por la montaña por el valle por el desierto lleg Por qué Vas a llegar porque hay una Simiente la Simiente de Dios é la puso en nosotros y el enemigo quiere sacarla pero no puede es lo único que es ter rasca te rasca tu cuerpo porque tu cuerpo no fue redimido Entonces él te hace así pero él no puede tocar la Simiente que está dentro Porque esa Simiente es Dios mismo esa Simiente es Dios mismo piensen esto faraón no puso resistencia dijo no voy a liberar a Israel pero solo fue el propósito de Dios para que su nombre fuera glorificado el Mars rojo frente Israel representaba un obstáculo imposible de superar más Dios mostró su gloria sobre piensa en esto sin importar lo que puedas estar enfrentando Él te dice no temas No tengas miedo pero nosotros tenemos miedo cómo le voy a hacer ay ay ya llegaron los billes ay ay está muy lejos cómo le voy a hacer es que el doctor dijo estoy muy enfermo y El doctor dijo eso es muy buen doctor é no se puede equivocar y él dijo que estoy enfermo Estoy enfermo pero hay otro doctor que di Yo soy el señor Yo soy el señor que sana todas tus enfermedades todas tus enfermedades cáncer ceguera tuberculosis ponle una fuerte Póngale una la más fuerte cuál deme una que él no pueda sanar pero él quiere que tú pases por esos momentos para que puedas ver y puedas disfrutar termino con
