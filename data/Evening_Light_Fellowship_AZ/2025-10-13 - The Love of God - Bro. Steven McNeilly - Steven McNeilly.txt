He says, "We're so thankful for God's hand in Josiah's life and the blessing and joy that he brings to us. Just so thankful for what the Lord has done in little Josiah's life. Pray the Lord just continue to overshadow him and help him on his journey." Amen. God is good. Sister Nancy Tim P is has several preliminary appointments this week leading up to her infusion one week from tomorrow. Please pray that everything stays on track. Then she will make minim she will have minimal side effects after the infusion. So let's remember sister Nancy. Pray the Lord continue to be with her. Sister Josie Robas is asking prayer for her brother Arthur Arthur Banks. He's in hospice. So let's remember sister Josie's brother Arthur. Sister Charity Walter says she is having surgery Wednesday morning. praying that God guides the surgeon's hands and we can get everything taken care of. We're aiming that we're aiming for as well as a speedy recovery. So, let's ask the Lord to be with Sister Charity and the surgeon as she goes for this procedure. And then, Brother Warren is ministering to the youth at the church in San Jose this morning. Brother James is ministering for brother Lindseay McGrady in North Carolina. And so, let's also remember our pastor, Brother Ron. Brother Mario was there in the Philippines. May the Lord be with them. Brother James, if you would come, if you have a need this morning, you just want to lift it before the Lord with an upraised hand. And &gt;&gt; we serve a God that is more than able. &gt;&gt; We say it time and time again, but it's the truth. Amen. He is more than able. Brother James, if you would come. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I actually have two requests this morning as well that I've forgotten to pin down and I'm glad that uh Brother Mark called on me. Um, one of them is my brother-in-law over in uh my sister sent me a message this morning. My brother-in-law over in Fort Worth, Texas, uh, Daniel Syler. He's going in for a back surgery this week on Tuesday and uh, they've messaged over and asked for the prayer or for the church to pray and I told her that I would and I actually completely forgot to write it down. So, thank the Lord for bringing that to my remembrance this morning. We're grateful for those things, right? She had asked. So, and then another request. I have a young man that works for me at the chemical plant. He works in one of the departments there and his name is Anthony. He sat in my office on Friday and and uh sitting there talking to me about a personal struggle that he's going through. And I just asked him, I said, "What do you want?" And he said, "I just want you to pray." And I said, "You know what? We can do that. &gt;&gt; That we can do. can't fix the problems for you, but we can pray. And so I just said, you know, God honors that faith. And uh so his name is Anthony, and he's going through a very personal thing in his life, very, very difficult struggle. We just ask for prayer for him. So if you wouldn't mind, keep him in prayer as well in the upcoming weeks as he's uh battling with this in his personal life. So as I hold these requests, you know, just reading in my Bible this morning, Proverbs chapter 5, where Solomon was teaching his sons and said, you know, seek for wisdom of God above silver, above gold, we can, you know, if we put as much effort into seeking for the things of God as we do our job and our careers, my what a what a thing we would have, right? &gt;&gt; So anyway, let's bow our hearts before the Lord. Heavenly Father, [Music] as we come before you, as humbly as we know how, Lord, just bringing our petitions. I hold these needs in my hands, Lord. I'm just a man. We're just flesh and blood standing here this morning, but we're redeemed by the blood of the lamb. And Lord, that's what makes the difference. We know this morning as we bring our hearts to you, Lord, that many needs among the body. But Lord Jesus, you are the wonderful almighty God. And Lord, we praise you this morning. We thank you, Lord, for all that you are to us, Lord. all you've done for us, Lord. Even when we maybe wasn't seeking for you, you were continually searching for us. And Lord, we're so thankful &gt;&gt; for that mercy and that grace. And Lord, these petitions, Lord, we know that you have already made a way. Lord, you paid the price already. You finished the work. Help our faith this morning, Lord. Christ to a place where we could reach and accept, Lord, the finished work of Calvary. Lord, be with this service. I pray, Lord, every song that's sung, every voice that's lifted in worship, Lord, may you receive it this morning. Our sacrifice of pray. May we don't feel like it. Maybe we're weak in our body or we're just discouraged, Lord. Encourage the broken heart, Lord. Lord, the the troubled mind. And Lord, I pray that you would just comfort it. Ease, Lord, the thoughts this morning that would beset us. Lord, may we just praise your name regardless. Press past those things this morning. Help us is our prayer. Lord, be with the ministry of the word. Speak to our hearts, Lord. That's what we come here for, Lord, was to seek for more of you, Lord. Help us now. Bless everything in this service. We ask once again each and every person sitting here in your midst in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother James. You may be seated this morning. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. We welcome each one. If you're here visiting, we welcome you. It's good to have brother Larry, Sister Linda Anderson here back with us for the beautiful time of the year. So, it's good to have them here with us. and got an announcement here that church will be holding a lunch following the morning service on November the 2nd in honor of our ministry here. So there's a signup sheet over on the bulletin board in the hallway. So please sign up so we know how much food to plan for. If you have any questions, please contact Sister Linda Laauo. So we're looking forward to that. Amen. It's this weekend is the Canadian Thanksgiving for all my fellow Canadians. I wish you all a happy Canadian Thanksgiving. But we don't have to wait for a holiday to be thankful. I'm so thankful for all that God has done for each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've come this morning to thank him, to worship him. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I have one whose hand I can hold on to. Amen. Jesus, hold my hand. Let's sing that this morning. Amen. As I travel through this pilgrim land, there is a friend who walks with me, leads me safely through the sinking sand is the Christ of Calary. And this would be my prayer, dear Lord, each day. Help me do the best I can. For I need thy light to guide me day and night. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand. Oh Jesus, hold my hand. Oh, I need thee every hour through this pilgrim land. Protect me by thy power and hear my people flee. Oh Lord, look down on me. Heal in prayer. I know I'll meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand and let me travel in the light divine that I may see the blessed way. And keep me that I may be holy thine and sing redemption song someday.

If I a crown of life have won and I have put my truth thee dear Lord reach that golden strand there's no other friend on whom I can depend blessing Jesus hold my hand oh Jesus hold my hand Oh, I need thee every hour through this pilgrim land.

Oh, when the morning comes, when all the saints of God are gathered home, we will tell the story how we've overcome. And we'll understand it better by and by.

Oh, by and by. Oh, when the morning comes, when all the saints of God are gathered home, we will tell the story of how we've overcome. And we'll understand it better by and by.

For we'll understand it better by and by. Oh by and by. When the morning comes, well, God are gathered home. We will tell the story how we've overcome and we'll understand it better.

Thank you for singing for us this morning. Brother Ray, if you'd be ready right after that. [Music] While the world looks upon me as a struggle alone and they say I have nothing. But they are so wrong. In my heart I'm rejoicing. How I wish they could see. Thank you, Lord, for your blessings on me. [Music] There's a roof up above me. Have a good place to sleep.

That's right. &gt;&gt; And I leave it all in his hands. [Music] They are more [Music] exist. Ste [Music] [Music] the way [Music] EM.

Oh, I need you now for your &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; Father, we need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we need you right now, Father. For Lord, we have needs and desires in our hearts that only you can satisfy. Lord, you are the great satisfier. And so, we pray that you would come and satisfy our soul. that you would heal our hearts, heal our minds, touch our lives, Lord. And may we leave this building this morning, Father, knowing your ways and knowing you just a little bit more, Father. May we see patterns within your word. May we see how you do things within your word, Father. Lord, that we may know you better. We love you, Lord. We thank you for all things. We thank you for the opportunity to come and to sit at your feet. We love you. We thank you. We commit all things into thy hands for thy kingdom's glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. It's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you musicians. God bless you richly. Um, as you're turning to the book of John, chapter 3, we'll read verses 16- 18. Um, I have a couple of pictures and stuff here that I would like to show from brother Ron in the Philippines. And, um, it looks kind of small back there. Maybe you can see it there better. So, uh I don't know if any of you heard, but there was a an earthquake in the Philippines and um it was a 7.3 uh multitude. Pretty decent size. And so, the good thing is though for brother Ron, Brother Ron is on the you see where it says Manila, the northern part there, the northern island, not the topest northern part, but the one below it. So that's where brother Ron is is in Manila and the earthquake was on the southern island there of uh Men Mandua I think it's called. And so you know we woke up uh Friday morning and saw there was an earthquake and stuff. We're like oh no you know is brother Ron okay? And so good news brother Ron is okay and uh all the believers are okay also. They haven't heard any news of any fatalities for the believers. So, we just want to thank God for that this morning. And uh we have a few more pictures. &gt;&gt; There's brother Ron in the middle with all the ministers. This is at brother uh Danny Delmundo's church. Brother Ron preached there. I believe it was yesterday. And then he's going to preach this morning also. There they are with all their wives. I think we have a few more. There's brother Danny. What a beautiful pulpit, huh? couple of pictures of the congregation. That's the last one there. So, uh they're getting a lot of rain and um but that's okay. And brother Ron sent a little video to the board chat as well and it sounded like his voice it sounds a lot better. So, you know, um he usually he usually leaves healthy and come home sick. So, maybe he'll leave sick and come home healthy this time. So, I would rather have that, I think. And um so yeah, keep him in prayer. He has a service, you know, Sunday morning and then they have a service Sunday night and then Monday, I believe they have a ministers convention. There'll be 250 ministers there, questions and answers and so forth. So uh he coverets your prayers. Amen. John 3:16, very familiar portion of scripture for us. We'll read 16-18. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned. Thank you, Lord. But he that believeth not is condemned already. because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. Turn with me in your Bibles to the first uh first John. We call it in Ireland small John. 1 John chapter 4. We'll read verses 9 and 10. Hallelujah. God is good. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. Verse N says, "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son to be a propitiation for our sins." Hallelujah. Herein is love. Not that we loved God, but that he first loved us. Amen. You may take your seat this morning. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would like to title my sermon this morning, the love of God. Many books have been written, many songs have been sang, many poems have been written about the love of God. And no doubt people have written these books and sang these songs and poems and whatever it might be through uh an inspiration of how they felt the love of God in their lives. And you know, it's kind of interesting when you begin to think of God and and you begin to think of God's love and you begin to ask the question, you know, how does how does God actually love? How does God pro uh portray his love toward us? And how do we accept his love? Is is his love is it just a is it just a feeling? Is it a warm cozy feeling that uh whenever we're down in the dumps or whenever our heart is broken and and and and and things aren't going uh very well in our lives that we feel uh the outstretched arms of God's love and he comforts us and he and he hugs us and he and he and he warms our heart and and stuff like that. Is it is that all that God's love is? Is it just a a cozy feeling? Is it just an emotion of of of of how God makes us feel on the inside of our hearts? Or what is the real love of God? And if the Bible says that God is love, how does he love his children? And if God is love, does God love everybody? &gt;&gt; It's a good question. Because if God is love and he portrays his love, I want to know how God loves. Because how God loves me, I want to love my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because through the love of God, uh it gives us an example of how we are to love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this morning I I don't want to uh I don't want to preach upon our love towards God but I want to minister on God's love toward us because I believe that it is a subject that is uh misunderstood perhaps and whenever um there's a misunderstanding and we don't understand love we won't understand God and therefore we'll think that God does not love us because we don't understand how he loves. &gt;&gt; So we see that um whenever we think of of God's love and and if you were to ask people well what what is God's love and what does what does it mean for you? No doubt people would say well God's love is an unconditional love which is true. God made an unconditional covenant to Abraham and he said it's not by your works Abraham or it's not by what you're going to do but it's what I have already done for you. And so people will will in in Christianom around the world, they'll take this unconditional love of God and they'll say, "Well, God loves me just how I am." Because God is love. And therefore, no matter how I live my life, whether I'm uh a homosexual or whether I'm a I' I've changed my sex or whatever it may be, God God is love. And so therefore, God loves me for who I am and for how I am. And God knows my heart. I want I don't want to uh lock up your hard drive this morning or and I don't want you to to put the brakes on on me uh at the very start of the service, but I want to make this comment and I want to say just because somebody loves God, it does not mean that God loves that person. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are millions of people in the world today who confess Jesus Christ, who confess with their mouth, and they they read John 3:16 and they read the word where it says, "If you'll believe in thine heart, and if you'll confess the Lord Jesus, uh you'll be saved and that and that God loves you." And people take this scripture and they run with it, but yet they live any kind of life that they want to live and they use the scripture. Well, I've confessed with my mouth and I believe in my heart. Therefore, there's nothing else that I can do. And I love the Lord Jesus Christ. They they make a confession with their mouth. But the Bible says that this people uh they honorth me with their mouth, but yet their hearts are far from me. So therefore, there is a people that love God and it's a sincere love, but yet God does not love them back. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just because somebody confesses to love the Lord, a confession is not a conversion. &gt;&gt; Write it down. &gt;&gt; Confession is not conversion. A confession is a little stone. A a confession is just words out of your mouth. But until the confession becomes a conversion, the love of God is not in that person's heart. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. Brothers, &gt;&gt; we can confess with our mouths all we want. But if our lives is not changed by the supernatural power of Jesus Christ, it is not a conversion. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says he told Peter, "When you're converted, &gt;&gt; Peter preached. He cast out devils. He did many things. He believed in the Lord. But yet Jesus told him, "Whenever you're converted, whenever you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, then feed my sheep." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's many people in Christendom today who are confessing and who who I would say who believe but yet have never been converted. You say, "How do you know that, brother Stephen?" All you got to do is look at the fruits in their lives. &gt;&gt; And so people will take this love of God and they'll say, "Well, if you don't agree with everything and if you don't love everybody, how can you be a Christian?" No. A real Christian will stand upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; No matter what politicians say, no matter what school teachers say, no matter what the neighbors say, the true Christian will stand upon the word of God and the truth of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 7 21- 23. Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven, many will say unto me in that day, many people who have a confession of God. Many people who confess that they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ will come to him in that day. Many people that love the Lord, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They love the Lord. And they'll say, Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works. And then will I profess unto them? I never knew you. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity. I never birthed you. You were never converted. I never had an intimate relationship with you. Yes, you confessed me. You believed, but yet but yet you stopped right there. &gt;&gt; What is the point in having a confession &gt;&gt; and not a conversion? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us sitting here this morning in a message church have a confession of the heart, but yet we've never been converted. I say, Father, move upon the hearts of your people and bring a conversion in our lives. Lord, don't stop there. Give me a refilling of your spirit. &gt;&gt; Matthew 15 7-9. Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, "This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honorth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." People with a confession, people believing onto eternal life, but never fully accepting eternal life by being converted. &gt;&gt; What a place, what a terrible place to be in. That's why brother Brandon would say, "And that day, the bootleger is is not going to be uh uh what's the word? &gt;&gt; Disappointed." Thank you. the the unclean woman on the street is not going to be disappointed, but it's going to be those who have confessed Christianity when they get on that day and they realize they had a confession, but they didn't possess what they were confessing. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be there. in this next uh um sermon here quotes that I would like to read. Um brother Brandham in the previous paragraphs is is talking about his first experience with the Pentecostal people and this is very familiar to us and that's okay. I will just reiterate it into your minds and into your hearts and you can all say amen because you've heard it before. But the Bible says this, "Put them in remembrance of these things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to dwell too long if I if I can help it upon those who love God. And but God doesn't love back. But I I just felt like I wanted to answer that question because because it is something that almost seems unfair because we all know people in our lives, whether it's friends, family, co-workers, or our neighbors, or whoever it is that that confess Christianity, but yet you can see in their lives that there's just something lacking. Just because somebody says they love the Lord, it does not mean that the Lord loves them back. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brham is talking about his first Pentecostal experience and the two men that were prophesying and speaking in tongues. And you all remember that the one was a real genuine Christian and the other one was an absolute hypocrite. The seed of discrepancy, 1965. Two years later, I'd been praying in a cave where I would go to pray. Got dusty in the cave. And one afternoon, I walked out, laid my Bible on a log, and the wind blowed it open to Hebrews the 6th chapter, which said, "In the last days, how it would be if if we fell away from the truth, and renewed ourselves again unto repentance. Uh, there was no more sacrifice for sin, and how the thorns and thistles, which was nigh unto rejection, whose end is to be burned. But the rain cometh upon the earth often to water it to dress it. But the thorns and thistles would be rejected, but the wheat would be gathered. And I thought, well, it was just the wind happened to blow it open. Well, I just laid the Bible down again and I thought, well, here come the wind and blowed it open. That happened three times and I thought, well, now that's strange. You know, sometimes we have to think, uh, this is the third time in a row that this has happened. There's something strange going on here. This is this is the third person that has come to me and given me the same advice without knowing each other. Perhaps God is trying to show me something here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then I raised up and I thought, Lord, why would you open that Bible for me to read when I get down to that where thorns and thistles which is nigh into rejection whose hand is to be burned. I thought, why would you open that to me there? Now, these real visions come without pulling into any gear. That's just God. See? And I looked and I seen an earth that was turning out in front of me. Now, watch what God is doing for his prophet. His prophet, he he's been thinking about this question now for two years. And he gets alone with God and he goes to his cave and he has this question upon upon how can how can how can this be that one man was genuine and the other one was a hypocrite? And so now God takes his prophet and he's giving him a vision to interpret his question, to answer his question. And you're going to see that the interpretation of the vision is actually scriptural because the Lord always stays with his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh there was a man dressed in white went around sewing wheat. And after he went around the curvature of the earth around come a man looked horrible. He was dressed in black and he was throwing weed seeds all over it. They both came up together and when they did they both was thirsty because a rain was needed and each one looked like was praying. Understand the weed was praying and the the wheat was praying. They were both praying for the same thing. One is genuine and one is a hypocrite. And when they did, they were both thirsty because they needed rain and with his and looked like praying with his little head bent over, "Lord, send the rain. Send the rain." And the great clouds come up and the rain fell upon both of them. And when it did, the little wheat jumped up and began to say, "Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord." The little weed jumped up right at the same side and said, "Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord." So you've got the wheat and the weed praising the Lord for answered prayer. &gt;&gt; And then the vision was interpreted. Notice how the vision was t interpreted. It was interpreted by scriptures. &gt;&gt; The rain falls on the just and the unjust. The same spirit can fall in a meeting and everybody rejoice in it. Hypocrites, Christians, and allto together. Exactly right. But what is it? By their fruits they are known. See that's the only way it can ever be known. Then you see that now since wild oats or wild wheat and grain sometimes impersonates a genuine domestic grain. Notice the word impersonates because an impersonator is a hypocrite. So he says, "Sometimes it impersonates a genuine domestic grain so close that it would deceive the very elected." I think we're living in a timely age when these things should be preached on and talked about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're living in a very timely age right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When these things should be preached on and talked about. What things is he talking about that should be preached on and talking about? He's talking about hypocrisy within the church. He's talking about a weed and a weak fellowshipping together, but one is an absolute hypocrite. And how do you know that it's a hypocrite? Because it's living a double life. He says hypocrisy within the church, hypocrisy within the local assembly should be preached on &gt;&gt; and talked about. &gt;&gt; So what is hypocrisy? Hypocrisy is quite simply this. Living a double life. coming to church, putting on your best clothes, putting on your halo, knowing what to say, knowing when to say amen, knowing when to clap your hands at a certain point in a certain song, knowing what to do at the right time, knowing how to fellowship with people outside of outside the church building, but when you get home to live your normal life, the life is different than what you're professing within the assembly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolute hypocrisy. It should be preached on and it should be talked about. &gt;&gt; Hypocrisy within the life of a person who is saying they are a believer but yet their lives by their fruits ye shall know them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're the only one that knows the fruit in your life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're the only one who knows what happens at home when no other believers are around. I want you to understand this concept. You might be able to fool the preacher. You might be able to fool the pastor. You might be able to fool everybody else in church, but there's one person who you're not going to fool, &gt;&gt; and that's God. &gt;&gt; Because God knows our going ins. He knows our going outs. He knows the secret things that we do in private. God knows all things. &gt;&gt; So therefore, I believe that hypocrisy ought to be out of the life of every believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good preaching. &gt;&gt; What's the point in coming to church and being a hypocrite? &gt;&gt; You might as well just be a sinner. &gt;&gt; What's the point? &gt;&gt; And you know why it happens? Because people have just enough of God in them. just enough of a desire to serve them that they want to go to church. They have a confession. That's my confession. That's what I do. But a conversion will change it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hypocrisy. Hypocrisy has been in the church since the first church age. it and and it has rolled and it has snowballed down to where we're at this very last age where sin is we could say is seven times hotter where the furnace is seven times hotter and where sin has just snowballed and compounded so much to where we can't get away from it &gt;&gt; but understand this concept the choice is yours &gt;&gt; the choice is yours you don't have to be a hypocrite No. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to live a double life, &gt;&gt; but you can live a life filled with the love of God, &gt;&gt; serving him to the fullest of your potential. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'll go back to my question. So if God doesn't love all those who love him, then it the question we we we should ask ourselves then who does God love? If he doesn't love everybody that loves him, who does he love? And how does he show his love to the people that he does love? Hallelujah. Love very often is misunderstood when we fail to understand one another. Whether it's in a relationship with a wife or a husband, a spouse, whether it's a relationship between a a a parent and a child or a child and a parent or siblings or just uh friendships amongst each other. When you misunderstand each other and you don't really know the person, it it it gives a a misunderstanding of well, I don't know if they really like me. I don't know if they really love me. I don't know if they're really my friend. Uh I I I don't know. A lot of times when you don't know somebody, uh the first thing you do is, well, I don't like that person. You don't. I had somebody tell me that one time. I don't like that person. I said, really? How much time have you spent with that person? Not very much. Well, how can you cast a judgment upon somebody that you're saying you don't like them when you don't know them? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so a lot of times within our marriages and our our relationships with our children, no matter what the age may be, when we don't understand that person's love toward us, we will think that the person does not love us. When we don't understand a love language and how a person um expresses themselves to the person that they love dearly, when we don't know what their love language is and we don't understand it, all of a sudden we begin to think that person doesn't love me. My spouse doesn't love me. My husband doesn't give me the love that I need. My wife, she doesn't love me. she because uh uh she doesn't do the things that I think she she should do and projecting her love. And kids look to their parents and they say, "Well, mom and dad doesn't love me." It's just because it's not because they don't love them. It's because the person doesn't understand how the person loves. &gt;&gt; And so it is with God. When we misunderstand the love of God, we'll get to thinking in our hearts, God doesn't love me, &gt;&gt; because we'll go through things in life and and and dark places in our life and we'll and we'll begin to think, well, if this is the love of God, God doesn't love me. Why would he let me go through this? Why would this happen? And we begin to question ourselves. and we begin to question God's love for us. &gt;&gt; Whenever we don't understand the and how somebody expresses their love to us and a spouse or whatever it is, when we when we fail to see how they're expressing it, the devil will creep into our minds and into our hearts, honey, will say, "That person doesn't love you. Why do they not love me? And why do we think that? It's just because we don't understand their love language. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Malachi 1:es 2 and 3, it says, "I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, this is amazing. God is telling the the people of Israel here, I have loved you, but yet ye say, wherein hast thou loved us?" Amen. &gt;&gt; God has loved them. He has shown their love towards Israel. &gt;&gt; But because they misunderstand the love of God. &gt;&gt; Their response to God is, "How have you loved us? &gt;&gt; You say you love us. I don't see your love. &gt;&gt; Wherein hast thou loved us?" Was not Esau Jacob's brother, sayeth the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. The peep God here was God that great fountain of love and he had loved Israel but because Israel didn't understand the love of God and how God portrays his love and how God shows his love because they didn't understand it. they thought in their hearts, how do you love us? Do you see the situation that we're in? Have you seen my life? You say you loved us, but how? And no doubt they had a complex in their heart towards God and towards his love for them because they misunderstood how God loves. There's a There's this thing and I'm sure a lot of you are aware of it. And if you've never done it, I think you should do it. And it's called the five love languages. And you should do it with your husband, with your wife, and you should do it with your children because guess what? And I'm and I'm talking I'm not t talking just little kids. I'm talking you people that are grandparents. You need to understand how your children and how your grandchildren love. So there's this quiz that you can take online and uh and it's worth doing every couple of years. And the reason being is this is because your love language changes with time. So it's this little quiz. You can just Google five love languages quiz, right? go on there, take the quiz, and it'll you'll answer these questions and and it'll spit out the answer of your top three love languages or your top two love languages. Okay? And me and me and Ashlin, we did it when we first got married. And um and it just it was just very interesting because it's good to know how your spouse loves because when they're showing you their love and you don't know that that's how they love and how they're showing their appreciation and love towards you and you miss it and you give way to Satan, all of a sudden the spouse is going to think that person he or she should be loving me this way because this is how I receive love. But yet their love language is different than yours. And so they're giving something and you're not receiving it. And all of a sudden you think in your heart, my goodness, we're falling out of love. We don't love each other anymore. No, you just don't understand each other well enough. So, when we first got married, um Ashlin's I forget what hers was, but I remember one of them. I think her top one was gift giving was gifts. I'll let me tell you the five words of affirmation, quality time, gifts, giving and receiving, physical touch, and acts of service. So, her top one was gifts. So, giving gifts and receiving gifts. And so, you know, whenever you think of a giftgiver, a giftgiver also likes to receive gifts. And it took me years to figure out that it doesn't have to be something expensive. All it has to be is a little something that says, "I was thinking about you. I saw this and this reminded me of you. Therefore, I bought this from the dollar store just for you. You guys are like, "You're cheap. It's still a gift." &gt;&gt; The gift is not what is in question here. It's the heart behind it. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, I I do this a lot. And so I just, you know, it's okay because it keeps me real and it keeps me grounded. I would go and say I'm getting home early or something and there's a Dutch Bros on the way home, I'll stop and get myself a Dutch Bros. myself and I get home and I'll drink it. Yeah, that went down really well. I'll share it with you, honey. until and it took me years. Literally, I'm a little slow, but I catch on quick. Took me a while to figure out. It's not that she wants coffee. It's just that she likes to know that, hey, you were thinking about me when you went for coffee, and you got me my favorite sugar-free coffee. So, I stepped it up one time and I had the barista write I love you on it. Extra brownie point. It's not the size of the gift. And and so me personally, okay, I'm not a giftgiver. Like I just I just didn't think about that stuff, you know, only child, think about yourself most of the time, okay? And so I just didn't think about it. So sometimes Ashlin would come home from doing the groceries and there she would buy me my favorite candy bar, Kinder Buenos. They're so good. Yeah, they're so good. They're my favorite. So she would bring it home and it says caramel and it's got all this stuff in it and and they only started making them, you know, selling them here this past few years. The only place you could really get them was like World Market or something. is like an Irish candy. Go figure. Go bueno. And uh and so she would come home and I would have that little candy bar. Oh, that that's nice. Thank you. You know, and just eat it without realizing. She saw the candy bar and she thought of me because that is her way of of of showing and projecting her love to me was through the the the love of giving and the giving of gifts. And it took me a while to realize that this is her love language. Even though I knew it was was gifts, it took a while for the penny to really drop. Then I realized this is how she is showing her love towards me and showing me that while she was out doing the shopping, she was thinking of me. That was her love language. And so the years go on. We've been married 13 years thereabouts. And so the years go on and we're like, you know what? We should do this again. Let's do the love language test again. Well, lo and behold, it changed. You got four, five, six kids later, you take the test, it's no longer giftgiving. Yet, it's still there. But now her love language is quality time. Why is it quality time? Yeah. Six kids later, you don't have a lot of quality time, brother. And so, if I'm still trying to serve and love her through the giving of gifts, yet it's still nice, but it changes through time. And so now I need to make sure that I set aside some time. And you better believe it. We're going on a date tonight. That we set aside some quality time one with another. Why? So she so that I can make sure that she knows that I love her. That I'm that I'm that I'm doing my part to spend quality time with her because that is what she needs. at this time in our marriage. Now, if I if if if if uh words of affirmation is one, words of affirmation was was at the very beginning one of my love languages. And so, if I'm trying to love her with words of affirmation, but yet it's not her love language, but it's mine. It's not received as love unless she knows it's my love language. Physical touch, a hug, whatever it may be. That's one of my uh that's one of the love languages, you know, Henry, my my son, like just started kindergarten, right? And uh and the teacher, so they do the written reports, all this stuff. Yeah. And she says, "I love my my many daily hugs from Henry." Like, Henry, one hug in the morning, one hug after church, after school. That's enough. Okay? You don't always have to be hugging the teacher. But guess what it is? &gt;&gt; It's his love language, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He loves to hug. He loves to cuddle. and Ashlin and she she brought it to my attention and she said don't take away his love language because that's how he's expressing his love toward his teacher and his gratefulness and his thankfulness cuz she's such a good teacher physical touch. And so now I need to make sure give me a hug son because I know that's that's his language and I need to speak his language and I need to understand his language and he needs to know that I understand his language and I don't love him with my language but I love back with his own language. That way he doesn't misunderstand and say dad doesn't love me cuz he never wants to give me a hug. But when I embrace him and I wait until he's done with the hug and I don't let go of the hug first, he knows, he understands because that's his language, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is physical touch. So we need to understand one another. We need to understand your spouse's love language because if you don't understand it and if their love language has changed, you're going to misunderstand and all of a sudden you're going to be like Israel looking at God and looking at your husband, looking at your wife and saying, "You don't love me anymore. Why don't you love me?" The kids will look at mom and dad and say, "You don't love me. You don't treat me with love." Yet, they are. They're just doing it in a different way. And when you misunderstand it, that's when Satan can creep into our hearts, into our minds, and affect our lives. &gt;&gt; And if they don't know what yours is, you know, it doesn't have to be this great secret. Well, I'm just going to let them figure it out. Nonsense. &gt;&gt; This is my love language towards you. This is how I love you. When I do this, I am showing that I love you. That way they know. Every time you show your affirmation or your love for your loved one, guess what? They receive it because they understand you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, how does God love us? We've talked about spouses and we've talked about children and so on and so forth. But but who does God love and how does God show his love towards those who he loves? The scripture has the answer. I am so thankful for a prophet of God in this hour and in this day because now we don't have to wonder how does God love and who does he love because the answer is in the message. &gt;&gt; You don't have to look very far to find the answer. An exposition of the seven church ages. Uh this is the Leodysian church age book. Brother Brandham says, "Let us examine the first phrase, as many as I love." You can find that in Revelation 3:9. That's to this church age. As many as I love. So, he's he's going to start telling us there's many of people that I love. And he's going to start explaining to us how God loves the many. Not everybody, but how God loves the many. In the Greek, the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun I. He does not say as many would feel. He should say as many as love me. No sir, we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse. No, it is the many that are the loved ones of God. It is his love in question, not ours. So it's not to everybody. It doesn't say I love everybody therefore I do this. But he's saying to the many that I love. And I believe I'm looking at the many here this morning who is a part of that scripture. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; So once again we find ourselves glorying in his in his salvation, his purpose and his plan. And we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignity of God. Even as he said in Romans 9:13, "Jacob have I loved, does it now obtain that since he loved only the many, is he therefore in a state of complacency, awaiting the love of those who have not drawn nigh to him? By no means is this so, for he declared also in Romans 13, Esau have I hated." So now he's he's making a differentiation between Esau and Jacob who were twins. And in every revival and in every move of God, there's twins. In every revival, &gt;&gt; there's an Esau and there's a Jacob. There's a spiritual and there's a carnal. There's one that's loved and there's one that hated. And in verse 11, the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born, neither having done either good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand. Understand? God has a purpose to those who are called by election. &gt;&gt; God has a purpose for your life. Why? Because he has elected you since before the foundations of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, let me share this before I move on. We had a youth meeting on Friday night and we spoke on redeeming the time. Understand you have an allotted time upon this earth. &gt;&gt; What are you doing with the allotted time that God has given you upon this earth? What purpose the purpose that God has given you while you are here for how however many years it may be. How are you redeeming the time for the Lord? Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; He says that the purpose of God uh according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth. This love is elective love. So now he's beginning to share with us who he loves. And we're beginning to find out that God's love is an elective love. In other words, he chooses who he'll love. and he chooses who he won't love. So love, election, and predestination are all connected together one with another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He only loves those who are predestinated by the election of God from before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; So does God love everybody? No, he doesn't. Who does he love? He loves the elected lady. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is elective love. It is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from human merit. For it says that the purpose of God stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself. Because before the children were born, he had already said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." Hallelujah. that makes us feel really good. Especially when you're on the right side of the coin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got a bunch of scriptures here because I just want to clinch the nail. I I want to hammer it in and I want to clinch it on the election of God. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 31:3, "The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, "Yay, I have loved thee with an everlasting love. Therefore, with loving kindness have I drawn thee." So he loved the children of Israel by appearing onto them. He loved them with an everlasting love. Therefore, by his loving kindness have I drawn thee. Drawn thee is something that we need to pay attention to because God's love is elective and God's love will draw you into his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:4 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundations of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Romans 11:5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 1 Thessalonians 1:es 2-4. We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers, remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love, patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our father, knowing brethren, beloved, your election of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 5:13, "The church that is of Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you, and so doth Marcus, my son." Are you are you seeing the continuity of the scriptures here that there is a people that is elected and loved of God? And how does he how do we know that we are loved of God? Because he has elected us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 24 22- 24. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved. But for the elect's sake, those days shall be shortened. And if any man shall say unto you, lo, here is Christ, or there believe it not. For there shall arise false Christ, false prophets, and show great signs and wonders, and so much that if it were possible, they shall dise. Romans 8:23, who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies. See, God's election is throughout the entire Bible, the Old Testament and the New Testament. Well, you say, "Well, it's not fair. Who are we to tell God who he can love and who he cannot love?" &gt;&gt; Matthew 13:es 10-11. And the disciples came and said unto him, "Why speakest thou unto them in parables?" Notice who was who are they talking about? They're talking about the people outside of the light. Talking about the the the Pharisees and the Sadducees and and the people around. Why do you talk to them in parables? He answered and said unto them, "Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given &gt;&gt; to them the love of God is not shown." Why? Because they weren't elected according to Jacob. &gt;&gt; Matthew 11 25 and 26. At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee, oh Father of heaven and earth, because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent, has revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." Who is it that opens the blinded eyes to the word of the day? It is God. And why does God do it? Because his election is showing forth his love. And what does he do to those who he loves? He reveals himself. He appears to them and he reveals himself who he is in the hour in which they're living in. That's the love of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For it seemed good in thy sight. It's good in the sight of the father to reveal to you his words. It's good in the sight of the father to reveal to his elect lady the light of the scripture and the hour in which we're living in. &gt;&gt; After his resurrection, Jesus only revealed himself and made himself known to his elected lady. And he's doing the exact same thing in this day and in this hour in which we're living in. Because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does he love everybody? No. How does he show forth his love? First of all, it's an elective love. How do I know if I've been elected by God? When God opens the understanding and enlightens your eyes with the Isel of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and he opens his word to you and he makes himself known onto you and he appears onto you through the spoken word of this day is the very love of God projected to you today. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Brother Bradom said that Jesus was the projection the how God projected his love to the world. Not just by sending Jesus to the world but by opening the understanding of the disciples eyes of who Jesus really was. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you. But my father who is in heaven has revealed this onto you. He has opened your eyes, the eyes of your understanding. He has given you a a heart to receive. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's no different in this day. The appearing that we've had in this hour, the appearing is one thing cuz many saw the appearing of the son of man, but they didn't understand it. It's one thing to see the appearing, but it's another thing to understand the mystery behind the appearing. Right? &gt;&gt; What good is it to under to see and the appearing and to see the great signs and wonders if you don't catch the mystery behind what's hidden behind flesh. The mystery that's hidden behind the appearing. &gt;&gt; It's pointless. It's actually judgment &gt;&gt; because you see his appearing but you you miss the mystery behind the appearing. So to one it is to one it is it is salvation &gt;&gt; but to another it's rejection to one it's salvation to another one it is rejection to one it is life. But to reject life is death. God shows his love by appearing and through this appearing revealing himself to his elected. Not only does he appear but he reveals the mystery behind the appearing the pillar of fire in the cloud in the Old Testament. It was it was a sign to Israel that God was with them. that God was leading them through uh from Egypt through the wilderness, that God was with them, that God was taking care of them. They had a a cloud by day and a and a pillar of fire by night. And and they were they were not only symbols, but it was it was God himself that was dwelling in the fire. It was God himself who was dwelling in the cloud. and he himself was leading his people through a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; So it wasn't just a pillar or a fire and it wasn't just a cloud, but it was actually God himself. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire returned to the earth to lead God's people at Pentecost. Here was this clove and tongues of fire and it and it and it and it and it hovered over the people and and and Peter once this full conversion had taken place. My goodness, you talk about the power and you talk about demonstration of the word indeed not just in word but in but in demonstration. And so here was this God Jesus Christ who was the logos and came down from God dwelt in a body. Now he went back to this pillar of fire again. It was the same the same pillar of fire that was leading the children of Israel from Egypt to the promised land. &gt;&gt; And so now here's Paul and he's thinking he's doing a really good thing. He's he's going after the believers and he's and he's doing this and he's throwing this one in jail and he's holding the coat of those who stoned Stephen and he thinks I'm going to get rid of these heresies and I'm going to get rid of these guys cuz how dare they come up against the Sanhedrin and so on and so forth. All of a sudden there's a light pillar of fire in the sky &gt;&gt; and it blinds his eyes. He says, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" He says, "Lord, who are you? &gt;&gt; Tell me your name. &gt;&gt; I know this pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; I know it's you, Lord. I know it's Adoni. I know it's Elohim." Whatever name you want to give him, I know it's you. What is your name? He says, "I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; I am Jesus." You see, Jehovah of the Old Testament became Jesus of the New Testament. So now all of a sudden this this this this pillar of fire now which which was once once led Israel in the Old Testament is now in the New Testament church. And what's the purpose of it? The same as it was from Egypt to the promise to lead his people. &gt;&gt; What is the pillar of fire for? What is the Holy Ghost for? Let me say this. It's more than a sensation. It's more than a feeling. But it's the divine. He is the divine revealer of the word. &gt;&gt; And without the divine revealer of the holy word of the word within our hearts, there's no way to understand the word. That's why a confession isn't good enough. But a complete conversion. So now we see that the pillar of fire returned back then but there was never no mention of the cloud. &gt;&gt; Where did the cloud go? If we are to be led by a pillar of fire and a cloud just like because brother Brandham preaches Israel in the church and he makes the parallel between Israel and us. how they came out of Egypt, how we come out of the world, how we're we're we're we're on a journey to a promised land that has been promised to the the the the the seed of the faith seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; We're on a journey. We've seen the pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; but where's the cloud? &gt;&gt; Where's the cloud been through seven church ages? Where was the cloud with Martin Luther? Where was it with with John Wesley? Where where was it? If we're to be led by a a cloud and and by the pillar of fire, where is the cloud? It's been returned to us. God waited throughout seven church ages. And at the very end of the seventh church age, now he says, "I am going to unite the pillar and cloud once again." Why is he doing it? He's doing it to lead his people. So, here's brother Brandham and and you all know the story and he's he's he's wondering what this all means and he doesn't understand it. I want to tell you it's more than just a cloud. &gt;&gt; It is more than just a picture. It is more than just angels with a revelation. But it's the very mind and presence of God back upon the earth again for what purpose? To lead his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. The purpose of the cloud and the fire is is to lead his people to the promised land. &gt;&gt; Therefore, everything that was contained within this cloud is needful for you and I in this day in which we're living in. Because without the cloud, without the very mind of God being revealed to us, &gt;&gt; we don't have the perfect leadership of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "All we need, brother, is the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; We just need the Holy Ghost and it'll teach you all things. Not true. You need a prophet. &gt;&gt; You need a prophet with the mind of God who's going to teach you these things, who's going to show you how to live your life, who's going to reveal to you the mysteries that have been hidden within this book, that we may know how to get ready for a rapture. Why do we need the cloud? And why is it so important? Because it is God's headship and leadership guiding the church to their promised land. &gt;&gt; So we should never say one to another that it's not important. We should never say one to another that it's not needed. We should never say one to another. It's just a story or it's just a picture. &gt;&gt; It is God's leadership for his chosen elected lady. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, did you know that a pastor couldn't preach the seven seals with the revelation of it? Teacher couldn't have done it. An evangelist couldn't have done it. &gt;&gt; It had to be a prophet &gt;&gt; because the word of the Lord comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; And so, let me say this that as a minister of the gospel, I have nothing more to add to the revelation that has already been given by that prophet messenger. I will gain more revelation as we walk in the light, but I will not add any more revelation to it because nothing can be added to it and nothing should be taken away from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice this. Revelations 10:7. But in the vo in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets. God was a mystery until the sounding forth of this seventh church age messenger. But because the book has become opened by the loosing or the breaking of these seals, God and his complete plan of redemption is no more a mystery. But now we understand the plan of redemption that God has given us in this day and in this hour. &gt;&gt; God is no longer a mystery. We should be able to understand God. Why? Because the book has become open. &gt;&gt; The mysteries have become unfolded. &gt;&gt; There is no longer a mystery between the bride &gt;&gt; and God. &gt;&gt; The mystery is this now is Christ in you, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; The mystery was once held within a book. And the book was sealed. But now the book is open &gt;&gt; and now the mysteries have unfolded. But let me ask you a question. What is a book? A book is quite simply a collection of words. It's a collection of word. So now where is the mystery? &gt;&gt; The mystery lays within the word. &gt;&gt; The book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Within this book, there was seven thunders. And the seven thunders, they had a voice. And John heard these thunders. He heard the voice. And he was he was about to write what they were saying because John understood what the voice was saying. He understood what the thunders were. And when he was beginning to write what these mysteries were that were hidden underneath these seals, these seven thunders, the voice told him and said, "Hey, John, write it not. &gt;&gt; I know you understand it." You see, the understanding is for the bride. &gt;&gt; I know you understand it. I know you heard it, but this can't be something that is written. This is a hidden uh uh this is a hidden mystery that has to be revealed by me personally. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said those seven thunders are being manifested that's not even written within the scripture. &gt;&gt; He was forbidden to write it. But though it wasn't written, the mystery is there. &gt;&gt; And so now the mystery is divinely given by God himself. Yeah, &gt;&gt; if it's not written, how how can you try to figure it out with a carnal mind? &gt;&gt; You can't do it. That's why it's a divinely revealed truth. &gt;&gt; Once these seals were loosed, it loosed these thundering voices that wasn't even permitted to be written. The seals had the thunders closed up. It had them covered. It had them sealed. These the the mysteries of these thunders were sealed up by these seven seals. But when they were broken and the word became a new book and it became an open book, what what made it a new book? It was the revelation of the thunders. That's what made it a new book. And so that's why revelation is personally given to us by God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 1-4. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow above his upon his head. And his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot on the sea and his left upon the earth. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. They said something. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voice, I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not." Understand it wasn't to be given for everybody, &gt;&gt; but it is given to the elect of God. &gt;&gt; Questions and answers 1964. This is a question. Have the seven thunders which equal seven mysteries already been revealed. Were they revealed in the seven seals, but are yet not known to us as the thunders yet? No, they were revealed in the seven seals. That's what the thunders was about. The seven thunders that had uttered their voices, and no one could make out what it was. John knew what it was, but he was forbidden to write it. But the seventh angel in the days of his sounding, the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed. And the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh church age sea. So what is he he's he's telling the people that it's not something that you have to wait for, but it's something that is already being revealed. Say, "Brother Stephen, why are you sharing this?" Because this is the love of God. &gt;&gt; It's the love of God to you personally when he opens the book to you and he reveals to you those mysterious thunders that were hidden um underneath those seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hidden for seven church ages. Now these last times have been revealed to you and I, his elect lady. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You talk about love. &gt;&gt; So how do we how do we understand God's love toward us? &gt;&gt; Because remember, if you don't understand God's love, you're going to think he doesn't love you. So, how do we know that God loves us? It's because he has opened our eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he has given us an understanding of the truth in this day of things that were once mysterious, &gt;&gt; but now are being plainly made known under the loosening of the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; What love. that he kept it for all this time &gt;&gt; and he kept you all this time in the back part of his mind until it was the time for you to come forth and to manifest his word. And how can you manifest his word if it's not revealed to you? Amen. &gt;&gt; So what God does is he says I want you at this end time in Leodysia to be in this church age at this specific time because I have a purpose of you because of election and predestination. And I want you to live a life that is manifesting these seven mysterious thunders will not understand but you will understand it. &gt;&gt; The love of God. You see, he wants you to manifest something. Therefore, God makes a way for you to manifest it. &gt;&gt; That's what love is. &gt;&gt; God does not expect us to manifest something without making a way for us to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it is. We can't expect something from one another, from our children, from our family members, as the heads of the house, if we don't make a way for it to happen. &gt;&gt; That's love. How can you expect your children to mow the lawn if you never teach them? &gt;&gt; You expect them to do something, they don't do it right, and they get corrected. &gt;&gt; Is that good or evil? &gt;&gt; It's evil. &gt;&gt; Why is it evil? Because you wanted something to happen, but you didn't make a way for it to happen. &gt;&gt; It's called setting him up to fail. in the Leodysian church age talking about God's love. And I'm I'm going to wind down here. Stick with me. And now he says to his own, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen." Notice his love. And you all know this. His love is to rebuke and it's to chasen. The love of God. Don't misunderstand God's love. His love is to rebuke and his love is to chasen and his love is to reveal to his elected lady. So if God has revealed the word for this day to you in your heart, it's a certain fact that God is showing to you that he loves you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To rebuke is to reprove. To reprove is to expose with the with a view of correction. Chasen does not mean to punish. It means to discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind. &gt;&gt; This one really that that part of the quote that really stood out to me because you all know we are in the corrective years of of of life with children. Chasing does not mean to punish. I wonder how many times you and I have corrected and we have chasened our children for punishment. Punishment, you know, punishment is something that that you do to a criminal. You know what happens to criminals when they're in jail, in prison or or stuff like that? They get hardened. &gt;&gt; Their hearts get hardened. Their spirits get hardened. They get hatred in their life. They get animosity. They get all these different things. Why? Because they're being they're being punished. And and the punishment, you know, the jails and everything, they think, well, if we just punish them enough, you know, they'll get right. It's not true. A lot of people go to jail punished and they come out worse. &gt;&gt; It hardens a heart. It hardens a life. It it it it makes a a heart stony. and in their mind they're thinking, "I'm being punished for this." Do you like anybody that punishes you? Do you like a ministry that you ever have you ever heard a sermon or a ministry that punishes the people for doing wrong? &gt;&gt; I'm going to punish you. And because thou didest this, you are punished from this time forth. God help us. The purpose of chastening is not for punishment in the eyes of God, &gt;&gt; but the discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind. So in other words, God has uh uh an end result that he's trying to bring us to. He has he has a start here and we go through this journey of life, but he's really wanting to bring us over here. And and the reason for the chastening and the reason for the correction along the journey is because he wants us to have the right kind of character when it comes time over here that we would receive a body change cuz the only thing that we're going to take with us is our character. So God has an end an end view in mind for you and I. And the chastening is not for punishment. It's not because he hates you. It's not it's not anything like that. It's because it's his love that he has an end plan for you to get to make it over here. &gt;&gt; So now as fathers and as mothers, we should take this same chastening and we oughten to be chasening our kids and our children for punishment's sake &gt;&gt; because it's for punishment. It's going to be taken the wrong way. &gt;&gt; It's going to be taken. is going to give a hardened neck, a hardened heart. They're going to think you don't love them. So on and so forth. Why? Because there's a difference in punishment. And I'm doing this to teach you a lesson because I want you to come out on the other side as a good, moral human being filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's not for punishment. &gt;&gt; And so we shouldn't punish one another. &gt;&gt; It's amazing, isn't it? This is exactly what we find in Hebrews 12:5-11. And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speakest unto you as unto children. My son despise thou not despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth, he chastineth. Look at that. Who he loves, he chastens and chastens and scorgth. Every son who whom he receiveth. If he if he endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons. For what son is he whom the father chastens not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then your bastards, and not sons. Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence. Shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live? For they verily for a few days chasened us after their own pleasure, but he for our profit. So why does God chasen us and rebuke us? It's for our profit. It's for our good. It's actually the love of God towards you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't understand, misunderstand the love of God. &gt;&gt; When you receive chastening and rebuking and so on and so forth. It is the very love of God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, no chastening for the present seemth to be joyous but grievious. Nevertheless, afterward it yieldth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. Herein is now set forth the love of God. Everybody listen. He desired in love a family of his own, a family of sons, sons like himself, sons and daughters. There before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay. Out of that lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor. The choosing will be his own choosing. Then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to his image and their walk. &gt;&gt; So what is God expecting from us from all of the things that we go through that we would be conformed in our walk with him? &gt;&gt; It's all about our daily lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He repro reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy. He chasens with nail scarred hands. Sometimes his potter must take the vessel he's working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it. But it is love. That is his love. Another way of his love there is not there cannot be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; as the musicians would come we'll bring this to a close. So let's summarize our sermon and let's ask ourselves what is the love of God. First off the love of God is elective love. He takes a whole lump and out of that lump he chooses Esau's and he chooses Jacob's. He chooses vessels onto honor. He chooses vessels onto dishonor. And this choosing is his own choosing. And it is it is his way of showing his love towards you who are elected. And not only does he elect those people, but now he appears onto them and he reveals himself as a mystery under the appearing. Because there's many people that see the appearing and they see the signs and they see the wonders, but they miss the mystery of God underneath the appearing. But his love to his elect, what does he do? He reveals it to you. &gt;&gt; Why has God revealed himself to you in this day? I'll tell you why. because there is a scripture that must be fulfilled. That in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, your bodies shall be changed. That there would be a shout, there'd be a voice, there'd be the trump of God, and these things would all happen as he was descending. But there would be a people upon earth that would recognize this appearing, that would recognize this coming. And underneath that mystery now, they would begin to prepare their lives according to the word that came out of the cloud that's leading the people to the promised land. According to that word, now the people would live a life. They would walk through tragedies. They would walk through uh things that were not pleasant. They would walk through rebukings and chastisements from God. But they would come to a certain place where a scripture would be fulfilled. That somebody would not taste of death, but they would go to meet the Lord in the air. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That this vessel of impurity would take on purity. That this earthly tabernacle would put on a a glorious and a heavenly tabernacle. These are scriptures that are going to be fulfilled by somebody. And it's going to be fulfilled by the elect of God in this hour. &gt;&gt; Understand, we are not looking for more signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Those signs follow the believers. We believe that. But we're not looking for someone to rise up with a great ministry and great signs and great wonders. We are not looking for brother Brandham to return and to fulfill his ministry. His ministry has already been fulfilled. And let me say this, it was fulfilled perfectly. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham turned his back to the people, &gt;&gt; Gentile people. He said, "You're receiving your last sign. &gt;&gt; There's no more signs that are to be given to the Gentiles." The last The last thing that is to happen, the last thing that we're looking for and watching for is the coming of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's coming a day &gt;&gt; when the body of Jesus Christ that lays upon the altar of sacrifice right now as we speak. There's coming a day where that body is going to come and he's going to step off the altar of sacrifice. And he's going to come to earth and he's going to come and he's going to receive a people. He's going to step forth to claim those who he has redeemed and purchased by his blood. &gt;&gt; He steps forth. Where's my claim? I'm watching. I'm waiting, Lord. I'm I'm following your leadership by the pillar of fire in my heart and by this cloud that you've given us to lead us in the truth of your word. Where is my claim that I have redeemed with a price? &gt;&gt; I'm right here. &gt;&gt; I'm watching. I'm waiting. I'm under anticipation. I'm not looking for anything else. I'm not looking for signs. I'm not looking for wonders. I'm looking for him to come and to claim me as my own. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You remember as it comes to me, you remember uh the the the the story that brother Brandham tells of the little dishwasher woman and he talks of her. She and and and and she her parents died. It almost sounds like Cinderella, the story that he tells. and and one of the people that owned the ranch or whatever, one of the sons was was coming and looking for a wife and and all of the girls of the city, they were all, "Oh, it's going to be me and it's going to be me." And they're all getting all dressed up and and here's this little it's a cousin. I'll call her a little washer woman. She would wash the clothes and clean the floor and do all these things. She didn't have nice clothes. She wasn't She didn't have the the the pretty hair and the pretty necklaces and all these things. No, she didn't have an outward beauty like that, but she had a character. She had a beauty within her, a certain character and beauty that this man was looking for. So, while everybody else was flirting with him and and and trying to get his attention, here she was busy working and he waits for her outside and she walks out and she sees him and she's embarrassed. Look at me, man. I'm all dirty and raggedy and no doubt her hair her bun was messy and she was cleaning. But he saw something in her that nobody else saw. And he said, "You know, I've come here to look for a wife and so on and so forth." They converse and he says, "Will you marry me? Me? Marry you? Look at me." You ever looked at yourself in the presence of God? &gt;&gt; Look at me, man. I'm so dirty. Got these raggedy clothes on. My hair don't look nice. I How can he love me? He's not coming for beauty of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he started your journey here and he chasens and he rebukes you along here with his tender hand and love and he reveals himself to you and all of a sudden you come out here on this other side and and you still look raggedy. Your flesh man is always going to look raggedy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is always going to look unclean. It's always always going to look like a dishwasher boy or a dishwasher girl when you compare yourself to the world. But he's not looking at that. He's looking at the character that was forged through the fire of tribulations. And all of a sudden, you come here and you're like, "Wow, you want to marry me?" &gt;&gt; You hear his message. You hear his word. And you accept it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Yes, &gt;&gt; I'll marry you. &gt;&gt; I'll be yours if you'll take me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How I am, &gt;&gt; but I promise I won't stay as I am. But I'll walk in your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I'll change and I'll listen to your voice and I'll listen to your message and I'll prepare myself. And he says, "A year from today, I'm going to come back and I'm going to get you." &gt;&gt; So for a year, she plans and she gets ready and she's dressing herself every day &gt;&gt; in the word. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; She heard his voice. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; She &gt;&gt; she saw and she understood the mystery underneath the thunders that the reason for it is quite simply this to prepare a people &gt;&gt; for a prepared place. And she recognized it. She understood it. She had a revelation of it. And it didn't matter what anybody else said or done and teased her about what she believed or the voice that she heard or the understanding that she has. She said, "I'm going to prepare because he's coming back for me because he promised me." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; My We put oursel in her shoes and we think, "Lord, here I am." &gt;&gt; You know, I need your help. I need your wisdom and I need your guidance and I need that inner voice, the Holy Ghost to reveal to me &gt;&gt; the mystery of how I should live my life that Lord, when you step forth from the altar of sacrifice and you come to claim me, the purchased, the redeemed, the purchased of your blood, I'll be right here &gt;&gt; and I'll be watching y &gt;&gt; and I'll be ready, Lord. Lord, how many of you say, "I'm watching and I'm waiting." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't looking for something spectacular, an everyday simple life, living for Christ Jesus, applying the word to my life. I know that whenever he steps forth, I'll be watching. I'll be waiting and I'll be ready. And if I'm ready, I know that I'll meet him in the air. Why? Because he promised it to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And so all of a sudden the bride goes up representation of the blood and all hell breaks loose on earth. I'm so thankful &gt;&gt; for the promise of God in this day. &gt;&gt; A promise that he is taking my heart back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers. that the alpha now is meeting the omega now is meeting the alpha and they are becoming one and then when he comes we shall we shall know him for we shall be like him and we shall be as he is. Amen. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Your love is life to me. My truest longing mighty deepest without you. One moment I don't know where I'd be. Cuz your love is life to me. Your love is life to me. My trueest longing, my deepest need. Without you one moment, I don't know where I'd be. Your love is life. Sing it again. Your love is life to me. My trueest longing my deepest me.
