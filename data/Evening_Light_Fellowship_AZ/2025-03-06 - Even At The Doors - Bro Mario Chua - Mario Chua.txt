will not hold you too long and I will not uh so it's depend on how you pull there you go amen amen amen so I will just be depending upon you don't depend upon me but I will be depending upon you amen cuz I only have a short sermon tonight but it's up to you amen amen so the prophet always said that we get what we expect amen amen if we expect to be blessed I'm sure you will get it amen thank you Lord and I believe that we are blessed tonight even amen if we don't start the sermon yet we are already blessed because the scripture said that uh blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness and you shall be filled amen so we don't come here to see a man we come here to be filled amen and God put hunger and thirst in your heart so that will be a blessing because we are now living in loudan age which is the lukor age and some are sway by the laress but we are here hungering thirsting to hear from the word of God Amen so help me out so we'll turn to Matthew chapter 24 verse 32 and 39 thank you sister Irma for a beautiful song offering tonight so we are hiding in the rock of the revelation of the word of God praise the Lord so in the Book of Matthew uh verse 32 says now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and put it forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled amen Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away amen but of that day and hour knoweth no man know not angels of heaven but my fathers only amen but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be and may the Lord had a blessing upon the reading of this word you may be seated amen and you know Matthew chapter 24 is uh the opening of The Seven Seals in verb and in Prophecy form Matthew 24 and Jesus unfold the seven seal in Prophecy form as he answered the two questions of the disciples so I will not read all the Matthew Matthew 24 but it will give you a hint to just study it when you go home Matthew 24 praise God Amen he unfold the seven seal in Prophecy form as he answered the two questions of the disciples and he end it with as it was in the days of Noah which is the mystery of the seven SE the mystery of his coming showing that his second coming would not be the revealing of his Corporal body but by the revealing of the word amen as Matthew chapter 27 said for us the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be and we know the light is the revealing of the word into the hearts of the people amen a prophetic worldwide Revelation in the end time from the East unto the West so when the brother Bram preached about the Seven Seals as God unfold the revelation of the Seven Seals in chapter 6 through 8 of Revelation he always tie up Matthew chapter 24 so Matthew 24 is the Seven Seals in word and prophetic form but Revelation chap 6 and 8 is in symbol form and I believe that we are already at the end everything is already being unfolded in our generation that's right from the rising of the Antichrist from the the rising of the false prophet amen for Wars and humors of Wars the tribulations and the calamities that we are seeing all around us is just the Fulfillment of what is being opened in our day amen but that will not be my topic for tonight because I will focus on chapter 32 but I would like you to I once again to encourage you to read Matthew 24 and the Book of Revelation the six seal or the seven seal so it will encourage us that the things that we see around us is just the fulfill of scripture being unfolded in our generation so we are the Blessed people because the thing that was hidden from the foundation of the word is now being revealed Among Us Praise the Lord so this in verse 32 now learn the parable of the fig trees and we know that fig Tre represent the the nations of Israel and when his Bron is set Thunder and put it forth leaves ye know that summer is night and we know that when Israel became a nation in 1948 that is also around the time when the voice of the seventh angel the prophetic Ministry of the seventh angel began in its infancy the first pool and the second pool amen so what happened to the the nation of Israel is by by by Nation but to the Gentile is an individual Affair amen so likewise ye when you shall see all these things so brother uh the Lord Jesus Christ is already unfolding what is happening the rise of the Antichrist the false prophet the calamities Wars and humors of Wars all of this and he said so likewise when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors so the praise even at the door which is the title of my sermon tonight means a rapid closing of the time so it's not about end of the world but it's about the end time and we have arve at the end time we see all the sign around us and we have arrived and he said that even at the door a praise means a rapid closing of the time and even the bulletin of atomic scientist they have a PRI release which we call the Doomsday a symbol clock adopted by atomic scientist to to show how close human beings are considered to be a global catastrophic with midnight standing for annelation or Doomsday even the science know it that's right Washington DC in January 28 2025 the Doomsday Clock Was set at 89 second to midnight the closest clock has ever been to midnight in its 78 years years history so we have arrived amen praise the Lord the 2025 clock time signal that the word is on a course of unprecedented risks and that continuing on the car path is a form of Madness and they said that Humanity agging closer to catastrophe an iconic Doomsday Clock moves one second closer to midnight AS Global existential trat rates CL factors include nuclear weapons climate changes artificial intelligence infectious diseases and conflict in Ukraine and in the Middle East so we have arrived we need to to go on few more days of Labor amen and the promise of the changing of our body will take effect in our day we have seen all the scripture being fulfilled in our very eyes that's right but I would like to take the subject even unto the doors the doors and do speak of access or an entrance or an access to the opening of new things and we can certainly see that many doors have been open in this generation both good and evil as fulfillment of Prophecy of Daniel 12 that in the last days knowledge shall increase and people will run to and fro and S Gates will increase so there is a door opening and we certainly see that many doors have been opened in this end time both good and evil doors of Technology doors of science doors of educations doors of politics and doors of space exploration amen doors of artificial intelligence so many doors are being opened in this generation that's right and even the door of hell has been opened in this age and Demon Spirit are plooding into people's life through the eye of gates and all demonic influence of Hollywood we know that Revelation 9 was the opening up of the door of the bottomless pit so Revelation 9:1 to 3 and the fif Angel sounded and I saw a star fell down from heaven andto the Earth andto him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and there came out the smoke Locust upon the Earth and at them was given power as the Scorpions of the Earth have power and we say in the opening of the the the the bottom Le pit it is in fourth dimension which is the science and only through the radi wave of television or whatsoever Cuts up those spirit and it projected into a television they are real amen so we can see even in all the movies that they are they're showing all evils violence evil immorality all of that is projection that came from the opening of the bottomless feet amen we cannot see all around that but the televisions and the radio will pick it up and show it among the people and it influence the people who saw it that's right that's why people are now they are so violent immoral because something because hell is opening if hell is open then the tree of life is also open in last days Revelation 10 Hallelujah the book opened in the right hand of him that came down and we have now access to the Tree of Life once again which is the pure word of God Amen so to open a door you need to have an entrance in first second Peter first 111 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so we see the seventh angel of this hour has been ministering an entrance just as Noah's message ministered an entrance that caused his group to go through the door of the Ark in Noah's day there best be a ministering of the word of God Amen sir amen just like in the days of Noah remember that when when uh Jesus Christ expounded all this prophecy he said that they are asking when is the son of man coming and he said no one knows even the son don't know anything even the father don't know anything but he put a butt right but at it was in the days of Noah so shall it be right although he didn't explain it but he gave us a hint just like when he preached the seven seal in Christ The Mystery of God revealed God revealed the six seal but in chapter 8 there was silence and the prophet said it's good that he didn't reveal the seven seal but he has revealed it in types and shadows in the Old Testament that's likewise Jesus Christ as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man be amen so as it was in the days of Noah so shall also the coming of the Sun be a voice calling to come up hi through the door so the voice didn't come from the outside of the ACT but the voice came from inside the ark come into the ark so the voice is within the ark and the Ark is only have one door and that door is the Lord Jesus Christ amen Revelation 4:1 after this I look and behold a door was open in heaven after this after the seven Church ages because chapter three is the last of the loudan AG and after after the closing of the door in loud DEA there was a chapter four there was a voice again amen that called him come up here John and a door was open in heaven just like a door was opened in the ark and the first voice which I heard was it were of the trumpet talking with me which said come up hi and I will show you things which must be Hereafter amen there is a prophetic Ministry prophetic message that was given to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen he was no longer under the Candlestick light but there is an Open Door in heaven amen and J saw a door open in heaven and this voice that spoke to him was the voice of Christ calling him to come up hither through the door just as we found that it was the same voice calling no one his group to come up through the door and into the ark before the Judgment in Noah's time the same voice that called Noah come up here is the same voice that called JN in his last days doors give people entrance and access to whatever beyond the door and you need a key to the door and we know that we know that key is the Book of Revelation Revelation 10 gave us complete access to the tree of life which is Christ while Revelation chapter 9 has given us complete access to the tree of good and evil so the true trees is standing side by side today in our generation that is why the tree that Eve had complete access to in Eden we also have access to that same two trees again in this last days both of those trees that were in Eden are now with us again in this end time age that's right Hallelujah and so when JN who represent the end time believers saw a door open in heaven and heard the voice of Christ calling him to come up here in Revelation 4 and 1 there is always a voice not voices amen there are so many voices in these last days but J heard only one voice and that is the voice of the Sabbath angel in this last days there is no other messenger after this messenger amen hallelujah and we know that the voice was the same voice of Revelation chapter 7 which was the voice of the seventh angel and the voice was also the shout part of the Rapture Pace that gathered the bride together under her message in the bright AGS so there's no other voice outside of the voice of the seventh angel because the voice of the seventh angel start with a shout and that is the first Pace or the beginning cycle of the Rapture Am The Voice the shout and the Trump amen hallelujah so there's no other messenger outside of the seventh age messenger because he has already started the process of the changing of our bodies Hallelujah yes sir so we are now living in the time now when Lucifer is being united in an invisible Union with his subject by means of the door of Science and echology being open in this day but God is also uniting with his subject with is the bride hallelujah amen so when the seven seal was open we know that seal was Christ and when he opened up he gathered all his subject unto himself and what is his subject the bride it's no longer called you a church but I call you now a bride Hallelujah so there is an invisible Union between the bride and the groom in these last days improving his word paragraph 235 he said and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of men when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church not the church ages dispensation but the bride is called in that day the son of man will be revealed amen the son of man will be revealed we need to distinguish between the son of men and a son of men the one that is being revealed to the bride is the son of men not a son of men a son of men can commit mistake he is failable but the son of man is infallible he that mistakes so that's why the Bride of Jesus Christ can distinguish between a son of man and the son of man operating in one body because it is the revealing of the son of man and the son of man is Jesus Christ the word of God is being revealed in these last days and the Very purpose of the coming of the revealing of the son of man is to unite the word to the bride the bride is called yes yes sir yes sir we are already called Thank You Lord in that day the son of man will be revealed this is the day that the son of man the word of God is being revealed not the bride in that day the son of man what to join the church stood the head to unite that is the very purpose of the coming or the revealing of the son of man is to reveal the church to the head you the marriage of the Bride so there is an invisible Union between the bridegroom and the bride by the revealing of the son of men Hallelujah the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the son of man manifest himself in the person of William man bham a son of men that can commit mistake right that's why they say oh I don't believe brother he commit mistake that is true because he is a son of man that's right but the message don't make mistake because it is the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ revealed his word made manifest using the mouth of a and aen that's why we need to distinguish just like the Lord Jesus Christ he was the fullness of the goded body but when his ministry he will he become a dual person sometime he preach as a father amen when he made the Sam go and see no more and who can forgive sin right it's the father in him that forgive sin but he said when the son is in manifestation Hallelujah he said the son can do nothing within himself except what the father show him amen so we need to distinguish between the operation of God In the Flesh and the Son of God In the Flesh Hallelujah just like brother Brenham this in the son of man Ministry is coming he said th said the Lord th said the Lord never got wrong with that but when a son of man sometime he got discouraged sometime he has disappointment he has Earth AES yes but when the son of man stand Hallelujah who can stand behind him not even sickness not even cancer because it was the son of man and he said the Lord is here who are you speaking about the names it was not brother bam it was the son of man in the body of a son of man Hallelujah so the purpose of the son of man revealing is to unite praise God the groom and the bride thank you Jesus Hallelujah you Lord when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together church has to be the word amen because he is the word hallelujah so we need to recognize that we are a part of the word just like Adam Hallelujah when Adam was being made by thees In the Flesh The Mystery of the other side is still inside of him that's right then God separated e come on Amen and he said you are now bone of my bone and flesh of BL so the church need to be the word because he is the word amen hallelujah if we are the bride we need to be a part of the word of God in these last days that's the church to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of revealing of the son of men hallelujah hallelujah not the clergy man I don't know do you see what I mean is the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human placees Among Us and will make his word so real that it unite the church and him as one the bride and then she go home in the wedding supper amen hallelujah so we're now we we are waiting for the wedding supper which is the rupture because the marriage is already take place when the son of man made himself manifest In the Flesh yes sir prise God we see the visitation of God in this generation and we are so blessed that we are one of the beneficiaries thank you Lord of God's sending his bride I will send to you Elijah the prophet you is you don't give it to others that's right it's you thank you Lord for the blessing thank you Lord for your faithfulness will come down in human Place Among Us and will make his word so real that it unite the church and him as one the bride and then she go home to the wedding supper she's already United she's already United it's already done when you receive the word you are already United with Christ hallelujah hallelujah we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage feel your press and Sil all the Flesh of Mighty Men because the marriage of the Lamb has come but the rupture is going to the wedding supper hallelujah amen he is speaking of the last Trump amen stage of the rupture cycle of when our bodies are changed from Mortal to immortality and we physically leave the Earth at the last Trump amen praise the Lord when the word here unites with the person and they two become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church the the son of men the word and the church become one right whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing and the Propet of the word now is in the bride and she knows what he wants done with the word because she has th set the Lord as brother R said that the word the final voice is now in the bride we are united Hallelujah through marriage in these last days yes sir just like when AB Abraham we we are already United by God's grace amen excuse me amen this will be an exciting time for us when we know who we are that's right right we have so many trials but and sometimes we are drawn by the trials but nevertheless the word of God is in you praise the Lord Revelation 3:20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice come and open the door I will come into to him and will stap with him and he with me that's right we notice here that the opening of the door is connected to being able to receive the truth of this hour because Christ knocking was the knocking of the fruit of the message of this hour so to open the door and let Christ in for Fellowship is to receive the message of the hour and Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet amen so we have wait for seven Church ages until the seventh angel could begin to sound and God could give us back the key that could open the door to immortality by giving us access to the thought of god of what Adam had fellowship with the thought of God before the fall began so we are now returning back to the original so that's why we we just don't know him as a Creator but we know him as a redeemer amen when you know him as a Creator just like Revelation 4 when the seven seal was still Clos all those illers worship us worship him as a great Creator yes yes he is a Creator even Angel worshiping as a Creator and sometimes if we know him just a Creator we can ask anything Lord give me this Lord give me job Lord give me money Lord give me this Lord give me that Lord give me this because you are just seeing him as a great Creator who provides everything yeah but when the seal was open in Revelation chap 5 amen hallelujah it be the worship is now focused not on the Creator but a redeemer thank you Lord for you have redeemed us going back to the original place because the book is a book entitled de of a redemp at our inheritance where our name lays in that book so when they saw it they worship him as a redeemer and they sing a new song song is written by inspiration and this new song means new revelation that was given to them I always said that when I was in when I was uh before my conversion I love music but music don't love me but thank God when I received the message of the hour I sing a new song and I realize that worldly music dwell mostly on broken relationship that's right of huraches of desperations of rebellion amen but when the grace of God come into my heart I begin to sing a new song of Hope of Courage of inspiration of Love of Mercy that's why when we recognize him as a great Redeemer you need to worship him because being a redeemer it becomes a personal relationship and I no longer call you a church but I call you a bride because we are redeemed back again death and mortality entered in men when men was separated from The Fellowship Of God but immortality is restored when fellowship with God is restored I believe that we are being restored now by the opening of the word amen in the message conflict between God and Satan he said into the ark he went and when he went into the ark you know what God shut the door oh my no nobody had to shed it but God shed it am that's it remember when he heard the word come into the ark come up here to John and Jen responded to the voice and he entered through that one door and God shut the door when God shut the door no one can open it because when God sealed you Satan is being sealed out Hallelujah likewise when had open the door no one can close it thank you Jesus for some of you the door is still open those of you who all all of you who have not received the call of God yet the door is open and no one can close it if you are the seat of God the door is still open for you but if you can come in and God shut the door no one can open it hallelujah praise the Lord amen when God sealed you sealed you until the day of your Redemption thank you Lord that's our consolation praise the Lord just like forestation when I shared it to my friend an Apostolic Minister I already shared it but I want to share it once again and I show him the scripture in Ephesians 1:6 I told him do you believe in predestination because the prophet said predestination for the Pentecostal are really scary for them but since I opened the scripture and I said do you believe that we are predestinated unto adoption by Jesus Christ he cannot say no because it was he's reading it so what he did is just okay I believe it predestinated how do you know you know that you are pred inated if you keep on going to church but if you start but if you stop going to church that mean that you're are not predestinated I thought is that so and he gave me another example for example you are riding in the train and for some reason you fell up on the train then how can you be predicate when you fall up the train and the train will leave you right and I told him well let me share to you my understanding of pred destination according to your example and I said well if you're riding a train and you fell off from the train God will stop the train put you back in the train until you reach your destination because you are predestinated unto adoption no one can hinder it just like when God shut the door in Noah stand no one can open it you will be going to your destination praise the Lord but here's the powerful statement of the Prophet listen close when you take God's word and follow God's word there's many times that after you already done all you can do your faith is put to a test that's right we believe Hallelujah that we are already in yes sir we believe all the prophets we do all we can to believe the word of God Amen and God shout and seal us but the prophet said many times that you'd ever already done all you can do be prayerful go to the church everything that you want to do to please the Lord all you can do but your faith is put to a test remember you are already in the ark and this is not a test to prove his faith this is a test to reveal his faith that's right sir because he that endureth unto the end will be saved even though we're looking for the changing of our body our testing does not does not stop when we say we are already sealed no that's right even before the changing maybe a few minutes before the Rapture our testing is still going on Sir amen yes sir just like Abraham so I will swing a little bit Genesis chapter 22 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham so God is tempting or testing Abraham right not to prove his faith because God already proved his faith chapter 12 up to 2021 God is already convinced of the faith of Abraham that's why he tempted once again for the last time he said and it came to pass a third this thing that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham he said behold here I am no hesitation because only God changed his name from Ab AB to Abraham so when God called him Abraham he immediately know that it was God calling him no Shadows of doubt that's right because he has already experienced it for how many ups and downs in his life but when God allow came in to pass after the that God time when he said take now thy son thy only son amen who he waited for 25 years come on then maybe another year he grew maybe 15 18 years and Abraham began to love Isaac amen but the time has come and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee upon one of the mountains no direct right no direct place to go at the very end God is still testing so we need to be always in constant communication with God amen amen one of the man and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isak his son and caved the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him he didn't waste any time that's right God didn't tell him the exact place to have a he just go by faith whatever the Lord leads I will just follow amen that's why somebody ask me how do you know the will of God well the will of God is always in his word outside of his word that is not the will of God because he says seek ye first the kingdom of God all these things shall be so by faith Abraham goes to a place that God told him with no direct place or specific place to offer his son just go by faith and on the third day lifted up his eye and saw the place a part up so three days journey he had so many times to change his mind amen I waed this for 25 years another 18 years I grow this child I become to love him and he is my test testimony right yeah that's it of the promise of God in my life but nevertheless he didn't change his mind praise the Lord and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass I and the lad will go Yer and worship and come again to you God told him to sacrifice his son but he told those two lad wait here and we will come back that's right Hallelujah at the very end he was tested of his faith God God wants to to to to manifest his faith up to the last end yes sir he agreed that he will sacrifice Isaac but he told the two Lads wait here and I'll go and worship God and we'll come back amen praise the Lord that because Abraham knew that whatever happened to ISA even if he had killed him upon the mountain God would still have had to keep his word and bring a nation out of Isaac's seed so Abraham knew that somehow he would have to return with Isaac because the death of Isaac could not stop the promise of God inde the I Will Bless thee and your seed after your seed so even if he killed Isaac God is going to raise him up that's right up to the last end of the trial just like when Noah end into the ark and God shut it up to the last minute God is still testing him amen praise that's why sometimes our testings in life oh I've already in the message why this happen I pray for Financial Freedom why I am being down on I pray for healing why it is that my family is being I pray for safety why there's no actually every time you ask God is an opposite answer and sometimes we feel the lukewarmness but we claim that we are the bride but we cannot deny we are still affected by the laress of this L this year that's right that's true so we are being tested and Noah went in he followed the will of God and God shut the door behind him but it never r for seven more days wonder what Noah thought all the time in there wonder what our thought being the Bride of Jesus Christ why this happen to me why this happen to my children why this happened to my family I claim I am a believer the word isn't me I speak the word why is still happening is there any different to Noah when God shut the door but God still testing him amen but the only thing even though we have so many trials the only thing we are already sealed sometimes we forgot that we are already sealed so that's why we get nervous we get so anxiety what will we do what you're already sealed just wait because if God promis he is obligated to fulfill what he promised Hallelujah sometimes we are in a hurry to fulfill what we pray but God has a better plan because he said my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and my ways are better than your ways patience is virtue Noah sitting in the ark on the door shut he thought just anytime children you'll hear will so he's speaking to the children now that the door was shut anytime soon my brother and sister my son and sister we we will hear the pouring out of brain they were so excited Hallelujah will pull the door and LD up here on top and they was up on the top floor you know the animals on the bottom the bridge the next and they see the Sun and oh the morning there will be something over there dark and the rain will come but the next morning up come the Sun what a great disappointment oh the ruptor is coming the ruptor is coming the r is coming but when they come up to the third floor and when they open the lead of the door the sun is coming up amen preach it their faith is put to test not to prove his faith but to reveal his faith amen yes sir until when he will hold to the promise of God Amen and maybe some people that kind of halfway believe Noah might went up there and stood around the ark and they said you know what that old man might have been right we'd better stand here when then they seen a mistake they seen a mistake because they didn't happen just as what Noah is preaching he preached for 120 years but when the door was shut people are waiting yeah for the flood to come and there's no flood and they become to sculp become to ridicule oh this is fake Prophet have we been hearing this in our day oh this is false prophet didn't come to pass he he made commit mistakes but the prophet said they seen a mistake God's prophets make no mistake and God's word Can't Fail Hallelujah remember that my brother and sister we can fail as a you the flesh but the word of God will never fail because what he promis is able to perform it there's always a test in the message absolute God said and God gave Noah trial accepting his absolute yes yes no went into the ark God shut the door behind him no doubt they said now in the morning the be black out and there'll be thunder and lightning and rain will fall but you know the next day the sun come up just as bright as it ever did yeah look at that sometimes it happened to us oh we are already sealed we are already bride but when Trouble Comes sometimes we doubt Our Testimony amen maybe I'm not the bride after all because this twice and testing it seems I cannot go or move on but the prophet said Remember the door was already shut and God put a test in it praise the Lord praise God Amen and God gave Noah a trial after accepting his absolute no went into the ark God shut the door behind him no doubt they said now in the morning there'll be black clouds and there been Thunders and lightning and rains will fall but you know the next day the sun come up just as bright as it ever did but then the second day the sun was just bright as it was third fourth six and even the seventh day but Noah had climbed up in the upper room instead of going down instead of opening the door he climbed up on the top am he let his faith rise up amen he didn't do the PD party he didn't wait for seven days he went up hear the voice come up here again come up Noah amen he waited for seven days he wait for seven Church ages then a voice came come up here johnise Lord and on the seventh morning when there come a time when people had refused God's abs abolute the way of salvation of saving the lives of people then rains begin to fall and the sewer f up and the boat be to rise and it took Noah and D to safety sure because they were trusting in God's word the absolute God's Word of Promise Amen in verse 75 he said no matter how bad it seems like and how dark it gets still believe your [Applause] absolute amen Hallelujah that's why the greatest trial is in our day that's right but God already shut you up or seal you up the trial is only to show your faith in this absolute word of God in Hebrew 10:23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise Thessalonian 5:21 prove all things hold fast that which is good what is good the opening of the word there's nothing good about the opening of the word opening of the word that make me understand who I am in the program in the mind of God Amen and I personally believe that at the end it will look like for a while that this message had failed on some has been in the message for 20 30 years B then you'll just hear that they just turn away from the message of the and they said there's really nothing in the message of the it's just like an ordinary just like everybody else the prophet Comm make mistakes and all of that all all the comments but for the Bride of Jesus Christ this is real because we are not following a son of man but we are following the son of man even they say that what they saying is true even if we say that they what saying is true that the prophet commit mistakes I was not converted because of the person of brother BR I was converted because he introduced me to the son of man which is the word of God and even the prophet don't make me as your absolute my absolute is the word of God in this last days I am said valuable but the word is infallible cannot commit mistakes that's why we have confidence in his faithfulness in our day our trial is to prove what he invest in our heart amen every time he put a revelation he will test that Revelation if that Revelation really come from God but if you say if you have a revelation it come from a man it will be tested it will be proven and that Revelation if is just your own Revelation you will turn away from the message that's right that's right but when the rebel struck your heart God is going to prove it that it was really his Revelation that was given to you praise the Lord just like Cain when God revealed to Cain the revelation of the sacrifice what Cain expressed was the revelation of God he offered to God and God accepted it but C he offered a sacrifice to the altar according to his Revelation and when the time come God did accept it but God is so gracious if you do what your brother do I will accept your sacrifice but he didn't accept it because he has no part in it that's right hallelujah amen no one is family sat and after seven hot days of this you can imagine what it must have been like for them to wait and wait and wait there is a waiting time there is a testing time that's right amen this message is realistic or real in our lives amen this is not just like a pav that we made a story will be interrupt no this is real Battle River Revelation upon revelation of the word of God in Exodus 19:1 16 and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceedingly loud so that the people that was in the camp trembled notice not a third day but a cloud amen a cloud and the voice of the trumpet we have seen a cloud and have heard the voice of a trumpet in this hour praise the Lord amen Revelation 41 and I and after this I look and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which have come up hither into there and I will show the things which must be herea there is a cloud there is a thundering there is a trumpet and in Noah's day we know that it was around the time of when the door was being shut that the mysterious Cloud appeared in the sky just as we have seen the same mysterious Cloud appearing in this day so this is not a coincidence that the mysterious Cloud appeared February 28 1963 and we know that the appearing of the cloud in Noah's day was a sign of judgment to that generation just as it was in this generation amen because the judge of all is already coming down a white wig but to no one is group it was a sign of redemption Amen to those who don't accept to the to the to the word of Noah it is a judgment but for no one is group it was a Redemption time that's right prise amen Redemption for them that believe in the prophet message for that hour so the same door that shut in no one is group but the same door that also gave them access into the new world after the Judgment had passed amen hallelujah amen Revelation 3:20 again I would like to read it and behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will stop with him and he with me if any man hear my voice his personal message to the church that's right if any man this is now an individual amen yes sir you must first hear the voice of Truth in this hour and then receive the truth by the spirit of God revealing it to you personally and then you will begin to have fellowship with God as of Adam had before the fall because the same mind that was in Christ is now becoming clear to our mind and thoughts thank you Lord what was revealed to Adam is now being revealed unto us amen amen that we are not another part of God but we are a part of God hallelujah I will come into him and S with him and he with me so supper time is an evening time meal right it's fellowship with Christ is the invisible Union of the bride of Christ of being united together by the word of this hour it's just like the bright AGS just like Ruth and boas it's back to hien again of the fellowship that God and Adam had together before the fall because it is the restoration time amen God was revealed in Christ now Christ in his many membered body then the restoration Back to Eden again hallelujah hallelujah God is knocking on the door with the word of Truth as spoken to the seventh Angels voice in this hour God is still knocking to someone here yes God is still have an open door thank you Lord and if he has an open door no one can shut it you need to come don't wait for tomorrow because when God shut the door no one can open it we find in Revelation 4 is an Open Door to them who have heard the voice of the word of this hour and have received the truth of this age into their mind and heart and it is very same word that causes this group to be caught up into the first stage of the rupture cycle the Shelf is the first stage of the rupture cycle amen and it is happening now amen you are hearing the voice of God you are hearing the shout of God Wednesday Sunday ministering Brothers coming in having the shout of God hallelujah praise the Lord I trust that this will become an encouragement to each and every one of us am We Have Heard a Voice of in this hour that Jan heard called him up hi the voice that Jan heard is the same voice that is calling up come up hi come up higher little man as J was caught up and the evening is that that it will be receiving truth of these hours continue to advance amen the evidence that you are being caught up is that you continue to hear the word of the Lord thank you you don't stop God put a hunger and thirst in your righteousness and the prophets why did why do you hunger and thirst church because it's your heavenly father trying to reveal this mystery unto you thank you Lord yes sir it is all God's doing that's right it was by God's grace that we still come to the church we still enjoy the preaching amen amen we can still Worship the Lord Jesus Christ then if we are part of this which we are do you believe it that we are part of this word amen then it is impossible for us not to have a body change in this hour that's right praise the Lord do you believe it if you believe the word of God it is impossible for you not to have a body change because we already recognize God's viation in our day that's right just like when Abraham he was sitting in the tth door and we know that the T door was Christ that's why the 10or was Christ that's why when the Three Angels come in because he has the open door he has the Revelation because he was waiting in the tent door which is type of CH is the reveal word when the three Angel come he said my Lord instead of my Lord's that's right amen because he already cut the Revelation amen praise the Lord amen and he's already serving those angels he's serving and those Angel then State their their purpose of coming they just allow Abraham to serve them yes sir in milk in meat or maybe in cake or dessert coffee whatsoever amen they're enjoying it they never State their purpose of coming right they just wait for Abraham to finish praise the Lord then after they are satisfied they stated their purpose where is Sarah thy wife the purpose of God's bation in these last days Luther didn't make it he just saw justification Wesley just saw sanctification the Pentacost saw another full of grace but there was silence and there's the voice that's go come up here to J I show you things to come am there was an open book a closed book in chapter 5 it was an open book then in chapter 10 that open book was given to the seventh angel to broadcast the very purpose of God's coming Hallelujah the seven seal was open to God there he's subject unto himself which is the Bride of Jesus Christ the visitation of the angel in time of of of Abraham was for Sarah the bride and the visitation to give them strength to conceive the visitation of the angel in our day to together is subject to create the rupturing faith in the heart of the Bride hallelujah hallelujah so you cannot stop your body from being changed in this hour because the cycle of the change has already begun in your life yes your soul has already been changed from doubt to Faith yes sir from Darkness to light from ignorance to truth you have already been quickened and Made Alive by the light of this hour hallelujah our changing of the body is a sure promise of God so let us stand first Thessalonian 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the message of the hour and with a voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together in the cloud to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with this word we need to comfort one another our time is too short the word to an individual is already being shot but our faith need to be tested stay in your absolute amen stay in the word no matter what trials you may have stay with the word remember the door was already shut behind you but your faith is being tested stay with the word amen just like the vision of stay in line with the word that's don't do it online amen there so much confusion online but stay in line with the word of God because the revealed word is already complete there will be no other voice outside of the voice of the seventh angel amen because the Rapture
