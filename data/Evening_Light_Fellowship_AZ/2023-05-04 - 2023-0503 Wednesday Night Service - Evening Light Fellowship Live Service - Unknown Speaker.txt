Reigns unending love Amazing Grace [Music] God bless you everyone a ritual in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ tonight [Music] are you here I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ yeah it is a privilege to be in the house of the Lord to be once again in his presence foreign to be particular of disgrace what an amazing grace to have lay down his life for us to be this God who sees our path who knows what we have to go through at times we look around and we wonder why why me but he's the master of it all he has everything under his control and the more on a daily basis he reveals himself to us declare a division becomes the more precise we know how to work the more we know how to lean not unto our own understanding because our understanding is our greatest enemy because at times we wonder we think that our understanding is the way to go but this Amazing Grace despite of our understanding it comes down you reaches doubt he wants us to understand that he is in control amen while we are standing we'll take a quick reading of the scripture I believe the Lord knows how to lead the things around when we wonder how to go what to do how to proceed he is in control and we love it when he's in control but it's not always pleasant when we don't know it's not always Pleasant we'll take the book of Luke's chapter 22. verse 24. and there was also a strive among them meaning the disciples which of them should be accounted the greatest and he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is Chief has he that do serve shall we pray Heavenly Father surely that Grace this Amazing Grace has taken us from places where we were and leading us one step at a time to where we are to be father surely as we are guarded in thy house in thy presence in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we desire a low father to hear from you because when Moses was lifted up in the mountain he was not just to go out there and leave people back there in the wilderness and unto themselves but it required him to go a little higher to be able to start seeing things that ought to be Almighty savior as we are getting into Thy word may you be with my mouth everything Lord that shall be said be unto your glory any place Lord that he could be my being may your father God remove and Lord be with the congregation my brothers and sisters you know their hearts you know their conditions you know everything they have need us may you attend unto them Father let Lord father God the word be receiving no heart we do not want to become the Greeks where we just sit and debate upon it and think of it Lord but Lord we need to be transformed little father and to become a new being yes as we as Lord with Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated once again ritual in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ it is uh a privilege for me to stand Among Us to be able to share what the Lord has in store for us on this day want to thank uh brother Run for the trust and the opportunity and all of you again who reached out a few days back to see me again and that was for me a little bit of a confirmation that the work must be done because at times when you have to preach and you're getting all these things left and right and you wonder if that will be beneficiary and but the Lord knows how to quieten us a little bit it's not always the church saying like Lord I need I need I need even the preachers themselves they go through the same process and and at times it's very painful and you don't know who to talk to at that time because you only have the Lord to assist you in that manner and hazy keeps assisting us he gives us one step at a time uh you know as human being we like to know everything like you know how it's gonna be and how I'm going to do this and figure out everything and and be at ease but then there won't be a civilization of faith then Faith wouldn't be wouldn't matter anymore but as he lays out his program it's just like you know here a little deal little and we get it and we get it and we might not even get it at times when he speaks to us you know like the children of uh Israel in the wilderness and to them was Thunders they didn't understand you heard the voice but it was thunderous it was painful in the ears like we can't hear such a things that's way too much for us to be handled you know you know that's for the pastors that's for the ministers you know but then the Lord himself knows that you know he had to have ministers around and to be able to take those Thunders and break it down low by low day by day uh even the ministers themselves before they stand on the pulpit you know they ever had a journey it's not an overnight element for them to stand up and preach those big elements so that the church expected times and stuff but the Lord Knows Why yeah everything is done the way down it's done uh we see here in the book of uh Luke chapter 22 the Lord Jesus himself having a congregation in his congregation we understand that he was the son of man revealed on that day and he came for a specific purpose but according to Luke 6 yeah he continued all night in prayer I went to select evangelize he evangelize and in the campaign he gathered a number of people and the people came the church the church started and people started coming and people were following different elements first pull second pull to pull all wonderful things he was so wonderful the church was good but then as he was working with them he knew exactly what the condition of the people were but then also among them you know quickly when you have a group of people people become clenished you know I get along better with this one and you know this is my friend I don't really like him you know he's always he's not really the type of people that I'll hang out with and stuff then they started they wanted to have a certain organization in the church so therefore it is said and there was also a Strife among them he was not an easy element why him he's supposed to be me I've been here longer I'm the oldest oh I'm the youngest you know this now the time of the young people you know with all the quotations in the message they were able to use and Jesus looked at them and said well that's good that you have all these elements before you you know all this criteria like you know this one has to be this and it says I know you are the Church of the Living God because I continued all night in prayer it was not just join a church go there and start preaching the son doeth nothing except he has sin done by the father to build the Wilder the Tabernacle in the wilderness Moses has to go up on the mountain and to be able to see the things that are to be the same way Jesus also continued all night to be able to bring out a church to be able to be the bread of Jesus Christ but then this church is in a condition this church is looking and wanting now to have status they want to be known with a certain name with a certain title you know I am this you know I'm the one who does this I'm the master accountant in the church you know brother Judah could be there you know oh you know I'm well spoken Peter could say because he has everything to say at all time you know he's very outspoken and you have John on his hand he's a very quiet man you know he's a lovely guy he doesn't speak as much you know so now there was a strive you know no we need a leader a leader who's quiet oh that that means you should be John no no no no no we need you know with the Pharisees and everything we need to have somebody who can speak that should be peter than there was a Strife among them and this happens also in the church this happens in the families this happens among the brothers and the siblings at home mommy is supposed to be mine he has to listen to me I'm the older brother the parent runs through every life and Jesus says he looks at them he understands them he said the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors Jesus now is talking to them by condensing a lot of those things in that one sentence because when Jesus comes on the scene it was the reign of the Romans the land was governed by the Romans structured and everything but then where did the Gentiles came from why would Jesus turn around and speak about the Gentiles regarding the church who's only having strives among themselves because the spirit has to see what's going on in the church and has to know where that Spirit came from because it's easier to tell somebody dressed this way then you have to be this way but then Burnham said I stood there in the prayer line and discernment and attract the spirit by tracking the spirit he was able to know exactly where that stubbornness came from because at times the church the pastor is pulling the church to a certain level but then as long as certain elements are not addressed that church is not going anywhere and Jesus is dealing with the very same thing he's looking at them and said the Gentiles also do the same thing they also want to be structured like the Gentiles they want to have titles like the Gentiles and Jesus said ye shall not be so because you are called unto a certain purpose but then for them to be able to receive it they must have the revelation of what Jesus is saying and what is a revelation is just God giving us more information about the prophecy so we can better understand and better receive it because if we don't have more knowledge on the thing more information on the subject matter then it becomes hard why does the pastor only wants us to be this way why does are they doing this to me why has to be me because we understand quickly that the church or the believer is in a condition of lack of knowledge that's why the word said my people die because of what lack of knowledge it's not the knowledge of reading because today we have the message at the end of everyone but then the understanding by the spirit can only come to those that guided sin that will come through the messenger and the son of man reveal and under that umbrella then the Revelation comes to them because the Gentiles were there also in the time of Jesus like everybody else the Pharisees were there fewer people clean people nothing to reproach them but then this conversation is not made on a public stand but is made only to a specific group of people in a specific place and a Time the pattern of the gentle church or the Gentile nations in the end times we see that in the time that Jesus was talking we find that Jesus is referring them to the Gentiles but then the Gentiles came from somewhere Genesis 11 verse 1 and the whole earth was one language and of one speech and it came to pass that as the journey from the East that they found a plan in the land of China and they and they dwelt there and they say it one to another go to let us make brick and burn them throughly and they had brick for stone and slime and head and they uh they and they for murder and they say go to let us build a city and the tower whose top May uh would stop May reach unto heaven and let us make us a name the very same thing that the disciple was sitting there wanting also to become there were also people in Genesis 11 who also wanted to become that but then what did he do with doing that they didn't know that what we are doing is only leading us to a certain chaos but then to them it seems very nice to follow something like you know nice to embrace but then Jesus says ye shall not be like them but then for them to understand it it requires not to break it down to bring it into details for them to understand like you know watch the way you're going and look at where he's going to get you and then the church will have to make a choice because as I said there was also one among them who would also want to who was also going to make a choice Judas of either following what Jesus was going to say all going to choose his own ways because he also wanted to have himself make himself a name and Jesus now is pointing Us in the word he said that the Gentiles behave in a certain manner they say they join in the land they come into a certain area they say let us make a make us a name let less we discarded abroad upon the first of the the whole of the earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the Tower with the children of men build it the purpose in their heart they were able to sit down and agree that we are able to do this since we are able to do this it is not important for us to make us a name the Bible Church age Bible is the original name for Babylon it means confusion it was literally it was literally started by by Kush the son of a son of ham but was brought to a kingdom of power and Grandeur under his son Nimrod the mighty Hunter Nimrod according to the Genesis 11 which we just read our account and also according to the prophet history set out to accomplish three things while the church was sitting there was looking at it people of one language they can do anything people can agree just as in five six seven people let's do this let's make this happen and they wanted to have a name and they wanted to become structured in a certain manner and also then among them raises now a man from the line of ham who goes out now to start structuring the whole thing you started dividing the whole Nations this is the guy who goes to a city who thinks that he has the understanding then everybody else sets everything in place divides the people according to his understanding it started dividing the Earth what do you see nations in the Earth what do you see culture starts creeping in I am from the north you are from the south but then before that the Earth was of one language one speech everybody looked into it some Direction but then here now we have a man that thinks that he is well spoken he has the understanding of the earth and knows how to rule the people and why was he doing that it was because he had certain purpose to accomplish to attain without even the rest of the people realizing that he is following this year at times says watch that you do not become clenish in the church watch that you do not just cling yourself to a certain type of people because behind it then this one start influencing I'm the most prominent person here I'm the person that the people listen to the most quickly watch the pattern of the word quickly watch how those people starting to go quickly this is the person that will go into the houses and start convincing people he doesn't know how to preach he doesn't know how to do this he doesn't know how to do this let's leave the church and I'll just be preaching more Mysteries than he does he wanted to make himself a name he wanted to have a strong nation and how does it go about to make a strong Nation divide the people without them realizing that his is coming he talks to one brother then he turns around to the next brother then he tells him a different thing then when they bump heads then it's like no it's not me he's following a certain thing he is following a certain objective and Jesus is looking at the disciples he said that you have seen the you have seen eligible prophets in your day you have seen how the Pharisees and the Roman system have killed him and you're standing here and you also want to become again like the Gentiles don't you remember what happened with in the time of Solomon when the people rejected the the prophet and they wanted to become like the rest of the world people had forgot they started to forget what was what just happened a few months ago people just forgot what happens few centuries ago because somebody understood how men behave because somebody Nimrod understood on how to get to the people he said how am I going to get to them the word shows us that he wanted to build a strong Nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which also he accomplished which shall also happen the same way but then the question is to what degree are you going to be partake of that project because we would say like you know the denominations they'll be out there it's like no Jesus is dealing with people under the umbrella of the message he's not dealing with uh with with with the Gentiles out there but they say like you know look at the parent of the Gentiles among you look at the ways creeping among you look at what style started to take place among you because actually my uh my title is uh the the super race and with the subject is the pattern of the of gentle nations in the end times the Lord is showing that I want to have a kingdom I want to have a people but then these people is in a certain condition and as the people are seated they think like you know let's just go to church let's just go attend church let's let us here is a good sermon today let us hey have an amen but they don't understand how to watch the environment they don't understand how important it is for them to watch what is the makeup because at times we are we are we um at times we we are partake of a certain makeup that puts us in a condition that we don't even say it but that condition drives us slowly but surely to do things that are contrary to the world because when Nimrod comes he doesn't tell you like you know I'm nimrod I have these three objectives that I'm going to do no very subtle very cunning how are you you're doing good oh Eve what is this I don't know but you know if I show you if you come to my church I'm going to teach you on how to use this really Pastor Adam never preached this this has never happened to us nobody has ever explained this to me it seems so naive it shows you the entire word to a certain extent you are already placed in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus to be this but then the strive among the disciples is to have one greater among them which they were already aware if you do this you're going to become God wish they were already but they didn't have more information for them to understand who they were they didn't have the Revelation they will give them the Insight of what's going on to understand the makeup of the Garden of Eden yes there was prayer line you were a monkey you are lying you are this you deep speak tree and that but they did not know that there was another guy in the land with also another objective and that's important it goes about Indonesians dividing the land structuring the land calling this part here Shina calling this part here Nineveh calling this part here certain City why is it doing that he wants to build a strong Nation a better one than Michaels oh Michael doesn't know what he's doing he just has people wandering around the world and people just go up and down no I have to organize them let me organize them after being after being able to organize them then brings in the politics oh you know this one yeah you know actually like you know we are the almost a Sapient you know we are more intellectual Superior let's divide it even deeper you know 200 IQ 100 what is it doing dividing the land make wanting to make a name for himself is going into people's lives oh you are short to you at all you are fat you are small it comes into the the society fat is not good you have to be slender Oh short is not good put some high heels what is it doing is structuring the land is dividing the land brother Burnham says watch where our sisters stand then you know where the church is at why because the pressure of society that Nimrod has brought about now pushes them now to conform to a certain element because them also by Nature since they lost Beauty they have to align with a certain thing and when they get trapped in the same web they also want to have also a name for themselves oh that's the sister that dresses this way that's the brother oh is the one that finances the church while he's doing that what is he doing only making a name for himself becoming more known better known in the church oh she's the most beautiful girl in the church name for himself Jesus said ye shall not be so because I want to prepare you a kingdom because in that Kingdom he that is beautiful be the servant of others you have the money be the servant of others but not here because the world is standing they want to have a name we like to be respected we don't like to be uh to be looked down at we like to be seen as somebody important amen because he knows he has a project because he knows I want to be worshiped I want when when I come in the church oh God bless or without you we don't know what this church will be you want to be worshiped and he shall be worshiped the word said that he shall do it and nothing we're going to preserve to prevent it the church is looking but they don't know what they're looking at they see somebody appearing what is the project of this guy where is the pastor leading the church to who is exalted in the church who is exalted in the house who is exalted in the society look at Society you want to have a name start undressing yourself start putting yourself out there you'll have a name you want to be regarded as a star start doing what Nimrod is telling you and you shall see you're going to get it That's What Judas should talk like you know hey I'll go you know make myself I'll get myself along with her the bigger people in the land the Pharisees and the sadly season be known among the among the Romans and things but the Lord says you shall not be so it is not easy to move now from Bad makeup from that environment that Society into a different Kingdom because the word shows us that when Nimrod went about he wanted to paint a picture that looks so innocent it has to look very innocent you know I'm not showing much you know it's just a little it's just not that tight very innocent the word says that this Niners is the Nimrod of the Bible we can confirm by by comparing history with the Gentile the Genesis account Pompeo said the nine is king of Assyria changed the ancient moderate ways of life by Desire by the desire for Conquest he was the first who carried war against his neighbors when it comes when it says woes you don't see somebody with the chores and with the guns and you're going to obey me no but with the tongue with the speech look at the first the first of the first seal it comes with a white West horse he's looking at people oh you are this okay yeah don't worry yeah we'll get to you yeah we'll see how you know don't worry like you know we are one people you know yeah this is like you know we are the Church of the Living God you know but behind it but behind it oh Church what day are we living in where we see that people are coming so humble so simple but yet a project behind it the word shows that as Nimrod comes into a land it starts to divide the people and when he divides the people is not doing it because he loves the people is not to set the people free is giving people knowledge that makes them think that now I am more independent but is only giving them those information to straight them slowly step by step slowly step by step what are we oh we are the Church of the Living God but he comes for war as it comes forward it stands around he looks at the church it divides the land it structures the people he introduces culture and the culture becomes now a way of living oh we we we from the north we love this type of food are we from the south we love this type of food the word shows that Nimrod comes it conquers the land it gives them a culture you bear with me as the Lord is leading me here it gets in among the people it shows them like you know hey the way you used to live it's of a lower class in other words now I'm going to make a civilization let me introduce civilization to you don't speak the language that you used to speak before because people under the Jehovah are one time they were peaceful you're coming in the church you find that people are peaceful people get along with each other Asbury Burnham shows us that there was a time that after service everybody will gather outside there with a pot of beans we all of us would eat but then as now civilization start coming in then they start telling you if you eat with somebody you don't know you can get a disease it's a fact that when you eat with something that you don't know you can get a disease but then the civilization of faith is slowly being removed among the people yet they can say it but quickly here now comes a way of living that is based on mistrust who is he where is he from oh we don't get along with them yeah we can have them Among Us but we are not part of them but look how slow how small did they start we don't even understand why when we see certain people quickly we close up we just close ourselves up why because the makeup of society accept the people over ones of one language on one speech to become now people of a certain tribe of a certain country of a certain state of a certain City of a certain group of a certain Church as from this church we don't go with people of that church and this was taking place in the church I'm not out there in the church and what were they doing it because they also wanted to make themselves a name amen and has the wanted to be known the biggest church in town the largest group of it all then Along Comes religion the interpretation of things we have the greatest revelation they don't have the revelation quickly the ministry among the people started dying out that's why even when Jesus sent the disciples out he said go pray for the sick and do everything they went out there they find somebody who was not part of them they said like you know we stopped them why because the Same Spirit of nimrod among the church Among The People Under the Umbrella of the message started dividing if without even them the people realizing that they were dividing they paid themselves Jesus was shaping now the church and said my beloved Brothers my beloved sisters understand where the source of your culture came from understand where the nationalities came from understand why do you have all these black white yellow green and all these things because said God created the men after his own image likeness then comes along the Romans the Roman came they said well we see what everybody else have done since they want to make everybody be equal let's give them that equality he gives them the equality they said everybody is equal before the word before the law everybody is equal you think they are but Obama say no it's just by words the source of it we need to become something and since some people have to be lower than others it is important for us to break them to have discrimination laws it's not necessarily said out there we will discriminate against these people but then they just tell you ah you know dear people they can do what they want to do but we can have them here Among Us I'm showing you what nimro that started in Genesis how it comes through the ages how it developed and how it gets into the church because once we don't say this we will have a church called The Church but without the power of the Living God because the God said that you are the kingdom of the Living God but that being the king in the kingdom of God is not the fact of saying like you know brother I love you brother come along no Jesus said you who are greater become the servant of those to become a servant it requires you now first to remove your status to put it on the side for you to become serving others and to serve others it is not an easy thing I work for you in this house and you don't respect me no you have to become a servant first because him the greater of them all came down to serve to lay down his life for a certain type of people but then when the same people who once was the greater in dividing and destroying Nations and changing cultures and and implementing new cultures be new ways and work generation and all kinds of things and lgbtq all these things is bringing these things around it's not to free the people because he wants to be worshiped and Along Comes religion oh the lgbtq the of the brothers like us let's accept them in the church let's not have discrimination oh you have to respect each other's uh a feeling sexual orientation but that didn't start that way it started like you know oh you people uh the way you living we have to we have to upgrade you you know go to school get the knowledge and become intellectual the more intellectual you are the more you understand life no the more intellectual you are the more confused you are the more confused you are sir what is a man uh but he has a PHD he doesn't know what a man he is he doesn't know what a woman is nimrod he had a purpose in his mind and this pardon of things started creeping in the church oh me I don't like this type of people you know we are in the message but you know really some people really you know really that's good I know ministers understand what I'm talking about they deal with certain things in the churches sister what's wrong it's like you know you know you know brother what's wrong you know you know you know you go behind it's the same spirit you follow behind it's the same spirit they might not say it but it's in them it's in the gene why they behave the way they behave brother Branham said the girl is so stubborn she doesn't understand why she's stubborn she doesn't even think that she's wrong she doesn't even understand why she like to wear high heels nevertheless they preach him they preacher the preacher the preacher but she doesn't just there's no place in her to receive that word what is that who started it not her father not her grandfather not her ancestor but nimrod in 1953 as they discovered on how to how to make the the makeup people's makeup they can know like you know you from North Africa you you are a mixture of yourself in East and left and right and all these things people people are the result of the mixture and they don't understand a level of stubbornness a level of a lack of humility to the world because something came from somewhere and the word is a showing now to the people to the church and say watch where that came from he said he came from the Gentiles where did the Gentiles took it from from Nimrod where Nimrod took it from from his father sir the serpent where did the serpent take it from the angel of Light out there in heaven because he wanted to be worshiped it came from somewhere and once you see it in the church then the Lord has said this has to be addressed Jesus said ye shall not be so understand what you're going through I understand you make up yourself Lord who am I because Lord changed me change me change me yeah but what I'm saying as long as there's this unconfessing somewhere that devil has the rightful place to stay there the brother is so blessed they say yes it's not him it's the father he served the Lord the Lord didn't have time to bless the father that's why now he comes to the child so there's also the devil he understood it crosses seed with the woman then comes he comes along to the extent where we see Isaac and Rebecca two faithful child children two wonderful Christians but then out of it comes somebody where did he come from what did Abraham do was it Abraham or was it Sarah who carried that Jinn to be able to be found in a a a ISO the pardon these things striking into the church breaking people apart without even understanding he wanted to propagate his own religion says but the most revealing of of all is that which set forth the the trinitarian concept of God in in Trion form one uh the head of an old man symbolizing God the Father a circle of of which in the Mysteries that signify seed which turns which in turn means the Sun the wings they tell and the dove was the doctrine of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost three person in the godhead they were the the veritable Trinity you can see the same thing in Rome now let me let me ask once again is it not strange that the devil and his worshipers listen to this is it not strange that the devil in his worshipers actually had more truth revealed than the father of Faith Abraham and his descendant it is not strange that the worshipers of Satan knew more about God than the children of God religion to be able to get more to the people just as he did in the Garden of Eden it takes the same word it brings another interpretation to it to bring the people to worship to him right nevertheless in Rome we see that when the Roman came they stood around they saw the word come to them they did not take it as the word quickly Define themselves in the position of no it just can't be one man alone all of us can interpret the word in the way we think because that makes us equal through religion through the word ah brother I don't really think like you know this is really bad I don't really think like you know brother Branham really meant that I don't really think like you know brother Branham really understood what he was talking about I don't really think like you know this year is bad but watch that slowly but surely they're going they're going they're going because when Nimrod started you started like you know hey you know God the father he doesn't really you know talk to God have you heard from God I've been praying like you know I don't get no answer like you know I don't know what's going on let some I know it's like no don't do that ignore him as much as possible brother Branham say ignore him all together in other words it doesn't exist the one that exists is what you see that means I can worship the tree yeah you can worship the tree why because you can see the tree gives you the fruit that you eat you gotta think it don't you see it's the job when you go to school you go you get your your job you get money you have to give yourself more to your job than anything else it was so simple it was not something like you know very strange and very big and very mysterious like you know oh now come and start worshiping me no no very simple who wouldn't want to have a job here we need to have a job but then that same job started taking you slowly but surely away from what you're supposed to worship then you start worshiping your job then you start spending more time with your job then you start taking more time and you don't find the importance of going to church because when you seek the money from your job will pay for your insurance because the money from your job will make you pay for your clothing why am I going to pray why am I going to go to church what is the pastor going to cancel me when I have a philosophy out there who has experience of marriage counseling and all these things box why am I going to sit here and listen to a man who always wants to do things in his own way Jesus says I'm preparing you a kingdom I'm preparing you a kingdom it's not this one here that you're looking at and through the Gentiles Nations all over the world you see the same thing let it be in Africa not even America Let It Be Asia everywhere you go you see this impression the people Nimrod is pulling you need to worship me you need to worship me but it comes in a very humble simple way you look at it it seems very factual according to the research you get this degree you'll make so much money but the same degree doesn't tell you like you know that job takes you away from your place [Music] because God has a place for you a kingdom for you and that's him all this here the devil is going to bring it surely but surely to a place where people will worship it and people will love it so much people will go to places say oh I am I am so grateful I still love and leave I'll look at these people oh my God they really don't have clothing oh my job I really love my boss oh my boss you really give me this night job oh you give me over time I am telling you the worship of nimrod does not strike to the eye he will show up to work every single day but he won't be able to make two service a week you understand where the devil is taking the church that's not happening all day it's happening Among Us and while it's happening Among Us now it requires now Jesus to come along and see The Strife among the people I need to get a job I need to be this I need to be this I need to be respected I need to have a name you understand the language among people you know what's going on in the land you know what's going on in the church I I am a young woman everybody does it what's wrong with it because she wants to be known she wants to have a say in the house but she doesn't understand what is the other Kingdom yet she's only exposed he or she is only exposed to this Kingdom and that's the only thing that comes faster than anything else the child is crying just take the iPad give him start worshiping is watching is watching is watching but then in those cartoons it's shaping the mind of the child it's shaping the mind of the people the watching all type of things brother he eat nothing there's nothing to it yes there's nothing to it but your subconscious is taking those things and it starts shaping you where your behavior to the point you see a woman dressing correctly you you find it indecent for you you'll find it indecent for you to be in prayer and be in church and be among the brothers and God of in fellowship with the brothers and studying the word it becomes strange to you I have this project that I have to work on you know it's going to give me so much money you know like you know actually you know with their website out there they are telling us about what brother really did this and foreign and the pastor also let this type of people on the pulpit brother Branham did mistakes these mistakes now we are now in the time where ourselves now we are able now we are equal we can talk to God oh okay okay until you get in the word you start understanding the other Kingdom the administration of that Kingdom to know who is God who is a prophet who is the what is the body of Jesus Christ until then I just just for tonight just to show you what Nimrod is doing how is coming so close how is gotten so deep in the church I have to work I have to work so hard for my family harder you working and watch the children at home what's what's going on at home she's a he or she five years old yeah you know they're just doing this but then until when they get about 12 years old and they bring a boy at home hey Daddy hey this is my boyfriend then you'll become serious because the makeup of the child is not the makeup of the word because there was nobody at home to teach the child to teach the church about the things that are happening the child that has experience of exp of worshiping Nimrod for 12 years therefore everything he knows it's uh the Kardashians Beyonce Lil diss a little that this guy and you know that that star of the movies all those things that's what the child knows the Bible is this a long time ago this is this this is a new age now this is 2023 now brother you know you know we we the people now do you see where Nimrod is going do you see what Jesus was talking about he said ye shall not be so if we shall not be this what we showed then what shall we be because if he has shown us like you know look at how they're coming about us how Nimrod wants to be worshiped and the Bible the word says he did it shall do it again but then the question is are you going to be partake of that project on which part are you going to stand it because at times our makeup where we came from we have all these things in our back Minds that we don't even understand we ask that leads us to behaving a certain way that surely slowly but surely takes us there stubbornness and all these things I can cover all everything because time is up because we can go in and even see how God brought uh the prophet Ezekiel and to start to show how people got there the stages that they went through for them to become dead to the point they started worshiping tamils and tamus in other places they call him damn who's and them who's is what they used to worship the god of fertility and this God of fertility took the people to a certain extent where even with the songs they were singing brother Branham says treat her like your sister I believe the grown-ups can understand my language kind of languages all kind of things we are married brother we are married we are we are this brother we are this one I'm talking in the church because talking to the church showing what's taking place in the church God took Ezekiel to show him what was taking place in the church Nimrod wants to be worshiped brother said he shall be with but Jesus said ye shall not be so then there's also a place for us to get to because also this Nimrod with whatever he is doing there's a end for it and but believe by God's grace if the Lord gives us is still if we're still alive we're going to get into those places for us to be able to see what is taking place Among Us where we are to set our mind because you say it's an amazing grace that the Lord comes to us and gives us this element for us to be able to see them because he's only talking to a group of people not everybody out there because sermons like this out there you get canceled thank you you can cancel pretty quickly it's Freedom we need Freedom we need Freedom you you don't don't don't be controlling me don't tell me what to do but Jesus was telling the disciples what to do so did it requires in availability from each one of us to be able to receive to look back into our lives not just confessing but to understand our makeup why are we the way we are where we behave the way we behave why is it so hard for us just when I see a situation I have a certain anxiety coming up but you've believed the message amen I believe that but God's grace and I couldn't really get much but by God's grace and will be able to see everything's that that will be able to follow how these are wonderful things and and I said loading foreign I'll just read the last quotation then I'll close the six-fold purpose of Gabrielle visit to Daniel 130 113. now remember when we get in the seals that Antichrist writes out over this those seals Daniel spoke of it here the prince that would come he would be cut off Jesus would would to make reconciliation for the people but that Prince that would stand up that would cause the Abomination to to make desolation that was Rome through Titus and this time it's a prince coming out of Rome will do it and he will be revealed in the last day now listen making himself God going to do word says that is going to happen be of be assured that is going to happen but then at the same time Jesus says ye shall not be so What a Wonderful Grace we have to be able to hear certain things that will help us understand so we do not be stumbled like you know oh I don't like this I don't like that no it's not about you liking or you not liking it's about you knowing and you making the choice shall we pray Heavenly Father I am personally so grateful Lord that the way you brought out these things not much Lord as much was in the notes but we believe that you know how to attend unto your children the way you know what's going on in their lives father as we're looking away unto you we believe that you will bring these things loaded to our remembrance to be able to understand ourselves Lord because Lord when Ruth came into the land she said thy people shall be my people we also want to become that father to be partaker of that Kingdom but the required obedience to everything that Naomi said father as we understand through the word that is going to become and is going to make himself God father I commit myself your children into thy hands Lord remember us we are weak but our strong we also know that at times we can stand and we can look at the situation we think we can handle it but the kindness lord of the devil is so far beyond Lord help us along the way as we look away with Thanksgiving and we ask and we pray if there's anything further that was not said according to Thy Word forgive me Father if love father God I had stumbled or said something Lord that may have hurt your children forgive us Lord but Lord let your father God what you wanted to express to your children to see this pattern of nimrod throughout the entire land may you love me will of Father God be away father because more Revelation makes us Lord aware of what's going on we commit all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen may God bless you to live the way he wants me to live I want to give I until there's yes no more to give [Music] there's just no more love for I could never ever ever [Music] amen what I enjoy about Ministries that God places within the church is they have certain viewpoints they look at it from this angle and from that angle God's got Apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers and each one of them are a very special gift to the church can we say Amen and what I enjoy is a man that goes into the word and sees a pattern as it was so shall it be and he says when you see those fighting among you of the Gentiles that want to be great it shall not be so among you and he says if you want to be great learn to be a servant God teach us the Way Up Is Down [Music] we're not here to build our own kingdom we're to here to get out of this Kingdom into another kingdom a whole nother realm Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world huh I love it he said Nimrod comes in and and introduces culture culture which one of us can say well it is my culture and my country we do it this way so then we can bring our culture right into the message and we defile the message because it's no longer pure it is the American culture as an example American culture that when we have a marriage they go ahead and drink and they have the music and they have the dancing because that's it every culture in America that that's what it's become [Music] and the women dress horrible and everybody drinks and they have that and it's a big party that's culture since when do we allow that culture then to come into our message we're Christians civilization and culture and all of this stuff thank God thank God we had a prophet that would bring us away from culture away from civilization now I'll tell you that quote that was read the worshipers of Satan no huh know more about God than the children of God now how just think on that for just a moment because of intellect and reasoning because that's the channel Satan used for Eve he got her to stop long enough don't you want to be like God he used the channel of reasoning and intellect and he sowed a seed and a cultural seed a civilization seed well I never heard Adam speak like that do you see what I'm seeing that was very good um and then he ends it there which one of you want to be a part of nimrod's project [Music] all right Lord let me be part of your project God you are building a masterpiece huh and God the great sculptor is now finishing the masterpiece but brother Branham said once that Masterpiece when Michelangelo got that that that Masterpiece so like the image he saw in his vision that he stood back and he took the Mallet and he's he hid it on the knee and he says speak because the vision and the sculpture the Masterpiece had become one but brother Branham said the flaw the flaw is what made it the masterpiece I want you to understand the flaw that you have as a human being yet God can sit there and make you into the very image he wants you to be and yet you got a flaw think of that and that's he's telling the ones that have the flaw to speak let that settle and chew on that for tonight as you go to bed say God I don't want to be a part of this project of nimrod God I don't want to be a a modern day Church I want to see the identified Christ all down Through the Ages I want to be a part of the old-time religion I don't want to be a part of this culture of all of this and and knowledge and all of that I want to I I want my knowledge to come from him amen let's Stand Together God bless you I enjoyed that I want to say I enjoyed that yep yeah he's got a whole lot more notes he never even got yeah I know that so I think I have him scheduled June the 7th it's a Wednesday night so he'll continue on that I'm sure but you see now the thing that I enjoy about it brother martin I'm not trying to mold you to preach a certain way God's called you to preach a certain way you preach it as the way God leads you amen and that's what I tell with all of our Ministries that God has got here I'm not trying to uh americanize an African do you understand and I'm not trying to uh uh africanize an American we are what we are brother Bram said now watch when when that bride from every country when she began to March huh she had a certain dress because they came from wherever they had their National Guard okay but what were they marching to the rhythm of the word the pattern of the word you can have a cultural dress according to let's say a certain National Garb but it is the word of God that makes it holy do you understand yeah I don't I'm not going to hold you guys long Wednesday nights are important nights church is more important to you than you realize because if we allow and I I enjoy that pretty soon your business takes you further you're making more money you're more cultural you're more educated you've got a better car you got a bigger house and everything and the kids the next thing you know uh I don't really have to get serious with God until my 12 year old son has a boyfriend did you catch that you wonder how do we get there God opened the Eyes of My Heart Lord give me the isaph the isaf of understanding about this message about spirits about patterns and then we see the pattern as it was so shall it be huh amen amen God bless you all right brother Mark give us a song here that we can sing let's sing Holiness Holiness Holiness is what I long for now Holiness
