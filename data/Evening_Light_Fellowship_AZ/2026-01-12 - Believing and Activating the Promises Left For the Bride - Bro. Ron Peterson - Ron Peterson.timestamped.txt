[30:27] understand it better by
[30:35] the morning [music]
[30:39] of God.
[30:42] We will [music]
[30:47] understand [music]
[30:50] last word and impatience in sin often
[30:55] take us unaware [music] and our hearts
[30:58] are bleless
[31:00] our dear and we want to find when we try
[31:05] to our we will understand it by [music]
[31:09] our Amen.
[31:15] When the morning comes
[31:18] [music]
[31:19] of God together,
[31:25] I'll [music] be over
[31:28] it better. I am.
[31:32] [applause]
[31:32] [music]
[31:34] Oh, he's a good God this morning.
[31:36] Say
[31:38] [singing]
[31:40] I give you thanks for all that [music]
[31:45] you have [singing] done.
[31:48] James
[31:51] so blessed. My soul has found.
[31:55] [music and singing]
[31:55] Oh Lord,
[31:58] I give you thank. Can you praise him
[32:01] this morning? [music]
[32:03] Oh praise.
[32:05] praise. [singing]
[32:07] I give you praise. Amen. [music] All
[32:12] that you
[32:14] know [music]
[32:15] everything you're doing today came so
[32:18] blessed by
[32:24] [music]
[32:27] you. [music] Give the Lord a hand.
[32:33] [applause]
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Thanks for singing for us, James.
[32:36] Brother Willies, if you'll come sing
[32:38] right behind, Brother James. Amen. Our
[32:40] other visitors, we welcome you.
[32:43] Opa's parents, good to have you guys
[32:45] here from Kentucky. Other visitors over
[32:47] here, we welcome you in the name of the
[32:49] Lord. God's good.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Lord bless you, brother James. Brother
[32:54] will be ready to sing behind you,
[32:56] please.
[32:57] Good morning. [music]
[32:59] &gt;&gt; So yesterday
[33:01] we had sitting in the living room and
[33:04] Aaron and I we were had my guitar and we
[33:06] were and I've been singing that song
[33:09] last few weeks. I've never been this
[33:10] homesick before.
[33:13] And uh
[33:15] my wife asked me this morning. She said,
[33:16] "Well, what are you going to sing?" I
[33:17] said, "I'm going to sing I've never been
[33:19] this homesick before." And on the way to
[33:22] church, I was driving along and you
[33:24] know, just thinking about what God
[33:26] brought you through and and I thought,
[33:29] you know what, thought come on heart
[33:30] said, when I get to church, if brother
[33:31] Justin knows the song When God ran,
[33:36] I'm going to do that.
[33:39] And sure enough, I got back in the room,
[33:41] he said, "Sure, I know it." And then,
[33:43] Brother Robert comes up here and sings
[33:45] the chorus. Never been this homesick
[33:47] before. And I said, "Well, Lord, you
[33:49] know what's going on."
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. That's right.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; But I think at one time or another in
[33:55] all of our lives, we have been that
[33:59] prodal in some way or another. Maybe in
[34:01] different depths. Maybe maybe some of us
[34:03] have went further than others, but at
[34:05] one way or another, I think the words of
[34:07] this song may speak to us in many ways.
[34:10] And I was asked some time ago said,
[34:12] "Brother James, how'd you how'd you get
[34:14] back?" back and I [music] said, "Wasn't
[34:16] by myself."
[34:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; If he hadn't run and come and got me, I
[34:23] don't think I could have made it home.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:32] Almighty God,
[34:36] the great I am,
[34:41] unmovable rock, omnipotent, powerful,
[34:46] awesome Lord, [singing]
[34:50] victorious warrior,
[34:54] commanding king of kings, mighty
[34:58] conqueror,
[34:59] And the only time,
[35:04] the only time I ever saw him run
[35:10] was when he ran [singing] to me, took me
[35:14] in his arms, held my head to his chest,
[35:17] said, "My [music] son's come home
[35:19] again." Lifted my face, wiped the
[35:22] [music] tears from my eyes with
[35:25] forgiveness in his voice. He said, "Son,
[35:28] do you know I still love you?"
[35:34] And he caught me by surprise
[35:38] when God ran.
[35:43] The day I left home,
[35:47] I knew I'd broken his heart.
[35:52] And I wondered then if things would ever
[35:56] be the same. Then one night
[36:01] I remembered his love for me.
[36:06] And down that dusty road ahead I could
[36:09] see. It was the only time.
[36:14] It was the only time I ever saw him run.
[36:21] And then he ran to me, took me in his
[36:25] arms, held my head to his chest, said,
[36:28] "My [music] son's [singing] come home
[36:30] again." Lifted my face, wiped the tears
[36:33] from my eyes with forgiveness in his
[36:36] voice. He said, "Son, do you know I
[36:39] still love [singing] you?"
[36:44] He caught me by surprise.
[36:48] He brought me to my knees.
[36:52] When God ran,
[36:56] I saw him run to me. I was so ashamed.
[37:02] All alone and so far away. But now I
[37:07] know that he's been waiting for
[37:10] [singing]
[37:11] this day.
[37:15] ran to me, took me in his arms, held my
[37:19] head to his chest, said, "My [music]
[37:21] son's come [singing] home again." Lifted
[37:24] my face, wiped the tears from my eyes
[37:27] with forgiveness in his voice. He said,
[37:29] "Son, [music and singing] do you know I
[37:32] still love you?"
[37:36] He caught me by surprise
[37:40] when God ran.
[37:43] [singing]
[37:48] [applause and music]
[38:11] And God bless you saints. Praise the
[38:14] Lord. I I um I was also praying trying
[38:17] to find the lead leading of the Lord on
[38:19] what we would sing. So there's many
[38:21] needs amongst us, Brother Robert. Many
[38:23] of us that have healing in our body that
[38:25] we need. There's many of us that have a
[38:26] spiritual need, but I believe that
[38:29] there's a God that can make a way for
[38:31] you this morning. I believe if you're
[38:33] down in the deepest valley, there's a
[38:34] God that can make a way where there
[38:37] seemed there was no way. When a doctor
[38:39] said you could never get out of your
[38:41] condition, there's a God this morning
[38:43] that's the same yesterday, today, and
[38:46] forever for you this morning, his bride.
[38:49] Amen. You can sing [music] this with me
[38:50] this morning. looking for answers.
[38:56] [music]
[38:57] You need a way out.
[39:01] [singing]
[39:02] You've been trapped in that [music]
[39:04] trial,
[39:07] full of sorrow [singing] and doubt.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[39:13] &gt;&gt; You saw a trickle of [singing] sunlight,
[39:19] but [music] you found no escape.
[39:23] But little bride, just hold on to his
[39:26] promises.
[39:30] He said that he'd make a way.
[39:34] [singing and music]
[39:35] Oh, he'll make a way.
[39:42] In the middle of [singing] nowhere,
[39:47] when [music] it seems [singing] no one
[39:49] really cares,
[39:53] but he's [music and singing] there by
[39:54] your side.
[39:57] Oh yes, and he'll make
[39:59] [music and singing] a way.
[40:04] When you feel Satan closing, [singing]
[40:09] don't give up. Don't give in.
[40:13] [singing]
[40:14] He'll make a way right on time.
[40:21] Standing [music] at the Red Sea,
[40:26] there is no place [music and singing] to
[40:28] go.
[40:31] Satan's army, it is closing in
[40:37] and you'll soon [singing] overthrow.
[40:42] But right out of nowhere,
[40:47] there comes [music and singing] a mighty
[40:49] strong hand.
[40:54] He'll roll back your waters. [singing]
[40:59] He'll make a way out again.
[41:04] Oh, he'll make a way
[41:10] in the middle of nowhere. I believe it
[41:14] this morning when it seems no one really
[41:18] cares,
[41:19] [singing]
[41:21] but [music] he's there by your side.
[41:26] Oh, he'll make a way
[41:32] when you feel Satan's closing in.
[41:37] Oh, but don't [singing] give up. Don't
[41:39] [music] give in.
[41:42] He'll make a way right on time. Sing
[41:46] that with me this morning. Oh yes, he'll
[41:49] make [singing] a way
[41:54] in the middle of nowhere in your Red
[41:57] [music] Sea when it seems no one really
[42:02] cares.
[42:04] But he's there by your side. [singing]
[42:10] and he'll make a way [singing]
[42:15] when you [music] feel Satan closing.
[42:20] Oh, no. Don't you give [music] up. Don't
[42:23] give in.
[42:26] He'll make a way right on time.
[42:31] No, don't you give up. Don't [music]
[42:34] give in, [singing] little bride. He'll
[42:37] make a way right on time.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[42:45] [applause]
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for that song special,
[42:52] Brother James, Brother Will. Amen. He
[42:54] does make ways. He's a way maker this
[42:57] morning. He's in the house. Let's stand
[42:59] this morning and change the order of the
[43:00] service.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; He's in the house. He's a way maker.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; You got a need he
[43:06] &gt;&gt; that you'd like him to make a way for?
[43:09] If you do, just lift your hand. Say,
[43:11] "Lord, I got a need. I'm coming to your
[43:12] house."
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this as Brother Ron
[43:15] comes today. Amen. Let's sing verse one
[43:18] and let's start there. He's in the
[43:20] house.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; The little girl [singing] was lying
[43:27] there. The people over
[43:33] they just laughed at Jesus
[43:34] [music and singing]
[43:35] when she said she's only sleeping.
[43:41] [music]
[43:42] As he took her by the [singing] hand,
[43:46] she began [music] to live again.
[43:51] Some began to praise [music and singing]
[43:53] the Lord.
[43:55] Some begin to say
[43:59] [music and singing]
[44:04] there.
[44:07] [music and singing] Now there is
[44:12] darkness. [music]
[44:16] Now [singing] there is hope. [music]
[44:20] There's no more now. [singing]
[44:24] I will praise his [music] name.
[44:27] [singing]
[44:29] Praise his name.
[44:33] He's his.
[44:35] [music]
[44:39] Oh, we [singing] were like that little
[44:42] girl [music]
[44:44] in all our sin.
[44:48] But Jesus [music]
[44:49] is his [singing] heart of mine and he
[44:52] gave me life again.
[44:57] I am just a house of [singing and music]
[45:01] whoever sins that blessed day.
[45:05] There's a light that [music and singing]
[45:06] shines on him all the world to see.
[45:13] He's in the night [music]
[45:18] to
[45:20] [singing]
[45:22] there is [music] light where
[45:25] darkness
[45:27] to me. [music]
[45:29] Oh,
[45:34] [singing] there go. [music]
[45:36] I will praise [singing] him.
[45:42] Praise [music] him. Praise his name.
[45:48] [music]
[45:50] Come on now. Praise. Praise his name.
[45:54] I will praise
[45:56] his name.
[45:58] Oh, [music] praise his [singing] name.
[46:03] He's in [music] the house.
[46:07] [singing]
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:11] [applause]
[46:13] [music]
[46:17] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; He's in the house.
[46:21] Wherever he's at,
[46:27] &gt;&gt; he brings his promises to pass.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; If you have a need,
[46:35] &gt;&gt; you say, "Lord, remember me this
[46:37] morning." Would you lift that hand
[46:39] before him?
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "It takes faith to
[46:45] activate God."
[46:47] &gt;&gt; So that's what we're doing. We're
[46:49] lifting our hands. for saying, "Lord, we
[46:52] can't do it on our own."
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; We need your help. Heavenly Father, as
[46:57] we've raised our petitions, our hands,
[47:00] our needs, [music] whether they are
[47:03] written or unspoken,
[47:06] Father, you know every need, and you're
[47:10] a God that meets every need. You said,
[47:12] "I will be with you, even in you until
[47:15] the end of the world. Cast all your
[47:17] cares upon me because I
[47:21] &gt;&gt; care for you. You are a high priest that
[47:23] can be touched.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Let faith reach out and touch you.
[47:34] Let each one
[47:36] &gt;&gt; become energized and quickened by the
[47:38] Holy Spirit
[47:40] &gt;&gt; that you might work your work of grace
[47:42] in our lives and manifest your life
[47:45] [music]
[47:46] inside of us. Father, it's no longer I
[47:49] that live, but Christ that liveth in me.
[47:51] And the life that I now live, I live by
[47:54] the faith of the Son of God, which gave
[47:57] himself for us. Thank you for Calvary.
[48:00] Thank you for the resurrection. Thank
[48:02] you, Father, for your blood. Thank you
[48:05] for your word. I pray now that you will
[48:08] bless each and everyone, each one that
[48:11] is here. May you grant to them a great
[48:14] victory. I ask in Jesus Christ's name.
[48:18] Amen.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Amen. God bless you. Let's
[48:23] just remain standing. Thank you
[48:25] musicians. I appreciate it each and
[48:28] everyone. song specials. They're always
[48:31] very, very special. Amen. God puts it on
[48:34] the heart of someone to sing a song
[48:37] special. Sometimes people get a word
[48:39] from a song special.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes people receive something
[48:44] because somebody was led of the Lord to
[48:47] sing a song.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; So that's what we do. You just feel led.
[48:51] So as God leads you, what happens? You
[48:55] don't realize there's somebody that had
[48:58] a need and they're calling on God and
[49:01] God puts it on your heart and so you
[49:03] sing the song and God gives them what
[49:05] they have need of.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; You might already be healed. You might
[49:08] already be delivered. There might be
[49:10] because he sent his word and his word
[49:14] heals and delivers the people. Amen.
[49:16] Amen. God bless you all this morning and
[49:19] welcome all of our visitors each and
[49:20] every one. and I am not going to take
[49:22] the time for fear that I might miss
[49:25] someone also. But you know who you are
[49:27] and we welcome you in the name of the
[49:28] Lord. But to our local group, we say God
[49:31] bless you to our faithfuls here. Um we
[49:35] greatly appreciate you.
[49:38] I want to just say as I get into this
[49:41] service this morning, okay, I've been
[49:44] very very quickened in the last several
[49:47] weeks to understand the day in the hour
[49:50] in which we live that we might activate
[49:53] the promises for this hour.
[49:57] Okay? Because that's our inheritance.
[50:00] But it's got to be done by faith. And
[50:02] faith is a revelation. And God reveals
[50:04] to you. Brother Brandham said, "The
[50:06] bride
[50:08] will catch the revelation of the rapture
[50:11] &gt;&gt; because it's a revelation to her."
[50:13] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that?
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you believe that this
[50:17] revelation is ongoing?
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; And that you come up to one place, but
[50:25] then God draws you higher. And I believe
[50:28] right now and I I I will say this and
[50:31] make it very well known to you
[50:36] that the bride has come to a turning
[50:39] point.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; You see years ago we we we preached and
[50:47] we would talk about Malachi 4.
[50:50] Hallelujah. Praise God. We talk about
[50:53] Revelation chapter 10. Amen. and the
[50:55] angel and all of this. Well, for years
[51:00] that got the people rejoicing because we
[51:03] recognize that God sent a prophet.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; But the time has come to go beyond
[51:11] &gt;&gt; recognizing the prophet to recognizing
[51:14] his message.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Because praise God, God sent a sign. But
[51:21] what did the sign say?
[51:25] What is happening
[51:27] &gt;&gt; to us?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; What's going on right now? I want to
[51:31] know the promises for this hour
[51:35] &gt;&gt; that it might be quickened to me that I
[51:38] might know my position because if I know
[51:40] my position, I have power and authority
[51:42] with God.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Very good. And I am doing the very best
[51:50] that I can to endeavor to keep the peace
[51:56] of the unity of the spirit.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; That's not easy at times,
[52:02] especially with siblings.
[52:06] I'm talking to the family of God
[52:10] because sometimes you have sibling
[52:12] rivalry. It just happens. All of you
[52:15] that have children, they all come from
[52:17] the same mom and dad, but for some
[52:19] reason, you know, they they sit close
[52:21] and went, "Don't touch me.
[52:24] Leave me alone, Mom. He did it. He
[52:27] touched me." See, and and you got little
[52:29] things. And there are sometimes you have
[52:31] little issues with people
[52:34] and you know, you don't maybe not get
[52:36] along. Well, uh, understand that, uh,
[52:41] when you have the spirit of Christ,
[52:44] okay, uh, you learn to get along.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; What if the one that you have had an
[52:51] issue with for years is the one his
[52:53] mansion is next to you in glory?
[52:57] &gt;&gt; You going to build a bigger fence?
[53:00] You going to put curtains on your house
[53:02] so you can't look into his?
[53:05] Hey, I believe saints of God that we
[53:08] have come to a turning point. I believe
[53:11] that the bride right now and understand
[53:13] this is not something exclusive to
[53:16] evening light fellowship.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; It is not something that is just
[53:20] happening here and we're we're we're
[53:23] saying that we have it and others are
[53:25] missing it. No, I'm saying that the
[53:27] bride of Jesus Christ is coming into an
[53:31] understanding.
[53:32] Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; She is being quickened at this very
[53:36] moment.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; And it's not an orchestration of man. It
[53:41] is not coming to us by carnal knowledge
[53:44] and carnal understanding.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; But we are coming into a higher
[53:49] dimension.
[53:51] And the Lord willing, I will probably
[53:53] preach that here in the next service or
[53:56] two when I I speak is I want to I want
[54:00] to make you acutely aware
[54:04] of another dimension.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:10] I want you to aware that there is
[54:13] another reality that is far greater
[54:16] &gt;&gt; in the unseen realm
[54:18] &gt;&gt; than what you see with your eye.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; So let's not be carnally minded and just
[54:25] get our blinders on and it's it it it's
[54:28] just this. But may God open the eyes of
[54:34] our understanding
[54:36] &gt;&gt; that we might know him. Yes. Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:42] Praise the Lord. All right,
[54:45] let's just remain standing. Turn with me
[54:47] in your Bibles. It's probably one of the
[54:49] most familiar portions of scripture, but
[54:52] I wish to launch off. I'm going to take
[54:55] something in a little bit of a different
[54:57] direction. So, please bear with me this
[54:59] morning. Revelation chap 10. Revelation
[55:03] 10
[55:05] verses 1- 11. [snorts]
[55:09] Hallelujah. I love to hear the Bibles
[55:11] being turned. Amen. I trust that this is
[55:16] not the only time you open it.
[55:20] I trust that you open it daily,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; that you pray daily,
[55:27] &gt;&gt; that you seek his face. Because if you
[55:30] will make a move towards God, God will
[55:32] make a move towards you.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's you yielding
[55:39] and you getting into it so that God can
[55:43] give you more.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Revelation
[55:47] chap 10
[55:52] verses 1- 11.
[55:58] Now this is the prophetic word.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; This is a prophecy
[56:06] that was inspired by John or inspired by
[56:10] God to John
[56:13] and he wrote it. And this has
[56:18] has gone down through the ages.
[56:19] Different ones in different ages read
[56:23] this very same scripture and had no idea
[56:27] of when it would be fulfilled.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; So God has a time and a season for
[56:33] everything.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; And so we must be aware of the time and
[56:39] the season. So brother Brandham preaches
[56:42] to us sermons that declare to us
[56:46] something to to let us know where we're
[56:48] at.
[56:50] And the sermon that just a few weeks ago
[56:53] was just so dynamic to me was the
[56:57] uniting time and sign.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; He actually says this will be the end
[57:04] time seed
[57:07] &gt;&gt; sign.
[57:13] Revelation chap 10
[57:17] verse 1.
[57:19] And I saw another mighty angel
[57:23] come down from heaven
[57:26] clothed with a cloud.
[57:31] And a rainbow was upon his head, and his
[57:33] face was as it were the sun,
[57:37] and his feet as pillars of fire.
[57:42] And he had in his hand a little book
[57:45] book open.
[57:48] Notice the book is open. In Revelation
[57:51] chapter 5, there was no one worthy
[57:56] to take the book, neither to look
[57:58] thereon.
[58:00] And John wept.
[58:06] He said, "Weep not, John."
[58:09] &gt;&gt; For the lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[58:11] prevailed.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that when he
[58:16] heard that the lion had prevailed, he
[58:19] turned to look and what did he see?
[58:22] &gt;&gt; I saw a lamb.
[58:26] He saw God's provided way. He saw a
[58:30] lamb, the same one that Abel saw.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; The revelation keeps growing.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; God, help us to see the lamb. [snorts]
[58:45] And he had in his hand a little book
[58:47] open, and he set his right foot upon the
[58:49] sea, and his left foot on the earth, and
[58:53] cried with a loud voice, as when a lion
[58:56] roarth.
[58:58] And when he had cried, seven thunders
[59:01] uttered their voices.
[59:05] And when the seven thunders had uttered
[59:07] their voices, I was about to write. And
[59:09] I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[59:11] me, "Seal up those things which the
[59:13] seven thunders uttered, and write them
[59:16] not." John could not write it. Why? It
[59:19] wasn't his time.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; But it is our time.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[59:28] That's why brother Brennham said
[59:31] Revelations
[59:32] 10 1-7
[59:34] is the seventh seal.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; It's the mystery
[59:40] &gt;&gt; that's been hid down through the ages
[59:42] but is now revealed.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; So we understand that the seventh seal
[59:48] finishes all things.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; It's the end of the struggling world.
[59:52] It's the end of everything.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're at the end.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; This whole world is falling apart. It's
[1:00:04] got to fall apart.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we have a kingdom which
[1:00:09] cannot fall apart, which cannot be
[1:00:12] shook. And so therefore, that kingdom is
[1:00:15] coming and pressing.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; It's pressing
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; to get this kingdom out of the way that
[1:00:21] the other kingdom
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; can come. I say come quickly.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; So it was sealed up then
[1:00:36] because it wasn't time. Verse five. And
[1:00:40] the angel which I saw stand upon the sea
[1:00:43] and upon the earth lifted up his hand to
[1:00:45] heaven
[1:00:47] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:00:49] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:00:51] that therein are and the earth and the
[1:00:54] things that therein are and the sea and
[1:00:56] the things which are therein that there
[1:00:59] should be time no longer.
[1:01:03] They asked brother Brennham when you
[1:01:05] opened the seals did it end time? He
[1:01:08] said no time. He says still goes on.
[1:01:12] When it means that time shall be no
[1:01:14] longer. It actually if you go to the
[1:01:17] true translation it said no longer
[1:01:19] delayed.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; As a woman that comes to the time of
[1:01:26] giving birth
[1:01:29] when she gets into her position
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; and she's under birth pains. Let me tell
[1:01:37] you the time can be you can say wait
[1:01:44] when she's ready to give birth
[1:01:49] nothing is more important
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; the time can be no longer delayed
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; get out of the way
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; it's coming
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; you
[1:02:08] But in the days
[1:02:11] of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:02:15] when he shall begin to sound,
[1:02:19] the mystery of God should be finished,
[1:02:21] as he hath declared to his servants the
[1:02:24] prophets.
[1:02:26] Notice in the days of the voice of the
[1:02:29] seventh angel when he should begin to
[1:02:31] sound. And brother Brennham said not
[1:02:34] when he begins
[1:02:37] in his first and second pull but when he
[1:02:40] begins to reveal the word
[1:02:44] and his ministry changes.
[1:02:46] How many of you have caught the change
[1:02:49] of ministry? That's right.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; You you you've understand that the the
[1:02:54] orchestra has gone an octave higher
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; that something has happened.
[1:03:02] You see, we're being quickened now
[1:03:06] beyond just being to say the seventh
[1:03:09] angel has sounded wonderful. But what
[1:03:13] was that sounding do?
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; What will it produce?
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; What effect will it have? Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; God, help me to hear
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; what the spirit
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; is saying unto the church.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And the mystery of God should be
[1:03:32] finished,
[1:03:35] as he hath declared to his servants, the
[1:03:37] prophets.
[1:03:38] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:03:40] spake unto me again, and said, "Go, take
[1:03:44] the little book which is open in the
[1:03:46] hand of the angel, which standeth upon
[1:03:48] the sea, and upon the earth."
[1:03:53] And I went to the angel, said, "Give me
[1:03:55] the little book."
[1:03:58] This was not
[1:04:01] a polite suggestion.
[1:04:05] [snorts]
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; It was a command.
[1:04:08] Give me
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; the little book.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "You just don't
[1:04:17] ask." Oh, um, Satan, listen. Uh, you
[1:04:21] know, you got some inheritance in mind.
[1:04:22] I want you to give it to me.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; No, he said, "You're going to have to
[1:04:28] fight for it." And he said, "You're
[1:04:29] going to have to demand
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; that he release it, and you have to
[1:04:35] claim it and embrace it
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; that it's yours."
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; How many of you want your inheritance?
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Give me the little book. And he said
[1:04:50] unto me. So now, one angel speaking to
[1:04:53] an earthly angel.
[1:04:55] Give me the little book. and he said
[1:04:58] unto me, "Take it and eat it up." So
[1:05:01] now, as he's given the book, he's given
[1:05:04] instruction.
[1:05:07] Take it
[1:05:09] and put it on your shelf.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Just put it in your library.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "Take it
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; and eat it up.
[1:05:30] and it shall make thy belly bitter, but
[1:05:32] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[1:05:36] And I took the little book out of the
[1:05:38] angel's hand. So now watch this very
[1:05:43] closely. Now
[1:05:45] the angel says, "Take the little book
[1:05:48] and eat it."
[1:05:51] John then had to go and physically take
[1:05:55] it.
[1:05:58] You have a responsibility with this
[1:06:01] message that has been given to you in
[1:06:04] this hour.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Don't accumulate it.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Eat it.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Take it. Say it's mine.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Then I took the little book out of the
[1:06:25] angel's hand and ate it up, and it was
[1:06:28] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[1:06:30] as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[1:06:35] And he said unto me,
[1:06:38] "Thou must prophesy
[1:06:41] [snorts] again before many peoples,
[1:06:44] nations,
[1:06:46] tongues,
[1:06:48] and kings."
[1:06:50] I want you to be aware of who is
[1:06:54] speaking
[1:06:56] and what voice is quickening the other
[1:07:00] one to take and to eat.
[1:07:06] And so we see the mighty angel coming
[1:07:09] down from heaven. He's a heavenly angel.
[1:07:11] Who is that? That's Jesus Christ.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; He's coming to an angel messenger.
[1:07:17] Messenger is also an angel
[1:07:20] here. One who receives a message
[1:07:25] and he says take the book.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Now understand the voice is giving
[1:07:31] instruction.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Can you receive instruction this
[1:07:38] morning?
[1:07:40] Because it's not just taking it, but
[1:07:42] taking it and eating it because it's now
[1:07:45] going to create in the ministry
[1:07:49] of the final voice.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; John being a type of the bride of
[1:07:55] Christ,
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; take it, eat it, because thou
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; must prophesy.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; You say, well, I thought that's just the
[1:08:05] prophet of the hour. I will give you a
[1:08:07] quote. The prophet of God said, "The
[1:08:09] prophet of every hour is the Holy
[1:08:12] Spirit."
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'll ride the trail
[1:08:18] one more time." It's a promise.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Can you receive that?
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; I believe what God is doing.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; He's riding the trail again.
[1:08:34] Yet he's immorpha.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; He's changing his mask.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; He went from a one prophet messenger
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; to a mystical body to a multi-membered
[1:08:50] body.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; That they would come from here and
[1:08:54] there. They would come from all kinds of
[1:08:56] backgrounds. That's right.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; You would have all kinds of things in
[1:09:01] your life and wonder, "How did you get
[1:09:03] where you're at today? How is it that
[1:09:06] you received it?" Let me tell you, God
[1:09:09] is determined to save you.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; You did not go hunting for this message.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; He came hunting for you.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; He ran to you.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, now in the name of
[1:09:31] Jesus Christ, I ask a great anointing be
[1:09:34] upon us, not only on the speaker, but
[1:09:37] upon every hearer, quicken us, Father,
[1:09:39] under the promises for this hour that we
[1:09:42] might take our position
[1:09:44] that we might have power and authority
[1:09:46] with God. I ask it for your glory in
[1:09:48] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. being seated
[1:09:55] in the presence of God.
[1:10:02] The voice
[1:10:04] continues,
[1:10:08] "Eating the revealed open book
[1:10:13] caused the quickening power."
[1:10:17] John was quickened by what he was
[1:10:19] eating.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; And I want to
[1:10:23] declare unto you that if you say you're
[1:10:26] eating of this message,
[1:10:30] I want to ask,
[1:10:32] are you being quickened to it?
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Is your understanding greater now than
[1:10:41] when it first come to you? Is it
[1:10:43] unfolding?
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "Watch this
[1:10:47] unfolding." Because what God has done in
[1:10:50] every age, he said, "Don't put a period
[1:10:53] and stop there." Because God wants to
[1:10:55] add under your faith. Virtue, virtue,
[1:10:58] knowledge, knowledge, temperance.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; It's continuing. Let me tell you, it's
[1:11:03] continuing. Now,
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; the voice of God did not stop with the
[1:11:07] death of the seventh angel messenger.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan says, "You can silence
[1:11:13] the messenger. You can put him in the
[1:11:15] grave, but the voice continues.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen to that? It
[1:11:21] continues. You know where it continues?
[1:11:24] In me
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; and in you.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the very same voice that
[1:11:29] was in him
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; is now in you.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; The very mystery
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; of Christ himself
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; is now being unveiled. Listen, it took
[1:11:42] the seventh angel
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; in this hour to find a bride.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it was his ministry that
[1:11:53] unveiled her.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; It was his ministry that unveiled you.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; And then you realized
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; what God was doing with that seventh
[1:12:05] angel is he was choosing a bride.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] That's why you took it so personal.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; It must be personal.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Don't you dare pass it off to someone
[1:12:20] else.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Don't be foolish.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; That angel
[1:12:29] is powerless to bring you to a position
[1:12:33] of authority until you embrace the
[1:12:36] promise and you agree with his message.
[1:12:39] Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And when you do,
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; there's a quickening power. When Mary
[1:12:44] said, "Be it unto me according to thy
[1:12:47] word."
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; The angel then could leave. I've done my
[1:12:51] job.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Malachi 4 could not go
[1:12:56] off of the scene until he had done his
[1:12:59] job.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:15] John was changing dimensions.
[1:13:20] Immediately when John was quickened by
[1:13:24] the Holy Spirit,
[1:13:26] come up hither.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; He w he he was to transition from where
[1:13:33] he was to a higher dimension. Brother
[1:13:37] Brennham said, "Revelation
[1:13:39] is actually a transitioning power.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; It's taking you from where you are
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; to where you want to be.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; So, it's continuing.
[1:13:56] This
[1:13:58] mystery
[1:14:02] is being unveiled
[1:14:05] and you're a part of it.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; The bride is becoming
[1:14:14] unveiled.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And you've all been to the weddings with
[1:14:19] the bride and here she comes ushered in.
[1:14:22] Let me tell you, the wedding is not
[1:14:25] about the bridegroom.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; They don't all stand when he comes in.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Because he chose a woman.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; And because of that choosing and because
[1:14:40] of her acceptance,
[1:14:43] now there's a union taking place.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; And she was being ushered in. And as
[1:14:49] she's ushered in,
[1:14:53] The family recognizes there's a changing
[1:14:57] taking place. A union is about to take
[1:14:59] place. And the mother stands and turns
[1:15:02] and look
[1:15:06] the crescendo.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Here comes the bride.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; She's being ushered in
[1:15:16] by the father.
[1:15:21] This ushering in takes some time.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; It's her day.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; It's her hour.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; This is all about her.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Who giveth this woman
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; to be married to this man? Who allows
[1:15:39] this union?
[1:15:43] gives her away
[1:15:49] and then
[1:15:55] he is the only one that removes the
[1:15:58] veil.
[1:15:59] And he doesn't just take it here and
[1:16:01] just
[1:16:02] flippantly.
[1:16:05] No,
[1:16:07] he takes it just like we saw in the last
[1:16:10] in December. We had two weddings.
[1:16:13] But you see, I love to see when he takes
[1:16:15] it and he does it slowly
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; like this and she every time he takes it
[1:16:20] higher, she gets a a greater smile.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; There's an expectation.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[1:16:32] The groom
[1:16:34] unveils the bride.
[1:16:38] It wasn't Malachi 4.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; He's just the vessel.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; He's only the voice.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; But the unveiling was being done by God
[1:16:50] himself.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; And it's still going on right now.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Because until that last one comes in and
[1:16:58] recognizes who she is,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. We're in that season.
[1:17:07] Revelation is the power of
[1:17:09] transformation.
[1:17:11] We walk not by faith but by sight.
[1:17:15] Excuse me. We walk not by sight but by
[1:17:18] faith. It's not what you seek. Too much
[1:17:21] of the time we are hindered from seeing
[1:17:24] what God is doing with carnal eyes.
[1:17:28] Revelation therefore then is coming to a
[1:17:32] higher dimension.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; It will require
[1:17:38] supernatural instruction.
[1:17:40] Not comparing verse verse. That's good.
[1:17:43] That's nice.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; But for you to be able to actually be
[1:17:48] quickened
[1:17:50] to the place
[1:17:52] where you receive supernatural
[1:17:55] instruction. [snorts]
[1:17:57] I want to title my sermon this morning
[1:18:02] and and and and follow along with me
[1:18:04] because I I've got many pages of notes,
[1:18:09] but I don't want to be in a hurry
[1:18:12] believing and activating the promises
[1:18:16] left for the bride.
[1:18:20] I want to know
[1:18:22] what is left and expected for the bride
[1:18:26] to fulfill.
[1:18:29] I don't want to take the subject of say
[1:18:33] what the word says
[1:18:36] and say what the tapes
[1:18:39] say.
[1:18:44] There is to be a ministry of the bride
[1:18:47] in this end time. And to deny her her
[1:18:51] ministry is to deny the word.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together on that?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; It is to not just press play.
[1:19:07] It is to press play and obey.
[1:19:11] Say what the tapes say.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Don't just take isolated quotes and
[1:19:19] stop.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Keep going.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Why? It's still unfolding.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; The end time seed sign has been
[1:19:30] recognized by the bride
[1:19:33] and the prophet was the sign to bring
[1:19:36] about a union with the groom. Ezar never
[1:19:40] courted Rebecca.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't expect her to fall in love
[1:19:48] with him.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; But his message was, I'm bringing you to
[1:19:52] the one. I'm just a messenger.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing you to him. How many of you
[1:20:00] believe that this prophet messenger is
[1:20:03] bringing you to the groom?
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; That's him. That was his job.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Not for you to fall in love with him.
[1:20:11] Not to for you to just get enamored and
[1:20:13] everything by the messenger. Brother
[1:20:15] Brham said, "I'm just a voice."
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; I'm just an instrument being used of
[1:20:21] God.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; We have recognized the Elijah ministry
[1:20:28] for our day and he and he alone. Now, I
[1:20:32] want to make this extremely clear.
[1:20:35] I believe that there is but one voice
[1:20:39] that God has ordained to turn our hearts
[1:20:42] back
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; and that was through the ministry of the
[1:20:47] seventh angel messenger. How many of you
[1:20:49] know that's what I preach and I teach?
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; We do not replace him.
[1:21:00] We do not say, "Well, that's over.
[1:21:03] That's done with." No, it continues.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; It's an ongoing message.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brennham is a typologist
[1:21:17] and he says, "I look for patterns within
[1:21:20] the word." And he says, "Therefore, I
[1:21:23] look and see what has been will show me
[1:21:27] what will be.
[1:21:29] For as it was, so shall it be."
[1:21:34] Because God doesn't change his pattern.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Watch in sian church age. In every age,
[1:21:40] we have exactly the same pattern.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Every age. That includes this last one.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; That is why the light comes through some
[1:21:50] God-given messenger in a certain area.
[1:21:54] And then from that messenger, there
[1:21:56] spreads the light through the ministry
[1:21:58] of others.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:01] Not just him.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; There is a God-given voice. There is a
[1:22:07] God-given messenger.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And through that messenger, there are
[1:22:11] others
[1:22:13] who have been faithfully taught.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; But of course, all those who go out
[1:22:19] don't always learn how necessary it is
[1:22:21] to speak only what the messenger has
[1:22:24] spoken. I'm not interested in men's
[1:22:26] opinions. I'm not interested in
[1:22:29] interpretations.
[1:22:30] God is his own interpreter. If there is
[1:22:33] a mystery and you don't have the answer,
[1:22:36] don't try to figure it out. Let it be.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; God brings it to pass.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; And that is the interpretation.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Let there be light and
[1:22:46] there was light." That was the
[1:22:48] interpretation.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Behold, a virgin shall
[1:22:51] conceive and she conceived." That was
[1:22:53] the interpretation.
[1:23:00] How careful we must be to hear one
[1:23:03] voice. For the spirit has but one voice,
[1:23:06] which is the voice of God. Paul warned
[1:23:09] them to say what he said, even as Peter
[1:23:12] did. Likewise, he warned them that even
[1:23:15] he Paul could not change one word of
[1:23:18] what was given by revelation. Oh, how
[1:23:20] important it is to hear the voice of God
[1:23:23] by way of his messengers
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; and then
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; watch this. And then say what has been
[1:23:32] given them to say to the churches.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Do you see it continues? It's not just
[1:23:38] that messenger,
[1:23:41] but it is now continuing
[1:23:47] to from those that have been faithfully
[1:23:49] taught.
[1:23:52] Now hold on because I want to bring
[1:23:54] something to your attenu your
[1:23:58] attention
[1:24:00] because much of the time this quote has
[1:24:04] been misused and abused among message
[1:24:08] ministry.
[1:24:10] Revelation of Jesus Christ church age
[1:24:13] book. Now remember this. Christ in the
[1:24:17] true church is a continuation of the
[1:24:20] book of acts. But the book of revelation
[1:24:23] shows that how that the antichrist
[1:24:26] spirit would come into the church and
[1:24:28] defile it making it lukewarm,
[1:24:33] formal and powerless. that exposes
[1:24:37] Satan,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; revealing his works, attempting
[1:24:40] destruction of God's people, and the
[1:24:43] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:24:46] the time he's cast into the lake of
[1:24:48] fire. He fights that, he cannot stand
[1:24:51] it. He knows that if the people get the
[1:24:54] true revelation, now this was
[1:24:56] capitalized by brother Brenam. You'll
[1:24:58] find it in your church age book.
[1:25:01] He knows that if the people get the true
[1:25:03] revelation of the true church, so that
[1:25:06] means that there is a true revelation
[1:25:08] and a false revelation and that there is
[1:25:11] a true church and there is a false
[1:25:13] church.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; So when the true church catches the true
[1:25:17] revelation
[1:25:20] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:25:23] and she can do the greater work. Listen,
[1:25:26] don't leave it alone with the ministry
[1:25:29] of the seventh angel.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, the ministry ceased. When he
[1:25:36] went off the scene, that's it.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; No, it continues.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; And she can do the greater works. She
[1:25:46] will be an invincible army.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; We hear that all the time. Praise God. I
[1:25:51] tell you, no devil will stand before
[1:25:53] you. Why? you know, on and on and she's
[1:25:56] going to be an invincible army. But now
[1:25:59] watch this disclosure here in the next
[1:26:01] sentence.
[1:26:04] If they get the true the true revelation
[1:26:07] of the two spirits within the framework
[1:26:09] of the Christian church. In other words,
[1:26:11] it's coming within the message.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Deception is not coming from out there.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Deception within the message.
[1:26:27] I've showed you quotes where he said
[1:26:28] that the bride would be doing deceiving
[1:26:32] by the word. And what he means by that,
[1:26:35] okay, is that by her interpretation
[1:26:40] of what he said will deceive the people.
[1:26:43] Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; So, be careful who's preaching to you
[1:26:48] and what they're saying because if
[1:26:50] they're not saying what the Bible says
[1:26:52] or if they're not saying what the
[1:26:54] message says because the message,
[1:26:56] understand this,
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; the message is the clarification of the
[1:27:02] word.
[1:27:04] The message is the revealing of the word
[1:27:08] because the letter in itself
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; is dead
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; but the quickening of the spirit brings
[1:27:17] it life.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; He says and by God's spirit discern and
[1:27:27] withstand.
[1:27:30] Now there's two spirits within
[1:27:33] the framework of the church.
[1:27:37] And he says, "And by God's spirit, you
[1:27:41] discern and withstand." Those are two
[1:27:43] actions. You first have to discern it.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And then you have to withstand it.
[1:27:52] It's an antichrist spirit. What does
[1:27:54] Antichrist mean?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Anti-word. Brother Brandham says, oh, he
[1:28:00] says, sometimes you think anti-word or
[1:28:02] antichrist is going to be so obvious. He
[1:28:06] said, no, it's just a changing of one
[1:28:08] word.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; He said the spirit would be so close in
[1:28:14] the end time, it would deceive the very
[1:28:18] elect if it were possible.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; But he said the reason it's not possible
[1:28:22] is because the word of God has become
[1:28:25] the bride's absolute.
[1:28:32] He said, "Then Satan will be powerless
[1:28:34] before."
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Let me declare something to you this
[1:28:40] morning. We have entered into,
[1:28:43] and brother Brennan declared it, the
[1:28:45] time of the finished cycle.
[1:28:48] In other words, everything is going
[1:28:50] through cycles. There was a cycle of
[1:28:52] Revelations 10:1, the cycle of the
[1:28:56] ministry. It was going forth. Brother
[1:28:59] Bren, let me tell you, brother Brennham
[1:29:01] was pointing people to go to church. And
[1:29:04] he said, "The closest ones that I can
[1:29:06] send you to now are Pentecostals because
[1:29:09] they believe in the supernatural." But
[1:29:12] when brother Brandon was declaring, hey,
[1:29:14] I I've sent 750,000 of my converts to
[1:29:18] assemblies of God,
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; that's what he said. But back then,
[1:29:23] there were no message churches.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; You have to understand there was no
[1:29:29] evening light fellowship. There was no
[1:29:31] end time tabernacle. There was none of
[1:29:34] there was a few inspired men catching
[1:29:39] that this ministry was unique.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; There weren't message churches.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; He was sending go to church.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, keep going to church
[1:29:52] because he knew there would come a time
[1:29:55] when you needed to be in church.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; You may not even have been called
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; at that time. You might not even have
[1:30:03] heard about it,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; but it never negates going to church.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Listening to tapes does not replace
[1:30:13] going to church.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Although I believe in listening to
[1:30:23] tapes,
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; I try to every day
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; and I've done it ever since I was a
[1:30:30] young man. Since I came into this
[1:30:32] message,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; it's just continually unfolding.
[1:30:40] I was in my office in prayer and study
[1:30:44] and I heard my wife in the kitchen
[1:30:50] and she's preparing some food
[1:30:54] and the voice
[1:30:57] that familiar voice
[1:31:00] was speaking
[1:31:02] and I came I walked in I said how
[1:31:06] beautiful is that voice
[1:31:08] There's how many of you can say there's
[1:31:10] something
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; about that voice
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; because in the days of the voice
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; you see everything that God did from
[1:31:20] Genesis 1 he created with his voice.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; He said let there be light and he spoke
[1:31:26] it with his voice and when he did that
[1:31:28] voice created. I want you to understand
[1:31:31] the voice has a quickening power. The
[1:31:33] voice is creative. Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said through the spoken
[1:31:37] word of the original seed, he says, "God
[1:31:40] is creating himself a bride." How did he
[1:31:44] do it? By speaking the word.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And the prophet was catching revelation.
[1:31:49] I'll tell you what, I'm here to preach a
[1:31:51] sermon today about choosing a bride.
[1:31:55] And what was he doing? He was he was
[1:31:57] creating
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; the virtues
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; and the characteristics what God would
[1:32:06] look for in a bride.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Not through beauty.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Not through Hollywood evangelism.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; He says this little bride, if I can get
[1:32:22] her to stand still long enough.
[1:32:25] Okay, Pentecost was to get everybody
[1:32:28] excited and everything. He said, "Now,
[1:32:29] now he's here now. Sit still.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; It's not all this jumping and shouting.
[1:32:36] Although we believe in jumping and
[1:32:37] shouting,
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; but give me something to jump and shout
[1:32:40] about."
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Pentecost got it all reversed. Well,
[1:32:44] because we jumped and shout, therefore,
[1:32:46] we got it. No.
[1:32:49] Because many times God will say, "Be
[1:32:52] still
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; and know that I am God."
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; God had been speaking to Abraham for
[1:33:04] many ages. You're going to have a son.
[1:33:06] You're going to bring forth a promised
[1:33:08] seed.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And God kept appearing to Abraham. And
[1:33:12] God appears to Abraham and and he does
[1:33:15] this. And God appears. And we keep
[1:33:17] seeing the appearing. And yet there's
[1:33:19] nothing being appeared unto Sarah.
[1:33:24] She's just along for the ride.
[1:33:28] She is a recipient of what God is
[1:33:31] promising to her husband.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand the
[1:33:35] declaration came to Abraham. You're
[1:33:38] going to have a seed. He can't do it by
[1:33:42] himself.
[1:33:46] So, how's that seed going to come?
[1:33:49] Through his wife Sarah. But Sarah has
[1:33:53] got to be quickened according to Genesis
[1:33:56] 11. And Sarah by faith
[1:34:00] re huh was quickened by faith to
[1:34:04] conceive seed. And I wonder how many
[1:34:07] through these years have been listening
[1:34:10] to the ministry of Malachi 4 and
[1:34:13] Revelations 10:7 and the conception.
[1:34:18] Understand it must be Christ in you
[1:34:21] being birthed.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; That's what you're pregnant with.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; He come to quicken the seed
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; to bring forth. He's cloning himself.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; What is it? This is a mystery that's
[1:34:36] been hid down through the ages.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Do you realize all of you sitting here
[1:34:40] right now, you're a part of the mystery?
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And I will declare that you are a
[1:34:46] mystery unto yourself.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; You're no different than Mary. How can
[1:34:51] this be?
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I'm nobody special.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; The angel said, "I disagree with you.
[1:34:56] You are highly favored."
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; That ought to put a smile on somebody's
[1:35:03] face.
[1:35:04] That ain't this ain't because
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; huh
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; that you were so good.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because you kept all the
[1:35:13] commandments.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; It wasn't. Well, it was because God had
[1:35:19] a covenant
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; to the seed.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Because that's what this whole thing is
[1:35:25] about. It's about the seed
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; and it's about you. Because if you have
[1:35:30] the seed inside of you, you were
[1:35:33] predestinated
[1:35:34] to hear the promises to be activated in
[1:35:38] your life for this hour.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; How dare you pass it off to some
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Hagar?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; When it was first told to Sarah, she
[1:35:54] laughed.
[1:35:56] Let me say this is no laughing matter.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; It's not a time in our immaturity.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; The days of being immature are over.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Huh? One saying I'm of Paul and another
[1:36:13] Apollos. He said, "Are you not just
[1:36:15] babes in Christ?"
[1:36:17] Who is Paul and who is Apollos? Are they
[1:36:20] not just workers? If we're not careful,
[1:36:23] what we've done is we've divided ourself
[1:36:25] up within the message until one won't
[1:36:28] fellowship with another because my
[1:36:30] daddy's bigger than your daddy. My
[1:36:32] church is better than your church.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Stop that.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; I actually now let me let me just say
[1:36:41] this so you understand. It's not how
[1:36:43] many people
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; that a pastor may be a pastor over it.
[1:36:52] I actually
[1:36:55] I actually have a great deep respect of
[1:37:00] a pastor that's just got 15 or 20
[1:37:02] people.
[1:37:05] I do. You know why?
[1:37:08] Because when it's just a small group,
[1:37:10] everybody knows everybody.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:37:18] You know how hard it is as a pastor when
[1:37:22] you've got just a small little group, a
[1:37:24] handful, 15, 20 people, and one whole
[1:37:29] family is sick for that whole week. Boy,
[1:37:31] do you ever miss them?
[1:37:33] Where were you? Well, we were sorry we
[1:37:36] were all sick. Okay.
[1:37:40] [crying]
[1:37:41] So I have such a respect because it is
[1:37:44] not the amount.
[1:37:46] Okay. It's easy to preach with a whole
[1:37:50] church full of people. In fact, many of
[1:37:54] you can hide among the multitude.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; But when it's just a handful where there
[1:38:01] only 15 or 20, you can't hide. I'm
[1:38:04] talking to you.
[1:38:07] You see, and then everybody, I know who
[1:38:08] he's talking about.
[1:38:10] I know why the pastor said that. Cuz
[1:38:13] John said this or he did that or she did
[1:38:16] this. I know he's But here, you can sit.
[1:38:19] You can come here and if you're not
[1:38:20] careful, you'll sit here
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; and you'll be
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; lonely.
[1:38:37] You will sit there
[1:38:40] and be unaccounted for.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Going to church.
[1:38:48] May I say this? Becoming the church
[1:38:50] because you are the temple.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Going to church is far more important
[1:38:57] than you realize.
[1:39:03] Because there is going to be times when
[1:39:05] you come and you got an issue,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; And you need a word and you need God and
[1:39:11] maybe the pastor don't know nothing what
[1:39:14] you're going through.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; But all of a sudden he'll go to
[1:39:16] preaching about something and all of a
[1:39:18] sudden you're going, "Yes, Lord.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; How did [screaming] he know?"
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; The father is revealing it. to his
[1:39:30] servant and his servant speaking it. So
[1:39:32] you catch the idea that God is mindful
[1:39:36] of you.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, pastor, thank you. Thank you.
[1:39:43] [snorts] That really helped me. I don't
[1:39:45] even know what I said that helped you.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; I'm ignorant.
[1:39:50] I don't know what you have need of,
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; but he does. Yes. Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Those that have an ear to hear will hear
[1:40:04] what the spirit is saying. See, by
[1:40:06] revelation, they come under the
[1:40:07] obedience of that [snorts] messenger and
[1:40:10] they line up with the word.
[1:40:13] Remember one of the final visions, he
[1:40:14] saw the bride getting out of step
[1:40:21] and he wakes himself. Get back in line.
[1:40:31] I believe that this is the time that the
[1:40:34] spirit is calling out to the bride
[1:40:37] wherever she be. Stay in line.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Don't get out of step. Stay in step with
[1:40:43] the word.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; He's doing it. He's speaking it.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Stay in line.
[1:40:56] And when you get in line and you come
[1:40:58] under the obedience of that messenger's
[1:41:01] voice,
[1:41:03] then the voice changes.
[1:41:06] It continues.
[1:41:08] It's the same voice in a different
[1:41:10] vessel.
[1:41:14] It becomes the final voice.
[1:41:17] All of you understand Brother Bram is
[1:41:19] not the final voice.
[1:41:21] Amen.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; If he was the final voice, then what he
[1:41:29] said that the ministry of the bride and
[1:41:32] she would be the final voice to the
[1:41:33] final age.
[1:41:35] Then what you do is just well then I
[1:41:38] guess he's the final voice. So that's
[1:41:40] it. It's over. It's done with. And we
[1:41:42] just sit back and we wait until God
[1:41:44] raptures us.
[1:41:47] And then you deny the very position that
[1:41:49] God wants you to get into.
[1:41:51] Because this Jesus said these works that
[1:41:54] I do
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; didn't stop with him. Didn't stop when
[1:42:00] he went to Calvary. And when he said it
[1:42:01] is finished,
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; it continues.
[1:42:07] This message continues.
[1:42:11] The message
[1:42:14] believing community is greater in number
[1:42:18] than it was when he was here.
[1:42:22] Are you aware of that?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; There were so few in the early 60s that
[1:42:28] began to catch
[1:42:30] not just that he he had some kind of
[1:42:33] prophetic ministry and under first and
[1:42:35] second pole because that never caught
[1:42:37] anyone. It caught their attention and
[1:42:40] they all said, "Oh, he's a great man of
[1:42:42] God. He does." He said, "Oh, let's wait
[1:42:44] do more miracles."
[1:42:47] Come on. We want to see a sign miracles
[1:42:49] discern and and and opens eyes. I want
[1:42:53] to ask you
[1:42:56] the ministry of Jesus Christ after the
[1:42:59] resurrection.
[1:43:01] The only miracle that he does
[1:43:06] in a resurrected form
[1:43:09] is to open eyes.
[1:43:13] and the two on the road to Emmus. Emmas
[1:43:16] means earnest desire.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; All of you understand that had you asked
[1:43:23] Cleopus and that other disciple several
[1:43:26] weeks before the crucifixion
[1:43:29] and you would ask him, "Are you a
[1:43:31] believer?" Oh yes, guaranteed. I'm 100%.
[1:43:36] I believe this is the I believe this is
[1:43:39] the one. I believe this message. I'm all
[1:43:42] in.
[1:43:44] But after he was taken and crucified,
[1:43:51] they entered a state of confusion.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; I thought
[1:43:57] I thought this was the one.
[1:44:02] And Jesus,
[1:44:05] understand this,
[1:44:07] he drew near
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; and there was a union.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I love this.
[1:44:18] Their confusion
[1:44:20] of what God
[1:44:23] was fulfilling in their hour did not
[1:44:25] stop the revelation coming to them. Very
[1:44:29] good.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Neither will it stop with you. You say,
[1:44:32] "Well, I [screaming] I thought this is
[1:44:34] the message of the hour." If this is the
[1:44:36] message the hour, ah, I tell you what,
[1:44:39] why are the people all so broke up? Why
[1:44:41] is there confusion? Why is one saying
[1:44:43] this? And why is another saying this and
[1:44:45] over here and nobody's fellowshipping?
[1:44:47] Ah, if this is a bride, I don't know.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; All confused.
[1:44:57] So Jesus,
[1:45:00] he joined himself.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; You know what God's doing with the bride
[1:45:07] right now?
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Not because of your revelation.
[1:45:13] It might be in the midst of your
[1:45:15] confusion.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:45:18] [snorts] I don't know what to believe
[1:45:20] anymore.
[1:45:21] I thought, asked some of you several
[1:45:24] years ago. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is it.
[1:45:27] My, we're so excited. This is the
[1:45:30] message of the hour. Rapturing faith.
[1:45:33] Oh, hallelujah. And then one brings this
[1:45:36] message and another brings that message
[1:45:38] and this group gets pulled off here and
[1:45:40] that group gets pulled off and it
[1:45:42] divides fellowship and it breeds hatred
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; and causes bitterness.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Those things ought not to be
[1:45:56] So there in the midst of there all their
[1:46:00] confusion.
[1:46:01] So Jesus now
[1:46:04] Jesus now joins himself. Listen, be
[1:46:06] spiritual. Now catch this. He makes a
[1:46:09] union.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Here's the word revealed in its hour, in
[1:46:14] its season.
[1:46:16] Here is the resurrected Christ and he
[1:46:20] walks and he joins them.
[1:46:22] And they don't. The Bible says that
[1:46:24] their eyes were holding.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; I want to say that I believe there are
[1:46:30] so many
[1:46:32] message believers that their eyes are
[1:46:34] still holding.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; They can't really see the forest for the
[1:46:39] trees. Come on.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; They're looking around at all of the
[1:46:44] symptoms and all of the issues and they
[1:46:47] get discouraged and they said, "We
[1:46:49] thought,
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; we thought this was going to be a great
[1:46:53] revival." And we saw this one get up and
[1:46:56] this one, he took this little group and
[1:46:58] it was all emotion for a while until it
[1:47:01] just
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; What happened to all those people that
[1:47:05] went off into some kind of ism?
[1:47:09] The devil will show you everyone that
[1:47:12] goes off into a tangent and takes the
[1:47:16] people away and then he'll make you
[1:47:18] fearful.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Well, understand
[1:47:23] he'll he'll take you either way.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; He'll show you those that went too far,
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; but he won't show you those who didn't
[1:47:32] go far enough.
[1:47:34] He actually said, "Those
[1:47:37] who call me God
[1:47:40] have got a greater revelation than those
[1:47:42] who call me prophet."
[1:47:49] Wow.
[1:47:52] Do you understand?
[1:47:55] Revelation to you is more important than
[1:47:58] perhaps you realize.
[1:48:01] And we are entering now a quickening
[1:48:05] stage among the bride.
[1:48:08] Okay?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; It's not a church.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; This is not just this building.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; We're talking a body thou hast prepared
[1:48:18] for me. You were prepared to receive
[1:48:21] this message. You are the vessel that
[1:48:23] God was looking after.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; You are the Mary, if you please.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; That the angel could not leave until
[1:48:32] Mary said, "Be it unto me."
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Malachi 4, Revelations
[1:48:39] 10:7, could not leave
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; until he got hurt
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; to agree.
[1:48:47] [applause]
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; How many of you say, "I agree."
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have it all figured out.
[1:48:55] About the time I think I got all figured
[1:48:56] out, guess what? Along comes something
[1:48:59] else.
[1:49:00] I don't know nothing.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Re
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; and I realize more revelation God gives
[1:49:06] me the less I know.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Take that
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; and filter it for a minute. He said God
[1:49:19] is so great it will take an eternity
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; to reveal himself. So here in this
[1:49:25] little finite glitch of time
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; in loud
[1:49:32] 26
[1:49:33] in surprise Arizona.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; God
[1:49:38] is still working this out
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; and he's working it out with you and he
[1:49:44] that begun the good work in you is going
[1:49:47] to finish it.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; You realize you're the mystery.
[1:49:53] You're a mystery to yourself.
[1:49:55] Who me?
[1:49:57] Who am I?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Now, [snorts]
[1:50:12] do you know God's his own interpreter?
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you are the
[1:50:18] interpretation of this message?
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; He said the bride's going to have
[1:50:25] certain characteristics, these virtues,
[1:50:28] and she'll be dressed like this. She
[1:50:30] will act like this, this will be and on
[1:50:32] and on on like that. You know what he
[1:50:34] said? You know he's talking about
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; you sitting here this morning
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; under the sound of my voice in this
[1:50:44] congregation right now are the
[1:50:46] continuation
[1:50:48] of this prophet's message.
[1:50:51] May I say it? You're the interpretation.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Because take away that prophet
[1:50:57] messenger, there would be no
[1:50:59] interpretation. But because there is a
[1:51:02] people in the land who under their
[1:51:04] prophet,
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; they begin to know who they are, take
[1:51:09] their position, and then they have power
[1:51:12] and authority.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; People want power and authority without
[1:51:16] position.
[1:51:18] Preach,
[1:51:20] brother.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Since when do we command God to do
[1:51:22] anything?
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; You see up here, I command in the name
[1:51:26] of Jesus Christ, loose this man. Well, I
[1:51:29] listened to a sermon the other day in
[1:51:31] 1952 and it most all was a discernment
[1:51:35] line. And brother Brandon was very calm.
[1:51:39] God bless you, sir. Why? Why? Come
[1:51:42] closer. He said, that's just him. Now,
[1:51:44] if God will reveal to me what's wrong
[1:51:46] with you, would you have faith in God?
[1:51:50] Oh, I see. I see you have arthritis.
[1:51:54] Oh, I see this, this, this. Oh, he says,
[1:51:58] I see there's a woman out there that
[1:52:00] when I said this about him, you just
[1:52:02] raised up and yes, sister in the red
[1:52:04] dress, God. He says, "If God would
[1:52:07] reveal to me what your problem is,
[1:52:12] would you receive your healing?"
[1:52:16] He said, "Yeah, you know what it is." He
[1:52:18] says, "The very thoughts I'm thinking
[1:52:20] right now are the thoughts you're
[1:52:22] thinking."
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; My
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "Yeah, you know what it is?
[1:52:29] That pain you have?"
[1:52:33] He says, "Yeah, it's cancer."
[1:52:38] He said, "Now,"
[1:52:40] he says, "He allowed me to say that.
[1:52:42] Would you believe me to be God's
[1:52:44] prophet?"
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, you would. Would you believe me that
[1:52:48] the same one that is revealing to me
[1:52:50] what you have
[1:52:53] is here telling you, "Have faith in
[1:52:56] God."
[1:52:58] That's right. He said, "Oh, I see. I see
[1:53:02] you've entered. Yes. He says, did you
[1:53:05] feel that that quickening power come
[1:53:07] over you?
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. He says you're healed.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Go your way. And it wasn't no big prayer
[1:53:16] line.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; It was simply, do you believe?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Many of you, you have needs. Have faith
[1:53:25] in God.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah, but my need is great. Since when
[1:53:29] is your need greater than the needs that
[1:53:31] are the people before you?
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; It is. Did you know that your need is
[1:53:38] what brings him on the scene?
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; You have a need. You call upon God. So
[1:53:46] God sends a spirit of one of the seven
[1:53:50] redemptive names of Jehovah.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; You have need of healing. I'm Jehovah
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Rafa.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; I'm the God that heals all of your
[1:54:04] diseases.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, you have a need. I see that need. He
[1:54:10] said he's a God that provides all the
[1:54:14] needs.
[1:54:15] His name is Jehovah Gyra.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; He provides in every need. You realize
[1:54:23] out of those seven redemptive names of
[1:54:26] God
[1:54:28] that every need you will ever go
[1:54:30] through,
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; all you have to do is say one of those
[1:54:34] names holds within it the key
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; of what I have need of. And when I call
[1:54:40] on him,
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:54:45] forever. He's Jehovah Cano.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:51] I have need of peace. I'm in a midst of
[1:54:53] trouble and trials.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; I'm in a quandry.
[1:54:59] I'm confused.
[1:55:03] And in the midst,
[1:55:05] he can anoint you and say, "Peace."
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Peace I give unto you. Not as the world
[1:55:11] gives.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; I'm Jehovah. Shalom.
[1:55:19] Oh.
[1:55:23] Yeah, that's okay. I'm going to just go
[1:55:27] a little bit further
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; in the invisible union of the bride of
[1:55:35] Christ.
[1:55:36] Brother Brennham says, "He, the
[1:55:38] bridegroom, took away your shame
[1:55:43] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:55:45] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:55:48] and the blood of life.
[1:55:50] That's what the Bible said. Your first
[1:55:52] husband that you were married to. Now,
[1:55:54] follow along with this.
[1:55:58] Now, I'm going to I'm going to say
[1:56:00] something here. I'm going to throw you a
[1:56:02] curveball.
[1:56:06] Christ can only marry a virgin.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Not a forgiven woman.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:17] He's a high priest.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; And according to Leviticus 21, a high
[1:56:23] priest must marry a virgin,
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; not defiled
[1:56:28] in any way, untouched.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham goes so far as to
[1:56:35] say, "Your first husband, you were
[1:56:38] married to the world.
[1:56:40] You were born in sin, shaped in
[1:56:43] iniquity, came into the world speaking
[1:56:45] nothing but truth.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; What was it?
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Lies. Lies.
[1:56:54] Lies. Nobody had to teach you how to
[1:56:56] lie. You knew it from your little
[1:56:59] childhood. Did you get into that cake?
[1:57:02] No. Not me, mama. And you got frosting
[1:57:05] all over your face and all over your
[1:57:07] hand. And you sit there and mama said,
[1:57:08] "Did you get into that cake?" No, I
[1:57:10] didn't. And you look and you can see the
[1:57:13] evidences all over. I want all of you to
[1:57:16] to know that you were born in sin,
[1:57:18] shaped in iniquity. You were
[1:57:20] adulterators, fornicators, idoltors.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; You were gentile doves.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Full of blasphemy, full of adultery.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; You were undone. You needed a savior.
[1:57:39] Then how could you ever be his bride?
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; You were already married to a first
[1:57:46] husband.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Satan who had to rule over you.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Your first husband. This is what he
[1:57:53] said.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Your first husband.
[1:57:56] [snorts]
[1:57:58] He says that's what the he he says the
[1:58:03] bridegroom
[1:58:05] [snorts]
[1:58:07] that's what the Bible said your first
[1:58:08] husband that you were married to the
[1:58:10] world anointed then he goes into the
[1:58:13] anointed bridegroom which for ordained
[1:58:16] you has washed you by the washing of the
[1:58:20] water. Amen.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Now understand that when he does
[1:58:24] something, he does it well.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; By the church congregation said, "No,
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; that don't sound right, does it?" You
[1:58:34] might find that in the almanac, but not
[1:58:36] in God's Bible. You are standing. No,
[1:58:39] no, wait a second. He cannot marry
[1:58:42] a forgiven woman.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; She's got to be a virgin bride. You are
[1:58:49] standing completely justified as though
[1:58:52] you never did it at the beginning. That
[1:58:55] is my message to the church now.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; You are standing. If you're standing in
[1:59:03] God's word with God's word, every amen,
[1:59:06] every jot, every tit,
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; where are you standing? I'm trying to
[1:59:09] tell you,
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; pull away from them shocks.
[1:59:14] Get out here in the wheat
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; where you can get right before the sun.
[1:59:19] I hear the coming of the combine. You're
[1:59:21] standing complete, justified like you
[1:59:24] never did it in the first place.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Talk about a thanksgiving. I feel real
[1:59:35] good.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; You are the pure now. Now watch. He's
[1:59:41] speaking the word.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. You are the pure, virtuous, sinless
[1:59:45] bride of the son of the living God.
[1:59:47] Every man and woman that's born of the
[1:59:49] spirit of God, washed in the blood of
[1:59:51] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[1:59:53] God, stands as though you never sinned
[1:59:55] at the first place. You are perfect.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm gonna skip just a little bit.
[2:00:12] I just I want to fast forward.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; I want to come to a good part. It's all
[2:00:18] good,
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; but I don't want to bog you down.
[2:00:22] Brother [snorts] Brandham said in
[2:00:23] marriage and divorce, now he now this is
[2:00:27] one of those sermons that he said. Now,
[2:00:30] he said, "I want to bring to you the
[2:00:32] truth on marriage and divorce." Amen.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "The reason we've got ministers
[2:00:37] and good people that's been married four
[2:00:39] and five times is because they went into
[2:00:41] it wrong and they were under
[2:00:43] misconstrued theology."
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this.
[2:00:53] Understand this. Now, I'm going to lay a
[2:00:55] precedent here. No minister can marry a
[2:00:58] woman who's been touched by men.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Not a forgiven woman.
[2:01:04] not a divorced woman,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; adulteress,
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; but your union to your husband, Christ
[2:01:13] the word is what cleanses you. The blood
[2:01:18] sanctifies the defiled woman.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Now, in marriage and divorce, brother
[2:01:24] said there is no minister that can marry
[2:01:26] a widow.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Did you know that? You want to read
[2:01:30] that? All right, let's go to Leviticus
[2:01:32] chapter 21.
[2:01:34] And I'll tell you, if you go to
[2:01:36] Leviticus chapter 21 and you read from
[2:01:39] verse 7 to verse 14,
[2:01:45] you will find out.
[2:01:48] He says, "No minister
[2:01:51] can marry a widow, a woman that's been
[2:01:54] touched,
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; anything. She's got to be a virgin
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; bride.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Then he goes Ezekiel 42:44
[2:02:06] priesthood was to not marry a woman
[2:02:08] that's been touched by man. This type of
[2:02:11] the virgin bride of Christ of Jesus
[2:02:13] Christ because they handle the fire of
[2:02:16] God. The priesthood Aaron's sons.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; They could not marry another woman and a
[2:02:21] woman been touched by a man. showing in
[2:02:23] type here if you want to see it that the
[2:02:26] church of the living God is purely
[2:02:27] unadulterated the word of God and not
[2:02:30] even a denomination that's been handled
[2:02:32] by men.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that the union
[2:02:42] that you have with your kinsman redeemer
[2:02:48] can take
[2:02:50] Rahab
[2:02:55] Come on.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Can take Ruth.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Can take Tamar.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Do you really realize what happened
[2:03:10] with Ruth
[2:03:12] here? Because
[2:03:15] Naomi had a union with her husband and
[2:03:18] his name was IMC.
[2:03:21] And because of financial reasons and
[2:03:25] economic hardship, IMC took Naomi
[2:03:30] and they moved with their two daughters,
[2:03:33] excuse me, two sons
[2:03:36] and
[2:03:37] their sons got married.
[2:03:41] And guess what? The father dies and the
[2:03:44] and the boys die.
[2:03:47] Naomi
[2:03:49] says, "Don't call me Naomi.
[2:03:52] Call me Mara."
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; For God hath dealt with me bitterly.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Naomi, are you listening to me this
[2:04:04] morning?
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Some of you are saying, "The things that
[2:04:07] have happened to me are bitter. I can't
[2:04:09] call myself blessed.
[2:04:12] I don't understand it.
[2:04:15] How can you [screaming] call me Naomi?
[2:04:17] Call me Mara
[2:04:20] because the vision doesn't match the
[2:04:22] reality.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; She talks to Orpa
[2:04:31] and to Ruth and said, "Why don't you go
[2:04:33] back?"
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Why don't you go back? I have no more
[2:04:40] seed to give you. [snorts]
[2:04:43] Why didn't you go back? Orpa kissed her
[2:04:45] mother goodbye.
[2:04:48] But Ruth, what did she say?
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Watch. Because
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; of a verbal communication,
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; she activated
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; the promises of God with her own mouth.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Your God
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; will be my God.
[2:05:11] Your people will be my people. Whether
[2:05:13] thou goest, I will go. And where you
[2:05:15] die, I will die. So now she has a union
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; with Naomi
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; because of ach.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; There's an inheritance.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; So Naomi goes back to the land where she
[2:05:35] has an inheritance.
[2:05:39] Hallelujah.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; And Boaz the kinsman
[2:05:51] says, "Who's that working in the field?"
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; When he comes to her, who are you?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Reveal yourself to me. She says, "I'm
[2:06:01] Ruth the Moabitete."
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; The Moabitis was under a curse for 10
[2:06:07] generations.
[2:06:08] Amen.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; You remember preaching that, brother
[2:06:10] Warren?
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; He should have said, "Ain't no way."
[2:06:16] [snorts]
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Man, all of a sudden, all this what I
[2:06:19] thought might be cannot be.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand because of
[2:06:26] Naomi's relationship to her husband, she
[2:06:30] has a inheritance through IMC by way of
[2:06:34] a kinsman redeemer. and Ruth.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Because she has joined herself,
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; she comes under the same union,
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; the same covenant.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Well, had she been married before?
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Her husband died.
[2:07:02] No kids.
[2:07:07] And yet
[2:07:10] her union
[2:07:12] with Boaz,
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; are you listening to me?
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Let let this drop very very deep in your
[2:07:23] heart this morning
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; because of your union. Brother Brandham
[2:07:28] said, "This is the uniting time
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; and I am the sign
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; and here it is." And this is the end
[2:07:39] time
[2:07:40] seed sign.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; This is a union that's taking place.
[2:07:46] Amen.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; And this union that you have with your
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; husband, Christ the word,
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; he cleanses you
[2:07:59] so far beyond
[2:08:02] your faults and your failures until you
[2:08:04] come to the place
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; you are perfect.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; You are sinless.
[2:08:18] Do you realize
[2:08:21] that this union that's taking place with
[2:08:23] what we call the message of the hour? Do
[2:08:25] you realize the message of the hour is
[2:08:27] Christ?
[2:08:29] Amen.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; And your mere association with this
[2:08:33] message brings to it a washing
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; of the water by the word
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; and by the cleansing of the blood until
[2:08:45] you're justified.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Justified.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Say that again.
[2:08:56] Say it loud so everybody can hear.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Justified.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Justified.
[2:09:10] You never did it in the first place.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; You're justified.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Justified.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; I never did. Amen.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not just forgiven.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Justified.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; My union with him became so perfect
[2:09:34] because he's a perfect word.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; I will become a perfect bride.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Do you realize who you are? Do you
[2:09:45] realize what this message, what kind of
[2:09:47] power it's got in it?
[2:09:49] You realize what it's doing and how it's
[2:09:51] calling a people.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; You realize that you are the
[2:09:55] interpretation of this message.
[2:10:00] [snorts]
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Without you,
[2:10:02] there was no need for a messenger.
[2:10:07] But because there was a need,
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; God said,
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; "These are the days of Elijah,
[2:10:19] declaring the word of the Lord." Don't
[2:10:22] Don't Don't let it just be a song.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; You want to know what an Elijah ministry
[2:10:28] was like?
[2:10:31] [sighs]
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. A oneman army.
[2:10:36] [snorts]
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; 450 false prophets.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Mount Carmel showdown.
[2:10:45] I and I alone remain a prophet of the
[2:10:47] Lord.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; And the God that answers by fire.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; This message, my brother and sister,
[2:10:55] is a message of fire.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Don't play with fire.
[2:11:03] And the God that answered
[2:11:05] by fire, let him be God.
[2:11:10] Do you realize
[2:11:12] that God has joined with you
[2:11:16] because of the pillar of fire?
[2:11:19] Do you know he's consumed
[2:11:22] your sacrifice?
[2:11:24] There nothing left.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[2:11:30] Behold, all things
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; are passed away. Behold, all things. Do
[2:11:37] you realize I'm a new creation?
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Not this first one done over. No,
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; he is now creating himself,
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; a bride.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; The bride is under the headship of the
[2:11:54] word. Just as Ezer gave Rebecca
[2:11:58] garments,
[2:12:00] a veil, and things to make her ready to
[2:12:03] meet Isaac, so has the end time
[2:12:05] messenger giving us a message that's
[2:12:08] clothing the bride
[2:12:13] is brother Brandham the final voice.
[2:12:18] Then anybody [snorts] who tells you all
[2:12:21] you have to do is press play and that is
[2:12:26] the token for the hour is deceiving you
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; when you begin to discern and withstand
[2:12:35] the two spirits within the framework of
[2:12:37] the church because to just press play
[2:12:41] and not to obey is a Catholic spirit.
[2:12:47] You nailed it.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Instead of lighting a candle, we'll
[2:12:51] press play. God never ordained
[2:12:53] mechanical devices.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Say what the tapes say, sir.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; You won't hear them say that.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't Don't get choked up now.
[2:13:09] Whoa, brother. You know, hey, I ain't
[2:13:12] after any special person or thing. It's
[2:13:15] a spirit.
[2:13:18] It's a spirit
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; and it'll be so close
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; to deceive the very elect if possible.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; But you cannot deceive the elect. Why?
[2:13:29] The word is her absolute.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; So if the voice
[2:13:41] of the prophet is the only voice and the
[2:13:44] last voice
[2:13:46] then there is no
[2:13:48] voice today.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; So then we got to go back to what the
[2:13:52] voice was then.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I won't always be
[2:13:56] your pastor.
[2:13:58] Let go listen to the tapes."
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Find a home church.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Have a pastor. Pay your tithe. Have a
[2:14:06] post of duty. Go there and do the That's
[2:14:08] what he said."
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, [snorts] brother Bram, loud as
[2:14:15] he in church eight musicians, if you
[2:14:17] come, I'm going to close. Okay, boy.
[2:14:21] The church is no longer the mouthpiece
[2:14:23] of God. It's its own mean mouthpiece.
[2:14:26] So, God is turning on her.
[2:14:30] He will confound her through the prophet
[2:14:35] and through the prophet only.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Keep reading. Keep reading.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Don't add to. Don't take away.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Don't get in front of me.
[2:14:55] No, you're You know what? I want you to
[2:14:57] keep reading.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; He will confound her
[2:15:03] through the prophet
[2:15:06] and
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; the bride.
[2:15:09] For the voice of God will be in him.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? I'm not taking away
[2:15:21] from the importance of the prophet
[2:15:23] because listen, since day one when God
[2:15:26] opened my ears of understanding that God
[2:15:29] sent a messenger, I have always said
[2:15:33] I'm pointing back to that message.
[2:15:37] But then that message, what does it say?
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What does it say?
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Keep reading, man.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Don't stop.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; He will confound her through the prophet
[2:15:54] and the bride. For the voice of God will
[2:15:56] be in her. Yes, it is. 4 says in the
[2:15:59] last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the
[2:16:02] spirit and the bride say come once more
[2:16:06] the world will hear directly from God as
[2:16:09] at Pentecost but of course the word
[2:16:11] bride will be refudiated
[2:16:15] as it was in the first church age
[2:16:18] refudiate or repudiate repudiate I
[2:16:21] didn't know what it was you know brother
[2:16:23] Ren doesn't use that word
[2:16:26] that's one of them leave Bill,
[2:16:27] intellectual words.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Repudiate. What does repudiate?
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, you English majors. Kayla, what
[2:16:35] does repudiate mean?
[2:16:39] That's what I said. I thought I'm going
[2:16:41] to look it up. What does Webster say?
[2:16:43] Repudiate.
[2:16:45] To cast off, to disown,
[2:16:48] to refuse to have anything to do with,
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:16:52] to refuse to acknowledge, accept or to
[2:16:55] pay. The synonyms are to spurn, reject,
[2:16:59] and decline. [music]
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; So this last day voice will be
[2:17:05] repudiated, rejected, spurned,
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; disanulled,
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; for anyone, I don't care who [snorts]
[2:17:13] they are,
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; to tell you that the bride will not have
[2:17:17] a ministry. And the only voice there is
[2:17:20] that God will use in this end time is
[2:17:23] the prophet is [music] teaching you
[2:17:25] false doctrine.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Let the chips fall where they lay. I am
[2:17:31] not after any special person. It is a
[2:17:34] spirit. [music]
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; So when you begin to understand that two
[2:17:42] spirits, somebody say two
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; two
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; within the framework of the church.
[2:17:48] Yeah.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; And by God's spirit
[2:17:52] discern
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; and
[2:17:56] withstand.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; You remember here I here I stand
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; came out. I started to tell you the
[2:18:11] other day
[2:18:13] when brother [snorts and music] Joseph
[2:18:14] Brham
[2:18:16] came with catch the vision tour and was
[2:18:19] here in Phoenix and I told you I talked
[2:18:22] to Joseph personally about here I stand
[2:18:29] and I I went I went to the meeting that
[2:18:32] day. It was a it was a minister's
[2:18:34] meeting and
[2:18:37] um it was a lunchon and so brother
[2:18:39] Joseph Dalton,
[2:18:41] Joe Dalton, one of my best friends and
[2:18:44] his brother Jim Jim Ed Dalton
[2:18:48] said, "Brother Ron, come go with us."
[2:18:50] Ah, I'm not.
[2:18:52] No, come go with us. So I did.
[2:18:55] So, we went to the meetings and Joe
[2:18:59] says, uh, Joe tells me, Joe Dalton, he
[2:19:02] said, "Where do you want to sit?" I I
[2:19:05] don't care. I'm going to go use the
[2:19:07] restroom. [music]
[2:19:08] Just go get a a get a seat that I can
[2:19:11] sit next to you. So, they went in and
[2:19:13] sat down and the table was I don't know,
[2:19:16] I off the my memory maybe 60, 80 feet
[2:19:19] long. And there were all kinds of
[2:19:22] ministers and different ones and they
[2:19:23] all got that lapel pin with the wave
[2:19:25] sheath. [music] You ever seen it? Huh?
[2:19:28] They all had that and you know
[2:19:31] and uh so we walked in and uh there was
[2:19:35] brother Joe and brother Billy and there
[2:19:37] was a whole crowd, a whole entourage of
[2:19:39] people
[2:19:41] and uh we went and just sat down at the
[2:19:45] table.
[2:19:47] [snorts and music] We're at the end of
[2:19:48] the table
[2:19:50] and um brother Joseph and brother Billy,
[2:19:53] they signaled to me to come with all
[2:19:56] those people.
[2:19:59] I said, "No, [music] no, it's okay. So
[2:20:02] many people, hey, I I'll catch you
[2:20:04] later."
[2:20:06] So wound up that we sat at the end of
[2:20:09] the table. Well, guess what? Guess who
[2:20:11] sat at the end of the table?
[2:20:13] Brother Joseph, Brother Billy Paul,
[2:20:16] Brother George Smith, and we all sat at
[2:20:18] the table. And guess what? Brother
[2:20:21] Joseph Brandom and Brother Billy Paul
[2:20:23] Brandom and myself are going over all of
[2:20:27] the trips that we made. And the people I
[2:20:29] introduced them to, oh, Brother Ron, do
[2:20:30] you remember? And with this and that,
[2:20:32] and here's all these ministers at the
[2:20:34] other end of the table. They all quit
[2:20:36] talking. They wanted to eaves drop on
[2:20:38] our conversation.
[2:20:43] Who is this guy? He don't even have a
[2:20:46] lapel pin on. He's not even dressed up.
[2:20:52] Can't be a believer.
[2:20:56] So, I brought with me a whole manila
[2:20:59] envelope about the copyright. [music]
[2:21:04] Do you know that brother Brennan tried
[2:21:05] to stop everyone from [music] giving out
[2:21:08] this message in tape or book form
[2:21:11] because he said, "I'm the only one that
[2:21:13] has the right." [music]
[2:21:14] How many of you know that?
[2:21:17] Yeah. Yeah. He stopped. He wrote every
[2:21:20] letter or a letter to every minister
[2:21:23] that was printing this message. And he
[2:21:26] says, "If you print this message outside
[2:21:29] of Jeffersonville, it's stolen bread."
[2:21:32] How many of you know that? He said it's
[2:21:34] mine. Nobody [music] knows this.
[2:21:37] Don't Didn't you read what he said?
[2:21:41] He said, "If you are printing this
[2:21:43] message
[2:21:45] without our permission and our
[2:21:47] copyright, you have no right and it's
[2:21:49] stolen bread."
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; So he wrote to brother Biscll, David
[2:21:54] Momus, [music] he wrote to all of these
[2:21:57] ministers and said, "Cease and desist."
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Was brother Billy
[2:22:02] Pardon?
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; It was brother Billy Paul that said
[2:22:04] that.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; No, brother Joseph.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. You said you said brother.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Did I say Oh, okay.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; It was [music] technically
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; it was brother Joseph. I'm sorry. Thank
[2:22:12] you, Stephen.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; You got my back. Don't you stand up here
[2:22:16] in case I say something else. You can
[2:22:20] I'm sorry. I kind of get lost in my
[2:22:23] thoughts.
[2:22:26] Do you know that when I went to work for
[2:22:29] Okay, let me finish this because I don't
[2:22:31] want to rabbit trail. I told you I spoke
[2:22:32] to brother Joseph about
[2:22:35] the [music] here I stand
[2:22:38] but I had a manila envelope and I
[2:22:40] thought this is not the time nor the
[2:22:42] place because there is a time in a place
[2:22:44] and here's with all these ministers. I
[2:22:46] am not going to sit here and conf
[2:22:49] I'll catch you later. So I went to go
[2:22:52] use the restroom. The meetings are over.
[2:22:56] And I thought, "Ah, I'll I'll get a
[2:22:59] chance to talk to him later." So, as I
[2:23:02] went to the restroom, I was coming out.
[2:23:05] Guess who's going in? Brother Joseph
[2:23:08] Brandham.
[2:23:10] I said, "Come here, Brother Joseph." And
[2:23:13] there next to the entrance to the men's
[2:23:15] restroom were two big artificial trees.
[2:23:18] And I said, "Hey, come here." I pulled
[2:23:20] him to the side and I I said, "Come over
[2:23:22] here where if people go in and out, they
[2:23:24] won't see us."
[2:23:27] I said, "Brother Joseph, you know, I'm
[2:23:30] just your friend. I'm a nobody."
[2:23:35] I said, "But this, here I stand. I
[2:23:37] wished I could have talked to you before
[2:23:40] you wrote it.
[2:23:42] I I I believe I could have [music] maybe
[2:23:45] helped give you a balance."
[2:23:48] Now I lie not and I tell you before God.
[2:23:51] These are exactly what he told me.
[2:23:53] Brother Ron, I wish you would have.
[2:23:58] He says, "Because when I make a mistake,
[2:24:00] I make it in front of everyone."
[2:24:07] [music] I said, "Brother Joseph,"
[2:24:10] I said, "You have no right to copyright
[2:24:14] God's voice."
[2:24:16] I said, 'If this what you say is the
[2:24:19] copyright.
[2:24:22] I said, 'Then change the name. It's not
[2:24:24] the voice of God. It's the voice of
[2:24:26] William Brano. And you have a right to
[2:24:28] every royalty and everything. And you
[2:24:31] know what? It's your daddy's message.
[2:24:33] But I said, your daddy said, I have
[2:24:36] nothing to do with this message except
[2:24:38] [music]
[2:24:38] a voice. Against my own better judgment,
[2:24:41] I want to be a trapper.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; I lost the feeling for the people. Oh, I
[2:24:46] did the first and second pull. I did all
[2:24:49] these signs and all of this stuff and
[2:24:51] guess what? They just rejected it. I'm
[2:24:54] done. What good is it done for all of
[2:24:56] that? He lost the feeling.
[2:25:00] If ministers are not careful, you lose
[2:25:02] the feeling because people are not
[2:25:04] catching what they should.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; But hang on, hang on. It ain't over till
[2:25:08] it's over
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; because [music] there is a due season.
[2:25:12] That's what I want all of you to know.
[2:25:14] When it looks the worst,
[2:25:18] when it looks as though
[2:25:21] the message is nothing but a mess age
[2:25:26] and all kinds of confusion, hang on.
[2:25:28] Hang on. God ain't done yet.
[2:25:38] It's not only hearing the voice of the
[2:25:40] seventh angel messenger.
[2:25:43] It's not just pressing the tape
[2:25:46] and sitting down to listen.
[2:25:50] It's not just agreeing with the
[2:25:52] messenger and his message, [music] but
[2:25:54] it's having the ability to hear
[2:25:58] what the spirit [music] is saying to the
[2:26:00] church.
[2:26:03] And when we blend our voices with
[2:26:05] [music] his voice,
[2:26:08] when we say yay and amen to what he
[2:26:10] said, do you realize you become the
[2:26:12] sound
[2:26:14] of many waters? [music]
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:26:19] I've been there in the Congo
[2:26:23] with over 35,000 believers in in one
[2:26:26] meeting.
[2:26:29] I've never been in such a crowd,
[2:26:33] such a [music]
[2:26:35] there's just a sea of black faces.
[2:26:38] And they said, "Let's all just begin to
[2:26:40] [music] pray."
[2:26:42] And as brother Dioa was there, Shikina
[2:26:45] [music] tabernacle
[2:26:47] and he said, "Let's just all begin to
[2:26:49] pray."
[2:26:51] And there was a fervor of the pitch of
[2:26:54] voices
[2:26:55] that it sounded like a waterfall.
[2:27:00] It was a sound
[2:27:02] of many waters. I've got it on on video
[2:27:06] even on my That's what it sounds like.
[2:27:10] Sh. And the people, even the little
[2:27:12] children,
[2:27:14] the seven and eightyear-old boys were
[2:27:16] sitting there. Oh God. Oh God. They were
[2:27:19] crying. They were adding their voice
[2:27:21] [music] to the voices of others.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; I've added my voice to the voice of the
[2:27:27] seventh angel. [music]
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; I'm saying what he said.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm showing you
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; not to just
[2:27:39] try to create controversy. No,
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; because I want you to be acutely aware
[2:27:45] of the uniting time [music] and the
[2:27:48] sign.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; This is our day. This is our hour.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to pass it off.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; And I am not the only minister that's
[2:27:57] preaching this. [music]
[2:27:59] There are ministries around the world
[2:28:01] right now. Now, will the bride of Christ
[2:28:02] have a ministry before the coming? Yeah,
[2:28:05] sure. Uh-huh. It's going on right now.
[2:28:06] What is it? Apostles, prophets,
[2:28:08] evangelists, pastors, teachers. [music]
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Right. That's what's going on. He said,
[2:28:12] "Oh, don't look for these great big No,
[2:28:14] it'll it'll be so simple people will
[2:28:17] overlook it."
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; But I have joined my voice with that
[2:28:23] voice.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say the same thing?
[2:28:30] When you heard it, you said, "Amen."
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much it hurt.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you didn't
[2:28:38] understand it.
[2:28:43] Those on the road to Emmas
[2:28:45] were in a confused [music] state.
[2:28:50] They weren't sure what's going on. We
[2:28:52] thought, we thought, "Are you have
[2:28:55] haven't you been here in Jerusalem?
[2:28:56] Don't you know what's been happening?"
[2:28:58] We thought this was the one. right now
[2:29:00] we don't know. [music]
[2:29:03] We don't know.
[2:29:07] So now he he reverts to scripture
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; all the things concerning himself.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; You realize that the resurrected Christ,
[2:29:18] the interpretation of the resurrection
[2:29:20] is walking with them. You realize that
[2:29:23] he interpreted where here he was.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; I'm the inter I am the resurrection.
[2:29:32] Amen.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll said this one time in a
[2:29:36] sermon and I I loved it. It was
[2:29:41] He said, "The prophet said, "There's
[2:29:43] only one thing you're going to take away
[2:29:45] when you leave this earth. [music]
[2:29:47] There's only one thing you're taking
[2:29:48] with you." And he said, "What is that?"
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Character.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Character. Say it again.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Character. So the only thing you're
[2:29:56] going to take with you is character.
[2:29:58] Understand that those two on the road to
[2:30:01] Emmas were in a state of confusion. They
[2:30:04] weren't in a prayer meeting. They
[2:30:06] weren't asking God, "What is this
[2:30:08] message all about? What they they they
[2:30:11] were in a quandry."
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; And I love what brother Biscll said.
[2:30:18] He said, "But they had character,
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; even when they were void of revelation,
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; but because they had character,
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; he [music] joined himself to them."
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; What about you?
[2:30:37] [snorts]
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe you you've had your doubts. You've
[2:30:40] had your little questions. And this guy
[2:30:43] said that and another guy, oh, all of
[2:30:46] this stuff. And I I don't know.
[2:30:52] That's all right. God God
[2:30:56] will see you through.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Even in the state of your confusion.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's promised, "I'll get
[2:31:05] every elect seed.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; They're mine." God is determined [music]
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; to see you through.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; He's the author and finisher of our
[2:31:14] faith.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I I I didn't even get near I
[2:31:18] I'm [music] on page seven of 14 pages.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; So, the only way that the bride
[2:31:34] [snorts]
[2:31:36] can have a ministry
[2:31:39] is for them to activate
[2:31:42] the promises of what is left for the
[2:31:45] bride to do.
[2:31:48] We see what Malachi 4 was to do. We see
[2:31:51] Revelations 10:1. We see the mighty
[2:31:54] angel. We recognize that. [music]
[2:31:57] But what about us?
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; What has this message
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; got to do with you?
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; You are the [music] interpretation.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; You are the message
[2:32:13] that God says, "I'm choosing a bride."
[2:32:16] Yeah. Who me? Mhm.
[2:32:20] Amen. So let's go beyond our carnal
[2:32:24] thinking.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Go beyond just this [music]
[2:32:28] understanding
[2:32:29] of well
[2:32:32] sent a prophet
[2:32:36] a and you can activate that
[2:32:39] all the time. God sent a prophet.
[2:32:41] Hallelujah. He was a voice. Ah amen.
[2:32:44] He'll let you sit there and do that and
[2:32:45] reiterate that and claim that as a
[2:32:48] promise. But he does not want you
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; to catch the true revelation
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; of the two spirits
[2:32:58] within
[2:33:00] the framework of the church.
[2:33:02] And even
[2:33:18] my position.
[2:33:20] [music]
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Is that clear?
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; So
[2:33:31] I want
[2:33:34] I want my inheritance.
[2:33:36] He said
[2:33:38] that last bride
[2:33:42] under her messenger.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Say what he says.
[2:33:55] Say what the Bible says.
[2:33:58] love about brother Brandon when he
[2:34:00] preaches the sermon the absolute he said
[2:34:02] the word of God that's our thumb that is
[2:34:05] our absolute
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; and the reason that we can make the
[2:34:10] message of the hour an absolute is
[2:34:12] because the word was his absolute
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; sing
[2:34:22] of what we didn't know
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; huh there are certain things there. They
[2:34:28] said, even the Apostle Paul said, "I
[2:34:30] don't know. This is just I Paul. This
[2:34:32] isn't the Lord." When they asked Brother
[2:34:35] Brennham, "Uh, what about a woman
[2:34:36] wearing pajamas [music] or uh a night
[2:34:40] gown?"
[2:34:41] He said, "Did I read that right?"
[2:34:46] He [music] says, "I don't know. I got no
[2:34:50] thus sayaith the Lord. You shall not
[2:34:52] have have
[2:34:54] footies
[2:34:56] and a pair of pants and a shirt and call
[2:34:59] that your pajamas. You [music] know, we
[2:35:01] had them as little boys, you know, had
[2:35:03] the little foot in and we would slide
[2:35:05] down the hallway. We'd run.
[2:35:08] And they asked Brother Brandon, "Well,
[2:35:09] what about a woman? Can she wear pajamas
[2:35:12] or is it better?"
[2:35:14] He said, "I don't No, I ain't got no. He
[2:35:17] said, "I think you look better in a
[2:35:18] night gown."
[2:35:21] [music]
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; And maybe you wear your pajamas and you
[2:35:23] got your little footies.
[2:35:25] That's okay. I'm not I'm going to tell
[2:35:27] you what he said.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; You love him today.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; I know you do.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's why you're here.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; You all are rugged people. You've been
[2:35:39] through so much. [music]
[2:35:41] You've seen so many ones come in here

[2:49:21] How many feel fed in your spirit today?
[2:49:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's all [music]
[2:49:25] just bow our heads.
[2:49:30] Heavenly Father,
[2:49:32] Lord, we thank you, Lord, for the spirit
[2:49:34] of God in this church. Lord, we thank
[2:49:37] you, Father.
[2:49:40] Lord, your prophet promised, Lord, that
[2:49:42] there would be a bride, Lord, and it
[2:49:45] wouldn't just be
[2:49:47] a bride as a group, but it would be an
[2:49:49] individual church of God, Lord. Lord,
[2:49:53] you said through your prophet that every
[2:49:55] one of us has a purpose, Father.
[2:49:58] And Lord, from our heart's desire,
[2:50:00] Father,
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; I pray that we would all find our
[2:50:04] purpose, Lord, in the bride of Christ.
[2:50:07] Lord, as a new year comes, Lord, I pray,
[2:50:10] Father, that we would purpose. Lord, as
[2:50:12] brother Brennham said at the end of the
[2:50:14] year, he said, "I want to consecrate my
[2:50:16] life a new." Father, I pray that each
[2:50:19] one of us, Lord,
[2:50:22] Lord, that we would find a level of
[2:50:24] consecration before you, Father. Lord, I
[2:50:27] pray that this year, Father, we would
[2:50:29] find a level, Lord, that we want to
[2:50:31] ascend into the heights of the
[2:50:33] supernatural. Father, I pray Lord Jesus
[2:50:36] that your church, Father, would keep in
[2:50:38] revival in this day. Father, I pray that
[2:50:41] each one of us, Lord, from the deacon at
[2:50:43] the back, Father, to the song leader to
[2:50:45] the pastor, Father, Lord, I pray that
[2:50:48] your church would find their position,
[2:50:50] Lord Jesus. Lord, there's young people
[2:50:52] that are looking, Lord, and they don't
[2:50:54] understand which group, Lord, and they
[2:50:56] don't know why this man's fighting this
[2:50:57] man, and they don't understand why that
[2:51:00] these things are happening, Lord, in our
[2:51:01] midst as the message believers. But
[2:51:03] father, I pray that you would shine your
[2:51:05] light in our midst. Father, Lord, I pray
[2:51:08] that you would break the bondage of the
[2:51:09] enemy that would bring confusion.
[2:51:11] Father, I pray that your Holy Spirit
[2:51:13] would come upon your church, Father, in
[2:51:15] a mighty way, Lord. Lord, as you
[2:51:17] promised through the prophet Joel, I
[2:51:19] will restore, sayeth the Lord, all the
[2:51:21] Palmerworm and the cankerworm and the
[2:51:23] locust had taken from your church. But,
[2:51:25] Father, you promised that you would
[2:51:27] restore your church, your bride in the
[2:51:30] state.
[2:51:31] Father, bless your people as we go. May
[2:51:34] we go with zeal and passion, Lord Jesus.
[2:51:36] Thank you for our pastor, Brother Ron.
[2:51:38] Lord, pouring out his heart, Lord Jesus.
[2:51:41] Lord, he's seen seen so many years of
[2:51:43] confusion in groups come and go, Father.
[2:51:46] I pray, Lord, as the message was
[2:51:47] preached, Lord, let us say what the tape
[2:51:50] say, Father. Lord, and let us not just
[2:51:53] say it, but let us do it, Father. Let us
[2:51:55] not just play a mechanical device,
[2:51:57] Father, but let us do what the voice of
[2:52:00] Revelation 10:7 says to do in this day.
[2:52:03] &gt;&gt; Bless your people now, Lord. We know
[2:52:06] that the rapture is minutes away, hours
[2:52:09] away. Father, let us all be ready.
[2:52:11] Father, we just commit our lives, our
[2:52:14] hearts,
[2:52:15] &gt;&gt; our very existence to you. [music]
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray.
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today. Thank you for
[2:52:25] coming to the house of the Lord today.
[2:52:27] May God bless your week, the rest of
[2:52:29] this week. Remember the service
[2:52:30] Wednesday night, Lord willing, brother
[2:52:32] Steve Clar will be speaking for us. God
[2:52:33] bless you. Have a blessed day today. God
[2:52:35] bless you.
