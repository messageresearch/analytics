changing his mask Hallelujah yeah I don't mean to preach but I feel good I'll tell you what now I I'm gonna do a couple announcements and I want all of you to listen very carefully the Lord willing we are going to have our youth camp this year up in Tonto Rim we have went ahead and told them they have uh tentatively said it yes you have the time here are the dates this is July 27th end of July that's a Thursday through Sunday Thursday July 27th through July 30th we will give you more information they have already said yes you have it it's been reserved we haven't got the contract yet you never have anything until something's in writing you can have a verbal but we want to make sure they've already they uh got back to me today I left him a voicemail uh and they sent me and I got a voicemail from them they said yes they're going to be sending it to brother Robert and we can have we have to guarantee at least 150 minimum uh people campers Youth and up to 200 so we'll have to see depending on uh if we can if we have 25 counselors and that means we can only have 175 of the use so we'll we'll see we can play with that number we bit um our anniversary meetings anniversary meetings are going to be uh April 14 15 and 16. okay that's a Friday Saturday Sunday this is our anniversary meetings what is Easter's day what is the date for Easter this year April what 9th people are saying oh you're doing it on Easter no it's not Easter weekend it's a weekend after Easter everybody got it say I got it all right no excuse you know it's the week after Easter that way we're not in infringing on others that have always had an Easter meeting or an Easter camp or whatever now we will have a a an Easter Service here for sure yes you bet Sunday morning we're going to have us a Time but our anniversary meetings will be April 14 15 and 16. because in March we always had a problem with spring training everybody's in town uh as you know because of the baseball season it's hard to get a motel and if you can get a motel it's twice the price Etc and and uh so we thought well let's just do it into April and we'll have beautiful weather at that time also now I have got some CDs these are made this is called Big stories for little ears this is made by Josh and Anne love all it's a little podcast that they put together a reenactment of Jonah and a whale Noah's Ark and the flood and Sister Ann Reed some of the scripture and then the children acted out it's fantastic I went ahead now these are ten dollars each and I went ahead and I've paid for 20 already or I will brother Robert I'm gonna have you I got the note in the back there so he's my right hand man but what we'll do in order so that sister Carolyn and the different ones that there uh don't have to do it in their books and take the money and this will be on the honor System honor System that means if they're in the back we've got about 18 of them back there with the brother now uh and if you want one go ahead and take it and then you can put ten dollars in the offering is that fair enough we'll let your conscience okay the honor System because that way the sisters okay they paid me and they hold it and they wait and give it to Ann when we're out of these we'll get more okay so it's really really good and uh you know uh I believe it'll be a real blessing to those especially if you've got young children they will absolutely love to hear these children do that and so it's uh it's definitely something that you should look into um and also an update on brother William Silva's people are asking what about it what you know tomorrow is a date for the lawyers to go before the judge we've sent about I believe if I'm correct about 4 500 US dollars so far to go ahead and get the lawyer for him uh now you all know brother Ernesto Marine there in Monclova Mont Clovis he's a pastor down there he's been here he's preached for us I've gone down there and preached in Mexico he used to work for the governor of his Province so he knows a lot of powerful people in the government and when I contacted him within 15 minutes he said brother Ron I've got a lawyer for you and I know what to do and she's good and she's a Christian etc etc and we've went ahead and he's kind of our middle man to go ahead and handle the things there in in Mexico for us so tomorrow the Lord willing I'd like you guys to remember them in prayer uh they've set the bond at 20 000 pesos that's about eleven hundred dollars we've already sent the money for the bond they're going to pay the bond tomorrow we will find out some people are saying brother Ron uh brother Austin Johnson has had a bunch of people asking he's got a GoFundMe page already ready to launch if we need it okay but you don't want to just start throwing money at something until you know you know um we don't know the expenses we don't know what they're going to find um I and we don't know so we will keep you informed and once we know then we'll probably uh either do a PayPal on our website or we'll do it with uh brother Austin to go ahead and put up a GoFundMe page but we'll keep you informed but tomorrow is a very important meeting it's the first time I think that he's gone before the judge and um so uh let's just keep that as a matter of Prayer and uh so that is all that I have on uh on my announcements of what I wanted to say to all of you so keep those dates ready we will inform you now I've had some of the youth leaders some of my sound technicians and different ones said brother Ron we would like to go and look at the camp at potonto rim to see what what all we need to go look and just get an an idea of uh now so we've got plenty of time we'll look at March April maybe May or whatever to go ahead and go up there and what I'll do is I'll get a bunch of Brothers uh it'll be just some brothers I'll probably take my truck or whatever and we'll all go up together if we have to take a couple cars we will but that way they can go and get a first hand look of what they need for sound and that sort of thing look at the fields look at the gymnasium and look at all of the things that they have there at Camp so

give this portion of this service into your hands and we ask that you would have your way Lord in Jesus Christ then amen amen God bless you this evening we welcome you in the name of the Lord and it's good to be in the house of the Lord is it not amen turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of John chapter 4 and we'll read verses 9 through 24. amen we pray that the Lord will have his way tonight amen amen John chapter 4. verses 9. through 24 and it says then saith the woman of Samaria onto him how is it that thou being a Jew asketh drink of me which I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewst the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink that would have asked of him and he would have given thee water the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from when Stan has thou Living Waters are dealt greater than our father Jacob which give us the well and drink thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst thank you Lord the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water I could say that we would all be in agreement tonight sir give me this water this is the kind of water that I want to partake of that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus saith onto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou has is not thy husband in that sadist thou truly the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship and Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor at Jerusalem notice he's taken away these locations that these people are holding on to he's saying neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem uh uh not yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye no not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the our cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen you may take your seats this evening [Music] I would like to continue on with this thought this evening of true worship and this is part 11 and I would like to take for the subject in spirit and in truth in spirit and in truth so we pick up our story this evening with a very familiar portion of scripture and we know that brother Branham would use this scripture many times within his ministry either when he was preaching or whenever he was praying for the sick and he would do this with a purpose in mind and that purpose would be that the people would realize that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that if Jesus did something within the scriptures that it wouldn't be a far out thing that if he was doing it in this hour day and so here he would he would have somebody come before him and he would say no here is a woman and I am a man and I don't know the needs that is upon your heart I have never met you before is that true and they would hold up their hand and they would say that that that's true and he would say this is uh uh something that has already happened within the scriptures and he would rehearse this scripture so that the people would notice and say my God is doing the exact same thing in this hour day with a Divine gift of God just like he did in Bible times all right and so we realized that uh that this part of brother branham's Ministry was given to him in the second pool of his ministry and now he was backing up his ministry with scriptural examples and so we realized that the that a prophet will always bring us back to the word that's why I love this message it's not something that a man uh on a far a far out country and he and and he had a dream and he did this and he did that and he was all by himself and there was no accountability there was no one else to see it uh it was just his word and his word only but brother Branham now he would take these examples he would share things he would give scriptural examples and and and and and and uh all of it would be scripturally based that's why I put my trust in this message because it's not something that's far out it's scripturally based which is our absolute now within this portion of scripture we can see there's there's many points of reading and many things that we could pull out of it um and expound on but I would like to speak on like I've already said on what it means to worship God in spirit and in truth because the Bible says that God is seeking man that he might worship Him it's God that's doing the seeking he's not just seeking for a for a little bit of uh uh raising our hands once in a while and a little bit of singing a little bit of worship no he wants us to worship him in a peculiar way in spirit and in truth you can't have the one without the other it's not accepted in God's mind but so what's he doing in this end time now he's seeking those how many of you can say I'm one of those I'm one of those that He sought after I'm one of those who he caught in this end time sure so now we we can read in our Bibles in verse 20 and it says of John chapter 4 and it was the woman here speaking and she says our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship and so we we find out from this portion of scripture that there was two different uh ways of thinking between the Samaritans and the Jews the Samaritan's way of thinking was that here upon this mountain where our father Jacob dug this whale and and it has a lot of history in this place and it's a magnificent place where God did many wonderful things uh it's at this very place where we are taught where we have to worship God and outside of this mountain there's not a true worship of God and here you have the Jews point of view and they're saying hey Jerusalem is the place the Jerusalem is the place where we ought to worship God outside of Jerusalem guess what there's no true worship the Samaritans believed that on the mountain of uh girizim was the chosen place of worship by God the Samaritans believed that it was on this Mount where the blessings of God was to be um and we find that that is derived from Deuteronomy 11 and verse 29 and it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God hath brought thee in onto the land whether thou goest to possess it that thou shalt put the blessing upon Mount gurism jerism I don't know how you pronounce it and the curse upon Mount EBA and so we all are very familiar that the Samaritans are half-jews and they're half gentiles and so at one point though they were all Israelites they were all Jews they were all part of the same crowd that came out of Egypt that crossed the Red Sea that they were with God and and God did many mighty Works before their very eyes but when they crossed over into this promised land is where things now begin to change some seen it this way and another seen it that way and now little doctrines begin to form I see it this way and and I see it that way and well I'm gonna go with this guy because I see it like him well if we just say it at how the scripture says it there will be no divisions it was upon this mountain that the Samaritans built an altar it was kind of interesting as I was uh studying on this today that uh the Samaritans even built a temple upon this mountain now this mountain was 10 miles north of Jerusalem and it was the very first place where they went and uh there was many things happened on this on this mountain this gurism jurism mountain how do you say it somebody help me out here who did phonograms in school ISM okay I found out that I don't really know how to read correctly my kids they learned through phonograms I learned by memorize oh yeah it's not the right way to learn how to read and so we even find out that they had a a temple because they wanted to have a temple at the same time when the second temple when Jerusalem had their Temple and it's just very interesting because uh according to the histories there was a a Jewish priest that actually went up to this Temple and he destroyed it because true worship is only in Jerusalem and so he got us I don't know what happened he took off his religious coats he took off these different things and he turned into a vandal and he destroyed this Temple isn't it so funny how very quickly our our Christian views and our Christian beliefs and our Christian lives and uh our their righteousness that we pretend to put on so many times can very easily come off when people don't agree with us come on come on come on it's so true oh yeah I'm a Believer and I'm a Christian and then once in a while somebody gets on the wrong side of you and my goodness where did this guy come from yeah he's not sitting in church so he doesn't have his Halo on God help us yes so we find out that this mountain or this place of worship for the Samaritans it was uh it was a place of contention between the Jews and the Samaritans and so much that a Jew would never pass through a Samaritan City they despised each other so much that a Jewish man if he had to pass through the way of Samaria he would go a longer way to go around the city because they didn't want to be in the company with a Samaritan but the Bible says and he must needs go through Samaria no doubt when the when the disciples saw that Jesus was going through Samaria they wondered why is he going through this city why is he going in with the people of Samaria doesn't he know that they're a sinful people and there's contentions between us for hundreds or thousands of years doesn't he understand this why is he going that way because there was a seed of God there was somebody that needed to hear the word of God and God does the exact same thing with you and I sometimes he must needs come pass our way it doesn't matter where we are it doesn't matter where we were when we were Sinners but Jesus had a purpose one time to come past our way like brother James said he has an appointment with every one of us there was a need there was a purpose because there was a woman with a desire in her hearts in her heart hallelujah thank you Lord so the Jews we know that they obviously believe that in Jerusalem was the provided place of worship and that was the only provided place of worship in 1965 God's chosen place of worship brother Branham says there is only one place that God puts his name and that's not in a church but it's in Jesus there is only one place of worship only one place that you were received and that is in the Beloved Jesus Christ there is not another name given under Heaven given among men whereby be saved no church no Creed no nothing Jesus Christ that's why we must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because there's no other name that is greater it is the greatest name that was ever spoke upon mortal lips I I found it very uh enlightening when brother meno was preaching on Sunday and he's giving his testimony I don't know about you but I could sit and I could listen to an elder give his testimony like that all day it's fascinating and here he was and he's and he's telling us yeah uh we're gonna go and we're going to get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and and for us we're like yeah that's normal sure we've heard that for years that that's that's a simple Revelation for us yes 60 years down the line and so when you put yourself in their shoes why do we think brother Branham and almost all of his sermons he always hits on it you've got to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if you've been baptized in another way you need to be re-baptized because at the time in which they were living in that's what was being preached Father Son and Holy Ghost and so now here was a prophet on the scene and the prophet and the word always corrects the error of the hour and so we stand time and time again every church he goes to and it's in the name of Jesus Christ it's not the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost so now here you have a first generation message believer and the word now is being unfolded and unfolded as as they walk in the word and and brother manno you know what uh they go and they get baptized and everything and they go back to their little village well now they're all having a prayer meeting did you catch that why do you pray for somebody if they got an evil spirit or there's something wrong with them they thought what's wrong with you man he got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not the correct way it would be like us going somewhere and coming back I think uh uh brother Tim had mentioned it on Sunday when we were fellowshipping brother Tim Hofer and he said it's like us going somewhere else and coming back to church and coming amongst the Brethren and saying oh praise the Lord I got baptized in the nidals in the titles of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost and I feel regenerated he'd be like let's hold a prayer meeting brother Stephen needs prayer he's off the word that's what they were thinking but when something it doesn't matter what the village was saying or what his dad was saying even though he was a young man when the word was being revealed it doesn't matter what anybody else says or does I found it fascinating yeah we got it too easy you know why because everybody agrees with us oh yeah it's true you ever tried to talk with somebody that doesn't agree with you it's hard and keep in the right spirit and having Fellowship takes a god it takes a christ-like character amen it sure does amen so we find out that God's provided a place of worship it is not a geographical location it is not in Jefferson Jeffersonville Indiana like some people want to make us think it's not in Arizona as some thought it was but universally it's in one place and that's in Christ Jesus it's not in a peculiar location Jesus did away with that he said it's not in this mountain nor is it in Jerusalem but it's in a person Hallelujah and that's the person that we need to get into is Christ Jesus and when we get in Christ Jesus now we can fellowship with him and worship by spirit and in truth notice this it's very interesting brother Bradham said questions and answers brother Branham I have some questions I wish to ask you I have heard people say that you have advised uh he says maybe I'd better leave that one alone too let's see well it's already time to quit maybe we'll uh he continues on he says I have heard people say that you have advised people to sell all their homes and follow you to Arizona or they would not be in the Rapture is this true that's a lie see uh-huh or should we sell our homes or did you even say this no sir isn't it amazing how something could be said and as it travels down this person well this person said that this person said and this person said that he said and before you know it it's so far out left field he said that's a lie remember remember Junie Jackson's dream that time when I went out there Journey dreamed that he saw how many remembers the dream and how the lord gave the interpretation the great Mountain he we was standing upon it and old washed out letters there and I was trying to interpret and I couldn't I was interpreting it to them after I got it it all interpreted all of it interpreted then I reached over and and got this in this dream now and some kind of a like a bar and just cut the top of the mountain off and looked in there and it was all Snow White like marble but it wasn't written on and I said you all stay here and look in on this now while I go younger what was he trying to tell them he was saying no you remember the dream that was given I have to go to Arizona I have a purpose for going to Arizona but you stay here and you look on this but everybody when you when you look this up there's like five six questions in a row brother Brown was just pulling them out did you say we have to move to Arizona did you say we have to move did you say no no no I didn't say that it's a lie but it was on the people's hearts why was it on the people's hearts because somebody was telling them that that's what he said now what am I getting to I'm getting to it's not a particular location remember the time when the person came to Jeffersonville and they and they were all excited and they said uh I'm coming to Jeffersonville because I want to make the Rapture well this guy he didn't know he was talking to brother Branham and it was something about uh uh where's the bridge in Jeffersonville because we go to the bridge in Jeffersonville the Raptor's going to take place and so on and so forth says the Raptor's not going to take place in Jeffersonville he said he took him into his house and he explained it to him and he he all know the story so it's not in Jeffersonville it's not in Arizona but it is in a place and that's Christ Jesus Hallelujah foreign now the scripture says I don't have where it is here I just have the verse it says it's talking on the Rapture and says I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left to man shall be in the field that one shall be taken the other left and they answered and said unto him where Lord you see the wondering of this location where is this location and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the Eagles be gathered together so what does he stand there there'll be two sleeping because it's night time and it's time to sleep and there will be two that are grinding in the field what is the scripture trying to show us as trying to show us that the Rapture is a universal process it's not just for those of us within America it's not just for the ones and I forget but it's a universal thing this message is a universal message that has went around the world to gather the elected lady the Bride of Jesus Christ and it is calling her out of every Kindred Tongan nation and is calling her out of every denomination it is calling her out of every place every tongue it doesn't matter what color of skin they have it doesn't matter where they live on this planet Earth but the word of God is calling her and is calling her for a purpose and that purpose is to prepare her for a rapture so if the message is universal what is it showing us there will be two sleeping there will be two in the field and I'll take one it's not a location right because if it was a location say if it wasn't Czechoslovakia well that doesn't seem good for us in America we're in trouble I'm glad that it's not something of a natural man but it's something that is very spiritual and Supernatural even they were asking the Lord where is this place Lord there's only one place that we need to be in and that's in Christ Jesus for the Bible says for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and that's how you get into that body is by a baptism of fire that seals us to the day of our Redemption now Jesus said God is seeking for those who will worship Him in spirit and in truth Hallelujah John chapter 14 and verse 6 it says Jesus saith unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me because we can say well what is truth Lord there's over 900 denominations there's many different message churches where is the truth Lord he said I am the truth and what is Christ he is the the word that was made flesh and so what is it now that we're depending on as the revealed word of the hour to us personally that's why we can say with the prophet that we are feeding this evening on the unfailing body word of the son of man you notice it says brother Branham said the unfailing we always think of the body word of the son of man the embody word sure it's the body word of the son of man but it's the unfailing the unfailing body word this word of God has never failed us and has never failed and through seven Church ages it has never failed from Genesis to Revelations why because God is unfailing and he never did fail and he never will fail so put your trust in the unfailing body word of the son of man yes sir we will fail him and we will fail each other but he will never fail us this message this message is the revealed word for this day it is the unfailing body word of Jesus Christ and it has brought us back into fellowship and communion with God almighty you say what's the purpose of all this what's the what's the purpose of all this brother Branham and brother brannelman her brother Randleman ah there's a purpose behind it what is God trying to do he is trying to bring us back into Fellowship back into communion with him once again and I can say it's working it's worked in the history of my life it's working now and it's going to continue working why because I'm a work in process amen so we realize that Jesus said take eat for this is my body what are we talking about we're talking about communion take eat for this is my body and and what did he do when he presented the the bread before the before his disciples he broke it take eat understand you cannot break this word yourself you cannot understand this word yourself the only way that we can understand the Bible that we can understand the message is when the Holy Spirit begins to uh break the bread before our very eyes I say Lord break the bread let us have communion Lord open my eyes of understanding father he's in here take this bread it's a type of my body that's going to be broken Take and Eat It he said here is this wine it's a representation of My Blood so now we're getting into worshiping in spirit and in truth because what is the bread of life it is the word of God and what is the wine that is a type of a a stimulation by revelation without feeding on the unfailing body word of Jesus Christ you will never be stimulated by Revelation by the Holy Spirit or the wine of God right if you're not feeding on it you'll never be stimulated by it but when you're feeding on it on a daily basis we take communion uh maybe two three times a year that's not that's that's okay within the church and the assembly but as an individual we ought to be having communion with God why because we have an open book we have the bread that's before us we have the wine that's before us so why not partake of it here it is partake of it I'm going to give it to you all you got to do is eat it all you got to do is get into it all you got to do is listen to the message it's part of having that communion with God Hallelujah but if you're not partaking of it when life gets so busy and we got a million things that's going on hey how many of you got extra time in your hands nobody but when something is very important to you when something is special to you when something really means something to you it doesn't matter how busy you are you will make time for it so you might say well I'm too busy and I'm caught up yeah who's not make time for it if this word is special to you if God has done something for you in your life we ought to make time for God you've got to be coming yes sir so what happens now when we begin to feed upon this word we become the word you say well I'm not seeing the change in my life that I ought to be seeing uh it's got to be the ministry who else better to blame than the ministry it's his fault he's not preaching it right and I'm not getting Revelation from his ministry it's not good enough it's not deep enough on and on yeah well what about your own personal life I'll be the first one to stand up and say I'm not the greatest preacher I know I'm not the deepest that's okay I am who I am but what are you doing in your own personal life it's time for us to really start feasting on this thing man you say well I've been feasting for years and I'm full nonsense you're just getting lazy get out and walk a little bit if you've been eating too much go for a little bit of a walk you'll want to eat a little bit more when you get back walk with God you feel that you're too full you're getting burned out get along with God and walk with them it'll make you want more amen communion with God is on a daily basis not just three times a year taking communion Hallelujah be encouraged what am I trying to do I'm trying to provoke you to Good Works I'm trying to provoke you and say hey chances are 99 of us aren't communing with God like we should be notice I put myself in there too sure sometimes you get to preaching like oh my goodness Lord is really stomping all over my toes and that's okay because I'll take it home and I'll take it to heart so Jesus said take and eat this bread take this thing and partake of it how do I partake of a book you read it spiritually speaking I'm going to eat a little bit every day you know they you know they say uh uh you shouldn't eat like three big meals a day eat a big breakfast big lunch big dinner well then you can't sleep at night because you eat a big dinner and anybody ever done it sure you have weird dreams feed something spicy my parents used to tell me can I have a string cheese mom no son I'll give you nightmares well she just didn't want me eating it right my mom and dad told me so many lies that I believed oh bless their hearts huh you don't need to sit down and partake of the whole book of Isaiah in one sitting you'll wear yourself out your eyes will begin to cross and you'll forget what you read why because you're too full and you can't contain any more but if you eat a little bit at each at each meal if we eat five or six little meals instead of eating three big meals guess what will be a spiritual machine amen John 4 verse 24 says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth I begin to thinking on worshiping God and spirit and because we've already touched on uh worshiping God in in truth and as message Believers I I believe we have that down pretty good yeah it's easy for us to to worship God in truth because we believe we're walking in truth we're walking we're walking in the light as he is in the light and this truth and this word is unfolding to us but now when we begin to walk in the spirit it's uh how do we how do we how do we worship God in spirit what happens when we worship God in spirit and so I began to think about it and I immediately thought uh I immediately thought about worshiping God in Spirit uh like um like John like John the Revelator you remember in the Book of Revelation chapter 1 verse 10 and it says and I was in the spirit in the Lord's day now when I begin to think about that I thought it was um very interesting because John didn't wait until the Lord's day to get into the spirit now we realize the day of the Lord It's The End time and that's when God was revealing these things to him but let me just break this down in Simplicity for us that John didn't wait to go to church to get in the spirit but he was already in the spirit on the Lord's day when he went to church and because he was already in the spirit when he went to church and he gathered together by the Believers I'm talking about you and I now God began to reveal things to him that he had never seen before and too much of the time we as uh Believers and in our carnality and different things we want to come to church we and we want to we want the song leader to get us into the spirit we want the preacher to get it get us into the spirit we want the people beside us to get us into the spirit God just let me get in the spirit before I leave because I really want to hear something from you Because unless we're in the spirit of God God can't speak to our hearts well just about the time you get relaxed and you get into the service you begin to get into the spirit guess what the service is over but now if we as believers would get into the spirit of God before we got to the assembly I believe that God would speak to our hearts way more than he ever has in Times Gone by he was already in the spirit well how do you get in the spirit you could sing a song everybody's different you could say a prayer you could take your family before you get into the car instead of rush rush rush let's go hey let's take 30 seconds let's calm our Spirits at home let's settle ourselves a little bit so that when we're on our way to church guess what our spirit we're already working on getting into the spirit let's get to church 30 minutes early if we can let's sit and let's meditate let's get in the spirit that when the word Goes Forth it'll have an effect in our lives Hallelujah so John was in the spirit he came to church already in the spirit God help us I wanna I wanna uh I'll just say provoke you once again throw something out there Sunday morning take this to Heart come to church in the spirit come to church with your spirit already settled the things of home and the cares of life and everything leave it at home because when we leave the building it's still going to be there but while we're here let's meditate on the things of God that our hearts and our Spirits are ready to receive from God so Sunday morning I want you to get up 30 minutes earlier I want you to get ready 30 minutes earlier well we're usually at church by um we're usually here about 9 18. Sunday schools are Sunday singing starts at 9 20. we're two minutes early we're making it praise the Lord I want to be here at nine sure so I'm gonna get up 30 minutes earlier you're going to get up 30 minutes earlier you're going to get ready 30 minutes you're going to be ready earlier than you've ever been ready why because you have this desire in your heart that you want to be in the spirit by the time the word is being preached who wants to do it with me hold yourselves accountable you're all going to be waiting here for me aren't you nine o'clock I do this all the time I shouldn't do this stuff to myself I like to do stuff with other people so let's do it together you say I can't do it don't give me your excuse I got five kids eight years old and younger absolutely I know all about it but if you do it and you get here early guess what the holy spirit will move and there won't be such a uh a barrier there won't be such a barrier because you know what our carnal man does our carnal man causes a barrier between us and God it's this guy and it's a barrier did you know that you are not a human being on a spiritual journey you are a spiritual being trapped in a human body on an Earthly Journey but this thing gets in our way it makes excuses and it's a barrier between us and God but if we can get rid of this barrier once in a while and if we can bring it under the subjection to the Holy Spirit God will really move amen amen okay nine o'clock now so I began to think on revivals and I began to think on what does it mean to have a Revival what does it mean to be in Revival what happens when a person or a church is in Revival I think it's very sensible questions that we can ask ourselves about worshiping God and spirit and in truth because when I think of worshiping God and spirit I think of revivals I think of uh the 1950s and the 1960s when there was the speaking in tongues and and the different gifts and the manifestations of this spirit and I begin to think of dancing in the spirit and and all these different uh outward emotions that we can go through when it seems like a person is in Revival and so I thought well sure that can be part of a person being in Revival that could be part of a church that perhaps is being in a Revival and and so you can't help when you think about revivals uh thinking about the Welsh Revival and brother Branham says there was these uh two clergy men I'll just read the I have the the thing here I'll just read it trying to do God a service without it being his will he says it was said that some noble man from the church nobleman went over to Wales to understand or figure out what all the mechanics was in the Revival during their Welsh Revival and when they got off the ship with all their tall hats and their their round collar you know he's talking about round collar this white thing here everybody knows and I'm a preacher I think I should get a white collar and wear it so everybody knows everybody should know by our lives and our testimony another round caller scene coming down the street a little policeman swinging his little Club around like that and whistling they said my good man could you tell me where the Welsh Revival is then he said yes my brethren you're standing in the middle of it uh-huh he said you understand I am the Welsh Revival because the Welsh Revival is in me so every word that that little policeman went whether he was directing traffic on the street that's where their Welsh Revival was when he got into his police car that's where the Welsh Revival was when he went home to his family that's where the whale survival was it wasn't in a certain location but everywhere he went that location had a Revival because he was bringing the Revival with him because he was in Revival these clergy men went to Wales looking for a Revival because they weren't in Revival themselves they were looking for a a physical location to go to and to visit and say if I can just go there I'll be in the Revival they might be with people who are in Revival but if they don't have the Revival in their own hearts if they're not revived themselves Hallelujah it's not a location well we could go from this revival to that Revival and from this place and think well well this one's got it and that one's got it no it doesn't matter if you go there if you don't got it you see what I'm saying but you've got to be in Revival yourself and when you're in Revival it doesn't matter if no one else within the assembly is in Revival or not it doesn't matter what anybody thinks because you know you've been you've been drinking on that that that that uh whale of water that is Flowing up within you and you're not thirsting for the things of the world anymore Lord I'm thirsting for you that's why I'm in Revival because I've been drinking from you that's why I'm in a Revival because I've been eating all the unfailing body word of Jesus Christ so it doesn't matter about anybody else you might be the one that Sparks it in somebody else's life sure you know what a little spark does and a bunch of dry grass starts a fire you know what a little spark will do in your life around somebody that seems that's going through a little dry spot in their life he'll cause a fire that is unquenching the bull that cannot be put out amen everywhere he go everywhere that little man went guess what he was in Revival what about you and I it's a Revival within us that everywhere we go hey guess what the Phoenix Revival it ain't over why because I'm right here amongst you so I began to keep thinking on this on revivals and so I looked up with brother Branham said about it the identification of Christ in all ages and he said now a Revival isn't exactly adding new members to the church he said a Revival is Reviving that what you've already got so we understand that as human beings we can get cold we can get starchy we can get indifferent but when a Revival comes guess what it revives that which God had already given to us he said a Revival is driving what you got and he says and sometimes I've wondered what a Revival is for here's the prophet of God I've wandered 1964. I've wondered what a Revival is for this may sound a little strange for a stranger to you to say this but I was standing by the Lakeshore one day in Lake Michigan I was watching the waves how they come in and went out and they would leap oh it was it was Heavy Winds of blowing and the waves would Dash way in the air and churn up and down and roll in and come back and roll in again and I thought my what a Revival so here he is he's he's looking at the things that catches your attention right off the bat wow what a Revival the waves are crashing the waters are churning my goodness this is amazing how wonderful I've never seen something as good as this keep reading it can begin to roll in and roll I said my what a Revival but you know there is no more in water in that Lake than it is when it's perfectly normal and quiet that's right you know there's no less Holy Spirit in your life when you're sitting humble and quiet in an assembly then when the holy spirit moves and you get all excited that's what he's saying here he's saying there's no more water in it it's just acting differently but it doesn't make it any different or any better watch what uh that's right it's got the same amount of water see then I wonder why is that Lake all stirred up just the same as we get stirred up in a Revival we turn around you know um you know what it always does to the lake though it cleans it it washes all the trash out on the bank so that's why we have to have a Revival for not for the churning of the waves and the crashing and the great wonderful things that we're seeing out in the ocean but we're having a Revival to get the trash out he said that's what a Revival is for is to take the trash that was within that body of sea and to push it to the shore amen good he said that's why we have to have a Revival oh brother Stephen you're saying a Revival what are you talking about are you talking about the churning and the twisting and and the praising the God and the hallelujahs that might happen but uh what I'm really talking about is getting the trash out of our lives Revival that's what a Revival is for get all the unbelief and things away from us so we can see more clear of what God wants for us that's what we're anticipating this time as a Revival among the people what kind of a Revival among the people a Revival of getting the trash out of our lives so understand that we are a body of water let me type us as the ocean or as Lake Michigan and there's trash and all these different things that's within that I got to thinking about this that was within the the Lake Michigan the lake never put that trash in its life it was because of other things outside resources other people whatever it might have been I don't know but somehow or another this pollution and this trash got into the ocean it got into the lake and now God was causing a Revival within the ocean or within the lake what for what purpose to get this trash out of its body of water I say that this is the kind of Revival that we need not just as an assembly but as an individual people we need to have a good old-fashioned sin repenting Revival that this that the trash that is built up deep within this ocean of body that the holy spirit will move and it gets kicked out to the shore that's what we need in our lives and that'll produce the joy of the Lord that'll produce a song in your heart that'll produce a spring in your step why there's nothing like a good old repenting and getting things off of your heart to God ain't talking about saying sorry I'm sorry you know we have a cusp we have been raised uh to say I'm sorry oh I'm sorry I hurt your feelings I'm sorry I'm sorry oh you are yep sorry see you're sorry to your brother sorry you're sorry yep you won't do it again promise do it again and they do it again and we do it again we sin again we sin against the Lord again I'm sorry Lord yep sorry sorry I didn't mean to I'm sorry Jesus didn't say say you're sorry and and and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he said repent then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins not your sorry when you're sorry about something you're going to do it again but when we repent of something in our lives we're walking this way I didn't mean to do that Lord I repent and we turn from that evil thing and we walk the other direction so when I say we need a good old-fashioned sin repenting life-changing experience in our lives that's what I'm saying we need to turn from our evil ways stop the nonsense from saying I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't mean to stop saying you're sorry and repent how do I repent stop doing it I wonder who it is amongst us as just continually living in sin and they come to church they feel convicted and they say I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry I wonder who it is amongst us it's that's that's taken the odd drink smoking the odd cigarette living on true to their partners living untrue to their husband untrue to their wives wonder who it is that's living a double life amongst us and every time you come to church you just say I'm sorry you say my brother how can you say this stuff I don't know I'm just saying it and you come to church and you feel bad because there's there's a presence here that's not in your home because your home is filled with sin and then you come to a place that is Sanctified a place that is set apart for the work of the Lord and you feel his presence you say oh my goodness I'm a man of unclean lips I am a man with an unclean heart and an unclean mind Lord I'm sorry but when you leave the presence we go right back to the same sin stop saying you're sorry to God is not mocked and he will not be mocked Hallelujah it's time to repent it's time to make things right it's time to make a 180 degree turn and say Lord I am sorry but I repent I Repent from that life I Repent from watching that stuff I Repent I Repent I won't do it again and give me strength Lord because I'm a weak vessel that when I'm tempted to do those things again you give me the strength to overcome be honest with God and God will help us sorry don't cut it it's not good enough why because typically we don't mean it if you say you're sorry and continue the same way that you're doing treating each other treating those around us treating your kids treating your parents treating your husband your wife yeah I'm sorry I shouldn't have I overreacted I should have yeah you're not you're just sorry it happened but you're not sorry because if you were sorry you wouldn't do it again try using the word repent I repent I Repent I repent for how I spoke to you I repent for how I acted I Repent of that thing it'll change our mindset a little bit because we don't really believe we don't believe in ourselves when we say I'm sorry I repent I repent and I am sorry Hallelujah yes sir as the musicians come when we repent of our sins God is faithful and God is just to forgive us of our sins he is not a God that holds things over us he is not a God that when we approach him the correct way with the right attitude and with a repenting heart he's not here to always remind us of the things that we were doing That's what Satan does but the Bible says that he is just and that he is willing to forgive us of our sins and of our wrongdoings as long as we approach him in the right way and when we have truly repented of those things you remember you remember when you first repented and came to Christ you remember the burden that lifted off of you it was amazing there was like this burden that we were carrying we didn't know what it was and when we came to God and it was a true repentance of of God my God I'm a sinful and I'm a Wretched Man but you if you would have Grace upon me father if you would just show me some mercy I Repent of what I'm doing you remember how it felt you remember the burden that lifted off of you that's what we need to get back to oh Father forgive me of my sins I'm sorry now when you repent you know what it's going to do it's gonna put you in a Revival foreign how can a sinful person that's living on true to the word of God be in a Revival at the same time [Music] can bitter and sweet water come out of the same fountain but when we truly change from our ways and the things that we're doing and those little secret things that we believe that no one sees and perhaps God doesn't even see it when we turn from those things it'll put you on a spiritual Revival the reason being because you're no longer going to be running from God when a man has sin in his life he won't pray he won't read his Bible and he'll be neglecting to go to church why because he's feeling convicted in his heart but when we repent of those things ye know your life and you know the inner things that's within your heart you know the things that you're struggling with you know the things that's going on in your family let the Holy Spirit discern those things my goodness Lord your word is a sharp and a two-edged sword you know what it's doing right now it's cutting it's cutting to the ascenders it's cutting down deep and it's separating the flesh from the spiritual man and when the word of God separates us from our spiritual man it puts our spiritual man in a Revival it gets us back into the word it gets us back into our prayer life it gets us back into being happy to go to church it gets us back into uh wanting to pay your tithes and support the cause it gets you back into the things of God why because the flesh man is being cut away [Music] now what will that produce I don't know we're all different but I know one thing that what it'll produce it'll produce a closer walk with God [Music] it'll produce something that pushes the trash out of our Lives into the seashore [Music] I wonder I wonder if you were to imagine in your mind of an ocean and picture all this trash that's upon the ocean and you think my goodness that ocean is being destroyed by all this trash that beach is being destroyed by all this trash look at it it's disgusting the waters are nice the beach is nice but look at the trash it's nasty it's disgusting I wonder if you were to visualize the beach in your life what would you what would you see on the shores of your life if it was to be [Music] cast out if it was to be removed by the presence of God those things that you're thinking in your mind right now those things that you're visualizing those are the things you need to repent of [Music] Hallelujah foreign [Music] to something within my spirit keeps crying out pretty bad I don't need to scream it I don't need to holler all we need is the Holy Spirit to Quicken it [Music] I don't know who it is or what you got going on [Music] but I'm feeling very sensitive right now to say repent stop this sorryness God doesn't listen to your sorry but he wants you to repent of those things stand and pray together foreign father I thank you for your word I thank you Lord that your word is a two-edged sword father that it cuts and it tears apart the Flesh of man Lord that our spiritual man would be free to worship you in spirit and in truth and father this is our desire that we can worship you that way Lord father I stand in the gap for your children tonight father forgive him of their sins and shortcomings I pray Lord that this little simple sermon cut up as it was Lord would bring forth much fruit in the lives of your children I ask it for your Kingdom's glory in Jesus name amen you know it's not only in a church service where God moves but it's in your car it's when you're at home it's when you're by yourself so much of the time is as Ministry I feel we think that the only place is to to repent is at the altar here in front of everybody else but it's not true because his God is omnipresent and he'll meet you wherever you are at whatever time it is whatever place it is it doesn't have to be a certain geographical location but as long as the heart is sensitive and it means what it is saying that's where God will meet the believer [Music] you can help the trash in our lives brother Stephen what happens next just let go and let God let God have his wonderful way don't try to manufacture something don't try to act some way just because somebody else acted a certain way when they got delivered but be yourself be an individual and when it happens it happens and then you'll be able to give God glory and then after it happens you don't stop there but you fuel the fire you don't take the log that was within the water and try to put it on the fire of the Holy Spirit it'll it'll quench it but you feed the holy spirit with things that burn correctly we feed it with the word we feed it through prayer we feed it through singing we feed it through worship and then next thing you know as an individual you're on fire for God and in the midst of the greatest Revival that you've ever been in and it doesn't matter if anybody else is touched or not but you're touched you're touched when you come to the service you're touched when you leave the service why because the Holy Spirit Revival is within your heart and wherever you go the Revival is with you don't just keep it for the church services amen but let go let's just sing that song one more time let go and let God have his wonderful way his ways are wonderful his ways are unfailing his ways are so much above our ways but when we give ourselves to the ways of God it'll turn our lives upside down the Bible says that the disciples went out and they turned the world upside down in other words it changed the lives of people that they came in contact with and we tell you when you get into the spirit of of of repenting of our sins and turning from those things when we get into a spirit of Revival of kicking the trash out of our Lives when we get into a spirit of worshiping God freely after those things let me tell you just let go let God have his way and it'll turn our lives upside down hey man let's sing this together [Music] your sorrow will that is [Music] [Music] God hell is wonderful way let go and let God have his way [Music] your soul ish your night turn today let go and let God have sing it one more time let go and let God have his wonderful way let go and let God have his way your sorrow will vanish your nights turn today just let go and let God have his work

flows from those you have redeemed we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are but words are not enough to tell you of our love so listen to our hearts [Music] if words could

life thank you for the truth thank you for the way so so as to our hearts hear our Spirits say ing a song of Praise that fools and those you have redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you

from those you have redeemed to [Music] tell you what an awesome God you are when words are not enough to tell you of our love listen to the words are not enough when words are not enough to tell you of our love listen to our heart when the music fades and all is Stripped Away and I simply come [Music] longing just to pray something that's a worth that will bless your heart I'll bring you more
