[50:43] brother Branham said he allows an action
[50:47] to come onto your life to watch your
[50:50] reaction
[50:51] [Music]
[50:56] it's easy to have a smile and a Victory
[51:00] when everything's going good
[51:05] but when you're in the midst of a trial
[51:09] well it seems like a dark cloud is
[51:11] hanging over you it went
[51:23] when you're like job and you say I go
[51:25] forward he's not dare I go backwards
[51:28] I can't behold anymore where is he
[51:31] I want you to understand he is there
[51:34] whether you feel him whether you see him
[51:37] he said I will be with you
[51:41] even in you until the end of the world
[51:45] I believe God's going to speak to
[51:47] somebody this morning
[51:49] I believe I could call your name out
[51:51] right now
[51:54] I do I believe I could call some people
[51:57] out right now that God put it on my
[51:59] heart to let you know that God is
[52:01] mindful
[52:08] of what you're going through
[52:12] you say well I'm going through something
[52:14] nobody knows it and
[52:17] but he knows it
[52:20] and he put it on my heart
[52:23] so if you listen carefully will you
[52:25] listen
[52:26] if God's going to speak will you listen
[52:29] and say father speak to me I have need
[52:32] and oh God I need you
[52:35] in the midst of all of this I need you
[52:38] to come because you're Jehovah Jireh
[52:41] you're a God that provides all of our
[52:45] needs Heavenly Father Lord As I Lay My
[52:48] Hands upon this Sovereign book
[52:51] men of old were
[52:53] were moved of the Holy Ghost they said
[52:56] things father that they did not
[52:58] understand
[53:00] they penned it down
[53:02] not knowing really what it what time who
[53:06] it would be to fulfill it
[53:08] but father that's the Holy Spirit moved
[53:11] upon men of old to write these
[53:14] scriptures then it takes up moving again
[53:17] in our day to have that word come to
[53:21] light to come to fruition that our eyes
[53:24] of understanding would understand what
[53:27] is for our day what is our day what is
[53:31] our message Father because the light
[53:34] that is given to us in this hour is the

[55:13] we go back a long ways with
[55:17] like one brother met me at the airport
[55:19] one time got off the airport there in
[55:21] Frankfurt Germany
[55:23] Brother on
[55:24] we've met before
[55:27] ah I don't know you know I've traveled a
[55:30] little bit Yeah nah man we met before a
[55:33] long time ago
[55:34] I'm racking my mind and well where was
[55:37] it just give me a hint or something like
[55:39] this and he got me all flustered and
[55:41] everything because I don't like to to
[55:43] meet somebody that they recognize me and
[55:46] I don't recognize them and yes we met
[55:48] and everything he said before the
[55:49] foundation of the world
[55:52] ah yeah being late came on you ain't
[55:56] never gonna catch me in that one again
[55:59] go back a long ways
[56:01] each and every one welcome you all in
[56:03] the name of the Lord
[56:05] may God bless his word this morning to
[56:08] our hearts second Samuel are you there
[56:09] chapter 22.
[56:12] second Samuel 22 verses 29 through 31.
[56:17] for thou art my lamp O Lord and the Lord
[56:21] will lighten my darkness
[56:24] for by Thee I have run through a troop
[56:27] and by my God have I leaped over a wall
[56:32] as for God his way is perfect
[56:37] the way of the Lord is tried he is a
[56:40] buckler to all them that trust in him
[56:44] for who is God save the Lord
[56:47] and who is a rock
[56:50] Save Our God
[56:52] is my strength and power
[56:56] and he maketh
[56:57] my way
[56:59] perfect
[57:01] somebody say perfect
[57:03] now say that's me
[57:05] amen believe it
[57:08] God bless you and be seated now in the
[57:10] presence of God
[57:19] is my strength and my power
[57:22] and he
[57:24] maketh my way
[57:27] perfect
[57:29] now I want you to understand God is not
[57:31] the author of confusion nor of
[57:34] frustration
[57:36] God will never ask of you to do
[57:39] something
[57:41] that you have no ability to be able to
[57:44] do it or even if you are unable he is
[57:49] able
[57:50] so God will never ask you to be perfect
[57:54] without making a way for that perfection
[57:58] so
[58:00] I thank the Lord in that because I tend
[58:03] to look at myself and I'm striving to be
[58:08] better I'm striving to be a better
[58:11] husband to be a better father to be a
[58:14] better Christian to be a better Pastor
[58:16] to just be better and there are times
[58:19] when I frustrate myself because I make
[58:23] mistakes
[58:25] I know all of you are sitting there and
[58:28] it probably popped your bubble
[58:30] and you thought that I am perfect
[58:33] but I'm here to tell you that I'm just
[58:36] like you and that's how it was even with
[58:39] the men of old the Bible says they were
[58:41] men of like passion
[58:44] they went through the same things you
[58:46] went through
[58:47] Paul said I was the chiefest of Sinners
[58:50] do you think he was lying
[58:52] he just didn't elaborate
[58:56] amen
[58:58] I thank God for his grace and his Mercy
[59:03] now when I think about this Perfection
[59:05] that God is requiring of us
[59:09] I then began to quandary in my mind to
[59:12] begin to question father you said be ye
[59:16] perfect
[59:18] as the Lord your father in Heaven is
[59:21] perfect
[59:23] and I thought wow if there's anybody
[59:25] that looks at himself and realizes I
[59:29] fall short of perfection it is myself
[59:34] and so I uh uh if I'm not careful
[59:39] what I do is I'm too hard on myself
[59:44] or any of you that way
[59:47] that you're kind of hard on yourself you
[59:49] make a mistake well if you know I talk
[59:52] to myself all the time
[59:54] if you son had any brains at all
[59:58] if
[59:59] I won't tell you the rest of this stuff
[1:00:01] I tell me because sometimes I think it's
[1:00:03] not edifying but I do get it myself and
[1:00:07] if if uh I saw a man had had he'd drawn
[1:00:11] a machine
[1:00:14] um how that you could
[1:00:16] um you could take care of some of your
[1:00:19] frustrations it was a kicking machine he
[1:00:21] had a rope out in front of him and you
[1:00:24] could do pull down on a rope when you
[1:00:26] did you had to boot behind you and it
[1:00:27] was kicking you
[1:00:29] sometimes I would like to have that
[1:00:30] thing hey come here Ronald
[1:00:33] you should know better
[1:00:38] but we have to understand something you
[1:00:40] do make mistakes and if there's anything
[1:00:44] that you can do to make it right then
[1:00:47] Jesus Christ died in vain
[1:00:50] Jesus Christ came to save The Sinner he
[1:00:53] came to set you free from yourself he
[1:00:57] came to set you free from the things
[1:01:00] that seem to to hold you back and God is
[1:01:04] expecting you to believe his word
[1:01:08] amen
[1:01:10] he is my strength and my power and he
[1:01:13] makes my way perfect Job chapter 11.
[1:01:18] and then I will go to Second Corinthians
[1:01:21] 13. job 11.
[1:01:26] verse 4.
[1:01:32] for thou Hast said my Doctrine is pure
[1:01:36] and I am clean in thine eyes
[1:01:39] but oh that God would speak and open his
[1:01:42] lips against thee
[1:01:44] that he would show Thee the secrets
[1:01:47] of wisdom
[1:01:49] that they are double to that which is
[1:01:54] know therefore that God exacteth Of Thee
[1:01:58] less
[1:01:59] then thine iniquity deserves
[1:02:03] somebody say praise God
[1:02:08] is going to exact from you less than
[1:02:11] what you deserve
[1:02:13] then why are you so hard on everybody
[1:02:15] else
[1:02:18] when you look down at others and say
[1:02:20] they made this mistake this and that you
[1:02:22] know what God I tell you what take him
[1:02:24] the task well I'll tell you what when it
[1:02:26] comes to you you're always asking for
[1:02:28] Mercy oh God give this self-righteous
[1:02:31] attitude out of our minds and out of our
[1:02:34] our thoughts that we would look at
[1:02:36] others like God wants to look at us
[1:02:39] through the blood
[1:02:44] Hallelujah
[1:02:49] verse 7 counts thou by searching find
[1:02:52] out God
[1:02:54] can still find out the Almighty
[1:02:58] unto perfection
[1:03:01] it is as high as heaven
[1:03:04] I love this you talk about this
[1:03:06] Perfection it's as high as heaven
[1:03:12] what can thou do deeper than hell
[1:03:17] what can't thou no
[1:03:20] the measure thereof is longer than the
[1:03:22] Earth
[1:03:24] and broader than the sea
[1:03:27] talk about
[1:03:29] God's perfection
[1:03:34] second Corinthians if you would turn
[1:03:36] with me and then we'll take our text and
[1:03:39] launch off into
[1:03:41] the service this morning
[1:03:46] second Corinthians chapter 13.
[1:03:50] verse 9 and 11.
[1:03:54] for we are glad when we are weak
[1:03:58] for ye are strong
[1:04:01] and this also we wish
[1:04:04] even
[1:04:05] your perfection
[1:04:08] therefore I write these things being
[1:04:10] absent
[1:04:12] lest being present
[1:04:14] I should use sharpness according to the
[1:04:16] power which the Lord hath given me to
[1:04:18] edification and not to destruction
[1:04:23] finally brethren
[1:04:25] farewell
[1:04:27] be perfect
[1:04:29] be of good comfort
[1:04:31] be of one mind live in peace
[1:04:35] and the god of love
[1:04:37] and peace
[1:04:40] shall be with you
[1:04:42] may God bless the reading of his word
[1:04:44] this morning
[1:04:45] I have an awful lot that is upon my
[1:04:48] heart
[1:04:52] and I need the Lord to give me words
[1:04:55] to be able to
[1:04:59] give them to you
[1:05:02] I'd like to title my sermon this morning
[1:05:05] God's
[1:05:06] provided way of perfection
[1:05:12] and I'd like to take a subject it's God
[1:05:14] perfecting the bride in the third pool
[1:05:25] he says you know you all know what that
[1:05:27] third pull is it's identified before you
[1:05:31] he said it's in me now
[1:05:35] he said watch when the time comes and
[1:05:38] the squeeze begins to come on
[1:05:41] he said what you've seen temporarily
[1:05:45] shall manifest in the fullness of its
[1:05:48] power
[1:05:49] he said therefore I must be quiet silent
[1:05:53] I must be backing off
[1:05:56] nothing sinful you know just waiting for
[1:05:59] that moment
[1:06:01] I feel we should all be having a
[1:06:04] reverent time before God
[1:06:06] I know you are calling me to something
[1:06:09] far greater than what I am
[1:06:18] the prophet speaks
[1:06:21] about the word perfection
[1:06:24] 248 times
[1:06:27] in his ministry
[1:06:31] he talks about having perfect faith
[1:06:36] he talks about a perfect Rapture he
[1:06:39] talks about a perfect God
[1:06:42] and he talks about having perfect love
[1:06:46] not uh
[1:06:49] filial love
[1:06:50] but an agapola he said because none of
[1:06:54] you will make it unless you have that
[1:06:56] Godly love
[1:06:59] amen I feel that many times we fall
[1:07:01] short
[1:07:03] of having that Godly love not just for
[1:07:07] God but for one another
[1:07:12] in one of the last sermons and I have it
[1:07:14] a lot this morning and I'm going to do
[1:07:16] some reading
[1:07:18] and in doing this what it does is I
[1:07:21] believe saints of God this way to
[1:07:24] perfection
[1:07:27] God gave us the remedy of this the
[1:07:31] formula to this through the prophet's
[1:07:34] message
[1:07:36] he's showing you he's telling you how
[1:07:40] you can come to Perfection are you
[1:07:43] interested in that amen
[1:07:46] so in one of the last sermons he
[1:07:48] preaches in 65 on the things that are to
[1:07:52] be
[1:07:53] I am only going to read the highlighted
[1:07:56] portion you read the rest of the quote
[1:07:58] when you get home
[1:08:00] it's a perfect place calling you to that
[1:08:03] perfection
[1:08:04] and you have to be perfect to get there
[1:08:08] the Bible said so
[1:08:11] Jesus said ye be therefore perfect even
[1:08:13] as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:08:16] it's a perfect Kingdom
[1:08:19] so it must be a perfect people come
[1:08:23] because you have to stand now and be
[1:08:25] married to a perfect Son of God and you
[1:08:28] must be a perfect bride
[1:08:30] so how can you do it through anything
[1:08:33] else but the perfect word of God
[1:08:36] which is the Waters of separation
[1:08:40] that washes us from our sins amen says
[1:08:45] that's right the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:47] think of it the dripping bloody word
[1:08:50] amen
[1:08:51] the blood and the word of God bleeding
[1:08:54] word to wash the bride in amen yes sir
[1:08:57] she stands perfect
[1:09:00] virgin
[1:09:02] unadulterated listen to me she's not a
[1:09:05] forgiven woman
[1:09:09] she is fully justified in the eyes of
[1:09:13] God as though she never did it in the
[1:09:16] beginning not forgiven
[1:09:19] fully Justified
[1:09:23] she never sinned
[1:09:25] in the first place
[1:09:29] now this wording here that brother Brown
[1:09:31] says
[1:09:33] it is called the Waters of separation
[1:09:36] I want you to understand that this
[1:09:38] message
[1:09:39] let me paraphrase it and say is the
[1:09:43] Waters of Separation in this hour
[1:09:46] God is using this prophet's message to
[1:09:51] wash the bride
[1:09:53] he said if I can get her to stand still
[1:09:56] long enough
[1:09:58] and if I he says and get her to pay
[1:10:01] attention I will dress her with the word
[1:10:04] hallelujah are you ready this morning
[1:10:07] bride to be stand and dressed Hallelujah
[1:10:11] that's Esther
[1:10:15] how do I know how to dress the king's
[1:10:19] servant will tell you yes sir if you're
[1:10:22] listening I'll tell you it's not with
[1:10:25] the world it's not with the fashion it's
[1:10:28] not with all those things he will tell
[1:10:30] you it will be a modest apparel it will
[1:10:34] be something that will please the king
[1:10:36] not a flash
[1:10:43] amen
[1:10:45] now during our last service I as I told
[1:10:48] you and just to reiterate just for a
[1:10:50] moment
[1:10:51] the Bible
[1:10:52] says that there are four men in the
[1:10:55] Bible that were perfect before God
[1:10:58] Noah Abraham and job
[1:11:02] but there was another one a fourth one
[1:11:04] that we've never really looked at that I
[1:11:06] told you his name was the king of Tyrus
[1:11:11] he says thouest in the garden of God
[1:11:14] that was perfect in all thy Beauty all
[1:11:17] thy ways when when thou was created was
[1:11:20] perfect
[1:11:21] and King Tyrus was just a man he was
[1:11:26] just an image of something far greater
[1:11:29] he said when that Prophet began to speak
[1:11:32] there to the king of Tyrus what he was
[1:11:36] doing he was speaking to Satan in that
[1:11:40] man
[1:11:41] and he said Satan dwells in a perfect
[1:11:46] Beauty
[1:11:49] he said now watch God is Not
[1:11:53] dwelling in Beauty
[1:11:55] he dwells in character
[1:11:58] take not your beauty from the world
[1:12:02] that's why all of the women in the world
[1:12:05] they have to try to stay up with beauty
[1:12:10] from the time of 18 the prophet of God
[1:12:13] says 18 to 20 years of age whether it be
[1:12:16] the men or the women guess what you
[1:12:19] start to die
[1:12:21] your body no matter how much you you you
[1:12:23] lift the weights no matter how much you
[1:12:26] run no matter how much you try to eat or
[1:12:28] or put it moisturizer on your face and
[1:12:32] try to take care of the wrinkles let me
[1:12:34] tell you age is coming
[1:12:41] and those
[1:12:42] movie stars and actresses and the
[1:12:45] different ones how vain it is for beauty
[1:12:50] is vain
[1:12:51] and how if it weren't for the doctors
[1:12:54] and the and the makeup artists and and
[1:12:58] all of the uh those guys that do the
[1:13:01] skin graft whatever they call
[1:13:03] plastic surgeons yeah they feel those
[1:13:06] guys as pockets
[1:13:08] with the desire to want to stay and look
[1:13:12] perfect
[1:13:15] let me tell you the only thing
[1:13:18] that God is requiring out of you is not
[1:13:22] being perfect
[1:13:24] in looks
[1:13:27] but in character
[1:13:29] God expects your character to ex far
[1:13:32] exceed that of your physical appearance
[1:13:36] because if God only
[1:13:39] accepts those who are of good found
[1:13:42] countenance than some of us
[1:13:46] ain't gonna make it
[1:13:49] huh let's face it
[1:13:52] but thank God he's not looking at the
[1:13:55] outward God is looking at the n-word let
[1:13:57] me tell you some of you have uh don't
[1:14:01] have that outward
[1:14:03] Beauty as the world would say it but
[1:14:06] I'll tell you your character far exceeds
[1:14:10] anything that is with that our beauty
[1:14:13] that will fade it will go away but your
[1:14:18] beauty that you have is an Inward and
[1:14:21] it's going to get more charactered and
[1:14:24] more christ-like and and better and More
[1:14:26] Beautiful every day that you grow in
[1:14:30] Christ
[1:14:31] somebody say Amen to that
[1:14:37] now this term perfection in the Old
[1:14:40] Testament
[1:14:44] the Hebrew word means without blemish it
[1:14:47] means to be complete to be full perfect
[1:14:51] undefiled upright
[1:14:53] morally undefiled
[1:14:58] in the New Testament
[1:15:01] the word perfect
[1:15:03] comes from the root word teleos
[1:15:07] meanings having reached an end a
[1:15:09] destination a goal
[1:15:13] so when God says they want you to come
[1:15:15] to Perfection it's actually a
[1:15:18] destination
[1:15:24] are we together on that now
[1:15:26] and so if it's a an and a goal a
[1:15:32] destination then God's got to make a way
[1:15:35] for you to get there
[1:15:39] because he would make you totally
[1:15:41] frustrated
[1:15:43] and feel so unfulfilled within yourself
[1:15:46] if you try and cannot Attain
[1:15:50] so what God does is he's making an
[1:15:53] unconditional Covenant with the Seed of
[1:15:56] Abraham
[1:15:57] amen with the Seed of Abraham the
[1:16:01] faithful seed that comes by faith in
[1:16:04] Jesus Christ
[1:16:06] amen he makes a way for them
[1:16:09] he is a Waymaker
[1:16:13] so understand God has called all of his
[1:16:16] seed
[1:16:17] for a purpose to open your eyes of
[1:16:20] understanding that's why you're here
[1:16:22] this morning
[1:16:24] the little thread that kind of sows all
[1:16:28] of us together is the fact that God has
[1:16:30] sent a message
[1:16:32] and we've been enlightened
[1:16:36] we've been quickened
[1:16:39] to our understanding of what God has
[1:16:42] done in this hour
[1:16:44] so all of you have been called for a
[1:16:46] purpose
[1:16:48] God allows you to have a career
[1:16:51] God allows you to have a business or
[1:16:55] something in order for you to provide
[1:16:57] for your family but that's not your
[1:17:00] purpose
[1:17:02] what good is it if a man gains the whole
[1:17:05] world and loses his soul
[1:17:08] Jesus said therefore bringing him back
[1:17:11] to the the the thing that's most
[1:17:14] preeminent
[1:17:16] seek first the kingdom of God and his
[1:17:20] righteousness and all these things
[1:17:22] houses lands what you going to eat what
[1:17:24] you going to wear
[1:17:26] huh will be added to you so the very
[1:17:30] first thing you need to seek
[1:17:32] is his kingdom
[1:17:37] the ministry of Christ listen to me not
[1:17:42] the ministry of Jesus
[1:17:44] the ministry of Christ
[1:17:47] now Christ means the anointing
[1:17:54] the ministry of the word
[1:17:57] the logos thought of God any beginning
[1:18:00] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:18:03] and the Word was God
[1:18:05] and the word became flesh
[1:18:08] so we understand but he said that logos
[1:18:11] had a concept
[1:18:12] and that concept was the mystery
[1:18:18] of God
[1:18:20] to be revealed
[1:18:22] he said now God could not do it as great
[1:18:25] Jehovah God he's too mysterious
[1:18:30] these two all-powerful
[1:18:33] you could not grasp it
[1:18:36] so God condensed it down
[1:18:40] God came down and he
[1:18:43] became a form
[1:18:45] that we could look we could see
[1:18:48] we could understand
[1:18:50] Jesus did not come to reveal himself
[1:18:55] the sole purpose for Jesus Christ was to
[1:18:59] reveal the father
[1:19:01] I can do nothing except the father
[1:19:05] reveal it
[1:19:08] the disciples asked him one time show us
[1:19:10] the father
[1:19:12] he said how many sermons do I have to
[1:19:14] preach how many tapes you have to listen
[1:19:16] to How many times you have to read your
[1:19:18] Bible how many times you have to get on
[1:19:21] your knees and ask God if you've seen me
[1:19:24] you've seen the father because I and my
[1:19:28] father are one it's not three gods in
[1:19:31] heaven it's not father Son and Holy
[1:19:33] Ghost
[1:19:34] there's one
[1:19:37] God spoke to Moses tell my people hear o
[1:19:41] Israel
[1:19:42] the Lord your God is one
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:51] every sea Gene
[1:19:54] will come to an understanding
[1:19:57] in your life you personally
[1:20:01] God revealing himself to you
[1:20:05] every one of you have got to come to
[1:20:07] that place you do not get to that place
[1:20:10] because you were born in a message
[1:20:12] family or into a Christian home or into
[1:20:15] a Christian Church you must have your
[1:20:19] experience with God yourself
[1:20:22] Jacob is a perfect example of a man who
[1:20:25] is born in a Godly message family
[1:20:28] Abraham is his grandfather Isaac is his
[1:20:31] father he has heard all of the stories
[1:20:34] he sat on Grandpa's knee
[1:20:37] he heard about when he met Melchizedek
[1:20:39] he heard all the stories no doubt
[1:20:43] Abraham was overcome and tears had come
[1:20:47] down his eyes about how that God had met
[1:20:50] him oh you should have been there when
[1:20:53] God told me stay the hand to Abraham for
[1:20:56] and now I know you love me
[1:21:00] but it never changed Jacob's life
[1:21:03] Jacob had had many Bethel experiences
[1:21:06] and I'm afraid there's so many within
[1:21:09] the message today that they only have
[1:21:12] Bethel experiences that's okay you can
[1:21:16] see Angels ascending and descending you
[1:21:20] can see appearances you can feel
[1:21:22] anointings
[1:21:24] but it must come to a time of a personal
[1:21:27] wrestling with God Amen where Jacob
[1:21:31] grabbed a hold of that angel
[1:21:33] and said tell me your name and give me a
[1:21:36] blessing
[1:21:37] and the angel said let me go
[1:21:42] why do you want my name
[1:21:45] what is your name and the angel tries to
[1:21:48] get away from him let me tell you there
[1:21:51] are times in your life you're going to
[1:21:53] have to wrestle for the blessing you
[1:21:55] want
[1:21:56] and if you're not willing to wrestle for
[1:21:58] it you ain't getting it amen that God
[1:22:01] don't just play
[1:22:03] this is not playing church sometimes you
[1:22:06] have to say God you have to get into
[1:22:08] that desperation you have to say oh God
[1:22:11] I need you now more than ever stay with
[1:22:14] me
[1:22:18] and there he wrestled with God face to
[1:22:21] face
[1:22:24] the Bible says and he called the name of
[1:22:26] this place
[1:22:27] peniel
[1:22:30] I have met God face to face
[1:22:33] every one of you and the reason that
[1:22:35] Jacob
[1:22:37] two things that happened to him changed
[1:22:40] his name
[1:22:41] what is your name my name is Jacob no
[1:22:45] he said that's your birth name
[1:22:49] that's your birth name Jacob means
[1:22:51] shyster supplanter that's not who you
[1:22:55] are
[1:22:56] I got another name a name that was given
[1:22:59] to you before the foundation of the
[1:23:00] world your name Shall be Called Israel
[1:23:03] because thou art a prince with God
[1:23:08] and he touched him on the Hall of his
[1:23:11] thigh
[1:23:12] and Jacob
[1:23:15] the rest of his life
[1:23:17] for Witness
[1:23:19] every day
[1:23:22] his walk
[1:23:27] you'll know
[1:23:29] about your walk
[1:23:32] when you've wrestled with God
[1:23:40] this is for somebody this morning
[1:23:46] it is the ministry of Christ
[1:23:50] that perfects the bride
[1:23:53] it is not the prophet
[1:23:56] it is not the tapes it is not the
[1:23:59] ministry it is your relationship between
[1:24:02] you and Jesus Christ personally can we
[1:24:06] say Amen to that
[1:24:08] and so even the new birth is Christ
[1:24:10] making himself known to you personally
[1:24:15] when you read your Bible you have to put
[1:24:18] yourself in those scriptures
[1:24:22] and brother Billy when you were in in
[1:24:24] prison there in Mexico you read a
[1:24:27] scripture and I think you were referring
[1:24:30] to Isaiah and the man the prisoner next
[1:24:32] to you you put his name and you read his
[1:24:35] name and he said really is my name there
[1:24:39] because what happened all of a sudden
[1:24:41] the man well you mean to tell me I'm a
[1:24:44] part of that
[1:24:46] oh Hallelujah if by revelation of the
[1:24:50] Holy Spirit behold I send unto you
[1:24:53] Elijah be all I send unto you John
[1:24:57] behold Sarah behold Judy behold all of
[1:25:02] the different ones behold I send unto
[1:25:04] you can you put your name there
[1:25:10] I make it personal
[1:25:14] listen the ministry of Christ
[1:25:20] is a quickening Ministry
[1:25:23] not the ministry of Jesus that's the man
[1:25:27] but I want to take you all the way back
[1:25:30] because the ministry of Christ the
[1:25:34] anointing the logos thought
[1:25:37] is what quickens every seed
[1:25:40] from Genesis to revelation
[1:25:43] when Abel needed
[1:25:46] a sacrifice
[1:25:50] he was quick
[1:25:53] what was it that quickened
[1:25:56] the anointing
[1:25:58] there was an anointing that came over
[1:26:00] him wow B
[1:26:03] a lamb an altar
[1:26:06] a vision I saw it God you see when God
[1:26:10] reveals himself to you it's as a vision
[1:26:14] why because your mind's eye of
[1:26:17] understanding is illuminated wow now I
[1:26:21] know and so he he he he he he does
[1:26:24] according to the vision what is it it's
[1:26:27] the anointing of Christ brother Randolph
[1:26:30] said it is the identified Christ of all
[1:26:33] ages there was Christ and David who
[1:26:37] cried my bones they stare at me it was
[1:26:39] Christ and Jeremiah it was Christ in
[1:26:42] Ezekiel it was Christ and job it was
[1:26:46] Christ in every character and if it was
[1:26:49] Christ in all of them it's got to be
[1:26:51] Christ in you
[1:26:53] okay
[1:27:00] the Apostle Paul said it's no longer I
[1:27:02] that live
[1:27:04] but Christ that liveth in me and the
[1:27:06] life that I now live I live by the faith
[1:27:09] of the son of God
[1:27:13] and then he confesses
[1:27:15] oh when I try to do good
[1:27:18] evil is present with me and that which I
[1:27:21] don't want to do that I do
[1:27:23] any of you ever been there
[1:27:26] when you try to do good Evil's present
[1:27:28] with you and you wind up doing the thing
[1:27:29] you didn't want to do and that I need to
[1:27:31] say oh God forgive me
[1:27:34] then you wish you had that little
[1:27:35] kicking machine
[1:27:41] you want a bulldozer
[1:27:43] well
[1:27:45] you may get one
[1:27:47] be careful with you
[1:28:05] when you make a mistake
[1:28:09] and you do wrong
[1:28:13] isn't it hard to forgive yourself
[1:28:17] I'm speaking to somebody here this
[1:28:18] morning
[1:28:22] isn't it hard for you to say
[1:28:25] you know because really
[1:28:30] it's hard to even ask for forgiveness
[1:28:32] because I did it and I knew better and I
[1:28:35] shouldn't have done it but I did it
[1:28:46] so now in this
[1:28:49] anointing
[1:28:51] in this quickening power
[1:28:58] it is going to reveal to you Christ The
[1:29:01] Mystery of God
[1:29:04] that's why he comes
[1:29:06] this Christ anointing on you
[1:29:09] brother Brown said in the questions and
[1:29:11] answers on Genesis
[1:29:13] that was called by Bible readers logos
[1:29:17] or the anointed or the anointing
[1:29:22] that part of God began to develop into
[1:29:24] something so human beings could have
[1:29:27] some some type of an idea what it was it
[1:29:31] was a little low little light movie that
[1:29:35] was the word of God
[1:29:37] in the sermon why brother rev said we
[1:29:40] realize that God that logos or the
[1:29:42] pillar of fire that followed the
[1:29:44] children of Israel through the
[1:29:46] Wilderness that was Christ
[1:29:49] that was the anointing
[1:29:52] I want to ask you that same Pillar of
[1:29:55] Fire has shown itself once again in this
[1:29:59] our day and we are not following a man
[1:30:02] we are not following a prophet We are
[1:30:05] following the pillar of Fire
[1:30:08] because when the fire moved Moses moved
[1:30:11] with it when the fire stopped when it
[1:30:14] became a cloud they they made up camp Oh
[1:30:17] my brother my sister realized we are not
[1:30:20] following a man God does not have you
[1:30:23] follow a man he has you follow himself
[1:30:34] you have been predestinated
[1:30:37] before the foundation of the world to
[1:30:38] hear the word of God for this hour
[1:30:41] that's right God came looking for you
[1:30:44] you weren't looking for God I can't God
[1:30:47] came looking for you
[1:30:52] acts 13 verse 48 when the Gentiles heard
[1:30:56] this
[1:30:57] they were glad and glorified the word of
[1:31:00] the Lord and as many as were ordained to
[1:31:04] eternal life believed
[1:31:08] they weren't tucked into it
[1:31:10] as many as were ordained
[1:31:13] believe you don't talk anybody into
[1:31:17] believing they believe or they don't
[1:31:19] believe why because the ordination of
[1:31:23] God this predestination listen my
[1:31:27] brother my sister you can be covered
[1:31:29] with all kinds of clouds of Darkness you
[1:31:32] could have everything to try to hinder
[1:31:35] you from getting to see what you're
[1:31:39] supposed to see
[1:31:40] but with the light penetrates that
[1:31:43] Darkness
[1:31:44] Hallelujah when the light penetrates
[1:31:46] that Darkness it quickens that seed to
[1:31:49] life
[1:31:50] can you say Amen to that it's not you
[1:31:53] doing it
[1:31:54] you were ordained to life and as many as
[1:31:58] were ordained to eternal life
[1:32:01] believed
[1:32:04] it's what believers do
[1:32:06] we believe it's just too simple oh tell
[1:32:09] me something I need to do yeah oh give
[1:32:12] me something I there's something I've
[1:32:14] got to achieve
[1:32:16] tell me what to do to inherit
[1:32:19] eternal life
[1:32:21] just believe no no no no no you didn't
[1:32:23] hear me give me something
[1:32:26] just believe
[1:32:27] I believe already just give me something
[1:32:32] oh maybe Lee
[1:32:36] wait wait wait
[1:32:39] you mean I've got something
[1:32:41] inside of me already that's answering
[1:32:44] back
[1:32:46] that says I believe
[1:32:51] I want to ask you what is that
[1:32:55] what is that you
[1:32:57] you don't understand it
[1:32:59] you didn't know who you were
[1:33:02] you didn't know if he's one God or three
[1:33:04] gods
[1:33:06] you didn't know anything
[1:33:08] but God rich and mercy ordained
[1:33:11] predestinated you so that when the light
[1:33:14] Shone across your path guess what it
[1:33:16] does it causes you
[1:33:18] huh
[1:33:20] that's me mama
[1:33:25] I love that song
[1:33:29] the sermon perfection
[1:33:31] oh God requires
[1:33:35] perfection
[1:33:37] he requires your repentance he requires
[1:33:39] your loyalty him he's looking tonight no
[1:33:41] matter how much you've sinned how much
[1:33:43] or how how little or how much you're
[1:33:45] still a sinner you cannot get in no
[1:33:47] other way but by Jesus Christ God's all
[1:33:51] sufficient sacrifice and in him you are
[1:33:54] perfected forever
[1:33:56] why
[1:33:57] in him
[1:33:59] you're perfected forever think of it
[1:34:01] that's nothing you do
[1:34:04] it's not new pages you turn
[1:34:07] it's not a new life you start it's
[1:34:09] confession of your wrong
[1:34:11] and God's grace to you
[1:34:14] that brings you to perfection
[1:34:17] then you are perfected in Jesus Christ
[1:34:25] wait a second
[1:34:26] what part
[1:34:29] do I have to play in this
[1:34:34] you don't have a part
[1:34:39] it's him
[1:34:42] it's him doing it it's his calling
[1:34:45] it's his providing the way
[1:34:47] it's all about the seed
[1:34:51] listen this outer shell that we call you
[1:34:54] is not really you
[1:34:57] it's only what we see this it's the
[1:35:00] Earthly it's the Jacob you it's the
[1:35:02] little shyster the liar the guy that
[1:35:04] does brother deals to everybody else
[1:35:07] right that wasn't really him but God was
[1:35:10] looking Beyond
[1:35:12] and he saw the Israel he saw a prince
[1:35:15] with God do you understand God's not
[1:35:17] looking at you you
[1:35:20] he's looking at the god you

[1:35:50] and you wave back
[1:35:52] and they keep waving and then you
[1:35:54] realize they're waving to somebody
[1:35:55] behind you
[1:35:59] yeah hey yeah yeah
[1:36:05] act like you know him
[1:36:07] hey yeah
[1:36:09] how you doing brother
[1:36:12] you see what God is doing is he's trying
[1:36:15] to get your attention
[1:36:17] and he does it through the word that's
[1:36:18] the Christ anointing it is the third
[1:36:20] poll now watch this because there's got
[1:36:22] to be a way for God to bring you into a
[1:36:26] place of perfection
[1:36:28] now that third pull you all know brother
[1:36:30] Ram said it all has to do with the word
[1:36:32] being spoken it's a spoken shh be real
[1:36:36] reverent this is what I've told you we
[1:36:39] have long deceived for all these years
[1:36:41] it hasn't wasn't in the first and second
[1:36:43] poll it wasn't in all the healings and
[1:36:46] the discernments those those are good
[1:36:48] but he says let me tell you there's
[1:36:50] something far greater that's going on
[1:36:52] right now and this is what I've got to
[1:36:54] be reverent to it means a lot of
[1:36:56] breaking down a lot of becoming more
[1:36:58] sincere than what I've ever become amen
[1:37:01] what about you and I it takes a greater
[1:37:04] sincerity than what we've had oh God if
[1:37:07] there's anything we need it's a double
[1:37:10] dose of sincerity right now
[1:37:17] your perfection's coming in Christ
[1:37:22] that's why God has given this ministry
[1:37:25] of perfection to the church now
[1:37:27] understand it's not a man
[1:37:31] it's not the fivefold ministry
[1:37:34] it is the ministry of Christ
[1:37:38] that is the anointing
[1:37:41] because without the anointing you can
[1:37:44] have the message and never understand it
[1:37:48] you can have the Bible and never
[1:37:51] understand the god of the Bible
[1:37:54] but when God opens up the eyes of your
[1:37:58] understanding and then you see it your
[1:38:02] Bible becomes a new Bible the message
[1:38:05] becomes a whole new message it's not
[1:38:07] Creeds and dogmas it's not a long skirt
[1:38:09] in long hair those are traditions
[1:38:13] we do that because God is revealed to us
[1:38:16] what his will is and so therefore we
[1:38:20] give it back to him and then God says
[1:38:22] that's righteousness
[1:38:33] Luke 13 verse 31 and 32
[1:38:38] same day there came a certain of the
[1:38:40] Pharisees saying unto him get thee out
[1:38:42] and the depart thanks for Herod will
[1:38:44] kill thee
[1:38:46] and he said to them go and tell that fox
[1:38:49] behold I cast out devils and I do cures
[1:38:52] today and tomorrow
[1:38:53] and the third day I shall be perfected
[1:38:58] you see brother Brown said watch your
[1:39:00] numbers
[1:39:02] three's perfection
[1:39:05] the first and second pull was only an
[1:39:07] attraction that never perfected nobody
[1:39:10] tell them who they are where they come
[1:39:12] from
[1:39:14] have all kinds of Visions yes yes
[1:39:18] yes that's me
[1:39:23] that only was an attraction
[1:39:26] we know that thou art a man come from
[1:39:28] God because no man could do these things
[1:39:31] except that God be with him but he said
[1:39:33] now listen very carefully he said there
[1:39:36] it is not the sign that is the
[1:39:38] attraction
[1:39:39] it's the voice behind
[1:39:42] the sign
[1:39:44] the voice of the sign
[1:39:46] you understand
[1:39:48] because saints of God if we're on our
[1:39:51] way to a destination
[1:39:54] and there is a sign Phoenix
[1:39:56] 35 miles
[1:40:00] as much as we enjoy the sign and the
[1:40:03] sign says Phoenix is 35 miles look Sandy
[1:40:08] wow we're almost there 35 miles and get
[1:40:13] out and run around the sign oh great
[1:40:15] sign we love you
[1:40:20] hey as much as I'm thankful for the sign
[1:40:23] somebody say let's keep going because
[1:40:27] the sign is not the destination the sign
[1:40:30] only tells me where I'm going
[1:40:35] I
[1:40:37] now
[1:40:40] understand this now I'm going to go into
[1:40:42] some deeper water here right now
[1:40:44] so I trust you
[1:40:46] can swim if you can't put on a little
[1:40:49] light vest and just tread water
[1:40:52] and try to keep up
[1:40:54] the change of ministry was a Perfection
[1:40:57] of ministry
[1:41:00] the change of ministry
[1:41:04] was a Perfection Ministry
[1:41:07] he is now cutting off those that don't
[1:41:10] have a part of a Perfection Ministry
[1:41:13] why the Shucks not air with the wheat
[1:41:16] the third poll is a separating pull the
[1:41:19] first two poles attracted everyone
[1:41:21] third pull is a separating pull except
[1:41:24] you eat of My Flesh and drink of my
[1:41:26] blood you have no part with me what is
[1:41:29] he doing he's separating
[1:41:31] so what God is doing in a third pole
[1:41:33] Ministry is he is separating that's why
[1:41:36] my brother my sister God is now
[1:41:39] separating those that are not going to
[1:41:42] have a portion of the quickening
[1:41:45] ministry under the third pull
[1:41:52] so I want to explore this thought
[1:41:56] for a short time this morning of
[1:41:58] perfection
[1:42:00] pertaining to the third pool
[1:42:03] now watch this here in the sermon
[1:42:05] perfect faith
[1:42:06] see the sermon title perfect faith
[1:42:11] 1963
[1:42:14] this is coming into that third pull
[1:42:17] I'm believing it
[1:42:20] then he talks about a sincere
[1:42:23] questionnaire thing this is just
[1:42:25] starting to bloom now
[1:42:28] see just started with I I did this for a
[1:42:32] purpose
[1:42:33] I did this for a purpose I'm working out
[1:42:36] something see it's taking this charge of
[1:42:40] faith and going right back to begin and
[1:42:42] come in see
[1:42:43] so kind of raise faith faith into a
[1:42:46] bracket where you've never noticed it in
[1:42:49] that way before
[1:42:51] not a faith
[1:42:53] but a perfect faith
[1:42:56] build it up here
[1:42:58] and watch a perfect god with a perfect
[1:43:00] heart keep a perfect promise
[1:43:04] by his perfect word
[1:43:06] which is sharper than any two-edged
[1:43:08] sword and a discerner of the thoughts of
[1:43:11] the heart what we're coming now to
[1:43:14] perfection
[1:43:16] because the people has got to come
[1:43:19] to this in order for rapture
[1:43:23] it's a prerequisite
[1:43:27] are you are you with me now
[1:43:30] you either go to school
[1:43:32] you have prerequisites
[1:43:36] you want to get a
[1:43:38] a degree
[1:43:40] you have prerequisites
[1:43:43] you have certain classes you've got to
[1:43:45] take in order to go to the next class
[1:43:47] and to the next class
[1:43:52] so we have something that we've got to
[1:43:54] attain to before we go to Rapture what
[1:43:56] is it Perfection it's a Ministry watch
[1:43:59] this that's what's holding it away right
[1:44:02] now it's waiting for that church to come
[1:44:04] into perfect raptured faith
[1:44:09] looking for it means a lot of Shaving
[1:44:12] down for me it means a lot for you but
[1:44:14] together we'll make it by the grace of
[1:44:17] God
[1:44:21] Touch Somebody next to you and say
[1:44:23] you'll make it
[1:44:24] yeah yeah that's it yeah you'll make it
[1:44:28] Why by the grace of God
[1:44:35] it's not by works of righteousness but
[1:44:39] by his grace I'm saying it's not by
[1:44:43] works of righteousness but by his grace
[1:44:46] I'm saved you see it's not us
[1:44:50] it's him
[1:44:53] it's all him
[1:44:56] start to finish
[1:44:58] before the beginning
[1:45:01] after the end
[1:45:05] it's all him
[1:45:10] you're just along for the right
[1:45:16] like your kids in a car
[1:45:18] Are We There Yet dead
[1:45:24] you'll know when I stop
[1:45:27] Are We There Yet dead
[1:45:33] you'll know
[1:45:37] you'll know
[1:45:40] amen
[1:45:42] third poll is the revealing of the word
[1:45:47] so brother Ram said the spirit of the
[1:45:50] Lord is now moving upon the bride now
[1:45:52] watch this moving upon the bride
[1:45:55] by divine inspiration
[1:45:58] she's being moved into position by
[1:46:01] revelation
[1:46:03] Now understand you couldn't do that with
[1:46:05] the prophet still here
[1:46:10] because as long as he's here we use him
[1:46:13] as our spiritual sounding board he'll
[1:46:16] get it for me he'll tell me
[1:46:17] I'll just go to church and hey guess
[1:46:19] what Pastor go ahead and tell me and I
[1:46:22] don't have to do anything and so he
[1:46:23] sweats and labors and everything so now
[1:46:25] God takes him off of the scene and we go
[1:46:32] well
[1:46:34] what do we do now
[1:46:39] God changing the ministry understand
[1:46:42] this now when you see a change of
[1:46:44] ministry understand there's a change of
[1:46:47] administration
[1:46:49] and when you see Jesus change his
[1:46:51] ministry
[1:46:53] there's coming an Administration
[1:46:55] underneath him but the ministry
[1:46:58] continues but just in another form
[1:47:02] it's God in morpha
[1:47:04] he went from a one-membered body
[1:47:08] to a many membered body
[1:47:11] and brother Ram said that is called the
[1:47:13] mystical body of Jesus Christ of which
[1:47:16] all of you are a part of
[1:47:20] if you're in Christ
[1:47:23] now
[1:47:25] the bride is being moved into position
[1:47:29] and placing by the holy spirit because
[1:47:31] the holy spirit is the divine revealer
[1:47:35] of God's word
[1:47:38] you're being moved into position
[1:47:40] every woman in the scripture that God
[1:47:44] took notice of
[1:47:46] was moved into position by revelation
[1:47:50] Ruth moved into position
[1:47:53] to lay at boaz's feet at the threshing
[1:47:57] floor
[1:47:58] it was revealed to her
[1:48:00] Esther moved into position to go before
[1:48:03] the king and if I perish
[1:48:07] I perish
[1:48:09] but I must see the king
[1:48:11] Rahab placed the token out her window
[1:48:18] after hiding The Messengers
[1:48:21] do you see
[1:48:23] Mary
[1:48:26] said how can these things be
[1:48:30] seeing that I know not a man
[1:48:33] said not many days hence and what the
[1:48:35] holy spirit will overshadow you
[1:48:38] I want you to understand that the
[1:48:39] overshadowing that God has used from
[1:48:42] Genesis to Revelation is the Christ of
[1:48:44] God
[1:48:49] Peter
[1:48:51] who do they say that I the son of man am
[1:48:55] some say thou art Jeremiah one of the
[1:48:57] prophets raised up
[1:48:59] return Ministry
[1:49:03] but Peter
[1:49:05] who do you say that I am
[1:49:08] now in a couple of the
[1:49:11] Scriptures it says the Christ the son of
[1:49:14] the Living God
[1:49:15] but in one particular scripture he says
[1:49:18] Thou Art the Christ of God
[1:49:21] because this same Jesus whom you have
[1:49:24] crucified God hath made him both Lord
[1:49:27] and
[1:49:28] Christ
[1:49:31] he is the anointed that's why they
[1:49:33] called him Jesus the Christ
[1:49:38] he is the Christ of God I want all of
[1:49:41] you to understand
[1:49:42] the Christ of God
[1:49:44] is the anointed word
[1:49:47] made revealed to you personally that's
[1:49:51] why this message
[1:49:54] is not Church order
[1:49:57] that's a part of it
[1:49:58] it's not how to dress
[1:50:01] it's not how to pay your tithes it's not
[1:50:05] how to go to church
[1:50:07] the message is Christ brother random
[1:50:10] said he is those seals he is this
[1:50:14] message you think I got anything to do
[1:50:16] with it I have nothing to do with it I'm
[1:50:19] just a voice
[1:50:22] he's using
[1:50:24] and you remember that one quote this is
[1:50:27] no longer the voice of William Brown
[1:50:36] when the bride begins to catch the true
[1:50:39] revelation
[1:50:40] of who she is
[1:50:43] and by God's spirit
[1:50:45] discern and withstand the two spirits
[1:50:50] working within the framework of the
[1:50:52] church
[1:50:53] it's not going to be a Catholic Spirit a
[1:50:56] Lutheran Spirit a presbyterian Spirit a
[1:50:59] denominational spirit
[1:51:02] no it's going to be a spirit so close
[1:51:06] that if it were possible it would
[1:51:09] deceive the very elect
[1:51:12] brother Ram said I'm going to give a
[1:51:13] word to the church any of you ever read
[1:51:15] that
[1:51:16] he said now do you think that God's
[1:51:18] going to let you stay as one big happy
[1:51:20] family
[1:51:22] he said no you know what he's going to
[1:51:23] do he's going to wreak all kinds of
[1:51:25] Havoc he if he can't get among you he
[1:51:29] will anoint someone
[1:51:32] and place them there among you to shoot
[1:51:34] all kinds of poison and Discord that's
[1:51:37] why listen be careful who and what you
[1:51:40] say about anybody
[1:51:45] do you like to be somebody's trash can
[1:51:48] oh hey let me tell you don't tell
[1:51:51] anybody this but you know that uh you
[1:51:54] know uh look don't don't don't don't
[1:51:56] share this with nobody else I'm just
[1:51:58] telling you it's between you and I you
[1:52:01] know what that really means Go Tell It
[1:52:03] on the Mountain
[1:52:09] there's one person that I have told
[1:52:11] everything and he knows the very
[1:52:13] darkest deepest secrets of my life and
[1:52:16] he has never told
[1:52:18] nobody
[1:52:20] that's Jesus himself
[1:52:23] he's the only one I can confide in
[1:52:26] oh yeah you can confide in certain ones
[1:52:28] the next thing you know well I'll tell
[1:52:30] you what he told me this he told me that
[1:52:33] God help us
[1:52:36] amen
[1:52:38] now
[1:52:42] each one of them
[1:52:44] from Jeremiah to King David
[1:52:49] from all of the players within the Bible
[1:52:52] that we could take and we could go and
[1:52:54] we could go through every chapter in the
[1:52:57] Bible and we could see the ones that
[1:52:59] Christ follow me now that Christ was
[1:53:02] anointing them to play their part
[1:53:06] we could go through numbers we could go
[1:53:08] into Deuteronomy we could go into the
[1:53:10] book of First Samuel go to First Kings
[1:53:13] we could go into and go on Chronicles on
[1:53:16] on on Psalms Proverbs Isaiah Jeremiah
[1:53:19] Daniel Amos
[1:53:22] Zachariah Zephaniah it doesn't matter
[1:53:24] every one of them were playing a part
[1:53:27] that the anointing of God was causing
[1:53:31] them to know their position and pleasing
[1:53:34] that's why the prophet of God said it is
[1:53:37] so very important to know who you are
[1:53:39] and what part you play
[1:53:48] that's why that day
[1:53:52] when Christ entered his ministry
[1:53:55] I want to ask you
[1:53:57] he was a young boy that he confounded
[1:54:00] the Pharisees in the time of the temple
[1:54:02] is that right
[1:54:03] he'd been lost for three days parents
[1:54:05] can't find him
[1:54:09] when they do find him he's in the temple
[1:54:11] disputing
[1:54:12] they said don't you know your father and
[1:54:14] I have been looking for you for three
[1:54:15] days
[1:54:18] now the word corrects them and says I'm
[1:54:21] about my father's business
[1:54:24] Joseph's not my mama about my father's
[1:54:27] business are you listening to me
[1:54:29] Now understand this
[1:54:32] when did the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:54:34] start
[1:54:41] when he enters into the synagogue as it
[1:54:44] was his custom
[1:54:47] and he asked for the scroll of Isaiah
[1:54:50] and he took the scroll and he opened it
[1:54:52] up
[1:54:53] and he found where it was written
[1:54:57] you haven't anointed me
[1:55:01] to preach Glad Tidings to the poor you
[1:55:04] have caused me and it goes on and he
[1:55:07] writes he reads the place now the
[1:55:10] prophet of God said he knew exactly what
[1:55:14] Ministry he was to be under because God
[1:55:17] was revealing it to him but he had to
[1:55:19] find it in the Bible
[1:55:22] so therefore he found where it was
[1:55:24] written and let me paraphrase it he
[1:55:27] found where it was written of him
[1:55:31] this day
[1:55:33] is this scripture fulfilled
[1:55:40] that's when his ministry started
[1:55:42] he took the book
[1:55:44] gave it back sat down and they all
[1:55:46] scratch her head huh
[1:55:48] whoa that's heavy man
[1:55:51] I know this guy's parents how can he say
[1:55:55] all these wow wow and like so many
[1:55:58] people within the message God Has His
[1:56:02] prophets say something so profound and
[1:56:04] we sit there and go wow
[1:56:07] That's Heavy yeah it is it's strong meat
[1:56:11] it belongs to those who are of full age
[1:56:15] not little babies who are still on the
[1:56:18] sincere milk of the word huh
[1:56:22] nah well I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos
[1:56:26] ah the Apostle Paul got so sick of them
[1:56:29] I'm so sick of you guys one says I'm a
[1:56:32] Paul are you not yet babes I like that
[1:56:36] he said you're still babes he didn't put
[1:56:38] him out he didn't call him serpent seed
[1:56:41] he didn't he didn't reject him he said
[1:56:43] you're still babes having the sincere
[1:56:45] milk of the word talking about the
[1:56:47] goodness of God laying on of hands and
[1:56:49] everything he said but God has given us
[1:56:52] a Ministry that is far greater let's go
[1:56:54] beyond laying on of hands let's go
[1:56:57] beyond the doctrine of Christ let's go
[1:56:59] on unto perfection
[1:57:06] brother Ram said hear ye him Phoenix
[1:57:10] placing of a son
[1:57:12] take him out to a certain place have a
[1:57:14] ceremony before angels
[1:57:16] Place him positionally what he is in the
[1:57:19] body of Christ then that person has the
[1:57:22] authority because when you come to your
[1:57:25] place
[1:57:26] it gives you power for authority
[1:57:29] if you're not in your place no Authority
[1:57:34] let me say this if you count me a
[1:57:36] fanatic from this night on
[1:57:39] that the very same thing that I'm
[1:57:40] speaking of will be done there'll be a
[1:57:43] power
[1:57:44] put into the church and is now coming in
[1:57:48] that the holy spirit will soonoint the
[1:57:51] people till they'll speak to word and
[1:57:53] it'll create itself right there
[1:57:56] we haven't seen Powers like likes coming
[1:57:59] into the church now
[1:58:01] I know it for a fact
[1:58:04] say to this mountain don't doubt in your
[1:58:07] heart but believe that what you've said
[1:58:09] will come to pass
[1:58:12] you can have what you have said the
[1:58:15] placing of the church in position where
[1:58:18] the fullness of the power of the Holy
[1:58:19] Ghost comes into the church then critics
[1:58:22] mouths will be stopped it'll be a short
[1:58:25] time
[1:58:26] brother rum talks about short quick work
[1:58:28] of the Bride
[1:58:29] he said watch what you've seen
[1:58:31] temporarily
[1:58:33] will manifest before this thing is over
[1:58:35] in the fullness of its power
[1:58:43] second Timothy 3 16 says for all
[1:58:46] scriptures given by the inspiration of
[1:58:48] God
[1:58:49] as profitable for Doctrine for reproof
[1:58:51] for correction and for instruction in
[1:58:53] righteousness
[1:58:55] all scripture is given by the
[1:58:57] inspiration of God
[1:58:59] second Samuel 23 verse 2 the spirit of
[1:59:02] the Lord spake by me and his word was in
[1:59:05] my tongue
[1:59:10] prophets are mouthpieces
[1:59:13] what comes out of the prophet's mouth is
[1:59:16] a sharp two-edged sword
[1:59:19] which is the word of God
[1:59:21] that spiritual anointing the spirit was
[1:59:24] giving an utterance
[1:59:26] and the spirit was making an
[1:59:28] announcement
[1:59:30] see the spirit of the Lord speak by me
[1:59:34] and his word was in my mouth
[1:59:37] second Peter 1 verses 20 and 21 knowing
[1:59:40] this verse
[1:59:42] that no Prophecy of the scriptures of
[1:59:45] any private interpretation for the
[1:59:47] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[1:59:50] will of man
[1:59:51] but the holy men of God spake as they
[1:59:54] were moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:59:57] now watch the Holy Ghost is the
[1:59:59] anointing are we together on that that
[2:00:01] is the Christ of God
[2:00:02] that is the anointing
[2:00:06] and he and he alone then is the Divine
[2:00:08] revealer of the word
[2:00:10] so when the spirit of God moves Upon A
[2:00:13] man the man is the channel that God uses
[2:00:16] to bring an announcement or thus saith
[2:00:18] the Lord
[2:00:19] it's not the man speaking but God
[2:00:22] speaking through that vessel
[2:00:26] you know in the Bible
[2:00:28] the word of the Lord is used
[2:00:31] 234 times and the word of the Lord came
[2:00:35] unto Jeremiah or one of the prophets and
[2:00:38] the word of the Lord came I want you to
[2:00:41] understand that the word of the Lord
[2:00:42] that actually when you go and look at it
[2:00:44] in the correct Hebrew form
[2:00:47] and the word of the Lord
[2:00:49] it actually is translated in Hebrew and
[2:00:52] the word of the Lord became
[2:00:55] Jeremiah
[2:00:58] the word of the Lord became Ezekiel
[2:01:01] in other words when the word of the Lord
[2:01:03] comes what does it do it connects you to
[2:01:06] deity
[2:01:08] when you catch Revelation from God and
[2:01:11] the word of the Lord enlightening you
[2:01:13] giving you understanding you know what
[2:01:15] you're doing the word of the Lord is
[2:01:18] becoming
[2:01:28] what does that make you
[2:01:31] what kind of a person are you
[2:01:35] that God would reveal something to you
[2:01:39] that he would share with you his mind
[2:01:43] what kind of a person are you that God
[2:01:46] would give you his thoughts
[2:01:49] I'll tell you what kind of person you
[2:01:51] are
[2:01:52] you're a God person
[2:01:56] because is it not written in your Bible
[2:01:59] that to he whom the word of the Lord
[2:02:01] comes to
[2:02:03] are ye not gods
[2:02:06] then why do you crucify me
[2:02:09] when I say
[2:02:12] because it is written
[2:02:14] he are gods
[2:02:17] now I tell you what US older men when we
[2:02:20] have our breakfast on Monday morning
[2:02:23] it used to be the golden boys because we
[2:02:26] met at the Golden Corral
[2:02:28] so that's what they call this The Golden
[2:02:30] Boys
[2:02:32] then they closed that down so we had to
[2:02:34] go somewhere else and
[2:02:35] pretty soon you know it was the
[2:02:37] old-timer's table and
[2:02:39] you know we had all kinds of names for
[2:02:41] it but ever since I preached
[2:02:44] on ye our Gods here several months ago
[2:02:47] you know what the what the name of the
[2:02:49] the group that gathers on Monday morning
[2:02:51] for breakfast
[2:02:53] what is it Scotty
[2:02:55] table
[2:02:58] of the Gods
[2:03:05] and we have some heavy discussions
[2:03:09] man I'll tell you what when brother Paul
[2:03:11] love all started yes yes oh the wrong
[2:03:14] let me tell you yes you ever seen him
[2:03:16] get excited he's always that way
[2:03:20] hey I was reading the other day and man
[2:03:22] I'll tell you what I couldn't hardly I
[2:03:25] mean Hey listen
[2:03:28] I'd rather sit across from Brother Paul
[2:03:30] than next to him when I'm eating because
[2:03:33] of Boom I'll tell you what yeah look at
[2:03:35] you this is what God saw me oh so good
[2:03:38] Flames come on
[2:03:41] I love it I love it I love to see
[2:03:44] somebody that enjoys ah I'd love to see
[2:03:47] somebody that says preach it to me
[2:03:48] preacher I love it give me somebody that
[2:03:51] says that's me give it to somebody that
[2:03:54] gets excited
[2:03:56] hey that's right
[2:04:00] that's right not just sitting there well
[2:04:01] you know yes that's good
[2:04:04] Hallelujah
[2:04:06] praise God
[2:04:13] yeah
[2:04:14] and Dave fallick too he's another one
[2:04:17] you get Dave when when Dave gets onto a
[2:04:20] deep subject
[2:04:21] uh brother Ron I just have one question
[2:04:26] oh yeah
[2:04:28] the theophany
[2:04:30] of God and then he just goes off and
[2:04:32] this you know long you know what's your
[2:04:36] question
[2:04:37] I don't have a question I'm just telling
[2:04:39] you
[2:04:41] the table
[2:04:43] of the Gods
[2:04:45] I want you to understand what does it
[2:04:48] make you my brother my sister
[2:04:51] that God in this end time would send
[2:04:53] unto you a prophet
[2:04:56] because he knew that the word he's
[2:05:00] preaching
[2:05:01] you would receive
[2:05:03] and you wouldn't understand it all
[2:05:05] in fact and many times it would be a
[2:05:08] quandary it would be something that you
[2:05:10] would question oh that's that that's
[2:05:13] hard
[2:05:14] Paul said many things that were hard to
[2:05:17] be understood is that right
[2:05:22] so this anointing is actually the word
[2:05:25] of God being made known to you
[2:05:28] we call it faith
[2:05:30] we call it revelation we call it the
[2:05:32] quickening power of God
[2:05:34] and for the first time that it's ever
[2:05:36] seen in the Bible is Genesis 15. the
[2:05:40] first time in the word of the Lord ever
[2:05:41] came to anyone
[2:05:42] Genesis 15.
[2:05:46] and after these things the word of the
[2:05:48] Lord came unto Abram in a vision
[2:05:51] and Abraham said Lord God what will thou
[2:05:54] give me
[2:05:55] seeing I go childless and the steward of
[2:05:58] my house is Eliza of Damascus Lord you
[2:06:01] appeared to me you told me I'm going to
[2:06:03] have a son
[2:06:06] but I go childless
[2:06:10] and Abram said behold to me those given
[2:06:13] no seed and lo one born in my house is
[2:06:17] mine heir
[2:06:19] why has gone on in into Hagar
[2:06:22] according to the law he could do it
[2:06:26] behold the word of the Lord
[2:06:29] came into him saying this shall not be
[2:06:31] thine air
[2:06:33] but he that shall come forth out of
[2:06:36] thine own bowels
[2:06:38] shall be thine air
[2:06:40] correcting his idea of the way he
[2:06:45] thought God was going to do it many
[2:06:47] times God will allow you to go and go
[2:06:50] into something and and have a permissive
[2:06:52] will and God by his grace will come to
[2:06:55] you and he said this is not the way you
[2:06:58] thought
[2:06:59] it's not the way I was going to do it
[2:07:02] for you hang on
[2:07:04] why are you so quick on the trigger
[2:07:08] can't you wait they that wait upon the
[2:07:11] Lord
[2:07:12] while we get nervous
[2:07:14] we have to do something
[2:07:16] we have to produce something we have to
[2:07:18] manufacture so
[2:07:20] because you know what if if there's not
[2:07:22] something going on well something's
[2:07:24] wrong something's wrong somebody jumped
[2:07:26] somebody shouts somebody do something
[2:07:27] man
[2:07:32] yeah
[2:07:35] that's right
[2:07:36] there is a time to be still
[2:07:39] and know that I am God
[2:07:45] so this anointing that came upon him
[2:07:47] that's the grace of God
[2:07:49] Came Upon Abel
[2:07:53] Came Upon Seth
[2:07:55] Came Upon all the lineage of God all the
[2:07:57] way down and it was Christ
[2:08:00] that's why Brethren preaches those
[2:08:01] sermons The identified Christ of all
[2:08:04] ages
[2:08:06] who is it it's Christ it's that
[2:08:08] anointing it's no different today
[2:08:12] I can tell all of you today with an
[2:08:14] assurance in my heart I have found the
[2:08:17] Christ of God
[2:08:20] and it's called the message of the hour
[2:08:23] and it wasn't William Branham
[2:08:29] no
[2:08:30] he says I am a son of man
[2:08:34] revealing to you
[2:08:36] these in a man don't you dare worship
[2:08:39] Mary
[2:08:40] don't you baptize in my name don't you
[2:08:42] think I'm somebody I'm nobody
[2:08:45] I am but a voice
[2:08:47] crying out in this end time Wilderness
[2:08:50] huh don't you look to me why there'll be
[2:08:53] a spiritness in time that will anoint
[2:08:56] some to make them worship
[2:08:58] the messenger
[2:09:00] remember who Shadrach Meshach and
[2:09:03] Abednego refused to Bow their their need
[2:09:06] to it was an image to Daniel
[2:09:11] why he's the prophet of the Hour come on
[2:09:14] man everybody we should worship we
[2:09:16] should worship let's worship William
[2:09:17] Branham Let's uh come on everybody here
[2:09:19] let's be thankful
[2:09:26] I was in Cote d'Ivoire
[2:09:30] Ivory Coast
[2:09:32] having a meeting
[2:09:34] we have maybe 1500 2 000 believers
[2:09:39] and we had quite a meeting and and
[2:09:40] here's a sea of black faces
[2:09:43] when we come out of the meeting here's a
[2:09:46] whole other group of people there with a
[2:09:48] a picture
[2:09:51] that's probably half the size of that
[2:09:52] screen a picture of brother Brennan with
[2:09:55] a pillar of fire above his head
[2:09:56] and then they all got bunch of small
[2:09:59] photos of brother Branham and we come
[2:10:01] out of the meeting and they are chanting
[2:10:04] Branham is God Branham is God Branham is
[2:10:10] God Branham is God
[2:10:15] and they claim to believe the same
[2:10:18] message you do
[2:10:22] it is a fanatical element it is an
[2:10:25] antichrist Spirit brother random said to
[2:10:28] make me Jesus Christ is to make me
[2:10:30] Antichrist
[2:10:31] see we're not afraid to say that
[2:10:34] what is it he said there will be a
[2:10:37] spirit in the end time that will anoint
[2:10:39] some to believe that and actually when
[2:10:42] brother Branham first saw it he said it
[2:10:45] made me want to repent of my Ministry
[2:10:47] until God showed me that's the way
[2:10:50] they've done it before and he says and
[2:10:52] when I see it happening again now I
[2:10:55] understand
[2:10:59] okay
[2:11:01] all right now I'm going to try to bring
[2:11:03] this to a close
[2:11:04] wow
[2:11:07] yeah
[2:11:09] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2:11:12] I might have part three
[2:11:15] because listen when you eat so much
[2:11:18] you know the first time that you eat and
[2:11:21] you go to the smorgasbord and it's all
[2:11:22] you can eat your first plate
[2:11:25] yeah potatoes and the meat now I'm one
[2:11:28] of these my wife she likes to pick a
[2:11:30] little bit of this and a little bit of
[2:11:31] that I pass up all the nonsense

[2:11:37] veggies and everything like that but I
[2:11:39] get this stuff yeah yeah come on get out
[2:11:41] of my way

[2:11:48] because she oh a little bit of this and
[2:11:51] she takes that spoon and goes and
[2:11:54] and then she gets another spoon
[2:11:58] and I'm going
[2:12:00] come on
[2:12:02] I mean get a big spoonful the first time
[2:12:05] right
[2:12:07] so I bypass all of this I go right for
[2:12:09] the good stuff and no matter how good

[2:12:13] that listen I take the first bite wow oh
[2:12:17] my I hum when I eat when I like what I

[2:18:58] I didn't ask for no update
[2:19:01] I guess what all those files I don't
[2:19:05] have auto save
[2:19:06] on I don't have auto save on there so
[2:19:10] oh I start frantically searching ah
[2:19:17] what's the matter
[2:19:21] still
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:29] isn't that terrible
[2:19:32] you spent hours and hours and hours of
[2:19:36] study and prayer and you you get it
[2:19:38] ready and you're there now if I can get
[2:19:41] somebody now I think in the upper left
[2:19:44] hand
[2:19:45] corner there is a thing that says auto
[2:19:48] save
[2:19:51] turn it on
[2:19:53] but does that save every document I
[2:19:56] don't know
[2:19:57] that is the mystery yet to be revealed
[2:20:00] by somebody who can help the old-timer
[2:20:05] to know these things
[2:20:06] because it frustrates me
[2:20:10] okay I send a document I sent I sent my
[2:20:15] I'll give you an example I sent my notes
[2:20:17] as I send all of my notes I know where
[2:20:20] to I've been sending on the same way all
[2:20:23] these years and notes get sent and
[2:20:25] everything so brother yes it comes into
[2:20:27] the back of the room Hey Brother wrong
[2:20:29] where's your notes
[2:20:31] oh no no no I said them
[2:20:33] uh no we didn't get your notes oh no no
[2:20:36] no no come here I take my
[2:20:39] well here here it is yeah
[2:20:43] yeah well you said it wrong
[2:20:46] no I didn't send it wrong I hate to
[2:20:48] admit that I'm wrong
[2:20:53] anyway
[2:20:54] that's why I need some of these guys
[2:20:57] because I'm a I'm an old-timer I do
[2:21:00] things by repetition I've always done it
[2:21:02] this way
[2:21:04] I've always opened up this document I
[2:21:06] always say it's from Ron Peterson I
[2:21:09] click yes I go to evening light I press
[2:21:12] in E all of a sudden evening light comes
[2:21:14] on yes boom go to my document save send
[2:21:18] hallelujah it's sent
[2:21:20] but then when it's not there
[2:21:24] Matthew help me
[2:21:28] right
[2:21:29] so
[2:21:31] then yes it comes in there I think it's
[2:21:33] a real simple brother Ron
[2:21:35] you're sending it to eating like
[2:21:38] fellowship.com you need to send it to
[2:21:40] eveninglight.fellowship.com
[2:21:44] oh yeah why didn't you tell me
[2:21:48] well I'm telling you now
[2:21:50] well don't tell me now tell me when I
[2:21:52] get home
[2:21:53] because at 70 years of age
