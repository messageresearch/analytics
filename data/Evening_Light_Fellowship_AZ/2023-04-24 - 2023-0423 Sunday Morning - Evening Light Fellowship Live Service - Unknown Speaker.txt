called them unto him and said suffered little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall I know Wise enter therein amen so we do not baptize infants we dedicate them amen and we ask God to watch over them and to keep them all the days of their life amen oh yeah look ah

I I do say they're all so beautiful amen amen let us stand right now I'd like to sing only believe I need the Lord to help me this morning to take whatever he has placed within my heart to be able to transfer it that's what the holy spirit's supposed to do to the word because the word within itself is a dead letter but when the Holy Spirit takes that word it makes it alive it becomes a living reality father now in the name of Jesus [Music] almighty God we come to you and we ask father that you will take the word and you would anoint it to our understanding o God Let It Be Alive as you took the bread and you broke it on that day on the road to Emmaus and they compelled you to stay with them we say stay with us here in the this dark and dying and lateness of our I ask father break the bread of life to us let us eat and live I pray we ask these things for your glory amen oh [Music] things are possible on me [Music] feed me oh for all things are possible [Music] only believe God bless you just remain standing now as thank you musicians amen I'd like you to turn with me into the book of second Samuel second Samuel chapter 22. verses 29 through 33. amen what I would like to do this morning we don't do it often but I would like to read this together as a congregation brother Jeremiah's good debut here with us too God bless you your wife your little one good to have you back here home with us amen we only loaned you out but that's okay might take a little bit until you get back but that's all right we we love you buddy um second Samuel chapter 22 we're going to read it together in unison if we could we'll start at verse 29. for thou art my lamp O Lord and the Lord will light my darkness for by Thee I have run through a troop by my God have I leaped over a wall as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him for who is God save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect somebody say Amen to that God bless you you can be seated this morning in his presence amen God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect amen Ada put a smile on every one of your faces this morning I don't care what kind of Trials you're going through I don't care what you're facing but listen when you follow him he makes your way perfect Hallelujah Matthew Chapter 5 if you would Matthew 5 verse 48. Jesus speaking to his disciples there Matthew 5 48 be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen turn with me if you would to the book of Hebrews chapter 5. Hebrews 5 12-14 then we'll read Hebrews 6 1-2 Hebrews chapter 5 verse 12. for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who be by reason of use notice the word of God it's very explicit those who are full of age who by reason of use you have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil 6 verse 1. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptisms and of the laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment this will we do if God permit may God permit it this morning I pray in Jesus name amen may God bless his word I would like to title my sermon and it's something that I want you to understand of what God is doing right now we see what God has done many times we look forward to what God will do but we miss what God is doing and as it was in the days of Jesus Christ himself we know there came a time when his ministry changed when it was no longer the attraction was no longer the feeding the thousands with a couple loaves of bread and some fish but it was a time of Separation there came a time when God was no longer causing all of them to gather but now they were coming to the threshing floor and God began to separate and we are now in a time of Separation we can see it it's a time that the shuck is no longer air with the wheat and so um I want to not only talk about the ministry of Jesus Christ and the ministry of the prophet of this hour but about the last day Ministry we want to talk about the ministry of the bride and I want to title it this morning the bride is now moving into a Perfection Ministry and I take a subject by faith the bride is moving into his perfection catch that into his perfection now I remember as a young Christian having read where Jesus said be ye perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect and as a young man I thought well if he said it I guess that's what we need to do and so I can remember thinking all right today I'm going to have a perfect day I'm gonna keep everything under control I'm going to do everything that I can to have a perfect time before God and let me tell you just shortly after getting out of bed everything falls apart and you realize that this Perfection that you're trying to achieve or attain to in the flesh is so very elusive huh you may think you're perfect until a trial comes somebody cuts you off uh somebody jumps in front of you at the the bank somebody cuts in line I said that's when you need to have character amen otherwise it'd be heaps of Ashes everywhere God doesn't want you to misuse his power maybe you will say I forgive you that's okay go ahead and cut in front of me and be rude but I forgive you anyway I've always been intrigued by the subject of perfection because it's something that God requires and each one of you must be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect and I've always pondered over this and and wondered within my heart what does it mean to be perfect before God and one thing that I can say with an assurity in my heart if God said for us to be perfect then there is a way that God has made for us to attain perfection God will never ask you or require of you something for you to do without giving you the ability to be able to come to that he doesn't want everyone to flunk he doesn't rejoice when people miss it so there must be a way because he is Jehovah Jireh he is a God that provides for all of our needs and if you need a way to be able to be perfect in the eyes of God then God must provide a way for that perfection if God in heaven is perfect then he's expecting us to have that same perfection but he must provide the way now brother Branham in 1954 begins to now illustrate to us how God is going to do this and he titles his sermons accordingly here is a sermon called God perfecting his church 1954. so we give God praise tonight to know that the holy spirit is in US last night I was teaching of the perfection God perfecting his church bringing the church into Perfection through the Lord Jesus Christ notice his wording he's bringing the church through something so this is how God will do it that's how we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed as heirs according to the promise and we are perfected not in our own selves not in our own holiness someone said to me not long ago brother Branham do you believe in Holiness I I said yes sir without such no man shall see God I said but not my holiness because I have not any I believe in his holiness something that he has done and it's that I rest my hopes upon not in my own merits I have none I rest upon his merits having this assurance as he loves me I love him and the whole thing becomes a love affair it's not because of the law it's because of love to fully understand what God is telling us then we've got to go to the scripture but though we read the scripture and we look of what he he talks about perfection it still takes the Holy Spirit to come and make this alive to us because we want to know how can we be perfect before God and I began to look at several men within the scriptures the Bible says was a perfect man there are four examples within the word one is Noah one is Abraham and one is job all of those were said they were perfect before God but there is a fourth one that is very perplexing his name is called or his title is the king of Tyrus his name is Lucifer the Bible says in Ezekiel 28 verses 12-15 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus saith the Lord God thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty now may I stop there for a moment the prophet of God told us that God dwells in character not in Beauty so whoever this is what his Perfection is is in Beauty but the beauty of Christ is the character of Christ in the people thou has been in Eden in the garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the sardius the topaz and the diamond the Burl the Onyx and the Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold and the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so thou West upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day thou was created till iniquity was found in thee and so here was a man the king of Tyrus it does not give us his name in the scripture so brother Branham picks this very scripture up and in 1959 questions and answers watch this watch the evil controls the world now as we read from Ezekiel 28-12 verse 12. son of man take up the lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him and we read that scripture now you know the king of Tyrus at that time could have not have been in Eden for it was four thousand years before that see thou has been in Eden who's he talking to he's talking to Satan in that King Hallelujah brother I feel religion religious and if you go on there in the next couple quotes the brother Branham says you know what his name is his name is Lucifer and so you have three there are three men and another man and he was perfect in his ways but until iniquity was found in him so the first time in the Bible that a man was called perfect is found in the Book of Genesis Genesis 6 verse 9. these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God Perfection there comes from the Hebrew word tomam it means entire without blemish complete full perfect undefiled an upright before God and then I began to look up the word perfect in the New Testament it is called teleos in Greek and it means having reached an end come to a destination reached your goal now I want all of you to understand that God has called you unto himself and each one of you have a Godly positioning system within you just like your cell phone has a GPS your car has a GPS that is a system that man has made and through satellites which are false Stars and things of information but all of a sudden you go outside you turn your GPS on and through trigonometry it does uh all of these equations and finds out within just less than two or three feet where you're at follow this now now God has put not a GPS not a global but a Godly positioning system in each one of your lives and regardless of how many wrong turns you make what happens when you make a wrong turn on a regular GPS it recalculates so I want you to understand it doesn't matter how many times that you have to recalculate hopefully you're not making that many but when you do God knows and he's going to bring you to destination he's going to bring you to teleos to the goal to the destination to the place that he has chosen God has provided a way God would be unjust for him to ask you to be perfect and there's no way for you to achieve it he would make you all very frustrated and and and and depressed because he wants me to be perfect and if there's any of us here that are really honest with ourselves we see I know I am not perfect are there any honest people oh there's more honest over here than over here how about any oh God help us Noah the Bible says what's just in an upright man up until this time as Generations had been pure and undefiled before God I want to look at another scripture as we just kind of walk along this morning in Genesis chapter 17 verse 1. and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God when you look up the word almighty God that name it means El Shaddai I am the breasted one I am the all-sufficient god walk before me and be thou perfect wow I want you to understand here is El Shaddai the all-sufficient god coming to Abram here before the promise was even brought to pass in his life before the seed came forth here El Shaddai I want you to understand that God knows what you're going through he knows the situation you face but you have to put your trust in God that he that called you is bringing you to your destination if he asks you to be perfect he's got to make a way the Lord appeared to him as El Shaddai God was looking at his faith and could see his faith transformed itself into words and by his Works was his faith made perfect how many of you know that that it wasn't until he was taking the knife to slay his son and he can you imagine now the quandary that Abraham is going through he waits all those years for the promise to come to pass and then God tells him to go up the mountain to the place I will show you of and I want you to go there and sacrifice your son I want to ask you does the the god of the Old Testament believe in human sacrifice think of this and so here Abraham is he's he's searching through his mind how can God who is The Giver of Life and the promise and I've waited and it was by an Angel and and the visitations of God and I'm going to have a son and now I finally have the son and he wants me to to sacrifice my own son and the Bible says and he went to the place that he had seen in a vision he goes to the place and when he sees the place so far off he tells the the other men the young boys that were with him you stay here I in the lad will go and make sacrifice and we shall reach he's prophesied he's already under the anointing of God I don't understand it I don't know how God is going to do it but if he asks me to do it it is me to say yea and amen Isaac says I I see the altar I see the wood by the way he carried his own wood up the mountain Christ carried his own wooden cross you see the type father I see the altar I see the wood where is the sacrifice he says God will provide himself a sacrifice I want you to understand that when you understand biblical principles God will ask you to maybe go somewhere and go to a place it's not so much as strategic location it may be a time in your life oh I'm to the place and then understand that God has called you to the place and he gave you a purpose he was to go and sacrifice and when you get those two lined up you'll know that God will provide but the lamb that was caught in the thicket in the Briars it wasn't there until the first two lined up I'm at the place I know the purpose and all of a sudden he takes his hand Isaac gets there and he takes the power to the to the hand and then God speaks stay thy hand Abraham for now I know thou death love me wait a second you mean the omnipotent God an omniscient God who knows all things does not know that Abraham loves him does he have to wait what it is is Abraham has to prove his love to God and then God said I receive it and it's imputed unto you for righteousness I want you to understand how faith is a gift of God but it must be put into action faith without works is dead you tell me you have faith I must see the works of God in your life otherwise it's just a profession it must be a possession it must be something that you actually say if I'm a Believer I want to see fruits John the Baptist said you say that you've repented bring forth fruits of repentance amen walk before me and be thou perfect works is the outward manifestation of your faith your works as Faith expressed James 2 verses 21 through 26 was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar seeth thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect here's that word perfection and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God that's what believers do they believe and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see then how by works a man is Justified and not by faith only because otherwise we could all say okay okay it's all Faith it's all Revelation it's all God doing it so therefore I'm going to sit back and all I got to do is to say it's faith and then I don't do nothing about putting my faith into action amen you just become a a lazy person that says well it's all Grace it's nothing but Grace and therefore I'm just going to because God's doing it and you don't put your faith into action and not by faith only likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works and you know what I want to ask you her Works was to lie when she hid The Messengers what happened to him well they went that way well they went that way she lied you mean God could have somebody to lie and still be in the will of God be careful and for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead show me a man who claims to believe God and I will show you a man that his faith will be manifested in his actions his word and his walk when we talk about walking with God your Christian walk is all inclusive in its meaning it means in everything in all manner of life and of speech and of actions and the daily life all of that is Walking with God we just don't walk on Sunday morning we don't come here to church and put on our halo and act so holy you know I've had people come here to church and you know somebody has testified to him and they've come and they feel a little out of place among such a holy people have you ever heard that before somebody maybe witnessed to somebody off of the street and they come in here and they go oh I feel so odd because the people are so holy and then you tell them we see that sister over there you should have seen what she was like before God got it see this brother over here he was a drug dealer see this guy over there no you're just looking at a washed up product one is God is cleansed huh because there for the grace of God go I it was God that watched over you it was God that cleanse you there ain't nobody in here that's holy there ain't nobody in here that's got some kind of Halo it was everything that you did no God knew he would have faults and failures and yet God made a way for you to be perfect before him [Applause] so just join the group ain't nobody here was born with a Halo amen stop there for a moment whenever God speaks to Abraham it says in God Appears unto Abraham and it causes Abraham to bring forth a manifestation every time God Appears to Abraham he pulls another word attribute out of him in Genesis 12 God speaks to him to move out of his country and away from his family to seek a city whose Builder and maker is God is that right and so God Appears to him the Bible says and God Appears to him and he builds an altar and altars were built in the Old Testament as a place of sacrifice brother Brown says find altars in the Old Testament and I'll show you a church I'll show you somewhere where people are coming to make sacrifice that's why we're coming here this morning you could have stayed home you could have streamed the service you could have stayed in your bedroom and washed it from your bed in your pajamas but you had to make a sacrifice amen going to church is a commitment serving God is a commitment forsake not the assembling together of the brethren in this last days why we come here why because we are committed to the cause of Christ we make a sacrifice and I say to all of you thank you for your sacrifice and without a sacrifice there's no blessing God Appears to him and he builds an altar Alters the type of church because he calls the place Bethel meaning the house of God so when God Appears to Abraham he begins to call upon the name of the Lord and that appearing is what caused him to do it that's the first time that Abraham calls on the name of the Lord so this appearing had to call this calling out of him when God calls you he calls you out of your family he calls you out of all of these things to say I bid you to come come unto me come unto me O ye that are weary in her heavy lead I will give you rest but actually when you come to become a disciple for Christ he says he who seeks to save his life shall lose it but he who seeks to lose his life she'll find it there's a cost to being a disciple it's called Death to sell and he who loves father mother sister brother more than me is not worthy of the Kingdom if there had been no appearing there would be no manifestation in Abraham's life so I want you to understand the word appear in Hebrew it actually means is the word Raw r-a-a-h it means to see to discern to experience to catch the vision of and God appeared unto Abraham and what God is doing giving him the ability to see something to discerning to experience it to catch the vision of it Abraham was actually Experiencing God he was Discerning God he was catching a vision of God I want you to understand that he was having this experience and when he God Appears to him the next thing is he has a desire to go to church and to call on the name of the Lord it was God's appearing to him that caused that word attribute to come out of him let me be so bold as to say each one of you as God Appears to you now let's take this appearing and call it a revealing an unveiling a time when Faith Comes upon you what it is is when God Appears at that time he's bringing another portion of himself something that was deep inside the seed do you understand what he's doing he's bringing the life which is his life out of the seed causing you to do something and you might not even known it was there but God rich in Mercy knowing that that sea Gene is down inside of you and when the light shines upon that seed if it is ordained to life because children of life are energized by light Hallelujah there is a we learned in in in biology that plant life has a way to take sunlight and to change it into energy it is called photosynthesis in other words the cells on the leaves of the trees and the plants and the flowers and everything that has botany life when the light strikes it it begins to come forth what is it it is photosynthesis what is happening to you sitting here right now is God giving you light God giving you understanding because when God opens your mind and the light turns off and you catch it guess what it's causing life sister Jen Oldham when I first met her you you all remember sister Jan and everything she uh she sewed the clothing for the Catholic church that she was a member of and Dennis of course he had married her and everything like that well they they kind of had this thing well if I go to your church will you go to mine yeah kind of a Let's Make a Deal thing and so she comes to church and she sits there with her hoop earrings and her makeup and everything because you know what she's a good Catholic okay she's a good person just doesn't know any different so she sits there and she comes to meet me after service I'll have you points your finger I'll have you to know and I don't care what you say you're not going to change me I saw the clothing for our priests I go in and guess how many rituals that our priest does to put on the clothing before service and yeah wow okay great I don't have any special clothing and there's nothing anointed about this tie so anyway she comes to church a few times everything and I'm watching and the earrings are gone nobody told her nobody pointed her finger nobody said oh my God she has earrings no hey quit looking you're down your nose to somebody before God gives them string in this hour so she met me after church after a couple months of coming and this and that what are you doing to me we are doing something I don't know what it is but you're doing something no let me tell you it was not me doing it what it was was God by way of the Holy Spirit giving her an appearing and when the appearing is coming it's flashing the light upon the seed and when it does she comes forth off go the earrings off go the clothing off to those things what is it it's God pulling the life nobody can change you except God you can change your church you can change how you believe but it takes God to change your heart amen in Genesis 18 we see Abraham again in the plains of memory God Appears to him and he has foot washing and communion with Melchizedek and he pays ties do you see the attributes how did he know how to pay tithes I'll tell you what because there was something in the lines of Abraham Levi was saying pay ties because the Bible says Levi yet in the loins of Abraham whoa you mean to tell me God see Gene is down inside and even before it was manifest there was something in Levi in an unmanifested seed yet to come to life was already telling Abraham pay ties hello Melchizedek ever who he was he still is because there was no beginning of days or end of life oh I tell you every time God Appears to his children something happens I'm asking God God appear to someone here this morning in a special way to show them give them Revelation give them understanding that the Bible will become alive to them and that Bible will become a living epistle some people will never come to church but they will look to you for a life you live um they may never walk in these doors but they may look at your life and say I don't know what it is about you but I want whatever you got Lord let me live a life before the people that the people see number one that I have Joy about what I believe huh to be baptized with the Holy Spirit not lemon juice not a Sour Puss but something that it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory there's something inside of me that every time God Appears guess what Hallelujah amen it quickens and energizes me what is it doing the same thing it did to Abraham the same thing that it did to every seed genocide it's pulling the god life that's hidden that's invisible that is placed there inside of you before the foundation of the world you didn't even know it who is this Melchizedek who do you say this is God manifesting himself once again to the promised son God does this for a purpose to get a bride ready for the rapture God had to come down make a way for Abraham and for Sarah to change their bodies Abraham could no longer produce the seed impossible Sarah's womb as good as dead in their flesh it was no longer possible to bring forth the promised seed and I want all of you to understand understand this biblical principle when it's impossible for man it's probable for God Waits until you can't produce it are you done Abraham have you tried everything yeah I listened to Sarah went into Hagar brought forth a wild man can't even get him to go to church all he does is make fun of come on yeah I'm done you know what God sometimes wants you to admit I'm finished I have done I have tried everything humanly impossible to bring to pass what I need okay God I'm done I'm finished God lets you to go until you have exhausted all of your human resources and it says are you done yeah he says good now let go and let God there have been times in all of our lives and if you haven't come to that place in your life at some time or another you will so learn the lesson before otherwise if you're a hard learner and don't buy don't listen by us telling you don't touch the stove it's hot I believe you dad I believe you or if you're the son how hot how hot dad will it really burn what does it feel like to be burned don't touch it son you'll get you'll get burned I told you I'm a pastor I see people don't do it don't touch it I told you I never liked my mama to say I told you so huh listen if you can't make things work out ask Mama again okay you didn't catch that think about it because sometimes Mama doesn't know she's got a yeah okay son go ahead but you're gonna learn ah do you know what mamas do also you hard-headed kids that dude wouldn't learn by them telling you so they tell you any of you give your mom and dad a hard time when you as a little kid you don't raise your hand because you know I'm talking to you right now yeah yeah oh God help us our kids and and you were one of those rebellious and you can't tell me and so your mother you know what she did she put a curse on you son when you get married and you have children may they be just like you oh God forbid gonna teach you a lesson and you're going to get a son with a double portion it's amazing it is amazing how many of these newly married couples that we can't wait to have kids can't wait and some of you you have the most darling cute lovely obedient little child and your first one is so easy oh man you can't wait to have a dozen more but the second one what did I do to deserve this they've come out of the same basket God knows just what to do and I tell you what your children will humble you they will why I said all that but it was for somebody here so just listen now watch Abraham's faith was anointed by Melchizedek to come to perfection come to the destination come to the goal come to the completeness so turn with me also Acts chapter 26 we'll see another time when God Appears and this time it's Saul the Pharisee Saul the Pharisee a Pharisee of Pharisees concerning the law blameless that song years ago brother Johnny the brother from Tucson he once there was a little high tempered hook nose to you who was a doctor of much degree he spent many years under well-trained men getting his PhD well on the road to Damascus one day there the pillar of of fire met Saul what happened down in the dust where he belongs what happened God meeting an elect seed huh do you remember when God came to you how many of you were actually looking for God God came looking for you he said no man seeks God he says God seeks man so here it is Acts chapter 26 15-18 and I said now here's this appearing here's a pillar of Fire and here is a Pharisee of Pharisees taught by the greatest teacher of his day by Gamaliel and I said who art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest but rise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose I want you to understand every time God Appears it has a purpose every time God give you Revelation every time light shines upon your seed it has a purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things which I will appear unto thee the delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I said thee to open their eyes to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God wow Satan is a mighty power but God Is An Almighty how much greater is light than Darkness I don't care how dark it is I don't care how dark you were shaded how many times how many how much education how much stuff how much unbelief was shrouded over that seed when Jesus met the woman at the well and the more that he spoke my words that I speak unto you they are life and the words that I speak are the light of men brother random said as he began to speak to her light penetrated the light penetrated going through her unbelief and all of the darkness and all of this and everything and well when the Messiah comes watch something when the Messiah comes he'll tell us these things she's already lights penetrating something inside of her is being pulled out of her and she can't help it she doesn't know why she's speaking you're not even supposed to be talking to Amy do not custom but the Bible says he it needs to go by way of Samaria he sent the disciples away boy you talk about them missing a a time when God's appearing to an elect seed they come back and does he know who he's talking to I imagine that's how it was when somebody started testifying to you know who he's talking to that's the worst one in the church yeah well I tell you what it was an appearing and as the light from the word of God began to penetrate the woman at the well said that when the Messiah comes he'll tell us these things woman I say unto thee that the man that speaks to you is he and the Bible says and she left her water pot very reason she went to the well had to ask me of this water she got her water pot filled not the physical water pot she got this living water within her that sprung up and she left the water pot she run into the City come see a man come see a man that told me everything though you fanatic oh just let you hang around this message long enough you'll give it up oh let me tell you you weird people you peculiar people you that have to wear a dress and you don't cut your hair and no makeup I'll give you a few months you'll throw it away how many times has people thought yeah just give you some time huh to the elect seed you can't throw them off because the closer they get to God the more appearing he does the more revealing the more understanding they get and then how they realize it's not me but it's Christ inside of me I have nothing to do with this I don't do this by my own power Paul said it's no longer I deliver but Christ that liveth in me and the works that I now do and the faith that I have is come from the faith of the Son of God I don't do it this isn't me brother Ron I can't live this message neither can I but he can live his message in me quit trying to do it yourself Peter quit trying to sail your own ship go ahead Jesus go to sleep how many of you people Let Jesus you you sing him a lullaby go to sleep go to sleep then when you have the and the waves and the wind get contrary that's okay boys hey disciples don't wake him up let him sleep I'm a fisherman I've been in Trials before I've been in Wind and Waves I've seen why back in 25 when it was much worse than this we was out and our boat was smaller hanging oh yeah yeah yeah I got it I got it you know anybody can sail in good weather I remember I was with some brothers in Germany we're sailing the Adriatic Sea one of the brothers he says sea captain he got his license that he could sail but he'd never been in rough weather and boy you know here this you know Germans they like to do everything by the books take up the anchor let loose the lines put up the seal I ain't captain and boy these guys marching around the dick doing all of this stuff aye let's do it and I look out there now I'm from the ocean and they look out between the the Rocks going out into where the ocean is at we're in the we're in the bay and there's mountains around us and the wind is swirling the cat paws are on the on the water we're reading it and I and here are we put up our seal and it sits there and it just kind of luffs that's what the seal it does it doesn't catch any windage poop oh wait hey hey and I said hey guys you see those breakers out there in the rock you see the water going push yeah it's okay come on boys so man we get out there and as soon as we come around the point where the wind caught us and we put up full seal full seal and as soon as the wind if you've ever been in a sailboat and all of a said that wind began to blow and this whole syllable now we start going through wow we're doing like 10 12 knots on top of like strike the sale turn into the wind pull down the sail turn on the engine we're going back to the harbor it took us 10 minutes or 20 minutes to get out of the harbor and we got out there and I'm telling you it was and and it looked like some kind of crazy movie everybody go real quick like this you know fast motion and we turned the boat around and what took 10 or 20 minutes took double the amount of time to get back into Harbor when we come around that little mountain the rise and the wind wow boy I ain't going out in weather like that again how many of you have had your boat all of a sudden yeah I can handle this healed over [Music] I didn't sign up for this and then we all said hey we're not sailors nah uh uh no this is not the the you know World Cup race and we're uh the Admiral's cup no no no we're Weekend Warriors we think that we can see it we can't see it we've learned from a book see Peter he thought I've been it's okay go ahead and go to sleep I want you to understand it says when it got so contrary and the ship began to sink this is this is amazing we Let Jesus sleep until we're in danger and then we help help and they go wake Jesus and the first thing that comes out of their mouth is don't you care that we perish right why didn't you wake him up before you were in trouble saints of God there are times in your life when you let him sleep when you should have first thing you did was wake him up and realize that your ship may not be able to go through this master care is not that we perish and he stood there on the bow of the boat he rebuked the wind and the waves what manner of man is this that the Seas and the wind obey him I know the master do you understand there are times in your life when you're going to have to speak to a storm you're going to have to speak to something in your life that is devastational that may take your boat and you may sink it all you got to do is put your faith and trust in God amen brother ramp says in 1962 convinced and then concern he's in our midst now there's a great big difference in the sign of Jesus appearing and Jesus coming two different words means two different things the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord the appearing of the Lord is now somebody say now that's what's happening God's doing many appearings he's appearing to you and he appears and he does and he comes on the scene he gives you revelation God is appearing now and when he's appearing in his feeble his Spirit working among them proving that it's in him that it's him with them getting them ready for the rapture for the coming of the Lord to catch away is right see the appearing in the coming God you have been appearing to this little elect lady called The Bride many appearings but only three comings so we look down through the Bible and we see many appearings but there's only three comings now I'm asking God in every one of your lives that he might appear unto you at some time to make you aware that he's with you and sometimes it takes a place of desperation for you to call him on the scene and when he does he lets you know I was there all the time God told Abraham to be thou perfect and walk before him in perfection there was another man his name was job 1 1. there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and has skewed evil twice God spoke to the enemy and said have you actually considered my servant job hmm both times he mentions job was a perfect and upper amen you see I want you to understand that in the midst of all that he went through job realized I am a failure I curse the day I was born and said because he was going through issues do not let the issues obscure your vision of who's with you but when it was all over he said though the skin worms eat my flesh in my flesh I will see God and when God gets done with me I shall come forth as pure gold amen amen this is for somebody this morning now watch Melchizedek the office of the high priest that God uses as a mediator between God and man Jesus and understand this Jesus was the man the sacrificial lamb but Melchizedek was the office of that man now follow this along in the sermon who is this monkey he says now he says he came in and lived in that person of Melchizedek he never heard we never heard no more of Melchizedek because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was the priest but he became Jesus Christ um now if he's the high priest the Bible says in Hebrews 4 follow along Hebrews 4 verses 15 14 through 5 verse 1. seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not and high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are I want all of you to understand he went through every trial so he knew what you would feel like yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of God that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin the role of the high priest was to be a mediator between God and man and through that mediator we have an ability to approach God First Timothy 2 verses 5 and 6 for there is one God and one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all to be testified in due time oh my now give me a couple minutes so I want to read to you just a couple more things but it's going to be lengthy reading so I want you to open your Bibles Hebrews chapter 9. Hebrews 9 and we're going to kind of read along here Hebrews 9 verse 1 then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service in a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick the table the showbridge which is called The Sanctuary after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holy holiest of all which had the golden sensor in the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pod that had Manna and Aaron's Rod that butted in the tables of the Covenant and over at cherubims of Glory shadowing the mercy seats which we cannot now speak particularly now when these sayings were thus ordained the priest went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once every year without blood not without blood which he offered for himself and for The Heirs of the people once a year the only one that went behind the last veil was the high priest and he had to be Anointed with blood how many knows that blood he's Anointed with oil the anointed and the oil went down off his head down his beard onto His Garment so he was annoying it had to have blood and his walk had to be holy before God and he had pomegranates and bills he had a rope tied to him and he walked holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy unto the Lord right and if they quit hearing a noise or the bills right he's dead that's why listen saints of God you don't you don't try to go behind the veil unless you're anointed and got blood see when I see the blood I will pass over you when I see the blood when I see the token when I see the life manifested inside him he said today it's no longer that vial of blood you could have the very blood of Jesus Christ right now he said it would do you no good because it's transferred to something else he said it's the life that was in the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over okay let's keep reading into the second verse 7 when the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for The Heirs of the people the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest well as the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which we offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him which that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience so in other words it was a typing Shadow and it was blood but it was blood of bulls and goats which covered sin and didn't do away with it which stood only in me strengths divers Washington's carnal ordinances impose on them until the time of reformation but Christ becoming in high Priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle we're talking about perfection here is a Greater Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us somebody say us look put yourself in there redeem now I love to Proclaim it Is Us quit making it them someone else no take the word of God and make yourself a part of it identify with it for if the blood of bulls and of goats and Ashes them and ever sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God purging your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God for this cause he the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promises of in Eternal inheritance Verse 18 whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and Scarlet wool and hiss have been sprinkled both the book and all the people this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined to you moreover he sprinkled the blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things by the Lord perch with blood without the shedding of blood is no remission is therefore necessary that the patterns the patterns of things in heaven should be purified with these but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entered into the holy place every year with the blood of others for then he must often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away the sin by the sacrifice of him so here's Jehovah Jireh and as it is appointed and a man wants to die but after this the judgment and so Christ also appeared to Bear the sins of many and under them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation now I'm going to bring this to a close here if I can give me a couple minutes brother brennam in 1955 talks about perfection to the believer he titles the name of the sermon the position of a believer in Christ the subject is perfection now how can a mortal man ever become perfected and yet God said in his word that he chose us to be holy perfected before the foundation of the world how are you going to do that and Jesus said be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect is that right now if God before the world ordained it we should be holy Without Blame and perfect in the sight of God and we struggling and murmuring and don't you think God's seen all these things he foreknew it and predestinated ordained us to be so elected us before the world was ever formed now here's how he did it in the ninth chapter 21st verse Christ being a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not made of this building neither by the blood of gods but by his own blood he has entered into once into the holy Place Heaven having obtained Eternal Redemption for us in a now he preaches 1957 he's he's on a roll now he's talking about perfection he's talking about a believer's position in Christ he titles the sermon the perfection oh what is it oh God requires perfection he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him he's looking tonight no matter how much you've sinned how little or how much you're still a sinner and you cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ God's all-sufficient sacrifice in him you are perfected forever think of it it's not nothing you do it's not new pages you turn it's not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that brings you to perfection then you are perfected in Jesus Christ how can we have perfect faith for a perfect rapture unless there is a perfect message to catch away A Perfect Bride let me tell you that's why God circumcised this message to take away all the flesh to bring forth a perfect word that's why the opening of the seals because those seals is Christ he is those seals he is the one what is God doing he's bringing for the life that was in him into the life of every believer when you come to church you're coming here that God might perfect your walk you might learn something it's not done by the first and second pull but the third pull the revealing of the word Luke chapter 13. verses 31 and 32 the same day there came certain of the Pharisees singing to him get thee out and depart thanks for Herod will kill thee and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow and the third day I shall be perfected the third day third pull revealing the word are you catching it you see the third day when I changed my Ministry go tell that old Fox yeah I'm I just don't tell nobody because if you tell them what's going I'm trying to teach Pentecostal preachers Supernatural things and what they are is a bunch of babies I'm appalling I'm of Apollos and Paul got so sigmas I'm glad I never even baptized you unless you say I baptize you in my own name brother Brandon was so tired of first and second pull until finally hey what good is it done tell them their name where they're from as far as I'm concerned I'm going up in the hills grow my hair along I'll become a Trapper forget it and then when God he did all he's got to do is tell me go down I'll give him thus saith the Lord go right back up there I think every Pastor goes through times like that tell you what what good all this preaching every Sunday and every Wednesday night and everything people don't take it so serious I just gonna go up in the mountains let me tell you you can't get away from God Paul said woven to me if I preach not the gospel lest I myself become a Castaway so the third poll is a Perfection Ministry I want to show it to you a Perfection Ministry that's why the devil is hitting the ministry because will the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the coming of the Lord yeah sure uh-huh that's right it'll be ever so simple it'll be Apostles prophets evangelists past teachers for the perfecting of the Saints till we come to the unity of the faith faith is a revelation right faith is an appearing and I'll tell you one way for us to quit all of our arguing about what this meant and what that meant and this quote and that quote just say what he said well he said yeah well he also said well quit arguing over it the only time we have real disagreements well this is what he meant by it that's not what he meant by he meant by this pretty soon your fight who cares Brethren said one said he's coming on a white horse and another says he's coming on a white cloud who cares as long as we agree he's coming stop all of this nonsense everybody don't have to see it the way I see it you don't have to eat the same kind of food I eat some of you don't like hot stuff no I love it hot I like someone I bought it it bites me back some of you you live in a hospital food Bland no salt no pepper no nothing I like someone I bite into it yeah yeah I had a jalapeno the other day Michael we were up we were up there quill hunting you remember that just up near Baghdad and jalapenos jalapenos are not really that hot now habanero and ghost pepper and all that stuff they get hot jalapeno it's more like a bell pepper to me he gave me a jalapeno and he grilled it on the grill now it was physically hot the skin was shriveled up on it brother Ron man I cooked you a jalapeno a man good I started eating it like a pickle Fire coming out of my mouth smoke coming out of my ear I couldn't talk for a couple minutes Michael goes are you okay [Music] that thing turned me Every Way but Loose hot I never thought jalapenos were so now I I take the first bite and I see how hot is that jalapeno because some jalapenos can't be hot and I like hot food how many of you like hot food yeah good come on over I I got peppers for all of you and the rest of you yeah you'll just have to have bologna and cheese and real peanut butter and jelly we'll keep it simple for you anyway God is bringing his church now I'm going to take this in the next service to another level show you that the ministry now here's what I started to see the reason the devil is attacking the ministry is because brother Branham said this ministry of Ephesians 4 is what is going to be doing to perfecting the bride but he said it's not the minister no man takes this Glory yeah you can't make it without me oh you stuff shirt no let me tell you if God ever used a minister it's because that minister yielded himself and God used him okay and God used him so we don't take this well you can't make no no Hey listen all I am is a servant and if I will get myself out of the way and I will give to you what he has given to me then it's not me giving it to you it's him giving it to you all he did was come and annoyed me while I'm in my study and I'm praying and I'm seeking God but it was all of you that your prayers last night the night before what you were going through and some of you actually turned me while I'm preaching that that no actually I like it brother Ron the reason the reason you did what you did was because I turned you yeah I knew it was you I could look at you I could see you're going yes give it to me and you take me away from my notes take me away from everything I studied and you give me pull me way out here because you want a fresh word Hallelujah that's what the ministry is to do is to bring the fresh revealed word the carcass of the hour not what I know it ain't what I know it's what I don't know it's called the Revelation that comes from God himself blessed art thou Simon barjona for fresh and blood didn't reveal this year but my Father which is in heaven when you get Revelation you're not getting enough from your pastor you're not getting it from the prophet you're getting it from God himself it's a father making himself known to you the father what's it all about Jesus did not come to reveal himself he said I can do nothing until the father reveals it to me did you know the Bible says Jesus speaking he said all things concerning me have an end I want to ask you when we go to heaven and we get up there are you going to see Jesus Christ over here and the father sitting on a throne show us the father have I been so long with you have I preached so many sermons I tell you if you've seen me you've seen the father because I and the father are one when we get over there let me tell you this Revelation that started in Christ the mystery of God so started he was a beginning of the creation of God and now he came down so that we could see him touch him we could feel him we could understand because he says Jehovah God is too mysterious him through millions and trillions of light years he could not reveal himself because he's too great your little finite mind would lock up like an old computer a 286 if you tried to put a 286 with an upgrade right now your little finite mind so what God does to you every time you come to church you sit down and you're under huh you're under the cloud catch this when you're under the cloud you begin to get upgrades it happens your cell phone doesn't hey your cell phone your computer guess what you just been upgraded you just saved you know it turned itself off and went to like this and ah I don't know about you but that that stuff it my computer it's off why'd it go off I press it oh you just been upgraded hmm all of the little faults and the little things and you get more emojis and you get on I didn't ask for emojis I didn't ask for all this I know you came to church though and you sat down and while the word is being preached under the influence because we have been encompassed by such a great cloud of witness guess what there's clouds of witnesses all throughout and guess what while you're sitting there all of a sudden get an upgrade God's changing you from Glory unto Glory from the glory of this terrestrial to the glory of the celestial Hallelujah and when you catch a revelation guess what all of a sudden you are jettisoned from this realm wow wow Lord that was so great but the problem is as we come back down don't we but one day musicians come come one day it won't happen that way take another step into that theophany take another step it's eternity calling you this message is so so Supernatural that it keeps unveiling itself the same as the Holy Scripture because you can read a spoken word book the same as you read a Bible and you can read the words on that page and it gives you so much according to your understanding because you're a babe in Christ but later you read it now as a full blown adult with mature thinking and you exercise [Music] your senses to start discerning now and then all of a sudden it reveal and you go wow why didn't I ever see that before huh it's because it's in season and there's a time and season for all things and each one of you have a certain time and season in your life and you as a little child you couldn't get it because you don't teach little children trigonometry you teach them basic math huh teach them basic math for when I was a child I thought as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things the bride is coming into a Ministry now of perfection because as his ministry changed Soma Stars that's the reason that there is so much that well hey you don't need to go to church anymore nah hey not just stay home press play is that the Bible brother Ryan said God never ordained mechanical devices to preach the gospel he said he used the element of man so people they don't go to church anymore are you still stay home I just press play no reverence I'll tell you the first ones he will sacrifice when you do that stay away from fellowship stay away from a five-fold Ministry stay away from the things that God has ordained for the and the first thing you will sacrifice are your children your children to say are you kidding me stay home and just press play and then have somebody tell you that when we get into the Eternal heavens when we get over there you're still going to press play are you kidding me such foolishness such Fables let me tell you that but I will tell you this this revelation [Music] it's going to become so strong so real and it will continually unfold itself all right can I give you a couple quotes here before I I go Brethren find these quotes here perseverance perseverance [Music] it's the elected that hears it [Music] I believe there's a church coming into that perfection the ministry of perfection where's the offices where Apostles prophets teachers pastors Vengeance for the perfecting the church them pastors teachers and so forth will be so worth the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord I believe that I believe we're nearing that time now he's making us aware of it in the sermon perseverance I believe that there's a church coming into that perfection that's the ministry of perfection oh where are the offices we're Apostles prophets teachers passing men for the perfecting of the church then pastors and teachers so we'll be so with the word I believe the whole thing will work right up to the I believe that I believe we're nearing that time now isn't that amazing wow God bless you let's Stand Together [Music] now I've got probably a couple more sermons on this and I got some really really fantastic quotes because you know what saints of God quite honestly I didn't know what the Bible said until a prophet came is he one God or three Gods is his name father son holy ghost or is it Lord Jesus Christ I didn't know I didn't know all these things I didn't know the hidden mysteries of the word of God until a prophet came and gave to us what do prophets do they reveal the word they don't add to it they reveal what is already written brother random that could be the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation oh no that would be adding to or taking away but what I believe my Ministry is is revealing what's already been written Hallelujah amen what's the name of this song here brother Robert child of the king oh yeah [Music] yeah I'm a child [Music] [Applause] who was wretching and bow now praise God [Music] back [Music] and I'm stretches [Music] praise God I adore you I adore you amen amen you saw me in my knees

[Music] you Heavenly Father Lord we commit this service into thy hands of God I pray May each one that is here today perhaps those on the internet those who will listen to this on an archived sermon to understand that there is a Perfection of ministry your Prophet pointed to it he said there'll be a change of ministry it'll not be a first and second poll going back to the outer Court in the inner court but to the revealing of the word itself father we claim it we ask that you will continue to unveil yourself unfold to us the very mysteries of God and when we understand that it's all about you and we're a part of you and we're in Christ how can we be perfect when we're in Christ because God is no longer looking at us but he's looking through the blood of Christ with himself father I thank you I pray that you will bless each and every one as we go our way today bless him in a special way I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen amen let's sing that song Walk With Me Lord walk with
