[4:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. and we serve a good God.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got a couple of praise
[4:49] reports here.
[4:51] This from our sister Maria Arasola.
[4:54] I'd like to give the praise and glory
[4:56] back to God for healing my right
[4:57] shoulder. Last Friday, I woke up with
[5:00] severe pain on my right shoulder. I
[5:02] could only raise my arm at less than a
[5:04] 30° angle from my shoulder. I drove with
[5:08] my left hand only. I could support the
[5:10] steering wheel with the grip of my right
[5:12] hand. And since I was in severe pain
[5:14] when I angled my right arm, I just had
[5:17] to drive with my left hand. Once I
[5:19] started driving, I could not adjust the
[5:20] temperature in the car. I was in so much
[5:23] pain that even wiping the kitchen
[5:25] countertop. I just continued praying for
[5:28] God to take away my shoulder pain so I
[5:30] could use my right hand normally. I just
[5:32] kept praying, believing, and thanking
[5:34] the Lord for his healing power, for he
[5:37] has already done it before the
[5:38] foundation of the world. My daughter
[5:41] asked me if I wanted to have it checked.
[5:42] I said to her, "I do thank the Lord for
[5:45] good doctors and I appreciate these
[5:47] doctors that help their patients, but I
[5:49] was praying, Lord, can you just heal me
[5:53] uh heal me without me going to see the
[5:55] doctor?" The following day, my shoulder
[5:57] felt better, and every day the pain was
[5:59] diminishing until 3 days later, I could
[6:02] do a full range of motion on my right
[6:04] arm and now the pain is completely gone.
[6:06] Praise and glory be to our God and
[6:08] Savior Jesus Christ. God bless you all.
[6:12] Amen. So thankful for the Lord touching
[6:15] her shoulder.
[6:16] Also have a praise report from our
[6:18] sisterh Gracia Castor just saying God is
[6:22] very faithful and has answered my prayer
[6:23] about finding a job. Our sister Gracia
[6:26] also has a prayer request
[6:29] having faith that God will heal my sick
[6:32] coworker. And then from our sister Maria
[6:35] also a prayer request. Please pray for
[6:37] traveling mercies to the Arcasola girls.
[6:40] They will be leaving to the Bethlehe
[6:42] youth camp in South Carolina in a few
[6:44] hours. Definitely pray for traveling
[6:46] mercies for them.
[6:49] And then uh Sister Devel asking prayer
[6:52] for son Isaac asked to pray for the
[6:55] ranch foreman in Texas named Tyler. He
[6:57] is hospitalized with blood clots in his
[7:00] legs. Tyler has already had two
[7:02] surgeries to correct this.
[7:05] Certainly remember Tyler in prayer. And
[7:07] then Sister Mary Hail, please remember
[7:11] Randy Hail in prayer. He's in the
[7:13] hospital with an infection and bone
[7:14] infection. His doctors will be doing
[7:17] surgery on his foot tomorrow to help it.
[7:19] He is streaming from his hospital room
[7:21] tonight. Amen. God is certainly mindful
[7:24] of everything that we have need of.
[7:26] Brother Johnny Green, if if you could
[7:28] just come take these needs to the Lord.
[7:31] While he's coming, we also do just want
[7:33] to make a quick announcement. Family

[8:13] dear God, that you would be with each
[8:14] one. There are serious needs, especially
[8:17] Brother Randy in the hospital tonight.
[8:19] Lord, he really needs a touch, dear God.
[8:22] I pray that Lord you be mindful of each
[8:24] and every one of these that are spoken
[8:26] and those needs that are in the
[8:27] congregation amongst the people tonight.
[8:30] May your Holy Spirit bring Father faith
[8:33] to each and every single one of them.

[8:38] all you continue to do for us. Lord,

[8:51] journey. Father, may you continue to use
[8:53] and bless them. And we thank you for
[8:56] this opportunity to give you praise once
[8:58] more in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[9:08] thee.

[9:57] And I'll be satisfied as long
[10:04] as I walk. Let me walk close to thee.

[13:05] sling.

[15:55] day

[16:10] their foreheads.

[28:28] need within them,
[28:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, may they reach out and touch the
[28:32] gar.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; We just commit this service into your
[28:38] hands.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you
[28:43] &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; And amen.
[28:49] You love the Lord this evening.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; He's so good to us.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, musicians.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; It's certainly good to be home. If you
[29:01] have your Bibles, you can turn to First
[29:03] John 4.
[29:06] We thank you for your prayers. We are up
[29:07] there with Brother Lindsay. Um we had
[29:11] such a special time. I bring you
[29:12] greetings from brother Lindsay in the
[29:14] church there and
[29:16] a special greetings to his favorite son,
[29:18] brother Ben.
[29:21] I think every son that moves away
[29:23] becomes the favorite son.
[29:27] And uh yeah, we had a wonderful time
[29:29] this weekend. It was just a a short trip
[29:32] up the mountains and it was beautiful to
[29:35] see the fall and changing of the leaves.
[29:37] For you Phoenicians that don't know what
[29:39] that is, it's where the leaves begin to
[29:40] change color and
[29:43] we don't have that much here, but it is
[29:45] beautiful to see. And it is
[29:47] &gt;&gt; um my wife was able to go up there with
[29:51] me and actually my parents went up there
[29:53] with me um for the service. They had
[29:55] like a four o'clock service on Sunday
[29:58] and we just had a wonderful time. Um, I
[30:02] do want to wish my wife a happy
[30:04] birthday, a late birthday.
[30:07] Um,
[30:09] the Lord's good and he has blessed me
[30:11] with a wonderful wife and certainly
[30:14] honored and we just trust the Lord give
[30:16] her a wonderful year.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to First John 4
[30:24] in verse 7.
[30:28] And it says, "Beloved,
[30:31] let us love one another,
[30:33] for love is of God, and everyone that
[30:36] loveth is born of God and knoweth God,
[30:39] and he that loveth not knoweth not God,
[30:42] for God is love."
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; In this was manifested the love of God
[30:47] toward us, because that he has sent his
[30:49] only begotten son into the world,
[30:52] that we might live through him.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Wherein is love, not
[30:57] that we loved God, but that he loved us
[31:00] &gt;&gt; and sent his son to be the propitiation
[31:04] for our sins. Beloved,
[31:07] if God so loved us, we ought to love
[31:10] also love one another.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; No man hath seen God at any time. If we
[31:17] love one another, God dwelleth in us,
[31:20] and his love is perfected in us. Turn
[31:24] over to second Peter 1.
[31:34] Second Peter 1 and verse two.
[31:40] Very familiar scripture of the stature
[31:42] of a perfect man.
[31:45] And verse two says, "Grace and peace be
[31:48] multiplied unto you through the
[31:49] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
[31:52] according to as his divine power hath
[31:55] given unto us all things that pertain
[31:57] unto life and godliness, through the
[32:00] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[32:04] glory and virtue,
[32:06] whereby are given unto us exceeding and
[32:08] great great and precious promises, that
[32:11] by these ye might be partakers of the
[32:15] divine divine nature.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; How many want to be partakers of the
[32:18] divine nature?
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Having escaped the corruption that is in
[32:23] the world through the lust.
[32:26] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[32:28] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[32:31] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[32:34] and to temperance patience, and to
[32:36] patience godliness,
[32:38] and to godliness brotherly kindness,
[32:41] and brotherly kindness charity.
[32:45] For these things be in you and abound.
[32:49] They make you that you should ne neither
[32:51] be barren nor unfruitful in the
[32:53] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But
[32:56] he that lackth these things is blind and
[32:59] cannot see a far off and hath forgotten
[33:01] that he was purged from his old sins.
[33:06] Wherefore the rather brethren give
[33:08] diligence to make your calling and
[33:11] election sure.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. For if you do these things, ye
[33:15] shall never fall.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; How many wants that assurance this
[33:19] evening that you will never fall?
[33:22] &gt;&gt; You can be seated this evening.
[33:27] I certainly want that security.
[33:30] And it says here that
[33:33] these things you do and abound
[33:36] to make your calling and election sure.
[33:39] That if you do these things, you shall
[33:41] never fall. And I just don't want to be
[33:44] an unfruitful Christian.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be 30fold or 60fold, but
[33:49] I want to be a hundfold Christian and I
[33:53] want these things and and I want uh to
[33:55] be a partaker of the divine nature of
[33:58] God. And the last time we spoke there on
[34:02] the inward law of God and I kind of want
[34:04] to go in that direction
[34:07] that we took from Romans 7. And Paul
[34:09] says that when I try to do good, evil is
[34:11] present with me that there's a war
[34:14] happening between my members and and a
[34:18] war happening within my mind. And he
[34:21] says that I find pleasure and I delight
[34:23] after the law after the inward man which
[34:26] is the law of God. And to use two quotes
[34:30] just to bring us up to speed in the
[34:32] restoration of the bride tree. He says
[34:33] God has set all his laws to serve him
[34:36] both natural and spiritual working
[34:38] according to his word regardless of the
[34:42] condition. He says I have a scripture on
[34:44] that. Yes. God sets all his laws into
[34:47] motion. God set all his laws into motion
[34:50] that it must work according to his own
[34:52] word. His word. His laws has to work
[34:55] according to his word.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He commanded the sun. He commanded
[35:00] the moon. He commanded the earth. He
[35:02] commanded nature. And they fell all
[35:05] right in line.
[35:08] And all these laws work in harmony with
[35:11] God's spoken word. So we know that
[35:14] whenever he spoke in the beginning, he
[35:16] put these things in order. That he would
[35:18] set the moon in place and he would set
[35:20] the stars up there and that he would put
[35:22] laws within them that from that time he
[35:24] wouldn't have to change those laws. that
[35:26] they were set there forever. And those
[35:28] laws were put in place and they work in
[35:31] harmony according to his spoken word.
[35:34] And the laws of life that's in us will
[35:37] bring us to a resurrection. It's got to.
[35:40] It's impossible for it not to. Why is it
[35:43] impossible? Because if you are a part of
[35:45] his word, then you yourself are going to
[35:48] work in harmony to God's word.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; There is a harmony that comes with
[35:52] living a Christian life. that whenever
[35:55] it's not just coming to church and
[35:57] reading your Bible and doing trying to
[35:59] be a good Christian, but there is a
[36:00] harmony that that should pro protrude
[36:03] within your life. That there should be
[36:04] harmony between your family. There
[36:06] should be a harmony between you and your
[36:08] marriage. And there should be a harmony
[36:10] in the way that you live a good
[36:12] Christian life.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; These laws have to work in harmony. How
[36:23] much more should our daily lives work in
[36:26] harmony to God's word?
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; In the fundamental foundation for faith,
[36:31] he says, "And if Satan by his power can
[36:34] make his laws work in man, how much more
[36:36] ought God with his power make his laws
[36:38] work in man?"
[36:40] &gt;&gt; If Satan can make his laws be sure in us
[36:42] recognize it, how much more ought God
[36:45] through his children?
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is going to use his
[36:48] children
[36:50] &gt;&gt; to make his laws known
[36:52] &gt;&gt; that you can see that he put his laws up
[36:54] in the stars and he he created the
[36:57] universe and he put laws within those
[36:59] things. But those things don't have a
[37:00] soul. You and I have a soul. And our law
[37:03] the these laws that God wants to express
[37:06] through you and I in this portion he
[37:08] wants to express through his children.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. and to make his laws be recognized
[37:14] amongst his people of divine healing and
[37:16] revelation and power and gifts and
[37:19] manifestations of the spirit. So you see
[37:21] that these laws were put in place and
[37:23] brother Brandham would tell us many
[37:25] times that you can read in your Bible
[37:26] and you can see that the moon is the he
[37:29] would type it to the bride and how the
[37:30] sun is the type of Christ and you can
[37:33] see all these types and shadows
[37:36] &gt;&gt; but yet there's laws that within us that
[37:39] the moon can't express.
[37:43] There's laws within us that he has to
[37:46] express through you and I.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; That the stars can't express healing.
[37:50] The moon can't express the love of God.
[37:53] The the all the these things of the
[37:55] universe, they they they can't express
[37:57] these attributes that God wants to
[38:00] express. So, he has to use his children.
[38:12] You and I as human vessels
[38:15] will be used to express these laws of
[38:17] joy and peace and revelation and
[38:21] understanding. But yet, God's going to
[38:23] send us through trials and things to
[38:25] begin to express those attributes.
[38:32] without you going through a sickness.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that the earth is
[38:42] groaning for the manifestation
[38:45] of the sons and daughters of God.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; So this e evening if I can talk
[38:52] on the mysterious law of love
[38:56] for for a subject of I will heal your
[38:58] backslidings.
[39:00] I will heal your backslidings. And it
[39:03] was just something that in study it just
[39:06] ended up in this direction. And I hope
[39:08] that I can tie it together.
[39:12] And Webster says the mysterious means to
[39:15] relating to or tooting a mystery. And he
[39:19] put this here, the mysterious ways of
[39:22] God. That according to everybody else,
[39:24] there's a God is a mystery. That there's
[39:27] things that he doesn't show to
[39:28] everybody. that there's ways that God
[39:31] does things and there's a mystery to it.
[39:36] Mystery is an exciting wonder or
[39:38] curiosity or
[39:40] surprise while baffling efforts to
[39:43] comprehend or identify. Mysterious means
[39:46] something is strange or unknown, not
[39:49] easily understood or explained, which
[39:52] can cause a curiosity, a wonder or an
[39:55] awe. So putting this together of having
[39:58] a mysterious law of love that sometimes
[40:01] we can't explain the law the love of
[40:03] God.
[40:05] Sometimes we can't explain the way that
[40:07] the reason or how why we love the things
[40:11] that we do. Just as human beings within
[40:14] this building we all love different
[40:16] things.
[40:18] We all are attracted to a different
[40:19] person. That I married my wife because I
[40:22] I fell in love with her. that there was
[40:26] attributes within her and things that I
[40:28] loved about her,
[40:31] &gt;&gt; but I wouldn't love another woman.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; And each one of us has a choice that we
[40:37] can fall in love.
[40:39] And I trust that you marry the right
[40:42] person over love.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Not over money,
[40:48] &gt;&gt; not because he smells good, not because
[40:50] his feet are small.
[40:55] But because of love,
[40:59] &gt;&gt; love can be a mystery.
[41:02] When you fall in love with somebody,
[41:03] some people might ask, "Now, what does
[41:06] she find in him?"
[41:11] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. You don't
[41:14] understand it, but they're in love.
[41:19] You might not put a couple together, but
[41:22] they fell in love.
[41:27] Why do we love the way that we do?
[41:31] Why don't we all love the same things?
[41:44] the mysterious side of love that you
[41:47] can't explain it. It's hard to
[41:48] comprehend.
[41:51] You sit and wonder.
[41:55] And I, for myself, it's no different
[41:57] with Christ than I.
[42:01] Sometimes I wonder that out of 8.2
[42:04] billion people on planet Earth, why did
[42:06] God choose me to love?
[42:09] Amen.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Out of all my faults and all my failures
[42:12] and all my mistakes and the things that
[42:14] I do, why did God love me?
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Why does he love you?
[42:31] You see the love that God has for his
[42:33] bride or his church.
[42:38] He just doesn't love everybody.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; He's not attracted to everybody.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; He's not attracted to every church. He
[42:46] doesn't go to I if if it was based on
[42:49] upon the beauty of a church.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; The Catholics would have us beat.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; If it was about a big denominational
[42:58] church, we would definitely be beat.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Because God doesn't love everybody. But
[43:04] God loves people that love him and love
[43:07] him according to his word.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[43:21] He's calling a people from every
[43:22] kindred, tongue, and nation. So it's not
[43:25] based upon the church,
[43:29] but he falls in love with an individual.
[43:33] He falls in love with you as a
[43:35] individual.
[43:39] that the more I travel and you can go to
[43:42] different places that it's it doesn't
[43:44] matter the amount of people
[43:46] &gt;&gt; that God is still the same and he comes
[43:48] in a such a sweet and sovereign way
[43:50] whether you have five people whether you
[43:52] have 25 people whether you have 200
[43:55] people or a thousand people
[43:59] &gt;&gt; God comes to the people he loves
[44:03] &gt;&gt; and he has fellowship
[44:05] &gt;&gt; and from the very beginning of time God
[44:08] always wanted fellowship.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but it's a
[44:21] mystery to me why God chose to love me.
[44:28] Sometimes I don't understand it. I can't
[44:30] explain it. But one thing I do know, I'm
[44:33] glad that he does.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And I know one thing
[44:38] that I love him and he loves me
[44:40] &gt;&gt; and that's all that really matters
[44:43] &gt;&gt; is that whenever you fall in love one
[44:45] time that he will supply every need that
[44:47] you have, every desire that you have,
[44:50] every question that there is. God will
[44:52] supply every single one of those.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; John 3:16 says, "God so loved the world
[45:03] that he gave his only begotten son."
[45:05] What did that love cost him? It cost him
[45:08] a sacrifice.
[45:11] That this love came at a sacrifice. And
[45:14] Ephesians 5 and 25 says, "Husbands, love
[45:17] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[45:19] church and gave himself for it." See,
[45:22] he's requiring you husbands to have the
[45:24] same kind of love. A love that comes at
[45:27] a sacrifice.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Not a selfish love,
[45:32] &gt;&gt; but a love that comes at a sacrifice.
[45:35] Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; And the sad part of it is is many of us
[45:38] are s doing uh
[45:42] have s are sacrificing over a lot less
[45:49] that we're willing to sacrifice
[45:53] our marriages. We sacrifice our children
[45:57] over the love of money, over the desires
[45:59] of a career. and you go out and you do
[46:01] these things and we must do those to
[46:03] live,
[46:06] but you sacrifice and you give up.
[46:10] Why? Because of a love for something.
[46:15] The love of entertainment and sports.
[46:20] You can't expect your kids to fall in
[46:22] love with Christ if you're not in love
[46:24] yourself.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:31] You see, if you don't sacrifice
[46:33] for the right things,
[46:36] you will begin to lose things.
[46:39] But it's also true, if you sacrifice for
[46:41] the right things, God will bless you.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; If you want to be blessed in your
[46:48] marriage,
[46:49] sacrifice some time. Go spend it with
[46:52] your wife.
[46:54] Show her how much you appreciate her.
[46:58] Show her how much you love her.
[47:02] Sacrifice some time and spend it with
[47:04] the boys. Spend it with your children.
[47:11] Why? Because it's a law of God.
[47:15] He says in divine love, he says there's
[47:17] two kinds of love. There is a love which
[47:22] which is called human love or in the
[47:24] Greek word is called filio love. And in
[47:27] the divine love is agapo love. Agapo
[47:29] love is divine love. And when divine
[47:33] love is in your heart, there's a
[47:34] difference in your life. And everybody
[47:38] knows it. That's right. You live like a
[47:41] Christian. You act like a Christian. You
[47:43] walk like a Christian. Your whole system
[47:46] is timed to God's Bible.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Your whole system is timed to God's
[47:52] Bible. Why? Because you're in harmony
[47:54] with God's word. And when you're in
[47:56] harmony with God's word, that is the way
[47:58] and the beauty of it. That your whole
[48:00] system, your world and everything that
[48:02] you do is timed according to God's
[48:05] Bible.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Because all these laws have to work
[48:11] in harmony to God's word.
[48:14] Hear him. He says, "Men and women, hear
[48:16] me today as your brother. Let all your
[48:19] isms and your little sensations drop.
[48:21] Find the love of God. I'd rather have
[48:24] his love than every gift he's got in the
[48:26] kingdom to give me love.
[48:30] Give me his love. And that's what the
[48:32] world is looking for today is to see a
[48:34] display of real love. It'll win souls
[48:37] when you got love.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; They can tell when you've got it. Got
[48:41] love. He says, "We've got too much
[48:44] makebelieve love."
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; We got too much love of filio love.
[48:49] Trying to make it agapo love. Let me
[48:51] tell you, you can't make filio love of
[48:53] agapo love.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; We need real godly love.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan can impersonate a lot of
[49:03] things. He can impersonate a lot of
[49:05] loves and he can do a lot of things, but
[49:07] there's one thing he can't do is that is
[49:09] an impersonate and agile love. The real
[49:12] genuine love of God.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not in him.
[49:21] And we can take the laws of God and go
[49:23] in so many different directions. And
[49:29] I want to focus here as we read on the
[49:32] stature of a perfect man in the divine
[49:34] nature. And when you come to the
[49:36] seventh, it is brotherly kindness. And
[49:39] we know that the capstone is love.
[49:42] There is a myri mysterious side of love
[49:45] that you can't explain.
[49:48] Yet the more that I read the scripture
[49:50] and and I begin to just go through the
[49:53] New Testament and I and I didn't search
[49:55] them out and so I probably missed them.
[49:57] But you begin to just pick up your Bible
[49:59] and and most of them I highlighted them
[50:02] already and you begin to talk about and
[50:04] you begin to read the love of God and
[50:06] the love your neighbor as thyself
[50:10] &gt;&gt; and how important it is to have
[50:12] brotherly love.
[50:19] And yet the more that I read, it's not
[50:21] just a suggestion that you must have
[50:26] &gt;&gt; but it is an absolute must.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; To have brotherly love.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; And the closer you get to perfection,
[50:35] the more love that we ought to be
[50:38] portraying in our Christian walk.
[50:42] that God loves in such a way that in
[50:45] turn we should also love our brothers
[50:48] &gt;&gt; and love our neighbors as thyself.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says in divine love
[50:56] and sovereign grace. This is 1956.
[51:00] He says, "Now we face in the day that
[51:02] when it is prophesied to us that
[51:05] brotherly love would become a strange
[51:07] thing among people."
[51:09] 19 and 56.
[51:12] What is that? 70 years. 60 years. 70.
[51:17] Where would be brotherly love be now?
[51:25] A strange thing among people. And it is
[51:28] to my humble belief. He says, humble
[51:30] belief. Now, we're entitled to our own
[51:32] humble beliefs and our own humble
[51:34] opinions. But let me tell you, I'm going
[51:36] to take the prophet's humble belief.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[51:40] He says
[51:42] that it's the greatest of all the gifts
[51:44] that there is in God's Bible. If the
[51:48] Lord Jesus should stand on the platform
[51:50] tonight and look at me in the face and
[51:52] say, "I'm going to give you your choice.
[51:54] You can be a great person, a great
[51:55] minister, and I'll give you a gift of
[51:57] preaching the gospel, and I'll give you
[51:59] the gift of teaching the word, and I'll
[52:00] give you the gift of divine healing.
[52:02] I'll give you the gift of prophecy, and
[52:04] I'll I'll make you a prophet." And any
[52:06] of these fine gifts of faith, any of
[52:09] these gifts that's in the Bible, I'll
[52:11] give them every one to you. And then I
[52:14] will withhold love from you. Or either
[52:17] I'll give you love and withhold all the
[52:19] gifts from you. I'd say, Lord, take all
[52:22] the gifts and let me have love.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; For no matter how many gifts we've got,
[52:27] they've ne never will do any do us any
[52:31] good except the love of God is in the
[52:33] motion behind the gift. We must have
[52:36] love.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; You see, gifts don't save anybody.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Healing doesn't save anybody. That if
[52:44] the prophet himself can come and hold
[52:46] meetings and have revivals and and heal
[52:49] thousands of people and people come
[52:51] through a prayer line, nobody just got
[52:52] saved from that.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; It didn't hold everybody.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; But yet, there's a power behind love.
[53:02] Yeah.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; And there's such an importance of love
[53:05] in our lives
[53:09] that we can preach all the sermons and
[53:11] we can do all the things and you say,
[53:13] "Well, I don't preach." Well, that well,
[53:15] you live a good Christian life and you
[53:17] try to live godly, but if you have not
[53:19] love
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Matthew 22 and 36 says, "Master,
[53:30] which is the greatest commandment in the
[53:32] law?" And Jesus said unto him, "Thou
[53:34] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[53:36] heart, and with all thy soul, and with
[53:38] all thy mind."
[53:40] This is the first and great commandment.
[53:43] And the second is like unto it. Thou
[53:45] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. And
[53:49] these two commandments hang all the law.
[54:12] that you also love one another.
[54:15] By this shall all men know that ye are
[54:17] my disciples. By what? By the love that
[54:20] you have one for another.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; That you are my disciples.
[54:28] If you
[54:37] live and how you know coming and being a
[54:39] friend of the pastor and doing all the
[54:41] things that you can though those are
[54:43] good. It's not just on quoting
[54:46] scripture.
[54:50] It's not just on quoting quotes though
[54:52] that's good. But let me tell you, Satan
[54:55] knows scripture
[54:57] &gt;&gt; and Satan knows quotes and Satan comes
[54:59] to church.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that he can't do
[55:03] and have this kind of love.
[55:14] So based upon this portion of scripture
[55:16] we read disciplehip
[55:20] disciplehip for God is based on your
[55:24] love for your brother.
[55:31] And one more scripture here,
[55:34] James 2 and8.
[55:39] And it says, "If you fulfill the royal
[55:41] law according to the scripture, thou
[55:43] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye
[55:45] do well. But if you have respects a
[55:48] person and you commit sin or convict
[55:51] convinced of the law as a transgressor,
[55:54] for whosoever shall keep the whole law
[55:56] yet offend in one point, he is guilty of
[56:00] all.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; And as I begin to look into this portion
[56:05] of scripture, why is it called the royal
[56:08] law of God? Why is it the royal law?
[56:11] Because royal has something to do with
[56:13] it.
[56:17] It's only used one time in the
[56:19] scripture,
[56:20] the royal law. And when you begin to use
[56:23] the word loyal, royal in the Bible, it
[56:26] is used to describe
[56:28] things that belong to a king or a kingly
[56:30] power.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. It is something that
[56:34] belongs to a king or a kingly power. So
[56:38] when the Bible says it is the royal law,
[56:41] who is it pertaining to?
[56:46] that not everybody can love
[56:49] &gt;&gt; and have this kind of love.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Because in order to be royal, it m you
[56:55] must come from a lineage. You must come
[56:57] from a bloodline.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; You must be a part of something. You can
[57:01] either be married into it or born into
[57:03] it.
[57:05] But not everybody is a part of royalty.
[57:12] that royal has king characteristics. It
[57:15] comes with a supreme authority
[57:18] that in order to fulfill the royal law
[57:20] you must be a part of the royal family.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Not anyone can fulfill this scripture
[57:27] because it comes with the divine nature.
[57:30] And without Christ, there's no way for
[57:32] you and I to have this kind of love.
[57:35] You cannot have this kind of love one
[57:38] for another without Christ.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; You can have love for other people but
[57:52] as the scripture says here but to love
[57:54] them as yourself.
[57:58] Love somebody else as yourself.
[58:02] How many loves their neighbor
[58:05] naturally?
[58:07] It's impossible. It's hard to understand
[58:11] that you can have a love for somebody
[58:13] else that you don't even know or it's a
[58:14] neighbor or a brother or somebody in the
[58:16] church,
[58:18] but you have an affinity with them. You
[58:20] have a love for them.
[58:28] It's against all human reasoning and
[58:30] ability.
[58:32] But let me say this evening, since you
[58:33] are a part of God and the royal seed of
[58:36] Abraham, you are able to have this kind
[58:38] of love.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; And not only have this kind of love that
[58:42] it may abound in your life, but it is
[58:44] required of you.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:49] You have this ability within you to
[58:51] express this kind of love.
[58:55] Brother Brandham says in questions and
[58:57] answers, he says, "Always remember,
[58:59] you're God's children. You're from a
[59:01] royal family. You're a royal blood.
[59:04] There's no better blood in the world
[59:06] than yours." That's right. A royal blood
[59:09] shows itself.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's royal. Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Again, in the the greatest battle ever
[59:16] fought, he says, "And the royal seed of
[59:19] Jesus or of Christ is a Holy Ghost
[59:21] filled church
[59:23] &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost." What? The
[59:25] royal seed. By promise, not by
[59:27] sensation, but by the promise of God.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; They stand by the word of God and they
[59:33] chop their way through screaming,
[59:34] "Hallelujah."
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody say hallelujah this evening.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; That you chop your way. that no matter
[59:41] what you're going through, you stand
[59:42] upon the basis of his word and you keep
[59:44] chopping. No matter trial that comes up,
[59:47] you just keep chopping. Whatever
[59:49] sickness that has come upon you, you
[59:50] just keep chopping
[59:52] &gt;&gt; stand upon the basis of his word.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Because it's not of our own ability.
[59:59] It's not of our own choosing. You didn't
[1:00:00] choose this royal.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; You didn't choose to be a part of the
[1:00:05] royal family. But it is by
[1:00:07] predestination that God for ordained
[1:00:10] predestinated you to be a part of his
[1:00:12] family.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; That it's nothing within ourselves, not
[1:00:17] of our own desires. If we had our own
[1:00:19] desires, we'd be doing something else
[1:00:20] tonight.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; If we were living according to the
[1:00:24] flesh, some of us would be too tired or
[1:00:26] we'd have money to make or we'd have
[1:00:28] things to do. But that's not who we are.
[1:00:30] There's something that is running
[1:00:32] through our veins that we have a desire
[1:00:34] to come to the house of God and say,
[1:00:36] "God, I am here. I am a part of your
[1:00:38] family and I'm going to sit around your
[1:00:40] dinner table this evening
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; that you would come and you would speak
[1:00:45] to my life
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; that you would help me to have this kind
[1:00:49] of love.
[1:01:01] We can remember that there's only two
[1:01:03] bloodlines
[1:01:07] from the beginning
[1:01:09] that started in creation there. And I
[1:01:12] can take us back to Genesis 4.
[1:01:15] And you can see the
[1:01:18] two that would come together. And in
[1:01:20] Genesis 4 is where the first fruits of
[1:01:23] the the the fall would come. You would
[1:01:27] have Cain and you would have Abel.
[1:01:30] And you would see the very sin that it
[1:01:32] caused there in Genesis.
[1:01:35] That what was the first death?
[1:01:41] What was the first killing?
[1:01:44] It was of a brother. One to another.
[1:01:48] Those are the fruits
[1:01:51] of the fallen seed.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; So I wonder,
[1:01:57] and it's not a place to give our own
[1:01:59] opinion, but my humble opinion,
[1:02:02] why that God put such a great emphasis.
[1:02:06] Whenever you read your New Testament on
[1:02:09] having brotherly love, because if that
[1:02:12] produced a killing, how much is God
[1:02:14] going to have to require of his first
[1:02:16] fruits? What are the attributes that are
[1:02:19] going to be birthed through this first
[1:02:21] through his lineage through his
[1:02:22] bloodline?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; That if one is willing to slay his
[1:02:26] brother over jealousy and all of that,
[1:02:28] how much more is God
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; going to require of us brotherly love?
[1:02:39] Because when we read in the New
[1:02:41] Testament
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; that your love for your brother
[1:02:47] identifies
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; what seed you come from.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Your love for your brother identifies
[1:02:58] what bloodline you're from.
[1:03:06] As I said, because Satan can impersonate
[1:03:08] a lot of things,
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; but he can't impersonate the agile love
[1:03:13] of God.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have that law within him.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Remember the royal law.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; How do you be be are you able to love
[1:03:26] your neighbor as yourself and portray
[1:03:28] that love one for another?
[1:03:31] Satan doesn't have that law within him.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; And we can see it all down through
[1:03:38] scripture.
[1:03:40] The conflict of brothers, both natural
[1:03:42] and in the flesh.
[1:03:45] You can take Cain and Abel or Jacob and
[1:03:47] Esau.
[1:03:49] The battle of two brothers,
[1:03:52] Judas and Jesus. He said, "You're your
[1:03:54] father, the devil.
[1:04:00] And the Bible gives us a story of
[1:04:03] Joseph and his brothers
[1:04:07] and how that it gives us an example of
[1:04:10] how we should have brotherly love one
[1:04:12] for another
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; because we we know that Joseph was sent
[1:04:19] and he would have dreams and he would
[1:04:22] become spiritual and he would begin to
[1:04:24] tell his dreams and share with his
[1:04:26] brothers and and his brothers would hate
[1:04:28] him for it and with the they would sell
[1:04:30] him off into slavery and they would
[1:04:32] throw him in a ditch and tell him his
[1:04:34] father that he was dead
[1:04:37] and he would go off into slavery and it
[1:04:39] was brother Brandham says it's a perfect
[1:04:41] type of Christ
[1:04:45] how that his brothers would portray him
[1:04:47] or uh betray him
[1:04:54] that I can imagine Humanly,
[1:05:00] Joseph was hurt.
[1:05:03] He was bitter.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; He was broken.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; He was betrayed. He was left alone.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Sold into slavery, not knowing what
[1:05:14] would lay ahead.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; All because of his brothers.
[1:05:22] But yet within this story, there would
[1:05:23] come a time
[1:05:26] that Joseph would have to
[1:05:29] in the time of judgment
[1:05:32] that his brothers would come to him and
[1:05:34] bow down before him and they would
[1:05:36] fulfill the dreams that he had.
[1:05:40] And there was coming a time that as they
[1:05:42] laid stood bowed down before him, he
[1:05:44] stood. He had a choice within the power
[1:05:47] that he had to choose grace or judgment.
[1:05:50] Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; He had a choice to look him in the eye
[1:05:57] and either choose grace or love
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; or love or judgment.
[1:06:06] And when you put yourself in his shoes,
[1:06:10] it's easy to say.
[1:06:15] But can you imagine after all those
[1:06:17] years and all those beatings and all
[1:06:20] those nights left alone, not knowing why
[1:06:24] this purpose was to be fulfilled?
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Do you think Joseph was hurting his
[1:06:31] spirit?
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; That he looked his brother in the eye.
[1:06:35] How could you do that?
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; How could you treat me? I'm apart.
[1:06:41] We're brothers.
[1:06:45] But yet there came a time that Joseph
[1:06:54] when he looked at his brothers,
[1:06:58] he set aside all the hurt, all the pain,
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; and he said, "They're my brothers."
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Their blood is the same as my blood.
[1:07:09] Yeah.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Their father is the same as my father.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; What grace he must have had.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; To be able to put all that aside.
[1:07:29] I'm going somewhere because I want you
[1:07:31] to understand that maybe there are some
[1:07:34] sitting in this congregation that have
[1:07:36] been hurt, that have been bruised, that
[1:07:38] have been uh back bitten, that been all
[1:07:41] these things by their brother,
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; but there's going to come a time.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; What kind of love are you going to
[1:07:49] portray?
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; What kind of grace are you going to
[1:07:53] show?
[1:07:58] It's a mysterious part of love.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we go through a trial.
[1:08:18] Maybe some will go down. It'll be down
[1:08:21] the road. And you have to remember that
[1:08:24] when a brother maybe hurts you, he
[1:08:27] offends you, he does something to you,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; you all have to remember what law of
[1:08:35] love are you going to show.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; You see, because this expression of
[1:08:46] love, it can be uncomfortable
[1:08:49] showing grace. Sometimes when they don't
[1:08:52] deserve it is a hard thing.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Showing love when somebody's really
[1:08:59] offended you is it's a tough thing to be
[1:09:03] the bigger person and go up to somebody
[1:09:05] and say, "I'm sorry." It's a hard thing.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Or am I the only one?
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; We're all humans.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; We all know what I'm talking about.
[1:09:25] We also know the story of the prodal
[1:09:31] that the love that was shown
[1:09:35] that many times when a prodal
[1:09:39] comes home the father he celebrates here
[1:09:43] and he kills the fatted calf and he
[1:09:45] gives him the code and he he he gives
[1:09:47] him the ring and he does all this, but
[1:09:49] yet there's one that's sitting who's
[1:09:52] hurt, who's bittered,
[1:09:55] why
[1:09:58] why does the older brother, wouldn't you
[1:10:00] think that if we see somebody, they go
[1:10:02] out and they they they waste all that
[1:10:04] they had,
[1:10:08] all of their inheritance, they gave it
[1:10:10] away
[1:10:12] and then they come back to church
[1:10:15] and some sit as the older other
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; bitter hard
[1:10:22] why
[1:10:25] with the father when the son comes home.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; But you see there's things in our flesh
[1:10:35] that we don't understand
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; that how could God do something like
[1:10:41] that? Maybe he sends a mother away and
[1:10:43] she begins to backslide. And maybe it's
[1:10:45] a father or maybe it's a son or somebody
[1:10:47] that you love dearly. The thing about a
[1:10:49] prodal when they go out in the world,
[1:10:51] what happens? It is somebody that is so
[1:10:53] dear to you or close to you or been to
[1:10:55] our church and amongst our ranks. It's
[1:10:57] somebody personal, somebody that you've
[1:10:59] shared memories with and treasured times
[1:11:01] with and done all these things
[1:11:04] and they go out
[1:11:07] and then they come back.
[1:11:10] And yet we are the ones
[1:11:12] that are left bitter,
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; broken,
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; bruised.
[1:11:18] Well, how can they go out and do all
[1:11:20] these things and live the way they want
[1:11:22] and they can enjoy life and do all those
[1:11:23] and then I'm here faithful and I I never
[1:11:26] left you, Lord.
[1:11:38] and they come back.
[1:11:47] And it's hard for some to show love,
[1:11:51] to show grace.
[1:11:59] It's a love that we can't understand
[1:12:01] sometimes.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; The love of a father.
[1:12:06] Why does God do the things that he does?
[1:12:09] Yes,
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Why does he send us through the trials
[1:12:11] that we go through?
[1:12:20] You see the
[1:12:22] wounds of a backslider,
[1:12:25] yet they're guilty.
[1:12:30] But they come back and they come amongst
[1:12:33] our ranks and it's hard.
[1:12:36] But yet maybe God is going to use your
[1:12:38] love to bring their healing.
[1:12:51] It's going to test your real brotherly
[1:12:53] love
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; because this kind of love is not when
[1:12:59] it's deserved.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; It's not when it's easy. You can love
[1:13:07] somebody whenever they're a friend to
[1:13:08] you or you know your your your friends
[1:13:11] and it's easy to have that kind of love
[1:13:13] to say I'm a Christian and I love this
[1:13:15] brother and I love brother Jim. You know
[1:13:17] you have all these Yeah. We have a love
[1:13:20] one for another but what happens when
[1:13:22] that person hurts you?
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; What happens when that person says
[1:13:26] something against you
[1:13:29] and you begin to avoid them throughout
[1:13:31] the church? Then if they're coming your
[1:13:33] way, you go the other.
[1:13:38] It's time to face it, saints,
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; to love the unlovable.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Yet, if you begin to look at this, it's
[1:13:54] no different than Christ and you and I.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; That how could love God love us? That
[1:14:00] while we were yet sinners, he died for
[1:14:02] us. that he did all these things for you
[1:14:05] and I, but yet we didn't always love
[1:14:06] him. That we are out there doing our own
[1:14:08] thing in a backslid condition, living
[1:14:11] any kind of life. Yet he's seen a seed.
[1:14:13] He knew that you were a part of him and
[1:14:15] he knew that you would come unto him,
[1:14:17] but he didn't wait for you. That's
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; But he went on with a plan of
[1:14:24] redemption, knowing that in your time
[1:14:27] and whenever he had an appointment with
[1:14:29] you, God always meets his appointment.
[1:14:33] that you would recognize his love
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; And if you have your Bibles, I want to
[1:14:49] go to Jeremiah 3.
[1:14:53] I'm gonna have to hurry here
[1:14:57] because Israel, we know, is God's people
[1:14:59] and he delivers them time and time
[1:15:01] again. and he would he he they fall in
[1:15:03] love with him. They serve him. Then they
[1:15:04] go into a a condition that God doesn't
[1:15:07] want to be associated with. And then he
[1:15:09] delivers them again and he he does all
[1:15:11] these things and he delivers them from
[1:15:13] the hand of Pharaoh and they fall in
[1:15:14] love and they worship him. But then as
[1:15:16] time goes on, they begin to have other
[1:15:18] gods and other things that they begin to
[1:15:20] worship, other idols that they put in
[1:15:22] the place of God.
[1:15:27] And here in this chapter he says there
[1:15:31] in verse one he says they say if a man
[1:15:33] put away his wife and she should go from
[1:15:35] him and become another man shall she
[1:15:37] return again and shall not that land be
[1:15:41] greatly polluted but thou hast played
[1:15:43] the harlot with many lovers yet you
[1:15:45] return unto me saith the Lord. He says,
[1:15:49] "Wherefore the showers have been
[1:15:51] withholden, and there have been no
[1:15:53] latter rain, and thou hast a
[1:15:55] forehead, and thou refuses to be
[1:15:58] ashamed." Listen to the condition that
[1:16:00] Israel got themselves in that they began
[1:16:02] to not receive the blessings of the of
[1:16:04] the Lord. And they were living in a dry
[1:16:06] and desert place. They're living under a
[1:16:10] condition that they weren't even ashamed
[1:16:11] of the way that they were living.
[1:16:18] knowing the truth but yet not doing and
[1:16:21] falling in love with Christ.
[1:16:24] And it's by their own choice.
[1:16:27] Listen, it's by your own choice
[1:16:29] sometimes that you begin to get
[1:16:30] backsliden
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; that you make choices that you know when
[1:16:34] we talk about the backslider, you can
[1:16:36] think about ones that have left the
[1:16:37] message, but what about ones that are
[1:16:39] sitting here tonight or just listening
[1:16:41] on the internet that aren't living
[1:16:43] according to God's word? Because if
[1:16:45] you're not moving forward, you're living
[1:16:47] in a backstate condition.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto me in the days of
[1:16:57] Josiah the king, "Hast thou seen that
[1:17:00] which backsliding Israel hath done? She
[1:17:03] has gone up unto every high mountain,
[1:17:05] and unto every tree, and there hath
[1:17:06] played the harlot, and I had said after
[1:17:08] her, she had done all these things. Turn
[1:17:11] thou unto me," but she turned not. and
[1:17:14] her treacherous sister Judah saw it. And
[1:17:17] I saw when all the law for all the
[1:17:19] causes which whereby backsliding Israel
[1:17:22] committed adultery, and I put her away,
[1:17:25] and giving her a bill of divorce, yet
[1:17:27] her treacherous sister Judah feared not,
[1:17:29] and went and played the harlot also. So
[1:17:32] we see this bill of divorce, it's part
[1:17:34] of the Mosaic law that he was given. And
[1:17:37] if you go back in Deuteronomy 24 and1,
[1:17:40] he begins to talk about how that a
[1:17:41] husband, you know, if he finds his wife
[1:17:43] unclean and he puts her away and he
[1:17:45] sends her out with a bill of divorce and
[1:17:48] the second husband would come and and
[1:17:50] find her unclean that he he would give
[1:17:52] her a divor a bill of divorce or that he
[1:17:55] would die.
[1:17:58] The law is here in verse four, he says,
[1:18:00] "For her former husband, which hath sent
[1:18:02] her away, may not take her again to be
[1:18:05] his wife after she is defiled. For that
[1:18:08] is an abomination before the Lord, that
[1:18:11] thou
[1:18:12] shalt not cause the land to sin, which
[1:18:14] the Lord thy God giveth thee for an
[1:18:16] inheritance." So, we know that God puts
[1:18:18] all his laws into motion. And we can
[1:18:21] pick this up in in Mark 10 and verse 4.
[1:18:24] And Jesus is talking to the Pharisees
[1:18:26] because the Pharisees had asked, "What
[1:18:28] should we do with a husband and a wife
[1:18:30] that he wants to put her away?" And he
[1:18:32] says, "And Moses
[1:18:35] and Moses suffered to write a bill of
[1:18:37] divorcement and put her away. And Jesus
[1:18:38] answered and said unto him, for the
[1:18:40] hardness of your heart, he wrote this
[1:18:43] precept.
[1:18:49] But from the beginning of creation of
[1:18:51] God, made them male and female. And for
[1:18:54] this cause a man should leave his father
[1:18:56] and mother mother and clean unto his
[1:18:58] wife and they twain shall be one flesh.
[1:19:00] And so then they shall no more be twain
[1:19:03] but one flesh.
[1:19:05] What therefore God had joined together.
[1:19:07] Let no man put us under. So you see the
[1:19:09] condition that Israel was in that they
[1:19:12] got to such a place that God had the
[1:19:14] right to put him away in a bill of
[1:19:15] divorcement. That there was this this
[1:19:17] law that was put in place. But let me
[1:19:19] tell you something that that wasn't the
[1:19:21] way that God always wanted it.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; He said because of the condition that
[1:19:25] you were in is why Moses wrote that law.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; But he said it wasn't so from the
[1:19:30] beginning.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; He said is it it is until death do us
[1:19:34] part. That's what the love of God toward
[1:19:36] us and toward his children. It's until
[1:19:38] death do us part. That he has a covenant
[1:19:40] of love with each one of us. that it's
[1:19:44] not in a condition that we find
[1:19:45] ourselves in. That sometimes we fall
[1:19:47] away and we make mistakes and we do
[1:19:49] these things, but there's a love,
[1:19:51] there's a ring that God has put on our
[1:19:53] fingermen
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; that we didn't deserve it. We didn't
[1:19:56] earn it.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; But it's because he loves us.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; And yet
[1:20:07] we see that Israel gets in a backsliden
[1:20:09] condition.
[1:20:11] They begin to make idols and put their
[1:20:15] worship toward other gods
[1:20:18] and God would save them many times
[1:20:23] and God would speak to them and they
[1:20:25] would change their lives and it became a
[1:20:28] cycle of Israel.
[1:20:30] And yet, if we're not careful, that's
[1:20:32] what happens with you and I.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; That God is in so in love with you that
[1:20:36] he speaks to you on a Wednesday night.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; And you fall in love with him.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And then you go out in the world and you
[1:20:43] have fellowship with friends and you
[1:20:45] begin to get on your phones and you
[1:20:46] begin to do different things,
[1:20:53] but yet he still loves you. Yeah.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; And you come back on a Sunday and he
[1:20:57] begins to talk to you and he begins to
[1:20:58] love all over you and say, "I love you."
[1:21:01] And you fall in love all over again. And
[1:21:03] what happens?
[1:21:06] The busyiness of life.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; But yet God tonight has a law and a
[1:21:18] covenant of love which he cannot break.
[1:21:23] the message of grace. He says sovereign
[1:21:25] grace can only be given by one that's
[1:21:28] sovereign
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; and God is sovereign.
[1:21:33] So he can give sovereign grace.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Therefore being sovereign grace don't
[1:21:38] have to ask anybody.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; It don't have to.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; It does what it wants to. It's so
[1:21:45] wonderful. It doesn't have to ask can I
[1:21:48] do this or shall I do that or can I must
[1:21:50] I will I
[1:21:53] doesn't do it.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; It does it itself.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Grace is sovereign. He says therefore he
[1:21:59] can save the vilest.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; He can save the worst. He can save the
[1:22:03] impurest. He can save the immoralist. He
[1:22:06] can heal the sick. Hallelujah.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; He can do anything. God can do the
[1:22:11] impossible. Many times we get so bound
[1:22:14] by putting God in a box that that's a
[1:22:16] that's a case too far gone. That
[1:22:18] person's too far lost. They're too
[1:22:20] impure. They've gone too far. Nobody's
[1:22:22] gone too far tonight.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; I know I'm preaching one side of it, but
[1:22:26] let me
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; God can do the impossible.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Think of it. Grace and love and grace is
[1:22:42] sisters. Twin sisters. You can't have
[1:22:44] grace without having love. Twin sisters.
[1:22:49] Exactly right. Before you can have
[1:22:51] grace, you have to have love. Before you
[1:22:53] can actually show somebody a favor, you
[1:22:56] have to love them.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Right or wrong, you have to love them
[1:23:00] anyhow.
[1:23:02] So love and grace
[1:23:05] is the same thing.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; What a profound statement. that you
[1:23:10] can't do one without the other.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham was talking
[1:23:18] and I heard it the other day. He was
[1:23:21] talking about the man that would come up
[1:23:22] and he wanted to beat his brains out.
[1:23:27] And he says, you know, I actually felt
[1:23:29] sorry for that man
[1:23:32] because he didn't want to be in that
[1:23:34] condition.
[1:23:36] You know, many times people get into a
[1:23:38] condition they don't want to be in.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; They don't want to be in that condition.
[1:23:44] They don't want to have those
[1:23:45] characteristics. Maybe somebody offended
[1:23:47] you. Maybe somebody said something to
[1:23:49] you, did you wrong, but maybe it's not
[1:23:51] in their nature. Or maybe their nature's
[1:23:53] a different way. And but they don't want
[1:23:55] to be that way.
[1:23:58] Or maybe God caused it to see your
[1:24:00] reaction.
[1:24:06] because he wants to produce something.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And the only way that's going to happen
[1:24:11] is through trials and tests.
[1:24:21] And Israel got into a place in verse 12,
[1:24:24] he says, "Go and proclaim the words
[1:24:26] toward the toward the north and say,
[1:24:28] Return, thou backslidsing Israel,
[1:24:30] sayaeth the Lord, and I will not cause
[1:24:32] mine anger to fall upon you. For I am
[1:24:35] merciful, sayaeth the Lord. I will keep
[1:24:39] I will not keep my anger forever. Only
[1:24:42] acknowledge." Listen, if you ever get in
[1:24:43] this condition or if you ever get in
[1:24:45] this state, only acknowledge thine
[1:24:48] iniquities that thou hast transgressed
[1:24:50] against the Lord and has scattered their
[1:24:52] ways to the stranger under every green
[1:24:54] tree. And ye have not obeyed my voice,
[1:24:58] and ye have not obeyed my voice, sayaeth
[1:25:00] the Lord. Turn, oh backsliding children,
[1:25:02] sayaeth the Lord, for I am married unto
[1:25:05] you,
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; and I will take you one of a city, two
[1:25:13] of a family, and I will bring you to
[1:25:15] Zion. You see, it's not a group of it's
[1:25:18] not a group affair. It's an individual
[1:25:20] walk with Jesus Christ. You can't just
[1:25:22] come to church and and serve God because
[1:25:25] your parents come to this church. It's
[1:25:27] got to be a very personal walk with
[1:25:29] Jesus Christ because in verse 15 he says
[1:25:32] and I will give you pastors according to
[1:25:34] my own heart which shall feed you
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; with knowledge and understanding.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't say I'll give you a prophet
[1:25:42] that it'll be good
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; but he says I will give you pastors
[1:25:48] and with pastors comes preaching.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; That's why we need the preaching of the
[1:25:54] word.
[1:25:59] And I will give you pastors to give you
[1:26:01] understanding.
[1:26:03] That's why it's important to know your
[1:26:04] pastor.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; To know why you go to the church that
[1:26:09] you go to.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; That you can go to many message churches
[1:26:15] and I'm sure you can get by,
[1:26:18] but God has to reveal unto you a pastor.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:24] that whenever you're called to a posted
[1:26:26] duty, you know where you go to church.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; That it's not this Sunday you go over
[1:26:30] there and that Sunday you go over here
[1:26:31] and you might play a tape cuz it's
[1:26:33] convenient.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; No, but it's a revelation to you.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; That you have a post of duty at that
[1:26:43] church.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:47] that you stay at home on a Wednesday to
[1:26:50] stream this brother and then you come on
[1:26:51] Sunday because the pastor's preaching or
[1:26:53] you do all these things.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; You see, there's many churches all
[1:27:09] around the world,
[1:27:12] but God reveals unto you who your pastor
[1:27:15] is.
[1:27:16] Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Why do you go to this church?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Is it because your family comes here?
[1:27:26] Because when your family leaves, you'll
[1:27:28] leave.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; When somebody falls away, well, there's
[1:27:36] nothing to this message.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not a personal
[1:27:40] relationship with Jesus Christ. It's not
[1:27:42] a personal revelation.
[1:27:49] Jeremiah 3:22 says, "Return ye
[1:27:51] backsliden children, and I will heal
[1:27:54] your backslidings.
[1:27:57] Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art
[1:28:00] our God, the Lord our God." You see, the
[1:28:03] Lord has mercy
[1:28:06] and he shows grace and he shows favor
[1:28:08] upon his children. That is still alive
[1:28:11] and well today. that maybe you're here
[1:28:13] tonight and you're in a certain
[1:28:14] condition or maybe you're streaming and
[1:28:17] you're not where you should be.
[1:28:22] Only acknowledge thine iniquities
[1:28:25] that thou has transgressed against the
[1:28:27] Lord. That his love for you has never
[1:28:30] changed.
[1:28:32] And if his love for you has not changed,
[1:28:34] then our love for you has not changed.
[1:28:44] You see, the truth of brotherly love
[1:28:47] toward a backslider, as I said, is so
[1:28:49] personal
[1:28:54] because they were a part of us or
[1:28:58] you know that they know better.
[1:29:01] We all know somebody that's struggling,
[1:29:03] maybe walked away from the Lord, maybe
[1:29:05] aren't serving them like we they should.
[1:29:08] We all know somebody. We all have a
[1:29:10] family member. We all know somebody that
[1:29:12] is dear to our heart.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And my pull for tonight is that
[1:29:23] you would lift them up in your prayers.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; That you would reach out to them in
[1:29:28] brotherly love and ask them how they're
[1:29:30] doing.
[1:29:33] Because many times they walk away or
[1:29:35] they're they're questioning certain
[1:29:36] things and they begin to get shunned and
[1:29:39] there's no more talking and there's no
[1:29:41] nothing to them
[1:29:47] and it's so hard sometimes.
[1:29:51] But yet if they're his will come back to
[1:29:54] the sheepfold.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother James, are all them
[1:29:58] that walk away from the message his
[1:30:00] seed?" No, I'm not.
[1:30:03] But who am I to judge? Or how do we know
[1:30:05] who's gone too far or who who's not his
[1:30:08] seed and who's not his?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; I say, God, help us
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; to portray the love of God that people
[1:30:18] around us begin to identify. There's
[1:30:20] something different about that person.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; That you can walk through an airport and
[1:30:24] people compliment you on your family and
[1:30:26] say, "You have a lovely family." Why?
[1:30:28] because they're identifying a bond, a
[1:30:30] love between a family. They're
[1:30:32] identifying a harmony that's living out
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; God may use your love to bring their
[1:30:50] healing.
[1:30:53] Your love
[1:31:02] You see, Joseph
[1:31:07] had come to a place
[1:31:12] that he realized,
[1:31:16] forget about the past.
[1:31:19] God hath done this for a purpose.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Why? to preserve life.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; That we have some that walk away or
[1:31:33] maybe some that are struggling. We don't
[1:31:35] understand it all. But yet God has a
[1:31:38] purpose in it.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; God is trying to bring an attribute of
[1:31:42] love not only from their life but from
[1:31:44] your life.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Musicians come first John and 4 and 16
[1:31:56] it says we have known and believe that
[1:31:58] the love of God hath to us God is love
[1:32:02] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[1:32:04] God and God in him herein is our love
[1:32:09] made perfect
[1:32:10] that we may have the boldness in the day
[1:32:13] of judgment
[1:32:16] here is when our love is made perfect
[1:32:17] that in the day of judgment
[1:32:21] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:32:25] Joseph, are you listening tonight?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; That in the day of judgment that it
[1:32:29] becomes to your decision. What are you
[1:32:31] going to choose?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; There is no fear in love, but perfect
[1:32:39] love cast out all fear
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; because fear hath torment. He that
[1:32:44] fearth is not made perfect in love, and
[1:32:46] we love him because he first loved us.
[1:32:50] And if a man say, "I love God," and
[1:32:52] hateth his brother, he is a liar.
[1:32:55] That's pretty hard.
[1:33:00] For he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:33:03] he hath seen, how can he love God whom
[1:33:05] he hath not seen?
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; And this commandment have we from him,
[1:33:14] that he who loveth God loveth his
[1:33:16] brother also.
[1:33:20] I say, "God, help me love my brother."
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; He says, "We
[1:33:32] ought to honor one another, respect one
[1:33:34] another as brother and sister,
[1:33:38] and love one
[1:33:41] another with undying love." You say,
[1:33:43] "Well, I just can't." Well, just stay
[1:33:45] here a little little longer and then you
[1:33:47] will like people too.
[1:33:50] You'll love those who don't love you.
[1:33:52] That's a real good sign of Christianity
[1:33:56] is when you can from your heart love
[1:33:59] those that doesn't love you.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Love the unlovable.
[1:34:08] I say God help us this evening
[1:34:13] to have the love of God in our lives
[1:34:19] that as we begin to build and we can
[1:34:21] live a a good Christian life and we're
[1:34:23] striving
[1:34:27] to come into the perfection
[1:34:30] yet the capstone is love.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:42] Put on therefore as the elect of God,
[1:34:45] holy boughs of mercy, kindness,
[1:34:48] humbleness of mine, meekness,
[1:34:50] longsuffering,
[1:34:52] forbearing one another, forgiving one
[1:34:54] another, and if any man have a quarrel
[1:34:56] against any, even as Christ forgave you,
[1:34:59] so also do you. And above all these
[1:35:02] things, put on charity, which is the
[1:35:04] perfect the bond of perfectness.
[1:35:09] You want the bond of perfectness this
[1:35:11] evening, put on love.
[1:35:16] Love them that hate you. Love them that
[1:35:18] despise you.
[1:35:20] Love them that talk about you.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; It's a sobering thing. Yeah,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; it's a hard thing
[1:35:32] because sometimes it's unexplainable.
[1:35:34] You can't
[1:35:36] put into words sometimes the
[1:35:38] responsibility that we have to love our
[1:35:42] brothers.
[1:35:44] To love ones within the church.
[1:35:51] I say, "God, I don't want to be
[1:35:52] identified by any preaching or anything
[1:35:55] that I do on earth, but I want to be
[1:35:57] identified that he had the love one for
[1:36:00] another."
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; That he would go out of his way to serve
[1:36:04] his brother.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; He would go out of his way to help his
[1:36:08] brother.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; That maybe there's one that's lost their
[1:36:11] way and they've they're struggling and
[1:36:14] they're having a hard time. That you
[1:36:15] would reach down a hand
[1:36:21] Because you see, there's ones that
[1:36:23] whenever you're hurt and you're bitter
[1:36:25] and you're broken,
[1:36:28] that's the evidence that things have
[1:36:30] happened to you.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; That if you have scars in your life,
[1:36:34] that is the evidence that something went
[1:36:35] wrong, something happened.
[1:36:39] And every time you see that, you can
[1:36:41] identify that scar with a hurt, with a
[1:36:43] wound.
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:47] But yeah, may we come to a place in our
[1:36:50] lives that we can look past all that
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; and we can have the love of God.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:37:04] [Music]
[1:37:07] He says, "Living and dying,
[1:37:11] buried and rising, coming." He says,
[1:37:12] "Dear God, I've tried to speak of a love
[1:37:16] that you gave to your church.
[1:37:19] It seems that they've caught they've
[1:37:22] caught up with the miracles of the
[1:37:24] Bible. They've caught up with the
[1:37:25] memberships and the evangelism and
[1:37:27] missionaries and but Lord, let them
[1:37:29] catch up with the love.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; That'll set the church on fire with a
[1:37:33] real gospel love,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; with a real sacred love that could turn
[1:37:39] the cheek.
[1:37:41] or the one that is willing to lay down
[1:37:43] his life.
[1:37:46] If it would mean to save another, God,
[1:37:48] give us that love in our hearts as we
[1:37:52] wait upon you. No greater love hath a
[1:37:55] man that he would lay down his life.
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this gospel love
[1:38:03] says is a million miles different than a
[1:38:05] just a felio love.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] He says it'll make you love a man that
[1:38:12] would come and do something to your
[1:38:14] wife, hurt your children, and make you
[1:38:16] love him.
[1:38:19] Talk about real love.
[1:38:23] And I've seen it. There was a
[1:38:25] documentary on it that a man
[1:38:29] that this man he he had some children.
[1:38:32] They just went down the road just to go
[1:38:34] get some ice cream.
[1:38:38] And a man was driving his truck and he
[1:38:40] crashed into him and killed all three of
[1:38:42] them.
[1:38:46] And yet there came a healing
[1:38:53] only whenever he
[1:38:56] says, "I don't know what it is, but that
[1:38:58] man wasn't in his right mind. He wasn't
[1:39:01] in the condition he should have been. He
[1:39:03] had every right to hate that man.
[1:39:07] He took everything. He took all his kids
[1:39:09] from him.
[1:39:14] But he visited him in the jail cell.
[1:39:18] He says, "Sir, I'm a Christian
[1:39:22] and I love you and I forgive you."
[1:39:29] Could we say the same thing in our life?
[1:39:34] This isn't just some far out story,
[1:39:36] saints. This is everyday living.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; When we get so flared up over somebody
[1:39:44] saying something, somebody doing us
[1:39:46] wrong,
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; I say, God, help us love.
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; The love of God
[1:40:01] is greater far. Let's sing that.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; The love of God
[1:40:12] is gater far
[1:40:17] than tongue or pen.
[1:40:21] You can't ever tell.
[1:40:26] It goes beyond
[1:40:31] the high star
[1:40:35] and reaches through
[1:40:40] the low.
[1:40:44] A guilty fair
[1:40:49] bow down with care.
[1:40:53] God gave his son
[1:40:58] to win
[1:41:02] his
[1:41:04] child.
[1:41:07] be reconciled
[1:41:12] and pardoned from
[1:41:17] his
[1:41:21] oh
[1:41:22] God.
[1:41:25] How rich and pure,
[1:41:30] how measureless
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:36] and strong.
[1:41:39] It shall forever
[1:41:48] the saints and
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:53] shy
[1:41:59] time
[1:42:02] shall pass away
[1:42:07] and earthly.
[1:42:11] And kingoms fall
[1:42:16] when men
[1:42:20] refuse to pray
[1:42:24] on rocks and hills
[1:42:29] and mountains called
[1:42:33] God's love so Sure.
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:38] shall still endure
[1:42:43] all measureless
[1:42:48] and strong
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:52] redeeming
[1:42:53] grace
[1:42:56] to Adam's praise
[1:43:01] the saint
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:08] Love of God.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Oh love of God.
[1:43:14] How rich and pure,
[1:43:19] how measureless
[1:43:24] and strong.
[1:43:28] It shall forever
[1:43:33] more endure
[1:43:37] the saints san.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads and our hearts
[1:43:45] together.
[1:43:49] [Music]
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, the love of God,
[1:43:56] how rich and pure
[1:43:59] How marvelous, oh God, that we can't
[1:44:01] explain it with words. And words fail us
[1:44:04] sometimes.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; But Father, we're so thankful
[1:44:11] that you seen fit to love us.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; That you seen fit to call us, to call us
[1:44:16] your children. That before the
[1:44:18] foundation of the world, you elected us
[1:44:20] to be your royal seed. that there's a
[1:44:22] royal law that lays within your
[1:44:24] scripture that only your children can
[1:44:26] express. Why? Because it's an attribute
[1:44:29] of you.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; I say, Father, help us.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; That as we go from this service and
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:45] Lord, may we show forth your love in
[1:44:47] such a way. Lord,
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; may we love the unlovable.
[1:44:54] May we give grace to those
[1:44:58] Lord that are in need of some grace.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:45:04] how hard it is sometimes and our
[1:45:05] connality gets in the way that
[1:45:09] we want to live by the law
[1:45:13] and you got to do this and you got to
[1:45:15] serve God this way and you if you're not
[1:45:17] a part of this and if you're not doing
[1:45:19] these things how dare you but I say God
[1:45:23] give us love in our hearts
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; and father as we go from this service
[1:45:32] May you go with your people,
[1:45:35] Lord. That we can come back on Sunday
[1:45:37] morning with an expectation in our heart
[1:45:40] with a desire that we want to hear from
[1:45:42] you. Lord,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; that we want to grow in the stature of a
[1:45:46] perfect man. That we want to begin to
[1:45:48] express all the attributes, all the laws
[1:45:50] that were within us. Oh God,
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; we just say we love you and appreciate
[1:45:55] you.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Be with us as we goless
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Brother
[1:46:08] sing could we within
[1:46:12] the ocean fill
[1:46:17] and were the skies
[1:46:21] a parchment made.
[1:46:26] For every sock
[1:46:30] on earth the quill
[1:46:34] and every man
[1:46:39] ascribe by trade
[1:46:43] to write the love
[1:46:47] of God above
[1:46:50] [Music]
[1:46:52] would drain the ocean
[1:46:57] and dry.
[1:47:00] Nor could the scroll
[1:47:05] contain the whole
[1:47:10] stretch from sky
[1:47:14] to sky.
[1:47:18] Oh love of God,
[1:47:22] how rich and pure,
[1:47:27] how measureless
[1:47:32] and strong
[1:47:36] it shall forever
[1:47:40] more into
[1:47:44] the saints and a
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:53] Let's just sing one more before we go.
[1:47:56] Seen that song, Amazing Love.
[1:48:02] I'm forgiven
[1:48:05] because you were forsaken.
[1:48:11] I'm accepted.
[1:48:14] You were condemned.
[1:48:18] And I am alive and well. Your spirit
[1:48:23] lives within me

[1:48:32] Amazing love.
[1:48:35] Amazing love.
[1:48:38] How can it be?
[1:48:44] So my king would die for me.

[1:49:13] I'm forgiven.
[1:49:15] Yes, I'm forgiven.
[1:49:18] Because you were forsaken.
[1:49:24] I'm accepted.
[1:49:27] You were condemned
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:32] and I am alive and well. Your spirit is
[1:49:37] within me
[1:49:39] because you died and rose again.
[1:49:45] Amazing love.
[1:49:48] Amazing love.
[1:49:51] How can it be
[1:49:56] that you my king would die for me?
[1:50:02] Amazing
[1:50:03] [Music]
[1:50:05] love.
[1:50:07] Yes, I know it's true.
[1:50:12] Yes, it's my joy to honor you.
[1:50:18] In all I do,
[1:50:23] I honor you. You're my king.
[1:50:28] Lord, you
[1:50:31] are my king.
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:36] Oh, you
[1:50:39] are my king.
[1:50:43] Lord Jesus, you
[1:50:47] are my king.
[1:50:51] Jesus, you
[1:50:55] are my king. Amazing love.
[1:51:01] Amazing love
[1:51:04] found
[1:51:05] in me
[1:51:09] that you, my king, would die for me.
[1:51:15] Amazing
[1:51:18] love.
[1:51:20] I know it's true.
[1:51:25] And it's my joy to honor you.
[1:51:31] In all I do,
[1:51:35] I honor you.
[1:51:40] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Dear Lord

[1:51:51] spirit, Lord. Thank you for your love,
[1:51:54] Lord. Thank you for the service that
[1:51:56] we've we've heard, Lord. Just the
[1:51:58] reminder, Lord, of your love for us and
[1:52:01] just that we would follow through, Lord.
[1:52:04] that we would be sensitive to your
[1:52:05] spirit, that we would love one another,
[1:52:08] love our neighbors, Lord, that we would
[1:52:09] show the love of God to this world.
[1:52:12] Lord, we love you tonight. We ask that
[1:52:13] you'd be with us as we go our separate
[1:52:15] ways. Lord, be with our pastor as he as
[1:52:18] he travels. Brother Mario, Lord, Lord,
[1:52:20] be with the needs among us. We love you.
[1:52:22] We ask these things tonight in Jesus
[1:52:24] precious name. Amen.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you would just remember the
[1:52:30] the sign up for family night just on the
[1:52:32] bulletin board. You were dismissed
[1:52:34] tonight. Amen. God bless you.
