[35:19] out of my heart for a while it's a song
[35:21] that I think um brother Robert said uh
[35:24] that David wrote Psalms and that he put
[35:27] into songs and I can imagine this might
[35:29] have been a song that he uh that he
[35:33] wrote when he was feeling a little bit
[35:34] distant from God and it's my prayer this
[35:37] this
[35:38] [Music]
[35:54] morning just the time I I
[35:58] feel that I've been caught in the M of
[36:07] self just the time I
[36:11] feel my mind's been bought by
[36:17] worldly
[36:18] [Music]
[36:19] wealth that's when the breeze
[36:24] begins to blow I I know the
[36:30] spirit
[36:33] call and all my worldly
[36:39] wonderings just melt
[36:42] into his
[36:46] love and oh I want to know you
[36:51] more deep within my soul I want to know
[36:56] you oh oh I want to know you to feel
[37:01] your heart and know your mind looking in
[37:06] your eyes stirs up within me cries that
[37:10] say I want to know
[37:15] you oh I want to know you
[37:24] more and when my daily
[37:29] Deeds
[37:32] ordinarily lose life and
[37:37] song My Heart begins to bleed
[37:44] sensitivity to him is
[37:49] gone I've run the race but set my own
[37:55] pace and face
[37:58] a shattered
[38:01] soul but the gentle Arms of Jesus War my
[38:09] hungering to
[38:13] behold and oh I want to know you
[38:18] more deep within my soul I want to know
[38:23] you oh I want to know you to feel your
[38:29] heart and know your
[38:31] mind looking in your eyes stirs up
[38:34] within me cries that say I want to know

[38:47] give my final breath to know you in your
[38:52] death and
[38:54] Resurrection oh I want to know you

[45:07] house Lord to learn of you yes I pray
[45:11] father that you would open our eyes of
[45:14] understanding father and let us take
[45:16] this book and eat it and become a part
[45:19] of it that we would become a living
[45:21] epistle in this last day that our voice
[45:25] would be Blended together as a sound of
[45:29] many
[45:30] Waters joining with the voices of those

[46:22] and then we'll go to Revelation
[46:25] 19 amen certainly enjoyed the song
[46:28] specials amen I believe that when you
[46:31] have the victory of Christ in your life
[46:34] doesn't mean you won't go through trials
[46:36] doesn't mean that you won't be tested
[46:38] but it means that you will be an
[46:41] overcomer not an undergoer yeah too much
[46:44] of the time I'm undergoing this I'm
[46:46] undergoing that well the scriptures says
[46:50] to he that hath an ear let him hear and
[46:54] those in each age became the
[46:58] Overcomers so that's your
[47:00] destiny to overcome laiaa to overcome
[47:05] all of the things that come against
[47:08] you amen because we've been made more
[47:12] than conquerors through Christ somebody
[47:15] say through Christ who strengthens us
[47:18] amen Matthew
[47:20] 25 verses
[47:24] 1-10 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[47:28] likened unto 10
[47:30] virgins which took their lamps and went
[47:33] forth to meet the
[47:36] bridegroom five of them were wise and
[47:39] five were
[47:42] foolish they that were
[47:44] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[47:48] with
[47:50] them but the wise took oil in their
[47:54] vessels with their lamps and while the
[47:57] bridegroom
[47:58] teed they all slumbered and
[48:02] slept and at midnight there was a cry
[48:05] made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye
[48:09] out to meet
[48:10] him then all those virgins arose and
[48:14] trimmed their lamps notice the cry woke
[48:17] all of them up F uh five wise five
[48:20] foolish
[48:21] yes so there is a quickening that's
[48:24] happened in this our day that's caused
[48:27] us to realize he's
[48:30] coming get ready yeah amen watch this
[48:34] now and the fully said unto the
[48:38] wise excuse let's go back verse 7 then
[48:41] all those virgins arose and trim their
[48:43] lamps and the foi said unto the wise
[48:46] give us of your oil for our lamps are
[48:48] gone out but the wise answered and
[48:51] saying not so lest there be not enough
[48:55] for us and you but go ye rather to them
[48:59] that sell and buy for
[49:02] yourselves and while they went to buy
[49:06] the bridegroom came and they that were
[49:09] ready went in with him to the marriage
[49:13] and the door was shut I want you to
[49:15] notice verse 10 as we read it again and
[49:19] while they went to BU the bridegroom
[49:21] came and they that were ready went in
[49:25] with him to the marage marage and the
[49:28] door was
[49:30] shut afterward came also the other
[49:32] virgins Lord Lord open to us but he
[49:35] answered and said verily Ascend to you I
[49:38] know you
[49:40] not watch therefore for you know neither
[49:44] the day nor the hour where the son of
[49:46] man
[49:47] cometh
[49:49] amen turn with me now to the Book of
[49:52] Luke
[49:54] 12: 39
[50:02] and I gave the Brethren 39 through 40
[50:05] but I'm going to read to
[50:09] 43 be therefore ready
[50:12] also for the son of man cometh at an
[50:16] hour when you think not then Peter said
[50:19] unto him Lord speakest thou this Parable
[50:23] unto
[50:24] us or even to all
[50:28] the Lord said who then is that faithful
[50:30] and wise
[50:32] Steward whom he whom his Lord hath made
[50:37] ruler over his household to give them
[50:41] their portion of meat in due
[50:45] season blessed is that servant whom his
[50:49] Lord when he cometh shall find so
[50:54] doing amen
[50:57] notice the theme that you see that is
[51:00] going to tie all of this together this
[51:03] morning is therefore be ready amen amen
[51:08] turn with me the Book of Revelation
[51:10] chapter 19 Book of Revelation
[51:20] 19 and we will read down to verse 10
[51:30] starting at verse
[51:33] 5 and a voice came out of the throne
[51:35] saying praise our God all ye his
[51:38] servants and ye that fear Him both small
[51:41] and great and I heard as it were the
[51:44] voice of a great
[51:46] multitude and as the voice of many
[51:49] Waters and as the voice of Mighty
[51:52] thunderings saying Allelujah for the
[51:55] Lord God omnipotent
[51:58] reth let us be glad and rejoice and give
[52:01] honor to
[52:02] him for the marriage of the Lamb is come
[52:06] and his wife hath made herself ready
[52:09] amen notice that word ready again are
[52:12] you
[52:13] ready
[52:15] amen and to her was granted that she
[52:18] should be arrayed in fine linen clean
[52:21] and white for the fine linen is the
[52:23] righteousness of saints amen and he said
[52:26] saith unto me right blessed are they
[52:28] which are called un the married supper
[52:30] of the
[52:31] lamb and he saith unto me these are the
[52:34] true sayings of
[52:37] God
[52:39] Amen and it says and I fell at his feet
[52:42] to worship him and said unto me see thou
[52:45] do it not I am thy fellow servant and of
[52:49] thy Brethren that have the testimony of
[52:51] Jesus worship God am for the testimony
[52:56] of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy may
[53:00] God bless the reading of his word this
[53:02] morning you may be
[53:04] seated in his presence amen thank
[53:10] you I'd like to take for a short time
[53:14] this morning just want to be sensitized
[53:17] and led of the Holy
[53:20] Spirit and I want to speak on a the
[53:24] title of
[53:25] quickened by by the Midnight Cry to make
[53:28] ready to meet
[53:29] him now what is this message all about
[53:32] come on brother us is about how to go to
[53:36] church how to
[53:38] dress I'm afraid that's sometimes what
[53:40] we've boiled it down
[53:44] to amen and I take a subject this
[53:48] morning is
[53:50] revelation makes preparation that's
[53:53] right tell me you believe this message
[53:56] tell me you have Revelation let me see
[53:57] it manifested in your
[54:01] life because Revelation is
[54:05] Vision it's seeing yes now we do not
[54:09] want to be a Pharisee of
[54:11] Pharisees concerning the law blam us we
[54:14] don't want to be like Saul of Tarsus who
[54:19] had a religious spirit about him and he
[54:22] was persecuting even the Church of God
[54:24] but on the road to Damas us there that
[54:27] elect seed God got a hold of him knocked
[54:31] him off his high horse and into the dust
[54:33] where he
[54:34] belongs and he said Lord who art thou he
[54:37] said I'm Jesus whom thou
[54:39] persecutest isn't it hard to kick
[54:41] against the Pricks and here it was that
[54:44] God had to Blind him physically to open
[54:49] his eyes of understanding that's right
[54:52] amen and what's an amazing thing is that
[54:55] channel of the Holy spirit that he got
[54:58] into he went and and spent a couple
[55:02] years off in seeking the mind of God
[55:05] when he came out he and the disciples
[55:07] are speaking the same thing how many of
[55:10] you believe that God has got a channel
[55:13] that he wants all of you to get
[55:19] into
[55:22] now I'm going to substantiate some of
[55:25] this of what we have
[55:28] taken as a
[55:30] title and in the sermon the sudden
[55:33] secret going away the church brother
[55:35] Brenham says some people say well I go
[55:38] to church this Sunday I listen to our
[55:41] pastor which is a fine
[55:44] preacher that's good I appreciate that
[55:46] in you or America the world whatever it
[55:49] is but it takes more than a good message
[55:52] from the
[55:54] pulpit it takes your life it takes you
[55:57] to get ready that's
[55:59] right in Revelations the 19th Chapter
[56:02] 7th verse the Bible said that speaking
[56:05] of the bride of Christ she hath made
[56:08] herself
[56:10] ready she made herself ready and you as
[56:13] a member of this bride you've got to
[56:15] make yourself ready if you miss
[56:19] it and you fail to prepare and get ready
[56:24] there's only one to blame your
[56:28] pastor huh the preacher come on brother
[56:31] how about the
[56:37] prophet if you miss it it's because of
[56:40] your own
[56:43] foolishness now I as a pastor want to
[56:45] make
[56:47] everyone within the
[56:49] assembly from foolish to wise but I
[56:52] realize we can't do
[56:54] it and your life right now testifies of
[56:58] which direction you're going show me who
[57:01] you fellowship with show me what you do
[57:03] and I'll show you the direction you're
[57:08] going
[57:10] amen foolish love to hang around
[57:15] foolish and wise love to hang around
[57:18] those that are
[57:19] wise amen why because the wise have
[57:22] something in common they love to talk
[57:24] about one thing that's the word yes amen
[57:26] not the world not the things of the
[57:29] world because listen if you love the
[57:30] world and the things of the world the
[57:32] love of God is not even in
[57:36] you in the uniting time and sign brother
[57:40] Brenham picks this up again like the
[57:43] wise men coming down from Babylon they
[57:45] screamed where is he born King of the
[57:48] Jews he's on Earth right now we've got
[57:51] to find him that's right and I believe
[57:54] he's so close to coming coming that I
[57:57] can say behold the bridegroom coming I
[58:00] hear the Midnight Cry how many of you
[58:02] can say I can say I've heard that
[58:05] Midnight
[58:08] Cry hallelujah we're right at the time
[58:11] of the end oh my the hour we're living
[58:14] in what a day what a time we're living
[58:17] in this great mystery of God being
[58:20] finished bringing in the godhead showing
[58:23] what it is and those little isms and
[58:25] went off and
[58:26] made him this and somebody made him this
[58:29] and somebody made him that but the angel
[58:31] of the Lord come down and brought up all
[58:35] their isms and put all that truth out of
[58:37] it and presented it and there it is just
[58:42] as perfect as it can be no other way you
[58:45] could go there it is that's what he is
[58:49] see he's a serpent seed all these
[58:51] different things that's been so
[58:53] mysteriously amongst the people see what
[58:56] is it see he had this is the sign to
[59:00] what
[59:02] unite amen this message has came come to
[59:08] unite you with the
[59:12] bridegroom not to just introduce
[59:16] you but to actually unite to cause an
[59:20] invisible
[59:23] Union amen
[59:26] I've been
[59:28] studying and sometimes I
[59:32] think studying hath made me
[59:36] mad I think everybody ought to see what
[59:38] I see
[59:40] am I remember my Damascus experience and
[59:44] let me just tell you
[59:47] personally yes I came into the
[59:52] message 1971 over in California Surfer
[59:56] not knowing much of
[59:59] nothing we came in listening to the
[1:00:01] tapes God began to open our eyes and
[1:00:04] every time we listened to a tape it was
[1:00:07] another chunk of the world just being
[1:00:08] taken off of each one of
[1:00:10] us and we were so sincere you need to be
[1:00:14] sincere when you come to church and you
[1:00:17] ask God
[1:00:20] Amen and so then it wound up we were up
[1:00:24] in Flagstaff
[1:00:26] we were there I was a deacon that's
[1:00:28] where I became an ordained
[1:00:30] minister long story
[1:00:34] short I found out that we talked about
[1:00:37] the message but never really preached
[1:00:41] it you can refer to it sure and there
[1:00:44] was a time when you used to say and God
[1:00:46] sent a prophet Revelations 10:7 yeah
[1:00:49] Revelation 107 belt buckles fact we got
[1:00:53] a whole new generation it's got a new
[1:00:55] belt buckle
[1:00:57] I think it who is it Austin Johnson have
[1:01:00] are you wearing yours this
[1:01:02] morning he he he had one custom
[1:01:06] designed well it's not your bell book
[1:01:09] I'm not making fun of it in fact he can
[1:01:11] make me one of those if he
[1:01:13] wants but what I'm saying it's not the
[1:01:16] Bell Buckle makes you a Believer neither
[1:01:18] is it a sign on your
[1:01:20] bumper nor is it the amount of books
[1:01:23] that you have in your library or the
[1:01:25] amount of tapes that you listen to
[1:01:27] brother Brenham said that little washer
[1:01:29] woman with one tape can make it because
[1:01:32] what she will do she lines up to the
[1:01:34] word what she
[1:01:36] hears hallelujah how many of you say I
[1:01:39] want to line
[1:01:40] up
[1:01:42] amen hallelujah help us Lord to do that
[1:01:46] which is
[1:01:50] right and it
[1:01:52] was when I went
[1:01:54] overseas now back when voice of God
[1:01:58] started sending out those
[1:02:00] little boxes of tapes cuz we couldn't
[1:02:03] afford to get a complete
[1:02:05] Library so they used to send you a box
[1:02:07] of tapes any of you were on that tape
[1:02:10] list where you got a box of tapes and
[1:02:12] you didn't get more until you paid those
[1:02:14] off then they sent you another
[1:02:17] one well we were getting our collection
[1:02:22] of tapes and listening to it and
[1:02:26] and everything but anyway our pastor
[1:02:28] asked me he said Brother Juan would you
[1:02:29] like to go over we're considering
[1:02:32] opening a spoken word office in Europe
[1:02:36] to get out the books and different
[1:02:38] things of the Prophet it wound up that
[1:02:41] we went over there and then it after a
[1:02:43] year and a half it changed from spoken
[1:02:45] word Publications to voice of God and so
[1:02:49] here's what
[1:02:50] happened you put me into an
[1:02:53] office and give me ,200
[1:02:57] tapes surround me with the
[1:03:01] books and the work that I was doing of
[1:03:04] people writing a letter please send me
[1:03:06] tapes and send me these books and etc
[1:03:09] etc and while I was working I'd put
[1:03:12] tapes on and I listen to them in
[1:03:14] chronological
[1:03:16] order wow
[1:03:19] wow I was like a kid in a candy store
[1:03:22] amen oh look at this oh man I've never
[1:03:25] heard heard of this
[1:03:26] sermon oh wow I just put it on and
[1:03:29] listening to tape so I want you to know
[1:03:32] that that was my demascus experience and
[1:03:35] God opened my eyes of understanding and
[1:03:38] pretty soon when you see the revealing
[1:03:40] of the son of man you go beyond looking
[1:03:43] at the first and second
[1:03:44] pool oh that was wonderful the signs and
[1:03:48] the discernments Oh how we we we love
[1:03:51] that but that was only to get the
[1:03:53] attraction because there was a great G
[1:03:56] attraction that was behind all that
[1:03:58] because many of those that that love the
[1:04:01] signs and the Wonders the fishes the
[1:04:03] loaves the healings and everything where
[1:04:06] are they today many of them did not go
[1:04:08] on into the revealing of the son of
[1:04:11] man some of them just stayed right there
[1:04:15] and got high
[1:04:17] sitter
[1:04:20] amen and
[1:04:23] there in a little office
[1:04:28] the name of our village was
[1:04:30] Caren Caren alar that's not German
[1:04:33] that's
[1:04:35] Dutch otherwise it'd be kiria alter
[1:04:39] kiria but we were from a village that
[1:04:41] during the second world war or just
[1:04:44] before it it split up into two
[1:04:47] Villages church and old church Caren
[1:04:51] means Church Al and no
[1:04:55] so anyway we were from the old
[1:05:00] church I like
[1:05:04] that so here we were in car and
[1:05:08] Alder and we had an office for spoken
[1:05:12] word and then later voice of
[1:05:14] God but it was there saints of God that
[1:05:17] my eyes became
[1:05:19] open oh I've been in the message I've
[1:05:22] been rejoicing about it I was a deacon
[1:05:26] we went to church I've been fanatical
[1:05:28] about this message and going to church
[1:05:30] ever since I came into it I'm still that
[1:05:33] way amen God thank you Lord
[1:05:37] amen and when I came over to visit in
[1:05:42] America and I started
[1:05:45] preaching some of even the elders within
[1:05:48] the message we're talking
[1:05:50] icon
[1:05:52] ministers said well that's what's wrong
[1:05:55] with you
[1:05:56] young preachers you always talking about
[1:06:01] revelation God Revelation this
[1:06:04] Revelation that and I said well what do
[1:06:06] you preach
[1:06:09] from because if it's not
[1:06:12] Revelation see to he that hath an ear
[1:06:15] let him hear what the spirit because the
[1:06:17] spirit is trying to get something over
[1:06:19] to you more than going to church more
[1:06:22] than how to dress more to not cut your
[1:06:25] hair and wear makeup and all that stuff
[1:06:28] those are some of the basics but God
[1:06:30] wants to pull you into the place where
[1:06:34] you have a solid rock
[1:06:36] foundation and Upon This
[1:06:39] Rock of Revelation I will build my
[1:06:43] church it's got to be
[1:06:46] revealed not what some man teaches
[1:06:50] you not the Creeds and the dogmas and
[1:06:53] rules and regulations
[1:06:56] that's a part of it but if we stop there
[1:06:59] then our children become conformed and
[1:07:01] not
[1:07:02] transformed and our people become
[1:07:07] churchi oh I love to have brother Salas
[1:07:11] you're talking about a devil chasing
[1:07:14] gospel am that when Revelation strikes
[1:07:18] you let me tell you the devil will fear
[1:07:21] and Quake when you get out of
[1:07:24] bed
[1:07:26] amen amen oh there he is he's getting
[1:07:29] out of bed run right now while you can
[1:07:32] cuz he's liable to cut your
[1:07:35] head
[1:07:38] off amen Revelation does
[1:07:42] that thank you Lord and Saul when God
[1:07:45] opened his eyes of understanding he said
[1:07:49] all of my former
[1:07:51] learning is
[1:07:53] D do you understand understand that am
[1:07:57] and he began to catch the
[1:07:59] revelation of what God was doing in that
[1:08:02] hour he began to to understand
[1:08:05] recognizing your day and its message how
[1:08:09] many of you right understand that it is
[1:08:12] a revelation about your day and your
[1:08:16] message amen that's part of the mystery
[1:08:19] that's
[1:08:20] being
[1:08:22] finished because you're a part of that
[1:08:25] in a mystery that's right so therefore
[1:08:28] even when you didn't know you were a
[1:08:31] part of it guess what God did he calls
[1:08:33] you thank you Jesus am and he starts now
[1:08:36] revealing himself to you line upon line
[1:08:41] precept upon precept and he does it not
[1:08:45] all at once cuz you couldn't handle
[1:08:49] it so what happens is you get upgrades
[1:08:56] praise the Lord that's what happens yeah
[1:08:59] uh happens to your
[1:09:01] computer if it's under the signal if
[1:09:04] it's under the footprint if it's under
[1:09:05] the cloud and all of a sudden you go to
[1:09:08] look at your computer and said oh hey
[1:09:10] you just had an upgrade yeah you're now
[1:09:14] with Windows 2.0 or
[1:09:17] whatever right yeah okay great do you
[1:09:21] know that when you come to church and
[1:09:23] you sit here under the cloud on come on
[1:09:26] and you're under the inspiration you
[1:09:28] sitting right there automatically get an
[1:09:31] upgrade that's why going to church is
[1:09:33] very important yes sir amen though you
[1:09:36] may not know it something's
[1:09:38] downloading like that and put on your
[1:09:40] hard drive because the Holy Spirit
[1:09:43] listen to me now the holy spirit is to
[1:09:45] lead and guide you into all truth and
[1:09:48] bring to
[1:09:49] youre remembrance those things which
[1:09:52] you've heard before if it's not on your
[1:09:55] hard drive you sit there like a cow
[1:09:58] looking at a new
[1:10:00] gate you have no idea what they're
[1:10:02] talking about but when the Holy Spirit
[1:10:05] comes and anoints something you have
[1:10:08] already heard all of a sudden my
[1:10:11] goodness it's one of those aha
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:16] moments Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:10:19] church amen every one of you have got to
[1:10:24] have the
[1:10:25] type of experiences amen amen cu the
[1:10:31] message is Christ abolutely and the
[1:10:34] testimony of
[1:10:36] Christ is the
[1:10:39] spirit of Prophecy amen that's why
[1:10:45] without the spirit you miss it yeah
[1:10:48] that's right oh you can start to learn
[1:10:51] its
[1:10:52] dogmas its Creeds it's
[1:10:55] Traditions
[1:10:58] yeah and you conform to
[1:11:01] it that's why you can preach a
[1:11:04] conforming gospel for years and people
[1:11:08] conform to it right yeah and by the
[1:11:11] pressure of the ministry I'll tell you
[1:11:14] what sister you put on that uh uh
[1:11:17] immoral dress and on on you cut your
[1:11:19] hair you wear that makeup Jezebel D and
[1:11:22] all this amen and pretty soon everybody
[1:11:24] con Ms cuz they're afraid
[1:11:28] yeah
[1:11:30] exactly amen God doesn't control You by
[1:11:37] fear is it because of law or because of
[1:11:41] love he said if you love
[1:11:43] me you keep my commandment you start
[1:11:46] working on falling more in love with him
[1:11:49] and guess what it's not the law it's
[1:11:51] because I'm in love you guys don't
[1:11:53] understand I do this not not because

[1:12:54] you
[1:12:57] I've been fanatical about this
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:03] message since I came into
[1:13:06] it I don't look for excuses on why to
[1:13:09] miss
[1:13:11] church huh how many of you know that God
[1:13:16] the scriptures talks about a parable
[1:13:17] there was a king who had a
[1:13:19] feast and invited those to a wedding
[1:13:23] that's right and to the supper
[1:13:25] y yeah and one by one they begin to make
[1:13:29] excuse right well I um I'm going to get

[1:13:46] business I'm I I I'm expanding my barn
[1:13:50] what's your
[1:13:52] excuse I've been a fanatic for this
[1:13:55] message it used to be hey up in Flag we
[1:13:57] was a hunting Church yeah everybody
[1:14:00] would got bit up there in flab by the
[1:14:02] hunting
[1:14:04] bud but I was just fanatical enough that
[1:14:09] I would not leave Friday night after
[1:14:11] work to go hunting most of the time the
[1:14:15] vast majority of the
[1:14:16] time I left Sunday after
[1:14:20] service I get up there late and
[1:14:22] everybody El several of Brothers got
[1:14:24] their tents and everything here I come
[1:14:25] in driving at night got to turn on the
[1:14:28] lights and thank the Lord those Brothers
[1:14:30] help me put up my tent in the
[1:14:34] dark and then guess what Monday through
[1:14:37] Friday we hunted or through
[1:14:40] Saturday because you know what I got to
[1:14:42] provide for my
[1:14:44] family yeah man I got to get I'm a meat
[1:14:46] Hunter I'm a I'mma shoot anything that
[1:14:49] moves I'm putting meat on my
[1:14:53] table oh my after I spent $1,200 for a
[1:14:57] new
[1:14:59] rifle after I got new boots had to put a
[1:15:03] camper shell on my truck had to get a
[1:15:06] tent you know and so by the time you add
[1:15:08] up the total of what it cost me to go
[1:15:11] get that meat I could have gone to
[1:15:14] Costco and filled my freezer for a
[1:15:18] year I ain't got to go out there and
[1:15:20] then guess what I uh every day
[1:15:23] hunting getting up early
[1:15:27] before man walk your legs off I remember
[1:15:31] we saw some deer we're at kyab North kab
[1:15:34] wow and they got all these little um
[1:15:38] tributaries and and and whatever you
[1:15:41] call them so here's this little Hill and
[1:15:43] comes out here and goes down then you
[1:15:45] got a valley you got another one over
[1:15:46] here Hills and Valleys and everything we
[1:15:49] were out there hunting and brother Mitch
[1:15:52] Buckingham he was with us and he saw a
[1:15:55] big old
[1:15:57] Buck Hey listen if you don't get Buck
[1:16:00] Fever when you hunt then you shouldn't
[1:16:04] hunt it just get you so excited so he
[1:16:06] saw this big bug big fourpoint buck and
[1:16:09] he was down in the valley Mitch was up
[1:16:11] here on the top and he runs down here
[1:16:14] trying to get to him as quick as he can
[1:16:16] well the deer saw him heard him like
[1:16:19] this so the deer he runs up the to the
[1:16:22] top of the hill on the other side and
[1:16:24] and Mitch sees him okay I'm going to so
[1:16:28] he breaks and runs out so the guy trots
[1:16:30] off over the top and guess what when he
[1:16:33] gets to the top Mitch
[1:16:36] is thing's not very far from me he's
[1:16:40] going and then he drops off into it well
[1:16:43] he keeps doing
[1:16:47] this never did get the
[1:16:49] but you see a lot of times we spend all
[1:16:52] this time that's energy w here let me
[1:16:55] tell you hunting is not financially
[1:17:01] beneficial it's going to cost you a lot
[1:17:03] you can say well I'm bringing home meat
[1:17:05] no go to Costco you can bring home all
[1:17:07] the meat you want but if you do like to
[1:17:10] hunt and everything well then go for it
[1:17:13] just go hunting that's fine but give God
[1:17:16] what is
[1:17:18] God's amen and I would leave Saturday to
[1:17:21] drive all the way home six hours or so
[1:17:25] to be in church for Sunday and after
[1:17:28] Sunday I drive back now some of the
[1:17:31] Brethren I'm not I'm not riging on
[1:17:34] somebody's parade that well we're going
[1:17:36] to stay there for the weekend and it's
[1:17:38] too far to drive back home I know you're
[1:17:40] not fanatical you're not uh a heresy
[1:17:44] like I am I don't expect you all to be
[1:17:47] that
[1:17:48] way but I
[1:17:51] am I love this message with a ferency
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:57] I don't try to find an excuse of why or
[1:18:00] to go some somewhere else or whatever I
[1:18:05] put Priority on the word of God because
[1:18:08] saints of God ever since I came into
[1:18:10] this message I realized I've got to be
[1:18:14] focused huh I got a fouryear scholarship
[1:18:18] to San Diego State University I went my
[1:18:20] first year I got a 3.83 grade point
[1:18:23] average I loved College I loved the
[1:18:27] university I I went to to to lunch with
[1:18:30] my
[1:18:32] professors you got to be kidding me I
[1:18:34] enjoyed it high school was a bunch of
[1:18:36] Misfits people that didn't want to be
[1:18:39] there they had to take your name and uh
[1:18:41] Ron Peterson are you here yeah John do
[1:18:43] are you here yeah yeah yeah here presid
[1:18:46] and in colleagues they don't do I could
[1:18:48] care less you guys pay to come here
[1:18:52] so I I wound up I turned on in college I
[1:18:56] enjoyed it wasn't not a problem for me
[1:19:01] but then I found
[1:19:03] out I was going in a wrong direction I
[1:19:05] came to this message the Way Up Is Down
[1:19:10] amen and a tree of knowledge and all of
[1:19:13] well
[1:19:15] my and how do you think my parents felt
[1:19:17] when I told them after my first year of
[1:19:20] college that I'm quitting I'm going to
[1:19:22] become a Christian
[1:19:25] yeah we're all Christians cuz we're born
[1:19:27] in America oh yeah America is a
[1:19:30] Christian Nation praise God we're all
[1:19:34] Christians that makes about as much
[1:19:36] sense as saying I slept in the garage
[1:19:38] makes you a
[1:19:40] car in fact America is no longer it's a
[1:19:43] secular
[1:19:44] nation and Christians are going to
[1:19:46] become persecuted cuz watch what they're
[1:19:49] doing against with the anti-Semitism
[1:19:52] that they're doing against Israel
[1:19:54] remember
[1:19:55] that the foolish virgin is going to be a
[1:19:57] hunted down persecuted little group how
[1:20:01] many know that and they have to give
[1:20:02] their
[1:20:07] lives we don't want to be here during
[1:20:09] the
[1:20:10] tribulation no God help
[1:20:12] me Lord Brother Brenham told Billy Paul
[1:20:15] Billy whatever you do you make the
[1:20:18] Rapture and don't you yeah he said you
[1:20:21] miss that tribulation yeah
[1:20:25] okay amen
[1:20:27] amen so I began to look at the message
[1:20:31] and everything and really if you boil it
[1:20:34] on all down to one thing I want to ask
[1:20:38] you what is the message all
[1:20:43] about and I will end my sermon with the
[1:20:46] two quotes that I want to show you but I
[1:20:48] just I'm going to throw this out there
[1:20:50] to
[1:20:51] you God sent an angel messenger yes
[1:20:55] who was visited by a Heavenly
[1:21:00] Angel to preach a message to get a bride
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:06] ready so the message has one intent and
[1:21:10] purpose to get you ready so that you can
[1:21:13] get out of here amen now yes you got to
[1:21:15] have a job you got to have a house Jesus
[1:21:18] said your heavenly father knows you have
[1:21:20] need of all these things but seek ye
[1:21:23] first me say first first see the
[1:21:27] priority seek first the kingdom of God
[1:21:30] cuz he knows you have need of these
[1:21:32] things but he said doesn't he provide
[1:21:36] even for the Little Sparrow amen amen
[1:21:39] how much more so will your heavenly
[1:21:41] father
[1:21:43] pre come on okay so I thank
[1:21:48] God that he opened my eyes of
[1:21:52] understanding that when we came into
[1:21:54] this
[1:21:59] message I began to see a picture
[1:22:06] unfold I said
[1:22:08] my Bible days are here
[1:22:13] again Abraham
[1:22:16] mzc
[1:22:18] signs in the heavens signs on earth a
[1:22:22] prophet Speaking In The Name Of The Lord
[1:22:24] thus sayith the Lord my I began to see
[1:22:27] Elijah Mount Carmel I began to see
[1:22:31] Jezebel religion I want to ask you
[1:22:33] denominational Spirit comes from
[1:22:37] Jezebel that's organization
[1:22:40] denominational Spirit and the Bible says
[1:22:42] all those whose names are not written in
[1:22:44] the Lamb's Book of Life shall be
[1:22:46] deceived you know what deceptions going
[1:22:48] on right now listen people don't even
[1:22:50] know what gender they're of they they
[1:22:53] can believe they're a cat or a dog
[1:22:57] whatever somebody asked me the other day
[1:22:59] well what do you identify
[1:23:01] as I said a
[1:23:04] Believer and I'm correct and I identify
[1:23:07] as correct you don't like it you better
[1:23:10] accept me because I want you to say I am
[1:23:16] correct a that what everybody's wants is
[1:23:19] that self-acceptance hey so you can say
[1:23:21] brother Ron you're correct you're right
[1:23:26] nobody said it
[1:23:28] Robert see I don't need that personal
[1:23:31] affirmation for you to say it I believe
[1:23:36] it I believe
[1:23:39] it
[1:23:41] now in is this the sign of the end
[1:23:46] sir what are these what are these
[1:23:48] sermons all about you take the sermon
[1:23:52] title alone and in itself is a sermon
[1:23:56] and when he asks you a question s is
[1:24:00] this the sign of the
[1:24:03] end what's the sign and when is the end
[1:24:08] what is this
[1:24:10] attraction who do you say this
[1:24:15] is do you see he he begins to now cause
[1:24:20] you to come into a greater spiritual
[1:24:24] understanding
[1:24:25] here we were just a bunch of surfers and
[1:24:28] rock and roll music and drugs and all
[1:24:30] this stuff and man let me tell you when
[1:24:34] when God begin to open our
[1:24:40] eyes every tape another
[1:24:43] Revelation another tape another
[1:24:46] Revelation
[1:24:48] and I can say it's still
[1:24:52] happening thank you I try to listen to a
[1:24:55] tape every day yes I
[1:24:58] do I have to seek the mind of God I
[1:25:02] don't do this because I'm a pastor I did
[1:25:04] it when I was sitting on the Pew amen
[1:25:08] amen you've got to
[1:25:10] seek wisdom from God so brother Ram says
[1:25:13] here s is this the sign of the
[1:25:17] end because it's given to you his
[1:25:20] disciples it's given to you to know the
[1:25:22] mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but
[1:25:25] not to
[1:25:27] them to them it is not
[1:25:32] given and the Mysteries here are watch
[1:25:35] this a mystery in
[1:25:38] scripture is a previously hidden
[1:25:43] truth now divinely
[1:25:46] revealed but which a supernatural
[1:25:49] element Still Remains despite the
[1:25:52] Revelation let me expound on that for a
[1:25:55] moment owning a Bible doesn't mean you
[1:25:58] catch everything that's revealed in the
[1:26:01] word otherwise everybody with the Bible
[1:26:04] that could read that had any kind of
[1:26:06] Common Sense would have to agree and
[1:26:09] understand the scriptures but it's a
[1:26:11] sealed
[1:26:12] book it's only to the
[1:26:16] elected would God do that purposely
[1:26:20] absolutely blind some to Open Eyes of
[1:26:23] others amen he reveal it to you who are
[1:26:27] you you ever had somebody tell you who
[1:26:30] do you think you are yeah you think
[1:26:33] you're holier than I am you think
[1:26:36] because you wear a long dress or this
[1:26:40] that or because you go to church and
[1:26:42] that that you're more holy than
[1:26:44] denominations they believe in
[1:26:49] Jesus haven't you ever had somebody say
[1:26:52] well what makes you so special
[1:26:54] special you got time for me to tell you
[1:26:57] how special I
[1:26:59] am I'm called
[1:27:02] predestinated elected chosen Justified
[1:27:06] glorified I've been anointed to receive
[1:27:09] this message I have been predestinated
[1:27:13] or
[1:27:14] ordained it was
[1:27:16] God that knew me before the foundation
[1:27:19] of the world and I didn't know nothing I
[1:27:21] came down here with spiritual Amnesia
[1:27:23] didn't know nothing
[1:27:25] long-haired Misfit but when God begin to
[1:27:28] open to me my eyes of understanding of
[1:27:32] this message everything came into a
[1:27:36] priority Rapture or
[1:27:40] bust no second
[1:27:43] place first place
[1:27:45] amen if you run run to gain the prize if
[1:27:49] you fight yeah fight to win
[1:27:55] not as one who just beats the air right
[1:28:02] huh thank having all the books and Tes
[1:28:06] doesn't mean you're going to catch the
[1:28:07] revelation of the
[1:28:10] hour you must have the Holy Spirit in
[1:28:12] your
[1:28:13] life let me tell how
[1:28:16] special Revelation is to
[1:28:21] you it is so special
[1:28:25] that God does not allow no preacher no
[1:28:28] Prophet no Pope no anyone else no Elder
[1:28:33] to give you
[1:28:35] Revelation they can preach they can
[1:28:37] expound on the word of God but God
[1:28:40] Alone Peter who do you say that I am
[1:28:44] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:28:46] Living
[1:28:48] God blessed art thou Simon Bor Jonah
[1:28:51] Flesh and Blood didn't give this to you
[1:28:54] but my Father which is in
[1:28:57] heaven and Upon This
[1:28:59] Rock
[1:29:03] Hallelujah
[1:29:08] am what makes the foolish
[1:29:11] foolish what makes a Wise
[1:29:15] Wise I cannot I think the thing that
[1:29:18] frustrates me the
[1:29:22] most is I really get down upon myself
[1:29:25] because I think if I preach it good
[1:29:28] enough the foolish will become
[1:29:32] wise so I'm
[1:29:35] thinking if I preach it good enough and
[1:29:39] with enough anointing and this and that
[1:29:42] that I will open their eyes I got
[1:29:45] nothing to do
[1:29:50] with foolish virgin will always be
[1:29:53] foolish that's right she's
[1:29:56] virgin she's going to be
[1:29:58] there she's going to be
[1:30:01] saved amen she's going to have eternal
[1:30:05] life she's going to be in heaven she's

[1:30:10] to be in the New
[1:30:12] Jerusalem they're going to be outside
[1:30:14] the
[1:30:15] gates thousands upon thousands of people
[1:30:20] they will have eternal life what why
[1:30:24] because they were born
[1:30:26] again they asked Christ to come into
[1:30:29] their life but there's very few that
[1:30:31] went on to adoption amen though he be
[1:30:34] born an heir to All
[1:30:38] Things there's an a time appointed of
[1:30:41] the
[1:30:43] father when God watches your

[1:34:58] known there are certain telltale signs
[1:35:00] that some people are good he he's got

[1:35:28] spiritual I don't care what it is if
[1:35:31] you're going to get better get around
[1:35:32] those that
[1:35:38] overcome amen
[1:35:43] amen all
[1:35:45] right all right I'm going to skip a few
[1:35:48] things here CU I just feel to to come to
[1:35:51] a point here 1 Peter 4 verse 17-8 the
[1:35:55] time is come the Judgment must begin at
[1:35:58] the house of God Amen yeah and if it
[1:36:02] first begins at
[1:36:04] us what shall the end be of them that
[1:36:08] obey not the gospel of God Amen and if
[1:36:12] the righteous scarcely be
[1:36:14] saved where shall the ungodly and The
[1:36:16] Sinner
[1:36:18] appear how many know that this is a
[1:36:20] house of
[1:36:22] judgment let me fast forward for just a
[1:36:25] second and tell you it's the only
[1:36:26] judgment the bride
[1:36:31] sees and it's self judgment right amen
[1:36:37] she judges
[1:36:40] herself because this is where judgment
[1:36:43] begins so when we come to church we
[1:36:46] don't come here to just be uh told hey
[1:36:49] you're predestinated you're elected uh
[1:36:52] no devil in hell can Hey listen let me
[1:36:54] tell you I don't know about you but I
[1:36:57] face a very Fierce
[1:37:00] adversary oh yes absolutely and if you
[1:37:04] think that every day and every time that
[1:37:07] you're going to uh uh you're going to
[1:37:09] see his tactics and you're never going
[1:37:12] to fall for any kind of a trick and
[1:37:14] you're never going to get blindsided you
[1:37:17] better wake up because there's a real
[1:37:19] devil and he's out there and in the
[1:37:22] sermon the contest brother R said you
[1:37:24] better study how he
[1:37:26] fights
[1:37:28] amen that's right amen because I you can
[1:37:32] tell the people as an
[1:37:34] example you can defeat him any time any
[1:37:38] place anywhere hallelujah amen I claim
[1:37:41] the token amen and everything like that
[1:37:44] then you go out here the next day and
[1:37:46] you ain't feeling so
[1:37:50] anointed and then you slip and fall then
[1:37:54] where you
[1:37:55] at cuz you going just by
[1:37:58] feelings listen I'm here to tell you God
[1:38:01] is weaning you away from feelings do you
[1:38:04] see it taste it smell it feel it hear it
[1:38:06] no yes amen Faith cometh by hearing but
[1:38:09] it's a greater ear than this because
[1:38:11] many have ears to hear and they hear not
[1:38:14] many have eyes to see but they see not
[1:38:17] but blessed are your ears blessed are
[1:38:20] your eyes why because the spirit is
[1:38:22] trying to bring something over to you so
[1:38:25] you can live a life that overcomes the
[1:38:29] enemy you will fa
[1:38:34] him absolutely you will face
[1:38:41] him in the
[1:38:42] sermon seven Church ages 54 judgment
[1:38:47] begins at the house of God by the word
[1:38:48] of God yeah amen not a textbook but the
[1:38:52] Bible yeah not some church teaches in
[1:38:54] their theology but what God says then
[1:38:58] you'll have a Revival where great powers
[1:39:00] and wonders and signs and miracles and
[1:39:02] everything else takes place see you put
[1:39:05] the word
[1:39:06] first not the signs the Wonders and
[1:39:09] because you jumped because you shouted
[1:39:11] because no that's what Pentecost did
[1:39:13] they put the emotion be before the word
[1:39:16] because if you listen to Pentecostal go
[1:39:19] back and listen to anything called
[1:39:22] Pentecostal
[1:39:24] and you will find out they're saying
[1:39:26] hallelujah right and they're getting the
[1:39:28] people all excited because of some
[1:39:32] anointing well the anointings will fool
[1:39:37] you and they leave
[1:39:39] you look at
[1:39:43] Elijah 450 false prophets he kills a
[1:39:46] mount
[1:39:48] caral then he runs towards Jezebel I'm
[1:39:52] going to tell her I'm going to preach to
[1:39:53] her sermon she going to
[1:39:55] repent he gets there before Jezebel
[1:39:58] tells him hey you know what happened the
[1:40:00] he false prophet cut their heads off and
[1:40:02] I tell you Jezebel you better because
[1:40:04] the Bible says he gave her a space to
[1:40:08] repent and she said I tell you what
[1:40:11] Elijah what you did to my prophets I'm
[1:40:14] going to do to
[1:40:16] you what did he
[1:40:21] do well I'm going to run run run run run
[1:40:26] being chased by
[1:40:28] Jezebel you got to be kidding me here's
[1:40:31] here's here's Rambo onean Army here's
[1:40:35] God's prophet and he's running before
[1:40:38] Jezebel and now he runs cuz brother Bram
[1:40:41] said watch when you're not under the
[1:40:44] anointing be
[1:40:48] careful how many of you know you have
[1:40:50] really good Services Hallelujah real
[1:40:52] good victories the next day or on your
[1:40:55] way home yeah yeah

[1:41:07] door something

[1:50:19] quiet before
[1:50:20] him I don't have to scream it out in
[1:50:23] fact my most precious prayers are when I

[1:50:28] and I can't hardly
[1:50:34] pray and I'm broken before
[1:50:37] God and I confess to him
[1:50:42] everything and he's never told nobody
[1:50:47] else Oh What A
[1:50:51] Savior God you talk about real love L's
[1:50:55] God loved you while you were yet a
[1:50:59] sinner but God commendeth his love
[1:51:03] toward us the first scripture I ever
[1:51:07] learned in my
[1:51:09] life Romans 5'8 but God commendeth his
[1:51:12] love toward us that while we were yet
[1:51:13] sinners Christ died for
[1:51:17] us I had to learn it at Green Oak Ranch
[1:51:19] Boy camp and everything the camp that
[1:51:23] you went to go do whether it's
[1:51:26] archery or all the activities you had to
[1:51:29] learn a scripture that was your ticket
[1:51:33] to get on the little train and I thought
[1:51:36] it so unfair I want to ride the train I
[1:51:38] want to memorize some
[1:51:40] scripture no just okay okay that's what
[1:51:44] it takes I want to ride the
[1:51:46] train and I you know you know like those
[1:51:49] fortune cookies got a little tiny piece
[1:51:51] of paper in it it said Romans 58 but God
[1:51:54] commendeth his love toward us while we
[1:51:56] were yet sinners Christ died for okay
[1:51:59] God commendeth we're in a world we use
[1:52:01] the word
[1:52:02] command never heard that word
[1:52:06] before so I memorizing it I got on the
[1:52:10] train I was one happy
[1:52:13] puppy little did I
[1:52:16] know it would start a foundation in my
[1:52:19] life amen that while I was yet a sinner
[1:52:22] Christ died for me listen when we boil
[1:52:25] this whole thing of Christianity down
[1:52:27] into a nutshell you know what it is Paul
[1:52:31] says is Christ and him crucified
[1:52:37] amen that's what it's all about He Paid
[1:52:40] a Debt he didn't owe thank you Lord I
[1:52:42] owed a debt I couldn't pay I never heard
[1:52:45] the gospel story before till I was 9
[1:52:48] years
[1:52:49] old I said Jesus Christ died for your
[1:52:52] sins I I didn't know I was a
[1:52:57] sinner and they had a guy that had an
[1:52:59] easel and he had these fluorescent
[1:53:02] chalks and this guy was a good artist
[1:53:05] and here was this big Chasm and here was
[1:53:09] here was Heaven and here was this Earth
[1:53:13] this Dimension and the only way you
[1:53:14] could get to heaven and he drew he drew
[1:53:17] a cross he said the only way that you'll
[1:53:20] get to heaven is through the cross
[1:53:24] and I said what is the
[1:53:26] cross I didn't know what do you mean the
[1:53:32] cross
[1:53:34] then they preached a sermon called the
[1:53:38] cross
[1:53:43] talk there was a man taken his name was
[1:53:46] Jesus Christ and he was bitten uh beaten
[1:53:51] and smitten
[1:53:53] he was
[1:53:54] bruised and they made him carry his
[1:53:59] cross up a hill called golgatha
[1:54:02] and
[1:54:04] there he was
[1:54:07] crucified never heard it
[1:54:09] before
[1:54:12] crucified he was crucified for what
[1:54:17] sin what did he do
[1:54:19] wrong Jesus said for what sin do you can

[2:00:46] Future 2 Corinthians
[2:00:48] 5:10 for we all must appear before the
[2:00:51] judgment seat of
[2:00:54] Christ this is Brother Brenan when he
[2:00:56] went beyond the curtain of time right
[2:00:59] when he was there and he said I want to
[2:01:00] see him he said he a little
[2:01:02] higher you can't see him until you're
[2:01:05] judged judged
[2:01:09] yeah does Paul have to be judged yeah
[2:01:13] and he said praise God because I've said
[2:01:16] only what Paul
[2:01:18] said amen so now watch what does this if
[2:01:22] you it is that everyone may receive the
[2:01:25] things done in his body according to
[2:01:28] that which he hath done whether it be
[2:01:30] good or bad
[2:01:38] yeah bride cannot have True Fellowship
[2:01:41] with those that are
[2:01:43] foolish Abraham could not have good
[2:01:46] fellowship with
[2:01:47] lot in fact there was always a
[2:01:49] contention
[2:01:53] Abraham had the wisdom of God enough to
[2:01:56] say okay
[2:01:59] lot you choose
[2:02:02] first
[2:02:04] amen you want to know God's
[2:02:07] will let a
[2:02:12] lukewarm half in half out
[2:02:16] Christian let them choose first well
[2:02:20] here's where I'd go then you know you go
[2:02:22] this
[2:02:26] way go ahead lot choose I want the green
[2:02:30] plains of
[2:02:33] Sodom Abraham said you go to the right
[2:02:36] I'll go to the
[2:02:38] left amen
[2:02:40] amen Abraham and
[2:02:43] lot had to get separated shuck had to be
[2:02:47] separated away from the
[2:02:49] wheat there comes a time in our life and
[2:02:52] I believe that God is doing this right
[2:02:54] now he's taking this little
[2:02:57] bride yes we pick up one here and one
[2:03:01] there but if you'll notice actually the
[2:03:04] crowd is getting thinn down a little
[2:03:08] bit where are those that were with us
[2:03:11] just a few years
[2:03:15] ago where'd they go what
[2:03:18] happened well this excuse that next
[2:03:21] thing you know well I don't put so much
[2:03:23] priority on church or this message the
[2:03:26] next thing you know a little bit of the
[2:03:27] world and everything what happened to
[2:03:29] Nathan and Kora Who challenged the
[2:03:32] authority of God's man in that day the
[2:03:35] Bible says that and the Earth opened its
[2:03:38] mouth and swallowed them
[2:03:41] up just watch these next thing you know
[2:03:44] the world Creeps
[2:03:46] in oh God help us to be like Abraham
[2:03:51] amen amen judge ourselves Lord is my
[2:03:55] life getting closer to God can I see
[2:03:59] it I spoke with a young man just the
[2:04:01] other day and we were visiting he said
[2:04:03] brother Ron you know what you were
[2:04:04] saying that we need to pray and read our
[2:04:06] Bible and he said you know what I
[2:04:08] started doing that and he says wow it's
[2:04:11] been a couple years now and you know
[2:04:13] what I pray and read my Bible every
[2:04:16] day and he said but why is
[2:04:19] it that I don't feel
[2:04:22] [Music]
[2:04:24] like I want to
[2:04:27] feel I said that it's pretty good I said
[2:04:30] cuz you're in a
[2:04:32] battle and God is weaning you away from
[2:04:34] feelings so say what kind of feeling do
[2:04:37] you
[2:04:38] want you want a bubble dance you want to
[2:04:41] get so excited you can say I got it well
[2:04:44] you can do it and and get so excited I'm
[2:04:48] nothing wrong with
[2:04:50] that but when you get done how was your
[2:04:53] walk with
[2:04:59] God amen
[2:05:03] amen I love the U meetings that we
[2:05:08] had I love the types and the Shadows
[2:05:11] when you look at the kinsman
[2:05:14] redeemer I love the story of
[2:05:18] Boaz because it shows the right of
[2:05:22] Redemption Now understand after the
[2:05:26] three died immc Maan and chilon when
[2:05:29] they all three died here's left
[2:05:33] widows they' got no
[2:05:36] seed so Naomi says okay orpa you go back
[2:05:41] Naomi you go ahead and go back too or
[2:05:45] Ruth orpa kissed her mother-in-law
[2:05:48] goodbye and adios
[2:05:52] and Ruth said
[2:05:54] no where you
[2:05:57] go I go that's right amen and your
[2:06:01] God will be my God and your people now
[2:06:05] what she's doing I want you to she's
[2:06:08] identifying under the Covenant that was
[2:06:11] given to IM
[2:06:15] LIC and Naomi is a recipient because she
[2:06:19] was United with you with a
[2:06:23] liate do you got that cuz the right of
[2:06:26] redemption comes through the man yes so
[2:06:29] here aimc she
[2:06:33] here she's over here in a foreign
[2:06:38] country she says I'm going back she's
[2:06:40] got
[2:06:41] enough spiritual perception I'm going
[2:06:44] back yes and when she does she she goes
[2:06:48] to the hometown of ALC and she finds a
[2:06:53] Kinsman by the name of Boaz who is of
[2:06:56] the family of
[2:06:59] IMC it's a nearer
[2:07:02] Kinsman oh and when these brothers begin
[2:07:05] to go into this and the Seven sealed
[2:07:08] book of redemption let me tell you the
[2:07:10] reason I get
[2:07:13] excited and the reason I've got a sermon
[2:07:15] to preach is I've been eating the book
[2:07:18] yeah I got something to preach when I
[2:07:21] eat the book book when I re when the
[2:07:23] word of God is revealed to me and the
[2:07:25] seals are open guess what it becomes a
[2:07:27] new book amen Lord amen otherwise I got
[2:07:31] nothing to
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:39] preach such as I have give I Thee Paul
[2:07:43] said I certify to you Brethren that that
[2:07:45] which you have heard of me I didn't
[2:07:47] receive it of man neither was I given of
[2:07:49] a man but by revelation of the Holy
[2:07:52] Ghost thank you
[2:07:54] Lord
[2:07:56] amen wisdom versus
[2:07:59] faith
[2:08:01] faith not wisdom
[2:08:04] not knowledge that comes from going to
[2:08:07] church and learning this
[2:08:09] message on he even said
[2:08:13] that after I'm gone he said you watch
[2:08:16] there'll be different ones raised up
[2:08:18] among you he said the devil will shoot
[2:08:21] him full of all kinds of
[2:08:24] poison a word to the
[2:08:26] church and he said you watch then he
[2:08:28] shoots him full of poison they said this
[2:08:30] one and a prophet meant this and he made
[2:08:32] a mistake over here and next thing you
[2:08:34] know your minds are all clouded no
[2:08:37] wonder people huh no
[2:08:40] Revelation come

[2:12:40] puzzle and I love
[2:12:43] it I love this
[2:12:45] message because I love
[2:12:48] Christ I do

[2:12:56] don't want to water it down just tell me
[2:13:00] the
[2:13:02] truth I remember my former Pastor his
[2:13:07] mom and dad were some of the ones in the
[2:13:09] Pentecostal movement that got brother
[2:13:11] Brandon to come to Los
[2:13:13] Angeles and I'd never met my pastor's
[2:13:16] mother before never met her and so I
[2:13:19] figured that when she come to Church she
[2:13:21] would be just a little Meek gray-haired
[2:13:23] little old sister come in and you know
[2:13:27] dressed as a grandmother well I remember
[2:13:30] my pastor said well my my mother's here
[2:13:33] today and we were in the church and she
[2:13:36] was standing right behind us you
[2:13:38] remember that say she standing just a
[2:13:39] couple pees behind us and Mom want you
[2:13:42] to stand up tell the people you you know
[2:13:44] like this so man she stood up and we
[2:13:47] turned around we looked and I was
[2:13:49] shocked
[2:13:51] my all of these bracelets and they all
[2:13:55] jingle down praise the Lord God BL and
[2:14:00] I'm not judging I'm just look I just
[2:14:02] thought I'd see a gray-haired
[2:14:04] old
[2:14:07] motherly and I
[2:14:10] remember I preached one time and
[2:14:13] Flagstaff and she was
[2:14:15] there and one of the deacons says uh
[2:14:19] sister Patterson wants excuse me but
[2:14:21] sister Patterson wants to see you she
[2:14:24] wants to see you right
