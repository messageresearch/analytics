[32:50] I have wrestled in the
[32:53] darkness oh this lonely Pilgrim land
[32:58] raising strong and mighty
[33:02] fortresses that I alone
[33:05] command and these castles I've
[33:09] constructed with the strength of my own
[33:12] hands are just
[33:15] temporary kingdoms on foundations made
[33:19] of
[33:20] sad in the middle of the
[33:24] battle I believe I finally B I'll never
[33:29] know the thrill of victory till I'm
[33:33] willing to lay
[33:36] down all my weapons of defense and

[33:46] arms and running helplessly to

[34:34] ambition is the treasure I'll
[34:38] obtain if I measure my
[34:42] successes on a scale of Earthly
[34:46] gain if the focus of my vision is the
[34:51] status I'll
[34:53] attain my accomplishments are worthless
[34:57] and my efforts are in
[35:01] vain so I lay aside these
[35:04] trophies to pursue a higher
[35:08] crown and should you choose somehow to
[35:11] use the life I willingly lay
[35:16] down I surrender all the Triumph for

[1:01:47] verses uh let me see here quickly verse
[1:01:51] 6 Jeremiah 32 and: 6
[1:01:56] the Bible says and Jeremiah said the
[1:01:58] word of the Lord came unto me saying
[1:02:02] behold hanil the son of Shalom thine
[1:02:06] uncles th thine Uncle shall come unto
[1:02:08] thee saying bu thee my field that is in
[1:02:11] anth for the right of redemption is in
[1:02:14] thy hand to buy it and so Hil my uncle's
[1:02:18] son came to me in the court of the
[1:02:19] prison according to the word of the Lord
[1:02:22] and said unto me by my field I pray thee
[1:02:25] that that is in anod which is in the
[1:02:27] country of Benjamin for the right of
[1:02:30] inheritance is thine and the Redemption
[1:02:32] is thine buy it for thyself then I knew
[1:02:37] that this was the word of the Lord yeah
[1:02:39] and I bought the field of haam Anil my
[1:02:42] uncle's son that was in anot and weighed
[1:02:45] him the money even 17 shekels of silver
[1:02:49] 17 is always the number of a system
[1:02:52] change something always happens silver
[1:02:55] speak speaks of
[1:02:56] redemption and I subscribed the evidence
[1:02:59] and sealed it and took Witnesses and
[1:03:02] weighed him the money in the balances
[1:03:05] and so I took the evidence of the
[1:03:07] purchase both that which was sealed
[1:03:09] according to the law and custom take
[1:03:11] note and that which was
[1:03:14] open and I gave the evidence of the
[1:03:17] purchase unto Barak the son of narah the
[1:03:20] son of messiah in the sight of Hamil my
[1:03:23] uncle's son in the presence of of the
[1:03:26] witnesses that subscribed the book of
[1:03:28] the purchase before all the Jews that
[1:03:31] sat in the court of the prison and I
[1:03:34] charged Barack before them saying look
[1:03:37] at how he changed now this is no longer
[1:03:38] custom this is now going into prophecy
[1:03:41] thus sayth the Lord of hosts the god of
[1:03:43] Israel take these
[1:03:46] evidences this evidence of the purchase
[1:03:49] both which is sealed and this evidence
[1:03:52] which is open put them in an earn vessel
[1:03:56] and make and and that it may continue
[1:03:58] many days for thus say the Lord of hosts
[1:04:02] the god of Israel houses and Fields and
[1:04:05] Vineyards shall be possessed in this
[1:04:08] land again may the Lord add a blessing
[1:04:11] to the reading of his word let's bow our

[1:05:20] semi-automatic and then we'll we'll
[1:05:21] change weapons as we go
[1:05:24] along
[1:05:26] so I I I'd like to just
[1:05:30] uh take a quotation tonight if you will
[1:05:32] allow me to do
[1:05:34] that Gabriel Gabriel's instruction to
[1:05:38] Daniel and I want you to see how brother
[1:05:42] renam puts this and he takes exactly
[1:05:46] Jeremiah 32 and: 6 and he says his
[1:05:50] cousin
[1:05:51] hail was left him some hair and they
[1:05:55] were going into
[1:05:57] captivity which we're going into with
[1:06:00] him this morning captivity and it was
[1:06:03] kept in an Earthly vessel look how
[1:06:05] brother bam puts it it was kept in an
[1:06:07] Earthly vessel is that shows where the
[1:06:11] power of God the Scrolls and the secrets
[1:06:15] of God is known in the heart but then
[1:06:19] the prophet goes further he says our
[1:06:21] Plan of Redemption the same being kept
[1:06:24] in Earthly
[1:06:26] vels starts off singular now he goes to
[1:06:30] plural Jesus's name and the
[1:06:33] Revelation now you might look at that
[1:06:35] quotation and you might just browse over
[1:06:37] it quickly but I I think brother Benham
[1:06:40] left us a real clue there tonight that
[1:06:43] we can look at this same evidences in
[1:06:46] the Earthly vessels so if you allow me
[1:06:49] to speak tonight I'd like to speak on
[1:06:51] the mystery of the open and the sealed
[1:06:54] evidence The Mystery of the open and the
[1:06:59] sealed evidence tonight now brother B
[1:07:02] says in the message job he says now
[1:07:05] Redemption he says God has a way of
[1:07:08] redemption and he says redeem means to
[1:07:10] be brought back to the right place or
[1:07:13] the right position now if I throw this
[1:07:16] cloth down on the floor and take another
[1:07:18] cloth from the chair that would be
[1:07:21] replacement yeah is that right and not
[1:07:23] Redemption right but to redeem Dre is to
[1:07:26] pick up that same cloth and put it back
[1:07:29] on the table that means there is no
[1:07:32] replacement for a Son of God Amen
[1:07:35] there's nobody that can take my place
[1:07:37] tonight oh that should already just give
[1:07:40] you such a such a peace that there's
[1:07:43] nobody that can take my chair tonight
[1:07:46] that chair that I'm sitting on tonight
[1:07:48] had my name on it before the world even
[1:07:52] began before it was even manufactured
[1:07:56] my name was written on that chair and so
[1:07:58] there's no replacement for me tonight
[1:08:02] can we say praise the
[1:08:03] Lord so when we look at Joseph how that
[1:08:08] Joseph we call him the dreamer the Bible
[1:08:10] calls him the dreamer his brothers
[1:08:12] called him the dreamer but Joseph only
[1:08:15] had two
[1:08:17] dreams only two
[1:08:19] dreams and that two dreams is really
[1:08:21] just one dream just different
[1:08:24] descriptions of of what God was going to
[1:08:26] do in the life of Joseph but I believe
[1:08:28] that we should look always at scripture
[1:08:31] and look at our portion in that
[1:08:34] scripture we should look at our part
[1:08:36] It's good to anoint you know and see
[1:08:38] brother brenham's part but you have a
[1:08:40] part too because if there was no you
[1:08:43] there was no need to send Elijah the
[1:08:44] prophet but because there was you God
[1:08:48] had to send Elijah the
[1:08:50] prophet can we say Amen so Joseph had
[1:08:54] these two dreams and he said the first
[1:08:56] dream was he said I saw amen we were
[1:08:58] binding sheath in the field he says and
[1:09:01] I saw my sheath look at the Bible
[1:09:03] language
[1:09:04] arose I saw my sheath
[1:09:08] arose he said and I saw the other Sheep
[1:09:11] amen doing obeisance to my sheath right
[1:09:15] amen and his brothers hated him for that
[1:09:17] dream then he had a second dream and the
[1:09:19] dream was he said I saw the sun the moon
[1:09:21] and the stars doing obeisance to me
[1:09:26] and his father said to him Joseph what
[1:09:28] type of a dream is this do you think
[1:09:30] that me your mother your brothers are
[1:09:31] all going to bow down to you oh my and
[1:09:33] his father observed that dream and I
[1:09:36] think we should observe that too because
[1:09:39] it's not only dealing with Israel
[1:09:41] natural but God is showing a mystery
[1:09:44] that he saw amen his family in the field
[1:09:47] and the same family he saw in the
[1:09:50] heavens God is going to take us from the
[1:09:53] field into the heavens the same family
[1:09:57] in the Earth is going to be changed in a
[1:09:59] moment in a twinkling of an eye and that
[1:10:02] family is going to put on the
[1:10:06] immortality hallelujah it's called
[1:10:09] Redemption it's called a way of
[1:10:11] redemption God has a plan of redemption
[1:10:14] tonight and let me tell you God is not
[1:10:16] going to
[1:10:18] fail I said God is not going to fail
[1:10:21] governments can fail we can fail
[1:10:23] hallelujah amen but God cannot fail
[1:10:26] that's one thing he cannot do he cannot
[1:10:30] fail and God cannot lose you tonight if
[1:10:33] he loses you he loses his
[1:10:36] thoughts that's right and God cannot
[1:10:39] lose his thoughts because you are part
[1:10:41] of him amen praise be to God so let's
[1:10:45] look at this quickly for a for a minute
[1:10:48] here as we look at Jeremiah in captivity
[1:10:52] now Jeremiah was shut up in prison
[1:10:55] because of his
[1:10:56] prophecy amen Israel didn't accept the
[1:11:00] prophecy of Elijah of Jeremiah and so
[1:11:03] they've taken him to prison yet Jeremiah
[1:11:05] said that you're going to be Amen in
[1:11:08] captivity for seven decades but God said
[1:11:12] there will be a
[1:11:13] restoration houses and Vineyards and
[1:11:16] Fields will be possessed again you see
[1:11:19] that's the way God works sometimes he'll
[1:11:22] allow us and he'll give us a little
[1:11:24] chastisement or little trial or whatever
[1:11:26] he'll allow us to get away he'll allow
[1:11:29] things to happen but with a promise of
[1:11:32] restoration hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:11:36] the God that I serve tonight he's the
[1:11:39] god of restoration he's the god that
[1:11:41] makes a way when there seems to be no
[1:11:44] way he will make a way in the time of
[1:11:47] trouble praise His holy name so here
[1:11:50] he's in prison and as he sits there the
[1:11:54] Lord says to him thus say the Lord he
[1:11:56] says your uncle's son is going to bring
[1:11:58] come to you and sell your person of land
[1:12:01] he says because you have the right of

[1:12:41] take away he can let you be scorned he
[1:12:44] can let you be mocked but there's one
[1:12:45] thing he cannot take away is that

[1:13:54] Hallelujah ohjah that feels good tonight
[1:13:58] to know that even if the devil puts us
[1:13:59] in a certain trial or a certain
[1:14:02] situation there's something he can't
[1:14:04] take away is your right to your
[1:14:07] inheritance Hallelujah and notice
[1:14:10] Jeremiah's fight didn't come from
[1:14:12] without it came from within that's where
[1:14:15] most of your trouble is going to come
[1:14:17] from it's going to come from within your
[1:14:20] fight is not going to come from from
[1:14:22] Africa your fight is not going to come
[1:14:24] from somewhere your fight is going to
[1:14:26] come from those that is around you amen
[1:14:28] that's where our fight starts but praise
[1:14:31] be to God it's a good fight of
[1:14:34] Faith because he promised never to leave
[1:14:36] us he promised never to forsake us
[1:14:39] hallah he promised to be in us right
[1:14:42] until the end of time Hallelujah now
[1:14:46] they tried to discredit Jeremiah I'm
[1:14:48] just laying a foundation they tried to
[1:14:50] discredit Jeremiah's message because
[1:14:53] they were think think is going to
[1:14:55] influence too many people but you know
[1:14:58] what once Jeremiah spoke that word could
[1:15:01] not return
[1:15:03] void because when a prophet
[1:15:06] speaks amen and God gives a word for
[1:15:08] that day and God gives a word for that
[1:15:11] age nobody can stop that no devil can
[1:15:15] stop whatever God has spoken let me tell
[1:15:18] you Satan has got experience and he's
[1:15:20] got an experience that when God speaks
[1:15:23] it will not return unto him void but it
[1:15:25] shall accomplish the purpose it sent
[1:15:28] forth to do so when God said let there
[1:15:30] be light the devil was there he saw the
[1:15:32] light coming into existence when God
[1:15:34] said that Noah's going to build an ark
[1:15:36] and the Ark will not be drowned amen
[1:15:38] Satan was there to see it
[1:15:41] happen the devil has got experience but
[1:15:43] his experience is that whatever God
[1:15:46] speaks it's going to happen and God says
[1:15:49] there will be a bride
[1:15:52] tonight without spot without
[1:15:56] wrinkle there will be a church amen it
[1:15:59] depends on how you look at yourself
[1:16:01] tonight and I want you to anoint your
[1:16:03] faith amen and look at amen what you are
[1:16:06] and so that you can have confidence in
[1:16:08] where you are going to
[1:16:10] tonight once you can see where you come
[1:16:12] from then you can have confidence in
[1:16:15] where you are going to praise his mighty
[1:16:18] name oh Hallelujah the devil cannot
[1:16:20] strip you from your rights amen they can
[1:16:24] take jerem put him on a YouTube channel
[1:16:27] they can take Jeremiah and put him on
[1:16:29] some YouTube prison but let me tell you
[1:16:31] whatever Jeremiah spoken you cannot
[1:16:33] reverse that Hallelujah no matter what
[1:16:36] you tried to do to Jeremiah the word has
[1:16:38] already left the mouth of the
[1:16:40] [Applause]
[1:16:42] Prophet hallelujah amen because it's
[1:16:46] spoken praise be to God now brother B
[1:16:50] says never in the world was God's
[1:16:52] messenger ever received by the
[1:16:54] Ecclesiastes
[1:16:55] never they won't receive God's prophets
[1:17:00] you know why because they have to
[1:17:01] brother uses the term they have to stay
[1:17:04] true to form how they've been taught
[1:17:07] what the church says what the bishop
[1:17:09] says what what what the system says and
[1:17:12] they'll go against what God saids
[1:17:14] because they don't want to recognize
[1:17:16] God's Prophet for the hour but let me
[1:17:18] tell you friends we didn't come to be
[1:17:20] seen or to be heard God's Prophet don't
[1:17:22] come Hallelujah to to to have some
[1:17:25] people worship him not for one minute do
[1:17:27] I bring any attention to myself the
[1:17:29] prophet says but I've come to establish
[1:17:32] a relationship between men and
[1:17:35] [Applause]
[1:17:37] gods can we say Amen never in the world
[1:17:40] was God's messenger ever received by the
[1:17:43] Ecclesiastes you think they received
[1:17:45] Elijah in the Old Testament they never
[1:17:48] received him friends you know why they
[1:17:49] never received Elijah it's because
[1:17:51] Elijah said I'm going to close the
[1:17:53] heavens and the Earth for 3 years and he
[1:17:56] closed it up and they thought Ah that's
[1:17:58] just a little prophecy they never took
[1:17:59] Elijah serious because he just closed up
[1:18:02] the Heavens what else can he do amen
[1:18:04] they never saw that this was God's
[1:18:06] Prophet for the hour because he only
[1:18:08] shut the heavens that's all he did but
[1:18:11] then God said to him go to I've opened
[1:18:14] up another door for you there is a wiow
[1:18:16] woman in zapet whom I have commanded you
[1:18:20] see friends that's the unwritten amen I
[1:18:22] don't read where God has ever spoken to
[1:18:24] this woman but go God says I've already
[1:18:27] commanded her to take care of you you
[1:18:29] see God works on both
[1:18:33] ends Hallelujah and when Elijah came to
[1:18:37] her he said to her I'll fix me I don't
[1:18:38] know why I'm going into this but he said
[1:18:40] to her fix me something to eat she says
[1:18:42] sir I'm only I've only got a little meal
[1:18:45] and a little oil and I'm going to make
[1:18:46] something for my son and I and we're
[1:18:48] going to die but this is going to be the
[1:18:49] last
[1:18:52] supper it's going to be the last supper
[1:18:55] I'm just going to eat and die after this
[1:18:57] he says well Bak for me first and the
[1:19:00] Bible says a she went he said thus sayth
[1:19:03] the Lord th Cruise will not run dry amen
[1:19:07] but there will be meal and there will be
[1:19:09] oil in your house and brother as she
[1:19:11] went into the house she started pouring
[1:19:12] out but there's oil there's meal there's
[1:19:15] enough to be
[1:19:16] sustained why she had something to
[1:19:19] accept what God's Prophet
[1:19:21] [Applause]
[1:19:23] said
[1:19:25] I read the scripture I don't read her
[1:19:28] repenting while the meal and the oil was
[1:19:31] multiplied I don't read her saying I'm
[1:19:33] now in the message God has sent me a
[1:19:36] prophet I don't read that with the signs
[1:19:39] and with the Wonders and with the
[1:19:41] miracle in a kitchen I don't read her
[1:19:43] saying God sent a prophet but then God
[1:19:45] allowed her son to die and now she says
[1:19:50] listen have you come to re to to to
[1:19:52] remind me of my sins then the sunay
[1:19:55] and Elijah says I don't know because God
[1:19:57] don't reveal Everything To His prophets
[1:20:00] and Elijah says give him to me he takes
[1:20:03] the boy he goes up to the lift listen
[1:20:06] here a little room in the
[1:20:08] house a little square box room in the
[1:20:11] house and he takes the boy he gives no
[1:20:15] explanation she asks no questions that's
[1:20:18] how you should be in the message you
[1:20:20] don't need explanation you don't need
[1:20:22] Hallelujah to be questioning all you
[1:20:24] have to do is believe that whatever
[1:20:26] happens in that little room is going to
[1:20:29] be third P
[1:20:32] power hallelujah hallelujah are you
[1:20:34] ready tonight and he went up into the
[1:20:37] room and when he came back he prayed for
[1:20:39] the boy three times and when he came
[1:20:42] back now she had something to bring a
[1:20:44] Revival to her now she said now I know
[1:20:46] that you are a prophet of God what signs
[1:20:49] and wonders and the Miracles in the
[1:20:50] kitchen she didn't have that but when
[1:20:52] the quickening power came when when the
[1:20:54] third pool power came now she said now I
[1:20:57] know you see once you come in contact
[1:20:59] with that third pool power once the word
[1:21:01] is being revealed to you once the
[1:21:03] message is open to you nobody can take
[1:21:06] it away from
[1:21:07] you yes
[1:21:10] amen I hope you hear me well tonight
[1:21:13] amen I said to brother on somebody said
[1:21:15] back home once you see the message if
[1:21:17] I'm a witness and I've seen an accident
[1:21:19] and I've seen something happen nobody
[1:21:21] can tell me I did not see amen amen you
[1:21:24] might have your opinion you might have
[1:21:26] your own thing but I can tell you what
[1:21:27] I've witnessed and once you see the
[1:21:30] message nobody can let you unsee the
[1:21:32] message so if you leave and say this is
[1:21:35] not the message that means you've never
[1:21:36] seen
[1:21:40] it because you cannot unsee what you've
[1:21:44] seen that's
[1:21:46] right praise be to God I'm ready to
[1:21:50] preach tonight I'm warming
[1:21:53] up Hallelujah now this woman has a
[1:21:56] Revival now she says I know that you're
[1:21:58] a prophet she never said that with the
[1:22:00] meal and the oil you see while she was
[1:22:02] being fed while she was just being fed
[1:22:04] in the house she didn't say those things
[1:22:06] but now she's saying when she sees
[1:22:08] resurrection power when she sees the
[1:22:10] third pool manifestation when you see
[1:22:13] all these things are happening now she's
[1:22:14] say I know that you are a
[1:22:17] prophet because in the next chapter is
[1:22:19] the Mount carel Showdown yeah and in the
[1:22:22] mount Carl Showdown Elijah's asking how
[1:22:25] long will you be Hal between two
[1:22:27] opinions and in Elijah's prayer he says
[1:22:31] father let this people know that you are
[1:22:34] God and that I am their
[1:22:36] Prophet That's The Showdown friends to
[1:22:40] know that that's our Lord out there and
[1:22:43] that he has sent a prophet that's the
[1:22:45] showdown in this
[1:22:49] hour oh are you ready for that tonight
[1:22:52] Hallelujah brother M says you can kill
[1:22:54] the messenger but you can never kill his
[1:23:00] message thank I said you can kill the
[1:23:03] messenger but you can never kill the
[1:23:06] message brother man says though Steven
[1:23:08] was killed and he was seen at the right
[1:23:10] hand of the father he said his message
[1:23:12] still lingered on I like the way the
[1:23:14] prophet puts it he said Steven's message
[1:23:16] still lingered on because Paul spoke
[1:23:18] about
[1:23:19] it are you hearing me tonight friends
[1:23:23] our Prophet might could be here but the
[1:23:25] message is still lingering on we still
[1:23:27] speaking about it he's been off the
[1:23:30] scene for so many years but we are still
[1:23:32] speaking about it you know why because
[1:23:34] the message is eternal
[1:23:37] [Applause]
[1:23:39] life it comes from the Eternal one it's
[1:23:43] like I said many people can pick up this
[1:23:45] word this is Rema word yeah this is Rema
[1:23:49] it's written spoken right but
[1:23:53] logos is the thoughts behind the Rema so
[1:23:57] a lot of people can have the Rema word
[1:23:59] they can preach denomination have the
[1:24:00] Rema word every denomination can have
[1:24:04] Rema word but not everybody can have
[1:24:07] logos because logos is the mind of God
[1:24:10] and that's why you needed a prophet to
[1:24:12] say good morning friends I'm here this
[1:24:15] morning to tell you what was in the mind
[1:24:17] of God here's the Locos coming the
[1:24:20] thoughts behind the
[1:24:23] words
[1:24:25] are you ready amen amen you can kill the
[1:24:28] messenger but you cannot kill his
[1:24:30] message amen I think these people are a
[1:24:33] bit too late they think they've put uh
[1:24:35] Jeremiah on a YouTube jail a YouTube
[1:24:39] prison and and a internet prison and put
[1:24:42] him up there and put him on display hey
[1:24:44] Jeremiah Jeremiah says you can do
[1:24:46] whatever you want to this body but what
[1:24:48] left my mouth is is the words that I
[1:24:50] speak they are spirit and they are life
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:55] Hallelujah are you ready tonight so I
[1:24:59] want you to see this quickly because
[1:25:00] it's important that before Hil could
[1:25:03] come to
[1:25:04] Jeremiah well let me go back I I feel
[1:25:07] the pull on that Elijah let me stop
[1:25:08] quickly there and Elijah said to them
[1:25:11] let's go up on Mount carel let's call
[1:25:14] upon God for how long will it be halt
[1:25:16] between two opinions and they came up to
[1:25:19] Amen brother even ever proud and they
[1:25:22] called 450 Bale prophets called upon
[1:25:25] their gods now you see the reason why
[1:25:27] their God could not come because there
[1:25:29] was actually
[1:25:32] none did you hear what I said tonight
[1:25:35] and the reason why there was no fire is
[1:25:38] because these Bale prophets they used to
[1:25:40] make artificial fire and let the
[1:25:42] worshippers come in and they would bring
[1:25:44] the fire and oh it would be up in the in
[1:25:46] the idol and they would say oh pale
[1:25:49] Answers by fire B so Elijah challenged
[1:25:51] them by what they were deceived with
[1:25:55] and so on this day he says now bring
[1:25:57] your fire bring your God and the Bible
[1:26:00] says they cried they cried the whole day
[1:26:02] and there was no voice you see the
[1:26:04] church nominal there's no voice
[1:26:06] friends but in the days of the voice of
[1:26:09] the Seven Angels when he begins to sound
[1:26:13] the mystery of God should be finished we
[1:26:16] have a voice and we have a scriptural
[1:26:20] voice with a scriptural sign too
[1:26:24] hallelujah oh friends and before Elijah
[1:26:28] uh he he took he took 12 Stones and when
[1:26:32] he took those 12 Stones he pecked them
[1:26:34] remember he he never he never built a
[1:26:37] new altar it was the very altar
[1:26:42] restored because it's the hour of
[1:26:44] restoration so he took 12 Stones which
[1:26:47] represent the 12 tribes of Israel so he
[1:26:49] took up those 12 Stones he picked up
[1:26:52] those stones and he called upon the Lord
[1:26:54] and he says father let them know this
[1:26:56] day that you are God and that I am his
[1:26:58] Prophet God had to answer by fire oh
[1:27:02] friends Hallelujah God came right down
[1:27:05] and licked up the water amen consumed
[1:27:08] the sacrifice and even in the trenches
[1:27:10] that's the God that I serve because we
[1:27:13] don't have a painted
[1:27:16] fire our services are not painted
[1:27:19] Services we don't have to make you and
[1:27:21] whoop you up tonight Hallelujah you see
[1:27:24] you'll only get that from a
[1:27:27] prostitute because you cannot be a
[1:27:29] prostitute and a virgin at the same time
[1:27:32] a prostitute will give you service and
[1:27:34] after that she'll ask you for money but
[1:27:36] not a
[1:27:38] virgin so the mother harot and her
[1:27:40] daughters will give service and then
[1:27:43] they'll push their hand out and says now
[1:27:44] give us the money s a
[1:27:46] seed not in the message of the hour oh
[1:27:50] friend the seed is not money the seed is
[1:27:52] the
[1:27:53] words
[1:27:54] amen can we say Amen tonight Hallelujah
[1:27:58] I began to look at that brother Ron
[1:28:00] Elijah had 12 Stones and he pck those 12
[1:28:02] Stones went to the Book of Matthew I
[1:28:05] found out the Lord Jesus Took the fish
[1:28:07] and the bread he broke the bread
[1:28:08] multiplied the bread and when they were
[1:28:10] done they picked up 12 baskets of
[1:28:12] fragments full of baskets 12 baskets
[1:28:16] full of fragments but then if you go
[1:28:18] further into the Book of Mark there is
[1:28:20] seven baskets left in one place there's
[1:28:23] 12 12 in the other place there seven the
[1:28:27] 12 is for the 12 tribes of Israel but
[1:28:30] the seven that's for us because we had a
[1:28:32] Ministry of Elijah he can't take the 12
[1:28:35] Stones he has to take up seven stones
[1:28:38] and show us from Genesis to Revelation
[1:28:42] and bring amen proper worship back to
[1:28:44] the church again for the father seeketh
[1:28:47] such that will worship Him in spirit and
[1:28:52] in truth tonight Hallelujah you see
[1:28:54] brother Brian amen did Elijah pick up 12
[1:28:56] Stones yes amen so our Elijah cannot
[1:28:59] pick up 12 because he's not sent to the
[1:29:00] Jews he's a gentile
[1:29:03] prophet he picked up seven baskets why
[1:29:07] did he pick up because he's here to tie
[1:29:08] up the Loose
[1:29:10] Ends fragments a little bit here and a
[1:29:13] little bit there here a little there
[1:29:15] precept upon precept line upon line hall
[1:29:19] we don't eat from 12 baskets we eat from
[1:29:21] Seven
[1:29:23] baskets for don't put things in the
[1:29:25] Bible for us just to read it friends it
[1:29:27] has
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:29] meaning if we have Elijah then we must
[1:29:32] have a
[1:29:33] restoration can we say Amen
[1:29:35] tonight Hallelujah I want you to see
[1:29:38] your Hill comes and haam says this land

[1:29:49] from me it has no value friends some
[1:29:52] people will be in the message and the
[1:29:54] message will have be no value to
[1:29:57] them some people will see the message
[1:30:00] and they look into it says this man
[1:30:01] calls me a
[1:30:05] vulture but when we read and we pick up
[1:30:07] the spoken word we about the same man oh

[1:51:10] deceiver robber he robs his own boss
[1:51:13] steals at
[1:51:16] work it's on the evidence friends that's
[1:51:19] exactly what Jacob did he stole from his
[1:51:21] boss
[1:51:27] right and then he had to run away again
[1:51:31] shame Jacob is running away again he's
[1:51:34] on the Run he's on the run and then he
[1:51:37] meets the
[1:51:40] angel I said he meets the
[1:51:42] Angel that's the seven seal friends is
[1:51:46] when the angel the descending Angel
[1:51:48] comes down then you must know that's the
[1:51:49] seven seal friends it's not between you
[1:51:52] and the angel alone and the scripture
[1:51:54] says in the book of Isaiah it says that
[1:51:56] Jacob had power over the angel now
[1:51:59] friends let me stop there you cannot
[1:52:01] have power over an angel right
[1:52:03] physically how you going to defeat an
[1:52:05] angel bro you think you can wrestle with
[1:52:08] the angel he'll blow you
[1:52:15] over you can't wrestle with the angel
[1:52:18] angel can destroy a whole city so when
[1:52:20] the scripture says he had power over the
[1:52:22] angel
[1:52:23] it's not physical power the power that
[1:52:26] he had was he reminded the angel of the
[1:52:31] promise he reminded the angel of the
[1:52:34] sealed
[1:52:35] evidence that you are the rightful
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:42] owner let's go further and the angel ask
[1:52:46] we know who that angel is right we know
[1:52:47] who that angel is it's Christ
[1:52:49] friends amen that's my Lord up
[1:52:53] there what's your
[1:52:56] name Jacob the angel knew his name but
[1:52:59] you see based on the open evidence his
[1:53:02] name was Jacob but you see according to
[1:53:06] the sealed evidence he must have a name
[1:53:12] change oh you're not catching what I'm
[1:53:14] saying tonight you see according to the
[1:53:16] open evidence his name is Jacob but in
[1:53:19] this document here his name is Israel
[1:53:23] so in that earn vessel Jacob there was a
[1:53:27] open evidence and a sealed evidence
[1:53:29] there was the Israel in
[1:53:34] [Applause]
[1:53:36] Jacob are you
[1:53:38] ready so the sealed evidence was
[1:53:41] Israel that's how God works amen this is
[1:53:46] how it works Hallelujah Jacob ran away
[1:53:51] now we're coming to Joseph
[1:53:53] and Joseph as we go along Joseph his
[1:53:55] brothers hates him he's got this dream
[1:53:58] and he's got this two dreams which is
[1:54:00] actually the same dream one dream really
[1:54:03] twice just different descriptions it's
[1:54:06] like a prophecy a virgin shall conceive
[1:54:10] but in the Book of Genesis it says the
[1:54:12] seed of the woman shall bruise the same
[1:54:14] thing just a further expression of the
[1:54:17] same
[1:54:18] prophecy so here we find out Joseph the
[1:54:21] brothers take him to put him in a pit
[1:54:23] and as they put him in a
[1:54:26] pit they put him in a pit brother and
[1:54:29] sister after three days they saw the
[1:54:32] midianites coming they sell him to the
[1:54:34] midianites and the one said no let's
[1:54:36] kill him no the other one said no let's
[1:54:37] not kill him because we don't want blood
[1:54:39] on his hands but you know what let's
[1:54:42] kill a kid let's kill a wild animal and
[1:54:44] let's kill it and let's take the coat
[1:54:47] and dip it in the blood and let's take
[1:54:50] the evidence to the father
[1:54:53] that the son has been killed so they
[1:54:55] sold him and here they take the coat of
[1:54:59] many colors not like mine mine doesn't
[1:55:02] have many
[1:55:03] colors they DP It in
[1:55:06] Blood and what happens now the coach
[1:55:11] goes back to the original
[1:55:12] owner and while the owner lifts up the
[1:55:16] coat the guilty boys are standing on the
[1:55:20] other side of the coat guilt has
[1:55:23] charged but the father could not see the
[1:55:27] guilt of their children the father could
[1:55:31] not see the guilty stains of his sons
[1:55:35] because the code the evidence was dipped
[1:55:37] in
[1:55:39] blood so the father had to look through
[1:55:42] that blood and when he looked through
[1:55:44] the blood he saw you spotless virtuous
[1:55:48] sinless bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:55:56] God kept it away from Jak from from
[1:55:59] Israel from J from Israel God kept it
[1:56:02] away from him Hallelujah God could have
[1:56:05] showed him if Jacob knew where his son
[1:56:07] was you think he'd be sitting there
[1:56:10] he'll go buy him back but you see Joseph
[1:56:12] was the sealed
[1:56:14] evidence amen Jacob was the vessel to
[1:56:17] bring restoration Joseph Joseph was the
[1:56:20] vessel to bring Redemption Jose was the
[1:56:22] vessel to store up the food Joseph was
[1:56:25] the vessel Hallelujah that's going to
[1:56:27] bring the mind of God for this
[1:56:29] generation oh
[1:56:32] friend
[1:56:34] Hallelujah so we were all
[1:56:38] guilty we were all guilty that's why I
[1:56:41] said that evidence had to go back to the
[1:56:45] father now friends when we look at this
[1:56:48] we were all trapped Satan had excess and
[1:56:53] sometimes like myself we we come from
[1:56:55] different Bloodlines I I I told you the
[1:56:57] last time I've got Greek in my blood I
[1:56:59] was born in
[1:57:01] apollis by birth mom got married to an
[1:57:05] Naidu and then same father same mother
[1:57:09] but then my name had to change from a
[1:57:11] polus to an IDU
[1:57:13] Indian if I had a choice I wouldn't take
[1:57:16] that
[1:57:17] name cuz I don't look like one maybe I
[1:57:19] do I don't
[1:57:20] know I certain don't walk like
[1:57:24] one certainly don't dress like one
[1:57:28] too so if I look at my birth our birth
[1:57:31] becomes more
[1:57:34] mysterious than the Virgin birth because
[1:57:37] God had to keep you and watch you for
[1:57:39] 6,000
[1:57:40] years because there was a word spoken in
[1:57:44] Genesis 1: 128 that was saying let
[1:57:48] replenish and multiply the earth now
[1:57:50] remember now the prophet says that
[1:57:52] scripture remained unfulfilled until
[1:57:55] Jesus was
[1:57:58] born it remained unfulfilled because
[1:58:00] that first Adam was supposed to bring
[1:58:02] forth the second Adam that's why he's
[1:58:03] called the last
[1:58:05] Adam and then he was supposed to bring
[1:58:07] us forth
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:10] amen hallelujah but you see because of
[1:58:13] these evidences we had to go through
[1:58:16] different test and different things and
[1:58:17] different problems in our lives but
[1:58:20] there's one thing that the or orig owner
[1:58:23] has your name written on it am
[1:58:26] Hallelujah and that is why brother and
[1:58:28] sister amen you have the right to every
[1:58:31] Redemptive blessing that is yours
[1:58:33] tonight you have the right to be healed
[1:58:37] Hallelujah you have right to Deliverance
[1:58:39] you have right to Joy you have right to
[1:58:41] peace you know why he died for all of
[1:58:43] those
[1:58:45] things praise His Wonderful Name
[1:58:48] Hallelujah the sealed evidence no man
[1:58:51] could touch it
[1:58:52] the sealed evident proves who's the
[1:58:55] rightful owner and I'm going to quickly
[1:58:58] just push it a little
[1:59:00] forward
[1:59:01] John the
[1:59:03] Revelator he was right there when they
[1:59:06] crucified
[1:59:08] Christ was right there he witnessed the
[1:59:10] whole thing but then he was caught up in
[1:59:14] a vision brother M says John caught up
[1:59:16] in the vision he says John was in the
[1:59:18] vision he says and then John saw the 20
[1:59:22] four Elders saw the fall living
[1:59:24] creatures and then there was a

[2:19:42] solution to the
[2:19:44] problem like I said the last time the
