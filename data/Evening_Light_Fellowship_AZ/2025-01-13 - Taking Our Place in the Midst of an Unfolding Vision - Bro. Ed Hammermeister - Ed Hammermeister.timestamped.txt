[54:52] verse
[54:53] 10 verse 10
[54:59] wherefore the rather rather Brethren
[55:01] give diligence to make your calling an
[55:03] election sure for if you do these things

[55:14] abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom
[55:18] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

[55:37] this Tabernacle to stir you up by
[55:40] putting you in remembrance drop down to
[55:44] verse 16 for we have not followed
[55:47] cunningly devised fables when we made
[55:50] known unto you the power and coming of
[55:53] our Lord Jesus Christ but were I
[55:56] Witnesses of his
[55:58] majesty for he received from God the
[56:01] Father honor and Glory when there came
[56:05] such a voice to him from the excellent
[56:08] Glory saying this is my beloved Son in
[56:12] whom I am well pleased and this voice
[56:16] which came from heaven we heard when we
[56:18] were with him in the Holy Mount now
[56:21] imagine this Peter saying I was there I
[56:23] heard that amen but then he says this we
[56:26] have also a more sure word of Prophecy
[56:31] where unto you do well that you take
[56:33] heed as unto a light that shineth in the
[56:38] dark place until the day Dawn and the
[56:42] day star arise in your hearts God bless
[56:46] his word you may have your seats this

[1:02:27] and the Lord answered me and said write
[1:02:29] the vision make it plain upon tables
[1:02:33] that he may run that readeth it now so

[1:02:45] vision is yet for an appointed time but

[1:03:14] little bit of time we all have a
[1:03:15] different way of approaching the word we
[1:03:18] had a a brother brother dea's son OED
[1:03:21] was in our congregation for a while and
[1:03:24] he ministered and we all called him the
[1:03:26] helicopter preacher cuz he just got in
[1:03:29] he got right into the word and when he
[1:03:30] was done he just closed up the Bible and
[1:03:32] I'm still making notes as he turned it
[1:03:34] to me and yeah we called him the
[1:03:35] helicopter preacher that's when I became
[1:03:38] known as the 747 preacher I need a
[1:03:40] little bit of a Runway to start so I'm
[1:03:43] I'm going to take a little bit of that
[1:03:44] Liberty this morning so just just bear
[1:03:46] with me turn with me to Revelations
[1:03:48] chapter
[1:03:50] 1 Revelations chap
[1:03:53] 1 and I will read just a few verses here
[1:03:56] as
[1:03:58] well the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:04:01] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:04:06] servants things which must shortly come
[1:04:11] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[1:04:16] his Angel unto his servant John this a
[1:04:20] tremendous thought about that angel that
[1:04:23] that spoke this to his servant John who
[1:04:25] bear record of the word of God and of
[1:04:27] the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[1:04:31] things that he saw blessed is he that
[1:04:34] readeth and they that hear the words of
[1:04:36] this prophecy and keep those things
[1:04:39] which are written therein for the time
[1:04:42] is at hand John to the seven churches
[1:04:45] which are in Asia Grace be unto you and
[1:04:48] peace now look at the words here from
[1:04:51] him which is and which was and which is
[1:04:56] to come and from the seven spirits which
[1:05:00] are before his throne so I'm I'm going
[1:05:04] to take that one more in in Revelations
[1:05:07] 19 and uh and we'll we'll take it the
[1:05:11] the Book of Revelations is an unfolding
[1:05:14] book right before our eyes and and
[1:05:16] there's never been a people never been a
[1:05:19] people on the Earth that can read it
[1:05:22] like we can read it that's right and and
[1:05:24] and and we thank God for this
[1:05:27] privilege verse 7 let us be glad and
[1:05:29] rejoice give honor to him for the
[1:05:31] marriage of the Lamb has come his wife
[1:05:34] has made herself ready to her was
[1:05:39] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:05:41] fine linen clean and white for the fine
[1:05:43] linen is the righteousness of saints and
[1:05:46] he said unto me write blessed are they
[1:05:50] which are called to the marriage supper
[1:05:53] of the Lamb you can be great grateful
[1:05:55] that you're saved but I think if you
[1:05:57] ever want to be grateful be grateful
[1:06:00] that you can be called a part of the
[1:06:02] Bride of Jesus Christ there is no
[1:06:04] greater privilege than to be in that
[1:06:07] position today and he said unto me these
[1:06:11] are the true sayings of
[1:06:15] God and now John says and I fell at his
[1:06:19] feet to worship him and he said see he
[1:06:22] said see thou do it not I am thy fellow
[1:06:25] servant and of the Brethren that have
[1:06:28] the testimony of Jesus worship God for
[1:06:33] the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[1:06:38] Prophecy now there's a lot to unpack
[1:06:42] there but let me let me just take take
[1:06:45] it as the Lord has given it to me this
[1:06:46] morning and I feel like I've got uh some
[1:06:50] things on my heart that I feel I'd like
[1:06:51] to get to but we'll just also be
[1:06:54] sensitive to how the Lord is leading in
[1:06:55] us this morning but if we take this
[1:06:58] thought of taking an unfolding vision
[1:07:01] and and taking our place you know a
[1:07:04] vision if if we would take it and we're
[1:07:06] acquainted through the message it is the
[1:07:09] picture it is the Insight you know in
[1:07:12] into the past it's a into the present
[1:07:15] and into the future it's also goes
[1:07:18] beyond what our natural eyes will see it
[1:07:22] it goes into other Realms and and we
[1:07:25] have have had an insight into another
[1:07:27] realm and another kingdoms and and other
[1:07:30] places like no other people on the Earth
[1:07:32] and and so we've been brought and the
[1:07:35] vision has been brought to us who are in
[1:07:38] this Dimension who are in this time who
[1:07:41] are in this season it's been brought to
[1:07:43] our senses to understand that that we
[1:07:47] can understand what's there but by no
[1:07:49] means are our senses what's going to
[1:07:52] bring us to where we need to go to
[1:07:54] that's right uh and and and and I i' say
[1:07:56] this we have five senses but those are
[1:07:59] only to contact this Earth our six sense
[1:08:03] is what's been given to contact a
[1:08:05] Heavenly realm and he says the six sense
[1:08:08] is superior to every other sense and
[1:08:12] when all the other five senses are lying
[1:08:15] take the six sense and I believe we
[1:08:17] ought to take that this morning our our
[1:08:19] minds are focused on something so a
[1:08:22] vision or a prophecy and you know we're
[1:08:25] on the heels of the Pentecostal Age and
[1:08:29] and sometimes everybody is a prophet and
[1:08:31] everybody's got a prophecy and but if we
[1:08:33] take the real if we take the genuine if
[1:08:35] we take the thinking that God has given
[1:08:38] us and and we view this not just as an
[1:08:41] inspiration like pulling something down
[1:08:43] but a but a prophecy or a vision it's
[1:08:45] something God wants to make known to us
[1:08:49] it's not us pulling it down it's God
[1:08:51] revealing it to him Us in this season
[1:08:54] and so we're thank thankful for it and
[1:08:57] uh all of these things are subject to
[1:08:59] the will of God and in in doing God a
[1:09:02] service brother brah said there's five
[1:09:03] things about the the word in the SE must
[1:09:06] be in season it must be at the time God
[1:09:09] said it would be and it must be written
[1:09:11] in the word of God and it must be in the
[1:09:14] season of God's time and it must be
[1:09:17] God's choosing he doesn't need any of us
[1:09:21] to interpret his word God is his own
[1:09:25] interpreter and he interprets his word
[1:09:28] by bringing it to pass so we want to
[1:09:31] take that this morning now I want to
[1:09:33] read uh this has always been precious to
[1:09:36] me but from the impersonation of
[1:09:38] Christianity and I believe I gave this
[1:09:40] quote brother bam would say and God
[1:09:44] likened the prophet to an eagle that
[1:09:47] would go in the makeup of a prophet he
[1:09:50] is a Seer that in the spirit he climbs
[1:09:54] Beyond the emotion of the church he goes
[1:09:58] beyond the rhythm of the music he goes
[1:10:02] beyond the Clapping of the hands he goes
[1:10:05] beyond the joy of the Saints now I love
[1:10:08] all of those things but there's
[1:10:10] something there's a kernel that goes so
[1:10:13] much deeper than this and he says he
[1:10:16] goes beyond all of that God brings him
[1:10:19] into a realm alone he opens his eye he
[1:10:23] lets him look around and as he looks
[1:10:26] around he he sees things to come and
[1:10:30] then he comes back down making the
[1:10:32] members of a body to foretell them of
[1:10:36] what is in the making now it it is
[1:10:39] amazing to me I I grew up in an era you
[1:10:41] know where where I won't tell you some
[1:10:43] of the music because it'll bring rhythms
[1:10:45] to you but you know I'll take one that
[1:10:47] brother Brown and we talk about Elvis
[1:10:49] and The Beatles and different things but
[1:10:50] they talked about Pat Boon I said who is
[1:10:53] Pat Boon Like Pat Boon and and and is
[1:10:56] like that was nothing terrible about
[1:10:58] that but I'll tell you what it was in 19
[1:11:01] I think 1990s or somewhere like that
[1:11:03] here Pat Boon comes out and he makes a a
[1:11:05] record with a a rock band I won't
[1:11:09] mention their name but he a title of it
[1:11:11] was nice No More Mr Nice Guy now what
[1:11:15] what was the spirit that showed that to
[1:11:18] brother Brandon what was the spirit that
[1:11:20] was behind that and I say that to give
[1:11:22] you confidence that these little things
[1:11:26] you know little things like brother bam
[1:11:27] says I I see the spirit of Elvis Presley
[1:11:31] leading the world to an Armageddon I see
[1:11:34] natives with little tubes in their ears
[1:11:37] way before we ever had
[1:11:39] earbuds where where what was it it's God
[1:11:43] for telling us these things amen so now
[1:11:47] also in in the same message brother
[1:11:49] brandham would say it this way the word
[1:11:51] of God that that then the word of God
[1:11:54] that has been spoken before the
[1:11:57] foundation of the world it isn't that
[1:11:59] God speaks and says something to the
[1:12:03] prophet at that time it's that the
[1:12:06] prophet catches what God has already
[1:12:09] said for the word was before the
[1:12:12] foundation of the world God spoke the
[1:12:14] word its laying way out it's stretched
[1:12:17] out in time and the prophet goes up and
[1:12:20] he sees the time coming it's only a gift
[1:12:23] of knowledge and brings it down in puts
[1:12:25] it on paper it's it's if I had a
[1:12:27] platform here I'd cly he's seeing things
[1:12:30] a far off that we're not seeing but we
[1:12:33] believe what God has been speaking to us
[1:12:36] and we conduct ourselves without seeing
[1:12:38] the end but we know we're in the spirit
[1:12:40] of something that's right now I if if I
[1:12:44] can just take these thoughts and I'm
[1:12:45] just allow me to to just uh bring bring
[1:12:50] this forward a little bit because we've
[1:12:53] been painted a picture brother Ron just
[1:12:56] alluded to some of
[1:12:57] it the things that we see coming to pass
[1:13:00] around us and and we can look at things
[1:13:02] we can look at what's going on in
[1:13:05] California we can we can see those
[1:13:08] things we can see what's happening in
[1:13:11] Israel and I and I say this because
[1:13:14] we've been told we're also looking we're
[1:13:17] more aware than any other people in the
[1:13:19] earth when in California there an
[1:13:21] earthquake or Israel how significant is
[1:13:24] o October 7th 50 years to the day from
[1:13:27] from the last Invasion back in
[1:13:30] 1993 and and and and it was right on the
[1:13:33] holiest Day of Israel all of these
[1:13:35] things have a significance amen my my my
[1:13:38] wife's got a birthday coming up this
[1:13:40] month she's going to drive up her
[1:13:41] average age again and and uh and it's on
[1:13:45] on January 26 well the day before there
[1:13:48] are seven planets aligning now don't ask
[1:13:51] me what it means but I take what brother
[1:13:53] brandham says when he it's in 1962 I
[1:13:56] think it's end time seed sign he's going
[1:13:59] he's pointing to planets Alig three
[1:14:02] aligned at Jesus coming five aligned
[1:14:06] when when when he was there at that
[1:14:07] moment and he's talking to events that
[1:14:10] are happening in the earth you know this
[1:14:12] England washed off the mat floods there
[1:14:14] this is that and he says what is it and
[1:14:17] then he brings out the spiritual
[1:14:18] application it's a bride coming into her
[1:14:22] infancy in her infancy
[1:14:25] I tell you what there's more that that
[1:14:28] the bride is coming to since that time
[1:14:31] and I'm not the prophet to declare
[1:14:32] that's what the seven planets that's not
[1:14:34] me but I'll just say these things are
[1:14:37] out there but we need to see beyond just
[1:14:39] that we need to see what's happening in
[1:14:41] here and I trust something's happening
[1:14:44] the word is more real to me today than
[1:14:46] ever
[1:14:47] before so he he he would he we can say
[1:14:51] you know we look at the presidents and
[1:14:53] we all we were all looking to see if if
[1:14:55] it would be a woman president or you
[1:14:57] know is it a woman system you know
[1:14:58] brother bam says it both ways and you
[1:15:00] know the one thing we have to
[1:15:02] remember sometimes he's
[1:15:05] looking at something and he's describing
[1:15:08] what he sees maybe symbolic so we have
[1:15:12] to let God interpret that and and I I
[1:15:16] believe that everything is being
[1:15:18] fulfilled
[1:15:19] exactly but you can look at all of those
[1:15:22] things and if you're a follower you know
[1:15:25] you can just say Well when California
[1:15:26] sinks when when there's a woman present
[1:15:29] when when Israel does this then I'll do
[1:15:31] this I'll just say that if you're on
[1:15:33] that level you're missing something and
[1:15:35] and I need to go to a level that's
[1:15:37] beyond that there's a faith realm that
[1:15:39] we've got to get there's a cycle we've
[1:15:41] got to get into now and I take it this
[1:15:44] way because I I I took this in in
[1:15:46] several services at home and I I'm
[1:15:48] bringing parts of several messages and I
[1:15:51] and I took it just to start standing we
[1:15:53] we're like we're standing
[1:15:55] in the midst of an un and we're watching
[1:15:57] but I'm taking this from standing to
[1:16:00] being a participant to being a key cog
[1:16:03] in what's happening around us cuz it was
[1:16:05] like
[1:16:06] Abraham three men came and visited him
[1:16:10] and Abraham recognized the one for what
[1:16:12] it was and and he had a visitation in in
[1:16:16] in Genesis Chapter 18 and then the two
[1:16:18] men went on their way and they went down
[1:16:20] to
[1:16:21] Sodom and they went down to Sodom and
[1:16:24] and we recognize that's type to this
[1:16:26] very age that was a Billy Graham and and
[1:16:29] an or Roberts and each were a messenger
[1:16:31] to the to the age but here is Abraham
[1:16:35] and now I I love I love these types
[1:16:37] because they're so real to me and and
[1:16:40] and and and God knew he in fact he was
[1:16:42] sending destroying Angels down to Sodom
[1:16:47] but he said I've got to stop and see
[1:16:50] Abraham first Abraham was the friend of
[1:16:54] God and he said I've got to see Abraham
[1:16:57] and he knew what was in Abraham he knew
[1:16:59] what was formed in him and Abraham
[1:17:01] begins pleading because he knows Lots
[1:17:04] down there now now listen we we we all
[1:17:07] have somebody that we know that is
[1:17:09] somewhere but how do you know that your
[1:17:12] prayers aren't stopping or holding back
[1:17:15] the Judgment of God on their lives and
[1:17:18] to me this is so real when I read it
[1:17:20] brother Ron I read how Abraham is there
[1:17:23] begging and pleading and from from 40 to
[1:17:26] 40 from 45 to 40 to 3530 and he comes
[1:17:29] down to 10 and then it looks like the
[1:17:32] angel left off and and and and okay but
[1:17:36] the Angels now here they're going to
[1:17:38] destroy the next scripture you read in
[1:17:40] there is they're going to get lot and
[1:17:42] they said lot you've got to come out
[1:17:44] because we can't do anything now what
[1:17:47] was holding them back it was Abraham's
[1:17:51] prayer that was in the middle of it we
[1:17:53] can't do anything until you come out do
[1:17:57] you make a difference absolutely we make
[1:17:59] a difference the bride of Christ is here
[1:18:02] for a
[1:18:04] purpose and the scripture says and and
[1:18:07] you can read it in Genesis 19 and God
[1:18:10] remembered
[1:18:12] Abraham and delivered lot out of the
[1:18:14] city who did he remember
[1:18:17] Abraham friends we are here for a
[1:18:19] purpose we got a great responsibility
[1:18:22] amen and I say I want to take it
[1:18:25] and we all know somebody and you could
[1:18:27] be standing for them and God's going to
[1:18:29] make a
[1:18:33] way we are
[1:18:35] participators we are
[1:18:38] intercessors now God gives us this this
[1:18:44] vision and and it's an unfolding and I
[1:18:47] want to take it now just beyond the
[1:18:49] natural Visions for a moment you know
[1:18:53] when when brother Brandon would have a
[1:18:55] vision and and it was things that he
[1:18:57] learned early in his Christian walk and
[1:19:01] he said God showed me a vision I'm going
[1:19:03] to walk in a room I'm going to pray for
[1:19:05] this person and he went and did it and
[1:19:06] then he realized he missed the sequence
[1:19:10] and he missed not following his part
[1:19:13] somebody had to lay a hat down some
[1:19:16] older woman had to be in a room and he
[1:19:19] realized he missed it and then he's
[1:19:22] praying before God oh for gift me Lord I
[1:19:26] missed it I missed it now he couldn't
[1:19:30] tell anyone else what to do he couldn't
[1:19:33] tell them hey move that hat over here he
[1:19:36] couldn't do it it was under the
[1:19:38] Sovereign orchestration of God
[1:19:41] hallelujah and so he's waiting and he's
[1:19:43] waiting all night if you read the for
[1:19:44] the account and he says there has to be
[1:19:46] this certain person come and then at the
[1:19:48] last minute somebody's getting ready to
[1:19:50] leave oh he can't leave he can't and all
[1:19:52] a sudden that person shows up and he
[1:19:54] comes he lays the Hat down he says now
[1:19:56] let me pray again and when he prayed why
[1:19:59] he stepped into his position amen and so
[1:20:04] we have a position now we're not
[1:20:06] prophets but every one of us has a place
[1:20:10] every member of the Bride has a place
[1:20:12] that they can be a part of and whatever
[1:20:15] that place is I want to be faithful to
[1:20:18] it
[1:20:21] Hallelujah brother Theo orasmus precious
[1:20:24] brother many years ago he told a story
[1:20:28] down in South
[1:20:30] Africa and uh he was preaching at the
[1:20:34] church and a sister was a very gifted s
[1:20:37] sister singing had a gift and bless the
[1:20:41] body of Christ she comes to him one day
[1:20:44] and
[1:20:45] says brother
[1:20:47] Theo I just
[1:20:49] ask I'd like to clean the
[1:20:52] church he says sister you bless us was
[1:20:54] singing and you do those things to clean
[1:20:57] the church so I know and she was
[1:20:59] persistent so she started cleaning the
[1:21:02] church a couple months later brother
[1:21:05] Theo says he's ministering and in the
[1:21:07] middle of the service somebody's just
[1:21:11] healed and and and he noticed that it's
[1:21:13] happening more regularly and he comes to
[1:21:16] find that this sister when she would
[1:21:19] come into the church and she'd clean the
[1:21:21] pews as she's cleaning the Pew she's
[1:21:24] praying Lord bless the person that sits
[1:21:26] here bless the person that sits here B
[1:21:29] and and what's she doing she's laying a
[1:21:32] foundation a preparation we all bring an
[1:21:35] atmosphere we all bring something
[1:21:38] doesn't matter what a position is but
[1:21:40] we're all
[1:21:41] contributors now I got to keep my focus
[1:21:44] and keep going so now brother brandom he
[1:21:47] he could not orchestrate the vision now
[1:21:50] this came out I think it was brother
[1:21:51] Evans who lost his car somebody stole
[1:21:54] his car and after service they got
[1:21:57] together the brothers got together and
[1:21:58] prayed and as they prayed then brother
[1:22:00] brandham saw a vision and he says I saw
[1:22:03] a man driving a car out to Bowling Green
[1:22:05] and he says and the man was a Christian
[1:22:07] so we sent the word out and the word
[1:22:10] because he was a Christian could deal
[1:22:12] with him and he says you're doing wrong
[1:22:14] he got under conviction he parked the
[1:22:16] car and they went to a certain
[1:22:19] place now in the middle of all of that
[1:22:24] you know we're we're looking for
[1:22:25] marching orders from from everyone that
[1:22:27] was Sovereign but I think it was brother
[1:22:29] Evans later on there was a man that know
[1:22:31] owed him some money he's driving with
[1:22:33] brother brandham they're going past a
[1:22:35] certain town now the man that owed him
[1:22:37] the money was not a Christian and so
[1:22:39] brother brandham saying oh man if he
[1:22:42] could just realize you know that if he
[1:22:44] would just go down and talk to him and
[1:22:46] he says but I can't tell him I really
[1:22:49] love how the prophet was he always
[1:22:51] respected that God had to do something
[1:22:54] he said I can't tell him and they're
[1:22:56] passing the sign he said oh Lord let him
[1:22:57] get it let him get it and then the man
[1:22:59] says Hey brother brandom down there's
[1:23:01] that City there's that guy that owes me
[1:23:03] do you think we could pop by there he oh
[1:23:04] yes we can down they go and and they
[1:23:07] confronted him and he he paid them back
[1:23:09] now different different outflow and
[1:23:12] different outgoing but it was God
[1:23:14] working and I I would just say it's God
[1:23:17] who's directing every member of the body
[1:23:21] it it we can tell each other you do this
[1:23:22] you do that but I'll just say I give
[1:23:24] lots of room in every service for God to
[1:23:28] deal there's times brother on you I'm
[1:23:30] sure you feel the same way you know and
[1:23:32] you're on a subject and you feel like
[1:23:34] going down and saying brother this is
[1:23:35] for you just listen to this this you got
[1:23:37] to catch this part but you can't do that
[1:23:43] amen God help us in our carnality Amen
[1:23:47] brother Brandon would say in the
[1:23:48] unveiling of God and he's typing it out
[1:23:51] to Jesus he'd say when Jesus went from
[1:23:54] first Pole to Second Pole to third pole
[1:23:57] under third poll he says except you eat
[1:23:59] the Flesh of the son of man and drink
[1:24:01] drink his blood he never explained it
[1:24:05] and and he didn't do it but it was under
[1:24:07] that last pull and it was done that way
[1:24:09] for a purpose and brother Ram says now
[1:24:11] the message is at the same place he says
[1:24:15] I can't come out and say things but if
[1:24:18] you're elect you'll catch
[1:24:20] it and that's the way even in the
[1:24:23] ministering as much as we would like to
[1:24:25] change things I just throw the word out
[1:24:27] and say Lord you have to do the work
[1:24:30] because we we've gone from a man
[1:24:32] anointing over into an eagle anointing
[1:24:34] and it is not just the hand of man you
[1:24:36] know just cuff somebody and yeah you've
[1:24:38] got to do it but you also want to see
[1:24:40] God deal with
[1:24:43] somebody now as we move along here just
[1:24:46] a little bit and I I need to take this
[1:24:50] if I can
[1:24:55] in into I'm going to share a couple of
[1:24:57] quotes these I didn't give you so just
[1:24:59] hang on but brother Brandon would talk
[1:25:03] and he would say how under you know the
[1:25:07] materializing of a vision how it would
[1:25:09] start out and he would he would see a
[1:25:10] little girl and she'd grow up and and as
[1:25:13] she grew up I see you as oh and I see
[1:25:15] and he begin to see the whole thing but
[1:25:16] it didn't happen even as he had the
[1:25:19] vision he was watching what he saw and
[1:25:22] he was speaking what he saw and and he
[1:25:24] would say now I I could see where she's
[1:25:27] at now I oh she's in a hospital and and
[1:25:30] before I speak it I see the person go
[1:25:32] away and I say the Lord bless you heal
[1:25:34] you he already
[1:25:36] has oh what a tremendous thing that is
[1:25:39] and then I turned around and I'd look at
[1:25:40] somebody and I could see them walking
[1:25:42] down the street like this and and and
[1:25:45] and they were doing like this and and
[1:25:46] then brother bam with assurity in the
[1:25:49] vision he could say he says I see a with
[1:25:51] a doll in her arm walking he says oh all
[1:25:53] the devil in hell can't stop it now look
[1:25:57] at the faith he had in what God was
[1:25:59] giving him and if he would have that I
[1:26:02] could have the same faith not just in
[1:26:04] the natural vision but in the spiritual
[1:26:06] vision that's been painted he says I can
[1:26:09] only say what God has showed me and
[1:26:11] tells me what to say and I can only say
[1:26:15] only see him materializing in front of
[1:26:17] me nothing else I can do but he says the
[1:26:20] man is not going to die with that cancer
[1:26:24] he's going to live and it never failed
[1:26:28] and I say thank God for such a gift in
[1:26:30] Our
[1:26:32] Generation Now I want to move this where
[1:26:36] it becomes more real to us because I I
[1:26:38] believe we don't want to just point back
[1:26:41] and say well brother BR I believe it
[1:26:42] needs to permeate Our Lives permeate
[1:26:45] where we're living at and and and as
[1:26:49] brother Brandon would talk he talked
[1:26:50] about even talked about Moses and how
[1:26:53] Moses
[1:26:54] you know he had
[1:26:57] intellectual faith and he had qualities
[1:27:01] that God had placed in him but they had
[1:27:04] to come to life and and I would say the
[1:27:07] same for me I I grew up in a home and
[1:27:10] around the message was we had a a split
[1:27:13] home and father believed one thing and
[1:27:15] mother but all along there was always
[1:27:18] something in me and and I knew one
[1:27:20] weekend at Dad's church and one at Mom's
[1:27:23] and at my dad say hey if I'm ever going
[1:27:25] to have a good time that's the church
[1:27:26] I'll go to but I also knew if I'm ever
[1:27:28] going to get real with God I'll go where
[1:27:31] Mom goes who was a believer of the
[1:27:33] message and and it wasn't just because
[1:27:35] she went there but it was I knew in some
[1:27:38] of those Services there was something
[1:27:40] more that was there brother meno I was a
[1:27:43] 12-year-old boy I was down in the camp
[1:27:45] meetings in Saskatchewan in the tent the
[1:27:47] Believers were singing and I'll tell you
[1:27:50] what I I as rambunctious as I was in
[1:27:52] doing things when they started singing
[1:27:54] and I just stood up and I was just into
[1:27:56] it and I remember it was there even as a
[1:27:58] 12-year-old boy down at the river where
[1:28:01] they were baptizing I said I want to be
[1:28:02] baptized too and and and you know I
[1:28:05] really hadn't had much of a change to
[1:28:07] lead up to that so it never happened but
[1:28:10] I'll just say that was always there but
[1:28:11] it had to be quickened in the right
[1:28:13] season and so when it when it was
[1:28:16] finally quickened how I thank God for it
[1:28:18] it came just at the right time so Moses
[1:28:21] had these gifts and and and he had an
[1:28:23] intellectual conception but he never
[1:28:26] could bring it until the light flashed
[1:28:28] across him something that not he just
[1:28:30] read about but something he'd seen with
[1:28:33] his eyes something that spoke to him and
[1:28:36] something that spoke back oh how it
[1:28:39] brings to life I'll say this friends
[1:28:41] you've got to get to that place whatever
[1:28:43] you do that you have you know it was God
[1:28:47] Amen
[1:28:48] hey if my parents quit the message I'm
[1:28:51] going on there is no plan be I'm sold
[1:28:55] out to
[1:28:57] thisall and he would say I think any man
[1:29:01] or woman boy or girl that has an
[1:29:03] intellectual conception of the word and
[1:29:05] so forth can never have a full
[1:29:07] Foundation until they met that light and
[1:29:11] Moses he says they met that light that
[1:29:14] brings the word to
[1:29:16] reality Moses with this great call but
[1:29:20] one day when he met that then he got his
[1:29:23] anointing the anointing that he had was
[1:29:25] inside not just the intellects but a
[1:29:28] faith that is based on a belief from God
[1:29:31] that separated him from his mother it
[1:29:34] strikes him in the presence of this
[1:29:36] light it anointed him that he was
[1:29:40] believed intellectually he had
[1:29:45] believed you
[1:29:47] know sometimes we don't see it unfolding
[1:29:49] in front of us you know it's like I
[1:29:53] think it's about s years years ago since
[1:29:54] I was last year and sometimes we come
[1:29:57] and and you see the kids and they go
[1:30:00] that's not your kids I saw them just
[1:30:02] seven years ago and they're like this
[1:30:05] high and you look at them and go my how
[1:30:08] you've
[1:30:09] grown and they look at you and my how
[1:30:12] you've
[1:30:13] grown yeah thank
[1:30:15] you go play with your
[1:30:20] parents New Year is always is a time for
[1:30:22] resolutions
[1:30:24] brother Ed what's your resolution I need
[1:30:26] to lose 20 PBS how you doing 25 more to
[1:30:30] go I'm there yeah I'm
[1:30:36] there you
[1:30:38] know we we we can't see things as they
[1:30:40] happen day by day but there's a seed
[1:30:43] that's
[1:30:45] growing and and and as and and and we
[1:30:48] don't see it and and and brother
[1:30:50] brandham would would speak about about
[1:30:53] these different things and how they're
[1:30:55] around us and and he
[1:30:58] said you know and and I I'm just trying
[1:31:02] to find the right place here but he he
[1:31:04] would he would talk about these things
[1:31:06] listen just turn with me if you will to
[1:31:09] um let's go to Psalms 139 for a moment
[1:31:13] Psalms 13 this is one of my favorite
[1:31:16] scriptures in the in the whole Bible I I
[1:31:19] honestly I could read the whole one but
[1:31:22] but it's David catching a revelation of
[1:31:25] you know God you see my downsitting my
[1:31:27] Uprising you understand all of these
[1:31:30] things you you Compass my ways you're
[1:31:32] behind me you're in front of me you're
[1:31:34] you're you're everywhere it's it's too
[1:31:36] much if I make my bed in hell you're
[1:31:37] there if you're so David's catching
[1:31:39] something of the thoughts of God and and
[1:31:43] really if if we would say the message is
[1:31:46] not us pulling ourselves up but the
[1:31:49] message is revealing who we really are
[1:31:52] and it's opening who we really are are
[1:31:54] the real you the thoughts of God the
[1:31:57] Eternal quality that was always there
[1:32:00] and and I would say it's it's not a
[1:32:02] knowledge we're trying to find we want
[1:32:04] to see ourselves in the light of our
[1:32:06] savior who has redeemed us so in verse
[1:32:09] in verse uh 14 David says I will pre
[1:32:14] praise thee for I am fearfully and
[1:32:16] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[1:32:19] and that my soul knoweth right well my
[1:32:23] substance was not hid from thee when I
[1:32:26] was made in secret and curiously wrought
[1:32:29] in the lowest parts of the earth now
[1:32:32] here I like this verse 16 Thine Eyes did
[1:32:35] see my substance yet being unperfect or
[1:32:39] not having matured yet in other words it
[1:32:42] was always there there was a picture in
[1:32:45] the mind of God of who you would be what
[1:32:49] you would be in the end you know those
[1:32:51] those photo albums you you look back and
[1:32:53] you think think oh that was us in the
[1:32:55] 70s yeah I can tell cuz we're wearing
[1:32:57] those polka dot pants with flares in
[1:32:58] them and and this is us with that and oh
[1:33:01] that's when the horn RM glasses are in
[1:33:02] oh they're back in now if you if you
[1:33:04] ever need those old clothes keep them
[1:33:06] they'll come back around don't worry so
[1:33:08] you know you look at all these things
[1:33:10] but God's photo album's different right
[1:33:13] he's looking to your perfect being and
[1:33:16] he sees you over there oh they're not
[1:33:18] quite there yet they're coming they're
[1:33:20] coming they're coming and and he's
[1:33:22] working on us he's working on us day by
[1:33:25] day he's forming us he's shaping us he's
[1:33:28] bringing our character he's bringing
[1:33:31] everything in line oh we ought to thank
[1:33:33] god oh I have trials but you know our
[1:33:36] trials are different they're not like
[1:33:38] the world's trials our trials have a
[1:33:41] purpose they're not for our destruction
[1:33:44] they are for our edification they are
[1:33:47] there for our
[1:33:49] Perfection and so David saying you saw
[1:33:52] my substance
[1:33:54] yet being
[1:33:55] unperfect and in thy book all my members
[1:33:58] were written which in continuance were
[1:34:02] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[1:34:05] them oh I'm so thankful he before there
[1:34:09] was a speck of
[1:34:11] Stardust the bride was in his mind you
[1:34:15] know the thoughts of God are different
[1:34:17] like you
[1:34:19] know you know brother Aaron or brother
[1:34:22] brother Robert if I say to you you know
[1:34:26] AEL give me your first thought of
[1:34:29] AEL the praise that night the praise at
[1:34:32] night I we all remember that now before
[1:34:34] he could utter those words he had to
[1:34:37] think about them yeah so he had to
[1:34:40] thought so there had to be something you
[1:34:42] could go back to now before God could
[1:34:44] ever speak a word concerning us he had
[1:34:47] to have a thought and it wasn't just oh
[1:34:49] let me think of this no they were always
[1:34:52] there the thought of God have never
[1:34:55] changed they're
[1:34:57] Eternal and he thought of me and he
[1:34:59] thought of you and he thought of this
[1:35:01] meeting and and he knew that there be
[1:35:04] some Elders here and he knew what we'd
[1:35:06] be gathering listen we have come
[1:35:08] together for This Moment by the thoughts
[1:35:11] of God by his Divine
[1:35:15] orchestration be it unto me according to
[1:35:17] your word
[1:35:20] Lord in continuance they were fashioned
[1:35:23] how precious also are thy thoughts unto
[1:35:25] me oh God how great is the sum of them
[1:35:29] if I should count them they are more in
[1:35:31] number than the sand when I awake I am
[1:35:34] still with thee oh I I love the
[1:35:38] materializing the
[1:35:40] unfolding it's it's beautiful to
[1:35:46] watch so brother Brandon would bring
[1:35:48] this and he talks about it
[1:35:51] and and he he's just talking about how
[1:35:55] there's all of these things that are
[1:35:56] coming and and it brings us and it moves
[1:35:59] us and let me just take it this way if
[1:36:02] you if you P up pull
[1:36:05] up the why Christ speak I want to just
[1:36:08] take this because brother Bram would
[1:36:11] would say it this way and I I really
[1:36:13] love how he says it and and he talks
[1:36:15] about it and he
[1:36:16] says and it anoints us when we see where
[1:36:20] we're living in the last days when we
[1:36:23] see all the signs that are taking place
[1:36:26] spoke of in the scripture taking place
[1:36:28] in the last days this is all the way to
[1:36:31] heaven to the political powers to the
[1:36:34] nature of people to the demoralization
[1:36:37] of the world among the women and how
[1:36:39] they would do these last days and how
[1:36:40] men would do and how the churches would
[1:36:42] do and how the nations would do and how
[1:36:45] God would do and we see this all laying
[1:36:47] before us now it's wonderful to see
[1:36:50] that but you know there ought to be
[1:36:52] something in you that also says I am not
[1:36:54] a part of that I am so glad that I can't
[1:36:58] where I once hungered for those things
[1:37:00] the by the new birth I have a different
[1:37:02] hunger I have a different sanctification
[1:37:06] oh and it it's like the dove I can't
[1:37:08] feed on those things anymore friends I I
[1:37:11] believe sometimes we just need to get
[1:37:13] more in tune with God and these things
[1:37:15] will repulse us I I you know what the
[1:37:18] devil wants to get you in his cycle but
[1:37:21] God wants us in his cycle and and and
[1:37:24] you've got to be in a cycle in order to
[1:37:26] be there at the
[1:37:28] end now he says it anoints our
[1:37:31] faith it moves us out into great Cycles
[1:37:36] see it separates us from the things of
[1:37:39] the world no matter how little we are
[1:37:43] how much of a minority we are how much
[1:37:44] we're laughed at made fun of it that
[1:37:47] doesn't make a bit of
[1:37:49] difference used to be a time I would
[1:37:52] come to church and I have to drive and
[1:37:54] go past the neighbor I duck so my
[1:37:56] friends couldn't see me tell you what
[1:37:59] nowadays class reunion and they said Ed
[1:38:03] hammermeister you're a pastor you're a
[1:38:06] preacher how'd that happen said it
[1:38:08] wasn't me God determined it for me and
[1:38:12] I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed of it
[1:38:14] anymore used to be he said there's
[1:38:18] something within
[1:38:19] us we were predestinated to see this
[1:38:22] hour there is nothing that is going to
[1:38:25] stop us from seeing it amen God spoke it
[1:38:28] it's already happened we see it oh how
[1:38:31] we thank God for this it brings out your
[1:38:34] faith when we see these things happening
[1:38:37] listen I I don't rejoice as brother Ron
[1:38:39] would said about what's happening there
[1:38:41] I don't Rejoice about those things but I
[1:38:43] just have a quickening in my heart it's
[1:38:45] closer than it's ever been before it's
[1:38:48] real than ever before and it causes me
[1:38:50] to go into the word more than ever
[1:38:52] before
[1:38:54] why cuz I've got a part to play in all
[1:38:56] of
[1:38:57] this I'm not just a
[1:38:59] bystander you know like like I I used to
[1:39:03] play sports and I in in basketball I
[1:39:05] wasn't as tall as some of the other guys
[1:39:07] and but I was on the bench but I mean
[1:39:09] you got somebody who's on the bench I'm
[1:39:11] not doing anything you know and just
[1:39:13] back there and all a sudden the player
[1:39:14] gets injured the coach calls you oh yeah
[1:39:16] yeah what's what's what's going on in no
[1:39:19] if you're on the bench wait till your
[1:39:21] appointed time be in the spirit be
[1:39:25] clapping be participating be a part of
[1:39:28] it and then when you're called to step
[1:39:30] out you don't know the hour you don't
[1:39:32] know the place but God does and he is
[1:39:36] God he's working on you he's preparing
[1:39:38] you he's setting us up for the greatest
[1:39:42] move that has ever happened on the face
[1:39:43] of the
[1:39:44] Earth praise Lord I believe the best is
[1:39:47] yet to
[1:39:51] come now
[1:39:55] as this vision is unfolding it's not
[1:39:57] just outside events but it's something
[1:39:59] on inside of us that is being made real
[1:40:03] to us and we want to see it and even
[1:40:05] brother brandham would cry out and say
[1:40:07] oh I need a repentance I need to say I
[1:40:09] need a Revival I need a shaking I need a
[1:40:12] wakening up now he's living in the
[1:40:16] middle of an

[1:44:53] he did this than you he brought me here
[1:44:56] step by step the devil told me I wasn't
[1:44:58] even good enough to be in
[1:45:00] church and and listen that's a funny
[1:45:02] thing he he he he leaves you alone and
[1:45:05] then the minute you come to church he
[1:45:06] says you're not good enough and then the
[1:45:08] minute you do something wrong then he
[1:45:09] condemns you again I said listen either
[1:45:11] I'm not good enough or I did wrong which
[1:45:14] way is it going to be you can't have it
[1:45:16] both ways that's right and I'll tell you

[1:45:48] good you got this disease you got this
[1:45:50] situation you got this I'm me say
[1:45:53] something the future is not in the
[1:45:54] devil's hands the future is in God's
[1:45:57] hands your future is in his hands don't
[1:46:01] listen to him cast all your cares on him
[1:46:05] he's a liar to begin
[1:46:07] with my future is in him who called me
[1:46:10] and loved me and washed me it's him who
[1:46:14] brought me this far it's him who will
[1:46:16] bring me all the way through it is him
[1:46:20] and not only me but all that I love and
[1:46:22] my family and my loved ones it is
[1:46:28] him thank you Lord there was
[1:46:33] a there was a scripture or there's a
[1:46:36] quotation I came to and it was beautiful
[1:46:39] when I got to
[1:46:41] it brother bam says from the beginning
[1:46:43] it was not
[1:46:44] so God by Vision has told me my Ministry
[1:46:49] is going to
[1:46:50] change and he says I'm long in for it to
[1:46:53] to happen I'll be able to preach the
[1:46:56] gospel in such a way that it will do
[1:46:59] something that will help suffering
[1:47:02] Humanity to a happier way of life and a
[1:47:06] healthier way of life it's my sincere
[1:47:09] desire and then he follows it through
[1:47:12] and he he says now I want to make a
[1:47:14] statement there's a new ministry coming
[1:47:18] and he will tell it it's greater than
[1:47:20] all the rest put together it's already
[1:47:23] confirmed this is in Be not Afraid 1960
[1:47:26] he said the hour is at hand I believe
[1:47:29] when God is going to help his children
[1:47:32] now he makes a distinction here it'll
[1:47:33] especially be for those who cannot reach
[1:47:37] up and get a hold of God like they
[1:47:38] should I believe the Lord is providing a
[1:47:42] way for us now to take care of them I
[1:47:46] believe that God has Elders he has
[1:47:48] parents he has people that are looking
[1:47:51] out for you when you can't look out for
[1:47:53] yourself he'll put you on pray on
[1:47:56] somebody's heart for prayer they'll call
[1:47:58] you they'll text you and I just say be
[1:48:01] faithful yes don't don't ever if God lay
[1:48:04] some I say be a be a benefit to the
[1:48:07] kingdom of God and he goes on to say
[1:48:11] some of us has faith we can reach
[1:48:13] anything that's great faith others has
[1:48:16] Mustard Seed Faith and have to wait so
[1:48:19] long to get through now he says I
[1:48:22] believe believe the Lord is making a way
[1:48:25] for those people now I don't know when
[1:48:28] it will be but it will be just as
[1:48:32] certain as I'm standing here the same
[1:48:34] God that was with Moses when he had
[1:48:37] Pharaoh in his face saying you can go
[1:48:39] with a man you can go for three days and
[1:48:42] Moses said I will not leave a hoof
[1:48:47] behind my
[1:48:50] grandmother escaped the Second World War
[1:48:54] under in Germany where they lived under
[1:48:57] the the Russian army that was coming
[1:49:00] back and they came back to Germany and
[1:49:03] she felt him pressed not to stay in East
[1:49:05] Germany but to go to West and they lost
[1:49:08] everything she lost her grandfather she
[1:49:11] had nine kids the youngest was two
[1:49:13] months old the oldest one was 13 my
[1:49:17] mother was the second
[1:49:19] oldest they had
[1:49:21] nothing and they were there there and
[1:49:23] God just so supernaturally looked after
[1:49:25] them he says she knew she had her
[1:49:29] brother had her husband had a sister
[1:49:32] somewhere in Canada but she didn't know
[1:49:34] where all the records were gone one
[1:49:36] night she had a dream she's writing a
[1:49:38] letter to Canada she remembers the
[1:49:41] address she writes to that address and
[1:49:44] it's exactly where her sisterin-law was
[1:49:48] Hallelujah now God wasn't just looking
[1:49:51] at her and the children
[1:49:53] but I was down the lineage there was
[1:49:56] others down the
[1:49:57] lineage God was watching over them
[1:49:59] naturally but Also
[1:50:02] spiritually oh what can we do to help
[1:50:04] you he can we send you clothes we no

[1:51:15] scripture in the book of
[1:51:17] Exodus I will leave neither hoof behind
[1:51:22] amen
[1:51:23] I'll tell you what there's a God that is
[1:51:25] greater than everything that we
[1:51:28] have my grandmother my mom was the first
[1:51:31] one over she worked for six months sent

[1:51:36] all nine kids came before she left my
[1:51:39] grandma before she left she's in a
[1:51:41] Baptist Church in Germany and I think
[1:51:43] this is about 1954 1953 somewhere there
[1:51:47] and the man says you're going to Canada
[1:51:49] he says if you ever go to Canada and you
[1:51:51] have a chance to hear
[1:51:53] of an evangelist named William Branham
[1:51:55] go and hear him amen 1957 brother
[1:51:59] Branham came to Edmonton for 10 meetings
[1:52:01] my grandma was in the meeting she didn't
[1:52:03] know what she was in the middle of but
[1:52:05] God was guiding her God was leading her
[1:52:09] and she began to take her position and
[1:52:10] she began to take it and she stood for
[1:52:12] this message till the day she
[1:52:15] died and she saw a young man like myself
[1:52:18] go Renegade and then she saw God turn
[1:52:21] him around amen thank you and it was a
[1:52:24] joy to her and it's a joy friends to see
[1:52:27] one come back to their place with god
[1:52:30] let's never lose
[1:52:32] that never lose
[1:52:35] it I
[1:52:37] digressed
[1:52:39] so as we read Revelations and I didn't I
[1:52:43] think I'm in the middle of verse 11 they
[1:52:47] overcame him by the blood of the L Lamb
[1:52:50] by the word of their testimony
[1:52:53] your testimony didn't start
[1:52:55] here had started with God before the
[1:52:58] foundation of the world you got called
[1:53:00] you were on the tip of the iceberg you
[1:53:02] didn't know what was behind it and I'll
[1:53:04] just say he who started this work will
[1:53:07] finish the
[1:53:08] work and he says and they overcame by
[1:53:11] the word of their testimony even when
[1:53:14] the devil has told you you'll never make
[1:53:15] it I'm just going to go to church anyhow
[1:53:17] I'm sold out there's no plan B and it
[1:53:20] says and they love not their lives to
[1:53:22] the death to be so sold out friends I
[1:53:26] there's been a few instance I've
[1:53:28] completely sold out my future into the
[1:53:30] hands of God and he has rewarded me
[1:53:33] abundantly never failed me
[1:53:38] yet and he says wherefore Rejoice you
[1:53:40] heavens and you that dwell in them woe
[1:53:43] to the inhabiters of the earth and of
[1:53:45] the sea for the devil has come unto you
[1:53:48] having great wrath because he knows that
[1:53:51] he has but a short time amen you ever
[1:53:54] wonder why there's such a challenge yeah
[1:53:57] hey he knows his days are over that's
[1:53:59] right he knows what's ahead for you and
[1:54:01] I Hallelujah he'll do anything he can to
[1:54:04] stop us let's take
[1:54:06] this out of the contest brother bam in
[1:54:10] 1963 at New Year's he's speaking and he
[1:54:13] says I want to speak for these few
[1:54:14] moments quickly about the greatest
[1:54:17] contest there ever has been between the
[1:54:19] church and Satan the great strength of
[1:54:22] Satan but I want to speak of the great
[1:54:25] strength of God in his church now this
[1:54:28] great contest has been going on for many
[1:54:30] years it started in heaven Satan was
[1:54:33] kicked out into the Earth and he became
[1:54:35] an enemy to God's people and since then
[1:54:39] he has used all his strength and
[1:54:41] strategy to try to pull God's people
[1:54:44] across the fires into his
[1:54:48] fires listen you will never fight the
[1:54:51] devil on is ground that's not what we've
[1:54:54] been called to don't go on the internet
[1:54:57] and say well I I'll be able to handle
[1:54:59] this that is not our territory yeah you
[1:55:01] use it for what it's used for but make
[1:55:04] sure there's a division so far and no
[1:55:07] more listen I know the devil is
[1:55:09] destroying young people and families and
[1:55:12] homes all by just getting caught in a
[1:55:15] cycle Doom scrolling and one after the
[1:55:18] other one after the other and then okay
[1:55:21] I'm done I'm was going to play a game
[1:55:23] for a half hour two hours later not even
[1:55:27] sinful oh just look at a few things I'll
[1:55:30] tell you what you'll never regret
[1:55:32] putting that device down and spending a
[1:55:34] few minutes in prayer you'll never
[1:55:36] regret taking a little time to encourage
[1:55:39] someone to think on the things of God I
[1:55:41] just this is real this is where it's at
[1:55:43] friends
[1:55:44] amen hey this is as much our battle as
[1:55:47] as the great Revelations are we've got
[1:55:50] to contain our own Spirit we've got to
[1:55:51] watch
[1:55:52] where where we where we're at with
[1:55:54] things he'll go on to
[1:55:56] say and you know who has the most power
[1:55:59] look all I can say is don't get pulled
[1:56:02] into Satan's fires amen don't go in a
[1:56:05] bar room to witness to somebody don't go
[1:56:07] on his ground don't get into a
[1:56:09] relationship it it'll take you way
[1:56:11] further than you want to go amen hey
[1:56:14] we've all been harmed we've all been
[1:56:15] injured thank God for grace that he
[1:56:17] pulled us back but let's learn from it
[1:56:20] let's teach others let's teach our
[1:56:24] children I'll say this to any young
[1:56:27] person I've been there played on the
[1:56:29] football team in high school Captain
[1:56:31] went to University played football did
[1:56:34] all of these things and I thought oh
[1:56:35] this is the epitome of it all and my
[1:56:37] life was going darker darker darker and
[1:56:41] God pulled me out and ever since then
[1:56:42] it's a star that's been rising out of
[1:56:45] the darkness and I'm so grateful to be
[1:56:47] where I
[1:56:49] am and I'm nothing in myself he'll try
[1:56:52] and pull me down too that's right so he
[1:56:55] says now and we know who has the most
[1:56:57] power God does and the best thing that
[1:57:00] he could do to combat Satan with was his
[1:57:02] word because the word is God and what's
[1:57:04] stronger than the god the word is God
[1:57:06] the word becomes our strength God in the
[1:57:09] church becomes its strength to pull
[1:57:12] Satan into his own fires that he has
[1:57:15] made and the tug goes on and God said
[1:57:19] and Jesus said in Mark 16 in my name
[1:57:21] they will cast without
[1:57:23] Devils now you just have to arm yourself
[1:57:26] with this thought you're going to meet
[1:57:27] the enemy you're going to meet him
[1:57:30] you're going to meet him somewhere and
[1:57:32] so the thing is know your enemy know
[1:57:35] your weaknesses I I know I just don't do
[1:57:38] good in the evening and that would be a
[1:57:40] time I'm susceptible so I'll do
[1:57:42] something that's hey it's not heavy it's
[1:57:43] not this but it's not going to be what
[1:57:45] the devil wants me to do that's right
[1:57:47] hey and if I'm not a Mourning person
[1:57:49] then then wherever you are recognize
[1:57:51] where you're weaknesses are and work
[1:57:54] with them according to what God has
[1:57:56] said in in the greatest battle the
[1:57:58] greatest battle that was ever fought in
[1:57:59] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[1:58:01] against Lucifer and his angels the first
[1:58:04] battle in heaven and sin did not
[1:58:06] originate in Earth it originated in
[1:58:07] heaven and it was thrown down from
[1:58:10] heaven cast out of Heaven fell on human
[1:58:12] beings then the battle from Angels
[1:58:15] became human battles and Satan came to
[1:58:18] destroy God's creation that God had
[1:58:21] created for himself self he came to
[1:58:22] destroy it that's his purpose is to
[1:58:25] destroy it the battle here on Earth
[1:58:27] begins in us it's been raging ever since
[1:58:31] how many are in a battle this
[1:58:34] morning just be
[1:58:36] honest ah hey he's there he's there in
[1:58:40] the morning he's there in the evening
[1:58:41] he's there in the middle of the service
[1:58:44] he's there wherever we're at
[1:58:47] amen and so we've got to be tressed
[1:58:50] ready for the battle
[1:58:52] we've got to be dressed for fighting we
[1:58:54] got to be trained for fighting that's
[1:58:56] the greatest battle God is training and
[1:58:58] selecting his soldiers now I'll just
[1:59:00] draw this this is familiar I'm going to
[1:59:02] have to move quickly now just to get to
[1:59:04] where I want to get to he says Satan
[1:59:08] knows this is that this book is the
[1:59:11] revelation of Jesus Christ in the church
[1:59:14] he knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:59:16] yesterday today and forever he says let
[1:59:18] me show you the reason he says he knows
[1:59:21] a lot more than theologians he knows God
[1:59:23] is immutable in his nature in his ways
[1:59:27] Satan knows that the original church at
[1:59:29] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[1:59:33] is the true church that Jesus claims as
[1:59:35] his own all else is false it has to be
[1:59:38] the true church is the continuation of
[1:59:42] the book of Acts but the Book of
[1:59:44] Revelation shows the Antichrist Spirit
[1:59:46] come into the church defile it making it
[1:59:49] lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes
[1:59:52] Satan his attempt his works his
[1:59:55] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:59:57] now here's the thing he he says
[2:00:01] discrediting of God's word right to the
[2:00:04] time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he
[2:00:07] fights it he cannot stand it now he
[2:00:10] knows something special here he knows if
[2:00:13] the people get the true revelation of
[2:00:17] the true church and what she is and what
[2:00:20] she stands for and that she can do the
[2:00:22] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[2:00:28] Army you know
[2:00:30] what he knows there's only so many
[2:00:32] message churches if I can get a little
[2:00:35] bit of a Schism between them if I can
[2:00:37] get this if if I can get that I I
[2:00:39] believe we're coming to maturity and
[2:00:41] I'll tell you what the tremendous
[2:00:42] victory in the love divine brother bam
[2:00:45] makes a statement that's outstanding to
[2:00:47] me he says do you want to be a real
[2:00:51] outstanding member in your
[2:00:53] church how many would want that hey fall
[2:00:57] in love with Jesus and when you fall in
[2:01:00] love with Jesus you'll fall in love with
[2:01:02] every member in your
[2:01:04] church and every member in every other
[2:01:08] Church ah but they're my enemies they
[2:01:10] said you may never get forgiven in this
[2:01:13] life but the power of forgiveness you
[2:01:15] can lay it down and say this will not be
[2:01:19] against me I I choose
[2:01:23] listen the most offended person in all
[2:01:27] the world was God by what Humanity did
[2:01:30] to him and he could have said there
[2:01:32] until you come back and gravel and make
[2:01:36] your way and do this I'm not touching
[2:01:38] you but you know what he did he says I
[2:01:42] will go down the one who bore the hurt
[2:01:45] the one who bore the pain I will go down
[2:01:48] I will make
[2:01:50] reconciliation I will choose to do this
[2:01:54] Hallelujah and he brings Fellowship back
[2:01:56] into it there's an example for you thank
[2:01:59] you
[2:02:01] Lord you have an opportunity to clear
[2:02:03] the
[2:02:04] record amen and you can clear the record
[2:02:08] and you know where you find these
[2:02:09] scriptures Mark
[2:02:10] 11 if you don't forgive neither will
[2:02:13] your father
[2:02:14] forgive and if you
[2:02:16] forgive you can say to this
[2:02:18] mountain be moved and it will be moved
[2:02:22] oh I I love it when there's a clear
[2:02:24] heart I don't understand all
[2:02:27] misunderstandings and things but I just
[2:02:30] say oh God let me be a real
[2:02:33] Christian
[2:02:37] now there's there's much I could go to
[2:02:40] let me let me go down this path just for
[2:02:42] a few
[2:02:43] minutes our weapon our weapons have
[2:02:47] naturally speaking in the last 150 years
[2:02:50] maybe 200 years
[2:02:52] we've gone from a bow and arrow to a
[2:02:56] spear to guns to rifles to cannons to
[2:03:00] missiles to atomic
[2:03:03] bombs now as the battle
[2:03:06] intensifies you're not going to go out
[2:03:08] against Russia with Spears and bow and
[2:03:11] arrow you're not going to go there you
[2:03:15] the battle's got to be fought on the
[2:03:17] level that it's escalated to
[2:03:20] amen now let me this scripture may not
[2:03:22] seem related right now but let me just
[2:03:24] take it for a moment Psalms chapter
[2:03:28] 1 no sorry Acts chapter 1 I'm sorry Acts
[2:03:31] chapter
[2:03:33] 1 and and in
[2:03:37] this Jesus would say this sorry I I'll
[2:03:41] keep moving quickly just help me pull a
[2:03:43] little bit and we'll move along quick so
[2:03:46] where when they therefore came together
[2:03:48] they asked him saying wilt thou at this
[2:03:50] time restore again the kingdom to Israel
[2:03:51] he said it's not for you to know the
[2:03:53] times and the seasons which the father
[2:03:56] has put in his own power now look at
[2:03:59] this next verse but you shall receive
[2:04:03] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[2:04:07] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[2:04:10] in Jerusalem in all
[2:04:13] Judea now I I'm I'm going to make a
[2:04:15] distinction here you receive power after
[2:04:19] the Holy Ghost has come on you that's
[2:04:21] right
[2:04:22] when you get the Holy Ghost that is the
[2:04:25] ceiling of your salvation amen that is
[2:04:29] God coming down and he is giving a new
[2:04:32] birth to the seed Gene it is being
[2:04:36] quickened you will never lose that
[2:04:39] that's right that's yours now you can
[2:04:41] grieve the holy spirit away and it'll
[2:04:44] it'll take its flight as brother Brandon
[2:04:46] would say but you never lose your
[2:04:48] salvation you never Lo lose the Holy
[2:04:50] Ghost so there's an anointing that comes
[2:04:53] with the Holy Ghost in its season now he
[2:04:57] says you brother if I can do it this way
[2:05:00] and and brother I would say you have
[2:05:02] power it's unlimited power in you but he
[2:05:06] says that power is limited it is
[2:05:09] governed by a law of Faith so you can
[2:05:13] only have the power by the Revelation
[2:05:17] that is loose to you so that's what
[2:05:20] gives you faith
[2:05:22] now I I I couldn't I couldn't go out
[2:05:24] there and go into a hospital and say I'm
[2:05:26] just going to go raise all the dead I
[2:05:28] wouldn't have faith for that cuz that's
[2:05:29] not the season we're in that's that's
[2:05:32] that's not what I I would do but but he
[2:05:35] says now and and we have to remember the
[2:05:37] Holy Ghost if we just take and and I'll
[2:05:40] just forgive me brother Ron you correct
[2:05:42] me if I'm going on a path but we can't
[2:05:44] view the Holy Ghost just in Pentecostal
[2:05:48] terms the the Holy Ghost is receiving
[2:05:50] the word for you your age and I'm not
[2:05:53] just talking knowledge but I'm see
[2:05:55] receiving the power of God that's loosed
[2:05:58] by Revelation in the hour that you live
[2:06:00] in now if I if I can say it this way
[2:06:03] Luke chapter 4 Jesus would
[2:06:07] say uh I'm anointed he would actually
[2:06:10] say I'm anointed to the the spirit of
[2:06:13] the Lord is in me he's anointed me and
[2:06:16] he gives a specific reason to preach the
[2:06:18] gospel to the poor to heal the
[2:06:20] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[2:06:22] the captives recovering of sight to the
[2:06:24] blind to preach the acceptable year of
[2:06:26] the Lord amen and he closed the book and
[2:06:30] he gave it to the minister and sat down
[2:06:32] the greatest anointing read some words
[2:06:35] and sit in a chair now we wouldn't think
[2:06:38] of it that way would we but that was the
[2:06:41] hour he lived in that was Jesus you know
[2:06:44] brother B would say it supreme power in
[2:06:48] control amen he could have done it what
[2:06:51] ever he wanted to but that was the
[2:06:53] greatest anointing now we we we need to
[2:06:58] recognize there's a holy ghost but
[2:07:01] there's also an anointing that comes
[2:07:03] with every Age and and I'll I'll just
[2:07:05] I'm going to just pull this a little bit
[2:07:07] out
[2:07:09] of I'll have to go quickly here in the
[2:07:13] Old
[2:07:14] Testament there was a
[2:07:16] tabernacle and then there was four
[2:07:18] tribes around each side and each had a
[2:07:20] banner and each had a symbol or an
[2:07:24] emblem a lion an ox uh an eagle a man
[2:07:29] and each
[2:07:30] represented God's protection to them sir
[2:07:35] it represented that now it also did that
[2:07:38] in the book of Acts or sorry in the New
[2:07:40] Testament under the four gospels there
[2:07:42] was again each gospel written with an
[2:07:46] anointing and a protection around the
[2:07:50] word that was there amen now now let me
[2:07:53] read a little bit of what what brother
[2:07:54] brandham would say and you'll find this
[2:07:56] in the fifth seal now and just just let
[2:07:59] me go quick I'm I'm doing it this he
[2:08:01] says notice as the Antichrist went for
[2:08:06] on his beasts of ministry God sent forth
[2:08:10] a beast to combat it now Satan is is
[2:08:15] great at replication he's great at
[2:08:17] Watching God he's great at watching you
[2:08:20] he he tries to repeat he tries to
[2:08:22] emulate he tries to do it but God always
[2:08:25] raises the standard amen so in the first
[2:08:28] age God sends an anointing he says on
[2:08:31] these beasts of ministry send forth a
[2:08:33] beast to combat
[2:08:35] it now watch every time the Beast Rose
[2:08:39] the Antichrist rose on his horse it
[2:08:41] began to announce his ministry but God
[2:08:44] sent a beast also and he was on that to
[2:08:48] announce his combat to it when the enemy
[2:08:51] comes in like a flood God will raise a
[2:08:53] standard to it so when the enemy went
[2:08:56] out as Antichrist God sent a certain
[2:08:58] type of power to meet him and then again
[2:09:00] a red horse rider another color another
[2:09:02] Ministry everyone God sent
[2:09:05] him now I I I wasn't there in the early
[2:09:09] church but took a bunch of cowards in an
[2:09:12] upper
[2:09:13] room and they were nothing in themselves
[2:09:16] but when the Holy Ghost came on them
[2:09:19] there was an anointing that came with it
[2:09:22] that they were no longer cowards they
[2:09:24] were as bold as
[2:09:27] lions and they went out and they didn't
[2:09:29] care what anybody said but that was an
[2:09:33] anointing that was on
[2:09:35] them now that wasn't the men that was
[2:09:37] the anointing that's right now it also
[2:09:42] went to the Dark Ages the ox
[2:09:45] anointing and now it looks like this is
[2:09:49] terrible they're just giving their Liv
[2:09:51] they they they're just but you know and
[2:09:54] you read some of those stories in Fox's
[2:09:56] book of Martyrs mothers giving their
[2:09:58] children being torn apart doing and and
[2:10:01] you think how in the world did they do
[2:10:03] that
[2:10:05] how but it was an anointing God
[2:10:09] sent are you with me I'm going really
[2:10:11] quickly on
[2:10:13] this
[2:10:15] now don't forget this church brother
[2:10:18] Bram was say fif seal and you brethren
[2:10:21] on tape I want you to examine this how
[2:10:23] could men do anything else beside the
[2:10:27] power of God that had been released to
[2:10:31] them I'm going to set this box up here
[2:10:34] to represent that if God sends a certain
[2:10:36] Spirit among them then the only thing
[2:10:38] they can work by is the spirit that
[2:10:41] works among them and I'll prove to you
[2:10:44] by the history of the church and by the
[2:10:46] opening of the seals and the powers that
[2:10:48] let loose watch exactly the Church
[2:10:52] responded to the anointing and they
[2:10:55] couldn't do nothing else amen now my
[2:10:58] goodness I don't know when I get over
[2:11:00] there and and I'm going to read about
[2:11:03] polycarp and I'm going to read about
[2:11:05] these Martyrs and and these different
[2:11:07] ones and I'm going to man how did you do
[2:11:09] it and he says we didn't do it God sent
[2:11:12] an
[2:11:13] anointing it wasn't us amen we just were
[2:11:16] faithful to the word and God gave us a
[2:11:19] power we didn't know we had yes sir
[2:11:25] somewhere beyond the caffeinated Pastor
[2:11:27] there was an anointing that came in
[2:11:31] there
[2:11:33] there here's a here's an interesting
[2:11:36] thing about a hundred years before
[2:11:38] Luther ever came there was a man named
[2:11:41] Yan
[2:11:42] hus and Yan hus he began to see some of
[2:11:45] the things in the Catholic church and he
[2:11:47] began to Pro protest them and he began
[2:11:50] to Pro protest them in such a way and he
[2:11:54] actually he began to do some of the very
[2:11:57] same doctrines that Luther would embark
[2:11:59] on but now hus was still under that man
[2:12:02] anointing sorry under that Ox anointing
[2:12:05] and when he did it they burned him at
[2:12:07] the
[2:12:08] stake now a 100 years later Here Comes
[2:12:11] Luther he's got some of the same
[2:12:13] principles he's near the same town that
[2:12:15] huses they're identifying his works but
[2:12:18] now the anointing has changed and Here
[2:12:21] Comes Luther and he is under a man
[2:12:23] anointing and they could not put him to
[2:12:26] death why it was the wisdom of man it
[2:12:29] was the power of God to the church that
[2:12:31] was there at that time thank you
[2:12:34] Lord friends if we can see how important
[2:12:37] that is and I'm coming to something so
[2:12:40] just stay with
[2:12:41] me we're going to be over there and you
[2:12:44] know what age did you come out of ah I
[2:12:48] came out of lead
[2:12:49] deia whole
[2:12:52] where the survivors are hey hear this
[2:12:55] guy's testimony how did you overcome I
[2:12:58] was faithful and God sent an anointing
[2:13:02] and the anointing kept me in the face of
[2:13:05] the most deceptive age that ever was
[2:13:09] friends we need to appreciate what we've
[2:13:13] got thank you
[2:13:17] Lord Brother
[2:13:19] brandom if you actually take first PLL
[2:13:21] and second
[2:13:23] pull they were actually under a man
[2:13:26] anointing he said our last great
[2:13:30] Reformation was
[2:13:32] Pentecost man
[2:13:34] anointing now everything brother Branham
[2:13:36] is looking at now
[2:13:39] remember the revelations
[2:13:41] distinguishes the lion the ox the man
[2:13:45] and then it says the Flying
[2:13:47] Eagle so brother Bram is seeing a
[2:13:52] transition and he is walking in the
[2:13:54] midst of this unfolding in his own life
[2:13:58] now hey God prepared him for it there's
[2:14:01] a bull across the field ah reach for my
[2:14:04] gun oh I don't have the
[2:14:07] gun you begin to
[2:14:10] exercise what Adam had in the Garden of
[2:14:13] Eden why because we're under a
[2:14:15] restoration not a Reformation but we're
[2:14:19] coming back to all that Adam lost
[2:14:22] friend Adam didn't control nature you
[2:14:24] know move the tree he didn't bring a
[2:14:26] bulldozer over he didn't you know some
[2:14:28] magic part he did it by the spoken word
[2:14:32] that's where we're coming back to and
[2:14:34] we're coming back and we need to see a
[2:14:36] distinction and I've I've been watching
[2:14:38] this and I'm going here is here's
[2:14:40] brother brandham first pull second pull
[2:14:42] now he's going into third pull and I'm
[2:14:45] seeing all of brother brandom has been
[2:14:47] spped Stripped Away the man part he
[2:14:50] talks about in the countdown he says
[2:14:52] we've gone beyond you know the horse and
[2:14:55] buggy age the automobile age the
[2:14:57] airplane age you know the airplane I you
[2:15:00] know you talk about people on Pentecost
[2:15:03] hey what' you guys do at church oh we
[2:15:05] were just in the Astronaut training
[2:15:07] program what' you guys do oh we went on
[2:15:09] a plane ride oh it was great we were up
[2:15:11] there and what' you guys do just
[2:15:13] preparing for one trip one final trip
[2:15:17] amen I'm waiting for the I'm under an
[2:15:19] anointing it is preparing me for
[2:15:22] something oh don't be don't ever lose
[2:15:24] patience what God is doing he's
[2:15:26] preparing us for
[2:15:29] something and so he's he's going and and
[2:15:32] brother Brandon would would take it and
[2:15:33] he actually goes down let me just bring
[2:15:35] this further he says now the Antichrist
[2:15:39] is cunning he's got all kinds of things
[2:15:41] that represents Christianity on this
[2:15:44] side or only got it off on the other
[2:15:47] side something against the original
[2:15:48] Doctrine something that makes him anti
[2:15:51] Christ see the reformers when the Beast
[2:15:54] went forth in a form of a man to combat
[2:15:57] that now so that was Luther that was
[2:16:01] Wesley that was Pentecost but look at
[2:16:04] what he says now don't forget this he
[2:16:07] says remember it all the days of your
[2:16:09] life these beasts are correct it's thus
[2:16:13] sayeth the Lord you can't take that man
[2:16:17] anointing that Beast to give you a true
[2:16:19] definition of where you came from
[2:16:21] neither can it give you a true
[2:16:23] definition of what the holy ghost is now
[2:16:26] am I throwing all that out the window no
[2:16:28] I still need justification I need I need
[2:16:30] sanctification I need what was there but
[2:16:33] now I'm moving beyond that I'm not
[2:16:35] throwing that away it's still part of it
[2:16:37] but I'm under a different anointing I'm
[2:16:40] not under the same thing
[2:16:42] anymore oh friends I I I need to just
[2:16:46] forgive me give me just a few minutes I
[2:16:47] need to there there's something here
[2:16:49] that friend said I believe is very
[2:16:51] pertinent to the hour we're living
[2:16:54] in yes sir it takes our
[2:16:57] approach where it's not in my hands
[2:17:00] that's right but it's God working
[2:17:01] through me thank you
[2:17:06] Lord sometimes it does US good to see
[2:17:08] where we're at let me just relax for a
[2:17:12] moment we went on on a trail I never
[2:17:14] heard of it
[2:17:15] before it's called The Devil's
[2:17:18] Bridge and I prayed Lord make a path
[2:17:21] path that we can cross the Devil's
[2:17:23] Bridge I won't tell you where I heard it
[2:17:25] but it was at church about where this
[2:17:28] thing was some people have told me they
[2:17:30] renamed it Angel's Landing so that's
[2:17:31] okay so I'm out there with my wife and I
[2:17:34] we hiked all the way up here the other
[2:17:35] day in Sedona and we come up to the top
[2:17:38] and there's a big photo opportunity and
[2:17:40] and it's it's like this a bridge of rock
[2:17:42] and there's a big hole underneath it and
[2:17:45] and people are out there and you can
[2:17:47] tell how vain somebody is by how long
[2:17:49] they're posing and doing things and and
[2:17:52] and anyway they're all out there so
[2:17:54] there's this elderly couple with us and
[2:17:56] and they're just standing there and they
[2:17:59] said uh hey you take a picture for us
[2:18:03] and I'll take a picture for you okay
[2:18:05] that's great they went out there they
[2:18:06] stood out there I I mean I've taken some
[2:18:09] photography so I took the whole Panorama
[2:18:11] like I took you know just the mountains
[2:18:13] the backdrop the whole could see their
[2:18:16] image then I took another closeup and
[2:18:18] another close-up another close-up I said
[2:18:20] oh this is great your grandchildren are
[2:18:22] going to love
[2:18:23] it and so then I said you going to take
[2:18:25] a picture of me sure come and take a
[2:18:27] picture I come back they're all
[2:18:30] close-ups there's not one picture of
[2:18:32] where I'm standing I go I'm going to
[2:18:35] have to photoshop this thing to show my
[2:18:38] children where I
[2:18:42] was sometimes it would do us good to see
[2:18:44] where we're
[2:18:45] standing every type in the Bible the
[2:18:49] Book of Ruth is not history that's me in
[2:18:52] there listen Esther is not history
[2:18:56] that's me in there Hallelujah if we
[2:18:59] could recognize where we're standing
[2:19:01] that's what the devil wants to keep you
[2:19:03] from but when you catch it oh friends
[2:19:06] that's the Invincible
[2:19:11] Army in the Old
[2:19:14] Testament you will
[2:19:17] find onethird of all the books in the
[2:19:19] Old Testament
[2:19:21] are
[2:19:22] dedicated to the restoration of
[2:19:26] Israel all of the Minor Prophets and the
[2:19:28] different ones and I'm just going to
[2:19:30] take a quick principle listen I don't
[2:19:32] didn't give you these scriptures but
[2:19:34] really quickly if you will Ezra chapter
[2:19:38] 1 now remember the
[2:19:41] restoration if I can tell you this way
[2:19:43] it was after 70
[2:19:45] years but it didn't happen all at
[2:19:48] once it happened over a period of time
[2:19:52] amen and this is a type for us I'm just
[2:19:54] stay with me I'm going to tie this in in
[2:19:56] a minute so in the first chapter I won't
[2:19:58] read them all Ezra 1
[2:20:01] 1:5 and it says about Cyrus the king now
[2:20:05] never I think Isaiah prophesied about
[2:20:07] Cyrus a hundred years before he ever
[2:20:09] came on can you why would God do it
[2:20:13] because God was drawing attention to it
[2:20:16] and so Cyrus this King of Persia he says
[2:20:19] now if there's any body of the kingdom
[2:20:21] of Babylon that wants to go back to
[2:20:23] Jerusalem for your God is God I'll help
[2:20:26] you I'll give you all the vessels I'll
[2:20:28] do all of those things I'll send you
[2:20:30] back so he does that and then in chapter
[2:20:33] three we find that they go back and Ezra
[2:20:35] was a priest so in chapter 3 you can
[2:20:38] read this in verses 10 to13 but they
[2:20:41] they went back and the builders laid the
[2:20:43] temple the foundation of the temple they
[2:20:46] they had a singing and everything and
[2:20:49] they rejoiced and there was was weeping
[2:20:51] the temple was
[2:20:53] restored the foundation rather was just
[2:20:56] restored oh they were so happy but then
[2:21:00] right away at that time what happens in
[2:21:02] in verse four when the adversaries hear
[2:21:05] about the temple being restored then
[2:21:07] they came to zerubabel and said you're
[2:21:10] not doing right now I'm not I'm not
[2:21:13] going to know but in in
[2:21:15] 4:4 and the PE and it says here and the
[2:21:18] people of the land weak weakened the
[2:21:21] hands of the people and troubled them in
[2:21:24] building and they hired counselors
[2:21:27] against them to frustrate their purpose
[2:21:29] all the days of Cyrus king of they hired
[2:21:32] somebody to frustrate them to weaken
[2:21:35] them friends that's exactly what the
[2:21:38] enemy is trying to do right now he knows
[2:21:40] that if we keep going the way we're
[2:21:42] going he is finished so he has an
[2:21:45] anointing on people listen people that
[2:21:47] were always there in the city right yeah
[2:21:50] H always there but wouldn't lay their
[2:21:54] hand but when they see the work Rising
[2:21:57] all of a sudden they're anointed and
[2:21:59] they're Anointed with something what are
[2:22:01] they anointed by to come
[2:22:04] against if you actually says the people
[2:22:07] of the land weakened them hired
[2:22:15] counselors just look around what's in B
[2:22:19] newspapers
[2:22:21] websites people that were Among Us what
[2:22:24] is the spirit that's behind these things
[2:22:28] and I just say they have no part in US
[2:22:31] neither are they part of this
[2:22:33] restoration and I say that's not going
[2:22:35] to stop us now the sad thing is back
[2:22:37] there if you look at
[2:22:39] history 19
[2:22:42] years there was nothing done on the P
[2:22:45] Temple because of this 19 years in the
[2:22:50] history
[2:22:51] now this is in Ezra 4 but you go to Ezra
[2:22:58] 5 you let's read the last Ezra 4: 24
[2:23:03] then cease the work of the house of God
[2:23:06] which is at Jerusalem it ceased in the
[2:23:08] second year of the reign of Darius of
[2:23:12] Persia but God is never going to let the
[2:23:16] work die amen so he says then the
[2:23:19] prophets he the prophet and Zachariah
[2:23:22] the son of Ido prophesied unto the Jews
[2:23:25] that were in Jerusalem in the name of
[2:23:27] the god even unto them and when they
[2:23:30] prophesied listen what did it do then
[2:23:33] zerubabel the son of of Shel and jeshua
[2:23:36] the son of Jack they began to build the
[2:23:39] house again and with them were the
[2:23:41] prophets of God helping them oh my
[2:23:45] goodness if you if you follow these two
[2:23:48] prophets through you know Zachariah was
[2:23:50] was the younger prophet he had the
[2:23:52] deeper things and and he would deal in
[2:23:55] symbols and and I see you know this and
[2:23:57] this and and and you know people may
[2:24:00] have gravitated oh I like to go to
[2:24:02] zachariah's Services they're just deeper
[2:24:04] than the others but then God has this
[2:24:07] old man hagy he's there and he just he
[2:24:10] tells him you know and hagy he says you
[2:24:13] guys are building your own houses and
[2:24:15] the house of God is laying dormant get
[2:24:16] with it amen oh that's kind of down to
[2:24:19] earth and blunt
[2:24:21] part of the same message that's right
[2:24:23] part of the same message these prophets
[2:24:26] were not to be separated they were part
[2:24:28] of the whole coming together of God H we
[2:24:32] need to hear about how our lives should
[2:24:34] be how our family should be how we
[2:24:37] should conduct ourselves in church as
[2:24:39] much as we need to hear God has called
[2:24:42] you for the foundation of the earth
[2:24:44] they're all part of the same work
[2:24:52] there's much I could say here but now
[2:24:55] finally the temple was
[2:24:57] built and it's really interesting to me
[2:25:02] God chooses to build the foundation
[2:25:04] build the temple but the
[2:25:07] walls are laying
[2:25:10] scattered
[2:25:12] now God has restored the word in our age
[2:25:17] and it's not up in some place in
[2:25:19] Jeffersonville it's not up somewhere
[2:25:22] it's to
[2:25:23] us but it's in our soul but the
[2:25:27] Battleground is in the walls of our
[2:25:31] spirit and sometimes the enemy can try
[2:25:34] to destroy what's in our soul by what we
[2:25:36] open up to right now in the Old
[2:25:40] Testament type here the temple is
[2:25:43] restored now what comes next is this guy
[2:25:45] named Nehemiah a cup Bearer in the house
[2:25:48] of the Lord and He there in Jerusalem
[2:25:51] now this is now I think the work had
[2:25:53] been undergoing 30 40 50 years and
[2:25:56] Nehemiah hears that the walls are down
[2:25:58] and as he hears this and he says they're
[2:26:00] burnt with fire and and and he just
[2:26:02] starts grieving and he going how can
[2:26:05] this
[2:26:06] be friends if brother Brandon would look
[2:26:08] at us he isn't worried so much all about
[2:26:11] how if the message is is being preached
[2:26:13] right but also how it's being lived in
[2:26:15] our homes how it is in when it comes
[2:26:18] down to a daily walk with God
[2:26:20] he wants to see it take life take root
[2:26:24] and I believe God wants to see it the
[2:26:26] same way so now Nehemiah he's just going
[2:26:30] oh God he repents and Lord be open to my
[2:26:33] prayer you've dealt corruptly with us oh
[2:26:36] God hear my
[2:26:38] prayer and the next verse chapter 2 he
[2:26:41] comes into the king's presence and for
[2:26:44] the first time he's
[2:26:45] sad and that was a dangerous thing to do
[2:26:48] at that time but as he come comes and
[2:26:50] the King says are you sick is there
[2:26:52] something wrong with you King I'm sorry
[2:26:56] but my father's sepers are lay waste and
[2:26:59] the gates are consumed and he says
[2:27:01] what's your request he says I prayed
[2:27:03] unto the god of heaven and he says oh
[2:27:06] King if your servant has found favor
[2:27:08] send me to Judah to the city of my
[2:27:10] father separer and the King said unto me
[2:27:13] verse six and I love this next part and
[2:27:15] the queen was also sitting beside him
[2:27:17] amen who was the queen sir who had had
[2:27:20] an influence friends Esther was a queen
[2:27:24] listen do you think that you have an
[2:27:25] influence listen you you you think that
[2:27:28] you're sitting here where you're sitting
[2:27:30] today you can have an influence you can
[2:27:32] encourage this is not just a oneman
[2:27:35] Ministry anymore now the work has to be
[2:27:38] completed everybody in their place
[2:27:41] everybody is doing something to
[2:27:43] encourage somebody
[2:27:50] and he
[2:27:51] says let letters be given to me and they
[2:27:55] that I can convey them and a letter to
[2:27:57] Assaf to the king's Forest that he can
[2:27:59] make he can make beams and Timbers and
[2:28:02] and all of these things and well
[2:28:04] wouldn't you know
[2:28:05] it the enemy is just going to let this
[2:28:09] go
[2:28:10] no just watch you get serious with God
[2:28:13] the enemy will come against you with but
[2:28:15] don't you look at that one moment am
[2:28:18] verse 10 when and San balot the horonite
[2:28:21] and Tobi the servant the ammonite heard
[2:28:23] of it it grieved them exceedingly that
[2:28:26] there was a man come to seek the welfare
[2:28:30] of the children of Israel oh God give us
[2:28:34] a heart like that that we can see it and
[2:28:36] the enemy has to notice these people are
[2:28:38] real
[2:28:41] amen it grieved
[2:28:44] them here's Nehemiah takes his horse by
[2:28:48] night he goes and looks at the gates
[2:28:50] didn't tell anybody what he's doing why
[2:28:51] he was there verse 19 no sorry Verse 18
[2:28:55] he he tells the elders that the hand of
[2:28:58] the Lord is in me the King has spoken
[2:28:59] words let us rise up and build so they
[2:29:02] strengthened their hands for this work
[2:29:03] verse 19 but when Sam balot the horite
[2:29:06] and toai the servant the amonite and
[2:29:08] gishian the Arabian heard it they
[2:29:09] laughed us to scorn and despised this
[2:29:12] why are you doing this will you rebel
[2:29:14] against The King and I answered them the
[2:29:17] god of Heaven he will prosper us
[2:29:19] therefore his servants will arise and
[2:29:21] build but you have no right no portion
[2:29:25] no Memorial in Jerusalem here's the
[2:29:27] thing these guys had been there for 20
[2:29:30] years that did not lifted a finger right
[2:29:32] but the minute somebody lifts a finger
[2:29:35] they get upset hallu oh my goodness I
[2:29:38] just say Lord I I want more of God I
[2:29:41] want to see this program not in my soul
[2:29:43] only but in my spirit in my family in
[2:29:46] the church around me
[2:29:58] Nehemiah chapter
[2:30:01] 4 and it came to pass that when Sam
[2:30:04] ballot heard that we builded the wall he
[2:30:05] was wroth and he took great
[2:30:08] indignation and he mocked the Jews and
[2:30:11] he spake before his Brethren the army of
[2:30:13] Samaran and said what do these feeble
[2:30:16] Jews will they fortify themselves will
[2:30:20] will they sacrifice will they make an
[2:30:22] end in a day will they revive the stones
[2:30:25] out of these heaps of rubbish which are
[2:30:28] burned and tobah the amonite was by us
[2:30:31] and he said even if they build if a fox
[2:30:33] go up he shall break down their stone
[2:30:36] wall can you hear the voice of the enemy
[2:30:38] back there can you hear the voice of the
[2:30:41] enemy here today he will try and stop
[2:30:43] you don't press in you it's not for you
[2:30:46] what do you mean it's not for me all the
[2:30:49] riches belong to me I'm under an eagle
[2:30:51] anointing the riches I'm not trying to
[2:30:55] pull myself up I want to see the real me
[2:30:58] I want to live the real
[2:31:04] me and in verse four Nehemiah says hear
[2:31:08] us our God for we are despised turn
[2:31:11] their reproach on their own head and
[2:31:13] give them their prey in the land of
[2:31:15] captivity cover not their iniquity let
[2:31:18] not their sin be blotted out for they
[2:31:19] have Pro provoked thee to anger the the
[2:31:22] builders so we built the wall and all
[2:31:24] the wall was joined together unto the
[2:31:26] half for the people had a mind to work
[2:31:30] the vision had to come to pass and it
[2:31:33] wasn't one giving in order but
[2:31:35] everybody's heart was the same just like
[2:31:37] brother Brandon when he was making the
[2:31:39] vision I couldn't tell that guy to move
[2:31:40] that hat he had to do it himself I'll
[2:31:43] tell you what when we get in one mind in
[2:31:45] one Accord and there'll be an army that
[2:31:47] is rising I believe it's rising even
[2:31:50] right now and I need to see every one of
[2:31:52] us in our place coming to this place if
[2:31:56] you want to have a purpose for 202 I
[2:31:59] want to see the walls built around my
[2:32:01] family I want to see the walls built
[2:32:04] around my spirit don't let me be
[2:32:06] involved in things that weaken me very
[2:32:10] good and I even say it this way if I can
[2:32:14] be so bold I'm getting a little
[2:32:16] older maybe I can say a few things now
[2:32:21] brother man makes a simple little
[2:32:22] statement you come up for a prayer line
[2:32:25] and he says to be prayed for thank God
[2:32:26] for that but if you keep coming up he
[2:32:30] says that weakens your faith that's
[2:32:33] right in perfect Faith he says to his
[2:32:37] church I want to
[2:32:39] see
[2:32:41] the how advanced my church is I'll do
[2:32:44] that in a few minutes and he has a
[2:32:47] prayer line but he doesn't stop and
[2:32:49] discern he just says perfect faith in
[2:32:52] God's word he lays hands he says may in
[2:32:55] God's name you be blessed May in Jesus
[2:32:57] name you be blessed he's watching
[2:32:59] friends there's a maturing we've got to
[2:33:01] come up to we can allow we can allow our
[2:33:04] faith to be weakened by retreating to
[2:33:06] what's comfortable even in a past
[2:33:09] age
[2:33:13] honestly I I I I I want to see God move
[2:33:17] as much as anything but I'm not going to
[2:33:18] work it up myself
[2:33:20] amen I want to see God do it that's
[2:33:24] right I want to lean on
[2:33:29] him we had a situation come up our
[2:33:33] church and I something a brother Harold
[2:33:36] had dealt with years
[2:33:37] ago and I thought I'm going to have to
[2:33:39] deal with
[2:33:40] this and I remember how brother Harold
[2:33:42] had dealt with it and dealt with it and
[2:33:43] it always came back up again and I'm
[2:33:46] driving about four four and a half hours
[2:33:48] coming back from a meeting
[2:33:51] and then I said I'm going to have to
[2:33:52] deal with this and then the Lord said to
[2:33:54] me just speak the word and I took
[2:33:58] several services and I just laid out the
[2:33:59] word and I'll tell you what that did
[2:34:02] more than I would have done with my own
[2:34:05] hand because there is nothing more
[2:34:07] powerful than God's word people came to
[2:34:10] me after said God really spoke to me
[2:34:13] thank you for that and I say that wasn't
[2:34:14] me that was the Lord that was the
[2:34:17] anointing that I'm under amen and I
[2:34:19] think we need to take it and employ it
[2:34:21] that way yes sir hey you have wayer
[2:34:23] children you're going to have to use
[2:34:25] wisdom you're going to have to allow
[2:34:28] them to give them let God deal with them
[2:34:31] help them but let God deal with them
[2:34:32] help them but let get God I'll tell you
[2:34:34] what it's not easy it is not easy but
[2:34:38] let God do a work amen now I want to
[2:34:40] point out one thing here I'm just about
[2:34:41] done
[2:34:43] here this whole
[2:34:45] battle by the time it was said and done
[2:34:48] there was not a SP a single spear that
[2:34:51] was
[2:34:52] thrown there was not even a a physical
[2:34:56] battle in any way it was a battle of the
[2:34:59] mind and now here when these two guys
[2:35:02] arise up Nehemiah says okay everybody's
[2:35:04] one mind he says now we're going to
[2:35:07] build the wall but your family you stay
[2:35:09] behind the wall and you be armed and you
[2:35:11] be ready and when the enemy sees it but
[2:35:14] they never had to do it amen why because
[2:35:17] they were of one mind they were one
[2:35:20] Accord the battle that we're fighting
[2:35:22] friends it's even Among Us sometimes
[2:35:25] yeah and I us just say like brother
[2:35:26] brandham said somebody sometimes he'll
[2:35:28] send somebody in among you do this and
[2:35:30] this he says don't don't make clicks
[2:35:33] don't do those things just love them if
[2:35:35] they're one of you they'll come in and
[2:35:36] join you if they're not they'll go out
[2:35:38] and do this you've heard it
[2:35:39] before where's our battle today I'll
[2:35:43] tell you what it's it's it is more
[2:35:44] subtle than we realize
[2:35:47] sometimes and he goes on to to say and
[2:35:50] if I just wind it down with this and in
[2:35:54] in verse 17 and they builded the wall
[2:35:56] they put their burdens everything they
[2:35:57] laided everyone put his hands in the in
[2:36:00] the work and everyone had one hand in
[2:36:02] the work and the other in the weapon wow
[2:36:05] one service of Hagi one service of
[2:36:10] Zachariah it's you got to keep your
[2:36:12] balance here and he says and the
[2:36:15] builders everyone had a sword girded by
[2:36:17] his side and so he build it and he that
[2:36:19] sounded the trumpet was by me and I said
[2:36:22] to the Nobles and the rulers to the rest
[2:36:23] of the work is great and large and we
[2:36:26] are separated in the wall far from one
[2:36:28] another when you hear a trumpet come
[2:36:30] over here and help us oh I like that
[2:36:33] don't you amen how many say I'm I'm
[2:36:36] going to be here for you Lord and if you
[2:36:39] send me somewhere just down the street
[2:36:41] or overseas or wherever I'm a part of
[2:36:44] this work listen I'm I'm done let's
[2:36:47] Stand Together how many are saying I'm a
[2:36:49] part of this I'm a part of this
[2:36:53] restoration I'm a part of this anointing
[2:36:56] I'm a part of what God is doing and I've
[2:36:59] got a position that I've got to fulfill
[2:37:02] Amen in the midst of this battle amen I
[2:37:06] believe that it's it's ours to
[2:37:08] take I I I want us to just say I'm I'm
[2:37:12] grateful I brother Harold hilderbrandt
[2:37:15] was my pastor for many years we watched
[2:37:17] him decline but I'm grateful he gave me
[2:37:19] a place allowed me to grow allowed me to
