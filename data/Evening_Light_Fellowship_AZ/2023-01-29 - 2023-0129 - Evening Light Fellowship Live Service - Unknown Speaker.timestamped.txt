[43:18] you would
[43:20] good morning everyone
[43:22] it's good to be here
[43:24] uh in my I feel like my second home
[43:28] it's good to be in a place you know you
[43:30] like to walk into
[43:32] a places sometimes you feel a little
[43:34] nervous which
[43:36] we always are and uh but a good drink of
[43:40] the Holy Spirit usually takes care of
[43:42] that
[43:43] you know they say the worldly performers
[43:46] nearly become drunks because every time
[43:49] they get to stand before people
[43:51] you know everyone views the spirit
[43:53] you're a different attraction and when
[43:56] you face them
[43:57] it takes an anointing
[44:00] many times to them it took a bottle or
[44:03] drugs to us it takes the Holy Spirit
[44:06] now once he comes then you don't feel
[44:07] that way and good to be here today and
[44:11] uh with the you know we got a Canadian
[44:14] bench sitting there right there
[44:16] Ryan and Jen and Abby and Noah flew in
[44:19] as well and Kim Nettie good to said he's
[44:22] good to see you there uh that's we need
[44:25] more Canadians here
[44:28] it's always good this is uh I want to
[44:30] sing a little song before we go to the
[44:33] word today and I'm always uh I'm Joy
[44:36] singing it's something that you're born
[44:38] with and uh you know I was when I was
[44:42] grew up a young boy I figured that uh I
[44:44] never did want to be a ball player I
[44:46] would like to play ball or hockey or
[44:48] things like that or be a sports person
[44:49] of some kind but I always wanted to be a
[44:52] singer
[44:54] and then I you'll say my heart out
[44:56] but there's nobody to listen I'm glad
[44:58] the first song I ever sang in from the
[45:00] people was for the Lord
[45:02] I never did start saying until we until
[45:04] I was born again filled with the spirit
[45:06] of God and then the songs are not just
[45:09] songs
[45:10] this Bible holds several chapters of
[45:14] Psalms that David wrote and Jesus
[45:15] referred to them all the scriptures
[45:18] referred to them from time to time
[45:19] they'd pick them out you ever notice how
[45:21] sometimes just when you really needed a
[45:23] Psalm jumps up
[45:24] said oh I remember what David said I
[45:27] walked through the valley of the shadow
[45:28] of death I'll fear no evil
[45:31] must have been anointed when he wrote
[45:32] that
[45:34] amen this little song I like it you know
[45:37] we have uh different songs we love and I
[45:40] sure appreciated the choir singing on
[45:41] the different specials Everyone is
[45:44] always expressing the same goal that we
[45:47] have
[45:48] we're trusting it all our roads and
[45:50] everything we do will end up in
[45:52] immortality in a body that we have here
[45:56] we have no continuing City but we keep
[45:59] singing about a city we keep reaching
[46:02] towards the city
[46:03] we keep watching the roads and we always
[46:06] know this song is simply called there
[46:08] are two robes
[46:11] and we're always we recognize that here
[46:13] comes the angel the messenger of this
[46:15] age and begins to take
[46:16] and begin to define those two roads very
[46:19] clearly
[46:20] one is a despised Road not too many
[46:23] people on that one
[46:25] the other one's the broad Road it's full
[46:27] of joy and fills all kinds of excitement
[46:29] here but it's aimed as death one is life
[46:32] one is death one is light one is
[46:34] Darkness
[46:36] and I was saying this and you helped me
[46:39] in the courses if you wish to because
[46:43] we're all a part of that
[46:45] [Music]
[46:46] there are two rules
[46:50] you can take
[46:54] one by side
[46:58] and one by faith
[47:02] take the word of God
[47:05] or what you see
[47:09] what you believe
[47:13] is what will be
[47:16] so set your way
[47:20] to The Winds of faith
[47:24] and you can fly
[47:27] [Music]
[47:28] to a higher place
[47:32] do not struggle
[47:36] it's by
[47:38] Grace
[47:39] set your wings
[47:43] to The Winds of Faith
[47:47] watch your name
[47:51] watch your cry
[47:55] watch your mountain
[47:58] is it much too high
[48:02] just speak the word of God
[48:05] and by and by
[48:09] it will move
[48:13] or you will fly so set your wings
[48:21] to The Winds of faith
[48:25] you can't fly
[48:28] to a higher place
[48:32] do not struggle
[48:36] for it's my faith
[48:40] set your wings
[48:43] to The Winds of faith I like this last
[48:47] verse because it takes it out of our
[48:49] hands

[49:22] for the power
[49:25] that makes him rise
[49:29] is already

[52:26] thank you
[52:28] brother I think I'll take
[52:30] well you got me hooked up all right
[52:33] good
[52:34] I
[52:37] was always this you know to get a little
[52:40] part that we wish to move into your
[52:42] heart is read or something and then uh
[52:45] move into the the thoughts but uh I
[52:48] would like to take and read a couple of
[52:50] scriptures if you would with me it's
[52:52] always in respect and of course I
[52:55] already had you be seated but uh since
[52:57] I'll I'll be reading a couple of them
[52:59] you just remain seated I think they got
[53:01] they got the
[53:04] I got it on the board I believe I'm
[53:05] gonna read Isaiah
[53:08] and uh
[53:11] I just want to entitle something this
[53:13] morning that was that I you know you
[53:14] hear Brother Brown say some things that
[53:16] strike you and then you go back to the
[53:19] Bible I've always believed this the
[53:20] prophet said Isaiah 45 is you're turning
[53:22] there
[53:24] he said we do not search the scripture
[53:26] to prove whether the prophet's right or
[53:27] wrong
[53:29] we go to read the scripture find out if
[53:31] our understanding is right or wrong
[53:33] we know God the word comes to the
[53:35] prophets
[53:36] we're not here to correct the prophet or
[53:38] sometimes people say well I don't
[53:39] believe it the way he said it that
[53:40] hasn't I don't whether I understand it
[53:43] or not I believe it the way he said it
[53:45] because I believe the word comes to the
[53:47] prophet to a prophet a Seer a word
[53:50] Prophet as we know we under that's under
[53:52] whose wings we are flying to stay and I
[53:55] do not believe I've heard people say
[53:56] well brother Brown was a little wrong
[53:57] there and he was a little wrong there
[53:58] now you all have to remember that the
[54:01] prophet like all prophets they grew in
[54:03] the grace of God as they understood and
[54:06] as the Lord unveiled more
[54:08] I've got just a little bit much treble
[54:10] up here or maybe too much Echo
[54:13] uh I'm sounding maybe I'm very loud I'll
[54:16] try to keep my voice down a little bit
[54:19] but I do believe that that as we
[54:21] understand the scriptures now from and
[54:24] I've been around for a few years now so
[54:25] I know that I've had the blessings of
[54:28] God
[54:29] to have been in this message for 57
[54:32] years or more
[54:33] and been been you know as a child and
[54:36] nurturing upward yeah just a little less
[54:38] on the on the monitor here yeah the
[54:41] floor monitors
[54:42] but I've seen it develop and you know
[54:45] how the prophet said even his own
[54:46] Ministry he said I used to think
[54:49] remember when he was like in the early
[54:50] years he said I used to think that God
[54:52] loved me but or Jesus loved me but God
[54:54] was my judge and always looked to see if
[54:57] I did something wrong he would condemn
[54:58] me but but Jesus loved me so one day I
[55:01] found out the same one
[55:03] so he said I got a different opinion of
[55:06] who I'm walking with and talking with
[55:07] and a different understanding
[55:09] that just because he changed his mask
[55:12] and the morphid god changed himself to
[55:15] fulfill certain portions of a scripture
[55:17] didn't make a different God the same God
[55:19] all the time
[55:21] under the law all the same God all the
[55:23] way through for four thousand years the
[55:25] same God just changed it in many forms
[55:27] and we're not going to go there but my
[55:29] my thought this morning is from the
[55:31] bosom of God
[55:32] and I I just it yeah you know the
[55:35] prophet makes interesting things but
[55:36] I'll read these scriptures first Isaiah
[55:38] 45 1-8
[55:41] thus saith the Lord to his anointed
[55:47] pardon me
[55:50] thus saith the Lord to his anointed
[55:53] to Cyrus whose right hand I have Holden
[55:57] to subdue Nations before him
[56:00] and I will loose his loins of Kings
[56:05] to open
[56:08] before him the two leave Gates
[56:12] and the gates shall not be shut I will
[56:15] go before thee and make the Crooked
[56:18] paths places straight I will break in
[56:21] pieces of the gates of Wrath and cut in
[56:24] sundered the bars of iron
[56:28] and I would give Thee the treasures of
[56:30] darkness and the hidden Riches of secret
[56:32] places
[56:35] that thou mayest know that I the Lord
[56:39] which called thee by thy name am the god
[56:42] of Israel
[56:43] I want you to notice here Cyrus is not
[56:46] even a believer he's a he's a king here
[56:48] now
[56:50] for Jacob my servant's sake and for
[56:52] Israel mine elect
[56:56] I have even called thee by thy name
[57:00] I have surname thee and thou Hast not
[57:04] known me
[57:06] God knew him but he didn't know he
[57:08] didn't know God
[57:09] I am the lord and there is none else and
[57:12] there's no God besides me I girded Thee
[57:15] and thou Hast
[57:17] not known
[57:18] me
[57:20] that they may know from the rising of
[57:23] sun and from the west and there is none
[57:26] beside me I am the lord and there is
[57:29] none else I formed the light and create
[57:33] Darkness I make peace
[57:35] and create evil
[57:37] I the Lord do all these things
[57:41] drop down ye Heavens from above and let
[57:45] the skies
[57:46] pour down righteousness let the Earth
[57:49] open and let them bring forth salvation
[57:51] and let righteousness spring up together
[57:54] I the Lord have created it
[57:57] I did that as a little background let's
[57:59] turn to Corinthians and I want to just
[58:01] last a couple of weeks well not her
[58:03] brother Ron and brother was the other
[58:05] brother perceived right yeah and they
[58:08] were talking about changing the language
[58:09] and and boy I sure and did enjoy those
[58:11] messages they just were good for me
[58:14] I I like it when it when it's just
[58:17] dovetails
[58:19] the sixth verse and I would I'm choosing
[58:22] just read a little something that
[58:23] brother Ron read here Wednesday night
[58:24] but I'm not going to take that thought
[58:26] but I'm just dropping in for a little uh
[58:29] background here before I open my thought
[58:31] now verse 6 of First Corinthians the
[58:34] 14th chapter verse 6. now Brethren if I
[58:37] come unto you speaking with tongues and
[58:39] I shall profit what shall I profit you
[58:41] except I speak to you either by
[58:44] Revelation or by knowledge or by
[58:46] prophecy or by Doctrine
[58:48] and I want to read those again
[58:52] except I speak to you either by
[58:54] revelation
[58:56] or by knowledge not man's knowledge but
[58:58] God's knowledge not Prophecies of my own
[59:01] thoughts but the actual word or by
[59:04] Doctrine and even things without
[59:05] life-giving sound whether pipe or harp
[59:09] except they give a distinction in the
[59:11] sounds
[59:13] how shall it be known what is piped or
[59:16] heart
[59:17] and we are very much familiar in life
[59:20] that there are so many things that have
[59:21] to be that way that in music for
[59:23] instance you notice that unless you
[59:25] strike an exact note
[59:27] of what is the sheet music
[59:30] the people won't know what song you're
[59:32] playing
[59:34] and uh
[59:36] for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[59:37] sound who shall prepare himself to the
[59:41] battle so like was he accept ye utter by
[59:43] the Tongue words easy to be understood
[59:48] that's good for all of us
[59:50] how shall it be known what is spoken
[59:53] for ye shall speak into the air there
[59:56] are it may be so many kinds of voices in
[59:59] the world and none of them is without
[1:00:01] signification therefore if I know not
[1:00:04] the meaning of the voice I shall be unto
[1:00:07] him that speaketh the Barbarian and he
[1:00:09] speak it shall be a barbarian unto me
[1:00:10] even so ye for as much as ye are zealous
[1:00:14] of spiritual gifts seek that she may
[1:00:16] excel in edifying of the church I want
[1:00:21] to just take that and use the part that
[1:00:24] that uh in conjunction with my thoughts
[1:00:27] here this morning is that
[1:00:29] all the things that God has done and is
[1:00:32] doing
[1:00:33] are all his thoughts expressed
[1:00:37] none other there's is there any great is
[1:00:40] there evil it's not the there's none
[1:00:43] else that is in charge
[1:00:46] God is supremely in charge of all things
[1:00:49] sometimes we get excited and we say oh
[1:00:51] it's going too long now I have to
[1:00:53] confess and I I I'll just let down my
[1:00:55] hair a little bit you know how it is we
[1:00:57] all have had our images of what we
[1:01:00] thought how this age would end
[1:01:02] uh brother Mike you've been around as
[1:01:03] long as I have and uh we were then the
[1:01:06] part of the last part of brother Bam's
[1:01:08] Ministry and uh so when the prophet off
[1:01:11] the scene
[1:01:13] and we heard the last part of his
[1:01:14] ministry for the last well 63 to 65. you
[1:01:18] ever listened to those everyone he ends
[1:01:20] with such urgency that we are about
[1:01:23] ready to walk off the earth without
[1:01:24] dying he just everything that he that he
[1:01:27] speaks
[1:01:30] that was a
[1:01:32] this is not working Utah oh
[1:01:37] really
[1:01:38] but everything that he said
[1:01:40] he was pointing to a a closing off of an
[1:01:43] era
[1:01:45] a finishing of civilization or of the
[1:01:47] book of redemption
[1:01:49] how that the redeeming part of God's
[1:01:52] great work that he's done for six
[1:01:54] thousand years of bringing man taken
[1:01:56] from the first part of the first time he
[1:01:58] slew an animal to cover man's Sin from
[1:02:01] that time he has labored and labored and
[1:02:04] brought himself and each time he did he
[1:02:06] expressing himself what's in him
[1:02:09] and who was in him
[1:02:11] not only what was in him but who was in
[1:02:13] it
[1:02:14] and where we come from and why we're
[1:02:16] here what are we doing here
[1:02:18] and that's always expressed that always
[1:02:19] excitement then I hear Brother Brown
[1:02:21] he's talked about yeah you know the the
[1:02:23] time when he's talking about the the uh
[1:02:25] the Dew Drop and said oh it's such a
[1:02:28] simple little thought but let me just
[1:02:29] read you something
[1:02:30] you've read it no doubt but uh
[1:02:33] I'm gonna get my notes
[1:02:37] yes um
[1:02:46] program says this in a little message
[1:02:48] called birth pains and he's talking to
[1:02:51] the assembly concerning some of the
[1:02:53] important things he said like a little
[1:02:54] Dew Drop where we take it so for granted
[1:02:56] he said but but what's the formula I
[1:02:58] said I'm I'm not a scientist it might
[1:03:00] just be a something like a congelling of
[1:03:02] group of atmosphere come together in a
[1:03:04] dark night and it falls on the earth and
[1:03:07] when it does
[1:03:08] it's born in the night
[1:03:12] but in the morning
[1:03:14] it lays there cold and shivering on a
[1:03:17] little blade of grass or hanging off the
[1:03:19] clothesline
[1:03:21] but just let the sun shine out once
[1:03:26] now there's a great message you could go
[1:03:28] in the morning get one of the greatest
[1:03:29] messages you could ever hear
[1:03:31] watch the dewfall
[1:03:32] watch it disappear where did it come
[1:03:35] from and where did it go to
[1:03:38] these are all that's that's just what I
[1:03:40] thought see too simple the prophet said
[1:03:43] most of the time our struggle is not to
[1:03:45] get through to God as we're not simply
[1:03:46] enough
[1:03:48] oh said but I we need to study in
[1:03:50] certain and that makes the weariness of
[1:03:52] the Mind much study makes a wish you
[1:03:55] study and you study and unless it's by
[1:03:57] Revelation it'll never dovetail
[1:04:00] you'll come up to blockage after
[1:04:01] blockage and you find it and refine this
[1:04:03] around this message not just because we
[1:04:05] listen to the message of the tapes do we
[1:04:07] have a revelation
[1:04:09] there's a many a person that listens to
[1:04:11] the message maybe on a good average
[1:04:12] point that doesn't mean that they have a
[1:04:14] revelation of God as it's devastating
[1:04:16] together you that or there wouldn't be
[1:04:17] any different doctrines if everyone
[1:04:20] could understand the message the moment
[1:04:21] they listened to it then
[1:04:24] it wouldn't be by revelation
[1:04:26] but it's up to God to reveal to whom he
[1:04:28] will
[1:04:29] and he does it that way listen to the
[1:04:31] little part that's where I got my I want
[1:04:32] to draw my text a little bit if I can
[1:04:34] then it then what but watch in the
[1:04:37] morning are they shivering and look like
[1:04:39] hang in there but just let the Sun get
[1:04:41] out once did you notice how happy it
[1:04:43] gets
[1:04:44] it just glistens and quivers why it
[1:04:47] knows
[1:04:48] that it's that sunlight is going to draw
[1:04:52] it back
[1:04:53] to where it was in the beginning
[1:04:56] now just watch what's what's what's this
[1:04:58] message all about to us
[1:05:00] it's drawing us back to where we were in
[1:05:03] the beginning
[1:05:04] it's drawing us back it tells you first
[1:05:06] thing you know when I heard brother by
[1:05:08] him say I'm not the son of Ella Branham
[1:05:12] Mom and Dad Charles and Ella Branham
[1:05:15] said I am a Son of God from the bosom of
[1:05:19] God
[1:05:20] and now manifest said we bypass the
[1:05:22] orphanage come directly to be tempted
[1:05:23] and tested here but it was his purpose
[1:05:26] that way
[1:05:27] now you know when Melchizedek was on
[1:05:29] Earth and uh when you know Elohim came
[1:05:32] to uh offer Abraham came to Abraham and
[1:05:35] said to him I'm going to keep my word to
[1:05:38] you
[1:05:39] now you're going to have that child you
[1:05:41] know the story brother bam talked about
[1:05:42] you know he could have right then give
[1:05:44] his life for the atoneer of sin
[1:05:47] he was a man he ate bread
[1:05:50] drank the milk had buttermilk brother
[1:05:52] Brown said sat down talk with Abram they
[1:05:55] cooked for him and he could have done
[1:05:57] right then
[1:05:59] he was in a human body
[1:06:01] but sin didn't come that way
[1:06:04] sin came through the womb and by
[1:06:06] relationship and he had to come the same
[1:06:09] way in order to cover that sin he
[1:06:11] couldn't come as God he had to come as
[1:06:12] man
[1:06:13] but it's all the time the same one
[1:06:15] wasn't a different one
[1:06:17] oh my listen how he finishes here why
[1:06:19] see oh it's so happy and everything and
[1:06:23] so is every man and woman that's born of
[1:06:25] the spirit of God there's something
[1:06:26] about it when light spreads over us and
[1:06:30] that
[1:06:31] that we're happy because we know that
[1:06:33] we're coming back to where we come from
[1:06:35] from the bosom of God
[1:06:38] we come back from the heart the soul of
[1:06:40] God we come back where we where we left
[1:06:43] off
[1:06:44] we we didn't know that we come from
[1:06:46] there until the Holy Spirit quickened us
[1:06:48] and made us a new creature
[1:06:52] in the book of Hebrews
[1:06:54] a little message the Hebrews
[1:06:56] that brother Brown takes uncovers some
[1:06:58] of these things so beautifully and
[1:07:00] anybody that's uh a study of the
[1:07:02] messages of the book of Hebrews they've
[1:07:04] been some of the most anchored
[1:07:07] how to Anchor the church and how to
[1:07:09] conduct ourselves how to can take care
[1:07:11] of things and as pastors know I went
[1:07:13] back to it many of the times and read it
[1:07:15] over again it wasn't the troubles come
[1:07:17] in churches or in the homes or what do
[1:07:19] you you go back to those book of Hebrews
[1:07:21] you find out God answers the questions
[1:07:23] of how to conduct ourselves and how to
[1:07:25] bring and how to be successfully walking
[1:07:28] with the Lord and keep sin out of the
[1:07:30] church out of the people and how to keep
[1:07:32] people on track with God Hebrews is one
[1:07:34] of the strongest areas out now others
[1:07:36] simply made it Greater but brother I'm
[1:07:38] talking a little about here said in the
[1:07:40] paragraph 590 and I want to take a
[1:07:42] little time on this if I can kind of my
[1:07:44] base
[1:07:45] he said in the veil he's talking about
[1:07:47] the human Veil he's reading
[1:07:49] um and I'll read this too
[1:07:51] Hebrews the sixth chapter
[1:07:55] we should give strong consolation who
[1:07:57] have fled for Refuge shall lay hold upon
[1:07:59] the Hope set before us
[1:08:02] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:08:04] Soul
[1:08:05] the hope
[1:08:07] the sworn oath of God we have as an
[1:08:10] anchor to the soul both sure and
[1:08:13] steadfast which entereth into that which
[1:08:15] is within the Veil
[1:08:17] he said let me just I might pass that
[1:08:19] the other day said let me just speak a
[1:08:20] little on the Veil The Veil is the flesh
[1:08:23] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[1:08:25] God
[1:08:27] as a Sunday good Sunday school lesson
[1:08:29] here
[1:08:31] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[1:08:33] God face to face in his church
[1:08:37] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[1:08:39] the Angels at their position this
[1:08:41] morning
[1:08:44] can you see your angel
[1:08:46] I can't see mine
[1:08:48] but I know he's there
[1:08:49] how do I know he said so
[1:08:52] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[1:08:53] him
[1:08:54] we are hid behind a veil and that Veil
[1:08:56] is the flesh we are Sons and Daughters
[1:08:58] of God we're in the presence of God the
[1:09:00] angels of God on camped around bounce
[1:09:02] that then fear him we're in the presence
[1:09:04] of God all the time
[1:09:07] because he said I'll never leave you nor
[1:09:09] forsake you but not only will I be with
[1:09:12] you but I'll be in you
[1:09:15] I'll be with you even unto the end
[1:09:18] but the veil of the flesh is what keeps
[1:09:21] us out of his presence
[1:09:24] but through the Soul and Spirit
[1:09:27] by our faith we know
[1:09:29] that he's watching us he is standing by
[1:09:32] here he's here now
[1:09:36] then he goes on to tell a little story
[1:09:37] about Nathan and and you know how and
[1:09:40] the syrians had him surrounded in the
[1:09:42] crumbs cry he said oh
[1:09:44] you were surrounded
[1:09:46] and uh tells a story about how you Hazel
[1:09:49] I was so excited and and Elijah said
[1:09:51] Lord just open his eyes
[1:09:54] and but they were the same one was a
[1:09:57] prophet I don't know if he saw him but
[1:09:59] he knew they were there
[1:10:01] but he said now I see them
[1:10:03] because I'm looking at the promised word
[1:10:05] and I know he said he'd never leave
[1:10:06] anybody even my physical eyes don't see
[1:10:08] him but I know he said it
[1:10:09] now if we could see every promise like
[1:10:11] that I'm talking to myself when you're
[1:10:13] sick if you see yourself already well
[1:10:16] now that's what brother Ram says he said
[1:10:17] if you're sick just Ari look at the
[1:10:20] promise say I'm I'm already well
[1:10:22] if you've got a need in something
[1:10:24] something you're going through some
[1:10:25] battle you're going already see it
[1:10:26] finished
[1:10:28] look if you're walking today and don't
[1:10:30] see it are a finished product that
[1:10:31] you've passed from death into life and
[1:10:33] you're just carrying out the will of God
[1:10:34] here in this life go look again
[1:10:37] look again find out it's there let him
[1:10:40] open your understanding your Revelation
[1:10:41] to you one time that you come from him
[1:10:43] and you're here on his on his journey
[1:10:44] you're here for purpose
[1:10:48] oh my
[1:10:52] God I need
[1:10:54] now here let me paragraph uh 596. here
[1:10:57] it is hold it tight the veil is what
[1:11:00] keeps us from living the way we should
[1:11:04] do you ever feel that way
[1:11:06] I wish I could live a better life for
[1:11:08] the Lord
[1:11:10] I wish I could be all the time so near
[1:11:12] with the Lord
[1:11:14] but let me drop a little something here
[1:11:15] that might help you
[1:11:18] in our present condition
[1:11:21] we can only take so much of God
[1:11:24] you know you've got to get up in the
[1:11:26] morning go to work
[1:11:29] your wife has to do things and your
[1:11:31] children have to go places
[1:11:33] well you have to leave him because you
[1:11:35] have to go and do your work
[1:11:37] many times you'd get pretty lonely
[1:11:40] but as long as this flashes that's why
[1:11:43] he gives us the Holy Ghost just a lick
[1:11:45] of Fire
[1:11:47] a tongues of Fire
[1:11:49] just enough
[1:11:50] to be the earnest
[1:11:53] the down payment the overcoming power
[1:11:56] above sin and unbelief and the only sin
[1:11:58] there really is is unbelief
[1:11:59] all the other things are just attributes
[1:12:01] of unbelief
[1:12:03] people you know sometimes say well I got
[1:12:05] this happen I got just get in Christ one
[1:12:07] time let it fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:08] The Habit will fall
[1:12:10] never have to worry about things falling
[1:12:12] off uh just let get into Christ
[1:12:15] and many times we get into the place
[1:12:17] where we're trying to solve how to get
[1:12:19] rid of the things without getting into
[1:12:21] Christ
[1:12:22] how to solve the problems in this church
[1:12:24] without the Holy Ghost doing it but the
[1:12:27] Holy Ghost will always work by the word
[1:12:28] just put them in put them in his place
[1:12:30] it'll accomplish what he sets it forth
[1:12:34] if God ever speaks anything
[1:12:36] it must come to pass just that way he
[1:12:39] cannot he cannot change his mind you
[1:12:40] know he's never had a better thought
[1:12:42] that always makes me feel good
[1:12:45] sometimes saying Lord I wish I was like
[1:12:47] soon so I was like this
[1:12:49] but it pleases him to be what you are
[1:12:53] and never let jealousy or count it out
[1:12:55] to get to the place to where you it
[1:12:56] would it hinders you just be who you are
[1:13:00] God loves you the best of course the
[1:13:02] worst thing we ever do is when we start
[1:13:03] copying then we see what we got in
[1:13:05] Hollywood here today everybody wants to
[1:13:07] act
[1:13:08] what somebody else is doing
[1:13:10] the actors want to play other people's
[1:13:12] parts
[1:13:14] until almost they get to feeling like
[1:13:15] they are the other people
[1:13:18] but they're still only acting
[1:13:21] see Christians don't act
[1:13:24] when you're born of the spirit of God we
[1:13:25] walk in the light for we are the lies
[1:13:29] listen how it continues here a little
[1:13:30] bit I I and uh
[1:13:33] because the Veil
[1:13:36] is what keeps us from doing the things
[1:13:37] that we want to do
[1:13:39] and God became veiled in flesh and the
[1:13:43] veil was torn in two
[1:13:46] and God became
[1:13:49] God again
[1:13:50] and it raised up the Veil
[1:13:53] that he hid himself in that's the
[1:13:55] resurrection of the Lord Jesus prove to
[1:13:58] us that in this Veil that we're living
[1:14:00] now today by faith we believe it and
[1:14:03] accept it and when this Veil is torn
[1:14:05] into
[1:14:07] I'll go in the presence of with the
[1:14:10] Assurance knowing that I know that my
[1:14:12] I know him in the power of Israel his
[1:14:15] resurrection at the coming of the Lord
[1:14:17] Jesus this Veil will be raised up again
[1:14:19] in Perfection way
[1:14:21] till I'll walk and I'll talk with him as
[1:14:24] my savior and my God
[1:14:26] we'll need a new body we'll need a new
[1:14:28] body to fellowship with him the way that
[1:14:30] we really are made to do
[1:14:31] but here we have the down payment of it
[1:14:34] and we walk in this and I I just want to
[1:14:36] let you know see when God was took
[1:14:37] himself even when he came you remember
[1:14:40] how when he when Paul on the way to the
[1:14:44] Masters to arrest the Christians
[1:14:46] and when he got struck down as we know
[1:14:48] the story real well when he got struck
[1:14:50] down by the pillar of fire he asked the
[1:14:52] question Lord who are you
[1:14:54] because he Jesus is the one he was
[1:14:56] persecuting
[1:14:58] but when he said the voice said I am
[1:15:00] Jesus he'd gone back to being God again
[1:15:04] but he was he already redeemed his work
[1:15:06] was finished on Earth he went back to
[1:15:07] being God again and when come and met
[1:15:09] him in the pillar of fire and when he
[1:15:11] went back to me and God again Paul said
[1:15:13] who are you said I'm Jesus and that now
[1:15:16] that shook up the whole itinerary that
[1:15:18] Paul had because everything that he ever
[1:15:20] learned about God
[1:15:21] everything had ever started and searched
[1:15:23] out now the very one he was persecuting
[1:15:26] was the one in the standard performed as
[1:15:28] a light
[1:15:30] now he got to know him by revelation
[1:15:33] and he didn't leave until he knew that
[1:15:36] he'd take the old and the new together
[1:15:37] and went away and studied it and and
[1:15:39] didn't study it by his mind he went to
[1:15:41] the Lord said Lord reveal this to me
[1:15:43] make it real to me you mean I came from
[1:15:46] you
[1:15:48] and now I'm here on Earth as your
[1:15:50] attribute yeah that's what I'm trying to
[1:15:52] tell you
[1:15:54] why did you believe it when you heard it
[1:15:57] why was there something inside of you
[1:15:59] that struck you there's another person
[1:16:00] sitting right next to you said I didn't
[1:16:02] see anything
[1:16:03] uh you could be right sounds good sounds
[1:16:06] reasonable but something inside of you
[1:16:08] stopped you in your tracks and changed
[1:16:09] your whole life around it altered my
[1:16:12] whole life always had plans of what I
[1:16:14] wanted to be last thing I want to be as
[1:16:16] a preacher I hated public speaking oh it
[1:16:18] was the worst thing if I'd go clean out
[1:16:21] the barn any day
[1:16:23] I had a day that just that but public
[1:16:27] speaking oh I was dreaded those things
[1:16:29] in school
[1:16:31] little did I realize never even thought
[1:16:33] of never even gave it a thought some
[1:16:34] people say oh I always wanted to be a
[1:16:35] preacher person I'd be lying if I said
[1:16:37] that I'd want to be a farmer I want to
[1:16:39] be anything else I want a Rancher a
[1:16:40] cowboy anything a singer or anything but
[1:16:42] I didn't want to be a preacher
[1:16:45] and now
[1:16:47] for 60 years
[1:16:50] 58 I've been behind the pulpit preaching
[1:16:53] the Good News
[1:16:55] it's good news to me
[1:16:59] and we'll live it goes on we live
[1:17:01] forever
[1:17:06] let me just drop past a little bit
[1:17:11] I need to finish that last part there in
[1:17:13] the present Assurance I know I'm in the
[1:17:15] power of his resurrection at the coming
[1:17:16] of the Lord Jesus this Veil will be
[1:17:19] raised up again in a perfected way till
[1:17:22] I'll walk and I'll talk with him as
[1:17:25] Savior and my God
[1:17:27] when he takes the Throne of David
[1:17:31] now we were talking a while ago about
[1:17:32] coming back here in the millennium
[1:17:35] then we'll walk and we'll talk with him
[1:17:37] because our bodies will be changed
[1:17:39] and we live forever in this Veil after
[1:17:42] it's been perfected
[1:17:44] but this veil has sin in it it doesn't
[1:17:47] matter I don't never think you'll be
[1:17:49] glorified body in this earth
[1:17:51] it's got to die
[1:17:53] same as your soul had to die to be born
[1:17:55] again
[1:17:56] and so many times and I want to just
[1:17:58] assure you and it's not not to assure
[1:18:01] you that go ahead you know well I I I
[1:18:03] want to do certain things but I feel
[1:18:05] they're wrong to do them
[1:18:08] you always will have that
[1:18:11] that's the that's the holy spirit in
[1:18:14] their
[1:18:15] telling you where to walk where not to
[1:18:17] walk
[1:18:18] and there's a little National part here
[1:18:20] uh it's kind of very simple
[1:18:23] but it's beautiful to me
[1:18:25] because I want your kids too too great
[1:18:27] uh I it leaves me but in the perfection
[1:18:31] he's talking about Hebrew said
[1:18:34] now let's walk away from let's go on to
[1:18:37] Perfection laying not laying again the
[1:18:39] foundation of laying on of hands and
[1:18:40] baptism so but now let's go on to the
[1:18:43] level where we know where we come from
[1:18:44] why we're here well let's go on to
[1:18:46] Perfection where you see who's doing the
[1:18:48] work and who's in control of the work
[1:18:51] that we're not in control say you got a
[1:18:53] nice congregation here
[1:18:56] but you've come in from everywhere and
[1:18:58] anywhere
[1:19:00] you're probably having people crossing
[1:19:01] the streets here to get here they could
[1:19:03] fill this whole place up three times if
[1:19:05] they would just come locally
[1:19:07] but you come from the East and the West
[1:19:09] the North and the South you've moved in
[1:19:10] you moved out everywhere you go to it's
[1:19:13] the same
[1:19:14] because it's by-election by the grace of
[1:19:17] God he calls me will but Perfection he
[1:19:19] said it's not eating meats and doing
[1:19:21] things in Perfection of the body you'll
[1:19:23] never have it
[1:19:25] and you've got to quit this and you've
[1:19:26] got to do this you've got to do that and
[1:19:27] do this that's law that's legalism we
[1:19:30] don't believe in the legal forms of
[1:19:32] Salvation no sir I don't
[1:19:35] We Believe
[1:19:36] it that by Grace we are saved
[1:19:39] and it's not you
[1:19:42] you have nothing to do with it it's God
[1:19:45] elected that does it God's election does
[1:19:47] it no man can come to me except my
[1:19:48] father draws them first all right that's
[1:19:50] all all Jesus come to do was to get
[1:19:52] those that the father foreknew and
[1:19:55] predestinated them before the foundation
[1:19:57] of the world to become the Sons and
[1:19:59] Daughters of God
[1:20:00] the very word that most religious hate
[1:20:02] is the predestination word of God makes
[1:20:04] us rejoice
[1:20:06] so real you know that you couldn't come
[1:20:08] unless God do you it's impossible for
[1:20:10] you to even come unless God draws you
[1:20:13] and if God draws you who's going to keep
[1:20:14] you from us
[1:20:16] amen
[1:20:17] not him that willeth or run it or him
[1:20:20] that willeth but God that short Mercy
[1:20:23] now I want to say that I don't think
[1:20:25] there was too many of us who are looking
[1:20:26] for God
[1:20:29] I wasn't
[1:20:31] and I'm you know I'm 80 now but I I was
[1:20:35] 18 and 16 too
[1:20:38] so when I was 16 and 18 uh I believed in
[1:20:42] God absolutely because I believe the
[1:20:44] Bible I don't know why but it's always
[1:20:46] something my parents read the Bible all
[1:20:47] the time they were Christians
[1:20:49] but I didn't realize that they were
[1:20:51] praying the way they were
[1:20:53] because you know you need a lot between
[1:20:54] 16 and 20. it's a bit of a rough area
[1:20:58] because your hormones start paying
[1:21:00] tricks on you
[1:21:02] and the only thing you see is some
[1:21:03] pretty girls somewhere
[1:21:05] and it's a fact or the loudest Muffler
[1:21:08] car or something like that
[1:21:10] you know this most powerful man I that
[1:21:12] that's what I wanted
[1:21:14] that's what I did
[1:21:17] and there's a little testimony but I say
[1:21:19] that until I found the right little lady
[1:21:21] who's sitting back there right now that
[1:21:23] we're married 60 years
[1:21:25] when I when I found that one
[1:21:28] suddenly the cars and everything started
[1:21:30] taking second second fiddle
[1:21:33] first thing you know they didn't mean
[1:21:35] quite as much
[1:21:36] and then the first baby come along and
[1:21:37] they met even less
[1:21:39] then the second one the third one
[1:21:41] then I wish I had something different
[1:21:44] and then the fourth one topped it all
[1:21:46] off and now that made us pop on Mama now
[1:21:48] we're now we're a great great yeah great
[1:21:51] grandparents are great grandparents and
[1:21:54] um well at least a great grandmother
[1:21:57] and she's always great
[1:22:02] I didn't mean that just to say that I
[1:22:04] really mean that
[1:22:05] you can't be married to somebody for 60
[1:22:07] years
[1:22:08] and put up with you
[1:22:11] you know everything that you are
[1:22:13] and still smiles and says I love you
[1:22:15] Just the Way You Are
[1:22:19] by November time I was talking to a
[1:22:21] couple you know during the last
[1:22:25] 45 years or as pastoring and 40. years
[1:22:30] you run into a lot of things
[1:22:32] that you don't talk all about but you
[1:22:35] you realize there's been many times and
[1:22:37] you come up to a a dead end and you
[1:22:39] unless you find the answer
[1:22:42] there's going to be a separation
[1:22:44] and uh I remember one time talking to a
[1:22:46] couple and I don't get too personal
[1:22:48] because I got some of my own
[1:22:49] congregation sitting here so
[1:22:52] but uh but there was a case a situation
[1:22:54] that that where she was trying to change
[1:22:57] her husband with everything that she had
[1:22:59] in her
[1:23:00] and I was talking after a while I began
[1:23:02] to notice that everything was about he
[1:23:04] needed to change he needs to change
[1:23:07] and I I finally I said now when you
[1:23:10] married him
[1:23:12] did you marry him with that in mind she
[1:23:14] said yes
[1:23:16] I said oh
[1:23:18] you're going to have trouble
[1:23:21] you started wrong to begin with
[1:23:25] that's what it is many times the problem
[1:23:29] with Christians is when they become a
[1:23:30] Christian they begin to read the Bible
[1:23:32] to change the meaning of the Bible
[1:23:34] to fit their desire
[1:23:37] to fit their conditions to fit their
[1:23:40] desires and their wants in life they
[1:23:42] want that they're trying to take they're
[1:23:44] trying to take this message and you find
[1:23:46] many times you talk to people that have
[1:23:48] a problem they're trying to shift the
[1:23:51] message so it'll fit their conditions
[1:23:54] and they never get Beyond it
[1:23:56] they stay there year after year and
[1:23:58] that's exactly what happens
[1:24:00] they pretty soon they have a shifted
[1:24:02] understanding of the word of God and
[1:24:04] it's not home sweet home anymore
[1:24:06] now I know we all have that we all like
[1:24:08] to see our spouse be a little different
[1:24:10] than we think well I didn't think it
[1:24:12] would be this bad I didn't think it
[1:24:13] would like that but a lot of it depends
[1:24:15] your attitude on it
[1:24:18] I find that also true your attitude
[1:24:21] towards the condition
[1:24:23] in God's word
[1:24:25] and many times we find ourselves when
[1:24:27] we're sick or unneed we get our place as
[1:24:31] a family and all of a sudden we meet a
[1:24:34] crisis you know it's that time that you
[1:24:37] don't want to change the word of God
[1:24:40] at that time that you want to say Lord
[1:24:42] God I want to believe it just the way
[1:24:43] you said it because I know it won't work
[1:24:45] unless it comes exactly the way you said
[1:24:48] it and meant it
[1:24:50] because if you claim anything contrary
[1:24:52] to the word of God you can run as far as
[1:24:55] you will it'll still meet you right
[1:24:57] there
[1:24:58] you've got to come back to where we left
[1:25:00] it if we get away from how many times
[1:25:02] have we backslid we buy you know we we
[1:25:04] know that we backside every day the
[1:25:06] prophet said
[1:25:08] why is it that every day we say Lord
[1:25:10] forgive me my trespasses even when I
[1:25:12] forgive those that trespass against me
[1:25:14] you can't go to bed at night or get up
[1:25:16] in the morning but would you think of
[1:25:17] Lord here's a new day
[1:25:19] Keep Me From Evil keep me from harm you
[1:25:21] haven't even got to the bathroom and
[1:25:22] already a thought will strike you
[1:25:24] where did that come from
[1:25:27] you're in a spirit world
[1:25:30] but let me just show you not him that
[1:25:31] runs him that willeth I'll hurry with
[1:25:33] this quickly I don't want to see it and
[1:25:35] haven't but here's what I like there's
[1:25:38] nothing not a thing in the world you did
[1:25:40] God by Grace save you and not you
[1:25:43] yourself if you do then you've got
[1:25:46] something to brag about
[1:25:48] well I tell you what bragging rights are
[1:25:50] pretty low and among our as we as
[1:25:52] believers
[1:25:54] because you're believing a message that
[1:25:57] is literally turning the hearts of the
[1:25:59] children back to the mind of God to
[1:26:01] literally walk off of the earth without
[1:26:03] dying you're the one people the one
[1:26:06] people that no other ages had the
[1:26:08] privilege of staying to that place for
[1:26:11] all other ages of falling asleep and I
[1:26:13] don't know we might many of us might
[1:26:14] fall asleep yet as we have
[1:26:16] but we'll be up first anyhow so then
[1:26:18] don't worry about that
[1:26:20] brother Mike we'll be up first if we go
[1:26:22] before anybody we'll be up first
[1:26:24] that's what the prophet said I'm that's
[1:26:26] why I believe the prophet's going back
[1:26:27] people say oh he's coming back yeah I
[1:26:29] believe that too
[1:26:30] I believe we'll stand with them too
[1:26:32] I believe we will be gathered around the
[1:26:34] inspiration of the of the voice of this
[1:26:36] last age for that voice carried right
[1:26:39] clear up into the millennium
[1:26:43] absolutely I believe that with all my
[1:26:45] heart there's many other ideas about
[1:26:47] that he has to come back and finish this
[1:26:48] and finish that and finish that
[1:26:50] but I have to confess myself I believe
[1:26:53] Rapture and condition and rapturing
[1:26:55] Faith lays on the tapes
[1:26:57] not on the tape in the voice of the age
[1:27:01] it lays there when it strikes you it
[1:27:04] settles the question
[1:27:05] listen here there's no Bragging all
[1:27:07] Praises goes to him it's him
[1:27:10] then
[1:27:12] he gives you that sure hope sworn by an
[1:27:16] oath of the impossibility for his
[1:27:19] children to ever be lost
[1:27:22] I said it goes on talking a little bit
[1:27:24] here and you know this paragraph nine
[1:27:26] five he goes on talk about making
[1:27:28] mistakes and so on he said now you'll
[1:27:30] make mistakes
[1:27:33] sin has passed from you
[1:27:35] but listen you'll make mistakes but he
[1:27:38] said God God will not get let's get by
[1:27:40] how many made mistakes in his life and
[1:27:42] you know God didn't let you get by with
[1:27:43] it
[1:27:44] oh yeah
[1:27:46] get ahead of God or get behind God I'd
[1:27:49] rather be behind God than ahead of him
[1:27:51] because I might be able to catch up but
[1:27:53] I'll tell you one thing you get ahead
[1:27:55] ahead of God and you get in trouble and
[1:27:57] even I heard brother Brown say last
[1:27:58] night did a little message you said I'm
[1:28:00] preaching here right now standing in
[1:28:02] that kind of condition where I've been
[1:28:03] ahead of God God told me to do a certain
[1:28:05] thing and I didn't do it
[1:28:07] he said I've been suffering and
[1:28:09] struggling here now for months on this
[1:28:10] he said and until I get that thing off
[1:28:12] my back until I go make the thing right
[1:28:15] you know when he went to India instead
[1:28:16] of Africa
[1:28:20] and the Lord took him aside and said I
[1:28:22] told you to go after the first I believe
[1:28:23] it was
[1:28:24] and they said oh but India is ready for
[1:28:25] it
[1:28:28] he said now listen to them
[1:28:30] he said and he told me distinctly before
[1:28:32] and give me Visions at all how the
[1:28:33] meetings would go he said I bypassed it
[1:28:36] he said and I have struggled he said I'm
[1:28:39] standing in the Pulpit right now I'm
[1:28:40] paying for it right now
[1:28:42] oh yes but that hasn't got one thing to
[1:28:45] do with your soul
[1:28:46] no sir listen he goes on saying now even
[1:28:49] our children he goes to the other part
[1:28:50] here see even our children when they're
[1:28:52] wrong and sometimes you've got to take
[1:28:53] them and take them behind the the barn
[1:28:56] as I remember my we had some of the best
[1:28:57] education we had out behind the barn
[1:29:00] I wasn't a fool no siree
[1:29:02] and I know my dad when he meant
[1:29:04] something my dad wasn't the one that
[1:29:05] counted not son if you do that one more
[1:29:07] time one
[1:29:09] two
[1:29:11] two and a half three my dad didn't count
[1:29:14] if you said men don't go do it usually
[1:29:17] didn't say go do it he said run and do
[1:29:19] it
[1:29:22] it meant exactly that
[1:29:24] it meant that
[1:29:26] today parents are struggling with the
[1:29:29] children to give them understanding what
[1:29:31] it means don't do that
[1:29:33] it means count to three
[1:29:37] hello counting is different than doing
[1:29:39] it
[1:29:40] do it
[1:29:42] and sometimes the hardest education and
[1:29:45] you know we got all the things we got
[1:29:46] politics and everything telling us don't
[1:29:49] even touch the children always said
[1:29:50] it'll it'll stunt their natural growth
[1:29:54] spiritual growth oh don't touch them
[1:29:56] well you you get around the word of God
[1:29:59] and you you broke the greatest promise
[1:30:02] there is
[1:30:03] train up a child in the way it's so cool
[1:30:06] and when it's old it'll not depart from
[1:30:08] it who will not depart from it the Holy
[1:30:09] Ghost will not depart from it because
[1:30:11] you've trained him by the word brother
[1:30:12] Bamford doesn't mean that the person
[1:30:14] won't get away but said God won't get
[1:30:15] away I got a daughter like that right
[1:30:17] now she's already 50 years old or more
[1:30:19] I'm still claiming this
[1:30:22] I got grandchildren coming I claiming it
[1:30:24] lay it right there thank God every day
[1:30:25] for the promise that I believe the
[1:30:27] promise
[1:30:29] you and your Offspring will be there
[1:30:31] but listen what I said certainly you'll
[1:30:33] make mistakes
[1:30:34] but still you're a child
[1:30:36] it's impossible for that man to ever be
[1:30:39] gone again
[1:30:40] that's once been born of eternal life
[1:30:44] God is not an Indian giver he that
[1:30:46] Hearth my word and believeth in him that
[1:30:47] sent me has everlasting life and shall
[1:30:49] never come into judgment but his past
[1:30:50] from death into life and I'll raise him
[1:30:52] up in the last day that's God's promise
[1:30:53] now if
[1:30:55] you go and say oh well then I'll just uh
[1:30:58] say I always do what I want to do
[1:31:02] but if you're a Christian you don't want
[1:31:04] to do the things that's wrong
[1:31:06] that's a good one to labor on a little
[1:31:07] bit that's the one thing the Holy Ghost
[1:31:10] takes from you is to want to
[1:31:12] that portion of the Holy Ghost when he
[1:31:14] comes into you takes the want to the sin
[1:31:16] to disbelieve God's word it takes to
[1:31:18] want to out you'll still be tested and
[1:31:20] tried in every way but to want to
[1:31:22] they want to but listen what he says it
[1:31:24] goes him a little further
[1:31:26] sometimes we get we condemn ourselves so
[1:31:28] much because
[1:31:29] we struggle with certain things
[1:31:31] we battle with certain things
[1:31:34] and especially as we're younger we think
[1:31:36] well we've got much hope because I'm
[1:31:38] still bothered with sir they're very
[1:31:39] natural things that you're bothering
[1:31:41] only train them rightly
[1:31:44] it is it is a fact that they that the
[1:31:47] desire of a man is to find a wife and
[1:31:49] vice versa
[1:31:51] but go about it God's way commit thy way
[1:31:54] to the Lord and he'll get you the right
[1:31:56] one
[1:31:57] that you won't have to sign divorce
[1:31:59] papers down the road
[1:32:01] because he didn't give God doesn't give
[1:32:03] marriages that just last for a season
[1:32:06] is till death do us part
[1:32:08] I like that
[1:32:10] he said but you don't want to do wrong
[1:32:12] he said but if you're a Christian you
[1:32:13] don't want to do wrong you don't want to
[1:32:15] do things that's wrong because the very
[1:32:16] life in you the very Fountain if you
[1:32:19] want to do wrong it shows that that
[1:32:22] shows that wrong thing is in here
[1:32:25] how can a bitter and a sweet Spirit or
[1:32:28] water come from the same Fountain so
[1:32:33] you've been all mixed up he said
[1:32:37] maybe buy some emotion or something
[1:32:38] something like that but forget it just
[1:32:40] go back to the altar of God hinteth what
[1:32:42] I like take God and say God take my old
[1:32:45] sinful life away and put
[1:32:48] put me in such a condition that my whole
[1:32:52] desire
[1:32:54] he that's born of God does not commit
[1:32:56] sin that's it
[1:32:58] he has no desire to do so certainly the
[1:33:02] devil will trap you here and there but
[1:33:04] not willingly the Bible says so the
[1:33:05] devil will trap now here and then say
[1:33:07] then I tried to throw the Trap uh he
[1:33:11] tries to throw this apartment
[1:33:12] he tried to throw the trap on Jesus
[1:33:15] he did it on Moses he caught him
[1:33:18] did on Peter he caught him
[1:33:21] but generous one he did it on Jesus he
[1:33:23] didn't catch him
[1:33:24] because he was the fullness of the
[1:33:26] godhead bodily he was our
[1:33:29] defense
[1:33:31] amen and caught him he did that and
[1:33:34] Peter even denied him and then he went
[1:33:36] and wept bitterly
[1:33:38] there was something in him
[1:33:40] that's the something we like to talk
[1:33:42] about all the time
[1:33:43] what makes you repent
[1:33:46] last quote him when
[1:33:48] the dove was turned out of the Ark the
[1:33:52] crow went out and called around
[1:33:55] he was in the art all right but when he
[1:33:59] went out his nature was different
[1:34:02] he could eat at the old dead carcass and
[1:34:04] he wanted to and be satisfied
[1:34:08] see he was a crow to begin with he was a
[1:34:10] scavenger
[1:34:11] he was no good
[1:34:13] he was a hypocrite
[1:34:16] why did he have him there
[1:34:19] he's the designer
[1:34:22] he's got everything made in its place
[1:34:27] he could fly anywhere the dove could fly
[1:34:29] and can eat what the dove could eat
[1:34:32] but the dove couldn't eat what he eat
[1:34:36] for the dove is a different makeup she's
[1:34:38] a different make she's a dove and the
[1:34:41] dove cannot
[1:34:42] digest rotten rotten food because
[1:34:46] it doesn't have a goal
[1:34:50] see the dove could fly out and they they
[1:34:55] Crow could fly to the same place
[1:34:57] it goes on a little further if you want
[1:34:58] to read that but he said if the dove
[1:35:01] accidentally dropped on a dead carcass
[1:35:04] said quickly it would leave
[1:35:07] and sometimes we drop down on a dead
[1:35:09] carcass
[1:35:12] but it is a fact
[1:35:14] that God in Christ are one it is a fact
[1:35:16] that God cannot if that desire of God is
[1:35:20] in you and you drop on some sinful thing
[1:35:22] sometimes unawares
[1:35:25] brother bam said you might he goes on to
[1:35:27] talk a little bit more he said you might
[1:35:29] go into a bar room sometime
[1:35:31] and quickly you realize oh what am I
[1:35:33] doing here
[1:35:35] you might go to some place sometimes
[1:35:37] where you often you find yourself in a
[1:35:38] condition that what oh my and quickly
[1:35:40] you get out of there
[1:35:42] why
[1:35:44] because it's that nature inside
[1:35:47] that holds to God's word
[1:35:50] see
[1:35:52] there are there are certain conditions
[1:35:54] and uh
[1:35:56] sometimes you know you you realize we
[1:35:59] are
[1:36:01] we're in the greatest battle
[1:36:03] has ever been fought by mankind
[1:36:07] yet we feel at times we feel quite at
[1:36:10] home say well we're like young people
[1:36:12] you've got your wife and family you're
[1:36:14] building your homes on brother bam said
[1:36:16] go on write it go on right on building
[1:36:17] do it do what you can what you do
[1:36:20] but never lose sight
[1:36:22] that the Rapture might be in the morning
[1:36:26] you're always
[1:36:27] we were coming home some time ago and
[1:36:29] this is just how sometimes God picks
[1:36:31] things up and just makes them makes them
[1:36:33] harmonious
[1:36:34] make sure they start dovetailing and uh
[1:36:37] I was uh
[1:36:39] driving along and Irene was a bit dozing
[1:36:41] we've been driving quite a while and so
[1:36:43] I I was uh I just stay awake I started
[1:36:45] singing quietly I said it shall be light
[1:36:49] about the evening time start singing
[1:36:52] the path to Glory you will surely find
[1:36:56] listen to the words of the song The
[1:36:57] Prophet sang so casually
[1:37:00] it shall be light about the evening time
[1:37:05] the path to Glory you will surely find
[1:37:10] in the Waterway is the light today
[1:37:14] buried in the precious name of Jesus
[1:37:16] Christ
[1:37:17] see the whole formula in one short
[1:37:19] little song
[1:37:21] young and old repent of all your sins
[1:37:24] the Holy Ghost will surely enter in
[1:37:29] for the evening light is come
[1:37:32] it is a fact that God and Christ are one
[1:37:37] then I kind of like a broken record I
[1:37:40] said it is a fact that God in Christ are
[1:37:43] one it is the fact that God and Christ
[1:37:45] it is a fact
[1:37:48] it is a fact
[1:37:50] that God in Christ on it is a fact that
[1:37:53] the seventh angel has sounded his
[1:37:54] message it is a fact that Jehovah the
[1:37:56] old is Jesus of the new it is a fact
[1:37:58] that there's a bride on the Earth right
[1:38:00] now
[1:38:01] she's word sell to word self to word
[1:38:03] shall she's taken on the word it is a
[1:38:04] fact that God is doing the work and no
[1:38:06] man is over her it is a fact that she
[1:38:08] has one head over that's the revealed
[1:38:10] Vindicated word for this hour it's the
[1:38:13] Vindication it is a fact that all the
[1:38:15] things that God's promises take past
[1:38:17] right now it is a fact that everything
[1:38:19] is done and the fact means it's
[1:38:20] something that's already done
[1:38:23] it is a fact
[1:38:25] is not going to be
[1:38:28] he's not going to add to it
[1:38:31] there's not going to be another
[1:38:32] messenger come up
[1:38:34] it is a fact that rapturing Faith lays
[1:38:37] in his Souls of people this very morning
[1:38:40] you're a human you walk right through
[1:38:41] the same you plow the same soul that the
[1:38:43] rest of them do but you're different
[1:38:44] people you're a new makeup God is quick
[1:38:46] and you made you alive you can never be
[1:38:48] a part of the world anymore it's
[1:38:50] impossible and I'm not saying that
[1:38:52] everyone's here but I pray that everyone
[1:38:53] will take that step and you young people
[1:38:56] don't worry about the things sometimes
[1:38:57] you feel like you've got problems and
[1:38:59] things like that that's good for you it
[1:39:01] it shakes you down makes you realize you
[1:39:03] either stand I've been there where you
[1:39:05] shook down so bad you think Lord God
[1:39:07] you've forsaken me
[1:39:09] Oh no just sometimes a little quieter a
[1:39:11] little longer because he wants to know
[1:39:13] how sincere you are
[1:39:14] but when you let down say Lord God
[1:39:16] whatever it takes
[1:39:18] to do thy will
[1:39:19] that's what I'll do whatever it takes
[1:39:21] bring me to that place no matter what
[1:39:23] the world thinks and what anybody thinks
[1:39:25] now when you die to yourself
[1:39:28] that's when you become alive in Christ
[1:39:29] because you cannot live until you die
[1:39:32] first there's no Resurrection unless
[1:39:34] there's a death first sometimes you
[1:39:36] wonder when you think of God why did he
[1:39:38] do it the way he did
[1:39:40] his whole purpose I love what the
[1:39:43] prophet said you know the people say oh
[1:39:44] predestination of that if that's the
[1:39:46] case he said then who can come who can
[1:39:47] you can't unless God calls you
[1:39:50] that's the gospel
[1:39:52] no man can come to me except my father
[1:39:54] draws him first
[1:39:57] so I don't like that
[1:39:59] God's not going to change his word for
[1:40:01] anybody
[1:40:02] see because he's the author
[1:40:04] and the finisher
[1:40:06] look at how he acted in this day so
[1:40:08] humbly so simply he sends a messenger
[1:40:11] and and calls around the world and sends
[1:40:14] a message have you I know you have but
[1:40:17] isn't it glorious how when the prophet
[1:40:18] went off the scene
[1:40:21] this message was hardly in any country
[1:40:24] in 1956 and prior brother Brown said oh
[1:40:28] he said if I could have just had
[1:40:29] preachers over there at that time that I
[1:40:31] could have said in order said but every
[1:40:33] one of those people 25 000 in one
[1:40:35] meeting and everyone gave their heart to
[1:40:37] the Lord and they they threw the idols
[1:40:39] and burnt them and and claimed that
[1:40:41] Jesus Christ was the god that they were
[1:40:42] going to follow all their Idols their
[1:40:44] heathens
[1:40:45] Idols they they destroyed them and burnt
[1:40:48] them
[1:40:49] he said well what happened
[1:40:51] they just drifted right back there was
[1:40:53] nobody to teach them and to lead them
[1:40:56] but you know what the last 50 years has
[1:40:57] done
[1:40:59] look at around the world I've been there
[1:41:01] there is churches message churches that
[1:41:03] believe in this message around the world
[1:41:05] they've got the tapes they got the books
[1:41:06] they're craving they're still craving
[1:41:07] for more books and so on they'll never
[1:41:09] be an answer to that craving because
[1:41:11] we'll never meet it all together but
[1:41:12] there's a bride around the world and and
[1:41:14] and we here in this nation we are here
[1:41:16] in this in in this well where the
[1:41:18] message came from you know what the
[1:41:20] prophet said and we'll be go we'll go
[1:41:22] right on plugging along sometimes until
[1:41:24] all the rest of the seeds around the
[1:41:26] world has come to maturity
[1:41:28] sometimes say oh there's going to be a
[1:41:29] Revival in the emotional Revival things
[1:41:31] like that going I tell you what I've
[1:41:32] been a Revival for 50 years
[1:41:34] this message revives me revives me
[1:41:37] revives me all the time I get away from
[1:41:38] it for a while and it revives me again
[1:41:40] pulls me back again and it never leaves
[1:41:42] it's just for glory to glory to glory
[1:41:44] but it always becomes more precious
[1:41:46] every time it revives said oh now I know
[1:41:48] I had to go through that Valley to get
[1:41:50] up to this mountain I see it different
[1:41:51] here now from glory to glory to glory
[1:41:54] and just keep on walking
[1:41:56] Keep On Walking
[1:41:58] and that the truth but like
[1:42:00] that's the truth I've been there where
[1:42:02] sometimes you think oh this doesn't seem
[1:42:04] to dovetail
[1:42:05] but wait a little while yeah just wait a
[1:42:08] little while just be patient with the
[1:42:09] Lord first thing you know it begins to
[1:42:11] fit in exactly why are you here in this
[1:42:14] area I'm telling my wife you know
[1:42:16] sometimes we come here and I've come
[1:42:18] here since 1969.
[1:42:20] when brother green had the first
[1:42:22] international meeting in Tucson
[1:42:27] and the Believers came and sang For the
[1:42:29] First Time
[1:42:30] in 1969 December meetings
[1:42:35] the first time we ever had an
[1:42:36] opportunity
[1:42:38] to sing
[1:42:39] to elect lady which we didn't even
[1:42:42] understand at the time
[1:42:45] you know when recently and I always
[1:42:47] wanted to sing it was something I wanted
[1:42:49] to do you know how God does things so
[1:42:51] sovereignty the first thing you know he
[1:42:52] said oh we've already done it
[1:42:55] oh I didn't know I didn't know we were
[1:42:57] doing it
[1:43:01] and I give a little testimony you know
[1:43:03] brother Brown said in 1949 when he was
[1:43:05] in Saskatchewan he went to Prince Albert
[1:43:07] 1956 pardon me
[1:43:09] and he was in Prince Albert and brother
[1:43:11] Ram was was preaching and then notice
[1:43:14] how the people there it was he called it
[1:43:16] the end of the world and from here and
[1:43:18] it's just Arctic well the roads have
[1:43:20] gotten further north now but
[1:43:22] but it's not the end of the world it's
[1:43:24] just the end of part of the world
[1:43:27] but when he talked over there he's like
[1:43:28] he's talking about all said these people
[1:43:30] like to sold their cow to get to the
[1:43:31] meetings they they said talk about
[1:43:33] sincerity and it begins to encourage
[1:43:35] them he said if you if you will take God
[1:43:37] at his word here he's speaking to the
[1:43:39] local people he said if you'll take God
[1:43:41] at his word
[1:43:43] said you're going to see a Saskatchewan
[1:43:45] Revival
[1:43:46] strike Saskatchewan that the people will
[1:43:49] come from around the world
[1:43:51] to see the Saskatchewan Revival
[1:43:54] now that means a little bit to me
[1:43:55] because I make that personal
[1:43:57] I live in Saskatchewan
[1:44:00] I want to be a part of that Revival
[1:44:02] first thing you know I found out I was a
[1:44:04] part of the Revival
[1:44:06] oh it's already gone yeah
[1:44:09] do you know what from
[1:44:11] 1970 to 1980 we had about 10 years of
[1:44:15] camp meeting every year
[1:44:17] and during those years I saw ministers
[1:44:20] come from every part of the world I mean
[1:44:23] every part of the world
[1:44:25] from Africa India
[1:44:27] New Zealand Australia Europe everywhere
[1:44:31] they came from around the world to see
[1:44:33] the Saskatchewan Revival
[1:44:35] later on another Minister coming to that
[1:44:36] area and I'm not criticizing I'm just
[1:44:38] saying you know hey one day he's he he's
[1:44:41] LED is led into that area and now
[1:44:43] everything's overrated it's now it's in
[1:44:44] the 2000s above that come in the area
[1:44:46] and and uh he's thinking about he's
[1:44:49] going to be a real revivalist in the
[1:44:51] area and strike the whole things and
[1:44:52] bring it back to what it was
[1:44:55] make sure and he ran across this quote
[1:44:58] and he's talking to preacher said oh
[1:45:00] there's going to be a Revival here in
[1:45:01] Saskatchewan they're going to come from
[1:45:02] all over the world to see it
[1:45:04] and I looked at him one day and I said
[1:45:06] you know what Sarah said uh that's good
[1:45:08] thinking
[1:45:10] but it says sorry pass
[1:45:13] said what do you mean
[1:45:15] I said you're looking at the
[1:45:17] Saskatchewan Revival
[1:45:19] I am the Welsh Revival
[1:45:21] I was the one that was born there I
[1:45:23] remember my dad
[1:45:25] getting for the first time and took the
[1:45:27] tapes home and started listening to
[1:45:28] tapes in 1957.
[1:45:30] we knew nothing about a messy we knew we
[1:45:32] just knew about Divine Healing but Dad
[1:45:34] took the tapes something inside of him
[1:45:36] struck and said it's got to be it's
[1:45:38] different than what I've heard till now
[1:45:39] we heard brother Bama in 1957 when he
[1:45:41] was when he was there for the meetings I
[1:45:44] was 15 years old young fella
[1:45:47] but I know from that time on something
[1:45:48] changed in our home or we didn't say big
[1:45:51] mountains and Thunders and Lightnings
[1:45:52] but little by little one seed was sewn
[1:45:54] another tape another book another
[1:45:56] message first thing you know it became
[1:45:59] the talk
[1:46:01] then it became a Revival and I began to
[1:46:03] see every Sunday and brother got there
[1:46:05] there's only three three four families
[1:46:06] and brother Gunther he started preaching
[1:46:08] what little he knew what little he'd
[1:46:10] read he'd take a little part we still
[1:46:11] didn't know it was a prophet
[1:46:14] but on a Revival began to break out and
[1:46:16] and in the village there's only one
[1:46:19] Village North of Saskatoon for 50 square
[1:46:22] miles
[1:46:24] and in that one little village
[1:46:26] the angel of the Lord touched down
[1:46:28] never struck another Village even to
[1:46:30] this very day not one more Village but
[1:46:32] that little village and saved about the
[1:46:34] half of the village
[1:46:35] and from out of that come a Revival that
[1:46:38] that up to 300 people and I remember at
[1:46:40] camp and he was up to 700 people all the
[1:46:42] way from uh all the way America brother
[1:46:44] green of course came as one and brother
[1:46:46] Vale came the different man at those
[1:46:48] time those times we all played in the
[1:46:49] same sandbox you know if you mention the
[1:46:52] name you're a prophet if you believe
[1:46:53] William Brown was a prophet said amen it
[1:46:55] didn't matter what they were you know
[1:46:56] all the brothers from here you know
[1:46:58] wherever you went to your brothers
[1:47:01] was until after the prophet off the
[1:47:02] scene we all started getting our own
[1:47:04] idea well I think he meant that no oh
[1:47:06] you weren't there I was there
[1:47:09] look I wasn't there when Jesus died but
[1:47:12] I believe it
[1:47:13] I wasn't there when Noah was there I
[1:47:16] wasn't there but I believe every one of
[1:47:17] those words just the way they're written
[1:47:19] I wasn't there many times but the one
[1:47:20] thing I was there
[1:47:22] when I saw the Revival being poured out
[1:47:24] and begin one after another
[1:47:26] began to get saved
[1:47:28] one by one be God begin to do things and
[1:47:31] and begin to you know it wasn't just we
[1:47:33] were all married at that time now
[1:47:34] remember we know nothing about the
[1:47:36] message
[1:47:37] when I married my wife we were both what
[1:47:39] we call nominal Christians
[1:47:42] I was 19 and she was 20 oh pardon me uh
[1:47:46] she would yeah well we were about the
[1:47:48] same age
[1:47:49] but
[1:47:52] so I had to look up to her a little bit
[1:47:57] well when we got married and this is
[1:47:59] just something I say to the glory of God
[1:48:01] you know God knows how
[1:48:03] how to make himself known to anyone
[1:48:06] and if you're a seed of God he knows
[1:48:08] just how to how to make it known to you
[1:48:11] what came to me this way
[1:48:13] and that's why brother Ram said I don't
[1:48:15] tell my experiences too much because
[1:48:16] people think the way I got it that you
[1:48:19] have to get it that same way oh no no he
[1:48:22] gives it sovereignty the way he wants to
[1:48:24] you're all different he gives it to you
[1:48:26] a different way and when he seals you
[1:48:27] into the kingdom you'll be a different
[1:48:28] emotional person you might be one's real
[1:48:30] high one's real low oh well that fella
[1:48:33] gets way too excited he doesn't get
[1:48:34] excited enough what's that got to do
[1:48:36] with it
[1:48:37] that's merely an expression
[1:48:40] you know what if you gave come up here
[1:48:41] and say drop down to give me a million
[1:48:43] dollars
[1:48:44] I wouldn't care how the fellow was
[1:48:46] dressed what he looked like
[1:48:48] what is what color he was would make any
[1:48:51] difference what had a degree uh what no
[1:48:53] matter what he was if he laid on a
[1:48:54] million dollars and gave it to me and I
[1:48:55] needed it
[1:48:57] I'd say well that's nice thank you very
[1:48:59] much
[1:49:00] are you kidding
[1:49:02] most of us Yahoo oh yeah and it's just a
[1:49:07] natural thing
[1:49:09] but you know what there was a million
[1:49:11] dollars just the same
[1:49:14] just the same
[1:49:15] that's why you never look at somebody
[1:49:17] else say well he acts this way she acts
[1:49:18] that way just let him act the way they
[1:49:20] want to act
[1:49:21] just be that way I don't know why God
[1:49:24] put my wife and I together but I know
[1:49:26] now I didn't know them
[1:49:27] you know what is love you don't know it
[1:49:30] was attraction yes could have been all
[1:49:31] it was but one day when we started
[1:49:34] walking together and the message begin
[1:49:35] to take a hold and I I'm taking too much
[1:49:37] time I'll I'll what's that time save
[1:49:39] there oh it's midnight already
[1:49:42] yeah
[1:49:44] but I got to give this testimony because
[1:49:45] the glory of God and make me you know it
[1:49:47] makes a minister so happy to see God
[1:49:51] do a miracle in your home that no one
[1:49:53] else can do
[1:49:55] now if you get sick and go to a doctor
[1:49:57] and maybe he can operate and then God
[1:49:59] still has to do the healing but who's
[1:50:01] going to heal the soul
[1:50:03] what school could you go to to give an
[1:50:06] operation on your soul today is give me
[1:50:07] give me eternal life
[1:50:09] there is one school
[1:50:11] it's called the school of God
[1:50:14] that he takes us and reveals himself to
[1:50:16] whom he will
[1:50:17] my wife was a good wife as she is
[1:50:21] the best one there is or I would have
[1:50:24] found someone else
[1:50:25] she's the best one doing this for me
[1:50:29] and we were we were happily married and
[1:50:32] the message began to I started just
[1:50:34] started listening to the message the
[1:50:35] tapes and we got a tape recorder we
[1:50:37] moved in and we made home and uh
[1:50:40] first thing you know for about three
[1:50:42] years first baby came
[1:50:44] and I kept listening the more I listened
[1:50:46] the more I began to put on you know the
[1:50:49] word began to put it on more and more I
[1:50:50] look at her I said you know what honey
[1:50:53] you're just thinking about cutting hair
[1:50:54] said you know you're going to stop
[1:50:56] cutting your hairs it's not right you
[1:50:58] know how the legalism
[1:50:59] and I'm sure I was pretty legal
[1:51:02] legally right
[1:51:05] but illegally by the Holy Spirit but I
[1:51:07] said you know what I think it's right I
[1:51:09] don't believe you should cut your hair
[1:51:10] she said all right
[1:51:13] and I think those pants those shorts
[1:51:14] they're gonna have to go yeah all right
[1:51:16] all right
[1:51:19] one by one she did them
[1:51:21] became subject but I knew it was never
[1:51:23] real to her
[1:51:25] when she'd hear she was well she was
[1:51:27] kind of
[1:51:27] excuse me honey but she she was a little
[1:51:30] more educated so when brother RAM used
[1:51:32] the Hanks and the totes and things like
[1:51:34] that well it you know it didn't sound so
[1:51:36] good
[1:51:38] but one day
[1:51:39] by The Sovereign Grace of God
[1:51:42] in 1965 when I was in brother Ram's
[1:51:45] meetings marriage and divorce series
[1:51:48] I was sitting oh well the Mark I was
[1:51:51] sitting about that far away as you are
[1:51:52] from brother Brandon when he's speaking
[1:51:54] and it was the series of
[1:51:58] this days of scripture were filled
[1:52:00] who was this melchized marriage and
[1:52:02] divorce
[1:52:03] and one night to one time you know in
[1:52:05] those meetings brother Brown didn't have
[1:52:07] prayer lines or may pray he just spent a
[1:52:10] little time on discernment a little bit
[1:52:11] and then he would take him off the off
[1:52:13] because he was preaching those series he
[1:52:16] didn't take time for The Healing
[1:52:17] Ministry well he
[1:52:20] when he asked us one night to pray I
[1:52:21] said oh this is the night the Lord's
[1:52:23] going to speak to me I was so sure that
[1:52:26] he speak to me he did speak to me but he
[1:52:29] didn't do it right then
[1:52:30] he heard my prayer but the prophet
[1:52:32] didn't speak back to me
[1:52:35] but if we left those meetings went home
[1:52:37] and shared with the family you know what
[1:52:39] God had done and so on all excited and
[1:52:43] and Christmas Day when the day that
[1:52:44] brother Brown died
[1:52:46] we got a phone call and and we were her
[1:52:49] the in-laws and phone rang and uh said
[1:52:52] it's for you meno and I took the phone
[1:52:54] and said uh my brother-in-law called and
[1:52:56] said
[1:52:57] uh brother Brown just died
[1:53:00] well you know brother Mike were you
[1:53:03] around during the time
[1:53:04] how many how many ever heard was anybody
[1:53:06] in brother Brown's meetings here
[1:53:08] oh yeah yeah good good good good well
[1:53:10] that's close enough in spirit he was
[1:53:13] that's good
[1:53:16] well well when we were when we were when
[1:53:19] we went to bed that night I said no you
[1:53:21] know honey
[1:53:23] I hope we see you tomorrow morning
[1:53:25] I already do
[1:53:27] because we believe that when the prophet
[1:53:28] went we were gone
[1:53:30] I might as well just confess it
[1:53:33] I did I said we're going
[1:53:36] you know and God in Sovereign Grace I
[1:53:39] can say this
[1:53:40] we had one of those prayer meetings you
[1:53:42] know the where God comes on the scene
[1:53:44] where he came on the scene that evening
[1:53:45] by the morning when we had come through
[1:53:48] and I won't go into detail but by the
[1:53:49] time we come through that in the morning
[1:53:51] when we headed home we briefly touched
[1:53:54] on these things and went by and that
[1:53:56] following week I think within one week
[1:53:59] I had to go to work that afternoon and
[1:54:01] and she was doing the ironing
[1:54:04] and she'd just give me some lunch and I
[1:54:06] was leaving around 3 30 to go to work
[1:54:07] working shift work and she said
[1:54:10] emotion she looked at me said
[1:54:12] honey
[1:54:14] I need to be re-baptized
[1:54:20] she was baptized I was in the titles of
[1:54:21] father son Holy Ghost
[1:54:24] and you know the water is a little hard
[1:54:27] in February
[1:54:28] in Canada so it was it was very very
[1:54:32] needful and she I said do you mean that
[1:54:35] she said with all my heart said I want
[1:54:36] to be baptized in the name
[1:54:39] of the father son Holy Ghost
[1:54:41] so I said all right I went off to work I
[1:54:45] said praying the Lord and where we're
[1:54:46] going to get water to baptize and we
[1:54:48] didn't know where we're going and we
[1:54:50] started talking and then we start
[1:54:51] Brothers we started talking one of my
[1:54:53] brother-in-law said you know what
[1:54:54] why don't we go to Jeffersonville
[1:54:56] I said oh that sounds good you're at
[1:54:59] that time
[1:55:00] everything was there in Jeffersonville
[1:55:03] now I don't condemn Jeffersonville any
[1:55:05] difference still the same place
[1:55:07] but God doesn't live in Jeffersonville
[1:55:09] or in Phoenix he lives in his people
[1:55:12] and he's got them around the world and
[1:55:14] there's no headquarters that God has but
[1:55:17] Christ himself
[1:55:18] and this Angel of the lord well we went
[1:55:21] over there and I I've got five more
[1:55:25] minutes
[1:55:29] there had been some confusion in the
[1:55:31] baptism somebody had come along and and
[1:55:33] uh the pastor at that time brother
[1:55:35] Gunther was he's a Believer they
[1:55:37] believed it all we knew that wasn't the
[1:55:39] titles but we didn't know the revelation
[1:55:41] of Father Son and Holy Spirit
[1:55:44] so one time in the course of baptism he
[1:55:47] was baptizing and there was a brother
[1:55:49] that said he was so excited he just
[1:55:51] heard the truth said oh he said today he
[1:55:53] said he said I'm going to be baptized in
[1:55:55] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:55:56] would just move it all over and one of
[1:55:58] the brothers said I wonder if one
[1:56:00] wonderful so we get down to the river
[1:56:02] and brother Gunther takes him in the
[1:56:04] water and when he's baptized him he said
[1:56:06] I baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:56:09] with a brother that that went down he
[1:56:11] all he heard was the Lord he thought it
[1:56:13] was the Lord Jesus Christ all he heard
[1:56:14] was Lord he comes out he's excited and
[1:56:17] the brother on the bank said Oh my he
[1:56:19] said I wanted to stop the pastor I said
[1:56:21] no no you didn't do it right do it again
[1:56:24] foreign
[1:56:25] and uh but he said I didn't have the
[1:56:27] nerve I felt so I felt so bad
[1:56:29] so we're sitting there that night in
[1:56:31] Jeffersonville Indiana Irene's going to
[1:56:32] be baptized the next next day and uh and
[1:56:35] big snowstorms coming into
[1:56:36] Jeffersonville so oh my so that service
[1:56:39] was canceled but we we got there that
[1:56:41] evening I believe it was and uh
[1:56:43] while we're sitting there that night one
[1:56:45] you know how God works in mysterious
[1:56:47] ways one of the brothers said brother
[1:56:49] Walter Rose by his name he said by the
[1:56:50] way brother man how were you baptized
[1:56:52] well I said what do you mean I was
[1:56:54] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:55] Christ he said did you hear it Wally
[1:56:58] well
[1:57:00] I think I did
[1:57:02] you mean and then he started telling me
[1:57:03] what happened he told me I'd never
[1:57:05] noticed it till then
[1:57:07] he said oh yes I've noticed and said
[1:57:08] then I talked to the pastor about it
[1:57:10] said I I don't believe it's right he
[1:57:12] should be baptized in the name which is
[1:57:14] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:57:16] well I said absolutely now I'll get this
[1:57:20] now I'm listening to him and I said
[1:57:22] wow he said are you sure I said you know
[1:57:25] what
[1:57:25] no sir I am no longer sure you just put
[1:57:28] a doubt in my heart
[1:57:30] now that isn't of the Lord
[1:57:32] now you know you can't get any further
[1:57:34] than that doubt
[1:57:35] and I said you know what I ha I don't
[1:57:37] know I said but I'll find out
[1:57:40] I said I'm going to go to prayer tonight
[1:57:42] when we go to our room we went to our
[1:57:44] room we Nelson prayed Irene and I she
[1:57:45] was going to be baptized and my sister
[1:57:47] and my brother-in-law and brother Walter
[1:57:49] and sister Marlene they were the six of
[1:57:51] us we traveled all the way to
[1:57:52] Jeffersonville and uh
[1:57:54] to be baptized for just for her
[1:57:58] so we went to the room and I prayed and
[1:58:02] I knew right there I had been seeking
[1:58:04] the Holy Ghost I was just a young
[1:58:05] Christian I knew I wasn't filled with
[1:58:07] the Holy Ghost you know when I was in
[1:58:08] the service I knew oh I said no I got it
[1:58:10] I got it now next day I made my mistake
[1:58:12] oh I guess I don't have it anymore
[1:58:14] oh I guess I lost it oh Lord give me the
[1:58:16] Holy Ghost
[1:58:18] sometimes we pray that way
[1:58:21] because we're not quite sure
[1:58:23] and I went and we prayed and I said Lord
[1:58:25] God
[1:58:26] that's simple
[1:58:28] we'll get this real quickly we'll settle
[1:58:30] it Lord now that I have a doubt we're
[1:58:32] going to take that doubt away first
[1:58:36] I told my wife I said I'm I'm baptizing
[1:58:38] too but we didn't say anything but we've
[1:58:41] talked to the six of us so we get there
[1:58:43] and brother Neville is in the in the
[1:58:45] pulpit and has come to the end of the
[1:58:47] service and brother Neville uh a godly
[1:58:51] man I just loved him
[1:58:52] and he said now we hope
[1:58:54] some candidates for baptism
[1:58:57] real soft like I said how many is there
[1:59:01] and all six of us got up
[1:59:05] I looked at them they looked at me yeah
[1:59:06] you too yeah me too all right
[1:59:10] brother man and brother wheeler baptized
[1:59:12] Irene and I and the rest of them in the
[1:59:14] name of the Lord Jesus Christ well I
[1:59:17] knew I was a candidate for the Holy
[1:59:18] Ghost after that as in now Satan you've
[1:59:21] lost and here come the Holy Spirit
[1:59:23] absolutely filled me with the Holy Ghost
[1:59:24] I tell you what when we come out of that
[1:59:26] water and I say this between
[1:59:27] Jeffersonville and Indianapolis how far
[1:59:30] is that Brother John
[1:59:32] foreign
[1:59:37] I don't know who did the driving
[1:59:39] but all six of us were so in the spirit
[1:59:41] we shouted we sang We screamed and I
[1:59:43] announced my own brother-in-law he was
[1:59:44] driving he had both hands in the air
[1:59:45] I don't know what happened but we slowed
[1:59:48] down for Indianapolis
[1:59:50] everything God got quiet
[1:59:52] but everyone was filled with the Holy
[1:59:54] Ghost when he come out of there and I
[1:59:56] and I know from that time from that time
[1:59:59] Satan had lost the battle
[2:00:02] okay and when God made it real to her it
[2:00:05] also triggered something to me and
[2:00:07] settle it when we come back home now you
[2:00:08] now you know what happens I'm a pastor
[2:00:10] now and usually when where the wind
[2:00:13] reaches the storm it reaches home before
[2:00:15] you get there
[2:00:17] and uh it before we even got home
[2:00:21] now someone had not even baptized yet at
[2:00:23] all in those days you know it was just
[2:00:24] to try out some of you Elders know what
[2:00:26] I'm talking about some are holding on
[2:00:27] and said well I I think I write I had
[2:00:29] the Holy Ghost and I spoke in tongues I
[2:00:31] believe I got it
[2:00:33] and uh somebody got home and told one
[2:00:35] told the village we lived in the city
[2:00:37] about 30 miles away and so we were going
[2:00:39] to go there for the weekend so when we
[2:00:40] by the time we come home the village
[2:00:42] already brother Gunther and the deacons
[2:00:43] they already knew that we had come up
[2:00:45] with a new baptism
[2:00:54] all this false Doctrine coming in went
[2:00:56] to Jeffersonville picked up some false
[2:00:57] spirit
[2:00:59] when I came home of course my
[2:01:00] brother-in-law he talked to my dad and
[2:01:02] he said now I'm not going to bother you
[2:01:04] I said uh but wait till Manuel gets home
[2:01:06] he's gonna I mean he's gonna hear from
[2:01:08] me
[2:01:09] so when I got home I he said where's Dad
[2:01:12] he's always in the barn I said all right
[2:01:13] well went to the barn and I walked in
[2:01:15] and said he greeted me and said hello
[2:01:16] how are you doing he said what have you
[2:01:18] done
[2:01:19] I was already a married man I still
[2:01:21] respected him
[2:01:23] I said what
[2:01:24] well you you were baptized already
[2:01:27] before I could even explain it you know
[2:01:29] he was demanding an answer
[2:01:32] I said Dad I'd like to explain it to you
[2:01:35] but before we do
[2:01:37] you haven't even baptized at all
[2:01:40] I said you still got that old title
[2:01:42] baptism I said before you go any further
[2:01:44] I said why don't you get baptized first
[2:01:46] and then we'll talk about this
[2:01:49] yeah yeah he said I know why no yeah of
[2:01:52] the end of the argument
[2:01:54] but I'll show you how God works in
[2:01:56] mysterious ways that why that Revival
[2:01:58] that I'm talking about
[2:02:00] that spring
[2:02:01] the complete Church says about 80 68 to
[2:02:05] 80. I forget exactly the number of
[2:02:06] people they all went to Eagle Creek
[2:02:11] and Jesse Taylor was baptized
[2:02:14] this time he went under for the Lord
[2:02:16] you know the song
[2:02:20] this time and from that
[2:02:22] it was settled forever every time the
[2:02:24] past runs so now I baptize you in the
[2:02:26] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:02:28] the Revelation strikes it becomes real
[2:02:31] ity amen God bless you
[2:02:34] it shall be light about the evening time
[2:02:38] the path to Glory you will surely find
[2:02:42] in the Waterway here's the light today
[2:02:46] buried in the precious name of Jesus
[2:02:50] young and old repent of all your sins
[2:02:53] the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the
[2:02:58] evening light has come here's a fact
[2:03:01] that God in Christ are one and that
[2:03:05] beautiful when the Lord began to show us
[2:03:06] not a Trinidadian Doctrine not a Oneness
[2:03:10] not a Tunis some have tried to make it a
[2:03:12] Tunis around this message don't get away
[2:03:14] from the Triune being of God he does all
[2:03:16] things in three
[2:03:18] but he is one
[2:03:19] he said I don't understand it if the
[2:03:21] universe says they do understand it that
[2:03:23] means you understand God's mechanics
[2:03:25] how do you understand the mechanics of
[2:03:27] God he speaks it and it is
[2:03:30] who is what scientists can break down
[2:03:32] the spoken word being the original seat
[2:03:35] you can't
[2:03:37] it's all Beyond us
[2:03:39] but by faith we know it's the truth
[2:03:43] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[2:03:47] there is a source you're going to play
[2:03:50] that for me
[2:03:51] I'm going to close in one song If you if
[2:03:53] it's all right with you brother
[2:03:56] there's a source and time of need
[2:03:59] I like that
[2:04:01] I don't know what your need is today
[2:04:03] but whatever it is there is a source
[2:04:07] Jesus Christ is that source
[2:04:10] I have just I'm here at the first time
[2:04:12] I'm I'm a little vacation because I just
[2:04:16] stepped down from being pastor and
[2:04:18] brother Dwayne by the way I talked to
[2:04:19] him this morning brother Dwayne and
[2:04:20] Connie they sent
[2:04:23] the greetings
[2:04:24] to the in-laws and
[2:04:26] ex-laws Outlaws
[2:04:28] they said hello to everybody brother
[2:04:31] Dwayne I know he'd like to be here too
[2:04:34] I I don't like to call him too much
[2:04:36] because I don't tell about how nice the
[2:04:38] weather is even though it is cool but
[2:04:39] not to us it isn't cool it's nice
[2:04:44] but
[2:04:45] I don't know what the Lord's got from
[2:04:47] here
[2:04:49] I probably won't be preaching much more
[2:04:50] anymore but one thing is true
[2:04:53] there's a reward that lays just beyond
[2:04:55] this this journey here
[2:04:57] I'm so thankful that God is just not
[2:05:01] a part-time God is on the scene always
[2:05:06] there is a source
[2:05:09] in time of day
[2:05:13] it gives you strength
[2:05:17] it brings me peace
[2:05:21] through every trial
[2:05:25] through everything
[2:05:29] My Savior stands
[2:05:33] in my defense
[2:05:36] so when the road you walk
[2:05:41] leave you tired and warm
[2:05:45] and your strength is gone
[2:05:47] [Music]
[2:05:48] and your heart is torn

[2:06:00] take her reach for
[2:06:03] the battle is the Lord
[2:06:08] and when the waters rise
[2:06:12] he'll call your name
[2:06:15] I bet you come
[2:06:20] out on the way
[2:06:22] [Music]

[2:06:27] lest I Should Fall water and bits May
[2:06:33] Come
[2:06:35] out on the water sing it with me so when
[2:06:40] the road you are why don't we stand
[2:06:43] leaves you tired and warm

[2:07:49] remember he's a great great Shepherd
[2:07:53] he wants your fellowship more than
[2:07:55] anything more than we want his
[2:07:57] whatsoever you desire When you pray the
