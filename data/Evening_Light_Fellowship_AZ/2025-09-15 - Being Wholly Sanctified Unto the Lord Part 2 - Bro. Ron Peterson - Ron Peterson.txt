God bless you." You can be seated for a moment this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Just have a couple things here I'd like to share with you this morning here before we start our service. As you all know, here in America, we had a a tragedy just last week. &gt;&gt; It's upon us. &gt;&gt; Darkness is covering the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; In gross darkness, the people. Now, brother Brandham actually believed that he would get shot from the pulpit. &gt;&gt; They're going to share with you a few things. Even as brother Renham in the mid50s while he was overseas, he had brethren and German guards that surrounded him and kept his head down and they ushered him in and out of meetings. &gt;&gt; Wow. because of death threats saying &gt;&gt; that they're going to shoot him with a scope at night uh at a long distance or whatever &gt;&gt; and we are in the midst. Brother Bram said, "Now watch." He said, "Don't fear communism." &gt;&gt; You know, people are talking about Putin and and Kim Jong-un and the different powers. He said, "Now watch those isms are going to come together." &gt;&gt; Okay? And he said, "Don't fear." He said, "Communism would actually take over without firing a shot." Said, "How will they do it? They're going to take your young." &gt;&gt; Amen. He said what is causing it? &gt;&gt; The colleges &gt;&gt; and the higher educated people. &gt;&gt; You young people that are in anywhere from grade school, high school &gt;&gt; and the university, &gt;&gt; it is from the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And understand that it is a radicalization. that is coming against not only the Jews, anti-semitic, &gt;&gt; but against Christians. &gt;&gt; And we've got to be aware of that. &gt;&gt; Uh you heard just last week, I think 89 Christian people killed in Mosmb beek &gt;&gt; at a funeral for one of their church members. And they just went there. uh local jihadists went ahead and just massacred all the people. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And just a few weeks before that in Congo, they had killed about 47 people also that had gone to church and then they burnt the building also. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um, you see here in America the killing of children &gt;&gt; while they're in church &gt;&gt; praying &gt;&gt; and the spirit was we want to kill the young and we we see these things and I don't want to elaborate on that but there was a man by the name of uh Charlie Kirk who was just a voice trying to stand for what is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And biblical principles and he didn't mind having uh a debate or to share his viewpoint and you know uh the people would get quite adamant and against him and they said he was divisive. No, he wasn't. &gt;&gt; He let them people talk. &gt;&gt; He he his thing was prove me wrong. He had the right attitude. All, you know, uh, some of them would just get so blatantly angry and everything and you're judging. No, I'm not judging you. Here's what the word says. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you that Satan does not care. &gt;&gt; Uh, when you use the word, he gets upset. &gt;&gt; That's why when God sends a prophet &gt;&gt; in this hour, he returns you back to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Back to uh what God has spoken. Now, I wanted to show you just a couple quotes. And if the brethren are ready, I've got the thumbs up. We're going to Can we show it on the overhead and hear the quote also? Okay. So, I want you to see 1956 and listen to what brother Brennham says here. watching it through the different nations throughout the world. I've come this issue get into a communistic country where I've had to be I've had to have people with rifles to keep the crowds back and I've had to have people that were soldiers that have had to duck my head down and mill around me to keep getting shot so they get me out into somewhere into the darkness where they couldn't see to shoot me at and things like that. Preaching the gospel, bringing good tidings of great joy of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And then it's it's marvelous to know that Jesus in the midst of all of that just sweet &gt;&gt; and just nothing alarming about it. Just taking a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just taking a message. &gt;&gt; We're packing that same message. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not going to make you popular. Some will hate you. Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "You'll be hated without a cause. If they hated me, &gt;&gt; remember it was the religious, &gt;&gt; religion's a covering, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not just a church. It's a covering. It can be far left, far right, it doesn't matter. It's &gt;&gt; a religion. And when you disagree with somebody, now the prophet said, "We can disagree. Disagree vehemently." &gt;&gt; But in the backyard, we can fight, but in the front yard, we're brethren. &gt;&gt; We don't have a right to sit there. It was Cain &gt;&gt; that killed Abel. &gt;&gt; Because of a righteous revelation. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, we can see that these things are happening around us. We're in the midst of it. Do we have the next quote here? Would you be willing to be a martyr for him? Aaron, &gt;&gt; if it come to the spot that you had to face death or take it back, would you face it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. It would be a pleasure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where I want to go. Right in the pulpit. That's right. &gt;&gt; I thought I got it and he was going to get it in Germany here not long ago. Oh, they was going to shoot me through a night scope and German soldiers run all around and help back like that. I thought what a wonderful thing it would be to die for my Lord right here on the field. Oh, what a what a wonderful thing. &gt;&gt; Now straight to the heart. &gt;&gt; All right, we'll go. &gt;&gt; Hard to make. Some of these days they'll be shot for it. But remember this that the churches are being bewitched for this ecumenical council. He's taking it right into it to say you're the same group. You're not the same group. &gt;&gt; Come out from among that stuff and be separated. It certainly is. &gt;&gt; It's true. We keep away from that stuff as far as you can from it. &gt;&gt; Watching it. &gt;&gt; So you can see brother Brenamman is pointing to a spirit, &gt;&gt; not people. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit behind them &gt;&gt; pushing them, &gt;&gt; causing them to get so angry. What would cause &gt;&gt; Cain to get so upset with his brother &gt;&gt; that he desired to kill him? &gt;&gt; Now we're seeing this. It's happening today. The flashing red lights are here. &gt;&gt; It's there. And you know, so uh if in the mid50s, &gt;&gt; brother Brennham is having death threats because of the gospel he preached. &gt;&gt; Because he's just bringing us back to the word. He's saying now these other religions, I'm not here against the people. It's a system. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit that's pushing them. Because a religious system is what killed 68 million martyrs &gt;&gt; during the dark ages. &gt;&gt; And he said, "There'll come a time where they'll kill you in the name of the Lord, thinking they're doing God a service." &gt;&gt; Amen. So they silenced his voice, but they can't silence what he was standing for &gt;&gt; because it was true. And brother Brennham said, "You can silence my voice." But he said, "That message will never be stopped." He said, "It will continue on." &gt;&gt; He said, "The voice will continue." Why? Because the same voice &gt;&gt; that's been down through the ages &gt;&gt; as it was in the days of the Apostle Paul. And through all of the ages, there were people that received the word of God for their hour. &gt;&gt; And their voices, their lives join the voices of the millions that went before them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I today, I want to say, let my voice &gt;&gt; Amen. Let my life be a witness &gt;&gt; of what God has done &gt;&gt; in this generation sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Horrific &gt;&gt; thing. And I pray for the uh the Kirk family. &gt;&gt; The wife and the young children. They're, you know, uh just a horrible thing. It is, &gt;&gt; but it's a spirit &gt;&gt; and it's permeating throughout the world. The world right now &gt;&gt; and you have got to be aware and understand the spiritual warfare that we are in &gt;&gt; and here in the midst of Laosa. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. Let's sing that song you were singing. Amen. Amen. Uh honor and glory and power to him. Amen. [Music] Amen means so be it. &gt;&gt; Blessing and honor and glory and power. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessing and honor and glory and power. &gt;&gt; One more time. Echo. Lift your hand and sing a May our life and our voice say amen. Oh blessings and honor and glory and power. [Music] [Applause] blessing and honor and glory and power. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And your voice with their voice says, "Amen." That means so be it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we join our voices with the voices down through the ages, the voice of many waters. of peoples and nations and tongues that have joined your voice and the same voice that was down through the messengers and they received that message. They then became the voice of that messenger until the final voice to the final age would be the bride. She's the evidence of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even as Sister Perfect sang that song, &gt;&gt; we are the evidence. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of what the word said would happen in this hour. &gt;&gt; Father, we say so be it. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. May it be done according to us, according to thy word and promises. We thank you. We praise you, &gt;&gt; Father. Give us the courage, the strength to go forward, Lord. &gt;&gt; To be one of those. Let our voice be your voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let our lives be reflective of your word. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray you'll bless each and everyone that is here this morning. and we ask you to do it for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you musicians. God bless you each and everyone. Just Amen. Let's just remain standing. Amen. And I feel something on my heart this morning to continue on. And I I think we'll try to sum it up in this service here with uh being wholly sanctified unto God. This is part two. 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. Brother Sean and Sister Janet. I bless you. should have you come up here and hug your neck and welcome you back, but I'll do that after service. We're so glad we miss you guys. &gt;&gt; You may think that you're not missed when you're not here, &gt;&gt; but you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll never forget a little Navajo boy up on a reservation. He said, "My job was to watch over my father's sheep." And he said, "I had over 200 head of sheep." And he says, "I didn't count them." He said, "But when one was missing, I felt it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I felt it. &gt;&gt; I said, "You mean to tell me you you didn't count? You didn't, you know, one, two, three, four, five. Oh, there's one missing." He said, "No, I just" And he said, "You may think they all look alike, but to a shepherd, they're all different." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Some walk different. Some hang on the outside of the crowd. Some stay close to the shepherd. Others like to stray a little bit. &gt;&gt; They're all different. But he says, "When they were missing, I felt it." &gt;&gt; "When you're missing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I feel it." Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you. 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verses 18- 24. In everything give thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things. and hold fast that which is good. &gt;&gt; Abstain from all appearance of evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you holy. That means in every part, &gt;&gt; in every phase, in its entire May the God of peace sanctify you entirely. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews Hebrews chapter 4. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Hebrews 4 and verse 12. Now, I want you to notice what the Bible says concerning the word of God. &gt;&gt; And I I want to take you and put this into your remembrance that if God sends a word in this hour, it's the sword of the spirit. It was symbolized by sword coming into the prophet's hand and said this is the third pull &gt;&gt; and its effect is going to be dividing us under. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Catch this now. Only this word that is in the hand of the prophet though you see all manifestations you see all kinds of gifts. You see all kinds of healings and miracles and ministries and so on and so forth. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said you don't judge them you know uh by their works because many will do wonderful works in his name cast out devils in his name. do all this stuff and he will say unto some of them, depart from me, you workers of iniquity. That's knowing what's right to do, but they don't do it. &gt;&gt; So, he doesn't deny the works that they do. &gt;&gt; But he says, "Their hearts are far from me. In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of men." Now watch this word of God, this message of the hour divides us under &gt;&gt; even to the point where that one minister, a prominent Pentecostal minister brought his wife up to be introduced to brother Brennham and he said she is a real saint. And when she was brought up there before brother Brennham, now I want you to understand he wasn't just looking at the outside, but he had a gift of discernment. How many know that? &gt;&gt; He had a gift of discernment. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And what he did is he he saw that it was a religious facade. the outward. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Many honorth me with their lips." &gt;&gt; But their hearts be far from me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he saw this and now he's dividing us under. He said, "You may have it on your body and on your spirit, but your soul &gt;&gt; because the control room would manifest the word of God in your life." &gt;&gt; He said, "You say you have the Holy Ghost?" He said, "How can you have the Holy Ghost and go contrary to he that is the author of the word?" &gt;&gt; He said, "It can't be." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said it might be a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; You say I might have shook, jumped, shouted, prophesied, preached. I might have cast out. He said that don't matter. &gt;&gt; He said, "What I want to see is a manifestation of the word in your life." &gt;&gt; And thank God that we have had a message that's come to help us to discern and to divide us under. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, watch this. Hebrews 4 and12. &gt;&gt; For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, &gt;&gt; piercing even to the dividing aunder of soul and spirit, showing you can it divides us under. You can have the Holy Spirit on your spirit. activate the gifts of the spirit, prophesy, speak in tongues, dance in the spirit, &gt;&gt; and do all of those things. And he says, "But it's not in your soul, &gt;&gt; I know that's hard to take for some, but this is your word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or his word. and of the joints and the mouth and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. May God add the blessing to the reading of his word this morning. You may be seated. Amen. All right. Um, I'm titling this being wholly sanctified unto God, part two. And I want to take a subject this morning that is affecting every one of you. I want to talk about mind battles. &gt;&gt; Mind battles. Every one of you are going to go through this. &gt;&gt; You're going to be tested and tried. Things are going to happen. Even brother Brennham was asked the question, how do I know when these thoughts that are coming to me and they bombber? How do I know if it's my thoughts or is it the devil putting the thoughts into your mind? Now understand brother Brent's doctrinal teaching. He said Satan cannot read your mind. &gt;&gt; He says he waits until you speak what's affecting you. Then he knows if you're receiving his transmission or not. Now he says, "You take the shield of faith whereby you quench the fiery darts which are evil thoughts &gt;&gt; whereby you quench the fiery darts that are coming toward you." &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham, are those my thoughts or are those the thoughts of the enemy? Because I don't know. And he says, well, take it back to the word. If whatsoever is pure, holy, virtuous, &gt;&gt; think on these things. But if it's not, it's just the devil. He said, you cannot stop a a a bird from flying over your head. &gt;&gt; Huh? The thoughts coming. He said, but you can stop it from making a nest. &gt;&gt; Some of you allow him to land and make a nest, and then you get all &gt;&gt; upset and wondered, "Are these my thoughts? Oh, I guess I'm not even a Christian. Who? Boohoo. And you cry and moan and this and that. And you're a lukewarm Christian. Am I? Am I? Am I not? Am I bride? Am I not? The Bible says, "Make your calling and your election sure." &gt;&gt; Many are called, but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; So, we have come here to make ourselves certain of what we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe that God is calling all of us to a higher calling &gt;&gt; to a greater sanctification &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; And remember now that Brother Brennham teaches and if we could, we got a new graph that was sent that's a little bit more legible than my poor I listen I'm not one of these guys that knows how to put all this stuff. So, I have to I have to take a photo, take the photo, print it out, then I have to write on it. Then I have to take a photo of my writing. And that's how I do it. But some people are good enough. They they can go ahead and do they know how to make circles and all of that. I don't. So, Brother Brennham says, notice that the three-fold nature of man, he talks about the body and the spirit and the soul. And he says, "Now to even better understand how that you are a tabernacle of God, you have to look at the tabernacle in heaven &gt;&gt; and the tabernacle in the wilderness &gt;&gt; because the outer court, inner court, holy of holies, he said that's a type of you." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You understand? Now, we're not going to go into that depth of teaching on that, but understand there's many people that come to the outer court, and that's as far as they go. &gt;&gt; And then there are others that come into the holy place, but there's very few that come into the holy of holies. &gt;&gt; Now, that's where we want to go. And you've got to be anointed. &gt;&gt; You've got to be walking right, talking right. Huh? &gt;&gt; The high priest. Huh? And we have a high priest that has gone before us. And because of his blood on us, we can enter in beyond the veil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have a right. Why? Because he made a way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, we got to be walking, talking, anointed. Huh? Not just with a a a little sprinkling, &gt;&gt; but they poured the oil upon Aaron's head and it dripped down from his head. his hair on through his beard onto his clothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, don't just give me a little sprinkling. Give me a full baptism. &gt;&gt; I don't want just a portion. God, &gt;&gt; saturate me. &gt;&gt; So, go ahead and keep that graph up for just a second. Let me just very quickly go over a couple simple things. &gt;&gt; I've got this. Okay. So, we see that Hebrews 4:12, the word of God is sharp as a two-edged sword. And we see justification is just the outer court. Brother Brandham also calls it the living room. He calls it the carnal man, the natural man. &gt;&gt; And understand that the first doctrine of Jesus Christ was you must be born again. Because all of you now we understand this that we came into this world without our theophony. &gt;&gt; We bypassed it. &gt;&gt; So you come here with a carnal body and you came into the world speaking lies. Nobody taught you how to be worldly. Why? You were born with a worldly nature. &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell children how to lie or teach them. They know how to lie. &gt;&gt; And it's so funny. They can lie to your face and they can have evidence all over them and they will try to get you to believe them. &gt;&gt; Have any of you had your children to lie? &gt;&gt; Oh, mommy, I never did that. I I wouldn't do that. My son Aus reached out, grabbed a cake, took the frosting. He ate it up. It was all over his mouth, his fingers. And Sandy came in and said, "Amos, did you get into that cake?" "No, I promise you, Mommy, I didn't do it." [Music] And and they'll look straight in your face and lie to you. Why? It was a nature. Brother Brennham said, "Satan is your nearer kinsman." &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's why you've got to be born again." And Nicodemus tried to understand, "What do you mean born again? Do I enter back into my mother's womb?" He said, "No, for that which is born of the flesh is flesh." &gt;&gt; So to be carnally minded is emnity with God. Neither can it understand the things of God. That's why this carnal man out here, the flesh man, he doesn't understand the things of God. And he's got five gates here, uh, see, smell, uh, hear, and taste, and touch. And everything that he surrounds himself in this world to be able to understand this realm that he's in, he uses one or all five of those gates. So, but God doesn't use any of those. &gt;&gt; We walk by faith and not by &gt;&gt; sight. &gt;&gt; We have something far greater. Stop here for a moment. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam said, "When God opens your eyes of the spirit, it's a far greater eyesight than physical." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "When God allows you to hear what the spirit is saying, you've got a far greater ear than the physical." Because, well, did Isaiah prophesy, "They have ears to hear, but they hear not. They have eyes to see, &gt;&gt; but they see not." &gt;&gt; But blessed are you. Let me tell you, my brother, my sister, I will declare unto you, you are of all people on this earth most blessed. If God has opened your eyes, &gt;&gt; it wasn't William Brandham. &gt;&gt; It wasn't teachers. &gt;&gt; It wasn't ministry. &gt;&gt; It was him. &gt;&gt; Just like he did on the road to Emmas. He broke the bread. What was the bread he broke? &gt;&gt; It's not physical bread. I am the bread which came down from heaven. Your fathers ate that bread and every one of them are dead. Right. &gt;&gt; He says, "Eat. This is my body. &gt;&gt; I am the bread which came down from heaven." &gt;&gt; And when he that day took their bread and he break it, their eyes came open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then they saw him. &gt;&gt; Now there are times when God breaks the bread of life to you, which is the word, &gt;&gt; and your eyes come open to it and you see him. You see him manifesting himself through scriptures and it it illuminates your understanding and you have one of those aha moments &gt;&gt; and you go, "Wow, &gt;&gt; that is so good." But what God does &gt;&gt; just like he did on the road to Emmas, he did not stay there and elaborate. &gt;&gt; What did he do? &gt;&gt; He moves back into that invisible realm. Understand that God comes down and illuminates you periodically. &gt;&gt; You're going through something. &gt;&gt; You're going through a trial something &gt;&gt; and you're wondering why why am I why is this happening? Thinking not strange &gt;&gt; as though these trials are coming against you that God maybe doesn't love you or or why me? &gt;&gt; He's doing it to watch your reaction. So now I want to not take a lot of time and expound here on the body man, the carnal man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, we know that the rain falls on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham had this come to him after he'd gone to the first Pentecostal meeting in Mishawaka. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he and you all know the moving of the spirit and people one stand up and prophesy another interpret it. Right? Which is prophecy. Tongues interpretation is prophecy. And he said, "Oh my, it must be among angels." They ask him, "Do you have the Holy Spirit? I ain't got what you got." Okay. Now, so he he says, "Oh, I just couldn't wait to shake their hands." Now, you all know he had a gift in his hand. And as he shook one hand just as true blue why he was just a real solid Christian. He said and I shook the other man's hand. He said boy if I ever met a hypocrite he was one. &gt;&gt; And you all know. So now he himself a prophet of God is questioning am I among angels or devils. &gt;&gt; How do I discern? &gt;&gt; Because I remember the first time I ever listened to the anointed ones at the end time. And brother Bram talks about the false anointed ones. And I always in my immature thinking was that the anointing on false seed was a false anointing. Brother Brennham said, "Oh no, &gt;&gt; the same rain, the same Holy Spirit that reigns on the just reigns on the unjust is not the cockab. It wasn't wheat." &gt;&gt; Because you don't change the seed that's inside you. &gt;&gt; The new birth does not change you from cocker to wheat. You always were weak. &gt;&gt; And because you are of seed, you have the ability to be reborn. Because in non seed, there's nothing to quicken. &gt;&gt; Same word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same anointing. And they feel it and they jump and they shout. &gt;&gt; He said, "But it's the rain on the just and the unjust." &gt;&gt; We're seeing, "Will I not pour out of my spirit upon all flesh?" Somebody say, "All flesh." &gt;&gt; All, &gt;&gt; good or bad. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what they believe and whether they're justified, sanctified, they feel his presence. And I'm not saying that that's not God's presence. &gt;&gt; So, let me get back to my notes here. The reason that we are having the problem among youth, youth, &gt;&gt; yes, all of us have problems, but we're talking about right now. Your children are at risk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the young people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Most of you older ones, huh? You're old enough. You've been there. &gt;&gt; You're experienced enough. But your kids, &gt;&gt; oh God, help us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. to have our children have an understanding of the spiritual warfare they're in. &gt;&gt; And the reason we are having the violent behavior &gt;&gt; among young children is brother Brennham said they have meggaosed &gt;&gt; upon violence in movies. &gt;&gt; The reason they have premarital sex, he said they see it on television and movies, on billboards. And he says, "What's happening is you're putting thoughts into their mind." Thoughts see, &gt;&gt; you're putting thoughts into their mind. And so now, unless they understand spiritual warfare, &gt;&gt; they don't fight against it. Well, &gt;&gt; I guess it's normal. Everybody's doing it. &gt;&gt; Might as well. Okay. What we need is the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here among us &gt;&gt; and teach it to your children. You must be born again and go on unto the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost baptism is a process. &gt;&gt; Doesn't come immediately. &gt;&gt; Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe? &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll go into that. I want to ask you who rates the movies and how do they rate them? Are they Holy Ghost filled Christians? It's &gt;&gt; ah they're worldly. So how do they rate it? Sex, violence. &gt;&gt; Huh? Profanity. And so you'll never have an Academy Award or a film to become popular unless it's filled with several of those things. &gt;&gt; Okay? And so now the devil is using this to permeate the minds of the youth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand that we fight not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers. &gt;&gt; Satan is an almighty power. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. He's a mighty power. &gt;&gt; But God's almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And some of you may think that you just have to say boo to the devil and he'll &gt;&gt; he'll go away from you. &gt;&gt; You can scream and holler all you want, but if you're not behind the fortitude of the word of God, &gt;&gt; Satan can come at you. Brother Brennham said, "You go out here and you do wrong and you do something wrong unless it and and you never confess the sin. It stays there. It becomes a stronghold. And then you wonder why you can't overcome the things you're over trying to overcome. Why they're overcoming you, why you're losing the battle. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you just come up here. We'll lay hands on you. I have a right. I command you, Satan, to come out of them." Brother Bram said, "They come up here and want me to pray for them." And he said, "If they have got unconfessed sin, that devil has a right to stay right there. &gt;&gt; I can pray for two, three days anointed with oil and that thing, that demon will laugh to your face." &gt;&gt; Now understand strongholds and every one of you. I have never met a demon-possessed person. Not obsessed but possessed. &gt;&gt; When a demon takes possession of a physical body. I have never met a demon-possessed person and counseledled with them. But what they knew immediately when they took the spirit, &gt;&gt; you can ask them in the name of Jesus Christ, I ask you, do you know when you opened the door? Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; And it came in &gt;&gt; and I did this. And unless you because the Bible says that that our word of God is not carnal &gt;&gt; but is mighty and powerful to the pulling down of strongholds. &gt;&gt; Now some spirits do not come out except by prayer and &gt;&gt; it's not the minister to pray and fast. &gt;&gt; It's the person you're having a problem. Get on your knees. &gt;&gt; Fast. Ask God why am I going through this? Why is this such a problem for me? Why can't I overcome? Get on your knees, fast, and pray. God will show you if you're honest. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said, "In the voice of God, in these last days, Moses heard the voice of God. He was full of theology. He knowed all the ins and outs, but it failed. He heard the voice of God. Moses was never the same &gt;&gt; and no man is ever the same. So now he goes from Moses to no man. &gt;&gt; You might hear in your ears the voice speaking, but when you hear in your heart the voice speaking. See, then you're hearing. &gt;&gt; You do not see with your eye. You look with your eyes, but you see with your heart. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see something, say, "I don't see it." You mean, "I don't understand it." &gt;&gt; You don't hear with your ears, you hear with your heart. Many times your ears hear the true voice of God. And it falls off you like water off a duck's back. But when you really hear, you hear with your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God, don't let our people &gt;&gt; just hear &gt;&gt; and it has no effect. &gt;&gt; But God, may you open the ears of our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want it to be lip service. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I don't want to spend much time on the body as I told you that the natural birth now consists of water, blood and spirit. But now let's take it just a little bit further for just a moment because you have to have conception. There is no birth without conception. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's pregnantation. Okay. Seed is germatized. &gt;&gt; Now, does every woman that becomes pregnant have a child? &gt;&gt; So now there's a process. We know biologically and according to medical science, there's three trimesters. But if something happens to that seed, it can be aborted. &gt;&gt; Amen. It can maybe go through nine months of growth and still come forth and have no life. &gt;&gt; There is a term for that and it's called stillborn. &gt;&gt; Horrible thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said the sweetest sound to any mother is directly after giving birth. is that the is the cry of their child. &gt;&gt; Now um so you have conception. She is germatized. She becomes pregnant. Her tastes change, things change. She used to like ice cream. Now she likes pickles. But there is something that can happen. Either you've hurt the fetus and it's called a miscarriage or it can go full term, she's carried at nine months actually come up to the point of having birth pains and there are some within our congregation that this has happened to. And I humble myself. I am not I am saying it's one of probably the most painful thing, hurtful things to a woman &gt;&gt; because she comes after having given birth, she comes back to church and she has no baby in her arms. &gt;&gt; So then after delivery there must be the breath of life. You understand that &gt;&gt; conception period of trimesters and then if everything goes well you can give birth go through the labor pains but praise God there must be the breath of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Brennham says in the basis of fellowship, follow along. Now, &gt;&gt; the basis of fellowship, when a baby's born, there's three elements. It comes from for the baby's life. What's the first thing? Excuse me, sisters. What's the first thing? Come water. If it isn't, it's a dry birth. The baby's in uh not normal. Second thing, blood. Okay, come on. Follow along with me, brethren. So, you got to stay right on top of this with me because I got I got a lot of going to get through. What's the next thing? Life. What come from Jesus? Water, blood, and life. Do you know what happened at Calvary? Brother Rem said he birthed the whole New Testament church. &gt;&gt; That seed gene of God there gave up his life. And when he did, now the life, excuse me, the seed except it die abides alone. &gt;&gt; And here the firstborn, the only begotten son of God. &gt;&gt; And he, brother Abraham said, everything, every seed gene of God was in him. &gt;&gt; And there he gave up the ghost. He died. Now Satan thought, I got him. It's done. It's over. This heretic, this man, I I I've killed him. What he did, he just birthed him in a whole another way. &gt;&gt; Water, blood, spirit. &gt;&gt; What came forth? The whole New Testament church &gt;&gt; poured out his blood upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And there, brother Ram said, he spilled out his seed upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see? He was birthing the church. Now, Brother Bram said, "If a baby's born and he's still born, he doesn't cry. There's no emotion to him. What's the matter with him? He's a deadorn baby." All right, if you guys stay with me now, &gt;&gt; that's what's the matter with the churches today. What's wrong with our Pentecostals? &gt;&gt; We're bringing forth too many deadborn babies. Exactly right. Exactly right. What do you do with a baby if he's still born like that? You just take him by the heels, raise him up, give him a good little posterior protoplasm stimulation &gt;&gt; and just as hard as you can and that fixes him up. And if anything the church needs tonight, it's a good old-fashioned gospel spanking with the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to see you come to church and you are without emotion. &gt;&gt; Is he done yet? Some of you have a resurrection factor when I say I'm closing. Get your purse. Get your kids. You're already You're already thinking where you're going. &gt;&gt; You come alive after I say in closing. &gt;&gt; I don't want Now here I am saying with all of you. I'm not here to try to get you emotionally worked up. No. &gt;&gt; But I want to see you have some life when the word of God goes forth &gt;&gt; to it stimulate you enough. Brother Ron, you you said something the other day that almost almost got me to say amen. &gt;&gt; Well, why don't you let go and let God &gt;&gt; say &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother. &gt;&gt; It's like a birth. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; It hurts and it feel a whole lot better, man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to let it out. Sometimes you got to break the sound barrier because when you break the sound barrier, it's unlimited. &gt;&gt; You think you want more power of God, open your mouth and begin to praise God for what you got. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of you I have yet to see get beside yourself. I wonder &gt;&gt; and then I I'm thinking some of you got complexes. You're so unique and you're afraid or maybe you got a complex maybe people will think I'm I'm odd &gt;&gt; or I'm weird. &gt;&gt; Who cares? &gt;&gt; You are weird. &gt;&gt; You are unique. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible calls you a peculiar people. &gt;&gt; Wow. Brother Ron the other day. Oh, it was so good. I almost &gt;&gt; Well, quit saying almost. &gt;&gt; Yes, sister. You can say amen. Yes, brother. If you're a young man, yes, you can. You can't stand up and say praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you sit there in church with no emotions, no nothing. Year by year, everything I'm thinking, my what in the world is going to get you to get stirred up &gt;&gt; fire. Don't yell fire in a crowded. I was the shop assistant in beginning electronics. And so I was allowed into the back room where I had all of the electrical stuff and shocking stuff. And we had an ionizer. It's it's a looked like a big pencil with a end on it. And so you could take it's a long deal like this. And you you plugged it in And when you got close to something that was metal, there'd be an electrical charge that you'd see this current go kind of like these science Frankenstein. It's alive and so like this. So I thought, man, this is this is so good. There there there was one girl in class and she was just the studious type and she she just stood there with her or sat there all the time with her little smirk and never you know there was nothing come out of her but she was just a a real now nothing wrong with studious kids but anyway I I had a couple other guys I said okay see this electric electrical wire take it and hook it to her chair and it had a wooden seat with metal grommets that held the talk. And I said, "Watch as a teacher." And I went into the back room. Nobody could see me. And so the teacher is teaching and all of a sudden I turn it on and the end of the wire when I got close enough and I hear I get sent to the office. But sometimes I'm wondering, "Oh God, what is it going to take to get you once in a while, I'm not talking about all the time, and I'm not talking about you getting up and acting crazy, but I will say this. When the Holy Spirit really comes upon you, it'll, Brother Brent says, cause you to act unsemly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Yeah. You might get out of character a little bit. Now, Brother Bram said, "Then uh spoken word is the original seed." Are we together, brother? Okay, there we go. Good. Let's follow along. Now, she left Jesus, the word, the word, and married another man called the Pope with dogma. &gt;&gt; And she hasn't got Jesus, she's got a pope. Right. &gt;&gt; See, the Protestant hasn't got Jetus Jesus. It's got a denomination. Same thing. &gt;&gt; An image unto the beast. So, she can't give a word birth. Now, here's the prophet bringing a terminology that we've never heard up until now. &gt;&gt; A word birth. Oh, they've had a birth, all right, but it wasn't a birth of the word. It was a birth of denomination. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because everything will bring forth of its own kind, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So he says she can't give a word birth to her children, none of them. She is a harlot herself. The Bible said she had a cup in her hand. She was given out her doctrine to the people which was an abomination, the filthiness of her fornication. What is fornication? It's living unclean. and for her doctrine she's giving to the people is the filthiness of her fornications made drunk with the wine of her fornication. Now follow along. He takes this same thought and elaborates on this in the sermon birth pains. Now he says notice quickly now she in that stage beyond a shadow of doubt we're in the Ladyan church age. Now her messenger has promised in Malachi the 4th chapter he's promised to do it. The message is to bring back the word bring the people back to a word birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to be she is to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Now he said there are two systems working in the church world today &gt;&gt; in the church. Two two spirits. &gt;&gt; Two systems. &gt;&gt; Yeah. both religious. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm going to get this off my shoulder. Then I have it over with. &gt;&gt; We all know that the word that's the word of God and the denominational system. Two different. There's the true system at work just as they was Jacob and Esau. One after the spirit, the one and another one after the flesh. What is it? Esau and Jacob was fighting in the wombs of the mother even to the time they were born. And so is the denominationals and the word fighting one against the other. See now this end time message I want you to understand is a word given to the church &gt;&gt; to bring forth a word birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "You preach Pentecostal doctrine, you bring forth Pentecostal children. You preach Lutheran doctrine, you bring Lutheran children." &gt;&gt; You understand? If you teach them how to be religious, our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, they say prayers and don't pray. &gt;&gt; They have a religious &gt;&gt; way about them. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Outwardly they have a religious facade. &gt;&gt; Hail Mary, mother of God. &gt;&gt; They have a religion. &gt;&gt; And according to their taste, they will find a church that will satisfy their worldly taste. True. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you choose a church, choose one that's &gt;&gt; wordbased. &gt;&gt; Not just a feel-good church. Not there just well, it was so good and our singing and our worship and everything, but what about the lives of the people? &gt;&gt; Okay. So the end time message then is the word of God as a sharp two-edged sword. Now the reason that in the 50s they wanted to shoot brother Brennham out of the pulpit was because he's exposing blasphemous names. &gt;&gt; Jezebel religion. &gt;&gt; He's exposing church entity. They hated him for &gt;&gt; and the only reason that so much of the time they couldn't get to him is because he had an angel stand between &gt;&gt; you come on up here. You want to prove me wrong? &gt;&gt; Come on up here. Bring your Bible. Stand here right next to me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I'm wrong, may God strike me dead right here in the in this pulpit. You that you you talk about a prove me wrong &gt;&gt; statement. &gt;&gt; He said, "May God strike me dead if I'm wrong." &gt;&gt; Now, you bring your Bible up here because you that been on my back all this about water baptism, baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he goes on and on. He said, "Come up here and stand." He said, "Not one of them moved." He said, 'You're smarter than I thought. &gt;&gt; He said, 'You know, the angel of the Lord is standing directly to my right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't get to him. &gt;&gt; Even when that maniac, &gt;&gt; I'm going to break every bone in your body. And he said, mine, that guy's a big old guy. He could have done it. Brother Rem said, "I just stood there. I let him come. I'm gonna" and he's screaming and yelling. He's foaming at the man. This guy is upset. I'm going to break every bone in your body. He's got a devil. &gt;&gt; He let him come. Come right there. He said, "I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; He said, "You'll gravel at my feet. The man fell at his feet. &gt;&gt; You don't mess with God. &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid to stand there. Okay. He said one day, mark it down. He said, "I believe they'll shoot me." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? This is 1950s. 50s. This is not 2025. This is in the 50s. He hasn't even come to the full manifestation of the third pole in his own ministry. He's just out there performing a sign talking about Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new. So, let's go. So now if you have uh this the this one here remember the gifts in the body. Do you do you have that? Can you show me that? So we'll take a moment here for just a second because we want to look at the gifts in the body. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now remember the body. Now understand this. Gifts and callings are what? If you got a gift of speaking in tongues, you had it before you got converted. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Prophecy, &gt;&gt; healing, knowledge, those things. What is it? Gifts and callings are without repentance. You had it there. The only thing is once you got born again and you come into the knowledge of gifts and the Holy Spirit anoints it, it activates that gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you have here according to Romans 12 4-9 you see the gift of exhorting or the gift of teaching the gift of prophecy the gift of ministry the gift of ruling the gift of giving the gift of mercy the gift of governments and the gift of helps those are gifts within the body &gt;&gt; that is in I want to say the spirit realm &gt;&gt; spirit realm So according to 1 Corinthians 12 8-10, you have discerning of spirits, you have interpretation of tongues, you have knowledge, you have prophecy, you have wisdom, you have faith, you have healing, you have miracles, and you have tongues. And brother Brandham said, I have seen them all being operated. They are gifts of the spirit and the holy spirit operating in that gift and they can and will prophesy and will be correct. &gt;&gt; And he said yet their soul is not anointed and had the Holy Spirit come and sit on the throne room. That's why their lives do not match the the pattern of the word. &gt;&gt; Okay? It doesn't. You can't say you are Holy Ghost filled and he sits on your throne room and you live any kind of life you want to. &gt;&gt; It doesn't compute. &gt;&gt; It's not there. Now they hated him for it. &gt;&gt; Why? He's saying it's the Holy Spirit. All right. And he says, "You say you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the sermon, the rapture." I gave you the quote there. I said that don't mean nothing. Because you know why? Because they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost on their body. &gt;&gt; They jumped sh they had it on their spirit activating the gifts of the spirit. &gt;&gt; But the throne room Christ wasn't sitting there. &gt;&gt; Their self-will said, "I can do whatever I want. &gt;&gt; I can live any kind of life." Why? Look, God operates my gift. &gt;&gt; Speak in tongues. Watch. I have faith to move mountains. And you can have all of these things. I have can have the gifts. I can have faith that I might move mountains. I might give my body to be burned. And he says, "And if you have not love because God &gt;&gt; is love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You are sounding brass &gt;&gt; and tinkling symbols." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. So now remember, I take you Bible examples. I'm not going to flood you with all of those examples, but Caiaphas, who was the high priest who helped have Jesus crucified, prophesied. &gt;&gt; Sa uh Balum prophesied. &gt;&gt; Judas preached the gospel, laid hands on the sick, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Had all kinds of signs and wonders. And yet, when it come to the Holy Ghost, baptism showed his colors. Yep. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without repentance. Now, here's where the word of God becomes a sharp two-edged sword. It begins now to divide us under between the spirit and the soul. Theology won't teach you that. Seminary won't teach you that. And man's teaching will not do that. It must be a revelation of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; or you fail to catch it. Does not the Bible say try the spirits to see whether they be of God? &gt;&gt; Try the spirits. &gt;&gt; Brother Rem says, "How do I try the spirits?" He said, "It's not you trying them. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God that tries the spirits." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the brothers that brought me the message, he thought trying of the spirit was to actually kick somebody in the shin and watch your reaction. Come here, Bo. Let me try your spirit. That ain't trying of spirits. Kick you in the shin. Chances are you're going to get But what? But yeah, you see, saints of God, there was too much false teaching &gt;&gt; and things that were told on how do I try the spirits? No. Give it the word test. &gt;&gt; It's not you testing it. It's the word. That's not what the word says. That's not the way the word will be. &gt;&gt; And so now the pattern of the word and you say therefore you're false. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; brother Brennham there in that meeting. I think it's in the sermon the name of Jesus. And he said there come tongues and interpretation. There's one among us that doesn't believe all this stuff. remember shaving a haircut, six bits, and and a pencil coming up and a tune going on and a and a table floating. You all remember that? A table floating in the air. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there's somebody here that doesn't believe that this is the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yeah, that's right." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm him in the name of the Roman Catholic Church. Tell me, is this the truth? table kept floating. &gt;&gt; He said, "Tell me in the name of father, son, holy ghost." And how many of you know the devil travels in the name father, son, and holy ghost? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "In the name of father, son, holy ghost, tell me, are you saying the truth?" Stayed right there. And he said, "Now, in the name of Jesus Christ, tell me." He said, "That table hit the ground. The legs got knocked off it. I'm a false spirit &gt;&gt; trying to deceive. &gt;&gt; What is it? All kinds of &gt;&gt; supernatural floating lights and &gt;&gt; all kinds of stuff. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants some kind of vindication. &gt;&gt; You ever had a picture taken of yourself and something weird about it? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I had one person. I'm sitting in my my lazy boy chair and somebody took a picture and I I'm just sitting there just like this. Got my feet up and there's an aura of light all around it. Of course, I sent it around the world to everybody I knew. This is the vindication. Oh, stop. all this kind of stuff or some kind of light or strange thing come up and everything. See, that was God. No, sometimes sometimes I'm a photographer and I question a lot of these pictures that quote are supernatural lights. What it is? You have a lens, huh, &gt;&gt; Amber? you know, you take photos and if there's a light over here and you got a star filter on your lens and all of a sudden little baby man, he's got he's got rays of light. This is a proper child. I've never seen this. It's a star filter. Or it used to be I used to uh develop film. You had the dark room. You go in there, you take a a negative, you take put it down and and and and you burn the picture for so long, then you put it in any in a liquid and you this and you put it into another one and pretty soon the picture appears. Well, there's times when if you don't mix your chemicals properly, because there used to be some crystals that we put in there and you had to mix them properly and if you didn't, some of the crystals slid up on top of the paper and you got a little star or some kind of thing and Oh, see that's a vindication. No, that's a crystal. So much of the time people are looking for some kind of &gt;&gt; vindication. &gt;&gt; I'm not here, you know. Hey, hey, listen. The vindication is is my life matching what the word of God says. If so, that's the vindication. &gt;&gt; Such a perfect What a perfect song. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the word being made manifest. So, let's go back to this one. Yeah, the nice new one here that somebody made for me. I won't tell you who it was, but she Yeah, it's perfect. She told me, "Don't tell anybody." I didn't. All right. Now, uh, I want you to understand that there are five gates to your spirit realm. Because now right here this is drawn as a womb. And brother Brennham said the womb to your spirit is your mind. &gt;&gt; And understand that everything you go through is going to come through the concept of what you receive into your mind. And if you sit there and you allow those seeds, whether they're good or bad, it will reproduce itself. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's a womb. Right? &gt;&gt; A woman, if she receives a bad man's seed, she's going to bring forth that bad man's seed. She's going to reproduce what was &gt;&gt; placed in her. &gt;&gt; She's an incubator of the word. &gt;&gt; You follow me? &gt;&gt; So now we have here the womb of the spirit, which is the mind. That's why everything you go through is a mind battle. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yep. &gt;&gt; Okay. And so you have here you have uh imaginations, conscience, memory, reason, and affections. And the devil will use those and so will God. &gt;&gt; Okay? But you can be fooled by certain things. Now, I'm just going to go through some things here and I'll show you. Brother Bren says in one of the most illuminating sermons, the greatest battle ever fought. &gt;&gt; He said it started in heaven, was cast down the earth, and it became human battles. He said God chose the heart, but Satan chose the mind. So now watch this. The battle raged when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the flu that had it come in. That's the channel it run down. Her reasoning. See, in her soul, she reasoned. Her eyes was sight. She saw the serpent. He was beautiful, handsome, far better than her own husband. He was most subtle of all the beasts of the field. He's probably a fairer man than her husband. He looked like a great masculine beast standing there. how great he was. He is trying to tell her what a great thing it was. And the first thing she did, she opened her mind. And when she did, human reasoning caught it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brim said it took him years of talking and meeting with her alone and sewing seed. &gt;&gt; Oh, Eve, you look so beautiful. I'm I you know, hey, come just sit down. Let me chat with you. I know. Don't get Adam. Don't bring Adam here. No, no, no, no. Even though Jesus said, "Go get your husband and bring him here &gt;&gt; because there is a See, &gt;&gt; he could have never got to her &gt;&gt; had Adam been standing here." &gt;&gt; So, he caught her at a time when she was alone. &gt;&gt; And then he used the channel of reasoning. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be like God? Huh? Don't you want the no good from evil? Yeah. Yeah. and already deceiving her by saying, "Uh, you'll not die." Because she quoted the word, "But of every tree of the field, of everything." Huh, James, you did a great job. Of one thing, don't eat &gt;&gt; just one thing. Everything else you can eat. &gt;&gt; Everything. Avocado, citrus, pomegranate, anything. Eat it. &gt;&gt; But one, &gt;&gt; but why? Because the day you eat thereof &gt;&gt; is the day you die. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? Just one thing. &gt;&gt; So she opened human reasoning. Where was their greatest battle fought? &gt;&gt; In her mind, &gt;&gt; where's the greatest battle that we fight? &gt;&gt; Now understand that when Jesus spoke to the Pharisees, he's discerning their thoughts. In Matthew 2:es 6-9, and there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, why does this man thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only? And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they reasoned them within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your heart? Whether it is easier to say to the sick of the Pauly, "Thy sins be forgiven thee." Or to say, "Arise and take up thy bed and walk." Which is easier. Your sins are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rather than say, "Take up your bed and walk." So they are all of they're they're upset with him. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand that many people will appeal to your channel of reasoning. The prophet said this, but it never happened. The prophet said this, where was it fulfilled? Now understand, God is his own interpreter, and he brings the word to pass as he chooses. &gt;&gt; And you can miss it. You can miss it as far as east from west of not seeing it. Why? Because of preconceived uh &gt;&gt; terminology. Well, I'll tell you what. I think there's going to be a tent. Oh, yeah. Brother Rem said it was a vision. He said it looked like a cathedral. Why don't we call it cathedral vision? Well, he said a tent. He said, you know, according to the vision, it looked like a tent. That's why people say, well, he's got to come back. He's got to have a return ministry. got to have a tent. And when he does, he's going to preach us from illegitimate to legitimate and all of this stuff. And he's going to fly into Mosley's airplane. He's going to go to the White House, give him thus sayith the Lord. He's going to shoot to brown bear. On and on and on. Why? Because what it is when brother Brennan went off of the scene, there were things that people said his ministry is not finished. He he he didn't fulfill it. Well, he's got to come back. He even why the seventh seal hasn't even been revealed. He said, you know, we come right up to the seventh seal and it's a mystery. And yet, why do we have a book called the revelation of the &gt;&gt; six seals? &gt;&gt; Seven. What is the seven? He the seven seals of mystery. You know what he said? Revelations 10 1:7. Seventh seal. &gt;&gt; He said that's his coming. &gt;&gt; Shh. Don't tell nobody. Because if they don't get it, you can't teach it to them. &gt;&gt; But when God opens your eyes and you realize this whole message is about the coming of the Lord, it's getting a bride ready for his coming. And thank you, Lord. I'm a product of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; It's been open. The mysteryy's been revealed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is it? Who is it? It's Christ. He is those seals. &gt;&gt; He broke every one of them. &gt;&gt; But only to the elect. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; So false prophets even among this message &gt;&gt; have got to come and give carnal reasoning &gt;&gt; because it's a lack of understanding by revelation. So now they put their reasoning to it. &gt;&gt; God didn't ask you to reason it. &gt;&gt; He don't want your interpretation. Proverbs 3 and5, "Trust in the Lord with all thine high heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding." &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't have to figure it out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Say what he said. Say what the vision said. &gt;&gt; I don't care how God wants to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; He's the interpreter. &gt;&gt; He'll bring it to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Visions are not to be interpreted. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you are void of spiritual revelation, you will lean to your own carnal reasoning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you can't figure it out. Well, he said thus and thus'll happen. Didn't happen. I want to ask you, any of you see him take a baby shoe and try to lace it? That's part of the vision. &gt;&gt; Any of you see him? He said, "I'll meet you in there." Where? Did he go there? He was above. &gt;&gt; I'll meet you in there. He said, "There I was. I'm looking down. People coming in, right?" &gt;&gt; And he says, "But why? Why there? Why that little room? Is it not written in the scripture?" Always goes back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll meet you in there. I want to ask you, where was Elijah's prayer closet? &gt;&gt; Wilderness. &gt;&gt; Wilderness. &gt;&gt; He goes to a cave. &gt;&gt; He goes to the wilderness. He goes to the Sabino Canyon. Huh? Sunset Mountain. &gt;&gt; It shall be light about the evening time. The path to glory you shall surely find. What do you think this attraction was? What is this attraction in the Coronado Forest of Arizona? The people are coming from all over. Billy Silva goes over there and he takes people. Where are you, Billy? And you brought me a three cornered pyramid. You know how many people have gone over there? Hey, I tell you what, they're hard to find now. He said, "There he was there." And he said something said throw up a rock. Why? It takes a an action to create a reaction. &gt;&gt; He said something's going to happen, brethren. You better. &gt;&gt; You better get under shelter. &gt;&gt; Throws up a rock. Whirlwind. A blast shook it. He said, "Cut the tops of the mosquite trees off. blasted the side of the mountain. Rocks went scattering. Thus sayaith the Lord, judgment striking the west coast. Do you see? What is this attraction that happened in the Coronado Forest? &gt;&gt; What is it that's caused an attraction to you? Was it just the first pull, the healings? Was it the discernments? Oh, thou art a man come from God. No man could do these things except God be with him &gt;&gt; until he begins to reveal through the third pole. He said, "This is the vindication of your ministry." Wait a second. Wait a second. You mean the sword? And that event means a furtherance of his gospel. I thought it was the end. He thought it was the end. I'm not even coming home. &gt;&gt; He thought he's going to die. go back and listen to the tapes. &gt;&gt; If you were there in his family, you would have seen he's a nervous wreck. &gt;&gt; All shook up. Can't sleep. Can't eat. I'm not coming home. Billy, take care of the kids. You'll find my Bible up there somewhere. He said, "No man can live through a blast like that." &gt;&gt; So now he's up there thinking, "It's the end of his ministry." He's praying, "Oh God," he's on his knees, got his hands up. "Oh God, what does this vision mean? What does it mean?" He said something struck his hand. &gt;&gt; He said, "There wasn't nobody around." &gt;&gt; He said, "I had to pinch myself. Is this real?" And he said the handle of the sword fit my hand. &gt;&gt; He said it must be a king's sword. &gt;&gt; He said it's not a king. &gt;&gt; It's the king. &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; Now the word of God is placed in his hand in a third pole. The revealing of the word. &gt;&gt; The discerning of spirit. The dividing of sunder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see? Do you see what the word of God sharp two-edged sword to the dividing and sunder between spirit and soul. &gt;&gt; Man is always trying to figure things out. So now go back to that drawing of the the three circles there because I want to go over things. Okay. Now I've always told because brother Biscll did a relational association uh he took the first letter memory imagination conscience affection and reasoning my car everybody wants my car I'll never forget that so probably you will think okay memory so now uh you have here memory imaginations conscience affection and reason okay so now memory is Good. You have to have something in your memory for it to be brought back to your remembrance. That's why you come to church and sometimes it don't compute. That's okay. It's being logged because after my departing this will come to you. Uh why do you not understand these things? Why don't you understand? He said the day is coming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a timereleased revelation. It comes to you in season. &gt;&gt; That's why there were very few people that understood the prophet's ministry when he was here. &gt;&gt; Even brother Billy Paul said, "I did not know who daddy was, and I didn't see the scriptural reference of his gift until after he died." To me, he was daddy. &gt;&gt; He said, "I used him." Go up and go hunting. Go uh uh pig hunting. And guess what? stand on the edge. He he got into a place where he crawled down onto a ledge and there's about a four or five foot uh little ravine and it's 30 40 foot drop and no no dad. Dad, where are you? I'm over here. Billy, what's the matter? I want to jump, but I don't know. You have to have the say the Lord. I'm not going to jump. No, Billy. No, you don't. Go ahead. I'm telling you, you'll make it. No, Daddy. Tell me by vision. Okay, I see you make it. &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? Was too close. You were You were too close to the forest to see the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there were no evening light fellowships and end time message tabernacle. No, there was a few people catching. Wow, this is a great ministry. &gt;&gt; Okay, they saw man this was amazing. So they saw the ministry. So memory, it is a process of remembering something. Now I I I must admit that the older I get, the less of it I have. Anybody know what I'm talking about? My wife and I are talking to one another. Sandy. Sandy. She goes, "Yes, honey." And I go, "I just forgot. I'm I I'm I'm ready to tell her. It's there. It's on." Sandy, yes, honey. I forgot. Oh, you got to be kidding me. She did it to me the other day. I said, "Uh-huh. Uh-huh. See, see, you didn't you you." So, memory, it can be used good or bad. Okay. So, memory, the enemy can come and bring to your memory past failures and path past problems. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're going to have a hard time getting over it. And I remember, hey, man, don't you trust no preacher. Don't you trust nobody. Excuse me. Don't even let anybody become your friend &gt;&gt; because you were betrayed. You remember you want that to happen again? Go ahead. And he anoints your memory and say, "Okay, man. I'm going Hey, hey, I don't even know if I had to go to church. All those people and hey, &gt;&gt; you you remember." So, Satan will use &gt;&gt; memory against you if you're not careful. &gt;&gt; You know, girls are real good about memory on certain things. You know, they had a boyfriend, they had a certain song they play. That's a R song. So, you're dating a girl and you know, you got the old radio on this before my conversion. And a certain comes on and the girl goes, "Oh, Johnny." What? This ain't Johnny, it's Ronnie. You understand what I'm talking about? But she was thinking about her her memory. Okay. Hey, I'm the papa bear in this fairy tale. Okay. So, if you're not careful, sometimes the only way you get really anointed is stroll down memory lane. &gt;&gt; Oh, you remember when Do you remember the meetings and what it was like and the prophet came and oh it was so good and he came out? I tell you even the way he walked under the bulb but and it was he just rireed with humility as those were the good old days. And so sometimes the only time people get anointed is they walk down memory lane. &gt;&gt; Well Jesus Christ is the same. Not just yesterday. &gt;&gt; If you're not careful, you'll be one of the Beatles. &gt;&gt; Yesterday, all my troubles seem so far away. Now they've come here to stay. Oh, I believe. Oh, I don't believe in yesterday. I believe in today &gt;&gt; and I believe in forever &gt;&gt; because if you're not careful, the enemy will use memory against you. Okay? &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 15:es 1-2. Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also you received, and wherein you stand, by which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that when I preach this message, I'm putting you back in remembrance. of what he said. &gt;&gt; I don't have a message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm just a mail carrier. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you of what he said. That's why I give you quotes. &gt;&gt; I don't just come up here and paraphrase it and well, the prophet of God said and this and that and so next thing you know, I'm paraphrasing what he said. No, say what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So the seed of all your emotions and feelings and sensations are in your mind. The vast majority of your battles you will face in your Christian walk will have to do with what goes through the battle in your mind. &gt;&gt; Any of you ever have mind battles? &gt;&gt; Huh? Somebody say something to you or didn't say it the way you liked it or bypassed shaking your hand after church. She don't like me. I know she don't. She She didn't shake my hand. Walked right past me. I waved to them. They wouldn't didn't wave back. You ever had somebody wave to you and you you waved back and kind of find out they're waving to the person behind you? But your your imagination, huh? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You know, uh, they didn't shake my hand. So now your imagination, any of you have your imagination run wild? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Especially at night. &gt;&gt; Any of you ever get a sickness? It's much worse at night. I'm going to die. Sunrise, I feel a whole lot better. &gt;&gt; Why? Because &gt;&gt; we are not children of darkness, but of day. &gt;&gt; But your imagination, if you're if it goes unchecked, &gt;&gt; my wife bought one of those medical self-help books at Costco. If you have a cold, you turn back, it say, read page 76. Do you have a runny nose? Yes. Do you have a fever? If you do, go to page 92. I go to page 92 and check, check, check. Pretty soon, I got every symptom. It's horrible. My wife took it away from me. She says, "Honey, quit reading that. &gt;&gt; The Bible says by your stripes he is you are healed." No, no. It said right here. I got every one of those symptoms. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Brim said, "Yes, you may have the symptom, but if you believe the symptom rather than the word, you'll stay there on your cot and die. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord." &gt;&gt; I mean, we're all human. &gt;&gt; We all have battles of our mind. &gt;&gt; Have a lump on the back of your neck. Oh my. I I I was at Norway. This is funny. I was in Norway and and see this mole on my face. See it here? Well, I used to have another one. There was two of them. Okay. And so anyway, we're in Norway. I've got my kids and I've been preaching and everything. And all a sudden, man, the next morning the Wow, I get a Mount Vuvius thing on. It's red. It's sore. Oh, look at that mole, honey. And she went to Don't touch it. Don't. So, we didn't have no insurance or nothing. So, this sister Armstrong, uh, Sister Nita Armstrong, she took me to the doctor and, uh, you know, she said, "I'll pay for it." Okay. Okay. I go in there and the doctor said, "Uh, come here. Let me look at that." So, he's got one of these round things on his head where the light shines in. So, you know, there's a light coming down here like this. And he goes, "So, how long have you had this?" Well, a day or so. Does it hurt much? And he presses all it was a huge pimple and it squirted went all over his Sorry, doc. Do you know that demon left me? Do you know that I had that? That thing bothered me so bad. I thought I'm dying, man. This is cancerous. And look, it's got this big and it come off so quickly. And after that, I started laughing. I said, "Yeah, yeah, the dog is wiping his face." How much of the time, huh, do we allow things in our mind? Greatest battle ever fought. The Apostle Paul and James did an excellent job about this, but let me read the scripture. Oh, I'm I'm I'm overtime. &gt;&gt; That's all right. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Go on." &gt;&gt; Go on. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Romans 7. Romans 7. For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal and sold under sin. For that which I do I allow not. For what I would that I do not but what I hate. &gt;&gt; I do that that I do. &gt;&gt; Any of you been there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're talking my language here, buddy. &gt;&gt; Happened many times. That which I want to do, I don't do. &gt;&gt; That which I didn't do, that I do. &gt;&gt; Now, now watch him show this. Now then, it's no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. &gt;&gt; For I know that in me, and there here, I didn't put this quotation in here. I didn't put the parenthesy. That is in my flesh. Somebody say flesh. &gt;&gt; That in my flesh is no good thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. Give it to Holy Ghost. It's still no good thing. &gt;&gt; This flesh is going to bother you until we drop it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why your flesh is a byproduct of sin. &gt;&gt; Satan has an affinity to it. Puts thoughts into your mind. &gt;&gt; That's why you have such a mind battle. But in the moment, in a twinkling of an eye, we shall all be &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Changed. &gt;&gt; Immortality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? We're going to go from mortal to immortality. &gt;&gt; Thank God. from carnal to spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God will not allow anything sinful to come into his presence. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over there, that body that you will have will never have it'll never have an aching backraise, &gt;&gt; a bad knee, &gt;&gt; won't have false teeth. You won't wear glasses. &gt;&gt; There'll be no hospitals, no nurses. There'll be no ambulance. There'll no be no police. &gt;&gt; Wow. Think think of that community. &gt;&gt; Talk about something so wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's beyond my comprehension. &gt;&gt; But I do know this. The older I get, the more I want that &gt;&gt; I do. When's a young man? Hey, death was so far and forboating and but the older I get, I think that's not so bad. &gt;&gt; If this body be dissolved, I have another one waiting. &gt;&gt; So sometimes I'm saying not that I want to be unclothed, but I want to be clothed upon. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. Okay. Now verse 20. Now if I do that, I would not. It's no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. I find I find then a law. James, here's your sermon. I find a law. &gt;&gt; When I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man. Do you see the inward man? Not the outward man. That guy is a He's a hypocrite. He's a jokester. &gt;&gt; Huh? He's a Jacob &gt;&gt; before conversion. &gt;&gt; But after conversion, he becomes an Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. I delight in the law of God after the inward man. I see another law in my members, warning against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this dead? Any of you ever gotten mad at yourself? &gt;&gt; You'd um do you? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have. &gt;&gt; Why? If you had any brains, &gt;&gt; oh wretched &gt;&gt; man that I am, who &gt;&gt; shall deliver me from this body of death? Now watch what he says. I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh I serve the law of sin. &gt;&gt; It's there with me. &gt;&gt; Thank God in a moment and twinkling your eye, there's going to be a change. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must guard your mind so of what you allow to be put into it. &gt;&gt; If you sow fleshly things into your mind, you shall reap corruption. It's called the law of sowing and reaping. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. &gt;&gt; Put for you sow to the flesh, you shall of the flesh what? &gt;&gt; You're going to reap corruption. &gt;&gt; Why am I having all of these things? &gt;&gt; Huh? Why am I going through what I'm going through? I'm having such a hard time, Brother Ron. I don't even want to come to church anymore. I can't read my Bible. There's no anointing. Are you praying and reading? No. Yeah. Well, &gt;&gt; be not deceived. God's not mocked. &gt;&gt; So, you got to sew to the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sewing to the spirit is reading your Bible and praying every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because seven days without prayer makes one week. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We e a K. &gt;&gt; Do you know the more you pray, the more you want to pray? Do you know the less you pray, the less you want to pray? &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The mind is the womb of the spirit. Brother Brandham said in the spoken word is the original seed. He says the gateway to the soul. You remember now there is a woman of the physical. There's a woman of the spirit. Did you believe that there's a spiritual womb and a physical womb? And the mind is the womb to the spirit. So whatever you allow into your mind, if it's uncontrolled, if it's wrong seed, it will bring forth and conceive in your life. And a doubleminded man is what? &gt;&gt; Unstable. And &gt;&gt; all &gt;&gt; not just part. all. Should I go to church? I don't know. Should I have fellowship? I don't know. I'm unstable. Nothing like an unstable person. How would you like to be married to a wife and she gets up? I don't know if we should be married. Yeah, but I thought you said yes. Yeah, but you caught me at a wrong time, man. What? What? What kind of relationship would that be? I don't know. You talk to your husband, you say, "I don't know." &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be a horrible way to live? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; The Bible says you take it for better, for worse. And sometimes it's for worse. &gt;&gt; Honestly, &gt;&gt; that's why you better check out who you're thinking on marrying. You young people. Huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You dads, I hope you chase away that guy. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; if he's a shyer, you know, your daughter comes to you. Dad, what do you Don't you even think of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you should come to your pastor and pastor, you know, even daddy thinks the guy No. What? You want me to be an old maid the rest of my life? Everybody else is married by their 16. Oh, stop. I would rather I would rather you stay unmarried. The pro Hey, listen. The Apostle Paul said, "Listen, &gt;&gt; it's better for you to marry than to burn." &gt;&gt; So, if you're burning, you better get married. Okay? But the Apostle Paul said, "Now, I would rather that you remain as I &gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Unmarried, single. &gt;&gt; Because a single person thinks on the things of the Lord, how that they might serve God, but a married person thinks on how they might serve their husband or whatever. Huh? &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you what, you take a spiritual nose dive right after you get married. &gt;&gt; Right? Because when you were single guy, hey, you don't have to, you know, think about anything. You just do what you want. You can have a Bible study. You can do you can pray and read and everything. But now you get married, you think on how it might please your husband. But the Apostle Paul said, if you get married, he said, I will tell you, you're going to have trouble in the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. Because she don't think like you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She comes from a different background. &gt;&gt; She's got pink glasses. You got blue. &gt;&gt; You see things differently. Now, that is a part of getting married. And what's an amazing thing is my wife and I now 52 years, we start thinking alike. &gt;&gt; I could tell you some things that because the closer we are and the older we are together, we've become one. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, the mind is the womb of the spirit. I'm going to go on. Spoken word is the original seed. Paragraph 184. And when the bride of Jesus Christ lets man-made creeds and dogmas take the place of the word of God, she's committing adultery. When the bride of Christ, that's creeds, dogmas, take place of the word, she's committed adultery. Brother Bram said, how does a church, a man, a people, a nation commit spiritual adultery on Christ? He said when you listen direct quote when you by the intercourse of your mind he says knowing better by the word of God add to or taking away from the word of God you're absolutely committing spiritual adultery on Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's why he brother Brennham said it's blasphemous names. It's seducing spirits. It's enticing spirits. &gt;&gt; It's sexual spirits. It's unclean. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Religious spirits have sexual connotations. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let that sink in. Paragraph 186. What is it? The mind is the woman of the spirit. What? Take in or let out. That's how commit adultery. It's taking let some Satan devil spirit put in them something against the word of God. Then she's committed adultery. End time seed sign 1962. Musicians, you come. I'm starting to close. I am not closing, but I'm starting to. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The womb of her heart, the womb that her spirit was in. Your womb of your spirit is your mind. Your mind is that channel. You've got five senses that control the body. You got five senses that control the soul. It says your soul, body, and spirit. Then come the one channel avenue. One way into that your own free moral agency. That's it. You can receive or reject and you do whatever you want to do. Now, let's go back to that graph if I could. the three circles. No, go uh yeah, go to the one with the womb on it. Yeah. Now, Brother Bram said that Jesus said, "My words are spirit, their life, and he that receiveth my words receiveth my life." Through the hearing of the gate, you hear the word of God. Faith cometh by hearing. Hearing the word comes through into the mind. If you're not careful, that's where the seed is aborted. I don't believe it. &gt;&gt; So, it's aborted right there. But if you say, "No, I believe it." And you let it go beyond the mind and come into the soul, into the heart of man, thy word, oh God, have I hid in my heart. And he says, "Then the seed is germmitized." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Came through the hearing gate, went through the mind up into the" and he said, "But right here is the will and that's your will." &gt;&gt; Do you know what that God being an almighty God, &gt;&gt; there's one thing he cannot do. &gt;&gt; He cannot overpower your will. No, &gt;&gt; he waits until your will agrees with his. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, &gt;&gt; not my will, thine be done. &gt;&gt; You understand it? &gt;&gt; So each one of you are given free moral agency &gt;&gt; to accept or reject. I believe it, I don't believe it. You can be raised around this message. You can know its precepts, its concept. It can be just a religious way to you. It's just long dresses, long hair, no makeup, etc. It's just a law. It's not a life. It's a law. And therefore, you get old enough, you get out of the house, you get married, you might even go along for a while until finally say, "I just don't believe it." Do you see what I'm saying? God does not take you against your will. &gt;&gt; Satan does. &gt;&gt; Satan's a rapist. &gt;&gt; God is a gentleman. &gt;&gt; Doesn't force himself upon you. &gt;&gt; He waits. He waits until you say, "Okay, Lord, come into my heart. Lord Jesus doesn't take you according against your will. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He waits. So you have the ability to accept or reject. The Apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 11, "I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present to you as a chasteed virgin to Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as a serpent begal Eve through his subtlety, so your minds, what is the mind? Womb to the spirit. So your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom you've not preached, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit which you have not received, or another gospel which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him. Wow. Eve had all kinds of mind battles, &gt;&gt; but when she stopped to reason it, &gt;&gt; that's when he took her. &gt;&gt; He said he took her and seduced her. Do you know what beguiled means? &gt;&gt; Woman, what happened to you? The serpent. He beguiled me. Do you know what beguiled means? He seduced me with words. &gt;&gt; Words. God uses words. Satan uses words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He beguiled me. Wow. &gt;&gt; Another gospel. Imagination. The inlet to your spirit. Many Christians within this message have all kinds of problems with their own imagination. Yeah, it's true. Let your own imagination run wild. Let me tell you, it it'll cause you to hit the ditch. Yeah. I I I can't imagine, brother Ron. Imagination, mind battles, affections, memory, imaginations, conscience. Let's go to affection for a moment. tender attachments, something you have a desire for. Some of you, some of you are having problems walking in a sanctified life. Why? Because your affections are not set on things above. Well, I'd like a bigger I'd like a better job. Okay, you get a better job, got to work more hours. I'd like to have better house. Okay, cost more money. Got to work more hours. I like a better car. Okay. Got to work more for that. Pretty soon till you're caught up in the rat race until my goodness, I don't have no time for nothing. I can't hunt, fish, can't do the things that I want to do. Don't have time to spend with my family. Why? Because the Bible says I need to provide for my family. &gt;&gt; And you get caught up in the rat race of your affections. Sometimes your affections get you out of God's will and you get out here and then you wonder why. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'd like to have just the old simple life. Wow, I'm so sick of working. Oh, I'd like to have a little shack somewhere. It paid off. take the kids hunting and fishing and have a horse to ride and just Oh, wouldn't that be nice? You get all this stuff. Well, your affections. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these other things." &gt;&gt; All these affections you got. Colossians 3 1-5. Then if you be risen with Christ, if you be risen with Christ, are you listening? If you be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above. Where Christ is siteth on the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, not on the things of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God, when Christ, who is our life, shall appear. Then ye shall also appear with him in glory. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, and uncleanness, and inordinate affection. Inordinate, improper affection, earthly affections. Do you know that the cares of life can choke the seed &gt;&gt; to make it unfruitful? &gt;&gt; Didn't say sin. said just the cares of life. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you allow these affections that you have and these desires and stuff that you hold dear. Well, I'd like to have We were in Vonatu and there was a a man sitting next to his boat and he went out and caught just a few fish that day and he took it to the market. Freddy, you only had four or five fish. And he went to the market and he sold his fish and he sat down next to his boat and had a hammock. He got in the hammock and he just sway in there back and forth. And one of the real rich guys came by and said, "Hey, what are you doing?" Yeah, I went fishing. He said, "Well, you what you need is a bigger boat. You get a bigger boat, you get more fish, and you can fish all day. When you come back, you he says, "And then you'll have more time to take time off." He said, "No, I have more time right now. Why do I want a bigger boat? &gt;&gt; It's too simple." &gt;&gt; Huh? I'd like to take all of you to Vanuatu. Probably most of you wouldn't come back. What do you What do you do for work? Me grow. Yeah. Me grow. You plant anything over there. The ground is so fertile. Anything grows. You don't have to tend to it. Just go out there, put the seed in, come back a little bit later, take out the taro root, guava and mango and the stuff. Hey, you know, seems pretty good. Oh, it's it's a simple life. Their houses. They just go out and, you know, a hurricane comes home, the thatched roof is gone, the wind, the walls are blown over. Three days later, the hurricane's gone. Guess what? They just go build another one in two, three days. No big deal. Life just comes and goes. Understand all of these memory, imagination, conscience. What about your conscience? Any of you ever do something wrong and your conscience affects you? I shouldn't have done that. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't do Go make that right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And some people say, "I don't have no that don't bother my conscience. I can cut my hair. I can paint my my nails. I can have a manicure. I can wear makeup. Don't bother me a bit." Brother Brim said, "You got no more conscience than a snake's got hips. &gt;&gt; Don't bother me." He says, "I doubt your seed &gt;&gt; or you've had your conscience seared. Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you think the world is out here? Why they're doing what they're doing? They're conscience seared. &gt;&gt; Does it bother them to do those things? No. They take pleasure in what they're doing. [Music] &gt;&gt; So here I'm going to give you the I'm closing now. I am give you two more quotes. Both of them from scripture. You want to know how to overcome? &gt;&gt; You want to know the key? Here's here's the key to overcoming. your mind battles. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 10:es 3-5. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations, &gt;&gt; and everything that exaltth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought, &gt;&gt; your mind battle, bring every thought &gt;&gt; to the obedience of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Take it captive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That ain't the way God thinks. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; That's the enemy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Taking every thought. &gt;&gt; Philippians 4 6-9. Be careful for nothing. For in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, If there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these &gt;&gt; things. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Your problem is some of you think too much. &gt;&gt; I would hate to be some of your brains cuz some of you you Well, what if Well, what about what do we do when we get there? What if the bridge is is blown up? What if? What if? What if? What if? What if? What if? &gt;&gt; Are we there yet? Hey, hang on. Hang on. &gt;&gt; Keep going. &gt;&gt; The word, oh Lord, is a lamp unto my feet. &gt;&gt; Any of you ever walked with a com or a lantern and you walk through the bush? How far do you see? &gt;&gt; Just a few steps. But Brian, when when you take a step with the lamp, what does the light do? &gt;&gt; I just keep going. &gt;&gt; I'll walk in the light as he is in the light. So you just keep walking. Guess what? Light goes before you. &gt;&gt; Keep going. &gt;&gt; Thy word, oh Lord, is a lamp unto my feet. &gt;&gt; Therefore, let me walk &gt;&gt; by faith. Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't see the end where I'm going with a lantern. It doesn't It's not a spotlight out there where you can see two miles away and there's your destination. No, it's a lamb and you follow the the the trail and it's it's got valleys and it's got hills and it's got trees and it may have a few obstacles for you to go around, but you know what? doesn't show you the end of the road, but if you keep walking, &gt;&gt; you'll make it. &gt;&gt; How do you make it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One step at a time. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints of God. I trust that when because when you start looking at the message, brother Brennham refers back to this chart. And he says it depends on the level that you're living with God. &gt;&gt; Has he come down to the control room? Maybe some of you have been round raised around this message. Maybe you're you're really wondering, is it really for me? &gt;&gt; Wrestle with the angel. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is it for you? &gt;&gt; Huh? Or is it because mom and dad? &gt;&gt; I've got some young people that come to this church and their parents are not believers or have left the message. &gt;&gt; And I think God bless those &gt;&gt; young people. &gt;&gt; Because you young people, what if your mom and dad rejected it? Would you reject it? What if they said, "Ah, ain't nothing to it. I've seen a lot of them do it." &gt;&gt; I just ask you, is this message your message? &gt;&gt; Do you embrace it and say, "God sent unto me Elijah." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not turning back. If none, go with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to turn back. &gt;&gt; Though none go with me, &gt;&gt; still will I follow. &gt;&gt; If my friends forsake me, &gt;&gt; still will I follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the church turns back, &gt;&gt; still will I &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why are you here? &gt;&gt; Is it because your friends are here? Is it because you you you meet people and you got Well, it's good. I want you to have friends here. But what if your friends don't come here anymore? Well, maybe I'll move because I want to go be with my friends. Then you don't have a revelation of where your post of duty is at. &gt;&gt; Did God call you here? &gt;&gt; If God's called you here, there should be a revelation. Upon this rock, I'll build my church. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; No. This this where I'm called. It's &gt;&gt; my post of duty. &gt;&gt; Amen. I had a brother tell me the other day, "Brother Ron, I'm sorry to tell you, you're stuck with me." &gt;&gt; He said, "I ain't going nowhere." I said, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say to all of you, you're stuck with me. &gt;&gt; I ain't going anywhere. I ain't looking for a bigger church. I ain't looking for more people. I ain't looking for an opportunity when opportunity arise and maybe somebody else loses a church and it's a bigger church. I sorry. See you. Adios. Sayanara. I'll see you later. No. No. I'm here. I'm here for the long haul. &gt;&gt; God called me to this place. God called me to you. &gt;&gt; He did. While I was in the forest of Germany, the Lord spoke to me. Go to Phoenix and start a church. &gt;&gt; He told the Apostle Paul, "I've got much seed in this city. Go seek whom's worthy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. God bless you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Create in me a clean heart. &gt;&gt; Create in me a clean heart. Oh God, I renew our spirit. [Music] We are we are [Music] God and renew the right spirit within me. Cast me not away. Oh, not away from thy presence. Take not Holy Spirit from me. [Music] [Applause] [Music] to me the joy of my salvation as we do arise dearity. [Music] Sometimes you lose the joy of your salvation. Go through trials. Somebody says something, somebody hurts you, you get offended. Who hasn't been offended? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; You know what's funny is all of us say, "I've been offended. So and so, he said this and offended me." What about you? Have you offended somebody else? &gt;&gt; You ever said something sharp and uncaring and unkind, inconsiderate to somebody else? You might have offended somebody else. So much of the time, we're so self-righteous, we look at everybody else. You offended me. What about you? A kind word turns away wrath. &gt;&gt; If somebody slaps you on the cheek, slap them harder. What does it say? &gt;&gt; Turn the cheek. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Eric, that's hard to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I tell you what, come here, buddy. You want the right hand of fellowship?

Finally, my pastor said, "All right, all right. You're here so early. Why don't I give you a key, let you open up?" Yeah, great. That's great. You know what we used to do before anybody came to church? Brother Neil, do you like opening up? Isn't it something about coming into the building? Nobody's here. You feel his presence. You know what we used to do? &gt;&gt; Nobody's here. I used to lay hands on the chairs &gt;&gt; and I'd say, "Father, whoever sits here today, &gt;&gt; anoint them." Amen. &gt;&gt; Whoever sits on this row, &gt;&gt; I sit here and I lay my hands on I say, "God, God, &gt;&gt; whoever comes here today, &gt;&gt; let the revelation be quickened to them." &gt;&gt; I'd pray over the chair. &gt;&gt; So, whoever sat there, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been a fanatic for this message ever since I came to it. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Never talked to him about the Diamondbacks or whoever. Uh-uh. I don't talk about snakes. Diamond back, the rattlers. Nah, stop it. Talk about the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I love about you people that you pull on it. I told Brother Eric, I said, "Brother Eric," I said, "You know what I like you about you?" I says, "Cuz I I I said, you know what? When something really strikes you, &gt;&gt; you don't wait for somebody else." Well, let me see. &gt;&gt; Anybody say an amen? &gt;&gt; No. It's his voice comes out. &gt;&gt; And you know what you're doing, brother Eric? Do you know what you're doing when you do that? You're pulling that sermon out of me. I feel it. I feel it. That's why I make eye contact with some of you during service. Unless you're falling asleep, but I make eye contact with you because you know what? You know what it's doing, Nicholas? You're pulling it from me. &gt;&gt; Come on. Tell me my inheritance. Come on, man. Yes, sir. Amen. Come on. Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz something inside of you is saying, "I want it. I want it. It's my inheritance. Tell me more." &gt;&gt; Amen.
