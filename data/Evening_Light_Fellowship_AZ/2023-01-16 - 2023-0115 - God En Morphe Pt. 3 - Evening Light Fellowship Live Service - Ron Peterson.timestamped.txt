[49:39] in spirit and in truth
[49:42] thank you Father for all that you have

[49:46] but most of all of what you're doing
[49:48] right now
[49:50] father I pray now come and anoint the
[49:53] word to us
[49:55] open our eyes of understanding
[49:58] that we might see you
[50:00] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[50:03] amen
[50:05] amen praise the Lord God bless you all
[50:08] this morning certainly enjoyed the song
[50:10] specials God bless them let's just
[50:13] remain standing all of you have been
[50:15] greeted let me just go directly into the
[50:18] service
[50:18] but each and every one but I saw Vicki
[50:21] Buckingham God bless her she snuck in
[50:24] here
[50:28] amen
[50:32] this uh scripture there in Deuteronomy
[50:35] is is quite astounding Deuteronomy 10
[50:38] verse 17.
[50:41] for the Lord your God
[50:45] is God of Gods
[50:48] okay your God
[50:50] somebody say my God
[50:52] [Applause]
[50:53] you see you got to make it personal my
[50:56] God is the god of God there are many
[50:59] gods
[51:01] and there are many lords
[51:03] but my God
[51:05] is the god of Gods
[51:09] for the Lord your God is God of gods and
[51:12] Lord of lords a great God a mighty and a
[51:17] terrible
[51:18] which regardeth not persons nor taketh
[51:23] reward
[51:25] turn with me to First Corinthians now
[51:28] First Corinthians chapter 8.
[51:31] verses 5 through 6.
[51:39] for though there be
[51:42] that are called gods
[51:46] whether in heaven or
[51:48] or in earth as
[51:50] there be God's many and Lord's many
[51:54] but to us there is but one God
[52:00] amen hallelujah
[52:02] I get excited when I read stuff like
[52:04] that
[52:06] because the Bible says yeah look there's
[52:08] many gods
[52:10] and if you've traveled around the world
[52:11] you've been to places like India Africa
[52:14] or whatever you will see there are
[52:16] multitudes of Gods
[52:20] but there is a God of Gods
[52:26] ah but they're
[52:29] but to us there is but one God the
[52:32] father of whom are all things
[52:35] and we in him and our Lord Jesus Christ
[52:39] by whom are all things
[52:43] and we
[52:44] by him
[52:46] can you say Amen to that yes turn back
[52:50] with me Romans chapter 8.
[52:52] Romans 8
[52:57] verses 14 through 19.
[53:03] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[53:06] God they are the sons of God
[53:11] for ye have not received the spirit of
[53:13] bondage again to fear
[53:16] but ye have received the spirit of
[53:18] adoption
[53:21] whereby we cry Abba Father
[53:26] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[53:29] our spirit
[53:31] that we are the children of God
[53:34] and if children than heirs Heirs of God
[53:36] and join ears with Christ
[53:39] if so be that we suffer with him
[53:42] that we may be also
[53:45] glorified together
[53:51] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[53:54] present time are not worthy to be
[53:55] compared
[53:57] with the glory which shall be revealed
[54:02] where is it going to be revealed
[54:04] in US
[54:06] the glory which shall be revealed in us
[54:10] for the earnest expectation
[54:13] of the creature wadeth
[54:16] for the manifestation
[54:18] of the sons of God
[54:24] can you hear it
[54:27] they're saying come on
[54:31] come on
[54:33] amen if you're listening the spirit of
[54:36] God is wooing each one every son and
[54:40] daughter of God to get into their
[54:42] position
[54:44] may God add the blessing the reading of
[54:46] his word you can be seated this morning
[54:47] in God's presence
[54:51] brother Brennan took that one scripture
[54:54] there of talking about the creation
[54:56] growneth and waited for the
[54:58] manifestation of the sons of God he said
[55:01] he preached a whole sermon on it called
[55:03] birth pains
[55:04] and he said what it is all that you're
[55:07] seeing in the world today
[55:09] and all that is happening from
[55:12] earthquakes to blackouts to tsunamis
[55:17] to all of those things he said what it
[55:19] is is the Earth is tremoring
[55:22] she's convulsing
[55:25] she's ready to bring forth a whole
[55:29] another world
[55:32] that's why this kingdom is fracturing
[55:35] it's all falling apart it's got to
[55:38] praise God be we have a kingdom that
[55:41] cannot be shook
[55:46] Jesus said clearly my Kingdom's not of
[55:49] this world
[55:51] Hallelujah I'm glad I'm a
[55:53] citizen of another kingdom
[55:56] brother Bram said that's why here
[55:59] you don't have it so easy
[56:02] you got to be tested and tried
[56:04] amen every son and daughter of God is
[56:07] going to be tested and tried to see
[56:08] really what is your Revelation made of
[56:11] amen I'm going to continue on I'm going
[56:14] to try to finish this uh thought uh that
[56:19] God has been dealing with me on but then
[56:21] I'm going to launch out actually you
[56:24] know on brother Paul Halen God bless you
[56:25] it's good to have you here but every
[56:27] Minister knows your sermon never really
[56:29] finishes
[56:31] because what what God does is he keeps
[56:34] unfolding and you go from one Revelation
[56:36] to another Revelation to another
[56:39] revelation
[56:42] and so uh even as God is unfolding to
[56:46] you and even as the word unfolds to the
[56:49] minister
[56:51] what happens uh I mean I could probably
[56:54] title this this is Jesus Christ the same
[56:57] yesterday today and forever part
[57:01] 3625 uh because what it is it's a
[57:05] never-ending story
[57:07] Hallelujah in fact I tell you how
[57:10] Eternal it is
[57:12] brother Brenham said God is so great
[57:14] that it will take an eternity for God to
[57:18] reveal himself and so what you are
[57:21] catching is just the tip of the iceberg
[57:26] we can't fathom how great he is
[57:29] but he's almighty God
[57:32] and he is great for sure
[57:35] okay we're titling this God in Martha
[57:39] part three
[57:41] God in Martha part three and I'll take
[57:44] the subject this morning
[57:46] of Christ in you becomes a manifested
[57:50] son or daughter
[57:53] so we're talking about manifested Sons
[57:56] we're talking about that God has sent a
[57:59] message here in this day
[58:02] that's going to help you come to the
[58:05] stature of a perfect man
[58:09] that stature is Christ
[58:13] amen so we realize then
[58:18] if I could use these word what God is
[58:21] doing he's cloning himself
[58:25] he's actually taking this
[58:30] this Fallen
[58:32] people
[58:34] and restoring them and redeeming them
[58:38] back to what they were before
[58:41] now if you were never before you will
[58:45] never be after
[58:49] let that sink in
[58:52] because brother Branham said if you are
[58:55] a son of God if you ever have been
[58:59] or ever will be it's because you were in
[59:03] the mind of God in the beginning
[59:06] and he says and so you really have no
[59:10] choice
[59:11] now yes you choose but let me say this
[59:14] you think that you were seeking God
[59:18] is seeking you God came down looking
[59:21] after you God came to you you didn't
[59:24] come to him
[59:27] amen
[59:29] so I want to continue this thought of
[59:32] God in morpha
[59:35] and how that God changes
[59:38] his masks down through all the ages
[59:43] now sometimes we have
[59:46] a hard time understanding how God
[59:50] changes his mass and how he does it
[59:54] but brother Branham says that God is the
[59:56] great author of life
[59:58] he's the author of this book
[1:00:01] and he wrote a part to play for everyone
[1:00:04] from Adam to the last sea
[1:00:09] and so now he has orchestrated this
[1:00:13] since the foundation of the world
[1:00:16] he knew who would and who would not
[1:00:20] because he's author
[1:00:23] can
[1:00:25] clay say unto the Potter why have you
[1:00:28] made me thus
[1:00:30] because the Potter has power over the
[1:00:34] clay to make some vessels of honor and
[1:00:37] some vessels of Dishonor
[1:00:41] but each one of you let me say this this
[1:00:44] great drama
[1:00:45] of God's word this is a play if you
[1:00:48] please
[1:00:50] Genesis 1
[1:00:52] is chapter one of the play
[1:00:55] stage one enter Adam
[1:00:59] you see what I'm saying
[1:01:01] Along Comes Eve
[1:01:04] each one of them are playing a part
[1:01:07] of a great story
[1:01:12] and this story is about how somebody
[1:01:15] fell and how they will be redeemed and
[1:01:18] how they will be restored and how that
[1:01:21] they are going to come back to a
[1:01:23] position that God has given them before
[1:01:25] the foundation of the world
[1:01:31] brother Branham comes along and gives us
[1:01:33] words and terminology called the see
[1:01:36] Gene of God
[1:01:40] and then we can break it down and talk
[1:01:42] about the DNA of God
[1:01:48] in fact
[1:01:51] Stephen love all bought me a book here
[1:01:54] years ago and you see the scientists are
[1:01:57] breaking into
[1:01:59] the great Laboratory
[1:02:01] and the booklet he gave me is called the
[1:02:04] god Gene
[1:02:07] and it's amazing how close they come to
[1:02:11] it
[1:02:12] now brother Branham says that they are
[1:02:14] breaking down
[1:02:15] into the laboratory they're looking
[1:02:17] through science
[1:02:20] through medicine
[1:02:22] microscopically now I want you to
[1:02:24] understand it doesn't matter if you look
[1:02:27] into the great Beyond in outer space
[1:02:32] or you come down from the finite to the
[1:02:37] infinite
[1:02:38] and you begin to to look even as those
[1:02:43] great minds in our day said everywhere
[1:02:46] we look
[1:02:47] whether it is the outer reaches of space
[1:02:50] or we come and we look and we go down
[1:02:54] down down down we still see everywhere
[1:02:57] the fingerprint of God
[1:03:00] Hallelujah
[1:03:02] because he's the creator of all things
[1:03:04] the prophet of God said I went to find
[1:03:07] God I didn't know him I I wasn't raised
[1:03:10] in a in a Christian home I didn't go to
[1:03:13] church he said but they began as a young
[1:03:15] boy something inside of him a deep
[1:03:18] calling to the deep and there was a deep
[1:03:21] out there to respond and he said
[1:03:23] yes
[1:03:25] I wanted to know that God
[1:03:28] I saw him in nature
[1:03:31] he says so I wrote him a letter
[1:03:36] and I put it on a tree
[1:03:40] I believe God came down
[1:03:43] and read his letter
[1:03:46] God knows the very thoughts and intents
[1:03:48] of your heart
[1:03:54] and so this story if you please of God
[1:03:58] in Martha
[1:04:00] God changes his masks
[1:04:04] he says now a lot of times we can see
[1:04:07] what God has done years ago we can see
[1:04:10] God in others but we fail to seek God in
[1:04:12] us
[1:04:14] and he says we can look back and we can
[1:04:17] see how that the spirit of Christ watch
[1:04:20] this because Christ is the anointing
[1:04:23] he said watch the spirit of Christ in
[1:04:26] David playing out his part
[1:04:29] he said watch the spirit of Christ in
[1:04:32] Boaz
[1:04:34] playing his part
[1:04:36] watch the part of Christ and he goes to
[1:04:40] all of the different figures that he
[1:04:43] desires to and he says what was it he
[1:04:46] says it was the almighty author
[1:04:49] orchestrating
[1:04:51] their life and they didn't know it
[1:04:53] because the steps of the righteous are
[1:04:56] what they're ordered of the Lord you
[1:04:58] didn't know it but God knew what you
[1:05:00] would be like he knew your nature he
[1:05:02] knew everything about you and guess what
[1:05:05] he knew your faults and failures and he
[1:05:08] loved you in spite of yourself
[1:05:12] that ought to make all of you happy
[1:05:15] because it wasn't by your works
[1:05:18] it was by his election
[1:05:21] now
[1:05:22] we go back and we see in the sermon the
[1:05:25] breach brother Brenham he picks this up
[1:05:27] let me show you quickly
[1:05:29] speaking of Adam and when he lost his
[1:05:32] life
[1:05:34] he also lost his inheritance in life
[1:05:37] because he had completely Supreme
[1:05:40] control of the earth he was God of the
[1:05:42] Earth
[1:05:43] and the God and gods the god of the
[1:05:46] universe everywhere
[1:05:48] but his son had his Earth under his own
[1:05:52] control
[1:05:56] can we also think about this Earth
[1:06:01] thy will be done
[1:06:03] in this earth
[1:06:06] as it is in heaven
[1:06:09] he could speak he could name he could
[1:06:11] say he could stop nature
[1:06:13] he didn't do anything he wanted to see
[1:06:16] when he did that he lost his inheritance
[1:06:21] now Adam could say let this mountain
[1:06:23] here be moved over there and it would
[1:06:26] and it would do it
[1:06:28] Adam could say let this tree be plicked
[1:06:31] up and planted over here
[1:06:33] it would do it see
[1:06:35] for he had complete Supreme control
[1:06:38] as a minor God under God our Father
[1:06:43] because he was the son of God
[1:06:47] are you catching the pattern now
[1:06:51] when Adam fell in the garden he had lost
[1:06:55] his eternal life
[1:06:58] he lost his dominion over the animals
[1:07:02] he lost his position in place
[1:07:05] that God had put him in
[1:07:08] and he lost his right to the Tree of
[1:07:11] Life
[1:07:13] and see by the Bible says that by the
[1:07:16] Disobedience of one all became sinners
[1:07:20] and by The Obedience of one
[1:07:24] we all became redeemed back to God
[1:07:28] so the central theme all throughout the
[1:07:30] Bible is God's Plan of Redemption
[1:07:34] and restoration and what Adam and Eve
[1:07:37] did not finish in the beginning
[1:07:40] someone will
[1:07:44] let's get excited about it
[1:07:46] Oh Happy Day
[1:07:49] Hallelujah
[1:07:52] the Bible says in First John 3 verses 1
[1:07:54] and 2 behold the manner of
[1:07:57] love the father hath bestowed upon us
[1:08:00] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:08:03] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:08:08] because it knew him not beloved now are
[1:08:14] we the sons of God and it does not yet
[1:08:17] appear what we shall be but we know that
[1:08:22] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:08:27] him for we shall see him as he is
[1:08:31] Hallelujah listen let's not try to
[1:08:34] speculate how it's going to be what it's
[1:08:37] going to be like and I I really I don't
[1:08:39] care to encumber my mind with those
[1:08:43] things uh theological discussions
[1:08:47] sometimes it's okay but you'll get into
[1:08:49] a an argument with a man where he's
[1:08:52] coming on a white claw cloud and another
[1:08:54] says he's coming on a a White Horse He
[1:08:57] said hey quit disagreeing about whether
[1:09:00] it's a cloud or a horse just agree he's
[1:09:03] coming
[1:09:04] Hallelujah don't let your mind get all
[1:09:06] encumbered with different things how is
[1:09:09] it going to be let me tell you and I'm
[1:09:11] gonna I'm gonna say something now that I
[1:09:14] don't want to stumble you but he says
[1:09:16] the the Rapture of the church is already
[1:09:19] taking place
[1:09:21] it's not a certain event
[1:09:25] you know a lot of times they'll say well
[1:09:27] it's just the catching away you've
[1:09:29] already been caught up you were already
[1:09:31] cut away Hallelujah when this message
[1:09:34] came it grabbed you by force it shook
[1:09:37] you like a bulldog with a rag
[1:09:41] thank you Lord they turn you around it
[1:09:44] took your world upside down
[1:09:46] Hallelujah why God's going to bring you
[1:09:49] to where he wants you to be
[1:09:54] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:10:00] I don't know how it'll be
[1:10:03] I know this I'll be like him
[1:10:06] and I'll know him
[1:10:09] as he is known
[1:10:13] it is the love of God that has placed
[1:10:16] upon those who are called the sons of
[1:10:18] God
[1:10:21] and I like to always look and remind you
[1:10:25] that wherever you see him appear
[1:10:28] she appears
[1:10:31] it's all down through the scripture
[1:10:35] now Romans 8 verses 14 and 19.
[1:10:43] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:10:46] God they are the sons of God
[1:10:50] you have not received the spirit of
[1:10:52] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:10:53] received the spirit of adoption
[1:10:57] now I know I'm reading this again but
[1:10:59] this for a purpose
[1:11:02] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:11:04] our spirits that we are the children of
[1:11:06] God
[1:11:08] and if children than heirs Heirs of God
[1:11:10] join heirs with Christ
[1:11:13] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:11:16] may
[1:11:17] be also glorified together
[1:11:21] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:11:24] present time
[1:11:25] are not worthy to become thank you
[1:11:29] compared with the glory
[1:11:32] which shall be revealed in US
[1:11:40] she
[1:11:42] is his glory
[1:11:45] for we know that the woman is the glory
[1:11:50] of her man
[1:11:55] he
[1:11:57] is not perfect
[1:11:59] without her
[1:12:03] she compliments him
[1:12:07] she fulfills him
[1:12:13] she is the reason for his being
[1:12:21] Hallelujah
[1:12:23] he wanted to have a family
[1:12:26] he wanted to be God
[1:12:29] why would you not be the most important
[1:12:32] thing
[1:12:34] of the whole scripture
[1:12:36] because
[1:12:38] without you
[1:12:40] he would not be
[1:12:43] but because he was
[1:12:45] therefore
[1:12:47] I am
[1:12:50] no
[1:12:52] whoa my God my God how that I love you
[1:12:58] whoa crazy
[1:13:02] for the earnest expectation the creature
[1:13:04] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[1:13:06] of God manifestation
[1:13:08] apocalypsis
[1:13:11] it means
[1:13:13] an appearing or a coming a manifestation
[1:13:16] to be revealed
[1:13:19] a revelation
[1:13:21] that comes to manifestation
[1:13:26] Revelation in your life is not to lie
[1:13:29] dormant
[1:13:31] it is to manifest
[1:13:33] it is to bring forth it is to energize
[1:13:37] into to Quicken you amen because we see
[1:13:42] that you are right now being transformed
[1:13:45] and the power of that transformation is
[1:13:47] faith never forget that that by faith
[1:13:51] are you being changed from one glory to
[1:13:53] another Hallelujah
[1:13:59] it's already started
[1:14:02] the Rapture has already begun shout's
[1:14:04] already gone past
[1:14:08] we're already caught up
[1:14:10] I say this if you're not caught up now I
[1:14:12] doubt you'll be caught up later
[1:14:17] when you hear his voice by way of
[1:14:20] Revelation it transforms you from sinner
[1:14:23] to Saint
[1:14:25] transforms you from Earthly to
[1:14:28] heavenly
[1:14:31] from terrestrial to celestial
[1:14:36] and the scripture says because if we
[1:14:38] have borne the image of the earthy we
[1:14:42] shall also bear the image of the
[1:14:44] Heavenly Hallelujah
[1:14:46] thank God
[1:14:55] in the sermon adoption just go along
[1:14:58] with me if you would here for a moment
[1:15:00] 1960
[1:15:03] . now I've often said when you
[1:15:06] read or listen to The Prophet's sermons
[1:15:10] the sermons are declarations
[1:15:15] so when he's talking about adoption
[1:15:18] he's actually taking something out of
[1:15:21] the scriptures bringing it down and
[1:15:24] saying here we are in a time of adoption
[1:15:28] follow along we are living in the last
[1:15:31] days the top of the pyramid the cross
[1:15:34] fishes of the cancer age and the Zodiac
[1:15:37] and the time and the coming of Leo the
[1:15:39] Lion and the capping Stone
[1:15:41] in the days of the manifestations of the
[1:15:44] sons of God in the Bible see where we're
[1:15:47] at we're right at the end time
[1:15:51] and the prophet of God said the end time
[1:15:54] message
[1:15:56] meets the end time conditions let me
[1:15:59] tell you there's no devil can stop you
[1:16:02] there is nothing that is going to keep
[1:16:04] you short of you becoming what you need
[1:16:07] to become Hallelujah now we are living
[1:16:10] below our privileges because we have a
[1:16:13] doubt in our mind of really who we are
[1:16:16] and the prophet of God said when the
[1:16:18] true bride begins to catch a true
[1:16:19] revelation of who she is wake up mama
[1:16:22] listen you got to realize that's me
[1:16:26] and when she begins to catch this
[1:16:29] revelation
[1:16:31] and by God's spirit with discern and
[1:16:35] withstand the two Spirits working within
[1:16:40] the framework of the church now I'm not
[1:16:42] talking about out there so much I'm
[1:16:45] talking about something that will
[1:16:46] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:16:48] possible but you cannot deceive the
[1:16:51] elect you know why because they are
[1:16:54] ordained to catch it
[1:16:58] listen you don't have to be a member of
[1:17:00] this church or any other Church you just
[1:17:03] need to be in Christ
[1:17:05] Hallelujah he's orchestrating this thing
[1:17:08] it ain't some local preacher it ain't
[1:17:10] some local church it ain't somebody
[1:17:12] that's got it all unique he's got it and
[1:17:16] when you're in him
[1:17:18] you got it
[1:17:24] Hallelujah I feel like preaching
[1:17:28] adoption chapter four God since the
[1:17:30] beginning of the world
[1:17:32] predestinated us through the adoption of
[1:17:34] sons now the whole creation groaning
[1:17:37] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:17:39] sons of God oh I'd imagine Paul had a
[1:17:42] wonderful time I like to have been there
[1:17:44] with him wouldn't you
[1:17:46] Hallelujah adoption uh the next
[1:17:49] paragraph
[1:17:50] now go right back to Genesis to the
[1:17:53] original what is it
[1:17:54] the world of nature is groaning crying
[1:17:58] everything
[1:17:59] moving what
[1:18:01] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:18:04] when true Sons born Sons filled Sons
[1:18:09] speak and their word is backed
[1:18:12] I believe we're on the border of it
[1:18:14] right now
[1:18:15] in fact brother Branham says you all
[1:18:17] know what I've been waiting on he said
[1:18:20] it's that third pull he says I've told
[1:18:23] you about it my for many years now in
[1:18:25] fact he preaches about it his first
[1:18:27] sermon what is a vision
[1:18:29] he said no watch that third pull he
[1:18:32] talks about fishing and all of those
[1:18:34] things listen saints of God that vision
[1:18:39] understand this
[1:18:41] was a vision of his own Ministry
[1:18:46] of the things he would go through
[1:18:49] and it was a vision about who he's
[1:18:52] trying to catch
[1:18:54] not some little fish
[1:18:57] but he said I'm looking for those
[1:18:58] rainbow trout he says now he says the
[1:19:01] reason I got all these carnal
[1:19:03] impersonators why I tried to teach
[1:19:05] Pentecostal babies Supernatural things
[1:19:09] Hallelujah let's quit trying to educate
[1:19:13] and get people revelated get people into
[1:19:16] the rebel oh my goodness you can't teach
[1:19:20] them into it
[1:19:26] Hallelujah
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:34] manifestation true Sons born son's
[1:19:36] filled
[1:19:38] we're on the border of it right now
[1:19:42] amen oh waiting groaning all nature
[1:19:46] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:19:48] sons of God God ordained
[1:19:50] it at the beginning he gave man to
[1:19:53] Dominion
[1:19:54] the domain
[1:19:56] now I
[1:19:58] before I go any further
[1:20:00] I feel led to bring
[1:20:04] an admonishment
[1:20:07] or
[1:20:09] how do I want to say it
[1:20:11] a warning
[1:20:15] and because if you're not careful the
[1:20:19] devil will take
[1:20:21] what God is doing
[1:20:23] and he says watch he says he will either
[1:20:27] try to get you to go this way
[1:20:30] or go that way he said either make you
[1:20:33] formal and Powerless ritualistic huh
[1:20:38] just starchy church goers or you will
[1:20:42] become so fanatical
[1:20:44] huh so spiritual you're of no earthly
[1:20:48] value
[1:20:52] you don't have to pray to get out of bed
[1:20:55] you don't have to ask God whether or not
[1:20:59] you should get in your car and go to
[1:21:01] church
[1:21:03] god listen there are things you have to
[1:21:07] do
[1:21:08] anyway let's just go on
[1:21:11] so let me give you this admonishment
[1:21:15] let me show you a couple quotes and
[1:21:17] we'll go from there
[1:21:19] God's provided
[1:21:21] way of approach to Fellowship
[1:21:24] see man was actually made to be a god
[1:21:28] did you know that
[1:21:31] Jesus said if they called them who the
[1:21:34] word of God came to which was the
[1:21:36] prophets
[1:21:37] if they were Gods how can you condemn me
[1:21:40] when I say I am the son of God
[1:21:43] the prophets were considered gods
[1:21:47] man was made a Lesser God
[1:21:51] and given a domain on the earth I want
[1:21:54] you to understand this man was meant to
[1:21:57] be a god
[1:21:59] but not take God's place
[1:22:04] you're a Lesser God
[1:22:10] that's the reason the world today is
[1:22:13] groaning waiting for the full
[1:22:14] manifestations of the sons of God and
[1:22:18] there's great deep blessed teaching in
[1:22:21] that that someday man will come back
[1:22:24] into his right place
[1:22:26] and his domain will be the Earth
[1:22:30] and he will speak to the tree or to the
[1:22:32] mountain or anything and it'll just go
[1:22:35] in place just like it was intended to be
[1:22:38] we are Fallen creatures
[1:22:41] show us the father and it will suffice
[1:22:44] us man was made to be a god
[1:22:47] his domain is the Earth the whole
[1:22:49] Earth's waiting now for the
[1:22:51] manifestation of the sons of God notice
[1:22:54] brother Branham always
[1:22:55] he always conjoins these two
[1:22:59] that man was made to be a God that's
[1:23:02] what his purpose was on her
[1:23:06] and he says then that the whole creation
[1:23:10] there was his domain is crying out and
[1:23:14] groaning hurry up
[1:23:17] Mother Nature
[1:23:21] needs to slap a few of you
[1:23:25] because you you're slow
[1:23:29] and they're waiting
[1:23:33] everything this whole Mother Earth
[1:23:37] is being ravaged
[1:23:40] and all of her fossil fuels
[1:23:44] and everything and all of her gems and
[1:23:46] mirror minerals in the air and the
[1:23:49] pollutants and everything is so polluted
[1:23:52] she's gagging
[1:23:54] and if you think the mountains are
[1:23:57] pretty now if you think the rivers are
[1:24:00] beautiful now wait till she's cleansed
[1:24:07] she's
[1:24:08] groaning
[1:24:10] waiting
[1:24:12] I want you to understand
[1:24:15] that some of the very ones that caught
[1:24:19] the prophet coming into a manifestation
[1:24:23] were the animals
[1:24:27] a little possum
[1:24:30] we'd come up there and lay on his
[1:24:33] doorstep for days
[1:24:36] and he missed it
[1:24:38] he says well there she is I see it looks
[1:24:42] like she's dying
[1:24:44] he says well I think you know what I'll
[1:24:47] do he's a hunter well I'll just put her
[1:24:49] out of her misery
[1:24:51] and he says some spoke said
[1:24:54] why don't you pray for her that's why
[1:24:56] she came
[1:25:01] that's why she came
[1:25:03] yeah pray for
[1:25:06] and so he went back there back there to
[1:25:08] pray for that little possum what told
[1:25:11] that possum
[1:25:13] where'd it go what told Aunt Jemima to
[1:25:16] stand out there on that street corner
[1:25:20] I is you shooting my woman where it's
[1:25:24] your Elijah
[1:25:26] Hallelujah that little possum Sid I have
[1:25:30] need of someone
[1:25:33] and the spirit of God let that little
[1:25:35] possum to lay there on his doorstep
[1:25:37] little possum little creature of God now
[1:25:41] in the name of Jesus Christ I pray for
[1:25:44] you and he says that she up and stood up
[1:25:48] her little her little baby's on her back
[1:25:51] she turned around to look as if to say
[1:25:55] thank you kind sir
[1:25:57] and went off
[1:26:00] those deer when the prophet of God is
[1:26:03] hunting and usually deer whenever
[1:26:05] there's a hunting season on and they
[1:26:08] hear shots and and and there's hunters
[1:26:10] in the woods it's hard to find them
[1:26:13] because the deer are wary of shots and
[1:26:16] uh somebody's going to shoot them and
[1:26:18] and so after the first couple shots
[1:26:20] opening morning it's hard to find them
[1:26:24] here he is God is rifle and he's hunting
[1:26:27] for him
[1:26:29] and they walk right out of the woods
[1:26:33] he said don't you know I could shoot you
[1:26:34] right now
[1:26:36] she kept coming closer
[1:26:42] that third pull was in him
[1:26:45] the third poll is a revealing of the
[1:26:46] word the third full
[1:26:49] be real sincere this is
[1:26:51] not a public show
[1:26:55] she saw
[1:26:57] a manifestation of a son of man
[1:27:01] do you understand he
[1:27:04] can't help it it's sovereignly coming
[1:27:13] he said every time the manifestation of
[1:27:16] that third pole came it was sovereignly
[1:27:18] given
[1:27:20] let me tell you my brother my sister
[1:27:22] quit trying to manufacture some
[1:27:24] you just wait and go out sovereignly
[1:27:27] there'll become a time in your life
[1:27:29] whatever the issue is maybe that issue
[1:27:32] is what makes him God because you got no
[1:27:35] issues you've got no reason to call on
[1:27:37] him you can become lackadaisical you
[1:27:40] become just religious and you thank God
[1:27:43] but when you have a need you call God on
[1:27:47] the scene the prophet of God said I'm
[1:27:49] sorry but most of the time it takes you
[1:27:53] getting in desperation to call God on
[1:27:56] the scene
[1:27:58] Hallelujah
[1:28:08] if you call them Gods who the word of
[1:28:10] God came to what was a prophet a Divine
[1:28:14] interpreter of the word
[1:28:16] and had the Divine interpretation the
[1:28:18] signs of him foretelling for knowing and
[1:28:21] that was a Vindicated to the people
[1:28:23] that he was a prophet
[1:28:26] and this sermon the Messiah
[1:28:29] Isaiah 9 6. we just won't read it but he
[1:28:33] was the Everlasting father the Mighty
[1:28:35] God
[1:28:36] when God made man in Genesis 1 and 26 it
[1:28:39] shows
[1:28:40] if you're putting the scripture down
[1:28:42] genes 1 26 it shows that God made man to
[1:28:45] be a God to begin with
[1:28:47] man was made to be a god
[1:28:51] a Lesser God he was made in the image
[1:28:56] and likeness of God he had hands like
[1:28:58] God he had feet like God Eyes Ears
[1:29:00] intelligence like God his whole fiber
[1:29:05] because he was a Son of God and Jesus
[1:29:10] referred to him as
[1:29:13] God
[1:29:14] Jesus said how can you condemn me
[1:29:17] saying I the son of God
[1:29:20] isn't it written in your law that you
[1:29:22] are gods
[1:29:23] and if they call those Gods who the word
[1:29:26] of God came to
[1:29:28] how can you condemn me when I say I'm
[1:29:30] the Son of God he was referring to the
[1:29:32] prophets the anointed ones lesser
[1:29:35] anointed
[1:29:36] Jesus was so anointed
[1:29:39] that he was more than a prophet
[1:29:42] Jesus was so anointed till he was the
[1:29:44] fullness of the godhead bodily he was
[1:29:47] God
[1:29:50] the prophets had the same kind of
[1:29:52] anointing only in a lesser
[1:29:54] condition
[1:29:56] in Genesis 1 26 when God made man he
[1:30:00] made him a god
[1:30:02] because he gave him a dominion and he
[1:30:05] had rulership he had power over the
[1:30:08] birds of the air the cattle over the
[1:30:10] winds the waves and the fishes of the
[1:30:12] sea everything
[1:30:14] he had dominion over everything he was a
[1:30:17] ruler anointed a ruler
[1:30:19] because he was in the likeness in the
[1:30:22] image of God
[1:30:24] with an Earthly domain that's why the
[1:30:26] Bible says the Earth is groaning crying
[1:30:29] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:30:32] sons of God the world is waiting
[1:30:35] for the man to come back into his right
[1:30:38] estate
[1:30:41] the world is waiting
[1:30:44] on man to come back to his rightful
[1:30:47] position
[1:30:51] true man was made to be a god
[1:30:55] see the spirit of God inside of you will
[1:30:58] never let you
[1:30:59] here's what I'm coming to
[1:31:01] the spirit of God inside of you will
[1:31:04] never let you
[1:31:06] try to think that you are greater than
[1:31:08] God
[1:31:15] it's true you are like him
[1:31:18] you are born of his bone and flesh of
[1:31:20] his flesh you have the seat Gene of God
[1:31:23] inside of you but you will never be God
[1:31:26] himself
[1:31:29] why because he's the god of Gods
[1:31:38] well I don't want to take anything away
[1:31:40] from what you are
[1:31:42] but let us not take anything away from
[1:31:45] him who is
[1:31:50] he alone is the god of Gods
[1:31:52] he is the almighty God that mind it was
[1:31:55] in Christ has got to be in US
[1:32:00] and when that mind comes into US guess
[1:32:02] what we're about our father's business
[1:32:05] the son can do nothing except the father
[1:32:08] for showing
[1:32:12] Philippians 2 verses 5 through 8 let
[1:32:15] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:32:18] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[1:32:20] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:32:22] with God
[1:32:25] the Philippians were catching this that
[1:32:28] Paul said hey this mind that was in
[1:32:31] Jesus Christ
[1:32:33] let it be in you also
[1:32:39] you see if we're not careful we become
[1:32:42] unbalanced
[1:32:44] by an over emphasizing of something
[1:32:47] instead of staying right in the middle
[1:32:49] of the road
[1:32:54] see we're not if we're not careful what
[1:32:56] happens there's an anointing that will
[1:32:59] get on people and say don't you want to
[1:33:01] be like God
[1:33:04] remember he had that
[1:33:07] sermon also
[1:33:10] don't you want to be like God
[1:33:13] don't you want to know good and evil
[1:33:15] remember now
[1:33:17] they knew no evil
[1:33:20] until after they listened to him
[1:33:24] if you want to be great in the kingdom
[1:33:26] of God Jesus said
[1:33:29] learn to be the servant of All the Way
[1:33:31] Up Is Down
[1:33:35] in fact the closer you get to God the
[1:33:37] more humble you will be
[1:33:40] the more christ-like that you are the
[1:33:42] less arrogant you will be the more that
[1:33:45] you have God in you the less Pride you
[1:33:47] will have in yourself
[1:33:51] amen
[1:33:58] God help us then to never get lifted up
[1:34:01] within ourselves
[1:34:04] or forever to let us think that we are
[1:34:07] equal with God
[1:34:12] I am what I am because he is what he is
[1:34:19] I am what I am because God is my father
[1:34:26] I recognize by Revelation because he
[1:34:29] gave it to me
[1:34:32] do you see
[1:34:34] I'm a Lesser God because I'm getting
[1:34:36] something from my father
[1:34:38] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah Flesh
[1:34:41] and Blood didn't give us to you but your
[1:34:44] father which is in heaven Upon This Rock
[1:34:46] I'll build my church
[1:34:51] God's life dwells within me that makes
[1:34:54] me God in Martha
[1:34:59] but that doesn't
[1:35:01] make me God
[1:35:04] it makes me a god
[1:35:13] what power and authority I have God gave
[1:35:16] it to me
[1:35:17] whatever victories I have it's because
[1:35:20] he is my victory
[1:35:23] whenever Throne I will sit upon
[1:35:26] is because he shared his throne with me
[1:35:32] whatever domain I rule over
[1:35:35] is because he gave it to me to have
[1:35:38] dominion over it
[1:35:41] you will never be God himself
[1:35:45] but you will be his son manifested in
[1:35:48] this world
[1:35:50] you will be a Lesser God
[1:35:54] ye are gods
[1:35:56] that's what the Bible says you are Gods
[1:35:59] but he is the god of Gods
[1:36:03] and just as I had to play a little bit
[1:36:05] of the opposite of that
[1:36:07] this past week and I tell you about the
[1:36:09] gods of this world
[1:36:11] the gods of sports the gods of moons
[1:36:13] movies the gods of rock and roll the
[1:36:16] gods of this world
[1:36:17] we can see them what is God if you
[1:36:21] define God what is God defined as an
[1:36:25] object
[1:36:27] of worship
[1:36:29] are you following that so it goes to
[1:36:32] show you there are two Revelations
[1:36:34] happening right now
[1:36:36] it is two kingdoms in conflict
[1:36:40] there are some that are catching a
[1:36:42] direct Revelation a channel if you
[1:36:45] please coming from heaven
[1:36:48] God is interpenetrating down into this
[1:36:51] dimension
[1:36:52] and you're beginning to catch where you
[1:36:55] come from
[1:36:57] but there's also another dimension
[1:37:00] the prophet of God said hell has had his
[1:37:03] lid ripped off it and demons
[1:37:07] and inspirations
[1:37:10] and all of this and the prophet of God
[1:37:12] said even these movies that are coming
[1:37:15] out he says Where do they get it from
[1:37:18] another dimension
[1:37:25] used to be years ago
[1:37:28] when I was a little boy the werewolf
[1:37:31] wow that scared everybody
[1:37:34] the guy turned his face get real hairy
[1:37:37] and the guy turns into a werewolf and
[1:37:39] starts howling
[1:37:40] you let a nine-year-old kid watch that
[1:37:43] today and he'd laugh at it
[1:37:46] you watch Frankenstein
[1:37:51] kids that laugh at it
[1:37:54] but now
[1:37:58] they're in you know zombies and and
[1:38:02] stuffing people and the Dead Walking
[1:38:06] all of that and uh it's unreal
[1:38:10] what they're feeding their minds upon
[1:38:13] because it's an inspiration so what
[1:38:16] they're doing they're getting inspired
[1:38:17] from Hell itself brother Brenham even
[1:38:21] calls television television
[1:38:24] huh he said because what the vision they
[1:38:27] had down there is inspiring the people's
[1:38:29] minds and they're mega dosing on it if
[1:38:33] he thought I love Susie
[1:38:35] or Lucy
[1:38:37] was bad
[1:38:39] oh that was just a hair brained
[1:38:42] crazy woman
[1:38:47] what would he think of the nonsense
[1:38:50] that's on there today
[1:38:57] now let me say this the Bible says ye
[1:38:59] are Gods to whom
[1:39:01] the word of the Lord came to
[1:39:04] you did not go looking for God God came
[1:39:07] looking for you
[1:39:09] you didn't look for this message this
[1:39:11] message came looking for you you weren't
[1:39:14] praying for God to send a messenger you
[1:39:16] were out there uh seeking where is
[1:39:18] Malachi for where is this angel of
[1:39:21] Revelation 10 no let me tell you that
[1:39:24] messenger came looking for you that
[1:39:27] messenger was ordained to go as Eliza
[1:39:31] was to go and find a bride for Isaac and
[1:39:34] every time he preached he's trying to
[1:39:37] find a bride
[1:39:39] and yet while he speaks his vision here
[1:39:43] is Rebecca coming into the scene I want
[1:39:46] you to understand every time Hallelujah
[1:39:49] this Prophet preaches a sermon
[1:39:54] she's appearing
[1:39:56] she's there she's Baptist she's Lutheran
[1:40:00] she's Pentecostal
[1:40:03] Hallelujah but she's seed by election
[1:40:08] and all he does is say just enough
[1:40:12] she says my God no man speak like that
[1:40:16] man
[1:40:22] you didn't look for this message message
[1:40:24] come looking for you
[1:40:27] remember the story of the
[1:40:30] the slave back in the south
[1:40:33] he had been captured back in the land of
[1:40:37] Africa put on a slave ship brought over
[1:40:39] here
[1:40:41] and was out in the fields working
[1:40:45] and another
[1:40:46] slave owner came and he wanted to see if
[1:40:49] he could buy some slaves
[1:40:52] and he took notice of a certain black
[1:40:54] slave that was out there working
[1:40:58] he worked harder
[1:41:03] he said I want to buy that one
[1:41:06] the boss said oh he ain't for sale
[1:41:09] oh no I I there's something about him
[1:41:12] man I need to get that guy because
[1:41:14] there's something about him
[1:41:17] see people should notice
[1:41:19] when you get hired
[1:41:22] there's something different about you
[1:41:24] because let me tell you how you work for
[1:41:26] your natural Master is how you work for
[1:41:29] your heavenly master
[1:41:33] not just with the
[1:41:36] lip service
[1:41:41] I want that one no he's not for sale
[1:41:44] well Mel what makes him different do you
[1:41:46] feed him different nah he gets the same
[1:41:47] stuff the other guy
[1:41:49] what about where he sleeps now he sleeps
[1:41:52] out in a pen with the rest of them
[1:41:54] whoa
[1:41:56] what is it that makes him different
[1:41:59] he says I was told that his father was a
[1:42:03] king in another land
[1:42:14] and he never forgot
[1:42:16] who his father was
[1:42:19] and so he conducted himself
[1:42:23] as a son of a king
[1:42:26] God help us
[1:42:32] it was a revelation of who he was and
[1:42:35] where he came from that kept him in
[1:42:37] Revelation of who you are it's the power
[1:42:40] that keeps you
[1:42:42] amen
[1:42:44] faith is God's word
[1:42:47] faith in God's word is the power to
[1:42:50] transform your life
[1:42:51] once you know who your father is
[1:42:54] once you know where you come from Once
[1:42:58] you know where you're going it will
[1:43:00] cause you to walk differently talk
[1:43:02] differently and act differently
[1:43:06] in fact this Revelation came to brother
[1:43:08] Branham
[1:43:11] 1965 there in Tucson he preaches a
[1:43:14] sermon called communion
[1:43:17] watch what he says what was it
[1:43:20] he said there was another William
[1:43:22] Branham see
[1:43:24] a little spot of eternal life down there
[1:43:28] from the genes of God
[1:43:30] the word of God that was placed in there
[1:43:33] each one of you can think
[1:43:35] of similar things
[1:43:37] see it was working then look up to the
[1:43:40] trees I think Leaf I've seen you fall
[1:43:44] off last year
[1:43:45] why are you back there again
[1:43:48] where'd you come from what brought you
[1:43:51] here see it was that eternal life
[1:43:54] working in the body
[1:43:56] now that one day as I was walking that
[1:43:59] voice talking don't never smoke drink or
[1:44:03] so forth and the young fellows and all
[1:44:05] got in order all God order
[1:44:10] excuse me
[1:44:12] sometimes what happens
[1:44:15] I get teared up
[1:44:20] and the young fellows and all got older
[1:44:25] see there was something moving
[1:44:29] yet all at once I looked up I said
[1:44:33] not the Sun
[1:44:34] of Charles and Ella Branham
[1:44:39] there's something calling
[1:44:41] I want each one of you to put yourself
[1:44:44] in an exact same position
[1:44:47] you are not the son of your mother and
[1:44:50] father
[1:44:51] you are the sea Gene of God himself and
[1:44:55] there's something inside of you calling
[1:44:58] you
[1:44:59] Hallelujah can you all see him under
[1:45:01] that you have more witness through your
[1:45:04] whole life you've been that odd duckling
[1:45:06] you've been that Oddball you've been the
[1:45:09] eagle in the barnyard you wondered why
[1:45:12] you didn't like the the chicken manure
[1:45:15] why you didn't say oh I'm having a great
[1:45:18] time
[1:45:20] he thought is this really life cluck
[1:45:23] cluck cluck
[1:45:24] until one day Hallelujah he began to see
[1:45:28] a reflection Hallelujah because when he
[1:45:30] went around the Barnyard and the old
[1:45:32] rooster got up there
[1:45:34] oh
[1:45:36] he looked down and he he went
[1:45:40] he did he said that image is different
[1:45:45] from that guy's image
[1:45:50] I am weird
[1:45:56] why do I not fit in
[1:46:00] yeah and so he couldn't deny the shadow
[1:46:03] are you listening to me the shadow was
[1:46:07] telling him who he is and listen you as
[1:46:11] the light came close to you there was a
[1:46:14] shadow
[1:46:15] Hallelujah you are being
[1:46:17] overshadowed by a spirit of God and what
[1:46:21] is he doing he's showing you you're not
[1:46:24] like that you're like this
[1:46:27] and when he saw his own image and then
[1:46:30] one day he hears him
[1:46:34] yes here's something cry he said I
[1:46:37] recognize that
[1:46:39] there's something calling to me
[1:46:43] and he says he searched all over the
[1:46:46] barnyard
[1:46:48] I looked here and there
[1:46:50] he said and I heard it again
[1:46:53] and he said this time I didn't look down
[1:46:56] I looked up
[1:46:58] Hallelujah quit looking down here for
[1:47:01] where you come from quit looking down
[1:47:04] here for your identity your identity is
[1:47:06] not on Earth it's in heaven
[1:47:10] you came from God you're going back to
[1:47:12] God what is it I see my I see my own
[1:47:16] image
[1:47:17] that's where I belong
[1:47:20] all right
[1:47:21] yes sir
[1:47:23] Hallelujah
[1:47:30] something keeps calling me
[1:47:38] every day I see
[1:47:42] he's a reality
[1:47:45] oh God
[1:47:47] my prayer is for everyone here
[1:47:51] including myself
[1:47:53] let this become a greater and greater
[1:47:56] reality of knowing Who We Are
[1:48:02] the devil always tries to hinder what
[1:48:04] God is doing is that right
[1:48:06] when God makes a move Satan makes a
[1:48:08] counter move
[1:48:10] when the enemy comes in a like a flood
[1:48:12] God raises up a standard against it
[1:48:18] now remember now if the devil can't get
[1:48:21] you one way it'll push you off in
[1:48:22] another way
[1:48:25] remember you are gods
[1:48:27] to whom the word of the Lord comes to so
[1:48:30] now we have in the book of Acts chapter
[1:48:32] 14.
[1:48:34] you have Paul and Barnabas and they're
[1:48:36] preaching there's a man on a pallet
[1:48:39] and Paul perceives this man as faith
[1:48:42] he tells him rise up he jumps up he gets
[1:48:46] and he begins to praise God and
[1:48:48] everything and what does man do Acts
[1:48:50] chapter 14 they said this is Jupiter
[1:48:53] this is Saturn these men are are the
[1:48:57] gods come come down in the likeness of
[1:49:00] men
[1:49:01] you see how you can take it too far
[1:49:05] and what did they do
[1:49:07] the Bible says they rent their clothes
[1:49:10] and they did everything they could to
[1:49:13] try to convince them because the Bible
[1:49:15] says they wanted to make sacrifice Doom
[1:49:19] and they said Paul he must be Jupiter
[1:49:21] because he's the spokesman
[1:49:23] do you see how quickly because man was
[1:49:27] made to be God
[1:49:30] so people are going oh wow he must be
[1:49:34] your God
[1:49:35] how quickly do people make others gods
[1:49:40] just because they can shoot a basketball
[1:49:43] they can sing a song they can play an
[1:49:46] instrument
[1:49:47] they can do something and so people want
[1:49:49] to make them Gods because that is the
[1:49:52] purpose
[1:49:59] but we have two kinds of Gods
[1:50:06] follow along now here
[1:50:11] brother Branham said now and stand still
[1:50:13] see the salvation of the Lord
[1:50:16] now in the face of this great shaking
[1:50:19] hour
[1:50:20] that when the devil if he can't keep you
[1:50:22] from seeing the truth
[1:50:24] he will push you overboard with it
[1:50:27] the church is shook again
[1:50:29] in a sermon on certain sound Charles
[1:50:32] Fuller
[1:50:33] how many ever heard that old-fashioned
[1:50:35] Revival hour great man he said not long
[1:50:38] ago he said we have the speaking and
[1:50:40] tongues and interpretations right here
[1:50:43] right there in Long Beach and that's
[1:50:45] true I preached right there with him
[1:50:47] many times so they have the
[1:50:49] interpretation and May and make
[1:50:51] everybody sit quiet
[1:50:53] think of it is
[1:50:55] we don't reverence those gifts
[1:50:58] sometimes if a gift gets out of our
[1:51:01] listener here's a prophet
[1:51:02] if a gift gets out of order
[1:51:05] you have to call it down
[1:51:08] well ain't nobody like to be called down
[1:51:16] remember that sister
[1:51:21] he said he said quiet he said kind of
[1:51:23] reverently first sit down
[1:51:27] he kept going
[1:51:28] started speaking in tongue sit down
[1:51:35] sit down
[1:51:38] finally everybody shut up and she shut
[1:51:40] up
[1:51:42] she gonna meet him right after service
[1:51:44] gonna tell you guess what
[1:51:47] huh
[1:51:50] ah she had a real word of the Lord
[1:51:53] you he said no no he's spirits of the
[1:51:55] prophets are subject to the prophet
[1:51:58] you see how people have not been taught
[1:52:01] correctly even with the gifts in the
[1:52:04] church the prophet of God said okay
[1:52:05] Brandon Tabernacle I've let you play
[1:52:07] with these gifts all these years now
[1:52:09] it's time to put it in order hold the
[1:52:11] people accountable
[1:52:15] tongues and interpretation brother Brown
[1:52:17] said tongues and interpretation is
[1:52:19] prophecy
[1:52:20] he said now it's not reiterating
[1:52:22] scripture and I read it quote even late
[1:52:25] last night brother Brown said oh I've
[1:52:27] heard them speak in tongues for five
[1:52:29] minutes and then give a four sentence
[1:52:33] interpretation
[1:52:35] he said why watch he said if one has a
[1:52:39] certain inflection of voice and they
[1:52:41] speak so many times
[1:52:44] he said so does the interpretation
[1:52:48] huh and he said interpretation is not
[1:52:51] well wishing it's not reiteration of
[1:52:53] scriptures it's not those kind of things
[1:52:55] because Pentecost was full of that
[1:52:59] oh
[1:53:02] oh God is saying to you if you will
[1:53:06] humble yourself and pray will you not
[1:53:10] hear from God oh if you will just uh you
[1:53:13] know get away from your Idols of this
[1:53:16] world oh if you will just do this I will
[1:53:19] pour out my spirit upon you you will
[1:53:22] have blessings that you cannot contain
[1:53:24] everybody oh
[1:53:28] brother Graham said that's his well
[1:53:29] wishing he said that's repeating
[1:53:31] scripture because I can show you the
[1:53:33] scripture said if you seek God God will
[1:53:35] seek after you if huh if you make a move
[1:53:37] for God God Will Make a Move for you is
[1:53:39] his arm too sure come on now
[1:53:42] they're not just some hypothetical thing
[1:53:44] he said prophecy it'll foretell a future
[1:53:47] event don't go home by way of I-17
[1:53:50] because there's going to be an accident
[1:53:53] and he said then let
[1:53:55] he said let the one who spoke in tongues
[1:53:58] and the one who interpreted it and then
[1:54:01] three judges three is a witness that
[1:54:03] right
[1:54:04] he said we got a room in the back he
[1:54:06] said we'll get him in the back room and
[1:54:07] then they can they can use their gift
[1:54:09] all they want they can prophesy and here
[1:54:11] it is write it down
[1:54:13] and he said if it don't come to pass
[1:54:18] he said you've got lion Spirit among you
[1:54:21] and he says and the one who spoke in
[1:54:23] tongues
[1:54:24] the one who translated
[1:54:27] and the three Witnesses stepped down
[1:54:31] wow
[1:54:34] where do you see that in our message
[1:54:36] churches
[1:54:40] why did Junior Jackson and Dawn rutle
[1:54:43] leave brother branham's Church they were
[1:54:45] sister churches
[1:54:48] because when he put the church in order
[1:54:51] they said brother Brown you know what
[1:54:53] he's Church ordered himself right out of
[1:54:56] the Holy Ghost
[1:54:58] and brother Ram said now you just leave
[1:55:00] Junior Jackson them alone if Junior
[1:55:01] Jackson here's a quote wants to have
[1:55:04] tongues and interpretation in his church
[1:55:06] he said that's his problem
[1:55:09] I like that that's his problem
[1:55:12] you see when people are held accountable
[1:55:16] you see in the Old Testament if a
[1:55:19] prophet got up and he prophesied hear o
[1:55:22] Israel thus and thus and thus and it
[1:55:25] didn't come to pass what did they do
[1:55:31] huh
[1:55:34] there'd be
[1:55:36] anyway you know what I was gonna say
[1:55:42] now
[1:55:43] so if you're not careful if he keeps you
[1:55:46] can't keep you from seeing the truth
[1:55:47] he'll push you overboard with
[1:55:51] okay
[1:55:54] watch Charles Fuller okay and sometimes
[1:55:57] the gift gets out of order
[1:55:59] see Satan trying to push them overboard
[1:56:01] if he can't keep a truth from you he'll
[1:56:03] take that same truth push you overboard
[1:56:05] with us he he'll make a fanaticism out
[1:56:08] of it
[1:56:10] God help us to have right in the middle
[1:56:12] of the road now
[1:56:14] listen saints of God I'm not afraid to
[1:56:17] take and look at the prophet's Ministry
[1:56:20] itself of spirits that we're trying to
[1:56:24] actually take this message and made it
[1:56:27] fanatical
[1:56:30] he says for you to call me Jesus Christ
[1:56:33] makes me Antichrist
[1:56:35] and yet
[1:56:36] we know
[1:56:38] that the word of the Lord comes to the
[1:56:40] prophets and the prophets are
[1:56:43] gods
[1:56:45] do you see
[1:56:47] yes amen but
[1:56:50] to take it too far now watch what
[1:56:52] brother Ram said a lot easier in church
[1:56:53] age
[1:56:54] I want to make one more comparison
[1:56:57] between the loudest and prophet
[1:56:59] the messenger and John
[1:57:02] and the prophet messenger who preached
[1:57:06] Jesus's first coming the people in
[1:57:09] John's day
[1:57:11] mistook him for the Messiah
[1:57:14] he quotes John 1 19-20 now this last day
[1:57:18] Prophet Messenger will have such power
[1:57:21] before the Lord
[1:57:22] that there will be those who must stick
[1:57:24] him mistake him for the Lord Jesus
[1:57:28] there will be a spirit now I I didn't
[1:57:32] put this in parentheses I underline this
[1:57:36] there will be a spirit in the world at
[1:57:38] the end time that will seduce some and
[1:57:41] make them believe this
[1:57:44] wow he's talking about seducing spirits
[1:57:48] brother Branham calls him he said what's
[1:57:50] a seducing Spirit seducing clergy
[1:57:54] spirit
[1:57:56] let me tell you most of the time you'll
[1:57:58] never get false doctrines from the word
[1:58:00] of God nor from the message of the hour
[1:58:04] you only get these things because they
[1:58:07] are man carried
[1:58:09] they are the STDs of the message
[1:58:12] do you know how you get AIDS
[1:58:15] not by somebody talking to you
[1:58:19] because you have personal
[1:58:22] contact with them
[1:58:26] how do you get these fanatical Spirits
[1:58:30] or other spirits to preach another Jesus
[1:58:35] to do all of these things that the
[1:58:37] Apostle Paul talks about preach another
[1:58:40] gospel
[1:58:41] he said where'd you get it you it's
[1:58:44] spiritually transmitted diseases
[1:58:51] mere Association here's another quote
[1:58:53] with kind-hearted people can send you to
[1:58:57] hell
[1:58:59] yeah but they're good people
[1:59:05] mayor Association
[1:59:10] he said now he quotes now Matthew 24.
[1:59:13] let's go to the bottom of this quote
[1:59:15] but don't you believe it
[1:59:17] he is not Jesus Christ he is not
[1:59:22] the Son of God he is one of the Brethren
[1:59:26] a prophet a messenger a servant of God
[1:59:29] he's he needs
[1:59:33] no greater honor bestowed upon him than
[1:59:37] that which John received when he was The
[1:59:39] Voice

[1:59:42] after me
[1:59:46] now
[1:59:47] let me take
[1:59:49] and do a little pit stop here for just a
[1:59:51] minute
[1:59:52] and ask you do you know any Ministries
[1:59:55] within the message
[1:59:58] that have gone so far as to that
[2:00:00] Minister has become a god minister
[2:00:05] that they worship Him
[2:00:07] they baptized in his name
[2:00:09] some of the largest churches and I'm not
[2:00:12] going to name names
[2:00:15] but it don't take long and you can
[2:00:16] search around some of the largest
[2:00:18] churches in this message
[2:00:20] those churches baptize
[2:00:23] and their pastor's name and they sing
[2:00:26] songs and they worship their Pastor as
[2:00:30] he is a God
[2:00:34] do you see if he can't get you one way
[2:00:37] he'll get you another now listen saints

[2:01:16] and he says hey I have found a man who
[2:01:19] is a prophet
[2:01:20] and I want you to meet him

[2:03:11] you see if you haven't been around
[2:03:14] somebody who's got a gift you'll be
[2:03:16] immediately be influenced you young
[2:03:19] people
[2:03:20] have you ever been around tongues and
[2:03:22] interpretation in tongues
[2:03:26] you ever been around when people are
[2:03:28] slain in the spirit
[2:03:33] have you ever seen people
[2:03:35] what is called a Pentecostal blessing
[2:03:38] with people shaking violently
[2:03:42] and lose control
[2:03:45] listen one thing that I see that I love
[2:03:49] about this message
[2:03:52] was when I came to it it was so real and
[2:03:54] so genuine there wasn't none of this
[2:03:56] phony stuff of all of this stuff and
[2:03:59] uncontrollable shaking and people
[2:04:00] falling down and all of this kind of
[2:04:02] stuff
[2:04:04] it was real it was genuine
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:08] huh
[2:04:09] and yet today
[2:04:12] people allow anointings
[2:04:16] anointings is it the Holy Spirit yes it
[2:04:19] is
[2:04:21] and his Reign falls upon what the just
[2:04:24] and the unjust the of bird the same
[2:04:27] as the wheat so you don't judge it by
[2:04:30] the anointing it's a real Holy Ghost
[2:04:32] anointing even on wrong seed
[2:04:37] let me ask you a question
[2:04:40] if the Holy Spirit fell on one of you
[2:04:42] sisters
[2:04:44] and you fell on the floor
[2:04:47] would it make you act Unholy
[2:04:51] the Holy Ghost does not act Unholy
[2:04:59] I'm asking you you judge by the word
[2:05:03] and the word itself
[2:05:06] I had a brother one time tell me that I
[2:05:08] blasphemed the Holy Ghost
[2:05:11] I said I can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[2:05:14] I said because I get the Holy Ghost
[2:05:16] inside of me I said now I'm disagreeing
[2:05:18] with your opinion but I said you can't
[2:05:21] tell me a blasphemy the Holy Ghost
[2:05:23] I told him this is what happened I told
[2:05:25] him I said the only thing that fell on
[2:05:27] the DIA Pentecost was the Holy Spirit
[2:05:31] does it say The Believers all fail
[2:05:35] said they began to speak in tongues
[2:05:37] okay in fact
[2:05:40] it's amazing
[2:05:42] brother Paul loveball sent me a quote
[2:05:44] here
[2:05:45] this morning or yesterday he said I am
[2:05:48] so sick and tired of hearing nothing but
[2:05:50] Acts 2 4 Acts 2 4 Acts 2 4.
[2:05:54] speaking in tongues as the spirit gave
[2:05:57] him utterance
[2:05:58] he said why don't we go beyond
[2:06:01] huh I got a pair of shoes and then
[2:06:04] tongues came with it
[2:06:09] seeds of God tongues is the least of the
[2:06:12] gifts
[2:06:13] is that right he said you stay under the
[2:06:15] presence of God long enough you will
[2:06:17] speak in tongues praise God Paul said I
[2:06:20] I speak in tongues more than you all but
[2:06:23] I would rather speak five words in a
[2:06:25] language you know because it edifies
[2:06:27] your soul than ten thousand words and an
[2:06:29] unknown tongue
[2:06:32] in fact brother Reno look it up
[2:06:36] look it up he says so this glossary
[2:06:38] right now of speaking in tongues and the
[2:06:41] outpouring of the spirit it appears to
[2:06:43] be that long-awaited restoration he says
[2:06:46] the sign of tongues now coming on is a
[2:06:50] sign type it in impending disaster
[2:06:57] hmm
[2:07:00] come on now we're not little babies
[2:07:05] we are full-grown adults now we've come
[2:07:07] through all of that stuff the prophet of
[2:07:09] God said let's put it in order let's do
[2:07:11] these things and he says now let us go
[2:07:14] on unto Perfection not laying again the
[2:07:17] foundation of good works the laying on
[2:07:19] of hands Healing The Sick all of that
[2:07:21] right he said let us go on
[2:07:23] somebody say let's go
[2:07:25] yeah amen

[2:10:36] excited
[2:10:38] you don't want to see me get excited
[2:10:41] amen now watch
[2:10:46] let me set the the record straight this
[2:10:48] morning
[2:10:49] it's not the ministry of some man
[2:10:53] that is perfecting the bride
[2:10:56] it is not a Ministry of some church
[2:11:00] nor is it the ministry
[2:11:03] of the pastor
[2:11:08] now let me say to you
[2:11:12] it is the Holy Spirit
[2:11:15] let me give you a quote
[2:11:18] brother Branham says in the sermon
[2:11:19] Investments
[2:11:22] now I'm going to read the highlighted
[2:11:25] portions because to save time
[2:11:28] look the word of the Lord comes through
[2:11:29] the prophet John was the prophet of the
[2:11:32] hour
[2:11:33] he was standing in the water declaring
[2:11:36] that the Messiah was already among them
[2:11:38] somewhere
[2:11:40] he would know it by a sign and when the
[2:11:43] Messiah being the word he came into the
[2:11:46] water to the prophet the word coming to
[2:11:49] the prophet
[2:11:51] so now we think you are God's why
[2:11:53] because to whom the word of the Lord
[2:11:56] comes to
[2:11:58] are you putting two and two together
[2:11:59] here all right and Jesus said in these
[2:12:02] days
[2:12:03] he which is a personal pronoun he the
[2:12:06] Holy Ghost when he has come upon you
[2:12:08] come to you he will show you these
[2:12:11] things I've taught you and show you
[2:12:13] things to come remember excuse me
[2:12:15] Remains the same thing the Holy Spirit
[2:12:18] is the prophet among us today the Holy
[2:12:22] Spirit
[2:12:24] is the prophet
[2:12:28] can you say Amen to that
[2:12:31] no I'm not taking anything away from
[2:12:33] Brother Branham
[2:12:34] he was the vessel
[2:12:37] but the voice
[2:12:40] the spirit of God coming to him
[2:12:46] watch this anointed one's the end time
[2:12:49] the Bible said in the mouth that two or
[2:12:50] three Witnesses Larry word be
[2:12:52] established
[2:12:53] I spoke of Balaam
[2:12:56] and of Moses
[2:12:57] I spoke of Micaiah and zedekiah now I'm
[2:13:01] going to give you one more which there's
[2:13:04] hundreds of them but one more to make
[2:13:06] them three Witnesses I got a whole
[2:13:08] string of wrote down here but to
[2:13:11] preserve time and he talks about
[2:13:12] Jeremiah but now every Prophet true
[2:13:15] Prophet that ever raised in the world
[2:13:18] cursed those denomination organizations
[2:13:21] of the church how could it change by the
[2:13:24] unchanging God the holy spirit is the
[2:13:28] prophet of this hour
[2:13:33] no I thought William Branham was
[2:13:38] understand he's the vessel God used
[2:13:43] that's why some will say well we need to
[2:13:45] put the prophet back in the pulpit
[2:13:49] saying to God he never left
[2:13:52] he changed his mouth
[2:13:55] God in Martha
[2:13:57] but the reason that we fail to catch god
[2:14:00] brother Ram said it's the veil it's
[2:14:02] because of our human Veil we we fail to
[2:14:05] catch what God is doing
[2:14:07] amen
[2:14:11] the holy spirit's the prophet of this
[2:14:13] hour
[2:14:15] he's vindicating his word proving and
[2:14:17] the Holy Spirit was the prophet of Moses
[2:14:19] hour well I thought Moses was a prophet
[2:14:22] no the holy spirit in Moses
[2:14:25] the Holy Spirit was the prophet in
[2:14:27] micaiah's hour
[2:14:29] the Holy Spirit which wrote the word
[2:14:31] comes and confirms the word
[2:14:37] just as it was the Holy Spirit anointing
[2:14:39] men throughout the Bible and it became
[2:14:41] the word of God what was it God in
[2:14:44] Martha
[2:14:46] was it not the Holy Spirit and the
[2:14:48] Prophet this hour doing the same thing
[2:14:52] is it so hard for us to discern it
[2:14:56] brother random are you the son of man
[2:14:58] he said have I been with you so long
[2:15:02] that you don't get it right I'm a son of
[2:15:04] man
[2:15:06] revealing to you
[2:15:08] the son of man don't look at me
[2:15:12] he said I'm just the voice
[2:15:15] remember the sermon the voice of the
[2:15:17] sign he said don't look at the sign look
[2:15:18] at the voice behind this eye
[2:15:21] amen watch this now the uncertain sound
[2:15:24] trying to bring this to a close
[2:15:28] the Gentile nation was issued in with
[2:15:31] King Nebuchadnezzar with unknown tongues
[2:15:34] and interpretation and goes out the same
[2:15:37] way
[2:15:38] as it was
[2:15:40] so shall it be
[2:15:42] amen now he's he's showing you a pattern
[2:15:44] follow the pattern
[2:15:47] issued in by worship
[2:15:50] of the image of a man
[2:15:52] a holy man Daniel
[2:15:56] which was built to shazar the image of
[2:15:59] Daniel to make everybody worship that
[2:16:01] image of a holy man and go out the same
[2:16:04] way brother Brown said look as the
[2:16:07] Gentile Kingdom
[2:16:09] came in this way tongues interpretation
[2:16:12] image of a holy man and worship that
[2:16:15] image
[2:16:17] the three Hebrew children what image did
[2:16:20] they feel
[2:16:21] two bow down to which sent him to the
[2:16:24] fiery furnace
[2:16:26] was Daniel
[2:16:31] oh God still got a few Hebrew children
[2:16:33] around
[2:16:35] fact seven thousand
[2:16:37] that have not
[2:16:39] bowed their need of Baal
[2:16:41] amen you can explain it to people and
[2:16:43] show it to people and they don't know
[2:16:45] which way to go Daniel refused to bow
[2:16:47] down to his own image
[2:16:49] no true Messenger of God will ever allow
[2:16:52] you to worship them
[2:16:55] I tell you what the day some of you
[2:16:58] start baptizing in my name
[2:17:01] huh
[2:17:02] I'm going to retire
[2:17:05] I'm gonna quit I'm gonna say
[2:17:08] what's wrong with you
[2:17:11] huh
[2:17:13] yeah
[2:17:15] now my neighbor said this this is very
[2:17:17] interesting and I I don't mean to Rabbit
[2:17:19] Trail on this but it's very important my
[2:17:21] neighbor came to me
[2:17:23] yesterday I haven't seen him in several
[2:17:25] months at my cabin next his cabin up

[2:17:48] the hospice but she won't do it and
[2:17:50] everybody's against her and all that you
[2:17:52] know all of this stuff and he said so
[2:17:55] I realized that um when you get to the
[2:17:59] place that the person you're trying to
[2:18:01] talk to is not cognizant or understands
[2:18:05] what they're going through he said I

[2:18:14] he says so I wrote myself a letter
[2:18:17] and gave it to all three of my children
[2:18:20] he said the letter is actually to myself
[2:18:23] and if I realize you're reading that
[2:18:25] letter
[2:18:27] I have come to the place
[2:18:32] that I need to

[2:19:52] Revelation chapter 22 verses 8 through
[2:19:54] 9. tonight John saw these things and
[2:19:56] heard them and I heard and seen and I
[2:19:59] fell down to worship before the feet of
[2:20:01] the Angel which showed me these things
[2:20:03] this is an angel man he showed me things
[2:20:06] and saw I fell down
[2:20:10] at his feet and see thou do it not
[2:20:13] for am I of thy fellow servant and of
[2:20:17] thy Brethren the prophets
[2:20:19] and of them which keep the sayings of
[2:20:22] this book
[2:20:24] worship God
[2:20:27] Hallelujah there's a true servant of God
[2:20:30] and brother Brennan would never allow us
[2:20:32] to take our eyes off of Jesus Christ and
[2:20:36] when he starts when you started looking
[2:20:39] at him he said I got nothing to do with
[2:20:41] it
[2:20:44] amen
[2:20:46] musicians go ahead and come
[2:20:54] they can still come
[2:20:56] I'm just not quitting
[2:20:59] now brother Branham anointed ones at the
[2:21:01] end time watch this
[2:21:03] you might have thought today I was
[2:21:05] trying to say that about myself
[2:21:07] being that I was packing this message
[2:21:11] I have no more to do with it than
[2:21:12] nothing no more than just a voice
[2:21:15] my voice against my own better judgment
[2:21:17] I wanted to be a Trapper
[2:21:20] but it's the will of my father that I
[2:21:22] declare to do
[2:21:24] and determined to do
[2:21:26] I wasn't the one that appeared down on
[2:21:28] the river
[2:21:29] I was only standing there when he
[2:21:31] appeared
[2:21:33] I'm not the one who performs these
[2:21:34] sayings and foretells these things
[2:21:36] happens
[2:21:38] as perfect as they are I'm only one near
[2:21:41] when he doesn't
[2:21:43] I was only a voice that he used to say
[2:21:45] it
[2:21:46] it wasn't what I knew
[2:21:49] it's just what I surrendered myself to
[2:21:53] that he spoke through it isn't me it
[2:21:55] wasn't the seventh angel oh no
[2:21:59] he was the manifestation
[2:22:02] of the son of man
[2:22:05] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[2:22:07] the mystery of God unfolded
[2:22:10] it's not a man
[2:22:12] it's God
[2:22:14] the angel was not the son of man
[2:22:17] he was the messenger from the Son of Man
[2:22:21] the son of man is Christ and he's the
[2:22:23] one that you're feeding on
[2:22:25] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[2:22:27] words will fail you're feeding on the
[2:22:30] unfaily body word
[2:22:33] of the son of man
[2:22:36] keep your eyes focused on Christ
[2:22:42] when you make the prophet God himself
[2:22:45] you make him Antichrist
[2:22:48] and yet God was in him
[2:22:58] finally quote there possessing the Gate
[2:23:01] of the enemy 1964.
[2:23:03] skip just a little bit here because I
[2:23:05] want to get to just something
[2:23:07] directly ahead give me another five ten
[2:23:10] minutes
[2:23:11] possessing the Gated enemy let's check
[2:23:13] some of them now Abraham's seed let's
[2:23:17] take the Hebrew children
[2:23:19] because they stood true and wouldn't
[2:23:20] tolerate that image worship
[2:23:23] they refused to bow down to an image
[2:23:26] that the kingdom of the nation had made
[2:23:28] it was a made effort a holy man to the
[2:23:31] image of Daniel
[2:23:33] showed that the Gentile race
[2:23:36] is under the false side of worshiping an
[2:23:40] image of a holy man
[2:23:42] it goes out the same way when people
[2:23:44] will be forced to worship images
[2:23:47] of people
[2:23:49] it came in by revelation of Daniel being
[2:23:52] able to interpret the word and was wrote
[2:23:54] in the handwriting on the wall
[2:23:55] that's the way it come in that's the way
[2:23:57] it goes out same way image of the
[2:23:59] Gentile they refuse to do it and what
[2:24:02] they do they were Abraham's seeds
[2:24:03] standing true to the word and they
[2:24:05] possessed the Gate of the enemy of Fire
[2:24:08] the bride is now beginning to discern
[2:24:10] the Antichrist Spirit not only in the
[2:24:12] world but also in the message
[2:24:18] now let me
[2:24:20] show you something else too because
[2:24:22] we're coming into a manifestation of the
[2:24:24] sons of God is that right
[2:24:26] but now there's two manifestations
[2:24:28] sons of God Sons of the devil serpent
[2:24:31] seat
[2:24:33] and God seed so let me show you it
[2:24:36] happened in job State Job chapter 1
[2:24:38] verses 6 and 7. and there was a day when
[2:24:40] the sons of God came to present
[2:24:42] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[2:24:45] came also among them
[2:24:49] sons of God began to manifest present
[2:24:52] themselves and guess what Satan was
[2:24:53] right there remember the parable of the
[2:24:56] sower of Sydney and he said and God so
[2:24:59] see it in his field and while men slip
[2:25:03] he said the enemy came in and sowed his
[2:25:06] tears
[2:25:07] and a little bit later when the seeds
[2:25:09] sprung up sin came up the tears and the
[2:25:12] wheat and the angel said shall we go
[2:25:15] tear up the tears shall we go no he said
[2:25:18] leave them go until the end time who
[2:25:22] sowed it he said an enemy has done this
[2:25:28] here we are right in the Fulfillment of
[2:25:31] the sowing of tears and wheat same field
[2:25:33] same time same coming to manifestation
[2:25:37] okay
[2:25:41] the two vines coming together it happens
[2:25:45] again in job two verses 1 and 2. and
[2:25:48] again there was a day when the sons of
[2:25:49] God came to present themselves before
[2:25:51] the Lord and Satan came also among them
[2:25:54] to present himself before the Lord so we
[2:25:57] have two manifestations sons of God and
[2:25:59] Sons of the serpent
[2:26:01] they're manifesting themselves and let
[2:26:03] me tell you they're playing their part
[2:26:05] real well
[2:26:06] they're getting so far out they don't
[2:26:08] know their identity
[2:26:10] huh you talk about a Sodom spirit
[2:26:13] Sodom and Gomorrah has infiltrated the
[2:26:16] people of the world until they have lost
[2:26:19] their minds
[2:26:22] the Bible says there to present
[2:26:24] themselves it has two applications
[2:26:27] one is to present yourself is to give an
[2:26:30] account as to Obedience of the word
[2:26:35] number two is to receive further
[2:26:37] instruction and insight for the future
[2:26:41] not only obedience but for future things
[2:26:46] amen
[2:26:50] the Bible says in second Corinthians 4 3
[2:26:52] 3 and 4 if our gospel be hit
[2:26:57] to them that are lost
[2:27:00] in whom the God of this world
[2:27:03] we're talking about gods
[2:27:06] ye are Gods they're hearing the same
[2:27:08] thing
[2:27:11] huh
[2:27:13] basketball players football players
[2:27:16] musicians rock and roll players movie
[2:27:19] stars
[2:27:21] you're gods
[2:27:23] and people will walk around with their
[2:27:26] image on them
[2:27:27] with their name on their back
[2:27:30] they go to the games and what do you
[2:27:32] think they do when they get under that
[2:27:34] anointing they're worshiping the god
[2:27:40] What About Us
[2:27:44] it seems to God you should never be
[2:27:45] embarrassed to go ahead once in a while
[2:27:47] get a little loud and amen and huh yeah
[2:27:53] and don't do it because somebody else is
[2:27:55] doing it
[2:27:57] listen I will do the same thing whether
[2:27:59] I'm sitting up here and hearing another
[2:28:00] preacher preach
[2:28:05] amen
[2:28:06] amen once in a while yes sir
[2:28:10] um
[2:28:12] yes sir
[2:28:14] there'll be times when
[2:28:16] you know what and I like some of you
[2:28:18] that you ain't afraid to stand up I
[2:28:20] don't care if nobody else is standing
[2:28:22] huh because if you feel like standing
[2:28:25] you stand up
[2:28:27] amen somebody
[2:28:30] around you might get a little anointed
[2:28:32] too
[2:28:34] like a colored lady and deep call it the
[2:28:36] Deep
[2:28:37] whoo
[2:28:41] God bless you Colored Lady
[2:28:43] thank you
[2:28:44] he goes on to preach a little bit more
[2:28:50] the camera how many of you seen the film
[2:28:53] she's standing up
[2:28:57] God bless you Colored Lady
[2:29:00] he said that Pillar of Fire is just
[2:29:02] above you right now
[2:29:07] I wonder how many times
[2:29:11] that God comes through this congregation
[2:29:14] and he hovers over one of you and you
[2:29:17] feel his presence and it becomes so so
[2:29:21] real
[2:29:22] that what you do you just there's
[2:29:24] something inside of you that's just you
[2:29:27] can't hardly contain it
[2:29:30] I'm saying why don't you break the sound
[2:29:32] barrier once in a while
[2:29:37] I don't want us to become so Church
[2:29:39] ordered that you're afraid of a real
[2:29:42] move of God
[2:29:44] huh
[2:29:46] we don't need these instruments here
[2:29:49] to get you guys all worked up
[2:29:51] I will show you that 99 of the time
[2:29:54] whenever you have a move in a church or
[2:29:57] something like that it's not because the
[2:30:00] preacher because you know what while
[2:30:02] he's preaching he's conditioning the
[2:30:04] people
[2:30:06] I'll tell you what Hallelujah
[2:30:10] when the holy spirit moves I ain't
[2:30:12] ashamed of it glory to God hallelujah
[2:30:16] and the next thing you know and people
[2:30:18] yeah let's get up here somebody get a
[2:30:20] song come on and you know if the spirit
[2:30:23] of the Lord moves in my heart I will
[2:30:25] dance like David dance the next thing
[2:30:27] you know everybody the next thing you
[2:30:29] know you got everybody now they're
[2:30:30] getting into the spirit
[2:30:32] watch it
[2:30:35] they're getting one another spirit
[2:30:40] Saints have gone
[2:30:42] I remember
[2:30:43] now Sandy I just had Andreas ring and
[2:30:47] call me just before service in my office
[2:30:55] his father died
[2:30:58] a couple weeks ago and I didn't know it
[2:30:59] remember I tell you about that youth
[2:31:01] group over in Germany
[2:31:04] and how the greatest outpouring of the
[2:31:06] Holy Spirit I'd ever seen in my own
[2:31:07] personal life Amos you were there
[2:31:12] I had a vision that morning
[2:31:13] [Music]
[2:31:15] I usually don't tell a lot of this stuff
[2:31:18] I had a vision I I saw in this vision
[2:31:22] I saw myself preaching
[2:31:25] now it's in a farmhouse
[2:31:28] The Farmhouse has got so many kids that
[2:31:31] the the kids are as close to me as what
[2:31:34] you guys are right here
[2:31:35] foreign I've got my translator right
[2:31:38] here
[2:31:39] the presence of God is moving
[2:31:43] and
[2:31:45] all of a sudden everything that I saw in
[2:31:48] my vision
[2:31:50] I step into it
[2:31:54] you know what
[2:31:56] the three or four girls that were
[2:31:58] sitting right here
[2:32:00] I saw them in the vision
[2:32:03] I said I said Lord I'm in the vision
[2:32:06] I'm in the vision and in the vision
[2:32:11] I told a man I pointed him out
[2:32:16] I said young man stand up and say you
[2:32:18] love the Lord
[2:32:21] these three girls turned around Jonathan
[2:32:24] to see who I'm pointing to
[2:32:26] guess what he's the worst kid in the
[2:32:28] group
[2:32:33] he is the worst sinner among all of them
[2:32:35] and these girls guess what they did
[2:32:39] they turned around to look to see who I
[2:32:41] said stand up and say you love the Lord
[2:32:45] ever miss it preacher
[2:32:47] you say you got a gifted discernment
[2:32:52] this man raised his hand
[2:32:56] he said you know yesterday when brother
[2:32:58] Ron was preaching
[2:33:01] he said I want something real I don't
[2:33:03] want something
[2:33:04] I don't want just an emotion I need to
[2:33:07] know it's real
[2:33:11] he said
[2:33:12] this was his father's place
[2:33:15] his father just died a few weeks ago I
[2:33:17] didn't know it
[2:33:20] he said I stayed in the hay loft above
[2:33:23] where you throw the hay down to the cows
[2:33:24] and everything
[2:33:25] this is a farmhouse he said I stayed up
[2:33:28] in the Loft and I cried out to God all
[2:33:30] night oh God oh God
[2:33:33] if you're real
[2:33:35] if you are truly real
[2:33:38] I need a sign I need you to do something
[2:33:40] Lord I Need to Know
[2:33:43] he said you have brother Ron call me out
[2:33:47] have him call me out and stand up and
[2:33:50] say I love the Lord
[2:33:53] how do you think he felt when I said
[2:33:55] young man stand up and say you love the
[2:33:57] Lord
[2:34:00] he began to talk about
[2:34:02] how that God and the next thing you know
[2:34:05] saying to God you know what
[2:34:07] and I said don't nobody move
[2:34:11] the organ and the piano God don't need
[2:34:14] your help if he's here
[2:34:18] I said just worship Him
[2:34:21] you don't have to work it up
[2:34:23] and one by one they all began to get
[2:34:26] into the Spirit of worship and next
[2:34:28] thing you know I saw a move of God it
[2:34:31] wasn't something I orchestrated come on
[2:34:33] yeah when we all get to heaven
[2:34:37] what it was a song
[2:34:41] besides your help on the day of
[2:34:42] Pentecost they were sitting just like
[2:34:45] you're doing they were sitting
[2:34:48] and they all got into one mind and one
[2:34:50] Accord and if you all will start to get
[2:34:52] into one mind in one Accord and you will
[2:34:55] begin to have faith rise up in there
[2:34:57] guess what and oh there could be a sound
[2:35:00] like a rushing Mighty Wind he didn't
[2:35:02] tell him what to expect he didn't tell
[2:35:04] him what would happen he just said stay
[2:35:07] there until you were a dude with power
[2:35:10] from on high
[2:35:13] amen
[2:35:16] laughs
[2:35:23] Lucifer who is the God of this world
[2:35:26] is bringing his gods
[2:35:29] to fruition
[2:35:32] that's who you go to school with
[2:35:36] you go to bank
[2:35:38] you go to the supermarket
[2:35:40] and everywhere you go
[2:35:43] you're surrounded
[2:35:45] by gods
[2:35:47] [Music]
[2:35:49] and they don't look they don't mind
[2:35:51] letting you know who they worship
[2:35:55] when they are in their car
[2:35:58] they turn up the volume
[2:36:03] huh
[2:36:05] have you had any of them pass you lately
[2:36:09] ah
[2:36:13] I'll never forget the time I I got a CJ5
[2:36:17] Jeep
[2:36:18] took the top off
[2:36:21] and I had just bought a nice stereo so I
[2:36:24] could hear the prophet and hear the tape
[2:36:26] of the Prophet while I'm driving the
[2:36:28] jeep 50 miles an hour down the road
[2:36:31] because the wind
[2:36:33] so I could turn it up man it's a good
[2:36:35] stereo speaker system
[2:36:39] so I'd turn it up and I'm driving down
[2:36:40] the road no doors no top
[2:36:43] all this noise
[2:36:45] well I was just coming from church
[2:36:49] and I'm driving through town and I'm
[2:36:51] going stoplight after stoplight
[2:36:54] and so I kind of turn it down a little
[2:36:57] bit
[2:36:58] and you can still hear it anybody
[2:37:00] driving next to you they hear it well I
[2:37:03] remember four girls in a car come next
[2:37:05] to me and they were in a convertible
[2:37:07] and they got their music
[2:37:09] like this
[2:37:11] and everything and the music was louder
[2:37:14] than the voice of the Prophet so I
[2:37:16] turned up the volume of the prophet
[2:37:19] Brethren said you painted face Jezebel
[2:37:25] he said something like that with all
[2:37:27] four of their heads just snap back
[2:37:29] around
[2:37:31] I said yeah he's talking to you
[2:37:36] all saints of God I'm not ashamed of
[2:37:38] this gospel I love it there isn't hardly
[2:37:41] a day that goes by
[2:37:44] this is not lighting a candle this is
[2:37:46] not being religious saints of God this
[2:37:49] is hearing his voice
[2:37:51] because there is one ordained of God to
[2:37:54] turn your hearts back in this age
[2:37:56] listen if there's any message I
[2:37:58] propagate it's a message of Malachi 4.
[2:38:02] it's not me it's not I I'm just a letter
[2:38:04] carrier you can't get mad at me that's
[2:38:07] why why do you think I put the quotes up
[2:38:09] up here
[2:38:10] because I just don't want you to see
[2:38:13] that this is something I want you to see
[2:38:15] it
[2:38:16] and then what's even better I tell you
[2:38:18] you go home and listen to the whole tape

[2:38:40] as soon as you guys pull it up here
[2:38:42] we'll go ahead
[2:38:43] Brethren yeah there it is first seal
[2:38:45] that white horse rider has been in the
[2:38:47] land all the time
[2:38:50] he will change from Antichrist he does
[2:38:53] that and becomes a to a false prophet
[2:38:56] he started an antichrist his Spirit then
[2:38:59] he becomes a false prophet then later
[2:39:01] the devil is cast out he's incarnate
[2:39:04] then with the devil we're talking about
[2:39:06] God in Martha we're talking about Satan
[2:39:09] who is a God in Martha okay
[2:39:13] first stage the devil to begin with
[2:39:15] Spirit of the devil then he becomes
[2:39:21] a false prophet teacher false doctor
[2:39:24] next thing he comes as the very Devil
[2:39:27] Himself incarnate
[2:39:31] same time that this devil falls out of
[2:39:33] heaven and becomes incarnate in a man
[2:39:35] the Holy Spirit goes
[2:39:37] up and comes down incarnate man
[2:39:42] you like you
[2:39:43] two events happening same time
[2:39:46] what is it God in Martha
[2:39:49] a god of the world in morpha in the
[2:39:51] world and the god
[2:39:53] of gods in morphe in his people

[2:40:02] Christ was the Incarnate God
[2:40:05] you had the Incarnate in flesh Emmanuel
[2:40:08] and Judas was the son of perdition as
[2:40:11] Jesus was the son of God incarnate God
[2:40:14] incarnate devil
[2:40:17] I trust that what you've done you've
[2:40:19] listened to me I've kind of jumped
[2:40:21] around here and there
[2:40:23] but I hope you get the idea and the
[2:40:25] understanding God in Martha
[2:40:27] what is it it's Christ in you this is
[2:40:30] the mystery that's been hit down Through
[2:40:32] the Ages what is it it's Christ in you
[2:40:36] and that's why when you heard the
[2:40:38] message
