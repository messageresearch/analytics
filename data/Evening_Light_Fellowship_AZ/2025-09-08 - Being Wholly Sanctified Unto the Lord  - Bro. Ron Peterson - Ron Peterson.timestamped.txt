[28:54] lover
[28:56] of my soul.
[29:02] Yes, he's the sweetest name I know. Oh,
[29:13] no one could say
[29:16] there's no other name but Jesus.
[29:23] Oh, Jesus.
[29:28] When I was lost,
[29:31] he made a way my Jesus.
[29:36] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[29:40] No one could say,
[29:42] &gt;&gt; no one could say. There's no other name.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; No other name but Jesus.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Say the name Jesus.
[29:57] When I was lost,
[30:01] &gt;&gt; be made a way for Jesus.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, you did, Lord.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[30:10] Oh Jesus,
[30:13] Savior.
[30:15] Sweetest. You're the sweetest I know.
[30:20] Oh
[30:22] Jesus, my
[30:26] Lover
[30:28] of my soul
[30:33] Jesus my savior
[30:37] sweetest
[30:38] sweet I know.
[30:42] Oh
[30:44] Jesus,
[30:46] healer,
[30:48] lover
[30:50] of my soul.
[30:55] Yes, he's the sweetest name I know.
[31:00] [Music]
[31:05] I've got peace like a river.
[31:10] Peace like a river.
[31:14] Peace like a river in my soul.
[31:20] I've got joy like a fountain. I've got
[31:25] joy like a fountain. I've got joy like a
[31:31] fountain in my soul.
[31:38] [Music]
[31:44] Amen. That's a beautiful song.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Greg, if you'll come sing.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[32:06] Happy to be in the house of the Lord.
[32:08] This this song's been on my heart for a
[32:10] while. Love this song. I just pray it's
[32:12] a blessing for you. If you would, as you
[32:15] as you pick it up, the chorus is pretty
[32:17] simple. We just want to worship the
[32:18] Lord. Amen.
[32:23] [Music]
[32:48] I know what it's like
[32:55] to be in the presence of the Lord.
[32:59] [Music]
[33:03] And I know what time it is
[33:10] because time stood still
[33:17] and bodies were healed
[33:24] and families restored
[33:32] Because we stay here
[33:38] in the presence of the Lord.
[33:42] [Music]
[33:45] And no one had to say a word.
[33:52] You couldn't even make a sound.
[34:00] And I'd give up everything
[34:07] for this treasure that I found.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I never want it to end.
[34:18] [Music]
[34:21] Oh, so I say stay.
[34:28] Lord, I don't want you to go
[34:31] [Music]
[34:35] cuz my heart is burning
[34:43] in your presence, Lord.
[34:49] Oh, so I'll stay.
[34:57] Where else could I go?
[35:04] Cuz my heart is burning
[35:10] in your presence. Lord,
[35:14] I want more.
[35:18] And I want more.

[36:54] Oh,
[36:56] cuz my heart is burning
[37:03] in your presence.

[38:04] [Music]
[38:08] So, I'll stay.
[38:14] Where else could I go?
[38:21] Cuz my heart is burning
[38:26] [Music]
[38:28] in your presence,
[38:30] Lord.
[38:35] So I'll stay.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[44:14] &gt;&gt; We've been waiting so long.

[44:21] &gt;&gt; have thine way in our hearts, oh God.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Let thy kingdom's will be done
[44:29] &gt;&gt; in this earth as it is in heaven.
[44:33] Father, we long
[44:36] for that great time of
[44:40] reunion
[44:42] &gt;&gt; when you will gather the saints
[44:44] together.
[44:46] Until that time, Father, we will gather
[44:49] together as often as we can here on this
[44:52] earth that we might give you praise and
[44:54] honor and glory and
[44:56] &gt;&gt; we might seek your face and ask you to
[44:58] come down among us, meet every need,
[45:01] answer every prayer, set every captive
[45:04] free. He sent his word and it healed the
[45:08] people. May there be healing virtues go
[45:11] forth. be some father whether they have
[45:14] a sickness or something within their
[45:16] body. I'm asking for the healing virtue
[45:19] of Jesus Christ. The price was paid at
[45:22] Calvary. This is the children's bread. I
[45:26] pray father that you will just come
[45:28] amongst us. Oh God, speak to our hearts
[45:31] as only you can. We love you. We thank
[45:33] you. We praise you. We ask it in Jesus
[45:36] Christ's name.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[45:41] Yes. Come Jesus, come. God bless you
[45:46] this morning. Let's you stand.
[45:49] Remain standing
[45:51] and turn with me in your Bibles, please.
[45:55] Book of Leviticus.
[45:58] Leviticus. Thank you, musicians.
[46:01] Chapter 20:es 7-8. Then we'll go to 1
[46:05] Thessalonians 5. Then we'll go to Acts
[46:09] chapter 26.
[46:12] Amen.
[46:16] Certainly enjoyed those song specials.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; It was so wonderful. I love it.
[46:25] We want to welcome Brother Randy Hail,
[46:28] Sister Mary Joseph to Carrie. Where are
[46:31] they?
[46:32] To to my right. Okay. God bless you.
[46:36] It's good to have you here. God bless
[46:38] you. Amen.
[46:41] Faithful streamers,
[46:43] they don't get a chance to come down
[46:45] here often.
[46:47] And so when they're here, we are
[46:49] thankful to them.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; When they can make it.
[46:54] Brother Mario, Sister Josephine, God
[46:56] bless you. It's good to have you back
[46:59] back home.
[47:01] And uh wasn't it certainly a lovely time
[47:04] Wednesday night? Stephen
[47:06] &gt;&gt; knocked it out of the ballpark.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but that
[47:15] &gt;&gt; that just rung home with me.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[47:19] &gt;&gt; we went home and Sandy and I just kept
[47:21] saying, "I'm thankful for this. I'm
[47:23] thankful for that. Got the right
[47:25] attitude and everything." We laid down
[47:27] in bed, held hands. I had my head on the
[47:30] pillow. I said, "Father, I don't want to
[47:32] ask you for any requests. I just want to
[47:34] thank you for all you've done." I just
[47:36] and I'm praying out loud. I said, "Lord,
[47:39] I thank you for a comfortable bed." My
[47:40] wife says, "Amen."
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, how how
[47:47] &gt;&gt; we should be praising God with the right
[47:50] attitude,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; being thankful in all our hearts for all
[47:54] that he's done. Huh?
[47:56] &gt;&gt; He's a good guy.
[47:58] Amen.
[48:00] A few Sundays ago,
[48:04] we were preaching on warfare at the end
[48:06] time and I had the Holy Spirit quicken
[48:10] something to me which I will branch off
[48:13] from that because we are not ignorant of
[48:16] the devil's devices nor of his tactics
[48:19] and what he does. it realm. It verges on
[48:24] the realm of demonology
[48:27] uh on uh spirits and different things
[48:30] and how they affect our lives.
[48:33] And um so I want to maybe just lay a
[48:37] little bit of a foundation
[48:40] this morning for what I will go off into
[48:43] in the next couple services.
[48:47] And um
[48:49] so I want to be able to take my time. I
[48:52] don't want to hurry. Uh I think when you
[48:55] get a hurry, sometimes what happens is
[48:57] you kind of miss things. I want to be
[48:59] very attentive to the Holy Spirit. I
[49:01] want you to be sensitive.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; To the Holy Spirit. God's going to speak
[49:05] to you. He's going to give you
[49:06] something. He's going to help you. Amen.
[49:09] Wherever two or more are gathered
[49:11] together, there will I be in their
[49:13] midst. That's a promise of God. So he's
[49:15] here, Lord. You've just got to recognize
[49:17] it. You've got to thank him that he's
[49:20] &gt;&gt; he's preparing you right now.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; For things of not only what you've been
[49:28] through, but what you're going to go
[49:29] through.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the same yesterday, today,
[49:34] and forever.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love him this morning with all
[49:37] my heart.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; All right. If you have the book of
[49:40] Leviticus,
[49:42] open chapter 20.
[49:45] Leviticus 20 verses 7-8.
[49:55] Sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye
[49:57] holy,
[50:00] for I am the Lord your God, and ye shall
[50:04] keep my statutes and do them.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord
[50:10] which sanctify you.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:14] Notice sanctify yourselves
[50:18] and I am the Lord which sanctify you.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Turn with me if you would to the book of
[50:24] 1 Thessalonians. 1 Thessalonians chapter
[50:28] 5.
[50:42] Amen.
[50:45] verses 18- 24
[50:52] in everything
[50:55] give thanks.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; For this is the will of God in Christ
[51:00] Jesus concerning you.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Quench not the spirit.
[51:06] Despise not prophesyings.
[51:11] Prove all things,
[51:13] &gt;&gt; hold fast that which is good.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Abstain from all appearance of evil.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you
[51:25] holy. And I pray God, your whole spirit
[51:30] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[51:35] unto the coming of the Lord Jesus
[51:37] Christ.
[51:39] Faithful is he that calleth you.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Who also will do it.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Notice verse 23 again if you
[51:50] would. And the very God of peace
[51:52] sanctify you holy.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; In every part,
[52:00] &gt;&gt; your spirit,
[52:02] your soul
[52:04] and body. Here is the triune being of
[52:06] man. Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And God is saying, I want you to be
[52:10] wholly sanctified
[52:12] &gt;&gt; in all three areas.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to understand
[52:18] &gt;&gt; those three realms.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; The natural realm, the spiritual realm,
[52:26] and the holy of holies.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:29] Acts chapter 26.
[52:39] verses 13- 19 and
[52:42] here it is Paul goes before a grippa
[52:47] and he is to give an account of
[52:50] why he is doing what he is doing and how
[52:53] that there's been such a great change.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Now notice this change. He had been a
[53:00] Pharisee of Pharisees.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; He had been a religious zealot
[53:09] &gt;&gt; concerning the law
[53:11] blameless.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; And yet it took just a moment in the
[53:17] presence.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; It's all it takes.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It just takes a moment in the
[53:26] presence of almighty God
[53:29] &gt;&gt; and lives are changed.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; And so now he's giving an account to
[53:34] King Agria.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; He's brought before counsel.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; And so let's catch this. Verse 13.
[53:47] At midday, O king,
[53:50] I saw in the way a light from heaven
[53:54] about the brightness of the sun shining
[53:58] round about me and them which journeyied
[54:01] with me.
[54:04] And when we were all fallen to the
[54:06] earth,
[54:08] I heard a voice speaking unto me and
[54:10] saying in the Hebrew tongue,
[54:13] Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It
[54:18] is hard for thee to kick against the
[54:21] bricks.
[54:23] And I said, Who art thou, Lord?
[54:29] And he said, I am Jesus whom thou
[54:32] persecutes.
[54:44] But rise and stand upon thy feet,
[54:48] for I have appeared unto thee for this
[54:50] purpose,
[54:53] to make thee a minister,
[54:56] and a witness, both of these things
[54:58] which thou has seen, and of those things
[55:01] in which I will appear unto thee.
[55:07] So every appearing of God has a purpose.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Not only of what he has shown you in the
[55:16] past, but what he'll show you in the
[55:17] future.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Verse 18, excuse me, 17. Delivering thee
[55:24] from the people,
[55:27] and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I
[55:30] send thee.
[55:32] He delivers them from the people and
[55:34] then sends them back to the people
[55:39] &gt;&gt; to open their eyes
[55:42] and to turn them from darkness to light
[55:45] and from the power of Satan
[55:48] &gt;&gt; unto God,
[55:50] that they may receive forgiveness of
[55:52] sins and inheritance
[55:55] among them which are sanctified by faith
[55:59] that is in me.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Whereupon, O king Agrippa,
[56:05] I was not disobedient
[56:08] unto the heavenly
[56:12] &gt;&gt; May God add the blessing of the reading
[56:14] of his word. You may be seated this
[56:17] morning in the presence of God.
[56:24] Amen.
[56:33] I would like to title my sermon
[56:37] this morning, being wholly sanctified
[56:41] unto the Lord.
[56:45] Because that's what the scripture says.
[56:47] the very God of peace sanctify you holy
[56:52] &gt;&gt; in every part of your being
[56:57] that your whole spirit and soul and body
[57:00] might be preserved blameless
[57:04] to the coming of the Lord Jesus.
[57:07] I would like to preach on this subject
[57:10] this morning of being sanctified holy
[57:12] unto the Lord. And I want to talk about
[57:15] and go in this direction of possessing
[57:18] the gates
[57:20] of the enemy.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; And to just remind you, brother Brennham
[57:25] said, "My worst enemy
[57:32] &gt;&gt; is myself.
[57:37] He said, "If I can learn to get myself
[57:39] out of the way, God might have his way
[57:42] in my life."
[57:47] &gt;&gt; So when we talk about so much of the
[57:49] time, Lord, deliver me from
[57:52] this devil and this thing that's
[57:55] bothering me, really,
[57:57] &gt;&gt; you might look in retrospect and say,
[58:00] Lord, deliver me from myself.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Because it's self-inflicted. Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; I've got gates that have got problems
[58:07] and I need you to possess the gates.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Of this enemy.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; There are three scriptural principles
[58:19] being applied here. God sanctified
[58:22] Israel.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; I the Lord God I sanctify you. So there
[58:26] is sanctification that is coming from
[58:29] God and we'll speak about that. And then
[58:32] he says, "Sanctify yourselves."
[58:35] So God does a work of sanctification,
[58:37] but then he expects us to do
[58:40] sanctification ourselves.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; And I ask you, how do we sanctify
[58:45] ourselves?
[58:49] &gt;&gt; And he says, keep my statutes and do
[58:52] them.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; So this first part, I am the Lord who
[58:59] sanctifies you.
[59:01] We see that God sanctified Israel by
[59:05] peculiar privileges,
[59:07] laws, and favors
[59:10] and covenants that distinguished Israel
[59:15] from all other nations.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; It was God that chose them. So God now
[59:21] signifies to these people that they are
[59:24] set apart by God himself.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; God did it.
[59:30] I sanctify you. I am the Lord God. I
[59:33] sanctify you.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; And we see that God's people and are and
[59:40] will be people of distinction.
[59:46] God has set you apart. He has called you
[59:50] by a holy covenant.
[59:56] He wants you to be distinguished or set
[59:59] aside,
[1:00:02] separated unto him
[1:00:04] that you might show in your life holy
[1:00:07] conversation
[1:00:10] and a holy life by the life that you
[1:00:13] live.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; God, help us to live a sermon more than
[1:00:17] preach it.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:00:22] Amen.
[1:00:24] God's sanctifying us is a good reason
[1:00:27] why we should sanctify ourselves.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; For what good are God's covenants to us
[1:00:34] unless we keep his commandments?
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; God takes the first credit by saying it
[1:00:43] is I the Lord God who sanctify you.
[1:00:46] So we understand really this start of
[1:00:49] sanctification is not something of your
[1:00:52] works but it's God's works.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; And yet there's something for us to do.
[1:00:56] God leaves you. Each and every one of
[1:00:59] you
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; man, woman, boy, girl, it doesn't
[1:01:03] matter. Every one of you have got
[1:01:05] something to do
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; as far as sanctifying your life.
[1:01:14] We ask the question, how might I
[1:01:16] sanctify my life?
[1:01:19] When we sanctify ourselves, it is when
[1:01:22] we become obedient to the word and we do
[1:01:24] what the word says. Because in doing
[1:01:26] what the word says, we actually cleanse
[1:01:30] our life. Amen.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; When we accept the blood of Christ and
[1:01:37] thank him for dying for our sins, we are
[1:01:40] then justified before God. But there is
[1:01:43] another step. There must be a time of
[1:01:46] when we've not only accepted the
[1:01:48] sacrifice, but then we give ourselves
[1:01:52] back to God as a whole
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; living sacrifice unto God. Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; We sanctify ourselves.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; When we start walking in newness of life
[1:02:08] and keep the commandments,
[1:02:11] we're actually sanctifying ourselves
[1:02:15] by being obedient to the word. It's not
[1:02:18] the hearing of the word only,
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; but the doers of the word.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. Help us Lord to not only
[1:02:24] hear what the spirit's saying but to do
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; what the spirit is telling us to do.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; In St. John 17 14- 20 I have given them
[1:02:37] thy word and the whole world hated them
[1:02:42] because they are not of the world even
[1:02:45] as I am not of the world. I pray not
[1:02:49] that thou shouldest take them out of the
[1:02:51] world, but thou shouldest keep them from
[1:02:55] evil.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; They are not of the world, even as I am
[1:03:00] not of the world.
[1:03:03] Sanctify them through thy truth.
[1:03:07] Thy word is truth.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; As thou has sent me into the world, even
[1:03:12] so I have also sent them into the world.
[1:03:17] and for their sakes I sanctify myself
[1:03:22] that they also might be sanctified
[1:03:25] through the truth.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Neither I pray
[1:03:30] for these alone, but for them also which
[1:03:32] have believed on me through their word.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; I believe that God is calling every one
[1:03:40] of us now to a higher calling.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; I do. I believe The bride of Christ has
[1:03:48] entered now into her final season.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; I believe that. I believe that we have
[1:03:58] been called now to a higher degree,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; to a higher placing than what you were
[1:04:07] uh a year ago, two years ago,
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; or in the past.
[1:04:13] Right now, God is calling you to a
[1:04:16] higher sanctification.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said the angel came
[1:04:22] to him and said, "As long as you hold on
[1:04:26] to the first and second pull, the third
[1:04:28] can't come."
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "In order for it to come,
[1:04:33] you've got to be more sincere."
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And I think more sincere.
[1:04:40] If that prophet was told by the angel,
[1:04:43] "You've got to be more sincere." I ask
[1:04:46] you and I, "How much more so for you and
[1:04:48] I?"
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; God help us to be more sincere.
[1:04:57] You must be careful that the cares of
[1:04:59] life of this Liosian age and the culture
[1:05:03] in which we live among
[1:05:06] has little effect upon you. Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; It will have an effect. It just depends
[1:05:11] on how well insulated you are
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; from it. Amen.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Because we can isolate ourselves and go
[1:05:19] and do like Jim Jones and go to some
[1:05:23] jungle in Guyana and have a a a little
[1:05:27] campground and a compound where it's
[1:05:30] just us and nobody else and where, you
[1:05:33] know, uh we have all things in common
[1:05:36] and sisters do all the cooking and we
[1:05:40] grow our own food and we live there and
[1:05:42] we don't have mortgages and everything.
[1:05:43] It sounds good, doesn't it?
[1:05:49] And yet, brother Brennham said it won't
[1:05:51] work in our day.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; I mean, so much of the time
[1:05:58] we want to be relieved from all of the
[1:06:01] stress and the encumbrance of the world
[1:06:05] which is upon us. And yet, you got
[1:06:07] yourself into it. Yeah,
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; you might have asked for a job that you
[1:06:14] it's too much
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; can't handle the pressure.
[1:06:20] Then you wonder why you're falling
[1:06:22] apart.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, don't ask God for
[1:06:28] something that you're not willing to
[1:06:29] follow through with.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; We all want greener grass. We all want
[1:06:37] easier lifestyle,
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; but
[1:06:43] um hey, let's face it. We're right here
[1:06:45] in Laa.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And just about the time we
[1:06:51] catch up to the speed of the rats around
[1:06:53] us, the rat race gets faster. Along
[1:06:55] comes a faster rat.
[1:06:58] And the cares of life, if we're not
[1:07:00] careful, choke the feed, the seed, and
[1:07:04] it becomes unfruitful.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:07:11] so I do believe that the bride of Christ
[1:07:14] right now is being called to a higher
[1:07:18] calling.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:22] Just as the voice of God quickened John
[1:07:25] on the aisle of Patmas and said, "Come
[1:07:27] up hither, John." And the Bible says,
[1:07:30] "And immediately I was in the spirit."
[1:07:33] You got to get into the spirit, saints.
[1:07:35] And you don't need to hesitate.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; You got to get in.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; You got to get with it.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; If you're going to seek God, seek him
[1:07:44] now.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Now is the time. This is the day.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Now is the time of salvation. If you're
[1:07:50] going to get serious, get serious now.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; He has quickened you
[1:07:57] by his voice.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; He has sent to you a message
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; that is called of God to prepare a
[1:08:09] people to go to a prepared place. Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Now, in the everpresent
[1:08:17] water of the rock, Brother Brennham says
[1:08:19] this.
[1:08:22] Everything the birds sang different.
[1:08:24] Everybody was sweet. And oh my, how
[1:08:28] everything was just dandy when you first
[1:08:31] got saved. Do you remember that?
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Then come the trying time.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[1:08:41] Nobody told me there'd be trials.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; The chastening, sanctifying time,
[1:08:48] sanctify yourselves from the things of
[1:08:50] the world, laying aside the weights
[1:08:54] that do so easily beset you. You, a man,
[1:08:59] had to stop your smoking, stop your
[1:09:01] drinking, stop going to pool room, your
[1:09:04] allight card parties, all those things.
[1:09:06] You had to sanctify yourself
[1:09:09] from them by the faith of the blood of
[1:09:12] Jesus Christ. Sanctifying yourself. You
[1:09:15] women had to let your hair grow out,
[1:09:18] lengthen your dresses, act like the
[1:09:21] different
[1:09:23] than what you was. Sanctifying time.
[1:09:27] Many times they'd rebel and go back.
[1:09:29] Well, that's not a child of God. I want
[1:09:33] to say this while I'm talking about how
[1:09:37] women let their hair grow and lengthen
[1:09:39] their dresses. I want to say how proud I
[1:09:42] am of those girls that sang that song.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; I looked at them and I said, "God, I am
[1:09:51] so proud." I said, "I believe you could
[1:09:55] say each one of them
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; was exemplary."
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Of modest dress.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:06] clean faces, long hair.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; If I'm proud of them, how about God?
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Here in the midst of Ladia,
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; there is a people.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are a few that have yet to
[1:10:25] bow their knees to the God of fashion
[1:10:28] and that this Baal, this end time god,
[1:10:30] the God of this evil age. There is
[1:10:33] people.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that you're a part of it. I'm
[1:10:37] glad I'm a part of it.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of this gospel.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice this
[1:10:48] that through the process of receiving
[1:10:51] the word of God there is a cleansing
[1:10:53] that is taking place.
[1:10:56] It is a purification.
[1:10:59] It is a purging from sin.
[1:11:02] You are being washed. You are being
[1:11:04] cleansed by the washing of the water by
[1:11:07] the word.
[1:11:09] It's not the preacher that does it. It's
[1:11:12] not the prophet that does it. It's not
[1:11:15] the pastor that does it.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; It's God who does it.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; You're being cleansed
[1:11:24] in your body and in your spirit and in
[1:11:28] your soul.
[1:11:30] There is a cleansing from guilt, from
[1:11:33] sin,
[1:11:34] and by the word of God which has been
[1:11:37] spoken.
[1:11:38] Understand
[1:11:40] this that to receive
[1:11:43] God's word is to receive cleansing.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said
[1:11:54] about the woman at the well,
[1:11:59] even the disciples said if he knew what
[1:12:02] kind of woman this was.
[1:12:07] See, they looked at the outside.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "But Jesus
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; saw cleansing
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; before repentance."
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; My
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Don't judge a book by its cover.
[1:12:34] Don't ever judge a person because of an
[1:12:38] outward appearance.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; For was it not Samuel
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; who told Jesse, "God lookketh not upon
[1:12:48] the
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; outward appearance,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; but he lookth upon the soul."
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Because the soul is where it holds that
[1:12:57] predestinated seat.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:02] So, there's a cleansing taking place.
[1:13:06] My mother's mother, I only met her a
[1:13:10] couple weeks before she died. She lived
[1:13:13] with us while we were here in Phoenix
[1:13:17] across from Turf Paradise Racetrack on
[1:13:20] Bell Road here.
[1:13:23] And she was going to the city of Hope
[1:13:25] for her cancer.
[1:13:29] But my grandmother,
[1:13:32] my mother would say, "Get them boys
[1:13:34] ready for bed."
[1:13:37] 7 8:00 at night and grandma would say,
[1:13:39] "You boys get in here." And she had she
[1:13:42] she used ivory soap.
[1:13:45] If I smell ivory soap to this day, I
[1:13:48] think immediately of grandma,
[1:13:50] my mother's mother,
[1:13:52] and she would just take that sink and
[1:13:55] fill it with water, put that rag down in
[1:13:57] there, and get just soap that thing up,
[1:14:01] and then she would scrub on you.
[1:14:04] And she had one hand on you while she's
[1:14:06] scrubbing with the other cuz you're
[1:14:08] wanting to get get away.
[1:14:12] And I mean to tell you when she got done
[1:14:14] scrubbing you, you were clean.
[1:14:19] You squeaked when you walked back to the
[1:14:21] bedroom.
[1:14:25] I say, "God, give us ministry."
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; They grab a hold of us with one hand and
[1:14:32] the other hand scrub us up.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Take us in the filth of the the
[1:14:37] things and the grime and all of the
[1:14:39] complexes and all of the issues of Ladia
[1:14:43] and scrub us, Lord.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Take us and just wash us clean. Our
[1:14:49] spirits have been defiled. You've rubbed
[1:14:51] shoulders with devils.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; You've had things and and different
[1:14:58] issues that have come up against you all
[1:15:00] week. and you fought against the god of
[1:15:03] this evil age and it's affected you.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; You can't go into a mall without the
[1:15:12] music blaring, a restaurant music
[1:15:15] blaring,
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; signs and things all around and it naked
[1:15:21] women here and all of these things and
[1:15:24] it just affects you.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And what affects you the most? Listen to
[1:15:29] me.
[1:15:31] is that which had an influence on you
[1:15:34] prior to conversion.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; So the music of today when I hear it I
[1:15:41] have it has no effect
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; on me. It's just noise
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; but the music which was a
[1:15:52] the music in my age
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; it has an effect. I hear it and
[1:16:01] unconsciously
[1:16:02] I start humming it.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; I all of a sudden I I'm singing a song
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; and unconsciously
[1:16:16] you're just kind of it it's sucked you
[1:16:19] into it.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; And my wife will say, "What are you
[1:16:26] doing?
[1:16:29] Oh, excuse me. Scooy, Satan, I rebuke
[1:16:33] you.
[1:16:41] Just like the natural man who goes to
[1:16:43] work. And you, some of you that have
[1:16:46] jobs where you work hard, you sweat, you
[1:16:49] get dirty, you get in the trenches, you
[1:16:51] know, you don't work behind a a desk and
[1:16:54] in an air conditioned office, but you
[1:16:57] actually get down and dirty. It's so
[1:17:01] nice to be able to come home
[1:17:04] and get cleaned up and then have have a
[1:17:08] dinner
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; because it refreshes you to get cleaned
[1:17:13] up before you go to bed. Wow, what a
[1:17:16] blessing. How many of you are thankful
[1:17:18] for a shower and a bathtub and a clean
[1:17:21] bed? Huh? And a wife that loves you and
[1:17:24] the nice food that she serves you.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] My wife baked some bread yesterday.
[1:17:33] My the best bread I've ever eaten in my
[1:17:38] life. I We ate a whole loaf.
[1:17:42] I just kept I need another one. No,
[1:17:45] honey. Yes. Yes. Okay, honey. I'm not
[1:17:48] supposed to, but I Yeah, I said I eat a
[1:17:50] whole loaf, man. Just butter that dude
[1:17:52] up.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; That's a reason I'm fat.
[1:17:58] It's the woman thou gave us.
[1:18:03] But they're just
[1:18:08] to be thankful.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That that resonated in my mind
[1:18:15] this whole from Wednesday night
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; all the way through is still resonating.
[1:18:21] Sandy and I, you know, hey, I'm thankful
[1:18:24] that for this and I'm thankful for that.
[1:18:26] I believe saints of God when you are
[1:18:28] thankful or you're grateful. How many of
[1:18:31] you love to give somebody who's grateful
[1:18:33] for the gift you give them?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, if they're not grateful, give
[1:18:40] it back.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Spoiled rotten.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; No, it's always
[1:18:48] But God loves a cheerful giver.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Even if they're not a cheerful receiver
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; anyway.
[1:18:57] So your spiritual man is defiled
[1:19:02] here amongst the laian age in which you
[1:19:05] live. It has an effect.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; The Sodom condition around us is a
[1:19:12] vexation.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Televisions, movies,
[1:19:18] social media and the internet are the
[1:19:21] highest forms of brainwashing and
[1:19:24] influence. in the world today.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; It influences all forms of our society.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; And it affects each one of you.
[1:19:40] Brother Brennham said on basis of
[1:19:41] fellowship back in ' 61. Now there's
[1:19:44] several quotes on this, but brother
[1:19:46] Brennan was talking about a rabbi. He
[1:19:48] was speaking to him
[1:19:51] and he says here not long ago I was
[1:19:52] speaking on this at a fellowship meeting
[1:19:54] and one of the great rabbis in the
[1:19:56] United States met me back behind there
[1:19:58] and I never heard that like that in my
[1:20:02] life been a rabbi and come from a
[1:20:04] generation of rabbi rabbi to rabbi to
[1:20:07] rabbi
[1:20:09] now he's a Pentecostal rabbi with the
[1:20:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost I was
[1:20:14] preaching with him in shreport and the
[1:20:17] lady told him sir
[1:20:19] Uh uh Rabbi, I have a television put in
[1:20:22] your room. He said, "Not television,
[1:20:24] television.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Take them out of there."
[1:20:29] And so, Brother Brennham, now I want you
[1:20:31] to understand television
[1:20:35] is one of the highest forms
[1:20:38] of influence in the world today.
[1:20:45] You see it and you receive it in the
[1:20:49] womb of your mind
[1:20:51] and you take it into your spirit.
[1:20:55] Even brother Brennham uh in his day uh
[1:21:00] he said his wife told him to go buy uh
[1:21:04] her a pair of stockings,
[1:21:06] rayon or chiffon. I can't remember which
[1:21:09] one it was.
[1:21:11] But brother Bram said, uh, "Ah, I can do
[1:21:14] that. I, you know, chiffon, chiffon,
[1:21:16] chiffon, like that." Somebody said,
[1:21:18] "Hey, Bill, how you doing? How's the
[1:21:20] fishing?" Oh, like that. Next thing you
[1:21:22] know, boom, he can't remember what it
[1:21:24] was.
[1:21:26] But remember, now I'm taking you a
[1:21:27] little further than that. And he says,
[1:21:29] "Why? I brought home some dish soap."
[1:21:32] Said, "Honey, you ain't never going to
[1:21:33] have to wash them dishes again because
[1:21:35] all the food's just going to fall right
[1:21:37] off." So just put in there. That's what
[1:21:39] the advertisement says. You don't No
[1:21:41] more scrubbing. Just put it in there and
[1:21:42] it'll fall off. Oh, Bill. You You just
[1:21:47] Do you believe everything that you're
[1:21:49] told?
[1:21:51] How many of you have ever told somebody
[1:21:52] else, "Hey, man, don't believe that."
[1:21:54] Hey. Huh?
[1:21:57] So many times we get sucked in by
[1:21:59] certain things and and this is the uh
[1:22:02] this is the sure cure. This this will
[1:22:04] cure anything from toonial fungus to
[1:22:09] gout to cancer. You just take this and
[1:22:13] drink this thing and you'll get rid of
[1:22:15] constipation. You'll get rid of uh
[1:22:18] bloating. You'll get rid of uh uh all
[1:22:22] the weight you got and it'll drop off
[1:22:24] you overnight.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; And the moment you click on it, I'm
[1:22:31] going to tell you in just a minute. Just
[1:22:33] hold on. Just in one minute. I'm going
[1:22:34] to tell you how you and 40 minutes later
[1:22:37] they still ain't told you.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; And guess what that does? That puts you
[1:22:41] a link to something else. So the next
[1:22:42] time you you get all these
[1:22:44] advertisements,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; how to lose weight, how to this, that I
[1:22:48] tell you what.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:22:54] Now, television used to be censored.
[1:22:59] Videos used to be censored. They used to
[1:23:01] bleep, you know. Well, that guy said
[1:23:04] bleep bleep and he did bleep. If they
[1:23:07] did that today, there'd be no dialogue
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; in the music,
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; in the, you know, in the media
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; because now, uh, horrible, vulgar words
[1:23:23] are said and it doesn't bother anybody
[1:23:26] anymore
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; because the devil wants to desensitize
[1:23:34] you.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You understand? Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, one little word here and there. It
[1:23:38] used to be that the first one that come
[1:23:40] along, oh, I'm not turn the channel, do
[1:23:43] this, turn that thing off. I ain't going
[1:23:45] to listen to that.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Well, what's happened is you become
[1:23:48] desensitized to it. God, help us to keep
[1:23:53] our lives sanctifi. I'm going to I'm
[1:23:55] going to come into the area where we're
[1:23:57] living.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; And talk about some of these things.
[1:24:01] The reason that you're having here in
[1:24:04] America the rise of violence among youth
[1:24:06] is because it's been swn into their
[1:24:08] minds.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; They've seen it on television and
[1:24:13] movies. They have glorified
[1:24:17] killing and using guns and go ahead and
[1:24:20] make my day and all of this stuff that
[1:24:23] is permeated into their minds to where
[1:24:26] young children 8 and 9 years old are
[1:24:30] facing police officers using weapons.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; What did it?
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; There was seed sown into them. the
[1:24:40] violence, the sex, the premarital sex,
[1:24:43] all of this kind of stuff has absolutely
[1:24:46] permeated the minds. They said by the
[1:24:48] time a young person in the world now
[1:24:53] who has watched televisions and all of
[1:24:56] these uncensored programs has not only
[1:24:59] seen adultery
[1:25:02] and killing and murder and that sort of
[1:25:07] thing that by the time they're 16
[1:25:10] they've seen just in murders alone over
[1:25:13] 40,000
[1:25:14] murders. This is what the media they
[1:25:17] make studies
[1:25:20] because America right now is is mega
[1:25:24] dosing. I shouldn't say just America.
[1:25:27] The world has gone pleasure mad.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; They uh the things of pleasure and if it
[1:25:32] feels good do it
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; until they have mega dosed on the things
[1:25:38] of this world until what happens is it
[1:25:42] starts to affect you. Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:25:50] When Israel started losing battles,
[1:25:55] they were given a word, "Thou shalt not
[1:25:57] lose a man. You'll not lose a battle. I,
[1:25:59] the Lord God, will go before you. I will
[1:26:01] fight your battles."
[1:26:04] And Joshua knew that he went to a battle
[1:26:06] one day and he lost some men.
[1:26:10] And when he did, he went before God. And
[1:26:13] God said, "Get up off of your face,
[1:26:15] Joshua.
[1:26:17] There's sin in the camp. The people are
[1:26:19] no longer sanctifying themselves."
[1:26:26] And so, you know the story.
[1:26:32] Remember, God told him, "There'll not be
[1:26:34] any army stand before you.
[1:26:38] Nothing will stop you. There will not be
[1:26:40] any people strong enough.
[1:26:43] There's no giant big enough. But what I
[1:26:46] will go before you.
[1:26:48] I want you to understand now. Let's
[1:26:50] bring it down home. Because as it was
[1:26:52] with them, so will it be with us. If
[1:26:55] you're losing ground,
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; if you're losing battles, if you're
[1:27:00] having harder time now than you have
[1:27:03] before, sanctify yourselves.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to get into this now and
[1:27:09] we're going to show you in Joshua 7 12
[1:27:12] and 13. Therefore, the children of
[1:27:15] Israel could not stand before their
[1:27:17] enemies
[1:27:19] but turn their backs before their
[1:27:20] enemies because they were accursed.
[1:27:24] Neither will I be with you anymore
[1:27:26] except you destroy the cursed thing from
[1:27:29] you among you.
[1:27:32] up. Sanctify the people and say,
[1:27:34] "Sanctify yourselves against the moral."
[1:27:37] In other words, what you've been doing,
[1:27:39] don't do it anymore. We're losing men.
[1:27:41] We're losing ground. Sanctify
[1:27:44] yourselves.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; For thus sayith the Lord God of Israel.
[1:27:50] There's an oursed thing in the midst of
[1:27:51] thee, oh Israel. Thou canst not stand
[1:27:55] before thine enemies till you take away
[1:27:57] the thing from among you.
[1:28:00] Many times it's the little boxes that
[1:28:03] spoil the vine.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; When do you remember when we first came
[1:28:08] to the message?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Why? I tell you, one of the very first
[1:28:12] things we kicked out was the television,
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; the worldly music,
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; the worldly entertainment,
[1:28:21] all of those things. Divorce was unheard
[1:28:25] of among message believers. Amen.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Churches were filled with saints just
[1:28:31] wanting to hear the word. Tell me what
[1:28:33] he said.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; It was very common to travel long
[1:28:39] distances in your car.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Not in an airplane, in your car. Drive
[1:28:47] from Tucson to Arkansas.
[1:28:56] Sister Molly Johnson was just a young
[1:28:58] girl. We got on the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:29:01] bus and we're going back to some
[1:29:04] meetings back in Arkansas
[1:29:07] and they had two old men that were going
[1:29:09] to drive the bus and we're supposed to
[1:29:11] drive all night. It's, you know, takes a
[1:29:13] long time to get there. And so
[1:29:15] everybody's all happy being on this bus
[1:29:18] and so we're riding along and everything
[1:29:20] after about six or eight hours and sun
[1:29:23] starts going down these brother and they
[1:29:25] got so tired said we're going to have to
[1:29:27] quit because we're just we just can't
[1:29:29] keep driving our eyes and everything
[1:29:31] like that. Is there anybody here on this
[1:29:33] bus that has got a you know that can
[1:29:36] drive a dual speed axle? And I kind of
[1:29:40] hunkered down, you know, I drove a
[1:29:42] lumber truck up in in Oregon and
[1:29:46] so finally, okay, I'll do it. So anyway,
[1:29:50] uh I got in there and we we drove the
[1:29:53] bus and we drove all night
[1:29:56] and I I drove from about 10:00 at night
[1:29:59] till the sun came up the next morning. I
[1:30:01] had a great time. I enjoyed it.
[1:30:03] Everybody slept. Nothing worse than have
[1:30:05] a driver when he lugs the engine in a
[1:30:08] higher gear when he ought to downshift,
[1:30:10] go up a hill and you sit in the back of
[1:30:13] the bus and
[1:30:17] downshift, grab a gear lower, right? And
[1:30:20] then you know you Anyway,
[1:30:23] Sister Molly, she's just young girl at
[1:30:26] that time and she sat there and we told
[1:30:29] stories and made them laugh and
[1:30:30] everything. So, Sister Molly goes way
[1:30:32] back and that was a time when Sandy and
[1:30:34] I were we were just engaged.
[1:30:37] Yeah. And I remember going to the
[1:30:39] meetings. I tell you, we went to the
[1:30:42] meetings. So, so anyway, Sandy and I
[1:30:45] were holding hands there as we're going
[1:30:47] into the meeting and one of the deacons
[1:30:48] saw me. He said, "Hey, hey, don't you
[1:30:51] hold her hand." I said, "Uh, well, we're
[1:30:54] engaged. That's my fiance. It don't
[1:30:56] matter."
[1:31:00] Yes, sir.
[1:31:03] Anyway,
[1:31:05] it used to be that we Hey, we we we
[1:31:10] persevered, got in a car, we drove all
[1:31:12] the way, and when we got to the
[1:31:13] meetings, we got there early.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Because we were excited. We wanted to
[1:31:18] hear.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; We were excited to be there.
[1:31:25] People
[1:31:27] fellowshipped around the word of God and
[1:31:29] the message of the hour.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; When we got together, even after the
[1:31:33] meeting, we were talking about what was
[1:31:34] preached.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; We were rejoicing on what we were
[1:31:38] hearing.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; There was no news about uh who's in the
[1:31:42] World Series or the Super Bowl. I could
[1:31:45] care less.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Nobody knew the names of movie stars.
[1:31:54] What was the upand cominging movie?
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; It's time that we sanctify ourselves.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And everything that we do, the word is a
[1:32:05] sharp two-edged sword.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to take this eventually
[1:32:10] and show you the dividing user between
[1:32:13] spirit and soul.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; And we're going to look at that triune
[1:32:18] being of man.
[1:32:20] And we're going to hear some things that
[1:32:22] the prophet of God said
[1:32:25] as an example. He said, "You say,"Well,
[1:32:28] I've got the Holy Ghost. I'm saved." And
[1:32:30] he said, "That don't mean nothing."
[1:32:34] Then he takes it because now what is his
[1:32:36] doctrinal teaching? You got to have the
[1:32:38] Holy Ghost. You got to have the seal of
[1:32:40] God to go in the rapture. Here he says
[1:32:42] that don't mean nothing.
[1:32:44] But now take the teaching because he
[1:32:47] says it depends on the level of your
[1:32:50] anointing
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; because it can be on the body and on the
[1:32:53] spirit and your soul just as black as
[1:32:56] night and the devil's still sitting on
[1:32:58] your throne room. You're justified,
[1:33:00] sanctified, but do not have him on your
[1:33:03] control room.
[1:33:11] in the sermon waters of separation. The
[1:33:13] water of separation separates for you
[1:33:16] from sin.
[1:33:17] I'm gonna go to work.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Robert.
[1:33:24] The water of separation separates you
[1:33:27] from sin. If you are weary, apply the
[1:33:30] water of the word. If you are sick,
[1:33:32] apply the water of the word. For it
[1:33:34] separates you from sickness. Separates
[1:33:37] us from sin. It separates us from weary.
[1:33:39] It separates us from every attribute
[1:33:42] that sin produced. Oh, I love it. For he
[1:33:45] has washed us and cleansed us through
[1:33:47] the washing of the water by the word and
[1:33:50] separated us unto himself.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; You can't stay around the word of God
[1:33:57] very long, but what it starts to wash
[1:33:59] you has an effect on you.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; If the word is not having an effect on
[1:34:03] you, there's something wrong. Either
[1:34:05] it's not the word being preached or
[1:34:07] you're not applying it.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Starts washing you, cleansing you,
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; separates you.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; The fellowship by redemption. Hold on
[1:34:23] now. I'm not just wanting to read
[1:34:24] quotes,
[1:34:27] but this is substantiating this thought
[1:34:30] we're talking about.
[1:34:32] This waters of separation must be kept
[1:34:34] in a clean place.
[1:34:37] Oh, wish we could deal on that a little
[1:34:39] while. A clean place. Waters of
[1:34:42] separation is the word.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Paul said over in Ephesians over here
[1:34:47] said, "For he has washed us with the
[1:34:50] water of the word." See, the waters of
[1:34:53] the separation the word preaching the
[1:34:56] word separates you.
[1:34:59] You hear the word say, "I'm wrong."
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Or are you always right?
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; It's good when you see yourself and say,
[1:35:13] "I failed there.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; I'm wrong."
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Some people never say, "I'm wrong." Some
[1:35:21] people never say, "I'm sorry."
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, you proud
[1:35:28] God, help us humble ourselves.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; And say, "I'm sorry. I'm I'm wrong.
[1:35:34] Forgive me.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; I didn't do right. I'm wrong. I better
[1:35:39] quit this. I'm playing church. I better
[1:35:42] quit that." See, that's the water of
[1:35:45] separation.
[1:35:46] It should be kept in a place. Not a
[1:35:48] cigarette smoking preacher. No, sir. Not
[1:35:51] a preacher that's running around over
[1:35:53] the country, run with other women and
[1:35:55] things like that. Not a church that
[1:35:57] practice free love and all these go
[1:35:59] ungodly things, goes to baseball games
[1:36:02] and has big entertainments and social
[1:36:04] dances in the church is to be kept the
[1:36:08] word of God kept in a clean place. Amen.
[1:36:11] A clean place.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That's when the wayward man comes by, he
[1:36:15] can come into a clean place and be
[1:36:18] sprinkled with the waters of separation.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:22] I want you to know that the word of God
[1:36:25] and the message of the hour is a water
[1:36:28] of separation.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; It'll take the old filthy abominable
[1:36:34] things that you did
[1:36:38] cause you to get right.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; I was wrong.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Lord.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Cleanse you from old filthy habits.
[1:36:52] Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:57] How many of you remember when you first
[1:37:00] came to the message?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; It seemed like that every sermon was
[1:37:06] another piece of the world being hacked
[1:37:09] off of you.
[1:37:12] in this and in that and television and
[1:37:16] radios and comic books or whatever that
[1:37:20] you had and the next thing you know it's
[1:37:22] just being taken away from you and you
[1:37:25] you didn't sit there and begrudge God
[1:37:28] when he took it from you
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; but you said Lord okay I'm a sheep shear
[1:37:34] me Lord he said a real sheep says Hear
[1:37:39] me, Lord.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; In the marriage of the lamb, Esther
[1:37:53] perched her heart before God,
[1:37:56] washed up with a meek and humble spirit.
[1:37:58] The church that's going to be the bride
[1:38:00] of Christ. So now he's taking Esther, a
[1:38:03] church that's going to be the bride of
[1:38:05] Christ. Esther. Esther. Somebody say
[1:38:07] Esther.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Esther. Don't you love Esther, Ruth, and
[1:38:11] these different stories? My
[1:38:14] tell me about those women of faith.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Go before the king. If I perish, I
[1:38:21] perish.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Now remember, Esther refused the worldly
[1:38:29] adorement. She took the spirit in her
[1:38:31] heart
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; to go before the king. She took the
[1:38:35] spirit.
[1:38:37] It's a sweet, kind, reverent spirit of
[1:38:40] the word of God. Washed by the water of
[1:38:43] the word and the word in you. It's a
[1:38:45] washing. Amen. The church needs a
[1:38:47] washing. A full gospel washing. That's
[1:38:50] right. Not just a part washing, but a
[1:38:52] full gospel washing. Cleaned up, made
[1:38:56] new creatures in Christ Jesus.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Ordinary water won't do it.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, water is called a universal
[1:39:04] solvent.
[1:39:08] But even water baptism outside of godly
[1:39:12] repentance is only being
[1:39:16] going down a wet center and coming up or
[1:39:19] a dry center and coming up a wet one.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Because the precedent to water baptism
[1:39:27] is repentance,
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; a turning from your ways. Bring forth me
[1:39:32] fruits of repentance.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Not just saying, "Well, I'm sorry." No,
[1:39:39] a real godly.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, God. I turn from my ways.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Water baptism. There is no virtue in the
[1:39:48] water.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; It is in the act is only a symbol of
[1:39:54] what God is doing in your heart.
[1:39:59] And you were buried
[1:40:03] as the old man going down in oldness and
[1:40:07] coming up in newness of life.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Many people come to water baptism and
[1:40:15] stop right there
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; and they think that's enough. They
[1:40:20] believe on the Lord Jesus and stop.
[1:40:24] But you must keep going to the next step
[1:40:26] which is sanctification.
[1:40:29] Many people go to sanctification and
[1:40:31] stop.
[1:40:33] They don't keep going.
[1:40:36] They live a good, clean, holy life. They
[1:40:38] dress right. They talk right. Yet
[1:40:41] there's another step.
[1:40:44] Water, blood, spirit constitutes a
[1:40:47] birth. Somebody say birth.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Birth.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; A birth. water, blood, spirit is a
[1:40:53] birth.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; The new birth is not
[1:40:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not the seal of God.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; It's not the token.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; The new birth is simply a birth.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; It's a new creature in Christ Jesus. But
[1:41:16] now you are placed under tutors and
[1:41:19] governors to see are you faithful.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Though he be a son and heir to all
[1:41:27] things, he's no more than a servant.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; And he's under a time appointed by the
[1:41:33] father under tutors and governors
[1:41:37] for them to bring back a report. How's
[1:41:39] my son? How's my daughter doing?
[1:41:42] Ah, he ain't doing too good.
[1:41:46] He ain't listening.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; He's not ready to take his inheritance.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Doesn't have his father's character. A
[1:41:57] little renegade, a little shyer.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; He comes to church, but he listens, but
[1:42:04] he don't hear.
[1:42:07] See, God is wanting all of you when you
[1:42:11] come to church, hear what the spirit of
[1:42:13] God
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; is saying.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going slow and some of you are
[1:42:18] sleepy.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody stand up for a minute. Stand
[1:42:22] up. Stand up.
[1:42:24] Little calisthenics, a little raise your
[1:42:26] hands. Hallelujah. Okay, you feeling
[1:42:29] better now? Okay, go ahead and sit down.
[1:42:33] If you're not careful, what happens is
[1:42:35] while the word of God is going forth,
[1:42:37] you have a tendency to just, oh yeah, I
[1:42:39] know you love me and trust me so much
[1:42:41] that Lord, it's just such a blessing to
[1:42:44] be in tr.
[1:42:48] The new birth is not the baptism of the
[1:42:50] Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham, will all
[1:42:52] born again believers go in the rapture?
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:42:59] If you make the new birth, the baptism
[1:43:02] of the Holy Ghost and the seal, the
[1:43:04] token of God, then brother Brennham
[1:43:06] answers all of those questions
[1:43:08] incorrectly.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; No, he said only the Holy Ghost filled
[1:43:13] ones.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; So there's a difference between
[1:43:16] salvation
[1:43:18] and being sealed of God. Saved and not
[1:43:20] sealed.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Had he right asked for the salvation of
[1:43:24] her two boys,
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; right? Right?
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; They'll be saved. But are they bride?
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; If they were bride,
[1:43:34] if they were bride, they would be doing
[1:43:36] what the word tells them to do.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Many are called, but few are chosen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election
[1:43:47] sure.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Foolish virgin will be saved.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Had no oil.
[1:43:56] Come on.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Wasn't sealed of God. Are they going to
[1:44:00] do they have eternal life? Absolutely.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; They will be in heaven.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; They will have eternal life.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; They'll not live in the new Jerusalem.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Now, let's take the
[1:44:22] doctrinal teaching of the prophet and of
[1:44:24] the word of God.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Now, let me show you in the sermon, the
[1:44:28] countdown, 1962. Brother Brandon, so if
[1:44:32] a man sets on the thought of just sanct
[1:44:34] justification's all you have to have,
[1:44:37] he's wrong.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; He's got to be wrong. And if the church
[1:44:42] who believes that the like the many of
[1:44:45] the Pentecostals
[1:44:47] that the Holy Ghost is it, that's all.
[1:44:50] Just repent and get the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:53] That's still wrong.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Wow. Because you got to get
[1:44:58] sanctification in there to cleanse it
[1:45:00] before the Holy Ghost comes in. I want
[1:45:03] to ask you, do you think God seals an
[1:45:05] unholy vessel
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; contrary to God?
[1:45:11] He does not seal an unholy vessel.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; If you don't, you leave out the blood.
[1:45:18] See, the new birth as people talks about
[1:45:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new
[1:45:23] birth. Now, that's wrong.
[1:45:27] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:45:29] different from the new birth.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; The new birth is when you're born again.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost is when power comes
[1:45:37] into the birth for service.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Those disciples been serving the Lord
[1:45:44] Jesus for years under his ministry,
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; preaching the gospel,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; casting out devils with only a new
[1:45:54] birth.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And he told them, "I want you to go into
[1:45:58] Jerusalem
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; and tarry until you are endued with
[1:46:03] power."
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Power.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:46:10] It's power.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; It's a wonder working power.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Watch this.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to back that up, St.
[1:46:22] John 5:24, he that heareth my words and
[1:46:24] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:46:27] everlasting life. See, he's got life
[1:46:30] because he believes. And that same group
[1:46:32] had to go to Pentecost to be baptized
[1:46:34] with the Holy Ghost. See, exactly. Holy
[1:46:37] Ghost is powerful service. So when you
[1:46:38] talk you like like you got to be born
[1:46:41] again and applying that to the Holy
[1:46:43] Ghost, many of the Methodists and so
[1:46:45] forth are wrong there. And I want to say
[1:46:47] many message believers are wrong there.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; They are. I'm sorry.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; They just Well, you just do you believe
[1:46:56] the message? Yeah, you got the Holy
[1:46:58] Ghost.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, wait a second. I want to
[1:47:01] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:47:03] you believe?
[1:47:04] Let me see the fruits of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:07] in your life.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; He cannot just won't cope with it.
[1:47:14] See, they'd already believed to eternal
[1:47:16] life and so forth, but they had to have
[1:47:18] the Holy Ghost for power. You shall be
[1:47:21] witnesses unto me after the Holy Ghost
[1:47:23] is come upon you because the Holy Ghost
[1:47:26] is a witness of the resurrection showing
[1:47:28] that you have become an adult in Christ.
[1:47:33] no longer bases with the sincere milk of
[1:47:35] the word, but now you have become
[1:47:37] adults,
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Those who are of full age, born again.
[1:47:43] You're a baby. I don't know any of you
[1:47:46] sisters that gave birth
[1:47:49] to a full grown man.
[1:47:52] Oh, he might have been a big baby. He
[1:47:55] might have been a 10 pound whopper,
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; but you know what? He's still baby.
[1:48:04] still got to go in the milk and
[1:48:05] everything. That That's right.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; So, the new birth is you're a new
[1:48:10] creature in Christ Jesus. You're a baby
[1:48:12] and you got to learn to walk.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; You got to learn to walk before you run
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; and you're going to fall down. You're
[1:48:18] going to make mistakes. Yeah. That's
[1:48:19] what life is all about.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Is hey, you know, your parents, they
[1:48:25] they're pretty smart. My dad, you know,
[1:48:27] he was one of these guys, especially us
[1:48:29] boys, you know, we trip and fall. We run
[1:48:33] all the way home from the ball field.
[1:48:36] Your elbows got a big old knot on it
[1:48:38] like this out here cuz you tripped and
[1:48:40] fell or you're riding your bicycle and
[1:48:42] you went over the handlebars and you
[1:48:44] went home and you didn't even cry till
[1:48:46] you got about two blocks from the house
[1:48:48] and then and by the time you got to the
[1:48:50] door, you're losing it.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; What's the matter? What's the matter? I
[1:48:55] fell. I fell. So what?
[1:49:00] It's too far from your heart to kill
[1:49:02] you. Get back out there.
[1:49:06] I wanted sympathy. I didn't get any
[1:49:07] sympathy.
[1:49:10] Some of you want to be babyed so much
[1:49:13] you fall. You have a issue. Oh. Oh, I
[1:49:15] need you to be pray. No, you don't need
[1:49:17] prayer.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Get back up. Go on.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; You don't need hands laid on you. No.
[1:49:24] Oh, well come. Oh, come here. Come here,
[1:49:27] baby. Come here.
[1:49:30] Could you see me taking this brother?
[1:49:32] Come up here. Come up here, my brother.
[1:49:34] Sit on daddy's lap. Oh, good. Huh? Or
[1:49:38] brother David? Huh? Come up here,
[1:49:41] brother David. Sit right here. Are you
[1:49:44] kidding me?
[1:49:51] You're born children,
[1:49:54] babies. You grow to be adults. Key to
[1:49:57] the door, Brother Ram said. So communion
[1:49:59] is for Christians. It's born again.
[1:50:01] We're taking communion tonight.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Communion is for those that are born
[1:50:05] again
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God. And born again
[1:50:08] does not necessarily mean that you got
[1:50:10] the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Now remember now many teach that. I
[1:50:17] don't know anybody that teaches it like
[1:50:20] this as old brother Arggonite and the
[1:50:23] other night from the pulver sea. The new
[1:50:25] birth
[1:50:27] is not the baptism of the holy spirit.
[1:50:31] Scripture doesn't support it.
[1:50:34] I don't think so. See to my way of
[1:50:37] seeing it. Amen.
[1:50:40] There's a vast difference between having
[1:50:42] salvation
[1:50:46] and being bride.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; It's your faith in the word of God that
[1:50:54] cleanses you.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Your faith in God's word is what
[1:51:00] purifies your heart. the revelation of
[1:51:02] God's word. Not just hearing it, not
[1:51:05] hearing preachers preach about it,
[1:51:07] though it be taught so eloquent. Though
[1:51:10] you have graphs and pictures and ooh and
[1:51:13] awe and oh that's how it is. Oh my, I
[1:51:16] never saw it like that until revelation
[1:51:20] takes it from head knowledge down into a
[1:51:23] inspiration in your heart and the
[1:51:26] inspiration becomes a manifestation.
[1:51:31] Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; It's your faith.
[1:51:38] It's you sanctifying yourself.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; But let me clarify that. I feel a little
[1:51:45] checked. It's not your faith. It's a
[1:51:47] gift of God. God gave you the faith, but
[1:51:49] yet you got it.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:53] For by grace are you saved through
[1:51:54] faith, and that being a gift of God,
[1:51:57] huh, and not of works, lest any man
[1:51:59] boast.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; So the the gift of faith
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; is given to you freely,
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; but you got to use it.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; What is What good is it to have the gift
[1:52:13] of faith and you never use it?
[1:52:19] What good is it to have a tool in your
[1:52:20] toolbox and you never use it?
[1:52:27] Now in Acts 15:es 7-9,
[1:52:31] and when there had been much disputing,
[1:52:33] Peter rose up and said unto them, "Men
[1:52:35] and brethren, you know how that God that
[1:52:38] a good while ago God made choice among
[1:52:41] us that the Gentiles by my mouth should
[1:52:45] hear the word of the gospel and believe.
[1:52:49] And God which knoweth the hearts, bear
[1:52:51] them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost
[1:52:53] even as he did unto us, and put no
[1:52:57] difference between us and them,
[1:52:58] purifying their hearts by faith. Do you
[1:53:03] see what God's doing? He's purifying
[1:53:05] their hearts through a revelation that
[1:53:07] God is giving them.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; So that's what the bride of Christ is
[1:53:12] doing today. Her revelation is actually
[1:53:15] her cleansing.
[1:53:17] She's being washed by the water of the
[1:53:19] word. She's being cleansed by the word
[1:53:22] which she has heard spoken. She, if
[1:53:26] she's catching the revelation and
[1:53:28] applying it, she is then washed by the
[1:53:30] revelation of the word.
[1:53:34] 1 Corinthians 6 9-12.
[1:53:38] And know ye not that the unrighteous
[1:53:40] shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
[1:53:44] Be not deceived, neither fornicators,
[1:53:48] nor idolattors,
[1:53:50] nor adulterers,
[1:53:52] nor effeminate,
[1:53:55] nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
[1:53:59] nor thieves, nor covetous,
[1:54:02] nor drunkards, nor revilers,
[1:54:06] nor extortioners shall inherit the
[1:54:09] kingdom of God.
[1:54:12] And such were some of you,
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; but ye were washed.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Hey, I say I'm guilty.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; All of the above.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; But I've been washed.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the washing.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; But you are sanctified. You are
[1:54:33] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:54:35] and by the spirit of God. All things are
[1:54:38] lawful unto me, but all things are not
[1:54:41] expedient.
[1:54:42] All things are lawful for me, but I will
[1:54:45] be brought I will not be brought under
[1:54:48] the power of any.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; St. John 17:1 17 says, "Sanctify them
[1:54:57] through thy truth.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Thy word
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; is truth.
[1:55:09] That's what the revelation of God's word
[1:55:11] does to you. It sanctifies you. Sanctify
[1:55:13] you.
[1:55:15] Sanctifies you through the truth.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Did you realize that when you have
[1:55:20] received the spoken word of the hour
[1:55:23] because you got to recognize your day
[1:55:25] and its message.
[1:55:28] Amen.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; And when you receive that, actually,
[1:55:30] what's happening to you? You're being
[1:55:32] sanctified by the word of God that's
[1:55:35] been sent to you.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Don't you realize Moses's word
[1:55:39] sanctified Israel?
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Samuel's word sanctified the people.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Paul's word sanctified the people.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Luther's word.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Wesley's
[1:55:59] This prophet of the end time has
[1:56:01] sanctified
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; the people.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; It's a message. It's a separating
[1:56:06] message.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Everybody who likes a likes a a mixer,
[1:56:12] not a separator.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; I want a guy that'll compromise and
[1:56:16] well, hey, don't preach it so hard. Come
[1:56:18] on, man. Back off. Relax.
[1:56:22] I remember my brother and I going to a
[1:56:24] high school reunion.
[1:56:27] My brother and I were popular in high
[1:56:29] school. I'll admit that.
[1:56:33] No brag, just fact.
[1:56:37] People like twins. Oh, are you twins?
[1:56:40] Yeah. Anyway,
[1:56:44] it was, I think, a five or 10 year
[1:56:46] reunion and we were back in Monrovia,
[1:56:49] California.
[1:56:51] uh where we had gone to high school and
[1:56:54] we went to a a little steak place
[1:56:58] and we were standing in line to make our
[1:57:01] order for the steak and
[1:57:05] the girl standing behind my brother and
[1:57:07] I.
[1:57:09] And uh so anyway, my brother had at that
[1:57:14] time he had left the message, went back
[1:57:16] to California, started his own surfboard
[1:57:18] shop and his Lucadia surf and skiing and
[1:57:22] he grew his hair long and he was all tan
[1:57:24] and he had a gold chain around his neck
[1:57:26] and he's wearing shorts and sandals and
[1:57:29] you know looking hip for his time. And
[1:57:32] so anyway, we're standing in line. We're
[1:57:34] getting ready to order and the girl
[1:57:36] behind us says, "Excuse me, excuse me."
[1:57:39] She asked, "Uh, uh, are you one of the
[1:57:44] twins?" Speaking to my brother. Oh, yes.
[1:57:47] Yes. Oh, uh, which one are you, Ronard?
[1:57:50] Oh, I'm Don. Oh, wow. Wow. That's so
[1:57:54] nice. Where is your brother? And I'm
[1:57:56] standing right next to him. I'm his
[1:57:57] twin.
[1:58:00] She She says, "Where is Ron?"
[1:58:03] He's right here. She looked at me and
[1:58:07] looked at him and said, "Oh, you look so
[1:58:12] plain."
[1:58:18] Later, my brother, he says, "You look so
[1:58:21] plain."
[1:58:23] I said, "I can't wait for God to burn
[1:58:26] off this loud Jezebel, you know." Hey,
[1:58:30] relax. Relax, man. Don't get on my king.
[1:58:35] Yeah. I started putting him back on him.
[1:58:38] Anyway, do you know what? God has called
[1:58:40] you to be different,
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; saints of God. He has He has called you.
[1:58:44] He has sanctified you. And you sanctify
[1:58:47] yourselves. And if you don't sanctify
[1:58:49] yourselves, if you don't look different,
[1:58:51] you're not.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; If you look like the world, act like the
[1:58:55] world, talk like the world, you are of
[1:58:57] the world.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that the children of
[1:59:07] Israel had been affected for 400 years
[1:59:11] under the Egyptian rule and the Egyptian
[1:59:14] culture
[1:59:16] for 400 years in captivity
[1:59:21] and that culture had an effect on them.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:25] even to the point when they they were
[1:59:28] delivered by Moses, sanctified under his
[1:59:30] ministry, went out in there and they
[1:59:33] wanted to go back to the leaks and
[1:59:35] garlics.
[1:59:36] Right?
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; They forgot the taskmaster.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Not only that,
[1:59:45] but the Canaanites
[1:59:48] upon whom they were to enter the land
[1:59:51] and take the land and fight against the
[1:59:53] inhabitants thereof.
[1:59:56] That had an effect on them also. Listen,
[2:00:00] Louda has an effect on you.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; You young people, old people, every one
[2:00:04] of you listen to me. It has an effect.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; You're in it.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; You're right in the midst of the worst
[2:00:11] of all times of the media and of music
[2:00:14] and of books and of everything around
[2:00:17] you and the people and the people's
[2:00:19] minds have gone crazy. Hey, you're the
[2:00:21] only normal ones in this whole city.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Everybody else,
[2:00:28] I went shopping the other day with a
[2:00:30] wife and I sat down in a chair and I
[2:00:34] just said, "You go shop. I'll wait till
[2:00:36] you I'll just pay for it when you get
[2:00:37] done. Just go shopping. I'm sitting
[2:00:40] there and u the people that come in I
[2:00:44] looked at them and I said, "Oh my."
[2:00:47] Have you guys opened your eyes and seen
[2:00:49] what the people look like?
[2:00:54] I I said, "God,
[2:00:57] take me out of this place."
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Huh? Remember, Brother Ram said, "I went
[2:01:02] into the regions of the lost." Remember,
[2:01:03] he's a young boy. He he says, "I went
[2:01:05] into a vision. I saw women with their
[2:01:07] with their makeup on and green eyes and
[2:01:10] everything like that."
[2:01:13] He said, "There I was in where was it? J
[2:01:15] C Penney or May Company or something.
[2:01:17] He's on an escalator. Here come the
[2:01:18] women up the deal." And he they had all
[2:01:20] the same pain. And he said,
[2:01:24] he says, "Oh my, I got so upset." I
[2:01:28] said, "Ma, ma, I got to go." Why? He was
[2:01:32] seeing what he had seen in a vision of
[2:01:35] souls in prison and the things was
[2:01:38] happening.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh my,
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; are we there?"
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; The lid of hell, understand, has been
[2:01:46] ripped off.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; But anytime that the devil makes a move,
[2:01:50] God makes a counter move.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; God's not going to let you suffer. God's
[2:01:55] not going to let you uh uh uh not have a
[2:01:58] way of escape. God gives you a way of
[2:02:00] escape.
[2:02:01] But many times you don't you don't
[2:02:03] recognize it.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, like that that guy that during the
[2:02:06] flood Matthew Vasaki was talking to me
[2:02:09] the other day. He said, "Yeah, the guy
[2:02:10] you you know he's on the roof of his
[2:02:12] house and and you know, God, why didn't
[2:02:15] he wound up drowning?
[2:02:17] Wound up drowning." And and when he got
[2:02:19] to heaven, he said, "God, I thought you
[2:02:20] were I asked you to save me." He said,
[2:02:22] "I sent a boat. You told the guys in a
[2:02:24] boat, it's okay. He'll he'll Yeah, I
[2:02:26] sent you a helicopter. You told the guy,
[2:02:28] "It's okay. I'll be all right." I wonder
[2:02:30] how many times God has sent you a boat,
[2:02:32] a helicopter, a way out, and you just
[2:02:35] I'll be all right. I can It's okay. Go
[2:02:37] ahead, God. Go to sleep in my boat. I
[2:02:39] can handle this.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; You can't handle it.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Wake up, Jesus.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Canaanites have influence on you.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; It's all around you. You rub shoulders
[2:02:54] with them every day.
[2:02:57] In Exodus 23:es 31-33, "And I will set
[2:03:01] thy bounds from the Red Sea, even under
[2:03:04] the sea of Philistines, and from the
[2:03:05] desert under the river. For I will
[2:03:08] deliver the inhabitants of the land into
[2:03:10] your hand, and thou shalt drive them out
[2:03:13] before thee,
[2:03:16] and thou shalt make no covenant with
[2:03:18] them,
[2:03:20] nor with their gods,
[2:03:23] and they shall not dwell in the land,
[2:03:25] lest they make thee sin against me.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; If thou serve their gods,
[2:03:33] it will surely be a snare unto thee.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:39] Leviticus 18:es 3-4. After the doings of
[2:03:43] the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, you
[2:03:47] shall not do.
[2:03:51] After the doings of the land of Canaan,
[2:03:54] whether I bring you, you shall not do,
[2:03:59] neither shall you walk in their
[2:04:01] ordinances.
[2:04:02] Ye shall do my judgments
[2:04:06] and keep mine ordinances to walk
[2:04:08] therein. I am the Lord your God.
[2:04:12] Israel failed to keep themselves
[2:04:14] sanctified
[2:04:15] amongst the people of the land.
[2:04:20] I'm wondering is that happening to us?
[2:04:24] Are you failing to keep yourselves your
[2:04:26] house
[2:04:29] sanctified before the Lord?
[2:04:32] I'm asking you, judge yourself.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Remember one of the last things that
[2:04:39] Joshua told the children of Israel when
[2:04:42] they're crossing over into Canaan,
[2:04:45] sanctify yourselves.
[2:04:47] And then he's told, "Circumcise Israel
[2:04:50] again."
[2:04:52] Like we heard the other day talk about
[2:04:53] two circum there's only one
[2:04:55] circumcision.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; You don't circumcise a man twice.
[2:05:02] stay with the scriptural teaching.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Now, even Joshua questioned the Lord.
[2:05:08] But I'm going to show you.
[2:05:11] I think sometimes what happens is we
[2:05:14] fail
[2:05:16] to do all of the word of God just like
[2:05:18] Israel did. And they're in a movement of
[2:05:20] God. And yet even Moses
[2:05:23] failed to circumcise.
[2:05:28] Huh?
[2:05:29] Thank God for Zapora.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Zapora, are you here?
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Stand up for the word of God.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Thou art a bloody husband to me.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Joshua 5:es 2-7. And at that time the
[2:05:46] Lord said unto Joshua, "Make thee sharp
[2:05:48] knives,
[2:05:50] circumcise
[2:05:52] again the children of Israel the second
[2:05:54] time." Whoa.
[2:05:56] I thought there was only one
[2:05:57] circumcision. circumcised them a second
[2:06:01] time. Now God's going to clarify it for
[2:06:04] him otherwise it becomes unclear and
[2:06:07] Joshua made him sharp knives circumcised
[2:06:10] the children of Israel at the hill of
[2:06:12] foreskins and this is the cause why
[2:06:14] Joshua did circumcise here you want to
[2:06:17] know cause
[2:06:19] and effect you want to know here it is
[2:06:21] here's the cause all the people that
[2:06:24] came out of Egypt that were males even
[2:06:26] all the men of war died in the
[2:06:28] wilderness by the way after they came
[2:06:30] out of Egypt And
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; now all the people that came out were
[2:06:34] circumcised. All the old people
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; they were circumcised.
[2:06:40] But all the people who were born in the
[2:06:42] wilderness, by the way, as they came
[2:06:44] forth out of Egypt, them had not been
[2:06:46] circumcised.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; We're so caught up in the message.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; We're so busy.
[2:06:54] We failed to tell our own kids, you need
[2:06:57] to have the Holy Ghost. You need to be
[2:06:59] circumcised. Amen.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Says the children walked 40 years. Verse
[2:07:07] seven, and their children whom they
[2:07:09] raised in theirstead, God raises up
[2:07:12] them. Joshua circumcised. Who got
[2:07:15] circumcised? There was nobody
[2:07:16] circumcised. The second time Israel was
[2:07:19] circumcised because the others it did
[2:07:21] them no good. It became just a
[2:07:24] Huh. Even Paul said circumcision,
[2:07:27] uncircumcision, nothing.
[2:07:30] because you have made it like a law.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Not because you were adherent to the
[2:07:37] word.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; It just became a ritual.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; It was necessary
[2:07:47] for God to tell them to do this because
[2:07:49] they failed to sanctify
[2:07:52] their own families.
[2:07:56] Now in doing so, remember as I started
[2:07:59] with the scripture,
[2:08:01] may you be wholly sanctified
[2:08:04] in your body and in your spirit and in
[2:08:07] your soul. Now, brother Brennham says in
[2:08:11] the sermon, the rapture,
[2:08:14] I got two I got this quote and then I
[2:08:16] got I'm going to pass out some paper
[2:08:20] here to you so you guys can have some.
[2:08:22] I've only I said I don't know how many
[2:08:24] will want it. So, I think we only did
[2:08:26] 70. But if you want one, well, I'm going
[2:08:28] to give one to the head of the family
[2:08:31] and you can share it with your wife and
[2:08:32] your kids. And our young people, you
[2:08:34] should get one yourself. But in the
[2:08:37] sermon, the rapture,
[2:08:40] you say, "I got the baptism, the Holy
[2:08:42] Ghost."
[2:08:44] That don't mean
[2:08:46] that you're saved. Not by a long ways.
[2:08:49] Woo! Woo!
[2:08:53] Somebody say amen to that.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; What does he mean?
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; That don't mean you're saved. Not by a
[2:09:04] long ways.
[2:09:06] I understand. That's why you got to read
[2:09:08] before, you got to read after.
[2:09:10] Otherwise, you're going to get confused
[2:09:11] and your kids are going to say, "Well,
[2:09:13] my somebody told me I need the Holy
[2:09:14] Ghost and that's the token and and you
[2:09:16] ain't going without the token. And if it
[2:09:18] got to token, I'm going and I'm in and
[2:09:20] on and on. And now he said, "I don't
[2:09:22] mean nothing."
[2:09:26] He said, "Look at here. You're a triune
[2:09:28] V. You are inside this little fellow
[2:09:31] here is is the soul. The next is the
[2:09:34] spirit. The next is the body."
[2:09:36] Now, you got five senses in this body to
[2:09:39] contact your earthly home.
[2:09:43] They don't contact the rest of it. It's
[2:09:45] just your earthly home. Right?
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; You got five senses of the spirit
[2:09:50] here. Love and conscience, so forth. But
[2:09:53] here is where you live. That's what you
[2:09:57] are. He's talking about the soul, the
[2:09:59] heart. That's who you are.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; That's what you are.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Brethren, go ahead and come forth if you
[2:10:06] have. Did we Did we print out some of
[2:10:08] those, brethren? Did you do that?
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; On the coffee bar.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; They're on the coffee bar. Okay. I tell
[2:10:13] you what. We won't waste time right now.
[2:10:15] I'm just going to put it on the
[2:10:16] overhead. But you that want one, when
[2:10:19] you leave, you get one at the coffee bar
[2:10:21] cuz you know what? I'm going to use it
[2:10:22] next service.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram then says, "Now Jesus said,
[2:10:30] rain falls on the just and the unjust.
[2:10:34] One of them will be a cockleberg because
[2:10:36] that's all he is. The cockab will raise
[2:10:39] his hand, shout just like the same as
[2:10:42] the wheat." So, let me close with this
[2:10:46] graph here. And I'm just going to take
[2:10:48] this and expound on it just a moment.
[2:10:51] And I've got a laser here. Yeah, it
[2:10:54] works.
[2:10:56] Now, I want you to see the threepart
[2:11:01] nature of man. You have the outer court,
[2:11:05] the inner court, and the holy of holies.
[2:11:07] This is the same as the tabernacle in
[2:11:10] the wilderness.
[2:11:14] Okay, now this is many of you have not
[2:11:17] been around when I did this teaching
[2:11:19] years ago and I'm sorry for the graphs
[2:11:21] and I, you know, I tried to take the
[2:11:24] picture that I had from something I
[2:11:26] taught uh years ago and send it to the
[2:11:30] and I didn't know how to do it. I
[2:11:31] couldn't, you know, copy paste and
[2:11:33] everything. I just got lost. Finally, I
[2:11:35] took that which I had. I said I gave it
[2:11:38] to Ethan. I said, "Have them print it
[2:11:39] up. Have them do it." So now you have
[2:11:42] the outer court, the old man. And we
[2:11:46] show you the scriptures. 1 Thessalonians
[2:11:48] 5:23,
[2:11:50] Hebrews 4. And so now understand that
[2:11:56] this flesh man, he's the outer court.
[2:11:59] He's the
[2:12:00] that brother Brandham also calls it the
[2:12:02] living room.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[2:12:06] And he says, "Now watch this. First pull
[2:12:11] has to do only with the outer court,
[2:12:13] with the flesh man
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; laying hands on the sick. It's the body.
[2:12:18] It's healing the sick. That's the body.
[2:12:20] Okay. But then he goes into the second
[2:12:23] pole. He starts discerning the spirit.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Huh? Oh, I see. You're not from here.
[2:12:29] You're from another city. Oh, I see. I
[2:12:31] see what's troubling you." So now he
[2:12:33] starts discerning spirit because what he
[2:12:36] couldn't see on the outside he now
[2:12:39] begins to discern
[2:12:41] using discernment of spirit.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. And so now here's where I want to
[2:12:49] start and lay a foundation for you and
[2:12:52] show you that there are these gates that
[2:12:56] lead into
[2:13:00] or has an effect upon the carnal man.
[2:13:03] See, taste, smell, feel, hear. And every
[2:13:08] one of you when you were a baby,
[2:13:11] everything that was a stimuli around
[2:13:16] you, you tried to understand your world
[2:13:19] by seeing it, tasting it, feeling it
[2:13:22] like babies.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's why you put these little
[2:13:26] chandeliers in front of them and it
[2:13:28] spins and moves in a little be.
[2:13:33] And then finally, he reaches up and he
[2:13:34] grabs one. What does he want to do?
[2:13:39] He wants to taste it. Why? He's trying
[2:13:41] to assimulate
[2:13:43] to his little body. What is that? What
[2:13:47] does it do? Uh and everything. So, see t
[2:13:51] then he smells it. Huh? Whatever. You
[2:13:54] take a little rattle. Huh? Mamas, you
[2:13:56] got little rattles. Kids love rattles.
[2:13:59] I went to the carnival one time and I
[2:14:01] bought me or I I won. You know those
[2:14:03] rings you throw and you go around a
[2:14:05] bottle and you win something? I won one
[2:14:06] of these whistles
[2:14:10] and it was a shrill, a high shrill.
[2:14:15] Well, I went through the house just
[2:14:17] blowing that thing as hard as I could.
[2:14:21] And it it was a
[2:14:24] I was mesmerized. I was locked. I was in
[2:14:27] tune. My eyes was closed.
[2:14:31] And all of a sudden, this hand come
[2:14:36] broke that thing. I looked at my mom.
[2:14:38] She's going, "You're driving me nuts.
[2:14:44] It's a whistle.
[2:14:47] You must be crazy."
[2:14:50] You see, kids, they do silly things.
[2:14:53] They like loud. Huh?
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; God, remember not the sins of my youth?
[2:14:58] You remember how you used to like a loud
[2:15:00] car, loud muffer?
[2:15:04] Yeah. Go through a tunnel.
[2:15:08] Like it was, you know, or or music. You
[2:15:10] liked it loud. You turn it up, man.
[2:15:14] Now, as the older I get, I want silence.
[2:15:20] Silence.
[2:15:25] And yet I look back and I say,
[2:15:28] God, thank you.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; I don't want a loud muffler now. I
[2:15:33] don't. Huh?
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; I I rode in a Tesla the other day. This
[2:15:37] is the second time I've ever been in a
[2:15:39] Tesla. Wow. Silent.
[2:15:43] There's no turning on the motor. There's
[2:15:48] We just start moving.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; This is weird.
[2:15:53] And you know this thing, it it parks
[2:15:55] itself. It drives itself. I never said
[2:15:57] he said, "You want to see something?" He
[2:15:59] said, "This thing drives itself." Auto
[2:16:01] drive like this. He starts talking to
[2:16:04] me. I'm getting nervous, man. Watch the
[2:16:09] This thing drives itself. It parks
[2:16:10] itself.
[2:16:13] Huh?
[2:16:15] But I don't know why I'm saying all
[2:16:17] that, but um this technology and
[2:16:21] everything that we're in now
[2:16:24] and and youth
[2:16:27] the God, may we have
[2:16:32] and
[2:16:34] may we have understanding for our youth,
[2:16:40] moms, dads, listen to me.
[2:16:44] I I went to dinner with my daughter and
[2:16:47] my grandson
[2:16:49] the other day at Malachi.
[2:16:52] We sat at the table
[2:16:57] My daughter says, "Uh, Dad,
[2:17:00] if you had it to do all over again,
[2:17:02] would you do anything different?"
[2:17:06] Man,
[2:17:08] I put my head down
[2:17:13] because I I thought of all the things
[2:17:17] how that I applied the law. I didn't
[2:17:20] understand them.
[2:17:21] I I was so
[2:17:24] legalistic.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; I said, Rebecca, I said, knowing what I
[2:17:31] know now,
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; I said I would do things different. But
[2:17:35] I didn't know what I know now then. And
[2:17:39] I said, if I haded to do all over again,
[2:17:41] I would have done the exact same thing
[2:17:43] because at the moment, I thought it was
[2:17:45] right. And yet I was hoping there would
[2:17:47] be an elder or somebody that would come
[2:17:49] and shake me up and say, "Son, let your
[2:17:53] kids be kids."
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; They make mistakes.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; They do stupid things.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm not putting you down.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; They do.
[2:18:11] Don't put that bean up your nostril.
[2:18:17] And guess what? As soon as you leave,
[2:18:19] up it goes. Why? You told them not to do
[2:18:22] it. Don't touch that. It's hot.
[2:18:26] Guess what they got to do? How hot?
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Some kids learn by just telling them
[2:18:30] it's hot. Don't touch it.
[2:18:33] Okay, won't touch it. Some of your kids
[2:18:37] How hot?
[2:18:40] Right. And guess what? the kids. The
[2:18:43] apple don't fall far from the tree.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Was you stubborn, hard-headed?
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Did you give your mom and dad a problem
[2:18:51] now and then?
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; I am cursed by my mother.
[2:18:58] My mother, we gave her such a hard time.
[2:19:01] She says, "Son, I hope when you grow up
[2:19:03] and you get married, you have kids just
[2:19:07] like you.
[2:19:12] My mother didn't
[2:19:15] understand. I'm a far better grandfather
[2:19:18] as a father than I was as a father
[2:19:21] because I know something now.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; I know something. I I've got some
[2:19:27] experience and I I love my kids and my
[2:19:31] grandkids and we had some over to the
[2:19:34] house the other day in Prescuit and I
[2:19:36] tell you what, I just I loved it. I
[2:19:38] loved it. I just want my family with me.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Now, what about our spiritual family? I
[2:19:45] just want my family with me.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I realize some of the kids say,
[2:19:49] "Yeah, they're they're having a hard
[2:19:52] time." And I'm going to show you. Let's
[2:19:54] go back to our graph here for a moment.
[2:19:58] And just going to show you now. God uses
[2:20:03] one of these gates for the seed of God
[2:20:06] to come and make its way. Now, here's a
[2:20:09] womb. This is the mind. The mind is the
[2:20:14] womb to your spirit.
[2:20:18] You understand that? The mind. Where's
[2:20:21] the greatest battle ever fought?
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; Where is the seed aborted?
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; In the womb. the spermicide of unbelief.
[2:20:34] You can hear the word and say, "I don't
[2:20:36] believe it." And the spermicide kills
[2:20:39] the germ of life.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says that faith cometh by
[2:20:52] hearing, hearing the word of God. So God
[2:20:55] uses the heargate for you. He that
[2:20:59] heareth my words.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; So the through the process of hearing
[2:21:06] you hear the word it comes into the mind
[2:21:10] and where's the greatest battle ever
[2:21:11] fought mind.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Where is it that most of us have our
[2:21:17] greatest battle in my mind.
[2:21:24] We're going to get into this a further
[2:21:26] later
[2:21:28] and through then now here you have these
[2:21:33] five gates to the spirit musicians if
[2:21:36] you come I'm closing with this you guys
[2:21:38] when you leave take a copy of this and
[2:21:40] you look at it because we'll go over
[2:21:42] this graph uh when we come to church
[2:21:46] again and then we'll talk about the five
[2:21:48] gates to the spirit
[2:21:50] memory
[2:21:52] imagination, conscience, affection, and
[2:21:55] reason.
[2:21:56] Because many times ministers are not
[2:22:00] really preaching the word. They're
[2:22:01] preaching emotion,
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; sensation,
[2:22:05] reasoning.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, you can just imagine how many
[2:22:09] of you, you want to go to heaven, you
[2:22:12] want to see your grandma. Yes. Yes.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; I want to be there. Yes. it, you know,
[2:22:18] and so you use the memory, the
[2:22:21] imagination, the conscience, the
[2:22:23] affection. But where what gate was it
[2:22:26] that the devil used on Eve in the Garden
[2:22:29] of Eden?
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Reasoning. What gate will he use against
[2:22:35] most of you?
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Reasoning. Amen. Amen.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; I'm doing what I do because I justify it
[2:22:46] in my own reasoning.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Sometimes what you go through,
[2:22:58] it's self-inflicted.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; You reasoned that it was okay and it
[2:23:05] wasn't.
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:10] If we're not careful,
[2:23:13] ministers come right along.
[2:23:16] And I'll give you an example with
[2:23:17] brother Brandham.
[2:23:20] His first sermon.
[2:23:23] He said, "The first sermon I preached,"
[2:23:26] he said, "Like a young lawyer, I got up
[2:23:28] there,
[2:23:30] ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm
[2:23:32] going to prove my case." He get up here
[2:23:34] and he said, "I took the word of God and
[2:23:36] I cried. They cried." And he said,
[2:23:38] "Everybody cried." He said, "I went back
[2:23:40] to the back room. How'd I do?" Worst
[2:23:44] sermon I ever heard. Bill, what? But
[2:23:48] they cried.
[2:23:51] He said, "Bill, you just stomped around
[2:23:53] and just used the channel of emotion and
[2:23:56] affection. Got them all crying." He
[2:23:58] said, "You never even said the word."
[2:24:02] boy. He said, "Took the wind right out
[2:24:03] of my sails."
[2:24:06] I want to then go through some of this
[2:24:09] stuff
[2:24:11] and show you how the devil will fight
[2:24:13] you
[2:24:15] to the realm of your spirit by using
[2:24:18] your memory,
[2:24:20] your own imagination.
[2:24:23] How many of you have ever had an issue
[2:24:25] in your life and you only imagined it?
[2:24:28] It wasn't really there, but you imagined
[2:24:31] it. And so your imagination made it so
[2:24:35] real
[2:24:37] that it hindered you.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; If you think people don't like you,
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; and they really do like you,
[2:24:49] but you imagine they don't. Nobody can
[2:24:51] tell you different.
[2:24:54] They don't like me. Nobody shakes my
[2:24:56] hand. I leave right after church and
[2:24:59] nobody stops me. Well, it's cuz you're
[2:25:01] the first one to the car.
[2:25:04] You're the first one to hit the door.
[2:25:07] The Bible says if you want to have
[2:25:10] friends,
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; show yourself friendly,
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; right? If you want fellowship, all of
[2:25:17] you understand this. There is never a
[2:25:19] perfect church.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; There's never a perfect No. And if you
[2:25:24] do find a perfect church, when you move
[2:25:26] there, it's now imperfect
[2:25:28] because you're going to find the
[2:25:29] imperfection there also.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; If you want fellowship, create it.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Invite people to your home. Don't wait
[2:25:38] to be invited. Invite others.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this morning.
[2:25:47] Anyway, uh so
[2:25:51] I have a couple other graphs.
[2:25:54] Do we have all three of them? Did we
[2:25:56] print all three?
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Okay, the other two are this. I'm going
[2:26:00] to show you how man's a triune being,
[2:26:02] body, spirit, soul. Showing you how
[2:26:05] one's inside of the other. Then we're
[2:26:08] going to go into the thing where brother
[2:26:09] Bram says, "Well, you say you got the
[2:26:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm saved."
[2:26:13] Said that that don't mean nothing.
[2:26:16] Well, he when you understand his
[2:26:18] teaching, it's because Pentecost says,
[2:26:20] "I spoke with tongues. Therefore, I know
[2:26:23] I got the Holy Ghost."
[2:26:25] He said, "No, tongues is not the
[2:26:27] evidence of the Holy Ghost." He said,
[2:26:29] "It talks about it's only the anointing
[2:26:32] on your spirit."
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; And then we'll look at the gifts of the
[2:26:37] spirit, activating gifts of the spirit.
[2:26:41] And you can have the Holy Spirit on your
[2:26:43] spirit and your soul.
[2:26:46] the control room, the devil's still
[2:26:48] sitting there.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; But when God comes in and he kills that
[2:26:54] old first nature and changes you and now
[2:26:58] he sits on your throne room, now
[2:27:02] he's in the control tower.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Does that mean that you don't have
[2:27:06] issues and there are things in your life
[2:27:09] and you're going to walk perfect from
[2:27:10] them on? No. No, of course not. You're
[2:27:13] going to have trials, tribulations,
[2:27:16] but you got to keep sanctifying your
[2:27:19] life. Amen. Come on, somebody. That's
[2:27:21] true. We need to sanctifi. We need to
[2:27:24] take a good look at ourselves.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; And fathers,
[2:27:29] do not chasen thy son if thou doest the
[2:27:32] same.
[2:27:36] Take care of your self first. Yeah.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Don't try to if you see somebody
[2:27:43] drowning and floundering and having a
[2:27:45] hard time, don't try to save somebody
[2:27:48] drowning if you don't know how to swim.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Because if you've ever tried to save
[2:27:56] somebody that's drowning and you don't
[2:27:59] know water safety rules and everything
[2:28:00] like that, they're going to drown you.
[2:28:02] Amen.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; So again, this just kind of a teaching
[2:28:11] lesson. I didn't really preach. It kind
[2:28:12] of went slowly
[2:28:14] and uh I did that for a purpose.
[2:28:18] But we're going to get into this these
[2:28:20] areas and we're going to be talking
[2:28:22] about possessing the gate of your enemy.
[2:28:26] And we're going to bring it down home
[2:28:27] and show you possess your gate of your
[2:28:30] imagination.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Of your conscience,
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; of your affection, of your reasoning.
[2:28:37] Huh?
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; That I might live a life
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; that is pleasing to you. And the only
[2:28:45] way you can do it, Lord, is change my
[2:28:48] heart.
[2:28:49] Thy word, oh Lord, have I hid in my
[2:28:51] heart that I learn not to sin against
[2:28:55] you.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh,
[2:29:02] [Music]
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; make it ever
[2:29:06] true.
[2:29:10] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:29:17] May I be like you
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; for you are the partner.
[2:29:27] [Music]
[2:29:30] I am the
[2:29:37] mold me and
[2:29:40] me.
[2:29:42] And this is what I pray.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh God.
[2:29:55] Make it ever true.
[2:30:01] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:30:07] May I be my You are the potter. I am the
[2:30:11] clay
[2:30:14] and you are the potter.
[2:30:20] I am the flame.
[2:30:24] [Music]
[2:30:26] Hold me and make me.
[2:30:32] This is what I
[2:30:36] change my heart. Change my heart. Oh
[2:30:41] God. God
[2:30:45] make it ever
[2:30:47] true.
[2:30:51] Change my heart. Oh God.
[2:30:55] [Music]
[2:30:57] May I be.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we bow our heads for a word of
[2:31:03] prayer or dismissal? Heavenly Father, we
[2:31:04] love you today. We ask you to lead us,
[2:31:08] guide us, inspire us, direct our
[2:31:10] footsteps, Lord. Prepare our hearts for
