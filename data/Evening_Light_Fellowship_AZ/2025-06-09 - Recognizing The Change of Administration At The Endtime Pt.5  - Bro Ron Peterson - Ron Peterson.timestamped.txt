[41:56] to shake your hand, so I want a
[41:57] blessing. If you've been in that
[41:59] honeypot lately, then you can rub some

[42:26] it's a blessing. Say hello to the
[42:28] people, man. Come on. Good morning,
[42:30] y'all. Uh it's good to be back to like
[42:33] uh Aaron said, the the father of our
[42:35] faith. We were in Idaho and came from a
[42:39] church that was a mess and we came here
[42:41] to a family. Oh, and brother Chad sends
[42:44] his greetings. He was blown away at the
[42:47] reception that he got when he came here.
[42:48] He's like, "Boy, those people really
[42:50] pull."
[42:52] He's like, "It was so easy. I just
[42:54] walked out." He's like, "These people
[42:55] were so hungry." So, it it's been a
[42:58] blessing to be at Brother Chad's church,
[43:00] but there's something about was it I
[43:02] don't know if it was the prophet said,
[43:04] you know, it's nice to meet new people
[43:05] and meet new friends, but there's
[43:06] something about coming back to old
[43:08] friends. So, we are just so blessed to
[43:11] be here. We'll leave it tomorrow. But it
[43:13] was a blessing to be in the service on
[43:15] Wednesday to hear, brother Ward. And I
[43:16] got to see you. And then you went with
[43:18] brother uh I forgot his name, our color
[43:21] brother that went back. I'm like, you

[43:26] when I would get to see you today, I'm
[43:28] like, well, brother Ron better be
[43:29] preaching on Sunday. So, I came here. It
[43:31] was because of you probably. Yes. Well,

[43:35] takes for us to cope. God bless you,
[43:38] man. Bless you, brother, my friend. Love

[44:41] Van
[44:42] Hayes, and then I knew Brother Von Kung
[44:46] Vuruga.
[44:48] [Music]

[44:57] closer. A little
[44:58] closer.
[45:00] Um, and so we've
[45:03] known the family and the church over

[45:14] our Yeah, he did. He came over and stole
[45:17] you. Yeah. I just I forgive him, you
[45:21] know. I asked her father. But you you
[45:24] did.
[45:28] Yeah. Well, the Lord bless you. And so
[45:31] now you guys are are leaving to go back
[45:34] to Belgium. When are you leaving? It
[45:36] will be in a week. In one week. Yeah.
[45:40] And so you're going over there and
[45:42] you're going to help your father with
[45:43] his work and get right back into that.
[45:45] And Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
[45:50] come up here and say a little something
[45:51] to the people. Yeah. Yeah.
[45:55] Yeah. Yeah. Well, I I I just thought
[45:58] what what would I say, but I I think the
[46:00] only thing I could say is thank you cuz
[46:03] uh Rachel has been part of of the family
[46:07] and yeah, um she Yeah, it's such a
[46:11] strength to her always to
[46:13] to hear you even from Belgium and she's
[46:17] she will still feel a part. And for me
[46:19] also, I I really feel part of you all.
[46:22] And just the little smiles and the the
[46:26] little talks you have after church and
[46:28] the ministry, it it it does a lot
[46:32] especially in these times to encourage
[46:34] each
[46:35] other and and just to walk
[46:38] together and we know we'll always be
[46:41] part of each other. So that's right.
[46:44] Yeah.
[46:45] Uh I'm just thankful for yeah everything
[46:48] the Lord does through everyone and
[46:51] through Bon and every one of you guys
[46:54] and uh I know he takes care of us where
[46:58] wherever we go but yes it wasn't easy
[47:01] but we know the Lord has his plan. I
[47:05] believe that the will of God will never
[47:08] take you where the grace of God cannot
[47:10] keep you. Amen.
[47:12] And so we're going to pray over them
[47:16] and they're going to go with our
[47:17] blessings.
[47:19] And uh though they will be absent from
[47:22] our presence, they won't be absent from
[47:24] our hearts.
[47:35] Yeah.
[47:38] So we're we're happy for you. We are.
[47:41] come back and see us
[47:44] every other month.
[47:48] And I know you guys will probably save
[47:50] up some money because you know you'll be
[47:52] visiting and spending some time with
[47:55] them. So let's just get together.
[47:58] Brother Stephen
[47:59] here, excuse my back to the
[48:02] congregation. I'm
[48:04] sorry. our kind heavenly father. As
[48:08] I put my arms around this family,
[48:12] Lord, this family that we love and that
[48:15] they have come here and sojourned with
[48:17] us for a season. But now, Father, you
[48:20] have seen fit for them to go back to his
[48:23] home country, to his people, his
[48:26] language. and Sister Rachel, she's going
[48:30] over, but she is a type even as Ruth
[48:34] said, "Your people will be my people."
[48:38] Your family, my family. So, Father, I I
[48:42] uh send them with a blessing.
[48:46] They will leave from our presence, but
[48:48] not our hearts. And so, Father, we pray
[48:50] over them and I ask you to bless their
[48:53] lives, watch over them, keep them safe,
[48:55] and Father, may they flourish in the
[48:58] word at Brother David Iverson's church
[49:00] and with the family there. I just pray
[49:04] uh multitudes of blessings be upon them
[49:07] and we send them,
[49:09] Father, with not a goodbye, but until we
[49:14] meet again. So, Father, I pray watch
[49:17] over them. We place them into thy hands.
[49:20] There is no better place than in thy
[49:23] hands. Keep them I pray in Jesus
[49:26] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[49:30] Amen. Hey, God bless you. God bless you.
[49:34] He loves
[49:37] his Stephen. God bless you. He loves his
[49:40] prophet. Yeah, he does. God bless you.
[49:43] Amen.
[49:45] Amen. Yes.
[49:53] Yeah. And um you know we just had our
[49:58] camp and um we had a very blessed time
[50:02] this year. We always do. God is unique
[50:04] in every
[50:05] camp and his presence came and was there
[50:08] with us. And um we had two camp speakers
[50:13] that we had invited and brother Matt
[50:16] McGary and uh he came and brother Steve
[50:21] Coffee and you have two kind of opposite
[50:25] ends of the spectrum as far as
[50:28] ministries. You have a little lively
[50:30] fireball Matt McGary. Hallelujah. Praise
[50:33] God. His voice raises up. Then you have
[50:36] Steve Coffee who's a pastor. He's a
[50:37] teacher. and he just stands there and
[50:40] you know every other sentence is a
[50:42] golden nugget and if you're trying to
[50:44] take notes uh he goes and you just you
[50:47] know but it was a blessed time and it
[50:50] was a good balance
[50:52] it was a very good balance to have that
[50:54] those type ministries and it's good for
[50:57] you to see the different types of
[51:00] ministries because the Bible says that
[51:02] God has many diversities of gifts but
[51:05] one spirit diversity iversities of
[51:08] ministries and yet one spirit, right?
[51:11] And so we thank God for that. I thank
[51:13] God not everybody's like me. How dull
[51:16] the world would be if everybody preached
[51:20] and acted like
[51:23] me. Nobody said amen. Well, that's
[51:27] okay. I can say it. Sometimes I don't
[51:30] like
[51:31] myself, so it's okay. Anyway, we uh we
[51:35] had a lovely time this year and
[51:39] uh
[51:41] uh I have a few pictures, but before I
[51:44] do, I Yeah, take that back down again.
[51:47] So, everybody, I want their attention.
[51:49] I'm sorry.
[51:51] Um and we had so many workers, so many
[51:55] helpers.
[51:57] Um, all of those that helped, the
[52:00] technicians, the musicians, the
[52:02] counselors, the people, the ones who the
[52:05] young couples that came and every one of
[52:08] you that had a portion or a part to play
[52:12] at camp. I thought I'd have you come up
[52:15] here, but it would take too much time,
[52:16] so I'm not going to do that. But I'm
[52:17] going to have you stand up. If you were
[52:19] a part of our camp this year, whether
[52:21] counselor or organizer, musician,
[52:24] whatever, stand up. Stand up. Come on.
[52:33] Yeah. God bless you. God bless you. My
[52:37] I'm just so proud of them. They all did
[52:39] such a a a tremendous job. I've got a
[52:42] few photos. The camp was excellent. The
[52:45] um sanctuary there, the chapel, you can
[52:48] see we went came out in front of it. The
[52:50] chapel's very nice. That's an exterior
[52:52] view. And uh there I think they took it
[52:55] with one of those drones. So yeah, there
[52:58] you
[53:04] go. Amen. That was uh was very nice. We
[53:09] had our morning devotions. Uh you know,
[53:11] I tried to pass that off and and say
[53:13] that I wanted to retire this year, but
[53:15] they wouldn't let me do it. So at
[53:16] mornings at 700 a.m., we got up and had
[53:18] a little Bible study. And and that's me
[53:20] there in front of the people. And that
[53:23] was outside in a little amphitheater. So
[53:25] that was a nice time. We just had a
[53:27] blessed time there. Uh brother Steve
[53:30] Coffee there as uh he said, "Brother
[53:33] Ron, do I have to wear a tie?" I said,
[53:34] "No, he did the first night, but then
[53:36] after he took it off and uh just got
[53:39] real comfortable." There's our brother
[53:41] Steven McNeely did a tremendous job of
[53:43] kind of orchestrating the whole thing
[53:45] and getting up making announcements.
[53:50] There's brother Matt McGary.
[53:56] Steve Coffee again I think that is yeah
[53:59] and then they had uh because the camp is
[54:02] so spread apart it's the campus itself
[54:06] is quite large so in order to go from
[54:08] the girls dormatory all the way to the
[54:11] sanctuary or to uh where we had our food
[54:14] at the uh cafeteria it was quite a walk.
[54:18] So, we uh had a truck with a trailer and
[54:21] hay bales and they all jumped on and got
[54:24] rides or they walked or whatever. So,
[54:26] this just a picture of that. Blessed be
[54:29] the name of the Lord. Listen, I'm going
[54:30] to do something
[54:32] different. That group that came up there
[54:34] and said, "It ain't over yet." I want
[54:37] you to get back up here.
[54:41] This was a great blessing.
[54:45] Go ahead and turn it on.
[54:48] to the questions, the fears and
[54:52] lies. Somebody
[54:55] here is desperate for
[54:59] freedom from the past, the chains, and
[55:03] the
[55:05] last. Feeling like you've wasted so much
[55:11] time. Want to move ahead, but you're
[55:14] still last in
[55:17] life. Feel like you're running will
[55:20] never

[55:26] win. See, I don't know who sold you. You
[55:31] could not make it. I don't know who sold
[55:35] you. You cannot take it. I don't know.
[55:41] It's time that you
[55:43] quit. My thoughts is wait a
[55:49] year. Somebody
[55:52] here needs an
[55:56] answer to the questions, the fears, and
[56:00] the wise. Somebody
[56:03] here is desperate for freedom. Amen.
[56:08] from the past, the chains, and the
[56:12] [Music]
[56:13] last. Feel like you wasted so much
[56:19] time. Want to move ahead, but you're
[56:22] still
[56:25] lasting. Feel like you're running will
[56:28] never
[56:30] end. And it will never win.
[56:35] But I don't know who told you you would
[56:38] not make it. I don't know who told you
[56:43] you could not take it. I don't know who
[56:47] told you that if that you quit.

[59:39] together.
[59:52] Let's sing only
[59:56] believe. Yes.
[59:59] Only
[1:00:03] believe.
[1:00:05] Only believe.
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:11] All things are
[1:00:16] possible.
[1:00:19] Only
[1:00:22] believe.
[1:00:24] Only
[1:00:29] believe.
[1:00:31] Only believe.
[1:00:36] All things are
[1:00:41] possible.
[1:00:44] Only believe. Let's sing. Lord, I
[1:00:48] believe.
[1:00:50] Lord, I believe. That's what we do.
[1:00:53] Believers believe.
[1:00:57] Lord, I believe.
[1:01:03] All things are
[1:01:08] possible. Lord,
[1:01:11] I
[1:01:14] believe.
[1:01:17] Lord, I believe.
[1:01:23] Lord, I believe.
[1:01:29] All things are
[1:01:34] possible. Lord,
[1:01:37] I believe.
[1:01:41] Let's bow our heads now.
[1:01:43] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:01:46] approach thee.
[1:01:48] We would ask, Father, as we lay our
[1:01:51] gifts at your feet now, humble
[1:01:54] ourselves and we realize, Father,
[1:01:56] without your grace, your mercy, we would
[1:01:59] not make it. That's right. But because
[1:02:01] grace has provided a way. And for by
[1:02:05] faith are we saved. By
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:09] grace, it is a gift of God. It is not of
[1:02:13] our works, lest any man should boast.
[1:02:17] So, Father, we thank you. We love you
[1:02:20] this morning. We are humbled by your
[1:02:22] presence. I thank you for so many coming
[1:02:25] out this morning, this resurrection
[1:02:28] morning, Sunday, to come and to worship
[1:02:32] together, asking you to take now this
[1:02:36] your word. Anoint it to our
[1:02:38] understanding, Father. For we know it's
[1:02:41] a mystery book. It is not open to
[1:02:44] everyone. Not everyone that reads these
[1:02:46] holy
[1:02:47] scriptures will see the God of the
[1:02:49] scriptures. Not everyone that has
[1:02:52] understanding and goes to seminary and
[1:02:55] maybe study verse with verse. And though
[1:02:58] that be good, but except there come a
[1:03:00] revelation of the Holy Spirit who
[1:03:03] authored that word to come into it and
[1:03:05] quicken it, it remains a dead letter.
[1:03:08] Therefore, Father, may there be a
[1:03:10] quickening power of the Holy Spirit this
[1:03:12] morning coming upon each and everyone,
[1:03:15] Father. Open our eyes of understanding
[1:03:18] that we can see you, Lord. Because when
[1:03:22] we would see Jesus, then all things,
[1:03:26] Father, are made new. Father, I thank
[1:03:28] you. I pray that you will bless each and
[1:03:30] every one that is here now. Father, as I
[1:03:33] yield myself as the best to my knowledge
[1:03:36] and the way that I can to humble myself
[1:03:39] before you, use the gift that you placed
[1:03:43] inside of me knowing it's nothing of
[1:03:46] myself. It's a gift of God. I humble
[1:03:49] myself before you and before your
[1:03:52] people. And I pray use this for the
[1:03:54] glory of thy kingdom. We pray in Jesus
[1:03:57] Christ's
[1:03:58] name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you
[1:04:01] musicians. God bless you. Each and every
[1:04:03] one of you enjoyed the song specials
[1:04:06] today. Praise the Lord. Uh I certainly
[1:04:09] always encourage song specials. I
[1:04:12] believe it helps sets the atmosphere.
[1:04:15] Amen. Turn with me if you would to the
[1:04:16] book of St. John chapter 16. St. John
[1:04:20] chapter 16
[1:04:29] 7-16. St. John
[1:04:32] 16 and verse
[1:04:36] 7. If you're there, say, "Amen." Amen.
[1:04:39] The rest of you, hurry
[1:04:41] up. John 16:7. Nevertheless, I tell you
[1:04:45] the truth, it is expedient for you that
[1:04:48] I go
[1:04:50] away. For if I go not away, the
[1:04:53] comforter will not come unto you. But if
[1:04:56] I depart, I will send him unto you.
[1:05:00] And when he is come,
[1:05:03] he will reprove the world of sin and of
[1:05:06] righteousness and of judgment. Of sin
[1:05:09] because they believe not on me. And of
[1:05:13] righteousness because I go to my father
[1:05:17] and ye see me no more. And of judgment
[1:05:20] because the prince of this world is
[1:05:22] judged.
[1:05:24] I have yet many things to say unto you,
[1:05:26] but seeing you cannot bear them now.
[1:05:30] Somebody say now. Now. So, there was a
[1:05:32] time while Jesus was speaking these
[1:05:34] things that their minds were not
[1:05:37] fruitful in the understanding of what
[1:05:39] God was doing then. Amen. There is an
[1:05:42] appointed time. There is a time. There
[1:05:44] is a season
[1:05:47] in which the word of God is quickened to
[1:05:51] the believer. Yes, sir. That's right. So
[1:05:54] he says
[1:05:55] here uh you cannot bear them
[1:05:59] now. How be it when the spirit of truth
[1:06:03] is come
[1:06:05] he will guide you into all truth for he
[1:06:08] shall not speak of himself
[1:06:11] but he
[1:06:15] speaketh that shall he speak and he
[1:06:18] shall show you things to come. Notice
[1:06:21] when he comes, he's not going to speak
[1:06:23] of himself. He's going to show you. He's
[1:06:26] going to reveal things to you. He's
[1:06:29] going to unveil things that are to come.
[1:06:33] And she he he shall glorify me. For he
[1:06:39] shall receive of mine and shall show it
[1:06:43] unto you. Again, notice he's showing
[1:06:46] things to come. He's going to show it to
[1:06:48] you. Somebody say, "That's me." That's
[1:06:50] amazing. And all those and all the
[1:06:52] things the
[1:06:54] father all things that the father hath
[1:06:58] are mine.
[1:07:00] Therefore said I that he shall take of
[1:07:04] mine and shall show it unto you. A
[1:07:09] little while and ye shall not see me.
[1:07:12] and again a little while and you shall
[1:07:15] see
[1:07:16] me
[1:07:17] because I go to the father. Amen.
[1:07:22] So as we read these
[1:07:24] scriptures, Jesus is making them acutely
[1:07:27] aware. There's coming a
[1:07:30] time that you're going to catch the
[1:07:32] things that I've spoken to you now, but
[1:07:36] it's a delayed reaction. Amen.
[1:07:39] Some of you have to grow in your
[1:07:42] maturity in Christ because when you're a
[1:07:45] child, you think as a child, you speak
[1:07:47] as a child. But when you become a man,
[1:07:49] you put away childish things.
[1:07:53] So, we're speaking of maturity and we're
[1:07:55] talking about that the Lord Jesus is
[1:07:59] preparing them to have a change of
[1:08:02] ministry. Look, I've got to go away.
[1:08:07] I've got to depart. If I don't depart,
[1:08:09] the comforter can't come.
[1:08:12] There cannot be a change of
[1:08:14] administration.
[1:08:16] Do you are you are you catching this in
[1:08:18] scripture? All right. Turn with me now
[1:08:21] to Acts chapter 1.
[1:08:26] Understand that God is just changing his
[1:08:28] mask.
[1:08:30] It's the same God in another vessel.
[1:08:32] Amen.
[1:08:34] the same message just a new
[1:08:37] administration. How many know that today
[1:08:39] is actually called around the world the
[1:08:42] day of
[1:08:43] Pentecost? 50 year 50 days from the time
[1:08:48] of the
[1:08:49] resurrection is Pentecost. So today
[1:08:52] around the world in many other parts of
[1:08:55] the world they celebrate the time of
[1:08:59] Pentecost as much as they do Easter
[1:09:04] and the
[1:09:06] resurrection and all of that. And so
[1:09:09] today
[1:09:11] is a time of Pentecost
[1:09:15] 50 days from the time of the
[1:09:19] resurrection. and watch God's changing
[1:09:23] the
[1:09:25] administration. He said, "I've got to go
[1:09:28] away. And if I don't go away, the
[1:09:31] comforter can't come."
[1:09:33] Now, Jesus had told his disciples, "Not
[1:09:36] many days hence and you shall receive
[1:09:39] power.
[1:09:41] Go into Jerusalem and tarry there
[1:09:45] until See, sometimes God doesn't tell
[1:09:48] you everything. He just says go or to
[1:09:52] terry or whatever because God brings his
[1:09:55] word to pass in season. Amen.
[1:09:59] So Acts chapter
[1:10:03] 1 verse
[1:10:05] one the former treatise have I made. Oh
[1:10:09] theophilos of all that Jesus began both
[1:10:14] to do and to teach. He began. He didn't
[1:10:17] finish it. Amen. Reminding you that the
[1:10:21] Lord Jesus had began a work. But he
[1:10:24] said, "The works that I do shall you do
[1:10:27] also." Amen. Brother Brennham said Jesus
[1:10:31] did not fulfill all of his ministry when
[1:10:35] he was here on earth. But he's left
[1:10:39] it for another portion of himself to
[1:10:44] complete it. Amen. Because she
[1:10:50] She will be him. That's right.
[1:10:54] Do you see? And the final voice was not
[1:10:57] Revelations 10:7.
[1:11:00] That's right.
[1:11:02] Revelations 10:7 was the quickening
[1:11:05] voice to us that heard the mysteries
[1:11:09] being made known. And we begin to catch
[1:11:13] something that we're a part of.
[1:11:16] and it's quickened unto us. But then
[1:11:19] John, take the book.
[1:11:22] I don't want you to just talk about it.
[1:11:23] Take it. Eat it. It's spiritual food in
[1:11:27] due season. And when you when you eat
[1:11:29] it, it assimilates into your body and
[1:11:32] you become a part of it. That's right.
[1:11:34] Where is the book now? In me. What is
[1:11:38] it? It's the word of life.
[1:11:42] Amen.
[1:11:50] He began to do and to teach until the
[1:11:53] day in which he was taken
[1:11:55] up after that he through the Holy Ghost
[1:11:59] had given commandments under the
[1:12:01] apostles whom he had
[1:12:03] chosen. So not everybody's getting it.
[1:12:07] Just to
[1:12:08] the apostles whom he had chosen, to whom
[1:12:12] also he showed himself alive after his
[1:12:16] passion by many infallible proofs, being
[1:12:20] seen of them 40 days, and speaking of
[1:12:23] the things pertaining to the kingdom of
[1:12:25] God. In fact, that is the scripture
[1:12:27] where the prophet of God said, notice,
[1:12:30] he was seen among the disciples by many
[1:12:33] infallible proofs. And so after that
[1:12:36] first resurrection, Christ came and made
[1:12:39] himself known
[1:12:41] only to the elect. Amen.
[1:12:45] He didn't go back to the synagogue.
[1:12:48] Didn't go to
[1:12:49] Caiaphas. He didn't go to anyone else.
[1:12:52] But now he reveals himself.
[1:12:55] I will make known unto you. I will show
[1:12:58] you things to come.
[1:13:00] Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:05] being seen of them 40 days. In fact,
[1:13:07] Brother Bram
[1:13:08] said once the rapture actually takes
[1:13:12] place and the dead in Christ shall rise,
[1:13:15] he said we'll be gathered together here
[1:13:17] on this earth for about 30 to 40 days.
[1:13:21] But the rest of the world isn't going to
[1:13:23] see it. That's right. Amen. That's
[1:13:25] right. Amen. Why will God allow us to
[1:13:29] meet for 30 to 40
[1:13:32] days before we actually ascend up in on
[1:13:36] high or into the clouds in the air to go
[1:13:39] meet him? Because he wants all of your
[1:13:43] attention that when he comes there won't
[1:13:46] anybody of you be rubbernecking and
[1:13:50] being distracted. Oh, did Ron make it?
[1:13:53] Did Robert make it?
[1:13:56] It won't be, "Oh, who's here? Let's
[1:13:59] look." No. All of that's over. Amen.
[1:14:02] We'll have done shook hands. We'll have
[1:14:03] said, "Praise God." We'll have all said,
[1:14:06] "Praise God." Then we're going to go to
[1:14:09] meet him in the air. Hallelujah. All
[1:14:11] right.
[1:14:16] and speaking of the things pertaining to
[1:14:18] the kingdom of God. And being assembled
[1:14:20] together with them, commanded them that
[1:14:24] they should not depart from Jerusalem,
[1:14:26] but wait for the promise of the
[1:14:29] father. What is the promise of the
[1:14:31] father? Holy Spirit. Amen. I want you to
[1:14:35] wait for the promise. For this promise
[1:14:38] is given unto
[1:14:41] you, which saith he, you have heard of
[1:14:44] me. For John truly baptized you with
[1:14:47] water, but ye shall be baptized with the
[1:14:50] Holy Ghost not many days then. So there
[1:14:52] is a baptism of water unto repentance.
[1:14:55] That's okay. That's good. That's a
[1:14:57] beginning.
[1:14:59] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:15:01] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:15:03] and you shall receive another baptism.
[1:15:07] That's right. What is that? That's the
[1:15:09] Holy Ghost.
[1:15:12] So one leads you one's just of water. So
[1:15:14] there are many people can get just
[1:15:16] baptized in water and they go no
[1:15:18] further.
[1:15:22] For John truly baptized with water, but
[1:15:24] ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:15:27] not many days
[1:15:31] then. And when they therefore were come
[1:15:34] together, they asked of him, saying,
[1:15:36] Lord, wilt thou at this time restore
[1:15:38] again the kingdom to
[1:15:41] Israel? A lot of times they're all
[1:15:43] interested on when is this going to be
[1:15:46] fulfilled? When are you going to restore
[1:15:48] the kingdom to
[1:15:49] Israel? because they want to know facts
[1:15:52] and dates and times and understand
[1:15:56] this. Brother Rem said, "Watch. On May
[1:16:00] the 7th,
[1:16:01] 1946, the angel of the Lord came and met
[1:16:04] me in
[1:16:07] Greensville." May the
[1:16:09] 7th, 1946.
[1:16:13] Did you know on May the 7th of
[1:16:19] 2025, the Pope was
[1:16:22] elected and the smoke come out of the
[1:16:25] little chimney on May the 7th. Do you
[1:16:27] think that's a coincidence?
[1:16:31] So, Brother Bram said, "Be careful.
[1:16:33] Watch this. The two of them, it's
[1:16:36] connected together."
[1:16:40] Same day, Israel became a nation. He
[1:16:43] said, "Watch these dispensations are
[1:16:48] overlapping. We're seeing the
[1:16:50] anti-semitism."
[1:16:52] It starts in your
[1:16:55] higher schools of education.
[1:17:01] Why? Because they're eating from the
[1:17:03] tree of knowledge. Knowledge. Amen.
[1:17:06] Not of the tree of life. tree of
[1:17:08] knowledge
[1:17:10] of science
[1:17:12] and education. They're so crazy in their
[1:17:14] mind on
[1:17:16] scientists that even doctors now who are
[1:17:21] medical, they they're supposed to know
[1:17:23] their profession and
[1:17:25] scientists cannot define what is a
[1:17:28] woman,
[1:17:30] what is a man. Well, let me tell you,
[1:17:32] there is a voice in this day that
[1:17:34] defined what is a woman, what is a man,
[1:17:36] and you know your place, and you know
[1:17:38] your position.
[1:17:40] Amen. He told you.
[1:17:43] Amen. He told y'all, I know what a man
[1:17:45] is like. A man
[1:17:48] is going to have this stature. And a
[1:17:50] woman is going to be of this kind of
[1:17:52] stature. And she's going to be a meek
[1:17:55] spirit.
[1:17:57] Chase, keep her at home. Teach her
[1:18:00] children. to love their father. Do you
[1:18:04] see what I'm saying? Listen, it's no
[1:18:07] wonder the world out there, they don't
[1:18:10] they're they're confused
[1:18:13] because the devil is the author of
[1:18:22] confusion. And he said unto them, it is
[1:18:25] not for you to know the times or the
[1:18:27] seasons which the father has put in his
[1:18:30] own power, but ye shall receive power.
[1:18:34] Somebody say power. Power. That word
[1:18:36] means exusia. It means dunamis. It means
[1:18:40] the very where where we get the name
[1:18:42] dynamite. Explosive power. Something
[1:18:45] that's going to move you. But ye shall
[1:18:48] receive power after the Holy Ghost has
[1:18:51] come upon you. And ye shall be witnesses
[1:18:53] unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all
[1:18:56] Judea, and in all Samaria, and in all of
[1:18:59] Surprise, and all into the uttermost
[1:19:01] parts of the earth. Hallelujah. And when
[1:19:05] he had spoken these things, while they
[1:19:08] beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud
[1:19:12] received him out of their sight. And
[1:19:15] while they looked steadfastly towards
[1:19:17] heaven as he went up, behold, two men
[1:19:20] stood by them in white
[1:19:23] apparel, which also said, "Ye men of
[1:19:26] Galilee. Why stand you gazing up into
[1:19:29] heaven? This same Jesus which is taken
[1:19:32] up from you into heaven, he shall come
[1:19:37] in like manner as ye have seen him go
[1:19:41] into heaven." Amen. Amen. And may God
[1:19:45] bless the reading of his word. You all
[1:19:47] may be seated this morning in the
[1:19:49] presence of God.
[1:19:53] Okay. Now, I'm going to try to finish up
[1:19:57] if I can, the Lord willing, on this
[1:20:01] the recognizing of the change of
[1:20:05] administration at the end time. This is
[1:20:07] part five.
[1:20:10] And I want to take a subject this
[1:20:12] morning and all of you because I may
[1:20:13] launch off into this by taking this very
[1:20:17] subject and taking it as a
[1:20:20] sermon. So I want to take you from the
[1:20:23] cross to the
[1:20:27] cloud. From the
[1:20:29] cross to the cloud because this same
[1:20:33] Jesus, you saw him ascend into a
[1:20:37] cloud. Why stand ye gazing?
[1:20:40] Know ye not that when he comes again,
[1:20:43] when he begins to make himself known,
[1:20:45] he's also going to come in a cloud.
[1:20:48] Amen.
[1:20:53] And we are also encompassed about by
[1:20:55] such a cloud of witnesses. Are we
[1:20:58] together now?
[1:21:00] So, I want you to put on your your
[1:21:03] spiritual thinking cap and go beyond
[1:21:06] just sometimes you you have your
[1:21:09] blinders on and you look and you see
[1:21:12] such a little microscopic portion of
[1:21:15] this message. But if you can stand back
[1:21:18] and open your vision and it become an
[1:21:22] overall vision, then you begin to see
[1:21:24] this ministry even of the prophet.
[1:21:30] It opens up before your very wandering
[1:21:34] eyes and then you begin to see, oh wow,
[1:21:37] what God truly has done in this hour.
[1:21:41] He sent a prophet, but why did he send
[1:21:44] him?
[1:21:45] What is it to do? What's that got to do
[1:21:48] with you? Are you a part of it? And and
[1:21:52] so these things here. realm. Let me go
[1:21:54] on to establish something here because
[1:21:56] brother Brennham says that u redemption
[1:22:00] he also says the book of Joshua is the
[1:22:03] book of
[1:22:04] redemption. So there are two parts to
[1:22:08] redemption and brother Brennham says
[1:22:10] this in 1965 the God who is rich in
[1:22:15] mercy. He said mark it down your
[1:22:17] scripture. He said if you would to turn
[1:22:20] to Ephesians. I was speaking last Sunday
[1:22:22] on Ephesians and how that the book of
[1:22:25] Joshua was the Ephesians of the Old
[1:22:28] Testament and how it was a book of
[1:22:31] redemption. So he goes on redemption has
[1:22:34] two
[1:22:35] parts a coming out of and entering into.
[1:22:38] That's why I said you go from Calvary
[1:22:41] first part redemption.
[1:22:44] But without the cloud of entering into
[1:22:47] the ministry of this hour, it's not
[1:22:50] complete.
[1:22:53] We want to enter in. I don't want to
[1:22:55] just talk about this message. I want to
[1:22:57] get into it.
[1:23:02] Some people wants to bring the world in
[1:23:04] with them. But you got to come out of
[1:23:06] the world to enter into Christ. You have
[1:23:10] to come out of unbelief to enter into
[1:23:12] faith. There cannot be one thing in your
[1:23:16] way to really have a genuine faith. You
[1:23:20] must absolutely leave everything that's
[1:23:22] contrary to the word of God behind and
[1:23:25] enter into faith. Amen.
[1:23:29] And now then we find out that we have
[1:23:32] come to another
[1:23:34] Ephesians, another Ephesus now where
[1:23:38] that in our intellectual denominations
[1:23:40] and so forth and all of our educational
[1:23:44] programs has come to its
[1:23:47] Jordan. Then we must have an Ephesians
[1:23:51] again. We must have an exodus to come
[1:23:54] out and to come into for the rapture.
[1:23:57] Amen. Amen. So, we're in another
[1:24:01] Ephesians and we're in another Exodus.
[1:24:06] Now, I want you to all
[1:24:10] understand and I probably will be
[1:24:13] preaching about this here in the very
[1:24:15] near f uh future also. Why are we not a
[1:24:19] denomination?
[1:24:26] Why are we not
[1:24:28] holding hands with everybody else and
[1:24:31] say, you know, hey, when we all get to
[1:24:37] heaven, I want to ask you, what part of
[1:24:39] Jezebel religion do you want a part of?
[1:24:44] What part of the harlot system do you
[1:24:47] embrace? Well, they sing about
[1:24:51] Jesus. They talk about Jesus. They
[1:24:54] preach from their Bible.
[1:24:57] But Paul said they preach another Jesus
[1:25:00] whom we have not preached. Amen. They
[1:25:03] preach you another gospel.
[1:25:06] Paul said if you think yourself to be
[1:25:09] spiritual or a prophet, let him
[1:25:11] acknowledge what what I am saying to be
[1:25:14] the word of God. Amen. Paul said, "Let
[1:25:18] every man take heed how he builds on
[1:25:21] this foundation because I am a wise
[1:25:23] master builder." Imagine a man to be so
[1:25:27] bold to say all of
[1:25:29] this and all of these religions. If a
[1:25:32] man thinks himself to be spiritual, let
[1:25:35] him say amen to what I'm saying is the
[1:25:38] word for this hour.
[1:25:43] You've got to come out of your
[1:25:46] denominational thinking. Amen.
[1:25:52] You've got to come out of all of that
[1:25:54] which you were
[1:25:57] taught and how that you know God is the
[1:26:01] center of the wheel and all of the
[1:26:03] spokes going to the center of the wheel
[1:26:06] and you know one is Lutheran the other's
[1:26:09] Baptist and the other is Pentecostal and
[1:26:12] on and on and we're all going to the
[1:26:14] same place and so let's hold hands and
[1:26:16] sing kumbaya and that we're all going to
[1:26:19] make Did I want you to understand saints
[1:26:23] of God that this is a time that God is
[1:26:26] separating the shuck from the weak sir?
[1:26:29] Amen.
[1:26:37] He said your ignorance now to say that
[1:26:40] you don't know better about the harlot
[1:26:42] system.
[1:26:45] You'll have no excuse. Amen.
[1:26:51] So we are different.
[1:26:55] I'll have you to know we act different.
[1:26:58] We talk different.
[1:27:00] Okay.
[1:27:02] Because we are different. Why? God has
[1:27:05] illuminated to our understanding what
[1:27:08] God is doing in this hour. Thank you
[1:27:10] Lord. You understand?
[1:27:15] Now, in Hebrews 3, let me just lay a
[1:27:19] couple more scriptures here as a
[1:27:21] foundation, then we'll launch off into
[1:27:23] this. Hebrews chapter 3 verse
[1:27:28] 17 through 19. Then Hebrews 4
[1:27:33] 1-2. But with whom was he grieved 40
[1:27:38] years? Was it not with them that had
[1:27:42] sinned? whose carcasses fell in the
[1:27:46] wilderness. To whom swear he that they
[1:27:51] should not enter into his
[1:27:56] rest, but to them that believe
[1:27:59] not. So we see they could not enter in
[1:28:02] because of unbelief. Unbelief's the
[1:28:05] original sin. Amen. It's not lying,
[1:28:08] stealing, cheating, all that stuff.
[1:28:10] Brother R said that's the attributes of
[1:28:11] sin.
[1:28:13] That's why we sing the song only
[1:28:15] believe. Why? Because that's what
[1:28:16] believers do. We believe. We don't
[1:28:19] unbelieve.
[1:28:20] But there are hard times that we through
[1:28:22] our carnal minds and our human
[1:28:26] understanding have a hard time to grasp
[1:28:28] certain things. Therefore, we can pray
[1:28:31] like that one man who prayed, "Lord, I
[1:28:34] believe. Help thou my unbelief." Amen.
[1:28:37] So there are there are times when maybe
[1:28:41] you're not going to understand something
[1:28:42] and you're going to have a hard time and
[1:28:43] you're going to wrestle with it and why
[1:28:46] did God say this? Why is this? And I I
[1:28:49] don't understand. Oh, hang on. Hang on.
[1:28:52] Just pray. Put it on the back shelf. God
[1:28:54] will reveal it to you in due season.
[1:28:56] Yes, he will. Yes, he'll do
[1:29:01] that. Hebrews 4:1. Let us therefore fear
[1:29:04] lest a promise being left us of entering
[1:29:08] into his rest that any of you should
[1:29:11] seem to come short of it. Wouldn't that
[1:29:14] be terrible that have these promises and
[1:29:17] then you come short of it?
[1:29:19] Oh, sorry I'm a day late and a dollar
[1:29:21] short. You ever felt that way? Oh man,
[1:29:24] you should have been here yesterday,
[1:29:26] huh? How much money you got? It takes 10
[1:29:30] bucks. Well, I I only got $8.50. Sorry
[1:29:34] buddy, right? You don't get a
[1:29:37] ticket. So what I'm saying
[1:29:41] is let's look at this these
[1:29:45] promises because the Bible says for unto
[1:29:47] us was the gospel
[1:29:49] preached as well as unto them but the
[1:29:52] word preached did not profit them
[1:29:56] being not mixed with faith in them that
[1:29:59] heard it.
[1:30:00] So you can hear and not have faith mixed
[1:30:03] with it. What is faith? Faith
[1:30:05] revelation.
[1:30:07] So understand with all of your getting,
[1:30:10] get understanding.
[1:30:12] With all of your reading, with all of
[1:30:13] your listening, with all of your going
[1:30:15] to church, I pray that you just don't
[1:30:18] come here and sit on a pew and sit there
[1:30:21] and be void of understanding.
[1:30:25] We're not looking for church members.
[1:30:28] We're looking for bride who's wanting to
[1:30:31] come and enter in and say, "Feed me, man
[1:30:34] of God. Tell me my inheritance. Show me
[1:30:38] the things
[1:30:40] that is for me and for my household."
[1:30:44] Amen. Romans 8:es 19-
[1:30:48] 23. For the earnest expectation of the
[1:30:52] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:30:55] of the sons of God.
[1:30:58] For the creature was made subject to
[1:31:00] vanity, not
[1:31:02] willingly, but by reason of him who hath
[1:31:05] subjected the same in
[1:31:08] hope, because the creature itself also
[1:31:12] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:31:14] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:31:17] the children of God. For we know that
[1:31:19] the whole creation groanth and travaleth
[1:31:23] in pain together until now. Amen.
[1:31:26] Brother Brennan preaches a whole sermon
[1:31:28] on this birth pains.
[1:31:31] He said, "Mother Earth is groaning.
[1:31:37] Is is actually groaning in travail.
[1:31:42] I'm tired of being raped and
[1:31:45] pillaged. My air and water polluted. my
[1:31:48] natural resources. The resources from
[1:31:52] the ground and on and on, everything's
[1:31:54] become so hybrid and
[1:31:57] polluted. Oh, she's
[1:32:01] coughing. Her air and
[1:32:03] everything. So, she's she's under
[1:32:07] travail. Why did we not come from the
[1:32:10] earth?
[1:32:12] Amen.
[1:32:18] And not only they but ourselves
[1:32:21] also which have the first fruits of the
[1:32:24] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:32:27] ourselves waiting for the
[1:32:30] adoption to wit means in other
[1:32:35] words the redemption of our
[1:32:39] body. Now you have the earnest of your
[1:32:42] inheritance right now the earnest.
[1:32:44] You have just a down payment
[1:32:47] which is the Holy Spirit, but you don't
[1:32:49] have all of it. That is the earnest down
[1:32:52] payment, but you've got a greater
[1:32:54] inheritance that is yet to come. And he
[1:32:57] says at the time, when do you get the
[1:33:01] fullness of your redemption? That's a
[1:33:03] change of body. Not now. You can't
[1:33:06] handle it now. Your little
[1:33:09] carnal finite mind can't handle it all.
[1:33:12] So we got to be changed in a moment and
[1:33:14] twinkling of an eye. And when he
[1:33:17] appears, we shall be like him. Amen.
[1:33:20] Hallelujah.
[1:33:21] How that is, I don't know. It's another
[1:33:23] part of the great mystery. I know this
[1:33:25] that if I'm a part of it, I'm there. I
[1:33:28] will know him as he is known. Why? God
[1:33:30] is going to give me an upgrade and all
[1:33:33] of my understanding will become fruitful
[1:33:36] and I won't be thinking carnal like I do
[1:33:38] down here. Praise God. Amen. Amen. I
[1:33:43] look forward to that day. Adoption
[1:33:45] brings the manifestation of the sons of
[1:33:48] God. That's what the whole that's what
[1:33:50] it's all about. That's what this message
[1:33:52] was come to produce. Manifested sons.
[1:33:58] Those who are able to discern the signs
[1:34:00] of the
[1:34:02] times to catch the changing of
[1:34:05] administration. Because if you miss it,
[1:34:08] you are subject to elect captains to
[1:34:10] take you back. Let's choose a captain
[1:34:13] and go back. Or let's choose one like
[1:34:16] Dayan and Cor and say Moses took too
[1:34:18] much unto himself. On and on. You all
[1:34:20] know the scriptures.
[1:34:23] So you must be able to see the change of
[1:34:28] administration because if you leave it
[1:34:30] all with the prophet of
[1:34:34] God, then you've denied the ministry
[1:34:36] that the prophet of God said, "Look,
[1:34:39] there's coming a ministry of the bride."
[1:34:43] Amen. It's what he said. So if you say
[1:34:46] it all stopped with him and you just
[1:34:48] press play, you're denying the word.
[1:34:51] Amen. We don't want to deny the word. We
[1:34:53] want to accept all that he said. Is that
[1:34:56] right? Come on.
[1:35:00] So, you have to be able to catch
[1:35:03] supernatural
[1:35:06] instruction. You have to go beyond man's
[1:35:11] teaching. It's not just being able to
[1:35:13] read your Bible or listen to a tape.
[1:35:15] Because if so, if just reading your
[1:35:17] Bible and listening to a tape was
[1:35:20] enough, then everyone who reads and
[1:35:23] listens to tapes has got it.
[1:35:27] Do you understand? But not everybody
[1:35:30] that reads and listens is going. That's
[1:35:33] right.
[1:35:34] It's those who have the Holy Spirit,
[1:35:37] the token, because without the token,
[1:35:40] you don't have the ticket,
[1:35:44] from Calvary,
[1:35:46] to the cloud. Yes.
[1:35:49] Do you understand? Amen. It's God making
[1:35:52] this message fruitful to our
[1:35:54] understanding. Joshua does not take
[1:35:58] command until after the death of Moses.
[1:36:02] And then we see he comes into command
[1:36:05] after the death of Moses. And the first
[1:36:07] thing he does, he's got to cross over
[1:36:12] Jordan, right? And Jordan is
[1:36:17] overflowed at a time when it looked the
[1:36:19] worst time to cross. I mean, listen,
[1:36:23] saints of God. Sometimes God leads you
[1:36:27] into areas that looks according to
[1:36:31] man a dead end.
[1:36:34] That's what Pharaoh said when Moses took
[1:36:37] him up to the Red Sea. Oh, what a great
[1:36:41] captain they have. We got mountains on
[1:36:43] this side, mountains on that side. We
[1:36:46] got the Red Sea over here and and all of
[1:36:48] my army behind him. Haha, I got him. Let
[1:36:52] me tell you, sometimes God allows you to
[1:36:55] be put into impossible places that
[1:36:59] doesn't look probable to God. But God is
[1:37:01] saying, "Hey, wait.
[1:37:04] Hold on. Stand still and see." Amen. The
[1:37:09] salvation of God. Hallelujah. What is
[1:37:13] impossible to man is probable for God.
[1:37:21] Joshua's was subject to the leadership
[1:37:23] of Moses.
[1:37:26] Amen. Joshua comes to the place of
[1:37:28] adoption when he meets the captain of
[1:37:30] the Lord of hosts. Because now he draws
[1:37:33] his sword. Are you for us or are you
[1:37:34] against us? Watch the sword. It's
[1:37:37] important. He draws his sword to the
[1:37:40] captain of the Lord of hosts and he
[1:37:42] said, "Put up your sword, Josh. I'm the
[1:37:44] captain of the Lord of hosts."
[1:37:47] And so now Joshua is being
[1:37:51] commissioned to take your sword, not
[1:37:53] fight against me, but take it and
[1:37:56] position Israel into the place where
[1:37:58] they need to be. Amen.
[1:38:01] Okay. What has this message done for
[1:38:04] you? Has it placed you into a position
[1:38:08] taking you from here
[1:38:11] into here? Thank you, Lord. God help us
[1:38:15] understand what has this message done to
[1:38:18] you? Have we have we just made it rules
[1:38:22] and regulations and it's a long dress
[1:38:24] and long hair and it's a form of
[1:38:29] religion. Because if we're not careful,
[1:38:31] that's what we do. We just make it a a
[1:38:35] religion. God help us.
[1:38:39] You see, when the angel of the Lord met
[1:38:41] the prophet on the mountain, because
[1:38:43] he's asking God, "Is my ministry over?
[1:38:47] Are you taking me off the scene? What
[1:38:49] are you doing? Nobody can live through
[1:38:51] an explosion like that?" And he said,
[1:38:53] "There, I'm praying. I'm asking God that
[1:38:57] he'll help me understand the vision,
[1:38:59] this the all of this that's
[1:39:02] happening." And he said, "A sword hit my
[1:39:04] hand.
[1:39:07] Now understand what he's doing. He's
[1:39:09] coming to his commission.
[1:39:12] All the times before when he's talking
[1:39:14] about the third pull, the third pull,
[1:39:16] watch, when it comes, there'll be a
[1:39:17] change in my ministry. You all know the
[1:39:19] first been identified. The second's been
[1:39:22] identified. I can't hold on to the first
[1:39:24] and second or the third can't come. You
[1:39:26] all know the scriptures or or the quotes
[1:39:29] there of the angel of the Lord to the
[1:39:31] prophet. But now, watch this. It's very
[1:39:34] important. You catch this.
[1:39:36] said, "This is the third pope. You have
[1:39:39] entered into it.
[1:39:42] The ministry has
[1:39:43] changed. I'm turning a corner.
[1:39:47] I'm not going back into world
[1:39:49] evangelism. It's not for them out
[1:39:51] there." Amen.
[1:39:54] Don't try to teach Pentecostal babies
[1:39:57] supernatural thing. Don't get your lion
[1:39:59] all tangled up in times like these.
[1:40:02] That's right. Quit trying to tell them
[1:40:04] how to catch fish.
[1:40:06] Sh. Because if they don't catch it,
[1:40:09] they're not going to catch it.
[1:40:12] Amen. But if they're bright,
[1:40:16] hallelujah, you can't help but catch it.
[1:40:19] That's right. Why? He will show you
[1:40:23] things to come.
[1:40:25] That's why when a preacher says, "Well,
[1:40:27] I'll tell you what. You got to follow me
[1:40:28] in what I say in this. And I'm the
[1:40:31] Joshua of this hour. Listen, there is no
[1:40:34] man who is the man, the Joshua of the
[1:40:38] hour. There is no Joshua church that you
[1:40:41] got to be in that church or you're not
[1:40:43] going to make it. There is not going to
[1:40:45] be one little group that's no. Let me
[1:40:48] tell you, God's got a universal group
[1:40:51] around the world. This message is far
[1:40:54] greater. Amen. than Surprise Arizona.
[1:40:57] That's right.
[1:40:59] Preach it. Much bigger. We're just a
[1:41:03] little microcosm.
[1:41:08] If I could take a snippet case of your
[1:41:12] DNA and I come up there and I'm a
[1:41:15] scientist, so I just come up here and
[1:41:16] take a little snippet. Maybe I take
[1:41:19] just, you know, come up here and little
[1:41:21] bit of your skin and I decide I want to
[1:41:24] duplicate
[1:41:26] you. Your DNA is so unique to you. But
[1:41:29] if I took it and multiplied it, guess
[1:41:31] what? I'd have an identical you.
[1:41:36] You understand it?
[1:41:39] Because your DNA is so unique. It's just
[1:41:41] like your fingerprint and everything
[1:41:43] about you. Your spirit is unique. Your
[1:41:46] facial Recognition is unique anymore.
[1:41:50] You go to get on your I I fly Delta. So
[1:41:54] you go up there. It used to be you show
[1:41:56] your passport. You had to have your
[1:41:58] ticket in your hand. They just stand
[1:41:59] there. Just stand here and look and look
[1:42:01] here. Yeah. Okay. Mr. Peterson, go get
[1:42:04] on the plane. What? You don't want to
[1:42:06] see my pass right? No. We got
[1:42:07] everything. All they do facial
[1:42:10] recognition. You know what God's doing
[1:42:12] with the bride right now? Just come.
[1:42:13] Just stand right here. Get in your
[1:42:15] position. Yeah. Amen. Get in.
[1:42:19] You see what it is? It's that picture he
[1:42:21] took of you before the foundation of the
[1:42:24] world. That's you. Yeah.
[1:42:27] Enter in. Hallelujah. You begin to see
[1:42:30] God does everything through a
[1:42:32] recognition.
[1:42:34] I know you. You were a part of me. Yeah.
[1:42:37] You, Job. Where were you?
[1:42:44] I was in him. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:52] Actually, Joshua, the Bible says, was
[1:42:55] called Moses minister.
[1:42:59] I like
[1:43:02] that. So, now understand when, and
[1:43:05] excuse me if I slur a little bit, you
[1:43:09] understand. I bit my tongue
[1:43:13] yesterday. Any of you ever done that? Uh
[1:43:16] uh uh. My wife goes, "What's my uh uh
[1:43:19] uh bit my tongue? It's all swollen on
[1:43:22] the right
[1:43:24] side." So if I lift a little bit, you'll
[1:43:28] understand. I don't mean to be funny.
[1:43:30] It's the truth. It
[1:43:34] hurts. I want to call up some of these
[1:43:37] brothers. Brother Mario, come on. I bit
[1:43:40] my
[1:43:41] tongue.
[1:43:43] Preach. Anyway, so if I lisp or
[1:43:48] whatever, you'll you'll forgive me.
[1:43:50] Amen. In the sermon adoption, watch
[1:43:54] this. Our Ephesians, our
[1:43:57] Joshua, which is the Holy Spirit, our
[1:44:01] Joshua, which is the Holy Spirit. Joshua
[1:44:05] means Jesus savior.
[1:44:08] Joshua means that the Holy Spirit
[1:44:11] represents it in the spiritual as it was
[1:44:14] in the natural. That he is our great
[1:44:17] warrior.
[1:44:19] He's our great leader. And God was with
[1:44:22] Joshua. And so God in the Holy
[1:44:25] Spirit moves us about. Amen. Oh, I can't
[1:44:32] Oh, can't you
[1:44:34] see how we got too many sons of Kishna?
[1:44:37] Too many souls coming out from
[1:44:40] seminaries, theological schools, going
[1:44:42] out teaching this perverse things as the
[1:44:44] Bible said they would do, seemingly not
[1:44:47] having the faith, separating themselves
[1:44:49] from you, having no fellowship with you,
[1:44:52] and so forth, having a form of
[1:44:54] godliness, denying the power thereof,
[1:44:56] from such turn away. They don't know
[1:44:58] where they come from. They can't give a
[1:45:00] reason. Listen and understand that this
[1:45:03] ministry of the prophet of God and the
[1:45:07] ministry of Joshua, it's not a man.
[1:45:11] It's the Holy Spirit himself. Amen.
[1:45:15] He's our savior. He's our great warrior.
[1:45:18] So, it's not a man. It's not a special
[1:45:22] church. Now, watch this. Because without
[1:45:25] faith, it's impossible
[1:45:27] to please God. Amen.
[1:45:32] And I said this the other day and my
[1:45:34] wife reminded me, "Honey, you said the
[1:45:37] first part but didn't finish it." I
[1:45:39] began to ask all of you a question,
[1:45:41] spiritual, biblical trivia. How long did
[1:45:44] the ministry of Jesus Christ last from
[1:45:46] the time he took the scroll and he said,
[1:45:48] "This day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:45:50] until he's crucified?"
[1:45:53] Three and a half
[1:45:54] years. Okay, you understand? So now the
[1:45:59] prophet we want to look at the Christ in
[1:46:02] our day. You understand? And I believe
[1:46:06] listen saints of God I don't want you to
[1:46:09] misunderstand me that the ministry of uh
[1:46:14] tapes that he put prior to 63 with the
[1:46:18] opening of the seals are still very
[1:46:20] important.
[1:46:22] So we don't do away with those. But a
[1:46:25] prophetic
[1:46:27] ministry, go look from the time of 65,
[1:46:30] count backwards, three and a half years.
[1:46:33] That's right.
[1:46:36] Say it.
[1:46:38] Taking sides with Jesus. Right. And
[1:46:42] brother Brennham said, "This is where
[1:46:44] I've always had the problem. I've mixed
[1:46:47] evangelism
[1:46:49] with a prophetic gift." Amen. But now,
[1:46:52] wait a second. I thought he always took
[1:46:53] sides with
[1:46:54] Jesus. Understand now he says, "Look, a
[1:46:57] prophet doesn't mix up this gift of
[1:47:00] world
[1:47:01] evangelism. Come out here and and
[1:47:04] evangelize and everything." He says,
[1:47:06] "You know, telling these people their
[1:47:08] name, where they're from, what good is
[1:47:09] it done?"
[1:47:12] Your name is so and so. You're from Yes.
[1:47:15] Yes.
[1:47:18] But did they go on to follow the
[1:47:20] message?
[1:47:24] So all of the first and second pull, God
[1:47:27] just them is an attraction. Amen. Well,
[1:47:30] no man can do these things except God be
[1:47:33] with him. Like Nicodemus, we know that
[1:47:35] word a man come from God. They wrote
[1:47:38] books. A man sent from God. They began
[1:47:40] to uh uh uh they began to tape his
[1:47:44] ministry.
[1:47:47] Okay? because they realize, wow,
[1:47:50] something very important. This this is a
[1:47:53] unique ministry. Let's tape it.
[1:47:58] Yes. Amen.
[1:48:01] Because it was so unique.
[1:48:06] See, he So, three and a half years, if
[1:48:08] you take it from 1965, that's when he
[1:48:11] goes off the scene, and take it back
[1:48:14] three and a half years, you have a
[1:48:15] prophetic ministry.
[1:48:18] And you will find then he's now a
[1:48:22] prophet saying, "I'm not going back and
[1:48:24] doing those things." If you can catch
[1:48:26] it, this is that third pull. Amen. This
[1:48:29] is what I've been telling you. A change
[1:48:31] in my ministry. I've told you for years.
[1:48:33] It's coming. Haven't you understood?
[1:48:36] This is that third pull. I'm in it right
[1:48:39] now. It's here. It's been identified.
[1:48:41] Why can't you catch it? Because
[1:48:44] sometimes people all they do is get
[1:48:45] caught up in the signs and the wonders
[1:48:48] and and all of the miracles and fishes
[1:48:50] and loaves. Listen, let's go beyond
[1:48:52] fishes and loaves. Amen. Let's go into
[1:48:55] the word revealed because that's what's
[1:48:57] going to get you out of here. The word
[1:49:00] revealed in its season. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:08] So in a sermon
[1:49:11] 63, looking look away to
[1:49:14] Jesus. I'm going to say something to you
[1:49:16] now that I haven't said all along. That
[1:49:19] is the thing that we've looked forward
[1:49:21] to for so long or at least many years,
[1:49:24] four or five years, maybe longer. The
[1:49:25] third pole has now been vindicated. I'm
[1:49:28] sure you all know what it is.
[1:49:32] I'm sure you all know what it is. Now,
[1:49:35] listen. I want to
[1:49:36] say
[1:49:38] that our young people, they had at
[1:49:42] camp, they had a time when I I think uh
[1:49:47] they had a
[1:49:50] Jeopardy and
[1:49:51] Elias and Andy Paul dressed up. Yeah,
[1:49:56] you should see their costume. They're
[1:49:57] amazing, you guys.
[1:50:00] And so they did they had jeopardy where
[1:50:02] you you have the answer so what is the
[1:50:05] question right whatever. So they had
[1:50:08] simple ones. So the
[1:50:12] ministry of this angel messenger in
[1:50:16] louda fulfilled what
[1:50:21] scripture? And all the kids stood
[1:50:28] there. Let me think. Give me a
[1:50:33] hint. Is it somewhere in the scripture?
[1:50:37] Oh, give
[1:50:38] me a
[1:50:41] break. Listen, if you young people don't
[1:50:44] know by now,
[1:50:46] the major scriptures we use all the
[1:50:48] time. In fact, brother Brandham says it
[1:50:50] on almost every sermon. watch in the
[1:50:53] days of Malachi 4, of Revelations 10, of
[1:50:57] Luke 17, and you sit there like a cow
[1:51:00] looking at a new gate,
[1:51:05] and you don't know where are you?
[1:51:09] Where were you in the time of Sunday
[1:51:11] school? That's right. Where were you in
[1:51:14] all these sermons?
[1:51:16] Are you sitting there and the lights are
[1:51:18] on and nobody's home?
[1:51:24] Yes, that's embarrassing.
[1:51:29] So, our youth
[1:51:33] leadership
[1:51:35] 101 and help you to understand. Hey,
[1:51:38] listen. What is this message all about?
[1:51:43] Now
[1:51:45] watch. He says, "I warn I was warned of
[1:51:49] this that soon, right at this time now,
[1:51:52] it's just happened, so it could identify
[1:51:55] its presence among you, but it will not
[1:51:58] be used in a great way until the council
[1:52:00] begins to tighten up. And when it does,
[1:52:04] and the Pentecostals and so forth can
[1:52:07] impersonate, anything could be done. But
[1:52:09] when that time comes, when the squeeze
[1:52:13] comes down, then you'll see what you've
[1:52:15] seen temporarily.
[1:52:17] Be manifested in the fullness of its
[1:52:20] power.
[1:52:22] Amen. He says you've seen it
[1:52:25] temporarily. You all know what it is.
[1:52:27] It's the word. It's been
[1:52:30] identified. Now, just to the highlighted
[1:52:33] portion, I'm sorry, don't go back and
[1:52:35] read these quotes yourself. And by the
[1:52:38] way, we have it on our website. So you
[1:52:40] can go look at our sermon. And next to
[1:52:42] the sermon are the quotes. All of the
[1:52:44] quotes and scriptures that we use. So if
[1:52:47] you miss it by not writing it down, you
[1:52:50] have no excuse. You can go back and read
[1:52:51] it yourself. Why do I put this stuff up
[1:52:57] here? Because I want you to see what he
[1:53:00] said. That's right. This isn't just me
[1:53:03] saying it. He said it. Amen. He said,
[1:53:05] "Say what I say on those tapes." So,
[1:53:08] here's what he said on tape. And
[1:53:10] everyone knows that for a certain as the
[1:53:12] first was identified, so has the second
[1:53:14] been identified. And if you'll think
[1:53:16] real closely, you who are spiritual, as
[1:53:20] the Bible said, to him who hath wisdom,
[1:53:23] the third is properly identified, you
[1:53:26] know. So, the third pull is here. Amen.
[1:53:34] Now, let me declare something to you
[1:53:36] right
[1:53:37] now because I believe we have entered
[1:53:41] into a season now where the bride is
[1:53:46] catching it.
[1:53:48] I declare unto you,
[1:53:51] it's here. Amen. It's now. It's going on
[1:53:56] around the world. It's not just in our
[1:53:58] church.
[1:54:00] I cannot say we are the exclusive. If
[1:54:04] you are not a part of our group, if you
[1:54:06] don't listen to my website, if you don't
[1:54:08] follow my ministry, you're out. Oh,
[1:54:10] nonsense. Those are false prophets.
[1:54:14] Those are the beaver preachers.
[1:54:18] Brother Bram, look it up. He only says
[1:54:19] it one time. He said beaver preachers.
[1:54:22] He said they dam it up. They say it's us
[1:54:24] four and no more.
[1:54:27] The exclusivity of this message is to
[1:54:31] the Holy Ghost bride
[1:54:34] who are under the Joshua ministry. Who's
[1:54:37] Joshua?
[1:54:39] The Holy Spirit. So without the Holy
[1:54:42] Spirit, even foolish
[1:54:44] Virgin sits right there and doesn't
[1:54:46] really have a real clue of what's going
[1:54:49] on. That's why listen, you've got to
[1:54:52] have the Holy Spirit without the token.
[1:54:54] Brother Bram said, "Watch." He said, "If
[1:54:57] I ever had a sermon that is the capstone
[1:55:00] of my of my ministry, what is it?" The
[1:55:03] token.
[1:55:13] The Holy Ghost is here to lead you and
[1:55:15] guide you into all truth.
[1:55:17] The third pull is the revealing of the
[1:55:20] word of the hour in
[1:55:22] season. Sirs, is this the sign of the
[1:55:26] end? Is this the time, sir?
[1:55:30] So, he's asking the question, what is
[1:55:32] this attraction?
[1:55:35] Who do you say this is?
[1:55:39] He begins, he wants you to find the
[1:55:41] answer. Amen. It's not something that
[1:55:43] your pastor teaches you.
[1:55:46] It's not something
[1:55:50] that the ministry teaches
[1:55:53] you. They preach it, but who teaches
[1:55:55] you?
[1:56:01] The Holy Spirit. Without the Holy
[1:56:02] Spirit, you sit there. Uh
[1:56:06] uh. Hang on. Hang on. Do you know an
[1:56:09] open book test? Any of you that went to
[1:56:11] the
[1:56:12] university and your college professor
[1:56:14] said, "I'm not taking role." I don't
[1:56:16] care if you come to class. I don't care.
[1:56:19] You're paying to go to
[1:56:20] school, right? It's none. Is Ron
[1:56:23] Peterson here? Say yes. Yeah. Like this.
[1:56:26] In college, they don't care. Bell rings.
[1:56:29] Get out your notebook. We're on page
[1:56:32] 263. And we're going to start here. And
[1:56:34] your professor goes up and down. He
[1:56:36] said, "Take lots of notes." In fact,
[1:56:38] when we have the exam at the end of the
[1:56:40] course, it's an open book exam. You can
[1:56:43] bring your books, you can bring your
[1:56:45] notes and everything because my test is
[1:56:47] going to be so
[1:56:50] hard, open book test. I want you to
[1:56:53] understand this is an open book message.
[1:56:56] That's all there
[1:56:59] to get into it because it's not just,
[1:57:03] you know, well, yeah, I read it once.
[1:57:05] Uh, let me see. I think it was the seven
[1:57:07] churches. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, seven
[1:57:08] churches. Uh, uh, no, no, no, it was the
[1:57:11] seven seals. Okay. Uh, uh, hold on. Hold
[1:57:16] on. I'm not
[1:57:18] done. I had the answers, but it's
[1:57:21] terrible because you're sitting there
[1:57:22] and you you kind of somewhat know the
[1:57:25] answer, but you don't know where it's
[1:57:26] at. The message has got to be in you.
[1:57:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:57:35] See, we
[1:57:37] ministers, you ministers here within
[1:57:40] this church, understand you should be
[1:57:42] able to just take your
[1:57:44] Bible and go and start
[1:57:47] preaching and quote from the message of
[1:57:50] the hour. Why? Because it's in you.
[1:57:54] Why? It's revelation. You catch it. You
[1:57:57] begin to understand. And those that have
[1:58:00] been catching the understanding at home
[1:58:03] in your prayer closet in you having a
[1:58:06] relationship with God that when he drops
[1:58:08] into that channel, you go, "Amen."
[1:58:11] That's true.
[1:58:13] Why? He revealed it to me also. Amen.
[1:58:17] All
[1:58:18] right.
[1:58:20] So, I'm declaring to you, it's here.
[1:58:25] We're in it. Don't wait for it. We're in
[1:58:28] it. Amen. So understand, start praying
[1:58:30] for the revelation that you're to catch
[1:58:34] of the message of the hour in its
[1:58:36] season. Amen. Now understand, let me let
[1:58:40] me say this so you can kind of follow
[1:58:42] along this understanding. years
[1:58:45] ago, 30 and 40 years ago in this message
[1:58:49] when we began to just catch the fact
[1:58:52] that God sent a prophet messenger when
[1:58:55] we had
[1:58:58] meetings. Well, brother Brian Yesi, we
[1:59:01] used to travel across from Arizona to
[1:59:04] Arkansas to have meetings and they said,
[1:59:06] "Hallelujah, God sent a prophet."
[1:59:09] Revelations 10. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:59:13] You know that, Bobby? Everybody started
[1:59:16] glorifying the fact God sent a
[1:59:18] messenger. Hallelujah. The voice of
[1:59:20] Revelations 10:7. The messenger. The
[1:59:23] messenger. Hallelujah. The messenger.
[1:59:25] And we got it. We got it. Yes. Now, I
[1:59:29] can say that to you now and you none of
[1:59:31] you stand up. Amen. Glory to God. No.
[1:59:33] No. Okay. I understand. God sent the
[1:59:35] messenger, but what about his message?
[1:59:40] See, it has moved from the season of
[1:59:43] catching who the messenger is to who the
[1:59:47] message is.
[1:59:49] Because the message is Christ. Amen.
[1:59:55] The message is Christ. If you miss that,
[1:59:59] then you have really no idea what this
[2:00:01] message is all about. Then you put it
[2:00:04] according to your understanding. And if
[2:00:07] we're not careful, we preach a closline
[2:00:09] religion and we say you're a message
[2:00:12] believer. Why? Because of the way you
[2:00:14] dress.
[2:00:17] Now, thank God that you
[2:00:19] dress properly.
[2:00:23] But some of you dress that way only
[2:00:25] because of pressure.
[2:00:30] That's all. You're conformed.
[2:00:33] you conform to it rather than be you
[2:00:35] transformed
[2:00:37] because how many do you know now
[2:00:40] unfortunately I I say I know more than I
[2:00:44] want to know that for years said they
[2:00:47] believed this was the message hour he
[2:00:50] was the prophet of the hour
[2:00:52] etc and they followed the message
[2:00:56] through the way they dressed and after
[2:00:59] 30 years they gave it
[2:01:02] I want to ask you, was it revelation?
[2:01:05] No, it was head knowledge. Amen.
[2:01:08] And they couldn't fit it into their
[2:01:11] understanding. So therefore, what
[2:01:13] happens? Now, watch. Here's another
[2:01:15] thing I want all of you to
[2:01:17] understand that a feel-good religion,
[2:01:21] Jezebel religion, will let you live any
[2:01:24] kind of life you want to. You sisters,
[2:01:27] you want to cut your
[2:01:29] hair? Yeah. You want it to look like
[2:01:32] mine? Go
[2:01:34] ahead. Shave it off. You want to wear
[2:01:38] pants, trousers, you young boys, you
[2:01:40] want to wear
[2:01:42] shorts. You want to go out here, you
[2:01:44] want to do all these, go ahead, man.
[2:01:46] It's legalism. That's what this message
[2:01:48] is. It's legalism. You're only doing it
[2:01:51] because it's the law.
[2:01:54] I want to ask you, is it law or love?
[2:01:55] Amen. Jesus said, "If you love me, you
[2:01:58] do what? Keep my commandments." So, you
[2:02:02] got to fall in love with him because if
[2:02:04] you don't, you conform to it for a
[2:02:08] certain while, but when the pressure
[2:02:10] gets too great, you throw it out. And
[2:02:12] then all of a sudden, you say, "Well,
[2:02:14] I'm free. I'm free now. Oh, I feel so
[2:02:17] good. And I go to these denominational
[2:02:20] churches and I
[2:02:23] can they don't care if I cut my hair,
[2:02:26] wear my makeup, if I drink, if I cuss.
[2:02:28] It's okay when we all get to
[2:02:32] heaven. What a day of rejoicing. Oh yes.
[2:02:35] Yes.
[2:02:37] Yes. It's Cain's religion. Amen.
[2:02:43] You think God receives every sacrifice?
[2:02:48] Everybody stand up for a minute. Stand
[2:02:51] up.
[2:02:52] Too many of you are sleeping.
[2:02:56] Put your hands up.
[2:02:59] All right. Go ahead and sit
[2:03:02] down. Little spiritual calisthenics
[2:03:04] because I don't know what you've been
[2:03:06] doing all day yesterday, but
[2:03:09] you So, help me out here. I'll just give
[2:03:12] you a couple more minutes and let me see
[2:03:15] here.
[2:03:19] Man, understand, saints of
[2:03:22] God, it is on my heart as a pastor of
[2:03:25] this end
[2:03:26] time that I provoke every one of you
[2:03:29] unto good works. Amen. I'm not here to
[2:03:32] just give you a 45 minute
[2:03:34] sermon and say, "Okay, hey, little this
[2:03:37] and that. We sing a song and after 45
[2:03:40] minutes, good. We can go." and everybody
[2:03:42] go home and and and you know we can
[2:03:44] rest.
[2:03:48] Yeah. Well, Sunday is the day of rest
[2:03:49] and I want to rest. Well, some of you
[2:03:52] work so hard throughout the week and
[2:03:53] then you do your thing on Saturday that
[2:03:57] you want to stay home on Sunday because
[2:04:00] I need some rest.
[2:04:07] If you didn't party so much and do so
[2:04:10] much Monday through
[2:04:14] Saturday, you could persevere a little
[2:04:16] bit longer on Sunday. And you'd be
[2:04:20] thankful for it.
[2:04:24] And then that's true after the pastor
[2:04:26] lets you out and you sing, "Take the
[2:04:28] name of Jesus with you." And there's a
[2:04:31] quick resurrection within the church and
[2:04:33] everybody wakes up and oh good now we
[2:04:36] can go. Oh, I'm thinking about lunch.
[2:04:38] I'm thinking about my friends. Thinking
[2:04:40] about And then you all of a sudden, you
[2:04:41] know, most of you don't go home and go
[2:04:43] to sleep.
[2:04:46] Amen.
[2:04:49] Let's do something.
[2:04:52] Well, can we not redeem the time here
[2:04:54] right now?
[2:04:56] Cannot we take a little bit longer time
[2:04:59] because listen, the only time that we
[2:05:02] have with you compared to the whole rest
[2:05:05] of the week,
[2:05:07] your jobs got you,
[2:05:10] your school's got you,
[2:05:12] everything is taking up your time, your
[2:05:15] kids, your
[2:05:17] husband, all of this stuff, the cares of
[2:05:21] life. I don't have no time. I'm just so
[2:05:27] frazzled. The Bible says, "And some weed
[2:05:31] springs up quickly." And because the
[2:05:34] cares of
[2:05:36] life
[2:05:39] show the weed,
[2:05:41] it becomes unfruitful.
[2:05:45] It didn't say sin.
[2:05:48] The cares of life. What are some of the
[2:05:50] cares of life? What you'll eat.
[2:05:52] I mean, some of us are so obsessed.
[2:05:57] I
[2:05:59] am. I ask my wife, "What's for lunch?" I
[2:06:03] can be just finishing up lunch and I'm
[2:06:05] asking, "What's for dinner?" "What's
[2:06:08] wrong with you?" "It's a man thing." It
[2:06:11] is. It's a man
[2:06:15] thing. She My wife asked me all the
[2:06:17] time, "How are you?" I said, "I'm
[2:06:20] hangry.
[2:06:22] That's angry and h and hungry together.
[2:06:25] So I'm
[2:06:26] hangry. So you you want to just make me
[2:06:29] happy? Feed me. Okay. And then I like a
[2:06:35] lion. My belly is
[2:06:37] round. I'm full. And then I impala can
[2:06:41] run right by
[2:06:48] me. I've seen it.
[2:06:57] Now, musicians, if you come, I'm I'm I'm
[2:07:00] going to bring this to a
[2:07:02] close. I've gone far enough today.
[2:07:06] Amen. Preach.
[2:07:11] I preach.
[2:07:19] Thank you.
[2:07:21] I see. I'll go a little. You musicians,
[2:07:23] you wait. Yeah, Justin
[2:07:27] Justin was already up there. I'm coming.
[2:07:33] Hang on.
[2:07:39] Sermon manifested sons of God.
[2:07:44] Then did you notice Moses, that great
[2:07:47] miracle
[2:07:48] performer, brought them down down,
[2:07:51] Israel down to that land and brought
[2:07:54] them up to the promised land, but they
[2:07:56] did not place them their inheritance to
[2:07:59] them. He did not give them their
[2:08:01] inheritance. He led them up to the land,
[2:08:03] but Joshua divided the land to the
[2:08:05] people. Is that right? But the Holy
[2:08:08] Spirit is the one who sets the church in
[2:08:09] order.
[2:08:12] The Holy Spirit,
[2:08:17] the Joshua of today puts the church in
[2:08:20] order, giving to each one
[2:08:24] gifts, places, and position. And he is
[2:08:28] the voice of God speaking to the inner
[2:08:31] man that Christ has saved the Holy
[2:08:34] Spirit.
[2:08:36] He's positioning, placing the church
[2:08:38] where they belong. Now Joshua placed
[2:08:40] them in the natural land. Now the Holy
[2:08:43] Spirit is placing the church
[2:08:46] positionally in the land in the position
[2:08:48] that they belong in their inheritance.
[2:08:54] God is calling right now for a total
[2:08:56] separation from unbelief.
[2:09:00] If they did not cross
[2:09:02] over and inherit the promises of God
[2:09:06] because of their unbelief, because what
[2:09:09] they heard was not mixed in faith, do
[2:09:11] you think God's going to excuse us? No.
[2:09:15] You think that God is just going to give
[2:09:17] you all
[2:09:19] uh you can go ahead and pass go, but
[2:09:22] collect $200, whatever. This is not
[2:09:26] monopoly. That's right.
[2:09:33] This
[2:09:35] is the final test. That's right.
[2:09:40] It's happening right
[2:09:46] now. Perfect faith.
[2:09:49] 1963. Watch what the prophet
[2:09:51] says. This is coming into that third
[2:09:55] pole. I'm believing it.
[2:09:58] I want to ask you a sincere
[2:10:00] question. You that passed through the
[2:10:02] prayer line, can you actually believe
[2:10:03] and feel now that there is something
[2:10:06] happened? And since you since you've had
[2:10:09] hands laid on you, raise your hand as
[2:10:11] there it is. This is what we've talked
[2:10:14] for, waited for. Excuse me. This is just
[2:10:18] starting to bloom now.
[2:10:20] Just starting to bloom. Do you know when
[2:10:22] something starts to bloom, it's starting
[2:10:24] to come to its fruition? Yes. Amen.
[2:10:28] I did this for a purpose. I'm working
[2:10:30] out something. It's taking this charge
[2:10:33] of faith and going back to begin and
[2:10:35] come in to kind of raise faith into a
[2:10:38] bracket where you never noticed in that
[2:10:41] way before. Not a faith, but a perfect
[2:10:44] faith
[2:10:46] built up in here. And watch a perfect
[2:10:48] God with a perfect heart, keeping a
[2:10:52] perfect promise by his perfect word,
[2:10:54] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[2:10:57] and a discerner of the thoughts of the
[2:10:59] heart. What we're coming now to
[2:11:02] perfection
[2:11:04] because the people has to come to this
[2:11:07] in order for the rapture.
[2:11:13] Amen. That's what's holding it away
[2:11:15] right now is waiting for that church to
[2:11:19] come into that perfect raptured faith.
[2:11:22] I'm looking for it. Means a whole lot of
[2:11:26] shaking down for me. It means a whole
[2:11:29] lot for you, but together we'll make it
[2:11:32] by the grace of God.
[2:11:36] Yes, sir.
[2:11:40] Means a whole lot of shaking down.
[2:11:47] It's happening.
[2:11:51] Shucks not air with the wheat.
[2:11:54] The fan is in his
[2:11:59] hand. It's harvest time. This is Boaz.
[2:12:04] He's at the threshing floor. And Ruth
[2:12:07] came to her position because she was
[2:12:10] told by Naomi, that's right.
[2:12:13] go and lay your yourself at his feet cuz
[2:12:16] feet are possession.
[2:12:18] Amen.
[2:12:21] And she through the
[2:12:23] instruction is led to go and to and here
[2:12:27] is where well where do I find him? Is he
[2:12:29] out in the field? No. Where is he? He's
[2:12:32] at the threshing floor and the fan is in
[2:12:36] his hand.
[2:12:41] It's a turbulent time
[2:12:45] tossed about by every wind of doctrine.
[2:12:50] You don't have revelation. Guess what?
[2:12:52] You're going to get blown away.
[2:12:58] Here he is,
[2:13:00] Boaz. He
[2:13:02] looks, who art
[2:13:04] thou, you that lay at my feet?
[2:13:09] Who are you? Identify yourself.
[2:13:13] I am thy handmade.
[2:13:17] She's already identifying. I'm part of
[2:13:19] you. Amen. I am thy handmade.
[2:13:28] He doesn't chase her off.
[2:13:31] He says, "You stay here
[2:13:34] until I do the work of the kinsman
[2:13:36] redeemer.
[2:13:38] That's right.
[2:13:42] Stay here until the rising
[2:13:46] of the sun.
[2:13:58] Ruth had been working,
[2:14:01] but now she's in her position. You know
[2:14:04] what she's doing? Resting.
[2:14:08] Brother Brennham saw the bride across
[2:14:11] the chasm beyond the curtain of time.
[2:14:15] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You You're too smart.
[2:14:19] They said we're resting on it.
[2:14:22] Listen, the bride right now, we're not
[2:14:24] looking for a eighth messenger. We're
[2:14:27] not looking for another prophet. Our
[2:14:28] prophet has come. He's come. He's
[2:14:32] sounded his voice.
[2:14:34] Amen. There's been one prophet
[2:14:36] messenger. We're not looking for another
[2:14:38] one. Because unless you have the
[2:14:41] revelation that that one prophet has
[2:14:43] come, you'll be looking for another one.
[2:14:45] Where is he? Who is it going to be? Is
[2:14:48] he in Africa? Is he in Asia? Is he here
[2:14:51] in the United States?
[2:15:00] In numbers 27, let me take this a little
[2:15:04] further. Numbers
[2:15:07] 27:18-23. And the Lord spake said unto
[2:15:10] Moses, "Take the Joshua the son of Nun,
[2:15:12] a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thy
[2:15:15] hand upon him. Set him before Elijah the
[2:15:18] priest, and before all the congregation,
[2:15:20] give him a charge in thy sight.
[2:15:23] Thou shalt put some of thine honor upon
[2:15:26] him, that all the congregation, the
[2:15:28] children of Israel, may be obedient, and
[2:15:31] he shall stand before Eleazar the
[2:15:33] priest, who shall ask counsel for him
[2:15:36] after the judgment of Urum, before the
[2:15:39] Lord. At his word thou shalt go out, and
[2:15:41] at his word they shall come in, both he
[2:15:43] and all the children of Israel with him,
[2:15:45] even all the congregation. And Moses did
[2:15:48] as the Lord commanded him. And he took
[2:15:50] Joshua, set him before Eliza the priest,
[2:15:53] before all the congregation and laid his
[2:15:55] hands upon him and gave him a
[2:15:58] charge as the Lord commanded him in the
[2:16:01] hand of Moses. Verse 18
[2:16:04] says in whom is the
[2:16:07] spirit. That word spirit is ruach. It
[2:16:09] means to smell or perceive or make of
[2:16:12] quick
[2:16:14] understanding. Joshua. And who's got the
[2:16:17] spirit? This guy's got some
[2:16:19] understanding.
[2:16:20] In fact, out of two million that came
[2:16:22] out of Egypt, there was only two.
[2:16:27] Joshua and
[2:16:28] Caleb. Do you know the name of Joshua is
[2:16:31] never even named in the New
[2:16:37] Testament. It ends in the Old Testament
[2:16:40] because
[2:16:42] Joshua becomes Jesus.
[2:16:47] Jehovah of the old
[2:16:50] becomes Jesus of the new.
[2:16:52] Watch. He's changing administration.
[2:16:55] Amen. When you begin to understand that,
[2:16:57] see
[2:16:59] Joshua means Jehovah Savior. It is a
[2:17:02] type of the Holy Ghost ministry that
[2:17:04] will lead the overcomers into the
[2:17:07] promised land.
[2:17:10] And understand this, this commission,
[2:17:12] this Joshua commission is not a person.
[2:17:16] It's not a church.
[2:17:21] It's universal.
[2:17:22] It's happening around the world right
[2:17:25] now. The ministry of Joshua, it is the
[2:17:28] ministry of adoption by means of the
[2:17:31] Holy Spirit because he's going to place
[2:17:33] you. You know, some of you don't even
[2:17:36] know your position and your place. You
[2:17:39] don't even know. Have I been pleased
[2:17:41] here at this church? Is this my
[2:17:44] pleasing? Has God placed me here? Have
[2:17:47] you ha has God placed you here under
[2:17:49] this ministry?
[2:17:51] Well, I don't know. I'm here for a
[2:17:53] season. Okay. Brother Bram said, "No,
[2:17:56] come on.
[2:17:58] Get under a pastor.
[2:18:01] Put your tent pigs down." Now, hey, that
[2:18:03] that's not saying you can't move.
[2:18:05] Brother Glenn and Sister Rachel are
[2:18:07] moving. they go with our blessing.
[2:18:09] Doesn't mean you can't move. But I'll
[2:18:11] tell you what, if they were moving over
[2:18:13] to
[2:18:15] Siberia and there was no church,
[2:18:19] there was no ministry there, there is
[2:18:22] churches in Siberia, excuse me, but what
[2:18:25] I'm saying, I'm just making a
[2:18:27] hypothetical.
[2:18:29] If he said, "Well, brother Ron, I'm not
[2:18:31] making any money here and I'm going over
[2:18:33] to Siberia because man, I can make big
[2:18:35] bucks.
[2:18:38] Then what's motivating his move?
[2:18:44] Because if you moved here for money,
[2:18:46] guess what? Another job come along
[2:18:48] that's a little bit more.
[2:18:51] Huh? Mucho din.
[2:18:55] Right.
[2:18:57] What'll happen? You'll start chasing the
[2:18:59] dollar. Amen. Next thing you know, hey,
[2:19:01] what it is is, you know, hey, you give
[2:19:04] me more money, I'll believe. That's why
[2:19:06] Jesus said, "When you go out into the
[2:19:08] world and you preach the gospel, take no
[2:19:10] money in your purse."
[2:19:12] Do you know missionaries from America
[2:19:15] have ruined mission fields? Because
[2:19:18] they've opened their doors with money.
[2:19:22] If you all come, I'll build you a
[2:19:23] church. You want me to build you a home,
[2:19:24] I'll buy you a car. If you believe, hey,
[2:19:27] listen, you go to a third world country,
[2:19:28] they'll believe anything you want them
[2:19:31] to believe. If you give me money, that's
[2:19:35] what I want. Yeah. Give me money. That's
[2:19:38] what I want.
[2:19:40] I've seen it.
[2:19:42] They'll believe anything you want them
[2:19:46] to believe if you support them
[2:19:47] financially.
[2:19:51] Brother Mario said, "Brother Ron, would
[2:19:52] you come go with me over to the
[2:19:54] Philippines?" I said, "What do I need to
[2:19:56] go to the Philippines for?" I said,
[2:19:58] "Every month you have 15 to 20
[2:20:00] missionaries from America over there,
[2:20:02] spending five and six weeks over in
[2:20:04] Philippines and going from this church,
[2:20:05] that church, this one over here, and
[2:20:07] they come back to their church. Look at
[2:20:08] me. I went to this church and this
[2:20:09] brother and all the people and they had
[2:20:11] the balloons and welcome pastor Ron
[2:20:13] Peterson. I remember the first time I
[2:20:15] go." I said, "Mario, I don't need to
[2:20:17] go." Well, anyway, he said, "Well, will
[2:20:19] you go with me over?" I I said, "Okay,
[2:20:21] let's
[2:20:22] go." So, we went there and we had this
[2:20:24] big meeting and had all these balloons.
[2:20:26] Remember that Pastor Ron Peterson and
[2:20:28] all the Hey, listen. The Filipinos love
[2:20:30] to
[2:20:31] party. They love balloons. They love
[2:20:35] food. They love to eat. They love to
[2:20:37] feast. Listen, they'll all pack into a
[2:20:39] car, a 10 passenger car. They'll put 17
[2:20:42] in
[2:20:44] it. And they'll go and they they go down
[2:20:47] the road and they get there and they're
[2:20:49] all happy. And so here we are and I got
[2:20:51] this big convention more more than what
[2:20:53] we got right here. And there's a bunch
[2:20:55] of ministers. Remember them all sitting
[2:20:56] up behind me. And I I had never been to
[2:20:59] the Philippines before. God bless you.
[2:21:01] It's so good to have you or have me here
[2:21:04] and and for the invitation. God bless
[2:21:06] you. But I want you brethren to know. I
[2:21:08] turned around to the ministers. I'm not
[2:21:09] here to build your church. I'm not here
[2:21:11] to build you a home or support you
[2:21:14] financially. Three of them got up. You
[2:21:15] remember that? They got up and walked
[2:21:17] off. I said, "Well, at least they're
[2:21:19] honest.
[2:21:24] because our missionaries have opened
[2:21:26] doors with money.
[2:21:29] See, if they don't come because of the
[2:21:31] gospel you preached, they're coming for
[2:21:33] the wrong reason. Jesus said, "Take no
[2:21:35] money in your purse. Go into the city
[2:21:38] and seek whom's worthy."
[2:21:41] Amen.
[2:21:43] Because they're coming because of what
[2:21:45] you're preaching, not because of what
[2:21:47] you can give them.
[2:21:52] Amen.
[2:21:53] God help us. We We as And I say this
[2:21:58] humbly, but American missionaries have
[2:22:01] been the worst around the world because
[2:22:06] they just throw money at this and that
[2:22:08] and build churches
[2:22:10] and then what happens to the
[2:22:13] people when that
[2:22:15] man is supportive? I've had ministers in
[2:22:20] Africa turn around tell their people, I
[2:22:23] don't even you people, I don't even need
[2:22:25] you guys anymore. I I've got
[2:22:26] missionaries that support me here in
[2:22:29] Africa and I I don't need your tithes
[2:22:31] and I don't need your because I got it
[2:22:32] all
[2:22:36] now. Can you
[2:22:39] imagine? Then what happens and they
[2:22:41] become a big
[2:22:43] person watch. Brother Rem said you
[2:22:45] watch. He said, "Stay humble before
[2:22:47] God." You know what I love about this
[2:22:49] ministry of brother Brennham? No matter
[2:22:51] how great a ministry, no matter how the
[2:22:53] signs and wonders, he never made himself
[2:22:56] somebody big.
[2:23:00] That's what attracted to me. Was the
[2:23:03] ministry that he preached,
[2:23:06] not the fancy suits, the big churches.
[2:23:11] No, he kept himself humble. Yes. God,
[2:23:15] help our ministers.
[2:23:17] Within the message, stay humble.
[2:23:21] It's not who's got the bigger church.
[2:23:23] It's not who's got the most people. No,
[2:23:26] it's stay humble before God.
[2:23:33] In the sermon
[2:23:37] paradox, Joshua, here's a type of the
[2:23:40] last day
[2:23:42] ministry. See, now remember those three
[2:23:45] stages of the
[2:23:47] journey. All of it ceased. First, the
[2:23:50] law and everything had to cease. So the
[2:23:53] Joshua is the same word as Jesus,
[2:23:56] Jehovah savior, that took them from
[2:23:58] their wilderness into the promised land.
[2:24:00] I don't want to disagree with the
[2:24:02] scholars, but many hold that the
[2:24:04] promised land represents heaven.
[2:24:08] Could not represent heaven. It could not
[2:24:11] because they had wars and troubles and
[2:24:14] flustrations and everything in the
[2:24:17] promised land. Listen, the promised land
[2:24:19] is the word for this hour. But you're
[2:24:21] going to have to fight for every
[2:24:22] promise. Amen.
[2:24:25] This isn't a picnic. That's right. The
[2:24:28] promised land. So, uh, well, you know,
[2:24:31] when I when I get into the message of
[2:24:33] the hour and there's no more fighting,
[2:24:36] it's all over and it's it's a bed of
[2:24:38] roses, it's going to be easy and
[2:24:40] everything's going to be okay and I'm
[2:24:41] going to walk around in in a in a stage
[2:24:44] of nirvana and everything is okay and
[2:24:47] love and and everything. No, let me tell
[2:24:49] you, young people, it's a battle. Amen.
[2:24:52] Older people, it's a battle.
[2:24:55] Spiritual mind battle, spiritual
[2:24:57] warfare.
[2:24:59] strongholds,
[2:25:01] things that you open up. You listen the
[2:25:03] wrong kind of thing, you listen the
[2:25:05] wrong kind of music, it'll catch that
[2:25:08] spirit, put a stronghold in there.
[2:25:13] Had a young boy over in Europe one time,
[2:25:15] he, you know, one of the pastor's kids
[2:25:17] over there, I told you before, but I'll
[2:25:19] tell you again. And he said, "Brother
[2:25:21] Ron, I go to church. you know, and I try
[2:25:24] to enter in, but I feel
[2:25:27] absolutely no anointing. I feel nothing.
[2:25:29] I I feel
[2:25:32] void. I feel
[2:25:34] numb. And so I began to counsel with
[2:25:36] him. I said, "Well, what do you do?
[2:25:38] Let's let's look." Brother Rem said, "It
[2:25:40] only takes a mere observation of look
[2:25:42] what they read, what they listen to,
[2:25:44] huh? And you begin to tell what kind of
[2:25:46] spirit they're feeding on." Amen. He
[2:25:49] said, "Well," he said, "Uh, I do listen
[2:25:51] to soft Christian rock." Oh, you do? I
[2:25:55] said, "Go outside and find a soft rock.
[2:25:57] Let me throw it at you." I said, "There
[2:26:00] is no such thing as soft rock."
[2:26:07] Put all the spiritual words into it you
[2:26:11] want. Jesus,
[2:26:15] it's still rock. That's right. Amen. Oh
[2:26:18] God, don't allow rock music to come back
[2:26:22] into the
[2:26:24] message. And you can tell just by its
[2:26:27] beat.
[2:26:31] The Holy Spirit likes
[2:26:37] music that invites his presence.
[2:26:43] Amen.
[2:26:52] Justin, Zoe,
[2:26:59] that kind of music. Amen.
[2:27:02] Draws his presence. Yes.
[2:27:05] When you sing those kind of songs,
[2:27:09] not well when I get my dancing shoes on,
[2:27:11] when the Holy Fire and I Hallelujah and
[2:27:14] Pentecost and glory, hallelujah, man.
[2:27:18] Praise God. What's the matter with you?
[2:27:20] If you got the Holy Ghost, you're going
[2:27:21] to get up. You're going to Oh, the
[2:27:28] No. What's that song we sang? That that
[2:27:30] last one? just to be close to you. Just
[2:27:33] to be close.
[2:27:35] I don't know if if if you felt it,
[2:27:38] but I just all all of a sudden I said,
[2:27:40] "Lord,
[2:27:42] that's my desire."
[2:27:46] I just want to be close to you. There's
[2:27:49] something about being close to somebody
[2:27:51] you love. Huh? As you sit down, hey,
[2:27:55] just come sit down close. And when he
[2:27:58] draws close, something happens.
[2:28:07] You see, brother Bram said, "When a seal
[2:28:09] opens, it declares war." Amen. That's
[2:28:13] right. So, when you begin to understand
[2:28:16] what the seals are all about, you come
[2:28:18] into spiritual warfare.
[2:28:24] Amen. Because these seals are Christ.
[2:28:27] Amen. Amen. That's why it went from the
[2:28:31] cross to the cloud two parts of
[2:28:35] redemption. You got to come and enter
[2:28:37] into this message to know your position
[2:28:42] because the Holy Spirit will lead you
[2:28:44] and guide you into all truth. That's why
[2:28:47] the importance of you having the baptism
[2:28:49] of the Holy Spirit, not to just be
[2:28:51] baptized in water. Remember in the book
[2:28:54] of Acts, how was you baptized?
[2:28:57] Well, we was baptized unto John. Well,
[2:28:59] that's good. John baptized you unto
[2:29:02] repentance. But didn't John said,
[2:29:04] "There's coming another one after me
[2:29:07] whose baptism is far greater. I baptize
[2:29:10] you under repentance." That's the start.
[2:29:14] But he'll baptize you
[2:29:18] with the Holy Ghost and fire. Amen.
[2:29:26] Fire musicians if you come now I
[2:29:30] am coming to a
[2:29:32] close
[2:29:35] fire. Let the God
[2:29:38] who is God.
[2:29:41] Let him answer by fire. Amen. Amen. Is
[2:29:44] that what Elijah said?
[2:29:52] And after everybody else had tore down
[2:29:54] the altar of God, cut themselves,
[2:29:56] screamed all night, Elijah mocked them,
[2:29:59] and said, "I think your God's asleep. I
[2:30:01] think he's on vacation. Why don't you
[2:30:02] cry louder?" So they jumped and shouted
[2:30:04] and screamed and hollered, and he said,
[2:30:06] "Are you guys done?" And the altar was
[2:30:09] broke down. "Are you guys done?" You
[2:30:12] tried to whoop it up.
[2:30:16] You cut yourself. You got real sincere.
[2:30:19] He said there was no fire that answered.
[2:30:22] Amen. And Elijah said, "Let the God who
[2:30:26] answers by fire,
[2:30:29] let him be
[2:30:34] God." What is the fire that you should
[2:30:37] have in your life?
[2:30:40] The fiery baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:30:44] There's no greater cleansing
[2:30:46] in this world than fire. Fire, no, no
[2:30:49] impurities can live through fire. Fire
[2:30:52] kills it all.
[2:30:56] I'm afraid what we've done as ministers
[2:30:58] in this message, we we've kind of
[2:31:00] preached it symptoms
[2:31:03] instead of the root cause.
[2:31:07] Well, I'll tell you what. You look at
[2:31:08] that young girl and the way she dresses
[2:31:10] and it's immoral. Look at the shoes she
[2:31:12] wears. Look at look at this. And I tell
[2:31:14] you what, I get an opportunity. I'mma
[2:31:15] preach against that and and next thing
[2:31:18] you know,
[2:31:25] yeah, you can see by an outward
[2:31:28] manifestation there's something wrong.
[2:31:32] That's all. You know what she needs?
[2:31:41] You know what? She needs
[2:31:44] to go deeper.
[2:31:48] Simple.
[2:31:50] If she'll humble herself,
[2:31:52] if she'll ask of him, "Come unto me all
[2:31:56] ye that are weary and are heavy laden, I
[2:31:58] will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
[2:32:01] you and learn of me. For my yoke is easy
[2:32:04] and my burden is light.
[2:32:09] Yes, Lord. Let them fall in love with
[2:32:11] Jesus. Amen.
[2:32:14] And then you know what? You don't have
[2:32:16] to preach about the long skirt. It will
[2:32:18] come. That's right.
[2:32:21] It will come. Why? It's an outward
[2:32:24] manifestation of an inward revelation.
[2:32:28] Amen. No more cutting the hair. No more
[2:32:31] painting the
[2:32:33] nails. No more high heel shoes.
[2:32:38] Amen.
[2:32:40] How about if I play on the guy's side
[2:32:42] right
[2:32:43] now? No
[2:32:45] more worldly haircuts like the world has
[2:32:48] right now. You can have sidewalls here
[2:32:50] and then you can have a pompador out
[2:32:52] here.
[2:32:56] Skinny jeans. Looks like you were
[2:32:58] painted in them.
[2:33:02] Ain't nobody saying amen. No. Come on,
[2:33:04] brother.
[2:33:05] Preach them. Come on.
[2:33:10] Yeah.
[2:33:13] [Music]
[2:33:15] Truth. Truth. It It is truth. Amen. You
[2:33:19] think you young guys, I don't know that
[2:33:22] you play around with this stuff,
[2:33:28] huh? God help us. Amen.
[2:33:37] our our our young our youth chat group.
[2:33:43] Somebody had
[2:33:45] placed a
[2:33:49] video of them
[2:33:53] singing and it was it was a big
[2:33:56] auditorium and there was all these
[2:33:58] people and they were
[2:34:00] singing and the group was called Hill
[2:34:03] Song. I don't follow them. I don't
[2:34:06] listen to contemporary music, but it was
[2:34:09] on there and I thought, "Oh, all it is
[2:34:11] is got those uh
[2:34:13] HGQ this that line here
[2:34:17] slash go to the YouTube channel." So, I
[2:34:20] hit it and I don't know what it is. And
[2:34:22] here it is. Where? Oh, yes. Oh, what we
[2:34:25] need, you know, and they're all singing.
[2:34:28] It's a beautiful song. And the lady's
[2:34:31] voice is beautiful.
[2:34:37] and her hair is cut shorter than
[2:34:42] mine. Her nails all made up, wearing a
[2:34:45] t-shirt,
[2:34:47] pants, and getting the people to sing.
[2:34:54] I'd almost like to show you
[2:34:56] that just to make the example that you
[2:34:59] could
[2:35:01] see that you could see and say, "Well,
[2:35:04] hey, young
[2:35:05] people, young people, listen. I'd rather
[2:35:08] step down and quit right now. I'd rather
[2:35:10] step down and quit right now than I
[2:35:12] would to compromise with this message."
[2:35:14] Amen. And say, "Oh, that's okay." So,
[2:35:16] our young people, it's okay. You know
[2:35:18] what? Watch. Hey, it's Jesus. What we
[2:35:21] need now is
[2:35:23] Jesus. Steve, in fact, I'm going to I
[2:35:27] sent you the video. James, I sent you
[2:35:29] the video. Can you give it to those guys
[2:35:32] right now? Can they look it up? Can we
[2:35:35] play it right now? Get your phone. One
[2:35:38] of you guys go, go, go. Oh, go show
[2:35:40] them. Then they can look it
[2:35:44] up. Yeah. I just feel to do this. You
[2:35:46] You guys want to see Jezebel religion?
[2:35:49] Amen.
[2:35:51] You want to see what the world and those
[2:35:54] whose names are not written in the
[2:35:55] lamb's book of life shall be deceived.
[2:35:58] Will they worship? Absolutely. I want
[2:36:00] you to notice Cain worshiped.
[2:36:04] I want to ask you, who was the first
[2:36:06] leader of worship and of music in the
[2:36:09] kingdom of heaven?
[2:36:11] What was his name? Lucifer. Does he know
[2:36:15] how to worship? You better believe it.
[2:36:18] and he wants to be worshiped as
[2:36:21] God.
[2:36:23] Okay, here it is. And if you would and
[2:36:25] you guys just kind of hang on here for a
[2:36:27] second. So, we'll go ahead and turn up
[2:36:29] the the music or the sound so we can
[2:36:32] hear this. We'll play just a few
[2:36:34] minutes, but listen to it.
[2:36:38] [Music]
[2:36:56] Come on. We sing
[2:36:59] together. Call me
[2:37:03] [Music]
[2:37:05] out the great
[2:37:08] unknown where he may fail.
[2:37:15] And
[2:37:15] there
[2:37:18] [Music]
[2:37:21] you
[2:37:23] see my faith will stand. Come on, you
[2:37:27] make it your prayer.
[2:37:29] [Music]
[2:37:32] Come on, make it your prayer.
[2:37:37] Jesus above the
[2:37:41] waves. When ocean rise, my soul will
[2:37:45] rest in your embrace.
[2:37:48] For I am
[2:37:52] yours and you are mine.
[2:37:56] [Music]
[2:38:12] All right, I think we've made the
[2:38:15] point.
[2:38:18] Beautiful voice, isn't it?
[2:38:21] Got a beautiful voice.
[2:38:25] But when you begin to look at who's
[2:38:27] singing,
[2:38:30] understand it's not the
[2:38:35] image of a Holy Ghost fil Christian.
[2:38:38] Amen.
[2:38:39] Yet the anointing is falling upon the
[2:38:42] just and the unjust. Go ahead and play.
[2:38:44] You were playing what was it? Deeper.
[2:38:46] Take me
[2:38:53] [Music]
[2:38:55] deeper. Is that the kind of music I want
[2:38:59] our young people to listen
[2:39:02] to? I'm not talking about this
[2:39:10] music. Now, I'm not attacking the
[2:39:13] people. You understand
[2:39:20] that? But there's a spirit behind
[2:39:25] [Music]
[2:39:28] it. There's a spirit in the world right
[2:39:32] now that just wants people religious.
[2:39:36] And you saw them. Were they sincere?
[2:39:38] Yeah. Oh,
[2:39:43] absolutely. And probably they were they
[2:39:46] were really feeling the rain falling
[2:39:48] upon them and they were thinking, "Oh,
[2:39:50] God.
[2:39:51] Yes. Come on. Let's pray now. All of
[2:39:54] you. Let's sing this. The oceans are
[2:39:57] deep and all of this." And it's
[2:39:59] melodious and yes, and God's ex he's
[2:40:03] accepting every sacrifice that we bring
[2:40:06] to him. He's not Amen.
[2:40:10] That's the deception.
[2:40:12] There are many that honorth me with
[2:40:14] their lips, but their hearts are far
[2:40:16] from me. In vain do they worship me.
[2:40:20] Brother Bram said, "It won't be the
[2:40:23] bootleger, won't be the
[2:40:25] prostitute that at that day are
[2:40:27] disappointed."
[2:40:29] It' be those who are religious who
[2:40:32] somebody Now I went I'm going to share
[2:40:34] one more little testimony. You guys
[2:40:36] excuse me. My wife, her older sister,
[2:40:40] her oldest
[2:40:42] sister, her husband died last
[2:40:47] week. They're a very strict Catholic
[2:40:50] family. Sandy was raised very strict
[2:40:54] Catholic. So, we got there and we were a
[2:40:56] little bit late and all the people
[2:40:58] sitting outside. It was up in
[2:41:00] Prescat. We got in the chairs and there
[2:41:03] was a Catholic
[2:41:05] priest was giving his testimony and he
[2:41:08] said I was good friends with his name
[2:41:10] was Edward and good friends is Edward
[2:41:12] and we were buddies and he went to one
[2:41:14] college and I went to another college
[2:41:16] and I became a priest a Catholic priest
[2:41:19] and I remember after I married Sandy and
[2:41:22] we came to Sandy's family outings and a
[2:41:26] Catholic priest the same one that was
[2:41:28] speaking yesterday is the Catholic
[2:41:30] priest that I saw there with the family.
[2:41:33] And he's drinking beer and getting
[2:41:35] drunk, telling dirty jokes with the
[2:41:38] people. And I was there. I saw
[2:41:41] it. This is when
[2:41:43] I first married Sandy. So the priest
[2:41:47] said, you know, this was the end of his
[2:41:50] little thing. And again, I'm not
[2:41:52] attacking the people, but this what he
[2:41:55] said. You know, I can't just imagine
[2:41:57] going to heaven and angels fluttering
[2:42:00] their wings and us singing and
[2:42:02] worshiping. He said, "That doesn't sound
[2:42:04] like fun to me." He said, "You know
[2:42:07] what? I'm thinking, this is what he said
[2:42:10] in front of all these people, Catholic
[2:42:13] priests. I think it would be beautiful
[2:42:16] for God to take us up onto a big
[2:42:18] mountain with big tall trees and
[2:42:21] cascading
[2:42:22] uh rivers that came down and we get up
[2:42:25] there on top and we just sit there and
[2:42:28] kind of enjoy nature and then there
[2:42:31] would be a big cooler of
[2:42:34] beer and a pack of Marboro
[2:42:38] cigarettes. And that's what I think
[2:42:40] heaven is about.
[2:42:42] That's what I think we'll be doing in
[2:42:46] heaven. Everybody kind
[2:42:48] of beer and
[2:42:51] cigarettes. Are you kidding
[2:42:53] me? I
[2:42:57] thought is that what saints of God I do?
[2:43:00] I I want to go to a
[2:43:02] place where angel wings
[2:43:08] where people sing.
[2:43:12] where people worship.
[2:43:15] Where God is their God and he is the
[2:43:17] light of the city. Amen. And where we
[2:43:20] worship him together. I I don't want a
[2:43:25] mansion. Honestly, I don't look for a
[2:43:27] mansion. I I didn't ask God for a
[2:43:29] mansion. I just
[2:43:32] [Music]
[2:43:35] I just want to be where he is.
[2:43:41] And if he would just take me deeper Yes.
[2:43:45] than where I've ever been before
[2:43:50] and let me love him more and more.
[2:43:58] Amen. Take me deeper.
[2:44:05] Deeper than
[2:44:07] ever with
[2:44:10] you, Jesus. Hold me close to your
[2:44:19] embrace. Take me deeper.
[2:44:22] [Music]

[2:44:36] more. Now I
[2:44:38] long to be
[2:44:41] deeper in love.
[2:44:48] There is a
[2:44:51] longing for the only you can
[2:44:57] feel. A raging
[2:45:01] tempest that only you can feel.
