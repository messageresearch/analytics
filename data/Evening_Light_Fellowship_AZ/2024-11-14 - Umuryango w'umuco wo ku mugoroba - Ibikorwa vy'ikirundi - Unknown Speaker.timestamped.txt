[42:34] Chang the
[42:40] M
[42:52] amen with the
[42:54] title in your Bible
[42:58] of Jesus Christ event of that
[43:14] day the resurrection of Jesus Christ and
[43:19] the event on that day start in Matthew
[43:24] 28 in the end of the Sabbath it began to
[43:28] toward the first day of the week I don't
[43:30] know if I already preached
[43:48] this so my title tonight
[43:53] ising
[43:56] tonight to keep us on
[43:58] fire I know the cold weather is coming
[44:01] in but we
[44:06] need in the end of
[44:10] theath the
[44:30] and the first one that
[44:32] re the
[44:39] resen the
[44:52] church this message the the message that
[45:03] another denin
[45:28] and behold there was a
[45:37] great if there is an
[45:41] angeling time and r
[46:05] Hallelujah so notice the first
[46:08] thing that happened as part of the
[46:10] resurrection of
[46:23] Christ then the third part there was a
[46:26] commission
[46:51] prophesying is
[46:54] a do this and do that
[47:17] are to
[47:21] believe directly addressed to each and
[47:24] every one of us
[47:27] so three things so that the way the ear
[47:30] days chch re
[47:34] re that's why the Revelation is
[47:40] so sometimes God
[47:47] reveal
[47:51] later of
[47:53] commotion even in the
[47:55] disciples they don't believe the
[48:23] report to you
[48:28] look at Thomas he he refused to believe
[48:31] the testimony of the 10
[48:37] disciples because we have also met an
[48:39] angels in
[48:44] this so that no one can get
[48:57] if we preach we are just a
[49:04] messenger so in the
[49:09] message look at the
[49:16] millions
[49:20] speaking that he was
[49:25] here can we say
[49:28] the
[49:37] of what is
[49:42] Happ look at the Millions on
[49:48] Earth so remember the
[50:08] you need to be thankful
[50:13] we included in that great Resurrection
[50:17] morning coming that morning
[50:52] seeking out his own ship
[51:00] he said
[51:04] we right now in
[51:08] oural we have the ear in oural
[51:12] bodies predestinated on are the
[51:19] first to be
[51:22] quickened when the Holy Spirit comes
[51:49] can we think of
[51:57] something to thankful
[52:00] thankful it is the message
[52:05] to poor we
[52:10] are are
[52:27] his resurrection he
[52:30] said
[52:38] right you are theive
[53:07] are but Satan
[53:10] is you are you are you are
[53:13] done but he is accusing
[53:18] you he don't recognize your

[53:43] youing his word to us and the
[53:49] word book
[53:56] can read
[53:59] it e
[54:02] anointing the book
[54:06] of you cannot read
[54:10] about but in
[54:19] the things that the father had our
[54:25] mind it was a direct
[54:28] message no more
[54:30] prophecy more history no
[54:33] morees was

[57:16] Jesus of Nazareth it could be in them in
[57:19] the
[57:42] he was the word
[57:44] first and a word really
[58:01] for the same Jesus is
[58:12] not
