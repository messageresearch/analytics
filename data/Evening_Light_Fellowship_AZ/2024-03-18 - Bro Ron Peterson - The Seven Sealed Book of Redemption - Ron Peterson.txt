people it's so good to be able to be in this battle with each and every one of you and good to see you fight in the right Ty it's good to see you my friend amen so just before I sing this song this morning it was just thinking of a few thoughts came along with it and it so easy for us it's a Temptation that we have that are walking in the light of our day to to have the attitude that we're better than others we're the called out of the called out of the called out and but we've seen our name in the book we know who we are but you know John saw his name in the book and he came back after being the AIS of and he said let us love one another Paul taught us that love was didn't VA itself it was not puffed up and just along those lines a couple of examples I just wanted to to share I remember brother brandom talking about you know if you you get to heaven before I do he says one morning you wake up and say you may hear somebody down a little cabin on the back porch just singing Amazing Grace they say well brother Brandon made it and just that humility that he had not you know I'm going to have a big mansion myself but even with that you know you come down and see me I'll just be happy I made it amen and I think that's each of our thoughts this morning and then also just thinking of that example that our Prophet shared with us of the the man who owned the ranch in col and his son came out there looking for a a wife and he saw the one that didn't have the character that her cousins had in a good way she didn't but when her attitude wasn't you know look at me I'm the one that was chosen it was like I'm I'm not worthy and I just I so appreciate that and so this song that want to sing for you this morning [Music] just another thought that goes along with that and Jesus himself was a t having any conversation with his disciples Bram said one cold rainy night they said to him Master we'll go home with you he said the foxes have holes the birds have nests but I don't even have a place to lay my head say said god Jehovah humbled himself and became a man represented in sinful flesh to redeem you and me who are we then he was our example who am I nothing yes and so I just wanted to share that before we sang this song for you this morning well when I think think of how he came so far from Glory he came to dwell among the lon such as I to suffer shame and such disgrace on Mount calary take my place then I ask myself this question who am I oh who am I that king would bleed and die for who am I that he would say not my will thine for oh the answer I may never know why he ever loved me so and to an Old Rugged Cross he'd go for who am [Music] I and then I'm reminded of his words I'll leave you never so just be true I'll give to you life forever and forever I wonder what I could have done to deserve God's only son he'll fight my battles until they're one for who am I would you sing it with me this morning oh who am I that a king would bleed and die for oh who am I that he would sing not my will thine for the answer I may never know just why he ever Lov me so that to an Old Rugged Cross he'd gone yes to an Old Rugged Cross he'd go oh wo to an Old Rugged Cross he' go for who am I if Greg and Jill and Alysa will come they're going to sing a second song special this morning amen want want to thank the Lord last night John and Joy came over with Greg and and Hannah and we were making pizzas outside and I in a pizza oven and I put my head too close and the flame came out and singed my hair and my eyebrows I didn't know about it until I got back in the house and they looked at me I'm going like what happened to you but I just want to say thank the Lord that the Lord was mindful of me and amen could have been bad he still the fire yeah he is amen [Music] amen thank the Lord Lord bless them as they sing today sometimes I feel discour and I think my life in vain I'm temped to my and of my lot [Music] complain but when I think of Jesus and all he's done for me then I cry oh Rock of [Applause] AES I th [Music] me sometimes it seems I dare on go one step farther [Music] on and from from my heart all cage has slipped away and

put it on the street amen God bless you all this morning welcome all our visitors that are here today I certainly enjoyed preaching on the ministry of the son of man amen all is well thank the Lord for my technicians that they know what to do and can fix things even on the on the Fly I start to get nervous up here they don't they just fix it I did I enjoyed preaching on the ministry of the son of man and if all of you would realize it is that son of man Ministry that has touched every one of your lives and if he has not touched your life I pray that at some time you will meet him and you will wrestle with him even as Jacob did and that's when his life was changed not by hearing the stories wonderful sit on the lap of his grandfather Abraham and his father Isaac and go ahead and hear all the stories and what it was like to be in the great meetings and to see God and mzc and on and on and on but it never changed Jacob right but there come a time yes on remember God keeps all his appointments there came a time when he was left alone you know saints of God there uh there are times in your life when God wants you alone yes that's true you can be in a whole crowd of people and be alone and when God gets you alone and it was there that when he was alone and he laid down didn't even really recognize that God was there and put his head up upon a stone as a pillow and God began to deal with him he woke up he said oh what a awesome place this is this is none other than the house of God and I pray that even as Jacob said this is the house of God and he recognized that something Supernatural was happening yeah sir I pray that that Supernatural will come down here and visit each and every one of us touch us give us visions of Jacob's letter of what God has done yes what he is doing and what he will do amen and that'll certainly touch your lives amen I enjoyed the song specials I was in the back room and was John yor was singing that who am I yes really who am I where did I come from and when it's all over and they lay me down to rest where am I going those are all questions that you've got to answer in your own life I thank God that I heard the voice of a seventh angel messenger one day he told me where I come from yes showed me where I'm going am and allowed me to see my position in the hour in which I live I thank God for that turn with me if you would to the Book of Genesis chapter 2 and all our friends and visitors each and everyone it's good to see each and every one of you here today and and Robert has mentioned you all so I don't want to take the time to greet you all once again but we love you in Christ and you know that some of our friends go way back that are here this morning and we love them dearly Genesis 2: 7-9 then we'll go to 15-1 17 then we'll go to Genesis 3 and I want to see because we've been talking about the ministry of the son of man and I want to because it's all wrapped around something that's called The Book of redemption what is this book who holds it what's in it Genesis 2: 7-9 and in Genesis chapter 2 I want you to notice those of you that are Bible students that from Genesis one up until two everything that God did he created and God said and God did and God said and God said but brother Brenham said he changed his name from God said to the Lord God he was wanting to show his Plan of Redemption with man his Affinity with man so from then on it's no more and God said and God said you'll find out every verse now and the Lord God and the Lord God isn't that wonderful how much he loves us and the Lord God formed a man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils a breath of life and Man became a living Soul the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed amen and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil verse 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it notice he had a job before he had a wife the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou must mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die what a warning he said look everything here every tree and brother Bram said watch those two trees in the garden the tree of life and the tree of knowledge and he said cuz that tree and those two seeds are going to intertwine they're going to go all the way from Genesis to Revelation Genesis 3: 22- 24 and the Lord God said behold the man is as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth for his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live [Applause] forever therefore the L the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden and to till the ground from whence he was taken and so he drove out the man brother brandham said one of the heartbreaking portions of scripture that God is driving his own son out of Eden on and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherums and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life it was there they were supposed to eat of it and now it's guarded yep L they eat of the Tree of Life in a fallen State and forever would be in that position yet God knew what to do yes he did Heavenly Father Lord as we have read your word this morning and Lord there was so much that uh you were just showing me yesterday and I got into a a place where father I didn't know in which direction to go and therefore I humbled myself before you and I said oh Father thou has given me the thought but accept that you take it now and add to it Lord I'm in a confused State and confusions of the devil so therefore father as thy son I ask show me thy way oh God and what you would have me to say to thy people that your people would be blessed and I thank you Lord that you came came by and you came and you spoke to my heart and I pray now father let that which has been put into my heart be placed upon theirs yes Lord we ask it For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah so the tree of life was protected away from God's children lest they eat of that tree and live forever in a fallen State now this morning I want to title my sermon the seven sealed book of redemption and I want to take a subject this morning as the abstract the abstract title deed the second part to Redemption am amen and I'd like to go into a little bit greater detail what does it mean to have an abstract tile deed I lived in flagdale for about 13 years all three of our children were born there and we worked there and I got my real estate license there and sold real estate for 3 years with brother Robson and um I learned some things in getting my real estate license that every time a piece of property is sold you have to buy Title Insurance any of you bought a home piece of property you have Title Insurance well what's Title Insurance why do I need it well you want to make sure that there's no leans or an encumbrance or somebody that lays claim oh no I own that property hey that guy sold it to me whatever so you pay for somebody to legally to go search the title to find out does anybody say that they've got legal right or an incumbrance on that property and every piece of property has what they call a legal description because you have to have a point of beginning right and you know that God does that within his word he tells you he told the children of Israel from the River Jordan over to Mount Si over to this and he goes and that is what is called uh a meets and Bounds description from this big rock over to that big tree so many meters this and that because they didn't you know back then uh they didn't have the longitude and latitude that we have today but if any of you buy a piece of property it'll say and this is the point of beginning and so from this point of beginning it'll tell you northward Southward whatever you go so many meters stop that is a point of reference that is what when you all have a property surveyed the surveyor will set your boundary Corners everybody want wants to know what's mine I don't want my neighbor encroaching on my property if I'm going to build a wall I want to build it right where I should I want to know my how many of you are interested in your property boundaries because what's yours you want amen so it has a point of a beginning and then it must come back to that point of beginning Alpha must come back to Omega amen so you have this title insurance somebody in the title company now researches is out and looks if there is a cloud on the title that means there's an encumbrance there's an issue there's an abnormality ho hold it you can't buy this property till we clean up the title and an abstract title is a written record this I got right off of uh the dictionary that details a property's complete legal history from its first recording of ownership to present day I thought that's pretty good an abstract title details every title transfer and previous owner as well as any leans or other legal actions against the property now brother Brenham describes this so much of the time and he tells us that we've got to go back to the abstract title deed and he said what Adam lost in the beginning has got to be returned and it all is tied together with an abstract title beat the blood of the Lamb that was shed at Calvary paid the price for every lean that was on the property every sin everything that you ever did he paid the price somebody say Amen that ought to make you happy honestly it ought to make every one of you in your heart say thank God and I have an advocate before the father who therefore can lay any charge to God's elect prise the Lord so this book of redemption is called the legal history going all the way back to the original owner now Jesus came to seek and to save that which was lost amen you understand that now you can't claim something that was yours unless you owned it before you lost it that's right so he's not saving those that are not his I come to seek and to save my sheep those who have lost their position those who have lost their inheritance I came to seek and to save and return them back and I'm going to be your kinsman redeemer and I'm going to lay my life down I'm going to pay the price and the case is dismissed amen but there's two parts to Redemption right Calvary paid the price but what happened to the book Adam lost it listen to his wife brother Brenan picks this up in the sermon the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals so now he's he's coming into this gap between what is happening between the seven Church ages and the opening of the seals now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God the title deed to the Earth and to eternal life when Adam forfeited it then Satan dirty's hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner God himself we're going to find that out in a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand is this bringing anything up to your mind right now of him who sat on the throne and he had a a book sealed it was in his hand I want you to understand if we don't have the seven sealed book of redemption the second part to Redemption there's two parts to Redemption coming out and going into you will find out how absolutely important it is there would be no Redemption without the opening of those seals why because he is the [Applause] Hallelujah except that he died and the corner wheat except it be be planted and died it abideth alone oh if Satan would have only known what he uh had planned that corn of wheat had to Die the vessel had to be broken open brother Brenham said there was that seed hanging and he says and what they did water blood spirit constitutes a birth and there it was out of his side went water and blood and he cried and his Spirit left him water blood spirit shows a birth you know what God was doing spilling his seed the Bible says that his seed was in his soul and he poured out his soul unto death and there the whole new testament church every one the elect seed were spilled out upon the Earth God thought he he he had solved the problem excuse me Satan thought he had got him I've got him as long as I can keep him three days that's all I got to do it's over it's finished no more Messiah no one because no one's worthy to take the book Thank You Lord on and there he sits on the throne with it in his hand and when Adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith it went back to the hands of the original owner almighty God what a great thing what's it doing in the hands of God waiting for Redemption claims what is that book in his hand it's a seven sealed book of redemption he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back I don't want to get ahead of myself but what does brother Bram say is written in the book he said the names of the elect those redeemed he said and when he comes he comes to take the names Hallelujah do you understand what he's all of those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that book of redemption he's coming to claim which is his oh what a happening what an event no wonder brother Brenham had to wait and get alone he had to cut himself off from all of people and distractions and get alone and pray oh I don't know what these seals hold I went back and looked at my notes and how I preached the first several seals in about 20 minutes and oh he he looked at Clarence lar and he looked at hislop's Two Babylons he looked at all of these writings and now he's getting Alone come on he is now getting alone with God oh God I'm depending on you for that first seal amen hallelujah do you understand my brother my sister God shows it in the heavens before it happens on Earth amen amen he is to meet with seven Mighty Angels he's caught up into a constellation what is God doing he's absolutely taking his Prophet yeah and programming him to be prepared to meet but now he's caught up supernaturally do you understand those of you that recently went to Sunset Mountain it's a location there's nothing special about the location other than the fact that God had his Prophet there for a reason on there he says a clap came down from heaven he says run hide quick get under cover there blast came down picked him up do you realize he took off his hat and he said there he was caught up into a constellation of seven angels Wings swept back Mighty Angels coming from eternity he said I look to those angels He said but the seventh [Music] one saints of God this message is more than Church ORD it is God fulfilling scripture Amen Let me just go on in the breach again paragraph 118 what is this book of redemption this title deed Abstract title deed you say abstract what does an abstract mean means it searched all the way back to its beginning don't you like that listen this Prophet did not go to Genesis one in the beginning he went beyond he said I'm going to go beyond the beginning I'm going to go back to where this whole thing began to evolve and where was it evolving remember that you have a mind and the mind is called the womb to the soul and here God in his great mind he was an eternal being he was a spirit there was no Angels there was nothing to worship him and he began to think and his thoughts because he's Eternal his thoughts are Eternal and there he began to develop in his mind it was the developing place let me tell you what God was doing am he was developing you for a time and a season he knew he took from your great grandfather father and your grandfather and your father and he took this and this and this and everything and you are not a mistake you came down here and God designed you exactly as you are with every problem with every complex and yet God still loves you somebody ought to say hallelujah he knew me and my challenges he knew my complexes he knew my failures he knew my faults and while I was yet a sinner Christ died for me Hallelujah it wasn't my works it wasn't my the things that I'm going to do right or wrong that had nothing to do with it he said by election I've called you there in back of my mind I'm going to go beyond Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created I'm going to go beyond Genesis one I'm going to go when he wasn't even God come on and there he began to think these thoughts a thought unless it's spoken is never manifested but when a thought is spoken on the lips of deity it becomes a manifestation and God thoughts about light and he says there in his mind the prophet said oh he was thinking the properties of light and what it'll do and it'll be a separation from Darkness but said there it just stayed as a thought until he said let there be light Thank you lord and there was light yes the power of the SP spoken word somebody say amen and When sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator again and you become a Son of God Abstract title deed is held in the hand of the almighty oh my thank you Lord now we all know that the prophet of God taught many times that Redemption has two parts there is a coming out and a going into the laws of redemption are not complete unless you have both amen you can come out and not go in too right it's not just coming out of denomination but it's going into the Promised word of the hour how many believers do you know that are just satisfied oh praise God I come out of that old Harlot system but have you gone into the message of the hour I don't want to just talk about it I want to experience it I want the message in me because the message is [Applause] Christ I want to show you because we know types and shadows through scripture First Corinthians 10 veres 1-2 moreover Brethren I wouldn't that you should not be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and the Sea now we know Moses never baptized ized but there's an anointing John said I baptize you surely with water but there's one coming after me whose baptism is far greater so and did eat all and all did eat of the same spiritual meat did drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ Christ that anointing but many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolators as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 3 and 20,000 people one day brother R says how does a church or a people commit adultery on Christ the word he said when you knowing better by the Intercourse of the mind yeah add to take away from the word of God you're absolutely committing spiritual adultery on Christ the word and you think that God's going to allow neither fornicators nor adulterers nor a feminine those that love a lie are not going to make Heaven their home don't think you can play around with this message don't you add to it don't you take away from it I'm not interested in your opinion I want to know God's opinion and God's Prophet gave us God's opinion amen hallelujah neither let us tempt Christ of some of them tempted were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured when destroyed to the Destroyer now all these things happened unto them for in samples as they as they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come whom the ends of the world we're we're there are we not this is it this is lot you seea there's not going to be another church age he said don't worry about historians having to write down what's going on now he said there'll not be another group to read it amen written for our admonition upon the whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall many of them came out of Egypt but Egypt did not come out of them they get out there and just go through a couple trials next thing you know they're crying take us back to the leaks and garlics they forgot the whip of the Taskmaster in amazing God delivers you and sets you free from something and the next thing you know you start going through a trial and you start looking back at Egypt like man I didn't have such trouble that's what I'm having now brother Bram said you have entered a Warfare he said it's not a picnic that's right Jesus even warned you he said Hey listen they hated me they're going to hate you yeah well I don't I want everybody love me well then don't be a Christian cuz he told you you're going to be hated for my name's sake he said trials tribulations are going to come those that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution well I won't tell anybody I'll just kind of be a secret believer nonsense remember many of them that came out of Egypt did not cross over into Canaan so there's a coming out and a going into many died in the wilderness Journey some were bitten by serpents and died some rebelled in the wilderness tried to overthrow the leadership of Moses Dayan and korus said you take up too much Authority for yourself and guess what the Earth God finally told Moses separate yourself Moses first stood in the Gap because he played the part of Christ take me first God said hey you know it's nice but step aside Moses I'm going to huh and the Bible says and any of those that even appertained had anything to do listen to their tapes supported their Ministry of dethan and Kora he said the Earth what happened to all these Believers that start saying oh well you know what brother brand a prophet at this hour you know I made mistakes and the dates and all this kind of stuff and so why like this yeah daan Kora go ahead cuz everything that appertaineth to you you watch those who leave this message what does the world do swallows them up do you see any of their lives becoming better Christians than what we know in the message show me one just a matter of time and they go right back to that same Harlot system some of them have left this message and they've gone back to the Harlot system and even been read baptized now in the name of father son Holy Ghost like a hog to its wall and a dog to its vomit M so we understand that these things were given to us for our example history is repeating itself even today we're in another Exodus Journey are we not listen the people thought they were following Moses but Moses was following the pillar of Fire right you're not following William brandom you're following the pillar of [Applause] fire Hebrews 4: 1 and 2 let us therefore fear right A Promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preach did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it Faith you see without faith it's impossible to please God therefore you've got to have Revelation you got to have a a working no wonder God had to send a messenger to bring us back in this day to give us a a a message that will return our hearts back to the faith right of our fathers you understand that thank God Amen Hallelujah we can see by what happened in the garden and what happened to Eden to Adam Adam never lost his sunship he just lost his inheritance and that was given him before the fall if you're a true son or daughter of God you never lost your sunship you just lost your inheritance that depends upon each one of you to claim your inheritance that belongs to you because understand though something bewilder you do you realize that even if you have a living trust you have somebody who uh who is it that the ex what do you call them executor executor of the will trustee a trustee of the will so then you get the family because you know what hey Mom and Dad might have left us something I get a bicycle skateboard or something you're hoping for more than that some of you ain't worth a skateboard anyway depends on how obedient you are so the executive of the will he reads the will but guess what you got to be there you got to be present and they say uh okay are you are you one of these that's named on this this trust uh yes sir what is your legal name like in the hospital you realize every time a person comes to you in your hospital room let me see your wrist what is your birthday who's your grandmother who's your grandfather what's your your address are you sure it's you what are we operating on today Mr Peterson wake up wake up you need your sleeping bill you got to be [Applause] keeping hey I've had him do it I am not joking to you wake up wake up it's time for your sleeping pill okay listen here's a synopsis of what Adam and Eve lost cuz we're talking about brother Brenham said that title deed was forfeited he said they lost the right to eternal life because the day you eat thereof is the day you you're going to die you're cut off no more eternal life they lost their position in the garden and they were cast out and guess what he didn't have to work in the garden right everything was there oh he tilled the ground and everything but that was it now by the sweat of your brow I remember brother Mitch Buckingham we were just young kids in the message a short time he said praise God he says I know why I don't like to go to work he said it's not God's original will imagine now they're cast out they lost their power over nature and all the animals before then if there was a grizzly bear or if there was something there they didn't have to run from it it didn't run from the hey come here man you want you want to wrestle come on right they lost lost their Affinity with nature and they lost their power of the spoken word to say whatever and tree be plucked up and go over here right so they lost the power of the spoken word because Adam was a minor God he lost the right to the tree of life and now the Tree of Life they can't eat of it and it's guarded it's it's got Angels guarding it with a sword so now if God had Angels guarding it with a sword in order to return back he's got to have another angel with a sword bringing us back and this time not guarding it saying come on back to the word it's the word of God the word of God is our absolute that is God's Plum line that is what you need man should not live by bread alone but by every word in this Prophet every sermon it's back to the word it's back to what God said this is God's blueprint somebody say [Applause] amen he said never back to a church never back to a Creed never back to a Dogma never back to Seminary school he said back to thus sayith the [Applause] Lord prise God thank you Lord that's true Tree of Life taken from them they could not eat of it but God rich in Mercy has got a plan to bring it back Hallelujah are you interested tell me my inheritance I I guarantee it if you were there and the executive said okay here's what's in the whe you have to identify yourself and you have to say I want it because if you I don't care huh you ain't getting it legally you ain't getting it you have to want it so it is also with your Eternal inheritance from God if you're not that interested in it you ain't going to get it how many of you is interested I'm here tell me my inheritance yeah I want everything the daddy left for me if it's mine my name's on it I claim it every jot every CH every Landmark don't you move my Landmark I want what's mine amen amen so if we see in Genesis 3 it was guarded there has to be somewhere in the Bible where he brings it back so Revelations 2 and7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith un the churches to him that overcome Overcomers are you listening will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God hallelujah Revelation 22:14 blessed are they that do his Commandments amen that they may have right to the Tree of Life understand it's your right somebody say it's my right you got to claim it it's my right give to me my inheritance that's [Applause] mine that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city now let's look what the prophet of God said about this earnestly contending for the face 1953 God put a cherubim angel with a flaming sword around the tree to protect that tree of life that's right God used a cherubim with a flaming sword guarded it see it was an angel with a sword that guarded the Tree of Life man lost his right to the Tree of Life in Genesis 3 so it's got to be an angel to open the way back amen but he takes an I want to ask you which is greater an angel in the Pulpit or an angel in heaven he said the angel on Earth and do you understand that this seventh angel could even drive back the cherubims and say I am here to bring back the Tree of Life to every Overcomer to him that overcometh every age is given a promise to him that overcome you've got things overcome in this age quit being a a loser and one that under goes everything I'm undergoing this I'm undergoing that why I don't know why this happened to me undergo undergo no you are an overcomer tell the devil I'm an [Applause] overcomer went into the enemy camp and I took back what he took from me let it be more than a song huh amen all right man lost his right to the Tree of Life in Genesis 3 an angel with a sword guarded it so he has to reverse it he sent an angel messenger in this day what do you think he was doing in Sabino Canyon yeah amen he said this wasn't a king sword it was the king sword he said you all know what it is it's the word of God and the word of God is now placed in his hand he thought he's going to die that's right he said well nobody can live through a blast like that told his wife of probably not coming home he come down after that sword plac his hand I'm not going to die amen he said it's a furtherance of my Ministry amen hallelujah are you understanding it Angel driving the people back to the Tree of Life Away from Creeds away from dogmas away from religion away from the great Harlot away from all of those teachings that's bringing the World Council of churches together this Angel is driving them back to the absolute of God's word watch this earnestly contending for the faith wants delivered to the Saints 53 now in that day God guarded the tree to keep them from getting it and now that sword's turned right back the other way now running them right into the tree so that they will receive the life driving people hurting them into or up to the Tree of Life how marvelous this prophet of God was driving the people bringing them back it's not me doing these works it's him I'm just a voice that God is using I'm telling you think I have anything to do with it I'm no more than a Voice Hallelujah he kept telling us get back to the word get back to the word it is written it is written he this what about God he's not three Gods he's one God what is the correct baptism not father son Holy Ghost it's Lord Jesus Christ but guess what it's only revealed to the elect amen driving hurting them back to the tree of life amen let's look at what the prophet of God said about Adam losing the title deed 1961 Revelation 5 he just controls the world he said they were his is and he's the god of the world Jesus said he was and he is he's the God of this Earth how many know he was kicked out of heaven and this became his domain that's why when he said why if you'll sit down and worship me I'll give you the kingdoms of this world Jesus said my kingdoms not of this world why I'm going to change it has blinded the eyes of the people the God of this Earth he's he's the god of heaven and now he rightly don't own this he doesn't own it talking about the earth now remember the title deed of redemption and the title deed to the Earth and eternal life and add Adam forfeited the title deed to it to this and all this stuff that we own eternal life and the inheriting of the earth Jesus said in Matthew Matthew 5 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth now we don't have it now and it wasn't to Adam or any of his seeds Adam's seed absolutely lost everything it's not the seed of Adam no matter how much we try to beautify this world how much we try to make big fine homes and things it still doesn't belong to Adam's seed no sir it's not to go to Adam's seed no sir because Satan took it locked stuck and Barrel right for Adam forfeited it now now if we stopped right there we would be pretty sad-faced people huh we would oh man there who's worthy to take the book who's worthy Revelation chapter 5 paragraph 161 now our kinsman redeemer has handed the seven sealed book of redemption wow look at look at what he calls this book and I saw one sitting upon the throne who had his he had a book in his right hand I said who's worthy to take the book Revelation chapter 5 and there was absolutely no one in heaven or on Earth and John began to weep yeah Redemption is gone man is forever doomed and John began to walk away weeping with his head down he said cry not weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and I John turned to look to see a lion and I saw a lamb having been slain before the foundation of the world thank you Lord the same lamb that was provided as a Sacrifice by Abel comes down in another time and is said by John the Baptist to the people Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world Behold the Lamb they didn't know but just a few days later he's going to be crucified he's going to be smitten of God we turned as it were our faces away from him he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace thank you Lord Brother John yoro Who Am I who am I that a king would bleed and die for you talk about The Great Exchange I gave him my old tattered garment he gave me a robe of pure w yes I'm feasting on spiritual mana and that's why I'm singing tonight I love [Applause] you oh God who am I excuse me I get a little overcome Revelation chapter 5 now our Kinsman is handed the seven seal book of redemption from the original owner when we lost it at the Garden of Eden through Adam it went back to the original owner but there's been a poacher on the land a squatter and that's Satan he come over he's a poacher this Earth don't belong to him belongs to God but he's a poacher he's a squatter remember he was cast down to the Earth but he wasn't given possession of it he's a squatter you realize in this our day how many people are moving into somewhere and they're squatting there and saying squatter's rights have got more rights than the people that own it well thank God they're kicking out all these squatters yeah what would you do if you came home all of a sudden you had two or three families living in your home yeah yeah well thank you just keep paying the bills cuz I live here now uh-huh Cuz I'm going to squat on the squatter oh yeah anyway it's a title deed of our Redemption the seven seal book it's title D two parts of redemption Calvary the lamb being slain but now this book has got to be claimed and who claims it the lamb look at this the lamb and he claims the book what is he doing he is providing a way the second Adam is returning us back to everything the first Adam lost oh my goodness he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he's the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it his it goes back to the people wow thank you lordu in the breach 63 its Redemption meant all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my what that ought to do to a born again Christian is legal possession to the abstract deed title of eternal life means you possess everything that Adam and Eve [Applause] lost oh yeah I know you got trials and tribulations and you but you know what listen anything that's worth having you got to fight for it right so Satan he just there to just you know he wants to squat on all of your possessions your joy your happiness you know I don't want to fight for you know I I just want God to give me eternal life I want to be in the bride I want to sit with him on the throne and I want to do all this stuff but I don't want any trials you know I don't like Ro come on now and I counsel of thee to buy of me gold tried to fire brother brandom said that is the gold that is given to you the by the fiery Trials of tribulations and the things you go through wow you're not getting out of here without character it's the only thing you take with you that car the house you ain't taking none of it with you why you put so much emphasis on it only one thing that you're taking out of here with you it's your character so what do we work on when we come to church the character I didn't know I needed so much character any of you ever pray for patience what do you get trials I've quit praying I no I got enough patience Lord I'm good I got it I used to say Lord give me patience but hurry I don't pray for it anymore now here's where I'm this is the direction that I'm going into and I'm going to try to look at this stuff because this is good this is good stuff like Daniel Andy this is good stuff hey any of you ever like good stuff even in the world if you had good music you shared it with your friend hey man here's a new album here's the Beatles here's the stones this is good stuff or even you know hey here's some new dope here's some this hey we got some good stuff man this is this is good stuff well I tell what I got some good stuff and just like I shared back when I had friends hey I got come on over I got some good stuff I'm telling you come on over I want to share I got some good stuff now Jesus said I come in the volume of the book this is going to get good amen I looked up the word volume in both Hebrew and Greek it actually means in the portion of the scripture that was written for you I want to know my volume of the book what chapter am I in what portion do I play because I I want to show you look at what Jesus does when he enters his Ministry now he's been on Earth for a half hour of Silence 30 years you understand 30 years of Silence don't you know that I must be about my father's business but a priest in the Old Testament could not become a levitical priest until he's 30 years of age he now comes to the temple Luke 4:1 17- 21 follow along with me and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaas and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach the Deliverance of the cap to the captives recovering of sight to the Blind and set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book he said there would be 2,000 years separating from the acceptable year to the day of Vengeance right yes so he knew right where I'm going to come in the volume of the book I'm going to show you right where I'm at I'm going to show you my Ministry yes amen and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say to them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears that was the chapter or the volume of the book that spoke of his ministry he found the scripture pertaining to his own Ministry Spirit of the Lord was upon David and he he it was Christ it was the Christ of God the anointing of God that came upon him and David says in the Book of Psalms and lo I come in the volume of the book yes he's saying the exact words that Christ later says right the anointing watch this the anointing was causing him yes to play his part am Psalms 40: 6-8 sacrifice and offering thou did not desire mine ears hast thou open burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not [Applause] required then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me I Delight to do thy will oh God yay thy law is written within my heart amen now watch this he comes in the volume of the book so he finds the part he is to play and that's my delight because when you know you part you play your part my delight is to do thy will praise the Lord yes listen I love this message I love being a Christian amen it's not so hard amen now why do people make it so hard to be a Christian I thank God I'm not like these people out there you just read five minutes of news of what's going on and you're going to hey you know what you're going to have a heart attack you're going to need pills to go to sleep you're going to need pills to go to stay awake you're going to be starting to lose your mind you're going to think in all of the news that you see on any of the stations there's nothing nice it used to be that once in a while you you know somebody had a birthday and they had a big party and everybody loved the guy and then he died or whatever or a a dog had puppies everybody loves a puppy you guys like a puppy I do am I read the the news for about 5 10 minutes and I go done had my poison for the day now let's go open Sandy the good news hallu I better have an antidote to what I just took because that stuff would just drive you crazy no wonder the be neurotic so he says lo I come to the volume of the books is written of me I Delight to do thy will oh God yay the law is written within my heart identifying his own Ministry for the word is a compass it is a lamp under our feet Heaven and Earth have pass away but my word will never pass away amen so let me just say a few things here our Bible is not only a book of history of what has happened but it's a book foretelling future events and the reason we're hearing all of these things that are happening and all this news that's going on is because scripture must be fulfilled when you hear of wars and rumors of wars because the scripture must be fulfilled Nations shall rise against Nation the scripture must be fulfilled false prophets false teachers Rising seducers waxing worse and worse the scripture must be fulfilled gender identity is such a problem today yeah are you kidding me you see when Eve came to Adam he said you're woman right right your identity comes from the one who you come from you're a woman you're a man you're a woman you're a man if you want to know what gender you are ask him otherwise oh let me see I remember I I I told you I was flying through Australia here a couple years ago and you know you you have to change Terminals and you go through uh extra security and you get over here and there's two lines and they're checking bags again before you even get into the seating area all I want to do is go sit down I've got my boarding pass I'm ready to go and they and I come up here and uh you know there's two lines so I quickly am reading I look up which line is shorter I'll get in the shorter line oh somebody Taps me on the shoulder uh excuse me you're in the wrong line and it's all women I felt so silly but then I thought Bing well you know today I want to be a woman you know what they did I said no I'm just joking I went over there every just try to move me out of this L today I identify just for a few moments until I sit down I'm a woman people are crazy you get your identity from who you were made from that's why the only ones brother renom said as a he says I like a man to be a man I like a woman to be a woman he says why today there's so much perversion and stuff he said I was on a bus I think it was and he said I had this one sitting next to me welding goggles on and dirty overalls and different things like that and brother R said I told a joke and he slapped the leg or the knee of the person next to him and he said the discernment in his hand woman you ever you ever seen some of them you can't tell he couldn't tell is that joke now now listen we we can really think it's a joke can't we about gender identity but they're trying to tell our young children such perverted lies okay but watch this okay God is sending you a message that has for you even your gender identity a man be a man a woman be a woman amen all right all right now why is all this happening the Bible says 2 Thessalonians 2 11 and 12 and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie wow I think they all work for MSN that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness now I want to ask you who gave them strong delusion God did God is allowing these people to have reprobate Minds strong delusion so that they'll be leave Al lie and be damned I'm sorry what the Bible says in other words God who is the author wrote the script and he said that the scripture might be fulfilled now let me show you another portion of scripture Romans 1: 21-32 because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations their foolish heart was dark and professing themselves to be wise they became fools educated idiots so wise with knowledge they become fools right and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like a corruptible man Birds four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to what God did watch what God does because these guys they get so far out I'm going to turn over to an uncleanness through the lust of their own desire their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves watch he said I'm going to I'm going to turn them over who changed the truth of God to a lie and worshiped and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up to vile affections even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men well he covers all the bases women you're going to start liking one another men leaving the natural use of the woman what happened in the days of Sodom you remember lot says hey you can have take my two daughters there's virgins do with them what you want you can have them how would you like your daddy to give you away like that and you know what they said we don't want the women give us the men such a Sodom perversion so watch this leaving the natural use of the woman burned their lust one towards another men with men working which that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their ER which was me and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient you you want to see the vast majority of people out here that's ruling our country and the politics and and everything Hey listen this election ain't going to turn America around don't put your trust in any of this world politics America's going down it's thus sayith the Lord she's over it's history I'm sorry young people I'd love to see America come back and be what it was it ain't no way ain't going to happen brother Brenham said go go back and look in the early 60s he said they've got these voting machines that are corrupted they said you vote for one and it changes the vote to another he said they're going to do it yeah so I don't put no trust in any any kind of voting and all of the kind I took one vote that's the only one that really counts how many of you say I took a vote for Jesus Christ amen that's the one that I that I I I'm not neither Democrat nor Republican hey because they're both corrupt amen now you have to guess between the lesser of two evils who you vote for I I already voted amen amen now watch this now watch that the scripture must be fulfilled Jesus identifies this in St John 19 three different times in one chapter and they said therefore among themselves let us not Rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be now those are the Roman soldiers who are taking the Garment of Jesus that the scripture might be fulfilled they don't know their fulfilling scripture neither do these reprobates they don't know but the scripture must be fulfilled which saith they parted my reignment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did these things therefore why cuz it was written in the word okay that the scripture be fulfilled John 19: 28 after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirst he's on the cross he does that because he knows the scripture must be fulfilled 19:36 and these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken see all of this must be fulfilled the scripture must be fulfilled listen if the furnace of laiaa is seven times hotter right liken onto the time of the three Hebrew children then there must be a people like Shadrach meach and abendigo that will not bow we saw them what about us if there's a people that will take the mark of the beast then there must be a people who will take this seal of [Applause] God one takes a mark of the beast the other takes the Seal of God the vice versa if the kingdoms of this world are all falling apart there must be a kingdom that is coming that shall not fall apart whose kingdom cannot be shook amen thank God I'm not going to inherit this world that's right he's going to burn it over renovate it as much as how beautiful this Earth is now go up into the mountains you look in the Majestic forest and the blue skies and you get out there and really and the oceans and there is beauty that our eyes behold here but if you think it's pretty now what will it be like when he renovates it all I know is I want to be there there are those who were turned over to their own fleshly desires then there must be a people whom God has turned over to the very mind of Christ that they might fulfill his desires are you following me that the scripture might be fulfilled if there is a natural monetary system that is failing and the whole thing is falling apart and it's based on a gold standard then there has got to be a spiritual monetary systems that's backed by a gold standard I counsel of thee to buy of me gold hey you guys want the real gold you need to buy right now yes it's not the one that's the natural gold spiritual gold that thou mayest be rich if there is a mother church that is rising up to bring forth a World Council of churches there must be a virgin bride that is rising on the scene that the seven Thunders are gathering them together for rapturing Faith yes amen do you see yes what is this seven sealed book of redemption what is it all about what does it mean the volume of the book the more they eat from the Tree of knowledge and brother Bram said science and education is the Devil's Bible he said the world is megga doing on knowledge and science isn't it amazing we've got more things now than we've ever had and yet things are worse now than they've ever

going to eat 1955 the ark it's again the sign of the end time he's talking about education they were great workers of metal they discovered how they could what they could do with metal look what they're doing with metal today I heard the the radio the other day making Steeler metal houses now they cut out all the timber practically so they're making them out of aluminum out of steel and so forth and great discoveries of education and great going on of Science and progress of science a sign of the end time look what science has done last few years oh my just the things that's done what is it nearing the end time a sign that all the Believers minister in the P should be preaching it with all the force they got showing to the people we're passing milestones and all things point to the end the scripture verse of God's Bible that we read and believe today is pointing to the end not much farther the great scientific world says the end is in sight another great milestone the Zodiac on the calendar and so forth and astronomy and everything says the end is in sight the pyramid says the end is in sight every great pointing Place says the end is in sight we're at the end of time somebody say amen amen musicians come so let me close with this because I want to launch off in the direction for next Sunday thank you Lord we quoted this from Psalms 40 vers 6 through 8 and lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me I Delight to do thy will oh God yay thy law is written within my heart is within my heart how many of you know that brother Brenham he said every time time he would take a Bible and let it just open freely every time go go read this he says every time that I would take a Bible in my hand and I would let it fall open it fell open to Joshua what God was doing was showing him I'm I'm going to be with you go look at he writes this in the fly leaf of his Bible he puts it in there any of you that have the footprints book I want you to go look and see in his own handwritings listen to what he says on the tape what God was doing was showing him the chapter the verse now you know what God is doing with us behold I sent unto you Elijah the prophet you know what that's my volume that's my verse but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel Brother s guess what that's me man that's me that's my volume that's my chapter that's that's the part that I am to play behold I send unto you Elijah what's he going to do to you huh is he just going to make you go to church uhuh no no no no you're missing it yes it's more than Church yes it's a relationship I'm going to bring you to the place where you're going to know the very secrets of God's Own Heart and that will be to do and Delight in God's will I love this message and it has not become hard for me yes I go through trials and yes I just like every one of you probably even more so but I have never looked upon this message as it's so hard it's so rough to follow I say father nevertheless not my will thine be done I Delight now watch Hebrews 10 and this I'm closing Hebrews 10: 5-10 wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrif ice and offering thou wouldest not but a body thou has prepared prepared me and burn offerings sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me they put the parentheses or you know the whatever you call those lines to do thy will oh God above when he saids sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither has thou pleas pleasure therein which are offered by the law then he said lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second you see the second Adam what he's doing right you see your Bible the first the Old Testament and the New Testament the Old Testament of the law put you in jail every one of you born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies but the New Testament brought forth a New Covenant the Lord so he comes in a volume of the book that's written of me I want all of you to understand that this message shows me what portion of of the word I am to play every one of you have a position in the body of Christ every one of you there is not a one of you that is without a position now some of you doctors and and nurses and different things you understand that the body is made up of many parts can the hand say to the foot I have no need of thee you guys know what adenoids are how about a thyroid you got a theid you know what you don't even realize what it does until it quits working then you get a goer right how about your appendix you ever seen your appendix don't even know what's there the little things that's why when the body starts getting out of kilter when one pos one one little part starts stops playing its position the body has to make up for it you ever you ever had your toe get real sore and the rest of your body does this oh what are you doing huh even when you put your sock on you Ginger you sit there and you rub that little toe oh bless you oh man you got to get better man you hey and you never pay no attention in fact 90% of the time you never see it you put shoes on never even look at your toes but they're there but when you stub it one time you're going to know ah then you cherish that little member right every one of you have a part to play in the in the body doesn't matter if you're a housewife a cook you're an accountant everyone of you have a part to play but you've got to find out what is the volume of the book for you what part do you play brother Bram said listen we all need to know our part and the only way it's revealed to us is when the Divine revealer comes and reveals to you your position in the body of Christ cuz otherwise you don't have a clue you're like most of the even most of the the young people that are now going to college do you know how often they change their major about every other semester because they don't know what they want to be they want to be a professional student well I just keep going to school and the more they eat from the science and education I'm not against Hey listen some of you hey it's good praise the Lord but I wonder if that education that you're getting how how does it line up to God's word it's okay I I want you to be successful ful I want you to do well and I'll tell you what in this age that we're in now if you don't have a high school diploma then you better be a real good ditch digger or a real huh yeah nothing wrong with digging ditches no sir let me tell you when you need to dig a ditch dug you want somebody that's going to do it and do it right huh you don't want to see this thing here and up and down there's nothing wrong with manual labor some of you are destined to be manual labors it's true there is no shame in manual labor I will say this the Bible says that the Working Man [Music] that his sleep is sweet CU you know what brother Ralph when we were young men we'd go to work for the boss in fact brother Mike is here brother Mike one of my first bosses yeah man I'm a surfer from California I don't know a 2x4 from a [Music] 2x6 ah what trials we must have put those guys through one thing about it as we learn to work and give a good days work for the wage you got very few people know how to work today nothing wrong what was nice that Ralph I am picking on Ralph cuz we knew him we before we got married huh Chris before we all got married bunch of young kids but you know what was nice brother Mike when I got done at the end of the day I took that tool belt off put it in my toolbox put it up and I don't have to think about work till tomorrow you know who had a headache that guy right over there hey what job we going to tomorrow brother Mike well I I got a job over here okay I never thought about it I never worried about it and I my phone wasn't ringing at night that man's the one who had all the headaches come on how many I want to own my own company yeah yeah you sure you do and I hope you get employees that are just the same kind of employee you are that don't want to work anyway I love this message Saints and I'm proud to be identified with it I don't have to defend it I don't have to tell you what's right and what's wrong I just got to preach the word of God cuz you know what if I convince you that it's right somebody will come along and if they're a stronger sophist do you know what a sophist is somebody who likes to debate somebody who takes just the opposite of what you say all the time and if somebody is a greater stronger opinion they can talk you out of what you are I had I had two prophets in my church back in Texas watch this two prophets they came to me one started growing a beard like Jonathan up here got a beard hey man why you got a beard you a prophet now watch this I'm not picking on you you like a beard grow a beard that's fine so this one brother I noticed he's growing a beard he come up to me one one day after church he said Hey brother Ron you know why I'm growing my beard I said no why I'm a prophet he said you know what Joseph brandham the other day shaved off his beard and he said the spirit went from Joseph br him to me now I'm I'm the prophet oh you are you're the prophet yeah I just want you to know I just want you to know I'm might have come stomping out of the Wilderness one day this was a serious man in my church got a nice little family wife with a couple kids man so he tells me he's a prophet okay so I'm watching him okay well then I have another guy that he talks to this first prophet and he and he says well what why you growing a beer well I'm a prophet now because you know I'm going to have to come he said you ain't the prophet I'm the prophet now this first prophet I'm going to tell you how far he went the Bible says Thy word is a lamp under my feet this guy was a genius on how he could invent things you know Aaron's Rod he made Aaron's Rod he made it so many cubits he put seven colors of the rainbow on it he put a pyramid with gold leaf at the top he had LED lights around it he hooked it up do you remember the Walkman you remember the first Walkman you could a little cassette player he hooked it there and so and he made he he had a robe his wife made him a robe and so after work he'd put his robe on put his hood on and he'd walk at night with eron's Rod with a pyramid at the top and brother bram's voice when he says good evening friends the lights would light up on the LED and he could walk good evening friends I greet you the word is a lamp under my feet do you see what I'm saying and he would do this and he' listen to all the tapes of brother brandham oh wow I'm the prophet I'm I'm probably Moses I'm going to be the one to go to Israel now these guys are sincere man you don't you don't joke with them they're sincere one guy said you can't be Moses I'm Moses he said I'll tell you another thing he says you know what you can't be that Prophet um because I'm that Prophet so now the second prophet convinces the first one no you ain't that Prophet I'm the prophet so he said take Aaron's Rod take the cloak take the pyramid take all this stuff and make a bonfire and put all this stuff in the fire so they do they they go and make a bonfire do you know what happens to a batter when you put it in a fire now you can think this is funny you guys know what a a pocket New Testament is the little tiny small Bible just Matthew through Revelation so the second prophet has got a New Testament Bible in his pocket they're sitting around the the fire watching all of this Burn Right all of a sudden man Sparks go all over and a big old amember comes out hits this brother right here on the pocket and the thing that saved him was the pocket Bible see brother the devil come right out of the fire but the word stop I mean listen it just got so far out so what happened to the first prophet he said you know what I think I'm a poet so he started writing uh Shakespearean Pro Pros any of you take a English Shakespearean pros and where do they wind up Saints they all hit the ditch they get somebody to maybe believe a little something let me tell you you think and if I'm just one one little guy who's been around just a little bit and I take a guy like Johnny Green Johnny I'm sure you've met a few of these guys yourself and anybody that's been in this message long enough you know what travel around a little bit you're going to find them they're in every country I just thank God that I've got the revelation of who the prophet is who's the prophet of this age and that he preaches and he tells me what position I play in the body of Christ actually it's the holy spirit that reveals it to me amen God bless you all thank you for coming to the house of God this morning my greatest desire is to see each one of you know your position in the body of Christ it's revealed to you by the Holy Spirit we can preach it to you but you have to have the Holy Spirit see it says the spirit has said unto me I will do the volume and I will show you my will and I will have Delight in doing it praise the Lord God bless you thank you Lord don't you love [Music] me yeah I've had my trials I've had my tribulations I've had my times and I've had my times when I'm so disappointed and discouraged by the people that call themselves message Believers that I thought I got right to the point well if that's the bride of Christ if those are the Elite if that's the elect I'm ready and my anchor [Music] holds hey what did Barry coffee son say people will be people don't forget that Saints people will be people wow like it's a mind-blowing revelation no you get around people long enough be around and you know what somebody will disappoint you somebody will say evil about you somebody will this and that and you know what if your foundation is upon on a man when the man falls you fall with a man but if your foundation is upon the rock of the revelation of Jesus [Music] Christ ain't nothing taking you down oh yeah I I would have probably given up a long time ago had I not had a revelation I mean I look at just a few of my oldtime friends that are around here Ralph Chris as an example hey we've seen a lot coming [Music] go huh brother Mike you too brother Bobby of course in fact your former Pastor over there in shreport I think it was do you know when brother Bram said you know they were looking to come get me to take me to the meetings and I was going to go have breakfast with them and brother BR and you know what uh they were coming to tell brother brandham not they don't want him to come preach their church anymore but they couldn't find him they were given the wrong room address or room number and brother Brenham is laughing telling the story and doesn't even know that the reason they were sent to him they were going to tell him don't come anymore because God had to have that Prophet preach those Services amen God watched over the prophet he would have killed himself a couple times can't handle the pressure [Music] hope I'm going see you in just a few moments Sharon Rose I can't take it no longer takes the glove off he said what it 30,000 volts or something up there he said all I got to do is reach up and touch it he said the next thing I find myself who got him off the [Music] pool why didn't he die he was going to do it y he takes a gun puts it to his Temple oh I'm sorry I look I go through my whole house and everywhere I see I see reminders of my sweetheart and I can't handle it I hope I'm going to see you in just a minute puts it there snap puts it again snap snap I can't even kill myself he throws the gun down boom why because you who had to have heard the voice of the seventh angel messenger god watched over his gift so he could pick up your gift because there had to be somebody in the day of the voice of the seventh angel and when he should begin to sound the mystery and guess what you're a part of it you're part of the mystery that God is unfolding in this end time you're a part of it thank you Lord
