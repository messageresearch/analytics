of sickness so so let's continue to remember our pastor in prayer and just hold him up this morning um several weeks or several months ago uh sister Sharon Van white of the lefant leontine family back in Ohio had requested prayer she was battling cancer and going through treatments and she sent us a text last night and she just wants to thank the Lord that her last pet scan of December 1st showed

bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord what an honor and a privilege it is to be in your house and Lord where you are there is Liberty there is Lord Freedom there is healing there is virtues there is life Lord and so we're asking this morning for Life father and for that life abundantly like your word says we heard the testimony this morning here of the healing of cancer Lord your Prophet said that if the people would believe that not even cancer would stand in their ways and so we're asking Lord May our faith arise may you help us Lord in our unbelief that we might believe that all things are possible for they are to those who would believe we pray for the needs that's within our body Lord many are sickly many are at home not feeling good Lord and father God you know each and every one we're asking now that you would meet it according to your word Lord father we have joined ourselves together and come here Lord that we might hear of you and so we're asking that your word would come forth and that it would uh fulfill its intent and purpose in our lives Lord may you bring us up a little high higher father than what we were when we came bless your people we pray be with our pastor Lord give them a Special Touch in body and in mind father may your angels Lord Minister onto him in a special way may you Lord just send the the angel with the softest hands Lord may you rub his brow Lord may you comfort him father and father raise him up and restore onto his health we're ask asking these things for thy Kingdom's Glory now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you may be seated this morning certainly glad to be home and um I was just thinking on my way to church there this morning it's been since the middle of November I guess since the last time I was in church I almost feel like a backslider here at home and uh just to give a little update on our our trip we're we're all almost home uh brother Amos is in LAX right now he went to uh New Zealand to visit brother Chris mther and Cher there for a little bit and so he's on his way home he's had a couple of delayed flights and um the brother Gabe Harris he was in um Australia visiting his sister and stuff but his grandma passed away and so he had to cut his trip short and he flew to Texas for his grandma's funeral and stuff there so just keep them in your prayers um the rest of us were all home but as you can tell uh we're a little under the weather and so I guess it's just all part of it isn't it and um we had a really good Services over there in vatu uh we had nine Services total I believe it was and uh the Lord just did Mighty things and um Saturday morning brother James preached and brother Ron told him cast The Net James cast The Net so we cast the net and all of a sudden one person came forward and you can tell this gentleman was uh extremely broken in his Spirit just before the Lord and another one came forward and another one came forward and brother Ron made a a little bit more of a call from behind the pulpit and next thing we know we're having a prayer line and man every single man woman boy and girl whoever could walk was going through that prayer line and uh I think we prayed for over 400 people on Friday morning on uh yeah I think it was Friday Saturday morning there and the Lord just moved in a very special way and um out of the people that came forward there was 12 that gave their lives to Jesus Christ got baptized and uh and that's what it's all about yeah give the Lord a hand clap of Praise yeah so brother James he got to do his first baptisms and stuff there on the ocean it was just so it was just beautiful a very beautiful scene and um and so as you all know uh brother Ron got sick over there and um you know he said as they were coming through the prayer lines little kids you put your hand up their heads and they're just burning up with fever just burning up and um pretty much right after the service he lost his voice and so he was only able to preach one service over there really and um and so as the days went on you know his condition got a little bit worse and a little bit worse as it does and and brother Jerry you know is brother Jerry here this morning I don't think he is is he he shouldn't be anyways probably the second day we were there brother Jerry got sick and and um he did everything he could just to make it home and and so we're trusting for the Lord to really touch brother Jerry this morning also um but brother Ron came home uh real deep chesty cough and um you know he suffered it for two days you know how brother Ron is he's he he's a bu old dog he'll suffer through these things but early Friday morning sister Sandy took him into the hospital and um sure enough you know he he had pneumonia influenza uh dehydrated you know all of the above and so they're keeping them in there three or 4 days to get them rehydrated and get the pneumonia taken care of and different things he wanted to preach this morning we were on our way home I was flying with brother J and brother Ron I said brother Jerry brother Ron I'm already scheduled for Wednesday night just trade me Services I'll take Sunday you take Wednesday and he said ah we'll see and it's because of his love for the Sheep but our love for brother Ron is brother Ron get healthy it's okay so brother Ron we know you're watching please get healthy amen and so he's in the right right place right now he's getting hydrated he's getting the care that he needs and the Lord willing here within the next one or two days he'll be out of the hospital and uh back on his feet again so we just want to and I just want to say um you know let's try not to bombard brother Ron with text messages and asking him questions and stuff let's just give him this time to relax give him this time to recover and not have to worry about answering questions and things if if you if there is a need within the body brother uh micheel Loval our head Deacon he's always available brother Robert mcari is available and uh you know these brothers can can answer any questions and take care of any situations that you might need help with okay praise the Lord so we have brother Paul halet here this morning he's going to preach with us and I was just so so thankful uh that he is in town because if he wasn't here I would have to take the service and you would have to suffer with me while I suffer and uh and we don't need that so we're excited for the word this morning and we're asking that brother Paul just take his Liberty preach what God has placed on his heart he he's no stranger amongst us so I know that we're going to have a really good time this morning God bless you richly Amen brother the more amen thank you brother Steven I have a number of announcements here

say after that right I preached a sermon right there my my my how many's thankful for God's love before there ever was a specka stardust you and me were in his thoughts on his mind in his heart that's the best part right he had is right here that soft spot you know how many brothers have a wife that you're thankful for that loves God and prayer Warrior yeah one that you can have fellowship with and talk about the things of God and young men I want to challenge you that if you are looking be patient I tell you there's nothing like that that Fellowship you can sit with your wife and talk about the word and this morning had a couple things on my heart but you know Mary did you know is a song that around this time of the year is just one of my favorites right I just can't help but saying it over and over and over again but the other day other evening we were visiting my wife dropped a profound thought on me that I have just not been able to get away from she said if you thought about Mary's [Music] mother I said huh she said would No Angel come to her but yet she raised a daughter yeah Mary's mama I thought what did Brother brandham say about Mary's mama and I could only find one place where brother brandom talked about her and maybe there's other places that he did but I I found one place and he called her Anna and it was in a message called Mary's belief preached right here in Phoenix in 1960 and the little portion of that drama that he is telling he says and Anna he talks about Joseph how perfect Joseph was in his thinking and his way doing thing he said he said Joseph and Mary were his spouse and they were sitting on the porch of Anna's home and they were looking across the street where Joseph was building a house for him and Mary to dwell and and the carpenter shop in the back and he said how everything was perfect in Joseph's mind he wanted everything to be just right he said a little heart carved in the gate he said just to represent the love that he had for Mary and and he goes on he said but then he said as Joseph and Mary were fellowshipping there on the porch he said Anna come out the door and handed Joseph the the book of Isaiah brother brandom says and he said Joseph unrolls the scroll and he begin to read where a virgin shall [Music] conceive Anna did you know I just haven't been able to get away from that I'm like you know there was no angel no Gabriel come to her but yet she believed God word and that's all it takes right it's all it takes Mary did you [Music] know would someday walk on water Mary did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters did you know that your baby boy would make you new and this child that you deliver guess what he'll soon deliver you Mary did you know your baby boy will give sight to the blind man Mary did you know that your baby boy would calm a storm with his hands and did you know that your baby boy has walked Where Angels TR and when you kiss your little baby oh you've kissed the face of God Mary Did You [Music] Know The Blind will see the de will hear the dead will live again the lame will Le the some will speak the Praises of the [Music] [Applause] [Music] land Mary did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation Mary did you know that your baby boy would one day rule the Nations did you know that your baby boy is Heaven's perfect lamb and that sleeping child your holding is the great High [Music] thank [Applause] [Music] you thank you brother James how many can say like Mary said so many years ago be it unto me according to Thy word amen thinking of the song let your word be born in the manger of my heart it's all stands we prepare to change the order of the service you all of all of Christendom has got the little baby in the manger and I'm thankful that he did come but I'm thankful that he lived to die he resurrected and he lives within my heart this morning this is my heart's cry let your word be born in the manger of my heart was a tiny simple stable all beaten and warn hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty so I know if I give him control he'll be born in me let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it St live inside this house of clay and mold it every day oh let your word be born in the manger of my heart will outwardly I'm nothing not much to behold unlikely place for his word to unfold but if I'll just yield this vessel and let him have his way from Glory unto Glory he'll change me day by day let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let your word be born in the manger of sing it one more time let your word be born in the manger of My Heart Lord let it let it St live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let your word be born in the manger of my [Music] heart I almost feel this morning that other when we know that our purpose to be here is for the preaching of the word but I almost feel like the atmosphere that's here the songs that have been sung we could almost just say amen and go home amen I was thinking as our sisters were singing you know the beauty of how it comes down in the word of God Satan sewing his seeds of doubt and fear and anxieties do I have the Holy Ghost am I saved this that and the other that he throws and I love how God uses a prophet's voice to settle or calb the water of our life and he says you know you can't be deceived that's right because you are the word aren't you thankful God would come and let his word be born in the manger of our hearts amen that it would come so strongly and anchor Us in this day amen we could look back I remember a brother one time telling me Oh he I would just have loved I would have loved to lived and he named an age in the church ages he said I would have loved to have lived in that age and then he paused and he said well well not as much as I love to live in this age we live in Leo deia the devil he Sly isn't he but we've already won the victory we're not sitting here this morning striving for victory let me put it this way we are Victory this morning in Jesus Christ amen I just want to bring you Greetings From Grace Tabernacle and all the saints there in Idaho amen uh hope you don't mind I'm just a little warped not too warped but a little I I'm very feel a privileged to be here this morning but I'll be honest with you I I was in great anticipation of hearing brother Ron share about the trip to Batu and all that God would do there you know if you've followed that through the years and you have you're you're the church here God always does something Supernatural when brother Ron goes to vanatu there's always something in incredible that happens and and I'm here by forfeit brother Ron can't preach this morning brother Steven's not feeling well so I am your substitute and you know how substitute teachers are you tolerate them but you never fully embrace them but this morning I I just trust that you won't listen to brother Paul you'll just listen to the word of God and I trust it's been my heart I've prayed over this and I don't know why I feel nervous this morning sister Jerry's always saying well I know when you're nervous and I'm like how do you know and your voice squeaks and um so I hope you don't hear Too Much squeaking this morning amen let's turn in our Bibles this morning Amen to First Corinthians I want to speak to you on God's power to perfect amen and we look at this and realize if we don't have a security we don't have peace then as we'll read through the word of God we'll find ourselves at odds we'll say well I I I don't feel like I reached this or I've attained to this place but yet we'll come to another passage of scripture we'll come to another time that the prophet speaks and we have with an absolute certainty in our hearts we are Sons and Daughters of God filled with the Holy Ghost amen with the power to overcome this world now it all comes down to what voice you listen to the one that's inside this skull here or the word of God Amen and we listen to oursel my brother and sister and it never causes it always causes you to to have a problem I'm just going to throw my little niece Beth Beth under the bus you know she had just been down to Idaho to visit us and they had quite a bit of snow fall in Alaska and the snow falling off the roof and she I guess it's a family tradition and and you can judge whether that's a good tradition or not but she climbed up on the front porch rail which is quite high and leaped off into the snow I've done this since I was a little kid only this time it breaks her back sometimes that voice in your head shouldn't be listened to you shouldn't get up there and say you know I've always done this it'll work out just fine the Lord knows listen to the word not the voice in your head amen hallelujah let's just turn to 1 Corinthians the 2 chapter verses 1-6 but we'll read down a bit here and um uh verse 6 and let you be seated this morning amen God's power to perfect and I Brethren when I come to you come not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ can we say Amen to that amen that's what we want amen and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power amen that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect you realize if we don't recognize our correct position you are perfect otherwise there's no wisdom in us at all we cannot manufacture wisdom but God says I'm going to speak H wisdom among them that are perfect Saints there's wisdom in the house today amen can we acknowledge that let's let's lift our voices real loud thank you Lord You Lord there's wisdom in the house today amen yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery yeah even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world and to our Glory Heavenly Father we thank you today just ask for your guiding hand Lord speak the word father Lord that it would be of benefit Lord a blessing to your people I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen am you may be seated goes on to say in verse 7 but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world and to our Glory so this is declaring this mystery is going to be revealed in our day amen isn't this wonderful we're no longer going to just look out there and see a mystery you'll see my brother and sister many ministers around the world in denomination Etc preaching of the Mysteries and and it draws us we receive a postcard once a year of a local church that has a mystery seminar and and they're there and and uh they're they're telling you that they are going to unfold the Mysteries well my brother and sister they're still speaking the same thing they started 10 years ago when they were going to reveal the mystery so either they already had the revelation of the mystery or they're still searching for it amen so as you look here now he says now none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I hath not Seen Nor Ear heard neither had enter into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him there's a lot of preparation been put into you Saints amen God has done a lot of preparation to reveal these things to you amen so it's there we look and see that it it's a what man would even know he has the spirit of man right which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God for now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of God Can someone say Amen that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God so we have a gift that has been given which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him and I'm going to just say something that might come across a little harsh and we'll tie together a little farther in the service my brother and sister when the word's revealed and you know this is a revealed word and you don't value it enough to act upon it on huh the word says that's iniquity now Les we get too concerned here today that iniquity this horrible thing Lord I'm falling apart I want to just throw this out so you'll be prepared for later my brother and sister every one of us this morning sitting in this building has a degree of iniquity in our life can someone agree with me there's many things we know to do that we do not do it's almost painful when you think about that Lord I I'm standing here speaking to the Bride of Jesus Christ with iniquity in my life yeah ouch you know that's what you say when it's painful not all the rest of those words ouch but you see God by his grace my brother and sister is working on our iniquity amen we're not leaving it to tend to itself but we have submitted it committed it to God and he is moving on our behalf but you got to remember we're not looking for man's Perfection we're looking for God's Perfection amen so you must do all things by the spirit because if you don't and look at the carnal man the carnal man will walk out of these doors today and never come back because you would say I don't measure up and I can't but if you look at the Spirit then it's not you that was drawn back to the house of God it was God drawing you amen we're here this morning because God loves you so much to draw you back to himself Amen Let me just jump to verse 16 for Heath known the mind but who known the mind of God that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ amen I would just encourage you right now just in your heart to say amen I have the mind of Christ amen if we have any other mind my brother and sister we're we're going to get confused amen I hope y'all don't mind I was raised on the farm my dad knew that boys that were too warm in the winter were lazy boys and my dad used to make us take our cat off cuz he says you can't work with a code on so I've carried that all through my life so I know that some of the brothers here can preach a whole inspired anointed Service never unbutton their jacket I don't know how they do it so if yall don't mind I'll just take my coat off so I can get down and work amen thank you brother Mark Hallelujah now I'm always amazed my brother and sister we have all kinds of critics in the world today and they're out here voicing their ideas of the message and their ideas of God but I always find it very interesting that people who can't even explain themselves are explaining God Amen well God surely meant this and God surely meant that well go ahead and tell me what is it that you are and where are you're standing and why you are where you are because after all you are the king of your domain and if you really have such a grasp of who you are then maybe you can move towards even trying to explain God but my brother and sister it's not our calling to explain God it's our calling to listen to the word of God and act on the word of God and then put the word of God on display amen many times people say well brother Paul I I need how can I defend the message I I have a coworker I have a friend I have this my brother and sister the prophet of God didn't say you're not not here to defend this message you're here to live it amen and your life will defend the message amen I say and this is something I've held for for many many years my brother and sister when brother Brandon was there Discerning hearts in the prayer lines and praying for people and people being healed and all of that and we'll look at that and we say there's a Vindication of this ministry prophecy being fulfilled and I don't want to be an anti but my brother and sister like I said I'm just a tad bit War but I look at this and I look at that and say you know what there are men in those days right we all know the story of how brother brandham brought that out in the public brother the God didn't want him to but brother brandom you know having compassion for the people and he lays that out and they are there but I'm telling you there's men who prayed for the sick and they were healed there were men who discerned hearts and that was correct there was Men Who prophesied and it came to pass but I tell you I believe all that don't misunderstand me I believe that but I tell you what I personally believe is the greater Vindication of the prophet's message is that he spoke of a people who would have been restored back to the word of people who had come and had received the father's message and they had received the Holy goals and they are sitting here this morning here is the Vindication that matters in leoda it's not what happened in 1955 1960 1965 but what's happening in 2023 and we are coming even to the end of this this year here's a Vindication now I know the devil never bothers you he never torments you he never throws Temptation or trials in your way that's right brother every single day why are you here yeah come on something keeps holding me every day you see Hallelujah my brother and sister you see God's got a power one thing I can say about hope y'all don't mind they take a drink I never do it the pulpit but you guys are dry down here I'm not talking about you spiritually church I'm talking about your your your Atmos no not even your atmosphere amen excuse me now we look here the Apostle Paul laying a very solid foundation for us can we say thank you Lord for the Apostle Paul amen that Foundation was so solid that even the prophet went back to that foundation and built as it were upon that brought Revelation to us now in the sermon the message Perfection 1957 brother brandham then speaks he says now God in the beginning required Perfection Jesus when he come up to Earth he said be perfect like God in heaven is perfect and the law having a shadow of things to come could never make the worshipper perfect you get the picture now let's go it again so you'll be sure not to miss it amen so that means somebody was probably going to miss it if the prophet didn't clarify that God requires perfect Holiness no one can stand in His image with one little speck of sin my brother and sister if you don't have a deeper Revelation then we should just get up and leave right cuz didn't we just pretty much all of us acknowledge we have some iniquity in our life and iniquity is sin now iniquity doesn't mean that it's something wicked or evil or something to be despised or uh looked down upon it can be be as simple I like to use this analogy CU it doesn't doesn't hurt anybody's feelings it could be just that we know we should take the trash out and we refuse to do it oh I was talking in your own life amen out come on Saints [Applause] out instead we could have some self-imposed law sisters come I've got a tape measure here in my pocket we're going to ma your shoes today that's nonsense isn't it we should be Beyond such things right we should be becoming mature into a perfect image of a bride of Christ not going back into legalistic or not being messaged churches that are now almost turning to the symbolism of Judaism to to maintain or present something I'm not against those things went to Israel this last year had a wonderful time but my brother and sister you see we're not called to go back we're called to go forward Amen to come into this Perfection of Jesus Christ by the preaching of the word amen so this perfecting amen God required Perfection and so if he requires perfect Holiness no one can stand in His image with one little speck of sin Jesus witnessed the same and said be perfect just like God in heaven is perfect and the Bible said that the law could never Oh you mean if we apply law Saints this is why those of you that know me well know my testimony go back a lot of years about 19 years old my first maybe 18 years old my first interactions with brother Ron there'd be some here brother Mike would be well beyond those years 40 some years ago but not boasting but I would say there's many of you wouldn't have known brother Ron 40 some years ago brother Ron's the same man today as he was then and he was the same man then as he is now a man who has striven his whole life to be balanced that's in character in nature oh I just CAU A vibe from the congregation yes he makes mistakes it's not making the mistake it's what you do once you have made the mistake run from God or run to him there's our choice I can stand here and feel fully qualified to those of you might be offended if I say about running from God CU at 15 I ran I become a runner but by God's grace and amazing we run big circles that's right cuz if you're the bride of Christ you can't get away you'll run run run run run run run run run and yes it even fits that song run with the message of Malachi 4 it never left me and I ran and I ran and I ran until I was too tired to run any further and finally I had to say Lord forgive me but you see a balanced message is an absolute prerequisite for rapturing faith we lean too far to the left lean too far to the right amen we'll be trusting in things or trusting in nothing so we have to have a balanced message and this balanced message will bring us to a place that the word of God then makes very clear sense to us it no longer be so and so said it will be God said you love your pastor but you see God in your pastor and it's God that we follow right amen so we look at this that the law could never with it sacrifice es make the com perfect then the law could not perfect anything it was only a pointer these sacrifices made every year could never make the worshipper perfect so therefore no one under the law or keeping of laws or under the shadows could be perfect pretty cut and dried isn't it pretty straightforward I think today we could lift a hand and say thank you Lord for there go I but the grace of God true now do you guys believe in homework my dear little sister you go to public school or home school or are you older than you look you see homework is just a part of life as kids we're like they gave us homework again again they don't like us my parents made me do the homework no one loves me but do you realize God requires homework yeah it's not what we do at church that matters my brother and sister it's what we do at home there's our homework and we have been given homework every single day so I'm just going to be totally presumptuous today if you don't mind cuz I will whether you mind or not but anyway I would encourage each one of you to go home and read 2 Corinthians 13 amen you know in this we'll look at this very strong words I think it's verse five or six very strong words know yourself don't sit here just I go to church I believe the message I was raised in the message so was I didn't do me a bit of good until I was in my 30s but you see we need to do our homework and we need to know ourself very good and if you find iniquity now my sermon is not about iniquity but if you find iniquity in there don't bury it expose it bring it to the surface and say Lord I need this out of my life amen you know I I used to as a young man have a very extensive collection of of VHS uh not VHS I mean um eight track um yes anyway I'm getting old sister Jerry brought up a word that should never be brought up in the presence of her husband and she said something about scile but you see if you don't know yourself then what is this word going to do for you you have to stop even as we take communion the scripture in Corinthians says examine yourself oh Lord let me be honest enough with myself today to look at my own life and say Lord I have shortcoming I have weakness here but here I believe with all of my heart and and oh Lord here I feel like I'm on on kind of equal footing on good footing but over here Lord I have I have a trouble with this am all right now I hate to even bring these things up but I want to drive the point home my brother and sister there'll be even many a young person or maybe old person in the assembly today there's a problem with music when I was a kid I had extensive collection of that I had a a a Pioneer High power the modern day Bo boom bo and I I hid it under the seat cushion I'm not giving you ideas I'll pray if it is in your mind and you do do that that God just exposes it but I hid it under the seat and the springs in my pickup and I went to church just like many of you do and you know why they invented all that hair gel is so backslid message kids can conb that long hair back over their head and it will stay there for a whole service and you walk out and you go down the road in The Same Spirit yes I think I spoke this at the church but it's been a little while since I've been here so I'll throw it out to you again you know brother Brown really didn't speak about rock and roll oh I imagine there might be young people heyen but you see Ro R would have been nothing if there hadn't been a spirit behind it this Bow Wow music that they've got now you say why do you call it bowwow because my brother in spirit it's a nothing but a bunch of hungry wolves that are bringing that music out hungering for the souls of people right you see it's a spirit behind it so when I say he didn't preach against rock and roll I want you to understand that you don't need to identify the actual individual thing that is the Affliction to our flesh that is the Affliction to our hearts and our minds and our souls because you just need to recognize the spirit that is there and you recognize the spirit Lord examine me am examine me Lord that every spirit that would be upon me whether it be a spirit of lust or Pride or or or whatever it is bitterness or whatever it might be Lord expose every Spirit come we say Amen Saints expose it Lord I want it out of my life I don't want to Harbor no safe place for the devil so you look at these things my brother and sister and we recognize what God is doing he's actually bringing us to know who we are can somebody tell you tell me who we are be bold we are the not a the Bride of Jesus Christ ultimately what we are sitting here today is for that Revelation to be anchored so deeply within our souls that Satan cannot dislodge it with any one of his tricks amen Revelations 19 one of my favorite chapters let's go to Luke 17 somebody out here please pray that brother Paul don't go on and on and on today and I don't say this for your sake I say it also for my sake amen Luke 17 would would would Saints would you just give me some just kind of be nice to me and lift a hand and say I'll do my homework amen I'll read that and I'll read it with an open heart and let the Lord speak to me amen it's a tremendous chapter Luke 17 I'm going to preach a story to you this morning if I can would that be all right no deep Mysteries this morning no deep things no tying this from the Old Testament all the way to here and this is here and this part this time no no just a simple story I want to preach to you and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he entered into a certain Village there met him 10 men that were lepers with stood AAR off now we know a leopard is one that's unclean he's Outcast he's separated and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed I think that's incredible didn't lay hands on them come on Amen now let's not come to the point that we think that there's no purpose for laying hands on there is but we're talking about in this circumstance they're unclean they're a far off Jesus does not break the custom right you'll never find him breaking the custom everything he says even from chasing them out of the temple was rooted in the word and so let me back up go show yourselves unto the priest so here here is a command that he gives to them and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God and fell down on his face at his feet giving giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan not an overly spiritualized man right you realize that's the Samaritans they were not overly spiritualized people now I'd embarrass somebody this morning if I said now how many of you think you're real spiritual right nothing wrong with that if you lifted a hand but I'll just be honest with you this morning I'm just a man sometimes I have to read the same verse in the Bible again and again and again and the whole time I'm reading it I'm saying Lord there's something here and I don't see it reveal this to me I need to I read a certain chapter we won't go into that but I read a certain chapter in the Bible for about 18 days straight my brother and sister I knew there was something there I couldn't find I'm not against those who read the Bible in a year that's good but I tell you if you're just thumbing through the verses and the page to get done in 365 days I think you're going to miss a lot amen I think if you're willing to stop and say all of the word is relevant to my life Lord reveal every drop of it but I don't understand this verse and Lord I'm going to keep coming back with a prayer a request a desire for this word to speak to me amen and when it speaks to you well it unlocks a lot of other scripture for you but my brother and sister anybody can speed read a book now those of you went to college you know I didn't go to college I we sister Jerry and I took some classes but you know um you you can read through a lot of those things if you understand the the context of what you're reading you can read it very quickly I used to take a novel and just in in a few hours read the whole novel but if somebody come back and says what did Bob do at this time Bob's not important I don't care what Bob did but the word's not that way right every portion of word is relevant to the believer so don't speed read your Bible read it with integrity and intent and absorb it amen amen and so he comes and he gives praise and Jesus says now here in verse 16 he fell down on his face and give thanks and he was a Samaritan Jesus answered and said were there not 10 cleansed where are the nine and they're not found that return to give glory to God save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith right has healed you that's right is that what it says it's a little bit tricky there because it does say it healed him but he had another I I'm not I'm not preaching at you Saints I'm preaching to people like you he had other complexes that were hiding in there he had other things in his life that were out of line out of balance come on and Jesus says you've been made whole amen that's right not just leprosy taking from him but things deep down in the conscious state that would have tormented had bothered had troubled had hindered had done all of these things and every drop of that was taken from him I'm telling you when God says you're whole my brother and sister you don't walk out with a complex you don't walk out with a ISM and a sism and a and a fear and a doubt and an anxiety if you're whole you're whole it says complete amen whole is complete and who are we we sing that song Oh I sing so many songs in the tractor so modified amen and I get in public and I embarrassed myself but there's a song I'll put it that way that says complete complete complete in Jesus or at least that's the way I remember it now my brother and sister when Jesus said you're made whole right amen who wants to be whole this morning who wants to have that complete and it comes down you see the prophet of God talking about having the Holy Ghost in our day six different ways he mentions this but one I like to hold on to he says that you have received the word for your day and acted on it yes it's quite a bit of difference between just receiving it a lot of people say God sent a prophet but my brother and sister they don't listen to The Prophet they don't care what the prophet said in fact they do many things contrary to what the prophet said amen so there it is you cannot say that you have got a fullness a completeness and whole if you refuse to act on the word of God so this man under the message of his hour went away from there with a revelation of who he was and what he was supposed to do and how he was supposed to live the gospel are you with me 10 healed one comes back they're healed in body nine healed in body yeah one I'm going to make it simple today healed in his soul which one would we choose Lord make me completely whole Hallelujah I stand before this crowd of witnesses Lord make me completely whole I don't want just healing my body and I have some afflictions in my flesh that I would love to be healed from but I want to be completely whole and if I had to choose between being completely whole spiritually and completely whole physically I will choose completely whole spiritually any day amen over that amen hallelujah sister Rebecca we prayed a lot of prayers for you amen I tell you they have strung through the years I don't mean to embarrass anyone but they've strung through the years and we see God come on the scene because my brother and sister we're living in the day of being completely whole God doesn't want a partially healed bride he don't want to partially serve me bride he wants a bride that's soul out amen that she's willing oh I tell you what happens my brother and sister let me just put it this way they're there all of them together praise God brother look the leprosy is falling off of me yes oh praise God hey what are you doing uh honestly I don't know what I'm doing I just feel like I I need to turn around yeah and go say thank you I don't understand what's happening in me I don't know but I got to go back and tell him thank you and he turns around and he goes back and it is that Revelation comes with footsteps we can't sit on our hands and say God's going to give me Revelation God's going to give me Revelation God wants you to March he wants you to walk he wants you to move he wants you to act on the word of God and as he's walking back to Jesus I believe this with all of my heart he started realizing wait he wasn't talking about the priest in the temple he was talking about my priest and my priest is right here and I'm going to go back and I'm going to give praise to him prise the Lord amen am I getting too carried away amen but the Revelation that turned him around oh aren't you glad God turned you around oh I live my heart to God every single day good days and bad days thank you Lord for turning me around amen amen hallelujah you know that's what repentance is going One Direction being completely turned around going back the other direction amen Lord forgive me but you can't continue on the same footsteps and say well the Lord forgave me now I can go do it again so one's made whole now Romans 12 1 through3 said I beseech ye therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice now no natural we're not of the spirit of mullik right we're not going to throw our children or whatever but I Tell You Through the Ages I've seen many a family sacrific their children they start by the parent God help you parents want you to know I love you but if you are not standing firm on the life this gospel because of something in your own life that's you know I can't tell my children not to listen to this if I'm listening to this see how the devil's so clever so clever binds the parent so that that Spirit can be passed to another generation and each generation says well I did it I can't really speak out against it there's a cleansing blood my brother and sister there's a fountain open in the House of David when you've been washed from that you can stand to your children and say don't go out here with this Behavior don't listen to this don't do that the kids might say Mom and Dad you did it no I did not and they're going to be what no I'm a new creature that's the old man that looked like your [Applause] daddy oh I'm telling you I've been there Saints I've looked my own children in the face and them raising an eyebrow you know how kids can do that like oh really dad and I used to come to a halt on that like oh how can I talk about that well I'll tell you how I finally got what was that guy in in mythology or whatever ever that you know didn't get his heel in the water and of all the places that Achilles of all the places that the arrow of the enemy would attack the arrows struck him right there in the heel come on parents grandparents brothers sisters preachers get it under the blood that's right and when it's under the blood you can tell your children don't you go parking don't you go petting don't you do this don't you do that they know good and well you did it but you as a new creature in Christ Jesus dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ can stand and say kids unless you want a negative thing to come in your life don't do it that's right amen I don't know why I threw that one in praise the Lord present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man a Measure of Faith I don't have as big a measure as other brothers pastors ministers Saints but coupling that together with my grace is sufficient I have the measure of faith I need paraphrasing it the prophet of God said everything you need to make the Rapture is all ready in you amen do we have any rapturing faith this morning amen it's in US Saints don't be searching around growling in the dirt somewhere running to and fro trying to find it it's already in you the key is take the key which is the word of God and unlock it and when it's unlocked available now what's the measure of Faith now what I'm fixing to go into I I kind of awkwardly shared this with the brothers made it sound like I was going to have something outside the message I don't know brother I don't know how I managed to bungle that so bad you know but here we go this is just an example okay I I don't take this as some fixed thing from the message are you okay if I share this are you guys Discerning enough to take you know my fumbles and throw them out I'll tell you what I'm going to take a word of God from the prophet he said you go to that church and if there's only one thing so if you only walk out of here with one thing today I I was successful amen now look at this I should have had the brothers graph this on the screen for you but the measure of faith my brother and sister we have a a lot of spiritual types and I'm I'm going to I'm going to just give you some measures here real quick first measure I believe in God I believe there is a God now you realize there's a lot of humanity doesn't believe that anymore they're coming down to where their their view is this can't be of God God's a supernatural holy God and this is what it is I I just can't believe in that so the first measure first little scoop is is they start to believe in God and you'll find a true atheist he don't have any understanding to him there can not be a God and I don't mean to be too humorous and and take away from the word of God today but my brother and sister there might possibly be some people on the Earth that some static electricity lit some moss on fire and now they exist right yes impossible otherwise it would be happening again and again and again so there's no measure there nothing's been poured in some of these are highly intelligent people now in case you guys wonder when I say highly intelligent I'm talking about most of you amen I understand dirt amen and I do believe I understand the bride of Christ but not much else not much else second measure would be someone having it poured into him saying oh God cares for me do you remember that time of your life when that second measure poured in God cares for me I mean something to him and then it comes a third measure would be that you would be able to say he's my savior so you see he's pouring more into us bringing us from nothing starting to bring us into a real position something of substance and he comes along and my brother and sister you can recognize he's your savior amen but you need this fourth measure that brings you to the place I trust him you can declare him your savior and not trust him that's true I've done marriage counseling on couples that were like well this is my husband this is my wife that's wonderful you've been brought together in matrimony but I don't trust him in fact brother Paul I don't even think I like him okay so we have a ways to go but my brother and sister look at this we come to this place I don't know about you okay we all come from different directions I come from a kid that was raised in a message church and chose to walk away let me give you a little analogy here I am 15 years old a real relationship with Jesus Christ is right there and I'm not going to do it physically but I went over here and I went up there and I went out that door I come back in that door I went up there I went over there I went there I went there I started to comeing back down here I went back up I went over there I went out that door I went over here I went to the four year I went out in the kitchen I went and I find finally made it back down and got here one day and realized this is who I am and I had to do all that to learn to trust him when if I had just surrendered and said Lord I know you're my savior and if you're my savior I can trust you I don't know if any of you ever had that experience amen I tell you what's sad is see I didn't do all of that alone sister Jerry married me and God just knew as much as sister Jerry being a Godly girl got saved and never wavered once in her life there must have been some character he must have wanted to mold in her there had to be something he wanted to mold in her or he molded it in her enough that she could actually speak it to me am Paul I don't care what you do I am going to serve God Amen hard words even as I say them right now emotion comes up within me I brought my own wife to a position she had to be that bold but it took all of that for me to trust him and I finally come to the place I Trust You Lord amen in the morning in the noon in the night and especially in the night I Trust You Lord prise God the fifth measure would be faith for healing God pours in enough Faith see you can't really pray for healing without having trust I'm talking to message Believers you realize God does hold you to a slightly different standard than denomination denomination blindly staggers into things and God honors it but God doesn't want iniquity in us that's right if we know he wants want us to do and he gives us faith for healing anyone been healed can we just give praise to the Lord lift your hands up high Saints amen let's give praise to the Lord hallelujah he pours in that measure of faith that in my little example that fifth Measure of Faith for healing and you're healed and that sixth measure he comes is when he pours in faith to believe every [Music] word every word you wonder why I threw the word iniquity out to you early so I just want to loosen you up to the simple fact that when we finally reach the level of every word two cups Saints you can follow it through the scriptures expressed in many ways two cups the cup of iniquity and the cup of righteousness right do you know we all possess those two cups and do you realize my brother and sister the essence is that it's really just one cup we're not walking around with two cups we have one cup and if we take this cup and we pour iniquity in the cup right cuz he says that when his Wrath would come when the cup of iniquity runthe so you pour iniquity into that cup you fill the cup everything about our life is going to be iniquity amen come on that's right look I want to make a point maybe to these young people might might I don't know why make a fool out of myself but that's all right I don't I hope none of you would say I recognize that brother Paul but you see a grew up on a farm school bus would come my mama would see me out the door and it was there my mama shirt's going to be buttoned up shirts going to be tucked in ETC by the time I got to my seat on the school bus my pants were pulled down that's nothing new you know that nothing new Under the Sun pants pulled down shirt untuck cuffs undone shirt buttoned halfway down went to school walked around the hallways of the school we were bad man yeah got off the school bus in front of my house looked like I just come from choir practice it ain't no way to live Saints young people it's no way to live that's right be who God calls you to be he didn't call you to be one of these little thugs on the street he called you to be a son or daughter of God pour the cup of iniquity out and fill it up with righteousness but brother Paul I'm trying I'm trying keep trying cuz you see it doesn't work like we think oh we're we're going to just empty the cup and fill it back up no what happens we have our cup of iniquity and God starts pouring righteousness into the iniquity and it causes great conflict within us we we struggle we agonize we labor we question am I really a Christian I don't think I'm a I don't know I'm a Christian God deals with I know I'm a Christian you get back out in school or wherever I don't know if I am and God still continuing to pour righteousness into that cup and there comes a day my brother and sister because oil and water do not mix amen righteousness and iniquity do not make and God keeps pouring into the cup until one day we can be my cop run is over oh he's filled me so full there's no room in my life for iniquity but Satan will search for the residue and this is a point I want to make about iniquity this morning Satan will search for the residue of iniquity in our lives and emphasize it blow it up make it look greater than it really is but God's over here pouring righteousness Hallelujah into the cup and sooner than later the righteousness washes every drop of iniquity amen prise from our cup the Lord but my flesh isn't perfect I could have brought you a quote this morning where brother bam said you are going to fight your flesh right to the coming of the Lord my goodness why don't you just acknowledge it not give into it and say okay I can just be friends with my flesh recognize your flesh is not your friend but God's pouring righteousness into us can someone lift their hand and say thank you Lord keep pouring Lord I'm here to receive it I want my up to run over oh Hallelujah see moving on the story sorry I feel a little disjointed here because I got about 300 other things I want to add on the tale of that and at home I I we have one service and usually I preach kind of on the long side and you know people some times are a little bit you know like couldn't you you know have just cut it off right here let the word flow all the rest of that was fluff well I've noticed that some of you when you're a coffee shop you go in there and they whipped cream a lot then you sat there and liit the whipped cream I thought it was meant to be mixed in but some of you sat there sometimes I get too much whipped cream but Saints I want you to see this I want this just to be a story something you take home amen amen amen I mean if you feel like we need an altar call at the end of a service it's not even oriented to that we can make the altar call if you want to come but sometimes I think the Saints just need to be reminded just need to be fed amen we're not feeding you lollipops we're feeding you the word amen so look at this analogy these 10 men all obeyed the word sister in our church said brother Paul I I work with this man and uh when I talk about these things he's there me too well God's doing me too God's moving me too God's healing me too she said brother Paul how do I answer well I'll tell you how you answer my brother and sister right here is your answer maybe not word for word all obeyed the word hallelujah I have a very large cross-section of friends everything Roman Catholics methodists Nazarene Baptist Mormon all kinds I got a Mormon Bishop calls me up real regular I love talking to you I'm ignoring my wife in the car as we travel on vacation Paul but I just wanted to talk to you cuz you just have such a unique perspective yes a word perspective all obeyed the word and all were able to say we did what we were told are you following me in the story every one of them he says Go and show yourself to the priest that's right all 10 can say we were going showing oursel to the priest able to say we did what Jesus said what we were told right from the red letter of the Bible we're doing what he told us to do right now no one please leave today thinking I'm speaking down on these people like I told you they're my friends these are men I rub shoulders with I interact when I hear that their baby is sick or granddaughter is sick I call them up and tell them I'm praying for you and when times are tough for us they call me up and say I'm praying for you amen I don't throw that out as something of no value I receive that and I tell them thank you and I tell them God bless you and it's amazing you'd think a Baptist would be all over God bless you but you tell them God bless you and they're like you're not Baptist I don't know if God can bless you you're not LDS I don't know if God can bless you well I don't care I think you're a fine man God bless you see they can say look we we took Jesus words right from the red letter of our Bible they were obedient and they were healed but they were not drawn into the mystery are you with me I don't mean to get wo don't you like that when preachers preach the mystery and we're all like I don't know what you're talking about come on you see they were all healed but not drawn into the mystery I don't mean to make light Saints I'm sorry I just when Paul feels good Paul it's funny or at least he thinks he's funny but they weren't drawn into the mystery you see when he said go show yourself to the priest those nine said I'm doing what I was told right come on they went right down showed their themselves at the priest there and and said look priest I met Jesus you are on probation from the church for 90 days for even mentioning that name inside our building no they didn't care Jesus told me go show myself to the priest amen they're already healed right now they're just being obedient right but one as I did sorry I hope I'm not distracting you but one God out there ways something something just started pulling him back and Revelation come and he says that's my priest I got to be you see you say brother Paul that's not really in the message but I believe I have Foundation because you see my brother and sister Jesus told them to show yourself to the priest he couldn't circumvent that command and it be the Fulfillment of the word so if he just went back to Jesus but that was not Revelation to him then he didn't fulfill the words of Jesus but he did fulfill the words of Jesus and he turned right back and he went and said this is my priest here and Jesus says Hey where's the rest of them my brother sister do you see where I'm going you see this that God had now in the mystery what is the mystery we'll get to it in a minute but you know it amen now in the mystery my brother and sister they went on doing exactly and they went and they showed themselves to the priest and because leper is also associated with separation they were now reunited re reestablished they can now be part of the church they can go back to their family they can go in fellowship and all of this and they're everywhere they went brother they're there and look at this amen I met Jesus on the outside of the city and and he told me go show myself to the priest praise God we have such a good priest and now I'm Healed they had a testimony one come back to the priest our high priest amen amen amen and Jesus then speaks these words that strike my heart so deep now you're completely whole from head to toe everything my brother and sister in the flesh I say thank you amen as I brought up earlier I don't mean to embarrass you sister Rebecca but God moves in mysterious ways and he's a powerful God and nothing's going to stand in his way amen cancer the prophet said will not stand in your way am mean God speaking to the prophet and the prophet amen poured all he had into the church and the church can stand on that promise amen amen and these men every day nine through the city yes I've been healed I've been healed right back to their old worship you ever wonder why brother brandom could have such phenomenal results in those meetings conversions deliverances discernments I've heard it explained well brother brandham sent them back to their church because there were no message churches to send them to I have a slightly different opinion they did what the word told them to do they went back and they stayed there but there was some I know them personally that went back and then sat in church and listened and we'll tell you our pastor was a fine godly man but what he preached would not Satisfy My Soul and they could tell you I did exactly what the prophet told me to do that's right but some went and set and said this is not good enough I've now tasted of the goodness of Jesus Christ and they got up I think brother Mike so P he'd have a testimony that might relate to that got up out of that and said I cannot sit here and starve to death I have to go find the word I've got to go find the revealed word amen and so here they are now all coming back together Jesus has went on he's went off to other cities other places and they're all back in their same community and they meet on the street imagine brother Ezra they all meet together I don't want to make you look negative but I can't tell the story and me be negative can I right hey brother Ezra how you doing fine you know I can tell it from the other side there's nine of us over here you just don't see us brother Ezra how you doing oh doing good we know we always wondered what happened to you that day I don't know if you just didn't have enough faith brother Ezra to believe him to go down and show yourself to the priest uh you know next thing we know you're not walking with us you're not in fellowship with us anymore and we went back and showed oursel to the priests and and it's so wonderful because now you know that this this leprosy this separation has gone from me I've been invited back into the church they showed me where my name has been reinstated on the book and you know I used to used to speak the young adults class and and they never did find a good teacher and so now that I'm clean again they just they let me take my position but what happened to you brother Ezra I did what he said what do you mean I went back to Jesus no no no no you don't understand he told us to go to to the priest I did yeah amen I don't want to drag this out and be labor it but I believe you follow me every little aspect well we're now part of the Rotary Club where Ezra you never came back we're now part of this deal over here and we we're on the baseball team and we're on the church this and we're on the church church that Ezra you never came back and what it can come down to my brother and sister is you'll sit there and you'll try to witness to people and they will tell you me too me too me too me too this is going to come out a little blunter than I meant it to be they have an experience but they were not drawn into the mystery they can testify everything saints that you can testify but they're not in the mystery are we good okay let me hurry up and finish somebody just pray brother Paul finishes amen you see see 1 Corinthians 2:7 from our original scripture but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto unto unto our glory amen this mystery hope hope yall don't mind I don't want to sound selfish but this mystery is for me all that was done all down through this mystery was for me can somebody say me [Laughter] too all of this was for me we're not being selfish we're we're not you know I I I got some other words but they're too harsh uh no no this is for us my brother and sister now don't you always love it any of you old enough to listen to Paul Harvey do any of you even know who Paul Harvey is okay I know we're not supposed to lift our hands and say Amen on things like Paul Harvey but Paul Harvey always had the rest of the story right and we never want to stop until the story stops we got to keep going so the rest of the story my brother and sister I I I already shared part of that but you see they come into this and there's this point yeah we listened to Jesus we did exactly what it said I got a red letter bible just like you did we believe every part of the red letter and all of this is but there's something different right something something that's just not the same I want to just ask you a simple question you remember when God called you out it wasn't the same anymore you picked your Bible up and you were like I always thought this was such a mystery but now the mystery is being opened yes amen now I know because you're well taught some of these crazy people in the message can believe they can read between the lines would you agree with me they must be just out of their mind that might be a little tricky amen they're out of their minds because they now have the mind of Christ they're no longer in their mind they have moved lest I sound mysterious they've moved into the mystery they're taking steps into the mystery and the Mystery is starting to unfold now my brother and sister you can't have the mystery unfold unless you're a part of the mystery you have to be a part amen for it to be real to you brother Ron hasn't sent the deacons yet so I think we're okay what is it but hidden deep in the heart of that Samaritan Saints was a knowledge of the mystery he didn't even know he was part of a mystery he didn't know nothing about nothing he didn't have any comprehension but here he is something pulling the third poll don't you just love the third pole I love the third poll amen how the prophet brings that out gives us very clear vision and the third bll being kind of tied I I say kind of I just don't want to emphasize that being tied my brother and sister between reading the lines if you are not part of the third pole you can't look at the word and read between the lines that's right and some people like well I don't know about that reading between the lines well if you're a holy ghost filled believer you've been reading between the lines and maybe never even knew it amen amen but we have a misconception of what reading between the lines is we think we have got a holds of our Bible our message book and we have pride the word open and we're looking in over here at the mystery no wonder the unbeliever thinks you're all crazy because they missed the fact it was just the opposite God opened the word I don't know if I could do this correct God opened the word reached and pulled you it's not you opening the word and looking in it was God opened the word and got a hold to you and pulled you into the word but the carnal mind says oh what do you mean that you can open the word and look beyond that nonsense well they're not in the mystery they're not part of this revelation of the mystery but when God comes and opens his word and reaches out and grabs you and pulls you into the word you can't help yourself I see it I see it what do you see Christ it's not denomination pulling you it's not message pulling you it's not a pastor pulling you it's God Amen our Lord Jesus Christ himself opened the word reached out got to Hal to you and pulls you into his presence and the word takes on a whole new life and someone says explain that to me uh well one day I was reading my Bible right I read my Bible me too I don't see what you're talking about right well I I was reading in my seals book I read my seals book God spoke to me God speaks to me too but what they're missing is the mystery of God opening his word and reaching out getting a hold of you and pulling you into the mystery the carnal mind turns that around and thinks we must do something I'll tell you I've done nothing that's right I've been given a good gift of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I've been given the good gift of the love of Jesus Christ I've been given the good gift of his holy spirit nothing I ever could have attained to am amen but he said come see it from my point of view here it is you know there's a lot of etiquette I think it's funny you look on the internet and they'll tell you now if you're crossing a Rancher or Farmer's land and you come to a fence this is how you cross the fence well let me tell you how Farmers cross the fence we either take a stick and push the top wire or so low we crawl over or we put a foot on the third wire and pry it up till we can duck and go through it I like all of their etiquette that they have but if you're talking about a real farmer amen cuz I'll you know if if I tweak the fence I'll fix it I don't know if that was real to a lot of you people in the city here I don't know why I even said that cuz some of you just look at me blankly like Crossing fences uh our fences are all this tall and vinyl but let me tell you my brother and sister God would walk up to the fence of the word right Beyond the Veil he's not going to just say squeeze your way through no come on come over and see it from my point of view quit looking at it as a educated Christian and start looking at it as a holy ghost filed Christian and your view is going to be so different good in fact you're going to love the view so much you can't go back huh hallelujah amen is my craziness making any sense hallelujah amen what what's the mystery somebody know what the mystery is Christ in you am God Vindicated his message that don't mean it's in US you can listen to a tape and read a book every single day of your life doesn't mean this word is in you you can read the Bible I I met a man was telling me praise God how many times you read the Bible I said well I believe I read all of the Bible but I I read a little in Genesis and then I went to Revelation I come back to Leviticus and then I jumped over to acts that's no way to read the Bible I've read the Bible seven times cover to cover and if you ever okay I'll stick with my method CU my method which I believe was God's method not Paul to claim it God's method yes come over here and look at it from my point of view Beyond the Veil hallelujah amen once it was death to go now it's death not to Hallelujah I say it's time to step into the mystery amen my brother and sister I I really believe it amen I'll read the scripture we've already covered it Colossians 1:25 through 27 where I'm I've made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generation but is now now now means next week right now M 1965 come on Saints God's talking personal to us this morning somebody needs to reach up and take a hold of this mystery that has now been made manifest to his Saints Lord here's my hands Lord fill them Here's My Heart Lord fill it here's my mind Lord fill it and amen if there's iniquity in my cup pour more righteousness in my cup let it overflow Lord let it Wash Me by the water of the word until I am a vessel of righteousness hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles there's a mystery here Saints I know it's understated we're the bride of Christ and I don't want to be rude brother Steven was just sharing a little testimony with him in the back and sometimes you feel like your preaching can be a little sharp or a little pointed but remember we brought out a little bit we need to look at ourself we need to look at ourselves circumspectly we need to look with strong Vision yes is this mystery really revealed to me or do I just believe the message Brothers turn the heat up we dumped a little too much cold water on the church come on Saints I think as a minister it's a fair question do we just believe the message or do we see ourself in the mystery amen from 15 to my early 30s I've been called on this before and people say it can't be so but I do believe it can be so from 15 to my M early mid-30s I was a backsliding message hippie some of you'd be saying no sorry buddy you can't but no no if you would ask me about the time in my testimony the brother Ron got a hold to me one day outside of church and said you need to quit fooling around and get serious about serving God I had hair that if it hadn't been stuck down with that whatever gel would have easily rubbed my collars and hung down to my nose yeah and if you'd have cornered me on the on the job I was living in Colorado hanging drywall and somebody had say something about God and I'd tell them buddy you got it wrong that's pretty hypocritical right when you don't live it but you got an opinion this is what God said wow and for a moment let me get my hair out of my eyes so I could show you right here in my Bible that I have in my work bag my tool bag I think you can be a backslid message believer oh yeah amen but mention a mystery of Christ in me no all I need is a haircut and I'm fine come on Saints I don't mean to be too hard but too many of us Brothers have got a haircut but that's about all yeah come on come on let's get in the mystery brother and sister let's step into it God's holding it open for us to see who we really are amen man allow him to draw you in and see it from his perspective was that too strong okay I I don't like to be rude I don't like to be rude but we do have to make a point you see my brother and sister we don't want to live on the friends we want to be part of the mystery of Christ I read this to myself this way Christ in me that's right amen the word says Christ in you and I'll say Christ in you but for me Christ in me amen amen the hope of glory that's my day-to-day life that's my day-to-day Vision that I have Christ in me and and can are are we honest people amen imagine that asking a church full of Believers are you honest our cup e and flows do you follow me the Devil comes along and I didn't have time to pray today I didn't have time to read my Bible I was so busy someone tell me what that is Iniquity CU I know I need to do that so here I'm closing promise you nobody nobody get up and leave yet the Devil comes along pours a little iniquity in my cup my cup's still overflowing but now it's not all righteousness at some point I've got to fill that cup with enough righteousness to force the iniquity out of the cup see this is e flow of Life Saints right now I'm preaching this to you you non-judgmental are you able to accept it non-judgmental amen the devil's here he's trying to pour it in you know Sister Jerry and I was sitting in a restaurant a while back sometime back here and we never even thought we went in and sat down

brother said as he was sharing with us before the special amen just we're just talking and here comes the waitress and we're like no everybody drinks it the devil will be telling you everybody does it everybody thinks like this everybody acts like this if you want the devil to not pour something in your cup you're going to have to guard the cup you're going to have to turn that cup as it were figurative here over the lady's like Well ma'am sir if you don't want wine you're supposed to turn the cup over point taken amen and she looked at us and saw her response and she says I'll tell you what I will just do she was friendly I'll tell you what I'll just do I'll remove the cup thank you goodbye cup of iniquity I don't need you anymore in my life cup of iniquity I'm moving on to a place that I'm drinking from another cup I'm living in another world I'm filled with another spirit I don't need your cop Satan Hallelujah is it okay to be excited amen I'll tell you what I want my cup to
