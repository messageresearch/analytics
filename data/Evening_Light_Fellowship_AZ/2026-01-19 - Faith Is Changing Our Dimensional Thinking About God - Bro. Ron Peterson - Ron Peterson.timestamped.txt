[36:05] in thee.
[36:10] But he knows I couldn't live on
[36:15] the mountain.
[36:19] So he picked out
[36:22] a valley
[36:25] for me.
[36:30] He leads me
[36:32] beside
[36:35] still waters.
[36:40] somewhere
[36:42] in the valley
[36:45] below.

[36:52] me aside
[36:54] to be tested.

[37:41] ahead
[37:42] for me.

[37:52] still waters.

[38:19] he restoreth
[38:21] my soul.

[38:31] still waters
[38:37] somewhere
[38:38] in the valley
[38:41] below.
[38:46] And he draws
[38:48] me aside
[38:50] to be tested
[38:53] and tried.
[38:55] But in the valley
[38:58] he restoreth
[39:00] my soul
[39:05] and he draws
[39:07] me aside
[39:10] to be tested.
[39:12] Oh and tried but in the valley
[39:17] he restoreth
[39:20] my soul.
[39:29] Amen. Thank you, brother Chris. Amen.
[39:31] Let's stand this morning as we get ready
[39:33] to change this
[39:36] service in a song or two. I won't go
[39:39] back.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; I won't go back.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song this morning.
[39:45] Amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; The everpresent help is here to change
[39:51] your situation.
[39:53] Hallelujah.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; What he can do, he specializes this
[39:58] morning. Oh, he can take the wrong and
[40:01] he can make it right this morning.
[40:04] Amen. Let's worship him this morning in
[40:06] an atmosphere that he dwells in.
[40:10] Oh, you love the Lord today.
[40:13] Let him come by. Let him speak to your
[40:15] heart this morning. Let's sing this
[40:18] morning.

[41:12] the peace that passes all understanding.
[41:16] Oh, crazy

[41:24] And right now for a moment
[41:28] today is the day I've been changed.
[41:35] I've been changed.
[41:39] And I have waited for this moment to
[41:44] come. And I won't let it pass
[41:49] me by.

[42:00] way it used to be until your presence
[42:06] chang.

[42:40] no more shame.
[42:44] Oh, no more fear. Fear. My past is over.
[42:52] It's over.

[42:59] is the moment.
[43:02] Today is the day I can change.
[43:08] I can change.
[43:13] I will wait for this moment to come and
[43:18] I won't let it pass.
[43:27] I won't go back. I can't go back to the
[43:32] way it used to be. Until your presence
[43:37] come and change me.
[43:41] I can't I won't go back. I can't go back
[43:47] to the way it used to be before your
[43:53] came. I won't go back.
[43:57] Oh, I won't go back. Can't go back to
[44:03] the way I used to be.
[44:06] For your presence
[44:23] came
[44:26] and it changed me.
[44:30] Give him praise this morning.
[44:40] Amen. Amen. God bless you all this
[44:43] morning. I greet you in the lovely name
[44:44] of Jesus Christ. Good to have so many
[44:47] out to the house of the Lord. And we
[44:49] welcome all of our visitors. Brother
[44:51] Menow and Sister Irene. God bless you.
[44:54] Our special friends. Uh somebody said
[44:57] Gabriel Martinez
[45:00] is here. He's in the Hey, Gabe.
[45:08] Amen. Brother Dave Maple, God bless you.
[45:11] It's good to have you here.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Sister Nancy Patterson, Sister Py,
[45:20] &gt;&gt; so many old friends.
[45:24] Oh, you make new ones, but ain't nothing
[45:27] like old.
[45:30] I believe saints of God that something
[45:33] is happening
[45:37] &gt;&gt; and I want you all to be
[45:41] extremely
[45:44] conscientious
[45:46] of what I'm going to preach this
[45:48] morning.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; I believe it's a game changer.
[45:56] I believe
[45:58] that it will do something for you.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; I don't normally say those things, but
[46:06] just letting you know
[46:09] that I've been very, very deeply moved
[46:12] in the last couple weeks. Deeply
[46:15] more so than I have, I want to say in
[46:18] years.
[46:20] my personal time with God,
[46:23] &gt;&gt; my devotions with my wife of sitting
[46:27] down and going over some things,
[46:32] trials in my life,
[46:34] and yet I know that God's got it all in
[46:37] control.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you all this morning.
[46:43] Let's just remain standing as we turn in
[46:46] our Bibles. I'd like you to turn with
[46:49] me. Thank you musicians. Brother Chris,
[46:51] thank you for that song special each and
[46:54] every one. And listen, while you're
[46:56] turning to Ephesians chapter 3, I'm
[46:59] going to make an announcement here right
[47:01] now um that I am embarking on a u a new
[47:08] study series, the seven church ages.
[47:12] And we are going to start this coming
[47:14] Friday. Somebody say Friday.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Friday.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Friday. here at the church 7:30.
[47:22] Um this is Friday the 23rd. Bring your
[47:26] seven church age book. If you don't have
[47:29] one, well then we've got some copies of
[47:32] others here. Uh and if you don't have
[47:34] them, and we need to order some, we're
[47:36] going to do it, but we're going to start
[47:39] uh on this Friday, but I'm probably
[47:42] going to do it on Sunday evenings.
[47:46] Sunday evenings every other Sunday for a
[47:50] while. Now, this is just optional, but I
[47:53] want to say to as many of my young
[47:56] people, I would love to see you there to
[47:58] to kind of get an idea
[48:02] a little bit of the history of what God
[48:05] has done, but not only to see what God
[48:09] has done, because when you see what God
[48:11] has done, you will know what he's going
[48:13] to do.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because as it was,
[48:18] &gt;&gt; so shall it be. So we understand those
[48:21] things. So I'm excited. I tell you what,
[48:23] my wife and I, I think, are on page like
[48:26] 143 right now in the seven church age
[48:28] book and every paragraph.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my, you just as well highlight and
[48:34] underline the whole thing.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; It's just like your Bible. You read it
[48:39] before, but man, why didn't I see that
[48:41] before?
[48:42] It's cuz we're coming into a season.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; All of you understand something. And
[48:48] listen very carefully.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; We're coming into the season
[48:53] where this is going to affect you and
[48:56] it's going to change you. You're being
[48:58] changed right now.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Every one of you that have received this
[49:04] message,
[49:05] &gt;&gt; God did it for a purpose.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The end result
[49:11] &gt;&gt; is rapture.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; So he sent you a voice.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; He sent you a messenger
[49:21] &gt;&gt; to make you aware of the time and the
[49:24] season. This is an end time seed sign.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:35] So
[49:37] I just let you know the wife and I and
[49:40] my daughter happened to be there. She
[49:42] had spent the night and uh and uh we had
[49:46] our devotions
[49:48] uh that morning. We were reading our
[49:49] Bible and each one would take a read a
[49:51] few verses and then we got done doing
[49:54] that and then we uh went to the seven
[49:57] church age book and everything and wow
[50:00] there's something just opened up to me
[50:03] that I tell you this what I'm speaking
[50:06] on today is going to launch out
[50:11] in multitudes of directions.
[50:14] So, I'm not going to overwhelm you with
[50:17] all that God has been dealing with me
[50:20] right now in one service because you
[50:22] can't do it.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; You just can't do it.
[50:28] And so, we know that God is doing
[50:33] something right now.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says something is
[50:38] fixing to happen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; And I believe we need to be acutely
[50:42] aware. Yes. Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Of what's going on. Ephesians chapter 3.
[50:48] Ephesians chapter 3.
[50:51] Amen.
[50:55] Brother Johnny Green. It's good to have
[50:57] you and your daughter here. God bless
[50:59] you richly. Amen.
[51:03] Ephesians chapter 3.
[51:08] for this cause
[51:13] I Paul
[51:15] the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
[51:17] Gentiles.
[51:19] So now he's telling us here's a cause
[51:23] and effect.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Dave Mabel it's because in that
[51:29] day
[51:32] &gt;&gt; the Lord's day you'll begin to
[51:35] &gt;&gt; see something that you never saw before.
[51:38] Amen.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; So now the Apostle Paul who the
[51:43] disciples said he's hard to be
[51:46] understood
[51:53] &gt;&gt; if you have heard of the dispensation
[51:56] of the grace of God which is given me to
[52:00] youward.
[52:04] how that by revelation he made known
[52:06] unto me the mystery
[52:09] as I wrote of four and few words whereby
[52:13] when you read
[52:16] you may understand my knowledge in the
[52:18] mystery of Christ
[52:21] which in other ages was not made known
[52:23] unto the sons of men as it is now
[52:26] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[52:29] prophets by the spirit
[52:33] prophets speak it, apostles teach it,
[52:37] God reveals it.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; God alone is the revealer of his
[52:47] &gt;&gt; word.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "The Holy Ghost is
[52:50] the divine revealer of God's word."
[52:54] Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; That the Gentiles should be fellow hes
[53:00] and of the same body and partakers of
[53:02] his promise in Christ by the gospel.
[53:06] Whereof I was made a minister according
[53:09] to the gift of the grace of God given
[53:12] unto me by the effectual working of his
[53:15] power.
[53:17] Unto me who am least less than the least
[53:20] of all saints. Is this grace given
[53:25] that I might preach among the Gentiles
[53:27] the unsearchable riches of Christ?
[53:33] than to make all men see what is the
[53:36] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[53:39] beginning of the world hath been hid in
[53:42] God
[53:43] who created all things by Jesus Christ
[53:47] to the intent that now
[53:51] unto the principalities and powers in
[53:53] heavenly places might be known by the
[53:57] church the manifold wisdom
[54:00] &gt;&gt; of God.
[54:01] Wow.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; What an inheritance.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; That you might know.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; S Marge, God bless you. I looked I I
[54:14] They said you were here. I looked for
[54:16] somebody waving a little white flag.
[54:17] There he was.
[54:21] That you might know the manifold.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Not unfold. Manifold.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Multiple.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:32] God's changing.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; He's unfolding.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; The dimensions of heaven
[54:41] &gt;&gt; are inner penetrating.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Into this realm,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; and you you have to understand why all
[54:50] of this is happening.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; It's happening for a purpose.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:00] according to the eternal purpose which
[55:02] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in
[55:05] whom we have boldness and access with
[55:09] confidence
[55:11] &gt;&gt; by the faith of him.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Wherefore I desire that you faint not at
[55:23] my tribulations for you which is for
[55:25] your glory. Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; For this cause I bow my knees unto the
[55:31] father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom
[55:34] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[55:37] named.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; That he would grant you according to the
[55:42] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[55:45] with might by his spirit on the inner
[55:48] man
[55:50] &gt;&gt; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[55:53] faith.
[55:56] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[55:59] love may be able to comprehend
[56:03] with all saints what is the breadth and
[56:06] the length and the depth
[56:09] and the height.
[56:13] This was very much quickened to me this
[56:16] verse
[56:18] that God is changing his dimension and
[56:21] trying to take your understanding
[56:25] and make it multi-dimensional.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just on one plane,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; not carnal,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; but spiritual
[56:42] &gt;&gt; and to know the love of Christ which
[56:45] passes knowledge, that you might be
[56:48] filled with all the fullness of God.
[56:53] Now unto him that is able to do
[56:56] exceedingly ab abundantly above all that
[56:59] we ask or think
[57:02] according to the power that workketh in
[57:05] us.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; It's a power. It's working in you.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; And God is determined
[57:15] &gt;&gt; to save you.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; This isn't you saving yourself. This
[57:22] isn't you keeping the commandments. This
[57:24] isn't
[57:26] &gt;&gt; about you.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; It's about him.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; It's about a covenant that he made with
[57:35] our father Abraham.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Help me this morning,
[57:41] Lord.
[57:42] Unto him be glory in the church by
[57:46] Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world
[57:50] without end.
[57:52] Amen.
[57:55] Verse 18 again may be able to comprehend
[57:57] with all the saints what is the breadth
[57:59] and the length and the depth and the
[58:01] height.
[58:04] Turn with me one last scripture. Romans
[58:07] 8. Then I'll have you to be seated.
[58:10] Romans chapter 8 verses 35
[58:15] through 39.
[58:23] Who shall separate us from the love of
[58:25] Christ?
[58:28] Shall tribulation
[58:31] or distress
[58:33] or persecution
[58:35] or famine or nakedness
[58:39] or peril
[58:41] or sword
[58:43] all kinds of issues.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; But he's asking the question, who shall
[58:48] separate you? In what situation
[58:51] &gt;&gt; is God not in control of?
[58:56] As it is written, for thy sake we are
[58:58] killed all the day long. We are counted
[59:01] as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all
[59:04] things we are more than conquerors
[59:07] through him that loved us.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; For I am persuaded.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; I too
[59:16] &gt;&gt; will say yay and amen to that scripture.
[59:18] I'm persuaded also.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; How about you? Amen.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; I am
[59:25] &gt;&gt; persuaded
[59:27] &gt;&gt; that neither death,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; nor
[59:32] angels,
[59:34] nor principalities, nor powers, nor
[59:38] things present, nor things to come,
[59:42] nor height, nor depth,
[59:45] nor any other creature shall be able to
[59:47] separate us from the love of God
[59:51] which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless the reading of his
[59:57] word this morning. You may be seated.
[1:00:08] I want to title my sermon this morning,
[1:00:13] Faith Changes
[1:00:16] Your Dimensional Understanding
[1:00:19] About God. Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Faith
[1:00:26] changes
[1:00:28] your dimensional
[1:00:31] thinking or your understanding about
[1:00:33] God.
[1:00:36] And I want to take a subject of we are
[1:00:39] changing dimensions.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; It is happening.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; It's going on right now. You may not see
[1:00:49] it.
[1:00:50] You not may not be fully aware of it,
[1:00:55] but you're being changed from mortal to
[1:00:58] immortality.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; How is God doing it? By the revealing of
[1:01:04] his word to you personally. Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say that I have been
[1:01:16] personally
[1:01:18] profoundly affected in the last
[1:01:22] couple of weeks.
[1:01:25] And I wish to share with you a little
[1:01:29] bit of what God has been dealing with me
[1:01:32] on. I believe that brother Brennham
[1:01:34] tells us that you pastors get into that
[1:01:37] word, you partake of it and then break
[1:01:40] it down and give it to your people.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[1:01:45] um I have been studying and once I broke
[1:01:51] into this realm, I wanted to see what
[1:01:54] does brother Brennham say about it.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; What does brother Brennham say about
[1:01:59] another dimension? All right.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; He actually, if you put in quotation
[1:02:06] marks, type in another dimension,
[1:02:10] he he speaks about it 84 times,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; saying,
[1:02:18] "I live most of the time in another
[1:02:20] dimension."
[1:02:25] Brother Billy Paul told me as we
[1:02:28] traveled together, he said,
[1:02:31] "Daddy, on the last couple months of his
[1:02:34] life," he said, "Billy,"
[1:02:37] he said, "the revelations are coming so
[1:02:41] strong
[1:02:42] and so vivid
[1:02:46] that I can't tell the reality."
[1:02:49] is this vision
[1:02:52] or the reality.
[1:02:58] That's how real
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; it is.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; I want all of you to understand that
[1:03:04] vision or revelation
[1:03:08] is actually sight.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; You begin to see something.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; You begin to understand something. You
[1:03:17] begin to catch something that you didn't
[1:03:19] before.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And because of you're catching that,
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; it's changing.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:03:34] so the prophet mentions another
[1:03:36] dimension 84 times. I'm not going to
[1:03:40] read you every quote. I think all of you
[1:03:42] should go and type that in and look at
[1:03:44] it. It will astound you. But I just
[1:03:48] pulling up just a few of these
[1:03:50] to let you show what he said about this
[1:03:55] other dimension in believing thou this
[1:03:57] in 1951.
[1:04:01] My ministry is praying for the sick.
[1:04:04] And in order to do that, I must come
[1:04:06] into another world
[1:04:09] that people know nothing about.
[1:04:13] There's just no need of trying to
[1:04:15] explain it. You can't do it. I go to
[1:04:18] fasting about three days before my
[1:04:21] service
[1:04:22] and it lifts me up into a sphere there.
[1:04:27] Well, that's just it. It goes into
[1:04:30] another dimension that sees things and
[1:04:34] so forth.
[1:04:36] Then he says, "Between services, I go
[1:04:39] and relax my spirit, go hunting or
[1:04:41] fishing.
[1:04:45] In the testimony of Jesus Christ in
[1:04:49] 1953,
[1:04:51] he says there is another dimension that
[1:04:53] many people know little of
[1:04:57] but God lives in that place.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Are you interested
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; in that dimension? Because that's where
[1:05:04] God lives.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "But very few people know
[1:05:09] anything about it.
[1:05:12] Now in order to understand this
[1:05:15] dimension I want all of you to
[1:05:16] understand it just doesn't happen by
[1:05:19] chance
[1:05:23] even as coming to church
[1:05:26] if you're not seeking God if you're not
[1:05:28] praying if you're not quieting your
[1:05:31] spirit in coming here and saying God
[1:05:33] give me something you will sit right
[1:05:36] there in your chair and not be fed and
[1:05:39] not get anything. my brother.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; While others around you may be feasting
[1:05:44] and enjoying the revealed word, but
[1:05:47] you're sitting there going, "Why am I
[1:05:49] not?" So look at yourself first. Judge
[1:05:52] yourself.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Am I prepared? Am I ready?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; I say get ready.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; I SAY PRAY.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; PRAY MUCH. PRAY BEFORE YOU GET HERE.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Don't do the last minute. Okay, Lord,
[1:06:09] hurry up and bless me.
[1:06:12] So,
[1:06:14] the testimony of Jesus Christ, that's in
[1:06:18] another dimension many people know
[1:06:19] little of, but God lives in that place.
[1:06:22] And the only thing you have to do is to
[1:06:24] not think about your senses,
[1:06:28] how you feel.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Quit going off of feelings.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Watch what he says. Just believe what he
[1:06:38] said for the scripture cannot be broken.
[1:06:42] Whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:06:44] pray, believe you receive it. Present
[1:06:47] tense, it will be given to you. Future
[1:06:50] tense. St. Mark 11:24. Have faith in
[1:06:54] God.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; And God will bring it to pass.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; He cannot heal. We can only declare.
[1:07:03] We cannot heal. We can only declare that
[1:07:06] Jesus Christ is risen from the dead. He
[1:07:09] healed you when he died.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; He rose again for your justification.
[1:07:14] And when you believe on him, you're
[1:07:16] justified in the sight of God. Then we
[1:07:18] believe he is risen from the dead. His
[1:07:21] atonement was for every one of you.
[1:07:24] Every person, every sick person was
[1:07:26] healed when Jesus put it at the deposit
[1:07:30] at Calvary.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:36] your faith
[1:07:38] that you have and every one of you I
[1:07:41] want all of you to know there is none of
[1:07:44] you that are a seed gene of GOD BUT WHAT
[1:07:48] GOD has given every one of you a measure
[1:07:51] of faith
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; but it's up to you what you do with it
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; right
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; do you nurture it.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Do you seek it?
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Do you get into it? You do. You feed
[1:08:10] your faith.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Don't just sit back and haphazardly say,
[1:08:17] "Well, if I'm predestinated, I'll get it
[1:08:19] and therefore just sit back and do
[1:08:22] nothing." No, you got to seek.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; And you shall find.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; You got to ask. See, there is a
[1:08:30] responsibility placed upon you. AND I AS
[1:08:33] YOUR PASTOR, I'M PUTTING A
[1:08:35] responsibility on each one of you. Seek
[1:08:38] and YOU SHALL FIND. ASK, IT SHALL BE
[1:08:40] GIVEN.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; KNOCK, THE DOOR SHALL BE OPEN.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; That's his word. But you got a
[1:08:47] responsibility. If you don't do it, you
[1:08:49] ain't going to receive.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You'll then be foolish.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Preach it.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] Now
[1:09:01] your faith that you have, it is a gift
[1:09:06] of God.
[1:09:08] For by grace are you saved through
[1:09:11] faith.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Faith is the vehicle that takes you to
[1:09:16] salvation.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And it
[1:09:21] is not of works.
[1:09:24] None of you can earn it. It was given to
[1:09:26] you by gracemen,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; lest any man should boast.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; I can promise you and assure you that
[1:09:35] when we get to heaven, none of you are
[1:09:37] going to walk through those pearly gates
[1:09:39] and you're going to say, "Aha, I have
[1:09:41] arrived. I did it. I accomplished it. I
[1:09:45] kept the faith. I I earned my way.
[1:09:51] Now, where's my mansion
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; walking in there? I tell you, we will
[1:09:57] all bow our heads.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; We will all humb be so humbled.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; It was by your grace I've made it.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:10:14] it's listen to me now. It's not the
[1:10:17] messenger
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; preaching his message
[1:10:21] that quickens your gift.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say because you're seed,
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; you have an ability to pull.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; The reason that the prophet had a
[1:10:40] message to preach was because you were
[1:10:43] demanding it.
[1:10:46] You were pulling it.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Now just hold this thought. Now
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; it was faith being energized by the
[1:10:56] elect seed within
[1:10:59] each one of you.
[1:11:05] It's faith or Holy Ghost revelation that
[1:11:08] calls the bride to come out of foolish
[1:11:10] things.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Faith which is given as a gift from God
[1:11:17] to you. It was given to you when you
[1:11:21] kept all the word and was perfect in all
[1:11:23] your ways.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; He gave it to you before the foundation
[1:11:27] of the world. In fact, gifts and
[1:11:28] callings
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; are without repentance.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] It's God's faith operating God's gift
[1:11:42] giving you the ability then to hear what
[1:11:45] the spirit is saying.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:11:51] brother Brennham in 1955 begins to show
[1:11:54] you how faith operates.
[1:11:57] He says, "Now your faith pulls from the
[1:12:00] gift of God just like it was the great
[1:12:02] gift of God."
[1:12:04] And this gift here is just a small
[1:12:06] amateur gift, but it's of God just the
[1:12:10] same. He's talking about this gift that
[1:12:12] he had been given. So your faith
[1:12:16] operates it.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Not mine. Yours is the one who does it.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Jesus's faith that healed the
[1:12:27] woman. He said, "Thy faith."
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Thy faith has saved thee.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Thy faith did it. Her faith operated the
[1:12:39] gift of God that was in him.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Now, as I've been declaring unto you for
[1:12:46] the past couple of weeks,
[1:12:49] as I had been listening to the uniting
[1:12:52] time and sign.
[1:12:55] The prophet said that uh a prophet when
[1:12:59] he sent to a generation is a sign.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; It's a declaration.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; God does it for a purpose.
[1:13:11] In fact, brother Brennham uses the
[1:13:13] terminology, it's the end time seed
[1:13:17] sign.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Now, a sign precedes an event.
[1:13:22] Signs are never put after the fact. Dip
[1:13:25] in the road. They don't do it after you
[1:13:27] hit the dip.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; It's always preceding.
[1:13:35] So, a sign
[1:13:38] precedes something.
[1:13:40] I looked up Webster and Webster said a
[1:13:43] sign is a a gesture communicating
[1:13:47] a command, a wish or a thought.
[1:13:52] We can think of sign language
[1:13:55] and many of us know simple signs.
[1:14:02] Okay?
[1:14:04] Right?
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; We see certain signs and they declare
[1:14:09] something.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And so it is also Webster says is a
[1:14:16] symbol declaring that something is about
[1:14:19] to happen.
[1:14:23] It is also
[1:14:26] a public announcement or a public
[1:14:30] display for an advertisement.
[1:14:34] We see along the road everywhere
[1:14:36] advertisement this sign uh you got to
[1:14:38] buy this get this truck come to this
[1:14:41] restaurant signs everywhere sign
[1:14:46] you to stop they get your attention oh
[1:14:49] hamburger I need a hamburger
[1:14:52] oh I need a new car
[1:14:54] it's telling you so there's a purpose
[1:14:56] they want to get your purpose to stop
[1:14:59] and buy and consume whatever
[1:15:03] A sign is also for giving direction or
[1:15:06] warning.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, a prophet is given
[1:15:12] and it's strategically placed before the
[1:15:16] event.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; So, a prophet is a specifically gifted
[1:15:23] man who has the ability to see into
[1:15:26] another dimension. Amen.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Remember, brother Brennham said, "Most
[1:15:31] of the time, I'm living in another
[1:15:35] dimension."
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; The men that traveled with brother
[1:15:38] Brennham were very much aware of that.
[1:15:40] He said, "Brethren,"
[1:15:42] he says, "I live in another dimension."
[1:15:45] He said, "It just makes me nervous."
[1:15:49] He said, he told Brother Perry Green,
[1:15:51] and driving down the road, he asked him,
[1:15:54] he said, "Um, can you tell me a joke?"
[1:15:57] And brother Perry thought, "Well, maybe
[1:16:00] he'll rebuke me because I've been known
[1:16:02] to tell too many jokes." Told him a
[1:16:05] joke. He laughed, said, "Tell me another
[1:16:07] one." And so on until he told several
[1:16:09] jokes. And he said, "You're probably
[1:16:11] wondering why I'm asking you to tell me
[1:16:15] a a joke." He said, "Because laughter is
[1:16:18] as a good medicine." Yes.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Laughter is what causes me to
[1:16:24] relax my spirit and I come down out of
[1:16:27] that realm."
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; He says, "Because
[1:16:32] as an example," he said, "See this house
[1:16:34] we're passing right here? There's a man
[1:16:36] inside that home. He's dying of cancer.
[1:16:40] See the car that is passing us?" He
[1:16:43] said, "They're going to have an accident
[1:16:44] just down the road."
[1:16:46] He began now to be totally aware and
[1:16:50] sensitive of things that are happening
[1:16:53] around him.
[1:16:56] And
[1:16:58] I want to say that
[1:17:02] when the gift operates
[1:17:06] or is activated with the prophet, time
[1:17:08] means nothing.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Forward, backward.
[1:17:15] He can go into the past as well as into
[1:17:18] the future.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; During the prayer line, while he is
[1:17:22] discerning the hearts, he actually
[1:17:25] understand this now. He becomes a
[1:17:27] window, a channel by which people can
[1:17:30] see
[1:17:32] into another dimension.
[1:17:35] He says, "Come close." He said, "Now,
[1:17:37] that that won't hurt you. That's just
[1:17:40] him."
[1:17:41] Now they're coming for whatever purpose,
[1:17:44] for whatever issue they're having in
[1:17:47] their life. He says, now are we
[1:17:51] strangers one to another? Yes, we are.
[1:17:54] I've never met you. Is that true? How
[1:17:56] much of the time does he just visit with
[1:17:58] them? He said, now if God would show me
[1:18:03] what your problem is, would you believe?
[1:18:06] You would.
[1:18:09] Okay. If you'll take God at his word,
[1:18:11] he'll take you at your word.
[1:18:14] Do you believe me? To be God's prophet.
[1:18:17] Now, what is he what's he doing? He's
[1:18:19] he's catching their spirit.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Because now he's going to become a
[1:18:24] window. He's going to be a channel.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be God's prophet?
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; You do? I I see.
[1:18:35] Oh, he goes back into time.
[1:18:38] He begins to declare something and he
[1:18:42] says, "Most of the time I have no idea
[1:18:45] what I'm saying. I'm just a voice."
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Now, what is he doing? He's a window.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; For those believers to see that first
[1:18:57] off, GOD UNDERSTANDS WHERE YOU'RE AT and
[1:18:59] what you're going through BECAUSE HE'S A
[1:19:01] HIGH PRIEST THAT CAN BE TOUCHED BY THE
[1:19:03] FEELING OF YOUR INFIRMITIES. BUT TOO
[1:19:05] MUCH OF THE TIME we tend to be so
[1:19:08] narcissistic in OUR VIEWPOINT TOWARDS
[1:19:10] GOD IS EVEN GOD DOESN'T UNDERSTAND what
[1:19:13] I'm going through.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be God's prophet?
[1:19:19] Oh, you do.
[1:19:22] If God would show me, would you believe?
[1:19:27] Oh, you would.
[1:19:29] So now
[1:19:31] he's this window. He's this channel that
[1:19:34] God is using.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And many of them whether it was
[1:19:38] financial, physical,
[1:19:42] whether they're shadowed unto death.
[1:19:46] Brother Brenham says many of the time,
[1:19:48] hey, I see it's a dark shadow or I see
[1:19:52] there's a lie that's told against you.
[1:19:54] On and on so many situation. I see your
[1:19:56] husband. I see your children. I see you
[1:19:59] in a doctor's office. He goes on and on.
[1:20:02] There's so many multitudes of things
[1:20:05] because within the body of Christ are
[1:20:08] many needs
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; and too much of the time we are not
[1:20:13] aware that God is mindful of where
[1:20:16] you're at.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; He said I'll be with you even in you
[1:20:20] until
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; the end of the world. So
[1:20:24] you know sometimes well you don't
[1:20:27] understand you know this is a life and
[1:20:30] death situation. and this, you know,
[1:20:33] well, I want all of you I I began to
[1:20:35] study this the other day and I found it
[1:20:37] quite interesting. Brother Brandham
[1:20:39] said, we're all dying.
[1:20:43] He says, you know what he said, man is
[1:20:47] given a a period of time 60
[1:20:50] three score in 10 years, 70 years.
[1:20:53] That's if you're good to your parents.
[1:20:55] Okay.
[1:20:56] So he says, "So you're given this amount
[1:20:59] of time
[1:21:01] and he says that
[1:21:05] some of you God
[1:21:08] will allow you to go through certain
[1:21:10] things." He said, "But actually after
[1:21:12] you are older than 21,"
[1:21:16] he said, "you start dying."
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Anyone here over 21?
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; If you're over 21, guess what? You're
[1:21:24] dying.
[1:21:27] Now, how soon you're going to go off the
[1:21:28] scene, I don't know. Some of you may be
[1:21:30] in a car wreck, plane wreck. You may
[1:21:32] drown. You may be hit by a car going
[1:21:35] across the street. And a lot of us think
[1:21:37] we're going to live forever
[1:21:40] in this mortal realm. Let me tell you,
[1:21:43] our days are numbered.
[1:21:46] So what you do from your birth until
[1:21:49] that time,
[1:21:51] okay, depends on how you're going to
[1:21:54] look at at God's will for your life.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; God understands what you're going
[1:21:59] through.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; He knows the situation you're in. And if
[1:22:04] you'll be mindful,
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; then there's deliverance.
[1:22:09] Job when he was in the belly of the
[1:22:11] whale,
[1:22:13] he said, "If I look at these lying
[1:22:18] vanities,
[1:22:20] I forsake my own deliverance."
[1:22:23] Now, I'll tell you what, of all the
[1:22:25] situations within scripture,
[1:22:29] that's the most claustrophobic
[1:22:32] stinking.
[1:22:34] I wouldn't have wanted to been swallowed
[1:22:37] by a whale. This is not Walt Disney with
[1:22:41] floating on a little raft inside and got
[1:22:43] a a candle and it's lit and you can see
[1:22:46] what's going on. No, he's wrapped in
[1:22:48] seaweed swallowed and gastric acids are
[1:22:51] starting to eat him and it stinks and
[1:22:54] whoa, how did I get here? And and he
[1:22:57] says, "THIS IS LYING VANITIES." WHAT WAS
[1:22:59] TELLING HIM THAT'S LYING VANITIES?
[1:23:03] THERE WAS SOMETHING HE SAID, "IF I WILL
[1:23:04] TURN MY FACE TOWARDS THE HOLY CITY, GOD
[1:23:08] WILL HEAR." LET ME TELL YOU, YOU JUST
[1:23:10] TURN ONE TIME. YOU JUST ASK GOD
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; AND WATCH HIM COME ON THE SCENE.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, YOU'LL DIE IN YOUR
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; LYING VANITY.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; I SAY LOOK UNTO GOD. HAVE FAITH IN GOD.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Turned his face towards a holy city. And
[1:23:31] guess what? It was all in God's purpose.
[1:23:34] God took him and had him. He was
[1:23:36] supposed to go to Nineveh.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; But he went to Tarsus.
[1:23:41] How many of you said, "Well, Tarsus
[1:23:44] seems a whole lot easier road than
[1:23:46] Nineveh because I don't want to go
[1:23:48] there. I don't want to have to preach to
[1:23:50] those people and tell them to repent."
[1:23:52] So anyway, God swallows him up, takes a
[1:23:55] personal taxi, three-day, puts him up
[1:23:58] onto the beach, and and guess what?
[1:24:00] Nineveh worshiped the whale.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; And so out of the mouth of God, imagine
[1:24:07] here comes this big huge whale and he
[1:24:10] beats himself, his lower jaw,
[1:24:14] and out of the here vomits. Out of the
[1:24:17] mouth of God comes a prophet. He stands
[1:24:20] up. He cle clears the seaweed. He goes
[1:24:23] like this. Where am I? They say Nineveh
[1:24:26] repent.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, they repented with
[1:24:31] sackcloth and ashes even on their
[1:24:33] animals.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; All things will work together for the
[1:24:41] good to them that love God. DID NOT SAY
[1:24:43] they were God good,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; but he will use it for his good.
[1:24:49] Quit trying to ask why. Why me? Why
[1:24:51] this? WHY THAT TRIAL? WHY? HEY, THINK IT
[1:24:54] NOT STRANGE AS THOUGH THESE FIERY
[1:24:57] TRIALS. OH, WHY did I deserve this? For
[1:24:59] what reason? Oh, I know why you're sick.
[1:25:01] Because you're mama, DAD. BECAUSE YOU
[1:25:03] did this. BECAUSE A STOP. THE DEVIL IS
[1:25:06] AN ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN. SOME OF YOU
[1:25:08] GET SICK ONLY FOR THE GLORY OF GOD.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, BROTHER. PREACH.
[1:25:16] BECAUSE GOD WANTS TO SHOW YOU HE'S
[1:25:19] JEHOVAH
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; RA. AMEN.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; NOW,
[1:25:30] so
[1:25:33] your faith, your faith that God gives
[1:25:36] you, it's a gift
[1:25:38] operates this messenger.
[1:25:45] That's why even when you listen to a
[1:25:47] tape
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; and here it is after the fact and you're
[1:25:52] sitting there and he might have preached
[1:25:53] this in 1963 and he's preaching and it's
[1:25:56] so current.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You feel like man this this is me. This
[1:26:01] is my situation. God is speaking to me.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; I began to look what the Apostle Paul
[1:26:10] said in the breadth and the length and
[1:26:12] the height. I I thought, well, wow, this
[1:26:16] is this is not onedimensional.
[1:26:20] Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Too much too much of the time, you and I
[1:26:24] as Christians live in a one-dimensional
[1:26:28] realm.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; And it's hard for us to comprehend
[1:26:34] of this that's going on around us.
[1:26:38] But how can this great apostle declare
[1:26:42] to the elect of that day to get out of
[1:26:44] carnal and intellectual thinking?
[1:26:47] Because I want you to come to the very
[1:26:49] knowledge of God himself.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And what does the apostle mean by the
[1:26:56] breadth, the length, the depth and
[1:26:58] height of the love of God?
[1:27:01] Because our imagination CAN JUST BARELY
[1:27:04] GRASP that in its entirety.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; OUR LITTLE FINITE MINDS are just exactly
[1:27:11] that, finite.
[1:27:13] But God is infinite
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; and all of you need to have an upgrade
[1:27:19] from God.
[1:27:21] And that is to give you revelation so
[1:27:23] you can come out of your finite thinking
[1:27:26] and start thinking about infinite
[1:27:28] things. Quit sitting so much of the time
[1:27:32] in your little realm.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; I want you to change dimensions. Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Some of you while I'm preaching
[1:27:44] well actually all of a sudden something
[1:27:47] is being said. You will be jettisoned
[1:27:49] invisible
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; to those around you. But you know you've
[1:27:53] been caught up into heavenly places in
[1:27:56] Christ Jesus
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL GO
[1:28:01] WOW
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; that so quickened me.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; What were you doing? changing
[1:28:09] dimensions. Didn't even know it.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; You were catching revelation from your
[1:28:15] heavenly father and upon this rock I'll
[1:28:17] build my church.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; So how is it that we could catch this
[1:28:28] breadth and length? And I looked at each
[1:28:30] one of these. So, let me for just a
[1:28:33] moment kind of expound on the breadth
[1:28:36] and the length and these other two
[1:28:40] dimensions. Again, they're dimensions.
[1:28:43] And while my wife and my daughter and I
[1:28:45] were reading this very scripture,
[1:28:48] it was so quicken to me. I said, "Wow,
[1:28:52] the Apostle Paul is making God
[1:28:55] multi-dimensional.
[1:28:57] Let's look at the breath. That's a
[1:29:00] dimension.
[1:29:02] it the breath that understand is this
[1:29:04] supernatural girdle
[1:29:08] that wraps the seed gene of God in its
[1:29:11] elective love.
[1:29:14] How can you understand that?
[1:29:17] That God before the foundation of the
[1:29:19] world loved you and put a ring on your
[1:29:21] finger and that wow that that that's
[1:29:25] pretty big, is it not?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Or the length
[1:29:31] It reaches from the eternal purpose and
[1:29:36] mission of Christ himself,
[1:29:38] bringing it all the way from the
[1:29:40] conception in the mind of God to a
[1:29:43] PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION HERE ON EARTH.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; IT TAKES YOU to eternity.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; HOW LONG IS THIS THEN? YEAH.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; From
[1:29:59] eternity to eternity
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; to infinity
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; and beyond.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; You talk about length.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; It keeps unfolding.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; It reaches all the way from infinity
[1:30:21] back to infinity.
[1:30:24] NO WONDER CHRIST COULD SAY, "I came from
[1:30:26] God."
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; And I go back to God.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; It's depth all the way down to the
[1:30:36] lowest fallen estate
[1:30:38] of Adam and his seed after him.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Goes to the very lowest of hell. David
[1:30:48] said, "Though I make my bed in hell,
[1:30:53] Thou art with me.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Talk. And you say, "Well, I'm so down.
[1:30:59] I'm so depressed."
[1:31:01] You can't get down far enough that God
[1:31:04] can't outreach you.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO GET OUT OF YOUR little one
[1:31:16] dimensional mind about here right now
[1:31:18] and me and woe is me.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. to start thinking about this depth
[1:31:25] of God.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; He'll go to any measure
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; to get you.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And he reaches from the highest
[1:31:38] mountain
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; and he goes to the lowest
[1:31:45] hell.
[1:31:51] Let it go beyond the song.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Let it become a reality.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; I know the pit the the pit from whence I
[1:32:01] was dug. How many of you can say, "God,
[1:32:04] HE REACHED WAY DOWN FOR ME."
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; WAY DOWN.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; OH, WAY DOWN. NO MATTER WHAT I DID, NO
[1:32:12] MATTER HOW BAD I GOT, NO MATTER HOW FAR
[1:32:14] INTO HELL I BECAME, PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:32:17] AMEN.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; GOD REACHED.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; WAY DOWN FOR ME.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; What amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THAT'S TRUE. WHAT A SAVIOR.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; WHAT A MIGHTY GOD I SERVE.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; And the height.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY THE DEPTH, BUT THE HEIGHT.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; That he would take you into
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; the heaven of heavens. Yes,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; there were men in scriptures Paul said
[1:32:51] there was a man who was caught up into
[1:32:53] the seventh heaven
[1:32:55] whether in body or out of body I don't
[1:32:57] know
[1:33:01] dimensional change
[1:33:04] I want you to understand saints of God
[1:33:06] there are even dimensions in heaven
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; he said the bride and only the bride
[1:33:12] that electing of God that's got the holy
[1:33:15] Holy Ghost that comes to the place of
[1:33:17] adoption will live in that new
[1:33:21] Jerusalem.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; The rest foolish virgin
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; and all of the rest that have eternal
[1:33:30] life
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; but they're not bride
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; are going to be outside the city.
[1:33:38] But that elect lady.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; So
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that the height
[1:33:48] of this love of God
[1:33:51] is taking the elect from the lowest hell
[1:33:53] to the highest height of heaven itself.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; And to the eternal glories of God.
[1:34:04] Now, yesterday while I was studying
[1:34:07] yesterday morning, Brother Tom Weathers
[1:34:09] from Flagstaff,
[1:34:11] one of the brothers that
[1:34:14] we brought to the message years ago, a
[1:34:15] bunch of us, we stopped and visited with
[1:34:17] him
[1:34:19] and shared with him about the message.
[1:34:21] Well, anyway, he called me up. He said,
[1:34:22] "Brother Ron, I I just was down. I had
[1:34:25] the they they had a men's breakfast over
[1:34:27] there at Phoenix Tabernacle and
[1:34:29] different ones." And he he he said, you
[1:34:32] know, and I've been involved with
[1:34:34] Harmony in the Desert and so on and so
[1:34:36] forth. So he said I was there, but he
[1:34:38] said, "It would be a shame, Brother Ron,
[1:34:40] that I'm in your backyard and I at least
[1:34:42] don't call you." Well, Brother Tom,
[1:34:45] because this is always Brother Tom. Hi,
[1:34:48] Brother Ron. This is Brother Tom.
[1:34:52] Hi, Brother Tom. Anyway, we just get to
[1:34:55] visit and he said,
[1:34:58] "Brother Ron, I'm just praying that God
[1:35:00] will give you something extra special,
[1:35:03] something supernatural tomorrow to share
[1:35:06] with you." I'm paraphrasing
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; to share with your sheep that God has
[1:35:11] got you over. I said, "Well, I I said,
[1:35:16] you know what? I want to talk about dis
[1:35:18] I I I want to talk about dimensional
[1:35:21] change.
[1:35:23] and how that we're changing dimension.
[1:35:27] He said, "Wow, it's interesting you said
[1:35:30] that." Now, don't use my name or a
[1:35:32] footnote in your sermon. Sorry, Tom, but
[1:35:35] it's okay.
[1:35:37] He says, "But he said, uh, I just
[1:35:40] learned something about what's called
[1:35:42] spatial awareness."
[1:35:45] Any of you a master of spatial
[1:35:48] awareness? Do you even know what it is?
[1:35:52] So I said, 'What is spatial awareness?
[1:35:57] He says, it is the ability to understand
[1:36:00] and recognize what's going on around
[1:36:02] you.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Now, most of you are like Mr. Mcoo.
[1:36:09] Oh,
[1:36:11] and everything's going AND YOU GOT NO
[1:36:13] IDEA OF ALL that's going on around you
[1:36:16] and you're not aware that sometimes
[1:36:18] you're visited by angels unaware.
[1:36:22] You're encompassed BY SUCH A CLOUD OF
[1:36:24] WITNESSES
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD is supernaturally visiting with
[1:36:28] you and you're just bbing
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; and you've got no spatial awareness.
[1:36:36] You're not cognizant of what's going on
[1:36:38] around you.
[1:36:42] So he shared with me he said
[1:36:45] babies
[1:36:47] he says medical doctors tell us babies
[1:36:50] are not born with spa spatial awareness
[1:36:55] he says let me give you an idea of this
[1:36:59] he said babies when they're born their
[1:37:02] cerebral cortex
[1:37:05] you nurses listen carefully
[1:37:08] he says their cerebral cortex effect is
[1:37:11] not developed.
[1:37:13] It only recognizes see, taste, smell,
[1:37:17] feel, and hear.
[1:37:19] And they have no idea of spatial
[1:37:23] awareness.
[1:37:26] So you tell a little baby, "Mommy
[1:37:30] is not here. She's in the other room."
[1:37:34] That little baby keeps crying
[1:37:37] because mommy is not here. Another room.
[1:37:40] I don't know. Another room. I want
[1:37:42] mommy.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. Mommy is coming in 45 minutes. And
[1:37:50] baby sits here and go, "Okay, thank you
[1:37:52] for telling me.
[1:37:55] I will time it." NO. BABY GOES, "I HAVE
[1:37:59] NO IDEA. 45 MINUTES, MAMA." NO.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; NO SPATIAL AWARENESS.
[1:38:08] SO THE cerebral cortex of a baby
[1:38:12] doesn't really recognize its
[1:38:14] surroundings. IT'S ONLY SUBJECT TO FIVE
[1:38:16] PHYSICAL SENSES.
[1:38:19] And he and then brother Tom said, "But
[1:38:22] the the doctors tell us that the
[1:38:24] cerebral cortex
[1:38:26] begins to develop with age."
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm hoping I'm talking to some of
[1:38:35] you that have come to full age.
[1:38:39] Okay. That your understanding that you
[1:38:42] just don't sit there and have no spatial
[1:38:45] awareness that you that your cerebral
[1:38:48] cortex WOULD NEVER BE MOVED ON BY FAITH
[1:38:52] AND YOU GO BEYOND THESE FIVE SENSES THAT
[1:38:56] YOU SIT IN YOUR EMBRYIONIC FORM. IT'S ME
[1:38:59] AND ALL ABOUT ME AND WOE IS ME.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:08] It's like the guy that, you know, he
[1:39:10] prayed, I think it was a flood or a
[1:39:12] storm and, you know, he sat on his roof
[1:39:16] and he's going to die and oh God, don't
[1:39:19] you love me? Send me a,
[1:39:21] you know, somebody to rescue me. Long
[1:39:24] comes a guy with a boat. Hey, hey, I
[1:39:27] come to rescue people. That's okay. I
[1:39:29] ask God, lets him go. And several things
[1:39:33] like this. You all know the story.
[1:39:36] Finally, the waters get so high. He has
[1:39:38] shunned everyone that was sent to him to
[1:39:42] get him out of his circumstance. But he
[1:39:44] said, "No, God. God's going to do it."
[1:39:46] Some of you are so unaware in your
[1:39:50] spatial
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; true
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; deadness
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; that God sends people. Somebody calls
[1:39:57] you on the phone. Somebody talks to you,
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; somebody preaches to you a sermon,
[1:40:01] somebody sings you a song, somebody does
[1:40:02] something Huh? And you're so aware,
[1:40:05] well, God, God's going to deliver me.
[1:40:07] And finally, the guy drowns.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Gets up in heaven and he says, "But God,
[1:40:12] I was so waiting on you. You were, you
[1:40:14] know, I had faith in you." And he said,
[1:40:15] "I sent you several deliverers and you
[1:40:17] refused them.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of you
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; God has done exactly the same thing.
[1:40:25] You're praying for your dilemma, your,
[1:40:28] you know, this, and you're WAITING FOR
[1:40:30] GOD. GOD SENDS SOME SEVERAL THINGS BY
[1:40:32] YOU, but you're so narcissistic in your
[1:40:35] viewpoint.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:40:44] the reason of our lack of understanding
[1:40:46] is because of spatial awareness.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; You got to grow up. You got to mature.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; So, show me this in scripture. You want
[1:40:54] to see it in scriptures? Because babies
[1:40:56] do not understand. They have no spatial
[1:40:58] awareness.
[1:41:00] Okay. 1 Corinthians 13:es 9-12. For we
[1:41:05] know in part
[1:41:09] G.
[1:41:12] Huh? We know in part
[1:41:15] and we prophesy in part.
[1:41:19] But when that which is perfect come,
[1:41:22] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:41:24] away with. When I was a child,
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; I understood everything.
[1:41:30] No, I thought as a child, I spake as a
[1:41:33] child. Understood as a child, I thought
[1:41:35] as a child. But when I became a man,
[1:41:39] that means maturity.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Cerebral cortexing.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; I start thinking,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; I START HAVING SPATIAL awareness because
[1:41:51] my maturity level has me to UNDERSTAND
[1:41:55] THAT I'M NOT SUBJECT JUST TO THIS
[1:41:58] SPATIAL REALM around me.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, BUT WE'RE SURROUNDED. WE'RE GOING TO
[1:42:04] DIE. OH, GOD. OPEN THE EYES of my
[1:42:07] servant to let him see spatial
[1:42:10] awareness. There's more of us than there
[1:42:12] is.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Hope her mother died. Or was it me? I
[1:42:25] forget.
[1:42:28] Mother died and she was so distraught
[1:42:30] and just so discouraged. Oh, mama's so
[1:42:33] far away. No, she's not. She's right
[1:42:36] here
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; in another
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; dimension.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; He said that other dimension's just
[1:42:44] faster.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that revelation then is
[1:42:51] changing your dimension from this slow
[1:42:54] carnal thinking? Because carnal thinking
[1:42:57] is emnity with God. NEITHER CAN IT
[1:42:59] UNDERSTAND GOD. SO GOD THEN GIVES YOU AN
[1:43:02] UPGRADE. You young boys listen to me.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; YOU TRY TO UNDERSTAND this message with
[1:43:07] an intellectual carnal understanding.
[1:43:10] You're just going to see rules and
[1:43:11] regulations and you miss it. Your little
[1:43:14] spatial
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; you need your cerebral cortex to grow
[1:43:20] up.
[1:43:25] Come on.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're going to just sit
[1:43:27] there and Well, the reason I go to
[1:43:30] church because mom and dad,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; the reason I'm here because when I turn
[1:43:34] 18, and you know what's so funny? So
[1:43:37] many of you, well, I can't wait. When I
[1:43:39] get out of the house, I'm going to be my
[1:43:41] own boss.
[1:43:44] Yeah. You're going to have your own
[1:43:45] house payment or you're going to pay
[1:43:47] your own rent. You're going to pay your
[1:43:49] own gas. You're going to do your own
[1:43:51] laundry. You're going to Yeah. I I just
[1:43:53] want to be free. I'll tell you what,
[1:43:56] some of you need a little bit of a
[1:43:58] freedom.
[1:44:00] All right, big guy. You're on your own.
[1:44:05] Don't do that to me. I need gas money
[1:44:07] this week.
[1:44:11] Huh? I I'm short. Mom, Dad, will you
[1:44:16] You're MY OFFSPRING NOW. SPRING ON.
[1:44:21] YOU GOT TO GROW UP. GOT TO QUIT
[1:44:23] THINKING. WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I SPAKE. I
[1:44:26] understood. I acted LIKE A CHILD. QUIT
[1:44:29] ACTING CHILDISH.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; QUIT ACTING FOOLISH.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Become a man.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; For now, we see through a glass. Watch
[1:44:42] this. We see through a glass darkly.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, I can't hardly see it.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; But then face to face.
[1:44:51] Now I know in part,
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; but then I shall know
[1:44:56] even as I am known.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; So a greater understanding, a higher
[1:45:01] dimension than this little realm,
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; huh?
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Of you.
[1:45:10] Everything centers around you.
[1:45:16] I hope that you parents
[1:45:19] do not make your child the center of the
[1:45:21] universe.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; It's not all about them.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; And it's okay that they suffer once in a
[1:45:29] while.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:45:33] it is. If they bang up their car, you
[1:45:37] fix it, buddy.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; It's your car. You did it. Yeah. Well, I
[1:45:40] parked it too close. Yeah. And somebody
[1:45:42] else b
[1:45:45] fix it. Do you understand what you do?
[1:45:50] Parents don't parent too well.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, let them suffer a little
[1:45:56] bit.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let them understand the value of a
[1:46:00] dollar. If you keep bailing them out,
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; then they will have this welfare
[1:46:05] mentality their whole life. EVERYBODY
[1:46:08] OWES ME SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, THE BOSS,
[1:46:09] HE DOESN'T LIKE ME AND I DON'T GET PAID
[1:46:11] ENOUGH AND I WISH I HAD A JOB AND I I
[1:46:14] WANT TO BE THE MANAGER OF THIS PLACE.
[1:46:15] OH,
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; if you're going to start on the job, you
[1:46:21] start at the bottom and you work your
[1:46:23] way up. It's called apprenticeship.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; You don't become a journeyman overnight.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Start at the bottom and usually with a
[1:46:34] broom.
[1:46:35] This ain't
[1:46:38] I want to be electrician. You just got
[1:46:40] me cleaning up. It's so funny how young
[1:46:44] kids come onto the job with dad and
[1:46:47] dad's a plumber, electrician, a
[1:46:49] carpenter, and said, "Yeah, when I was a
[1:46:51] little kid, I I you know, I learned
[1:46:54] plumbing from my dad." Oh, you did?
[1:46:59] How much plumbing did you do?
[1:47:03] Well, I carried the PVC pipe.
[1:47:07] I carried the basket of the joints
[1:47:09] because I don't know a 60deree elbow
[1:47:13] from a 45 degree elbow.
[1:47:16] I don't
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, man. I used to help help dad my
[1:47:21] kids. Yeah. I used to help my dad on the
[1:47:23] job. We framing. Yeah, I know all about
[1:47:25] framing. When did they ever frame with
[1:47:28] daddy? You know what I did? I had him
[1:47:29] clean up.
[1:47:31] go clean up all the, you know, 2x4 ends
[1:47:33] and 2 by six's and everything like that.
[1:47:36] Yeah, we helped dad frame. You never did
[1:47:38] framed at all. You understand? But we
[1:47:40] have a tendency because we were there
[1:47:42] when daddy was doing it. We thought we
[1:47:44] were doing it.
[1:47:47] Okay.
[1:47:49] We are so limited because of our carnal
[1:47:51] minds.
[1:47:55] So we're limited in our ability to go
[1:47:59] beyond our five
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; physical senses.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; So the prophet of God is that window
[1:48:07] is that channel
[1:48:10] that God allows you to see into that
[1:48:12] other realm. Now brother Brandham likens
[1:48:16] his gift. He said now he said we come to
[1:48:18] a fence and on the other side of the
[1:48:21] fence is a circus
[1:48:24] and he said and there's only one little
[1:48:25] knot hole in the fence and everybody
[1:48:27] can't look through the knot hole at the
[1:48:29] same time. So he says would you lift me
[1:48:32] up and he says there with my gift I pull
[1:48:35] you up and I you look over the fence and
[1:48:38] you go yeah I see hey don't let me down
[1:48:41] come on hey.
[1:48:44] So he says, "So what I do is I lift you
[1:48:46] up."
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that while he's
[1:48:49] preaching,
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; he's getting so weak cuz he's Do you see
[1:48:57] it?
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? I'm I'm a window. CAN CAN
[1:49:01] YOU SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? I HOPE
[1:49:04] YOU'RE CATCHING IT.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S HE'S lifting you up
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; now.
[1:49:14] Isn't it a lot easier in church age?
[1:49:17] Let me move on. I I I know that I'm a
[1:49:20] wee bit scattered from here and there.
[1:49:23] And like I said, there's so much that I
[1:49:26] have on my heart. I realize I cannot say
[1:49:29] it all in one service. I will not
[1:49:31] attempt to.
[1:49:33] So loud easy in church age. Watch this.
[1:49:37] Now he is the true witness.
[1:49:41] Now this word true is the same word we
[1:49:44] saw back there in Revelation 3 and7.
[1:49:47] You recall that it does not mean true as
[1:49:51] in contrast to false.
[1:49:54] It has a richer deeper meaning by far.
[1:49:58] It expresses perfect realization in
[1:50:01] contrast to partial realization.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Now back in Philadelphia age the coming
[1:50:09] of Lords was drawing nigh. What great
[1:50:11] love that age manifested for him. It
[1:50:14] reminds me of those beautiful words in 1
[1:50:16] Peter 1:8. Whom having not seen we love
[1:50:19] and whom we uh though now you see him
[1:50:23] not yet believing we rejoice with joy
[1:50:26] unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:50:29] And then them we re with them we rejoice
[1:50:33] also.
[1:50:35] We haven't seen him but we felt him. We
[1:50:39] know him now as much as our limiting
[1:50:42] senses
[1:50:44] can let us.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; As much as our limiting senses will let
[1:50:51] us. But one day it will be face to face.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; That's for this age.
[1:50:59] He is coming at the end of this age.
[1:51:01] Partial realization will be made perfect
[1:51:04] realization complete realization.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have been looking through
[1:51:10] a glass darkly, but soon it'll be face
[1:51:12] to face.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; We've been going from glory to glory,
[1:51:16] but soon it'll be right in
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; the glory and his glory will shine. We
[1:51:22] shall be like him and wondrously like
[1:51:24] him. Jesus, our savior divine. Isn't
[1:51:27] that wonderful?
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; We are complete in him. That's true.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; He would not lie to us about that. But
[1:51:33] one day we will be changed in these
[1:51:36] atoms. Amen.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; What a time that's going to be.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Right now, you have the earnest of your
[1:51:43] inheritance. And you don't get the
[1:51:45] fullness of your inheritance until the
[1:51:47] first resurrection.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; He just gives you the earnest. You're
[1:51:56] not changed completely. In fact, you got
[1:51:58] a battle.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; You got a battle going on. And your
[1:52:03] little spatial awareness
[1:52:06] is so limited that God has to keep
[1:52:08] giving you revelation. Hey, hey, don't
[1:52:11] look at the situations.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the issues that are around
[1:52:16] you because if you do, you forsake your
[1:52:18] own
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; deliverance.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, open your eyes.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart. Lord,
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; I want to see you.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul love all he goes and he
[1:52:42] finds all of these quotes and he sends
[1:52:44] them. How many of you are on his little
[1:52:47] email list?
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah, man. I tell you what, this guy
[1:52:51] gets into good stuff.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Good stuff.
[1:52:54] He says, "Do you know what, brother Ron?
[1:52:58] This message woke up a bride."
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; It's a woke generation.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Wow.

[1:53:11] PROFOUND EFFECT UPON YOU. IT WOKE YOU
[1:53:14] UP. IT MADE YOU
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; COME TO A MATURITY LEVEL. AMEN. THAT
[1:53:18] IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOUR OWN LITTLE
[1:53:20] WORLD, ABOUT YOUR LITTLE career and
[1:53:23] about how much MONEY YOU MAKE AND WHAT
[1:53:25] HOUSE YOU LIVE IN.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF THAT
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; AND LOOK AND UNDERSTAND, SEEK YE FIRST
[1:53:33] THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS
[1:53:35] RIGHTEOUSNESS.

[1:53:41] want you to NOT HAVE TO SUFFER too much,
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; but he said in suffering you're going to
[1:53:48] learn.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; pain is a real motivator. You know that?
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Suffering's a motivator, too.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you create your own suffering.
[1:54:10] Oh, I tell you what, I don't like living
[1:54:12] in the city.
[1:54:14] I WISH I HAD ME ACORAGE OUT IN WAY OUT

[1:55:02] And I pray that THIS REALLY GOOD JOB
[1:55:04] THAT EARNS me money is only a few miles
[1:55:07] from my boondock house.

[1:55:21] what? You got a mortgage.
[1:55:25] You got a wife. You love her.
[1:55:29] She has kids.

[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; It was It was pretty easy when it was
[1:55:37] just two mouths to feed, huh? And you
[1:55:40] was king of the hill,
[1:55:44] man. You came home, the wife gave you
[1:55:46] all the attention. Hey, come rub my
[1:55:48] neck. Hey, come over here. Oh, hey,
[1:55:51] let's go out to dinner tonight. It all
[1:55:53] changes
[1:55:55] after them kids arrive.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; And guess what? You ain't king of the
[1:56:00] hill anymore,
[1:56:02] honey. You know you want a little
[1:56:05] attention. the kids.

[1:56:31] to take care of the kids. You got to
[1:56:32] feed them.
[1:56:37] I took a brother.
[1:56:39] I let a a brother his kids came with us
[1:56:42] one time to to go out to eat. So there
[1:56:46] was three of the kids and they came with
[1:56:48] us and I said, "Hey," I says, "You guys
[1:56:50] can order whatever you want." Really?
[1:56:56] Really? Our daddy makes us share a happy
[1:56:59] meal.
[1:57:01] I said, "No." Hey,
[1:57:04] I said order anything you want. Anything
[1:57:07] up to $3. And you're
[1:57:14] all of you understand
[1:57:17] that as you grow and you mature, great
[1:57:19] are your responsibilities.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to get married, you want to
[1:57:23] have a nice house, you want to drive a
[1:57:24] nice car, huh? Yeah. Of course. Of
[1:57:29] course. And and we all like nice things.
[1:57:31] It's true. But if you're not careful,
[1:57:34] you bite off more than you can chew.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; And then you're you're woe is me. Oh, I
[1:57:41] work 14 hours a day and I just go to
[1:57:45] work Monday through Friday and Saturday
[1:57:48] I have to fix the house.
[1:57:52] Oh, come on. And Sunday, Sunday, I got
[1:57:55] to go to church.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Do you see? And then pretty soon, oh
[1:58:01] man, I just wish things would change. I
[1:58:04] wish I could just go fishing for a
[1:58:06] living.
[1:58:08] Yeah, that's what Peter did. He got so
[1:58:09] sick. I'm, you know, and I'm related to
[1:58:11] Peter, so I tell you, there's been a lot
[1:58:13] of times I said, I'm going fishing.
[1:58:16] Forget this stuff. Going fishing.
[1:58:20] So sometimes I make a fisherary trip.
[1:58:26] And I don't even tell you. I say it fast
[1:58:28] enough. You heard, huh, brother Minnow?
[1:58:33] A missionary trip. Really? I met Brother
[1:58:35] Menow and he's one of the most fun guys
[1:58:38] to fish with because he talks to every
[1:58:40] fish that comes on his line. Oh. Oh,
[1:58:43] look at this. Oh, yeah. This is a big
[1:58:45] one. I got it on video. Yeah. Yeah. Oh,
[1:58:48] yeah. Yeah. Come to papa. Here he is.
[1:58:51] You know. Oh, no. He's not so big. No.
[1:58:53] No. No man. I tell you, get the net.
[1:58:59] And then we had a couple boats.
[1:59:03] Dear Darren was with us. We had a couple
[1:59:06] boats of brothers. And I tell you what,
[1:59:08] when you get brothers that are fishing,
[1:59:11] they're liars.
[1:59:14] We're catching we're catching a 18-in
[1:59:17] walleye or pickrol. And somebody goes,
[1:59:20] "He's 24 in."
[1:59:23] I looked down. I said, "Are you kidding
[1:59:26] me? hat's only 18 in 16 in like that.
[1:59:29] Later we were having dinner and so we're
[1:59:32] sitting around and the brother
[1:59:36] very prominent minister.
[1:59:40] He said I told him I I called him on it.
[1:59:44] I said Dwayne Lawson.
[1:59:47] Oh, excuse me. I shouldn't have said
[1:59:49] that. I said Dwayne YOU WERE LYING TO
[1:59:52] THOSE GUYS IN THE OTHER BOAT. YOU WERE
[1:59:54] How could you do it? He said, "Brother
[1:59:56] Ron, I have learned that you never let a
[1:59:59] good fish story
[2:00:01] go by by having to tell the truth."
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, once in a while, we have an
[2:00:10] exception
[2:00:13] when we go fishing.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Dwayne, if he hears this, he's going to
[2:00:20] be upset with me. But I told him, I
[2:00:21] said, "Yeah, I I learned it from you,
[2:00:23] Dwayne. I can lie. I can tell these guys
[2:00:25] it's 36 in when it's only 16 or
[2:00:29] something. Now
[2:00:34] watch this. Now faith, this is six
[2:00:36] cents. I'm trying to bring this to a
[2:00:38] close. Give me about 10 more minutes.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; You need to recognize your day and your
[2:00:47] hour.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Now we're not looking for another
[2:00:51] messenger.
[2:00:54] We're not looking for another prophet to
[2:00:55] come on the scene. There's only seven
[2:00:57] church ages, seven messengers. Are are
[2:01:00] we together on that? Okay.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Not we're not looking for this messenger
[2:01:05] to return because he didn't finish his
[2:01:07] ministry.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to show you some
[2:01:13] things of what he said.
[2:01:16] So
[2:01:20] the true bride. I I I'm going to declare
[2:01:23] something that the true bride will catch
[2:01:26] a true revelation of who she is.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; It's happening.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; It's happening to every one of us. This
[2:01:36] is not a movement of man or of church.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; This is a movement of God.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; It is God doing it. It's God giving you
[2:01:47] revelation. It's God quickening it. It's
[2:01:49] God giving you. And you could be doing
[2:01:51] your dishes. You could BE DRIVING YOUR
[2:01:53] CAR. YOU BE TAKING care of the kids. You
[2:01:55] could be listening to a sermon. You
[2:01:57] could BE TAKING A WALK IN GOD. ALL OF A
[2:01:59] SUDDEN, WHAML.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; WOO. WOW. He just gave ME A REVELATION.
[2:02:05] HOW WONDERFUL.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE JETTISONED AT THAT VERY
[2:02:08] MOMENT UP INTO HEAVENLY places
[2:02:12] in Christ Jesus. What is he doing? He's
[2:02:14] changing your dimension.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Understand this now. that Enoch
[2:02:20] walked in his revelation, did he not?
[2:02:22] Brother Brim said he was walking with
[2:02:24] God.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; He said, but his revelation got so great
[2:02:28] that one day.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; He said he put his foot up and it didn't
[2:02:32] come down.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; He said he stepped into another
[2:02:37] dimension.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Let me declare unto you right now.
[2:02:44] Listen to me.
[2:02:46] We're stepping right now.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Every one of you, I'm including all of
[2:02:51] you. I'm
[2:02:54] wanting to make all of you bride,
[2:02:57] but you're stepping into
[2:02:59] revelation that you never had before.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; And it's causing you to change.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; You're changing dimensions
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; because the rapture is happening.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:14] Listen, WE'RE WE'RE WAITING FOR THE
[2:03:16] FINAL LAST minute of the change of our
[2:03:19] bodies. Right?
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Until then, you're going to be changed
[2:03:24] little by little. Here a little, here a
[2:03:27] little, THERE A LITTLE. GOD IS CHANGING
[2:03:29] YOU. HE'S HE'S WASHING YOU BY THE WATER
[2:03:32] OF THE WORD. And you're being changed.
[2:03:34] I've been changed.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:40] He's changing me from glory to glory.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; He's changing me
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; until one day I'm going to step into
[2:03:50] that change.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:03:58] Let me declare to you
[2:04:02] and you realize something.
[2:04:04] The bride
[2:04:06] has come to that day. Amen.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; It's here.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a time off. We're
[2:04:15] not going back and looking what God has
[2:04:17] done. We're seeing what God is doing
[2:04:19] presently.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to become
[2:04:23] multi-dimensional
[2:04:24] in your understanding because God is
[2:04:27] sharing with you revelation bringing you
[2:04:30] from your little onedimension
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; that you MIGHT KNOW THE HEIGHT, THE
[2:04:34] BREADTH, THE LENGTH, ALL OF THIS THAT
[2:04:37] GOD WANTS TO SHARE WITH YOU THE fullness
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; of God himself.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; I was sharing with my wife Sandy. I said
[2:04:53] I said Sandy there is a season for a
[2:04:55] woman
[2:04:58] of when she can get pregnant. I said
[2:05:01] what what do you call that? She said
[2:05:03] well when a woman is fertile.
[2:05:07] I said, "Oh, so it's not
[2:05:12] 365 days a year
[2:05:15] of every month. There is a time period,
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; For a woman, you understand timing is
[2:05:24] everything with God.
[2:05:28] There is a time and a season where she
[2:05:30] is very fertile.
[2:05:35] And if during that time
[2:05:38] There is a union that takes place and
[2:05:41] the seed is passed. She will take that
[2:05:44] and it will quicken
[2:05:47] THAT LIFE INSIDE OF HER AND SHE MAY NOT
[2:05:50] EVEN KNOW THAT IT HAPPENED, BUT SHE CAN
[2:05:52] TELL A FEW DAYS AFTER SOMETHING'S
[2:05:55] CHANGING. My tastes are changing,
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; I want to eat a pickle instead of ice
[2:06:01] cream.
[2:06:04] And then she begins to see within her
[2:06:06] body.
[2:06:08] She's realized, "Oh my, it's so funny.
[2:06:10] Sisters when they when they and it's
[2:06:12] their first baby and they get pregnant,
[2:06:14] they take a picture and it looks about
[2:06:17] like me right now.
[2:06:24] You can't even see it. There's not even
[2:06:26] a shadow." But
[2:06:29] until they get way out there and then
[2:06:34] nine
[2:06:36] months,
[2:06:38] when is this baby going to come?
[2:06:42] Yeah. I mean, hey, finally after they at
[2:06:45] the last week or two and they're they're
[2:06:47] so full
[2:06:49] that they
[2:06:52] my back you they used to walk like this.
[2:06:54] Now,
[2:06:58] now understand that there comes a time
[2:07:00] for this bride.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Let's be mature. Now, at a time of the
[2:07:07] uniting time and sign,
[2:07:10] she will be in a season of fertility
[2:07:16] and she will be able to conceive
[2:07:20] seed.
[2:07:22] Now I want you to understand that God
[2:07:24] had been speaking to Abraham
[2:07:26] all those years and for 25 years God had
[2:07:30] met with Abraham in supernatural ways.
[2:07:33] He came and spoke to him in the flesh as
[2:07:36] Melzdc. He had all these dreams and
[2:07:39] different things and God SPEAKING TO
[2:07:41] HIM, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE a son.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:47] And for 25 years, God's dealing with
[2:07:49] him. At no time was there a personal
[2:07:54] meeting that God had with Sarah. Doesn't
[2:07:58] speak to her. She's just a secondhand
[2:08:01] recipient
[2:08:02] of her husband.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:08:07] But the Bible says in the book of
[2:08:09] Hebrews,
[2:08:12] Hebrews 11, let me show you
[2:08:16] through faith
[2:08:19] also Sarah herself.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Now, she'd been receiving seed. There
[2:08:25] was nothing wrong with Abraham's
[2:08:28] message.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; There was nothing wrong with his seed.
[2:08:35] It was how she's receiving it.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; She had to come to a maturity
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; because God's not going to marry a
[2:08:45] little immature little girl.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; She's going to be a mature bride.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; And in her time of fertility,
[2:08:58] there's going to be an invisible union.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. through faith. Also
[2:09:05] Sarah herself received strength
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; to conceive seed
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; and was delivered of a child when she
[2:09:14] was past age. In other words, she was it
[2:09:16] was overdue.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Because she judged him faithful that had
[2:09:21] promised. Amen.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Wherefore sprang there even of one,
[2:09:26] and him as good as dead, so many as the
[2:09:28] stars of the sky in multitude, and in
[2:09:31] the sand, which is by the seashore,
[2:09:34] innumerable.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Because at the end, it looked like
[2:09:41] they're never going to produce seed
[2:09:43] because now they become as good as dead.
[2:09:50] Get out of your dimensional thinking
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; because when it looks impossible,
[2:09:58] that's a time when God makes the
[2:10:00] impossible possible.
[2:10:06] Now,
[2:10:09] she had to come to a time
[2:10:12] that she would be moved on by faith
[2:10:14] herself. Faith's revelation.
[2:10:17] So, now she's old enough, she's mature
[2:10:19] enough, she's not going to pass it off
[2:10:21] to another church.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; She's going to say, "Be it unto me."
[2:10:26] So, and I want you to to to catch this
[2:10:29] because this is extremely important
[2:10:33] in questions and answers in 1957.
[2:10:37] Now, someday I'm going to leave here.
[2:10:41] I'm wondering what will be my end.
[2:10:48] Is it over? Is it just about? I'm 48
[2:10:51] years old
[2:10:54] and it's just about over. I wonder this
[2:10:56] if it is. At 48, he was thinking he's an
[2:10:59] old man.
[2:11:01] I remember I came to the message when I
[2:11:03] was 18. Brother Brandham died. How old
[2:11:06] was he when he died? Anybody remember?
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; 56. You know what? I thought he's an old
[2:11:12] man.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Ancient of days.
[2:11:17] Now you to some of you guys, Brother
[2:11:19] Ron, he's ancient of bald-headed.
[2:11:22] Treasure chest is dropped.
[2:11:26] Yeah, he's he's had his day. 73, man.
[2:11:30] Ancient of days.
[2:11:32] But when you get older and you come to
[2:11:35] 56, 56, just a young man.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Now, I have to
[2:11:46] I have to admit
[2:11:49] 70 was when I really felt
[2:11:56] 55, no problem. 60, 65, no problem. 70,
[2:12:00] I hit a wall. P
[2:12:04] splat. You want to play pickle ball? Are
[2:12:08] you kidding me?
[2:12:10] The only place I run to anymore is to
[2:12:12] the dinner table or to the bathroom.
[2:12:16] How many of you used to run? Yeah, I
[2:12:19] used to come down here to Phoenix. Oh,
[2:12:21] it was because I used to run in
[2:12:23] Flagstaff 7 10 miles. No problem. When I
[2:12:27] came here to Phoenix and I lived down
[2:12:28] there in Awatuki, I would wait until the
[2:12:31] heat of the day, 110, 115 degrees, get
[2:12:34] outside, run.
[2:12:38] The heat OF THE DAY. OH, this is good. I
[2:12:42] look at guys now and I go, "Poor guy.
[2:12:45] It's going to happen one day.
[2:12:52] Yeah, little bodily exercise,
[2:12:55] but some of you need a little help.
[2:12:57] That's true.
[2:13:01] So, we're coming now to a season. I'm
[2:13:05] very much and I'm acutely aware of this.
[2:13:09] Brother Brandon said, "Look, why didn't
[2:13:12] the world realize that picture there?"
[2:13:14] And he about the pillar of fire above
[2:13:16] his head. Amen.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Why didn't they catch that right quick?
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Why they Why don't they catch these
[2:13:25] other things? Why don't they catch these
[2:13:27] prophecies and things?
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; You know, they can't do it right now,
[2:13:35] but one day I'm going to leave the
[2:13:36] world. And when I leave, you're going to
[2:13:38] recognize it.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Some of you young people will realize
[2:13:43] that after I'm gone.
[2:13:46] But God would not permit it to be done
[2:13:48] now.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, one day, Brother Menow,"
[2:13:55] he said, "After I'm gone," some of you
[2:13:58] young men, you were a young man back
[2:14:00] then,
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; sir,
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; probably in your 20s,
[2:14:04] married,
[2:14:05] you were just coming into the
[2:14:07] understanding,
[2:14:10] huh?
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "You young men have begin to
[2:14:13] catch this. I want all of you to
[2:14:15] understand
[2:14:17] that God had to take the forerunner off
[2:14:21] of the scene. What will be my end? What
[2:14:24] what is it? Do you think God made a
[2:14:25] mistake by taking the prophet off of the
[2:14:28] scene?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Because our eyes were so much on the
[2:14:34] messenger, we failed to take his
[2:14:36] message.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; So God now pulls him off of the scene.
[2:14:46] John the Baptist said, "I must decrease
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; that he must increase."
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; The emphasis on the messenger is
[2:14:57] decreasing. Understand this not taking
[2:15:00] away
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; because
[2:15:04] how dare we take away from that
[2:15:06] messenger that God sent.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; But now what about what did he say?
[2:15:13] So now we're getting our focus now as
[2:15:15] channeling
[2:15:17] of what the messenger said.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; That's why we have it on tape recording.
[2:15:23] And thank God we have it on tape because
[2:15:25] you know what? If it was all up to what
[2:15:27] people heard and what they understood,
[2:15:29] why there was so many different
[2:15:30] interpretations of what he said every
[2:15:32] time that he preached.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; Thank God we can go back. You want to
[2:15:36] know what he said on marriage and
[2:15:37] divorce? Play the tape.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:15:41] church order. Play the tape.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Put them in remembrance. I listen. I'm
[2:15:46] just here as a Timothy telling you what
[2:15:49] Paul said.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:25-29.
[2:15:59] Wherefore I'm made a minister according
[2:16:02] to the dispensation of God, which is
[2:16:04] given to me for you to fulfill
[2:16:17] to the mystery among the Gentiles, which
[2:16:19] is Christ in you,
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory,
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; whom we preach, warning every man and
[2:16:26] teaching every man in all wisdom.
[2:16:29] that we may present every man perfect or
[2:16:31] mature in Christ Jesus.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Where to I also labor driving striving
[2:16:37] according to his working which workketh
[2:16:40] in me
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; mightily
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; come up hither John.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a suggestion.
[2:16:55] It was a changing of dimension. Come up
[2:16:57] hither, John. John, John, get out of
[2:17:00] that little onedimensional thinking
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; and come up hither where I will show you
[2:17:06] things to come.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? Change dimensions.
[2:17:12] This message is causing you to change.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; It's changing you. And you're in a
[2:17:19] PROCESS RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE not done.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; You're in a transition.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:27] I have a little sign on you. I'm in
[2:17:29] transition. I ain't there yet, but I'm
[2:17:30] in transition.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; I haven't attained to where I want to
[2:17:34] be, but I'm going.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; You understand? I'm in the process in
[2:17:39] transition
[2:17:41] because he that begun a good work in me
[2:17:43] is going to finish it. And that is his
[2:17:46] business.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; And God is determined
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; that he's going to have a bride without
[2:17:52] spot and wrinkle. Amen.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; And the very fact that you are here
[2:17:57] today and you are under a ministry that
[2:18:00] is trying to preach to you what he said.
[2:18:03] You're coming to the time of a union.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD HAS DONE? HE
[2:18:08] CAME DOWN HERE THROUGH A PROPHET
[2:18:10] MESSENGER AND LET YOU KNOW THIS IS THE
[2:18:13] TIME TO UNITE WITH CHRIST THE WORD. AND
[2:18:16] WHEN YOU UNITE WITH YOUR HUSBAND,
[2:18:19] EVERYTHING HE HAS IS YOURS.
[2:18:34] musicians have become
[2:18:39] I want to bring this to
[2:18:41] a little summation here.
[2:18:46] Revelation is what God uses to move all
[2:18:49] of you into your position.
[2:18:54] all of you
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; without exception. If you're not being
[2:18:58] moved
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; into a position,
[2:19:02] you're not you're not his
[2:19:05] because God moves on each one of his.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; And if you are all if you are without
[2:19:12] chastisement,
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; you're none of his.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; That's why others can get away. Don't
[2:19:19] look at others what they do. They may
[2:19:21] get away with it. You You try it.
[2:19:24] Fivefold ministry.
[2:19:26] Why me? Well, because
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[2:19:31] I chose you.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; It's not you choosing me. I've chosen
[2:19:35] you.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Faith is the six stance.
[2:19:39] Our heavenly father, the six sense,
[2:19:41] these testimonies from the Bible to the
[2:19:43] six sense, as I call it, faith. I was
[2:19:47] reading Hebrews 11 of the six sense.
[2:19:50] Faith being the substance of things
[2:19:52] hoped for, the evidence of things that
[2:19:55] senses of the earth don't declare. And
[2:19:59] we see through there how they subdued
[2:20:04] kingdoms, stopped the mouths of lions,
[2:20:06] escaped the edge of the sword. Enoch was
[2:20:09] translated into heavenly
[2:20:12] into heaven by the six sense. Abraham
[2:20:16] sojourned in a strange land and received
[2:20:18] a son after he was 100 years old. Six
[2:20:22] sense when Sarah's womb was dead, he
[2:20:25] considered not those things. He
[2:20:27] staggered not that the promise of God
[2:20:29] through unbelief, but was strong, giving
[2:20:31] glory to God. He knowed God made the
[2:20:34] promise and God was fully persuaded God
[2:20:37] would keep what he had promised. God
[2:20:41] wake up that six sense
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; in this church among these people
[2:20:45] tonight
[2:20:47] when we see that you gave great sign to
[2:20:49] Abraham and there what taken place
[2:20:54] let them see the angel of the Lord's
[2:20:55] presence tonight
[2:20:58] and rely not upon their feeling
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; or upon their sight
[2:21:04] but upon the word of God that made the
[2:21:07] promise and every person in here will be
[2:21:09] healed.
[2:21:12] Everyone that's unsaved will be saved
[2:21:15] and all without the Holy Ghost will
[2:21:17] receive it. Hear me, Father. I pray in
[2:21:19] Jesus name.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; A prophet
[2:21:24] was a sign, a channel,
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; an opening, a window.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me? Do you do you believe
[2:21:34] me
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; to be God's prophet? And when you when
[2:21:39] you say yes, you know what you do?
[2:21:41] You're activating that window.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; And now you have an ability
[2:21:48] to become multi-dimensional
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; that you get out of your little selfish
[2:21:54] state. It's all about me and what I do
[2:21:56] and church is a convenience.
[2:21:59] Church will never be convenient.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; In fact, it's going to get harder and
[2:22:04] harder.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Church is a commitment.
[2:22:10] Takes a commitment to go to to follow
[2:22:12] God. Takes a commitment.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; You cannot ascend
[2:22:18] into a higher dimension
[2:22:21] by church attendance.
[2:22:26] Oh, well, I go to church. That's good.
[2:22:29] But what do you do when you're here?
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; You cannot come higher without your
[2:22:34] revelation pulling you.
[2:22:37] What do you think the third pull is?
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Had he right, all she did was hear a
[2:22:48] testimony.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; God did this and God did that. And she
[2:22:52] got so excited.
[2:22:54] It wasn't in a prayer line.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; It wasn't even in church. In fact, I'll
[2:22:59] have all of you to know that the five
[2:23:01] indications of the third pull was not
[2:23:03] done in church.
[2:23:11] That's nothing but the truth.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; She with her mouth activated
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; because SHE WAS REALIZING GOD'S PROPHET
[2:23:21] WAS THERE. THERE WAS A window
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; and he became
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; so ACTIVATED TO THIS PROPHET. He began
[2:23:31] to speak the word. He would speak and
[2:23:35] create.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what I wish to launch
[2:23:43] off into next.
[2:23:46] You know what God was doing through the
[2:23:48] ministry of this prophet?
[2:23:51] Creating himself a bride. How was he
[2:23:54] doing it? Line upon line. Precept upon
[2:23:58] precept. Tape upon tape. You know what
[2:24:01] he's doing? saying she'll have this
[2:24:03] character.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; She was a spoken word,
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; seed,
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; bride,
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; that makes you a part of him. He said,
[2:24:19] understand that this spoken word seed
[2:24:21] bride is as eternal as he is.
[2:24:28] You cannot die
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; no more than God can die.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. When the wheels of this mortal
[2:24:34] life stand still
[2:24:38] and you're transported, Brother Bram
[2:24:39] said death is only harnessing
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; to pull you into that other dimension.
[2:24:50] Brother Brennan, when he got over there,
[2:24:51] you know what he said? Did I fear this?
[2:24:54] You know what he feared? Going back.
[2:24:56] Don't send me back. Oh my, this is so
[2:25:00] great over here. You mean I feared this?
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Don't you fear it, saints? Yes.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Because he that hath the Son
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; hath life, and he that hath not the Son
[2:25:15] hath not life.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; You are as immortal as God himself.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; And the reason that God sent you this
[2:25:25] message
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; is to make you multi-dimensional
[2:25:30] in your thinking.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:42] Enoch walked with God. Hebrews 11:5-6.
[2:25:45] And this is my finishing statement.
[2:25:54] Excuse me.
[2:25:59] All right. Let's go to Hebrews. It's on
[2:26:02] the screen. By faith, Enoch was
[2:26:04] translated that he should not see death.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:08] and was not because God had translated
[2:26:11] him
[2:26:13] for before his translation. So before
[2:26:15] the event,
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; he had this testimony
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; that he pleased God because the Bible
[2:26:22] says without faith it's impossible to
[2:26:25] please him. That's right.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; So, this bride is going to have the
[2:26:34] faith, not your faith, God's faith.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; It's God's business. We hear from
[2:26:41] brother James, brother Steven, these
[2:26:43] brethren preaching to us about the
[2:26:45] father's business. This is it. This is
[2:26:48] it.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; I must be about my father's business.
[2:26:52] not done on his career, not being a
[2:26:54] painter or
[2:26:56] this and that. No, let me tell you,
[2:26:59] God's calling you out of this one little
[2:27:02] dimension into something far greater.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; And thank God that he sent a prophet.
[2:27:10] He looked beyond the curtain of time. He
[2:27:12] said, "I seen hundreds, thousands of
[2:27:15] them."
[2:27:18] He said, "These are yours. Are these all
[2:27:20] Brandoms? No. No. He said they're your
[2:27:24] converts.
[2:27:27] Listen,
[2:27:29] this bride is not going to be this bride
[2:27:31] out loud. You see, is not going to be
[2:27:33] just a handful.
[2:27:37] The table thousands of mine.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw them over there.
[2:27:46] I hugged her necks. Do you recognize
[2:27:48] this this beautiful young woman? Oh, my
[2:27:51] precious brother. He said, "You won her
[2:27:54] to Christ when she's 90 some odd years
[2:27:56] old."
[2:28:00] We are about ready to have the greatest
[2:28:04] youth convention this world has ever
[2:28:07] seen. I'm closer, Brother Dave Maple. I
[2:28:11] am closer to 20 than I've ever been.
[2:28:15] Amen.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; Closer to 18.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says, "If this body be
[2:28:20] dissolved,
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; I have another one."
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "When you are catching
[2:28:26] revelation, you're hearing from
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; your theophony."
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; What is it? The part of you that never
[2:28:34] fell.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; The part of you that God had in his
[2:28:37] mind.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you realize it's you
[2:28:40] encouraging you? DO YOU REALIZE IT'S GOD
[2:28:43] CALLING ONTO GOD? DO YOU REALIZE IT
[2:28:46] AIN'T YOU? IT'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU
[2:28:48] THAT'S QUICKENING AND PULLING YOU.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; I LOVE HIM THIS MORNING. DON'T YOU?
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; This is getting greater. HE SAID, "WATCH
[2:29:01] AFTER I'M GONE, YOU'LL BEGIN TO CATCH
[2:29:03] THESE THINGS."
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; OH, BACK THEN. PROPHET, PROPHET,
[2:29:07] PROPHET.
[2:29:10] The seasons changed.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Now to the prophet's message.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Do we take away from the prophet?
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; No. This is why he came.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Okay, I got to be
[2:29:31] careful because I start to want to
[2:29:32] preach the next couple sermons that I
[2:29:35] have.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love him. Don't you? Let's stand
[2:29:39] together this morning. If you love him,
[2:29:42] put your hands together. Give him a
[2:29:44] praise offering.
[2:29:49] Yeah. Amen. Amen. This message
[2:29:54] WAS FOR YOU. GOD came looking for you.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; You didn't go LOOKING FOR IT. GOD went
[2:30:00] looking for you. Because you are seen.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; You had the ability to be reborn.
[2:30:05] Because if you're nonse, YOU GOT no
[2:30:07] ability.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; All right. Let your word be born
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; in the manger.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; Word be born
[2:30:20] in the manger of my heart.
[2:30:25] Let it live.
[2:30:29] star
[2:30:33] live inside this house
[2:30:39] and hold it every day.
[2:30:44] Let your word be born
[2:30:48] in the manger
[2:30:50] of my heart. First verse
[2:30:57] was a tiny simple stable
[2:31:01] all
[2:31:04] in one.
[2:31:07] Are we amazed
[2:31:10] for a king to be born?
[2:31:14] He didn't choose some place special
[2:31:19] to reveal his fantasies.
[2:31:24] So when I found you in control
[2:31:34] your word
[2:31:39] in the manger of
[2:31:44] Oh
[2:31:52] come
[2:31:53] inside his house
[2:31:57] and holy air.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord
[2:32:06] in the manger
[2:32:09] of my
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; second verse. Outwardly I'm nothing.
[2:32:15] Our ability
[2:32:19] comes
[2:32:21] to behold
[2:32:24] likely
[2:32:28] for virtue untold. You got to yield the
[2:32:32] vessel.
[2:32:33] Just yield this vessel.
[2:32:36] Let him have his way from glory glory.
[2:32:44] He'll change you change me day by day.
[2:32:49] Let your word
[2:32:51] your word
[2:32:54] be more
[2:32:56] in a manger of my heart. Yes Lord. Yes
[2:33:01] Lord.
[2:33:04] Let the word therefore
[2:33:08] live inside
[2:33:10] his house and flame.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; Let your word be born
[2:33:22] in the manger.
[2:33:25] Let your word let it be born. Yes Lord,
[2:33:30] let your word
[2:33:33] be manifested
[2:33:37] on display.
[2:33:39] A reflection of you, Lord. Live in me.
[2:33:44] Let it
[2:33:48] all
[2:33:49] s
[2:34:00] Lord, yes, we believe, Lord, the manger.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me. Be it unto me.
[2:34:11] Be it unto me
[2:34:16] according to thy word,
[2:34:22] according to thyes.
[2:34:27] I can stand secure
[2:34:33] upon my heart. The truth
[2:34:38] that sets me free
[2:34:43] according to thy word.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Can you lift your arms and sing the song
[2:34:52] of Mary for yourself? Be it unto me.
[2:34:57] for according to thy word.
[2:35:03] according to thine proises.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; I can stand
[2:35:13] just by my heart.
[2:35:18] The truth that sets me free
[2:35:23] according to thy word. Oh
[2:35:31] to me.
[2:35:33] How do you explain?
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; How do you
[2:35:43] no length, no height, no depth, no
[2:35:46] another dimension.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; East to west.
[2:35:51] Amen. Right is deep and his wife.
[2:35:57] It's what we heard about today.
[2:36:00] You know all our
[2:36:06] and you know all our fear
[2:36:13] that words not express the love we feel
[2:36:19] but we look for you to hear. Listen to
[2:36:23] our heart today.
[2:36:26] Don't listen to my voice.
[2:36:32] Oh, hear us hearing.
[2:36:38] Song of praise and thanks. Praise that
[2:36:42] flows
[2:36:45] from those you have redeemed.
[2:36:53] And we will use the word we know
[2:36:57] should you what
[2:37:02] God
[2:37:06] words are not enough
[2:37:09] to tell you.
[2:37:17] Second verse. It emerges all I pray
[2:37:26] from these wins.
[2:37:32] And if I had a thousand years,
[2:37:38] Lord, I would still run out.
[2:37:46] If you listen to my heart.
[2:37:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:37:54] People will say,
[2:37:58] "Oh, thank you for life." Oh, thank you
[2:38:03] for the truth and I will thank you for
[2:38:07] the way.
[2:38:10] Listen to our heart.
[2:38:12] Listen to my heart.
[2:38:18] Oh, hear our spirit sing
[2:38:27] and blow
[2:38:31] from those you have brea
[2:38:38] And we are you
[2:38:41] know
[2:38:43] tell you what
[2:38:46] an awesome God you are but words are not
[2:38:53] enough.
[2:39:01] Words are not enough.
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; But words are not enough.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; You glad you been in the house of the
[2:39:18] Lord today?
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; We heard about dimensions.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; We have a box here that's got a length
[2:39:27] and a height and a depth.
[2:39:29] You cannot put God in a box
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; because he is higher. He's wider. He's
[2:39:34] taller. Whatever he's deeper, whatever
[2:39:37] your need is, he is so big. You can't
[2:39:40] confine him to one little box. God is
[2:39:43] big and he has everything in his
[2:39:46] control.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that I have eyes to see and a
[2:39:51] heart to believe. What you have need of,
[2:39:54] you can receive. You can receive. Do you
[2:39:56] love the Lord today? The Lord is good.
[2:39:58] Let us give him a praise offering with
[2:40:00] our hands.
[2:40:04] May the Lord bless brother Ron today.
[2:40:08] Bless you as we go this morning.
[2:40:10] Remember our service Wednesday night,
[2:40:12] 7:30 and the study series Friday night
[2:40:15] here at the church on the seventh church
[2:40:17] ages. Goodness of God as we go. I just
[2:40:20] want to tell them, Lord, thank you for
[2:40:22] your goodness to me.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; I'm no good, but you're all good. Thank
[2:40:27] you for sharing your goodness with me.
[2:40:31] Changing the old rotten man to a good
[2:40:33] man, a nature change. That's what God
[2:40:36] does this morning. Let's sing it. May it
[2:40:38] be on your lips today and throughout
[2:40:41] this week that my God is good. I love
[2:40:45] you, Lord.
[2:40:49] For your mercy never fails me.
[2:40:55] Oh, and all my days.
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; Here's the secret. I've been held in
[2:41:00] your hands.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; From the moment that I wake up
[2:41:08] until I lay my head,
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; I will sing.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; I will sing
[2:41:15] of the goodness
[2:41:18] of God.
[2:41:20] All my life. Yes, Lord.
[2:41:23] Oh, and all my love you have me.
[2:41:32] And all my life you have been so
[2:41:38] good.
[2:41:41] With every breath that I give,
[2:41:45] all that's within me, I lose
[2:41:50] all of the goodness
[2:41:52] of God.
[2:42:01] You have led me through the fire.
[2:42:06] In the darkest night,
[2:42:10] you are most like.
[2:42:15] Oh, I've known you as a father
[2:42:19] and I've known you as a friend. I can
[2:42:23] say that I have live
[2:42:27] in the goodness
[2:42:29] of God
[2:42:31] all my life.
[2:42:34] Oh, all my life you have been.
[2:42:44] All my life you have been so
[2:42:49] good.
[2:42:52] With every bre I
[2:42:58] will sing.
[2:43:05] Your goodness,
[2:43:09] your goodness is running after you is
[2:43:13] running out to me.
[2:43:17] Your goodness is running after
[2:43:21] running to me.
[2:43:25] my lay down. I surrender now. I give you
[2:43:31] everything.
[2:43:34] Your goodness is running out. Is running
[2:43:39] out. Your goodness.
[2:43:43] Your goodness is running out. It's
[2:43:47] running after me.
[2:43:52] Your goodness is running. and surrounded
[2:43:55] after surrounded me
[2:43:59] with my life down.
[2:44:04] I hear every day
[2:44:09] your
[2:44:14] dream. All my life. All my life.
[2:44:20] For all my life you have been faithful.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; I say thank you Lord.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; All my life you have been so so good.
[2:44:38] With every breath that I am able,
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; all that's within me, I will sing
[2:44:47] of the goodness
[2:44:50] of God.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; And I will sing
[2:44:55] in the morning, in the afternoon, in the
[2:44:57] evening
[2:44:59] of God. Yes, I'm going to sing.
[2:45:03] Oh, I will sing
[2:45:06] of the goodness.
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap of
[2:45:13] praise.
[2:45:17] Amen. There's a Jun Junior Youth meeting
[2:45:20] today. Remember that announcement for
[2:45:21] junior youth. You are in a junior youth
[2:45:24] saints. God bless you today. Take this
[2:45:27] goodness and let it live through you
[2:45:29] this day. God bless you. Have a
[2:45:31] wonderful day. Lord, we'll see you
