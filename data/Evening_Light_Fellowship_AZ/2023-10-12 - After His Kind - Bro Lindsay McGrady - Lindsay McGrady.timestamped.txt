[29:19] you know a year ago this time it was
[29:22] extremely difficult you know when we
[29:23] were looking at a a baby that medical
[29:27] staff didn't expect to survive didn't
[29:30] expect him to live and heart and
[29:32] hypertension from trying to pump blood
[29:35] into a lung that was undeveloped and you
[29:37] know a miracle of God that that
[29:40] developed a lung that put that lung in
[29:42] place that has and done so many
[29:44] wonderful things in Josiah's life and so
[29:46] we're we're so grateful we're very very
[29:48] thankful for all that the Lord and we
[29:50] know the Lord's still working he's not
[29:52] done right amen sometimes we we we fail
[29:55] to remember hey he's he's doing what he
[29:58] knows to do that is best right amen so
[30:01] we we appreciate that enjoy brother
[30:03] Ron's testimony I'd never heard it you
[30:05] know you don't really know somebody till
[30:06] you really get to hear their testimony
[30:08] so now I feel like I know brother Ron I
[30:10] knew that he had been a surfer and so
[30:12] forth and I'd always imagin long blonde
[30:15] hair I have a vivid
[30:19] imagination
[30:21] but but you know to hear the testimony
[30:23] it was it was tremendous it was a
[30:25] blessing so I appreciate that and I
[30:27] always appreciate the the presence of
[30:29] the Lord here at evening lot it's just
[30:31] it's a it's such a a joy to walk in and
[30:34] hear you Worship the Lord and feel the
[30:36] presence of the Lord like I said you
[30:37] can't you don't get that everywhere so
[30:40] but let's let's jump into the word of
[30:41] the Lord now we going here Genesis the
[30:44] first chapter and you may have
[30:46] recognized we read some different
[30:50] scripture we read seven different
[30:51] scriptures here and the word kind was
[30:54] used in scriptures and the word kind is
[30:56] used in the Old Testament 31 times and
[30:59] it's actually used 10 times in these
[31:01] seven verses that we read and it
[31:03] actually makes a statement here after
[31:07] his kind and that statement is also here
[31:11] 10 times in these seven verses after his
[31:14] is kind and I would like to take that
[31:16] for a title tonight if I may after his
[31:19] is kind that word kind in the Hebrew
[31:23] actually means species after this
[31:26] species that something is going to be
[31:28] made after a certain type or after a
[31:31] certain species and we know we read
[31:33] there in the the first couple of verses
[31:35] 11th 12th verses where God was dealing
[31:37] with a botney life and he was telling
[31:39] the herbs to bring forth the trees the
[31:41] fruits the things and he said whose seed
[31:44] is in itself now you recognize that when
[31:48] you read these passages he doesn't use
[31:50] that term whose seed is in itself other
[31:53] than when it's talking about the boty
[31:55] life and the prophet of God told us you
[31:56] know every Apple that's going to be in
[31:59] an apple tree it's it's in that it's in
[32:01] that seed it's in that apple or in that
[32:03] little sprig of a plant when it's just a
[32:06] few inches tall every Apple that's ever
[32:08] going to be there is in that tree at
[32:10] that point right so it seed is in itself
[32:14] amen you know that that tree doesn't
[32:16] have to mate with another tree to
[32:17] produce fruit so but he doesn't use that
[32:20] term uh when we get down here to when he
[32:22] starts talking about the living
[32:24] creatures when he starts talking about
[32:26] manimals and fish and so forth so it
[32:29] it's it's uh it's it's different but he
[32:31] uses the term after his kind and and
[32:36] this is a law of God's nature it's a law
[32:38] of nature that you know whenever you
[32:41] produce something whenever you plant
[32:42] something it is going to produce
[32:44] whatever you planted right that's that
[32:46] is it is the law of the spoken word
[32:48] whatever God spoke amen that's what it
[32:50] was going to produce I mean it was going
[32:52] to bring forth whatever the the word was
[32:54] I mean an Acron is always going to
[32:56] produce oak tree an acre will never
[32:59] produce an apple tree uh you know if you
[33:02] plant a pumpkin seed you're not going to
[33:04] get a watermelon it will never ever
[33:06] happen it's not going to produce a
[33:08] squash to me you know I can go down to
[33:10] the the farmers market and they've got
[33:12] all the fall pumpkins and squash and
[33:15] gourds and whatever else out and you
[33:17] know I can stand there and look at the
[33:19] green and the orange and the white and
[33:20] whatever and you know I really don't
[33:22] know the difference between a pumpkin
[33:24] and a squash so many of them look they
[33:27] look so similar you know but if you
[33:29] plant a pumpkin seed no matter how close
[33:31] it looks uh a squash may look like it
[33:34] you're always going to get a pumpkin
[33:36] right amen it's never going to transform
[33:38] that seed is not going to change Amen to
[33:41] produce something else I mean that's
[33:43] what you plant it that's what you're
[33:44] going to get so it's a law of nature
[33:47] it's going to happen I mean it's like
[33:49] gravity it's a law of nature right I
[33:52] mean I can stand up here and drop his
[33:53] handkerchief a thousand times gravity is
[33:56] always going to do the same thing it's a
[33:58] law right you don't break that law and
[34:00] so a law of nature that what it that
[34:03] that that thing is going to bring or
[34:05] produce after its kind now Jesus
[34:08] reaffirms this law and he applies it
[34:12] spiritually also we find out in Matthew
[34:15] the 7th chapter and the 16th verse it
[34:17] said ye shall know you shall know them
[34:20] by their fruits do men gather Grapes of
[34:23] thorns or figs of thistles you do not
[34:27] right you're going to get a grape you're
[34:28] going to a grape vine somewhere to get a
[34:30] grape right amen whatever many kinds of
[34:32] grapes you still going to have to come
[34:34] of grape vine it's not going to come
[34:35] from something else even so every good
[34:38] tree bringeth forth good fruit but a
[34:41] corrupt tree bringeth forth evil a good
[34:44] tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
[34:46] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[34:48] good fruit every tree that bringeth
[34:51] forth not gr food is heun down and cast
[34:53] into fire wherefore by their fruits ye
[34:55] shall know that
[34:57] because whatever the kind of tree that
[34:58] is it's going to produce that fruit I
[35:00] mean it's we know it is a law of nature
[35:03] right and it applies spiritually now
[35:06] Paul also confirms this over the book of
[35:09] Galatians 6th chapter and the 7th verse
[35:11] he says be not deceived God is not mal
[35:15] for whatsoever man sth that shall he
[35:18] also reap physically and spiritually
[35:21] naturally and spiritually amen whatever
[35:23] you s if you PL a garden amen you're
[35:26] going to going to reap whatever kind of
[35:28] seed that you have planted that's what's
[35:30] going to grow and whatever we whatever
[35:32] we're planting spiritually amen that's
[35:35] what we're also going to reap amen so
[35:38] it's a law of nature it doesn't change
[35:41] amen the prophet of God said in three
[35:43] kinds of Believers he said Nature has a
[35:47] law and there is a law of nature there
[35:49] is no way at all to get around it it is
[35:53] a law of Nature and the thing and then
[35:56] there is a law the spirit there is also
[35:58] no way of getting around that amen so
[36:01] here is a law of nature brother said you
[36:03] know you you can't change that God put
[36:05] in place this principle in the law of
[36:08] nature that whatever is planted that's
[36:11] what's going to grow that is what is
[36:13] going to be produced amen that's what is
[36:15] going to bring forth would you do it
[36:17] spiritually or you do it in a natural
[36:19] now we we stopped reading in Genesis the
[36:22] 1 chapter and the 26th verse or 25th
[36:26] verse but God was not finished with
[36:28] creation that's right in the 25th verse
[36:33] and he goes on into the 26th verse and
[36:35] God said let us make man in our image
[36:40] after our likeness and let them have
[36:44] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[36:46] over the foul of the air and over the
[36:47] cattle and over the Earth and everything
[36:49] that creeping the thing that creepeth
[36:51] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[36:54] own image in the image of God created he
[36:57] him male and female created he them and
[37:00] God blessed them and God said unto them
[37:02] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[37:05] the Earth and subdue it and have
[37:06] dominion over the fish of the of the Sea
[37:09] and the foul of the air and over
[37:11] everything that moveth upon the Earth so
[37:13] here is God now after he's made all
[37:15] these other things and he looked at all
[37:18] these other things he said you know what
[37:19] it's good and that tree is good that
[37:21] grass is good amen that that eagle is
[37:24] good that cowl is good uh all these
[37:26] things that creep on the earth they're
[37:28] good but you know they're not in my
[37:30] image and I really can't I really can't
[37:32] have fellowship with them amen so he
[37:34] took and he his final creation was in
[37:37] his own image he made Man In His Image
[37:40] after his likeness after his kind he
[37:43] made man so he could come down in the
[37:46] cold of the day and walk in the cold of
[37:48] the day and have fellowship with him and
[37:50] make could commune with him you know I
[37:52] know people love their dogs and you know
[37:54] your dog you can have a bad day amen you
[37:57] go in there that dog is waging his tail
[37:59] and and and his tongu hanging out no
[38:01] matter how bad a day you may have had
[38:03] amen no matter if you've lost your next
[38:05] of kid whatever that dog is always but
[38:07] listen he don't feel like you feel it
[38:09] doesn't understand what you what you're
[38:11] going through right but here God has
[38:14] created Something In His Image amen that
[38:17] that can that that can uh realize and
[38:19] feel what he feels can think like he
[38:22] thinks can speak the language that he
[38:24] speaks that has the to do the things
[38:28] amen that God could do amen hey that
[38:30] tree don't belong there let's move it
[38:31] over here that mountain don't belong
[38:33] there let's move it over this way amen
[38:35] he created man in His image
[38:38] amen so he can have that Fellowship now
[38:42] here's the thought if if man is created
[38:47] in the image of God and God tells man to
[38:50] go and be fruitful and multiply and
[38:53] replenish the
[38:55] Earth so what is the fruit of man going
[38:58] to
[39:00] produce if the law of God the law of
[39:03] nature is it's got to produce after its
[39:06] kind and God has created man in his own
[39:09] image now listen I can take that pumpkin
[39:12] amen I can plant that seed it grows it
[39:14] produces a nice pumpkin I can Harvest
[39:17] that pumpkin split it open take the
[39:19] seeds out of it dry the seeds next year
[39:21] plant the seed amen and guess what it's
[39:23] going to produce again another Pucket in
[39:25] the same image right amen every time I
[39:28] do that year after year now if you get
[39:29] some hybrid seed we know the hybrid seed
[39:31] it's good for one year it won't
[39:32] reproduce amen but if you go back to the
[39:34] original seed amen it's going to produce
[39:38] amen the same thing that it was and so
[39:40] if man is going to multiply be fruitful
[39:42] multiply replenish the Earth what is his
[39:44] fruit going to be should be in the image
[39:48] of God right it should be in the image
[39:51] of God now we
[39:54] know uh uh that there was a problem
[39:57] there and we we look over in Isaiah the
[40:01] 14th chapter and we find there Lucifer
[40:05] the son of the
[40:07] morning right the 12th verse Thou Art
[40:10] Fallen how are thou fallen from Heaven a
[40:12] loose for the sun of the morning how art
[40:14] thou cut down to the ground which which
[40:17] didst weaken the Nations for thou has
[40:20] said in thine heart I will Ascend into
[40:23] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[40:26] Stars of God and brother bam said Satan
[40:28] he and that was the sons of God right he
[40:30] said that's Sons the stars of God that's
[40:32] the sons he said I will sit upon the M
[40:34] of the congregation in the sides of the
[40:36] north I will Ascend above the heights of
[40:40] the clouds I will be like the most high
[40:45] and so here's Lucifer amen trying to say
[40:48] you know what I'm going to be like God I
[40:50] want to be like God it's my desire to be
[40:52] above the sons of God the stars of God
[40:55] and I'm going to bring my Throne up and
[40:57] I am going to be like the most high but
[40:59] God was not going to have any of that
[41:01] Lucifer was Satan was cast down because
[41:04] of his desire to exalt himself into the
[41:07] image or into the likeness of almighty
[41:09] God now you can imagine here it is Satan
[41:13] is rejected from projecting himself into
[41:16] the image of God and yet he looks and he
[41:18] sees that God has created
[41:21] man in his own image amen and so we know
[41:25] that Satan he corrupts that lineage he
[41:29] interjects he pollutes he corrupts and
[41:32] contaminates the seed of God so that now
[41:34] whenever whenever man goes to produce
[41:37] fruit he's not producing in the image of
[41:40] God are you with me come on don't leave
[41:44] and so we know we know the story Satan
[41:46] begals Eve and so forth and we find here
[41:49] then in Genesis the 3D chapter after
[41:53] that Satan had beguiled Eve uh uh and
[41:57] and uh corrupted that that bloodline it
[42:01] says in the 14th verse of Genesis the
[42:03] thir chapter that the Lord God said unto
[42:05] the serpent because thou has done this
[42:08] thou are cursed above all cattle and
[42:10] above every beast of the field and upon
[42:12] thy belly thou sh go and th Thou shalt
[42:14] eat all the days of life and I will put
[42:16] eny between thee and the woman and
[42:18] between thy seed and her seed and it
[42:21] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[42:23] bruise his heel now we know so the
[42:25] serpent had a seed
[42:27] it amazes me all the people that want to
[42:28] leave the truth today all of a sudden
[42:30] they don't believe that the serpent had
[42:32] a seed any longer they don't believe
[42:34] that truth anymore amen but the
[42:36] scripture tells us right here that
[42:37] there's going to be and we see the
[42:40] results of the seed of the serpent we
[42:43] look around you don't you walk outside
[42:45] the door and you'll see the results of
[42:47] the seed of the serpent you'll see what
[42:49] the seed of the serpent is producing you
[42:51] you you go to the internet and you find
[42:53] out that that what 40 babies were
[42:56] beheaded in
[42:58] Israel babies babies now what kind of
[43:01] human being could behead a
[43:05] baby that is the serpent seed that is
[43:08] what do that is what the serpent
[43:10] produced you look out here and you see
[43:13] sin you see the vile acts are going on
[43:15] you see people doing unconscious acts
[43:17] amen that that they that and don't lose
[43:19] a sleep over day America guilty of what
[43:23] uh I think it's 62 plus million uh uh uh
[43:28] abortions don't think a thing about it
[43:30] think that's all right it's our body
[43:31] we'll do what we want to with it and you
[43:33] know what that is it is showing the
[43:35] fruit of the serpent it is showing that
[43:38] that that that product of the serpent is
[43:42] still very much real and very much alive
[43:45] here in Satan's Eden in Satan's Eden
[43:48] that fruit is being produced amen and
[43:51] and and the ungodliness it's it's just
[43:53] beyond uh uh what we we our minds can
[43:56] imagine I cannot I cannot fathom that
[43:59] somebody could take a a a child and
[44:01] behead it a baby beheaded I I mean that
[44:06] that is the product that is the product
[44:08] of a serpent it's it's beyond just being
[44:10] an animal it's beyond being an animal
[44:12] see that an animal an animal acts better
[44:16] than that
[44:17] amen but but a human that a corrupt seed
[44:21] the corrupt bloodline of humanity that
[44:24] was corrupted by the seed of the serpent
[44:27] amen is producing in Satan's eating the
[44:30] most vile ungodly things you know you
[44:33] you
[44:34] you I don't know maybe I shouldn't get
[44:36] off on this I don't know but you know
[44:38] sometimes you walk out here down the
[44:40] street you go you you go shopping
[44:42] whatever you go to a restaurant and in
[44:44] walk someone you know got tattoos from
[44:47] their eyebrows down to their toenails
[44:49] you know they've got Pearsons everywhere
[44:51] going all kinds of places and and today
[44:54] they I mean they I I've seed them you
[44:56] know where they they split their tongue
[44:58] to look like a Serpent's Tongue it's a
[45:01] manifestation of the seed it's a
[45:02] manifestation of what is on the inside
[45:05] of them it's something that a spirit
[45:07] that's on the inside of them that is
[45:09] manifesting itself on the outside and we
[45:12] see that minut it is very real you don't
[45:14] have to go very far to see these things
[45:17] and and so it's just that manifestation
[45:19] of of what is taking place but now I
[45:22] want you to know something whenever
[45:23] Satan polluted into or interjected into
[45:27] the bloodline of humanity because here
[45:30] is the the the creature that was made in
[45:32] the image of almighty God and he
[45:34] pollutes that he didn't just pollute
[45:38] one we all become subject to that we all
[45:42] become guilty we all become a part of
[45:45] that Romans the 5th chapter 12th verse
[45:47] says wherefore as by one man cented in
[45:50] sin entered into the world and death by
[45:53] sin so death passed upon all men for
[45:55] that that all have sinned and so we all
[45:59] become subject to that right no matter
[46:02] what kind of a good home you may have
[46:03] been raised in amen you know nobody had
[46:06] to teach that child at 2 years old how
[46:08] to lie we were after church here oh
[46:12] guess it's been two or three weeks ago
[46:13] and and I ID come out after service and
[46:16] I was setting in the nursery and and my
[46:19] two and a half-year-old little
[46:21] granddaughter she runs in there and she
[46:23] says pop uh are we going to go out to
[46:26] eat I said well go ask Gali she took off
[46:31] running out the door and I heard her she
[46:32] running out that door and the top her L
[46:34] pop said
[46:39] yes
[46:42] whoa that's taking a lot of Liberty with
[46:44] what pop said and you know nobody had to
[46:47] teach her to say that I mean it just
[46:49] it's a part of it as much as I love her
[46:52] amen you know there's that if she gets
[46:54] in trouble she'll she'll come out with
[46:56] something to defend herself at 2 and 1/2
[46:58] years
[47:00] old I mean just we we were we were uh
[47:04] telling her to you know look you here a
[47:06] few months ago say if you'll quit you
[47:08] know wearing a diaper and to pull up and
[47:10] you'll use the potty we'll have a we'll
[47:12] have a potty
[47:15] party hey try it sometime it works okay
[47:18] so we not the potty the
[47:23] party so we told her okay you know and
[47:27] you'll go a week or whatever it was and

[47:33] party we'll get every everybody to come
[47:34] and we'll cook out and do all this stuff
[47:36] so she was getting really close and she
[47:38] was outside playing and all of a sudden
[47:40] she had an
[47:42] accident she got up on the she got up on
[47:44] the front porch and there's some water
[47:46] there and she started pouring that water
[47:47] out and I said what is she doing you
[47:48] that's Sharon had it to to water the
[47:51] flowers with and she's ped and she
[47:53] started stomping around in that water
[47:56] and like you know I I'll go tell them I
[47:58] I didn't wet myself I I stomped in the
[48:02] Water 2 and 1/2 years
[48:05] old nobody taught her that you know we I
[48:09] I we telling hey you don't lie you tell
[48:11] the truth that's but look at that's a
[48:13] part amen they're born with that nature
[48:15] right we were all in that place at one
[48:18] time we come forth amen from our
[48:20] mother's womb speaking lies amen we
[48:22] formed in that shaped in that amen We
[48:24] inherited that from the fall am mean
[48:27] that's what the position that we were
[48:28] put in so death passed upon all men in
[48:32] that all have sinned righten so we've
[48:34] all been in that place now I I want to
[48:38] look amen over here to go let's flip
[48:39] over to John the 8th
[48:41] chapter uh real quickly John 8th chapter
[48:44] the 31st verse then Jesus said to those
[48:48] Jews which believed on him so I would
[48:51] just I want to I want to take us to that
[48:54] verse because I want you to know who who
[48:55] he's speaking
[48:56] to he's speaking to Jews that believed
[49:01] on
[49:03] him
[49:05] if you continue in my
[49:08] word then are you my disciples indeed so
[49:12] it's not the fact that you've been
[49:13] following me that you say that you
[49:14] believe in me you got to continue in the
[49:16] word amen if you leave the word amen
[49:20] then amen and and this is a group so
[49:22] we're going to drop down here just see
[49:24] what he begins to tell the Jews that
[49:27] believed on him Amen in the 37th verse
[49:30] says I know that ye are Abraham's
[49:34] seed which is the natural seed in the
[49:37] natural yes you can do the DNA you can
[49:40] go back and you can look up your lead
[49:42] you can go take it all the way back to
[49:44] Abraham you can do it amen so in a
[49:46] natural yes I know that you are
[49:48] Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me
[49:50] because my
[49:52] word have no place in you it's not there
[49:56] my word is not but if you'll continue in
[49:58] my word then you are my disciples indeed
[50:01] and you shall know the truth and the
[50:02] truth shall make you free right amen so
[50:04] if you continue in the word amen then
[50:07] you're going to know the truth amen but
[50:10] my word doesn't have any place in you
[50:12] the 38th verse I speak that which I have
[50:14] seen with my father and ye do that which
[50:17] you have seen with your father so here
[50:21] he is talking about a lineage Who Who
[50:23] Are You amen who do you Bel and they
[50:25] answered and said unto him Abraham is
[50:27] our father Jesus said unto him if you
[50:30] were Abraham's children you would do the
[50:32] works of Abraham and so now you know one
[50:35] he says I know that you're Abraham's
[50:37] children you are
[50:39] naturally yes you are amen you're that's
[50:42] that's who that's who your father is in
[50:45] a natural but there's another father
[50:47] there there's somebody else amen that is
[50:50] Father the spirit that is in
[50:53] you and he says in the 4 41st verse he
[50:56] says ye do the Deeds of your father then
[51:00] they say to him we be not a fornication
[51:02] we have one father even God so now they
[51:05] bring it to the spiritual we have you
[51:06] know it's not Abraham's Our Father our
[51:08] spiritually speaking God is our father
[51:10] so the the convert the conversation here
[51:12] has been that you know yeah in the
[51:14] natural you're Abraham's seed but in the
[51:16] spiritual you're not you're not and you
[51:19] know the scripture says uh they're not
[51:22] all Israel that are of Israel that's
[51:24] right right
[51:26] now let me let me give you just a little
[51:28] help on that they're not all Israel that
[51:30] are of Jacob you know Jacob is Israel so
[51:33] the all the lineage that is of Jacob is
[51:35] not all Israel they're not all Israel so
[51:38] so you do the Deeds of your father and
[51:40] mean you because you you bear the image
[51:42] of your father now you know I the older
[51:45] I get the more they say that I look like
[51:47] my dad I I've sounded like him for a few
[51:51] years every once in a while something
[51:53] would come out of my mouth and I say I
[51:54] didn't say that my dad said that that
[51:57] wasn't me but now the problem is is I I
[52:00] lost my dad uh back in 2019 I'd love to
[52:04] spend a day with him whatever but you
[52:05] know I'd love to see him but I'm getting
[52:07] tired of seeing him in the mirror
[52:09] because that's where I go I see all yeah
[52:12] we were sitting in in the living room
[52:13] one day and all a sudden Sharon go just
[52:15] like that I'm like what you know I
[52:17] thought oh no there's another snake in
[52:18] the house or
[52:19] something she said I looked over there
[52:22] and you look just like your dad sitting
[52:23] in that chair
[52:26] not exactly what I wanted not day here
[52:29] right but you begin you know you take on
[52:31] that image you know I I didn't do it I
[52:34] didn't ask hey can I look like Richard
[52:36] McGrady can can can I sound like him can
[52:38] I act like him but you know there's
[52:40] those traits those characteristics in
[52:42] the natural the seed in the natural is
[52:44] beginning to manifest itself more and
[52:48] more and more amen but God help us that
[52:50] the seed in the spiritual amen should be
[52:54] manifesting more and more and more right
[52:56] amen that we're bearing the image of our
[52:58] father amen so you do the works of your
[53:01] father Amen in the spirit or whatever
[53:03] that is you're going to produce whoever
[53:06] is your father you're going to produce
[53:08] the works of that amen that's what
[53:09] you're going to do in a 44th verse of
[53:11] John the 8 chapter says ye are of your
[53:16] father hey let's just cut to the chase
[53:20] let's just get right down to the Brass
[53:22] taxes here you of your father the devil
[53:24] and the lust of your father will you do
[53:25] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[53:28] Abode not in the truth because there was
[53:30] no truth in him amen the truth did not
[53:34] reside there was nothing there he had a
[53:36] desire to be like God he wanted to exalt
[53:39] himself into that image or that position
[53:41] that place amen and yet because he
[53:44] couldn't he didn't want anybody else to
[53:46] be able to get into that position either
[53:48] amen so he was a murder from the
[53:49] beginning there was no truth in him when
[53:51] he speak of a lie he speak of his own he
[53:53] is a liar and the father father of it
[53:56] amen and he wants to he wants to to lie
[53:59] to you and tell you these things so we
[54:01] see this amen now first John the 3
[54:04] chapter and the eth verse says he that
[54:07] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[54:10] devil sinth from the beginning for this
[54:13] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[54:15] that he might destroy the works of the
[54:17] devil so Satan's works are being
[54:21] manifested all around us amen and unfort
[54:25] some of us am me can dig back and
[54:27] recessive our memory and we can we can
[54:29] recall when we were doing some of those
[54:32] works yeah I heard C I'm not mentioned
[54:34] any names but I heard a certain man say
[54:36] something about smoking some good pot or
[54:38] something like that I don't not mention
[54:41] in any any names but we can every one of
[54:44] us most every one of us can can dig back
[54:48] some of us a lot worse than others a lot
[54:50] of things that we did maybe a lot worse
[54:52] than what some of others that was raised
[54:55] in the message you know thank God I hope
[54:57] I hope maybe you said yeah I remember
[54:59] that time I I told that lie that we was
[55:01] going out to eat or whatever when I was

[55:11] could find in Ash County North Carolina
[55:13] to do all 20,000 people if there was
[55:16] problems I was looking for it because
[55:19] there was something that was pulling me
[55:20] to that right I mean I was raised a
[55:22] Methodist I was looking to get in every
[55:24] bit of trouble I could
[55:25] find and I found some and then I created
[55:28] some okay
[55:31] so oh the stories I could tell you but
[55:35] we're not going to I'm not going down
[55:37] what is it a rabbit hole is that what it
[55:38] was we're not going down that rabbit
[55:39] hole tonight we got to get out of here I
[55:41] think he just charged this microphone up
[55:43] for 45 minutes so I got to
[55:45] hurry so you know in in this 1 John
[55:48] third chapter verse he that committed
[55:50] sin is all the devil for the devil sinth
[55:52] from the beginning for this purpose of
[55:54] the son of God manifest he might destroy
[55:56] the works of the devil hey I'm glad that
[55:59] he come my way to destroy the works of
[56:03] the devil that was being produced in my
[56:05] life amen because they were there I'm
[56:07] not going to I'm going to tell you well
[56:09] you know what I was always good I always
[56:10] believed and all these I
[56:12] didn't but he destroyed those Works amen
[56:15] of the devil amen and you know what we
[56:17] the Bible tells we've all seen to come
[56:19] short of the glory of God so don't tell
[56:21] me how pretty your Halo is and how
[56:24] brother answer how good you are amen
[56:26] we've all sin come short we've all was
[56:28] put into that category it said the verse
[56:31] n says who soever is born of God does
[56:35] not commit sin what is sin unbel
[56:39] unbelief amen whoever is born of
[56:42] God I'm going to tell you something when
[56:44] that doctor smacked your behind you were
[56:46] not born of God you were born of
[56:51] Mama oh y'all got quiet on me right
[56:53] there for his
[56:56] seed remaineth in him and he cannot see
[56:58] because he is born of God right amen so
[57:02] thank God there is something that you
[57:03] were born in the 10th verse of 1 John
[57:05] the 3rd Chapter in this the children of
[57:07] God are manifested and the children of
[57:09] the devil so we see amen these these two
[57:12] groups here whosoever do not righteous
[57:14] is not of God neither he that do that
[57:17] that loveth not his brother for this is
[57:20] the message you have heard from the
[57:21] beginning that you should love one
[57:23] another that is going to be the that is
[57:25] going to be the fruit of a Believer by
[57:28] this shall all men know that you are my
[57:29] disciples because you have loved one to
[57:32] another amen amen you can quote all the
[57:34] quotes you want to amen you can carry
[57:36] your Bible or a message book just like
[57:38] the prophet of God did all you want to
[57:40] amen but absent of having the love the
[57:43] fruit of love amen in our life amen you
[57:46] know that is that is what tells us amen
[57:49] that that we are the children of God
[57:51] Amen look a lot of times it's hard to
[57:53] love somebody else that's not my message
[57:56] tonight let me get back to my thought
[57:58] here that the children of God are
[58:00] manifested amen the children of the
[58:01] devil for this is the message that you
[58:04] have heard from the beginning that you
[58:05] that we should love one another and
[58:09] guess what it doesn't mean I love you
[58:11] because you don't have any faults that's
[58:13] right it doesn't mean that you love me
[58:15] because I don't have I've got plenty of
[58:17] faults just ask that Lolli back there
[58:20] she'll tell you some of them and then
[58:23] you if you she don't give you enough go
[58:24] to her son and in my daughter-in-law
[58:26] they'll tell you I have plenty of faults
[58:28] so it's not that we love one another
[58:29] because we don't have faults that's not
[58:31] it right amen not as Cain who was of
[58:35] that Wicked one and slew his brother and
[58:38] wherefore slew he because his own Works
[58:41] were evil and his brothers righteous so
[58:43] we see amen that the the difference that
[58:46] come down here and people want to deny
[58:47] serpy I said well wait a minute let me
[58:49] ask you a question why did they when
[58:51] they committed sin in the garden why did
[58:53] they notice that and they make apron
[58:55] you know looks like they would have got
[58:57] into the to the coid
[59:01] mask don't e an
[59:04] apple no they made aprons why was it the
[59:07] sign of circumcision why was it a virgin
[59:09] birth hey but why were all these things
[59:11] me because it all goes back to the
[59:12] original sin right that polluted mankind
[59:16] that God's promised Abrahams guess what
[59:18] Abraham that's how the problem come amen
[59:20] but that's not how I'm going to solve it
[59:24] it's going to be a virgin birth it's not
[59:26] going to be bisexual Act Right amen so
[59:28] we see these things now so we find out
[59:31] amen that we all amen come forth amen
[59:34] speaking lies we all had our problems we
[59:36] all had the wrong attributes amen that's
[59:39] why Jesus told us in John the third
[59:41] chapter that you must he said Marvel not
[59:43] that I say unto you that you must be
[59:45] born again that you must be born again
[59:49] amen not that it's a good suggestion
[59:50] it's an idea but you must be born again
[59:53] he said in the fifth verse Jesus said
[59:55] ver I say you unto the except a man be
[59:58] born of water and the spirit he cannot
[59:59] enter into the kingdom of God Amen so a
[1:00:02] new birth is still necessary now you
[1:00:05] know I've been preaching on the seat
[1:00:06] here and I want to put this little
[1:00:08] caveat in here or disclaimer in here
[1:00:11] because a lot of times we get to
[1:00:12] preaching on seed and and and you know
[1:00:15] what we some somewhere along the way we
[1:00:17] lose the
[1:00:18] birth we lose the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:21] Ghost in that well you know I was born
[1:00:22] to seated and so and then we do damage
[1:00:25] to people I know you know as a young
[1:00:27] person as as an 18yearold when I first
[1:00:29] come in and began to serve the Lord and
[1:00:31] heard the truth and and and was making
[1:00:33] that every time that I would mess up the
[1:00:34] devil would come around to me and say
[1:00:36] well you're not
[1:00:38] seed you didn't really get the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost that was just uh you know that was
[1:00:42] just emotion you know he began to be
[1:00:45] brother Ezra he beat me over the head
[1:00:46] that beat me over the head with that so
[1:00:48] you know I try not to do that to other
[1:00:49] people I don't want some young people
[1:00:51] say say well you know what I made a
[1:00:52] mistake I I I I I I I laughed at a joke
[1:00:55] I shouldn't laughed at or or this or
[1:00:57] that or whatever and and you the devil
[1:00:59] starts saying H you're not you might as
[1:01:00] well give up you might as well CRI
[1:01:01] because you're not seed the devil uses
[1:01:04] that so we need to be careful with that
[1:01:06] and we need to be careful that by
[1:01:08] talking about a seed that we never get
[1:01:10] away from a birth CU Jesus said Marvel
[1:01:13] not that I said to you you must be born
[1:01:16] again except you're born to the water of
[1:01:18] the spirit you cannot enter in to that
[1:01:20] into that spiritual realm you cannot
[1:01:22] enter into that Kingdom you cannot enter
[1:01:24] in to that place Amen in the spiritual
[1:01:26] realm you cannot do it except there be a
[1:01:29] birth and so we see the birth makes the
[1:01:33] difference Romans the 8th chapter the
[1:01:37] nth verse be not in the flesh but in the
[1:01:40] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:01:42] dwell in you now if he a man have not
[1:01:45] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[1:01:48] the 11th verse but if the spirit of him
[1:01:50] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:01:52] in you he that raised up Jesus Jesus
[1:01:54] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:01:56] mortal bodies by the spirit of him that
[1:01:57] dwelleth in you so what is that Spirit
[1:01:59] dwelling in you amen where did that
[1:02:02] Spirit come from when did you have that
[1:02:04] experience with almighty God when did
[1:02:07] you come and receive that that made a
[1:02:09] change in you that changed your nature
[1:02:12] from someone that would do preserve
[1:02:15] Yourself by telling a lie or doing
[1:02:17] whatever amen where did that change
[1:02:20] where did that nature change take place
[1:02:23] in you
[1:02:24] now I can go back even as a little boy
[1:02:26] whenever I like I said I was doing every
[1:02:28] right thing that I could get my hands on
[1:02:30] to do but I could always go back and say
[1:02:32] you know God was dealing with me even
[1:02:34] then and I'm so glad for that I thankful
[1:02:36] that you should be thankful for that but
[1:02:39] I still had to come to a place that
[1:02:41] there was a a a birth that took place
[1:02:43] there was a change took place in my life
[1:02:47] amen so the 13th verse of Romans 8
[1:02:50] chapter says for if you live out the
[1:02:52] flesh you shall die but if you through
[1:02:53] the spirit do more mortify the Deeds of
[1:02:55] the body ye shall live amen it takes his
[1:02:58] spirit amen to mortify the Deeds of the
[1:03:03] corrupt flesh
[1:03:05] amen
[1:03:07] right you don't think the flesh is
[1:03:10] corrupt go look in the
[1:03:13] mirror hey a few years ago I didn't have
[1:03:16] this this silver stuff gray silver
[1:03:19] whatever you want to call it it was all
[1:03:21] nice dark didn't have those things but
[1:03:24] it's there righten so I see the effects
[1:03:26] of the corrupt flesh right amen but the
[1:03:30] spirit amen gives us the ability to
[1:03:33] mortify those actions those deeds those
[1:03:36] desires those things of the flesh the
[1:03:38] 14th verse for as many as are L by the
[1:03:40] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:03:42] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:03:44] bondage again into fear but you have
[1:03:45] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:03:47] we
[1:03:48] cry because of his spirit amen we can
[1:03:52] cry ABA father that's my father amen I
[1:03:55] have a new father praise the Lord the
[1:03:57] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:03:59] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:04:01] and if children than ARS of God and join
[1:04:03] ours with Christ if so be that we suffer
[1:04:06] with him that we may also be glorified
[1:04:08] together for I reckon that the
[1:04:09] sufferings of this present
[1:04:11] time any
[1:04:14] sufferings sure we all have sufferings
[1:04:16] right but the sufferings of this present
[1:04:18] time are not worthy to be compared with
[1:04:20] the glory that shall which shall be
[1:04:23] revealed in US amen so yeah you might be
[1:04:26] going through some things but it's going
[1:04:28] to produce something in you it's going
[1:04:30] to begin to bring out the character amen
[1:04:33] of that Spirit on the inside of you amen
[1:04:36] it begins to change amen it begins to
[1:04:38] break away the things of the flesh the
[1:04:40] desires of the flesh the the battles of
[1:04:42] the flesh amen some of these things you
[1:04:44] don't just you know hey well I Reed the
[1:04:46] baptism of Holy Ghost and and I'm a a
[1:04:48] full grown mature Christian now no you
[1:04:51] still struggle you still have battles
[1:04:54] you still have trials because there's a
[1:04:56] maturing process that is going on that
[1:04:59] is that is created remember amen that
[1:05:02] that
[1:05:03] character it is it is not a gift it's a
[1:05:06] victory right amen so you're fighting
[1:05:08] amen you're going through these battles
[1:05:11] and these struggles and it begins to
[1:05:12] produce a character in you and it's not
[1:05:14] your character amen amen it's a
[1:05:17] character of the father that begins to
[1:05:19] be manifested in you amen it's something
[1:05:22] that's begin to change in you now listen
[1:05:26] you know I know that my I've got a long
[1:05:28] ways to go I'm just going to be honest
[1:05:30] with you I've got a lot of things that I
[1:05:31] still need to overcome that I I still
[1:05:33] need to get victory over uh and so forth
[1:05:36] but thank God as as the old sister said
[1:05:39] I'm not what I used to be amen I ain't
[1:05:41] what I want to be but thank God I ain't
[1:05:43] what I used to be amen because there's
[1:05:45] that transition there amen you're going
[1:05:48] through that you're changing amen you're
[1:05:50] changing by his spirit amen as it says I
[1:05:54] think it's 2 Corinthians the 3rd Chapter
[1:05:56] and the 18th verse you're changing into
[1:05:58] that image amen by his Spirit praise the
[1:06:00] Lord amen so that's the work that is
[1:06:02] being done on the inside of us now amen
[1:06:06] John the 12th
[1:06:09] chapter and the 24th verse says verily
[1:06:11] verily I say unto you except a court of
[1:06:14] wheat fall to the ground and die it
[1:06:16] abideth alone but if it
[1:06:20] die it bringeth forth much fruit
[1:06:25] amen and we know this is talking about
[1:06:26] Jesus Christ and Jesus is saying it's
[1:06:29] about himself talking about the death
[1:06:31] that he was going to die and that with
[1:06:34] his death was going to produce more of
[1:06:36] the same thing it's going to bring forth
[1:06:39] much fruit now it's going to produce
[1:06:42] more of its kind when H this death is
[1:06:46] going to produce more of this kind now
[1:06:48] you know you have to imagine how bad
[1:06:50] Satan hates this because he corrupted
[1:06:55] the original created Son of God he
[1:06:59] crucified the spoken word or the begot
[1:07:04] only begotten Son of God he defiled the
[1:07:07] whole of humanity and yet on the day of
[1:07:11] Pentecost there was 120 more of
[1:07:14] them so here he is you know he's got to
[1:07:17] think hey this is my victory i' I've
[1:07:18] nailed Christ to the
[1:07:21] cross and yet there's 120 more and
[1:07:25] before the day was
[1:07:28] over there was 3,000 more so what is
[1:07:31] that got to be I mean here's the one the
[1:07:33] architect of trying to corrupt Humanity
[1:07:37] so that Humanity cannot be in the image
[1:07:39] of God and what he destroys the only
[1:07:42] begotten Son of God the next thing he
[1:07:44] knows here's 120 more of them that are
[1:07:48] of the same spirit in the same image in
[1:07:51] the same likeness as Jesus Christ was in
[1:07:54] doing the same works that Jesus did and
[1:07:57] greater than these that shall they do
[1:08:00] amen they're doing the same thing so
[1:08:01] Satan had to hate that it had to be like
[1:08:03] a literal nightmare to say wait a minute
[1:08:06] I got rid of Jesus I corrupted all the
[1:08:09] rest and now there's 120 of them and
[1:08:11] before the sun went down there was 3,000
[1:08:14] more on top of that hallelujah thank God
[1:08:17] you see what the baptism of the spirit
[1:08:19] of God does in your life it changes who
[1:08:22] you are if you've ever been filled with
[1:08:24] the spirit of God you know amen you
[1:08:26] can't deny it amen it did something in
[1:08:29] you amen it changed you praise God it
[1:08:32] made a difference on the inside amen so
[1:08:37] listen we know the greatness of
[1:08:41] God I take no glory on
[1:08:44] myself uh none at all me because I
[1:08:47] realize it's all him it's all Jesus
[1:08:49] Christ it's all
[1:08:51] God and so Satan took
[1:08:54] the image that God had created in his
[1:08:56] likeness and he defiled that so that was
[1:08:59] it was
[1:09:00] unrecognizable and God took those broken
[1:09:03] pieces of broken humanity and he began
[1:09:07] to call this one he began to call that
[1:09:09] one and he began to deal with that one
[1:09:10] amen he began to reach out to that when
[1:09:12] he took that broken life amen and when
[1:09:15] he put it back together it was greater
[1:09:17] than it was ever before and that's God I
[1:09:19] mean God was the one that was able to
[1:09:20] say you know what I'm going to take
[1:09:21] something that is so broken amen you
[1:09:24] know what would I be if I pulled out
[1:09:26] here in in a parking lot and a a a brand

[1:12:00] 1964
[1:12:02] Mustang that had been out sitting at a
[1:12:04] barn somewhere and it was all rusted and
[1:12:07] the motor wouldn't start and I said you
[1:12:09] know what I took
[1:12:11] that I took the engine out of that I
[1:12:15] redid the engine I rebuilt the
[1:12:16] transmission I took it down to the frame
[1:12:19] I scraped it all up I sanded it down I
[1:12:22] painted it I did all that well that's
[1:12:24] what God he did more than that when he
[1:12:26] took broken person like me when he took
[1:12:29] a broken life like me he didn't just say
[1:12:31] hey well here's somebody that was
[1:12:32] perfect here was somebody that was good
[1:12:34] here was somebody that was was righteous
[1:12:36] no he he let the he let the devil take
[1:12:39] us down to the bottom and he said Satan
[1:12:41] stand back and let me show you what I
[1:12:44] can do and he took that broken life amen
[1:12:47] sometimes you may think your life is so
[1:12:49] broken that it's hopeless that is
[1:12:51] exactly what God is looking for is a
[1:12:53] life that has broken that he may take
[1:12:55] hold of it and put it back together and
[1:12:58] say he didn't do that I did that amen
[1:13:01] the devil you did your worst but look
[1:13:04] what I did amen look what I took from
[1:13:07] your worst amen and made out of it I
[1:13:10] made something back in my image again I
[1:13:13] took something so corrupt amen something
[1:13:16] that was unrecognizable and I brought it
[1:13:18] back into my image into my image praise
[1:13:22] God that's what God does to us amen not
[1:13:25] because we were good or we was righteous
[1:13:26] or there was some Merit in us that
[1:13:29] deserved it amen or some favor in US
[1:13:31] amen it was all
[1:13:33] God so don't you ever think maybe your
[1:13:36] life is too
[1:13:38] broken God loves to take a broken life
[1:13:41] and show what he can do that nobody else
[1:13:44] can do it brother Ron cannot do that I
[1:13:46] cannot do that nobody can do that amen
[1:13:49] but God God does that
[1:13:52] right say he takes that corrupt and he
[1:13:54] makes it he produces it back and he said
[1:13:57] that seed that went into the ground said
[1:13:59] it's going to produce more fruit it's
[1:14:00] going to produce exactly what went into
[1:14:02] the ground that's right so what does the
[1:14:05] seed that went into the ground
[1:14:08] produce John the first
[1:14:11] chapter the first verse in the
[1:14:15] beginning was the
[1:14:18] word that's what was in the beginning
[1:14:20] I'm going to create man in my image
[1:14:24] in my likeness are we going to create
[1:14:26] man into that image so when that seed
[1:14:29] was produced amen we know that the the
[1:14:31] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:14:32] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:14:35] the Word was made flesh in Jesus Christ
[1:14:38] right and so now he said okay here the
[1:14:41] the word that was made flesh is going to
[1:14:44] die and go into the ground it may
[1:14:45] produce more fruit the very same thing
[1:14:48] the law of God says it can't produce
[1:14:50] something different amen the word that
[1:14:52] went into the ground is going to produce
[1:14:54] word right and it's going to be produced
[1:14:57] in Us Praise the Lord it's going to
[1:14:58] bring us into the image of almighty God
[1:15:01] into the image of the word Romans 8th
[1:15:03] chapter the 29th verse for whom he did
[1:15:06] for
[1:15:09] know he also did
[1:15:12] predestinate
[1:15:17] period I don't see a period actor
[1:15:21] predestinate for whom he did for no he
[1:15:23] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:15:28] the
[1:15:29] image of his son that is the word amen
[1:15:33] to be conformed to the image he didn't
[1:15:34] say hey I predestinate you I
[1:15:36] predestinate you I have pre-ordained for
[1:15:39] you to be into the image of my son into
[1:15:42] the image of the word that's what he's
[1:15:44] producing in us he's bringing us after
[1:15:46] his TI Into His Image not the image of a
[1:15:50] man not the image of society not not the
[1:15:53] image of religious people but into the
[1:15:55] image of almighty God into the image of
[1:15:57] the spoken word into the image of the
[1:15:59] Original Seed amen he is bringing us
[1:16:02] back to that
[1:16:04] amen Jehovah Gyra the second message
[1:16:08] brother Bram says and where can you put
[1:16:10] your faith on anything else but the word
[1:16:12] if God said it hold your finger to it
[1:16:14] that's true it doesn't shift it draws
[1:16:17] from the God's breasted book The Bible
[1:16:20] his attributes what he promised what he
[1:16:22] promised
[1:16:23] amen that's his word the word produces
[1:16:27] itself amen when it becomes in you amen
[1:16:30] when the life of God comes in you it
[1:16:33] produces the word it does not produce
[1:16:35] arrogancy it does not produce amen you
[1:16:38] know one thing I never met brother B I
[1:16:40] was I was less than two years old when
[1:16:42] he was taking off the scene but one
[1:16:43] thing I've heard brother Ron was the
[1:16:45] people that met him was talking about
[1:16:46] how the humility that when he walked on
[1:16:48] the
[1:16:49] platform people said you know we be S I
[1:16:51] would just be weeping and he walked
[1:16:53] walked on the platform around was like
[1:16:54] why am I weeping why am I weeping and
[1:16:56] they look around and everybody was
[1:16:57] weeping just because that humility is
[1:17:01] that the image is being produced again
[1:17:03] or is it producing arrogancy it don't if
[1:17:06] it's the word if it's the spirit of God
[1:17:07] if it's the word of God it's not good if
[1:17:08] it's the life of God is not going to
[1:17:10] produce something different right it's
[1:17:12] going to produce amen that same thing
[1:17:14] the word produces itself it's going to
[1:17:17] do that in your life right it's not you
[1:17:21] it's not you doing it it's him doing it
[1:17:23] amen praise the Lord amen in the message
[1:17:25] why little Bethlehem brother B says I
[1:17:27] mean a genuine holy baptism that
[1:17:30] produces the life of Jesus Christ back
[1:17:33] into the person the life amen coming
[1:17:37] back the life of God in you you weren't
[1:17:40] born with that you were born again with
[1:17:43] that right that was a new birth amen
[1:17:46] praise the Lord you didn't just join a
[1:17:47] church and say well hey you know what
[1:17:48] all of a sudden I think I'm going to go
[1:17:50] to evening Light Fellowship and and and
[1:17:52] and no amen you're born into the kingdom
[1:17:55] of God you're born into the family of
[1:17:57] God Amen then the Holy Spirit baptism
[1:17:59] produces a life of Jesus Christ what
[1:18:01] does it produce it produces the life of
[1:18:04] Jesus Christ back amen into the
[1:18:07] person amen I don't want to be like
[1:18:10] chrisan McGrady I want to be like Jesus
[1:18:12] Christ I want to be like that's the
[1:18:14] image that I want to manifest is who he
[1:18:16] is Amen in the message God's power to
[1:18:18] transform brother R says God through a
[1:18:21] seed of his word and there is only one
[1:18:24] thing that can Quicken the word and that
[1:18:27] is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to
[1:18:30] the word and when the life that is in
[1:18:32] the word meets the life in the spirit it
[1:18:35] produces whatever the seed is amen so it
[1:18:39] takes the spirit of God you can know the
[1:18:41] quotes you can know the Bible but until
[1:18:44] the spirit of God comes in and meets the
[1:18:46] word and anoints the word amen and
[1:18:48] brings the word to life it is nothing
[1:18:50] but a dead letter right but when the SP
[1:18:53] of God comes in you it takes the word
[1:18:55] that is done on his and it begins to
[1:18:57] produce something that is greater amen
[1:18:59] than you something greater than Humanity
[1:19:01] something greater than religious acts
[1:19:04] can do something M greater than what
[1:19:06] going to church can do amen I used to
[1:19:09] think well hey if I could go get me a
[1:19:12] cabin somewhere in the Yukon or maybe up
[1:19:14] in a Rocky Mountains of Montana
[1:19:16] somewhere back off the beig path man I
[1:19:18] could live this
[1:19:20] thing anybody else ever felt like gu
[1:19:24] yeah man if I just get away from from
[1:19:26] people people are the
[1:19:30] problem I could be a good pastor if it
[1:19:32] wasn't for the
[1:19:36] people the people are the problem but I
[1:19:39] did you know that's my mentality if I
[1:19:40] can just get away from everything oh I
[1:19:41] could live this thing but I want to tell
[1:19:43] you something with the baptism of the
[1:19:45] Holy Ghost the spirit of God moving on
[1:19:46] inside of a Believer amen you can put
[1:19:49] that person in the most wicked place on
[1:19:50] the earth and it'll live the life of Jes
[1:19:52] Jesus Christ that's what he'll do praise
[1:19:55] God because it ain't you if it's me
[1:19:57] doing it yeah I got to get back
[1:19:58] somewhere where there ain't nobody else
[1:20:01] and I still couldn't do it I still
[1:20:02] couldn't do it but because it's not me
[1:20:05] it's not you see you know what people
[1:20:07] get Christians Believers get frustrated
[1:20:10] because you know they try to live for
[1:20:11] the Lord try to serve the Lord they try
[1:20:13] to do it in himself he never intended
[1:20:15] for you to do this in yourself he never
[1:20:17] tried he never intended for you to live
[1:20:18] this by your own ability or your own
[1:20:20] power if you could do it then the Jews
[1:20:23] could have done it under the law they
[1:20:24] couldn't do it and so you can't do it
[1:20:26] amen it takes him to do it it takes him
[1:20:29] to do that Amen to produce that in you
[1:20:32] it is the lifegiver to the word the Holy
[1:20:35] Ghost is the lifegiver to the word it'll
[1:20:38] make the word and you live he'll bring
[1:20:40] it from a Sunday school bi uh Bible
[1:20:43] memory verse Amen to make it something
[1:20:46] that you live praise God and the devil
[1:20:49] can't take it away from you the devil
[1:20:50] can't talk you out of it the devil can't
[1:20:52] tell you well you know what that's just
[1:20:54] fanaticism and and and and you going
[1:20:56] believe the sign somewhere no you
[1:20:58] believe the word you believe the word
[1:21:00] right and the devil can't take it away
[1:21:02] from you also in that message God's
[1:21:04] power of transform brother Bram says
[1:21:06] says what kind of seed you are that
[1:21:09] shows what's in you you can't hide it
[1:21:11] whatever you are inside it shows outside
[1:21:14] you can't keep from it you can't make
[1:21:16] the tree anything but what it is see
[1:21:20] it's going to be that way the Holy
[1:21:21] Spirit trans transforms the seeds that's
[1:21:24] on the inside of it no matter what kind
[1:21:26] of seed it is it'll transform it if it's
[1:21:28] evil it'll bring forth evil if it's a
[1:21:30] hypocrite will'll bring forth a
[1:21:31] hypocrite if it's genuine word of God
[1:21:34] it'll bring forth a genuine son or
[1:21:36] daughter of God that's what it's going
[1:21:39] to produce amen praise Lord you take the
[1:21:41] word you put the spirit upon it amen and
[1:21:44] it is going to produce the life of Jesus
[1:21:46] Christ nothing else will do it amen 2
[1:21:49] Corinthians the third chapter the 6th
[1:21:50] verse says who also have made us able
[1:21:53] Ministers of the New Testament not of
[1:21:55] the letter but of the spirit for the
[1:21:57] letter
[1:21:59] kth and that's what we do we'll take
[1:22:02] this Bible right here under the
[1:22:04] anointing of a man under the anointing
[1:22:07] of a Pharisee and we will cut each other
[1:22:10] to pieces with it we'll try to bring
[1:22:13] other people down we'll try to say oh
[1:22:14] they don't believe this like this and
[1:22:16] and you know what we're you we're just
[1:22:17] trying to cut them down right we're
[1:22:19] aren't we doing what exactly what Satan
[1:22:20] did to begin well if I can't be like God
[1:22:23] I'm just going to cut down man so man
[1:22:24] can't be like
[1:22:26] God but that's what a lot of times we do
[1:22:28] with a lad we start cutting one another
[1:22:31] down well if I can't get up there and be
[1:22:33] holy and pi and and be be like Jesus
[1:22:36] Christ well I sure don't want brother
[1:22:37] Ezra to be I'm going to tell you about
[1:22:39] brother e he thinks he just a hypocrite
[1:22:41] he just thinks
[1:22:43] is see that's what that's what we do
[1:22:45] with the word we try to destroy one
[1:22:47] another with the word but that is not
[1:22:48] Jesus Christ he come to destroy the
[1:22:50] works of the devil that's what it said
[1:22:53] amen not to destroy each other you're
[1:22:55] supposed to love one another amen right
[1:22:58] amen not destroy one another the letter
[1:23:00] kth but the spirit giveth the life so
[1:23:03] yeah if we if we just got the letter oh
[1:23:06] my it's all dos and don'ts and I can't
[1:23:08] do this and I got to do that and this
[1:23:11] and so on and if I don't if I don't do
[1:23:13] this and the pastor man he's going to
[1:23:15] come visit me or or I'm going to get a
[1:23:17] letter from the from the trustees or or
[1:23:20] from the deacons or you know would get
[1:23:23] excommunicated from the Sunday school
[1:23:24] class or whatever if I don't do this I
[1:23:26] mean that's the letter kth but the
[1:23:28] spirit he brings it to life amen amen it
[1:23:32] gives you the ability to live it amen it
[1:23:34] does it for you praise God the message
[1:23:37] of trial and I don't think I gave this
[1:23:39] quote to the to the brothers back there
[1:23:41] I I preached different services on this
[1:23:44] thought and and I pull this one out it
[1:23:46] says brother Bram said in the message to
[1:23:48] Tri says now these men claim they
[1:23:50] believe but the Holy Spirit knew know
[1:23:52] nothing about it and he's the only one
[1:23:55] who can Quicken it just like your body
[1:23:57] here see your body is dead without the
[1:23:59] spirit so is the word of God dead
[1:24:03] without the Holy Ghost to Quicken it the
[1:24:06] spirit quickens the body and the Holy
[1:24:08] Ghost quickens the word so that's why we
[1:24:11] need that new birth amen for the Holy
[1:24:14] Ghost to take the word because the word
[1:24:17] was the seed the spoken word the
[1:24:19] original right amen but it takes the
[1:24:21] life of God to make you live the life of
[1:24:25] God did you get that or I need to repeat
[1:24:27] that it takes the life of God in you to
[1:24:30] make you live the life of God you can't
[1:24:33] do it Lindsay McGrady can't do it amen
[1:24:36] it's very frustrating amen and he tells
[1:24:39] he promised the Jews this in the Book of
[1:24:41] Ezekiel the 36th chapter and the 27th
[1:24:43] verse he said I will put my spirit
[1:24:46] within you and cause you to walk in my
[1:24:50] statutes and you shall keep my judg
[1:24:52] judgements and do them so it's not you
[1:24:54] doing it it's the spirit my spirit that
[1:24:56] I am going to put within you it is going
[1:24:59] to bring you into Conformity to my will
[1:25:03] and my word amen not you doing it it's
[1:25:06] not that hard what's hard is when you
[1:25:08] try to do it without it because you'll
[1:25:10] never succeed you'll never you'll be
[1:25:12] frustrated you'll never succeed amen I'm
[1:25:15] I'm getting this down to a closing Point

[1:25:42] so we're going to be brought into that
[1:25:44] image we're going to be created after
[1:25:47] his kind we're going to be manifested
[1:25:48] and that's what we are now we are now

[1:25:59] life praise God now listen this whole

[1:26:16] produce Jesus Christ in us heyen he
[1:26:21] don't want you to be like me he wants

[1:27:18] that are no longer preaching it preached
[1:27:21] it for years people that believe this
[1:27:23] message that you would have never ever
[1:27:25] imagined amen that they would go out
[1:27:27] into the world they'd cut their hair uh
[1:27:30] the women would put on their pants and
[1:27:32] do all these
[1:27:33] things it's because they had never had
[1:27:36] the spirit of God on the inside of them

[1:28:39] that pig pin wash it down scrub it down
[1:28:41] spread perfume put a bow in its High
[1:28:43] paint its toenails but the first time it

[1:29:29] the desert down at an altar at your
[1:29:32] bedside wherever it may be amen not just
[1:29:35] say well you know I I I go to church I
[1:29:38] believe the message I believe the truth
[1:29:40] the devil does
[1:29:42] too but that doesn't make him into the
[1:29:45] image of God just because he believes
[1:29:47] the message he believes it more than you
[1:29:49] believe it he knows it's more true true
[1:29:52] then you know that it's true but that
[1:29:54] don't make him a Believer that's right
[1:29:56] that does not make him in the image of
[1:29:58] Jesus Christ there's only one thing
[1:30:00] that's going to do that it's whenever
[1:30:02] his Spirit comes upon the word in your
[1:30:05] life and then it's going to cause you to
[1:30:07] walk after his statutes his judgments
[1:30:11] his Commandments his word it's no longer

[1:30:38] 44th verse he says but I say unto you

[1:30:56] little bit harder but he says love your
[1:30:59] enemies love your enemies that takes
[1:31:02] Jesus Christ amen you can't fake that
