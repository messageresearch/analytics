[1:03:18] let's go directly to the word thank you
[1:03:20] musicians each and everyone it's good to
[1:03:23] be in the house house of the Lord amen
[1:03:26] amen this is the first time that we I
[1:03:30] have been behind the pulpit with this
[1:03:32] new sound system they took down all of
[1:03:36] the speakers that were here
[1:03:39] originally uh and they have now put
[1:03:42] these
[1:03:44] towers
[1:03:46] up and so all of those speakers are gone
[1:03:49] and all of that which you are hearing is
[1:03:52] coming right out of those speakers
[1:03:55] systems um it is amazing the technology
[1:03:59] of what they can do today in fact these
[1:04:02] things are so
[1:04:04] Hightech that Jude Murray told me if you
[1:04:08] took a chair a certain spot that
[1:04:12] somebody was sitting in and you digitize
[1:04:16] that they get no sound they would sit
[1:04:19] there with no
[1:04:22] sound can you imagine
[1:04:24] they can they can take the sound and
[1:04:28] digitize it and they can eliminate
[1:04:30] somebody sitting in a seat and they the
[1:04:33] person next to him would hear the
[1:04:35] Amplified voice and that one would stay
[1:04:38] there in
[1:04:40] silence that's amazing but that's just
[1:04:43] goes to show you there can be people
[1:04:45] sitting in church and some are
[1:04:50] hearing that's
[1:04:52] right and the others are sitting right
[1:04:54] there in
[1:04:55] silence but to him that hath an ear let
[1:04:58] him hear what the spirit is
[1:05:02] saying to the
[1:05:04] church
[1:05:06] amen now to just um give a couple words
[1:05:12] here before we get into this you
[1:05:15] understand that when you read your Bible
[1:05:19] that sometimes chapters that you just
[1:05:21] turn the page and you get years
[1:05:24] of the journey whether it be Abraham
[1:05:27] whether it be Moses whether it be the
[1:05:30] life of Ezekiel or Daniel you see
[1:05:33] sometimes we we we tend to to think that
[1:05:37] those things were happening immediately
[1:05:39] and one after another but really it was
[1:05:42] a
[1:05:42] journey it was a progressive
[1:05:46] unfolding and so you look at the
[1:05:49] prophet's
[1:05:50] Ministry and what you do is sometimes
[1:05:53] you you stand back and you look at the
[1:05:57] progressive unfolding from 47 unto 65 on
[1:06:02] the taped uh archives that we have and
[1:06:06] yet the unfolding started long before
[1:06:08] that amen started at his birth God
[1:06:12] watching over him Supernatural signs he
[1:06:15] hears a voice Don't drink don't smoke
[1:06:18] don't defile your body you know the
[1:06:20] continual unfolding a woman says uh do
[1:06:24] you know there's a light following you
[1:06:26] do you know I know the day of your birth
[1:06:28] oh quit it just all of this stuff and he
[1:06:31] was seeing visions he was having all
[1:06:34] kinds of things his own Pastor told him
[1:06:37] it's of the devil so he goes out and
[1:06:40] he's praying oh God I don't want this if
[1:06:43] it's wrong I don't want it and there an
[1:06:45] angel
[1:06:46] appears and said you've had a peculiar
[1:06:49] birth and your ministry is going to be
[1:06:52] so different and as Moses was given two
[1:06:56] signs you'll be giving two signs and
[1:07:00] brother Brenham now he begins his
[1:07:02] journey in a
[1:07:05] Ministry he's inherited all kinds of
[1:07:08] false teaching the Pentecostal Church
[1:07:12] which was the most recent move of God
[1:07:16] had already now
[1:07:17] denominated and they had split up into
[1:07:20] all kinds of different groups in fact
[1:07:22] brother Brenham said
[1:07:24] it took the Catholic Church 2,000 years
[1:07:28] to get where they're at today he said
[1:07:30] the Pentecostals give it another 50
[1:07:33] years and they'll even be worse amen and
[1:07:37] so we see this continual unfolding the
[1:07:41] ministry was getting
[1:07:43] greater and yet sometimes when you see
[1:07:46] when he enters into the third pole the
[1:07:49] congregation got
[1:07:51] smaller amen
[1:07:54] but the word got far greater amen amen
[1:07:58] Luke 17:
[1:08:07] 28-30 I love to hear those pages turning
[1:08:11] amen amen thank you Lord even as brother
[1:08:15] Mike Patterson taught me as a young
[1:08:17] Carpenter one day I showed up didn't
[1:08:19] have my
[1:08:21] tools he Mike showed up on the job and I
[1:08:25] said hey Mitch throw me your Hammer hey
[1:08:28] Tom throw me your tape
[1:08:31] measure he said
[1:08:34] what you don't have your tools I forgot
[1:08:38] them he says well why don't you go
[1:08:42] home and get them and forget about the
[1:08:45] rest of the
[1:08:47] day because you should not come to to
[1:08:51] work without your tools amen
[1:08:55] and you shouldn't come to church without
[1:08:57] your sword that's right amen amen I
[1:09:00] realize some of you got it digitized you
[1:09:02] might have it on a phone or whatever but
[1:09:04] I love to hear the pages turning amen
[1:09:08] read your Bible and pray amen Luke
[1:09:11] 17 vers
[1:09:14] 28 through 30 likewise also it was in
[1:09:18] the days of
[1:09:20] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[1:09:25] they sold they planted they
[1:09:29] builded but the same day that lot went
[1:09:32] out of Sodom and rained fire and
[1:09:35] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:09:39] all even thus shall it be in the day
[1:09:43] when the son of man is revealed may God
[1:09:46] bless the reading of his word you may be
[1:09:48] seated this
[1:09:52] morning I I believe that
[1:09:56] we are
[1:09:59] living and fulfilling the prophecy of
[1:10:02] Luke 17 and3 amen this is the day of the
[1:10:07] revealing of the son of
[1:10:09] man now uh I would like you to turn with
[1:10:13] me to two other scriptures As We Lay a
[1:10:17] foundation now for the rest of our
[1:10:20] sermon here in which we want to use as a
[1:10:25] platform so in Matthew 8 and then we'll
[1:10:28] go to Matthew 9 then we'll go to Mark 10
[1:10:31] so in Matthew chap
[1:10:34] 8 verses
[1:10:38] 5-10 and then we'll just skip down to
[1:10:41] verse
[1:10:42] 13 Matthew 8 verse
[1:10:46] 5 and when Jesus was entered into
[1:10:50] Capernaum there came unto him a
[1:10:52] centurion in beseeching him so he's a
[1:10:57] gentile he's a Roman he's a Roman
[1:11:01] Centurion and saying Lord my servant
[1:11:05] lith at home sick of the py grievously
[1:11:11] tormented and Jesus saith unto him I
[1:11:15] will come and heal
[1:11:18] him the T the
[1:11:21] Centurion answered and said Lord I am
[1:11:24] not worthy that thou should come under
[1:11:26] my roof but speak the word
[1:11:31] only and my servant shall be healed amen
[1:11:35] now you have to have
[1:11:38] faith so that faith will speak
[1:11:41] back if you
[1:11:45] say do you see he's
[1:11:48] activating see now watch
[1:11:51] this for I am a man of
[1:11:54] authority having soldiers under me and I
[1:11:57] say unto this man go and he goeth and to
[1:12:00] another come and he cometh and to my
[1:12:04] servant do this and he doeth it and when
[1:12:08] Jesus heard it he marveled and said unto
[1:12:12] them that followed verily I say unto you
[1:12:16] I have not found so great faith no not
[1:12:20] in
[1:12:21] Israel what amazing he's got disciples
[1:12:24] around him he's got
[1:12:27] followers and here is a man that says
[1:12:30] I'm not worthy for you to come under my
[1:12:34] house and I'm a man of
[1:12:37] authority so he knows how that Authority
[1:12:41] works and he
[1:12:43] recognizes that Jesus had
[1:12:47] Authority in fact the Bible says at one
[1:12:50] time he raised his hand and he said uh
[1:12:53] all Heaven and Earth and all power is
[1:12:56] now given unto me brother Brenham said
[1:12:59] if you make Jesus Christ different than
[1:13:02] God he says then there was God the
[1:13:05] Father in heaven with no
[1:13:08] power but when you have a
[1:13:11] revelation when you understand that God
[1:13:14] was changing his Mass God in Mora God
[1:13:17] above us the Old Testament he said then
[1:13:20] coming down God With Us
[1:13:24] Emmanuel and then changing his mask
[1:13:27] again God in morpa God in
[1:13:31] usj in the way of the father and the Son
[1:13:35] and the Holy Spirit but he is one
[1:13:39] God
[1:13:41] now verse 13 so we can wrap this up in
[1:13:45] this portion of
[1:13:46] scripture and Jesus said unto the S
[1:13:50] Centurion go thy way as thou Hast
[1:13:56] believed so be it unto thee and his
[1:14:00] servant was healed in the self same hour
[1:14:03] now Jesus Drew attention to him and he
[1:14:06] said I've not seen such
[1:14:08] Faith No not in Israel right so the
[1:14:13] Centurion was actually activating
[1:14:16] something and God had to actually say
[1:14:20] I've Not s seen such faith
[1:14:24] now as he had told the Lord you speak
[1:14:27] the word and whatever you say it'll
[1:14:29] happen now he's activating the
[1:14:32] word he's anointing the word he's saying
[1:14:37] Lord if you'll speak to me if you
[1:14:39] understand the principle that's you
[1:14:41] don't come to church and sit there
[1:14:44] without asking you don't come to church
[1:14:47] without
[1:14:48] knocking if you have need of something
[1:14:52] you ask you seek you
[1:14:56] not because you're activating your faith
[1:15:00] and then God we'll move on the scene
[1:15:03] amen and now he tells him go thy way I
[1:15:07] don't need to lay hands on you he says
[1:15:10] go thy way as thou has believed how many
[1:15:13] of you say I
[1:15:15] believe there are times in your life
[1:15:18] when you are going to
[1:15:20] activate yes your faith amen
[1:15:25] come on Amen now let me just say this
[1:15:29] and I know I'm getting ahead of myself
[1:15:31] but I feel to say this brother Bram said
[1:15:34] the five indications of the third
[1:15:37] pull every time that it was
[1:15:41] manifested he said there was a need but
[1:15:44] I want you to know they were not in
[1:15:48] church not in a prayer
[1:15:51] line there was a need and I want all of
[1:15:55] you to understand it's going to be the
[1:15:57] same thing with you there will be a need
[1:16:00] and that need is what causes God to come
[1:16:03] on the scene because you activate your
[1:16:07] faith and I could tell every one of you
[1:16:11] if we took and gave you time to give
[1:16:14] testimony after testimony there would be
[1:16:17] times that you spoke the word you did
[1:16:21] something your kids were doing this you
[1:16:24] spoke against that guess what the kids
[1:16:27] were set free there was something inside
[1:16:30] of you that was already
[1:16:36] speaking prise the Lord the power of the
[1:16:39] spoken
[1:16:42] word turn with me to Matthew chapter
[1:16:47] 9 verses
[1:16:52] 27-30
[1:16:54] and when Jesus departed then two Blind
[1:16:57] Men followed him crying saying thou son
[1:17:02] of David have mercy on
[1:17:05] us and when he was come into the house
[1:17:08] the Blind Men came to
[1:17:11] him and Jesus saith unto them
[1:17:15] believe ye that I am able to do
[1:17:20] this they're asking for mercy
[1:17:24] they haven't even made it known but he
[1:17:26] knows their heart
[1:17:29] amen they said unto him yay Lord he's
[1:17:33] saying do you really
[1:17:35] believe they're activating now when they
[1:17:38] said
[1:17:39] yes we
[1:17:41] believe understand that you two in the
[1:17:44] same capacity when there's something
[1:17:47] that you need from God you need to say
[1:17:50] yes Lord I believe you can do it there
[1:17:53] is power with the spoken
[1:17:57] word then touched he their eyes saying
[1:18:01] according to your faith be it unto you
[1:18:04] now remember these two are Jews and the
[1:18:07] reason we know they Jews is thou son of
[1:18:10] David their approach to him is son of
[1:18:13] David Jews brother Bram said it's a
[1:18:15] Jewish custom yeah multitudes of quotes
[1:18:20] for them to have hands laid on them so
[1:18:24] do you believe that if I do this yay
[1:18:26] Lord we believe he touches them and the
[1:18:29] Bible says and they said to him yay Lord
[1:18:32] then he touched their eyes saying
[1:18:33] according to your faith be it unto
[1:18:37] you and their eyes were open and Jesus
[1:18:41] straightly
[1:18:42] charged them saying see that you know
[1:18:46] that no man know it you know there are
[1:18:49] times when there are great Miracles done
[1:18:51] and you will find throughout your
[1:18:52] scripture in Jesus says don't tell
[1:18:55] anybody what just
[1:18:59] happened because you can tell them they
[1:19:01] won't believe it anyway that's right
[1:19:05] so according to your faith be it unto
[1:19:10] you mark chap 10 so let's go now to
[1:19:14] another portion of
[1:19:17] scripture Mark 10:
[1:19:21] 46
[1:19:27] a very familiar portion of scripture in
[1:19:30] fact brother Brenham preaches about
[1:19:33] blind bmus multitudes of
[1:19:36] times and they came to
[1:19:39] Jericho and as he went out of Jericho
[1:19:42] with his disciples a great number of
[1:19:47] people blind bmus the son of
[1:19:50] tus Sat by the
[1:19:53] Highway side
[1:19:56] begging and when he had heard that it
[1:19:59] was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry
[1:20:02] out saying Jesus thou son of David have
[1:20:07] mercy on
[1:20:10] me and many charged him that he should
[1:20:13] hold his peace and he cried the more a
[1:20:16] great deal the son of David have mercy
[1:20:19] on me see some people will tell you hey
[1:20:22] shut up he's not going to listen to you
[1:20:24] on but when there's something inside of
[1:20:27] you and you have a need hey the more
[1:20:30] people it doesn't matter who it is that
[1:20:32] tries to silence you speak up let God
[1:20:38] know and Jesus Stood
[1:20:41] Still and commanded him to be called and
[1:20:45] they and they called the blind man
[1:20:47] saying unto him be of good Comfort rise
[1:20:51] he calleth thee and he casting away His
[1:20:54] Garment Rose and came to
[1:20:58] Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:21:01] him What wilt that I should do unto
[1:21:05] thee the blind man said unto him
[1:21:08] Lord that I might receive my
[1:21:12] sight and Jesus said unto
[1:21:16] him go thy
[1:21:20] way thy faith has made thee whole than
[1:21:25] amen and immediately he received his
[1:21:29] sight and follow Jesus in the
[1:21:34] way what do you want me to do to
[1:21:36] you Lord that I might receive my
[1:21:43] sight and Jesus said go thy
[1:21:47] way thy
[1:21:49] faith thy
[1:21:51] faith has made thee
[1:21:54] whole and immediately received his sight
[1:21:58] I'd like to title my sermon this morning
[1:22:00] continuing on with the thought of the
[1:22:03] revealing of the son of man this is part
[1:22:06] six and I want to take uh this direction
[1:22:12] this morning to be it unto you according
[1:22:16] to your
[1:22:19] faith now I could show you multitudes
[1:22:22] and multitudes of quotes where the
[1:22:24] prophet of God
[1:22:26] said oh you just touched
[1:22:29] him he was using my voice but it's not
[1:22:33] me it's him amen he said I've got
[1:22:36] nothing I'm just all I'm doing is
[1:22:39] allowing him to use my voice and he says
[1:22:44] really you touched him amen and I want
[1:22:48] you to understand faith is what is
[1:22:51] quickened that you touch him now
[1:22:56] sometimes there are touch points brother
[1:22:58] Brenham said at times that some people
[1:23:02] because of the way they're taught he
[1:23:04] says as an example you out there in
[1:23:07] radioland reach out right now if you
[1:23:09] have faith touch that radio you see
[1:23:13] sometimes they feel they have to do
[1:23:15] something and so brother brandham had
[1:23:18] inherited all kinds of teachings
[1:23:23] and now he's been given a a
[1:23:25] Ministry now watch out God has watched
[1:23:28] over his gift he tried smoking he tried
[1:23:32] drinking and guess what
[1:23:35] supernaturally God interceded why
[1:23:38] because he's got a prophetic Ministry
[1:23:40] now he doesn't understand he's a young
[1:23:43] boy he doesn't understand these things
[1:23:45] so uh this ministry of his is unfolding
[1:23:49] the angel said you're going to pray for
[1:23:53] kings and monarchs I'm giving you two
[1:23:56] signs a sign in the hand and discernment
[1:23:59] brother
[1:24:01] Brenham uses the terminology the first
[1:24:04] and second pull he says now I will be
[1:24:08] with you and and he says you'll have a
[1:24:11] sign in the hand he said people will
[1:24:14] come up there my hand will change a
[1:24:16] color he said now it's got nothing to do
[1:24:18] with me he said it's just a gift that I
[1:24:21] have and he told people look at my hand
[1:24:24] now it's normal but watch when I put it
[1:24:27] upon your hand he says it changes he
[1:24:30] said is that true and and he would
[1:24:34] perhaps talk them to them for a moment
[1:24:36] and he says but you see my hand is still
[1:24:39] got a wrong color to it he said your
[1:24:42] faith hasn't Rose enough yet and he
[1:24:45] would talk to him and all of a sudden he
[1:24:46] said now look at my hand thus sayith the
[1:24:49] lord it's gone see what I'm saying they
[1:24:52] what what they were doing is they were
[1:24:54] activating their faith it took something
[1:24:58] for them to see something
[1:25:01] tangible but while he was doing that
[1:25:04] there were people in the congregation
[1:25:07] they're saying oh my because brother
[1:25:09] Brenham said why you out there he's the
[1:25:12] same yesterday today and forever you
[1:25:16] don't need to come up here you don't
[1:25:18] need some man to lay hands on you if
[1:25:21] you'll believe he is here now why
[1:25:23] there's a faith Bank all through this
[1:25:25] building if you'll just believe and have
[1:25:29] faith in God
[1:25:34] hallelujah so in Psalms 107: 19 and
[1:25:42] 20 then they cry unto the Lord in their
[1:25:46] trouble and he saveth them out of their
[1:25:50] distresses you ever been there
[1:25:53] and he sent his
[1:25:55] word and healed them and delivered them
[1:25:59] from their
[1:26:01] destructions what did he send his word
[1:26:04] amen his word is God's will so he sends
[1:26:08] the word Now understand that God uses
[1:26:12] his word in multitudes of ways he can
[1:26:15] send a minister he can send a friend he
[1:26:19] can have somebody sing a song
[1:26:23] yeah sometimes it takes a
[1:26:27] mountain sometimes it takes a
[1:26:29] flood sometimes it takes all these
[1:26:32] distresses you go through cuz God needed
[1:26:35] to get your
[1:26:37] attention are you understanding me amen
[1:26:41] and so it was even in the prophet's
[1:26:43] Ministry there he was one time he went
[1:26:47] to a Pentecostal meeting came back and
[1:26:50] told hope oh my I have found some people
[1:26:54] and you know here he was Missionary
[1:26:56] Baptist you all know the story I'm not
[1:26:58] going to take the time his mother-in-law
[1:27:02] said don't you dare take my daughter to
[1:27:05] that
[1:27:06] trash how many know that so for the next
[1:27:10] year and a half or so he pulls away from
[1:27:13] it he listens to
[1:27:15] Mama I want all of you to understand the
[1:27:19] Bible says sometimes they of your own
[1:27:21] house household can become your worst
[1:27:25] enemy it says if you're going to follow
[1:27:28] Jesus there might come a time when
[1:27:30] father is against son and mother against
[1:27:34] daughter you understand that right so if
[1:27:38] you're going to follow him you've got to
[1:27:39] have the
[1:27:41] mindset even if others tell me not to go
[1:27:44] if God's calling me I'll go
[1:27:48] amen Comes the
[1:27:51] Flood you all know the
[1:27:54] story his wife is getting very sick
[1:27:58] she's actually crossed over in death he
[1:28:01] comes up to her oh Hope Oh Hope come
[1:28:05] back to
[1:28:06] me her eyes open why'd you call me back
[1:28:11] bill now here's a mother that's got two
[1:28:15] children yes and she didn't say how are
[1:28:19] my
[1:28:21] children are you taking care of
[1:28:24] them and why did you call me back bill
[1:28:28] it's just like you preached about why
[1:28:32] it's so wonderful and he says
[1:28:35] honey um you know he's talking to her a
[1:28:38] little
[1:28:39] bit and she says come here bill I want
[1:28:42] to tell you something he says I didn't
[1:28:46] come sit down I knelt down she said I
[1:28:50] know where the problem is we listen to
[1:28:53] Mama and she said on her deathbed Bill
[1:28:58] promise
[1:28:59] me you will take my children and you
[1:29:02] will raise them up amen my do you
[1:29:07] understand and so now hope
[1:29:11] passes and brother brandham you know he
[1:29:14] he he's having a hard time missing
[1:29:19] hope and then he comes and guess what
[1:29:22] they call him on the radio William
[1:29:24] brandom come to the hospital your baby's
[1:29:28] dying oh my I want you to understand now
[1:29:33] he's in a a real
[1:29:36] complex because and he said Lord I might
[1:29:40] understand you taking my
[1:29:42] wife but not my little Sharon
[1:29:45] Rose
[1:29:47] no oh God not my little Sharon Rose
[1:29:54] yeah he says I prayed he said a black
[1:29:58] sheet come down right there in front of
[1:30:00] him he said I knew God rejected
[1:30:03] me can you
[1:30:05] imagine he says there's something spoke
[1:30:08] to me see I thought I thought you said
[1:30:11] he's a good God how many of you have
[1:30:13] ever been in a time in a situation dist
[1:30:15] stressful might be family might be a
[1:30:18] death in them family might be you lose
[1:30:20] your job you might be something it just
[1:30:22] turns you upside down turns you around
[1:30:24] and you really don't know what's going
[1:30:26] on and God is trying to get your
[1:30:33] attention and he's asking God oh
[1:30:37] God not don't take my baby he's
[1:30:42] rejected he said
[1:30:45] well if that's how he's going to
[1:30:48] be all this that I've done for him and
[1:30:50] he said he he was just about ready to
[1:30:53] say well if that's how he's and he said
[1:30:56] all of a
[1:30:57] sudden how many of you have ever had
[1:31:00] that anchor
[1:31:01] hold you're about ready to say if that's
[1:31:05] the way he or if that's the way the
[1:31:08] message people or if that's the way that
[1:31:11] the message preachers or if that's the
[1:31:14] way that somebody who claims to be the
[1:31:16] bridey chrry treats me well I tell you
[1:31:20] what but something
[1:31:23] holds how many of you H have been
[1:31:27] disappointed
[1:31:28] discouraged perhaps by somebody in the
[1:31:31] message I will say this I've had
[1:31:34] multitudes of times oh yes multitudes
[1:31:39] but I've never had the message
[1:31:41] discourage me I've never had Jesus
[1:31:45] Christ he's never betrayed me he's never
[1:31:48] told others what I've told him in secret
[1:31:51] he's never
[1:31:55] shared hallu come on now somebody give
[1:31:59] him praise this
[1:32:03] morning because there is a friend who
[1:32:06] sticks with thee closer than a
[1:32:10] brother that's the truth he sent his
[1:32:14] word and it healed the people delivered
[1:32:17] them you see when the word has been sent
[1:32:20] to you listen to this because you're
[1:32:22] going to catch it bits and pieces of
[1:32:24] this throughout this
[1:32:26] sermon when the word has been revealed
[1:32:29] to you it has healing virtue in it amen
[1:32:34] it has Deliverance virtue in
[1:32:38] it Faith looks to the promise not to the
[1:32:43] problem
[1:32:45] Faith activated is greater than a prayer
[1:32:50] line come on amen Faith reaches out and
[1:32:54] touches him amen faith in God's word is
[1:32:58] greater than the laying on of
[1:33:01] hands because Jesus said I've not seen
[1:33:05] such great
[1:33:06] faith no not in all of
[1:33:09] Israel he's making a
[1:33:11] point if you understand God's Authority
[1:33:16] on and you understand how the God
[1:33:19] works you don't need him to go and lay
[1:33:23] hands all you need to do is say Lord I
[1:33:25] believe your word and your word says
[1:33:28] you're a Healer therefore I receive that
[1:33:31] healing virtue because by your stripes I
[1:33:35] am healed and you're now
[1:33:38] activating the word of God and God says
[1:33:42] I see
[1:33:47] Faith
[1:33:50] amen now
[1:33:52] my wife reminds me even as she sends me
[1:33:55] a text message before I
[1:33:58] preach don't go off and tell stories or
[1:34:01] you know and stay focused so I'm going
[1:34:03] to but I'm going to tell a story and it
[1:34:05] just happens to be one I've told you
[1:34:08] here before but the rest of you haven't
[1:34:09] heard it so for their sake I'll tell
[1:34:11] them brother Mike was preaching up in
[1:34:13] Flagstaff and boy it was a great sermon
[1:34:16] I believe that it really doesn't matter
[1:34:18] who it is that's preaching I believe
[1:34:20] that if you have faith
[1:34:22] in God God is obligated to to have that
[1:34:27] Minister speak something to you why it's
[1:34:30] not the man it's the
[1:34:32] gift and I tell you I was sick oh I tell
[1:34:37] you what nowadays people when they're
[1:34:39] sick they stay home it used to be in the
[1:34:42] Bible when they were sick they brought
[1:34:44] them to church they brought them through
[1:34:47] the roof when they couldn't get in they
[1:34:50] oh somebody said amen you know don't
[1:34:52] look at me like I'm crazy it used to be
[1:34:55] that when you were sick you still came
[1:34:59] now I understanding let's be politically
[1:35:01] correct if you got covid-19 stay
[1:35:07] home but you know what I mean brother
[1:35:09] Mike was preaching and oh I was sick and
[1:35:12] quite honestly I don't remember a whole
[1:35:15] lot of what he was saying I was just
[1:35:18] sitting there sweating I was ready to
[1:35:20] vomit I I I was a couple times if you've
[1:35:24] ever had that flu like symptom and I
[1:35:26] tell you what vomiting I hate to
[1:35:30] vomit and I do
[1:35:33] anything I breathe I do all this stuff
[1:35:35] because I hate to do that and I was just
[1:35:39] about ready to run I'm telling
[1:35:41] Sandy get out of the way get out of the
[1:35:43] way I'm going to run you know and I
[1:35:45] don't you know want
[1:35:50] to and I can't wait until brother Mike
[1:35:53] is done with a
[1:35:55] sermon and like many of
[1:36:01] you but what I was
[1:36:03] saying is he if he will say is there
[1:36:07] anybody here sick
[1:36:09] today oh my see what I was doing is
[1:36:12] activating my faith and I was sick I was
[1:36:14] so sick I my I I I tell you and he said
[1:36:19] if anybody is sick here he says and you
[1:36:23] feel to come down and be prayed for he
[1:36:26] says well now's your time well I'm ready
[1:36:30] to like this and as soon as I now watch
[1:36:33] here's the testimony as soon as I stood
[1:36:37] up I was healed amen
[1:36:41] hallelujah it immediately left me I
[1:36:44] didn't have to go forward yeah all I did
[1:36:47] was
[1:36:48] say because my my my Faith was reaching
[1:36:52] out if he'll just say stand up come
[1:36:54] forward whatever and as soon as I stood
[1:36:57] up because I
[1:36:59] knew the daddy was there on the scene
[1:37:03] hallu have you ever been in a situation
[1:37:06] and if Dad is there or when Daddy walks
[1:37:08] through the door everything's okay now
[1:37:10] Dad's here he can handle
[1:37:13] it I felt like he's here all of a sudden
[1:37:18] I just completely I knew it I quit
[1:37:22] sweating I uh the the nausea left me I
[1:37:27] just was
[1:37:29] immediately
[1:37:31] healed God you know Jesus said many
[1:37:34] times rise and be healed the
[1:37:39] rising the rising was causing the
[1:37:43] healing because you were activating your
[1:37:46] faith on God's word he sent his word and
[1:37:50] it healed them amen hallelujah amen now
[1:37:56] remember brother Brenham said there was
[1:37:58] one scripture that he says I stayed away
[1:38:01] from as a young man because I never
[1:38:04] understood it I'm going to read this
[1:38:06] scripture Mark
[1:38:08] 11: 20-
[1:38:11] 23 and in the morning as they passed by
[1:38:13] they saw the fig tree dried up from the
[1:38:16] roots and Peter calling to remember
[1:38:19] saith unto him Master behold the frig
[1:38:21] tree which thou cursed is withered away
[1:38:26] and Jesus
[1:38:27] answering saith unto
[1:38:30] him have faith in
[1:38:34] God
[1:38:38] wow for verily I say unto you that
[1:38:42] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:38:46] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:38:50] the see thou shall not doubt in his
[1:38:54] heart but shall believe that those
[1:38:57] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:39:00] he shall
[1:39:02] have whatsoever he saith amen now
[1:39:06] there's power with the spoken word
[1:39:08] that's right in fact they begin to catch
[1:39:10] this with brother Brenham and they said
[1:39:12] brother Brenham this third pull is it
[1:39:14] got anything to do with speaking the
[1:39:16] word
[1:39:19] absolutely speak to the the storm speak
[1:39:21] to the huh squirrel speak speak
[1:39:26] speak there's power in the spoken
[1:39:30] word
[1:39:32] so brother Brenham said I can never
[1:39:34] preach on that because I didn't fully
[1:39:36] understand it now let me show you here
[1:39:40] how he explains this in
[1:39:42] 1958 in a sermon Escape hither and come
[1:39:45] quickly notice Cain's
[1:39:48] people Cain's people were smart science
[1:39:51] IST people can's people was
[1:39:54] religious had big churches educated
[1:39:57] Scholars they went to working in science
[1:40:01] they brought out metal they built houses
[1:40:03] they were great Builders and great
[1:40:04] things look at it today look on the
[1:40:06] other side how religious they are but
[1:40:10] the people that went into the ark was
[1:40:11] the people who were humble
[1:40:14] Farmers on the other side the great
[1:40:17] intellectual conception when the true of
[1:40:21] God has the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:40:25] not written word not by written word but
[1:40:28] by spiritually revealed
[1:40:32] truth because you can have the word and
[1:40:35] if it's not spiritually revealed to you
[1:40:38] it remains a closed book that's
[1:40:41] right amen oh blessed be his name God
[1:40:44] reveals himself to an individual and he
[1:40:47] quickly becomes deity on the inside of
[1:40:49] him he's a son or daughter of God speak
[1:40:51] to this mountain don't doubt it'll move
[1:40:54] you get it see so here was brother
[1:40:58] Brenham early part of his ministry in
[1:41:01] fact what's the first sermon that we
[1:41:03] have recorded every time you research
[1:41:06] the message what's the first sermon that
[1:41:09] brother we have on archive tapes faith
[1:41:13] is the
[1:41:15] substance can you imagine of 1100 plus
[1:41:19] tapes the first one you think it's
[1:41:23] coincidence he said faith is a substance
[1:41:27] amen and so now he begins to to preach
[1:41:30] on that so I want to just go on to bring
[1:41:36] this out because when the Apostle Paul
[1:41:39] was saying I want to by God's grace and
[1:41:43] if he'll help us I want to go beyond the
[1:41:46] doctrine of laying on of hands and of
[1:41:48] Faith towards God and these things he
[1:41:51] said if God
[1:41:53] permits now imagine there was somebody
[1:41:56] there there was probably all kinds of
[1:41:57] preachers that were freaking out saying
[1:42:00] what he don't believe in those things
[1:42:02] anymore let's go beyond the doctrines of
[1:42:04] Christ oh my
[1:42:08] goodness he's trying to get them to a
[1:42:11] higher
[1:42:13] understanding have faith in God did you
[1:42:17] know that God had to Blind him to open
[1:42:19] his eyes that's
[1:42:21] right sometimes God's got to do
[1:42:24] something drastic to
[1:42:27] you yes Amen to get your attention God
[1:42:32] blinds his eyes here's this
[1:42:34] high-tempered hooknose Jew going along
[1:42:39] putting people in prison holding the
[1:42:42] coats of those that stone
[1:42:45] stepen and he's he's
[1:42:48] persecuting and he's and guess what God
[1:42:51] Appears to him and blinds his eyes he
[1:42:54] falls off and into the dust he goes
[1:42:57] sometimes God's got to grind you into
[1:42:59] the dust oh God oh God why are you doing
[1:43:03] that yeah it's our
[1:43:05] purpose I have appeared unto thee for a
[1:43:09] purpose blinded him and there he's got
[1:43:12] to be L around oh God and now he's very
[1:43:16] Hey listen when something like that very
[1:43:18] drastic happens to you you start
[1:43:21] catching up on your prayer
[1:43:23] life how many of you know that when
[1:43:27] immediately something happens oh my oh
[1:43:30] God oh God Let's Make a
[1:43:33] Deal huh yeah if you'll deliver me oh
[1:43:37] God I'll be better I I promise you
[1:43:41] see so
[1:43:43] now watch this brother Brenham in the
[1:43:46] healing of gyrus
[1:43:48] daughter see well she Stoops down and
[1:43:51] got away from that fellow moved over
[1:43:53] here here stood the general board so
[1:43:56] there she had trouble again so she slips
[1:44:00] on down where the fisherman was and here
[1:44:03] she comes crawling up between her feet
[1:44:06] moving up like that look up and see
[1:44:09] where who's that and she touched His
[1:44:12] Garment and said that's just all I need
[1:44:17] so she went on about there and she said
[1:44:19] oh I'm so thankful I'm Healed for she
[1:44:23] felt in her body something done uh
[1:44:26] something way down in here said that's
[1:44:28] enough that's all you need oh little
[1:44:31] woman crawl the same way tonight through

[1:44:42] days of Miracles is passed you got to
[1:44:45] come up to the platform you got to have
[1:44:47] hands laid on you crawl right but
[1:44:50] between there until you touch His

[1:44:56] will happen down here that says I don't
[1:44:58] need to get to the platform don't need
[1:45:01] nothing now watch what happens then
[1:45:04] watch what he'll do Jesus turned around
[1:45:06] and looked around and said who touched

[1:45:17] out Deliverance is brought yes he's the
[1:45:21] same yesterday today and forever
[1:45:24] amen amen those vindications of the
[1:45:28] third poll were sovereignly
[1:45:30] given they weren't in church they
[1:45:33] weren't in a prayer line it was under
[1:45:36] circumstances of a daily life amen is
[1:45:39] that right I want you to understand that
[1:45:43] a lot of times people are thinking for
[1:45:44] great big things to happen in the church
[1:45:47] yeah but listen God comes and speaks to
[1:45:52] you in all your
[1:45:57] circumstances
[1:45:59] Lord sometimes it'll come to you even by
[1:46:02] a mother's intuition that's
[1:46:05] right mothers you've got children
[1:46:08] they're all different ages and different
[1:46:11] personalities and temperament this one
[1:46:14] sister they had a this was out in the
[1:46:18] the backside of the peaks of FL
[1:46:21] staff and Johnny Dalton he had his wife
[1:46:24] there Kathy and they were out playing
[1:46:27] and the kids were playing hide and go
[1:46:29] seek and they had taken an old
[1:46:32] refrigerator you remember the kind of
[1:46:35] refrigerators you got the lock on the
[1:46:36] front there and you pull it and it opens
[1:46:39] up well the refrigerator quit working so
[1:46:42] they took it and just like you do when
[1:46:45] you're out there and you got a piece of
[1:46:46] land and you don't have time to take it
[1:46:49] to the dump you just put it on your your
[1:46:50] property and the whole property looks
[1:46:52] like a
[1:46:55] dump so the kids are playing they're
[1:46:58] hiding behind this and that and one of
[1:47:00] the little boys he reached and and
[1:47:03] opened that refrigerator this is a good
[1:47:05] place to hide and he took it and he
[1:47:07] pulled the door
[1:47:09] shut now imagine now there was no Panic
[1:47:12] Button there was no way to release from
[1:47:15] the inside and and Kathy here's her
[1:47:18] testimony she said I was was just
[1:47:20] washing dishes or doing something and
[1:47:23] something said something's
[1:47:26] wrong and she immediately as a mother
[1:47:29] will do she thought my children kids

[1:47:43] different ones are coming out from here
[1:47:44] and there but she can't find one and she
[1:47:47] says oh where is he oh please come out
[1:47:50] where are
[1:47:51] you and finally she comes over to the
[1:47:54] refrigerator opens the door and the
[1:47:57] little boy had turned blue and he was
[1:48:00] lost his oxygen he was unconscious and
[1:48:03] he fell out of the
[1:48:07] refrigerator can you
[1:48:09] imagine there are
[1:48:11] times that you will be given intuitions
[1:48:14] you'll be given
[1:48:16] knowledge you'll be given that spirit of
[1:48:19] discernment yes you will know there will
[1:48:22] be times in your life that God

[1:52:40] there may come a time when your little
[1:52:42] child is going out there and brother Ram
[1:52:44] says you see little Johnny heading for
[1:52:46] the street and there's cars and trucks
[1:52:49] running up and down and and he says now
[1:52:53] if you're a real loving mother oh
[1:52:56] Johnny don't go towards the street oh my
[1:53:00] cute little baby whom the world revolves

[1:53:15] Ronald Allan
[1:53:17] Peterson I knew here's stood
[1:53:21] up it's even standing on top of my head
[1:53:24] right
[1:53:25] now woo I knew I was in
[1:53:28] trouble but you might save your child's
[1:53:31] life that's right by teaching them when
[1:53:34] I say come
[1:53:36] come you understand okay that that that
[1:53:39] that that that's just a little teaching
[1:53:42] lesson there uh it's free it's okay take
[1:53:44] it if you think you're you're okay and
[1:53:47] your kids are fine I I I pray you're
[1:53:50] teaching them and raising them correctly
[1:53:53] amen
[1:53:56] now watch this every one of those five
[1:53:59] indications of the third pool it was the
[1:54:02] need that brought the
[1:54:03] situation to a
[1:54:06] climax it was sovereignly given it
[1:54:09] wasn't something out there in fact he
[1:54:11] says Oh my he says here I am fishing and
[1:54:15] he says something is telling me there's
[1:54:18] going to be a resurrection
[1:54:20] now this is hours before he's just
[1:54:23] feeling well maybe Joe he's he he had a
[1:54:26] little kid 2-year-old boy and the little
[1:54:28] kidney he he suffocated it it
[1:54:31] died okay he said maybe a little kitten
[1:54:35] maybe this in that well that that
[1:54:37] brother catches that fish pulls the
[1:54:39] innards out of it throws it out there he
[1:54:41] said we cut two or 300 of those things
[1:54:45] we cut them up and used them for bait
[1:54:47] the day
[1:54:48] before
[1:54:50] why would God be interested in a little
[1:54:52] tiny Blu
[1:54:53] Gill you shot your last
[1:54:56] wad he sitting there and all of a
[1:54:59] sudden presence of God said speak to
[1:55:02] that little fish a
[1:55:04] fish he says oh my a fish he said I got
[1:55:09] 50 lunatic children right now in
[1:55:12] hospitals that need to be prayed
[1:55:14] for and he says and God told me speak
[1:55:17] that little Fish Little Fish in the name
[1:55:19] of Jes Jesus Christ I give you your life
[1:55:21] back all of a sudden down he
[1:55:25] goes hey I guarantee it if you'd have
[1:55:27] been in the boat and you'd have been
[1:55:30] there you wouldn't have thought no big
[1:55:32] deal well the fish wasn't really dead it
[1:55:36] just kind of some kind of you know how
[1:55:38] fish you throw them in a in a boat and
[1:55:40] they sit there and flop around
[1:55:43] and throw them back in the water they
[1:55:46] might revive all a sudden they go down
[1:55:47] so what I'm saying God sovereignly doing
[1:55:51] something that is so far beyond what our
[1:55:55] human thinking would be why would God
[1:55:58] waste his energy on a little
[1:56:01] fish because his eyes is on a
[1:56:04] sparrow tell me he doesn't watch over
[1:56:07] [Applause]
[1:56:10] you now watch he's telling these stories
[1:56:14] to had he right he's telling a story
[1:56:17] about speaking of
[1:56:20] squirrel in fact the most detailed
[1:56:23] version of the
[1:56:25] squirrels you will find on the sermon
[1:56:28] speak to the mountain speak to this
[1:56:31] mountain he gives a very very detailed
[1:56:33] in fact you know he speak squirrels into
[1:56:36] existence two
[1:56:38] times one are gray squirrels one are red
[1:56:40] squirrels one in Indiana the other in
[1:56:46] Kentucky but what's amazing after he
[1:56:48] gives all these details he says
[1:56:52] so he says Lord is this what you've been
[1:56:56] trying to get my attention
[1:56:58] on this is the change in my Ministry why
[1:57:03] this is the first time it's used on
[1:57:05] human
[1:57:08] beings he's talking about wow had he

[1:57:25] something you can be reading your Bible

[1:57:30] there will be something that will
[1:57:31] Quicken to you and something will move
[1:57:34] inside of you and you will say that's
[1:57:36] nothing but the truth amen
[1:57:41] oh it was so pleasing to God as soon as

[2:02:53] don't do that and everything see um
[2:02:56] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[2:03:01] and forever amen so let's go on here I
[2:03:03] want to uh so he's talking about a
[2:03:06] change of ministry he preaches sermons
[2:03:08] on it change of ministry present stage
[2:03:10] of my Ministry because the word is
[2:03:13] unfolding to him and it says the angel
[2:03:15] said as long as you hold on to the first
[2:03:17] B what is the first first pull healing
[2:03:20] signed in the hand what is the second
[2:03:22] pull
[2:03:23] discernment right so he says as long as
[2:03:26] you hold on to the first the second
[2:03:28] can't come you hold on to the second the
[2:03:30] third can't come and guess what bill you
[2:03:33] got to be a whole lot more
[2:03:36] sincere he said that third pole the
[2:03:38] revealing of the word the son of man the
[2:03:42] Seven Seals opening he is those
[2:03:46] seals do you understand when you when
[2:03:49] you catch this ministry of the Prophet
[2:03:51] it's totally
[2:03:53] unfolding and you've got to unfold with
[2:03:56] it and if you think brother brenon
[2:03:59] because he says oh my would have made a
[2:04:01] horrible mistake I went and looked over
[2:04:04] my notes in all the sermons prior to the
[2:04:07] opening of the first seal the mighty
[2:04:09] conqueror who is this white horse rider
[2:04:11] we all know who it is it's Jesus
[2:04:14] Christ then he opens the first seal oh
[2:04:17] my as 100 miles from the
[2:04:21] truth so the word comes he sent the word
[2:04:25] and corrects the prophet do you
[2:04:27] understand he says oh it it bears that
[2:04:30] we must wait before God trying not going
[2:04:33] by carnal knowledge not by carnal
[2:04:36] understanding not by hislop's to
[2:04:39] Babylons or any of that he says I waited
[2:04:42] before God and he said oh my the first
[2:04:44] seal who is it it's the Antichrist amen
[2:04:47] wow yeah now I've had some tell me well
[2:04:50] it's both you tell your kids that and
[2:04:53] they think you're
[2:04:54] nuts it can't be both so the prophet
[2:04:58] when he preached something that wasn't
[2:05:00] exactly right God is obligated to come
[2:05:04] and preach excuse me teach his
[2:05:08] Prophet a lesson so he comes lip to
[2:05:13] ear yeah no that's the Antichrist that's
[2:05:17] that nickan spirit
[2:05:20] now watch
[2:05:21] this you talk about power in your
[2:05:26] voice pergan Church age brother brenman
[2:05:29] is quoting Romans
[2:05:30] 8 verse 9 If any man have not the spirit
[2:05:35] of Christ he is none of
[2:05:38] his there it is he is spirit and he is
[2:05:42] life that's exactly what the word is
[2:05:45] that's exactly what Jesus is he is the
[2:05:48] word word so when a spirit born
[2:05:51] Spirit-filled man in faith takes the
[2:05:53] word into his heart and places it upon
[2:05:56] his lips why that is the
[2:06:01] same what's he say as deity speaking
[2:06:07] Every Mountain has got to go Satan
[2:06:10] cannot stand before that man I want you
[2:06:13] to understand listen my brother my
[2:06:15] sister it is not you just all of a
[2:06:17] sudden getting inspired and you know
[2:06:19] what you know that new car I've been
[2:06:23] wanting
[2:06:26] Lamborghini I speak it in the name of
[2:06:29] Jesus that's not God's will so the Bible
[2:06:32] says sometimes when you pray you pray
[2:06:34] you
[2:06:35] miss H you know what you might have
[2:06:38] wanted a Lamborghini and he gave you a
[2:06:41] Volkswagen you understand so it's
[2:06:44] praying according to God's will not
[2:06:46] according to your desire that's
[2:06:50] right
[2:06:53] amen the same as deity
[2:06:57] speaking
[2:07:00] understand
[2:07:01] Hallelujah you got to have faith in God
[2:07:05] it is faith that operates the gift in
[2:07:08] your life to make
[2:07:11] manifestations no speak no action no
[2:07:16] manifestation very good
[2:07:19] he spoke to the word and the word spoke
[2:07:22] back to him because faith became
[2:07:25] activated and it was be it unto thee
[2:07:29] according to thy
[2:07:31] faith now watch this here's in the
[2:07:34] sermon conferences

[2:08:45] what we need more repentance amen do you
[2:08:48] see where he's putting the
[2:08:51] emphasis not this super duper he says
[2:08:53] you know what I've done remember William
[2:08:55] brandham you went out here and taught
[2:08:57] Pentecostal preachers you tried to teach
[2:09:00] them Supernatural things but they're
[2:09:01] Pentecostal babies right well I show you
[2:09:04] how to fish watch this first second pull
[2:09:07] and everything huh sh you're getting
[2:09:09] your line all tangled up in times like
[2:09:13] this quit trying to tell everybody quit
[2:09:17] trying to teach it he said now this time
[2:09:20] that third P sh don't tell nobody this a
[2:09:23] secret this time when you cast that word
[2:09:26] out there let it run real deep and you
[2:09:28] guys that know how to fish he said you
[2:09:30] don't want that little fish you bump
[2:09:33] it next thing you know you let Let It Go
[2:09:36] deeper Let It Go deeper Peter have you
[2:09:38] caught any fish no cast The Net one more
[2:09:41] time we fished all night but at Thy word
[2:09:44] watch this at Thy word so now he obeys
[2:09:47] the word he cast and guess what he got a
[2:09:50] whole shipload worth of
[2:09:53] fish understand that God is trying to
[2:09:57] get us to rise our faith higher than all
[2:10:02] of the stuff we've been
[2:10:04] taught do you understand oh
[2:10:09] my that's what you don't hardly hear
[2:10:12] preachers telling people to repent
[2:10:15] anymore
[2:10:17] huh
[2:10:24] in the day when the son of man is being
[2:10:26] revealed here we are living in that
[2:10:30] day in Matthew 9 verse 27 and when Jesus
[2:10:36] departed then two Blind Men come crying
[2:10:39] saying thou son of David have mercy
[2:10:41] believe that I'm able to do this we read
[2:10:43] the scripture I wanted to read it again
[2:10:46] yay Lord then he touched their eyes and
[2:10:48] according to your faith be it unto you
[2:10:49] and their eyes were open Jesus
[2:10:51] straightly charged him saying that no
[2:10:53] man know it it's your faith in God that
[2:10:55] causes the
[2:10:57] miracle why I I looked up I typed in
[2:11:00] throughout the message you find out
[2:11:02] according to thy faith 75 different
[2:11:04] quotes he says you didn't touch me be it
[2:11:08] unto you according to your faith you
[2:11:10] didn't touch me why God just used my
[2:11:13] voice don't you understand the gift that
[2:11:16] the prophet of God had
[2:11:18] of the first and second pull got the
[2:11:21] attention of the people but he said now
[2:11:24] watch it's Faith out there for everyone
[2:11:27] that comes up here he said there's 50
[2:11:31] out there that's catching it
[2:11:33] amen he said it's my Ministry I'm to
[2:11:36] pray for the sick that's what I do I'm
[2:11:39] getting the attention of the people but
[2:11:42] watch when he goes
[2:11:44] into uh end time evangelism guess what
[2:11:47] it it ain't to the denominations no more
[2:11:51] look at it he's not he doesn't go out
[2:11:54] there to him anymore in fact he says you
[2:11:56] know what all these years of my going
[2:12:00] out here in Durban South Africa and all
[2:12:04] of the big meetings where thousands upon
[2:12:07] thousands of people
[2:12:09] come he says it's never been God's
[2:12:12] perfect
[2:12:13] will he said I've worked in the
[2:12:16] permissive will of God how many of you
[2:12:18] have studied this you know he says you
[2:12:21] know what I've done I've mixed
[2:12:23] evangelism with a prophetic gift said
[2:12:26] what Good's it done I tell this guy his
[2:12:29] name where he's from his
[2:12:31] address I'm not making fun of that I'm
[2:12:33] just saying brother Bram said what good
[2:12:36] has it done I tell all these guy I tell
[2:12:38] one guy all these things and the next
[2:12:40] guy God doesn't show me and one guy
[2:12:42] thinks I'm a God the next guy thinks I'm
[2:12:44] a devil he said what Good's it done as
[2:12:47] far as I'm concerned
[2:12:48] he said I got a complex I lost the
[2:12:51] feeling for the people how many of you
[2:12:52] know that he said well I'm going up in
[2:12:55] the mountains up there in Canada I
[2:12:57] always wanted to be a Trapper grow my
[2:12:58] hair long he said and when God wants to
[2:13:01] give me thus sayith the Lord I come
[2:13:02] stomping out and tell him thus sayith
[2:13:04] the Lord go back up in the
[2:13:06] mountain he said yeah you do your wife
[2:13:09] will leave
[2:13:10] you and you'll become a
[2:13:12] bomb you remember even the vision and
[2:13:15] different thing remember those two guys
[2:13:17] eating there right next to him and one
[2:13:18] guy lets out a big old
[2:13:21] belch brother R said there's a he tells
[2:13:24] Billy Paul there's a real
[2:13:28] man since wind is belching make you a
[2:13:31] man it's just this guy he was just a big
[2:13:34] rough tough guy the next thing you know
[2:13:36] it looked like he and Fletcher
[2:13:40] Bry God was showing him he said oh
[2:13:43] my is this is this what it's going to
[2:13:48] happen to me yeah your wife will leave
[2:13:50] you you think this is what you want and
[2:13:53] he said I've got to go sermon standing
[2:13:55] in a gap i' I he says I got to go and
[2:13:59] get alone with God that I get that
[2:14:00] feeling back because you know what
[2:14:03] pretty soon even pastors go through it
[2:14:05] you go through it well if that's the way
[2:14:08] the people are going to be if that's the
[2:14:09] way my brother if that's the way that
[2:14:11] sister or
[2:14:13] whatever I'm staying out of church ain't
[2:14:16] hurting nobody but you
[2:14:20] huh what if your Mansion is next to

[2:14:26] heaven what are you going to do have a
[2:14:28] bigger
[2:14:33] wall let me tell you we need to get
[2:14:35] along here
[2:14:36] first so that we can get along over
[2:14:39] there
[2:14:42] now
[2:14:44] now watch this in Divine Healing 1954
[2:14:49] four he says they give out hundreds of
[2:14:53] cards or more and the only legitimate
[2:14:55] way you could do it when you got an
[2:14:58] audience like this maybe tonight 3,000
[2:15:00] people or more uh then you you got to
[2:15:05] everybody maybe 2,000 wants to be prayed
[2:15:08] for who's going to be first well now
[2:15:11] especially my type of ministry watch
[2:15:14] this my type of ministry there's just
[2:15:17] going to be so
[2:15:18] many of them get to come but it's
[2:15:23] not by my me laying hands on the person
[2:15:28] it's you accepting the presence of Jesus
[2:15:30] Christ am that's what does the healing
[2:15:34] amen and many times you'll be watching
[2:15:37] in the meetings there's more gets healed
[2:15:40] out in the audience without a prayer
[2:15:42] card what's he doing he's saying hey God
[2:15:46] called me to pray for the sick that's
[2:15:48] part of my Ministry but I want to take
[2:15:51] the bride to a higher
[2:15:53] level watch this many times you're
[2:15:55] watching the me there's more gets healed
[2:15:59] out in the audience without prayer cards
[2:16:02] than there are those who come to the
[2:16:03] platform with prayer cards it's just
[2:16:05] where because you got to have faith to
[2:16:07] work on you got one person here maybe
[2:16:11] with faith where you got maybe two or
[2:16:14] 300 sitting out there with faith yeah
[2:16:18] see and it's been in the meetings I got
[2:16:21] letters from letters from De Moine the
[2:16:24] stomach trouble left all kinds of
[2:16:25] diseases left the people after we were
[2:16:29] gone just a
[2:16:32] Vindication of the presence of the
[2:16:34] resurrected Lord Jesus didn't happen
[2:16:37] right then right they were out there and
[2:16:39] guess what they were healed he sent his
[2:16:40] word and it healed the people he said
[2:16:43] that's how my Ministry is a couple
[2:16:45] people come up here have faith in God
[2:16:47] why now you out here sis yeah you right
[2:16:51] now God's yeah you said you and and the
[2:16:54] one next to you and the one behind you
[2:16:55] and everything like that why faith is
[2:16:57] all over the building what was he doing
[2:17:00] you see he was bringing you back to the
[2:17:03] faith of the Pentecostal fathers getting
[2:17:07] you back to a higher level it's not the
[2:17:09] prayer line it's not the laying on of
[2:17:11] hands it's according to your faith amen
[2:17:15] are you following me nothing wrong with
[2:17:18] those
[2:17:19] things but the Apostle Paul was not
[2:17:22] putting it down he said go higher and
[2:17:25] we'll go there to a place of perfection
[2:17:28] if God will permit
[2:17:38] it it's a revealing of the son of
[2:17:43] man as Moses was given two signs you'll
[2:17:47] be given two signs here in the sermon
[2:17:50] speak to this mountain in San Jose I
[2:17:52] want to show
[2:17:56] you so now anytime that an emergency c
[2:18:00] um arises like that and he had an
[2:18:03] emergency he said I'm sorry I'm late to
[2:18:05] the pulpit anyway I'll pass that up we
[2:18:08] try to talk to them in order to build a
[2:18:10] faith around them just watch the
[2:18:14] greatest part of the testimonies that
[2:18:16] come to me in my meetings is from people
[2:18:19] who are healed right out in the
[2:18:21] meeting there's not many that get to me
[2:18:24] here at the platform for me to pray
[2:18:28] for are you guys seeing that look at my
[2:18:32] Ministry he said those that don't get to
[2:18:36] me up here at the platform look at those
[2:18:38] out there and here's where all the
[2:18:39] testimonies come I love to pray for
[2:18:42] people that's my Ministry but there's
[2:18:45] not too many that I get to personally
[2:18:47] it's the Holy Spirit their faith that
[2:18:50] rises in them out there then they get
[2:18:54] healed are you following it he's showing
[2:18:57] us very plainly after Services my office
[2:19:00] can tell you hundreds of letters pour in
[2:19:02] from places where we've been uh of
[2:19:06] people blind maybe sitting in a meeting
[2:19:09] went home just thinking about it a week
[2:19:11] later receive their sight or walking out
[2:19:13] on the street and something happened and
[2:19:16] uh crippled set in a wheelchair all once
[2:19:18] get up and start running see sometimes
[2:19:21] God cannot answer
[2:19:24] spontaneously yeah how many knows that
[2:19:27] remember Daniel I prayed and I believe
[2:19:29] it was 21 days or something like that
[2:19:31] before the angel could get to him but he
[2:19:33] finally gets around see just leave it
[2:19:35] alone and so many testimonies we could
[2:19:38] tell of hundreds and hundreds of things
[2:19:40] that happened that way am see we do
[2:19:44] not what we call major on Divine Healing
[2:19:48] because Divine Healing is a minor amen
[2:19:52] and you cannot major on a minor you know
[2:19:54] that so the great thing that we're after
[2:19:58] for any Revival is to bring lost souls
[2:20:01] to Christ
[2:20:03] first brother Warren when you go to the
[2:20:08] Philippines yes we want people to be
[2:20:10] healed but you know what when people
[2:20:13] come to Christ because we're trying to
[2:20:14] get the last one so we can get out of
[2:20:17] here
[2:20:18] amen we're not going to get out of here
[2:20:21] until the last one's
[2:20:24] healed comes in until the last one comes
[2:20:28] in so
[2:20:30] repent get things right with God look at
[2:20:34] this he says so the great thing that
[2:20:36] we're here for any Revival is bring lost
[2:20:39] souls to Christ revive the church back
[2:20:41] into a spiritual condition to where it
[2:20:43] should be close communion with God bring
[2:20:48] Fellowship among the churches third and
[2:20:50] fourth pray for the sick that's what I
[2:20:53] right he puts it way back down the
[2:20:55] line hey even Fellowship among
[2:20:59] churches you don't hardly see that much
[2:21:01] anymore right used to have a convention
[2:21:04] and you know what people close their
[2:21:05] church and everybody come over and stuff
[2:21:07] no now no day no way they just don't do
[2:21:11] it my brother my sister our maturity
[2:21:13] should be that I can fellowship with
[2:21:16] anybody and even if you don't see it the
[2:21:18] way that I see it I'm not going to count
[2:21:21] you out because what if the last minute
[2:21:24] God opens their eyes how long does it
[2:21:27] take for they have to get right with God
[2:21:29] Split Second Split Second twinkling of
[2:21:32] an eye let's
[2:21:34] go so hey you know what I don't look to
[2:21:37] others I Look to Christ Amen brother
[2:21:40] renam said let's go to a higher come up
[2:21:43] hither John was told by the Spirit come
[2:21:45] up hither John because I want to show
[2:21:47] you things to come to
[2:21:49] pass understand the
[2:21:55] ministry amen look I'm just going to go
[2:21:57] on here amen it's according to your
[2:22:02] faith you give me a couple minutes
[2:22:05] here stop here for a
[2:22:08] moment when God speaks he
[2:22:12] appears and when God appeared to Abraham
[2:22:14] it caused him to manifest his revelation
[2:22:19] every time God appeared to Abraham he
[2:22:22] pulls another word attribute out of him
[2:22:25] in Genesis 12 God speaks to him to move
[2:22:28] out of his country and his own family he
[2:22:31] moves by faith to seek a city whose
[2:22:33] Builder and maker is God so now he
[2:22:35] starts moving what's he doing he's
[2:22:37] walking by faith is that right God
[2:22:39] Appears to him and he builds an altar
[2:22:42] and an altar is a place where you make a
[2:22:44] sacrifice brother Bram said an altar is
[2:22:46] a type of church so Abraham now Builds
[2:22:50] an altar and he goes to church why God's
[2:22:52] appearing to
[2:22:54] him it was the appearing that caused him
[2:22:56] to do it it'll cause you and every
[2:22:59] believer let me tell you you don't
[2:23:01] belong staying home by yourself you
[2:23:03] belong in a church somewhere having
[2:23:05] fellowship with the saints of God
[2:23:10] Amen the word appear in Hebrew this is
[2:23:15] good is raw r a a raw it means to see to
[2:23:21] discern to experience or to catch the
[2:23:26] vision so when you when God Appears to
[2:23:29] you wow I discern I catch the vision I
[2:23:33] see some my eyes come open what do you
[2:23:36] think that the third pull is it's an eye
[2:23:39] openening
[2:23:40] experience but don't forget there's two
[2:23:43] in the Bible that opens eyes right
[2:23:48] God and the
[2:23:50] devil because didn't Satan say in the
[2:23:54] garden don't you want to be like God
[2:23:56] don't you want your eyes
[2:24:00] open sin is an eye opening
[2:24:04] experience so a false Revelation is just
[2:24:08] as stimulating as a true
[2:24:12] one false wine cheap wine will make you
[2:24:16] just as drunk as good wine right so
[2:24:21] understand we need God God give me true
[2:24:24] Revelation okay amen so appearing is
[2:24:29] when God comes to you he makes you
[2:24:32] understand something and it manifested
[2:24:34] in your life if you say that God has
[2:24:37] been revealing himself to you and you
[2:24:40] remain the same it's no revealing it's
[2:24:44] knowledge and knowledge doesn't change
[2:24:46] you
[2:24:47] right because there are some in the
[2:24:49] Bible that says and they're ever
[2:24:50] learning and never coming to the
[2:24:52] knowledge of the
[2:24:54] truth that's why our kids unless they're
[2:24:57] converted unless they're born again they
[2:24:59] cannot understand the kingdom of God
[2:25:01] period you must be born again every time
[2:25:04] God Appears to his children he's doing
[2:25:07] he's pulling another word attribute out
[2:25:09] of you Abraham God Appears to him pulls
[2:25:12] an attribute next thing he goes to
[2:25:14] church next thing he's having communion
[2:25:16] with God see remember Genesis 18 God
[2:25:19] Appears to him in the plains of memmory
[2:25:22] he has foot washing and communion and he
[2:25:24] pays ties what is it God's appearing to
[2:25:27] him so now he's giving back to God do
[2:25:30] you understand when we come to church
[2:25:32] you know what you come here for God to
[2:25:34] appear to you for God to speak to you
[2:25:37] for God to give you a revelation for you
[2:25:39] to come a little bit higher and go oh
[2:25:41] wow God you were talking to me this
[2:25:43] morning oh my you gave me a direct word
[2:25:47] what was he doing he's bringing a
[2:25:50] manifestation of his virtue out of you
[2:25:54] musics
[2:25:59] come multitudes of God appearing down
[2:26:02] through the scriptures
[2:26:03] multitudes God Appears here God Appears
[2:26:07] there and when he does he's causing
[2:26:11] them to have a manifestation in their
[2:26:15] lives appears in a pillar of fire of
[2:26:19] whirlwinds burning bush small still
[2:26:23] voice and he says there's many appearing
[2:26:26] how many of you know
[2:26:28] that in the sermon convinced and then
[2:26:30] concerned give you a couple more quotes
[2:26:32] and I'll I'll let you
[2:26:34] go there's a great big difference in the
[2:26:36] sign of Jesus appearing and then Jesus
[2:26:42] coming
[2:26:44] 1962 there's two different words means
[2:26:47] two different things the appearing of
[2:26:49] the Lord and the coming of the Lord now
[2:26:52] the appearing of the Lord is now
[2:26:53] somebody say now that's what's happening
[2:26:56] right now the appearing of the Lord the
[2:26:58] appearing of the son of man what's he
[2:27:00] doing he's revealing
[2:27:03] himself when he appearing when he's
[2:27:06] appearing in his people his Spirit
[2:27:08] working among them proving that it's him
[2:27:12] with them getting them ready for the
[2:27:15] Rapture wow
[2:27:17] for the coming of the Lord to catch away
[2:27:19] is bride see the appearing in the coming
[2:27:21] right he's appearing now to get you
[2:27:23] ready so that he can come and catch you
[2:27:25] away hallelujah thank you Lord thank you
[2:27:28] Lord thank you Lord for the
[2:27:32] appearing Time After Time God
[2:27:35] Appears makes himself known to you and
[2:27:39] when he does what he's doing he's
[2:27:40] bringing another attribute of himself
[2:27:42] out of
[2:27:44] [Music]
[2:27:45] you
[2:27:49] how many of you believe we're coming to
[2:27:55] Perfection I've got some quotes on it
[2:27:57] but here I I'll save it for another
[2:28:00] time Jesus said be perfect as your
[2:28:03] father in Heaven is
[2:28:05] perfect he said we're not talking about
[2:28:07] a Perfection here in this physical flesh
[2:28:09] why is because this body that you have
[2:28:13] is a byproduct of sin and God will not
[2:28:16] allow your body this physical body could
[2:28:19] to come into His divine presence so in
[2:28:22] the moment in the twinkling of an eye we
[2:28:25] shall all be
[2:28:28] changed he said God's not going to allow
[2:28:31] this Mortal sinful byproduct of sin to
[2:28:34] come into His
[2:28:36] presence so we're going to drop this and
[2:28:40] then we have another body not made with
[2:28:43] him and he says and we'll catch that the
[2:28:46] off anybody amen huh amen wow you talk
[2:28:51] about an exciting time to be living amen
[2:28:55] we've seen his appearing he's still
[2:28:57] appearing yes he's still revealing he's
[2:29:00] still coming to you he's still speaking
[2:29:02] to you he's still drawing his attributes
[2:29:05] out of you you're becoming more like him
[2:29:08] and if you're not something's
[2:29:11] wrong is that right because if
[2:29:14] Revelation is coming to you greater and
[2:29:17] you are not manifesting that
[2:29:20] Revelation it's
[2:29:22] knowledge and knowledge puffeth
[2:29:25] up just makes you proud and arrogant you
[2:29:28] have a religious spirit if somebody
[2:29:30] don't see it like you do well then you
[2:29:32] cut off
[2:29:33] Fellowship brother Bram said one guy
[2:29:35] said he's coming on a white horse and
[2:29:37] another said he's coming on a white
[2:29:38] cloud he said what difference does it
[2:29:42] make he said as long as we agree he
[2:29:45] coming amen God help us to have that
[2:29:47] mature Faith huh have faith in God
[2:29:53] understand that the greatest thing that
[2:29:55] all of you can have is
[2:29:58] faith faith will move
[2:30:01] mountains faith will speak those things
[2:30:04] that are not as though they are this is
[2:30:08] not the power of positive thinking no
[2:30:12] this is actually things Abraham called
[2:30:15] those things which were not
[2:30:17] as though they
[2:30:23] were God can't change it until you speak
[2:30:27] it you got power with
[2:30:29] [Music]
[2:30:31] God tell your
[2:30:33] children say you know what I got enough
[2:30:36] religion for all of
[2:30:38] us and said you may not feel like you're
[2:30:41] coming right now but you
[2:30:43] will if you have to learn a hard lesson
[2:30:46] you will because Papa God knows how to
[2:30:49] get your
[2:30:52] attention you can run but you can't
[2:30:56] hide
[2:30:58] amen that's why my brother and sister
[2:31:01] even my Ministry I see is
[2:31:04] changing I'm not trying to convince
[2:31:08] everybody

[2:31:22] mind I just feel bad that for some
[2:31:25] reason they didn't catch the revealing
[2:31:27] of the son of man I can't turn away from

[2:31:35] it I

[2:31:41] he's opened my eyes Lord and now I see

[2:32:00] to me I'm nothing I'm just your brother
