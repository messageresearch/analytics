[25:04] verse 24.
[25:06] [Music]
[25:15] and there was also a strive among them
[25:18] which of them should be accounted the
[25:21] greatest
[25:24] and he said unto them
[25:27] the kings of the Gentiles exercise
[25:29] lordship over them and they that
[25:32] exercise Authority upon them are called

[26:28] Christ himself
[26:30] because of the way he lead things in
[26:33] such a simplicity
[26:35] uh we come trembling on the pulpit but
[26:39] he manages to put everything in place
[26:43] by showing ahead of time and
[26:47] by the time so human beings
[26:50] by his grace uh we get we get adjusted
[26:54] to him
[26:55] amen we're going to continue with uh
[27:00] our
[27:02] title we have the end times and the
[27:06] super race this will be part five and
[27:09] the coming of the Lord in of the Lord in
[27:13] Babylon part three
[27:15] uh
[27:16] I hope the Lord will allow us to have
[27:19] enough time tonight to
[27:21] finish this part and to get into the
[27:24] bright part of things
[27:25] but if you want sit a little longer it's
[27:28] up to him
[27:30] to him as uh he leads the way
[27:34] we have been covering this this uh
[27:39] title and things from Genesis and time
[27:44] of nimrod and seeing how
[27:48] all this Kingdom we have around us came
[27:52] about
[27:53] how nimrodha
[27:56] we find him in the Book of Genesis as
[27:59] just
[28:00] a man but
[28:03] born out of a woman and a father
[28:07] but this man was anointed in such a way
[28:11] to have a certain Kingdom of his own
[28:15] over time
[28:18] Nimrod had
[28:21] came about just like your normal guy
[28:24] we received him in our churches in our
[28:27] countries and he told us he's going to
[28:30] make our life better
[28:32] just as he did in the Garden of Eden
[28:35] I'll make a few
[28:37] a god
[28:38] say like you know but you already are
[28:40] with God
[28:41] Pastor Adam said that you know we are
[28:44] God made flesh today
[28:47] but he said no
[28:49] what is this as a brother Adam has
[28:54] preach on this no is he preached on that
[28:56] no okay so I am giving you more
[29:00] revelation
[29:01] because he had a powerful thought in
[29:04] mind but remember I'm saying
[29:06] over time we see that along the church
[29:09] ages
[29:10] telling us
[29:12] these are just normal Believers converts
[29:17] of Messengers along the ages but the way
[29:21] unconverted people
[29:23] and since they were unconverted they
[29:25] came around and bringing their own
[29:27] interpretation of the word after
[29:29] bringing all that in and they Blended
[29:33] State and church together and they
[29:37] became more powerful and that's what we
[29:40] read in the world and we speak of the
[29:43] dominating female
[29:45] when you give power and money to
[29:48] somebody who doesn't who's not converted
[29:53] it's uh just a whole big mess because
[29:57] they have a powerful thought in mind
[29:59] because they want to make or give us a
[30:03] better Kingdom than what Michael had
[30:06] proposed to us
[30:09] but but God's grace as
[30:13] we've been seeing this that this was
[30:15] also taking place among the disciples
[30:18] and these disciples where people were
[30:22] converted brought
[30:23] according to Luke 6
[30:26] Jesus went and prayed all night and came
[30:29] down the mountain and started picking
[30:31] all the disciples this was the Bride of
[30:35] Jesus Christ that Jesus got into
[30:37] courtship with he was showing him
[30:39] showing them the way how to deal with
[30:43] their Ministries how to behave but
[30:46] nevertheless that sin Elijah the Prophet
[30:49] come and go and they were there standing
[30:51] there with the revealed son of man God
[30:55] made flesh again
[30:57] they were standing there and then yet
[30:59] despite of all this great Revelation
[31:01] they had they were standing there and
[31:04] they wanted to become a little bit who's
[31:07] greater Among Us
[31:09] we saw all these things how these things
[31:11] happens among countries and segregation
[31:14] right racism and tribalism and worship
[31:20] of gods and you know all these things
[31:23] from one nation to another all these
[31:26] things that Nimrod has brought about
[31:28] that we start finding that also in the
[31:32] Church of the Living God
[31:34] but they also went uh and brought all
[31:39] kind of systems capitalism Fascism and
[31:43] Nazism uh from Europe and all these
[31:46] things and the word shows us that hey at
[31:49] the end all this will be swallowed up
[31:51] into communism and when you study the
[31:54] word and the Lord has been dealing with
[31:57] me quite a lot probably on those things
[31:59] uh maybe uh at the appointed time
[32:04] to show that communism was getting in
[32:07] taking place and all these things I know
[32:10] when you speak about communism in
[32:12] America not everybody will be happy
[32:15] about it because they don't want it
[32:19] but it's a matter of knowing God's
[32:22] program and when you know God's program
[32:24] you don't have to fight it because
[32:26] brother says yes it's at some stage it's
[32:30] Antichrist but according to the whole
[32:33] program of God that has to be that way
[32:36] we may like it or not because we like
[32:38] our country best because we like the
[32:41] system and we can have all the reasons
[32:45] why we shouldn't have communism but
[32:48] nevertheless it's happening and the more
[32:52] you see on the news what is taking place
[32:55] the bricks and all the revolution in the
[32:58] diverse countries and and stuff and you
[33:01] can just see that well
[33:04] uh the very men who thought that he had
[33:07] a system in place to be able to oppress
[33:11] and to lead the world into a certain
[33:13] kingdom is being just taken by his own
[33:17] trap
[33:18] but nevertheless we'll get to that in
[33:21] the at God's appointed time and things
[33:23] and here now
[33:26] the son of man perceiving what they had
[33:30] what was going on among them and said
[33:32] and he said unto them because there was
[33:35] a strive among them
[33:37] it's not always known when people are
[33:40] striving it's like you know we are we
[33:43] are in this and left and right up and
[33:45] down but then
[33:48] the Lord said no look at me I am among
[33:51] you as a servant the purpose of me
[33:54] living all the throne the praise and
[33:57] everything that I was is to come down to
[34:01] show you how it's supposed to be done
[34:03] and he's showing the Believers a certain
[34:06] path and when he came down he paid a
[34:09] price he nail was nail on the cross
[34:11] according to revelation 12.
[34:16] the dragon looked at the woman with uh
[34:19] with the Sun
[34:21] after the sun was uh was delivered
[34:24] but what I'm saying is like you know
[34:26] this was Jesus Christ when he was born
[34:28] after being born and has done his thing
[34:31] then he was lifted up on the cross he
[34:34] was lifted up on the throne and from
[34:37] Revelation 12 he takes us back in
[34:39] Revelation 1 and Revelation 1 reveals us
[34:43] now this Jesus was ascended on high and
[34:46] set on the cross on the throne now
[34:48] revealing to himself again now to John
[34:51] who was one of the disciples
[34:54] and
[34:56] this bride or this woman that was a
[35:01] head the son over his head and the moon
[35:05] under his feet was taken to the
[35:07] Wilderness and the Wilderness where
[35:09] Branham says it was the United States
[35:12] it says that opens up the church ages he
[35:16] says exactly it says I can prove it to
[35:18] you by the scripture to show you exactly
[35:21] to the date of Plymouth Rock
[35:24] and when he puts it there he says well
[35:28] but then look at what happens because
[35:32] God's program must come to pass because
[35:36] when the bride or the woman of
[35:38] Revelation 12 was going to the
[35:42] wilderness
[35:43] she had to go and be taken care of
[35:47] he says look at that woman when she came
[35:50] to the United States she came for the
[35:53] freedom of worship
[35:55] he said like you know that was the
[35:57] remnant of the woman
[35:59] along the church ages you see every part
[36:03] of the Bride of that Remnant was taken
[36:06] care of until we get to this point here
[36:09] and when she gets to that level then say
[36:13] see now look at what how Jezebel comes
[36:18] behind it
[36:20] as we saw last service then they started
[36:23] building what we call America today from
[36:26] the East the 13 colonies all the way to
[36:29] what we have today and the terminology
[36:31] that we speak here particularly in
[36:34] America of the Wild West because it has
[36:37] to go that way because civilization
[36:41] comes from the East to the west and as
[36:45] he was coming there in the natural it
[36:47] goes the same also in the spiritual also
[36:50] it applies
[36:51] and the Lord after seeing all this now
[36:55] it takes us back in Revelation 14 and in
[36:59] Revelation 14 then we have the Three
[37:01] Angels flying out the first Angel was
[37:05] speaks his message the second angel
[37:07] speaks his message but the third Angel
[37:09] when he comes he also speaks his message
[37:12] but when I'm saying see watch the three
[37:15] walls that follows it and when these
[37:18] three walls start following the third
[37:20] Angel's message then we start seeing
[37:23] that the first war came about
[37:26] the second woke him about but then under
[37:29] after the uh
[37:32] second war is sounded then the angel
[37:35] comes back around they say
[37:37] two woe has passed behold the third
[37:41] world cometh quickly
[37:43] so now when we see these three walls
[37:46] it's connected to the third Angel's
[37:48] message and this third Angel's message
[37:51] is happening
[37:53] exactly at the time that the Angel is
[37:57] coming to call out the people from
[38:00] Babylon
[38:03] and this Babylon is now being given in
[38:07] the type or in a shadow or the image of
[38:11] the Beast before it and we saw last time
[38:14] that the Beast before it was Europe and
[38:17] Europe
[38:18] all the languages all the
[38:22] Techno uh the the the the the learning
[38:25] or all the knowledge came from Europe
[38:27] because Europe took all its Souls from
[38:31] Rome and Rome took it from the Greek the
[38:34] Greek took it from the Egyptian the
[38:37] Egyptians took it from the from Babylon
[38:40] and this Babylon takes us back again as
[38:43] we saw to Nimrod so then we can see the
[38:47] whole bloodline or the whole continuity
[38:50] of the whole thing from the very
[38:52] Inception of it in Genesis all the way
[38:55] as we are standing today in Revelation
[38:58] and now
[39:00] as that we saw last time that now the
[39:03] Lord came down
[39:05] to see what the city that the sons of
[39:09] men have built
[39:12] so when the Lord has to come down the
[39:15] Lord coming down
[39:17] it's not a physical move that human
[39:21] beings we are used to from one step
[39:24] higher to another step but we're going
[39:26] to see tonight by God's grace how the
[39:29] Lord comes down because as we are
[39:31] talking about the coming of the Lord in
[39:34] Babylon
[39:35] because it was important for us first to
[39:38] see where Babylon came from what Babylon
[39:41] does and where Babylon is going
[39:44] but then in between there also we have
[39:46] the third Angel's message because Luther
[39:49] came with the first message uh would
[39:52] John Wesley came with the second message
[39:53] uh justification sanctification but then
[39:58] now this third Angel comes down to take
[40:01] the people out
[40:03] of this Babylon because when we look at
[40:07] Babylon we could have looked at Babylon
[40:09] yesterday as oh some evil Place some
[40:13] place where it's you shouldn't be there
[40:17] but we saw last time that people out
[40:20] there in some poor countries will call
[40:23] they say before you go to heaven come to
[40:26] America
[40:28] because it looks so nice
[40:31] because the media
[40:34] tells them look at what life should look
[40:37] like
[40:38] look at how you should leave
[40:41] look at how you woman you can be free
[40:44] you can do whatever you want just as a
[40:48] last time lasts a few weekends when I
[40:50] was in Mexico showing the brothers like
[40:52] you know
[40:54] this system has brought the people to
[40:57] become independent
[40:59] they do not rely they don't need to
[41:02] depend on the Lord
[41:04] they want to become strong and
[41:07] independent
[41:08] that's why we hear today strong and
[41:11] independent woman
[41:12] but the Lord is now looking for a wife
[41:16] who belongs to him a purge possession
[41:22] she's not free out there doing whatever
[41:25] she wants to do she has also what she
[41:27] has to do because that's what exactly
[41:30] Nimrod did by saying like you know I
[41:32] have the interpretations of the Gods I
[41:36] can tell you how to manipulate I can
[41:38] tell you how to make money
[41:40] see she had made herself rich and has
[41:44] need of Nothing the Same bloodline I'm
[41:49] saying say see give her money she can
[41:53] make her own things and take her to sit
[41:56] back home she'll never do it why because
[41:59] it only requires the Holy Spirit to tell
[42:02] her her position exactly the same way as
[42:06] if did wanting to be in a different
[42:09] position than what she was then today we
[42:13] have all the reasons also that we show
[42:16] why we should be independent and strong
[42:19] a strong Nation a stronger brother a
[42:23] strong
[42:25] teacher who thinks that you know brother
[42:27] Branham has made mistakes left and right
[42:30] all those mindset shows us where it
[42:34] started because at the end of the day
[42:37] Nimrod wanted to be worshiped
[42:40] and worship it's not necessarily the
[42:43] fact of kneeling down but embracing a
[42:47] certain ways of perception of life
[42:51] but then by embracing that perception of
[42:54] life that's the way idolatry comes into
[42:57] place
[42:58] because he said to Israel he said woe
[43:01] unto you who go seek help in Egypt
[43:05] they started worshiping there he says
[43:07] but well I have
[43:10] cherish you I have espoused you
[43:14] I am taking care of you why are you
[43:17] standing there and go look for help
[43:19] somewhere else we see that all over the
[43:21] Bible in the time of Samuel and uh all
[43:24] these times here
[43:25] then the Lord and the Bible says that
[43:27] Genesis verse chapter 11 it says and the
[43:31] whole earth was of one language of one
[43:33] speech and he came to pass as the
[43:35] journey from the East that they found a
[43:37] plane in the land of shinda and they
[43:39] dwell there and they say the one to
[43:42] another Guru go to let us make break and
[43:44] burn them firstly and they had brief for
[43:48] stone slime had uh they murdered and
[43:52] they said go to let us build the city
[43:54] and Tower whose top May reach unto
[43:58] heaven let's Elevate our statue let's
[44:02] become civilized let's be developed let
[44:06] become brighter as we saw last time
[44:08] about how the United States came about
[44:11] verse 5 and the Lord came down
[44:16] to see the city and the tower which the
[44:19] children of men build it
[44:22] because this city had given people the
[44:26] understanding that we don't need God we
[44:30] are a free people a free Nation but yes
[44:34] they came for freedom of religion but
[44:38] then quickly it was the the Beast spoke
[44:43] like a lamb it looked like a lamb but
[44:46] then quickly spoke like the dragon
[44:48] before it and this Dragon says is our
[44:52] American buffalo it looks like a lamb
[44:57] [Music]
[44:59] doesn't really look dangerous but when
[45:02] you get around it you can get into much
[45:04] trouble
[45:06] amen because now this Beast as its
[45:10] building hit they said like you know oh
[45:12] look at this the whole nation now the
[45:15] whole nation when the United States goes
[45:17] everywhere they say like you know we
[45:19] will tell you how to do it we will show
[45:22] you how to do it then the Lord must come
[45:24] down but then how does the Lord come
[45:27] down
[45:28] in the message the mark of the beast
[45:31] and the Seal of God part two paragraph
[45:34] 109 watch the first
[45:36] Angel and the and the Reformation Luther
[45:39] preached the gospel second Angel Wesley
[45:42] Wesley a sanctification before the
[45:45] fornication he straightened up the
[45:47] church but the third message the message
[45:50] the Pentecostal message should be the
[45:53] true message it should be the true
[45:55] Messenger warning them to escape the
[45:58] mock of the Beast saying whosoever
[46:01] receives the mark of the beast the same
[46:04] will drink the wrath of God put out
[46:07] without me without mixture into the cup
[46:10] of of indignation and poured out upon
[46:13] the people that's the very message today
[46:16] the third Angel the third message the
[46:20] last message the Lutheran message of
[46:22] justification the Western message of
[46:24] sanctification and the Pentecostal
[46:27] message of the Seal of God escaped The
[46:30] Mark of the Beast come out of them big
[46:34] walls of Babylon be sealed into the
[46:38] kingdom of God
[46:40] because we saw that Jesus telling the
[46:44] disciples I am pointing you unto a
[46:47] kingdom
[46:48] because the same Jesus had to come down
[46:51] according to Luke 1 the angel had come
[46:55] and spoke to the uh to uh to uh the
[47:00] father of of John the Baptist and said
[47:03] you shall have a son and this son shall
[47:06] do a pod of Malachi 4 when he does that
[47:10] part of taking the further the faith of
[47:13] the fathers to the children then now the
[47:17] scripture stops there then now we have
[47:19] the other part of returning the faith of
[47:23] the the children to the fathers because
[47:26] that the bride or the woman along the
[47:30] time that she was taken care of Into the
[47:32] Wilderness the whole word was all
[47:35] scattered about
[47:37] people had brought all kind of ideas why
[47:40] because Nimrod was able to get into the
[47:43] church got all the money build all these
[47:46] things and have all this everything that
[47:48] he wanted to do so now brother random is
[47:51] showing us that the third angel
[47:53] has to do this in the same message
[47:55] paragraph 30 now this is the third
[47:58] Angel's message to the world and you
[48:01] know what's the total the third age
[48:03] Angel's message is going forth now in
[48:07] this day this is the flying of the third
[48:10] Angel's message if you believe a Bible
[48:13] reader there was three words followed it
[48:18] the first one happened in World War one
[48:21] second one happened in World War II you
[48:25] see
[48:26] what's going in uh what's what we're
[48:28] going in now all right we at the end of
[48:33] the road
[48:35] because of the security that Babylon has
[48:39] given to the people
[48:42] he says that we don't need to go
[48:43] anywhere else
[48:45] this is the place to be
[48:47] and make me enough money I see my
[48:49] doctors left and right but he said like
[48:52] you know no no no no no
[48:53] we at the end of the road
[48:56] that's where you see the place of
[48:58] communism because now since now America
[49:02] doesn't want communism to come
[49:05] it has to be there so that America can
[49:08] impose War upon the system of Communism
[49:11] so that God can bring his word to pass
[49:18] the whole program of God is becoming
[49:21] full is being fulfilled before our
[49:24] wandering eyes
[49:26] we're standing and we're looking and
[49:28] we're seeing
[49:29] oh it's happening then what what is then
[49:33] what is our Escape
[49:36] the Bible says Revelation 14 the third
[49:39] Angel comes in
[49:41] to say like you know here's the door of
[49:44] Escape
[49:45] the same way that Jesus came to the
[49:47] disciples said like you know pray that
[49:50] your fleeing should not be in winter
[49:53] because as you see they all Miss
[49:56] surrounding Jerusalem no the time is at
[49:59] hand
[50:00] so as we are standing Faithfully seeing
[50:04] watching the news
[50:07] many times you will say like you know
[50:09] Vlad me should just leave power and give
[50:12] us peace
[50:14] but to those who have received the third
[50:17] Angels message are being made aware of
[50:21] preparation time for departure because
[50:24] that departure is a secret and certain
[50:27] departure
[50:30] and this departure is only to a
[50:34] qualified group
[50:36] it's not the fact of just coming to
[50:38] church listening to a sermon and all
[50:41] these things because also Nimrod came to
[50:43] church
[50:45] Judas came to church
[50:48] he was given all the money
[50:51] he was in collaboration with all the
[50:53] denominations
[50:55] and by having that a veil was put on him
[50:59] so that he may not see what is going on
[51:03] at times blessings material blessing or
[51:07] financial blessing it's not always a
[51:09] sign that God is with you
[51:13] because of this money these are all the
[51:17] independence we have can put us in a
[51:20] condition that I don't need that today
[51:23] I don't need to a pastor to tell me
[51:25] anything I don't need a husband to tell
[51:28] me anything I don't need a prophet to
[51:30] tell me anything
[51:31] but be also aware of that condition
[51:36] where is it going to put you in amen
[51:39] question and answers
[51:41] you see brother Branham shows us now how
[51:44] now this Angel is coming down how the
[51:48] Lord is coming down because as the Lord
[51:50] is coming down it says in question and
[51:53] answer uh number two uh 1964 paragraph
[51:57] 114. now we say this with reserve and
[52:01] love and respect see as Jesus Christ the
[52:04] same yesterday today and forever and
[52:06] also that in the last days as it was
[52:09] before lost time or in lost time in
[52:12] Sodom so shall it be in the day that the
[52:16] Son of Man reveals himself again
[52:19] revealing himself no in these last days
[52:23] the logos that was Upon Jesus Upon Jesus
[52:28] which he has become from the back of the
[52:33] pillow fire again
[52:35] and has descended down on Earth
[52:39] he says I was going to say something but
[52:43] I watched the tape they wouldn't believe
[52:46] that in if I told them
[52:49] it wouldn't make any difference people
[52:52] wouldn't believe it but I'll omit that
[52:55] but has come down for like in investing
[53:00] judgment goes on
[53:04] the angel
[53:06] the time that people are sitting
[53:09] the Lord in Genesis 11 we see he's
[53:12] coming down to see what city that the
[53:16] sons of man have built
[53:19] and here now the same pillow fire now is
[53:22] coming down again
[53:24] for an investigation judgment
[53:27] because God does not bring somebody to
[53:32] judgment without first warning him
[53:36] so the angel has to come down the third
[53:40] Angel has to come down the pillow fire
[53:42] has to come down it's coming down to do
[53:45] an investigation
[53:48] because if we have a if a situation
[53:50] rises in the land we send the FBI the
[53:55] FBI comes down for investigation
[53:59] then after the investigation is done
[54:02] it's given to the court
[54:05] the quotes now will pronounce the
[54:07] judgment
[54:09] because that God has to warn you first
[54:14] you've been doing this you've been doing
[54:16] this and leaving all this kind of Life
[54:18] who you've been having all this your own
[54:20] interpretation of the word but you say
[54:22] he has to come down
[54:25] paragraph 116 then watch The Works of it
[54:29] Among Us proves the same Jesus does once
[54:33] live in Palestine The Same Spirit was
[54:36] upon him as come through a body
[54:40] until it's come back to headship again
[54:43] which is is coming soon to claim the
[54:47] body amen the heads coming to the body
[54:51] you get it
[54:52] that will be the Son of God the son of
[54:56] man the son of the son of David the I am
[54:59] the rose of Sharon the lily of the
[55:02] valley the Morning Star
[55:04] I am not he
[55:07] I am his servant and the pillow fire is
[55:11] not he
[55:14] it's he it's in spirit form see which
[55:18] was upon the son of man has come now to
[55:22] anoint sons of men
[55:25] to bring back a Ministry just exactly
[55:30] like he said he would be in order for
[55:34] the head and the rest of the body to
[55:37] connect together
[55:40] at the same time of Investigation
[55:42] judgment
[55:44] it is some time that the son of man is
[55:46] building all these great things and all
[55:51] that the the the trumpers and all the
[55:54] the weapons and they can go from one uh
[55:59] side of the world to another in just a
[56:01] matter of seconds
[56:04] in that time is also coming down to also
[56:08] do
[56:09] certain things
[56:12] this pillow fire this great spirit but
[56:15] random says obey the angel the voice of
[56:17] the Angel paragraph
[56:21] 1950 and John and then John the reveler
[56:26] the whole book of Revelation when it was
[56:28] wrote he said I have sent my angel Jesus
[56:32] did and John fell down to worship the
[56:36] angel but the angel said stand up
[56:39] worship God see through angel of God
[56:43] won't stand to be worshiped
[56:45] and he said that he was or he was of the
[56:49] prophets and was his fellow man that had
[56:53] been sent to signify these things
[56:58] John
[57:00] he's standing there he's looking and
[57:02] he's watching what time because John
[57:05] he's looking and seeing what is taking
[57:08] place
[57:09] he's seeing the country or the land that
[57:13] the sons of men have built at that same
[57:16] time God now Jesus sends his Angel and
[57:21] his angel now when the angel now stop
[57:23] talking to John John the bride and not
[57:26] the son of Zebedee but he's looking and
[57:30] he's saying this is such a great mystery
[57:34] I could have I known
[57:36] I could have I knew
[57:38] how to deal with this element here then
[57:42] John wanted to worship
[57:46] remember what we saw how Nimrod came
[57:51] about and brought Worship in the church
[57:55] having all this idol worship
[57:58] that's why even today that many people
[58:01] are even afraid to say that I am in the
[58:04] message of the hour because some people
[58:06] think that people in the message of the
[58:09] hour who worship brother Branham
[58:13] some if they see you even with the pitch
[58:16] of brother Branham they are afraid they
[58:18] think of you as a worshiper of brother
[58:20] Branham
[58:22] why because Jonah the bride was about to
[58:27] worship
[58:30] he was about to worship then the angel
[58:33] told him no
[58:35] I am a man
[58:37] saved by grace
[58:40] despite the ministry that God has
[58:43] allotted to me the reason why you see
[58:46] all this ministry it's because I have
[58:49] healed myself to him that's right the
[58:52] fact I've healed myself to him I am also
[58:55] showing you how to heal yourself to him
[58:59] that's why this ministry comes down also
[59:03] to have sons of men so to reconnect that
[59:07] Fellowship that relationship between the
[59:10] head and the rest of the body
[59:12] and all these things is taking place
[59:15] right down there in Babylon
[59:21] it's not taking place in the skies it's
[59:23] not taking place in a secluded area no
[59:26] as Jeremiah told them he said go out
[59:29] there get married do all these things
[59:32] here lest you be consumed you'll be
[59:35] terminated
[59:36] but at the same time you know that
[59:39] according to the prophecy the time is at
[59:42] hand
[59:44] according to the voice of Malachi 4 that
[59:48] this is the way of escape the Lord is
[59:50] coming down as it says that you know no
[59:53] I am one of the prophets worship God
[59:55] therefore
[59:58] Angelic beings is ordained ministers of
[1:00:01] God to come to the Earth to Bear record
[1:00:05] of God and they work through moral
[1:00:08] beings it just as they did through
[1:00:11] Daniel and back through the ages there
[1:00:13] and I believe it with all my heart
[1:00:18] the time in which there we are living in
[1:00:21] this investigation judgment
[1:00:23] it's also bringing a fellowship
[1:00:27] a communication
[1:00:29] a delivery precisely for the ministry of
[1:00:34] Sons of men
[1:00:37] because each son of man
[1:00:41] not the son of man but a son of man each
[1:00:45] of our Ministries
[1:00:47] is being attended to by Angelic beings
[1:00:53] these Angelic beings are called our
[1:00:57] theophanese because when we hear from
[1:01:00] our theophanese we are being realigned
[1:01:03] to be able to receive that uninterrupted
[1:01:07] communication that's why broadbandam
[1:01:10] says the voice of God in these last days
[1:01:13] in the days that the media wants to
[1:01:16] speak to your soul
[1:01:18] they want to pervert you they want to
[1:01:21] make you strong and dependent but now
[1:01:24] also the communication is also happening
[1:01:28] and only these communications only given
[1:01:31] to a qualified group and this qualified
[1:01:34] group is only those who are ready to
[1:01:37] surrender
[1:01:40] because the wave sheath has he was
[1:01:43] receiving these communications he
[1:01:45] thought that it was him
[1:01:48] he's not like you know he was his
[1:01:49] ability to do things then the angel came
[1:01:52] and said do you think that you're the
[1:01:54] one that makes all to see those visions
[1:01:57] do you think that you're the one that
[1:01:58] makes all these sermons
[1:02:01] to bring him to be away
[1:02:05] of how immaterial and yet material that
[1:02:10] communication is how that presence is
[1:02:15] when it became aware of it it says the
[1:02:18] reason why I have you always come to the
[1:02:20] right it's because I know he's here
[1:02:24] you say sister you see you know why I'm
[1:02:27] waiting I'm basically waiting for him to
[1:02:30] come
[1:02:31] and when he gets in but the voice is
[1:02:33] still the same when you listen to the
[1:02:35] tape you say did you hear that
[1:02:37] that was not me but that was him
[1:02:41] but look how immaterial we thought like
[1:02:44] you know the the Lord coming down we
[1:02:47] will see the sky opening up and the
[1:02:49] angel blowing trumpets and all these
[1:02:51] things here
[1:02:52] but in that Simplicity this is what
[1:02:55] we're going to see next and it says so
[1:02:58] therefore paragraph 13 but God's gift is
[1:03:01] the spirit of God that came down in the
[1:03:04] form of an Angel
[1:03:08] the spirit of God
[1:03:10] coming taking a form a form of an
[1:03:14] Angelic being
[1:03:16] I was in need
[1:03:18] then somebody shows up how did you know
[1:03:21] that I needed this help I don't know I
[1:03:22] just felt that I had to come
[1:03:26] sorry material but I just had to obey
[1:03:30] and that obedience
[1:03:33] made then people become odd how do you
[1:03:37] believe how can you be this way look
[1:03:40] look at the woman today how can you
[1:03:43] dress this way you know you have the
[1:03:45] freedom this is a land of the Brave and
[1:03:48] and you can just do whatever you want
[1:03:52] but only the qualified group could be
[1:03:55] able to understand that communication
[1:03:59] no he didn't have any he didn't have
[1:04:02] wings it looked like a man
[1:04:04] I heard him he walked brother Branham
[1:04:07] illustrate
[1:04:09] just as dead and walked on the floor
[1:04:12] walked right over as normal as any man
[1:04:18] many times we're looking for him so far
[1:04:22] am says look next to you
[1:04:25] I know his mistakes I know what he's
[1:04:28] done yesterday I know what is this here
[1:04:32] but he is the one in simplicity
[1:04:36] because perfect weakness brings perfect
[1:04:40] strength now that strength is not the
[1:04:44] one that you know you sleep with you
[1:04:45] wake up with you know the night and day
[1:04:48] how he was born and what mistakes he
[1:04:50] does but the perfect one comes down and
[1:04:55] he uses a vessel with his mistakes and
[1:04:58] aligning that vessel to himself
[1:05:02] because the statue of a perfect man is
[1:05:05] not according to Human idology
[1:05:09] oh but you heard it thinking the other
[1:05:10] day oh but you were speeding oh but you
[1:05:13] haven't paid your taxes or you haven't
[1:05:15] paid your tithes yes he didn't
[1:05:19] yet
[1:05:21] the ministry Angelic beings have come
[1:05:26] down for him
[1:05:29] you might not like it you might debate
[1:05:32] about it but it is so
[1:05:36] you may not like it like you know how
[1:05:38] come you know he made a mistake here and
[1:05:41] how come can he be the prophet of the
[1:05:43] age and now calling the first holster to
[1:05:45] be to be Jesus yes it is true
[1:05:50] nevertheless
[1:05:51] the ministry is to him
[1:05:56] you can have all the reasons in the
[1:05:59] world
[1:06:00] of why not it shouldn't be that's true
[1:06:04] nevertheless God said I have chosen him
[1:06:09] he he him
[1:06:11] is the one he's the one that is the
[1:06:14] worship of the age
[1:06:16] therefore it brings to our mind to
[1:06:19] understand despite of all that I am
[1:06:22] you can sit there in your room you know
[1:06:26] that Lord I know this about me I know
[1:06:28] this about Thee I know this about me but
[1:06:30] he says it's not about you but it's
[1:06:33] about the work that I have done
[1:06:36] and this work that he has done it's not
[1:06:39] according to your mind you might not
[1:06:42] understand everything you might not see
[1:06:44] everything even when you die you might
[1:06:47] even go with questions about certain
[1:06:49] things but nevertheless he has chosen
[1:06:52] you
[1:06:53] by him choosing you it's not about like
[1:06:56] then Jesus says like you know don't
[1:06:58] count yourself to be the greatest
[1:07:04] is looking at his bride he said I know
[1:07:08] that weakness
[1:07:09] Paul said I prayed three times Lord
[1:07:12] deliver me deliver me he said no my
[1:07:15] grace is sufficient unto you
[1:07:19] but does that mean that we know we
[1:07:21] should go and do whatever we want to do
[1:07:22] no
[1:07:26] the angel coming down whatever I'm
[1:07:28] saying it looked like any one of us like
[1:07:31] any man he said like you know well he
[1:07:33] didn't have beard and he did long hair
[1:07:36] at times we'll we will mistaken him just
[1:07:41] like you know maybe some
[1:07:44] buddy yo there's some homeless person
[1:07:46] because he just looked like any man
[1:07:50] hmm
[1:07:51] he says
[1:07:53] the healing of Jairus and the healing of
[1:07:56] Jairus daughter I was baptizing them
[1:07:59] at the spring of the down there in
[1:08:01] progress 86 to to save us time it says
[1:08:04] the career General uh how go away it's
[1:08:07] highlighted
[1:08:08] Mystic light appears Overlook about this
[1:08:11] uh evangelists were baptizing at the
[1:08:13] river very Mystic thing people could not
[1:08:15] understand
[1:08:17] manifested at the presence of it it was
[1:08:20] the angel of the Lord come right down
[1:08:23] and hung over where I was
[1:08:26] amen that we know
[1:08:30] that some of us who are older is
[1:08:33] probably made
[1:08:35] have hunted with
[1:08:37] nevertheless the angel of the Lord came
[1:08:41] down
[1:08:42] to deal with him
[1:08:44] then notice one through life paragraph
[1:08:47] 87 then notice one done through life it
[1:08:51] kept appearing
[1:08:54] one day under the appearing of this
[1:08:57] light
[1:08:58] came forth an angel that told me I was
[1:09:02] to pray for the sick people
[1:09:05] your very life what is the angel doing
[1:09:08] bringing this communication and instead
[1:09:11] now revealing to him
[1:09:13] what is the purpose of his life
[1:09:18] because he's been hearing with this
[1:09:20] voice
[1:09:22] don't do that
[1:09:24] don't defile your body don't do this
[1:09:26] here
[1:09:28] what is this voice
[1:09:30] why can't I just be like the rest of the
[1:09:31] people
[1:09:33] you understand that so it is the same
[1:09:35] with any one of us
[1:09:37] whatever voice that you hear whatever
[1:09:39] feeling you have it's not just like
[1:09:42] human capacity to think
[1:09:44] because at the same time you can look on
[1:09:46] the side and see that somebody else is
[1:09:48] doing exactly what you who are not told
[1:09:50] to do
[1:09:54] why because this light this Spirit
[1:09:58] coming into the form of a light and now
[1:10:01] from the light now is revealing himself
[1:10:03] even more
[1:10:06] uh in the
[1:10:09] in the uh Ephesian Church age I didn't
[1:10:11] give it to you Brothers I'll just uh
[1:10:13] quote it this year you see Paul knew the
[1:10:16] first revelation was correct God did God
[1:10:18] can give a first revelation then a
[1:10:20] second Revelation if he did he would be
[1:10:23] changing his mind he can give a
[1:10:26] revelation then add to it
[1:10:30] what is he doing from the pillow fire
[1:10:34] is coming down
[1:10:37] from the the angel of the light now we
[1:10:40] have Angel as a man
[1:10:43] he gave that the pillow fire that was
[1:10:46] Upon Jesus
[1:10:48] will come back again
[1:10:50] to deal with sons of men to connect the
[1:10:53] head with the body and from the body now
[1:10:56] he is showing us how is he doing it
[1:11:01] is giving a light and from this light
[1:11:05] now in the in the in the cabin now this
[1:11:09] is in the cave sorry then now a man
[1:11:13] comes forth
[1:11:14] and now when the man comes forth he
[1:11:17] tells him hey
[1:11:18] you are called to pray for the sick
[1:11:21] he has heard this
[1:11:23] as a whirlwind
[1:11:26] he was scared he's like you know what is
[1:11:28] this what kind of experience is this
[1:11:30] what's going on but then when he said
[1:11:32] fear not he said yes I knew right away
[1:11:37] yes I knew right away then you conscious
[1:11:40] they say like oh I was praying about
[1:11:42] this and I felt to this this I think
[1:11:44] then the brother comes around and tells
[1:11:46] you something it's like exactly what did
[1:11:49] the Lord just spoke to me there
[1:11:50] yesterday there then you know that this
[1:11:54] is the same pattern that the angel of
[1:11:57] the Lord is coming nearer and narrower
[1:12:00] to you
[1:12:03] he says that he's he's going and to
[1:12:06] enter it as it did as he did in the
[1:12:08] Garden of Eden when he promised the seed
[1:12:11] of the seed to the woman and then let it
[1:12:14] designated that seed had to come through
[1:12:17] Abraham
[1:12:18] and then letter said he will come by the
[1:12:21] same blood in the in the same blood line
[1:12:23] in David but it was the same revelation
[1:12:28] it only gave people more information to
[1:12:33] help them receive and understand it
[1:12:38] what we are listening to
[1:12:40] this communication in the midst of
[1:12:44] Babylon the Lord is coming down for an
[1:12:47] investigation judgment
[1:12:49] and yet at the same time now there's a
[1:12:51] way of Escape but how does it bring us
[1:12:54] to escape by bringing Now The Same
[1:12:58] Spirit in the form of the pillow fire in
[1:13:01] the form of an Angel
[1:13:03] now stop communicating with you what is
[1:13:07] the purpose of your life
[1:13:09] what is the purpose of his life well now
[1:13:13] it goes on he says well this has been
[1:13:16] happening he says well to pray for the
[1:13:18] sick people I told him I couldn't do it
[1:13:21] just as we always do
[1:13:23] brother can you help with this I can do
[1:13:25] it brother can you show up here I can do
[1:13:27] it you know only excuses in the world I
[1:13:30] can't I can't I can't I can't
[1:13:32] there's nothing new Under the Sun
[1:13:37] that's why when you deal with the church
[1:13:39] we love the church as it is
[1:13:46] because even brother Branham himself one
[1:13:48] is like you know this rickian ricketters
[1:13:50] is like no
[1:13:52] among them they are my children
[1:13:55] he knows God himself knows how he has
[1:13:57] planted the seed and Whey has planted
[1:14:00] the seed he didn't plant the seed out
[1:14:03] there in a very nice garden and all this
[1:14:05] no implanted them a day in Babylon he
[1:14:09] said like you know I shall come at the
[1:14:11] appointed time because the ministers
[1:14:13] wanted to pluck up everything
[1:14:16] they wanted like you know you did this
[1:14:18] leave the church you did this don't come
[1:14:20] to me anymore you said no no no no no no
[1:14:22] leave them grow
[1:14:25] let them grow but The Minister's
[1:14:28] responsibility is not to come and
[1:14:31] Peter you love me feed my sheep
[1:14:35] feed my sheep at the appointed time
[1:14:38] they shall hear it because the worship
[1:14:41] of the hour went through the same
[1:14:43] process the man looked at it and said
[1:14:45] like you know oh I wanted to be a ranger
[1:14:47] out there
[1:14:49] I wanted to be a ranger I wanted to be
[1:14:51] this excuse me
[1:14:53] but
[1:14:55] because he was seed because you were
[1:14:59] seed then it takes you and leads your
[1:15:03] life you might not like it but then you
[1:15:06] might you'll find that that he is his
[1:15:09] purpose is stronger than you put your
[1:15:11] personal will
[1:15:15] I want to be in the military but the
[1:15:17] Lord said like no that's not your place
[1:15:18] Billy
[1:15:20] your place is here next to me
[1:15:24] nevertheless I'm going there you go
[1:15:27] there you just speak no you can't you
[1:15:28] can we can take you
[1:15:31] but you able to withstand to stand in
[1:15:34] the presence of the Angel of the Lord
[1:15:36] night and day Billy go give the star the
[1:15:39] cause the angel is right there
[1:15:42] and he knows it to this day he said I
[1:15:44] know exactly when the the presence is
[1:15:46] there I know it but he can stand that
[1:15:49] the bullets in the army
[1:15:51] why because God had built him for a
[1:15:55] specific purpose God has built us for a
[1:15:59] specific work
[1:16:02] we might love what we love left and
[1:16:05] right but remember you need to learn to
[1:16:08] surrender
[1:16:11] learn to surrender because William
[1:16:13] Burnham says oh I should have known if I
[1:16:16] could if I had known
[1:16:19] my first 20 years I would have given it
[1:16:22] to him
[1:16:23] why because it's been aligned now with
[1:16:27] God's program in that program now is
[1:16:29] able now to see like you know I need
[1:16:32] this I need to I have to be displaced
[1:16:34] here it's like you know wherever I go
[1:16:35] when I go to Germany in Africa and when
[1:16:38] these sources are they want to uh to
[1:16:40] attack me and do all these things here
[1:16:41] you say like you know when the Lord
[1:16:43] sends you it doesn't make you offer
[1:16:46] running material
[1:16:48] it puts you in a position that despite
[1:16:52] of the challenges and everything he said
[1:16:55] like you know it's not my job it best is
[1:16:57] work he's the one to come and do it now
[1:17:00] each one of us now have to have the same
[1:17:03] confidence in whatever we do
[1:17:04] [Applause]
[1:17:06] let let you be an accountant and
[1:17:08] engineer whatever you have to be you
[1:17:11] must have that same Commission
[1:17:15] you are called to pray for the people
[1:17:18] I am called to be a housewife I am
[1:17:21] called to be a mother I am called to be
[1:17:23] a minister each one of us according to
[1:17:26] the parent we need to know how to get
[1:17:29] closer to him and the more we get closer
[1:17:32] to him the more glorious the ministry is
[1:17:35] and the more then you have success then
[1:17:38] you look then people come to you how did
[1:17:40] you do it
[1:17:43] how did you prepare it it's like I don't
[1:17:46] know I just came up there and I just
[1:17:47] touched it and it just happened why
[1:17:50] because the angel of the Lord receives
[1:17:53] you in that position
[1:17:55] sees you in the place and he wants you
[1:17:58] to stay in that place
[1:18:01] but then when you start embracing out
[1:18:03] ideas strong independent woman then now
[1:18:07] see the trouble but Abraham says see
[1:18:10] when Jesus left Lazarus house look at
[1:18:12] trouble set in
[1:18:17] amen I'm not even halfway
[1:18:20] but God's grace but we'll uh we'll get
[1:18:22] there I knew that
[1:18:24] but God's grace will get there it's
[1:18:26] almost time but
[1:18:29] God revealing himself to his people
[1:18:32] and I looked and I seen I seen his feet
[1:18:35] and when it got to me he was a tall man
[1:18:39] he was a heavy said weighed about 200
[1:18:41] pounds look like just as natural as I'm
[1:18:45] standing here he had his arm folded like
[1:18:47] that like this first time I ever seen
[1:18:50] him in that form
[1:18:52] he walked right up there I was there he
[1:18:55] looked down he had a smooth face he's
[1:18:58] giving out details about uh about about
[1:19:00] the men the the expression he was a
[1:19:03] sympathetic kind-hearted
[1:19:05] he said fear not experiences but he says
[1:19:10] I said there was a light came in the
[1:19:13] room that little hold the Huddle there
[1:19:16] there was as it was or it was a no flaw
[1:19:20] in it it didn't have a window and he's
[1:19:23] also telling here the experience and
[1:19:25] stuff how when he was born I said since
[1:19:28] that time
[1:19:31] from his birth
[1:19:35] you understand that understand that the
[1:19:37] pattern here is not tied to one man I
[1:19:40] read you the quotation sons of men being
[1:19:43] reconnected to the Head
[1:19:45] he says now from that time what time
[1:19:48] from his birth
[1:19:54] he said he said he since that time it's
[1:19:57] been with me it's an angel of God
[1:20:00] he met me in person a few years ago
[1:20:05] from our birth
[1:20:07] but remember to say you say you say you
[1:20:11] see Moses uh Moses movie about the the
[1:20:14] the the the pillow fire the cloud he
[1:20:16] said you see those leaks of fire you say
[1:20:18] like you know that how it is with every
[1:20:21] believer
[1:20:23] each one of us
[1:20:25] with our leak of Fire
[1:20:28] in our little Ministry
[1:20:31] known or unknown but none of the angel
[1:20:35] Angelic beings sent to minister to the
[1:20:40] sons of God
[1:20:41] at the time of the investigation
[1:20:43] judgment investigating what nimrod with
[1:20:47] everything that he has done how he's
[1:20:49] able now to change men into women
[1:20:52] all these things here is coming to
[1:20:54] investigate and at the same time is also
[1:20:57] showing the same thing
[1:21:03] the ministry Moses Ministry uh Souls
[1:21:06] that are not that are in prison now the
[1:21:09] ones out from under the blood they die
[1:21:12] without Mercy that is a Babylon
[1:21:15] that was Moses let's pull first a young
[1:21:18] man talking to Israel second went down
[1:21:21] to deliver them and third was the last
[1:21:24] message the Miracles had been done Moses
[1:21:28] was on his road to the promised land
[1:21:30] with the redeemed
[1:21:33] oh God be merciful I pray in Jesus name
[1:21:38] the bride the people the so this wave
[1:21:42] chief coming into the land doing all
[1:21:46] this work why because he was able to
[1:21:49] realign himself because Moses down there
[1:21:52] in Egypt he was just thinking like you
[1:21:54] know I'm the just the next Pharaoh in
[1:21:55] the throne they probably want to become
[1:21:57] a pharaoh that's when I'll be able to to
[1:22:00] change all the laws in the land then
[1:22:02] I'll be able to free the people but God
[1:22:04] said not your ways but my ways and his
[1:22:09] ways led him to kill an Egyptian and to
[1:22:11] become a murderer look for in Egypt then
[1:22:14] he couldn't be there then he had to meet
[1:22:17] the pillar of Fire
[1:22:18] you will see the pattern the same pillow
[1:22:21] fire giving us life story Exodus one to
[1:22:23] three is the same pillow Fire coming
[1:22:26] down giving us life story today and the
[1:22:29] same pillow fire bought a coming at your
[1:22:32] birth bringing you as a young man for
[1:22:35] you determining your ministry and to
[1:22:39] bring the redeem to the promised land
[1:22:43] because when you get the pattern on how
[1:22:46] God deals with the prophet he says like
[1:22:48] you know as I've dealt with him so shall
[1:22:51] I do with you
[1:22:52] because the principle of God is to do it
[1:22:56] today being the same yesterday today and
[1:22:58] forever and if it's the same today is
[1:23:00] still doing the same thing and as he's
[1:23:03] still coming and doing the same thing
[1:23:04] then we are aware of what kind of people
[1:23:07] we are
[1:23:09] we are not part of Babylon
[1:23:13] we are not part of the Democrats we are
[1:23:16] not part of the Republicans
[1:23:18] they can do all that they want but we
[1:23:21] have to know that this communication
[1:23:24] that we are receiving from this Angelic
[1:23:26] being is to take us out
[1:23:29] because that that's the only Escape that
[1:23:32] we have and if we don't have this Escape
[1:23:35] then they died there without Mercy
[1:23:39] because behold the third world cometh
[1:23:43] quickly may God bless you
[1:23:53] praise the Lord are you glad you've been
[1:23:56] called out of Babylon amen let's all
