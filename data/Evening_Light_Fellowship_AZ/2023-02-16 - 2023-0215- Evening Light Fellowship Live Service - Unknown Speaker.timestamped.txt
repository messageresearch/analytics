[21:42] thank you musicians
[21:45] you know I kind of
[21:47] questioning myself are you thinking the
[21:50] musicians each and every single time you
[21:52] go to the pulpit sometimes you forget
[21:53] and it's not good
[21:55] they're doing a wonderful job you know
[21:57] they need to be uh
[21:58] yeah to thank them and
[22:01] recognize what they are doing
[22:04] shall we
[22:06] read some scriptures
[22:08] in Psalms
[22:10] chapter 34 Verse
[22:13] seven
[22:23] the angel of the Lord encompassed around
[22:25] about them that fear Him
[22:28] and delivereth them
[22:31] shall we read
[22:32] Psalm 91
[22:37] it's a lengthy reading but uh preferred
[22:40] to start with verse 9. Psalm 91
[22:43] verse 9 to
[22:45] verse 12.
[22:50] because thou has made the Lord which is
[22:53] my refuge even the most high thy
[22:56] habitation
[22:57] they shall know evil before thee neither
[23:01] shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
[23:04] for he shall give his angels charge over
[23:07] thee to keep thee in all thy ways
[23:11] they shall bear thee up in their hands
[23:14] lest thou Dash thy food against the
[23:17] stone
[23:19] we have more to read but for now you can
[23:22] have your seat as God is blessing in the
[23:25] reading of his word
[23:30] I kind of fell to
[23:32] go in the same direction I've been going
[23:34] talking about angels in the ministry of
[23:36] angels
[23:39] because we still have some other things
[23:41] to talk about seems like the nail was
[23:43] not seems to we need to cinch it and
[23:46] make it uh hold tight
[23:51] the uh someone tonight so uh the summons
[23:55] uh title tonight is uh Angelic realm and
[23:59] the ministry of angels part two and for
[24:01] the subject I take can you hear your
[24:04] theophany calling
[24:07] you pray for me and you pull is on
[24:10] and be administering
[24:13] the message that we have received you
[24:15] and I
[24:16] is All About Angels
[24:19] from there constellation of the stars in
[24:23] the sky three of them lining up to the
[24:26] birth of the messenger of this hour
[24:28] William Branham is All About Angels
[24:32] those three stars that lined up in
[24:35] constellation in a constellation it
[24:38] seems like I was Jesus being born again
[24:40] but this is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[24:43] that was about to take place on the
[24:45] Earth
[24:46] because remember
[24:49] the Capstone
[24:51] to cap off the pyramid
[25:00] is Jesus Christ himself because if you
[25:02] see this Cloud that has come in 1963
[25:06] it's seven angels that have formed the
[25:08] pyramid itself
[25:11] so that Capstone
[25:13] head to feet it has to have
[25:16] a part that will fit exactly
[25:19] so that's the ministry of Jesus Christ
[25:21] that's supposed to be there to feed the
[25:23] Capstone
[25:24] that's why the minutes of Jesus of
[25:26] William Branham has to be exactly the
[25:28] ministry of Jesus Christ no wonder
[25:30] people consider him as Jesus himself
[25:33] some of them are worshiping him as a god
[25:40] so that the uh the light on the crib of
[25:43] the
[25:44] newborn
[25:46] was the same light
[25:49] that led the children of Israel from
[25:51] Egypt unto the Palestine
[25:54] 1916.
[25:57] when he was seven years old
[26:00] parking the water from the the well
[26:02] on his way going back home
[26:05] he heard a voice he saw Whirlwind around
[26:08] the tree a voice came out
[26:11] came out of the Whirlwind and talking to
[26:13] him
[26:14] do not defy your body
[26:16] do not smoke or drink because I have a
[26:19] job to do with you when you get older
[26:23] 1933 while baptizing the 17th person in
[26:27] the Ohio River
[26:31] a light came up again in the sky
[26:34] The Voice came out of that light and
[26:35] telling him as the John the Baptist
[26:38] foreign the first coming of Jesus Christ
[26:40] you have a Ministry that will run the
[26:42] second coming of Jesus Christ
[26:45] 1946
[26:49] we can talk even about 1950 in Texas
[26:51] Houston
[26:53] while he was preaching they took a
[26:55] picture of that pillow fire that was
[26:57] hanging above him
[27:00] brothers and sisters we are serving a
[27:03] living God
[27:04] it's not in historical God but he's a
[27:06] living God
[27:07] we are in the Bible here
[27:09] in in a new testament
[27:12] our fathers when they were in the upper
[27:15] room after they prayed
[27:16] the same purify came down
[27:21] and subdivised it
[27:23] hangover each and every one of them
[27:26] exactly like William Branham
[27:28] the fire was on All Above him
[27:32] and God even allowed the picture to be
[27:35] taken because he knew the age we are
[27:37] living in this is a scientific age
[27:39] this is the age of imagination he knew
[27:42] people would be looking they'll be able
[27:44] to look and see the symbol of fire
[27:46] that's the form that God took when he
[27:48] started to create Heaven and the Earth
[27:53] 1946
[27:56] while he was praying for his ministry in
[27:58] the cave
[27:59] because he had a burden about his
[28:01] ministry
[28:02] this life this light in his life this
[28:05] Angel following him all along his life
[28:08] when he was telling people about their
[28:11] lives and visions and things
[28:13] religious people they start talking
[28:14] about it in a bad way they said this is
[28:17] of the devil
[28:19] he was
[28:21] hesitant he didn't know what to do but
[28:23] he did the right thing to go talk to the
[28:25] Creator in heaven himself
[28:27] amen he went to the cave and started
[28:29] talking to God as he was praying he said
[28:32] the light came in the room
[28:35] and then here I want to say something
[28:36] because 1946 that's the same year where
[28:40] Israel was rushed into his homeland
[28:43] there's something to talk about here
[28:47] and the brother bottom says the same
[28:49] meal the same month in June the angel of
[28:51] the Lord came to him in the cave why
[28:54] because we are in the Book of Ruth where
[28:57] Naomi was going back to her Homeland
[28:59] her two daughters have lost their their
[29:02] husbands
[29:03] which were her sons and hell she lost
[29:06] her her husband too and More in moabite
[29:10] so as she was going back she told her
[29:12] daughters-in-law I don't have any sons I
[29:15] don't have sons I don't have any husband
[29:16] you need to stay to your Homeland
[29:21] she kind of backslided and she stayed
[29:25] but Ruth decided to go with Naomi
[29:29] she said I'll go for you your God will
[29:32] be my God your land will be my land
[29:35] so what does that mean
[29:36] it means that at the same time
[29:39] Israel which is the type of Naomi going
[29:42] back to the Homeland
[29:43] this is this is Ruth which we are
[29:46] Gentile we're going back Naomi to be
[29:50] Redeemed by the kingsman Redeemer and
[29:53] asked to be married to the same boss
[29:54] which is our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:00] in 1963
[30:03] finally the cloud was formed as those
[30:06] seven angels formed the cloud the
[30:08] pyramid to bring Jesus Christ down here
[30:11] on the Earth
[30:15] this is to cap off the pyramid this is
[30:18] the Capstone to cap off the pyramid
[30:21] because in the east in Egypt Enoch's
[30:25] pyramid was not capped off
[30:28] he said the reason why they didn't cap
[30:31] off the uh the pyramid because the
[30:33] Capstone was rejected right Jesus was
[30:36] rejected in the east
[30:38] so as you see what about I'm kind of
[30:42] explained it when he took a a US dollar
[30:45] bill
[30:46] when he flipped over the US dollar bill
[30:48] he showed there was a pyramid there with
[30:50] the Capstone on the top
[30:52] he said these things have uh spiritual
[30:55] application to it
[30:57] because this is West Coast
[31:00] in the east coast in in in the East they
[31:03] didn't cap off the the Capstone the uh
[31:05] the pyramid but in the west coast here
[31:08] in America the pyramid had a cup Stone
[31:12] which means in the East when God came
[31:15] down for the first time in um in uh in
[31:18] in Israel in the time of Moses he came
[31:21] down to talk to the people where they
[31:23] asked Moses could we talk to that God
[31:25] and God asked Moses to prepare the
[31:27] people and to come to the mountain the
[31:29] mountain was the Mount Sinai which means
[31:32] the mountain of the Sun rising
[31:35] and then here we are in the west coast
[31:37] in America
[31:38] in Arizona to the sunset Mountain
[31:44] this is where the Capstone has to come
[31:46] to cap off that pyramid and this is the
[31:50] time we are living in
[31:55] so all along his life brother Branham
[31:58] veiled
[32:00] this big beings which is God himself
[32:04] in his life
[32:08] God allowed even the uh mediums to
[32:12] see that light
[32:13] and she talked about it she told William
[32:15] Branham about that light
[32:18] but religious people they took it as of
[32:21] the devil that's why he went to pray
[32:24] and God showed him
[32:26] I know many of us have uh heard him
[32:29] talking about this light
[32:31] when he was giving his testimony he said
[32:33] this is
[32:35] the same pillow fight that laid the
[32:37] children visa for me jumped onto the
[32:38] Palestine and when when the angel came
[32:41] to him in the cave he started quoting
[32:43] the Bible
[32:48] to give him confidence and then when he
[32:51] started complaining about his uh
[32:52] education he said I won't be able to
[32:55] attract people I'm not educated
[32:58] the angel said I will be with you
[33:02] tonight this is again
[33:04] the Angelic Ministry
[33:10] the very Ministry of William Branham is
[33:13] to turn us back to the Faith of Our
[33:15] Fathers
[33:18] what was the Faith of Our Fathers
[33:21] they had the new birth
[33:24] which means the revelation of Jesus
[33:26] Christ
[33:27] the new birth is when you have the
[33:30] revelation of who is Jesus Christ
[33:36] I want to talk a little bit here about
[33:38] the connection of the revelation of
[33:40] Jesus Christ
[33:41] and the new birth
[33:47] in Genesis 1
[33:50] verse 26 God says let us
[33:54] create a man
[33:57] like unto us
[33:58] like in our image
[34:01] it seems like God is talking to someone
[34:03] else because he said let us
[34:05] make a man
[34:07] but he was not talking to somebody else
[34:09] was talking to himself as a
[34:13] he has a many attributes was talking to
[34:15] his attributes because he has to be a
[34:17] father a son a savior
[34:21] he was talking to his attributes
[34:24] God is Spirit the Bible says and those
[34:27] that worship him that must worship Him
[34:29] in truth and in spirit
[34:33] let us make Command in our likeness in
[34:36] our image who is God Spirit word and
[34:40] flesh
[34:43] demand that God has to create uh has to
[34:45] create it has to be
[34:47] follow the same pathway
[34:49] spirit
[34:51] soul
[34:52] I'm Spirit word and flesh
[34:56] but in the message of who is this
[34:59] Melchizedek says we skipped
[35:03] the theophany the body word
[35:06] God has put us in these bodies to to be
[35:09] tempted
[35:12] because in this form of the word
[35:16] we would know everything
[35:19] if we had come through following the
[35:23] normal pathway would have got into this
[35:26] theophany in the body world we have
[35:28] known everything and therefore would
[35:31] have hindered
[35:33] some God's program to be performed
[35:36] that's why God put us directly into this
[35:38] bodies to be tempted
[35:43] and what I'm says one time means it's in
[35:45] the Bible Moses wanted to see him
[35:49] I want to see the form I want to see you
[35:52] and God hid Moses into the Rock as he
[35:55] was passing by Moses said I saw it was
[35:58] like a back of a human being
[36:01] and what about them says he was coming
[36:03] down gradually
[36:05] he came into a flesh of a human being
[36:08] before even he came into the body of
[36:10] Jesus Christ
[36:12] remember of that Melchizedek
[36:16] who didn't have any father any mother
[36:18] beginning of the days or end of the days
[36:24] he was coming down gradually until one
[36:27] day
[36:28] he was born
[36:31] we need to remember that life comes here
[36:35] on the earth three ways
[36:40] Adam came here on the earth a full man
[36:44] God formed him and put the soul in him
[36:48] and he was born in the Kingdom
[36:55] Jesus Christ came here on the Earth
[37:01] he was birthed
[37:03] by a woman but an angel came and spoke
[37:06] the word
[37:07] and the spirit of God
[37:09] came
[37:11] to vivified or to leave to give life to
[37:15] the uh words and Jesus was born
[37:20] Jesus Christ
[37:21] Adam didn't have to be born again
[37:23] because they were born in the Kingdom
[37:25] but the rest of us after the scene after
[37:27] the fall
[37:29] we are born outside of the Kingdom
[37:32] that's why we need to be born again
[37:37] because Jesus Christ said
[37:40] unless the man is born again
[37:44] he cannot see the kingdom of God
[37:50] to be born of water no Spirit that's how
[37:54] Jesus was born
[37:56] water talks about the word and the
[37:58] spirit
[37:59] of God himself
[38:02] that's when Nicodemus came to ask and
[38:04] how can a man
[38:06] that is born already a big and grown-up
[38:09] man and go back to the womb of his
[38:11] mother and be born again he didn't
[38:13] understand that concept
[38:14] and Jesus Christ said
[38:18] that which born of the spirit is a
[38:20] spirit and that which born
[38:22] which is born of flesh's Flesh
[38:26] born again
[38:27] man it's like a wind that is blowing you
[38:30] don't know which way it's coming and you
[38:32] don't even know which way it's going
[38:35] it's exactly like Jesus Christ when he
[38:37] died and he rose again when those two
[38:39] disciples were talking about him going
[38:41] to the to immense he joined them the way
[38:44] he came in they didn't see him
[38:47] when he talked to them in the house
[38:49] after he broke the braid when they
[38:52] recognized him he disappeared the way he
[38:54] went they didn't know
[39:02] let's read the prophet here in uh
[39:06] in the message of Hebrews chapter 4
[39:09] 1957.
[39:12] he say this
[39:14] as we had it
[39:16] the other night God in the beginning was
[39:19] spirit
[39:21] and then from God went out the logos
[39:25] or the theophany
[39:27] which was a form of a man called the son
[39:30] of God
[39:32] he came in the earth in a body of Flesh
[39:35] even before he came in Jesus Christ
[39:39] now swallow that once brother
[39:42] I will prove it to you when Moses saw
[39:45] him he said let me see your form Lord
[39:49] and God hid him in the rock
[39:52] and when he passed by he said it was the
[39:55] back part of a man
[39:57] that was the theophany
[39:59] it's exactly
[40:01] then that theophany had to be made flesh
[40:05] not another person but the same person
[40:09] had to come to become flesh to take this
[40:12] thing out of the death
[40:15] like a bee when it stings
[40:17] it leaves a stinger
[40:19] and he never left that he could put a
[40:22] sting in a human flesh because it's sin
[40:26] but brother
[40:27] when his tongue the immanuel's flesh
[40:30] he lost the Stinger
[40:32] yes sir he can pause
[40:36] but he ain't got no Stinger no more
[40:45] so I need you to give you to give me
[40:48] your undivided attention because I'm
[40:50] trying to
[40:51] go somewhere here
[40:56] this theophany that we
[40:58] skipped
[41:00] that's where we have to go back to
[41:03] that's the reason why we come to church
[41:05] that's the reason why we read the word
[41:07] because the new birth is with water and
[41:11] spirit
[41:12] when we talk about the water it's the
[41:14] word
[41:15] we're talking about the spirit that's
[41:16] the holy spirit that the spirit of God
[41:21] and that's your theophany
[41:23] and what about them says sometimes you
[41:25] feel like full of joy what is that
[41:27] because you are bumping into your
[41:29] theophany
[41:36] guess what
[41:38] family your birth
[41:40] until your death or the Rapture if we
[41:42] have to leave this world by those two
[41:46] means you be protected because God gave
[41:49] charge to the angels to protect you the
[41:52] Bible says in all your ways
[41:56] no wonder we heard here about the
[41:59] brothers that were in a car accident
[42:01] thank God that nothing happened to them
[42:04] guess what Angels were given charge to
[42:08] watch over them
[42:17] now this minister of William Branham as
[42:20] I said is to bring us back to the Faith
[42:23] of Our Fathers
[42:25] our fathers had the revelation of who
[42:28] Jesus was
[42:29] because one day he questioned them who
[42:31] do you say that I am May the son of man
[42:34] they start talking about other people
[42:37] they say you are Jeremiah you are not no
[42:40] no not about them you what do you say
[42:42] about me
[42:43] and Peter had that Revelation he said
[42:45] you are
[42:47] the son of living God
[42:52] Jesus Christ knew that
[42:54] it has to be with the Revelation
[42:56] directly coming from above
[42:59] right because what John what Peter said
[43:05] was something that could only revealed
[43:08] to a human being by God himself
[43:11] because here out of God out of the
[43:15] Spirit came out the logos
[43:17] nobody knew these things nobody has seen
[43:20] these things
[43:22] until that day when God revealed it to
[43:24] Peter
[43:26] and that's the foundation even of the
[43:28] church
[43:29] and that's the new birth why the new
[43:31] birth because
[43:34] we have to be God became us and we have
[43:37] to become him
[43:40] Spirit theophany body words and in the
[43:43] flesh
[43:45] we came from Spirit in this body but we
[43:48] have to catch up
[43:49] go back into our theophany
[43:53] be birthed in the Kingdom because we're
[43:56] birthed outside of the Kingdom
[44:02] our fathers knew who they were
[44:06] does the identification
[44:09] not only who God is Not only who Jesus
[44:12] was but
[44:16] who they are themselves
[44:20] the question John the Baptist who do you
[44:23] say you are
[44:25] because the Pharisees and services has
[44:27] sent us to ask you of who you are tell
[44:30] us
[44:32] he didn't say um
[44:34] the son of Elizabeth
[44:37] in Zechariah no
[44:41] I'm The Voice
[44:44] in the wilderness
[44:48] but as I the same question might be
[44:50] questioned to you tonight who are you
[44:53] even though you know your parents
[44:55] but as a Believer You Should Know Who
[44:57] You Are
[45:00] William Branham when he came here on the
[45:02] earth he knew his ministry he knew
[45:05] where he comes from in the Bible Malachi
[45:09] 4.
[45:10] that's the Faith of Our Fathers they
[45:13] knew who they were they knew who God was
[45:18] they had the awareness of Angels or
[45:22] Angelic Realm
[45:29] when Peter was in the prison
[45:32] because Herod was killing
[45:35] their disciples it was killing one after
[45:37] another Peter was arrested and put in
[45:39] jail
[45:40] the time was getting nigh for him to be
[45:44] killed
[45:46] but the Faith of Our Fathers
[45:49] they had a dedicated life
[45:51] they had a life of consecration that's
[45:54] why they were gathering somewhere
[45:56] praying for Peter
[46:01] and as they were praying God dispatched
[46:04] an angel in the prison
[46:06] the angel came to free
[46:09] Peter
[46:11] and when Peter got out of the prison
[46:14] as barabaram says hit here
[46:16] let's read in uh
[46:18] Hebrews chapter 3
[46:20] 1957. let's just read uh highlighted
[46:24] portion to save the time
[46:28] so they opened the door
[46:29] she said it's Peter
[46:34] they said oh oh my he's dead
[46:38] that's his angel
[46:42] standing there see
[46:44] done God in his glorified body you know
[46:47] that theophany remember how we took it
[46:51] the big diamond
[46:53] and how it reflected the light how it
[46:57] went back through there
[47:00] this Earthly Tabernacle
[47:02] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[47:07] and they thought Peter then died
[47:11] and this old body had dropped
[47:14] and they'd buried it in a few days
[47:19] and he had entered into
[47:22] his angel
[47:25] or his glorified not glorified body but
[47:28] in his theophany
[47:33] the body that's already prepared
[47:41] he had had a knowledge of theophany
[47:45] that's why the Bible says in uh Matthew
[47:51] chapter 18.
[47:53] verse 10 I believe
[48:07] the Bible says this Matthew 18 chapter
[48:09] 18 verse 10 take heed that you despise
[48:13] not one of these little ones
[48:16] for I say unto you that in heaven their
[48:20] Angels do always
[48:23] behold the face of My Father which is in
[48:28] heaven
[48:29] that's our ethiophen is
[48:33] they thought Peter was
[48:36] dead and
[48:37] his Angel which is his theophany was at
[48:40] the door but what you forgot to what you
[48:43] didn't know was
[48:44] if he was in his body in his theophany
[48:49] he could not knock it at all
[48:51] he would have just walked through
[48:58] they recognize the voice
[49:00] like the prophet of God recognized the
[49:02] voice of the angel
[49:04] regardless of the form that angel was
[49:06] taking but still William Branham was
[49:08] aware of that voice
[49:11] because when he spoke to him in the cave
[49:13] he said I knew it was the same voice
[49:15] that spoke to me all along
[49:19] you might be old in this body
[49:21] might be weak but the voice still the
[49:23] same we can recognize by The Voice
[49:26] remember my own mom when she died she
[49:29] was in her 70s
[49:31] when I was talking to her I heard the
[49:33] voice that I was here
[49:35] but when I put the picture to the voice
[49:37] was totally different
[49:39] but the lady said that was Rhoda she
[49:42] said that's Peter
[49:44] and he was knocking no that's his angel
[49:47] that his theophany no
[49:49] that's him
[49:50] and when he came in
[49:52] Peter related I told him what had
[49:55] happened to him in the prison he said I
[49:57] was freed and I knew because he didn't
[49:59] understand how he got out of prison
[50:01] when when God does something for you
[50:04] it's always Supernatural we cannot
[50:06] understand that right away
[50:08] it takes a time for you to realize what
[50:10] happened to me
[50:12] was a hand of God
[50:14] because our fathers they had the the the
[50:18] faith of our heart or our fathers
[50:21] they had the awareness of angels
[50:24] because Peter said now I know that the
[50:28] Lord has sent his Angel to free me from
[50:31] the prison
[50:32] because in in the
[50:34] Psalm 34 the Bible says the angel of God
[50:39] Encompass all around us
[50:42] and he delivers
[50:45] those that fear Him
[50:49] that's why Jesus Christ left the glory
[50:52] like Abraham left one side of the land
[50:55] to the other side of the land to free
[50:57] lot his nephew
[51:00] Jesus Christ left to Glory came down
[51:02] here on the earth and even way down in
[51:04] hell to free those that feared him in
[51:07] those days when they were alive
[51:10] they died in faith and he came down from
[51:12] Glory came down here on the earth went
[51:14] down in hell he freed them
[51:17] because they feared him
[51:20] says he didn't say everybody come out of
[51:23] the Tomb
[51:25] when he came to bring Lazarus
[51:27] to life he said Lazarus
[51:33] that's why the constellation of seven
[51:35] angels
[51:37] he has come down
[51:41] to free us and to get us out of the
[51:44] allowed this year
[51:45] out of the darkness of this end time out
[51:48] of sins
[51:50] no wonder people they don't argue about
[51:52] the rest of the uh the the seals it's
[51:56] only the seventh seal that's the devil
[51:59] because he doesn't want us to recognize
[52:01] the Creator angel that has come down in
[52:05] this end time to free us
[52:07] to give us freedom
[52:16] our fathers
[52:19] behave the consecrated life as I said
[52:26] when Peter was in the prison
[52:28] and came together
[52:32] God bless you brother Robert
[52:34] he had a revelation first
[52:38] of if I bring
[52:40] this prayer requests to the church to
[52:42] the congregation to be prayed for it and
[52:45] I believe God will do a miracle
[52:48] and you've read in the Bible the Bible
[52:49] says a constant prayers
[52:52] were offered
[52:55] for Peter
[52:56] was not one time prayer was constantly
[52:59] amen
[53:02] amen we should not stop praying for
[53:03] Josiah we keep praying until we see him
[53:05] here being dedicated
[53:07] not even there we still have to pray for
[53:09] him all along his life not only him all
[53:13] the children all the brothers and
[53:14] sisters
[53:16] we should have this because this is what
[53:19] the message of William Branham has done
[53:20] to bring us back to that faith
[53:23] where they had a dedicated life
[53:26] they had to pray for one another
[53:28] the prayers were had were heard by God
[53:31] in in heaven and an angel was sent into
[53:34] the prison
[53:35] same thing we can still pray for our
[53:37] brother in Mexico in prison
[53:40] we can pray for any brother for any
[53:42] sister that sickness has put in the
[53:44] prison of sickness we can pray and God
[53:47] will send his Angel to free him for her
[53:50] from the sickness from whatever
[53:52] Condition You Are
[54:04] and with our fathers
[54:08] the angels
[54:10] knew them well
[54:12] even
[54:13] the addresses wherever they were living
[54:18] because Cornelius
[54:20] a man that feared God he was
[54:23] a man of prayers
[54:26] and one day when he was praying the
[54:28] angel came to him
[54:33] told him to send a man to go to Joppa
[54:39] the angel even
[54:40] gave him Precision of where the house
[54:42] where to find Peter was
[54:45] go by the seaside
[54:50] isn't that strange to see that the same
[54:52] angel in this end time when William
[54:54] Branham was
[54:55] praying for the sick
[55:00] have you heard him in the Deep College
[55:02] to the Deep
[55:05] he said you know what I'm waiting for
[55:08] I'm waiting for the angel
[55:10] and when that angel showed up
[55:13] he started talking to the sister
[55:17] he said I don't know you
[55:19] you don't know me but he knows you and
[55:23] he knows me
[55:24] like in the in the New Testament
[55:26] that angel knew who Peter was and he
[55:29] knew who Cornelius was
[55:33] and this the angel in the time of our
[55:36] fathers could direct the man sent by
[55:38] Cornelius to Peter could direct them to
[55:41] the very place where Peter was
[55:43] and the angels in this end time was
[55:46] talking to the woman giving even her
[55:48] address
[55:49] your name is Eva
[55:54] we're not serving a dead God
[55:56] we are in the Bible here
[56:10] says in the blind bath females
[56:13] 1956
[56:18] is such a blessing here
[56:22] I was coming
[56:25] watch few hairs
[56:27] I had left on my head
[56:30] she said to me she said Billy she said
[56:33] you are getting bolted head honey
[56:36] and I said I know sweetheart
[56:40] but I haven't lost
[56:41] one of them
[56:44] she said what
[56:46] I said I haven't lost one she said where
[56:49] are they at
[56:51] and I said I tell you something
[56:54] sweetheart
[56:55] you might not know
[56:58] but if you tell me where they were or
[57:02] there was as he said before I got them
[57:05] I'll tell you where they are waiting for
[57:08] me
[57:09] to come to them
[57:15] they were somewhere
[57:17] is that right
[57:19] whatever they was they are waiting for
[57:21] me
[57:23] and I knew
[57:25] a new body is waiting there someday
[57:29] not only for me but all that love he's
[57:32] appearing I believe you are waiting for
[57:35] he's appearing
[57:37] that's right someday the old model
[57:40] will take away and Immortal will take
[57:44] its place
[57:46] the sorrows and the sickness
[57:49] and headache at heartache will fade away
[57:53] to a new body
[57:55] held forever
[57:56] and in the presence of God
[57:59] wouldn't that be wonderful
[58:01] then we we all have a big happy birthday
[58:06] won't we
[58:08] we just had one on Sunday
[58:12] well sister Solange biaya
[58:15] God bless your sweet heart
[58:17] we're going to have very soon a big
[58:20] birthday because we'll be birthed into
[58:22] the kingdom it's going to be a big
[58:24] birthday for everybody
[58:27] celebrate it forever
[58:30] until that time may God smile his riches
[58:33] blessings upon you upon all my beloved
[58:38] friends upon my critics
[58:41] upon all may God
[58:44] richest blessings rests on you
[58:48] so few years after this
[58:53] I know if I have to read this because
[58:55] it's a long reading again
[59:01] it looked like just a statement he made
[59:03] he was talking with his wife
[59:06] but little did we know it was a reality
[59:08] after some some years
[59:13] the man of God was laying down
[59:17] in his bed in his room
[59:19] and he started questioning himself
[59:21] William Branham now you are in your 50s
[59:24] seems like we haven't done much for the
[59:26] for the Lord we need to do something
[59:29] and The Voice start talking to him
[59:31] that's the same voice would you like to
[59:33] see beyond the curtain of time
[59:36] he say yeah I would like to
[59:39] to say such a thing
[59:42] let's read him here we're going to
[59:44] comment that later on
[59:45] but that morning when I felt something
[59:47] come over me
[59:50] and I thought usually like a vision
[59:52] comes
[59:53] and I looked I looked and I thought my
[59:56] what is this
[59:58] and I looked at Greek Green Hill a great
[1:00:02] Green Hills and young woman just coming
[1:00:05] from everywhere
[1:00:07] by the tens of thousands and thousands
[1:00:10] of thousands
[1:00:12] and they were all coming long hair
[1:00:15] hanging down they back white
[1:00:19] the long hair
[1:00:21] hanging down their back
[1:00:23] white robes on barefooted
[1:00:26] screaming hollering our brother
[1:00:30] I thought now this is strange
[1:00:33] and I turned back around and I looked
[1:00:36] and there I laid right there
[1:00:41] and there was my wife laying there on
[1:00:43] the bed
[1:00:46] and I said now you know what I died I
[1:00:51] say that's what happened I've died
[1:00:54] and I said I might have had heart attack
[1:00:57] or something
[1:00:59] I've died
[1:01:01] there lays my body so I want to say
[1:01:04] something here
[1:01:06] this is two bodies
[1:01:08] this is these are two men
[1:01:12] the one in the bed was a main bone of a
[1:01:14] woman
[1:01:15] the one here in the glory of was a man
[1:01:17] born of a spirit
[1:01:19] and what about them says in the
[1:01:21] man I'm going ahead of myself
[1:01:24] he said the body the flesh is the Veil
[1:01:27] is preventing us to see beyond the
[1:01:30] curtain of time
[1:01:33] the flesh is the Veil
[1:01:36] this side is the main bone of a woman
[1:01:40] with short of Life full of misery
[1:01:43] agitated all the time
[1:01:47] he he had fear of knife even knives
[1:01:51] because he said I'm glad I wasn't living
[1:01:53] in the days where they used to use the
[1:01:54] sword
[1:01:56] and he was afraid to die because Barbara
[1:01:59] says I was afraid to die because I
[1:02:00] didn't know where I was going to be
[1:02:02] am I going to be a spirit
[1:02:05] I thought when we die I'm going to be a
[1:02:07] spirit and another brother will pass by
[1:02:08] and I will pass by in two spirits
[1:02:12] I might drop something here again
[1:02:14] you know when angels
[1:02:17] in heaven when they lost those that have
[1:02:19] been deceived by Lucifer
[1:02:21] when they lost the Angelic bodies
[1:02:25] they became spirit
[1:02:29] lying Spirit remember of that lying
[1:02:31] Spirit when God was having a a
[1:02:35] a meeting
[1:02:37] was looking the ways to
[1:02:40] cause the the words of the Prophet to be
[1:02:42] fulfilled
[1:02:44] he could not send an angel there because
[1:02:46] those angels with him they can only say
[1:02:49] the truth
[1:02:51] they could not say a lie
[1:02:54] that's why he was looking for what
[1:02:56] should I do and the spirit Came From
[1:02:58] Hell
[1:03:00] that used to be an angel with a body now
[1:03:02] doesn't have a body is a spirit a lying
[1:03:04] spirit
[1:03:05] what are you gonna do I'm gonna dwell in
[1:03:07] the prophet and the cause
[1:03:10] the king to believe the lie
[1:03:14] that's what about him says your pastor
[1:03:16] behind the secret desk is an angel of
[1:03:19] God
[1:03:20] all the pastors and ministers behind the
[1:03:23] sacred desk that can only tell the truth
[1:03:25] because they are angels of the Lord
[1:03:29] because
[1:03:31] those angels could not say the true the
[1:03:33] LIE
[1:03:35] and then God is the god of Holy Spirit
[1:03:40] he can use the devil as a whip to
[1:03:43] correct us
[1:03:48] and what about him says I was afraid to
[1:03:51] die because I was going to become a
[1:03:52] spirit
[1:03:54] but little did he know because he said I
[1:03:56] was afraid of this
[1:03:58] because he saw the reality
[1:04:00] he said is this a vision try to bite his
[1:04:02] fingers real
[1:04:06] a man born of a man
[1:04:08] in a man born of a woman laying down
[1:04:10] there
[1:04:12] because when we go beyond the king of
[1:04:14] time
[1:04:15] we are we are outside of this Veil and
[1:04:18] we can see
[1:04:20] like our brothers and sisters are beyond
[1:04:22] the those that have gone on they can see
[1:04:25] us but we cannot see them because we're
[1:04:26] still in this Veil
[1:04:28] because William Branham could see that
[1:04:30] body that body was just still laying
[1:04:32] down there
[1:04:34] didn't know nothing
[1:04:36] he looked at the body still laying there
[1:04:38] he looked at all the claws and
[1:04:40] everything was there
[1:04:42] he could see that but that body could
[1:04:44] not see him
[1:04:47] the veil of the flesh
[1:04:49] that's why we need to
[1:04:51] we don't have to give it the means for
[1:04:53] it to give to fight us because the very
[1:04:57] enemy of William Branham is William
[1:04:58] Branham himself
[1:05:03] we're going back to Earth and he said
[1:05:05] this
[1:05:10] and there I was looking I thought there
[1:05:13] was there was my wife
[1:05:16] there's everything
[1:05:17] there's my shirt hanging there on that
[1:05:20] bed post
[1:05:22] and I thought here I am I looked around
[1:05:25] I looked around again and these women
[1:05:28] were all coming
[1:05:31] and they were I looked coming this way
[1:05:35] and they come
[1:05:37] my brothers all genuine all of them
[1:05:41] looked to be to be young man
[1:05:47] so people that are talking about the
[1:05:49] dressing special sisters the dressing so
[1:05:51] you have the answer here when he went to
[1:05:53] in heaven
[1:05:55] he gave the description of how the
[1:05:57] sisters dressed long hair
[1:05:59] robe
[1:06:01] right
[1:06:02] and then he gave the description of hell
[1:06:05] makeup
[1:06:08] when they passed by him the
[1:06:11] there was just they just make up and
[1:06:16] dressing or immoral way you know now you
[1:06:20] have two pictures you know you can make
[1:06:22] a decision of which one you want to do
[1:06:24] to build a reflection of of Heaven or
[1:06:26] Hell
[1:06:29] you have two pictures here
[1:06:33] they screaming our precious brother
[1:06:39] why I didn't know what to think
[1:06:42] I thought this is strange
[1:06:45] I looked back
[1:06:47] I wasn't
[1:06:49] old man I was young
[1:06:53] now
[1:06:55] that man laying down there has a bolded
[1:06:58] hair head
[1:06:59] and this one here was young full of hair
[1:07:04] because he told honey I haven't lost
[1:07:06] one of my hair
[1:07:08] wherever they were before I got them
[1:07:10] they are there waiting for me few years
[1:07:12] after that he got them
[1:07:18] he seems to be funny but this is the
[1:07:19] reality
[1:07:29] I thought this is strange thing
[1:07:32] I thought is this vision
[1:07:35] I bite my finger
[1:07:37] and I thought no
[1:07:39] the kind of vision I've had
[1:07:44] and then there is something begin to
[1:07:47] talk to me
[1:07:48] up here and said you have entered in
[1:07:52] with your people
[1:07:53] that's the same voice
[1:07:57] that talk to him all along
[1:08:01] the the uh all these brenhams
[1:08:06] he said they are your converts to Christ
[1:08:10] are you the convert to Christ for
[1:08:14] and these women I know have always been
[1:08:17] considered kind of they call me a woman
[1:08:20] header so
[1:08:23] well I'm not
[1:08:25] because I believe see I don't like you
[1:08:27] moral indecent I like real genuine
[1:08:32] Sisters in Christ amen which you are
[1:08:44] our father they had the knowledge of the
[1:08:46] theophany like I said
[1:08:50] to
[1:08:52] as I'm going to the end of the service
[1:08:55] here in this end time we are called
[1:08:59] to a new consecration
[1:09:02] and to a deep dedication
[1:09:06] and we have to be one without theophany
[1:09:11] and to live eternally in our glorified
[1:09:14] body
[1:09:16] to get to that point
[1:09:18] because
[1:09:20] the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:09:23] are described here how they used to live
[1:09:27] whether it was a prayer life
[1:09:29] was the love among them
[1:09:32] was the awareness of the supernatural
[1:09:36] the awareness of God himself
[1:09:43] we need to come up higher
[1:09:50] in the realm of angels
[1:09:53] with great expectation
[1:09:58] this is for this Supernatural to take
[1:10:00] place and this is the time for these
[1:10:02] realities
[1:10:06] see
[1:10:07] angels
[1:10:09] all our life long will have angels
[1:10:14] one time Philip I mean the eunuch
[1:10:18] Ethiopians were he was reading searching
[1:10:21] the scriptures
[1:10:24] he wanted to know what was Isaiah
[1:10:26] talking about was here about himself
[1:10:28] about somebody else
[1:10:30] the Bible said bless those that are
[1:10:33] Hunger of the truth
[1:10:37] right and the angel looked and he saw
[1:10:41] Philip
[1:10:43] that's why we are called the mystical
[1:10:44] body of Jesus Christ
[1:10:49] the body when
[1:10:52] your toe has a problem
[1:10:54] your finger your hand will go down try
[1:10:57] to help your eyes will look way to go to
[1:11:00] the hospital so that's this is the body
[1:11:02] so God knows which part of the body to
[1:11:05] call and send to solve the problem
[1:11:07] Philip come up here go down there
[1:11:10] go close to the chariot
[1:11:14] and he found that unique Ethiopian
[1:11:16] struggling with the scriptures
[1:11:20] did you understand what you're reading
[1:11:22] about I don't know nobody so he had a
[1:11:25] deep hunger of the reality
[1:11:28] God send us the angel
[1:11:32] you yourself you might be an angel of
[1:11:35] God
[1:11:38] to go
[1:11:39] give warnings to people give you know
[1:11:43] blessings to people
[1:11:45] that's why we need to be aware of the
[1:11:48] supernatural of the spiritual realm and
[1:11:50] be in prayer for more because we don't
[1:11:51] know what time and what day the Lord
[1:11:53] will need you
[1:12:00] when men sinned in in Genesis
[1:12:04] the Bible say they put the
[1:12:06] the angel with the Flaming sword tried
[1:12:08] to prevent Adam and Eve to go touch the
[1:12:11] tree of life because God didn't want
[1:12:13] them to live eternally in sin
[1:12:17] and then now this in the now here after
[1:12:20] the coming of the Lord now these
[1:12:24] ministers behind the secret desk they
[1:12:26] are the angel of God with the two-edged
[1:12:29] sword the word of God
[1:12:31] pushing you to enter into
[1:12:35] and to have the uh the Tree of Life
[1:12:38] those one prevented
[1:12:41] the men to go touch the tree of life
[1:12:42] because in that condition they could not
[1:12:44] touch the Tree of Life to Live eternally
[1:12:46] insane but these angels here
[1:12:50] with the two aged sword they are pushing
[1:12:53] you
[1:12:55] to have the Tree of Life
[1:12:58] that's the ministry of angels
[1:13:01] we need to be aware of the Angels
[1:13:07] deep dedication
[1:13:11] that's why I call it a new consecration
[1:13:16] because they were in consecration back
[1:13:19] then
[1:13:20] for many years
[1:13:23] people didn't have such a consecration
[1:13:25] until this end time where this message
[1:13:28] has been sent to us to send us back to
[1:13:31] that Faith where we have to have the
[1:13:34] same Consecration and dedication as they
[1:13:37] used to have
[1:13:39] this is my prayer tonight as we stand to
[1:13:41] our feet musician why don't you make a
[1:13:44] way
[1:13:46] this is my
[1:13:48] prayer
[1:13:50] for this year
[1:13:52] to be dedicated to the Lord to
[1:13:55] consecrate ourselves to the Lord
[1:13:59] to be
[1:14:01] aware of angels because they are charged
[1:14:04] to keep us
[1:14:06] they are charged to give warning to us
[1:14:10] because remember when
[1:14:12] Joseph
[1:14:14] in his heart he was planning to get rid
[1:14:18] of Mary
[1:14:20] the angel saw that
[1:14:23] during the night time the angel came and
[1:14:25] told him don't do such a thing
[1:14:29] the angel of the Lord will be sent to
[1:14:32] you when you are about to make a mistake
[1:14:34] because the major eyes
[1:14:37] after they got lost
[1:14:41] the law striking the stars the star that
[1:14:43] was was leading them disappeared they
[1:14:46] ended up being in a wrong place
[1:14:49] the angel came
[1:14:52] telling them don't go back the same way
[1:14:57] an angel of God was saying to
[1:15:00] give a warning to Joseph
[1:15:04] when Mary was pregnant with the Lord
[1:15:09] go into Egypt
[1:15:11] because
[1:15:13] the governor
[1:15:15] politics they want to kill the child
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:18] The Book of Job says
[1:15:22] God talks in many ways sometimes in
[1:15:25] Visions when we are laying down we are
[1:15:27] sleeping
[1:15:28] give warnings to us
[1:15:30] send you an angel
[1:15:32] and he knows how to talk to us sometimes
[1:15:34] he comes during the night time where we
[1:15:35] are sleeping
[1:15:36] sometimes literally he'll send somebody
[1:15:38] a brother a sister
[1:15:43] regardless of the form he will take but
[1:15:45] you need to be aware
[1:15:48] say like Peter
[1:15:50] I know
[1:15:51] the Lord has sent his angel
[1:15:53] to deliver me
[1:15:55] because the Bible says
[1:15:58] the angel of the Lord Encompass all
[1:16:01] around those that fear him and he'll
[1:16:04] deliver them
[1:16:07] they are being given charge to watch
[1:16:09] over you as I said from your birth until
[1:16:12] you're living of this Earth
[1:16:15] either by Rapture or by Death
[1:16:19] nobody knows when
[1:16:22] nobody knows when you're going to die
[1:16:24] nobody knows when you're going to be in
[1:16:26] ruptured
[1:16:28] it depends on the Lord
[1:16:30] but until then we need to be aware of
[1:16:33] angels
[1:16:37] we need to come up higher
[1:16:39] in the realm of Revelation and vision
[1:16:44] we don't have to
[1:16:46] keep it as a routine come to church go
[1:16:49] home come to church go home no this
[1:16:51] message has come to bring us up higher
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:55] because we need to catch up remember
[1:16:57] without theophany
[1:17:01] the theophone is influencing you come up
[1:17:03] higher go to church read pray
[1:17:07] because that's the body word
[1:17:11] remember we're birthed outside of the
[1:17:13] Kingdom we need to be birthed into the
[1:17:16] kingdom to understand it
[1:17:19] that's the new birth
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:23] and for that to happen we need to know
[1:17:25] who Jesus is
[1:17:28] because when we know who he is then
[1:17:31] we'll become like him
[1:17:34] who is he he's the word
[1:17:38] because he was spirit
[1:17:40] he condensed himself into the body world
[1:17:44] and then in this form
[1:17:46] you'll know everything
[1:17:48] remember Daniel says in the end time the
[1:17:50] knowledge will be increasing
[1:17:52] [Music]
[1:17:53] that knowledge is the knowledge of the
[1:17:56] word of God when you read the message
[1:17:57] you will know a lot of things
[1:17:59] this is a word
[1:18:03] we need to go back to catch up
[1:18:06] without theophany
[1:18:09] is pulling us
[1:18:12] we don't have to be afraid no more
[1:18:15] when we die we have a body waiting for
[1:18:17] us
[1:18:21] William Brown was afraid
[1:18:23] but after he crossed the curtain of time
[1:18:26] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[1:18:28] when he crossed the divided line
[1:18:30] he realized
[1:18:32] I was afraid for no reason
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:39] deep consecration
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:43] new Consecration and dedication
[1:18:49] it's not the message to keep us here on
[1:18:50] the Earth
[1:18:53] is the message to take us home
[1:18:58] do you know William Branham is our
[1:19:00] alienser
[1:19:03] [Music]
[1:19:06] there's something here that I'm about to
[1:19:08] say but it's going to be helpful it's
[1:19:09] not some
[1:19:11] you know some Doctrine but it's
[1:19:13] something that might be helpful to you
[1:19:14] he helped me before
[1:19:16] you go read even tonight or some other
[1:19:19] time when you have the time
[1:19:21] in the Book of Genesis 24

[1:19:37] at the same time
[1:19:38] a laser with Rebecca they were coming

[1:19:49] and when you are in the field is just
[1:19:50] the head
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:53] and Rebecca questioned Elisa who's that
[1:19:56] man that coming across our pathway
[1:20:00] she didn't know Isaac
[1:20:02] Elias is the one that knows Isaac
[1:20:06] our elieza of this end time William
[1:20:08] Branham he knows but that's why he told
[1:20:10] us this picture of Offman
[1:20:12] looks like the Jesus that I always see
[1:20:15] in the vision he's the one that saw him
[1:20:22] 63
[1:20:24] 64 65 that's verse I'm talking about the
[1:20:27] chapter 24. chapter 65 done
[1:20:31] Eliezer
[1:20:33] decreased
[1:20:36] Isaac increased
[1:20:39] and he took Rebecca into the tent of his
[1:20:42] mother the tent where
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:47] Sarah was
[1:20:48] changed
