[54:27] teach them God's ways
[54:30] don't tell them
[54:32] live the ways before that they see it in

[54:43] Bridal company

[54:49] excited what I'm saying right now this
[54:51] kid yeah you're sharp aren't you buddy
[54:53] yeah you yeah you like that
[54:59] we're gonna dedicate
[55:02] this little son
[55:04] back to God
[55:06] it's found in Luke chapter 18.
[55:10] verse 15 and they brought unto him also
[55:12] infants
[55:14] that he would touch them
[55:16] but when his disciples saw it they
[55:19] rebuked them
[55:20] and Jesus called them unto him and said
[55:24] suffer little children
[55:26] to come unto me and forbid them not
[55:29] for of such is the kingdom of God
[55:32] verily I say unto you whosoever shall
[55:34] not receive the kingdom
[55:36] of God as a little child
[55:39] shall in no wise enter
[55:42] therein
[55:45] so they brought little children that he
[55:48] would bless him
[55:50] Come a Little Closer
[55:54] they have named him Alden Rafe
[55:59] and
[56:01] I didn't have it printed out here
[56:04] so I have to
[56:11] I'm sorry just take a moment here it is
[56:17] the English name Alden means an old
[56:20] friend it means wise protector
[56:23] that's a good combination
[56:27] and we choose it not only because it's a
[56:29] strong family name in Andrews lineage
[56:31] but we pray that he's a real friend to
[56:34] all like Jesus was and stands up for the
[56:37] truth and those around him
[56:40] Rafe has several meanings from different
[56:42] languages God has healed in Hebrew
[56:46] a wise wolf an Old Norse and kind and
[56:49] compassionate in Arabic
[56:52] so we're going to pray right now over
[56:54] Alden Rafe
[56:56] and we're going to ask God to let him
[56:59] be a wise protector and an old friend to
[57:01] those that He makes friends with and may
[57:05] God give him the wisdom
[57:07] and the discernment of who he brings
[57:09] close to him that he calls friends
[57:12] let's pray heavenly father as I lay my
[57:16] hands upon Alden Rafe now in the name of
[57:20] the Lord Jesus Christ I bring him to you
[57:23] father to be dedicated back to you for a
[57:26] life of service
[57:28] would you watch over him and keep him
[57:30] all the days of his life father I pray
[57:33] that as his mother and father teach him
[57:35] thy ways o God that he will sit and
[57:38] listen and he will learn
[57:40] and God you will reveal yourself to him
[57:43] as you did to Abel I pray heavenly
[57:47] father that you would give him a life of
[57:50] health and happiness I pray that he will
[57:53] be a blessing to his mother and father
[57:55] that he will be an obedient son
[57:58] father I pray now
[58:00] a blessing upon Alden Rafe I bless you
[58:05] in the name of Jesus Christ
[58:08] and back to God from whence your life
[58:10] was given
[58:12] may God bless you all the days of your
[58:14] life I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[58:17] amen
[58:20] amen look at it
[58:23] yeah that kind of mesmerizing right
[58:25] there
[58:27] okay catch the there we go
[58:31] all right thank you God bless you so
[58:34] much God bless you Andrew
[58:39] amen
[58:40] and we also brother Israel and sister
[58:45] Mariah
[58:47] I'd like to pray over them if they'll
[58:49] come here at this time
[58:57] they've just recently got gotten engaged
[59:01] we showed the photo of that
[59:04] a while back
[59:08] and sometimes I'm privy to
[59:11] some of these things
[59:14] and other times I'm the last in the
[59:16] church to know
[59:19] but I wasn't with them
[59:21] brother Israel was so gracious to come
[59:24] to me
[59:25] he told me some of the plans
[59:27] and what he was wanting to do and
[59:30] everything and we've watched the two of
[59:32] you grow up
[59:34] in this church we've seen you become
[59:36] both very very faithful
[59:39] and we know that at times in our lives
[59:42] and as young people you struggle and you
[59:44] try to find an identity but when God
[59:46] comes to you and gives you revelation
[59:48] you realize who you are you take your
[59:50] position
[59:51] and once you take your position and you
[59:54] know who you are
[59:56] and then she finds her position
[59:59] and then the two of you coming together
[1:00:03] then what God does is he gives you an
[1:00:06] umbrella of authority that goes over
[1:00:07] both of you because your identity is in
[1:00:10] this word
[1:00:12] we don't take it out of the world we
[1:00:14] don't take it out of anything from
[1:00:16] Hollywood we take it out of his holy
[1:00:18] word
[1:00:19] and we're proud of both of you
[1:00:21] and we know that even as Joseph was his
[1:00:24] spouse to marry and and they were going
[1:00:27] to Bethlehem and everything and he had a
[1:00:31] dream and she found he found out she was
[1:00:33] already with child so he went to put her
[1:00:36] away and the angel said fear not Joseph
[1:00:40] to take Mary thy wife they were espoused
[1:00:43] it is the promise
[1:00:45] of God that marries you in God's eyes
[1:00:48] though he had never touched her he'd
[1:00:50] never lived with her as husband and wife
[1:00:52] at that time and so right now we know
[1:00:55] that the promise of God has is what god
[1:00:59] holds you accountable to
[1:01:02] and and stuff but it isn't until after
[1:01:05] the ceremony that you go and you live as
[1:01:08] husband and why so live clean live
[1:01:11] before God let these young people and
[1:01:13] let everyone around see okay this this
[1:01:17] Holiness that the two of you have that
[1:01:20] when you come together and and you kiss
[1:01:23] for the first time that it be in the
[1:01:27] right way in the right direction because
[1:01:29] God will truly bless you if you'll do
[1:01:32] what he says to for you to do we love
[1:01:35] the two of you we're proud of you and
[1:01:37] we're going to ask God's blessings
[1:01:40] upon the two of you
[1:01:43] Heavenly Father
[1:01:46] as I bring before you now and before
[1:01:49] this company of people and a family
[1:01:54] I bring these two before you father
[1:01:57] that they have saw fit Lord that they
[1:02:00] would choose one another
[1:02:03] and I pray that you will bless this
[1:02:06] Union o God
[1:02:08] this promise that has been made one to
[1:02:10] another and I pray that you will keep
[1:02:12] them till that day when they are married
[1:02:15] before the people
[1:02:17] that their lives would be a testimony
[1:02:20] father to all around them
[1:02:23] I thank you Father for giving us
[1:02:25] faithful couples faithful in you Lord
[1:02:29] because we know you are the one that
[1:02:32] hold us together
[1:02:34] and so father I bless them both in the
[1:02:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:39] and would you watch over them and keep
[1:02:41] them I pray in Jesus name
[1:02:44] amen amen do we have a a date yet of
[1:02:49] what we're looking at not

[1:03:35] you you may be seated God bless you
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:39] um
[1:03:41] you know I've been seeking the mind of
[1:03:44] the Lord I do with every sermon
[1:03:48] every sermon
[1:03:51] is conceived in inspiration
[1:03:55] and birthed in labor
[1:03:59] I labor and I wait before God on many
[1:04:03] things to give because I'm not here to
[1:04:05] just tickle your ear I'm not here to
[1:04:08] just say nice words I want to say
[1:04:10] something that has an effect
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:17] and I don't want to be religious
[1:04:20] I want to be a Christian
[1:04:24] and I want to live a life that is
[1:04:27] an example of my Lord and the reason I
[1:04:30] am here this morning is I fell in love
[1:04:32] with Jesus Christ and guess what I'm
[1:04:34] more in love with him today than I was
[1:04:36] when he first revealed himself to me and
[1:04:39] that's a reason why I'm here
[1:04:42] amen and I've I just had a thought
[1:04:46] uh that had come to me and I prayed
[1:04:49] about it and I and I labored and and as
[1:04:53] I always do but I want to preach to you
[1:04:58] about losing
[1:05:01] our simplicity
[1:05:03] let us stand together if you would as we
[1:05:06] take our Bibles together
[1:05:08] I want you to turn with me to Second
[1:05:10] Corinthians 11.
[1:05:14] thank you musicians God bless you
[1:05:27] second Corinthians chapter 11
[1:05:33] verses one through four
[1:05:35] and sister Teresa van art brother Ronnie
[1:05:39] God bless you it's good to have you here
[1:05:41] this morning may God bless your hearts
[1:05:46] and give you the desire of your heart
[1:05:50] amen we miss you when you're not here
[1:05:52] you give our love and greetings to
[1:05:54] brother Johan
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:58] second Corinthians
[1:06:01] 11.
[1:06:04] verses one through four
[1:06:08] what to God
[1:06:10] you could bear with me a little while in
[1:06:12] my Folly and indeed bear with
[1:06:15] me for I am jealous over you
[1:06:20] with a Godly jealousy
[1:06:23] this is
[1:06:25] unusual
[1:06:27] that God would be jealous
[1:06:30] and that there would be such thing as a
[1:06:32] Godly jealousy
[1:06:35] every true wife wants her husband
[1:06:40] to be jealous over her
[1:06:44] yeah she likes that
[1:06:49] Paul said I am jealous over you with a
[1:06:51] Godly jealousy
[1:06:54] for I have espoused you to one husband
[1:07:00] that I may present you as a chaste
[1:07:03] virgin
[1:07:04] to Christ
[1:07:08] but I fear
[1:07:13] lest by any means as the serpent
[1:07:17] beguiled Eve through his subtlety
[1:07:21] so your minds
[1:07:24] should be corrupted
[1:07:26] from the Simplicity that is in Christ
[1:07:34] for of he that cometh preacheth another
[1:07:36] Jesus
[1:07:40] whom we have not preached or if you
[1:07:42] receive another spirit
[1:07:45] which he have not received or another
[1:07:48] gospel
[1:07:50] which you have not accepted you might
[1:07:52] well bear with him
[1:07:55] may God
[1:07:57] bless the reading of his word you all
[1:08:00] may be seated this morning in his
[1:08:02] presence
[1:08:08] I wish to take from
[1:08:11] verse 3 I fear less by any means as the
[1:08:15] serpent beguiled Eve
[1:08:19] through his subtlety so your mind should
[1:08:22] be corrupted in the Simplicity that is
[1:08:24] in Christ
[1:08:26] those words spoke volumes to me and I
[1:08:29] wish to title my sermon this morning
[1:08:31] losing
[1:08:33] our simplicity
[1:08:36] now before I go on I received a
[1:08:38] correction in my back room because the
[1:08:40] Brethren came to me because I actually
[1:08:43] spelled it
[1:08:46] l-o-o-s-i-n-g loosing
[1:08:49] our Simplicity and my granddaughter
[1:08:52] Kailyn her great wisdom
[1:08:54] and ability with the English language
[1:08:56] and he said does he mean losing
[1:09:00] or losing
[1:09:02] I even asked my wife this morning and
[1:09:04] both of us she said no I think it's two
[1:09:07] o's
[1:09:09] and I say I think so too
[1:09:14] then I felt it and I said no I think
[1:09:17] it's 10 anyway it doesn't matter it is
[1:09:19] losing
[1:09:22] 1-0
[1:09:24] losing our Simplicity and I want to take
[1:09:27] for a thought and I am going to launch
[1:09:30] off
[1:09:31] for a next couple Services about
[1:09:33] Simplicity and what God does in
[1:09:37] Simplicity because we know that God is
[1:09:39] revealed in simplicity
[1:09:42] remember
[1:09:44] of all of the greatest sermons that the
[1:09:47] prophet preached
[1:09:49] and he's preaching a set of sermons
[1:09:52] called the revelation of the Seven Seals
[1:09:56] and he says but before I go and preach
[1:09:58] the revelation of the seals I feel very
[1:10:01] much led to tell you that God is
[1:10:04] revealed in simplicity so he lays the
[1:10:08] foundation for them to understand that
[1:10:10] the great Revelation that is about to
[1:10:13] come forth
[1:10:16] will be revealed
[1:10:18] in simplicity
[1:10:22] in second Corinthians 1
[1:10:25] It also says
[1:10:28] for our rejoicing in this the testimony
[1:10:32] of our conscience
[1:10:34] that in Simplicity and godly
[1:10:37] sincerity not with the fleshly wisdom
[1:10:40] with the grace of God
[1:10:45] I want all of you to to know that God is
[1:10:48] not understood by education
[1:10:51] you can't prove God by science
[1:10:55] in fact some of the greatest
[1:10:58] minds and philosophers and different
[1:11:01] ones and scientists
[1:11:04] have said we have looked into this great
[1:11:06] Cosmos
[1:11:08] and we've looked into the infinite
[1:11:11] and we've looked into the finite
[1:11:15] and whether we look out in the great
[1:11:17] Cosmos and we we look with telescopes
[1:11:21] and we can see millions of light years
[1:11:26] and we can take a
[1:11:29] microscope and we can now look into the
[1:11:32] finite
[1:11:33] and we can look at atoms and nuclei and
[1:11:38] we can look at DNA and we can see all of
[1:11:41] this and so from the finite to the
[1:11:44] infinite every one of them see
[1:11:47] we can tell you
[1:11:50] with an assurance that God's
[1:11:53] fingerprints
[1:11:54] are from the infinite to the finite
[1:11:58] this just didn't happen with a bang
[1:12:02] but so what if it was a bang
[1:12:05] I don't care
[1:12:07] because all we know is God said let
[1:12:09] there be light and bang there was light
[1:12:11] and God began to create and everything
[1:12:13] that God created he created by speaking
[1:12:16] the word
[1:12:23] and the Bible says that the serpent was
[1:12:26] more subtle
[1:12:28] than all of the beasts that word subtle
[1:12:32] you look at it in the subtlety that it
[1:12:35] had and the Bible says that the serpent
[1:12:38] was more subtle than all of the beasts
[1:12:40] the serpent was a title
[1:12:44] of an animal
[1:12:46] he was a beast he was an upright
[1:12:50] being that was as close to mankind that
[1:12:54] you could get
[1:12:56] now when I was in high school
[1:12:59] I studied anthropology
[1:13:02] I took classes
[1:13:04] about the
[1:13:06] ancestry of mankind where did we come
[1:13:09] from
[1:13:10] and you know all the theories about the
[1:13:14] theory of evolution and how that we came
[1:13:17] from a chimpanzee you've all seen the
[1:13:20] graph of the of the little chimpanzee in
[1:13:24] millions of years later and finally he
[1:13:27] comes upright as a man
[1:13:29] and they call him homo sapien
[1:13:33] and they say that he came from a beast
[1:13:36] well I want you to understand that God's
[1:13:39] word says and God's word is a law
[1:13:42] it is an absolute
[1:13:44] that law has never changed
[1:13:48] and he says that every seed will bring
[1:13:50] forth of its own kind
[1:13:53] and so forth therefore when God had a
[1:13:56] seed in the beginning there's no way
[1:13:58] that that seed if it is a pumpkin it
[1:14:02] cannot bring forth a watermelon
[1:14:08] if it is a wheat seed it cannot bring
[1:14:13] forth corn
[1:14:15] do you understand there's a law
[1:14:19] and so man who was made in His image
[1:14:23] and he was a seed and where do you plant
[1:14:25] seed
[1:14:26] but in a garden
[1:14:29] and so here was this the prophet of God
[1:14:32] said it was The Missing Link
[1:14:34] and he said here was uh uh he was a
[1:14:38] serpent that's his title do not think of
[1:14:41] a writhing animal a reptile do you not
[1:14:44] think that God knows the difference
[1:14:46] between a reptile and a beast
[1:14:49] it says and he was a beast but it says
[1:14:53] it wasn't until after the fall and
[1:14:56] because and he says okay serpent because
[1:14:59] thou has done this curse it shall you be
[1:15:02] and upon thy belly thou shall crawl and
[1:15:05] thus shall be your being
[1:15:07] and our brother James Whedon had made a
[1:15:10] uh him being a great artist he took that
[1:15:14] that manly Beast that uh a missing link
[1:15:19] and he showed the the morphing of it
[1:15:22] down into a serpent and upon his belly
[1:15:24] and the prophet of God said he changed
[1:15:27] that Missing Link so much that he said
[1:15:30] it's totally hid they're trying all of
[1:15:34] the anthropologists they're trying to
[1:15:36] find where is this missing link between
[1:15:39] man and animal
[1:15:41] and brother Branham said he was a beast
[1:15:44] and he was more subtle than all the
[1:15:47] peace and the spirit of the enemy
[1:15:50] Lucifer himself could get into that
[1:15:53] Beast let me give you a Biblical
[1:15:56] teaching
[1:15:57] the demonic spirits can get into animals
[1:16:02] do you understand
[1:16:05] even when the spirits and the days of
[1:16:07] Jesus were cast out and they were cast
[1:16:10] out into pigs
[1:16:12] even the pig
[1:16:14] had enough common sense to go and kill
[1:16:18] itself rather than live with a demonic
[1:16:21] Spirit of Oppression
[1:16:24] but the spirit of God will only enter
[1:16:27] into
[1:16:29] his own kind
[1:16:38] the devil has always tried to attack
[1:16:40] that
[1:16:42] which God will produce his seed through
[1:16:47] so he attacks the church the woman
[1:16:51] I want you all to understand that a man
[1:16:54] by a lot of biologically is a giver of
[1:16:58] seed
[1:17:00] but a woman biologically now today
[1:17:04] through
[1:17:06] education and educational nonsense
[1:17:11] they say there's other kinds of genders
[1:17:13] there's only two
[1:17:17] education tries to teach you otherwise
[1:17:21] but there's only male and female and
[1:17:23] when God instituted in the beginning a
[1:17:27] marriage it was Adam and Eve it was not
[1:17:31] Adam and Steve
[1:17:34] and I want you to understand
[1:17:36] that the devil whenever you come in and
[1:17:40] break God's pattern of how life should
[1:17:44] come it brings forth death
[1:17:46] so if you were to take two males and say
[1:17:49] well we marry them
[1:17:51] and they're married do you realize their
[1:17:54] marriage is seedless
[1:17:57] it cannot therefore there'll never be
[1:17:59] another generation after that
[1:18:02] you take two females
[1:18:05] and allow them to be married and and if
[1:18:08] that's what they want but do you realize
[1:18:10] it's death
[1:18:12] do you see anything to pervert God's
[1:18:15] word to change God's word of what he
[1:18:19] wanted from the very beginning is to
[1:18:22] bring forth death and that's what Satan
[1:18:24] did to Eve he used the channel of
[1:18:27] reasoning and he just talked to her a
[1:18:29] little bit
[1:18:30] that's the problem with people today is
[1:18:33] they eat from the Tree of knowledge and
[1:18:36] by their reasoning and well it's this
[1:18:38] way and it's that way and all of these
[1:18:40] great educated excuse me idiots
[1:18:48] how that they began they cannot you know
[1:18:53] we have women's rights
[1:18:55] the metoo movement women we have our
[1:18:58] rights
[1:18:59] just give it a six or eight months later
[1:19:01] and what is the woman can't define it
[1:19:10] the Bible says and they have lost their
[1:19:12] minds
[1:19:15] they have no gender identity I'll tell
[1:19:19] you my brother my sister there's only
[1:19:21] one way to find out where you come from
[1:19:24] that's to go back to your creator
[1:19:26] because he has the blueprint
[1:19:30] he knew how to put you together
[1:19:32] if you don't know read the instructions
[1:19:35] here it is and man was made in the image
[1:19:39] of God
[1:19:47] devil always attacks the woman knowing
[1:19:49] that the woman
[1:19:50] will receive seed
[1:19:53] and we know that a woman receives a seed
[1:19:55] of a man and when that seed that is
[1:19:59] given excuse me let's take the germ of
[1:20:01] life that comes from the mail
[1:20:04] when it connects to the seed that is in
[1:20:07] the female
[1:20:08] and it takes life
[1:20:11] whatever kind of life it was that that
[1:20:14] woman embraced that pregnated that seed
[1:20:17] she will multiply it
[1:20:20] and at the time of conception
[1:20:23] at the time when the sperm of the male
[1:20:27] enters into the Egg of the female
[1:20:29] there's a biological chemistry that
[1:20:33] takes place that the egg shuts off all
[1:20:36] other life
[1:20:40] it now begins to take
[1:20:43] and shield the life that has pregnated
[1:20:47] that seed
[1:20:49] and line upon line
[1:20:52] and sell upon cell it begins to
[1:20:55] reproduce itself
[1:20:57] it has no it it does not allow any other
[1:21:01] life in
[1:21:03] Hallelujah
[1:21:06] once God has conceived you
[1:21:09] once you have truly been born again and
[1:21:12] Jesus said my words are spirit and they
[1:21:15] are life
[1:21:16] and he that heareth my words and
[1:21:18] believeth on him shall have eternal life
[1:21:21] and his past from Death unto life
[1:21:25] but once you hear
[1:21:27] The Germ of life in God's words and it
[1:21:31] comes through the hearing of the ear
[1:21:33] which is the womb to the mind and comes
[1:21:37] Beyond now you can stop
[1:21:40] you can have a spermicide
[1:21:44] by the Mind by saying I don't believe it
[1:21:48] and no matter how good that life is
[1:21:52] it'll it'll it'll stop it
[1:21:55] it'll abort the life
[1:21:59] but if it can ever
[1:22:01] if there's no unbelief
[1:22:04] you understand the the devil's
[1:22:08] spermicide is unbelief and doubt
[1:22:12] but God
[1:22:14] rich in Mercy gives to every electric
[1:22:17] and ability
[1:22:20] to receive his life
[1:22:23] his seed
[1:22:25] my sheep
[1:22:27] hear my voice
[1:22:28] and a stranger they will not fall off he
[1:22:32] didn't say my sheep hear my religion
[1:22:35] it didn't say my sheep hear my Pope
[1:22:40] it says my sheep hear my voice
[1:22:43] God has got a voice
[1:22:46] and let me say this because the prophet
[1:22:48] of God tells you every one of you
[1:22:51] since your conception
[1:22:55] and I'm going to take it before
[1:22:58] I'm going to take it before conception
[1:23:02] you were already if I could say this
[1:23:05] we're conceived
[1:23:07] you were a being before you were
[1:23:10] conceived in the natural womb
[1:23:18] and because you were seed
[1:23:22] and because you were in God's mind
[1:23:25] and you were already there in the womb
[1:23:29] of his mind and therefore when he began
[1:23:32] to speak and he began to create that's
[1:23:35] why every one of you have been a spoken
[1:23:40] word created being
[1:23:44] now let me say that everybody on terra
[1:23:47] firma
[1:23:48] is not seed
[1:23:51] they are seed of some kind but they are
[1:23:53] not God's seed let me tell you a mystery
[1:23:56] about God's seed a mystery about God's
[1:23:59] seed is God has been watching over that
[1:24:01] seed since the before the foundation of
[1:24:04] the world God knows his he knows his own
[1:24:07] children
[1:24:08] and so God watches over that seed so it
[1:24:11] doesn't matter where that seed comes in
[1:24:14] the the chronology of time God is going
[1:24:18] to deal with each one of you
[1:24:21] individually this is not a collective
[1:24:24] Revelation this is that if you are a sea
[1:24:28] Gene of God you can go a very long time
[1:24:30] until you come across the idea of who
[1:24:34] you really are
[1:24:38] people go to church trying to find out
[1:24:41] who they are but unless there is a
[1:24:44] revealing word that is being being
[1:24:46] preached not seeing holy prayers not
[1:24:50] lighting candles that will never tell
[1:24:53] you who you are but when you come across
[1:24:56] a minister who is God ordained God God
[1:25:00] equipped God sent and he begins to
[1:25:04] preach God's word what happens there's
[1:25:07] something because God's word
[1:25:09] is being ministered and as it's being
[1:25:11] ministered something inside of you said
[1:25:13] I never heard that before
[1:25:16] but I say something
[1:25:18] in here Beyond here something in here
[1:25:22] says amen
[1:25:29] I was a long-haired dope smoking hippie
[1:25:36] if you would have judged the book by the
[1:25:39] outward cover
[1:25:40] you would have never wasted time
[1:25:44] don't ever judge a book by its cover
[1:25:50] but one day people told me about Jesus
[1:25:53] Christ
[1:25:54] to me Jesus Christ was a cuss word
[1:25:58] when my parents got angry guess what
[1:26:03] they didn't say oh Buddha
[1:26:06] they didn't say oh Confucius
[1:26:08] oh Muhammad
[1:26:12] because
[1:26:14] the devil wants to defame the name of
[1:26:18] God
[1:26:27] my parents were not religious didn't go
[1:26:29] to church
[1:26:34] I'd always wondered why
[1:26:37] other families would go to church never
[1:26:40] not one time not Christmas not Easter oh
[1:26:43] yeah we had a Christmas tree we had
[1:26:45] Easter eggs we did everything what the
[1:26:47] world did
[1:26:49] but it was just some religious thing and
[1:26:52] but one day I met Jesus Christ
[1:27:03] that's a young boy
[1:27:08] Mitch Buckingham you guys know Mitch
[1:27:10] Buckingham from up in Flagstaff
[1:27:13] I saw him we were up there Friday had a
[1:27:15] youth meeting up there and
[1:27:17] went to service after service Mitch
[1:27:20] grabbed my arm I said Mitch it was you
[1:27:24] it was you
[1:27:29] I said you told me about Jesus
[1:27:32] thank God somebody told me about Jesus
[1:27:35] didn't tell me about church
[1:27:37] he told me he said I'm a Christian well
[1:27:40] Mitch we're all Christians we're born in
[1:27:42] America America is a Christian Nation
[1:27:44] not no more
[1:27:49] he brought me to a Bible study
[1:27:52] you all know the story well anyway
[1:27:54] during that bible study
[1:27:56] it wound up at one of those times I gave
[1:27:59] my life to God I came out from that
[1:28:01] Bible study I remember that
[1:28:04] that Minister and you know what I
[1:28:06] enjoyed by that minister
[1:28:08] he loved God
[1:28:10] he was a denominational man but he loved
[1:28:13] God and you could see it in his
[1:28:15] sincerity Hollis Allen was his name
[1:28:19] and my he loved God and there's
[1:28:23] something about genuine Christians you
[1:28:25] can tell
[1:28:26] that they are not just living the way
[1:28:28] they live because they have to
[1:28:31] I don't live this life because I have to
[1:28:34] I'm happy to live this kind of like why
[1:28:37] because I'm in love
[1:28:39] there's something about people when
[1:28:41] they're in love
[1:28:47] I came out from that Bible study having
[1:28:49] given my life to Jesus Christ
[1:28:52] they led me in a little simple sinner's
[1:28:55] prayer
[1:28:57] do you accept Jesus Christ as your
[1:28:59] personal Lord and savior
[1:29:02] to forgive you of all your sins
[1:29:06] and I just he said repeat after me and I
[1:29:08] did and I'll tell you what I came out of
[1:29:11] there and I
[1:29:12] I was so excited
[1:29:15] I wasn't changed I wasn't uh but there
[1:29:18] was you know what you know what was
[1:29:20] changed my heart was she
[1:29:22] I came out of there and I was so excited
[1:29:24] we were walking down
[1:29:26] the street and the power lines were
[1:29:29] above us
[1:29:30] and we got to sing in and shout and just
[1:29:34] my brother and I and Mitch
[1:29:36] and I says I feel like it'd reach up and
[1:29:39] touch the top of those power lines
[1:29:42] I'm so excited
[1:29:44] because you know the Simplicity listen
[1:29:48] do you never lose the Simplicity of what
[1:29:51] it takes to be a Christian
[1:29:54] it's not hard it's not complicated quit
[1:29:57] trying to make it complicated you've got
[1:29:59] to do this you gotta do that you're
[1:30:00] gonna see stars you're gonna have some
[1:30:02] kind no some of you it'll be just a deep
[1:30:06] feeling inside of you it'll be a pull
[1:30:09] you can't explain it some of you might
[1:30:12] scream some of you might shout and the
[1:30:14] rest of you might just sit here and go
[1:30:16] oh God thank you for the revelation of
[1:30:20] your word
[1:30:23] we all act different we all have
[1:30:26] different mannerisms
[1:30:29] we all act differently so don't expect
[1:30:32] everybody to act just exactly the way
[1:30:34] you do otherwise you're going to have it
[1:30:36] unexpected
[1:30:38] fulfillment
[1:30:40] like well man you got so excited
[1:30:44] I didn't get excited yet I I did what
[1:30:47] you did yeah
[1:30:49] here's a miracle
[1:30:52] here's the miracle
[1:30:54] you reacted didn't you yes I did
[1:30:57] then then rejoice
[1:31:00] because the Bible says he that would
[1:31:04] receive him
[1:31:06] has eternal life
[1:31:08] and any man that comes unto me I will in
[1:31:11] no wise
[1:31:13] cast out is that right
[1:31:16] we try to wash everybody up make them a
[1:31:19] cookie cutter and they got to have this
[1:31:21] and everything's they're active listen
[1:31:23] let me tell you here's the real honest
[1:31:25] truth I still ain't got all my act
[1:31:28] together
[1:31:29] God has been washing me and cleaning me
[1:31:32] up and changing me and giving me perfect
[1:31:35] love and he's helping me and you know
[1:31:37] what I'm still I am I am a
[1:31:41] work in progress
[1:31:48] I know this brother Billy you know what
[1:31:50] I love him
[1:31:51] I love him with a fervancy and the
[1:31:55] reason that I do what I do is because
[1:31:57] I'm in love
[1:31:59] not because some law not because of fire
[1:32:02] insurance I don't go to church so I can
[1:32:05] have Heaven as my home
[1:32:07] no I fell in love with him
[1:32:10] I just fell in love
[1:32:14] with him
[1:32:16] sometimes we lose our simplicity
[1:32:20] of the Simplicity that's in Christ
[1:32:24] oh do you know what it's like to know
[1:32:26] God's love
[1:32:28] do you know what it's like to
[1:32:30] have him to love you listen the greatest
[1:32:33] Force there is in the world today is
[1:32:35] love
[1:32:39] brother Graham said when
[1:32:43] Divine love projects
[1:32:47] Sovereign Grace takes over
[1:32:49] do you know the time when God revealed
[1:32:53] to you his love
[1:32:56] and how overwhelming it was to you to
[1:32:59] feel and to know
[1:33:02] that God loves me
[1:33:06] he loves
[1:33:08] me
[1:33:11] I didn't know you loved me Lord
[1:33:14] I didn't know the story of calvary
[1:33:18] I didn't know that you went to the to
[1:33:20] the cross for my sins
[1:33:25] I didn't know that in Romans 3 23 that
[1:33:28] all have sinned and he's fallen short of
[1:33:30] the glory of God
[1:33:31] I didn't know that but all I knew
[1:33:34] was that I needed God and the wages of
[1:33:38] sin is death but the gift
[1:33:42] of God is eternal life through Jesus
[1:33:46] Christ
[1:33:48] wages is something you earn
[1:33:51] if you go to hell you earned your way
[1:33:56] if you go to heaven
[1:33:59] it's by grace are you safe
[1:34:02] it's not works of righteousness we lose
[1:34:05] our Simplicity that's in Christ
[1:34:08] it's not about you
[1:34:11] it's about him
[1:34:16] that's why Paul said I have espoused you
[1:34:20] to one husband and I Fearless by any
[1:34:23] means
[1:34:24] by theologians by false preachers
[1:34:28] by seducers
[1:34:30] by false prophets who come in here and
[1:34:33] preach to you another Jesus
[1:34:36] and preach to you another gospel
[1:34:45] Paul did not espouse you to the
[1:34:47] messenger
[1:34:51] he did not espouse you to a church
[1:34:56] or to the prophet
[1:34:59] but he engaged you to Christ himself
[1:35:06] God hides himself in simplicity
[1:35:09] he hides himself into intellectual
[1:35:13] from the wise and the prudent
[1:35:16] Jesus said I thank thee Father in Heaven
[1:35:19] because thou has hid these things
[1:35:21] from the wise and the prudent
[1:35:23] and revealed them to babes
[1:35:26] now I've told you this before but we
[1:35:28] have some visitors here so let me say
[1:35:30] this
[1:35:32] the word babes is a compound word
[1:35:36] in Greek
[1:35:38] and he revealed it unto babes such as
[1:35:41] would learn babes napiers
[1:35:46] Napier and EOS
[1:35:50] a child that came by way of spoken word
[1:35:57] a spoken
[1:36:00] word child
[1:36:02] because the spoken word
[1:36:06] is the original
[1:36:09] seed
[1:36:11] I'm going slow let this drop in
[1:36:14] the spoken word is the Original Seed so
[1:36:20] you hid it from Weiss and prudent
[1:36:23] and revealed it to spoken word children
[1:36:28] that's why my brother my sister
[1:36:30] you can have
[1:36:32] the books and the tapes of the prophet
[1:36:37] excuse me you can have the tapes the
[1:36:39] books of the Prophet that's great that's
[1:36:41] wonderful you all should have that
[1:36:44] but unless God reveals to you
[1:36:49] what this message is all about let me
[1:36:51] tell you what it's about
[1:36:54] it's about Jesus Christ
[1:36:58] revealed
[1:37:00] in simplicity
[1:37:04] he's not three gods
[1:37:08] he's one God
[1:37:10] and he's revealed in three offices
[1:37:13] Father Son and Holy Spirit
[1:37:16] but these three are
[1:37:18] one
[1:37:20] I'm a father
[1:37:22] and I'm a son and I'm a human being
[1:37:25] those are titles of offices that I hold
[1:37:31] but that's not my name
[1:37:34] what is the name of the father Son and
[1:37:37] Holy Ghost there's only one name given
[1:37:40] among men whereby we must be saved let's
[1:37:43] let's talk about simplicity
[1:37:46] there's only one name there's only one
[1:37:48] mediator between God and man who is it
[1:37:50] it's Jesus Christ
[1:37:55] nobody
[1:37:57] what is the name
[1:37:59] of the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:38:03] there's only one name given among men
[1:38:06] what is it Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:10] I remember over there in Vietnam and I
[1:38:12] had a bunch of ministers all
[1:38:14] denominational ministers and we were
[1:38:16] preaching the message of the hour and I
[1:38:18] came across this doctrinal teaching thy
[1:38:22] said no one in your Bible was ever
[1:38:23] baptized in the name father son only
[1:38:25] ghost
[1:38:27] oh oh one denominational Minister stood
[1:38:30] up
[1:38:32] now he's speaking his Vietnamese I said
[1:38:35] hey
[1:38:37] this is my meeting
[1:38:40] hold your peace
[1:38:43] I said we'll talk about this later I
[1:38:45] said if you can find I said he says no
[1:38:49] no no wait a minute wait a minute I I
[1:38:52] know I find I find I find I said no you
[1:38:54] won't find it but I said so I'm not
[1:38:56] going to waste time
[1:38:57] I said you go home tonight you find me
[1:39:00] tomorrow when we have our ministers
[1:39:01] meeting find me where it was written
[1:39:04] anyone baptized in the name of father
[1:39:06] son Holy Ghost yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
[1:39:09] okay
[1:39:10] he comes back the next day now now watch
[1:39:12] this
[1:39:13] sometimes the one who is the most
[1:39:16] argumentative
[1:39:18] who is the one who is the most
[1:39:20] persecuting
[1:39:22] who is like Saul even unto death because
[1:39:26] they're just religious
[1:39:29] do you see
[1:39:31] so the next morning he comes
[1:39:33] and it's so funny because we start to
[1:39:35] meeting hey hey hey me say something
[1:39:38] like this he said you right you're right
[1:39:42] no one
[1:39:43] it is and then and
[1:39:46] the guy who was the worst the hardest
[1:39:50] the most strange against us yes I will
[1:39:53] show you that's wrong what you're
[1:39:54] teaching is not right and now he said no
[1:39:57] I know it's true what is the name of
[1:40:00] father son Holy Ghost it's Lord Jesus
[1:40:02] Christ yes everyone in Bible baptized in
[1:40:05] the name of Jesus Christ I said okay
[1:40:07] good you got it and sit down
[1:40:13] because once God reveals to you that
[1:40:15] guess what you've got another Revelation
[1:40:17] coming again after that guess what these
[1:40:20] Revelations that are coming to you
[1:40:21] they're going to keep coming and guess
[1:40:24] what God is so great he is so infinite
[1:40:26] he is so omnipotent that guess what that
[1:40:29] throughout eternity
[1:40:31] in God's Great IMAX in heaven
[1:40:36] and you and your pillowy lazy boy chair
[1:40:41] we'll sit back and watch in God's Great
[1:40:45] Cosmos
[1:40:48] and he will begin to unfold himself
[1:40:51] and we will just sit there in our mouths
[1:40:54] will be open and our whole eyes will be
[1:40:57] wide and we'll be going
[1:40:59] wow
[1:41:06] oh that's how he did it
[1:41:08] that's simple
[1:41:13] my brother my sister the Simplicity of
[1:41:15] the Gospel
[1:41:16] the whole central theme of this Bible
[1:41:19] is that God is revealed in simplicity
[1:41:23] and that Simplicity must not be made
[1:41:26] complex it must not be preached into
[1:41:29] intellectual isms and all kinds of
[1:41:33] theological this and that no you know
[1:41:36] what saints of God
[1:41:38] when I go into other countries and I
[1:41:40] preach the gospel and and perhaps they
[1:41:43] have never known
[1:41:45] anything about the message of the hour
[1:41:48] and they have no concept do you think I
[1:41:51] tried to go up there and teach them all
[1:41:53] of the deep doctrinal things no you know
[1:41:55] what I do I start with my testimony
[1:41:58] I start about how that God got a hold of
[1:42:00] my life and changed my life and
[1:42:02] everything listen people can argue with
[1:42:04] you all day on Doctrine
[1:42:08] but they can't your testimony
[1:42:10] so tell them how your candle got lit
[1:42:16] let your light shine
[1:42:20] because you know what your testimony is
[1:42:22] the illumination that God gave to you
[1:42:27] and they may not like you they may not
[1:42:29] like your Doctrine they may not like the
[1:42:32] way you look you might be a threat to
[1:42:34] them you might bring to them
[1:42:37] some kind of guilt
[1:42:40] condemnation you don't even have to say
[1:42:43] it who do you think you are you think
[1:42:46] you're more holy than I am
[1:42:48] no I didn't say that
[1:42:51] but what happens is the spirit of God
[1:42:53] who's in me convicts their heart and
[1:42:56] they feel bad
[1:43:02] amen
[1:43:04] God is hidden in simple things
[1:43:08] I'm only impeached too
[1:43:11] I told you that this is going to evolve
[1:43:16] in the sermon Divine love let me show
[1:43:18] you a few quotes
[1:43:19] sermon Divine love
[1:43:21] God does things in such simple ways
[1:43:26] I think many times how people lose the
[1:43:29] very meaning is because God does things
[1:43:32] so simple
[1:43:34] men are looking for some great some
[1:43:36] great thing to take place when God
[1:43:38] dwells in simplicity
[1:43:42] and the next quote brother REM says God
[1:43:44] hiding himself in simplicity
[1:43:48] it is strange to think that God does
[1:43:50] such things as that
[1:43:52] God will hide himself in something so
[1:43:54] simple that'll cause the wise to miss it
[1:43:57] a million miles and then turn right back
[1:44:00] around in that some simple thing in the
[1:44:04] Simplicity is his way of working and
[1:44:06] revealing himself out again
[1:44:10] I thought he made it a text that it
[1:44:12] might study uh this before we get into
[1:44:14] the great teaching of the Seven Seals so
[1:44:16] it's important listen to this
[1:44:18] here he is I made this study before we
[1:44:21] get into the seals
[1:44:23] many times we miss him by the way he
[1:44:25] reveals himself
[1:44:27] now man has their own ideas on what God
[1:44:31] ought to be and what God is going to do
[1:44:33] and as I have made the old statement
[1:44:35] many times that man Still Remains man
[1:44:38] is always giving God praise for what he
[1:44:42] did do and always looking forward to
[1:44:45] what he will do and ignoring
[1:44:47] what he's doing
[1:44:52] paragraph 28
[1:44:54] same sermon when God is just about to do
[1:44:58] something
[1:44:59] to deliver his people God sends a
[1:45:01] message to the people and it's so simple
[1:45:04] as we'll catch in the breaking of these
[1:45:06] seals
[1:45:07] that was my purpose
[1:45:10] of bringing this first
[1:45:16] that we find out that the breaking of
[1:45:18] those seals
[1:45:20] is so simple
[1:45:23] the smart miss it a million miles
[1:45:29] so which one of you want to say well I
[1:45:32] I'm I'm a genius I'm a I'm a brain I'm
[1:45:35] an intellectual you'll miss it a million
[1:45:37] miles
[1:45:40] Lord let me
[1:45:44] let me be ignorant
[1:45:47] if you please enough
[1:45:50] to say
[1:45:52] teach me
[1:45:56] teach me thy ways o God
[1:45:59] otherwise I'll miss it a million miles
[1:46:03] do you know the prophet of God also said
[1:46:05] and this is a very good quote
[1:46:08] he said those who are susceptible to
[1:46:10] demon Spirits are highly intellectual
[1:46:16] that's why some of you will never be
[1:46:18] bothered by that
[1:46:22] I don't mean to be a put down
[1:46:24] you ought to rejoice
[1:46:26] if you're just a simple person you're
[1:46:28] going to say thank God that'll never
[1:46:29] bother me man
[1:46:31] the rest of you are highly intellectual
[1:46:33] and think a lot and everything some of
[1:46:35] you I would hate to be your brain
[1:46:38] because you think about this well what
[1:46:40] about this and how is this and why they
[1:46:42] do that and what if we do and when we
[1:46:43] get there and what is it going to be
[1:46:45] like
[1:46:46] shut up
[1:46:51] it'll never be the way you think it will
[1:46:53] be when you get there
[1:46:59] so why waste the energy
[1:47:02] we'll cross that bridge when we come to
[1:47:04] it most of the time you never come to
[1:47:05] the bridge
[1:47:15] ah the economy
[1:47:16] do I invest in gold
[1:47:19] how about silver how about Bitcoin
[1:47:21] man I'll tell you what on YouTube it's
[1:47:24] been saying all this kind of stuff if
[1:47:25] you Hey listen if you follow all of this
[1:47:27] stuff on YouTube You're Gonna Go Crazy
[1:47:33] you're gonna you're gonna try to become
[1:47:36] some hermit up on top of a hill
[1:47:38] somewhere
[1:47:39] learning how to eat cactus
[1:47:45] and be a Survivor listen I'm not I'm not
[1:47:47] here to survive
[1:47:49] I'm here to overcome
[1:47:51] I'm not surviving louder you see you I'm
[1:47:54] overcoming it guess what I ain't gonna
[1:47:56] be here I don't huh no don't don't sit
[1:47:59] there well I need to hoard up for hey
[1:48:01] it's all going to fall apart praise God
[1:48:03] all I know this I know this Elijah
[1:48:06] didn't have to figure it out when God
[1:48:09] told him to go by the book The Brook and
[1:48:12] delay and he would send Ravens to feed
[1:48:15] him
[1:48:16] huh
[1:48:19] I wonder if Elijah was so intellectual
[1:48:21] he said well what kind of Raven is it
[1:48:22] going to be
[1:48:24] hey
[1:48:25] uh where does he get the food
[1:48:28] is his beak cleaned
[1:48:32] how often is it going to bring it
[1:48:36] right
[1:48:39] I never seen that Raven before
[1:48:41] how do I know who he is
[1:48:44] I mean you know what all he did was
[1:48:47] allow God huh because he says I have
[1:48:50] commanded Ravens
[1:48:53] I don't care what happens
[1:48:56] God will command something somebody
[1:49:00] he told you he told Elijah I have
[1:49:03] commanded a widow woman
[1:49:06] no glory I've commanded a widow woman to
[1:49:10] sustain thee and guess what she's dying
[1:49:14] her and her son are dying a little bit
[1:49:17] of oil a little Cruise of oil and a
[1:49:21] little barrel of meal
[1:49:23] and Elijah had the audacity
[1:49:27] make me a cake first
[1:49:30] who Do You Think You Are
[1:49:35] can't you see them
[1:49:37] to look at us
[1:49:40] I'm gonna take this sticks and mix up
[1:49:43] this oil and
[1:49:44] we're gonna eat and die
[1:49:48] imagine their bodies were emaciated
[1:49:54] she was speaking the truth we're gonna
[1:49:55] die
[1:49:58] he said make me
[1:50:00] mine first
[1:50:02] you know what sometimes God will ask you
[1:50:04] make me mine first
[1:50:09] some of you it's hard for you to pay
[1:50:10] tithes you say well you know I get so
[1:50:12] many bills you give God your tithing
[1:50:15] first and watch him provide on the rest
[1:50:17] of that
[1:50:19] he says in one fact it's a one of the
[1:50:22] few times he says prove me
[1:50:27] here's another thing when people start
[1:50:30] having an issue in Doctrine and problems
[1:50:33] in church and they're having unbelief
[1:50:36] come in their life
[1:50:38] the first thing they use to quit is
[1:50:40] tithing
[1:50:44] that's a fact
[1:50:56] losing our simplicity
[1:50:59] Paul said I Fearless by any means
[1:51:02] that the same serpent the beguiled Eve
[1:51:06] will come in here and he will seduce
[1:51:09] your minds
[1:51:11] you know how he does it works
[1:51:14] God uses words
[1:51:17] and Satan use his words
[1:51:23] sticks and stones may break my bones but
[1:51:28] words will never hurt me are you kidding
[1:51:31] me
[1:51:32] huh
[1:51:33] I don't know why my mother taught me
[1:51:36] that because that's a lie
[1:51:38] I don't like sticks and stones and yeah
[1:51:40] they can break your bones but words
[1:51:42] really affect me
[1:51:44] and some of you are really affected
[1:51:47] by words
[1:51:48] if somebody makes fun of you huh you
[1:51:51] look like a grandma and you're only 18.
[1:52:00] it affects you
[1:52:02] if you're a follower
[1:52:04] if you're worried about what everybody
[1:52:06] thinks don't be a Christian
[1:52:09] because you know what being a Christian
[1:52:10] is not going to be popular
[1:52:14] huh in fact it's going to become more
[1:52:16] and more unpopular to the point it will
[1:52:20] cause a persecution
[1:52:23] the Bible says and they that live Godly
[1:52:25] in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:52:28] and we're seeing it coming on and on and
[1:52:31] on huh you can start a Satanist Club in
[1:52:34] school
[1:52:36] you can you can talk and have a club for
[1:52:39] Satan you can sing songs to Satan and
[1:52:43] you know you have your right but your
[1:52:45] children cannot quote scripture they
[1:52:48] can't take a Bible to school they can't
[1:52:51] testify about Christ
[1:52:54] oh we got it so upside down
[1:53:04] you can never have Christ Living in your
[1:53:06] life unless you're first accepted his
[1:53:09] word into your heart
[1:53:13] you will never backslide away from God
[1:53:15] until you believe a lie of the enemy
[1:53:18] you will never take off into false
[1:53:21] Doctrine until some Slicker talks you
[1:53:23] into it
[1:53:25] seducing spirits
[1:53:27] brother Brahm said I will identify what
[1:53:29] seducing Spirits are in the end time and
[1:53:31] he said they're seducing clergy
[1:53:37] that's what he said
[1:53:40] that's why in Psalms 119 wherewithal
[1:53:43] shall a young man cleanse his way by
[1:53:45] taking heed therein too Thy word and
[1:53:49] with all
[1:53:50] and with the whole heart have I sought
[1:53:53] thee oh let me not Wander from thy
[1:53:55] Commandments Thy word have I hid in my
[1:53:57] heart
[1:53:59] that I might not sin against thee
[1:54:02] where did he hide the word
[1:54:04] his heart
[1:54:07] did you realize the most
[1:54:10] prized possession that you have the most
[1:54:13] absolutely
[1:54:16] most precious thing that you have
[1:54:19] is your heart
[1:54:24] you ever had somebody talk to you
[1:54:27] and they all of a sudden start getting
[1:54:28] all choked up and teared up and they
[1:54:30] said hey
[1:54:33] I'm talking from my heart right now
[1:54:37] and all of a sudden
[1:54:40] the eyes get teared up
[1:54:42] The Voice
[1:54:46] gets a little shaken
[1:54:48] I'm talking from my heart
[1:54:51] do you see the greatest gift that you
[1:54:53] could give God
[1:54:56] is your heart
[1:54:59] you see it's not coming to him and
[1:55:01] cleaning up the outside and getting all
[1:55:04] of your act together that's what
[1:55:05] pharisynical religion does Pharisee
[1:55:09] religion washes the outside of the cup
[1:55:12] and does nothing to the inside
[1:55:15] but true Christianity is simple
[1:55:18] Jesus on the inside working on the
[1:55:22] outside
[1:55:23] oh what a change in my life
[1:55:28] nobody has to tell you it happens he
[1:55:30] tells you
[1:55:32] when I had my long hair
[1:55:36] and I came to
[1:55:37] one of the tape services
[1:55:44] I'll tell you what happened I I walked
[1:55:46] by my mirror
[1:55:48] that's what I did I walked by my mirror
[1:55:50] now my mother and father my father
[1:55:52] especially is a cowboy
[1:55:55] he hated long hair on me you pervert
[1:55:59] he hated long hair
[1:56:01] they forced me to cut my hair all the
[1:56:03] way through High School
[1:56:05] so I told him I said I'll tell you what
[1:56:06] I get out okay while I'm here I'll do
[1:56:09] what you want me to do uh yeah okay
[1:56:12] but when I get out of school I'm going
[1:56:14] to grow my hair long now I'm going to do
[1:56:16] what I want you ain't gonna tell me what
[1:56:17] to do
[1:56:18] so I did
[1:56:21] grew my hair long
[1:56:23] you know my father said don't you come
[1:56:25] around my house with that long perverted
[1:56:27] hair
[1:56:29] so the first Christmas come by and I'd
[1:56:32] only had the hair had only grown out
[1:56:34] several months
[1:56:36] I thought they had long hair and it was
[1:56:38] just oh yes it was a beetle haircut
[1:56:43] he called up he said are are you coming
[1:56:46] home for Christmas
[1:56:48] I got long hair
[1:56:52] yeah well
[1:56:54] come home and see us anyway
[1:56:57] all right so if you don't love me with
[1:56:59] long hair you don't love me
[1:57:01] let me say this to all of you
[1:57:03] none of us should ever be so
[1:57:05] self-righteous that we want to make
[1:57:07] people
[1:57:08] do what we want them to do without God
[1:57:11] cleaning them up from the inside
[1:57:15] I walked by a mirror that day and I
[1:57:18] don't know what it was brother Mike I
[1:57:19] walked by a mirror and guess what I
[1:57:21] looked at my reflection I had long hair
[1:57:23] the Bible says it does not nature itself
[1:57:25] teach you
[1:57:26] that it's a shame for a man to have long
[1:57:29] hair
[1:57:30] yeah but Jesus said longer
[1:57:32] right
[1:57:33] you've heard that
[1:57:34] Jesus said longer how long is long how
[1:57:37] short is short
[1:57:39] well I got convicted
[1:57:41] I'm not going to cut my hair
[1:57:43] if God can't love me with long hair I'm
[1:57:46] telling my heavenly father the same
[1:57:48] thing I told my Earthly pot
[1:57:50] if you can't let me with long hair then
[1:57:52] you can't love me okay I'll be ashamed
[1:57:54] of my long hair but I'm not gonna cut it
[1:57:58] God knows just what to do
[1:58:06] he even fixed it enough to where he said
[1:58:09] you won't even have any hair to grow
[1:58:11] anymore
[1:58:16] I'm jealous of some of you guys
[1:58:20] you got all that long hair on top of
[1:58:22] your I mean you know this nice full head
[1:58:24] of here
[1:58:29] watch this
[1:58:34] you see the hair going
[1:58:36] I don't know why I'm saying this but
[1:58:38] what happened
[1:58:39] what happened nobody told me to cut my
[1:58:41] hair
[1:58:42] these were just a bunch of hippies
[1:58:46] just a bunch of common
[1:58:48] kids that got converted
[1:58:50] the Simplicity in Christ
[1:58:53] nobody told me
[1:58:56] but the Holy Spirit convicted me so I
[1:58:58] went
[1:59:00] and I cut my hair
[1:59:02] and I really thought I chopped it all
[1:59:04] off and I had done God a service
[1:59:08] so I walk in I happened to be late I'm
[1:59:11] very seldom ever late to anything but I
[1:59:13] walk in late the tape's already planned
[1:59:17] I walk in and everything and I I walk
[1:59:19] around I want to shake hands with
[1:59:20] everybody
[1:59:24] nobody says anything
[1:59:27] I hated it
[1:59:29] it bothered me I thought hey I went over
[1:59:31] and turned off the tape
[1:59:33] yeah David I had the audition turn off
[1:59:37] the tape hey
[1:59:38] isn't anybody gonna thank me for cutting
[1:59:41] my hair
[1:59:44] one brother said no we expected it and
[1:59:46] I'll shut up and turn the tape back on
[1:59:51] I want to ask you whose disciple was I
[1:59:53] then
[1:59:54] was I Christ
[1:59:57] because no man told me
[2:00:00] you see the Simplicity the Gospel of
[2:00:02] Jesus Christ
[2:00:04] I'm afraid this lady means we lose our
[2:00:07] simplicity
[2:00:09] of God revealing himself through his
[2:00:11] word and the only Divine revealer of
[2:00:15] God's word is the Holy Spirit The Gospel
[2:00:19] is real simple
[2:00:22] I'll tell you what we should be a church
[2:00:25] that never looks down our noses at
[2:00:29] anyone else that is out there
[2:00:32] before they have a right to hear the
[2:00:35] gospel the same as you
[2:00:40] sometimes I think we get self-righteous
[2:00:49] the Bible says in Romans 8 verses 5 and
[2:00:51] 9.
[2:00:52] for they that are after The Flesh do
[2:00:55] them do mine the things of the flesh
[2:01:00] and they that are after the spirit the
[2:01:02] things of the spirit
[2:01:05] for to be carnally minded is death
[2:01:09] do you see that
[2:01:11] carnally minded his death but to be
[2:01:13] spiritually minded is life and peace
[2:01:17] but Conley the carnal mind is enmity
[2:01:20] with God in other words it's opposing
[2:01:24] forces
[2:01:26] huh
[2:01:29] have any of you ever played with really
[2:01:32] strong magnets
[2:01:33] huh and you get them together and if
[2:01:36] they're polarized in the right direction
[2:01:37] guess what they do
[2:01:39] man they snapped together real quick and
[2:01:41] you have to pull them apart and you play
[2:01:43] with them and back together and you all
[2:01:46] this kind of stuff you play with magnets
[2:01:48] but what if you turn it the opposite
[2:01:50] direction
[2:01:52] what happens
[2:01:54] huh
[2:01:56] they're polarized
[2:01:58] do you see that somebody with a carnal
[2:02:01] mind is polarized to the things of God I
[2:02:05] need to stop at
[2:02:10] carnally minded
[2:02:12] brother Brown said you want to win a
[2:02:14] sinner
[2:02:15] taking fishing
[2:02:19] taking fishing what's fishing got to do
[2:02:22] with the gospel
[2:02:24] well because when you're out there let
[2:02:26] your presence
[2:02:28] saints of God I I would love to have
[2:02:30] every one of you to be winners
[2:02:33] of of others to Christ because you live
[2:02:38] a life that they like the way you live
[2:02:41] and that they look at you and they see
[2:02:43] oh man this guy he's happy about what he
[2:02:46] he likes
[2:02:48] huh he enjoys it he enjoys going to
[2:02:52] church you don't have to force him to go
[2:02:54] to church you don't have to force him to
[2:02:57] be early you don't have to force him hey
[2:02:59] get in there and put on the right
[2:03:00] clothes get in there oh little sis let
[2:03:03] me tell you take that short dress off
[2:03:06] well I'll tell you that when I
[2:03:09] it wasn't because they're in love
[2:03:12] I'll tell you what saints of God the
[2:03:14] reason that I am what I am as I fell in
[2:03:17] love
[2:03:23] you want to know the real simple truth
[2:03:30] that's the reason I live the way that I
[2:03:33] do and I don't try to make others
[2:03:36] see it or do it the way that I do I wait
[2:03:39] and let God show them
[2:03:42] but I preach to you truth
[2:03:45] and I think saints of God you know what
[2:03:47] we miss great opportunities
[2:03:51] to tell somebody else about Jesus Christ

[2:06:55] but it was life affecting
[2:07:00] ah
[2:07:01] God why are we losing our simplicity

[2:07:12] man I love going to church and I love
[2:07:15] being there and I love everybody and
[2:07:17] I've learned to shut my mouth and say
[2:07:19] only good things and quit uh huh quit
[2:07:23] talking about this one and then if
[2:07:24] there's anybody that you have to talk to
[2:07:27] about somebody else talk to Jesus

[2:07:43] minutes
[2:07:46] I'm only on page four
[2:07:48] that's okay
[2:07:55] I think saints of God we've tried to
[2:07:58] make this message
[2:08:04] it's simple
[2:08:06] man it is simple
[2:08:13] there is never a sermon but what I put
[2:08:15] on with brother Brenham and the whole
[2:08:17] central theme of the sermon is Jesus
[2:08:20] Christ
[2:08:25] the Apostle Paul
[2:08:27] I'm gonna I'm gonna go to this and then
[2:08:29] I'm going to close
[2:08:34] you Brethren find the quote in First
[2:08:36] Corinthians chapter two I'm going to

[2:08:44] Corinthians 2 verses one through eight
[2:08:46] let me just tell you something this age
[2:08:49] is a complex age is it not
[2:08:51] huh now look I am not a mechanic and I'm
[2:08:55] not really mechanically minded but I
[2:08:58] bought a 1956 Chevrolet three-quarter
[2:09:01] ton pickup and I used to raise up the
[2:09:04] hood and you saw the battery and the
[2:09:06] engine and the radiator and that's it
[2:09:12] when I worked on that I could raise up
[2:09:15] the hood I could actually sit in the
[2:09:17] engine compartment area and work on the
[2:09:20] engine
[2:09:22] it was simple
[2:09:25] wasn't complex
[2:09:28] I bought a car the other day I raised
[2:09:30] the hood
[2:09:34] I could agree
[2:09:36] I want to change the oil can't
[2:09:40] I didn't does it have points I don't
[2:09:42] know is there a carburetor I don't know
[2:09:45] I couldn't find it to tell you anyway
[2:09:48] it's too complex so you have to take it
[2:09:50] in you buy a new car guess what you
[2:09:52] can't work on it
[2:09:54] you have to take it in why how about a
[2:09:56] cell phone I think it's complex
[2:09:59] just about the time I'm I got my flip
[2:10:04] phone
[2:10:04] to where I could get it to work properly
[2:10:07] and I knew what guess what then my kid's

[2:11:13] process
[2:11:20] [Music]
[2:11:24] what I thought would be simple
[2:11:27] became complex
[2:11:32] now I'm going to show you
[2:11:36] First Corinthians chapter two and I want
[2:11:39] to say this in closing
[2:11:41] and again I haven't even really gone to
[2:11:43] the area of
[2:11:45] that I want to and maybe I'll close with
[2:11:47] a quote directly from Brother Branham
[2:11:50] but in First Corinthians chapter two
[2:11:53] if you want to turn in your Bibles you
[2:11:54] may
[2:11:56] foreign
[2:11:59] do you have it yeah and I brethren
[2:12:03] when I came to you came not with the
[2:12:05] Excellency of speech
[2:12:08] or of wisdom
[2:12:11] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[2:12:16] but I determined not to know anything
[2:12:21] among you
[2:12:24] save Jesus Christ
[2:12:26] and him crucified
[2:12:30] wow wow wait Paul
[2:12:34] he who was caught up into the heavens
[2:12:38] he who had the greatest abundance
[2:12:42] of Revelation in his hour a man it was
[2:12:45] hard to be understood
[2:12:49] said I
[2:12:52] and determined to know
[2:12:55] only one thing
[2:12:57] I'm going to condense my whole message
[2:12:59] into one thing I know Jesus Christ
[2:13:10] wow
[2:13:12] he says I am a Pharisee of Pharisees
[2:13:17] circumcised at the Eighth Day of the
[2:13:19] tribe of Benjamin
[2:13:22] concerning the law I was blameless
[2:13:26] I am a Hebrew
[2:13:28] of Hebrews
[2:13:30] And yet when he came to Christ he said
[2:13:33] all of my former learning
[2:13:37] is done
[2:13:40] that I might know Christ
[2:13:42] have we lost our Simplicity of what this
[2:13:45] message is all about
[2:13:48] all right
[2:13:50] do you know it's easy to become a
[2:13:52] Christian
[2:13:53] it's easy you just have to give your
[2:13:56] life to Jesus Christ don't make it
[2:13:58] complex
[2:14:00] it's not hard to serve Jesus Christ
[2:14:03] musicians if you come
[2:14:07] no it's easy to be a Christian it's hard
[2:14:10] to be a sinner
[2:14:12] huh
[2:14:14] it is it's hard to be a sinner
[2:14:21] the Bible says that we have a
[2:14:22] transgressor is hard
[2:14:25] oh huh
[2:14:27] it's hard
[2:14:30] but he says to anyone that wants
[2:14:33] can come unto me
[2:14:36] if you come unto me I will in no wise
[2:14:38] cast you out
[2:14:45] wow
[2:14:46] I thought that I've got to cut my hair
[2:14:49] I've got to quit doing all of my bad
[2:14:51] stuff and I gotta be righteous enough
[2:14:53] that when I come to church he'll accept
[2:14:55] me
[2:14:57] where'd you get that
[2:15:03] he's at the
[2:15:05] well one day and there's an ill-famed
[2:15:08] woman
[2:15:11] isn't it amazing how many times he was
[2:15:13] caught around ill-famed women
[2:15:15] [Music]
[2:15:19] give me a drink
[2:15:23] it's not customary
[2:15:25] [Music]
[2:15:26] you know what kind of woman I am I have
[2:15:28] to come here at a certain time of day
[2:15:29] because I can't come with the virgins
[2:15:36] do you think that his discernment wasn't
[2:15:39] working that morning
[2:15:40] [Music]
[2:15:41] do you think that oh I made a mistake
[2:15:43] excuse me you're right
[2:15:50] woman if you knew who it was that'd ask
[2:15:52] you to give you a drink
[2:15:55] you would ask him
[2:15:58] [Music]
[2:16:01] and he would give you
[2:16:03] water that you cannot come here to get
[2:16:07] who are you you don't even have a vessel
[2:16:11] to put down how are you going to get
[2:16:13] this water
[2:16:14] if you would ask of me to give you of
[2:16:16] this water I'll give you water that you
[2:16:19] do not
[2:16:21] [Music]
[2:16:27] oh
[2:16:31] but the key word that she said was give
[2:16:34] me of this water
[2:16:37] you see how simple that was you see the
[2:16:39] Simplicity brother Gabriel if you're
[2:16:41] going to do something for God give me
[2:16:42] just just give it to me do you really
[2:16:45] want it yeah give me this water and he
[2:16:48] began to give her
[2:16:50] a well springing up with inside of her
[2:16:53] was she completely changed was she was
[2:16:57] her dress immediately all of a sudden
[2:16:59] now it was long or her hair no
[2:17:03] but he loved her
[2:17:05] I want you to understand let God love
[2:17:09] his people he will change him
[2:17:12] I told her brother yesterday
[2:17:15] I said I I bought a t-shirt to take to
[2:17:18] South Africa no to Zimbabwe
[2:17:22] it said Simon Peters fishing
[2:17:27] um
[2:17:27] Fishing Company Simon Peters Fishing
[2:17:31] Company
[2:17:33] I catch him he cleans them
[2:17:38] [Music]
[2:17:39] here I am I'm Simon Peter
[2:17:43] and I'm going fishing
[2:17:44] [Music]
[2:17:46] and you know what I do when I fish I
[2:17:48] fish for men because Jesus said come
[2:17:51] I'll make you Fishers of Men
[2:17:54] [Music]
[2:17:58] you will never catch somebody
[2:18:02] into what you want them to see until God
[2:18:06] opens their eyes and they see it and if
[2:18:09] they don't see what something that they
[2:18:12] admire or they look to they don't want
[2:18:14] it
[2:18:17] father would you allow every one of our
[2:18:20] lives
[2:18:23] to be a living example of you that we
[2:18:26] enjoy being a Christian
[2:18:30] I love it
[2:18:32] Even If Heaven
[2:18:35] is not real
[2:18:37] even if I never get a mansion
[2:18:41] even if I never walk on streets of gold
[2:18:46] [Music]
[2:18:49] I love you father
[2:18:53] and this is good enough
[2:18:57] have a relationship between you and I
[2:19:01] know you
[2:19:03] in the power of your Resurrection
[2:19:06] in the simplicity
[2:19:09] in the Simplicity that was found in
[2:19:12] Christ
[2:19:13] because when I came into Christ I found
[2:19:16] out it was the identified Christ of all
[2:19:19] the ages
[2:19:20] I found out that really that's who it's
[2:19:22] been it's been Christ it was Christ and
[2:19:24] David it was Christ in Jeremiah it was
[2:19:27] Christ and all of these what was it
[2:19:29] Christ the spirit of God
[2:19:32] when the spirit of God moves you do not
[2:19:34] need to beg people to come
[2:19:37] come to the altar
[2:19:40] sometimes I think what we do is we beg
[2:19:42] we plead we we ask come and there's a
[2:19:45] time for that there is a time for that
[2:19:47] I'm going to show you
[2:19:49] a quote that I'm going to launch off
[2:19:51] into something to help you understand
[2:19:53] maybe the direction even the prophet was
[2:19:56] trying to get us to understand something
[2:19:58] wait just a moment let me find the quote
[2:20:05] [Music]
[2:20:09] thank you
[2:20:12] in fact my wife and I were in
[2:20:15] [Music]
[2:20:16] and we were listening to a tape
[2:20:25] I find this
[2:20:27] I sent it to Brother Andy
[2:20:33] I normally don't mess up my notes like
[2:20:35] this
[2:20:42] I'm I'm overlooking it
[2:20:47] testimony on the seat thank you
[2:20:50] to your brothers find that there
[2:20:53] yeah
[2:20:55] oh my goodness oh yes Lord thank you
[2:21:00] thank you brother Andy a testimony on
[2:21:03] the scene 1962. that's the reason I've
[2:21:05] been trying to keep the message just as
[2:21:08] simple as possible
[2:21:11] wow you're keeping the messages
[2:21:16] as possible
[2:21:19] because what I'm trying to do maybe some
[2:21:21] of you might be wondering why I'm not
[2:21:23] calling prayer lines each night
[2:21:26] here's my purpose
[2:21:28] I'm doing this I want to build faith in
