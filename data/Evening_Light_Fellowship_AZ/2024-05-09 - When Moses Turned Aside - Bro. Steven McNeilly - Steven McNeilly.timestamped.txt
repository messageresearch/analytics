[34:01] does it mean that he got to ring the

[34:06] means that whatever was there before God
[34:09] has taken away and he has healed him
[34:11] he's restored him his sight and for that
[34:13] we
[34:15] Rejoice praise the
[34:18] Lord yeah he's a special little boy
[34:21] Exodus 3: 3-6 now Moses kept the flock
[34:26] of Jethro his father-in-law the priest
[34:29] of Midian and he led the flock to the
[34:32] backside of the desert and came to the
[34:35] Mountain of God even to Horeb and the
[34:38] angel of the Lord appeared onto him in a
[34:40] flame of fire out of the midst of the
[34:42] Bush and he looked and behold the bush
[34:45] burned with fire and the Bush was not
[34:49] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[34:52] aside and see this great sight why the
[34:55] bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw
[34:58] that he turned aside to see God called
[35:02] onto him out of the midst of the Bush
[35:04] and said Moses Moses and he said here am
[35:09] I notice that Moses had to take a step
[35:13] in the right direction in order for God
[35:16] to speak to him from the bush in order
[35:20] for God to speak to him from the fire
[35:22] Moses had something to do amen so it is
[35:25] with you and I God has expecting us to
[35:28] take a step towards him in order for him
[35:31] to speak to
[35:33] us and and the Lord saw that he turned
[35:36] aside and he said here am I and he said
[35:38] draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes
[35:41] from thy feet for the place whereon thou
[35:44] standest is Holy Ground moreover he said
[35:47] I am the god of thy father the god of
[35:49] Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of
[35:52] Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was
[35:56] afraid to look look upon God what a
[36:00] reverence he had amen you all may be
[36:02] seated this evening may the Lord add the
[36:05] blessing to the reading of his
[36:07] word I would like to take for a subject
[36:11] this evening and call it when Moses
[36:14] turned
[36:16] aside it was a great time of Affliction
[36:20] at that time for the
[36:22] Hebrews uh when Moses was first
[36:25] born uh the Hebrews had been in slavery
[36:29] for many years to the Egyptians and and
[36:32] Pharaoh's desire was that uh that all of
[36:36] the the newborn the newborn male babies
[36:39] that was born to the Hebrew mothers that
[36:42] that they would be slain and that they
[36:44] would be killed and and we see here that
[36:48] um you know the reason that he was doing
[36:50] that was because he he was scared of the
[36:54] Hebrews uh whenever the Hebrew uh the
[36:57] people Patriarchs there first went into
[36:59] Egypt and everything we realized that
[37:01] they were small in number but as they
[37:03] began to grow and and to multiply and as
[37:07] there was a a new King in the land or a
[37:09] new Pharaoh whatever you want to call
[37:11] him who was raised up who knew not
[37:13] Joseph and he knew not the ways of God
[37:16] and and all of a sudden he he got scared
[37:18] and he said well if if there's a war and
[37:21] and these men of Israel turn against us
[37:24] we're doomed so I have this great plan
[37:28] that we're going to take care of a a
[37:30] whole generation of Hebrew men that are
[37:32] born and we're going to slay them and
[37:34] we're going to kill
[37:36] them because against popular belief of
[37:40] the world that we're living in today uh
[37:43] it takes a male in order to reproduce a
[37:47] human
[37:50] being typically it's the males that uh
[37:54] are the ones who stand up in times of
[37:56] War typically it's the males that are
[37:59] the ones who stand upon their
[38:01] convictions and it's the males are the
[38:04] ones that whenever's there's something
[38:06] to say they're not scared to say it I'm
[38:09] talking about a real man a real man that
[38:13] that stands up for what he believes in a
[38:15] man that's not scared to go to war for
[38:18] his family for his country and for his
[38:20] people a man that's not scared to stand
[38:23] toe to- Toe with the people that he
[38:25] cares about in order to see them through
[38:28] trials and tribulations and situations
[38:31] in their lives that's what real men do
[38:34] it wasn't the women that went out at
[38:36] times of War otherwise when David and
[38:39] his men went out at War you remember the
[38:42] story they were all out and they were
[38:44] fighting and they came back to camp and
[38:46] who was gone that was once there the
[38:48] women the children why were the women
[38:51] and children not out to war because a
[38:54] woman is not designed to go to war right
[38:58] the woman is made to be a keeper of the
[39:00] home and and all those different things
[39:03] but now we've we've got it so perverted
[39:06] in the day and hour in which we're
[39:08] living in where now the women are the
[39:11] ones who are stepping up the women are
[39:13] the ones who are wanting to go to war
[39:16] the women are the ones who whenever
[39:18] there's something to say they want to be
[39:20] the ones that say it why is this it used
[39:24] to be the man that used to do these
[39:26] things it's because Satan has perverted
[39:29] the ways of
[39:35] God so in order what Pharaoh was was
[39:39] trying to do he was really thinking of
[39:42] the future and he thought if I will just
[39:45] slay these uh these these male Hebrew
[39:49] boys I can do away with the man of the
[39:52] future I can do away with the fighters
[39:55] of the future I can do away with the
[39:58] with the heads of the home of the future
[40:00] they weren't going to slay the women it
[40:02] was the man that he was trying to slay
[40:04] it was the man that he was trying to do
[40:06] with because he knew if he could do away
[40:08] with the men he'll have control of the
[40:11] women so now we can take this down into
[40:14] the day and hour in which we're living
[40:16] in we are living in a time right now
[40:19] where the whole world society and
[40:22] governments around the world are trying
[40:24] to do away with manhood
[40:28] why are they trying to do away with
[40:30] manhood what is wrong with a man because
[40:33] a man will stand upon his convictions a
[40:35] man will fight for what he believes in
[40:37] he won't he won't shy away and just not
[40:39] say anything so they know if they can do
[40:42] away with the manhood they can control
[40:45] the
[40:48] society that's why now they've got a
[40:50] bunch of they they're they're
[40:52] brainwashing let me say it that way
[40:54] they're brainwashing our children
[40:57] from an early age to say if you don't
[41:00] feel like a boy you can be a girl why
[41:02] are they saying this because they're
[41:04] trying to do away with
[41:07] manhood so that there will come a time
[41:10] and if the Lord carries in a generation
[41:13] or two to
[41:14] come that manhood will be totally
[41:17] destroyed manhood will be completely
[41:19] done away with and those who are real
[41:22] men will be seen as narcissists or
[41:25] whatever name you want to give it
[41:29] oh this guy's in the he's he's he's old
[41:31] school this guy's a woman hater this
[41:33] guy's this no this guy's just a real
[41:36] man but why are they doing it they're
[41:39] trying to do it because they want
[41:41] complete control of society and if they
[41:45] can get the man to lower their standards
[41:48] right if they can get the man to lower
[41:50] themselves down to just be a complete
[41:53] pushover and sand do whatever anybody
[41:55] wants them to sand do they have control
[41:57] of everything God help us huh what an
[42:00] evil perverted time we are living
[42:08] in why are they doing
[42:11] this because there's an
[42:15] agenda
[42:17] transgenderism it's just something that
[42:19] they're using to
[42:21] push that's right but there's a bigger
[42:23] picture that's going on behind the
[42:25] scenes that that we know know
[42:27] something's going on we know something
[42:29] is being planned but we don't know
[42:31] exactly what it
[42:35] is God wants men to be real
[42:39] men not only does he want us to be real
[42:42] men but he wants us to be God-fearing
[42:45] men God-fearing men that'll hold a
[42:47] standard in our homes God-fearing men
[42:50] that'll tell the truth even when it
[42:52] hurts to her kids or to her wife
[42:54] God-fearing men that'll stand for what's
[42:56] right even when the government says it's
[43:03] wrong watch this Satan zeden in 1965
[43:08] brother brandham he says and now she has
[43:12] got her atom to wearing her underneath
[43:16] clothes a man put on them little old
[43:19] looking shorts and get out there
[43:21] and and I don't think there's much man
[43:23] to him he's the biggest I know of
[43:28] see she she's got she's got her
[43:31] perverted adom to act like she see now
[43:35] this is back in
[43:38] 1965 I wonder if brother brandham would
[43:41] was alive now what he would say about
[43:43] society and about manhood and about the
[43:46] things that's going on in this world
[43:51] today I tell you one thing he wouldn't
[43:53] say nothing about it
[43:57] he'd have something to
[44:01] say see she's got her perverted Adam
[44:04] Delight to act like she wearing her
[44:07] underneath clothes she seen what she
[44:09] could do out yonder when she took off
[44:11] all her clothes but her but her
[44:14] underneath ones that's the shorts of
[44:16] course that's the woman's underneath
[44:18] clothes and here her Adam is wearing
[44:20] them now which according to God's
[44:21] original word is abomination for a woman
[44:24] to put on a garment that pertains to a
[44:26] man and a man to put on a garment that
[44:28] pertains to a woman from the original
[44:30] word think of it now he wears her bangs
[44:34] also he Combs him down puts a curler in
[44:38] them some of the most sickly sights I've
[44:41] ever seen in my life is some of those
[44:44] kids out here today with their bangs
[44:46] comb down like this and colored bleached
[44:50] hair with some kind of a peroxide or
[44:53] something and bleach their hair and
[44:55] rolling it in curlers making bangs you
[44:58] big
[45:02] you know what's so funny about
[45:05] that I had the best blonde tips in
[45:07] Ireland at one
[45:13] point I had blonde tips I went one step
[45:16] further cuz everybody copied me in our
[45:18] little village and I got red tips in
[45:20] with my blonde tips and I just thought I
[45:23] was the coolest kid on the Block but
[45:25] here's Brother bradam s I was nothing
[45:28] but a big old wearing shorts
[45:31] bleach tips in my
[45:36] hair God have
[45:41] mercy had my hair parted like David
[45:47] Beckham not as long as brother Ron's
[45:49] hair but it was pretty
[45:52] good I thought if I have my hair just
[45:55] like his and I wear the number seven
[45:57] shirt and I wear the the Predator adidad
[46:01] shoes Adidas I'll play just like
[46:05] beam didn't
[46:10] happen that was nothing but a
[46:14] can you believe that
[46:17] amen and as we look out in the world
[46:20] today that's all we see pretty
[46:24] boys all we see is these these band boys
[46:26] boys and they got these these these hair
[46:29] and it's flicked up and and and they
[46:31] look so pretty like a pretty little
[46:34] girl ain't supposed to be pretty
[46:37] supposed to be
[46:40] men notice this I think this is just
[46:44] it's amazing hell that history repeats
[46:46] itself isn't
[46:49] it he said peroxide or something rolling
[46:52] it in curlers making bangs you big
[46:55] that's a horrible thing to sa from the
[46:57] pulpit but judgment begins at the house
[46:59] of God you don't even know whether
[47:02] you're a man or a woman and I understand
[47:05] that our United States Army is coming
[47:07] out next in shorts that's right see what
[47:10] the perversion is it's a woman's clothes
[47:13] where her bangs the other day I was over
[47:16] Howard Johnson's he says not this one
[47:18] but the one down the road I I sat back
[47:20] in amazement here come a little boy
[47:22] along his mouth open and he had dark
[47:25] hair here and had combed over this away
[47:28] and put a roller in it and curled it up
[47:30] around top of his top of his eyes
[47:33] looking out the top of his eyes going
[47:35] around if I ever seen a perversion see
[47:38] he wouldn't believe it he could prove
[47:41] maybe he was male but in his Spirit he
[47:44] is female he don't know what side of the
[47:47] house he belongs to that's right how
[47:49] perverted That's what Satan does so who
[47:52] does this it's Satan he says they could
[47:56] prove that they were men all day if they
[47:58] want to but in their Spirit they have a
[48:01] feminine Spirit why because they're
[48:04] doing their hair like she's doing her
[48:06] hair he's wearing her underneath
[48:08] garments and because of this perversion
[48:11] there's something in the inside that's
[48:13] not right so God help us because the
[48:17] things that we see the things that we
[48:19] wear how we do her hair and all these
[48:22] different things it has an effect on our
[48:24] natural man
[48:27] though we would say not me I'm not
[48:30] perverted but yet in our
[48:33] spirit in our
[48:35] spirit something's
[48:38] happening he said brother Stephen what
[48:40] why are you saying these things because
[48:43] I see it in the world and when you see
[48:45] it in the world it's not too long before
[48:47] it creeps into the church and it's a
[48:50] spirit and so if we can go after the
[48:53] spirit before it takes off in full
[48:56] flight God can take care of
[48:59] it so you say brother Stephen does it
[49:02] make a difference absolutely it makes a
[49:06] massive difference it'll make a
[49:08] difference how we how we dress and
[49:10] conduct ourselves guys let me tell you
[49:12] something it'll affect your spiritual
[49:14] walk with
[49:17] Christ if we're doing wrong and we're
[49:19] acting wrong and we're dressing wrong
[49:21] and and we're doing all these different
[49:23] things guess what it's going to affect
[49:25] our walk with Christ and so if we want
[49:28] to freshen up if we want to get closer
[49:31] with God guess what there's a good place
[49:33] to start and that's right here take a
[49:35] look at ourselves in the mirror and say
[49:38] how do I look how's my hair am I am I am
[49:42] I looking like the world or am I looking
[49:44] like a Christian am I looking like a
[49:47] as brother Brandon would put it or
[49:49] am I looking like a a young man that
[49:51] loves Jesus Christ because they look
[49:54] completely different
[49:58] when we get ourselves right
[50:02] hallelujah our walk with cl will be
[50:05] closer amen absolutely no different than
[50:08] with our
[50:12] sisters if we're on
[50:14] borderline all the time guess what we're
[50:16] going to be a borderline believer in all
[50:18] our walk with God if we're borderline in
[50:20] our dress if we're borderline and how we
[50:22] look guess what our walk with God is
[50:24] going to be borderline but if our life
[50:27] and how we dress and how we act as
[50:29] Holiness and modesty guess what's going
[50:31] to happen we're going to have a closer
[50:33] walk with God and that's what we all
[50:39] want he says That's what Satan does he
[50:43] perverts the Nations he perverts the
[50:46] church he perverts the people he is a
[50:51] deceiver a perverter of the original
[50:55] truth
[50:57] my so what does he want to do he wants
[50:59] to pervert
[51:02] us but let us be real man amen let us
[51:06] stand for truth let us stand behind what
[51:09] the prophet of God says and say though
[51:12] this hurts it hurts in my spirit it
[51:16] hurts in my heart it hurts but I say
[51:19] Amen
[51:21] Lord I've had to say it many a
[51:25] time and and I'll have to continue to
[51:27] say Lord that hurts but I accept
[51:33] it so it was at this time that Moses was
[51:36] born it was a time of slavery and
[51:40] bondage and the Bible said that the
[51:42] Egyptians made them to serve with
[51:46] rigor uh rigor means to break apart to
[51:49] fracture that is with severity or
[51:54] cruelty to say that the Hebrew people
[51:57] were living in a very harsh environment
[52:01] and a very hard time uh is an under
[52:04] statement and we can see that um how
[52:08] they were treated at that time and they
[52:10] were treated so severely and they were
[52:13] treated very harshly and they were
[52:15] treated very cruly and Lally because
[52:19] they uh Pharaoh was trying to get their
[52:22] their structure to their their beliefs
[52:24] to fracture within themselves
[52:28] that they would just become a slave to
[52:30] whatever they said if Satan can get you
[52:33] to fracture through a little bit of
[52:36] persecution through a little bit of
[52:38] hardships you know what it's going to do
[52:40] it's going to fracture your faith in
[52:44] God that you'll not want to walk anymore
[52:46] in these ways well this is just
[52:49] slavery understand God hasn't made us to
[52:51] be slaves to anything right but God has
[52:54] made us free amen but it's up to us to
[52:57] accept the freedom of our Liberty that
[52:59] he has given to
[53:01] us and so Satan he wants to pervert us
[53:05] he wants to pervert the people he wants
[53:07] to pervert the church he wants to
[53:09] pervert the word why because he is the
[53:12] original
[53:14] perverter and so if he can get us off
[53:17] and he can get us off in our spiritual
[53:19] walk guess what he's won the fight in
[53:20] our
[53:22] lives so we see that at the first coming
[53:25] of Moses they were in slavery they were
[53:28] in bondage they were having hard times
[53:31] and they were being persecuted and
[53:33] whipped and so on and so
[53:36] forth you know I I uh I saw this thing
[53:41] the other day and it was of a a little
[53:44] cup and um it had a had a bunch of gats
[53:47] in it flies whatever they were and it
[53:50] had a lid on it and you can see these
[53:52] little gats and these little flies were
[53:54] trying to jump they were trying to fly
[53:55] and get out of this thing
[53:56] and every time they would jump up they
[53:58] would hit the thing and they would drop
[53:59] and they would fly and and and you could
[54:01] just see these little these little guys
[54:03] are just going like this up and down up
[54:04] and down up and down until finally the
[54:07] person they took the lid and they took
[54:08] the lid off of it and you know those
[54:11] little gnats or those little Flies what
[54:13] they did they only went up as far as it
[54:17] was before with the lid on and they
[54:19] didn't realize that the lid was off and
[54:22] and they and they and they had the
[54:23] opportunity to be free in Christ they
[54:26] had the opportunity to get out of the
[54:29] bondage and to get out of the slavery
[54:31] and to get out of those things but
[54:32] because they were so accustomed to the
[54:35] environment that they were in they got
[54:37] used to only going so high I want to
[54:41] tell you that you can go a whole lot
[54:43] higher than what you're going right now
[54:45] I don't care how many times you've
[54:47] failed I don't care how many times that
[54:49] you've tried I don't care how many times
[54:52] you've only jumped so high but I'm
[54:54] telling you that the Bible said to come
[54:57] up
[54:58] hither I want you to come up higher cuz
[55:01] I want to show you things that are to
[55:03] come so don't get accustomed to your
[55:06] faults and failures of yesterday and
[55:09] today but God is telling you to come on
[55:12] up higher and if he summoned you to come
[55:15] on up higher he's made a way for you to
[55:17] do it
[55:20] amen you are designed to go higher than
[55:23] what you're going right now you are
[55:25] designed to fly and the soar in the
[55:28] skies Like an
[55:31] Eagle just spread your wings little
[55:35] Eagle it's time to get out of the nest
[55:38] it's time to get out of your comfort
[55:40] zone a little bit it's time to spread
[55:42] your wings it's time to take a jump a
[55:45] leap of faith and and and stop relying
[55:48] on other people to encourage you but
[55:51] encourage yourself in the Lord
[55:57] yes I think that's why things are
[55:59] getting a little turbulent right
[56:02] now and we're we're getting
[56:05] antsy there's a there's an antsiness
[56:08] about us there there there's something
[56:10] that we know is is is is is happening
[56:13] and and the more news that you read it's
[56:15] bad news and the more articles that you
[56:17] read not it's bad and it's all just
[56:20] dooming it's all just
[56:22] Gloom spend your time in the good news
[56:27] instead of listening to Satan of telling
[56:29] you who you're not read and see who you
[56:37] are so we see that it was it was it was
[56:41] Moses at this time that was born and how
[56:44] they were being treated at that time and
[56:46] it was almost like a time of tribulation
[56:49] for the Jewish people and we see that
[56:52] when Moses comes again with Elijah that
[56:56] it is a time of tribulation as it was
[57:00] back then and but this time when Moses
[57:03] and Elijah come they're going to come
[57:05] and they're going to preach the same
[57:07] gospel that you and I believe today and
[57:10] what is it going to do it's going to
[57:12] take their hearts and turn it to Jesus
[57:16] Christ the Feast of the trumpets brother
[57:18] brandham says Moses and Elijah has got
[57:21] to call the Pentecostal Jubilee is still
[57:25] going or had up till this time see now
[57:29] the Feast of trumpets has to be known
[57:31] and this one over here of Malachi 4 is
[57:34] not connected with that one over there
[57:37] no not at all notice watch here the
[57:40] ministry will be Moses and Elijah
[57:43] changing and calling Israel from the
[57:45] Jewish Traditions listen from Jewish
[57:49] Traditions that they had been mixed up
[57:51] in what kind of traditions traditions of
[57:55] the red he for instance now they're
[57:58] coming back to their old traditions
[58:00] where they're trying to go back to uh to
[58:03] the atonement and to the to the time of
[58:05] the slaying of the red heer and the
[58:07] sprinkling of the blood and all these
[58:09] different things but when Moses and
[58:11] Elijah come they're going to take them
[58:13] away from the Traditions that they're
[58:15] used to and they're going to point them
[58:17] to Jesus Christ because he is all their
[58:20] Traditions wrapped up in
[58:24] one he says being prophets they'll
[58:26] believe him calling them to the Feast of
[58:29] atonement Christ letting them recognize
[58:32] Christ they'll say he is coming he'll be
[58:35] here the Jews will be gathering things
[58:38] like that when did it all start it all
[58:40] started when they became a nation in
[58:43] 1946 and now God has slowly been working
[58:46] and slowly been with Israel through all
[58:49] the wars and through all the different
[58:50] things that they have been through and
[58:52] let me say this he may not have turned
[58:54] to them completely but God is with
[59:00] Israel what will Moses and Elijah do at
[59:03] this time of tribulation he'll take them
[59:05] and they'll Point them to Jesus
[59:07] Christ what we are seeing with the
[59:10] attack on Israel and October 11th what
[59:13] is it it's pre-tribulation Spirits what
[59:17] are we seeing amongst us worldwide now
[59:21] in the western civilization with all the
[59:24] college campuses and all those different
[59:26] things we're seeing an absolute uprise
[59:29] in
[59:31] anti-Semitism what are they doing what
[59:34] are they protesting against they're
[59:36] protesting against the chosen of God
[59:39] they're protesting against the ones that
[59:42] God has said they are my
[59:46] people and here they are they're they're
[59:48] they're on their college campuses and
[59:50] they're saying away with Israel they're
[59:54] saying gas the Jews and all all these
[59:56] different horri horrible horrible things
[59:59] and nobody's doing a single thing about
[1:00:04] it people can just say what they want
[1:00:07] and get away with
[1:00:08] it they can just come against the people
[1:00:12] of God and nothing's ever said about it
[1:00:16] they can say gas the Jews kill every one
[1:00:18] of them get them out of here I let me
[1:00:20] ask you a question where is this hatred
[1:00:23] coming from
[1:00:27] it is a
[1:00:28] pre-tribulation spirit that is rising up
[1:00:32] within the people right now and what is
[1:00:34] it doing it is coming against the
[1:00:36] children of Israel though all they were
[1:00:39] doing is protecting
[1:00:43] themselves did any of you see what
[1:00:46] President Biden just did the other day
[1:00:49] he put a pause on 3,500 bombs to go to
[1:00:52] Israel y why would he do so such a thing
[1:00:56] I thought America was with
[1:00:59] Israel I thought we stand with Israel I
[1:01:02] thought we'll protect Israel at any
[1:01:05] cost
[1:01:07] slowly but
[1:01:09] surely right she's starting to back
[1:01:12] away so as us as Believers yeah we've
[1:01:17] we've seen we've already seen our sign
[1:01:19] our hearts have already been turned but
[1:01:21] what should this be doing to us we
[1:01:23] should be saying I know what this is
[1:01:26] and I know where this is leading to you
[1:01:29] better get serious with
[1:01:32] God they're slowly backing away we're
[1:01:35] going to put a pause on this because of
[1:01:40] humanitarianism wow but yet they don't
[1:01:44] do anything whenever there's a bunch of
[1:01:46] college
[1:01:48] students and they take an American flag
[1:01:50] down and they put a Hamas flag up
[1:01:57] where are we
[1:01:59] at where are we in
[1:02:01] society none of us really go to college
[1:02:04] does any of you guys go to college they
[1:02:06] had it here at
[1:02:08] ASU they had all these protests we
[1:02:11] should all go down and see what it's
[1:02:14] like I want to stay as far away from
[1:02:17] that as I possibly
[1:02:20] can but understand this brother Braden
[1:02:24] preaches a series and he says Israel and
[1:02:28] the
[1:02:29] church so whatever happens to Israel
[1:02:32] it's a type of what's going to happen
[1:02:34] with the
[1:02:36] church so if they're rising up against
[1:02:39] Israel and they're rising up with
[1:02:41] anti-Semitism and they're rising up and
[1:02:43] all these different things what are they
[1:02:44] going to do with the rights of us as
[1:02:46] Believers brother brandham says they'll
[1:02:48] shut our
[1:02:50] doors it's becoming more of a reality
[1:02:54] every day that we live than it was was
[1:02:56] 10 15 years ago say there's no way
[1:02:59] they'll shut our
[1:03:00] doors Prov Co proved different
[1:03:05] right they shut
[1:03:07] him they tried to have church brother
[1:03:10] Steve Brant in Quebec it was a Skeleton
[1:03:14] Crew The Neighbors complained police
[1:03:17] came in told them all to get
[1:03:19] out he say well we won't have a church
[1:03:22] we'll just have it at our
[1:03:24] house my my my my my we'll go into a
[1:03:28] field we'll go somewhere where they'll
[1:03:31] never get
[1:03:32] us you're
[1:03:36] right ain't
[1:03:39] happening Brother
[1:03:41] Stephen what are you trying to say I'm
[1:03:44] trying to show us where we're at modern
[1:03:47] events that are being made clear by
[1:03:50] prophecy we're seeing where we're at in
[1:03:52] the time piece of God and it shouldn't
[1:03:54] put us into fear because guess what it
[1:03:57] is a it is a great it is a dreadful day
[1:04:00] it is a fearful day for those who are
[1:04:02] not in Christ Jesus for those who
[1:04:04] haven't been sealed of God who aren't
[1:04:06] ready for a second coming who aren't
[1:04:08] ready for a body change guess what it's
[1:04:10] an absolute Dreadful and fearful day but
[1:04:13] for the believer for those who have been
[1:04:16] born by a spirit for those who have been
[1:04:19] sealed by his holy ghost for those who
[1:04:21] are watching and waiting ready for a
[1:04:23] Rapture it's a great day
[1:04:26] so let me ask you this evening what kind
[1:04:28] of day is it for you is it a great day
[1:04:31] or is it a dreadful day only you know in
[1:04:34] your heart of hearts and let me say this
[1:04:37] if in your heart of hearts you're saying
[1:04:38] I don't know it sure feels like a
[1:04:40] dreadful day you got time because
[1:04:43] there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat
[1:04:45] there's still blood there's still Grace
[1:04:47] there's still Mercy he's still there
[1:04:49] there's still time
[1:04:55] I'm thankful for
[1:04:57] that you know why because I got family
[1:05:00] members who aren't saved I got children
[1:05:04] that need to have an experience with God
[1:05:07] the same kind of experience that I had
[1:05:09] that changed their
[1:05:12] lives
[1:05:18] amen that's a scary thing isn't it you
[1:05:22] know uh will our kids go in the Rapture
[1:05:25] well
[1:05:26] brother Bram said if they're predestined
[1:05:28] to
[1:05:29] it and then you begin to
[1:05:32] think man Mama dad's gone and then
[1:05:35] where's our little ones what happens you
[1:05:38] don't even want to think about
[1:05:40] it and I just say this by faith that the
[1:05:44] grace of God is greater than my fear of
[1:05:47] my kids he said I'll give you and your
[1:05:51] family and to your children and to your
[1:05:54] children's children
[1:05:56] that's the kind of gospel that I want to
[1:05:58] believe a positive gospel not a gospel
[1:06:01] that leaves me in fear of the not
[1:06:10] unknowing and jobed saw the conditions
[1:06:13] around her she didn't go to
[1:06:16] fearing but rather it put her into
[1:06:19] action she she made a basket out of bull
[1:06:22] rush bull rush and she sealed it with
[1:06:24] pitch on the outside side this is
[1:06:26] Moses's mother when Moses was born
[1:06:29] though she was living in a time of
[1:06:31] turmoil though she was living in a time
[1:06:34] of slavery and bondage and and all these
[1:06:36] different things and that if her little
[1:06:38] boy was ever found he'd be
[1:06:40] slayed she didn't fear right but she got
[1:06:44] into action right because she knew that
[1:06:47] he was a a goodly boy she knew that
[1:06:50] there was something special about him so
[1:06:52] she prepared him a little basket the the
[1:06:55] Bible says she prepared an
[1:06:58] ark and she took that Ark and she placed
[1:07:01] a little boy within it and she put it
[1:07:03] down the River Nile a river that was
[1:07:06] full of crocodiles a river that was full
[1:07:08] of things that could have eat them up
[1:07:10] real good a river to where if there was
[1:07:12] soldiers around and they would see
[1:07:14] something floating down the river
[1:07:16] perhaps they would get it and they would
[1:07:17] do what they want with this little Moses
[1:07:20] in this little Ark but she didn't think
[1:07:22] about those things she got into action
[1:07:25] because she believed
[1:07:27] God and so she put him down this River
[1:07:30] Nile though it was dangerous and
[1:07:32] everything else but her faith in God
[1:07:35] Almighty was greater than her fear of
[1:07:38] her surroundings and she knew if she
[1:07:41] would just get him out there that God
[1:07:43] would take him to the right place
[1:07:46] because God had a purpose for his life
[1:07:49] so it is with you and I God has a
[1:07:52] purpose for us in our lives when we look
[1:07:54] at the world around us we don't need to
[1:07:56] fear about those things because God is
[1:07:59] in
[1:08:01] control
[1:08:02] yes
[1:08:04] right she had a revelation from God that
[1:08:08] God was going to use this little boy he
[1:08:11] was a goodly
[1:08:12] boy she knew that God had all things in
[1:08:18] control he's got it
[1:08:21] all in control amen he's got it all in
[1:08:30] control he put this reassurance many of
[1:08:34] you are reassured tonight that God has
[1:08:37] all things in control amen all things
[1:08:41] yes what is she she was the type of the
[1:08:46] church telling us to put our needs in
[1:08:49] the
[1:08:50] Arc of God's
[1:08:52] word because it's only in the ark of of
[1:08:55] God's word that we have safety it's only
[1:08:59] in the ark of God's word where our needs
[1:09:02] can be
[1:09:04] met so if you have a wayward loved one a
[1:09:08] mom a dad a son a daughter a cousin
[1:09:12] whatever it may be put them wrap them up
[1:09:16] in the Arc of God's word and just give
[1:09:20] it to God and let God have his way and
[1:09:24] let God take control because fearing
[1:09:27] over it and worrying over it doesn't do
[1:09:29] anything but bring anxiety in our bodies
[1:09:32] and bring sickness into our
[1:09:35] lives I want you to call out somebody's
[1:09:38] name within your heart right now
[1:09:40] somebody that you know is not doing what
[1:09:43] they should be doing somebody that you
[1:09:45] know is in a backsliding state I don't
[1:09:47] care who it is I don't care of the
[1:09:50] situation I want you to call out their
[1:09:52] name in your heart and place them within
[1:09:54] the word of God and say God they are
[1:09:58] yours and they are yours for your
[1:10:01] Kingdom's Glory I don't care what's in
[1:10:03] the River Nile I don't care of
[1:10:05] circumstances and things that's around
[1:10:07] us father I'm placing them in your word
[1:10:11] Lord have your
[1:10:15] way give it to God and watch God take
[1:10:19] control give it to God and watch God
[1:10:22] work on their lives give it to God and
[1:10:24] watch God work work on our
[1:10:27] situations amen put it in the ark of
[1:10:31] God's word and God will take care of the
[1:10:38] rest it was good
[1:10:40] enough for the Hebrew children in the
[1:10:43] fiery
[1:10:44] furnace if God was good enough for them
[1:10:47] God is good enough for
[1:10:49] me if God was good enough for Daniel in
[1:10:53] the Lion's Den he still good enough
[1:10:57] today if God was good enough for Noah to
[1:11:00] prepare an ark for the saving of his
[1:11:02] family God is still good enough today if
[1:11:07] God was good enough to give a man back
[1:11:09] his sight God is still good enough today
[1:11:13] if God was good enough to make a lame
[1:11:15] man walk God is still good enough today
[1:11:19] that's good enough for me if God was
[1:11:22] good enough to heal a woman with a blood
[1:11:24] issue let me tell you something God is
[1:11:26] still good enough
[1:11:28] today if God was good enough to give
[1:11:31] salvation to a PO woman Sons God is
[1:11:35] still good enough
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:38] today and that's good enough for
[1:11:42] me if you got a mountain in your life
[1:11:44] let me tell you God is good enough yes
[1:11:46] he is and that's good enough for me amen
[1:11:49] if you got a river that seems
[1:11:50] uncrossable God can part those
[1:11:54] Waters why because he's a never ever
[1:11:57] changing God and he's still the same
[1:12:00] today as he was back
[1:12:03] then and that's good enough for me is
[1:12:07] that good enough for
[1:12:10] you H
[1:12:14] Allelujah Moses was raised in the house
[1:12:16] of Pharaoh's daughter till he came to a
[1:12:19] place where he had to make a decision of
[1:12:21] who he truly was himself Hebrews 11:24
[1:12:24] through
[1:12:25] 27 by faith Moses when he was come to
[1:12:28] years he refused to be called the son of
[1:12:30] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:12:32] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[1:12:34] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:12:36] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:12:40] greater
[1:12:41] riches the reproach of Christ greater
[1:12:47] riches
[1:12:49] amen than the treasures in Egypt for he
[1:12:53] had respect onto the recompense of the
[1:12:56] reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[1:12:59] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:13:01] endured as seeing him who is
[1:13:06] invisible the trials of this life you
[1:13:09] know what it is it's greater
[1:13:11] riches going the Lord's going the
[1:13:14] straight and narrow way with the Lord's
[1:13:16] despise few let me tell you what it is
[1:13:18] it is greater riches it is greater
[1:13:20] riches than this than this world worldly
[1:13:23] Egypt Treasures that we could ever get
[1:13:26] the trials in our lives is worth more to
[1:13:29] us than all the money that this world
[1:13:31] could
[1:13:32] offer you know why because our money is
[1:13:35] going to
[1:13:36] perish it's going to burn it's going to
[1:13:39] burn up it's nothing but wood hay and
[1:13:42] stubble but the riches that we gain
[1:13:45] through through through the molding of
[1:13:47] character yes through the trials and
[1:13:50] tribulations of this life this little
[1:13:52] speck of dust of life like a little like
[1:13:55] a blade of grass that Springs up and
[1:13:58] dies away
[1:14:01] again greater
[1:14:05] riches your
[1:14:07] trials that's providing character it's
[1:14:10] proving you and is bringing forth
[1:14:12] character in your life is greater than
[1:14:16] anything that this world could offer
[1:14:19] wow
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:22] wow what an Outlook
[1:14:26] what a way to look at things yeah that's
[1:14:29] the Bible's way of looking at things
[1:14:34] amen Moses made a decision to follow the
[1:14:37] lord his mom the church she did a really
[1:14:41] good job of telling him who he was where
[1:14:44] he came from and what his true identity
[1:14:46] was as a Hebrew until finally something
[1:14:49] happened in his heart when he seen a
[1:14:52] fellow Hebrew being smitten and being
[1:14:55] evily treated like brother uh Warren
[1:14:59] said the other week there's got to be a
[1:15:01] time of decision yes a time of decision
[1:15:06] when we choose God and God changes Our
[1:15:09] Lives that's right I feel sometimes
[1:15:13] that there's there's a big difference in
[1:15:17] a
[1:15:17] confession and a conversion
[1:15:20] right A lot of times if you if you put
[1:15:23] enough pressure on a person to make a
[1:15:26] confession and to make a good confession
[1:15:29] and it's a it's a nice confession it's a
[1:15:32] decision that they make and and it's a
[1:15:34] confession of I I want to live for God
[1:15:36] and I want to do what's right but unless
[1:15:39] that confession is molded into a
[1:15:42] conversion it's nothing but a
[1:15:45] confession brother bradam says I fear
[1:15:48] that we're not getting the people to
[1:15:51] Christ that's my desire not just for
[1:15:55] outward confession from our lips but a
[1:15:57] conversion of the heart of the Stony
[1:16:01] heart being taken away and God giving us
[1:16:03] a heart of new flesh not just a
[1:16:07] confession to make people happy not just
[1:16:10] a confession because you know that
[1:16:13] that's what some people want to hear but
[1:16:15] a conversion of the heart and soul or it
[1:16:19] doesn't matter where you are who you're
[1:16:22] with you're still a Christian it doesn't
[1:16:25] matter if other Christians are around
[1:16:27] you're still a Christian you still do
[1:16:29] what's right you still stand upon
[1:16:31] Integrity you don't tell lies you do the
[1:16:34] right thing why because it's not just a
[1:16:36] confession it's a
[1:16:39] conversion amen but when it's just a
[1:16:43] confession the life doesn't back it
[1:16:46] up when it's just a confession when that
[1:16:50] person's not around
[1:16:52] Believers they're no longer believers
[1:16:55] they believe what the other people say
[1:16:58] they believe what how the other people
[1:17:00] act they believe how everybody else
[1:17:02] dresses and so they act
[1:17:05] accordingly why because it's a
[1:17:08] confession
[1:17:09] God let us go past the confessions of
[1:17:12] our mouth down into the soul deep down
[1:17:16] within our hearts to a
[1:17:19] conversion when somebody is converted
[1:17:22] brother brandom says you don't got to
[1:17:23] Baby him
[1:17:26] amen he said you don't you they're not a
[1:17:29] a a hot bed plant or whatever it is he
[1:17:33] said you don't got to Baby him you don't
[1:17:34] you don't got to come here and spray
[1:17:36] pesticides on them and all that stuff no
[1:17:39] they don't need those things why because
[1:17:41] they've been converted they've been
[1:17:43] filled with the Holy Ghost so they don't
[1:17:45] need petted and babied and and
[1:17:47] encouraged all the time and and and told
[1:17:49] that they'll have a a position within
[1:17:51] the church no because they know who they
[1:17:53] are and there solid in who they are and
[1:17:56] they're sure in who they are because
[1:17:59] they've been
[1:18:02] converted yes
[1:18:07] Hallelujah so Moses made a decision
[1:18:10] that's important for us to make
[1:18:12] decisions every day in our lives we need
[1:18:16] to make the right decisions
[1:18:18] sir not just when we accepted Christ
[1:18:21] into our hearts but on a daily basis we
[1:18:25] need to wake up when then saying father
[1:18:28] help me to make the right decisions
[1:18:30] today in doing so you've already made
[1:18:33] the right decision because you started
[1:18:34] your morning with
[1:18:36] prayer Lord help me to do the right
[1:18:38] thing help me to make the right choices
[1:18:41] help me to do the right
[1:18:43] thing choices choices
[1:18:48] choices amen Exodus 2: 11 and 12 and it
[1:18:53] came to pass in those days of Moses was
[1:18:55] grown that he went onto his Brethren and
[1:18:57] looked on their burdens and he spied an
[1:18:59] Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his
[1:19:01] Brethren and he looked this way and that
[1:19:03] way notice because he knew what what he
[1:19:05] was going to do was wrong he had already
[1:19:09] made a choice in his life notice this
[1:19:11] he'd already made a choice his heart was
[1:19:13] already turning back towards his fellow
[1:19:16] people but watch what a confession or a
[1:19:20] decision does without a
[1:19:23] conversion and looked on their burdens
[1:19:25] and spied and he looked this way and
[1:19:27] that way and when he saw that there was
[1:19:28] no man he slew the Egyptian and hit him
[1:19:30] in the
[1:19:33] sand because of a decision without a
[1:19:37] conversion right it did nothing but
[1:19:39] cause a dead stinking Egyptian in the
[1:19:43] sand the righteous indignation with
[1:19:46] Moses it rose up within him and what did
[1:19:49] he end up doing he ended up taking
[1:19:50] matters into his own hands thinking that
[1:19:54] because of all his training and all of
[1:19:56] his abilities and all of what he's been
[1:19:59] been trained to do by pharaoh and and he
[1:20:01] could teach this one and teach that one
[1:20:03] and brother Brenham says he was a a
[1:20:05] mighty military man perhaps he knew how
[1:20:08] to take over the
[1:20:10] country perhaps he had it already
[1:20:13] planned out in his mind I'm just I'm
[1:20:14] just imagining right now so you can
[1:20:17] imagine with
[1:20:18] me he had it all planned out in his mind
[1:20:21] this is how it's going to happen and I
[1:20:23] know that the soft spots within Egypt
[1:20:26] and and I know how we can crumble this
[1:20:28] place and and I know how I can do this
[1:20:30] because I have the military uh
[1:20:32] excellence and I have the no all and I
[1:20:34] have the ability and all these different
[1:20:36] things and he took things into his own
[1:20:40] hands he knew what he was being raised
[1:20:42] up for but yet when he took it into his
[1:20:46] own hands because of his own abilities
[1:20:49] it was all
[1:20:53] wrong he made the right choice to
[1:20:56] forsake Egypt but because he was
[1:20:58] depending on
[1:21:00] himself it was wrong in the eyes of God
[1:21:04] and they turned him
[1:21:06] down understand God doesn't need our
[1:21:12] abilities he doesn't need our
[1:21:14] money he doesn't need what what we think
[1:21:17] we can offer all God needs is a
[1:21:20] surrendered heart a surrendered life a
[1:21:23] surrendered mind and a heart of a
[1:21:25] servant that he may serve God's people
[1:21:28] and watch God use that
[1:21:35] person Mo uh Exodus 3: 3-5 it's our
[1:21:39] opening scripture and and Moses said I I
[1:21:43] will now turn aside and and see this
[1:21:45] great sight why the bush is not burnt
[1:21:49] and when the Lord saw that he turned
[1:21:50] aside to seea God called onto him out of
[1:21:53] the midst of the Bush and said MO this
[1:21:54] Moses and he said here am I and he said
[1:21:57] draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes
[1:22:01] from the for uh from off thy feet for
[1:22:04] the ground in which thou
[1:22:06] standest it's Holy
[1:22:08] Ground no
[1:22:11] notice Moses turned to the
[1:22:14] side Moses was going one
[1:22:17] way he was a Shepherd of the flock he
[1:22:20] was taking care of his father-in-law's
[1:22:23] sheep but there was an attraction over
[1:22:25] to the side here and the attraction that
[1:22:29] this this this bush that was on fire
[1:22:31] that was not being consumed it it it
[1:22:33] caught his attention and he wondered
[1:22:36] wow I better check this out I I better
[1:22:39] see and and try to understand why this
[1:22:42] is happening and when the when God got
[1:22:44] his attention now then God begins to
[1:22:47] speak to Moses but Moses turned
[1:22:53] aside you've made a decision what is God
[1:22:56] doing now Moses he made a decision and
[1:22:59] he brought him through 40 Years of of of
[1:23:02] of of the Wilderness brother bradam says
[1:23:05] of absolutely beating everything out of
[1:23:07] him of what he his own abilities and
[1:23:09] everything that he was and everything
[1:23:11] that he could accomplish by
[1:23:13] himself because if you notice when when
[1:23:16] you read the story of Moses Moses says
[1:23:19] uh I'm I'm a man I I I I can't talk how
[1:23:23] can I go down how can I do these things
[1:23:25] well I thought he was some great
[1:23:28] person God beat it all out of him am can
[1:23:32] you imagine being out just with the
[1:23:33] Sheep herd and the
[1:23:36] Sheep you'd end up probably not a very
[1:23:39] uh what's it called an outward
[1:23:42] person you're used to talking to the
[1:23:46] sheep and we all know that us as
[1:23:48] husbands we don't talk to our wives much
[1:23:51] either yep mhm you know a secret you
[1:23:55] know how to be a uh a real good husband
[1:23:58] guys you just say enough to continue the
[1:24:03] conversation that's
[1:24:07] wisdom until she catches on and she says
[1:24:10] something out of the blue and you're
[1:24:11] like yep no problem honey Stephen you
[1:24:14] weren't listening no I was not repeat it
[1:24:16] again
[1:24:18] please I got to come up with new tricks
[1:24:24] but we see here
[1:24:27] that now you all you're all like sister
[1:24:30] Ashlin needs
[1:24:32] prayer you know her that per girl her
[1:24:36] husband doesn't give her any attention
[1:24:38] and you know yep and you can all agree
[1:24:41] that your husbands are exactly the same
[1:24:47] way it's something we need to learn to
[1:24:50] do better at isn't it huh sure it is you
[1:24:54] know she gives me a hard time she says
[1:24:56] you talk to James more in the phone than
[1:24:58] you do with
[1:25:00] me I'm like no I don't I promise it's
[1:25:04] just when we're
[1:25:06] driving you know when I worked with Amos
[1:25:08] she was like I wouldn't answer her call
[1:25:10] and then i' call her back 30 minutes
[1:25:12] later you were on the phone with brother
[1:25:15] Amos again weren't you yep I'm sorry but
[1:25:19] we're talking about work
[1:25:27] anyways you know
[1:25:29] what I guess let me preach it myself
[1:25:32] here this is real
[1:25:35] good this can be God right here if
[1:25:37] anything else wasn't God this can be I
[1:25:41] think we as husbands me myself
[1:25:43] included we need to do so much better
[1:25:46] guys we are terrible at communicating
[1:25:50] with our
[1:25:51] wives we're terrible at it
[1:25:55] you know the other week I was preaching
[1:25:56] at brother Paul halit and the Lord the
[1:26:00] Lord really moved on me very very
[1:26:03] sweetly and I said when was the last
[1:26:06] time you told your wife you loved her
[1:26:09] when was the last time that you give her
[1:26:11] words of endearment and I hit a real
[1:26:14] Channel and it was really nice and um
[1:26:17] and I said brother Paul I'm sorry I know
[1:26:19] it's your pulpit and he said no I told
[1:26:21] you in the back say whatever you want
[1:26:23] and so that was good so we get into the
[1:26:26] car and I sit down and she looks at me
[1:26:30] and I know she didn't even say a word I
[1:26:33] said I love you
[1:26:39] baby I guess one thing that I'm learning
[1:26:41] is that women like to
[1:26:43] communicate they like to
[1:26:45] talk they just don't like to talk to
[1:26:48] their friends but they like to talk to
[1:26:51] us go figure

[1:27:14] date once in a
[1:27:16] while we need to give her words of
[1:27:18] endearment you know why because that's
[1:27:20] what she
[1:27:21] needs she needs to be told that she's
[1:27:25] loved she needs to see the twinkle in
[1:27:27] your eye when you tell her that she's
[1:27:30] the most beautiful woman in the world
[1:27:33] that she's your
[1:27:35] sweetheart she's waited all day for us

[1:27:53] next person we're always thinking about
[1:27:55] something else when she's sitting right
[1:27:57] there next to
[1:27:59] us and all she wants to some
[1:28:04] attention I'm going to put myself out

[1:28:23] waiting
[1:28:28] words of
[1:28:29] endearment of love and compassion it's
[1:28:34] what a woman needs and I'm learning
[1:28:36] that's what she needs and I'm learning
[1:28:38] the hard way but it doesn't matter
[1:28:41] because I'm still learning and that's
[1:28:43] all that
[1:28:47] matters just get off your phone man

[1:29:32] good Youth Camp and if we have all these
[1:29:34] different things but yet your wife is
[1:29:36] unhappy at

[1:29:50] colleagues happy make your teacher happy
[1:29:53] by doing your school work you make

[1:30:08] there you know the Bible says uh lay the
[1:30:11] axe to the root of the tree man let the
[1:30:14] chips fall where they will chips are
[1:30:16] falling all over the place right
[1:30:18] now I'm blinded by the
[1:30:21] chips and I'm deafened by the silence
[1:30:24] amens of the sisters sisters say
[1:30:28] Amen give that husband to yours a
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:36] nudge I receive it
[1:30:41] Lord hallelujah uh the voice of the sign
[1:30:45] 1964 brother brandham says God gives the
[1:30:48] signs to attract the attention of the
[1:30:49] people here The Burning Bush was Des
[1:30:51] signed to attract the Prophet The
[1:30:53] Burning Bush Moses was uh backside of
[1:30:56] the desert hurting his sheep an old
[1:30:58] sheep hurter 80 years old long beard
[1:31:00] going along down alongside of a a
[1:31:03] familiar old path one hot morning
[1:31:05] perhaps and then all at once there came
[1:31:07] a a bush on fire and that bush did not
[1:31:10] consumed well that was Al together
[1:31:12] unusual now Moses being a scientist
[1:31:15] which he was taught in all the wisdom of
[1:31:17] the Egyptians they were greater
[1:31:19] scientists than we have today so being a
[1:31:22] a scientist look and he said now I'll go
[1:31:24] to to I'll go see what kind of chemical
[1:31:28] is sprayed on those leaves that the tree
[1:31:30] doesn't burn
[1:31:32] see if he'd see if he'd approached it in
[1:31:35] a scientific way it would have never
[1:31:38] talked to him let me say this if you
[1:31:43] approach the sign of God in this day by
[1:31:47] intellectualism and having a carnal
[1:31:50] understanding of Creeds and things that
[1:31:52] you've been taught throughout the ears
[1:31:54] The Voice will never speak to you and
[1:31:57] you'll never hear the voice you've got
[1:32:00] to get past the sign in order to hear
[1:32:04] the voice but the approach to the sign
[1:32:07] is what is so
[1:32:09] important very
[1:32:11] good he said if he had approached it in
[1:32:13] a scientific way I would have never
[1:32:15] talked to him so it is today when we're
[1:32:17] trying to approach through school and
[1:32:19] education in a scientific way you'll
[1:32:22] miss God a million
[1:32:26] miles so if we approach it through
[1:32:29] school education a scientific way we're
[1:32:33] going to miss God a million miles
[1:32:38] approach it like Moses with his shoes
[1:32:42] offen humble humility
[1:32:45] wow you want to get somewhere with God
[1:32:49] and hear his voice we've got to approach
[1:32:52] him through humility we've got to
[1:32:54] approach him with our shoes off and
[1:32:59] humbly but if we approach it through
[1:33:02] pride and if we approach it through a
[1:33:04] carnal understanding and if you approach
[1:33:07] it through just repeating what a
[1:33:09] minister said one time you're never
[1:33:11] going to catch the voice for yourself
[1:33:14] and that's the most important thing my
[1:33:17] brother and my sister is not just to
[1:33:20] repeat what brother Steven or brother
[1:33:22] Ron or or any of these other ministers
[1:33:24] say no it's to catch the voice for
[1:33:28] yourself you see the sign you see the
[1:33:32] message but you also catch the voice
[1:33:35] behind it because it's the voice of God
[1:33:39] and that's the most important thing for
[1:33:41] this
[1:33:45] day as the musicians come footsteps are
[1:33:51] possession Moses shoes they were they
[1:33:54] were
[1:33:55] filthy I got to I was driving in my car
[1:33:59] and I asked the Lord and I said Lord why
[1:34:02] did you tell him to take off his
[1:34:05] shoes like why didn't you tell him to do
[1:34:08] something
[1:34:09] else and the Holy Spirit spoke to my
[1:34:12] heart just as I was
[1:34:13] driving I wasn't in a time of fasting I
[1:34:17] wasn't in a time of deep prayer I wasn't
[1:34:20] in a time of of of deep con con
[1:34:24] uh consecration in the word of God no I
[1:34:26] was driving my
[1:34:28] car and I asked the Lord this simple
[1:34:31] question why did you tell him to take
[1:34:34] off his
[1:34:35] shoes and the Lord spoke to my heart it
[1:34:38] was the Holy Spirit you know a lot of
[1:34:41] times we get so caught up with I have to
[1:34:45] do this and and I have to do that and
[1:34:48] and I and I need to fast and I pray and
[1:34:50] and do all these different things and
[1:34:52] and that's part of it it is but yet it's
[1:34:56] not our works that cause God to speak to
[1:34:59] us it's not because of our works or
[1:35:02] anything that we have done or our great
[1:35:05] ability to to spend hours in prayer at
[1:35:07] night with God that that makes us hear
[1:35:10] the word of God and understand it but
[1:35:12] it's our approach to him that when we
[1:35:15] approach him with
[1:35:18] Simplicity and humbleness of heart and
[1:35:21] we say Lord I honestly don't understand
[1:35:26] this I'm asking a
[1:35:29] question
[1:35:31] why I'm not being
[1:35:33] arrogant I'm just
[1:35:37] wondering and it was just so simple and
[1:35:39] the Holy Spirit speaks back to my heart
[1:35:42] says footsteps are
[1:35:45] possession Moses was on a path yes and
[1:35:49] it was the wrong
[1:35:51] path he had possessed many different
[1:35:55] places he had possessed many things and
[1:35:58] and and seen many things and been many
[1:36:00] places and probably did a lot of things
[1:36:03] that he should not have done his his
[1:36:05] feet were
[1:36:08] filthy and so he said I the Holy Spirit
[1:36:10] quickened to my heart said I was
[1:36:12] changing the direction of his life
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:18] Wow his feet were filthy
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:24] even though he had made a decision back
[1:36:26] in
[1:36:28] Egypt he had made a confession he made a
[1:36:31] decision I'm I'm going to forsake the
[1:36:33] treasures of Egypt I'm going to forsake
[1:36:35] these things I'm I'm going to be with my
[1:36:37] brethren I'm I I want to take my way
[1:36:39] with the Lord's desp his few it was a
[1:36:42] decision but he had never met God face
[1:36:44] to
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:47] face he had never met the pillar of fire
[1:36:51] his life had never completely been
[1:36:54] changed he had never been sealed of God
[1:36:57] it was a confession it wasn't a
[1:37:00] conversion his feet was was
[1:37:03] dirty his feet were
[1:37:06] filthy but now God put this sign to
[1:37:11] attract his
[1:37:12] attention and Moses turned
[1:37:14] aside and he went after it and because
[1:37:18] he followed the voice of God and he took
[1:37:21] off his shoes and now he's standing in
[1:37:24] the presence of God
[1:37:26] Almighty now God can speak to him out of
[1:37:29] this
[1:37:30] fire and because his heart was
[1:37:33] right he had gotten rid of his pride he
[1:37:36] had gotten rid of his arrogance he had
[1:37:38] gotten rid of his his own abilities of
[1:37:41] how he thought things should have went
[1:37:42] now he was in the perfect place for God
[1:37:45] to use
[1:37:48] him understand when you make a decision
[1:37:51] for God things might not change right
[1:37:54] away it's a decision it's a step in the
[1:37:57] right
[1:37:58] direction but is it a
[1:38:01] conversion only your life will tell if
[1:38:03] it's a complete conversion or
[1:38:05] not but when you make that
[1:38:09] decision there's no turning
[1:38:11] back I've made a decision I'm going this
[1:38:15] way and I'm taking off my
[1:38:18] shoes because they're
[1:38:21] filthy and I want to come in to the pr
[1:38:23] presence of God
[1:38:26] Almighty when was the last time that you
[1:38:30] turned aside to see
[1:38:34] Jesus when was the last time that you
[1:38:38] were walking are you you put they talk
[1:38:41] so much now about having a block
[1:38:44] schedule and blocking things out and and
[1:38:47] making time for a certain person or a
[1:38:49] certain meeting and being here and they
[1:38:51] and they say I can tell you a lot lot
[1:38:53] about a man when I see his
[1:38:55] calendar I can see how how organized he
[1:38:59] is I can see if if he's got things in
[1:39:01] line I can see if he if he's a planner
[1:39:04] and a thinker ahead if if when I look at
[1:39:06] his
[1:39:07] calendar but I wonder how many times do
[1:39:10] we turn aside ourselves and we block out
[1:39:13] a time for God in our
[1:39:17] calendar well you say brother stepen I I
[1:39:20] already did it I I've been baptized by
[1:39:23] the Holy Ghost I I made a decision I've
[1:39:26] been converted praise God I I've been in
[1:39:29] this message for so many years and and
[1:39:31] my kids have been raised and and
[1:39:33] Hallelujah yeah yeah that's good but
[1:39:36] when was the last time that you turned
[1:39:38] aside and you took time for God when was
[1:39:42] the last time that you turned aside and
[1:39:45] you say
[1:39:46] father this time is for
[1:39:49] you it's not a time for anybody else
[1:39:54] it's not a time for any more meetings
[1:39:56] it's not a time for any worldly Affairs
[1:39:58] but it's a time for
[1:40:02] you and Moses turned
[1:40:05] aside I want you to put your name
[1:40:08] there and
[1:40:10] Stephen turned
[1:40:13] aside Thursday
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:17] morning because the presence of God on
[1:40:20] Wednesday night caught his attention
[1:40:23] and he turned aside realizing that he
[1:40:27] needs to give more attention to his
[1:40:30] spouse he turned aside from doing
[1:40:33] whatever it is that he wants to do and
[1:40:35] he put a block on his schedule just for
[1:40:38] me and Steven turned
[1:40:41] aside and when he turned aside what did
[1:40:44] he
[1:40:45] see there was an attraction what is the
[1:40:48] attraction it's it's God but he's he's
[1:40:51] attracting me to something
[1:40:54] he's attracting us to a closer walk he's
[1:40:57] attracting us to his voice he's
[1:41:00] attracting us to his word put your name
[1:41:03] in there and so and so turned aside and
[1:41:08] so and so turned
[1:41:12] aside some of you haven't turned aside
[1:41:14] in a
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:18] while so caught up with loud you see it
[1:41:23] so caught up with school getting good
[1:41:26] grades
[1:41:28] work
[1:41:30] family and the cares of Life came and it
[1:41:33] choked out the word that the word became
[1:41:37] unfruitful in their lives wasn't
[1:41:40] anything evil it was the cares of
[1:41:44] laa some of you have waited too long to
[1:41:47] turn aside but God has speaking to your
[1:41:50] heart this
[1:41:52] evening and and he's calling your
[1:41:54] name and he's saying tonight you need to
[1:41:57] turn
[1:41:59] aside you need to turn
[1:42:01] aside because I want to talk with you
[1:42:05] you need to turn aside because I want to
[1:42:08] have fellowship with you you need to
[1:42:10] turn
[1:42:11] aside because I have something greater
[1:42:14] for you I have a higher level to bring
[1:42:17] you to I have a higher consecration that
[1:42:20] you must give in your life it's time to
[1:42:23] turn
[1:42:24] aside it's time for us my brother and my
[1:42:27] sister to turn aside from the things of
[1:42:31] loudest here to say Lord I've been going
[1:42:34] this way and and I need to do these
[1:42:37] things but I'm I'm turning aside and and
[1:42:39] I'm putting my faith in you Lord I'm
[1:42:42] looking to the Cross I'm I'm I'm looking
[1:42:44] to the finished work you know that he is
[1:42:47] not a just a God who died upon a cross
[1:42:50] 2,000 years ago
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:54] you know that he's
[1:42:55] alive you know that he showed himself to
[1:42:58] the disciples after he rose from the
[1:43:00] dead and when their eyes were opened
[1:43:03] they recognized him you know that he has
[1:43:06] shown himself over the past 2,000 years
[1:43:10] to a select
[1:43:11] people why does he do that because he's
[1:43:17] alive we don't serve a God that just
[1:43:21] died and rose again 20 th000 years ago
[1:43:24] but we serve a God who is right here
[1:43:27] right now we serve a god whose ear is
[1:43:31] not too heavy and his arm is not too
[1:43:32] short we serve a God who is on speed
[1:43:35] dial every time you get on your knees to
[1:43:37] talk to
[1:43:39] him a God who
[1:43:41] speaks a God who
[1:43:44] Woos a God who changes lives a God who
[1:43:47] changes situations when we let him into
[1:43:51] our lives to change them
[1:43:53] amen let's bow our heads
[1:43:55] together Heavenly
[1:43:57] Father Lord we we thank you
[1:44:01] Lord for your mercy it endures
[1:44:08] forever you are not a god
[1:44:12] that is a god of just the past
[1:44:16] Lord and you are not a god of the future
[1:44:19] only but you are a God who is very
[1:44:22] present
[1:44:24] he is here he is a very present help in
[1:44:28] a time of need and and Lord you give me
[1:44:32] this thought of of turning aside and
[1:44:35] Moses turned aside
[1:44:38] and and Lord you know the struggle that
[1:44:40] I
[1:44:43] had 5:00 today and I'm still not
[1:44:47] done and I didn't know which way to turn
[1:44:49] Lord I but I had a thought of Moses
[1:44:53] turning
[1:44:54] aside and Lord I know that when you give
[1:44:57] me a thought that that thought is for
[1:45:00] somebody
[1:45:02] Lord perhaps it's for me
[1:45:07] also that I turned
[1:45:10] aside
[1:45:12] father may we turn
[1:45:15] aside from our own
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:19] ways to serve you a living God because
[1:45:23] you're calling us Lord you're you're
[1:45:25] you're bringing us to the side that you
[1:45:27] might talk to
[1:45:29] us that you might love us that you might
[1:45:34] speak to us that you might show us
[1:45:36] things that you might show us that you
[1:45:39] care and and you're near and you're
[1:45:41] alive and and you're a good
[1:45:44] god father I pray this evening that all
[1:45:50] of us would
[1:45:54] purpose in our
[1:45:56] hearts Lord to turn aside and put a
[1:45:59] block on our
[1:46:01] schedule for
[1:46:06] Elohim because really Lord that's all
