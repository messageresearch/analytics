Before we we'll read our needs now, then we'll we'll sing uh you're the glory and the lifter of my head. We only had one, but we've got a couple more here. Brother Ron has a special and spoken prayer request. And then also, brother Kelly, Kelly McMillan needs an encouraging touch and healing virtue. So, let's remember both of those. And then our brother David Rutled is in a rehabil rehabilitation center and is being well taken care of, but because of his mild stroke, he has a speech therapist coming four times a week. He also broke both his collar bones and he's in a lot of pain. So, let's just keep our brother David in prayer as well. Amen. and our our sister Debia Cell has been moved to the Phoenix Mountain Post Acute Care. Um she would love to be some visitors come. She'll be there for about four to five weeks and there's a bulletin board with the address and phone number for how to get there. So let's just continue to remember her and the visitors. We have a a sign up over there. Amen. Before we go to the Lord with these needs, let's sing you're the glory and the lifter of my head. If you have a need, didn't get a chance to turn it in, just give it to the Lord right now. Amen. You're my glory and the lift of my head. You're my glory and the lifter of my hand. Oh, thou, oh Lord, are a shield for me, my glory and the lifter of my hand. Amen. and our brother Johnny Green if you could come open our service. In order of prayer as he's coming, we do have two praise reports. Our sister Julie Frank was released from the hospital today. So, she's home resting. And our sister Perfect Noah has turned in a note. God bless you saints. I want to take a moment to thank the church for your prayers. Some time ago, I brought a request on behalf of a dear friend who is going through a very difficult season. She experienced two miscarriages and later gave birth to a stillborn baby. Was very heavy time and very overwhelming. But God is faithful. He heard the prayers of the saints and on January 2nd, 2026, he blessed her with a healthy baby girl. Thank you, church, for standing with her in prayer. So, we just thank the Lord for those two prayer requests. Brother John, if you could pray over our needs. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Rafa. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together. &gt;&gt; Gracious Lord Jesus, what an honor it is to come in your presence, Lord. We ask you, Lord, if there be any impediment in our life, anything you've seen that's none like you, Lord, please remove it out of the way. We just want to just come into your house with praise and thanksgiving in our heart. We want you, Father God, to come and bless us with your presence. Bless our brother Steve as he brings the word. And Lord, these prayer requests and needs. Lord, you know, every single one of them. There's so many more that we didn't even write down, but they're in our hearts. Lord, would you be with each one we pray, Father? May our faith increase, Lord, as we go from day to day. Lord, there's nothing in this world that's worth living for. You've given us, Lord Jesus, by your amazing grace, something to live for. Father, you said, "Where I am, you shall be also." And we're longing for that day to be with you. So Lord, thank you once again for meeting these needs and coming in amongst us. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you greet your neighbor as you're taking your seat this evening? Amen. The brothers in the back wanted me to announce just so you all remember our anniversary meetings. That'll be April 3rd, fourth, and fifth. We've got our brother Brian Naidu and our brother Ed Hammeister. So, just keep those dates on your calendar. Amen. Let's go ahead and key if that same spirit Amen. I need more of that spirit. I don't know about you this evening. Amen. If that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, dwell in you. If that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you, dwells in you. It will quicken your body. If that spirit dwell in you, it will quicken your Lord body. If that spirit dwells in you, if that saint, if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, dwell in me. If that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in me with me, this is what it'll do. It will quicken my body cuz that's well indeed. It will quicken my mortal body. If that spirit dwells in me, be well burn. Holy Spirit burning me. Set my soul on fire. Oh, fill me with the Holy Ghost and God's holy desire. Oh, make me like the Christ the healing and raising the dead. Well, give me the power that Jesus through the burn. Oh, burn. Holy Spirit burning me with my soul. Fill me with the Holy Ghost.

Give a hand clap of praise this evening. I would not be denied. Amen. I would not be denied. Oh, I would not be till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be. Let's sing that again. I would not. Oh, I would not be I would not be till Jesus came and made me old. I would not be verse one. things of destru I be Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be as Jacob in the name of Lord. I wrestle with the Lord. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. I would not be in verse three. I like this verse. He said my Lord was gone and would not hear my prayer for the praise in Christ. Amen. Heat. Heat.

As you look out across the land, see God's mighty hand to the bride of Christ adorning her wedding gown. Just like in the days of old, they stood courageful. They turned this whole world upside down. Oh, rise up. Oh, risen up. Oh, there's a new message to rise up. Oh, rise up. Oh, rise up. Oh, church. Well, the Bible went to tell how the Holy Ghost fell inside were done by the apostles.

Well, if you think it's all long gone and the miracles are done, I have some good news to bring to you. That's good news. In the last days, he'll pour out a spirit more and more like a mighty eagle. Your strength will renew. I'm rising up. I'm rising up. I'm rising up. Oh, I'm rising up. I'm rising up. Rising up. Oh, I'm rising. I'm rising up. I'm rising up. Oh, I'm that rising up.

Praise God. &gt;&gt; As we change the order of the service before our brother Steve comes to minister, let's sing I Believe. Amen. We learned this song a couple weeks ago. It's just so powerful. Amen. Just it's my testimony. Amen. Let's just worship him before our brother Steve comes. Amen. From the beginning, you've been unchanging. Oh, age to age you stay. Oh, constant you every mystery.

I believe that on that cross your love was true and by your stripes I have made you and every promise you fulfill And that same power lives in me. I'm born again. I've been made free. I believe. I believe that the gates of hell will not re. Your church is still alive and well. is goel truth I live. I believe I believe that one day that one day soon you'll fle the sky. You're coming for a spot is bright until my faith has been made sight. I believe. I believe. I believe. You are. We say you are. You do what you say. You are all you are straight to you. You are all faithful. Heavenly Father, we have our hands &gt;&gt; raised into the air speaking and singing those words. We believe, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; The gates of hell cannot prevail. &gt;&gt; Lord, because your word is ever true. It's yay and it's amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we see written in the scripture that you are alpha and omega. You are the beginning and the end. You are the provider of all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray that we would be like that little woman that would press in and touch &gt;&gt; the hem of your garment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever we have need of tonight, Lord, you can meet every single one of our needs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your word has expressed it to us, Lord. And we say, I believe. I believe, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, there are some that are sick amongst us. The doctor's reports are negative, but Father, we look to your word and we see that your report is true. You are the healer, Lord. By your stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that our faith would arise even now in the building &gt;&gt; to receive exactly what we have need of. Lord, there's prayer, there's faith uh praise reports before us. And many have said, God has touched us. And Lord, if you can do it for one, you can do it for another. &gt;&gt; So we believe it with all of our heart. And may our hearts not be troubled, neither shall we be afraid. &gt;&gt; But Lord, may we enter into your gates with gladness knowing that you have already provided. I pray Lord that you would now take the word of God and share it to the people. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm looking for you to come. Lord, I'm not looking for a man to do any any work here this evening. I pray, oh God, that you would use my lips, my my vessel, Lord, for the honor and glory of your word. And may the people receive every thing that they have need of whatever they've come for. May they receive it now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray. &gt;&gt; Father, may you clear my mind and loose my tongue that I might speak. Lord, &gt;&gt; may I not bring a hindrance, Lord, but may I bring an encouragement. We pray &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord with you this Wednesday evening to just worship the Lord. And I I want to thank you all for coming this evening. Amen. And I I thank brother Ron for opening his podium here today, his pulpit to me, and allowing me to share the word of God to you. And Amen. We sure love Brother Ron. I want to bring greetings from my home church with brother John Andes and all that know Brother John Andes. wanted me to share his love to you and and say that he just appreciates you all and he appreciates brother Ron and and so extension of love from end time message tabernacle and brother John Andy's. Amen. Praise I just have to soak you all in for just a minute. You're such wonderful people. Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles, would you? To Romans chap 12. Romans chapter 12 and we're going to read verse 1 and two. Romans chapter 12 and then we'll let you be seated and then we'll go to 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 18. But first we'll read Romans chapter 12. I appreciate this scripture. You know uh many times as as we were children, my father would sit us around on morning devotions and uh well he would he would have us memorize scripture. And I think that's good. How many knows that it's good to memorize scripture? Well, you know, we didn't know that at uh at our childhood the Lord would use us for the ministry, but this is one of my favorite scriptures, and I thought I'd share it with you this evening. &gt;&gt; Romans uh 12 verse 1. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, &gt;&gt; that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice. Holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable. Can you say that we with me? Reasonable service. I want you to see here that God is not asking us to do anything unreasonable. &gt;&gt; And be not conformed to this world, &gt;&gt; but be ye transformed &gt;&gt; by the renewing of your mind, &gt;&gt; that ye may prove what is that is good and acceptable and a perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. You may be seated. Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles then right away to 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 18. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are changed into his image, into his likeness by his spirit. &gt;&gt; Then if you could go over to Philippians chapter 14, Paul the Apostle speaking to the Philippians who he loved dearly and he says these words, "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended." what he's saying that you know I I don't have it all there together but this one thing I want to TELL YOU &gt;&gt; BUT THIS ONE THING I do &gt;&gt; forgetting those things which are behind &gt;&gt; and reaching forth unto those things which are before &gt;&gt; we don't always want to just look behind us &gt;&gt; we our testimony is not about just what's behind us &gt;&gt; but we want to look forward Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to see what God is doing presently and we want to see what God is going to do for us &gt;&gt; in the future. &gt;&gt; Then verse 14, I like this so much. HE SAYS, "I PRESS towards the mark." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just a slow meander. It's a pressing. &gt;&gt; And we'll SPEAK THIS EVENING. WE WANT TO PRESS as transformed people. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; My title of my message this is what one day we were once deformed brother Robert but now we have been transformed &gt;&gt; by the renewing of our minds and we're pressing forth towards the mark of the high calling &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to read you a quotation just before so you catch my thoughts. And as I was studying for this Wednesday meeting, brother had asked if I would speak and I and I took some time. I I really pressed in and I asked Lord, what would you like for the Wednesday evening? I and I believe nothing is by chance. &gt;&gt; I I I know that God is w wanting desiring to witness to our hearts to in encourage us this evening. And and brother Brandon would say in this message witnesses in 1956 he would says I'm happy tonight that there's people here who can witness the same thing. I once was lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. We were all there. &gt;&gt; I ONCE WAS LOST BUT NOW I'M FOUND. &gt;&gt; We were ALL IN A PAWN SHOP ONE DAY. There was one that came by and took us out of that pawn shop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M FOUND. I WAS DEAD, BUT NOW I'M ALIVE. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would say, "We are quickened. We are made alive." Amen. &gt;&gt; A witness of those resurrecting power that came that can take a vile sinner and can transform their whole being and take their their emotions and their ideas and their thoughts. I say, Lord, take my thoughts and take their thoughts and change them into an eternal hope. This evening, I want us to see that we're an eternal people. &gt;&gt; FOR INSIDE OF our very being is the eternal God &gt;&gt; and eternal life that's with inside of us. &gt;&gt; And so, as you can see in our scripture reading that I like to speak these on these words, transformed. &gt;&gt; Now, that word transformed, it it means to be changed. It means to be made different. It literally means that your character itself has been changed. And not only changed, it has been put into service. &gt;&gt; What good would it be if we were only a people that were changed? But we want to be those that are in service for Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would teach us and explain to us in the message of the countdown. He would say, "You have been born again. You have received the new birth." And then THE HOLY GHOST, THE POWER comes into that birth for service. So we are here today and I believe that most of us here in the building have had an experience with God. I believe that we are mature believers. But I I do believe that God wants us to remind oursel of of what he's done for us in our lives. and those THAT MAYBE HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED THAT GOD would move in their beings that they would collectively come to the presence of God and be changed. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that God is a transforming changing? &gt;&gt; Oh, we desire change inside of our lives. &gt;&gt; NOW, WHEN GOD CHANGES OUR CHARACTER, when he when he molds us, when he when he makes us, HE HE'S NOT JUST polishing us up. He's not just patching us up. NO, HE'S NOT JUST MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS. But I I believe with all of my heart that he is complete, it's a complete work. He's completely and divinely changing us for his service. &gt;&gt; If I could just for a moment, if I could just emphasize that for you just a moment. There is only one power that can truly transform us and that is the power by the word of God &gt;&gt; and that is by the Holy Ghost. That's by God's very own life. &gt;&gt; Now man can educate. &gt;&gt; Men would like us to take the scripture and compare scripture with scripture and we can take quotations and we can memorize those as well. And many times we would get together around the coffee table. Each one of us would give a thought or we would we would share something that we have maybe memorized but and or maybe educated ourselves into. But God God's work, God's changing, God's transforming power is not an education. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many times I think the believer comes to a place of education. I think many times that we figure if we could just memorize or we could just grasp the just just by education some of the good gospel truths that God would accept us. But no friend, God wants to mold us, to change us, make us a new &gt;&gt; society, church community can regulate you. &gt;&gt; I I've seen it most of my Christian life. Many times people come and they they'll come to church for years, brother Dom. that they'll come to church and sit in a under a good ministry. They'll they'll come and and they'll they'll do the dos and don'ts of what we would CALL THE MESSAGE, BUT NOTHING'S ever really changed in their life. THEY MAYBE COMETH TO JUSTIFICATION and we find them repenting of every sin and they cry out to the Lord. MAYBE THEY EVEN COME TO A PLACE of sanctification where they're washed, but they don't ever go far there to receive the Holy Ghost life and the society or their community begins to regulate how they move and adjust in their lives. &gt;&gt; We could see that religion, brother Brandham preaches against and he says, "Come out of her my people." He speaks against denominational system. BUT IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE COULD FIND OURSELVES GETTING INTO A DENOMINATIONAL THOUGHT RIGHT IN OUR OWN MIDST, WHICH WE WOULD CALL the message. What a blessed word to say, I AM IN THE MESSAGE. BUT IF IT HAS BECOME A TITLE OF A DENOMINATION for you and I, we have missed what God is trying to do. &gt;&gt; I have a little maybe if the the brothers have a picture there, I have a little illustration. Brother Brandham talks about a hog. And he says a sinner is a sinner. You know, JUST LIKE A HOG CAN'T BE NOTHING else but a hog. &gt;&gt; THOSE FELLAS THERE, THEY they're hogs. And I hope you don't mind me having a picture like that in the church, but sometimes it gets into our minds. You know, Brother Brandon would say that you can take THAT FELL AND WASH HIM up and dress him up and put some anointing smells upon him and bring him on into the house, but that pog will always be a hawk. &gt;&gt; And I don't care. I say that very not sternly, but I I want to say LIKE IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME HOW MUCH education you have. &gt;&gt; If you don't know the author real well, you're still a sinner. If you're just going according to the community friend, you're still a sinner. If religion is all you got, you're still a sinner. That hog, he likes to root around. He he pushes his note down nose down into that filth. He's there on Monday through Saturday in the filth of the world. He's digging and rooting in the worldly music. Come on, somebody. He's digging and rooting around the entertainments of this world. He's there looking in the filth AND THE GARBAGE. WHY? BECAUSE he is a pig. &gt;&gt; The hig THE HOG IS ONLY LIVING ACCORDING to his nature. He he he's trying to HE'S JUST TRYING TO FIND WHAT HE CAN SOME LITTLE THINGS. AND WE can't res we can't scold him. We we can't be angry at him. The prophet would say we can't reform him. He's doing exactly as God has called him to do as a hog. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I look at our lives. We know that we were all born in sin. Just take a moment back and realize where you came from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were born in sin and shaped in iniquity. YOU WERE A SINNER, BUT GOD CAME and saved you by HIS GRACE. LET ME JUST REMIND WE DON'T PREACH THIS WAY OFTEN, BUT I I want to JUST GO SIMPLY TO REMIND US THAT GOD in his gratefulness has come by his mercies &gt;&gt; and transformed us from a beast. &gt;&gt; WE ALL are beastly natured. &gt;&gt; WE ALL HAD SOMETHING INSIDE OF THAT WAS NEGATIVE. BUT GOD BY HIS GRACE, HIS MERCY as the scripture has said has come in our lives and the the transforming power of God has changed us. &gt;&gt; And so my prayer today as I'm preaching to you, even to myself, Lord, let the power of the Holy Ghost begin to lead us as the great shepherd. &gt;&gt; Do you remember David in the 23rd Psalm? He he was speaking and he's the great he's speaking of the great shepherd. In verse 5, HE SAYS, "THOU ANOINTEST my head with oil and my cup runth over." &gt;&gt; Now, David in 1st Samuel chapter 16:E3, he was anointed from the horn of oil. There Samuel came and I don't want to go through the story, but you recall it very Samuel came and brought the boys before him and brought David out of the field. him there. David was anointed with the horn of oil and the spirit of the Lord came upon David. How many remembers that in the scripture? &gt;&gt; And so I like to make this statement asking you the question, DO YOU KNOW for assurityity that you have been anointed by the horn with the Holy Ghost and power? &gt;&gt; Have you really really come to a place where you know that you're changed? that you come to a re of birth, but not just a re been reborn, but the Holy Ghost power is living and acting through your life, and you're moving in God's direction. You're doing exactly what God has called you to do. &gt;&gt; We're not all pulpit ministries, but we are all ministers before the Lord. And God is calling us to DO SOMETHING TODAY. GOD IS ASKING US TO BE A MINISTER before him, but you need the power to come before &gt;&gt; you and guide you and lead you in all truth. &gt;&gt; And so I want you to see that it's not just an anointing in our flesh. And we we don't want to ride a dead horse this evening speaking about our flesh, but I just want you to understand it's not about our flesh. It's not about how our flesh gets anointed, BUT IT'S WHAT GOD DOES IN THE DEPTHS OF OUR soul that the anointed word, THAT SEED WORD OF GOD IS MOVING AND IT'S expressing itself through your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many's experienced that before? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, there was an occasion I was a young man. My wife and I traveled up into Ontario to some special meetings and and you know, uh uh there was a a wonderful brother, brother Steven Francis, that was speaking there in that meeting. And I was sitting sort of in the mid congregation and as he was preaching the word of God and he was teaching and it and it was strong and and I was listening and I I want to say something in the side of me b to bubble as the word was begin to preach. It was not my flesh. It wasn't the music. It wasn't the atmosphere that somebody could make, but it was the word that begin to change on the inside of the inside. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT begin to bubble with inside OF ME. AND THAT IS THE SEED WORD THAT does it in the midst of the house of God. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we're used to coming to the services and and and we become spectators. I I I want to say I'm the first ones sometimes on a Wednesday night when you're tired. &gt;&gt; Anybody tired on a Wednesday? &gt;&gt; Well, sure we are. We get good and tired and we've worked hard all day and sometimes we're just going to come and it's like I'm going to buy a ticket to the service and I'm just going to watch and the minister can just, you know, entertain me for just a little and we'll go shake hands and it'll be wonderful because everybody's seen that I was dedicated. I came to church. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah, you're all the same. I'm just like you. And that's how we are. &gt;&gt; BUT WE DIDN'T COME TO BE ENTERTAINED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE COME TO PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Some of us say, "Amen." Hallelujah. RAISE A HAND. OTHERS SAY, "AMEN." SOME might clap their hands. Some might grin. THAT'S ALL FINE AS long as you're letting the word be expressed through your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seed word coming into being right in the house of God. And so we are anointed now to serve God. We are anointed to take dominion. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS HAS CALLED US TO TAKE AUTHORITY over the enemy. &gt;&gt; That's why we sing a wonderful song like we believe Lord and we PUT YOUR WORD TO ACTION. WHATEVER IT IS, WE believe Lord that you can heal us from stomach trouble, from cancers, from things that so easily beset us. We can be healed in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And so David, he was anointed by the by the horn. He was anointed by the oil in the horn. It was resembling the the the Holy Ghost in his life. And just the SAME AS YOU AND I, David was anointed to be king. But you and I by faith have been anointed to be kings &gt;&gt; and priests before God. &gt;&gt; Can you catch that revelation? &gt;&gt; CAN YOU CATCH WHO YOU ARE? &gt;&gt; Predestinated sons of God. &gt;&gt; Revelations 5 10 would say it like this. And he has made US UNTO OUR GOD kings &gt;&gt; and priests. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These offices before God. and we shall reign on the earth. As a king AND AS A PRIEST, YOU MUST TAKE DOMINION. YOU MUST TAKE YOUR INHERITANCE. YOU MUST REALLY CATCH THE REVELATION WITH THAT LIFE, THAT TRANSFORMING POWER LIFE, THAT QUICK LIFE THAT YOU HAVE THE authority to speak &gt;&gt; and God will back what your words are if they're according to the word of God. Brother Brandon would say to us, you're you're not a Christian by desire. &gt;&gt; You're a Christian by God's &gt;&gt; desire. &gt;&gt; You've been anointed. The horn, the Holy SPIRIT HAS POURED OVER YOUR LIFE. THE GREAT SHEPHERD HAS ANOINTED YOU, YOUR HEAD WITH AR OIL IN YOUR LIFE IS TRANSFORMED, RENEWING BY your mind. I want you TO SEE THAT GOD HAS TRANSFORMED, CHANGED your life. BUT THERE ARE MANY TIMES THAT YOU'RE not mine needs to be renewed by the mercies of God. Every single day we need a renewing. &gt;&gt; Lord, renew us. &gt;&gt; His mercies make us new. Every morning we need to call upon the Lord just that way that the mind of Christ would reign and direct us in our everyday lives. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say a reality to dwell in a channel. THE REALITY TO DWELL in the channel of Christ. Now in 1954 in the message of witnesses, brother Bradam says you can't have the mind of Christ and the mind of the world at the same time. &gt;&gt; Now take a deep breath. I think this quotation is so good. I speak like in evangelistic tone just now and I hope you don't mind but you can't serve Christ and the world at the same time. &gt;&gt; You can't be in your own way and God's way at the same time. You have to get out of your own way to let God have his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message 1955 in water of separation, the mind of Christ in you. That's the only way I can stay alive. &gt;&gt; Now, he's not talking just about this mortal life. He's talking OUR SPIRITUAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; HE'S TALKING ABOUT THAT MIND OF CHRIST. We must to enter into his mind daily. We need to dig into the word of God AND ALLOW THE MESSAGE OF THIS hour that we all love so dearly &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; begin to teach us and lead us and direct us. Many times we have what we have as digital devices and and you know we all have good intentions of entering into the digital device and reading the message or reading our Bibles but somehow with the devices we get so distracted. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, when I say amen, I I I want to say amen too. Amen, brother Steve. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're distracted by these DEVICES AND SOMETIMES GOD'S GOT TO settle us down and we need to take the word and open it up and not go to YouTube to see what it says or some other minister says. LET'S SEE WHAT GOD SAYS THROUGH THE prophet's voice. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart &gt;&gt; because we need to be able to stay alive in this time of darkness. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God hovered over the earth in Genesis chapter 1. &gt;&gt; And now I'm asking the Lord that he would come and hover over a people, over believers today. &gt;&gt; That he would speak his word into our lives that will quicken seeds with inside of us. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST BECAUSE WE HEARD some information, BUT LORD, QUICKEN IT. BRING IT TO LIFE. BRING IT TO REAL REVELATION inside of us. Make it part of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the natural, we say, "You are what you eat." &gt;&gt; Allow it to be that the word of God, we're feasting upon it, AND IT BECOMES EXACTLY WHO WE ARE. &gt;&gt; We don't have to FALSIFY ANY DOCUMENTS. WE DON'T HAVE TO TRY TO PRODUCE evidence that we're Christians. I pray, I really pray that if there was something that would convict me or or cause me to be uh convicted, it would be that I would be a real SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT ALL you could see IS JESUS. THAT ALL I COULD SEE INSIDE OF YOU. THAT WOULD BE THAT the world would convict me and and say something who I am. They would say Jesus Christ lives in a people. Jesus Christ lives in me. Quicken the seed word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, we are anointed. I want to show you this now that we are anointed from the horn of salvation. In Luke chapter 1:69, it says that he has raised up a horn of salvation. In the Old Testament, there's some language that we use and it references Jesus Christ as the strong one as God. HE'S OUT OF THE HORN, IT SPEAKS comes forth Christ, the anointed one. OUT OF THAT HORN COMES FORTH the seven compound names of God. &gt;&gt; Now you know something. I I I was quite amazed on Sunday when I was sitting just over here and listening to the word of God intently and brother Ron you been to go and speak about the seven compound names of God. And you know I had them in my notes and I thought for oh Lord Brother Ron's going to go all the way down and preach my notes on the seven comp compound names of God. But you know how God works divinely. And we want to see here that God works in these names. Jehovah Gyra that provides all of our needs. &gt;&gt; I still need a God that provides my needs. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This world is pretty miserable, upset. Have you read the news lately? &gt;&gt; Things that are going on. I need a God that provides. &gt;&gt; I need Jehovah J Rafa, &gt;&gt; THE LORD THAT IS MY HEALER. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; More than ever now with the world and the science and brother Brown talks about science and the power transformation. He you KNOW WE NEED GOD TO COME AS OUR HEALER AND WE NEED TO TRUST HIM AS our healer. &gt;&gt; We need our Lord our peace. We need our Lord our banner. We need him that Lord who IS THERE. THE LORD of our righteousness. And we need the Lord our shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yay. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, &gt;&gt; I will fear no evil, for he is with me. &gt;&gt; His rod, his staff, they cover me. A rod that guides, a rod of correction. I need this this shepherd, the great shepherd to lead me along the way. &gt;&gt; You know, we talk about a valley and most of us know that, you know, we do most of our living in the valley. Brother Rando says we have mountain tops experiences and we have valleys. &gt;&gt; He talks about HOW THAT ALL OUR fruits would freeze up here on the mountain tops. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says most of the time we live in a valley. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look at the valley as a negative place to reside. A valley is a oh my that's where the trials and the test. But I want you to know you grow food in the valley. &gt;&gt; Children are birthed in the valley. THERE. ALL KINDS OF GOODNESS happens in the valley. And I begin to think of the prophecy that's spoken, how our Lord Jesus would come AND HE HE WOULD BRING THE MOUNTAINS LOW AND THE valleys high. &gt;&gt; And we find out that our Lord Jesus, he sits there on our daytoday life in the valley. He's with us there guiding AND LEAD US. THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A VALLEY OF DEATH, LOW IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A TRIAL, HE'S ALWAYS THERE LEADING US. THIS IS THE POWER THAT'S IN US. This is the ONE THAT IS GUIDING US this evening. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be a people that's anointed with formalism. &gt;&gt; How many wants to be just a formal people? &gt;&gt; NO, WE WANT TO WE DON'T WANT JUST THEOLOGY. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO BE ANOINTED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. You want to BE ANOINTED BY THE HORN OF GOD WHICH WE SAID OUT OF THE HORN WHICH SPEAKS OF CHRIST. You see man, they always try to shift for themselves. The prophet would say always trying to do their own thing, ALWAYS TRYING TO HELP GOD. But I I want you to see in Samuel chapter 89, we won't go into it fully, but we see that Israel, you know, they they so desired to have a king. They so desired TO TO BE LIKE THE other nations. THEY THEY THEY THEY WANTED EVERYTHING LIKE THE OTHERS HAD. Many times we see that in our own assemblies. We want to look like the denominational churches. WE WE WE WANT TO HAVE THE platforms the same. We want the music's the same. We want to we want to just have everything that looks so good. And but REMEMBER ABEL'S altar was the bleeding lamb. ABEL'S ALTAR. WE COME TO THIS HOUSE. I COME TO this place not to be entertained to buy A TICKET. I I come here to see the believing word of God. I COME TO HEAR FOR ONE PURPOSE, &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS TO HAVE GOD'S AUTHORITY TO SPEAK INTO MY LIFE, TO LEAD ME, TO TEACH ME, TO GUIDE ME, TO ALLOW THAT WORD TO BUBBLE UP THROUGH MY LIFE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so, Israel wanted to have a king. They wanted to be like the other nations. And Samuel was he felt rejected. And Samuel came before the Lord. And the Lord spoke to him and said, "Samuel, they haven't rejected you. &gt;&gt; They have rejected me." &gt;&gt; SO MY HEART GETS SMOKED. LORD, I I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS ATTITUDE WHERE I WANT TO BE LIKE THE WORLD OR DENOMINATIONAL. I DON'T WANT TO REJECT YOU, LORD. I WANT TO HAVE YOU LEAD ME, FATHER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And so Samuel was spoken and told to the Lord that he should go anoint Saul a king after the people after their own desires. So I asked THAT QUESTION AND HOW DID HE DO IT? Did Samuel go do and anoint Saul? Well, in 1st Samuel 10:1, the Bible says, "Then Samuel took a vial." I want you to see that vial is a flask. It's a bottle filled with oil. And he poured it upon the head of Saul. NOW NOTICE that vial, THAT FLASK, that bottle was a man-made container. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE IS NOT BY ACCIDENTING writing and saying they took a A A FLASK. NO. IN DAVID, YOU'LL READ IT IN JUST a moment. For David, he brought the horn. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; FOR DAVID, HE BROUGHT the horn that was filled with oil. And that horn has a representation BECAUSE WE SEE IT NOW IN THE BOOK OF LUKE OUT FROM IT'S CHRIST. THE HORN COMES FORTH. The spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And so, we don't want a man-made anointing. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; We want God's anointing to come IN OUR LIVES. WE DON'T WANT JUST A FLASH IN THE PAN AS THE brother brother Brandon would say &gt;&gt; and trying to do God a service without his will. &gt;&gt; Remember the HOLY SPIRIT CAN COME AND ANOINT A person and still it's out of THE WILL OF GOD. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE? &gt;&gt; SAUL WAS KING. HE WAS ANOINTED. GOD SPOKE SAID, "HEY, ANOINT SAUL." BUT IT WAS NOT GOD'S PERFECT WILL. We don't want to be drinking from a man-made container. &gt;&gt; We want to be drinking from what God has called us to drink from. &gt;&gt; God commissioning Moses, Saul found out that that theological vest of his did not fit a fit a man of God. And it usually it don't. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Our theologies. A lot of times we'll get up here and many times men will quote theology and there's no power of God behind it. &gt;&gt; We have to ask the Lord, Lord, let the power come and spill upon your people. &gt;&gt; Remember, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FLESH NOW. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WORD THAT STIMULATES OUR LIVES TO GROW FURTHER &gt;&gt; INTO THE GOSPEL, FURTHER INTO THE WORD. NOT JUST TEACHING BY education that we can UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT NO LORD REAL REVELATION DIVINE teaching &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The oil it causes us to thirst. It causes us to thirst more of God's presence as a deer pandeth after the water. So my soul longs after thee, oh God. &gt;&gt; Well, that's how we feel this evening. I'm sure most of us in the congregation. There's a deep calling to a deep with inside and there is a deep to respond. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's why we're all here today. &gt;&gt; Why on the Wednesday night when you're tired, why would you come? But you have a deep calling. Lord, we want more &gt;&gt; of you. &gt;&gt; And so Samuel when he pours that oil upon David, he pours it upon him unsparingly upon him. He pours it from THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND DRIPS down his face onto his shoulders as it would be like THE PRIEST BEING ANOINTED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HIS PAPS down to his feet. And brother Brandon was saying the great warrior David said, "And that's THE WAY THAT GOD pours the Holy Ghost on a man, &gt;&gt; not sparingly, &gt;&gt; just baptizes HIM INTO IT, ANOINTING HIM WITH the spirit." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice as it hit David, IT STRUCK DAVID, IT TORN DOWN HIS HIS HIS head down to his feet. It began to positionally place him as a king. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we want the oil of the Holy Ghost to strike us that way that we would allow the Holy Spirit to guide us and and bring us into a place OF OUR ADOPTION TO KNOW EXACTLY who we are. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. YES, SIR. WHEN THIS oil comes upon you, I want to speak naturally to you. YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR PAST LIFE does not define you. &gt;&gt; Lots of times we have a past and we have things that we carry like baggage upon our shoulders and we and we limp around with that baggage on and on and on in our lives. And until we let THAT THING GO, GOD CAN'T FURTHER us into the kingdom of God. Your weaknesses DO NOT DISQUALIFY YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD USES YOUR WEAKNESS for his his glory. I CAN DO ALL things through Christ who strengthens me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your limitations don't restrict God. WHATEVER YOU FEEL YOUR LIMITATION might be, CAST THAT ASIDE. GOD WANTS to use you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to think about and be complexed ABOUT YOUR LIMITATIONS. ALLOW GOD, resist the devil AND ALLOW THE GOD OF HEAVEN TO USE YOU IN ALL THAT YOU ARE purposed for &gt;&gt; because the oil of the Holy Spirit is poured upon your life. &gt;&gt; Do you remember in Genesis chapter 1, we find that on the earth it was earth was in a a condition where that no human could ever fix. The Bible said that the world was without form and void and darkness was on the face of the deep. BUT THAT'S WHEN GOD DOES HIS BEST. THAT'S WHEN GOD BEGINS TO SPEAK AND GOD SAID, "LET THERE BE." AND immediately it came about and begin to happen. And the scripture says the spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the waters. &gt;&gt; The face OF THE WATERS. THERE. IT WAS ALL THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT VOID. IT WAS IT WAS A PLACE OF CHAOS UNTIL THE LOGOS OF GOD be to move upon the face of the earth. Brother Brandon was saying in impersonation of Christianity, he said the Holy Spirit brood it out on the earth and he kept brooding. I want you to notice those words brooding. I like it. And as he cooed, I also like that word couped. As he cooed and brewed, it began TO SEE TREES COME UP, birds fly from the earth, ANIMALS BEGIN TO WALK. AND THEN HE KEPT ON couping and man came up called Adam. &gt;&gt; Now I I just cuz who I am, I I looked up those words trying to figure out what coup and brood means. And we find that coup that speaks about uh you know uh talking fondly and the sound of of a content dove. I think that's the nature of a real believer. &gt;&gt; Somebody that's positive. &gt;&gt; We got a lot of negativity around. &gt;&gt; Negativity back and forth and unhappiness back and forth and I don't like this and I don't like that. And well, we have that in Washington. And I maybe not here in Phoenix, but we got that. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S PRESENCE AMONGST HIS PEOPLE. AND WE ALL SAY WE'RE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. THERE SHOULDN'T BE THIS NEGATIVITY THAT BREATHES AMONGST PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; We should HAVE THE LOVE OF GOD IN ABUNDANCE IN OUR HEARTS. WHY? BECAUSE IT H WE CARRY THAT REPRESENTATION OF HIS SPIRIT. HE COOED. HE SPOKE FONDLY AS A SOUND OF A CONTENT DOVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brooding it means showing deep happiness &gt;&gt; of a thought. &gt;&gt; So when the spirit of God begin to move upon the face of the earth, the whole picture began to change. &gt;&gt; Well, you think of your own life. You think about when the Holy Spirit begin to move upon your life, begin to coup and brute UPON YOUR LIFE. THE PICTURE OF YOUR LIFE BEGIN to change. &gt;&gt; Amen. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; SO, I SEE THAT IN ORDER for a seed to grow, &gt;&gt; it needs to have sir &gt;&gt; good conditions, &gt;&gt; good ground, &gt;&gt; and it needs TO HAVE A GODLY wordbased atmosphere &gt;&gt; for a seed to grow. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO UNDER THIS ATMOSPHERE, every seed that God spoke WOULD COME FORTH OF ITS KIND. &gt;&gt; I'd like to linger here for just a moment so you can really think because this is about you. &gt;&gt; You're the seed OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU COME forth out of the loins of God. And under every good atmosphere OF THE WORD, EVERY SEED WILL come forth. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Steve, my children are we are we wayward." Bring them to church. &gt;&gt; The atmosphere OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IS RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING. I don't know if you sense it this evening, but the Holy Spirit is with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right here in the building. &gt;&gt; BRING YOUR FAMILIES. BRING YOUR LIVES. IF YOU HAVE UPSET IN YOUR LIFE, BRING IT TO THE LORD. COME TO CHURCH. DON'T MISS IT. DON'T STREAM. DON'T YOU FIND YOURSELF OUT THERE IN THE INTER WORD INTERNET LAND. FIND YOURSELF IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE LOGOS WORD. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Atmosphere matters. &gt;&gt; Because every seed, I want you to KNOW THIS IN GENESIS, every seed already was in the ground. The prophet teaches us so eloquently. Genesis 1:1, in the beginning, God created. PERIOD. SO EVERYTHING WAS INSIDE OF THE GROUND, BUT WHAT IT NEEDED WAS WARMTH. IT NEEDED THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE for the seeds to come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I could just for a moment, I I I want us to think I I have a a personal illustration that I want to bring to you. Family and I, we went on a little vacation, and I have a picture of it, right, of something like it that we went to. We went to something called a butterfly conservatory. Now, in my manly self, I'm a little ashamed to tell you that I went, but but uh for the sake of the illustration, I I'm putting myself out there, but I I'll say it like this, brothers. I was dragged by my wife. So we went to this conservatory and the conservatory as you can see it was lush. It was tropical. It was warm. Now as many you know I I I went you go through a door &gt;&gt; and then they have these plastic sheets and you you go through the plastic sheets. Oh, I see some of the men nodding that you're all as manly as me. You all went. So you go THROUGH THIS AND IMMEDIATELY you feel warmth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you feel the humidity of the air, &gt;&gt; AND YOU FIND OUT, you smell around and it smells like blossoming flowers. &gt;&gt; You look with your sight and you see that the trees are thriving &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S COOL TRICKLING WATER AND PONDS AND STREAMS. AND INSIDE OF THE POND, IT'S NOT JUST A STAGGERING SISTN, but it IT'S FULL OF LIFE. IT'S TEEMING WITH LIFE. IT HAS STRENGTH WITH IT. I WANT YOU TO SEE RIGHT THERE. THE ATMOSPHERE IS BUILT FOR SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; I believe that our lives should be just like this. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OUR LIVES SHOULD BE SO WARPED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD &gt;&gt; THAT PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE MISSING THE FACT THAT you're a believer. &gt;&gt; You go to the work sites and immediately you don't have to say a word, but the other men they curse and repent because oh I didn't mean they don't know you WERE A CHRISTIAN. THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU. BUT THERE IS A WARMTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. When you come into the house of God, you come and you walk through THOSE DOORS AND IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN LAY YOUR BURDENS DOWN. IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN PUT YOUR SWORD IN YOUR SHEATH. IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN OPEN YOUR HEART. IT'S NOT THAT YOU HAVE TO CLOSE EVERYTHING AND SAY, "I'M GUARDED." NO. DROP IT ALL IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Flowers blooming. The place is teeming with life. Your eyes see God's presence moving. It's the atmosphere that changes things. Brother Brandham in prayer many times but this is one occasion he says make the whole atmosphere Lord a creative atmosphere &gt;&gt; that let there be right here in the house of God you can have anything you desire &gt;&gt; you say well that was just for sister Hattie right she said the right words but NO WHEN YOU COME WITH THE RIGHT ATTITUDE BEFORE GOD AND SAY AMEN TO THE THUS SAYETH THE LORD ANYTHING YOU HAVE NEED OF IS YOURS YOU CAN HAVE IT THIS EVENING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; A creative atmosphere of the soul, one mind, one accord, one purpose. &gt;&gt; You see here that the atmosphere then will bring results. He continues to say, "And if every person here would get into one perfect harmony, &gt;&gt; one perfect harmony." You know, I I noticed, was it brother J brother uh Austin that was playing the piano today? You know, he played the chords and it was beautiful and he played really good in harmony to the other instruments and they played around with just nice music for us to hear. But if there was one little note that was out of place, we would notice it, wouldn't we? BUT GOD IS ASKING US FOR TO BE A PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME INTO A STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN. A PEOPLE THAT HAVE RAISED UP INTO A CAPSTONE MINISTRY THAT CAN LIVE IN ONE MIND UNDER THE SPIRIT OF THE WORD THAT CAN COME FORTH WITH because they have transforming power inside of our life. &gt;&gt; We would get in perfect harmony. It would be settled. See, like the natural way of an egg is hatched is put under the hand. It'll hatch because it's the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; It's warm. Now, let's just look back to my conservatory illustration for just a moment. This uh conservatory, I want you to notice that it it exists for only one reason, and that is to produce butterflies. Look at this next picture I want to show you. Butterflies. beautiful butterflies under this ATMOSPHERE THAT WE LOOKED AT JUST BEFORE. Something happens with inside of this insect BEFORE IT BECOMES A BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY. SOMETHING IN ITS LIFE IS TRIGGERED. IT'S A IT'S A DYNAMIC CHANGE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Something is imprinted in the next picture into this little fella. Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This guy does not look like that butterfly. &gt;&gt; When we were little kids, we looked to find them, pick them off the trees, and and uh THESE GUYS ARE NOT BEAUTIFUL, BUT THE LAST PICTURE YOU WOULD ALL SAY IS GORGEOUS. &gt;&gt; In fact, I stood there chasing with a popsicle stick and sugar. Gorgeous. But something is on the inside of that LITTLE WORM. &gt;&gt; AND AS HE'S INCHING in the forest, as he's inching, just going climbing the trees and eating, he in his heart, something is calling him to the sky. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING'S TELLING HIM HE DOESN'T BELONG AS A WORM. SOMETHING IS ANOINTING HIM FOR CHANGE &gt;&gt; JUST AS IT IS IN OUR LIVES. THERE'S A LAW OF THE SEED inside of our lives &gt;&gt; just it WAS IN THE BEGINNING. ALL THAT'S WITH INSIDE OF YOU LAYS THERE AND IT MAY BE DORMANT FOR A SEASON. It may be a mystery TO YOU. BUT WHEN GOD BEGINS TO OPEN THAT WHICH IS IN YOUR LIFE, IT COMES FORTH. YOU ONCE WERE A WORM. YOU ONCE WERE A P PERSON THAT WAS DEFORMED, BUT NOW YOU HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THE RENEWING OF YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; OH, everything that was once buried in the water lay there in a mystery. But as we even heard on Sunday, that we find out that that great is the mystery of godliness. You and I recognize it's Christ in us, the hope of glory &gt;&gt; that has changed our life. I didn't understand it. I was born into a message home. I sat on the pew. I was just like all these fellas and I had to come to my own experience with God. But there was something that was calling me. I was wandering in a chicken barn and I was clucking with the hands. But something CALLED TO ME. YOU'RE NOT BORN FOR THIS BARNYARD. YOU'RE NOT JUST BORN TO FLY UP A ONE LITTLE PLACE OF A CHICKEN POST, BUT YOU ARE BORN FOR THE SKIES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Every seed will bring forth of its kind. Brother Brandon would emphasize saying an oak tree, it will bring forth an oak tree and a palm tree and a palm tree and we will come forth. We will come forth as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, brother Steve, I don't know. Too many weaknesses. I got too many hang-ups. I got too many complexes. I barely get from day to day. Find myself in so much spiritual depression. I I don't even know. I hardly can make it to the surface. But I I want you to know that God sees you like he would see that butterfly. &gt;&gt; He doesn't look at you at that wiggling worm. He doesn't look at you something that is unperfect. He doesn't look at you as one that's deformed. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; No, he looks at you that you've already been transformed. He looks at you like you're perfect in him. Every seed THAT HE PLANTED IN THE GARDEN WAS PERFECT. AND EVERY SEED THAT HE PUT UPON THIS EARTH THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE ADOPTION OF SONS IS PERFECT before him. &gt;&gt; Fact, when God spoke of you, he said it was very good. &gt;&gt; I want to gouge you today. I don't know if there's somebody in the building today, but it's put on my heart really strongly. It's put it to encourage the bride that you're perfect in Jesus Christ and you are good. Everything is good. Oh, brother, I'M FULL OF SIN. GOD WILL BRING YOU TO A MATURITY. GOD WILL BRING YOU TO A PLACE WHERE YOU ARE MEANT FOR THE SKIES. BUT KEEP PRESSING IN ONTO THE MARK OF THE HIGH calling &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, transform happens friends. It's a daily thing in our lives that we are being renewed. Now, Satan desires to to get you off your guard. He knows one thing is that he can't get to the womb of your soul because it's already sealed. &gt;&gt; He recognizes, BUT HE WILL TRY TO distract you. kind of like brother Brandham talks about walking in a corn field AND HE NOTICES THAT WHEN A LITTLE PIECE of corn OR A LITTLE SOMETHING THERE, YOU KNOW, THE THE STOCK there's a rock on it and and it begins to bend up and there's something deforming its way. BUT GOD KNOWS HOW TO TAKE THAT THING OFF OF YOUR LIFE. YOU MIGHT HAVE A SCAR AND YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING CROOKED THAT LOOKS CROOKED IN YOUR LIFE, BUT GOD'S NOT LOOKING AT THE CROOKED PARTS. &gt;&gt; GOD IS LOOKING AT THE FRUIT THAT COMES FORTH OUT OF YOUR LIFE. HE'S LOOKING AT THE SEED WORD THAT IS COMING FORTH IN manifestation upon your life. &gt;&gt; But it's so important today to guard our minds. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Does ever the enemy ever come and try to distract you in your thoughts? &gt;&gt; I just told you you're perfect before God. I told you that God loves you. I told you that you should not have a complex. OF SATAN WILL COME IN, SLIP ON into into your mind, and it begin to distract your mind. BUT IF I COULD GO JUST FOR A MOMENT BACK TO DAVID and how David was ANOINTED BY THE HORN OF THE OIL, I WANT YOU TO SEE THAT THE OIL WAS POURED UPON his head. &gt;&gt; Wasn't upon his feet. &gt;&gt; Wasn't upon his shoulders. No, it was upon his head. And that ALSO IS THE TYPE OF THE HELMET OF SALVATION THAT WOULD PROTECT OUR HEAD, our horn, JESUS CHRIST, PROTECTING OUR MIND. BECAUSE REMEMBER, WE'RE RENEWED BY WHAT? OUR MINDS. LORD, TRANSFORM US BY THE RENEWING THE MIND of Christ. &gt;&gt; Continually in a side of our lives. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, we ought to be protecting our head. Young men, protect your head. Protect your mind. boy, girl, man, woman, WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR MINDS because the mind, THE GREATEST BATTLE EVER FOUGHT IS IN OUR MINDS. &gt;&gt; Remember the pro, this is simple, but let me tell you, the prophet of God said, you're not responsible for the bird that flies over your head. YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NESTING it does. AND AND AND WE CAN'T ALLOW THE ENEMY TO NEST IN OUR MINDS, WHETHER IT BE IN THE FILTH OF THIS WORLD OR BY DOGMAS or creeds or doctrines. WE NEED TO STAY IN THE TRUTH OF THE DIVINE. SAY WHAT THE TAPES SAY. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; The mind is a battlefield. And Paul, he warns, "Be not conformed to this world." Don't put your life out there to be conformed to what we are presently calling the world. The world's pressures are on us are thick. But let's not think because as a man thinks in his IN HIS HEART, SO HE IS. &gt;&gt; WELL, I I just wonder sometimes while we're driving down the road, what are we thinking about it? We're in our trucks, in our cars, we're on the way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where is our mind? &gt;&gt; Where is it drifting to? Is your mind upon Christ? Maybe you're even listening or streaming another service and your mind is directed to all those things that are critical AND NOTHING POSITIVE. WHERE IS YOUR MIND? &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD. &gt;&gt; YOUR ONLY FOCUS TO BE IN THAT AREA IS NOT FOR MIND ENTERTAINMENT. It's to hear THE WORD OF GOD. LET THIS MIND BE IN YOU AS IT WAS IN CHRIST JESUS. FOCUS YOUR MIND UPON THE WORLD AND DO word and do not be conformed to this world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, the enemy is on a prowl and his desires to get at you. Now, remember we talked about the great shepherd and David was a shepherd. He often talked about shephering and you know in Palestine you find in the summertime they have a lot of flies and these flies they're nasal flies and they they you know I I did some research research and I find out that they they fly and they get up into the sheep inside of their nose and it causes inflammation and infection and that infection can often LEAD TO BLINDNESS OR IT CAN KEEP THE sheep from eating. King, I have a spiritual principle behind all of this. When these nasal flies get in the nose of the sheep causing infection, it could cause blindness or keep the sheep from eating. NOW, NOTICE THE BIBLE SPEAKS OF SATAN being Belzeub, the lord of the flies. AND SATAN KNOWS THAT THE WOMB OF YOUR HEART, AS I SAID MOMENT AGO, IS SEALED. BUT HE WILL IRRITATE YOU AND BRING INFECTION TO YOUR LIFE SO THAT IT WILL CAUSE YOU TO HAVE SPIRITUAL BLINDNESS. YOU WILL WALK AROUND WITH EYES OPEN SERVICE AFTER SERVICE, BUT YET BE BLIND AS SAMSON WAS. AND YOU WILL HAVE TO COME TO A PLACE AND SAY, "LORD, ONCE MORE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. If you allow Satan, the lord of the flies, bleub to come into your life, that way you may even come to a place where you stop eating of the word. &gt;&gt; It comes in, but doesn't drop to the heart. &gt;&gt; You know, the enemy tries, but the Bible gives us a remedy for those that are sick naturally and spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you like to hear what that is? Amen. &gt;&gt; Simply in James 5:14, "If any be sick among you, LET HIM CALL FOR THE ELDERS of the church and let them pray over him, ANOINTING HIM WITH OIL, THE SYMBOL OF THE HOLY GHOST IN OUR LIVES." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; In the NAME OF THE LORD, AND THE PRAYER AFFAIRS SHALL SAVE THE SICK, AND THE LORD SHALL RAISE HIM UP. ISN'T THAT THE PROMISE? spiritual blindness removed, &gt;&gt; your appetite restored, &gt;&gt; and if any have committed sins, they shall be forgiven. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Just as you never did it in the sea of God's forgetfulness. We we need to come to this PLACE WHERE WE HUMBLE OURSELVES AND RECOGNIZE, LORD, THE ENEMY HAS STRUCK UP INFECTION AND I'M NOT FEEDING AND I KNOW THAT I NEED THE OIL BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY THING THE SHEPHERD DOES IN Palestine is HE POURS OIL ALL OVER THE SHEEP OVER his head in order to keep the flies away. WE NEED CHRIST TO ANOINT US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Paul in Romans 12:1 is beseeching. You have a few minutes yet for me? &gt;&gt; I I promise I won't be long. &gt;&gt; But Paul is beseeching. He's pleading urgent urgency for us to surrender. He's saying, I plead to you that you ARE NOT CONFORMED. I PLEAD TO YOU THAT YOU PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE, NOT A DEAD ONE AS THE OLD TESTAMENT SACRIFICES, BUT A DAYTO-DAY LIVING SACRIFICE before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. an everyday life before God because an everyday life needs to press forward to the mark. &gt;&gt; We're in our last part of the scripture now. Pressing forth. I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God IN CHRIST. WE'RE PRESSING FORWARD LIKE AN ATHLETE. &gt;&gt; WELL, the Bible often compares our faith to running a race. How many knows that? A race demands focus. &gt;&gt; Runners, you have to focus. In a sport, no one wins by quitting halfway. &gt;&gt; We get tired. WE CAN'T KEEP RUNNING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AN ATHLETE, THEY TRAIN LONG. THEY TRAIN HARD. &gt;&gt; They wake up early. My these are spiritual applications I'm trying to bring to you in the natural. But look at them spiritually. THEY WAKE UP early &gt;&gt; and they train hard and they repeat it over. &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine? We don't have the Olympics going on, but those people, they train and train and train and train to run one event, maybe two events, and they did it their whole life. And someone, let's say the 100 meter, it's over in seconds. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TRAINING. WE'RE IN A BATTLE. WE'RE TRAINING. WE OUGHT TO BEGIN TO HAVE SOME endurance &gt;&gt; to get into the word of God. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm not against this, but some of us have these little boxes with our little daily bread, little papers in them. &gt;&gt; Well, I have one on the piano and and you know, we walk by sometimes in the morning. Lord, I don't have time to read a whole chapter today because I slept in last night. We were up with the friends and we're, you know, playing disc golf or Top Golf and we were all having fellowship and brothers, you know, they want me to come at 7 a.m. in the morning for breakfast. How ridiculous was that? You know who you are. I hold brother Don Saunders personally responsible for that. &gt;&gt; So what do we do sometimes? We go over to those little things. We pull a little marker and we read a one sentence and WE SAY, "LORD, BLESS us this day." And we say, "We've done our devotion, our due diligence before the Lord." &gt;&gt; You think you're going to win a race? &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; NO. WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME DILIGENCE, some some directive, SOME TO REPEAT THE DRILLS AND PUSH THROUGH THE PAIN WHEN IT HURTS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T FEEL GOOD. SOMETIMES WE HAVE A GLORY TIME AT CHURCH AND OTHER TIMES IT'S SLUGGING. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS FEEL GOOD. &gt;&gt; But we have to fix our eyes not on our circumstance, but on the finish line. &gt;&gt; MY GOAL. THERE'S A PRIZE BEFORE. THERE'S A GOAL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK ABOUT A SOLDIER JUST NOW. A SOLDIER, HE CAN'T BE A a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a CRY BABY. HE'S GOT TO BE FIRM AND SOLID AND AND FULL OF VIGOR. HE HAS TO KNOW THAT HE'S FIGHTING FOR A PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT TO REALIZE THAT WAR IS DANGEROUS, BUT YET HE'S THERE WILLING AS HE'S TRAINED TO DEFEND. HE HAS DESIRED TO ADVANCE, NOT RETREAT. It doesn't say the first part of his playbook at the very sight of the enemy run. &gt;&gt; A CHRISTIAN, THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE FULLY ARMORED BY THE ARMOR OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE THAT WORD retreat in our hearts and our minds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's forward. &gt;&gt; Reminds me of a little story I heard one time. They were fighting a vigorous battle and they were against the enemy and it looked like they were going to lose and the great general he called out to to the trumpeter. You know, the trumpeter would blow either forward or retreat. And so he called out, "Retreat, RETREAT." AND THE BUGLER GOT OFF THE trumpet and he begin TO BLOW. AND THE THE company that was TO DEFENSE THE GOOD ARMY. THEY JUST WENT FORWARD AS HARD AS THEY COULD. The saving grace of it all was they won the battle. At the end, THE GENERAL CALLED THE BUGLER. AND he said, "For sir, I told you to retreat. I know we won the battle, BUT I CALLED YOU TO RETREAT. WHY IN THE WORLD DID YOU PLAY THE FORWARD?" &gt;&gt; All I knew. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. As the brother said, it was the only tune the bugler knew was forward. &gt;&gt; He didn't learn the retreat song. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When we sing songs in here, I WOULD NOT BE DENIED. I WOULD NOT BE DENIED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; UNTIL JESUS CAME AND HE MADE ME WHOLE. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT going to be denied. I'M GOING TO PRESS IN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's good. We have courage in obedience to the word OF GOD AND WE PRESS IN NO MATTER HOW WE QUAKE in fear. One more example brother Brandham uses and I won't tell the whole story but remember Arnold von Rickled Reed &gt;&gt; and if you're Dutch I'm or Swiss I'm sorry that I butchered that name but that fell HE TO THE SWISS people he he was a legend a legend of hope BECAUSE WHEN EVERYTHING LIKE IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS LOST and their families WOULD BE KILLED THEIR FARMS would be burned There was one MAN &gt;&gt; BY THE NAME OF ARNOLD WHO WAS WILLING TO STEP OUT AND SAY, "LISTEN, MY SWISS BRETHREN, THIS DAY I GIVE MY LIFE for Switzerland &gt;&gt; and my home life land." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT OUR ATTITUDE SHOULD BE. THIS DAY I GIVE MY LIFE FOR MY COUNTRY. NOT FOR OUR NATURAL COUNTRY. BUT THIS DAY I HONOR, I STRIVE, I PRESS FORWARD FOR THE MARK OF THE HIGH CALLING. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST PRESS FORWARD FOR MY VOCATION. OH, I want to be a nurse or a doctor and a counter. I want to be a plumber, a carpenter, or a painter. NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE PRESSING FOR. THOSE ARE VOCATIONS. VOCATIONS. We have to do those things in order TO GO BY. BUT OUR FIRST HOPE, OUR FIRST HALLELUJAH, OUR FIRST DESIRE, &gt;&gt; MY ONLY DESIRE IS JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; IN HIM ALONE, I PRESS FORWARD. &gt;&gt; WHY? Because once I was a sinner. Once I was a hog. Once I was like that beastly thing that was on THE PICTURE, FULL OF SIN. BUT JESUS came in and he took my life. And he just didn't POLISH IT UP. HE JUST DIDN'T JUST ADJUST IT, BUT HE CHANGED IT FOREVER. AND EVERY SINGLE DAY BY THE MERCIES OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BY GOD'S MERCY, HE RENEWS MY MIND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, we press forward. What are we pressing forward? Into the anointing of God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Into that logos anointing that said, "Let there be light." And it came about. We look for the oil of the Holy Ghost not to be poured upon our heads with a man-made system like a flask, but we say, "Lord, take the horn and take that oil and pour it upon our heads, which the horn is Jesus Christ." And then we realize, "Oh, God, we're not meant for this world." &gt;&gt; I don't know, saints, we're not meant to build houses and build up lands. Sometimes I look at and friends, I'm not against striving to do well for our natural beings, but sometimes that seems to be the only focus on people's minds. &gt;&gt; They want to feel good and lay a sea of they want to have everything just check boxes, check, check, check, check, check. Then they come to church and they just want a feeling check, check, check, check. And they never want to press in or have any sort of discipline. But God is calling a people higher. You're not born to be a worm. &gt;&gt; LET SOMETHING STRIKE INSIDE YOUR BEING CALLED REVELATION THAT IS IMPRINTED THERE FROM THE BEGINNING. A SEED AFTER HIS OWN KIND TO SAY, "I AM A BUTTERFLY OR I AM AN EAGLE. I'M MEANT FOR THE SKIES." &gt;&gt; We must reach our high calling. Yes, &gt;&gt; we must reach the goal. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; many have gone before us. &gt;&gt; Many have died at the stake. Many have been reproached and they didn't have the full light like we have. But you and I, we're holding in our possession the open book, the revealed word of God. We have the portion in our hands and we're eating the book and our lives are living out the message of the hour. Friend, just don't squander and waste it. Don't let every everyday life just kind of overwhelm you. &gt;&gt; No. Come up higher. &gt;&gt; And sing with me the song as the musicians come. There is a change in me. &gt;&gt; Since Jesus has set me free. I'VE BEEN TO CALVARY. I've been born again. All this thing of this world, they're passed away. It's my flavor of it's long gone. the thoughts of the world, the intents of the world, whatever it might be, whatever your distraction might be, get rid of it in Jesus' name and come up a little higher &gt;&gt; in the purity of God's word. As the musicians begin to play that, there's been a change in me. Heavenly Father, I thank you for this opportunity. My heart is to encourage the people as they're well taught by a wonderful pastor to continue moving forward to press in Lord that their hearts would focus on the real thing, the main thing and not just things that are around them and how much they can earn and how much they can possess. But Lord, how much rather when we call upon your name, how you can come near us and give us more of your life and you begin to coup and woo over us and a seed comes forth and brings forth a a life, brings forth fruits of righteousness and holiness. We thank you, oh God, for this opportunity. I look around us, there are many people that would like to have this opportunity, but you came to a special people called from the beginning because their seed was in the ground and under the right atmosphere. Lord, it wasn't us doing the choosing. You called us and brought us forth. And now we are here joined with Jesus Christ, filled with the Holy Ghost, and come to a place of adoption. We thank you for that, Lord. &gt;&gt; But may we not squander it, Lord, with a wasteful life. May we push and press forward &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name &gt;&gt; there's you know the song you don't know the song that's okay brother Jonathan come and lead us in the song where stand to your feet let's sing this song that day playing father one more time if there There be somebody in the building, Lord, that needs a special touch from you. I pray, Father, that your spirit would go to them now and begin to move in their soil. Move upon the seed, Lord, that's in their life. It's burst open, Lord. May the sun the sen strengthen so the life may come forth Lord that it would come not just up a stalk and then to a tassel but there would be fruit upon it Lord that they would come to a place where their life is basking in the sun ripening Lord this is our desire if our mind has been clouded change us Lord I pray that the Lord if there'd be anybody in the building that would erase their hand and say, "Lord, be merciful to unto me and renew my mind. Lord, you've changed me, Lord. I'm assure of it. But renew my mind. Encourage me, Lord, that I might know that I'm perfect in you with a renewed mind every day, Brother Jonathan, in Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Spread your wings to the winds of faith. Spread your wings. Spread your wings to the winds of faith. You can fly in a higher place. Do not struggle. It's by grace. Set your wings to the wind of &gt;&gt; And let's sing. Shout to the Lord. Shout to the Lord.

Brother Raven knows if you could come close our service this morning in prayer. Amen, brother Ray. Amen. Let's bow our heads, Lord. Truly, Lord, we need your Holy Spirit.
