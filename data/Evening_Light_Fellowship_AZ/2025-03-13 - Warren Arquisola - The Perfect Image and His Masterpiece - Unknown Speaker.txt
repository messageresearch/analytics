bless you all I was talking to my friend last couple of weeks ago he was a minister from Pennsylvania and he heard that there was his the minister from Indiana left the message so he went there to rescue the brother and he was the one that left the message also but as for me and my house we will not go back how can we go back this is our life I don't want to go back where I came from this is life amen this message is Jesus Christ how can we go back hallelujah amen let's bow our heads father there's no way to go back the prophet said if the children are hungry yes they will go find food will in the garbage can that's right they're going back because there's no food they don't know how to dig but to us father you gave us food spiritual food in due season thank you Lord the house of God is full of food right now it's up to you take what you want it's all on the table Hallelujah father bless your people tonight I don't have a message but I ask you before I come out use my lips my whole being my everything because this is for your bride father thank you Lord we're just a servant of yours bless them Father I ask you Lord that this message will find their position in the body of Christ tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen the title of the [Music] message tonight the perfect image and his Masterpiece Hallelujah am Jesus Christ and his bride amen The Perfect Image and his Masterpiece amen Jesus Christ and his bride The Perfect Image is Jesus Christ his Masterpiece is the bride of Christ amen praise the Lord let's open our Bible Genesis chapter 27 this is the Masterpiece of God so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he them male and female created he them amen Psalms chapter 139 verse4 I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made amen that's God how he created us fearfully wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that's my soul knowth right well may the Lord are the blessings of the reading of his word you may be seated amen thank you for the opportunity brother Ron amen Pope Julius II was commissioned Michel Angelo to build to build his tomb in 1505 and it was finally completed in 1545 40 years in the making but then he didn't see his own tomb because he died in 1513 so but then Michel Angelo built this the the the statue of Moses it was 12T and 3 in I will show you the picture brother Brenham saw this from the Forest Lawn in California but that is the original in the uh Rome now that's the perfect image of Moses so brother Branham was preaching about this image that when Michel Angelo Angelo how do you pronounce it Angelo saw the Perfection of Moses he hammered the knee of Moses uh can you show that brother so that I cannot really see it but there there was a according to that uh historian there was a a a a flaw on that knee of Moses and not only that he he hit twice there was a damage also on the foot of Moses over there so according to the historian when he finished the statue of Moses he was it was so real to him and he talked to Moses but then when Moses wasn't answering he hammered the knee of Moses and screamed speak and that was the Masterpiece amen amen amen so but then we are talking right now to the Masterpiece of God I'm just showing that where brother Brenham took that Masterpiece the prophet said here in in the Masterpiece uh message he said so he set forth on his great piece of marble The Cutting to pattern and bringing down and hoing down until he got to the real picture of what it was have been in his mind remember it was in the mind of Michel Angelo and he keep projecting this for 40 years sweat hunger pain people are mocking him he caught the vision first and how he had to work to that Vision cutting up and making King down and when he got it in where he perfected it till it really got perfect he stood and looked at it when he finished up that morning with a hammer in his hand he was so inspired when he looked at it because the vision in his mind was standing before him him to all I always forget this my wife always tell me say thank you to the musician and to the brothers and sisters that are listening right now God bless you may this message touch her heart tonight amen amen and then in reality what he had seen his conception of what Michael of Moses was there it was figure before him what he had in his heart all these years and toils and hours of sorrow and distress and critics and everything else and then when it was completed he stood back with the sculptor hammer in his hand and he looked at that monument and he in uh the inspiration of that Vision that he he had seen of how to do it inspired him so much till he till the inspiration struck him till he got beside himself and struck it across the knee and said speak now there's a flaw on the great image on the knee on the right knee it's a beautiful picture of Moses how did he know the image of Moses because he cre ated that from his mind to the vision amen and to the vision to reality my brother but I was searching about the creation of God you know when Moses said in the beginning God created heaven and the Earth but the prophet said in the beginning beginning God was not God in the beginning God was not even God he was the great Eternal in there was attributes attributes was his thoughts and then he became a word like this and the word express well I thought Express a thought Express is a word a word express is a thought when he created he created himself first the logos the word and then remember if you ever was in God's thinking this is it you always be there amen if you got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute thank you Lord oh this thought for this age if not there is only one eternal life and it's always existed and you in his mind existed before there was a world there's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world Hallelujah that's why you told that sister Nancy I am Nancy Tempi I am the bride of Christ I came from the thought of God I am an eternal you can destroy this body but the inside of me will still praise God Amen that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it isn't what he think what somebody else thinks it's what God Eternal you always was in his thinking praise the Lord it was in him to be man that's the reason Christ was the express image The Perfect Image see he was to be the father he was to be the son he was to be savior he was to be healer there was nothing there wasn't even an angel or nothing then he created angels then he become God Amen Hallelujah he was worshiped then there are the manifestation of his thinking that's why brother why I will go back to the world I asked him are you a preacher right now to the denomination he said yes my friend from Pennsylvania he divorced his wife see what's the effect of leaving the message because he thought because of the mistakes I told him brother you were born in the message your father is a pastor in the message and then you you you you left the message you don't read the Bible all prophets has flaws all prophets has mistakes willfully mistakes but then the he said oh well brother you're too late I cannot go back that's right I tried to win you back but it's if you don't want it I said you're a you're a preacher in your church he said yes I'm preaching I said preach the word amen preach the godhead preach the the the the the um how do you call that the Holiness in the church maybe they're going to live everything in the message brother is in the Bible so the prophet explained this to us that God was not God from the very beginning how can he become God he God means object of worship how can be God if no one is worshiping him but then after he created an angel he became Jehovah Hallelujah I thank God for this message Malachi 4 is to restore all the Lo ends Revelation 10:7 all the mystery of God will be revealed am that's why there's no mystery to the bride it's all history when I was a young man young in the message I wasn't a preacher but I always struggle this scripture I always skip this scripture because I cannot understand it Genesis chapter 6 I was uh sharing this to brother Mario and uh brother James last week Genesis chapter 6 verse 5 to 7 I think I didn't uh put that in my so Genesis chapter 65 to 7 I was asking the ministers over there in the Philippines and they cannot explain it to me so I said for me but I praying I need to understand this Lord you said you know you will reveal this to me how can I share your word if this is not open to me and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination and of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the cripping things and the foul of the air for it repented me that I have made man and I cannot explain it if God is omniscient knows all things how he did not know what will going to happen to his creation why he repented so I check that in the diction uh in the uh Greek repented means na come to be sorry sorrowful God was sorry and sorrowful and I keep asking the elders when I was young brother Ron no one can explain it to me but then if you have question in your mind this is my advice as your brother wait on the Lord yes pray wait on the Lord pray wait on on the Lord and then one day I was in the United States already it's like this read it 8 brother and uh to 9 Genesis 6 8-9 here's the answer if there's a question of the scripture there's a scripture answered that's right but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord yes the the the the brother the iniquities are all over the place men are drinking men and women are like the same but then David found favor in the sight of the Lord hallelujah Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord amen these are the generation of Noah Noah was man and perfect in his generation and Noah walked with God yes in the eyes of the Lord he repented that I will destroy men but then God found favor God found Grace amen hallelujah Noah was perfect and was walking with God praise the Lord very very few the pro the the prophet said 500 will go to the rapture today no one knows no one knows because you know why because we're nobody's amen amen but in the eyes of the lord we are somebody thank you Lord Amen brother that's why we appreciate predestination right election I'm not going to let you uh go to this but uh Romans chapter I'm just uh putting this uh late but I will read it to you Romans 9 11 verse uh chapter 9: 11 to uh 14 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of of God according to the election might stand not of works but of him that call it it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I Lov they were never born yet but God said Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there's unrighteousness with God God forid for he said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion thank you Lord It's he that loves you brother before the foundation of the world Amen it's a little bit out of the topic but I want to express the word from my heart you know the prophet said when he started building the Masterpiece he said he started the foundation of Faith so there are four Heroes here that the prophet took and he said Abraham was the foundation of this statue then Isaac was the foundation the second Foundation is love now the second was Jacob it was Grace the third was Lo perfect in the eyes of the Lord but still Satan admired him it was Joseph perfection Faith love Grace and Perfection but all the prophets that he created Satan admir them I was searching one of the the almost perfect was the king Hezekiah when Isaiah was C he came to him and Isaiah told him I God is done with you you will die and Hezekiah he turned on the wall and pray he said I walk with you perfectly extend my life and I search King Hezekiah he was so in love with God and he apply the word of the Lord to his kingdom but there's only one flaw you know what is it he invited the king of Babylon and he showed The Treasure of his kingdom and Isaiah came to him and said one day the Babylonian will take all your treasure because you showed it to the unbelievers that's why if you have planned just keep it in your mind yes sir amen amen all the prophets had flaws all that once was a a portion but there is a last coming up through that finally comes the Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected to the building himself his own image was reflected in his work God and Christ were one in so much until he put this is what you were talking brother Ron he put his own Spirit unto him and then even the image and the Builder become one Hallelujah God and his sculture work his masterpiece this is my favorite one 79 The Perfect Image the God man in in morphe had changed from Supernatural to the vision and the vision was was uh projected into the image and the image was smitten so so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death from Supernatural to the vision from the vision projected an image now could taste the Deb God's perfect Masterpiece amen but this perfect masterp Masterpiece he was the fullness of the godhead badle he could not only project Moses he could project his entire being into the person of this person and taste death for the whole human race God's perfect Masterpiece God so inspired by seeing seeing it he became the Redeemer of all ages to speak for those in the backgrounds who had been before and now there's so many images of God in the Old Testament when when God spoke to job he was in the form of Whirlwind when God spoke to Abraham brother Mario he was in the form of MDC no father no no mother no brothers or no sisters he was the king of Jerusalem he was the theophany of God but he was not perfect image when God spoke to Moses and Moses long to God I want to see you and then Moses said I will not show my face to you but I will pass by and God saw the back part of God amen amen it was the theophany of God but it was not the Perfect Image what is the difference of MDC and Jesus Christ Jesus Christ had father and mother MDC doesn't have father and mother what is the purpose of Jesus Christ to face death so that he can redeem us God wants the Masterpiece amen the kinsman redeemer Hallelujah that's why he became a perfect image praise the Lord that's that's uh that's deep to me brother Colossians 2:9 he was the fullness amen of the godhead bodily amen Jesus Christ every knee will bow every tongue will confess in the name of Jesus Heaven and Earth there's no power in the name of Jesus I brought this this one you know what is this Brother David in the old American days there was a Chinese Laundry you know that right so the Chinese Laundry the Chinese you bring the clothes use clothes to them that no right thing only uh uh part of the paper so bring it to me back I'll give you your clean clothes got you got you okay this is your matching piece you keep that once you redeem it I want to match it if it's right so all he was the matching piece from the Old Testament all the prophets he was the matching peace he was match uh uh the Moses you know all the promises was met in him he was the perfect of the Perfection all type was fulfilled in him our Kinsman redeeming rer wrot and boas our lawgiver from Mount Si our Prophet from the Wilderness as as he come from the mountain as he come from the Wilderness as he come from eternity and become man The Perfect Image amen amen God down Through the Ages heing Away by the Patriarchs and made his platform and brought them up from the different things that he would lay his foundation upon the begin to build his word the prophets and then finally come out the perfect Prophet perfect Foundation perfect vision God had he's all the promises all the proph the prophecies everything that God had made promis he was all in all he was the one that was prophecy that he will bruise the head of the serpent amen he was the one in Daniel chapter 2 that the rock that was seed out from the mountain that destroyed the Seven Kingdoms he was the one he was the one that Moses was projected him that Moses was was a uh uh like uh Pharaoh wants to destroy all the children he was a type of Joseph when Joseph was sold of 30 pieces of silver and he found a wife a gentile wife asenat Hallelujah and then he put he he he he put his beloved wife away from his brethren he raptured the wife firsten he was the type he was the matching piece thank you Lord amen amen amen his life match exactly the life of Moses the life of David when David was crying as a rejected King he projected that too amen am but The Perfect Image needs to be cut that's why in Mark chapter 97 we find the prophet said we find we find upon the mount Transfiguration when there stood Moses the law there stood Elijah the prophets all the way back from the Patriarchs the fathers the law the prophets and all of them standing there he we hear a voice coming from the cloud and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him amen hallelujah speak amen and they're going to hear he's got to speak it was just a few days before he was Mitten this is my son whom I please to dwell in I have molded him I've been 4,000 years beginning him to this and now he is so perfect got to Smite him so he can speak hear ye him Hallelujah he is the perfect one he is the Masterpiece on the day of Calvary he was smitten Bruce and and he was struck on the side and it gave birth to the bride of Christ Hallelujah and the bride was came out and the birth of the bride of Christ was in the day of Pentecost it's time to preach brother Joshua that's why the pro brother Ron said the bride tries to go back to Pentecost we're not going back we started from there amen how can you go back we're not going back to Pentecostalism we are going back to Eden Hallelujah the bride has a foundation too the prophet said she had a foundation notice here the life that was in the husk in the stock in the stassel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in stock went one with to make the other it started the foundation of justification Luther Luther was not the perfect one he was smoking he was preaching about the Jews crucified Jesus Christ sanctification justification made a way that's why I I I tried to stop Brother Juan said brother R Don't Preach my sermon he was preaching over there at the office justification we have the same thought brother Ron it's not our thought it's his thought tonight is the predestinated night to preach this word that's right thank you Lord the way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost Made A Way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again amen manifest itself it's not a different kind of bride it's his bride she is the perfect image of the bridegroom e was impregnated of Satan and she came out out from Eden back to the world go to the World cast out from Eden but Mary was impregnated by the Holy Ghost and brought life to the world oh and bring back to Eden now here's Jesus said man shall not leave my bread alone I am the Tree of Life the bride if Jesus Christ match all the the Patriarchs the prophets in the Old Testament here is Mary match also all the women in the Old Testament in the New Testament because she is the perfect one so now the bride match the life of Mary when the angel came unto her and said hail Thou Art Mighty favor or highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women there's so many God can choose but why God choose you why God has uh chosen us amen because he found the matching peace he found the matching peace in you am I correct can I check Hallelujah you will not going to get your new clothes brother it's match Hallelujah word everything that Mary in the New Testament was match to the bride of Christ when God said to when the angel of the Lord told to Mary and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall called his name Jesus and Mary no struggling brother Joshua she was an Amen Corner she said the handmaid of the Lord behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me tell me more about me according to your word amen the bride is matched amen praise the Lord she was matched in the life of Rebecca when elaser came to her and told her that she's the most beautiful woman in the world other than Maria and she will be the bridegroom she will be the husband of Isaac or she will be the wife of Isaac and she did not see she did not see Isaac but she was in love already because the way elizar telling her she was so in love already and she said I cannot wait and then Elisha said I will I will give you a little bit of Revelation brother or sister you are a blood relative of Isaac what do you mean you came from his mind Hallelujah you came from him and you're a part of him you are match Praise You Jesus and amen and other than that he's waiting right now in between of his land of his of his riches and Glory he's waiting right now and then the family was telling her are you going to go you never seen him maybe he doesn't have a teeth maybe he does doesn't have a hair I don't care I'm in love already amen I didn't see Jesus brother I don't want to see him with beard and long hair I want to see him as my bridegroom amen hallelujah you know the Catholic still looking for the long hair and the beard with the Middle Eastern clothes I'm looking because if I how do I know that that he's a handsome because I can see myself to him praise the Lord did you ever see the the cat facing the mirror and he did not see the little cat facing the mirror he saw a big lion brother a big lion that's how we see that's how we see ourselves we're not a little tiny little bride with a FIP fire we are a grownup bride ready to marriage supppper of the Lamb amen hallelujah or wedding supper of the Lamb he was matched to the life of Ruth when Ruth deciding Ruth serving root resting what is the other one brother Ruth resting rewarded you read the message brother I'll give you a penny later Ruth resting he was the the the the the kinsman redeemer the bride was matched to root amen everything that I can see to the women in the Scripture it match brother yes that's our life because we are the perfect image amen thank you Lord no this one is is I don't know maybe just me it's deep brother Esther 21517 this is Esther perfect match brother Joshua when the when the turn to es of Esther it's her turn to to enter into the king's chamber the daughter of Abel the uncle of Mori who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing no no no she required nothing but what ha guy but what brother Bram said the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that look upon her she is a virtuous woman she's different from the world so Esther was taken into the king as we Asus into his Royal on in that Revelation 10:7 Hallelujah in the 10th month which is the month of tiet in the seventh year amen of his Reign am perfect amen she entered into the king's Palace in the 10th month of the seventh year and when the bridegroom saw she was different and the bridegroom cannot wait and said speak you are The Perfect Bride speak all that I have is yours but I want you to speak that's why Revelation 10:7 when God opened this Revelation to us brothers and sister how can you not speak God gave us an opportunity be to be the voice amen am speak Revelation 108-111 speak prophesy I give you my word I give you my voice speak my brother as I was with Moses we are identified with the him or with them I was with Moses when he went down This Is Us brother do you think you're a a Creator although the prophet said before born again you are a creator of time that's right I thought I am an eternal you need to be born again first amen before born again you are a creation of time time but then when you accepted the Lord you became the creator of Eternity that's why it's it must it's not supposed to be or will but you must be born again amen amen Brothers if you're are not baptized you must be born again if you want to be a creature of Eternity you must be born again but here because we match all the the prophets and the women in the Bible that's why I can say greater than than than than Ruth is here greater than Esther is here because they projected the life of the Bride they're not perfect but the bride is perfect amen that's why I can say I was with Moses when all the people turned against him I was with Moses when he was when he crossed the Red Sea when he raised his hand and walked forward and the Red Sea opened I was identified in Christ right then I was with Moses at that hour whatever Christian has been whatever Believers has been every believer now is a identified with that same person amen whatever it is you must be identified don't forget that when you do you got to spiritual Amnesia you've forgotten who you are that's why the fivefold ministry has the ministry in the last days to tell you bring you little by little here you are you know when before you had an Amnesia you were perfect before you had an AM Amnesia you are beautiful fearfully wonderfully made in God's image but now when the preacher told you who you are it's time to Rejoice brother I was I was with Elijah in the days of of uh Ahab when they had to make a choice when they would serve God or bail we were was with him on Mount Carmel when he had to make this choice for we are identified in the body of the same God that he was identified in so it were identified in the body then we must remember we were there with him that night that right hallelujah amen now I was with David when he was rejected by his own brethren I was with David you were too if you were a Christian if you are a Christian you have to be identified in his rejection I was with Hebrew children in the fiery furnace when the fire could it burn because of the presence of the forthman I was with Daniel in the Lions then I was identified in there when the angel of the Lord identified him in there everything brother the prophets of all we are identified with them because as as Christ was the Perfect Image We Came From Him Praise the Lord there's no fault in him all perfect my the prophet said notice the bride if the bride in the beginning was the word or the bridegroom and then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also the bride must be why must the bridegroom to be the word manifested made plain because the bride and the bridegroom are one no one amen hallelujah now where are we she is just meeting piece of him there is the Masterpiece it was meeting say Michelangelo could not reprodu that again he could not pick it back but God is going to do it he is going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to his side of the original word and there he is there is the Masterpiece the family back in Garden of Eden praise the Lord what is the Garden of Eden I want to project your position in the Garden of Eden amen the original man is a spirit man when God needs to to do to Adam to domain the cattles and everything he created the human man now this is not the perfect one if you go home and somebody will overtake you and wants to to to road rage with you brother John and if your body will react your body is not perfect yet but but in the Garden of Eden Adam was the god of the earth yes in the Garden of Eden this is the position that we're going back in the in the Garden of Eden God Adam have a fellowship with God Amen in the Garden of Eden Adam can speak to the nature am he was the god of the earth now when you know the I was studying this for almost a year now I'm not finished yet the wave ship offering I I I'm almost there but this is one year of the making remember the first one to mature amen and that is the prophet of God in our last days he was the one that lead us to come out from the denominational ideas so here when the people saw him they misinterpreted of him as Christ right amen that's why people were baptizing in his name because he almost like Christ but cannot be because he's just ah the first one to mature amen praise the Lord now when the first when the prophet was not telling this to himself he's telling this to us that the third pool will be in Us in the time of squeeze speak why he's so perfect he looks like Jesus Christ he spoke to the storm and he had fellowship with God God said walk with me he spoke to the animals to the aosm to the fish to the squirrel and to the bull I I'm sorry I disturb you um I I will go pray for the sick and the Raging bu that the smoke coming out from his nose he became a tble because he recognized the servant of God hallelujah the power of God brother and then he can discern the thoughts of the hearts of the people like Jesus Christ but they did not know that he was just looks 17:30 Malachi chapter 4 the waving of the shei I was trying to pronounce this right that's one of my struggle that's why I cannot really finish it to preach the waving of the Shi I keep asking uh who's that uh the one that I uh um Siri or not Siri Alexa no no Alexa said Alexa how to pronounce Chief and sheep no shef so the first one that come to mature the first one that Prov it was a wheat that proved it was a shei the prophet said she if God if Jesus Christ was mitten she is meeting from the church the body is meeting her from the uh the same purpose she is the word just the same as Joseph was written from the Brethren or smitten from the Brethren because he was the word and Jesus was written or smitten from the Brethren because he was the word the church is smitten the bride is smitten from the church because she is the word there is your stages again because of the time I will skip not this one and as he his being the groom the bride was to come Fort cuz it's part of him it can only be manifestation of the fulfilling of all the relation relations any other that has spoke of the Bride amen it can only manifest it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride amen if I speak to you the word and I manifest different I am not a Christian right right we need to preach how did the prophet said you cannot preach higher than you live because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and a woman are one man and woman are one and the woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics we don't have only a a thunder brother what is the use of the thunder without the lightning come on we have a thunder and lightning mechanics and Dynamics the word that we preach there's power and life I'll close overtime 1 minute minutes when the bride looks into the word what what did she see she doesn't see herself she sees Christ Perfect Image how she look like let's us stand how she look like the prophet said first she's her step is step of the gospel and who she is she is the word amen she is the word they look like one out of every nation the Philippines Canada Africa you know why you you respond differently African brothers because of Joseph when he saw Jesus Christ carrying the cross and he fell because of the weight of the Cross what did Joseph do he stepped in and carried the cross of Jesus Christ that's why African Brothers don't hide your power amen show your power to the church amen she was the word the way she passed by instead of going down they started going up we're going up brother but as a minister of the Gospel all we can say is my friends just stay in line too soon God will come soon and soon and very soon

there's never been one that has preached that went before the beginning there was never a messenger from any age that said now I want to take you before the beginning before he was God takes you back into the mind of God and he said he had attributes you know all that he began now he began began to create because they were thoughts in his mind mind is the womb of the spirit and God was a spirit amen he began to create and when he spoke the word which is the logos of God that's the thinking the thought of God Christ was the logos thought of God you are a part of the very logos of God that's
