[9:42] and quit playing while I read this here
[9:44] um this uh was she called me today
[9:49] sister Josephine did this is her praise
[9:52] report she said due to multiple
[9:55] symptoms that I had I went to ultrasound
[9:59] for my thyroid 10 weeks ago and they
[10:02] found a bad
[10:04] nodule I was referred to an
[10:07] endocrinologist right away 7even days
[10:09] ago this doctor told me the nodule was
[10:12] bad and to be honest with um you look it
[10:17] looked like cancer thus the biopsy
[10:19] should be done as soon as
[10:21] possible sometimes it's just easy for us
[10:23] to say if it's not
[10:28] yours if if it's not yours but if it's
[10:31] knocking at your door it's a different
[10:33] story yeah listen
[10:38] when when it comes down to us yeah amen
[10:42] and to our wife or our children or our
[10:46] body our prayers get a little more
[10:48] serious don't they yes yeah God help us
[10:51] to the Bible says that when one member
[10:55] suffers the whole body suffers
[11:04] it's a different
[11:06] story only mind I told the doctor that
[11:11] God is in
[11:13] control watch the confession of faith my
[11:18] flesh was a little nervous for the fight
[11:20] is real capital letter is real but deep
[11:24] down in my soul I was excited of what
[11:27] God will do amen as the day approaching
[11:31] what can a Believer do other than
[11:33] believe I counted it as a blessing and
[11:37] an a good opportunity but I was talking
[11:41] to God as if he is just around and we
[11:46] never mention or give attention to what
[11:49] the doctor told us because I never
[11:52] believe his report from the first place
[11:54] though I can feel the
[11:56] symptoms brother Brenham tells us don't
[11:58] listen to the the symptoms amen he said
[12:01] go to the promise amen I did I searched
[12:06] and Googled it and boy I'll tell you
[12:08] what if you ever want
[12:10] to have your mind go to playing hey
[12:15] Google it huh search it out oh man every
[12:17] symptom I got oh oh yeah oh yeah see
[12:23] textbook uh I searched it Google it and
[12:26] above all but I said it's not for
[12:29] me we talk more of God's promises and
[12:32] the things he has done and the benefits
[12:34] of the believer that we have to enjoy
[12:37] yesterday I was listening to brother
[12:39] Brennan preaching about the six sense
[12:41] two times Faith cometh by hearing the
[12:44] revealed word and created more faith to
[12:47] me today was the day of my
[12:51] biopsy Before We Gather for prayer I've
[12:54] told Hannah to tell bethl to clean up
[12:56] the pantry after working because I
[12:59] cannot do do it due to biopsy that I
[13:02] need to rest but something telling me
[13:05] that I'll come back and do
[13:07] it amen Mario gathered bethl and Hannah
[13:11] and my mother to pray Mario said Lord we
[13:14] will go to the hospital just to confirm
[13:18] your never failing promises our Miracle
[13:21] working
[13:22] God Amen see she is healed because we
[13:26] believe amen few hours ago I was laying
[13:30] on the operating
[13:32] table this was today operating
[13:36] table with all the needles gauze syringe
[13:40] around me they prepped for the biopsy
[13:43] and to be honest my flesh was nervous
[13:45] because I don't like
[13:46] needles she and she's a
[13:50] nurse go figure I don't like them either
[13:54] the assistant doc told the final
[13:57] ultrasound to make sure that the nodule
[14:00] is there before the IR doctor will do
[14:03] the puncture she said it's there I said
[14:07] why I told
[14:10] you that things going to go away and
[14:13] they all laughing said
[14:15] maybe uh we're not trying maybe you're
[14:18] not trying hard enough but in my mind I
[14:21] didn't believe that then Dr Andrew came
[14:24] and turned my neck towards him place the
[14:27] towel ready to duby SE with guided
[14:31] ultrasound then he kept getting more
[14:34] pictures and more and
[14:35] more there's no need for me to do a
[14:45] biopsy because it's liquid and there's
[14:47] nothing in there I said my God is real
[14:51] and he is alive and a Healer Lord the
[14:54] assistant who said that I did not try
[14:57] harder said it's a miracle
[14:59] Miracle God thank you Lord I said there
[15:04] are people in the last days that will
[15:07] believe the miracle working God and his
[15:10] name is Jesus Christ I jumped off of
[15:12] that table I got dressed I was
[15:15] testifying to the people in the clinic
[15:18] as it went out into that
[15:20] building and this quote struck me during
[15:23] the preaching last Wednesday the law
[15:26] having a shadow this brother brandham in
[15:28] Chicago
[15:30] 56 I believe the time will soon arrive
[15:33] that when healing will be a miracle
[15:35] healing such as a common thing we've got
[15:39] to get some rapturing faith in the
[15:40] church to get away from here for one of
[15:43] these days brother Brenham can say that
[15:46] day is today and To God Be glory honor

[30:15] way there came forth a little children
[30:17] out of the city and mocked him and said
[30:20] unto him go up thou bald head go up thou
[30:24] bald head and he turned back and looked
[30:27] on them
[30:28] and cursed them in the name of the Lord
[30:31] and there came forth two she Bears out
[30:33] of the woods and tear and tear 40 and2
[30:36] children of them and he went from then
[30:39] to Mount Carmel and then he returned to
[30:43] Samaria may the Lord bless the reading
[30:46] of his word you may be
[30:48] seated
[30:50] uh we are still uh continuing with
[30:55] uh what we have started
[30:58] uh on uh seeing Jesus in this program
[31:02] and uh this will be I believe part five
[31:05] and Elijah's ministry will be on part
[31:09] two
[31:11] um
[31:13] we been covering such uh part of the
[31:18] word believing that uh there's no three
[31:22] four
[31:24] five program in this last day there's
[31:27] only one program program which is God's
[31:30] program and we believe that uh only a
[31:34] elect people are given this program in
[31:36] this hour because in the contest in the
[31:39] passing of 1962 to 63 he said Lord has
[31:44] uh we are passing and the whole thoughts
[31:47] of 62 are dying out and we getting into
[31:50] 63 uh may we become better servants may
[31:55] we see Jesus and his program show us the
[31:58] rock beneath the rock uh because uh in
[32:02] this hour we see all kind of agendas in
[32:05] the world uh and people we get swayed by
[32:09] all these kind of agendas as we have
[32:12] seen the prophet showing us the whole uh
[32:16] end time under those seven Visions we
[32:20] see that we have uh the world with the
[32:24] part of the ministry what they are
[32:26] fulfilling but by God's grace also God
[32:29] at some time also has a part of the
[32:33] Bride but then uh we understand that uh
[32:36] in the mystery of marriage uh it's not
[32:39] just about becoming a
[32:42] bride because uh getting married is uh a
[32:47] one- day
[32:50] event there can be a lot of preparation
[32:52] before that courtship and love story and
[32:56] uh doing some some investigation on the
[32:59] lady and on the brother could this be uh
[33:02] the right person you're going to pray
[33:04] and all that but then afterward then you
[33:07] come you make the vow you say well you
[33:11] are my head you lead me from this time
[33:15] on I am not under anybody else
[33:19] leadership and uh during
[33:23] courtship the lady sits under the men
[33:26] Ministry is receiving she's receiving
[33:30] she's saying amen and the more she gets
[33:34] closer the more she start speaking like
[33:38] him she start looking like him she
[33:41] dresses the way he likes
[33:44] it that's why brother Bram say don't be
[33:48] unequally yolked because uh Ahab went
[33:52] down there and uh followed the painting
[33:55] and the makeups and and all the tight
[33:58] skirts and the shorts and everything and
[34:01] the BPS and stuff but then before he
[34:04] knows it he find himself into
[34:07] trouble so it is also with Elisha as we
[34:11] saw it last time that
[34:13] Elisha set under the ministry of uh
[34:17] Elijah whereby he understood that under
[34:22] such a Ministry this is where she was
[34:24] going to become the last voice to the
[34:27] last
[34:29] age and uh in the message we are so much
[34:33] acquainted you are the bride believe it
[34:35] amen we are the bride such a good thing
[34:39] but then
[34:40] afterward all the marriage ceremony all
[34:43] the cloud appeared all the pictures
[34:46] taken now the voice says go take the
[34:49] book eat it and now go
[34:54] prophesize and now Elisha goes out to
[34:59] prophesy because Elijah was taken
[35:03] up 63 65 the man is out of the scene the
[35:09] officer United the church and the
[35:12] head such a great mystery of the seven
[35:15] seal in this
[35:16] hour
[35:19] whereby ministers feel so good when they
[35:22] preach about the seven
[35:24] seal but uh afterward
[35:28] there's a Ministry brother Bram will the
[35:31] bride have a Ministry yes she has a
[35:35] Ministry and now the application of the
[35:38] ministry because Jesus was born as a
[35:41] baby seed of God Son of God and Jesus
[35:46] grew in Statue before God and
[35:50] men and at the banks of the river Jesus
[35:55] received the Holy Ghost because the
[35:57] Cloud came down and the voice
[35:59] said to whom that you shall see the
[36:02] voice uh the the the uh the dove come
[36:07] down that's the one he said that Behold
[36:11] the
[36:11] Lamb he has a Ministry to do his
[36:15] ministry is to take away the sins of the
[36:19] world and right away after this he went
[36:23] into the Wilderness to pray 40 days and
[36:25] 40 night butam says he had to stay in
[36:28] such a fellowship with the
[36:30] father because right after mat 4 comes
[36:33] into view and he was tempted right away
[36:37] and the devil took him up and started
[36:40] showing him all kind of things the
[36:43] ministry was into action so it was also
[36:47] with Elijah so it was with William
[36:50] brunham when the angel of the Lord
[36:52] visited him he went and Roy David said
[36:56] you know no those things was talking
[36:58] about like you know those are you
[37:00] probably had a bad Supper The
[37:03] Temptations was right out of the gate so
[37:06] was Elisha Elisha we understand that he
[37:10] sat under such a Ministry wonderful
[37:12] Ministry of the hour because Elisha is
[37:16] uh the
[37:17] bride not only the bride because after
[37:21] marriage you move from being the bride
[37:24] to a spouse to a wife
[37:29] and now under such a condition now comes
[37:32] a
[37:33] responsibility a responsibility to do
[37:35] the
[37:36] work and the work is not something to uh
[37:39] to brag about to go on the street to say
[37:42] well you know I the Bride of the end
[37:45] time because at that time we find
[37:49] ourself oh everybody is gone yeah Jesus
[37:54] was at the the the bank of the river
[37:57] everybody was looking who's that man
[38:00] what is he doing what's happening what
[38:03] is all this light coming about then
[38:06] afterward she goes home then she find
[38:09] herself she has to do the
[38:12] dishes she has to start sweeping every
[38:15] day she has to start cooking every
[38:19] day how does she cook how does she
[38:22] handle the stress of the children
[38:25] brother bam says you have to understand
[38:27] it's a
[38:29] responsibility because when those
[38:31] children come under that Ministry they
[38:35] going to start
[38:36] now uh messing with the walls and
[38:39] jumping on the chairs and everything
[38:43] right then it's no more about going on
[38:47] the street I am the bride I am the bride
[38:49] I am married I am
[38:51] married now she knows how am I going to
[38:54] deal with this
[38:58] this child doesn't
[38:59] listen my husband doesn't listen to me
[39:03] my wife doesn't listen my church doesn't
[39:08] listen it is a
[39:11] responsibility one thing it is to say
[39:14] like you know oh look at the day look at
[39:16] our picture 1963 turning to the right
[39:20] and it is another now to eat the book
[39:23] and prophesize to many people
[39:28] and here is
[39:31] Elisha after succeeding
[39:36] to Elijah he found himself like you know
[39:39] man of God the land is good but the
[39:43] water
[39:44] here is not good at all can you come and
[39:47] help us can you come and preach to us oh
[39:51] brother we love your
[39:52] sermon oh we love the your ministry oh
[39:56] God has sent you all over the world we
[39:58] we're streaming you oh you're such a
[40:01] wonderful sister oh your life is a
[40:04] testimony to
[40:05] us after such a miracle in his life then
[40:09] come the
[40:12] test and and he went up from Dan unto
[40:17] Bethel and as he was going up by the way
[40:21] they came forth little children out of
[40:23] the city and mocked him
[40:29] under such a great
[40:32] anointing under such a great
[40:37] Vindication after such
[40:39] testimonies of what God is doing in his
[40:44] ministry after living such a good life
[40:48] as a
[40:49] virgin getting into marriage as
[40:53] such now comes the struggle right
[40:57] because when he was giving me the
[41:00] Elijah's Ministry part two it's like I
[41:02] got into a store room with
[41:06] many many layers or many
[41:12] gifts I saw the part of looking at it
[41:15] from the children perspective why they
[41:17] had to behave that
[41:19] way I saw it from this perspective but
[41:23] he told me no take this one
[41:26] here I said well we'll take that but I
[41:30] believe by God's grace as sons of God in
[41:33] the message we know that why the
[41:36] children had to behave the way they
[41:40] behave and he found himself there
[41:44] challenged by the little children they
[41:47] said well bhead grow up too oh we saw
[41:52] you know the Miracles in brother brother
[41:54] Ministry oh we saw your husband was this
[41:57] and all this here but then what about
[41:59] you you too old so go up but then the
[42:02] men lost temper really
[42:06] quickly the men lost
[42:09] control when the minister start touching
[42:12] certain places yeah then we we are not
[42:16] comfortable
[42:17] anymore when the husband say like you
[42:20] don't know you have to listen to
[42:22] me that the word said that your place is
[42:24] here don't you can't tell me anything
[42:28] you can't tell me what to
[42:29] do but you were just under such great
[42:33] anointing you have such a great
[42:35] testimony people on the outside they
[42:38] know you bride of
[42:39] Christ they know you believe of the
[42:43] message but then now in the secret place
[42:47] when nobody knows what's going on then
[42:50] the challenge comes into play just as
[42:54] brother Steven said it on Sunday it's
[42:56] like you know character is shaped when
[42:58] you are alone right and here now he find
[43:02] himself all alone with the little
[43:07] children but what I'm saying innocent
[43:12] children the challenge is coming and
[43:15] standing up is said like you know we
[43:18] have a
[43:19] Ministry I am a deacon in the church I
[43:23] have this title in the
[43:25] church but then before issues before
[43:28] problems before this Temptations quickly
[43:32] we lose our
[43:36] positions the angel of the Lord the
[43:38] Angel and the commission you remember
[43:41] Elisha young fellow went baldheaded was
[43:44] young when he was young man some little
[43:47] children begin to holler said old bold
[43:50] old old bald head where didn't you go up
[43:53] with
[43:55] Elijah sometimes people know where to
[43:57] put to pin yeah where like you know to
[44:00] step on your toes yeah you know you come
[44:03] to church everything is cozy but then by
[44:06] the time you get in the car did you hear
[44:09] that the pastor preached you
[44:12] today I just came from church can you
[44:16] just give me the time
[44:18] to meditate on the
[44:21] word then he find
[44:23] himself already now challenged by
[44:27] Powers innocent
[44:31] people sometimes the pastor is innocent
[44:34] doesn't know what's going on in what's
[44:36] whose life what is who is doing what and
[44:39] things but then it comes to start
[44:41] touching
[44:42] places then we get mad with the innocent
[44:48] pastor we get mad with
[44:50] him you can preach on that oh I spoke
[44:55] with brother such because brother SE is
[44:58] on on the council board that means like
[45:01] he's the one who surely told the
[45:07] pastor you can see the Mind Barrow right
[45:10] right amen you can see what's going on
[45:12] in people's mind despite of the word
[45:16] restore in people's
[45:19] life despite being given a Shalom that
[45:22] you are the
[45:24] bride despite giving all the guarantee
[45:28] that you have not done it to begin
[45:30] with but then on the field the person
[45:35] find himself losing the
[45:37] battle we find ourself losing the ground
[45:42] knowing how to work when all these
[45:44] situations face
[45:46] us because when we are called to be the
[45:49] bride is not to keep the title bride but
[45:53] called to become wife right because Ruth
[45:58] was not given the six measure of B for
[46:01] her to remain just Ruth after the
[46:04] Reapers but was to go into the house and
[46:07] give forth
[46:10] children but here
[46:12] now Elisha with his
[46:16] ministry with the innocent people that
[46:19] he is supposed to deal with is start
[46:21] cursing them he start destroying the
[46:24] very element the very very prophecy that
[46:28] was given to him to
[46:32] fulfill this is the same way that we saw
[46:36] with Martin
[46:39] Luther he was supposed to understand
[46:41] these
[46:42] things but then the Lord is showing they
[46:45] say hey look he started kissing he
[46:47] started cursing the people he said like
[46:50] you know tush ran off the woods and
[46:51] killed the PE the children is that right
[46:54] that's not the nature of the Holy Spirit
[46:59] right that's not the nature of the holy
[47:02] spirit because the holy ghost in the
[47:05] soul right is the nature of the
[47:10] spirit but now when now we find such a
[47:14] condition in our lives you can talk to
[47:18] me I have more experience than
[47:21] you I've been preaching this message for
[47:24] so long you know brother Bram also
[47:28] says why because the places that the
[47:32] holy spirit is addressing in the
[47:36] church we holding on to it we like to
[47:40] stay there
[47:42] longer rather than moving and
[47:44] understanding that we are not in the
[47:47] position of the Bride anymore but we
[47:49] have to bring forth children and these
[47:52] children because Jesus after being there
[47:57] being anointed going into the Wilderness
[48:00] came and went into prayer prayed all
[48:03] night and came and started selecting the
[48:09] disciples because when William Brenham
[48:11] was given the commission was not for him
[48:14] to go sit down but was given to him to
[48:17] go and start going and finding the
[48:23] bride and Elisha also is also anointed
[48:27] in the same manner for him not to sit
[48:29] down you say like you know oh I I I can
[48:33] go out there and and preach the word and
[48:36] and serve the Lord in the in the
[48:38] capacity that he has given me you know I
[48:41] don't really like that sister I don't
[48:43] like that brother
[48:45] no because now this is
[48:50] adoption this is not Church
[48:52] attendance right we come to church and
[48:54] we listen to the word and we go out
[48:57] no but here now Elisha is in the
[49:00] position that I'm coming to church what
[49:03] is my position Lord that's what am I
[49:07] doing I am filled with the Holy Ghost I
[49:10] know all these quotations left and right
[49:13] what am I
[49:14] doing and now in the capacity of your
[49:18] adoption the challenge comes into to
[49:21] play he said what was that you know but
[49:25] that was a that was
[49:27] that but that Prophet was angry see you
[49:30] have to be careful what you
[49:34] do you think that there the nature of
[49:37] the Holy Spirit no sir but that Prophet
[49:40] was anger he had power to do that he
[49:44] could curse those children if he wanted
[49:46] to he could take the we could take it or
[49:49] leave it do you believe that and Jew
[49:51] with people who are gifted from God sure
[49:55] it is yeah the prophet is showing look
[49:59] at how these people in their condition
[50:02] look at the bride in their condition
[50:05] that she is endured with power from on
[50:08] high but this power in the wrong
[50:12] hands can cause a lot of Damages in the
[50:16] Kingdom amen no
[50:18] wonder Jesus gave the key to heaven to
[50:22] men not the key to hell because we've
[50:26] this hanger
[50:28] issues you play with me you go to hell
[50:32] you play with me you go to
[50:34] hell but then when now with all this
[50:38] anger issues it's hard for us to send
[50:41] anybody in
[50:43] heaven it's hard on human being to do so
[50:47] right you look at the children like I
[50:50] don't want to see you
[50:52] alive and not saying I hope you burn in
[50:55] hell that's human
[50:58] nature that's not the nature of the Holy
[51:01] Spirit but yet this is the person ured
[51:04] with power from on ey that's why Paul
[51:07] said I have to Die
[51:09] daily I have to watch the places that
[51:12] I'm walking into because at this level
[51:15] of responsibility given unto me is not a
[51:19] place to come and destroy guys children
[51:21] that's right that's why the prophet said
[51:23] we shall be surprised of how many people
[51:27] we shall see over there why are we
[51:28] surprised because of our
[51:31] nature the way another sister she won't
[51:33] make it they know another brother he
[51:36] won't make it why human
[51:39] nature despite of all everything that we
[51:42] we were we were given hey you are the
[51:47] bride you have eaten the
[51:49] book take the book and eat the book
[51:52] become the book prophesize to many
[51:55] nations bring them in instead of
[51:58] bringing them in what do we do we cast
[52:00] them
[52:01] out cut the fellowship
[52:04] brother what kind of
[52:07] ministry Elisha what kind of
[52:11] ministry but then when we understand our
[52:15] position then now our mind is
[52:18] focused in strengthening those who are
[52:22] weak that's right then the mistakes of
[52:26] our brothers and sisters become an
[52:28] opportunity to work yes because we have
[52:32] to labor on the wall from the rising of
[52:36] the sun until the stars
[52:39] appear but then as human beings we don't
[52:42] like
[52:43] that you believe it or you reject it
[52:47] make your
[52:49] choice that's human
[52:52] nature it's like you know we are ured
[52:55] with power from another
[52:59] but then the Bible says Philippian
[53:02] Philippians 4 4:10 but I rejoice in the
[53:05] Lord greatly that now at the last at the
[53:09] last your care of me have flourished
[53:12] again wherein ye are ye were also
[53:16] careful but ye lacked
[53:18] opportunity not that I speak in respect
[53:21] of one for I have learned in whatsoever
[53:26] state I am right there with to be
[53:31] content
[53:33] Amen elasia in such a
[53:36] condition because when the Temptation
[53:39] come in sh or form father mother
[53:43] preacher whatever you we
[53:46] are we have to learn to be in a
[53:50] position to be
[53:52] content with whatsoever faces us yeah
[53:56] amen because when we see communism among
[53:59] us some of us we start not crying and
[54:02] say like you know oh we need to cut them
[54:04] off and or we claiming we start blaming
[54:07] others and or we start finding all kind
[54:10] of excuses and things but he said no I
[54:14] learn in whatever
[54:17] condition either I am received either I
[54:21] am
[54:23] rejected in whatsoever condition that
[54:26] I'm in
[54:27] I learn to be content right not because
[54:31] that if I do that now people will
[54:34] respect me no it's because I understand
[54:37] my position I understand the
[54:41] responsibility that I am
[54:43] carrying because the thing Jesus in his
[54:46] program is not just like you know seven
[54:48] sales this you know the son of men that
[54:51] left and right then when we come it it
[54:54] applies to our lives we loseing
[54:57] we cutting corners and we cheating left
[54:59] and right and we talking all kind of
[55:03] nonsense behind the back and all these
[55:05] things come
[55:07] on because it is a
[55:10] responsibility what you saying behind
[55:14] there killing people whatam says it's
[55:18] not just like you know stabbing somebody
[55:21] but killing the
[55:24] influence it is a responsibility
[55:27] yeah because that is adoption yeah if
[55:31] it's just a child that is growing we
[55:33] understand oh that's a teenager you
[55:35] understand teenagers how they
[55:37] behave but then when you are mature
[55:41] right when you are
[55:43] adopted when you are married you're not
[55:47] a walkie talkie my husband this my
[55:49] husband that is here because the third
[55:52] pool is a secret speech
[55:56] unknown and unheard of men only those
[56:00] who go inside are able to understand the
[56:04] language and when they go inside is not
[56:06] to become out
[56:09] baren
[56:11] right you can get in and come out Barren
[56:15] and when you come out you have to be
[56:18] pregnant and don't give us don't give us
[56:21] a still born
[56:23] Ministry because the ministry to grow
[56:27] because the word was in
[56:29] Mary and fruitful coming out and now
[56:33] Jesus when they see the ministry say
[56:36] bless
[56:40] areou because
[56:42] adoption it's not about putting it in
[56:46] 1963 adoption is understanding who I am
[56:51] my position what am I doing and what are
[56:54] the challenges I'm facing in my
[56:57] Ministry and how do I deal with that
[57:01] Ministry because we find ourselves
[57:03] quickly we losing Sympathy for the
[57:06] people we become so hard but what I'm
[57:09] saying it's because of lack of water
[57:11] planting the vine where to plant it you
[57:14] planting the in the wilderness that leaf
[57:18] will Spin and will roll down and become
[57:21] his
[57:22] thing but then you put it in a very
[57:25] fruitful ground
[57:27] with enough water then you have enough
[57:30] Shadow to bring people under your
[57:32] fellowship
[57:35] right because adoption is not about
[57:39] brother I'm Sav I'm Sav brother I'm sa
[57:42] my husband said my brother said but then
[57:44] take what your husband said and put into
[57:47] application yes yeah that's dress the
[57:50] way your husband wants you to dress
[57:52] right MH walk the way that the word
[57:55] wants you to walk
[57:56] right yes appear the way the word wants
[57:59] you to appear
[58:01] right and if it doesn't make sense go to
[58:04] your maker yes what have you called me
[58:08] for I've called you to dress this
[58:10] way but God's grace will see that into
[58:14] the Tabernacle how the Lord came down
[58:16] with his vision said I need the clothing
[58:19] of the Tabernacle to stand this way and
[58:23] I have called people of such tribe Tri
[58:27] people of such Ministry people of such
[58:30] capacity for them to be able to fulfill
[58:34] this work of the
[58:35] ministry but here now it says I know
[58:40] both how to abase I know how to abound
[58:44] everywhere
[58:45] everywhere everywhere and all in all
[58:48] things I am
[58:50] instructed both to be full and to be
[58:54] hungry both to bound and to suffer need
[58:58] I can do all things through Christ which
[59:02] strengthens
[59:04] me because the bride is facing this
[59:08] challenge he saying brother Bram he's
[59:10] showing us that Elijah in this Elisha in
[59:13] this condition he find himself looking
[59:16] into the Unseen looking at the children
[59:19] looking at the condition say like you
[59:21] know what am I going to
[59:24] do how am I going to deal with this Pam
[59:28] says it's because I did lost the feeling
[59:31] for the
[59:33] People by the minute that we start
[59:36] losing the love for the word because the
[59:40] bride is the
[59:41] word then we start destroying the word
[59:44] right I don't like that sister I don't
[59:46] like that church that Pastor didn't
[59:48] preach it correctly I am the one who
[59:51] have the Revelation who are you fighting
[59:53] against the bride
[59:57] who are we going against the church
[1:00:01] which church because Revelation says
[1:00:04] come out of her my people and now we are
[1:00:07] called to minister to the
[1:00:10] bride and as we are ministering to the
[1:00:13] bride how are we dealing with the
[1:00:15] challenges that we are facing Moses lost
[1:00:18] the feeling of his people because they
[1:00:20] wouldn't listen to him and that's how
[1:00:22] the church
[1:00:24] is that's how that's those are the
[1:00:27] challenges that God has chosen to put in
[1:00:29] our
[1:00:30] pathway through adoption because if we
[1:00:34] don't face those challenges then we are
[1:00:36] just walking with the
[1:00:40] devil if I amam says if I go longer
[1:00:43] without any Temptation in my life I have
[1:00:46] to ask the Lord what's going
[1:00:49] on and the church doesn't like it I come
[1:00:52] to the Lord everything has to be
[1:00:54] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:00:57] amen but it is not
[1:00:59] so because it started with
[1:01:02] Jesus after praying he was tempted he
[1:01:06] started with William Bram with Moses the
[1:01:09] same he came to the people he thought
[1:01:12] the people would understand
[1:01:15] sure what are we facing in our lives for
[1:01:19] us who are
[1:01:20] adopted yeah not just preaching the word
[1:01:23] not just saying that you know the
[1:01:25] message the revelation of the hour what
[1:01:27] are we facing and how are we dealing
[1:01:29] with
[1:01:31] it are we like David we go and we say
[1:01:35] like you know I'm the king and nobody
[1:01:37] will tell me anything you go you Tex
[1:01:38] somebody's wife and when they come they
[1:01:40] reproach
[1:01:41] you then you start passing up it's say
[1:01:44] you know we have to apply the fullness
[1:01:46] of the
[1:01:48] word and then when they tell you that's
[1:01:51] you it's you the Deacon of the house
[1:01:56] it's you in your
[1:01:58] house it's you in
[1:02:00] yourself it's your life of prayer that
[1:02:03] you've
[1:02:04] neglected you've set time into so many
[1:02:06] other things amen because after this
[1:02:11] remember you know the Bible that after
[1:02:13] this Elisha has so many more things to
[1:02:16] do yes amen we have the
[1:02:20] record that when we see William Bram
[1:02:23] after departing from the from the
[1:02:25] Baptist he has a whole long journey to
[1:02:27] go it's not a smooth ride
[1:02:31] amen it is a bumpy
[1:02:34] one and thank God for the bumps on the
[1:02:38] road sometimes it is a trap setting
[1:02:42] there you walk your path as a young lady
[1:02:45] as a young man as a minister whatsoever
[1:02:48] you are in all our positions we find
[1:02:51] ourselves facing the same issues yes
[1:02:55] each one of us oh I have to be submit H
[1:02:59] submissive to this man all the rest of
[1:03:02] my life what have I
[1:03:07] done why should I listen to him
[1:03:10] according to the IQ I have more High
[1:03:13] higher IQ than
[1:03:15] him but you chose him right you went to
[1:03:21] prayer now you wake up now you find him
[1:03:24] that he doesn't like to shower in the
[1:03:28] morning I'm not saying this for jokes
[1:03:31] I'm saying this to realize the
[1:03:34] responsibility that he is setting before
[1:03:40] us I thought you were brother I thought
[1:03:42] you were spiritual I thought you were
[1:03:44] this all over the message we see how men
[1:03:48] and women and people into all kind of
[1:03:51] chaos brother BR my my wife doesn't
[1:03:54] listen to me he I you need to cast down
[1:03:57] the demon it's like you just don't know
[1:03:58] how to
[1:04:00] work many of us don't know how to
[1:04:04] work we put the church into so much
[1:04:07] tension into the the children like you
[1:04:10] know Deering dad that is like you know a
[1:04:13] lion in the
[1:04:16] house but then when we start seeing the
[1:04:20] revelation of who we
[1:04:21] are that as the Martin Luther King of my
[1:04:25] house
[1:04:26] with such an anointing upon me the
[1:04:29] anointing brings a
[1:04:32] Shalom it doesn't bring fear he said be
[1:04:35] not afraid it is
[1:04:37] Daddy be not afraid it is
[1:04:41] Mommy with a such a loving
[1:04:45] atmosphere when the ministers coming
[1:04:48] with in a fellowship with the brothers
[1:04:50] and sisters such a anointing with the
[1:04:54] Holy Ghost comes down the word start
[1:04:56] pouring forth but it's like this brother
[1:04:58] is here again brother says there are
[1:05:00] people they live a good life but you
[1:05:04] just can't stand the
[1:05:07] atmosphere you just can't be around them
[1:05:10] yeah it's not that they are bad people
[1:05:12] it's just the atmosphere that we are
[1:05:16] producing we want to show off that we
[1:05:18] are the most spiritual one we want to
[1:05:21] show off like you know we are the one
[1:05:23] that that the Lord has given all the
[1:05:26] Revelation but it's saying like you know
[1:05:28] it's
[1:05:30] because we have lost the love for the
[1:05:32] people and now I cannot go with a
[1:05:35] Ministry like that brother bam is saying
[1:05:37] until I feel different in my heart about
[1:05:41] it no matter if God did tell me but that
[1:05:45] is but that uh but that is that change
[1:05:48] that brother Roy that see coming
[1:05:51] something got to change me because in my
[1:05:55] heart heart if I go out there feeling
[1:05:58] the way I do now I still feel that the
[1:06:01] way I to have heard the message they had
[1:06:04] to have done it and I and I don't have
[1:06:08] the feeling for the people that I should
[1:06:10] have until I can get that feeling there
[1:06:13] is no need for me going because I'd be
[1:06:16] an
[1:06:18] hypocrite this is the prophet of the
[1:06:21] hour this is not you know the average
[1:06:24] believer in the church he found himself
[1:06:26] in that position Moses found himself in
[1:06:29] that position Elisha finds himself in
[1:06:31] that position right and the times we
[1:06:34] find ourself in that
[1:06:37] position we lose the love for the people
[1:06:41] we lose the love of being in such a
[1:06:44] fellowship like this now our love if we
[1:06:47] don't have the love for the church our
[1:06:50] love will be turned somewhere
[1:06:52] else we'll be turning it to pornography
[1:06:56] to Lasting to money to popularity to all
[1:07:01] kind of things and the prophet is
[1:07:03] showing us now how to deal with it he
[1:07:05] said no no no no no something must
[1:07:08] change me amen something must happen in
[1:07:12] here because God's program must go
[1:07:15] on because we are called onto such a
[1:07:18] great
[1:07:19] call because we understand my
[1:07:22] position there's no time to waste yes
[1:07:26] because this is 63 2 years the man is
[1:07:28] gone right how much time do we have
[1:07:35] left some of us 30 years we are
[1:07:41] living you get married
[1:07:43] young you give birth to
[1:07:46] Children before you know it they packing
[1:07:49] you quick and you
[1:07:52] gone we may say like you know well my
[1:07:55] Ministry oh I'm still young I'm still
[1:07:58] strong I'm still old this year but the
[1:08:00] appointed time on Earth is so
[1:08:04] limited and the work must be done quick
[1:08:08] and effectively and when we are doing it
[1:08:11] effectively now we need to be aware of
[1:08:13] these
[1:08:14] things how am I dealing how how am I
[1:08:17] dealing with my wife children my church
[1:08:21] my tithes my offerings and all these
[1:08:23] things right because all these elements
[1:08:27] God has given us such
[1:08:29] call he said that you're stealing from
[1:08:32] me imagine marrying a wife who steals
[1:08:35] from
[1:08:36] you you pull your bank account and the
[1:08:39] money is
[1:08:40] gone what happened you know I went
[1:08:43] shopping
[1:08:45] really you don't know the
[1:08:48] program you don't look you don't look at
[1:08:50] the
[1:08:52] budget it is the same program but I'm
[1:08:55] breaking it down to some level for some
[1:08:59] others because if she's unable to
[1:09:04] hold all her desires and all these
[1:09:07] things into position bringing it into
[1:09:11] subjection as the Paul is saying that
[1:09:13] you know I know both how to be to be
[1:09:17] abased and I know how to
[1:09:19] abound right if we don't know how to
[1:09:22] abound in all these places we last full
[1:09:25] I need this buy this and buy that buy
[1:09:28] product byy
[1:09:31] product then the whole program of God is
[1:09:35] coming crumbling
[1:09:38] down as I was telling a brother say
[1:09:40] brother look at how God the place the
[1:09:44] way God has blessed you is for you to be
[1:09:47] available when he needs you say I never
[1:09:50] thought of it like I say
[1:09:52] yes let's understand our lives the
[1:09:55] position God puts us into it's not just
[1:09:58] for church attendance my business and
[1:10:00] all this
[1:10:01] no God gives us all these blessings and
[1:10:05] position and beauty and Capa abilities
[1:10:08] and knowledge and understanding of all
[1:10:11] these things for a specific purpose
[1:10:15] yes and now in this time when we find
[1:10:18] ourselves say hey we have lost the
[1:10:20] feeling for the people and all these
[1:10:22] Year all these years I've tried to serve
[1:10:25] him that to serve him and with with a TR
[1:10:29] and I won't go out I I want go out there
[1:10:33] being being an hypocrite I got to feel
[1:10:36] that that isn't Ricky and Retta that
[1:10:39] isn't this church it's God's children
[1:10:43] that's in bondage that I must go
[1:10:47] to innocent
[1:10:50] children that Elisha is dealing with
[1:10:53] they said like go
[1:10:56] so these people in these
[1:10:59] conditions skirt here issue hair there's
[1:11:03] issue Nails it's an issue here stubbl
[1:11:08] there disease on the other
[1:11:10] side now I need to understand how to
[1:11:13] work with these
[1:11:15] people but then for me to be able to
[1:11:18] help them something must happen
[1:11:23] inside I can't just be an anointed
[1:11:27] person with quotations and label of the
[1:11:32] message but this is
[1:11:34] a adopted son who goes out and start now
[1:11:39] what should I
[1:11:41] do for this children who are in
[1:11:45] bondage because remember Genesis 14 when
[1:11:49] he heard that his BR his uh nephew was
[1:11:53] in in bondage it took all the man who
[1:11:56] grew up in his house it took all the
[1:12:00] love it took all the helmet he took all
[1:12:04] the breastplate he took the sword it
[1:12:06] said like you know hey I have to go
[1:12:08] after
[1:12:09] him or I can be contempt and saying like
[1:12:12] you know oh one one Abraham equals 100
[1:12:17] Lots I am good I'm not in Sodom
[1:12:21] really is that your position but no not
[1:12:24] Abraham
[1:12:25] the Seed of Abraham understand the work
[1:12:28] seeing Jesus and his program it's not
[1:12:30] about you know brother Bram here brother
[1:12:33] Bram did this year revelation of the son
[1:12:35] of man where is he revealed
[1:12:37] that in
[1:12:41] 63 because he's here 63 showing us that
[1:12:45] I must go after these
[1:12:48] people the people are in
[1:12:51] bondage yes there must be an internal
[1:12:54] evangelism
[1:12:56] in areas that people need to be
[1:12:59] strengthened
[1:13:01] upon in areas that we are becoming aware
[1:13:07] of the issues among
[1:13:10] us
[1:13:12] because the Lord wants his Tabernacle to
[1:13:16] be built in a certain
[1:13:18] fashion in a certain
[1:13:21] manner because Alpha must come to Omega
[1:13:26] amen we understand that in between the
[1:13:29] Holy Ghost was bound yes but then in
[1:13:32] this hour when the Holy Ghost is set
[1:13:35] loose what do we
[1:13:36] do sit down and criticize
[1:13:40] us we becoming
[1:13:43] aware who are we what are we doing yes
[1:13:48] what are we supposed to do and how we
[1:13:51] supposed to do it and if we are called
[1:13:53] to be adopted Sons and Daughters then
[1:13:57] our position we must reflect it in our
[1:13:59] lives first leave me that sermon before
[1:14:03] you preach it to me what kind of
[1:14:05] atmosphere do you have when you bring to
[1:14:08] church I pray that by you oh Vivid are
[1:14:12] you ready to come to church because I am
[1:14:15] happy when they say unto me let's go
[1:14:17] into the house of the Lord
[1:14:20] amen I will not stay home when I know
[1:14:24] that the door of the church is open am
[1:14:27] right I have to be there I have to bring
[1:14:29] my share yes right unless if you in a
[1:14:33] mission the Lord has send you like
[1:14:36] Phillip you know leave the congregation
[1:14:38] here go there there's somebody there
[1:14:40] down the road you need to help right
[1:14:43] adopted
[1:14:45] Sons not Church
[1:14:47] attendance church attendance is
[1:14:50] numbers but says then you become like we
[1:14:53] become like uh uh luk one Believers says
[1:14:57] they are worse than
[1:15:00] unbelievers
[1:15:02] right I'll just go to church I'll just
[1:15:05] listen I'll just stand here no we need
[1:15:07] to be
[1:15:09] present
[1:15:11] active doing exactly what God has called
[1:15:14] us to do am that's right amen because
[1:15:16] the anointing is not about speaking
[1:15:19] about it yesterday the day I got married
[1:15:21] oh my wedding was this I was telling my
[1:15:24] sister say how many people remembers
[1:15:26] your
[1:15:29] wedding how much of that feeling of the
[1:15:32] wedding is happening
[1:15:36] now but then look at the experience that
[1:15:39] you're getting with raising the
[1:15:41] children preparing the sermon being into
[1:15:45] prayer pulling from the
[1:15:47] minister Lord address this part here of
[1:15:50] my life so I can be able to still keep
[1:15:53] working
[1:15:55] otherwise we are a bunch of communist in
[1:15:57] the
[1:16:00] church calling ourselves Martin Luther
[1:16:03] King you know leaders and I have a dream
[1:16:06] dream have a
[1:16:08] vision have the
[1:16:10] program work according to the
[1:16:15] program Luke 22 it said and the Lord
[1:16:19] said Simon Simon behold Satan have
[1:16:22] desired to uh to have you that he may
[1:16:25] see you as we because in this position
[1:16:28] that's what the devil does in the work
[1:16:30] of our ministry that's what the devil is
[1:16:33] doing right he wants to destroy us so
[1:16:37] quick because he knows what kind of
[1:16:40] power we are anointed
[1:16:43] with because when he said that it is not
[1:16:46] the disciples that did the work but it
[1:16:48] was I in the disciples it is the same
[1:16:52] way is the same yesterday today and
[1:16:55] forever and if it's to them the same
[1:16:57] yesterday today and forever the devil
[1:16:59] knows that I can let these people do the
[1:17:02] work let me bring division among them
[1:17:06] let me bring classes among
[1:17:08] them remember with Jesus when we spoke
[1:17:11] about Luke 22 it said like you know he
[1:17:13] that wants to be the greater do what
[1:17:15] serve
[1:17:17] others but then when we lose the feeling
[1:17:20] then the work of the ministry we just
[1:17:22] talking now I am bright I am bright I am
[1:17:24] bright I am bright as we see on the
[1:17:26] social media you know a very big diamond
[1:17:29] and stuff but she doesn't know how to
[1:17:33] cook she doesn't know how to
[1:17:36] clean she has long
[1:17:38] nails like Nebuchadnezzar crazy she can
[1:17:42] sit
[1:17:44] still this is the condition that Leia
[1:17:48] put us into but the Lord said I also
[1:17:51] have witnesses and here are the
[1:17:53] witnesses amen he is the bride that when
[1:17:57] Queen Esther she's not coming there like
[1:17:59] you know like V beauty beauty beauty
[1:18:02] there from morning to morning selfie
[1:18:04] here Instagram right uh Snapchat left
[1:18:08] all these things here no she said like
[1:18:10] you no no no no no no I understand mod
[1:18:13] say like you know hey understand that
[1:18:15] you are brought in this time for a
[1:18:18] purpose come on because there's there's
[1:18:21] an agenda coming out for destruction of
[1:18:23] the old church
[1:18:25] it said like you know you are married
[1:18:27] brought into the palace for a specific
[1:18:31] purpose don't go out there and following
[1:18:33] dress this and you know beautiful this
[1:18:36] yes like no no no no no this is how you
[1:18:38] access to the king you need to get to
[1:18:40] the king
[1:18:43] quickly because n man wants a skilled
[1:18:48] all Let It Be Democrats Let It Be
[1:18:51] Republican Let It Be communism let it be
[1:18:54] whatever that
[1:18:56] is because the seven Vision shows this
[1:18:58] whole land into ashes
[1:19:02] amen yes that's right and he's making a
[1:19:05] way he said that he said that you know
[1:19:08] I'm making a way the Escape through
[1:19:11] Rapture but then for those people to
[1:19:13] come out I'm giving you the
[1:19:15] responsibility to go do that
[1:19:18] work and when we become
[1:19:21] conscious of this type of work none of
[1:19:24] us in the church church will just come
[1:19:26] to church and walk out out of after
[1:19:29] service each one of us have a position
[1:19:32] to
[1:19:33] fill prayer warriors cleaners sound
[1:19:37] Engineers videos and everybody
[1:19:40] interpreters everybody in the post of
[1:19:44] Duties in season out of season always
[1:19:49] ready because this is seeing Jesus I'm
[1:19:54] not saying church members I'm not
[1:19:56] looking at people just sitting in the
[1:19:58] pews right I'm seeing Jesus am and his
[1:20:03] program Elisha's
[1:20:05] Ministry being fulfilled in this hour
[1:20:09] because afterward we see elishah
[1:20:11] bringing forth the child back to
[1:20:14] life we see Elijah removing the poison
[1:20:17] out of the food rightly dividing the
[1:20:20] word amen I see Elijah sitting under
[1:20:23] Elisha's Ministry
[1:20:25] understanding how to get to get access
[1:20:27] in of the
[1:20:30] word we preach on these
[1:20:33] things access to the word Elisha's
[1:20:36] ministry under under under uh uh under
[1:20:42] Elisha this great
[1:20:45] vision because we are so much acquainted
[1:20:48] in the message seven SE then we say like
[1:20:51] yes that's really the word brother you
[1:20:53] preach the son of man today but this is
[1:20:56] the son of man in
[1:21:00] Simplicity this is the son of man
[1:21:02] reconciling those loose
[1:21:05] hands placing those
[1:21:08] places bringing the picture of the
[1:21:11] puzzle
[1:21:12] together that if I'm putting if my
[1:21:15] picture in my mind is come to church
[1:21:18] listen to the word and then go back home
[1:21:20] and all these things you no that's like
[1:21:23] painting the picture and you have a a uh
[1:21:27] a cow eating on on the
[1:21:29] tree you can't be there just like you
[1:21:32] know God no God saw me just sitting on
[1:21:34] the pews no that's nonsense nowhere in
[1:21:36] the
[1:21:38] scripture nowhere in the scriptures you
[1:21:40] can marry a wife and all she does she's
[1:21:43] just sitting
[1:21:45] there come on you can't give me
[1:21:47] children you can't cook me some
[1:21:51] food you can't sit under Elisha's
[1:21:53] Ministry and said make B me the the cake
[1:21:56] first right you only have your own
[1:21:59] priorities work and my my project and
[1:22:03] after after church I'm gone I don't
[1:22:05] shake nobody's hands I don't fellowship
[1:22:07] with nobody and all this year what are
[1:22:10] you afraid
[1:22:13] of I'm talking the
[1:22:16] word I'm showing Elisha working in his
[1:22:21] ministry right because if I'm coming
[1:22:24] coming like like Peter and John and say
[1:22:27] like you know hey brother what's your
[1:22:28] need I am
[1:22:32] healed I'm suffering let me pray for you
[1:22:35] brother let me pray for you sister enact
[1:22:39] your
[1:22:40] Ministries put it to Value right go
[1:22:44] visit somebody go talk to people you
[1:22:47] never spoke to before right instead of
[1:22:49] just going in your little click
[1:22:52] somewhere open up a bit and see how
[1:22:57] Joseph Ministry starts springing from
[1:23:00] going over the
[1:23:02] walls not just the limit that you're
[1:23:04] giving yourself very
[1:23:07] good either you are well spoken bad
[1:23:10] spoken halfway spoken get into the
[1:23:14] word because the prophet was found
[1:23:17] himself in the same position he said
[1:23:18] like you know hey you know I I don't
[1:23:21] speak very good English he said like you
[1:23:22] know people don't need that
[1:23:25] people just need you to speak and the
[1:23:28] Holy Spirit Come and transfer the word
[1:23:30] amen he said like really yeah that's how
[1:23:33] it
[1:23:34] is the work of the
[1:23:39] ministry adoption it's not just
[1:23:43] saying keep saying what you want on
[1:23:46] seven sell this seven sell that but then
[1:23:49] when the Lord is looking at you so I
[1:23:51] married you just to say seven seven SE
[1:23:53] seven s not doing anything
[1:23:58] right because he wants to see the
[1:24:02] linage because he shall see his
[1:24:05] pedigree and he wants to see the
[1:24:08] pedigree coming
[1:24:09] forth because his wife has to be a
[1:24:12] fruitful Vine around his
[1:24:15] table he must have children sitting at
[1:24:18] his
[1:24:19] table he is a young man with the quiver
[1:24:23] with full of
[1:24:25] arrows he wants to send us into
[1:24:29] places he wants to have ministers he
[1:24:32] wants to say have
[1:24:33] singers right amen but then when we just
[1:24:37] want to find ourself in a cozy
[1:24:39] environment you know I never been in
[1:24:41] such a place you know I'm afraid I'll
[1:24:43] just stay in the church and you know I
[1:24:45] won't do this here I won't visit anybody
[1:24:48] because I I don't want any problems this
[1:24:51] is part of the believer right am
[1:24:55] it is given to us in that
[1:25:01] position 2 Corinthians 4:7 verse 8 we
[1:25:05] are troubled on every side yet not yet
[1:25:08] no uh yet not distressed we are
[1:25:10] perplexed but not in despair persecuted
[1:25:13] but not forsaken cast down but not
[1:25:16] destroyed always bearing about in the
[1:25:19] body the dying of our Lord Jesus we
[1:25:23] under we have the understanding that the
[1:25:26] blood cell that was broken up has sent
[1:25:30] out
[1:25:31] aive yeah and in the midst of all the
[1:25:34] Despair and all the challenges and
[1:25:36] everything that we go through the
[1:25:38] ministry must go
[1:25:40] on the work must go on we must do it
[1:25:44] always bearing in the in about the dying
[1:25:47] of our of the of the in the body of the
[1:25:50] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[1:25:53] the life also of Jesus might be made
[1:25:57] manifest in the prophet's body no in our
[1:26:02] body
[1:26:04] amen because Jesus said the Bible said
[1:26:08] the prophet says Jesus didn't finish
[1:26:10] everything that's
[1:26:14] right he says he left the part of the
[1:26:19] suffering a portion for
[1:26:21] you a portion for me
[1:26:24] that's why at the cross said he didn't
[1:26:26] say all is finished he says it is
[1:26:31] finished is portion of the work was
[1:26:35] finished and we Doo have a
[1:26:39] portion and each one of us that's right
[1:26:43] we can fulfill our portion of the
[1:26:46] scripture if we have not set under
[1:26:51] Elijah that's why I read it last sermon
[1:26:54] that that to become the last voice to
[1:26:57] the last age we must say under the
[1:27:00] prophet of the a am you can't dep we
[1:27:05] depart from the prophet what are we
[1:27:07] going to
[1:27:08] fulfill our own ideas yeah because the
[1:27:12] program was given to Elijah he say
[1:27:15] Elijah go anoint Elisha a prophet in thy
[1:27:22] stad we anointed to take the what the
[1:27:27] prophet has left us for us to
[1:27:31] fulfill another message no fulfilling
[1:27:35] the message applying the
[1:27:39] message is life was a wave sheave unto
[1:27:42] us an example how to receive the Holy
[1:27:45] Ghost how to deal with these things here
[1:27:47] to close up yeah he found himself in the
[1:27:50] church he's preaching and the two young
[1:27:54] people they
[1:27:56] start going and playing in the church
[1:27:58] say like you know hey stop
[1:28:00] that no they can't listen stop that they
[1:28:04] can't listen stop that they can't listen
[1:28:06] they voice say say what you will
[1:28:09] amen that opportunity given to some of
[1:28:14] us we can turn them into servants you
[1:28:17] know it's like to show I am the man of
[1:28:21] God let the fire come down and consume
[1:28:25] both of
[1:28:26] you but then the holy ghost ahead of
[1:28:29] time is say like you know hey watch a
[1:28:31] trap is on your
[1:28:33] way God is putting these children of God
[1:28:37] in conditions and
[1:28:39] places in which it pushes us to our
[1:28:43] end I've told you my son I've told you
[1:28:47] my daughter we don't dress this way we
[1:28:49] don't walk this way we don't talk this
[1:28:52] way and this is how you recompense me
[1:28:54] all the work that I've done all the
[1:28:58] sermons that's human
[1:29:00] nature but then when we become
[1:29:03] acquainted we we are aware of our
[1:29:06] ministry it's said like no no it's not
[1:29:09] about title you know preacher Deacon and
[1:29:12] all these things here but when I'm say
[1:29:14] Hey you are just like me if you were
[1:29:17] converted 5 minutes ago God is looking
[1:29:20] us at the same
[1:29:22] pedestal of course some some of us are
[1:29:24] called Elders because of the journey
[1:29:27] their journey in the world but then
[1:29:30] before God you are all
[1:29:32] Sons right different
[1:29:36] positions but then when the prophet
[1:29:38] wanted to go out then calling them Rick
[1:29:41] and
[1:29:44] stop if he did that with him what shall
[1:29:48] he do with us the same
[1:29:51] thing and then when we are aware
[1:29:54] then we have to go above Beyond ourself
[1:29:58] get over our own ideas and be able to
[1:30:01] embrace God's program and said like you
[1:30:03] know Lord give me the
[1:30:07] opportunity give me the opportunity to
[1:30:10] see the one who hurts me the most is the
[1:30:14] one that I'll stay in prayer for right
[1:30:18] the one who doesn't show up to church is
[1:30:20] the one that will become my friend
[1:30:24] why because I have a life that I can
[1:30:27] transmit to
[1:30:29] him because Jesus walked and the limb
[1:30:34] walked Peter and John came to the door
[1:30:37] and excuse me find one who was a
[1:30:42] for 38 years right and the anointing
[1:30:45] upon them he said like you know gold and
[1:30:48] money and and anything we have none but
[1:30:52] such as we have we give it to you the
[1:30:54] man didn't go home he went to church yes
[1:30:58] amen apply this in all those
[1:31:03] areas he didn't go outside the Bible
[1:31:06] said he went into the temple rejoicing
[1:31:10] God Amen the child who doesn't listen
[1:31:13] the wife who doesn't listen the husband
[1:31:15] who doesn't want to come to church after
[1:31:18] your anointing is poured upon them then
[1:31:21] we are brought into the word
[1:31:24] that's
[1:31:26] right adoption elious Ministry is not
[1:31:30] something about church
[1:31:33] attendance we'll preach about the son of
[1:31:35] man we'll preach about the Revelation
[1:31:37] we'll preach about the ministry but at
[1:31:40] the end of the day the Lord said what
[1:31:42] did you
[1:31:44] do with the talent that I give to you oh
[1:31:47] Lord you know I'm I'm I'm uh I don't
[1:31:51] like to take I'm I don't like to take
[1:31:54] risk you know I went and hide myself
[1:31:57] under the blanket like you know I know
[1:31:59] nothing and I don't need any problem he
[1:32:02] said like you know take that away from
[1:32:04] him even what he doesn't have and give
[1:32:06] to others right and he's calling us all
[1:32:11] right each one of us to labor if this
[1:32:15] can make sense in our mind can be this
[1:32:18] clear in our mind that means that the
[1:32:21] Lord has a work for us to do right in
[1:32:24] whatever position but it has to be
[1:32:26] according to God's program right
[1:32:28] otherwise we going about like you know
[1:32:31] oh you know I'll go and you know start
[1:32:34] to become such a person and stuff not
[1:32:37] lawful to be said here on the
[1:32:39] pulpit I hope you understand the
[1:32:42] language these
[1:32:44] places that the Lord is calling us
[1:32:48] onto is it benefiting your program or
[1:32:52] God's program very
[1:32:56] because many times like you know I feel
[1:32:58] I like to do this I feel like musician
[1:33:00] if you can can come I feel like I I want
[1:33:03] to do this you know my life and you know
[1:33:05] my choice and all these things here your
[1:33:07] life your choice right you think so
[1:33:11] right very good are you the
[1:33:14] bride or are you a free
[1:33:17] woman are you under
[1:33:20] leadership under that leadership you do
[1:33:23] things you
[1:33:24] want you do what he
[1:33:27] says because one of his wishes is what
[1:33:31] our
[1:33:33] Command is our Command it may seem to be
[1:33:37] hard King you want us to go get the
[1:33:40] water of of
[1:33:42] Bethlehem don't you see the Philistines
[1:33:44] don't you see this don't you see
[1:33:47] that Moses Go free my people I can speak
[1:33:51] you
[1:33:52] know right all kind of
[1:33:55] excuses but he said
[1:33:57] no when I send I don't send you alone
[1:34:01] amen Lord I Am With You Yes amen even in
[1:34:05] you yes all the way in that day this day
[1:34:10] you shall
[1:34:12] know that I am in the Father the father
[1:34:16] in me the son do with nothing except he
[1:34:19] sin what done by the father according to
[1:34:23] what vision
[1:34:25] we're running around and not fulfilling
[1:34:27] God's
[1:34:30] purpose because we think that you know
[1:34:33] it's better for us to go make that much
[1:34:37] money or do you think you can make it
[1:34:40] better than Elon
[1:34:45] Musk don't you think that God has
[1:34:47] limited your
[1:34:49] life to a certain
[1:34:52] area a certain income a certain
[1:34:57] ability for a certain purpose right
[1:35:01] amen it's not by chance that's right I
[1:35:05] know at times we look at ourselves we
[1:35:08] say like you know why can't I just be
[1:35:09] like everybody
[1:35:11] else why can't I just like you know go
[1:35:14] and dress and speak with anybody have
[1:35:17] boyfriend and
[1:35:19] girlfriend but he said defile not your
[1:35:22] body right MH because when you
[1:35:25] grow I have a work for you to do yes
[1:35:29] that's the program MH and when we come
[1:35:32] to the program let's remember let's not
[1:35:35] lose the love for these people
[1:35:39] amen because this is the people that
[1:35:42] you're avoiding here on Earth that you
[1:35:45] have to spend eternity
[1:35:47] with that's right and if we can spend 2
[1:35:51] three hours in Fellowship how we going
[1:35:53] to spend eternity good
[1:35:57] right that already tells I I mean I have
[1:36:00] to be honest with myself if I find
[1:36:02] myself in that position you know I'm
[1:36:05] avoiding the brothers I'm avoiding the
[1:36:08] sisters that means that you know my
[1:36:10] fellowship is somewhere
[1:36:12] else because the Sheep always stay
[1:36:16] together in the same F in the same uh uh
[1:36:19] uh Folk
[1:36:24] andam says in the time of heat the
[1:36:27] shadow of one covers the other yes in
[1:36:31] the time of Co of cold the warmth of the
[1:36:34] other uh hits the
[1:36:37] other we are called to stand as
[1:36:40] one one body One
[1:36:46] Faith God's problem is not an
[1:36:49] intellectual thing right it is a
[1:36:52] lifestyle reality yes it is a way of
[1:36:55] living yes it's not just walkie talkie
[1:36:59] walkie
[1:37:00] talkie it is a
[1:37:03] fulfillment of the
[1:37:05] prophecy amen because when Mary went to
[1:37:11] Elizabeth she didn't go there with a
[1:37:13] dead son in his own bosom in her own
[1:37:16] bosom but she went with life he said how
[1:37:20] come the man of my Lord that when you
[1:37:23] just spoke then the sun came to
[1:37:28] life what is our ministry fulfilling
[1:37:35] yeah then we have not to take it we have
[1:37:38] not to check ourselves right and said
[1:37:41] what do I have what am I giving right
[1:37:45] criticism when I'm with the brothers did
[1:37:48] you see the way she she dressed
[1:37:50] today that's nonsense
[1:37:53] raise the standard
[1:37:55] higher work in the ministry in those
[1:37:58] places and the Lord wants to see the
[1:38:01] bride serving him in his Temple and this
[1:38:05] is the temple yes may the Lord bless you
[1:38:08] amen
[1:38:13] amen amen let's stand
[1:38:18] together you know I've always wanted to
[1:38:21] preach on second Kings chapter 2
[1:38:24] on Old bald
[1:38:27] head not
[1:38:32] because but you begin to look at this
[1:38:34] now Bible examples are given to you for
[1:38:38] real
[1:38:40] life
[1:38:42] examples now here is
[1:38:44] Elisha who has gotten the mantle of
[1:38:48] Elijah who has got a double portion
[1:38:51] right and there are times times in your
[1:38:54] life when the anointing has left you and
[1:38:56] somebody criticizes you and brother
[1:38:59] Brenham said it was not the holy spirit
[1:39:03] in Elisha to curse those children and
[1:39:06] took 42 of their
[1:39:11] lives he said that was an angry Propet
[1:39:14] right any of you ever had the anointing
[1:39:17] of God on you and and then a day or two
[1:39:20] later it's not there huh and you run
[1:39:25] from
[1:39:31] Jezebel brother renom said those
[1:39:34] immature children where did they learn
[1:39:36] their
[1:39:37] disrespect from the parents around the
[1:39:43] table Lord help
[1:39:46] us the Bible
[1:39:48] says the tongue is an unruly member who
[1:39:51] can yes that's true God help us to
[1:39:55] Bridle our
[1:39:57] tongue quit criticizing others yes
[1:40:00] because they'll come a time Hey listen
[1:40:02] the devil don't come around you when
[1:40:04] you're anointed he knows you cut his
[1:40:06] head
[1:40:07] off but when you're yeah you're just

[1:40:37] position where he he was out of sorts
[1:40:40] how about
[1:40:42] elishah or Elijah when uh you know one
[1:40:46] of the Kings said hey I I'd like a word

[1:41:19] message brother Bram said in all of the
[1:41:22] great anointing
[1:41:24] of the ministry of Elijah how many
[1:41:27] miracles did he
[1:41:31] do four in all the years of his ministry
