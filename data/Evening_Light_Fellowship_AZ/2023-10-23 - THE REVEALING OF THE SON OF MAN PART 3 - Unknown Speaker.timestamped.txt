[33:55] us amen
[33:58] Lord we thank you for thy presence
[34:00] that's here this morning Hallelujah
[34:04] Hallelujah Jesus yesterday I was
[34:06] meditating and um there was a thought
[34:08] that kept coming to mind this is where
[34:10] the songs are coming from it's uh it was
[34:13] the power of praise when um in the 2
[34:17] Chronicles 20 when Jehosaphat was king
[34:21] of
[34:22] Judah and the children of Moab were
[34:24] coming down against them to fight they
[34:27] sought the Lord and were praying and
[34:30] then there was a prophecy that came
[34:31] forth and said you're not going to need
[34:33] to fight just stand there watch the
[34:35] glory of God but shortly afterwards they
[34:38] go out to face the enemy and they're
[34:41] standing in
[34:42] Array and they sent the Levites out to
[34:45] sing praise as soon as they started to
[34:49] sing the Lord confused the enemy and
[34:52] they started to fight each other and
[34:54] just slayed each other and it's funny
[34:57] after it's like that's about verse 22 if
[35:00] you keep reading it says they were 3
[35:02] days in the spoil of the enemy 3 days
[35:08] the Lord wiped them out completely and
[35:10] then gave them extra on top of that
[35:13] that's the power of praise you look at
[35:16] Paul and Silas that's the power of
[35:19] praise
[35:22] hallelujah amen I feel like praising
[35:26] praising
[35:28] him oh I feel like praising praising
[35:34] him oh I feel like praising praising
[35:41] him oh praise him in the
[35:45] morning praise him all day long I feel
[35:50] like praising praising
[35:53] him me sing I feel like praising

[57:56] Hallelujah some of us yeah our bodies
[57:59] have broken down a little you know it
[58:01] ain't the model it's the
[58:03] mileage and some of the mileage you know
[58:05] we've just wore these things out enough
[58:09] and uh you remember as a young man you
[58:11] just run and you play and you you know
[58:14] you can hurt and yourself fall down and
[58:17] you know stuff well as you get older
[58:20] it's a little different
[58:22] story um and you know I remember brother
[58:26] Ed Dalton Papa Ed we called him we sang
[58:29] that song you can run through a troop
[58:31] and leap over a wall he said you know
[58:33] brother Ron I've been there he says but
[58:36] in my
[58:38] age he says I go around the troop and I
[58:42] look for a a gate in a wall you know
[58:45] amen so that's how it is with some of us
[58:48] even David when he went out and was
[58:50] fighting with one of the the sons of
[58:53] Goliath there
[58:55] and he was going to get killed and one
[58:57] of his men come and saved David and
[59:00] everything and uh you know David said
[59:03] well I'm as good as I was when I was
[59:05] young well in your mind amen you know in
[59:10] your mind age is
[59:12] just uh in your
[59:14] mind until you get older and then you
[59:17] realize that your body just doesn't
[59:21] react my wife's father he was very fit
[59:25] man a a German wellb built he'd worked
[59:28] hard his whole life and one day he came
[59:30] and his he he wore shorts you know and
[59:33] he was a contractor well anyway he come
[59:37] and his leg was all bruised up and
[59:38] bloody and and you know I think he had a
[59:41] scab on his forehead and everything and
[59:43] I said what happened he said well I come
[59:46] up to the job site little kindy little
[59:49] tiny ditch he says I I I come up to the
[59:52] edge of it and he said well you know I'm
[59:55] just gonna jump and he says so I said
[59:58] jump and my body said no and he said I
[1:00:01] landed down there he said halfway across
[1:00:03] he realized his body said
[1:00:06] no so there are times when your body
[1:00:09] tells you no amen even though you feel
[1:00:12] like doing it but one of these days
[1:00:13] saints of God and I believe it's very
[1:00:15] soon we're going to have in a moment in
[1:00:17] the twinkling of an eye there's going to
[1:00:19] be a
[1:00:20] change Hallelujah I'm looking forward to
[1:00:23] that one I tell you am Luke
[1:00:26] 17: 29 and
[1:00:31] 30 but in the day that lot went out of
[1:00:34] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:00:38] heaven and destroyed them all so when
[1:00:41] God delivers one he judges another
[1:00:45] amen even thus shall it be in the day
[1:00:48] when the son of man is
[1:00:51] revealed Matthew
[1:00:53] 18:1
[1:00:55] the Bible says for the son of man has
[1:00:57] come to
[1:00:58] save that which was lost so here's the
[1:01:02] mission of the son of man I come to save
[1:01:04] that which was lost Luke 19: 9 and
[1:01:09] 10 and Jesus said unto him this day
[1:01:13] speaking about
[1:01:15] zakus this day is salvation come to this
[1:01:19] house for so much as he also is a son of
[1:01:23] Abraham
[1:01:25] for the son of man is come to seek and
[1:01:28] to save that which was lost thank you
[1:01:31] Lord may God add the bless blessing to
[1:01:33] the reading of his word you all may be
[1:01:35] seated this morning in the presence of
[1:01:37] God I am titling this this morning the
[1:01:42] revealing of the son of man part
[1:01:44] three uh and we'll do a little bit of uh
[1:01:49] Meandering around a little bit this
[1:01:51] morning I trust that uh you will kind of
[1:01:54] follow me uh because I've had so much
[1:01:57] actually this morning when I got done
[1:01:59] typing my notes I had 22 Pages 22 Pages
[1:02:03] it just keeps coming coming coming you
[1:02:05] type you you do all of this and I'm I I
[1:02:08] really go crazy with cut and paste and
[1:02:11] uh but I don't want to be labor a point
[1:02:14] I don't want to um reiterate myself too
[1:02:18] much and so therefore when I bring these
[1:02:20] quotes up before you what I'd like to do
[1:02:22] is have you to read and read and and
[1:02:24] those uh my tech team is going to have
[1:02:26] to follow with me because I want to go a
[1:02:29] little bit quickly I am not going to try
[1:02:32] to attempt to go over uh 22 pages I cut

[1:02:40] 18 and uh so You' be praying for me but
[1:02:43] I want all of you to understand that
[1:02:45] there is something happening right now
[1:02:48] globally amen it is not only happening
[1:02:50] globally but it's happening personally
[1:02:53] it is happening into each of God's elect
[1:02:56] bride the Bible says to those whose
[1:02:59] names are written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:03:01] Life they shall not be deceived
[1:03:04] Hallelujah so you know that you that are
[1:03:07] the elect seed brother brandom talks
[1:03:09] about that Royal Seed of Abraham he
[1:03:12] talks about it he says now when they
[1:03:14] catch the word he said it is not them
[1:03:17] that's catching it it's not by intellect
[1:03:20] it's not because they prayed so much
[1:03:22] it's not because of the things that they
[1:03:24] did but the mere fact that they are
[1:03:27] elect seed and because they are elect
[1:03:30] seed they have an
[1:03:32] ability there is a
[1:03:35] receiver Jesus said he that hath an ear
[1:03:39] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[1:03:42] to the
[1:03:43] church so all of us I want to claim each
[1:03:48] and every one of you that are here today
[1:03:51] that you too will claim the fact I am an
[1:03:54] elect seed of God therefore whatever God
[1:03:57] says in this hour I will hear whatever I
[1:04:00] hear I will practice and whatever I
[1:04:03] practice will become a manifestation
[1:04:06] than you Lord we've seen I uh just in

[1:11:16] Gallant Soldier one who the angel of the
[1:11:20] Lord had chose him and said told his
[1:11:23] father said when Billy gets converted
[1:11:25] and he gets older he'll work with you
[1:11:28] there was no other man in our generation
[1:11:32] that had seen more signs had been with
[1:11:35] him in the meetings giving out the
[1:11:38] prayer cards driving his daddy to the
[1:11:40] meetings taking him from the meetings
[1:11:43] knowing when his father had too much
[1:11:46] he'd been under the anointing too long

[1:11:50] Billy how did you know when he'd been
[1:11:52] under the anointing too long I could see
[1:11:55] Daddy he started to stagger like a drunk
[1:11:57] man and said he'd look around and he
[1:12:00] doesn't know where he's at he'd wipe his
[1:12:03] face are you are you the Usher sir yes
[1:12:06] cuz he always had him come from the
[1:12:08] right because the angel was standing to
[1:12:11] his right and he says and when the
[1:12:13] people you've seen it in the movies when
[1:12:15] they they come into the presence of that
[1:12:17] angel they're a little bit shocked he
[1:12:19] said don't let that stop you don't be
[1:12:22] afraid that's him that's his
[1:12:25] presence and so you would see and he
[1:12:28] says we had a thing that when I felt
[1:12:30] Daddy was having too much I would come
[1:12:32] up there and he said I had a cue to put
[1:12:35] my hand on his right side and he says if
[1:12:38] Daddy was W couldn't go any further he
[1:12:42] would just fall back into my arms I
[1:12:44] would reach around and grab his Bible
[1:12:46] you see it in the movie reach around
[1:12:49] grab his Bible and look to the man like
[1:12:51] okay I'm taking him away

[1:12:58] let him know go let me go on my brother
[1:13:02] my sister this messenger that we have
[1:13:05] had in this our day I do not need to to

[1:13:12] to defend it it defends itself amen God
[1:13:17] watch over his word his messenger and
[1:13:20] this message we don't need to explain it
[1:13:23] I don't need to try to to make something
[1:13:26] fit I just say what he
[1:13:29] says our brother Billy Paul recently
[1:13:33] passing away and I've had different ones
[1:13:35] call and ask me and ones say uh well
[1:13:40] what about that cuz brother brandham had
[1:13:42] told him that before you're an old man
[1:13:46] he passed away at 88 years old
[1:13:50] 88 said before you're an old man sharks
[1:13:53] will be be
[1:13:54] swimming here in this area and so I want
[1:13:59] you to understand I am not here to try
[1:14:02] to
[1:14:03] explain to try to
[1:14:05] interpret but to just say what he said
[1:14:08] if you if you research this out and you
[1:14:12] type in the word shark or sharks he only
[1:14:14] mentions Sharks two times in all his
[1:14:18] message he never says this on
[1:14:22] tape he said say what I say on tape now
[1:14:27] I was with Billy I traveled with him I
[1:14:30] asked him and because I'm from Los
[1:14:32] Angeles how many of you know I'm from
[1:14:34] Los Angeles I'm one of those Ricky those
[1:14:37] long-haired dope smoking serent hippie
[1:14:41] that brother Brenham called Ricky and in
[1:14:44] fact God stood up for me one day and
[1:14:46] told his Prophet don't you call him
[1:14:49] Ricky and ricettas cuz I got some seed
[1:14:52] out there hallah Hallelujah I was a
[1:14:54] Ricky until I got converted I was one of
[1:14:57] those little City Slickers I wasn't no
[1:14:59] country boy no I don't claim to be I was
[1:15:02] born in Los Angeles Pasadena
[1:15:06] California my it's a good place to be
[1:15:10] from amen I just say that am now let me
[1:15:17] tell you we have witnessed within our
[1:15:20] lifetime I'm talking about me we've
[1:15:23] witnessed certain stirrings among the
[1:15:25] message Believers right one that all of
[1:15:29] you will know is
[1:15:31] 1977 brother Brenham said that I predict
[1:15:34] as a private student of the word of God
[1:15:37] that I believe it will
[1:15:40] 1977 will terminate the world system and
[1:15:44] Usher in Millennium how many know he
[1:15:46] said that so there was a lot of
[1:15:49] speculation because he said it and we
[1:15:52] thought oh my 1977 it's going to be over
[1:15:55] some people went ahead and you know
[1:15:57] bought houses and trucks and different
[1:15:59] things because you know what uh 1978
[1:16:02] we're going to be out of here so let's
[1:16:05] let's just go get something and drive
[1:16:06] something nice for a few
[1:16:09] weeks
[1:16:11] now he said I predict I do not
[1:16:15] prophesy he said I might miss it 5 years
[1:16:18] 10 years or whatever now my brother my
[1:16:21] sister that's why we do not not
[1:16:23] interpret what he said God is his own
[1:16:27] interpreter he brings his word to pass
[1:16:30] how he wants to now I want to show you a
[1:16:33] couple things and the reason I take
[1:16:35] certain things about California Los
[1:16:38] Angeles very serious is because I was
[1:16:41] there in fact brother Mike Patterson
[1:16:43] raise your hand over here brother Mike
[1:16:45] was at the meeting when brother Brenham
[1:16:48] preached choosing a bride he was there
[1:16:52] he witnessed it he was in California he
[1:16:55] had businesses his father was one part
[1:16:57] of the Full Gospel businessman that
[1:16:59] brought brother Brenham to Los
[1:17:02] Angeles the reason we moved out of
[1:17:06] California was because of the
[1:17:09] prophecy amen now let me show you a few
[1:17:12] things if you don't mind I'm going to
[1:17:14] Rabbit Trail just a little bit but stay
[1:17:16] with me I want you to see some things
[1:17:18] because I don't want you to
[1:17:20] misinterpret in 19
[1:17:24] 65 brother Brenham says in this day the
[1:17:27] scripture is fulfilled how could people
[1:17:30] ever fail to see who he was how did they
[1:17:34] ever miss it how could it be when it was
[1:17:36] so plainly made known and shed how could
[1:17:40] they ever missed
[1:17:43] seeing what a word think of it this day
[1:17:46] is the scripture fulfilled before your
[1:17:48] eyes who said it God himself who is The
[1:17:51] Interpreter of his own word this day is
[1:17:54] this scripture fulfilled the Messiah
[1:17:56] himself standing in the presence of the
[1:17:58] congregation and reading a word out of
[1:18:00] the Bible pertaining to himself and then
[1:18:03] saying this day today this scripture is
[1:18:05] fulfilled and they failed to see it what
[1:18:08] a tragedy it would be but it happened
[1:18:11] and it happened many times how could it
[1:18:13] happen of course like it did in other
[1:18:17] times by believing man's interpretation
[1:18:20] of the word that caused it those
[1:18:23] Believers in them days so-called
[1:18:25] Believers was taking the interpretation
[1:18:28] of what the priest had said about the
[1:18:31] scriptures brother Braham said don't
[1:18:33] take some man's interpretation don't
[1:18:36] take their opinion take and say what I
[1:18:38] say on the tape why because I'm ordained
[1:18:41] of God to say these
[1:18:44] things so when I talk about Los Angeles
[1:18:48] and the prophecy of Los Angeles Don
[1:18:50] Saunders you're one of them also too
[1:18:52] that come Mount of
[1:18:53] California here's the prediction about
[1:18:57] Los Angeles now I'm going to give you a
[1:18:58] prediction in 1964 December
[1:19:02] 1227 watch this who do you say this is
[1:19:06] here in Phoenix Arizona the world's just
[1:19:09] about to fall apart as I preached once
[1:19:12] somewhere about a Christmas message the
[1:19:14] world falling apart in fact brother
[1:19:16] Brenham preaches that four times but the
[1:19:19] first time he preaches the world falling
[1:19:21] apart is the the week after the opening
[1:19:24] of the seventh seal so follow it
[1:19:28] chronologically and the world again is
[1:19:31] just about to come to Pieces look at the
[1:19:33] earthquakes over here in California I
[1:19:35] predict this is
[1:19:37] 1964 he doesn't prophesy until 65 he
[1:19:41] says I predict before the coming of the
[1:19:44] Lord
[1:19:45] Jesus that God will sink that place I
[1:19:48] believe that Hollywood and Los Angeles
[1:19:50] and them filthy places over there that
[1:19:52] that God Almighty will sink

[1:19:58] the sea sink them they'll go beneath the

[1:23:48] things I want to tell you in
[1:23:51] 1969 I was surfing the four islands of
[1:23:55] Hawaii backpacking I met a friend of
[1:23:59] mine in alamana Shopping Center High
[1:24:01] School buddy of mine he was a senior I
[1:24:04] was a junior my junior year Easter
[1:24:06] vacation we served over four islands and
[1:24:10] there I met him in the alamoana shopping
[1:24:13] center and I I saw him he's in the
[1:24:15] Sailor suit I said hey buddy man what
[1:24:18] are you doing why weren't you in school
[1:24:20] he said my junior year I quit school and
[1:24:23] I've joined the Navy and I'm on
[1:24:25] America's Most uh nuclear submarine the
[1:24:29] the newest in the American Fleet he said
[1:24:32] would you like to see it are you kidding
[1:24:35] me here I'm 18 years old
[1:24:37] 17 and wow yeah so Pearl Harbor we go to
[1:24:42] Pearl Harbor we wait for hours to get
[1:24:44] the security clearance we get to go
[1:24:46] through the summary long story short how
[1:24:50] deep can you go that's classified how
[1:24:52] how long do you stay down that's
[1:24:54] classified we ask all these classified
[1:24:56] classified he said but because you're
[1:24:59] from Monrovia California I'm from Los
[1:25:02] Angeles born and raised in that area and
[1:25:06] he says I've been on this nuclear
[1:25:10] submarine 28 miles back under under the
[1:25:14] underneath the shelf of California so I
[1:25:17] heard this in
[1:25:20] 1969 that when I heard in 1971 brother
[1:25:24] Braham said California it's it's a
[1:25:27] honeycomb I said amen why because I knew
[1:25:31] I I me your pastor was on the submarine
[1:25:37] talking to the man and him telling me
[1:25:40] that this submarine was 28 milesi and he
[1:25:43] said we could have gone further but a
[1:25:45] submarine doesn't
[1:25:46] pass or excuse me it doesn't back out
[1:25:49] when it gets too narrow What do the
[1:25:52] submarine do it doesn't have a review
[1:25:54] mirror and it backs out of that no it's
[1:25:56] got to do the forward and half thrusters
[1:25:58] and turn itself around it goes by
[1:26:03] sonar oh my my brother my
[1:26:06] sister in fact there were some that the
[1:26:10] prophet of God himself he told them
[1:26:13] brother Mike Patterson's Brother Floyd
[1:26:16] Patterson was out hunting excuse me
[1:26:19] wasn't hunting first time he met brother
[1:26:20] brandham introduced to him he said uh my
[1:26:24] name is Floyd Patterson I'm from
[1:26:25] California and brother brandham if I
[1:26:28] remember correctly he says oh I didn't
[1:26:30] know there was any men left in
[1:26:33] California brother Floyd's eyes raised
[1:26:36] up a little bit he said I tell you what
[1:26:38] the same God that told me about the
[1:26:41] seals and the same God that's revealed
[1:26:43] all these things is the same God that's
[1:26:45] telling me to tell you right now to get
[1:26:48] out of
[1:26:50] it so when we talk about Los Angeles
[1:26:53] sinking and sharks swimming there I take
[1:26:56] it very seriously amen you understand
[1:26:59] now let me just show you something
[1:27:02] brother Brenham in in the sermon the
[1:27:04] Rapture and hope you're from
[1:27:08] Kentucky has there been big waves all
[1:27:12] the way back up into Kentucky
[1:27:16] yet in the sermon of rapture Los Angeles
[1:27:20] is doomed and she's finished I don't
[1:27:23] know when I can tell I Can't Tell You
[1:27:25] Jesus said Capernaum capernum how off
[1:27:28] you that's exalted yourself rather into
[1:27:30] heaven shall be brought down into hell
[1:27:32] for the mighty works that have been done
[1:27:34] in you had been done in Sodom it has
[1:27:36] stood today and about 1550 years from
[1:27:39] there Sodom had already in the earth in
[1:27:41] the earth then Capernaum is in the water
[1:27:44] too today and that same spirit of God
[1:27:46] that said all these things and done all
[1:27:49] these things it said oh City Capernaum
[1:27:52] who called yourself by the name of
[1:27:55] angels Los
[1:27:56] Angelus how you've exalted yourself into
[1:28:00] heaven the very root and seat of Satan
[1:28:02] see you've exalted yourself preachers
[1:28:06] it's a graveyard for them good men go
[1:28:09] there and die like
[1:28:12] rats that's what he
[1:28:14] said you call yourself by the name of
[1:28:17] angels if the mighty Works have been
[1:28:20] done in some Sodom that have been done
[1:28:21] in you it had stood today but your hour
[1:28:25] has come you watch and see if it ain't
[1:28:28] I'm a false
[1:28:30] prophet so this Prophecy of the
[1:28:32] destruction of Los Angeles is not going
[1:28:35] to be some kind of little shaking it's
[1:28:38] not going to be on the city limits where
[1:28:41] just Los Angeles city limits proper are
[1:28:44] going to go down it's going to be a
[1:28:47] major
[1:28:49] catastrophe
[1:28:50] hallelujah how many how many of you
[1:28:52] believe that amen I take it very
[1:28:55] seriously amen now let me share with you
[1:28:59] personal testimony sister Rebecca Smith
[1:29:03] I talked to George Smith about this
[1:29:04] about four days ago as he he had called
[1:29:08] me concerning the passing of brother
[1:29:10] Billy I said while we were how many of
[1:29:13] you remember the Maryland church we were
[1:29:15] over on Maryland this how many years ago
[1:29:18] when they were coming to our church her
[1:29:19] and brother George for about a year and
[1:29:21] a half they came to our church she
[1:29:23] considered me and called me her pastor
[1:29:26] she called me at one time and she said
[1:29:27] brother Ron Billy's very sick if you all
[1:29:30] remember years ago he got real sick had
[1:29:32] to lose a bunch of weight the doctor
[1:29:34] said you need to you need to walk and so
[1:29:36] on and so forth but anyway she says
[1:29:39] brother Ron Billy is near unto death
[1:29:42] right now would it offend you or would
[1:29:45] you be stumbled if he were to pass away
[1:29:48] I said no Rebecca I would not she says
[1:29:51] why wouldn't you be I believe that many
[1:29:53] people in the message will be stumble if
[1:29:55] Billy Paul passes before the
[1:30:00] earthquake and I said well brother
[1:30:02] Brenham doesn't say it on tape he's
[1:30:04] talking to his son they're in a casual
[1:30:07] conversation they're walking downtown I
[1:30:10] believe it's April of 65 they're walking
[1:30:12] downtown I asked Billy Billy tell me
[1:30:16] this exactly to so I know I'm from La I
[1:30:20] want to know what was it that told you
[1:30:23] he said well we were we were downtown
[1:30:25] and we were just walking he said Billy
[1:30:27] where are you he said I'm in California
[1:30:30] he said no be more specific well I'm in
[1:30:34] downtown LA no more specific I'm in
[1:30:39] front of May Company in downtown Los
[1:30:42] Angeles Billy before you're an old man
[1:30:46] sharks will be swimming
[1:30:48] here now there's something that's being
[1:30:50] passed around and I I say this because I
[1:30:53] noticed it was put on your Elf African
[1:30:57] Believers chat site prophecy already
[1:31:01] fulfilled well I want you to be very
[1:31:03] careful I'm your pastor and would have
[1:31:05] said nothing because this isn't the
[1:31:07] first time this has been passed around
[1:31:09] but people are trying to make something
[1:31:13] fit I'm from Los
[1:31:16] Angeles and so I told her I said no
[1:31:19] Rebecca it won't bother me because you
[1:31:21] know what
[1:31:23] I said he doesn't say it on tape it's
[1:31:25] not thus sayith the Lord otherwise we'd
[1:31:29] have to say he was a false prophet
[1:31:30] because Billy Paul already P or or we
[1:31:33] can say we can go ahead and interpret
[1:31:34] well Billy's a young man
[1:31:38] now do you see how we spiritualize or
[1:31:41] even George Smith said well brother Ron
[1:31:43] you know what you know what may come is
[1:31:45] now you know what it is right now it's a
[1:31:47] motion picture academy uh place where
[1:31:51] you can go in in and see all kinds of
[1:31:52] stuff and guess what in the forier they
[1:31:55] have the great white shark from Jaws
[1:31:58] hanging above the shark is swimming in
[1:32:02] May Company in downtown all such
[1:32:06] nonsense amen don't take the
[1:32:09] supernatural out of something When God
[1:32:12] says Hey 1,400 miles a coastline are you
[1:32:16] kidding me some little shaking no this
[1:32:19] YouTube's gone around so the prophecy
[1:32:21] been
[1:32:22] fulfilled oh
[1:32:24] my how I'm from
[1:32:29] La born in Pasadena 14 miles from
[1:32:33] downtown May Company 14
[1:32:36] miles okay any of you made ever ever
[1:32:39] looked at a map of California and seen
[1:32:42] Los Angeles or look where May company's
[1:32:44] at how many of you have ever flown into
[1:32:47] LAX LA
[1:32:49] International when you when you take off
[1:32:51] from La what do you when you take off
[1:32:53] what do you see right below
[1:32:55] you ocean what's the sea
[1:33:00] level it's it's it's right on the coast
[1:33:03] I looked at it last night Google it up
[1:33:05] yourself or ask Tim huler and he can he
[1:33:08] can look and he can get the elevation
[1:33:10] and all of that that Pilots do when they
[1:33:12] come and go from certain places it's 106
[1:33:17] ft above sea level
[1:33:20] LAX 106 it's right on the coast it's
[1:33:23] right
[1:33:24] there take downtown
[1:33:27] LA do you know what that is the
[1:33:30] elevation above sea level it's 325 ft
[1:33:33] above sea level so now this thing is
[1:33:36] that oh hey you know what Paul Harvey
[1:33:39] said there was an earthquake and you
[1:33:41] know what water went all the way up have
[1:33:44] you ever looked at the
[1:33:47] map I want you to see that's 14 to 15
[1:33:51] miles
[1:33:52] and LAX is right there right there
[1:33:56] Marina del re it's right there on the
[1:33:59] coast if there would have been an
[1:34:01] earthquake and a tsunami it had to been
[1:34:04] a tsunami to go into 14 to 15 miles to
[1:34:09] come to May Company with well that would
[1:34:13] have meant 200 ft of
[1:34:16] water would have
[1:34:19] LAX Marina del re
[1:34:22] do you think you'd have heard about
[1:34:25] it it had have been on the news everyone
[1:34:28] my parents lived
[1:34:30] there I never heard oh hey son guess
[1:34:33] what there was a tsunami that went
[1:34:36] downtown LA and out of all of the
[1:34:40] buildings and all of it the only one
[1:34:42] that got water in the basement was May
[1:34:47] Company let me appeal to your Common
[1:34:50] Sense come on
[1:34:52] amen if that happened there' have
[1:34:55] been hundreds of thousands of people
[1:34:58] perhaps
[1:34:59] drowned devastated by a
[1:35:01] flood okay
[1:35:04] because to have that amount of water to
[1:35:06] come in and why would it only flood the
[1:35:09] basement of M
[1:35:11] company so was it a little earthquake
[1:35:15] and it had a
[1:35:16] pipeline and it went straight over here
[1:35:18] and went to me company and so sharks
[1:35:20] were s women in the basement of May
[1:35:24] Company got to be kidding
[1:35:27] me so I appeal to your common sense
[1:35:31] because if somebody can say this day
[1:35:32] this scripture this prophecy is
[1:35:34] fulfilled I say read and what he does
[1:35:39] say you know what it's a casual
[1:35:41] conversation that he was having with
[1:35:43] Billy Paul he doesn't say thus sayth the
[1:35:45] Lord he doesn't don't try to overs
[1:35:47] spiritualize something I can walk along
[1:35:50] you can go with your son you can take
[1:35:52] your son Jonathan out and you might be
[1:35:54] talking to him hey Jonathan before I'm
[1:35:56] an old man thus and thus happened
[1:35:58] probably this and that and it's just you
[1:36:02] talking my brother my sister let us say
[1:36:06] what he says let us stay with the
[1:36:08] scripture I don't want nobody's opinion
[1:36:11] now if you want to preach that in your
[1:36:13] church and you want to tell people it's
[1:36:15] that's fine you go ahead brother Brenham
[1:36:17] said he said brandham Tabernacle you
[1:36:20] voted dman Neville in as your pastor if
[1:36:23] he wants to preach Jehovah's Witness
[1:36:25] Doctrine that's
[1:36:27] fine that's up to him but I say to to
[1:36:31] you and I'm your pastor and I am held
[1:36:35] responsible so be real careful passing
[1:36:38] around these little YouTubes and one
[1:36:40] says well now this and that and some
[1:36:43] here say there and some here say over
[1:36:45] there
[1:36:46] nonsense stop it God don't need you to
[1:36:50] try to bring something to pass God don't
[1:36:52] need you to interpret it God will
[1:36:54] interpret his word by bringing it to
[1:36:56] pass and one day 1,400 miles a close
[1:37:00] Line's going to slip
[1:37:02] off I was with Dr SC Jacob in madros
[1:37:07] India he is a doctor professor of
[1:37:10] geology he says I studied years about
[1:37:14] earthquakes and I studied geology and he
[1:37:17] says I've come here to Los
[1:37:19] Angeles and he says and I studied he
[1:37:22] said the whole thing of Los Angeles he
[1:37:25] said it's on pillars and he said the
[1:37:27] type of
[1:37:28] sand and the type of geographic
[1:37:32] geological strata he says it will slip
[1:37:36] into the ocean when it starts to break
[1:37:39] the San Andreas Fault when it breaks
[1:37:42] brother Bram said there below San Diego
[1:37:45] coming me up through uh uh uh Los
[1:37:48] Angeles going up north towards San
[1:37:50] Francisco up into the uan
[1:37:53] islands come on my brother my sister
[1:37:56] don't let somebody to try to
[1:37:58] misinterpret something to you but if you
[1:38:00] want to believe that you go ahead as far
[1:38:02] as me no I'm sorry I don't say it's been
[1:38:06] fulfilled you take it or leave it
[1:38:09] amen all right all right amen I say say
[1:38:14] What's on those tapes now let me switch
[1:38:17] gears because I'm talking about the
[1:38:18] revealing of the son of man I just had
[1:38:20] to say that because you know what Monday
[1:38:22] they ask when is Billy Paul going to be
[1:38:24] buried Monday about 10:00 in
[1:38:28] Jeffersonville it's a private
[1:38:33] ceremony it's not
[1:38:35] everybody private ceremony that's what
[1:38:37] Brother Joseph has asked so okay but now
[1:38:42] all of this stuff being passed around
[1:38:44] and you know and they made the interview
[1:38:48] of Billy
[1:38:49] Paul uh and the different things that's
[1:38:51] on this when Billy Paul was 83 that's
[1:38:54] five years ago right 82 83 five six
[1:38:58] years ago
[1:39:01] so I I just say my brother my sister I'm
[1:39:05] not picking on anybody I'm not going
[1:39:07] after anybody but if you're going to be
[1:39:09] bold enough to put it out there on the
[1:39:13] internet saying this day this scripture
[1:39:15] is fulfilled and passing it around to
[1:39:18] everybody then I have a right
[1:39:22] myself as a brother to say sorry I don't
[1:39:25] swallow it now I'm going to switch gears
[1:39:28] is that okay come on I'm going to switch
[1:39:31] gears now and actually go to my sermon
[1:39:33] this morning on the revealing of the son
[1:39:35] of man now I want all of you to
[1:39:37] understand that you and I have all been
[1:39:39] aware and made uh known a unique
[1:39:43] Ministry of a man called William
[1:39:45] brandham and brother brandham began to
[1:39:48] preach a unique Ministry and he had a
[1:39:51] unique Ministry now he was not the first
[1:39:54] one to have Divine Healing that he was
[1:39:58] preaching to the people in this age he
[1:40:01] was not go back and read the history he
[1:40:05] was not there was other Smith
[1:40:07] Wigglesworth and different ones had
[1:40:09] healing campaigns in fact Smith
[1:40:11] Wigglesworth he was so bold that if a
[1:40:13] woman had a uh a tumor on her neck
[1:40:17] perhaps a cancer he'd say come here in
[1:40:19] the name of Jesus Christ and he'd slap
[1:40:21] her as f as fast and as hard as he could
[1:40:25] and sometimes these things had fall off
[1:40:27] in fact I'll have you bear witness
[1:40:28] brother brandham said you watch Smith's
[1:40:31] Wiggles were passed away and within
[1:40:33] within 24 hours I was on the seat go
[1:40:37] look at the
[1:40:38] quote so it was not his first and second
[1:40:42] pull no he just spearheaded a
[1:40:48] Evangelistic Healing Ministry he did and
[1:40:52] he went from first pull healing to
[1:40:54] Second pull discernment now that was far
[1:40:57] above all the rest of these healers
[1:40:59] because now he's beginning to discern
[1:41:02] their hearts you in the red dress yes
[1:41:04] sister God just you know and you were
[1:41:07] talking to your husband or you were in
[1:41:09] the car and you this and I saw the
[1:41:11] doctor he's telling you you've got this
[1:41:13] and that are those things true yes yes
[1:41:16] you see what I'm saying he went far and
[1:41:19] so as Moses Moes was given two signs
[1:41:22] you'll be given two signs and so he was
[1:41:25] given a sign of healing and of
[1:41:27] discernment but he said that's an
[1:41:29] attracting pool that gets the people to
[1:41:31] understand that he's got a message
[1:41:34] coming it wasn't that wasn't the
[1:41:37] sign the Halo above his head was not the
[1:41:41] sign the cloud was not the sign the sign
[1:41:45] was the voice behind the sign the voice
[1:41:49] within a voice
[1:41:51] do you understand there was a picture
[1:41:54] within the picture and it Bears you
[1:41:56] witness every one of you it's not
[1:41:59] everyone that hears a tape understands
[1:42:01] the
[1:42:03] revealing many of them saw the ministry
[1:42:06] a great powerful man of God they saw it
[1:42:10] but they never understood the ministry
[1:42:12] behind it
[1:42:15] amen now all kinds of doctrines all
[1:42:18] kinds of isms I'm the eighth messenger
[1:42:21] I'm the Elisha I'm uh uh the minister
[1:42:24] after brother Brenham I'm the one that's
[1:42:26] coming after him I have the Joshua
[1:42:28] Ministry I'm taking the bride over I've
[1:42:31] seen them all yes
[1:42:33] sir
[1:42:34] now watch we got to stay in the middle
[1:42:38] of the road not follow this fanaticism
[1:42:41] or this lukewarm
[1:42:44] starchy God help us stay in the middle
[1:42:46] of the road anointed ones at the end
[1:42:49] time follow along the very day that the
[1:42:52] son of man is revealed Revelations 10
[1:42:56] 1-7 read it when you get home the
[1:42:59] seventh Angel's message opening up the
[1:43:03] seals what is it not the angel is the
[1:43:06] son of man but the messenger is
[1:43:09] revealing the son of man can you get it
[1:43:12] separated now that's where it seems to
[1:43:15] be so hard for you you see not the son
[1:43:19] of man himself but the seventh angel the
[1:43:23] seventh messenger is revealing to the
[1:43:26] public the son of man because it's left
[1:43:29] the
[1:43:30] shock it can't organize it it's grain
[1:43:34] itself again and in that day Janice and
[1:43:37] jambre will withstood anointed ones make
[1:43:40] Believers unbelievers the church formal
[1:43:43] and the
[1:43:44] Pentecostals stand up against the true
[1:43:47] graen and let them alone their Folly
[1:43:49] will be made manifest
[1:43:51] as there's with see you understand now
[1:43:54] you see Hallelujah my brother my sister
[1:43:56] we got to look I'm talking
[1:44:00] about there is also a change of
[1:44:04] ministry and a change of administration
[1:44:07] you see it in every age you see it in
[1:44:09] every
[1:44:12] Ministry I've told
[1:44:14] you the prophet was feeling in his
[1:44:17] Spirit there's going to be a change in
[1:44:19] fact he preaches this sermon several
[1:44:21] times called change of ministry letting
[1:44:24] us know something's happening he starts
[1:44:27] in 57 he goes on watch this and come
[1:44:30] follow me here in Tucson he says I
[1:44:33] started to turn around the Holy Spirit
[1:44:34] come upon me I asked Leo for a pen I got
[1:44:37] a piece of paper I wrote it God will
[1:44:40] never change the ministry but he will
[1:44:42] change the man with the ministry that's
[1:44:46] what's to be done you see see I can't do
[1:44:50] it in the condition I am now because
[1:44:54] something has got to happen within
[1:44:56] me that will take and that will take God
[1:44:59] to do it I want all of you to understand
[1:45:02] we can say we got faith to do this we
[1:45:04] got faith to do that but I want to talk
[1:45:06] to you about a higher faith not talking
[1:45:09] about uh just the healing of this body
[1:45:12] I'm talking about a transformation in
[1:45:14] this body I'm talking about rapturing
[1:45:17] faith I'm talking about a faith that's
[1:45:19] going to rapture you it's going to
[1:45:21] change you in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:45:24] an eye I'm not going back because I I
[1:45:26] want to ask you which is a greater
[1:45:30] healing spiritual or
[1:45:33] physical which is greater to have
[1:45:36] physical eyes open or spiritual eyes
[1:45:38] open which is greater to see a man who
[1:45:42] is dead in sin and trespasses to catch
[1:45:46] the word of God and his eyes come open
[1:45:49] and you who were dead in sin and in
[1:45:51] trespasses hath God quickened
[1:45:54] you which is greater when he becomes
[1:45:57] born again that's a far greater oh are
[1:46:01] you listening to me it's far greater
[1:46:03] than your natural
[1:46:06] birth praise the
[1:46:08] Lord everybody want to go back to these
[1:46:11] healings and stuff the healings never
[1:46:13] stopped the healings continue why these
[1:46:16] signs follow them that believe lay hands
[1:46:19] on the sick they shall recover but
[1:46:20] there's a higher there's a higher
[1:46:24] order how many of you believe
[1:46:27] that listen I'm going to preach here in
[1:46:30] the near I'm going to give you a future

[1:59:36] your family is crumbling and your oh God

[2:06:37] had short hair all and got I still got
[2:06:39] long hair but
[2:06:41] it's much
[2:06:46] shorter I looked in the mirror
[2:06:49] and I was
[2:06:51] ashamed it says it's a shame to have
[2:06:54] long hair as a man but to a woman it's
[2:06:57] her glory that's why do you sisters let

[2:07:01] ever cut it don't you ever trim it he
[2:07:03] said God gave it to you it's a
[2:07:07] power and because of the angels He said
[2:07:10] it's an Abomination if you ever cut your
[2:07:12] hair trim it he said if you cut it off
[2:07:15] the Apostle Paul said if you're going to
[2:07:16] cut it cut it all off
[2:07:20] I looked in the mirror I saw that long
[2:07:22] hair I threw it back like I I was said I
[2:07:26] said oh God I'm

[2:07:31] death to self you see when Christ bid
[2:07:34] you to
[2:07:36] come he bid you to come and
[2:07:39] die to follow
[2:07:41] Christ is to come and die he who seeks
[2:07:44] to save his life will lose it but he who
[2:07:47] seeks to say to to lose his life for my
[2:07:51] sake will find
[2:07:54] it
[2:08:05] amen the levitical and ironic priesthood
[2:08:09] brother brandham said
[2:08:11] ceased at
[2:08:13] Calvary he said wasn't
[2:08:16] destroyed but that

[2:08:43] you following
[2:08:47] me Jesus Jesus said I did not come to
[2:08:49] you to destroy the
