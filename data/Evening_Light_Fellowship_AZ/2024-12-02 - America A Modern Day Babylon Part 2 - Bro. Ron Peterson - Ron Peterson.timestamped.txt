[26:21] on his own takes the Holy Spirit to give

[26:27] chap 10
[26:29] verses 8-10 and Kush begat
[26:33] Nimrod and he began to be a Mighty Man a
[26:37] mighty one on in the earth and he was a
[26:41] mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore
[26:44] it is said even as Nimrod the mighty
[26:46] Hunter before the
[26:48] Lord and the beginning of his kingdom
[26:52] was
[26:53] Babel everything has a beginning Genesis
[26:57] is the book of at beginning now brother
[26:59] Brenham said that watch you see what
[27:02] starts there in Genesis and goes all the
[27:04] way down through to the Book of
[27:06] Revelation so we see something began
[27:09] back then a kingdom a kingdom called
[27:13] Babylon and Babylon is not just a
[27:18] physical Kingdom but a
[27:21] spiritual
[27:24] entity and the Bible talks about mystery
[27:28] Babylon so I'd like to read that also
[27:31] Revelation chap
[27:34] 17 verses 1-
[27:38] six and there came one of the Seven
[27:40] Angels which had the seven vials and
[27:43] talked with me saying unto me come
[27:46] hither I will show unto thee the
[27:49] Judgment of the great that sth
[27:52] upon many
[27:53] Waters with whom the kings of the Earth
[27:56] have committed fornication
[28:00] and the inhabitants of the Earth have
[28:03] been made drunk with the wine of her
[28:06] fornication so he carried me away in the
[28:09] spirit in the wilderness and I saw a
[28:11] woman sit on a Scarlet colored Beast
[28:14] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[28:18] heads and 10 horns and the woman was
[28:21] arrayed in purple and scarlet
[28:24] color and decked with gold and precious
[28:27] stones and
[28:29] Pearls having a golden cup in her hand
[28:33] full of
[28:34] Abominations and filthiness of her
[28:38] fornication and upon her head was a name
[28:41] written mystery Babylon the great the
[28:44] mother of
[28:46] harlots and
[28:47] Abominations of the earth and I saw the
[28:51] woman
[28:53] drunken not with inspiration
[28:59] drunk with the
[29:03] blood of the
[29:05] Saints you want to know who she's
[29:09] after if you're a
[29:12] Christian if you're one of the sainted
[29:14] ones of
[29:16] God she would love to devour you and
[29:19] drink your
[29:21] blood and she is drunk the Bible says
[29:25] with the blood of the Saints and with
[29:26] the blood of the martyrs of
[29:29] Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with
[29:34] great
[29:35] admiration heavenly father I pray a
[29:38] blessing upon Thy word I pray that you
[29:40] will Open the Eyes of our understanding
[29:42] Lord that we might know in this end time
[29:46] who is this mystery Babylon how far does
[29:49] it reach and make sure father that we
[29:52] have no part of matalon within us am we
[29:55] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[29:58] bless you you can be seated this morning
[30:01] in the presence of
[30:04] God as I read there in Genesis and we
[30:07] look at how something
[30:09] begins and brother Bram says when you
[30:12] take it back and he says you look at
[30:14] Kush who was begat who begat Nimrod but
[30:19] if you study it Kush is is The
[30:22] Descendant or the son of ham who is the
[30:26] son of Noah and brother random said we
[30:29] see the serpent the seed of the serpent
[30:32] came through ham I always can remember
[30:36] that because I have relational
[30:37] Association ham is a comes from a
[30:45] pig think on
[30:48] that can't change the ways of a
[30:53] pig a pig is a
[30:56] pig every seed will bring forth of its
[30:59] own
[31:00] kind
[31:01] amen so we see here something began back
[31:05] there in Genesis and the beginning the
[31:08] beginning didn't say the end of his
[31:11] kingdom the beginning of his kingdom was
[31:15] Babel so I'm titling my sermon this
[31:19] morning
[31:21] America a modern day Babylon this is
[31:24] part
[31:25] two and we are the subject of the
[31:29] handwriting on the
[31:31] wall now what is happening in America
[31:34] today is actually biblical
[31:37] prophecy we are found our country is
[31:41] found as a nation in Revelation chap
[31:46] 13 started out with two horns civil and
[31:49] ecclesiastical powers and looked like a
[31:52] lamb but turned out when it raises and
[31:56] grows up and matures it
[31:58] becomes a
[32:00] dragon and speaks like a dragon and
[32:04] makes war with those so don't think that
[32:08] America and I don't want all of you to
[32:10] say well praise God Trump is in the
[32:12] office now things are going to get
[32:15] better they
[32:20] ain't it's just going to I I I tell you
[32:24] I think what it is the only thing I can
[32:27] say that
[32:28] I'm happy
[32:30] about is the fact that at least it
[32:32] showed that there's enough people in
[32:34] America that don't want the other way of
[32:39] leadership and yet brother Bram said you
[32:41] can put an Abraham Lincoln in a George
[32:45] Washington in every office you'll not
[32:47] change America so America is on her way
[32:51] down she what you are witnessing are the
[32:54] death death throws
[33:01] H
[33:03] gasping like a drunk man that's
[33:07] reeling that he's walking and he's just
[33:11] about
[33:13] ready to
[33:15] fall and this nation of ours has sown
[33:21] her seed for so
[33:23] long and understand that God is Not
[33:26] mocked amen for whatsoever you
[33:30] sow that shall you reap for you if you
[33:34] sow to the flesh you shall of the flesh
[33:37] reap corruption but if you sow unto the
[33:41] spirit you shall of the spirit reap
[33:44] everlasting
[33:48] life Babylon did not
[33:51] cease with the
[33:53] Babylon of the time of Nebuchadnezzar
[33:56] it's a spirit
[34:01] and we can see the types and
[34:03] shadows within the scripture brother
[34:05] Brenham would go back and he says as it
[34:08] was in the days of Daniel as it was in
[34:11] the days of Noah as it was in the days
[34:13] of Abraham or go on and he will show you
[34:16] so you can go back to those scriptures
[34:19] you can read and it'll show you what was
[34:22] going on in Babylon then gives you a
[34:25] picture of what will happen to the
[34:27] Babylon
[34:28] now so as it was so shall it
[34:32] be we see this is a time of political
[34:36] and governmental pressures put upon the
[34:38] people exactly as it was in the time of
[34:43] Daniel remember that Israel because of
[34:47] their Disobedience to God's word were
[34:50] taken
[34:52] captive by Babylon and they were put
[34:55] under political pressure govern mental
[34:59] pressures but there was one that refused
[35:01] to eat the food of the king he had
[35:04] spiritual food and he fared far better
[35:07] than those who ate of of the King's food
[35:11] who was that that was Daniel there were
[35:13] others that were
[35:15] influenced under Daniel's Ministry in
[35:18] fact there was a
[35:19] pressure watch this that Daniel after
[35:24] that he reads and gives the
[35:26] interpretation of the handwriting on the
[35:29] wall is lifted up but guess what when
[35:33] he's lifted up they wanted to worship
[35:37] Daniel and Shadrach meach and abedo the
[35:41] three Hebrew children the reason they
[35:43] went through a fiery trial was because
[35:47] they refused to bow to the image of
[35:50] Daniel and brother Bram said because
[35:52] watch the kingdom the Gentile Kingdom
[35:55] came came in with the word worship of a
[35:58] man it goes out with the worship of a
[36:02] man so we see these things
[36:06] spiritually their persecution LED them
[36:09] to the Lion's
[36:11] Den LED them
[36:13] to the fiery furnace but let me say this
[36:19] as a side
[36:21] note the Lion's Den and the fiery
[36:25] furnace was a trial that brought them to
[36:28] their
[36:31] Deliverance they had to go through it to
[36:35] experience to come out without the smell
[36:37] of
[36:39] smoke and you wonder why you're going
[36:41] through such fiery
[36:43] trials God knows exactly what he's doing
[36:46] let's quit worrying about well why am I
[36:49] in this why is this gone why why why
[36:51] stop and just say God it's all in your
[36:53] hands how many can quit asking why and
[36:56] just saying okay what do I need to
[36:59] do amen what do I need to do excuse me
[37:05] now brother Brenham said in the five
[37:07] definite identifications of the True
[37:10] Church of the Living
[37:12] God but as I travel around the world I
[37:16] find every nation has its own spirit and
[37:20] all nations are controlled by the devil
[37:22] somebody say all all yeah all the
[37:25] nations so yeah America so bad I'm going
[37:28] to go to the
[37:29] UK I'm going to go to Australia all
[37:34] nations are controlled by the devil all
[37:39] governments are ruled by the devil the
[37:42] Bible said so they fight they war and
[37:45] they will till Jesus comes then he'll
[37:47] set up a
[37:49] kingdom and there'll be no war but Satan
[37:52] said that all the kingdoms of the world
[37:55] was his and he do with them whatever he
[37:58] wanted to write in the face of Jesus
[38:00] Christ they're all Satan's instruments
[38:03] Satan's
[38:07] kingdom so I want you to all
[38:11] understand that the whole
[38:14] system around the world and all
[38:18] governments in all countries are
[38:21] influenced of the wicked
[38:24] one it's coming to a head brother
[38:27] Brandon with the opening of The Seven
[38:28] Seals he said watch that seven seal has
[38:32] to do with his coming right and he says
[38:36] it's the end of all
[38:38] things it's the end of of this world
[38:43] it's the end of the political system
[38:45] it's the end it's the end of all things
[38:48] thank God we're coming to the end of all
[38:52] of these issues because there is another
[38:55] kingdom coming in can you say Amen to
[38:58] that a whole another kingdom that's
[39:00] being ushered in right now how long does
[39:03] that ushering take it's just depends on
[39:06] the wedding
[39:07] ceremony some
[39:09] weddings that bride is ushered in you
[39:12] know you have the music
[39:16] and and then somebody stands up they all
[39:19] stand and they look and then slowly
[39:22] she's being ushered in
[39:31] and slowly she comes down the aisle how
[39:33] long does that take depends on the
[39:35] wedding ceremony some of them like
[39:37] brother Ron cut to the chase buddy we
[39:40] want to just come in say I do you may
[39:43] kiss the bride that's it we're
[39:46] happy but this ushering
[39:49] in is happening right now there's an
[39:53] ushering in of a whole another kingdom
[39:56] and we see these two kingdoms are in
[39:59] conflict because you have the kingdom of
[40:01] God and the kingdom of this world and
[40:03] they are totally opposite of one another
[40:07] and if you feel comfortable in this
[40:09] Kingdom I doubt you belong to God's
[40:13] kingdom because Jesus said those that
[40:16] live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[40:22] persecution
[40:24] amen greatest battle ever fought brother
[40:26] Braham says rulers of
[40:28] Darkness who rules the world the devil
[40:34] certainly who is all these things coming
[40:36] on all these ungodly things going on
[40:39] around uh uh through here and these
[40:43] governments and so forth It's all the
[40:45] devil the Bible said so the devil
[40:48] controls the United States yeah the
[40:52] devil controls
[40:55] Germany and the devil controls every
[40:57] nation in the
[40:59] world I'm coming to it in just a few
[41:01] minutes we'll find out whether he does
[41:03] or not every Kingdom there ever was and
[41:07] ever will
[41:08] be until God sets up his kingdom is
[41:13] controlled by the
[41:15] devil I don't mean everybody in it is
[41:18] the devil now there's Godly men in
[41:21] government
[41:24] offices but there are few and far
[41:26] between amen
[41:29] God's seat is always
[41:33] minority understanding do you know that
[41:37] President Obama was the first president
[41:39] of the United States it says America is
[41:41] no longer a Christian
[41:44] Nation he declared it he said we are a
[41:47] secular Nation we're a
[41:50] mixture he himself he's not black nor
[41:54] white he claims to be black since
[41:58] whenn do you have when you have a white
[42:02] mother and a black father that makes you
[42:03] black you may have negroid
[42:06] features but you go over into Africa
[42:10] into certain tribes they would never say
[42:12] he's
[42:14] negro because or it's just we're we're
[42:19] in a
[42:20] mixed time a mixing of a white horse
[42:24] rider and a black horse rider brings
[42:26] forth
[42:28] appeal do you understand it's mixing of
[42:31] Creeds it's a mixing of doctrines it's a
[42:35] mixing of
[42:42] seed you know I don't know if you've saw
[42:45] in the news but Camala Harris has no
[42:50] negro ancestry in
[42:52] her if any of you have seen that and
[42:54] they say well this is going to be the
[42:56] first black
[42:57] president are you kidding
[42:59] me it was a
[43:02] falsehood it's it's being proven she has
[43:04] no negro blood within
[43:08] her in fact when she and I'm not trying
[43:11] to make anything
[43:13] political but it was just a falsehood to
[43:16] pretend she's something to get their
[43:20] vote because when she started into her
[43:25] governmental uh whatever governor and
[43:27] all that kind of stuff she was Asian of
[43:31] Indian
[43:33] descent so well which one of you well I
[43:37] want you to understand today well I
[43:39] don't feel like being white so I think
[43:41] I'll be black I don't feel like being
[43:44] black so I'll be
[43:46] Asian I don't feel like being a man so
[43:49] I'll be a
[43:50] woman you can be whatever you want to be
[43:53] you just it's whatever you identify with
[43:56] and I don't mean to make that a joke
[43:58] because it's a reality we live around I
[44:02] was over in Australia landed in
[44:04] Australia it was just going to another
[44:07] uh uh making you know a connection and
[44:11] they got two lines and I always look I'm
[44:13] at the gate and I'm always going to
[44:14] choose the shorter line try to go you
[44:16] know but Murphy's
[44:18] Law always seems to come up and I'm in
[44:21] the L line and I'm just you know
[44:23] somebody Taps me on the shoulder uh
[44:25] excuse me yes yes I think you're in the
[44:27] wrong line well I look around and this
[44:30] is all women and over here is all
[44:33] men and so I said well today I think
[44:36] I'll be a
[44:38] woman this was years ago and everybody
[44:41] went like that I said no really as I'll
[44:43] go over there and get with the
[44:46] men America was founded upon Christian
[44:51] principles the Constitution was forged
[44:55] in the fiery trial
[44:58] of government tyranny to Rise Up from
[45:02] the United Kingdom and government
[45:05] tyranny and declare ourselves as a
[45:08] Sovereign
[45:10] Nation they had a Boston Tea Party
[45:14] because of taxation without
[45:20] representation
[45:22] my do you
[45:25] understand how the
[45:27] God was
[45:29] mentioned in our
[45:31] constitution in our laws in our
[45:34] bylaws it was in our Halls of Justice
[45:38] when people came and went into a
[45:41] courtroom put your hand on the Bible do
[45:43] you swear to tell the truth the whole
[45:44] truth nothing but the truth so help you
[45:47] God there was a fear of God God was on
[45:50] our money God was I pledge allegiance to
[45:55] the flag now nowadays they pledge
[45:58] nothing I pledge to fight everything and
[46:00] go against everything that you ever
[46:02] stand
[46:05] for Kneel for God and stand for the
[46:09] flag this is a nation I believe that we
[46:12] I am a patriot but I put God
[46:18] first amen I'm not on a political
[46:22] platform this morning and I don't want
[46:24] anybody to think that but we're in the
[46:26] time
[46:28] that Babylon is right here and in every
[46:33] classroom they used to say the pledge
[46:42] allegiance our our
[46:44] forefathers
[46:46] fought to
[46:48] gain religious and political
[46:53] Freedom one nation under God indivisible
[47:01] they gave their lives for
[47:03] it America today is in the midst of a
[47:08] religious
[47:10] persecution a battle for your god-given
[47:15] rights
[47:16] anti-semite semitism is now reaching an
[47:19] all-time high
[47:22] since the times of the second World War
[47:27] and people are standing and watching
[47:30] Jews getting beaten just because they're
[47:38] Jews Christians are not allowed to pray
[47:42] in
[47:44] schools teachers and coaches are not
[47:47] allowed to
[47:48] pray with their classrooms or with the
[47:51] team before or after a
[47:55] game not allowed to to pray in our
[47:57] governmental buildings but you know
[47:59] what's an amazing thing let something
[48:02] happen that is a of some sort of
[48:06] catastrophic event and everybody says oh
[48:09] let's
[48:12] pray you better start praying
[48:19] now Satan has polluted our
[48:22] schools our families our churches
[48:27] he's invaded our
[48:29] pulpits invaded our government doing
[48:32] everything he can right now to invade
[48:34] the message and the
[48:39] ministry somebody has been sending me
[48:42] little clips of things about the message
[48:44] that have been recently here in our
[48:48] local paper here in
[48:51] Arizona these are just flashing red
[48:54] lights
[48:57] realize something's coming the
[49:00] government's looking at
[49:02] you politics are looking at you you
[49:05] people are weird you're
[49:08] Fanatics there's something wrong with
[49:10] you you believe in some kind of a
[49:12] prophet yes we
[49:17] do America now has become another modern
[49:21] day Babylon our governments
[49:23] corrupt our schools have become corrupt
[49:28] and he's doing everything he can to
[49:30] corrupt our
[49:32] churches thank
[49:34] God that he sent a prophet in this end
[49:37] time that we might know what's going on
[49:39] thank God for this prophetic Ministry
[49:41] amen thank God for it otherwise you'd be
[49:43] swallowed right up into this movement
[49:46] that you know God loves everybody
[49:48] doesn't matter how you live doesn't
[49:50] matter how you dress then why does God
[49:52] put it in his word
[49:59] am in the sermon contending for the
[50:03] faith he says there's a phenomena of
[50:06] this way of the holy spirit moves and
[50:09] the meetings that's been very strange to
[50:11] the American
[50:13] people because that there's such a mixup
[50:16] among the American people so many
[50:18] different
[50:19] denominations with so many different
[50:22] phases of which of which way they
[50:25] believe and they become
[50:27] so
[50:29] indoc so indument there that's a word
[50:33] brother brenon made
[50:35] up he means
[50:38] indoctrinated but
[50:56] talk about a people that's all messed up
[50:58] that doesn't know what they
[51:01] believe in the sermon that called
[51:07] out last evening it was laid upon my
[51:11] heart to speak on the subject the
[51:13] handwriting on the
[51:14] wall and the Lord did bless us and not
[51:18] only did he bless us but he furthered
[51:20] his kingdom by letting us read his word
[51:23] and to let the Holy Spirit reveal to us
[51:26] the things that's so close at
[51:29] hand and in doing so we type the great
[51:32] modern
[51:34] Babylon with the great modern America
[51:37] and we found out that in this nation of
[51:40] ours today we found ourselves in the
[51:42] same kind of a fix they were in when
[51:45] they had the handwriting on the
[51:48] wall and we also found out that we had
[51:52] uh and the same conditions morally
[51:54] speaking so he's looking into Ty of what
[51:57] it was then to what it is now
[52:00] yeah I want you to understand
[52:03] Daniel with his prophetic Vision could
[52:06] see the handwriting on the wall nobody
[52:08] else could understand
[52:10] it it was unknown
[52:13] tongues it was God's hand that came down
[52:16] that wrote on the wall and nobody
[52:18] understood
[52:19] it and Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon
[52:22] was scared and he brought all his souss
[52:24] and brought him all together what does
[52:25] this mean
[52:28] brother Brenham says that's what's
[52:30] happening in America today I see the
[52:32] same signs and I'm here to tell you I'm
[52:35] reading the handwriting that's on the
[52:37] wall in America you're ready for
[52:46] Destruction there is only
[52:48] one major difference between us and
[52:52] denominational
[52:55] Christianity and that is the lack of the
[52:57] revelation of the holy
[52:59] spirit because the Holy Spirit cannot
[53:03] deny God's word because the holy spirit
[53:07] is the author of the
[53:09] word so brother Brenham gives us time
[53:12] after time if you say you have the Holy
[53:16] Spirit and you're a woman and you say I
[53:19] feel no conviction about cutting my hair
[53:22] he said it's not the Holy Spirit you
[53:25] have you have of a
[53:30] religious you understand religious
[53:34] spirit doesn't condemn me to paint my
[53:38] face paint my
[53:40] nails do those things that the world
[53:44] does he says I can see
[53:46] why and I want you to understand all of
[53:49] these and I'm going to label this
[53:53] Feelgood churches
[53:57] because the churches out there are not
[54:00] going to tell you you need to live a
[54:01] holy
[54:02] life the Bible says without Holiness no
[54:05] man shall see
[54:07] God they will not tell you uh uh that
[54:11] it's wrong to get divorced and remarried
[54:13] and all of that stuff they don't in fact
[54:16] they're full of
[54:18] counseling we just give you counsel we
[54:20] we've got counselors for those of you
[54:22] that are all going through some trials
[54:24] and we all got trials even among the
[54:26] message just because you are married
[54:32] together and it says now I pronounce you
[54:37] husband and wife you may kiss the
[54:39] bride and you introduce them and go live
[54:43] happily ever for after that's a fairy
[54:49] tale because you know what you're going
[54:51] to have difficulties in your Mar I don't
[54:53] care how good that marriage is how long
[54:56] it's been together you still got
[54:59] issues oh don't sit there like you're
[55:01] sanctimonious and you no you're going to
[55:04] have issues but it's only the holy
[55:08] spirit in your lives that's going to
[55:10] keep you bound together
[55:14] amen God help us to tell the truth to
[55:17] our people you young

[57:45] lunch of course you know he and I and
[57:47] Mitch Buckingham we all came to the

[58:01] up next thing you know he's
[58:03] divorced goes back to
[58:06] California leaves the
[58:10] message bring it up to December 6 of
[58:14] last year just a few days away this was
[58:17] my birthday so I take him out for lunch
[58:19] for my
[58:20] birthday our
[58:23] birthday I make him wait 6 minutes
[58:27] because I'm 6 minutes older and
[58:31] then I told him I and he starts I don't
[58:35] know what was he had a bur under his
[58:38] saddle do you know the expression he
[58:40] just was upset he just didn't well you
[58:43] know what you know what how I feel about
[58:45] the people in this message they're all
[58:48] Hypocrites they're just a bunch of
[58:50] Hypocrites and on and on and the more he
[58:53] starts going on I said hey hey I call
[58:55] him
[58:56] brv we couldn't say brother we said
[58:59] brother and we shortened it to
[59:02] brv so everybody growing up knowing us
[59:05] as twins they just didn't say Ron and
[59:08] Don they said the brvs hey
[59:10] brv I told my brother I said BR stop it
[59:14] I'm here to just have lunch why well you
[59:18] just can't take it and you know what I
[59:20] don't like coming to your church I said
[59:22] why come yeah well I feel condemned
[59:25] every every time I come and I said I
[59:28] said you should feel condemned because
[59:30] you want to
[59:31] drink you want a
[59:33] date you want to the movies and the
[59:37] things of the world and you don't want
[59:39] anybody to tell you what to
[59:42] do and I said so you come to church and
[59:44] you sit right there and everybody kind
[59:46] of thinks that he's my twin brother than
[59:49] he believes the message he
[59:52] don't so I told him and said why come
[59:56] so he hasn't come
[59:57] since I'm just being honest with
[1:00:01] you it hurts me with my own
[1:00:05] family when they walk away from
[1:00:08] it I can't make anybody believe
[1:00:11] it do you understand that I can't make
[1:00:14] anybody believe
[1:00:16] it I'm just saying that we're in the
[1:00:20] midst of a modern day Babylon right
[1:00:23] now and she's giving out
[1:00:26] a cup full of the wine of her
[1:00:30] fornication what is fornication unclean
[1:00:33] living is that
[1:00:36] right
[1:00:42] am I said revelation of the spirit is
[1:00:46] what makes us different not the moving
[1:00:49] of the spirit or the anointing of the
[1:00:51] spirit because the anointing one the
[1:00:53] anointed ones of the end he said it's
[1:00:55] the Gen Holy Spirit falling upon seed
[1:00:58] and
[1:01:01] nonseed do they not raise up and worship
[1:01:05] God do they not feel his presence why
[1:01:08] his reain falls on the just and the
[1:01:12] unjust Matthew 5:43 and 48 you have
[1:01:16] heard it is both been said Thou shalt
[1:01:18] love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy
[1:01:21] but I say unto you love your
[1:01:24] enemies bless them the C curse you do
[1:01:26] good to them that hate you and pray for
[1:01:28] them which despitefully use you and
[1:01:30] persecute
[1:01:32] you that you may be the children of your
[1:01:34] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:01:37] his son to rise on the evil on the evil
[1:01:40] and on the good and sendeth his Reign on
[1:01:44] the just and the unjust now if I was God
[1:01:47] I wouldn't do
[1:01:48] that because I'm carnally
[1:01:52] thinking well no I'm only going to let
[1:01:55] my anointing my my goodness and my
[1:01:57] blessing come upon only my seed but no
[1:02:00] he lets it Go upon seed and nonseed are
[1:02:04] we together on
[1:02:07] that the name Babylon comes from the the
[1:02:11] word Bal b a l a l it means
[1:02:17] confusion and you get babyon it's it's a
[1:02:21] compound Hebrew word which actually
[1:02:23] means the Gate of God
[1:02:27] so remember when they made the Tower of
[1:02:29] Babel they were thinking we're making a
[1:02:32] Stairway to Heaven this is our way to
[1:02:35] get to
[1:02:39] God but we understand there's only one
[1:02:42] mediator between God and man and that's
[1:02:44] the man Christ
[1:02:47] Jesus Babylon was founded by Nimrod the
[1:02:50] son of kush the son of ham the son of
[1:02:53] Noah Now watch how brother picks this
[1:02:56] out in the the seven Church age book
[1:02:59] perian Church AG Babel is the original
[1:03:03] name for
[1:03:04] Babylon it means
[1:03:07] confusion it was literally started by
[1:03:10] Kush the son of ham but was brought to a
[1:03:14] kingdom of power and Grandeur under his
[1:03:17] son Nimrod the mighty Hunter Nimrod
[1:03:20] according to Genesis 11 account and also
[1:03:24] according to profane
[1:03:26] history Nimrod set out to accomplish
[1:03:29] three things he wanted to build a strong
[1:03:32] Nation he
[1:03:34] did he wanted to propagate his own
[1:03:37] religion which he did he wanted to make
[1:03:40] a name for himself which he also
[1:03:43] accomplished his accomplishments were so
[1:03:47] Monumental that the kingdom of Babylon
[1:03:50] was called the head of gold amongst all
[1:03:53] World
[1:03:54] governments that his religion
[1:03:56] gained
[1:03:58] prominence is proven by the fact that
[1:04:01] the scripture identifies it with Satan
[1:04:04] completely in Isaiah chapter 14 and
[1:04:08] Revelation chapter 17 and 18 and by
[1:04:11] history we can prove that he invaded the
[1:04:14] whole world and is the basis for every
[1:04:17] system of
[1:04:19] idolatry Babylon is it's the
[1:04:22] basis of every form of
[1:04:27] idolatry and the theme of
[1:04:29] Mythology though the names of gods
[1:04:32] differ in various sections of the land
[1:04:34] according to the language of the
[1:04:38] people that he made a name for himself
[1:04:40] and his followers goes without
[1:04:44] saying for as long as this present age
[1:04:48] goes on until Jesus reveals himself to
[1:04:52] his Brethren he will be worshiped and
[1:04:55] honored
[1:04:56] through though under a different name
[1:04:59] from Nimrod and in a temple slightly
[1:05:02] different from the one in which was
[1:05:05] originally
[1:05:06] adored let me show you something very
[1:05:09] interesting that as I studied about
[1:05:11] babyon I want to show you in 2 Kings
[1:05:15] chapter
[1:05:17] 17 2 Kings
[1:05:20] 17 the king of Assyria commanded saying
[1:05:24] carry thither one of the priests whom
[1:05:27] you brought from th and let them go and
[1:05:30] dwell there and let him teach them the
[1:05:33] manner of the god of the land notice the
[1:05:36] god of the land not the god of
[1:05:42] heaven and one of the priests whom They
[1:05:44] Carried Away from Samaria came and dwelt
[1:05:47] in
[1:05:48] bethl and taught them how they should
[1:05:50] fear the lord how be it every nation
[1:05:53] make gods of Their Own
[1:05:56] and put them in the houses of high
[1:05:59] places which the Samaritans had made
[1:06:02] every nation in their cities wherein
[1:06:04] they dwell and the men of Babylon made
[1:06:08] suo
[1:06:10] Beno who made this the men of
[1:06:14] Babylon others made God's idolatry but
[1:06:18] the men of Babylon made suo Beno what
[1:06:22] does that mean in Hebrew let me show you
[1:06:26] it means booths of the daughters means
[1:06:31] brothel means idolatrous tents for
[1:06:35] impure purpose to commit adultery and
[1:06:38] fornication so the men of Babylon the
[1:06:41] spirit behind it suo benath means houses
[1:06:46] of
[1:06:48] fornication that's the spirit behind it
[1:06:50] why it's unclean
[1:06:56] it's adulterous it's
[1:06:59] fornicating in fact their
[1:07:02] worship was to worship the woman and to
[1:07:06] worship was to have sex with
[1:07:10] her this is what the men of Babylon
[1:07:17] started that's why the original go back
[1:07:20] to the original sin it wasn't eating an
[1:07:23] apple
[1:07:26] do you
[1:07:28] see do you see how that now the Earth
[1:07:32] all the
[1:07:34] media all the social agenda all of the
[1:07:39] Instagram
[1:07:40] Facebook Twitter whatever it's
[1:07:45] filled with things that come from this
[1:07:48] very thing of
[1:07:50] Babylon wants to seduce your minds
[1:07:58] the men brought forth from the men
[1:08:01] brought forth from
[1:08:03] Babylon idolatrous
[1:08:07] worship and it was incorporated with the
[1:08:10] worship of women through fornication and
[1:08:14] idolatry now here in America we're
[1:08:17] witnessing now let's bring bring it down

[1:11:35] world has been
[1:11:39] indument with all of this stuff it's
[1:11:44] okay it's not I want you to understand
[1:11:47] those are pagan holidays and they are
[1:11:51] coming back from Pagan worship
[1:11:55] and yet it's celebrated here in America
[1:11:57] and we think nothing about
[1:12:00] it God help us thank
[1:12:04] you Lord for sending us a prophet that
[1:12:07] told us that where Christmas come
[1:12:11] from told us where Easter comes
[1:12:14] from and said hey you know what it's
[1:12:17] Christianity
[1:12:19] versus idolatry are you listening to the
[1:12:21] same tapes I listen to
[1:12:26] and when you listen to that and then
[1:12:28] wonder how is this stuff celebrated and
[1:12:31] I want to say this the farther we get
[1:12:34] away from the time of brother Brennan
[1:12:36] preaching it among his people to years
[1:12:39] later churches now are embracing it as
[1:12:42] though it's
[1:12:45] nothing oh brother Ron you're just an
[1:12:47] old
[1:12:49] fogy you're just a a mean old guy that
[1:12:53] just won't let us have any fun it's
[1:12:56] idolatry stay away from
[1:13:06] it lot they see in church
[1:13:10] age he said now of
[1:13:13] course they are poor he said that that
[1:13:15] means they're spiritually poor sign of
[1:13:18] the age as it closes is bigger and
[1:13:21] better
[1:13:22] churches with more and more people and
[1:13:25] with more and more manifestation of what
[1:13:27] is supposed to be the demonstrations of
[1:13:29] the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost but they
[1:13:32] filled Alters watch
[1:13:34] this the gifts of the Spirit in
[1:13:37] operation the remarkable attendance is
[1:13:40] not the answer from
[1:13:42] God for those who come to the altars
[1:13:45] very seldom stay to go on with
[1:13:47] God and after the great campaigns are
[1:13:51] finished we are all those who came down
[1:13:53] the aisles
[1:13:56] they heard a man they listened to an
[1:13:58] appeal they came into the net but they
[1:14:01] were not
[1:14:03] fish and turtle likee they crawled back
[1:14:06] to their own
[1:14:09] Waters what is a denomination let me ask
[1:14:11] you this what is a denomination here's
[1:14:15] what Webster said denomination a large
[1:14:19] group of religious
[1:14:21] congregations United under a common
[1:14:23] faith and name and organized under a
[1:14:26] single Administration and legal
[1:14:30] hierarchy let me paraphrase it when a
[1:14:32] group of people take the leadership of
[1:14:34] man over the leadership of God they've
[1:14:38] denominated making private
[1:14:40] interpretations of the word and turning
[1:14:42] the word of God into fables Creeds and
[1:14:44] dogmas now brother brandham put this
[1:14:50] prophecy on the cornerstone of Brenham
[1:14:52] Tabernacle
[1:14:55] make
[1:14:56] full make Proof full proof of thy
[1:15:01] Ministry for the time will
[1:15:04] come when they will not endure sound
[1:15:07] Doctrine but
[1:15:09] shall reap and Heap up
[1:15:12] fables and
[1:15:18] doctrines yeah Lord help
[1:15:22] us you would think that the brandom
[1:15:24] Tabernacle today would be probably the
[1:15:26] most thriving
[1:15:28] biggest church in
[1:15:32] America go there go there and visit
[1:15:36] sometime it's a
[1:15:41] museum my heart broke I walked through
[1:15:46] as I walked through the front and of
[1:15:48] course they don't want you to get up and
[1:15:50] get behind the
[1:15:51] pulpit that you know just this this IM
[1:15:54] me don't touch these things so we walked
[1:15:58] in
[1:15:59] and I looked at the pulpit and it's
[1:16:01] empty there's no one there there's no
[1:16:04] one in the
[1:16:06] congregation The Voice is
[1:16:10] not here the very
[1:16:15] Cornerstone of this
[1:16:17] message they've silence to the
[1:16:20] voice they've closed the doors and even
[1:16:24] if you have a prayer meeting you can't
[1:16:27] even pray out
[1:16:29] loud and you have to get online to say
[1:16:31] what time you're going to go there to
[1:16:34] pray I say it's
[1:16:38] nonsense something inside of me is
[1:16:40] rising up against it and say it wasn't
[1:16:42] no Catholic Church that's going to close
[1:16:45] your
[1:16:46] doors it's a Catholic
[1:16:49] spirit and you're going to worship a man
[1:16:51] and he's going to tell you what tape to
[1:16:53] listen to and where how to do it and
[1:16:54] when and
[1:16:55] everybody
[1:16:57] nonsense you listen to those tapes at
[1:17:00] home and you read your Bible and pray
[1:17:03] that when you come to this church if I'm
[1:17:05] saying something that is contrary to
[1:17:08] this message or your Bible get away from
[1:17:15] it amen

[1:17:32] democracy theocracy is a government
[1:17:36] government ruled by or subject to
[1:17:39] religious
[1:17:42] Authority democracy is not God's way of
[1:17:45] leadership that's

[1:18:36] is they're getting what they've asked
[1:18:38] for and they're going to get it that's
[1:18:40] all no they won't believe it no
[1:18:44] sir they let you know that they're
[1:18:47] American citizens and they got a right
[1:18:48] to function any way they want
[1:18:53] to let me
[1:18:55] tell you I'll tell you now no sir
[1:18:59] politics will never work no sir
[1:19:02] democracy will never work democracy is
[1:19:05] rotten to the
[1:19:07] Bone if it could be run among a bunch of
[1:19:10] Christians it'd be fine but when you put
[1:19:12] it out there in the world it becomes all
[1:19:16] sails and no anchor exactly right look
[1:19:19] at here today anything can take place
[1:19:22] and they'll just anything pull a few
[1:19:25] politics and get away with
[1:19:30] murder look at this Prophet looking at
[1:19:34] the symptoms of
[1:19:40] America democracy is a rule by
[1:19:43] majority that's not God's rule God Rules
[1:19:47] by one king or queen is that right a
[1:19:51] monarchy
[1:19:56] that's called a
[1:20:01] theocracy
[1:20:03] Anarchy is no rulership recognized at
[1:20:07] all so take away and have no
[1:20:10] rulership Democratic or Theocratic you
[1:20:14] have
[1:20:15] Anarchy that means anything
[1:20:18] goes and then you have communism which
[1:20:22] is a theoretical e e omic system
[1:20:25] characterized by the collective
[1:20:27] ownership of property and by the
[1:20:30] organization of labor for the common
[1:20:32] advantage of all members sounds good
[1:20:35] brother Brenham they even asked brother
[1:20:37] Brenham what about in in the book of
[1:20:39] Acts where they put all their stuff
[1:20:41] together and they all lived as one and
[1:20:44] they gave to those who had little and
[1:20:46] etc etc he said it won't work today how
[1:20:49] many of you know that he said otherwise
[1:20:52] now that's what they did a giving an
[1:20:54] example in
[1:20:56] Prescott so everybody that lived in the
[1:21:00] Prescot Church in that little trailer
[1:21:03] park they all worked for the same
[1:21:06] company and they pulled all their money
[1:21:08] and the head of that group got to pay
[1:21:10] the brothers well I'll give you so much
[1:21:12] cuz you don't have a big family in fact
[1:21:14] you're not even married so I'm going to
[1:21:15] give you so much money so you weren't
[1:21:17] getting paid by the hour you were
[1:21:19] getting paid all the money got given to
[1:21:21] him and then he passed it out now
[1:21:24] understand
[1:21:26] I think next week we might start our own
[1:21:29] company and all of you can work for me
[1:21:30] and all the money comes to me and I'll
[1:21:32] give it to you guys as I think you need
[1:21:35] it I would hope some of you go n n sorry
[1:21:40] a
[1:21:43] wrong and
[1:21:45] yet brother renham said what they did
[1:21:49] then the book of Acts will not work
[1:21:50] again for
[1:21:52] today fact Paul said the a man who
[1:21:55] doesn't
[1:21:56] work he don't
[1:21:58] eat boy there' be a lot of people on
[1:22:01] this intermittent
[1:22:07] fasting
[1:22:10] anyway even within the
[1:22:12] message you have different ones who do
[1:22:15] not believe in going to
[1:22:17] church or even having a home
[1:22:21] Church they don't know the difference
[1:22:23] between organ organized
[1:22:26] religion and a church that's been set in
[1:22:30] order do you hear the
[1:22:33] difference they don't know the
[1:22:35] difference between organized
[1:22:38] religion and a church that's been set in
[1:22:40] order brother Brenham said you watch the
[1:22:42] gifts of the Spirit if they're not set
[1:22:45] in order and used correctly do more
[1:22:48] damage to the church then they do good
[1:22:55] even says that ministers have invaded
[1:22:57] the pulpit without a call of God on
[1:22:59] their
[1:23:04] life oh
[1:23:08] god brother Brenham said the church in
[1:23:10] order he didn't organize
[1:23:14] it no he was against organizing
[1:23:18] churches watch
[1:23:21] this we would see Jesus 1961
[1:23:25] well you see Mr Brandon we're not
[1:23:27] supposed to argue the word I said I'm
[1:23:29] not arguing the word I'm just asking you
[1:23:32] I've got hops Two Babylons I've got
[1:23:34] ancient histories that I can find here's
[1:23:37] the Nan fathers Nan Council pre nine
[1:23:40] Council all right right here in my study
[1:23:43] show me anywhere there was a Catholic
[1:23:46] church till 3005 show me where it was he
[1:23:50] said you're quoting history I said how
[1:23:53] do I know there was a George Washington
[1:23:54] here only by history show me something
[1:23:58] different see I said that's exactly
[1:24:00] right God never did organize a church it
[1:24:04] never was God's plan to do it
[1:24:07] organizations mother church it's
[1:24:10] Catholic and all the rest of them is off
[1:24:13] of that same organization according to
[1:24:15] Revelation 17 that's exactly right
[1:24:19] breaking down Fellowship now watch this
[1:24:21] when a denominational spirit
[1:24:25] gets among the people of the message it
[1:24:28] destroys Fellowship one with
[1:24:32] another it
[1:24:35] does brother Bram said this message will
[1:24:38] never
[1:24:40] denominate the but some of the people
[1:24:42] already
[1:24:45] have yeah the message can't because the
[1:24:47] message is
[1:24:53] Christ God God help us to have our eyes
[1:24:58] open to what's
[1:25:00] happening then we got all these private
[1:25:03] interpretations about you know well he
[1:25:06] said this but he meant that and next
[1:25:08] thing you know we got a little group and
[1:25:09] they pull off that little group and to
[1:25:11] show you how bad it gets so they follow
[1:25:14] a man that man can pull a group of
[1:25:16] people away from the message they can
[1:25:18] all follow him and he dies and goes off
[1:25:21] the scene and they still play his tapes
[1:25:24] yeah go
[1:25:28] figure it's
[1:25:36] happening Daniel Andes took me through
[1:25:39] Jeffersonville and he says have you ever
[1:25:41] seen Don rutles church I said no sir you
[1:25:45] want to go see it
[1:25:47] yeah he said you want to see Junior
[1:25:49] Jackson's Church
[1:25:52] yeah have any of you seen you know have
[1:25:54] any of you been brother Steve you have
[1:25:56] anybody
[1:25:58] else they're not big churches are they
[1:26:00] Martin how many people are in
[1:26:05] them it's a handful and there a bunch of
[1:26:08] old gray-haired
[1:26:09] people going in there the kids are
[1:26:13] saying this is
[1:26:16] nonsense
[1:26:17] and do they preach no they play the
[1:26:20] tapes of Don ruddle or Junior Jackson
[1:26:24] saints of God I will come back from the
[1:26:27] grave and haunt
[1:26:31] you if God takes me off of the scene and
[1:26:34] you play my
[1:26:36] tapes I
[1:26:42] will cuz I don't want you to follow
[1:26:45] me you follow Christ you follow the
[1:26:49] Bible you follow God's word quit
[1:26:52] following the leadership of man yes God
[1:26:54] uses
[1:26:56] man but it's not the leadership of man
[1:26:59] brother Brenham said I believe in I
[1:27:00] believe in God filled God ordained God
[1:27:03] sent men who are equipped with the word
[1:27:06] so you're not following the man you're
[1:27:09] following
[1:27:10] God he still uses man I pray I'm one of
[1:27:21] them amen
[1:27:24] Fellowship is always hindered when you
[1:27:27] have your interpretation goes against my
[1:27:31] interpretation next thing you know we
[1:27:32] can't have
[1:27:36] fellowship if we will say what the word
[1:27:38] of God says or what the message says how
[1:27:40] can we just Fellowship one
[1:27:43] another how can
[1:27:47] we just say what he says well it means
[1:27:50] this it means
[1:27:52] that somebody sent me
[1:27:54] a clip of Donnie Reagan
[1:28:01] preaching little
[1:28:04] clip So I listened to it I listened to
[1:28:07] it last
[1:28:10] night talked about
[1:28:13] gono
[1:28:15] yes it took an Apache to catch an
[1:28:19] Apache because the white man could not
[1:28:21] follow the Apache no matter where he
[1:28:23] went through the the mountains over here
[1:28:26] in
[1:28:28] Arizona so they got some other Apaches
[1:28:32] who followed the white man next thing
[1:28:34] you know they caught gonal put him in a
[1:28:37] train put them all of them in
[1:28:40] there and the different ones with their
[1:28:43] different ideas trying to paraphrase it
[1:28:46] right now and they started
[1:28:49] fighting excuse me in the Box
[1:28:52] Car drawn Mo stood up and he said stop
[1:28:57] fighting
[1:28:58] yourselves there's so few of us
[1:29:02] left let's stick
[1:29:05] together I feel like that in the message

[1:29:09] kidding me our papers are saying you're
[1:29:12] are a cult you're this and that you

[1:29:29] be perfecting her is what perfect

[1:30:48] it I believe to be the servant of the
[1:30:50] Lord God and after the great striking
[1:30:53] things that I've said about the end time
[1:30:56] remember Jesus promised to appear here
[1:30:59] at the end time the Gentile
[1:31:03] age and so the same thing as he did when
[1:31:06] he represented himself to the
[1:31:08] Jews how' he do it by Discerning their
[1:31:12] thoughts and telling them where they'd
[1:31:15] been and tell all such
[1:31:17] things that was the last sign before the
[1:31:20] destruction and here it is again tonight
[1:31:24] the same Holy Spirit the same Jesus in
[1:31:29] the form of the holy spirit with his
[1:31:31] picture taken the pillar of
[1:31:33] fire every scientific thing like it was
[1:31:38] in those days in Babylon here it is
[1:31:41] right back again tonight we're at the
[1:31:43] end time he knows all about you do you

[1:31:50] trust in this nation do not put your
[1:31:54] trust in president

[1:32:00] put your trust in our
[1:32:03] government put your trust in
[1:32:08] God let me show you very quickly here
[1:32:11] before I bring this to a
[1:32:15] close the same issues that Daniel faced
[1:32:19] in the time of being captured by Babylon
[1:32:24] I want you to see it from the scripture
[1:32:26] so I'd like you to turn with me in your
[1:32:28] Bibles to Daniel chap
[1:32:37] 4 Daniel chapter 4 verse
[1:32:40] 29 through
[1:32:43] 37 at the end of 12 months he walked in
[1:32:47] the Palace of the kingdom of
[1:32:51] Babylon then the king spake who is he
[1:32:54] who is the king at that time
[1:32:56] Nebuchadnezzar and the King spake and
[1:32:58] said is not this great babyon that I
[1:33:03] have built from the house of the Kingdom
[1:33:06] by the might of my power and for the
[1:33:09] honor of my
[1:33:11] Majesty sounds like somebody else that's
[1:33:13] so narcistic that everything look what I
[1:33:15] done I did this I did that I I
[1:33:19] I that's why be careful
[1:33:24] and while the word was in the king's
[1:33:25] mouth there fell a voice from Heaven
[1:33:27] saying oh King Nebuchadnezzar to thee it
[1:33:29] is
[1:33:30] spoken the kingdom is departed from
[1:33:35] thee and they shall Drive thee from men
[1:33:38] and thy dwelling shall be with the
[1:33:40] beasts of the field they shall make thee
[1:33:43] to eat grass as oxen and seven times
[1:33:46] shall pass over thee until thou know
[1:33:50] that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom
[1:33:52] of men and giveth
[1:33:54] it to whomsoever he will look at that
[1:33:58] seven seasons will pass until you know
[1:34:01] the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of
[1:34:04] men the same hour the thing was
[1:34:07] fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was
[1:34:09] driven from men and did eat grass as
[1:34:11] oxen and his body was wet with the Dew
[1:34:13] of the Heaven till his hairs were grown
[1:34:16] out like eagle feathers and his nails
[1:34:18] were like Bird's
[1:34:20] Claws and at the end of the days in
[1:34:22] other words that's prophecy Seven
[1:34:26] Seasons at the end of the days I
[1:34:29] Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto
[1:34:32] heaven and my understanding returned
[1:34:35] unto me and I blessed the most high and
[1:34:38] I praised and honor honored him that
[1:34:41] liveth
[1:34:42] forever whose Dominion is an everlasting
[1:34:45] dominion and his kingdom is from
[1:34:48] generation to Generation Now I want to
[1:34:50] ask you is he doing this because he's
[1:34:52] got divine Revelation is this some kind
[1:34:55] of divine Epiphany oh God no it's cuz
[1:35:00] God humbled him made him eat like an ox
[1:35:04] amen until the time had passed and then
[1:35:06] his mind returned to him look at
[1:35:11] this 35 and all the inhabitants of the
[1:35:13] Earth are reputed as nothing and he
[1:35:16] doeth according to his will in the army
[1:35:18] of heaven and among the inhabitants of
[1:35:21] the earth and none can stay his hand and
[1:35:23] say
[1:35:24] unto him what doest thou at the same
[1:35:27] time my reason returned unto
[1:35:29] me and for the glory of my kingdom my
[1:35:33] honor and my brightness returned unto me
[1:35:36] my counselors and my lords sought out me
[1:35:40] and I was established in my kingdom and
[1:35:42] excellent Majesty was added unto me now
[1:35:46] I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and
[1:35:48] honor the king of Heaven all whose works
[1:35:51] are truth and his ways judgment
[1:35:54] and those that walk in Pride he is able
[1:35:57] to abase so he's saying this CU you know
[1:36:00] what he was
[1:36:05] humbled oh look at this great Kingdom
[1:36:08] Babylon look at this Kingdom I have done
[1:36:11] this and I have built it and it's so
[1:36:13] great look at the glory of
[1:36:16] Babylon and God humbled
[1:36:19] him hey God can humble you real quick
[1:36:22] too you think you've built something up
[1:36:24] you think this is all you know look at
[1:36:26] me look at what I've done
[1:36:29] hey you better you see when he was
[1:36:32] saying these things and he was saying oh
[1:36:34] he's the god of heaven and this and that
[1:36:36] he's not saying it by Revelation he's
[1:36:39] saying it
[1:36:40] because God humbled him do you know
[1:36:44] that at the at the end
[1:36:47] time that every knee shall bow and every
[1:36:50] tongue confess that he's God I'm going
[1:36:53] to ask you is that divine
[1:36:56] revelation it's just an admitting he's
[1:37:00] God even the Devils would admit he's God
[1:37:04] Pharaoh his Moses God is
[1:37:09] God so all of this stuff that just like
[1:37:13] Nebuchadnezzar and I'm going to show you
[1:37:15] in the scriptures in the next sermon or
[1:37:18] two did you take
[1:37:21] manasse one of the tribes
[1:37:25] and how he did so evil in the sight of
[1:37:27] the Lord more evil than all but and
[1:37:30] caused all of Israel to depart and did
[1:37:33] Evil and so and so but at the end of his
[1:37:36] days I'm going to show you in
[1:37:39] Scripture that he had an Affliction come
[1:37:41] upon him and he got very sick and he
[1:37:44] turned his face towards
[1:37:47] God because of his Affliction and the
[1:37:49] Bible says and God intreated him
[1:37:56] and God allowed him to come back now you
[1:38:00] would have thought that all the horrible
[1:38:02] things he did caused Israel to go so far
[1:38:06] off worse than all the others and yet
[1:38:09] God the Bible says and he did all these
[1:38:13] things before God humbled
[1:38:20] him he came back he's going to to be one
[1:38:23] of the
[1:38:25] tribes I want you to talk about
[1:38:28] predestination I want you to think about
[1:38:29] it for just a second predestinated
[1:38:33] manasse did more evil than all the
[1:38:37] others and caused them all to go wrong
[1:38:39] and
[1:38:40] yet he's going to be there how did God
[1:38:44] do it there was an Affliction putting on
[1:38:47] turned his face towards God and the
[1:38:49] Bible says and God entreated
[1:38:51] him and he did all the this unto him
[1:38:54] before he was humbled and after he was
[1:38:57] humbled he came and he tore down those
[1:39:00] places he had built up he took down the
[1:39:02] altars and he he destroyed all of that
[1:39:07] stuff and yet it says after he died and
[1:39:10] watch his the next king that comes on
[1:39:12] his son and he he did evil in the sight
[1:39:15] of the Lord even as his father had done
[1:39:18] even though we teach our
[1:39:21] kids sometimes what we have soed in our
[1:39:24] youth comes back to haunt us in our old
[1:39:27] age oh God help
[1:39:30] us bring our children up and nurture and
[1:39:34] admonition of the
[1:39:39] Lord Daniel chapter
[1:39:42] 5 we'll use this this will be our
[1:39:48] closing may I ask you brother Mark my
[1:39:52] voice is a little rough right now would
[1:39:54] you read Daniel chapter 5 I'll give you
[1:39:58] a moment to find Daniel 5 and verses 18
[1:40:02] through
[1:40:06] 31 while he's turning to that there's a
[1:40:10] quote I want to show you brother R said
[1:40:12] in raising gyrus
[1:40:15] daughter Brethren go ahead you
[1:40:20] know oh how wonderful
[1:40:23] then this Maniac run down to and the
[1:40:26] Lord Jesus rebuked them spirits and a
[1:40:28] lot of people say that religion will run
[1:40:31] you crazy not the religion of the Lord
[1:40:34] Jesus Christ won't it'll give you your
[1:40:37] right
[1:40:38] mind and you're not in your right mind
[1:40:41] until you have met the Lord
[1:40:44] Jesus look at that isn't that amazing he
[1:40:47] said you're not even in your right mind
[1:40:49] till you met the Lord
[1:40:51] Jesus he said maybe the 250lb man of
