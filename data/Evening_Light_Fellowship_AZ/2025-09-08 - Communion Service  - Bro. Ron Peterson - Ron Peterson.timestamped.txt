[13:48] Brother Amos, would you come tonight to
[13:50] take us to the Lord in prayer?
[13:53] A praise report. I believe it's from
[13:54] brother Joel Mukabay. He said, "I would
[13:56] like to thank brother Ron and the Lord
[13:59] after brother Ron prayed for us on
[14:01] Sunday
[14:03] asking the Lord to grant us a work
[14:04] permit. It was granted last Thursday."
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, praise the Lord. Pray the Lord
[14:10] just continue to be with him. Amen.
[14:12] Brother Sean, Sister Janet are on their
[14:14] way home. Praise the Lord. Please pray
[14:17] for traveling mercy. So let's remember
[14:19] the Garveys as they would travel. It' be
[14:21] good to have them back home again. And
[14:26] Amen. We want to
[14:29] continue to pray for Sister Janet
[14:31] Brander. She fell last night and hurt
[14:34] her knee and her wrist. Her body is very
[14:36] sore and she is at home resting tonight.
[14:39] Thank you Lord for watching over her. It
[14:41] could have been much worse. So let's
[14:43] pray for Sister Jan Brander. I pray the
[14:46] Lord continue to be with her. Amen.
[14:47] Brother Amos, if you would take us to
[14:49] the Lord in prayer. If you have a need
[14:50] tonight, if you just want to lift that
[14:51] up before the Lord in prayer. God bless
[14:53] you.
[14:55] Amen. The Lord's so mindful, huh? You
[14:58] know, I was just walking up here and I
[15:00] was looking at Jonathan. I go, man, I
[15:02] keep wanting to ask him, when are
[15:03] brother, brother Shawn and Sister Janet
[15:05] coming back?
[15:08] &gt;&gt; You know that when one of us is missing,
[15:11] you don't think you're missed.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; But there's a miss. there's something
[15:15] missing. You know, part of the family's
[15:16] not there. That's right.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; And I pray that the Lord was with them
[15:19] this whole time. And I'm so thankful
[15:21] they're coming back. I look forward to
[15:22] seeing them. But let's go ahead and
[15:24] pray.
[15:26] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we just come
[15:28] humbly before your throne, Lord,
[15:30] tonight. Lord, you said to your
[15:33] disciples one day, "Except you eat of my
[15:35] flesh and drink of my blood, you have no
[15:36] part with me, Lord." And Lord, those
[15:39] words ring true today, Lord. That's why
[15:41] we're gathered here tonight, Lord.
[15:43] Because we're here to eat of your flesh
[15:45] and drink of your blood, Lord. Lord,
[15:48] we're so thankful for that blood, Lord.
[15:50] Because without blood, there's no
[15:52] remission of sins, Lord. And Lord, we we
[15:55] thank you for that blood. We It
[15:57] sanctifies us, Lord. Now, help us do
[15:59] like our pastor said this morning, and
[16:01] sanctify ourselves.
[16:03] Help us to take the scripture, the word,
[16:05] and apply it to our life, Lord. Help us
[16:09] to not look at others, Lord, but to look
[16:11] from within the enemy from within, Lord,
[16:14] that's trying to take us down, Lord. I
[16:16] pray that you would through the washing
[16:18] of the water of the word, Lord. May the
[16:20] bars of just things that hold us so
[16:24] easily, beset us, just be taken down,
[16:26] Lord, and smashed. And Lord, help us to
[16:30] wash your feet tonight, Lord. And for
[16:33] Jesus had dirty feet one day. And and
[16:36] just like the woman at the well, like
[16:37] our pastor said this morning, surely
[16:39] they would have said if you knew what
[16:41] she what kind of life she lives, you
[16:43] wouldn't let her draw water for you.
[16:47] But yet, Lord, you know all things. You
[16:49] search the reigns of the hearts, Lord.
[16:51] And we're gathered here tonight, Lord.
[16:53] Each one of us representing what you've
[16:55] done in our lives, Lord. And we're here
[16:57] to give back to you, Lord, according to
[16:59] everything that we can do. And now these
[17:01] needs, Lord, Sister Janet, Lord, uh,
[17:04] fell, Lord, and hurt herself, Father.
[17:06] These bodies are so feeble and weak,
[17:08] Lord. And we need you, Lord. I pray that
[17:10] you would come on the scene for her.
[17:12] Touch her, Lord, and lift her up, Lord,
[17:14] that she might. She's such a faithful
[17:16] soldier of the cross, Lord. I pray that
[17:18] you would be with her, Father. Restore
[17:20] unto us all things, Lord. Lord, we just
[17:24] love you. We We thank you for this time
[17:26] tonight. We pray that you would just be
[17:28] with us, Lord. May you be glorified in
[17:30] everything that we do and say. Be with
[17:32] those who couldn't be with us tonight,
[17:33] Lord. And be with those that are
[17:35] streaming, Lord. We just love you. We
[17:37] ask you these precious things in the
[17:39] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Amos. You may be
[17:44] seated tonight. I'm going to be looking
[17:47] forward to our communion, our
[17:48] footwashing service this evening. Amen.
[17:51] God is good. Amen. I was thinking of the
[17:53] song today. There's going to be a
[17:54] meeting in the air. The sweet, sweet by
[17:57] and by.
[18:00] You have heard of little Moses in the
[18:04] bull rush. And you have heard of
[18:07] fearless David and his slain.
[18:11] You have heard the story told of
[18:14] grieving Joseph
[18:17] and of Jonah and the whale you often
[18:20] sing.
[18:22] And there are many, many others in the
[18:25] Bible.
[18:27] I should like to meet them all. I do
[18:30] declare
[18:33] by and by the Lord will surely let us
[18:36] meet them
[18:38] at that meeting in the air.
[18:43] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[18:48] the air in the sweet sweet and by.
[18:54] I am going to meet you, meet you over
[18:59] there in that home beyond the sky.
[19:05] Such singing you will hear, heard by
[19:09] mortal will be glorious, I do declare.
[19:16] And God's own son will be the leading
[19:20] one at that meeting in the air.
[19:26] Many things will there be missing at
[19:29] that meeting.
[19:32] For the mourers's bench will have no
[19:34] place at all.
[19:37] And there will never be a servant
[19:40] preached to sinners.
[19:42] For the sinner had refused to heed the
[19:46] call.
[19:47] And there will be no mourning over
[19:50] weward loved ones.
[19:53] There will be no lonely nights of
[19:56] pleading prayer.
[19:58] All our burdens and our anguish will be
[20:02] lifted
[20:04] at that meeting in the air.
[20:09] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[20:13] the air in the sweet, sweet by and by.
[20:19] And I am going to meet you, meet you
[20:23] over there in that home beyond the sky.
[20:30] Such singing you will hear, never heard
[20:34] by mortal ear, will be glorious. I do
[20:38] declare
[20:40] and God's own son will be the leading
[20:45] one at that meeting in the air.
[20:51] There the doubters will be missing all
[20:54] together.
[20:56] All the skeptics will be absent on that
[21:00] day.
[21:02] There will be no rumblers present to
[21:05] disturb us.
[21:08] We'll be busy far away.
[21:12] There the saints will have his seal upon
[21:15] their foreheads.
[21:17] Dressed in Raymond, but ransom ones can
[21:21] wear.
[21:22] All who have that wedding garment will
[21:25] be present
[21:28] at that meeting in the air.
[21:33] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[21:37] the air in the sweet sweet by and by.
[21:43] And I am going to meet you, meet you
[21:47] over there in that home beyond the sky.
[21:54] Such singing you will hear. Never heard
[21:58] by mortal ear will be glorious. I do
[22:02] declare
[22:04] and God's own son will be the leading
[22:09] one at that meeting in the air.
[22:14] [Music]

[35:37] The praise of your glory.
[35:41] For you are raised to life
[35:46] again.
[35:48] You have no rival.
[35:52] You have no equal.
[35:56] Now and forever.
[35:59] God, you reign
[36:03] and yours is the kingom.
[36:07] Yours is the glory.
[36:11] Yours is the name
[36:14] above all name.

[37:10] Nothing compares to this.

[40:43] to worship
[40:48] you,
[40:50] oh my soul,
[40:53] [Music]
[40:54] rejoice.
[40:55] [Music]
[40:58] Take joy my king
[41:05] in
[41:06] what you hear.
[41:10] [Music]
[41:12] Oh, may it be a sweet,
[41:16] sweet
[41:18] sound
[41:20] in your ear.
[41:25] [Music]
[41:27] Amen. Amen. Thank you. God bless you.
[41:30] Let's just remain standing. Thank you
[41:32] musicians each and everyone. It's good
[41:35] to be in the house of the Lord this
[41:37] evening. Here we are on communion and
[41:40] footwashing.
[41:42] It is a very important time.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I give you these three
[41:47] ordinances for you to do, not three
[41:49] suggestions.
[41:52] Amen.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Three ordinances that you keep until I
[41:57] come.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; So it's important because what you do is
[42:00] you come here and you judge yourself.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; And so it's very important um to come
[42:08] and partake of communion and
[42:10] footwashing.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. First Thessalonians 5 vers 18
[42:16] through 24.
[42:18] Amen. Uh, brother Mark, I think I've
[42:21] asked you if you would First
[42:24] Thessalonians 5
[42:27] verse 18- 24.
[42:32] In everything give thanks, for this is
[42:34] the will of God in Christ Jesus
[42:36] concerning you. Quench not the spirit.
[42:40] Despise not prophesyings.
[42:42] Prove all things. Hold fast that which
[42:44] is good. Abstain from all appearance of
[42:47] evil. Now notice verse 23, very
[42:50] important.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you
[42:53] holy.
[42:55] And I pray God your whole spirit and
[42:57] soul and body be preserved blameless
[43:00] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
[43:02] Christ.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Faithful is he that calleth you who also
[43:06] will do it.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless the reading of his
[43:09] word. You may be seated this evening in
[43:12] God's presence. Praise the Lord. So glad
[43:15] to see you all out here to our communion
[43:19] and service uh this evening. Now, uh did
[43:24] some of you get these uh little graphs?
[43:28] And I I think uh Steve McNeely told me
[43:31] said Martin Malumba went and he just
[43:34] went over and took a picture of each one
[43:35] of them. I thought, why didn't I think
[43:37] of that? Why in the world he have to,
[43:39] you know? But anyway, uh that way you
[43:41] can keep it. you can print it out and
[43:43] you can give it to somebody else and and
[43:45] everything. Um, and so we'll just be
[43:48] touching a little bit more uh this
[43:51] evening on this uh and we're going in
[43:55] the direction of uh that uh may God
[43:59] sanctify you holy.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; That's not hol y but w h o l l y. In
[44:07] other words, in totality.
[44:10] I want to both your body, your spirit
[44:15] and your soul. Now when you understand
[44:18] the message and you begin to see the
[44:20] unfolding of the word even to the
[44:22] prophet of God
[44:25] uh throughout his life as a young
[44:29] Baptist minister, one of the first times
[44:31] that he goes to a Pentecostal meeting in
[44:35] I think it was in Mishawaka
[44:38] and he was there and boy he saw things
[44:41] that he had never seen before. people
[44:43] all excited and they were jumping and
[44:46] shouting. They were speaking in tongues
[44:48] and interpretations of tongues and my he
[44:52] just saw things that he had never seen
[44:54] before. He says there I I uh I said,
[44:58] "Wow." One of the guys says, "Have you
[45:00] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost?" He
[45:02] said, "Well, I ain't got what you got."
[45:04] And uh he you know so anyway as you all
[45:08] know in brother Brandham's life story he
[45:10] said there I uh now you all know he has
[45:14] a supernatural gift in his hand
[45:16] &gt;&gt; right
[45:17] &gt;&gt; he said when I shake somebody's hand
[45:19] that I would know I would just be able
[45:21] to discern
[45:23] and um so um in fact brother Billy Paul
[45:28] told me that he said uh Billy
[45:32] brother Brennham had told him he said
[45:34] Billy
[45:35] I wish I didn't have this gift,
[45:38] &gt;&gt; not in my hand.
[45:40] He said, "It's so hard for me because
[45:42] people tell you with their face and with
[45:44] their lips, "Oh, we love you, Brother
[45:47] Brennham. Oh, we enjoy your ministry."
[45:50] And he said, "I shake their hand and I
[45:51] know they don't."
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be tough for you?
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so he said, "I kind of wish I
[45:59] didn't know those things." And yet God
[46:01] supernaturally allowed him to have that
[46:03] gift. So he's there moving in the spirit
[46:06] and there's one man stands up and he
[46:08] speaks in tongues and another one uh he
[46:12] interprets it and boy he says, "Oh, I
[46:15] must be among angels." He said, "This is
[46:18] amazing. I just am excited." You know,
[46:22] and he says, "I just couldn't wait to
[46:24] go." And he said, "I mingled around
[46:26] until I met the man that got up and
[46:28] spoke in tongues." And and um he said,
[46:33] "Uh my he was just true blue. He was
[46:36] just as pure a Christian, loved the
[46:38] Lord." He said uh and he says, "Then I
[46:41] made my way around and I met the man who
[46:44] interpreted."
[46:46] And he said, I shook his hand. He said,
[46:48] "What a hypocrite."
[46:50] He said, "This man uh uh you know was
[46:55] had a blond-haired wife and or black
[46:58] dark-haired wife and had children by a
[47:00] blondhaired woman and so on and so
[47:02] forth." And now Brother Brennan is very
[47:04] confused.
[47:07] Brother Brenham is asking God, "God, I
[47:10] don't understand this. This is I thought
[47:13] I was among angels.
[47:16] No, what is this? Am I among devils?
[47:19] what is the situation going on? So,
[47:22] brother Brennham, as you know, as a
[47:24] being a man of God, what he does is he
[47:26] goes and he prays. He gets alone and
[47:29] Elijah his prayer closet was always to
[47:31] get out, get alone, and he was out in
[47:33] the cave uh as you know, and he's
[47:35] seeking the mind of the Lord concerning
[47:38] this situation and everything because
[47:41] now this has troubled him. How is it
[47:43] that this genuine Holy Spirit and I felt
[47:47] it and I bore witness of it that the
[47:50] genuine Holy Spirit was falling on these
[47:54] people and yet one is a hypocrite and
[47:58] another one is a true blue Christian.
[48:01] And so uh he says I was out there and I
[48:04] had been studying in my Bible. I had my
[48:07] Bible laying across the log and I come
[48:10] out and and he says and and uh I was
[48:13] just kind of meditating and the wind
[48:15] blew the pages.
[48:19] He said, "But that's not where I was
[48:21] studying." He brings it back and the
[48:22] wind blows it again.
[48:26] And he and now now watch a man of God.
[48:29] He said, "I know that's for a purpose."
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Even the blowing of the
[48:35] pages of my Bible," he said, 'Lord, are
[48:38] you trying to show me something? In the
[48:39] rain that falls off upon both the just
[48:41] and the unjust, does not the cockab
[48:44] raise up with the weed? And both of them
[48:46] praise God. And so now, Brother Brennham
[48:48] is beginning to understand the anointed
[48:51] ones at the end time
[48:54] &gt;&gt; now. Now, when brother Brandon preaches
[48:55] and he talks about the false anointed
[48:57] ones at the end time, as a young
[49:00] Christian, I thought it was false
[49:01] anointing
[49:03] on even wrong seed. And when you listen
[49:07] to the sermon, no, it's a genuine Holy
[49:10] Spirit falling upon both seed and nonse.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a little bit hard for us to
[49:18] understand because, you know, if I were
[49:20] God, I would have it just cut and dried.
[49:23] It's just falls on. You know what I'm
[49:24] saying? And but you know what? God who
[49:27] is very gracious.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; He would that all men
[49:37] &gt;&gt; come to repentance.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; His blessings fall upon the just and the
[49:42] unjust.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; And how that he pours out his blessings
[49:48] upon all.
[49:50] And so uh he then begins to actually
[49:54] understand you can be anointed with the
[49:57] Holy Ghost. Listen to this because this
[49:59] is his teaching. And there's many quotes
[50:02] on this and I'm not here to show you all
[50:04] those quotes tonight. He said you can
[50:06] have the Holy Ghost 24 hours a day and
[50:09] your soul on its way to hell.
[50:12] He says because it's only upon either
[50:15] your body or your spirit. It hasn't come
[50:18] to the control tower. That's right.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Hasn't come in and taken place where God
[50:24] is Lord of your life. Jesus said, "Many
[50:27] will say unto me in that day,"Lord,
[50:29] Lord, have we not prophesy?
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Have not we cast out devils, done one uh
[50:36] wonderful works in thy name?" And Jesus
[50:39] will say
[50:40] unto them, "Depart from me, you workers
[50:43] of iniquity. I never knew you." The word
[50:46] know is genosis which means I never
[50:49] conceived you.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; So you can do all of these works. You
[50:54] can prophesy. You can understand all the
[50:56] mysteries.
[50:58] You can give your body to be burned.
[51:01] You can do all even as we see in first
[51:04] Corinthians there and have not love
[51:06] because God is love.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; You can do all these things and you can
[51:11] be activated. You can have the Holy
[51:13] Spirit activating gifts of the spirit
[51:19] and yet the control room is still God is
[51:23] not sitting on the throne.
[51:26] So that's uh a very very important thing
[51:30] to understand because when you see even
[51:33] in this end time message ministers
[51:38] and they preach and sometimes there's
[51:40] great anointings, great emotions, great
[51:43] sensations and screamings and and shout
[51:47] and I'm not against that at all. I I I
[51:50] believe in getting excited. I believe in
[51:53] being quickened. But sometimes, brother
[51:55] Brennham says, "I'm afraid what we do is
[51:57] we get one another's spirit."
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; And not the Holy Spirit.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "Watch." He said, "If the
[52:04] pastor is kind of fanatical and he bo,
[52:07] excuse me, he bobs his head in a certain
[52:09] way," he said, "they'll do the same
[52:11] thing."
[52:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "If another is starchy and he
[52:14] just get gets up there and and he just
[52:17] teaches and it's cut and dried and
[52:19] there's no amen, no nothing." and he
[52:21] said that the and and he's quite dry
[52:24] himself. The congregation will be that
[52:26] way. Now, I don't want any of you to be
[52:31] either too emotional or not emotional at
[52:34] all.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; I want all of us to be right in the
[52:37] middle of the road.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I pray that uh you will have a
[52:42] balanced walk in Jesus Christ.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, now, uh, brother Mark, and I
[52:51] think I gave it to the brethren here.
[52:53] We'll go to the book of Romans, chapter
[52:56] 1, vers 16 through 32. But while they're
[52:59] turning,
[53:01] some of you have got this this graph. Do
[53:04] do you got that? And in that graph, I
[53:09] don't know if they can even show it. Can
[53:12] you show it up here for just a second?
[53:19] All right. Soon as they'll get it,
[53:22] you'll let me know when it's up there.
[53:24] Some of you point. Is it up there?
[53:26] Ronnie, let me know. Good. Thank you,
[53:28] Ronnie.
[53:29] Okay. I want you to see that the the
[53:33] natural man, he's worldly, he's fleshy.
[53:35] He's the old man. He has five senses.
[53:38] But notice that he is carnally minded.
[53:42] Now, carnally minded is emnity with God.
[53:44] neither knows the things of God. That's
[53:46] why until you're born again,
[53:50] you don't understand the things of God.
[53:52] So Jesus told Nicodemus,
[53:55] except a man be born again of the spirit
[53:57] because that which is flesh, it's flesh,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; but that which is spirit is spirit.
[54:04] And understand that Jesus said, "The
[54:07] words that I speak unto you, they are
[54:09] spirit and they are life."
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, they're different than just
[54:14] you and I speaking. His words are spirit
[54:18] and life. And so, you hearing the word
[54:21] of God, hearing God's eternal word, it
[54:25] is Zoey, God's own life,
[54:29] &gt;&gt; comes through the hearing gate
[54:31] &gt;&gt; into the womb of your mind.
[54:34] Okay?
[54:36] And there's where either you accept or
[54:39] reject the word of God
[54:41] and you stop the word from going beyond
[54:43] your mind. I don't believe it. I doubt
[54:46] it. I don't believe that at all. Well,
[54:49] guess what? The word of God, the germ of
[54:53] life, let's call it the sperm of God
[54:57] is stopped right there. The spermicide
[54:59] of unbelief kills the seed.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Not the seed, the germ of life.
[55:05] But when you
[55:08] open your mind
[55:10] and accept through your sp and and I'll
[55:14] show you the quote where brother Bram
[55:16] said you you have a spiritual womb and
[55:19] you have a physical womb
[55:22] and when the germ of life god's own
[55:25] words come beyond
[55:27] your carnal mind
[55:30] and it is not stopped by unbelief Right?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; And now it comes through, okay? It comes
[55:39] through that part, through your spirit,
[55:42] the womb of your spirit, and the seed
[55:45] then keeps going.
[55:48] It's like a woman when she gets
[55:49] pregnant, there's all kinds of
[55:52] spermatzoa.
[55:54] Your biology class tells you that.
[55:57] thousands of sperm from the male because
[56:01] the female has the egg.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; But she in a union with love
[56:10] when
[56:11] that seed germ of life is passed into
[56:17] the woman, there is one little germ of
[56:20] life that fights its way past all the
[56:23] rest to get to that egg.
[56:26] And there is a special thing that
[56:28] happens and I taught this before and the
[56:30] rest of you probably weren't here
[56:33] but that spermatzoa
[56:35] that germ of life then it connects to
[56:39] that seed and as soon as it does and
[56:41] medical science has proven this that
[56:44] once it touches that egg it begins to
[56:48] now bore itself until it penetrates the
[56:52] egg. And when it does, there is a the
[56:56] egg now
[56:58] closes itself off because it's now
[57:02] germatized.
[57:03] No other spermatizoa can get in there.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; And whatever seed
[57:12] &gt;&gt; was there that is germatized
[57:15] will bring forth of its own kind.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Genesis 1:11
[57:23] that every seed that is within itself
[57:26] will bring forth of its own kind.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; So we see here
[57:31] when a man is born again he no longer
[57:34] has
[57:35] a carnal mind but now he has a spiritual
[57:38] mind.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; But when he gets the Holy Ghost and God
[57:42] comes in he now has the very mind
[57:46] &gt;&gt; of God himself. the very mind of Christ.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Carnally minded, spiritually minded,
[57:54] and then we have the very mind of
[57:56] Christ. Okay, let's let's go on. And I'm
[57:59] going to have you, brother Mark, if you
[58:01] would. What did I tell you? We're going
[58:03] to
[58:05] Romans 1 starting at verse 16.
[58:10] For I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[58:12] Christ. For it is the power of God unto
[58:15] salvation, to everyone that believeth,
[58:18] to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
[58:21] For therein is the righteousness of God
[58:24] revealed from faith to faith. Look at
[58:26] this. The righteousness of God revealed
[58:30] from faith unto It's a continuing.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; It's an unfolding
[58:35] &gt;&gt; from faith to faith.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Go ahead. As it is written,
[58:40] the just shall live by faith. But the
[58:43] wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[58:45] against all ungodliness and
[58:47] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[58:49] truth in unrighteousness.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
[58:54] The very wrath of God is now being
[58:57] revealed. Okay?
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Because that which may be known of God
[59:00] is manifest.
[59:02] For God hath showed it unto them. For
[59:05] the invisible things of him from the
[59:06] creation of the world are clearly seen,
[59:09] being understood by the things that are
[59:11] made, even his eternal power and
[59:13] godhead. So that they are without
[59:15] excuse.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; They are without excuse from the
[59:17] infinite to the finite.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; The scientists and the doctors and
[59:23] everybody says, "We see God's
[59:26] fingerprints on everything."
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; And they are without excuse. They
[59:30] realize, wow, this just didn't happen by
[59:34] a bang.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; That there is an eternal plan in all of
[59:41] this.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And they can't explain it. So now watch
[59:45] as we see that they are without excuse.
[59:48] Go ahead, brother Mark. Because that
[59:50] when they knew God, they glorified him
[59:52] not as God, neither were thankful, but
[59:54] became vain in their imaginations. And
[59:57] their foolish heart was darkened.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; So they knew God. They saw God in
[1:00:00] nature. They were seeing gods
[1:00:03] manifesting himself. Okay?
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Professing themselves to be wise, they
[1:00:08] became fools and change the glory of the
[1:00:11] uncorruptible God into an image made
[1:00:13] like to corruptible man and to birds and
[1:00:16] for-footed beasts and creeping things.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; See, he's got to put God in a box.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I I guess God is um he's the
[1:00:25] son, so we'll worship the sun. Or he's a
[1:00:28] for-footed animal. He's a a lion. We'll
[1:00:31] worship the lion. He's changing the
[1:00:34] invisible God into a visible carnal
[1:00:38] image. Go ahead, brother Mark.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Wherefore God also gave them up to
[1:00:42] uncleanness through the lust of their
[1:00:44] own hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[1:00:48] between themselves.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; So he gave them up to what? Uncleaness.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Fornicating spirits, seducing spirits,
[1:00:55] enticing spirits, Jezebel spirits.
[1:00:59] religious spirits,
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; okay? Who changed the truth of God into
[1:01:04] a lie and worshiped and served the
[1:01:06] creature more than the creator who is
[1:01:08] blessed forever. Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; For this God,
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; watch this.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; For this cause.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; For this cause. What cause? For this
[1:01:15] cause. They they they they changed the
[1:01:18] truth of God.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; They perverted it. Made it a lie.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; It was done by a big bang. And and man
[1:01:26] was evolved.
[1:01:28] Charles Darwin says, "We come from an
[1:01:30] ape and after all these years and you
[1:01:33] see homo sapien finally comes up and now
[1:01:36] he's upright man." And for this cause,
[1:01:39] go ahead.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; For this cause God gave them up unto
[1:01:41] vile affections for even their women to
[1:01:44] change the natural use into that which
[1:01:46] is against nature.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; So watch this.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; And likewise also the men hold on Mark.
[1:01:51] Man, you are such a good reader.
[1:01:55] Such a good reader. He's got Hey, Mark
[1:01:58] has got that FM midnight radio voice,
[1:02:03] doesn't he not? It's just that soothing
[1:02:05] Hello Saints. This is Mark Stany
[1:02:09] coming at the midnight hour. I'll be too
[1:02:11] with you till 6:00 a.m. Anyway,
[1:02:14] that doesn't matter. But you got such a
[1:02:16] good voice. But for this God uh cause
[1:02:19] God gave up to vile unclean affections
[1:02:24] and the women. Watch it first manifest
[1:02:27] in the weaker vessel.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; That which is against nature. Verse 27.
[1:02:36] And likewise also the men leaving the
[1:02:38] natural use of the woman burned in their
[1:02:41] lust one toward another. men with men
[1:02:43] working that which is unseemly and
[1:02:46] receiving in themselves that recompense
[1:02:48] of their error which was meek. And even
[1:02:51] as they did not like to retain God in
[1:02:52] their knowledge, God gave them over to a
[1:02:55] reprobate mind to do those things which
[1:02:57] are not convenient.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Watch this now. They didn't like to
[1:03:01] retain God in their knowledge. In other
[1:03:03] words, hey, I don't believe that uh you
[1:03:06] know these things that it just happened.
[1:03:09] did. So now for this cause God see
[1:03:13] there's cause and effect. So what God
[1:03:14] did is he says okay you think you're so
[1:03:17] wise you become foolish.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Look at the wisdom of this world. Is it
[1:03:22] not foolishness with God?
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; For isn't the preaching the co the cross
[1:03:27] to them that perish
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; foolishness?
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; But unto us which are saved it is what?
[1:03:34] The power of God. Amen.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; So he gave him over to a rep probate
[1:03:38] mind.
[1:03:40] Go ahead. Being filled with all
[1:03:42] unrighteousness, fornication,
[1:03:44] wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
[1:03:47] full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
[1:03:50] malignity, whisperers, backbiters,
[1:03:53] haters of God, despiteful, proud,
[1:03:56] boasters, inventors of evil things.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Inventors of evil things, disobedient.
[1:04:02] Wow. This this takes
[1:04:06] now all of you kids
[1:04:08] disobedient to parents.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Do you know that it says he who curses
[1:04:17] his mother and father should be stoned
[1:04:20] and put to death?
[1:04:24] We wouldn't have so many kids
[1:04:27] here in the assembly if it happened to
[1:04:29] you. be now you know look I I I it's not
[1:04:34] a funny thing
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; the Bible says honor your father and
[1:04:38] mother
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; give respect unto them okay so dis look
[1:04:43] at this idoltors and these guys and
[1:04:46] haters of God and he says and
[1:04:48] disobedient to parents
[1:04:51] okay
[1:04:52] without understanding covenant breakers
[1:04:56] without natural affections implacable
[1:04:58] unmerciful who knowing the judgment of
[1:05:01] God, that they which commit such things
[1:05:03] are worthy of death, not only do the
[1:05:05] same, but have pleasure in them that do
[1:05:07] them.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; They not only know it's wrong,
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; but they have pleasure in doing it. Look
[1:05:13] at the world. That's what they're doing.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; They're mega dosing
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; on sin
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; and they'll laugh in your face.
[1:05:22] one of my friends who just as I came to
[1:05:27] the Lord um
[1:05:30] uh anyway I remember witnessing to him
[1:05:34] his name was Jud. I said, Jud, I said, I
[1:05:38] gave my heart to the Lord and everything
[1:05:40] like
[1:05:42] ah you guys in this Christianity, I'll
[1:05:44] take my choice. You know what? It's just
[1:05:46] a figment of man's a nation imagination.
[1:05:50] I'll take my chances. I said, this one,
[1:05:52] you're going to lose.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Because at the end of the road is God.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And he said, well, I'm going to take my
[1:06:01] chances. So there are those that have
[1:06:05] been turned over to reprobate minds.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Understand? You see, if you're not going
[1:06:11] to get the mind of Christ,
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; you'll take the mind of somebody else.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Who you are of your father, the devil,
[1:06:21] and his mind, his works, his thoughts,
[1:06:24] you'll do. You'll be murderers,
[1:06:27] deceitful, haters of God, despisers of
[1:06:31] those that aren't good. All of those
[1:06:33] things. Look at that. And they will be
[1:06:35] disobedient to parents.
[1:06:38] Okay.
[1:06:39] Now,
[1:06:41] uh I want to show you because we're
[1:06:43] talking about uh there is a spiritual
[1:06:46] womb and a physical womb. So, Brother
[1:06:48] Brennham picks this up in a sermon where
[1:06:51] brother Brennham, now I of all the years
[1:06:55] of my believing the message, and I've
[1:06:58] been studying this sermon, the spoken
[1:07:00] word is the original seed. It's one of
[1:07:02] the longest sermons.
[1:07:04] But brother Brennham, my wife and I were
[1:07:08] there in the bedroom and we're listening
[1:07:10] and brother Brenham says, "Now I know uh
[1:07:14] that my doctrine and some of my teaching
[1:07:17] has really caused some people to
[1:07:20] misunderstand me." And he says, "So what
[1:07:22] I want to do, I want to lay it out very
[1:07:25] perfectly and clear so I will not be
[1:07:27] misunderstood." And he says, and he goes
[1:07:30] on into the spoken word is the original
[1:07:33] seed. Now on paragraph 178, let he says,
[1:07:37] let's go back now and pick up again and
[1:07:40] come down for something. You remember
[1:07:42] last Sunday, Sunday's service was the
[1:07:46] gate to the soul. You remember now there
[1:07:51] is a womb of the physical and there is a
[1:07:53] womb for the spirit.
[1:07:56] Did you do you believe that there is a
[1:07:58] spiritual womb and there is a physical
[1:08:00] womb and the mind is the womb to the
[1:08:05] spirit? Your mind. Where is the greatest
[1:08:08] battle ever fought? Mind
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; So now God chose the heart and Satan
[1:08:14] chose the mind.
[1:08:16] Because Satan wants to throw all of his
[1:08:21] anointing, his science,
[1:08:24] all of his knowledge. He wants to throw
[1:08:27] it at you and he wants to bombard your
[1:08:30] mind and said that can't be all of this.
[1:08:32] Ah, I tell you, you that believe in God,
[1:08:35] there is no God. That's a figment. Man
[1:08:37] made him up.
[1:08:41] And so you you you see this these
[1:08:45] there's a physical womb and a spiritual
[1:08:49] womb. So the greatest battle that you're
[1:08:51] going to fight all of you
[1:08:54] are is in your mind.
[1:08:56] And Satan will use these entrances or
[1:09:01] the gateways to your spirit
[1:09:06] to try to anoint you with his unbelief.
[1:09:11] Because God's got the anointing which
[1:09:15] brings faith and Satan's got an
[1:09:17] anointing which brings unbelief.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together on that? Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand, brother
[1:09:26] Brennham even said an elect seed can go
[1:09:29] many years before he recognizes who he
[1:09:32] is
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; because you're hardheaded, hard-hearted.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Okay? But guess what? God gets his man.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how hard you are and
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; all the things that you go through. It
[1:09:46] took a while and you went had to go out
[1:09:48] and do your thing and next thing you
[1:09:50] know God gets a hold of you.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Got a friend of mine from South Africa.
[1:09:55] He said, "You know where God got a hold
[1:09:56] of me? On the dance floor."
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; And he told me, "What are you doing
[1:10:01] here?"
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; On a dance floor of all places. And he
[1:10:06] said, "I stopped right in the middle of
[1:10:08] the dance and everything's going on like
[1:10:10] this." And he said, "What am I doing
[1:10:11] here?"
[1:10:15] Now let's
[1:10:17] the mind is the womb of the spirit.
[1:10:19] Let's continue on. Why? Now remember I
[1:10:21] told you last Sunday draw it out here
[1:10:24] for you. These five senses that enters
[1:10:27] this seed from the outside.
[1:10:30] Okay? See, taste, feel, smell, hear five
[1:10:36] on the inside. conscience and so forth
[1:10:39] from the inside f on the life side.
[1:10:44] That's the inside. There's only one
[1:10:48] that's you're on the basis of free moral
[1:10:51] agency to accept
[1:10:54] to take in or let out there. Look,
[1:10:58] there's either faith or doubt.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Either faith or doubt.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. So you can hear the word
[1:11:07] comes through the hearing of the ear,
[1:11:08] the heargate comes through the mind.
[1:11:12] But if right there in your heart, I
[1:11:15] don't believe it, stops it right there.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:11:20] And
[1:11:23] uh so gives you free moral agency. You
[1:11:28] have the right to choose.
[1:11:32] And yet um
[1:11:35] you let me let me say this and clarify
[1:11:38] this.
[1:11:39] It may be a little bit hard to
[1:11:41] understand. You say you chose him. No,
[1:11:44] he chose you first.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; No man can come to the father except my
[1:11:51] father draw him
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; first.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; So no matter how well I can go to
[1:11:58] church. Yeah, you can. Yeah, I can do
[1:12:00] what you do. I can wear a dress. I can
[1:12:02] do those things. I can do the legality
[1:12:05] of the word of God. I can keep the
[1:12:08] commandments and still not have life.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; That doesn't give you life.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; And you can be religious.
[1:12:19] See, the deceitfulness of religion, it's
[1:12:23] a false covering.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Religion is a covering. The first thing
[1:12:28] that Adam and Eve did to cover their
[1:12:31] nakedness was to make a religion.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; To hide their nakedness. And they ran
[1:12:38] from God.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; And the there's many people that run
[1:12:43] from really serving God. So they have a
[1:12:48] fig leaf covering, a religion that
[1:12:52] covers their conscience.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Well, I go to church on Sunday.
[1:12:57] I give unto the church my money. I do
[1:12:59] this that. Yeah. He doesn't deny all
[1:13:02] that. And they satisfy a religious
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; obligation
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; guilt.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Well, I go to church.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; I give them my tithes. The rich young
[1:13:13] ruler
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; from my birth. I have done all these
[1:13:17] things, but thou lackest one thing.
[1:13:21] See, religious people
[1:13:25] uh want to only satisfy their religious
[1:13:29] tastes, but they don't want to give
[1:13:31] themselves totally 100% to the Lord.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; They honor God with their lips,
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; but their hearts
[1:13:39] are far from him.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:13:45] Okay. So, we see the three. Let let's go
[1:13:48] ahead and go back to that three-fold
[1:13:50] nature the graph there
[1:13:55] and and
[1:14:02] no go to the I'm sorry the other one
[1:14:04] that that yeah that one there. Okay. So
[1:14:07] we see the man is a body spirit soul.
[1:14:11] Okay. Now you can have the Holy Spirit
[1:14:15] on the outside of your body on the flesh
[1:14:18] man and you go to church. Oh, I feel
[1:14:21] good. Oh, warm fuzzy. Isn't that good?
[1:14:24] God, you're so good. Okay. The rain
[1:14:27] falls on the just and the unjust. So,
[1:14:31] the outer court has got nothing to do
[1:14:34] with the spirit within you. You're just
[1:14:37] feeling, oh, I just, oh, I just feel
[1:14:39] good. Oh, it's And so people go and they
[1:14:42] go to church to feel good,
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; to have a religious satisfying. That's
[1:14:47] why brother Brennham says in the sermon,
[1:14:50] a thinking man's filter, he says uh he
[1:14:53] says they will choose a religion or a
[1:14:57] church that satisfies their worldly
[1:15:00] taste.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I can I I remember going to my
[1:15:05] wife's family reunion. They were
[1:15:07] Catholic, very strict Catholic. Their
[1:15:10] priest was there with them and he's
[1:15:12] drunk. He's telling dirty jokes.
[1:15:16] He he is there with them and uh
[1:15:19] everything. And one of her family came
[1:15:21] up and said, "See, our priest comes here
[1:15:24] and he just does these things." And you
[1:15:27] guys, what makes you think you're so
[1:15:29] holy?
[1:15:31] What makes you think we're you're better
[1:15:33] than we are? Look at our priest. He's
[1:15:36] coming here. He's the You see? And so
[1:15:38] they satisfy
[1:15:41] this religion by, well, I can I can
[1:15:45] still smoke, drink, cuss, I can tell
[1:15:47] dirty jokes. I can go to dances. I can
[1:15:49] go to movies. I everything because it
[1:15:52] really doesn't condemn me. Brother
[1:15:53] Brennham said that they have no
[1:15:56] conscience.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "Why? You got no more
[1:16:00] conscience than the snakes's got hips."
[1:16:03] He he said you could wear a 10gallon
[1:16:07] hat. You're so low down. You could wear
[1:16:10] a 10gon hat and slide under the belly of
[1:16:14] a snake and your hat never touched the
[1:16:16] belly of the snake. That's pretty low
[1:16:19] down.
[1:16:22] So
[1:16:24] understand now, brother Brennham is
[1:16:25] giving us an understanding that you can
[1:16:28] have this uh anointing on the outside.
[1:16:35] The rain falls on according to Hebrews
[1:16:38] 6:7 on the just and the unjust.
[1:16:42] It's the carnal man. He doesn't change.
[1:16:46] He doesn't need to change.
[1:16:48] But then we see the spirit of man.
[1:16:54] Um,
[1:16:55] and the Holy Spirit anoints gifts of the
[1:16:59] spirit. Now, I gave you this one also.
[1:17:02] Can you change to this one, Matthew?
[1:17:05] Okay, go ahead and change to this one
[1:17:08] because we talked about the gifts that
[1:17:10] are in the body. Now, remember all the
[1:17:12] gifts that are in the body. And now, how
[1:17:15] many know that gifts and callings are
[1:17:18] without repentance?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; If you've got the gift of tongues, if
[1:17:22] you've got the gift of prophecy, if
[1:17:23] you've got these gifts, they were there
[1:17:26] when you were born.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; But they come to fruition when you come
[1:17:31] to the knowledge and you and God begins
[1:17:33] to anoint you and you see and God
[1:17:36] anoints you. What is it? You were born
[1:17:38] with the gifts.
[1:17:40] I remember uh one of the brothers who
[1:17:43] was a a minister. He said, "I used my
[1:17:46] gift of discernment. I had discernment
[1:17:49] as a young man and he said, "I worked in
[1:17:51] a bar. Men would come up to the bar, sit
[1:17:53] down, and before they ordered, I mixed
[1:17:55] their drink and set it in front of
[1:17:56] them."
[1:17:59] And he said, they said, "Well, how did
[1:18:01] you?" He said, "I just know.
[1:18:04] Let's have this gift." gifts and
[1:18:06] callings are without repentance. Now
[1:18:10] understand here that you have the
[1:18:12] according to Romans 12 4-9 you have the
[1:18:15] gift of exhorting.
[1:18:18] You can be a good exhorter and not even
[1:18:21] be called of God. You can be a good
[1:18:22] eloquent speaker. Paul said I don't come
[1:18:25] to you here with enticing words of man's
[1:18:28] wisdom. I'm I come to you here in
[1:18:30] weakness and in trembling.
[1:18:34] You can have the gift of teaching,
[1:18:36] prophecy, ministry, ruling, giving,
[1:18:39] mercy, governments, and helps.
[1:18:43] That that gift of helps. Every pastor
[1:18:45] loves to have somebody in the church
[1:18:47] that has just the gift of helps. You
[1:18:49] need help.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. Thank you. Gift of helps. And
[1:18:54] we aren't going to go all, but these are
[1:18:57] gifts on the spirit realm. Now then in 1
[1:19:00] Corinthians 12 8-10
[1:19:03] we see here you have these gifts of the
[1:19:06] spirit but they are anointing your
[1:19:10] spirit.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Holy spirit upon your
[1:19:15] spirit.
[1:19:17] And you can you can discern spirits. You
[1:19:21] can have interpretations of tongues. You
[1:19:24] can have knowledge. You can prophesy.
[1:19:26] Did not Caiaphas prophesy?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, we could go through scriptural
[1:19:32] examples.
[1:19:34] Have the gift of wisdom. Paul said, "You
[1:19:37] might have faith to move mountains and
[1:19:38] have not love." You're just a tinkling
[1:19:41] symbol.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Healing,
[1:19:45] miracles, and tongues. That's why
[1:19:47] somebody says, "I'm not going to believe
[1:19:49] anything of your ministry until I see
[1:19:51] miracles and signs and wonders." Well,
[1:19:53] that's what they're looking for. And let
[1:19:55] me tell you out there among denomination
[1:19:58] or all kinds of healings and miracles
[1:19:59] and stuff. I'm not looking to signs. I
[1:20:03] look to the word.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Signs follow the believer. I could tell
[1:20:08] you time after time and and and tell you
[1:20:11] of the times when I come back, whether
[1:20:14] it's these ministers that go overseas,
[1:20:16] whether it's brother Mario or whatever,
[1:20:19] and you go and minister and God answers
[1:20:22] the people's needs and the gift was
[1:20:25] anointed of God. You spoke and they
[1:20:27] said, "How did you know?"
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; It was a God anointing the gift. Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; And there are all kinds of excuse me,
[1:20:36] but I will say supernatural gifts and
[1:20:39] signs that even follow my ministry, but
[1:20:42] I don't come back here and tell you all.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't put it in a magazine.
[1:20:48] Well, I'll tell you what. On December
[1:20:49] the 5th over here on this in 1988 and I
[1:20:52] was praying for somebody and this and
[1:20:54] God showed me and I saw the pillar of
[1:20:56] fire, all this stuff. Well, next thing
[1:20:59] you know, it's all these things. And
[1:21:01] hey, hey, listen. I don't put that in
[1:21:04] the forefront.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; I just believe that God does it.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make myself something
[1:21:11] big.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; I always point to him.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "You think I'm the one
[1:21:17] that does these things?"
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Watch the humility. I'm not him. I just
[1:21:21] happen to be the vessel that God uses.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Okay? Do you understand that?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is one of the key factors
[1:21:30] that drew me to this message
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; was the humility of this prophet.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Never did he point to himself.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; He could have taken this gift. I think
[1:21:44] one of the men come up wanted to give
[1:21:45] him what is it over a million bucks, one
[1:21:47] half million dollars or something like
[1:21:49] that. How many ministers within the
[1:21:51] message? Praise God. I'm going to put
[1:21:52] that in my faith magazine. Somebody gave
[1:21:55] me a million half dollars. Oh, praise
[1:21:57] God. They're blessing my ministry.
[1:21:59] Brother Bram said, "No, sir." He refused
[1:22:02] it.
[1:22:04] I think um
[1:22:08] how quickly some would say, "Who's going
[1:22:10] to be a faith? How many here will give a
[1:22:11] $100?" It would be somebody over here
[1:22:13] give 200. How many? It's like an
[1:22:15] auction. Stop it.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; When Oral Roberts said God was holding
[1:22:21] him hostage for several million dollars,
[1:22:26] I thought, are you kidding me? Oral
[1:22:29] Roberts tells his people, God is holding
[1:22:32] me hostage and he's going to take my
[1:22:34] life if you don't give millions of
[1:22:36] dollar. And so next thing you know,
[1:22:38] they're to and here's the telephone
[1:22:40] line. Call now. Call now. I don't want
[1:22:42] to die. Call now. And so all these
[1:22:44] people and and and guess what couple
[1:22:46] hours later got millions of dollars.
[1:22:50] I asked my board one time if I threw
[1:22:52] that out to you, what would it was nice
[1:22:56] knowing you, brother Ron. God bless you.
[1:22:59] It's just like
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; see you.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; See, God doesn't do but the foolishness.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said religion has
[1:23:09] become big business.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. They fleece the people instead of
[1:23:16] feeding the people.
[1:23:18] They make you the servants of them
[1:23:20] instead of them serving you.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Look at brother Brandham.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; He was a servant unto all.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go on here. And I wasn't
[1:23:31] going to preach. In fact, my wife asked
[1:23:33] me if I was going to pre. I said, "No,
[1:23:35] I'm you know." And then I went to my
[1:23:37] office and they he says, "Are you going
[1:23:39] to church tonight?" Yeah. Yeah.
[1:23:43] My 15 words per minute was just blazing
[1:23:45] on that.
[1:23:47] computer.
[1:23:49] So we've got three definite
[1:23:52] characteristics
[1:23:53] of body.
[1:23:56] It is the outward shell. It's seen.
[1:23:58] Brother Bram says, "Now you can see me,
[1:24:01] but you've never seen the real me."
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Because there is a life force inside of
[1:24:07] me
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; that you've never seen. You see the
[1:24:10] shell. Now, when we get over there and
[1:24:13] we have our theophony body and glorified
[1:24:16] and the celestial and all this and it
[1:24:17] comes together and whatever and brother
[1:24:20] Brennan wondered when we get into
[1:24:22] heaven, will we know one another? He
[1:24:25] said, "Here's two clouds. Maybe I'm
[1:24:27] going to be a cloud. Another cloud
[1:24:29] passes by." And I asked, "Is that you,
[1:24:31] brother Neville?" Now understand if we
[1:24:35] are knowledgeable enough,
[1:24:39] okay,
[1:24:40] to be able to recognize somebody here
[1:24:44] and when we get over there and we know
[1:24:47] him even as he is known and we have such
[1:24:50] a greater understanding, do you think
[1:24:51] we'll know one another's name?
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; You think we'll recognize one another?
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Uh, hold on. Hold on. Uh,
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; yeah. Yeah. I I'm just Don't Don't Don't
[1:25:03] tell me. Don't tell me uh brother
[1:25:08] that won't happen over there.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; You will know immediately. It's right
[1:25:13] there. The older I get sometimes uh
[1:25:17] somebody's name I Jesus I chase it for
[1:25:20] minutes. It's frustrating. That won't
[1:25:23] happen over there.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. because you will have such a far
[1:25:29] greater understanding.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. So um this outward man
[1:25:35] is the one you brush his teeth, you comb
[1:25:38] his hair, you wash his face, you take
[1:25:40] care of the carnal man every day, but
[1:25:43] he's the one that really fights you the
[1:25:46] most. You know why? Because it's a
[1:25:47] byproduct of sin.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Everyone for all have sinned and come
[1:25:52] short of the glory of God. and the wages
[1:25:54] of sin is death.
[1:25:57] So you came into this, brother Mrennham
[1:25:59] said, you came into to this dimension,
[1:26:03] this earth hybrid,
[1:26:06] and because of your prostitute parents,
[1:26:09] Adam and Eve, he said, you came down
[1:26:12] here carnal.
[1:26:15] You bypassed your theophony, came down
[1:26:17] here, and so here you are. Bang, you
[1:26:20] just all of a sudden showed up. And I
[1:26:22] want all of you to understand, none of
[1:26:24] you are a mistake. Your parents might
[1:26:26] not have planned for you. You might have
[1:26:29] been that baby five years after they
[1:26:31] thought they were done. All a sudden,
[1:26:32] bing, you show up.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; It's still in the plan of God.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; None of you are a mistake.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; God watched over your seed, over your
[1:26:44] great great ding ding ding down here
[1:26:46] like a pinball machine. All of a sudden,
[1:26:48] dang, here you come.
[1:26:51] Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; But you didn't know who you were.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Why? God took it from your remembrance.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; You were carly minded. You were just
[1:27:01] going along in life thinking, "Ah, well,
[1:27:04] I guess I'll be a I'll be a surfer. I'll
[1:27:07] be a marine biologist. I'll, you know,
[1:27:10] I'm going to do this and that and
[1:27:11] everything." And and you're you're kind
[1:27:13] of going on your way. And then all of a
[1:27:15] sudden, God
[1:27:17] keeps his appointment.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Rem said, "Jesus keeps every
[1:27:23] appointment." Each one of you, I want
[1:27:25] you to know this that God chose you and
[1:27:31] gave you a time when he's going to
[1:27:33] reveal himself
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; to you.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; And he says that's what a Christian is
[1:27:40] is when God comes to you and reveals
[1:27:43] himself to you personally. Y
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; it's not of the God of your father and
[1:27:48] mother and the God of the prophet and
[1:27:50] the God of the Bible,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; That's all historical stuff. That's
[1:27:54] that's out here. But when God comes down
[1:27:56] and talks to you,
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; See, Jacob
[1:28:01] never had that personal experience with
[1:28:03] God until he met him face to face.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have all kinds of Bethl
[1:28:08] experiences. That's wonderful. Great. I
[1:28:10] see angels ascending, descending.
[1:28:12] Brother Billy Paul said, "I saw the
[1:28:14] angel
[1:28:15] He said, "Brother Ron, it never changed
[1:28:17] me."
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; So you can see all of the supernatural.
[1:28:22] It doesn't change you.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; But when God has the appointed time, you
[1:28:28] can run, but you cannot hide.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; God is going to get you.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. Laian
[1:28:36] uh church age, there are three things
[1:28:38] that are always going to be a problem
[1:28:40] with the flesh man.
[1:28:43] the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
[1:28:47] eye, and the pride of life. Every one of
[1:28:50] you, you're born with that. So now
[1:28:52] watching church age, brother Rem says,
[1:28:55] "A quick look at the scriptures which
[1:28:57] involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will
[1:29:00] bring out the truth of this
[1:29:02] proposition." In Matthew 4, wherein
[1:29:04] Jesus is tempted of the devil, he
[1:29:06] overcome the personal temptations of
[1:29:08] Satan by the word and by the word only.
[1:29:14] In each of these three major trials that
[1:29:16] corresponded
[1:29:18] exactly to the temptation of the garden
[1:29:20] of Eden, the lust of the flesh, the lust
[1:29:23] of the eye, and the pride of life. Jesus
[1:29:26] overcame by the word.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; He fell to the personal temptation of
[1:29:32] Satan by failing to use the word.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; See, Satan came to her and said, "It's
[1:29:40] written.
[1:29:43] Okay.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; She could have said it's also written.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; But she didn't. She didn't use the word.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. And Eve fell. Now, what was the
[1:29:57] channel in her spirit realm that Satan
[1:30:01] used to anoint her?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Reasoning.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Took the mind. Don't you want to be like
[1:30:07] God? Yeah,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; that's right. Don't you want to know
[1:30:10] good from evil? Don't you want to be
[1:30:11] more like Yeah.
[1:30:14] Right.
[1:30:15] High five. That's what I want.
[1:30:19] And he and brother Bram said he stopped
[1:30:23] or he got her to stop long enough to
[1:30:26] listen to his reasoning
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; and then he took her physically.
[1:30:34] Seducing her with words for years
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; got her to stop long enough. And when
[1:30:41] she accepted his doubt of the word,
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Satan took her.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Then he imparted his seed.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; It's a religious spirit.
[1:30:59] Adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[1:31:01] word. But Jesus overcame by the word.
[1:31:03] And right now, let me say this that the
[1:31:05] only way to be an overcomer also is the
[1:31:09] only way that you can know if you are
[1:31:11] overcoming because that word can't fail.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; If you're going to overcome these
[1:31:18] temptations of the lust of the fa the
[1:31:21] flesh, the lust of the eye, and the
[1:31:22] pride of life, it's going to only be the
[1:31:24] word. And God quickens that word. That
[1:31:27] word is your defense.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; So you go from the body to the spirit,
[1:31:31] which is that unseen
[1:31:34] man, the the inside man that really none
[1:31:38] of us see. We have an outer shell that
[1:31:41] we put on the face and we go to church
[1:31:44] and we dress it up and we look okay, but
[1:31:46] inside you could be a ravening wool.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; So it's not the outward appearance.
[1:31:55] Now it's the spirit because the spirit
[1:31:58] is controlled by the inside,
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; the control room.
[1:32:04] You can look right, talk right, walk
[1:32:06] right, do all of these things, keep the
[1:32:08] commandments, and still be lost.
[1:32:12] Now,
[1:32:14] so you go from the body to the spirit
[1:32:17] and you can tell
[1:32:19] who is on the control tower by watching
[1:32:23] what the spirit of the man or the woman
[1:32:26] is feeding upon.
[1:32:28] Let me go into the house. Let me go into
[1:32:31] their room. Let me see what they feed
[1:32:33] their spirit on and I'll tell you who's
[1:32:37] sitting on the throne. Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; So the soul is the heart of man. It's
[1:32:44] the control tower. Now if we pardon me,
[1:32:50] excuse me,
[1:32:52] go to that three-fold nature there of
[1:32:56] man. And I haven't got it drawn in here,
[1:32:59] but when they you take in here, if you
[1:33:02] guys could just imagine, there's a
[1:33:05] little throne right here. I on one of my
[1:33:07] other graphs I I drew an actual throne
[1:33:11] and below the throne because what
[1:33:12] brother Brandham had done one time he
[1:33:14] took the graph and he drew and he drew a
[1:33:17] throne sitting there no one was sitting
[1:33:20] on it but below the throne was a snake
[1:33:23] and he says now that's your carnal
[1:33:25] nature you were born with because your
[1:33:27] first union you had
[1:33:32] and your first kinsman redeemer
[1:33:35] your First, you're he called it your
[1:33:38] nearer kinsman, Satan.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; That's why he's got a right to your
[1:33:43] mind.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; So, seed into your mind. It's a mind
[1:33:51] battle.
[1:33:53] Okay.
[1:33:54] So, if you could draw a throne right
[1:33:57] here and have a snake below it. He says,
[1:33:58] "Now when the word of God goes through
[1:34:02] the hearing gate, goes through the womb
[1:34:05] of the mind
[1:34:08] into the very heart. Thy word, oh Lord,
[1:34:11] have I hid in my heart
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; that I learn not to sin against you." So
[1:34:15] it comes in here. And when this seed is
[1:34:18] germatized,
[1:34:20] at that time when the sperm comes to the
[1:34:23] egg, it germmitizes it. It's fertilized.
[1:34:26] And guess what?
[1:34:28] born again. There's really been a change
[1:34:31] in me.
[1:34:33] Hallelujah. I'm a new creature in
[1:34:36] Christ.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; I'm born again. I'm born of the spirit
[1:34:39] because thy word is spirit and it's
[1:34:42] life. And so the that that sperm
[1:34:46] spermmitzoa
[1:34:48] went through the hearing gate. Faith
[1:34:50] cometh by hearing through the mind into
[1:34:53] the heartates that seed. And guess what?
[1:34:56] Now you're a new creature. And he says
[1:34:59] he put an X on that serpent. He said
[1:35:02] your first nature which had rule over
[1:35:04] you.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; He says now is dead and Christ sits on
[1:35:09] the throne room.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that lovely?
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; So you begin to now understand the
[1:35:16] concept of body. May you be wholly
[1:35:19] sanctified
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; in your body
[1:35:22] and in your spirit.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Right? and in your soul, body, spirit,
[1:35:28] soul.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, even after the baptism of the
[1:35:33] Holy Ghost, the flesh or carnal man is
[1:35:35] still present with you to hinder
[1:35:38] everything you do.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; How many have ever recognized that?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, man. Satan will use your own
[1:35:48] weaknesses against you.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:52] Satan has a right now to attack you by
[1:35:55] using any of the physical senses.
[1:35:58] So, he will try to get you to where, oh,
[1:36:00] I don't feel God.
[1:36:02] Well, there's a lot of times you don't
[1:36:04] feel God. God doesn't come to you
[1:36:06] through this five physical senses. I
[1:36:09] don't see him. I don't hear him.
[1:36:14] I don't feel him. Do you see what I'm
[1:36:16] saying? He's not using. There's a lot of
[1:36:18] times you don't feel God
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; and you've done nothing wrong.
[1:36:24] You're just going through life and then
[1:36:27] all of a sudden you wake up one morning,
[1:36:30] you don't really feel anointed.
[1:36:34] And so you don't I don't feel God. Where
[1:36:37] is you? Oh God, why don't I feel you?
[1:36:40] Well, listen. God is weaning you away
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; from feelings.
[1:36:47] He's going to walk let you walk through
[1:36:49] dry places.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; He's going to let you work out your own
[1:36:53] salvation with fear and trembling.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Okay? God is God. He's a father God. He
[1:36:59] teaches you to come away and wean you
[1:37:03] away from feeling
[1:37:07] on the outward man.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; So he will pull his anointing away from
[1:37:12] you and then watch your reaction. Are
[1:37:15] you going to go whine and cry in the
[1:37:17] corner? I don't feel it. Maybe I'm not a
[1:37:19] Christian. Maybe maybe it's not really
[1:37:21] real. I'll stop.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. There's a lot of times I don't
[1:37:26] feel like a Christian, but I'm not going
[1:37:29] by feelings.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going by faith.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Because faith is the evidence of things
[1:37:35] not seen and the substance of things
[1:37:38] hoped for.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; I have something. because we walk by
[1:37:42] faith not by sight.
[1:37:45] So there's a far greater than these five
[1:37:48] physical senses
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; and then we use the five senses to the
[1:37:53] spirit band
[1:37:57] and I remember brother Biscoll said it
[1:37:59] and he said it's a I use an abbreviation
[1:38:02] everyone wants to use my car m I c a r
[1:38:07] my car memory imagination conscience
[1:38:10] affection and reason okay so you'll have
[1:38:13] that relationship So next time you
[1:38:15] think, what are they? Oh, my car memory.
[1:38:18] So now Satan's going to try to come
[1:38:21] against your memory. Oh, you did this.
[1:38:25] He's going to remind you of what you've
[1:38:26] done wrong.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Does he ever remind you?
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; He anoints your memory of what you've
[1:38:34] done wrong. And he makes you guilty and
[1:38:36] say you're not worthy and and this and
[1:38:39] that. So you beat yourself down or uses
[1:38:42] your uh conscience. Oh, you know, oh, I
[1:38:47] I don't know if I was a real I wouldn't
[1:38:49] have done. And so you got this battle in
[1:38:53] the mind. We're going to go and we'll
[1:38:56] talk about each one of those gates. But
[1:38:58] I think one of the ones that Satan likes
[1:39:00] to use the most is the channel of
[1:39:02] reasoning and imagination.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. So I'm not going to get into that
[1:39:09] right now. James 1 verse4-15
[1:39:14] it says, "But every man is temp but
[1:39:18] every man is tempted when he is drawn
[1:39:20] away of the devil."
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Come on, get the get the scripture up
[1:39:28] here.
[1:39:31] I want you guys to see it. Do we have it
[1:39:33] there?
[1:39:35] James 1 14-15. Every man is tempted when
[1:39:40] he is drawn away of his own lust.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; This is self-inflicted.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; When a man is tempted,
[1:39:52] I felt such an anointing.
[1:39:55] Okay. He's drawn away of his own lust.
[1:39:58] The devil had nothing to do with. He's
[1:40:00] sitting back there. You did it to
[1:40:02] yourself. You went to that website. You
[1:40:04] went over there and you started looking.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Like I had a brother with me, young
[1:40:09] brother in Flagstaff. We were sitting
[1:40:10] there in the ch in the in in the car and
[1:40:13] we come to a red light there. There was
[1:40:16] a woman walking across the street and uh
[1:40:19] and she was very immorally dressed. Very
[1:40:21] immoral.
[1:40:23] And he said, "Why look at that Jezebel?
[1:40:26] Look at" and he began I said, "Stop.
[1:40:29] You're lusting."
[1:40:32] H look at this. Oh, stop it.
[1:40:36] I said, brother Ram said, when an
[1:40:38] immoral woman walks in, he says, what do
[1:40:41] you do, brothers?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Turn your head.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Look to the cross. That's why he said
[1:40:46] you should keep a cross on your rearview
[1:40:47] mirror.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Look to the cross. Look to Calvary.
[1:40:52] Every man when he is tempted, he's drawn
[1:40:54] away of his own lust. And when lust hath
[1:40:56] conceived,
[1:40:58] it bringeth forth sin. and sin when it's
[1:41:01] finished bringeth forth death.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Only by the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:41:08] will a man be able to overcome the flesh
[1:41:10] and bring it into subjection.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; But how do we do it? There must be an
[1:41:16] answer.
[1:41:18] The only way for you keep under
[1:41:20] subjection your body is to crucify the
[1:41:23] flesh.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to crucify the flesh?
[1:41:26] Paul said, "I die daily." Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll look at this. It's called
[1:41:32] death to self. Now, death to self is
[1:41:35] actually
[1:41:37] death to yourself will not my will,
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; thine be done.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; So, it's death to self like the children
[1:41:46] of Israel came out of Egypt. God got
[1:41:49] them out of Egypt, but Egypt was still
[1:41:51] in them.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; You can come out of the world, but is
[1:41:55] the world out of you?
[1:42:00] Because they started when temptations
[1:42:04] and trials come, they wanted they they
[1:42:07] wanted the leaks and garlics. Oh, I
[1:42:09] remember. We had it better back then.
[1:42:13] They turned their backs and forgotten
[1:42:14] the whip of the task masters. They died
[1:42:17] in the wilderness and never crossed over
[1:42:19] Jordan. Now watch, Brother Bram said
[1:42:21] this in the breach. Now you went out to
[1:42:25] him. He couldn't get into you because
[1:42:27] the only way he'd get you into you is
[1:42:30] come through the same process that you
[1:42:33] have. He'd have to be saved, sanctified,
[1:42:36] filled with the Holy Ghost. Then he'd be
[1:42:38] your brother. See, now you just went to
[1:42:41] the borderline and come back lusting for
[1:42:44] the things of the world. He never went
[1:42:46] all the way over into Canaan. You see,
[1:42:50] across Jordan and what is Jordan? Death
[1:42:53] to self. That's right.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Do you see what sanctification is?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; It's death to self.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think it's wrong to wear
[1:43:03] an immoral dress.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Doesn't really convict me. You know, I
[1:43:08] don't really see that my wearing men's
[1:43:12] pants is an abomination.
[1:43:15] Well, wait a second. Is this
[1:43:19] is this your will?
[1:43:21] Or are you in love with God enough that
[1:43:24] you say not my will thine be done.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; So death to self is when you cross
[1:43:34] Jordan and say okay Lord. Okay. One of
[1:43:38] the hardest things for me to overcome as
[1:43:40] a young man when I came to the Lord is
[1:43:43] to cut my hair.
[1:43:46] I told my dad I'm going to walk on it
[1:43:48] before I cut it again. Okay. you
[1:43:50] longhaired hippie. Well, hey, I I hated
[1:43:55] getting my haircut as a kid. I hated it
[1:43:58] because you son, you going in there, get
[1:44:00] in there, get get your hair cut. I'll
[1:44:03] tell you what, I went to the racetrack.
[1:44:04] My father was a jockey and back then all
[1:44:07] of those rednecks on the racetrack and
[1:44:09] hair started growing long. Hey, Mel, is
[1:44:11] that your girls you got with you there
[1:44:13] today?
[1:44:14] And my dad
[1:44:16] to you. He says, "I hope one of these
[1:44:19] one of these men come over and they take
[1:44:20] some horse clippers and they just clip
[1:44:22] your hair." You know, I told him, I
[1:44:24] said, "Dad, if they do, I'll kill them."
[1:44:28] I meant it, too. I was so rebellious.
[1:44:31] See, it's a rebellious spirit.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; The rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Like caught the snake.
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:45] I guess it's not so bad. No. Do you
[1:44:48] understand?
[1:44:51] The crossing over Jordan is actually
[1:44:54] death. Some of you guys are laughing.
[1:44:56] It's so good.
[1:44:59] It's death to self.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; If you love me,
[1:45:05] you keep my commitment.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[1:45:09] most of the time, people have just
[1:45:12] enough of God to be miserable,
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:17] Just enough.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you a quote.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in the eagle in her
[1:45:28] nest.
[1:45:33] You know, a chicken is a bird just the
[1:45:35] same as the eagle is,
[1:45:38] but he's an earthbound creature. Oh, he
[1:45:41] can flop and fly a little bit.
[1:45:43] He can hardly get his feet off the
[1:45:45] ground. It reminds me of some of those
[1:45:47] so-called Christianity we got today.
[1:45:51] Just enough religion to make you
[1:45:53] miserable.
[1:45:56] You ever seen somebody miserable going
[1:45:58] to church? Do we have to?
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; In separation from unbelief. Ahab was a
[1:46:06] borderline believer.
[1:46:08] Just a fellow that believed enough to
[1:46:10] make him miserable. Did you ever see
[1:46:12] people like that?
[1:46:15] Well,
[1:46:16] they have conception that they would
[1:46:19] like to go to church and do right. They
[1:46:21] feel like it might make them a better
[1:46:23] social person in their social lives. And
[1:46:26] maybe for the sake of their children,
[1:46:27] they think they ought to or maybe belong
[1:46:29] to church. If that isn't the most
[1:46:32] miserable person I know of, I tell you
[1:46:36] the best
[1:46:38] that the best of cut loose all
[1:46:41] shorelines and launch out into the deep
[1:46:43] or don't go at all.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Ouch.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Just simply stay home.
[1:46:56] Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Or either go all the way for Christ.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; All the way. I'm going all the way. Huh?
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Miserable.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; They have just enough of God to be
[1:47:12] miserable,
[1:47:14] but they won't go all the way.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; So he says, God wants somebody who will
[1:47:19] really go all the way. give you all you
[1:47:22] got, soul, body, and spirit to the
[1:47:24] service of the Lord.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:47:30] Paul tells, "I have a war within my
[1:47:32] members." Remember Paul had a way of
[1:47:35] being religious, right? He said, "I was
[1:47:37] a Hebrew of Hebrews, a Pharisee of
[1:47:39] Pharisees.
[1:47:40] I had zeal persecuting the church."
[1:47:43] You know, he goes on and he said, "If
[1:47:45] anyone has something to boast, I the
[1:47:47] more
[1:47:49] circumcised the eighth day children of
[1:47:51] Israel." And he goes on and on. Boast,
[1:47:52] boast, boast.
[1:47:55] Paul know what Paul knew what it was
[1:47:57] like to be religious.
[1:47:59] And concerning the law, blameless,
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; So now he doesn't have a relationship
[1:48:05] with God. So God meets him on the road
[1:48:08] to Damascus.
[1:48:10] And there's where we had read where he
[1:48:12] was telling King Agrippa.
[1:48:14] But you see him being a Pharisee, a
[1:48:17] Pharisee means actor. Do you guys know
[1:48:19] that?
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Pharisee means actor.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; And some people are so such good
[1:48:23] Pharisees in the church. They're actors.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I'm a believer. Yes, I sing the
[1:48:29] songs. Yes, I believe he's a prophet.
[1:48:31] You actor.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; You can tell by your life.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; You're not living what he tells us to
[1:48:37] do. You call him prophet, but don't do
[1:48:39] what he does he tells you to do.
[1:48:44] You're not made holy by the dress you
[1:48:46] wear.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; You're not made holy by the law you
[1:48:51] keep.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; You're not holy because you believe the
[1:48:55] truth.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; You're only holy because you have faith
[1:48:59] in God. And God imputes unto you
[1:49:02] righteousness.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Even against our own better judgment,
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; God still loved me.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; If, listen, let's be honest. If you had
[1:49:18] to choose yourself to be the bride of
[1:49:20] Jesus Christ in this hour, would have
[1:49:22] you chose yourself?
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; You'd have said, "Are you kidding me?"
[1:49:30] You'd laugh.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Who me? Yeah. No, not me. I got too many
[1:49:35] problem. I got I got all kinds of
[1:49:37] complexes. Yeah, but God chose the weak
[1:49:39] to confound the
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; wise.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Has God not chosen the foolish things of
[1:49:46] this world
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; to confound the wise? Look at you. Paul
[1:49:49] said, "Look among you as any are any big
[1:49:52] governors or rulers of Nah. We're a
[1:49:56] bunch of no names."
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Look at us. God has chosen us.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. to make foolish the wisdom of this
[1:50:06] world.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:50:10] God met
[1:50:14] Paul on the road to Damascus. Okay, let
[1:50:16] me bring this to a a close here and read
[1:50:19] the scripture. Romans 7 17-2. And you
[1:50:24] know what? I'm going to have you uh
[1:50:25] brother Mark
[1:50:28] read Romans chapter 7.
[1:50:32] Romans 7.
[1:50:34] verses 17 through 25. Now, now we're
[1:50:38] going to show you Paul says, "I got a
[1:50:42] problem.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; When I try to do good,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; evil is present with me. And that which
[1:50:49] I want to do, I don't do.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; That which I don't want to do, that I
[1:50:54] do."
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Any of you say amen to that?
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; I've done it many times.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I wanted to do right, I didn't.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; And that which I didn't want to do, that
[1:51:02] I did. So go ahead, brother Martin.
[1:51:06] Romans 7 verse1 17.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Now then it is no more I that do it, but
[1:51:11] sin that dwelleth in me.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Wow. It's not me, it's sin.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; For I know that in me that is in my
[1:51:18] flesh.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; In my flesh.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, Mark.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Dwelleth no good thing. For to will is
[1:51:26] present with me. But how to perform that
[1:51:28] which is good I find not.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Wow. For the good that I would, I do
[1:51:33] not, but the evil which I would not,
[1:51:35] that I do. Now, if I do that, I would
[1:51:38] not, it is no more I that do it, but sin
[1:51:40] that dwelleth in me.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Look at that.
[1:51:43] I find then a law that when I would do
[1:51:45] good, evil is present with me. For I
[1:51:48] delight in the law of God after the
[1:51:50] inward man.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; The inward man. I delight after the law
[1:51:53] of God after the inward man, not the
[1:51:56] flesh man.
[1:51:58] But I see another law in my members,
[1:52:01] waring against the law of my mind and
[1:52:03] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[1:52:05] sin which is in my members. Oh wretched
[1:52:08] man that I am. Who shall deliver me from
[1:52:10] the body of this death? I thank God
[1:52:12] through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then
[1:52:15] with the mind I myself serve the law of
[1:52:17] God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
[1:52:20] So then with the mind
[1:52:25] I myself serve the law of God, but with
[1:52:27] the flesh,
[1:52:30] the law of sin.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, wretched, vile man that I am. Paul
[1:52:36] said he was the chiefest of sinners.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Do you think he was lying? You know, the
[1:52:41] thing that I love about Paul, Paul
[1:52:43] doesn't go in and expound in all the
[1:52:45] things that he did wrong. He didn't say,
[1:52:47] "Well, I I was a drinker drunkard. I ran
[1:52:49] with women. I was this and that and on
[1:52:51] on. He doesn't He doesn't tell us
[1:52:53] anything. I like it when a man can get
[1:52:56] up and give his testimony. He doesn't
[1:52:57] have to go back through all, well, I'll
[1:52:59] tell you what. I I did this and I did
[1:53:01] that. No. Hey, no. I don't even want to
[1:53:03] give Satan the glory.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Just say, I was the chiefest of sinners.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; End of story.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; He's not lying.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; He had a religious spirit.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; He even persecuted the church. He killed
[1:53:17] Christians.
[1:53:18] He even held the the coat of those that
[1:53:21] were stoning Stephen. He saw and brother
[1:53:24] Brennham said Paul saw them stone
[1:53:28] Stephen, the first martyr in the New
[1:53:31] Testament.
[1:53:33] They saw he saw them stone Stephen and
[1:53:37] he held their jackets while they threw
[1:53:39] the stones and they saw him he saw
[1:53:46] Stephen die.
[1:53:48] And it so affected him
[1:53:52] that the rest of his life he can't get
[1:53:54] away from it.
[1:53:56] And he desired to be martyed.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; He said if somebody
[1:54:03] can give their life like that,
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; what about me?
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:11] Even
[1:54:12] when
[1:54:14] who was it that took the girdle
[1:54:18] of Paul?
[1:54:20] He prophesied you're going to go to
[1:54:22] Rome, you're going to be Who was it?
[1:54:25] Huh? Say it.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Agabus. Thank you. Sometimes the harder
[1:54:33] I chase it.
[1:54:35] So Agabus, he he took the girdle of
[1:54:38] Paul. And he said, "Thus sayaith the
[1:54:40] Lord, he that wears this shall be bound
[1:54:44] and trouble will find him in in Rome or
[1:54:48] in wherever it was he was going." He
[1:54:50] said, "Don't break my heart. I'm more
[1:54:52] than willing
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; to go and suffer for the cause of
[1:54:55] Christ."
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Now, so you know, there must be a death
[1:55:00] to self. Are we all aware of that? When
[1:55:03] Jesus bids you to come, he bids you come
[1:55:05] and die. For he who seeks to lose his
[1:55:08] life shall find it. But he who seeks to
[1:55:11] save his life will lose it.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; There is a cost to disciplehip.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; You have to give your life to him.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; And the only way to get him on the
[1:55:22] control room is a death to self,
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; self-will, either faith or doubt.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; And when you have faith and say, "Come
[1:55:29] into my heart, Lord Jesus." He comes in.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; And guess what? You're born again. and
[1:55:34] you're conceived of God and now you
[1:55:37] become a new creature in Christ, but now
[1:55:39] you're a babe in Christ.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Now, Galatians 2
[1:55:45] and 20. And musicians, if you've come,
[1:55:47] because we're going to go directly into
[1:55:49] communion here, and I I I trust I that
[1:55:52] this was a blessing to you. I I didn't
[1:55:55] plan on preaching tonight,
[1:55:58] but I just sat down and I looked at
[1:56:00] something. I said, "You know what? A
[1:56:02] couple things. I'll just say a couple
[1:56:03] things.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Galatians 2 and 20.
[1:56:09] I am crucified with Christ.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I live.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; How can you be crucified and live?
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. What
[1:56:24] is Christ? The anointing.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Christ is the anointing. The anointed
[1:56:30] word liveth in me.
[1:56:33] I show you a mystery. It's no longer I
[1:56:35] that live, but Christ liveth in me.
[1:56:40] And the life which I now live in the
[1:56:43] flesh, I live by the faith of the son of
[1:56:46] God
[1:56:48] who loved me and gave himself for me.
[1:56:50] Galatians 5 and 24. And they that are
[1:56:53] Christ Christs
[1:56:56] have crucified the flesh with the
[1:56:58] affections and the lust. And Galatians
[1:57:02] 6:14 says, "But God forbid that I should
[1:57:05] glory save in the cross of our Lord
[1:57:08] Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
[1:57:11] crucified unto me,
[1:57:14] and I unto the world."
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:18] [Music]
[1:57:21] There's where
[1:57:25] many people miss
[1:57:28] that place where the seed is germatized
[1:57:32] inside of them because they only come so
[1:57:36] far.
[1:57:38] Brother Bram said that
[1:57:41] denomination
[1:57:42] people are satisfied with just
[1:57:45] justification.
[1:57:47] They're satisfied with a little bit of
[1:57:50] sanctification.
[1:57:52] They're religious. They light candles.
[1:57:54] They recite prayers. They're told that
[1:57:57] that's all you need to do. Our Father,
[1:58:00] who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[1:58:05] Or say the one to Hail Mary, mother of
[1:58:09] God.
[1:58:11] And just say prayers and say repetition.
[1:58:17] Jesus said, "Call no man your father."
[1:58:22] And yet, how many millions of the people
[1:58:25] in the world are deceived
[1:58:28] by a religious way? They have a form of
[1:58:32] godliness,
[1:58:34] but deny the very power thereof.
[1:58:38] God, I don't want a form of religion. I
[1:58:42] don't want this message to become the
[1:58:45] Amish,
[1:58:47] the Menanites,
[1:58:50] the people that isolate themselves and
[1:58:53] they just horse and buggy and they want
[1:58:55] to go back to the old ways and if we're
[1:58:59] not careful that that's what we do.
[1:59:03] You kids, you're going to the girls,
[1:59:06] you're going to wear a dress. The boys,
[1:59:07] you're going to do this. Boys, you're
[1:59:09] going to cut your hair. You're not going
[1:59:10] to wear shorts and on and on and next
[1:59:13] thing you know. Yes. Okay. Yes. And but
[1:59:16] the Bible says be not conformed
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:59:21] what?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Your mind.
[1:59:25] The power of transformation
[1:59:28] is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:59:31] personally and it transforms you from
[1:59:34] being a conforming Christian
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; to a transformed believer and
[1:59:43] then then
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; you're different. You talk different.
[1:59:47] You walk different.
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:52] Some of these things that you teach,
[1:59:54] they may seem so very simple, but how
[1:59:57] many of the people within the message
[2:00:00] don't have a clue
[2:00:03] [Music]
[2:00:04] of brother Brenam's teaching.
[2:00:07] He said though
[2:00:10] you can understand all the mysteries
[2:00:11] like Paul give your body to be burnt
[2:00:17] all of those things and have not love
[2:00:22] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol
[2:00:26] you don't have it because God is love
[2:00:30] the capstone
[2:00:33] the capstone
[2:00:36] the stature of a perfect Amen. This is
[2:00:38] the very headship, the very mind of God.
[2:00:41] And brother Rem said, "That's love."
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; I fell in love with Jesus Christ years
[2:00:47] ago.
[2:00:49] I'll never forget. I was probably a boy
[2:00:51] of about 8 years old. Went to a place
[2:00:54] called
[2:00:56] um
[2:00:58] Green Oak Ranch Boys Camp.
[2:01:02] Never been to a Never
[2:01:05] Jesus Christ. never heard these things.
[2:01:09] Never had anybody read the Bible
[2:01:13] and
[2:01:15] went to this religious camp and they had
[2:01:19] a little train and I was mesmerized by
[2:01:22] this little choo choo train and they had
[2:01:24] an engineer with an engineer cap and
[2:01:27] everything and kids the only way that
[2:01:29] you could ride the train was you had to
[2:01:32] memorize a verse.
[2:01:35] Oh,
[2:01:38] good grief. I got to memorize a verse
[2:01:40] first to get on the train. Yeah. So,
[2:01:41] they gave me a little thing. Romans 5'8.
[2:01:43] First Bible verse I ever me ever. Romans
[2:01:47] 5'8. But God commendeth his love toward
[2:01:49] us.
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; That while we were yet sinners,
[2:02:01] Christ died for us.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:05] I rode the train.
[2:02:07] I memorized the verse. I've never forgot
[2:02:11] it. The next verse was John 3:16.
[2:02:15] For God so loved the world,
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:24] he gave his only begotten son
[2:02:28] that whosoever believeth in him should
[2:02:31] not perish
[2:02:33] but have everlasting life.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; I fell in love with him.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; What's the name of this song with it?
[2:02:42] Huh? Be it unto me. Be it unto
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Let's stand for a minute. Change your
[2:02:49] position.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; According
[2:02:53] to thy word.
[2:02:58] According to thy promises
[2:03:05] I can stand
[2:03:08] secure.
[2:03:11] Harve upon my heart.
[2:03:17] The truth that sets me free.
[2:03:24] According to thy thy word, oh Lord,
[2:03:31] be it unto
[2:03:34] me.
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:42] Brother Mark, would you read 1
[2:03:43] Corinthians chapter 11 for me?
[2:03:49] [Music]
[2:03:52] Because
[2:03:54] here it is, the night of his betrayal.
[2:04:00] It's called the last supper.
[2:04:05] He's having communion before he goes off
[2:04:08] the scene.
[2:04:11] Do you think it's coincidence that the
[2:04:12] last sermon Brother Bran preaches
[2:04:16] communion before he goes off the scene?
[2:04:22] The very example of Christ in this hour
[2:04:27] preaches communion.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Goes off the scene.
[2:04:32] 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23.
[2:04:38] Go ahead.
[2:04:42] For I have received of the Lord that
[2:04:44] which also I delivered unto you, that
[2:04:47] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[2:04:49] he was betrayed, took bread, and when he
[2:04:51] had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[2:04:54] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[2:04:56] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[2:04:58] of me."
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Play very softly. Good. Just a couple
[2:05:01] notes just softly softly. After the same
[2:05:04] manner also he took the cup when he had
[2:05:07] sucked, saying, "This cup is the new
[2:05:08] testament in my blood. This do ye as
[2:05:12] often we you drink it in remembrance of
[2:05:14] me. For as often as you eat this bread
[2:05:17] and drink this cup, you do show the
[2:05:19] Lord's death till he come."
[2:05:22] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[2:05:24] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:05:26] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:05:28] and blood of the Lord. But let a man
[2:05:30] examine himself.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Let a man examine himself.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; And so let him eat of that bread and
[2:05:36] drink of that cup. For he that eateth
[2:05:38] and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and
[2:05:40] drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[2:05:42] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[2:05:45] cause many are weak and sickly among
[2:05:47] you. And many sleep.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Why are there many sick and
[2:05:53] many sleep?
[2:05:55] Because they are not discerning
[2:05:57] the Lord's body. Go ahead.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; But if we would judge ourselves, we
[2:06:02] should not be judged. But when we are
[2:06:04] judged, we are chasened of the Lord,
[2:06:06] that we should not be condemned with the
[2:06:08] world. Wherefore, my brethren, when we
[2:06:10] come together to eat, tar one for
[2:06:12] another, and if any man hunger, let him
[2:06:14] eat at home, that you come not together
[2:06:17] under condemnation, and the rest will I
[2:06:19] set in order when I come.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. If my deacon brethren
[2:06:24] or the brethren that are going to help
[2:06:26] serve the communion tonight, will they
[2:06:29] come forward here?
[2:06:31] Can you imagine Jesus sitting there
[2:06:35] with them and he said,
[2:06:39] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[2:06:41] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[2:06:44] of me.
[2:06:47] Take of this bread and drink of this
[2:06:50] cup. For in doing so, you'll do this in
[2:06:55] remembrance of me.
[2:07:03] So, here we are tonight judging
[2:07:06] ourselves.
[2:07:09] You judge yourself.
[2:07:14] And if you judge yourself, you made a
[2:07:16] mistake,
[2:07:18] confess it right now. Tell God, I'm
[2:07:21] sorry.
[2:07:23] There's none of us perfect. None of us
[2:07:25] that can say even all last week, I did
[2:07:27] everything right. No,
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; you know what? We're all failures.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; But through Christ, I can do all things.
[2:07:34] I am more than an overcomer.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; So, because of his blood, I can say,
[2:07:39] Lord, I'm sorry. Put it under the blood.
[2:07:41] And guess what? I have a right to come
[2:07:42] up here and partake of it.
[2:07:45] And so
[2:08:00] would you hold that?
[2:08:03] Would you bow your heads now as I break
[2:08:05] the bread? Heavenly Father,
[2:08:09] I break this bread.
[2:08:12] we do
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; in remembrance of you.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; For you said, if we would break the
[2:08:18] bread
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; that it would be a symbol,
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; this is not your body. It is only a
[2:08:24] symbol. So let a man eat of that bread
[2:08:28] and drink of that cup.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Father, I ask a blessing upon this bread
[2:08:33] and those that partake of it this
[2:08:35] evening. May there be healings,
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; revelations, manifestations in lives.
[2:08:42] lives brought closer to you and in
[2:08:44] greater love with you. I thank you. I
[2:08:47] praise you. I bless this bread in Jesus
[2:08:50] name. Amen. All right, go ahead and take
[2:08:54] the lid off that there. Brother Mike,
[2:08:56] I'm not going to raise these up, but
[2:08:58] I'll just lay my hands on bow your heads
[2:09:00] again. Heavenly Father,
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, here in these canisters and these
[2:09:06] little couplets
[2:09:08] are a symbol of your life's blood. It's
[2:09:11] the wine.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Wine has life in it just as blood has
[2:09:16] life.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; So, Father, I I bless this wine. I ask
[2:09:21] you let those that drink of it
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; right now.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, let the scenes of
[2:09:28] Calvary come before him. And thank you
[2:09:30] for the blood which cleanses us from all
[2:09:33] sin.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Bless those that partake tonight. I ask
[2:09:36] in Jesus Christ's name
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; and for his glory.
[2:09:41] Amen.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's some of you that have
[2:09:44] never been here during a communion
[2:09:46] service, you may be seated.
[2:09:49] You go ahead and be seated right now.
[2:09:51] All of you. And you wait for a deacon to
[2:09:54] dismiss you and we'll come you know each
[2:09:58] side will come and then you'll go out
[2:10:01] and just follow who's before you. Amen.
[2:10:04] Brother Chris, if you would come up here
[2:10:08] and let's go ahead and put some music on
[2:10:10] there. Brother Matthew.

[2:25:31] Thank you, brethren.
[2:25:35] St. John chapter 13.
[2:25:44] These glasses I wear, they were on my
[2:25:47] desk for the past five years.
[2:25:51] Somebody left them in the church.
[2:25:54] So if they look like your glasses, I
[2:25:56] have claimed them. But they work
[2:25:59] perfect.
[2:26:06] Now before the feast of the Passover,
[2:26:09] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[2:26:13] that he should depart out of this world
[2:26:16] unto the Father, having loved his own
[2:26:20] which were in the world,
[2:26:22] he loved them unto the end.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And supper being ended,
[2:26:31] the devil having now put into the heart,
[2:26:34] see it was in his mind for a long time,
[2:26:37] but now he went from his mind to his
[2:26:39] heart. And the devil having now put into
[2:26:42] the heart of Judas's scariot, Simon's
[2:26:45] son, to betray him.
[2:26:48] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:26:50] all things into his hands
[2:26:53] and that he was come from God
[2:26:56] and went to God. He riseth from supper
[2:26:59] and laid aside his garments and took a
[2:27:01] towel and girded himself.
[2:27:04] And after that he pth water into a basin
[2:27:06] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[2:27:09] to wipe them with a towel wherewith he
[2:27:11] was girded.
[2:27:13] Then cometh he to Simon Peter.
[2:27:16] And Peter saith unto him, Lord, dust
[2:27:20] thou wash my feet? And Jesus answered
[2:27:23] and said unto him, "What I do, thou
[2:27:25] knowest not now, but thou shalt know
[2:27:28] hereafter?" Peter saith unto him, "Thou
[2:27:31] shalt never wash my feet." And Jesus
[2:27:34] answered him, "If I wash thee not,
[2:27:38] thou has no part with me." Simon Peter
[2:27:41] saith unto him, Lord,
[2:27:44] not my feet only,
[2:27:49] also my hands and my head. And Jesus
[2:27:53] saith to him, he that is washed needeth
[2:27:55] not to save to wash his feet, but is
[2:27:59] clean ever wit.
[2:28:01] Ye are clean,
[2:28:03] but not all. For he knew who should
[2:28:06] betray him. Therefore said he, you are
[2:28:09] not all clean. So after he had washed
[2:28:12] their feet, and had taken his garments,
[2:28:14] and was set down again, he said unto
[2:28:16] them, "Know ye what I have done to you?
[2:28:20] You call me Master and Lord, and ye say,
[2:28:22] well,
[2:28:24] for so I am.
[2:28:26] If I then, your Lord and Master, have
[2:28:29] washed your feet, you ye also ought to
[2:28:31] wash one another's feet. For I have
[2:28:33] given you an example that you should do
[2:28:35] as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I
[2:28:38] say unto you, the servant is not greater
[2:28:40] than his lord, neither he that sent
[2:28:43] greater than he that sent him. If you
[2:28:46] know these things, happy
[2:28:50] are ye if you do them.
[2:28:56] I speak not of you all,
[2:29:00] I know whom I have chosen, but that the
[2:29:03] scripture might be fulfilled. He that
[2:29:04] eateth bread with me hath lifted up his
[2:29:08] head against me. My
[2:29:13] we are going to partake now of foot
[2:29:15] washing. Again, this is one of the
[2:29:18] ordinances that we do. He said, I've
[2:29:20] done an example. Do you think that you
[2:29:23] are greater than your Lord? That you
[2:29:25] shouldn't do it that well, I'll just
[2:29:28] pass it up. You know, whatever excuse.
[2:29:30] No, I've done unto you as an example
[2:29:34] that you might do unto others. So, we do
[2:29:37] that. And sisters, if you would be
[2:29:39] dismissed now, you'll go ahead and go
[2:29:41] through these doors and go off to the
[2:29:43] side here. We'll dismiss. And and
[2:29:45] brother Matt, if you just want to play
[2:29:47] some music and you, brethren, you stay
[2:29:49] here and we'll wait until most of the
[2:29:51] sisters are out of the sanctuary and
[2:29:54] then we'll wash one another's feet.

[3:08:32] upon all flesh."
[3:08:34] &gt;&gt; Your sons and daughters shall prophesy.
[3:08:37] &gt;&gt; Your young men shall see visions and

[3:09:47] [Applause]
[3:09:50] Lord, I seek you.
[3:09:54] Help me find you.
[3:09:58] How I need your love.
[3:10:04] [Music]
[3:10:05] I might cry and
[3:10:09] broken pieces
[3:10:14] before your love.
[3:10:21] Lord, forgive me
[3:10:24] if I want
[3:10:28] far away from you.
[3:10:36] You are all I
[3:10:40] ever needed.
[3:10:44] Come and make me
[3:10:46] [Music]
[3:10:49] pour your spirit out on me.
[3:10:54] Long as I pray the rain
[3:10:59] saturate
[3:11:02] my thirsty soul
[3:11:06] and call a friend on me.
[3:11:09] Fill my cup again.
[3:11:14] Heal my heart
[3:11:17] and make me home.
[3:11:22] I need you now
[3:11:26] pour your spirit
[3:11:29] out.
[3:11:32] [Music]
[3:11:38] &gt;&gt; Fall aresh
[3:11:44] [Music]
[3:11:46] &gt;&gt; fall aresh.
[3:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:49] &gt;&gt; Saturate. Yes.
[3:11:51] &gt;&gt; You know what saturation mean?
[3:11:55] &gt;&gt; Every fiber
[3:11:57] &gt;&gt; of your being.
[3:11:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:01] &gt;&gt; Saturated.
[3:12:03] &gt;&gt; I don't want just a dip. I want a
[3:12:05] saturation.
[3:12:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Oh,
[3:12:16] &gt;&gt; I sure love and appreciate each and
[3:12:19] every one of you.
[3:12:22] &gt;&gt; I do.
[3:12:24] &gt;&gt; I love you, too.
[3:12:28] One of these days,
[3:12:31] by God's grace and his mercy, we'll
[3:12:35] cross over together.
[3:12:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. will possess every gate.
[3:12:45] &gt;&gt; We'll claim every promise.
[3:12:49] &gt;&gt; And I trust that everyone here
[3:12:52] &gt;&gt; will hear those words from our Lord and
[3:12:55] Savior.
[3:12:56] &gt;&gt; Enter in,
[3:12:58] &gt;&gt; my good and faithful servant.
[3:13:00] &gt;&gt; Enter now into the joys
[3:13:04] &gt;&gt; of the Lord.
[3:13:06] &gt;&gt; He's coming soon, saints.
[3:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:09] &gt;&gt; He sent his messenger.
[3:13:12] He was sent of God that he might prepare
[3:13:14] a people.
[3:13:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "I believe my commission is to
[3:13:19] go get a bride ready
[3:13:21] &gt;&gt; to tell her."
[3:13:27] &gt;&gt; He's come.
[3:13:29] &gt;&gt; He's preached his message.
[3:13:31] &gt;&gt; But there's more people
[3:13:34] believing this message now than there
[3:13:37] was when he preached it.
[3:13:41] No wonder God had to have him go beyond
[3:13:43] the curtain of time.
[3:13:45] &gt;&gt; There wasn't all these churches, evening
[3:13:48] fellowship and end time tabernacle and
[3:13:50] on and on and on. They wasn't a bunch of
[3:13:53] message believing churches. There were
[3:13:55] just one or two here that kind of knew
[3:13:57] he had a special gift.
[3:14:00] [Music]
[3:14:05] Then he goes off of the scene
[3:14:08] and all these years later
[3:14:13] &gt;&gt; look at us.
[3:14:16] &gt;&gt; He is still he is still calling his
[3:14:19] elect.
[3:14:22] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send unto you Elijah.
[3:14:27] &gt;&gt; I receive it, Lord.
[3:14:30] &gt;&gt; I thank you, Father. You love me so much
[3:14:32] you sent me a personal messenger.
[3:14:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:14:36] &gt;&gt; That he come into Laa and he preached a
[3:14:38] message and
[3:14:40] &gt;&gt; you even rebuked him for calling
[3:14:44] me one of those
[3:14:46] &gt;&gt; Rickys and Ricettas. Huh?
[3:14:48] &gt;&gt; I was one of them.
[3:14:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Stop calling them that."
[3:14:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "There's some of those are your
[3:14:55] are my seed."
[3:14:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:14:58] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[3:14:59] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[3:14:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:15:00] I was a Ricky out there, not knowing.
[3:15:03] Huh? And then one day, I heard this
[3:15:05] message.
[3:15:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:15:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:15:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:15:10] &gt;&gt; It wasn't William Brandom I heard.
[3:15:14] &gt;&gt; I heard the voice behind the veil.
[3:15:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[3:15:30] Thank you for your love.
[3:15:36] &gt;&gt; Give me the key to I love him.
[3:15:40] And we'll sing this. This will be our
[3:15:42] last song.
[3:15:46] Let this song be a testimony.
[3:15:50] Tell him.
[3:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:54] &gt;&gt; Say it and sing it to him.
[3:15:58] Oh, I
[3:16:02] love him.
[3:16:06] I
[3:16:09] love him
[3:16:13] because
[3:16:15] he first
[3:16:19] love me
[3:16:21] [Music]

[3:16:28] is my
[3:16:31] salvation.

[3:16:40] [Music]
[3:16:42] &gt;&gt; Now let's sing in a capella just with
[3:16:44] our voices.
[3:16:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I
[3:16:51] love him.
[3:16:55] I
[3:16:58] love him
[3:17:02] because

[3:17:26] on Cal.
[3:17:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[3:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[3:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Take a moment, shake somebody's
[3:17:41] hand. Jesus said, "They shall know that
[3:17:44] you are my disciples
[3:17:47] because you all believe the same
[3:17:49] doctrine." because you all go to the
[3:17:51] same church, because you all dress
[3:17:52] alike. He said, "Because you have love
[3:17:55] one for another." Brother Brennham said,
[3:17:57] "God would rather you love one another
[3:18:00] than to love him because in loving one
[3:18:03] another, you love him."
[3:18:05] &gt;&gt; Get the hug. Make sure I hug you.
[3:18:07] &gt;&gt; What's that?
[3:18:07] &gt;&gt; I just want to make sure I hug you.
[3:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, God bless you. Amen. God bless you.
[3:18:12] Let's consider ourselves dismissed.
[3:18:15] Go in peace. Love one another. Most of
[3:18:19] all love him.
[3:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18:21] &gt;&gt; Serve him
[3:18:23] with all your heart.
[3:18:26] Go in peace. You are dismissed in Jesus
[3:18:28] name.
[3:18:32] [Music]
[3:19:07] Oh,
[3:19:13] [Music]
