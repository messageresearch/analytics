[6:55] I actually don't have any written
[6:58] requests tonight but I know there's many
[7:00] needs on the people's hearts we are
[7:02] needy people I just want to bring this
[7:05] these needs before the church just
[7:08] jotting some of these down I just
[7:09] remember brother Ron I think he's
[7:10] returning this Friday
[7:12] and we just want to pray for traveling
[7:14] mercies and just to give him strength
[7:16] and then he has a easy trip home but no
[7:18] delays
[7:19] I know our sister Melody Whedon is still
[7:22] um recovering I believe from her surgery
[7:24] so let's keep her in prayer and then of
[7:27] course our sister Nancy Tempe
[7:29] going through her chemotherapy too I
[7:32] believe and I know it's tough on her so
[7:35] let's keep her lifted in prayer and also
[7:37] brother John and sister Sharman just
[7:39] been on our heart they've lost their
[7:41] their home and the fire and I'm just
[7:44] trying to put myself in their shoes this
[7:46] last week and
[7:48] it'd be tough
[7:49] it's a pretty tough road to walk and
[7:52] I can't say that I know how they feel
[7:53] but
[7:54] I could say that we need to lift him in
[7:56] prayer
[7:57] God is able and text Brother John and
[8:00] seem to have the right attitude the
[8:01] right Spirit about it all and I just
[8:04] pray God will be their portion

[8:10] that with Theos I took him to
[8:13] first treatment
[8:14] [Music]
[8:17] in his ANC numbers that come up he was
[8:19] able to receive a treatment and we're
[8:21] thankful for that
[8:22] as a blood panel was better
[8:24] his second phase of his treatment he had
[8:26] become quite lethargic and a little bit
[8:28] irritable which is very uncanny for him
[8:30] he normally does really well and very
[8:32] positive actually leads from his
[8:34] treatments with lots of energy we've
[8:35] kitted around what do you put in this
[8:36] stuff you know but he was quite
[8:39] different for him and we took him home
[8:41] and just kind of monitored him he had
[8:43] lost a lot of his um
[8:45] is activity you know the drive to be
[8:48] active at all and so we could noticed he
[8:50] had started running a fever which we
[8:52] monitored and there's a pretty strict
[8:53] protocol to when someone on chemo runs a
[8:56] fever and it after an hour it got worse
[8:58] and so we called and we had to take him
[9:00] actually back into the ER Monday evening
[9:03] about 7 38

[9:24] he'd been diagnosed with a viral
[9:26] respiratory infection so being that he
[9:29] had his treatment and his white blood
[9:30] cell count gets deprivated it was very
[9:32] tough for him and but he was able to be
[9:34] released thankfully that morning about
[9:37] two o'clock we were released from the
[9:39] hospital so he's at home resting
[9:41] and he's his normal little happy self

[31:10] precious name
[31:12] amen amen
[31:14] you love him tonight
[31:16] amen if you have your Bibles
[31:21] you turn to Ecclesiastes 5.
[31:25] yes
[31:26] Ecclesiastes five and we're going to
[31:28] turn to John 14.
[31:38] Ecclesiastes 5 and 1 says
[31:43] keep thy foot when thou goes to the
[31:45] house of God and be more ready to hear
[31:48] than to give the sacrifice of fools
[31:52] for they considered not
[31:55] that they do evil
[31:59] and as I begin to think on this
[32:02] be ready more to hear than give a
[32:04] sacrifice of Fools and
[32:06] the Lord's been dealing with us here and
[32:09] I'm going to keep going but it came to
[32:11] me
[32:12] when I woke up
[32:15] and
[32:16] it came to me that you know as I begin
[32:18] to look and it popped up on my calendar
[32:20] does anybody know what today is
[32:23] it's Ash Wednesday
[32:25] Ash Wednesday people go before
[32:29] the priests and denominations and
[32:31] different religions and you go and you
[32:33] confess your sins and
[32:35] you make promises to and your devotion
[32:39] unto God
[32:41] and it's the first day of Lent and in
[32:42] Lent
[32:43] for the next 40 days
[32:46] they sacrifice something
[32:49] as a representation of what God did in
[32:51] the desert
[32:53] and what the reason this stuck out to me
[32:56] because back in high school I had some
[32:58] buddies
[32:59] and you would ask him what did you
[33:01] sacrifice
[33:02] now I say this with respect because my
[33:05] family my my mom's side of the family is
[33:07] Catholic and
[33:09] they're very devout very sincere
[33:11] Catholics
[33:14] but they would go and they would
[33:15] sacrifice something
[33:18] and I would ask him what did you
[33:20] sacrifice some would give up Facebook
[33:21] for the 40 days
[33:24] some would give up video games
[33:28] and one of my best friends you know what
[33:30] he gave up
[33:31] eating hot Cheetos
[33:34] a sacrifice of fools
[33:38] you see you go and they just what are
[33:41] they living by what is something that
[33:43] they can give up for 40 days to live
[33:45] without
[33:46] Hot Cheetos
[33:50] and I began to ask him how does that
[33:52] apply to your life how does that how
[33:54] does that even work
[33:56] but yet that's just where they're at
[33:58] that's they've grown up as kids giving
[34:00] up something
[34:02] let's go on
[34:06] in verse 2 be not rash with thy mouth
[34:08] and let not thine heart be haste to
[34:10] utter anything before God for God in
[34:12] heaven and thou was upon Earth therefore
[34:15] let thy Words Be Few for a dream cometh
[34:18] through a multitude of business and a
[34:20] Fool's voice is known by a multitude of
[34:22] words
[34:24] and this is our thought tonight when a
[34:26] when thou vow is The Vow unto God
[34:29] defer not to pay it for he that hath no
[34:32] pleasure and fools
[34:34] pay that which thou has vowed
[34:36] better is it that thou should as not vow
[34:40] then thou should as vow and not pay
[34:45] says suffer not thy mouth to cause thy
[34:48] flesh to sin
[34:50] neither say thou before the Angels it
[34:53] was that it was an heir wherefore God
[34:56] should God be angry at that voice and
[34:58] destroy the work of thy hand
[35:00] for in a multitude of Dreams in many
[35:02] words there are also diverse vanities
[35:05] but fear thou God
[35:07] let's turn to St John 14.
[35:10] Saint John 14 verse 1.
[35:13] and it says let not your heart be
[35:15] troubled you believe in me in God
[35:18] believe also in me
[35:19] for in my father's house are many
[35:21] mansions
[35:22] if it were so not so I would have told
[35:25] you
[35:26] I go to prepare a place for you
[35:28] and if I go to prepare a place for you I
[35:31] will come again and receive you unto
[35:34] myself that where I am
[35:36] he may be also you can be seated tonight
[35:43] now I had to call Brother Stephen after
[35:45] Sunday service and get some of my notes
[35:47] back
[35:50] but do you believe that God has a
[35:52] channel
[35:53] that you can tap into that thing
[35:55] sometimes you'll be about your daily
[35:56] life and you can say a prayer and you
[35:58] can maybe read a scripture and sure
[36:00] enough that the minister will begin to
[36:02] preach on those very same things and
[36:05] tonight
[36:06] we would like to talk on true to your
[36:08] vows
[36:10] true to your vows and with a subject of
[36:12] you or she
[36:14] you or she
[36:17] now I trust we can get this thought
[36:20] across and
[36:23] you know as I begin to think on this it
[36:25] was I began to take self-inventory
[36:27] you begin to think God am I staying true
[36:30] to my vow am I staying loyal to who I am
[36:33] and
[36:34] I'm doing all that you're calling me to
[36:36] do and I begin to look at vows in the
[36:38] Bible and
[36:40] if you have your Bible turned to numbers
[36:41] 30
[36:43] but you see this Bible is the greatest
[36:45] love story and it's the greatest vow
[36:47] ever given to man and I can tell you one
[36:49] thing that God is true to his vow that
[36:52] down through time and down through all
[36:54] generation and down through every Church
[36:56] age God has been true and he's kept his
[36:58] word
[37:01] and God makes his vows
[37:03] and he takes his vows very seriously
[37:07] he writes a whole chapter here in
[37:09] numbers 30 and we're just gonna for the
[37:11] sake of time I'm going to read a portion
[37:13] but then I'm going to try to paraphrase
[37:14] it and Moses spake unto the heads of the
[37:17] tribes concerning the children of Israel
[37:19] saying this is the thing which the Lord
[37:22] hath commanded
[37:24] if a man vows a vow unto God and swears
[37:27] an oath
[37:28] to bind his soul with the bond
[37:31] he shall not break his word and he shall
[37:34] do according to all that proceedeth out
[37:37] of his mouth
[37:38] and if a woman also vow a vow unto the
[37:42] Lord and bind herself by a bond being in
[37:46] her father's house and her Youth and her
[37:49] father hear her vow and her bond
[37:51] wherewith she hath bound her soul and
[37:55] her father shall hold his peace at her
[37:58] then all her vows shall stand
[38:01] and every Bond where which she had bound
[38:04] her soul shall stand now listen but if
[38:07] her father disallowed
[38:09] her in the day that he heareth not any
[38:13] of her vows or his barns with wherewiths
[38:17] she hath
[38:18] bound her soul shall stand but the Lord
[38:21] shall forgive her because her father
[38:24] disallowed it
[38:26] so you see that and then he goes on to
[38:28] talk about a married woman and it's the
[38:30] same thing for a married woman that if a
[38:32] married woman were to vow a vow unto God
[38:34] and she would make a vow and her husband
[38:36] hear the vow and he holds his peace and
[38:39] that vow goes through then she is
[38:40] responsible for feeling that vow but yet
[38:43] if her husband hears that vowon
[38:46] disallows it
[38:48] then God
[38:49] voids that vow
[38:51] and I begin to think spiritually
[38:54] that we have a Heavenly Father
[38:56] that whenever we go into prayer and we
[38:58] begin to cry out to him maybe in a
[39:00] season or wherever we're at we begin to
[39:02] vow and make vows and Promises yet we
[39:05] have a heavenly father and we have a
[39:07] father and a husband
[39:09] that is able to stand there and be a
[39:12] rightful judge of the vows that we make
[39:17] because he knows the intents and the
[39:20] thoughts of the heart
[39:22] and he isn't he's touched by the feeling
[39:24] of our infirmities
[39:27] he knows when to allow it and he knows
[39:30] when to avoid him
[39:32] in Deuteronomy 23 and 21 when thou vows
[39:36] when thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord
[39:38] thy God
[39:40] thou shall not slack to pay it
[39:42] for the Lord thy God will surely
[39:45] required of Thee and it shall be a sin
[39:48] in thee
[39:50] but if thou forbear it meaning if you
[39:53] refrain from saying in a vow it should
[39:55] not be no sin in thee
[39:57] that which has gone out of thy lips Thou
[39:59] shalt keep and perform even a free
[40:01] willing offering according as as thou
[40:05] has vowed unto the Lord thy God which
[40:08] thou has promised with
[40:10] thy mouth
[40:11] you see God isn't pleased in just lip
[40:14] service
[40:15] he just doesn't want you just to say
[40:16] things just to say things
[40:18] when you say something he wants you to
[40:20] be a man of your word a woman of your
[40:22] word
[40:23] that vow has to mean something
[40:29] in Psalm 61 I'm trying to build a
[40:31] thought here
[40:32] he says Hear My Cry O Lord attend unto
[40:36] my prayer
[40:39] from the end of the Earth While I Cry
[40:40] unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed
[40:42] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[40:45] I
[40:46] for Thou shalt be thou has been a
[40:49] shelter for me and a strong tower for
[40:52] mine enemies I will abide in thy
[40:54] Tabernacle forever I will trust in the
[40:56] covert of thy Wing say law for thou o
[41:00] God has heard my vows thou has given me
[41:03] the heritage of those that fear thy name
[41:06] in verse 8 and so I will sing praise
[41:09] unto thy name forever that I may daily
[41:13] perform my vows
[41:16] you see we want to daily perform our
[41:19] vows we just don't want to perform vows
[41:22] when it's convenient we don't want to
[41:24] perform vows when you feel like it when
[41:26] times are good
[41:28] you see when you make a vow sometimes
[41:30] you're in a good season in your life but
[41:32] there's going to be hard times that come
[41:33] and your vow is just as good in those
[41:36] hard times as it is in the good times
[41:39] it's easy to praise God when you're on
[41:41] the Mountaintop
[41:42] it's easy to say all is well
[41:46] for whenever you're going through a hard
[41:48] time
[41:49] we have to keep our vows
[41:52] keep our promises and may we daily
[41:55] perform our vows
[42:00] I came across this
[42:02] this story and
[42:03] it's just
[42:05] I love how God does this when you begin
[42:06] to study and it's not necessarily
[42:08] looking up certain things and it's just
[42:10] you reading your Bible and maybe it's
[42:12] for somebody tonight but I came across
[42:15] this story in Hannah and first Samuel if
[42:18] you have your Bible scroll over to
[42:22] first Samuel
[42:25] first Samuel 1.
[42:36] and we're going to start at verse 9 but
[42:37] the back story of Hannah is she's
[42:40] obvious she's the the mother of Samuel
[42:43] here
[42:44] and she's the second wife to
[42:50] El Khan
[42:52] if I said that right and he has two
[42:54] wives
[42:55] now one wife
[42:57] he has has
[42:59] all the children their family
[43:01] and here Hannah sits barren
[43:06] now God in verse 5 he says and God
[43:09] closed up her womb
[43:12] he closed up her womb
[43:15] now let's pick it up in verse 9 and he
[43:18] says so Hannah Rose after they had eaten
[43:20] in Shiloh and after they had drunk and
[43:23] now the Eli the priest sat down
[43:26] sat upon the seat by a post in the
[43:29] temple of the Lord
[43:30] and she was in bitterness of soul and
[43:33] prayed unto the Lord and wept sword
[43:38] and she vowed a vow unto God
[43:40] you ever been going through a hard time
[43:45] year after year she would go to the
[43:47] Tabernacle and she would cry onto God
[43:50] cry unto God for a child
[43:52] ask God
[43:54] let me be of man-child
[43:57] and yet God closed up her room in verse
[43:59] 5.
[44:00] but he did it for a purpose
[44:03] because whenever you get serious with
[44:05] God
[44:06] when you vow to God here and she vowed a
[44:09] vow and said oh lord of hosts
[44:12] if that will indeed look upon my
[44:14] afflictions of thy handmaid and remember
[44:16] me and not forget thy handmaiden will
[44:21] but wilt thou give unto thy handmade a
[44:24] man child then I will give him unto the
[44:26] Lord all the days of his life and there
[44:28] shall no razor come upon his head you
[44:31] see there was a time and a season that
[44:34] that was this was to come into fruition
[44:36] but it took handed to get serious with
[44:39] God it took Hannah to get into a place
[44:42] into a condition that God can bring this
[44:45] this purpose this miracle of a man-child
[44:48] to pass
[44:54] you know maybe sometimes it's time to
[44:56] get serious with God and make a vow with
[44:58] him
[44:59] to say enough is enough
[45:02] I'm going to take God at his word
[45:04] and say God if you give me this man
[45:06] child if you deliver me from this if you
[45:08] bring me through this trial
[45:10] right
[45:11] Miami and I know that he'll perform it
[45:15] now I begin to look naturally because
[45:17] what God does naturally he reflects
[45:19] spiritually and you know the biggest vow
[45:22] that we can make as human beings is a
[45:24] husband and a wife and
[45:26] you know first there must come a choice
[45:28] and when you choose
[45:31] and in whom you choose it will reflect
[45:33] on the character that's inside you
[45:37] and we know that a virtuous woman is the
[45:39] best thing for a man next to Salvation
[45:41] and
[45:42] and how important it is that we choose
[45:45] wisely because the choice
[45:47] and The Vow is what marries Us in the
[45:49] eyes of God
[45:52] The Vow is what marries Us in the eyes
[45:54] of God and I believe a hundred percent
[45:55] that you must have a relationship with
[45:58] Jesus Christ before you make any vow man
[46:01] to one man to woman or whatever you're
[46:03] trying to get married and move on and be
[46:06] you know get into a relationship you
[46:09] must first have a relationship with
[46:11] Jesus Christ
[46:12] because your relationship with Jesus
[46:14] Christ right now is going to be a
[46:16] reflection of how your personal
[46:18] relationship is with your wife because
[46:20] if you have a relationship with her and
[46:21] you have communion you have Fellowship
[46:24] you go on dates and you hang out and you
[46:26] do all these things and you spend time
[46:28] together that's the same reflection of
[46:30] your spiritual Walk With Jesus Christ
[46:32] because if you expect that you don't
[46:34] have a relationship and you're not
[46:36] praying and you're not reading and
[46:38] you're not talking and having communion
[46:41] you see God all he desired is to have
[46:44] fellowship with somebody
[46:46] this whole love story is based around
[46:49] fellowship and having a bride and having
[46:51] a family and that's all he wants
[46:55] it's a desire of each one of us to have
[46:57] a help mate to have a wife to have a
[46:59] best friend
[47:00] but yet your personal walk right now
[47:03] with Jesus is going to be a reflection
[47:05] of how your relationship is with your
[47:07] wife
[47:12] so if you're not true to Christ right
[47:15] now on your vows how can you be true to
[47:17] your wife
[47:20] most
[47:23] you see a vowel is a two-way street
[47:26] it requires Fellowship it requires love
[47:31] you see marriage doesn't fix natural
[47:33] desires
[47:39] naturally a husband and wife
[47:42] when she becomes a part of you and you
[47:43] become one and you make that vow
[47:47] everything you have
[47:49] she has everything you are she is
[47:54] she should have full access to
[47:56] everything that you have
[47:59] because you see the thing is is me you
[48:00] know and then obviously there's
[48:01] different ways to
[48:04] my wife has full access
[48:06] I give her a credit card she has full
[48:08] access why because I have confidence in
[48:10] the character of her I don't have to sit
[48:13] there and restrict her yeah we might sit
[48:14] down and say hey let's be you know let's
[48:16] not splend this or let's not do this or
[48:18] she comes up to me and asks can we buy
[48:20] this or do this because it's my
[48:22] confidence in her
[48:24] right but I give her full access
[48:27] because everything I am she is
[48:30] and you see there's different types of
[48:33] relationships naturally
[48:36] some might go on dates
[48:38] go on destination dates and travel and
[48:41] do different things some might go
[48:43] on food dates
[48:47] my wife loves to go and try out
[48:49] different Cuisines and all these
[48:51] different things
[48:53] some might buy flowers
[48:55] and I thank the Lord that my wife thinks
[48:58] that's a waste of money so I say praise
[49:00] the Lord
[49:01] and I agree
[49:05] no a little secret we do is she
[49:08] she uh instead of buying flowers
[49:10] spending forty dollars and they die the
[49:12] next you know week or whatever
[49:14] we buy a plant
[49:16] she said buy me a plant and then I can
[49:18] remember when we did a trip or whatever
[49:21] it was our anniversary
[49:25] but you see we all have different
[49:27] makeups
[49:30] we have all different relationships with
[49:33] our wives
[49:34] they're all personal one with another
[49:37] you can't be something you're not and
[49:39] you can't pretend or you can only
[49:41] pretend for so long
[49:45] now I began to look at
[49:46] The Love Languages there's five love
[49:48] languages
[49:52] and in those Love Languages you have
[49:54] physical touch and words of affirmation
[49:56] and give gift-giving and quality time
[49:59] and acts of service and I begin to think
[50:02] spiritually
[50:04] that God uses some of those Avenues to
[50:07] talk with us
[50:10] when you need the Embrace of his
[50:12] presence he comes down in your room and
[50:14] in your prayer closet and he gives you
[50:16] some physical touch and wraps his arms
[50:18] around you
[50:19] we need words of affirmation he might
[50:21] give a minister or somebody a friend to
[50:24] give you words of encouragement
[50:26] you see and then even in in our natural
[50:30] but in your spiritual what is your
[50:32] spiritual love language
[50:34] how does God use you as his bride of
[50:36] Christ
[50:45] and I began to look
[50:48] at the different types
[50:50] I begin to think of what what's God's
[50:52] type of woman now we all have a type of
[50:54] woman
[50:55] right the one you marry is your type of
[50:57] woman
[50:59] or if you're single the one you're
[51:00] looking after is the one your type of
[51:02] woman
[51:03] but God has a type of woman
[51:06] and I began to think what is God's type
[51:08] of woman because as I look across you
[51:10] see the diversity of people
[51:14] you see the diversity the differences
[51:16] and in Revelation 7 and verse 9 and I
[51:20] after I beheld and lo a great multitude
[51:22] which no man could number and
[51:25] of all Nations Kindred and people and
[51:28] tongues stood Before the Throne and
[51:30] before the lamb clothed with right robes
[51:32] and Palms in their hands you see God is
[51:34] calling a bride out of every Kindred
[51:36] tongue Nation people
[51:38] he's calling people from every part of
[51:40] the Earth
[51:42] from different backgrounds God is
[51:44] calling elect lady from every part of
[51:47] this Earth and different backgrounds
[51:49] different walks of life
[51:51] different churches different size
[51:53] churches different pastors
[51:57] and something came to me and it's a
[51:59] mini-membered body
[52:02] and so I looked up many membered body
[52:05] in the scripture we can find it in First
[52:07] Corinthians and God just began to deal
[52:09] with me last night and he says now
[52:11] concerning spiritual gifts brother and I
[52:13] would have you not ignorant
[52:15] he know that ye are Gentiles carried
[52:17] away unto these dumb Idols even as you
[52:21] were LED
[52:22] wherefore I give you understanding
[52:24] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[52:27] God calls Jesus accursed and then no man
[52:31] can say that Jesus is the Lord but by
[52:34] the Holy Ghost
[52:36] now listen
[52:38] now there are diversities of gifts but
[52:41] the Same Spirit
[52:44] there are differences of administration
[52:47] but the same Lord
[52:49] there are diverse
[52:51] diversities of operations
[52:54] but in the same God which worketh all in
[52:57] all
[52:58] right but the manifestation of the
[53:00] spirit is given to every man to profit
[53:02] with all and for to one is given the
[53:05] spirit of words of wisdom into another
[53:06] words of knowledge by The Same Spirit to
[53:10] another Faith by The Same Spirit and
[53:12] another Gifts of healing by The Same
[53:14] Spirit
[53:15] to another works of Miracles to another
[53:18] prophecy to another Discerning of
[53:20] spirits to another
[53:21] diverse kinds of tongues and to another
[53:24] interpretation of tongues
[53:27] but all these things worketh that the
[53:30] one in the self-same spirit dividing to
[53:32] every man severally as he will
[53:36] for as the body is one and hath many
[53:39] members and all the members of that body
[53:43] being many are one body so also is
[53:47] Christ
[53:48] for by one Spirit we are all baptized
[53:50] into one body whether we be jew or
[53:53] Gentile whether we be Bond or free
[53:56] and have been all made to drink from one
[53:59] spirit
[54:01] you see and gone began to deal with me
[54:02] that obviously it said many times that
[54:05] every church is sovereign
[54:08] there's different ways to operate a
[54:10] church there's different ways
[54:13] there's different ways of administration
[54:16] but you see we all have one goal one
[54:18] objective and that's to make this
[54:20] Rapture that's to get a bride ready
[54:23] because Christ is coming for here
[54:25] shortly
[54:28] brother Branham says in 65 things that
[54:30] are to be he said in my father's house
[54:31] or many mansions and I don't believe
[54:34] that when we get to heaven that will be
[54:36] when we get to heaven that will be just
[54:39] everyone looks exactly alike I don't
[54:41] believe that that all blondes and or
[54:43] brunettes or little or big or Giants I
[54:46] believe that God is a god of variety
[54:49] the world proves that he's got big
[54:51] mountains and little mountains he's got
[54:53] planes he's got deserts
[54:55] he's got different things because he's
[54:57] made it the way he wants
[55:00] the way he wanted
[55:02] and he made the season summer winter
[55:04] spring and Autumn
[55:07] he made the seasons and it shows he's a
[55:09] god of variety he made you in a variety
[55:12] some men real blusterous and some real
[55:15] dogmatic and others are fine in others
[55:17] kind and you just find all different
[55:20] kinds of people
[55:22] in his kingdom you see God is a god of
[55:25] variety
[55:27] even in weddings you see the difference
[55:29] of giving vows some
[55:32] sing a song and some write their own
[55:34] vows and some are normal and just
[55:37] say the normal vows
[55:42] but you see that vow is between you
[55:46] and the person you're making that vow to
[55:49] it's sovereign
[55:51] I have a vow between me and my wife
[55:54] and that's all I worry about my loyalty
[55:56] my consecration everything that I am is
[55:59] being loyal to that one vow that I've
[56:01] given my wife
[56:03] I shouldn't have to worry about this
[56:05] this vowel and that vowel and I don't
[56:07] try to make my brother's wife see and
[56:09] agree with the vows that I made my wife
[56:13] you see we're all Sovereign we're all
[56:16] make our own vows with Christ
[56:20] now the Bible says in First Peter 3 and
[56:23] 1 wise be in subjection to your own
[56:25] husbands
[56:27] and if you begin to read farther on it
[56:29] says in First Peter 3 and 8 and it says
[56:31] finally be all in one mind having
[56:33] compassion one to another love his
[56:35] brother and being pitiful be courteous
[56:37] not rendering evil for evil or railing
[56:40] for railing but contrary wise blessing
[56:43] knowing that you either they're unto
[56:46] cold
[56:48] and that you should inherit a blessing
[56:50] you see we're all called
[56:54] we're all calm
[56:58] you see we all have a purpose and one
[57:00] goal
[57:02] and that's to make this Rapture and
[57:04] we're striving for the same thing
[57:07] you see if we stay true to our own vows
[57:13] now if I can use an example in the Old
[57:15] Testament
[57:17] in the Old Testament when you would make
[57:19] a covenant
[57:21] with another person you would take a
[57:23] piece of paper
[57:25] Brother David I'm going to make a
[57:26] covenant with you
[57:28] and you would take a piece of paper when
[57:30] you make that you would write your
[57:32] agreement down whatever it may be
[57:35] and you would write this let's go ahead
[57:37] and stand and you would write an
[57:39] agreement
[57:41] and we'd both agree on it and so I'm
[57:43] going to write a vow and My Vow would be
[57:46] I promise to worship when David's lean
[57:48] songs and he promises to say Amen when I
[57:50] preach okay amen
[57:52] all right that's our vow
[57:55] but see you have a vowel
[57:57] and it's written out
[57:59] and we would tear this vowel
[58:03] in half
[58:04] and he would take one and I would take
[58:07] one
[58:08] and what we do is we'd kill a sacrifice
[58:12] and we'd kill the sacrifice and we'd
[58:14] split it in two
[58:16] and we'd put one behind me and one
[58:18] behind him
[58:21] and if none of if one of us didn't
[58:23] fulfill
[58:24] this vow that we made
[58:26] we would be as dead as that sacrifice
[58:30] how important it is for us to keep our
[58:33] vow to God
[58:38] I'm gonna make another vow
[58:40] Jonathan come up stand on this side
[58:45] it's the same thing we would make a vow
[58:51] and he would take that vow
[58:53] now I got two vows
[58:57] understand where I'm going with this
[59:00] I cannot put these two together these
[59:02] two do not match
[59:04] so why do we get caught up in one
[59:06] another's vows
[59:07] worrying about is he keeping his
[59:09] promises he keeping his this vow is
[59:11] between me and him and this vow is
[59:13] between me and him
[59:15] you can't cross vows because they won't
[59:18] match up they won't dovetail one with
[59:20] another
[59:21] thank you Brothers
[59:24] you see God made a vow with each one of
[59:27] us
[59:29] he gave us a vow to live by that our
[59:33] life might dovetail one with another
[59:36] and each one of us have a vow to keep
[59:38] with him a covenant one with him
[59:41] and our life must dovetail one with
[59:44] another with this vow and we must stay
[59:46] true to this vow
[59:48] so we shouldn't get caught up and if I'm
[59:50] keeping my vow over here and he's
[59:51] keeping his vow
[59:57] God made a covenant with each one of us
[1:00:02] and over on Calvary
[1:00:06] he took a sacrifice
[1:00:11] and he killed his only begotten son
[1:00:18] and just like the first Adam
[1:00:21] when God put him to sleep into the Earth
[1:00:24] and from his rib
[1:00:25] he pulled out a help me a bride
[1:00:30] for Adam
[1:00:31] so did Christ
[1:00:34] Calvary
[1:00:39] at Calvary he Sled Shed his only
[1:00:41] begotten son
[1:00:44] and as the soldier pierced his side
[1:00:46] blood
[1:00:47] and water came out from him and his
[1:00:49] Spirit left
[1:00:51] and brother Branham says the he split
[1:00:54] his son in two as a sacrifice
[1:00:57] and he sent his body up to the right
[1:00:59] hand of God and he sent his Spirit down
[1:01:01] to the church
[1:01:03] for you and I and now he's pouring
[1:01:05] himself out
[1:01:15] in questions and answers in 64 he says
[1:01:17] when Jesus suffered in that body he
[1:01:19] suffered
[1:01:21] cause a man and a woman because a woman
[1:01:24] and a man are one person Eve was taken
[1:01:27] out of Adam in the church what happened
[1:01:30] God opened up his side at him and took
[1:01:32] out of there helped made a bride and God
[1:01:34] opened up at his side at Calvary and
[1:01:36] took out a bride and when Jesus died at
[1:01:39] Calvary remember the bride was taken
[1:01:41] from his body until he was dead
[1:01:44] she was not taken from his body until he
[1:01:47] was dead
[1:01:48] why
[1:01:49] because he must die first and Redemption
[1:01:52] must happen
[1:01:53] listen he had already died
[1:01:57] and then they was going to break his leg
[1:01:59] and a prophet said they'll be not to be
[1:02:03] one bone broken
[1:02:05] and so they drove
[1:02:07] they've done drawn back the hammer to
[1:02:09] break a leg and a man went up with a
[1:02:12] spear and pushed it in him through his
[1:02:14] heart and water and blood came forth he
[1:02:17] was already dead she was already
[1:02:19] redeemed in the body by his death so
[1:02:21] there's no more suffering no more
[1:02:24] suffering tribulation period for the
[1:02:26] bride
[1:02:27] do you see God had already died there he
[1:02:31] hung on a cross and he spread out his
[1:02:33] arms and he said it is finished and he
[1:02:36] bowed his head and died and their
[1:02:38] Redemption happened
[1:02:41] so the bride is already redeemed before
[1:02:43] it happened
[1:02:45] so the the spear that pierced his side
[1:02:48] did not kill our lord Jesus
[1:02:51] what happened is Spirit
[1:02:53] came out upon the Earth
[1:02:55] came down for his bride
[1:03:00] you see if you were in them at Calvary
[1:03:02] your redemption's already been paid
[1:03:04] your vow has already been made
[1:03:08] in the marriage of the Lamb he says now
[1:03:10] look it's so perfect that when God took
[1:03:12] and made a man and to show that he did
[1:03:14] not want it out of anything different
[1:03:17] the man was not in the original Cree the
[1:03:19] woman was not in the original creation
[1:03:22] so she is not in the creation but she is
[1:03:24] a part of Adam
[1:03:26] she's a byproduct
[1:03:28] but he goes into the side of Adam now to
[1:03:31] make another creature
[1:03:34] but to take a part of a of the creature
[1:03:37] and make another creature out of it and
[1:03:39] he took the masculine spirit that was in
[1:03:42] Adam and he took the feminine spirit
[1:03:44] that was in Adam rather
[1:03:46] and put it over into the woman so both
[1:03:48] spirit and body they become one
[1:03:51] he says what a beautiful type it was
[1:03:53] that God did at Calvary he took Christ
[1:03:56] and connected him with the church
[1:03:57] through rivie inside he brought the
[1:04:00] blood that cleansed the person that
[1:04:02] sanctifies the Flesh of the church and
[1:04:05] puts the spirit of the Living God that
[1:04:07] he took off the cross there out of
[1:04:10] Christ and he put it into where
[1:04:12] the individual
[1:04:13] there you are there you become one
[1:04:16] Christ and you are one you see he poured
[1:04:21] himself out into his into his church
[1:04:23] everything Christ was he poured out into
[1:04:25] his church
[1:04:27] but yet you got to make it personal with
[1:04:29] you that everything God was everything
[1:04:31] God is your husband everything he is he
[1:04:35] pours into you and you become one he's
[1:04:38] one with the individual
[1:04:43] you see in choosing of a bride he says
[1:04:45] the True Church of Christ the bride is
[1:04:47] so sold out to him
[1:04:49] and his promised word till every mind
[1:04:52] that is in Christ is in you
[1:04:55] what a difference
[1:04:58] and then he says the modern Church
[1:05:02] and then there's a spiritual church and
[1:05:04] both are being pregnanted
[1:05:06] what is it
[1:05:08] even as this Asbury Revival is happening
[1:05:11] causing a Revival all over what are they
[1:05:13] doing
[1:05:14] they're being pregnant but yet there's a
[1:05:17] spiritual church that's being pregnated
[1:05:18] with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:23] and I began to look that as it was at
[1:05:26] Calvary for the Branham says that there
[1:05:29] was a representation of both at Calvary
[1:05:31] both sides he says you see
[1:05:34] he said it in the mark of the beast he
[1:05:36] says that there was a representation of
[1:05:39] both sides he says we see three crosses
[1:05:42] but really there was four
[1:05:46] he said what God was doing the only
[1:05:48] begotten son came down and God slain the
[1:05:51] only begotten son and he took he came
[1:05:53] from heaven and he was going back to
[1:05:54] heaven with the repented Center
[1:05:58] and Judas was the fourth tree and he
[1:06:01] hung himself on a sycamore tree
[1:06:05] and he came from Hell the Son of
[1:06:07] Perdition and he came from hell and he
[1:06:08] went back to hell and he took with him
[1:06:10] The unrepented Sinner
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:15] so what vow are you making what side are
[1:06:18] you fulfilling
[1:06:19] we got to choose one or the other you
[1:06:22] can't serve two masters
[1:06:25] you can't serve God in Mammon right
[1:06:28] we got to serve somebody
[1:06:30] I want to say I want to serve the Lord
[1:06:32] Jesus I want to be on his side I want to
[1:06:35] surrender my all to him
[1:06:42] so we see that there's two sides
[1:06:45] and here in the last days
[1:06:49] brother Branham says on the continuation
[1:06:51] that quote of choosing of a bride in the
[1:06:54] next paragraph he says the world
[1:06:55] counselor in churches will produce the
[1:06:57] world
[1:06:58] and the Antichrist through denomination
[1:07:01] shall be given birth to her son the
[1:07:03] Antichrist
[1:07:05] the other is being pregnanted by the
[1:07:07] word of God and will bring forth the
[1:07:09] body and finished body of Jesus Christ
[1:07:11] which is the bride
[1:07:20] the body of Christ which isn't finished
[1:07:22] yet
[1:07:24] how many knows that
[1:07:26] a man and a woman is one and Christ in
[1:07:28] his body the word the bride will have to
[1:07:31] be the rest of that body and the two
[1:07:33] together make the body one again
[1:07:36] like Adam was at the beginning man his
[1:07:39] wife are one now she the bride so sold
[1:07:42] out to him that she uses no mind of her
[1:07:46] own she sold out to her formal things
[1:07:51] you see the Finish
[1:07:53] the finished Body of Christ
[1:07:57] the body of Christ isn't finished
[1:08:00] God is incomplete without you
[1:08:04] as great as God is
[1:08:07] and all down through time he's fulfilled
[1:08:09] himself but yet he's not complete
[1:08:11] without his bride
[1:08:15] you have to be so sold out to him dead
[1:08:17] to your former things
[1:08:21] now listen
[1:08:23] God will never join himself
[1:08:26] to you if you're not dead to your first
[1:08:29] husband
[1:08:32] God can't do it it's against his law
[1:08:36] he'd be get committing adultery
[1:08:40] you see a woman is so sacred in what she
[1:08:42] has
[1:08:44] a woman is so sacred that she must keep
[1:08:47] that for only her husband
[1:08:50] and if a woman goes out and loses that
[1:08:53] sacredness
[1:08:55] she can only be forgiven
[1:08:58] but she can't be justified
[1:09:02] because if you go out and you lose that
[1:09:07] you can only be forgiven by your husband
[1:09:10] but you can't be justified because you
[1:09:12] she can never have
[1:09:15] that virginity back
[1:09:18] are you with me
[1:09:21] and so now is naturally
[1:09:25] if a woman is untrue
[1:09:30] she can only be forgiven and now we're
[1:09:33] living in a generation where it's a
[1:09:35] woman's age
[1:09:39] that the beauty of women are at all-time
[1:09:41] high
[1:09:46] that women are thrown in your face at
[1:09:48] every turn
[1:09:51] it could be a microphone commercial and
[1:09:54] they got to have some naked woman on
[1:09:56] there
[1:09:57] it could be a car commercial and there's
[1:10:00] got to be some kind of woman on it why
[1:10:02] because it's the spirit of the age
[1:10:05] and you see now we're living in a time
[1:10:08] where there's no vows there's no
[1:10:09] marriage vows there's no accountability
[1:10:12] why because then they have to stay true
[1:10:13] to one person they don't have the
[1:10:15] freedom they don't have the Liberty
[1:10:18] to live their lives to enjoy life
[1:10:21] because they're bound to a vow
[1:10:24] they're living under a conditional vow
[1:10:26] well as long as I get to do this then
[1:10:28] I'll agree to this
[1:10:33] you see and when times get tough they
[1:10:35] just want to hit the door
[1:10:37] I know buddies that I grew up in high
[1:10:39] school with and they've been living with
[1:10:40] their significant other for seven years
[1:10:43] and they've never agreed to have their
[1:10:45] vows
[1:10:46] because then it makes it a whole lot
[1:10:48] complicated if they want to leave
[1:10:53] you take a man who has some good money a
[1:10:56] good paying job and all of a sudden you
[1:10:57] know what I'm up and out wife leaves
[1:10:59] them she takes half of everything
[1:11:02] so it's better we just not agree to make
[1:11:04] a vow of one with another
[1:11:06] see how insane our society and how
[1:11:08] corrupt the minds of our people have
[1:11:10] become
[1:11:14] and you see
[1:11:17] that's how some people's relationship
[1:11:19] was with with Christ
[1:11:22] they want it to be on condition
[1:11:25] they want a vow
[1:11:27] that fits their lifestyle
[1:11:30] they don't want to live by a vow that
[1:11:32] God gave them
[1:11:34] that he paid a price he
[1:11:36] killed his only begotten son
[1:11:38] paid the ultimate sacrifice
[1:11:41] but yet they don't want their life to
[1:11:43] dovetail with the scripture they don't
[1:11:45] want to match it up they want to pick
[1:11:46] and choose what they want to live
[1:11:51] now we know this in in second
[1:11:53] Corinthians 6 and 14
[1:11:58] be not unequally yoked together with
[1:12:00] unbelievers
[1:12:02] now in the message you hear this all the
[1:12:04] time
[1:12:05] for young people and we shouldn't be
[1:12:07] married one with another choosing
[1:12:10] somebody outside our ranks but I want
[1:12:12] you to think spiritually now
[1:12:14] because God can't join himself if you're
[1:12:16] not dead to your old husband that old
[1:12:19] husband be in your flesh
[1:12:23] be not unequally yoked with unbelievers
[1:12:26] for what Fellowship hath righteousness
[1:12:28] with unrighteousness
[1:12:30] what communion hath light with Darkness
[1:12:33] you see if we got darkness in our life
[1:12:35] how can God come and have communion with
[1:12:37] you
[1:12:39] well Concord hath Christ with the belief
[1:12:42] on what part hath the believer with an
[1:12:43] Infidel and what agreement hath the
[1:12:46] temple of God with Idols for ye are the
[1:12:49] Temple of the Living God and hath said I
[1:12:51] will dwell in them and walk in them and
[1:12:53] I will be their God and they shall be my
[1:12:55] people wherefore come out of them out
[1:12:58] from amongst them and be separate saith
[1:13:01] the Lord and touch not thy the unclean
[1:13:03] and I will receive you
[1:13:06] you see if you do these things God will
[1:13:08] come unto you
[1:13:10] he'll make a vow with you
[1:13:15] and back to Calvary I
[1:13:18] that's why God had to make a provided
[1:13:20] way
[1:13:21] and it had to be through Calvary the
[1:13:24] shedding of his own son he had to pay a
[1:13:26] sacrifice for Redemption
[1:13:30] and you must come Christ provided way
[1:13:36] meaning that you can't
[1:13:38] put new wine in an old bottle
[1:13:41] you can't get the Holy Ghost before
[1:13:43] you're cleansed
[1:13:44] but there's a process and I want you to
[1:13:46] understand where I'm going and God help
[1:13:48] me
[1:13:51] and as I begin to think that
[1:13:52] justification is the foundation
[1:13:56] and stay with me justification is
[1:13:57] foundation because God wants you to
[1:14:00] realize something
[1:14:02] that justification is for you
[1:14:07] for the for Matthew says in in verse 12
[1:14:10] 36 he says for by Thy word shall thou be
[1:14:13] justified
[1:14:16] that's not forgiven but by Thy word
[1:14:17] shall that be condemned Romans 5 and 1
[1:14:21] says therefore being justified by faith
[1:14:23] you are justified by faith
[1:14:28] we have a peace with God through the
[1:14:29] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:31] you see you're just not a forgiven bride
[1:14:35] but you are Justified
[1:14:37] Justified as never did it in the first
[1:14:40] place
[1:14:43] you see you have to be justified
[1:14:46] God already paid the price
[1:14:49] and justification when you realize what
[1:14:51] justification is is for you
[1:14:55] because how many begin to think I'm not
[1:14:58] worthy
[1:14:59] I don't know why he loves me but he does
[1:15:02] I don't know why he chose me but he did
[1:15:06] through all my faults through all my
[1:15:08] failures God had to make a provided way
[1:15:11] that he couldn't have a forgiven bride
[1:15:13] but he had to have a Justified bride so
[1:15:16] he had to pay a price at Calvary
[1:15:18] and he had to shed his own son to have a
[1:15:22] token
[1:15:23] that would cover our sins through the
[1:15:26] shedding of his blood
[1:15:32] you see God loves you for what you are
[1:15:38] God loves you for who you are
[1:15:41] you know you only you can fulfill your
[1:15:44] purpose in life
[1:15:48] before the foundation of the world God
[1:15:50] predestinated for you to be you
[1:15:54] to you for you to fulfill your purpose
[1:15:57] and your placing in the body of Christ
[1:16:00] nobody can take that place I can't take
[1:16:03] that place
[1:16:04] I can't take brother Jonathan's place
[1:16:06] and he can't take my place because each
[1:16:08] one of us have a purpose
[1:16:11] each one of us have a placing
[1:16:14] and God predestinated you for a time in
[1:16:17] an hour
[1:16:18] that he has confidence in who you are
[1:16:20] that you will fulfill
[1:16:22] what's inside of you
[1:16:29] you see it's not how you see yourself
[1:16:32] but it's how God sees you
[1:16:41] listen the Apostle Paul says
[1:16:45] in second Corinthians 11 and 2 he says
[1:16:47] for I am jealous over you with a Godly
[1:16:49] jealousy
[1:16:51] for I have espoused you unto one husband
[1:16:54] that I may present to you as a chaste
[1:16:58] virgin
[1:17:00] to Christ
[1:17:03] how can you be a virgin sometimes many
[1:17:06] times in our own carnal thinking you see
[1:17:08] that's where justification comes in
[1:17:10] because as a Chase virgin to Christ
[1:17:12] God's only going to marry that virgin
[1:17:15] but yet you must come that provided way
[1:17:18] that God has
[1:17:24] you see you have to be dead to your own
[1:17:25] ways dead to our own thinking
[1:17:29] staying true to her vows
[1:17:32] making sure that our lives dovetail with
[1:17:34] the word of God
[1:17:38] in the marriage of the Lamb 62 he says
[1:17:40] when and then when the church has the
[1:17:42] ceremony
[1:17:43] makes their promise and then she takes a
[1:17:45] bride the bridegroom's name she is no
[1:17:48] longer a church of the world she is a
[1:17:50] church in the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:17:53] now I don't mean by name I mean by birth
[1:17:55] by Nature by the power of God by the
[1:17:59] revealed truth of God in in the heart
[1:18:02] she becomes the Christian Church the
[1:18:05] great Universal Apostolic Christian
[1:18:07] Church she becomes a part of Christ and
[1:18:09] when she does that Christ inject injects
[1:18:13] into her his own Spirit his own life and
[1:18:16] the Bible says in Adam and Eve you are
[1:18:18] no longer Twain but you were one and
[1:18:20] when the woman the church is married to
[1:18:22] Christ they are no longer two they are
[1:18:24] one it's Christ in you amen that's it
[1:18:27] his life has been brought into you then
[1:18:31] you become the bride
[1:18:38] he talks about his wife being no longer
[1:18:40] boy but Branham
[1:18:43] and Skip down and he says when you come
[1:18:45] into Christ you're no more of the world
[1:18:48] you are of Christ see
[1:18:51] you care not then for the things of the
[1:18:53] world they are dead to you
[1:18:55] for he that loves the world or the
[1:18:57] things of the world the love of God is
[1:18:58] in in him
[1:19:01] so you see you can't be an artificial
[1:19:04] Christian you can't be an artificial
[1:19:06] professed Christian
[1:19:08] but you can't be a Christian become
[1:19:10] until Christ injects himself by the
[1:19:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost into you then
[1:19:16] you're connected in him you're no longer
[1:19:18] Twain you were one Christ promised to be
[1:19:21] in in us and the father was in Christ I
[1:19:25] and the father are one you and I are one
[1:19:27] see Christ in us all that God was he
[1:19:31] poured into his in Christ and all that
[1:19:33] Christ was he poured into his church
[1:19:36] what was the purpose
[1:19:38] to continue the gospel
[1:19:40] you see everything God was
[1:19:44] everything that Christ was he poured
[1:19:46] into us
[1:19:48] we must realize the power that lays
[1:19:51] within the elect lady
[1:19:53] the power that lays within the vows that
[1:19:56] you made
[1:19:57] see it's your confidence in the in The
[1:20:00] Vow that you make with your spouse that
[1:20:04] they will stay true to what they say and
[1:20:05] that you'll stay true to what you say
[1:20:10] many say that God was just an ordinary
[1:20:12] man just a normal man
[1:20:15] some might say that you're just an
[1:20:16] ordinary Christian
[1:20:18] but I believe that the elect go elect
[1:20:20] lady is more than just an ordinary lady
[1:20:24] because just as Jesus was out on a boat
[1:20:26] one day
[1:20:28] and the storms and the waves begin to
[1:20:30] crash down
[1:20:33] and some would say he's just a man but
[1:20:34] yet whenever he
[1:20:36] woke from his sleep and he stood at the
[1:20:38] bow of the boat and he said peace be
[1:20:41] still
[1:20:41] he was more than a man
[1:20:44] but what was it it was the deity of God
[1:20:48] how many have
[1:20:50] storms in their life and your boat is
[1:20:53] Raging and you're out on the water
[1:20:56] and you don't understand what's
[1:20:57] happening
[1:20:59] but yet I challenge you to stand on the
[1:21:01] bow of your boat because you might just
[1:21:03] be an ordinary Christian
[1:21:05] but yet as an elect Lady Of God there's
[1:21:07] something inside of you a deity that God
[1:21:10] sent down that I Calvary when he poured
[1:21:12] out his spirit and he gave it into the
[1:21:15] church he gave you that same deity that
[1:21:17] same power
[1:21:19] and it's time to speak to your storm
[1:21:22] that you say peace be still
[1:21:25] in the winds and the waves that obey
[1:21:27] your voice
[1:21:29] because it's God in you
[1:21:32] just like when Christ was that the tomb
[1:21:36] of Lazarus and some say he was just a
[1:21:38] man because he wept
[1:21:40] but yet when he said come forth
[1:21:43] he's more than a man
[1:21:46] you were more than just an ordinary
[1:21:49] Christian
[1:21:50] you're more than that
[1:21:52] as the elect Lady Of God you have full
[1:21:55] Authority you have full power everything
[1:21:57] that Christ was he poured into you and
[1:22:00] when you begin to realize that the power
[1:22:02] that lays before you
[1:22:06] how many have loved ones that are dead
[1:22:09] in sin
[1:22:11] it's time to speak to that
[1:22:13] it's time to say
[1:22:15] come forth
[1:22:17] it's time to live
[1:22:20] it's by the power of your own words by
[1:22:22] the power of your confession
[1:22:28] you see your vowel
[1:22:31] God has made a vow with each one of us
[1:22:35] he's given us full access
[1:22:38] to the word of God
[1:22:40] full access to the spoken word
[1:22:45] and it's your character
[1:22:49] to be a rightful judge of how you use it
[1:22:57] his word is full of vows made to us as
[1:23:00] the elect lady
[1:23:02] he says I'm the same yesterday today and
[1:23:04] forever
[1:23:05] he says I'll be with you even in you
[1:23:07] until the end of the world
[1:23:11] he said the works that I do a greater
[1:23:14] work that you will do
[1:23:16] you see when you begin to take these
[1:23:17] things personal they're more than just
[1:23:19] words on a scripture on a in a Bible
[1:23:23] they're just more than words on a piece
[1:23:25] of paper
[1:23:27] but it's whenever you begin to take that
[1:23:29] personal and you begin to live by it
[1:23:33] you begin to say greater is he that is
[1:23:35] in me than he that's in the world
[1:23:44] you see what God did
[1:23:47] in Saint John 14 he said I go to prepare
[1:23:50] a place what is he doing
[1:23:52] he made a vow with us and then he gave
[1:23:54] us an inheritance the earnest of our
[1:23:57] inheritance
[1:23:59] he gave us the earnest but yet he said I
[1:24:01] go to prepare a place why
[1:24:03] you just don't go to prepare a place for
[1:24:06] just somebody
[1:24:08] if I told Jonathan I'm going to prepare
[1:24:10] a place for you he'd be like well you
[1:24:11] giving me a free house
[1:24:15] but that when you go to prepare a place
[1:24:18] it's for somebody you've made a vow with
[1:24:21] somebody who you've pulled into yourself
[1:24:28] and he's made that vow with each one of
[1:24:30] us I go to prepare a place
[1:24:33] you know God says what he means and
[1:24:36] means what he says
[1:24:45] you know in the natural
[1:24:51] sometimes you go through hard times and
[1:24:55] in the natural
[1:24:57] a couple would renew their vow after so
[1:24:59] many years
[1:25:01] it's not that they're living Unfaithful
[1:25:03] and true
[1:25:05] but yet maybe they just need to renew it
[1:25:08] need a fresh love one for another maybe
[1:25:11] they need to go on another honeymoon
[1:25:12] maybe they need to go on another date
[1:25:13] whatever that may be
[1:25:16] maybe the woman has become insecure
[1:25:19] you see as time goes on and things
[1:25:21] change in your marriage
[1:25:24] even as a woman
[1:25:27] you begin to question does he still love
[1:25:30] me
[1:25:31] and you could sit there and say God how
[1:25:33] do you still love me after I've made
[1:25:34] mistakes after I've fallen after I
[1:25:36] failed
[1:25:39] naturally you
[1:25:41] might put on some weight after pregnancy
[1:25:43] whatever it may be and I'm not the young
[1:25:45] woman or I'm not the young man that I
[1:25:47] used to be
[1:25:48] but yet there's a vow made
[1:25:53] you see no matter what comes what goes
[1:25:56] in a marriage through the ups through
[1:25:59] the Downs what keeps you together is
[1:26:01] that vow
[1:26:03] because things will change hard times
[1:26:05] will come
[1:26:07] it's not if but when
[1:26:09] they will come
[1:26:12] but yet it's staying true and being
[1:26:14] loyal to that vow
[1:26:25] he's never once broken his vow
[1:26:29] children
[1:26:32] may we become bold when may we come
[1:26:34] boldly before his throne
[1:26:37] knowing that the vows that we say
[1:26:41] we must keep
[1:26:43] because God
[1:26:46] let me say it like this God has
[1:26:48] confidence
[1:26:49] or you have confidence in God
[1:26:52] I know that God will keep his end of the
[1:26:54] deal
[1:26:56] but I ask the question can God have
[1:26:58] confidence in your side
[1:27:01] can God have confidence in you to keep
[1:27:03] your in
[1:27:12] God's not complete without you
[1:27:15] he needs his bride
[1:27:17] to fulfill his work to finish off the
[1:27:20] work
[1:27:30] you see when
[1:27:31] I began to think on
[1:27:34] making a vow
[1:27:40] as I said before things sometimes things
[1:27:43] happen
[1:27:46] and even in
[1:27:49] our relationship
[1:27:51] even with my wife and
[1:27:52] you know Valentine's just happened and
[1:27:56] yet you get older and things change
[1:28:03] you begin to question
[1:28:05] not necessarily question but within
[1:28:08] yourself
[1:28:09] you begin to wonder
[1:28:10] through all my faults through all my
[1:28:12] failures do they still love me how can
[1:28:14] they still love me
[1:28:18] but yet God made a vow before the
[1:28:20] foundation of the world with you
[1:28:23] and he chose you and he predestinated
[1:28:26] you and he knew your faults he knew your
[1:28:28] failures
[1:28:29] he knew when you would make mistakes
[1:28:32] and he said I would still love you
[1:28:36] he thought so much of you
[1:28:39] he thought so much of you
[1:28:42] that he sent down his son to pay that
[1:28:45] sacrifice
[1:28:46] through Redemption through his blood
[1:28:49] he thought so much of you that you would
[1:28:51] fulfill your end of the deal
[1:28:52] that he chose you for this hour
[1:28:56] because there's one elect lady in this
[1:28:58] hour that is going to go fulfill his
[1:29:00] word
[1:29:02] let's stand
[1:29:10] let's bow our heads
[1:29:22] our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:29:27] Lord we bow before you in your presence
[1:29:32] realizing Lord
[1:29:34] the vows between us made
[1:29:39] Lord and I myself want to stay true to
[1:29:42] that vow I want to be loyal
[1:29:44] I want to be a man of my word I want to
[1:29:47] be faithful
[1:29:52] and Lord you have called us you have
[1:29:54] predestined us for an hour you have
[1:29:56] chosen us
[1:29:59] and Lord we're asking
[1:30:01] for your help
[1:30:09] I don't know
[1:30:17] maybe somebody hasn't made a vow
[1:30:26] maybe somebody's been on this road a
[1:30:28] long time
[1:30:31] and they need a refreshing of their vows
[1:30:38] maybe there's some that haven't been
[1:30:40] true maybe some have
[1:30:43] Lord things come up and
[1:30:46] or we want to ask for forgiveness
[1:30:49] or we want your blood to cover us and to
[1:30:51] wash us and
[1:30:56] Lord through the power and
[1:30:59] of your blood and through justification
[1:31:01] that you sent down your son and
[1:31:04] Lord help us to realize that
[1:31:08] the Bride of this last day she's not
[1:31:10] just forgiven but she's Justified Lord
[1:31:13] she never did it in the first place
[1:31:16] our sins were thrown in the sea of
[1:31:18] forgetfulness
[1:31:21] and I'm so thankful for your grace and
[1:31:23] for your mercy that you've poured out on
[1:31:25] us
[1:31:26] brother Branham says sometimes
[1:31:28] as human nature we
[1:31:32] we can forget
[1:31:34] we can forgive but we can't forget
[1:31:38] we can't forget sometimes our human
[1:31:40] natures and they get in the way and
[1:31:44] we remember
[1:31:46] maybe the way a person was or the things
[1:31:49] they did
[1:31:51] but Lord you don't even see him that way
[1:31:54] Lord you see him as Justified you see
[1:31:56] him as washed you see him as your elect
[1:31:58] lady you see him as chosen
[1:32:04] so help us Lord in our carnality
[1:32:10] Lord to be a righteous judge of those
[1:32:12] around us to not worry about what's
[1:32:14] happening and this tick for attack and
[1:32:18] but Lord let us focus on our vow with
[1:32:21] you that our life may dovetail
[1:32:23] that I might be matched up with your
[1:32:26] word
[1:32:29] Lord we're so thankful and
[1:32:32] Lord I ask this special blessing upon
[1:32:35] your people
[1:32:36] Lord may we you be with him may you go
[1:32:38] with him
[1:32:40] may you be their portion may you uplift
[1:32:42] them and
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:44] Lord we're just so thankful to be called
[1:32:46] to be chosen in this dark day
[1:32:50] we just asked a special blessing upon
[1:32:52] your people
[1:32:53] be with the needs and be with our pastor
[1:32:56] as he comes home
[1:32:58] we commit our lives and
[1:33:00] Lord may we always be in the center of
[1:33:02] your will
[1:33:04] not choosing our will but your will
[1:33:07] would you say we love you and we thank
[1:33:09] you
