[51:05] always mother and Grace

[51:09] Believer it's a mother in Grace
[51:12] she said son if you just sing that song
[51:15] and I was driving here and I thought

[1:01:07] his word is true
[1:01:09] amen Proverbs chapter 12.
[1:01:17] and verse 4.
[1:01:21] a virtuous woman is a crowned to her
[1:01:24] husband
[1:01:26] but she that maketh ashamed is
[1:01:29] rottenness in his bones
[1:01:34] a virtuous woman
[1:01:37] is a crown
[1:01:39] to her husband
[1:01:41] Proverbs 31
[1:01:48] and starting at verse 10 and
[1:01:52] will read 10 and 12 then we'll drop down
[1:01:54] to verse 25. who can find a virtuous
[1:01:58] woman
[1:02:00] for her price is far above rubies
[1:02:04] I want to ask you who is qualified
[1:02:09] to find
[1:02:11] a virtuous woman not just a woman
[1:02:14] a virtuous who can do it who's got the
[1:02:17] discernment
[1:02:18] who's got that guala a Godly
[1:02:21] qualification to find her
[1:02:28] who
[1:02:30] it'll take a prophet of God
[1:02:35] who can find a virtuous woman
[1:02:39] for her price is far above rubies
[1:02:42] the heart of her husband does safely
[1:02:45] trust in her so that he shall have no
[1:02:48] need of spoil
[1:02:50] she will do him good and not evil all
[1:02:52] the days of her life verse 25
[1:02:56] strength and honor are her clothing
[1:03:00] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[1:03:04] she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in
[1:03:07] her tongue is the law of kindness
[1:03:11] she looketh well to the ways of her
[1:03:13] household
[1:03:15] and eateth not the bread of idleness
[1:03:18] her children arise up and call her
[1:03:21] blessed her husband also
[1:03:24] and he prayseth her
[1:03:27] many daughters have done virtuously but
[1:03:30] thou excellast
[1:03:32] them all
[1:03:34] the bride is the one who excels the
[1:03:38] virtue of all others
[1:03:40] favors deceitful
[1:03:43] and beauty is vain
[1:03:46] but a woman that feareth the Lord
[1:03:49] she shall be praised give her the fruit
[1:03:52] of her hands
[1:03:54] and let her own works praise her in the
[1:03:58] gates
[1:03:59] may God add the blessing to the reading
[1:04:02] of his word you all may be seated this
[1:04:04] morning
[1:04:05] in the presence of God
[1:04:07] praise the Lord this morning
[1:04:11] good to have each and every one of you
[1:04:14] guests visitors each and every one I
[1:04:16] would like to title my sermon this
[1:04:18] morning
[1:04:19] The Virtuous bride will be the crowning
[1:04:22] Glory of Christ
[1:04:25] The Virtuous bride
[1:04:29] will be the crowning Glory of Christ
[1:04:33] and I want to take a subject this
[1:04:35] morning
[1:04:36] she will be the jewels in his crown
[1:04:45] virtuous women are found all throughout
[1:04:48] the scriptures
[1:04:50] and I want you to understand that they
[1:04:52] all had virtue
[1:04:54] before cleansing
[1:04:59] God doesn't look at the outside he looks
[1:05:01] at the inside
[1:05:04] God saw virtue before he saw conversion
[1:05:09] God wasn't looking at the outside shell
[1:05:12] of the woman at the at the will he was
[1:05:15] looking at the seed Gene that laid
[1:05:18] inside of her
[1:05:20] understand that she had hardwired into
[1:05:24] into her DNA
[1:05:30] a very virtue
[1:05:33] that can only be attributed to a sea
[1:05:37] Gene of God
[1:05:42] and Boaz had recognized the virtue of
[1:05:46] Ruth's character as she worked in his
[1:05:49] field
[1:05:53] she has shown more kindness and virtue
[1:05:56] in her latter years than she did in the
[1:05:59] beginning in Ruth chapter 3 verses 9
[1:06:02] through 11 it's written
[1:06:04] and he said who art thou
[1:06:07] and she answered I am Ruth the handmaid
[1:06:11] spread therefore thy skirt over thy
[1:06:14] handmaid
[1:06:15] for thou art nearer Kinsmen
[1:06:20] and he said blessed be thou of the Lord
[1:06:22] my daughter
[1:06:24] for thou has showed more kindness
[1:06:27] in the latter and then in the beginning
[1:06:31] inasmuch as thou has followed not young
[1:06:33] men
[1:06:36] whether poor or Rich
[1:06:40] and now my daughter fear not
[1:06:44] I will do to thee all that thou requires
[1:06:49] for all the city of my people
[1:06:53] doth know
[1:06:54] thou art a virtuous woman
[1:07:03] it says here that you showed more
[1:07:05] kindness I looked at this word kindness
[1:07:08] in Hebrew it actually means
[1:07:10] kindness towards God
[1:07:14] it means
[1:07:15] doing
[1:07:17] God good deeds
[1:07:22] you showed more kindness you showed more
[1:07:24] Good Deeds at the latter end than you
[1:07:27] did at the beginning
[1:07:29] that's why she has become a mature bride
[1:07:33] she's matured through seven Church ages
[1:07:37] and what she did in her immaturity in
[1:07:39] the early ages she will not do in the
[1:07:41] end
[1:07:43] he tells her not to fear don't be afraid
[1:07:47] for I will perform all that thou
[1:07:50] requires
[1:07:52] fear not little bride
[1:07:55] it is the Father's good pleasure to give
[1:07:58] unto you the kingdom
[1:08:01] and Boaz said these words he said not
[1:08:04] only do I recognize it but all of my
[1:08:06] people in the city
[1:08:08] he didn't say all of the people in the
[1:08:11] city he said all of my people
[1:08:14] it takes one to no one
[1:08:18] you understand that
[1:08:20] and so all of my people within the city
[1:08:24] recognize thou art a virtuous woman
[1:08:29] when boys took Ruth and redeemed her
[1:08:33] he saw in her virtue before cleansing
[1:08:38] Christ saw virtue in you before your
[1:08:42] conversion because the Bible says that
[1:08:46] God commandeth his love towards us that
[1:08:49] while we were yet sinners
[1:08:51] Christ died for us
[1:08:59] she laid herself down where Boaz laid
[1:09:03] a type of death
[1:09:05] and she
[1:09:07] laid down a type of laying down her life
[1:09:11] at the feet of Christ
[1:09:13] a type of the Bride who gives her life
[1:09:17] unto him
[1:09:20] where he dies she dies
[1:09:24] where he rises she Rises
[1:09:28] she marked the spot Naomi told her Mark
[1:09:31] the Spot
[1:09:33] where he lays down all of you should
[1:09:35] Mark that spot where Christ was
[1:09:37] crucified
[1:09:39] and therefore we must be crucified with
[1:09:42] him
[1:09:47] when he sees her he tells her stay here
[1:09:51] until the rising of the sun Ruth then
[1:09:55] rested in the promise of her Kinsmen
[1:09:57] Redeemer
[1:10:00] and we are resting in the work of our
[1:10:02] Kinsmen Redeemer also
[1:10:07] Ruth became heir to everything that Boaz
[1:10:10] owned
[1:10:12] and the bride becomes join Heirs of
[1:10:15] Christ
[1:10:18] a woman can only have inheritance
[1:10:22] through the Union
[1:10:24] with her husband
[1:10:27] it is that Union
[1:10:29] that makes her heir to his kingdom
[1:10:34] it is your union to Jesus Christ
[1:10:38] that makes you join heirs with Jesus and
[1:10:41] by your spiritual union to your husband
[1:10:45] you become one with him
[1:10:48] and the two become
[1:10:50] one flesh
[1:10:54] listen to this by that Union
[1:10:57] his virtue Becomes Her virtue
[1:11:01] his righteousness Becomes Her
[1:11:04] righteousness
[1:11:06] his Holiness Becomes Her holiness
[1:11:10] and his perfection
[1:11:13] Becomes Her perfection
[1:11:16] for she is his glory
[1:11:22] in The Invisible Union of the bride of
[1:11:24] Christ you're standing completely you
[1:11:27] never sinned it the first place
[1:11:29] God don't even know it's in the sea of
[1:11:33] forgetfulness you never did it
[1:11:35] you were accused of it by the Accuser
[1:11:39] but really from the beginning you were
[1:11:42] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:11:44] of God
[1:11:46] you're standing washed the old book of
[1:11:49] your divorcement is put away
[1:11:52] it's dead absolutely out of existence
[1:11:54] out of the very mind of God
[1:11:58] You're The Virtuous bride of Christ
[1:12:01] washed in the blood of Christ precious
[1:12:05] virtuous sinless Son of God standing
[1:12:08] with appear unadulterated bright word
[1:12:11] that he has washed her by the water of
[1:12:15] his own blood
[1:12:16] that become flesh and manifested that he
[1:12:21] might take you which were predestinated
[1:12:23] in the bosom of the father before the
[1:12:26] beginning the same as he was
[1:12:30] a virtuous woman is a jewel in a man's
[1:12:34] crown
[1:12:36] brother Branham says in my life story to
[1:12:39] see a good woman is a jewel in a man's
[1:12:41] crown
[1:12:42] she should be honored
[1:12:45] she's one of the best things that God
[1:12:47] could give a man
[1:12:49] a wife besides salvation a wife
[1:12:53] is the best thing if she is a good wife
[1:12:56] but if she isn't isn't
[1:12:58] Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in
[1:13:02] a man's crown but an honorary one or no
[1:13:06] good one is water in his blood
[1:13:09] and that's right it's the worst thing
[1:13:11] could happen
[1:13:12] so a good woman if you've got a good
[1:13:15] wife brother you ought to respect her
[1:13:18] with the highest
[1:13:19] and children if you've got a real mother
[1:13:22] that stays home and tries to take care
[1:13:25] of you and keeping your clothes clean
[1:13:27] send your kids to school teaching you
[1:13:30] about Jesus you should honor that sweet
[1:13:33] old mother with all that's in you you
[1:13:36] should respect that woman yes sir
[1:13:38] because she's a real mother
[1:13:43] when you break the backbone of
[1:13:45] motherhood you break the backbone of a
[1:13:47] Nation
[1:13:50] today this perverted work uh woke
[1:13:53] generation has desecrated the office of
[1:13:57] a mother
[1:13:59] let me say that when I speak of a woman
[1:14:01] or a character in her virtue I'm
[1:14:04] actually speaking of the church
[1:14:06] because a woman in scripture is always
[1:14:09] refers to as the church
[1:14:11] Ephesians 5 32 this is a great mystery
[1:14:16] I speak concerning Christ and the church
[1:14:20] the first example of a woman to become a
[1:14:24] mother in the Bible was he
[1:14:26] in Genesis 3 and 20 Adam called his
[1:14:29] wife's name Eve because she was the
[1:14:33] mother of all living
[1:14:35] now listen to this for a moment
[1:14:39] she is called the mother of all living
[1:14:41] but Adam is not called the father of all
[1:14:46] living
[1:14:47] brother Brennan picks us up in the
[1:14:49] Ephesian Church age
[1:14:51] he says scripture does not play with
[1:14:53] words
[1:14:55] whatever is in the record is there for
[1:14:58] the United ones eyes to see
[1:15:01] it's there for a purpose Genesis 3 20
[1:15:05] and Adam called his wife's name Eve
[1:15:08] because she was the mother of all living
[1:15:10] but no scripture says that Adam is the
[1:15:14] father of all living
[1:15:16] see
[1:15:18] the fact is that through Eve was the
[1:15:21] mother of all living but Adam was not
[1:15:24] the father
[1:15:25] of all living all of humanity that you
[1:15:29] see crawling all over this Earth
[1:15:32] today
[1:15:34] is a product of a fallen woman
[1:15:45] the role of a mother today has been so
[1:15:48] diminished and put down
[1:15:51] that for a woman to say that she's a
[1:15:53] stay-at-home mom
[1:15:55] she's looked upon as a second-class
[1:15:58] citizen
[1:16:01] Godly Parents who care
[1:16:04] about what is being taught to their
[1:16:06] children in our schools today are
[1:16:08] labeled
[1:16:10] domestic terrorists
[1:16:14] call it whatever you want but I and
[1:16:17] every Godly mother and father are
[1:16:20] interested in what is being taught to
[1:16:22] your children
[1:16:24] and we've let all of these perverted
[1:16:27] politicians and government officials and
[1:16:30] teachers and lbgq2 WXYZ
[1:16:35] because they keep adding to it let me
[1:16:37] tell you it's nothing but a perversion
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:44] God help us
[1:16:48] and Godly mother is perhaps one of the
[1:16:50] most important jobs
[1:16:52] that is within all of Christianity a
[1:16:55] Godly mother
[1:16:58] if more mothers did their job correctly
[1:17:02] be a whole lot easier on us pastors
[1:17:07] easier for the teachers in the classroom
[1:17:10] come on teachers Say Amen
[1:17:13] yeah
[1:17:15] easier for the policemen on the streets
[1:17:20] but in order to really see and
[1:17:23] appreciate a true mother you have to see
[1:17:25] the law of contrast
[1:17:28] you don't really appreciate a good one
[1:17:31] until you've seen a bad one
[1:17:34] on one side you have the virtuous
[1:17:37] virgin bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:41] on the other side you have Jezebel
[1:17:45] a religious woman
[1:17:47] called the Great and mother of
[1:17:49] harlots in the Book of Revelation
[1:17:52] the Bible is filled of examples of good
[1:17:55] Mothers as well as those of bad mothers
[1:18:01] just because you're able to conceive a
[1:18:04] child
[1:18:05] does not make you a mother
[1:18:09] or for a man
[1:18:11] to produce seed and Pregnant a woman
[1:18:15] does not give him the honor of being a
[1:18:19] father
[1:18:22] you have may have birthed the child
[1:18:25] but are you a mother
[1:18:28] you have me you may have gotten a girl
[1:18:31] pregnant
[1:18:33] but we'll be you be a father to that
[1:18:36] child
[1:18:37] the majority of the young people in
[1:18:39] America today and around the world
[1:18:42] come from a lopsided Parenthood
[1:18:46] a one parent
[1:18:51] isn't it amazing that some people today
[1:18:56] here in America do not want to be called
[1:18:58] mother they want to be called parent
[1:19:01] number two
[1:19:03] or a
[1:19:05] birthing person
[1:19:08] well that's about right they're just a
[1:19:10] birthing person
[1:19:12] they're not a mother
[1:19:13] they just birthed
[1:19:17] oh my watch this
[1:19:20] brother Branham said in the invasion of
[1:19:22] the United States by listen this was one
[1:19:26] of his Mother's Day sermons
[1:19:30] 1954 invasion of the United States your
[1:19:35] mother if you want to do something for
[1:19:37] her you do it uh
[1:19:39] 365 days a year
[1:19:42] go to her house offer prayer and live
[1:19:44] for God
[1:19:46] that's the real Spirit of motherhood and
[1:19:49] the real Spirit of Mother's Day Mother's
[1:19:51] Day is 365 days a year come on Church
[1:19:55] Say Amen
[1:19:57] it's not just today that we give her a
[1:20:00] rose it's not today that we praise her
[1:20:03] she should be praised every day if you
[1:20:06] have a Godly mother you should kiss her
[1:20:09] cheek you should thank her and you when
[1:20:12] you see you go out the door you realize
[1:20:14] that everything that was ever placed
[1:20:17] within you the foundation of your
[1:20:19] teaching started with Mama
[1:20:23] the first one to hold you the first one
[1:20:25] to tell you right and wrong was mama
[1:20:34] and the teaching on Moses again one of
[1:20:36] brother brennam's Mother's Day sermons
[1:20:40] he says now there's nothing any sweeter
[1:20:42] on Earth that we know of than a real
[1:20:45] genuine mother God bless her Gallant
[1:20:48] Soul a real real mother but we got so
[1:20:51] many substitutes today that's called
[1:20:55] mother that's not a mother they're just
[1:20:57] women who have children
[1:21:00] they're just my he said they're they're
[1:21:03] they're they're not mothers
[1:21:05] they call them today birthing parent
[1:21:08] they're not a month they didn't they
[1:21:10] don't even have the class
[1:21:14] to be called a mother
[1:21:17] an old-fashioned mother is one who cares
[1:21:19] for her family and don't lay out on
[1:21:21] these lounges and dances all night long
[1:21:24] smoke and drinking and come in she don't
[1:21:27] deserve that sacred name of mother
[1:21:30] she's just a woman that's all
[1:21:33] that's raising a child
[1:21:35] but not a mother because a mother has
[1:21:37] got a different meaning to it somebody
[1:21:40] say Amen
[1:21:41] I'm blessing you Godly mothers this
[1:21:44] morning
[1:21:45] Now understand that the devil fights
[1:21:48] Godly mothers
[1:21:51] and the Battlefront that all of you
[1:21:53] mothers will face will be with your
[1:21:55] children
[1:21:58] so you better take and put into their
[1:22:01] little virgin Minds when they are little
[1:22:03] and Young
[1:22:05] you start telling them of the love of
[1:22:07] God you start telling them about a god
[1:22:10] whom they should serve and not the God
[1:22:14] of this age and not the god of fashion
[1:22:17] and the God of all of uh that's in the
[1:22:20] world because we know there is a God of
[1:22:23] this world but Jesus said my kingdom is
[1:22:26] not of this world if it were of this
[1:22:29] world I would send angels to fight
[1:22:39] the Battlefront rages within message
[1:22:43] mothers hearts even today
[1:22:47] the life of Abraham had to come through
[1:22:49] Sarah
[1:22:51] she was the channel for the Nations to
[1:22:54] come through her
[1:22:57] God gave the promise to Abraham but that
[1:23:00] promise was to be manifest in Sarah
[1:23:04] God sent the word to brother Branham
[1:23:07] but the word is to be manifested in the
[1:23:10] bride
[1:23:12] if you can destroy motherhood you have
[1:23:14] destroyed a nation
[1:23:16] you have broken the backbone of a Nation
[1:23:22] the brother Branham said in 1954 Imagine
[1:23:25] This
[1:23:26] the backbone of Any Nation is Womanhood
[1:23:30] when it comes to morals and you break
[1:23:33] down motherhood you broke down your
[1:23:35] nation
[1:23:37] a young man tried to find a wife that's
[1:23:40] even a virgin
[1:23:41] that's moral he'd have to go around some
[1:23:45] little old Holy Ghost Church almost to
[1:23:48] find one and that's exactly right where
[1:23:52] a man just keep her uh in and things
[1:23:55] like that got a little decency about her
[1:23:59] God give us Godly Parents that'll watch
[1:24:03] over our children and instill into their
[1:24:07] little minds and Mama I say it starts
[1:24:10] with you mother teach your children
[1:24:14] those things of God
[1:24:18] I want to share with you at this moment
[1:24:20] some of the words of Jesus that I
[1:24:23] believe are being fulfilled in this day
[1:24:26] Matthew 10 verses 34 through 38 think
[1:24:30] not that I am come to send peace on
[1:24:32] Earth
[1:24:35] I came not to send peace
[1:24:39] but a sword
[1:24:42] and I am calm to set a man at variance
[1:24:45] against his father
[1:24:47] and the daughter against her mother
[1:24:50] and the daughter-in-law against her
[1:24:52] mother-in-law
[1:24:54] and a man's foes
[1:24:57] shall be they of their own household
[1:25:03] he that loveth father or mother more
[1:25:07] than me is not worthy of me
[1:25:09] and he that loveth his son or daughter
[1:25:11] more than me is not worthy of me
[1:25:15] and he taketh
[1:25:17] not of his cross and followeth after me
[1:25:20] is not worthy of me
[1:25:23] we're in an age when children are
[1:25:25] becoming disobedient to their parents
[1:25:27] young people today have little or no
[1:25:30] respect for their elders and they rebel
[1:25:33] against any kind of Correction and godly
[1:25:35] instruction
[1:25:37] proverbs 30 verse 11 says there is a
[1:25:40] generation that curses their father and
[1:25:43] does not bless their mother boy if we're
[1:25:45] in that generation it's now
[1:25:51] Leviticus 19 Verse 3 says you shall fear
[1:25:55] every man his mother
[1:25:57] and his father but I'll tell you what
[1:26:00] how many of you
[1:26:02] had a mother that listen she didn't
[1:26:04] mince her words
[1:26:06] she didn't play around with you
[1:26:11] there is something about a mother
[1:26:13] that'll correct her children and When
[1:26:15] Mama's voice changes
[1:26:17] that little child knows
[1:26:21] and just doesn't call his name but calls
[1:26:24] his whole name Ronald Allen Peterson I
[1:26:28] knew rate 10. I would stop in my tracks
[1:26:31] whatever I'm doing
[1:26:34] because mom my my mother never even
[1:26:38] liked us to have that look like
[1:26:42] you better wipe that smile off your face
[1:26:45] son I'm I'm fixing a cloud up and storm
[1:26:49] all over you
[1:26:51] yeah how many of you had a Godly mother
[1:26:54] that when she pointed her finger and
[1:26:56] told you sit down you sat down you
[1:26:59] didn't sit there and argue
[1:27:03] one man said you're my Offspring and if
[1:27:06] you don't obey you can spring off
[1:27:16] a man should fear his mother
[1:27:23] Exodus 21 verse 15 he that smiteth his
[1:27:27] father or his mother shall surely be put
[1:27:29] to death
[1:27:32] we're in a time when this prophecy is
[1:27:34] being fulfilled
[1:27:35] children becoming so disobedient to
[1:27:37] parents
[1:27:39] children that's the age of rebellion
[1:27:42] this is a time when the children have
[1:27:45] you noticed more and more children are
[1:27:47] killing their parents so they can have
[1:27:49] uh the money for Mom and Dad
[1:27:52] from Mom and Dad they didn't earn it
[1:27:57] a bunch of spoiled rotten little brats
[1:28:00] I tell you what you mothers and fathers
[1:28:03] better teach your children
[1:28:04] the right moral issues
[1:28:07] the value of a dollar
[1:28:09] give you think that you love your
[1:28:11] children you just give them everything
[1:28:13] that they want
[1:28:14] that's not what God does I think you
[1:28:17] ought to do the way that God does God
[1:28:20] doesn't give you everything that you
[1:28:21] want he gets you what you need not what
[1:28:24] you want oh God I want a Lamborghini God
[1:28:27] I want to parse you I want a
[1:28:30] Mercedes-Benz and but you better be
[1:28:32] happy if he gives you a Volkswagen
[1:28:36] come on now
[1:28:39] proud and heady and high-minded give it
[1:28:43] to me and I want it now
[1:28:45] they'll never appreciate anything unless
[1:28:47] they've worked for it
[1:28:52] amen we're in the age of this prophecy
[1:28:54] being fulfilled
[1:28:57] all of our mothers and fathers are and
[1:29:02] will be tested in this area and guess
[1:29:04] who's going to test you
[1:29:06] that cute little baby that you just
[1:29:09] birthed
[1:29:11] you give it time
[1:29:14] and if you don't start correcting
[1:29:16] I was with some young people the other
[1:29:19] day
[1:29:21] and quite honestly you know what I think
[1:29:23] I need to do Growing Kids God's way
[1:29:26] again
[1:29:28] because we got a whole new crop of kids
[1:29:31] coming up
[1:29:32] and those kids are getting away with
[1:29:34] anything they want
[1:29:37] oh God help us because you don't start
[1:29:41] correcting that kid now
[1:29:44] then wait until he's a teenager and you
[1:29:49] tell him no
[1:29:53] God help us
[1:29:55] Genesis 28 verses 6 through 9.
[1:29:58] and when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed
[1:30:01] Jacob
[1:30:03] you remember he was a blessing given to
[1:30:05] Jacob
[1:30:06] and he sent him away to pandem arum
[1:30:10] to take him away from fence and that as
[1:30:13] he blessed him to give him a charge
[1:30:14] saying Thou shalt not take away from the
[1:30:18] daughters of Canaan this is a direct
[1:30:20] word from the father
[1:30:23] and Jacob obeyed his father and mother
[1:30:26] and has gone to pandem arum and Esau
[1:30:31] look at this here's Esau his own brother
[1:30:35] seeing that the daughters of Canaan
[1:30:37] please not Isaac his father
[1:30:40] then when
[1:30:41] then
[1:30:43] went to Esau unto Ishmael
[1:30:47] and took unto him wise
[1:30:50] which had was made last the daughter of
[1:30:53] ishmael's Abraham's son the sister and
[1:30:55] they bought to be his wife and do you
[1:30:57] did you know that the Bible says that
[1:31:00] Hagar had chosen Ishmael a wife from the
[1:31:04] land of Egypt
[1:31:06] takes one to no one
[1:31:08] hear Hagar a bonds woman
[1:31:12] goes and finds a bride for Ishmael the
[1:31:17] Bible says it in Genesis 21 verse 21 and
[1:31:20] he went and he went in the wilderness of
[1:31:23] Parham and his mother took him a wife
[1:31:25] out of the land of Egypt
[1:31:28] his mother picked
[1:31:30] his bride
[1:31:33] Abraham had his servant Ella eser
[1:31:37] to swear unto him to not take a wife to
[1:31:40] my son out of the land of Canaan
[1:31:43] Genesis 24 and Abraham said unto his
[1:31:46] eldest servant of his house that ruled
[1:31:49] over all that he had put I pray thee thy
[1:31:52] hand under my thigh
[1:31:54] and I will make thee swear by the Lord
[1:31:57] the god of Heaven and the god of the
[1:32:00] earth that thou shalt not take a wife
[1:32:02] under my son of the daughters of the
[1:32:05] Canaanites among whom I dwell
[1:32:09] but Thou shalt go into my country
[1:32:12] and to my kindred
[1:32:15] state of people that are within the
[1:32:17] message under no circumstance should a
[1:32:21] Believer go outside
[1:32:24] to look for a husband or a wife
[1:32:30] listen that's good for you
[1:32:32] and you listen to that you mothers and
[1:32:34] fathers you teach your children
[1:32:37] you get your daughter some interested in
[1:32:40] some nice looking boy out there
[1:32:43] and she comes up and say what do you
[1:32:45] think under no circumstance
[1:32:49] same way with the boy or the girl
[1:32:55] my daughter will remember
[1:32:58] she says Dad there was a young boy yeah
[1:33:00] he's he's kind of interested in me I
[1:33:02] said who is he
[1:33:04] she told me
[1:33:05] I said ain't no way
[1:33:09] no circumstance
[1:33:17] dads watch over your families
[1:33:20] bear carry a big stick
[1:33:24] yep
[1:33:26] yeah
[1:33:29] carry a club bazooka
[1:33:32] whatever you need man run them off
[1:33:37] I saw a t-shirt the other day said yeah
[1:33:40] I'm getting old
[1:33:42] and you young man don't forget you come
[1:33:44] around my daughter
[1:33:48] I don't mind doing something to you
[1:33:50] because I got many days left anyway
[1:34:00] that watch over their children huh
[1:34:04] go to Mike Kindred my people
[1:34:10] no matter how much you say you believe
[1:34:12] this message it's who you choose
[1:34:15] that is a reflection of what's inside
[1:34:18] you
[1:34:19] brother Branham not because we were
[1:34:21] talking about who can find a virtuous
[1:34:23] woman
[1:34:24] who has the ability who knows what to
[1:34:27] look for in a Godly Man or in a Godly
[1:34:30] woman
[1:34:31] so brother Brandon in a sermon and you
[1:34:34] all you young people you need to listen
[1:34:36] to choosing a bride
[1:34:41] the kind of a woman that man would
[1:34:43] choose reflects his ambition and his
[1:34:45] character
[1:34:46] if a man chooses the wrong woman it
[1:34:49] reflects his character and what he ties
[1:34:52] himself to
[1:34:53] it shows surely what's in him
[1:34:57] a woman reflects what's in the man when
[1:34:59] he chooses her for wife it shows what's
[1:35:03] down in him no matter what he says
[1:35:05] outside watch what he marries
[1:35:10] I don't care what he says I don't
[1:35:12] believe his testimony because his spirit
[1:35:15] is feeding on them things of the world
[1:35:19] what sayeth if he would marry a a a a
[1:35:22] chorus girl or what if he'd marry a sex
[1:35:26] queen or just some pretty modern
[1:35:29] ricketta it reflects it shows what he
[1:35:33] has in his mind
[1:35:36] by whatever she is that's what the way
[1:35:39] she'll raise those children
[1:35:42] so it reflects what's in the man
[1:35:45] a man that takes a woman like that just
[1:35:48] shows what he's thinking of the future
[1:35:52] a true Christian will not look for such
[1:35:55] beauty queens and chorus girls and sex
[1:35:59] Queens he'll look for Christian
[1:36:01] character
[1:36:04] Now understand this
[1:36:07] a man is going to choose a woman to
[1:36:10] reflect what is in him
[1:36:13] why then
[1:36:15] did God choose a virtuous woman
[1:36:19] before the foundation of the world while
[1:36:22] ye she was yet in his mind he was
[1:36:25] forming her
[1:36:27] she was already part of his attributes
[1:36:32] but he couldn't have fellowship with her
[1:36:35] until she became manifested In the Flesh
[1:36:38] and the bride today she will be his
[1:36:42] glory she will be his virtue she will be
[1:36:46] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[1:36:49] she will be the glory of God
[1:36:55] is not the woman the glory of the man
[1:37:06] Adam was made in the image of God
[1:37:10] and at first Adam that God had made was
[1:37:13] the spirit man and he hovered Over the
[1:37:15] Garden and there was no man to till the
[1:37:17] soil he was the spirit man he was made
[1:37:20] like God and guess what God was alone
[1:37:24] in the beginning God was alone with his
[1:37:28] attributes
[1:37:30] he wanted to have fellowship with like
[1:37:33] kind but there was none
[1:37:35] so God began in the womb of his mind he
[1:37:40] began to have these attributes these
[1:37:42] thoughts
[1:37:43] and it wasn't until he spoke the spoken
[1:37:47] word is what creates whenever God said
[1:37:50] let there be light there was light when
[1:37:52] God said let the Earth come forth come
[1:37:54] forth and so God spoke listen to this
[1:37:57] the prophet of God said this little
[1:37:59] bride God spoke your name
[1:38:02] before you there was Stardust before you
[1:38:06] ever came to this earth God spoke your
[1:38:09] name what was he doing creating a bride
[1:38:12] he was creating a bride out of his own
[1:38:15] spoken word that's why she is word of
[1:38:19] his word lying upon life here a little
[1:38:22] there a little
[1:38:35] Adam dwells alone with no other humans
[1:38:39] of his own kind
[1:38:42] no one to share with to share Eden
[1:38:46] so God created him a helpmate
[1:38:50] she was the hidden expression of Adam's
[1:38:53] desire what was in Adam's heart became
[1:38:57] manifest
[1:38:59] In the Flesh of Eve
[1:39:03] and when she came to Adam
[1:39:07] he called her
[1:39:09] whoa
[1:39:11] man
[1:39:13] what a beauty
[1:39:16] you catch that
[1:39:18] he called her Whoa man
[1:39:25] I'm just going to add living a little
[1:39:27] bit
[1:39:28] but it's no doubt he said
[1:39:32] I ain't never seen anything
[1:39:34] that is so attractive
[1:39:36] as what she is
[1:39:38] she is born of my bone
[1:39:42] she is me
[1:39:44] in that woman form
[1:39:47] amen because with listen to this you
[1:39:49] talk about the importance of a woman
[1:39:52] the importance of a woman
[1:39:54] the species dies
[1:39:58] if there is no other portion to
[1:40:01] reproduce that which is in the man
[1:40:04] the species dies
[1:40:07] unless there be somebody to reproduce it
[1:40:11] Hallelujah do you understand God had to
[1:40:14] have a bride
[1:40:15] or the god species dies
[1:40:19] God could not reproduce himself
[1:40:22] he had to have the portion of him
[1:40:26] that he created that he might have
[1:40:28] Fellowship
[1:40:35] without the bride there would be no
[1:40:37] further lineage of God
[1:40:40] he is not complete without her and she
[1:40:44] is not complete without him
[1:40:48] the two shall become one flesh
[1:40:51] in this perverted movement listen to me
[1:40:53] now let me bring some Modern events down
[1:40:57] in this perverted movement today where
[1:41:00] they say there's neither male nor female
[1:41:03] they they cannot
[1:41:04] differentiate they cannot even say it
[1:41:07] the smartest most intellectual even
[1:41:10] people of Medicine
[1:41:12] we will not Define what is a woman what
[1:41:16] is a man
[1:41:17] I tell you they've lost their minds
[1:41:23] now watch what they're producing
[1:41:25] seedless children
[1:41:28] unable to reproduce
[1:41:30] they are mentally mutilating their mind
[1:41:34] first
[1:41:38] do you know on the door of every
[1:41:41] bathroom
[1:41:42] universally around the world
[1:41:45] shows the sticks figure of a woman
[1:41:49] and she's got a dress on
[1:41:53] I don't care what country you go to
[1:41:56] there it is universal sign woman Dress
[1:41:59] Man pants
[1:42:06] yeah
[1:42:07] it's too simple
[1:42:10] now watch this
[1:42:12] transgender thinking
[1:42:15] defiles and mutilates the minds first
[1:42:20] and creates them a genderless
[1:42:24] people
[1:42:29] if you have no gender identity
[1:42:32] you do not have the basic ingredient of
[1:42:36] Who You Are
[1:42:38] where you belong or what is your purpose
[1:42:42] remember now it's a mental mutilation
[1:42:47] starting in the mind first because how
[1:42:51] did Satan get to Eve first he seduced
[1:42:54] her with words in her mind he mutilated
[1:42:57] her thought her womb was defiled instead
[1:43:02] of taking God's word by believing only
[1:43:04] God's word
[1:43:07] he came and used to reasoning
[1:43:11] isn't this woke generation using the
[1:43:15] channel of reasoning
[1:43:23] Eve said
[1:43:25] because God said what happened Eve
[1:43:28] the serpent
[1:43:30] he beguiled me do you know what the word
[1:43:32] beguiled mean
[1:43:34] it means to seduce with words
[1:43:38] the serpent he beguiled me
[1:43:41] and I did eat
[1:43:43] you either the wrong thing you eat of
[1:43:45] the tree of knowledge
[1:43:47] that's why the biggest desecrated place
[1:43:50] in the world today is a university
[1:43:53] it's a tree of knowledge
[1:43:56] and you just go around a university
[1:43:58] today and you will see every kind of
[1:44:01] immoral
[1:44:05] not knowing who they are what gender
[1:44:07] they are
[1:44:08] it's because somebody started telling
[1:44:10] them when they were little
[1:44:13] brother Branham even went so far as to
[1:44:15] say you mothers don't you put those
[1:44:17] little Beetle haircuts on your boys keep
[1:44:20] their bangs out of their face and the
[1:44:22] hair off the back of their neck he said
[1:44:24] you'll make them little perverts
[1:44:28] boys do boys things
[1:44:30] girls do girl things don't give a doll
[1:44:33] to a boy
[1:44:35] give him a truck
[1:44:45] don't give a truck to a girl
[1:44:48] give her a doll
[1:44:51] then she's going to take care of that
[1:44:52] doll it's funny watch uh
[1:44:55] you ever seen a a a little girl tell her
[1:44:59] baby her little dolly dolly you better
[1:45:02] be
[1:45:04] listen to me
[1:45:08] huh
[1:45:13] I saw YouTube
[1:45:15] of a mother trying to feed her her
[1:45:18] little baby
[1:45:20] and and
[1:45:22] like this
[1:45:24] so she tries to feed the little uh dolly
[1:45:29] that is sitting next to her
[1:45:31] and of course the the little dolly
[1:45:33] doesn't do anything the mother takes his
[1:45:35] spoon quack
[1:45:37] it's that dolly
[1:45:39] Parton I said you're gonna eat
[1:45:43] takes his phone now comes over here
[1:45:51] you learn obedience
[1:45:54] by the things you suffer
[1:46:00] open up yeah
[1:46:06] mental seduction first
[1:46:08] he first took her mentally then he took
[1:46:13] her physically
[1:46:17] brother Ram said thy Tyrant Church age
[1:46:19] she is a dominating female
[1:46:23] now listen to me sisters
[1:46:27] brother Brenham says that a dominating
[1:46:30] female spirit is the seed of the Roman
[1:46:33] Catholic Church
[1:46:36] amen
[1:46:38] a dominating female
[1:46:42] you sisters be very careful because
[1:46:44] that's the age who is the god of America
[1:46:49] the woman
[1:46:51] you see now who all are being put into
[1:46:54] positions
[1:46:56] women
[1:47:01] and we've got a Mindless president
[1:47:06] who doesn't know where he's at
[1:47:08] if he didn't have a teller prompter in
[1:47:10] front of him he wouldn't even know what
[1:47:12] to say
[1:47:14] but God keep him alive
[1:47:18] because the second one behind him is
[1:47:22] a cackling idiot
[1:47:24] I'm sorry
[1:47:27] oh
[1:47:33] America is becoming a laughing star
[1:47:38] a dominating
[1:47:40] female she is a mystery Babylon the
[1:47:43] great
[1:47:44] she is Jezebel the false prophetess why
[1:47:47] because the true female is submissive to
[1:47:50] God doesn't that a true female who can
[1:47:53] find a virtuous woman he said a true
[1:47:56] female is submissive to God Christ is
[1:47:59] her head she has no word but his no
[1:48:01] thought be his no leadership but his but
[1:48:04] what about the church
[1:48:06] she has cast out the word destroyed the
[1:48:09] Bibles were the essays of The Godly and
[1:48:11] she has slain those who would preach the
[1:48:14] truth she has taken over Kings and
[1:48:16] princes and Nations controls armies
[1:48:19] and insists that she is the True Body of
[1:48:22] Christ and that her Popes are the
[1:48:24] Vickers of Christ she is entirely
[1:48:27] seduced by the devil until she in turn
[1:48:30] becomes the seducers of others
[1:48:33] she is the Bride of Satan
[1:48:36] and has produced his bastard child
[1:48:40] religion
[1:48:44] Adam was not deceived
[1:48:48] he knew what he was doing
[1:48:52] Christ knew exactly what his mission was
[1:48:54] when he came to Earth
[1:48:56] for this cause came I into the world
[1:48:59] that I might lay down my life for my
[1:49:02] sheep
[1:49:05] God could not kill Eve without killing
[1:49:08] Adam
[1:49:09] because God's seed laid inside a fallen
[1:49:15] Eve
[1:49:16] so these perverted teachers and woke
[1:49:19] mentors in control
[1:49:21] of our governments and our schools
[1:49:24] have taken and prescribed medications to
[1:49:28] children
[1:49:30] to change their sex hormone
[1:49:34] their bodies then become surgically
[1:49:37] mutilated
[1:49:39] to become seedless individuals
[1:49:44] a genderless generation
[1:49:46] is a seedless generation
[1:49:50] it is a sterile generation unable to
[1:49:55] reproduce itself now the prophet of God
[1:49:57] said watch
[1:49:59] during the time of the second world war
[1:50:03] pre-tribulation Spirits God upon three
[1:50:06] men
[1:50:07] Hitler mussolinian Eichmann and what did
[1:50:12] they do they wanted to genocide
[1:50:15] they wanted to sterilize they wanted to
[1:50:19] kill every Jew
[1:50:21] why because they were God's people with
[1:50:24] a promise
[1:50:26] you see Satan's after God's people
[1:50:31] and that's why he's trying to take the
[1:50:33] minds
[1:50:34] of our youth o God help our mothers to
[1:50:39] watch over the minds of their little
[1:50:41] children of what they see what they hear
[1:50:43] and what they feed their little Spirits
[1:50:45] upon
[1:50:54] Hitler Eichmann and Mussolini
[1:50:56] pre-tribulation spirits
[1:50:59] trying to genocide God's people
[1:51:06] it's happening
[1:51:10] it's called education
[1:51:13] it's called woke generation
[1:51:16] it's making them
[1:51:18] change their gender
[1:51:21] and when they do they mutilate their
[1:51:23] bodies
[1:51:24] you understand I'm talking adult
[1:51:26] language now
[1:51:28] they're mutilating them
[1:51:30] so that they could never have children
[1:51:37] with a seedless
[1:51:40] generation
[1:51:44] brother random said
[1:51:46] in choosing of a bride
[1:51:49] there might be one girl that's real
[1:51:50] pretty and the other one well her
[1:51:52] stature looks better than this one
[1:51:55] and you might have a sacrifice one over
[1:51:57] the other but if she's not a stature of
[1:52:00] a lady or a woman I don't care whether
[1:52:03] she's pretty or not you better look at
[1:52:05] her character whether she's pretty or
[1:52:08] not pretty
[1:52:10] evening
[1:52:11] if a Christian would choose a wife he
[1:52:14] ought to choose a genuine born-again
[1:52:16] woman regardless of what she looks like
[1:52:20] it's what she is which makes her
[1:52:23] then again it reflects his own Godly
[1:52:25] character and reflects what's in his
[1:52:27] mind
[1:52:28] and what's going to be in the future and
[1:52:30] his family raised by a woman for the
[1:52:32] future plans that's why brother bran
[1:52:34] preaches choosing of a bride and then
[1:52:36] future home
[1:52:39] what he's doing is he's preparing a
[1:52:42] bride
[1:52:42] that he can have his own specie kind
[1:52:46] she's pregnated
[1:52:48] with his life
[1:52:50] do you understand
[1:52:52] that the bride of Christ will be the
[1:52:55] crowning glory of God himself
[1:52:59] she will be his glory
[1:53:02] she will be the jewels in this crown
[1:53:12] in the days of Sodom
[1:53:14] and Gamora so will it be in the coming
[1:53:17] of the
[1:53:18] son of man
[1:53:20] we have arised my my brother and sister
[1:53:24] brother REM says in the flashing red
[1:53:26] light of the sign of his coming I'm
[1:53:28] going over just some of my notes
[1:53:32] for the sake of time and you don't have
[1:53:33] it on the overhead here so you're going
[1:53:35] to have to go and find the archive
[1:53:37] sermon where they can show it to you and
[1:53:39] you can read these quotes
[1:53:41] 1963 the flashing red lights of the sign
[1:53:45] of his coming
[1:53:47] he said one of the most miserable things
[1:53:49] is to see a man or woman who has never
[1:53:52] accepted Christ
[1:53:54] I just live to be an old mossback church
[1:53:56] member meaner than Satan himself
[1:53:59] and see them out there with a crab it
[1:54:01] old something
[1:54:03] well I'll tell you I don't believe in
[1:54:05] that God never that's that's the
[1:54:06] horriblest crown
[1:54:08] that Satan can Crown a life with Satan
[1:54:12] can crown that life with a grouchy old
[1:54:16] woman about 60 or 70 years old with fat
[1:54:19] hanging down under her arms wrinkles all
[1:54:23] over her face and her hair bobbed up in
[1:54:26] four or five different colors and
[1:54:28] strutting herself down in a little pair
[1:54:30] of shorts if that ain't the crowning of
[1:54:33] Satan I never seen it some old crowded
[1:54:35] man
[1:54:40] fat hanging down under our wrinkles
[1:54:44] hair bobbed up four or five different
[1:54:46] colors
[1:54:48] sounds like somebody I saw at Costco the
[1:54:50] other day
[1:54:53] if that ain't the crowning of Satan
[1:54:57] you see the false bride
[1:55:01] is the crowning of Satan's Glory
[1:55:11] there is nothing more comforting
[1:55:14] as the comfort you get from your mother
[1:55:18] even God Likens his love
[1:55:22] to Jerusalem as that of the Comfort love
[1:55:25] of a mother Isaiah 63 13 says
[1:55:29] that's one whom his mother comforteth so
[1:55:34] will I comfort you
[1:55:39] listen do you remember when you got hurt
[1:55:41] as a kid
[1:55:42] you never went running for Dad
[1:55:45] dad didn't show you any sympathy
[1:55:49] no no
[1:55:50] when you wanted somebody to comfort you
[1:55:53] you wanted somebody to take care of you
[1:55:55] and somebody to kind of relate and yo

[1:56:13] Mama run up on her lapo come here to go
[1:56:16] home
[1:56:17] I remember my twin brother and I were
[1:56:20] out playing he falls down gets hurt you
[1:56:23] ever seen a kid that falls down and gets
[1:56:25] hurt he runs off I'm going home
[1:56:28] and he runs home the whole way not even

[1:56:46] even crying you waited wow but he
[1:56:51] is comforted by his mother
[1:56:56] s know how to comfort
[1:57:00] do you know that is a it is a proven
[1:57:02] factoring during war in the time of War
[1:57:05] when a man is mortally wounded and most
[1:57:08] of the men going to war are young men
[1:57:11] between 18 and 22.
[1:57:14] and when they get mortally wounded who
[1:57:16] do they ask for
[1:57:23] mama where are you
[1:57:27] the comfort that comes from a mama
[1:57:31] oh God give us
[1:57:33] mothers
[1:57:35] who can Comfort their children
[1:57:37] amen
[1:57:40] the entire the entire Book of Proverbs
[1:57:44] speaks about Godly mothers
[1:57:47] talks about their virtue
[1:57:50] if it were not for the wise counsel of
[1:57:53] Rebecca
[1:57:55] Jacob would have never gotten the
[1:57:57] birthright
[1:57:59] if Joshua bid
[1:58:02] the mother of Moses would have never
[1:58:06] told Moses he was a proper child
[1:58:11] the moment she had the vision first
[1:58:15] she taught Moses
[1:58:17] you are a Hebrew
[1:58:20] you are not the son of Pharaoh's
[1:58:23] daughter
[1:58:24] and he had instilled in his little mind
[1:58:29] and it didn't come up until he became a
[1:58:31] man and all of a sudden he saw two
[1:58:33] fighting
[1:58:35] he stood in the gap
[1:58:42] oh God
[1:58:45] if there had never been a
[1:58:48] Joshua
[1:58:50] the mother of Moses there had never been
[1:58:52] a Moses to deliver Israel
[1:58:56] if zobora
[1:58:58] would have not circumcised her son
[1:59:04] huh
[1:59:06] the God would have slain Moses
[1:59:09] if Rahab
[1:59:11] had not received the messengers into her
[1:59:15] home
[1:59:16] her whole family would not have been
[1:59:18] saved
[1:59:20] if it had not been for Esther
[1:59:23] to go before the king as the hazarus
[1:59:28] as a mediator
[1:59:31] the Jews would have been condemned to
[1:59:33] death
[1:59:35] if Mary
[1:59:38] had have not embraced the prophecy
[1:59:45] there would have been no birth of Jesus
[1:59:50] if there is no Bride for Jesus Christ
[1:59:55] there would be no finishing of the
[1:59:56] mystery of God
[1:59:58] there would be no final voice to the
[2:00:00] final age
[2:00:05] God bless
[2:00:07] our Godly mothers
[2:00:14] now as I began to study the message and
[2:00:16] everything that I do
[2:00:18] when I study the message
[2:00:20] I see through the prophets Ministry
[2:00:24] modern events made clear by prophecy
[2:00:28] because he now as a prophet
[2:00:32] Watchmen
[2:00:34] what of the night
[2:00:38] how goes it ye who stand upon the wall
[2:00:45] and he sees the Watchman sees way off in
[2:00:47] the future
[2:00:48] he can see what's coming before it comes
[2:00:54] the very first sermon that the prophet
[2:00:56] mentions Mother's Day 19 and 54.
[2:01:01] he preaches the invasion of the USA
[2:01:06] the last time he mentions Mother's Day
[2:01:09] in a sermon
[2:01:11] 1963 he preaches the world
[2:01:14] is falling apart
[2:01:18] a season of the future
[2:01:20] he sees something in his embryonic form
[2:01:23] before it comes to maturity
[2:01:30] 1954 this is the invasion of the USA
[2:01:33] brother Ram said what is it it's the
[2:01:36] devil
[2:01:37] the invasion's on
[2:01:40] I ain't saying nothing about this
[2:01:42] individual or that individual
[2:01:44] I'm saying it's unclean spirits
[2:01:47] that are possessing the people driving
[2:01:50] them into it
[2:01:52] the inphasium the United States the
[2:01:55] overthrow of the church the church is
[2:01:57] overthrowed by the devil
[2:02:00] it's invaded it's invaded our Nations
[2:02:04] it's invaded the United States
[2:02:07] imagine him preaching this 1954.
[2:02:12] but the invasion of the United States
[2:02:15] the devil has took her over don't be
[2:02:18] afraid to rush you Russia ain't got
[2:02:20] nothing to do
[2:02:22] we're doing it to ourselves our own
[2:02:24] rottenness right Among Us
[2:02:26] motherhood has been broken mothers don't
[2:02:28] stay at home no more with their children
[2:02:31] like they used to they got to have a job
[2:02:38] in closing no musicians if you come
[2:02:45] if you were raised by a Godly mother she
[2:02:47] instilled unto you much of your
[2:02:49] character
[2:02:50] and your attitudes in life
[2:02:53] sisters listen carefully
[2:02:57] chances are the way your mother served
[2:03:00] your father
[2:03:03] is the way you will serve your husband
[2:03:09] when a woman forgets or neglects her
[2:03:12] position as a mother
[2:03:15] and to help me she's out of the will of
[2:03:18] God
[2:03:20] she is not a doormat she is not a Slave
[2:03:25] she is not to be locked into the kitchen
[2:03:27] or chained to the bedroom
[2:03:32] her position is at home serving her
[2:03:34] husband
[2:03:35] and raising a family
[2:03:37] and teaching those little children the
[2:03:41] ways of God
[2:03:43] our newspapers today are filled with
[2:03:46] stories of men and women who have had
[2:03:48] children whom they never wanted
[2:03:51] they never cherish they never nurtured
[2:03:55] the child was often abused unloved and
[2:03:57] withdrawn into a world of personal
[2:03:59] isolation
[2:04:02] understanding what love is
[2:04:05] excuse me misunderstanding what true
[2:04:07] love is because this woman that birthed
[2:04:10] him
[2:04:12] never made him feel special
[2:04:18] never kissed his wounds
[2:04:22] Never singing to sleep
[2:04:26] never told him how special he was
[2:04:30] a job that is so important
[2:04:34] God places into the hands of a mother
[2:04:41] she sets the building blocks of
[2:04:43] character in a person's life
[2:04:49] if you want to find greatness
[2:04:53] don't look at the throne
[2:04:56] look at the Cradle
[2:04:59] and who rocks it
[2:05:10] they say whoever Rocks the Cradle
[2:05:13] rules the world
[2:05:20] my God
[2:05:23] how important
[2:05:27] is a real Godly mother
[2:05:30] to the church
[2:05:37] who can find a virtuous woman
[2:05:41] where is she her her price is far
[2:05:45] above rubies
[2:05:48] brother random says in the sermon
[2:05:50] ashamed
[2:05:52] surely there's something in this word
[2:05:54] from Genesis to revelation
[2:05:57] that some character in there that you
[2:05:59] dealt with
[2:06:00] would be on the same basis that would be
[2:06:03] my question
[2:06:10] he said father
[2:06:13] somebody in this Bible
[2:06:18] I know there's somebody just like me
[2:06:20] that has a special purpose
[2:06:23] God I want you to show me
[2:06:25] here's what he said I closed my eyes
[2:06:28] just let the Bible fall open
[2:06:31] my finger on the scripture Genesis 24 7.
[2:06:36] Ella easer Abraham's faithful servant
[2:06:39] the model servant of the Bible
[2:06:41] being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac
[2:06:45] chills wrong all over me
[2:06:48] sure that's
[2:06:50] right with the rest of my message
[2:06:51] pulling out her Pride
[2:06:54] just a perfect message back to the word
[2:06:57] get that bride
[2:06:59] that's a duty that's what I'm here for
[2:07:02] that's what I'm trying to do
[2:07:06] is to call out a bride
[2:07:10] that's what this message is all about
[2:07:13] is finding
[2:07:16] I've heard you as a woman
[2:07:19] you mothers
[2:07:21] if your Godly mothers and have Godly
[2:07:23] character you teach your children
[2:07:28] because you are the backbone of this
[2:07:31] church you are the backbone of this
[2:07:33] nation no wonder this nation is going
[2:07:36] down so quickly because
[2:07:39] the role of true motherhood is gone it's
[2:07:43] desecrated
[2:07:45] to even care what your children read and
[2:07:48] learn in school you are labeled a
[2:07:50] domestic terrorist
[2:07:55] a domestic terrorist
[2:08:05] there will be nobody that fights for
[2:08:07] their children like a mother
[2:08:11] huh
[2:08:17] yeah just walk in the woods sometimes
[2:08:19] find a couple
[2:08:21] little cuddly looking little bear cubs
[2:08:23] come out there and they're kind of
[2:08:25] playing and Oh Come here little cubby
[2:08:28] come here let me play with you let me
[2:08:31] take you home I'd like to take you home
[2:08:33] and all of a sudden
[2:08:37] [Music]
[2:08:41] somebody sent me a clip of a little bear
[2:08:43] cub that is being chased by a mountain
[2:08:45] lion
[2:08:46] this is this got one of the highest
[2:08:49] Awards of
[2:08:53] of
[2:08:54] cinematography in the world
[2:08:57] and this lion is chasing a little bear
[2:08:59] cub and the little bear Cubbies he's
[2:09:02] just running away and he's running as
[2:09:04] fast he can he goes across a river and
[2:09:06] he goes up climbs a tree and he climbs
[2:09:08] out onto the limb or excuse me out onto
[2:09:10] a tree trying to get away from this lion
[2:09:14] and he's on the the end of this tree
[2:09:18] and the lion
[2:09:21] like this and it's it's swiping you can
[2:09:24] see the blood
[2:09:26] it's hitting this little bear cup and a
[2:09:28] little bear cub all of a sudden it just
[2:09:30] falls into the river part of the the log
[2:09:33] or the limb of the tree it falls down
[2:09:36] into the river and the lion follows it
[2:09:40] down knowing that that bear cubs got to
[2:09:43] come to get out of the water and when it
[2:09:45] does the little bear cup now is backed
[2:09:48] up to where hey I've got to fight and so
[2:09:51] he's he's trying to make himself as big
[2:09:54] and as ferocious as he can and he's
[2:09:57] trying to give out that Roar
[2:10:01] the lion is swiping him and the line is
[2:10:04] ready to give and all of a sudden the
[2:10:07] lion
[2:10:08] the mountain lion gives up and runs away
[2:10:11] and a little bear cub yeah
