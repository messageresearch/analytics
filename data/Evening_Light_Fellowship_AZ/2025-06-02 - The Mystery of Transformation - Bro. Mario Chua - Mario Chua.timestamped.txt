[8:08] report this morning. Sister Becky
[8:10] Manard. She says, "We want to thank the
[8:12] Lord for the miracle of my
[8:14] sister-in-law, Lorie Snow, being
[8:16] released from the hospital tomorrow
[8:18] after 8 weeks. She will be going to
[8:20] rehab in Seattle, Washington. That's
[8:22] what her insurance has approved. Let's
[8:25] please continue to keep her in our
[8:26] prayers for a complete healing to be
[8:29] able to walk again and of course come
[8:31] back home." So thankful for what the
[8:33] Lord has done for Sister Lori. Pray the
[8:35] Lord just continue to move on the scene
[8:36] for her.
[8:38] Sister Isabelle will be traveling
[8:42] to Ken Nairobi, Kenya on Tuesday the 3
[8:46] for her mother's funeral which will be
[8:47] on Friday. So we want to pray for sister
[8:50] Isabelle. Pray the Lord go with her.
[8:52] Pray for all those that are still at
[8:54] camp. We believe they'll be coming home
[8:55] later today and had a chance to listen
[8:57] to a couple of the service. The Lord has
[8:59] been moving and blessing the young
[9:00] people there and they're not here this
[9:03] morning, but you don't have to be a
[9:04] young person to praise the Lord. So
[9:06] expect everybody to fill in the gap this
[9:08] morning and lift your voices and worship
[9:11] and praise. Brother Andy, if you would
[9:12] come this morning and just take us
[9:14] before the Lord. Brother Mario will be
[9:16] ministering this morning. Pray the Lord
[9:17] would use him. If you have a need this
[9:19] morning, if you just want to lift before
[9:21] the Lord as brother Andy would take us
[9:22] to the Lord in prayer. Amen. Thank
[9:25] you. I failed to get Mark the prayer
[9:30] request. Uh Robert knew, but Robert
[9:32] wasn't here. Um, my poor daughter-in-law
[9:35] bursting
[9:36] pregnant. Steven's away at camp. Her car
[9:39] was stolen last
[9:41] night. And
[9:43] uh, just pray she'd be calm. And
[9:46] Steven's on his way back from camp. He
[9:48] was the camp nurse this year, but she
[9:51] was pretty uh, distressed. But God
[9:53] knows. Amen. Let's all go to him in
[9:56] prayer. Lord, we thank you
[10:00] for you spread your wings over us,
[10:05] Lord. Lord, sometimes things that we
[10:08] think matter so much, they really don't,
[10:12] but yet they still can trouble us, Lord.
[10:14] The issues in this life,
[10:18] uh Lord, we we know that your
[10:23] promises, they're more than words.
[10:28] Lord, you're life to us. Yes, Lord.
[10:32] Lord, we're resting in that.
[10:35] And Lord, if we can rest, we don't
[10:37] worry. That's right. Lord, we can
[10:42] stand. Doesn't matter if the ground is
[10:45] shaking, the fires are burning, if our
[10:49] car gets
[10:50] stolen, Lord, it just doesn't matter.
[10:53] Lord, we ask today, Lord, meet the needs
[10:55] of your people. Father, we we ask for
[10:58] you to just turn every request and every
[11:01] heart into a praise report, Lord. Lord,
[11:04] Lord, we are a peculiar people. We
[11:08] expect peculiar, miraculous things to
[11:11] happen, Lord, because we're yours
[11:14] and you want good things for us. Thank
[11:17] you, Lord. So today, I pray you'd give
[11:19] us something good. Let us take it out
[11:22] when we leave. May we just shine
[11:26] brighter as as your children in this
[11:28] dying and dark world. Lord, bless the
[11:30] minister that speaks and the hearer.
[11:32] Lord, let us go out of of this place
[11:35] boldly knowing that you met with us. We
[11:38] ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[11:42] Thank you, brother Andy. You may be
[11:44] seated this morning. It's good to see
[11:46] everyone out in the house of the Lord
[11:47] this morning. We just welcome each one.
[11:49] If you're visiting or streaming on the
[11:51] internet this morning, we welcome you.
[11:53] And got a note here. Sister Suzanne
[11:56] says, "I want to wish my amazing husband
[11:57] a happy birthday." So, happy birthday to
[12:00] brother Amos this morning. Amen. Saw him
[12:02] in the back. Didn't realize it was his
[12:04] birthday, but appreciate brother Amos
[12:06] and pray Lord just bless him today.
[12:08] Amen. Are you happy this morning? Man,
[12:10] you asked me why I'm happy. My sins are
[12:12] gone this morning. Let's lift our voices
[12:14] and sing that this morning. Praise the
[12:18] Lord. You ask me why I'm happy, so I'll
[12:23] just tell you why.
[12:25] Because my sins are
[12:27] [Music]
[12:31] gone. Who ask me where they are? I
[12:36] say my sins are
[12:39] gone. They're underneath the blood of
[12:43] the cross of Calvary.
[12:45] as far removed as darkness is from
[12:49] dawn. In the sea of God's
[12:52] forgetfulness, good enough for me.
[12:55] Praise
[12:57] God, my sins are gone.
[13:01] was at the old time altar where God came
[13:04] in my heart and
[13:10] [Music]
[13:13] now the devil did depart. I am glad my
[13:18] sins are
[13:20] gone. They're underneath the blood of
[13:24] the cross of
[13:25] Calvary. as far removed as darkness is
[13:29] from
[13:30] dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[13:34] That's good enough for me. Praise
[13:38] God. My sins are
[13:41] gone. When Satan comes to tempt me and
[13:45] he tries to make me doubt, I
[13:48] say, "My sins are gone.
[13:52] You got me into trouble, but Jesus got
[13:56] me out. I'm
[13:58] glad my sins are
[14:01] gone. There underneath the blood of the
[14:05] cross of
[14:07] Calvary. As far removed as darkness is
[14:10] from
[14:14] dawn. Getfulness that's good enough for
[14:17] me. Praise God.
[14:20] My sins are
[14:22] gone. I'm living now for Jesus. I'm
[14:26] happy night and day
[14:29] because my sins are
[14:32] gone. My soul is filled with music. With
[14:37] all my heart I say, I'm
[14:40] glad my sins are
[14:43] gone. They're underneath the blood of
[14:47] the cross of Calvary.
[14:49] as far removed as darkness is from
[14:53] dawn. In the sea of God's
[14:56] forgetfulness, good enough for me.
[14:59] Praise
[15:00] God. My sins sing the course again.
[15:04] There underneath the blood of the cross
[15:08] of
[15:09] Calvary. As far removed as darkness is
[15:12] from
[15:14] dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness.

[15:21] God, my sin. Praise
[15:24] God. Praise

[27:32] required. You search much deeper
[27:36] within through the way things appear.
[27:39] You're looking into my heart.
[27:46] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[27:52] And it's all about
[27:54] you. It's all about you,
[27:58] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the things
[28:03] I've made it when it's all about you.

[31:10] uh his
[31:12] confidence and I trust that the Lord
[31:15] will bless us again this morning. Amen.
[31:17] So we are not relying on our ideas or
[31:20] whatsoever. We're just relying upon the
[31:22] leading of the Holy Spirit of God. Amen.
[31:24] Thank you, Lord. 1 Corinthians chapter
[31:27] 15 verse 51, he said, "Behold, I show
[31:31] you a mystery.
[31:34] We shall not all asleep, but we shall
[31:37] all be changed. Hallelujah. In a moment,
[31:41] in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
[31:44] trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and
[31:47] the dead shall be raised
[31:49] incorruptible, and
[31:51] we shall be changed.
[31:55] For this corruptible must put on
[31:57] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[32:00] on immortality.
[32:02] And may the Lord add a blessing upon the
[32:04] reading of his word. You may now be
[32:05] seated.
[32:09] Amen. As uh there was a question uh to
[32:12] brother Brandham, what if uh asked what
[32:15] age do you like to
[32:17] be? And brother Brandham said, I would
[32:20] like to be in this generation. Amen. And
[32:23] this generation he call it the golden
[32:25] age.
[32:27] Amen. So we become this the golden age
[32:30] because this is where the mystery of God
[32:32] that was hidden in his mind before the
[32:34] foundation of the word was revealed in
[32:37] this generation. This is the golden age
[32:40] that the partial interpretation of word
[32:42] become a perfect interpretation of the
[32:44] word. Amen. And this is also praise God
[32:47] the golden age because mostly of the
[32:50] scripture that is being prophesied in
[32:52] this generation are almost fulfilled.
[32:54] Amen. So we are privileged to
[32:57] witness this past few months about the
[33:00] prophecy that is being fulfilled in our
[33:03] generation.
[33:05] So it really doesn't give us
[33:09] uh something the life must go on. We
[33:13] just enjoy the privilege that we are
[33:19] witness to the prophecy of a prophet in
[33:21] this generation. Amen. from last year up
[33:24] to this year. So we were in Italy when
[33:28] uh there was a election for a pope and
[33:32] uh my wife and son of brothers in Italy
[33:35] asked me who do you think will be the
[33:38] pope and I told them you what you didn't
[33:42] read the the the prophecy of the prophet
[33:45] of course the the pope will come from
[33:48] America. Amen. because it seems that
[33:51] America is not really in in
[33:54] uh the pope from America is not really
[33:56] in in uh
[33:58] something uh priorities right so when
[34:03] the pope
[34:04] was announced that it's from America so
[34:08] everybody was happy
[34:10] and the only thing that
[34:13] uh catch my attention when he was
[34:15] pronounced as a a prophet he used the
[34:18] word Leo the 14th. And I'm wondering why
[34:22] is it that he used the word Leo the 14
[34:26] cuz there's a lot of names that uh Leo
[34:31] and I told what the prophet said that
[34:33] the last sign
[34:35] of the first Bible was Leo the lion. The
[34:39] first was the virgin and the last was
[34:42] Leo the lion.
[34:44] And the prophet supposed that he will
[34:48] uh roar like a lion.
[34:51] So he will be roaring in these last
[34:53] days. Amen. And he used the number 14.
[34:57] And the prophet said there are 14 seven
[34:59] church ages of the old testament and
[35:01] seven church ages in the new testament.
[35:04] That's right. So this will be the
[35:05] culmination of all the scriptures.
[35:07] Hallelujah. And I think they said that
[35:09] for the first 2,000 years there's always
[35:12] there's the first American for last
[35:14] 2,000 years. So we are living in the
[35:16] last 2,000 years and after this we'll be
[35:20] looking for the changing of our bodies.
[35:22] Amen. So we it doesn't really uh give us
[35:28] something okay I will be faithful
[35:30] because this no the prophecy is already
[35:32] there. Our faithfulness is in the
[35:35] revealed word of the hour. Not by the
[35:37] prophecy that fulfilled. Oh, I saw this
[35:39] prophecy, so I need to do something in
[35:41] order for me to to add to my faith. No,
[35:45] revelation. It takes revelation. That's
[35:48] right. But we are just enjoying the
[35:49] prophecy that is being fulfilled in our
[35:51] day in this generation. So Paul here is
[35:54] speaking to the Corinthians about the
[35:57] mystery of the changing of our bodies.
[36:00] So mystery is previously hidden truth
[36:03] and uh if we read it in the first
[36:06] Corinthian the first the previous verses
[36:09] uh it's about the resurrection of
[36:11] Christ. So Paul is sharing to the
[36:14] Corinthians about the resurrection of
[36:16] Christ the resurrections of the dead and
[36:20] the change of the body. And I like how
[36:23] Paul presented in 1
[36:27] Corinthian 15:3 and he said, "And I
[36:31] deliver unto you first of all that which
[36:33] I also received." How that Christ died
[36:37] for our sins according to the scripture.
[36:40] So he's always pointing to the
[36:42] scripture. Amen. And and that he was
[36:44] buried and that he rose again the third
[36:47] day according to the scripture. Amen. So
[36:50] everything that we are doing here is
[36:52] according to the scripture. We are
[36:54] fulfilling scripture day by day in our
[36:57] lives. It's nothing happened by chance.
[37:00] Everything is written. Amen. Everything
[37:03] is recorded in heaven before it happens
[37:05] here.
[37:07] Hallelujah. So in in the Corinthian
[37:10] there are some Corinthian that don't
[37:11] believe in resurrection. And Paul said
[37:14] that how some say among you that there
[37:17] is no resurrection of the dead. And if
[37:20] there be no resurrection of the dead,
[37:22] then is Christ not risen. And if Christ
[37:26] be not risen, then is our preaching
[37:29] vain. And your faith is also in vain. So
[37:32] resurrection is very important to us.
[37:34] Yes sir. Because Christianity is based
[37:36] upon that burial and resurrection of
[37:39] Jesus Christ. Amen. And I believe that
[37:42] spiritually speaking, we are already
[37:44] resurrected
[37:46] and sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[37:48] Jesus. And some asked, what body will we
[37:54] have when we
[37:56] died? So Paul is speaking. He said,
[37:59] "Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall
[38:01] not we shall not all sleep." So
[38:06] meaning there will be people that will
[38:08] not die. Amen. Amen. But we shall all be
[38:13] changed. So the title of my sermon is
[38:17] the mystery of
[38:19] transformation with the subject of we
[38:21] shall all be
[38:24] changed. And in a moment in the
[38:26] twinkling of an eye. So our chain our
[38:30] body changes the the the the
[38:34] transformation is by the
[38:36] changing. It's just like a twinkling of
[38:38] an eye. Amen. So an eye is the seeing
[38:42] part of the body and in the body of
[38:45] Christ that is represented by a prophet.
[38:48] So without the prophet there could never
[38:50] be a body change. Amen. Because only
[38:54] this divine mystery truth will only turn
[38:57] the heart of our children back to the
[39:00] original faith and it will create a
[39:02] rapturing faith. So the eye of the body
[39:05] is represent the prophet in this last
[39:07] days. So if they don't believe that
[39:08] there is a prophet in these last days,
[39:10] I'm sorry for them. But the prophet was
[39:13] said only to those predestinated seed of
[39:15] God. Amen. So not everybody can receive
[39:18] the messenger in these last days. Not
[39:20] everybody can receive because it's only
[39:23] pointed to I will send Elijah to you. So
[39:26] this is a personal Amen. relationship
[39:29] with Christ. You need to recognize your
[39:31] day. You need to recognize who you are.
[39:35] Amen. By the by the way that you
[39:37] responds to the word of God, it shows
[39:39] that you are part of the prophecy in
[39:41] these last days. Amen. Hallelujah.
[39:46] Amen. Praise God. So the bride could not
[39:48] come or the body change could not come
[39:51] until the prophet of Malachi 4 has come
[39:53] on the scene. That is the purpose that
[39:55] God sent a prophet in these last days.
[39:58] Amen. for the changing of our bodies for
[40:01] the rapture for at the last trump and
[40:03] the trumpet gathers the people. So the
[40:06] trumpet is always in the Old Testament
[40:09] is always the gathering of the people
[40:11] and we know that there's always a lot of
[40:13] gathering. The time of Luther is the
[40:16] gathering of in the time of Luther there
[40:18] was a gathering under the uh the the the
[40:22] the sounding of Luther which is the Jess
[40:25] and Levi faith then the sounding of
[40:27] Wesley they're gathering together and
[40:30] and and and Wesley praise God present
[40:34] that not only we are justified we need
[40:37] to be sanctified we need to live a life
[40:39] a holy life. Amen. Because God is holy
[40:42] we need to be holy. Amen. So there is a
[40:45] gathering of the Pentecost of the
[40:47] restorations of the gift. Amen. But now
[40:49] in this last day, it is the the person
[40:51] of Jesus Christ in our midst. Amen. So
[40:55] that's why uh I I enjoy the the the the
[40:59] the message of brother Stephen Coffee
[41:02] while I'm
[41:04] streaming. What is the message of the
[41:06] hour to you?
[41:09] Amen. So it's not about only
[41:10] justification, sanctification, live a
[41:12] holy life, a restoration of the gift.
[41:14] What is the message of the hour? Because
[41:17] in times of Luther, when they ask
[41:18] Luther, what is the message of the hour?
[41:20] Luther can say immediately, oh that just
[41:23] shall live by faith.
[41:26] You need to work your way into
[41:28] salvation. You just need to believe. And
[41:30] that is the message of the hour and
[41:31] times of Luther. Then Wesley came and
[41:35] the they they add another more. Right.
[41:38] Not only you you believe but you need to
[41:42] have a holy life. You need to be
[41:44] sanctified.
[41:46] Amen. So that is the message of reality.
[41:48] Then the Pentecostal
[41:50] came and they believe that God need to
[41:53] restore the gift in the church.
[41:56] But they denominated and become right
[42:01] put a period in the gift
[42:04] and they put speaking in tongue as their
[42:07] evidence. But in these last days all of
[42:10] that are okay but we need not the gift
[42:13] but we need the person or the giver of
[42:16] the gift himself. Amen. We enjoy the
[42:20] gift of course but we need to enjoy the
[42:22] giver when we know who the giver of the
[42:24] gift is. And I believe when they said
[42:27] what is the message of the hour? The
[42:29] message of the hour is Jesus Christ the
[42:31] hope of glory in you. Amen. Amen.
[42:33] Hallelujah. Because we are the
[42:35] manifestations of the Jesus Christ which
[42:37] is the word of God. We cannot manifest
[42:40] Pentecostal. We cannot manifest Lutheran
[42:42] or Baptist or we are manifesting the
[42:45] word of God in this last day which is
[42:47] Jesus Christ.
[42:50] Amen.
[42:52] At the last trump, so for the trumpet
[42:55] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[42:57] incorruptible and we shall all be
[43:00] changed. Notice that it repeated the
[43:03] second
[43:04] time. We shall be changed. Not replaced,
[43:10] but changed. Like would you like to
[43:13] change a garment? Amen. We shall be
[43:16] changed. Amen. not replace.
[43:20] Right? And he said that incorruption and
[43:23] immortality is something that you put on
[43:25] like putting on a new garment. So this
[43:28] is the promise that we are looking
[43:30] forward to in these last days. So change
[43:33] is something that is not new to us.
[43:36] Every day we change. We change clothes.
[43:39] We change food. We change car. Sometimes
[43:41] we change career. So it's not really
[43:44] hard to comprehend a change.
[43:49] So life is full of change. So the
[43:52] concept of body change in this hour
[43:54] shouldn't be hard to comprehend
[43:56] especially when God promised it for this
[43:59] specific time. So it was not the brother
[44:01] Brandham who promised but it was God who
[44:04] promised a body change from
[44:07] incorruptible from corruptible into
[44:09] incorruptible. So there must be a
[44:12] promise in this last day. No, it is not
[44:14] the promise of a man but it is a promise
[44:16] of God. Amen. Hallelujah. As Job said in
[44:21] uh chapter
[44:22] 14 verse 14, Job said if a man die shall
[44:27] he live again that's a common questions
[44:30] among people
[44:31] shall and all the days of my appointed
[44:34] time will I wait till my change come. So
[44:38] everybody has an appointed time. That's
[44:40] right. So if God is not finished with
[44:43] you, no one can take your life because
[44:46] each and every one of us had an
[44:47] appointed time. So this appointed time
[44:50] you need to recognize our time in this
[44:53] earth. What is the purpose that we are
[44:55] here? So we need to enjoy our time here.
[44:59] We we are not here to just live by uh
[45:02] build houses, new cars. No, we have a
[45:06] purpose in these last days.
[45:08] As Paul said, I am waited
[45:14] for my appointed time. Amen.
[45:18] Till my chains come. Hallelujah. Amen.
[45:22] Amen.
[45:24] We have a body change.
[45:26] So we need to spend a lot of
[45:31] time worshiping and serving God in these
[45:34] last days. That's right. That is the
[45:35] very purpose that God sent Elijah to you
[45:38] to turn your heart back to the original
[45:39] faith because God need a witness in
[45:44] these last days.
[45:46] He need a
[45:47] people that we can always say there's a
[45:50] coworker in these last days.
[45:53] We will go to that later on.
[45:56] So remember the first thing that
[45:58] happened even in the book of Genesis
[46:00] after the fall of Adam and Eve was that
[46:02] their clothing changed from glorified
[46:05] garment because they were naked and they
[46:08] don't really know it because they were
[46:09] veiled
[46:11] with a holy veil or holy
[46:16] garment but when they fall it was
[46:18] changed to a lower they they they were a
[46:23] sheep proving him. Genesis
[46:28] 3:E 9. And the Lord called unto Adam and
[46:32] said unto him, "Where art thou?" And he
[46:33] said, "I heard thy voice in the garden,
[46:36] and I was afraid because I was naked,
[46:38] and I hid myself."
[46:44] So that's why a person cannot have
[46:49] confidence to face God when they are
[46:51] dressed incorrectly.
[46:54] You cannot petition of God if you
[46:58] dress incorrectly. Right? So these
[47:01] generations mostly of the people are
[47:03] naked
[47:06] but they keep on praising God and
[47:08] jumping God even in in in the so-called
[47:12] churches and they they say that they are
[47:14] worshiping
[47:15] God but we don't know whose God they
[47:18] worshiping in. That's right. Because our
[47:21] God is a holy God. So you cannot worship
[47:24] God with your shorts and pants
[47:27] and Amen. So there are true worshippers
[47:30] in these last days. Those who have a
[47:33] true revelation of God. Amen. Because
[47:35] you cannot worship
[47:37] God or approach God when you
[47:41] are
[47:44] improperly dressed. You need to have a
[47:47] holy dress. Amen. So that's why our
[47:50] dress that's why I preached a few months
[47:52] ago about the dress code. So we need to
[47:55] have a dress code to approach God.
[48:00] Just
[48:01] like Abel when he approached God by
[48:06] revelation, God accepted his sacrifice
[48:10] because he offered it by
[48:14] revelation. And the scripture said that
[48:16] he offered a more excellent sacrifice
[48:19] than that of Cain. Caen or Cain
[48:24] sacrifice was
[48:26] excellent but it was not the revelation
[48:28] of God. Right? So God didn't accept it.
[48:31] Likewise there are really true
[48:33] worshipper in these last days. And when
[48:35] we worship God, we petition God. God
[48:38] will listen because we offer him. We
[48:41] approach him according to the revelation
[48:45] that he has given us. Approach him with
[48:48] holiness. Amen. Amen.
[48:52] So remember that there are three robes
[48:55] that we must put on. And the first robe
[48:59] that we are to put on is what determines
[49:02] whether we go on to put on the other two
[49:05] robes.
[49:08] The first robe was the garment of the
[49:11] word of
[49:12] God. The first robe which must be put on
[49:15] is the garment of the
[49:17] word for our age and we must wear it
[49:22] upon our soul of faith. In other words,
[49:25] we are to be dressed by the hearing of
[49:27] the word that was sent in our day. Just
[49:30] like in Revelation 3:18, I counseledled
[49:33] thee to buy me of gold tried in fire
[49:35] that thou mayest be rich and white
[49:38] raignment that thou mayest be cloth and
[49:42] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[49:44] appear and anoint with that thou mayest
[49:48] see. So the first robe that we must put
[49:50] on is the revarment of the word that was
[49:53] sent in our day. Amen. We must put on
[49:56] the revealed word of the hour. Even the
[49:59] prophet said in the message the present
[50:00] stage of my ministry he said I hope
[50:02] he'll crown my ministry with this of
[50:05] letting me take the cloth of the word
[50:08] and dress his bride in the clothes of
[50:10] the word and for his righteousness. So
[50:13] the first robe was the word the revealed
[50:16] word that was given in our day. So the
[50:19] second robe is your theopony body
[50:23] and the third robe is your glorified
[50:25] body. And all of these are
[50:28] uh explained by our
[50:31] prophet. And there was a question in
[50:33] Paul in the Philippians. Who shall
[50:35] change our vile body? So vile body is
[50:39] low estate kind of body. Who will change
[50:41] it?
[50:44] that it may be fashioned like unto his
[50:47] glorious
[50:48] body according to the working whereby he
[50:51] is able even to subdue all things unto
[50:54] himselves. So our low-level quality of
[50:57] bodies are just outer garment that we
[51:00] wear that reflect our law level thinking
[51:04] of our reasoning against the word of
[51:06] God. Amen. Who can change this boiled
[51:09] body? So the prophet in the message who
[51:12] is this
[51:13] mech said when a man is born again from
[51:17] heaven he becomes a spirit baba in
[51:23] Christ. When a man is born again from
[51:29] heaven. So when we are born again we are
[51:32] not a creator of this earth anymore.
[51:36] Right. Christ, we become spiritual baba
[51:39] in Christ.
[51:42] So that's why sometimes we wonder when I
[51:45] become a Christian, why there's so many
[51:47] trials and testing comes my way?
[51:51] Just like the the the the
[51:55] Exodus when they come out from Egypt and
[51:58] they have been in wilderness, they
[52:00] always reflect, why did you do this to
[52:02] me to us? Well, something it's better
[52:04] for us to return to Egypt. So sometimes
[52:07] you wonder when I become a Christian why
[52:09] there's so many trials and testing.
[52:12] Remember the scripture you are born
[52:14] again from heaven. You become spiritual
[52:17] babe in Christ. And when you are bab you
[52:20] need to grow. Amen. When a baby grow
[52:23] sometime he fall he fail.
[52:26] But remember he was already born again.
[52:29] But you need to process of growing
[52:31] through the trials and testings on our
[52:33] life. So trial and testing is not just
[52:36] an ordinary thing or just supernatural.
[52:39] It is a natural thing for a Christian to
[52:42] have trials and testing because we
[52:44] become a spiritual babe when we are born
[52:47] again. And then when this robe of bless
[52:50] is dropped. So speaking about when the
[52:52] time that you are dead after you're
[52:55] growing and when this row of bless there
[52:58] is a natural body at the a body not made
[53:01] with hands neither born of a woman that
[53:03] we go to. So there is a body prepared.
[53:06] When this body is dropped there is a
[53:08] body being prepared. Not made with hand
[53:11] neither born of a woman that we go to.
[53:14] Then that body returns back and pick up
[53:16] the glorified body. That's the reason
[53:19] Jesus went to hell when he died and
[53:21] preached to the soul that were in prison
[53:23] turn back into theophony. Oh, marvelous.
[53:26] And the prophet said, "Oh, thank you."
[53:29] So he called 2 Corinthians 5:1, "If this
[53:33] earthly body be dissolved,
[53:37] this earthly tabernacle, we have another
[53:40] one." Amen.
[53:42] See, we have bypassed that to come
[53:44] straight from God the attribute to be
[53:47] flesh to be tempted and tested by sin
[53:50] like Adam
[53:52] did. We bypass our theopony body from
[53:58] straight from God from his attribute. We
[54:00] bypass our theopony straight to the body
[54:03] in order to be tempted and sin
[54:07] from attributes. So we are already
[54:09] attributes of God. Amen.
[54:12] That's right. This message is only for
[54:15] those part of his attribute. This is
[54:19] message is
[54:21] directly sent to you.
[54:24] Thank you Lord. So you are from the talk
[54:27] of God. You are the attributes of God.
[54:30] So you bypass your job which already
[54:32] being prepared. you bypass it and come
[54:36] into directly to this flesh
[54:39] in order to be tested and tempted. So
[54:44] this testing is not to let you down,
[54:47] to let you get away from Christ, but
[54:50] testing is to prove or let you manifest
[54:54] that attribute which was in the mind of
[54:57] God will be tested and tempted here to
[55:00] reveal
[55:02] the attributes of God in these last
[55:04] days. So that's why you are tested, you
[55:06] are tempted while you are being tested
[55:08] and tempted, the word of God which is in
[55:11] you become more manifest.
[55:13] because it's no longer you. It is the
[55:15] attribute of God in you being made
[55:18] manifest. So that's why you bypass your
[55:20] theony to be tempted. Hallelujah. So
[55:23] that's why God has so much confident in
[55:26] it is each and every one of us because
[55:27] we come from his mind and his s from his
[55:30] attribute
[55:31] by passing made in flesh. That's why we
[55:35] come is not an accident. That's right.
[55:38] We come here with a purpose.
[55:40] Amen.
[55:41] Hallelujah.
[55:43] So we bypass that to come straight from
[55:45] God. The attribute to be blessed to be
[55:47] tempted and tested by sin like Adam did.
[55:51] But when the testing of his word is
[55:54] over, then we are taken up to this body
[55:57] that was prepared for us before the
[55:59] foundation of the
[56:01] word. God is already showing us the
[56:04] blueprint.
[56:07] He sent us. You have testing after the
[56:10] testing is
[56:11] over. So whatever trial you are in,
[56:14] remember there is a beginning and
[56:15] there's always an end.
[56:18] There is no permanent testing. It is by
[56:21] the purpose of God. Amen. So when the
[56:23] testing is over, that's it. There
[56:28] is limitations for the testing. It has a
[56:31] beginning, it has an end. So when the
[56:34] testing is
[56:36] over either
[56:38] we goes into death or either we still
[56:42] alive and our body will be changed.
[56:45] Hallelujah. Whatever first we are
[56:49] still victorious. We are still ahead of
[56:53] Satan. Whether we die or we live, we can
[56:55] still be in the Lord. Amen.
[56:59] This body that was prepared for us
[57:01] before the foundation. It is the word
[57:05] that it is the word there that we skip
[57:08] to come right around down here to be
[57:11] tempted and tested. If we have come
[57:14] through that there had been no
[57:17] temptation and we know all things. If we
[57:20] didn't bypass our theony body, we will
[57:24] may know all things. No struggle, no
[57:26] everything. But the attributes of God
[57:29] will not be destroyed.
[57:31] We will know. We will never know about
[57:33] the grace and the mercies of God in our
[57:35] lives. We don't know how grace we don't
[57:39] know about healings. We don't know about
[57:41] salvation. We don't know about
[57:42] redemption. But all of us, we bypass the
[57:44] or theopony body in order to be tested,
[57:47] in order for us
[57:51] to praise him for what he has done.
[57:54] Amen. What he is doing and continue to
[57:59] do. Lord we have come through that there
[58:03] have been no temptation with know all
[58:05] things that the reason Jesus know all
[58:07] thing cuz he was word before he was
[58:09] flesh. That's right.
[58:12] Then we become the
[58:14] word. Here we are formed to the word
[58:17] image to be partakers of the word. Feed
[58:19] on the
[58:21] word. We become the word. Here we are
[58:24] formed to the word
[58:27] image. We are formed into our theopony
[58:30] word
[58:31] image. Feed on the word by being
[58:34] predestinated since the
[58:36] beginning. You see the little spark of
[58:39] life that you had in you from the
[58:41] beginning when you started your journey.
[58:43] Many of you can remember it. I believe
[58:47] each and every one of us has different
[58:49] experience when it comes to the Lord
[58:51] Jesus Christ. But one thing is sure, you
[58:54] are longing for something in your heart.
[58:55] Just like the prophet said, when you are
[58:57] still a little baby, that seed of God
[58:59] was already in you. That's why as you
[59:02] grow older, you're longer for something.
[59:04] You're bubbling. There's something in
[59:05] you looking for something. Then as the
[59:08] prophet then you jump from one church to
[59:11] another finding hallelujah something to
[59:14] satisfy that longing something that
[59:16] babbling something that kicking
[59:18] it was the predestinated seed of God.
[59:22] Praise the Lord. Isn't every one of us
[59:24] different experiences? Y but we know
[59:28] it's all God.
[59:31] Now many of you can remember it. You
[59:33] joined this church and joined the church
[59:34] and tried this and right nothing
[59:36] satisfied. That's right. But one day you
[59:38] just recognize it. That's right. Amen.
[59:41] We just recognize that as brother Brham
[59:43] said, I was a son of Charles Anela, but
[59:47] they one day I realized that I am not a
[59:50] son of charla. Amen.
[59:54] Because the real you is the inside.
[59:56] Amen. So continue. Who is this Melazedc?
[1:00:00] And look
[1:00:02] clearly, make it clear. You will never
[1:00:05] be the word unless you was a thought at
[1:00:09] the beginning.
[1:00:12] That proves the predestinations of God.
[1:00:14] You will never be the word unless you
[1:00:17] are a thought of God at the
[1:00:22] beginning. While I'm reading this uh uh
[1:00:27] messages, it's become so personal.
[1:00:30] It seems like God is talking to me
[1:00:32] personally. Amen. It's not for the
[1:00:35] congregation. It's just for me
[1:00:36] personally. Amen. He is letting me know
[1:00:40] who I am
[1:00:42] and what part
[1:00:45] I am
[1:00:47] going to manifest in these last days
[1:00:51] because I personal sent to you Elijah.
[1:00:53] So this is so personal. When you read
[1:00:56] the spoken word make it your personal.
[1:00:58] Amen. The word is speaking to you
[1:01:00] personally. It's not for everybody else.
[1:01:02] Don't give it to somebody else. Grab it.
[1:01:06] That's for you. That's me, mama.
[1:01:12] That proves that for the destination of
[1:01:14] God. See, you can't be the word unless
[1:01:16] you are a thought.
[1:01:19] You are a thought of God. He He thought
[1:01:23] about you.
[1:01:25] Even in your trials, in your testing,
[1:01:27] whatever situations your life, he
[1:01:29] thought about you.
[1:01:31] He's thinking about you. Amen. Because
[1:01:34] he loves you. Amen. Yep. Just like the
[1:01:38] song said, when he was in the cross,
[1:01:40] he's thinking about me. Oh, thank you.
[1:01:43] When he was in the cross, he's looking
[1:01:44] down.
[1:01:46] He's looking down for you and I. Praise
[1:01:49] the Lord. Because Paul said that without
[1:01:52] his crucifixion, there will be no
[1:01:54] resurrection. Right?
[1:01:57] You had to be in his thinking first. But
[1:01:59] you see in order to stand temptation you
[1:02:01] had to bypass the theopony. You had to
[1:02:04] come down here and flesh to be tempted
[1:02:06] by sin and then if you and then if you
[1:02:09] sin all the father has given me will
[1:02:11] come to me and I'll raise him up at the
[1:02:13] last day. So you had to be first and
[1:02:16] then you see he come right bound to the
[1:02:18] regular line from
[1:02:21] attributes as the prophet said but if
[1:02:23] you are alive on earth at the time of
[1:02:25] the rapture then that theopony is coming
[1:02:27] to us now by the way of the word
[1:02:33] that is why we know that we have the
[1:02:35] ability to respond to the word for our
[1:02:38] days
[1:02:42] then that proves that we have a theopony
[1:02:44] body waiting for us on the other side
[1:02:49] because only those with theopony body
[1:02:52] can hear the message for their day.
[1:02:54] Amen. That is really the influence that
[1:02:57] you have at theopony waiting for you.
[1:02:59] Amen. As the prophet said, then after
[1:03:02] you recognize the very word of God was
[1:03:04] eagle food, then you left the other
[1:03:07] thing you have been formed into the
[1:03:09] living image of the living God. You
[1:03:11] heard from your theophony. If this
[1:03:14] earthly body be dissolved, we have one
[1:03:16] waiting. You are responding to the word
[1:03:18] your company and that is the evidence
[1:03:21] that you came from the mind of God
[1:03:23] because you cannot respond hallelujah to
[1:03:26] this message of the hour unless you are
[1:03:28] part of this scripture.
[1:03:32] You cannot respond to a Baptist message.
[1:03:34] You cannot respond to Lutheran message.
[1:03:36] You cannot respond to any church. But
[1:03:38] you respond to the message of the hour
[1:03:40] wherein everybody's denying the message
[1:03:43] of the hour. Why did you respond to the
[1:03:45] message of the hour? Because you are a
[1:03:47] part. You heard from your company. The
[1:03:50] word body, hallelujah, is waiting for
[1:03:53] you.
[1:03:55] Hallelujah. So we'll read again the
[1:03:58] Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51. Behold,
[1:04:01] I show you a mystery. We shall all
[1:04:04] sleep, but we shall be changed. The we
[1:04:06] are the one whom the
[1:04:07] mystery for this age has been revealed
[1:04:10] to.
[1:04:13] This only for a special group of people.
[1:04:18] Amen.
[1:04:20] And to all of those who are the one who
[1:04:23] will put on incorruption because all who
[1:04:25] receive the message for their day in
[1:04:28] whatever age they are born in will also
[1:04:32] receive a new body. And so the scripture
[1:04:34] goes on to explain to us the process of
[1:04:37] how this vile body of ours will be
[1:04:41] changed in a
[1:04:43] moment in the twinkling of an eye at the
[1:04:46] last trump. And we know that the
[1:04:48] eye of the mind the faculty of knowing
[1:04:52] or in other words we need the
[1:04:55] revelations of the hour. Amen.
[1:04:59] So the first part of the mystery of the
[1:05:01] budget change is that we will receive a
[1:05:03] revelation in these last days at the
[1:05:06] time of the last trump.
[1:05:08] We will have a change of mind.
[1:05:11] Yes. That's the evidence. We have a
[1:05:14] change of mind. You become a new creator
[1:05:16] in Christ. Amen. You become your your
[1:05:19] mind change. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:23] A change of mind. A change of thinking
[1:05:25] from three God to one God. From the
[1:05:27] apple to the serpent seed. Amen. From
[1:05:30] baptism father, the son and the holy
[1:05:32] ghost to the baptism in the name of the
[1:05:33] lord Jesus Christ. We change our mind.
[1:05:37] We change our thinking. We realize the
[1:05:40] opening of this of the word in these
[1:05:42] last days. Thank you Lord. Amen. For the
[1:05:46] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[1:05:48] be raised up incorruptible and we shall
[1:05:51] all be changed.
[1:05:54] We shall all be changed.
[1:05:56] Notice that there are two changes
[1:06:00] mentioned verse 51 and again in verse 52
[1:06:03] because you cannot have a change on the
[1:06:07] outside until there is first a change on
[1:06:10] the inside. That's right. So you need to
[1:06:12] have a change.
[1:06:15] We shall all be changed. So the change
[1:06:17] begin on the inside not on the outside.
[1:06:20] We cannot do anything to help or mirrors
[1:06:23] our salvation because our salvation is
[1:06:25] already done deal even before the
[1:06:27] foundation of the word. You just need to
[1:06:30] recognize who you are and quicken that
[1:06:32] seed and that seed is quickened. It will
[1:06:35] manifest what's on the inside on the
[1:06:37] outside.
[1:06:40] We cannot add anything to merit our
[1:06:43] salvation. Amen. It's already done. That
[1:06:46] God that's why God requires only belief.
[1:06:49] Amen. Recognize your day and your
[1:06:51] message.
[1:06:53] Because if you are a seed, there is
[1:06:54] already an anointing released into our
[1:06:57] day. When the prophets was asked, take
[1:07:00] the pen and write it. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:03] Praise God. Glory. Genesis 1:11, let
[1:07:07] every seed bring forth of its kind.
[1:07:10] Amen. So the anointing was released. But
[1:07:13] whatsoever if you are a seed of God, the
[1:07:16] anointing will quicken that seed from
[1:07:19] the inside to the outside, not the
[1:07:22] outside to the inside. Even though how
[1:07:24] much you struggle to be good, how much
[1:07:26] you struggle to be holy, you cannot make
[1:07:28] it.
[1:07:30] It must begin on the inside.
[1:07:34] If you a seed of God, the seed, the Holy
[1:07:36] Spirit will quicken that seed and all
[1:07:39] the fruit will begin to manifest.
[1:07:42] Hallelujah. You don't struggle to have
[1:07:44] brotherly kindness. No, don't struggle
[1:07:46] for that. You don't struggle to have
[1:07:49] temperance. You don't struggle to have
[1:07:51] brotherly. No.
[1:07:53] Leave it unto God.
[1:07:57] Let lays in the presence of God. Let the
[1:08:00] Holy Spirit quicken it. Because we shall
[1:08:04] all be changed. That's done. That's
[1:08:07] finished. Whether we like it or not, it
[1:08:10] was already spoken. It was a prophecy
[1:08:12] that need to be manifest in this life.
[1:08:14] We shall all be changed.
[1:08:17] Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:08:20] We just need to have faith in that word
[1:08:23] of God. And I believe that God is
[1:08:25] fulfilling scripture every day in our
[1:08:27] lives. He is fulfilling whether we like
[1:08:29] it, whether we believe it or not. God is
[1:08:32] fulfilling scripture every day in our
[1:08:34] lives.
[1:08:35] [Music]
[1:08:37] Don't worry about shortcomings or trials
[1:08:42] because we bypass our theophony in order
[1:08:45] to be tested.
[1:08:48] Hallelujah.
[1:08:50] So expect trials and testing more and
[1:08:52] more. That's right. Because the more
[1:08:54] trial comes your way, the more manifest
[1:08:56] will come out. Amen. Because he then
[1:09:00] sent trials
[1:09:03] knowing that we cannot make it. He sent
[1:09:05] trials in order for his seed to
[1:09:08] manifest. It is all his doing. That's
[1:09:11] right. We have nothing to do with it. We
[1:09:14] cannot add anything to what he has
[1:09:16] already done. We just need to believe
[1:09:19] humble ourselves in the presence of God.
[1:09:21] That's right. And the more we humble
[1:09:22] ourselves, the more we the more we we we
[1:09:25] we commit ourselves unto the Lord, he
[1:09:28] just reveal himself more and more. Thank
[1:09:30] you. That's why he preached the message,
[1:09:32] lean not unto thy own understanding.
[1:09:35] Lean not on thy own fury. Lean not on
[1:09:38] thy own
[1:09:39] interpretation, but in all thy ways
[1:09:43] acknowledge him, and he will direct your
[1:09:45] path. He will give you the revelations
[1:09:48] of the hour. Lean not unto thy own
[1:09:50] understanding, but in all your ways
[1:09:53] acknowledge that he will be the one to
[1:09:55] do it all. That's why he say seek you
[1:09:57] first the kingdom of God. Hallelujah.
[1:10:01] Hallelujah.
[1:10:06] So, so the first chain must take place
[1:10:08] on the inside first by the change of
[1:10:10] mind which come by the revelations of
[1:10:12] the word. Then that is the evidence that
[1:10:15] a change is also coming to the outside
[1:10:18] of the body from mortal to immortality.
[1:10:21] Right? Verse 53. For this corruptible
[1:10:24] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[1:10:27] must put on immortality. So the putting
[1:10:31] on of the new body on the
[1:10:33] outside is the result of putting on the
[1:10:37] mind of Christ on the inside. Amen.
[1:10:41] And that is why the first garment must
[1:10:43] be put on the soul first. And the soul
[1:10:45] is what you believe.
[1:10:48] There is no reasoning in your soul.
[1:10:52] Only believe. Because if you are a
[1:10:54] believer, you have no choice. You have
[1:10:57] no option but to believe the word.
[1:11:01] Amen.
[1:11:03] Sometimes you doubt, but you still
[1:11:04] believe. That's right. Sometimes you're
[1:11:07] discouraged, but you still believe.
[1:11:08] Amen. Yeah. Sometimes you cannot explain
[1:11:10] it but you just believe. Because you
[1:11:13] have no option. You are born to be a
[1:11:16] believer. Hallelujah.
[1:11:18] And that is the secret to the body
[1:11:20] change that is ours. To put on a new
[1:11:22] garment on the outside. You must first
[1:11:25] put on the word on the inside.
[1:11:29] Do you have the word in your life now?
[1:11:31] Amen. You can never be you you will
[1:11:34] never be here this morning without the
[1:11:36] word of God in you. That's right. And I
[1:11:38] always believe that every gathering is a
[1:11:40] supernatural gathering. We are a
[1:11:43] premoral agency as a person. We can
[1:11:46] choose to play pickle ball this morning.
[1:11:49] We can choose to go to the beach. We can
[1:11:51] go anywhere we want because we are a
[1:11:53] premorality. But why you choose here?
[1:11:55] Because it was not you. It was God in
[1:11:57] you. Because no one can come to the
[1:12:00] father except he draws him near. It was
[1:12:03] the grace of God, the supernatural power
[1:12:05] of God that draws us near this morning.
[1:12:08] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:11] Through the scriptures in 1
[1:12:13] Thessalonians 4:15,
[1:12:17] this is our favorite scripture.
[1:12:20] For this we say unto you by the word of
[1:12:23] the
[1:12:24] Lord, that we which are alive and remain
[1:12:28] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:12:30] prevent them which are
[1:12:33] asleep. For the Lord himself shall
[1:12:35] descend from heaven with a shout and
[1:12:37] with a voice of the archangel and with
[1:12:40] the trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:12:42] shall burst first. So all these
[1:12:45] scriptures pertaining to this specific
[1:12:48] time that we are living in now because
[1:12:51] we are living in the season of when the
[1:12:54] last trump is about to sound.
[1:12:57] We have already heard a shout. We have
[1:12:59] already heard a voice. We are waiting
[1:13:01] for the last trump.
[1:13:04] And the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:13:06] And we who are on earth with the
[1:13:08] revelation of the word in us will also
[1:13:10] get out of our body change.
[1:13:14] How do we know these things are upon
[1:13:18] us? That's a good question, right? Amen.
[1:13:22] Because we have already had a shout
[1:13:25] which was the message of the hour was
[1:13:27] declared through an end time
[1:13:31] prophet. We have a sure word of promise
[1:13:34] in these last days. Thank you Lord.
[1:13:37] But we have moved on from that pace. So
[1:13:40] right now as the body of Christ, we are
[1:13:42] in the voice
[1:13:45] stage of the voice shout and the trump
[1:13:48] the three-part process. So we are now in
[1:13:51] the voice stage right now.
[1:13:54] Then that just leave the trump which is
[1:13:56] the changing of our natural bodies and
[1:13:58] the catching away to the marriage
[1:13:59] supper. Remember that when he descended
[1:14:02] he did these three things.
[1:14:07] He didn't wait for another decade.
[1:14:10] He he he descended there were a shout.
[1:14:13] Then he he didn't wait for another
[1:14:16] decade. Amen. To manifest the voice.
[1:14:18] When he descended, he did these three
[1:14:21] things. Amen. The shout, the voice, and
[1:14:23] the trump. Yeah.
[1:14:25] So, three things happen. A boy shout uh
[1:14:28] the message, the rapture, paragraph 130.
[1:14:30] Three things happen. A boy, a shout, a
[1:14:33] trumpet has to happen before Jesus
[1:14:35] appears. Yes, sir. So he's speaking
[1:14:37] about the appearing in his corporal
[1:14:40] body. So before he appear in his
[1:14:43] corporal body, he need to to to do three
[1:14:46] things. Now a shout Jesus does all these
[1:14:49] three. When he is descending, he did all
[1:14:51] these things. When he's descending a
[1:14:54] shout, what is a shout? Is the message
[1:14:55] going forth first? The living bread of
[1:14:58] living life, bringing forth the bride.
[1:15:01] Amen. So this is the only message that
[1:15:04] can quicken the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:07] No other message the shout is quickened
[1:15:10] the bride in these last days because is
[1:15:14] is bringing the living bread of life
[1:15:16] bringing forth the bride. Notice that
[1:15:18] this is the message that has brought
[1:15:20] forth the bride. If it wasn't for the
[1:15:22] message coming to us you and I would not
[1:15:24] believe the things that we believe
[1:15:25] today. That's right. Do you agree? Amen.
[1:15:30] We are here today because this message
[1:15:34] has brought us forth. Thank you Lord. So
[1:15:39] this is not an accident. We can see that
[1:15:42] predestination is in plain view. You
[1:15:45] cannot accept
[1:15:48] it. If you are not part of God
[1:15:52] then the voice is that same message now
[1:15:55] in the hearts of the people. Yes sir.
[1:15:57] And so they have become the voice. Amen.
[1:16:00] The shout the voice that voice is now in
[1:16:04] the bride.
[1:16:06] The messenger declared the shout part
[1:16:08] but the bride declared the voice part
[1:16:11] because now that shout is in her and has
[1:16:15] become her voice. Amen. As the prophet
[1:16:18] said, in the last days, there is again
[1:16:21] another people
[1:16:23] in the land who under the messenger will
[1:16:26] be the final voice to the final age.
[1:16:29] Amen. The shout was brought by the
[1:16:31] prophet, but the voice is in the bride
[1:16:33] now. Because we are the final voice to
[1:16:36] the final age.
[1:16:38] Yes, sir. The church is no longer his
[1:16:42] mouthpiece of God. The church is no
[1:16:44] longer the mouthpiece of God. It is his
[1:16:47] own mouthpiece.
[1:16:49] Hallelujah. Amen. The church is no
[1:16:51] longer the mouthpiece, but it is his
[1:16:53] mouthpiece. You see, so it's his own
[1:16:55] mouthpiece. I am the mouthpiece of God
[1:16:58] in this. You are the mouthpiece of God.
[1:17:00] You are the voice of God in these last
[1:17:02] days. Hallelujah. The word is in the
[1:17:05] bride. That's why when the book of
[1:17:07] redemption was given to John, he said,
[1:17:09] "Take the book now and hear it.
[1:17:14] Hallelujah. The voice, the book is no
[1:17:17] longer in the throne.
[1:17:21] The book is no longer in the hand of the
[1:17:23] angel. Amen. The book now is in John.
[1:17:27] Take the book and eat it.
[1:17:30] Hallelujah. You can no longer see or
[1:17:33] find the book because it was already
[1:17:35] given to John and he ate it. Hallelujah.
[1:17:40] Amen. So that's why we are part of the
[1:17:43] program of God. Hallelujah. It was God
[1:17:46] in Christ. Now God in many membered body
[1:17:49] the book is in the bride. This is John.
[1:17:52] I know he was commanded. Thou must
[1:17:54] prophesy again. John the voice is in the
[1:17:58] bride in this last day. You cannot find
[1:18:00] any message now but it's in the bride.
[1:18:04] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:18:07] So God is turning on her.
[1:18:12] God is turning on you.
[1:18:15] He is depending upon you.
[1:18:18] So you need to recognize who you are.
[1:18:20] Amen. Don't look at your shortcoming.
[1:18:23] Don't look at yourself, but look at what
[1:18:25] the promise of God that was given in
[1:18:27] your generation.
[1:18:29] Just like Gideon who is always looking
[1:18:31] at his shortcomings. When the angel
[1:18:33] appeared to him, I will call you to
[1:18:35] deliver your people. And he looked upon
[1:18:37] him said,
[1:18:40] "I cannot do it. I am poorest of the
[1:18:42] poor." But the angel said, "Thou art a
[1:18:45] man of valor." Amen. Likewise, in these
[1:18:47] last days, as the prophet said, God is
[1:18:50] turning on her.
[1:18:53] He will confound her to the prophet and
[1:18:55] the bride, for the voice of God will be
[1:18:58] in her.
[1:19:00] Revelation chapter 7. And yes, it is.
[1:19:02] For it says in the last chapter of
[1:19:04] Revelation 17, the spirit and the bread
[1:19:07] say come. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:19:12] We will be preaching the same message as
[1:19:15] the prophets say. Because the message of
[1:19:18] the prophet is not his message. It is
[1:19:21] the message of the mighty God coming
[1:19:23] down. Hallelujah. It is the seven
[1:19:26] thunder being opened and was given to
[1:19:28] the seven church ages. And it is the
[1:19:31] seventh angel of revelation chapter 7.
[1:19:35] Hallelujah. That solid the message. And
[1:19:38] that message we receive it. And we are
[1:19:41] now commanded to preach or prophesy
[1:19:43] again. The same message that he
[1:19:45] preached. The same revelation he got is
[1:19:48] the same revelation that we are
[1:19:49] preaching now. Amen.
[1:19:51] Thank you Lord.
[1:19:53] Thou must prophesy again.
[1:19:56] Hallelujah. So the shout has changed
[1:19:58] from being in the form of message from
[1:20:01] God through a prophet and that message
[1:20:05] was then written in ink and paper and
[1:20:08] put into a spoken word books.
[1:20:11] But now that same word that was written
[1:20:13] in the spoken word book is now written
[1:20:16] in the heart of the elect of God by
[1:20:19] revelation. That is why it is the voice
[1:20:22] of the resurrection in the bride now.
[1:20:24] Amen. Because when the word comes into
[1:20:27] us,
[1:20:28] it
[1:20:30] automatically resurrect us from dark
[1:20:32] denominational tomb into the glorious
[1:20:35] light of this end time age. Amen.
[1:20:37] Because it shall be light at the evening
[1:20:40] time. But where is the light? It is in
[1:20:43] the heart of every true message believer
[1:20:45] in the last days. The light is the word
[1:20:47] which is where? It is in the heart of
[1:20:49] every believer.
[1:20:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we can see
[1:20:55] that from shout to voice. It's simply
[1:20:57] that the word was just changed from one
[1:20:59] glory to a greater glory.
[1:21:02] Hallelujah. We are enjoying
[1:21:05] that we are living in the golden age
[1:21:08] where God is unfolding what was in his
[1:21:10] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:21:12] and we are part of the message of the
[1:21:14] hour. That's why we rejoice because we
[1:21:18] are hearing from our
[1:21:20] hallelujah. One of these days we're
[1:21:21] going back, hallelujah, to the mind and
[1:21:24] the thought of God. Because we know as
[1:21:26] we are responding to the word. Amen.
[1:21:29] Woo. You cannot respond unless you are
[1:21:31] part of God in this land. Amen. You are
[1:21:34] aiming not to me, but you're aiming to
[1:21:36] the word. Hallelujah. You're
[1:21:40] in these last days. Amen. So, we can see
[1:21:42] that from shell to voice. It's simply
[1:21:44] that the word was just changed from
[1:21:45] glory to glory. From printed word on a
[1:21:49] page to a living word.
[1:21:52] Revelation in the heart of the chosen
[1:21:54] people.
[1:21:56] The church of the firstborn
[1:21:59] born in the original seed. The spoken
[1:22:02] word seed of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:22:05] Amen.
[1:22:07] In the rapture now is the first thing is
[1:22:09] the
[1:22:10] sounding. This is in paragraph 152.
[1:22:14] The first thing is a trumpet or a voice
[1:22:17] shout then a voice and a trumpet shout a
[1:22:20] messenger getting the people ready. Then
[1:22:23] the second is a voice of resurrection.
[1:22:25] The same voice that a loud voice is St.
[1:22:27] John 11 38:44. So we will go that a
[1:22:31] little
[1:22:32] while. So brother Bernham is quoting
[1:22:35] John chapter 11. Yes sir. We will go
[1:22:38] that a little. getting the bride
[1:22:40] together and then the resurrection of
[1:22:42] the dead sea to be caught up with it.
[1:22:44] Now watch the three things takes place.
[1:22:46] The next is what? A trumpet, a shout, a
[1:22:49] voice of a trumpet, a three-part secret
[1:22:52] body change in this hour. It's written
[1:22:55] in mystery form throughout the entire
[1:22:58] Bible. Amen. But it took the opening of
[1:23:01] the seventh seal to show this thing.
[1:23:04] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. We cannot
[1:23:07] rejoice unless the
[1:23:08] word is being opened in our day. It is a
[1:23:12] sealed book, mystery book. Just like in
[1:23:15] second Corinthians chapter
[1:23:17] 3:14, they said that the seventh seal is
[1:23:19] not open yet. And this is what Paul said
[1:23:23] to the Corinthians, but their minds were
[1:23:25] blinded. Blinded.
[1:23:27] Yes. For until this day remainth the
[1:23:30] same veil untaken away in the reading of
[1:23:33] the Old Testament, we shall be veiled
[1:23:34] done away in Christ. Amen. Psalm says
[1:23:37] that the spoken word the seven seat is
[1:23:40] not open yet. They're waiting for
[1:23:41] brother Bernham to come.
[1:23:44] The veil is done away in Christ.
[1:23:46] Remember that Christ is coming already
[1:23:49] open the seal.
[1:23:51] So we are promised a tripfold transition
[1:23:54] in this hour from glory of the event of
[1:23:56] the shout to the message to a greater
[1:23:58] glory of the revelations of the message
[1:24:01] in the heart of the believer. Amen. And
[1:24:04] then go on to an even greater unfolding
[1:24:07] of the glory in the new body from glory
[1:24:09] to glory. He's changing me. Thank you.
[1:24:13] Start from the inside going to the
[1:24:15] outside.
[1:24:17] Amen. Amen.
[1:24:19] Verse 15. But even unto this day, when
[1:24:24] Moses is read, when the prophet is read,
[1:24:27] the veil is upon their head or upon
[1:24:29] their heart.
[1:24:31] Nevertheless, it shall turn to the Lord,
[1:24:34] the veil shall be taken away. They need
[1:24:37] revelation. They need to go deeper into
[1:24:39] the love of God. They need to seek the
[1:24:42] Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. Nevertheless,
[1:24:46] when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil
[1:24:47] shall be taken away. Now the Lord is a
[1:24:49] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:24:51] is there is liberty. So we have liberty
[1:24:55] this morning. Amen.
[1:24:57] Nobody's controlling us. No nicolitan
[1:24:59] spirit. No bmnition spirit when the
[1:25:02] spirit of the lord is. We have liberty.
[1:25:04] That's why we can stand, we can shout,
[1:25:06] we can dance whatever we like because we
[1:25:08] have the spirit of God in us. Don't be
[1:25:11] ashamed. Amen. Of your identification.
[1:25:15] Hallelujah. When you say amen, just say
[1:25:17] amen. Hallelujah. Don't be ashamed of
[1:25:20] what what somebody else beside you will
[1:25:22] say. No, it is an individual affair.
[1:25:26] It is an individual affair. If God wants
[1:25:28] you to stand, stand. If God wants you to
[1:25:30] run, run. Yes. We have the liberty in
[1:25:33] these last days.
[1:25:35] Amen.
[1:25:37] But we all with open page beholding us
[1:25:40] in a glass
[1:25:43] a mirror of the word that mirrors your
[1:25:45] life in the Bible from Genesis to
[1:25:47] Revelation.
[1:25:49] Just like what what brother Moses saying
[1:25:52] when he's looking at the mirror.
[1:25:54] Hallelujah. He said that's me, mama.
[1:25:57] That's me, mama. From Genesis to
[1:25:59] Revelation. That's me, mama. Hallelujah.
[1:26:01] That's me from Easter mama. That's me
[1:26:02] from Ruth. Mama. That's from Abigail. I
[1:26:05] am I am reflecting all those characters
[1:26:09] in the Bible because they are the
[1:26:11] mystery written in the volumes of the
[1:26:14] book. They are speaking about me about
[1:26:16] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] Thank you Lord. Who shall change our
[1:26:23] vile body
[1:26:25] that it may be passion like unto his
[1:26:28] glorious body. So who is this mech? He
[1:26:31] said, "If this earthly tabernacle be
[1:26:34] dissolved, we have one already waiting."
[1:26:37] Amen. Already waiting. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:26:43] We are on the winning side.
[1:26:47] Either we can make it here or we are
[1:26:49] still alive when that blast. We are
[1:26:52] still on the winning side. Because there
[1:26:54] is a body waiting. Thank you, Lord. We
[1:26:57] have not yet the bodies. But look, when
[1:27:00] this body receive the spirit of God,
[1:27:03] listen to this, the immortal life inside
[1:27:06] of you, the spirit is immortal life in
[1:27:09] you, which is the life of Christ. It
[1:27:11] throws this body in subjection to God.
[1:27:15] Hallelujah. So that's why you know when
[1:27:18] you receive the word spirit, the spirit
[1:27:20] of God in you, it will quicken this
[1:27:23] mortal body subjection to the word of
[1:27:26] God.
[1:27:28] He that's born of God that not commit
[1:27:31] sin. Amen. Hallelujah. That's why there
[1:27:34] will be they they ask well if I am born
[1:27:37] again I'm son of God can I do anything I
[1:27:39] want? The prophet said yes you can do
[1:27:41] anything you want but I guarantee you
[1:27:43] will you never desire to commit sin
[1:27:47] because he that's born of God not commit
[1:27:51] sin.
[1:27:52] He cannot sin because sin is unbelief to
[1:27:56] the word of God.
[1:27:58] Romans 8:1, there is therefore now, if
[1:28:02] you receive the spirit of God, there is
[1:28:04] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:28:07] that are in Christ. Are you in Christ
[1:28:10] this morning? So there is now no more
[1:28:13] condemnation.
[1:28:15] Hallelujah. If you're in Christ, there's
[1:28:16] no more condemnation because you receive
[1:28:18] the salvation of God. You recognize who
[1:28:20] you are. You recognize your day and your
[1:28:22] message. That's right.
[1:28:25] Glory. Let the message in you
[1:28:29] do the manifestations of his fruit.
[1:28:32] Don't struggle.
[1:28:35] Because the more you struggle,
[1:28:38] the more you will be discouraged because
[1:28:41] you cannot do it by your own self.
[1:28:43] That's right. You just need to recognize
[1:28:46] that the anointing was released to
[1:28:48] quicken that seed in you. He that's born
[1:28:50] of God and not commit sin, he cannot
[1:28:52] sin. Therefore, there's no now no
[1:28:55] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:28:57] Jesus. They walk not after the flesh,
[1:28:59] but after the spirit.
[1:29:02] There you are. That throws your body
[1:29:05] subject.
[1:29:07] You don't have to say, "Oh, if I could
[1:29:09] just quit drinking, if I could just get
[1:29:11] in Christ, it's all gone." When you are
[1:29:14] in Christ,
[1:29:16] because your body is subject to the
[1:29:18] spirit. It's no more subject to the
[1:29:21] things of the word. They're dead. They
[1:29:24] are dead. And your sins are buried in
[1:29:26] baptism. And you are now a new creation
[1:29:28] in Christ. Your body becoming subject to
[1:29:31] the spirit. Try to live a right kind of
[1:29:34] life. Amen. Like your women claiming you
[1:29:38] get the Holy Ghost and going out here
[1:29:40] and wearing short and things. How could
[1:29:42] you do it? If you repressed to be a
[1:29:45] Christian and you're stealing wearing
[1:29:47] short tight kneedeed or whatsoever I'm
[1:29:51] not good at that I will leave it to
[1:29:53] brother Martin and going out here and
[1:29:56] wearing shorts and think how could you
[1:29:58] do it? How could the spirit of God in
[1:30:00] you ever let you do such a thing as
[1:30:02] that? That's a good question. It just
[1:30:05] can't be. So
[1:30:08] certainly it can't be. He's not a pilot
[1:30:12] spirit. He is a holy spirit.
[1:30:15] And then when you become subject to that
[1:30:18] spirit, it throws your whole being
[1:30:21] subject to that spirit.
[1:30:23] And that spirit is nothing in the word
[1:30:26] but deceived. Word made manifest or
[1:30:29] quickened. Hallelujah.
[1:30:31] Made alive. And when the Bible said
[1:30:33] don't do this, that body quickly turns
[1:30:36] to it. There is no question about it.
[1:30:39] That's right. You follow what the
[1:30:40] scripture said.
[1:30:43] When the scripture is not good for a
[1:30:44] woman to wear a garment pertains to a
[1:30:47] man, your body is subject to follow the
[1:30:50] word. You cannot help it if the spirit
[1:30:52] of God who inspired the writer to write
[1:30:55] the Bible is in you.
[1:30:58] You will manifest what it says. your
[1:31:01] body will follow. You cannot go outside
[1:31:05] of what is being written. Amen.
[1:31:08] And when the Bible said don't do this,
[1:31:10] that body quickly turns to it. There is
[1:31:12] no question. And what it is is the
[1:31:16] earnest of the resurrection.
[1:31:19] This body will raise up again because
[1:31:21] it's already started.
[1:31:24] Hallelujah. It started our resurrection
[1:31:26] because we heard a voice. We are the sh
[1:31:29] and we are now in the process
[1:31:32] of the resurrection
[1:31:34] because it's already started. It was
[1:31:36] once subject to sin and mire and
[1:31:39] corruption but now it's got the earnest
[1:31:44] it turns heavenly.
[1:31:46] Now the earnest that you're going in the
[1:31:49] rapture. Right? In other words, the
[1:31:52] proof that you're going in the rapture
[1:31:55] is that the change on the inside of you
[1:31:58] has already begun to show on the outside
[1:32:02] of you in the form of your conduct and
[1:32:04] your dress code. Hallelujah. The earness
[1:32:07] of the rapture is now beginning in your
[1:32:09] life. You have now the earness because
[1:32:12] your body is now subject to the word.
[1:32:17] Praise the Lord. We cannot run away from
[1:32:19] it. If you say there's a rapture,
[1:32:22] there's body change, we can say amen. We
[1:32:24] can rejoice about it. We may not explain
[1:32:26] how we do it. But we believe it because
[1:32:29] it's already written. That's right.
[1:32:35] Now, that's the earnest that you're
[1:32:36] going in the rapture. The prophet said
[1:32:39] that
[1:32:42] the proof that you're going in the
[1:32:43] rapture is that the change on the inside
[1:32:46] of you has already begun
[1:32:50] to show on the outside
[1:32:53] by the way you conduct yourself. Amen.
[1:32:58] I remember brother Lucas Lubiki. I am
[1:33:01] now a rapture candidate.
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:05] while he sing that song I am a rapture
[1:33:07] candidate
[1:33:09] and let us be ashamed about that because
[1:33:12] even believing the word we cannot help
[1:33:14] it we we we believe it.
[1:33:18] So in the last we will uh take what
[1:33:21] brother Bernham said in John chapter
[1:33:24] 11 verse
[1:33:28] 38. Are you enjoying so far?
[1:33:32] Amen. We need to enjoy because we are
[1:33:34] living in the golden age that we're
[1:33:37] living in. We may see exactly
[1:33:41] the prophecy in this last day. There
[1:33:43] will be a change. Yes, sir. We shall all
[1:33:46] be changed. Amen. So it was not given to
[1:33:50] unbelievers. It was given to the
[1:33:51] believers. We shall all be changed
[1:33:56] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye.
[1:33:58] Hallelujah. So we have now the earnest
[1:34:02] John
[1:34:06] 11:38. So if we if we look closely, we
[1:34:09] will also see the shout voice and the
[1:34:10] trump hidden in the story of the raising
[1:34:12] of
[1:34:14] Lazarus. Verse 38. Jesus therefore again
[1:34:17] groaning in himself cometh to the
[1:34:20] grave. It was a cave and a stone lay
[1:34:23] upon it. Notice the tomb was sealed.
[1:34:27] showing that before the resurrection can
[1:34:29] take place, there must be a seal
[1:34:36] broken. That before the res take place,
[1:34:39] there must be a seal broken. And that is
[1:34:41] why in the hour there could be no
[1:34:43] resurrection outside of dark
[1:34:45] denominational tomb until the seventh
[1:34:48] seal were open. Yes sir. There is no
[1:34:51] resurrection outside of the seventh seal
[1:34:54] being open.
[1:34:56] And Jesus said, "Take ye away the stone
[1:34:58] Mara, the sister of him that was dead,
[1:35:01] and said unto him, Lord, by this time he
[1:35:06] stinkketh, for he had been dead for for
[1:35:11] days." What the reactions of
[1:35:14] Martha? Jesus said, "Take away the
[1:35:17] stone,
[1:35:19] Martha." And she reasoned.
[1:35:22] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[1:35:24] said unto him,"Lord, by this time he
[1:35:26] thinkketh, for he had been dead four
[1:35:28] days." She didn't want to obey the
[1:35:31] message of the hour because of her
[1:35:32] reasoning.
[1:35:34] So her thinking needed to be changed.
[1:35:37] Amen. From reasoning to faith, right? It
[1:35:41] had first begin with a message and a
[1:35:43] change of thinking.
[1:35:46] Take away the
[1:35:47] stone. That's the message of the hour.
[1:35:50] So she need to take
[1:35:52] heed to the
[1:35:55] shout. And Jesus said unto her, I not
[1:36:00] unto thee that if thou wouldest believe,
[1:36:03] thou shouldest see the glory of God. So
[1:36:06] Jesus had to first deal with Martha's
[1:36:08] unbelief. Right? Yeah.
[1:36:12] And this is what the shout of the
[1:36:13] message came to do to change our
[1:36:15] thinking from reasoning against the word
[1:36:17] to faith in the word of God. And that is
[1:36:22] and and so this is also what happens to
[1:36:24] Mark that Jesus message changes her in
[1:36:27] her heart from reasoning to faith.
[1:36:31] God is dealing remember that he was not
[1:36:34] dealing with anybody else.
[1:36:36] He was exactly dealing with the church
[1:36:39] with Martha. You know sometimes we have
[1:36:42] still doubts but God will not stop
[1:36:46] dealing with you. Thank you Lord. Until
[1:36:48] you recognize
[1:36:50] the hour of your visitation.
[1:36:53] Amen. And then they took away the stone
[1:36:55] from the place where the dead was laid.
[1:36:57] And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,
[1:36:59] "Father, I thank thee that thou hast
[1:37:01] heard me." And I knew that thou hearest
[1:37:04] me always, but because of the people
[1:37:07] which stand by, I said that they may
[1:37:10] believe that thou have sent me. And when
[1:37:13] he does had spoken, he cried with a loud
[1:37:16] voice, Lazarus,
[1:37:19] comfort. So this resurrection is a name
[1:37:23] calling resurrection. Hallelujah. This
[1:37:25] is not a general resurrection yet. So he
[1:37:29] was a specific Lazarus come forth bride
[1:37:34] come forth in these last days. Amen.
[1:37:36] This message is for you not for anybody
[1:37:38] else. Come forth the bride.
[1:37:43] And he had and he was dead. And the
[1:37:46] dead And he that was dead came forth
[1:37:49] bound hand and foot with grave clothes,
[1:37:52] and his face was bound about with
[1:37:54] napkin. And Jesus said unto them, "Loose
[1:37:58] him and let him go."
[1:38:01] Lazarus was resurrected out of the tomb.
[1:38:04] Amen. But he was still bound.
[1:38:10] Just like we have been resurrected by
[1:38:12] the message of the hour. Yes. Calling
[1:38:15] our name, but we are still bound by the
[1:38:18] circumstances of our own flesh. That's
[1:38:21] right. So sometimes we struggle.
[1:38:24] But the word said turn loose. Amen.
[1:38:28] Always the message of the hour, we're
[1:38:30] turn loose. Whatever circumstances we
[1:38:32] are in, that's why faith cometh by
[1:38:34] hearing and that hearing by the word of
[1:38:35] God. Amen. It will be turned loose.
[1:38:37] Amen. Amen. And so sometimes we have
[1:38:39] struggle and we don't recognize we have
[1:38:41] already resurrected but the napkin the
[1:38:43] grave clothes is still around us. That's
[1:38:46] right. So we need the five-fold ministry
[1:38:49] to take away. Amen.
[1:38:52] That napkin.
[1:38:55] Hallelujah. So there had to be another
[1:38:58] part in order for Lazarus to be
[1:39:00] completely free. He needed to be loose
[1:39:03] from what was binding him. Just as the
[1:39:05] trump will release us from this old body
[1:39:09] that is binding us to this world.
[1:39:12] Hallelujah. Remember that Lazarus had a
[1:39:15] change of body from corruption to a
[1:39:18] healthy body again. Then straight after
[1:39:20] that he goes to the supper with the
[1:39:23] Lord.
[1:39:25] Glory. Amen. So God is showing us the
[1:39:30] sequence of event of the shout of the
[1:39:34] voice and the trump. Amen. So God is
[1:39:38] dealing each and every one of us. Then
[1:39:41] in chapter 12 verse two there they made
[1:39:45] him a supper and Martha served but
[1:39:49] Lazarus was one of them that sat on the
[1:39:52] table with him. Amen. The same Lazarus
[1:39:55] that was raised by the ministry of
[1:39:58] Christ in the form of the shout voice
[1:40:00] under the drum is now sitting with
[1:40:02] Christ at the supper table. Amen. This
[1:40:05] is showing that we who have come under
[1:40:08] the same ministry of the shout voice and
[1:40:10] dr in this hour are also the one who
[1:40:13] will s with him at the marriage supper
[1:40:15] of the lamb. Shall we stand? Revelation
[1:40:19] chapter nine. And the wife had made
[1:40:22] herself ready. Amen. Hallelujah. We are
[1:40:25] ready for the marriage supper of the
[1:40:27] lamb. That's right. We heard the shout
[1:40:29] and we have the voice and waiting for
[1:40:31] the last trump. Amen. So we have the
[1:40:34] last trump president in last days.
[1:40:38] The prophet came from United State.
[1:40:41] President came from United States and
[1:40:44] the pope came in the United States.
[1:40:46] Revelation chapter 13
[1:40:49] is fulfilling scripture in last days.
[1:40:51] Amen. So if it's beginning to fulfill
[1:40:54] how much more the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:40:56] there will be a shout there will be a
[1:40:58] change in these last days I will show
[1:41:01] you a mystery we shall not sleep but we
[1:41:05] shall all be changed. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:07] Hallelujah. So this is not my promise.
[1:41:10] It is the promise of God in our days. So
[1:41:13] this message is
[1:41:15] directly personally to each and every
[1:41:17] one of us. Amen. When you read your
[1:41:19] spoken word, make it personal. That's
[1:41:21] right.
[1:41:23] When you're listening to the tape, make
[1:41:25] it personal. Let God speak into your
[1:41:28] heart. You may be in
[1:41:31] doubt. Play the tape and listen.
[1:41:36] Because the message is directly to each
[1:41:38] and every one of us. Thank you, Lord.
[1:41:40] Because I sent you Elijah the prophet.
[1:41:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord.
[1:41:47] Every time you have a problem, every
[1:41:49] time something bothering in your heart.
[1:41:50] Thank you. Yes. Just take time. Thank
[1:41:53] you.
[1:41:56] Take time. Separate yourself from
[1:41:58] anything.
[1:41:59] Go to your closet, pray, listen,
[1:42:02] meditate upon the word of God. We can
[1:42:05] see that everything that we see around
[1:42:07] us prophecy being fulfilled. What is
[1:42:10] still what is there anything that we
[1:42:13] need to do?
[1:42:17] We just need to be sober, dedicated,
[1:42:21] watching
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:24] when the trump of God will take place
[1:42:26] one of these days. Hallelujah. Remember
[1:42:28] that we are
[1:42:29] already in the process. We receive the
[1:42:33] earnest of the rapture. We receive the
[1:42:35] earnest of the changing of our body
[1:42:38] because our body is subject to the word
[1:42:40] of God. Amen. We cannot help it
[1:42:43] sometimes.
[1:42:44] Sometimes we try try to run away from
[1:42:48] serving God. But if you are a seed of
[1:42:50] God, God will always point you back to
[1:42:52] his word because we cannot run away
[1:42:55] anymore. Our time has come. That's
[1:42:58] right. There is no turning back anymore.
[1:43:01] We just need to walk just like Enoch
[1:43:04] walked. Walk according to his grace and
[1:43:06] his mercy. Amen. Remember that you've
[1:43:09] bypassed your theopony in order to be
[1:43:12] tested. If you are a son of God, the
[1:43:15] word will manifest. The more testing,
[1:43:17] the more trial, the more manifestation.
[1:43:20] That's right. Hallelujah. Because
[1:43:23] everything is about you and him. Amen.
[1:43:27] You were in his mind before the
[1:43:29] foundation of God. You were in his
[1:43:31] thinking. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:43:34] That's why he wants to have a family of
[1:43:37] his own. That's right. Amen. What a
[1:43:40] mercy and grace. He chose us to be one
[1:43:42] of his family.
[1:43:45] Hallelujah. Let us bow our head.
[1:43:48] Hallelujah. Heavenly Father,
[1:43:51] we're so thankful, Lord, for your
[1:43:52] presence this morning. Yes, Lord. Thank
[1:43:54] you, Lord, for your word. Thank you,
[1:43:56] Lord God, for the
[1:43:58] promises that you open to us, Lord, this
[1:44:02] morning. Thank you, Lord, for giving us
[1:44:04] the inspiration. Thank you Lord for your
[1:44:06] predestination. Thank you Lord that your
[1:44:10] secret before the foundation of the word
[1:44:12] hallelujah was open in these last days
[1:44:14] to each and every one of us
[1:44:16] Lord. Oh help us Lord. Anybody here Lord
[1:44:20] God that's still in doubt Lord God. May
[1:44:22] your
[1:44:23] spirit give them more grace, more
[1:44:26] revelation.
[1:44:28] Open the eyes of their understanding
[1:44:30] Lord that they may
[1:44:35] see your purpose in this life Lord. We
[1:44:39] thank you for your love. Thank you for
[1:44:40] your mercy. Thank you for your
[1:44:43] grace. We want to say we love you Lord.
[1:44:47] Help us Lord to be more faithful, more
[1:44:50] dedicated Lord.
[1:44:53] Because without you Lord we can't do
[1:44:55] anything in our life. Amen. We are
[1:44:57] always a failure Lord. So help us Lord
[1:45:00] to completely trust you Lord.
[1:45:04] Completely give our lives to you Lord.
[1:45:06] Our spirit and our soul and our mind.
[1:45:09] Hallelujah. So help us Lord that we may
[1:45:12] become the manifestations of your word
[1:45:15] in these last days. Thank you Lord. We
[1:45:17] give you back and the honor. Want to say
[1:45:20] we love you so much. In Jesus Christ's
[1:45:23] name we pray.

[1:54:20] God. I love your voice.
[1:54:26] You have led me through the

[1:54:33] night. You are close like no
[1:54:38] other. I've known you as a
[1:54:42] father. I've known you as a
[1:54:47] friend. I have lived in the
[1:54:51] goodness of God.
[1:54:57] And all my life you have been
[1:55:05] faithful. And all my life you have been
[1:55:09] so so
[1:55:13] good. With every breath I am
[1:55:19] able. I will sing of the
[1:55:23] goodness. His goodness runs after
[1:55:28] me. Your goodness is running after.

[1:56:13] Running after me.
[1:56:16] With all my life laid down, I surrender
[1:56:19] now. I give you
[1:56:24] everything. Your goodness is running
[1:56:28] after. Running after. He's been
[1:56:34] faithful. And all my life you have been
[1:56:40] faithful. Hallelujah.
[1:56:43] And all my life you have been so so
[1:56:51] good. With every breath I am
[1:56:57] able. I will
[1:56:59] sing of the goodness. Sing it one more
[1:57:03] [Music]
[1:57:07] time. And all my life you have been.
[1:57:11] Brother James Terren, would you come?
[1:57:12] Remember the
[1:57:15] James? And all my life you have been so
[1:57:20] so
[1:57:23] good. With every breath that I am
[1:57:29] able, I will sing of the
[1:57:33] goodness of God.
[1:57:38] Yes, I will
[1:57:39] sing of the
[1:57:42] goodness of God. If he's been good, you
[1:57:45] give him praise.
[1:57:51] Hallelujah. All my life, he has been
[1:57:53] faithful. Brother James, if you would
[1:57:54] close our service in a word of prayer.
[1:57:56] Let's remember all those be traveling
[1:57:58] back this afternoon. May the Lord be
[1:58:00] with them. Amen.
[1:58:02] Amen. Let's just bow our hearts.
[1:58:07] Heavenly
[1:58:09] Father, Lord, once
[1:58:12] again, you've been mindful of us. Thank
[1:58:15] you, Lord,
[1:58:18] Lord, we commune with you all the time,
[1:58:21] but Lord, to gather together
[1:58:24] in one place and to just fellowship
[1:58:27] around your word, Lord, there's just
[1:58:29] nothing like that. Amen.
[1:58:31] It's just nothing that can replace this
[1:58:34] time that this opportunity that we've
[1:58:37] had. And Lord, we're so thankful. We
[1:58:39] just want to give you praise this
[1:58:41] morning, Lord. We want to lift our
[1:58:43] voices, Lord, and tell you what it means
[1:58:46] to us, Lord, that you thought about us
[1:58:49] once again, and that you said, "Welcome
[1:58:52] to my table." And you spread a meal this
[1:58:56] morning, Lord, that was met every need,
[1:58:59] Lord. Lord, there's been many things on
[1:59:01] the hearts of everyone, Lord, that come
[1:59:03] this morning. And we just know that
[1:59:05] you're mindful of them, Lord. You knew
[1:59:07] them before they were ever spoken, Lord,
[1:59:10] before they ever happened. Lord, you
[1:59:11] knew. And we just are once again asking
[1:59:13] you to remember those things, Lord. The
[1:59:15] campers, Lord, that'll be traveling back
[1:59:17] down the mountain. Lord, I pray that
[1:59:20] traveling mercies go with them, Lord. Be
[1:59:21] with the bus, Lord. Be with all of those
[1:59:23] in their individual vehicles, Lord. I
[1:59:25] just pray that you'd watch over them.
[1:59:27] May the angels Lord be around them and
[1:59:30] just protect them. Lord, we are so
[1:59:32] thankful this for this time. We just
[1:59:35] want to just praise you, Lord. I
[1:59:37] just nothing I wish there was words,
[1:59:40] Lord, that could just express what these
[1:59:43] times mean to us, Lord. Amen. But
[1:59:45] there's really not. But you know our
[1:59:47] heart, Lord. Hear it in Jesus name.
[1:59:51] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:54] Amen. Just as we go, let's sing Psalms
[1:59:57] 34. I sought the Lord, he answered me.
[2:00:00] How many can testify and say that he
[2:00:02] came on the scene when you needed him.
[2:00:04] Thank you, Lord. Amen. I sought the
[2:00:09] Lord and he answered
[2:00:13] me and delivered
[2:00:16] [Music]
[2:00:17] me from every
[2:00:21] fear. Those who look on
[2:00:25] him are
[2:00:29] radant. They'll never be
[2:00:33] ashamed. They'll never be ashamed.
[2:00:38] This poor man
[2:00:41] cried. And the Lord heard
[2:00:45] me and he saved me
[2:00:49] from my
[2:00:53] eneies. The son of
