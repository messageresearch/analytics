all I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus let's just stand go directly to the word amen God bless you all turn with me if you would thank you musicians and the song special certainly enjoyed that such lovely voices the Bible says let whosoever have breath let him praise the Lord how many of you got breath huh I don't see any dead people I see people breathing I trust all of you give him praise tonight and I thank God for what he's done for me how he opened his my eyes I wasn't raised in church mud and raised in a religious family Jesus Christ was a cuss word in our home and yet God by his grace Hallelujah I thank God it wasn't anything I did it was just God and His grace come down called me huh and when I heard this I knew I said that's it that's it pearl of great praise I saw it and since God has opened my eyes to this message is becoming clearer and clearer and I love it more and more and and I'll tell you what saints of God the more that I read of the message of the hour more to the light it comes upon the word to show us where we're at amen amen turn with me if you would to the Book of Leviticus Leviticus 19. Leviticus 19 then we'll go to Deuteronomy 22. then we'll go to Matthew 13. praise the Lord I love to see people turning their Bibles amen the word of God is a lamp unto our feet I believe the prophet of God told us he said every day a Christian prays and reads their Bible amen amen Leviticus 19. and verse 19. he shall keep my statutes Thou shalt not let thy candle cattle um gender with a diverse kind Thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed neither shall a garment mingled of linen and Woolen come upon you I want you to notice Thou shalt not sow thy feed thy field with mingled seed Deuteronomy chapter 22 and verse 9. Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with diverse seeds lest the fruit of thy seed which thou has sown and the fruit of thy Vineyard be defiled now turn with me to the Book of Matthew chapter 13. and verses 24 through 30. another Parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field and while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did thou not so good seed in thy field and from whence then half of Tears and he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servant said unto him well thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let them grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles and burn them but gather the wheat into my barn may God add the blessing the reading of his word you all may be seated tonight in his presence amen amen I would like to take for a short while this evening is what God has been dealing with me on is about I'd like to title this sermon maybe a little bit unusual and just hang on with me as a um as I lay the foundation for this this evening circumcising this message under the seventh seal and I would like to take a subject of the Bride field is to receive the bridegroom seed Now understand that we know that biologically a man is a giver of seed biologically a woman is a receiver of seed and whatever is sown into the woman she takes it and she multiplies it and we know that according to God's law in Genesis 1 11 that every seed will bring forth of its own kind the prophet of God said if you plant corn you will not get wheat he said if you plant a watermelon you will not get a grapefruit those are things that are under God's law and I want you to understand that there is a law within every seed it just has to be planted and watered and you will not know that seed of what it is until it begins to get fruit and by its fruit you'll know it now we know that everything works according to God's law and according to his season and we know and we recognize that the Rapture of the church and the Harvest is soon to come we know that we can see the flashing red lights of the signs of his coming saints of God he's coming and he's coming soon he's shown it in the signs in the heavens he's shown it here on Earth he's had his Prophet come and reveal to us the word of God we have no excuse we've all got to be ready and if you miss it it's because you missed it because the bride has made herself ready then we realize that the seed has got to be planted in the right kind of ground it has to be in the bedding ground of faith not a non-believer end doubt not in immaturity of mind not some kind of theological betting ground of carnal intellect the Apostle Paul says how do you want me to come to you with intellectual words of man's Wisdom or with power and demonstration God help us that we go beyond our carnal understanding and come into a spiritual understanding of God's word because the Bible says that to be carnally minded is eminently with God and neither can it know the things of God how can you explain explain to people spiritual things if they don't have a basis of Christianity you must be born again in order to understand the kingdom of God the rapture is not just the catching away it's not just an event I want you to understand that the resurrection is a person Jesus said I am the resurrection when he talked to Mary and Martha about their brother Lazarus and they he said that talk to him about the resurrection she said yes I know my brother will come up in the resurrection and Jesus said those powerful wonderful words of I am the resurrection and I am the life and he that believeth in me how many of you believe tonight listen you can't make yourself believe either God put it in there for you to believe or you don't have it right there's something that is inside every seed that causes them when they hear the word of God to say yea and amen even if they don't understand it so the Rapture is just not an event it's a person for Jesus is the resurrection and he is the line now brother Brennan in the sermon what is the Holy Ghost he picks us up because that God made a covenant with Abraham after he'd called Abraham which is a type of calling the believer today I want all of you to identify with this he called Abraham Abraham moved out of his country went into a Strange Land to dwell among strange people and that was the type of when God calls a man to stop his meanness repent of his sins and he turns then from the crowd that he was in to live in a new crowd among new types of people then after God found Abraham to be faithful to the promises that God gave him he that would have a child and through this child all the Earth would be blessed then God confirmed his faith by giving him a sign and that sign was circumcision and circumcision is a type of the Holy Spirit my brother my sister rapturing Faith is laying in those messages but it's not just hearing a tape that causes you to understand it's not just reading a message book that causes you to understand you've got to have the Holy Spirit because the holy spirit is the Divine revealer of God's word amen but rapturing faith will not become mature until the promises of the hour are embraced by a mature virgin mind of the Bride of this hour it's got to be the right field it's got to be a seasoned field a prepared field I remember the Song of Solomon hell that he said those poetic words oh my spouse my garden how that I want to come unto thee early in the morning how that I want to plant my seed and he goes on and on and it's not just a metaphor about a uh a garden but it's a metaphor about God and his church even when Paul said I show you a greater mystery than just a man and woman I want to show you a mystery between Christ and his church in the resume of the ages brother Brenham says there then must come upon the scene in this age those who will bring the wheat and tears to maturity the tares are already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers somebody say Amen all you got to do is look around you and see the corrupt teachers they're in the politics they're in the schools they're everywhere they're on YouTube and all of them are trying to turn the people from the word in fact the Bible says all those whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall be deceived so we find out when you look at this and who would have ever thought that America would change so rapidly as what we've seen in the last few years I mean where are the common people with common sense in fact when you look and you see the radical things that are going in and people don't know their gender they they they have no moral compass homes are destroyed schools are destroyed there are the home life and everything is just being torn down why is it because corrupt teachers are trying to take the people away from the word God help us give us Ministry that'll preach the word to the people and bring them back to God's healing line I don't want to go to a church it's just a few good church tell everybody we're all gone because not everybody's going only a word living bride listen do not cheapen the token of God do not bring the standard of God's word down to the people you want to raise the people up to God's standards because if you ever lower a standard you'll never get it back so he says the Terrors are already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who turn the people from the word but the weed also must mature and to her God is sending the prophet somebody say Amen it was sent to you why to mature you messenger with a Vindicated Ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they will hear him as the first church hurt Paul and she will mature in the word until becoming a wordbride the mighty Works will be found in her that are always attended upon the pure word and faith now as much as we don't like to see what's happening even in America in our schools in our governments we've got to realize that all of this has got to come to pass so that we see that they will become mature under their corrupt teachers now let me tell you there it seems to me that they are becoming very very mature right now in their corruption so what does that tell us about you and I if they're maturing what about you and I we should be maturing to a far greater level than where we're at God help us to rise to the place where God wants us to be turning the minds of the people the Bible says that they would be believe a lie and be damned in the sermon to show us the father now father help us tonight and open the word to us open our understanding circumcise the lips of your servant that speaks and circumcised the hearts of the people that the word may fall in that it may fall in Rich fertile ground and bring forth a hundred fold and may there not be a feeble one Among Us after tonight may it be over tonight everyone with faith father granted now may the Holy Spirit take the things of God and deliver them right out to the people for we ask it in Jesus the name of the son of God Jesus Christ Now understand he says God circumcised my lips but circumcised the hearts of the people that they're that their their hearts would be ready to receive the word with good fertile ground if you read your Bible I don't want you to read it as you read a book I want you to read it with understanding I would rather you read five verses and pray and seek God's understanding of those five verses then five chapters and you don't even remember what book you were in the Bible says with all of your getting get understanding amen so circumcision is a sign that was given to Abraham that God had received his faith understand then this principle that God gives the Revelation to the believer is that right God gives you revelation what should you be praying for revelation and so when you pray and God gives you revelation and then you understand it and you apply it to your life God cannot reject what he gave to you he cannot reject himself why if he was given you that revelation of how to please him that when you do it guess what he says that's righteousness I received that and when Abraham by faith believed God God said that's righteousness and it was imputed unto him amen everything that the believer does he does by faith in fact one of my favorite chapters in the Bible is Hebrews 11. and I remember as a young Christian and reading this this book of Hebrews one time with some real understanding and went across and faith is the substance of things so for any evidence of Things Not Seen and for by it faith the elders obtained a good report by faith Abraham by faith Noah by faith Jeremiah it just goes on and on and every one of the sentences almost uh verse by verse says and by faith and so understand that the very uh link between all of them on their servitude to God is faith and so you need to have faith in your life not education education only goes so far I've had young people and older people alike that have been raised up and know the precepts of this message they know the concepts they know about how that a woman should dress a man should dress how we should act in our lives but if you are not upon the solid rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ and when the the the things of Life Starts coming against you and the wind comes and the rain falls and great is the fall of it if it's not on the solid rock Enoch walked by faith and God took him Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness I think I told you one time that when I went through the book of Hebrews there in Hebrews 11 and talked about Abraham and Sarah and when all the different ones and japheth and Samson and it named the different ones and if you ever take the time to study who they were and what they did you will think oh my look at Samson look at the failure that he was and yet he is recorded I want to let me just tell you the concept that I received when I read that the fact is at the end of the road and when we stand before God God's eulogy about you is different why he didn't see your mistakes why because they were under the blood our Crimson sins under the blood turn white and when we ask Christ to forgive us guess what you're forgiven as though you never did it now when I look at the life of Abraham and I see him stagger I see him going into Hagar I see him lying I see him giving his wife away to save his own neck I see him staggering but the Bible says he's staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief that's God's eulogy of Abraham how would you like to have God's eulogy be read about you and God says he's staggered not he was in laudiusia he never bowed to the god of fashion he never he huh Hallelujah he was faithful unto death praise God amen faith in the sermon Israel and the church he called Abraham by election he calls the church by election he gave Abraham the promise Abraham believed it and he calls the church today watch how he always says Abraham the church talks about Abraham elect how about the church you're elect he always brings you into the picture you believe Jesus Christ then the first you believe and then God hit Abraham and his children his seeds circumcised as a sign and he gives you the holy gaze the Holy Ghost today as a sign what is only goes to a human being when it comes to circumcise amen the Holy Ghost is a circumcision and what circumcision do cuts off Surplus flesh all the things of the world it circumcises you away from the things of the world the love of the world the love of the Flesh and the pride of life it just circumcises you from that you have nothing to do with it it does it itself and put you in love with Jesus Christ with undying love amen in the sermon power of transformation and that seed will take a hold somewhere glory to God the only thing he's looking for today is a betting ground somewhere that it can bid it started in Eve for her bed forth and bring forth Sons of God not Sons of Satan but she was a betting ground and it fell in the wrong place now remember my subject of the Bride field is for the bridegroom seed so she was a betting ground and fell in the wrong place so the word fall so will the word fall in an unbeliever or a doubter or a skeptic it'll make a church member out of them but never a son or daughter of God you tell them to let their hair grow they'll laugh in your face you tell them to do this or that and the man to do what they'll laugh in your face it's not sons of God it's the wrong betting ground yet they're holding the seed see the false anointed ones they're anointed yes with the Holy Spirit speak in tongues do signs and wonders but it's of Satan that is a powerful statement but we must have the bidding ground of faith it has to be mature to be able to receive rapturing seed Sarah could not bring forth the promise seed until she cast out all her unbelief do you remember the first time that she hears the angel and it says and your wife is going to bring forth a son and she laughed within her cell and God caught her laughing he said why did Sarah laughed and she denied it and what's an amazing thing is God could have and would have taken her life for lying to him to his face but he couldn't do it why because she was a part of Abraham and if he took her he would hurt Abraham and because she was a part of Abraham she was a part of Abraham's Covenant because he was she was under that same Covenant guess what she was under the same promises understand my brother my sister that when God calls the man he calls the wife Hallelujah now Sarah her unbelief would not allow her to embrace the promise that was given to her because her mind was so carnal at times that she was thinking how can these things be Mary said the same thing listen those people in the Bible are no different than you and I we tend to think oh my these people you know and Angels coming to them surely they were great Believers surely when they saw the the tomb was empty surely when they see you saw the grave close was there and there was no body surely when the tomb was open they would have all said Hallelujah he is risen they didn't they wandered within themselves so much of the time our mind keeps us from seeing what God is doing around us Jesus appeared many times and they thought he was a spirit of course you would too if he came walking on the water and they were afraid he said be not afraid it is I Lord if that be you then bid me to come Peter's a fisherman he's raised on the water Lord if that's really you bid me come Peter come you know I I like this let's brag about Peter for a moment he's the only one yeah yeah he began to sink yeah but you know what I want to praise him because Peter had courage enough to get out of the boat amen I can just imagine once in a while Peter said they asked him what was it like was it soft or hard how did it feel to walk on water my brother my sisters too much of the time we stay in our boat and we're afraid to step out of our little comfort zone but you know what I believe that every exploit of faith that is ever going to be done by the Bride of Jesus Christ you are going to have to get out of your comfort zone who am I why should I speak to this who am I how can I I'm just a housewife I I you know I'm nobody special I'm not a preacher how can I pray over my own kids listen prop the prophet said every one of you have a commission when your kids are sick lay hands on them Kill Em God will heal them do those things you speak the word I love that fact to that one woman that failed to pray for the woman that had a child in the prayer line and the whole time she is denying it no Lord she's gonna go up before the prophet I don't need to go pray for that baby she had such compassion until finally she just couldn't hold it back any more and she have you ever had times like that where you just hey go do it go do it go do it and finally she went okay okay I'll do it she went up there and she said I'm so sorry excuse me I know you're in the prayer line and everything but do you mind if I pray for your little baby would you mind if I said a prayer oh no please pray now here's the amazing thing the mother brings the little child up is there before the prophet he lays his hands on the he says your child is already healed oh you know when your baby got healed when that sister failed to go pray for your baby God healed that baby Now understand what the principle here of what God is teaching us it doesn't have to be the minister it doesn't have to be anybody great you just have to be led of the spirit you have to be willing you have to be sensitized and the way to sensitize your spirit is by prayer and seeking the mind of God prayer softens your spirit so that you can hear him because he says still small voice amen the bride is to lay in the presence of the Sun she used to lay there until all of the greenness and all the immaturity is to be taken out of her and so I want you just as the natural sunlight shines upon whether it be the wheat or the trees or whatever it brings everything to fruition and so it is with the bride the prophet of God said that little bride she's got to lay before the presence of the Sun and that sunlight is to take the greenness out of her and she's to be a mature brine amen if you want the right kind of harvest you got to run sow the right kind of seed understand this principle you'll never have a raptured church until you had a raptured teaching there's got to be raptured sermons Rapture sermons with rapturing faith in order to bring forth the raptured church amen if you're going to sow for the rapture has got to come a time when you start sowing rapturing Faith to the bride and understand that it couldn't be done or sown under the first pull because the first poll was just healing it was the outer core it's the flesh many were healed that never followed the Lord it couldn't be done under the second pool that's discernment that's the spirit that's the inner Court you had the outer Court inner Court and so you can even operate the gifts of the Spirit like Caiaphas who prophesied you can work the gifts of the Spirit and it'd be the genuine Holy Spirit on you speaking in tongues you can do all those things and prophesy and your soul not having Christ sitting on your throne room so the third poll is the revealing of the word and it's down into the soul which is the heart of man Thy word o God oh Lord if I hid in my heart that I learn not to sin against you so the third pull Ministry watch this the word being revealed in such a way that it's a separation it's a circumcision I want you to understand that when the sword was uh came into the prophet's hand what was God doing he's giving a sharp two-edged sword and now he's going to take the prophet of God and he's going to cut away all of the carnal fleshly intellectual teachings of man and he's going to bring forth a pure word all of the flesh all of the intellectual teachings all of the probings and though they were great men and intellectual this bride in order to be raptured she had to have a rapturing message she had to have a pure message why she's going to be a pure word bride do you understand it you got to preach the pure word and have the word circumcised away from all of denominational teaching he's not father-son Holy Ghost he's Lord Jesus Christ there's only one not three hear o Israel the Lord your God is one God so now this seventh angel when he's caught up into the consolation of seven angels what God is doing he's doing something Supernatural he's being lifted up and when he's being lifted up and he came into the constellation of these angels and each one of them had a mystery of a seal that he would give to the prophet of God and so this understanding brother brenham's carnal understanding of all that he's been taught now remember when he goes to preach the seals he says God is revealed in simplicity he says Now understand when these saints come up before you it's so simple many people will Overlook it but God is revealed in Simplicity and he had to pull himself away from influence of people stay in a room and wait before God and I'll tell you most of you the reason you don't hear more from God is you never wait on him you never you you pray and you get up you never Terry you never stay there on your knees and wait because you know what you've been talking to God but you wait for him to talk to you I remember one time when I was in a real quandary and there was no work to be had the economy went bad and I I was Roofing and Roofing was snowing every other day in Flagstaff that winter and you go to work and they say we got no work today it's snowing and and I I just was having a hard time financially I went to McDonald's I went to Jack In The Box I went everywhere I'll take any job any job I can find and I remember they built a brand new Ralston purina plant up in Flagstaff and I had a friend of mine Brother Ray Robson who's got a degree in college and in business and stuff and you know I didn't get a degree in college and he said brother Ron he said why don't we go and apply at Ross and Purina I said I I said okay I mean I'll try anything and we went that day in and Ray is always early like myself he just happens to go early the line of cars to go in the gate just to apply was over a mile and a half long I looked at I said good grief turn around there's 6 000 people applying for about 120 jobs I thought you know well so we just we no races no no hey we're gonna wait in line we're going to do it come on Ron and so anyway I went in and signed a deal and and uh I just kind of forgot about it and I went home and I I got in desperation with God sometimes that's what it takes with each one of you and it takes a time of desperation and I was I I just was weeping I was there on I remember it was a bedroom that our son Amos a little bedroom for the for him had the little bassinet up there in front of us in the little place of the kid sleeps I was on the floor and had this rug and I had my hands in the floor in the rug there and I'm crying and I'm really crying out before God and I'm pouring my soul out and I said father I need work I says I'm not lazy I'll go I will work it doesn't matter father I just need a job and I cried and I said oh Lord if he just you're a Waymaker now my father watch this and show you how the devil will dangle something in front of you my father says son because I told him I'm having a hard time he said my father having been a jockey knows all the professional horse racing he knows everybody in the business and and because my father was famous he said uh my father happened to talk to this one trainer and he said hey I got a job for your son if he wants to take it it's over in California and he can run a ranch over here and have horses and he'll have a truck an expense and oh man yeah yeah and oh well I'll just go over there for a couple years and I'll take care of that ranch and no God told me get out of California so here I am and I'm in this quandary and oh just having a hard time and holy spirit spoke to me saints of God I lie not behind his sacred desk there was a voice that spoke to me and said which job do you want and I said I want a job at Ross and Purina and I spoke it out loud there was a voice that said and what's amazing as I hear this voice and I answer out loud I want a job at Ross and Purina I said it and okay there was nothing else Thou shalt have the job no no there was enough bolts of lightning there was nothing I wasn't oh yes no I just wiped my eyes okay I don't know what I'm gonna do next day I get a a letter in the mail and it says you're you're you have to go in for an interview hi Glenda again I have an interview they said okay you get hired I'm hired yeah yeah well you have to take a physical okay I know I'll pass a physical anyway uh uh I said hey uh how many people were hired before me they said you're the first out of 6 000 applicants I was the first employee hired and they said well you can go in and Char you can choose your locker your locker number what key you want and everything guess what Locker number I wanted number seven yeah I want number seven seventh completion and so anyway I'm just telling you that a lot of time saints of God when you get into a place and you are desperate before God and you get on your knees and you cry after you get done crying and after you get done praying and after you put your petition before God wait give him time to answer and keep your spirit softened okay because he will speak to you if you seek you shall find if you ask it shall be given if you knock the door shall be opened but you've got to do something and so I want all of you to understand this principle that if you get in desperation before God God will answer you in fact brother Branham said yeah he said it's too too bad that you have to get in Desperate situations to get God to move but a lot of times you have become complacent and lukewarm and you haven't been really serious do you know God knows when you're serious if you don't think God knows when you're serious my dog knows when I'm serious or not my cute little schnauzer Edelweiss yeah that's what we named her Edelweiss because she's German the other one was Schatzi which means treasure anyway I can be you know I will say hey get down from there and the dog will look at me like but if I got that voice hey get them like that and then she just and she's looking at me like okay today I was riding a bicycle I got way far away from him she's a football field behind me I'm sitting here did a coyote get her where is she here's this little white dot I said Ada Ada get down there she looks at me sniffs around the bush a little bit off to run and she comes she's coming up to me and I'm standing there with my hand on my hip and she knows yeah and I go to walk toward her and her Hind and went down towards the ground like what I said stay with me all of you know that when you're serious or when God is serious with you and he tells you hey don't have lag back behind Stay With Me come walk with me stay right here you know when God is serious he's got that tone about you mom you know when you're speaking to your kids they know when you're serious or not when they use your full name oh yeah yeah okay my my mom used to count to three okay you better you better be here one two huh and we never moved until right before three isn't that the nature of uh huh she didn't go one two three States God knows how to get your attention and he knows when you're serious and he says if you will seek me you shall find me if you will actually come before me and bring your petition I will answer you God circumcised this message with the opening of The Seven Seals he took away all of the fleshly and carnal teachings of different ones down Through the Ages and brought to us a pure word it had to be it had to cut away everything it was false everything that was wrong and when the prophet was caught up into those seven angels you know what God was doing he was taking this message and giving it lip to ear to his prophet you have to sow an unadulterated seed to grow an under unadulterated Harvest if you sow her hybrid seed you'll get a hybrid Harvest if you sow a mingled seed you will get a mingled Harvest if you sow a corrupted seed you will get a corrupted Harvest it must be a pure word seed to produce a pure word bride restoration the bride tree God has set all of his laws to serve him both natural and spiritual working according to his word regardless of the conditions I love that I have a scripture on that yes sir God sets all of his laws in motion ever if God ever set a law of in motion then we can recognize the law and we can put that law into effect and reap the same results let me give you an example in Hosea 8 verse 7 it says for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the Whirlwind now this is both natural and spiritual because if you sow to the wind you shall reap a whirlwind but if you sow to the world you shall reap worldly things but if you sow to the spirit and you walk in the spirit you shall reap a whole Whirlwind of spiritual blessings and do you know that you will reap according to proportion the Bible says in second Corinthians 9 and 6 but this I say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully it is reward according to proportion how much time did you put in with God this past week and you want these great blessings and you want air and I need this and I want that is your prayer life nothing but I want or God do or please give wouldn't it be nice that God here's your prayer sometime and all you do you're never ask him for anything but you praise him for all the goodness that he's done for you father thank you that I had a good bed to sleep in thank you I have a home thank you I have food in the closet thank you I have a refrigerator it's full thank you I have a wife that loves me thank you Lord thank you for health in my body thank you Father for your many Bountiful blessings thank you for Calvary Lord thank you for Eternal salvation thank you Lord that I have a home in heaven thank you Lord Thou Art so merciful and just go on and on and thank him and never ask him for nothing I tell you what what works on me is when my wife comes over and she starts doing good things honey would you like some tea oh yes thank you sweetheart that'd be lovely would you like a little snack to go with it now when when there's two or three things line up in a row okay what do you want how about that with you do you when you come before God why don't you do things nice and say good and nice things to him and then he says what do you want my good and faithful servant what can I do for you today oh my too much of the time we go about our daily business without ever taking time for him and when we do we're too rushed huh hurry up Lord and bless me when it would be in a whole lot better for you to read two verses and say father make these verses fruitful to my mind that I know because thou art a lamp unto my feet thou art a a shield under my soul you father are going to to bring me into the place that you want me to be but father reveal yourself to me in a special way and let me be in a let me be a light to somebody else today because you know what you will never win anybody to believe what you believe and if you're not happy about what you believe when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be you can tell by the way that I'm singing that I'd rather be playing golf or somewhere else huh you know what it would be good to put the camera on each one of you when we have time for song service and it would just come down and put it right there on you and everybody else is clapping and you're sitting there hey wait a second well I want you to join in you ever had a heavy load you got to go pick it up and you sit there and strain yeah I was doing that the other day hey I drained my two-man hot tub yeah I got a little spa for outside I drained that thing I need to move it oh man Sandy and I tried to move it I'm straining so hard sandy pictures but anyway I'm I'm trying to move this thing and I'm yeah like this well anyway all right if Sandy goes get the boys over here yeah come on get Boaz and these guys you know these guys are like oh yeah look they sing out they move it he can do it by himself I'm glad I've got a grandson that lives right next door I don't know why he said all those things I'm just having fun visiting with you guys tonight I am do you know what saints of God let me just tell you right now I'm in love with Jesus Christ and I love this message and you will never win anybody to what you believe unless you're happy about what you got amen amen listen seeds of God we should be happy about everything I read a quote today wow I read a quote today it says any of you ever have your temper tantrum you ever had a deal where you just got yeah you ever have one of those days and don't tell on yourself my brother Ram said you watch that because it'll cause cancer he says you losing control of your temper which is next to insanity he says you will pay for it in your body you'll get a cancer or some kind of tumor because he says you know what you should do you should be happy so I'm going to tell all of you be happy so next time somebody else starts throwing a just tell them hey hey you don't want cancer be happy what are you talking about the prophet of God was telling us it's a very good quote go look it up so yeah Abraham tried to bring the word of God to pass himself with his own carnal understanding and when he did he didn't bring nothing to pass except for an ishmaelite a wild man a lot of times we try to bring something to pass because of the way we think it's going to be and we put our own interpretation to it or we put a speculation to what we think God is going to do or how he's going to bring the word to pass what we need is revelation not speculation because every time that we have speculation which is people trying to make the word come to pass through their understanding and God is his own interpreter he don't need your help he don't need you to try to figure it out in fact he said by his Prophet every time you got it figured out there's one thing you know for sure you're wrong so I'm not gonna waste my time trying to figure it out well what if how's it going to be what what how will it be how quickly when when we're going to get changed in a moment you know I'm afraid of heights what about in the air I don't like being in the air would it be relax Ed yeah any of you afraid of heights really anybody here afraid of heights my wife is raise your hand Sani she's afraid to hide she wouldn't even raise her hand if you're afraid of heights think about this and we'll be caught together with him in the air do you think of yourself floating up in the airplane okay no no it's not going to be like we think in the air is another dimension in fact saints of God brother Ram said if you think that you're going to go off past the white Milky Way fast and this and he said forget it you're just changing dimensions hallelujah we're not going off somewhere else we're changing a dimension in fact Stephen Hawking one of the greatest Minds that of this generation Stephen Hawking wrote a a book called A Brief History of Time and I got that and you know what I never go to the library I never go through a library looking for books but I just happened to pick that book up that day I thought oh this would be interesting quantum physics and I want to go ahead and I want to see what one of the brightest mind has to do about A Brief History of Time and he says we can prove by quantum mechanics and physics that there is an equal and opposite World in an anti-matter world that is a it is the same image of what you have here but made of anti-matter and he says it's just another dimension in fact he said if you ever meet your anti-self he said if your your other body ever comes up whatever you do don't shake hands with it this is this is Stephen Hawking don't do it because he said you will disappear into a ball of light and I thought because God is light and he says watch this he said if we could take man and go to the speed of light he says we can prove time stops if we can go to the speed of light time stops in fact they say our astronauts go off the Earth orbit around a little bit go to the Moon whatever come back and they're younger than they would have than they would have been if they'd have stayed here on Earth okay how they figure that out I don't know was it the watch they were I don't know I just believe what they told me so but if we could go to the speed of light time stops what if I go go past the threshold of the speed of light watch this all of a sudden now I can reverse time now Stephen Hawking says we can prove that the earth started with a big bang bang and God said let to be light bang I don't care how they call it I don't care how far back they take it guess what God started this whole thing with a bang and he says and since that being everything has been going and going and going and the universe is expanding but they said we can tell that it's reaching its maximum place and he says it's starting to stop and slow down and it's ready to start coming back and he says because you know what it's going to come back to its original position all saints of God I tell you what this message is so amazing the more I read it and the more that I see a man with a seventh grade education look into these things can look into the very word of God and begin to show us the Mysteries of God and all the things remember now the seventh angel has got no particular mystery it's it's not anything specific he's got he takes all of the Loose Ends yes he takes part of Clarence Larkin yes he takes part of his love to Babylon yes he takes free niacin father yes so some of those that say oh well the prophet he took some from this guy and some from Luther and Wesley and yes yes yes he did they were all men of God but this seventh angel he begins to take the very mystery of God he goes beyond the beginning of time he goes he says he he says in the beginning was the word he says today I want to go before the beginning there was never a preacher ever in that ever said let's go beyond before the beginning when God was not a God when he was not a being of worship when he was accountant a fountain of colors and he had all these attributes and he wasn't even God because a god is an object of worship and he wanted to be a savior and he wanted to be a redeemer and he had all these attributes I wanted to have a family and I wanted to and he says and there all of these attributes this Fountain of colors he says and he says out of that colors came up a clinker when it was the logos he said the very thought of God and he said the logos thought it blew it come off to you out of this Fountain of colors and there it was the logos and in the beginning was the logos and the logos was God and the logos came out of God and the logos took on a form and became a flesh being so that you and I because you and I have a problem we cannot love something that we don't understand how can we have a relationship with something that we can't see so what God did is he came down in the form of human flesh so that they could see they could handle and he became a man of like passion like you and I but without sin but he did it so he could be tempted in all manners like you so if you ever are in a trouble and you're having a hard time guess what you can say father I'm having a hard time and you were tempted with this so you know what I'm going through Solomon said there's nothing new Under the Sun everything is Vanity and vexation of spirit Solomon says Hey here I go and I can get all this stuff and everything everything that my mind and my eyes wanted to conceive and everything I wanted to have God gave it to me and he said you know what he says and God gives me all of this and I've got children that don't have wisdom and when I die they're going to take it and just foolishly spend it it's vexation a spirit imagine it's all vanity what is success what makes you happy huh when are you going to be happy when you reach the Pinnacle I'll get my four-year degree and I'll I'll make sixty thousand dollars and then I'm happy no you make 60 you want 160. you make 160 you want 260 and then 360 and pretty soon hey yeah these guys that are multi-billionaires they never quit they're working all the time it's not fair they're making more money none of them retire they're still boss of the company anyway saints of God I began to look at this message from a different perspective when God began to say move away from the message of being so close to it stand back and get an overview wow and when you stand back and you get an overview of this message and you just read the sermon titles you're following now the evolution follow this you're following the evolution of the mystery of God being revealed and you see how God is dealing with his Prophet have you ever heard you can't see the forest for the trees well some people all they do is they read but they they're they're looking so intently they got their head down here like this and I think a lot of you young kids this is how you're going to read when you get older because you sit on the couch and you've got a little iPad or you got a little iPhone and it's about six or eight inches from your face and they're saying it's ruining the eyes hello you watch him one of the worst babysitters you can ever give your kid but you know what kids throwing a fit wow shut up here get an iPad here iPhone play with it it's true you let them play with a loaded gun here 357 kid just stay away from the trigger are you kidding me huh no you you wouldn't do that when Bill Gates and and the other guy what Steve Jobs yeah you know what hey my own kids are not getting a cell phone or an iPad or a computer until they're 18. tell your kids that are 10 years old you don't get one well everybody else in the church has got one give me your cell phone let me play with it I don't let my kids play with it because they locked me out of it or they change the parameters next thing you know I got a problem I got viruses all no no no you don't play with my cell phone anyway I don't know why I'm saying all this stuff here tonight I've just kind of scattered around here tonight I'm in overtime right now musicians come come on come on I have it finished that's okay you ever come to church and you're having a hard day and you don't feel like praising you don't feel like worshiping you ever had that day every one of you will have a day like that I don't want to pop your bubble I don't want to uh make you think that you are going to have some trials but Jesus said they that live Godly shall suffer persecution you will be hated for my namesake people won't like you if you want to be liked don't be a Christian I used to carry my Bible to school four years in high school I carried my Bible to school I had a young young guy come up to me said hey you're such a weakling you have to carry your Bible to school I said here you carry it if you think it takes a weakling you carry it I used to sit at my lunch hour under a tree on my school campus and I had Bible study Elias just a young boy I didn't know what I was doing all I knew is I loved God and I loved his Bible and we said next thing I know a couple guys couple girls we sit there we pray and in my yearbook you know you know how you pass your yearbook around and everybody signs it it's amazing I went back and read a lot of the it says Ron we know what you're probably going to be when you grow up probably going to be a preacher somewhere I never wanted to be a preacher but I know this I loved him [Music] never forget the first time I went to a Bible study never been in a Bible study never been around Christians never no we sat in a circle we sat on the floor Hollis Allen was the Presbyterian minister you know what I liked about Holland Hollis he was genuine he was real I don't know how old he was maybe he was 45 he looked like an old man to me here I am 1450. we sit down on the floor and they pass out Bibles and okay everybody takes time to read and it came time for me to read my verse and so I'm reading my Bible verse because you know what I can read I went to school so I know how to read so I read my verse and I was rudely interrupted by somebody saying praise the Lord that's spiritual food are that strong meat and I'm going [Music] what are you talking about and I'm just thinking it's rude for you to interrupt me so I'll go ahead are you done yeah yeah I'm done okay can I finish I started finish and somebody else now yeah that was so good [Music] I never forget I said father what do they see that I don't it's not fair Lord if they see something and it's genuine and they get excited show me and then let me accept or reject because I don't know that I'll accept it I I'm skeptical I've seen a lot of people who claim to be Christians and some of them were the worst that I knew [Music] I'll never forget the time that I asked Jesus Christ to come into my life wasn't a big deal but Hollis right there with maybe 10 12 kids that's all it was and he said is there anybody here that you'd like to give your life to Christ and I didn't know what that was all I knew is I fell in love with somebody called Jesus he died for my sins I there was something about Jesus that pulled me and so I did and he led me in a sinner's prayer and when I got done and I got outside there were telephone wires telephone poles power lines above us as high as this ceiling and I says I feel like it can reach up and grab I feel like I said I'm so light I feel like I could run forever what it was was all of the burdens of all of life was to he said cast all your cares on me take my yoke upon you my yoke is easy and my burden is light and for the first time in my life as a young man I felt freedom because everything else in life bound me your friends will bind you drugs will bind you everything will bind you but first this is the first time I feel free wow because the Bible says that he whom the son has set free is free indeed and the reason that I can stand up here before all of you tonight not because I'm something special I'm just an ordinary guy who fell in love with God and I love him so much that I'm a fool for Christ I am the first book that I ever read was called the oddball guess what brother Bobby I became the oddball I identify with the oddball I am I'm odd I am weird the Bible calls you a peculiar people yeah you are and I know this I love him and I know he's coming soon and he's putting it upon my heart to tell all of you get ready get ready because he's coming and he's coming soon amen God bless you thank you for coming here tonight our visitors each and every one of you sometimes you come and you preach and you got some fiery ball sermon and yes you're preaching loud and there are other times you just kind of visit with you well tonight was Dad sitting around a table and just kind of visiting with you is that okay once in a while sit down and visit with you you can scream and yell at your kids and try to tell them I tell you what you better constrain that you better get down there what happens when you Harden your son's heart when you yell at him too much they quit listening to you [Music] if you ever sit down [Music] hey son how you doing you doing okay yeah I've been praying for you I noticed that I notice that you're struggling a little bit Mark don't take this seriously I'm not talking to you this is make believe here you doing okay son do you know that when people really care about how you're doing it affects you huh when they hate man you doing okay hey buddy hey bro hey dude yeah good praise God you can tell him I'm having a horrible day they'll still say hey praise God yeah amen because they're not listening to you but when somebody says you doing okay maybe tonight I'm sitting here I'm sitting right next to you and I'm lowering my voice I'm saying hey you doing okay are you all right because sometimes you can be looking okay on the outside and you're hemorrhaging on the inside you're hurting so bad but you're going through the motions I want you to all understand that Jesus Christ he cares for you and he says cast all of your burdens cast all your cares if you have a care tonight I want you to think of this thing that is overburdening you and say father I'm going to give it to you tonight because this thing is crushing me and he'll take care of it [Music] let's just bow our heads for just a moment father I feel very moved I feel very moved sometimes it's a still Small Voice sometimes it's not yelling at the people it's not telling them what they need to do but maybe what you're doing right now is your talking to somebody maybe has it hasn't been doing what they should do and they're really hurting [Music] father God is asking how you doing son how you doing sis and you can tell him right now I'm not doing very well I'm hurting man [Music] I'm all cut up inside I'm nervous I've got anxiety I have a hard time sleeping at night because you know what so much going on around me and father you forgive me that I've been too busy [Music] I've been too busy to spend time with you if that's you just raise your hand I don't need I don't need to see your hand he does he needs to see you be honest and see Lord I've been too busy I've been spending too much time other things and he's asking you right now be honest because he wants to spend time he wants to walk with you he wants to talk to you he wants to put his arms of Love around you and he wants to whisper in your ear the very secrets of life and he wants to give you joy unspeakable and full of Glory and if you don't feel the joy of your salvation then ask God God come by give me songs in the mornings songs in the night father give me a zip in my step and a joy in my heart that I wake up in the morning and I smell the roses I feel the Sunshine and I enjoy life father you are life and I thank you Lord I Thank you for being my God my savior I thank you that you love me for the Bible says while we were yet sinners Christ died for us [Music] you know what I'm going through you know what each one is going through right now and God is mindful of each one of you [Music] so I want you right now whatever is plaguing you whatever is giving you a hard time I want you to say father I can't handle this I've tried and I need your help [Music] father I commit these people and each one of their needs physical spiritual mental psychological it doesn't matter whatever is plaguing them whatever is keeping them from having the joy of the Lord I pray Lord that you will revealed to them something that tomorrow when they wake up Lord It's a Brand New Day that his mercies are new every day and I pray that heavenly father that when some of these will go to pray tomorrow morning that they won't pray like they've normally prayed and have this wish list and want list and to-do list and father do this and bless this and bless that and watch over me but may their prayer change by how much do they love you and thank you for all the many blessings [Music] and maybe not even ask you for one thing but praise you for all things father thank you for allowing us tonight to come into thy presence forgive me Father if I seem to bounce around but you know sometimes Lord I know that you do that for a purpose and maybe tonight you took me away from my notes to talk to somebody in their heart I thank you Father I commit this service unto you use it for your glory in Jesus Christ's name [Music] amen amen amen let's Stand Together more of you more of you [Music] I've had it all on what I mean thank you of things I've had my field yeah [Music] Lord hear my prayer for more [Music] thank you oh yes if you want more there's more of him more of you tell him [Music] I just need more of you of things [Music] [Applause] [Music] empty and bear Lord hear my prayer foreign [Music] Lord if we're asking for more of you there is more of you to give to us and we have poured out our lives before you we become very honest and I pray heavenly father that tomorrow morning when the different ones that have been here tonight maybe those at home who were streaming maybe those who archive this service maybe they'll realize they they haven't been in that special place they've lost that they've lost that first love [Music] do you see it in the cares of Life of just wore us down to where we never smell the the Roses anymore we never take time to meditate and wait upon you we never sit in your presence and just be still and know that you're gone father I pray take this sermon now break it down to the hearts of your people and father during these Services anniversary meeting I'm asking for a real move of God a revealing of the word a ministering of the Holy Spirit to every heart people taking time to commit and come and be prepared and have prayer time before they come that they'll be ready and prepared for
