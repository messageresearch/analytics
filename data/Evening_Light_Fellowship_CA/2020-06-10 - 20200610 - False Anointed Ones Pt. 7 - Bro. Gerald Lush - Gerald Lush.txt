hallelujah hallelujah thank you thank thank you [Applause] J for the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you [Music] [Applause] heart thank amen praise the name of the Lord amen amen I got brother Matthew's attention amen he's paying attention so I pray the Lord give us all that attention by the grace of God so the Lord bless you and it's again it's uh oh it's amazing that we have so many here amen as brother Bob said they're all on one side but well we trust that that it's is representing our stand for the gospel amen we're not divided we're we're United by the grace of God so it's amazing that we have so many here it's usually five or 10 but now we I think we're allowed 20 amen so I trust soon that we will be allowed all the rest as well to come because uh we we have something like 30 or 30 OD or more here in uh in St John's and again there's there's a number online of course outside the city and it's amazing too not just in not just in Newland there are those outside the province outside Newland that are that are watching our service so we thank the Lord for that and I bring uh greetings from Brother Mondo he called today and and also brother John kades and uh Brother Martin Warner and I believe it was today that I spoke to all three of them amen so I thank the Lord for that and uh brother Manda wanted me to send his greetings to all the saints here and uh that he's in prayer for us and it's been a while since he's been in church up there uh because of what's going on in Canada and uh well really it's around the world because according to our brother John Kadesh this is also influencing the churches in in Africa and in the condo of course where his his father pastors the church but again practically all the churches are closed in the condo and uh and also uh the churches there on Congo and uh the churches are are rather uh yeah churches are closed in in Ghana and and you Uganda and other parts of Africa as well I've had email from uh some of the Brethren there and it's it's it's striking them hard when they consider you know that they're not not not allowed to get together and sometimes they will try to get together maybe in a home for a cottage meeting so we pray the grace of God be with the Saints around the world Amen so uh it's it's I trust listen it's not easy and it's not easy for the ministry so I trust it's not easy for the Believers as well you know that you you feel the pressure you feel the dist stress of being kept out of church and not not not allowed to to get together as the scriptures forsake not the Assembly of yourselves together don't forsake it but there are a lot of believers who have forsaken it and there's going to be more believers who will forsake it but I trust we're numbered with those who who want that we're going to be numbered with those who who Jesus is looking for when he comes those amen those that he has gathered together in his name and that he is in he is in the midst by the grace of God so again the grace of God to our brother Mondo and to his family in Ontario and Au brother John Kadesh of course right now he's living in Quebec but he's right on the border with Ontario and near near hotal because that's where he is I think where he works usually is in Ottawa and where his uh education is is in Ottawa but of course because of what's going on he's he's not involved with any of that right now so we pray the grace of God to Brother John Kadesh and he also he sends his greetings to the Saints here amen and of course there are times when he feels that he wish he was back in Newland but again it might be another few months now because of what's going on before that he'll be able to get back to newf land so God bless brother John Kadesh and brother martin Warner he called twice I didn't get his first call but the uh but the second time I talk he called again so I I returned his call and uh he wants to send his greetings to the Saints here and he wanted to thank me for what we ministered on during the last service on Sunday and he said brother he said that was good and he said I was blessed he said and and he found that it was spirit spiritual food for him he said I really appreciated it so he said thank you brother and he highlighted a number of things that I had brought out and I that I had mentioned he said good he said that was a blessing and so he said thank you brother and he said of course he's with brother Jerry Fury in Ontario or in in Alberta rather and uh he does minister at times for brother Jerry and the Lord willing he'll be ministering for brother Jerry on Sunday so we pray God bless our brother martin Warner amen and uh he would like he said to be able to make a trip to Newland sometime and there is a apparently a couple that did visit here some years ago and I understood they stayed with our brother Matthew sister Amberg and man and his wife and uh they had told Brother Martin about their trip to Newland and apparently they're in the same church and uh that if they come to new land again brother martin is open that him and his wife can come with him amen and fellowship with us amen so God bless those saints that are viewing Us online or going going maybe on YouTube to listen to it so so God bless brother Mondo God bless our brother John mades and our brother martin Warner and also of course to remember in prayer the others that uh that maybe be might view Us online and that's our brother Alec Kar of course in Nova Scotia and also our brother ank and sister Verna in Bishop Falls brother Doug sister Beverly they they do attempt to try to tune in to Us online so God bless them in Western New land and also there are time when our brother stride uh in bought with are often bought with there uh that e katun in so it's amazing and the number of people that we are ministering to and that are tuning in to hear the word of the Lord so God bless them wherever they are and we pray the grace of God also to our brother back Samson and in Bishop Falls and sister drover and of course don't forget the other Saints uh brother stride and our brother Ellsworth and his wife sister Ellsworth so God bless them there's like I said there's a number of saints outside the city that are supporting the ministry here supporting the the the assembly here so I pray God continue to bless them and feed their souls with the bread of life amen so the Lord bless you amen let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe amen only be only be all things are possible

praise the Lord now I believe now I believe now I believe all things are possible now I believe now I believe now I all things are possible now [Music] I amen praise the Lord God bless you let's turn to the scripture that we finished with during the last service I believe it was Revelation chapter 16 and also to pray the grace of God to the family of George Floyd the gentleman that was killed just a few days ago in Minneapolis so it's amazing what is death has caused around the world Amen it's amazing what the what the other things are are going on around the world and that shut down everything a few weeks ago and now a few days ago this life is taken this individual is killed and it's affected the and affecting the whole world Amen yes it's amazing and I believe again understand this now saints that that it well this happen and that happened yeah but it's all for a reason and as I said why did God permit all of this to happen around the world and uh a few weeks ago well it's for a reason and uh again why is God permitting this to happen concerning concerning the the the the effect of of George Floyd being killed and being murdered so brother we we know it's for a reason and we we and it's God God I tell you God's looking at the at our our expression and and the reflection in our lives and God's looking at what's going on out there in the world how were we reacting to it how is the world reacting to it brother we're not to react the same as the world is reacting sure we'll pray the grace of God and and the mercy of God to his family that are no doubt mourning the loss and mourning what happened to this gentleman but again we know that when it has a worldwide effect surely somewhere God knew that it was going to happen and God permitted it to happen amen so it's for a reason considering the the the last days we are living in the last days so brother it's going to be in the Bible the Bible tells us what we're what the world is going to be experiencing in the last days and it's again it's in the scripture that brother bam brother Brown used his text for the message on the anointed ones at the end time and he and he took his text from Matthew 24 concerning the false Christ and the false prophets but also in in scripture it says concerning what's going to happen and happen and going on and going on and leading down to the end of all things it says all these are the beginning of Sorrows so what's going on in the world now and and no doubt maybe other things that may happen it's all going to be the as it were the beginning of Sorrows but somewhere in the midst of all of that God is going to resurrect and Rapture is is bright amen and we're going to be caught away into Eternity for the marriage supper of the Lamb we might be taken as as physical marriage spiritual marriage supper now and there's many that feel that that's what we're doing there there's many Believers that that are that are preaching that this is the marriage supper of the Lamb the re the revelation of the word the message of the hour well brother I believe that we're going to go to a real real meal with Jesus amen we're going to sit with him at not just in his throne but sit with him at the table by the grace of almighty God God Amen and again as I said that I was in a home somewhere one time and somebody highlighted the fact that uh they saw me get up and I was leaving or doing something and I was focusing on a picture that was on the wall in that house and it was a picture of Jesus sitting at the table and and and with with with the bride with all these Believers and they were eaing and I said well praise the Lord we're going to have a wonderful time H yeah and a brother that was there he went he went and began to spread the word oh you don't you don't know this but brother jural believes there's going to be a real marriage supper yeah he said because he said in the house he said he was looking at the picture of the marriage supper and and he and he said he praise the Lord for it and and oh yeah they started to spread this word around brother jural agrees with that brother jural believes that they didn't believe it they didn't believe in in they believe that we are having a marriage supper now in the hearing of the word but be honest with you the brother that that that spread that around he doesn't believe the message anymore so he's not eating he's not eating the word spiritually he won't be there physically amen so I pray the grace of God to help us brother amen let's believe brother when and God lays lays this out lays that out to get us to look look then and don't look this way don't look that way you just keep your keep your eyes on the promise keep your heart on the promise amen keep looking for the Fulfillment of that word by the grace of almighty God Amen so the Lord help us is my prayer as we get into the word and brother when we see all this happening and there a time of sorrow and everything is coming upon the earth oh brother I pray that we're not going to get caught up with that we're going to get caught up with what God has done not what what he's allowing the enemy to do and the devil out there amen cuz Satan is come down with great wrath knowing his time is short so God's going to let him do a lot of things but again he he can't do he can only do what God will allow him to do and God will per permit this for a reason that for a reason and like I said what's going on now is it well is it God or is it the devil well is God is over over it all and God can stop it God can Ender it God can God can just do this and not let it happen at all but God he permits this and he permits that so there's nothing that the devil can do without God's permission amen so brother God permitted him to do what he did in the Garden of Eden amen KN only that God permitted him to do what he did before time and we'll get into that scripture amen concerning what a God allowed in eternity and again we'll understand amen that the anointed ones is not is not just here the anointing on is not just in in the last days but brother brah is violating that that spirit in the last days he said now he said I want to talk about the anointed ones at the end time right but again whether there anointed ones from eternity down true time amen and on back to Eternity that's right by the grace of almighty God and we'll show you according to the scriptures amen that God permitted this to begin in eternity God allowed it to begin in eternity God said well he said I I created this and I created that he said so God is taking the responsibility for it exactly because he's God because he's God Amen and he is all knowing and brother God knew this was going to happen God knew that was going to happen brother there's nothing hid from him there are things that are HID from the devil and there's things that are HID from the seat of from the devil's seat and sometimes God hides things from it from his own seat and he reveal to him just what he wants them to believe just what he wants them to know amen because if God revealed everything about himself to us in in this in the flesh that we are in there's a lot of things we wouldn't understand that's true my ways he said are not your ways my thoughts are not your thoughts as I as the heaven is above the Earth so are my ways and my thoughts above yours amen because why because we've been born in sin and shaped in iniquity as it were amen amen but brother when we get back to Eternity there's things that that we don't know now that we'll know then things that we don't realize now will realize then amen because we're getting back into into our godship amen because Sons and Daughters of God are gods amen proba of God said don't you know that he said if if you're a Son of God you're a God Amen you're you're you're a daughter of God you're a God so brother God help us to to have realize and have the revelation of who we are amen let's be careful oh brother let's me let me ask you a question and when he got the Holy Ghost and brother what evidence do you have that you got the Holy Ghost how do you know that you got the Holy Ghost amen come on you you you ought to have the evidence you ought to have the oh yeah oh I got no worries Lord I Thank you for giving me the Holy Ghost I thank you not because you're giving me the Holy Ghost but I thank you for baptizing me with the Holy Ghost because why it's the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ in you the whole of Glory so how do you know you got Christ in you how you know you got the Holy Ghost In You amen I've tried to explain it something about see something in your heart something on the inside of the inside something in your soul Amen brother like I said it's getting to a place where one time we would feel the anointing in the atmosphere in a church we feel especially in a church but you also feel the anointing even even outside the church you feel the anointing when you when you walk here you go there you go somewhere else you feel that anointing but now it's got to the place where you where I don't feel the anointing in the atmosphere like I felt no of years ago no not by any means what I the atmosphere that was there when I was just just a young boy or the atmosphere that was there when I was a teenager the atmosphere was there when I first came to the message brother that that atmosphere is not there no more no not by any ma brother it's it's it's in me but it's not out there it is in the bride but it's not out there one time brother that anointing was was so powerful brother and so much in control of the bride and there were so many Believers brother that that when wherever you went you felt the power of God you felt the presence of God you felt the anointing of God and brother you could go into a believer's home and on one the anointing was there oh yeah you said praise the Lord Allelujah thank you Jesus for your presence amen we couldn't forget him we couldn't ignore him amen but the atmosphere is so bad now Amen brother that that is very there very very very few that are spiritual amen oh I pray God help us that we be spiritually minded amen by the grace of almighty God and as evidence of what's on the inside of the inside amen so what evidence do you have that's up to you you you can look in the mirror of of the word of God and say well I believe I got the Holy Ghost because this because of this because not just say I believe the message or I see this or I see that because the devil sees it oh yeah and the devil knows that it's the message he knows that it's the word but brother you got to you got to have that confirmation in your heart and in your soul believest thou this but in your heart amen not in your head there's too many with it in their heads but how do you know you got the Holy Ghost I pray you got the confirmation in your heart amen you feel that burning in your soul amen it's not out there in the atmosphere but it now it's narrowing down narrowing down to just in the bride not not just in the bride and out around the bride amen because why because the anointing was there and there were a lot more people with with the anointing and wherever they went oh that anointing was there oh yeah like I said I've gone into homes and felt the anointing I met Believers and I felt the anointing amen around them and so on it it was in them and around them but now it's getting fewer and fewer and fewer amen so the grace of God be with us brother and sister help us amen we need the help of God we what I tell you it's coming down to Faith amen oh I feel this I know got nothing to do what you feel now it's what you believe and believe it in your heart and in your soul amen not only that it controls you amen and you're living it out by the grace of God don't tell me show me amen and God is goddess wants the same thing don't tell me oh I believe this show me you what you believe God knows whether it's in your heart or in your head there's too many got in their heads and that's why we don't feel that anointing as I said in the atmosphere like we did it's and like the prophet of God said when he comes he said he said he he might get get a few here and a few there oh I believe that Believers are getting fewer and fewer and fewer I mean true Holy Ghost Believers amen don't ignore what Luther had don't ignore what Wesley had or the Pentecostals amen because God wants all of that plus what he's done in this hour for the bride the crown brother he's going to Crown he's going to Crown those that got Luther Wesley Pentecost and the others he going to oh yeah they get the crown Hallelujah as the bride of Christ grace of God to us brother it is serious amen so let's read in Revelation chapter 16 again being led by the spirit to say what he wants me to say and thank God that Believers have been blessed online with certain Revelations that God has brought out but in Revelation chapter 16 and verse 12 and the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared amen and I saw three unclean spirits like fogs come out of the mouth of the Dragon God permitting it for a reason and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet amen God permitting the true prophet and God permitting false prophets to rise on the scene just think they are they they profess to be prophets but there there is a true prophet and then there are false prophets and it says for they are the spirits of devils Grace that we're not under the spirit of a devil but under the spirit of God not under the spirit of the devil but we're under the spirit of Jesus Amen but he said these here the false prophets the Beast the dragon amen the unclean spirits he said they are the spirits of devils but look working miracles no one of the prophets highlighted concerning the anointed ones at the end time false Christ he said false anointed ones but they're true anointed ones but he said with false teaching yeah God help us don't don't go by the anointing go by the teaching amen are they staying with the word are they encouraging you to stay with the word are they laying out the word to get you to line up with this line up with that amen it's not to get you excited and emotional oh we believe the message We Believe there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a Rapture that's good but we got to have the experience in US amen the resurrection I have been resurrected and I've been raptured amen again how how many can say yeah I've been resurrected brother I've been res you have the Quicken you as he resurrected you were dead in sins amen but now he's resurrected you amen you were dead now you're living and he brought you out of the sin so the sin doesn't control you it's still in your flesh but don't control you amen and now you've been cut up into a Heavenly place in Christ Amen brother and again what's going on in Heavenly places he said that's where the word's revealed praise the Lord and why why why is that it is to give us more faith it is to give us a greater Faith amen so that we want to keep pressing on press on press on until the rapture we look up your Redemption Draw N amen that's the hour We're living brother if there ever an hour that we need to be more that we will the bride will be spiritual not religious the bride's going to be spiritual every now that you're going to not focus on the Natural Things of life you're focusing on the spiritual but the devil is there to get your attention away from the spiritual on the natural to get you to focus more and more and more and more on the Natural Things of life and God has get there to get you to focus on the spiritual amen God El us brother so that we're going to focus less and less and less on the spiritual oh I want this and I want that I got to do this and I got to do that no you don't Amen brother I mean it's going to like I said one brother said years ago in a tape might be in the basement here somewhere as I said he and I agree with him and he said the greatest lies told are told in church oh yeah they are greatest lies told and he said why he said t he mentioned that when he's tender A colleage why should I care he said the billing a mansion for me over there but he said most people don't that's not the truth because they don't want they're not satisfied with a Tor a colleage no they want more than that I tell you if your attitude is right your spirit is right if you are satisfied with a Tac College God will bless you with something better amen but there are those that'll move all that aside and they'll focus more on that than on the on the new new creature in Christ amen than on their spirit spiritual creation but if your focus is on your spiritual more and more and more and you're not going to focus on the natural then brother God God will bless you with something greater Bo because he knows that it's not going to affect you it's not going to take your attention you're not going to get caught out with that you're still being caught up with the word amen you're you're really in a rapturing faith amen and God will bless you with this amen no matter how much God blesses you with no no you won't get caught up with it it's not going to distract you from the Rapture it w't distract you from what God is doing amen Grace brother I'll let you sit down in a moment but as I heard a brother preacher said one time listen he said I I I've been preaching I've been standing here for so long and he said you've been only standing for a short while so he said I'll let you sit down eventually amen there's a brother from the states somewhere I believe amen so brother we see all these Spirits working and he said and again as I said there devils working miracles he said which go forth onto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of the great day of God Almighty concerning the battle of Armageddon I trust we're not going to be here for that no not by any means if we I trust if we see it we're going to come down with him at the end of it amen the old I come he said as a thief and blessed is he that WTH and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame amen and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon God bless his word you may be seated amen so praying the grace of God concerning the anointed ones in the in the last days and brother as he been F focusing on it in Matthew chapter 24 and brother it's it's prophesied again I believe it might be highlighted in Thessalonians and now in the Book of Revelation concerning the last days brother the false anointed ones and you're going to and it says these are the spirits like like frogs out of the mouth of a dragon he said of the mouth of a beast and out of the mouth of a false prophet oh we're going to we're going to recognize unclean spirits and we're going to recognize oh yeah the dragons and the beasts but what about the false prophets amen because according to what the prophet of God brings out here he said the false prophets he said are going to be under the anointing of a true Prophet as well but he said the only difference he said is their teaching and he said the false prophet is going the true Prophet staying with the word and he is iighting the word the word of God the word of God and the whole truth and nothing but the truth but he a false prophet he say it's going to add a word here and take away a word amen and he said yet he said he is he is identified in the word he is identified by the scriptures as being a prophet a amen as an anointed one amen and they are anointed and brother we've and I've experienced down through the years Ministries that have been anointed but brother it's not yeah it's a true anointing and is the anointing of God because why it is God anointing his word but again what what it is is that when when God is is is putting the word in the en is there to influence and add a word and the enemy is there to influence and take away a word amen yes that is the truth and yet but God is permitting it for a reason God is permitting it because he's going to bring out the seed of God and he's going to manifest the the seed of the serpent oh yeah because again there is a truth there and they're and they're both feeding on the word as it was in the Garden of Eden God has said and then again the enemy comes in and the serpent seed comes in and says yeah God said but so he's they're going to they're going to stay with the word as a word but add a word and they'll stay with a word and take away a word amen but they're under a false anointing not a false anointing no a true anointing but a false teaching amen because it was through the true anointing that they got the word the true anointing that they know what God has said amen but it's the enemy comes in with a false teaching to get them to add a word or take away a word Amen brother that's exactly what the enemy was using in the Book of Genesis and I tell you this we can go back to Eternity and we'll find out that the enemy was in eternity amen and brother he was injecting his thoughts Amen to well yeah he was an angel but again the the enemy that angel was injecting his thoughts to the other Angels amen and brother to the to the effect that to the effect that that he influenced thousands of angels so that when he was cast out those angels went with him and amen just think of that oh my brother sister oh my what an hour that there is a deception of angels amen out there in the presence of almighty God are there in the presence of Elohim amen that he was the one that created all things he was the one that created the Angels amen and I don't know how many may be thousands or millions of years that they might have been there amen Experiencing God Amen and then find that the devil's influence was going to influence those angels amen and when then when when he was cast out brother and sister tell listen those angels were cast out with them oh my God have mercy on us Lord have mercy on us that we're not going to be deceived brother it was that close oh it said no wonder he said so close would deceive the very elect if possible amen so close that it was in heaven so close that it that it deceived the Angels amen man brother if the if all those angels were deceived brother what about the word what about the the the the the the human being that God created on the earth and put in flesh amen and brother the angels are up here but man is down here amen and brother the only way you're not going to be deceived is you'd have to be the true seed of God Amen you have absolutely have the seat of God in your soul the seat of God on the inside of the inside in Your Heart by the grace of God Amen Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee amen because why because that's where the seed is it's in the heart amen we amen so can you say that I'm born again because I'm a new creature in my heart amen and I believe the word and I believe the whole truth nothing but the truth and I'm not going to head to it I'm not going to take from it and I'm not going to weaken the word amen by make an excuse excuse for this excuse for that amen many are are going to weaken the word by making excuses for the weakness of their flesh amen the weakness of their thoughts the weakness of their brain the weakness of of this these feelings amen no no if you're the seat of God brother you're going to stay with the word it is written it is written th thus sayth the Lord amen just the same as our lord Jesus when he was tempted to to to to compromise the word tempted to do this tempted to do that oh don't do this don't do that he said get the beyond me Satan amen because he knew that Satan was there to prevent the the word being made flesh and Satan is here to prevent the word for this hour for this age being made flesh in you and me amen that what God wants to do in US brother Satan is there to prevent that God Satan knows what's going on because the Bible says he has come down knowing his time is short so and if he knows his time is short then he he sees what God is doing I pray Grace that we're seeing what God is doing I pray Grace said we got a greater Revelation than the devil concerning what God is doing amen and brother what God is doing is doing in his seed what God is doing he's doing in his sons and daughters and the enemy is there and he's looking down and he knows who's the seat of God he knows who you are amen he knows he knows what whether it's in your head or whether it's in your heart amen and brother he's not really interested in those that got it in their heads he'll just he'll just deceive them more and more and more but hading more taken away more from the truth what for it weakens and weakens and weakens Faith amen but the True Believers there is oh my he's under the anointing of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord hallelujah amen but it's in his heart not in his head it's in the anointing of the Holy Ghost in the heart but not in our flesh amen and yet there are those that got the anointing but it's in their flesh got the anointing but it's in their heads but the bride is the elect of God the seed of God has got the anointing in their souls Amen brother I pray the grace of God help us to to recognize that and beond our Guard we're not going to let the devil deceive us no brother if we got the anointing in our souls we're going to be there and we're going to do as as the word did in flesh 2,000 years ago when the enemy came in in this person and the enemy came in that person trying to deceive Jesus trying to persuade Jesus don't do this don't do that no oh was the enemy tried and if he tried in Jesus he's going to try in you and me amen amen amen to get what for to divert us from what God is doing to divert us from what God wants to do in you what God wants to do in me what God wants to preach in you and me amen what God wants to make flesh in you and me amen we was Redemption of our souls as it were in Jesus now it's it's Jesus in us and it's the Redemption of our bodies oh well well brother said God praise the Lord Brother never heard it before amen it comes to redemption in our souls redemption in our bodies amen well brother he redeemed us in our souls and that's why he said I I I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age because at the end it's going to redeem our bodies amen because we are yet in in in in in sinful bodies born in sin amen shaved in iniquity come to the world as it were speaking lies the prophet said but denying this and denying that but through the baptism of the Holy Ghost We Believe amen and the enemy is still there in our minds to try to get us to disbelief the enemy is in our minds to get us to doubt amen but brother no matter what the enemy will say No Matter What feelings they give you you're going to come back as Jesus came back and said get thee Bey me Satan it is written amen thus said the Lord amen we're not going by feelings Jesus wasn't going by feelings he was going by faith amen if he was going by feelings he would have maybe listened to Peter and not went to Jerusalem if he was going by feelings and our faith he would have avoided Jerusalem and just did this and just did that amen but no he knew that he had to do it to redeem us right he had to do it to bring us back into Fellowship as Sons and Daughters of God by the grace of God Amen he had to lay down his life he had to experience it he had to suffer amen for you and me oh yeah and brother I tell you he suffered a lot more than we we'll suffer oh yeah he suffer right because of what of the powers and the anointings and the spirits that he was dealing with amen oh we're dealing with the devil we're dealing with this oh yeah but brother's nothing compared to what Jesus dealt with and all the demons he was dealing with all the spirits that he was dealing with amen not only that Jesus being the word of God in flesh he was more conscious of the devil maybe than we are more conscious of those demons than we are oh yeah his presence with with me and his presence in US brother is making us conscious of evil spirits and we know there's a negative Spirit out there a negative Spirit there oh that's contrary to the word that's contrary to the word yeah but brother I tell you Jesus was the word made F he was the fullness of the godhe B amen and and what what were the fullness of the God not as individuals but as the body of Christ amen as the body of the Bride the fullness of the god body of the bridegroom is in the bride amen by the grace of God so God help us whether that we're going to we're going to stay with the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth and don't add to it don't take from it don't let the de devil deceive you in in in the saying well that's all right that's all right the Lord won't mind this the Lord won't mind that listen stay I tell you what God Al mind God mind us if we're going to question the word god mind us if we're going to add to the word or take away from the word god minded if we're going to let the devil influence us not to put too much emphasis on this not to put too much emphasis on that oh yeah and there's a lot of Believers feel that oh we don't have we don't have to be that that strict we don't have to be that that straight and so on well our strict was God in Garden of Eden o was God in Christ ohri was Christ in in in in in apping his word amen and in preaching the word the whole truth nothing but the truth Amen brother he was strict and then that's why that's why that the the disciples they they couldn't follow him they they couldn't identify with all that he was doing and so but brother he stayed with the word amen and he laid down his life and you stay with the word you lay down your life amen so that it's not you that lives it's Christ that lives in you amen that's tremendous is Christ Living in you in your house is Christ Living in you in your job is Christ Living in you in in in your school or in in your education is Christ Living in you regardless of what you're doing where you do it now you do it amen amen so oh praise the Lord so

it'll deceive the Unholy ghost oh yeah God help us make sure that the spirit you got on you and the spirit you got in you is the Holy Ghost amen not a covering cherub that was put out of Heaven oh yeah no wonder he can deceive the people to go out there and and and and declare himself to be this declare himself to be that oh yeah no wonder he deceived Eve yeah and he came down and Anointed The Serpent the serpent came over just saying and the word that the serpent used the devil gave him oh yeah it wasn't the serpent just just just saying what he what he what he felt or what he knew it was what what Satan had revealed to him and he said yeath God said Thou shalt surely die yeah yeah he and he came back to Eve with the word he came back to Eve with thus sayith the Lord but he added a word and he said Thou shalt not surely die well God said Thou shalt surely die but they just he put in th not surely die yeah and not only that he and he tried to justify oh Eve you should do this and you should do that because listen you shall be as Gods what oh yes you'll know this and you'll know that oh brother the devil is there to tempt people with Revelation amen do this do this and you'll know this you'll see this you'll hear this amen oh you'll say oh listen to this preacher listen listen to that preacher listen to this one listen to that one be careful sometime whether it's in church or whether it's online oh yeah as I said that that that internet it's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil oh yeah and thou shalt not eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil what there's good on it but don't be deceived amen and influenced by the evil amen deceived into thinking this is good this good yeah but there there's that word there not not inot Thou shalt not surely die oh amazing God said Thou shalt surely die and the enemy comes in and he gives him 99% of the word but then he puts in a 1% one word amen and around the message that brother I tell you this God has given us the word God has given us the truth it is written thus sayth the Lord but the enemy is there oh yes God has yes it's written but yeah thus said the Lord but yeah oh yes this this yeah yeah and he's adding to the word and this is why that we're seeing so many socalled Believers today oh yeah but they're but not they're not living like the oldtime Believers lived they're not taking their stand like the old fashioned Believers did no not by any means they're not man they're not manifesting the character of the old fashioned believer I pray God help us that we won't compromise amen but the character that he lived out in them you'll live out in you and brother it wasn't this brother's character this sister's character it was the character of Jesus it was the life of Jesus Amen it was the love of Jesus Oh The Grace of Jesus Amen that that brother and sister if they got Christ in them the hope of glory then the brother they got is is attributes amen you got the attributes of Christ in you amen and it's there for family friends and neighbors as I said just put it in the hands of God and and move on Amen and again the one of the Brethren I was talking to oh brother thank you thank you for bringing out that concerning you know keep your attitude right to those out there keep your attitude right to them amen God has brought us out as the bride but brother they're not bride but that don't mean they're not saved oh brother and yet their Believers think oh we're just Believers we're Believers and they're going to hell and we're going to heaven no you got that attitude you're going to hell and they're going to heaven amen don't don't have that attitude brother because why we we believe that God has called us out yes amen but why why is he celebrating us to that extent because we're bride and I said to bride's going to sit with him in his throne the bride's going to sit with the married supper of the Lamb amen but the others I said she's in the city but the others are outside the city oh wonderful he said brother oh thank you praise the Lord he said brother that encourages me because he said some years ago he said I had this I took this stand and I took that stand and and I was wondered about this one and wondered about that one oh and he felt bad about this one or that one if if he felt that they were going to go to hell or didn't believe the message I said no brother they're not going to hell I said keep your attitude right keep your spirit right because they could be outside the city oh wonderful Hallelujah he said praise the Lord he so they'll come into the City and meet me I said yes I said then they'll go again so brother keep your at as I said I told you and many times I when I first come to the message my first sermon was about that yeah because when I when I came from the message first I met so many Believers oh my they had they had such a self-righteous attitude and they look down their noses on everyone outside the message oh yeah they did oh yeah they condemn them because they went there condemn them because they went to that church or that church I said look be careful I said you better leave them I said because God says some of them are his children like that woman that brother Brown was condemning because oh he condemned the woman and he condemn this person because of the way they dress because of the way they were living and the angel said don't do that you can condemn and that that but don't condemn them because he says some of them are my children amen so brother let's keep our attitude right our Spirits right whether it's to family or friends or neighbors amen because some of them are God's children hallelujah oh that's encouraging oh it's encouraging he said brother because he had been under maybe sometimes you you hear Ministries and they're condemning anyone and everyone outside the message that's not right no no don't thank God for what he got you given you to be the bride but remember you're pleading the token for them and the prophet of God said he said as long as the bride is on the earth there's Grace amen Grace well what I experienced when I first come to this word and this message it wasn't Grace only have Grace to one another but they never had no and they didn't have Grace for everyone and but then but they had no Grace for those outside but you got to have Grace got to have Grace because again what God what he said to the prophet he's saying to you and me some of them are my children it might be somebody you're working with yeah never oh no wonder he said the prophet reminded us he said when you get there you're going to be surprised who made it and who didn't make it amen oh yeah you was surprised who made it to be the bride and who didn't make it you was surprised who who made it and who didn't make it for outside the city grace of God be with us brother keep if oh my grace brother as Jesus told the disciples concerning the scribes and Pharisees he said now he said do what they say but don't do as they do you should just just move on and leave them by the grace of God Amen so brother keep your attitude rate your spirit rate amen so brother understanding this too that we're experiencing the the the the dealing with the devil we're experiencing the anointing of the Holy Ghost with us and in us and trusting that he's got control of us in our souls make sure you're in this message because the message is in you and it's in your soul controlling you amen it's in your soul controlling your thoughts controlling your words controlling your days controlling your actions and reactions I don't care where it is not just in church and not just in your home but it's it's your whole life yeah morning noon and night no matter where you are no matter who you're dealing with you're going to be Jesus in flesh you're going to be the word and flesh you're going to have a right spirit and a right attitude by the grace of God or you'll take your stand for what's right or you will yeah but again you got to have a right spirit and right attitude you're not going to condemn this and condemn people you you condemn like the prophet like God told the prophet you can condemn what that woman is wearing but don't condemn her you can condemn what this one does and that one does don't do whatever but don't condemn them just pray the grace of God be with them amen so he's concerning the devil see Satan was in heaven he walked him down in the coals of fire but yet we know that somewhere somehow God permitted it God created him oh yeah and and and it brings out ear concerning concerning what what what struck Satan and while called Satan to do what he did oh yeah it was something that was in his heart and God permitted it that's why God in the New Birth brother he takes control of our hearts not our flesh not our minds but the heart from the inside out so what so that he can control us soul body and spirit amen so notice this was in heaven and brother when God created man he permitted it to come down to the Earth the enemy oh yeah God allowed it and God permitted it for a reason and sometimes he'll reveal what it why and other times he won't but brother it is to bring out what is it what war it is to bring out our faith that we believe God that we trust God and we love God because why we believe that regardless of what God permitted and what God allows it's all for a purpose and a reason that's right that's why God told us that's why God warned us that his thoughts are above ours and his ways are above ours cuz there are things that God would do there are things that God would permit amen that we would not understand but it will be a trial of our faith to believe God a tri of our faith that we're just trusting God Amen Lord we believe you and we believe your motive is right and your objective is right that whatever reason Lord that you're allowing this and allowing that we believe Lord you've got an eternal purpose amen amen a right motive a right objective amen Lord help us to go forth with that right motive and right objective hallelujah hallelujah and God is permitting it brother hallelujah what for God is not willing that any should perish see his attitude is right his spirit is right but he's not willing that any should perish so brother we're not willing that any should perish so we want to plead the token for family friends and neighbors oh yeah again be surprised who made it and who didn't make it keep your attitude right amen believe God I tell you anyone that don't make it it's just that their heart is against God Amen they're just going to be just totally don't not not into the truth I tell you if a person's heart is right and their attitude is right the spirit is right God's not going to kill kill them God's not going to send them away no God sees that God recognizes that he's not willing that any should perish so brother he'll honor that and and he and he allow them to come in oh yeah and he he'll give them a white robe the bride possesses a white robe yeah we got white robes from the inside out but they're going to be given white robes and that'll be that'll be the Judgment the prophet of God said that after the Great Tribulation there and after after the manal rain and he said he'll gather them all together and he said this one will come up and that one is gone to Hell CU why it's there spirit and their attitude yeah it's their spirit and their attitude in their hearts and there there are people that we meet sometimes and and sometimes we do know it sometime we don't know it and that is their spirit and their attitude and there are those they just don't have an attitude nothing they don't care about goodness or righteousness or anything like that nothing spiritual they're just caught up with the Natural Things of life and and and not not just in your heads but it's really a the spirit in their hearts if it's only in their heads God God knows what the heart is see God's looking at your heart yes your spirit your soul yeah and well of course he knows the bride is going to have a right attitude right spirit in in the heart and the soul and so on and and she just surrenders to the word but then there are others out there too they have a right attitude right Spirit oh yeah oh yeah so God God will honor them amen God knows God knows the heart God knows their thoughts God knows their motives and objectives he he sees their actions and their reactions amen but brother as the prophet of God said we can't get the truth he said to this message to everyone no he says this is only to the bride again trying to explain that to to Believers brother don't condemn those outside the message this is this is the calling of the Bride this is for the elect amen and brother it's not only the bride that's going to heaven the bride is going to be in the city but then there's going to be those outside the city amen there are those that are that are going to be witnessing the the the the the the union of the Bride the Heavenly brid and the Earthly bride they'll witness that amen but then they'll then they'll go back but after the great after the millennial Reign amen he's going to he's going to call them forth and give them white robes why because they respected him and they respected his bride he knows their heart oh yeah by the grace of God but just to remind you that the evil that we're dealing with come from eternity down through time but it goes back to Eternity but destroyed God created it God destroys it yeah oh what he's Eternal no no in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth God created angels amen or they say was only this is going to die no even angels come under the Judgment of God and not only that they were put out of Eternity and really they they came down from heaven and they got subject to time and it's going to go a long time they been thousands of years oh yeah but they're going to die they're going to go into and they'll have their part or their time in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone oh yes not not Eternal no no they'll have their time and and I thank our brother leil brought out some of those things concerning the original scripture he said people think he said they'll have their part in the Eternal fire and so on no he said they'll have their time in the lake that burth with fire and brimstone he how long it's going to be he said we don't know but he said he said after after a certain period of time he said they'll be gone they'll be totally G destroyed yeah and not only that then of course after the millennial Reign then God's going to give the the righteous of white robe and the others their heart was not right is there in I believe it Revelation 20 or 21 and he said you know cast him into the Lake of Fire oh yeah the others white Rob the other one Lake of Fire why God is looking at their hearts and their heart their spirit and their heart is not right God knows your spirit God knows your heart oh yeah and you get and and again unfortunately over the years I've met Believers their Spirit wasn't right and the No I said Lord their heart is not right because their attitude toward this one their attitude toward that one their attitude toward this that see oh my I'll tell you the the attribute of your spirit and your soul and your heart Grace Grace and yet there are those just going around with the word the message and condemning everybody condemning this one condemn thank God for the word that saves us amen amen that we believe the word amen and we just leave the others with the word and the grace of God Amen he said as long as the bride is here there's Grace so but there there are those that are just oh my got a wrong Spirit and the wrong attitude God help us brother if we got the Holy Ghost and we got Christ in us I tell you if there's anything you got any addage you got any Spirit you got is love oh yeah because why God is love cuz that's what God is love and yet you got so-called Believers oh there anything but love that's something they don't have is love they maybe want you to love them but they don't love you oh I tell you God is love that's the that's the as I said that's the only definition of God in the Bible God is divine love not natural love divine love amen if there's any any attitude you got toward your brothers or sisters in Christ toward others even those out there is love and it's divine love and you you can do what you want challenge it challenge it it's it don't change it it's love right yeah you still love them you're still there you're still there to help them amen as Christ is there to help you you're there to help them amen grace of God be with us so brother identifying Satan where he come from he said thou has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering and he highlights the stones and he said prepared in thee in the day that thou was created in verse 14 Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe and the prophet is preaching on the anointed ones at the end time and brother Satan was an anointed cherb amen and I have set thee thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created he was perfect until iniquity was bound in him amen and by the multitude of thy mercies or merchandise thou have filled the midst of thee with violence they have filled fill the midst of thee with violence amen and thou has sinned therefore will I cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy thee Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee amen Satan brother was lifted up with pride because of his Beauty amen and he became a seed of discrepancy in heaven and he was cast out and the angels with him amen and he became a seat of discrepancy in the Garden of Eden he became a seed of discrepancy all the way down through time even in this day in this hour wherein we are warned of false Christ and false prophets amen again Satan expressing the true anointing amen but a false teaching that's what he did in the Garden of Eden that's what he has done down through the down Through the Ages down through the prophets that's what he has done down through the church ages amen that he had amen that he had a true anointing but then there was a spirit in the church ages amen adding to what God had revealed taking away from what God had revealed making a denomination out of what God had done amen and again I don't have the time to get into the Book of Revelation Chapter 2 2 and three there showing you the spirit of the enemy Amen brother all my talk with the Church ages and brother than the church ages it was God oh yeah God was there that's the weight but then it was Satan's influence and that's what they put the black there for and we know that when the prophet of God was preaching this that the pillar of fire came into Brenham Tabernacle and it went over on the side of the church amen and it this is what it drew out oh yeah it what yeah the pillar of fire came in and Drew it out on the wall there and and the those that were there they could they could see it yeah but the prophet of God said notice this he said that one was absolutely black but he said I he said I put that little bit of weight there to represent the bride the bride age yeah he amen praise the Lord why because he said when the angel when the pillar of fire drew it he said it was total darkness be on our guard because we're going to be here until everything goes into total darkness we're going to be here until every most everybody on the Earth is going to go into the letter of the word but not the spirit there's going to be fewer and fewer and fewer that will have the Holy Ghost they'll have the letter of the message they'll be in the message but the message is not in them again this is what the prophet brings out in the anointed ones at the end time they're in the message they're experiencing the anointing but the teaching is false amen they got the anointing outward but not in the soul because that stays with the word and again brother as as somebody said if God told you to pick out the bride in this age he said what would you do he said I wouldn't want to do it it he said I might find a dozen what yeah I might find a dozen and again you go to that message how can I overcome and I believe I told you just second just the second page but no it's not the second page I think it's page 31 in the book and you just see what the prophets got to say there concerning Believers and what what they're doing and what and the Temptation that that that they are subject to the Temptation Of The Devil in these last days that's influencing them if the problem of God saw it about 50 years ago what would he see today exactly brother it'd be a lot worse yeah that's like he said if God asked me to pick out the bride and he said I doubt if I if I'll find a dozen what a dozen yeah and another time he said well yeah all due respect he said there might be a dozen he Out of Africa yeah maybe brother Joshua was numbered with them and that's why the Lord brought him here amen so he said it might be a dozen Out of Africa but if there's only a dozen Out of Africa there there's less out of Canada there's less out of America Grace of God be with us brother and help us it is serious so I pray Grace brother that we'll not ignore the Revelation that what we're experiencing began in heaven and brother it's all the way down through time yes at the gate that's leading us back into Glory the grace of God be with us amen bear with me and I'll finish my let's see I've read this before but as Peter said we're forgetful ears so God help us bring it to our remembrance and he read the scripture of Matthew chapter 24 and he said listen close while I reread this again oh never notice that he re he reread it no I'm going to reread it amen this again like I said this was in 1965 he said listen close he said while I reread this again yeah he said there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders brother we're going to be impressed by the word we thank God for the signs and wonders but what about the word that follows it amen in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now he said for a subject this morning I want to take the anointed ones at the end time and he said I believe that we are living in the end time and I think most anyone the scripture reader even a believer knows that we are now at the end of the history of the world well over 50 years ago yeah but that's nothing in the eyes of God if a year is a thousand or one or a day is a thousand years and so on with the Lord so we're at the end of the history of the world I believe we're at the end and you and I have been experiencing it yeah there will be no use of writing it because there won't be anybody to read it it's at the end of the time yeah and everything is getting so lack of spiritual or spirituality there's a little bit of religion but not much I think brother Mark brought out something about people don't know what Christian is or Christianity and so on yeah it's getting worse and worse and worse yeah that when he comes he won't find Christians Christlike the church like some of them and that's getting less and less and less oh yeah God help us to be Christlike are you Christlike in your home are you Christlike in your job or in your school yeah by the grace of God please that you reflect Jesus amen yeah it's not not necessarily being religious I remember one time that in the school I went to was religious school church school and I was late for the Bible class the religious religion class that's when the teacher there would teach you certain things from the Bible and I was late getting there and I walked in and sat down and the teacher and he's he's still alive today he I said he'd be in his 90s and uh and he said Mr Lush he said uh do you know he said that you'll be late for the Judgment because I was late for the class and everybody laughed and I said I hope so he said okay and then he read a scripture amazing and he asked a question he said what Church age are we living in I was surprised what but I wouldn't answer first and he said well nobody answered and he said raise your hand if you know so he answer he asked the question again two or three times and he said what church age are we in does anybody know so I was waiting for somebody else to answer to finally I rais my hand okay he said said Mr L she said what church age are we in I said I believe I said that we are in the loudest in church age yes he said you're right he said you're absolutely right he said let me read it and he read Revelation 3 yeah even they knew that back there amen so we'll give the glory to God oh yeah and again they they recognize me as being a Christian but not a denomination they knew that and not only that the teacher that same teacher felt that brother jural Lush was going to be a judge yeah he said cuz he asked a Bible question again in another class and he asked this one to answer what's your answer what's your answer what's your and several gave answers Some Gave no answers till he came to me Mr Lush what's your answer and I gave the answer just very brief and he said oh Mr Lush he said do you know he said you are going to be a judge I said I don't know but I am yeah because God is judging us by his word yeah that's going over the pulpit exactly why he judging your faith judging your nature your character is it in your heart or in your head that's what God's looking for amen you see we at the end of the history of the world and just when I do not know he should just how long it will be not even the angels of heaven knows that minute or hour but we been told by the Lord Jesus that when these things that we see now begin to come to pass then to lift up our heads for Redemption is drawing nigh now he said what drawing nigh means I do not know but it's drawing nigh and he said it's cracked all the way around concerning California and the prophecy that he made concerning California and he says cracked all the way around but he didn't know exactly when it was going to go under but we know the California is going down now because as I said before there are many in California that are putting up brick walls behind their houses because the water is rising and the water is not necessarily Rising it's California sinking yeah so the grace of God I pray that every elected predestinated seed will flee amen amen just bear with me he said there's an accumulation of evidence that the hour that we now live in I think it's good thing to rehearse these things and to draw them out since the seals has been open and find out the truth of these things as God has been so loyal to us with his grace to show us these things thank God for Grace you're still getting the word it's the grace of God to us I want you to notice here in Matthew 24 Jesus used the term Christ not Christ but plural Christ and he said therefore the word me Christ means the anointed one and he said if the anointed one there will be not only one but many anointed ones it's not a false Christ but a false false false Christ plural and there shall arise false anointed ones in the last days that seems almost impossible the terms anointed but notice the very next words and false prophets plural and the anointed one is one with a message and the only way the message can be brought out he said is by one that's anointed and he said that would be a prophet anointed but there shall arise false anointed teachers a prophet teaches what his message is he said anointed teachers but anointed people with false teaching he said anointed ones plural and he said it's a Sunday school lesson he said we want to try he said to bring this to a real Showdown by the scriptures not by what someone one else has said about it but just reading the scriptures you may say how can this be what were they Christ plural anointed Christ false prophets anointed ones but false prophets and Jesus said that the rain falls on the just and the unjust do you believe that the anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir he said the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon a person yet they are false yet they have a true anointing yeah but it's not in their hearts it's not in their soul they're experiencing the anointing and there's many a Believer experiences the anointing of the revealed word but it's not in their souls yeah they can line up intellectually but again eventually compromise a little here compromise a little there and still Proclaim they believe the message and again and now can I overcome page 31 the prophet is bringing out that spirit that he was dealing with in his own church oh yeah they were believing the message but now there was a spirit among them to compromise yeah and he said I'm going to preach it to you stop doing it amen well brother if if that was so then he would if he was still here today he'd be still preaching it but he'd be over 100 years old yeah God help us Isa the anointing one Isa that means the people means that it's anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir it is the genuine holy spirit of God upon a person and yet they are false now listen close and see what he said and they shall show signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they would deceive the very elected and he said they are anointed with this genuine Holy Spirit I know that sounds very foolish but we're going to take time and explain it by the word of God that it is absolutely thus sayeth the Lord the truth amen and the Lord willing we'll get more and more into it maybe the next service we'll see what the Lord will do but again he sends his Reign on the just and the unjust and he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good God help us let's make sure that we're in the truth in our heart hearts in our souls not intellectually in our heads where we're going to compromise a little here and compromise a little there we'll add a word take away a word well I believe it means this I believe it means that it means it the way God said it yeah don't add to it don't take from it and brother let's pay attention to the leadership of the Holy Ghost by the grace of God Amen God help us in this hour of anointed ones at the end time that we'll stay with the true anointing the true teaching not a false teaching amen it's not what we feel it's what's revealed and where it's revealed in our hearts grace of God be with us Lord bless you let's stand let sing
