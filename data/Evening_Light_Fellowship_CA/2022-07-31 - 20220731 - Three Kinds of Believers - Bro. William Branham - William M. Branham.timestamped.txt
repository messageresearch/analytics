[52:40] it
[52:41] oh
[52:42] okay brother
[52:45] amen
[52:46] praise the lord so the lord willing
[52:48] today uh
[52:51] not exactly knowing what i was going to
[52:52] minister on
[52:54] so the lord willing we're going to hear
[52:55] the prophet minister
[52:57] and it's uh
[52:59] it's a maybe a no doubt a tape or a book
[53:02] we've read or a tape we've heard a
[53:03] number of times
[53:05] because they ministered in 1963 november
[53:08] the 24th anybody know what that is
[53:11] that's today no they don't know amen but
[53:14] you know the message
[53:16] and it is three kinds of believers amen
[53:20] so we've heard that before and we've and
[53:22] i believe we've even heard the tape
[53:24] before it's been a while amen but let's
[53:27] hear it again
[53:28] because the closer we get even to the
[53:30] rapture we need to have this revelation
[53:33] we need to have this understanding that
[53:35] what we're dealing with the spirits
[53:37] we're dealing with amen is getting more
[53:39] and more and more deceiving that's true
[53:42] truth to the extent well it's to the
[53:44] extent where the scripture says when the
[53:47] son of man comes will he find faith on
[53:50] the earth amen it's going to get that
[53:52] bad even among oh well there's going to
[53:54] be a lot of believers believers
[53:57] yeah believing what but again brothers
[54:01] their denominations of this denomination
[54:03] that denomination they all profess to be
[54:05] believers and they're believing what god
[54:07] has revealed to to their founders maybe
[54:10] maybe 50 years ago 100 years ago 500
[54:13] years ago but they're believing this
[54:15] believing that but again brother sister
[54:18] we truly believe what god has revealed
[54:20] to us in these last days amen the
[54:23] prophet warned us and i believe it's the
[54:25] lord not just william branham but it's
[54:28] the lord in the ministry of the message
[54:30] three kinds of believers let's make sure
[54:33] that we are believers
[54:35] the true believers holy ghost believers
[54:38] that we are not make believers
[54:40] unbelievers but true believers
[54:42] and brother oh my what a deception if
[54:45] we're if we're make believers thinking
[54:47] we're believers
[54:49] that's the truth the problem of god said
[54:51] and and when it comes to these three he
[54:53] said they're in they're in the church
[54:57] uh in this church well i hope not
[55:00] i trust we're all believers
[55:02] but again the the bigger the crowd
[55:06] the more
[55:07] you get mixed
[55:08] amen the more there is when it comes to
[55:12] believers make believers unbelievers
[55:15] but there's going to be a greater number
[55:17] of make-believers and a greater number
[55:19] of unbelievers and a few believers
[55:23] because the scripture warns us
[55:25] concerning the few that's going to be
[55:27] true from faithful and that are going to
[55:29] be really ready for the resurrection
[55:31] really ready for the rapture in the last
[55:33] days
[55:34] again that's why he said when he comes
[55:36] will he find faith
[55:38] will he find real believers that are
[55:41] believing not in your head but believing
[55:44] in your heart
[55:45] i know i've already ministered on these
[55:46] things a number of times concerning
[55:48] those that believe up here when it comes
[55:51] to their head and those that believe in
[55:52] their flesh
[55:54] and their feelings but how many are
[55:55] believing in the heart the prophet of
[55:57] god again let me remind you he said you
[56:00] can have the holy ghost he said 24 hours
[56:03] a day and go to hell
[56:05] amen you can have the experience of the
[56:07] holy ghost in your head you can have the
[56:09] experience of the holy ghost in your
[56:11] flesh and go to hell but how many really
[56:13] got the holy ghost in their souls amen
[56:16] so that you can truly say it's not me
[56:19] that lives it's christ that lives in me
[56:22] amen not many can say that because most
[56:25] they're living themselves by their
[56:27] feelings others are living you know
[56:29] while i'm living by the word but it's
[56:30] intellectual and it's in there in their
[56:32] minds amen but not in their hearts
[56:36] oh i pray the grace of god let go let
[56:38] god have his way so lord brother sister
[56:40] so it's not you living the life that
[56:42] you're living is jesus living in you
[56:45] amen so the actions you have the
[56:47] reactions you have the thoughts you have
[56:49] it's jesus am god help us
[56:52] amen brother let go and let god have his
[56:55] way amen and because
[56:58] we need to make it our calling election
[57:01] sure and especially in these last days
[57:03] because we've been warned that it's
[57:05] going to be a deceiving hour
[57:07] we've been warned that it's going to be
[57:09] you know there's going to be very very
[57:11] very few true believers
[57:13] amen the vast majority of those
[57:16] attending church make believers or
[57:18] unbelievers unbelievers going to church
[57:22] probably god said they're all in church
[57:25] amen and again of course he warned us he
[57:27] said the first one in church is the
[57:29] devil
[57:30] amen and he's there he's there to
[57:32] influence your thoughts your feelings
[57:34] your emotions amen and he'll there
[57:36] you're there to give you these thoughts
[57:38] and make you believe that it's god but
[57:39] it's the devil
[57:41] oh yeah he's there to give you this
[57:42] feeling and make you believe that's god
[57:44] but it's the devil oh yes so brother
[57:46] sister we better be on our guard make
[57:49] your calling and your election sure
[57:52] amen what make sure that you're you're
[57:55] you're living by the word amen you're
[57:57] living in the word and more important
[57:59] the word is living in you
[58:02] amen praise the lord so it's it's not
[58:05] you doing this doing that it's jesus in
[58:07] you amen
[58:08] by the grace of almighty god
[58:10] so as we go into the message of the
[58:12] prophet today concerning three kinds of
[58:14] believers again
[58:16] we're being challenged
[58:18] to determine
[58:20] who are we
[58:21] are you a believer
[58:23] are you a make-believer
[58:25] are you an unbeliever
[58:28] and you mean to tell me they're around
[58:29] the message they're around the message
[58:31] because they'll believe this and they'll
[58:34] they'll believe god said a prophet but
[58:35] are they going to believe all that the
[58:37] prophet said
[58:39] that's right no
[58:40] they'll believe this they'll believe
[58:42] that but not this they'll put their
[58:44] interpretation of this amen brother
[58:46] leave it the way that god revealed it
[58:48] amen believe it the way that god
[58:50] revealed it amen it's god remember
[58:52] either god is doing anything for the
[58:54] message of the hour he is challenging
[58:56] our faith
[58:58] amen and the question is over and over
[59:01] again believeth thou this amen you hear
[59:05] the prophet or you read it in one of the
[59:07] books believers thou this
[59:09] brother and sometimes again the prophet
[59:11] warned us you can believe it
[59:13] intellectually and you can believe the
[59:14] letter of it but not the spirit of it oh
[59:17] yeah
[59:18] you're walking by the letter and but not
[59:21] by the spirit you're walking as it were
[59:23] intellectually by religion but not by
[59:25] the spiritual revelation of god
[59:28] brother god in control
[59:31] god in control of your thoughts god in
[59:33] control of your feelings god in control
[59:34] of you your actions and reactions oh yes
[59:38] so again i trust by grace that you could
[59:40] yeah you can really believe it really
[59:43] say it it's not me that lives no no the
[59:47] life i'm living no no that's not me
[59:49] that's jesus
[59:51] amen and i'm yielding more and more to
[59:53] jesus every day amen let go and let god
[59:57] have his way
[59:58] oh brother so brother when oh and he
[1:00:00] allowed this to happen in your life you
[1:00:02] allow this to cross your path this to to
[1:00:04] do this and that oh yeah what for to
[1:00:07] bring out
[1:00:08] the the anointing that's really on you
[1:00:11] bring up the anointing the life that's
[1:00:12] really in you is it christ in you or is
[1:00:15] it just religion or is it the devil
[1:00:18] oh yeah so brother are we the true not
[1:00:21] make believers
[1:00:22] not unbelievers but true holy ghost
[1:00:25] believers
[1:00:26] we believe
[1:00:28] god
[1:00:29] we believe the word amen and your and
[1:00:32] you'll go forth and live the life
[1:00:34] reflecting the word
[1:00:36] oh yeah amen
[1:00:38] they'll see that you're just not
[1:00:40] religious person you're spiritual
[1:00:43] amen you're you're you're not united or
[1:00:46] a church goer you're born again
[1:00:48] amen because there's too many brother
[1:00:50] sister
[1:00:52] that are religious but not spiritual
[1:00:55] very religious and they can think
[1:00:57] religiously and talk religiously but not
[1:01:00] spiritual
[1:01:02] so i pray the grace of god help us to be
[1:01:04] spiritual
[1:01:05] sons and daughters of god
[1:01:07] born
[1:01:08] again really truly born again amen

[1:01:15] absolutely got a new nature
[1:01:17] amen it's just not your thoughts it's
[1:01:20] your nature
[1:01:21] i tell you if anything proves your birth

[1:01:24] oh yeah because we can we can meet this
[1:01:27] one meet this one meet that one
[1:01:29] and we we want we judge them by their
[1:01:32] nature oh
[1:01:34] oh that's their father
[1:01:37] that's their mother
[1:01:38] why because they're acting like it
[1:01:40] they're talking like it oh yeah
[1:01:42] you wouldn't you're going to have the
[1:01:44] nature of your natural parents amen and
[1:01:46] natural family amen so if you're born
[1:01:48] again you're going to have the nature of
[1:01:50] your spiritual
[1:01:51] from the nature of god
[1:01:53] the nature of jesus this is absolutely a
[1:01:55] challenge
[1:01:56] so i pray god help us lord that we're
[1:01:59] going to judge ourselves by the word
[1:02:01] amen oh yeah
[1:02:03] my nature is not because i go to this
[1:02:05] church this is how they act in that
[1:02:06] church no no no

[1:10:07] amen
[1:10:12] praise the lord
[1:10:15] six let's begin now with the sixth
[1:10:17] chapter of saint john and beginning with
[1:10:19] the 60th verse
[1:10:22] many therefore of his disciples when
[1:10:26] they heard
[1:10:27] heard this said this is a hard saying
[1:10:32] who can hear it
[1:10:34] then jesus knew himself that his
[1:10:36] disciples murmured added
[1:10:39] and he said unto them does this
[1:10:42] offend thee
[1:10:45] what if ye shall see the son of man
[1:10:47] ascending up where he was before
[1:10:52] is
[1:10:53] is it the spirit that quicken
[1:10:56] and the flesh prophet that nothing
[1:10:58] that's right
[1:10:59] the words that i speak unto you
[1:11:02] they are spirit that's him
[1:11:06] and they are life
[1:11:09] what do you say i am the truth the life
[1:11:14] they are spirit
[1:11:16] they are life
[1:11:18] but there are some of you that believe
[1:11:20] not
[1:11:22] or jesus knew from the beginning who
[1:11:25] they were that believe not
[1:11:27] and who should betray him
[1:11:29] and he said therefore i said unto you
[1:11:32] that no man can come to me except it
[1:11:36] were given unto him of my father
[1:11:39] and from that time many of his disciples
[1:11:42] went back and walked
[1:11:44] no more with him
[1:11:46] hard sayings that he couldn't take him
[1:11:50] then said jesus unto the twelve will you
[1:11:53] also go away
[1:11:56] then simon peter answered him lord to
[1:12:00] whom shall we go
[1:12:02] for thou has the words of eternal life
[1:12:07] and we believe that
[1:12:09] and are sure that thou art
[1:12:12] that christ the son of the living god
[1:12:17] jesus answered him
[1:12:20] have i not chosen
[1:12:23] you 12 and one of you is a devil
[1:12:27] he spake of judas is a carrot the son of
[1:12:30] simon
[1:12:31] for he it was that should betray him
[1:12:35] being one of the twelve
[1:12:37] now
[1:12:39] if i
[1:12:40] should call this a subject for tonight
[1:12:45] and try my best to make that half our
[1:12:48] count
[1:12:49] i want to talk on
[1:12:51] three kinds of believers
[1:12:55] and i've often made the statement i
[1:12:56] thought well i'll just believe i'll
[1:12:58] preach on it one time this afternoon i
[1:13:00] thought then
[1:13:01] the first is believers make believers
[1:13:04] and unbelievers
[1:13:05] now that is quite a a
[1:13:08] subject
[1:13:09] but as sure as we sit here tonight
[1:13:14] that group is always together together
[1:13:18] wherever the people gather we find this
[1:13:21] group and always have found them and we
[1:13:24] probably always will have them until the
[1:13:26] coming of the lord
[1:13:28] and i want us tonight to picture
[1:13:30] ourselves as i speak of these three
[1:13:32] groups and see
[1:13:34] what group that we are in
[1:13:38] now remember i'm speaking here to maybe
[1:13:40] uh this church
[1:13:42] packed again tonight around in the walls
[1:13:45] and corners but
[1:13:47] i'm also speaking
[1:13:49] the world around see and all different
[1:13:53] parts of the world these tapes circulate
[1:13:54] through ministries of the tapes
[1:13:57] now
[1:13:58] i want to speak of the three different
[1:14:00] types of believers now
[1:14:02] now remember believers my subject is
[1:14:05] believers one of them is a true believer
[1:14:08] and the next is a make-believer
[1:14:11] and the next is an unbeliever i think
[1:14:14] now the first group we'd like to talk
[1:14:16] about
[1:14:17] is
[1:14:17] the believer because i think he ought to
[1:14:20] be first
[1:14:21] because he is the one that truly
[1:14:23] believes
[1:14:24] now
[1:14:25] believes like the disciples believed her
[1:14:28] we're going to use this uh scripture
[1:14:30] reading for example now the first is
[1:14:34] believers genuine believers and faith
[1:14:37] cometh by hearing
[1:14:40] hearing of the word of god
[1:14:43] the word of god which is christ see
[1:14:48] believers now
[1:14:50] did you notice this great statement this
[1:14:52] believer made now a believer doesn't
[1:14:55] have to be a smart person in the world's
[1:14:59] way of being smart he doesn't have to be
[1:15:01] an educated person
[1:15:03] in the way that uh these people uh try
[1:15:07] to uh to
[1:15:08] say that you have to be but you do not
[1:15:12] yeah
[1:15:13] this man that made this statement
[1:15:16] the bible itself said that he was both
[1:15:19] ignorant and unlearned
[1:15:21] peter
[1:15:22] he was not a uh really considered an
[1:15:25] intelligent person
[1:15:27] and isaiah 35 says there shall be a
[1:15:31] highway
[1:15:32] and a way and it shall be called the way
[1:15:35] of holiness the unclean shall not pass
[1:15:38] over
[1:15:39] i was talking one of the deacons this
[1:15:40] afternoon as we talk about the bridges
[1:15:42] spanning across this new one i said
[1:15:44] there's many expansions
[1:15:46] across bodies of water
[1:15:48] bios today
[1:15:50] and i said but there's one great
[1:15:52] expansion
[1:15:53] that reaches some earth to glory it's
[1:15:56] called the king's highway
[1:15:58] the unclean shall not pass over it
[1:16:01] that's right it's a a road that's built
[1:16:03] by christ our lord the expansion
[1:16:07] that is made from this earth to another
[1:16:10] land
[1:16:11] uh
[1:16:12] and the unclean doesn't pass over peter
[1:16:15] this unlearned person
[1:16:18] of uh standing there when he had saw the
[1:16:22] thoroughly uh vindicated
[1:16:25] word of the day
[1:16:27] that god promised in that day that there
[1:16:31] would be a one rise up which should be a
[1:16:34] a prophet among them and simon was hard
[1:16:37] to believe it because there were been so
[1:16:39] many impersonations of it
[1:16:41] but when he seen the genuine unfolded
[1:16:44] word of that age
[1:16:46] and here he properly identified
[1:16:49] he he was certainly convinced
[1:16:52] who he was
[1:16:54] and uh he was the one said uh lord to
[1:16:58] whom would we go
[1:17:01] when it was asked him when the
[1:17:03] crowds were separating between the
[1:17:04] believers and unbelievers and make
[1:17:06] believers there was all three of them
[1:17:08] standing right there and that one
[1:17:10] company of people believers make
[1:17:12] believers and unbelievers
[1:17:14] write down in this chapter right here
[1:17:16] and because that jesus said spoke the
[1:17:19] words the way he had it separated his
[1:17:21] congregation
[1:17:22] but it must be done he was a great man
[1:17:25] as long as he healed the sick but when
[1:17:27] he come down to the doctrine and the
[1:17:30] prophecy that's what separated the the
[1:17:33] chat from the wheat
[1:17:34] the chapel wraps around the wheat is not
[1:17:37] the wheat it cannot be used there's
[1:17:38] nothing in it no life and it's a husk
[1:17:41] and it cannot stay with the wheat it
[1:17:42] will be air with the wheat
[1:17:44] and so it's got just the green is what
[1:17:46] we're talking about the heart of the
[1:17:48] grain of the wheat now notice
[1:17:52] uh
[1:17:53] peter was convinced that that was a
[1:17:55] messiah
[1:17:57] now i don't make any difference what all
[1:17:58] the rest of them said it didn't make any
[1:18:00] difference what the priest said
[1:18:02] didn't matter to simon peter what the
[1:18:04] church said
[1:18:06] he was convinced himself
[1:18:09] jesus told him in one place where he
[1:18:10] asked who does man say i am and some
[1:18:12] said you're a prophet some said you want
[1:18:14] the old prophets raised up
[1:18:16] and your moses or elias or somebody said
[1:18:18] i asked you what do you think and peter
[1:18:21] said die to christ amen
[1:18:24] the son of the living god he said
[1:18:26] blessed art thou the son of jonas
[1:18:29] simon the son of jonas for flesh and
[1:18:31] blood never revealed this to you
[1:18:33] you never learned it from a book or from
[1:18:35] a creed or from a catechism
[1:18:38] you my father which is in heaven has
[1:18:40] revealed this to you there's a genuine
[1:18:43] believer
[1:18:44] spiritual revelation of the word
[1:18:48] and up guard simon
[1:18:51] and upon this rock of your revelation of
[1:18:53] who i am i'll build my church
[1:18:55] and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:18:57] against them see no wonder simon said to
[1:19:00] whom would we go
[1:19:03] jesus turned and said do you wish to go
[1:19:05] also
[1:19:06] and they said
[1:19:07] lord who would we where would we go to
[1:19:10] for thou alone has the words of life
[1:19:13] you're the only one for not only did he
[1:19:17] have the words of life he was the word
[1:19:19] of lies and he was
[1:19:22] the word of life
[1:19:24] and simon thoroughly recognized this and
[1:19:27] when he recognized it that was what that
[1:19:31] kept his hope because it was revealed to
[1:19:34] him that he was that living word now
[1:19:37] that's a genuine believer
[1:19:39] when the holy spirit not some persuaded
[1:19:42] by some other person
[1:19:43] not for some other thing but one the
[1:19:46] holy spirit has revealed to you the word
[1:19:50] itself
[1:19:52] and you see the word made plain
[1:19:55] vindicated then the spirit of god come
[1:19:57] and get into that age for the word for
[1:20:00] that age and make it
[1:20:02] manifested
[1:20:04] how could a man kept from believing
[1:20:05] luther if you know that luther was a
[1:20:07] reformer
[1:20:09] the man's spirit went forth there for
[1:20:11] reformation
[1:20:13] wesley the same way they had to believe
[1:20:15] it
[1:20:16] see that was that was a message to the
[1:20:18] church age that was exactly what was
[1:20:21] happening
[1:20:22] that's what was to take place you had to
[1:20:24] believe it and here we are down to the
[1:20:26] lady austen age
[1:20:28] and we were taught in the lady of seeing
[1:20:30] age that christ was put out of his
[1:20:33] church
[1:20:34] and was even knocking on the door trying
[1:20:36] to get back in
[1:20:38] so when we see that happening we know
[1:20:40] what age we're living in and then we're
[1:20:42] at the closing of the history of the
[1:20:45] world the book is now being finished the
[1:20:48] last line will be wrote across it
[1:20:50] someday and shall be closed up
[1:20:52] man time shall be no more
[1:20:55] and there's a great drama being set
[1:20:57] and angels are standing over the skies
[1:21:00] watching you know what our drama is
[1:21:02] the actors are ready
[1:21:05] you can see him acting
[1:21:07] you can see the evil one acting you can
[1:21:10] see the villain of the plane
[1:21:12] heist come on the scene with his
[1:21:13] cunningness to deceive but you can also
[1:21:17] see the raptured church making herself
[1:21:19] ready
[1:21:20] it's a great scene
[1:21:22] you can see the presence of god
[1:21:25] vindicating and making the great drama
[1:21:27] that's foretold here in this bible to
[1:21:29] act itself out what a time to live the
[1:21:32] most glorious time the man of all ages
[1:21:35] is long for this time
[1:21:36] the prophets of old
[1:21:38] long to see this hour
[1:21:40] but wasn't privileged now there was a
[1:21:43] believer because he seen it he believe
[1:21:45] it we're fully persuaded that our the
[1:21:48] christ the messiah the word of god for
[1:21:50] this day and we believe that
[1:21:53] that was a real believer let's just take
[1:21:55] up a few more believers right quick
[1:21:57] before we go to the next character
[1:22:00] let's take
[1:22:01] the prophet noah
[1:22:04] when he being maybe a farmer perhaps he
[1:22:07] wasn't them these a farmer but when the
[1:22:10] scoffers and religionists of that day
[1:22:12] the church got to a low end and god
[1:22:16] spoke to noah
[1:22:17] and told noah that he was to build an
[1:22:19] ark
[1:22:20] no one never debated that with god
[1:22:23] he believed it it was the word of god
[1:22:25] and went to work right quick making
[1:22:26] things ready
[1:22:28] that's a real believer
[1:22:29] don't fuss about it when you're
[1:22:31] thoroughly convinced that's it
[1:22:33] just like anyone any faith anyway faith
[1:22:36] cometh by hearing if you can stand here
[1:22:38] no matter what the doctor says is wrong
[1:22:39] with you which the man gives you the
[1:22:41] diagnosis of the cases and probably
[1:22:43] knows just what he's talking about as
[1:22:44] far as his instruments and knowledge
[1:22:46] will permit him to know
[1:22:48] but he says there's nothing left but
[1:22:49] death but you pray
[1:22:51] and standing on her in the future you
[1:22:53] can see a well-mannered woman standing
[1:22:55] there
[1:22:56] that's it
[1:22:57] that's just it you'll walk right into
[1:22:59] that it's as certain as anything because
[1:23:02] you believe it
[1:23:04] god has spoken you know it's so
[1:23:07] like the little woman coughing up the
[1:23:08] cancer see there's no doubt in her mind
[1:23:10] that's going to happen
[1:23:12] the cancer was dead and it turned loose
[1:23:13] in the way it went see that's it you
[1:23:15] believe it
[1:23:16] like that father brought his little boy
[1:23:18] a while ago in there and he shared a
[1:23:20] building somewhere now the little boy
[1:23:22] had a phone and lost his memory he
[1:23:23] couldn't remember anything justin a few
[1:23:26] moments after prayer
[1:23:28] i asked him his name he told me how old
[1:23:29] he was there he was just as normal as
[1:23:31] anybody could be see
[1:23:33] they believe and when god says anything
[1:23:36] it must be that way
[1:23:38] and noah believed god and noah was
[1:23:40] considered a believer amen daniel
[1:23:44] when the church was in captivity down in
[1:23:47] babylon
[1:23:48] daniel believed god and no matter how
[1:23:51] much they said we make a proclamation
[1:23:53] that i've prayed another god but this
[1:23:55] image out there of this holy man or
[1:23:57] whatever it might be
[1:23:58] daniel didn't pay any attention to that
[1:24:00] he had heard god
[1:24:02] for he was the prophet and the word came
[1:24:04] to him
[1:24:06] and when the temple was dedicated it was
[1:24:07] said if any man is in trouble in any
[1:24:10] country look this way towards the holy
[1:24:12] place and pray then hear from heaven and
[1:24:14] daniel believed god he was a genuine
[1:24:17] believer and even the lions couldn't eat
[1:24:20] him
[1:24:21] see he was a believer he had something
[1:24:24] real and genuine he was a believer
[1:24:27] david another believer
[1:24:29] a little off-scale of a boy
[1:24:32] daniel didn't take the place with the
[1:24:33] modern church
[1:24:35] neither did noah take the place with the
[1:24:36] modern church not at all they was
[1:24:39] believers in what god said to be the
[1:24:41] truth no matter what the modern world
[1:24:43] said they believed what god said was the
[1:24:45] truth that's genuine believers just same
[1:24:47] as peter did and the apostles
[1:24:49] they believe that he had the word of
[1:24:51] life and was the word of life
[1:24:53] i believe the same thing today and every
[1:24:56] other thing against it is contrary
[1:24:58] it's not it's death
[1:25:00] this alone is the word of life and
[1:25:02] christ is the word
[1:25:05] now david
[1:25:06] a ready fellow the first place he was
[1:25:09] probably picked on by his brothers
[1:25:11] because he's a little felon he wasn't
[1:25:13] big enough to bear an armor he couldn't
[1:25:15] go to war and he was too little and
[1:25:17] scrawny and yet he got out there as a
[1:25:20] believer and as he set back on the
[1:25:23] desert watching a a few
[1:25:25] dozen sheep that his father had given
[1:25:27] him to watch over with a sling shot in a
[1:25:29] country where there's lines and bears
[1:25:31] and wolves and so forth david began to
[1:25:33] look upon the shady green pastures
[1:25:37] and know what it meant to sheep to get
[1:25:38] down in that shade and lay down in the
[1:25:40] heat of the sun no what a good cold
[1:25:43] drink of water man as he said as a heart
[1:25:45] thirst after water broke my soul thirst
[1:25:47] after the old god
[1:25:50] he had cried
[1:25:51] prayed
[1:25:53] and one day the emergency arose a lion
[1:25:56] grabbed one of his sheep and took off
[1:25:59] he thought the god that made me superior
[1:26:01] to the lion
[1:26:02] see
[1:26:03] and he took the slingshot and knocked
[1:26:05] the line down with a little rock and the
[1:26:07] slingshot now if anybody ever seen a
[1:26:09] line one of them african lines big
[1:26:11] woolly necklines that they have their
[1:26:12] palestine agent didn't know what one of
[1:26:15] them fellas was when a great big 300
[1:26:17] magnum harley knocking down and he
[1:26:19] knocked him down with a rock
[1:26:21] and when the lion rose up at you he
[1:26:23] grabbed him by the beard and killed him
[1:26:26] that's the reason
[1:26:27] he knowed what he was talking about
[1:26:31] it had an experience
[1:26:33] it put god to the test amen about his
[1:26:36] word
[1:26:37] and he he wasn't afraid of god because
[1:26:41] he was uncircumcised
[1:26:42] he wasn't a believer at all
[1:26:45] and when god come out and cursed him in
[1:26:47] the name of his gods
[1:26:48] and leglot many times a larger and he
[1:26:51] was great big fellow 14 inch fingers on
[1:26:53] him now the fingers would be that long
[1:26:55] see 14 inch fingers a wire
[1:26:58] and probably the coat of nail that he
[1:27:00] had on he probably weighed 300 pounds or
[1:27:02] more see that he had on him a helmet and
[1:27:05] a great probably the metal inch and a
[1:27:07] half thick a great big giant like that
[1:27:10] walking with a with a weaver's needle
[1:27:12] which is claimed to be around 20 feet
[1:27:14] you have 20 foot spear in his hand how
[1:27:17] how could anyone a man like i could just
[1:27:19] stand and pick up a dozen man and throw
[1:27:21] him like that is he come up
[1:27:22] what an opposition
[1:27:24] and they were standing there
[1:27:26] boasting himself
[1:27:28] bragging one of the seems like the odds
[1:27:31] is down you see he said that don't have
[1:27:33] no bloodshed said let some man come
[1:27:36] fight me and then if i win then you
[1:27:38] ought to serve me and then if if you win
[1:27:40] that we'll serve you see when the devil
[1:27:43] thinks he's got the odds on you see
[1:27:45] that's when he likes to make his brain
[1:27:47] but he missed the wrong man
[1:27:49] he met the littlest man in the country
[1:27:51] amen little stoop shoulder ruddy looking
[1:27:53] fella he said do you mean to tell me
[1:27:55] that you the
[1:27:57] army of the living god will stand there
[1:27:59] and let that uncircumcised philistine
[1:28:02] defy the army of the living god
[1:28:05] why he was shocked at it why
[1:28:08] why
[1:28:08] he was a believer
[1:28:10] the others were make believers
[1:28:14] see he was a genuine believer he said if
[1:28:17] you're afraid i'll go fight me what a
[1:28:20] challenge for a little guy like that
[1:28:23] and so
[1:28:24] he was a believer and he done just
[1:28:27] exactly
[1:28:28] what he know that god would do he's when
[1:28:31] that uncircumcised philistine cursed him
[1:28:34] in the name of his gods he said am i a
[1:28:36] dog a little bitty run of a kid come out
[1:28:39] like that why said i'll pick you up on
[1:28:41] the end of my spirit and i'll hang you
[1:28:42] up there in the tree and let the birds
[1:28:43] pick your flesh oh my
[1:28:46] oh what a horrible fellow he will david
[1:28:48] said you meet me with a sword and a
[1:28:50] spear with an armor
[1:28:52] you meet me in the name of the
[1:28:53] philistine but i meet you without a
[1:28:56] sword or spirit armor but i'll meet you
[1:28:58] in the name of the lord god of israel
[1:29:01] that's a believer
[1:29:02] that's his fortress that's his shield
[1:29:05] that's his defense amen
[1:29:07] that should be the church's defense any
[1:29:09] believer that's his defense
[1:29:12] no matter what takes place what the
[1:29:14] world says anything else your defense is
[1:29:16] the lord god of israel that's it the
[1:29:19] name of jesus christ is a mighty tower
[1:29:22] the righteous run into it and are safe
[1:29:25] left our defense of jesus christ
[1:29:27] notice and when it comes to pass we know
[1:29:30] what happened david nowhere to hit with
[1:29:33] that one little place when he dropped
[1:29:35] down his is uh his cover over his face
[1:29:38] one place to hit was right here in his
[1:29:40] forehead and before he could get with
[1:29:42] any distance to the the giant god
[1:29:44] directed the killing mark and he slew
[1:29:47] the giant
[1:29:48] see god did it now we notice he was a
[1:29:51] believer now another believer was
[1:29:53] abraham
[1:29:55] and he was of this a child ian of the
[1:29:57] city of era and he was called upon to do
[1:30:01] something that was and believe something
[1:30:03] that was totally
[1:30:05] physically impossible
[1:30:09] but he didn't stagger
[1:30:11] at the promise of god through unbelief
[1:30:13] says romans 4
[1:30:15] but was strong giving praise to god
[1:30:18] when abraham was 75 years old
[1:30:21] and his wife's 65 years old and had been
[1:30:24] living together since they were young
[1:30:26] boys this is half sister a young boy and
[1:30:28] a young girl and that was they lived
[1:30:30] together without any children at all
[1:30:33] and god told abraham separate yourself
[1:30:36] from the unbelievers god always calls
[1:30:38] from separation amen separate yourself
[1:30:41] from the unbelievers and walk with me
[1:30:43] and i have made you a father of many
[1:30:46] nations i've already done it and abraham
[1:30:49] believed it that's a believer
[1:30:52] how are you going to do it lord he never
[1:30:53] asked the question god said he'd do it
[1:30:55] and that settled it
[1:30:56] won the first month passed and sarah was
[1:30:59] still just past menopause anything
[1:31:01] different not a thing but abraham still
[1:31:04] believed it
[1:31:05] 25 years later
[1:31:07] there was still no difference
[1:31:10] but abraham still believes it
[1:31:12] amen that's a believer
[1:31:17] that's a believer
[1:31:19] 25 years later abraham was stronger than
[1:31:22] he was at the first place
[1:31:25] he believed god and it was imputed unto
[1:31:29] him for righteousness because he be
[1:31:31] that's a genuine believer
[1:31:33] now
[1:31:34] after a while i'm going to let you
[1:31:36] search and see what class you're in now
[1:31:38] what did abraham do
[1:31:40] stagger not
[1:31:42] at the promise of god the
[1:31:44] impossibilities
[1:31:46] what would a man 75 years old with a 65
[1:31:49] year old wife do if they went to a
[1:31:51] doctor and said we want to make
[1:31:52] arrangements a hospital we're going to
[1:31:53] have a baby
[1:31:55] and then 25 years later said doc you
[1:31:57] still own a hospital open
[1:32:01] it makes you act funny
[1:32:04] your decisions are odd to the world
[1:32:07] but it's a believer
[1:32:09] no matter how strange it seems
[1:32:11] the bible said that he is fully
[1:32:13] persuaded that god was able to perform
[1:32:16] what he said he'd do
[1:32:18] that ought to be the achievement of
[1:32:20] every believer this afternoon
[1:32:23] god's able to keep every word that he
[1:32:25] said he do i don't care what the
[1:32:27] denomination says words days of miracles
[1:32:29] his past and all this is telepathy and
[1:32:31] all those fortune telling
[1:32:33] it doesn't matter to me what they say i
[1:32:36] still believe that that gun is zeroed to
[1:32:38] the target it'll hit the target
[1:32:40] i believe if a believer is zero with the
[1:32:43] word of god it'll hit the same thing as
[1:32:44] the word of god ever promised it
[1:32:47] it'll do it again
[1:32:48] i'm fully persuaded of that
[1:32:51] that when we see we're in this age when
[1:32:53] it's supposed to be here
[1:32:55] right it's supposed to be here these
[1:32:57] things are supposed to take place that's
[1:32:59] the reason i do believe that when that
[1:33:02] bride is called out and elected and said
[1:33:04] in the book of life there will come a
[1:33:06] sound from heaven that'll take such a
[1:33:08] baptism of the holy spirit into that
[1:33:10] bride they'll take her from the earth
[1:33:16] all right don't care how many sides how
[1:33:18] many astronauts they signed up and
[1:33:20] everything else and how many million
[1:33:22] miles they can see i don't care nothing
[1:33:23] about that there is a heaven
[1:33:26] and there's a literal jesus christ there
[1:33:29] that'll come in the body foreign
[1:33:41] god said i'm the lord he is all thy
[1:33:43] diseases i am god and i change not
[1:33:46] amen and god is word and if god don't
[1:33:48] change how's the word go to change
[1:33:52] i am god and i choose not
[1:33:54] scripture says that god said it himself
[1:33:56] and if he cannot change and he is the
[1:33:58] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:34:00] the word was with god and the word was
[1:34:02] god the unchangeable word and the word
[1:34:06] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:34:11] yes sir god raised up bodies all down
[1:34:13] through moses and ezekiel and jeremiah
[1:34:16] isaiah and elijah's all down words were
[1:34:18] temporarily come but the full word was
[1:34:20] made manifest in this man jesus christ
[1:34:23] which he was god in the god in the
[1:34:26] fullness of the godhead bodily amen
[1:34:28] there he was made flesh i believe that
[1:34:30] every word amen job another believer
[1:34:34] sometimes believers put to the test
[1:34:37] not sometimes every time amen
[1:34:40] but every son that cometh to god must be
[1:34:42] chasing
[1:34:45] child trained
[1:34:46] remember the trials the dusty roads the
[1:34:50] hot sun of persecution
[1:34:52] but the loyalty of your heart beats that
[1:34:55] material until she's ready to go into
[1:34:57] the mood
[1:34:58] god's children is made up correctly on
[1:35:00] his word for they are living examples
[1:35:04] and the word of god living through them
[1:35:07] see the trial comes to shake you to put
[1:35:10] you to the very bottom to see where
[1:35:12] you'll stand see
[1:35:14] tested tried
[1:35:16] every son to come up to god amen job
[1:35:19] went through the trials in the tests
[1:35:21] his children taken everything else taken
[1:35:24] the church members come accusing me of a
[1:35:26] secret center and tried to say
[1:35:28] everything against him but yet he
[1:35:30] wouldn't listen to any of it
[1:35:32] he knowed he had met god's requirements
[1:35:36] he know there's no need of satan trying
[1:35:37] to tempt him
[1:35:39] that's right he thought it was a devil
[1:35:42] and as long as satan could make him
[1:35:43] believe that his sickness was his god
[1:35:46] doing it he had job whipped
[1:35:48] but when job once struck that revelation
[1:35:50] that it was not god
[1:35:53] amen he was only going through his
[1:35:55] trials to make him something
[1:35:57] it wasn't god doing it with satan doing
[1:36:00] it
[1:36:01] same thing today he'll try to tell you
[1:36:02] these trials and things you're god
[1:36:04] trying to put punishment upon you it
[1:36:06] isn't so
[1:36:07] no sir it's satan doing that god
[1:36:09] permitting it to temper you
[1:36:12] to make you see if you're you're tied to
[1:36:14] this earth by the earth cares or whether
[1:36:16] your treasure is in heaven for wherever
[1:36:18] your treasures is there you are also
[1:36:22] your heart is where your treasures are
[1:36:25] job tried yet he said i know my redeemer

[1:37:16] he said it job why he was a believer
[1:37:19] trials he was a believer
[1:37:21] persecution he was a believer he was a
[1:37:24] genuine believer joseph another believer
[1:37:27] he couldn't help being what he was he's
[1:37:29] a prophet
[1:37:30] god made him a prophet he didn't want to
[1:37:32] be different from his brothers but he
[1:37:34] was different god made him what he is
[1:37:37] nobody else could take his place
[1:37:39] nobody can take your place
[1:37:41] no matter how little you say i miss the
[1:37:42] housewife nobody can take your place god
[1:37:45] in this great economy has so set your
[1:37:47] the body of christ in order till there's
[1:37:49] no one can take your place
[1:37:51] i would like to take billy graham's
[1:37:52] place any of us ministers but we can't
[1:37:55] do it but just remember billy can't take
[1:37:57] our place
[1:37:58] we all have a place
[1:38:00] some observances some prophets some
[1:38:03] teachers some pastors whatever we are
[1:38:06] some housewives some mechanics some
[1:38:09] farmers whatever it is god has set you
[1:38:11] in your place see
[1:38:14] joseph was a prophet he couldn't help
[1:38:16] because he could interpret dreams he
[1:38:18] couldn't help because that he saw
[1:38:20] visions
[1:38:21] watch how tree was no matter if it cost
[1:38:23] him his fellowship with his brothers he
[1:38:25] was true because he believed those
[1:38:27] dreams he believed that the dream that
[1:38:29] he had that that all bowed to him the
[1:38:31] sheaves would it come to pass because he
[1:38:33] believed it he was a genuine believer
[1:38:36] how i got five minutes and 10 pages
[1:38:39] notice
[1:38:40] no
[1:38:40] notice of scripture wrote out here
[1:38:43] the woman
[1:38:45] nathanael
[1:38:46] he was a believer is that right
[1:38:49] nathaniel when he saw what took place
[1:38:52] and it worked on him that jesus told him
[1:38:54] who he was and said he was a an
[1:38:56] israelite indeed and there was no gal in
[1:38:59] him and told him where he was the day
[1:39:00] before praying under a tree he saw him
[1:39:02] and when philip called him he was a
[1:39:04] believer
[1:39:05] there's many stand there said this is
[1:39:07] the devil's spirit
[1:39:09] the devil does divine healing that old
[1:39:11] devil hasn't died yet today
[1:39:13] they believe that the devil does divine
[1:39:15] healing
[1:39:16] jesus said if satan can cast out satan
[1:39:18] then his kingdom's divided and our
[1:39:20] kingdom can't stand i think
[1:39:22] satan said it he can't do it so satan
[1:39:25] cannot cast out satan
[1:39:27] so nathanael was a believer and when he
[1:39:30] seen the word made flesh vindicated that
[1:39:34] he was a believer he said the heart a
[1:39:37] rabbi the art the christ art the king of
[1:39:40] israel he believed it when the woman at
[1:39:42] the well saw it
[1:39:44] she believed it she is a believer when
[1:39:47] blind bartimaeus when a woman combined
[1:39:50] everybody's crying going on some i'm
[1:39:53] saying there's a hole i hear you raise
[1:39:54] the dead there's a graveyard full of
[1:39:56] them up here come up raise them let us
[1:39:58] see you do it see that same devil that
[1:39:59] said if thou be the son of god command
[1:40:01] these stones to be turned to bread
[1:40:03] same one put a rag around his face hit
[1:40:05] him on the head said pass the stick one
[1:40:07] to the other so now
[1:40:09] if you tell us you hit you we'll believe
[1:40:10] you them soldiers i think making fun of
[1:40:13] you it looked like the card chip was
[1:40:15] down on him but just remember god's
[1:40:17] always on the scene
[1:40:19] he's right there already at any time
[1:40:21] now jesus said i could speak to my
[1:40:23] father straight when he'd send me 12
[1:40:24] legions of angels oh wha one angel do
[1:40:28] but you see but he just sent 12 legions
[1:40:30] just in his command
[1:40:32] but he had a job to do he had something
[1:40:34] to do he had to go through that you've
[1:40:36] got something to do god's got something
[1:40:38] for you to do you may have some
[1:40:40] heartaches and some troubles you may
[1:40:42] have some disappointments but do we pray
[1:40:45] to shun them
[1:40:46] no lord take me through them whatever it
[1:40:48] is whatever it is don't let me escape
[1:40:50] them if they're set for me just give me
[1:40:52] grace to go through that that's all now
[1:40:55] i noticed blind bartimaeus he knew that
[1:40:57] they was told this is that prophet of
[1:41:00] jai galilee he's the son of david we
[1:41:02] believe it some of the believers must
[1:41:04] have told him that we believers know
[1:41:06] that he is the uh that son of david and
[1:41:10] he knew if he was he was the word if he
[1:41:12] knowed he was the word he know he could
[1:41:15] discern the thoughts of the heart so he
[1:41:16] cried thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:41:19] the unbelievers is hollering this and
[1:41:21] that the church members that didn't stop
[1:41:23] blind barnabas at all he said oh
[1:41:26] uh jesus thou son of david have mercy
[1:41:29] upon me perhaps he couldn't hear him but
[1:41:32] he know he was crying and he stopped and
[1:41:34] turned around there was a believer he
[1:41:36] said thy faith has saved him amen he
[1:41:40] said that to the woman with the blood
[1:41:42] issue the same thing thy faith cause she
[1:41:44] said within her heart if i can touch his
[1:41:46] garment i'll be made well thy faith has
[1:41:49] saved me see she was a believer
[1:41:52] that's the same thing as saved william
[1:41:54] dao sitting there the other day with a
[1:41:56] complete heart failure and a heart
[1:41:57] attack a man 91 years old
[1:42:00] the faith of savior why is the believer
[1:42:04] reverend tom kid here
[1:42:06] you're going into his nearly i guess
[1:42:08] wait around 90 years now
[1:42:10] oh close to it
[1:42:12] and when he was uh 79 years old
[1:42:17] they took him to the hospital with a
[1:42:18] cancer on the prostrate
[1:42:20] the doctor says he hasn't got a chance
[1:42:23] but when we walked in that morning seen
[1:42:25] that little patriarch with a shawl over
[1:42:26] his shoulders sitting there beating a
[1:42:28] little cane is almost beside himself he
[1:42:30] said to an old woman sitting there
[1:42:31] called her grandmother
[1:42:33] notor one of these members for years
[1:42:35] said you look as white as snow
[1:42:37] beyond this mental thinking
[1:42:39] yet when the power of god struck the
[1:42:41] room
[1:42:43] he's alive tonight that's been four
[1:42:45] years ago a man nearly
[1:42:47] 80 years old
[1:42:49] and here he sits tonight perfectly
[1:42:51] sounding well from the cancer
[1:42:54] not a make believer a believer
[1:42:57] that's it believe he takes god at his
[1:42:59] word just the same as blind bartimaeus
[1:43:01] was blind but yet he noted he could
[1:43:03] attract the attention of jesus christ
[1:43:05] he'd get what he wanted the woman
[1:43:07] noticed she could touch his garment
[1:43:08] she'd get what he wanted she'd get what
[1:43:10] she wanted tom knew he had faith if i
[1:43:13] pray for him he'd get what he wanted
[1:43:15] and that's the same faith that martha
[1:43:17] said even though lord whatever you ask
[1:43:20] god god will do it for you my brothers
[1:43:22] laying on the dead four days in the
[1:43:23] grave but you just ask god and god will
[1:43:25] do it for you he said thy brother shall
[1:43:28] rise again and she said yes lord in the
[1:43:30] last days at the resurrection he arises
[1:43:33] a good boy said but i am that
[1:43:34] resurrection alive amen amen
[1:43:41] that's it it's over yes sir
[1:43:43] the queen of the south
[1:43:45] come up in that generation of
[1:43:47] unbelievers
[1:43:48] that's right and stood there and
[1:43:50] believed what she saw to be of god
[1:43:54] the bible said she raised up from the
[1:43:55] last day with that generation and
[1:43:57] condemned it because she came from the
[1:43:59] utmost parts of the world to hear the
[1:44:00] wisdom of solomon
[1:44:01] moses was a believer
[1:44:04] though he tried intellectually he tried
[1:44:06] every scheme he could but it wouldn't
[1:44:07] work he tried to take israel out knowing
[1:44:10] he was called to do it he tried the
[1:44:12] mathematical way he tried the military
[1:44:13] where he tried the educational way he
[1:44:15] tried every way but it wouldn't work
[1:44:18] but then he took god's way what happened
[1:44:20] there's a fire on a bush up there one
[1:44:22] day they wouldn't leave
[1:44:25] from there the word spoke to him said i
[1:44:28] am not i was or i will be i am and he is
[1:44:32] still the eye of him he is the word the
[1:44:35] eternal everlasting word moses did not
[1:44:38] doubt the difficulties against him every
[1:44:41] nature against him everything against
[1:44:43] him by the crooked stick in his hand he
[1:44:44] went down and took over the whole nation
[1:44:46] drowned it in the dead sea out there
[1:44:48] took israel to the promised land
[1:44:50] why he believed god
[1:44:53] but he had a that's the believer we
[1:44:56] could say i've stayed by half our on the
[1:44:58] believers got two more classes we'll
[1:45:00] hurry through them because they're not
[1:45:01] important anyhow
[1:45:03] then secondly
[1:45:05] there comes now the unbeliever let's
[1:45:07] speak of the unbeliever next
[1:45:09] what does the unbeliever do we see the
[1:45:11] believer what accepts the word
[1:45:15] errors every generation for all the way
[1:45:18] from noah all the way up we could take
[1:45:20] six months of revival right on that
[1:45:22] right there bringing up the characters
[1:45:24] they believe the believer don't question
[1:45:27] the believer believes it regardless of
[1:45:29] what it sounds like or what anybody else
[1:45:31] has got to say about it how impossible
[1:45:33] it seems to be the believer believes it
[1:45:35] please want the word
[1:45:38] not to creed the word
[1:45:40] not the denomination the word
[1:45:42] not what somebody else says what the
[1:45:44] word says
[1:45:45] i remember that is the believer the
[1:45:47] believer doesn't question the believer
[1:45:49] doesn't say how can it be if i can get
[1:45:51] explained that's the unbeliever
[1:45:53] it's a believer that no matter what it
[1:45:55] is
[1:45:56] if it's a word it's the word
[1:45:59] that's true that's the believer now the
[1:46:01] unbeliever now we see what's take the
[1:46:04] unbelievers we find out that they did
[1:46:06] all right as long as they get padded on
[1:46:08] the back and call disciples
[1:46:10] as long as they everything went fine
[1:46:12] they were all right but when this
[1:46:14] prophet that they believed to be a
[1:46:16] prophet and no was that could heal the
[1:46:18] sick and so forth what did he do
[1:46:21] when the real truth and the rebuke came
[1:46:24] contrary to what they believed they
[1:46:26] couldn't take the word that's right amen
[1:46:28] they could take the miracles and they
[1:46:30] performed them
[1:46:31] they would not cast out devils
[1:46:34] preach the word
[1:46:35] and still
[1:46:39] amen unbelievers 10
[1:46:41] he sent them out
[1:46:42] two by two the seventy and they cast out
[1:46:45] devils in so much that jesus rejoiced
[1:46:48] and said i've seen satan falling
[1:46:51] like light from heaven see they cast out
[1:46:53] devils judas right with them here comes
[1:46:56] the unbelievers but as soon as jesus
[1:46:58] began to say
[1:47:00] that he was something that he was the
[1:47:02] resurrection he was alive what would you
[1:47:05] say if you seen the son of man ascend up
[1:47:07] from where he come from now this man
[1:47:09] trying to say he come from heaven that's
[1:47:11] too much for us we can't believe it he
[1:47:13] said what is it the flesh that you're
[1:47:15] talking about prophet nothing
[1:47:17] it's a spirit
[1:47:18] that quickens yes
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:25] it's a spirit not the creed the spirit
[1:47:28] of a holy ghost
[1:47:29] quickens the word to you
[1:47:31] it becomes alive and there you are you
[1:47:33] see it
[1:47:34] by faith you see it you know it's so
[1:47:36] because the word said so and the spirit
[1:47:37] quickens the word to you there you are
[1:47:40] now i said what and as soon as we did
[1:47:42] this we find out the unbelievers when
[1:47:44] you say something that they don't agree
[1:47:45] with they walk out on him
[1:47:49] i just want oh that's getting so dense
[1:47:51] in the world today
[1:47:53] start and you'll say something they'll
[1:47:55] gather in i notice that meetings they'll
[1:47:56] gather in great crowds and you stand up
[1:47:59] start saying something nice long they'll
[1:48:02] sit there just watching just waiting and
[1:48:05] as soon as you say now jesus christ
[1:48:08] uh identified himself as messiah
[1:48:11] because that he was a prophet
[1:48:13] that jug's done for the way it goes
[1:48:15] somebody
[1:48:17] the way they go what is it unbelievers
[1:48:19] how you say you're making that up i'm
[1:48:21] not i'm saying just exactly what the
[1:48:23] bible says here
[1:48:24] they were unbelievers and they walked
[1:48:26] out though they were disciples
[1:48:28] but it was contrary to what they said
[1:48:31] this who could believe a thing like that
[1:48:33] there's pharisees and sadducees that
[1:48:36] come out jordan went in with him because
[1:48:39] see when the when the supernatural is
[1:48:41] displayed it produces three different
[1:48:43] types it did down in egypt it produced
[1:48:46] the unbeliever the believer and make
[1:48:48] believer it did all three classes this
[1:48:50] throw down here until we just go on and
[1:48:52] on through the night explain it how it
[1:48:53] is everywhere you find you see them
[1:48:55] three
[1:48:56] always that way see you find them now
[1:48:59] watch these 70 they walked out because
[1:49:02] it didn't agree with what they believed
[1:49:04] to be right
[1:49:05] we haven't got no thought coming it's
[1:49:06] what he said
[1:49:08] you deny your own thinking you just say
[1:49:11] what he says that's really confession
[1:49:14] confession means to say the same thing
[1:49:16] if i confess that a certain thing takes
[1:49:18] place i say the same thing they're
[1:49:19] taking place that's what real confession
[1:49:22] is and he's the high priest of our
[1:49:23] confession
[1:49:25] saying the same thing god said see that
[1:49:27] makes it right because you're just
[1:49:29] repeating god's word now i notice the
[1:49:31] seventy walked out what did they do
[1:49:33] and they they went out just because they
[1:49:37] if they disagreed
[1:49:38] their their wisdom their church
[1:49:41] affiliation had was was too much that
[1:49:44] was too much for them to think that this
[1:49:45] man standing here that the all the rest
[1:49:47] of people believed that that was
[1:49:49] illegitimate barn he had no rights to
[1:49:51] call himself god and he was just a man
[1:49:54] said we don't stone you for a good work
[1:49:56] you do but we stone you because you
[1:49:58] being a man make yourself god and the
[1:49:59] word said he was god
[1:50:02] his name shall be called counselor
[1:50:04] prince of peace the mighty god the
[1:50:06] everlasting father the very scriptures
[1:50:08] that they read the very day that they
[1:50:11] were singing the psalm the 22nd psalm my
[1:50:13] god my god why is that forsaking me all
[1:50:16] my bones they stare at me not one bone
[1:50:18] shall be broken the very song that they
[1:50:20] were repeating in the temple they hung
[1:50:22] the sacrifice screaming the very words
[1:50:24] that david said 800 years before and was
[1:50:26] too blind to see it
[1:50:28] and today the very god that spoke of
[1:50:31] this age
[1:50:32] is on the scene doing exactly what he
[1:50:34] said he would do and they're too blind
[1:50:36] to see it that's unbelievers
[1:50:39] they'll walk out so i can't do stuff
[1:50:41] like that i've never heard of that in my
[1:50:42] life don't make hinders watch you here
[1:50:44] the bible said it would be here it says
[1:50:46] word they never heard of that either but
[1:50:48] it was there just the same
[1:50:50] that's right they were unbelievers just
[1:50:52] like eve was she was very religious of
[1:50:54] course so but she
[1:50:56] she did not believe the true word and
[1:50:58] she had to make herself a religion so
[1:51:00] she made some fig leaves see but it
[1:51:02] wouldn't work religion means a covering
[1:51:05] the same thing
[1:51:07] kane couldn't believe that that was
[1:51:08] right he said god is holy
[1:51:11] god is pure
[1:51:12] and god is beautiful
[1:51:14] so i will get me some flowers
[1:51:18] and i'll take the the flowers and i'll
[1:51:20] make a fine great altar
[1:51:22] and i'll i'll show my reverence to him
[1:51:25] i'll get up before it now bow down
[1:51:27] before him and worship that god and i'll
[1:51:29] put flowers on the altar because you
[1:51:31] know my father and mother eat some
[1:51:33] apples some fruit in the garden of eden
[1:51:36] and that's the thing that brought me out
[1:51:38] and so that's i will go back because
[1:51:39] i'll make it beautiful god just can't
[1:51:41] turn my big cathedral down
[1:51:43] well i'll beat you bigger a cathedral
[1:51:45] i'll make it so pretty so it'll attract
[1:51:47] god's attention
[1:51:49] satan's the one who dwells in beauty
[1:51:51] amen
[1:51:52] that's exactly what the scripture says
[1:51:54] that's right that's the reason sometimes
[1:51:56] a pretty woman is a bait for satan if he
[1:51:58] just get a hold of her he can twist more
[1:52:01] man into hell he could with all the bar
[1:52:02] rooms in the country
[1:52:05] or handsome some great handsome man that
[1:52:07] wouldn't stand up at his trueness of
[1:52:09] manhood see again he could swing that
[1:52:13] women to the devil and just sent him to
[1:52:15] hell yes sir notice satan dwells in
[1:52:19] beauty what did he try to do in the
[1:52:20] beginning make a more beautiful kingdom
[1:52:22] than michael's was moved over in the
[1:52:24] north and took two-thirds of the angels
[1:52:26] with see who's whose son that was and
[1:52:28] that nature any
[1:52:30] satan's son
[1:52:31] certainly was now he built the altar and
[1:52:34] he knelt down and he worshipped he went
[1:52:35] through everything that came and enabled
[1:52:37] him but abel knew that it wasn't that he
[1:52:40] was blood that took him out he knew that
[1:52:43] that was it it was the sex blood so he
[1:52:45] took a little animal and offered it up
[1:52:47] on a rock and chop his neck
[1:52:49] notice
[1:52:50] kane
[1:52:52] he god told him he said why don't you
[1:52:54] worship like your brother and you'll do
[1:52:56] all right you'll do well if you'll do
[1:52:58] that but know he know too much about it
[1:53:01] he rejected the original um
[1:53:04] vindicated word
[1:53:07] if that ain't his children today
[1:53:09] see
[1:53:10] now look
[1:53:13] god had testified the bible said hebrews
[1:53:16] the 4th chapter or the 11th chapter
[1:53:18] god testifying of his gift that he was
[1:53:20] righteous
[1:53:21] god vindicated his offering
[1:53:24] god made proof that that was what he
[1:53:26] accepted that was his word
[1:53:29] his plan
[1:53:31] and told cain said do the same thing and
[1:53:34] live
[1:53:35] but do you think he'd
[1:53:36] he would forfeit his idea
[1:53:39] no sir he was an unbeliever
[1:53:41] he walked right out that's right cain
[1:53:43] did the same thing nimrod did the same
[1:53:46] thing
[1:53:47] unbelievers
[1:53:48] he did not believe
[1:53:51] built a seizure the same thing though
[1:53:54] our nebuchadnezzar
[1:53:56] though having a daniel as his god called
[1:53:58] him delta seizure which was the name of
[1:54:00] his god
[1:54:01] saw daniel do the great works of god and
[1:54:04] then he knowed it built a seizure belief
[1:54:06] or that daniel was a god so he made an
[1:54:10] image to him
[1:54:12] and put it up out there and made
[1:54:13] everybody to worship it and so forth see
[1:54:15] the gentile came to come in with forcing
[1:54:19] of the worship of the image of a holy
[1:54:21] man and the gentile kingdom goes out
[1:54:24] with the forcing of the image of a holy
[1:54:26] man
[1:54:28] same way and there was a handwriting on
[1:54:30] the wall of unknown tongues at the
[1:54:32] beginning of the gentile kingdom that no
[1:54:35] one could read by that prophet and
[1:54:36] there's a handwriting on the wall today
[1:54:39] that's right ichabod that the glory of
[1:54:42] god has departed from them things
[1:54:44] and the handwriting's on the wall he'll
[1:54:47] be read by the spiritual mind amen
[1:54:50] that believes in spiritual things he's
[1:54:52] been born of the spirit of god
[1:54:56] old belted caesar goes out and gets
[1:54:58] these
[1:54:58] uh vessels of the lord to drink wine and
[1:55:01] why he was an unbeliever
[1:55:03] he thought he was a believer but he was
[1:55:04] an unbeliever
[1:55:05] see that's it he disbelieved the word
[1:55:08] ahab
[1:55:09] he was an unbeliever though he he he act
[1:55:12] like he wasn't no no he was amongst the
[1:55:14] believers but he was an unbeliever what
[1:55:16] did he do he married an idolatrous and
[1:55:19] brought idolatry right into israel he
[1:55:21] was an unbeliever we know that they deny
[1:55:25] the whole of the word of god to be true
[1:55:28] the unbeliever is you know remember he's
[1:55:31] a hypocrite
[1:55:32] and he he acts like that he says he
[1:55:35] believes it
[1:55:36] but he denies it he said well so much of
[1:55:40] it is well
[1:55:41] but if all of it isn't right then that
[1:55:43] makes him an unbeliever you've got to
[1:55:45] believe every tittle and every shot and
[1:55:47] everything that's said in there
[1:55:50] it's got to be true
[1:55:51] if it isn't true if you say no i don't
[1:55:53] believe that well then you're an
[1:55:54] unbeliever amen as a guy said to me one
[1:55:57] time a minister said i don't care mr
[1:56:00] branham how many people you could
[1:56:01] produce that that you said was healed i
[1:56:04] wouldn't believe it i said certainly not
[1:56:07] you can't believe it you're an
[1:56:08] unbeliever it wasn't for you it's only
[1:56:11] for the believers
[1:56:12] you've got to believe it
[1:56:14] see and they do not believe it so when
[1:56:17] you see a person that well did paul
[1:56:19] speak of the prophet saying that to be
[1:56:21] heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:56:22] more than lovers of god having forms of
[1:56:25] godliness but denying the power of the
[1:56:27] power of the word
[1:56:28] from such turn away notice they deny the
[1:56:31] holy word but in every form very
[1:56:33] religious
[1:56:34] they are unbelievers in the true word
[1:56:37] though it be vindicated all through
[1:56:39] every age god vindicated the word of
[1:56:41] these people i've talked about noah on
[1:56:43] down to moses and all the prophets and
[1:56:45] forth
[1:56:46] god spoke to the supernatural
[1:56:49] and vindicated the word and yet those
[1:56:51] people walked right out on it here's
[1:56:53] these disciples standing there them 70
[1:56:55] and watching jesus do the things that he
[1:56:57] didn't know the scripture him telling
[1:56:59] him that that was the age that this was
[1:57:00] to take place and then when he said
[1:57:02] something the son of man what would you
[1:57:04] say when he began to tell him about
[1:57:06] breaking the bread and so forth and when
[1:57:07] i had to tell him about great spiritual
[1:57:09] things and they said oh this is a hard
[1:57:11] saying he said what are you going to say
[1:57:13] then if the son of man you see him
[1:57:15] ascend up into heaven where he come from
[1:57:18] said is it the flesh or is it the spirit
[1:57:20] that quickened see and then they moved
[1:57:22] away saw that i can't believe that see
[1:57:24] they walk right out on the word they
[1:57:26] won't even stay to see what takes place
[1:57:29] that is the that is the unbeliever
[1:57:33] they what do they do then we find out
[1:57:35] that they that these people these uh
[1:57:38] believers as so-called believers
[1:57:41] but in forms of religion and they fail
[1:57:43] to see the identified truth of the word
[1:57:46] of god because it's against
[1:57:49] what they believe
[1:57:50] see don't make any difference what you
[1:57:52] believe how loyal you are how religious
[1:57:54] you are and that doesn't have one thing
[1:57:57] to do to it
[1:58:00] sincerity well that don't have nothing
[1:58:01] to do with it
[1:58:03] i've seen people so sincere i seen the
[1:58:06] heathens burn their children feed them
[1:58:08] to the crocodiles mothers with their
[1:58:10] babies that's more than a christian to
[1:58:11] do
[1:58:13] sincerely they believe sincerely but for
[1:58:16] sincerely wrong
[1:58:18] people say well this church is
[1:58:20] you're sincerely wrong if it's contrary
[1:58:22] to the word
[1:58:24] well i look i don't believe in such
[1:58:26] thing well the bible said it was so old
[1:58:29] i don't believe it we have to do this i
[1:58:31] don't care what you think you don't have
[1:58:32] to do god said it must be done these
[1:58:34] signs shall follow them
[1:58:37] how far to all the world who to every
[1:58:39] creature
[1:58:41] it shall be all right i shall be it's
[1:58:43] gonna be in this message of the hour
[1:58:46] that we're now enjoying the presence of
[1:58:48] god the latter day the evening time when
[1:58:51] the lights are shining and the things
[1:58:53] has been opened up and the word
[1:58:55] vindicated and proved to be the truth
[1:58:57] both prophesied comes to pass
[1:58:59] all through scientific and everything
[1:59:01] proves
[1:59:02] that it is jesus christ the same
[1:59:04] yesterday and forever and a man walked
[1:59:06] out on that
[1:59:08] he's he's an unbeliever
[1:59:10] he's beyond hopes he's known by the
[1:59:13] power of satan
[1:59:16] so there's no hopes for him he's beyond
[1:59:18] hopes now that is what the believer now
[1:59:21] the unbeliever now the third class we're
[1:59:24] speaking about is the make believer
[1:59:27] that's the boy
[1:59:29] the big believer i remember in there
[1:59:32] stood all three
[1:59:34] now we find out
[1:59:36] they do just exactly like their father
[1:59:39] does judas
[1:59:41] that was peter
[1:59:43] and the rest of the apostles believers
[1:59:45] there was a 70 unbelievers and there was
[1:59:48] judas hung right on
[1:59:50] he was a make-believer
[1:59:52] what do they do
[1:59:54] this is a kind uh holds on until they
[1:59:58] can find something of fault in it
[2:00:01] that's right
[2:00:02] they're looking every time to find a
[2:00:04] loophole
[2:00:05] see how it's done
[2:00:07] see if it's a trick
[2:00:08] if it's a gimmick
[2:00:10] they're waiting to be sold out they're
[2:00:12] looking for that the unbeliever he don't
[2:00:14] even wait around
[2:00:16] he's condemned it walked out the
[2:00:18] believer no matter what happens he
[2:00:20] believes it anyhow first word
[2:00:23] there's your three classes that's right
[2:00:25] the old unbeliever a walk out on the
[2:00:27] first thing it said he don't like about
[2:00:29] it brother he's going to show his colors
[2:00:31] right then he's an unbeliever
[2:00:33] paul said they went out from us because
[2:00:35] they wasn't of us in the beginning they
[2:00:37] started with us oh you did run well what
[2:00:40] energy
[2:00:42] they went out because it wasn't us when
[2:00:44] they see the word perfectly moving on
[2:00:46] well they want to get some kind of a
[2:00:48] gimmick they could work see but the real
[2:00:50] believers don't question nothing
[2:00:53] it's written in the word and they
[2:00:54] believe it and it's wrong
[2:00:57] that's it always it's written if it
[2:00:58] isn't written well you just stay away
[2:01:00] from no matter what happens it's got to
[2:01:02] be written see they see that written
[2:01:04] word they believe it and they see god
[2:01:06] moving in his word see the hour the
[2:01:08] message the time and they walk with it
[2:01:10] as it said this morning how old pilate
[2:01:12] must have walked the floor at night with
[2:01:14] his worried conscience trying to clean
[2:01:16] himself and he said my nobody called for
[2:01:19] the night so i i
[2:01:21] wash my hands all night
[2:01:23] and i still can't understand okay
[2:01:26] they're not clean
[2:01:27] i can never go to medium i've got blood
[2:01:30] up on my hands oh my
[2:01:32] don't never be guilty of that see it's
[2:01:34] on your hands the only one way you can
[2:01:36] get out that's accepted
[2:01:38] that's right become part of it that's
[2:01:40] what it was shed for
[2:01:42] now
[2:01:43] the make-believer hangs around and acts
[2:01:45] just as pious as he can but down in his
[2:01:48] heart he's trying to find what's what
[2:01:51] you how you do it
[2:01:53] oh
[2:01:54] if the country isn't full of that part
[2:01:56] of hypocrites
[2:01:58] that's a judas
[2:01:59] that's exactly hangs around becomes part
[2:02:02] of the group he was a treasure see he
[2:02:05] stands around he's always got his hand
[2:02:07] out for money you can tell that one
[2:02:08] thing he's always fishing for money and
[2:02:11] got his hand out for this and he is a
[2:02:14] make-believer he acts like a believer
[2:02:16] but down in his hearts remember he
[2:02:17] wasn't fooling jesus
[2:02:19] after the seventy left
[2:02:21] and the believers made their stand and
[2:02:23] he turned around to the believers he
[2:02:25] said there's still something in you
[2:02:28] for said i've chose twelve and one of
[2:02:30] these the devil
[2:02:31] jesus know from the beginning where he
[2:02:33] was the word
[2:02:34] he know the secret of the heart how hard
[2:02:37] it was
[2:02:39] stop a minute
[2:02:40] think deep long straight yes
[2:02:44] how hard it must have been on him
[2:02:46] walking right there and a man calling
[2:02:47] him brother note all the time that that
[2:02:48] was the deceiver that was going to try
[2:02:50] to upset him and sell him for 30 pieces
[2:02:51] of silver
[2:02:53] how hard he was to hold him his bosom
[2:02:56] and his friend walking longer even he
[2:02:58] said friend call judas his friend
[2:03:02] have not been with you all this time
[2:03:04] knowing in his heart and couldn't say it
[2:03:06] he know from the beginning who it was
[2:03:08] that would betray you
[2:03:10] there's that make-believer
[2:03:12] that's just waiting you're saying i said
[2:03:14] oh i believe this and i believe this i

[2:03:28] looking for no loopholes he ain't
[2:03:29] looking for no gimmicks he believes god
[2:03:32] and that settles it and it just keeps
[2:03:33] going on
[2:03:34] see there's a believer the unbeliever
[2:03:37] fills up in a minute he can't stay to
[2:03:38] listen 10 minutes to the message he's
[2:03:40] got to get walk out it's against his
[2:03:42] creed and he just won't have more to do
[2:03:43] with it so he goes out

[2:03:47] that judas
[2:03:49] that's a deceiver that's a that's a
[2:03:50] rascal if i have to say such a word

[2:07:58] between you and god you wrote your doom
[2:08:00] right on your card
[2:08:03] and that got him that was all of it
[2:08:06] see
[2:08:08] make believers
[2:08:10] deceivers
[2:08:12] trying to find some fault with god in
[2:08:14] his word
[2:08:16] that's the judases
[2:08:18] that's the ones you see how judas come
[2:08:19] out
[2:08:20] see all that guy come out
[2:08:22] that's the way to make believers happen
[2:08:24] make believers all highly educated
[2:08:27] sometimes a great showdown comes between
[2:08:31] the word
[2:08:32] and their creed and when it does
[2:08:34] they sell out to their denomination just
[2:08:37] exactly like their forerunner did judas
[2:08:41] judas sold out to his denomination sold
[2:08:44] jesus the word to his denomination and
[2:08:47] betrayed jesus christ actually claimed
[2:08:49] to be a part of it ministers sometimes
[2:08:51] claiming to be servants of christ and
[2:08:54] when the word is thoroughly identified
[2:08:56] to be vindicated for that day that it is
[2:08:58] the message of the hour and they'll sell
[2:09:02] their for popularity to their
[2:09:03] denomination
[2:09:05] just exactly like judas did betrayed
[2:09:07] jesus to the pharisees and sadducees
[2:09:10] that spirit don't die so there that's
[2:09:12] amongst the believers make believers and
[2:09:14] unbelievers see that's just exact come
[2:09:17] right down and sold jesus for 30 pieces
[2:09:19] of silver and many man will do it today
[2:09:22] for a meal ticket for an extra hundred
[2:09:23] dollars a week hallelujah
[2:09:25] deny the god they're standing in the
[2:09:27] midst of them and bought their life and
[2:09:28] with the full word and they'll say all
[2:09:30] them days of miracles is pastor god
[2:09:32] don't need such a thing as that today
[2:09:34] see oh i believe in jesus christ the son
[2:09:36] of god hail mary and mother of god
[2:09:38] blessed art thou amongst women all these
[2:09:41] other things they're saying some of them
[2:09:42] said i believe in the apostles creed i
[2:09:44] believe in god the father almighty
[2:09:46] creator of heaven is there being the
[2:09:47] holy roman catholic church and all these
[2:09:48] things tell me one apostle ever had a
[2:09:50] creed like that
[2:09:51] if the apostles had one creed it's wrote
[2:09:53] in acts 2 38
[2:09:55] and be baptized
[2:09:56] in the name of jesus christ for the
[2:09:58] remission of sins and you shall receive
[2:10:00] the gift of the holy ghost if there's
[2:10:02] any creed to them that was it they had
[2:10:04] no creed it was a word
[2:10:06] that is true it still remains the same
[2:10:08] that's a prescription for the cure of
[2:10:10] the disease of sin and you shall receive
[2:10:13] the gift of the holy ghost repent be
[2:10:15] baptized for the remission of sins
[2:10:18] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[2:10:19] ghost but they sell out like judas
[2:10:21] that's the make-believer
[2:10:24] some of them are highly talented people
[2:10:27] and this make believer watch that guy
[2:10:29] that's the shrewd guy this little guy
[2:10:31] fills up quick and jumps up and runs out
[2:10:32] of every little phrase that he don't
[2:10:34] like you don't pay attention to him he's
[2:10:35] just an unbeliever to begin with
[2:10:37] but when you see this guy make believer
[2:10:39] hangs on see that's the judas that's him
[2:10:42] like great talents
[2:10:45] i'm going to call names here which i
[2:10:47] really shouldn't do it but i'm going to
[2:10:48] call them anyhow so what you'll know it
[2:10:50] like elvis presley
[2:10:53] red foley
[2:10:55] ernie ford
[2:10:57] pat boone
[2:10:58] elvis presley a pentecostal pat boone a
[2:11:01] church of christ
[2:11:03] red foley a deacon in the church of
[2:11:05] christ now i think ernest ford is a
[2:11:07] methodist
[2:11:09] and all those people are those talents
[2:11:12] smart i don't television if people say
[2:11:15] well aren't they religious they sing
[2:11:16] songs that don't mean one thing amen
[2:11:21] deceiving the world
[2:11:23] what do they get out of it judith's got
[2:11:24] 30 pieces of silver elvis a fleet of
[2:11:27] cadillacs and 100 or 250 million dollars
[2:11:30] or a million dollars on records and
[2:11:31] things like that pat boone and the rest
[2:11:33] of them i don't care what church they
[2:11:34] belong to and everything it's hypocrisy
[2:11:37] it's a make-believe it's a front
[2:11:40] that their life proves out that isn't
[2:11:42] right right then there are those with
[2:11:45] the talents that
[2:11:46] it's great organizers worldly wisdom
[2:11:50] they preach the gospel claim to smart
[2:11:53] man intellectuals
[2:11:54] listen a man that's trained in that
[2:11:57] field he is not a preacher he's a
[2:11:59] lecturer
[2:12:00] that's what's in trouble today we have
[2:12:02] lectures jesus never said go and train
[2:12:04] to do this is a go preach the gospel and
[2:12:07] these signs shall follow the preaching
[2:12:11] that's not to learn to make a lecture
[2:12:13] who can stand and just ma put them
[2:12:15] flowerly things in it make you feel like
[2:12:17] you're sitting right in the presence of
[2:12:18] an archangel that isn't it having forms
[2:12:21] of god in this thing that's a lecture
[2:12:24] not the holy spirit in action some
[2:12:26] little fellow would know his abcs but
[2:12:29] come down with the power of faith with
[2:12:30] the word and make the holy spirit do
[2:12:32] things that man knows nothing about
[2:12:33] tonight
[2:12:35] there you are great people yes sir then
[2:12:38] there are organizers they're prosperous
[2:12:40] successful smart and worldly wisdom just
[2:12:43] exactly like satan did to eve
[2:12:47] little helpless woman he came right to
[2:12:50] her and tried to sell her on the idea
[2:12:52] that she'd be wiser than what she was
[2:12:54] and that's what she's looking for
[2:12:55] instead of staying right what the word
[2:12:57] said
[2:12:58] he wanted to sell her on the idea she'd
[2:13:00] be wiser and she bought his product and
[2:13:02] they still do the same thing today the
[2:13:04] wisdom of this world is foolish to god
[2:13:08] yes sir
[2:13:09] uh sir oh my
[2:13:11] just the same thing that the pharisees
[2:13:14] sold out and did see with their wisdom
[2:13:16] if they know but
[2:13:17] but deny the whole word of god when it's
[2:13:20] properly been proven and it's been
[2:13:23] vindicated them they
[2:13:25] still try to find something and think
[2:13:26] it's a gimmick they're not settled in
[2:13:28] their mind they can't believe it you
[2:13:29] tell them anything and they're back
[2:13:30] again you tell them anything they're
[2:13:32] back again and they just you can't get
[2:13:34] soaked in you see and watch them they're
[2:13:35] watching for a time just a loophole
[2:13:38] that's all they want that's what if it
[2:13:39] hadn't been for the grace of god all my
[2:13:42] loopholes had been exposed if i had
[2:13:44] anything it's a grace of god because
[2:13:46] there's no loopholes in the word of god
[2:13:48] this straight gospel i've always said
[2:13:50] anybody if you see me teach or do
[2:13:52] anything it's not exactly what the word
[2:13:54] of god you come tell me
[2:13:56] here's the thing that covers the
[2:13:58] loopholes that you're trying to find
[2:13:59] just put your eyes on that you'll see no
[2:14:01] loopholes because there's no loopholes
[2:14:03] now remember judas thought he found one
[2:14:06] that fellow thought he found one many
[2:14:08] times they think they find it but it
[2:14:10] proves out that it's not that's some
[2:14:12] make believers
[2:14:13] hypocrites
[2:14:15] there are 95 on the word so is eve
[2:14:18] but 99 and 9 10 but is that one tenth
[2:14:22] that cause all death and sorrow that's
[2:14:24] the one thing that condemns the
[2:14:25] organization things because they don't
[2:14:27] take the whole word of god
[2:14:30] that's the make-believers we find has
[2:14:32] always been but deny the true vindicated
[2:14:35] word these are always in each generation
[2:14:37] we find a message to go along and also
[2:14:39] very religious now i'm fixing to close
[2:14:41] right now because it doesn't take
[2:14:43] another half hour
[2:14:44] jesus
[2:14:46] we find out that he has warned us
[2:14:49] against these last days and these kind
[2:14:51] of people that these be so much like the
[2:14:54] real thing that they would absolutely
[2:14:56] would deceive the very elected ones what
[2:14:59] is that that's the judases
[2:15:01] the the people that go so far up look
[2:15:04] they they even can cry
[2:15:06] shout claim to cast our devils
[2:15:09] everything
[2:15:10] and then turn back around and deny the
[2:15:13] word
[2:15:15] exactly
[2:15:17] they have a form of validness that
[2:15:20] that almost look at where judas came
[2:15:23] judah's spirit climbed into the gospel
[2:15:26] up to the place of pentecost
[2:15:29] but when he come to the time for his
[2:15:31] baptism in the name of jesus christ
[2:15:34] and these other things that goes with
[2:15:35] the baptism the holy ghost he walked out
[2:15:38] he showed his colors and that spirit can
[2:15:40] live in those denominations until it
[2:15:41] gets right to that truth that's right
[2:15:43] then she drops right back
[2:15:45] like the spirit that's on them that four
[2:15:47] run
[2:15:48] they're coming just as john 4 runs jesus
[2:15:51] coming now you say jesus said they'd be
[2:15:54] so close now elected that's the kind
[2:15:57] that has had their name on the book from
[2:15:59] the foundation of life that please a
[2:16:00] foundation world that believes all the
[2:16:02] word of life that's the elected i watch
[2:16:05] these people not say this with forever
[2:16:07] send respect with godly love if i don't
[2:16:09] um i i need to order call myself
[2:16:13] notice
[2:16:15] jesus said they would deceive the very
[2:16:17] elected
[2:16:19] now that wouldn't be methodist
[2:16:22] that wouldn't be baptist
[2:16:24] we know they're unbelievers to begin
[2:16:25] with
[2:16:27] but it's pentecostals
[2:16:29] organization
[2:16:31] that took into that
[2:16:33] denomination
[2:16:35] draw their lines without the word and
[2:16:37] draw the line and put their own
[2:16:38] organization and fenced out the word
[2:16:42] they would deceive the very elected so
[2:16:45] perfectly alive
[2:16:46] say they cry they shout they jump up and
[2:16:48] down they claim healing services so did
[2:16:50] judas and so did all the rest of them
[2:16:52] when they went out come back rejoicing
[2:16:54] and everything and even had their names
[2:16:55] written in the lamb's book of mine
[2:16:57] but remember the bride don't
[2:16:59] don't come up in that group
[2:17:01] she goes in the rapture at the judgment
[2:17:03] the judgment was set and the books were
[2:17:05] open the wicked and another book which
[2:17:07] is the book of life it was open and
[2:17:09] there was a bride there to judge it
[2:17:12] another book was open which is the book
[2:17:13] of life that's the sheep on one side and
[2:17:16] the goats on the other
[2:17:17] see the people have died back out never
[2:17:19] had the opportunity they'll be the ones
[2:17:21] to be separated but now notice
[2:17:23] receive the very elected watch that
[2:17:26] group
[2:17:27] that's that group that follows right
[2:17:29] along yes brother
[2:17:31] hallelujah yes glory to god and right
[2:17:34] down in your hearts you see what they're
[2:17:36] working for
[2:17:38] have you church wife to draw a crowd to
[2:17:41] bleed them with every bit of money they
[2:17:42] can get out of it you think i don't know
[2:17:44] that
[2:17:44] they might not think i know it
[2:17:46] but i know it
[2:17:48] jesus no one from the beginning who was
[2:17:50] deceiver
[2:17:52] but what did he do he just waited till
[2:17:54] that time that's what we must always do
[2:17:57] wait till that time don't move in
[2:17:59] yourself wait till that minute
[2:18:02] having a farm and go right along that's
[2:18:05] that deceiving group
[2:18:07] watch that deceiver that group there not
[2:18:09] the not the believer not the unbeliever
[2:18:12] but that make believer
[2:18:14] oh my what are they doing just weeding
[2:18:17] along until they think they can find
[2:18:19] something
[2:18:20] pulling every penny that they can out of
[2:18:22] the people they
[2:18:23] that pile it up in these great big
[2:18:25] organizations which are absolutely
[2:18:26] against and they know it that's why
[2:18:29] they know it
[2:18:30] don't make any watches say they've
[2:18:32] always warned their people before you
[2:18:34] come don't listen to it one man with the
[2:18:36] audacity to stand there and oh hi now
[2:18:38] just when brother kid was healed come
[2:18:40] out there on the platform he said now
[2:18:42] brother branham is a prophet no doubt at
[2:18:44] all when he's under the anointing but
[2:18:45] now i said when the anointing is off of
[2:18:48] him said don't you believe he's teaching
[2:18:49] because it's wrong and he didn't know
[2:18:51] it's set in my room the lord revealed it
[2:18:53] to me and i walked right down there many
[2:18:54] of his air i said why would a man say a
[2:18:57] thing like that
[2:18:58] when the word now see i never said i was
[2:19:01] a prophet he said it
[2:19:03] and the prophet the word prophet seer
[2:19:06] old test now the english version of
[2:19:07] prophet means a preacher
[2:19:09] but the old testament seer was a man who
[2:19:12] had the divine interpretation of the
[2:19:14] word and was proven by the word coming
[2:19:16] to him before seeing it
[2:19:20] was what in a man
[2:19:21] saying that a man be a prophet and then
[2:19:23] saying his teachings wrong
[2:19:25] a failing a money working scheme what is
[2:19:29] the hour's close at hand when that thing
[2:19:31] will be pulled out on the scene
[2:19:33] but that's the kind that that
[2:19:36] make-believer
[2:19:38] had you on the back call your brother
[2:19:40] just a judas but remember he knowed from
[2:19:42] the beginning he still knows

[2:19:48] tape too that's right
[2:19:50] you're in one of them classes
[2:19:53] that's exactly right
[2:19:54] now we're going to clouds
[2:19:56] every person is here present
[2:19:59] every person that listens to this tape
[2:20:02] and even though someday i have to leave

[2:20:13] exactly you can't escape it you're in
[2:20:15] one of these places that's right
[2:20:18] what

[2:20:22] that believed
[2:20:23] where you believed the word when it was
[2:20:25] a vindicated like i proved it tonight
[2:20:26] that it was a vindicated word always
[2:20:30] contrary to the popular belief
[2:20:33] if you should live in the days of noah
[2:20:36] let me say what side would you been on
[2:20:39] the church side or no aside the prophet
[2:20:42] see if you'd lived in the days of moses
[2:20:45] would you have believed moses message
[2:20:47] after being proven and vindicated by god
[2:20:49] but would you went with core and death
[2:20:50] unto them and said you're not the only
[2:20:52] holy man other people can do these
[2:20:53] things that you do too
[2:20:55] you have to be one
[2:20:57] and you are tonight
[2:20:59] oh would you be with daniel or with the
[2:21:01] church that was down there at
[2:21:02] nebuchadnezzar's party is given
[2:21:05] see would you been outside or will you
[2:21:07] been down to shindig

[2:21:11] you have been with elijah that man
[2:21:13] standing on called an old crank a man
[2:21:15] lost his mind standing up on top of a
[2:21:17] hill head shining up there to the sun
[2:21:20] with a crooked stick in his hand the
[2:21:21] birds feeding
[2:21:23] some crank or would you bend the priest
[2:21:26] and all them down there with jezebel and
[2:21:28] the rest of them modern dressed women
[2:21:30] elijah stand up there rebuking him as
[2:21:31] hard as he could
[2:21:33] what part would you talk your wife to
[2:21:36] just think just picture yourself tonight
[2:21:39] in the days of jesus would you have been
[2:21:41] with this boy that had no credentials
[2:21:44] he had no denomination affiliations they
[2:21:47] said what school did you come from we
[2:21:49] don't have you on our record here
[2:21:51] how do you get this wisdom how did you
[2:21:52] ever learn if we didn't teach you these
[2:21:54] things what school did you come to are
[2:21:56] you methodist presbyterian or baptist he
[2:21:58] was none of it
[2:21:59] that's right
[2:22:00] he was the word that's exactly right
[2:22:02] brother the or would you tuck the side
[2:22:05] with the pharisees of the modern belief
[2:22:07] of the humble old priest that seemed to
[2:22:08] be so gentle and nice and the
[2:22:10] organization that stood up since the
[2:22:12] nazi council or since lutheran organizer
[2:22:14] what what group would you have been in
[2:22:16] would you bet them what group would you
[2:22:18] have been with would you stood with the
[2:22:19] word when you see it to vindicate it and
[2:22:21] proved to you it was a message of the
[2:22:22] day or would you have took the church
[2:22:24] stand now just picture yourself tonight
[2:22:26] would you have been there with the
[2:22:28] apostles
[2:22:29] when they
[2:22:30] seen jesus and all these mysterious
[2:22:32] things when he cried out
[2:22:34] preachers said you're a nest of snakes
[2:22:38] them honest old preachers
[2:22:40] studied that word
[2:22:42] said you're nothing but a den of thieves
[2:22:44] and you're you're full of dead man's
[2:22:46] bones you're nothing but a white wall
[2:22:50] use generation of vipers
[2:22:53] would you stood with a hot-headed fellow
[2:22:55] like that who stood there and rebuked
[2:22:57] and tore down and said which one of you
[2:22:59] can accuse me of sin if i do not what
[2:23:00] the father said they said don't listen
[2:23:02] that guy's got an evil spirit on him
[2:23:03] he's crazy
[2:23:05] he's mad he's he's got a spirit of the
[2:23:06] devil on him see now that how he does
[2:23:08] that he that's a fortune teller spirit
[2:23:10] him you tell what is he his mother had
[2:23:12] him before her and her husband was
[2:23:14] married
[2:23:15] yeah
[2:23:16] see
[2:23:17] what school did he come to we don't even
[2:23:18] have one record of ever going to grammar
[2:23:20] school
[2:23:21] and yet when he was 12 years old he
[2:23:23] stouted and confound the priest with the
[2:23:26] word of god
[2:23:27] what school did he come out of the
[2:23:29] school of above
[2:23:31] when you see the son of man descending
[2:23:32] up from where he come from
[2:23:34] that was his school
[2:23:36] but would you stick with the apostles to
[2:23:37] a man like that when the showdown come
[2:23:40] or would you actually walked off with
[2:23:42] the seven and said well we'll go on back
[2:23:43] to our church if that's the way you're
[2:23:45] going to teach
[2:23:46] saying you the son of man when after all
[2:23:49] who are you what are you a man like i am
[2:23:51] i ain't with you i'm trying to say
[2:23:53] you're something
[2:23:54] i've watched you have seen your weakness
[2:23:56] i've seen you cry i've seen you do this
[2:23:58] or the other i see you go in the
[2:23:59] wilderness with us and everything else
[2:24:01] like that now you're just a man and say
[2:24:02] you come down from heaven that's too
[2:24:04] much for me
[2:24:05] would you walk up with him or would you
[2:24:07] have walked out with a 70 or would you
[2:24:09] walked on with the apostles and cries
[2:24:11] when saint martin
[2:24:13] tried to hold the baptism in the name of
[2:24:15] jesus christ in the church
[2:24:17] when he still tried to hold to signs and
[2:24:20] wonders and things and the catholic
[2:24:22] church condemned the man
[2:24:24] and wouldn't even recognize him at all
[2:24:26] and cast him out
[2:24:28] would you took the place
[2:24:30] what the catholic creator would just do
[2:24:32] with saint martin
[2:24:34] when he refused to put up all these kind
[2:24:36] of images of dead people and worship him
[2:24:38] worship them images and so forth when he
[2:24:41] refused the dogmas it was added he said
[2:24:43] let the word be truth
[2:24:45] god vindicated him the great signs and
[2:24:47] wonders and what he foretold happened
[2:24:50] everything that he did he walked in the
[2:24:51] spirit of god and proved and one one of
[2:24:53] them priests or anything could do
[2:24:55] anything about it
[2:24:56] would you have took his sign and went
[2:24:58] with saint martin or would you went with
[2:25:00] a catholic creed
[2:25:02] now
[2:25:03] the word
[2:25:05] now the word of god or the church dogmas
[2:25:09] is before you
[2:25:10] can you take except what the dog was the
[2:25:12] church or do you take what the word says
[2:25:14] remember in all ages
[2:25:16] has been as it is right now
[2:25:20] there's always a proper belief among the
[2:25:22] people and it's always been at least a
[2:25:24] little bit contrary to the real word
[2:25:28] remember it's never been just to run out
[2:25:30] deny it oh no the antichrist don't deny
[2:25:33] the word certainly not
[2:25:35] he says he believes it but just not all
[2:25:37] of it the way it's wrote here
[2:25:40] see satan told eve he bleeded all but
[2:25:42] just that little bitty he told her they
[2:25:44] take us all over this little bit might
[2:25:46] be go to pool
[2:25:47] it might be something else you got to
[2:25:49] take it every bit just the way it is
[2:25:51] here amen just the way it said here
[2:25:53] my cause should do some first works over
[2:25:55] again but it's just what the word said
[2:25:58] this has been satan's trick
[2:26:00] since he worked at first on e just to
[2:26:03] disbelieve a little bit of the words and
[2:26:06] always
[2:26:08] uh separates
[2:26:10] these three classes of people the word
[2:26:13] separates these people
[2:26:15] and every age it's been that way
[2:26:18] every age that ever has been has been
[2:26:20] that way when god sent something on the
[2:26:22] scene that clearly identifies at his
[2:26:25] word
[2:26:26] then there are those that follow that
[2:26:28] claim to be believers and they are
[2:26:30] there are those that wouldn't turn back
[2:26:32] they believe the word as long as it's
[2:26:33] staying word they believe it but when it
[2:26:35] comes a little contrary oh my god
[2:26:37] identifies it for what they believe they
[2:26:39] say well i i don't know about that
[2:26:41] that's the unbeliever or do you follow
[2:26:43] along just to see each other you can get
[2:26:45] a chance say
[2:26:47] here you are
[2:26:48] a judas to stab somebody in the back
[2:26:50] like he did
[2:26:52] i know it would come out sooner or later
[2:26:54] there you are
[2:26:56] that's the make-believer
[2:26:58] every every bit of it we see it in the
[2:27:01] bible a little boy one time down here in
[2:27:03] kentucky raised way up in the mountains
[2:27:06] it had never been around where he was a
[2:27:07] looking glass he had a little piece
[2:27:09] tacked up on a tree but he had never
[2:27:10] seen himself
[2:27:11] he come here to louisville it was told
[2:27:13] to
[2:27:14] stay with his mother's sister and she
[2:27:16] lived in one of the nice homes the
[2:27:18] old-fashioned home and it went into the
[2:27:20] one of the uh
[2:27:22] bedrooms that had a a door that had a
[2:27:24] mare all up all the way up and down the
[2:27:26] door see and when the little fella
[2:27:28] started running through the house he
[2:27:29] stopped
[2:27:30] little johnny saw a little johnny
[2:27:33] and he scratched his head and little
[2:27:35] johnny in the mirror scratched his head
[2:27:37] he laughed a little johnny in the mirror
[2:27:39] laughed
[2:27:40] he jumped up and down little johnny
[2:27:42] jumped up and down in the mirror see
[2:27:44] he walked up real close he saw his
[2:27:46] little boy he could play with so i
[2:27:47] walked up directly pecked on the glass
[2:27:50] he'd carry on his parents was watching
[2:27:52] he said mama that's me
[2:27:55] now you look at this and which is you
[2:27:59] hey man
[2:28:01] hey which one of these little johnnies
[2:28:03] are you impersonating which ones you see
[2:28:05] you're one of them
[2:28:07] that's one of them one that would turn
[2:28:08] back the first flaw you found that you
[2:28:11] call the flaw
[2:28:13] test it with the word and see if it's
[2:28:14] right that's right if the word proves
[2:28:16] all things see prove all things for the
[2:28:18] word jesus said do so
[2:28:20] yes sir hold fast that what's good
[2:28:22] that's exactly what he said now look in
[2:28:24] the mirror of god's word in the other
[2:28:27] ages
[2:28:28] and see which group of these three that
[2:28:30] should be identified and i just think if
[2:28:32] you live in the days of noah if you live
[2:28:33] in the days of moses if you live in the
[2:28:35] days of jesus or one of them whatever it
[2:28:37] is just think what group you'd be
[2:28:39] identified with think of it tonight
[2:28:41] then
[2:28:43] you're present now just think now this
[2:28:45] is deep now and don't run over the top
[2:28:48] of it your present
[2:28:51] state
[2:28:52] right now proves to you what group you'd
[2:28:54] have been with back there
[2:28:57] now you're your own judges
[2:29:01] proves what you are
[2:29:02] forever minister
[2:29:04] what group would you have been with
[2:29:06] when jesus made that statement it's hard
[2:29:08] to believe
[2:29:10] what what actually had thoroughly been
[2:29:12] identified if he was the word
[2:29:14] and yet that statement you never heard
[2:29:16] of anything like that the son of man
[2:29:17] what would you say if he be ascends up
[2:29:20] into heaven where he come from and you
[2:29:22] said well i know where he was born that
[2:29:25] i know his papa know his mama and here
[2:29:28] he says he's going to send up where he
[2:29:29] come from
[2:29:31] that'd been a little too much for you
[2:29:32] wouldn't sir
[2:29:35] been just a little bit too much for you
[2:29:37] cut the stomach there
[2:29:38] maybe it's the same thing today then
[2:29:40] look in the glass of god's word and see
[2:29:41] where you stand amen
[2:29:44] oh
[2:29:44] deceiver of man
[2:29:46] you never do that
[2:29:48] look you're one of these classes in your
[2:29:50] present state right now the present
[2:29:52] state of mind that you hear in this
[2:29:54] visible audience and you that'll be in
[2:29:56] the invisible audience of this tape your
[2:29:58] present state of mind after listening to
[2:30:00] this state proves to you what class
[2:30:03] you're in
[2:30:05] it tells you exactly where you are
[2:30:08] whether you are a believer
[2:30:11] in the word and will stay with it
[2:30:12] whether you walked out or shut that tape
[2:30:15] off
[2:30:17] that tells what you do that's right you
[2:30:19] don't want to listen to it and shut us i
[2:30:20] don't want to listen that that's that
[2:30:22] unbelievable
[2:30:23] you won't stop to test it and see if
[2:30:25] it's truth or not see
[2:30:27] or just hanging around and trying to
[2:30:29] find some fault with it
[2:30:31] then you know where you are too it tells
[2:30:33] you
[2:30:34] god help us to believe it and stand on
[2:30:37] it and be loyal to it and obey the word
[2:30:40] for he is the world
[2:30:42] you believe in
[2:30:44] amen let us pray
[2:31:03] amen
[2:31:04] praise the lord
[2:31:06] three kinds of believers
[2:31:09] have you determined which one you are
[2:31:12] amen
[2:31:13] so are we the believers the
[2:31:15] make-believer the unbeliever which is
[2:31:17] amazing he said there are all three of
[2:31:19] them in aryan church
[2:31:22] you would think that maybe the
[2:31:23] unbeliever is outside but no he's part
[2:31:26] he's part of the group amen
[2:31:29] that god is not what man sees is what
[2:31:31] god sees
[2:31:33] amen
[2:31:34] so it's not me looking at you and say
[2:31:35] that that's a believer or that's a
[2:31:37] make-believer that's an unbeliever well
[2:31:40] what does god see amen we leave that
[2:31:42] with the lord by the grace of god
[2:31:46] and again he said
[2:31:48] now he said just think
[2:31:50] he said this is deep
[2:31:52] and don't run over the top of it your
[2:31:54] present state right now proves to you
[2:31:57] what group you have been with
[2:31:59] back there
[2:32:00] now is that you your you are your own
[2:32:03] judge
[2:32:04] proves what you are
[2:32:06] and he said look he said you're one of
[2:32:08] these classes
[2:32:10] and your present state right now
[2:32:13] the present state of mind that you
[2:32:15] that you hear in this visible audience
[2:32:18] and he said you that'll be in the
[2:32:20] invisible audience of this tape your
[2:32:23] present state of mind after listening to
[2:32:25] this tape proves to you he said what
[2:32:28] class you're in
[2:32:30] amen

[2:32:55] sermons they recorded no no it's still
[2:32:58] the word of god
[2:33:00] and it's a challenge to our faith
[2:33:03] amen
[2:33:05] whether it's the message here trying to
[2:33:06] do god a service without it being god's
[2:33:08] will
[2:33:09] amen
[2:33:11] or the restoration of the bright tree

[2:35:42] beginning and the end
[2:35:44] and are all in between by the grace of
[2:35:46] god
[2:35:47] amen
[2:35:49] so grace again
[2:35:51] again as he said you're one of these
[2:35:53] classes amen
[2:35:55] and your present state
[2:35:57] and present state of mind
[2:35:59] that you are here in this visible
[2:36:01] audience that you you that'll be in the
[2:36:04] invisible audience of this state
[2:36:07] huh he's talking to us
[2:36:10] in the invisible audience of the tape
[2:36:12] he said your present state of mind after
[2:36:15] listening to this tape
[2:36:17] proves to you what class you are in
[2:36:21] amen
[2:36:22] brother especially after all those years
[2:36:24] which is about set well i guess it's
[2:36:26] almost 60 years i guess
[2:36:29] since he preached it
[2:36:30] this is he preached in 1963 this is
[2:36:34] 2022. now 23.
[2:36:37] so he's he's pre-set many years ago
[2:36:40] just think and he was
[2:36:42] he's talking to all those
[2:36:44] that were believing it all down through
[2:36:45] the ages all down through the years
[2:36:48] so i pray the grace of god that we are
[2:36:50] believers
[2:36:52] amen that we truly believe the word by
[2:36:55] the grace of god
[2:36:56] we believe the truth the whole truth
[2:36:58] nothing but the truth
[2:37:00] brother
[2:37:01] because the faith that the faith that we
[2:37:03] are looking for and the faith that god's
[2:37:05] required of us now
[2:37:07] what is what faith we do we need
[2:37:10] well we need as i've said before we need
[2:37:13] the faith that they had down through the
[2:37:14] ages
[2:37:15] but
[2:37:16] god required something of us that he
[2:37:18] didn't require of them
[2:37:20] god requires some of us that he he's not
[2:37:22] required of them and that's the rapture
[2:37:26] oh yeah so do we have the oh well i
[2:37:29] believe god and i i believe that i'm a
[2:37:33] sinner saved by grace and i i believe
[2:37:35] that that i'm healed and i'm and god
[2:37:38] does this god god's meeting my needs yes
[2:37:41] but are you believing for the rapture
[2:37:45] god gave
[2:37:46] gave them the faith you know in luther's
[2:37:48] age to believe
[2:37:49] justification and on down to
[2:37:51] sanctification he gave the pentecostals
[2:37:53] the faith the word they believed for the
[2:37:56] gift of the spirit and and and the
[2:37:58] anointing and of the baptism of the holy
[2:38:00] ghost but now god's asking us to believe
[2:38:03] that plus
[2:38:05] oh yeah well yeah god still required of
[2:38:08] us what he gave in all other ages
[2:38:10] because now it's the end now we're
[2:38:12] finished amen
[2:38:15] and god now
[2:38:16] now we're come down to the elf the omega
[2:38:19] of the plan and purpose of god amen
[2:38:22] not oh yeah i believe the alpha and i
[2:38:25] believe luther i believe wesley and i
[2:38:27] believe what god did during the
[2:38:29] pentecostal age but now do we believe
[2:38:31] what god's doing in the bright age
[2:38:34] praise the lord
[2:38:35] because
[2:38:37] in the lutheran age they went forth
[2:38:38] believing what god had revealed
[2:38:41] and in the in the methodist age they
[2:38:43] went forth believing what god revealed
[2:38:45] pentecostals went forth believing what
[2:38:47] god revealed
[2:38:48] they don't believe it now like they did
[2:38:50] then
[2:38:51] no no
[2:38:52] but we believe the bride believes that
[2:38:55] plus
[2:38:56] now we believe what god has revealed in
[2:38:58] the opening of the word and this
[2:39:00] revealing the mysteries of god and
[2:39:02] what's oh well that's wonderful we
[2:39:03] believe that but again let's understand
[2:39:06] that it's revealed to give us faith that
[2:39:10] god wants us to have now and only that
[2:39:12] the faith that we need now
[2:39:15] so praise the lord god never required
[2:39:17] this of luther or wesley or the
[2:39:19] pentecostals but he is required of us
[2:39:21] now and that is for the rapture
[2:39:24] oh
[2:39:25] the rapture yeah the dead in christ
[2:39:27] shall rise first well they've gone down
[2:39:30] and they went down with that faith
[2:39:31] they'll come that faith will bring them
[2:39:33] back
[2:39:34] amen but now there's gonna be a living
[2:39:36] saints and remember again the prophet
[2:39:39] said god is waiting on us
[2:39:42] what for the rapture
[2:39:45] yeah
[2:39:46] and now that he said the dead in christ
[2:39:47] are waiting on us for the resurrection
[2:39:50] yeah because they're going to the
[2:39:52] prophets of the dead in christ are going
[2:39:53] to appear to the living saints
[2:39:55] and we're going to stay in the dimension
[2:39:57] with them and be changed and we're going
[2:39:59] to rise to meet the lord in the air
[2:40:01] we're going to be raptured
[2:40:03] praise the lord
[2:40:05] do we believe what god's doing and i'll
[2:40:07] tell you this
[2:40:09] when god came and did what he did for
[2:40:11] luther and wesley it changed them or
[2:40:13] they lived different lives they went out
[2:40:15] and
[2:40:15] and they acted different they preached
[2:40:17] different and so on amen their attitude
[2:40:20] was different their spirit was different
[2:40:21] their faith was different amen so
[2:40:24] brother the pentecostal is the same
[2:40:26] thing
[2:40:27] but brother
[2:40:28] god's required more of us than he than
[2:40:30] he did of the pentecostals
[2:40:32] more of us than he did of luther and
[2:40:33] wesley he required that plus that
[2:40:37] what
[2:40:38] yeah i believe i got that he justified
[2:40:40] me he sanctified me he has filled me
[2:40:42] with the holy ghost he has given me
[2:40:44] access to the gifts if if i need them
[2:40:47] and and so on but now
[2:40:49] he's he's given me the the revelation of
[2:40:51] the mystery of god genesis to revelation
[2:40:54] to show me that now
[2:40:56] i come to the the omega
[2:40:58] of god's plan and purpose
[2:41:01] now we come to the time of the
[2:41:03] resurrection and the rapture
[2:41:05] amen that's why the dead in christ are
[2:41:07] waiting on us
[2:41:09] because what god has done is to give us
[2:41:11] resurrection and rapturing faith
[2:41:14] amen so the dead in christ the prophet
[2:41:16] said it's going to come forth and appear
[2:41:18] to the living saints
[2:41:20] but
[2:41:21] you've got to have that faith
[2:41:23] for them to do that
[2:41:25] amen
[2:41:26] and then we're going to be caught up to
[2:41:28] meet the lord in the air raptured
[2:41:30] hallelujah
[2:41:32] raptured praise the lord
[2:41:34] amen and we're going to spend that time
[2:41:36] with the lord and with the saints that
[2:41:38] are going on then we're going to come
[2:41:40] back and reign upon the earth by the
[2:41:42] grace of god oh yes

[2:44:00] are becoming more conscious of the
[2:44:02] rapture oh brother i'll tell you this
[2:44:06] i tell you
[2:44:07] when when martin luther got that
[2:44:09] after all he did
[2:44:11] he practically almost he went around
[2:44:13] everywhere
[2:44:14] he felt that he had to do this do this
[2:44:16] to be justified
[2:44:18] oh yeah i got to do these works to be
[2:44:20] justified i got to do this image i got
[2:44:21] to make these sacrifices to be justified
[2:44:24] uh-huh until finally god revealed it in
[2:44:26] the word
[2:44:28] that your just shall live by faith why
[2:44:31] because jesus has justified him
[2:44:34] jesus sanctified him
[2:44:36] amen oh
[2:44:38] when that struck luther that's amazing
[2:44:41] and then john wesley he was in a cottage
[2:44:44] meeting
[2:44:45] of
[2:44:47] lutheran believers people that believed
[2:44:49] in luther and luther's message and so
[2:44:51] john wesley was in that college meeting
[2:44:53] and he was listening to the preacher
[2:44:55] preach and he was talking about
[2:44:56] justification the adjuster lived by
[2:44:58] faith and jesus justified us jesus did
[2:45:01] this jesus did that
[2:45:03] oh it struck john wesley and he said it
[2:45:05] struck him and he said the anointing
[2:45:07] went from the crown of his head he said
[2:45:09] down to the souls of his feet
[2:45:12] and he said he got the revelation that
[2:45:14] he was sanctified
[2:45:16] amen
[2:45:17] he didn't have to go do this he didn't
[2:45:19] have to do that jesus already did it
[2:45:22] jesus justified them jesus sanctified us
[2:45:25] amen and alleluia jesus is the eternal
[2:45:28] life the whole baptism of the holy ghost
