tonight amen we're going to sing only believe as we go to the word because the lord willing i want to start on a series on the redemption amen it's been on my heart for quite a while and but tonight we're going to hear the prophet preach on redemption and it's only i think about maybe an hour or less than an hour and then i will i'll try not to be an hour after or or before amen but we'll get into this series on redemption the problem of god preached on it a number of times including redemption by power and that's the message we'll hear tonight amen and another one in fact this was in the in in the sunday on a sunday evening and just a week later i believe it was he preached again redemption in completeness and in joy amen so i just want to share with you the revelation to get into it in a more personal way concerning redemption what is redemption amen so we pray the grace of god that we know what it is and we got the experience of it by the grace of god in our hearts in our souls amen in our entire beings we've been redeemed we know where we come from we know where we're going amen because why because of redemption i've ministered on eternity and time coming from eternity into time going back from time to time after eternity amen and brother takes redemption to get us back amen by the grace of almighty god we have to be redeemed amen we need to experience redemption amen that we come into this world with a worldly nature worldly worldly attitudes worldly motives worldly objectives amen but praise the lord there was a seed on the inside amen that god quickened that seed oh praise the lord and brother it just fought everything else amen it just keeps it bring it brings us in line with the word of god the will of god amen the promise of god so oh what you're trying to change brother sister listen the rest of the world they're even religious people they're just living living living in the world living for the world living for this living oh when i die hopefully i'll go to heaven and so i know brother sister god want to deal with your air if god's not dealing with you here you won't be there amen because why heaven is here amen is just in another dimension and god by the holy ghost brings us in contact with heaven amen with the nature of heaven by the grace of almighty god so i pray the grace of god that we truly truly have an experience of redemption and then we'll understand what the prophet is going to minister on in redemption by power amen and again it's a short message maybe less than an hour that we will hear and a week later he preached on redemption again amen in completeness and in joy amen brother to enter into well to enter into the complete revelation of redemption you're going to experience the joy of god amen you experience the joy of heaven by the grace of almighty god god help us brother that again we're not controlled by the world we're not living for the world we're controlled by god we're controlled by jesus living for god living for jesus living for the promise amen so brother is not just a religion as i've said so many take this bible and it's religion oh yeah we believe we believe they got a creed and as i said the message to a lot of believers is a creed oh yeah we believe i believe this i believe this brother you don't just believe it you become it amen you become the word of flesh for your day for your hour by the grace of almighty god amen so i pray the grace of god to help us truly and to have that experience of redemption in our souls amen in our spirits and believing for the redemption of our bodies amen brother this is what keeps us moving on this is why we're here we as the prophet of god highlighted again and he might make reference to it in this message or the other one that he read he spoke on redemption amen brother why we're here amen because we are brothers and sisters amen oh yeah you got a closer relationship with one another spiritually than you have with your natural family oh yes most definitely again as i i visited certain uh we always visited brother and sister burns for years and years and years while they were in gamble and i traveled back and forth there or and even after i got married we go back and forth back and forth and we just you know just drop into our natural parents hello yeah and so on but we move on to brother and sister barnes oh yes as i said one time we took a cat with us not the cat we got now but it was a cat and then and uh the cat was old and but be honest all due respect but the not even the cat was relaxed in my natural parents home oh no and oh my and uh my parents felt what in the wrong what's wrong with that cat it won't relax and so on you know and but i knew what it was but so we moved on to our brother and sister burns us with the cat amen what did the cat do went on into the living room got on the chesterville went to sleep why i said oh she feels relaxed here i said amen oh yes to the different spirit and different attitude why because even in that home there's believers all that went through they all loved to visit brothers and sister parents and only that there were denominational people amen in that town and they would go in to just to sit with him amen because of the of the nature of uh yoyo of the atmosphere because they knew it was different and not only not only adults but even children even young boys and girls would sometimes go and just knock on brother sister burns the door and they come in and sit down why because of the atmosphere amen so brother sister amen that's the atmosphere of the holy ghost amen i trust by grace that we got the anointing on our lives to create that atmosphere in our homes amen praise the name of the lord to god be the glory why because we are creatures of time where we brother sister were born near physically but brother there's a seed on the inside to keep us mindful of where we come from why we're here where we're going and how we're going to get there amen how are we going to get there are we going to make it back redemption amen redeemed returned amen by the grace of almighty god hallelujah brother i trust we've got a true revelation of redemption amen oh it's not just i was lost but oh yeah jesus redeemed me and i'm saved no brother's getting back home what for we want to get back to our father that's what the bible says whereby we can now cry oh father father father amen we got we got the experience with him now we're going to see him and experience him hallelujah probably god said he said i want to introduce you is all to jesus but he said after i've introduced you to jesus he said i want to get on my knees and crawl up to his feet amen humble himself he said i trust by grace here let me do it amen it was so real to brother branham amen brother let's move on let's introduce them to jesus amen let our lives reflect the real jesus christ amen that he's not history he's just not he's not religion amen no no he's god and he's with us and he's in us amen and he's working in me working to you amen what's he working he's working redemption amen he's revealing himself i like it let me say it again brother sister it's important as to why god allowed all this to happen why did god allow that to happen in the garden of eden oh because many times people think oh that that just happened the devil the devil did it no god was disappointed oh now i got to do this now i got to do that no god knew it was going to happen amen god permitted it but he knew it why because he wanted to show his love to you and get your love for him back amen so you're going to love him for himself power of god says that's why god has done what he's done he allowed all this amen what to show his love amen genuine love what for he said to bring forth a real right love for him for from his sons and daughters because it's too many oh jesus here i love the lord thank you lord and no no you've got to love him for who he is and he would love him for what he did amen thank you lord but praise the lord now we can cry have a father amen now i know you oh lord amen we've been restored back together again oh i praise the lord evan's going to be wonderful amen praise the name of the lord as i've said lord almighty this uh lord i pray don't let me get used to this at all what's going on in this world what's going on you know in here what what family sometimes some friends and neighbors are doing no no no no no we're not gonna not gonna compromise with it lord i'm hungry more and more and more for for glory i'm hungry more and more lord jesus to get home i want to get on oh yeah not naturally i want to get off spiritually praise the lord hallelujah so i pray god we appreciate what he's done amen and we're going to show to him our appreciation what we do how we do it amen our love for him amen and if we love him you're going to give him preeminence oh yes most definitely hallelujah in all things you're going to acknowledge him in all things you're going to consult the lord so grace to us brother sister as we go into the series on redemption and to understand redemption him us where we're going amen again as i drew it on the prophet actually drew the same thing of that big circle of eternity eternity we dropped down into into into a body called time but there was a before he did that how he had a plan of redemption oh he did this just to oh just he allowed it he knows i'll tell you his seed is going to do it he's going to believe his seed is going to be faithful amen but understand this the problem of god said he said you're going to be surprised he said who made it what surprised oh yeah who made it i'm surprised you didn't make it well we thought this one was going to make it that one would make it amen sometimes brothers like like the the angel rebuked the prophet of god because he was criticizing that woman walking down the street and so on oh yeah and he says don't do that brother branham some of them are my children amen so brother you're gonna be surprised what surprise i when i get there i thought i would just see all i'm seeing now you're gonna see somebody different amen by the grace of god lord who's that that one made it oh yeah by the grace of god it's like oh brother i pray god give us the revelation amen brother the prophet of god said that time in the resurrection rapture the dead in christ going to appear to the living saints on the earth oh are you going to recognize them are you really going to recognize who they are i pray grace we're going to walk in the spirit and they're going to come forth in the spirit amen and he said then the living saints will move with them into that other dimension and into glorified bodies oh brother god help us god elders to be spiritually minded not religiously minded amen but spiritually and brother it's a spiritual mind that that keeps us separated from the world the things of the world oh it is not religious mind but spiritual amen and my brother it's not in the sometimes because you're spiritual it's not that you're you i'm i'm i'm not going to have nothing to do with there's nothing to do with it no no it's just if you're spiritual they don't want nothing to do with you oh yeah because again the prophet warned us when it comes to being spiritual is you get together with spiritual and he said you avoid religious people he said why he said their spirit can get on you but he said that your spirit won't get on them so brother be careful amen make sure we got the anointing the power of god the love of god so brother we're not gonna we're not gonna let the devil trick us no not by any means no way we're gonna go farth as seed of god the sons and daughters of god amen live as sons and daughters of god talk as sons and daughters of god act the sons and daughters of god amen amen have that desire as the sons and daughters of god and what what is that desire to go home we want to go home lord amen well there's something wrong if you feel comfortable in this world and you love this you like this you like that you not love it you like it amen god alphys because brother god's going to let it get get get worse and worse and worse and worse amen so that what so that there is seed is going to get more and more separated oh yeah more and more separated by the grace of almighty god amen so the lord help us as we go to the word tonight concerning redemption let's make sure we're redeemed we got the experience of redemption we live the way we live because of redemption amen god did this in redemption amen he turned us around and we're going back in a different direction the door is open it's still open waiting for us to get back praise the name of the lord do god be the glory so the lord bless us we'll read a scripture and then we'll sing only believe to hear the prophet and as i said the message is uh redemption by power and it'll be less than maybe an hour in ephesians chapter 1 ephesians chapter 1 and we want to read a few verses there beginning at verse 9 and he made known unto us the mystery of his will his will for your life his will for us in this in this hour in this age brother i pray grace that we'll get less and less and less caught up with the world the things of the world amen and brother that were being challenged more and more in this hour in this age than they were in previous ages oh yeah that's that's why that's why this previous age goes into a total darkness amen and the prophet said he put that there but brother when the angel drew it on the wall in brown tabernacle it was all black man and he said just put that there i think brother john might have referenced it to the jonathan and what reference said what fourth to represent the bride just that little bit of light i'll tell you he put this much there but you know if we if we had to really do it spiritually it would be very just like a dot just like maybe just a little white dot to represent the bride of christ god help us to be the bride god elvis hallelujah to have that bright nature and that bright character amen ephesians chapter 1 and beginning to read at verse 9 and he made known unto us the mystery of his will amen according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen and it says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance hallelujah praise the lord in christ and it says being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work of all things after the council of his own will and again i was challenged by a pentecostal pastor he's a different church now a different denomination but back then he came and pastor he said i i can't see nor understand what some pete preached regarding predestination they leave the impression he said that god predestinates this one to go to heaven that want to go to hell he said surely he said god's not going to do that that's not his will for this not nobody said brother us you've got to understand predestination is based on foreknowledge what for knowledge i said god foreknew that person god knew what they would do god knew the attitude they would have god knew whether they would accept or reject jesus oh he said oh that explains it thank you oh my praise the lord he says wonderful now i believe amen sir brother let's be spiritual praise the lord according to the will of god amen amen again verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance in christ praise the lord being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work of all things after the counsel of his own will amen grace that we're in and under and controlled by the predestinated will of god not my will thine be done and it says that ye that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ praise the lord and it's all to the praise of his glory amen love him with all your heart hallelujah hallelujah in whom also ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise i trust you're sealed amen amen you're sealed in not sealed out grace and he said which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and brother it is the earnest or the down payment of our inheritance oh yeah that's what it's referring to the down payment what for the promise of more to come hallelujah the earnest of our inheritance until the full redemption praise the lord of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory oh brother give god the glory hallelujah that we're still pressing on thank you jesus we'll give the glory to god if not we'd be out there in the world oh yeah oh they're in a dead denominational church god help us walk in the lightest as he is in the light amen he is the light amen then he makes us the light we become the light by the grace of god amen he said again verse 15 wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love oh love unto all the saints it's like that roman catholic bishop one time after the prophet's going and they interviewed him about william branham what he felt about william branham he said listen he said if there's anyone that had divine love it was william brown and he said if you anyone if there was anyone that you knew that loved you he said william brown he said just talk with him and you knew he loved you amen he didn't look down his nose at you he looked at his nose at them or then i know there's a lot of believers as i've said i preached against it when i first come to this message why because they of the attitude and the spirit i was seen among believers they're looking down their noses and everybody else except those in the message and they looked on their nose there's some of them amen but don't do that that's the grace of god to you grace of god to them amen so brother keep your attitude right keep your spirit right amen lord i am what i am by the grace of god thank you jesus amen and jesus brings us into that fellowship amen with the will of god and again in verse 15 wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers oh brother sister i pray we got the same anointing the same feeling amen that we're praying one for another oh god help brother so-and-so lord help our sister so-and-so lord they need you we lord without you we can do nothing amen brother lord i can't do it my brother and sister didn't do it lord they need you so i'm praying for them plead the token for them god help them amen and cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation amen brother you need some wisdom with your revelation father jonathan i think touched on that the other night amen surely we do wisdom get wisdom and with your getting get understanding praise the lord anything we need is wisdom oh yes amen the wisdom of god and it says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness oh of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power brother he's revealing himself in you his power is anointing his love his mercy is grace brother he's revealing it in his bride by the grace of god brother help us to go forth as the sons and daughters of god not of a church organization or denomination but the sons and daughters of god brother it's not well we came from the this this town or that town these parents that parents no no now thank you oh all that's in the past oh yeah lord we came from glory we're on our way back we're on our way home lord amen so i trust we and brother god gave the word and what god does in every age it is keep us mindful of where we come from that's right and to give us the word that will create in us a hunger and thirst more and more for where we come from we've got to want to go amen amen i trust we feel oh yeah feel uncomfortable in this world jesus did he did yeah he was very uncomfortable he didn't want to stay here any longer and why shall i be long how much longer shall i be with you he said do we feel that way lord your will be done but lord we want to go home and any and he wants he wants that to see that hunger and thirst in you he wants to hear it oh yeah because you gotta brother if you're gonna be there you gotta want to be there not just oh just wait on the lord we don't know god he's waiting on you why because he has given you the word to give you the faith to get home grace amen so the lord bless us amen so we're going to go into this message on redemption by power amen and the lord willing we'll move on to that other sermons the things that i want to share with you concerning redemption let's appreciate it brother sister what god has done and what god is doing he has redeemed us he is redeeming us and he will redeem us amen brother he's he didn't just do this that's it he keeps he keeps bringing it to pass in your life amen he redeemed us and he came back and he called his elect in every age amen remember when he came forth in an absolute complete victory of redemption and he ascended the old christmas ain't just sitting with him amen amen when they when they got up there they got it right there they oh the gate was closed and they stand they were screaming open up the gates open the gates they said oh who wants to go in he said it's the king of glory amen let him in amen praise the lord and he opened the gates so he could go in and as the power of god said he took that body that he that he redeemed us in amen and he went and and he stood at me by the throne amen as a symbol as a remembrance ever amen that it's done amen praises three amen and the life of the blood came back to you and me on the day of pentecost hallelujah and brother praise the lord at the time of the resurrection rapture amen praise the lord brother jesus comes down in the paranoia of the holy spirit the holy ghost is christ amen and he's pulling us into that dimension and the power of god said we

i believe lord [Music] things are possible lord i believe lord i may [Music] lord [Music] amen god bless you may be seated and be in prayer in the going forth of the word amen to catch the revelation amen um redemption amen now we know that we can pull back the leads of this book and turn these pages over but there's only one who can open the book that's jesus christ john saw the book it was sealed and he wept because there was no man in heaven could open it no man on earth no man beneath the earth but there was a lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world come tuck the book out of the right hand of him and set up on the throne and open the seals and open the book loses loosely sealed thereof and he was worthy or he had been slain from the foundation of the world let's speak to him tonight ask him to open it for us just now now kind loving father we come to thee addressing thee first in the name of jesus praying now that is we stand here sheltered under this roof tonight for that storm is raging outside rains are twisting and blowing we're so thankful to have the house of god to come in and we're thankful that there is a tower a refuge it said the name of the lord is the mighty tower the righteous run into it in her face we're so glad that we know the name of the lord and has come into it now we pray that you'll open this word to us tonight father may the holy spirit come and get into the word circumcise the lips of this poor humble servant and the hearts of those who will listen your children and may the holy spirit take just the words of god and place it in every heart just where it's needed bless us now renew our minds tonight and thy spirit get glory out of service save the lost heal is sick bring home the backslidden lord and we'll give you the praise for we asked it in the name of thy beloved son [Music] jesus now turn to the 10th verse of the 12th chapter of exodus we were reading the redemption by blood how that god had ordained the lamb to be slain in each house how there would be nothing left over the judgment has been fallen and the last judgment now was ready to fall god was going to fulfill his word to the letter and all those judgments back there was a perfect sign or a perfect uh type of the judgments which are ready to fall down and if you'll notice before the judgments fell now ministers may disagree with me on this which is all right but before the judgment started hitting egypt god sent israel to goshen they were in goshen and no flag fellow man a perfect type of the church carried over through the tribulation seat all right then at the last flag that struck the earth there struck egypt was death all you bible readers shared know your sunday school lessons and so forth has taken his perhaps many times but death was the last enemy that struck egypt and the last enemy that's going to strike the church now is death spiritually speaking those who will not follow christ and and baptism of the holy spirit will spiritually dry up and die the church as you see it now after many many great revivals and evangelists has passed through the land and yet the church is that is politically church speaking is getting worse all the time its members are just living any way they want to doing anything they want to yet calling themselves christians they say they're all right to be a christian means to be christ-like go to a place you wouldn't want to be if christ would come say nothing you would more be saying when christ comes doing nothing that you won't be doing when christ comes think nothing you won't be thinking when christ comes keep your one motive your heart centered on calvary amen walk in the light as he is in the light and we have fellowship one with another the blood of jesus christ god's son cleanses us from all unrighteousness that's methodist baptist and all of us together makes us all one in him now the last the last thing was death and before that death comes there was an atonement made for that death or all who desire to escape it and there was an atonement made before the first destruction of the andalusian world god had a creature of righteousness noah and he preached 120 years for people to come into the ark and those who willfully refused to go there was nothing left for judgment and today man who refused to walk in the light of christ you have spurned mercy so there's nothing left but judgment that's all there's a right left side the only one you can go to and you make your choice now we see before the the great awful night come that israel was commanded we already taken that of killing the lamb god would bring his church into the exodus to bring it out of egypt into the promised land i like that they were going over to possess the land god gave them the land and yet it was all fenced in with big great buildings and fences and walls around jericho the church could run races around it and just think of that yet god said i'll give it to you it's yours but they had to clean up clean it up and that's what god has did today he's give every one of you it wants it the baptism of the holy ghost but you got to go and possess it that's all find out the differences and tear down the walls and get started in there and get it you see the pastor said it's not for us today just walk i don't pass it mother said i'll run you away from home go right on the passage husband said i'll leave you go out on a passage that's all got to go and possess it that's all divine meaning for every one of you every one of you sitting here tonight with cancer heart trouble whatever it is god has give the promise and it's yours but you have to go and possess it now you say well i just don't feel it's very good that has nothing to do with it the promise is yours god give it to you just go out and play bliss scenes from one side of the other and take out all that have i an amber light just kill them out go on and take it god said it's yours go get it but he didn't say now i'll go and sweep it all out build you up tonight cities and set you down on easy street he doesn't do that way he gives it to you and you got something to do he's good enough to give you the land said he'll help you and be with you go take it and if you're sick tonight crippled blind death dumb whatever you are go take it god said it was yours it's your succession god gave it to you he told him that he was given that land sent an angel before him to take care of the way bring him into the place where it was look at them spies when they went over here comes ten of them back to oh we can't do it it's impossible while we're scientists and we've looked the thing over it's scientifically impossible we can't do it but there was two fellows one named joshua and one named caleb they were looking at what the scientific side was they were looking to what god said that we can do it that's right and they brought back some evidence that it was a good land i'm so glad of that evidence aren't you that is a good land mr brothers and we're on the road tonight hallelujah all right here it was now just before redemption god required the children of israel that they'd be sure to be protected to kill this lamb and to put the blood on the little the top of the door like this and each post and they were to go in and eat this lamb every bit of it notice all the lamb not just part of it every bit of it to be eaten some people say i'll just take this part now i believe this part but you've got to take it all every bit of so i believe he was wounded for our transgressions but by stripes i don't know about it we want it all every bit of it is to be all of us of it gets tough but we have to eat it anyhow god said so notice the 10th verse now and ye shall uh ye shall let nothing of it remain until morning and that which remains until [Music] and now none of it is to remain everything now he said when you eat it don't eat it raw or sodden but you must eat it uh well cooked now i like that people trying to eat the word of god and they take it like it was raw chew on it and spit on it and everything i thought i just can't take it i can't stand it it isn't cooked done enough that's all he said cook it with fire fire represents the holy ghost you get god in your heart first he'll cook it for you cook it out done season then it tastes good now you can't stand oats like this outside say oh just get the holy ghost first and watch what divine healing means to you then look what heartfelt religion means to you then when you've got the holy spirit to cook the lamb as it comes amen that's right cook the land first and you have to have power to cook it with it should be roasted oh my that's when it's good roasted it just burns out all the ascending here not long ago by a big smelter and i noticed how hot that fire was and it just cooked and cooked and cooked and as hotter it got the the drops in the metals in the gold all come to the top and it skimmed it off and it heats the fall a little harder and just smelled it and then when it's a ball more it gets some more different stuff and stuff out of it the first come up was the dirt like dirt mug the next come up with oars like oh something no good some quick silvers and all these things they come up to skim at all went on down right down in the last thing they took out of it was pyrite you know there's a lot of things in people that try to fool one another when you're a christian or acting like it anyhow but you just let the holy ghost sort of fall and earn i think takes all the food out of you fools gold many people go out west and they find some of it and they think oh they struck a gold mine it shines better than gold up but it's full of gold has got no value to it and now they cook that and just skim it all off and just keep cooking it and cooking it until it's pure gold balls down to nothing but 100 percent gold that's the way god does in his church holds the holy spirit on him crooks [Music] [Music] amen now then you can eat it here's another beautiful thought here on this on the 11th verse and thus shall you eat it with your listen to this line i like that shoes on your feet staff in your hands usually didn't hate it's a large passover i like that while you're eating be ready to go that's the issue let's turn over to ephesians about the sixth chapter of ephesians and looking here what paul said about get the church ready sixth chapter ephesians beginning at the 14th verse of the sixth chapter stand therefore having your laws girded about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all things take the shield of faith forward you shall be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god [Music] see paul dressing up a man for the battlefield for the heart god and beginning of delivering of israel he said now you want to get ready for the march when you come under the blood put on your shoes gird up your lawn get your staff in your hands and get ready for the call i like that a man now when he comes into christ he gets his gospel shoes on the streets the gospel the helmet of salvation on the breastplate of righteousness girthed up his lawn they just usually in the old soldiers when they put on those ornaments of war they had a big belt that buckled it together holding over their lawns these shields to keep the enemy spears off what a real blessing that is to us and when the the lawrence began to get weak hang down the shield that tighten up on the belt bring him up tight again what a perfect picture today when you begin to feel like you're slacking or the devil says there's no use reach down and tighten up the belly a little bit pull up the shoulders a little tight in the hand and go forward i like that be ready for the march every man walking under that blood that night was commanded to stay there not go out until the orders come to march and every man that's born of the spirit of god comes into christ has everlasting eyes puts on his shield his breastplate standing ready and forbidden to leave until orders to march oh isn't it marvelous aren't you glad you got it all harnessed up tonight you soldiers used to have a strong leader at the tabernacle our theme song was the fight his own old christian soldiers face to face and sternery with ours dreaming color streaming the right wrongs engaged today the fight is all but be not weary be strong enemies if god be for us his barriers will sing the victory song at last manimal's tanks has gone to the grave but one of these days younger in a new world when they come forth into the promised land the banner of the cross will be over us and we'll sing the victor song when we said it's a wedding supper that night around the table that great table maybe a hundred thousand miles long with the blood more spanx sitting around i want to go down along the table and shake hands with every one of them amen just shouting you want to hear me shout wait still get over there watch me i ain't big enough yet for this but notice on the march now get ready we're going here's a sad picture before we get over to a regular lesson it's found in the 38th verse there listen and a mixed multitude went up with their flop that's where israel made a mistake the supernatural had been done and unconverted people followed because of the supernatural finally got him into trouble and on down when lord shared about the 42nd verse and the 43rd verse the lord speaking to moses said that no one but those who were sacrificed could eat the sacrifice brother but those who were circumcised no strangers no outsiders no one should take it but those who are circumcised and what is this grace that we have today this day beloved friends that when in the church everybody that belongs to the church takes communion and that's wrong only those who are redeemed that's all who are worthy isaiah's spoken said the tables of the lord will be full of vomit says who shall teach doctrine that will wean from the breath said free must be up on precip line up online here and everyone hold fast to that what's good god speaking knowing that the days that we're living in that the church would be so politically until they let everything people come in long as they had their name on the church book they were memorably taken communion and the bible said he that eats and drinks that unworthy is guilty of the body and the blood of the lord saint john 13th chapter jesus speaking second corinthians 11 chapter paul said years later that he that eats and drinks this unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord let a man examine himself he says before take i'm quoting scripture that's right he that eats and drinks unworthy and drinks damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body and for this cause many are sick and weakly among you and many sleep be sure that you're standing right with god here it is in the shadow that no one but the circumcised no matter how long he was how much he helped the jewish church he had to be a proselyte had to be a real circumcised believer before he could take the communion or eat the passover oh how far we got off the line today now let's go quickly then and god brought them out turning now to the 13th of the 14th chapter god gave them the pillar of fire to go before them i think they had a picture here tonight and i say it was reverend to my honest opinion while we're here in this group tonight i believe that is with us tonight this same pillar of power the other children of israel is going to force performing the same times and wonders and any teacher here a scholar of the bible knows that the angel that followed israel and guided them to the promised land was the angel of the covenant which was jesus christ and today jesus christ the same yesterday and forever is falling before this group that you won't call us holy rulers if you want to all right going on leading from victory unto victory praise god in their nations in their days they were despised and hated and rejected and turned down by the nations and call everything so is this a day with a true believer you and your churches you know when you take a stand for christ and speak for truth the whole church says look at him he's lost his mind he's gone crazy don't pay no attention to that follow along you're all all right now the blood's going before you the holy spirit leading it just keep moving don't pay attention to what nobody tells you look take the calvary and march on beautiful type now they had come out to the god and now notice blood redemption brought them out of egypt now they had to have something else now to take them all over into the right now they're just beginning to start they've come out been circumcised come under the blood and on the march now they got up for something there is going along there knowing if it passed from death unto life know they had eternal life but there they are coming up now and difficult begins to rise here comes pharaoh's army pursuing them to take them trolls set in listen god is our refuge and our strength a very present help in time of trouble oh i hope you see this here it is first now and moses said unto the people fear not i love that after jesus rules the dead his words were taught they care not that's what the trouble of the church today is scared to death you're going to make a failure how can you fail when you're in christ you can't fail you've got everlasting life all demons in hell i can't shake you you got everlasting life jesus said so so don't be scared of failure you say well i'm afraid i'll get fanatic i'll go to have a little fanaticism in a set still and do nothing i sure would a man who's going to do something is told about ballard's up here a fella come to get a job from him and he said sign your name here tuck his pencil to sign he said where's your eraser don't go make no mistakes he said i can't use you anyone to do nothing that's right if you don't make no mistakes you're you're not doing nothing let's go brother be up and down all right long fellow there tell me not in mindful numbers life is but a density dream and the soul is dead to slumber and things are not what they've seen but yes life is real and life is earnest and the grave is not at school thus our to just return it's not spoken of the soul let us be up and doing with our heart for any side be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero don't wait for people to persuade you to christ stand like our man or lady accept him and walk forward in victory amen that's what god wants rugged ready soldier you might not be way 105 pounds but you can still be ready brother and full of power if you'll just let god have his way i've seen man that weighed 200 pound didn't have an ounce of man in him that's right all right notice moses said unto the people fear not stand still and see the salvation of the lord that's good just march on don't get scared about nothing if you accepted christ as your savior guam brother right now off the back of the holy ghost just keep moving don't fear you say i'm sick now go down i can't go much farther don't worry just keep moving on see the salvation of our lord accept it just move on how is it going to be the doctor turned it out the fella had done the best he could but god hasn't done his best yet let's try that's the moment listen now all right of law which he will show unto you today are the egyptians the assailants the truth the troublemakers say brother grant if i could just quit smoking if i could just lay down drinking if i could just quit my stealing if i could just put my uh doing this that the other don't worry just walk on god will take care of the rest of it if i know what i can do it brother graham i'd accept christ right now don't you worry move on this long you'll see the salvation of the lord for the egyptians who you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever amen it's going to be settled after a while the lord shall fight for you and you shall be hold your peace and the lord said unto moses what will cry sound to me speak to the children of israel that they go forward i like it don't try to say say well i joined the church ten years ago brother branham i've been a good faithful member that's fine i appreciate that but let's move on guys god's moving on the people today here they go back they say well now science 150 years ago there was a science in france that said if a man ever went to terrific speed of 30 miles an hour gravitation take him off here as he'd be gone 30 miles an hour he's going about 1600 miles an hour now you never use science refer back to that fella he was all right yesterday but they're living in another day that's right but we preachers oh no divine healing now let me see what what saint moody finney not calvin some of them said about it they were all on their days but we're moving on going forward we got something else jesus said in the parable of all the sores where the sword went forth and sowed seeds and some the enemy come around sold some weeds in the wheat he said let them grow together you're always important how wicked the worlds are getting but you fail to see how powerful the churches are getting you at the same time she's rising up standing on a field she's a little [Music] amen god's church shall never fail the gates of hell shall not prevail against it shall they be against it but they cannot prevail the church is going to triumph through the blood of jesus christ to the victory march i'm positive of this one thing that god will have a church without wrinkle or blemishes amen i'm so happy about that now if i am in that church amen brother how do you get into it no how do you get into it by birth into it i've been in the branham family 45 years the sixth day of this coming april they never did ask me to join their family i was born the brand i always be abraham i told the christian in jesus christ i'll be a christian because god has ordained it so far elections he called us to the grace of his own beloved son we accepted him and got eternal life by one handshake by one membership by one letter by one spirit we're all baptized into one body jesus christ there become fellow citizens of the kingdom i was thinking today as i was always praying at how that this is the day that we're going to have to answer for i'm not going to have to answer for the generation that was before me or the generation that will be after me but in the judgment i understand with this generation now i said look at a woman's picture on the sign deer drinking something other said she was breathless or something i said yes in life let's do all right there you are i said what a disgrace of all the preaching i said sometimes it seems it told my wife i said sometimes it seems it doesn't do any good but i've got to be the voice of warning anyhow regardless of what people does about it i've got to preach the gospel anyhow and give a witness unto the resurrection and the power of jesus let them christ it and turn their back god will judge them at the judgment part i'm only responsible for preaching and other minister students preaching the gospel now i just love it notice go forever now and you will see the glory of god listen the 16th verse now we read this [Music] but lift up the rod the rod that was the judgment rod now it wasn't moses rod that was god's wrong if you'll notice moses he took that rod he held it up like this please come here all the water to turn the blood it was god's judgment line and that same rock get that same rod as what he smoked the rock with and a twist come in the side of the rock and waters came out of the rock now that rock was christ and it was god's judgment the daily the day you got smoked christ the cowardice ate that bitter agonizing death no man never could describe what it was or never will there god placed all the divine judgments up on him and shmori to the side and out of his heart from water and blood and spirit for our redemption how people paint his picture sometimes with a robe around him or something other on the cross that is my soul they disposed that man of every vowel vulgar thing that they could but he had to be that he was the highest of all the world that ever was or will be and then exposed naked on the cross wounded smitten bleeding scottish monstery spits hanging from his face and mocking crap thorns on his head but there is once he conquered death held in sickness and the grave and paid the price for all it's often said sometimes therefore he took the sting out of death that's what paul said oh death where is your sting i've been told that many insects bees and things they got a stinger and they're poisoned with it but one time they sing they [Music] speak of it there he pulled a singer out of death for you [Music] all this thing of death paul said when he's going to cut his head off in the roman prison he said death what is your sin pointed back to calvary there's where singer was taken out of death grave was your victory he said but thanks be to god it gives us the victory to our lord jesus christ amen all right the rod the judgment and stretch it out cover this the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go over on drive round through the midst of the sea and i behold i will harden the heart of the egyptians and they shall follow thee and i will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all his hopes and upon the cherished and upon the horsemen and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord and i have gotten me honor upon pharaoh and if only carrick an opponent's horses and the angel of god listen tighten up the harness now and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel he's still here the angel of god that went before the camp of israel removed and went back behind them and the pillar of the crowd went from before their faith and stood these friend and are swept up from here and stood back here a go-between in a time of trouble when trouble begins to face you sickness on the other hand trouble the angel of god comes up goes out between you and the sickness and stands our way are challenging you to take god's word god would give israel the promise that they was going to the land there was a million probably a man coming to pursue him and run them down and chop them down like a bunch of animals but the angel lord who was there to carry them to the promised land rolls up from the camp and wants to between them in danger hallelujah he still does it he'll make the way are just loving for that don't you he'll make the way for every sick person sitting here right now he's already made the way and he's standing between you in trouble and i know he's here right now you call me a fanatic if you want to i'm not responsible for what you say but i'm responsible for what i'm saying before god but he who led the children of israel if i have judged it right on that light that you see tonight are seen on that picture i suppose they put them out tonight that same angel of god is in this building right now to do just exactly what jesus did in that day he's sure to confirm just what he did than he is now and will always be the same the angel of god moving up the stand between us and sickness stand between us and death no wonder david said know i walk through the valleys of the shadow of death i'll hear no evil for thou art with me sure standing there the angel of god went before the cape of israel and removed and went and stood between them and the enemy and the angel of god is standing tonight between every individual here and the enemy [Music] i know i'm speaking out i know i'm standing here now on the platform before this little group of people tonight i know that god has constantly coming down from glory and standing in this building now if you only dare to move out on god's word see if he don't move before you watch and it came between the camp and the egyptians he's coming between you and your sickness he's standing between you and your sins right now why we are in the exodus of the church egypt was always called the world and when israel come out remember they were church members down there but after the blood and the atonement was made they become the circumcised of god and the circumcision today is the baptism of the holy spirit all said stephen all you uncircumcised in the heart near why do you always resist the holy ghost as your father said so to you the holy spirit circumcised in the heart cutting away the things of the world it used to be the old-fashioned whole in his church living i should like it live like it but today is just like the rest of the world it's a disgrace we let on the bar old brother spurgeon used to say an old methodist preacher friend of mine he used to sing a song we let down the bar we let out of ours we compromised with sin we let out of ours the sheep got out how did the ghosts get in because you lit on the bar that situated on the standard of christian living because the seminary passed out a few preachers and stand out compromised with the truth but the holy ghost has always been there to condemn sin it is tonight and he between the believer and the things of the world amen and it came between the camp and the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud of darkness to them but it gave life by night to thee so that the one came not near the other all night look the same thing that was given this group of believers life was blind and now all right put on your shockproof jacket should it come man that rejects life goes blind and walks in darkness because you don't accept life amen god's tense ministers have preached the gospel he sends times and wonders among men to have vindicated to be the truth and man reject it there's nothing left but darkness for you walk in the light while the light is shining my brother receive the light christ here's the light he's come to bring life to you but those who rejected light receive darkness and every man and woman tonight who rejects light walks in darkness not knowing where he's going he's staggering all pretty good popular with the people but wondering how he stands in the presence of god notice it brought a marvelous finger he was light to one and darkness to the other the israelites then after moses prayed they could lay down in peace now watch and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made to see a dry island and the waters were divided and the children of israel went unto the midst of the sea upon the dry ground if you notice wow the children of israel who had come out of darkness and accepted the light when they got in trouble the light turned back around and they slept all night and while they were sleeping god was sending a wind going down across the sea opening up a way of escape hallelujah to the lamb i'm so glad that i've been filled with the holy spirit tonight wow we are sleeping rejoicing resting in the promise of god god promised them to make a way of escape and while they were resting on this promise god was down there before him opening up a wave every man and woman tonight that will accept jesus christ on those grounds the holy spirit while you're a street fighter resting in these problems maybe you're crippled maybe you're blind maybe you can't hear maybe you can't see maybe you're sick heart trouble cancer or something die except the light tonight and rust up on it and the wind coming like a russian mighty wind on the day of pentecost will move down to that and open up a way for you hallelujah that you'll patch right through that valley of sickness right back into the land of health again you'll pass right through that land of cold farm will shackle down in different religions to a holy excuse me i'm getting too loud showing redemption by power he showed the blood back down one thing he showed his power here by his blood through redemption showed his power to escape death through the blood he showed his power to make a way of escape by redemption of power and today you who have accepted amen you who have accepted the blood of jesus christ to cleanse you from sin the power of the holy ghost to lead you to the baptism of the holy ghost the power of god is here to transform you from sickness to health god moving on in the exodus of the church he's coming into the blossom where god will gather after holly's green wonderful coming out of the darkness into the marvelous life how we love that how i do what that means to my soul tonight friends you i'm talking to a man today who just met me while i was out and he said i've been trying to tell people that i've changed your life billy since you as the kids that used to come by you tell me at my place of business that i want to get right with god i want to be right with god and said i things have changed now but i don't know now what you speak of praise god he said i'll try to tell others about it so they'll change the subject go talk about a funny paper or something audience me this next dollar a corner he may die he's the next one maybe his number is back to not knowing whose number is next it may be yours tonight friends this may be the time god calls you god the great holy spirit standing here tonight between death and life standing here between sickness and health i know what i speak of that's right right now the same holy spirit that you feel that every born-again person is bound to feel that spirit in the room you can't help it if you got in your life you know it's there all right i like a magnet with a great magnet coming here in the material it begins to move and crawl why coal street gets like a big magnet come down up here one time a hammond indiana was watching take up shavens on the floor they pulled a big big lever down from a great big magnet they had all the shavings swept out in the middle of four as it passed by all those shavings that was magnified to the magnet irons looked right up and went with the magnet out that demagnetized it dropped it into the cuboid and molded it again there's a lot of aluminum shavings left i said why didn't they go he said they're not magnetized to the magnet i said praise god i said why don't these go down here in the cease iron so if you know it's just bolted down that's not like a lot of people tonight friends you become a church member but not magnetized by the baptism of the holy ghost then you let something shackle you down something different shackle you down but one of these days there's a great magnet coming from these call the son of god that'll sweep this land and every person that's dead and crush our eyes and those bodies will be transformed and made us unto his own glorious fight for we shall live forever and ever free from sickness free from all age and everything else and the glory of god will live in his blessed presence forever amen don't let that scare you i feel religious right now i sure do all right well i know that my redeemer liveth and at the last days you'll stand on this earth though the skin once destroyed this body yet in my flesh all i see god you are just keeping myself my eyes shall be holding out another don't think i'm crazy i'm not if i am just let me alone i'm more happier just when it was the other way yes sir just let me say this away oh sure it's crazy to the world all those things that the world calls crazy god calls blessings you have to lose your mind to this world because what you're not out of this world when you cross all that separating lines [Music] [Music] oh my change from this what you are now you are now the sons of god now are we sitting together in heavenly places now we will be in the millennium we are now right now with the sons of god right now we're sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus not just in the church where christ jesus the resurrected lord jesus the sheriff he's sharing his power he's sharing his redemption power he shared for the exodus he shall bring every church member into fellowship with him [Music] into your life and make you a new creature you're a few years ago all the religions of the world met i believe in london or somewhere i don't remember exactly but when he was all speaking for different churches and muhammad from the buddhism everything a little a fellow that represented the american homeless church john witt i believe was his name so then when he got up his time to speak all the religions represented in this great gathering he told the story of lady maccabee how low she was got arrested in oklahoma with a seagull in her mouth driving her breaking the speed law going through the streets with a stagecoach she had done so many murders and so filthy and so armory until when they went to tar and feathers they wouldn't put their hands on afraid to be polluted and when he got the story told in such a dramatic way however the listener was sitting on the ends of his feet he said gentlemen other religions of this world has your religion got anything that would clean the hands of lady maccabee nobody said a word he jumped up in here and kicked his heels together he said the blood of jesus christ will only clean her hand but it will clean her heart amen that's right the blood of jesus christ will take the lord prostitute louisville kentucky and make a lady's fate out of here he'll take the good lager out of the place and make a gentleman out of him and a saint of god my friends citizens of the kingdom my fellow man of kentucky and indiana and around about don't you think tonight it's about time for you to consider this lord jesus before your last chance taken when you see the church going in this great exodus see the pillar of afar leading before standing performing miracles and times he's sure tonight in all his redeeming power he's sure to make whole ever sinner back [Music] gospel and we preach the full gospel feed the whole lamb roast it with the holy ghost and know that it's good eating for the holy spirit has divined to us that it is real good taste and see the lord is good it tastes like honey in the rod our lord jesus christ and his love and power and his great redemptive blessings oh how he stands between the church and sin tonight how he stands between you and judgment bleeding playing here although i walked into a place up here in ohio where i had been just about to pass my opinion of judgment i've been eating a little duncan restaurant which had a great meeting i had to stay several miles out in the country at a little motel i've been eating at a dunkirk restaurant nice lovely people and on sunday they closed and went to church i had to go across to an ordinary little common american place to eat my dinner when i walked into the door to my surprise there stood up state police put his arm around the girl playing the slot machine now gambling is illegal in ohio and there is a law about himself breaking the law and perhaps the man at my age perhaps married to the family somewhere with his arms around some young lady standing there i look back across the reference some boys sitting back there drunk and a young lady not acting morally at all i was sitting down to my right side here to a boost which i was ready to sit down that said an elderly lady somewhat around 58 60 years old old is my mother sitting there skin all anchored up a little bitty clothes on and all it was terrible and her toenails painted purple lips painted purple the harvest didn't fight you ever seen her hair cut real sharp and streamed up like that and she was drinking that's the two men with us sitting there horribly looking drunk one of them laying across the place of the table and when they excuse themselves and went out to the restroom i said that oh god how can you stand it how can you look at such as that when even in my heart mind as bad as i am if still i wonder if my little karen rebecca will have to raise up in such a generation to see that coming on lord why don't you just wipe it off from the face here uh why don't you just do it large i sat down there and just started weeping i saw a vision i saw as it was the world whirling around in the air and there stood a rainbow around that world and someone that was speaking to me that that's the blood of jesus christ around this world that keeps him from destroyed if god can see sin the day thereof that day you die every man under that blood there has a free moral agent to take your choice but if you ever die and your soul soars beyond the mercy of that blood you're already judged before you get there there's nothing left for you then i've seen myself i see my lord jesus standing there put a count of thorns on his head and the tears running down mixed up his blood as it was washed off with his beard and i seen my sins coming before him and every time he would come before him i guess he was shaking the thorns just sticking his round or his stagger back his state tolerance for giving he don't know what he's doing and again i would do something and then his blood was like the bumper on the car protecting the car a shielding me from the wrath of god undeserving now come to him slowly knelt down to him i said look down there laying in front and there was an old book of sin and my name wrote across the top i said lord will you forgive me certainly he said with loving eyes reached to his side got some blood out and rolled on its heart and sold it back to forgetfulness he said now i said thank you lord he said now i forgive you and you're condemning her oh that changed the picture for me i come out of it i walked over there and sat down to her and began to talk and she had some rough life back before i said well you never christian she said i was raised in a christian home i said what happened she told me about him missed you with her husband and our children and so forth i said all these years you've never lived peaceful since you met god she said earth that is the truth and i said won't you receive him right now she said would he take me i said he's knocking at your heart now and out of that boot there in the floor knelt down before that audience of people slot machines top boulders cursing stops and everything else i lifted up my hands with my hands that pull wrinkle hands and letter to jesus christ that's it friends don't look jesus i don't care what you've done how black your sins are how smutty your life is god's standing tonight knocking at your heart's door to forgive you no matter who you are that's valid sister come to your argument with you heavenly father oh i pray that you will just now while the holy spirit's moving in the building let us seek first the kingdom to find favor with you and then i believe you'll heal the sick but right now father while feeling that there's a great deep interest and a conviction people knowing that your church is in the exodus and we're going on towards judgment not knowing that in the morning someone may come to the bedside and they're wearing and gone this time tomorrow night may be in a marriage somewhere and i was told i got an eternity oh god this may be the last hour this may be the last chance that man will receive many no doubters studying here men and women who is his god who has lived just a normal good life but never been born again doesn't know what it means to be filled with the holy spirit a complete surrendered life with all the shame and bastionalist taken from them and god's spirit baptized them into his mercy god is here won't you tonight in the name of thy beloved child jesus moved to every heart and speak just now and may they in the simplicity of their heart raise up their hearts disease raise their heart and

get me to do different you've tried to make me to make that stranger but now the day is far spent lord with me but i'm ready to come now granted father while mercy is calling before judgment the exodus of the church is leading egypt may they come go along with the great group as a called out he asks it in his name and while we have her heads bowed and i closed her christian spring i wonder if

anointing there's too many now putting just emphasis on the letter of the word letter of the word letter of the message but brother what are we ignoring the holy ghost are ignoring the holy spirit he's there he's there to make the word live in us praise the lord hallelujah so i pray the grace of god amen that we have re we have redemption praise the lord but make sure we have the power of redemption amen brother there's too many as the word they have the message but not the power of the message oh no they got the letter that's why to many is no more than a denomination oh we believe this we believe this we believe that brother you don't have to say it just live it by the grace of god there's too many out there feeling there oh all i got to say all i got to do is tell them i believe this tell them i believe that brother if you really got it in your heart you won't have to tell them you they'll see it he's living in you by the grace of god oh so i pray grace brother that we are we have experienced god's redemption amen by god's power the power of god again is christ that liveth in me amen by the grace of god and if christ is in you power's in you oh yeah there's a lot a lot professed to have jesus it's christ in me the hope of glory well it's good let me see christ in you you won't have to tell this person or tell that person they'll see it they'll know amen that the life you live is the life of jesus and the life you live is it must be god in you it's gotta be the lord in you amen for you to do this do this and do that and you and you wanna you wanna please the lord amen you got that right attitude you got that right spirit you got that right motive and you got the right objective amen all lined up with the word amen so brother there's there's many as it were a believer but their motive is still not word but their objective is not the word and yeah so again they're doing what they want to do but are you doing what god wants you to do or what do you mean to tell me in the natural power of oh yeah even if it's a sister in a in her home or brothers in their jobs or even some of their sisters in their jobs but you got to do what god wants you to do how god wants you to do it when god wants you to do it where god wants you to do it not my will thine be done oh yeah brother we all got to face that challenge well our lord did well well he faced it well just do this just do that no he went he went to the garden of gethsemane and he and he knelt down and he prayed and he cried and he prayed and he cried yeah and i finally got to the place where he just said not my will father thine be done because what he did have he did have that that anointing in the flesh of god and and of the power knowing you've got eternal life that's why oh my that's why he he he said how long shall i be with you how much lord oh lord he wanted to go you know like he said there's no man that ended up only he that came down even the son of man who is in heaven because he wanted to get back he wanted to well he couldn't put up with sin no more he couldn't confront with the unbelief of the world no more oh yeah death and no matter where wherever he looked i guess what jesus was seeing more than anything he was seeing the devil oh yeah he knew there was that the devil calls this the devil calls that but brother what he was really really looking for the response he was looking for was the love of god in the people that's why when he came back to peter he challenged him he challenged him you think as i said the other night you think he would have gotten john the revelator to be there on the day of pentecost to give forth the message and so on but no he chose peter peter was the one on the day of pentecost he got up he spoke the word amen but jesus did dealt with peter love us thou me more than these do you love god more than you love anything else or anyone else amen you're more devoted to jesus than you are anyone else well my brother i got to be devoted to this or through that one or that one no no you've got to be devoted to jesus you really can't be rightly devoted to the others if you're not devoted to him amen no no and you really can't go out and do this what you feel is the will of god you can't do it rightly honest you're you're devoted to him amen and he's in control so it's not you that lives christ lives in you now
