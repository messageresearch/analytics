and where we are we pass Lord let us set aside Lord every besetting sin Lord every fault every failure every flaw Ed every draw of this world or to draw close to you we pray grant us Grace now we pray Jesus in your name we're asking it amen amen God bless you this evening thank you musicians you turn your scriptures to First Peter chapter 1 First Peter chapter one they may not have certainly been rejoicing over the news of the sale of the church so quickly considering it took the last uh the last owner a year and a half to sell it and we lowballed him heavily um and for us to be able to sell it for for what we did in as easily as we did we're just believing that was the Lord's work amen so we're very thankful for that certainly appreciate the hard work of the trustees to get us this far and just trusting the Lord to get us across that finish line but certainly looking forward to a place where we can have more time and fellowship and and draw closer together in the bonds of unity and love amen so I'm so thankful for that God is good and uh you know as as they were saying it goes quick and then when God wants to do something he can do it quick if he wants to amen and so we're just trusting he's in it and we're thankful for it and just want to make sure we each put our shoulder to the wheel where we're asked where we can help we want to do that to support our trustees and the body in general amen amen God bless you we're going to read from First Peter 1 and verse 18 says for as much as you know that ye were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's catch that see normally Redemption comes by payment through silver and gold through money he says the redeeming you need was from your vain conversation your vain life that you received from your fathers it had become a tradition to them amen it was no longer life it was no longer relationship it was just tradition to them he says you can't be redeemed from that with money you can't be redeemed from that with things that are corrupted with things that are natural of this Earth he says but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening I was kind of expecting to be able to keep my jacket on this evening giving that somebody ordered up winter all of a sudden but I'm feeling pretty warm up here amen so God bless you this evening we're going to continue our series on Redemption and and I want to preach on a wonderful thing tonight I want to preach on a title called debt free and then debt free we hear a lot about debt these days don't we we've been through a pandemic where the government spent almost a trillion dollars and put us into debt almost a trillion dollars in the last three years almost and we look at that and we see our provincial government and they get a surplus and it makes the news because we had a surplus rather than we went into further and further debt you know we have a half billion dollar Surplus and we have what 10 or 12 billion dollars sitting in the background that we can't pay off amen we have unpayable debts already as a country and as a province and we see it even happening in our personal lives don't we we see that the the economists look at it and they say personal debt is ratcheting Higher and Higher and Higher and now 25 30 50 of your income is going to different kinds of debt and they've got people in some of the higher cost areas of the country where 80 and 90 percent of their their money is going to debt a lot of that's for housing of course but personal debt and and people racking up their credit cards and these things and they look at it and they say that it's unsustainable you know when we look at those things and we know that we don't get in debt by making the right decisions do we you don't uh generally I mean obviously there are those that have harder times and I remember I was in debt early on in my life and you're you're young and you buy a house and you're not making a whole lot of money and maybe you go into debt for certain things but as you make a better living and as you make more money you pull yourself out from it amen and if you can live within your means you don't have to go into debt except for the most you know maybe a house on these different things but you see that debt is built up on poor decisions usually amen and we speak about Redemption tonight and we know that as soon as Adam as soon as Adam sinned that a debt was created right there and it was a debt that he could never pay and since that time since the very the very moment that time began that we stepped out of Eternity and into time there's a lifestyle that we were living that started building up a sin debt and every day that we lived there was a sin that that was being built up and more and more and more of these things amen our very existence as we preached on before was a reflection of the original sin every breath we took was a reminder of the sinful way that we came into this world and then you think about how many people have lived in the world this far and that would live until the Lord would come in the very end of time you would see that great debt of sin that was built up and you could see God standing there before time ever begins and knowing the end from the beginning he could look and he see where time began because time began when sin began when sin came into the world and he would see that great mountain of debt built up over time and we can't even comprehend that but I'm going to try and give us maybe a way to to look at that remember I remember way back when in one of the special meetings I preached here before we moved I spoke about how big a book would be if you sinned one hour once an hour every day of your life and when we look at what Sin is Sin is unbelief sin is not just saying the wrong thing or or having the wrong attitude or responding the wrong way but sin is even the wrong thought the wrong motive and the wrong objective so the holiest among us if we could say I only sin 24 times a day we would be in really great company we would be among the greatest people on the Earth in terms of our Holiness such as we would label it 24 times a day if I if my book of sin if my sin that book was 24 a day and each of those sins was only one word lusted cheated lied one word by the end of my life if I lived 75 years the rough average for a North American these days I'd have 1600 pages of sin one word descriptions for my entire life that's a lot of debt it's a lot of sins they say we have a hundred and Seventeen billion people that have existed in the earth thus far so you take 117 billion people and you multiply them by the roughly 657 000 sins that they would do in their life or 1600 pages of that and you would stack those books in standard five by eight inch format you would have a a stack that is one and a half million kilometers tall and that would be all the sins of the world in one words in one word descriptions that's it no details just one word and that'd be enough to convict us you could go around the world 38 times almost with that stack of sins you could go to the Moon back and back all the way to the moon and back twice with a stack of those books and that would be the sin debt of the world so far that's the mountain that God could see from the very beginning when there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world that's the debt that he was putting up against the Lamb of God that's how big it was we start looking at something like that you take all of those sins those one-word sins and say each of those is worth a dollar which is cheap for a sin when you think about it considering what a dollar buys you today we would owe eight quadrillion dollars in Cinder at a dollar a piece and we only do 24 a day each person it would take us 812 years if we took every bit of the gross domestic product of the entire Earth and put every cent against that debt it would take us 812 years to pay it off that's if we didn't pay anything for anything if we didn't have any food if we didn't have any energy if we didn't have any clothes nothing if we took every cent we had it would take us 812 years of every bit of money that we produce in this world anything that's of value 812 years to pay it off which you can't do of course you can't do you can't put everything into your debt because you have to live and so it's an unpayable debt now you look at that and you say that's a dollar a piece but consider this that every single one of those debts was worthy of death so it was eight quadrillion deaths that would have been required looking from the very beginning of time that's the mountain of debt that that we've built up if the numbers are to be correct ever since Adam first fell in the garden that's the price that has to be paid for us that's the price each one of us would be over six hundred and fifty thousand dollars at a dollar a sin to pay off you say well I can do that I can pay off a house like that they're doing it all day long in Vancouver and Toronto try paying that off while you live in those places with interest because you got to pay interest God doesn't do free financing does he that's the debt that we're talking about on the best day if you stayed in bed and did nothing you'd still have that mountain of debt behind you screaming guilty guilty guilty Isaiah 64. says this it says we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness says righteousness is you know what stands out to me righteousnesses because we would say all our righteousness righteousness is things that we do that we think somehow certify us in front of God that qualifies to be in his presence that's what he's saying all of our righteousness is all the things we do that think of that that we allow to take us into God's presence it says every one of them are as filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf we know all about that in the season and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away you can't get close to God because the wind takes you as a leaf and it's blowing you away because you're an iniquity that can't be in the presence of God he says there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirth up himself to take hold of thee for thou Hast hid thy face from us and Hast consumed us because of our iniquities what he says none of us could approach God none of us could reach up effectively and grab hold of God and say Have Mercy On Us on the best day all we could do is Scream have mercy because we could never touch him we could never get close enough into his presence to lay hold of him and have any sort of an effect on him amen wretched lost incomplete dissatisfied unable to get the victory that's what we were looking at to pay amen what would you do to pay it what would you do if somebody would offer to take care of every sin in your life what price would you pay if you knew that it would restore you to Eternal fellowship and eternal life with God what would you pay it's a question we ought to ask ourselves what would you be willing to pay we see in the dark ages what would they do they do these great pilgrimages wouldn't they and they go to Jerusalem or they go to Rome or they go to some place that was declared as a holy site and some of these people would crawl for hundreds even thousands of miles the entire way it would take them years to get there and they would destroy their bodies and their joints trying to get there doing what doing Penance doing something in a humble way something that was difficult to show God how serious they were about having their sin debt paid or for the sake of one of their relatives that they knew wasn't good enough to get in to do Penance they would do these amazing things remember we read the story of Martin Luther and he sees these people going up and down the stairs right and they're doing Penance and they're going up and down those Stone stairs that are so cold and so hard and ripping up their knees and that's when he got the Revelation that what the just shall live by faith but they were trying to justify themselves by what doing acts of penance of Holiness of great sacrifice and hopes that they could pay the debt off for somebody they pay great sums to the Catholic Church just for the opportunity to get their family out of what Purgatory hell a place where they could stay for a while maybe get them out a little quicker from these places it's incredible the things that people would do and you see God looking at that and and I think sometimes we could sit back and say why is God so harsh to us why doesn't he reach out to us in that way why doesn't he see that we're trying to do something and reach out and say all I'll take that why does he seem so so standoffish at times looking back through history is what I'm talking about not today of course amen why could we not move the needle of his compassion towards us in Goodwill why couldn't we do it brother Brown would say this in the latest in church age he said these things saith the faithful and true witness now I want to show you what I find in the thought of faithful you know we often talk about a great unchanging God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it is as though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and became a great impersonal God it is as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind that being the cross and then when the death of Christ has atoned for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him God just folded his arms and stood back because you see what happened through here and there was no closeness there was this great thing in the middle but it just seems like God let it go to pot as we would say today right he just let the world go into shambles he let it go back into chaos he let it go into a lost condition so often just total darkness there was no God there was no Holy Ghost for most of it just completely died away he said it is as if we majored in believing in a great Creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation you say I don't think that brother John sometimes we do we get into situations we get into the depths of Despair we get into difficult times we get amen he knows what's good for us amen he's saying God is working in our lives and for our good even when we can't see it and catch this even when we don't deserve it because why he has a personal interest he is has a vested interest because he has given a word and it can return to him void so he has a personal interest in losing the Holy Spirit to produce that which he has called for us to produce in this time and in this age amen and we see that in this unpayable sin debt we look at it and we ask and we say what would it be worth to you to restore yourself back to the presence of God now if you really believed that I could get you back to the presence of God what would you pay I'd pay everything I pay everything if I knew beyond a shadow of doubt that whoever this person was standing before me could restore me back to my original condition my original position and give me eternal life in the presence of God I give anything up I give anything up because what he's giving me is worth way more than anything I have if you value the presence of God so what would you pay for it if no you say I pay anything but what would you say if somebody said I'll give it to you for free you've already said what you'll say you've already decided what you're going to say John coffee has decided what he will say amen he says I'll take it I'll take it and so many times what's happening is people say if you offer me that I take it and yet it's standing right there before you and people won't take it they won't take it because what they don't believe it they don't believe it or they're not looking for it it has no value to them amen brother bam says this way he says God is building a church as a memorial a memorial of his sacrifice Christ never come to Earth to die in vain his death will not be in vain he said God is able of these stones to rise up children unto Abraham if people won't live it if they won't take it under consideration and realize what a great gift that God has given them God is able of the stones to raise children to Abraham truly he'll do it and when I think of that and think of the great price that we had to pay everything everybody wants everything free that's the American way of life today get everything you can for nothing I'm reminded even of what happened when brother Mark you know the first one of all of us really to get saved to come to the Lord and it was what kind of like out of these Stones I'll produce a child I'll raise up children are these Stones because guess what there are Pentecostals all over this island that were a whole lot closer to the knowledge of what it meant to be his son and a daughter of God right the prophet was calling them out over the the previous 30 40 50 years they should have been called out and they weren't and they didn't and so what did God do God raised up a young man that had no clue what God really was and took him and pulled them into the fold and then from there he pulled in another one and another one and another one and then he brings in a pastor and all of a sudden we've got 40 or 50 people in a church Faithfully serving him why because one stone was turned into a child of God now we believe he was always a child of God of course we believe that but out of nothing out of nowhere out of out of the strangest place out of somebody just walking down the street a heathen in so many ways that's what we would say if you're Catholic you're heathen no idea what it means to serve God and out of that turns them into a holy ghost-filled Son of God he can do it out of nothing and he can do it out of the strangest places he says brother you get nothing that's worth anything for nothing you pay for what you get that's right you have to pay for it and it comes dear he says and your salvation come dear to God it costs his only begotten son to give eternal life to every man and make him happy tonight and live for things that's worthwhile Living For you not for to leave something to our children said we died but if we die he says this is not what you're looking for is to leave something to your children he says this is what you want to leave to your children eternal life life that's worth living for he says no Heritage to be left greater than the salvation of our Lord Jesus Christ he's made a way he's made a way and it's through the blood of the Lamb now I'm going to Romans 5 and I know we've read this a few times but it it's worth repeating and Paul says for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly what's he pointing to he's pointing to the mountain of debt and we didn't even know we were wrong didn't even know we were wrong we weren't under the Covenant we had no clue who God was who the real God was and that we had a price to pay we had no clue he says first scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet Perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die but God commendeth his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners all of us all of us were Sinners all of us are sinners until we're under that blood he says while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him as I was reading this we have all these initiatives these days that working in the world and they call it EDI Equity diversity and inclusion amen and it's what it's trying to level the playing field they're trying to bring more women into work and they're trying to bring more people of color and more indigenous people and and the transgender and and lgbtq and all these things they're trying to bring more and more of them into work and make sure that they get all of the opportunities that everyone else apparently does listen this is the greatest EDI program that was ever given to the world because he says while we were all yet sinners that covers Every Nation every color every gender everything you might have wrong with you is included in that he says while you are yet sinners he died for you this is the greatest equalizer that was ever in the history of mankind as he said while you are yet sinners I die for you I paid the price and he didn't care who and what you were every sin price was paid that day there's no sin price that's not paid today you say what about a Sinners his price was paid and the only reason he doesn't get the benefit of it is because he doesn't receive the pardon but his prices paid but he doesn't receive the pardon and so he's got to go a different path Paul continues he says for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life not only so but also we joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned verse 15 says but not as the orphans so also is the free gift we're talking about debt free tonight he says so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift by Grace which is one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many he says one man brought us into that one man's going to bring us out and it's a free gift and it's a gift of Grace you cannot earn it it is on merited favor he says and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses under justification for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which received the abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore is by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of One Man the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life every man it's available it's available to every single person on the planet always has been and always will be he says for as by one man's disobedient many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offense might abound Paul says the Sin didn't didn't didn't exist until the law was given you could do anything but until the law says it's wrong it's not sin but he says as soon as Allah entered then what offenses might abound now you could you could sin and you could sin a whole lot he says but where sin abounded Grace did much more abound amen he says that has sin hath reigned unto death even so my grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord it jumps out of me where he says rain because what does it mean if you Reign it means you are the king it means you are the ultimate deciding Authority on what happens in the kingdom and he says listen Grace is what's going to rain all the way until you come into that Perfection of eternal life in Christ Jesus I'm so glad I'm under a Grace Reign this morning this evening amen that he doesn't look at me that he looks at a perfect sacrifice that he doesn't look at my many faults and failures my flaws what does he look at he looks through a lens of Grace and he says what I see a perfect lamb I see a perfect sacrifice sitting over there Hebrews 9 says but Christ being come and high Priests of good things to come isn't that a wonderful thing that you have a high priest of good things to come that's the kind of high priest I want because under the love of sin and death and under the law of the blood of bulls and goats he would only do it for a year and guess what I don't know if there was ever a year where that high priest didn't come out because remember he went in first for himself and then if he came out alive then he went in for you can you imagine if he went in and died that was not a priest that went in into good things was it but this one goes into what good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is the same not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us jumping down to 24 it says for Christ is not entered into the holy Place made with hands which are the figures of the true he says but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us see the high priest had to go into what the holy of holies down here on Earth and he had to go into the presence of God and he had to go in first for himself and then he had to go in if God accepted that sacrifice and that blood then he came out and he got more blood and he went in for the sins of the people as well and then if he came out still alive then the sins of the people were put off for another year he says Christ didn't go into that Temple he says he went directly to Heaven he went directly into the presence of the father and he says he only won him once that's all it was required because what he was the blood he was the blood he wasn't carrying blood he was the blood the sins of the people were with him and when that was accepted it settled the sin question forever he says into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entireth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then he must have often suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world had he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself now I I bolded it or I I I oversized that that phrase there put away because you've got to realize that under the sin of death your sins weren't put away they were covered remember we preached a couple Services ago we said when I see the blood I will do what pass over you he didn't say the sins were gone he says I'll look past them they're covered he can see it's like if I covered this Pulpit with a tarp and that tarp was the blood and the pulpit was your sins he could see there were sins but he couldn't he couldn't tell the details of them because they were under the blood they were covered but they still existed so he knew there was a problem he knew there were issues but the blood covered it and it took what it knew that it settled his wrath so that he could move on and he could show you Grace and he could show you mercy and these different things amen the details were hidden from him but we see when Christ comes and even early on as just as he's coming to John and John Cena and says the next day John see it Jesus coming to him and say Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world and when you look at those words taketh away it means to disannull to abolish in another place brother Branham says that he he divorced Sin from us there was a complete and total separation of The Sinner from his sin because before it just covered it but now he says there's a separation of who you are and what you did and if you can separate that then you can stand with who you are and not be judged because your sin is over here and it's being judged aside from you and God doesn't impute it to you God doesn't see it connected to you and so in that separation there's a righteousness that comes but there needs to be a Separation by A Perfect sacrifice and Paul and John both said that when he came he didn't just atone for sin like the blood of bulls and goats and lambs and doves but he separated it this atonement was the perfect atonement in that he separated you from your faults and failures from all the things that you had ever done amen brother Brian would say this this is 1965 exactly a month before the day he died he's talking about this this this annulment of your sin he says you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning he says this is my message to the church now he knows he's going off the scene the seals have been opened he's done everything that his ministry was supposed to do and he says you've got to realize Church you're free everything that you've ever done everything you will do he says you never did it in the first place that's his message to the church just before he goes off the scene he says you are standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every Tittle where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them Shucks and get out here in the weep where you can get right before the sun he says I hear the coming of the combine he says there's a preparation being made and the time is now to ripen you've got to pull away from everything that's ever been before you you've got to separate yourself from everything he says I hear the coming of the combine what's the combine it's the big machine that harvests anyone that's been in Saskatchewan in particular would know all about those in Alberta massive machines just going and they're just rotating and grabbing up all the wheat and the canola and these things he says you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah talk about it Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God and every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned in the first place you are perfect he says the blood of Jesus Christ you're standing there perfect you're standing there Justified he says you never did it in the first place what's he trying to get the people away from doing stop trying to pay for it stop trying to atone for it stop trying to be worthy of it stop beating yourself up you're under grace he's not looking at you you don't have to be beat up you don't have to be pushed down you don't have to be stuck in a rut you never did it in the first place sometimes we're trying to do what qualify ourselves for the good things of God we already read how many times they say it is a free gift it is a free gift it is a gift of Grace is a gift of his atonement his blood his qualifications it's free it's free it's free you're free so he says why are you stuck here time's moving he's coming for us get ready to go and stop trying to justify yourself in his eyes step back into his grace and let him work through your life the way that he's been wanting to do for 2000 years since the first church get out of your own head get out of your own thinking get out of trying to deserve the blessings of God you don't deserve it you'll never deserve it I don't deserve it I don't deserve to be here this evening but he said I should be here he called me here by a free gift and he paid my debt and he paid the price and so I can stand here free this evening because he says you are free scripture says he who the son sets free is free indeed you don't have to pretend when you're free you know when you're free you don't have to pretend to know the the joy of God in your life you don't have to pretend to know the peace you don't have to put on a front because you got it you got it you don't have to pretend these things the worst thing is when we put up a facade that we have something that we don't as a Believer instead of crying out and say I want the free gift that's all he's waiting for you to do ask says you have not because you ask not I think sometimes we have not because we're trying to get it ourselves rather than saying it's a free gift Lord and that goes for deliverance that goes for healing that goes for the spirit of Praise in your life that goes for joy goes for love goes for rest you can't work yourself into rest whoever got Rest by work you can't do it it's a free gift that's what he paid the price for there's these misconceptions about punishment and pain these days I feel I want to share something with you because people think that if they're going through pain then God is punishing them absolutely absolutely and not just in the denominations right here in the message people think that if I'm in pain God is punishing me listen every bit of punishment that you deserve Christ took so any pain you're going through today is not punishment it's not punishment I'll prove it to you now everybody goes back to Galatians 6 7 and says be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap and they look and they say well look I'm reaping what I sowed I did wrong and now God is punishing me I'm hurting because I did wrong no no no because guess what this scripture is a blessing and it's a curse because if you saw the right thing you'll rape the right thing and if you saw the wrong thing you'll get the wrong thing my favorite saying I think in in these situations is do stupid things win stupid prizes right so this is not a law of punishment and blessing this is a law of what Harvest what you put in is what you get out God doesn't have to do anything to you you put it in you're going to get it out and as a believer that does not exclude you you are not excluded from this you do the wrong thing you'll get the wrong thing out every single time but listen what's going to happen is that God to his children acts in a different way than he does to those that are not his children remember what if you're going through pain as a Believer it is always with purpose and there's two reasons for it and the first one is that you're going through purification because God sees something in your life that needs to come out so what does he do he puts you in uncomfortable positions to bring that issue to the Forefront that flaw that characteristic that attribute that attitude whatever it might be and he puts you under pressure so that that comes out and it causes what pain it causes stress it causes discomfort it causes a shame sometimes because we react and we do things that we ought not to do and what's he doing is he's putting you in uncomfortable positions to do what pull it out of you because remember he says in Revelation 3 when he's talking to the Legacy and church age he says I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire he says I counsel thee he says he doesn't say I'm going to force you he says I counsel you to submit to it because gold is what Godly character and what you can only purify gold in a fire you can beat on it and you can sort it out and you can put it in the in the pan you know and get all the dirt away but there comes a place there where you get that fire has to go into the fire and get all of the impurity Zone and so that pain is purification he's not punishing you he's bringing you to a state of perfection but so often we say because it hurts I did wrong no no no if you didn't hurt I would be worried about your Christian condition because he's always working on us amen but on the other side is what chastisement because remember he says in Hebrews 12 we'll get to it a minute chastisement we think that what again I did something bad and so he's giving me a spanking because what do we do with our kids if they do something wrong we give them a spanking we say that's what God is doing no no that's not the way chastisement Works do you know the root word for chastisement teaching and we get it so wrong as parents is that they do something wrong and we spank them first and teach second no no God always gives us the word first and what does he do he says here's the right thing to do and he does it over the pulpit he does it through our parents he does it through the people in our church it messages whatever it might be and he gives you that teaching and then he says will you live by it and then if you don't do it then what does he do he chastises you he gives you a spanking it's not punishment what's he trying to do he's trying to let you know you don't want to do this I don't spank my kid I shouldn't spank my kid kids because I'm angry I should spank it to keep them from doing it again for their sake because if they do it it's going to cause a lot more pain it's going to cause a lot more discomfort it's going to be a lot worse than if they continue it doing in it now remember this is Hebrews 12. you got to realize chastisement is not paying just for the sake of punishment it's pain that is given for a purpose Hebrews 12 says and have ye forgotten the exhortation with speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth we'd say spanking these days we don't we don't whip most of us he says he spanks every son that he receives the ones that he's working with the ones that he is has welcomed into his home the ones that he has what vested interest in because he has that vested interest in every person in the world but the sons that he has received the ones that he's bringing to him those are the ones that he spanks he says if you and they're chastening God dealer with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not that ought to tell us whether or not we ought to spank our kids but if he be without chastisement where of all our partakers then are ye bastards and not Sons so Paul's saying God if you're a child of God he doesn't let you get away with anything anything I'm a testimony to that he doesn't let you get away with anything nothing why because if he sees you going down the wrong road the first thing he's going to do is try and holler at you and say don't go down that road so what does he do he takes it and it's love that drives it it's not frustration it's not disappointment it's not shame that is not the way God operates he is a god of love so everything is operated under love and so what is he doing is he sees you going a certain direction and what does he do listen if an unbeliever goes down that road God just lets him go and in the end they get a lot of pain don't they but it's what reaping what they sowed but you start down that road as a son or a daughter of God and what does he do he ratchets the pain up to 11. on a scale of one to ten he ratchets it up to 11. why because he loves you like brother Brahm said if you've got a kid that's out in the middle of the road you don't come out and say now little Johnny you shouldn't play in that road he says you go out there and you grab him up and You Yank him off that road why because the pain of being hit by the truck that's coming is way worse than what you just did to him if it wrenches his neck you know if it strains his shoulder socket doesn't matter because what you're doing is way better than what's going to happen if he goes down there so that's what God does to us believe her so many times is we go down the road and what does he do he just cranks up the paint all he's doing is he's saying you do not want to go down this path because what's down there is way worse than what I'm doing to you right now and I love you too much to let you get those scars hold up there reverse your decision come back do the right thing don't do the wrong thing go the way that I've taught you to go and you'll be okay and all of a sudden the pain goes away and guess what as long as we learn then the pain is done you never have to go back again amen and then the unbeliever right next to you they go down the same road and they reap a whirlwind because they don't have a Godly father they don't have a loving father that's looking over them so pain is not punishment pain is love trying to get you back to the way that he wants you to be amen and that chastisement is a reflection of your position it's a reflection of your heritage and if you don't have it Paul says you're not even a child of God because those who he loves he always corrects I mean I'm speaking of pain a lot just in this moment because pain is the price that was paid Christ went through an awful lot of pain so that we don't have to take punishment pain so we don't have to take the beating and the whipping and all of these things that he went through amen we spoke last service I think it was about how his ministry alone was painful and every day he was tired and when he laid his head down at night he could barely sleep just sore and in agony and people pulling and pushing at him and doing all these things and we saw it aged him prematurely he was half again as old in appearance than he was in real life and that was a great price that he paid but in the last 24 hours before he died he went through a level of pain he went through a level of punishment he went through a level of suffering that we cannot even imagine we can't even imagine what it was like just his life would have been difficult and why did he do it listen I'd have been happy if he just took my sins away because if he just went to the cross and died my sins would have been covered but he did a lot more than go to that cross and die before he died didn't he he did a lot of really uncomfortable things I want to talk about that for a little bit we read this last service he said in Isaiah 53 he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely have borne our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did a scene esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed that's an awful lot of pain and suffering crammed into one verse wounded bruised chastisement and striped whipped just in one thing it covers the greatest pain that a man in this world has ever gone through brother Brown said this he says the Bible said this man was marred above all men he was marred so much till he didn't even look like a son of man he was beaten he was bruised he was Bloody he was striped everything that could be done he looked like just a big pile of Blood and Bones walking together he didn't even look like a human being as he drug that up Calvary he said God smote him for us that's what makes him the perfect Masterpiece oh how I love him know that he did that for me know that he did that for you how could we match it no one could match it no one's worthy to match it we were here without hope we were without god without any way of redemption every one of us born sexual and we just had to pay the price but he came the perfect one and was so perfect and so pleasing till God smote him for you and I so perfect that God had to strike him because what he was exactly what God required LeBron says then I hear that howling mob in our scene look at him there they're crying for his blood his own children screaming out away with him their creator their God their maker their father away with him now he's become their redeemer he's speaking as Christ now he says now they reject me they don't know who I am they don't know I'm the very one that pronounces curse upon them Yonder in the Garden of Eden I've come down to redeem them if I refuse why I could speak in Legions of angels would come to me but if I would they're going to be lost and after all I was the one that put the curse on them now I'm going to come to take the curse off of them and let them through their sins crucify me he says there he goes dragging through the street beat they backed him hooked him up to a pulse like this and put a cat of nine tails stood out there and beefed till his ribs showed through he was a little man the Bible said no beauty that we should desire him look at his body beaten Riven bruised mockery spit from his own children spitting in their daddy's face a crown of thorns on his head tears and things mingle running down his body tears and blood running together and spit dropping off here he comes we'll look out the window and see what he looks like there he goes I hear his old cross dragging through the streets making a roaring bumpy noise as it goes down his poor little body's moving and they're walking along whipping him with a whip and the Very Creator moving there in flesh that's that blood cell moving up he says just bathing down his back he moves a little further let's look I notice over his back he's got a robe throat across his shoulders and it's wove through without seam and look all over that little robe now a little white robe there comes a little red spot it's that blood coming through his back whereby his stripes were healed oh could I deny that he says God keep me mentally right I don't care if it costs my blood what would my old dirty adulterated blood be at the side of his there I see him moving watch as he goes up those spots get bigger bigger and bigger as he moves on I see him fall a colored man come along and help him bear the cross put it up on his shoulder he moves on he can hardly move now look at him as he goes as he's moving on all them little spots run into one big spot his back has bled so much that instead of just spots here and there it's just one big red mess after a while I hear something now going what is it he says it's that old bloody garment beating against his legs what is it animal blood he says finished that's the second Adam there's the Son of God that's the god of Heaven that's not animal blood that's God's blood beating against the legs of the second Adam going to die for the human race God made Adam himself and living on Earth going down to die for the human race the blood of goals bulls and goats could not take away sin but in due season Jesus Christ came and makes the worshiper perfected by the baptism of the Holy Ghost who Jesus Christ died in his place at Calvary we talked about that last time remember as Adam and Eve were leaving the Garden of Eden and they had the Garment of that animal skin that was we believed to be a lamb as they walked out he says it was just what slapping against their leg in the blood running down he says the second Adam comes and it's not the blood of Alan it's the blood of the lamb and he's got another garment and it's covering him soaked in his own blood running down his own legs is what there is a fountain filled with blood all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is done so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living and for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief when thou shall make his soul and offer him for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied we spoke of that last service and sister Maureen said I said who wants to travail and she said I will you know what it means to travail it means to strive to work to bring forth life he says the travail of his soul is what to bring forth life because it was what women travailing in birth and it was Christ travailing what that a birth could happen after he was gone and that new life would come forth and a bride would come out of it he says and by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I devoid divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors after all that pain all that Agony all that suffering now he had to go die brother man puts it this way he says Mary his beloved mother though she stood and seen him stripped down naked before the people beat into a pulp bones in his hands parted by the cruel Roman nails and all these things in disgrace and heard him screaming for Mercy as he died thinking surely that no man of that caliber could ever die such a death but God works all things together for the good he had to bring him that as I said this morning how would you have confidence in your loved ones ever raising from the dead if we only had Enoch who was translated Elijah who went home to heaven in a chariot if we only had them we would be miserable how do you know that because we already were didn't matter that Elijah and Enoch had gone on we were still miserable he says but this man died he died until the son knew he was dead he died until the moon and stars knew he was dead he died till everything in Earth and Heaven knew he was dead that he might die the death of every Mortal that ever lived because he died is because we live he says he died he died every death that we were supposed to die I estimated eight quadrillion if we live pretty good lives he died eight quadrillion deaths on that cross all in a moment can you imagine what that felt like he says there he's screaming for mercy screaming for Mercy my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me he's in a moment he went from Pure holy perfect and sinless to the smut and filth of this Earth in its totality in its sum over entirety of time he went from perfect to the most lost dirty smutty disgusting thing that this world has ever seen in a moment he went from Perfection to Absolute and total judgment and he screamed for Mercy under that separated from the presence of God he didn't die there as a god and die there's a God can't be associated with filth he died as a man God is the blood of God but he died as a man he didn't have the Holy Ghost Inside him when he died because what he says I commend my spirit and thy hands he gives away so we could get it he died as a man with every bit of pain and suffering he took you think how bad it is to be separated from God for a moment you do something wrong and you know you do wrong and you sit there and you just say I don't even want to go to prayer every moment that you've ever had like that for every person that's ever existed and will exist was compounded into One Moment One brief day for Christ and he stayed there and under that burden he lived an entire day it would have killed any of us and then when the last word was fulfilled what did he do he died and he died of a broken heart he died of a broken heart and it's not just because of us I believe he died of a broken heart because he had lost that relationship that had been his guide his his strength his joy for his entire life he was completely separated from the very thing that was life to him he couldn't live without it so he died of a broken heart brother Brown says now that rock was Christ and it was God's judgment the day you eat thereof the day you die he smoke Christ at Calvary and paid that bitter agonizing death no man never could describe what it was and never will there God placed all the Divine judgment upon him and smote him in the side when out of his side come water and blood and spirit for our Redemption he says now people paint his pictures sometimes with a robe around him or something another on the cross that is not so they dispose that man of every fowl and vulgar thing that they could but he had to be there he was the highest and Loyalist of all the world that ever was or will be and then exposed naked on the cross wounded smitten bleeding gobs of mockery spit hanging from his face a mocking crown of thorns out of his head he says but there but there he conquered death hell sin sickness and the grave and paid the price for it for it all you look at his ministry and you say no no he did that before because he healed the sick and he raised the dead and he delivered this one and and many miracles and wonders no no those were battles and what was he doing he was proving who he was but that was not the victory we needed that was not the payment of the debt that was just showing what happens when God comes into a person that's all he was doing he was proving his what he was but when he died at Calvary brother Brown says that's where he paid the price if he lived his entire life and never died the price would never have been paid he says that's where the victory was won that's where true Freedom was bought he says but on that day at Calvary there wasn't a lamb of this Earth but it was the Lamb of God that was dying wallowing in his own blood he was hacked and chopped and beat and spit on and slammed and smacked and everything by the world and the blood was dropped dripping off his locks when Abel's lamb died it died speaking in a language that Abel could not understand it was bleeding but when bleeding but when God's lamb died that day at Calvary he spoke in a language that no one understood of my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me it was God's lamb hacked to pieces and chopped up he was the very lamb that Abel had in mind when he seen the promise seed of the woman he was the lamb that Daniel saw that was hewed out of a mountain without hands he was the wheel in the middle of the wheel for the prophet they all had foresaw all they had foresaw was met on that day that day at Calvary that brought the great thing in that broke the back of Satan listen Satan always had an answer to this point Satan could stand in the presence of God and he could always point at that mountain of sin death behind he could always Point down there and say you know it's there you know it's there you see it you know what they're doing he could point to our failures he could point to our faults he could point to our flaws he could point to our genetics he could point to our family traditions he could point to our religious spirits and say you know they don't deserve anything they ought to be dead right now and for decades and centuries and Millennia God had to listen to it because Satan had something to talk about he had something to point to he could look at our lives and see look at what he's doing right now look at what she's doing you know that they're not allowed to do that and God had to sit there and take it it was under the blood but he knew there was something there but on this day I can just see Satan up there and he's making the acute accusations against the brother against the sisters as he does and I can see him and he's in mid-sentence and saying did you see with Jonathan curly and God says well hold on a second he says no I don't know what you're talking about I can't see anything it was just right there you saw he says I can't see anything Satan he didn't do it and Satan's going to his phone and he's saying let me show you and he's got his iPhone pulled up and he goes there play and he's got a blank screen Sonny's talking to the demon next to him you got that right you got that give me and he plays his phone and there's nothing on it he's like well surely we have audio of what he just said and guess what the tape recorder doesn't work what's happened in that moment the mountain of sin that disappeared Satan's sitting there saying what do I do now he can't see it and I got no proof what does he do he runs down to Hell with Satan he saves Like Jesus Does it's just up in the cloud and he's got a backup of everything we've ever done but it's all back in hell and he goes back to Hell doesn't he he sits down and he's furiously walking at his computer trying to pull up all of the sin debt the proof the ledgers of everything we've ever done the one and a half million kilometers of sins that we have written in the books in the ledgers of hell and all of a sudden he starts to get a cold clammy feeling because nothing's showing up nothing showing up says something's wrong Amazon told me they'd never ever fail me but they'd have a perfect backup every time and it's gone now at that moment there's a knock on the door the brand puts it this way he says that price was paid and the bondage of Satan was broke gotta put back into the hands of man away that he was looking back for he had to weep no more hit when he broke the backbone of Satan there Calvary the backbone of sin and sickness and it brings every Mortal being on the earth back into the presence of God with sins forgiven hallelujah our sins are forgiven no more can Satan block us off from God there's a highway made there's a telephone sitting there there's a line that Glory brings every person in reach of that line if a man is full of sin it connected him in unscentral he can be forgiven of that sin not only that but that sin is paid for he says oh you don't have to say I'm not worthy sure you're not you never could be but what a worthy one took your place you're free you don't have to wander anymore you don't have to be a pleasure-seeking man out here on the earth there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins where Sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain you don't have to be lost there is a Highway and a way and it's called the way of Holiness the unclean don't pass over it for he comes through the fountain first and then he enters the highway he broke the powers of Satan he opened the prison doors of Hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons fearing that when he died what death would be to him on Calvary he opened those cell doors and let every captive Go free you don't have to no longer be torn down by sin you don't have to no longer yield your members to sin to drinking to smoking to gambling to telling lies you can be honest just an upright and Satan can do nothing about it because you've got a hold of a line a Lifeline that's anchored in the rock of of Ages nothing can shake you from it no winds can shake you no nothing not even death itself can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus that's what Calvary meant men that were in bondage were set free men that were once under fear of death can no longer fear death a man who Longs for a city whose Builder and maker God he can step on the highway and set his face towards heaven because he's free Hallelujah he's redeemed he don't need to wander no more for there is a way of knowing whether you're right or not God gives us life our sins are gone that day at Calvary pay the price Satan's sitting there and he's sitting there and that knock comes on the door and like I said he's got that little inkling something isn't quite right something's changed he says but I know I killed him I know he's dead so we should be good and then that knock comes on the door brother Bradham dramatizes it he says oh he come down into the lower pits of hell he went he knocked at the doors of the devil's hell and the Devil comes to the door as we would look to see and there he said well here you are after all I sure thought I had you when I killed the prophets I was sure I had you when I had John's head cut off in prison but now after all you've got here Satan thought he still had an ace I can hear him say it as he said straighten himself up and said Satan I'm the virgin-born son of the Living God my blood's still wet on the cross I paid the price I've conquered and I've come down to take over and strip you of everything you claim you had he reached over to his side and jerked those keys of death and hell off of him kicked them back into the place where he belonged he conquered hell when he rose he had the keys of death and Hell hanging on his side what's the church scared about then he says amen he conquered Satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he's on his Road out he's on his Road out I want you to put that today because he's come and then there's a road that's going out he says remember there's some more faithful that went on too they were in A Place Called Paradise they could not go into the presence of God because they have worship under the shed blood of lambs and goats and so forth he says it never divorced sin it only covered sin and that's it today friend you can't cover your sins and get in it's got to be got rid of and there's only one thing will do it that is in your church that isn't your baptism by the water that's the blood of Jesus Christ that covers sin and divorces it that me the only means of conquering that there is is through the blood of the Lord Jesus that was a rough day to be Satan he's sitting there he's got a sore bottom where Jesus kicked him he doesn't have the keys to his own house or his kingdom and half of it's been emptied and they've gone up in a general Resurrection what a day that was for Satan and ever since he's been trying to tell us it didn't happen that's what he's trying to tell us every single day because what's he doing he's trying to pull up something that's not on the screen anymore and he sits there and he tries to tell you and he tries to tell me that you're not worthy that you've done too much you've sinned away your day of Grace you're not consistent enough you have no gifts come on what does he tell us everything that he remembers that's buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness listen The Ledger is empty he holds it up I'm not going to hold up the Bible because that's not it I'm going to hold up for the Bob's songbook he says I got everything you ever did in here you know what you do say Satan show me because I'm going to read mine and it says I never did it so let's compare ledgers let's compare ledgers and you start pointing him to what this word says you didn't didn't do and he'll go away real quick amen every record completely erased amen he has no ammunition against US unless you let him yeah and when you realize the price is paid he can't hold it over your head once you repent there is nothing to be held against you brother man says oh I'm not excited I know exactly where I'm standing I know exactly what I'm talking about oh if I could only express my feelings if I could only tell this audience what it really means to be sitting under the anointing of this rock Jesus Christ Jesus he already paid your judgment boy your sickness took your sorrow and settled the question before God are you scared to put your trust in him you don't have to be judged you don't have to think yourself worthy you'll never be worthy but Christ was worthy in your stead that paid the price he says not trying to redeem something you can't redeem it because you ain't got the money to but God had the money and he sent Christ and settled the bill and redeemed you from your sickness your Sorrows your worry your sin and your backsliding he sent the money which was Christ Jesus and deposited it on Calgary on golgotha's hill and tonight every one of you is free if you'll just believe it if y'all just believe it he says you're free from anything that Satan tries to lay on top of you don't ever he says ever try and make payments don't ever try and pay for it you can't do it why price has already been paid there's nothing to pay so why are you trying to pay on it you can't do it there's nothing there but Abraham says you're free if you'll just believe it if you'll just believe it amen we're going to preach on freedom here pretty soon on that scripture that he who the son sets free is free indeed amen but the beauty is when you're free like I said you don't have to pretend there's no pretense in a true son and daughter of God you know when you've got it you know when you've got it remember brother Brahm said there's a way to know that you're right with God he says it's when he puts you through the blood and puts you on the road on the Highway of Holiness and you can stay in there and you can continue all the way into that eternal life that he promised amen it's always through the blood of Calvary Church you're debt free tonight you've been debt free and you didn't know it don't let Satan try and put it back on you man let's stand together if we would you know when he we get down we mess up we fail say the wrong thing do the wrong thing sometimes we don't just quite do it perfectly right and we sit there and we'll beat ourselves up sometimes we mess up bad and sometimes we mess up a little but guess what a Son of God a daughter of God you mess up it it hurts hurts your conscience it it shames you it makes you feel like you're maybe not what you ought to be and Satan will build on top of that every single time that is a foundation for Satan to start trying to build up that mountain of sin dead on you you got to say it is paid it is paid and you can't put that on me it doesn't even exist I've repented I'm a son I'm a daughter of God he paid the price for me and you ain't laying that one on me and you throw it right back at him and say listen this one's on you buddy this one's on you you go pay for it because guess what he's going to pay the price in the end isn't he and let's just bow our heads together Lord God Lord how it humbles us Lord to sit and listen to the Lord the beating the whipping the mangling Lord the destruction that you went through in your body Lord to pay a price for all of us Lord and you didn't do it because we were going to pay you back Lord you did it of your own free will and Lord we want to thank you tonight that you have paid for our sins Lord that we can stand before you Justified sinless spotless perfect Lord Justified glorified already heavenly father because you paid a price and you made a way for us to come back to you Heavenly Father Lord may we never forget it Lord may we not get caught up in our own self and our own spirituality in our own Revelation and our own goodness Lord that

of your life and your price that you paid for us we ask Lord Lord if there's any here that's burdened tonight Lord may they know they are free Lord if there's any that Satan's been beating on Lord may you deliver them this evening we pray Lord if there's any Lord that they've been having the Mind Games that comes when the Tormentor is there Lord may you pull them away and point them to your word that says he who the son sets free is free indeed amen Lord we're claiming that each one tonight Lord not only for myself but for my brothers and sisters sitting and standing here we pray it Lord we ask the freedom of your Holy Spirit to move in our lives now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you know the song I want to sing you probably don't pay them full it's been man it's been a long time since we sang it it was the old curlette special if you remember back in the old days I'm in the quaking curlets as we called ourselves but we're gonna sing this song and we're going to worship
