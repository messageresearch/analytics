[46:40] amen true faith we're trusting again the
[46:42] lord will help us to go a little further
[46:44] into the
[46:45] thoughts on faith amen and
[46:48] millions and millions in the world today
[46:50] believe they have faith
[46:51] but it's not the faith that pleases god
[46:54] and there's again many many around the
[46:56] world
[46:56] who own they feel well i've got faith i
[46:59] got faith i believe i believe this i
[47:00] believe that
[47:02] but yet are we believing what god wants
[47:04] us to believe
[47:05] are we believing what god is putting the
[47:07] emphasis on
[47:08] in these last days oh brother what an
[47:12] hour that
[47:12] we're living what an hour that we we
[47:14] need to know what god is looking for
[47:16] amen so that we're going to walk amen
[47:19] according as god would have us to walk
[47:22] by the grace of god we're going to
[47:23] believe what god wants us to believe
[47:25] amen not only that what we need to
[47:27] believe
[47:28] amen we're looking for a change amen
[47:31] we're looking to go from time to
[47:33] eternity
[47:33] okay good what's going to give us that
[47:36] faith
[47:37] because we're going from time to
[47:38] eternity it is a faith
[47:40] that will please god amen like we said
[47:43] there in ephesians
[47:44] we've been we've been resurrected and
[47:45] we've been caught up and raptured
[47:47] spiritually
[47:48] in christ and the word is being revealed
[47:50] there
[47:51] amen praise the lord so brother of you
[47:54] if you've experienced the resurrection
[47:56] you've experienced the rapture
[47:58] spiritually brother hallelujah you know
[48:00] what god wants
[48:01] wants in you you know the faith that god
[48:04] is looking for
[48:04] in you so i trust by grace that we're
[48:07] going to we're going to really really
[48:10] take it serious concerning what god has
[48:12] spoke to us
[48:13] on faith and brother how much how much
[48:17] more serious ought to be
[48:19] considering what jesus said considering
[48:22] considering the last days
[48:24] that when he came when he would come he
[48:26] said will he
[48:27] find faith on the earth what
[48:30] faith is going to be that god that bad
[48:32] lord yes it's going to be that bad
[48:35] amen so again i've emphasized it
[48:38] let me say it again this is even a
[48:40] greater reason
[48:41] for us to make our calling and our
[48:44] election
[48:45] sure by the grace of god amen
[48:48] a confirmation of our faith the faith
[48:51] that god wants us to have
[48:52] the faith that brother of all that god
[48:54] has done and the word he's revealed
[48:56] it's ordained predestinated to give us
[48:58] that that faith
[48:59] amen going beyond the faith in the first
[49:03] age
[49:03] going beyond the faith in in the way on
[49:06] down through luther
[49:07] wesley even the pentecostals amen we're
[49:10] going beyond that
[49:11] amen because brother god did it
[49:14] they believed it they lived it amen so
[49:17] now
[49:18] what has god done what are we believing
[49:20] what are we living
[49:21] amen and what are we living for i tell
[49:24] you like luther and lutheran them they
[49:25] only lived
[49:26] just to they went out what for to to
[49:28] reveal in there in their lives
[49:30] amen in their testimony what
[49:32] justification was
[49:34] amen it was god in simplicity praise the
[49:37] lord
[49:37] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[49:40] ghost the gifts of the spirit
[49:42] amen brother leave it as the prophet
[49:46] said
[49:46] coming out of the seals now he said
[49:48] listen he said leave it the way that it
[49:50] is
[49:51] and he said don't make it bigger than
[49:53] what it is and don't make it smaller
[49:55] than what it is
[49:56] amen so brother all that god has done
[49:58] and what god has revealed what luther
[50:00] didn't
[50:00] didn't make it any bigger amen brother
[50:03] that was that was a simple
[50:05] faith a civil revelation that god gave
[50:07] luther amen
[50:09] oh it it shocked it shocked him and oh
[50:11] my he just kept going going going amen
[50:14] and brother he got to the place where oh
[50:16] he saw what god was he saw
[50:18] what the revelation of god the faith of
[50:20] god amen
[50:22] and of course we know he came out of the
[50:23] catholic church but there was a time
[50:25] when he oh
[50:26] my he he drew a big list oh of of
[50:30] false teachings of the catholic church
[50:32] and this and this and this
[50:33] he was pointing them to god in
[50:34] simplicity in the word amen
[50:37] oh yeah and that's another reason why
[50:39] they they brought them in
[50:41] they put them on trial in the church and
[50:43] oh yeah they were they were going to
[50:44] kill them
[50:45] they threatened to kill him but
[50:47] threatened to take his life and
[50:49] what did luther say amen he just stood
[50:51] there
[50:52] in all that oh
[50:55] luther you've got to you ought to be
[50:56] afraid you ought to get nervous
[50:59] well they said what are you going to do
[51:01] he said we're giving you a choice
[51:03] amen and what luther just stood there
[51:05] and he said here i stand
[51:07] he said i can do no other amen
[51:11] he wasn't going to compromise amen he
[51:13] wasn't going to turn away
[51:15] from what god had revealed to him
[51:16] concerning justification he was going to
[51:18] keep on sharing it amen
[51:20] and again brother praise the lord god
[51:22] has got friends
[51:23] in every age for his elect oh yeah god's
[51:26] got somebody there to protect them
[51:28] someone there to help them
[51:29] amen and father brother got to the place
[51:32] where the military
[51:33] in luther's day the military went over
[51:36] and got luther and took him into the
[51:37] wilderness
[51:38] while four to hide him and they wanted
[51:39] to save his life amen
[51:41] they didn't want nothing they didn't
[51:43] want the the church or anybody to do
[51:44] anything to harm
[51:46] luther no sir they appreciated what he
[51:48] did we appreciate what god reveals
[51:50] with amen so brother and sister the i
[51:53] tell you
[51:53] it's not necessarily man altogether but
[51:55] it's the devil
[51:56] knowing his time is short brother he's
[51:59] going to get come down
[52:00] amen and he's going he's going to fight
[52:03] us
[52:04] he's going to fight what we believe amen
[52:06] oh yes
[52:07] he's going to try but oh yeah by his
[52:09] works he's going to try to get us to
[52:11] oh yeah just just just get it in your
[52:13] head but not in your heart
[52:14] amen and again the problem god did bread
[52:17] they'd bring it
[52:17] out and he said oh yeah you got the you
[52:19] got the mechanics but not the dynamics
[52:22] amen the holy ghost and again and
[52:24] another in another message he said
[52:26] he said you're in the message but the
[52:28] message is not in you
[52:30] and he was talking to the believers in
[52:32] his own church
[52:34] oh yeah he knew that so brother what
[52:36] would he feel today
[52:37] what would god reveal to him today if he
[52:40] was here in this assembly
[52:42] amen that whether or not we have the
[52:44] real genuine holy ghost faith
[52:47] amen or do we have the intellectual
[52:50] knowledge
[52:50] amen of the letter of the word but not
[52:53] the spiritual revelation
[52:55] amen because if it's god if your faith
[52:57] is of god if your faith is from god
[53:00] amen brother if it's true true faith
[53:03] it's in your heart amen not that but
[53:06] it's a faith that controls
[53:07] thoughts words and deeds amen it's a
[53:10] faith that controls your motives and
[53:12] objections in life it controls you
[53:14] oh you see you see it's god in charge by
[53:17] faith by faith by faith
[53:18] you're looking for this and god will
[53:20] reveal this you're looking for this and
[53:21] god
[53:22] does this and you just stay with the
[53:23] lord amen by the grace of god
[53:26] you're not living for yourself you're
[53:28] not living for this church
[53:29] you're not living for william branham
[53:30] you're living for jesus amen
[53:33] praise the lord and no wonder that god
[53:35] took the prophet off the scene he had to
[53:37] amen because they were going to worship
[53:39] him amen
[53:41] not jesus oh yes they were screaming
[53:43] more and more and more
[53:45] amen as again that brother put that note
[53:47] in the prophet's pocket
[53:49] oh yeah when he was moving he was going
[53:50] up toward the pulpit and that brother
[53:52] come over
[53:53] and he and he put this note in his
[53:55] pocket and he ran back and he was he was
[53:57] doing the recording he was recording
[53:59] that service amen
[54:01] oh yes it's the brother that we would be
[54:04] familiar with if i mention his name
[54:06] amen and so brother branham when he got
[54:08] up there
[54:09] on the platform he took the he took the
[54:11] note out and read it
[54:13] amen and he said oh what
[54:17] william branham is my lord that was the
[54:20] note
[54:20] that was the note amen and the prophet
[54:23] when he come to the pulpit
[54:25] brothers he had to highlight it and he
[54:27] had he had to refer to it
[54:28] and he said he said our brother gave me
[54:30] a note he said and he took it out and
[54:32] and he read it
[54:33] and he said william branham is my lord
[54:35] he said listen he said you know what
[54:37] that does that makes me antichrist
[54:39] amen so he said no he said i'm not your
[54:42] lord
[54:42] no he was here he was here to reveal his
[54:45] lord he was there to
[54:46] amen to show him his lord amen in the
[54:48] word by the word
[54:50] and by the signs and wonders he said
[54:51] this is not me he said i can't do this
[54:55] amen he said i've got to get out of the
[54:57] way and again we have seen him on the
[54:59] films
[55:01] and we've heard him say it maybe on on
[55:03] on
[55:04] sermons or the tapes now he said i got
[55:07] to get out of the way
[55:08] so he can take over amen so jesus came
[55:12] in and and i'm sure
[55:13] in one of the films there and that with
[55:15] the deep color to the deep
[55:17] that he was saying the same thing and he
[55:19] was talking and talking and talking
[55:21] amen that's something they didn't
[55:22] understand you know because they felt it
[55:24] would be more emotional
[55:26] and more you know they feel this feel
[55:28] that good scream of this the scream of
[55:30] that
[55:31] no no he said now he said you know what
[55:33] i'm waiting for
[55:34] he said i'm waiting for him to come on
[55:36] the scene amen
[55:38] why he said because he couldn't do it
[55:40] well what they wanted it took it took
[55:42] jesus coming on the scene
[55:44] amen then all of a sudden that pillar of
[55:46] fire came in
[55:47] came into that room and the prophet of
[55:49] god saw it
[55:50] and he said oh praise the lord he said
[55:52] he's here he's there

[1:12:18] i believe
[1:12:22] amen praise the lord amen our
[1:12:25] musicians can take a seat amen
[1:12:29] god bless them you know and to ask you
[1:12:32] to
[1:12:33] keep sister betty in prayer because she
[1:12:34] is still
[1:12:36] suffering with pain and agony when it
[1:12:39] comes to her back and her hips and
[1:12:40] and and her her legs the grace of god
[1:12:44] she's waiting a long time for to see
[1:12:46] a specialist and uh and of course
[1:12:51] it's amazing you know that that we have
[1:12:54] to wait so long for this
[1:12:55] wait so long for that and i guess one of
[1:12:58] the reasons is is because everything is
[1:13:00] free
[1:13:01] and the doctors want to do this they
[1:13:02] take so many in
[1:13:04] whereas one time they wouldn't do that
[1:13:06] so we pray the grace of god to
[1:13:08] help her to get to see the doctor amen
[1:13:10] and praying grace to
[1:13:11] increase her faith amen to believe that
[1:13:15] with his stripes
[1:13:16] she was healed remember healing is past
[1:13:20] tense it's done god help us
[1:13:23] amen and also again to
[1:13:27] it was mentioned by our brother bob i
[1:13:29] believe again to keep remembering our
[1:13:31] brother tom snow in prayer
[1:13:33] and again as i said there was it was a
[1:13:35] few days ago that the doctor's only
[1:13:37] given maybe three hours
[1:13:38] or maybe a week and he's he's long over
[1:13:41] three hours
[1:13:43] and and he's into a second week not a
[1:13:45] third one
[1:13:46] and not the first one rather so the
[1:13:49] grace to our brother tom
[1:13:50] amen and not and even the last time i
[1:13:54] saw him in his home and had prayer with
[1:13:55] him
[1:13:56] oh he was there and he was worshiping
[1:13:59] praise the lord
[1:14:01] amen everything was so real to him so i
[1:14:04] pray grace
[1:14:05] that as he gets closer to eternity it
[1:14:07] become more real
[1:14:08] well it will it will yeah and and
[1:14:11] others are amazed at his faith because
[1:14:14] his son
[1:14:14] ed snow he usually goes up when he's
[1:14:17] there he'll pray for
[1:14:18] pray for our brother tom and uh
[1:14:22] and for the time when when brother ed
[1:14:24] prays brother tom is there
[1:14:25] to raise his arms if he can do it or to
[1:14:28] say praise the lord thank you jesus
[1:14:30] amen oh yeah he's confused when it comes
[1:14:32] to the natural things of life
[1:14:34] but he hasn't forgotten the spiritual
[1:14:36] amen praise the lord god bless you
[1:14:39] and also
[1:14:43] uh and you were praying for brother gord
[1:14:45] snow's daughter again
[1:14:47] the second daughter yeah she she died
[1:14:50] and she was i think she was 52 years old
[1:14:54] and so we pray the grace of god and
[1:14:57] uh to our brother gord as they deal with
[1:14:59] this second daughter
[1:15:01] amen in such a short period of time amen
[1:15:05] and also uh today brother george
[1:15:10] smith called me on the phone and uh
[1:15:15] and so we were discussing the word and
[1:15:17] exactly what he's doing and what he can
[1:15:19] do
[1:15:19] but he still mainly i think he has
[1:15:22] visited
[1:15:23] and he's traveled to maybe central and
[1:15:25] south america
[1:15:26] but he's basically i don't think he can
[1:15:28] go anywhere else
[1:15:29] except in tennessee or in the united
[1:15:32] states he
[1:15:33] he did drive around tennessee to
[1:15:35] different churches
[1:15:36] and uh at the time i spoke with me
[1:15:40] i think it was in his plans to for that
[1:15:42] next day i guess
[1:15:43] that he was going to drive to i think
[1:15:47] south carolina north or south carolina
[1:15:50] and uh so he can do that so we pray the
[1:15:53] grace of god be with our brother
[1:15:55] and uh he also informed me that when it
[1:15:57] comes to
[1:15:58] the trips to israel that uh the trips
[1:16:01] that they've they made
[1:16:02] many many many years him and rebecca
[1:16:05] used to do it and after after rebecca
[1:16:08] went on to be with the lord of course
[1:16:09] brother george still kept going to
[1:16:11] israel
[1:16:12] maybe two or three times a year but it's
[1:16:15] it's now
[1:16:16] he said i feel brother that the trips to
[1:16:18] israel are over
[1:16:19] it's finished and they don't think that
[1:16:22] he'll be going there anymore of course
[1:16:24] our brother george himself is getting
[1:16:26] older and
[1:16:28] and maybe getting moving on to 80 years
[1:16:30] old he's 76 or 77 years old
[1:16:33] so grace of god be with brother george
[1:16:36] but it's in him to keep ministering
[1:16:37] and stay with the word stay with the
[1:16:39] message so
[1:16:41] and he asked me to send greetings to the
[1:16:43] saints here
[1:16:44] he said pass on my greetings he said
[1:16:46] brother and he said also he said keep me
[1:16:48] in prayer
[1:16:49] amen so god bless our brother george
[1:16:52] smith
[1:16:53] so he's living in he's still living in
[1:16:54] tennessee
[1:16:56] of course he goes to a church there i'm
[1:16:57] not sure the name of the pastor now

[1:28:42] said when we get to get in
[1:28:44] into heaven we get into eternity and he
[1:28:46] said unto those glorified bodies he says
[1:28:48] it's going to be
[1:28:49] it's still going to be flesh and blood
[1:28:51] no brother i said it's not

[1:30:56] what he has prophesied that he's going
[1:30:58] to do

[1:32:09] made flesh and you and me
[1:32:11] amen the grace of god amen
[1:32:14] do we truly believe it to the extent
[1:32:17] that it's now
[1:32:18] now christ in us bringing to pass
[1:32:21] what he did and what he's what he's
[1:32:24] doing
[1:32:24] amen what did he do what did he do all
[1:32:27] of this when it comes to luther and
[1:32:28] wesleyan
[1:32:29] and elijah but down here in in the up
[1:32:31] here rather in the last age
[1:32:33] it was the complete revelation of god
[1:32:35] amen
[1:32:36] according to revelation 10 amen the
[1:32:39] mystery of god revealed
[1:32:40] in the old me of the seven seals so
[1:32:42] brother yeah
[1:32:44] that was done but are we
[1:32:47] or is christ in us amen manifesting
[1:32:51] why he did it amen what was what is
[1:32:54] supposed to be the results of the
[1:32:56] opening of the seven seals
[1:32:57] what is the results of the of that
[1:32:59] messenger of malachi 4.
[1:33:01] amen what is the results of god doing
[1:33:04] this god doing that
[1:33:05] amen in william branham's life and man
[1:33:08] like i said
[1:33:09] there was the evangelist back in back in
[1:33:11] those days
[1:33:12] they they just they just couldn't
[1:33:14] recognize william branham's ministry
[1:33:17] amen they recognize oh he does this he
[1:33:20] does this
[1:33:20] when it comes to healing and signs and
[1:33:22] wonders but when it comes to the word
[1:33:24] they they couldn't recognize and there
[1:33:27] was
[1:33:27] there was a link one time on the
[1:33:29] internet and they had a site there
[1:33:30] and they said how do we reconcile they
[1:33:33] said the the
[1:33:34] the the signs and wonders
[1:33:37] amen and the miracles of william brown's
[1:33:39] ministry how do we reconcile that with
[1:33:41] what he teaches
[1:33:43] yeah because oh they they recognized
[1:33:45] this was god
[1:33:46] god and william branham god was doing
[1:33:48] this surely william brennan couldn't do
[1:33:49] it
[1:33:50] it was god in it but jesus had him they
[1:33:52] said this is amazing
[1:33:53] but yet they said consider what he
[1:33:55] taught and the things that he preached
[1:33:58] they said how do we reconcile that and
[1:34:00] say well
[1:34:01] brandon was a man of god and he had
[1:34:03] those kinds of winners it was god in him
[1:34:05] god with him amen using him but he said
[1:34:08] what about the teaching where did that
[1:34:09] come from
[1:34:10] because they didn't believe it and again
[1:34:12] that's why even
[1:34:13] oral roberts when when he he was
[1:34:15] fellowshipping with brother brown and he
[1:34:17] told brother about him brother branham
[1:34:18] you've got to stop
[1:34:19] preaching those things he told him and
[1:34:22] brother brown said no my brother if i
[1:34:23] don't preach it who's going to preach it
[1:34:26] he said the ministry is not preaching
[1:34:28] out there the pastors are not preaching
[1:34:29] it
[1:34:30] so he said so he felt that he had to
[1:34:32] preach it and god wanted to preach and
[1:34:34] he wouldn't stop
[1:34:35] amen and that's why eventually all the
[1:34:38] all the preachers pulled away from them
[1:34:39] the evangelists pulled away from them
[1:34:41] amen that's right
[1:34:43] and they began to crucify him yeah with
[1:34:46] their words
[1:34:47] amen so brother and sister amen but so
[1:34:51] it so is god accomplishing in us
[1:34:53] what he what he always ordained to
[1:34:54] accomplish through the ministry of
[1:34:56] william branham
[1:34:58] god did this through william graham god
[1:34:59] did that true william random but what is
[1:35:01] it accomplishing in us
[1:35:04] amen oh it just brought me out of
[1:35:06] denominations
[1:35:07] and i recognized him as a prophet and
[1:35:09] and he preached this and he preached
[1:35:11] that yeah well that's good
[1:35:12] why did god ordain it why did he preach
[1:35:14] all that
[1:35:16] amen well they they luther preached
[1:35:19] justification
[1:35:20] and there was a generation that was a
[1:35:22] church age that was justified
[1:35:24] and then in lutheran wesley rather a
[1:35:26] church age that was sanctified
[1:35:27] and then the pentecostals there was a
[1:35:29] church age amen
[1:35:31] that received the anointing of the holy
[1:35:33] ghost gives to the spirit amen
[1:35:35] right but still brother brown said
[1:35:39] he said what's wrong with pentecost he
[1:35:40] said they don't recognize the message
[1:35:42] amen they should have amen
[1:35:45] because god ordained it god
[1:35:47] predestinated for to
[1:35:49] to give us faith amen
[1:35:52] and not just a faith for justification
[1:35:55] and so on down to the other ages amen
[1:35:58] but the faith for the resurrection
[1:36:00] and the rapture amen how many of us are
[1:36:03] getting more and more
[1:36:04] into the resurrection more and more into
[1:36:07] the rapture and focusing more and more
[1:36:09] on what god's
[1:36:10] doing through the word that he revealed
[1:36:14] amen and not there just to condemn this
[1:36:16] one and condemn that one condemn this
[1:36:17] one
[1:36:18] and condemn oh yeah oh they believe in
[1:36:20] the trinity
[1:36:21] oh they believe in this they believe in
[1:36:23] that what do we believe
[1:36:26] well what your what the life you live
[1:36:28] proof what you believe
[1:36:30] amen what effect is the message having
[1:36:34] in your everyday living
[1:36:36] amen so that what you do when where and
[1:36:39] how you do it
[1:36:40] it's controlled by the holy ghost amen
[1:36:42] because you want to stay in line with
[1:36:44] the word
[1:36:45] amen and you want to keep walking in the
[1:36:47] word keep walking keep going
[1:36:49] amen but yeah oh yes this doctrine this

[1:37:14] revealed word for this hour
[1:37:16] is ordained to give us faith not to
[1:37:18] focus on the world amen but to focus on

[1:37:28] rapture how many are really living for

[1:38:05] old-fashioned salvation army
[1:38:06] the baptism of the holy ghost yeah and
[1:38:09] the gifts of the spirit
[1:38:11] and i'll tell you this and what and the
[1:38:13] prophet was right
[1:38:14] when he said they that the the
[1:38:16] methodists organized so quickly
[1:38:18] that god had to raise up william booth
[1:38:20] with red hot salvation
[1:38:22] to take them on to the pentecostal
[1:38:24] revival amen
[1:38:26] and i've got writings of their sermons
[1:38:28] and writings of what they were preaching
[1:38:29] and brother
[1:38:30] right near the end of their ministries
[1:38:32] they were preaching oh
[1:38:34] amen we thank god for you know
[1:38:36] justification sanctification
[1:38:38] but we're what we what we need now is
[1:38:41] what peter
[1:38:42] what did on the day of pentecost the
[1:38:45] army was saying that
[1:38:46] oh yeah the founders of the salvation
[1:38:48] army was pointing that
[1:38:49] this is what we need this is what we
[1:38:51] need
[1:38:52] amen and they saw this was happening
[1:38:55] that was happening
[1:38:56] and the church was becoming modern and
[1:38:58] and yeah amen
[1:38:59] and yes yes they noticed that they were
[1:39:01] coming worldly
[1:39:03] and yet they're still professed to be
[1:39:05] church and coming worldly
[1:39:07] to the extent that that our brother
[1:39:09] william booth
[1:39:10] and his wife when they preached they had
[1:39:12] to scream out
[1:39:14] listen they said your experiences are
[1:39:15] going to begin in your closet
[1:39:19] why because they noticed that that the
[1:39:21] brothers and sisters were getting modern
[1:39:22] in in what they were wearing and what
[1:39:24] they were doing and how they were living
[1:39:25] and so on
[1:39:26] amen so they preached it repent
[1:39:29] amen but god took them on to the
[1:39:31] pentecostal revival
[1:39:33] amen and the pentecostal revival went on
[1:39:35] and on and on
[1:39:36] but now where is it where is it
[1:39:40] amen but it's not there now like it used
[1:39:43] to be
[1:39:44] no siree it's not like it used to be
[1:39:46] even when when i was
[1:39:47] as i said raised salvation army and then
[1:39:50] when we moved my my family moved in here
[1:39:53] and we we eventually began to go to go
[1:39:55] to a pentecostal church
[1:39:56] it was on casey street i think or
[1:39:59] cashton avenue
[1:40:01] not far from the the sinclair hospital
[1:40:04] there
[1:40:04] down down the street there the building
[1:40:06] is still there but not a church anymore
[1:40:09] but i did go to that church there amen
[1:40:13] a few times and then i remember i said
[1:40:15] oh
[1:40:17] well they're they're fur they're they're
[1:40:18] gone further into the word than in the
[1:40:20] salvation army
[1:40:21] so lord i'll i'll stay here oh i stayed
[1:40:24] with them
[1:40:25] and when they built the new one and even
[1:40:26] that one is sold now
[1:40:28] they got another one i came out rolled
[1:40:30] and i i was in that that
[1:40:32] other new one there and i just kept
[1:40:35] worshiping the lord praising the lord
[1:40:37] amen
[1:40:37] and like i said in december 1965 the
[1:40:40] pastor
[1:40:41] baptized me but again it was in the name
[1:40:43] of the father son the holy ghost
[1:40:45] but it wasn't until early in 1966 that i
[1:40:49] i got the revelation of the message amen
[1:40:52] well i didn't get the full revelation no
[1:40:54] at that time but it was when i went back
[1:40:57] to gamble
[1:40:58] and fellowship with brother and sister
[1:40:59] burns amen
[1:41:01] and fellowship with the others that were
[1:41:02] there just a few of us in there in their
[1:41:04] room

[1:41:07] to tell you
[1:41:08] and amen we got a prophet amen
[1:41:11] praise the lord hallelujah so brother
[1:41:15] the word began to take effect in my life
[1:41:18] amen to change me and to finally that i
[1:41:22] left pentecost
[1:41:23] amen because i wasn't wanted in
[1:41:25] pentecost they didn't want me there
[1:41:27] and so on because i would testify of
[1:41:29] this testify of that
[1:41:30] didn't want it amen they felt i was just
[1:41:33] leading those
[1:41:34] other pentecostals leaving leaving them
[1:41:36] astray
[1:41:37] and and i did to approach the one the
[1:41:39] one of the
[1:41:40] brothers that i was accused of for doing
[1:41:43] this doing that
[1:41:44] and he said brother it's not you he said
[1:41:47] you haven't done nothing to me
[1:41:48] you've helped me when it comes to the
[1:41:51] revelation of the word

[1:41:55] because he said they professed
[1:41:57] he said to be this to be that but he
[1:41:59] said where's god

[1:46:57] to witness to and they
[1:46:58] they they're saying oh they're dead they
[1:47:00] don't know nothing
[1:47:02] what i said no
[1:47:06] i said physically they're dead i said
[1:47:08] because i said that body was cursed
[1:47:10] dust thou art the dust shall thou return
[1:47:13] but i said he gives us a glorified body
[1:47:15] a new body amen oh they said but the
[1:47:18] bible says the dead know not anything
[1:47:20] i said you need to you need to go and
[1:47:22] get all the scriptures
[1:47:23] i should read what it says after amen
[1:47:27] i said yeah i said if you went on a read
[1:47:29] what what what what they said
[1:47:31] the next few chapters as you know they
[1:47:33] don't know anything about this world
[1:47:36] no no not this world amen but they
[1:47:39] they're
[1:47:40] they're very conscious of where they are
[1:47:42] i said remember
[1:47:43] oh i said remember i said the the rich
[1:47:46] man that lifted up his eyes in hell
[1:47:47] being in torment
[1:47:50] what and he and he's and he and he was
[1:47:52] calling on god go
[1:47:53] get get lazarus to go back and warn his
[1:47:56] brothers his natural family
[1:47:59] amen no no no
[1:48:02] and i said lazarus when he died oh
[1:48:05] he was lifted up his eyes in the bosom
[1:48:07] of abraham and that's when that person
[1:48:08] made a joke out of it
[1:48:10] oh abraham's bosom must be some big
[1:48:14] if all that if all the dating crises are
[1:48:16] gone there but they've been
[1:48:17] i said yes they're there they're sitting

[1:48:27] bosom no it's faith
[1:48:29] amen because abraham believed god
[1:48:33] amen abraham had the faith that please
[1:48:36] god
[1:48:36] amen oh they still wouldn't believe what
[1:48:39] i was saying
[1:48:40] that's because the bible says if this
[1:48:42] tabernacle be destroyed we got one
[1:48:44] already waiting eternal in the heavens

[1:49:07] forward into the revelation into the
[1:49:10] faith that pleases god
[1:49:13] oh the faith that pleases god oh yeah
[1:49:15] it's what brother brown preached
[1:49:17] concerning this concerning that
[1:49:20] no that's that's just
[1:49:23] to prepare you for for what he's going
[1:49:25] to do
[1:49:27] all of that together is going to give us
[1:49:29] a faith
[1:49:31] amen of the invisible union of the
[1:49:33] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:49:34] bride
[1:49:35] amen that we're not living for ourselves
[1:49:38] we're living for jesus

[1:49:43] brother too
[1:49:43] that we'll let go of the not the letter
[1:49:46] of the word
[1:49:46] and we'll get more and more into under
[1:49:48] the control of the revelation of the
[1:49:50] word
[1:49:51] amen and amen and if it does anything
[1:49:54] it's going to bring us into a greater
[1:49:55] and a greater relationship with jesus
[1:49:57] amen a greater and a greater
[1:49:59] relationship with our lord
[1:50:01] more and more intimate amen listen

[1:50:09] yeah he wants love
[1:50:12] amen love is thou mean more than these
[1:50:16] he put that emphasis on peter peter
[1:50:18] peter
[1:50:19] peter loveth thou me more than these
[1:50:21] amen
[1:50:22] do we love him more than we love
[1:50:24] anything else
[1:50:25] amen is the devil putting other things
[1:50:27] in our minds and in our flesh
[1:50:29] in our feelings in our in our intellect
[1:50:32] in our knowledge
[1:50:33] oh yeah he preached
[1:50:36] 1962 wisdom versus faith
[1:50:40] oh we're going to have wisdom in the
[1:50:42] word but what about the
[1:50:44] faith for the rapture we got wisdom for
[1:50:47] this
[1:50:47] we see this doctrine this doctrine this
[1:50:49] teaching that teaching
[1:50:50] yeah what about the rapture brother

[1:50:59] for the bride god help us amen
[1:51:02] lord give us that faith
[1:51:06] add to your faith amen no wonder the
[1:51:09] problem of god preached it

[1:51:14] living tabernacle of the living god's
[1:51:16] dwelling place

[1:51:37] and believeth in me shall never
[1:51:40] die what
[1:51:44] never die no never die
[1:51:48] and this is he was at the at the grave
[1:51:49] of lazarus with martha
[1:51:51] and he was talking to her he said though
[1:51:53] he he said though we're dead yet shall
[1:51:55] he live
[1:51:56] and he that liveth and believeth in me
[1:51:58] shall never die

[1:52:08] amen oh you're not going to die no i'm
[1:52:11] not going to die
[1:52:12] that's like again when when a sister
[1:52:14] died a number of years ago
[1:52:17] and at that time oh god
[1:52:21] god rest our soul for sure amen because
[1:52:24] of her testimony
[1:52:25] and it wasn't the message material
[1:52:29] it wasn't the message revelation that
[1:52:30] got her to come out of pentecost
[1:52:32] no no it's just that it was god working
[1:52:35] in her heart and her soul
[1:52:36] and she used to she used to go down and
[1:52:38] sit and fellowship with sister
[1:52:40] sister burns and they'd had a wonderful
[1:52:42] fellowship
[1:52:43] and like their spirits would blend oh
[1:52:46] yeah
[1:52:47] and she would express to sister barnes
[1:52:49] you know how that she didn't feel
[1:52:51] right when it comes to going to
[1:52:52] pentecost she said i don't
[1:52:54] agree what they're doing and how they're
[1:52:56] doing it and so sister barnes she said i
[1:52:58] know
[1:52:58] i understand she said sister lord bless
[1:53:00] you and eventually
[1:53:02] they've kicked her out yeah they kicked
[1:53:05] her out
[1:53:07] and she was one time she was in her
[1:53:10] house or outs
[1:53:11] out on the steps here somewhere and she
[1:53:12] was looking up
[1:53:14] and she could see at that time where the
[1:53:16] pentecost church was and
[1:53:18] and the parsonage and she could say oh
[1:53:21] or saw the office where the pastor was
[1:53:24] working on his notes oh she said he's
[1:53:27] he's doing this he's doing that
[1:53:28] and she quoted a scripture and
[1:53:32] what he was doing i don't recall it
[1:53:34] right now exactly but he said she's
[1:53:36] doing that
[1:53:36] but it was in the old testament there
[1:53:39] where
[1:53:40] where certain ones were doing a certain
[1:53:41] thing but it was false
[1:53:43] but they they did it they thought as it
[1:53:45] were for god i'm doing this for god
[1:53:47] but she said it's false it's a false
[1:53:49] doctrine a false teaching whatever he's
[1:53:51] doing
[1:53:52] she knew that that's before she ever
[1:53:53] knew about the message
[1:53:55] yeah but then she got kicked out
[1:53:59] she took her stand says no i don't agree
[1:54:01] with it don't do
[1:54:02] you're doing it let god do it that was
[1:54:05] her that was her challenge
[1:54:07] because she felt the man was too in
[1:54:09] control too much
[1:54:10] amen but she wanted god in control she
[1:54:13] oh
[1:54:13] they wanted to do this and especially to
[1:54:15] the young people and they had a lot of
[1:54:17] young people in the church there at the
[1:54:18] time they wanted to do this do this do
[1:54:20] this
[1:54:20] to keep the young people in church and
[1:54:22] she said you need to put them in the
[1:54:23] hands of god and he'll keep them in
[1:54:24] church
[1:54:26] amen no they wanted to do this want to
[1:54:29] do that
[1:54:29] so eventually they kicked her out amen
[1:54:33] amen and then she come down to brother
[1:54:35] and sister barnes oh
[1:54:37] and our spirit blended right in and she
[1:54:39] started to come to their
[1:54:40] cottage meetings more and more and more
[1:54:43] and again
[1:54:44] there was another service that we had a
[1:54:46] cottage meeting and and our sister was
[1:54:48] there
[1:54:49] and at the time we had a brother brother
[1:54:51] manuel
[1:54:52] he came from central newfoundland to
[1:54:53] minister to him in the college meeting
[1:54:56] and he was preaching and preaching and
[1:54:58] oh
[1:55:00] then all of a sudden he he talked about
[1:55:04] being being conscious of death and so on
[1:55:08] he said and he said there are those that
[1:55:10] are afraid he said
[1:55:11] when man says you're going to die you're
[1:55:12] going to die and he said this
[1:55:14] that and he said that's not bad it
[1:55:16] shouldn't be see if you've got
[1:55:18] faith you're not going to die you're
[1:55:19] going to leave and this sister was
[1:55:21] sitting in maybe the front seat there
[1:55:23] a chair and she lit out a scream and she
[1:55:26] said amen brother
[1:55:28] amen you're right why because she had
[1:55:31] she that her doctor told her that she

[1:58:13] knowledge of the
[1:58:14] message oh i know this and i know that
[1:58:16] and he refers it again to that message
[1:58:18] wisdom
[1:58:19] versus faith are you going by the wisdom
[1:58:22] knowledge of the of the written word or
[1:58:24] are you going by faith that is giving

[1:59:00] amen but still even there they're
[1:59:02] sincere

[1:59:05] they're still
[1:59:07] conscious of god they still love the
[1:59:08] lord they still love one another

[1:59:14] saints even though that even though that
[1:59:16] their faith was wasn't much
[1:59:18] but again they were sincere oh yeah and
[1:59:21] they wanted more
[1:59:22] do whatever god wanted to do amen well
[1:59:25] why do why would god allow someone like

[1:59:48] i remember first when i come to the
[1:59:49] message
[1:59:51] there are certain ones that would mock
[1:59:53] me and make fun of me
[1:59:59] because i was i was basically maybe the
[2:00:01] only one
[2:00:03] uh here in st john's because when i was
[2:00:05] baptized
[2:00:06] the brother that baptized me he said now
[2:00:07] i'm going to baptize he said
[2:00:09] he said a brother from saint john's and
[2:00:12] he said i want that brother to come now
[2:00:14] and so on it was referring to me
[2:00:16] although there was maybe
[2:00:17] i don't know how many people that was

[2:05:50] made manifest that they were not
[2:05:52] of us but ye have an unction

[2:06:33] and it says whosoever denied the son the
[2:06:35] same as not the father
[2:06:37] but he that acknowledgeth the son and
[2:06:39] the father

[2:06:43] absolute complete relationship
[2:06:47] with god amen

[2:07:12] and these things have written on to you
[2:07:14] concerning them
[2:07:16] that seduce you but the anointing which
[2:07:19] ye
[2:07:20] have received of him abideth in you and
[2:07:23] you need not that any man teach you
[2:07:25] but as the same anointing teaches you of

[2:07:32] taught
[2:07:32] you ye shall abide in him amen

[2:08:17] no matter what the circumstances don't
[2:08:20] pay no attention to circumstances
[2:08:23] believe the word amen
[2:08:33] and he said wait just a minute and we'll
[2:08:36] go back to the seed again
[2:08:39] he said what was it the devil tried to
[2:08:41] do with wisdom
[2:08:43] make god's word say something that it
[2:08:46] didn't say
[2:08:47] amen that's right he tried to make god's
[2:08:50] word say something he didn't say
[2:08:52] so that's the way it comes today amen

[2:08:59] something that it doesn't say
[2:09:01] well they say well i'll tell you brother
[2:09:03] branham you ain't got the right
[2:09:04] interpretation
[2:09:05] the bible said the prophecy of no
[2:09:07] private interpretation
[2:09:09] and why ain't it a private
[2:09:11] interpretation why
[2:09:13] the word of the lord came to the
[2:09:14] prophets it is interpreted
[2:09:17] by the prophet amen and that's why god
[2:09:20] sent a prophet in the last days
[2:09:22] because in the hour that we needed the
[2:09:24] interpretation of the word it's this
[2:09:25] hour
[2:09:26] amen because there's going to be so much
[2:09:28] confusion
[2:09:29] in these last days religious confusion

[2:09:34] amen
[2:09:37] he said god's thoughts is as eternal as
[2:09:39] god is
[2:09:41] and he said that ain't skim milk my
[2:09:42] brother
[2:09:44] and he said he thought his thoughts is
[2:09:46] what he was
[2:09:47] and that's you too yeah
[2:09:50] your thoughts are going to reveal your
[2:09:52] nature
[2:09:54] yeah and of course your thoughts when
[2:09:56] you when you talk
[2:09:58] it's going to reveal your nature

[2:16:38] that oh my
[2:16:39] the world's contaminated with it but
[2:16:41] faith don't believe it
[2:16:43] faith believes god that can make me
[2:16:47] keep that book in order for me to live
[2:16:49] by

[2:16:56] very poor god
[2:16:58] i believe every word it's the truth what
[2:17:00] does it
[2:17:01] what does this do to believe that it
[2:17:04] gives
[2:17:05] faith a perfect resting place
[2:17:08] amen and brother brown is not talking
[2:17:13] you know like different versions of the

[2:17:51] certain
[2:17:52] religious cult that's what we refer to
[2:17:55] it as cult
[2:17:56] and i'm not sure what it was now and i

[2:18:00] showed me the book and i said oh okay
[2:18:02] okay yeah

[2:18:06] it back with the rest of the books again
[2:18:08] oh yeah see god trusts us
[2:18:12] that we're not going to be led astray no

[2:19:23] amen he said to believe the word
[2:19:27] gives faith a perfect resting place amen
[2:19:31] and he said what does faith do it
[2:19:33] believes

[2:19:36] the way god has preserved it down
[2:19:38] through the ages
[2:19:39] and he said here it is it's the word of
[2:19:41] god for me

[2:20:02] oh my
[2:20:08] he said look at cain and abel both of
[2:20:11] them was sincere

[2:20:16] amen like his mother he took reasoning
[2:20:20] wisdom his own wisdom a beautiful
[2:20:22] sacrifice he had the flowers he had the
[2:20:24] foot of the field
[2:20:27] surely god will receive my sacrifice
[2:20:30] i built a lovely altar i have it so
[2:20:33] pretty
[2:20:33] so decorated just like this this easter

[2:20:41] on some altars the altar wasn't made for
[2:20:44] flowers
[2:20:45] it's for sacrifice and he said you just
[2:20:48] showed the same old spirit
[2:20:50] of cain he said the same old devil from
[2:20:53] eden
[2:20:55] and he said what happened and he said
[2:20:57] you know that the man was sincere
[2:20:59] because it meant life or death to him
[2:21:02] and then people don't think they're
[2:21:04] hypocrites
[2:21:05] they're sincere yeah but sincerely wrong
[2:21:09] and he said that don't do it it's truth

[2:22:04] wisdom
[2:22:05] well this life is just as good as that
[2:22:09] and he said i'll show you where that
[2:22:11] comes from just a minute the lord
[2:22:13] willing
[2:22:14] able by what abel by faith
[2:22:19] came by knowledge
[2:22:22] but able by faith offered god the more
[2:22:25] excellent sacrifice
[2:22:27] by faith in what
[2:22:30] in god amen he had faith in the word
[2:22:35] because he wanted to know why he was out
[2:22:37] of that garden
[2:22:38] amen notice by faith
[2:22:42] abel saw the revelation and brought a
[2:22:45] living running blood
[2:22:46] because life was in the blood life is in
[2:22:49] the stem of the flower
[2:22:50] and it's botany life which has no
[2:22:52] feeling i
[2:22:54] i was in hopes that that would soak in
[2:22:57] amen able by faith staying with the word
[2:23:02] by faith not by wisdom by faith each
[2:23:04] seen
[2:23:06] that it was sex blood the blood cell
[2:23:10] comes from the male

[2:23:14] wasn't apples or peaches or potatoes
[2:23:17] or whatever it was that brought them out
[2:23:19] of the garden of eden
[2:23:20] he said it was sex blood and he offered
[2:23:23] blood
[2:23:24] back by faith he done it not by wisdom
[2:23:28] amen i was a man through wisdom going to
[2:23:31] understand
