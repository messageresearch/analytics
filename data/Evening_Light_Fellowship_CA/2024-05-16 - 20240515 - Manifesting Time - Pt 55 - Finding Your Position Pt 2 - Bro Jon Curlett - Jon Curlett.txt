we're thankful this evening Lord when you you when you were here you said blessed are your eyes for you see and your ears for they hear Lord and it's identified for every Overcomer of The Seven Ages Lord that if they could hear they'd over overcome Lord if they'd understand if they'd accept if they'd take the word as you gave it Lord then it would do the work in their lives and Lord we're testimony again this evening lord of the working power of your spirit by your word and Lord we want our eyes to be open we want our ears to be open Lord we want our hearts to be soft Lord willing to accept Lord to Humble ourselves before your word before your spirit this evening Lord God lord I pray you just Minister Lord another simple service perh perhaps Lord but I pray you change our lives Lord help us to reflect you Lord in a more perfect way in a greater way Lord that lives would be changed Lord by just being around us Lord as they come into your presence Lord and that your word could flow out from us Lord not just words Lord not just ideas Lord but living Testaments Lord each one we pray Lord won't you touch your people again this evening Lord speak to hearts and souls we pray Lord help us Lord help us to Lord be sincere before you Lord keep us humble Lord Lord I don't want a religious spirit Lord I don't want to think I'm okay Lord I want to know I'm okay Lord I want to know that I'm in your will I want to know that I'm in your presence Lord I don't want to presume this evening Lord as I go out those doors tonight I don't want to assume anything Lord but I'm praying that your spirit would Quicken each one of us Lord to our calling to our purpose Lord that Lord where we need to straighten up you'll straighten us up Lord where we need to step up you'll help us to step up Lord where we need to let go you'll help us to let go willingly and in Faith Lord that we could be found walking in your perfect will Lord grant it we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you each one let's turn back to Ephesians 4 Ephesians 4 same as we were last service service and then good to see each one that's here tonight remember brother Kingsley sister Melody I checked in with him earlier this week he says he's had the flu and he's not feeling well and she's not feeling well I know he's been busy with work as well so we pray God's grace to them also brother Josh and sister relle I see aren't here and the different ones and I'm praying God's grace to them each one amen just going straight into the word this evening Ephesians 4:16 this is the scripture we focused on last service Lord willing will finish it this evening and Paul's speaking of Christ says from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening we're continuing on with our series of manifesting time and we're taking a second title a second series service on finding your position in this thought of adoption and finding our foreordained position and I want to take that scripture we open with and go back to the Amplified because it's a little easier I'm getting a bit of echo up here brother Matt if you can adjust that a bit amen Ephesians 4:16 from the Amplified says from him the whole body the church in all of its various parts joined and knitted firmly together by what every joint supplies when each part is working properly causes the body to grow and mature building itself up in love and we spent pretty much the last half of last service on that part that talks about being joined and fitted firmly together by what every joint supplies amen we aren't all the same we don't all provide the same thing we don't all have the same position and if we did then we'd be a freak body and I believe one thing is that the bride is not a freak body amen it is a perfectly formed and fitted body and every bits there that's supposed to be there and there's no extra and there's no there's no ones missing out that are supposed to be there amen and when we look at these things then we ought to be able to Value one another in those differences and and that you do one thing and I do something different and that doesn't make you better and me worse or me better and you worse but it just makes us different and God has made us that way and we appreciate it we accept it and we use each other in those things you know it's one thing to say well I accept you brother I accept you sister but will we use you will we trust you in that role amen that's how when we know when we've really been bonded and joined and knitted together is when we'll allow each other to do those things where we'll step aside and let somebody else do a job job amen and do a part in the body of Christ maybe that we would want to do ourselves but we know Satan is always trying to attack us amen he's always trying to get us out of position and he does it with two ways and we'll cover this a bit more in detail at the end but brother Brandon would talk about and he says first thing he'll do is he'll get us caught up in Pride amen and we see that throughout the scriptures time and time again he makes us think more of ourselves than we ought to or he makes us think more of ourselves in the gift than we ought to if we could put it that way amen and then when he when we get lifted up in Pride automatically what happens is we have to put somebody else down amen and God won't stand for that amen God doesn't we can sit here and we can say this one's more important than that one let me tell you you chop one little piece out of your body and see if it's important one little piece you take it out you take out that one little vein that one little blood vessel that one little organ that one little thing that you think has no effect you take it out and you watch what happens to the body it has an effect amen and when one part's missing the whole body suffers amen so we can't do that we we can't just build ourselves up and me I I ran across a funny quote and it was funny to me and it's a one it's one line brother BR said this he says there's too much wind and thunder and not enough still small voices amen that I I talk about that like that's the me monster me me me me me I I I I I amen that's what you see there all big things everything I do is great everything I do is worthy of Note Everything is we talking about that's not the son of Da that's not the son that's not the daughter of God that's talking that way but then we go to the other side of the coin and that's Satan trying to discourage us and he's trying to get us to think well I'm just little old me what do I have what do I bring to the table and then it's that comparative uh Christianity that we've talked about so many times that we start looking at others that are in similar positions or have similar gifts and and we say well I'm no good compared to them and therefore I'm just not going to do it at all and that's comparative Christianity and God doesn't have any part in that and ought not to have any part of that amen you look in the scriptures and almost every hero almost everyone that was used of God was just like you and I and by that I mean nothing special amen just people walking through life being faithful being humble living a simple overcoming life and then God comes down and he uses them in a special way it's not this some buildup of some big thing where we make ourselves into something by any means but it's just God coming down to vessels that will Sur surrender to him and he uses them and he does great things through them amen you know God chose us God elected us God ordained us what we need to do is start thinking his thoughts about us and see what he sees in US rather than what Satan starts to do amen all we've got to do is take what we've got and use it for his glory that's all he asks us to do all he does is he says be faithful in what you've got and I'll bless it and as soon as we can do that as soon as we can say Lord I don't have much remember that little boy that brought the two loaves in the the and and the this the five fishes that was nothing compared to the need but all he brought was what he had and he says I'll give what I have and God multiplied it God took it and he expanded it and he grew it and he fed 5,000 with what one little lad brought to that little special set of meetings young people don't think for a second you can't change the course of a meeting you can't change the course of a church you can't change the course of a body you bring what you have and you give it to God you bring your little bit of worship you bring your little bit of praise you bring your little lick of fire and you watch what God will do it only takes one to get lit that's all it takes is one person to come in humility somebody to come with a need somebody to come with desperation somebody to come with worship whatever it is they bring that one little thing and it can change the entire course of a service it can change the entire course of your own week or somebody else's even amen if we'll just give those things to God Amen we're individually gifted but we're placed and we're working together we read that quote where brother BR says we've got to we're placed to work together we've got to be able to do those things but I want to reach down into the the last two parts of of Ephesians 4:16 and and after it says we're joined and knitted firmly together by what every joint supplies he says when each part is working properly when each part is working properly that's when we're going to start making some progresses not when we're just in position but when we're working properly in those positions amen it's when we recognize our position and we're working correctly in that position cuz if we're not the body can't function and the body can't grow and if we're in position but not working properly then the body's not going to have any use out of us either you think about it you know I think of brother Nelson guy Jr sitting at home there and and he's had surgery on his knee now he had knees that worked but not worked great and now he's got a replacement in there but what does he have to do now he's got to take it and he's got to train it so that it will work properly because without it working properly he might have a knee but it's no good amen and we might have people in this congregation that are built that are ordained for something but until they're working properly they can't be any use they can't be they've got to know what they are and they've got to be uh set up for this and he says when each part is working properly there's a time element to this it's not that just because you're a knee you automatically work as a knee you got to grow you've got to be fitted in if you're a song leader you've got to be worked into that if you're a worshipper a musician a preacher a teacher a one of the helps whatever it might be we've got to be placed in position and then we've got to be brought to working properly so it means there's a time element to this amen and that's the question is will we come into position and learn how to operate properly will we straighten up will we let go of the things that would hold us back amen we've got to know our position and our role but we've got to know how to function inside of that as well you know I'm called to be a preacher I believe but if I focus on song leading I'll never be a great preacher and by that I mean an effective preacher not a great preacher an effective preacher because what I'm not learning how to to operate properly within the lane that I'm called to be in amen we've got to know and that's the first step where we're where we're supposed to be but the second step is to work properly amen we've got to be prepared for that position we've got to be taught we've got to be tested we've got to be trained amen because it's the preparation of the holy spirit that makes us effective and we know that God has placed us when he puts us in that role you say I don't know if I'm supposed to be where I'm supposed to be wherever you are God has called you to be there work in where you're at right now and if he's got more for you he'll bring you into that but in the in the meantime work and be faithful amen we can't force ourselves to be something we can't force ourselves the scripture says can any man by taking thought grow a cubit can he grow a foot and a half none of us can do it can any of us become anything greater in the kingdom of God by forcing it no we can't do it but we can stay faithful where we're at and God can do a work in our life amen even if we know what is our calling if we if we know what God intends for us if we got a revelation of those things then then we've got to wait on God's timing in God's preparation amen David and Moses are two great examples of men that tried to force and didn't force and the trouble that came out of it and the blessing that came out of it as the case may be because here's the thing Satan is always looking to try and get us to force the issue amen sons of God Daughters of God they know how to wait they know how to seek the will of God they know how to rest even when circumstances see Satan is the master of circumstances and faith is the master of circumstances anden Satan brings up up circumstan and he tries to force our hand he tries to get us into making a decision that we can control and we have to be able to sit there and say Lord what would you have your servant to do and wait on him and don't get pushed don't get forced amen it can wait it can wait we have to wait on God Amen but what is it that makes us work properly you say we're talking about when we can get to the place where every one of us is working properly then we're going to start coming into a rapturing condition then we're going to coming in com into the full power of God in the bride but what is it that makes us work properly we go back to 1 Corinthians 12 and I know we spent a lot of time on this but there's a key message here he says now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are differences of administrations but the same Lord there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all and all it's the same Spirit Lord and God remember he says these three are one amen it's so same thing in all of them he says but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all in other words he says the expression the manifestation of the spirit what is that it's the word in flesh so in other words when the word becomes flesh it's given to every person to bring profit not to themselves to the body he says for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by the Same Spirit are you catching what he's saying amen he says to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of s tongues he says but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severly as he will notice he says all these worketh that one in the selfsame spirit in other words it's the holy spirit that works and operates those gifts amen you are a gift to the body of Christ you are a part in the body of Christ but it's the holy spirit all through there all we see is that same spirit that same spirit that same spirit that same Spirit what makes it operate Church it is the holy spirit that's what makes us work properly amen the Common Thread is the anointing of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives not on US in US amen we're going to get into the difference between those two things a little bit later amen but it has to be the same Spirit working in you as is working in me as is working in you as is working in you each and every one of us has to have that same thing flowing through us it's the common thread of the body of Christ because you can come to this church and say I believe this message and attend faithfully and pay your tithes and do all these things but in the end if you don't have the Holy Spirit you won't fit in here it won't worken we've got Collins and cetes and columbos and coffees here and we fit here not because we get along we fit here because we've all got the holy ghost that is what draws draws us each one together amen and I'm not saying that people that have left don't have the Holy Spirit by no means we are each are called to a sovereign local body I believe that and we have one but if you're going to stay here you got to have the Holy Ghost because that's the only thing that ties us together I mean we may sit here and we may look at each other and say Well we'd be friends if we were out in the world I'm here to tell you we would not be we are so different across this church that's what makes us Strong by the Holy Spirit but that would divide us and we if we were out in the world we think that we would be great friends but we are great friends because we are part of the same body and it's the Holy Ghost that's the great unifying Factor amongst us otherwise I wouldn't have anything to do with brother Paul no I would I would but we have some very different personalities in here let me put it this way we don't even get along with our own family that's not got the Holy Ghost amen now can we be honest not saying we don't love them but we don't have time to spend around them because they we don't see eye to eye there's no unifying Factor blood is thicker than water guess what the Holy Ghost is way thicker than all of that amen but if the you know if your family's got the Holy Ghost then that's a special thing but if they don't have the Holy Ghost guess what we can't really spend that much time around them we don't want to be in their homes we don't want to be spending time with their kids and these different things why because there's no connection we happen to be related but the thing that that makes me get along with you and you get along with me is you got the Holy Ghost and I got the Holy Ghost and that's why we can have brother Dale come all the way from Alberta and he fits right in as if he's always been here why he's got the Holy Ghost amen that's what makes the difference in all of these things amen otherwise what happens is Satan will take the differences and he'll magnify them and we have a church split and we have another church split and we have another church split and we have another church split till we got three people each and five people that ought not to be Ministry that's the way it works Satan magnifies the difference the holy ghost covers it with Grace and love and draws us together on the portion of Christ that's in each and every one of us amen without the Holy Spirit it doesn't matter what your calling is it doesn't matter what your purpose is doesn't matter what your gifts are your intelligence or any of those things because it'll just be you operating the gift and that always leads to destruction because in the end what happens is we start to turn towards self- serving rather than serving others and it becomes selfish rather than edifying and we know what that ends up in every time amen it's just me operating the gift it's just you operating the gift and it doesn't get us anywhere brother Braham says this he says instead of trying to be great we ought to be trying to find out how little we can get see he says then God can use us then and only then if I could put it that way I hope I'm not adding to the word this evening he says notice that it takes the weakest and the rejected and practically every hero God ever had on the front line was that type of person a person that that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient thought he wasn't insufficient he thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that person's just in good shape so God can start using them he says that's right it's when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when God can take a hold of them and do something with them he says but when we're thinking that we are able to do it then God can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves see we can't have a false humility God sees right through that God sees right through that to the heart amen God has to see us in real humility where we know that we can't do it on our own you know how we usually figure that out we try it on our own amen we try it on our own and it doesn't work out it doesn't last the fruit of it is not what we expected and we say Okay that wasn't a good idea Lord maybe you could do it next time and all of a sudden we let go and we let God have his wonderful way and beautiful things come out otherwise we get sucked into what I love to call delusions of Competency and it gets us nowhere it gets us nowhere and God's got to use us but then we've got the other side remember we talked about pride and then discouragement and here's the other side he says and then the other side we get these feelings feelings not realities feelings Satan loves to work on our emotions doesn't he he loves to make us feel things he Lov to make us think things but we've got to know by Faith by the word he says then the other side we get these feelings and we think then that we're insufficient and we don't want to do it but then if we just what's the antidote church then if we just listen to the call of God that's the very thing that God wants us to get into that kind of a shape so he can when we're insufficient ourselves then we are subjects to yield to God's spirit see if I don't think I can do it then it's got to be God that's doing it in the first place he says as long as we think that we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know we can't do it then we yield ourselves to God and he does it he says so then if us if it's us trying to do it we'll fail he says but if we'll just yield ourselves to God then God can't fail amen there's only one thing God cannot do and that's fail he can do anything else but fail he cannot fail so as long as we are trying in ourselves and depending on our own abilities and so forth well we'll do nothing he says but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing then God can use us now catch this he says the important thing one of the important things that you must Master he says now remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members alike he says there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life and that is we have to master the thought of human AB ability he says if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us that's righten that's the greatest battle we've got a fight is to lay ourselves aside to lay ourselves down to lay our abilities our will our thoughts our opinions all of these different things he says and when you do that make a complete surrender we I cannot use one ability he says we've got to make a complete surrender and to come to God you've got to surrender to him both soul body and spirit am mean it's got to be all him or it's none of him amen it's got to be a full surrender everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and me see here's the thing skill is not what makes the difference in The Believer amen skill is not what won David over Goliath Goliath came and he had skill and what did David had David had faith in his calling and a Shepherd sling and guess who went down skill amen Jericho's walls had never been breached and a bunch of immigrants came in with trumpets and loud voices and guess what one the skill of Jericho's Engineers are those loud voices and trumpets it was the loud voices and trumpets amen skill is not what changes Souls it's not what changes lives it's not what wins battles in spiritual kingdoms and these things Pharaoh had all of the skill Pharaoh had all of the army and who beat him an old man with a Shepherd stick it's not skill that's going to make the difference amen look at Paul Paul before Saul when he before he comes Paul he's got all the skill in the world he could quote he knew all the quotes he knew all the scriptures his theology was sound he was well recognized he had everything that was required of a Believer and then he met Christ and he said I forsook it all I counted as dung nothing he had was worth taking in to the New Birth he laid every single bit of it down and God used him once he laid it all down God used him to write the majority of the New Testament and set the church in order for the next 2,000 years to bring her all the way into a resurrection and a Rapture what when he laid it all down and counted it as nothing counted it as dong David was called to be King David had no skill David was just a Shepherd boy but when he was called To Be a King God gave him a king anointing and Samuel came and he poured the oil over him at the age of maybe 13 or 14 but David wasn't in a position he wasn't ready to be king yet but he had an anointing on him and that was key because what the anointing had the effect of preparing him for his role you say when I become a preacher I'll I'll have a preacher's anointing no you'll have a preacher's anointing before you ever step behind a Pulpit because God will use it to draw you into your purpose and his plan amen and here's the thing that anointing did for David it kept him from taking things into his own hands he wouldn't have even started out on the path to kingship without that anointing he was he was happy to just sit there and and and raise and protect the Sheep but God called him sovereignly anointed him with oil and put an anointing on him and all of a sudden David's life changed completely and he didn't have to do a thing it was The Sovereign work of God Amen a true anointing will always make you wait on God David was known for going out and coming in he'd go in and seek the Lord he'd come out he'd do what the Lord told him to do and he always came back with the men he went out with David never lost a battle when he sought the Lord never Joshua never lost a battle when he sought the Lord the key is to follow the anointing not to let your skill take the way amen David would never force himself into the throne he wouldn't kill Saul he wouldn't take matters into his own hands none of it had allowed him to wait on God and let God do the work now notice this he says notice David was called by election he was elected called anointed in place that was I think the first series I did here in Newan land was speaking on this he says he was elected by God called from sheep hurting to be the king anointed and positionally placed he says what does the oil represent in the Bible it's the Holy Spirit and when he poured the oil upon him he baptized him with the Holy Spirit in a symbol form he poured the oil upon him it just went all over him a whole horn full of it not sparingly he says and that's the way God pours the holy ghost on a man not sparingly he says he just baptizes him in it anointing him with the spirit in other words Church the lack is not in the anointing God is not holding back his anointing amen we are holding back the anointing if anybody's holding it back amen our own thoughts or ideas the things we're feeding on Amen the lack is not in God the lack is in what the people will recognize in the working of God in their lives God has poured out his Spirit abundantly amen he wants us to have life and that more abundantly the scripture says amen what's the lack the lack is our recognition it's our revelation of what God's done in our lives amen will we surrender to the holy spirit will we recognize what it is and then will we let it do what it's supposed to do he says notice he right then when that anointing struck him he was positionally placed as king am am men he says you are positionally placed in Christ Jesus as Kings and Priests is that right the moment you receive the Holy Spirit God places you in the Kingdom an heir he says what a beautiful picture there you are there you are he says now let me drop this on the side how many Hears justifi by faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ he says every one of you put your hands up is justified by faith is that right the scripture says those who he is called he's Justified those who he's Justified he's glorified amen he says in the presence of almighty God your name is indelibly wrote with the blood of Jesus Christ glorified in his presence positionally placed on Earth for a purpose to do the will of God he says do you see your position Christian amen we look at David and we say well that's a great man of God that's a great warrior that's a king that's an anointed one he says no this is for each and every one of us our names are written we're elected we're positioned we're placed were anointed he says do you see that you've got a place just like he does it's no different he says oh my those fellows up there couldn't understand it he's talking about when David Goes To Face Goliath he says but David had the anointing oil on him he knew where he was standing he says old Goliath stood out there and he said now look let's reason why there's no need of God's armies being defeated well look at that fellow standing out there with his big boast well we know did it but the days of Miracles was passed he says not for David he was anointed he knew where he was at positionally now we can look at this and brother bam keeps saying as soon as he was anointed he was positionally placed was David in the throne no David's still just a Shepherd boy David's nowhere near the throne he's got 15 years ahead of him at least before he gets the throne and brother Braham is saying yet he's positionally placed why two things God had declared by his prophet Samuel that David was going to be King David had thus saith the Lord David had thus sayith the Lord David had the word spoken over him and then what did God do God confirmed it by putting an anointing on David to be king see here's the thing God gives his word but then he sends his Spirit to anoint it in bodies he anoints it in flesh he anoints it in people and that is our confirmation that's our Earnest that's our down payment is that God gives the word he puts thus sayeth the Lord over a bride and then he sends his holy spirit to make it happen in our lives that's what's going on in this age amen as he's confirmed it to us God confirmed his word to David by his anointing now I know we've covered this before so I won't take much time tonight but it says then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward just a little boy maybe younger than my my oldest boy even 13 or 14 years old they think when this happened but watch what happens on the other side it says but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him catch that now one man is in a king position but he doesn't have a king anointing and the other one has a king anointing but no King position and watch how the things change as they move forward as soon as that Spirit comes on David it has to have left Saul because God can't anoint two men for the same position cuz that would cause conflict amen it can't be that way and as soon as God's spirit's left then what's left church an evil spirit there's only two sides here and what happens after that is Saul is left to his own ends his own skill his own intelligence his own character his own morals all those things because before God made up for Saul's mistakes praise the Lord amen God made up for it because there was anointing on him but when that anointing leaves now now what happens is Saul goes downward and downward and downward because he can't take the pressure he can't take it with to to be lowered in the people's eyes he can't take push back he lacks the patience that's needed and what happens is Saul goes from being a persecutor of the enemies to a persecutor of his own people that's what he turns into Saul turns into what Saul who became Paul later was a persecutor of his own people that's what happens when the anointing leaves him David on the other hand steps right into King kingly acts and and character and position these things what's the key if God anoints you you'll act like a person in that role whether you have the role or not that's what we see with David as soon as David gets this anointing on him what does he do he goes right back and he goes back to his responsibilities he doesn't take it on himself to become a king because he didn't ask for it he didn't ask for it there is nothing about becom becoming king of Israel that has anything to do with David's preferences or desires and he goes right back out there but what do we see is he now has the anointing of a king on him and what is the anointing of a king it's not to be served it's to protect those that are under him and under that anointing he kills a lion he kills a bear right David starts to develop this reputation and we've preached on this before and so I won't Bel it tonight but four verses after this in 1st Samuel 16:18 it says they're talking about David and this is one of Saul's servants now talking about David four verses later I don't know how long that took I don't know what kind of a time periods here but this is what David's new reputation is it says then answer one of the servants and said behold I have seen a son of Jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning and playing a mighty Valiant man a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the Lord is with him this is a young man that's 13 or 14 years old church and he's a man of war he's a courageous man he's a great musician he's a good-looking guy and the Lord is with him what is it that made the difference the anointing you say I'm just a little guy young people going to school going to your jobs I'm just little old me this is what the anointing can do it'll set you apart from everybody that's around you that doesn't have it it'll lift you up because you're different not because you desire to be different not because you want an name for yourself but it sets you apart that's what the church means is those that are called out and it what is it that calls us out it's the word and then the anointing comes and confirms it and it sets a difference between us and everybody else amen if it did it for David it'll do it for you amen it he only had it on him he had an anointing on him we have an anointing in US amen we the holy spirit is resident in our lives amen and so we know we talked about David David's acting like a king years before he ever becomes king you know how you know somebody's called to a role they're already doing it they're just not usurping Authority in when they're doing it that's it you'll see people that are are like that they're exhibiting the character the nature of the role that they're called to amen and what are they doing it's the anointing that's on them that's drawing them into that role and it's not by their desire or by anything that they want but it's just the pole of God in their life that's drawing them to where they're supposed to be look at our song leaders what's the purpose of a song leader to lead the people into worship to prepare them for the going forth of the word that's the role of a song leader you know how I know who's going to be her next song leader they're already song leading amen we're going to name some names tonight do you notice brother Bob in song service if he's not up here is he all sitting there all quiet barely get him to clap his hands no he's worshiping as much right there as he does right here amen there is no difference between his actions here and his actions right there why because the anointing of a song leader is on him and whether he's there or whether he's here he's going to lead in worship he's going to have his hands up he's going to be involved in the service because there's an anointing on him to do it whether or not he's behind this Pulpit if brother Josh was sitting back there in song service and wouldn't open his mouth he would never stand behind this Pulpit as a song leader because he's got to be able to worship there before he gets the role before he ever gets it here that's the way it works amen if you can't pull your weight in the Pew you can't you can't step behind here you can't step behind there you can't be anywhere because the anointing will make you do it whether or not you've got the role you can't help it you can't help it because if you're a knee and the anointing of a knee is on you you're going to do what knees do there's nothing can stop but it just comes out of you amen that's why brother Brandon we read that quote where that young man came to him and said I'm called to preach he said well preach what are you waiting for if there's an anointing on you to preach you'll preach no matter what I me you think of preaching itself before I ever got behind a Pulpit you know what I had to learn to do help somebody preach amen I can't sit there in that Pew and sit there like a bump on a log while a Minister's up here preaching and then say well when I get up there they better be loud with me no I need to be what the preacher needs before I can be a preacher I've got to serve I've got to pull on the word I've got to pull on that gift to what create an atmosphere so that the preaching can happen amen I can't do that I can't expect people to react to me and me not react to somebody else here's the thing if you're a real preacher when the word comes forth you can't stop yourself from getting involved Hallelujah listen I don't care who's preaching I don't care who is preaching I don't care who is preaching when they open this book and if you've got the anointing of a preacher on you I don't care who is up there it will spark something in your soul absolutely listen I've been sitting here when brother Gerald's preaching since I moved here and he will preach on something and I will have three pages of notes that have nothing to do with what he's preaching why because the same anointing that's on him is on me and when the word Goes Forth it Sparks something in my soul and it takes off running sometimes I'm with them and sometimes I'm gone in another Direction but the thing is I've got to feed on it before I can give it and when another man's up there I can't help but feed on it I can't help but pull on it because the anointing that's on me to give it has to be the same anointing that's got to feed on it amen I've got to be able to serve a minister before I can be a minister amen I've got to be a part of that the words quickened while we hear these things amen we got to help each other in these things that's why I look at a at the gifts in the body and I say if they're not doing it now then they don't need to be up here amen why because the anointing has to express itself one way or the other no matter what you look at deacons my wife and I were talking about this and I don't say this to raise myself up but I Deacon for a lot of years and even as a young man they were wanting me to be a deacon very early on because they saw something there that looked like a deacon I wasn't ready to be a deacon but they saw something there so like in Texas they have what they call Junior deacons and what do they do first they watch the doors they take people in to to set up them in the in their seats and whatnot and during special meetings they help control the crowds and these things just minor roles they don't have any real Spiritual Authority but they're there to just help and then from there then they can become a senior Deacon somebody that has the that would be voted on in those roles and these different things and so what is it they saw something there that they said that's a deacon I wasn't ready for it yet but they could see something was there why because of how I live my life here's the thing you'll already be living it before you ever get voted into to do it church that's a simple fact that's a simple fact listen if our deacons don't have their houses in order they're never going to be a deacon cuz they're being a deacon already in their own home amen they'll have the character they'll have the nature that's required to be in that role first why what's it it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit bringing us into our role and as we surrender as we yield as we humble ourselves then what comes out of it is the very nature of whatever we're supposed to be in that body it's the anointing that makes the difference that's what I keep saying amen just to finish this quote on David he says he said he knew where he was standing he says hallelujah there you are he knew where he was standing he was a man of Faith he believed God God was in him he knew he was anointed and then he says and you know the same thing church do you know it this evening do you know it do you know that you're no different than David that God is in you and that you're anointed that's what we're talking about this evening amen what a thought that God is in you and God is in me that's what the Holy Ghost is is Christ in me the hope of glory it is the residence of Jesus Christ inside of my body and yours as well amen he says you're Christians and if God hadn't elected you to be a Christian you would not be a Christian it's God choice not yours no man seeks God no man seeks God at any time you haven't sought God but God has sought you it wasn't you calling for God it was God calling for you and then when God called you it showed he elected you you accepted the call it was justification then you gave your heart to Christ and were filled with the Holy Spirit he says and now and now you're positionally placed in the body of Christ he says now if it made you quit your old mean habits and act like a Christian ought to if it'll do that for you it'll heal your body because it's a promise what we've got battles in this body too amen and that spirit is not just to overcome Goliath out there it's here to overcome Goliath right here as well what a shame I was listening to Benny Hinn's uh YouTube suggestion to me and I was like okay it's on this cessationism versus continu ISM does the Holy Spirit till act like it used to act or is it different now and of course almost every Church except for the Pentecostals believes that it doesn't do the things it used to do anymore but I thought what a shame what a shame and there was somebody said you can't deliver yourself and I don't believe I can deliver myself from anything but I've got the Holy Ghost inside of me that can deliver anything I need to be delivered from amen and what a shame that everything is put out and there's no power left in the gospel except this little wishy-washy whatever within science within the realm of no no no no there's a greater God in us than that amen amen he's not dead he's still alive in every one of us amen notice that anointing didn't put David on the throne immediately that anointing prepared him for the throne it got David in working order before he ever put him on the throne built him up tested him corrected him put him in position to act like a king without the consequences of a king to see what his decisions would look like and most of the time David passed but you know what sometimes David failed and you know what that anointing did it caused him to repent every single time the anointing caused David to repent remember Saul comes in to use the bathroom in the cave and they say to David he's he's alone he's vulnerable kill him and David creeps up and he cuts just a part of the skirt off of his of his clothing just a little bit and then he goes out and scripture says I believe that David's heart smoted him his conscience bothered him because he didn't even touch Saul he touched Saul's robe and that anointing struck him and he had to come out and confess his wrong possibly to the detriment of his life remember we said this in a couple Services ago sometimes the way we handle our wrongs is a greater proof of our anointing than the way we live day to day amen cuz the anointing will always humble you to the word every single time every single time the Zeal of this age this leoan age is to repent amen and if you got the Holy Ghost you will repent you will repent you will repent and you will make it right we talked about nabal David nearly killed nabal and his servants over some rude comments and dismissing David's help and it was the grace of God that Abigail Abel's wife came and what did she do she reminded David of who he was this is above you David this is below you you're higher than what you're acting because what happened was David took that anointing and he put it aside and he stood up on his own rights he stood up on his own morals he stood up on his own feelings and he said this guy is worthy of death and what was it God sent a woman to hold him back to preserve his kingdom David needed to pass that test test and he failed the test but God kept him from going through it but then we see many years later what would happen because what happened with nabal was that David acted like Saul that's what Saul would do Saul would preserve his face his reputation and David started acting like Saul what did he do he pushed that spirit away from him and he went in his own righteous anger and he went to act on it and he started acting just like Saul is that shows Church without that Holy Ghost we'll act just like every single person out there every single time every single time what get caught up in our own way of things our own rights our own works and he forgot that a king is about serving not about killing amen eventually God put David on the throne we know that and how do we know it David was working properly David was in his position he held to being a true Godly King and we see David many years later and he's fleeing Jerusalem because absam has taken the throne by force and when he's leaving this man called Shem comes out and he starts cursing at David and he starts throwing rocks at him this is basically the same as nabal but now it's personal now it's direct now David if he hadn't been tuned up by God if he hadn't been working properly he'd have gone over and killed that man himself what would we do if somebody was cursing at us and throwing rocks at us and we've got a men a bunch of men around us with swords and Spears you know we we wouldn't have even said a word we just pointed in our flesh and those men wouldn't need a command they'd know exactly because they'd be feeling the very things that we're feeling and they' want to act on them but that's what the anointings to do is bring those emotions under control watch this okay so Shem is out there and he's throwing rocks and he's calling David a dog and all these different things then said abashi the son of Zarah un the king why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king let me go over I pray thee and take off his head you know what sometimes people want to do a preacher's dirty work for him I've seen it preacher don't get your hands dirty we'll take care of this no no no let it be he says and the King said what have I to do with you you sons of Zariah abashi was joab's brother remember these are bloodthirsty men joab's the one that killed Abner right David didn't want to kill Abner David didn't want to ever take anything by force from his own people these sons of Zariah were constantly a plague they were a thorn in David's side they were Mighty Warriors tremendous men in battle but they had no real moral character he says so let him curse because the Lord ha said unto him curse David David says God told him to do it who then shall say wherefore hast thou done this he says who are we to say why are you doing it and David said to abashi and to all his servants behold my son which came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the Lord had bidden him he's a benjamite same as Saul right he's got old family wounds stirred up there now David's prospering and he was bitter that whole time now David's being taken out of out his King and he's going out there and he's gloating over it he says let him alone and let him curse for the Lord hath bidden him he says it may be that the Lord will look on mine Affliction and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day DAV says we'll leave this in the Lord's hands he may turn this into good for me but regardless we're going to leave him alone he says and as David and his when men went by the way shemay went along on the hillside over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast us he didn't let him go you've got to have a real problem to chase after a king that's got some angry warriors with him but this guy followed him the whole way out and constantly berated him through rocks at him through dust at him cursed at him and David didn't lift finger you know why David wasn't worried Church what put David on the throne the anointing when David's walking out of Jerusalem where's the anointing has it left him no the anointing is still with him because here's the thing if the anointing is not there David doesn't want the kingdom that's the simple truth you and you'll see that you know we've got people that have you know we've got brother Gerald that resigned last year and these different things and what is it it's the spirit of God moving back and it's okay because if it we're not anointed to do it why would we do it what's the point and David but David knows the anointing is still with me so I'm still in God's hands Saul knew when the anointing left him David would know when the anointing left him David knew what it meant to be in the presence of God David knew what it meant to be out of the will of God David's not feeling any of those things right here he says God's in it we're just going to go our way that's the character of the anointing in a person's life amen why David didn't take the throne God gave it to him so he said God gives God can take away God plac me in it God can pull me out it's all up to God this is not by my own choosing by any means what made David a Godly King and Saul not they both had the exact same anointing notice it left Saul and it went to David the exact same anointing what made the difference David was surrendered to it Saul just used it that's it Saul used it Saul used it for his benefit and all he did was built himself up in his own eyes and in the eyes of the people and David just surrendered to it David ran from it he ran from conflict he ran from trying to take it he ran from anybody that tried to influence him he wanted nothing to do it David just wanted to serve and he served as a captain he went in and out he went in and out and you know he had to go out and kill a bunch of Philistines to get Saul's daughter that was rightfully owed to him all these different things and he just stepped up to every Challenge and he beat it and he beat it and he beat it why he was anointed to do it but there's nothing in him that was crying out for these things he was just driven to do it by the anointing on him David was willing to be trained he was willing to wait that was the biggest thing with David he was willing to wait David was willing to wait to perform the work of God and Saul just wanted to get on with it as soon as it looked like he was going to lose the people then he crumbled and he went against what God had said and then he did it twice and after that God said I can't work with you you're too focused on yourself and not focused enough on what I want you to do David's greatest desire what did David say in the Psalms one thing have I desired that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever all David wanted was to be in God's presence that's the only thing that mattered he's walking out of Jerusalem and he's left his his kingdom and his throne behind but he still got God and that's all he cared about he still got God we see what Moses did you know and he he's perhaps the greatest difference we see in the scriptures of an anointing because Moses knew he was a deliverer he knew his position ahead of time had' been prophesied had been told to him he'd been raised as a deliverer but without a commission and without an anointing brother says all he ended up with was one dead Egyptian but as soon as he goes out into that desert becomes a nothing develops a stutter says I can't do it now God meets him and puts an anointing on him and that makes all the difference he goes down brother Bram says he's an 80-year-old man with his big long Gray beard flowing behind him and he says I'm going to deliver the children of Israel a onean army that's the difference the anointing makes amen we've all got to go through that honing remember we talked about that last service there's a honing there's a placing but there's a honing that makes us fit just perfectly into the body for some of us it takes a little bit of time for some of us it takes a long time for Moses it took 40 Years of honing before God could use him brother Bram says this he says God has got a purpose of you being here God has a promise of you put your name there tonight see if you can only be get to that place how much trouble you save God and yourself too we look around don't we listen some of us fought Things Early in our life I look at myself I mean I fought God for seven years feeling called to to give my life to him what a waste of seven years what a waste he says just give up just let it go just give in to God he says how much trouble you save yourself and God now listen God God's not seeing things as trouble the way we do but it's a mess it's a mess and nobody likes a mess he says Moses born and then afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed he says and notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception with all the the faith that he was born to deliver this people you say I've got all faith and I know my purpose that wasn't enough for Moses he says and yet it never came to life until that light from the burning light burning bush flashed across it until he saw not something he read about but something he seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it he says oh how that did bring things to life now that's one thing I will say is that when I gave my heart to the Lord he spoke to me and I spoke back it's one thing to be under conviction it's another thing to hear your name called amen and when I gave my life that service with brother Barry and brother Donnie Reagan I heard my name called loud and clear it was my name it was not a general call it was Jonathan klet I'm calling you tonight under the Discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen that's what it takes for each and every one of us is a personal experience that's what the new birth is brother Brown says it's a personal experience of Jesus Christ to you it's real it's personal it's direct amen what is this intellectual conception we can read this all day long and don't stop reading it we can have faith but we've got to be anointed we've got to be anointed to make the difference what's the anointing the anointing is the Dynamics of God's Will and purpose that's what his word is his will and purpose amen the anointing is the Dynamics of God Amen it's the energy it's the motive it's the power it's the objective it's the purpose it's the will it's the life it's the love everything that's needed that's what's being pushed into Sons and Daughters of God Amen what is it it's Perfection flowing through us not performance it's Perfection what is perfection church for the believer to hit the mark That's What Perfection is see performance is eloquent words a perfectly delivered sermon a a a a song Some with perfect pitch no crying in it amen that's performance but Perfection is to hit the mark what God wants you to do in his time in his season his way by his leading that's what's flowing through us is perfection not performance amen the world has performance nailed they can perform like you would not believe remember I've talked about you know you even the song I shared with some of the the the the song leaders and the musicians to learn that we're going to be learning and you look at the voices and the sound systems what sound systems brother Matt what camera work what mixing what blending they have a full Orchestra there they've got performance nailed and you know what's written over the back of the church ikabod the glory of the Lord has departed amazing performance no Perfection it doesn't hit the mark amen it's the anointing that makes the difference it's the anointing that hits the mark what is a blessing Church a blessing is God is in it that's it when God is in it when it's God in us when the god when God is on our side that's what a blessing is that's what we're looking to be amen the anointing is the only thing that can take a person and make them a blessing it's the anointing because it's God in us amen the anointing is what makes us work properly we say well how can I do it can I do it brother John you're preaching some pretty heady stuff I'm just a a housewife sitting at home I just grade papers all day and I just make food and clean houses and wipe babies bottoms and try and be ready for my husband to come home how am I going to do this Brothers working 8 10 12 maybe 4 hours a day how am I going to do it where am I going to get this time to do this how am I going to come to a higher level the anointing because the anointing is here the word has been spoken and the anointing goes out to bring the word to pass you're a child of God the anointing in you will make you a child of God whether you want to or not it'll bring the word to fruition amen how are we going to do it we'll do it because God said so and his word is backed up by his holy spirit to bring it to pass brother Brown says this he says the two spirits one of them God's holy spirit the other one the devil's Spirit working in deception the people of the world of the Earth are now making their choice the holy spirit's here calling out a bride for Christ he's doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her for this age showing that it is Christ now catch this how are we going to do it Church what's this working properly going to look like how are we going to get into position how are we going to get together how is this body going to do what it's supposed to do catch this he says if the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move he says if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eye is to see in this age the eye will see what's going to make it happen he says see the spirit of God as it's grown into the full stature of God is the age that we're now living in can I say it this way the spirit of God as it's what he's talking about the bride of Christ as the bride of Christ is grown into the full stature of God is the age that we're now living in he says the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the Holy Spirit is doing this so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos it is a mess out there the religious world I I've shared some of the things I've seen and I it's certainly open my eyes to the the one the fanaticism that's out there but two the absolute lack of biblical truth just the Simplicity of the full word is completely lacking out there you don't you don't have to go look at the world you just look at Christianity Today and you see the chaos that's there much less what the rest of the world has he says but the holy spirit's here so that we'll be called out of all of that catch this Moses said it's not just me going we're all going oh well what about the brothers have this because they don't get fooled as easily as us sisters and they get more time to spend in the word and they get to talk to the preachers and the way no no no no no we're all going if the eye is going to see it's going to see if the foot's got to move it's going to move if the hand's going to move it's going to move in this age if God has determined it's going to be it's going to be amen he says we all got something to do we've all got to be anointed amen we've all got to be anointed why because we're all going and we're all a part of the body and I can't leave until you're in and you can't leave until I'm in and working properly by the anointing we said what is a blessing a blessing is God in something what's a curse a curse is the absence of God you look at the the Israelites okay God would give them blessings and curses and he says I'll bless you if you follow my word and I'll curse you if you don't what was the difference between a blessing in a curse never the situation the situations were always the same Israel was always surrounded by armies they were surrounded by people that hated them people that wanted to land back people that wanted to kill them but the blessing was that God was with them the curse was when God removed his hand of protection because he wasn't there what am I getting at we're talking about the anointing we're talking about our places our positions our gifts our callings take our gifts and our callings and let God have them what do we have a blessing remove God from the equation and what is it a curse it can be a Godly gift it can be a Godly calling but if it's not anointed who's in control this guy and guess what this guy is always self-serving by nature and so it always leads to me being served rather than me serving amen by your fruits you know it amen and if I sow it of myself then I'm going to reap what I slded which is just Humanity Fallen condition failure amen one of the greatest deceptions in Christianity is a real gift operated by a man or a woman because it's a real gift it's there but what is it there's an intention in the heart that's not fully surrendered to the Holy Ghost and it can be a real gift and that person what do they eventually produce is they produce denomination they produce self they produce kingdoms they produce influence and all of these different things and it just leads them off into a ditch and they drag a bunch of people else with them amen the only way you know what's right and wrong is if it stays with the word that is always the test of every person of every gift of every Ministry whatever it is it stays with the word anybody here can say they've always stayed with the word a 100% well what does that mean brother John we can't be anointed if we made mistakes no the anointing will always restore you back to the word it'll bring you to repentance it'll humble you it'll correct you and it'll bring you back to the word Perfection is not what we're looking at here it's what's in our heart to do it's what's in our heart to do and the thing is we'll come back to that word every time the anointing caused David to repent the anointing on us causes us to repent when we get out of line when we get caught up in ourselves amen otherwise what happens is the gift continues in error and the fruits come out and what does it prove it proves that it was swn in error it was swn in the flesh Paul said this in Galatians he says be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man sth that shall he also reap for he that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption how do you swow to your flesh act in the flesh Act without the anointing amen with the anointing that's god without the anointing it's flesh then we act in the flesh we Act of our own accord we Act of our own will our purpose benefit self- serving whatever it is that's always a curse amen so if we sow to the flesh we'll reap corruption but he that sth to the Spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting so if we act by the spirit if we're anointed by the spirit then what comes out is eternal it's Eternal amen and we've seen that in our lives and here's the difficulty is always that we've got to see so much time so many times with spirit harvests and me we look at how we raise our children we look at how much we come to church we look at tithing we look at all these different things and it's always the long game with God God is not this person that just does this all the time that's Satan's kingdom Flash and quickness God is just nice and consistent all the way through and then in a moment he'll make a change but really he's been building up to it all along amen so what we see that it'll be worth it all someday but Satan's saying let's make it worthwhile today that immediacy of response to what we do that's when we start sewing to the flesh but scripture says God's not mocked God won't be made a fool of whatever you sow is what you'll reap and if you sow to the flesh you'll reap of the flesh but if you swow to the spirit you'll reap of the spirit amen why because when you swow to the spirit it's him that's planting it's not you and that means you get his Harvest not your Harvest amen Paul would say this in the in the in the previous chapter in Galatians 5 he says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts he says if we live in the spirit he other words he says if you're alive if you're strong by the spirit if the thing that keeps you going as a spirit he says if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit that word walk means let us order our days order our actions order our words let our day be ordered by it if we say we're living by the spirit then let's live by the spirit amen if our I I if our life of us is the spirit then let's let the life that's that comes out of it be the spirit also he says and let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another and envying one another there's only one thing we're supposed to provoke each other too and that's good works amen that's the only thing we're supposed to provoke each other too not Desir us of vain Glory not desirous of people to give us attention recognition influence money whatever it might be no no no we're not seeking that we're seeking to edify always to edify always to serve brother BR says this he says so you see what we are we must remember that we are only what we are by the grace of God how can I be desirous of vain glory for something that has nothing to do with me I know what I am without him I didn't much like it amen how can I be desirous of vain Glory when it's his work that's made me what I am today amen and if there's anything bad it's because I've held back not cuz he he's held back why would I be desirous to to gain what he's what he's obviously done the work for gain the any recognition for it he says we must remember that we are only what we are by the grace of God and none of us can brag about it we can only bow in adoration and humility before God and give praise to him for his goodness amen as we close he says if we live in the spirit let us walk in the spirit if we sow to the spirit we'll have the spirit life Everlasting what's that Harvest that we re reap when it's all said and done when we're in our place when we're joined and knitted together when we're working properly Paul says that it causes the body to grow and mature building itself up in Love no there it says it causes it we talked about if you're anointed you can't help it well here's the thing if we're all anointed and we're all joined and we're all in our place and we're all working effectively and properly it causes the the body to grow and mature it can't help it it can't help it that's just the effect of a body that's healthy is it grows and it matures it gets better it gets stronger and what's happening is God's trying to get us to the place where we're all together that that head can come down and that'll be the final manifestation of the power of God that's the great ending that's that's the sudden bang at the end of the show you know when when we go to the fireworks and that they have all these things going off but at the end they have the grand finale don't they and that's what we're all waiting for is when they just give us three solid minutes of oh wow that's what's going to happen at the end is the whole body is knitted together and then Christ comes down and there's that quick short work to show this is she and then we're gone what does it take knowing your place being anointed and staying in it in love serving the body of Christ it's very simple so simple but can we do it what's full maturity it's Christ the word expressed in you and I that's it that's what full maturity is Christ the word expressed in the whole body I do my little bit you do your little bit you do your little bit you do your little bit and what is it it's now a whole revelation of Christ being shown once again to this world before he takes the bride off of this planet that's where the greater power comes in when you're in your place and I'm in my place he says every little gift that you have have don't use it to try and make it some great something for ourselves let's make it for the kingdom of God to work with everyone to try to uplift the cause of Jesus Christ for his coming is soon how soon is it my wife and I were talking about retirement plans and life insurance and all these different things you know I'm 44 and it's scary I mean in the not too distant future I'll be the Big 5 it doesn't seem you know but you're looking and you're saying goodness I'll be 61 before Jen or before Samuel is when he turns 20 like wow I'm going to be old what are we going to be doing in these different things and through it all at the end I just said even so come Lord Jesus like please get us out of here amen I don't want to be like brother Bob and brother Mark amen no but but we sit here and we make our plans you know brother Aron McGary preached to preached a a series over in Cloverdale on on on farmers in the Rapture brother Bram says if I knew he was coming tomorrow I'd still plant my potatoes I'd still do this we still got to make our plans but I'm sitting here and I'm saying what's it going to take to get us out get into position get into position and put everything you've got into staying in your position and let the spirit flow through you just in Simplicity just in Simplicity no big eyes no little 's no no Grand anything just be ready be willing be yielded and then God does the rest Amen brother bam says this as we close the musicians can come he says if you're ready to be led by the Holy Spirit mind him obey him do what you can for him see we look at it as such a big thing sons of God are led by the spirit of God what I have found and this is just me you you read this every day and serving him becomes quite simple it becomes very simple and you only have to look one day at a time that's the beauty of it you just sit there and say Lord what's coming my way today would you be in it that's all you're inviting him in you're saying Lord anoint me for whatever comes my way today he says when you see a place that you could be used let God use you in that listen if the door is open it's probably for you you're the only one standing there God doesn't open a door so that unbelievers walk through he opens a door so Believers can walk through it when you see a place where you could be used let God use you in that do you believe that he says if God LED you out here he brought you out for a purpose that was for something he could give to you he says now we've got the message in our hearts let's do something about it he says let's ask God tonight in Christ's name to fill our hearts a new and send us away from here with with a new vision with a new determination to being led by the Holy Ghost cased in and a wall on the outside separating us from the things of the world to be new creatures in Christ Jesus amen God bless you let's Stand Together amen I like that a new vision a new determination to be led by the Holy Ghost amen is that your desire this evening Lord I want to be led by the Holy Spirit listen you can't be led by it if you don't have it and amen we've got to seek and say Lord fill me fill me a new amen there's one there there's one baptism but there's many refilling if we could put it that way me sometimes we get dry sometimes we get crusty sometimes we get bitter sometimes we get tired anybody tired tonight we get tired you know what we need a refilling we need a refreshing because that's what a refilling is is a refreshing we haven't lost our Salvation we've lost the joy of our Salvation we haven't lost a God to worship we've just lost the worship that he deserves sometimes and say Lord fill me a new use me fill me overflow me and as the do open help me to walk through and just be what you want me to be you don't have to think about some what am I going to say what am I going to do just be you that's why God Made You just be you we're not here to break down the word and do some big sermon for somebody tell them what God's done for you share what God's done for you I had another meeting with a with a client this week and shared some things that God's been doing why you just throwing out a seed he said what are you doing this summer I said well we doing this and we're doing this and we got the church here and did you know we got that and and we're doing this and we're doing that he's like whoa and you never know maybe one night he'll walk through that that door just out of curiosity to see how is that guy a preacher and also doing the sort of work that he's doing what just walk through the little doors that God opens and it's up to him to water it it's up to him to make it grow into something amen we just have to be us I think that's the pressure and this is something I I'm well experienced with because you say well you're a preacher you're a pastor you know no I don't know anything half of the things I'm doing I'm doing for the first time these days but I've got to walk by faith that God has prepared me for whatever is coming my way and you're no different you're no different if you're faithful in those little things you'll find when the moment comes you've got everything that you need and just be you just be real and that's all God's looking for it's in his hands anyways it's not me that's doing it's the anointing that's on me that's the thing that we're trusting in amen God help us let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we want to be used Lord we want to be a witness we want to be a testimony Lord we want to be able to share your love and grace and goodness Lord we want to share your power Lord and witness of the good things of God lord I pray that you give each one of us a testimony Lord that we'd have a fresh one every single day every single week Lord God that we wouldn't have an old and

to just ask us to have a heart to serve Lord a heart to witness a heart to Lord just put out there what you're doing in our lives Lord if you're not doing something in our lives Lord I pray you help us to seek you to do something in our lives Lord the the the anointing is not what's lacking Lord It's a people that will cry out for it Lord I pray that we just take our hungers and our thirsts and

ourselves Lord over our habits over our time lord over this old flesh Lord and I pray you just help us to be a witness for you day by day wherever we are Lord whatever we're doing young and old men
