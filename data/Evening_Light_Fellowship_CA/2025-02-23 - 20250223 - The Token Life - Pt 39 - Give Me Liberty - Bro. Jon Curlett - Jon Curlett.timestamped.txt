[53:47] amen that God will take this message and
[53:49] use it Luke 4 Jesus reading now from the
[53:52] book of Isaiah remember he comes to
[53:54] Nazareth and he takes up the scroll and
[53:57] he reads these words out of the book of
[54:00] Isaiah the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[54:04] because he had anointed me to preach the
[54:06] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[54:09] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[54:11] Deliverance to the captives and
[54:13] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[54:16] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[54:19] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[54:22] in other words there's going to be a day
[54:23] where God says today is the day he says
[54:26] and he closed the book and he gave it
[54:28] again to the minister and sat down and
[54:30] the eyes of all that them that were in
[54:32] the synagogue were fastened upon him and
[54:34] he began to say unto them today's the
[54:37] day he says this
[54:40] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[54:43] ears amen God bless you you can have
[54:46] your seats this morning I want to take a
[54:48] title this morning we're still preaching
[54:50] on the Holy Ghost but I want to take
[54:51] this thought of Give me liberty Give me
[54:54] liberty and I I'll tell you one thing we
[54:56] we got an epidemic of people that are
[54:57] bound today and I'm not just talking
[55:00] about the world I mean we have it
[55:01] everywhere anden life is tough these
[55:03] days situations are tough The
[55:05] Temptations of this world are tough and
[55:07] it's not getting any easier amen our
[55:09] kids are facing things that are 10 times
[55:11] worse than they were when we were kids
[55:13] and it's a 100 times worse than when our
[55:15] parents were kids the things that they
[55:17] face are just so so uh completely
[55:20] enveloping they're everywhere they go
[55:22] everything they look at everything they
[55:24] hear everything they see is just trying
[55:26] to Focus to bind them to the things of
[55:28] this world and the Temptations and the
[55:30] the influences that are there and then
[55:32] we come to the spiritual side of it
[55:34] which is lukewarmness remember for for
[55:36] AIA to see and to overcome they have to
[55:38] overcome
[55:39] lukewarmness right where you say what I
[55:41] have is enough to take me there what I
[55:43] am is enough to get me there what I have
[55:45] is is of God and therefore that is
[55:47] enough but that is not the Overcomer way
[55:49] in leoa they have to recognize there is
[55:52] more and the more is Christ himself not
[55:55] just what he said but it's him it's the
[55:57] person of Christ himself and so we have
[55:59] to go beyond just knowing the truth and
[56:01] we have to come to receiving the truth
[56:04] and let that Truth live through us and
[56:05] we see in Revelations 3 that requires
[56:07] one thing and that is zealous repentance
[56:10] amen zealous repentance not just not
[56:12] just a dry-eyed confession not just a oh
[56:15] yes that's me but a life that is changed
[56:17] by our repentance if I could put it that
[56:19] way repentance doesn't mean to say I'm
[56:21] sorry repentance means to go the way
[56:23] that you weren't going before it's to
[56:25] change your way of life life amen and so
[56:27] that our Humanity our flesh doesn't like
[56:30] to repent because that means that we've
[56:32] done something wrong or we haven't done
[56:33] something completely right that we've
[56:35] got some work to do we've got changing
[56:37] to do we've got a higher Place amen it
[56:40] requires us to admit that we're not
[56:42] living as high as we're talking that's
[56:44] what that's what that zealous repentance
[56:47] does to us amen but the scripture says
[56:48] our nature our spirit in this flesh is
[56:51] that enity with God it does not get
[56:54] along with God therefore it will not get
[56:56] along with his word it will not get
[56:58] along with the people of God and so it
[57:00] has to be brought into subjection and
[57:02] just because we have the Holy Spirit
[57:04] doesn't mean we don't have our flesh
[57:06] amen it doesn't mean we're not in a
[57:07] battle we're not in a fight the Holy
[57:09] Spirit does not take away our flesh but
[57:11] rather the holy spirit is given to bring
[57:14] this flesh into subjection amen and it's
[57:17] a battle every day but it's to bring
[57:18] this flesh into subjection to bring our
[57:21] family traits to bring our genetics to
[57:23] bring our our habits our besetting sins
[57:25] to take those and bring them under
[57:26] subjection to the word of God to help us
[57:29] overcome those things so that we can
[57:31] walk out and testify of the power of God
[57:33] inside of our Lives amen but we don't
[57:35] have to be
[57:36] forced we don't have to be forced so
[57:39] many times it's unfortunate that God has
[57:41] to put us into a corner but we don't
[57:43] have to be forced we can choose to step
[57:46] into what he has for us we can choose to
[57:48] come to a place of change we can choose
[57:50] to come to a place of repentance of
[57:52] humility but if we don't then God will
[57:55] do what that Mama Eagle does is when
[57:57] it's time for the chick for the little
[57:58] eaglet chicks to fly she starts to take
[58:01] the soft things out of the nest she
[58:03] starts to make life uncomfortable and if
[58:05] there's one thing I've learned as a
[58:06] Believer it's that you cannot grow
[58:08] unless you're uncomfortable it's the
[58:10] same way in the natural it's the same
[58:12] way in the spiritual you have to be
[58:14] pushed you have to be pressed you have
[58:15] to be put into tough circumstances in
[58:18] order for there to be growth in order
[58:20] for there to be changed amen and God's
[58:22] wanting us to move from that God's
[58:24] wanting us to move from what we are are
[58:26] to what he has for us from what we are
[58:28] to what he said we were going to be to
[58:30] move from the image of Lanny and Sandy
[58:32] klet into the image of Jesus Christ my
[58:35] father that's what he's trying to do and
[58:37] I was so appreciative of that song
[58:39] sister Priscilla this morning as we
[58:40] speak on this thought of Give me liberty
[58:42] because we look at what Jesus said in
[58:44] John 8 and it says Jesus answered them
[58:47] and he said verily very verily I say
[58:49] unto you whoever commits sin is the
[58:51] servant of sin that word servant there
[58:53] is not servant it's slave whoever
[58:56] whoever commits sin is the slave of sin
[58:59] and the servant the slave abides not in
[59:02] the house forever but the son abides
[59:04] forever the Amplified says here that the
[59:06] slave is not a permanent member of the
[59:10] household they come in and they go out
[59:12] but the son is a permanent member of the
[59:14] household he says if the son therefore
[59:17] shall make you free you shall be free
[59:20] indeed you'll really be free you'll be
[59:22] more free than you ever thought you
[59:23] could be free it'll be a real Freedom it
[59:26] won't be a temporary thing but I want
[59:28] you to notice the language Jesus is
[59:30] using here he says if you commit sin you
[59:32] are a slave of sin and so often people
[59:36] get mixed up this idea of sin because
[59:37] they say it's drinking and it's
[59:39] fornicating and it's this and it's that
[59:41] and the other thing no that is the
[59:43] attribute of sin but sin is unbelief
[59:45] it's to disbelieve the word of God so if
[59:49] Jesus is saying if you disbelieve the
[59:51] word if you take something above the
[59:53] word of God you're a slave and to stay
[59:56] there means you'll stay a slave if
[59:58] you'll dis if you you'll you'll
[1:00:00] disbelieve the word of God you cannot
[1:00:02] come into your position as a son or a
[1:00:04] daughter of God and he says if you don't
[1:00:08] believe the word you don't get to stay
[1:00:09] in the house all the time and we'll find
[1:00:12] out why that is as we come to the end of
[1:00:13] this service you come in and out but
[1:00:15] you're not
[1:00:16] settled let me tell you church if the
[1:00:18] only time we get to see God is when we
[1:00:20] come to church we're under a slave
[1:00:22] mentality this morning if the only time
[1:00:25] we can feel the presence of God is when
[1:00:26] we're in church we're under a slave
[1:00:28] mentality because we are not in his
[1:00:30] presence we're coming in and we're going
[1:00:32] out we're coming in and we're going out
[1:00:34] and that's not the nature of a child of
[1:00:36] God that's the nature of a slave that's
[1:00:38] the nature of somebody that doesn't get
[1:00:39] to stay there but he says if he makes
[1:00:42] you free you'll be free indeed if he
[1:00:44] gives you a revelation that you're not a
[1:00:46] slave that you are a son that you are a
[1:00:49] daughter he says that's the thing that's
[1:00:51] going to set you free you'll notice here
[1:00:53] your intended position is not a Slave
[1:00:56] it's not to be a servant in this case
[1:00:58] your intended position is to be a child
[1:01:00] of God sitting in the presence of the
[1:01:02] father all the time that's your intended
[1:01:04] position amen but remember what God does
[1:01:06] is he sends his Spirit to us and we cry
[1:01:09] out Abba Father and we realize who we
[1:01:11] are in relation to him and that cry
[1:01:14] draws us into his presence and it starts
[1:01:17] a work in our life to change what is on
[1:01:19] the outside to match what is on the
[1:01:22] inside cuz we always were a son we
[1:01:24] always were a daughter but now we
[1:01:26] realize it and now the spirit of God
[1:01:28] goes to work by the washing of the water
[1:01:30] of the word and it takes us out of the
[1:01:32] slavery of this flesh out of the slavery
[1:01:34] of habits out of the slavery of religion
[1:01:36] out of the slavery of tradition out of
[1:01:38] the slavery of our emotions uh whatever
[1:01:41] we might have this morning and it takes
[1:01:43] us into the perfect Liberty of the Sons
[1:01:45] and Daughters of God that's what he sent
[1:01:47] the holy spirit for and if we look in
[1:01:49] the scriptures so many times that that
[1:01:52] slaves they could not help that they
[1:01:54] were slaves to start
[1:01:56] we sang that song here that he's in the
[1:01:58] house we were like that little girl dead
[1:02:00] in all our sins we are born in
[1:02:03] slavery but it's whether we stay in
[1:02:05] slavery that is the choice when you look
[1:02:08] at the the children of Israel they could
[1:02:10] they could fall into a time of slavery
[1:02:13] they could lose their inheritance for a
[1:02:15] time but there came a day there came a
[1:02:18] year on the day of Jubilee where they
[1:02:20] would blow the trumpet and if they heard
[1:02:22] that trumpet and they recognized what it
[1:02:24] meant then they got to go free but if
[1:02:28] they recognized what it didn't recognize
[1:02:30] what it meant nothing changed but here's
[1:02:33] the thing they could recognize what it
[1:02:34] meant and not take advantage of it and
[1:02:36] they would choose to stay a slave for
[1:02:38] the rest of their life and so they take
[1:02:40] them to the to the doorpost and they
[1:02:42] take an all and they' they'd wrap a the
[1:02:44] all through their ear and they put a a
[1:02:46] ring there and that ring would bind them
[1:02:48] for the rest of their life they were a
[1:02:49] slave Now by choice not by circumstance
[1:02:52] and so often we go through trials and
[1:02:54] circumstances and and hard times and
[1:02:57] situations we're not meant to be bound
[1:02:59] by those we're not meant to be bound by
[1:03:01] them but we can choose to be bound by
[1:03:03] those things and I want to start on this
[1:03:05] idea of how does somebody become a slave
[1:03:07] yes we're born in sin yes we we come and
[1:03:10] this flesh binds us and we're a slave to
[1:03:12] that but we're talking now to
[1:03:14] Believers because we can come into a
[1:03:17] place where we're bound up in something
[1:03:19] and yet we are a child of God and we
[1:03:21] ought not to be but we are because
[1:03:23] something has held Us in in some form of
[1:03:25] bondage amen and we we look at that last
[1:03:28] Church age in leoda that's where we are
[1:03:30] today we're in leoda we're in the last
[1:03:32] Church age and it's the worst of all the
[1:03:34] ages in Revelation 3 God has nothing
[1:03:37] good to say about the lean Church
[1:03:39] age the only bright spot there is that
[1:03:42] there is an
[1:03:43] overcomer and the Overcomer is those
[1:03:45] that are what willing to let Christ come
[1:03:48] into their lives he's outside of the
[1:03:50] church remember they're worshiping a
[1:03:52] Christ of their own imagination of their
[1:03:54] own making they put the word out and
[1:03:57] with that word went the Living Word they
[1:03:59] put out the truth of this word of God
[1:04:01] and they put it out and so Christ is now
[1:04:03] on the outside and he's knocking on
[1:04:04] individual lives because he's trying to
[1:04:07] find the
[1:04:08] Overcomers and there's going to be a
[1:04:10] people that let him into their lives
[1:04:12] amen but we know that leod deia means
[1:04:14] people's rights and you'll find today
[1:04:16] that a slave mentality is bound up so
[1:04:19] often in your right to hold on to
[1:04:21] certain things you only need to listen
[1:04:23] to the news once or twice and you can
[1:04:25] see that people today are worshiping
[1:04:27] their feelings they're worshiping their
[1:04:29] circumstances they're worshiping their
[1:04:31] genetics they're worshiping whatever
[1:04:33] they are saddled
[1:04:36] with and they don't want to be made
[1:04:38] uncomfortable by those things and so
[1:04:40] they'd rather stay the way they are and
[1:04:42] have everyone come around them and Pat
[1:04:44] them on the back and coddle them where
[1:04:45] they are rather than come up into the
[1:04:48] Liberty that's there if you can admit
[1:04:49] where you are and that there's a way out
[1:04:51] of those things and what you see today
[1:04:53] is the result of people that are not
[1:04:55] held accountable that are not challenged
[1:04:57] that are not offered the truth that are
[1:04:59] not held uh uh subject to the facts that
[1:05:02] are before us and so now you have a
[1:05:05] place where people can't even recognize
[1:05:06] or accept truth anymore because they're
[1:05:09] so used to people saying that whatever
[1:05:11] you think is right whatever you feel is
[1:05:14] right whatever you want is right and
[1:05:16] it's not right the truth is
[1:05:18] absolute and what we have is a b bunch
[1:05:21] of absolutes which doesn't make sense
[1:05:22] because they're all contradiction
[1:05:24] themselves and so what we've got today
[1:05:26] is we've got a victim mentality which is
[1:05:28] a slave mentality of people that don't
[1:05:30] want to be held accountable to the truth
[1:05:33] and because of that they do not change
[1:05:36] and because of that they spiral lower
[1:05:38] and lower and lower and they never get
[1:05:40] to a place where they can move on from
[1:05:41] these things and so we've got people
[1:05:42] that are hearing what they want to hear
[1:05:44] rather than what they need to hear Paul
[1:05:46] told Timothy that's what was going to
[1:05:47] happen he says in second
[1:05:50] Timothy he's speaking now to Timothy he
[1:05:52] says Timothy preach the word be in
[1:05:55] instant in season now that's the easiest
[1:05:58] time to preach church is when it's in
[1:05:59] season cuz that means the people are
[1:06:02] willing and ready to hear you but then
[1:06:05] he says Timothy now preach it out of
[1:06:07] season too so when people don't want to
[1:06:10] hear what you have to say when people
[1:06:11] aren't willing to hear what you say he
[1:06:13] says Timothy you've got to say it anyway
[1:06:15] because if you don't say it they don't
[1:06:17] have an opportunity to get out of where
[1:06:18] they
[1:06:20] are we've got to be able to speak the
[1:06:22] truth in love even if nobody wants to
[1:06:25] hear it
[1:06:27] he says what's that going to look like
[1:06:28] it's going to be reproving rebuking
[1:06:31] exhorting with all long suffering and
[1:06:34] Doctrine
[1:06:35] patient if they don't take it the first
[1:06:38] time give it to them the second time
[1:06:40] stick with it don't let them walk away
[1:06:42] because they don't accept it the first
[1:06:44] time stick with it be patient he says
[1:06:48] for the time will come when they will
[1:06:50] not endure sound Doctrine but after
[1:06:53] their own lust shall they Heap to
[1:06:55] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:06:58] they want somebody to scratch their
[1:06:59] lustful itch and it's to tell them what
[1:07:02] they want to believe what they want to
[1:07:04] happen how they want life to be rather
[1:07:06] than the way God wants them to be he
[1:07:09] says and they shall turn away their ears
[1:07:11] from the truth that's a choice that's a
[1:07:14] choice they shall turn their ears away
[1:07:17] that's a choice and it says and they
[1:07:19] shall be turned unto fables there's the
[1:07:21] result you reject the truth you'll
[1:07:24] believe a lie
[1:07:26] you'll get to the place where you'll
[1:07:28] you'll say a lie to yourself and you'll
[1:07:29] believe your own lie that's how far this
[1:07:32] goes where are we at today we are at a
[1:07:35] place where people will believe fables
[1:07:38] rather than the truth because it's more
[1:07:40] convenient to believe the lie than to
[1:07:41] accept the truth you can see it in media
[1:07:44] you can see it in government you can see
[1:07:45] it in religion you can see it in
[1:07:48] business all these things that you have
[1:07:51] a people that can't hear the truth
[1:07:53] because it's too uncomfortable and it
[1:07:55] puts them in the spotlight that they're
[1:07:57] not where they ought to
[1:07:59] be what happens when people get
[1:08:01] uncomfortable with the
[1:08:03] truth they turn it away and what do they
[1:08:06] do they find like-minded
[1:08:08] people that think the way they do that
[1:08:11] feel the way they do that live the way
[1:08:12] they do and they'll create a band
[1:08:15] they'll create a denomination is what
[1:08:17] they'll do whether it's religious or not
[1:08:19] it doesn't matter it's religious it's
[1:08:20] not the word but it's religious and it
[1:08:22] can be bounded around the lifestyle you
[1:08:24] live the marriage you have the things
[1:08:26] you do the things you don't do whatever
[1:08:27] it is and they'll bind themselves by
[1:08:29] emotion they'll bind themselves by
[1:08:30] having a large number of people and
[1:08:32] they'll get there and they'll beat down
[1:08:34] anybody that doesn't do it the way they
[1:08:36] say that's the way we see things today
[1:08:38] isn't it you see these alternative
[1:08:39] Lifestyles that they're trying to cram
[1:08:40] down everybody's
[1:08:42] throat you got 5% of the population
[1:08:45] trying to control 95% of the population
[1:08:48] with
[1:08:49] emotion w w with with all of this
[1:08:51] rhetoric with all of these this harsh
[1:08:54] attitude
[1:08:56] judging people by the word not even
[1:08:58] knowing what the word says that's what
[1:09:00] we have
[1:09:02] today you say brother John we're not in
[1:09:05] that group but we can get in that group
[1:09:08] let me tell you it's it's an amazing
[1:09:09] thing if you ever go to a youth
[1:09:12] camp the bad kids always find the bad
[1:09:15] kids the ones that are smoking pot
[1:09:17] always find the ones that are smoking
[1:09:19] pot the ones that are listening to rock
[1:09:21] music on the side always find the ones
[1:09:22] that are listening to rock music on the
[1:09:23] side it happens without without fail you
[1:09:26] go ask any preacher that's been to a
[1:09:28] youth camp they'll say you want to find
[1:09:29] one bad kid just look for the one you
[1:09:31] know and the rest of them will be around
[1:09:33] them they just find each other and they
[1:09:35] they they they they they just they're
[1:09:38] drawn to each
[1:09:39] other but that's the way it ought to be
[1:09:41] for a Believer when it comes to the
[1:09:43] truth but what can happen is we can get
[1:09:46] into situations where we get burned we
[1:09:48] get hurt we have a certain thing that we
[1:09:50] do or we don't do and we can link up
[1:09:52] with people on the basis of that rather
[1:09:54] than on the basis of the word of God
[1:09:56] and you can end up now bound up in your
[1:09:58] emotions because somebody else's been
[1:09:59] hurt the same way you do and what are
[1:10:02] you doing you're codling each other in
[1:10:03] your emotion rather than bringing each
[1:10:05] other into the truth of the word of God
[1:10:07] absolutely we can do it
[1:10:10] amen what we can we can come to a place
[1:10:14] where we protect areas we don't want to
[1:10:16] change and how do we protect it we find
[1:10:17] a like-minded person to support us in
[1:10:20] that area where we don't want to change
[1:10:22] cuz they don't want to change either and
[1:10:24] so we end upor supporting each other but
[1:10:26] let me start right there we don't want
[1:10:28] to change even though we know we ought
[1:10:33] to even though we know we ought to we
[1:10:35] don't want to do it because we see the
[1:10:37] work that's ahead we see the pain that's
[1:10:40] ahead we see the truth that's ahead we
[1:10:42] see The Humbling that's ahead we see the
[1:10:44] repentance that's up ahead we see the
[1:10:47] hard conversations that are up ahead and
[1:10:49] we say no I'd rather stay
[1:10:52] here with my truth with my feelings with
[1:10:55] my hurt with whatever it might
[1:10:58] be and what do we do we stay in the
[1:11:01] image that we're born in rather than the
[1:11:02] image that Christ has for
[1:11:05] us instead of saying I need help I need
[1:11:08] Deliverance I need growth I need change
[1:11:12] we say I just want to stay the way I
[1:11:15] am these things would require us to
[1:11:18] repent because we've been bound and
[1:11:21] we're bound Now by
[1:11:23] choice not by circumstance
[1:11:26] we moved beyond the circumstance the
[1:11:28] circumstance has moved on Beyond us and
[1:11:29] we're still Bound by what happened in
[1:11:31] those things and and that slave
[1:11:33] mentality that victim mentality it
[1:11:34] always puts the blame on somebody else a
[1:11:36] victim puts the blame on somebody else
[1:11:38] and a slave puts the blame on the
[1:11:41] circumstances because you say I can't
[1:11:43] help but I'm a slave you look at these
[1:11:45] poor poor people that were were captured
[1:11:47] and and and sold into slavery they
[1:11:49] couldn't help that but how they acted in
[1:11:52] their slavery they could act they they
[1:11:53] could they could act they they could
[1:11:55] could hold themselves accountable for
[1:11:57] and there comes a time where you've got
[1:11:58] to make a choice remember brother BR
[1:11:59] would tell that story about that man
[1:12:01] that went to a slave to a plantation and
[1:12:03] he was looking at all the slaves and he
[1:12:04] says I only want to buy one slave he
[1:12:06] says it's that guy over there and the
[1:12:08] guy says you can't have him he says why
[1:12:10] he says he's my best worker he says but
[1:12:12] why is he so good he says I've been
[1:12:13] watching him the whole time what's
[1:12:15] what's so different about him he says
[1:12:16] back home he's a prince he's the son of
[1:12:18] a
[1:12:19] king and he didn't let his circumstances
[1:12:21] change the way that he acted he was a
[1:12:24] prince and he acted like a Prince no
[1:12:25] matter where he was because he knew it
[1:12:27] was a reflection of where he came from
[1:12:29] and what his position was in all of
[1:12:31] these
[1:12:33] things but that slave mentality says I
[1:12:36] can act the way I want to because I'm
[1:12:38] put in circumstances that I couldn't
[1:12:40] control and listen Church we're all born
[1:12:43] into circumstances we can't control I
[1:12:46] can't control the desires and the urges
[1:12:47] that I was born with and neither can you
[1:12:50] I can't control the actions and the
[1:12:52] reactions the way this Body Works any
[1:12:53] more than you can but we can bow down to
[1:12:56] those things because we don't go to God
[1:12:58] and say God I need a change God I want
[1:13:01] the promise
[1:13:02] change I want the promise change not
[1:13:05] just I want to change but I want the
[1:13:07] promise change that you give me a new
[1:13:09] spirit that you give me a new heart that
[1:13:10] you would change the way that I live my
[1:13:15] life you want to know who's a slave
[1:13:18] they're pointing at the circumstance or
[1:13:20] they're pointing at the other
[1:13:21] person rather than at what the word of
[1:13:24] God says is a available for them in
[1:13:26] their situation in their life and in
[1:13:28] their body and these different things it
[1:13:30] started in the very beginning you
[1:13:31] remember when Adam said the woman that
[1:13:33] thou gave me what did Adam say he says
[1:13:36] God you gave me a flawed wife any
[1:13:38] brothers here have a flawed
[1:13:40] wife I
[1:13:42] do you do too me and Joe have flawed
[1:13:46] wives why CU they're born in sin and
[1:13:48] shaped in iniquity same as the same as
[1:13:50] the how many wives have flaw
[1:13:53] husbands my wife has one well there you
[1:13:57] go what's good for the goose is good for
[1:13:59] the gander isn't it but we've got to
[1:14:02] we've got to be able to recognize that
[1:14:04] we're in a battle we're in a fight and
[1:14:07] just cuz we're born that way doesn't
[1:14:08] mean we've got to stay that way listen
[1:14:11] look look at our elders here I now I
[1:14:14] didn't know brother Mark when he looked
[1:14:15] like a hippie but guess what he doesn't
[1:14:17] look like a hippie today brother Bob I
[1:14:20] heard was the worst of the worst
[1:14:25] brother Gerald was always a
[1:14:27] saint he was a he was a man born into a
[1:14:30] particular
[1:14:32] role but let me tell you I can see the
[1:14:35] smiles on the faces here sister sister
[1:14:38] Brenda is is holding in a giggle because
[1:14:40] she knows the way she used to be she
[1:14:43] knows the way brother Bob used to be you
[1:14:45] know what you were but guess what
[1:14:48] something changed you something set you
[1:14:51] free listen you came from a drunkard you
[1:14:55] came from a drunker brother Mark and
[1:14:56] brother
[1:14:57] Bob I don't see any drunks here
[1:15:01] today drunk on the word
[1:15:04] maybe but you say I've got a
[1:15:08] temper I've got a this I've got a that
[1:15:11] I'm born with
[1:15:13] it Church we're all born
[1:15:16] broken we're all born in in sin we're
[1:15:19] all born with flaws and
[1:15:22] issues but you got proof today that the
[1:15:24] the Holy Ghost can take those things out
[1:15:26] of your
[1:15:27] life it may be in You by
[1:15:31] genetics hardcoded into your life and
[1:15:35] that will not stop the power of the holy
[1:15:38] spirit in your life
[1:15:40] hallelujah we're preaching on Give me
[1:15:42] liberty this morning we can dwell on
[1:15:45] those things that we've gotten from our
[1:15:47] dad from our mom from our grandparents
[1:15:50] from a Ministry from a friend from a bad
[1:15:53] situation from a circumstance sense and
[1:15:55] we say it's built into me now I can't
[1:15:57] get rid of it I'm here to tell you this
[1:15:59] morning there's liberty there is Liberty
[1:16:02] from whatever you're dealing with this
[1:16:04] morning but you got to be able to lay it
[1:16:06] down you got to be able to say I don't
[1:16:09] want it
[1:16:11] anymore and Lord I'm holding you at your
[1:16:14] promise for it this
[1:16:17] morning we can't help what happens in
[1:16:19] this
[1:16:20] life we can't help the things that that
[1:16:23] that we're put into amen where we can
[1:16:25] live by the word every single day and
[1:16:28] still experience hardships and failures
[1:16:31] and faults and flaws and hurts and
[1:16:37] offenses we can't help so many of those
[1:16:39] things some we can but many we can't
[1:16:42] amen Jesus said we'd be rejected we'd be
[1:16:46] abused we'd be persecuted we'd be kicked
[1:16:48] out we'd be ill spoken of we'd be beaten
[1:16:52] up and we have been at different times
[1:16:55] and in different
[1:16:57] ways people can say things that leave us
[1:16:59] scarred for
[1:17:00] life people can do things that leave us
[1:17:03] scared for life and what happens is it
[1:17:05] causes us to protect those
[1:17:07] areas and wrap things up and build a
[1:17:10] shell around those things it may happen
[1:17:12] as a child it may happen as a young
[1:17:14] person happen when you're married
[1:17:16] whatever it is we get damaged we get
[1:17:17] hurt and so what do we do we build this
[1:17:19] wall we build a fortress around these
[1:17:21] things and we become a slave to that
[1:17:25] event a slave to that word a slave to
[1:17:28] that situation a slave to that influence
[1:17:30] and we say never
[1:17:32] again never
[1:17:35] again guess what that's not going to
[1:17:38] stop it from happening again it doesn't
[1:17:41] I can tell you this morning it's not
[1:17:43] amen and so then we say because of that
[1:17:46] Fortress we say now I'm no longer
[1:17:48] responsible for what happens they did
[1:17:51] this they did that they didn't do this
[1:17:53] they didn't do that they said this they
[1:17:55] said
[1:17:58] that and we get the shell in our lives
[1:18:02] and Lead deia feeds that mentality Lea
[1:18:05] feeds that mentality because a slave
[1:18:08] believes they have no part in getting
[1:18:10] where they are and therefore they're not
[1:18:12] responsible for what happens from that
[1:18:14] point on let me tell you if you're a
[1:18:16] child of God you have an opportunity to
[1:18:19] move past those things amen slaves rest
[1:18:23] on the fact that it's out of my hands
[1:18:25] it's beyond my control and therefore I'm
[1:18:28] not responsible for anything we have so
[1:18:31] many people in the scripture that could
[1:18:32] have been slaves to their circumstances
[1:18:35] and yet they weren't they had all sorts
[1:18:37] of reasons not to change they were
[1:18:39] slaves but they didn't act like
[1:18:42] slaves amen they may have physically
[1:18:44] literally been slaves but they didn't
[1:18:46] let those circumstances dictate the way
[1:18:49] that they acted you look at somebody
[1:18:51] like Rahab rahab's a prostitute used and
[1:18:55] abused by men all her
[1:18:57] life who knows how she got there she's
[1:19:01] there and she could say my entire life
[1:19:05] I've been abandoned by
[1:19:08] God I've got
[1:19:10] nothing she could be bitter she could be
[1:19:13] hurt she could have a bad attitude she
[1:19:15] could be cranky all the time and we'd
[1:19:16] say Rahab you've got good reason to do
[1:19:19] that but what happened Church she saw
[1:19:22] Liberty in one moment
[1:19:25] and she said I'll take it and what
[1:19:27] happened when she took that Liberty is
[1:19:29] God buried every portion of her past and
[1:19:33] she walked away and she married a
[1:19:35] captain a general in the army of Israel
[1:19:37] and she came into the the the the
[1:19:40] bloodline of Jesus
[1:19:42] Christ because she said I'll take
[1:19:45] Liberty when it comes my way rather than
[1:19:48] sit here and say this is God's
[1:19:53] fault look at the woman at the
[1:19:56] well married five times living common
[1:20:00] law with a
[1:20:01] man keeps making the same bad decision
[1:20:05] over and over and over again until now
[1:20:08] she's made an even worse
[1:20:11] one she couldn't get the
[1:20:14] victory she believed the word but she
[1:20:17] couldn't get the Victory and she was
[1:20:19] left with more questions and
[1:20:23] answers she she's been persecuted she's
[1:20:26] been an outcast she's got to walk up to
[1:20:29] the to the well in the middle of the day
[1:20:30] when the sun's at its
[1:20:33] hottest every single
[1:20:35] day everybody can look at her walking
[1:20:38] that lonely trip up to that well and say
[1:20:41] there goes a fallen
[1:20:43] woman you talk about a
[1:20:45] slave but one day Liberty came her way
[1:20:50] and instead of backing away instead of
[1:20:52] wrapping that shell tighter around her
[1:20:55] what did she do she opened up to it and
[1:20:58] she got set
[1:20:59] free she went on to get the Holy Ghost I
[1:21:02] believe when when when they came down to
[1:21:06] Samaria the book of Acts came down
[1:21:08] Philip was down there preaching and then
[1:21:10] Paul or sorry Peter and John came down
[1:21:12] and they prayed for them and they got
[1:21:13] the Holy Ghost I believe she went all
[1:21:15] that way because she opened up and she
[1:21:17] let the word do a work in her that she'd
[1:21:20] been trying to do all of her life and
[1:21:22] what it did was it satisfied the things
[1:21:24] You' been trying to satisfy all that
[1:21:28] time you look at her you say poor thing
[1:21:31] she's had a rough life I don't blame her
[1:21:34] church I don't blame us for the way we
[1:21:37] act
[1:21:39] sometimes but what I say is when God
[1:21:41] gives us an opportunity to have
[1:21:43] Liberty that's where we got to take some
[1:21:46] responsibility amen we're allowed to
[1:21:49] mourn we're allowed to be hurt we're
[1:21:52] allowed to be offended
[1:21:55] we're just not allowed to stay there
[1:21:57] amen look at Joseph we spent a fair bit
[1:22:00] of time talking about him last Serv a
[1:22:01] prophet of God chosen ordained favored
[1:22:04] of God with
[1:22:05] gifts is sold into slavery by his own
[1:22:08] family goes to work for the the captain
[1:22:10] of the Guard falsely accused assaulting
[1:22:13] assaulting a woman goes to prison has
[1:22:15] done nothing wrong and yet everything
[1:22:16] has gone
[1:22:18] wrong he's a literal slave and then he's
[1:22:20] a slave prisoner on top of it everything
[1:22:23] has come crumbling around them it went
[1:22:25] from bad to worse to
[1:22:27] worser nothing's going well for Joseph
[1:22:30] amen he's a from a son to a slave to a
[1:22:32] prisoner and slave his circumstance just
[1:22:35] get getting worse and worse and worse
[1:22:37] through no fault of his own and yet
[1:22:40] Joseph never had a slave
[1:22:42] mentality Joseph had a son of God
[1:22:46] mentality he wasn't Bound by
[1:22:48] circumstances he was held by the promise
[1:22:50] of God in his life David a Shepherd boy
[1:22:55] a a happy Shepherd boy happy to do what
[1:22:57] he was doing gets called by God is
[1:22:59] brought out by the prophet Samuel
[1:23:01] anointed to be king the spirit of God
[1:23:03] comes upon him he has a changed life and
[1:23:05] then he has to run for his life for the
[1:23:07] next 15 years and he's he's he's he's
[1:23:10] hounded hounded
[1:23:13] constantly everything he does is for the
[1:23:15] king's good he's loyal to the king he
[1:23:17] goes in and he sings songs and gets a
[1:23:19] spear thrown at him
[1:23:22] twice Saul wants his life even though
[1:23:24] David has done nothing but be loyal to
[1:23:27] the king and for 15 years David is
[1:23:30] always scrambling he's just one step
[1:23:32] ahead of death on a constant
[1:23:36] basis does that change
[1:23:39] David oh David has his down moments go
[1:23:41] read the Psalms he has his down moments
[1:23:43] but David has his his up moments too he
[1:23:47] doesn't stay there he doesn't stay in
[1:23:49] those places church you can look at your
[1:23:51] life this morning look at it this
[1:23:52] morning by all means and say where have
[1:23:54] I been dragged down where have I been
[1:23:57] bound up where have people hurt me where
[1:23:59] have circumstances bound me where am I
[1:24:01] holding on to something that I should be
[1:24:03] passed by
[1:24:06] now and say where's the promise of the
[1:24:10] word versus the promise of lead to seea
[1:24:12] that it's okay to hold on to these
[1:24:15] things we can review every
[1:24:19] situation and we can have every reason
[1:24:21] laid out for where we are where we are
[1:24:23] today for how we are we can pinpoint the
[1:24:26] person we can pinpoint the cause the
[1:24:29] time the place the issue the words the
[1:24:33] feelings that came with it we can
[1:24:35] justify our actions we can justify our
[1:24:37] reactions we can justify the
[1:24:39] fortifications we built up around those
[1:24:41] things in our lives and we can pinpoint
[1:24:43] it perfectly what caused it and let me
[1:24:45] tell you knowing the cause Won't Set You
[1:24:48] Free knowing who to blame Won't Set You
[1:24:51] Free I've heard too many people talk
[1:24:53] about let's dig in and find out the
[1:24:55] cause the cause isn't
[1:24:57] enough the cause doesn't set you free it
[1:24:59] might give you an understanding but it
[1:25:02] doesn't give you a freedom it doesn't
[1:25:04] give you Liberty amen we're all broken
[1:25:05] we're all in sinful flesh as I said Paul
[1:25:07] said in this flesh dwells no good thing
[1:25:12] it's hard to be a
[1:25:13] human it's a tough life amen and so
[1:25:17] knowing these things won't change a
[1:25:18] single thing but when we come to those
[1:25:20] places and we start to list out why we
[1:25:23] are where we are and how we can't move
[1:25:25] forward we're ducking our Liberty
[1:25:27] because it's easier to claim the reason
[1:25:30] the excuse because it's on somebody
[1:25:33] else you know what you look at something
[1:25:37] like
[1:25:38] forgiveness see too often we're waiting
[1:25:40] for that person to come and forgive to
[1:25:42] to say I'm
[1:25:43] sorry listen the only person that's
[1:25:46] Bound by unforgiveness is me if I can't
[1:25:49] forgive you I'm bound you may be running
[1:25:51] out there free as a bird you don't know
[1:25:53] that you've done anything wrong to me
[1:25:56] that lack of forgiveness binds me it
[1:25:58] doesn't bind
[1:25:59] you and so we can sit here waiting for
[1:26:02] the other person to make the move and
[1:26:04] we'll stay there the rest of our life we
[1:26:06] don't know what we don't
[1:26:08] know amen but we take these
[1:26:10] circumstances and we put it above the
[1:26:12] power of the word of God we put it above
[1:26:14] the power of the Holy Spirit and we let
[1:26:16] it build up a fortress inside of our
[1:26:18] life and what are we saying we're saying
[1:26:20] I'm a slave rather than I'm a son or a
[1:26:23] daughter of God
[1:26:25] we can sit here all day long and talk
[1:26:26] about the reasons and the excuses and
[1:26:28] the people and the situations and all
[1:26:30] these things and we end up being
[1:26:31] worshippers of the situation rather than
[1:26:34] the god that told us he can set us free
[1:26:35] from those
[1:26:37] things we're not here to talk about
[1:26:40] reasons you will never find
[1:26:43] anywhere
[1:26:45] anywhere where God says your reasons are
[1:26:47] good
[1:26:50] enough nowhere you'll never find him say
[1:26:53] that
[1:26:55] what you'll find him say my grace is
[1:26:57] sufficient for thee Paul right I've
[1:27:00] never seen the righteous
[1:27:02] forsaken by his stripes we are
[1:27:06] healed he will keep him in perfect peace
[1:27:09] whose heart is stayed on thee whose mind
[1:27:12] is stayed on thee you'll see the promise
[1:27:15] you'll never see God look at the excuse
[1:27:17] or the reason but what he'll point you
[1:27:18] to is the Liberty that he offers from
[1:27:20] those things
[1:27:22] amen other what do we do we end up with
[1:27:25] this why me
[1:27:27] attitude and why me becomes
[1:27:32] wiy and all of a sudden now we're
[1:27:34] wrapped up in an eore attitude of why me
[1:27:38] why me why me and Satan will give us
[1:27:42] every reason and every excuse to stay
[1:27:45] there it's so easy to just Retreat into
[1:27:49] the circumstance to retreat into the
[1:27:51] hurt Retreat into the pain Retreat into
[1:27:53] the reason
[1:27:54] rather than look for the way out because
[1:27:57] too many people are there to coddle you
[1:27:58] in the reasons rather than lead you out
[1:28:02] but the holy spirit's here to lead us
[1:28:03] out that's what the word's supposed to
[1:28:05] do amen it's so easy to get caught up in
[1:28:07] where we are rather than where he told
[1:28:09] us we could be in those things remember
[1:28:12] what Jesus said if you're a slave you're
[1:28:14] bound in unbelief but I want to set you
[1:28:16] free I want to set you free from what's
[1:28:19] making you come in and go
[1:28:21] out and I want you to come in and stay
[1:28:25] be in my presence I want to make you a
[1:28:27] son and a daughter I want to make you
[1:28:28] truly
[1:28:30] free but let me start with this you can
[1:28:33] only be a son if you are a son you can
[1:28:36] only be a daughter if you are a daughter
[1:28:39] when we look at this change here from
[1:28:41] slavery from slave into sun this is not
[1:28:43] a changing it's a changing of of who you
[1:28:47] recognize you are but you always were a
[1:28:49] son you always were a daughter of God
[1:28:51] Amen I didn't become a klette when I
[1:28:53] started acting like a klet I always was
[1:28:56] a klet and it's the same thing with the
[1:28:58] child of God remember what brother Bram
[1:29:00] says he says you can be a child of God a
[1:29:01] long time and not know it but when you
[1:29:04] know it that's the working of the holy
[1:29:06] spirit in your life and it's to bring
[1:29:07] you out of who you are into what you
[1:29:09] always were it's to take you past your
[1:29:11] natural birth into your origin in Christ
[1:29:14] in the mind of God when your name was
[1:29:16] written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen
[1:29:18] but but God's trying to get us to
[1:29:19] realize who we are who we are and what
[1:29:22] comes with realizing who we are is is
[1:29:24] the inheritance of a son and a daughter
[1:29:25] of God see we we we have this idea that
[1:29:28] we've got to be perfect to come to God
[1:29:31] we've got to be perfect we got to have
[1:29:32] the perfect marriage we got to have
[1:29:33] dressed perfectly we got to have perfect
[1:29:35] Doctrine we've got to have perfect
[1:29:37] kids go to a perfect Church perfect job
[1:29:41] perfect time
[1:29:42] management no besetting sins and that
[1:29:46] couldn't be further from the truth Jesus
[1:29:48] said you're going to start out as a
[1:29:50] slave no matter who you are you're going
[1:29:52] to be a Slave and you're going to be
[1:29:55] brought into a place where you can
[1:29:56] realize that you're a son listen to what
[1:29:58] Paul said to the Corinthians he says
[1:30:00] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[1:30:01] not inherit the kingdom of God be not
[1:30:04] deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:30:06] idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate
[1:30:08] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:30:10] nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards
[1:30:12] nor revilers extortioners shall inherit
[1:30:14] the kingdom of
[1:30:15] God he says and such were some of
[1:30:19] you listen when they came to Corinth
[1:30:21] they did not come and find Perfect
[1:30:23] People
[1:30:25] they came and they found really really
[1:30:27] nasty perverted
[1:30:29] people that's who Paul was preaching to
[1:30:33] perverts sickos
[1:30:36] weirdos drunks
[1:30:39] pars sleeping
[1:30:41] around he says but such were some of you
[1:30:44] but ye are washed ye are Sanctified you
[1:30:48] are justified in the name of the Lord
[1:30:50] Jesus and by the spirit of the
[1:30:52] god Paul had to talk to the Corinthians
[1:30:55] so many times we've talked about this in
[1:30:57] the past he had to rebuke them
[1:30:59] constantly to get them to come into the
[1:31:02] liberty of
[1:31:03] Christ but they were
[1:31:06] changed they didn't stay in their
[1:31:08] original condition but they came to
[1:31:10] Christ completely flawed and he turned
[1:31:12] them into perfect Sons and Daughters of
[1:31:14] God we don't have to come perfect we
[1:31:17] have to come willing to be
[1:31:19] changed that's what it's about the a
[1:31:21] life surrendered to Christ is all that
[1:31:23] he requires he will do the work as
[1:31:24] brother Garfield preached the other
[1:31:26] night Perfection is God's work not my
[1:31:27] work or your work he's the one that's
[1:31:29] going to do that job that idea of change
[1:31:31] means we aren't what we ought to be and
[1:31:34] we've got to be able to recognize I need
[1:31:36] to change because I'm not what I am
[1:31:39] supposed to be it's okay to say I'm not
[1:31:42] what I'm supposed to be as long as you
[1:31:44] don't hold on to what you are right
[1:31:46] now that's all it's okay in fact I
[1:31:49] encourage us be honest this morning this
[1:31:52] is where I am
[1:31:54] but Lord this is what you said I'm
[1:31:56] supposed to be so I'm going to step into
[1:31:58] the Liberty that you
[1:31:59] offer by the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:02] and I'm going to let you do a work in my
[1:32:03] life you know I heard a I think it was
[1:32:05] brother codre dig say this I don't know
[1:32:07] if it was on the the service we listened
[1:32:08] to on Wednesday night or a different
[1:32:10] what I heard him say he said at some
[1:32:11] point we have to stop being a Corinthian
[1:32:13] and start being an
[1:32:15] Ephesian we've got to we've got to come
[1:32:18] where we've we we're not holding on to
[1:32:20] things where we're not holding on to the
[1:32:21] old life where we're not holding on to
[1:32:22] the old hurts where were letting go
[1:32:24] completely of what we were so we can
[1:32:26] come into the liberty of Christ because
[1:32:29] in Ephesian in Ephesus they were a
[1:32:32] church it was Paul's home church if you
[1:32:33] remember and that home Church they had
[1:32:36] seen what the power of God could do and
[1:32:38] they'd let it do a work in their life
[1:32:40] and now they were moving into adoption
[1:32:42] they're moving into placing because they
[1:32:44] moved past the old life and they were
[1:32:47] now a completely new creature in Christ
[1:32:49] and he was forming them and shaping them
[1:32:50] into his body into his bride
[1:32:54] you know I've dealt with a lot of
[1:32:55] personal issues in my life emotion lack
[1:32:57] of emotion bottling things up letting
[1:32:59] past experiences hold on to me and I've
[1:33:01] said this before one day I realized if I
[1:33:03] stick with this route it'll destroy my
[1:33:06] marriage it'll destroy my Ministry it'll
[1:33:08] destroy my family it'll destroy my
[1:33:10] kids and what did I have to do I had to
[1:33:13] go to God and say God I want to
[1:33:16] change that's
[1:33:18] simple and what did he do he changed me
[1:33:23] and he's continuing to change me the
[1:33:24] work ain't done yet the work's not done
[1:33:27] yet but he's continuing to change
[1:33:29] because I have a desire by the Holy
[1:33:31] Spirit In Me by the hearing and
[1:33:33] preaching and reading of the word that
[1:33:34] there is more for me than I have today
[1:33:37] and so there's a change spirit inside of
[1:33:41] me there's something inside me that's
[1:33:44] drawing me further even when it's
[1:33:46] uncomfortable even when it's humbling
[1:33:48] even when it requires me to lay down my
[1:33:50] Justified responses to situations and
[1:33:53] people
[1:33:54] because I want what he has rather than
[1:33:56] hold on to what I have what I see is way
[1:33:59] better than where I'm living today as
[1:34:01] good as it might be
[1:34:03] today he's trying to get us listen we
[1:34:06] might be at bad he's trying to get us to
[1:34:07] good we might be at good to get us to
[1:34:09] better we might be at better he's trying
[1:34:10] to get us to best best is resurrection
[1:34:12] and Rapture Church we've all got to get
[1:34:14] to best but wherever you are today say
[1:34:17] Lord I want to be moved on from there to
[1:34:19] the to the next step cuz it's a process
[1:34:22] it's a little bit by little bit
[1:34:24] from glory to glory as we'll read a
[1:34:25] little bit
[1:34:27] later all I can do is read that
[1:34:29] scripture and say Lord let that be my
[1:34:31] testimony every
[1:34:33] week I used to
[1:34:35] be such was I but I've been washed I've
[1:34:39] been Sanctified I've been
[1:34:41] Justified Church don't think that you're
[1:34:43] going to get to a certain point and he's
[1:34:45] not continuing to do this sanctification
[1:34:47] is an ongoing work remember what Jesus
[1:34:50] said to the disciples he said he said
[1:34:53] you know he says you're clean but not
[1:34:55] every bit every day you walk through
[1:34:58] this world you get a little bit dirty he
[1:35:00] says and you need to be washed every day
[1:35:02] that's what sanctification is it's
[1:35:03] washing it's keeping you clean every day
[1:35:07] we see things we hear things we look at
[1:35:09] things we do things we say things we
[1:35:12] think things that are not fit and we
[1:35:14] need a
[1:35:16] cleansing listen don't think that a
[1:35:18] preacher doesn't have the same issues
[1:35:19] you do we are all born in the same flesh
[1:35:22] the only difference between me and you
[1:35:23] is I'm called to preach and you're not
[1:35:26] that's it we all deal with the exact
[1:35:28] same things day by day so there's a
[1:35:30] sanctification that's going on and as
[1:35:32] I've said before the further you go in
[1:35:34] life the more he tightens the reins I
[1:35:36] find because as he gets the major things
[1:35:39] out now he starts to work on the minor
[1:35:41] things and it may not be that I don't
[1:35:42] have to worry about the the the big
[1:35:44] issues but now it's attitudes now it's
[1:35:47] the thoughts now it's the things we let
[1:35:48] to go on in our minds that he's dealing
[1:35:50] with what's he doing he's tearing out
[1:35:52] the strongholds
[1:35:54] so that there can be Liberty there can
[1:35:56] be Liberty inside of us he's he's is is
[1:35:59] very desirous to go into those areas
[1:36:01] that are so built up you know you know
[1:36:04] what scar tissue is the deeper you've
[1:36:07] been wounded the heavier the scar tissue
[1:36:10] and scar tissue is harder and stronger
[1:36:13] and rougher than the flesh that was
[1:36:14] there originally but what he's wanting
[1:36:17] to do is he's wanting to go out and dig
[1:36:18] out that scar flesh and put on the bomb
[1:36:21] of Gilead so that you can have that
[1:36:24] softness again that you had in the
[1:36:25] beginning not toughened up by life but
[1:36:28] softened up by the holy
[1:36:30] spirit cuz remember our original heart
[1:36:32] was hard and he's got to soften that up
[1:36:36] he gives us a new one he softens it up
[1:36:38] that's what he's trying to do in our
[1:36:39] lives I'm here to tell you today your
[1:36:41] excuses won't free you your reasons
[1:36:44] won't free you what'll free you is to
[1:36:47] let him put you into Liberty that's the
[1:36:51] only way it's going to do God doesn't
[1:36:52] start with perfect
[1:36:54] people God starts with nobody's with
[1:36:57] nothings with flawed failed people and
[1:36:59] he turns them he reveals them as Sons
[1:37:02] and Daughters of
[1:37:03] God Paul will continue in 1 Corinthians
[1:37:06] he says for you see your calling
[1:37:08] Brethren how that not many wise men
[1:37:10] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[1:37:12] noble are called but God had chosen the
[1:37:15] foolish things of the world to confound
[1:37:18] the wise and God had chosen the weak
[1:37:20] things of the world to confound the
[1:37:22] things which are mighty and base things
[1:37:25] that word base it means cowards lowborn
[1:37:31] nobodies and basing of the world and
[1:37:34] things which are despised
[1:37:37] contempt everyone looks down on these
[1:37:39] people hath God chosen yay and things
[1:37:42] which are not the nobody's to bring to
[1:37:44] not the things that are we see that
[1:37:46] God's not resting on our natural
[1:37:48] abilities on our natural cleanliness on
[1:37:50] our good genetics or our intelligence or
[1:37:52] gifts or these things
[1:37:53] rather God has chosen us despite those
[1:37:56] things amen that the world those things
[1:37:59] that the world thinks are so essential
[1:38:01] God says watch what I can do with a
[1:38:04] nobody
[1:38:06] amen God has chosen broken failed weak
[1:38:10] people for his open show of Victory the
[1:38:13] church is his victory and it's a bunch
[1:38:15] of nobody's what is that open show of
[1:38:18] Victory Church it's taking what appeared
[1:38:20] to be a slave and revealing it as a son
[1:38:22] and a daughter of God that's God's open
[1:38:25] show of Victory it's taking a nobody and
[1:38:27] showing the world what God can do with a
[1:38:28] nobody that's his open show of Victory
[1:38:31] that's what David that's why it's such
[1:38:32] an amazing story is God took a little
[1:38:34] Shepherd boy and he destroyed the
[1:38:36] greatest champion that the world could
[1:38:38] offer with a tiny little
[1:38:42] weapon that's what God does little
[1:38:45] nobodies knocking down Giants
[1:38:51] amen listen our weaknesses are not not
[1:38:53] an excuse genetic traits are not an
[1:38:55] excuse family traditions are not an
[1:38:57] excuse Church Traditions are not an
[1:38:59] excuse hurts and pains and offenses are
[1:39:01] not an
[1:39:03] excuse listen yes they have an effect
[1:39:07] but watch what Paul's Paul says Paul
[1:39:09] would say in the book of Hebrews
[1:39:10] remember in the in the faith chapter
[1:39:11] Hebrews 11 I think it says out of
[1:39:15] weakness they were made strong these are
[1:39:18] the heroes of the Faith Church and he
[1:39:19] says out of weakness we're made strong
[1:39:21] in other words they weren't originally
[1:39:23] known for what they were later known for
[1:39:26] they weren't known as Brave when they
[1:39:27] started they were known with bra as
[1:39:29] Brave when he finished with them they
[1:39:30] weren't known for courage or wisdom or
[1:39:32] these things but God took those nobodies
[1:39:35] and he put his spirit inside of them and
[1:39:36] he did something with them that they
[1:39:38] could never do in of themselves listen
[1:39:40] Gideon was the lowest of the low
[1:39:43] remember his family was in the lowest
[1:39:45] tribe and his family was the lowest
[1:39:46] family in the lowest tribe and he was
[1:39:48] the lowest person in the lowest Tri
[1:39:50] family in the lowest tribe of all of
[1:39:51] Israel Gideon was the guy at the bottom
[1:39:55] there was nobody lower than
[1:39:57] Gideon he wasn't a warrior he wasn't a
[1:39:59] judge he wasn't even courageous he was
[1:40:01] hiding out in the wine press threshing
[1:40:03] wheat trying to get some food for his
[1:40:06] family but God took that little coward
[1:40:09] and he destroyed I think 120,000
[1:40:12] Soldiers with him and his 299 or 300
[1:40:15] men that's what God does he takes no
[1:40:19] buies they didn't they didn't start out
[1:40:22] strong they became strong out of their
[1:40:25] weakness he didn't start them in perfect
[1:40:27] circumstances he started them in hard
[1:40:30] circumstances he started them in brutal
[1:40:32] circumstances he started them as
[1:40:34] outcasts he started them under
[1:40:36] persecution and out of that put his
[1:40:38] Spirit on them to produce
[1:40:41] Liberty they didn't have what they
[1:40:43] needed his Spirit put in them what they
[1:40:45] needed to have and it did the work that
[1:40:47] they could never do amen those things
[1:40:50] never sto God for a moment
[1:40:54] Gideon's uh cowardice never stopped God
[1:40:58] we were talking about this in the house
[1:40:59] the other
[1:41:01] day Gideon says Okay God and I don't
[1:41:04] remember the order so forgive me God
[1:41:06] when the duw comes in the morning I want
[1:41:09] the the fleece to be dry but I want the
[1:41:11] ground to be
[1:41:12] wet that happens that's a miracle church
[1:41:15] that's not the way fleece works then
[1:41:17] then he says well Lord just to make sure
[1:41:19] this morning the next morning I want the
[1:41:21] fleece to be wet but the ground to be
[1:41:22] dry
[1:41:24] God didn't say come on Gideon I gave you
[1:41:25] one Miracle do you need two
[1:41:28] really and even after that remember
[1:41:30] Gideon he was he was unsure of himself
[1:41:33] so God says listen go down into the into
[1:41:35] the camp and two people that don't know
[1:41:37] who Gideon are are sitting there and one
[1:41:39] of them tells a dream and the other one
[1:41:40] interprets it God gives dreams and
[1:41:43] interpretations to two heathens that
[1:41:45] identifies Gideon as the one that's
[1:41:47] going to destroy the
[1:41:49] Army listen church God will get you
[1:41:52] there God will get you
[1:41:55] there how Supernatural was that Gideon
[1:41:58] had sign after sign and wonder after
[1:42:00] wonder and finally he got to the place
[1:42:02] where he could do what God told him to
[1:42:03] do and God brought the Victory and
[1:42:06] Gideon got all the
[1:42:11] credit that's
[1:42:13] Liberty not looking at the circumstances
[1:42:16] not looking at oursel that's the thing
[1:42:18] that holds us back so many times is
[1:42:19] either looking at the other person or
[1:42:20] looking at oursel and saying I don't got
[1:42:22] what it takes
[1:42:24] that's not what he's trying to do he's
[1:42:26] trying to get us to see him through his
[1:42:28] word I've read this quote before he says
[1:42:31] we try to make our weaknesses excuses we
[1:42:34] want to tell how big we are how great we
[1:42:36] are he says I think that's one of the
[1:42:37] things that God gave me this text for
[1:42:39] was to get that out of our minds see
[1:42:41] there are little things we do these
[1:42:43] little things we ought not to do our
[1:42:44] cracks and our foundations our our
[1:42:46] temper our habits our sour spots our
[1:42:48] trigger points he says and that's what
[1:42:51] we come to church for is to find find
[1:42:53] out where our faults
[1:42:55] are why so we can be set
[1:42:58] free and the things that we might better
[1:43:01] ourselves by if we come to church for
[1:43:03] any other objective than this I'm afraid
[1:43:05] we won't get much out of coming to
[1:43:07] church why because we're coming to hear
[1:43:09] what we want to hear that makes us feel
[1:43:11] good rather than what make us
[1:43:13] good listen we're not going to feel good
[1:43:15] a lot in this Christian walk It's A Hard
[1:43:17] Road It's A Hard Road but you want to
[1:43:20] have rest you want to have assurance
[1:43:23] that what you're doing and where you are
[1:43:24] is the right
[1:43:25] place he says if we come to sorry he
[1:43:28] says we must come in to find our
[1:43:30] weaknesses find our bad places and see
[1:43:33] how little we are and put our trust in
[1:43:36] somebody that's strong that's where the
[1:43:37] Liberty is is not what I am it's what he
[1:43:40] is it's not what I bring to the table
[1:43:42] it's what he's already brought to the
[1:43:44] table he says that's the reason why he
[1:43:47] chooses us because we're in that
[1:43:51] condition listen if you can't do it then
[1:43:53] he doesn't have to worry about you
[1:43:54] trying to do
[1:43:56] it that's what God can use as somebody
[1:43:58] that knows they can't do it he says now
[1:44:01] that sounds strange but just a few
[1:44:02] minutes we'll get to the reason of it if
[1:44:04] God been willing we found out just as
[1:44:06] we've been reading that weaknesses and
[1:44:08] rejections that those people who are the
[1:44:10] weakest and the rejected by the outside
[1:44:12] world are God's Heroes that conquer up
[1:44:15] in the front line it takes those who
[1:44:18] feel themselves
[1:44:20] unworthy see now here's the thing
[1:44:23] he's not wanting you to feel unworthy
[1:44:25] about who you are he's wanting you to
[1:44:27] recognize that your strength is not
[1:44:29] going to get you through that your gifts
[1:44:31] aren't going to get you through your
[1:44:32] intelligence your money your health
[1:44:34] whatever it might be your knowledge your
[1:44:36] understanding that's not what's going to
[1:44:37] get you through what's going to get you
[1:44:38] through is Christ The Living
[1:44:41] Word remember what Jesus said in John 8
[1:44:43] the servant the slave is bound by
[1:44:45] unbelief he's not allowed to stay in the
[1:44:47] father's house all the time he says you
[1:44:49] if you let God set you free that's when
[1:44:52] you can live as a son is meant to live
[1:44:54] as a daughter of God is meant to live
[1:44:56] when he sets you
[1:44:57] free so often the slavery that we're in
[1:45:00] is our own idea that we can do it
[1:45:04] ourselves and what causes us to go out
[1:45:06] is when we
[1:45:08] fail but he say no if you'll stay with
[1:45:11] me then I'll get the job done Paul said
[1:45:13] this in Galatians 4 he says and when the
[1:45:15] fullness of the time was come God sent
[1:45:18] forth his son made of a woman made under
[1:45:20] the law to redeem them that were under
[1:45:22] the law we might receive the adoption of
[1:45:24] sons the placing of sons and because you
[1:45:27] are Sons remember what we said you
[1:45:29] always were a child of God you don't
[1:45:31] become one the outside is shown to be
[1:45:34] what it is and that's not always obvious
[1:45:37] but inside you are always a son or
[1:45:38] daughter of God and because ye are Sons
[1:45:40] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:45:42] into your hearts crying Abba Father
[1:45:45] wherefore Thou
[1:45:46] Art no more a servant see you used to be
[1:45:51] a servant you used to be a slave but
[1:45:53] when you receive his Spirit now you're
[1:45:56] no longer a slave you are a son you are
[1:45:58] a daughter of God he says and if you are
[1:46:01] a son then you are an heir of God
[1:46:04] through
[1:46:06] Christ Paul comes along he says because
[1:46:08] you're a son because you're a child of
[1:46:10] God God sends his holy spirit your way
[1:46:13] and it makes you realize you don't have
[1:46:15] to be a slave
[1:46:16] anymore you don't have to be the way you
[1:46:18] used to be you're not a servant you're a
[1:46:20] Son of God you're a child of God and
[1:46:22] with that comes an
[1:46:24] inheritance with that comes something
[1:46:26] you didn't know you have before amen you
[1:46:28] don't have to stay where you are you
[1:46:30] don't have to stay where you used to be
[1:46:32] you can now step forward into that true
[1:46:34] Liberty that's the inheritance that we
[1:46:36] have yes we have healing in these things
[1:46:38] yes we have a a Blessed Assurance we
[1:46:40] have rest and peace but our true Liberty
[1:46:42] is that we don't have to live the way we
[1:46:44] used to live listen healing comes and
[1:46:47] goes well you get healed today you'll be
[1:46:50] sick tomorrow you'll be sick next month
[1:46:51] you'll be sick next year healing in this
[1:46:53] life is temporary but Liberty in Christ
[1:46:56] is eternal it lasts once you get it you
[1:46:59] have it for the rest of your life amen
[1:47:01] listen to this again A Familiar quote
[1:47:03] I've read it before he says he chose us
[1:47:05] in love before the foundation of the
[1:47:07] world he says now watch having
[1:47:09] predestinated us under the adoption of
[1:47:11] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:47:13] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:47:15] will he says isn't that wonderful he
[1:47:19] loved you he loved you before there was
[1:47:21] a world he knew knew your nature he knew
[1:47:24] your weaknesses he knew your habits he
[1:47:27] knew all about you what you were going
[1:47:29] to
[1:47:31] be and then when he looked all over the
[1:47:34] great universe as it was he said these
[1:47:36] words I Choose
[1:47:41] You I Choose You Lord I've got a temper
[1:47:45] that can fight a buz saww I Choose You
[1:47:48] Lord I've got seems like everything in
[1:47:50] my body is lost I Choose You you Lord it
[1:47:53] seems like I can't trust anybody I
[1:47:56] choose
[1:48:00] you that's the only words that matter I
[1:48:04] choose you and when he did that before
[1:48:08] there was ever a speck of light then
[1:48:10] you're Eternal with God now notice he
[1:48:13] did not choose us to stay in the
[1:48:16] weakness in the habits and in the nature
[1:48:20] that's why he said in Jer or Ezekiel he
[1:48:22] says I'll give you a new heart I'll give
[1:48:23] you a new spirit and then I'll place my
[1:48:25] spirit within you he chose you while you
[1:48:27] had those but he did not choose you to
[1:48:29] stay in those conditions that's a slave
[1:48:32] condition the sunship the daughter ship
[1:48:34] that's what he wants you to come into
[1:48:36] amen church if those things won't stop
[1:48:39] God if those things didn't stop God why
[1:48:42] should they stop me or
[1:48:43] you why should they stop me or you why
[1:48:46] should we have those as an excuse if
[1:48:48] they weren't an excuse for God if God
[1:48:51] looked beyond those things then why
[1:48:53] can't we look Beyond those things if
[1:48:55] they didn't hold God back then why
[1:48:56] should they hold us
[1:48:59] back the Liberty I have this morning is
[1:49:02] that God chose me not that I chose him
[1:49:07] scripture says no man can come to the
[1:49:08] father except God draws
[1:49:11] him he chose me that's my Liberty
[1:49:14] because God doesn't make mistakes God
[1:49:17] doesn't choose and then let go God
[1:49:20] doesn't start and then not finish
[1:49:24] God makes no mistakes and so in choosing
[1:49:27] me he chose perfection in choosing you
[1:49:32] he chose Perfection cuz that's what God
[1:49:34] is God is
[1:49:38] perfection we said earlier that a slave
[1:49:41] chooses to stay a slave based on their
[1:49:44] circumstances what others have done to
[1:49:46] them but as we turn the page a son or
[1:49:48] daughter of God now they choose that
[1:49:51] they don't have to stay
[1:49:53] where they are they choose
[1:49:55] Liberty listen God's not going to force
[1:49:57] you you're going to make a
[1:50:02] choice
[1:50:03] Liberty or to stay
[1:50:06] bound guess what there are people that
[1:50:08] have been bound for 20 30 40 50 years
[1:50:11] there are people I've met church and you
[1:50:13] meet them and you talk to them and
[1:50:15] they've only got one thing they want to
[1:50:17] talk about and it's something that
[1:50:18] happened in the past and you go back a
[1:50:19] year later and they're still talking
[1:50:21] about it and you go back a year later
[1:50:22] and still talking about it why they are
[1:50:24] bound by circumstances they're Bound by
[1:50:27] events they're Bound by the feelings
[1:50:28] that are tied to those events and you
[1:50:31] say my brother my
[1:50:33] sister you don't say it but you think it
[1:50:37] how can this be all that you can talk
[1:50:39] about it's because they're in bondage
[1:50:43] they're in bondage to their
[1:50:46] past Son of God doesn't say I'm in rough
[1:50:50] circumstances God of God doesn't say I
[1:50:53] was born this way what do they say I was
[1:50:57] born to be more than all of these things
[1:50:59] I was B I Was Born to Live above it I
[1:51:01] was born to move past it I was born to
[1:51:04] get the Victory and come into full
[1:51:07] Liberty that's the mindset of a child of
[1:51:09] God take it back to David because David
[1:51:12] I I just I I David is almost
[1:51:14] unfathomable to
[1:51:16] me because he he's chosen out of nowhere
[1:51:20] he's Anointed with the spirit of God and
[1:51:21] almost immediately gets a great Victory
[1:51:23] does everything right and then starts
[1:51:25] scrambling to live for the next 15
[1:51:28] years and and and his the the worship
[1:51:31] and the praise that came out of that but
[1:51:33] also we see the the real thoughts of
[1:51:35] David's heart David had dark moments
[1:51:38] absolutely David had dark moments where
[1:51:41] he's saying God why do the Heathen why
[1:51:44] do they they benefit why do they grow
[1:51:46] Rich why does it seem like they prosper
[1:51:48] and I'm out here struggling just to make
[1:51:49] ends me
[1:51:52] I'm struggling to stay alive and they're
[1:51:54] prospering
[1:51:56] Lord but David had found a place
[1:51:59] remember what David was known for he was
[1:52:00] known for going out and going in and
[1:52:02] coming out David knew how to find the
[1:52:05] will of God then he go do it then he
[1:52:06] come back and he go in and find the will
[1:52:07] of God and then he go do it and David
[1:52:09] had perfect Victory because he could go
[1:52:11] into the presence of God and he could
[1:52:13] find what God wanted to
[1:52:15] do I want to share something a brother
[1:52:17] shared with me yesterday and just
[1:52:20] blessed me I wanted to take it as we
[1:52:21] start to close out this service this
[1:52:23] morning Jesus said the son doesn't have
[1:52:25] to leave the house the slave has to
[1:52:27] leave but the son doesn't amen and this
[1:52:30] that that slave Is Us in the starting
[1:52:33] point in our flesh and these different
[1:52:35] things we're Bound in sin we're Bound in
[1:52:36] reasons we're Bound in excuses in
[1:52:38] circumstances that slave is just a son
[1:52:41] that hasn't been set free yet that's all
[1:52:43] it's the same person all throughout but
[1:52:45] what's going to make that change in our
[1:52:47] lives what is it that's going to do the
[1:52:49] work that we can't seem to do for
[1:52:51] ourselves
[1:52:52] David had this beautiful key in Psalm 23
[1:52:55] very familiar scripture only six
[1:52:58] verses he says the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:53:01] shall not want that's a son's testimony
[1:53:05] I shall not want he maketh me to lie
[1:53:08] down in Green Pastures he leadth me
[1:53:10] beside the Still Waters he restores my
[1:53:13] soul church that means if he's restoring
[1:53:16] it it's because it needs
[1:53:17] restoring we can't sit here and say I
[1:53:20] don't need it we need it we need to have
[1:53:23] a time where we can lay everything down
[1:53:27] have you I've done this a couple times
[1:53:28] in the past few days have you ever just
[1:53:31] in the middle of the day gone in and
[1:53:32] laid down on your bed and let everything
[1:53:35] in your body
[1:53:37] relax
[1:53:40] no when you go do it you just kind
[1:53:44] of and you let the weight off and you
[1:53:47] let your breath out and you just relax
[1:53:49] and you sink into that bed and
[1:53:51] everything's supported
[1:53:53] and you're just at comfort and peace and
[1:53:54] if you lay there for about 3 minutes
[1:53:56] your eyes will start to get heavy cuz
[1:53:58] you're just at such a place of rest what
[1:54:01] is it your body's being restored you're
[1:54:04] working hard you got things on your mind
[1:54:06] you're going you're running to and fro
[1:54:08] all these things and you just lay down
[1:54:09] and you take a break the body needs it
[1:54:13] guess what our soul needs restoration
[1:54:15] sometimes yes that's what church is for
[1:54:18] but listen you can't go to church every
[1:54:19] day you got to have a place of
[1:54:21] restoration a place of recharge a place
[1:54:23] where you can just let things go and
[1:54:25] just rest in his presence he says he
[1:54:28] restores my soul he leadeth me in the
[1:54:31] paths of righteousness for his name's
[1:54:32] sake yay though I walk through the
[1:54:34] valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:54:37] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[1:54:39] rod and thy staff come for me he didn't
[1:54:42] say times weren't hard church he said
[1:54:45] I'll take you
[1:54:46] through you'll never see what promise in
[1:54:48] the scriptures that he would take the
[1:54:50] hard times out of our life what he would
[1:54:52] do has used them for our
[1:54:54] benefit but watch these last two verses
[1:54:56] he says Thou preparest a table before me
[1:55:00] in the presence of mine enemies thou
[1:55:02] anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:55:05] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:55:08] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:55:10] and I will dwell in the house of the
[1:55:13] Lord forever so Jesus says the son
[1:55:17] doesn't have to leave the house David
[1:55:19] gives us a picture of what's happening
[1:55:20] in the house
[1:55:22] he's giving us a clue as to what the
[1:55:24] answer is I want to focus on verse 5
[1:55:26] because if you stop and think about what
[1:55:28] verse 5 looks at it'll help us recognize
[1:55:31] our position as a child of God this is
[1:55:34] the this is the difference between an
[1:55:35] experience as a slave and an experience
[1:55:37] as a son this is the difference between
[1:55:40] truth and religion is verse five here
[1:55:43] what's happening in the house he says
[1:55:44] you're in the presence of the father
[1:55:47] you're at his table he provides for you
[1:55:51] he comforts you he gives you you
[1:55:52] strength he meets your needs he gives
[1:55:54] you Direction he's the source of all you
[1:55:57] need that's what David's saying he's
[1:55:59] saying everything I need he has provided
[1:56:02] that's what's going on in the house but
[1:56:05] I want you to see something but David's
[1:56:08] description in verse 5 is not he takes
[1:56:10] away my hard
[1:56:12] times David says what I'm doing in his
[1:56:15] presence the enemies are still there the
[1:56:17] circumstances are still there the
[1:56:19] hardships are still there if you could
[1:56:21] build a mental picture
[1:56:23] this morning you're sitting down at the
[1:56:25] at the at the table in your home
[1:56:27] wherever that might be and the arrows
[1:56:29] are flying overhead and there's shouts
[1:56:31] and there's chaos and there's bullets
[1:56:33] and there's yelling and there's
[1:56:34] screaming and there's
[1:56:37] distractions but David's still
[1:56:40] eating the circumstances have not moved
[1:56:43] on what's not what's changing here
[1:56:46] Church the circumstances aren't changing
[1:56:48] it's David that's being changed David's
[1:56:51] attitude David's response David's nature
[1:56:53] is being changed as he sits at this
[1:56:55] table because before he would say why do
[1:56:57] the wicked Prosper why did the Heathen
[1:56:59] rage and these different things now he's
[1:57:01] sitting there and he's sitting at the
[1:57:03] table and he's saying you're anointing
[1:57:05] my head with oil you're pouring your
[1:57:06] spirit out on me my cup runs over I've
[1:57:09] got more than I need and the enemies are
[1:57:12] still all around the circumstances are
[1:57:14] still there the hardships are still
[1:57:16] there the persecution still there and
[1:57:18] his testimony is my cup runneth over
[1:57:22] something's changed church and it's not
[1:57:24] the circumstances it's the Son of God in
[1:57:26] the house of God in the presence of the
[1:57:30] father that's what we're looking for not
[1:57:32] change circumstance change
[1:57:38] me what's he eating at the
[1:57:41] table he's eating a word that's been
[1:57:43] prepared just for
[1:57:46] him he's eating a meal that's been
[1:57:49] prepared to meet the needs and the
[1:57:51] challenges of his day it's just for him
[1:57:54] thou prepares the table before
[1:57:57] me in other words he looks at him and he
[1:58:00] brings what he has need of to the
[1:58:03] table I don't know if you know it this
[1:58:05] morning but you're eating a meal that's
[1:58:07] been prepared for
[1:58:09] you it isn't happen stance it is a
[1:58:13] specific diet that God has ordained for
[1:58:15] you this
[1:58:17] morning you're feeding on Christ the
[1:58:19] word and it's building up your awareness
[1:58:21] of who who you are and the unchanging
[1:58:24] position that you hold as a child of God
[1:58:27] regardless of what's going on around
[1:58:32] you was that song we sing Turn Your Eyes
[1:58:35] Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful
[1:58:38] face and the things of this Earth will
[1:58:40] grow strangely
[1:58:43] dim in the light of his glory and grace
[1:58:46] see when you focus on him everything
[1:58:49] just starts to drift
[1:58:51] away and you can have peace in the storm
[1:58:54] you ever noticed that story of of the
[1:58:56] disciples and Jesus in the boat and in
[1:58:58] the storm Jesus is sleeping while
[1:59:00] they're all in a panic why he knows who
[1:59:03] he is the storm doesn't bother him see
[1:59:07] what happens in this is the slave comes
[1:59:09] in and he serves the food he doesn't eat
[1:59:12] the food now maybe the master will throw
[1:59:14] him something maybe he'll give him some
[1:59:17] scraps maybe he'll let him eat the
[1:59:19] leftovers when it's all said and done
[1:59:21] but the the son doesn't do that see the
[1:59:23] son sits down and what's there is for
[1:59:25] the son he's been called by the father
[1:59:28] to the table and the food that's there
[1:59:30] is prepared for them and he eats and he
[1:59:32] eats and he eats until he is fully
[1:59:36] satisfied he does not pick and choose he
[1:59:39] sits there and everything that he takes
[1:59:41] in is for his good every need is
[1:59:44] supplied at the
[1:59:47] table what is the overcoming in this the
[1:59:50] overcoming is to know that the the word
[1:59:52] that you're eating has already overcome
[1:59:54] every circumstance every demon every
[1:59:57] sickness every hurt every pain every
[1:59:59] genetic flaw that you have and that's
[2:00:02] why you're eaing it you're reading the
[2:00:04] overcoming word it's already overcome
[2:00:07] you know that old cedral song that they
[2:00:08] used to sing I've read the back of the
[2:00:10] book and we win church if we would eat
[2:00:13] this if we would read this if we would
[2:00:14] take it in with knowledge that it works
[2:00:16] with an understanding that it is already
[2:00:18] done in the Eternal Eyes Of God I
[2:00:21] believe we walk a little differently day
[2:00:23] by day it's already done the battle's
[2:00:26] over victory's been
[2:00:28] won
[2:00:30] amen if we'd understand that the word
[2:00:32] has already overcome because the word of
[2:00:34] God cannot return to him void the
[2:00:36] scripture says it must do what it was
[2:00:38] sent out to
[2:00:41] do see it's to stay at the table and
[2:00:44] keep eating and keep eating and keep
[2:00:46] eating until you come to a place of
[2:00:48] overcoming you don't have to leave his
[2:00:50] presence that's why I said if our only
[2:00:52] time in the presence of God is in church
[2:00:54] then we are still in a slave mentality
[2:00:56] we've forgotten our position but when
[2:00:58] you walk out these doors his presence is
[2:01:00] supposed to go with you because his word
[2:01:02] goes with you and it feeds you and it
[2:01:04] sustains you day in and day out and day
[2:01:07] in and day out and it reminds you I am a
[2:01:09] child of God that's what's going on that
[2:01:12] son has a different mindset see the son
[2:01:15] was called to the table servants aren't
[2:01:18] called to the table it's the son that's
[2:01:20] called it's the daughter that's called
[2:01:22] The Dinner Bell the text that says
[2:01:23] supper is ready only goes to the
[2:01:26] children come and eat it's ready for you
[2:01:29] what you have need of I prepared a table
[2:01:31] just for you and the point here that
[2:01:34] David's saying is eat no matter
[2:01:37] what see what happens too often is we
[2:01:40] wait until we're in the battle to start
[2:01:43] eating it's like trying to eat healthy
[2:01:46] once you're
[2:01:47] fat it's a lot harder but if you eat
[2:01:51] right all the way up
[2:01:52] it's a little simpler isn't
[2:01:54] it you don't want to have to build
[2:01:57] strength when you need
[2:01:59] strength cuz when the battle's going on
[2:02:01] we don't get to eat so much but if we're
[2:02:04] eating if we're exercising our faith if
[2:02:06] we're feasting on the word of God then
[2:02:07] when the trial comes then guess what
[2:02:09] we've got what we need to face the
[2:02:11] situation but if we're dried out by ease
[2:02:14] of living and
[2:02:16] comfort then we come to the trial and
[2:02:18] all of a sudden we're
[2:02:19] gasping it's like we you know we start
[2:02:21] play hockey in the in the fall and the
[2:02:23] first couple games are brutal because
[2:02:24] you've not been playing hockey so you
[2:02:27] have no wind you have no
[2:02:29] stamina and you're huffing and puffing
[2:02:31] out there but if you keep at it all of a
[2:02:32] sudden by the end of the season you got
[2:02:33] all this you can skate all day seems
[2:02:36] like same thing for a child of God eat
[2:02:39] no matter what when life is good eat
[2:02:42] more CU as brother Joe liked to tell me
[2:02:44] there's a light in the tunnel and it's
[2:02:46] not it's not daylight it's a truck
[2:02:47] coming your way there's a battle coming
[2:02:50] listen you're a child of God there are
[2:02:52] going to be battles and listen it may
[2:02:54] not be with others it may be internal
[2:02:56] but there's a battle coming because
[2:02:57] there's a resurrection and Rapture we've
[2:02:59] got to make and he's got to prepare a
[2:03:00] bride and she's got to be ready for
[2:03:02] these
[2:03:03] things that slave only has temporary
[2:03:06] Victory people that come to church get
[2:03:09] something and then walk away and they
[2:03:10] don't get anything the rest of the week
[2:03:12] they're a
[2:03:13] slave we're not meant to live that way
[2:03:16] we're meant to have Victory every single
[2:03:18] day we're supposed to be eating every
[2:03:20] single day we're supposed to be taking
[2:03:22] in the word amen God put the word in our
[2:03:25] lives to have action to have life
[2:03:28] remember what it said in Revelation 10
[2:03:30] it said the angel said to John eat the
[2:03:33] book eat the book the book is what's
[2:03:36] going to make the difference John if
[2:03:38] you'll take it into your life it'll do
[2:03:39] something that you've never been able to
[2:03:41] do yourself amen we have to take what's
[2:03:43] been prepared whether it's for our
[2:03:45] healing whether it's for admonition
[2:03:47] whether it's for correction
[2:03:48] encouragement strength whatever it is we
[2:03:51] have a need of you give me a need this
[2:03:53] morning I can point you to a scripture
[2:03:54] that'll give you what you need but
[2:03:56] you've got to be feeding on it you got
[2:03:58] to take these things in what what Jesus
[2:04:01] said he says you shall know the truth
[2:04:04] and the truth shall make you free if you
[2:04:07] can't take the truth you can never be
[2:04:10] free remember what Paul was talking
[2:04:12] about Timothy he says they can't handle
[2:04:14] the truth and because they can't handle
[2:04:17] it because they can't accept it they'll
[2:04:19] never be
[2:04:20] free truth is hard
[2:04:23] sometimes but let me tell you what did
[2:04:25] David say he says Thou preparest the
[2:04:27] table before me in the presence of mine
[2:04:29] enemies Church you take what you're
[2:04:31] fighting and you start eating the word
[2:04:33] and see what happens to what you're
[2:04:35] fighting brother Eddie bisc preached on
[2:04:37] this and he says you take that word and
[2:04:40] you put cancer in front of it what
[2:04:42] happens to cancer brother Bob it leaves
[2:04:45] you put your family situation in front
[2:04:47] of it and what happens it's
[2:04:49] resolved you put your health in front of
[2:04:51] and what happens it comes
[2:04:54] back listen it can be finances it can be
[2:04:57] anything you take it and you take the
[2:04:59] word and you eat that part of the word
[2:05:01] that applies to you it'll do its job
[2:05:04] we've seen it we've seen people healed
[2:05:06] of cancer we've seen lives changed we've
[2:05:08] seen families change listen I'm not
[2:05:09] talking out there I'm talking in here in
[2:05:12] here I'm not here to preach a a theology
[2:05:16] this morning I'm here to preach and
[2:05:17] experience you can be changed you're
[2:05:20] meant to be changed
[2:05:22] you're supposed to be changed he wants
[2:05:24] you to be
[2:05:25] changed amen That Word is Alive it has
[2:05:29] power in it it can't return to God
[2:05:31] unfulfilled listen we're in the last of
[2:05:33] the four
[2:05:34] beasts remember there those four beasts
[2:05:37] that surround the The Throne of God the
[2:05:38] presence of God and that last one is an
[2:05:40] eagle let me tell you what is the eagle
[2:05:43] anointing the eagle anointing is to take
[2:05:45] you
[2:05:46] above not to change the circumstances
[2:05:49] Lions change circumstances
[2:05:52] beasts suffer through it the the ox it
[2:05:54] just gives its life for it the man he he
[2:05:57] argues his way through it but the eagle
[2:06:00] flies above it circumstances don't
[2:06:03] change what changes is his
[2:06:06] position that's the liberty of a Son of
[2:06:08] God is it brings you up into Heavenly
[2:06:10] places it shows you where you're allowed
[2:06:12] to live where you're meant to live an
[2:06:14] eagle is not happy down on the ground an
[2:06:17] eagle is Happy up here and it's that
[2:06:19] effortless flying we've seen a bunch of
[2:06:21] Eagles when we went on our our trip out
[2:06:23] west we saw three or four I think
[2:06:24] throughout the time and you see them and
[2:06:26] they're just effortless they just soore
[2:06:29] sore sore and then they might dive down
[2:06:31] grab food go eat it and then they just
[2:06:33] go up and they sore and it's
[2:06:35] effortless that's what the liberty of a
[2:06:37] child of God is secure in the calling of
[2:06:40] God secure in the calling of God that
[2:06:43] all things work for our good amen he'll
[2:06:46] take us through
[2:06:48] these Leo dea's anointing is this you
[2:06:51] have a right to be the way you
[2:06:54] are God's anointing that eagle anointing
[2:06:57] says you have a right to be the way God
[2:07:00] is what a
[2:07:02] difference stay in bondage or go into
[2:07:08] Liberty Isaiah said this he says so
[2:07:11] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[2:07:13] from the West and his glory from the
[2:07:15] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[2:07:17] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[2:07:20] Lord shall lift up a stand standard
[2:07:21] against him has the enemy come in like a
[2:07:25] flood has he pushed into areas of Our
[2:07:27] Lives I say he has this morning
[2:07:29] absolutely he
[2:07:30] has we Face
[2:07:32] sicknesses we Face struggles we Face
[2:07:37] trials he comes in like a flood Isaiah
[2:07:39] says he'll raise up a standard what does
[2:07:41] raising up the standard do it rallies
[2:07:44] the troops it brings in help it brings
[2:07:48] in something to help you do what you
[2:07:49] can't do on your own that's what the
[2:07:51] standard raising is about is to Rally
[2:07:54] everybody to your help it'll bring
[2:07:56] reinforcements to the situation one of
[2:07:58] my favorite quotes I've read this many
[2:08:00] times he says but now when we need it
[2:08:02] the spirit of God raises a standard what
[2:08:04] is it he is pouring in his
[2:08:08] Spirit listen we've got an open word the
[2:08:10] problem's not the word question is how
[2:08:13] much will we let him come
[2:08:15] in he says and then those who are
[2:08:17] resting under the altar of God as the
[2:08:19] scripture says are crying how long Lord
[2:08:21] how long how much longer he says God is
[2:08:23] waiting on me and you the church is
[2:08:26] waiting on me and you it's adoption time
[2:08:28] when God can pour into us his fullness
[2:08:30] the power his resurrection that when the
[2:08:32] church and Christ become so close
[2:08:34] together till Christ becomes visible
[2:08:37] Among Us and raises the dead and we go
[2:08:40] into the Rapture catch that he says
[2:08:42] God's waiting on you and
[2:08:44] me that implies that we have a choice
[2:08:47] here what's that
[2:08:50] choice do do we go with the word or do
[2:08:53] we go with circumstances do we go with
[2:08:55] the word do we go with emotions do we go
[2:08:57] with the word or do we go with what we
[2:08:58] were born
[2:09:00] with whatever it is we have a choice
[2:09:03] take what these five senses tell us take
[2:09:05] what the inner five senses feel and
[2:09:07] experience or we can take the word of
[2:09:09] God and every choice becomes a battle
[2:09:12] every choice becomes a battle because
[2:09:13] Satan's not going to stand there and let
[2:09:15] us stand on the word he's going to fight
[2:09:17] us every single time and so you got to
[2:09:19] say I'm going to go on to Liberty that
[2:09:21] means there's a battle or I'm going to
[2:09:23] stay right where I am and that's the
[2:09:25] easiest thing because it doesn't require
[2:09:26] a battle at
[2:09:27] all it's our choice this
[2:09:31] morning what's God waiting on us to say
[2:09:34] I'm done I'm finished I've had
[2:09:38] enough no
[2:09:40] more I'm ready to move on up I'm ready
[2:09:44] to let go I'm ready to lay
[2:09:47] down I'm ready for the chain breaker
[2:09:53] we've all got areas things that hold us
[2:09:56] things that have held us
[2:09:59] amen and he's here to say I can set you
[2:10:03] free but you've got to ask for
[2:10:08] it remember we read that quote brother
[2:10:11] Braham said that nobody came into the
[2:10:12] presence of Christ with the right
[2:10:14] attitude but what they received that
[2:10:17] they asked for but they had to come into
[2:10:19] His presence and they had to want it
[2:10:22] they had to ask for
[2:10:25] it the challenge today is lay down your
[2:10:28] rights to feel to believe to think to
[2:10:33] react and say I'd rather have the rights
[2:10:35] of a Son of God that gets to walk free
[2:10:38] of a daughter of God that can lay these
[2:10:39] things down and move on as if they were
[2:10:42] never there in the first place
[2:10:45] amen God's waiting on us to say I'm sick
[2:10:48] of being a Slave
[2:10:51] that's it sick and tired of being sick
[2:10:54] and
[2:10:55] tired and I'm ready to just move
[2:10:58] forward in the Liberty he
[2:11:02] offered two scriptures in a
[2:11:05] quote he says now the Lord is that
[2:11:07] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[2:11:10] is there is
[2:11:12] Liberty Liv Liberty is living where we
[2:11:15] ought to not where we just
[2:11:18] are it's where the word says we can live
[2:11:22] he says but we all with open face
[2:11:24] beholding as in a glass as in a mirror
[2:11:26] the glory of the Lord are changed into
[2:11:28] the same
[2:11:30] image this is the working of the spirit
[2:11:32] in our lives as Believers from glory to
[2:11:35] glory even as by the spirit of the Lord
[2:11:38] that word Glory there means change from
[2:11:40] one manifestation into another
[2:11:42] manifestation into another manifestation
[2:11:44] into another manifestation it's a
[2:11:46] progressive revealing of Christ in you
[2:11:49] listen we aren't born as full- born
[2:11:51] Believers were born as babies in Christ
[2:11:54] as we preached on so recently but
[2:11:55] there's a progressive revealing it was
[2:11:59] um we uh you know we you go visit people
[2:12:02] that have babies we went to see Martha's
[2:12:04] Martha and uh Chris's baby there
[2:12:07] Christian and we're looking at him and
[2:12:09] you're trying to find out who he who he
[2:12:11] looks like I'm sorry to say he doesn't
[2:12:14] look like a coffee yet but you be
[2:12:17] surprised what may come out but for now
[2:12:20] as a little baby looks like the penny
[2:12:22] side of the
[2:12:23] family but we'll see what he looks like
[2:12:25] when he's a full- grown man by God's
[2:12:27] grace because what he remember what Paul
[2:12:30] says we do not yet appear but we shall
[2:12:33] be it's the same thing as a daughter of
[2:12:35] God a child of God Son of God doesn't
[2:12:37] always appear what you are but you're
[2:12:40] changed from manifestation of God to
[2:12:42] manifestation of God and all of a sudden
[2:12:43] those the DNA starts to
[2:12:46] show and starts to break through and all
[2:12:48] of a sudden people say hey you're not
[2:12:50] related to the coffees are you yeah
[2:12:51] actually I am my mom's a coffee and what
[2:12:54] we thought would never break through
[2:12:56] comes
[2:12:56] through that's the working of the spirit
[2:12:59] in our
[2:13:00] lives Romans 8 he says because the
[2:13:02] creature itself shall be delivered from
[2:13:06] the bondage of corruption what is the
[2:13:09] bondage of corruption it's this
[2:13:11] flesh and everything that comes with it
[2:13:14] Church your nature your DNA your gifts
[2:13:18] your attributes your faults your
[2:13:19] failures your weaknesses and your
[2:13:23] strengths it's all corrupt he says we'll
[2:13:26] be delivered from that into the Glorious
[2:13:29] Liberty of the children of God what's
[2:13:32] that it's a body change but before that
[2:13:34] there's liberty after Liberty after
[2:13:36] Liberty after liberty before you come
[2:13:38] into the Glorious Liberty of a full body
[2:13:42] change he says and all that come to me
[2:13:46] I'll give them Zoey my own life I will
[2:13:48] give them my own life and they shall
[2:13:50] never perish I'll raise him up in the
[2:13:51] last day in other words he says everyone
[2:13:54] that comes to me I'll wrap him in me
[2:13:58] amen and he'll become a part of me and
[2:14:00] he can no more die than I can die for
[2:14:02] I'm Immortal and can't die and his soul
[2:14:04] is Immortal and can't die and I'll raise
[2:14:06] him up again at the last day he says
[2:14:08] then that just makes us when the old
[2:14:11] trials get hard Church there's are
[2:14:14] trials hard this
[2:14:15] morning he says then it gets us to say
[2:14:19] in me dwelleth the spirit of God
[2:14:21] there's no good thing in here but him
[2:14:23] that's in there I'm not my own I am his
[2:14:27] he says I don't look for the things of
[2:14:29] the world I look for him for my hope is
[2:14:32] built on him someday I shall see him and
[2:14:35] that's all I have longed for what I live
[2:14:38] for is to bring people to him he says
[2:14:40] and I tell you the old shackles begin to
[2:14:43] drop off and you start walking a new
[2:14:48] again
[2:14:53] what are we living
[2:14:56] for
[2:14:58] Comfort
[2:15:00] ease
[2:15:03] justification affirmation
[2:15:06] acceptance money wealth Fame
[2:15:11] Fortune he says I tell you when I live
[2:15:15] for him that's when the old shackles
[2:15:17] start to drop
[2:15:18] off we get our focus on the right thing
[2:15:21] things God's waiting on
[2:15:24] us listen you've got to want your
[2:15:27] healing but you've got to want the
[2:15:29] change that also comes with that healing
[2:15:32] CU remember how God deals with a son or
[2:15:34] daughter as he deals with them
[2:15:37] differently there are no expectations of
[2:15:39] a child of this world children of this
[2:15:41] world can come in and be healed by
[2:15:42] simple Faith but a child of God there's
[2:15:45] often a change that comes with that
[2:15:48] healing there's a change that comes with
[2:15:50] Deliverance because so many times we've
[2:15:52] wrapped something else around that
[2:15:54] situation and he's trying to break that
[2:15:56] situation before he gives us our healing
[2:15:59] before he gives us our deliverance
[2:16:00] before he gives us a change he's saying
[2:16:02] no no no there's a deeper issue here and
[2:16:05] let me deal with that before I give you
[2:16:07] your healing before I give you your
[2:16:10] deliverance before I give you your
[2:16:12] direction God's trying to get us to a
[2:16:14] place where we'll let go of everything
[2:16:16] not just come for what we want but come
[2:16:19] for what he wants of us
[2:16:22] amen see God's not a doting
[2:16:25] grandfather when we went to the to the
[2:16:29] Gales Jensen was kind of looking around
[2:16:32] and he noticed some chocolates so he
[2:16:33] helped himself to a
[2:16:36] chocolate and the wonderful thing about
[2:16:38] The gales is that they love children and
[2:16:40] she said he said I may eat all of these
[2:16:42] and she said well there's more over
[2:16:43] there and there's also more over there
[2:16:46] see doting grandparents I said you keep
[2:16:48] doing this you're going to have
[2:16:49] grandkids more grandkids than you want
[2:16:51] something along those lines the easiest
[2:16:54] way you can make friends with a kid is
[2:16:55] give them what they want God's not here
[2:16:57] to make us friends God's here to make us
[2:16:58] Sons and Daughters see what we come in
[2:17:01] is we come in and we say I want the
[2:17:02] chocolate God says not until you eat
[2:17:04] your chicken and broccoli
[2:17:06] first grandparents say come in and eat
[2:17:09] all the chocolate you want see God's
[2:17:11] trying to remember what what it was at
[2:17:13] James that said I would that you would
[2:17:15] prosper and be in good health even as
[2:17:19] your
[2:17:21] Soul does prosper see God's worried
[2:17:24] about our
[2:17:25] soul everything else comes and goes like
[2:17:28] I said you're we're healed today
[2:17:29] tomorrow we're sick it's temporary but
[2:17:32] the soul is the Eternal part and he
[2:17:33] wants that to be healthy above all
[2:17:37] else but we have to want with that to
[2:17:41] lay down what we have what we're holding
[2:17:44] on to we have to want to step into what
[2:17:46] God has for us listen remember Jacob was
[2:17:48] a
[2:17:48] Shyer until he got
[2:17:51] desperate and then he wrestled with God
[2:17:54] and Jacob came to a place of rest after
[2:17:57] he' wrestled with God and Jacob's Health
[2:18:00] was never the same his hip never
[2:18:01] recovered after he wrestled but Jacob
[2:18:03] had a rest he never had when he was
[2:18:04] fighting all the time cuz he thought he
[2:18:06] had to fight to get whatever he
[2:18:08] needed he had to lay that down so that
[2:18:11] God could call him Israel a prince
[2:18:14] having power with
[2:18:15] God one quote as we close he says there
[2:18:19] is the body of Christ living standing
[2:18:22] redeemed redeemed he says oh my
[2:18:24] justified in his sight why are we
[2:18:26] Justified we are his victory the church
[2:18:29] is his victory we come forth in these
[2:18:31] last days with the Glorious gospel
[2:18:33] showing his victory he died for this
[2:18:36] purpose and we are proof of his
[2:18:40] victory amen when we see him coming down
[2:18:42] and living among the church that's his
[2:18:44] victory it shows that he couldn't keep
[2:18:46] them in the grave and neither can they
[2:18:49] keep us that's right
[2:18:51] amen God bless you let's stand if we
[2:18:53] would the musicians can
[2:18:55] come if you want Victory this morning
[2:18:57] you want Liberty you've got to be able
[2:18:59] to lay down your reasons your excuses
[2:19:02] your justifications your ideas your
[2:19:05] knowledge and just say Lord here I am
[2:19:08] this is
[2:19:09] me I remember when I gave my heart to
[2:19:11] the
[2:19:12] Lord I had a lot of ideas about a lot of
[2:19:15] people but when I finally gave my life
[2:19:18] to him all that I was focused on was me
[2:19:20] and I realized how badly I needed
[2:19:22] him and it didn't matter what other
[2:19:24] people were doing at that point I think
[2:19:27] that's the time when God can come to us
[2:19:28] and move in the greatest way is when we
[2:19:30] say Lord here I
[2:19:31] am I'm not coming
[2:19:34] perfect listen I've been serving the
[2:19:36] lord now
[2:19:38] for 28 years 28 years
[2:19:42] almost still ain't
[2:19:44] perfect still got flaws still got issues
[2:19:47] he's dealing with but I've got to be
[2:19:49] able to come to him and say Lord here I
[2:19:51] am
[2:19:52] again still got issues Lord can we take
[2:19:55] care of one this week this month this
[2:19:58] year some of these are big things some
[2:20:00] of them can take a year to deal with not
[2:20:03] that God can't do it in a moment but see
[2:20:06] there's roots and there's things that
[2:20:08] are tied to that and you start tugging
[2:20:09] on one and there's usually a few other
[2:20:10] things come along with it and we've got
[2:20:13] to be able to say Lord I'm willing to do
[2:20:15] whatever it takes lay down whatever it
[2:20:17] takes humble myself whatever it takes
[2:20:20] let go surrender whatever it takes to
[2:20:23] let you have that and then what do we do
[2:20:26] we step back into our Posta Duty we sayl
[2:20:27] I'm trusting you to take me through you
[2:20:30] I Marvel at Joseph he came to the end of
[2:20:31] all of his trials and what was his
[2:20:33] attitude God was in it David finally
[2:20:36] gets the throne he didn't want it he
[2:20:38] doesn't trying to get it he finally gets
[2:20:40] the throne and what does he do to Saul's
[2:20:42] family he says I'll take care of
[2:20:45] you we look at that woman at the well
[2:20:47] she finally met a man
[2:20:50] that told her the things she needed to
[2:20:52] be told and what did she say she didn't
[2:20:54] run back to those people and say how
[2:20:56] come you guys couldn't have done this
[2:20:58] she ran out and she said come see a man
[2:21:01] come see somebody that can do for you
[2:21:02] what he did for me and I believe with
[2:21:05] all my heart she went on and she got the
[2:21:06] Holy Ghost after the day of Pentecost
[2:21:09] what is it it's a jubilee trumpet it's a
[2:21:12] child of God recognizing hey I'm allowed
[2:21:15] to go
[2:21:16] free I don't have to stay in this
[2:21:18] condition I don't have to stay in this
[2:21:19] hurt I don't have to stay in this
[2:21:20] hardship I can
[2:21:22] rest I can trust I can be
[2:21:26] changed I can have these shackles broken
[2:21:28] this morning
[2:21:30] amen amen let's bow our heads each
[2:21:36] one Heavenly
[2:21:39] Father Lord your word says you've called
[2:21:41] us out of the bondage of
