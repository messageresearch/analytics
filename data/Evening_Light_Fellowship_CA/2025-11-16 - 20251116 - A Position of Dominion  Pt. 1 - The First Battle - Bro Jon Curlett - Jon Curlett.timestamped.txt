[38:06] &gt;&gt; his voice.

[38:18] is our God
[38:21] all will see. How [singing] great,

[38:28] is our God. And he's [music] the name
[38:33] above [singing]
[38:35] all names.
[38:38] You are worthy [music]
[38:40] of our praise. Hallelujah. Yes. Thank
[38:45] you, Lord. My heart will sing. How great
[38:51] thou art. Let's sing it again. [music]
[38:54] And you're the [singing] name above
[38:58] all names.
[39:01] [music]
[39:01] You are [singing] worthy of our praise.
[39:06] [music]
[39:11] How great
[39:14] is our God. Sing it one more time. And
[39:17] you're the name [music and singing]
[39:19] above
[39:21] all names.
[39:24] You are worthy of all praise.
[39:30] And my heart will sing. How great
[39:36] is [singing] our God.
[39:40] How great [music]
[39:43] is our [singing] God.
[39:46] Sing with [music] me. How great
[39:50] is our God.
[39:52] All will see. How great,
[39:57] how great
[39:59] [music]
[39:59] is our God. and sings my soul.
[40:06] Hallelujah.
[40:07] Hallelujah. Thank [music] you, Lord
[40:10] Jesus. Praise your name. Hallelujah.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; How great [music]
[40:17] thou.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; How [music and singing] great thou are.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[40:26] Glory.
[40:28] Since [music]
[40:29] my soul,
[40:33] &gt;&gt; my Savior
[40:35] God [music] to thee,
[40:41] how great thou art, [music]
[40:48] how great thou art. [music]
[40:55] Then [singing] sings my [music] soul,
[41:00] my Savior,
[41:02] come [music] to me.
[41:08] How great thou art. [music]
[41:15] How great thou are.
[41:21] and [music and singing] sings my soul,
[41:26] my [singing] Savior [music]
[41:28] come to thee.
[41:34] How great thou art.
[41:39] [music]
[41:41] How [singing]
[41:42] great thou art. Sing it one more time.
[41:48] It sings [music]
[41:49] my [singing] soul,
[41:52] my Savior
[41:55] God to thee.
[42:01] How great [singing]
[42:02] thou are,
[42:07] how great thou are. [music]
[42:14] and sings my soul, [singing and music]
[42:18] my Savior
[42:21] God [singing] to [music]
[42:23] thee.
[42:27] How great thou art. [music]
[42:33] How great thou are. [music]
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord,
[42:43] we praise your name this morning. Lord,
[42:45] we lift our voices. We lift our hands.
[42:48] Lord, we defy every spirit that comes
[42:51] against us this morning, Lord, that
[42:52] would try and hold back our worship and
[42:54] our praise. Lord, for you are worthy of
[42:56] our praise. You are worthy of the glory
[42:58] and the honor that goes with it,
[43:00] heavenly father. Lord, we're so thankful
[43:03] this morning for your presence. Lord,
[43:05] we're thankful for your blessings. We're
[43:06] thankful for your joy. We're thankful
[43:08] for your peace. Lord, we're thankful,
[43:10] Lord, for a desire in our hearts to come
[43:12] and worship a living God.
[43:15] Lord, we just want to give you this
[43:16] service. Lord, we want to give you your
[43:19] time, Lord. We want to give you the
[43:20] opportunity to speak into our lives,
[43:22] Lord. That you would peer into our
[43:24] souls, Lord. That every door of our
[43:25] hearts would be open this morning, Lord.
[43:28] That you would speak, Lord. Not a man,
[43:30] but the spirit speaking through him,
[43:31] heavenly father. Lord, have mercy and
[43:34] grace on us this morning. Lord, touch us
[43:36] once again. We pray. Lord, we commit it
[43:38] into your hands now, trusting you in all
[43:40] these things. [music] In Jesus Christ's
[43:42] name we ask and pray it. Amen. Amen. God
[43:46] bless you. Turn if you would to Psalm
[43:47] chapter 8 this morning. [snorts]
[43:50] Amen. Certainly enjoyed the song service
[43:52] in there. Wished I could be out here
[43:53] enjoying it, but it was good to hear the
[43:55] worship and the praise. Amen. God bless
[43:58] you each one for coming this morning and
[44:00] putting your shoulder to the wheel.
[44:02] Amen. A few uh a few announcements this
[44:05] morning. Remember, we have communion
[44:06] next Sunday. So, please remember that.
[44:08] Come prepared for that. We've got
[44:11] special meetings coming up the Sunday
[44:12] afterwards, Friday night, Saturday
[44:15] night, and Sunday morning as usual.
[44:17] Then, we'll have a fellowship on Sunday
[44:18] afternoon as well. We've got Brother
[44:20] Bill Puy coming from Dallas. So, we
[44:22] certainly encourage you to come and and
[44:24] participate in those if you can. We want
[44:26] to welcome the Wiffin family here this
[44:28] morning. God bless you. Good to see Jody
[44:30] and Karen with us and the boys. Amen.
[44:32] Always wonderful to have them with us.
[44:34] Good to have brother Matt back with us.
[44:36] Uh I think he's taken the title of great
[44:37] white hunter from me from my first hunt
[44:39] alone. Amen. The Lord granted him two
[44:41] moose up there through uh through a
[44:44] week's worth of hunting. So we're
[44:45] thankful for that. Good to have him back
[44:47] as well. Also remember the Christmas
[44:49] program is now December the 14th, not
[44:51] December 7th. That didn't really matter
[44:53] to anyone else, but allowed Sister Nikki
[44:55] to be a part of that and we certainly
[44:57] appreciate that. So we move that to
[44:58] December 14th as well. Amen. God bless
[45:01] you.
[45:03] Let's uh read Psalm chapter 8 this
[45:05] morning. And it says, 'When I consider
[45:07] thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
[45:09] the moon and the stars which thou hast
[45:11] ordained. What is man that thou art
[45:14] mindful of him and the son of man that
[45:16] thou visitest him? For thou hast made
[45:18] him a little lower than the angels, and
[45:20] hast crowned him with glory and honor.
[45:23] Thou mst him to have dominion over the
[45:25] works of thy hands. Thou hast put all
[45:28] things under his feet. Amen. And God
[45:32] bless you. You can have your seats this
[45:33] morning. And we're starting a new
[45:35] chapter, a new series this morning. And
[45:37] this has been a burden on my heart for a
[45:39] while. I look around and I see what
[45:40] we're facing. I see in particular what
[45:42] our young people are facing these days.
[45:45] And I know what I used to deal with as a
[45:46] young person. And I'm I'm that special
[45:48] generation that came out of a more
[45:50] traditional way of doing things into the
[45:52] more technologically driven way of doing
[45:54] things. And so I kind of have a foot in
[45:55] the past and I have a a foot in the
[45:57] present, so to speak. And I know how
[45:59] hard it was as a young man, as a
[46:01] teenager, even the things that were
[46:02] offered to me, the things that were
[46:03] given to me, the things that were placed
[46:05] in front of me. And yet, I look today at
[46:07] what young people face, and I say,
[46:08] "Lord, how can they make it through? How
[46:10] can they make it through? It's so
[46:12] difficult. It seems unbearable the
[46:14] onslaught that they face from what
[46:15] Satan's trying to present to them. And
[46:17] it's not just the young people that are
[46:18] dealing with it. It's the middle-aged.
[46:20] And guess what? It's the older folks as
[46:21] well." Amen. Satan's working on all of
[46:23] us. And we're facing an enemy with
[46:25] thousands of years of experience. And we
[46:28] have but a few. You know, the best of us
[46:30] might get 70 or 80 out of it, maybe even
[46:32] 90. But he's got thousands of years of
[46:34] experience. He's got devils with
[46:35] thousands of years of experience. And he
[46:37] studied humanity. And it seems so often
[46:39] when we look around this world, there's
[46:41] more on his side than ours. But, you
[46:43] know, we've got to be able to see beyond
[46:44] the the the realm of the scene and the
[46:47] natural. And we've got to be able to see
[46:48] what is the unseen. Because remember
[46:50] when the prophet and his servant were in
[46:52] that city that was surrounded by
[46:54] chariots and horsemen and he said
[46:55] there's more with us than there are with
[46:57] them and he said Lord open his eyes and
[46:59] he saw the hills were surrounded with
[47:01] flaming horses and chariots. Amen. Only
[47:03] a third of the of the angels got kicked
[47:05] out of heaven. There's twothirds that
[47:06] are on our side and there's a whole lot
[47:08] less people that those angels have to
[47:10] cover. So there's more with us than
[47:11] them. But we've got to realize who it is
[47:13] that's with us when we fight these
[47:15] things. But the Satan's trying so hard
[47:17] to get our attention, to bombard us with
[47:20] things, to to get us frustrated, to get
[47:22] us annoyed, to to take away our peace
[47:25] and our joy and our love, and to fill
[47:27] our time and to fill ju just to to to
[47:30] completely overwhelm us. That's what
[47:33] he's trying to do, to get us to break.
[47:34] Amen. And so many times it seems like
[47:36] he's just sapping the life out of us.
[47:38] Anyone ever get to the end of a day, get
[47:40] to the end of a week, and you just feel
[47:41] like there's nothing left to give. Amen.
[47:44] And that's why we need to come to
[47:46] church. Amen. It reminds us who's
[47:48] Sybron. It reminds us who's fighting
[47:49] with us. It reminds us of our position
[47:52] in Christ. But I wanted to open with
[47:54] this scripture today because I want to
[47:56] start with who we are and what our
[47:58] position is. Amen. If we can keep our
[48:00] eyes focused on where God has placed us,
[48:03] what God has made us to do, then that'll
[48:05] set our footsteps properly day by day if
[48:08] we remember what we're built for. Amen.
[48:10] We were made to have dominion over
[48:12] everything that God created. Everything.
[48:18] Everything. Can you say it with me this
[48:20] morning? Everything. Everything that he
[48:24] created. The works of thy hands.
[48:27] Everything that he created. Thou hast
[48:29] put all things under whose feet?
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Yours.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Mine. Amen. That's what we want to talk
[48:36] about. So, I want to take a a new series
[48:38] and I want to call it a position of
[48:40] dominion. Amen. And we're going to be on
[48:42] this a while. It's going to be a real
[48:44] rubber meets the road type of series.
[48:45] I'm going to be getting into the things
[48:47] we face, the battles we face, how Satan
[48:50] comes at us, how we defeat him, how he's
[48:52] already defeated. Amen. How that God
[48:55] works through us, how the Holy Spirit
[48:56] works through us. And so, I want to
[48:58] start with a a subtitle for this first
[49:00] service of the first battle. And if you
[49:03] know me well enough by now, you know
[49:04] where we're going. You know, we always
[49:06] have to start in the book of Genesis
[49:07] because that's the seed chapter. And
[49:09] anything you see in the Bible, it
[49:11] started in Genesis and it's reaped in in
[49:14] Revelation. You see the seed planted in
[49:16] Genesis and you see the full harvest of
[49:17] it in Revelation. And through the
[49:19] middle, yes, we get glimpses and we get
[49:21] we get a view of what's been going on.
[49:23] But in the book of Revelation, that's
[49:24] when the big picture is revealed. That's
[49:26] when we see what was really right, what
[49:27] was really wrong, what was really true,
[49:29] and what was really false as well. And
[49:31] so we go to Genesis 1 and it says, "So
[49:33] God created man in his image. In the
[49:35] image of God created he him. Male and
[49:38] female created he them."
[49:41] He only made them two genders. If
[49:42] anybody's wondering,
[49:46] he said, "And God blessed them, and God
[49:48] said unto them, be fruitful and multiply
[49:51] and replenish the earth and subdue it.
[49:54] subdue it, and have dominion over the
[49:57] fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
[49:59] the air, and over every living thing
[50:02] that moveth upon the earth. So, I want
[50:04] you to see your position. Now, this is
[50:06] the seed. This is the origin. This is
[50:08] the perfect placing of mankind. Is that
[50:11] you are meant to have dominion over
[50:13] everything you see, everything you face
[50:16] on this earth is under your feet.
[50:19] Absolutely. Every part of it. Amen. You
[50:21] are created to rule on earth. You are
[50:23] created to have dominion on earth. You
[50:25] are created to have authority on earth.
[50:27] You are created to control all things on
[50:30] earth. That's the that's the position,
[50:33] church. And this is by creation, not by
[50:35] works. Your created purpose is to have
[50:39] dominion. Amen. Catch that thought.
[50:42] You're created to do this. It's not that
[50:44] you deserved it. It's the way that God
[50:46] made it. But God put a boundary around
[50:49] that dominion. And that dei that
[50:51] boundary was based on relationship to
[50:53] God. And relationship to God was based
[50:56] on obedience to the word of God. So the
[50:58] boundary of dominion is found by the
[51:01] word of God. Remember we preached on
[51:02] this recently on our Wednesday night
[51:04] service that there were three things
[51:05] that mankind had at the beginning. They
[51:08] had dominion. They had eternal life. And
[51:10] they had relationship with God. And the
[51:13] dominion and eternal life were
[51:14] conditional on relationship with God
[51:17] which was found through the word of God.
[51:19] Amen. All of it came back to the word of
[51:21] God. Without access to God, with the a
[51:24] failure to obey the word, they would
[51:26] lose access to God. They'd lose eternal
[51:28] life and they'd lose their dominion. So,
[51:30] watch what God said. Watch the
[51:31] boundaries God puts on it. He says, "And
[51:33] the Lord God took the man and put him
[51:35] into the garden of Eden to dress it and
[51:37] to keep it. And the Lord God commanded
[51:39] the man, saying, of every tree of the
[51:40] garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of
[51:42] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[51:44] evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in
[51:47] the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
[51:50] shalt surely die. God gives them total
[51:53] liberty to do whatever they want except
[51:58] one thing. There's only one exception.
[52:01] God says you can do whatever you want.
[52:03] Whatever is in your heart, do it except
[52:05] for one thing. Amen. Church, the
[52:07] principle is this. The word is the key
[52:10] to your dominion. The word is the key to
[52:13] your dominion. They'll rule and reign.
[52:15] They'll have dominion as long as they
[52:17] don't do what he said. As long as they
[52:20] do what he said in verse 17, don't eat
[52:22] the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[52:25] Amen. So their power does not come from
[52:27] themselves. Their power comes from the
[52:29] word. I want you to catch that today.
[52:31] Amen. Your power is not of yourself.
[52:33] That means your dominion is not of
[52:35] yourself. Your overcoming is not of
[52:37] yourself. But it comes through obedience
[52:40] to the word of God. Your power is in the
[52:42] word of God because God is not backing
[52:44] you up. God is backing his word up. I
[52:48] don't know if anybody's noticed
[52:49] recently, we're fickle. We change. We
[52:52] have our ups. We have our downs. We have
[52:53] our ins. We have our outs. We have our
[52:55] days of great joy. And then the next
[52:56] day, we're in depression.
[52:59] We are not stable. But the word of God
[53:02] is unchanging. And when we take the word
[53:04] of God into our hearts, put it upon our
[53:07] lips, that's what God is backing up is
[53:09] his word. because his word is the thing
[53:11] that does not change. He doesn't change.
[53:14] His word doesn't change. Amen. And it's
[53:16] because we're in obedience to the word
[53:18] that God backs us up. Amen. The word of
[53:21] God is what upheld Adam and Eve and kept
[53:24] them in dominion. But we saw as we
[53:26] preached on Wednesday night in our other
[53:28] series, what is the result of the
[53:29] disobedience to the word? Death. It's
[53:33] always death. And it's not just natural
[53:35] death. It's not loss of life. But we saw
[53:37] that death is separation from God. And
[53:40] we see that's what happened. He said,
[53:41] "The day you eat thereof is the day
[53:43] you'll die." And that day they did not
[53:45] lose breath, but they were separated
[53:46] from God. They were separated from the
[53:48] tree of life. That was Christ. They no
[53:51] longer had relationship with him. They
[53:53] no longer had access by their own uh
[53:55] request or by their own needs. But it
[53:57] would only be by his sovereign will that
[53:59] he would do it. Amen. God said, "The day
[54:01] you do something contrary to my word,
[54:04] that's the day you're separated from
[54:06] me." And that's exactly what happened.
[54:08] Amen. And it took the perfect sacrifice
[54:10] of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary
[54:12] to pay those sins so that we could have
[54:15] instant access back to God. And we
[54:17] preached on that. He opened up the veil
[54:18] to the Holy of Holies where his shikina
[54:20] glory dwelt. And he was showing the way
[54:23] back is open. The way to fellowship with
[54:25] God is back open. Now, we've preached on
[54:27] the original sin. We're not going to do
[54:29] that this morning. so much. And we're
[54:31] not talking so much about what happened
[54:33] this morning, but how it happened. And
[54:35] the reason for that is because the when
[54:38] it comes to preaching about the trials
[54:39] that we face and the battles we face, I
[54:41] can't fathom everything you're going to
[54:43] face. I can't predict. I can't prepare
[54:45] you for everything on a specific basis
[54:48] that you're going to face. But if I can
[54:50] show you how Satan works and I can show
[54:52] you how God works, you'll learn to
[54:53] discern which is which. and you'll learn
[54:55] how to respond when you're facing a
[54:57] battle, when you're facing a a
[54:59] circumstance in your life. Amen. So, we
[55:01] want to reveal what Satan does and we
[55:03] want to reveal what God does and it'll
[55:05] give us overcoming power if we can do
[55:07] that. Now, we look at this first battle
[55:09] in Genesis 3 and the scripture says,
[55:12] "Now the serpent was more subtle than
[55:14] any beast of the field which the Lord
[55:16] God had made. And he said unto the
[55:17] woman, yay hath God said, ye shall not
[55:20] eat of every tree of the garden." We're
[55:22] going to be preaching a lot on
[55:24] overcoming and how do I overcome in this
[55:26] series, but I want to start out with
[55:28] this thought of recognizing our enemy
[55:30] and his tactics.
[55:32] Amen. Recognizing our enemy and his
[55:34] tactics. The scripture says that the
[55:36] serpent was more subtle. That word means
[55:39] he was more cunning, more crafty, more
[55:41] shrewd than any creature. He could
[55:43] speak. He could hold a conversation. And
[55:45] remember, he wasn't in the form of a
[55:47] snake like we see today. That's his
[55:50] cursed form. But in his original form,
[55:52] he was upright like a man. He could
[55:54] talk. He could reason. He was beautiful
[55:56] to look at. We see the beauty today. The
[55:58] beauty carried over, but the form got
[56:00] lost. They keep looking for the missing
[56:03] link between animal and human. The
[56:05] serpent's it. And you can't find it
[56:06] because God changed him in a moment.
[56:08] That's why they can't find it is because
[56:10] it's no longer there. But Satan in or
[56:13] this serpent was was so appealing to the
[56:16] natural senses in every way. He said the
[56:18] right part thing. He looked the the
[56:20] right part. His He he he he appealed to
[56:23] the outer five senses very well. He
[56:25] appealed to the inner five senses very
[56:27] well. Amen. He was a a whole service
[56:30] being. He could attract every part of
[56:32] your natural body. Amen. And even this
[56:36] church, he was religious.
[56:39] He liked to talk about the word of God.
[56:42] Amen. But he's subtle. And the point
[56:44] that I'm making here is that Satan is
[56:47] not obvious.
[56:50] He's not obvious. And the thing is, when
[56:53] you're well taught by the word, he can't
[56:55] approach you with the obvious. You would
[56:57] think he can't do it because we'll
[57:00] notice that. But if he can do something
[57:02] subtly, that's just a little bit off. If
[57:04] he can get us to move just a little bit
[57:06] off, that's all he's looking because a
[57:08] foot off today is a mile off next year.
[57:11] All he's looking is for one footstep a
[57:13] day. An inch a day will add up over the
[57:15] course of time. But what Satan does is
[57:18] always done in shadows. He's trying to
[57:21] hide the real effect. So he's never
[57:24] going to give you that upfront. Amen.
[57:25] And so Satan's not easy to pin down.
[57:28] It's not easy for us to say about a
[57:30] person or situation. Well, that's Satan.
[57:32] Or there's something wrong here. There's
[57:33] something wrong there. But we've got to
[57:35] be able to sit back sometimes and just
[57:37] say, Lord, let's wait on you. Judge all
[57:40] things. Amen. Give it time. We don't
[57:42] have to be in a hurry about everything.
[57:44] But Satan doesn't generally be he isn't
[57:46] generally blatant with believers because
[57:48] it doesn't tend to work. But what he
[57:50] tries to do is get you to have a
[57:53] conversation.
[57:54] He wants to get you responding to his
[57:57] questions, to his comments rather than
[58:00] feeding the word. He doesn't want you
[58:02] saying the word. He wants you to get to
[58:04] think about it. He wants to get into
[58:06] your head. He tries to get you to
[58:08] consider something for a while. That's
[58:10] all he wants you to do. In short, he's
[58:12] trying to get you to doubt an absolute
[58:15] so that he can get you onto something
[58:17] else. Paul would say it like this. He
[58:20] says, "Lest Satan should get an
[58:22] advantage of us, for we are not ignorant
[58:25] of his devices." The Common English
[58:28] Bible says it this way. He says, "This
[58:29] is so that we won't be taken advantage
[58:32] of by Satan because we are well aware of
[58:36] his schemes." The purpose of this series
[58:38] is to reveal how Satan works and to show
[58:41] us how we can fight against him. Now
[58:43] listen to this quote. He says, "Overcome
[58:45] means to recognize the devil in every
[58:49] one of his tricks."
[58:52] He says, "A lot of people say there is
[58:54] no devil. It's just the thought." Do you
[58:56] catch what he's saying right there?
[58:58] Because people say, "Well, I just had a
[58:59] thought and it wasn't good, but it was
[59:01] just the thought.
[59:04] That's just something in my head." He's
[59:05] saying, "No, that's not a thought.
[59:07] That's Satan trying to talk to you.
[59:10] That's cha Satan trying to plant a seed
[59:12] in your head. That's Satan trying to
[59:15] lodge something that will stick and
[59:17] cause doubt."
[59:19] Okay? People think, "No, I developed
[59:22] that thought. I created that." Church,
[59:24] if you've been a Christian long enough,
[59:26] you know you can be sitting there doing
[59:28] nothing but good and a bad thought will
[59:30] come into your mind
[59:33] out of the blue.
[59:35] You can be focused on the right thing,
[59:37] doing the right thing, and the wrong
[59:39] thought will drop in. Church, we do not
[59:41] create thoughts, we receive thoughts.
[59:42] There's two spheres of influence.
[59:44] There's God, and there's Satan, and
[59:46] they're both trying to press in. And
[59:47] when God's trying to do something, we'll
[59:49] see this in a moment. Satan's always
[59:51] trying to dump something else in your
[59:52] mind. He's always trying to get in
[59:54] there. We are not. We are receptors.
[59:58] We think we're creators. We're not.
[1:00:00] We're receptors for these things.
[1:00:03] He says, "That's not there is no devil.
[1:00:05] It's just a thought." He says, "Don't
[1:00:07] you believe it? There's a real devil.
[1:00:08] He's just as real as you are are or
[1:00:11] anybody, a real devil, and you must
[1:00:14] recognize him real. You must know that
[1:00:16] he's a devil." Now, we saw we saw what
[1:00:18] Paul said that we're not ignorant of
[1:00:20] Satan's schemes and tricks and methods.
[1:00:22] And we shouldn't be. But sometimes we go
[1:00:25] along with them because we think we're
[1:00:27] more than a match. We think because we
[1:00:30] see where he's trying to take us and we
[1:00:32] know he's trying to take us there. We
[1:00:34] can go a little ways and not go all the
[1:00:36] way. We can do something without being
[1:00:40] the way everybody else always goes. He
[1:00:42] won't get me the way he's gotten
[1:00:44] everybody else. I can control it is what
[1:00:46] we say. I know this probably isn't in my
[1:00:49] best interest. I know this isn't really
[1:00:51] according to the word of God, but
[1:00:52] because I know upfront that I'm not
[1:00:55] supposed to do it or it's not good for
[1:00:57] me, I'm going to keep it in moderation.
[1:00:59] Church, we're going to see this as we go
[1:01:01] through this series. We're going to see
[1:01:02] it from people in the Bible. And if it
[1:01:04] happens to them, it happens to us. That
[1:01:06] sin will take you further than you ever
[1:01:08] meant to go. And knowing upfront that it
[1:01:10] is sin does not make it right. It
[1:01:13] doesn't make it controllable. And it
[1:01:15] doesn't give you overcoming power to
[1:01:17] know what it is.
[1:01:18] That's just the first step to recognize
[1:01:21] it upfront. Okay? Amen. A move away from
[1:01:23] the word of God is still a move away
[1:01:25] from the word of God whether you
[1:01:26] recognize it or not. And recognizing it
[1:01:29] doesn't change what it is. But you
[1:01:31] overcome when you refuse him upfront.
[1:01:34] You overcome when you walk away up front
[1:01:36] knowing what's going to happen and going
[1:01:38] along with it anyways. That's insanity.
[1:01:41] That's delusion, church. That's not the
[1:01:43] way that God works. And somehow we do
[1:01:45] that. Amen. And thinking that you're not
[1:01:48] going to go as far as somebody else is a
[1:01:49] root of pride in you. It's a delusion of
[1:01:53] your own power. And Satan dwells in
[1:01:56] pride. And we'll see that as we go. That
[1:01:59] people that thought they were something
[1:02:00] and they played with fire and they got
[1:02:02] judged by it. They got burnt by it.
[1:02:04] Somebody paid a price because they
[1:02:06] thought they could handle it. So he says
[1:02:08] you got to know he's a devil. But he
[1:02:10] says then the same time that you
[1:02:12] recognize him and know he's a devil and
[1:02:14] he's against you then to overcome you
[1:02:17] must recognize that the God that is
[1:02:20] where
[1:02:21] in you
[1:02:23] in you has he says is greater and
[1:02:27] mightier than he is that the one that's
[1:02:30] in you has what already overcome him.
[1:02:34] You say, you know, I I opened up with
[1:02:36] we're facing such an onslaught. We're
[1:02:38] facing such uh struggles in our lives.
[1:02:40] Our young people are completely
[1:02:42] overwhelmed. And and we say, who can
[1:02:45] defeat him? He's already defeated. But
[1:02:49] the source of power to defeat him has to
[1:02:51] be a God that's inside of you, not a God
[1:02:53] that's outside. Not mama's dad, not
[1:02:55] dad's dad. He's got to be my God
[1:02:57] dwelling inside of me because he's the
[1:03:00] mighty conqueror. I'm not the mighty
[1:03:02] conqueror. He's the mighty conqueror.
[1:03:04] And we're facing a defeated foe. And all
[1:03:06] we got to do is recognize our position
[1:03:09] and recognize that the God that's
[1:03:10] greater in us is greater and mightier
[1:03:12] than he is. That the one that's in you
[1:03:14] has already overcome him. Amen. He says,
[1:03:18] "And by his grace, not by wisdom, not by
[1:03:22] discipline, not by teaching, not by
[1:03:25] self-will, by his grace, you who? You
[1:03:30] are more than a match for him." Amen.
[1:03:33] That's real overcoming. When who
[1:03:35] recognizes? When you recognize, you've
[1:03:38] got to recognize that you have overcome
[1:03:41] because greater is he that's in me than
[1:03:43] he that's in the world. I can do all
[1:03:45] things through Christ which strengthens
[1:03:48] me. That's when you realize I can win
[1:03:51] because I've got God inside of me.
[1:03:53] That's the only way you can win. A
[1:03:56] change of mind won't do it. It's a
[1:03:58] start. He does that. A change of heart
[1:04:00] won't do it. Change of mind, that's all
[1:04:01] good. change of spirit. That's great.
[1:04:03] But there's got to be something on the
[1:04:04] inside. There's got to be a new birth
[1:04:06] that has to happen there. This is the
[1:04:08] whole intention of this series is to
[1:04:10] sharpen your discernment so you see
[1:04:13] Satan up front for what he is. Amen. So
[1:04:18] that you can recognize him up front
[1:04:20] rather than halfway down the path he's
[1:04:23] led you. Amen. How many wants to
[1:04:25] recognize him up front? I don't want to
[1:04:27] walk down any roads that he's leading
[1:04:29] me. I want to recognize him upfront.
[1:04:31] Amen. The goal is not to battle him. The
[1:04:34] goal is to refuse him.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; The more you fight, the more he wins.
[1:04:39] But to refuse him. To refuse him. Resist
[1:04:42] and walk away. That's the tactic of the
[1:04:45] believer. Amen. We see Jesus did it. And
[1:04:47] that's our goal for it as well. But
[1:04:48] remember, Satan is subtle.
[1:04:51] He's not going to be obvious. Satan will
[1:04:53] play the long game. Okay? Satan is
[1:04:57] patient with his tactics.
[1:05:00] He's always looking for that perfect
[1:05:02] opportunity and he'll look for it.
[1:05:04] You'll watch it in hockey or any sport
[1:05:07] really. The best players, they're just
[1:05:09] playing for that one mistake. That's all
[1:05:12] they do. And I know these brothers that
[1:05:14] have played sports, all you do, you make
[1:05:16] one mistake and the good players will
[1:05:18] score on you every time. They'll make
[1:05:19] you pay for it, won't they? They're just
[1:05:21] looking for a mistake and they're only
[1:05:23] playing for your mistakes. Satan's the
[1:05:26] same way. He's looking for the day when
[1:05:28] you're down. He's looking for the day
[1:05:30] when you're tired. He's looking for the
[1:05:32] day when you got no more to give. He's
[1:05:34] looking for the day when you've got a
[1:05:36] hunger. And he'll wait for that day and
[1:05:39] then he'll give you the opportunity.
[1:05:41] He's very patient. We know that this
[1:05:44] this thing with Eve did not happen
[1:05:45] overnight. This was not a 30-se
[1:05:48] secondond conversation.
[1:05:49] This was over days and weeks and months
[1:05:52] and maybe years.
[1:05:54] The scriptur is not going to detail
[1:05:55] every conversation they had, but it
[1:05:57] culminated in this one. Okay?
[1:06:00] But I think the idea of of Satan putting
[1:06:03] bait on a hook is a good analogy because
[1:06:05] he waits till you desire something, till
[1:06:08] you've got a hunger for something and
[1:06:10] then he slips you what? Bait big enough
[1:06:13] to cover the hook that ties you to him
[1:06:15] for a season. That takes you down a pad.
[1:06:17] Takes you to someplace that you don't
[1:06:19] want to go.
[1:06:21] Now, watch what this woman says. He
[1:06:23] says, "Has God said you can't eat you
[1:06:25] can eat of all the trees?" She says,
[1:06:27] "The woman said unto the serpent, we may
[1:06:29] eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[1:06:30] garden, but of the fruit of the tree
[1:06:32] which is in the midst of the garden, God
[1:06:34] has said, Ye shall not eat of it,
[1:06:36] neither shall ye touch it, lest she
[1:06:38] die." So, is Eve's doctrine sound?
[1:06:42] Yes, she's saying exactly what God said.
[1:06:44] She's standing on the word. She's
[1:06:46] repeating what God said. Is she secure
[1:06:48] in her knowledge of the word?
[1:06:50] Absolutely. She's saying what God said,
[1:06:53] church. That's the starting place. Say
[1:06:54] what God said. She's done nothing wrong
[1:06:57] here in and of itself. Now, I'd argue
[1:07:01] she has a problem cuz she's having a
[1:07:02] conversation with something under her
[1:07:04] dominion. We preached on that before,
[1:07:06] but let's leave that aside. We're going
[1:07:08] to have conversations,
[1:07:10] but let's watch what happens. It says,
[1:07:13] "And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye
[1:07:16] shall not surely die." What did God say?
[1:07:19] you shall surely die. He said, "You
[1:07:22] shall not surely die." But he didn't
[1:07:24] stop there.
[1:07:27] He never stops there. He has
[1:07:29] contradicted the word. But watch what he
[1:07:31] does now. He says, "For God do know that
[1:07:34] in the day that you eat thereof, then
[1:07:36] your eyes shall be opened and you shall
[1:07:38] be as gods, knowing good and evil." So
[1:07:40] here's the bait. The hook is you shall
[1:07:42] not surely die. the bait that he said.
[1:07:45] Well, one, that's part of the bait, but
[1:07:46] he's he's contradicting the word, but he
[1:07:48] doesn't stop at contradicting, but
[1:07:50] rather he gives a reason for the
[1:07:52] contradiction, and he says, "You won't
[1:07:54] die. God's just guarding his own
[1:07:57] superior position and trying to keep you
[1:08:00] from being just like him.
[1:08:04] He knows things you don't know. He
[1:08:06] experiences things you don't know. And
[1:08:08] he wants it all for himself." And God's
[1:08:11] just trying to bluff you with his word
[1:08:14] to keep you from going to a level that
[1:08:17] he's at.
[1:08:20] So the bait is be like God. And it's
[1:08:23] based on the premise that the word of
[1:08:24] God is a lie, church. But you see what
[1:08:26] Satan's done here? He's made God out to
[1:08:29] be what he is.
[1:08:31] He's telling her, God is what Satan
[1:08:34] really is. But he's presenting himself
[1:08:37] as the good guy, as the the guy that's
[1:08:39] going to set her free, the guy that's
[1:08:40] going to level her up. He's presenting
[1:08:42] himself he's presenting her with great
[1:08:44] enlightenment enlightenment. And he's
[1:08:47] saying God's trying to limit you and I'm
[1:08:50] trying to raise you up. And what he
[1:08:52] doesn't say is God has already placed
[1:08:54] you as high as you need to be in a
[1:08:57] perfect place of blessing.
[1:09:00] And if you do it my way, you're going to
[1:09:01] fall.
[1:09:05] Satan's trying to offer her a higher
[1:09:08] place or give her more by going against
[1:09:11] the word. And he puts God as the bad
[1:09:14] guy. And he paints himself as the good
[1:09:16] guy.
[1:09:18] And it's based on an inner desire within
[1:09:20] Eve for more. See, he's seen a desire.
[1:09:24] He's seen a hunger there. And he's
[1:09:25] starting to feed that. Amen. You'll see
[1:09:27] that Satan's seduction appeals to me.
[1:09:31] It elevates me.
[1:09:33] It's fun for me. It's good for me. It
[1:09:36] benefits me, but the kingdom of God is
[1:09:39] not addressed. And God is certainly not
[1:09:42] addressed. Satan's feeding on what do
[1:09:44] you want? What will make you feel
[1:09:47] better? What will make you greater? It's
[1:09:49] the Mi monster all over again. Satan
[1:09:51] feeds the Mi monster. Listen to this. He
[1:09:54] says, "The prince of the power of the
[1:09:56] air, Satan, is always near to try to get
[1:09:58] something fumbled up in your mind.
[1:10:02] He's trying to get you to think about
[1:10:03] it. He's trying to reason with you. He's
[1:10:05] trying to get you to dwell on it. He's
[1:10:07] bombarding you with these things so that
[1:10:08] you'll get jumbled up so that you can't
[1:10:12] put it straight.
[1:10:14] So you can't determine what's right and
[1:10:15] what's wrong, what's up and what's down,
[1:10:17] what's black and what's white. He's
[1:10:18] trying to blend it so everything is
[1:10:20] gray,
[1:10:22] everything is allowable,
[1:10:24] everything is right, everything is good.
[1:10:27] We're going to preach on mind battles,
[1:10:29] which is the greatest battle that we
[1:10:30] fight. But I want you to see here that
[1:10:32] Eve has a choice to make.
[1:10:35] That's all this is, church. It's a
[1:10:37] choice. And for the believer, there's
[1:10:40] only two choices. There's a right one
[1:10:42] and there's a wrong one. I don't care
[1:10:44] what your situation is. There are never
[1:10:46] two right choices and there are never
[1:10:48] all wrong choice. Some are always wrong.
[1:10:50] Sometimes it's the wrong question being
[1:10:52] asked. And that's why we don't answer
[1:10:54] Satan according to his questions.
[1:10:56] Sometimes he gives us a question that
[1:10:57] you can't answer, right? And that's when
[1:10:59] you walk away. But watch this. We have
[1:11:01] two ways that we can respond. The first
[1:11:04] choice, stay there. Keep talking. See
[1:11:06] where it goes.
[1:11:08] That's the first choice. Continue the
[1:11:10] conversation. Dig deeper. Try to
[1:11:12] understand to make a rational decision.
[1:11:14] In other words, encourage doubt in the
[1:11:17] word of God. And the second choice is
[1:11:20] this. Repeat the word and walk away.
[1:11:23] That's it. You can continue the
[1:11:25] conversation or you can end the
[1:11:26] conversation.
[1:11:28] And if you repeat the word and walk
[1:11:29] away, what do you do, church? You
[1:11:31] enforce faith. You encourage faith. So
[1:11:34] you can encourage doubt in the word or
[1:11:36] you can apply and encourage faith in the
[1:11:38] word. There's no other choice. It's
[1:11:40] either doubt the word or believe the
[1:11:42] word. And if you stay and try to listen
[1:11:44] to something contrary to the word,
[1:11:46] eventually you will turn that staying
[1:11:48] and listening into acting contrary to
[1:11:50] the word. Because you are what you eat.
[1:11:53] You listen to something contrary to the
[1:11:55] word, it'll turn you against the word.
[1:11:57] in that area. Amen. But if you repeat
[1:11:59] the word and walk away, what does it do?
[1:12:01] It establishes your foundation and it
[1:12:03] builds you higher up in your faith.
[1:12:05] Amen. And you don't waste your time
[1:12:06] fighting a battle you're not supposed to
[1:12:08] fight. The idea is to always keep the
[1:12:10] word in front of you. Always keep the
[1:12:13] word in front of you. Watch this. He
[1:12:15] says, "Don't you realize that Eve was
[1:12:17] seeking new life when new light when the
[1:12:19] devil talked to her and it caused every
[1:12:21] graveyard to be out here? caused every
[1:12:23] insane institution, every penal farm,
[1:12:26] caused every death, every soul, every
[1:12:28] starving baby, every dying mother. She
[1:12:30] was searching for something new. She was
[1:12:33] looking for something she could do and
[1:12:36] find new.
[1:12:38] Church, can I say it this way? Stick
[1:12:40] with what has been proven to work.
[1:12:44] Eve was perfectly satisfied
[1:12:48] until Satan came and started talking to
[1:12:50] her.
[1:12:51] She was happy. She was at peace. She was
[1:12:53] at rest. But somebody comes and tries to
[1:12:55] paint a better picture. What does it do?
[1:12:58] It can ignite a desire that was never
[1:13:00] there before. Why? Because you listen to
[1:13:02] it. Because you listen to it. I was
[1:13:05] talking with someone this week and and
[1:13:06] they were saying, "We always want to try
[1:13:08] to find something different that works
[1:13:10] for us. We want to find something that's
[1:13:13] special to us.
[1:13:16] We want to find something that's easier
[1:13:18] for us, something that appeals to us.
[1:13:21] And we never want to do what works. And
[1:13:24] that's the human nature. That's the
[1:13:26] human nature. Amen. We don't want to do
[1:13:28] the hard work of just doing what is
[1:13:30] proven to work. We want to do it some
[1:13:33] other way. There are no shortcuts
[1:13:35] without consequences.
[1:13:37] That's what Satan offered Jesus. Short
[1:13:39] shortcuts supposedly without
[1:13:42] consequence. In fact, skip the
[1:13:43] consequences and go straight to reward.
[1:13:46] Well, see, that's what Satan does. You
[1:13:48] know, if it's health related, you want
[1:13:50] to be healthy, church. There's only
[1:13:51] three things you really need to do. Eat
[1:13:53] healthy in moderation,
[1:13:56] exercise semi-regularly, and get a good
[1:13:59] night's sleep. That's generally it.
[1:14:02] Stress plays in there as well. That's a
[1:14:03] big part of it. But if you want to be
[1:14:05] healthy, eat healthy in moderation,
[1:14:07] exercise in moderation, and get a good
[1:14:09] night's rest. But what do people do?
[1:14:11] They go on extreme diets. They go on
[1:14:14] extreme health diets.
[1:14:17] They go on no food diets. They go on all
[1:14:19] liquid diets. And what happens is
[1:14:21] inevitably they fall off the wagon
[1:14:23] before they complete the journey or
[1:14:25] they're sick cuz the body's not meant to
[1:14:28] live that way. God didn't put us here to
[1:14:31] hold us back from everything. But in
[1:14:32] moderation, our health is. I know a
[1:14:35] brother that got lap band surgery on his
[1:14:37] stomach. Do you know what that is? They
[1:14:38] take the stomach and they put uh they
[1:14:40] they basically cinch it down like it's a
[1:14:42] little tiny balloon and all you it's the
[1:14:44] size of your fist when they're done.
[1:14:46] That's as much food as you can have. Not
[1:14:47] even that big. He was over 300 lb. And
[1:14:50] you know what? For a while he lost
[1:14:52] weight. But what happened was he wasn't
[1:14:55] changed. Only his stomach was changed.
[1:14:57] And eventually he just kept eating and
[1:14:58] eating and eating and he lost some
[1:15:00] weight. And then he went back and he's
[1:15:01] bigger than ever now. Why? Because he
[1:15:03] didn't do the harder work of doing what
[1:15:06] works.
[1:15:08] He took a shortcut and nothing changed
[1:15:10] inside of him. You know, on our
[1:15:12] Christian walks, people want to come
[1:15:14] have a a great ministry come. They want
[1:15:16] to have special services. They want to
[1:15:18] have camps. And they believe, well, if
[1:15:20] we can just get into that atmosphere,
[1:15:21] then I can be changed. I'm not saying
[1:15:24] you can't.
[1:15:25] People want to to to to have some some
[1:15:28] great man come in and lay hands on them.
[1:15:30] And and if he'll lay hands on me, then
[1:15:32] he'll fix my my my marriage. He'll he'll
[1:15:35] fix my body. He'll fix my financial
[1:15:36] woes. He'll fix my ups and downs. He'll
[1:15:38] fix my in and-outs.
[1:15:42] Church, that's not the way it works.
[1:15:45] Some ministry ain't going to save you.
[1:15:46] It's going to take the Holy Ghost. It's
[1:15:49] going to take an experience with a
[1:15:50] living God to change us. Amen. And a
[1:15:53] simple fact is this. If you want to be
[1:15:55] close to God, first you've got to get
[1:15:57] close to God.
[1:15:59] You need a new birth by the baptism of
[1:16:01] the Holy Ghost that changes you from the
[1:16:04] inside out and makes you accept the word
[1:16:07] of God. And then from that moment, you
[1:16:10] have to feed that relationship. You have
[1:16:12] to read your Bible every day. You have
[1:16:14] to pray to God every day. That means
[1:16:16] have a conversation with God every day.
[1:16:19] And you need to regularly attend the
[1:16:21] preaching of the word of God. There is
[1:16:23] no shortcut to a good relationship with
[1:16:25] God. You need to talk to him. You need
[1:16:27] to read his word. You need to hear his
[1:16:29] word. That's it.
[1:16:32] Supernatural events won't change that.
[1:16:35] Gifts and signs and wonders and miracles
[1:16:37] and healing won't change that. Israel
[1:16:39] had all those things and all but two
[1:16:41] died in the wilderness. You need a
[1:16:44] personal relationship that you're
[1:16:45] feeding every single day.
[1:16:49] Otherwise, we get a camp mentality. We
[1:16:50] get a special meeting mentality. And all
[1:16:52] we do is we bounce from camp to camp,
[1:16:55] from meeting to meeting. And in between,
[1:16:56] you know what we are? failures.
[1:17:00] And I'll tell you this, we come into
[1:17:01] camp, we think we won the victory. You
[1:17:02] didn't win anything. All you did was you
[1:17:05] had an emotional high. And you walk out
[1:17:07] and nothing changes. And within a week
[1:17:09] or two, you're back where you were
[1:17:10] before.
[1:17:12] Why? Because Satan's fooled you into
[1:17:13] looking for an emotional experience
[1:17:16] rather than a dayby-day harder work.
[1:17:18] Success looks a lot like hard work. They
[1:17:20] say that's what it is. That's what it
[1:17:23] is. It goes for everything.
[1:17:26] Eve didn't stick with the proven word.
[1:17:28] Amen. She made the wrong decision. She
[1:17:30] stuck around. She let herself be
[1:17:32] convinced. She stepped out from behind
[1:17:34] the protection of the word to listen to
[1:17:37] something that she thought was better.
[1:17:39] And she took the reasoning of Satan.
[1:17:41] Church, reasoning is not our friend. For
[1:17:44] the believer, reasoning is not where
[1:17:45] it's at. You know, there's only one
[1:17:48] person God ever said to reason with.
[1:17:51] Who? Him.
[1:17:54] He said, "Come, let us reason together,
[1:17:57] saith the Lord."
[1:18:00] He said, "Watch what happens when you
[1:18:02] reason with him, church. Though your
[1:18:04] sins be as scarlet, they shall be white
[1:18:06] as snow. Though they be red like
[1:18:08] crimson, they'll be as wool." And then
[1:18:10] he follows that up and he says, "If you
[1:18:12] be willing and obedient to follow my
[1:18:16] word, then you'll be blessed."
[1:18:19] So the reasoning that God's looking for
[1:18:21] is to take us into his presence and let
[1:18:24] him reason with us. You know what Job's
[1:18:27] problem was?
[1:18:29] People were trying to reason with him
[1:18:30] through their experience.
[1:18:33] And three men, religious men, gave him
[1:18:36] bad advice. And finally, the young guy
[1:18:39] had to stand up and say, "I I've sat and
[1:18:42] I've listened. I've been respectful, but
[1:18:43] I can sit still no more and hear what
[1:18:46] the Lord would have to say. And then
[1:18:48] after that, we see after Eli who sits
[1:18:50] down, God starts to talk with Job. And
[1:18:52] God starts to reason with Job. And
[1:18:54] pretty soon, Job says, "I have spoken
[1:18:56] twice, yay, three times. I will be
[1:18:58] silent." That's the reasoning we need to
[1:19:00] get to. Not up here. Up here. That's the
[1:19:04] only reasoning we're looking for is to
[1:19:05] reason with God through his word. Not
[1:19:08] try and argue, not try and fight, not
[1:19:10] try and persuade. Let him show us his
[1:19:12] truth. Let him show us his way and from
[1:19:15] there we'll come out just right. Amen.
[1:19:18] The only reasoning we should say is what
[1:19:20] does the word say? What does the full
[1:19:24] word say? Because Satan will give you
[1:19:26] one scripture and he'll ignore the other
[1:19:28] 14 that aren't quite in line. He'll
[1:19:31] interpret it for you. Amen. But watch
[1:19:33] what happens with Eve. She made the
[1:19:36] wrong decision. It says, ' And when the
[1:19:38] woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:19:40] food, and that it was pleasant to the
[1:19:42] eye, and a tree to be desired to make
[1:19:44] one wise, she took of the fruit thereof,
[1:19:47] and did eat, and gave also under her
[1:19:48] husband with her, and he did eat. And
[1:19:50] the eyes of them both were opened, and
[1:19:52] they knew that they were naked, and they
[1:19:54] sowed fig leaves together, and made
[1:19:55] themselves e aprons. Church, I want to
[1:19:59] ask you a question. Who got Eve out of
[1:20:02] position?
[1:20:09] Did the serpent get Eve out of position
[1:20:12] for the Garfield? Did they even Who got
[1:20:14] Eve out of position? Was it the serpent?
[1:20:18] Eve got Eve out of position. Who pulled
[1:20:21] her out from behind the word? Did anyone
[1:20:24] pull her or did she step out?
[1:20:27] She stepped out. Amen. She made a
[1:20:30] choice. Satan didn't get her out of
[1:20:32] position. She chose to move out of
[1:20:34] position. She was convinced that what
[1:20:36] she was hearing was better than what she
[1:20:39] had. And by choice, she stepped out from
[1:20:41] behind to the protection of the word.
[1:20:43] Why am I saying that, church?
[1:20:46] Because Satan has no power to make you
[1:20:49] do anything. He has no power over you.
[1:20:52] He has no control over you. He has no
[1:20:55] say in your life. Who does? You do.
[1:20:59] You do. Amen. He has no power to make
[1:21:02] you do something. He has no power to
[1:21:04] keep you from doing something. He can
[1:21:06] place roadblocks in your way. And we'll
[1:21:09] use those as excuses because that's what
[1:21:11] he does. He gives us excuses. He gives
[1:21:14] us reasons. But in the end, there is
[1:21:17] never a reason to disobey the word of
[1:21:19] God. None. Zero. Amen. He has no power
[1:21:23] over you, church. You are not bound to
[1:21:24] him in any way. What Satan has is an
[1:21:27] opportunity to present you with a
[1:21:30] choice. And that's exactly what he does.
[1:21:33] He's presenting you with a choice that
[1:21:35] is contrary to the full word, to the
[1:21:38] open word.
[1:21:42] Listen, if you look at the ministers
[1:21:45] that are around this world professing to
[1:21:46] be Christians, they're preaching a lot
[1:21:48] of things that the Bible doesn't agree
[1:21:49] with because they'll take one scripture.
[1:21:52] And Satan will give you permission by
[1:21:54] one scripture. He tried to do it with
[1:21:56] Jesus. He tried to get Jesus to do
[1:21:58] things by the word. You've got to take
[1:22:00] the full word when it comes to your
[1:22:02] choice in your battle. Amen. But the
[1:22:05] simple fact is this. Today, people are
[1:22:08] making choices without realizing that it
[1:22:11] was a choice or without acknowledging
[1:22:13] that it was their choice.
[1:22:16] And they have to own the consequences,
[1:22:19] good or bad.
[1:22:21] Watch how Eve responds. says, "And the
[1:22:23] Lord God said unto the woman, what is
[1:22:25] this that thouast done? What did you
[1:22:26] do?" And the woman said, "The servant
[1:22:29] begiled me and I did eat." Eve blades a
[1:22:32] serpent. She said, "Servant or the
[1:22:34] serpent?" And she says, "The the serpent
[1:22:36] begiled me." And that word begile means
[1:22:38] he deceived me. He seduced me.
[1:22:42] And the root of this word comes from the
[1:22:44] idea of false optimism.
[1:22:48] In other words, you're presented with
[1:22:49] something that seems really good, that
[1:22:52] seems better than what you have, but in
[1:22:54] reality, it is not. Okay? It's a better
[1:22:56] way. It's a greater way. That's what
[1:22:59] he's offering there. But what's the
[1:23:01] problem, church? Cuz I have no doubt in
[1:23:04] my mind that he did seduce her. He said
[1:23:06] all the right things. He was a
[1:23:08] good-looking guy. But the point is to
[1:23:10] recognize the seduction when it starts.
[1:23:14] That's what we're talking about in this
[1:23:15] series is to recognize what's happening
[1:23:17] before it can ever happen.
[1:23:21] That is the seduction stops before it
[1:23:23] can ever turn into action. Before words
[1:23:26] can ever move into action. Amen. And the
[1:23:28] first way that the serpent responded
[1:23:30] when he gave when Eve gave him the word
[1:23:32] was he contradicted it. He contradicted
[1:23:36] it. That was blatant.
[1:23:38] And right then and there, she should
[1:23:40] have said, "I'm out of here.
[1:23:43] We are not on the same page. How can two
[1:23:45] walk together except we agree? You
[1:23:48] obviously don't believe. I'm out of
[1:23:50] here. That should have been what
[1:23:52] happened. But the seduction was in the
[1:23:55] reasoning that he quickly fed her after
[1:23:57] he disagreed with the word of God. He
[1:24:00] said, "I can make you like God.
[1:24:03] If you do this, you'll be just like
[1:24:06] God." And she decided to stick around
[1:24:08] and talk about that contradiction rather
[1:24:11] than walking away. And pretty soon
[1:24:13] talking led to action which was
[1:24:15] disobedience which led to death. You
[1:24:19] know this happened this this scripture
[1:24:20] is twice in the Bible. That's how
[1:24:22] important it is. And it says there's a
[1:24:24] way that seemth right unto a man but the
[1:24:27] end thereof are the ways of death. Amen.
[1:24:31] Eve couldn't see her own fault in this.
[1:24:35] She blamed it all on the servant.
[1:24:37] Servant. Serpent. Boy. I'm struggling
[1:24:39] with the serpent this morning.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Eve couldn't acknowledge, I made a
[1:24:44] decision. She couldn't see that she had
[1:24:47] done this of her own free will. She
[1:24:49] could only point her finger at the
[1:24:50] serpent church. And too many times
[1:24:53] today, people are blaming Satan for
[1:24:55] their own choices. People are blaming
[1:24:57] Satan for their own consequences and
[1:25:00] results. Amen. Well, Eve didn't eat an
[1:25:02] actual fruit. We know that. But let's
[1:25:04] pretend for a second that she did. Eve
[1:25:06] did not have the serpent standing there
[1:25:08] and he took her hand and he put it on
[1:25:10] the tree and he pulled the apple off and
[1:25:12] he put it here and he forced her mouth
[1:25:13] open. He shoved the apple in and then he
[1:25:15] pushed her jaw up and down and made her
[1:25:16] eat it. Again, we know that's not what
[1:25:18] happened. But let's pretend it does for
[1:25:20] a minute. He didn't make her do that. He
[1:25:23] offered her the opportunity. And the
[1:25:25] scripture says she took, she saw,
[1:25:29] [snorts]
[1:25:30] she perceived, she acted. The action is
[1:25:33] all hers. It's not the serpents to
[1:25:35] blame.
[1:25:38] Amen.
[1:25:40] We have to own our decisions and we have
[1:25:44] to own the results.
[1:25:46] What I find so often is people blaming
[1:25:49] bad results on supposed good decisions.
[1:25:53] And that can't be true. It violates the
[1:25:55] law of the harvest that's in scripture.
[1:25:57] You can't plant good seed and get bad
[1:25:59] crops. You can't do it. If you plant
[1:26:02] good seed, you'll get good crops. you
[1:26:04] plant bad seed, you'll get bad crops.
[1:26:06] Amen. That doesn't mean that every good
[1:26:08] decision you make feels good. That
[1:26:11] doesn't mean that every good decision
[1:26:13] you make feels or or produces good
[1:26:16] things on this earth. By no means is
[1:26:19] that the case. But what it means is that
[1:26:20] a wordbased decision produces word
[1:26:23] results.
[1:26:25] Look at the decisions that the disciples
[1:26:27] had to make. Because when you stand for
[1:26:29] the word, you're going to face
[1:26:30] persecution, misunderstanding,
[1:26:33] ignorance, shame,
[1:26:36] slander,
[1:26:38] separation, loss of relationship, loss
[1:26:41] of opportunity. Church, you can lose
[1:26:43] your job. You can limit your career. You
[1:26:45] can lose your career.
[1:26:48] You can be limited in this life by
[1:26:51] living by the word. Absolutely you can.
[1:26:54] Absolutely you can. Amen. But if the
[1:26:58] fruit of the word is produced in your
[1:27:00] life, in the long run, you're better off
[1:27:02] than anything Satan would have offered.
[1:27:04] Okay? What will happen when you make a
[1:27:07] word-based decision is you'll produce
[1:27:09] the fruit of the spirit. You'll reflect
[1:27:11] Christ in a greater way
[1:27:14] and you'll be closer to God. A
[1:27:16] word-based decision always takes you
[1:27:19] closer to God. Always.
[1:27:22] Too many people are trying to see how
[1:27:24] close can I get to the world and still
[1:27:26] serve God. No, no, no. We're supposed to
[1:27:28] be as tight to him as possible. Hold
[1:27:30] close to him. Amen.
[1:27:35] Listen, we look around this church.
[1:27:39] We're not rich. We don't have big
[1:27:41] lifestyles. We don't all drive big brand
[1:27:44] new vehicles. We don't all have big big
[1:27:46] houses.
[1:27:48] It's tough, isn't it, Brother Matt?
[1:27:50] Sometimes most of us are single- inome
[1:27:52] homes because we've got our wives
[1:27:54] staying at home to raise the kids and
[1:27:56] teach the kids and all these things.
[1:27:57] It's hard. It wears on us.
[1:28:00] We pay a price by living by the word.
[1:28:04] Absolutely we do. But what do we have
[1:28:07] out of that, brothers and sisters? We
[1:28:09] have unshakable families. We have
[1:28:12] wonderful marriages.
[1:28:14] We have a way to enjoy life by the
[1:28:17] simpler things. And we don't need
[1:28:19] everything that this world has. We don't
[1:28:21] need alcohol to have a good time. We
[1:28:22] don't need drugs. We don't need
[1:28:23] sensuality. We don't need rock and roll.
[1:28:25] We don't need to dance and grind on each
[1:28:27] other to have a good time. And when we
[1:28:28] have a good time, we can remember it.
[1:28:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:34] I remember when I was in high school and
[1:28:36] you ask people, "How'd your week weekend
[1:28:37] go?" or university. I don't know. We
[1:28:39] just got smashed. It was a great time.
[1:28:42] What did you do? I don't know. It was
[1:28:43] just great. How you feeling today? Not
[1:28:45] great.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:28:52] because it's a long game with Christ.
[1:28:55] It's a long game. What we sacrifice
[1:28:58] today produces a big result down the
[1:29:00] road. Amen. See, God plays the long
[1:29:02] game, too. Satan's patient, but when it
[1:29:06] comes to his offering, his offering is
[1:29:08] almost instant. Satan's always offering
[1:29:11] instant gratification. He's offering
[1:29:13] shortcuts. Amen. So his he's all about
[1:29:16] the instant rewards and God is about the
[1:29:18] eternal rewards. Right? That's one way
[1:29:21] to judge a decision is is it immediate
[1:29:23] or is it long-term? Because if it's
[1:29:25] immediate, it will almost always almost
[1:29:28] always now be Satan offering it
[1:29:31] because God is about sewing and
[1:29:33] harvesting. Satan's about giving you
[1:29:35] what you did not sow.
[1:29:38] That's the way that he works. Amen.
[1:29:40] Instant rewards are rarely of God.
[1:29:42] Satan's desperately trying to keep you
[1:29:44] from looking down the road and get you
[1:29:47] to look right here and now.
[1:29:50] And what God's trying to do is
[1:29:51] desperately trying to get you look down
[1:29:53] the road so you can see what's of
[1:29:55] greatest value. Satan's trying to get
[1:29:57] you to look right here. What feels good?
[1:30:00] What would be good today? What would
[1:30:01] make life more enjoyable? What would
[1:30:02] make life easier? What is it that I
[1:30:04] really, really, really want? Can I have
[1:30:06] it today? and in other but God's there
[1:30:08] trying to say can you look at what I
[1:30:10] have for you because when you get it my
[1:30:13] way you'll have character to handle it
[1:30:16] but if you do it Satan's way you'll have
[1:30:18] no character and it won't last and
[1:30:21] there'll be a price to pay down the
[1:30:23] road. Amen.
[1:30:25] So God's trying to get you to look
[1:30:27] further down the road to see the impact
[1:30:29] of it. And Satan's saying look what I
[1:30:30] can give you today. And God's saying
[1:30:32] look what I can give you forever.
[1:30:35] Church, if you could have a million
[1:30:37] dollars today
[1:30:39] or a billion dollars forever, what would
[1:30:41] you take?
[1:30:43] Let me say this. Too often our decision,
[1:30:45] the million dollars today
[1:30:48] because it's Satan. Satan's good at what
[1:30:50] he does. We pick those things that are
[1:30:52] so immediate. Amen. You don't see the
[1:30:54] long-term benefit from having daily
[1:30:57] devotions in one week.
[1:31:01] That's like saying, "I'm going to have a
[1:31:02] great marriage based on one week of
[1:31:04] close relationship." No, it takes years
[1:31:07] to develop a close relationship with
[1:31:09] God. Amen. But you'll absolutely see the
[1:31:13] benefit of picking up your phone for 30
[1:31:15] minutes and doom scrolling. What's the
[1:31:17] benefit?
[1:31:19] Mindless entertainment.
[1:31:22] But what's going to happen when you put
[1:31:23] that phone down? You'll forget
[1:31:25] everything you looked at. It has no
[1:31:27] lasting or eternal value except that you
[1:31:30] filled your mind to take up space of
[1:31:32] things that should have been filled with
[1:31:34] God.
[1:31:36] Come on
[1:31:38] right in the moment. How many people
[1:31:42] [clears throat]
[1:31:43] don't raise your hands?
[1:31:46] How many people
[1:31:48] stay up on their phone or their laptop
[1:31:51] or their iPad or whatever you have, your
[1:31:53] tablet,
[1:31:55] longer than you should, so you go to bed
[1:31:57] late and then get up the next morning
[1:32:00] and say, "I'm really glad I stayed up
[1:32:01] and did that." How many have done that?
[1:32:04] How many say that was that was a
[1:32:05] wonderful use of my time. I'm really
[1:32:07] glad I did that. None of us, right? But
[1:32:10] what did Satan offer in the moment? He
[1:32:12] said, "Let's have some fun before we go
[1:32:15] to bed. Let's entertain ourselves before
[1:32:17] bed. Let's relax before we go to bed."
[1:32:19] You know what we really need to do,
[1:32:21] church? We need to go to bed. That's
[1:32:23] what will relax us is go to bed. But he
[1:32:25] presents us with an opportunity.
[1:32:28] And I'll tell you this, it never takes
[1:32:30] you anywhere good.
[1:32:32] I speak by experience. Never takes you
[1:32:35] anywhere good. Total waste of your time.
[1:32:39] If you would take that 30 minutes,
[1:32:42] don't lay down, sit up, pray, read your
[1:32:44] Bible, listen to a sermon, talk to your
[1:32:48] spouse, god forbid, you'll be better
[1:32:51] off. It'll have eternal value. It'll
[1:32:53] have lasting value. But see, remember
[1:32:55] what Satan does. He seduces.
[1:32:58] Amen.
[1:33:00] I don't want to get too explicit today,
[1:33:02] but remember what a sed what a seduction
[1:33:04] is. A seduction is temporary pleasure
[1:33:09] followed by lasting regret.
[1:33:12] That's my words.
[1:33:14] Temporary pleasure followed by lasting
[1:33:17] regret. A seduction seems to be good. It
[1:33:20] seems to have benefits, but really
[1:33:22] there's only one person that walks away
[1:33:24] after a seduction happy, and it's never
[1:33:27] you.
[1:33:29] In the moment, you might feel real
[1:33:31] happy, but when it's all said and done,
[1:33:33] only one walks away happy because they
[1:33:35] got what they really wanted. And you
[1:33:37] didn't get what you wanted because it
[1:33:38] was a seduction. It was a lie from the
[1:33:40] beginning so the other person could get
[1:33:42] what they really wanted.
[1:33:46] He says, "Satan tries to show you
[1:33:48] something better,
[1:33:50] an easier way, a more sensible plan. But
[1:33:53] there's no more sensible plan than that
[1:33:55] God laid down at the beginning, his
[1:33:57] word." He says, "Hold that word. Get a
[1:33:59] grip on it. Let it get a grip on you and
[1:34:02] stay there with it." That's the thing.
[1:34:04] The battle raged when Eve opened up her
[1:34:08] mind to listen to her reasoning.
[1:34:12] She in her soul reasoned and her eyes
[1:34:16] were sight. Now catch what he's saying
[1:34:18] there. He's saying she re because she
[1:34:20] reasoned now her natural senses are
[1:34:24] confirming what she reasoned.
[1:34:29] Her natural eyes confirmed a lie.
[1:34:33] Okay?
[1:34:36] Before this, when she saw this, she was
[1:34:40] repulsed by it because the word said,
[1:34:43] "Don't do it. It'll cause you death.
[1:34:45] It'll cause you bad things." And so,
[1:34:47] before this time, before reasoning,
[1:34:49] before seduction, when she saw the fruit
[1:34:52] of the tree,
[1:34:54] it repulsed her. She turned her eyes
[1:34:57] away. She didn't dwell on it.
[1:35:01] But now that reasoning has crept in, her
[1:35:04] five senses go to work and her eyes
[1:35:07] confirm what her mind and soul have
[1:35:09] reasoned, which is this is good.
[1:35:15] See how Satan uses your five senses?
[1:35:19] He says, "She saw the serpent. He was
[1:35:22] beautiful, handsome, far better than her
[1:35:24] own husband. He was the most subtle of
[1:35:26] all the beasts of the field. He was
[1:35:27] probably a fairer man than her husband.
[1:35:29] He looked like a great masculine beast
[1:35:31] standing there. How great he was. And he
[1:35:33] was trying to tell her what a great
[1:35:35] thing it was. And the first thing she
[1:35:36] did, she opened up what? Her mind. And
[1:35:41] when she did, human reasonings caught
[1:35:43] it. Why wouldn't that be a thrill,
[1:35:46] church? Who got the great thrill that
[1:35:48] day?
[1:35:51] It was good for a moment. The serpent
[1:35:52] got a thrill. Eve got a thrill. Adam got
[1:35:56] a thrill.
[1:35:59] But after the thrill wore off, who still
[1:36:02] had a thrill? Only the serpent. Adam and
[1:36:06] Eve are the ones that are now now with
[1:36:08] fear, with doubt, with guilt, with
[1:36:12] self-loathing,
[1:36:14] hiding from the presence of God. Only
[1:36:16] one person gets the thrill in the
[1:36:18] seduction that lasts, and that's the one
[1:36:19] that got what they wanted. And I'll tell
[1:36:21] you this, in a seduction, the believer
[1:36:23] never gets the thrill for long. It never
[1:36:25] works out that way. They were the ones
[1:36:27] paying the price and the serpent just
[1:36:29] went on being a beast because that's
[1:36:30] what beasts do. He was just in it for
[1:36:33] himself. The thrill didn't last that
[1:36:36] long. And that's the way it works with
[1:36:37] the believer. When Satan's seduction's
[1:36:39] over, the thrill wears off and all
[1:36:41] you're left with is brokenness, guilt,
[1:36:43] and regret. I speak by experience,
[1:36:46] church. We've all been fooled. We've all
[1:36:49] been fooled. and all you're left with is
[1:36:51] brokenness. And usually what happens is
[1:36:53] you don't want to come back to God and
[1:36:54] and confess it. And we lose that
[1:36:57] relationship. Amen. But we say, "Well,
[1:36:58] brother John, that was Eve. That was a
[1:37:00] different day, different situation,
[1:37:02] different test. She failed. That's that.
[1:37:03] But we're living in a different day."
[1:37:05] That's not how he does it with me.
[1:37:07] That's exactly how he does it with us.
[1:37:11] He does it exactly the way that he did
[1:37:12] it with her. Listen to what Paul said
[1:37:14] now. And he's going to say this to the
[1:37:15] Corinthian church. Second Corinthians,
[1:37:17] the church that is the written epistle
[1:37:19] seen and read of all men, the living
[1:37:21] proof of his gospel. Here's what he says
[1:37:22] to that church. This is an overcoming
[1:37:25] church. Now, he says, "For I am jealous
[1:37:28] over you with godly jealousy, for I have
[1:37:30] espoused you to one husband that I may
[1:37:33] present you as a chasteed virgin to
[1:37:35] Christ. But I fear, I'm concerned, I
[1:37:38] worry, lest by any means as a serpent
[1:37:41] beguiled, as a serpent seduced Eve
[1:37:44] through his subtlety,
[1:37:48] so your minds should be corrupted from
[1:37:51] the simplicity that is in Christ.
[1:37:55] So as he did it with Eve, so he'll do it
[1:37:58] with you. Same process, same argument,
[1:38:02] same attack, same approach, same
[1:38:05] presentation. No difference. The way he
[1:38:08] does it is the same every time. It's a
[1:38:10] seduction. It's subtle. It's not
[1:38:13] obvious. Amen. And we're going to close
[1:38:14] shortly, but I want to point a few
[1:38:16] things here before we we close for this
[1:38:18] afternoon. His approach is always
[1:38:20] seduction. It's to make what is contrary
[1:38:23] to the word appeal to your flesh,
[1:38:26] appeal to your mind, appeal to your
[1:38:29] human nature. Amen. It's shortterm gain
[1:38:33] for long-term pain. Okay? Seduction is
[1:38:38] short-term gain for long-term pain. But
[1:38:41] they never tell you about the pain part.
[1:38:44] Okay? Satan's approach is s his is
[1:38:46] seduction is through our minds. That's
[1:38:50] where it starts. Amen. There's gateways
[1:38:52] he uses. We'll get into that as we go
[1:38:54] through this series. Five outer senses,
[1:38:55] five inner senses. But the ultimate
[1:38:57] battle is in our minds. And that's means
[1:39:01] that it's a choice every day.
[1:39:05] A mind is just choices. That's what's in
[1:39:08] our mind is choices day by day. We might
[1:39:10] not want to admit it, but that battle is
[1:39:12] conscious. It's conscious. It should be
[1:39:15] conscious.
[1:39:18] So many times we think we're just going
[1:39:20] through our days, church. We're not.
[1:39:21] We're in a battle. And every choice
[1:39:25] matters.
[1:39:27] Every choice matters. It's real. It's
[1:39:29] going on constantly. And our actions,
[1:39:31] the way we live, the way we talk, the
[1:39:33] way we respond is merely a result of who
[1:39:35] won the battle in our mind for that
[1:39:37] moment. Okay. But I like how he
[1:39:40] finishes. He says that it should be
[1:39:42] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[1:39:44] Christ. Christ the word is simple. It is
[1:39:48] straightforward. That word simplicity
[1:39:50] means single-mindedness,
[1:39:53] bountifulness,
[1:39:54] simpleness, and catch this. Liberality.
[1:40:00] There's a freedom in the spirit. There's
[1:40:02] a freedom in the word. Church, when you
[1:40:03] look at what God has offered us, you
[1:40:05] talk about liberality.
[1:40:07] There's nothing that he withholds from
[1:40:09] us that is good for us. That's the
[1:40:12] liberality of the word of God. Amen.
[1:40:14] It's But it it points this idea of
[1:40:16] simplicity, the the root of it is that
[1:40:19] it's a a piece of cloth that isn't
[1:40:21] folded up. Now, if you've ever seen
[1:40:23] something, take a garment, take a shirt,
[1:40:26] uh take a a shawl or something like
[1:40:28] that. You wrap it up, you can't see
[1:40:30] what's all in it. You could have a shirt
[1:40:32] that it's folded up and it looks white
[1:40:34] and plain on the outside, but when you
[1:40:36] open it up, it's got some nasty thing
[1:40:38] written on the front of it.
[1:40:40] The point here is that everything God
[1:40:42] offers you is open and plain. His
[1:40:45] promises are clear. His path is clear.
[1:40:48] God shows you upfront. He shows you the
[1:40:51] pain and he shows you the reward. It's
[1:40:54] all there. God is not trying to hide it
[1:40:55] from us. More to the point, God's trying
[1:40:57] to reveal it to us. Satan's the one
[1:41:00] that's trying to hide it. Amen. So,
[1:41:01] Satan's try God's trying to reveal his
[1:41:03] goodness, not just to us, but in us. And
[1:41:06] Satan's trying to hide his badness from
[1:41:09] us, but present it as if it's something
[1:41:11] good. Christ is simple. Satan is subtle.
[1:41:15] Satan's trying to hide. God's trying to
[1:41:17] reveal. So, let me say it this way.
[1:41:19] Overcoming comes through the mind.
[1:41:23] Now, the real battle's won in the soul.
[1:41:26] Because if your soul is sealed by the
[1:41:28] Holy Ghost, you've already won. But you
[1:41:31] can live in failure in this life if that
[1:41:33] doesn't translate into your mind.
[1:41:36] Okay,
[1:41:37] we have to make a choice. It starts in
[1:41:40] the soul, but it activates in the mind.
[1:41:42] Amen. That choice is your part and it's
[1:41:44] my part. That's the part that we play.
[1:41:46] We choose the word or we choose
[1:41:48] seduction.
[1:41:51] And I'm closing. But I've never been
[1:41:53] seduced by a woman outside of marriage.
[1:41:56] [snorts]
[1:41:58] Now, my wife laughs at me because she
[1:42:00] says, "You're clueless about what women
[1:42:02] are trying to do sometimes.
[1:42:05] I remember I was on the bus one time. I
[1:42:07] think I've told the story and I always
[1:42:08] I'd read read a book a day in university
[1:42:10] pretty much. And I get on the bus and I
[1:42:11] was reading a book and this girl taps me
[1:42:13] on the shoulder. She says, 'Hey, didn't
[1:42:14] I see you on George Street last night?
[1:42:16] This was a Friday, Thursday night's a
[1:42:17] big drinking night. George Street's the
[1:42:19] bar where all the bars are if you don't
[1:42:20] know it in [snorts] St. John's. Didn't I
[1:42:23] see you on George Street last night? I
[1:42:24] look, no.
[1:42:27] She said, I'm sure I saw you. Weren't
[1:42:29] you down on George Street last night? I
[1:42:30] said, no, I don't drink. And I went back
[1:42:32] to my book and looked down. I told my
[1:42:34] wife cuz we were dating at the time. She
[1:42:35] said, "John, she was hitting on you.
[1:42:37] She's trying to strike a conversation."
[1:42:38] I said, "I okay, whatever." I didn't
[1:42:40] notice. But I'll tell you this, when I
[1:42:42] gave my heart to the Lord, the door to a
[1:42:44] woman's seduction closed
[1:42:47] because I already had somebody that I
[1:42:49] was interested in. But more to the
[1:42:51] point, I'm not interested in somebody
[1:42:53] that can't be my wife.
[1:42:56] So if she ain't a believer,
[1:42:58] there's no point in having anything more
[1:42:59] than a basic conversation that you would
[1:43:01] with anybody being polite. But there's
[1:43:04] no friendship. There's no closeness.
[1:43:05] There's no opportunity for seduction.
[1:43:08] But I've been seduced many other ways,
[1:43:10] church. I've been seduced many other
[1:43:12] ways. I've been offered multiple times
[1:43:14] opportunities to run companies. In
[1:43:18] Texas, when I was first offered this
[1:43:19] opportunity,
[1:43:21] they offered me they had a brand new
[1:43:23] acquisition and my boss called me up and
[1:43:26] it this was on a Friday afternoon. He
[1:43:28] called me up. He says, "Do not leave
[1:43:30] work. I'm on my way back from Houston. I
[1:43:32] need to talk to you about an opportunity
[1:43:34] and it can't wait." So, I stayed and I
[1:43:37] stuck around and he comes up and he
[1:43:39] comes into my office and he's just
[1:43:40] glowing. He's happy for me. He's he's
[1:43:42] got good news. He sits down. He says,
[1:43:43] "Hey, we just bought such and such a
[1:43:45] company down in Houston." And I talked
[1:43:47] with with Mark, who's the VP of our
[1:43:49] division. He said, I talked with Mark,
[1:43:51] Mark, and I think you're the one to run
[1:43:52] it.
[1:43:55] Multi-million dollar company.
[1:43:58] He says, "You, if you're willing to move
[1:44:00] to Houston, we'll let you take over.
[1:44:02] It'll be your baby. We want you to grow
[1:44:04] it. We want you to expand it." Now,
[1:44:06] church, it was flattering.
[1:44:08] So flattering to be considered
[1:44:11] flattering to be considered capable.
[1:44:14] There are lots of people I would have
[1:44:15] leaprogged multiple people in my
[1:44:17] organization to take that role. I had
[1:44:19] won I was the first one to win an
[1:44:21] employee of the year at that at that at
[1:44:23] that company when they did that award.
[1:44:27] I'd done so well there. God had blessed
[1:44:28] me so much. And you know what the
[1:44:30] temptation was? God's blessing me again.
[1:44:33] God's giving me a great promotion.
[1:44:37] Okay, church. We're talking about
[1:44:39] seductions now. Okay, keep this in your
[1:44:42] mind as we close. Now, let me tell you,
[1:44:44] as soon as he said that, remember we're
[1:44:46] receptors of thoughts. You know, the
[1:44:48] first thing that came to my mind,
[1:44:51] I can finally buy that Porsche 911 I
[1:44:53] always wanted.
[1:44:57] Second thing, I can get a much nicer
[1:45:00] house than this broken down piece we've
[1:45:02] got.
[1:45:04] Three, I can live a better lifestyle. I
[1:45:07] can make more money. I can get stock
[1:45:10] options. I'll get a bonus every year. I
[1:45:12] will be the youngest executive in
[1:45:15] company history. And this was a company
[1:45:16] that was been around for over a hundred
[1:45:18] years. Church,
[1:45:20] you talk about seducing.
[1:45:23] I was making $82,000 a year.
[1:45:28] You don't want to know what I could have
[1:45:29] made.
[1:45:31] Massive multi-billion dollar company.
[1:45:34] Okay, talk about seduction. But here's
[1:45:38] the thing.
[1:45:41] I didn't go home and consider it.
[1:45:44] I didn't go home and talk to my wife
[1:45:46] about it. I didn't go home and pray
[1:45:49] about it.
[1:45:51] You know what I did right then and
[1:45:52] there? I said, "I'm sorry. I'm not
[1:45:55] interested. And by the way, I'm
[1:45:56] resigning and I'm moving back to
[1:45:57] Canada."
[1:45:59] You know why?
[1:46:01] Because if I moved to Houston, it was
[1:46:04] too far away to make church on Wednesday
[1:46:05] night.
[1:46:07] And it was a long drive for Sundays.
[1:46:10] So, you know what happens when it's a
[1:46:12] long drive, right?
[1:46:15] You make excuses.
[1:46:17] You choose excuses.
[1:46:20] I was going to miss every Wednesday
[1:46:22] night service. I was one of two deacons,
[1:46:24] so I wasn't going to be at my post of
[1:46:26] duty half the time. Now, church, let me
[1:46:29] say this. Your post of duty is here
[1:46:32] regardless of whether you have a
[1:46:33] position.
[1:46:35] But I wasn't going to make Wednesday
[1:46:37] nights. Sundays were going to be a long
[1:46:38] haul. There's no fellowship there.
[1:46:42] No other church there at the time. We
[1:46:44] would have been completely isolated from
[1:46:47] believers
[1:46:49] day in and day out. We'd miss half the
[1:46:51] church services and probably more at
[1:46:53] times.
[1:46:55] Why did I turn it down, church? Because
[1:46:57] I kept the word in front of me. And the
[1:46:59] word says, "Forsake not the assembling
[1:47:01] of yourselves together, and all the more
[1:47:04] as you see the day approaching." You
[1:47:06] know what that means, church? Wednesdays
[1:47:08] aren't optional. For me,
[1:47:12] that's the way I took it. There was an
[1:47:15] absolute that was secured in my heart. I
[1:47:18] go to church when the church doors open.
[1:47:21] That is my place of duty is to be in
[1:47:24] church when the doors open. That meant
[1:47:27] that job was never an option.
[1:47:31] So, you know what, church? When did the
[1:47:33] seduction stop? Immediately. And my boss
[1:47:36] looked at me. He couldn't believe it. He
[1:47:38] had driven in a and he was a fast
[1:47:40] driver, too. He had driven up in a hurry
[1:47:44] to catch me so as not to intrude into my
[1:47:46] weekend to give me this wonderful news.
[1:47:48] And I not only turned him down, but I
[1:47:50] resigned and moved to Canada a month or
[1:47:51] two later because that's where God had
[1:47:54] told us to go.
[1:47:56] And what did Satan do? He seduced me
[1:47:58] with an offer to stay.
[1:48:01] But here's the thing, church. What was
[1:48:03] the bait? The bait was, I can give you
[1:48:06] the car you want. I can give you the
[1:48:08] house you deserve.
[1:48:11] I can give you a company that you can
[1:48:12] attach your success to. Leverage it to
[1:48:15] be bigger and better. Maybe I could have
[1:48:17] been CEO of Lufkin Industries if I
[1:48:18] stayed there. Multi-billion dollar
[1:48:20] company. You know what I used to do? I
[1:48:22] used to track the straight the the stock
[1:48:24] trades of all the executives. These guys
[1:48:26] every year cashing in a million dollars
[1:48:27] in stock, million dollars in stock,
[1:48:29] million dollars in stock, $10 million in
[1:48:31] stock.
[1:48:33] You talk about a seduction, but the
[1:48:35] thing is this, what matters? What do you
[1:48:38] value? What do you value? That's what
[1:48:40] comes out when you make those decisions.
[1:48:42] And Satan said, you can have a great
[1:48:44] career. You can make lots of money. You
[1:48:46] won't have to struggle in life. You can
[1:48:49] have lots of fun. You can have the
[1:48:50] vehicle vehicles you always wanted. But
[1:48:54] the reality was you will sacrifice your
[1:48:56] family for it.
[1:48:59] But he didn't say that. He never says
[1:49:02] that because you never tell the result
[1:49:04] of a seduction beforehand.
[1:49:07] Paul looks at our minds, points to our
[1:49:09] minds. And I want to close with this
[1:49:10] thought. The battle we face is not
[1:49:13] physical.
[1:49:15] The battle we face is spiritual. The
[1:49:18] battle we face did not start here. It
[1:49:20] started up there. And when God defeated
[1:49:22] Satan and kicked him out, he came down
[1:49:24] here. And now the battle's for us. So
[1:49:26] that's what we're fighting every day.
[1:49:27] Amen. It's a battle for our mind,
[1:49:29] seeking control of our body, seeking
[1:49:31] control of our souls. We're not fighting
[1:49:33] a battle through our five senses. We're
[1:49:34] not fighting fighting a battle through
[1:49:35] our inner five senses. Amen. We're not
[1:49:38] swinging swords. We're not shooting
[1:49:39] guns. We're not dropping bombs. We're
[1:49:41] not flying planes. That would make it
[1:49:43] simpler. Hard but simple. But this is a
[1:49:46] daybyday,
[1:49:48] momentby-moment battle and there's no
[1:49:50] relief. There's no relief. Church, you
[1:49:53] can be reading your Bible and Satan will
[1:49:55] come in and try and do something.
[1:49:57] Absolutely. When When do the children
[1:50:00] always want to fight?
[1:50:02] When you're having devotions, when
[1:50:04] you're studying for service, when does
[1:50:06] the dog always want to bark? When
[1:50:08] nobody's home to shut him up, and you
[1:50:10] have to get out from your office where
[1:50:11] you're studying faithfully for service
[1:50:13] and run up and tell them to shut up.
[1:50:16] That's the way he works. He's always
[1:50:19] working. He's always trying to
[1:50:21] frustrate. He's always trying to fill.
[1:50:23] He's always trying to overwhelm. He's
[1:50:25] always trying to distract.
[1:50:28] And it's up here that he starts it. And
[1:50:30] what happens is we act on it and we
[1:50:33] blame our actions on that. But we lost
[1:50:34] the battle here. We didn't recognize we
[1:50:37] were in a battle and therefore we lost
[1:50:40] it. You can't win a battle you don't
[1:50:42] know you're fighting. You can't do that.
[1:50:45] Amen. This is not a natural war. It's a
[1:50:47] supernatural war. I There's a song that
[1:50:50] I heard a long time ago and and there's
[1:50:52] one line that struck me and it said,
[1:50:53] "Every choice is an act of war." Every
[1:50:57] choice is an act of war. And it is
[1:50:59] because you're either supporting him
[1:51:02] or you're supporting him.
[1:51:05] That's it. Remember that Indian that got
[1:51:07] saved and he said, you know, he asked
[1:51:09] him, "How you doing?" He says,
[1:51:10] "Someday's good, some days not so good."
[1:51:12] He says, "What makes the difference?" He
[1:51:14] says, "I have two dogs fighting inside
[1:51:15] me. A black one and a white one." He
[1:51:18] says, "They're white. They're fighting
[1:51:19] every day. One's good, one's bad." He
[1:51:21] says, "Which one wins?" He says, "The
[1:51:22] one I feed the most."
[1:51:24] That's the way it is. Every choice is an
[1:51:26] act of war. Every choice feeds either
[1:51:29] Satan's power in your life, influence,
[1:51:33] or God's. And it's very simple. It's
[1:51:36] very simple. Amen.
[1:51:39] What's Satan's trick? seduce to try and
[1:51:43] make us think he has more for us than
[1:51:45] God does. Better, more, more immediate,
[1:51:49] easier to try and get today what was
[1:51:52] meant for tomorrow. That's what he
[1:51:54] offered Jesus. He said, "Bow down,
[1:51:57] worship me. I'll give you all the
[1:51:58] kingdoms. You don't have to die for
[1:51:59] them. I'll give them to you." We're
[1:52:01] going to get through this. You'll see
[1:52:02] when Jesus did that, he he he fought all
[1:52:04] three of the lusts that Paul talks about
[1:52:06] and he overcame all of them. Amen. To
[1:52:08] try. What is Satan's seduction, church?
[1:52:10] to try and make it about us rather than
[1:52:13] about God. Make it about us rather than
[1:52:16] about the word. To make us feel good
[1:52:19] rather than make the word have the
[1:52:20] preeminence in our life. Amen. Let's
[1:52:22] stand together if we would. [snorts]
[1:52:25] What's our response?
[1:52:27] Anybody else in a battle?
[1:52:30] Amen. Brother Grant's got two hands up.
[1:52:34] We're in a battle. We're in a battle.
[1:52:37] I I had a long day yesterday. I got up
[1:52:40] and because it's a new series, I studied
[1:52:42] and I studied and I studied. I came up,
[1:52:44] I ate supper, we got ready and we came
[1:52:46] in for a prayer meeting. Like, it was a
[1:52:48] long, long day. And at the end of it,
[1:52:49] you just think, I'm wore out. I'm wore
[1:52:53] out. But you know what? I came into
[1:52:56] church this morning and everybody
[1:52:58] started singing. It's like, I'm not so
[1:53:00] tired anymore.
[1:53:02] Praise the Lord. This is good. It's good
[1:53:04] to be here. It's good to be here. What
[1:53:06] is our response, church? It's the word.
[1:53:09] It's faith in the word. It is written.
[1:53:12] It is written. It is written. And then
[1:53:14] we walk away. We walk away. Leave him
[1:53:18] standing. You know the most frustrating
[1:53:20] thing? I say this as a person that likes
[1:53:21] to win arguments. When somebody refuses
[1:53:24] to argue. When someone refuses to let me
[1:53:27] beat them up.
[1:53:29] Because Satan's law is reason.
[1:53:33] He's better at reasoning than you and I.
[1:53:35] Our only weapon. Our only weapon. it is
[1:53:38] written. That's it. And then we walk
[1:53:41] away because he can take it or leave it.
[1:53:43] The point is, I've taken it and I'm
[1:53:45] staying with the word. That's our
[1:53:47] response. That's how you respond to a
[1:53:49] seduction. It is written and you walk
[1:53:51] away. Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our
[1:53:54] heads. Heavenly [snorts] Father,
[1:53:57] Lord, how thankful I am this morning.
[1:53:59] Lord, I'm thankful for your word. I'm
[1:54:01] thankful for your presence, your
[1:54:02] anointing. Lord, I'm thankful for the
[1:54:04] direction you've given, heavenly father.
[1:54:06] Lord, I'm just asking as we start
[1:54:08] another series, Lord, trusting this is
[1:54:10] your leadership, Lord, that you will use
[1:54:12] it to sharpen our discernment, Lord,
[1:54:14] with the intent that we will overcome,
[1:54:18] Lord, that we'll recognize our position.
[1:54:20] We'll recognize every trick of Satan,
[1:54:23] Lord, and we'll recognize your personal
[1:54:25] presence in our lives is what gives us
[1:54:26] overcoming power, Lord. I pray you help
[1:54:29] us stay with your word, Lord. Let it be
[1:54:31] in our mind. Let it be on our lips,
[1:54:33] Lord. May we dwell on it. May we
[1:54:34] meditate on it day by day, heavenly
[1:54:36] father. Lord, may we feed, Lord, the
[1:54:39] power of God that is within us. We pray,
[1:54:41] Lord, your spirit feeds on your word. We
[1:54:43] know that, Lord. I pray you help us to
[1:54:45] feed on the right things, Lord. Let us
[1:54:47] recognize we're in a battle every single
[1:54:49] moment of every single day, Lord. Help
[1:54:52] us to make those right choices, Lord.
[1:54:53] Let us see things for what they are,
[1:54:56] Lord. And having done all to stand,
[1:54:57] Lord, let us stand, Lord, so you can
[1:54:59] pour in more of your spirit, Lord. Your
[1:55:01] word says resist the devil and he will
[1:55:04] flee from you. Lord, let us push back.
[1:55:07] Lord, let us hold fast to what you've
[1:55:08] given us. I pray,
[1:55:11] Lord, I pray you help us to choose a
[1:55:12] life rather than a lifestyle.
[1:55:15] Lord, that rich young ruler came and he
[1:55:17] wanted eternal life, but he turned it
[1:55:18] down because he wanted a lifestyle that
[1:55:20] pleased himself. Lord, I pray you help
[1:55:23] us to see, Lord, we're not here for
[1:55:25] lifestyle. We're here for eternal life.
[1:55:28] Lord, help us to choose the things that
[1:55:29] matter eternally. Lord, may we not
[1:55:31] sacrifice ourselves, our children, our
[1:55:34] families, Lord, on the altar of
[1:55:35] lifestyle. Lord, I pray you help us to
[1:55:38] make the right decision, Lord, to be in
[1:55:40] fellowship with you constantly. Grant us
[1:55:42] grace, Lord. Give us strength day by
[1:55:44] day, Lord. It is your strength that's
[1:55:46] going to get us through, Lord, and we're
[1:55:48] trusting in you. Bless your people now.
[1:55:50] We pray, Lord God, in Jesus Christ's
[1:55:51] name we ask it. Amen.
[1:55:55] Lord, I give you my heart. This is my
[1:55:57] desire. 10:19.
[1:56:02] This is my desire
[1:56:08] to honor
[1:56:12] you.
[1:56:16] Lord, [singing] with all my heart
[1:56:21] I worship you.
[1:56:25] [music]
[1:56:30] And all I have within [singing]
[1:56:35] me, [music]
[1:56:37] I give
[1:56:40] you
[1:56:41] praise. [music]
[1:56:45] All that I adore,
[1:56:50] [music] it is [singing] in you.
[1:57:00] So Lord, [singing] I give you my heart.
[1:57:04] [music] I give you my soul.
[1:57:09] I live [music and singing] for you
[1:57:13] alone.
[1:57:15] Every [music and singing] breath that I
[1:57:17] take,
[1:57:18] every moment I'm awake,
[1:57:22] [music]
[1:57:24] Lord, have [singing] your way in me.
[1:57:28] [music] And Lord, I give you my heart.

[1:57:47] every moment I'm awake,
[1:57:51] [music]
[1:57:53] Lord, have [singing] your way in me.
[1:57:57] [music]
[1:58:00] Oh, this is my desire
[1:58:05] [music]
[1:58:07] to [singing] honor
[1:58:11] you. [music]
[1:58:14] Lord, with all [music] my heart
[1:58:19] I worship you. [music]
[1:58:28] [music] And all I have [singing]
[1:58:31] within me, [music]

[1:58:42] And all [singing] that I adore,
[1:58:47] it [music] is in you.

[1:59:24] And Lord, I [singing] give you my heart.
[1:59:29] I give you my soul.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; I live for [singing] you alone.

[1:59:48] Lord have your way [singing] in me.
[1:59:53] I worship
[1:59:55] you.

[2:00:45] God. [music]
[2:00:47] There is none [singing] like you.
[2:00:53] I [music] worship

[2:00:59] [music] God.
[2:01:02] There is [singing] none like you.
[2:01:08] I worship [singing] you,
[2:01:11] oh prince of peace. [music]
[2:01:16] That is what I [singing] long to [music]
[2:01:21] do.

[2:10:03] um listening to the message today only
[2:10:06] uh a thought came to me and it says uh
[2:10:11] it takes a desire to be disciplined to
[2:10:13] listen to the word of God.
[2:10:16] Um and I also want to take the
[2:10:18] opportunity to announce that um sister
[2:10:19] Mel and I are expecting another baby
[2:10:21] soon. So
[2:10:23] just keep us in prayer. Uh those who
[2:10:27] have babies understand why I would ask
[2:10:28] for prayer. [laughter]
[2:10:31] So let us pray.
[2:10:33] Our heavenly father, we thank you for
[2:10:36] the greatness of your word. We thank you
[2:10:39] for washing us clean with your word
[2:10:41] today. Listening to that word just
[2:10:44] purifies our hearts and bless our soul.
[2:10:47] It gives us more than enough reassurance
[2:10:50] that you are God and you're with us all
[2:10:52] the way. You've shown us times and times
[2:10:56] and number again that clinging on to
[2:10:59] you, holding on to you is the only sure
[2:11:01] path to our redemption. We thank you for
[2:11:06] using a pastor to teach us more in
[2:11:07] depth, bringing [music] out
[2:11:12] more information, more things that we
[2:11:15] ought to know and hold on to. showing us
[2:11:17] a clearer path to worshiping you true,
[2:11:21] staying closer to the word, staying
[2:11:24] closer to you, oh Lord, and keeping your
[2:11:26] word true in our hearts.
[2:11:29] We thank you for the testimonies that
[2:11:30] fill this place. Every week there's
[2:11:33] something to testify about. We thank you
[2:11:35] for the testimonies, Sister Kimberly. We
[2:11:38] thank you, Lord, for you are watching
[2:11:39] over those in Jamaica. You are touching
[2:11:43] the hearts of many that are here today.
[2:11:45] We everyone has a desire, have their
[2:11:48] challenges and their struggles. But
[2:11:51] thank you oh Lord for you have conquered
[2:11:54] already. You said you have already
[2:11:55] overcame the devil. You have overcome
[2:11:58] for us. We do not need to fight another
[2:12:00] battle. We just have to hold on to your
[2:12:02] word and we are victorious as you have
[2:12:04] made us from the very beginning. We ask
[2:12:07] that this word continue to resonate in
[2:12:09] our hearts all week long day in day out
[2:12:12] morning to night. Let it continue to
[2:12:15] resonate with us and let us continue to
[2:12:17] stand on that authority that we already
[2:12:19] vict as we continue to cling on to you.
[2:12:23] The week is bright. Oh Lord, we ask for
[2:12:25] your guidance. Give us the wisdom to
[2:12:27] approach this week in your word. Give us
[2:12:29] the wisdom to do everything according to
[2:12:31] your word. Give us the wisdom to do
[2:12:33] things according to your purpose for us.
[2:12:37] Let our hearts be filled with discipline
[2:12:38] and let discipline be joyful to us.
[2:12:41] Lord, thank you for your word that we've
[2:12:43] heard today and thank you for the love
[2:12:45] that we share. Thank you for the family.
[2:12:46] Thank you for the for the church. And
