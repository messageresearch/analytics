bless you to receive it amen the same with the going forth of the word that he will bless our brother joe to to to give the word to share the word and he'll bless us to receive the word amen so that is not our brother's ministry will not be in vain amen but it will accomplish that which god pleases amen so we certainly welcome our brother joe adams and his wife amen so to newfoundland amen maybe they live in newfoundland because i think all of north america is newfoundland yeah because when they landed here of course that was it they got access to to all of north america so we thank the lord for that amen do god be the glory and we thank him for the bringing our brother here to minister to us and from the united states what's what's the state louisiana oh well praise the lord amen so uh i i think i've been to louisiana uh it's been quite a while ago now a number of years ago but again it was to because another brother from i think from canada was ministering down there in louisiana and not sure it might have been brother biscuit and that's many years ago so we pray the grace of god to the bride of christ in louisiana we pray the grace of god to the right of christ here as he sends a brother from louisiana to minister to us amen so we're going to turn the service over to our brother and i've encouraged him to take as long as he wants preach as god lays it upon his heart amen whatever god lays on his side oh yeah when it comes to the time our brother matthew again has removed the clock amen so we'll just we won't bother to look at our own so maybe someday brother matthew would be out there with something to to remove all of our watches amen so brother sister why because we're going from time to eternity by the grace of god so i pray the grace of god that eternity is going to have a greater and greater influence on us in the going forth of the word because brother it's the eternal word and it comes in the time to catch the seed of god the elect of god amen to take us back to eternity by the grace of god amen so this is all a part of god's plan of what god has ordained and predestinated amen to get us back home i trust you feel you're not going oh well we're going from here we're going over to this this other place we're going home amen so when we get there by the grace of god we're going to feel at home oh yes most heavily a right spirit a right attitude right motors right objectives oh everything oh oh yes we want to don't we want to have this whole flesh like it is to to fight against it or to fight against the flesh not by any means all those things will be gone and we will enter into that glorified body amen praise the lord we'll we will we will understand we're home amen right here we're fighting to get there but when we're there we won't be fighting to get here not by any means thank god and brother again through the going forth of the word the ministry of the word it's what god has ordained god has predestinated to keep us mindful of where we come from where we're going and how to get there amen by the grace of god amen so let's stand and we're going to sing only believe and turn to our brother joel for the ministry of the word so be in the spirit and we thank our brother jonathan carlette for his influence in bringing our brother here maybe yes we'll turn to brother brother john and he he'll uh he'll really truly introduce our brother joe amen praise the lord not joe coffee amen not by any means amen so we got we got joe we got joes and we know joe amen so we appreciate joe's ministry with the music of singing amen but not the ministry of the word amen praise the lord that the lord has called him to hear the word but not to minister the word amen so he's going to sing it amen by the grace of god but not preach it so the lord bless us amen let's sing only believe all things are possible we'll ask our brother jonathan to come and introduce our brother joe lord blesses only baby all thanks yes hallelujah praise the lord amen only believe oh only believe holy believe all things are possible only [Music] jesus is here jesus [Music] jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is now i believe as brother joe comes now i believe [Music] now i believe all things are possible now i believe now i believe now i believe [Music] [Applause] and then we just want to welcome brother joe formally to the platform he's been an evangelist for over 20 years working with brother tim pruitt down in louisiana i've shared some of the testimonies we've had with joe brother joe's ministry and this is one of those moments where i do believe anything is possible amen so come with your needs come with your faith raising amen come expecting and trust god to meet your need it doesn't matter what it is amen if the preacher is anointed and if you are pulling on the gift then god can answer your prayer he can answer your need amen all he's looking for is somebody they'll sit there and pull and pray and pull and pray until they get the answer amen god rewards diligence he rewards those that walk continuously seek his face amen and so tonight if you don't get what you're looking for tonight come looking for it tomorrow and if you don't get it tomorrow then come looking for it on sunday and if you don't get it then then come looking for wednesday and if you don't get it on wednesday then something is wrong amen amen amen but we want to trust believing amen we want to know that we're going to get what we come expecting don't tell god how to do it just say lord i have a need amen and then we let the preaching of the word meet our need amen so as we welcome brother joe let's just sing that song he is able more than able to accomplish what concerns me today he is [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] amen aren't you thankful that he's able in your own humanity there's disappointments there's failures but he's able he's able to take the clay and remold it time and time again because he knows what he wants that clay to look like let's just take these knees now or take let's just present this weekend these special meetings to the lord and then we'll just slide my nerves to settle here just a little bit father we do thank you god for this opportunity what a great opportunity lord that is afforded to each of us that are here tonight [Music] lord an opportunity to hear the word amen lord an opportunity to be able to deliver the word father to feed on the gift of god that you have placed in our midst in this hour lord we know that this message fathers for a special class of people and we're so thankful lord we've been been identified not by our own choosing but by your choosing lord and we know that this is not man's choosing man's election man's ordination but father this is all the work of the great i am and we're so thankful for this hour lord in which we can believe lord you call believers out lord of denominational systems and out of the world follow to believe this truth and we believe father somebody's going to perceive it somebody's going to believe in it somebody's going to act upon it and they're going to manifest this word father that's who we are tonight lord even at the far east of a continent lord there's believers that are set aside and they set aside a friday night to come and worship you and i just ask that you would speak lord god take me as a man and set me aside and may you just be the guest minister tonight may you speak lord through these lips and may you lord listen through the ears tonight and may you anoint lord every aspect of the service lord as the specials were sung just felt your anointing in the back office father believe that you're already here lord and we just want to give you the liberty to move tonight father may we not god put you in a box and say you only can move this far this way but lord may we be free tonight to allow the holy spirit to go as he would choose to move and choose to reign so we just commit this service lord these weekend meetings into your care probably place it into your hands tonight first in jesus name we ask amen amen well as you're standing we're just gonna i just want to send some greetings uh brother tim sends his greetings from back home to brother lush to actually brother john anderson blanca as well into the the coffee family i'm sure that encompasses all of you coffees brother bob walked in the back and i i didn't know who he was i'm like man you look like brother barry but i didn't know you john told me the pastor was going to come back then when brother mark came up like man that's barry junior plan this coffee's a strong strain it's got a strong uh emblems here so but we we we do greet you and we count it an honor to be here with you this weekend we know that there's a lot of effort that's been put out or put into these this weekend these meetings and of all the evangelists that you could choose to have you chose to call us to be a part many you may not know but just here last month i've gone full time in the ministry stepped away from the hospital i was a cfo in the hospital for the last five years been at the hospital for 24 but walked away from it people said well you're walking away i said i'm not walking away from anything i'm walking towards something else and so that's what we're here for we want to just put our shoulder to the wheel with the believers here and trust us something that uh would be said would just be a blessing to you and brother mark sister marine brother philip roncalli says can you please send my greetings to them he's actually streaming right now live so he just heard that so philip i took care of that for you amen amen we're going to turn our bibles here tonight can you hear me pretty good out there okay good amen we're going to look here in hebrews 11 and verse 1. this is a very very very for mature familiar scripture reading for all of us but i want to speak to you i've been on a series back home on god does impossible math and i want to speak to you tonight by the grace of god nothing will stand before your prayer now we're very familiar many of us are probably very familiar with what quote i'll be pulling from uh tomorrow night we'll be speaking if the lord willing will not even cancer so we're going to take this a little series this weekend to try to elevate your faith because we as a believer must realize nothing will stand before our prayer not even cancer so no matter what you're facing tonight no matter what you're facing tomorrow no matter what you're facing next week next month in time to terry next year nothing will stand before the believer's prayer how many of you are believers tonight then god's here to answer and god's here to meet your needs we find here in the bible says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for it or for by it the elders attain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear for by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch when he was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased god by faith it is impossible or excuse me but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by faith by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance he obeyed and went out not knowing where he went or whether he went by faith he's sojourn in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is god verse 11 through faith also sarah received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang evening of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promise but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embrace them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth god bless you you can have your seats this evening brother joe coffey where are you i'm sorry about that buddy all i can say is i'm sorry i agree with you well you know the bible says stay in the column where with your calls so but i just i just like wow wonderful so we know we're not expecting to hear from you tonight so we will let you sing and do anything else that you would like to tonight amen so we look here and this is like i said a very familiar scripture reading and we're going to look at it from the aspect of faith and i want to build the foundation tonight uh we may not have anything special going on after service tonight it may wait till tomorrow evening after i finish tomorrow evening service but just kind of take this scripture tonight and take the the uh the word that we've just read and kind of lay the foundation a lot of times we get in our minds sometimes when we read about these great men and these great women of the bible especially when you read through hebrews 11 and you see all the things that they've done and we think man these are super human beings you read about i was like man they didn't have any trials they didn't have any struggles life must have been great life must have been grand or they just must have been special supernatural people right you know anyway that's how i read the bible sometimes like wow these people are amazing but you know what that's not the case there is as much human as we are tonight every one of those that we just read about they had their ups they had their downs they had they got sick they had their backaches they had headaches some of them got arthritis they had heart trouble they had all the same things that you and i deal with even up here in newfoundland canada you know they had their disappointments they had times where things were going great then they had times where they dipped into a valley and things wasn't going so great but as we realize in this portion of scripture nowhere does it mention anything about their mistakes nowhere does it mention anything about their failures we don't read anything about their disappointments see but the bible says they all died in faith they wasn't giving credence to the things that they suffered they weren't giving credence and voice to the things that they went through they all died in faith notice they didn't die of faithless people they didn't let their trial overcome them they wasn't overcome by their situation no they all died believing they all died persuaded they saw the promise and they were destined to make the promise but tom didn't allow them to reach the promise but they embraced the promise as having already seen it and i think i'm looking at other sons of abraham tonight daughters of abraham tonight we have seen the promise of god not only have we seen it but we as a people we've embraced it tonight we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we're headed back to and we had to realize that the things that we go through in this life these things don't define who we are because we've already been defined by the heavenly father so i'm glad tonight to know when i take my last breath god is not looking at my failures god is not looking at my humanity he's not looking at where i may be gassed on the car a little too much here or a little bit this way here and allow my humanity to get in the way and i stumble up out god is looking for one thing brother sister he's looking at does he have faith did he obey my word did he admire adhere to the promises of god was he hanging on to it did he embrace the promise of god did he embrace the opening of the word did he embrace the open of the seventh seal or did he just put it aside i'm glad to know tonight that god is not looking at my failures god is looking at my faith tonight and that's what he's looking there for you and we find in the scripture it says that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen now faith this word faith means a firm persuasion it's a firm persuasion means you can't be moved you got faith and the word substance here means a foundation so a firm foundation amen the the faith is a firm foundation of things hoped for but it's the evidence that word evidence is proof it's to prove whether you feel it whether you see it whether you're anything it doesn't matter you got the proof because why you got faith amen now i understand the prophet of god will tell us faith is not something that you work up faith is something that you have can everybody say amen tonight you mean brother joe i don't have to work this up not tonight maybe if you're a pentecostal you go to pentecostal church you may have to work it up a little bit but not tonight because see faith is not something that you work up faith is something that you have amen come on church amen tonight i got faith even when i don't feel like it i got it prohibited says now faith being the substance and there we find out in hebrews what faith was and what those did who had faith see there's many times that people have had faith today and tomorrow they haven't got it and the next day there's something and then there's something else but when god wants anchors to get this point when god once anchors it and you see it there's nothing ever going to move you from it amen oh hallelujah man when god god anchors out in your heart that you're going to be healed are you going to be delivered or that prayer that you've been praying that you've been asking god for when it anchors in your heart and you finally see it you finally embrace it he says there's nothing ever going to move you from it what are you saying brother joe i'm telling you tonight as a son as a daughter of god nothing will stand before your prayer because you recognize who you are you recognize i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i'm a child of abraham i'm the royal seed tonight and if nothing could stand before my father abraham then nothing can stand before me because i'm his child notice now what he says he goes you're just poking reaching pursuing and pursuing his adventure without authority see you're just trying this and you're just trying that and going this way and right here right there you haven't got faith yet but when see there it is church but when you know we have all had been in times where we poked we pursued we've hoped we tried this and we tried that hoping it was going to be the special key that unlocks the door to a happy life only to be disappointed all right maybe i'm just preaching maybe hey do i got louisiana friends on tonight you know brother brown will tell us this body is controlled by five senses see taste smell hear touch five senses controls this body you know somebody slaps you in the face that super sense just sometimes it just kind of pushes to the back for a minute and there's another sense that rises up because you just been touched not by an angel but you know think about this you know sometimes you can smell different smells and it brings you back to something as a child or you hear a hearse something a song or something and it takes you back to a fond memory or it could even take you back to maybe a tragic memory so this body of ours is controlled and sometimes we allow the things that we see taste smell feel and touch control our attitude and dictate how we come to the house of god you wait till sunday morning he don't believe me especially when you got children brother joe i see you holding a baby there oh the devil will love nothing more than on sunday morning to get the husband and wife kind of going at it a little bit on the way to church because the baby won't stop crying i remember one of my first evangelist preaching trips we just had a little child uh brother uh i don't forgot his name that's sad ain't it john yeah man i'm getting old brother john's sister blocker they know us that we have you know we have four children and lauren is my oldest she's now 19 but this is when she was a little bitty baby and she had a little pacifier that we just chose to leave that thing at home we're gonna be super parents that weekend and we're on a six-hour trip and this child cried the entire time i didn't want to preach no i wanted to get that kid out of my car i'm like honey don't you ever ever ever ever leave home that's better than a visa don't leave home without it that kid cried and cried and that had me so out of source i wasn't ready to preach you know and sometimes we allow our senses we allow the things that we go through the difficulties to rub us the wrong way and to do these things but brother brown will tell us that he says that none of these see taste smell fill and hear and touch none of these declare faith he said faith is the sixth sense known to some he would say as mental telepathy he says but see faith it's above all the five senses of the human body see faith is the only direct and positive sense it's the sixth sense faith is more than sight faith is more than feeling you don't feel faith you don't taste faith you don't smell faith you don't see faith faith is the substance and the word there is foundation so faith is the foundation of things hoped for and the evidence are the proof of things not seen amen so faith is something that you have and you have it alone i can't give you my faith you can't give me your faith see now there's times that we feel like well brother joe i don't have faith how many ever felt that okay good well i got a scripture for you we find here in romans 12 and verse 3 we'll read the latter part of it god had dealt to every man the measure of faith so when the devil comes whispering in your ears you don't have faith you said devil you're a liar because the word just says that i got it now the god had dealt to every man a measure of faith and brother brown will tell us now i know that many of us don't have faith and i don't have faith to make all the promises come true or come to pass but i sure wouldn't stand in the way of somebody that did have that kind of faith he goes i often wish that i had the faith like in it to go out on a little walk on an afternoon stroll and just to walk on up yonder and never come back you know that's the kind of faith that that we all would like but you know what if we don't have that kind of faith don't stand in the way of somebody else that does have that kind of thing but we find there's a spirit of jealousy to try to get among the people when they see somebody with a supernatural faith or faith to really dig in and grab hold of it they become jealous because they're not where that person is but don't worry brother sister god has given every man a measure of faith you may not be where they are yet but you don't know the trials that got them to that point and i'm going to change that god will get you there if you keep on the straightener if you keep trusting god if you keep believing god god will show you that he is a living god he's not some dead god he's not some get a son dead dead of some denomination but he's a living god working in his people notice now god has given every one of us a measure of faith so there's not one of you sitting here right now whether you're old whether you're young who lacks faith so that excuse can be thrown out we all have faith some of you have more faith than others and some of you has less faith than some you know that even an atheist has faith you might if i take my jacket off do y'all preach with your jacket owner off there's a hook that means you preach with it off i'll take that he's been teaching me to hook all day so we fine notice now to be an atheist you've got to have faith how many atheists do i have here tonight so be an atheist to be an atheist this is what you got to believe that nothing produced everything that we have today that nothing produced everything well you got to have some strong faith for that that non-life produce life now gather fathom that one for a minute non-life produce life that randomness produced precision and that chaos produced order i'm sorry but i'm just gonna believe there's a god i don't have that kind of faith i got faith but i don't have atheist type faith they got strong faith but you see faith is brotherhood says faith isn't it's not something that you work up to but it's something that you have he says now if i was starving and i was going to die of starvation and a loaf of bread saved my life and the purchase of the loaf of bread was 25 cents and somebody gave me 25 cents he says now he goes just as much as i can see he goes and i know that i hold the 25 cents which is the buying power of the loaf of bread i can be just as happy with the 25 cents as i could be with the loaf of bread oh i don't think y'all got that i can be just as happy with the 25 cents as i could be if i had the loaf of bread no that you still ain't catching it i could be just as happy with the 25 cents if i had the loaf of bread if i gave you brother john you were dying of starvation thank god you're not and i gave you 25 cents and you knew that 25 cents was going to buy you enough bread to take care of your family and you went down to the store and the store was closed but that you knew the store was going to open at some point it had to open because behind the doors behind the glass there was brand in there and you knew in your hand was the purchasing power of that bread and inside behind that door it laid the power to keep your family up what would you do you wouldn't just back away and go home you would stay there until the door open what am i telling you church with the purchasing power that you have in your hand faith it'll open that door if you'll just wait long enough you'll get there look we're we're purchasing power you know you'll be healed with purchasing power you know you'll be delivered we're purchasing power tonight you know you'll overcome we're purchasing power to like you know that you're going to receive the holy ghost with the purchase power tonight you know that your body will be changed and you'll go in the rapture cause you got it you got it not that you worked up to it god gave it to you the purchase power he gave you the 25 cents he gave you the faith needed to wait long enough for those doors to open and to go in and pick out exactly what you have need of see with faith you can do all things with faith nothing is impossible see god dealt to every one of us the right measure of purchasing power some of you need more than 25 cents and he's given it to you some of you all you need is 25 cents and it's perfect for the situation so whatever you're going through god has given you the faith needed to persevere to overcome and to be victorious god has done it no man has done this and brother brown will tell us in confirmation and evidence he said faith isn't a myth a myth it is an imagination he said it's a substance and anything that's a substance isn't a myth it's something that you actually get a hold of and that's what faith is he says there is where so many people fail to get it they have a hope instead of faith you hope that you will now there's times in our life we prayed but we pray from a hopeful standpoint and not from the standpoint of faith god please you hear people please you we don't have to beg god the believer should never ask god please we're not and he's not a god to where he's giving out food to beggars though he does we're not beggars we're sons and daughters of god the bible tells us we should come to god boldly we don't have to come begging we're not servants we're his children he goes notice now he says they have a hope instead of faith you hope you will you kind of have an imaginary faith because that you feel that well you've appropriated that he goes but when actually you've got a hold of faith it's a substance it's something real then you hold that and that's what brings it when you've got faith that's what brings it so now we find god give is every given every man a measure of faith we look here in second corinthians 10 i'm going to go here for a few minutes tonight and we're going to look well does the faith that i get does it always maintain at that level because sometimes some of us are at greater faith than others some of us are less faith than most but we find through the scripture here in second corinthians 10 and verse 12 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that condem that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise but we were not boasting things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god had distributed to us notice he's given us this right a measure to reach even unto you what is that he's given us faith for we stretched not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as you also in the preaching of the gospel of christ not boasting of things without our measure that is of other men's labors but having hope when your faith is increased so i want to focus there for a minute your faith doesn't have to maintain at the con the present condition that it's set but our faith can be increased so not only does god give you faith but not he allows that faith to grow he allows that faith to to uh to flourish we know there's been times you've you've prayed for people or you've seen different ones that you pray for they may need healing in the body or direction for a job or deliver from from some kind of spirit and when god comes down and meets that need and you know it and you've been in prayer for it and god does it the way that you ask what does it do it doesn't diminish your faith no it builds your faith it increases your faith to trust god more trust god for your trial trust god for your situation when you see god do it for others when we hear of a testimony of how god moved in a supernatural way for a believer that doesn't decrease our faith it increases our faith so brother man will say faith has great big muscles and hair on his chest now i like to go to the gym i like to work out i've actually i did that today and it felt good but when i first started working out man i ate it hurt that lactic acid went all over my body and it just tore me apart i had little wimpy arms you know because that's when it starts you start wimpy and that's kind of how our faith is it starts wimpy so what are you saying brother joe for somebody to be a bodybuilder get into the gym and have great big muscles he doesn't just haphazardly eat anything that he wants he has to eat certain foods be on a certain diet he goes to the gym and he learns what workouts to do how to do the workout what motion to perform to work on that certain muscle to make sure that you're not pulling with another aspect of the muscle but you're using that muscle because that's the muscle you're working and he doesn't notice he goes day after day after day after day and when he's a far different pitcher from when he started to where he is if he's been on it day after day after day so what i'm telling you is for this man to get to that point he knows what muscles to to work out to to reach the maximum potential and he does this day after day after day and if our faith muscles are going to increase then guess what they got to be exercised they have to be exercised you have to go to work on those faith muscles but i want you to know don't worry there's a free gym for every one of you to go to it's god's gym of hard knocks trials and tribulations and it's open 24 7. you don't have to pay for it there's no special pass he's given it to every one of you you want more faith god is going to open the door for you he says come on in it's 24 7 access here we got all the machines you need amen oh i don't know if i want faith now and i when i first got saved which was 20-plus years ago you know i i was a young cocky young 24 or 20 something year old man and thought i had the world by the horns and i you know i pray lord i need some patience that was the last time i ever prayed for patience it only took one time god he heard my prayer and he said all right oh boy we're going to pour this on you i realized right then that was the most stupidest prayer i think i've ever prayed in all my life but we find that for our our faith to increase we have to work at it that's where god's going to put you in places god's going to put you in situations to where that he can he can work on now some of you young people your faith you're not going to go through the trials that your parents would go through different stages of life different muscle development god is teaching you guys showing you there's things there may be some you know some of you young girls you know how it is there's drama with girls right i got three girls i know all about the drama well this one said this when did someone didn't talk to me i'm like oh my goodness john you're lucky you only got one man we got one and one of them as a drama queen i mean something ain't going her way you know it she's her daddy made over but we find there's different levels of faith and we're all on a different level but god is here and god doesn't want your faith to diminish god wants your faith to grow and so how do we get faith in luke 18 and verse 8 it says i tell you thee that he will avenge him speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on earth he's looking for one thing he's looking for somebody that'll believe he's looking for a young person that'll believe he's looking for a middle-aged person that'll believe he's looking for an older person no matter how long you've been in a way you still believe amen well brother joe why do i need faith why do i need what is so what's the big deal about faith because with faith all things are possible without faith nothing is possible amen with faith all things are possible so god is looking for faith he's looking for those that have it he doesn't want your faith to diminish he doesn't want to wither up he wants you to believe him he wants you to trust him he wants you to obey him he wants you to have confidence in him and he wants you to have confidence in his word and he wants you to have confidence in the direction that he has for your life a lot of times we find ourselves we're human right we have our own mind and we have our own will but we learn as we give our will over to his will then his will can be performed in our life and the greatest struggle even the struggle in gethsemane was god's will or jesus's will against the father nevertheless not my will be done but your will be done he had to surrender his will to give it over to the father so that it could accomplish that which it was purpose and so god is wanting he's looking for somebody today that will have confidence that wherever he leads you you're willing to follow can i just share something with you that's personal as i was sharing with brother john switzer blanca earlier i just left the hospital after 24 years i've been there i worked my way up from staff accountant to a controller from controller to the cfo and my aspirations and my vision or my dreams when i was going to be the ceo of this hospital i was going to work my way all the way through it you know it never had been done before at least at that hospital and i was there i was on the cutting edge i was second in command and we find that things got rough and i've been praying for some years probably four or five years to whether to go full time in the ministry or not and just never got that open door never got that open door but you just got to keep knocking you don't give up because god has a timing for everything remember 25 cents i sat there until the door opened and so i've been praying and been praying and been praying and and i had another opportunity to go to another hospital company because things at the hospital just went where they need to be and i don't have to go into all the details with that but because they wasn't where they needed to be i began to entertain other offers and had a two very lucrative offers on the table went to the pastor and said look this is what we got it's not ideal but it'll work for the short term he's absolutely not absolutely not and so at that point brother tim our pastor asked me to come full time in the ministry i'm like wow i didn't expect that you know i've been knocking on the door for four or five years but it didn't come my way man i thought it was going to be great it was going to be a firework show or something right man i'm going full time but it was in the back office very simple very subtle but joe we understand you're not happy we'd like for you to come on full time in the ministry praise it pray about it and so we talked that was on a wednesday and on the thursday we decided we were going to do it was going to go in the following monday morning which would have been march 21st give our resignation many of you may know brother andrew spencer brother andrew spencer was at the oklahoma camp we were on our way to oklahoma camp on that thursday where all this came to light we're going to go full time we made our decision we're going full time in the ministry and i'm talking about faith okay because faith is the foundation of everything we stand for okay you got to have faith that god said a prophet you got to have faith that this mystery has been revealed so it all hinges on faith and that's why we're focusing tonight on faith and so anyway brother andrew was preaching to 250 young people and at the end of his service he doesn't know anything about me about my situation about my conversation with brother tim on wednesday about our conversation again on thursday he knows anything about that at the end towards the end of the service he points back he said god will not waste your pain brother joe he said god will be your financial advisor god will take care of you when man don't want to take care of you he goes oh they can't stop brother joe they can't stop sister jessica he goes don't worry about your future and i've been worried about my future for the next for the previous two days i was in a struggle he said don't worry about your future it's clear oh what happened i got 25 cents and the door finally opened oh i didn't have to worry i didn't have to question it any longer i knew right then this is what god had ordained us to do and let me tell you when you walk away from that kind of deal and you think people and you're right let me just go ahead and tell you my mom i told her i said mom i said you know i i um i'll resign the hospital today are you sick well john's to comment i got are you sick people think you're out of your head you're walking away from this prestigious child you're the cfo of the hospital you made great money i'm not walking away from anything church i'm walking towards something we got an eternal promise we got a goal out there the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few and god is calling sons and daughters to get out in the field and work into this until he comes and that's what we're doing that's why we're here tonight so that we can do what read songs from the harvest because god is calling the people come up higher this ain't your earth bound place we're not meant to be here god has told us to greater things and greater heights and deeper depth of the word of god [Music] but we got to have faith now any man in his right mind would have said ain't no way i'm taking that pay cut there's no way that's the most stupidest thing i've ever heard but i've been longing for it it doesn't make sense even until this day but i can tell you what a month and a half in i've not been disappointed god has provided and continue to provide and continue to provide but we find now faith comes by hearing now you said i could take my time tonight so i'm taking my time if that's all right romans 10 and verse 17 so then faith cometh by him so we find now every man has got a measure of faith your faith can be increased so how do we get that faith we get it by hearing the word of god amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god he provided more than twelve hundred sermons to increase your faith he's provided a five-fold ministry to increase your faith notice it's imperative that we're hearing the right things it's imperative that we're feeding on the right things we don't need to go look up believe the sign mess that's not our ministry that's not our calling our calling is to believe not disbelief our calling is to take god in his word our call is not to get all caught up in what everybody else is doing let them men they want a fuss they want to throw dirt let them thrust let them throw dirt we're here to believe because god has sent us a messenger in this hour and we're getting our our shoulders with that message and we're preaching the word we're keeping it pure we're not allowing men's ideas to intertwine into the message and entertain into the ministry no we want the pure word of god to be manifested and displayed so then and only then can they get the results [Music] many years ago sister blanca was dealing with a stomach issue and i preached faith and god spoke and god dealt with her and took care of that stomach issue and i believe you've ever had it since god gallbladder see god still moves amen costume moves he responds to faith that's god he responds to faith so we've got to be feeding on the right thing when you find yourself church in a difficult situation how many have ever been in a difficult situation maybe three or four y'all rest y'all cherubs right brother gerald you didn't know you got a bunch of angels here or maybe you didn't know you find yourself in a difficult situation or in a battle for your health the last thing listen to me now the last thing that you need to do is surround yourself with negative people oh my goodness here comes so-and-so i'm gonna hear that same story over and over and over again and you just want to beat your head because you're like i done got myself in a trap and there ain't no way out thank god there's text messaging today so you can send a quick text call me and get me out of this situation now i've never used that yet but i'm hey i'm not opposed to it but we find negativity breeds doubt and negativity breeds unbelief and you can never rise up and take a promise of god with a negative confession see doubt and unbelief will never take hold of the promises of god never take hold of the promises of god they will keep the promises just out of your reach we've always heard the story about a carrot hanging out there you know and that's the way doubts and unbelief are you believe in the back of your mind but it's just doubt gets out there and unbelief is out there and you're just chasing after just so close you want to believe but it's just a carrot you never get to partake of it because doubt cause unbelief see you may have faith for somebody else and a lot of us do it's easier to believe for somebody else than it is to believe when it comes to your home oh i believe god can i believe god will i believe god can do it for you yes i believe that we're going to be praying for you however many prayed that prayer oh yeah bless god man we go to war we go to battle we pray every night for that but you let it come to your house oh oh god you did it for them but i'm not sure if you'll do it for me don't allow negativity to come into your house you need to surround yourself with people that'll lift you up you need to surround yourself with people that will encourage you you need to be around those that will be praying for you not a two-minute prayer but i'm talking about they go to god they go to the throne of heaven on your behalf none of us when we're in our trials when we're in our weak moments we don't need frizz like job had well you're just a secret sinner if you just confess that you'll be all right no what we need we need a caleb and we need a joshua [Music] what do you mean we need a caleb and a joshua they knew there was giants in the land they knew there was wall cities in the land but they looked beyond the wall city they look beyond the situation and they said we're more than able that's what i want around me i don't want the naysayers the negative nancy i want sons and daughters of god that'll get behind me and say we're praying for you brother joe we're believing for you we know god is there we know god is going to move don't you worry about it we're praying and god is going to answer that prayer why because we got 25 cents in our hands amen but says now your faith is what saves you romans 10 and verse 14 how then shall they call on him who they have not believed so going back to how faith is received is through hearing of the word of god how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher god has ordained a preaching ministry to bring forth the word of god we find today though that men want to reorganize the way god has established his program who are we to say that we got it figured out and god can't figure it out god put it in his word a certain way we don't need to go manhandling that word and changing it up trying to dictate and push laws out there you got to do it this way or you don't have it but you find ministry today if you don't get my sermons you don't get my sermons you're not bribed you're not going to make it who are you no god has ordained a fifo ministry and faith cometh by preaching and how shall they hear but what without a preacher be sent and we find hereforth the preaching of the cross is to them this is in first corinthians 1 and verse 18 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god amen so for it is written i will destroy the wisdom otherwise i will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudence where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made a foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe so your faith is what saves you amen see we establish we accept that faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word and it takes a preacher and so we're not putting all our focus and all our confidence in the man no because man i fail you and i'm afraid that's what many people have done they elevated the man to a place where he can't fall they put him in a position that god never intended man to be put in but yet we are to put our faith in the word of god we are to put our faith in what the man is preaching is he preaching the truth if he's preaching the truth amen respond to it if he's not preaching the truth get away from it but we find because man has been elevated to a certain plateau a certain position that people just believe it no matter what and they're not able to discern the two spirits within the framework of the christian church because they elevated the man and not the word the word should always be elevated over the man so what good is faith with faith you can be healed did y'all hear that i know y'all got a better amen than that in you with faith you can be healed with faith you can be delivered with faith you can be set free with faith you can overcome with faith you'll take a rapture but with unbelief you'll go to hell or at best you go in the tribulation period right so why do you want to settle for unbelief when god has given us so much so we have seen the supernatural manifest over and over and over again bible days are here because the living god is present among us bill brown says now divine healing is nothing that anyone can do divine healing is an act of faith in the finished work and it's your personal faith in the finished work of christ at calvary that brings both salvation and healing so it's your personal faith brother john as much as i love you and you're a dear friend of mine your faith is not going to do anything for me it will but it won't if you understand what i'm saying because my i have to have faith in that it's for me that it's personal to me god i believe that you know brother man says in the message perfect faith god can use my faith to heal you i believe that but we also have to look at the office by which he was ministering from because that was a a high office of a high priest he was doing things and going things and he said i believe god can use my faith because he's seen so many supernatural things take place and he said i believe god can use my faith to elevate your faith to a point to receive the healing and i believe god uses men today like jewel foreign and different ones who have seen the supernatural who are are bulldogs of faith and they go out there and they they hold on to it and they they refuse to let go of it and what do you find you find god responds you find there they stay at that door because they had the 25 cents the purchase power of the hand and they stay there until they're able to get into it and when they get into it they begin to feast on the word they begin to feast on the promises of god this is what i've been waiting for the door the promise to come open and i'm going in with my faith i'm going in with the purchase power and god will not withhold any good thing to them that walk upright so it's your personal faith in the finished work of calvary that brings both salvation and healing he goes now he says then your personal faith this is then can we see jesus in that finished work draws the remuneration from what he did for you at calvary your personal faith so so you were saved 2 000 years ago but you accepted your salvation 25 years ago five hours ago five minutes ago see you were healed two thousand years ago you can accept it right now i mean it's based on your faith and we find here we're still working with faith ephesians 2 and verse say if your turn there i never started my time or so y'all got all that for free that was all free we just started we got a little over an hour to go the bible says here in ephesians 2 and verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves but it is a gift to god not a works lest any man should boast so it's by grace that we are saved but it's through faith and notice god doesn't need your works oh i did so and so and i did so and so and i did so and so and he said to those well we did this and we did this and we did this he goes depart from me i never knew you see because they did it all with the wrong motive they did it all based on works trying to work their self up work their faith up but yet he says here for by grace are you saved and it's through faith not of yourself it's a gift of god so not only do we have faith not only can our faith increase not only do we understand that it comes through the preaching of the word but not only that but it's a gift of god god has given every one of us that free gift of faith so even the atheist tonight has faith but it's what you do with that faith that brings the results or not it's how you point that faith do you direct that faith toward the word toward the promise of god or do you direct that faith toward the world and all your ambition and all your driving all your desires are going toward the world you can be successful but you're turning away from eternal life but see it's your faith you believe i can reach this see it's misguided faith misappropriated faith but yet every one of us has it's a gift from god so with faith nothing is impossible no situation is impossible if you got faith no sickness is impossible tonight if you got faith no trial is impossible tonight if you got faith no loss of a loved one will will condemn your will would distract you if you've got faith no complex tonight will defeat you if you have faith the brother man will tell us at that word he says now only by your confession can you be saved so only by your confession that's the most powerful weapon that god put in the hand of a man is committal and a confession oh my lord brother joe i'm just a young person man but if you commit your life to god and you make your confession on a daily basis i'm a child of god god done something for me in that service or god something's done for me at camp god done something god done something he said the most powerful weapon that god put in the hand of a man is committal in a confession he goes it'll do it every time if you'll believe it accept it on those bases and believe it and stay with it keep confessing it and he goes look because you know when a lot of people look at symptoms they always look around well i don't feel any better how many ever heard people say that i hope it ain't nobody in this church because you're a small church but you know you remember i'm just going to back off with that one so what you find people they always looking at symptoms he says well i don't feel any better that doesn't have one thing to do with it it's what you believe not how you feel oh my we could get the christian church if we could get the bride of christ to get their minds off of how they feel and what they're seeing and all the difficulties around them and realize you're in the gym called faith and god has got you there and he's exercising those faith both it's not how you feel it's not what you're looking at it's what you believe tonight and if you believe this is the word of god god will back it up every time god will not let you hold on to this word and get you at the following and you'd be disappointed he never provide no god will answer god will respond because god will reward those that diligently seek after him that's the word of god that's the promise of god god has to obey his own word or he has to to adhere to his own word he says now we're talking about a negative conversation or a negative attitude or a negative uh confession he says now all of you here that's saved tonight won't you just raise your hand up hold on i don't have the whole church we're gonna have to have a prayer line right now he says all of you in here that are saved tonight just get in your head if you just got in your head that you're not saved and you go around saying well i'm not saying no more he goes you're not saved do you see how simple that was you get in your head the devil get in your head said you're not saying and you go confess and i'm not saved anymore he says you're not saved he says you're backslid whenever you do that see you've got to have your testimony and your confession positive not according to my feelings but according to what he said that's it he said there's not a christian in here no matter how solid you are in faith if right now that you something happened to get a hold of you and tell you that you're not a christian and you start out testifying well i'm not a christian no more he goes you dropped right you're no more a christian anymore as soon as you testify that you're not a christian then you drop from grace right then you've fallen because why your own speech tells what you are your own speech tells what you are now i understand many of us we're human right we're not the super human christians that we read about in in hebrews 11. but over human in earth's times the devil comes and whispers into your ear you ain't got it you're this and that and if you're not careful we start giving credence to the lies but as long as your confession is i'm saved i'm healed i'm filled with the holy ghost satan is defeated but as soon as you confess that you're no longer saved you're not saved as soon as you confess that you're not healed you're not healed you walk away from it you lose your healing there's a little kid or people that will come up on a platform in a prayer line they'd come up and god would miraculously heal them and before they walked off they were back in the same position they were before they walked up it wasn't anything to do with the prophet wasn't anything to do with god it wasn't anything to do with the word it was their lack of faith to hold on to it he said your faith can save you because it'll hold you right now it can hold you for the next five minutes it can hold you for the next five years it can hold you into eternity it's based on your faith amen he says now when you confess that the holy ghost is it for you you'll never receive the holy ghost but notice it doesn't have to be with your lips it can be with your body language you come in preach me happy preacher well get ready you ain't getting nothing you got to start putting in putting in putting in believing you know i learned a lesson because we done a lot of leadership training they said you never fold your arms in a meeting because when you fold your arms you know what this is a sign of you can't reach me i'm not listening brother mark to anything you're saying i got my heart folded so they teach you to stand with your hands like this open because your posture your body language in church says a lot about what you're getting out of church you can come and you can or you can you know you do all kind of things satan is there he's in every sin he's more faithful than many of us christians so but we can deny the word and we can deny our faith by not just our lips but with our body language i'm not saying you need to all be jumping around like a bunch of jumping beans but have a have a a stance a position of worship however that is some of you may never jump but it may be just man your intent you're plugged in you're right there your eyes are locked in your focus i've been to churches where there's you can hardly squeak and amen but when you call for something at the end of the service the entire church lines up but see because it's a different type of people different type of atmosphere but they're locked in they're believing they're receiving so you want to maintain a positive confession so that the word can work in your life it can work in your home it can work in your marriage it can work in your children when you're facing a situation you need to speak the word over that situation don't speak the devil's lie with that situation speak the word of promise be positive have a positive confession he says now many people or some people he says you know he some people would say healing is not brother says now healing is not something you say well you know i believe it you know you're trying to get somebody well i just i think i can believe it that's all right you know he says now if that's the best you can do just mentally now notice that here's a prophet of god telling you how to work it from a mental standpoint to get it to where you believe are y'all with me that's okay tonight i'm not much of a teacher but i'm doing everything i can to get you there he says now if it's just well you know you you some see some people they're kind of half past well you know i believe that i can believe that he said but if it's all just mental he goes you say it you gotta believe it you gotta accept it then if you accept it on those bases just well yeah i can believe it he says say it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying it i'm healed i'm healed and maybe you don't really believe it yet but you just keep saying i'm healed i'm healed say it until you actually believe it and when you believe it then it's going to take place you're not lying that you don't believe it no you're saying it over and over because sometimes some of us are at a very low level of faith and we're trying to elevate our faith up there to a higher place and brother said if it's only mental he says just say it over and over say it over and over say i'm healed say i'm delivered say i got the holy oath say it over and over until you finally believe it and then when you finally believe it then it takes place then healing is your portion then deliverance is coming to your home then you receive the holy ghost because why he went from mental to faith and god will honor faith every time so it's okay sometimes we struggle because the battle is the mind that's the battleground and the problem of god said satan chose the mind god chose the heart so that's sometimes that's why we got to say it over and over and over to get it into our mind i believe it i believe it i believe it but when it finally drops down into the heart oh glory to god when it drops down into the heart ain't no devil hell can stand against it it's no longer a mental concession it's a reality of a living god say it over till you believe it say it over till it drops down in your heart when it anchors in there ain't no devil health can come in there oh glory to god you find people come up for prayer well i just i need the assurance say it over and over till you believe it you know it's okay to have the ministry pray for you it's okay to have the preachers pray for you but the preachers didn't make the promise god made the promise say it over say it over say it over until you finally believe it until you finally believe it i'm not opposed to praying for you i'm not approached opposed to laying hands on you but you got to believe the promise it's got to be your promise it's got to be you and god had come into an intimate relationship and he's become your savior he's become your healer he's become your deliverer he's become everything to you because you believe because he's given you faith to believe say it over and over and over and over notice he's telling you say it over say it over hebrews 3 and 1 says wherefore holy brother partakers of the heavenly calling considered the apostle and the high priest of our profession christ jesus what is he that word profession means acknowledgement or it means confession he's brother says now in the message except god's gift he says you'll never live above your confession so why is he telling you say it over and over because it's your confession he wants you to believe it and if you say it over and over you're making a positive confession lord i believe it though you don't believe but god help my all my unbelief let me believe tonight lord i'm going to say it over and over and over because you're a high priest of my confession and i'm going to confess that you're a healer i'm going to confess that you're a savior i'm going to confess the holy ghost from my family i'm going to confess it in my church i'm going to confess it for the people he's a high priest of our confession and he said he can't do nothing for you until you first confess that he's done it oh i know look we struggle sometimes but i'll tell you the prophet of god has given us instruction just say it over because he can't do nothing for you but what you confess first that it's done god thank you god i look i've got kiss and i'm praying god feel every last one i'm with the holy ghost god and i keep praying my wife and i we're praying over and over because you know as a parent you see things oh they're not bad kids but they're kids but we want more we want our kids built with the holy ghost we want our kids walking in victory we want our kids walking free from the desires of this world so we're confessing it over and over like get ahold of my son get a hold of my daughters get a hold of them lord may they walk in the values of god may they walk in the promises of god but the things of this world fall off of them lord we're confessing we're saying oh we may be not seeing the results yet but we have a positive confession this all right one time brother bam says this is in the eagle service's nest many of you probably are familiar with this one a man one time was trying to seek god and every time he'd say i'm safe the devil will say no you're not no you're not one day he drove down a stake he says satan from this on i'll point to this state this is the place where i met god's requirements right here now for you even like fellowship this could be that steak tonight this could be the state driving service where i met god's requirements right here right here tonight on a friday night the start of these meetings i met god's requirements i'm dry brother says you drive a steak down right beside your seat this afternoon saying satan right here is where i'm every doubt's gonna lay i'm gonna fly away with him this afternoon i'm going to accept exactly what he told me that he could do and i'll he goes in he says now if you just believe that tonight some of you tonight i know you've been in the way a long time i know you're here and you sometimes you you feel a million miles from everybody but drive a stake down this afternoon god this is where i met your requirement satan i'm gonna point you back to this service i'm going to put you back to this weekend i'm going to punch you back to this time where god met my prayer senior come along you know he'll come and he'll tell you that you really wasn't saying it after all you're just going through the motions he'll say oh well you know i don't think any god did anything from me louisiana camp he just got all excited because there's a lot of excitement louisiana camp right all the motion i can tell you there's more excitement there's more than excitement at louisiana camp when you go hand-to-hand face-to-face combat to combat with a devil an evil spirit it's more than emotion you better know where you stand when you go to battle against those satanic spirits notice now the devil will try to do everything and anything on earth to rob your soul from eternal life that's his business your business is to drive a stake your business your job tonight is to drive the stake down satan not today not tomorrow not ever see when god saves you drive a stake down god fill you with the holy ghost drive the stake down god healed you tonight drive your stake down the devil's going to howl he's going to raise but you stand firm i'm saved he goes i'm saved i've witnessed that i pass from death into life the enemy may come in like a blood but you got to promise tonight that god's going to raise the standard why because you drove a stake down and can't no devil back you off of that see the devil does everything in his satanic power to draw people from god to wreck the faith that they have but see god has given us oh god has given you the word god has given you a new birth god has put something in your heart all that god requires you is the whole fast have faith in what he's doing god is moving god is working god is doing it and god only expects you to do one thing and that's drive to stay down tonight don't let this be just another servant don't let this be just another meeting let this be a state driving meeting this term here drive a stake originated in the native americas the native american term says when they were under attack and it looked like they were going to be defeated they would drive a stake in the ground and actually tie the person by their leg to that stake and they would have to stand there and defend that piece of ground to the death tie their leg to that stake what were they saying we're willing to die on this piece of ground we're willing to die right here tonight on this piece of ground and i said the prophet of god said someone you need to drive your stake down this afternoon what is he saying some of you need to say i'm tying myself no matter what i do no matter what i'm willing to die right here on this promise of god god you promise that you're my healer i'm driving that stake down tonight i'm not backing up or i may make advancement but i'm not going beyond this state i'm driving a stake down and if i make advancements god i'm going to drive another stake down and another stake down and another statement what are you telling you're telling that devil this is as far as you can come i'm not backing up i'm not gonna bid i'm not gonna break i'm driving my state down tonight i'm a son of god i'm driving that state tonight that's who i am and i'm willing to defend it with everything within me let me tell you when all hell turns loose on you all heavens turn loose also oh you had a prophet of god tell you that he caught the inspiration he says when all hell turns loose and it looks like you're going to die all heavens turn loose also drive your steak down tonight oh think about this if we as the bride will put as much attention on the promises of god as we do on the doubts and lives of the enemy where would we be where would we be if we would put as much focus on the word of god on the promises of god where would we be it's time to drive a stake see this is not a time to quit this is not a time to give up this is time for god's people to make a stand i'm going to serve god i don't care what it costs me you know that word is a military term at all costs at all costs that means you're willing to die in world war ii some of them generals they got them they got a message you defend this bridge and all costs they knew that it meant they were willing to give their life to make sure and it was better to go down and defeat than it was to be held captive by the enemy i'm telling you church it's better to go down and defeat trusting god than it is to be a captain and a slave to the enemy this saint whatever will be will be this is the time that we drive our stakes in the ground and occupy until jesus comes oh my keep keep taking ground team keep making advancements don't back up don't back off god is faithful to his word god is faithful to his people god's not seen the righteous forsaken god has not seen his seed begging for bread but no you keep confessing that you're here you keep confessing at your bride you keep confessing that you've got the holy ghost you keep confessing these things that you have need of in your life you keep confessing and keep taking ground occupy occupy tie yourself to the state by your faith and re refused to give up god i'm time tying myself to this word tonight by my faith faith that you've gifted to me as a son of god and i'm going to occupy till you come you know many times i'm going to tell you he would tell us you know a lot of times we go based on feelings don't we because we're human i got a couple real christians in here tonight they're bowing their heads they're agreeing some of you just like no no no please don't don't go there don't go there but a lot of times you know we face things a lot of times it's always with this this is your worst enemy now look at your neighbor there's some says maureen look look at your husband now he's not sure oh my she's still attractive after all these years got a brother mark you the man but there's times the devil would try to put put you at odds with each other but that's not your worst enemy your parents who look at your kids that's not your worst enemy you are your own worst enemy this flesh is your worst enemy this flesh and i know some of you you love your flesh look at you you've had a nice six seven hundred dollar suit on your flesh okay maybe not okay we went to ross and got our suits i got ross's here y'all probably got something crazy it's canada right some kind of supermarket store but what you know brother bam talked about we got this 500 mink coat on 84 cents because we think so much about this flesh but brother baby says now satan can whip me around the stump anywhere he can and you too own your feelings but this flesh i don't feel like they said something it hurt my feelings i mean come on really well you big child you big baby how many have ever had your feeling don't put your hand up [Music] you just throw it in your mind we don't want brother gerald to get offended like because y'all got hurt because he said something you like i didn't agree with that because that's what happens when you come to church there's something's going to be said not intentionally but there's times we get hurt because satan is going to use that as an avenue to beat you around the stump on your feelings and the best thing or is one of his greatest weapons is to take a brother take a sister take some church member because you expect it from somebody in the world they come up you get to try to order a cup of coffee and the lady almost throws it at you and they're like well she's having a bad day but you let a brother do that to your sister dude i tell you i ain't talking to him no more you'd be like sliding the door walking out but we find satan will use different people different aspects of a service and it begins to work on your flesh it begins to work on your feelings and the prophet of god will say he will beat you around the stump on your feelings that's right he goes but when i walk back and say thus saith the lord my faith is built on the word of god he can't whip that see that's why we tie on ourselves to the word you don't tie your faith to a man as much as i'm loved by my wife and by my children if i make a mistake and i fall away i don't want them to to to keep propping me up i want them to go on with the word of god i don't believe that'll happen but what i'm saying i'm trying to draw the parallel we don't elevate to man man i fail you man i hurt you not intentionally some may be but others don't but satan to use these moments and use these things to come against you and defeat you and to use it against you and we find the prophet of god will say theories don't change god's word no sir god's word is eternally true it's right our faith is based on there i'm saved because the word of god tells me i'm saved satan can whip me around anywhere on how you feel but i believe it because god says so when i accept him upon the basis of his word that's how i'm saved i believed it i confessed it and then it works the results but the first thing i'm saved because god's word teaches i'm saved that's how you're saved if you're saved he says satan can whip you on your ideas and things but he can't go around the word of god jesus said it is written and that settled it with all it's written in the scriptures that's why you got to point the devil back to the word it is written satan amen he says i'm not saved tonight because i shout and some of you probably said hey man praise god i don't shout i'm not saved tonight because because i felt a chill yeah i praise god we ain't feeling no chill no i met god's conditions in the bible that's why we're safe that's how we're saying he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me he has everlasting life and he shall not come into condemnation but he's passed from death unto life i believe that that's right and on them conditions i am saved because god said so amen so the same faith listen now the same faith that saves you is the same faith that heals you it's the same faith that delivers you it's the same faith that keeps you it's the same faith that's going to change your bodies see there's not one faith for salvation there's not another for healing there's not another for deliverance it's all one faith one faith one god one baptism one faith all you need is one faith and i love how the prophet of god and i'm gonna start bringing this down is this okay i don't know how long who i've been going a minute in 38 wow i didn't set that time real so we get to start all over again he says now they asked brother bannon what about miracles is it some different type of faith he said no it's the same faith there's only one faith in all good things and all things that are are original so there's only even for miracles see there's only one faith it's just how much do you believe see is is your faith increased because he's given everybody faith it's just how muscular if you want to call it that is your faith tonight now some of us we have we have smaller muscles i'm trying to make sure i say this correctly some of us like brother john back there he's got these big massive arms with a big bang running through the middle of it i'm working out with them damn like oh my goodness boy got some big arms please you know it's exercising you don't understand how much time he's put in how much effort has gone into it and a lot of times you see ministers and everybody this is oh my look at that man if i could just preach like that if i could just be like that but you don't understand all that they've gone through to get to that point think about my pastor he's maybe five foot five crippled in his feet different things and yet when he was a kid he missed out on being a kid he didn't go play sports he didn't play games he didn't have a social life with other kids because he was crippled he had a defect but what he did do he poured himself into the word of god and now you see all the pain that went through all these years being poured out into the ministry and ministers around the world and believers around the world can hear somebody preach the gospel with so much clarity but we don't elevate them up but what i'm saying is satan satan will try to use different aspects but it's one faith one lord one baptism church we have one god and we're going to point that enemy back to this word he says now see faith is common it's like they had in the old testament when they were preparing for an exodus he said it's like hyssop history was always used to sprinkle the blood because in the days of the passover moses commanded to take to his and dip it in blood and splash upon my doorpost on the lentils and applying of the blood see his it was a common weed and it represents common faith the believer coming must not be some supernatural praise god tonight he doesn't have to be some supernatural i don't know some kind of fellow that's got highly educated to he knows more than webster does okay he doesn't have to be any great theologian he just has to use common faith the hyssop and he says pick it up anywhere so young sister all you need is that kind of faith you don't have to have the faith of brother tim brother gerald brother john brother joe or whoever your favorite preacher is you just got to have your own common faith your own common faith will do as much for you is the super faith of some of these other men because when you realize the super faith there's greater battles the common faith will get you through that battle that you're in he goes listen now he says now he goes you think you have to have some supernatural faith to get something from god you do not just common faith like you got he said just apply the blood that's it you don't have to have some supernatural faith you don't have to have some super-duper faith you just got to use common faith he said the night of the passover they took the hyssops sprinkled the door in the little post and in the blood and sprinkle with the blood by the his sprinkle child like faith he goes you don't have to have any super faith how'd you come here tonight that's a question to y'all how'd y'all get here car side-by-side suv truck a horse i want y'all drive up here in canada i don't know but he goes how'd you get here tonight he goes how can you drive your car let me tell you how you drove your car you got out you got dressed you went out to your car you put the key in the ignition if you got that kind of car or you pushed a little button if you got that kind of car and what you do you wasn't sweating it out thinking oh praise god i hope this car starts hope this car said no you got it you didn't think anything about it it was just subconscious to you when you got in the car you put the key in or push the button it started up first thing it is put it in reverse if you're going backwards put it in drive if you're going forwards and what you started driving down the road and you arrived right here what not supernatural about that at all he says that's the same way faith works it's just common not some super-duper faith he goes that's the way you believe for your healing it's settled right there the same faith that got you in your car and brought you to church tonight it's the same faith that brings your healing it's the same faith that brings your deliverance it's the same faith that fills you with the holy ghost it's the very same faith tonight see it's just settled that's all it doesn't take some high education thank god because i'm not that smart you don't have to amend that that was just for me my wife us i heard some of y'all hey man you don't know me he goes just he says you don't have to have some high education and the house of god says hey man some super duper something thank god y'all thank god because you know what we're all on different degrees of our intellect anyway some of you are great some of you are great iq's high iqs great thinkers i'm not that guy i'm just simple enough to believe god at his word amen but it just takes common faith in god just believe it like you would if your mother would say she was going to get something for you man when your mama how many you you kids over here cause there's most of the kids mama says they're gonna pick you up some from the store something you've been wanting you've nagged her to death did you get it did you get it did you get it come on selena you smiling you know what i'm talking about did you get it did you get it did you get an hot chat did you get it did you get like man good luck i heard him get this she can wear me out because mama said i'm going to give you something he said it's the same kind of faith when you ask something from god you just keep asking god did you get it did you get it did you get it did you get it did you get it god's like would you i got to hurt him get this but it's common faith he don't have to go sit under a school of prophets and understand the great mysteries of god and understand all the ins and outs of this message he's not depending on that some of us will never understand the great mysteries you're not called to understand the great mysteries you're called to believe the word of god amen god has called some men to open the great mysteries to us and he sent one man to do that and that was a prophet and he's opened the entire world all the mysteries have now been revealed right all he's asking for you may not understand one of them you may not be able to remember one scripture but he's asking you to believe he's asking you to believe brother baby says now may every sick person in the divine presence this morning may they reach over now and just jerk a handful of hyssop out of their own life what little faith that they have and then apply the blood of jesus christ to that sick place and just watch it welt away i say won't you just grab a handful of it tonight grab your handful of that faith tonight him apply it to your need it may not be sickness it may be a troubled spirit it may be something tormenting you it may be something you need deliverance from it may be a question about uh you know just whatever it may be a job opportunity or whatever just grab hold check you some some faith outs and i grab hold of the word and just pull on one thing lord i'm gonna believe what brother joe said tonight because i'm not taking it from a man but i'm taking it from you god i believe you come and you discern the very thoughts the very intents of my heart you knew what i had need of and you sent a little man from louisiana all the way up here and he's preached what exactly i have needed i'm going to grab some faith tonight lord and i'm going to begin to apply the blood apply the word to my life pride to my whole apply to my family applied to my america applied to my church pride to my job apply to my school god i'm going to keep on applying because your word declares it oh just apply he says coming up here he's talking to the people coming up here doesn't he say doesn't mean that you're going to get healed you can be healed out there as much as you can be healed up here see god will heal you on the merits of your faith and that alone just as you believe now we're preaching on nothing will stand before your prayer see your prayers so i'm trying to i'm trying to get your faith on the foundation you as a son of god nothing will stand before your prayer because god will honor your faith see now because faith is designed to see what god's will and wants there is no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed and give to the human race to find out what the will of god is faith alone but when you've got god-given faith he's just focused he goes focused with the word of god you're directly in line and z wrote oh my he said god help us this hour great hour that we live in faith designed to see what god wants how do you see it through the camera of his word his promise this is the full revelation of jesus christ but he said many had failed to get their healing or they failed to get what they ask for because they take it as a myth or take it as an imagination he says faith is not an imagination it's just as real as any sense in your body now poke your neighbor real quick did you feel that did you feel that can i get a head nod at least yes okay so you felt that see that's not an imagination they touched you they hit you or poked you and it's just as real but the man said it's just as real as this is a piece of paper it's just as real as you see the lights on it's just as real as i feel my coat is just as real as you hear the baby talking about making this noise or the music playing it's just as real as i take something in my mouth it's that real only you can't show it to anybody he goes you have it alone see it's yours faith is a substance not just a myth i don't want faith to be some mythical thing that you got to work up to where you got to do hail mary's and you got to do this and do that and you got to work yourself work yourself because we'll never measure up because satan you do something wrong and he would take that and begin to beat you around the stump on it and then you got to now we feel like oh i gotta start all over again on my degrees of faith so i can reach up to believe no it doesn't operate that way he says now see it's something that you possess it's not an imagination it's a substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of god and that only faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god that puts it back where your faith in is not in the individual it's not in a man it's not an organization it's not in a group of people it's in god and god is his word your faith is in god not by what somebody else did or somebody else said but what god's word said let every man's word be a lie and mine be truth now as we bring this down to a close robin talks about jesus here he said he was walking through the world with perfect faith because he was the word now if he was the groom and we are the bride how are we to walk through this world we walk through this world with perfect faith not perfect faith in your failed humanity but for perfect faith in the word of god who's declared you what you are he sent a prophet and that prophet said you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ you can have perfect faith in knowing who you are see he was walking walking in the world with perfect faith because he was the word he says now if you abide in me and through him he brought the word to you and my words abide in you then walk in the same kind of way virtues flowing from you the rivers of god's fountains the blessings that are just flowing out to the people see what i mean you're not bluffing it you're not imagining it actually taking place you see it if you're not just imagining it don't do any good but if it's really there then he said it really happened so we are to walk through this world with perfect faith and the prophet of god will tell us perfect faith in a perfect word masters all circumstances there's not one thing that you'll face as a believer if your faith is anchored in the word of god that will ever defeat you so faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of god and without faith it is impossible without faith it is impossible to please him he that cometh the god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him he must believe that he's infinite that he's eternal that he's self-existent that he's the cause of all other beings and everything depends on him the energy depends on him bounty providence everything exists because of him and the bible will tell us in james 5 and verse 15 as we bring this to a close the prayer of faith shall save the sick the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up if he committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much the effectual that word there means it means active it means mighty this is not some dead prayer this is not some prayer offered in hope but this is a prayer offered in faith believing that god is going to do the mighty works and the bible said that the factual fervent prayer of the active prayer of a righteous man availeth much it means it endures much it does extraordinary deeds so otherwise the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails accomplishes much now notice if one can chase a thousand and two ten thousand what about a church this size tonight what about a church this size tonight what about a church that let go of their problems they'll let go of the issues they'll let go the circumstances they'll let go what they see taste smell fill here and all these other things and they'll have faith in a perfect god in a perfect word and it's telling us tonight church that the prevailing power there's a prevailing power in this body in this church in this bride to do extraordinary deeds to do miracles to see the supernatural to believe for lost loved ones to come back power to overcome and not be overcome amen there's a power to overcome and not be overcome and i will end with this last scripture and we'll pick this back up tomorrow night daniel 11 32 and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that know their god shall be strong and do exploits the people that know their god that word know there not only means to be known of god or to know god but it also means to be known of god amen so it's one thing to know god is another thing for god to know you so he's saying the people that know god and the people that god knows those people are going to do the great exploits because they have faith in my word so whatever you have need of tonight believe nothing will stand before your prayer and we'll pick up tomorrow night not even cancer not even cancer nothing will stand before your prayer tonight brother mark brother john sister priscilla nothing will stand before your prayer mr maureen not even cancer but it all hinges on faith do we believe that he will do what he said he would do if your faith is anchored in that and not moved from that then there's not a devil in hell can hinder the work of god there's not heart trouble there's not a diabetes there's not cancer there's not failed relationship disappointments depression fear complex whatever it is hell doesn't have enough to keep you from the blessings of god amen you believe that this evening ephesians three and verse twenty i said i was gonna that was gonna be my last christian but i got one more for you y'all told me i could go as long as i wanted i think i've gone pretty long he said now him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worker within us so he is able tonight to do exceeding abundantly amen above more above measure superseded more than you can even fathom in your mind god can do it let me just tell you i've seen god do it in my own life i walked away from a great job but god has has not let us fall yet god has continued to provide over and over and over and over and over because god can do exceeding abundantly because as a man i thought man how am i going to make this money up but god's like don't worry about that i'll be your financial

a very living way god as we have seen the evidence of the lamb god we have witnessed a supernatural we believe there's a living god in the land today and lord it's not just a god of 50 years ago or 60 years ago or 2 000 years ago but that same god is still here he's still present he's still moving he's still coming to church he's still speaking through the oracles he's still ministering to the needs and the hearts and the lives of the people and we're believing right now father nothing will stand before the believer's prayer not even cancer not even heart trouble no matter what it is not anything can stand before that prayer and we're asking god tonight that you move in such a special way may this just be the start lord have a wonderful weekend father may you just continue to anoint the lips of the speaker and the ears of the here god that we can get ourselves out of the way and hear and deliver what the spirit wants to be said and what the spirit would like to be heard may there be any misconstruction or misinterpretation of the word but god may it be expressly may it hit the mark father we love you tonight lord we bless your name father we just commit this service now to
