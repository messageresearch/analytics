[23:24] amen Heavenly Father we bow again Lord
[23:27] and ask Lord Your Grace is upon us as we
[23:30] come Lord to worship you in spirit and
[23:33] in truth Lord and Lord we just had
[23:35] desire to be Overcomers in this age Lord
[23:38] we strive Lord to surrender all to you
[23:41] Lord and Lord that you would just take
[23:43] everything in control Lord and bring it
[23:46] subject Lord to the word for this day
[23:48] and the our Lord and the spirit Lord
[23:51] diligently walks upon the Earth in each
[23:54] believer Lord getting us into the right
[23:56] place Lord in this final hour to be
[23:59] ready for that Rapture and the change of
[24:01] the body so we pray Lord that you would
[24:04] just remember each one Lord remember
[24:06] those that aren't with us Lord we just
[24:07] pray your grace and we just pray be with
[24:10] them and before them those that are
[24:12] traveling give them Lord just a blessing
[24:15] Lord and Lord that they would Lord just
[24:18] not fall into our delays Lord that they
[24:21] would be able to Lord just
[24:24] arrive their Journey safely and on time
[24:28] so we asked Lord that you would be with
[24:30] each one those who are sick member
[24:31] brother Kingsley if he goes to his
[24:33] baptism Lord we just thank you Lord for
[24:35] grace in his life and just be with him

[24:59] out of the way let the Holy Spirit speak
[25:01] through him and Lord that we could also
[25:03] move ourselves out of the way and Lord
[25:06] that we could receive Lord your word and
[25:08] your will today bless us all we pray in
[25:10] Jesus name amen you may be seated at
[25:13] this time
[25:14] so I'm just going to give a little tiny
[25:16] short update just we haven't done much
[25:19] there lately on the update
[25:22] so just it's only a couple of minutes
[25:24] there we said before that uh you know
[25:26] that all the things that had to be done
[25:28] need to get into the lawyers so we're
[25:30] selling this billing to 571 and we're
[25:33] buying 50 Longshore road trying to close
[25:36] all that at the one time so everything
[25:38] for this building is done it's all in
[25:40] the lawyer's hands there's nothing else
[25:41] to be done
[25:43] so there's more the issues with the
[25:45] other church and the other church is not
[25:47] as simple because there's a lot of
[25:50] structure on that side that's managing
[25:51] the sale of all of these churches that
[25:53] they're trying to sell so in this case
[25:55] here the church is all on the same
[25:59] property as the as the school and the
[26:03] residents so it's all what it was all
[26:05] one just one owner the RC church for
[26:09] that
[26:10] so they didn't put in a request into the
[26:13] town of CBS in order to get that land
[26:17] all divided up into three so they could
[26:20] get a proper survey so they didn't do
[26:22] that so that's a delay so there's going
[26:24] to be no January 4th that's not going to
[26:27] happen
[26:28] surprise surprise
[26:30] so uh is is now is gone out to January
[26:33] 11th
[26:35] so the lawyers kind of think that
[26:36] they're they're going to have that all
[26:40] done we hope by January 11th so the
[26:44] lawyer on the on the
[26:47] on the RC Church side
[26:49] they uh she she didn't work this week so
[26:52] so there was nothing done basically we
[26:55] just got into the Trap of this this uh
[26:58] time of the year unfortunate
[27:01] so
[27:03] if if something doesn't get done on the
[27:05] 11th the backup plan is that we're
[27:07] trying to get a rental agreement
[27:09] to get into the church so the lawyers
[27:11] are going to work on that the two
[27:13] lawyers are going to work to get an
[27:14] agreement so we would see us go in
[27:16] probably just pay the utilities for
[27:18] whatever at least we can get if we don't
[27:21] get that at least we're gonna
[27:23] work we get our stuff moved over in
[27:25] there anyway so but it shouldn't be any
[27:27] problem because
[27:28] in the other agreements the churches are
[27:30] having the same delays so they're doing
[27:33] rental agreements for those people too
[27:34] so should be a template there we'll sign
[27:37] it and get in so so that's the plan
[27:40] the backup plan is you know we'd have to
[27:44] get Andrew Fleming to find us a place or
[27:47] whatever so
[27:50] so it's a few things we can do but uh
[27:53] hopefully if the agreement doesn't go
[27:54] through we just get a rental agreement
[27:56] we go in we just it'll be normal except
[27:59] you won't be able to do many things and
[28:01] then you can uh you know when they do
[28:03] sign it off we can just take full
[28:05] control
[28:07] here I know that's not what that's going
[28:10] to be pushed out
[28:11] all done together he has all tied
[28:13] together it's still time together but
[28:15] but the the buyer of this place is
[28:17] really anxious to get in here and you
[28:20] can't blame him you know he wants to get
[28:21] started he's got all his permits in to
[28:24] get to get all the changes he wants in
[28:26] this building and stuff like that
[28:28] so it's unfortunate uh so everything is
[28:30] ready on our side the mortgage is ready
[28:32] all ready to go and when the lawyers
[28:35] wanted the money will go right too
[28:37] the city permit is done so for us to be
[28:40] uh
[28:41] you know uh and we don't know we're not
[28:44] subject to city taxes so uh because
[28:48] we're a charitable group so they we
[28:50] won't have to pay that insurance is all
[28:52] done
[28:53] and um
[28:56] it's just a matter of switching over
[28:57] some of the things like the utilities
[28:59] and the mailbox and all that kind of
[29:01] stuff so
[29:03] so uh
[29:06] so that's that's really it that's where
[29:07] we are it's uh really in the lawyer's
[29:09] hands there's nothing for us really to
[29:11] do only just uh
[29:13] if just you know just keep after him and
[29:17] get it done it's very busy on that side
[29:19] on the Ashley side with what you're
[29:21] doing because they started now with the
[29:23] schools as well so once that
[29:26] gets split up get a survey it should be
[29:29] all ready to go for us right and and
[29:32] hopefully we'll be in there even before
[29:34] you know we won't be much delay
[29:36] amen so that's where we are
[29:39] just a quick update defending changes
[29:41] we'll we'll be giving further updates
[29:44] amen
[29:47] so let's uh sing

[48:28] Amen I bring greetings this evening from
[48:30] Brother Jim Dooley from Brother Ed
[48:32] hammermeister from Brother Tony adma who
[48:34] said to mention specifically the coffees
[48:36] and brother Gerald and sister Betty
[48:38] since those are the ones that he knows
[48:40] and has traveled with are seen and
[48:41] whatnot but each of them I was talking
[48:42] to Brother John Andy's in the office as
[48:44] well so I'll pass on greetings from him
[48:46] but each of them wanted me to to
[48:48] remember them to the to the congregation
[48:50] and say that you have a special place in
[48:52] their heart and they're thinking of you
[48:53] brother Jim Dooley will be here in the
[48:54] spring Lord willing so I was telling
[48:56] them about the new church so he was very
[48:58] excited about that but each one of them
[49:00] wanted to be remembered so God bless you
[49:01] from each of those different men amen
[49:04] Luke chapter two I know we're past
[49:05] Christmas but this is kind of the
[49:07] Christmas message that the lord has laid
[49:09] on my heart
[49:10] so Luke 2 and verse 4 says and Joseph
[49:12] also went up From Galilee out of the
[49:15] city of Nazareth under Judea under the
[49:17] city of David which is called Bethlehem
[49:19] because he was of the house and lineage
[49:21] of David to be taxed with Mary his
[49:23] espoused wife being great with child and
[49:25] so it was that while they were there the
[49:27] days were accomplished that she should
[49:29] be delivered and she brought forth her
[49:31] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[49:33] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[49:35] Manger because there was no room for
[49:37] them in the Inn amen God bless you you
[49:40] can have your seats and I know we're
[49:42] past Christmas time but certainly I
[49:45] wasn't sure if we were going to have
[49:46] have a service on on Christmas day so
[49:48] but I was just praying Lord what would
[49:50] you have me to minister and we don't
[49:52] want to preach a Christmas message by
[49:53] tradition that's for sure amen we want
[49:55] to go by leadership and so I just said
[49:57] Lord if you want me to break into to my
[49:59] Redemption series and whatnot then give
[50:01] me a thought and and so I was just
[50:04] dwelling on different things and this
[50:06] thought dropped into my heart of a title
[50:08] and it was the condescending God Amen
[50:10] condescending God and just stuck there
[50:13] and the Lord started to bring some
[50:14] scriptures to my mind and then I started
[50:16] to have conversations with different
[50:17] people about this very thing and whatnot
[50:19] so I said Lord I'm just going to trust
[50:21] you and and allow you to kind of lead me
[50:23] through it so I I want to speak on the
[50:25] condescending God Amen and we just read
[50:27] in Luke Chapter 2 of how God
[50:29] condescended how he came down and the
[50:31] Simplicity and the humility that was
[50:33] behind it but I want to start with this
[50:35] word condescend or condescending because
[50:37] today if somebody's condescending it's
[50:40] not a compliment it's not a good thing
[50:42] we say if somebody's condescending it
[50:43] means they're snooty they're they're
[50:45] haughty they think they're better than
[50:46] you they they think they're at a higher
[50:48] level of life than you they have more
[50:50] money than you they're better looking
[50:51] they're Better Built you know whatever
[50:53] they have a better career they have
[50:55] better family whatever it is and they'll
[50:56] be condescending if they're around you
[50:58] and they they talk down to you so often
[51:00] and you can tell that they're just not
[51:02] comfortable being around you that they
[51:04] they think they're out of their element
[51:05] and they're supposed to be above maybe
[51:07] the people that they're with but the the
[51:10] word condo sand in its original use and
[51:12] certainly in its biblical use means
[51:14] something different or it means what
[51:16] it's ought to mean before we we added
[51:18] the slight to it that we do today and it
[51:20] it means to willingly lower oneself to
[51:23] another's level to willingly do it
[51:25] because today people condescend
[51:27] unwillingly they come down and they'll
[51:29] spend time with you because they have to
[51:31] because they work with you because they
[51:33] have to deal with you in their job or or
[51:34] even at church or whatever it might be
[51:36] and they they they're condescending but
[51:39] they don't want to be in that position
[51:41] they don't want to be around the people
[51:42] they're with but yet when God
[51:44] condescended he willingly did it he did
[51:46] this of his own free will he desired to
[51:49] do it amen and he had to step into
[51:51] something other than a Godly form to
[51:53] come down and redeem this Earth so we're
[51:55] not I haven't titled this as part of the
[51:57] Redemption series but this is the start
[51:58] of redemption in terms of the physical
[52:00] portion of redemption it was the start
[52:03] of the the real plan of God of
[52:05] redemption when going into into in the
[52:07] manifestation but when God came down and
[52:10] dwelt in a body called Jesus Christ it
[52:12] wasn't a super body with superpowers
[52:14] with with super capabilities to do
[52:17] things that we couldn't necessarily do
[52:19] what he did was he came down in a body
[52:21] like Adam had
[52:22] if you because it was a body that was
[52:24] made without sin but yet it was still
[52:26] subject to the things that Adam was
[52:28] subject to it still had a brain it still
[52:30] had emotions it still had hormones it
[52:32] still had thoughts that could run
[52:34] through it it could still receive
[52:35] Temptation it could still receive
[52:38] influence from other people and and by
[52:40] the spirit world and all these different
[52:42] things amen so when he came down he
[52:44] didn't build himself a body that would
[52:46] be immune to humanity
[52:48] he stepped into the very thing that
[52:50] humanity is that Humanity was at that
[52:52] time and he didn't come down with a big
[52:54] name or a big Heritage or big wealth or
[52:57] Fanfare he wasn't warning born into a
[53:00] Grand Mansion or or the best hospital
[53:02] with the best doctors but he came down
[53:04] in a very quiet way and the only ones
[53:06] that knew where he was in a dirty filthy
[53:09] stable surrounded by livestock were
[53:11] shepherds and his parents
[53:13] that's how he came down in it amen and
[53:15] he came down in a humble way
[53:17] and we're talking about the great God
[53:19] the the self-existing one the one that
[53:21] is worthy of our praise and our honor
[53:23] and he came down in a way that required
[53:25] no worship and no praise
[53:28] he came down in a way that wouldn't draw
[53:30] people to him and the prophet of God
[53:32] said this he says that's what makes him
[53:34] God to me because he humbled himself
[53:37] when we talk about condescending God it
[53:40] means he's humbling himself willingly
[53:42] for purpose
[53:44] and he's coming to somebody that is
[53:45] beneath him naturally speaking with a
[53:48] purpose and the prophet says God is
[53:50] humility don't never forget that
[53:53] humility is God never boastful it's
[53:58] always humility amen I believe the
[54:00] prophet of God said an arrogant spirit
[54:02] is never of God and you know that
[54:05] somebody is not having the Holy Spirit
[54:06] influencing them if they have an
[54:08] arrogant spirit because we never saw
[54:10] that in Christ you can be hard and not
[54:13] be arrogant you can be right to not be
[54:15] arrogant you can be correct you can be
[54:17] corrective and not be arrogant amen but
[54:20] he came in humility brother Brown would
[54:22] say when he came he was in a barn born
[54:25] by a mother and a father that had an
[54:26] illegitimate background to it seemed to
[54:29] be as they thought wrapped in his
[54:31] swaddling clothes they tell me was off
[54:32] the Yoke of an ox they were that poor
[54:34] and God the god that created heavens and
[54:37] earth and made everything by Christ
[54:39] Jesus and here was the very Creator God
[54:42] who made the very heavens and earth
[54:44] laying in a stable in a bunch of straw
[54:47] that he had created himself
[54:49] the creator of heavens and earth humbled
[54:52] himself to become the lowest
[54:56] the highest becoming the lowest that's
[54:58] what made him God that's what made him
[55:01] what he was see he humbled himself man
[55:03] couldn't do that and let me say today
[55:06] man can't do that and you can't humble
[55:09] yourself in the way that he did unless
[55:11] you have the very nature of Christ
[55:12] inside of you unless you get the Holy
[55:14] Spirit you say I know lots of humble
[55:15] people in the world push him
[55:17] push him everybody's humble to a point
[55:20] sometimes but you push them beyond the
[55:22] point and then you see what happens
[55:23] guess what Pride will flare up
[55:25] self-preservation will flap something
[55:27] will come up but in if you have the
[55:29] spirit of Christ you have the nature of
[55:30] Christ you'll Humber yourself all the
[55:31] way to death because in death you'll
[55:34] find life as well when we come out of it
[55:35] amen but God came down with a purpose
[55:37] and a part of that purpose was so that
[55:40] he could experience what it meant to be
[55:42] like you and I
[55:44] because you've got to realize that God
[55:45] is a spirit the scripture says God is a
[55:47] spirit he doesn't have a natural body
[55:49] the way we have he doesn't understand he
[55:52] could not he does now but he could not
[55:54] understand what it meant to be human he
[55:57] could understand it in the way that we
[55:58] understand pain
[56:00] so let me put it this way if I say it
[56:02] what does a punch feel like if somebody
[56:04] punches you what does it feel like you
[56:06] say it hurts
[56:07] and you know intellectually that the
[56:10] definition of what you feel when you get
[56:11] punched is hurt pain but you don't know
[56:15] what it means to be punched until what
[56:17] you get punched and so God could say I
[56:20] understand that that they have emotions
[56:23] and I understand that they have thoughts
[56:24] and I understand that they have
[56:26] temptations but you're in a you're
[56:27] looking at it through the lens of a God
[56:29] who is completely pure there's no
[56:31] there's no shadow of turning no
[56:33] variableness in them there's no sin
[56:34] there's no deceit there's no hypocrisy
[56:37] God in that form can't even be tempted
[56:39] amen so he could he could have a concept
[56:42] of what it meant to be human but he
[56:44] couldn't understand it by experience and
[56:46] so when he came down part of the reason
[56:48] he came into human flesh was so that he
[56:50] could understand what it was that we
[56:53] went through and why we do things the
[56:55] way we do why we are so foolish so often
[56:58] why we fail so easily where are the
[57:00] faults and cracks come into our life
[57:01] because he could only understand it
[57:03] because he all he knew everything but he
[57:05] couldn't have the understanding of the
[57:07] feeling of it of the way that we work in
[57:08] these things
[57:10] God wanted to see what we see and he
[57:12] wanted to experience what we experienced
[57:14] prophet of God said when God dropped he
[57:17] unfolded himself unfolded himself down
[57:19] until he come to this man now man sinned
[57:22] not in his Spirit but in his body lust
[57:25] passion then when he sinned he separated
[57:28] himself from his maker and then God the
[57:30] logos the very creator of him came down
[57:33] and was made in the image of man man was
[57:35] made in the image of God and then he was
[57:37] made in the image of the Beast and he
[57:39] fell and God came down in the image of
[57:41] man in the man Christ Jesus to suffer
[57:44] pain
[57:46] God could not suffer pain in the spirit
[57:48] how could he suffer physical pain in the
[57:50] spirit he couldn't do it so God unfolded
[57:53] himself and was made in the image of man
[57:55] to redeem the man that was lost see
[57:58] he said and then God suffered in flesh
[58:02] First Timothy 3 16 says without
[58:04] controversy that's argument without
[58:07] argument great is the mystery of
[58:09] godliness for God was manifested in the
[58:11] flesh scene of angels preached on and
[58:14] believed and received up to the right
[58:15] hand of the father is that right God
[58:18] himself came down and lived in a human
[58:20] body and suffered remember he said God
[58:23] suffered In the Flesh he says God
[58:25] suffered Temptation God was in Christ
[58:28] reconciling the world to himself he said
[58:30] see what love is the love of God that he
[58:34] would come down and he would suffer when
[58:36] he didn't have to suffer that he would
[58:38] go through the things that we go through
[58:39] not having to necessarily go through it
[58:42] amen it wasn't morbid curiosity that
[58:44] brought that brought God down from
[58:46] heaven amen because God doesn't do
[58:47] things for fun church God moves with
[58:50] purpose he has a plan he has a goal he
[58:53] knows where he's going and he knows what
[58:54] he has to do to get there so he doesn't
[58:56] play around
[58:57] if you see someone playing around with
[58:59] the gifts in their life and saying that
[59:01] it's God that's not God God comes down
[59:03] to edify the body with the gifts that we
[59:05] have he comes down to edify with the
[59:07] skills that we have with the things that
[59:08] we bring and it was no different here
[59:10] God didn't come down to have some fun in
[59:12] the human body just to see what it was
[59:14] like but he came down with purpose so
[59:16] that and that suffering in that
[59:18] Temptation in that new experience he
[59:21] would achieve something that he was
[59:22] supposed to achieve all along
[59:24] the prophet of God says love moved a
[59:26] mighty God God so loved the world the
[59:29] unlovable till he calmed down and made
[59:32] himself flash here on Earth and dwelt
[59:35] among men to what
[59:36] be spit upon mistreated laughed at made
[59:41] fun of and to redeem us back
[59:44] what are we to do tonight take our
[59:46] places by the side of the Cross and say
[59:48] here I stand Lord I come I come wash all
[59:52] my sins away take my malice take my
[59:55] difference away from me Let Me Love You
[59:57] Lord with a pure fervent love that all
[1:00:01] these little old things will pass away
[1:00:02] we preach a gospel a gospel of good news
[1:00:06] and so often what the world says is that
[1:00:09] good news is my sins are gone but the
[1:00:12] prophet rightly focuses here and he says
[1:00:14] it's not just that your sins are gone he
[1:00:16] says the gospel is my sinful nature is
[1:00:19] gone that is what he is he's allowed me
[1:00:22] to die and renew me in life by the holy
[1:00:25] spirit so that now I am like he is he
[1:00:28] says what take away my differences my
[1:00:30] malice and let me love you that takes
[1:00:33] the what the spirit of God inside of you
[1:00:35] to do that amen you've got to be able to
[1:00:37] die and come back again the good news is
[1:00:40] that you have died in somebody else's
[1:00:42] living inside of you it's not just that
[1:00:44] you're sinless that he took away your
[1:00:46] sin but that he now takes you someplace
[1:00:48] where you can do something with that
[1:00:49] sinlessness amen that you can be a
[1:00:51] purpose to God Amen we're born wrong and
[1:00:54] because we're born wrong we live wrong
[1:00:56] and so because we live wrong we have to
[1:00:58] die and be born Anew and you can only do
[1:01:01] that by the Holy Ghost amen we're
[1:01:03] speaking of a condescending God and I
[1:01:05] want to focus on that condescending
[1:01:07] because God didn't just condescend
[1:01:10] in a way that he could have because we
[1:01:13] looked through time and we saw what he
[1:01:15] came down in a pillar of fire and he
[1:01:17] condescended to talk to Moses but that
[1:01:19] that didn't require anything special of
[1:01:21] God God can slip into any form he wants
[1:01:24] God can slip into an Angelic form he can
[1:01:26] step into because he what he did it time
[1:01:29] and time again he can look like a man he
[1:01:31] did it as Melchizedek he did it as one
[1:01:33] of the Three Angels that walked up to
[1:01:35] Abraham on the plains of mamry before
[1:01:36] they went to to Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:01:39] right it can be a pillar of fire he can
[1:01:41] be all these things but that's not God
[1:01:42] condescending because he doesn't have to
[1:01:44] lower himself to do it
[1:01:46] he doesn't have to take himself out of
[1:01:48] that that that that perfect way that he
[1:01:50] is but when he came down this time he
[1:01:53] had to lower himself because he had to
[1:01:54] step into a body that could potentially
[1:01:57] taste sin that could feel the bad things
[1:02:00] because you can't hurt God in the sense
[1:02:03] that you can hurt a human you can't
[1:02:04] offend God in the way that you can
[1:02:06] offend offend us because God is
[1:02:07] righteous and so we even the scripture
[1:02:10] they it attributes characteristics to
[1:02:13] God of anger and love and these
[1:02:14] different things but he's Bound by the
[1:02:16] word and really what he is is he's he
[1:02:18] he's reacting by the word to situations
[1:02:21] so his his anger is not like our anger
[1:02:24] and neither is his love like our love
[1:02:26] because we'll see his love that'll
[1:02:28] that'll beat you just as hard as it'll
[1:02:29] hug you
[1:02:30] and these different things so God's
[1:02:32] attributes in in a non-condescending
[1:02:35] form are not like what he had when he
[1:02:36] came down in Christ amen
[1:02:38] amen he came completely differently
[1:02:40] because it was with a different purpose
[1:02:42] the prophet of God would say this and
[1:02:43] show us the father he says oh Christ the
[1:02:45] lovely one the darling of God's bosom
[1:02:48] coming down from the ivory palaces of
[1:02:50] Heaven clothed in the form of sinful
[1:02:53] flesh he humiliated himself born in a
[1:02:56] barn in a stable why Lord why because
[1:03:00] Lambs are not born in houses Lambs are
[1:03:03] born in Barns and they let him away to
[1:03:06] Calvary like a sheep to the slaughter
[1:03:07] they led him like Abel LED his lamb they
[1:03:10] led him away humiliated looking back
[1:03:13] seeing the people and them gambling
[1:03:14] spitting on him his face full of mockery
[1:03:17] spit but he was willing to Bear it all
[1:03:19] that we could be saved
[1:03:21] and then we pour alienated Gentiles
[1:03:24] carried away with dumb Idols in the
[1:03:26] lusts of the world living here in this
[1:03:28] day just before his coming and then he
[1:03:30] says we're ashamed to take our way with
[1:03:33] the Lord's despised
[1:03:34] God if there be a sinner man or woman
[1:03:37] here tonight who's never been born again
[1:03:39] may they be ashamed of the way they've
[1:03:41] treated you
[1:03:43] now you say brother John that's not me
[1:03:45] well here's what he says it is carry
[1:03:48] more for the things of this world than
[1:03:50] they do for you turning a cold shoulder
[1:03:53] to Christ
[1:03:55] anything you put before him
[1:03:57] is turning a cold shoulder to Christ
[1:03:59] whether it's money whether it's
[1:04:01] friendships whether it's your looks
[1:04:03] whether it's your career your education
[1:04:05] whatever it might be we can turn a cold
[1:04:07] shoulder to Christ amen
[1:04:10] we've been preaching on Redemption but I
[1:04:12] want you to catch what he did when he
[1:04:14] came down in this body of Flesh because
[1:04:16] he didn't make it easy on himself
[1:04:19] right when Christ came down he was not
[1:04:21] born knowing all things having all
[1:04:23] things Victorious over all things he had
[1:04:25] to grow and mature and God wanted an
[1:04:27] authentic experience amen he had to go
[1:04:30] through everything that you and I do
[1:04:32] amen it had to be authentic so he didn't
[1:04:35] give himself a superpower in and of
[1:04:37] itself
[1:04:38] he gave him a body that could make the
[1:04:40] same choice that Adam and Eve could have
[1:04:42] made
[1:04:43] that's how he came down and he came into
[1:04:45] a body that had no sin in it but that
[1:04:47] doesn't mean it could not sin
[1:04:49] he had to choose every day not to sin
[1:04:52] not to disbelieve not to step outside of
[1:04:55] the word of God every day of his life
[1:04:56] Christ had to make that decision amen
[1:04:59] but his very entrance into the world the
[1:05:02] very way he came in was humiliating it
[1:05:04] was unconventional it was poor it was
[1:05:07] dirty it was stinky it was cold
[1:05:10] his very entrance
[1:05:12] ought to give us a comfort to tell him
[1:05:15] about the things we're dealing with in
[1:05:16] life
[1:05:17] that we ought not to be ashamed of how
[1:05:19] we are
[1:05:20] because listen we come into this world
[1:05:22] and we didn't choose how we came into it
[1:05:23] we didn't choose our genetics we didn't
[1:05:25] choose our family traditions we didn't
[1:05:26] choose our church we didn't choose our
[1:05:28] ministry we didn't choose where we were
[1:05:30] born in terms of the geography
[1:05:32] and guess what that leads to things in
[1:05:34] our life doesn't it not all of us have a
[1:05:37] great name none of us all of us have a
[1:05:40] great family heritage
[1:05:41] not all of us are good looking not all
[1:05:44] of us are well built not all of us make
[1:05:45] a lot of money
[1:05:47] not all of us have big homes not all of
[1:05:49] us have homes to call our own
[1:05:52] but he came and he had nothing
[1:05:54] they didn't even have room for him in
[1:05:56] the hotel
[1:05:57] and he was born with the animals among
[1:05:59] the stink of the livestock why so that
[1:06:01] we would not be ashamed to come to him
[1:06:03] when we don't have anything either amen
[1:06:05] that he could under that we could go and
[1:06:07] say you know what it's like to be like I
[1:06:09] am today Lord and he'd say I've been
[1:06:11] there child I was born there and I
[1:06:13] stayed there my entire life he never
[1:06:15] Rose to Great Heights he never got a big
[1:06:18] all the Applause of people he had his
[1:06:21] moments
[1:06:22] usually around food
[1:06:25] when he did the mistake when he did he
[1:06:27] did the Miracles and he provided this
[1:06:29] and that and the other thing but as soon
[1:06:30] as it came down to the where the rubber
[1:06:32] meets the road where the word comes then
[1:06:34] they all turned their back so many times
[1:06:36] to the end where they killed him amen
[1:06:39] God came on a way that ought to let us
[1:06:41] know that we don't have to fear
[1:06:44] to tell him whatever it is we're dealing
[1:06:46] with in life to be honest with him it
[1:06:48] meant to say Lord I'm struggling Lord
[1:06:50] I'm feeling left out Lord I'm feeling
[1:06:52] isolated Lord I'm feeling rejected Lord
[1:06:55] I'm feeling poor
[1:06:57] because he can identify with that
[1:06:59] because he had an authentic Human
[1:07:01] Experience when he came down amen he
[1:07:03] knows what it is to be an outcast he
[1:07:05] spent most of his life as an outcast he
[1:07:07] was a bastard to most people they
[1:07:09] thought he was born illegitimately
[1:07:12] that's the way he spent his life and
[1:07:14] guess what in those days you couldn't
[1:07:15] come into the temple that way
[1:07:18] you are supposed to even be allowed to
[1:07:20] worship
[1:07:21] he was Outcast he was poor he was ragged
[1:07:25] he didn't have a good name he came from
[1:07:26] a bad town with a bad reputation
[1:07:29] he had a bad reputation in a town with a
[1:07:31] bad reputation that's how bad it was for
[1:07:33] Christ amen
[1:07:35] why did he have such a hard start to
[1:07:37] life
[1:07:37] and why was his life so difficult
[1:07:40] Paul talks about it in Hebrews he says
[1:07:42] in Hebrews 4 14. seeing then that we
[1:07:45] have a high priest that is passed into
[1:07:47] the heavens Jesus the son of God let us
[1:07:50] hold fast our profession for we have not
[1:07:53] a high priest which cannot be touched
[1:07:55] with the feelings of our infirmities
[1:07:57] but was in all points tested like as we
[1:08:01] are yet without sin let us therefore
[1:08:04] what come boldly to the throne of grace
[1:08:08] that we may obtain Mercy you don't need
[1:08:10] Mercy if you haven't done anything wrong
[1:08:12] Church you don't need Mercy if you're
[1:08:14] perfect
[1:08:15] so this scripture in verse 16 is for
[1:08:17] those that are imperfect for those that
[1:08:19] need Grace for those that need Mercy for
[1:08:21] those that need Deliverance for those
[1:08:23] that need healing and to come in and say
[1:08:25] that Lord I know that you know what I
[1:08:28] feel like Lord I know that you know what
[1:08:30] it's like to be in this condition to
[1:08:32] know at least the the struggle of the
[1:08:34] choice
[1:08:35] if not the condition
[1:08:38] amen
[1:08:39] he says that we may obtain obtain mercy
[1:08:42] and find Grace to help in time of need
[1:08:47] it gave him insight as he was going
[1:08:49] through life
[1:08:50] God can't have that Rush of adrenaline
[1:08:53] when some kid comes over and calls you a
[1:08:55] bastard and calls your mother a
[1:08:58] that's what they would have called his
[1:08:59] mother that's what they would have
[1:09:00] called him tried to pick fights and and
[1:09:03] to feel that that flush of shame but
[1:09:05] then the rage that while your body wants
[1:09:07] to reach out and strike that person for
[1:09:08] doing it he knew what that felt like to
[1:09:10] be angry he knew what it was to be
[1:09:13] unjustly accused amen he knew what
[1:09:16] rejection feels like
[1:09:19] and he knew what I felt to feel shame
[1:09:21] even when you weren't supposed to feel
[1:09:22] shame because they were wrong and you
[1:09:24] were right
[1:09:24] he felt all these things he because why
[1:09:27] he was in a body that can't control its
[1:09:29] emotions
[1:09:30] that can't control the hormones that
[1:09:32] surge through your body he know what it
[1:09:34] was like to be a young man that starts
[1:09:36] to notice what young women for the first
[1:09:37] time and all the Temptation that comes
[1:09:40] with that
[1:09:41] he knows what it's like to try and maybe
[1:09:43] joke or tease somebody that shouldn't be
[1:09:46] teased because the other boys or the
[1:09:48] other kids are doing it all of those
[1:09:49] Temptations were there for him amen
[1:09:53] but it wasn't just so he could
[1:09:54] understand us
[1:09:56] and I want you to catch this amen this
[1:09:59] is a key to this whole this whole
[1:10:00] service I believe it wasn't just so he
[1:10:02] could understand us but it's so that he
[1:10:04] could do something about it
[1:10:07] that he would know how to work with us
[1:10:09] that he would know how to deal with us
[1:10:11] that would give him maybe a greater
[1:10:13] grace and patience and mercy than he had
[1:10:15] before
[1:10:16] prophet of God says brother when I see
[1:10:18] God the god of Heaven forfeited his
[1:10:21] throne his Beauty all that he was to be
[1:10:23] born on top of him in your pile be
[1:10:26] wrapped in swaddling claws to be made
[1:10:28] fun of by his signs and his wonders be
[1:10:30] called the devil should I be ashamed of
[1:10:32] him no sir
[1:10:35] let the classic world do what they want
[1:10:37] to do to me he's a super sign the Holy
[1:10:41] Ghost In Me screams out it might make me
[1:10:43] act funny and be a crazy man by this
[1:10:45] world but I cannot deny him who has done
[1:10:48] so much for me he took my place in death
[1:10:51] he took my place at Calvary he done all
[1:10:54] these things but listen to this he said
[1:10:56] he condescended from heaven from the
[1:10:59] pearly white Thrones to become a man to
[1:11:03] taste my suffering to go through my
[1:11:06] Temptation why brother John to know how
[1:11:10] to be the right kind of mediator in me
[1:11:12] to lead me and to guide me to eternal
[1:11:15] life and through his poverty I am made
[1:11:18] Rich through his death I'm given life
[1:11:20] eternal life don't deny him don't be
[1:11:23] ashamed of him he says don't be ashamed
[1:11:25] of him again but Embrace him and say yes
[1:11:28] my dear Lord give to me like they did on
[1:11:30] the day of Pentecost Lord give to me the
[1:11:33] Holy Ghost pour it into my heart art I
[1:11:36] don't care what the teenagers say I
[1:11:38] don't care what the world says I'm not
[1:11:40] looking to them I'm looking to you what
[1:11:43] is it joining Church
[1:11:45] saying you believe the message no he
[1:11:48] says the super sign Emmanuel God With Us
[1:11:53] oh he says there to know how to be the
[1:11:55] right kind of mediator in me to lead me
[1:11:58] and guide me to her eternal life catch
[1:12:01] that church we know he's our mediator
[1:12:03] and we know that it's his blood that's
[1:12:05] on the mercy seat and when the judge
[1:12:07] looks down at us then he says what look
[1:12:11] at the blood look at the sacrifice and
[1:12:14] he's mediating for us and he's saying
[1:12:16] look at me don't look at them look at me
[1:12:18] look at me amen amen but the prophet you
[1:12:21] know the scripture says in first Timothy
[1:12:22] 2 for there is one God one mediator
[1:12:25] between man God and Men the man Jesus
[1:12:27] Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom
[1:12:30] for all to be testified in due time
[1:12:32] for the prophet of God he takes it a
[1:12:34] step deeper than this it's not just that
[1:12:36] he's mediating for you but he says no he
[1:12:39] says he has to know how to be the right
[1:12:41] of the kind of mediator mediator in me
[1:12:43] to lead and guide me to eternal life why
[1:12:46] a mediator in you
[1:12:48] because the mediator in you says I
[1:12:50] understand what you're feeling I
[1:12:52] understand what you're going through I
[1:12:55] understand what it feels like to be
[1:12:57] where you're at today
[1:12:58] he understands it amen can I speak
[1:13:01] personally this evening as a father as a
[1:13:04] husband as a minister so many times
[1:13:06] we're giving direction we're telling
[1:13:09] people what to do we're telling people
[1:13:10] how to do it and we're speaking
[1:13:12] hopefully out of the word of God when we
[1:13:14] do it and sometimes we declare what is
[1:13:16] right and wrong
[1:13:17] we ought to his husbands as fathers we
[1:13:19] ought to be leading our houses that way
[1:13:21] and as a minister I better be leading by
[1:13:23] the word of God
[1:13:24] but you know what makes it easy for
[1:13:27] people to hear it
[1:13:28] is when I can come in and I can say I've
[1:13:31] been where you are
[1:13:33] I've experienced that pain I've
[1:13:35] experienced that hurt I've experienced
[1:13:37] rejection I've experienced 10 cents in
[1:13:40] the bank account I've experienced people
[1:13:42] looking at me funny I've experienced the
[1:13:44] the the the chains of lust
[1:13:47] I've experienced what it feels like to
[1:13:49] have people turn their back on you I
[1:13:52] know what you're going through but then
[1:13:54] I can say what but I got out of it and
[1:13:58] you can too if you do the same thing I
[1:13:59] did I can mediate with them I can work
[1:14:02] with them and then they can see so
[1:14:04] brother John you know what I'm talking
[1:14:05] about yes I do brother yes I do sister
[1:14:08] I've been there
[1:14:09] I've been there I've done that I know
[1:14:12] how it hurts I know the shame you feel
[1:14:14] amen I know how difficult it is
[1:14:18] but then I say but you can get out
[1:14:20] because the mediator won't leave you
[1:14:22] where you're at
[1:14:24] he'll take you to where you can be to
[1:14:26] where you ought to be and that's why the
[1:14:27] mediator has to be in you is he
[1:14:29] understands and you can say Lord do you
[1:14:32] understand he says child I understand
[1:14:35] but don't stay there I'm here to take
[1:14:37] you past that and he's saying have mercy
[1:14:39] while I work with him have mercy while I
[1:14:42] work with her look at me until I get
[1:14:44] them to a place where they can look just
[1:14:45] like me
[1:14:46] hey man what he became me so that I
[1:14:49] could become him and the mediator is
[1:14:51] taking you to where he was to where he
[1:14:53] is amen he's bringing you to that place
[1:14:56] amen there's a provided way amen I'm not
[1:14:59] just identifying with you that's not
[1:15:00] what you want but you want somebody that
[1:15:02] can take you past it amen I believe
[1:15:04] that's why a pastor can't be a novice
[1:15:06] because they have to experience the
[1:15:09] faults and the failures of humanity in
[1:15:12] themselves
[1:15:13] they have to understand what it means to
[1:15:15] battle and to fight
[1:15:18] and to know the shame that comes when
[1:15:20] you don't quite make it
[1:15:22] but then what because otherwise all they
[1:15:24] do is they preach victories they've
[1:15:25] never had in their life and that's no
[1:15:27] good for the people but when they say
[1:15:29] Brothers I've dealt with that and God
[1:15:32] has delivered with me sisters I know
[1:15:34] what you're going through I've worked
[1:15:36] with my wife through it and maybe I've
[1:15:38] worked through it myself in some cases
[1:15:39] the things that our sisters go through
[1:15:41] what is it it allows them to say so
[1:15:44] you're not preaching at me Brother John
[1:15:46] you're working with me you know where
[1:15:48] I'm at
[1:15:49] brother Gerald you know where we're at
[1:15:51] amen yes I believe that's why we can't
[1:15:54] sit up here and try and pretend we're
[1:15:55] perfect it'll never work it never
[1:15:57] engages the people in the same way
[1:15:59] because they think that we're above it
[1:16:00] all and guess what we're not
[1:16:02] I put my pants on one leg at a time just
[1:16:04] like everybody else and I deal with the
[1:16:06] same things that every man in here does
[1:16:09] we have the same imperfect family and
[1:16:10] the same and perfect spouses and the
[1:16:12] same imperfect children and the same and
[1:16:14] perfect jobs and the ups and downs of
[1:16:15] life and all these things like everybody
[1:16:16] else does but we're here to show you
[1:16:19] that God can deliver that God can lead
[1:16:21] that God can provide that God can do
[1:16:23] whatever it is that his word says he's
[1:16:25] supposed to be doing in your life amen
[1:16:28] amen what is it God didn't just
[1:16:31] condescend to feel your pain and your
[1:16:34] hurt and your rejection but he came down
[1:16:36] and he lived what you're living and he
[1:16:38] rose above it to show you that you can
[1:16:41] do the very same thing if if you get the
[1:16:44] same life in you that he had amen
[1:16:46] what it is the scripture says that what
[1:16:49] he was tempted without like as we were
[1:16:51] it's right here he says we have not a
[1:16:53] high priest which cannot be touched with
[1:16:55] the feeling of our infirmities in other
[1:16:56] words it's not wrong to go to God and
[1:16:58] say God this is how I feel
[1:17:01] it's not wrong to go and say God I feel
[1:17:04] angry at that brother I feel angry at
[1:17:07] that sister Lord I feel hate
[1:17:10] Lord I'm just plain annoyed and I don't
[1:17:13] want to be around them
[1:17:14] guess what Jesus was around a lot of
[1:17:16] people he didn't want to be around with
[1:17:18] if he had to make the choice
[1:17:21] but what he willingly put himself there
[1:17:23] anyways because their need was was
[1:17:25] something that he could meet if they'd
[1:17:27] only let him amen but what he got the
[1:17:29] victory he says but was in all points
[1:17:32] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[1:17:34] you say brother he didn't do it the
[1:17:36] scripture says everything you've gone
[1:17:38] through he went through it and he felt
[1:17:40] it and he knew what it was like and yet
[1:17:42] in all those things he got the victory
[1:17:45] that's what it means without sin was
[1:17:47] mean he got the victory didn't mean he
[1:17:49] didn't have a fight it means he got the
[1:17:51] victory amen and you say well of course
[1:17:55] he did Brother John he was God in flesh
[1:17:56] amen exactly that's the Revelation you
[1:18:00] need out of all of this God in flesh is
[1:18:02] what's going to take you through this
[1:18:03] amen it's not going to be you it's going
[1:18:05] to be God in flesh you've got to be in
[1:18:07] Christ and Christ has to be in you and
[1:18:09] then you can in all points be tempted
[1:18:11] and come through Victorious maybe not on
[1:18:13] the first try maybe not on the second
[1:18:15] try but you'll be victorious because
[1:18:17] it's only to the Overcomer that the gift
[1:18:19] is given at the end it's only to the the
[1:18:21] Overcomer that the throne is given in
[1:18:23] the end you have to overcome therefore
[1:18:25] he's going to make sure you've got the
[1:18:27] victory that you need amen if you get
[1:18:29] the same thing he did amen
[1:18:31] you say he had it easier than I do he
[1:18:34] came down in a special body and he was
[1:18:36] the fullness of the godhead bodily in
[1:18:38] the he had the Holy Spirit without
[1:18:40] measure he didn't have the battle I have
[1:18:42] guess what the scripture says different
[1:18:44] scripture says different in Hebrews 5.
[1:18:47] says so also Christ glorified not
[1:18:50] himself to be made a high priest but
[1:18:52] that he said unto him Thou Art my son
[1:18:55] today have I begotten thee as he saith
[1:18:57] also in another place thou art a priest
[1:18:59] Forever After the order of Melchizedek
[1:19:01] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:19:04] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:19:06] with strong crying and tears unto him
[1:19:10] that was able to save him from death and
[1:19:12] was heard and that he feared though he
[1:19:15] were a son yet learned he obedience by
[1:19:18] the things which he suffered
[1:19:20] he learned obedience how by suffering
[1:19:24] Jesus Christ wasn't born knowing all
[1:19:26] things he wasn't born Victorious over
[1:19:28] all things he wasn't born above all
[1:19:30] things he was born below all things and
[1:19:32] he had to rise above it what by obeying
[1:19:35] the word of God from his very youth amen
[1:19:38] he wasn't the scripture says and we'll
[1:19:40] get to it he was not a ready-made savior
[1:19:42] when he was born he had to become a
[1:19:45] savior
[1:19:46] he had to become the anointed one
[1:19:49] he didn't start out
[1:19:52] ready he finished ready
[1:19:55] he was brought to a place he had to grow
[1:19:57] he had to mature he had to be tempted he
[1:19:59] had to be tried he had to be tested he
[1:20:01] had to go through battles he had to get
[1:20:02] the victory the exact same way that you
[1:20:04] and I do
[1:20:05] and guess what his battles were way
[1:20:07] tougher than what we have to deal with
[1:20:09] because every gun that Satan has was
[1:20:12] focused on that one man
[1:20:14] listen he's got to spread out here
[1:20:17] but Jesus had every single gun trained
[1:20:19] on him that hell could train on him amen
[1:20:21] listen Jesus had to find himself in the
[1:20:24] word
[1:20:25] he had to come to a revelation of who he
[1:20:27] was the amazing thing was he had it by
[1:20:29] the age of 12.
[1:20:31] but he still had to come to it he still
[1:20:33] had to come to it amen he had to come to
[1:20:35] a place where he was by not just
[1:20:37] Revelation but by experience what the
[1:20:40] word said he was
[1:20:42] and then when he got there now he could
[1:20:43] do the work that his father had set out
[1:20:45] for him brother Bob says this he says
[1:20:47] you see he himself suffered he learned
[1:20:50] obedience by the things he suffered he
[1:20:52] was actually made perfect made perfect
[1:20:54] by the things which he suffered he reads
[1:20:57] Hebrews 5 there where we just did he
[1:20:59] says in plain language the very
[1:21:01] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:21:04] suffering and according to Paul he has
[1:21:06] left his church a measure of suffering
[1:21:08] that they too by their faith in God
[1:21:10] while suffering for him would come to a
[1:21:13] place of perfection you know what that
[1:21:14] tells me he took the exact same path
[1:21:16] that you and I are going through he
[1:21:19] didn't say just do it he said I've done
[1:21:21] it and now you follow in my path and you
[1:21:23] do the exact same thing
[1:21:25] why did he want this James 1 2-4 says my
[1:21:28] brethren counted all joy when you fall
[1:21:30] into diverse Temptations knowing this
[1:21:32] that the trying of your faith Works
[1:21:34] patience but let patience have her
[1:21:37] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[1:21:40] entire wanting nothing
[1:21:42] so God condescended into a body of Flesh
[1:21:45] to show us the way back and Jesus was
[1:21:47] not exempt from the path that we are
[1:21:49] forced to walk that's what we just read
[1:21:50] there amen his character was molded it
[1:21:53] was shaped it was proven by the things
[1:21:54] that it was that he suffered now you say
[1:21:57] brother John he was perfect so how could
[1:21:59] he be molded
[1:22:01] but remember what the prophet of God
[1:22:03] said character is what a victory
[1:22:07] so your character is molded by what
[1:22:09] trials in which you get the victory so
[1:22:13] his Perfection had to be proven
[1:22:15] and it had to be tried and had to be
[1:22:17] tested and if characters have is a
[1:22:19] victory then that means there had to
[1:22:20] have been a battle that means there had
[1:22:22] to been a test that means there had to
[1:22:23] be a child and I don't know about you
[1:22:24] but I've never been in a trial or a test
[1:22:26] that was easy
[1:22:29] so his character had to be proven
[1:22:31] because God put before him time and time
[1:22:33] again trials and tests and Satan of
[1:22:35] course certainly did it as well and he
[1:22:37] put all of those things there and his
[1:22:40] character was proven by the things that
[1:22:42] he suffered guess what don't think Satan
[1:22:44] gave up after the 40 days in the desert
[1:22:47] after that every gun was trained on him
[1:22:50] and now it was influence and that was
[1:22:52] the the opinions of people and now it
[1:22:54] was the hard work that he had to do and
[1:22:56] it was disciples leaving him and all
[1:22:57] these different things
[1:22:59] people that said they believed and then
[1:23:00] all of a sudden they didn't believe and
[1:23:01] left him and this one and that one amen
[1:23:04] what is it character is proof that God
[1:23:06] has finished the work in you
[1:23:07] in an area
[1:23:09] because for us we don't have character
[1:23:11] everywhere one time do we but God's
[1:23:13] Building us up bit by bit by bit by bit
[1:23:16] so that what when we get to the fine tip
[1:23:18] of the spear everything is well
[1:23:19] supported beneath it so when the
[1:23:21] decision comes the final decision comes
[1:23:23] you make the right one and you step into
[1:23:25] Glory
[1:23:26] Jesus learned obedience by suffering
[1:23:28] through the test of his character if I
[1:23:31] could flip it around I would say Jesus
[1:23:32] learned that obedience always includes
[1:23:34] suffering if you do it according to the
[1:23:36] word of God Amen why because what God
[1:23:39] wants to prove that the words that you
[1:23:40] have are not just stuck on your tongue
[1:23:42] but they're inscribed in your heart amen
[1:23:44] that they can't be Stamped Out they
[1:23:46] can't be rubbed away with an eraser of
[1:23:48] influence or or shame or or somebody
[1:23:50] trying to put you down but that they're
[1:23:52] engraved in there and they won't go out
[1:23:53] and that you'll always stick to what the
[1:23:55] word says in that situation
[1:23:57] amen the prophet continues he says in
[1:24:00] his own personal life contending with
[1:24:03] himself
[1:24:04] speaking of Christ contending with
[1:24:07] himself he overcame by obedience to the
[1:24:10] word of God and then he reads the
[1:24:13] scripture we just read he says what was
[1:24:14] he obedient to the word of God
[1:24:17] prophet of God says Jesus had to contend
[1:24:19] with himself you say what did he have to
[1:24:22] contend with he was perfect he was
[1:24:24] Christ he was the anointed one but
[1:24:26] remember you say he had what he had
[1:24:28] flaws cracks in his armors no but he was
[1:24:31] in a human body that could be tempted so
[1:24:34] he had to contend with the things you do
[1:24:36] he had to contend with emotions he had
[1:24:38] to contend with hormones he had to
[1:24:40] contend with being tired
[1:24:42] and be disappointed in people and being
[1:24:45] shamed and being rejected and all these
[1:24:46] things he had to contend with the body
[1:24:48] that he was in wanting to do what yours
[1:24:51] and mine does every single day
[1:24:53] that's what he was dealing with amen he
[1:24:56] didn't have an easy Road and he was a
[1:24:57] target for every devil that was out
[1:24:58] there
[1:25:00] so he's contending with a body that had
[1:25:02] to make a choice every single time
[1:25:05] because that's all Adam and Eve had to
[1:25:06] do make a choice
[1:25:08] and he was in that body that's why
[1:25:10] that's why the scripture calls him the
[1:25:11] second Adam was because he went down and
[1:25:13] he came into a body just like Adam and
[1:25:15] he overcame where Adam fell but he had
[1:25:18] to make the same choices and we'll get
[1:25:19] into it in the morning moment
[1:25:21] first Peter 2 says for even here unto
[1:25:24] where you called because Christ also
[1:25:26] suffered for us what leaving an example
[1:25:29] that you should follow in his steps
[1:25:33] that you would go the exact same way he
[1:25:35] did and have the exact same results that
[1:25:38] he had as well
[1:25:39] who did no sin neither was guile found
[1:25:42] in his mouth that means there was no
[1:25:43] deception no hypocrisy and no craftiness
[1:25:47] listen this is the example that we're
[1:25:49] supposed to follow now who when he was
[1:25:51] reviled reviled not again
[1:25:54] when he suffered he threatened not but
[1:25:57] committed himself to him that judges
[1:26:00] righteously if we could do that when
[1:26:03] we're getting reviled when we're getting
[1:26:05] judged when things are misspoken about
[1:26:07] us when things are put out of context
[1:26:10] what that we could commit ourselves and
[1:26:12] say God you take care of it I'm just
[1:26:14] going to keep walking
[1:26:16] said who his own self bear our sins in
[1:26:19] his own body on the tree that we being
[1:26:21] dead to sins should live unto
[1:26:23] righteousness by whose Stripes ye were
[1:26:26] healed so in all of that testing Christ
[1:26:29] was obedient to the word of God and he
[1:26:31] came through Victorious and that's why
[1:26:34] God said there on Mount Transfiguration
[1:26:36] he says what this is my beloved Son and
[1:26:38] whom I am well pleased hear ye him he
[1:26:41] had passed every test and that's where
[1:26:43] he stepped into what the fullness and
[1:26:45] that's where he said all that's what all
[1:26:47] power in Heaven and Earth is given to
[1:26:48] him
[1:26:49] potentially it was right there because
[1:26:51] God said you did the job you've met you
[1:26:53] have the seal of approval you're good to
[1:26:55] go
[1:26:57] Hebrews 5 and verse 9 says I'm being
[1:26:59] made perfect
[1:27:00] he became the author of Eternal
[1:27:02] salvation unto all them that today that
[1:27:04] obey him so he was born and he was built
[1:27:07] to bring Salvation but he was not there
[1:27:10] when he was born
[1:27:11] you and I are in the same boat
[1:27:13] you're born to go in a Rapture you're
[1:27:16] born to be resurrected you're born to be
[1:27:17] the word for your day but you're not
[1:27:19] born that way
[1:27:20] you gotta have a new birth
[1:27:23] that lets you start the way he started
[1:27:25] and then you got to have the same spirit
[1:27:26] inside of you that he did that'll give
[1:27:28] you the same victory that he did so that
[1:27:30] you can what be made for perfect and
[1:27:33] become the bride of Christ
[1:27:35] it's the same path it's the exact same
[1:27:37] thing being made perfect the proper word
[1:27:39] there in the original language means to
[1:27:41] be completed to bring to the goal or
[1:27:43] purpose so he was brought to completion
[1:27:46] he became a finished work
[1:27:49] he became a finished work the scriptures
[1:27:52] then says he became the author of
[1:27:54] Salvation when when he was made perfect
[1:27:56] when he became a completed work amen he
[1:27:59] still had to come to the place where he
[1:28:01] was what the word said he would be
[1:28:03] that was growth that was maturity that
[1:28:05] was testing that was trying and then he
[1:28:07] finally stepped right into it amen and
[1:28:10] all the way up to Gethsemane he had to
[1:28:11] fight his entire life
[1:28:13] he had to make the right decisions time
[1:28:15] and time and time again all the way up
[1:28:17] to Gethsemane amen
[1:28:19] you had to fight the inclinations of the
[1:28:20] body to do what self-preserve
[1:28:23] to lean to pleasure to lead to lean to
[1:28:25] ease of life to fund the good times
[1:28:28] to doing what the crowd wants rather
[1:28:30] than what the word says every day of his
[1:28:33] life was filled with controversy because
[1:28:34] he had the word and then he had just
[1:28:36] about everybody else saying don't do it
[1:28:37] and every influence that was out there
[1:28:39] from the spiritual side from the
[1:28:41] ministry side from the people every one
[1:28:43] of them or bending it you can be the
[1:28:45] Messiah Jesus but take the Romans out
[1:28:48] be a different Messiah than the word
[1:28:49] says you're supposed to be constantly
[1:28:51] all the time he was in a battle
[1:28:54] Philippians 2 says this let this mind be
[1:28:57] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:28:59] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:29:01] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:29:04] made himself of no reputation and took
[1:29:07] upon him the form of a servant and was
[1:29:10] made in the likeness of men and being
[1:29:12] found in fashion as a man what did he do
[1:29:15] he humbled himself
[1:29:17] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:29:22] death of the Christ of the Cross so
[1:29:25] catch us he humbled himself and became
[1:29:27] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:29:29] the Cross why is humbly needed if he's
[1:29:31] already perfect
[1:29:34] why is obedience needed if he doesn't
[1:29:36] have another preference of opinion or
[1:29:37] opinion listen it's not wrong to have a
[1:29:40] preference or opinion scripture doesn't
[1:29:42] say you're not allowed to prefer not to
[1:29:45] take the harder Road
[1:29:47] right it's not wrong to say Lord I'd
[1:29:51] really rather not go this route
[1:29:54] as Christ said the very same thing amen
[1:29:57] listen Christ never said
[1:30:00] the Christian life was easy you might go
[1:30:01] that scripture it says my yoke is easy
[1:30:03] and his burden is light but he says to
[1:30:05] the disciples I'm sending you out as
[1:30:07] sheeps Among Wolves
[1:30:08] right every gun in hell is turned on you
[1:30:11] people are going to reject you they're
[1:30:12] going to kill you they're going to
[1:30:13] betray you all these different things
[1:30:14] and it hasn't ended today it's still
[1:30:17] there even amongst family even amongst
[1:30:19] message Believers at times amen there
[1:30:21] are guns trained on you every day of
[1:30:23] your life why did he have to Humble
[1:30:25] himself if there wasn't something that
[1:30:27] would resist that
[1:30:28] and there was something that was
[1:30:30] resisted his will was let this cup
[1:30:33] Pastor me his preference not his will
[1:30:36] his preference was he says if it's
[1:30:37] possible Lord let this cup pass for me
[1:30:40] don't make me go by way of the cross
[1:30:43] don't make me go this agonizing death
[1:30:45] don't let me be naked in front of all
[1:30:47] these people don't let me go through the
[1:30:49] most horrible death a man has ever
[1:30:50] experienced don't let me do it
[1:30:52] but then he said what not my will but
[1:30:55] thine be done and we've got to do the
[1:30:57] same thing we can say Lord I'd really
[1:30:58] prefer not to go this route
[1:31:01] but we still got to walk the way he says
[1:31:03] to walk if he says to walk it amen
[1:31:05] listen Christ he believed the word of
[1:31:07] God and he believed the word of God
[1:31:09] Scripture says here till what he became
[1:31:11] obedient to death his obedience took him
[1:31:13] all the way down into hell past death
[1:31:16] into hell and then back up in newness of
[1:31:18] life and all the way back up to heaven
[1:31:19] where he came from in the first place
[1:31:21] and we've got to believe the exact same
[1:31:22] way
[1:31:23] we've got to believe the exact same way
[1:31:24] we've got to believe unto a dying of
[1:31:26] ourselves
[1:31:27] of everything that we have of everything
[1:31:29] we provided of every skill of every gift
[1:31:31] we have and we've got to be able to lay
[1:31:33] it down and say Lord I'm going to trust
[1:31:34] you to bring me up in newness of life
[1:31:36] that you that that as the word says I've
[1:31:38] never seen the righteous forsaken nor a
[1:31:41] seed begging bread that he would he
[1:31:43] would give it to us pressed down shaken
[1:31:44] together until it's pouring out that he
[1:31:47] would give us family that he would give
[1:31:48] us houses that he would give us
[1:31:49] Fellowship that he would give us food in
[1:31:51] due season all of those things but we've
[1:31:53] got to be willing like Jesus to become
[1:31:55] obedient to dying out to everything else
[1:31:57] that could be self-fulfilling that could
[1:31:59] provide for our own selves
[1:32:02] prophet of God says and no one will ever
[1:32:04] know what agapo love meant to stoop down
[1:32:07] and to condescend to the lowest pits of
[1:32:11] the lowest hell to bring the Fallen
[1:32:13] creature from a creature of time to a
[1:32:16] creature of Eternity he says we could
[1:32:18] not express it
[1:32:20] we can't even understand what that was
[1:32:22] he said God himself Jehovah lived in
[1:32:25] Christ and was made a Kinsman to us
[1:32:27] because he was born in human flesh like
[1:32:29] we are is that right the blood cells
[1:32:32] were developed by God and the flesh
[1:32:33] cells were developed in the womb of Mary
[1:32:35] that brought forth the child and God
[1:32:37] came down and lived in human flesh and
[1:32:40] was tempted in every manner just like we
[1:32:42] are do you believe that he says all
[1:32:44] right he says now then when he did that
[1:32:46] he freely gave his blood he didn't have
[1:32:50] to do it
[1:32:52] he made that sacrifice
[1:32:56] he would say in the message desperations
[1:32:58] our dear Lord Jesus himself in the
[1:33:00] world's greatest Battleground Gethsemane
[1:33:02] he cried out in despair here's the
[1:33:05] question should he take the sins of the
[1:33:07] world or should he just remain on Earth
[1:33:10] with his beloved disciples what he
[1:33:12] wanted to do
[1:33:13] but watch his humility as he humbled
[1:33:15] himself not my will but thine be done he
[1:33:19] humbled himself to the word the promised
[1:33:22] word of the god of Heaven
[1:33:24] notice then he went a little further and
[1:33:27] if he went a little further how much
[1:33:30] more are we to go a little further see
[1:33:33] you notice the scripture says here in
[1:33:34] Luke that he prayed earnestly brother
[1:33:37] sister if Jesus had to pray honestly how
[1:33:40] much more have we got to pray earnestly
[1:33:43] if Christ the god of Heaven made flesh
[1:33:46] had to pray earnestly then how much more
[1:33:48] we Sinners saved by grace pray earnestly
[1:33:51] if the decision throw the Son of God
[1:33:53] into despair what will it do to you and
[1:33:56] I desperately we must cry God in these
[1:34:00] last days has manifested himself so To
[1:34:03] Us by his Great Signs and power should
[1:34:05] make us desperate that's right and he's
[1:34:09] where and his willing to heal us and
[1:34:11] save us
[1:34:12] ought to throw us all into desperation
[1:34:14] to get to that healing stone he said
[1:34:18] what desperately we must cry out what
[1:34:20] that it should pass
[1:34:22] no what that we would find and accept
[1:34:26] the will of God in our life and that as
[1:34:29] we will believe the word he's given us
[1:34:31] for our day and time and make it happen
[1:34:33] in our own lives in these own bodies in
[1:34:35] the sinful flesh amen that we would take
[1:34:37] a hold of the word of God he's talking
[1:34:39] there about God in signs and wonders
[1:34:41] where in his ministry a first fruit a a
[1:34:45] wave offering before us and he's saying
[1:34:46] you ought to be in a desperation to have
[1:34:49] the same reality of God in your life
[1:34:50] that's been demonstrated before you here
[1:34:52] tonight
[1:34:54] that you would have the same sincerity
[1:34:56] that you would have the same commitment
[1:34:59] that you would have the the same Focus
[1:35:01] that you would have your life cleaned
[1:35:03] out so that God can use you in a way
[1:35:04] like he was using that man there'll
[1:35:06] never be another William Branham on this
[1:35:07] Earth We're not looking for that that
[1:35:09] was a son of man revealing the son of
[1:35:11] man he said that was a special Ministry
[1:35:13] but God's looking to use you as purely
[1:35:15] as he did with William Branham that he
[1:35:17] could lead us that he could guide us
[1:35:19] that he could take us to a path to a
[1:35:20] Rapture amen
[1:35:24] why so that when the decision is tough
[1:35:26] the toughness doesn't hold us back from
[1:35:28] taking what the word of God says we
[1:35:30] ought to do amen
[1:35:32] he says oh God project your love to the
[1:35:35] lost tonight let them know what you did
[1:35:38] when you came here to the Earth and died
[1:35:40] in their stead was made ugly and made
[1:35:43] death for them God made death The
[1:35:46] Immortal God humbled himself in the womb
[1:35:48] of a woman to become death and sin to
[1:35:51] take our ugliness and guiltiness away
[1:35:53] from us oh it's too much for My Heart
[1:35:55] Lord I just can't understand it why did
[1:35:59] you do it
[1:36:00] why Church why did he do it we've been
[1:36:03] covering it to redeem you but not to
[1:36:06] redeem you back to stuff
[1:36:08] not to bring you back to a worldly
[1:36:10] Kingdom but to redeem you back to
[1:36:12] fellowship with him and the blessings
[1:36:15] that come with Fellowship so often we're
[1:36:17] looking for the blessings but not the
[1:36:19] fellowship the blessings are in the
[1:36:21] fellowship that's really where you need
[1:36:22] it in his presence that's where I am
[1:36:24] loved that's where I have peace and joy
[1:36:26] and rest amen that's what we want is the
[1:36:29] fruit of the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:36:30] fruit that doesn't pass away
[1:36:33] prophet of God goes into into a very
[1:36:36] long quote here but he kind of takes
[1:36:37] this whole sermon and he condenses it
[1:36:39] down into about eight paragraphs and I
[1:36:41] just want to read them as we start to
[1:36:42] close this evening
[1:36:44] he said God came down in a blood cell
[1:36:46] not through a man but by the Holy Ghost
[1:36:49] and in that virgin room a tabernacle for
[1:36:52] the purpose of death was built a
[1:36:55] tabernacle for the purpose of death
[1:36:57] you talk about a condescending God
[1:37:00] he didn't even know what death was
[1:37:04] and he built something to experience
[1:37:06] something that a God is never supposed
[1:37:07] to experience
[1:37:09] woman came in order that he will be
[1:37:11] bruised to bring us our Salvation when
[1:37:13] the Holy Ghost Came Upon Mary he created
[1:37:16] within her womb the cell that would
[1:37:18] multiply and become the body of Our Lord
[1:37:20] that cell was created it was the
[1:37:23] beginning of the creation of God that is
[1:37:25] who Jesus is and that Holy One was
[1:37:28] filled with Holy Blood even the blood of
[1:37:30] God that Tabernacle came to birth
[1:37:33] he grew to be a man he went to Jordan
[1:37:36] and there that sacrifice was washed of
[1:37:38] John in the river called Jordan when
[1:37:41] that acceptable sacrifice rose out of
[1:37:43] the water God came and indwelt him
[1:37:44] filling him with the spirit without
[1:37:46] measure and when he died and shed his
[1:37:49] blood the perfect life of God was
[1:37:51] liberated to come back upon the sinner
[1:37:53] who would accept the Christ as his
[1:37:55] savior he says oh how striking it is
[1:37:58] listen to this now
[1:38:00] Jehovah born crying over a manure pile
[1:38:05] Jehovah born in a manger of straw there
[1:38:09] is your Everlasting sign to the proud
[1:38:11] and puffed up
[1:38:13] pseudo-intellectuals who have evolved
[1:38:15] their own Theology and denied the truth
[1:38:17] of God
[1:38:18] Jehovah God a crying baby in a stinking
[1:38:22] Barn this is the condescending God now
[1:38:25] they think we have a right to be proud
[1:38:27] holding up our nose noses criticizing
[1:38:30] and acting as though we were somebody
[1:38:32] here's your real sign this is the right
[1:38:35] one Jehovah playing as a boy Jehovah
[1:38:39] working in a carpenter shop Jehovah
[1:38:41] washing the feet of fishermen I'll give
[1:38:45] you a sign say God not the sign of a
[1:38:48] white-collar priesthood not the sign of
[1:38:50] wealth and power there's nothing in this
[1:38:53] sign that you will want or think
[1:38:54] suitable but it is an everlasting sign
[1:38:57] and it is the greatest sign of whole of
[1:39:00] all
[1:39:00] listen now Jehovah standing in the
[1:39:04] courtyard bruised and bleeding with
[1:39:05] thorns on his brow and spit on his face
[1:39:08] mocked and said it not Jehovah despised
[1:39:11] and rejected hanging naked upon the
[1:39:13] cross while the Hypocrites jeered and
[1:39:16] dared him to come down off the cross
[1:39:18] Jehovah dying
[1:39:20] now catch this last bit Jehovah praying
[1:39:24] and nothing happening
[1:39:26] and then Jehovah died amen
[1:39:32] the condescending God
[1:39:35] couldn't even have a prayer answered at
[1:39:37] the end died a sinful man
[1:39:42] he died screaming out to the father that
[1:39:44] had forsaken him
[1:39:46] and then he died
[1:39:48] condescending God amen that is the sign
[1:39:51] for all men now there isn't another like
[1:39:54] it it is the great one then Darkness
[1:39:56] Came Upon the Earth they put him in a
[1:39:58] tomb there he lay those three days and
[1:40:00] nights until an earthquake shattered the
[1:40:02] Gloom of night and he came forth Jehovah
[1:40:05] came forth Jehovah ascended on high now
[1:40:09] listen here then Jehovah returned to
[1:40:12] indwell his church Jehovah came back
[1:40:15] with a mighty rushing wind and flames of
[1:40:17] fire Jehovah came back to walk in the
[1:40:21] midst of his church and Empower his
[1:40:23] people
[1:40:24] once more Jehovah came and this time to
[1:40:28] stay in his people what is it the
[1:40:32] condescending God and again Jehovah
[1:40:34] heals the sick raises the dead and
[1:40:37] manifests himself by the spirit Jehovah
[1:40:39] came back speaking in tongues and giving
[1:40:41] the answer back in interpretation
[1:40:44] Jehovah came down and he raised The
[1:40:46] Prostitute to sin no more he came down
[1:40:49] to the druckard with blowflies on his
[1:40:51] face as he lays unconscious in the
[1:40:54] gutter yes Jehovah came to manifest in
[1:40:57] flesh and manifest through flesh Jehovah
[1:41:01] came God in us the hope of glory yes
[1:41:04] Jesus came and shed his blood and set
[1:41:07] the captive free he came and redeemed
[1:41:09] his lost sheep he gave them eternal life
[1:41:12] and they shall never perish he won't
[1:41:15] lose one of them but raise them up at
[1:41:17] the last day Hallelujah the second death
[1:41:20] cannot hurt them it has no power over
[1:41:22] them for they are the Lambs and they
[1:41:24] follow him wherever he goes
[1:41:29] amen he didn't just condescend in
[1:41:31] Bethlehem in a Manger
[1:41:33] but he condescended to dwell in sinful
[1:41:35] flesh again on the day of Pentecost and
[1:41:37] the prophet of God says and he is never
[1:41:39] going to leave her again
[1:41:41] that he stays there and he heals the
[1:41:43] sick and he delivers the bound and he
[1:41:45] opens prison doors and he makes us into
[1:41:47] what he says we would be amen
[1:41:50] it's amazing what he's done Church
[1:41:54] it's amazing what he did he condescended
[1:41:58] so that he could identify with us
[1:42:00] but so that he could take us out of it
[1:42:02] as well and he proved it could be done
[1:42:04] because he did it and listen he's not
[1:42:06] holding back to make sure that we aren't
[1:42:08] held back either he's gone what he's
[1:42:10] come down and he's manifested in flesh
[1:42:13] again so that you can have the same
[1:42:14] victory that you can overcome as he did
[1:42:16] why because you get the same result he
[1:42:19] did you get the same reward you get to
[1:42:21] sit in the throne with him that's how
[1:42:22] you know your path is the same as his
[1:42:24] it's because you get the same reward he
[1:42:26] gets
[1:42:27] because what's by his spirit
[1:42:29] you're going to have the exact same
[1:42:30] effect amen
[1:42:33] he's not he's not asleep
[1:42:36] he's not ignorant of what's going on
[1:42:38] he's not laying down
[1:42:40] he's not taking a break he's not
[1:42:42] watching the hockey game
[1:42:43] though it seems like it sometimes
[1:42:46] seems nothing's happening
[1:42:49] but the word is always working it's
[1:42:52] always working amen it's it's bread on
[1:42:54] the water and it won't come back without
[1:42:56] performing that which it was sent out to
[1:42:58] do
[1:42:59] I want to share one final quote and
[1:43:01] let's stand together if we would
[1:43:03] and so quote brother Branham shares and
[1:43:06] he's talking about the children of
[1:43:07] Israel and they're in the desert
[1:43:09] they're going around and around in the
[1:43:11] desert and God keeps showing them mercy
[1:43:13] and grace and mercy and Grace and they
[1:43:15] get themselves into trouble and more
[1:43:17] trouble and more trouble and they got to
[1:43:18] the place where their trouble was death
[1:43:21] but they were dying
[1:43:22] and he says now we find them after this
[1:43:24] time murmuring again weakened in faith
[1:43:28] after God had showed Mercy on them it
[1:43:31] amazes me sometimes the the the the
[1:43:33] supernatural that God showed to the
[1:43:35] children of Israel listen they went 40
[1:43:37] years in the desert and the clothes
[1:43:38] never wore out the food never went away
[1:43:40] the shoes were as good as gold all the
[1:43:42] way through they have food every day
[1:43:44] they had a pillar of Fire by night they
[1:43:47] had a cloud by day
[1:43:48] God was constantly they had a daily
[1:43:51] Supernatural event in their life just
[1:43:53] with the manna and yet they kept turning
[1:43:56] their back on God and disbelieving him
[1:43:58] he says weakened in faith after God had
[1:44:00] showed Mercy them and we find them
[1:44:02] murmuring with God and when they did
[1:44:04] they were dying with snake bites well
[1:44:07] they deserved it
[1:44:08] they certainly did anybody that would
[1:44:11] mistake God's word and do these things
[1:44:12] that they did they deserved to die
[1:44:17] we deserve to die when we disbelieve
[1:44:21] every one of them
[1:44:23] desired and deserved to die in the
[1:44:25] wilderness but when they were so sick
[1:44:27] that even Dr Moses and none of them
[1:44:29] could do anything about it and they were
[1:44:31] dying by the thousands but God rich in
[1:44:34] Mercy he made a way of Escape for those
[1:44:37] who would believe him
[1:44:39] catch this next bit he says he made an
[1:44:42] antidote for it by setting up a brass
[1:44:44] serpent God made a way of Escape so his
[1:44:47] believing children could be healed
[1:44:49] he says God is interested in everything
[1:44:53] that's wrong
[1:44:55] everything that you participate in
[1:44:58] every Walk of Life God is interested in
[1:45:01] you you are his child and he is rich in
[1:45:05] Mercy he wants to do it for you amen
[1:45:09] reminds me of Joel 2 28 where he says
[1:45:11] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:45:14] you can be black you can be white you
[1:45:17] can be brown you can be yellow and
[1:45:19] whatever color there is in humanity you
[1:45:22] can come from any color color you can
[1:45:24] come from any race you can come from any
[1:45:25] religion any family you can come from
[1:45:28] any broken down situation you want and
[1:45:31] he says I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[1:45:32] Flesh man women slaves free it doesn't
[1:45:36] matter why because he's interested in
[1:45:38] where you're at so that he can bring you
[1:45:41] out of it and take you to where you're
[1:45:42] supposed to be amen the condescending
[1:45:45] god listen this wasn't just a sermon
[1:45:47] that that brother Brown preached in
[1:45:49] 1965. this is a sermon that has
[1:45:51] continued to this day that he is
[1:45:53] interested in where you're at he's
[1:45:57] interested in your faults in your flaws
[1:45:59] in your cracks in your armor he's
[1:46:01] interested in your failures he's
[1:46:03] introduced introdu interested in what
[1:46:05] you failed at this morning what you
[1:46:07] failed at the day before he's interested
[1:46:09] in your your habits that are tripping
[1:46:11] you up he's interested in the
[1:46:12] relationships that are causing you
[1:46:14] problems he's interested in the apps on
[1:46:16] your phone that you ought not to have
[1:46:17] he's interested in whatever it is that
[1:46:19] you're dealing with so that he can come
[1:46:21] in and he can show you there's a victory
[1:46:23] that you can have beyond the cement I'm
[1:46:25] an experience of it and I'm continuing
[1:46:27] to be an experience of it amen not as if
[1:46:30] I have attained but I've seen the
[1:46:31] victory that comes when you die out and
[1:46:33] you let the Holy Spirit have its way in
[1:46:35] your life amen what is it the
[1:46:36] condescending God that would condescend
[1:46:39] into Jonathan curlette that would
[1:46:41] condescend in each and every one here if
[1:46:42] you let him that he could what raise you
[1:46:44] up to where he is he condescends to your
[1:46:47] place to raise you up to his place
[1:46:49] that's the kind of God that we're
[1:46:51] serving this evening amen aren't you
[1:46:54] thankful amen let's bow our heads
[1:46:56] together Heavenly Father

[1:47:19] you had to deal with the thoughts and
[1:47:20] the impulses Lord and the Lord the
[1:47:23] difficulties that we face in this human
[1:47:24] life Lord and yet you went through a
