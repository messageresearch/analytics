closer walk a man thank God for glory there won't be no microphones amen there won't be no recordings a man praise the name of the Lord is all gonna be eternal a man we want to remember everything we're gonna know it all but that what we need to know that way by the grace of God a man's abrasive evil Lord God help us brother is my prayer that we're going to be closer to him and brother just if the bride is experiencing anything in these last days it's a closer walk a man that we're getting closer to the Lord and getting closer to the resurrection than the others were in previous ages so god help us to appreciate what God has done that was to appreciate what God is doing amen brother again we're praying grace to God help us to get into the revelation of the perfect faith of rapturing faith amen and brother I will get into that eventually exactly what what is the attributes of perfect faith what are the attributes a man arrived free faith what are we going to experience what are you going to see in the bride a man well what you saw in the bridegroom you'll see in the right amen praise the name of the Lord too often people got this idea that idea this idea so on no no go back to the scripture and see what God has done and see what God is doing in the types in examples a man that our faith be in God a man that our faith be in the Word of God remembers Genesis to Revelation and he hasn't changed it a man he's not going to change it everything that God has done and everything that God will do and everything God is doing is going to be according to us written here in this book a man so brothers there's when it comes to a mystery it's the mystery of God revealed a man but it's revealed only to the elect a man even unto the resurrection even unto the rapture again as the prophet of God has said and he said the thing of it is they're looking for the resurrection looking with a rapture but he should they missed what God has done a man they think God yet they want God to do this Nathan want God to do that and they think oh this is the Lord this is how God's going to do it this is not no no God's not going to do it the way they think God's going to do it according to his word a man and the Lord willing we're going to bring those things up because I want to get into the revelation of the right revival a man and I turned it is not going to be a revival like they think a man and it's not a revival even like a lot of believers thing oh no not by any means a man the problem of God I lighted those things and not only that when it comes to the revival the way that man thinks of revivals and Holy Ghost revivals and all that he said he said no no he said that that's gone he's that's over with and he said I know he should they're looking for revival and signs and wonders revival they're looking for a first and a second pull revival but they brought that prophet of God is putting us through the third pull revival a man and what what effect we would have in your life what effect will it have in the end the life of the break amen I turned to this it's not gonna be what they think they met so output god help us to be sincere god help us to be serious a man that we really really want to be a part of the bride revival a man so let's make sure that whereas I have Saul ready preached on it we're hearing it and seeing it the way we should that we got right motives and right objectives a man and and brother sister what is it it's all based on the word a man it all comes from the word it all takes us back to the word a man and it's what a man is what God's looking for it's not what mans looking for man's ideas what is God's idea a man what does God said in his word and I don't know if you know this but I mentioned maybe a number of years ago that concerning the the center of the Bible of this book a man what is the center verse of the Bible what is the center of Revelation of the Bible is tremendous and it's in sums 118 and is verse 8 that is the middle of the Bible a man the number of verses before this is the same as the number of verses after this and just consider it says it is better what we want much better and it is better to trust in the Lord Amen them to put confidence in name praise the name of the Lord that's the middle of the Bible that is the middle revelation a man that God is Porteous to and brother are we gonna look back to that a man it is God getting us to trust in the Lord not by the confidence in Maine they may it because mean even when it comes to things that are religious not all let's trust in the Lord let's be spiritual not religious a man by the grace of Almighty God that Psalms 118 verse 8 a man so god help us brother they were going to that a man it was over an hour that God is looking for that in his people it's this hour a man because if we going to get into the resurrection the rapture we got to trust in the Lord amen not putting our confidence in man it's in the Lord and brother where is our faith in God is in the word faith comes by hearing hearing by the word a man thank God sir brother let's give God the glory amen this standard sing only believe all things are possible only believe as we go to the word Oh [Music] Oh [Music] all things are possible Oh [Music] hey hey man Lily eating your heart believe it in your soul hey man all things are possible only believe a may believe it slowly a man [Music] Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah because Jesus a man after 2,000 years our Lord Jesus Christ is still in pain he is with us he is in us [Music] Oh blossom oh Jesus [Music] next believe the word hey man there's believed what God wants us to believe Hey yes Lord I believe hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord [Music] Oh Lord [Music] No Oh matzo ball Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lord it's a challenge to pray is a challenge to trust you the Lord especially in this hour especially Lord in this age Lord considering the hour that we live in considering the age we're living considering the insanity of the world fathers getting stronger and a stronger challenge Lord to trust you a strong and a stronger challenge to believe you Lord so that our faith in our confidence Lord is not in maeín but it's in God Father for the bride is coming to that place Lord where we have no other confidence we have no other faith but faith in God father that there is nothing else that we can do except believe God nothing else we can do except trust you nor we're praying Grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ any man in this our Father where it is written that the love of many shall wax cold father where it is written Lord that is deceiving and being deceived father again that it is written that if you don't shorten time there would be no flesh saved so we're asking for the grace of God and the anointing of the Holy Ghost father that we will stay with the word nor that we will continue to believe will continue Lord to exorcise me will continue to live Lord and walk by faith a man father again it is living in the spirit and it is walking in the spirit father knowing Lord that the spirit is there Lord hallelujah to vindicate the word the spirit is there Lord hallelujah to reveal the word a man help us Lord that we believe the word it is written nor we are taking our stand for the Lord we're taking our stand for the word father we're not going by feelings when I going by religion we're going by the anointing of the Holy Ghost Nordy of the bride the anointing of the Holy Ghost Lord revealing father hallelujah the of God to the bride the mystery of God through the bride the mystery of God is in the bride how do you help us to believe in Lord Alleluia with an absolute complete belief amen so that there will be no doubt in our hearts no doubt in our minds no doubt in our spirits and or that we have no question father because we believe it is written it is thus saith the Lord amen father we a way that we don't need to ask any questions we don't need to wonder about this we don't need to consider considering water this is the truth your word is the truth amen oh lord grace the lord grace that we can truly say a man nor that we have had your word in our hearts thy word have I hid in my heart a man to believe the complete belief to believe you Lord and what you have done and what you are doing in this day in this hour a man so we're not looking Lord to man we're looking to God we're not seeing what that is doing we're seeing what God and it's done and seen what God is doing amen help us Lord that we're not in the past and Lord is not in the future we're in the present hey babe knowing lore that you had brought the word into the present tense Alleluia so grace that were going for them the present tense revelation of the word the present tense revelation of the Resurrection and the rapture amen it is serious lord help us Lord to be sincere father and to know how serious it is a name Lord knowing what you have done but knowing again Lord that the devil is the god of this world knowing that Satan is taking control more and more and more as Satan is deceiving more grace that will not be deceived amen we need the revelation of who we are amen to know where we come from and where we're going amen so lord I pray that you'll quicken that revelation in our hearts by the grace of God grace Lord forgive us of our sin grace amen Lord to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and grace that we are standing for the truth standing in the truth we're standing in the revelation or Alleluia what you are doing grace to us for your glory your honor your praise grace Lord for our Redemption soul body and spirit in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ [Music] have the faith of God having a faith in God for the glory of God hallelu let's give the glory to Jesus tell of his wonderful law brother sister the love that he had to made on his life for you and me the love that he had to endure and suffer what he suffer amen and he could have called ten thousand angels to destroy the world and set him free but he stayed there hallelujah all glory that we might be set free they knew you wonderful thank you Jesus thank you or please don't ignore the precis pain don't ignore what he did to redeem us don't ignore what he did to bring us to this place here today for his glory is honor in his praise and for our [Music] thank you Jesus to say now I be [Music] all things are possible [Music] praise the Lord glory [Music] Oh possible [Music] praise the Lord a man god bless you turn with me to st. luke's gospel a man chapter 6 st. luke's gospel chapter 6 praise the name of the lord and the grace of god to her brother Matthew brother Joseph in central new FLANN at this time and pray god bless their fellowship Amen with the Saints and to grant them success in the journey as they go hunting a man but may they on tout the believers first a man and God will give them what they're looking for in the wilderness but you know we're in a wilderness the believers out there no matter where they are they're in a wilderness a man saw God's grace to help us and also to say let you know that the Lord willing next Sunday we'll have communion a man that'll be the first Sunday of November and of course the following Sunday after that brother Jonathan Colette will be here to administer the word and he'll minister on Jimmy are meant to be ministering on on Saturday evening and Sunday morning or nearly would be maybe Friday evening as well but our brother because of his work won't be able to arrive here on the late Friday night so being prayer for brother Jonathan a man at this time and I understand that sister Blanca is expecting a child so we pray the grace of God be with her Amen I don't think she'll be coming no so we prayed god bless her amen and again we pray the grace of God that whatever is his will for the saints in central New flan that those maybe that would be interested in our brother's ministry that the Lord would lead them maybe to come in and fellowship with us around the word when our brother Jonathan is here so God's grace to us a bit you got it remember we got to be in prayer for it asking you'll receive seek your fine knocking I'll be open you said you got to show your interest a man you got to show that you're hungry you're thirsty you want this you recognize your need for it and we then we need the word a man and it's not just entertainment but it's the going further the word because pain comes by hearing and hearing by the word a man so God's God have mercy on us that again no matter what what ministering brother we would have here you're not it's not into the brother it's into the word amen cuz we're cuz the the brother passes away but the word will never pass away a man to God be the glory so we got to get into the eternal by the grace of God and also think sister Priscilla for the song she sang it was it was a blessing a man so god bless her praise the name of the Lord so keeping prayer for the Bride of Christ we're at the end we're at the end so let's make sure we're getting into the bride revival not just an intellectual revival amen it's the bravery Bible it's not just all this doctrine and that dr. Noah and thank the Lord for this and thank the Lord for that no you've got to get into the revelation a man that God is working on in this hour in this age the revelation is looking for in you and me amen not the revelation of the past but the revelation of the present tense amen let's make sure that we're if you if you're experienced a revival make sure you got that a man because I want to share some quotes with the regarding revival and it's tremendous a man it is absolutely tremendous and especially concerning the bright revival and the velvet of Gaza is not like those revivals back there no no he said that's what they're looking for but he said no no they missed it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah he said they missed it so I pray God we're not gonna miss the briber by a man so in June st. Luke's Gospel chapter 6 and beginning to read at verse 40 the sable is not above his master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master a man that's tremendous and why be olace now the mote that is in thy brother's eye but perceive is not the beam that is in thine own eye you find fault with your brother you got a bigger fault a man if you're gonna focus on your brother's fault you better go and focus on your own ain't man cuz it's worse so the disabled know and YB oldest of the mote that is in thy brother's eye but perceive us not the beam that is in thine own eye a man look at yourself either how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself me oldest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite this is how God sees us a man thou hypocrite cast out first two beam out of thine own eye and then thou shalt see clearly to pull out that mote that is in thy brother's eye you got to have a right attitude and a right spirit you're not seeing what's in the brother or the sister to condemn them no no so that God loves you see this and see that so you can pray for them and help them amen but too often the individuals that are self righteous they're there to see this and condemn this one see that and condemn that one and no no that's that's not God God don't do that a man so we gotta have and thus rid of the Lord look at what the Jesus did when he saw that we saw the the motes in our eyes and he saw the the sin in our lives a mayor he wasn't there to condemn us he was there to lay down his life worse a mayor and the same thing with believers today you're not here to condemn you're there to lay down your life you're there to help you're there to encourage you're there to pray amen because there goes you but for the grace of God a man so god help us to have that right attitude and that right spirit I'll show you this that's the only thing that's going in a resurrection that's the only thing that's going in a rapture is the right attitude and erase mirror a man so Jesus could have done this could have done that Tenzin's they could have called ten legions of angels to destroy the world and set him free but for your sake and my sake he stayed there amen for the sake of those that that were that were being done below the cross he could have done this could have done that but he stayed there a man so thank God for such grace brother do we have that grace for one another a man god help us and he said either okay so say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote mote that is in thine eye he said when though they shall be oldest not the beam that is in thine own eye because she's the greater stumbling block in your life then he sees from the other person's like a man they're epic rrett cast out the first two beam that out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit for every tree is known by his own fruit a man for the full of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a bramble bush to gather the grapes a good man out of the good treasure of his heart a man praying we got the good treasure of God in our hearts and that's Greece any man grace to us and we're going to reflect that grace to others a man so him a good man that of the good treasure of his heart bringing for that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringing for that which is evil for the abundance of the heart is mouth speaking a man this is tremendous Amen so brother let our conversation reflect the grace of God and the love of God because I tell you God is love and what did what a divine Lord project grace a man and what a grace for Jack faith revelation that we needed for salvation amen praise the Lord predator from the abundance of the heart is mouth speaketh brother just sing when it comes to your conversation and what you say and what you're oh yeah it tells what's in your heart a man is it the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is it is it Christ anointing your heart or is it the devil anointing you amen the devil is not in you he's here to criticize if the devil is nothing here he's there to find fault if the devil is is Antonio you're there to put this one down and put yourself up a man oh brother but again if it's Christ in you you're there to put yourself down and put the other one a man then the problem of God is as highlighted those things a man and he said with what he said white why does God do this why does God do that in his ministry in the first poll in the second poll because he said when they come before me so I get in their shoes a man get in their shows to know to understand them he said because why he said it could me my brother could be my sister could be my mother could be my father a man a man so brother if there's anything that God is reflecting in your life and mind it is Grace amen is that in the world is going to recognize in your life it is Greece oh that one you got a right attitude you got a right spirit that's grace oh yeah they'll recognize that hey ray because you have been with Jesus and it's not you living as Jesus living in you everybody and they attitude Jesus manifested toward his disciples and the word this one and that one brother you're going to have it a man he laid down his life he paid for your sin he picked it up again and he give you shared his life with you a man let's have the right attitude and the right spirit praise the Lord and he said out of the abundance of the heart he's most bigoted and he said why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say a man is like I preached on bear with me as I keep you standing and I preached on what was it I said not going to hell because what you did what you didn't do because jesus said in as much you didn't do it to the least of these you didn't do it to me and he said go to hell oh yeah he said go to the lake of fire amen and they'll have their part in the lake that fire burns with fire and brimstone amen brother god help us so he said why call me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say whosoever coming to me and here with my sayings and doing them I will show you - he is like he is like a man which build a house and dig deep probably God said he might have my bed and one of the messages I have here he said we got to dig deeper hey man and he shouldn't dig deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock and brother oh my grace that were on a rock because there's many houses gonna fall many ourselves already falling around the message and many are going to fall hey man so I said Jesus said to be no flesh saying amen how serious it is brother oh my how insane is the world it's insane I trust you see it when you go there in the world and you go there and you go there yeah oh my oh my oh mom we saw it again maybe than the last couple of days there and we saw the way they were dressing the way they were acting what they were thinking on why would they were doing this how they were doing this is it's it's insane I I saw this and I saw a mice myself sister Betty there and I said Lord no I said that's exactly I said the fulfillment of the prophecy that the prophet of God mentioned in this hour that the world will go insane and it is insane amen they don't just normal no more and even even when they used to said when they used to wear slacks one time there were bit loose you know I under legs and in their bodies and not only that but they didn't wear much in Indian realm of jeans another guy seen the old world even older women wearing jeans skin tight jeans and only that brother if my if my mother saw she have him into garbage she would why because they're all tore open here and tore open there tore open down there and almost all old holes in them and I remember my mother brother sister when we had jeez back years ago and she be seeing those things oh she dad they wouldn't let you wear no no she wouldn't you wear big eyes she had to gonna fix it a man half turn after a while they get so many holes here and she couldn't fix this you throw them to garbage and I've got a new pair but no they don't want that now knowing that but they're going to do gonna sell them like that and people are going to buy them like that yet that's insanity that does just some it doesn't make sense anymore and again they're closing for clothing that and a lot of it is the women and at the profit of gossiped is a woman's world and then there's so skin-tight this is absolutely amazing so where is the normal mind it's not there it's insane so I pray the grace of God Erebus lord help us or they were not going to let those spirits come on us they're not gonna let the old spirits influence us but what we do and how we do it what we're going to put on and when it comes to clothes brother let the Holy Ghost control us amen so proving that our house is built upon a rock a man and we're not going to stumble and fall into the foolishness of this world take your stand you go take your saying I don't care who it is even into his family or friends take your stand a man as way we have said too even to our daughter so you can't come into our house you've been raised this way you've been trained as well you know what is right and I said you can't you can't come in with a dress like that you can't come in and and we're in this stuff and all of that not know not buy anymore take your spirit and it's not you the Leafs this Christ is living in you Jesus took his name brother I wonder something how many got Jesus in them hey are you taking the same stand that Jesus took not me god help us brother amen so let's make sure make our call here actually sure make sure your house is built upon the rock of reveal word Christ and it says but he that heareth and doeth not still going to hell because what you didn't do he that hairier than do it not he's like a man he said that without a foundation building house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the rune of that house was great god bless his words or maybe seen it turn with me to Luke chapter 13 Luke chapter 13 and verse 27 and the Lord willing we after we get into these scriptures that the Lord wouldn't want I want to get into some of the quotes right here trying to bring this the sauce to a conclusion and move on to another thought concerning trying to do God a service without it being God's will aim at all but I'm believing the message but again the Provost said the message but he said you're in the message but the message is not in you a man her brother ran was experiencing that even even in the among believers if when met he might have been ministering in branham's having a call he might have been ministering in Shreveport Louisiana and again there's true to us to many that were non-denominational believers but again he knew a man they they were in the message or they were in the word but the word wasn't in them a man because if you're in the message the message controls you and if you're in the word the word controls you it's not you controlling the word it's not you bearing witness of the word by your mouth it's brothers you reflecting the word by your life a man and the greatest testimony you can give is not what you say it's what you do Amen praise the name of the Lord and God is looking at what you do God is looking at what you're doing God is looking at your actions God is looking at your reactions Amen because it'll bear witness of the anointing that you have in your life bear witness of the anointing that you have in your soul in your spirit and brother they have God in looking for looking for anything he's doing for the anointing in your soul he's looking for the anointing your your spirit a man by the grace of God on the inside of the inside again this is where father God warned us they said you can have the anointing in your flesh you can experience God in this God in that physically base if you don't have it in your heart and in your soul he said you're lost a man because God brother ain't man and doing what he did what was he doing he was providing you with the anointing and the eternal life that he was going to come into your soul amen he said repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall

third pole of our ministry what are what life a lot kind of a life were gonna leave totally separated a man named Andrew there's place well Oh Lord how much longer will I be with him brother if you got the Holy Ghost you're gonna have that revelation you're going to have that feeling Lord I'm not stalking are we gonna be here Lord we can't Lord if you let it go on and on and on and on there's nothing nobody saved that scripture he said if he didn't shorten time to be no place say Amen pray God by grace that was going on in that insane world is not influencing you but it was going on out there in that insane well not just politically but really religiously and spiritually and because the devil is the god of this world and he's there to see this generation as he deceived all generations then I see this generations he deceived Eve in the garden as he did see they clean outside the garden as he did see the others down through amen brother brother he deceived the third churches to the search agents amen oh yeah brothers in that same devil he's in control I tell you this he got so much control the church that Jesus is on the outside knocking a man why they got they crucified him oh yeah they crucified and they kicked him out didn't they didn't want they didn't want Jesus didn't mind the revelation of the word for the day and the hour that they were living amen they were satisfied with who they're satisfied with Wesley satisfied with the Pentecostal now instead of just taking it and going on going on looking for something greater look for something greater amen a greater manifestation of God amen brother way what are we looking for any out when when all this started 2,000 years ago what were they looking for resurrection and rapture hey man brother that's what that's why Jesus were pointing them to a man then of course hallelujah and what and what we were to experience physically they experienced spiritually amen they were resurrected you were you that were dead in sins and trespasses as he quickened as he made alive as I said I preached that in the church and I said I monitored you know I'm resurrected I want to let you know I'm raptured and they got right quiet oh it was a bit like I said two or three hundred people there I made three on the first or say in that church at the time and they all got very quiet and even the pastor was shocked and he just turned around and looked at him he didn't see it he didn't understand and I said I'm gonna give you the scripture I'm gonna give you the word yeah I should have proved to you that I said I have been resurrected I want to prove to you I said that I have been borned again rat raptured and oh they just couldn't see it and I said I wanted to give you the scripture anybody know what it is patience that's right sister a man and I said and you are the quicken resurrected yeah quicken made a lot because you were dead in sins and trespasses amen and it says you had the quicken you and he made alive you ready resurrected who were dead in sins and trespasses trespasses and sin but now you're not dead no more spiritually you're alive now amen you've been resurrected and he said he went on down and I said and he has raised us up ooh me and Jesus he has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus hey man so fiercely brother we are caught up and we're in another dimension spiritually brother we've been raptured amen were new creatures in Christ by the grace of God and Christ has come back knees in me a man what for looking for the redemption the resurrection physically and the resurrection and the rapture physically amen amen that what he accomplished in himself now he's working it out Oh God elbows brother sister did not just wait for this and wait for that let's get into it let's get into the revelation of you just get into the into the reality of what God is doing in this hour and brother God is not getting us ready for the rapture God is reffering us he's not getting us ready for the resurrection he's resurrecting us physically because we've already experienced it Mac or spiritually how he's doing it physically by the grace of God and of course when I give them the scripture oh praise the Lord they started to praise God and rejoice amen they got the revelation amen that's right because now they were testifying they were resurrected they were raptured they were resurrected and spiritually caught up into every places amen in our Lord Jesus Christ god help us brother this is this is how serious God wants it to be I won't don't I'm much longer you want to stay in this world but I'll tell you this too many believers that are that are satisfied in this world they're content in this world oh yeah they're just living for this and living for that oh yeah there's gonna be a resurrection don't be a rat no no no no you are the resurrection you are the rapture and you and you'll come to the same attitude that Jesus came to Lord oh I gotta get out of here that's right you'll be burden as jesus was or u.s. burden to get out of here and the bride is gonna be burden to get out of here you're gonna see this brother see this sister and they're gonna have that attitude Oh to do what's wrong with them you know they need an experience where they got one but the thing of it is when we think that about him we need an experience amen that's right people are too content with this world until finally Jesus said I am no more in the world he got he came to that that faith he came to that revelation no more in the world he was about to step out and step back amen how many among the believers today got that revelation I am no more in the world not me again my heart is burdened because too many too many believers are satisfied with this world too many believers are just going on and doing this and doing that but they're not homesick rather he went somewhere you got homesick oh my oh my oh my god help us brother that we're gonna get homesick for glory homesick preacher me I want to go home Lord I want to be with my father in heaven again I want to be with my brothers or sisters in glory again amen not natural brothers sister spiritual by the grace of God amen sons and daughters of God brother sister just like listen I don't know if you saw Saad I went on the internet there's a there's a news item there concerning a couple that that lived in central New Canada and twelve years ago they had a hunger and a thirst to move to Newfoundland what do Flanders want to get out of here they wanted to come back not come back because they're not Newfoundlanders and they wanted to come here yeah and they moved here now that the article who mentioned that the house that they bought wasn't exactly perfect and never never had everything done the way that a they may be that the house they were living in it was done No so they bought that house and they've been here for 12 years and they loved it amen how many of us got that desire to get out of here and into glory amen oh yeah how many of you are willing to leave the house you're in and go something less not many not many but brother I pray grace in the name of Jesus Lord not my will be done amen brother it is more serious and it is later than what many think it is I pray God I can be left behind I said Lawrence getting to that place now I said I trust I said we're not there yet and I trust we'll be gone in the rapture but I said I know there's a generation going to be wondering because we're all that you're seeing out there and it's gonna strike them too late and then they'll wonder where's the rapture it's already happened he didn't know it didn't know it God sent the Prophet to let us know amen to give us the word to give us the revelation amen to give us the teaching concerning the resurrection concerning the rapture a man there are many going to get caught up with this revival caught up with that revival that revival but not the right way babe no they're not going to get caught up with the revival that's going to change us from time to eternity amen where Jesus got caught up there was a revival of the Jesus head but the disciples didn't recognize it he went to sleep and they were dopey and dozy and so on amen he says rebar take your rest because he knew that there was a time coming when they needed they would go forward amen and they would do as he did lay down their lives they ever do is he did they would drink of his cup hey man that I turned not many one drink of his cup now no no they don't want that did we want the excitement we want this we want that no no brother get it in your soul not in your flesh amen because it's the end of your flesh it's the end of this body it's good it's going to be cast down amen glory hallelujah god help us to keep looking to that dimension for a glorified body amen that we're going to turn back young again and the young ones here I'm gonna get a little holder amen by the grace of God please in the name of Jesus look for the resurrection look for the rapture because he's of the resurrection be conscious of the rapture Jesus was conscious of what lay ahead him amen and that's what he was so serious in his attitude in his spirit they were everybody wondering what's going on with Jesus you know he's not like he used to be they're gonna wonder what's going on with the believers they're not like they used to be oh they used to be this they used to be that but now they're there right really the hours come for the fulfillment of what we've been preaching be still and know that I am God amen put your trust in the Lord no confidence in me Amen all but we put confidence in this brother this brother this one this sister this no no it's him thus saith the Lord we'll get we'll get some of those eventually concerning the rapture concerning the bride amen thank you as I said I I there's certain things have been preached that I got it correct and concerning the concerning revival people are gonna get deceived oh yeah maybe so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible I pray God that is not going to deceive us it'll prove that we're elect a man that were the very elect by the grace of God ordained to the resurrection ordained for the rapture now what brother if God's waiting enough that means that we got to say what Jesus said amen when he challenged Martha I am the resurrection hey man and if he's the resurrection he's the rapture cuz he laid down his life he picked it up again amen and now brother the Saints have laid down their lives for so many years now there's a generation rising it's going to pick it up by the grace of God amen so brother it is more serious and it is really later than what many think please how much more do you want to see out there in the world Oh worse do you wanted to want to see it become what Jesus got to the place he didn't want to see anymore Tapani how long shall I be with you I'm no more in the world oh brother he went beyond that I'm no more in the world why yeah I know more in the world where are you he was closer to Eternity than he was to time a man going home going back where he come from brother but most are not recognizing the seriousness of the lateness of the hour because they're not hearing and seeing the way God wants them to hear it and see it and that's true God happens you got to hear it and see it the way God wants you to hear it and see it again concerning what our brother Mark was ministering on brother if we hear it and see it the way God wants us to hear and see it then you know oh it's the in or Finney yeah cuz he went all the way up through the through the Word of God and the plan of God the planning were at being it's not the Alpha no more steel mega yeah so we got to believe I am the resurrection and the life amen brother if he was than we are because I turned it today in Jesus prophesied in the end is the oneness between him the father and the believer and he's any prayed father that you'll show them this you'll give them this so they'll know he said that I mean you you and me and I'm in there if the father's in the Sun and the Sun is in us whatever what are we our tears to many believers are there really they don't have that experience but if the father's in the Sun and the Sun is in you then brother you're going to have the attitude and the spirit and the revelation of the Sun I am the resurrection and life brother he didn't he didn't confess this during the first two poles of his ministry but in the third pole and brother he's not confessing it now in in the first two poles of the province ministry but in the third pole a me I am the resurrection and the light and brother if he got that revelation you got amen because brother we got to have it to get out of here the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them period yeah that's what it says Oh what about this what were they look God does what it what we need and it gives us the faith he's looking for that faith now a mayor is not God looking for this looking for this doctor and that doctor he's looking for the faith amen he's looking for the faith that the revealed Word was predestinated to give the endtime right a man a man and yet there are those that are rejoicing because God did this God did that yeah but God is looking for the results of it now amen God looking for the the end result because they comes by hearing and hearing by the word a man with little Luther's age Wesley sage the Pentecostal age now this age and what faith is it giving you if you ever really given your faith that pleases God then I'm no more in the world and you're gonna live like and the ambas the emphasis is going to be on the spiritual not the natural lord thank you for this thank you for that that's behind Lord amen whatever you want me to have do you can give it you know I'll help others it's like I said God can't guy can't trust everybody with with riches guy can't trust everybody with money why because they're not there to help us that's right and then buddy he bless his people with this bless his people with that why certain ones why because he knows they're here to help and they're gonna help this brother this history up this one help that one so on yeah but there's so many today they're not there to help they're looking for help they want more and they want more do this do this so on no you do it now okay so God brother go again to hear the way that God wants us to hear it and to see it the way that God wants us to see it and brother many are not hearing and seeing Malachi for the way that God wants us to hear see that's why they're going to miss the resurrection and they're going to miss the rapture and they'll be here for the tribulation the Great Tribulation amen because they are not governed by a right motive and a right objective but if you're truly born again you'll be governed by the right motive and the right objective and without the right anointing will be religious but not spiritual emotional in our flesh but not in our spirits not in our souls grace brother what is it Manny and amid vast majority of believers today are doing God a service but not according to his will amen brother got brother Brown makes certain statements in the message invisible Union brother it wasn't November the 25th 65 that he preached invisible Union in Shreveport November 27th 65 he preached doing God a service without his will in Shreveport and brother he said a lot more in Shreveport than he said when he when he preached it in Jeffersonville in July 65 oh yeah there's a lot more that's why when I was looking I like I said I was looking for certain quotes and I said oh it's doing God a server that his will I got the Jeffersonville one but it wasn't there I found it in Shreveport oh yeah there's very strong in what it what he was saying and brother they were believers there even from Jeffersonville in Shreveport at the time he wasn't just preaching to Shreveport believers be is preaching to his own believers brother it's amazing as I said that those that believe brother Brown was a prophet and yet when he preached church order many of them got up and left his church that's right and went to another church god help us as I said we have preached and preached and preached dear and well-liked one brother said when brother Gerald is finished the seats are full of blood and so on I pray grace for that brother amen they got to bring him back into the spoke and we've had a number of people get up and leave and leave the church because there's one sister said oh my she's her brother she said because of your preaching he said she said when we lead the service she said we just drive around I got to drive around and drive around and drive around she said tell tell her her husband calm down cuz he didn't like the preaching now of course not long after they left the church yeah and he moved on somewhere else and we had another couple there and they left and moved on somewhere else and there was a there was another third couple I understand they moved on to another Church yeah as I say where they go they want to go to big churches where they can hide among the trees of the garden do what they want do us right in their own eyes yeah but oh yeah and I don't doubt there's there's number of people that left bound Tabernacle yes brother Brown was preaching to her to her yeah but he knew he had to do it let me share with you well few quotes from the message doing God a surgery at his real in Shreveport we'll get more eventually listen he said no matter who we think is right God knows who's best qualified because he knows the heart of man and God's looking at your heart even now when you're receiving the word God's not looking at your face or your flesh or your mind gospel guide your heart what is your attitude toward the word in your heart that's what he sees nor does the revival nor does these things happen at the time we think they ought to happen he said it's this time right now he's a glory to God he said I noticed in our chapters and so forth of the businessman he said there's coming right away this is what they're saying he said there's coming right away Alleluia a great revival he said don't be deceived he has already come and they didn't and they did to him what was listed but he said they think there's a revival it's happening he said no he said it's done it's dead it's over he said notice he said this is lamp trimming time he said this is coming out and going in and they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength his lamp trimming time but people are still looking for emotional revival not a spiritual revival and he said now notice here in our text he said David the king of Israel he was the one who got the revelation of bringing the Ark of God back to his place and they never consulted it in the days of Saul because Saul was back slid so they never consulted the Ark at all the Covenant in the days of Saul because he Bachelet and he got away from God and so he said David quickly under inspiration but notice he said it's very treacherous text if you don't get it right brother the revealed word is very treacherous if you don't get it right is there to save you or is there to judge you it'll put you in or to put you out amen now one of the prophets Edwin he said the pulpit he's in the ministry over the pulpit he's judging the people it's the word judging the people oh yeah definitely God knows your heart he said God knows your spirit and so on your action your reaction God and he said what's he what and not only that he said when you're preaching the word what are we doing he said we're casting out spirits casting out evil spirits a lot of cast o spirits out of you're out of your mind praying God they're not in your soul we have the chasm out of your soul oh yeah through the preaching of the word oh my brother amen so there's an anointing there's not a brother with with intellectual night and the boys just make and it's all natural natural no no it is brother there's something going on in another dimension a man there are spirits here in another dimension and the father gods and he said the devil is there too he said he was the first one in church yeah and the devil is here and brother Tony he's trying to influence your thoughts your mind your spirit oh yeah but he said thank God God is here and he and what to influence us through the word and the breaks are the word and the judge through the word and to cast out evil spirits that may trying to influence your thinking a man and he'll try to add to what was being preached you try to take away from what's being preached amen that's right yes the devil so let's make sure your honor the anointing of the Holy Ghost not the devil a man he said notice it's a very treacherous text if you don't get it right and I feel that the hour is coming where we should be man is to the babies amen exactly but there's lot spiritual babies oh yeah babies they want to be baby no no sorry we're not gonna baby you rolling with the word we're going to correct you sometimes with the word guys gonna whip you oh yes amen and he said we should have strong meat instead of milk amen and he's David king of Israel the king had just been freshly anointed the King and he said insane you annoyed him by the will of God and he was absolutely God's chosen king he said no doubt about it and he said listen God has his way of set way of doing things yeah let's do it God's Way hey man oh yeah The ministers get up preach God's Way you got to come here in God's Way our brother Bob is gonna get up and be anointed to lead a song service God's Way hey man but when I like our brother Joshua prayed or any of their brothers knew you ask up to pray they're gonna do it God's Way it's gonna be God in control a man God praying God interceding a man praise the name of the Lord go for it preach the word do it God's Way amen he said God as his own way of doing things and he said sending revivals talking speaking whatever it is he has the way of doing it and we are nobody to tell him how to do it and he see doesn't the way it pleases him and his remember the Holy Spirit can come and anoint a person and still it's out of the will of God you can be anointed with the Holy Ghost in your flesh and in your human spirit but it's not out of your soul you got it from the outside a man when you can be still out of the will of God that's right and he said we have to go through God's will and God's Way of doing it not our ways God's Way of doing it and he said David been anointed he said with the Spirit of God upon him a type of Jesus Christ but that wasn't God's channel a man he didn't consult the Prophet now he said what's closed it gets to that razor-sharp edge between right and wrong between those who are going to make it and those who don't make it it's a razor sharp edge it's a halation that many don't have today because they got their what he called the electric shavers you know but back there they had they had the old-fashioned shavers that you would shave and the blades that would go into them it's a razor-sharp edge if you got one somewhere in your home go get a blade Lord which side am I on that's how that's how that's how serious it is he said it would deceive the very elect if possible amen so he said it's a razor-sharp age now between right and wrong serious that well who's right here and who's wrong if it's a razor sharp edge which which side am I on or I'm on the right wrong side or wrong oh I believe 99.99999% the message yeah so does the devil know he believes it all but he's there to take away point zero zero zero zero zero one oh yeah had this and had that take this away take that away that's why he said it'd be so close it would deceive the very elect impossible let's make our calling and our election sure he said it's razor sharp edge - he said til it comes down sometime like a honed razor in the difference of right and wrong it's got to be of every word of God not just almost every word but every word marilla you know we got to be exactly here in the will of God according to the will of God what he's revealed in this hour and this age are we in the truth are we in the message are we in the revelation of the the mystery of the seven seals are we really in it because I tell you the end result of it all is the resurrection and the rapture is not just knowledge intellectual knowledge of this this and this no no it's the revelation it's resurrection you know I am the resurrection I'm the rapture and he said it's God today not to Lutheran's not to Methodists not to Pentecostals but to that honed age in this age where the Antichrist anointing is so perfectly it would deceive the very elect just think the Antichrist of 19 when we're in a supermarket there was one person in front of us and he paid for what he had bought well the cashier was the testimony was yeah because What did he say oh he said look this is your total is six six six oh and he sort of hinted to the man that he was going to be cursed or suffer something nice and Laura I said blessed that young man I said with a greater revelation yeah he said your your your total is six six six six dollars and sixty six cents but yet somewhere he must have known what it meant it represented so we went through I should see if you can get 777 for us okay he said but I sensed too that he had revelation so I pray God bless you amen he was a witness to that customer yeah I pray it'll cause the customer to think hey man maybe that's why God allowed him to say it praise the name of the Lord your brother sister don't let the world condemn us don't let God condemn us a man let's be in the word let's make sure you got 777 out 666 our brother you're the valve has used him numbers 666 but he's careful the way he says it a man so brother the prophet of God said to that old age in this age where the Antichrist Antonius so perfectly it would deceive the very elect 'add and they'll fall on the wrong side if they don't watch it like a wedge and he said watch be careful he said we're not living in a Pentecostal age now we're past that age and he said just the same as it passed Luther and it passed the others so we are not in the Pentecostal age no no we're in the bright age and most don't recognize that no they think it were Jude well the proper God said this is the climax of the Pentecostal age yeah but the climax is the bright age because remember that the Pentecostal age when the angel when the angel came into into brendham tabernacle when the prophet of God was preaching those those series that series and he was preaching the loud of C&H and the angel came in and there was a number of people that were sitting in the audience and they saw and they saw the pillar fire came in and what did he do he went over and he drew it on the wall yeah and but the probably God said no he said when the when the angel in the pillar fire put it on the wall he said this was total darkness and he said I put that there he said to represent the elect and really really to represent the bright age amen oh yeah so the ain't when the angel did it it was all dirt why cuz Christ was on the outside Nachman a man and he and he told him if you think you're rich increase were good for that meat of nothing but he but he said you're wretched poor miserable blind and naked and don't know it if one thing to be that there's another thing not to know it oh yeah he says you're this and you don't know it you think you're this you think you're that no no he said I stand at the door knock and if any man hear my voice all come in and sup with him and he with me not the church the praise the Lord sir brother misunderstand there's nothing over there wearing that light there yeah we're not in that age we're in the right age amen the messenger knocking calling us to the revealed word and he said notice now David thought he had everything in order and he was inspired and he said Co the hook Co the holy spirit ISA can anoint a man but he says got to be in the order of the anointing and he said the outside spirit can anoint with the Holy Ghost and he said the soul as a dark as dark as pitch you can be anointed on your flesh and in your soul you can be as dark as pitch what we need is to make sure the anointing is in our soul not in our flesh that I've been born again amen many are born into a church but they're not born into the kingdom of God a man god help his brother he said the true God is there in a direct it into the word not just one place in the word but the entire word for the entire age thank God for the entire word for this age a man there with me my brethren don't you miss this and he said my sisters you want to be women preachers and so forth don't you miss this no matter how much your anointing is you've got to get in God's provided position a man and he said Davis and Ani was alright but in doing it he got enthused and he stepped over the boundary line and what did he do he stepped over the boundary line instead of putting the ark in its right original position he said he carried it on a new cart and not over the hearts of the Levites it was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the Levites which is over the heart and he said the word is not in the mind it's in the heart amen make sure you got the message in your heart in your soul on the inside the inside not in your flesh not in your mind amen Grace and he said no matter how sincere a man may be no matter how great he's used of God no matter what he is he must be this and he sure the thing that he is speaking of must be timely by the Bible somebody say well Moses back there I know what Moses did but that's not what God's doing today he said well way back yonder thirty years ago Luther that man that might be fine but that's not what he's doing today 40 years ago Pentecost that's not what he's doing today it must be timely what's he doing now he's giving us to through the mystery of God he's giving us the resurrection of the rapture hey hey hey comes by hearing hearing by the word so by the word we're getting resurrection rapture in pain and he did mention about the opening of the seven seals he said his rapturing fate give us rapturing pay why to let us know it's to him and the next thing is the rapture the resurrection a man there was Luther the next scene with Westley the next thing was the Pentecostal but now what's next it's the resurrection the rapture he said you say glory to God the Holy Ghost fell on me hallelujah just like it did under day of Pentecost but that might be different today it fell on David too and he should have fell on your Ziya but it was wrong and you've got to go deeper than that you got to go deeper than that now don't feel hurt just be reverent a man he said it must come to a man of God's choosing not a denominational choosing none of the peoples choosing but according to God's choosing and he should have it's a message from God or a great revelation from God it must come to his prophet and he said there's five things it must be number one he said it must be in season number two it must be the time God said it would be it must be written in the Word of God it must be in season of God's time by God's choosing by the grace of God amen he's warning he said this is the kind of meeting we must sit in in the future what kind of meeting was it this is like a funeral service no people don't want that no no - Leslie Singh they wanted the funeral service but you got a it gotta be a funeral service well for its the dead and dying world this is the kind of meeting we must set into the future and he was he was leading them in a in a hymn hole to God's unchanging hand bill your hopes on things eternal not natural hold to God's unchanging hand and he said when our journey is completed after God we have been true fair and bright our home and glory our enraptured social view and then he said this is the kind of meeting we must sit in the future because the people were humbled they were sincere they were repenting they were crying lord have mercy yeah and he said I we thank your Lord as we sit in this solemn moment almost like a funeral for we're facing the burial of a dying dead world we're facing the burial of a dying dead Church Oh God gather your wheat quickly father come quickly Lord Jesus and he said bless thy people father bring sincerity and deepness to the hearts of the people and may we get off of these fragile bubble dances Joseph was not here I said this years and years ago years ago brother Joseph was just a young boy but he went home and told his mother what to brother Jura said because he thought - something wrong he said brother Gerald mention Bubble dances yeah even remember that that struck him well it'll strike him again a man god bless him so he said bless thy people father beans bring sincerity and deepness to the hearts of the people yeah sincerity and deepness maybe we get off of those fragile bubble dances settle down into the deep riches of the honey of God a may Granite Lord keep our hearts established with love and sincerity a man and a men doing God a service without his will but let's make sure we're in the will of God what is the will of God we're we're in the message but make sure the message is in you and if the message is in you it'll reveal the will of God to you and the will of God is resurrection and rapturing pain it's just not coming out it's going it wasn't hard to get us out but it was hard to get it's hard to get us here I think brother Mark was touched on something on Wednesday but this thought came to me and I said yeah there's no trouble to get him out there signs there wonders and and in Egypt they did this they did this oh yeah amazing and they saw miracles done spoken word miracles this miracle that miracle and so on and they went and they sacrificed the Lambs but blood on the on the poster of their the gates going into the house and the blood on the house and so on the doors around the doors and the Death Angel came and went all through the land of Egypt smote the firstborn of the Egyptians and so on but then came the hour of deliverance and they came out and brother oh yeah and he gypsies were behind them and there was the Red Sea in front of them oh yeah and still they doubt it not all but some doubted and so on and but but God had the pillar fire between between the Jews and the Egyptians a man so that a man but give late to the to the Jews but it blinded the Egyptians because they couldn't see because of the pillar fire and the light and Soma and then God went through the serve of the Prophet and there was the Red Sea he said speak the word and what'd he do he opened up the Red Sea and they went on he went on through on dry land a man and of course the Egyptians followed him but then the the sea closed in and and they were drowned what generation are we oh yeah just they'd they tried to follow because a lot did it again that's why the prophet of God said there's make their believers make believers non-believers trust where believers not to make believer not nominally yeah but then when they came to the promised land Joshua Caleb couldn't wait to get in or they want to go but did the others no they refused the challenge of the of the promise God said every every place too full of the soldier put your trade so I'll give it to you but they didn't want to do it they wanted God to do in the promised land what he did in Egypt signs and wonders no but Joshua Keadle added the anointing of a revival that would take them in yeah but just think the revival wasn't God doing this God doing that the revival was God in Joshua Caleb possessing delay amen the revivalist Christ in the bride entering into the resurrection rapture where he's the Lord are we in the bride revival god help us brother let's just let's see it the way God wants us to see it do it the way God wants us to do it with the right motive right objective the right attitude by the grace of God he said the word and the word was in the beginning we'll go back to the beginning which is God and that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father and me I in you and you and me hallelujah he said we're here hallelujah I'm so glad to see him purse personifying himself right among us and has seen what he promised for the word not what somebody's emotions singing jumping dancing but by his word he's making himself known a man and the word he said the evening message must carry evening results and the evening message must sow evening seeds not morning seeds evening seeds and the evening time message was show evening time light and will show evening time results in the beginning and the beginning message showed the beginning results he made creation he made his son in his image and then in the midday in the evening time he made a bride for it he said what by he did it by his word how did he form the earth by his word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us how will he take his bride by the word not by a new cart not by some theologians idea but he'll take the bride according to his word you'll identify her don't put one thing to it don't take one thing from it leave it the way that it is the evening time he promised he'd revealed he opened the seven seals and show what them churches had missed back there revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 17 and 30 and he said he would do it so it's not mixed up let's keep it right like that the way that it is amen I'd like to bring it to a close and this is doing God a service in Jeffersonville he said live humble live loving loved one another don't never get nothing among you if you see something coming up in your heart against somebody you say get it out of there right then and Satan will do his best to get among you don't you let that happen see brother sister we got to understand we still have were still dealing with the devil while we're in these flesh we'll deal with the devil amen Jesus dealt with him right to the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus dealt with him right on through to the cross amen he's a Satan will do his best to get among you yeah you'll be there don't you let that happen some slick tongue fellow might come along and try to take you away from it and you think they took her talking Moses out of the presence of God where he stood no sir no we don't take from it we don't add to it just keep it the way the Lord said it we don't want no denomination we don't want no organization we don't want no malice we don't want no strife we want God he is the word amen he said Lord may our hearts can't be continually be set on thee and we know Lord that money property things of the world have no meanings I trust it doesn't and he said it is all temporal all of them must go our jobs our places our friends everything must go no matter how rich or poor how popular or unpopular that we are all must go but there's only one thing that our being ears can't send it around and that's Jesus Christ God help us God he said let us lay aside everything that secondarily and hold to him e is the word the vindicated word of the hour a man and a man anding God is calling for and looking for it is total separation from unwilling by the grace of God have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness the challenge to us okay this is the challenge have you forgotten about your dinner have you

wanted to get go home for dinner or go home for supper the natural was taking control of the spiritual oh I'm worrying about the children no no he said have you forgotten all about the past and realize what that is your feeling right now is materializing before you he said day by day he said let that be the center he said let the rest of the things go away they're going to perish anyhow and
