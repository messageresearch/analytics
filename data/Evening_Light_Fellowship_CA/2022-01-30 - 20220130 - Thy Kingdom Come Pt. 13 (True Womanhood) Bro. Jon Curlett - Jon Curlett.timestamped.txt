[31:26] hopefully that'll be over soon so let's

[34:51] authority lord of your goodness and
[34:53] grace heavenly father
[34:55] lord your word says that in a time of
[34:57] trouble you'd hide us in a pavilion

[35:08] lord as lord things get frustrating and
[35:11] difficult and hard and lord our patience
[35:13] wears thin lord may we come back to that
[35:15] place of rest or may we just feed
[35:17] ourselves with the good things of god or
[35:20] may we shut aside everything that would
[35:21] come against us we pray heavenly father

[35:42] and amen amen thank you brother paul i
[35:44] appreciate that
[35:46] amen turn in the scriptures if you would
[35:48] to colossians 1
[35:50] colossians 1.
[35:52] god bless you welcome each one back
[35:54] it's good to see some different faces
[35:55] that haven't been here a while brother
[35:57] chad sister lily sister rebecca and then
[35:59] brother josh back and
[36:01] amends good to
[36:03] good to have each one of you here this
[36:04] morning amen colossians chapter 1 and
[36:06] verse 12
[36:07] it says giving thanks unto the father
[36:09] which had made us meet to be partakers
[36:12] of the inheritance of the saints in
[36:13] light who had delivered us from the
[36:15] power of darkness and had translated us
[36:18] into the kingdom of his dear son
[36:20] in whom we have redemption through his
[36:22] blood even the forgiveness of sins
[36:24] who is the image of the invisible god
[36:27] the firstborn of every creature that is
[36:29] god's first purpose revealed right there
[36:32] verse 16 says
[36:34] for by him were all things created that
[36:36] are in heaven and that are in earth
[36:38] visible and invisible whether they be
[36:39] thrones or dominions or principalities
[36:42] or powers all things were created by him
[36:44] and for him and he is before all things
[36:47] and by him all things consist
[36:49] and he is the head of the body the
[36:51] church who is the beginning the
[36:53] firstborn from the dead that in all
[36:55] things he might have the preeminence
[36:57] that's god's second purpose
[36:59] for it please the father that in him
[37:01] should all fullness dwell and having
[37:03] made peace through the blood of his
[37:04] cross by him to reconcile all things
[37:06] unto himself by him i say whether they
[37:09] be things in earth or things in heaven
[37:11] that you who were sometimes alienated
[37:14] and enemies in your mind by wicked works
[37:16] yet now had he reconciled in the body of
[37:19] his flesh through death to present you
[37:21] holy and unblameable and unreprovable in
[37:24] his sight
[37:26] if ye continue in the faith grounded and
[37:28] settled and be not moved away from the
[37:30] hope of the gospel which you have heard
[37:33] and which was preached to every creature
[37:35] which is under heaven
[37:36] whereof i paul and made a minister
[37:38] that's god's third purpose is brother
[37:40] branham todd amen you can have your
[37:41] seats this morning god add his blessing
[37:43] to the reign of his word
[37:45] and i want to continue on our series on
[37:47] thy kingdom come but i want to take a
[37:50] different path this morning and we're
[37:51] certainly going to be teaching this
[37:52] morning not preaching by god's grace and
[37:55] we know that teaching positionally
[37:56] places us brother branham said so this
[37:58] is where we get down and again it's a
[38:00] rubber meets the road type of of service
[38:02] i think and but we focused a lot on
[38:04] attitude and spirit in the last few
[38:06] services and not just of course our
[38:07] sisters but to all of us as believers as
[38:09] parts of the body but today we want to
[38:12] move past that idea of the attitude the
[38:14] attitude is critical and if you have the
[38:15] wrong attitude brother braham says god
[38:17] can't do anything with you you can be
[38:18] wrong but have the right attitude and
[38:20] god has something to work with but if
[38:22] you've got the wrong attitude but you
[38:24] think you're right in your doctrine god
[38:25] can't work with you because you're
[38:26] unteachable amen but this morning as i
[38:29] said we're going to be focusing again on
[38:30] the sisters and i want to take a title
[38:32] of true womanhood now when we start
[38:34] talking about womanhood and true by true
[38:37] i mean scriptural word-based womanhood
[38:39] amen so this is what the word says about
[38:42] our sisters this is not about what i
[38:44] think or what other people think we're
[38:45] going to be sticking purely to the
[38:46] scriptures and the quotes on these
[38:48] things
[38:49] but the even the idea of womanhood
[38:50] because what we have today is a is a
[38:52] mentality that women can do anything
[38:54] and quite frankly women can do almost
[38:56] anything they can't father a child but
[38:58] aside from that physically there's just
[38:59] about nothing that they can't do but
[39:02] when we talk about womanhood womanhood
[39:04] is the essence or true state or
[39:07] condition of being a woman it's what
[39:08] makes a woman a woman and not a man and
[39:11] that's what we want to focus on this
[39:12] morning amen is what it means to truly
[39:14] be a scriptural woman to be a word-based
[39:17] woman to be stepping into that role and
[39:19] then god has a vision god has a plan god
[39:21] has a purpose for all of us and he has
[39:23] entrusted women with virtues with
[39:25] responsibilities with roles that only
[39:27] they are supposed to do and in some
[39:29] cases only they can do properly amen and
[39:32] god god has set it up so that no man can
[39:34] take a woman's place and then just as no
[39:36] woman can take a man's place when he's
[39:38] in his position nor can he take her out
[39:41] of her take her position when she's
[39:43] properly in it as well amen and brother
[39:45] brown gets into it there are aspects of
[39:46] life that are solely meant for women and
[39:48] that is what makes them women scriptural
[39:50] women it's what brings them into a place
[39:52] of true womanhood and if she can stay in
[39:54] that place that god has ordained her
[39:56] then she will be blessed beyond belief
[39:58] amen same as a man would
[39:59] now
[40:01] i want to start with a couple quotes
[40:02] that brother branham has here and he
[40:04] says i think a woman is a wonderful
[40:06] thing and a mother especially
[40:08] but they should be in their places and
[40:10] not take the place of a man and not take
[40:12] the place of god so he says it's amazing
[40:14] place to be as long as you're in your
[40:16] place
[40:17] the next one he says the i have the
[40:18] highest and deepest the deepest and
[40:21] highest respects for women my mother is
[40:23] one and my wife and i have young
[40:24] daughters and a woman that keeps her
[40:26] place and is a lady there is nothing any
[40:30] more precious outside of salvation to
[40:32] our nation than a real woman he didn't
[40:35] say than a real man he said than a real
[40:37] woman that's a very special place to be
[40:39] that's an elevated place to be that
[40:41] shows the type of importance it has
[40:43] for our le our sisters and our women in
[40:45] the church to stay in the place that god
[40:48] has called them to be
[40:49] he says i think a woman that's genuine
[40:51] is a jewel
[40:53] praise god for a real woman you're god's
[40:56] hands made but a real woman is like a
[40:58] real man they'll follow the word of god
[41:00] regardless of what the devil says or any
[41:03] false thing he's pointing back to eve
[41:04] when she got out of that place then
[41:06] we've got a problem amen but it shows
[41:08] here the elevated position of women when
[41:11] they are in their god-given place when
[41:12] they step into the role that god has
[41:14] called them to be then it's a blessed
[41:16] place and he even goes as far as to say
[41:18] that they're a real jewel he calls them
[41:20] the fifth gospel and we'll get in later
[41:21] he even says they're the backbone of a
[41:23] nation
[41:24] is real womanhood amen
[41:27] now we've talked about before how when
[41:29] we were in the old testament the role of
[41:31] a woman was primarily to have children
[41:33] and that was the only role and we'll see
[41:35] as we go through the scriptures that it
[41:36] does focus primarily on women in a
[41:38] family role or in a relationship role
[41:40] because that is the perfect type of
[41:42] christ in the bride amen so what we go
[41:44] through here when we focus on womanhood
[41:46] that womanhood is going to circle around
[41:48] the family
[41:49] that's the way it is because and we'll
[41:50] see why that is as we get there but
[41:52] again we don't want to exclude those
[41:54] that are single whether single by
[41:57] calling or single just by by
[41:58] circumstance for now but we find that
[42:00] there's a place where we have
[42:03] we actually have three roles in the
[42:04] scripture and we have we have men
[42:10] and we have women
[42:13] and their roles are distinct and
[42:15] separate now there can absolutely be
[42:17] crossover where a man can help a man can
[42:19] help a woman and a woman can help a man
[42:20] in their role especially in a marriage
[42:22] in these things but we also have a third
[42:23] right here
[42:25] and it's what the scripture calls a
[42:27] eunuch
[42:29] and so they are not defined in what they
[42:31] do in life by a man or a woman but they
[42:32] are actually a type of the angels in
[42:34] heaven where they have no
[42:36] they're not it's not that they're
[42:37] genderless it's that they are not giving
[42:39] life they're not giving something to
[42:40] themselves but rather they're giving
[42:41] their life completely to service and
[42:43] this is where our single brothers and
[42:45] sisters will fit in and that's a calling
[42:47] that is not a choice that's a calling
[42:49] that god puts in their life when paul
[42:50] talks about it and jesus talks about it
[42:52] so you have most of us are called to be
[42:54] men and women in the gender roles and
[42:56] and with a family and whatnot but we
[42:58] have a special group of people that are
[43:00] called to be eunuchs paul talks about it
[43:02] and jesus talks about and he says if you
[43:03] can handle it this is the place that you
[43:05] want to be for the kingdom safe because
[43:07] we remember when we started in the old
[43:09] testament it was be fruitful and
[43:11] multiply and then once we got into the
[43:13] new testament it switched to what go ye
[43:16] into the out into the all the world and
[43:18] preach the gospel it was about spiritual
[43:20] lives now it's not about natural lives
[43:22] so there's a special place for people
[43:24] that are focused solely and purely not
[43:26] just on bringing natural life into the
[43:27] world but bringing spiritual life in the
[43:29] world and those are eunuchs unto god is
[43:31] is the way it's defined amen
[43:34] so there is a place for being single and
[43:36] there's a place for being married and
[43:37] being in relationships and these things
[43:39] but the primary role in the primary
[43:41] description is always given to men and
[43:43] women in relationship and typically in
[43:45] marriage of course because that's the
[43:47] perfect type of christ in the bride god
[43:49] wanted a family god didn't want eunuchs
[43:50] he wanted a family he had all the
[43:52] eunuchs he had all the angels they were
[43:54] not reproductive or anything like that
[43:56] he had those but he wanted something
[43:57] else so we see that true manhood and
[43:59] true womanhood are reflected in a
[44:01] relationship not in being single but
[44:03] there is a place for being single and
[44:05] it's a special place as well amen now
[44:07] i'm going to take us back to the message
[44:08] crisis and mystery of god reveal because
[44:10] it holds the key to all of this when we
[44:12] start to look at these things but i'm
[44:14] going to move quickly because i've
[44:15] covered it before so i just want to set
[44:17] a bit of a foundation this morning and
[44:19] then we'll we'll start to move into this
[44:21] this thought on true womanhood now
[44:23] brother branham talks about the
[44:24] threefold purpose of god in christ is
[44:26] the mystery of god revealed he says
[44:28] sorry let me come back to this quickly
[44:30] he says god has chosen an elected lady
[44:32] which is his bride she's elected i hope
[44:35] we're members of that tonight across the
[44:37] world the illustration here showing the
[44:39] relationship of bride to christ the
[44:41] elect lady and how she was to be brought
[44:43] to him where she would come from and how
[44:45] she would be brought to him the church
[44:47] here an illustration that we got in view
[44:49] is illustrated by a woman which a woman
[44:52] is always a type of the church because
[44:54] the church is considered a bride a bride
[44:56] she is the bride of the lord jesus the
[44:58] son of god always if you'll watch watch
[45:01] the conditions and the conduct of women
[45:02] and you'll see where the church is we've
[45:04] read this before he says now some of
[45:06] these remarks may seem strange to some
[45:08] of you but it's complementary to the
[45:09] message that i have from the lord that
[45:11] i'm trying to get to the people see you
[45:13] watch everything in the natural how it's
[45:15] happening nature and watch it it runs
[45:17] sure with the spiritual also now if
[45:19] you'll see the conduct of the woman in
[45:21] the world today watch the conduct of the
[45:23] worldly church today just watch of
[45:25] course now there's also the conduct of
[45:27] the spiritual bride the church see watch
[45:30] that also so what we wanted to point out
[45:32] there is that he's saying that christ
[45:34] you have a christ type and then you have
[45:36] a bride type and that's why when we talk
[45:38] about womanhood it's always reflected in
[45:40] a bride type not in a single woman type
[45:42] amen the woman is typed as a bride of
[45:44] christ not a woman of christ she's not a
[45:46] widow she's not a single woman she's
[45:48] always typed as a bride and that's why
[45:50] true womanhood is found in that bride
[45:52] position amen that's what eve was to
[45:54] adam she was a part of him it was two
[45:56] parts of one whole if we look at that
[45:58] now we started out with that first
[46:00] scripture in in colossians and that's a
[46:02] bit of a weird scripture to start with
[46:04] to talk on true womanhood because it
[46:06] doesn't mention anything about womanhood
[46:07] in there but it's the type that brother
[46:09] branham brings out in the in the message
[46:11] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[46:13] where he shows the threefold purpose and
[46:15] if we can catch the threefold purpose of
[46:17] god then we know that as as christ as
[46:19] the bride or as the husband then the
[46:21] bride is going to be a part of the
[46:22] threefold purpose of god amen that she's
[46:25] going to have a role and a
[46:26] responsibility within that and we'll see
[46:28] that in the spiritual and then we'll see
[46:29] it in the natural for our sisters to see
[46:32] so he says here he says the first
[46:34] purpose of god as revealed in the
[46:35] scriptures to express himself completely
[46:38] god in christ so there's a revealing
[46:41] that happens first and then he says when
[46:43] i see god's great purpose revealing
[46:46] himself and having first to reveal
[46:47] himself in christ the fullness of the
[46:50] godhead bodily and then to bring that
[46:52] fullness of godhead bodily into a people
[46:56] that he could have the preeminences the
[46:58] oversight and the leading
[47:00] so there's an initial revealing of
[47:02] christ and then there's an ongoing
[47:04] revealing of himself not only to the
[47:06] people but in the people amen it's an
[47:08] ongoing event people today should be
[47:10] able to see christ as clearly as they
[47:12] did when he was here 2000 years ago
[47:14] because he's continuously revealing him
[47:16] to those that are his bride amen
[47:19] but after this they move on to the
[47:21] second purpose of god which is to have
[47:23] the preeminences by this in his church
[47:26] which is his body the bride till he
[47:28] could have the preeminence to express
[47:30] himself through them all right so that's
[47:32] not just a position of revealing now
[47:34] that's a position of intimacy and
[47:36] relationship and trust that causes
[47:38] something to come out amen the effect of
[47:41] the accepted revealing of christ to
[47:43] somebody leads christ to have the
[47:45] preeminence in somebody if you've truly
[47:47] accepted christ if you've truly seen a
[47:49] revelation of christ it's going to have
[47:51] a further effect in your life because
[47:53] many there saw jesus as a man of god
[47:56] remember nicodemus comes to him and says
[47:58] we know that thou art sent from god
[48:00] right but all of the pharisees and the
[48:02] sadducees saw that he was a man from god
[48:04] but it didn't stop them from trying to
[48:05] kill him why because they did not see it
[48:07] they did not have a full revelation of
[48:09] who he was there was no intimacy there
[48:11] there was no opening of who he truly was
[48:13] to them they just saw there's something
[48:15] different about him it's of god but we
[48:17] hate it
[48:18] right and that's where it stopped is
[48:19] they hated it because it exposed them
[48:21] for who they were
[48:22] and brother braham says this because the
[48:24] effect of christ in you is a new birth
[48:27] amen he says it's jesus christ the new
[48:29] birth revealed in you that he has the
[48:32] preeminences that he might express his
[48:34] words and anything that he's promised in
[48:36] these last days he can bring it to pass
[48:38] through his body as he's working so i we
[48:41] are as we've heard many times we are his
[48:43] hands and feet we are his voice and he
[48:46] works through us and that's what he's
[48:47] looking for is the preeminence the
[48:48] relationship of trust to where he can
[48:51] ask us to do something and we would do
[48:52] it without adding to it or taking away
[48:54] from it amen that we would speak only
[48:56] the word speak only what he's told us to
[48:58] do do only what he's told us to do when
[49:00] he tells us to do it and everything else
[49:02] will be left alone he says amen it's
[49:04] just exactly the word of god may
[49:06] manifest so what is it now you're not
[49:09] just bringing forth your life or your
[49:10] thoughts or your ideas but you're
[49:12] bringing forth his life in you amen and
[49:15] that's when you know that you have the
[49:16] preeminence inside of you it is and this
[49:19] also then moves to bring what other new
[49:21] births within the church brother brahm
[49:22] says if there are no new births in the
[49:24] church then the church is dead amen so
[49:26] we have to have new births we have to
[49:27] have converts coming in our children
[49:29] have to be getting the holy ghost
[49:31] otherwise what there is no relationships
[49:33] that's happening because with true
[49:34] intimacy life always comes forth
[49:37] eventually amen it may not come forth
[49:39] the first time but eventually if a man
[49:40] and a wife are intimate then life is
[49:43] going to come forth isn't it there's no
[49:44] denying it and you can't hide it because
[49:46] a birth always happens afterward
[49:48] then we have the third purpose and he
[49:50] says it is to restore the kingdom to its
[49:52] rightly position that fell by sin by the
[49:54] first adam back to where he walked in
[49:57] the cool of the evening with his people
[49:59] and talk with them and fellowship with
[50:01] them there so the end goal of all of
[50:03] this is to restore full fellowship back
[50:06] with the bride in christ to take us back
[50:08] to our eating condition because you
[50:09] remember at the very beginning it was
[50:11] just christ coming down and walking with
[50:13] adam in the cool of the evening and the
[50:15] serpent didn't walk the animals didn't
[50:17] walk there was nobody there but christ
[50:19] and his bride right and he's bringing us
[50:22] back to the place where it will only be
[50:24] his voice that we hear and all else's
[50:26] will be turned away so what we have here
[50:28] just to kind of put it on a on a a list
[50:31] here is we have the threefold purpose so
[50:32] one is the complete revealing of god to
[50:34] the bride through christ
[50:36] the second one is what to have the
[50:38] preeminence which is complete headship
[50:41] in the bride
[50:42] right and then the third one is to
[50:44] restore complete fellowship with the
[50:45] bride where it's just us and christ
[50:49] so if we see then if that is the purpose
[50:51] of god
[50:52] that there has to be some sort of role
[50:55] or response from the bride as that
[50:57] purpose is rolling out right because if
[50:59] he's if he's doing something if he has a
[51:01] purpose and that purpose has to be
[51:02] reflected in the bride because we see
[51:04] here that it's all in the bride that
[51:06] he's working he's trying to bring her
[51:07] back to some place so we should see a
[51:09] response we should see an effect in the
[51:11] bride with each stage as he goes through
[51:13] this right
[51:14] so the first one was the complete
[51:16] revealing of god to
[51:17] what the bride through christ so if
[51:19] there is a revealing there has to be
[51:21] somebody to recognize and accept who has
[51:24] been revealed to you and that's where we
[51:26] make a choice of headship in our life
[51:27] now we know that we are predestined to
[51:29] this but we also know that you can have
[51:31] salvation in christ without ever having
[51:33] the word inside of you amen those that
[51:35] believe they shall be saved
[51:37] right and they're the ones that are
[51:38] outside the city and these different
[51:40] things but for the true bride there is a
[51:42] spiritual response and that's we make a
[51:44] choice of headship in our life and
[51:45] that's when we give our life to christ
[51:47] amen that's when we come to the altar we
[51:49] repent and we're baptized and then we
[51:51] stay there until we receive the gift of
[51:53] the holy spirit
[51:54] right
[51:56] that's where we say i'm going to follow
[51:57] that and i'm going to leave everything
[51:59] else beside everything else goes to the
[52:01] side including myself amen we're going
[52:03] to put myself i'm going to choose to put
[52:05] myself under this head ship because i
[52:07] identify with it now the second thing is
[52:09] he's supposed to have complete and total
[52:12] preeminence which is complete headship
[52:14] amen now the second purpose of this was
[52:16] to get that preeminence so if he does
[52:18] that then god isn't just looking to have
[52:20] headship in us but he's looking to have
[52:22] headship with purpose and then god
[52:24] doesn't do this just to have you know
[52:26] robots or automatons in this world but
[52:28] he wants somebody that has such a tight
[52:30] relationship with him that he can trust
[52:32] her to do what he has asked her to do
[52:34] what he needs her to do because god is
[52:36] moving through our hands and our feet
[52:38] and our lips and these different things
[52:40] amen
[52:41] so what is he doing he's looking for a
[52:43] life that will reflect what she has
[52:45] accepted
[52:46] because if you have accepted headship
[52:48] then intimacy always follows and so the
[52:50] proof of that is that life comes out of
[52:52] you and it brings more and more life out
[52:54] of you amen and we know that the life
[52:56] never lies because if i if my wife is
[52:59] with another man then the dna doesn't
[53:01] match does it if we do a test of that
[53:02] baby then it's going to not be my wife
[53:05] plus john it's going to be my wife plus
[53:06] somebody else and it's no no different
[53:08] with the life of christ brother branham
[53:10] says the very life that he lives you
[53:11] have to live also otherwise it's another
[53:13] life that you have inside of you amen
[53:16] brother braham says this he says we have
[53:18] his name is that right we should bear
[53:20] his name and remember we are now as his
[53:22] bride pregnanted with his spirit oh my
[53:25] the church bearing children see pregnant
[53:28] by his spirit and his name bearing his
[53:31] name and bearing his life bringing forth
[53:33] the signs of his life evident with the
[53:35] preeminences evidence of his
[53:37] resurrection showing that he's not dead
[53:39] but alive forevermore this is eternal
[53:42] life and vindicated vindicates to the
[53:45] world that we are alive in him he says
[53:49] he says how do you know
[53:51] because you're a church member
[53:53] he says because christ is living through
[53:55] you so pregnant with his spirit that
[53:58] you're a prisoner to anything else
[54:00] you're confined oh my to the gospel
[54:03] confined to the word and all the
[54:05] children that you bring forth is that
[54:08] because you're a prisoner amen so he
[54:10] says you're not just bringing on life in
[54:12] your own walk but you're bringing what
[54:14] life to others as well you're a witness
[54:16] of christ to the world and that means
[54:18] that new lives will come out of your
[54:19] life as well and it's a cycle that never
[54:22] ends and like i said a church that's not
[54:23] having new births is dead
[54:25] amen i was watching a church the other
[54:27] day and somebody brought up a name and i
[54:29] looked it up and and all it was was old
[54:31] people in the church
[54:32] and i thought there's a problem there
[54:35] if the only young people are the
[54:36] pastor's kids and everybody else's kids
[54:38] have left we've got a problem don't we
[54:40] because it means that there's no new
[54:41] births happening something's wrong in
[54:43] that church because new births have to
[54:45] keep coming through amen
[54:47] and then the third purpose as we saw was
[54:49] to have true fellowship with his bride
[54:51] like it was in the in the garden of eden
[54:53] and so if god's looking for that then
[54:55] what is the bride's response to that the
[54:57] bride's response is that she will keep
[54:59] herself pure from outside influence or
[55:01] intimacy amen i've written here that
[55:03] she'll say yes to the word and no to all
[55:05] else so we'll cut ourselves off from
[55:07] every single influence relationship
[55:09] habit and medium maybe i should say
[55:11] media that is contrary to the word of
[55:14] god which is our husband so we'll take
[55:16] everything and put it aside and say i
[55:18] will only heed what the word of god says
[55:21] you know i was talking i think the last
[55:22] service about about healing and my
[55:24] sister and she you know when she got
[55:25] healed from cancer she didn't put
[55:27] anything in her house didn't put
[55:29] anything in front of her she didn't
[55:31] watch any movie she didn't read casual
[55:33] books she didn't do anything except she
[55:35] listened and read the word of god and
[55:37] that was it and that brought healing
[55:39] because it brought faith to her that
[55:41] what it was talking about was her and
[55:43] it's the same thing we're looking for
[55:44] here you're not going to get to the
[55:46] third place if you're feeding yourselves
[55:48] on the wrong things if you're dwelling
[55:49] on the wrong things it's going to put a
[55:51] different spirit inside of you and that
[55:52] gives satan an open door into your life
[55:54] right
[55:56] brother bran now now don't think for a
[55:58] second that other things aren't going to
[55:59] try and force their way in that's
[56:00] satan's job and he's really good at it
[56:02] but we do not willingly bring that into
[56:04] our lives into our homes in front of our
[56:06] faces but rather what we have to fight
[56:08] the battle as satan tries to introduce
[56:10] it into our lives that we keep it away
[56:12] and keep ourselves pure to the word so
[56:13] that there's no other life that's trying
[56:15] to come inside of us amen
[56:17] brother braham says this he says god
[56:19] wants another adam that stands with the
[56:21] word
[56:22] and him alone the word alone the word is
[56:24] right regardless he says now coming from
[56:26] the holy spirit what has come
[56:28] so he says after he gives you the holy
[56:30] spirit what comes next he says then he
[56:32] will give to you supernatural faith
[56:35] spiritual faith that's here at the
[56:36] bottom then that spiritual faith
[56:38] recognizes only the word no matter what
[56:41] anybody else says it don't do no good
[56:43] that only knows the word why because
[56:45] your faith is in the word and so your
[56:47] faith will only respond to the word so
[56:49] if you put something other than the word
[56:51] in front of you it will not cause faith
[56:53] to rise up what is the devil's faith the
[56:55] devil's faith is unbelief
[56:57] so if you're unbelieving it's because
[56:59] you've let the devil put something in
[57:00] front of you that you're responding to
[57:02] but if you put the word in front of you
[57:04] then your spiritual faith will rise up
[57:05] brother branham says he says it doesn't
[57:07] matter what anybody else says it won't
[57:09] do no good that only knows the word if
[57:11] somebody says the days of miracle is
[57:14] past that faith only knows the word
[57:16] we're praying for sister laura collins
[57:18] she's dead if god doesn't touch her and
[57:21] you know what she turned down a
[57:22] treatment this week that they said will
[57:24] give her an extra amount of lives but
[57:26] they said it'll cause you problems down
[57:28] the road she said what do i need that
[57:30] for
[57:30] as you guys might have read the email
[57:32] this morning if god's going to heal me
[57:33] then why would i put something in that's
[57:35] going to cause me problems down the road
[57:36] and she's resting on the faith that god
[57:39] is giving her through the word amen
[57:41] there's no such thing as the baptism of
[57:43] the holy ghost you look at some of these
[57:45] churches i watched a a portion of a
[57:47] service that that popped up the other
[57:49] day of a denominational church and it
[57:51] was dead as door nails and i thought
[57:53] what a shame because the commitment is
[57:55] there the people are showing up for
[57:57] service they're they're they're giving
[57:59] what they have
[58:02] excuse me but there was no life there
[58:04] it was like i was transported back to
[58:06] the 1700s again because they hadn't
[58:08] moved on as the word of god moved on
[58:10] amen and what they have no recognition
[58:12] of what it means to have the baptism of
[58:14] the holy ghost because they're back at
[58:15] justification and that's all they have
[58:17] and their their very worship reflects it
[58:19] the very words they preach it all
[58:20] reflects that they've only come to
[58:22] justification they haven't moved on to
[58:23] the sanctification baptism of the holy
[58:26] ghost
[58:27] so what you they would say there is no
[58:28] such thing they might say there is but
[58:30] they have no idea of what it is and if
[58:32] you told them what it was then they
[58:33] wouldn't accept it because they hadn't
[58:35] been there amen
[58:36] that faith only knows the word that's
[58:38] real spiritual faith you see
[58:40] now listen to this one
[58:42] he says now you'll never be able to get
[58:44] anything from god and have favor with
[58:46] god my brothers and sisters wherever you
[58:48] are until we fully obey the word of god
[58:51] we say amen but listen to this last bit
[58:53] he says you make yourself miserable by
[58:56] just half-heartedly approaching it
[58:59] halfway christianity is the most
[59:00] miserable place a person can be it's
[59:03] like being married half the time
[59:05] but only having the negative sides of
[59:08] marriage
[59:09] that's what it's like is because they're
[59:10] never going to have the positives in a
[59:12] halfway thing because you'll go in and
[59:14] come out as things are easy or as things
[59:16] look good and whatnot and you'll leave
[59:17] when things get hard and you'll never
[59:19] experience growth you'll never
[59:20] experience the
[59:22] the amazing relationship that comes with
[59:24] fighting through difficulty
[59:25] and then those difficulties tie you
[59:27] together and if you walk away every time
[59:30] things get tough then guess what your
[59:31] relationship doesn't go anywhere and
[59:33] it's no different with god if we keep
[59:34] turning away as things get tough as he
[59:36] calls us into a closer walk with him as
[59:38] he calls us to trust them further
[59:40] further if we turn away to the arm of
[59:42] flesh
[59:43] then we're never going to get all the
[59:44] way there and what is it it's a
[59:45] half-hearted christianity it's a
[59:47] half-hearted approach to prayer well
[59:49] i'll pray about it but if that doesn't
[59:51] work then i'll go to the bank and get a
[59:52] loan if that doesn't work then i'll move
[59:54] here if no no no commit yourself holy to
[59:57] god and stand still and see the
[59:58] salvation of the lord amen
[1:00:01] why because the real relationship with
[1:00:03] god brings you to a place where you're
[1:00:04] resting trusting and solely believing on
[1:00:07] the word of god that's where we rest
[1:00:09] that is our place of rest that's our
[1:00:10] pavilion that we that he talked about in
[1:00:12] psalms is the word of god is a shelter
[1:00:15] over us amen the bride has full
[1:00:17] relationship when she only hears one
[1:00:19] voice one voice and that's it and that's
[1:00:22] what her bridegroom which is christ the
[1:00:24] word and until then she's miserable
[1:00:26] you'll be miserable if you're listening
[1:00:28] even to mostly the word and something
[1:00:30] else because they are at conflict and
[1:00:32] you don't have rest when you have
[1:00:33] conflict of what you're listening to so
[1:00:35] we have to find that place where we're
[1:00:36] only listening to the one thing
[1:00:39] what is it we talked about that rest you
[1:00:41] know when and and it said you know if
[1:00:44] you are are like like abraham or you're
[1:00:46] like sarah who what they they they
[1:00:48] weren't uh worried with any amazement
[1:00:51] they were at rest about it and brother
[1:00:52] bam talks about what happens he says he
[1:00:55] says notice this character he's talking
[1:00:56] about women that aren't at rest he says
[1:00:58] notice this character when you see women
[1:01:00] just go on the rampage just doing
[1:01:03] anything they want to watch the church
[1:01:05] is doing the same thing
[1:01:07] notice but when the spiritual bride when
[1:01:09] she begins to have a revival what is a
[1:01:12] revival a revival is a separation from
[1:01:15] the things of the world and are coming
[1:01:16] back to the word he says how she begins
[1:01:18] to come back and line herself up with
[1:01:20] the word of god watch then again you see
[1:01:23] how that the scriptures that time
[1:01:25] there'll be a message sweep out to catch
[1:01:27] that bride and catch that woman elect
[1:01:30] that word you see women go on a rampage
[1:01:32] do you know the scripture talks about
[1:01:33] women going on a rampage
[1:01:35] and you know what kind of women it was
[1:01:37] devout and honorable is what the
[1:01:39] scripture says and there's two places
[1:01:41] where they got where they went on a
[1:01:42] rampage and you know what the first one
[1:01:44] was it was against the the apostles and
[1:01:47] the new gospel of jesus christ that's
[1:01:49] the first time they got stirred up the
[1:01:50] scripture talks about devout and
[1:01:52] honorable women these were the these
[1:01:54] were the the senior women in the jewish
[1:01:56] churches back then the ones that had the
[1:01:58] influence among you know the the aged
[1:02:00] women the respected women and they got
[1:02:02] stirred up against the gospel but then
[1:02:05] we see they get stirred up later and it
[1:02:07] is for the gospel
[1:02:09] both listed as devout and honorable but
[1:02:11] one was stirred up against the word and
[1:02:12] the other one was stirred up for the
[1:02:14] word and then we can't rest on what our
[1:02:16] we can't rest on our laurels we want to
[1:02:18] make sure that we're always truly devout
[1:02:20] and honorable to the word not just to
[1:02:22] our position or our ideas or our
[1:02:24] reputation and these different things
[1:02:25] amen but catch the difference here he
[1:02:27] says when they're off the word when
[1:02:29] they're not at rest they go on a rampage
[1:02:31] but when you're in a revival now you're
[1:02:33] submitting yourself and you're coming
[1:02:35] back and lining up with the word of god
[1:02:37] amen why because you're coming back to a
[1:02:39] place of rest a place where you're
[1:02:41] settled amen
[1:02:43] brother brown said this he said she's a
[1:02:46] type who the bride she has the same
[1:02:48] precious virtues by spirit given to her
[1:02:51] to preserve the spirit and the word and
[1:02:53] never commit adultery with anything of
[1:02:55] the world or anything stay virgin to the
[1:02:58] word as a woman is to stay virtuous to
[1:03:00] her husband it's a sacred trust to honor
[1:03:03] her lord's word above every man-made
[1:03:05] creed wisdom denomination there is the
[1:03:08] church is given that trust
[1:03:11] now listen to this he says what is a
[1:03:12] prostitute
[1:03:14] because he's showing us the opposite of
[1:03:15] what it means to be a pure and virtuous
[1:03:17] bride he says some woman that lives
[1:03:19] untrue to her husband but watch how he
[1:03:21] defines it he says claiming to be a
[1:03:24] christian church and giving out wrong
[1:03:26] doctrine her own stuff instead of taking
[1:03:30] god's holy word so she has a message she
[1:03:32] has an idea she has a thought that is
[1:03:34] contrary to the word and what makes her
[1:03:36] a prostitute is that she starts to
[1:03:38] spread her stuff instead of his stuff
[1:03:41] that's what makes her a prostitute she's
[1:03:43] not taking his life she's trying to give
[1:03:44] her own to somebody else amen
[1:03:47] so that's the big picture that's the
[1:03:48] threefold purpose of christ and then we
[1:03:50] have the threefold response of the bride
[1:03:53] to those things now when we start to
[1:03:55] talk about true womanhood we'll see that
[1:03:57] it fits beautifully inside of those
[1:03:59] three things again amen
[1:04:01] because if god has a natural plan or a
[1:04:04] spiritual plan then there ought to be a
[1:04:05] natural plan that types right along with
[1:04:07] it as well now listen to what brother
[1:04:08] branham says because he talks about the
[1:04:11] the sacred virtues and trusts and
[1:04:13] responsibilities of women so he sets us
[1:04:15] up here and he says what a sacred trust
[1:04:17] what a responsibility to a woman now see
[1:04:20] why she's a type of the church which has
[1:04:21] the same responsibility as a woman has a
[1:04:24] sake of responsibility to her motherhood
[1:04:26] to her virtues to her husband the church
[1:04:29] has a sacred responsibility to prayer
[1:04:32] and to the word and to christ just the
[1:04:34] same as the woman has amen
[1:04:38] so after all of this there's one thing i
[1:04:40] want you to see in this and that's that
[1:04:42] the bride does not lead
[1:04:45] okay everything is is started by christ
[1:04:48] and it's responded to by the bride the
[1:04:50] bride does not initiate christ initiates
[1:04:52] and then the bride says yes or no and as
[1:04:54] soon as she says yes then she's bound to
[1:04:56] go through all the way to the finish
[1:04:58] amen but she's not leading she's
[1:05:00] responding to leadership when it comes
[1:05:02] to these things and that's where the
[1:05:03] attitude comes in and that's that's
[1:05:05] where we see that
[1:05:06] in order to get all the way there she
[1:05:08] has to follow his leading she cannot
[1:05:10] leave herself to that amen as we read in
[1:05:12] the in the last service of this series
[1:05:14] he's bound to her because she is not
[1:05:16] just a part of him but she is him that's
[1:05:19] literally what it says is she is him
[1:05:21] she's not a part of him she is him she's
[1:05:23] just in a separate body and then what we
[1:05:25] have is we have the union of christ the
[1:05:27] head with the body and now they're one
[1:05:28] and the same and that's why we didn't
[1:05:30] have to have the sun and the moon in the
[1:05:31] new heavens the new earth and the new
[1:05:32] jerusalem was because the type has
[1:05:34] already been fulfilled you don't have to
[1:05:36] have a son to move because now they're
[1:05:37] one in the same thing amen
[1:05:40] why what is it she's going to stay with
[1:05:42] the word because what he's given her
[1:05:43] will meet the need that's where her
[1:05:45] trust is amen now let's take it back to
[1:05:47] the scriptures we're going to go now to
[1:05:48] the to the natural side of things
[1:05:51] and titus 2.
[1:05:53] and paul says this he says but speak
[1:05:54] thou the things which become sound
[1:05:56] doctrine so this is the sound doctrine
[1:05:58] that paul is going to share now he says
[1:06:00] that the aged men be sober grave
[1:06:03] temperate sound and faith in charity and
[1:06:06] impatience
[1:06:07] then he says the age of women likewise
[1:06:09] that they be in behavior as becometh
[1:06:12] holiness
[1:06:13] not false accusers not given to much
[1:06:15] wine teachers of good things so our
[1:06:18] older sisters are supposed to be
[1:06:20] teachers of good things and i want you
[1:06:22] to notice that this is where you end up
[1:06:24] this is not where you start you do not
[1:06:26] start out as aged you do not start out
[1:06:28] as as all of these things with the the
[1:06:30] perfect behavior and the ability to
[1:06:33] teach you come to a place where you can
[1:06:35] teach but first you have to learn and
[1:06:37] grow and experience the reality of the
[1:06:38] world before you have the authority to
[1:06:40] teach these things as we've said before
[1:06:43] young men don't teach sideways no they
[1:06:45] only teach down and they never teach up
[1:06:47] and it's the same thing for young
[1:06:48] sisters they can teach down to children
[1:06:50] they do not cheat they do not teach
[1:06:51] laterally and they definitely don't
[1:06:53] preach up because you have to have a
[1:06:55] life by experience that proves that you
[1:06:57] know what you're talking about
[1:06:59] amen we can all read the bible we can
[1:07:01] all read the bible and see the truth of
[1:07:03] it but we have to live the truth before
[1:07:04] we can teach the truth because you'll
[1:07:06] find and i have found in myself that
[1:07:08] what you think the word means sometimes
[1:07:10] is not really what it means when you get
[1:07:11] down to a real life experience and then
[1:07:13] you start trying to talk about love
[1:07:15] without having an experience with christ
[1:07:16] and without going through a few
[1:07:17] hardships you don't know love until you
[1:07:19] go through and you deal with a situation
[1:07:21] where it seems like you can't love
[1:07:23] somebody but you fight through to that
[1:07:24] place where brother bram says you get
[1:07:26] down in your prayer closet and you kneel
[1:07:27] down you pray until god gives you a
[1:07:29] revelation of what's causing it he says
[1:07:30] and then you bring them before the
[1:07:31] throne of grace rather than cursing them
[1:07:34] amen how are you going to preach about
[1:07:35] love if you've never experienced that
[1:07:37] how are you going to talk about marriage
[1:07:38] if you've never been married how are you
[1:07:39] going to talk about parenting if you've
[1:07:41] never parented right we all have a
[1:07:43] chuckle
[1:07:44] because when we start our marriages i've
[1:07:46] said it before we say i'm not going to
[1:07:47] be like the other people
[1:07:49] and then we're all like all of the other
[1:07:50] people aren't we then we say i'm not
[1:07:52] going to make the mistakes my parents
[1:07:53] did and then we go and make the mistakes
[1:07:55] the mistakes our parents did right why
[1:07:57] because we all have to learn and grow
[1:07:59] and while we might have a head knowledge
[1:08:00] of it the funny thing is life
[1:08:02] experiences slip in really quickly and
[1:08:04] it catches the unawares and you end up
[1:08:05] doing the exact same thing that you
[1:08:06] didn't want to do
[1:08:08] sometimes we learn most times we have to
[1:08:09] go through it by experience and that's
[1:08:11] why we teach is because we have an
[1:08:12] experience not because we've read the
[1:08:14] bible
[1:08:15] so what are they supposed to teach the
[1:08:16] young woman it says that they teach the
[1:08:18] young women to be sober
[1:08:20] you have to be taught to be sober
[1:08:24] you have to be taught to love your
[1:08:26] husbands and to love their children so
[1:08:28] like i said notice it's something that
[1:08:29] you learn you are born knowing it all
[1:08:31] you learn you grow you mature and you
[1:08:33] get better at it guess what when that
[1:08:35] baby comes out mama you don't
[1:08:37] instinctively know how to do everything
[1:08:38] that's required when you get married you
[1:08:41] don't instinctively know everything you
[1:08:42] need to do as a husband or as a wife to
[1:08:45] meet the needs of your spouse and to do
[1:08:47] things right you have to learn and grow
[1:08:49] and that is by teaching it is by
[1:08:51] teaching of the elders in the church the
[1:08:52] elder women and the elder men and of
[1:08:54] times it's our parents typically that
[1:08:56] will that if we can humble ourselves and
[1:08:58] say i'm struggling then they'll say oh
[1:08:59] yeah i've been through that here's what
[1:09:00] you do and we do it magically it works
[1:09:02] and we move on with life and now we have
[1:09:03] an experience to match what we've talked
[1:09:05] about right
[1:09:07] but this is something we grow and we
[1:09:09] learn at so if you're not there take
[1:09:10] heart you're not supposed to be
[1:09:13] when he gave you the holy ghost you have
[1:09:14] the potential for everything but we
[1:09:16] don't just have a download of every
[1:09:17] single
[1:09:18] action and response that we need in life
[1:09:20] every bit of knowledge that's supposed
[1:09:22] to be there no we grow and learn it's a
[1:09:24] time thing it's not something we get
[1:09:25] immediately
[1:09:26] but listen to what else they have to
[1:09:27] teach them to be discreet
[1:09:30] chaste keepers at home good obedient to
[1:09:33] their own husbands that the word of god
[1:09:35] be not blaspheme so the purpose of all
[1:09:37] this sound doctrine is to do one thing
[1:09:40] and that's to keep the word of god from
[1:09:41] being blasphemed in other words to keep
[1:09:43] from bringing a reproach on the word of
[1:09:45] god now that's something for all of us
[1:09:47] that's not exclusive to the sisters by
[1:09:48] any means is that our life is supposed
[1:09:50] to keep from bringing a reproach on the
[1:09:52] word of god amen
[1:09:55] it's like i said before the defining
[1:09:57] role as we typically see it for women is
[1:09:59] always related to marriage and family
[1:10:01] and that's where paul typically goes
[1:10:02] that's where jesus went that's where the
[1:10:04] different ones go there's a place
[1:10:06] outside of that but inside of this is
[1:10:07] really what we're going to be looking at
[1:10:09] is the type of the bride and christ amen
[1:10:11] like we said before there are those that
[1:10:13] are called to be single
[1:10:14] and with them they are not excluded from
[1:10:17] all of this but rather their energy is
[1:10:18] given now to pleasing christ rather than
[1:10:20] pleasing their husband and same with the
[1:10:22] men that are they're a eunuch to correct
[1:10:24] to god they are not now to please their
[1:10:25] wives but they're to please christ i
[1:10:27] mean their their soul focus everything
[1:10:29] they're doing is to meet the needs and
[1:10:30] the purpose of christ whereas when you
[1:10:32] get married as paul says about it or
[1:10:33] jesus talks about it he says that what
[1:10:35] you're committed to to working with your
[1:10:37] spouse to meeting their needs before god
[1:10:39] that's a that's
[1:10:41] it's through christ that we live and
[1:10:42] have these relationships but he says
[1:10:43] you've got a commitment now that you've
[1:10:44] got to meet and it takes away your
[1:10:46] energy and time and that's your bigger
[1:10:48] focus in life is to is to make that
[1:10:50] marriage and relationship work
[1:10:52] but let's start with a simple quote here
[1:10:53] to get us moving
[1:10:55] he says a woman is entrusted with
[1:10:57] certain characteristics that she must
[1:10:58] not defile a woman is trusted to that
[1:11:01] and there's not a creature on earth like
[1:11:04] a woman
[1:11:05] he says the woman has got a great place
[1:11:07] it's a sacred nice wonderful place but
[1:11:11] she must keep herself that way to hold
[1:11:13] her office as she should as a mother as
[1:11:16] a woman and of womanhood when the
[1:11:18] womanhood is broke the backbone of any
[1:11:20] nation is broke and that's the reason
[1:11:22] today our nation is ruined is because of
[1:11:24] the immorals of our women that's exactly
[1:11:26] right sure it's the rottenness among us
[1:11:28] what's breaking it he says what you need
[1:11:30] is to meet this melchizedek one time
[1:11:32] amen let him bless you and give you the
[1:11:34] wine that bread eternal life then you'll
[1:11:37] see things different then it'll be
[1:11:39] different so he says we that our sisters
[1:11:41] have a special set of characteristics or
[1:11:44] virtues or trusts that are special to
[1:11:46] her and her alone and she's to guard and
[1:11:48] protect those and it's what makes her
[1:11:50] unique and special so he says notice
[1:11:53] this is the invisible union now that's
[1:11:55] committed to her sacred virtue and
[1:11:58] sacred womanhood and then sacred
[1:12:00] motherhood and then to honor her husband
[1:12:04] he says now we find out that she's been
[1:12:06] given the sacred trust that she must not
[1:12:09] break of womanhood act have her
[1:12:11] character raise her children to be
[1:12:14] honorable to her husband now i want to
[1:12:16] break each one of those down a little
[1:12:17] bit to make kind of make it obvious
[1:12:19] about what he's talking about there and
[1:12:21] had to spend some time because he blends
[1:12:22] things together and you start to wonder
[1:12:24] which one is which because he says
[1:12:25] there's three but he lists five or six
[1:12:27] in some of these these things so he
[1:12:28] breaks it down as he goes through the
[1:12:30] service amen but i want you to to just
[1:12:32] realize that these are things that he
[1:12:33] calls characters
[1:12:35] characteristics virtues and trusts that
[1:12:37] strengths and things that are committed
[1:12:39] to you to take care of
[1:12:40] and then so there's something that's
[1:12:41] special about these things and and and
[1:12:44] this is a special role that us us men
[1:12:46] can't identify with because while we
[1:12:48] have it in type to christ we don't carry
[1:12:50] it physically emotionally and these
[1:12:52] things the way our sisters do so they
[1:12:53] are they really get into this in a way
[1:12:55] that that we don't we don't have to deal
[1:12:57] with in the same way and it's it's a
[1:12:58] tough place to be i'm sure
[1:13:00] amen now so the first thing that brother
[1:13:02] brahm says you start with is your
[1:13:03] womanhood and he says that is the way
[1:13:05] you act and your character and he says
[1:13:08] it's reflected physically in your body
[1:13:11] so he says here but because she was cast
[1:13:12] over in that side she has also been
[1:13:15] given a sacred charge from god for
[1:13:18] redemption
[1:13:19] but she's got characteristics that she
[1:13:21] must not defile if she would marry them
[1:13:23] she is defiled for lifetime no matter
[1:13:26] how much she is forgiven she can't be
[1:13:28] justified now remember justified means
[1:13:31] what you never did it in the first place
[1:13:33] but he says physically a woman cannot be
[1:13:36] justified again she can't go back to the
[1:13:38] way she was okay once her once her once
[1:13:41] that virtue is broken in her body if i
[1:13:43] could put it that way in a mixed crowd
[1:13:44] once that virtue is broken there's no
[1:13:46] fixing it again right the proof is there
[1:13:48] and she can't go tell another guy oh
[1:13:50] yeah i've only been with you right the
[1:13:52] physical proof is already evident in her
[1:13:53] body and she can't go back and fix that
[1:13:55] again
[1:13:56] right he says i'll strike that in a
[1:13:58] little bit i've got a scripture on that
[1:13:59] in a few minutes she can be forgiven for
[1:14:02] her defilement but she cannot be
[1:14:03] justified in this life it's always with
[1:14:05] her notice now she's been given this she
[1:14:07] may be forgiven but not justified
[1:14:11] he says her body is given to her a
[1:14:13] sacred trust from god no female dog no
[1:14:16] bird no other animal no other creature
[1:14:18] is like that no she's the only one and i
[1:14:20] looked it up and there is no other
[1:14:22] female creature on the planet that has
[1:14:25] all of them the same physical proof and
[1:14:27] body of virtue it's only the woman that
[1:14:29] has that and that's an amazing thing
[1:14:31] and there's no real reason for it except
[1:14:34] for what the scripture says and that's
[1:14:35] that it is a virtue to her and it's
[1:14:37] given to her above all other creatures
[1:14:40] right it's an amazing thing it says the
[1:14:42] reason it's so sacred she is to bring
[1:14:45] forth life into the earth her body is
[1:14:48] the betting grounds of life therefore
[1:14:50] that's the reason she is give this
[1:14:51] sacred trust she has a sacred trust of
[1:14:54] virtue committed to her by her lord a
[1:14:57] certain virtue nothing else holds it but
[1:14:59] a woman right that's committed to her by
[1:15:01] god and she must not defile that virtue
[1:15:04] amen eve did and it caused the whole
[1:15:06] world to go into sin
[1:15:08] that's why he says you're not supposed
[1:15:09] to break it why because there's a power
[1:15:11] and an influence available to woman to
[1:15:14] use that virtue as a temptation to a man
[1:15:16] right and eve succumbed to the
[1:15:18] sensuality of the serpent and gave that
[1:15:21] to him and it caused us all to go into a
[1:15:22] fall and now women have realized that
[1:15:24] there's pop well they realize it for a
[1:15:25] long time it's nothing new but they've
[1:15:27] realized that they have a power to offer
[1:15:29] that thing to a man and it's something
[1:15:31] that will draw him and give her power
[1:15:32] over him but it's not what she's meant
[1:15:34] to do she's supposed to save it for the
[1:15:36] one that she chooses rather than give it
[1:15:39] to a man to have power over him amen
[1:15:42] so they're called to bring for life and
[1:15:43] the virtue is for a woman is that she
[1:15:45] will accept a man and let him alone
[1:15:47] bring life through her body amen a man
[1:15:50] can't force her she has to accept it and
[1:15:52] then no man has a right to force a woman
[1:15:54] to marry him he offers and then she
[1:15:56] accepts it amen and once she says yes to
[1:15:58] the one man she can't pretend later that
[1:16:01] she didn't say yes like i said the proof
[1:16:03] is in her body she can't go to the next
[1:16:04] man and say you're the first one i've
[1:16:06] ever been with because the proof is in
[1:16:08] her body right
[1:16:11] he says now notice now she has a sacred
[1:16:13] trust a virtue that's been given to her
[1:16:15] entrusted to her by the lord god gave
[1:16:18] her that virtue just as it was in the
[1:16:19] garden of eden she can say yes or no she
[1:16:22] has a sacred trust of womanhood
[1:16:24] committed to her that she must not break
[1:16:25] the womanhood i'm speaking of here is
[1:16:27] her conduct her character around men now
[1:16:30] our sisters can have 10
[1:16:32] offers of marriage ten proposals
[1:16:35] but she chooses whichever one that she
[1:16:37] wants
[1:16:38] right that's what brother brown says
[1:16:39] your virtue is in saying yes or no you
[1:16:42] get to make that choice
[1:16:44] any man can come up and make a proposal
[1:16:46] but it's up to you to say yes or no and
[1:16:48] until you say yes he's not allowed to
[1:16:50] touch you and you have a right to
[1:16:51] protect your virtue
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:53] what is it the first test of womanhood
[1:16:56] for our sisters is keeping yourself set
[1:16:58] aside and saying no until the one time
[1:17:00] and the one man you say yes to amen amen
[1:17:03] so let's take it back to our threefold
[1:17:05] purpose because if we look here what we
[1:17:07] have was we had the revealing of god
[1:17:10] then we have a recognition and
[1:17:11] acceptance of that and then we take it
[1:17:12] to the natural type and the woman says
[1:17:14] yes or no to marriage and intimacy you
[1:17:17] get to choose that right every woman
[1:17:19] that's married in this church as far as
[1:17:20] i know had a choice
[1:17:22] right daddy didn't make her
[1:17:24] she chose to accept that husband's
[1:17:26] proposal amen so what i'm saying here
[1:17:29] she chooses who will be fully revealed
[1:17:30] to her and there's only one again mixed
[1:17:33] crowd you know what i'm talking about
[1:17:34] the adults doing man there's only one
[1:17:36] man that's going to be fully revealed to
[1:17:37] that woman and vice versa and she
[1:17:39] chooses who that man is and that's her
[1:17:41] first virtue amen then brother branham
[1:17:43] goes after this and he says look where
[1:17:44] hollywood's taking us he says he talks
[1:17:46] about you know they're slopping all over
[1:17:48] each other and kissing and and i don't
[1:17:50] even know if they ever had a movie where
[1:17:52] they had two people in the same bed i
[1:17:54] don't know if lucy you know i love lucy
[1:17:56] that if they got to that point but i
[1:17:57] mean these days everything is right you
[1:17:59] got p actors that aren't married
[1:18:00] sleeping in bed dude i mean it's total
[1:18:03] and completely animalistic filth that we
[1:18:05] have now but he says it started in
[1:18:06] hollywood and what it's done is it's
[1:18:08] numb the senses of the men and the women
[1:18:11] to the point where they see no virtue
[1:18:12] and holding yourself your body sacred
[1:18:14] right it's mine i can do with it you
[1:18:16] absolutely can but if you don't hold
[1:18:18] yourself true to this we see that in
[1:18:20] some populations in some areas young
[1:18:22] women there's a 25 percent std rate
[1:18:25] one in four
[1:18:27] that's scary why because they have such
[1:18:29] a promiscuous attitude because there's
[1:18:31] no virtue there they haven't recognized
[1:18:33] the sacredness of your body it's funny
[1:18:35] it's not funny it's interesting to me
[1:18:37] how there's so many things that we're
[1:18:38] protected by that have a physical effect
[1:18:40] in our bodies if we follow the word of
[1:18:42] god and one of those things is in this
[1:18:44] nature on the central side of things is
[1:18:46] that if you protect yourself and keep to
[1:18:48] one then you're almost generally never
[1:18:50] going to ever have a problem with those
[1:18:51] things
[1:18:53] if you choose one then you protect your
[1:18:54] body and your you protect your partner
[1:18:56] at the same time
[1:18:58] he says be in your heart and let christ
[1:19:00] have first place like the real woman
[1:19:02] would to her husband no other arms could
[1:19:04] touch her now nowhere so once she says
[1:19:06] yes no other man's supposed to hug her
[1:19:08] right no other kiss no matter how
[1:19:10] charming it looks she turned her head so
[1:19:12] every offer of it she turns her head
[1:19:14] she's got one set love and that's for
[1:19:16] her husband that's right no matter how
[1:19:18] handsome the man might be and how
[1:19:20] polished and slick his hair might look
[1:19:22] and how he might hold himself correct no
[1:19:24] sir not one thing she loves that husband
[1:19:26] and that's him alone does she love i
[1:19:28] know a sister that was going to see a
[1:19:30] doctor she's married
[1:19:32] and she felt an attraction to that
[1:19:34] doctor so you know what she did she
[1:19:36] stopped going to that doctor she cut it
[1:19:38] off nothing's going to stop us from
[1:19:40] having attractions and and temptations
[1:19:42] in life but what did she do she cut it
[1:19:44] off and said this could go a very bad
[1:19:45] place i'm making sure i never go in that
[1:19:47] bad place why because she knew her
[1:19:49] virtue was for her husband and she
[1:19:51] didn't even with the body saying yes
[1:19:53] everything in her says no that is not
[1:19:55] what i do and she cut herself off from
[1:19:56] that
[1:19:57] he says she forfeits all of her virtues
[1:20:00] and all of her kisses it's kind of a
[1:20:01] funny thing to say but what he's saying
[1:20:03] is physically she gives herself to no
[1:20:05] man all her lovings and everything is to
[1:20:07] her husband and him alone so see what i
[1:20:09] mean
[1:20:09] and you forfeit everything in the world
[1:20:11] no matter how good it looks how pretty
[1:20:13] it looks and how fascinating it looks
[1:20:15] your virtue is what you're counted by
[1:20:17] and then you say oh hallelujah i know i
[1:20:19] got it because i did this hallelujah he
[1:20:21] says enough temper to buy to fight a
[1:20:22] buzzsaw he's talking about christians
[1:20:24] that say i got it i got it i'm committed
[1:20:25] to christ and he says you got a temper
[1:20:27] that would fight a buzzsaw he says
[1:20:29] there's something wrong there because
[1:20:30] the life hasn't been changed yet he said
[1:20:32] let me tell you brother it takes virtue
[1:20:34] that christ respects he says you are
[1:20:37] born again of god you've got the beauty
[1:20:39] of the holy ghost to show that what you
[1:20:40] are you are what you say you are is what
[1:20:42] you are you've got virtue that these
[1:20:44] scandal skirts don't have that's right a
[1:20:47] real woman of god that stands out with
[1:20:48] virtue you might be laughed at and
[1:20:50] called old-fashioned but you've got
[1:20:52] something that they can't touch and
[1:20:54] you've done and they've done lost it and
[1:20:56] can never have it again that's right but
[1:20:58] he says you've got virtue that's what
[1:21:01] god looks for is virtue
[1:21:03] and once that woman says yes and she
[1:21:05] gives over that virtue to her husband
[1:21:07] life changes drastically because she's
[1:21:09] not allowed to take it back
[1:21:11] right she can't take it back and say no
[1:21:13] once she makes that commitment when he
[1:21:15] makes once he makes the offer and she
[1:21:16] takes it she's not allowed to take it
[1:21:18] back and it has to progress all the way
[1:21:20] to full intimacy there has to be a full
[1:21:22] revealing and there has to be a
[1:21:24] consummation of the marriage amen so
[1:21:26] what brother brown calls that he says is
[1:21:28] what he calls it sacred motherhood and
[1:21:30] that's when she bears her husband's
[1:21:32] children so she produces his life and
[1:21:34] she can prove it by the blood prove it
[1:21:36] by the dna amen that what his life was
[1:21:39] inside of her and only his life was
[1:21:41] inside of her and what come out of her
[1:21:43] then was exactly what went in which was
[1:21:45] him amen
[1:21:46] it confirms that the marriage has been
[1:21:48] fully consummated amen it's now not just
[1:21:50] intimate relationship but it's moved
[1:21:52] into new life and that's what we saw for
[1:21:54] the bride remember is that she brings
[1:21:55] forth a new life the same thing for a
[1:21:57] natural wife as she brings forth new
[1:21:59] life
[1:22:00] now listen to this
[1:22:02] we're talking about the sacred
[1:22:04] motherhood part now
[1:22:05] the second virtue he says adam was not
[1:22:07] deceived but the woman being deceived
[1:22:09] was in the transgression notwithstanding
[1:22:11] she shall be saved in childbearing if
[1:22:15] they continue in faith and charity and
[1:22:17] holiness and with sobriety now we have
[1:22:19] to be real careful here because somebody
[1:22:20] will read that and say you're trying to
[1:22:22] equate marriage and having children to
[1:22:24] salvation and that's not what this word
[1:22:26] means this is not salvation that saves
[1:22:28] you this is not the salvation of calvary
[1:22:30] that we're talking about but this is a
[1:22:32] salvation that has an effect in your
[1:22:33] life and when you look up that word in
[1:22:36] the
[1:22:36] the root word it says this word is that
[1:22:39] she will be made whole
[1:22:41] she will be saved from destruction
[1:22:43] she'll be kept safe and sound and saved
[1:22:46] from the evils which keeps a person from
[1:22:48] accepting the gospel so is there
[1:22:50] something about raising children about
[1:22:52] having children that has an effect on
[1:22:54] the life of a woman
[1:22:56] and it is a positive thing and the
[1:22:57] scripture calls it saving it saves her
[1:23:00] and if i could put it this way oft times
[1:23:02] it saves her from herself
[1:23:05] now we'll continue on because paul talks
[1:23:06] about in titus 2 where we read in verse
[1:23:08] 5 it says they're teaching them to do
[1:23:10] what to be sober to love their husbands
[1:23:12] to love their children to be discreet
[1:23:14] chaste keepers at home good obedient to
[1:23:16] their own husbands again why that the
[1:23:19] word of god be not blasphemed because
[1:23:22] they're being taught in all of these
[1:23:23] things in marriage and having and
[1:23:25] raising children it's to keep them from
[1:23:27] what blaspheming the word of god in
[1:23:30] first timothy 5 it says i will therefore
[1:23:32] that the younger women marry
[1:23:34] bear children guide the house give none
[1:23:37] occasion to the adversary to speak
[1:23:39] reproachfully in other words don't bring
[1:23:41] a reproach on the word he says for some
[1:23:44] have already turned aside after satan
[1:23:47] and what brought a reproach on the word
[1:23:49] of god
[1:23:50] because why women running around without
[1:23:53] headship don't let generally get led to
[1:23:55] the word of god
[1:23:56] right they're supposed to be under
[1:23:58] headship and we've covered it in the in
[1:24:01] the last portion of the series we did
[1:24:02] where we talked to denominations which
[1:24:04] were typed by women and we talked about
[1:24:06] the requirements of those headship and
[1:24:07] we saw what happened with satan's queen
[1:24:09] is that she completely divorced herself
[1:24:11] from any sort of headship and she got to
[1:24:13] the point where she ruled all just
[1:24:15] before she's judged for it all and
[1:24:16] everybody that was with her gets judged
[1:24:18] along with it so she brings total
[1:24:20] destruction through her own headship
[1:24:21] amen what paul is saying here in these
[1:24:24] different places is it keeps her out of
[1:24:25] trouble that she might otherwise get
[1:24:26] into is that in the marriage and in the
[1:24:29] having children it puts her in a place
[1:24:31] that it takes up some of that energy
[1:24:32] that can be put into things that she
[1:24:34] shouldn't be into
[1:24:35] brother branham he says it's a great
[1:24:36] honor and a great respect for a woman to
[1:24:38] do this he says a good woman is a jewel
[1:24:40] in a man's crown she should be honored
[1:24:43] brothers how much do we honor our wives
[1:24:46] does josh get ready to honor your wife
[1:24:48] amen they ought to be honored they ought
[1:24:51] to be honored for what they do and as
[1:24:53] many of us know if you take care of your
[1:24:54] kids for a day or two while mom has gone
[1:24:56] on vacation or a week or two weeks as as
[1:24:58] some of us have had to do you get a much
[1:25:01] deeper respect for the amount of work
[1:25:03] and effort that goes into it
[1:25:05] it's no wonder that they can't get into
[1:25:07] trouble it's because they have no
[1:25:08] strength left after a day isn't that
[1:25:10] right sister rebecca isn't it you have
[1:25:13] to do everything listen i i when my day
[1:25:16] is done and i'm done work i might study
[1:25:17] for three or four hours but when it's
[1:25:19] still done i get to come upstairs and
[1:25:20] read a book but guess what my wife is
[1:25:23] going non-stop now she has the option to
[1:25:25] occasionally stop at times throughout
[1:25:26] the day and that but she wakes up early
[1:25:29] and she stays up late and it's all
[1:25:30] filled with dealing with the household
[1:25:32] and the children and and then taking
[1:25:34] care of her poor husband too right
[1:25:36] it's a non-stop job and brother brahm
[1:25:38] says you need to honor that woman that
[1:25:40] is an amazing role that she is in and
[1:25:43] she is giving her all to that
[1:25:45] she's giving her body to it amen our
[1:25:48] sisters they you know they're young and
[1:25:49] they're beautiful and they're fit and
[1:25:51] they do all these things and then what
[1:25:52] happens they have a baby and guess what
[1:25:54] they're never the same again they can
[1:25:56] never physically be the same again they
[1:25:58] can they can do everything they want
[1:25:59] they can do every type of surgery they
[1:26:00] can exercise guess what your body is
[1:26:02] never the same again after you bring
[1:26:04] forth life guess what our life is never
[1:26:06] the same again is it after we have a new
[1:26:08] birth isn't it right everything changes
[1:26:10] after that and you can never go back to
[1:26:12] it and brother brown says what this is
[1:26:14] an amazing place she's a jewel in a
[1:26:16] man's crown he says i've got thousands
[1:26:18] of christian sisters who i highly
[1:26:19] respect
[1:26:21] it's an amazing thing for these sisters
[1:26:23] that
[1:26:24] us brothers we don't have to deal with
[1:26:26] much in the in terms of the way the
[1:26:27] world looks at us but our sisters have a
[1:26:29] lot
[1:26:30] outwardly they have a lot amen and then
[1:26:33] the attitude that they're supposed to
[1:26:34] show and the responses that they have
[1:26:36] it's a tough place to be satan is going
[1:26:39] around like a roaring lion and our
[1:26:40] sisters are getting the brunt of it i do
[1:26:42] feel
[1:26:43] right it's a tough place to be he says
[1:26:46] but if they can respect what god made
[1:26:48] them motherhood and a real queen that's
[1:26:50] all right she's one of the best things
[1:26:52] that god could give a man he says in
[1:26:53] other places he says she is the best
[1:26:55] thing aside from salvation as we read he
[1:26:57] said was a wife
[1:26:58] there he says it beside salvation a wife
[1:27:00] is the best thing if she's a good wife
[1:27:02] see i read so many things i start to
[1:27:04] repeat them and not realize they're
[1:27:05] right there in my notes right
[1:27:07] he says but if she isn't
[1:27:09] if she isn't solomon said a good woman
[1:27:11] is a jewel in man's crown but an ornery
[1:27:13] one or a no good one is water in his
[1:27:15] blood what happens when water's in your
[1:27:17] blood your blood gets too thin and it
[1:27:18] can't it it just doesn't go the way it
[1:27:21] needs to go it's too thin it can't
[1:27:22] provide what it needs
[1:27:23] he says that's right it's the worst
[1:27:25] thing could happen so a good woman if
[1:27:27] you've got a good wife brother you ought
[1:27:28] to respect her with the highest that's
[1:27:30] right you should do it so when's the
[1:27:32] last time we did it brothers
[1:27:34] when's the last time we went out of our
[1:27:35] way to show respect and honor in front
[1:27:37] of our kids in front of the church
[1:27:39] however it might be to take the time to
[1:27:41] show her that you're honoring and
[1:27:43] respecting the time and effort and
[1:27:45] energy that she puts into it
[1:27:47] while expecting her to be perfectly
[1:27:50] respectful
[1:27:51] and submissive to you at the same time
[1:27:53] one thing to just do the work it's
[1:27:54] another thing to do with the right
[1:27:55] attitude tough place to be
[1:27:58] amen
[1:27:59] a real woman and children if you've got
[1:28:01] a real mother that stays home and tries
[1:28:02] to take care of you keeping your clothes
[1:28:04] clean sending you to school teaching you
[1:28:06] about jesus you should honor that sweet
[1:28:08] old mother that's with all that's in you
[1:28:10] you should respect that woman yes sir
[1:28:12] because she's a real mother
[1:28:15] he says the greatest honor a woman can
[1:28:16] do outside of coming to christ and being
[1:28:18] loyal to her husband is to have a baby
[1:28:20] now remember
[1:28:21] bringing souls to the kingdom is what's
[1:28:23] important what he says if you're a
[1:28:25] believing husband and wife then you're
[1:28:26] bringing forth we believe believing
[1:28:28] children
[1:28:29] now there's no guarantee of that but we
[1:28:31] would believe that if we were christians
[1:28:32] then we would have sons and daughters of
[1:28:34] god amen he says you might be nursing a
[1:28:36] little preacher how do you know
[1:28:38] praise the lord
[1:28:40] right you might bring one life but that
[1:28:41] out of that one life could come what a
[1:28:43] million souls a hundred souls a thousand
[1:28:45] souls what doesn't matter one soul one
[1:28:47] more soul that you couldn't bear out of
[1:28:49] your body but because you had a child
[1:28:51] that would come and be a preacher or
[1:28:53] make a witness of it now they could
[1:28:54] bring more souls to christ he says
[1:28:56] hallelujah i know that's old-fashioned
[1:28:58] cornbread type but brother it'll stick
[1:29:00] to your ribs it'll do what you're dying
[1:29:02] it sure will
[1:29:03] brother brahm talks about that
[1:29:05] just for the sake of time i didn't put
[1:29:06] it all in here but he talks about
[1:29:08] there's built into a woman a need and a
[1:29:10] desire to nurture
[1:29:12] and he says what happens is we've got
[1:29:14] women now that for the sake of their
[1:29:15] bodies for the sake of their looks for
[1:29:17] sake of their their position in society
[1:29:19] they'll refuse to have children he says
[1:29:21] and so what they do is they get a little
[1:29:23] puppy or something and they put all of
[1:29:25] their nurturing into that so that they
[1:29:27] can express that thing that's inside of
[1:29:29] them but still get away with having the
[1:29:32] life that they want right
[1:29:34] he says what is it they're they're
[1:29:36] they're shortchanging themselves right
[1:29:39] they don't realize the blessing that
[1:29:40] they lost because of it and there's a
[1:29:42] there's a modern research now that's
[1:29:44] showing that a recent research that's
[1:29:46] showing that greater and greater numbers
[1:29:48] of women that have committed themselves
[1:29:49] to a career based on what what schools
[1:29:51] are telling what mainstream media is
[1:29:53] saying they're saying go into careers go
[1:29:54] into careers go into careers and they
[1:29:56] hit about the age of 35 and they realize
[1:29:58] i'm not fulfilled and some of them get
[1:30:00] to great positions of power and
[1:30:02] influence and they make great money and
[1:30:04] they have a big impact on society but
[1:30:06] they get there and they say this isn't
[1:30:08] working and they're 35 years old and now
[1:30:10] they're trying to find a husband
[1:30:12] and they can't compete with the 21 and
[1:30:14] 22 year olds that are saying up front i
[1:30:15] want to get married and so what happens
[1:30:17] is the majority of them are having
[1:30:19] marriages of convenience where they find
[1:30:21] a like-minded man that focused on his
[1:30:22] career or wasn't attractive enough or
[1:30:25] making enough money or whatever and
[1:30:26] they're joining up and they're getting
[1:30:28] into a marriage of convenience where
[1:30:29] they will purely have children and
[1:30:31] that's all it's about they know they
[1:30:33] don't love each other they're not
[1:30:34] particularly attracted to each other but
[1:30:36] she needs that man to fulfill the
[1:30:37] womanhood side of her the motherhood
[1:30:39] side of her and he wants that wife
[1:30:41] for the physical side of things and
[1:30:42] whatnot and so they basically make a
[1:30:44] contract that he'll supply what she
[1:30:46] needs if she'll supply what he needs and
[1:30:47] there's no love in the relationship why
[1:30:49] because they ignored up front what god
[1:30:51] had built into them to produce in their
[1:30:52] life amen
[1:30:55] brother braham said womanhood is the one
[1:30:57] of the things that holds our nation
[1:30:58] together it's the
[1:31:00] backbone but all's not well as we know
[1:31:03] we look around and we see nations are
[1:31:04] breaking and nations have fallen apart
[1:31:06] they've fallen apart a long time and he
[1:31:08] points to the issue of motherhood he
[1:31:09] says our womanhood is broke motherhood
[1:31:12] of america has crashed the morals is as
[1:31:14] rotten as anything as any nation in the
[1:31:16] world what's the matter it's because
[1:31:18] they have loved the things of the world
[1:31:20] more than they love god and they got
[1:31:22] perverted exactly right what is it
[1:31:24] something has changed their vision
[1:31:26] something has changed what they want and
[1:31:28] it's focused them on something that's
[1:31:29] off the word of god he says and it broke
[1:31:31] the nation now we know that it happened
[1:31:33] originally when they went into world war
[1:31:35] one and all the men left and all the
[1:31:36] women went into the factories and so you
[1:31:38] had less children being born then you
[1:31:40] went into world war ii and then the
[1:31:41] women really started to realize we can
[1:31:42] do this they're trying to rebuild a
[1:31:44] nation and so they're starting to put
[1:31:45] more and more women into the workforce
[1:31:47] and as they did that they pulled away
[1:31:49] what motherhood not just womanhood now
[1:31:51] but motherhood and he says it broke the
[1:31:53] nation because now you have strangers
[1:31:54] raising your children or you're not
[1:31:56] having any children it's not tempering
[1:31:58] your life it's not helping you grow and
[1:31:59] mature because it's her salvation if she
[1:32:02] does it and so all of a sudden we've got
[1:32:03] all these problems in the nation amen
[1:32:05] what is it we've got a world of dinks
[1:32:07] now do you guys know what dinks are
[1:32:09] dual income no kids right you have a
[1:32:12] husband and a wife and they're both
[1:32:13] working they're making tons of money
[1:32:15] they're having a great life they're
[1:32:16] going on 17 vacations a year to exotic
[1:32:18] places that they they put on facebook
[1:32:20] and instagram to tell everybody what a
[1:32:22] wonderful life they have and they never
[1:32:23] have any responsibility except to each
[1:32:25] other and they never have children
[1:32:26] because they enjoy a life of pleasure
[1:32:28] and ease and that's exactly what it is
[1:32:30] boy if you're both working you can have
[1:32:32] a good life in this world amen you don't
[1:32:34] have to make a ton each but if together
[1:32:36] you're working together you can make 150
[1:32:38] grand no problem every year and live a
[1:32:39] great life just about anywhere you know
[1:32:42] and what is it they get attached to that
[1:32:44] and so all of a sudden the family's put
[1:32:45] on hold and they never get around to it
[1:32:47] and they just grow old and fat and sassy
[1:32:49] and have a great life but braham says
[1:32:51] it's not what you're get it's not what
[1:32:52] marriage is about he says any woman that
[1:32:55] refuses a man his child has no right to
[1:32:57] be a wife to him amen you remember in
[1:32:59] the bible when the king married esther
[1:33:01] because the queen refused he just got
[1:33:02] him another one what happened when she
[1:33:04] refused to come out with the king and
[1:33:05] obey him the same thing it is with a
[1:33:07] woman that refuses to be a wife to her
[1:33:10] husband now we don't have that problem
[1:33:11] obviously all of our sisters have
[1:33:13] children here we're not seeing that sort
[1:33:14] of thing but what you'll see is
[1:33:16] literally in the real world they'll say
[1:33:17] i'll marry you but we aren't having
[1:33:19] children
[1:33:20] and i'm getting fixed or you're getting
[1:33:22] fixed or we're both getting fixed to
[1:33:23] make sure it doesn't happen and they
[1:33:24] refuse to have a child with that man he
[1:33:27] says you can't do it she hasn't er why
[1:33:30] why would you be a wife he says if you
[1:33:31] would if you would refuse that
[1:33:33] but i want to show the other side of
[1:33:34] this that's a that's a hard thing to
[1:33:36] kind of end on here but i want to show
[1:33:38] you the real power of motherhood when
[1:33:40] you have a real commitment to to your
[1:33:42] husband and to your children this is in
[1:33:44] questions and answers it says brother
[1:33:45] branham you said on one of the tapes
[1:33:47] that noah saved his household does that
[1:33:49] mean a mother can have the same faith
[1:33:51] for her household
[1:33:52] and does that mean every one of the
[1:33:54] family will be saved if we believe it he
[1:33:56] says you'd have to watch the way i
[1:33:58] answer this now see first you said one
[1:34:00] of your tapes that noah saved his
[1:34:01] household why because they believed
[1:34:03] that's it because they believed in his
[1:34:05] message
[1:34:07] does this mean that a mother can have
[1:34:08] the same faith for her household
[1:34:11] yes sister i see a little mother's heart
[1:34:13] crying for a people and does this mean
[1:34:15] every one of the family will be saved if
[1:34:17] we believe it he says yes if they will
[1:34:19] accept it that's right remember the
[1:34:21] philippian jailer believe for both if
[1:34:24] you've got faith for your own enough
[1:34:26] faith for your own salvation can't you
[1:34:28] have that same faith that'll work upon
[1:34:30] your people
[1:34:31] what is faith it's an unseen force see
[1:34:34] it's a spirit the holy spirits bring
[1:34:36] faith see it's an unseen forth therefore
[1:34:39] it is the spirit of the lord on you
[1:34:41] mothers
[1:34:42] it is the spirit of the lord and when
[1:34:44] you've got the spirit of the lord in you
[1:34:47] to believe for your own salvation place
[1:34:49] that upon your family say i claim them
[1:34:51] in the name of jesus christ i claim it
[1:34:54] god i don't know how you're going to
[1:34:55] make her do it and how you're going to
[1:34:57] make him do it but i believe it i
[1:34:59] believe it lord help my unbelief claim
[1:35:02] it and watch what happens
[1:35:05] that it'll do it amen
[1:35:08] a mother has a as a heart for her
[1:35:10] children in a way a father just doesn't
[1:35:13] right because it is literally out of her
[1:35:15] right it's something that she nurtures
[1:35:17] and carries and attack it's attached to
[1:35:19] her for so long she's got something that
[1:35:21] she can go with that just men don't seem
[1:35:23] to have that same thing and then we're
[1:35:25] great on the provision side and
[1:35:26] protection all these things but when it
[1:35:27] comes to to getting down and and really
[1:35:29] bringing them before the throne of grace
[1:35:31] and that a mother's prayer brother bram
[1:35:32] talks so often about a mother's prayer
[1:35:34] and the power of a mother's prayer not a
[1:35:36] father's prayer a mother's prayer why
[1:35:38] because it's part of her virtue that god
[1:35:41] has given her he's given her a sacred
[1:35:43] thing that can take them before the
[1:35:44] throne of god in a way that nobody else
[1:35:46] can amen that's a position of power
[1:35:48] sisters that you can go before the
[1:35:50] throne of grace and god hears your
[1:35:51] prayer in a special way
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:54] but there's a third thing that we saw
[1:35:57] and brother brahm says it's honoring
[1:35:58] your husband
[1:35:59] and we saw before it was keeping herself
[1:36:01] pure from outside influence or intimacy
[1:36:03] and in this one when we come to the
[1:36:05] natural it says she does not listen to
[1:36:07] any other man
[1:36:08] or follow her own personal thoughts or
[1:36:11] beliefs that's what it means to honor
[1:36:13] your husband it means to glorify and
[1:36:15] magnify him not yourself now that's a
[1:36:18] hard thing to do if you're always
[1:36:19] thinking about yourself
[1:36:22] right you've got to be looking to his
[1:36:23] vision you've got to be looking to your
[1:36:25] husband's purpose if i can put it that
[1:36:27] way god has a three-fold purpose the
[1:36:29] question is what is your husband's
[1:36:30] purpose now your sisters know us men are
[1:36:32] not known great for communication right
[1:36:35] not usually our strongest thing we don't
[1:36:36] like to sit down and talk for hours most
[1:36:38] of us some of us do
[1:36:40] right so what sometimes you have to
[1:36:42] determine what his vision is based on
[1:36:44] how he responds when you do certain
[1:36:45] things right you'll do a certain thing
[1:36:47] and all of a sudden your husband perks
[1:36:48] up he's like wow that was amazing that
[1:36:50] is so good and you're like
[1:36:53] you could have just asked me to do it
[1:36:55] i never thought to i didn't even know
[1:36:56] what i wanted sometimes us brothers
[1:36:58] right
[1:36:59] and the way it goes and then all of a
[1:37:00] sudden the wife does something right
[1:37:01] you're like wow i love you so much
[1:37:04] you always loved her she just got in
[1:37:06] line with a vision that you were
[1:37:07] unwilling to share you need to share
[1:37:08] that vision we can't blame our sisters
[1:37:11] or our wives if if they're not
[1:37:13] following through with what we want if
[1:37:14] we never tell them what we want if we're
[1:37:15] not clear in what we want what is our
[1:37:17] vision what is our purpose what is what
[1:37:19] is it that we want our money to be spent
[1:37:21] on what is it we want our energy to be
[1:37:22] spent on because otherwise they'll find
[1:37:24] all sorts of things to fill it but if
[1:37:25] it's not in line with the husband's will
[1:37:27] then you're going to have conflict
[1:37:28] inside the marriage so it's up to us as
[1:37:30] men to share what that purpose is for
[1:37:33] the marriage and for the family amen
[1:37:35] but that thing for for honoring him
[1:37:37] means that you don't based at you don't
[1:37:39] act based on what others think or
[1:37:41] believe or tell you
[1:37:43] that's the hardest thing sometimes and i
[1:37:45] remember my mom saying that she she
[1:37:47] tried very hard and she did well at it
[1:37:49] she said as soon as you got married i
[1:37:50] tried to back away
[1:37:52] so as not to try and influence you on
[1:37:54] what your marriage was going to be and
[1:37:56] how to do certain things if you asked
[1:37:57] that answer but she said i tried to pull
[1:37:58] away and let you do that why so that my
[1:38:01] wife and with my wife especially so that
[1:38:03] what she's not trying to influence my
[1:38:05] wife to go away without me saying that's
[1:38:07] the way i want to go
[1:38:08] right that's why the clear vision is
[1:38:10] required and now on the wife's side it's
[1:38:11] to close off her ears to every other bit
[1:38:13] of influence and say i'm sorry i have to
[1:38:16] stay with what my husband says and what
[1:38:17] he wants to be doing amen remember what
[1:38:20] brother branham said a prostitute was
[1:38:22] spreading your own stuff
[1:38:24] right so for honoring a woman it's when
[1:38:26] you're going around with your ideas and
[1:38:27] your thoughts and you're sharing that
[1:38:29] with everyone else and you're living
[1:38:30] that with everyone else and you're
[1:38:32] ignoring what your husband wants you to
[1:38:33] do
[1:38:34] he says that's a prostitute spirit
[1:38:35] that's doing that that's a hard thing to
[1:38:37] say and he says it makes you an
[1:38:38] unfaithful wife if you're focused on
[1:38:40] doing what you want and what you think
[1:38:42] is best rather than what your husband
[1:38:43] has asked you to do and of course the
[1:38:45] difficulty comes through
[1:38:47] when he says or says or wants you to do
[1:38:49] the wrong thing meaning that you
[1:38:51] disagree with his decision that's going
[1:38:53] to be the biggest struggle in a marriage
[1:38:54] is when a husband makes a decision and
[1:38:56] the wife doesn't agree with it and
[1:38:58] you've got to literally line up with
[1:39:00] that and move forward
[1:39:02] that doesn't mean you don't say i
[1:39:03] disagree with you and here's my reasons
[1:39:05] why and maybe you've got scriptures and
[1:39:06] quotes and all those things you're
[1:39:07] expected to do that if you feel he's off
[1:39:09] then you're supposed to do that but if
[1:39:11] he's going to move forward with the
[1:39:12] decision then you have to do that and
[1:39:14] you have to literally support him you do
[1:39:16] not undercut him right oh i don't like
[1:39:19] what john said you know block was go
[1:39:20] around saying yeah john did it i don't
[1:39:22] agree with it but i'm going to go with
[1:39:24] it no you don't even say i disagree with
[1:39:25] it you say that is my husband and i'm
[1:39:28] following my husband
[1:39:29] right you fight in the backyard and you
[1:39:31] agree in the front yard even if you know
[1:39:32] it's off
[1:39:34] that's the way we're supposed to do it
[1:39:35] and that's the the that's where the type
[1:39:37] is so difficult for sisters and for men
[1:39:39] alike is that we're in a fallen
[1:39:41] condition and we're trusting the holy
[1:39:43] spirit to lead and guide us but we still
[1:39:44] make wrong decisions we still get caught
[1:39:46] up in things we still get into things we
[1:39:48] shouldn't be into we make bad decisions
[1:39:50] go the wrong places go to the wrong
[1:39:51] church whatever the case may be we do
[1:39:53] wrong things all the time and the
[1:39:55] sisters have to sit there and bear that
[1:39:57] and suffer through it and trust that god
[1:39:59] will correct us quickly and in time and
[1:40:01] undo as much of that damages that's made
[1:40:03] as when we get there you know
[1:40:06] but i want to say this is that if the
[1:40:07] wife will do that it gives us tremendous
[1:40:09] insight into the husband because a wife
[1:40:11] that is fully submitted to her husband
[1:40:13] is the closest we'll ever get to a
[1:40:14] mirror for a man and you'll see far more
[1:40:16] through a man's wife than you often will
[1:40:18] through the man because she is a
[1:40:19] reflection of him if she's in submission
[1:40:21] and she's under that headshit so i
[1:40:23] wouldn't look at brother bob necessarily
[1:40:24] i'd look at sister brenda and say what
[1:40:26] does sister brenda put her time into
[1:40:28] because that's going to tell me what
[1:40:28] brother bob wants her to put it into
[1:40:30] same for sister leah right same for
[1:40:32] sister rebecca and these different ones
[1:40:33] we look at those women and we can see
[1:40:35] what does it matter to that husband
[1:40:36] because what she's putting her time into
[1:40:38] is what he's authorized her to do if
[1:40:39] she's in submission she's under head
[1:40:41] amen
[1:40:44] brother brown says this
[1:40:47] this is why
[1:40:48] i say to the sisters
[1:40:50] that you don't protect yourself in these
[1:40:52] cases you can't you have to let god do
[1:40:53] the protecting you stay in your position
[1:40:55] so that god can protect you so that god
[1:40:57] can answer the situation through your
[1:40:59] husband and with your husband directly
[1:41:01] and sometimes you're trying to keep him
[1:41:02] from getting hurt
[1:41:03] right they're not doing it always for
[1:41:05] selfish reasons sometimes they're saying
[1:41:06] honey this is going to hurt you don't do
[1:41:09] it and we do it anyways and we've got to
[1:41:10] be able to step back and say all right
[1:41:12] you get to make the call but watch this
[1:41:14] and here's the reason why sisters he
[1:41:16] says let me get this in right good now
[1:41:18] so you can see it a woman is subject to
[1:41:20] her husband the bible says a man should
[1:41:22] rule over his wife but how they've
[1:41:24] changed that the woman rules over the
[1:41:26] man now listen to what he says here now
[1:41:28] you stay home john you're not going now
[1:41:31] that could mean anything
[1:41:32] that could mean he's going to a bar
[1:41:34] that could mean he's going out for a
[1:41:35] guy's night out it could mean he's going
[1:41:37] out to play sports it could mean that
[1:41:38] he's staying late at work
[1:41:40] it could mean anything and he's saying
[1:41:41] the woman saying you don't go out
[1:41:44] he says she's not allowed to say that
[1:41:45] she shouldn't say that he says and that
[1:41:46] settles it yes my dear what is it the
[1:41:49] husband is whipped the woman is having
[1:41:50] control over the husband
[1:41:53] remember
[1:41:54] remember what we said about
[1:41:56] brian talk about the women going on a
[1:41:57] rampage if you threaten your husband to
[1:41:59] not do something you're on a rampage
[1:42:03] right because it falls to him to make
[1:42:05] the leadership decisions and you don't
[1:42:06] threaten him with something if he
[1:42:08] doesn't do what you want him to do
[1:42:09] that's taking that usurping authority
[1:42:11] over your husband
[1:42:12] okay
[1:42:16] he says but let me tell you something
[1:42:18] mister you're gonna have to answer for
[1:42:20] your wife but your wife is never going
[1:42:22] to have to answer for you
[1:42:24] you are the head of the woman and god is
[1:42:25] the head of the man so sisters when you
[1:42:27] change that man's mind
[1:42:29] guess what you're stepping into his
[1:42:31] position but you never have to answer
[1:42:32] for it
[1:42:33] he answers for it because he let you do
[1:42:35] it and so you're actually putting him
[1:42:37] even if you're getting him to do the
[1:42:38] right thing if you're forcing him to do
[1:42:40] the right thing you're still out of your
[1:42:41] position it's the right reason wrong
[1:42:43] action you can't do it because he
[1:42:45] answers for the family not you you
[1:42:48] answer for did you give your input
[1:42:50] and if you did but you're not supposed
[1:42:51] to force it amen
[1:42:53] now if you believe this sisters you'll
[1:42:56] have rest even when you disagree that
[1:42:58] what he's going to answer for and so
[1:43:00] often we're motivated by love and
[1:43:01] concern and i understand that but often
[1:43:03] we're also motivated all of us by
[1:43:06] selfishness because it makes my life
[1:43:07] easier and i don't want to go through
[1:43:08] this and i don't want to go through that
[1:43:10] and that's where we really have to watch
[1:43:11] out is when we're looking up for
[1:43:12] ourselves rather than for the other
[1:43:14] person and that's the challenge for us
[1:43:15] as men is are we making decisions for
[1:43:17] the family based on what's easier for us
[1:43:20] as men as husbands as fathers are we
[1:43:22] making it for the good of the family and
[1:43:24] we talked about that with the brothers
[1:43:25] as we're supposed to be self-sacrificial
[1:43:27] in nature and that's what we do as
[1:43:29] christ did we do what's good for the
[1:43:31] others not just what's good for
[1:43:32] ourselves and that's what allow our
[1:43:33] wives to start to trust us more amen if
[1:43:35] we've got conflict in the in the
[1:43:37] marriage and in the family based on
[1:43:39] headship issues it's usually because the
[1:43:40] wife doesn't trust the husband because
[1:43:42] his track record isn't very good amen
[1:43:45] right once you start to get on the right
[1:43:47] path and once you start to make
[1:43:48] consistent word-based decisions you'll
[1:43:50] find that wife is so much happier to let
[1:43:52] you make the decisions but it's when
[1:43:53] you're fighting back and forth and she
[1:43:55] sees he's going into selfishness he's
[1:43:56] going into money he's going into this
[1:43:58] he's going to no no you got to stick
[1:44:00] with the word and make word-based
[1:44:01] decisions and that'll give your wife a
[1:44:03] fighting chance to submit to you a
[1:44:04] little more easily amen we want to set
[1:44:06] them up we want to set our wives up for
[1:44:08] success by what making sure we're right
[1:44:11] so we give them a chance to be right but
[1:44:13] the challenge in the test for the
[1:44:14] sisters is when he's wrong what will you
[1:44:16] do
[1:44:17] amen will you submit honor your husband
[1:44:19] means to do what he asks you to do even
[1:44:22] if you disagree with it now you don't
[1:44:23] ever go off the word brother adam is 100
[1:44:26] clear on that right
[1:44:28] you don't get to you don't get to to
[1:44:30] just say well he's my husband i'll do
[1:44:31] anything no no your husband wants you to
[1:44:33] dress inappropriately he wants you to
[1:44:35] watch things you shouldn't watch if he
[1:44:36] wants you to do things you shouldn't do
[1:44:38] no sir you have the right to say i'm
[1:44:39] sorry i respect you and i love you but i
[1:44:42] don't have to do that because the word
[1:44:43] says i shouldn't do that everything else
[1:44:46] yes sir you have to do it day-to-day
[1:44:47] life all those things that belongs to
[1:44:48] him but you never go against the word
[1:44:50] but you better make sure it's the word
[1:44:51] and not just you as well
[1:44:53] amen
[1:44:54] true womanhood a beautiful type of the
[1:44:57] bride of christ with sacred virtues
[1:44:59] sacred trust to guard and cherish and to
[1:45:01] hold before god and your husband all of
[1:45:03] your life amen the backbone of a nation
[1:45:05] the fifth gospel
[1:45:07] true women the fifth gospel i've said it
[1:45:09] before i'll say it again he never calls
[1:45:11] men the fifth gospel he calls women the
[1:45:13] fifth gospel when they're in their place
[1:45:15] amen
[1:45:16] a beauty and a purity as he said that
[1:45:18] the world can never understand and can
[1:45:19] never attain because they've already
[1:45:21] given themselves to multiple men
[1:45:23] multiple influences multiple ideas all
[1:45:25] these different things amen but you have
[1:45:27] a special place of honor love trust
[1:45:30] beauty rest graciousness and
[1:45:33] glorification that even us men don't get
[1:45:35] to experience in the same way it's an
[1:45:37] amazing thing if you can come to that
[1:45:38] place of trust and rest like sarah did
[1:45:40] amen
[1:45:41] let's stand up if we would ask our
[1:45:43] musician to come forward
[1:45:49] now we're preaching
[1:45:51] anytime we talk about the sisters like
[1:45:52] we said before it applies to men as the
[1:45:54] bride of christ but
[1:45:56] we're asking the sisters to live out a
[1:45:58] type of the bride of christ
[1:45:59] and knowing that us brothers are called
[1:46:01] to be a type of christ they're the bride
[1:46:03] we're christ and how often we fail how
[1:46:06] gracious are we to be to our sisters
[1:46:07] amen that where they fall short where we
[1:46:10] think they fall short at least that we'd
[1:46:12] be gracious that we'd be as
[1:46:13] long-suffering as they often have to be
[1:46:15] with us amen
[1:46:17] amen that as our imperfection would
[1:46:19] cause us to go to the throne of grace
[1:46:21] and ask forgiveness and ask for god's
[1:46:22] longsuffering we ought to have the same
[1:46:24] thing that god would help them to grow
[1:46:26] and as he causes them to grow we'd be
[1:46:28] gracious that we would help them to meet
[1:46:30] that type that they're called to amen i
[1:46:32] mean god bless you let's just bow our
[1:46:33] heads this morning
[1:46:35] heavenly father
[1:46:37] lord you've given each one of us a place
[1:46:39] a purpose a role responsibilities lord
[1:46:42] but our sisters have a special place as
[1:46:44] we've read this morning lord you've
[1:46:46] elevated them above lord so that the
[1:46:48] world can see each one of them in a
[1:46:50] special place or to see how they've been
[1:46:52] set aside for your glory and for your
[1:46:54] honor heavenly father and lord it's a
[1:46:56] difficult road though nor believer gets
[1:46:59] away lord with a life of ease lord but
[1:47:02] they have a special battle that they
[1:47:03] face these days is it's a woman's nation

[1:47:07] directions get them off the word of god
[1:47:10] lord get them into their own leadership
[1:47:11] and headship
[1:47:13] lord we pray that they would see the
[1:47:14] beauty that you've given them in the
[1:47:16] word heavenly father they would rest and
[1:47:18] trust lord that as they're in their
[1:47:20] marriages as they're in their
[1:47:21] relationships lord that they would grow
[1:47:23] that they would learn to trust you lord
[1:47:24] that you do all things well lord that
[1:47:26] you bring all things about for their
[1:47:28] good
[1:47:28] and lord that you'll take them all the
[1:47:30] way to a perfect end we pray lord as
[1:47:32] brothers lord may you help us in our
[1:47:34] leadership lord god lord that we would
[1:47:36] be humble in it lord that we would not
[1:47:38] be cocky or arrogant or think that we
[1:47:40] always do things right but lord that our
[1:47:42] humility would keep us lord in a place
[1:47:44] where we would be as gracious to them as
[1:47:46] we expect you to be with us lord bless
