[45:00] He's in the house.
[45:05] Little girl was lying there. The people
[45:09] all were weeping.
[45:13] They just laughed at Jesus.
[45:16] He said, "She's only sleeping."
[45:20] As he took her by the hand, she began to
[45:25] live again.
[45:27] Some began to praise the Lord. Some
[45:31] began to say,
[45:34] "He's in the house.
[45:38] Death has to flee. Thank you, Lord.
[45:42] Glory.

[48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to slow anything
[48:10] down, but just want to greet each one
[48:12] that's here. We want to greet brother
[48:14] Emanuel here. Amen. God bless you,
[48:16] brother. Good to see you. Sister Karen

[49:27] still.
[49:30] Oh, empty and bare.
[49:34] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.

[50:28] empty and bare
[50:31] Lord hear my prayer
[50:35] more of you.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Good to be in God's
[50:42] house. Good to see all of you again.
[50:44] Good to see Sister Sandy and each and
[50:47] every one of you. May the Lord richly
[50:48] bless you today. Didn't expect to be
[50:50] here, but always uh an honor to speak to
[50:53] God's people. Let's pray. Heavenly
[50:56] Father, we are so thankful, Lord, for
[50:58] your many blessings. And we often say
[51:01] that and use that phrase, but Lord, we
[51:03] never ever want to take for granted how
[51:05] attended you are in our lives and how
[51:09] how close you can be to know our
[51:12] thoughts and to know our fears and to
[51:14] know our concerns.
[51:16] Not only that, Lord, but for us to have
[51:18] the right and the privilege to be able
[51:20] to come to you and cast our cares upon
[51:22] you because you care for us.
[51:25] We are blessed, Lord, to be in your
[51:27] presence today, in the presence of your
[51:29] people. We ask now that you would
[51:31] forgive us of anything, anything at all
[51:33] that might hinder the moving of the Holy
[51:34] Spirit. And Lord, just have your way
[51:36] among us today. Speak to us, fill our
[51:39] cups, heal those that need to be healed,
[51:43] and Lord, we'll commit our time here
[51:44] into your hands today in Jesus lovely
[51:47] name. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord.
[51:51] Well, while you're standing, let's take
[51:53] your Bibles and let's go right to the
[51:54] word this morning in 1 Corinthians
[51:56] chapter 15. Thank you, musicians.
[51:58] And uh appreciate your contribution
[52:02] today.
[52:06] Let's look in 1 Corinthians chapter 15.
[52:08] This I think will not be
[52:13] new or innovative for any of you. This
[52:16] is uh
[52:19] some these are some basic principles
[52:21] that I just felt on my heart to cover uh
[52:24] today. And we'll title this rapturing
[52:26] faith. And uh let's just jump right in
[52:28] if that's all right. I don't need to
[52:30] make any introductions or anything. I
[52:32] think we're good. 1 Corinthians chapter
[52:34] 15 and let's look at verse 51. Behold, I
[52:39] show you a mystery. We shall not all
[52:41] sleep, but we shall all be changed in a
[52:45] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
[52:48] the last trump. For the trumpet shall
[52:50] sound, and the dead in Christ shall be
[52:54] and the dead shall be raised
[52:55] incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
[52:59] May the Lord at his blessing, you may be
[53:01] seated.
[53:06] It's always nice to come to New
[53:07] Foundland and uh be here with you all in
[53:10] the beautiful weather that you have here
[53:12] and it's the only reason that we come
[53:16] and uh be able to see the beauty of your
[53:20] country and and uh see everyone's
[53:23] smiling faces. We appreciate that. We
[53:25] have a very very unique event uh tonight
[53:28] with our family and it'll be the because
[53:31] it is our family. We only do this once
[53:33] every 50 years or so and that is to have
[53:36] a reunion. Uh so it'll be really
[53:39] interesting uh to to be able to do that
[53:42] uh this this uh on this trip and uh so I
[53:46] was we were really delighted to be able
[53:48] to come during this particular time and
[53:51] um be able to spend a little uh just a
[53:55] few days here with you and uh get some
[53:57] blueberries and then back on the back on
[54:00] the journey again.
[54:02] And you may not think that blueberries
[54:04] are very special, but u when you live in
[54:06] the US of A, blueberries are special.
[54:10] So let's let's take a look uh at this
[54:13] subject here today. And I I don't want
[54:15] to uh preamble very much at all. Uh and
[54:19] I'll explain my point here as we jump
[54:23] into this uh this morning. And uh just
[54:26] follow me here. The first I've got a
[54:28] little reading that I want to do and
[54:29] then we'll get graphic uh with some
[54:32] things and then ask some good questions
[54:34] here because we're coming down to the
[54:37] end of things. As brother Brandham says
[54:38] in this quotation right here, uh he
[54:41] says, remember these words, everything's
[54:44] at the end. We're the generation upon
[54:47] whom the ends of the world have come. We
[54:50] are that generation. And God said, "I'm
[54:51] going to a lot different people for
[54:54] different uh seasons, but this is the
[54:56] group that God said, we're going to
[54:58] place you at the end." And and you are
[55:01] the people that are going to cross the
[55:02] finish line and civilization's at its
[55:04] end. Democracy is at its end. Everything
[55:06] you we don't need to belabor the point.
[55:08] But he said, "We've got to come to this
[55:10] place. We're here. We're at the end." So
[55:11] here, as I mentioned to you before,
[55:13] prophets orient us. They tell us where
[55:16] we are in the timeline. They tell us
[55:18] where we are in terms of the whole
[55:21] scheme of things, the whole plan of God.
[55:23] Prophets are good at that because they
[55:24] know exactly where we are. Martin Luther
[55:27] said one time in the 1500s, we're at the
[55:29] end time. We must be. And he alluded to
[55:31] the fact that he thought he might even
[55:32] be Malachi 4. He might be the person to
[55:35] fulfill that. I've got a I've got that
[55:36] one of my books about Martin Luther. And
[55:39] you know, in in a in a he was close, but
[55:41] he was not he was not right. He was not
[55:43] a prophet. and he had an idea that his
[55:47] work was truly one of being a a a work
[55:50] of restoration because he felt like he
[55:52] was going to reform the Catholic Church
[55:53] and turn it around and everything would
[55:55] be great. It didn't work. And uh but yet
[55:58] he thought maybe we're at that season,
[56:00] but here comes a prophet in the end and
[56:02] says, "No, here's exactly where we are.
[56:04] This is this age began here, ended
[56:07] there. This is the messenger. And this
[56:10] is the next age. This is where it began.
[56:11] This is where it ended. This is the
[56:13] messenger." You can only have that true
[56:15] perspective from the top of a pyramid.
[56:19] Right? When you're on any side of the
[56:20] pyramid, you can't see the other sides.
[56:22] I've been there. I've seen the pyramids.
[56:25] But but when you're at the top, you can
[56:27] see all the sides. So, you can see when
[56:29] all the ages began, who was the lead
[56:32] person in that age and when it ended and
[56:34] when the next transition came. So, all
[56:37] of that uh are are are things that
[56:39] brother Brandham alerted us to. Then he
[56:41] asks the question, this is his this is
[56:44] his thinking out loud. This is serves as
[56:46] this a time really important sermon
[56:48] because he's coming into he's on the
[56:51] doorstep of the third pull, right? He's
[56:54] coming into this season now where he
[56:57] knows there's got to be more, but he's
[56:59] unclear as to exactly how that's going
[57:02] to unfold. He doesn't really know what
[57:05] shape that's going to take uh what shape
[57:07] that's going to take as he goes forward.
[57:10] And and he's he's asking these questions
[57:12] out loud. It's great. He says, "Where
[57:14] are we at? The other angels was
[57:16] messengers like Martin Luther and
[57:17] Wesley, men of the earth, the angel of
[57:19] the church of Le ofia, messengers,
[57:21] prophets to the church. But this one,
[57:23] and he's referring to Revelation 10:1.
[57:26] This one didn't come from the earth." So
[57:30] this is one that came down, one that
[57:32] came through. And it came from heaven
[57:34] because the mystery is all finished. And
[57:36] he said, "What if? What if this is
[57:40] something to let us know how to enter
[57:42] into rapturing faith?
[57:44] What if this is that? What if we really
[57:47] are there and it's so close that I'll
[57:49] see it and in this is this a generation
[57:51] and sers is is this a time? Is this
[57:54] where we actually are? And so this these
[57:57] are the questions that he's asking here
[57:59] and they're all very good questions.
[58:03] And he's asking them because he realizes
[58:06] we are truly in the harvest time.
[58:11] He's recognizing no other age did they
[58:13] say this or allude to this, but he
[58:15] realizes we're at the end time. And this
[58:17] is the time uh to reap. This is not a
[58:20] sewing time. This is a reaping time,
[58:22] right? This is a time when we're going
[58:23] to gather in. This is John 13 fulfilled.
[58:27] And Jesus, you know, they come to uh in
[58:29] the parable, they came to the master and
[58:31] they said, "Hey, there's weeds in the
[58:32] field. There's good so seed sown, but
[58:34] there's weeds in the field." He said,
[58:36] "Let them let them both grow. Let them
[58:37] alone. Let them both grow until the
[58:39] harvest." And in the harvest, it'll all
[58:41] be manifest what these seeds really are
[58:43] of, what kind of seeds they are. That's
[58:46] when you tell what seeds have been sewn
[58:48] is at the harvest. Right? In the growing
[58:50] cycle, it can the plants can impersonate
[58:52] one another, but at the harvest, we all
[58:54] know what everything is.
[58:58] Look, folks, we're going to we're going
[59:00] to see the real you before this is over,
[59:03] &gt;&gt; right? The real you is going to show
[59:05] show him herself or herself before this
[59:07] is over. And you're not going to be able
[59:08] to impersonate that because that's what
[59:10] that's what the principle of the harvest
[59:11] is,
[59:12] &gt;&gt; right? And and so therefore, Jesus said,
[59:14] "Let let them both grow together." And
[59:16] he said, "At the harvest time, we'll
[59:18] gather in and we'll gather out. There'll
[59:20] be an in gathering and an out
[59:21] gathering." and and that's that will
[59:23] that will come during this time of
[59:25] separation. Now, give me a minute here
[59:27] as I'd like to talk a little bit about
[59:28] this harvest season if that's all right.
[59:30] James tells us he said, "Be patient,
[59:33] therefore, uh, brethren, until the
[59:36] coming of the Lord. Behold, the
[59:38] husbandman waitth for the precious fruit
[59:39] of the earth and has long patience for
[59:42] it until he receiveth the early and the
[59:43] latter reign." How many of you would
[59:45] agree that we're living in that hour?
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Right? This is the season that James is
[59:50] talking about here, the coming of the
[59:51] Lord, the second coming of Christ. And
[59:53] so, be also patient and establish your
[59:56] hearts. This is what you need to do. You
[59:58] need to be patient and establish your
[1:00:00] hearts for the coming of the Lord drawth
[1:00:01] nigh. This is the time in this harvest
[1:00:04] season when there when there's a an
[1:00:06] actual in gathering uh taking place that
[1:00:09] the Lord will appear. He'll come and
[1:00:11] he'll take his bride away. Right? Are we
[1:00:14] okay with that? Everybody all right? I
[1:00:16] try to keep false doctrine down to a
[1:00:18] minimum when I travel. So you don't need
[1:00:20] to be too much on guard. All right.
[1:00:23] But now let's just let's just flesh this
[1:00:27] out a little bit here. Brother man tells
[1:00:28] us we know that this book of redemption
[1:00:31] will be I got to read just a little bit
[1:00:33] here. We get till we get going. We we
[1:00:36] know this book of redemption will be
[1:00:38] probed at through six ages. But at the
[1:00:41] end the seventh angel begins to sound.
[1:00:44] He winds up all the loose ends that they
[1:00:46] probed at. And the mysteries come down
[1:00:49] from God as the word of God. That's
[1:00:52] quite a statement. The mysteries come
[1:00:54] down from God as the word of God and
[1:00:57] reveals the entire revelation of God.
[1:00:59] That's pretty amazing. I mean, and I've
[1:01:02] said this many times before, either he's
[1:01:03] really right or he's really wrong.
[1:01:06] The revelation of the word in the last
[1:01:08] day comes to us as the word of God and
[1:01:11] reveals the entirety of God. I mean it
[1:01:13] reveals the the revelation of God, all
[1:01:15] the things that were probed at. So there
[1:01:17] were suppositions made. There were there
[1:01:19] were uh there were theories that were
[1:01:22] put forth all through the ages. And I'm
[1:01:24] not saying that in a bad way or a
[1:01:25] critical way. There were very
[1:01:27] intelligent and spiritual men who came
[1:01:29] before us who really wanted to know what
[1:01:31] the truth was and put out their theories
[1:01:34] and their ideas. And they did it in part
[1:01:37] because they only knew in part. They
[1:01:39] were doing their very best to come to
[1:01:41] the conclusions we've been given.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; I said they were they were very sincere
[1:01:47] in coming up with conclusions that we've
[1:01:49] been giving. We've been given truth.
[1:01:53] We've been given an understanding. We've
[1:01:54] been given loose ends put together where
[1:01:57] they belong. We've been given all of
[1:02:00] that because we live in this end time.
[1:02:02] And that was what was prophesied to
[1:02:03] happen. And then all the mysteries,
[1:02:05] godhead, serpent seed, you know, uh,
[1:02:07] predestination, the rapture, all of
[1:02:10] these things are all, uh, to be
[1:02:12] revealed, or all to be made known to
[1:02:13] who?
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; God chose you.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Be living at the end time when all of
[1:02:19] that would happen. Right now, let's
[1:02:23] let's keep at this for a minute here.
[1:02:25] And I I I I I dealt with this harvest
[1:02:28] principle. So, just let me uh let me
[1:02:31] share a little bit. Now, in the in the
[1:02:33] in the growing uh process and and in the
[1:02:37] natural types that brother Brandham took
[1:02:38] and he likened the bride to a wheat
[1:02:40] plant that grew uh from seed all the way
[1:02:43] to seed, right? You're familiar with
[1:02:46] that process. And and he said, now the
[1:02:49] stalk, he said, it doesn't look anything
[1:02:51] like the seed, neither the tassel or the
[1:02:53] leaves, they don't look like the seed
[1:02:55] that actually went in the ground. uh it
[1:02:58] it's it's it's quite to look at it in
[1:03:01] the appearance it's quite different. So,
[1:03:02] you have a little seed, you know, that
[1:03:04] looks like this and you put it in the
[1:03:06] ground and and it already knows what to
[1:03:08] do, right? That seed, you don't need you
[1:03:11] don't need to coach a seed. You don't
[1:03:14] need to give a ste seed a 12step
[1:03:16] program. Uh you don't need to
[1:03:18] indoctrinate a seed. You just put that
[1:03:20] seed in the right environment. Let it
[1:03:22] sit in the light. Let it get moisture,
[1:03:24] keep the weeds out, fertilize it in the
[1:03:26] right way, and it knows what to do. It
[1:03:28] knows what to become. it already is
[1:03:31] designed or predestinated to become
[1:03:33] something and uh it it's not going to
[1:03:36] turn out anything different because it's
[1:03:38] it's ordained to be a certain thing. And
[1:03:40] brother Brandham says in that growing
[1:03:42] process the parts of that plant that
[1:03:45] carry that life through to the end don't
[1:03:47] look like the seed. The first thing
[1:03:49] comes forth you'd almost think it was a
[1:03:51] seed but it's the hus. So at the end the
[1:03:53] first thing that comes forth he said
[1:03:55] you'd almost think it was a seed but he
[1:03:57] said in the end those uh he says uh the
[1:04:01] first thing comes forth you'd almost
[1:04:02] think it was a seed
[1:04:08] but it's the husk a little outside thing
[1:04:11] to hold the seed.
[1:04:14] You'd think it was the seed because it
[1:04:16] kind of looks like it but he said it's
[1:04:17] really not. It's the thing that holds
[1:04:19] the seed. It's a carrier of the life of
[1:04:22] corn of wheat. Now, let me say it's
[1:04:24] necessary because any part of that plant
[1:04:27] is necessary to get the life to where it
[1:04:29] needs to be, right? You have to have
[1:04:33] leaves, you have to have stalk, you have
[1:04:34] to have tassel, you have to have the
[1:04:36] husk, you have to have all those parts.
[1:04:37] But those parts are not the seed. They
[1:04:40] are the carriers of the life to get to
[1:04:43] that seed.
[1:04:45] So after Wesley put forth the husk which
[1:04:48] is most like the grain and you know then
[1:04:51] Luther and so or sorry Wesley and the
[1:04:53] Pentecostals and so forth and and that's
[1:04:56] what that's what follows. Now
[1:05:00] let let's let's look at the picture
[1:05:01] because this is uh I think pictures
[1:05:05] always make it a little clearer. It's
[1:05:07] coming same quote here. Now brother Bam
[1:05:09] said it's coming more like the grain all
[1:05:11] the time. It's it's coming to look like
[1:05:13] what went in the ground, the one that
[1:05:14] went in the ground. And when it comes
[1:05:16] forth, the stalk, it's got life in it,
[1:05:18] but it sure isn't the grain. So that's
[1:05:20] why it's not harvested at that point.
[1:05:24] Because even though it has life in it,
[1:05:26] it's not what the husbandman is after.
[1:05:29] It's not what the planter is after. He's
[1:05:31] not after stalk and he's not after husk
[1:05:34] and he's not after leaves. He's not
[1:05:36] after any of that. He's looking for the
[1:05:38] real true grain that he planted in the
[1:05:41] first place, right? That's what the
[1:05:43] husbandman's looking for. And he said
[1:05:45] it's just in the shape of the wheat,
[1:05:47] exactly like the grain of wheat, but yet
[1:05:49] it is in the wheat. And he's talking
[1:05:50] about this husk. And the Pentecostals
[1:05:52] come out just like the wheat would. So
[1:05:54] when you look at the drawing on the left
[1:05:56] there, these are grains on the bottom
[1:05:58] part. These are grains uh that are uh on
[1:06:01] the on the vine there and on the plant.
[1:06:04] And they look like wheat seed. They look
[1:06:06] like what went in the ground, but
[1:06:07] they're not. That's a that's a covering.
[1:06:10] That's a a husk is the way brother
[1:06:13] Brandon referred to it. And uh it it it
[1:06:16] is it is a container of the life. It's a
[1:06:18] carrier of the life, but it's not the
[1:06:19] wheat. It's it's not what not what the
[1:06:22] the husbandman's looking for. I remember
[1:06:25] years ago, Brother Lonnie Jenkins used
[1:06:26] to tell a story about how he was
[1:06:28] visiting u a pastor out west, and I know
[1:06:31] who the pastor was, and he had a grain
[1:06:33] field, a wheat field out in the west, in
[1:06:35] the big ones out there. And he said that
[1:06:38] uh when it came time for the harvest,
[1:06:41] they were in the season of the harvest,
[1:06:43] but he'd send his son out every morning,
[1:06:45] and he would come back with a handful of
[1:06:47] sheav of grain. And the farmer would
[1:06:50] take take him every every morning and
[1:06:52] he'd take his thumbnail like that and
[1:06:54] he'd press into the the husk and see if
[1:06:57] he could make a mark. And and if he
[1:07:00] could dent it, there was still moisture
[1:07:02] in there. And he would say, "Not quite
[1:07:05] ready." And then one morning, Brother
[1:07:07] Lonnie said he put his fingernail on
[1:07:10] that on a new one and he could not make
[1:07:12] a dent. It was completely dried out and
[1:07:14] it was it was hard. And he said, "Son,
[1:07:17] go fire up the combine. harvest. He said
[1:07:20] it's time time to gather it in because
[1:07:22] all the moisture was gone and it had
[1:07:23] matured and it had come to the place
[1:07:25] where uh it needed to be. So let's let's
[1:07:28] look at it a little closer.
[1:07:30] Now there's a point to this. So watch me
[1:07:33] here. So this is a drawing of the of a
[1:07:36] grain of wheat. All right? And and this
[1:07:38] is not proportional, but this is all the
[1:07:41] parts of the uh of the grain of wheat.
[1:07:44] As a matter of fact, I'll give you
[1:07:45] another uh
[1:07:48] give you another. No, sorry. That's a
[1:07:50] backwards drawing.
[1:07:53] Let's do another. Here's another. That's
[1:07:54] a little bit of a blow up there. So, now
[1:07:56] with with science and graphic artistry,
[1:07:58] we can uh blow up all of these pieces
[1:08:01] and so forth. So, these are all the the
[1:08:02] endosperm and the bran and all the rest
[1:08:05] of it, the hairs and the bracks and all
[1:08:07] the different parts of the wheat. And
[1:08:09] it's all used for different purposes.
[1:08:11] it's all uh mil and turned into
[1:08:13] different things and and that's that's
[1:08:15] the breakdown of a grain of wheat. So
[1:08:17] scientifically when you look at it uh
[1:08:20] that's that's the composition.
[1:08:23] Now according to the Bible,
[1:08:25] the the husbandman is looking for one
[1:08:28] thing and one thing only. And all those
[1:08:31] parts are necessary. All those parts are
[1:08:33] good, but he's only looking for one
[1:08:36] thing.
[1:08:38] And that one thing is that germ.
[1:08:42] Now, Brother Bam said each one comes out
[1:08:44] from the other, but they're only a
[1:08:45] carrier. And they go to denomination. In
[1:08:48] other words, they fade out. And that's
[1:08:50] what Pentecost did. So you know he's
[1:08:52] running the type and just like the grain
[1:08:54] it went back to one of those sister
[1:08:57] denominations. So all all of the parts
[1:09:00] of it they're all used in a different
[1:09:02] way but you know what you know what the
[1:09:04] husband men's after and I don't I don't
[1:09:06] know uh whether I can do it here but on
[1:09:08] the very bottom of the drawing here it
[1:09:10] says the germ. Now it's not in
[1:09:12] proportion here. It's not a proportional
[1:09:14] drawing because it would be too small.
[1:09:16] The fine print there says it makes up 3%
[1:09:19] of the kernel.
[1:09:22] So inside of that grain of wheat that
[1:09:25] that oblong thing is a grain of wheat.
[1:09:28] Inside of that is a little spot and it's
[1:09:33] called the germ and it only makes up 3%
[1:09:37] of the size of the whole grain of wheat.
[1:09:40] Now the grain of wheat's just a little
[1:09:41] small thing and a 3% speck inside of
[1:09:46] that is that germ of life. And I can
[1:09:49] tell you that's what the husbandman is
[1:09:52] looking for.
[1:09:54] Run your types. Now's the time to run
[1:09:57] your types
[1:09:59] because that's exactly what what Christ
[1:10:02] is looking for. That's what's got to be
[1:10:05] there. And it may not look most of you
[1:10:08] is what your parents produced,
[1:10:11] right? Some of us have an overabundance
[1:10:12] of what our parents produced. But inside
[1:10:15] of you, there's something there that
[1:10:17] when God looks at you, you know what he
[1:10:19] looks at? That's what he sees.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter whether it's 1% or
[1:10:25] 50% or 75%. He's looking for that life
[1:10:28] that's on the inside that comes from the
[1:10:31] original seed that was planted. And if
[1:10:33] you've got a part of that, you know what
[1:10:35] you've got? You got a part of God that
[1:10:37] lives inside of you.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; You have the life of almighty God living
[1:10:41] inside of you. And that, my friend, is
[1:10:43] eternal. And that's what he's looking
[1:10:45] for. As it doesn't matter whether you
[1:10:47] have a big percentage or a small
[1:10:49] percentage. If you have that life in
[1:10:51] you, that is actually the life of God.
[1:10:56] You ought to say, "Thank you, Jesus."
[1:10:59] That's something you can't impersonate.
[1:11:01] That's something that you can't buy.
[1:11:03] That's something that you can't learn.
[1:11:04] That's something that you can't get by
[1:11:06] being in church for a long time. You're
[1:11:08] born with it. It is eternal life. And if
[1:11:11] you have it, glory to God, you can't
[1:11:12] lose it.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Because if you are, if you have eternal
[1:11:17] life, it never did begin on a certain
[1:11:19] day. It didn't begin at an altar. It
[1:11:21] didn't begin at a camp meeting. If you
[1:11:22] have eternal life, you always did have
[1:11:24] eternal life. And you always will have
[1:11:26] eternal life. Do you believe that?
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; It's the most permanent thing there is
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; is the eternal.
[1:11:36] It's a beautiful thing.
[1:11:38] It is God's own life manifested on the
[1:11:41] inside. It is a wonderful, wonderful
[1:11:43] thing. I remember one time I was in
[1:11:46] Dubai and uh I was holding services over
[1:11:49] there and in Dubai things are very
[1:11:50] strict and very controlled and uh I was
[1:11:53] holding a meeting. They have a actually
[1:11:55] a walled compound which is about as big
[1:11:58] as your property here and they uh they
[1:12:01] have rooms in there that are like maybe
[1:12:04] a uh you know a section of your church
[1:12:06] here. small rooms and have a little
[1:12:07] pulpit and uh maybe some instruments and
[1:12:11] they allowed Christian groups to hold
[1:12:13] church service in there and you couldn't
[1:12:15] hold them out on the street. You
[1:12:16] couldn't hold them in a building out in
[1:12:18] public. it had to be in there and uh so
[1:12:21] the believers over there they invited me
[1:12:23] to come and speak and I spoke there many
[1:12:25] times and uh we would be in the in the
[1:12:28] room and they'd invite all the believers
[1:12:30] or people curious about the message and
[1:12:32] they would come to this uh meeting say
[1:12:34] on a Friday night and uh we would uh I'd
[1:12:38] minister to them and preach the message
[1:12:39] you know and do this and and uh they
[1:12:42] they'd all be uh listening and and a lot
[1:12:45] of people from different nations were
[1:12:46] there uh because Dubai's full of that
[1:12:50] and the people working, you know, from
[1:12:51] different countries and and afterwards
[1:12:53] we had a little fellowship one time and
[1:12:55] this fell came up to me his name was
[1:12:57] actually his true name was little John
[1:13:00] and uh he he at the end of it he came to
[1:13:03] me and he said man he said this is
[1:13:05] unique what you're teaching is really
[1:13:07] unique and I happened to be doing a
[1:13:08] little a little sermon on the serpent
[1:13:10] seed and how the fall came in the
[1:13:12] beginning oh he said this is really
[1:13:14] unique I've never heard anything like
[1:13:15] that he said you know have you ever
[1:13:17] thought about going bigger
[1:13:20] And I said, "What do you got in mind?"
[1:13:22] He said, 'Well, he said, "We could we
[1:13:24] could rent a bigger hall. We could get a
[1:13:26] bigger compound." And he said, "We could
[1:13:28] advertise this. We could have musicians
[1:13:30] coming in. We could be selling books in
[1:13:32] the back. We could have book sellers.
[1:13:34] And we could we could sign up lots of
[1:13:36] people that would be a following of this
[1:13:38] teaching." And he said, "Uh, you know,
[1:13:40] you could be the overseer and we could
[1:13:42] have local pastors." And he said, "I I I
[1:13:45] can see this kind of going big." Well,
[1:13:47] you know, I asked him, I said, "What do
[1:13:49] you do for a living?" As if I didn't
[1:13:50] know by this point. He said, "I'm a
[1:13:52] promoter."
[1:13:54] Who knew? He He said, "I'm I'm a
[1:13:57] promoter of events, you know. I host
[1:14:00] events in different places, you know."
[1:14:01] He said, "And we could really go big
[1:14:03] with this." He said, "We could put your
[1:14:04] name on the on the banner and so forth."
[1:14:06] And I said I said, "No thanks." He said,
[1:14:09] "What do you mean?" I said, "Well, you
[1:14:11] can't join this."
[1:14:14] He said, "Really?" I said, "No, what I'm
[1:14:17] a what I'm a part of here as a part of
[1:14:19] the body of Christ." I said, "You can't
[1:14:21] join. You have to be born into it."
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Oh. He said, "That doesn't matter. We
[1:14:26] can we can sign people up and we can
[1:14:28] have bands and we can have movies and we
[1:14:30] can have all kinds of entertainments." I
[1:14:32] said, "Now, little John, relax." I said,
[1:14:36] "You got to be born into this." And he
[1:14:38] could never get it. He could never catch
[1:14:39] it. And I said, 'I'm not here to try to
[1:14:42] recruit people and re teach people and
[1:14:44] reform people into this. I'm here trying
[1:14:47] to find that last seat. That's what I'm
[1:14:49] after is trying to find the last seat.
[1:14:51] He scratched his head. He went off.
[1:14:52] Never could figure it out. Never came
[1:14:54] back cuz he he felt like I had
[1:14:56] squandered a great opportunity.
[1:14:59] And you know what? In in the in the eyes
[1:15:01] of the world, uh you know, that's the
[1:15:03] way they view it and that's the way they
[1:15:04] interpret it. But for us, hey, listen,
[1:15:07] you can't give somebody eternal life.
[1:15:09] You can't start somebody off on the
[1:15:11] pathway of eternal life because if
[1:15:13] you're eternal, you always were and
[1:15:15] always will be.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Again, brother Lonnie Jenkins used to
[1:15:18] say, God did not decide to have a
[1:15:22] family. God decided to become a family.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And we actually have, if you can handle
[1:15:30] this, we actually are a part of the
[1:15:33] Almighty. We're a part of God. Can you
[1:15:36] believe that? Can you go that far and
[1:15:38] say you're actually a part of God? And
[1:15:39] it's that 3% in there. Let me tell you,
[1:15:41] it's that 3% that keeps you looking
[1:15:44] heavenward. It's that 3% that holds you.
[1:15:46] It's that 3% that that that you know
[1:15:49] when you hear the message of the hour
[1:15:50] preach and something down deep says
[1:15:52] amen. That's right. And even though even
[1:15:54] when we came in the message and we
[1:15:56] didn't know a lick about the Bible, we
[1:15:58] didn't know Old Testament from New and
[1:16:00] we didn't know anything about anything.
[1:16:02] We that's why God sent brother Gerald
[1:16:04] cuz he knew a whole lot more about
[1:16:06] everything than we did. And we didn't
[1:16:07] know anything about anything. But there
[1:16:09] was something on the inside that said
[1:16:10] amen. Every time we heard the word, we
[1:16:12] said amen. And we kept coming and kept
[1:16:14] coming and kept coming and didn't know
[1:16:16] how to live. Didn't know how to worship.
[1:16:18] Didn't know how to sing. Didn't know
[1:16:19] anything. But we kept coming and kept
[1:16:21] coming and kept coming because there was
[1:16:23] a 3% peace in there that all of a sudden
[1:16:25] came alive. And whenever we heard the
[1:16:27] word, we were like those disciples that
[1:16:29] Jesus said when all the people left him
[1:16:31] and and he turned to the disciples and
[1:16:32] said, "Are you going to go too?" And
[1:16:34] they looked at him and said, "Listen, we
[1:16:36] have nowhere to go. We just know this
[1:16:37] that whenever you teach and whenever you
[1:16:39] speak, something inside of us just comes
[1:16:41] alive." And that's the way we were in
[1:16:43] the message of the when we came to the
[1:16:44] message of the hour. We didn't have a
[1:16:46] clue what it actually meant. We didn't
[1:16:48] have a clue where we were where it was
[1:16:49] going to take us. But when when we heard
[1:16:51] it and we heard brother Bam's voice and
[1:16:53] we read the Bible for the first time,
[1:16:55] something inside of us just welled up
[1:16:57] and we said amen to it. And we're still
[1:16:59] saying amen to it because we have that
[1:17:01] 3%.
[1:17:03] The rest of it is a house. The rest of
[1:17:05] it is a is a carrier. That's what it is.
[1:17:07] We thank God for it because it got us to
[1:17:09] where we are. But the 3% is what the the
[1:17:12] husbandman is looking for.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Now you have to separate. You have to
[1:17:17] separate all of that and that's what the
[1:17:19] harvest is about. And brother Bam says
[1:17:22] uh watchmen uh what of the night? Let me
[1:17:24] just go back here just to see if I
[1:17:28] if you know. Okay. He says brother Bram
[1:17:32] says now America's harvest winnowing
[1:17:33] time is here. Separating the chaff.
[1:17:36] That's the time we're living in. This is
[1:17:37] the time. And then how can you hold your
[1:17:40] peace? He says this is the winnowing
[1:17:42] time. Yes. when you when you uh beat the
[1:17:46] husk off the wheat, this is a time uh
[1:17:48] when it's coming. Now, in the natural,
[1:17:51] sorry,
[1:17:54] it's complicated.
[1:17:56] In the natural, winnowing, the wheat
[1:17:58] looks like this. It it's a separation.
[1:18:01] The weed is dried out. The the whole the
[1:18:03] plant is dried out. and they would take
[1:18:04] the a fork, they would sometimes would
[1:18:07] take a tray and they would just scoop up
[1:18:10] uh you know a pile of of the grain and
[1:18:12] throw it in the air and the wheat would
[1:18:14] blow away the chaff, the outside husk,
[1:18:17] the skin and then the the heavier solid
[1:18:20] kernels that fall to the ground. So
[1:18:22] whatever way you do this, it's still the
[1:18:26] same thing. You're separating. So in
[1:18:28] other words, brother Bam's tell us in
[1:18:30] America, we have arrived at the place
[1:18:32] where the winnowing time has come and
[1:18:35] and this is where it's being separated
[1:18:37] now. And that's what you find is is
[1:18:41] going on now is we're in a separating
[1:18:44] time. And brother Brandham, he he says
[1:18:47] it this way in 1960 he said the book of
[1:18:50] Revelation is a book of prophecy and
[1:18:52] therefore it has to be understood by a
[1:18:53] prophetic class.
[1:18:57] The book is not meant for everybody. Now
[1:19:01] the Bible's available to everybody.
[1:19:05] But the revelation of the book is not
[1:19:07] available to everybody.
[1:19:09] He said there's nobody can understand
[1:19:11] it. Hardly this book is made for a
[1:19:13] certain class of people.
[1:19:17] The hidden things belong to the Lord and
[1:19:19] he reveals to us his children the hidden
[1:19:22] things.
[1:19:24] So God hid things not from us but for
[1:19:28] us. God hid things through the ages for
[1:19:31] us in the last day. And he describes us
[1:19:34] as a prophetic class of people of people
[1:19:36] who would respond
[1:19:39] to the unveiling of the mysteries to the
[1:19:42] presence of God to the concept of the
[1:19:45] reality of the end time that we're
[1:19:47] living in.
[1:19:49] All right. Oh, you you knew all of that.
[1:19:51] I told you already.
[1:19:53] It's kind of message 101.
[1:19:55] But when I did this in my church, I
[1:19:57] asked myself three questions. I I was
[1:19:59] just thinking about this.
[1:20:02] What does this mean to me? Like
[1:20:05] personally now, do I really believe
[1:20:08] this?
[1:20:11] And how can I get ready if this truly is
[1:20:14] the harvest and we're going to get out
[1:20:15] of here? Because there's an in gathering
[1:20:18] and an out gathering. There's only two.
[1:20:21] And then I then I started to think, how
[1:20:24] can I help my church get ready for this?
[1:20:28] Those are good questions, Brother Barry.
[1:20:30] Yes, they are. Cuz you're not saying
[1:20:32] anything.
[1:20:36] I thought,
[1:20:38] huh, is there anything I can do to
[1:20:41] prepare?
[1:20:43] Is there anything I can do to help my
[1:20:45] church prepare?
[1:20:48] What is it that I What is it that I need
[1:20:50] to be doing at this particular point if
[1:20:52] we are truly at the end at the harvest
[1:20:55] time?
[1:20:57] By faith, Enoch was translated that he
[1:20:59] should not see death and was not found
[1:21:00] because God had translated him. For
[1:21:03] before his translation,
[1:21:05] aha, here's a little key. Before his
[1:21:08] translation, before God took him, he had
[1:21:10] this testimony. So, he didn't wait till
[1:21:12] he got over there to become a believer
[1:21:14] or act like one. He acted like one over
[1:21:17] here and then God took him.
[1:21:20] So before the translation, he had a
[1:21:22] testimony that what he did pleased God.
[1:21:26] What he did was in harmony with God's
[1:21:28] word or God's instruction. So in other
[1:21:31] words, Enoch knew stuff that he had to
[1:21:34] obey.
[1:21:36] Obedience. Obedience was very much a
[1:21:39] part of this. and obedience was very
[1:21:42] much in harmony with Enoch's walk and
[1:21:46] his communion with God. He had he had
[1:21:50] this testimony and he seemed to maintain
[1:21:52] that testimony until the time God saw
[1:21:55] fit to take him out. And one of these
[1:21:57] days, Brother Ram said, they'll get into
[1:21:59] tribulation and they'll say, "I thought
[1:22:01] the bride was was going to was going and
[1:22:03] the church is going into tribulation."
[1:22:07] Now, think about this for a minute. The
[1:22:09] people who wind up in tribulation
[1:22:12] will slide into it without a realization
[1:22:16] that they're actually there until it's
[1:22:18] too late.
[1:22:20] Because all of a sudden they wake up in
[1:22:21] tribulation, say the things that are
[1:22:23] going on. You know what? This is what
[1:22:25] the Bible calls tribulation.
[1:22:28] Of course, now when you get there, it's
[1:22:30] too late to do anything about it. So you
[1:22:33] want to be like Enoch who has a
[1:22:35] testimony before
[1:22:38] the time. Are you following me? As then
[1:22:41] God took him and the rest were left in
[1:22:44] the times of Noah and the times of
[1:22:46] destruction. And he said the church is
[1:22:48] going right into that but not the bride.
[1:22:50] Now brother Brown teaches us about the
[1:22:53] the squeeze.
[1:22:55] He doesn't give us a lot of detail.
[1:22:57] Matter of fact, he gives us very little.
[1:23:00] But a squeeze is, I think, obvious that,
[1:23:02] you know, it's a it's a slow, gradual
[1:23:05] pressure that creates more tension. And
[1:23:07] I'm not I'm not going to do it. I'm not
[1:23:10] going to do it.
[1:23:12] But it it's think of a toothpaste tube
[1:23:14] that the way to get at what's inside is
[1:23:17] you got to squeeze it. And so God's
[1:23:19] trying to get something out in a season
[1:23:22] where everybody in the world, and I will
[1:23:24] tell you now, I mean, everywhere I go
[1:23:27] and in our own land, our fair land of
[1:23:30] America, you know, it's it's becoming
[1:23:32] harder and and we feel squeezes in
[1:23:35] different ways, right? Financially and
[1:23:38] and socially and religiously and
[1:23:41] everything else. There's pressures now
[1:23:42] that didn't exist. We built our own
[1:23:45] fellowship hall in in our at our church
[1:23:48] because one of the one of the things we
[1:23:50] found is that increasingly
[1:23:52] uh other churches would not rent us a
[1:23:55] their fellowship hall for an event
[1:23:58] because we didn't believe like they
[1:23:59] believed. They'd say, "Well, you're a
[1:24:01] trinitarian, aren't you? You're those
[1:24:03] people over there. You're trinitarian."
[1:24:05] And they wouldn't rent us their
[1:24:06] building. So we wound up biting the
[1:24:09] bullet and and building our own
[1:24:10] fellowship hall because uh things are
[1:24:13] becoming a little more tight all the
[1:24:15] time. Now brother Brandham says this is
[1:24:18] going to go to the place where people
[1:24:19] will wind up in tribulation say hey
[1:24:22] wasn't there supposed to be a message
[1:24:24] that came wasn't there supposed to be a
[1:24:26] prophet that came
[1:24:28] and he says the church is going into
[1:24:30] that but not the bride. Amen. Why? He
[1:24:34] said is this supposed to be first? And
[1:24:36] then the the words, "She's already gone
[1:24:37] and you didn't know it." They'll be
[1:24:39] having church just the same. They'll be
[1:24:40] carrying on just the same. That's a
[1:24:42] pretty subtle thing
[1:24:45] that people will actually be there and
[1:24:47] all of a sudden read their Bible and
[1:24:49] come to the conclusion that this is that
[1:24:53] and have no way out of it. It's kind of
[1:24:56] a sobering thought.
[1:25:00] So Peter asks the same kind of question.
[1:25:03] Seeing then that all these things will
[1:25:05] be dissolved, what manner of persons
[1:25:07] ought you to be
[1:25:09] if this is actually true? And and in
[1:25:11] second Peter, and by the way, second
[1:25:13] Peter is all about the end time. The
[1:25:15] entire book of second Peter is prophetic
[1:25:18] and it's all about the end time.
[1:25:21] And Peter is saying that there will come
[1:25:23] a time when the elements will be
[1:25:24] dissolved. The things of this world will
[1:25:27] be dissolved. Everything's going to
[1:25:28] change. We're going to come to a place
[1:25:30] where uh you know we we go through many
[1:25:33] seasons and they didn't know in the
[1:25:35] early church how many seasons that would
[1:25:36] be how many years. But now all of a
[1:25:38] sudden we come to a place where
[1:25:39] everything gets loosed and that word
[1:25:42] dissolved is a really great and
[1:25:43] interesting word like many Bible words
[1:25:46] it means to unbind or set free. It means
[1:25:50] that somebody for instance swaththed in
[1:25:52] bandages like Lazarus was had to be
[1:25:55] unbound
[1:25:58] bound with a chain or discharged like
[1:26:00] Peter getting out of the prison in the
[1:26:01] book of Acts. You remember the story,
[1:26:03] right? He's bound in prison, but now all
[1:26:06] of a sudden those chains were dissolved
[1:26:09] and he walks free outside the prison.
[1:26:13] And that's what that word means. And it
[1:26:15] it doesn't just mean that somehow or
[1:26:17] another the moon is going to melt and
[1:26:19] the planets are going to dissolve and so
[1:26:21] forth. There will be changes in the
[1:26:23] heaven. But you know also the things
[1:26:26] that bind people will also be no more no
[1:26:32] more able to hold people back but they
[1:26:35] will be able to come free from their
[1:26:37] bondage like
[1:26:39] Lazarus came forth from the grave.
[1:26:42] Whatever held Lazarus, not only the
[1:26:44] bandages,
[1:26:46] but death itself held Lazarus.
[1:26:50] Nothing was strong enough to hold
[1:26:53] Lazarus back at the voice of God.
[1:26:57] Are you following me?
[1:27:00] So Peter is saying that all these things
[1:27:02] shall be dissolved because God is
[1:27:05] interested, listen, God is interested in
[1:27:08] setting every one of you free to become
[1:27:11] what you need to become.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; I like to say it this way that God has
[1:27:18] set us free so that we can come back to
[1:27:21] original design.
[1:27:24] Your original design was like God made
[1:27:27] Adam in the Garden of Eden in the
[1:27:29] beginning without sin, without fear,
[1:27:32] without divorce, without trouble. Right?
[1:27:36] Original design was that man was in
[1:27:38] control of his environment and he lived
[1:27:40] and communed with God. That was his
[1:27:42] chief occupation was to commune with
[1:27:44] God. And the original design of Adam is
[1:27:47] what we've been released to become.
[1:27:51] We're going to have to leave this earth
[1:27:52] because this earth is cursed. We're
[1:27:54] going to have to be in a better place
[1:27:56] and so forth. But God has set us free
[1:28:00] to recognize that we are the sons and
[1:28:02] daughters of God and one day we will
[1:28:04] cross over into eternity and live with
[1:28:05] him forever because that was God's
[1:28:07] original design in the first place.
[1:28:10] Are we okay?
[1:28:12] All right. So this this idea Peter is
[1:28:16] asking the question though if this is
[1:28:18] the time when God is setting the bride
[1:28:20] free from denominations and from false
[1:28:23] doctrine and from all the other things
[1:28:24] in life then what kind of people should
[1:28:27] we be? And there that comes back to my
[1:28:29] question again. What kind of people
[1:28:31] really should we be?
[1:28:33] Now, there are different
[1:28:35] characteristics, but I I love this
[1:28:37] statement and and I want you to just
[1:28:39] it's got an asterisk next to it, and
[1:28:41] that really means something to my
[1:28:42] church. When they see the asterisk, they
[1:28:44] go like, "Oh, everybody wake up." They
[1:28:46] look around the pews and make sure
[1:28:47] everyone's awake.
[1:28:50] Watch what he watch says here. It's all
[1:28:54] connected together. God deals with the
[1:28:56] Jews as individuals. Not sorry, not as
[1:28:59] individuals, but as a nation. And
[1:29:02] Israel's ready to receive the spirit
[1:29:03] when Elijah and Moses will appear to
[1:29:05] them after the rapture of the church.
[1:29:08] Israel's ready to receive the spirit
[1:29:11] when Elijah and Moses will appear to
[1:29:13] them
[1:29:15] after you go.
[1:29:18] So everything depends on us going. All
[1:29:21] the next events depend on us going. The
[1:29:24] next real big thing is for us to leave
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; because then Joseph can reveal himself
[1:29:30] to his brother. Right? So it all Hey,
[1:29:34] look. If we don't have if we don't have
[1:29:37] rapturing faith,
[1:29:40] we've missed the main thing. Rapturing
[1:29:44] faith is the faith that gets us from
[1:29:46] here to where we need to be.
[1:29:49] If we don't have that, what's the good
[1:29:52] of anything? Because you're still going
[1:29:54] to be here during the tribulation,
[1:29:56] right?
[1:29:57] Wouldn't you agree? Rapturing faith is
[1:29:59] the thing that's going to take you out
[1:30:00] of here.
[1:30:01] So think about this now. Israel is ready
[1:30:04] to receive the spirit when Elijah and
[1:30:06] Moses will appear to them after the
[1:30:09] rapture of the church, the fig tree
[1:30:11] putting forth its buds and so forth. So
[1:30:13] they're coming to the homeland, but
[1:30:15] Israel will be received as a as a
[1:30:17] nation. We're all where we're where as
[1:30:19] individuals, Abraham's seed, that was
[1:30:20] the Holy Spirit. And the angel of the
[1:30:22] Lord is on earth. Now
[1:30:26] God deals with the Jews. I'm clicking
[1:30:29] the wrong one. God deals he he's he's on
[1:30:33] earth now moving around fixing
[1:30:35] everything for the coming of the Lord.
[1:30:37] And it's the same angels
[1:30:41] that's heard the sin when they went down
[1:30:44] to Sodom and we've come down to see
[1:30:46] whether these things are so.
[1:30:49] And one stayed with Abraham the elect.
[1:30:52] Sodom was down there and Lot was in
[1:30:53] Sodom. Two angels went down there
[1:30:55] preached to them and brought that little
[1:30:57] uh bitty group out sleeping virgin. But
[1:30:59] the one angel stayed with Abraham. Now,
[1:31:01] now just think about what he just said.
[1:31:04] He said the same angels that visited
[1:31:06] Sodom and moved everything around in
[1:31:08] position before the fire fell, those
[1:31:10] same angels are on the scene here.
[1:31:14] Huh?
[1:31:16] I believe with all my heart. I believe
[1:31:19] with all my heart there came a time when
[1:31:22] and you can go out in the lobby and look
[1:31:23] at that ad that was put in the paper
[1:31:25] there and God said because these angels
[1:31:28] are on the scene and came and said we're
[1:31:30] going to take Mark out of the Catholic
[1:31:32] church and we're going to put him in the
[1:31:34] light of the message of the hour. We're
[1:31:36] going to put him here. Took him out of
[1:31:39] the church. Right. Never went back
[1:31:41] because an angel took him out of there
[1:31:42] and put put him in the right place. And
[1:31:45] then that same angel uh took me, put me
[1:31:47] out, put me in the same place, and then
[1:31:49] took brother Bob, and then took sister
[1:31:52] Brenda, put us in the in the in the
[1:31:54] right place. We were in a completely
[1:31:56] different place. But but now something
[1:31:59] happened that brought us from where we
[1:32:00] were to where we are now. Whoa. And then
[1:32:04] Sister Coffee, Sister Coffee, the
[1:32:06] skeptic, she's standing there and she
[1:32:08] says, she said to me that morning,
[1:32:10] "Maybe I need a sign." When Bob and
[1:32:12] Brenda were getting baptized, she said
[1:32:14] to me in the kitchen, she said, "Maybe I
[1:32:16] need a sign." And I looked at her and
[1:32:18] pointed my crooked finger at her crooked
[1:32:20] finger. And I said to her, "Maybe Bob
[1:32:23] was your sign." Because of all the most
[1:32:24] unlikely people to ever be converted and
[1:32:26] become a Christian. Sorry for you
[1:32:29] grandchildren here. Sorry about that.
[1:32:30] But I said, "Maybe Bob was your sign." I
[1:32:33] just turned and went off like that. And
[1:32:35] she just
[1:32:38] hard to beat that one.
[1:32:40] And you know here we were there we were
[1:32:42] there remember and we were baptizing Bob
[1:32:44] and Brenda we were standing there by the
[1:32:45] side of the swimming pool and and uh
[1:32:47] singing Amazing Grace because that's the
[1:32:49] only song we knew because Willie Nielson
[1:32:50] sang it as the only Christian song we
[1:32:52] knew singing Amazing Grace. And I opened
[1:32:54] one eye and looked around and here was
[1:32:55] Nan climbing down the ladder to get in
[1:32:58] the pool. You know, no one told her. She
[1:33:00] just and I mean 50 years in the Catholic
[1:33:02] Church just washed down the drain and
[1:33:04] here she is standing in the pool. You
[1:33:05] know what that was? That was not mom.
[1:33:07] That was the angel of the same one that
[1:33:09] went to Sodom and said, "I want you
[1:33:11] right here and I want you right here and
[1:33:13] the old lady back here. I want you and
[1:33:15] take her back up here." And now all of a
[1:33:17] sudden the angel says, "We got a church
[1:33:19] now."
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And you think it's you, Sister Sandy.
[1:33:27] You think it's you. you know, all of a
[1:33:29] sudden here's this here's this guy
[1:33:31] working on the oil rigs and here's this
[1:33:33] here's this family shows up in town and
[1:33:35] and uh you know just people we never
[1:33:39] knew and all of a sudden the angel says
[1:33:41] I I want you right here
[1:33:44] and I want you right here and Nathan and
[1:33:49] Elena and Jess all of you know all of a
[1:33:52] sudden they're moving around you didn't
[1:33:54] decide that
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; you didn't make up your mind all of a
[1:33:57] sudden one day I'm going to go find me a
[1:33:59] message church.
[1:34:01] You didn't do that. There's an angel on
[1:34:03] the scene and we're not really supposed
[1:34:05] to see angels very much, but it's the
[1:34:07] same one that went to Sodom. So, they
[1:34:09] got experience and they know how to
[1:34:10] pluck people out of the out of the
[1:34:12] gutter. And here they are taking us hand
[1:34:15] by the hand and placing us in a place
[1:34:17] here and putting us in a position. And
[1:34:19] once you get there, you don't ever want
[1:34:22] to go back.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; You don't ever want to go back.
[1:34:27] It's, you know what it is? It's the hand
[1:34:29] of God. It's the hand of Almighty God
[1:34:32] that brought us there. And then so God
[1:34:34] looking at this pew and God looking at
[1:34:35] this pew and thinking, "Wow, don't tell
[1:34:37] me I don't have a sense of humor." So he
[1:34:39] goes down Bure Bern and takes Brother
[1:34:41] Gerald and says, "I want you to come."
[1:34:43] And he's positioning him right here in
[1:34:45] front of this church and him and Sister
[1:34:47] Betty and Sister Dunford. And here they
[1:34:49] are, you know, living in St. John's. Who
[1:34:52] ever thought a boy from Burean Bayern
[1:34:53] would be living in St. John's? Here he
[1:34:55] is in working a shoppers drug Mart and
[1:34:57] he had it all arranged. And here's
[1:34:58] Gerald now preaching away. We never
[1:35:00] orchestrated that. We drove the truck,
[1:35:04] Mark and I. We drove the truck, but we
[1:35:06] never orchestrated that. We never went
[1:35:08] down and said, "All right, Brother Jer,
[1:35:09] we're going to give you 50,000 or
[1:35:11] 55,000." No, we'll give you 57,000 a
[1:35:14] year. We didn't do that. Here's a church
[1:35:17] without a pastor. Here's a pastor
[1:35:18] without a church. And and God, you know,
[1:35:20] these angels know exactly how to bring
[1:35:22] these things together. He knows exactly.
[1:35:25] He's moving. Look, look at the second
[1:35:26] line. He's moving around fixing
[1:35:29] everything for the coming of the Lord.
[1:35:30] You know why? Because we as the elect of
[1:35:33] God, we needed a pastor.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And here was a pastor who needed a
[1:35:39] church.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; And then God says, "All right, we're
[1:35:43] going to take Sister Marine. We're going
[1:35:44] to put her way out here in St. Anthony.
[1:35:48] And we're going to way out here, and
[1:35:50] she's going to be all the way out here,
[1:35:52] St. Anthony." in the in the in the end
[1:35:54] of the world.
[1:35:58] Hang out there for two years. Just calm
[1:36:00] down. We'll see if we can get Ray and
[1:36:02] Kit to calm down a little bit there.
[1:36:03] It'll be all right.
[1:36:06] Then he brings her back.
[1:36:09] Here they are married. I was there. I
[1:36:11] saw it. I was the only one there outside
[1:36:13] of Gerald and Betty. Jerry Betty played
[1:36:14] the organ. I was there. We went to the
[1:36:16] captain's quarter, remember? And had
[1:36:17] supper afterwards. Yeah, remember that?
[1:36:19] Terry Sprules for dinner. And so I mean
[1:36:22] I but it was just a handful of us. But
[1:36:24] you know what? We weren't planning that.
[1:36:28] There's an angel that knows exactly
[1:36:29] where we're all supposed to be and he's
[1:36:31] fixing everything for the coming of the
[1:36:32] Lord. So you people that are here, you
[1:36:34] know, you kind of think, well, I just
[1:36:35] wandered in. I'm going to be here as
[1:36:36] long as I want. No. What if what about
[1:36:38] if God sent an angel to place you just
[1:36:41] where you're sitting today? And maybe he
[1:36:43] wants you to hear a certain thing. You
[1:36:44] know what? Because he knows more than
[1:36:46] you do.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; And he knows where you need to be. Let's
[1:36:51] Who knew that God knew what was going on
[1:36:54] and where you needed to be? Think about
[1:36:56] that. Just think about that alone.
[1:37:00] Now, back out a little bit and picture
[1:37:03] this. The whole world is in a place
[1:37:05] where it needs to be. It's all connected
[1:37:08] together.
[1:37:12] Maybe you forgot the quote already.
[1:37:15] It's all connected together.
[1:37:22] So at the center of all of it is Christ
[1:37:25] as he's come down to make it all happen.
[1:37:28] And you have the bride move to her
[1:37:30] place. You have Israel moved to its
[1:37:33] place.
[1:37:35] You have the cosmos and the world the
[1:37:36] way they are. You have the national
[1:37:38] powers. You have the church in in its
[1:37:40] place. And brother Brandham said, "And
[1:37:43] now we're moving. We've moved up into a
[1:37:45] bride age. calling out of the church and
[1:37:48] getting it ready for the rapture. Let's
[1:37:50] look at it. Here's the bride now. And
[1:37:52] our we know exactly where we are now.
[1:37:53] This is Revelation 10:8-11, right? John
[1:37:56] takes the book, eats the book,
[1:37:58] prophesies, you know, becomes like honey
[1:38:00] in his mouth, bitter in his belly, and
[1:38:02] he prophesies again. He's not
[1:38:04] prophesying something new. He's
[1:38:05] prophesying something again. So, we're
[1:38:08] we're we're we're preaching the same
[1:38:10] truth, walking in the same light. And
[1:38:11] then you have Israel. Look, if you don't
[1:38:13] believe me, read Zechariah chapter 12,
[1:38:16] 13, and 14, and it'll tell you exactly
[1:38:18] what's happening in our day, exactly
[1:38:20] what's happening. And Israel is exactly
[1:38:23] where it needs to be. And it's not
[1:38:25] because all the nations of the world
[1:38:26] said, "Why don't we just let Israel go
[1:38:28] home? Why don't we just let them have
[1:38:30] uh, you know, Palestine? How about that?
[1:38:31] Why don't we just agree to do that?"
[1:38:33] Hey, they didn't want that to happen at
[1:38:35] all. But an angel said, "Out of the way.
[1:38:37] Excuse me. Out of the way. Out of the
[1:38:38] way. Out of the way. I'm putting Israel
[1:38:40] right here. Whether the whether the UN
[1:38:42] votes for it or not doesn't matter.
[1:38:44] According to the word, Israel is
[1:38:45] supposed to be back in our homeland.
[1:38:47] Excuse me. Get out of the way. Excuse
[1:38:48] me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Bang.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And Abdul Nasser, the president of
[1:38:53] Egypt, and all the other politicians who
[1:38:56] uh who came around and said, "We're
[1:38:57] going to push them into the sea, and
[1:38:59] we're going to have a seven-day war."
[1:39:00] And so on. And the angel says, "Hold on.
[1:39:03] I put them there. And if I put them
[1:39:05] there, I'm sorry. You're not going to
[1:39:06] push them into the sea. Watch this.
[1:39:07] It'll only take me six days, but we'll
[1:39:09] call it the seven-day war." And then
[1:39:10] bang, all of a sudden, Israel defeats
[1:39:13] Egypt and defeats all the other Arab
[1:39:15] nations around there. You know why?
[1:39:16] Because Israel didn't put itself there.
[1:39:18] God put Israel there.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; And in the same vein, if God put you
[1:39:24] where you are today, the devil can't
[1:39:25] take you out.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; I said the devil cannot take you out. If
[1:39:29] God put you where you are today in the
[1:39:31] body of Christ, the devil can't take you
[1:39:32] out. I got news for you. If God put your
[1:39:34] name on the lamb's book of life, the
[1:39:36] devil can't take it off.
[1:39:38] Nobody can take it off. You can't take
[1:39:40] it off. If God put your name on the
[1:39:42] lamb's book of life, it's on there and
[1:39:44] it's on there for eternity.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The the world becomes like
[1:39:48] the days of Sodom. We have uh you know
[1:39:50] the interplay of nations now and the
[1:39:52] geopolitics that all takes place and
[1:39:55] it's constantly changing, constantly
[1:39:57] changing. I live in the land of of of
[1:40:00] many Trumps and uh you know, I mean,
[1:40:02] it's just constantly every day something
[1:40:04] different happening. And then you have
[1:40:06] foolish virgins and you have the church
[1:40:08] and you have the bride and all of it all
[1:40:10] of it works together. And brother
[1:40:13] Bandham said all of it is connected
[1:40:15] together.
[1:40:17] All of it is.
[1:40:19] So it's not random events that are just
[1:40:21] taking place. It is truly the end of the
[1:40:26] world. And Jesus said, "Let it both grow
[1:40:28] together until the end of the world."
[1:40:30] And he said, "The word that fell on the
[1:40:33] day of Pentecost will not work today."
[1:40:35] This is for the bride. The going home of
[1:40:37] the bride. So what God held back
[1:40:40] prophetically
[1:40:41] for the bride was for the going home of
[1:40:44] the bride. So God didn't give this to
[1:40:47] the fifth church age or the third church
[1:40:49] age. He gave it to the last one because
[1:40:50] the last one's going to take it home. I
[1:40:53] said the last age is going to take it
[1:40:54] home. Not the first church age, not the
[1:40:56] second church age, but the last one. So
[1:40:58] God had to give us a message that would
[1:41:00] contain lift.
[1:41:02] It would contain thrust. Are you with
[1:41:05] me? It would not only have salvation in
[1:41:07] it, and it would not only have
[1:41:08] redemption in it. It would not only have
[1:41:10] deliverance in it. It would not only
[1:41:11] have peace, joy, and communion in it,
[1:41:13] but it would have lift
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; because you're going to need lift to get
[1:41:17] out of here.
[1:41:21] So, he gave us a unique word.
[1:41:25] Now, this is what's interesting. Here's
[1:41:27] a principle about harvest you may not
[1:41:29] have thought about. Number one, if you
[1:41:31] have planted a seed, a harvest is
[1:41:33] inevitable. It's an expected outcome. In
[1:41:36] other words, if you plant a seed, you're
[1:41:37] going to get something,
[1:41:39] right? I mean, you're going to you're
[1:41:41] something's going to be uh mature at the
[1:41:43] end of it.
[1:41:45] You cannot change the outcome in the
[1:41:48] harvest.
[1:41:50] So, in other words, at a harvest time,
[1:41:51] you can't look at the field and say, "I
[1:41:53] don't like that." You can't change it
[1:41:55] there. If you're going to get a
[1:41:58] different harvest, you got to sew a
[1:41:59] different crop.
[1:42:01] Are you following me? This is the three
[1:42:04] principles about harvest that we all
[1:42:05] need to know. You know, if your children
[1:42:07] turn out bad when they're 16, you can't
[1:42:11] just magically wave a wand over them and
[1:42:13] turn them out differently. You're going
[1:42:14] to have to start sewing a different seed
[1:42:16] in the heart of that child to get a
[1:42:18] better outcome later on.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Because every seed brings forth of its
[1:42:23] kind.
[1:42:27] So if you want to obtain a different
[1:42:28] crop, you sow different seeds. God knew
[1:42:30] exactly what he was planting in the
[1:42:32] beginning. So he's going to get the
[1:42:33] right outcome in the harvest. And that's
[1:42:36] exactly what's taking place. All right.
[1:42:37] Now, think about this on a on a on the
[1:42:39] macro scale. Okay? The angel is on earth
[1:42:42] and he knows where everything needs to
[1:42:43] be. So God takes gold to my air. He the
[1:42:48] angel, the same one who visited Sodom,
[1:42:50] and brings her to Washington.
[1:42:53] God takes
[1:42:55] God takes after John Kennedy because
[1:42:58] Nixon ran against John Kennedy but and
[1:43:02] in remember in that election some of you
[1:43:04] oldtimers will remember that at the
[1:43:07] election the first election between John
[1:43:09] Kennedy and Richard Nixon was the
[1:43:10] introduction of television and
[1:43:12] television politics dawned in the days
[1:43:16] of the election of Nixon and Kennedy and
[1:43:19] all the women looked at their TVs and
[1:43:21] said how handsome John Kennedy was and
[1:43:24] voted wanted him to be president because
[1:43:26] Nixon was more on the ugly side. And so
[1:43:30] God was waiting now until
[1:43:33] Nixon is needed and the angel moves John
[1:43:36] Kennedy in for a couple of years and
[1:43:38] then all of a sudden got Nixon ready
[1:43:40] who's friendly towards Israel and moves
[1:43:43] him in office and then goes to Israel
[1:43:45] and takes gold to my ear and puts the
[1:43:47] two of them together and she says we
[1:43:49] don't have any weapons.
[1:43:51] Nixon says, "I can help you with that."
[1:43:54] Because God ar I believe God arranged it
[1:43:56] to have a a Jew an Israel friendly
[1:43:59] president in office at the time that
[1:44:01] Israel needed help most.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you how destitute they
[1:44:06] were. If you read the biography of Ezer
[1:44:08] Visman who was the uh pilot during the
[1:44:11] the early days of resettlement in
[1:44:14] Israel, they would practice their
[1:44:16] bombing runs uh that in the desert
[1:44:19] against their enemies and they would
[1:44:21] take sacks of flour, bags of flour, and
[1:44:24] they would hold open the window of the
[1:44:26] plane and go along and drop them to see
[1:44:29] the trajectory of the bomb, which was a
[1:44:31] bag of flour, and see where it exploded
[1:44:34] on the ground. And that's the way they
[1:44:35] trained their pilots because their bombs
[1:44:37] were so few and so precious. They didn't
[1:44:40] want to waste their bombs in practice
[1:44:42] runs. So they were using bags of flour
[1:44:46] and they would drop them like that and
[1:44:47] see where they landed. They would save
[1:44:49] their bombs for the real battles. They
[1:44:52] were so hard up for ammunition. Golden
[1:44:54] Mayer said, "Where can I go? Where what
[1:44:56] nation can I go to?" And there was no
[1:44:58] other nation she could turn to but
[1:45:00] America. But God had moved a Israel
[1:45:02] friendly president in place and said,
[1:45:04] "We'll help you out. What do you need?
[1:45:06] We'll help you out."
[1:45:08] Do you think God's on the scene moving
[1:45:10] things around? Absolutely. Do you
[1:45:13] realize these two men had to be in power
[1:45:15] to drive Israel back to the tree of
[1:45:18] life?
[1:45:20] Soviet Jews arriving at at L airport
[1:45:24] January 17, 1972 back in Tel Aviv. You
[1:45:27] know why? Because the angel now is
[1:45:29] allowing those Jews to come back from
[1:45:31] Soviet dominated countries back into
[1:45:33] Israel because the angel knows exactly
[1:45:36] where Israel is supposed to be.
[1:45:40] He knows that better than you and I. He
[1:45:41] knows it better than the politicians. He
[1:45:44] knows exactly where things are supposed
[1:45:46] to be. And then even today in a more
[1:45:48] modern context, you have these leaders
[1:45:51] that are uh you know, they're bargaining
[1:45:52] over this and moving this around over
[1:45:54] here and and uh you know, debating over
[1:45:56] different things right here. Uh let me
[1:45:58] tell you something, saints of God. The
[1:46:00] angel knows exactly where they're
[1:46:01] supposed to be and the angel knows
[1:46:03] exactly where you're supposed to be.
[1:46:05] Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; So at the end of the ages,
[1:46:11] at the end of the ages, the churches,
[1:46:13] the church goes into Leodysia
[1:46:16] and it goes into darkness and a judgment
[1:46:18] cycle begins in the earth. And this is
[1:46:19] just uh like a little summary points.
[1:46:22] The b the bride enters into what's
[1:46:24] called the bride age and we begin that
[1:46:26] harvest season or that rapture season.
[1:46:28] And then number three, the cycle of
[1:46:30] restoration of Israel begins and the
[1:46:32] Antichrist begins to rise to rule. And
[1:46:34] that's what that's what happens all
[1:46:36] around us here because God is
[1:46:38] orchestrating things to take place.
[1:46:40] Israel has this promise. I would not,
[1:46:43] brethren, have you ignorant concerning
[1:46:45] this mystery, lest you should be wise in
[1:46:46] your own conceits that blindness in part
[1:46:48] has happened to Israel until the harvest
[1:46:50] time.
[1:46:52] Are you still there? until the the the
[1:46:55] end of all things, the end of the
[1:46:57] gentile dispensation, and then then that
[1:46:59] that the the the bride will come uh to
[1:47:02] their place and then there will be a a a
[1:47:04] message that comes to Israel.
[1:47:10] You still good?
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; You think it's not connected or you
[1:47:15] think you're making decisions. I'll tell
[1:47:17] you, there's an angel watching over you
[1:47:18] to make you to make you be in the right
[1:47:21] place at the right time because God's
[1:47:24] got a hand upon you.
[1:47:28] Now, I'm going to close with an example
[1:47:31] because the question is uh and I mean I
[1:47:35] I did a little series on this. What
[1:47:37] manner of people should we be? Um how
[1:47:39] can I prepare myself? And and there's
[1:47:41] lots of different ways that your pastor
[1:47:43] can take that and run with it. And
[1:47:45] there's there's lots of things that we
[1:47:47] can do in our own lives and our own
[1:47:48] churches and our own ministries and so
[1:47:50] on to prepare and to prepare the people
[1:47:53] who God gives us to as a congregation to
[1:47:56] work with. And and there are things that
[1:47:58] you can all do. We can make our our
[1:48:01] situations better. We can make our
[1:48:02] situations financially better. We can
[1:48:04] make you know apply the token in our
[1:48:06] home perhaps in a more focused way or
[1:48:09] how there's lots of different things we
[1:48:10] can talk about here.
[1:48:13] But when we ask the question what manner
[1:48:15] of people we should be,
[1:48:18] let me just give you one characteristic
[1:48:21] that I think that God wants to see in
[1:48:23] us. And that one characteristic is
[1:48:26] obedience.
[1:48:28] All right. Now, let me show you an
[1:48:30] example of obedience. There are a couple
[1:48:32] just biblical ones here.
[1:48:35] And the Bible tells us that Shadrach,
[1:48:37] Meshach, and Abednego, you know this,
[1:48:39] and they answered and said to the king,
[1:48:40] "Oh Nebuchadnezzar, we're not careful to
[1:48:44] answer thee of this matter. If it be so,
[1:48:46] our God whom we serve is able to deliver
[1:48:48] us from the burning fire." So here they
[1:48:50] are, they're standing on the edge of the
[1:48:52] fiery furnace, right?
[1:48:54] And they said, "Oh, king. Hey,
[1:48:58] our job here
[1:49:00] is to stand here and put our trust
[1:49:03] completely in God, and he will deliver
[1:49:05] us out of thy hand, O king. But if not,
[1:49:09] be it known unto thee, O king, that we
[1:49:11] will not serve thy gods, nor worship the
[1:49:13] golden image who thou hast set up." Our
[1:49:16] our banner here today is obed. We're
[1:49:18] going to obey God. And no matter what
[1:49:21] happens here, we're going to obey him
[1:49:22] first and foremost because that's what
[1:49:25] we know is right for us to do. And then
[1:49:28] when they came out of the fiery furnace,
[1:49:30] the king said, "Shedra, Meshach, and
[1:49:32] Abedneo." They answered the king and
[1:49:34] said, "Sorry, Nebuchadnezzar spoke and
[1:49:37] said, I'm sorry.
[1:49:41] This this pointer wants to go to lunch.
[1:49:48] Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach,
[1:49:50] and Abednego, who had sent his angel and
[1:49:53] delivered his servants that trusted in
[1:49:55] him, and have changed the king's word.
[1:49:57] Think about what what the king is saying
[1:49:59] now. Blessed be the God of these three,
[1:50:02] who has sent his angel. There's that
[1:50:04] those angels again. And delivered his
[1:50:07] servants that trusted in him
[1:50:10] and have chains the king's word. The
[1:50:12] king's word says they should die. But
[1:50:15] somehow or another, there's a
[1:50:16] supernatural power that's at work here.
[1:50:18] And what they did actually changed the
[1:50:21] king's word and yielded their bodies
[1:50:24] that they might not serve nor worship
[1:50:26] any god except their own god.
[1:50:30] Look at these guys here. He said they
[1:50:32] obeyed God. They followed God and obeyed
[1:50:34] him right to the very end. And it was so
[1:50:36] powerful that God delivered them and
[1:50:39] changed my command. Nobody changes the
[1:50:42] king's command.
[1:50:44] Therefore, I make a decree that every
[1:50:45] people, nation, and language which spoke
[1:50:47] anything against the God of Shadrach,
[1:50:49] Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in
[1:50:51] pieces, and their houses shall be made a
[1:50:52] dung hill because there is no other god
[1:50:54] that can deliver this sort.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Hey, we we missed it. We missed it. If
[1:51:02] we're going to serve a god, serve the
[1:51:03] god that they serve. Because these guys
[1:51:06] in their obedience to their God, he
[1:51:09] moved on behalf of those people and
[1:51:12] actually changed the word of the king
[1:51:13] and preserved them alive be despite the
[1:51:16] fire. And and if we Hey, listen. If
[1:51:18] we're going to bow to any god, let's bow
[1:51:20] to their god.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; We missed it, folks.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Let's repent. Let's come back. Let's get
[1:51:24] it right. That's what he's actually
[1:51:26] saying to them.
[1:51:29] Obedience
[1:51:31] is a powerful thing.
[1:51:34] Obedience is an important thing
[1:51:41] and I want to give you a statement.
[1:51:45] Now let me just just give me a sec here
[1:51:49] and I I just want to
[1:51:53] I just want to find one thing that
[1:51:54] brother Brandham says and we'll we'll
[1:51:56] come back to this.
[1:52:01] Brother Brandham said that obedience
[1:52:04] is what God wants.
[1:52:07] Obedience is what God wants.
[1:52:11] Your money is not what God wants. Your
[1:52:14] beautiful singing voice is not what God
[1:52:17] wants. God wants your obedience.
[1:52:21] Brother Ram said, "Obedience is better
[1:52:23] than sacrifice."
[1:52:25] And here's a quote. To obey the Lord is
[1:52:27] better than any sacrifice that you could
[1:52:29] do.
[1:52:31] To obey the Lord is better than any
[1:52:33] sacrifice you could do. Bear with me
[1:52:35] now. I'm not going to be long.
[1:52:38] Now, in this example here that I want to
[1:52:40] give you,
[1:52:44] this is a this is an interesting
[1:52:47] example.
[1:52:50] Jonathan and his servant,
[1:52:54] he they they realize that they're in a
[1:52:56] stalemate against the Philistines and
[1:52:58] they can't go anywhere. They're kind of
[1:53:00] locked down because of the Philistines.
[1:53:03] And uh
[1:53:06] Jonathan feels inspired to break this
[1:53:09] impass, to break this block, and he says
[1:53:12] to his armor bearer, "Follow me. Do what
[1:53:15] I do." Now, to me, the armor bearer is
[1:53:18] the real hero in this story because he
[1:53:19] just he's he's got real faith and trust
[1:53:21] in in Jonathan. So, he says, "Okay,
[1:53:24] boss, whatever you say." So, they they
[1:53:25] they move off and they go to the bottom
[1:53:28] of a cliff. Now, right above them is the
[1:53:30] Philistine camp. They're right up here
[1:53:33] and and it's all rocky. They're all up
[1:53:35] on top of the hill. And uh Jonathan says
[1:53:39] to his armor bearer, he says, "Hey,
[1:53:41] watch what happens." He said, "I'm going
[1:53:43] to jump out and show myself. They don't
[1:53:45] know we're here, but I'm going to jump
[1:53:46] out and show myself. And if they say,
[1:53:48] "Hey, you rascal, we're going to come
[1:53:50] down and kill you." He says, "That'll be
[1:53:52] one sign, and we'll go back to the
[1:53:54] camp." But if they say, "Hey, you come
[1:53:56] up here, you dog. Come on up here, and
[1:53:59] we'll take you on." If they say that,
[1:54:02] then the Lord has given the whole battle
[1:54:04] into our hands, and we're going to be
[1:54:05] victorious. So, one or the other is
[1:54:07] going to happen, right? The armor beer
[1:54:09] says, "Yeah, he's a great guy. I mean,
[1:54:10] but I think we'll see him in heaven.
[1:54:14] He says there, but now the whole camp's
[1:54:16] up. Yes, the whole camp's up there and
[1:54:18] you're going to jump out. Yeah, I'm
[1:54:19] going to jump out. You just follow me.
[1:54:21] All right. Okay. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:25] So Jonathan jumps out and he says, "Hey,
[1:54:29] you Philistines,
[1:54:33] look who it is, son of the king." And
[1:54:36] the men of the garrison answered
[1:54:38] Jonathan and said, "Come up here, and we
[1:54:41] will show you something." Jonathan said
[1:54:44] unto his arm bear, "Come up after me,
[1:54:47] for the Lord has delivered them into our
[1:54:49] hand." The Lord has delivered them into
[1:54:51] the hand of Israel. We're going to win
[1:54:53] now because they call us up to the top
[1:54:55] of the hill." Now, the next sentence is
[1:54:57] extraordinary. Here's a man going up to
[1:55:00] conquer an entire camp of Philistines,
[1:55:02] armed and ready, and have the high
[1:55:04] ground. And you know how he's going up
[1:55:06] the hill? He's going up like this. Read
[1:55:10] the Bible verse. Don't look at me. Read
[1:55:12] the Bible verse.
[1:55:16] It says that he climbed up on his hands
[1:55:18] and his feet. That's not a position for
[1:55:21] a warrior to defeat a whole army of
[1:55:24] Philistines
[1:55:26] like this, right? I'm coming to get you.
[1:55:29] We're going to destroy all of you. I'll
[1:55:31] be there in a minute. and he's climbing
[1:55:34] up on his hands and knees
[1:55:38] and he wins.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; He wins the battle. Read the Bible. They
[1:55:43] win the battle. And the and the
[1:55:45] Philistines are up there. It's got to be
[1:55:47] some sort of secret weapon or something.
[1:55:49] And and they they start fighting
[1:55:50] themselves and and then the rest of the
[1:55:52] Israelites saw this and they said, "Hey,
[1:55:54] there's a commotion over on the top of
[1:55:55] the hill. Let's go." And so they all ran
[1:55:56] over and the Philistines run off and a
[1:55:58] whole bunch of them are killed and so
[1:55:59] on. It's just God's way of honoring the
[1:56:02] obedience
[1:56:04] of his children. God will make things
[1:56:06] happen as a result of obedience that
[1:56:08] sometimes we underestimate in a great
[1:56:10] way because we Yeah. I mean, we all face
[1:56:13] impossible situations, situations that
[1:56:15] need a good shock and they need a good
[1:56:17] upset and and we don't know how to fix
[1:56:19] it. We don't know how to change it. But
[1:56:20] all of a sudden, God will change it by
[1:56:21] somebody just obeying his word. And you
[1:56:24] watch what God will do. God's got all
[1:56:25] kinds of resources.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't say, "Defeat all your
[1:56:30] enemies." He, you know what he says? He
[1:56:31] says in Matthew 6:33, "And this has been
[1:56:33] my theme for a long time. Just seek
[1:56:35] first the kingdom of God
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; and his righteousness and all this other
[1:56:38] stuff will be added onto you. I've got
[1:56:40] the resources. I've got the answer. I've
[1:56:42] got the manpower. You just need to seek
[1:56:44] first the kingdom of God and watch what
[1:56:45] I will do as a result of you seeking
[1:56:47] first the kingdom of God."
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a great verse and that's
[1:56:51] a whole other series alto together. But
[1:56:53] here I'm just illustrating the fact that
[1:56:55] here's an example of one man and his
[1:56:57] servant and you got to hand it to the
[1:56:59] servant who who came up on his hands and
[1:57:01] knees as well. And and and they just
[1:57:03] obeyed the simple voice of God telling
[1:57:05] them what to do and they did it and God
[1:57:07] took care of the whole camp and they won
[1:57:08] the battle.
[1:57:13] And you know I could stop there and it
[1:57:15] would be good.
[1:57:17] But can I give you one more example?
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; And this is one you're not expecting.
[1:57:25] What a promise. Brother Brandham said
[1:57:26] because of obedience. This is he talking
[1:57:28] about Abraham.
[1:57:30] Obedience is what God wants.
[1:57:33] Say it with me. Obedience is what God
[1:57:36] wants. Now everybody say it. Obedience
[1:57:39] is what God wants. It was once said,
[1:57:41] "Obedience is better than sacrifice."
[1:57:43] And obey the Lord is better than any
[1:57:44] sacrifice you could do. Now, here's a
[1:57:47] story. It's one of those dark stories in
[1:57:50] the Bible. If you go back one chapter in
[1:57:53] Judges 19, there was a horrible,
[1:57:56] horrible act that was perpetrated
[1:57:59] against the concubine of a Levite
[1:58:03] uh back in uh the tribe of of Judah. And
[1:58:08] I mean, it was terrible. And I don't
[1:58:09] need to go into details. You you adults
[1:58:10] can read it later on. And the the sin
[1:58:13] was so offensive and so grievious to the
[1:58:17] rest of the tribes of Israel. They said,
[1:58:19] "Give us the men who committed that
[1:58:20] murder. Give us the as they should be.
[1:58:22] It should be a life for life and we will
[1:58:24] we'll we'll judge that man." And the
[1:58:28] people in Judah said, "No way. Ain't no
[1:58:31] way." And they set themselves against
[1:58:35] the other tribes.
[1:58:39] And the other tribes knew that they
[1:58:40] could not tolerate this sin in the camp.
[1:58:43] They had to deal with this sin because
[1:58:45] just like Achen stealing the golden
[1:58:47] wedge, they learned those lessons and
[1:58:49] they knew that if there was sin in the
[1:58:50] camp, it has to be deal dealt with one
[1:58:52] way or the other. So they were they were
[1:58:56] determined because of this sin, you need
[1:58:59] to send those perpetrators over here,
[1:59:01] the murderers over here or if not
[1:59:03] there's going to be a war. It's going to
[1:59:04] be a civil war. Now this is a civil war
[1:59:06] because it's inside the tribes of
[1:59:07] Israel. This is not the Philistines and
[1:59:09] the Amorites. This is right inside the
[1:59:11] the camp of Israel. And it's a lesson
[1:59:14] here in a number of ways. And one of
[1:59:15] them is is that, you know, as a body of
[1:59:17] believers, you have a responsibility to
[1:59:20] keep the body clean so the Holy Spirit
[1:59:22] can move among us here. And when
[1:59:23] something rises up, we don't take the
[1:59:25] javelin and kill people. We rather deal
[1:59:28] with it by confession and repentance and
[1:59:30] making things right. Right.
[1:59:32] That's still that's still in force.
[1:59:34] That's still if we do something wrong,
[1:59:37] we should make it right. If we offend,
[1:59:38] we should ask for forgiveness. And those
[1:59:39] things are still in place. Principles
[1:59:41] are still true here.
[1:59:45] The Bible says, "And all the children of
[1:59:47] Israel went out and the congregation was
[1:59:50] gathered together as one man from Dan to
[1:59:52] Beeba." Whenever you see that phrase,
[1:59:54] Dan is in the north of Israel. Beers is
[1:59:56] in the south. So they gathered all the
[1:59:58] tribes together within the land of
[2:00:00] Gilead unto the Lord in Mispa. That's
[2:00:03] where they met. And the chief of all the
[2:00:06] people, even of all the tribes of
[2:00:08] Israel, presented themselves in the
[2:00:09] assembly of the people of God, 400,
[2:00:13] notice the numbers, 400,000
[2:00:16] footmen
[2:00:18] that drew sword. Now the children of
[2:00:20] Benjamin heard that the children of
[2:00:21] Israel were gone up to Misbah and then
[2:00:24] said the children of Israel, tell us how
[2:00:26] was this wickedness? And they wanted to
[2:00:29] know, they wanted to deal to deal with
[2:00:30] that. And the children of Benjamin, I'm
[2:00:34] reading in Judges 20, were numbered at
[2:00:37] that time of the out of the cities 20
[2:00:40] and 6,000 men that drew the sword
[2:00:43] besides the inhabitants of Gaba which
[2:00:45] were numbered 700
[2:00:48] chosen men. So now you have almost a
[2:00:51] half million men, a half a million men
[2:00:55] of the 11 tribes.
[2:00:58] And in Judges 2017, and the men of
[2:01:00] Israel besides Benjamin were numbered
[2:01:04] 400,000 men that drew sword, and all of
[2:01:07] these were men of war.
[2:01:10] So you have almost a half million
[2:01:13] soldiers
[2:01:15] against a group who were going against
[2:01:19] the the the last remaining tribe.
[2:01:24] And the children of Israel got up as was
[2:01:26] their custom. Listen now. As was their
[2:01:29] custom, they went up to the house of God
[2:01:31] before they went to battle. And they
[2:01:33] asked counsel of God and said, "Which of
[2:01:36] us will go up to fight in the battle
[2:01:38] against the children of Israel? Do you
[2:01:39] want us to go? Who goes first? What's
[2:01:41] the order of the battle?" And and the
[2:01:43] Lord responded and said, "Judas shall go
[2:01:45] up first. Go and fight the battle." So
[2:01:48] you have a half million men and you have
[2:01:51] uh you know just a smaller number. I
[2:01:53] think it was 22,000 men who were over
[2:01:55] here on the other side of the
[2:01:56] battlefield.
[2:01:58] And they go to God and they say, "Shall
[2:02:00] we go?" God says, "Go. Put Judah up in
[2:02:02] front and off you go." And in the first
[2:02:05] day, the first day of the battle, asking
[2:02:09] God, "Should they go?" And God says,
[2:02:10] "Go,"
[2:02:13] this group
[2:02:15] suffers 22,,000 casualties
[2:02:20] and they retreat.
[2:02:24] Now, you got to wonder what went through
[2:02:25] the minds of all of those soldiers who
[2:02:27] were there. God told us to go. God told
[2:02:30] us to put Judah up front.
[2:02:33] He said to go into battle and we did.
[2:02:37] So, they come back home carrying
[2:02:40] 22,000 coffins.
[2:02:43] Think about it. 22,000 coffins. and they
[2:02:47] come back to the land, the camp, and at
[2:02:49] the end of the day, they bury all of
[2:02:51] these soldiers who are dead.
[2:02:54] They're thinking, "Wow, we're the people
[2:02:55] of God. We're the 11 tribes. We're We
[2:02:58] haven't committed any wrong.
[2:03:01] We haven't murdered anybody.
[2:03:04] And we just held 22,000
[2:03:07] funerals
[2:03:09] at the end of our day."
[2:03:13] Let me ask you a question. Would you go
[2:03:14] back tomorrow?
[2:03:17] I mean,
[2:03:20] you'd have to think.
[2:03:23] Second day. And the people of Israel
[2:03:25] encouraged themselves, and they set the
[2:03:28] battle in array, in a place where they
[2:03:29] put themselves in array the first day.
[2:03:32] And the children of Israel went up and
[2:03:33] wept before the Lord until even and
[2:03:36] asked counsel of the Lord, saying,
[2:03:38] "Shall I go up again to battle against
[2:03:41] the children of Benjamin?" And the Lord
[2:03:43] said, "Go up. Go up against them. Go for
[2:03:47] it.
[2:03:49] Absolutely. Yes. Go for it."
[2:03:55] And the children of Israel and all the
[2:03:57] people went up
[2:04:00] and came unto the house of God. Sorry,
[2:04:01] I'm jumping ahead of myself. And in that
[2:04:05] battle, and I'm skipping some of the
[2:04:06] scriptures just for time, but in this
[2:04:09] battle, 18,000 soldiers die
[2:04:15] and they lose the battle the second day.
[2:04:22] So the first day they lose 20 thou
[2:04:24] 22,000 people. The second day they lose
[2:04:26] 18,000 people. That's 40,000 funerals
[2:04:29] they've done in 48 hours.
[2:04:33] Let me ask you a question again. How
[2:04:35] would you feel about going up the third
[2:04:37] day
[2:04:40] and all of you are kind of uncomfortably
[2:04:42] quiet because you're thinking, "How far
[2:04:46] does this obedience thing go?"
[2:04:50] Good question.
[2:04:52] And the Bible says, I'm still in Judges
[2:04:55] 20, and the children of Israel and all
[2:04:56] the people went up and came to the house
[2:04:58] of God and wept. That's probably an
[2:04:59] understatement.
[2:05:01] and sat there before the Lord and fasted
[2:05:04] that day until even and offered burnt
[2:05:05] offerings and peace offerings before the
[2:05:08] Lord. And the children of Israel
[2:05:10] inquired of the Lord for the ark of the
[2:05:11] covenant of God was there in those days.
[2:05:13] And Phineas, the son of Eleazar, the son
[2:05:15] of Aaron, who stood before it in those
[2:05:18] days,
[2:05:20] shall I go again out to battle against?
[2:05:23] Hey, these guys are in the will of God,
[2:05:26] right? God is they're asking God. God's
[2:05:28] saying go, they go. They're they're
[2:05:30] being obedient.
[2:05:32] Shall I yet go again to battle against
[2:05:35] the children of Benjamin, my brother, or
[2:05:36] shall I cease?
[2:05:40] I mean, if you were a captain of a
[2:05:41] thousand men there, you're
[2:05:45] just buried. The the ground is still
[2:05:48] fresh on 40,000
[2:05:50] graves.
[2:05:52] Shall I go again?
[2:05:55] And God says, "Go up,
[2:05:58] but tomorrow I'll deliver them into your
[2:05:59] hand."
[2:06:02] Would you be willing to go on that third
[2:06:03] day?
[2:06:05] 40,000 people, probably everybody in the
[2:06:08] camp knew somebody who was now in a
[2:06:10] grave somewhere.
[2:06:12] Every family practically in the tribe of
[2:06:14] in the whole land of Israel knew
[2:06:16] somebody who was buried up on that hill.
[2:06:18] And here they are. And God says, "On the
[2:06:20] third day, go up."
[2:06:24] And you know what the people did?
[2:06:27] They obeyed God.
[2:06:29] And they went.
[2:06:31] And when they went
[2:06:34] and obeyed what the Lord says,
[2:06:37] they were victorious.
[2:06:43] Brother Ram said, "And Abraham believed
[2:06:45] it." And he said, "That's a believer.
[2:06:47] That's a believer when he just believes
[2:06:49] God. How are you going to do it, Lord?"
[2:06:50] He never asked the question. God said he
[2:06:53] would do it. That's settled.
[2:06:57] You know what? You know what a believer
[2:06:59] does? A believer is characterized as
[2:07:00] somebody who hears here's what God says
[2:07:02] and obeys that. Doesn't ask a whole
[2:07:05] bunch of questions.
[2:07:07] Doesn't say, "But what about the other
[2:07:09] 40,000? But what about this and what
[2:07:11] about that?"
[2:07:13] Obedience is a powerful thing even when
[2:07:17] it's not logical.
[2:07:19] And I believe this, saints of God, with
[2:07:21] all my heart. I I I believe that when
[2:07:25] when it comes down to it, when it comes
[2:07:27] down to this place,
[2:07:30] what a promise of obedience, what a
[2:07:33] promise because of obedience. Obedience
[2:07:35] is what God wants. And it was once said,
[2:07:38] obedience is better than sacrifice. And
[2:07:40] to obey the Lord is better than any
[2:07:42] sacrifice that you could do.
[2:07:49] You say, "Well, you know, how far is God
[2:07:51] going to go with this?" I don't know.
[2:07:53] I'm telling you, I don't know. But I
[2:07:55] know this about one of the charact when
[2:07:56] Peter asked the question, "What manner
[2:07:58] of people should we be?" And if
[2:08:01] obedience is one of those
[2:08:03] characteristics that are to be found in
[2:08:04] us, I say God's not afraid to push us to
[2:08:08] a limit that we may not expect or we may
[2:08:10] not fully understand. But you know what?
[2:08:13] You're better off being obedient because
[2:08:15] that's what God really wants.
[2:08:20] And brother Brandham tells us, and this
[2:08:21] is my last screen, he tells us, "Now
[2:08:24] you're going to see the glory of God."
[2:08:25] This is Joshua talking to the people,
[2:08:26] and they're hung the pillar of fire over
[2:08:28] them. But don't let it get out of your
[2:08:29] sight because you've never passed this
[2:08:31] way before. And I believe that's an
[2:08:33] experience for the church. Let's move
[2:08:34] out towards Jordan tonight because God's
[2:08:37] here leading you. And the angel of God
[2:08:38] will lead you every step of the way.
[2:08:42] You're not in the lead. You're not in
[2:08:44] control. You're not you're not going to
[2:08:46] uh decide or figure out the route
[2:08:48] yourself, but there's an angel here, the
[2:08:51] same kind of being that moved everything
[2:08:53] around in the first place. And that one
[2:08:55] is going to lead us in the last place
[2:08:57] all the way over onto the other side
[2:08:59] onto the other shore. And and that angel
[2:09:01] requires you to do one thing, and that
[2:09:03] is just to follow him. And where he says
[2:09:05] go, we'll go. And where he wants us to
[2:09:07] be, we'll be. And what he wants us to
[2:09:09] say, we'll say. And what he wants us to
[2:09:11] perform, we'll perform by God's grace
[2:09:14] because that's the will of God. God's
[2:09:16] will is to put an angel in front of us
[2:09:18] to lead us all the way. How many can say
[2:09:20] amen? God has got a design. God's got a
[2:09:22] program. God's got it already figured
[2:09:23] out. I know the plans concerning you and
[2:09:26] I know exactly where you need to be.
[2:09:28] Your job is to seek first the kingdom of
[2:09:30] God and say, "Lord, what your whatever
[2:09:32] is your will. That's my desire." And to
[2:09:35] follow him and obey him even when it
[2:09:37] doesn't make sense. And God is able and
[2:09:39] willing to do things in front of us that
[2:09:41] may not make a whole lot of sense, but
[2:09:43] he still wants you to obey it anyway.
[2:09:45] Let's stand to our feet.
[2:09:48] The angel of the Lord, he said God's
[2:09:50] here leading you, and the angel of the
[2:09:51] Lord will lead you every step of the
[2:09:55] way.
[2:09:58] Wow.
[2:10:01] rapturing faith
[2:10:05] for us to think, well, we just, you
[2:10:06] know, kind of walk off here and walk
[2:10:08] over the heads of all the denominational
[2:10:10] churches and so forth. Um, I I I I think
[2:10:13] folks, in the end of things, it'll
[2:10:15] probably be a little bit more
[2:10:16] challenging than that. But I know this
[2:10:18] that God never asks us to do anything
[2:10:22] that we would not be able to do because
[2:10:24] that would defeat God's purpose.
[2:10:26] But he puts within a seed everything
[2:10:28] that seed needs to become.
[2:10:31] He puts within that seed the power to
[2:10:33] become what it is supposed to be. And I
[2:10:35] believe that when God called us, he put
[2:10:37] within us everything that we need to
[2:10:39] have in order to go to where we need to
[2:10:41] go. Do you believe that today? God puts
[2:10:45] within us already everything that we
[2:10:47] have need of to get to where we need to
[2:10:49] go.
[2:10:51] Glory to God. He's good, isn't he?
[2:10:55] And his word is so challenging. I mean,
[2:10:57] his word is so powerful. And I I believe
[2:10:59] this that uh you know, when it when it
[2:11:01] came to uh Abraham getting to where he
[2:11:04] needed to be or any character in the
[2:11:05] Bible and you look at the three Hebrew
[2:11:07] children and all the rest of them, they
[2:11:09] all had a testimony that they just
[2:11:10] obeyed God. God made it happen. God
[2:11:13] brought it to pass. And even in the end,
[2:11:15] the unbelievers, the king is saying,
[2:11:17] "Hey, if we're going to worship a God,
[2:11:18] we're going to worship a God of these
[2:11:20] three right here because he's the God of
[2:11:22] all power."
[2:11:23] In our obedience, we have no fear. In
[2:11:25] our obedience, we have a trust in him.
[2:11:29] And faith and trust go hand in hand.
[2:11:32] Heavenly Father, as we bow into your
[2:11:34] presence, Lord, we're we're thankful for
[2:11:37] the sober reminders that are found in
[2:11:39] scripture how you're not afraid to
[2:11:41] challenge your people. You're not
[2:11:43] afraid, Lord, to present situations to
[2:11:46] them that may seem difficult and
[2:11:48] illogical, but you know exactly what
[2:11:51] you're doing. And I pray, dear God,
[2:11:53] you'd give us the same kind of faith and
[2:11:55] determination that those Israeli
[2:11:57] soldiers had, Lord, to to to pursue you
[2:12:01] despite all of the things that had
[2:12:03] happened to them over the last couple of
[2:12:04] days, they they pursued you still. They
[2:12:07] followed you and they obeyed you and
[2:12:08] they went back in the battle day after
[2:12:10] day knowing what had happened the day
[2:12:12] before and they were confident Lord.
[2:12:15] They were obedient. They were trusting
[2:12:16] in you. And I pray you'd make us give us
[2:12:18] that kind of a heart that we would
[2:12:20] follow you Lord no matter how sensible
[2:12:22] it is or how sensible it's not that you
[2:12:25] would give us a desire to follow you
[2:12:26] with a real heart full of courage and
[2:12:28] faith and believing Lord that you know
[2:12:30] best. I pray dear God you'd help us to
[2:12:33] pursue your presence in that same way.
[2:12:36] Have your way Lord. I pray give this
[2:12:39] church Lord. Give all of its members a
[2:12:41] real heart of a lion that they might
[2:12:43] pursue you Lord with a passion. And may
[2:12:46] Lord the leadership just lead your
[2:12:48] people with confidence knowing Lord that
[2:12:51] you're the one that moved us all into
[2:12:52] position and you have things under your
[2:12:54] control. We love you Lord and we thank
[2:12:57] you for your mercies. Help us Lord to
[2:13:00] have an obedient heart. In Jesus name we
[2:13:03] pray. In Jesus name we pray.
[2:13:07] Amen
[2:13:09] and amen.
[2:13:11] Let's sing. Let's worship before brother
[2:13:13] John come.
[2:13:16] Let's sing.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; You are great. Let's sing that. Pull
[2:13:25] that up there if you will.
[2:13:27] Let's worship together.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory
[2:13:36] and the honor.
[2:13:42] And Lord, we lift our hands
[2:13:47] to worship
[2:13:50] as we praise your holy
[2:13:54] name.
[2:13:56] We deserve the glory
[2:14:02] and we
[2:14:09] Lord we lift our hands
[2:14:13] to worship
[2:14:16] as we praise your holy name.
[2:14:21] For you are great.
[2:14:26] You do miracles
[2:14:29] so great.
[2:14:32] There is no one else like you.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, there is no one else like you. For
[2:14:47] you are great.
[2:14:51] You do miracles
[2:14:54] so great.
[2:14:58] There is no one else like you.
[2:15:07] There is no
[2:15:10] one
[2:15:11] else
[2:15:13] like
[2:15:14] you.
[2:15:19] And you deserve the gloryy
[2:15:26] and the honor.
[2:15:32] Lord, we lift our hands
[2:15:36] to worship
[2:15:39] as we praise your holy
[2:15:43] name.
[2:15:45] You deserve the gloryy
[2:15:47] [Music]
[2:15:51] and the honor.
[2:15:54] [Music]
[2:15:57] Lord, we lift our hands
[2:16:02] to worship
[2:16:04] as we praise your holy name. For you are
[2:16:11] great.
[2:16:14] You do miracles
[2:16:17] so great.
[2:16:20] There is no one else like you.
[2:16:28] Oh, there is no one else like you. For
[2:16:35] you are great.
[2:16:39] You do miracles
[2:16:42] so great.
[2:16:45] There is no one else like you.
[2:16:53] There is no
[2:16:56] one else
[2:16:59] like
[2:17:01] you. For you are great.
[2:17:08] Oh so great.
[2:17:12] There is no one else like you.
[2:17:21] There is no one else like you. For you
[2:17:28] are great.
[2:17:31] You do miracles
[2:17:34] so great.
[2:17:37] There is no one else like you.
[2:17:45] There is no
[2:17:48] one else
[2:17:51] like you.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we say praise the Lord this
[2:17:58] morning?
[2:17:59] Amen. That was beautiful.
[2:18:02] A bit of a walk down memory lane, I
[2:18:03] think.
[2:18:05] You know, I don't think when brother
[2:18:07] Mark first came out of the Catholic
[2:18:10] church that he thought a church would
[2:18:12] spring out of that decision or brother
[2:18:15] Bob, Sister Brenda, Sister Morin,
[2:18:16] Brother Barry, the different ones.
[2:18:18] Brother Gerald coming in. Who knew? Who
[2:18:20] knew what would come out of that? You
[2:18:22] know, it struck me that on the Exodus,
[2:18:24] not everyone was born in Egypt. Some of
[2:18:27] us were blessed to be born on the road.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't know Egypt. We don't know
[2:18:31] the price that was paid to get us out.
[2:18:33] But what matters is are we believe in
[2:18:35] the same message that brought them out
[2:18:37] of Egypt to take us into the promised
[2:18:39] land. Amen. We don't have to repent of
[2:18:41] Egypt, but we do have to stay faithful
[2:18:44] to the word. Amen. There's an obedience
[2:18:45] that's required for each one of us. But
[2:18:47] I so appreciate that that thought that
[2:18:49] we don't understand in the moment often
[2:18:52] what we're doing,
[2:18:54] the decisions we make, but if we make
[2:18:56] them by the word, later on we see the
[2:18:58] seed that we planted.
[2:19:03] Brother Mark, you see your seed.
[2:19:07] Brother Gerald, you see your seed.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Parents,
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; are you seeing the seed?
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; If you're not,
[2:19:19] it's not too late to change.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; But if you're seeing it, press the mark.
[2:19:24] Amen. Keep on the road.
[2:19:29] It's too late to be planting new crops.
[2:19:33] We ought to be nurturing them, building
[2:19:35] them up in the most holy faith. Amen.
[2:19:38] Stay true to what God's shown us.
[2:19:43] As long as the bride's here, there's
[2:19:45] still time, church. It's never too late.
[2:19:49] It's never too late to
[2:19:51] But don't wait until it's too late.
[2:19:54] Amen. We are this close.
[2:19:57] We're this close. Israel's God's time
[2:19:59] piece. They are one nation away from
[2:20:02] being alone in this world.
[2:20:04] And if we look at that, we say, "How
[2:20:06] much closer is the bride to going away?"
[2:20:09] Amen. I enjoy that today. Amen. There's
[2:20:13] a blessing in it, but there is a warning
[2:20:14] in it as well.
[2:20:16] Amen. I thought it was so good. If you
[2:20:18] don't like your crop, change your seed.
[2:20:21] Amen. God help us each one. But I as he
[2:20:26] was preaching there, the thought came to
[2:20:27] me when Jesus talks about that faithful
[2:20:29] servant that when the master comes, he
[2:20:32] finds him so doing what he told him to
[2:20:35] do. Amen. That's what obedience looks
[2:20:37] like. It's the faithful dayto-day walk
[2:20:40] of the humble, victorious Christian
[2:20:42] life. Amen. We're not here for fanfare.
[2:20:46] We're here to just do what he asked us
[2:20:48] to do.
[2:20:50] Nobody notices servants except when
[2:20:52] they're not doing their job.
[2:20:54] All he wants us to do is what he's asked
[2:20:56] us to do. And in the simple, humble,
[2:20:59] obedient life, that's where Christ is
[2:21:01] revealed in this age. Amen. We've been
[2:21:03] preaching on the mystery revealed. And
[2:21:05] then we have him come in and he he
[2:21:06] touches on a bunch of things that I was
[2:21:08] going to preach on. So, I don't know if
[2:21:09] I have to preach on some of them now,
[2:21:10] but I say, "Praise the Lord." It's good
[2:21:12] to have a an experienced minister come
[2:21:14] in behind and then confirm some of those
[2:21:16] things and and whatnot. It's an
[2:21:18] encouragement for me. Amen. To to hear
[2:21:20] and see those things as well. Amen. God
[2:21:22] bless you, Brother Barry. Sure.
[2:21:23] appreciated that. Amen. Let's sing that
[2:21:26] song. He's got it all in control. Amen.
[2:21:34] He's got it all
[2:21:37] in control.
[2:21:43] He's got it all
[2:21:46] in control.
[2:21:51] for he put that reassur
[2:21:56] way down in my soul.
[2:22:03] He's got it all in control.
[2:22:12] My father knows what I need.
[2:22:20] My father knows what I need.
[2:22:28] In everything I go through,
[2:22:32] he knows what's best for me.
[2:22:40] My father knows what I need.
[2:22:48] And I put my life in his hands.
[2:22:57] I put my life in his hand.
[2:23:04] So every road I walk down,
[2:23:09] I'm sure it's in his plan.
[2:23:16] I put my life in his hand. Let's sing
[2:23:20] that verse again.
[2:23:24] And I put my life in his hand.
[2:23:33] I put my life in his hand.
[2:23:40] So every road I walk down,
[2:23:45] I'm sure it's in his plan.
[2:23:48] [Music]
[2:23:52] I put my life in his hand.
[2:24:00] My father knows what I need.
[2:24:08] My father knows what I need.
[2:24:16] In everything I go through,
[2:24:20] he knows what's best for me.
[2:24:24] [Music]
[2:24:27] My father knows
[2:24:30] what I need.
[2:24:35] I know Jehovah's here.
[2:24:39] We start out slow and then we speed it
[2:24:41] up a bit, I think. Amen.
[2:24:54] Do we have the verses there?
[2:24:59] Are you okay for that?
[2:25:03] Okay. There we were in Egypt
[2:25:09] under Pharaoh's mighty hand.
[2:25:15] We were bound by wrong religion
[2:25:19] [Music]
[2:25:21] and caught in the creed of man.
[2:25:26] Oh, then a prophet from the desert
[2:25:32] starts preaching all around.
[2:25:38] God has heard our prayer.
[2:25:42] Jehovah
[2:25:43] has come down.
[2:25:49] I know Jehovah's
[2:25:52] here to lead us all the way.
[2:26:01] A pillar of fire
[2:26:04] by night
[2:26:08] and a cloud
[2:26:10] by day. I know Jehovah is here to lead
[2:26:18] us all the way.
[2:26:24] And I will follow everything
[2:26:29] he has to say. Second verse.
[2:26:37] Moses sure was no good speaker.
[2:26:43] Nothing polished I could tell.
[2:26:48] But we all began to notice
[2:26:54] that he knew Jehovah well.
[2:26:59] And as he stood behind the pulpit,
[2:27:06] showing signs of God's great power.
[2:27:11] It's Jehovah
[2:27:14] here. The message. Third verse. Third
[2:27:18] verse.
[2:27:22] I know Jehovah's
[2:27:25] here to lead us all the way.
[2:27:34] A pillar of fire
[2:27:37] by night
[2:27:40] and in the cloud
[2:27:43] by day. I know Jehovah's
[2:27:48] here to lead us all the way.
[2:27:57] And I will follow
[2:28:01] everything he has to say.
[2:28:08] And on the jour through the desert,
[2:28:15] about 30 miles high
[2:28:20] was a cloud that led us every day.
[2:28:26] And at night, a pillar of fire. Oh, if
[2:28:32] you ask for my opinion,
[2:28:38] All that I can say
[2:28:42] it's Jehovah
[2:28:45] here to lead us all the way.
[2:28:53] I know Jehovah was here to lead us all
[2:29:00] the way.
[2:29:05] The pillar of fire
[2:29:08] by night
[2:29:11] and the cloud
[2:29:14] by day. I know you hold us here to lead
[2:29:22] us all the way.
[2:29:28] and I will follow everything
[2:29:33] he has to say.
[2:29:39] I think we'll hold it there. Amen. God
[2:29:42] bless you. Before we close in prayer,
[2:29:44] we're going to sing that song, Jehovah
[2:29:45] Gyra, my provider. Amen. God bless each
[2:29:49] one for coming today. Amen. Trusting
[2:29:52] it's been a blessing. Amen. Pray God's
[2:29:54] grace as we go out. remember brother
[2:29:56] Dale Walsher in particular. Amen.
[2:29:58] There's a real need there. And we've
[2:30:00] been remembering every day in prayer at
[2:30:02] home and devotions and these things. But
[2:30:05] Amen. I'll tell you one thing. He needs
[2:30:06] deliverance. I say, Lord, deliver him
[2:30:09] from his pain one way or the other.
[2:30:11] Deliver him from his pain. Amen. Do a
[2:30:13] special work for him. Remember him.
[2:30:15] Remember brother Barry, Sister Becky as
[2:30:18] they travel home that God's grace would
[2:30:19] be with them. Amen. We've got a lot
[2:30:21] going on this month. It's a busy month
[2:30:23] for me and my family as well. So just
[2:30:25] praying God's grace for us through that.
[2:30:27] Children back in school. Jonathan starts
[2:30:29] university on Monday and uh Monday,
[2:30:32] right? So we want to remember him as
[2:30:34] well. It's a big bad world out there.
[2:30:37] Amen. Just trusting God to put a hedge
[2:30:39] of protection about him that he'd be a
[2:30:40] light in perhaps the darkest place you
[2:30:44] can find in St. John's, Newfoundland is
[2:30:45] the campus of a university. Amen. So
[2:30:48] trusting God will be with them there.
[2:30:50] Amen. Let's sing this. And uh brother
[2:30:52] Vasha, I'm going to have you close in
[2:30:53] prayer if that'd be okay. Amen. God
[2:30:55] bless you.
[2:30:57] Jehovah
[2:31:00] Gyra
[2:31:05] my proer.
[2:31:08] [Music]
[2:31:12] You are more
[2:31:16] than enough
[2:31:20] for me.

[2:31:46] set

[2:32:02] me.

[2:32:18] You are more
[2:32:22] than enough.
[2:32:27] More
[2:32:28] than enough.
[2:32:32] You are more
[2:32:35] than enough
[2:32:39] for me. One more time.

[2:32:46] Gyra
[2:32:49] [Music]
[2:32:51] my proider.
[2:32:58] You are more
