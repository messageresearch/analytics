your people we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Psalms chapter 16. thank our lone musician today for going it alone amen God bless her amen we also welcome sister Kimberly and young Master Wesley with us amen back to church for the first time since the birth so we're good to see them and of course brother Paul with them amen a couple things couple quick announcements so I I announced different dates for the different meetings coming up and I was right about brother Tim Pruitt's but I was wrong on brother Andrew Glover so our camp dates are August 25th through August 27th so just to clarify that and brother Paul has added a calendar on the Church website now so that'll have special services and cancellations and those things so if you have people asking about church services and when they can come just say you know here are the times but check the calendar to make sure that there is a service that day you know with some of the work we're doing and cancellations for special meetings and and things like that so that's there now of course we've got brother Barry coffee on Wednesday Lord willing so we're looking forward to that keep him in prayer amen and then thankful to the trustees and brother Matt and all the helpers that managed to get the carpet in in a single week and it certainly looks wonderful amen it's uh it just looks fantastic so thank you for the hard work you did there for the Dale brother Bob brother Mark their spouses brother Matt the helpers each one that came out and and put their shoulder to the wheel amen it's good to it's good to be here good to see the changes and and the improvements that are made hey man let's turn to the scripture Psalm chapter 16. Psalm chapter 16 verse 7 says I will bless the Lord who hath given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the ninth season notice there it says my Reigns instruct me Reigns are for a horse it says my Reigns instruct me means somebody else directs me in the night season when I can't see it there's one that gives me direction there was one that that shows me the path there's one that makes it clear which way I should go even when I don't know which way to go there's something that's instructing me when what I have fails me it says I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices my flesh flesh also shall Rest In Hope amen God bless you can have your seats may God bless the reading of his word and I'm taking a bit of a detour today and we're still on that thought of her day and brother Matt for the vice I've got a fair bit of uh rebound coming up here if we can tune that out a bit but um taking a bit of a detour here and I've been dwelling on this thought for quite some time and I've talked to my wife about and I've talked to a few different ones about this is coming this is coming and and just sharing some of the things that the Lord's put on my heart but we're still on that that thought of redemption but we're gonna just stop for a point here and I want to preach on this this title I shall not be moved and this this sock came to me as we are preaching on the adoption of the children of God and we looked at Jesus life on Earth and and we we saw his adoption on Mount Transfiguration we know that there was a shift in his ministry after that thank you brothers that there's a shift in his ministry after that and I just want to touch on this as a a starting point to set a foundation for the service this morning and in Luke chapter 9 it says and it came to pass about an eight days after these Saints he took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and and his raiment was white and glistening and behold there talked with him two men which were Moses and Elias who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem and I noticed there it says that he should accomplish I jumped over to the Amplified there and it says they were speaking of his exit from Life which he was about to bring to realization at Jerusalem and I want to dwell on that thought for a bit because if you see the meaning there it's not just something that's going to occur and I think that's something we have to realize is when we're stepping into the word it's not just something that's going to occur because the word said it but there's a portion for us to play and as Moses and Elijah are talking with Jesus what happens is they're saying this is what you have to do it's not just because the word is written but you've got to do it you've got to make a choice you've got to step into this and there's a path you've got to take and you're going to bring to pass what's going to happen as it was written in the word so Jesus wasn't just standing around and events were happening but he had to step into it he had this he had to turn his face towards Jerusalem he had to now start to put into action the word that was given him he had to put into action the purpose that was prepared for him to go into what was expected by him and we see that virtually immediately after this he does something very interesting and in Luke this is just a few verses later it says and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up pointing to his Ascension it says he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem in other words he turned from everything that he had been doing and he set his face and he said his feet and he was going now to Jerusalem to fulfill the final portion of his Ministry now in most of the gospels they don't talk a whole lot about what he did after this because it almost goes immediately to the Passover and the preparation for it and these different things but in the Book of Luke we have chapter after chapter of what he did there because remember the voice said hear ye him that meant there was something that he had to say it meant that there was a Ministry that had to occur after his male Transfiguration experience after his adoption and his journey would take him we see in Luke through many many villages on his way to Jerusalem he's here and he's got to go here to Jerusalem but in between there's a bunch of dots that have to be touched and we see that what happens here is he sends out Messengers ahead of him to let the villagers know I'm coming because as he's going on the path to Jerusalem he's going to stop and he's going to touch a life here and he's going to touch a life there and he's going to preach here and he's going to preach there and many of those Villages received him but we see that what happens he comes to a village in Samaria and they look at him and because he is acting as if he's going on they say we don't want you to come in in the first place he sent Messengers he sent a way that was prepared and he's letting them know he's coming but because of their complexes because they were in Samaria and this was a place of mixed people they had a complex perhaps they they had been turned down by the prophets they have been ignored by the ministry and so he comes along and because his focus is to move on they say well you don't stop here then you're just like the rest of them perhaps you're just going to the Jews you don't have any time for us in Samaria but he had sent Messengers saying I'm going to stop on my way through it reminds me when brother Aaron Oglesby was here and I don't know if he said it over the pulpit or if he was talking in private but he talks about that woman who had the blood issue if you remember and what happened was Jesus was on his way to Jairus daughter Jesus face was set towards jairus's daughter but on the way that woman's Faith stopped him in his tracks and she was healed why because on the bay on his his path to where he was going he had enough love and compassion to respond to somebody that was on the way what I'm saying is sometimes we get so caught up in our mission for today that we don't take time to stop and help somebody that's right along the path amen sometimes we're so focused on what we're doing and what we're supposed to be doing and we don't stop and say is there someone I can help along the way but Jesus even though his face was set steadfastly towards Jerusalem to go to his death to go to the whipping post to go to his trial and all these things yet along the way he stopped to help the people that were there but their complex stopped them from getting a blessing that day because he stopped he was prepared to preach he was prepared to talk he was prepared to to share his ministry with them we're talking on the side of I shall not be moved and and my point here is that though you are focused on what you're supposed to be doing don't forget our biggest our biggest purpose is to spread the gospel amen we're here to preach the gospel we're here to live a gospel and let's not be so caught up in our in our religion if I could put it that way right that we forget that we are here to share a gospel with people along the way and no matter how busy we are no matter how tired we are no matter that we're looking to make a resurrection and a Rapture let's make sure we stop along the way to help the people that are in need along our life's path amen God puts people that have needs in our path so that we can be the ones that can help to meet it that's why he puts people there so that we can do something for them that nobody can can do for them amen but there's a as Jesus is heading to his his crowning achievement which is his his death burial and Resurrection I want to to poke or to point out the steadfastness the immovability of him in these last few days because it's something I want to unpack for us a bit this today and and maybe even over the next few Services if the Lord would will but we go to the Garden of the Gethsemane and Jesus has spent the evening in prayer and he's gone and he said Lord if this if it's possible let this cup pass for me if it let it pass let it pass I really don't want to do this and then at the end he says but nevertheless not my will but thine be done and he surrenders himself to it and once he surrenders he goes back and he's with the disciples and then remember that Judas comes up with the the the soldiers from the priesthood and and the the different ones and he comes up and he betrays Jesus with a kiss and then it wakes everybody up and we see a a scene here because Peter gets into a bit of a kerfuffle and in Matthew 26 it says and behold one of them which were with Jesus that's Peter stretched out his hand and Drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear he cut off his ear he wasn't aiming for his ear I can tell you that and then said Jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all that take the sword Shall Perish with the sword now listen to Jesus his thought process his mind here he says thinketh thou that I cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than 12 Legions of angels He says but then how shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be so Peter Jesus tells Peter he says Peter you don't understand what's going on in here they're not taking me I'm giving me he says don't you realize that if I pray for it 12 Legions of angels could come here they could wipe them all out and I could walk free I am not being bound because they just choose it I'm being bound because I choose it I'm giving myself to them I'm letting it be and he says Peter if you're successful in your fight then the word won't be accomplished so put your sword away so that my portion of the word can be fulfilled don't interfere with my walk that's what he's saying Peter don't interfere with my walk what's got to be has got to be so don't get all full of zeal here to take it away God has put this God has put me in this position to fulfill his word so don't stop my trial don't stop my arrest don't stop this hard thing that I'm about to go to why because he had surrendered his will he didn't need Peter's help he didn't need Peter's help he was on his own path and God had already told him what he was going to do Moses and Elisha our Elijah had already told him what was going to happen and so he said I'm putting myself into what God has ordained for me in this thing I'm stepping into the word not only that he says I'm pressing into it that's what he's doing he's pressing into it he's putting his own body on the line he's putting his life on the line because that was his role for that time in the Kingdom then they take him into the Hall of judgment and they accuse him of many false things we know and in Matthew 26 just to lay a foundation that says now the chief priests and elders and all the councils sought false Witnesses against Jesus to put him to death but found none now notice this it says yea though many false Witnesses came yet found a nun in other words they couldn't get two false witnesses to agree with each other you talk about a kangaroo court you talk about a pretended to death they couldn't even find two people to lie the same way that's how bad it was church if it was us we'd be sitting there in that Hall and as soon as we realized what was going on and we'd say now he just contradicted him and she's not matching up with what he said and we'd have Twisted them up in their words and we just said and now you've got to let us go free we'd have fought back we'd have used their their own testimony against them to prove what was in their hearts but Jesus didn't do that it said at the last came two false Witnesses and said this fellow said I'm able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days and the high priest arose and said unto him answers thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee it says but Jesus held his peace nothing that they said was was factually true nothing that they said was representative of what he said it was twisted at best or else it was completely false other than that but they said he stood there and they falsely accused him and they slandered him and they tried to tear his reputation down and do all these things and yet Jesus answered nothing amen why because he was steadfast in his purpose he was steadfast in his position he would steadfast in what the word said about him that he didn't need to answer anything because he knew this had to happen for his portion of the word to be fulfilled what was he saying I won't be moved by what you do I won't be moved by what you say I won't be moved by how you lie how you twist things against me he wasn't worried about what they had to say because it was all apart and parcel of his journey if we read in Isaiah 53 it says he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living and for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth church sometimes we speak the word we share the word we stand on the word and people are going to say things about us people are going to Harbor feelings towards us people are going to twist our motives and objectives they're going to assign things to us that have nothing to do with what's in our heart and we've got to be able to stand there and say I shall not be moved I don't care what people say I don't care what people think I don't care what people put on social media I don't care how they cut me I don't care how they cut me off I don't care if they disfellowship I'm going to stay with what the word says and that's what Christ was doing but not only what the word says but what the word said about him because that's why he was silent was because the word said you've got to stay silent amen amen we've got to be standing firmly on our word you've got to have a word for where you're at in each situation with each relationship you have with each person you've got to be able to stay this is where I'm standing right now and it's on his word and it's written about me and for me for the situation amen we've got to be able to stand firmly because everything in this world is against us now you might think well there's there's people that are that are on the right side and they're on the conservative side no no no church they're not with us they're only with us in a little bit and their motive is completely different than our motive and their morality is completely different than ours and their purpose for even believing and saying the things that they do is completely different than ours we'll maybe touch on that a little bit later but why did Jesus not speak we say well he was he was fulfilling the word and he was doing what he had been told to him but I want you to understand that there's an overarching reason for all of this and that is love he stayed silent out of love because this whole thing this whole thing of redemption this whole process of redemption is a love process and so he stood there and he he held his mouth quiet he had he stayed quiet now listen he had a gift of discernment he had an open Vision Ministry he knew the thoughts of them he could have gone there and he could have torn them all to shambles he could have showed exactly what was going on he could have said now you met with this one in this room and you talked about this one and you witnessed you came from this place and they paid you this much money to do this and that and the other thing and he could have he could have revealed the whole kangaroo court that was going on there but yet love kept his mouth shut he could have completely tied them in knots he could have completely exposed them but love kept his mouth shut that's what kept Him in a place where he would take a beating where he would take a whipping where he would stand still while they would press those Thorns down into his head while they would slap him while they would punch him in the face it was love that kept his mouth quiet it was love that kept him standing it was love that kept him from calling on those 12 Legions of angels even before the governor a man that had nothing to do with this a man that wasn't persecuting him he stayed quiet and we read about in Matthew 27 it says and Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the king of the Jews and Jesus said unto him thou sayest and when he was accused of the chief priests and Elders he answered nothing then said pilate unto him here's thou not how many things they have witnessed against thee it says and he never answered him and he answered to him never a word in so much that the governor Marvel greatly love kept his mouth shut church love kept him bound to that place love kept him from offering a defense love kept him headed towards the whipping post where he paid for our healing love kept him standing in that place while they said everything about him that wasn't true love kept him there even it's amazing to me that in that moment the clarity of Jesus mind because remember pilate would say don't you know that that I can kill you and he says you don't have any power except God gave it to you I'm not scared of you I'm not scared of your response so when we're standing in the word when somebody tries to do something to us then what are we worried about they have no power of us over US unless God would give it to them they have no influence over US unless God will give it to them and so we can stand there in assurance that we're in what his perfect will and his love is what's going to keep us standing there and taking whatever it is that comes our way church he went there and they didn't have to hold his his arms down with their knees on it when they pounded them into the cross why love love nailed those hands to the Cross he laid them willingly there and he didn't move them as they drove those Nails into the cross that was his overarching reason for other this why am I saying this church because as he loved we must love and we stand on the word and we speak the word but our reasons for doing it always have to be in love I shall not be moved from his love I shall not be removed and step into my own flesh and step into my own reason these different things when we're standing on the word of God we're standing on it out of love and when we say what we say and do what we do love has to be the reason that we're doing it and I'm going to get into this a little bit because we can get these things twisted around amen our our position our immovability our unwillingness to move from the word of God is on the basis of love our greatest attribute therefore is that we love someone and we do it by staying with the word the greatest love you can show somebody is to stay with the word of God Amen we hold fast in love always but we get it twisted and I want you to catch us today because we can get into this place where we say well the word says such and such and and that's what I'm going to do but what happens when we do that is we get our backs up and we get into a defensive mode because we know that often a battle is coming and we know that maybe we're going to be rejected and we know that somebody's going to disagree with us or somebody's not going to like us after we stand on the word and so we go into it with our Shields up and our backs stiff and our weapon out and that's not the way Jesus did it he didn't go in there all backed up and ready for a fight but he went in willing to absorb the abuse that came with standing on the word in love amen when our motive is love we can stand on the word and we're doing it for the sake of the person in front of us it's for their reason it's for their good that we're doing these things we don't do it for ourselves we stand on the word because we believe it but we stand on the word for the sake of the person that's in front of us that's hearing us that's watching us live whatever it might be amen he sent a word to us and it's not just a word on pages and it's not just a word in print but it's a Living Word and we live that word out of love in hopes that somebody else will catch the love of God that's coming out of our Lives amen our attitude so often and this is our downfalling is determined by our our feelings and our anticipation of what's about to happen and so we go into this and we stand on the word of God and we hold the fast or we hold fast of what we've been taught and when we refuse to to compromise we get into that defensive mode and we know that battle's coming in we know we're going to pay a price for following the leadership of the Holy Spirit as it quickens his word to us and what we get those Shields up and we're preparing for the battle rather than being willing to absorb the damage there's a price that we pay for living this word church what is it we can be standing on the word of God and have a completely wrong attitude in anticipation of being rejected how many of us have talked to somebody have witnessed and gone into it and said no I'm pretty sure they're going to accept this it's not a common thing is it and so after rejection after rejection after rejection what happens is we tend to get into this mode where we're just well we're almost like here's what the word says and we got a shield here and a sword there and our backs are up and the people can see that we're not really presenting this in love because we're too stressed out we're too nervous about what's going to happen and that's not the way the gospel is going to be affected amen Jesus is standing in the hall of judgment and given the opportunity to defend himself he stays silent and love keeps him silent to absorb the abuse of everyone that's coming against him why he knew who he was he knew who he was church there are there's a couple men that I've met in my life and and I don't mind naming them brother philma rugby some of you would know him from Calvary wonderful colored brother and he was the calmest coolest most collected Christian I believe I've ever met and you could be yelling at him and not that I did but he dealt with people in such a way that they could be so worked up and so angry and so stressed and he'd just sit there and he'd stand there and he could talk them through it and he never moved why because he was so convinced of where he was standing was on the word of God that what they said had nothing that would impact him that's where Christ was he was standing there he knew who he was he knew he where he where he was supposed to be and because he was in the will of God he couldn't have any doubts about it all the doubts had disappeared fear couldn't enter because there was no doubt there he was standing there fully in faith amen and in that place of Faith he was full of love he was full of compassion and he could take everything that they threw his way and all he all they would have seen was a gentle acceptance that you don't even realize what you're doing but I know what I'm doing and so because I know what I'm doing I'm able to accept what's going on in this situation even on the cross his words were father forgive them they know not what they do that's the kind of love we're talking about when when we won't be moved from the word they were crucifying their hope they were crucifying their God they were crucifying the very Messiah their very hopes and dreams and anticipation was on the cross and they were doing it and yet he said father forgive them what was he he was refusing to be moved from the word in love and he said don't hold it to their account they had to do this we know they had to do it so don't charge it to their account let it go this time very familiar scripture in first John 4 says there is no fear in love no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear had torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he had seen how can he love God whom he had not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also I want to start with that first portion that says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear and say this a decision made out of fear is never ever a Godly decision if you are making a decision if you have made a decision if you're about to make a decision out of fear out of worry about concern of what will happen otherwise then it is not a Godly decision even if you've made it on the word of God because fear taints fear brings in a desire to control to mitigate to put something off see and it taints it and where fear is Faith Can't Be so the minute you introduce fear then faith has gone out the door and so fear taints the decision and it will take you off the word of God just that little smidge and God can't honor it because it's not a Godly decision amen because fear brings compromise every single time every single time if you're scared you'll compromise amen if you're scared something will happen you're going to be off the word of God because a Godly decision decision is always made in faith not in fear and I want to flesh this out a bit I want to spend a bit of time on this because when push comes to shove we can stand on the word all day long but we need to check our motive we need to check our objective we need to check our attitude as we go into these things otherwise Satan can get in and he can infect it just with those three little things I want to take us back to a well-known story and this is the story the Rich Young Ruler in Mark chapter 10 and Jesus is talk this man comes to talk to Jesus and he has an opportunity now to share the gospel it says and when he was gone forth into the way there come one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there's none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth he's a good man we meet people like this don't we you can go around the world and you'll meet them and and some of them are professing Christians and some of them aren't but they lead what we would call good lives they they have good morals they they they they they're they're careful they're considerate they're compassionate in all these things but that's not what's going to get us eternal life it's not what's going to do we'll read a quote later that talks about this but Watch What Happens here because we're talking about I shall not be moved and we're talking about I shall not be moved under the the rainbow of love if I could put it that way it says then Jesus beholding him loved him now Church what would love look like to most of the world do you think in this situation because God's love is not the same as as the world's love and God's love is not the same as natural love so I want you to catch here that as this is going to be love projecting this is God's love projecting and watch how this love is shown because we want to bring it down to where we live at today it says and Jesus beholding him loved him and said love have words it said one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions and Jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they which have riches enter into the kingdom of God Church what did love look like that day love was not an affirming love that day was it love was the word made flesh telling that man what he needed to know that's what love looked like that day the word was standing in flesh and the word in love gave him directly the answer that he was seeking for his life it's so easy to compromise in these type of situations church because we're dealing with people often that have good intentions that have a good attitude that are open to conversation that are open to witness and often the first thing they do is they bring I have done this and I have done that and I'm here and I'm there and this is what I'm doing with my money and this is what I do with my church or this is what I do with my family and what is so easy to do there is to sit there and affirm what they've done and leave it at that but Jesus doesn't do that to this young man notice Jesus doesn't take away his witness Jesus doesn't take away his testimony his own testimony of his own life amen he didn't beat him over the head with his answer he didn't punch him between the eyes he didn't preach a fire and brimstone service he just said one thing you lack just one thing charged if he could ever say there's only one thing I'm missing I'd be happy but the thing is when he tells me what it is will I take it because it's hard because usually the thing we lack is the greatest thing that we are holding on to ourselves just like this young man did amen love said one thing thou lackest love went to the need love went to the root of the problem straight to it and it told him the truth it told him the truth and I don't think I have it in in my in my quotes here but I had it and I took it out I know where brother Brown said the holy spirit will tell the truth on you the holy spirit will get to the root of the issue the holy spirit will come right down and touch that point in my life that needs to be fixed he doesn't pull punches but he does it in love and whether it comes over this Pulpit whether it comes in devotions whether it comes to a spouse a brother or sister in this church it will come in love because it will not be compromised by what you're going to feel with that truth now that young man was a good young man he was a ruler he was a man of prestige he was a man that was recognized in that time but we're preaching on love shall not be moved and we see here that love does not change based on the receiver the truth doesn't change based on the receiver we're dealing with people sometimes and the truth is literally 180 degrees opposite of what that person believes or has been taught or these different things but if we compromise because of what we are worried about they're going to do then what we have is natural love not godly love because natural love will compromise every time what is it trying to hold on to the relationship trying to hold on to the connection trying to hold on to catch this trying to hold on to the opportunity to continue to witness to them down the road sometimes what happens is we're looking for the second opportunity so we compromise the first Jesus never did that the apostles never did that you come with a question they'll give you the answer and they'll give it to you with the full word not just the part of the word amen sometimes what happens is we want to soften the impact we want to soften the impact we don't want the person to get their back up and so we back off on the truth a little bit we round off the sharp edges Church the word is a double-edged sword it cuts going and it cuts coming back but it does it clean I may have told this story before when I was in Texas working with Halliburton on a co-op work term and I was doing some electrical work which was my first mistake but I was working and I was cutting some conduit and it was up in the air like this and I was again second mistake I was cutting it with a brand new exacto knife and it's this this uh this this this uh plastic um uh you know conduit for for wiring and I went and I was cutting and I was cutting and I was almost through and I pushed hard and it went through and it sliced right into right into the the palm of my hand and I've bled for 150 feet it took me all on the floor to get to the first aid station 150 feet just blood gushing out of that hand but it didn't hurt and it took him about a they took me from there took me to the nurse from a nurse to a doctor which was about two hours later perhaps and and the doctor came in and he shot it full of needles and he stitched it up but before I did it I said doc it doesn't hurt I said is there something wrong did I cut a nerve he said well what did you cut it with I said I cut it with an X-Acto Knife he says was it a new blade or was it an old blade I said it was brand new I just taken it out of the package he says it'll never hurt he says it's a perfect cut he says because a perfect blade doesn't tear he says it's tearing that causes pain and muscle he says but when you have a something like a scalpel he says it doesn't hurt because it cuts it so perfectly that it can join right back up together again that's the way the word works you know you've been cut but the pain doesn't come with it because it does it so perfectly but what happens you take something away from that word what does it do it puts a burr on the edge The Edge is not perfect anymore and so now when you cut you actually hurt them worse than if you gave them it the raw truth with the full Cutting Edge of that word amen what is it this world hates absolutes have you noticed that this world doesn't like an absolute answer and when someone asks us a question we have an absolute we have an absolute and it's right here so I can quote from this and get serpent seed is the litmus test that's not what we're supposed to be doing going around making it as difficult as possible for people but when they ask and answer give them ask a question give them the full word answer that's all give them the full word we have a full word we have an open Word and it was for rapturing Faith it was to get us off this Earth so let's give them a full word answer let's not pull our punches because we're scared we're going to hurt them but if we can do it in love they'll see it's in love and they'll see the sincerity of our hearts they'll see our attitude and they'll be able to accept these things out of us amen the truth doesn't delude itself to make it palatable ever and that's what we see today is a is the nature of compromise trying to make this gospel palatable and the more you you look around and see what's going on in churches these days the more you see they're trying to make it palatable they're trying to make you comfortable with where you're at and the real word is the most uncomfortable thing you'll ever experience because it takes you from where you are to where God wants you to be and that's an uncomfortable place because it's always resting on faith we don't have our our thing anymore but the basis for the Christian walk is always faith that means you've got to walk out like Abraham not knowing where I'm going that's not comfortable like I said the greatest compromise we have is when we seek the answer we have rather than the answer in the word of God and why do we do that because we don't want to let go because we're fearful we're fearful we're fearful of the response we're fearful of of undoing something we've already done many times if we were to be honest with ourselves we fear the consequences of a word decision We Fear the rejection of those that are going to be impacted by it especially if we've made the wrong decision before this and then compromise in the past is the hardest thing to correct today if I've compromised in my life if I've compromised in my home if I've compromised in my family then that compromise has produced fruit and if I go back and I finally take the word in its fullness and now apply it to my home what do I have to deal with all the vines of compromise that have grown in my home and that's the hardest thing is to stand there and say Daddy was wrong Daddy was wrong daddy didn't take the full word or daddy liked it daddy liked it but Daddy don't like it no more and we have to Humble ourselves and it takes Grace for us and from us to go in and rip out those roots of compromise that we have in our own lives what to go in and say I shouldn't have done it shouldn't have allowed it shouldn't have brought it in the house shouldn't have said it shouldn't have given you this it was my fault I'm responsible for it I've had to do it in my own family no doubt I'll have to do it again where we let things in unsupervised where we gave way just for a moment just for a day and the next day it's a little bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more what is it that compromise gets there and it starts to starts to grow in our lives the famous dandelions I've talked about they're foot and a half tall in some place on my lawn and I only molded on on Wednesday night they grow so fast compromise grows so fast and it infects everything inside of our life usually the things we're fighting are because of a compromise we let something in just a little bit and it grows into a big thing and then we wonder how did that get in it was a little compromise a week or two ago or a month ago or a year ago in some cases we've got to be able to say I moved off the word but now I'm coming back to the word and I'm not going to be moved from it I shall not be moved from this and if I got to make things right I'll make things right now if I got to bow down and I've got to repent and I'll repent now if I've got to make myself small and humble myself I'll do it otherwise what compromise will continue to grow and it starts to get into every aspect of your life because you'll fill one room and then he'll grow into the next and then he'll grow into the next and he'll grow into the next we've got to root it out but I want to take it even beyond that because Jesus example was in love for what to pass it on to us it was to be shed abroad it was to be shared with others amen we've got to start in our own life because we can't give what we don't have you know how hard it is to testify to somebody about a compromise you made you can't talk to somebody about well we don't have TVs when you just told them you watched a movie yesterday can you because I say well how does that work you don't have a TV but you watch movies and you've got no ground to stand on well we don't do this and we don't do that but but I just saw you there yesterday you've got to get it clear in your life before you can give it to somebody else amen you got to straighten up your life you've got to make sure that the whole word is operating in your life before you can give it to somebody else because otherwise they'll see through the hypocrisy which is what it is they'll see through the hypocrisy right in an instant the world is great at seeing hypocrites they lack Grace though but they'll catch us out every single time but we've got to be able to say I'm standing immovable on the word of God in my life but once we have that look at this first Corinthians 13. though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I can remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing now I want you to notice this because Paul is pointing out to things that we would say I have I have a gift of Prophecy I understand all Mysteries I have all knowledge I have all faith so these are attributes these are characteristics that you could say I have or I am so he says if you don't have love and you am all those things he says you are nothing but Paul says I am nothing I like how he says it about himself let's not put it on the person next to us if I don't have it I am nothing I'm not worried about brother Josh I'm worried about me because I got to get it for me before I can ever do a thing for brother Josh and brother Josh can only do it for me once he's got it for himself amen he says I am nothing but watch now we transitions in verse 3 and says and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing so now we're into works because some people don't have a whole lot but they'll say I do a lot and I pay my tithes and I give to to these things and I go to to this place and I help with the orphans and I go do meals at the the the food bank and these different things and I do all these things and Paul says though you do all those he says it profits you nothing it has no benefit it has no benefit eternally and it has no benefit in God's eyes this is one of the things I share with with brother vicel's friend was that these thoughts of good works the only good works that you get recognition for when it all comes down to it is those that you did to the bride of Christ did you know that because remember he'll say when I was in prison you visit me when I was naked you clothed me when I was thirsty you gave me a cup of water when I was hungry you fed me and they'll say Lord when did I ever do that and he says when you did it under these the least of my brethren you did it unto me that's the only ones you get recognition for you can do it to everyone in the world if you don't do it to a member of the bride of Christ he says depart from you that work iniquity you did great things you did them in supposedly my name you did it for your own reasons but unless you do it to somebody that I love that is a part of me it doesn't count it doesn't count he draws the line there and Paul's saying you can do all these things but without charity it profits you nothing God doesn't recognize it doesn't even go on your account he says charity suffereth long but I hate that word and anybody else hate the word and in the scriptures because it means there's more you're held to a higher standard sister Mori amen charity suffereth long and is kind oh no no we suffer well how kind are we in our suffering church that's a high standard tell you in myself I don't have that I don't have that I don't cut that I I don't hit that Mark Amen to suffer and be kind simultaneously take something greater than I've got in myself he says charity envieth not charity vonteth not itself is not puffed up and the Amplified it says is not boastful or vainglorious and does not display itself hotly it does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not our own it says that word seeketh not her own says does not on sit not does not insist on its own rights or its own way for it is not self-seeking you get this kind of love you're not looking out for yourself no it says is not easily thinketh no evil thinketh no evil that means it does not take or pay attention it does not take offense or pay attention to a suffered wrong wow somebody does you wrong and it says father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing father forgive her she doesn't know what she's doing listen to this program says in all the time these people are going on the spirit of the Living God is striving with flesh trying to get men away men away from his own achievement trying to get man away from his own selfish motives and objectives to a plan which God has laid down and as long as man Works in his own plan he will be a failure and as long as man Works in his own plan he will be a failure and a man can only achieve right when he comes back with the right objective with the right of motive and that is according to God's plan for him he says any other Foundation is on sinking Sands going back to our love chapter it says charity rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth now look at the capability of Charity in verse seven it beareth all things it believeth all things it hopeeth all things Earth all things you tell me what charity can't do it can do everything it can go through any situation can deal with any relationship deal with any person deal with any heartache deal with any sickness in your life or in somebody else's but look at verse 8. charity never faileth church that's a place I want to stand I want a love that doesn't fail I want a love that doesn't hit them you get to the bottom of the bucket and you've got nothing left to give anymore I want a charity that doesn't back down because it's not being received I want a charity that keeps going when I can't go that's greater than anything I've got in my in my own self amen it says but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease and whether they're being knowledge it shall vanish away Prophet God said this he says the Christian loves the Lord and he loves him in such a way that Paul said neither death sorrow neither perils or imprisonments and anything can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus he said in my brother when you get that in your heart with that type of love that will beat anything else you could substitute for that's exactly right I don't care how much you spoke with tongues how much you shouted how many great Services you've had or been in how well your name's on the book how many times you've been baptized in which way he says it will never amount to one thing until that real genuine Holy Ghost love sinks into your heart till you first love him above everything else there is in the world right he says we put so much stress on the evidence of the Holy Ghost the Methodist said you had to shout for you got it a lot of Methodist shouted and didn't have it the Pentecostal Smith speak with tongues when you got it a lot of them spoke in tongues and didn't have it that's right but brother when you come to a place where you God love it will never fail it will never fail he didn't say I won't fail in my flesh didn't say I won't fall down didn't say I wouldn't step away but it will never fail they have its perfect work through you it will never fail it takes time you got to have patience for this kind of love but it will never fail because it's not yours it's his amen it says for we know in part and we prophesy in part gifts and understanding are all partial here Church we don't have it all yet we got to wait to the other side to get that full understanding we only know and understand as much as is needful for our journey here no one man has it all no one Ministry has it all no one church has it all it's a global body amen it's an elected bride of Christ he says but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known he says in that hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity yo brother Eugene Braun taught me two very important things and one of the greatest ones that I I hold on to this day is he says God's love is based on your spiritual growth God's love is not here to put money in the bank it's not here to put Health in your body it's not here to make your relationships great in your family great your relationship with God is based on a love that takes you back to him look what he did to job how thou consider my servant job there's none like him in all the land a more perfect man than job did not exist at that time and what did God do took everything away from him for what his spiritual growth to give him a revelation of the Resurrection that's the kind of love we're talking about we'll cover maybe someone in the in some future services but brother Brandon would say he says he says the way we look at love is the way we look at compassion he says and we go around and we look at every single need and think that I've got to take care of that need because that's what God would do and he says that's not God's compassion God's compassion is elective and it's for the best thing for you always it's for your spiritual growth but we look at this word charity and we say what is charity we're a charitable organization we're a registered charitable organization today so people would say what is Charity well charity is giving charity is love charity is Good Will charity is helping charity is sacrifice and the apologists listed in the scriptures before and said all those things are not charity he says all of those things without charity are no good so that's not what charity is but we go back to the Greek and that that word charity is the word Agape which is the noun and then there's the word Agape which is the verb and we hear that so much we talk about agapo love agapo love is the active love of God it's God's love in action and Agape is just the the noun of it it's what it is but agapao is what it does it's how it works in these things but this is God's Own love and it's not a natural love it's not natural affection and it doesn't work the way our love does we're talking about I shall not be moved and we're talking about what God's love does for our life amen our loves makes excuses for The Giver and the receiver all the time we're making excuses for these things our love will compromise to soften an argument or allow somebody even to hold on to something that's not according to the word of God because we want to hold on to the relationship church we do it if we stop and look so many times we won't give the full truth because we value the relationship how can we value a relationship more than the word of God that's what we're doing when we do that when we pull our punches that way when we refuse to give a straight answer what we're saying is I value you more than I value the word of God and it's a compromise it's a compromise and we're being moved off of it sometimes we lose a connection anybody else lost a connection because you told somebody something straight it happens even within our own ranks but in time because that person is a child of God they come back around every time every time they come back around but what is it they're growing in God's love and God's love takes you to his word every time so that you've got a strong foundation in every situation amen the love that Paul's talking about here is completely different because our love fails our love is dependent on whether we had our coffee this morning whether we slept well last night whether somebody's been loving on us it's so dependent and therefore it's cyclical we've got good days of love and we've got low days of love in ourselves don't we but this is a love that he's talking about that never fails never fails there's nothing that can can take it there's nothing that can exhaust today man it's never failing how many of us can say our love is never failing I can't say my natural love is that's for sure it fails as I get tired as I get worn out maybe I ought to take up some coffee but it what it Ebbs and flows in and out good days bad days but this charity has Paul says this charity never fails it never fails amen church I need more of that kind of love I need something that doesn't fail day in and day out I believe I've got it I believe I've got it I'll tell you why as we start to close here amen but I want a love that honors the recipient enough to keep loving them even when they don't like what I've got for them because when we give somebody the word we're giving them the antidote to this world we're giving them the medicine that they need for this life and guess what sometimes children spit out medicine don't they sometimes adults spit out medicine too why because they don't like the taste and they're more concerned about how it tastes and how it feels and how it sits on them rather than the effect and so they start to fight you over it amen but what this is a love that never fails because I'm doing it for you not for me that's how you know it is this is about you and that's why I'm continuing to love you that's why I'm continuing to give the word I honor you enough I appreciate you enough I love you enough to keep giving you the word because that's the only thing that's going to fix you it's the only thing that's going to fix your situation Paul would say this in Romans he says in Hope maketh not ashamed but this is where this love comes from this charity we're talking about he says because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us so it's not our love it's his love it's by the Holy Ghost and it's given to us that means it's outside of us and comes into US it means you don't naturally possess it it's something that has to be delivered to you it's something that has to be given to you it's something that has to be sealed inside of us and that's something that's going to take us forward no matter what we're feeling or thinking or doing that day amen you want to love your family with this kind of love get the Holy Ghost you want to love your brothers and sisters get the Holy Ghost you want to love this world the way they need to be loved get the Holy Ghost it's the only way we'll do it otherwise we'll compromise for all sorts of other reasons amen this love will give them what they need and you can't give it to them unless you've got it yourself you can't give them what you don't have because they won't believe it unless they see it Revelation 2 19. this is a thyatiran church age I believe it says I Know Thy works and love and service and faith and thy patience and thy works again and the last to be more than the first Brother Brad would say this he says in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed lives their Works testified to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified God he said yes sir if you are a Christian you are going to do what is right your Works will show that your heart is right this is where Works come in he says and it won't be something you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it costs you your life even if it costs you your job even if it costs you your relationship even if it costs you your family why you got a new family you've got a new home you got a new job you got a new purpose those things come and go but this is a love that never fails it never leaves he says I know your love service faith and patience he says you will note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service he says Paul speaking to the Corinthians said without love I am nothing and whatever I do is without prophets profit unless it is done in love now you can see right here that these Believers weren't in that Nickelodeon in the right focus it won't put in the right time it won't put in the right motive won't put in the right of objective and because of that it won't have the right effect you need the Holy Ghost to love somebody right it's the only way you can do it because it's a love that will love whether they receive it or not whether they believe it or not whether they want it or not regardless of how they respond the Holy Ghost will keep you loving that person it'll make you love the unlovable brother Brandon would say he says that that filio love that natural love he says would see a man come over and and touch your wife and you go pull a gun and shoot him because you loved your wife he says but agape love God's love he says we'll have you put your arm around that man and pray for his lost soul sometimes we get rising up because we love our family so much we love this one so much we love that one so much and we're forgetting that there's a greater love than all of that that's supposed to guide our responses regard our actions our reactions all of these things that's what we need in these situations we can get so stubborn and say I shall not be moved but is it love that's motivating your position because you can stand there stubborn obstinate proud hottie here I am right that's not God's love it's not God's love but if you say I won't move because if I move then you don't get his love the way you need it that's going to have an effect when you tell someone that we've dealt with it with children I'm only doing this because I love you right I'm only spanking you because I love you I'm only not letting you have a chocolate bar at 9 00 PM because I love you because I want you to get your sleep because I want you to do this and that and as we're dealing with each other as we're dealing with people around this world we've got to be able to say I'm only doing this because I love you I'm only telling you what the Bible says because I love you enough to give you the opportunity to accept what God's doing to make a wrong choice right to make a wrong situation right to give you the opportunity to step into God's will instead of your own will it's the hardest thing to do sometimes is to tell somebody nothing's going to work until you make it right with the word of God it's the only thing that's going to work and otherwise fear will stay in your life stress will stay in your life you'll lose your sleep you'll use your health you'll gain your weight you'll do this you'll do that and nothing's going to change until you say Lord I'm not going to be moved from your word and where I have moved I'll come back amen you do that now you can start helping the brother next to you now you can start helping the sister next to you now you can start helping your kids now you can start helping your spouse now you can start helping your family when you've got a love that never fails because it's shed abroad by the holy spirit in your life according to the word of God and according to the leading of God I love how brother Brown said earlier he says it's God's will for you guess what brother Dale's got love to give to the world and his will be different than mine because he's got a different path than I do brother Josh got a different one and and Selena and Justine they have different paths because they're in different spheres of influence they've got these different things and God gives them leadership to do things in certain ways according to the word and it's to have an effect it's to spread that gospel amen but even amongst ourselves I can't help you if I don't give you the word of God that's why our fellowship is around the word not around feelings you know that it's so easy to compromise and I don't know why I'm continuing it's so easy to compromise because you understand you can say I've been there I know what that feels like I know how that hurts we can even say you're justified in feeling that but that doesn't justify you taking the course of action you're doing we're so willing to empathize but that's not God's love that's not God's love God's love is I understand but there's a way out there's a higher plane there's a greater love there's a deeper love there's a higher faith there's a great arrest there's a greater peace hey have you heard about forgiveness let me tell you about forgiveness whatever it is to take it to that to that person in a way to say I understand where you're at but that ain't where God is and to say here's where God is God is in his word so here's what he says to resolve it here's how he says to help it you know I I've joked as men when we're dealing with wives so often they want our understanding they want to listen near and you know what us men want we want to fix it but that happens in all sorts of relationships listening to my wife won't fix it but a lot of times it fixes a lot of the issue but if there's a root problem my listening is not enough I still have to bring a solution but sometimes I do have to gain that trust I have to listen I have to see where you're at before I can give you the answer but in the end if I don't give you the answer I haven't done anything for you except solidify you where you're at rather than point you to where God wants you to be amen amen let's bow our heads if we would Heavenly Father Lord we want to be effective Lord we want to love like you love Lord and that means we want to speak like you speak we want to think like you think we want to move like you move Lord we want to respond and react the way that you respond and react and Lord we can only do that as your holy spirit is shed abroad in our heart Lord that abroad means it's spread into every nook and cranny every corner of every room Lord it goes through every door it goes through every window Lord it saturates our life it saturates our hearts it saturates our souls it saturates our beings Lord God and God we can't give it unless we've got it so Lord I'm praying that you'll give us more of your Holy Spirit Lord I'm praying you'll give us more of that Divine love Lord that puts us into action according to your word Lord that puts us into action in a way that makes us effective for the community around us Lord that puts us into action for the good of the brothers and sisters that are gathered here and around this world as well Lord we're praying that your spirit will move in our heart sword and that when it moves or we would say I shall not be moved nor that we don't compromise Lord that we don't change our stance Lord that we don't pull our punches Lord but in love Lord we give each one your truth Lord for Thy word is truth Lord your word is truth Lord would you help us to stand strong Lord give us Faith Lord take out all fear give us words for the moment Lord to give a lord lord an explanation lord of the hope that lies within us Lord help us to be your Witnesses in our homes in this body of Believers Lord into a dying and sick world we pray Lord let us always act in love let us always act in love we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen so Josh took my song of Lord I give you my heart let's sing that song More of You
